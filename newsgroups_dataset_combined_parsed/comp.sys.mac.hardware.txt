i
believe
apple
has
a
patent
on
the
region
features
of
quickdraw
a
mac
clone
would
have
to
implement
regions
this
is
why
apples
comment
was
that
they
believe
it
is
not
possible
to
make
a
mac
clone
without
infringing
on
their
patents
they
may
have
other
patents
like
this
apple
has
patented
their
implementation
of
regions
which
presumably
includes
the
internal
data
structure
which
has
never
been
officially
documented
by
apple
apple
cannot
patent
the
concept
of
a
region
im
guessing
that
either
nutek
reverseengineered
apples
internal
data
structure
for
regions
i
dunno
if
this
would
hold
up
in
court
or
they
came
up
with
their
own
data
structure
if
its
the
latter
then
they
wont
be
able
to
draw
pict
files
containing
regions
besides
pict
files
there
arent
many
places
where
regions
are
stored
on
disk
quicktime
movies
perhaps
as
long
as
the
region
isnt
being
stored
on
disk
and
transferred
from
a
mac
to
a
nutek
clone
or
vice
versa
it
doesnt
matter
if
nutek
uses
a
completely
different
internal
data
structure
i
remember
reading
that
apple
also
has
a
patent
on
their
adb
hardware
and
that
the
nutek
clones
would
therefore
be
lacking
an
adb
port
what
other
patents
does
apple
have
on

in
comparison
to

she
complains
that
the

too
light

is
quite
apparent

dont

objectionable

indeed
rather
like
it

be
warned
that
some
people
dont
care
for

it
is
considerably
different

approximately
four
months
ago

purchased
a
quantum

from
la

for
after
two
months
the
drive
started
having
problems
first
there
were
intermittent
freezes
then
corrupted
files
and
resources
then
silverlining
wouldnt
even
recognize
the
drive
so
i
got
an
rma
from
la
cie
and
exchanged
the
new
drive
for
a
reconditioned
one
well
about
a
month
has
passed
now
and
the
second
drive
is
having
problems
often
when
i
boot
up
my
iisi
i
get
the
flashing
question
mark
sometimes
if
i
then
insert
the
silverlining
program
i
can
get
it
to
recognize
the
drive
by
making
it
scan
over
and
over
for
drives
at
that
point
i
can
restart
the
iisi
and
boot
from
the
hd
ive
called
la
cie
again
and
theyve
given
me
another
rma
their
tech
support
people
tell
me
that
if
silverlining
doesnt
see
the
drive
theres
a
definite
hardware
problem
given
that
this
is
the
second
bad
drive
in
four
months
i
asked
la
cie
to
send
me
a
new
one
but
they
said
no
also
within
three
weeks
after
i
purchased
my
original
drive
la
cie
dropped
the
price
on
it
by
over
i
can
accept
that
a
drive
or
two
may
be
bad
and
i
know
that
hardware
vendors
make
a
practice
of
sending
reconditioned
replacements
when
they
do
repairs
and
i
understand
that
the
nature
of
the
computer
industry
lends
itself
to
sudden
price
fluctuations
nevertheless
taken
together
the
convergence
of
these
factsevents
have
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
i
should
have
added
above
that
when
i
asked
la
cie
to
transfer
the
contents
of
my
current
drive
to
the
one
they
will
sendi
think
the
data
is
still
in
good
shape
and
ill
have
to
again
reinstall
everything
from
floppiesthey
said
it
would
cost
me
for
data
recovery
it
seems
to
me
that
reconditioned
hardware
should
be
sold
as
reconditioned
at
a
discounted
price
and
that
replacements
for
new
hardware
gone
bad
still
covered
under

should
be

staff
have
always

three
weeks

there
isnt
any
copyright
equivalent
of
the
res
ipsa
doctrine
but
theres
something
kind
of
similar
to
show
infringement
one
element
you
need
to
show
is
that
the
defendant
copied
from
your
work
if
youre
lucky
youll
have
direct
evidence
of
copying
the
smoking
gun
normally
you
do
this
through
circumstantial
evidence
by
showing
evidence
of
access
from
which
one
might
reasonably
infer
copying
this
evidence
of
access
is
considered
along
with
the
similarities
between
the
two
works
in
deciding
whether
you
copied
however
if
the
similarities
are
so
strong
as
to
be
striking
an
inference
of
copying
may
be
drawn
even
without
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
access
to
your
copyrighted
work
in
that
case
the
burden
will
be
on
the
defendant
to
rebut
the
inference
of
copying
for
example

hed
been

is
current
at
the

then
you
will
see
shortly
afterwards
apple
no

at
next
with
their

see
what
happens
who
is
going
to
pay
apples
prices
when
they
can
get
the

cheaper
else
where
heck
we
can
get
a

cheaper
than
a

infact
we
have
a
number

times
it
all
comes
down
to
if
apple
released
this
before
windows
was
released
id
be
behind
them
they
missed
the
boat
so
why
is
apple
continued
development
will
it
support

its
fullest
capabilities
run
faster
than
windows
it
must
do
something
significantly
better
than
windows
and
to
warrent
being
released
no
the
continued
develeopment
is
because
there
is
becomming
less
and
less
profit
in
hardware
so
the
next
step
no
pun
intendedwell
sort
of
is
to
make
the
money
in
software
look
at
microsoft
if
you
think
it
cant
happen
after
all
you
can
sell
multiple
pieces
of
software
to
one
hardware
platform
as
you
also
said
windows
is
a
nightmare
for
programmers
so
will
the
temptation
to
sell
system
to
a
couple
of
million
dos
users
be
too
much
for
apple
million

is

my
advisor
has
decided
to
get
a
mac
for
the
lab
now
that
we
are
funded
again
the
consensus
in
the
lab
was
that
all
we
really
needed
was
an
lciii
but
he
decided
he
wanted
a
centris
the
lack
of
an
fpu
on
that
machine
and
the
price
struck
me
as
making
it
worth
less
than
an
lciii
so
i
have
suggested
we
get
a
iivx
instead
it
seems
heavily
expandable
and
for
what
do
people
with
iivxs
think
of
them
they
seem
like
good
machines
to
me
and
i
like
the
nubus
slots
in
case
we
ultimately
decide
we
want
to
do
work
with
video
on
it
the
iivxlciii
performance
at
a
centris
price
the
only
reason
to
get
an
iivx
is
if
you
really
need
the
fullsize
nubus
slots
keep
in
mind
that
the
supports
all
apple
monitors
and
has
optional
ethernet
this
lessens
but
doesnt
eliminate
the
need
for
nubus
cards
and
unless
youre
running
fpuintensive
software
the
will
blow
the
doors
off
the
lciii
and
the
iivx
the
lciii
on
the
other
hand
is
sufficient
for
most
people
and
has
a
great
price
if
you
havent
guessed
i
find
halving
the
bus
clock
the
iivx
up
vs

a
throughly
bad
thing

never

i
have
no

i
installed
a
couple
of

in

and
was
somewhat
dismayed
by
the
general
complexity
of
the
operation
compared
to
for
example
the
wonderfully
designed
lc
iii
it
irritates
me
when
apple
refuses
to
tell
how
to
do
it
in
the
users
manual
so
you
have
to
guess
at
how
to
disassemble
the
devise
in
question
its
the
same
for
adding
memory
to
laserwriter
pros
it
isnt
apples
responsibility
to
tell
its
customers
how
to
fool
around
with
its
hardware
that
is
what
apple
service
techs
get
paid
to
do
i
personally
like
the
design
of
the
and
applaud
apple
for
coming
up
with
a
good
way
to
make
use
of
the
front
space
for
all
of
those
drive
bays
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
the
design
except
for
those
people
who
need
drive
arrays
i
do
however
agree
with
you
about
the
lw
pro
design
the
operation
isnt
very
complicated
if
even
a
minimal
amount
of
help
were
offered
but
apple
leaves
you
working
blind
again
itss
not
apples
place
to
make
it
easy
for
noncertified
service
people
to
fool
around
with
apple
hardware
even
if
they
did
buy
it
of
course
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
to
your
mac
just
dont
get
upset
when
your
apple
service
rep
tells
you
that
your
warranty
is
no
longer
valid
after
the
memory
was
installed
i
was
distraught
that
the
top
of
the
simms
came
into
contact
with
the
plastic
case
frame
mine
actually
contacted
the
framework
with
quite
a
lot
of
pressure
enough
so
that
the
assembly
of
the
board
back
to
the
proper
position
was
rather
difficult
and
required
some
force
i
could
have
filed
a
little
excess
material
off
the
top
of
the
simm
boards
but
chose
to
let
it
stand
as
is
i
have
not
had
problems
with
ram
yet
so
i
will
consider
the
problem
annoying
but
not
catastrophic
this
sounds
like
the
kind
of
problem
i
had
when
i
installed
simms
into
an
lc
back
before
lowprofile
simms
were
readily
available
the
standard
simms
would
contact
the
top
of
the
case
and
make
it
a
bit
difficult
to
close
the
lc
but
it
did
close
and
work
just
fine
one
of
the
nice
things
about
logicboards
is
that
they
are
generally
quite
flexible
and
can
withstand
a
fair

only
comment
on
thermal
recalibration
in
general
some
new
drives
perform
it
in
order
to
increase
overall
integrity
of
data
writes
basically
the
firmware
instructs
the
actuator
to
perform
a
test
to
see
if
the
data
tracks
are
within
a
certain
physical
tolerance
since
when
the
media
heats
up
or
cools
down
some
track
drift
is
inevitable
and
the
drive
has
to
monitor
it
this
becomes
especially
critical
at
very
high
recording
densities
and
so
was
used
primarily
on
very
largecapacity
mechanisms
but
it
seems
to
be
finding
its
way
into
more
smaller
drives
as
a
way
of
boosting
the
drives
longterm
reliability
and
mtbf
ratings
i
first
became
aware
of
thermal
recalibration
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
technique
conflicts
with
prolonged
write
times
when
digitizing
say
audio
or
video
to
hard
disk
some
manufacturers
explicitly
state
that
drives
with
thermal

are
not

be

im
having
a
real
tough
time
finding
out
the
proper
adapters
to
use
a
vga
monitor
an
ibm
sold
w
many
to
be
exact
on
the
mac
lc
iii
all
of
the
vendors
i
have
called
say
that
the
internal
video
will
not
work
on
a
true
vga
monitor
but
will
work
on
a
ibm
compatible
multisync
like
the
sonys
or
the
nec
monitors
i
thought
the
vga
capability
of
lciii
was
very
attractive
because
it
allowed
you
to
use
inexpensive
vga
monitors
am
i
confused
or
are
these
vendors
just
not
up
to
speed
has
anyone
used
an
lciii
with
a
non
multisync
vga
monitor
and
if
so
where
did
you
get
your
adapter
please
be
specific
w
vendor
and
cat
i
would
prefer
to
get
a
apple
monitor
for
these
lciiis
its
unseemly
to
see
the
finder
inside
an
ibm
bezel
but
the
more
money
we
save
on
monitors
the
more
lciiis
we
can
afford
and
the
more
we
can
get
rid

nowadays

ive
had

for

the

doesnt
come
out
at
all
despite
the
fact
that
the
mechanism
makes
all
the
appropriate
noises
and
i
have
to
grab
hold
of
it
and
pull
it
out
myself
is
there
a
simple
fix
for
this
or
do
i
have
to
return
it
to
my
apple

where
it
will
languish

i
have
a
few
questions
and
a
few
problems
first
there
seems
to
be
an

socket
on

that
i
cant

out
what
it
is
for
the

is
set
by
some
jumpers
on

bottom
so
i
dont
think
it
is
for
that
any
ideas
second
it
would
be
nice
to
get
a
hardware
manual
for
the

there
are
a
lot
of
jumpers
on
it
that
we
dont
know
what
they
are
for
third
i
have
got
the
drive
to
format
it
took
a
while
to
get
things
to
work
and
most
of
it
is
fine
for
now
the
formating
initialy
was
troublesome
but
seems
to
be
ok
the
main
problem
is
if
you
do
a
reset
on
the

the

disappears
if
i
shut
the
mac
off
and
then
back
on

that

upon

would

the

forced

to

about

does
anyone

about
it
ive
heard
that
with
most
of
these
things
you
can
still
only
use
serial
ports
at
a
time
it
just
prevents
you
from
physically
swapping

although
ive
also
heard
that
programs
that
use
the
comm
toolbox
may
be
able
to
use
as
many

as
they
want
does
anyone
know

this
is
true

the

has
a
separate

separated
from
the

which
supposedly
gives
it
a
longer
life
and
keeps
it
cleaner
with
no

a

is
also
available

i
think
the

is
better
since
you
get
the

at

slightly
lower

with

the

is

has

out
the
longest

it

i

that
the

is

cannot

enough
i
want

achieve
an
overall

rate

around
megabytes
sec
for
very
large
data
transfers
around
mb
i
have
a
quadra
i
have
a
nubus
network
card
that
can
pump
data
in
to
mac
memory
at
mbs
using
blockmode
transfers
i
have
a
highspeed
disk
array
no
asynchronous
pb
calls
that
can
achieve
mbs
lets
say
all
transfers
go
from
disk
to
buffer
to
network
card
it
is
not
enough
to
first
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
disk
to
buffer
then
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
card
mbs
then
mbs
result
in
an
overall
mbs
too
slow
so
i
tried
the
following
scheme
for
an
nmegabyte
transfer
step
load
the
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
asynch
send
mb
out
card
load
the
mb
from

step
asynch
send
mb
out
card
load
the
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
n
asynch
send
the
mb
out
card
load
the
nth
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
send
the
nth
mb
out
card
even
though
the
code
apparently
does
execute
the
card
transfer
asynchronously
and
the
card
does
not
use
the
mac
cpu
at
all
it
is
using
the
buffer
tho
each
of
the
steps
through
n
take
as
long
as
if
the
two
transfers
were
executed
one
after
another
so
there
is
no
improvement
in
the
rate
why
is
the
mac

so
the

card
and
the
disk
driver
can
both
access

at

how
does
one
get
around
that
without

use

the

cache

heres
a
question
that
may
be
simple
enough
to
answer
but
has
stumped
myself
and
a
few
others
what
does
an
external

cache
card
do
for
you
if
you
already
have
a
large
cache
set
through
control
panel
in
your

ex
i
have
a
mac
iici
with
meg
ram
an
external
video
card
so
i
dont
rob
my
simms
and
the
default
apple
cache
card
i
believe
this
is
say
i
have
my
cache
set
at
meg
what
good
does
a
measly
do
me
on
the
cache
card
could
it
actually
slow
things
down
by
dividing
the
cache
between
the
card
and
the
simms
or
does
it
still
speed
things
up
by
providing
a
secondary
staging
area
for
data
normally
passed
directly
into
the
simm
ram
cache
im
confused
because
it
seems
like
cache
cards
are
so
low
in
memory
to
really
do
any
good
compared
to
what
you
can
set
yourself
yet
daystar
fastcache
has
numbers
which
show
around
a
performance
boost
on
some
operations
are
the
chips
on
the
cache
card
simply
faster
than
most
simm
accesses
please
help
im

find
the

hello
all
i
am
thinking
about
buying
an
external
monitor
for
my
and
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
in
netland
has
any
advice
for
me
i
am
mostly
thinking
about
a
color
monitor
and
an
bit
card
that
can
switch
between
and
something
higher
like
i
read
an
old
report
on
a
card
from
lapis
that
could
do
this
but
could
not
use
the
external
monitor
as
the
main
screen
with
menubar
which
to
me
is
a
major
draw
back
has
this
perhaps
been
fixed
or
can
any
other
cards
do
this
like
the
micron
xceed
also
which
monitor
should
i
buy
at
the
moment
i
am
leaning
towards
the
sony
or
what
exactly
is
the
difference
between
these
but
are
there
any
other
good
cheap
monitors
i
should
know
about
doesnt
the
monitor
have
to
be
multisync
to
support
cards
that
can
switch
resolutions
please
send
me
email
and
ill
summarize
i
would
also
greatly
appreciate
getting

believe

in

you
must
remove
the

there
you
should
find
two

rather

this
sounds
more
like
a

should
there
be

what

problem
is
that

excuse

this

i

couldnt
really
find

i
have

i
want
need
to
add
additional

im
on

i
really
dont
need
more

so
what
is
the
best
performance
wise
and
most
economical
way
to
do
this
someone
told
me
that

should
only
use
simms
of
the

amount
of

that
is

what
if
i
just
wanted
to
buy
just

use
the

already
have

you
can
find
retail
that
is
within
the
price
of
a
keyboard
of
educational
prices
i
would
be
very
wary
of
retail
outlets
selling
as
cheap
as
educational
prices
i
went
for
a
retailer
actually
mail
order
cda
computers
because
its
price
was
better
thant
the
campus
computer
store
i
found
out
why
later
on
when
i
tried
to
get
a
repair
done
at
an
apple
registered
repair
center
the
cpu
was
a
resale
the
serial
number
had
been
removed
and
replaced
with
a
nonstandard
number
probably
from
cda
computers
consequently
the
apple
repair
man
could
not
do
any
warrenty
repairs
so
i
ended
up
with
just
a
warrenty
from
cda
over
the
apple
warrenty
boy
was
i
pied
moral
of
the
story
caveat
emptor
however
if
you
go
with
a
reliable
trustworthy
mail
order
firm
if
they
exist
maybe
someone
could
enlighten
us
with
their
experiences
you
will
probably
get
a
better
price
than
your
local
educational
outlet
simply
because
mail
order
out
of
state
does
not
require
sales
tax
yet
though
for
how
much
longer
remains
to
be
seen
the
addition
in
sales
tax
on
a
cpu
purchase
will
probably
wipe
out
an
educational
discount
again
caveat
emptor
some
mail
order
companies
do
include
sales
tax
on
purchases
even
if
they
are

the

and

cant
why
couldnt

can
figure

if
theres
any

using

do

dare
just
try

you
can
find
retail
that
is
within
the
price
of
a
keyboard
of
educational
prices
i
would
be
very
wary
of
retail
outlets
selling
as
cheap
as
educational
prices
i
went
for
a
retailer
actually
mail
order
cda
computers
because
its
price
was
better
thant
the
campus
computer
store
i
found
out
why
later
on
when
i
tried
to
get
a
repair
done
at
an
apple
registered
repair
center
the
cpu
was
a
resale
the
serial
number
had
been
removed
and
replaced
with
a
nonstandard
number
probably
from
cda
computers
consequently
the
apple
repair
man
could
not
do
any
warrenty
repairs
so
i
ended
up
with
just
a
warrenty
from
cda
over
the
apple
warrenty
boy
was
i
pied
moral
of
the
story
caveat
emptor
apple
does
not
authorise
sales
through
mail
order
as
a
result
mail
order
companies
have
to
obtain
their
machines
by
the
grey
market
this
market
is
supplied
with
machines
from
authorised
resellers
who
have
more
machines
than
they
can
sell
they
come
into
this
state
of
affairs
by
overordering
either
accidentally
or
deliberatly
to
get
a
better
wholsale
price
from
apple
in
either
case
they
often
obscure
the
serial
nunber
to
protect
their
identity
as
a
result
the
warranty
is
void
you
may
save
on
sales
tax
but
you
have
to
pay
for
shipping
i
should
also
point
out
that
mail
order
companies
cannot
get
lower
prices
thatn
the
high
volume
authorised
dealers
unless
they
buy
below
dealer
cost
as
a
result
the
only
way
they
can
sell
cheaper
is
by
cutting
costs
and
trimming
margins
unfortunatly
they
dont
seem
to
be
doing
too
well
the
lowest
prices
i
have
been
quoted
mailorder
do
not
beat
the
lowest
prices
available
from
authorised
local
dealers
they
are
even
further

ben
roy
just
a
poor
college
ben
since
youre
obviously
adept
enough
to
understand
how
the
trackball
works
the
only
thing
short
of
repairing
it
that
i
can
think
of
is
a
thorough
cleaning
of
all
the
parts
and
then
checking
for
the
proper
placement
of
the
little
blue
rollers
since
they
arent
fixed
in
position
on
their
stainless
steel
pins
you
might
try
sliding
them
into
a
slightly
different
position
on
my
powerbook
i
can
slide
them
almost
completely
out
of
contact
with
the
trackball
in
fact
one
of
the
notes
from
sumex
on
fixing
the
trackball
advocates
sliding
the
roller
so
that
its
edge
contacts
the
ball
not
the
center
cylindrical
area
ive
done
this
with
my
and
it
does
seem
to
improve
the
feel
but
needs
to
be
adjusted
from
time
to
time
i
just
popped
open
one
of
our
offices
and
while
there
isnt
as
much
latitude
for
movement
one
could
still
adjust
the
roller
slightly
if
your
is
the
same
it
might
help
i
would
suspect
the
most
likely
culprit
to
be
a
slippery
blue
roller
if
you
can
take
it
out
clean
it
with
a
mild
soapy
solution
or
isopropyl
alcohol
also
be
sure
the
ball
is
greasefree
if
you
drop
the
ball
in
minus
the
retaining
ring
roll
the
ball
and
see
if
it
is
actually
causing
the
axle
to
spin
if
all
this
still
doesnt
solve
it
then
maybe
a
new
one
is
in
order
it
could
be
an
electrical
connection
in
which
case
replacement
would
be
necessary
but
my
experience
with
both
mice
and
trackballs
has
been
that
dirt
has
been
the
normal
problem
not
an
electrical
malfunction
hope
this
helps

hello

i
have
a

to
have
a

waking
up
from
sleep
when
running
on

power
when
woken
usually
for
the

after
sleeping
the

the

appears
with
a

of
broken
horizontal
lines
and
control
can
only
be
recovered
with
controlcommandpoweron
or
the
reset
key
at
the
back
of
the
machine
the
problem
occurs
even
when
the
system
is
stock
standard
no
extensions
no
virtual
memory
a
fully
charged
new
battery
system
etc
i
have
not
had
the
problem
when
the
machine
is
plugged
in
to
ac
ive
checked
that
the
battery
is
properly
seated
it
appears
to
be
fine
whats
going

anyone

had
this

is
it

if
you
have

a

try
repeatedly

only

so
your

bet
thats

only
the

the
and
all
have
a

only
i
distinctly
remembered
this
because
when
got
the

and
i
thought
all
of

are
going

be
thinwire
i
eventually
had
to
go
back

ordered
destas
decs
oversized
version
of
an
auitobnc
adapter
that
must
be
used
with
a
transciever
cable
for
the
rest
of
the

my
advise
to
the
very
original
poster
beverly
is
if
all
you
want
is
to
create
a
lan
with
two
workstations
and
wont
add
machines
to
it
ever
go
for
thinwire
regardless
of
the
media
type
going
for
utp
unshielded
twisted
pair
wiring
requires
a
concentrator
which
means
extra
money
and
i
believe
these
units
come
with
at
least
ports
as
for
thicknet
its
a
nightmare
and
cabling
is
expensive
avoid
it
unless
you
have
no
choice
eg
the
two
machines
are
two
floors
parts
on
the
mac
side
you
will
need
one
thinwire
media
adapter
from
apple
or
thirdparty
macx
make
sure
you
get
version
wont
run
on
system
mactcp
which
comes
with
macx
if
you
get
macx
you
should
be
getting
mactcp
with
it
dont
use
earlier
versions
on
a
centris
you
may
or
may
not
need
a
terminator
depending
on
the
thinwire
media
adapter
so
just
ask
the
sales
if
the
adapter
is
selfterminated
or
not
configure
mactcp
to
use
ethernet
on
the
decstation
side
you
will
need
for
a
model
you
will
only
need
a
tconnector
for
models
you
will
need
an
auitobnc
adapter
get
one
that
can
be
plugged
in
directly
to
the
aui
port
of
the
decstation
this
way
you
save
the
cost
of
a
transciever
cable
a
aui
male
to
a
aui
female
cable
get
a

your

converting
keyboard
for
mac
plus
i
have
an
old
mac
plus
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
bought
a
shiney
new
lc
it
came
with
apples
new
keyboard
with
abd
ports
i
replaced
it
with
a
macproplus
extended
keyboard
which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
thank
you
very
much
well
i
have
this
extra
keyboard
which
i
would
like
to
use
on
the
plus
but
theres
a
little
problem
the
plus
uses
an
jack
for
keyboard
input
and
the
new
keyboards
dont
i
got
an
extra
adb
cable
from
my
local
apple
dealer
theyre
such
nice
people
but
they
couldnt
tell
me
the
order
of
the
wires
there
are
four
wires
in
the
adb
cables
black
white
red
tan
i
know
ones
a
ground
one
gets
the
serial
signal
one
supplies
volts
and
i
forgot
what
the
fourth
one
does
anyway
if
you
hook
them
up
wrong
youll
fry
a
board
and
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
if
any
brave
souls
out
there
have
done
this
before
please
email
your
experience
directly
to
me
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
especially
since
apples
original
keyboard
is
not
ergonomically
correct
btw
i
did
take
apart
my
new
keyboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
correlation
between
the
wires
for
the
jack
and
the
adb
since
it
has
both
but
no
such
luck
the
connections
are
soldered
inside

just

it

sometimes
it
will
just
freeze

other
times
it
will
give
me
the
usual

the

message

not

i
know
one
solution
is
not
to
put
the
machine
to
sleep
but
does
anyone
have
any
ideas
on
what
could
be
causing
this
or
better
yet
what
might
fix
it
the
memory
card
is
psuedostatic
ram
and
goes
into
the
pds
slot
that
probably
figures
into
the
problem
the
manufacturer
is

not

the

is

adding
int
hard

drive
to
iicx
i
havent
seen
much
info
about
how
to
add
an
extra
internal
disk
to
a
mac
we
would
like
to
try
it
and
i
wonder
if
someone
had
some
good
advice
we
have
a
mac
iicx
with
the
original
internal
quantum
hard
disk
and
an
unusable
floppy
drive
we
also
have
a
new
spare
connor
disk
which
we
would
like
to
use
the
idea
is
to
replace
the
broken
floppy
drive
with
the
new
hard
disk
but
there
seems
to
be
some
problems
the
internal
scsi
cable
and
power
cable
inside
the
cx
has
only
connectors
for
one
single
hard
disk
drive
if
i
made
a
ribbon
cable
and
a
power
cable
with
three
connectors
each
for
motherboard
for
each
of
the
disks
would
it
work
is
the
iicx
able
to
supply
the
extra
power
to
the
extra
disk
what
about
terminators
i
suppose
that
i
should
remove
the
resistor
packs
from
the
disk
that
is
closest
to
the
motherboard
but
leave
them
installed
in
the
other
disk
the
scsi
id
jumpers
should
also
be
changed
so
that
the
new
disk
gets
id
the
old
one
should
have
id
it
is
no
problem
for
us
to
remove
the
floppy
drive
as
we
have
an
external
floppy
that
we
can

i
booted

i
installed

they
either

silverlining
claimed
it
was
a

it
is
a

well
id
backed
things
up
so
i
was
able

work

at

i
noticed

reappeared
now

holding

the

wont
which

its

while
contemplating
placing
my

i
received
a
response
from
someone
at

sorry
i
trashed
the
message
stating
that
most
newer
drives
seagates
at
the
least
can
very
well
compensate
for
gravity
this
means
that
a
horizontally
formatted
drive
can
be
later
placed
vertically
with
no
data
integrity
problems
the
only
way
that
newer
drives
cannot
work
is
if
you
have
varying
forces
shaking
bouncing
etc
so
dont
place
the
drive
on
its

a
rocking
chair
what
constitutes
a

attention
mac
quadra

many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded

mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
an
example
would
be
a
sony

without
the
special
maccompatible
firmware
installed
one
solution
sometimes
is
to
disable
blind
writes
this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the
if
so
the
mac
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by
the
chip
about
the
only
the
timing
could
be
wrong
is
if
apple
programs
the
clock
registers
wrong
on
the
that
however
should
only
really
hurt
synchronous
transfer
which
is
not
used
by
the

furthermore
disabling
blind

should
be
meaningless
on
a
quadra

macs
that
used
the
which
is
a
much
lower
level
scsi

the

was
responsible
for
the

transferred
blind
mode
affected
how
the

handled
that
handshake

the
the
handshake
is
entirely
handled
by

i
cannot
speak
for
dale
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
macintosh
uses
the
full

data
path
to
its
full
advantage
that
is
it
is
running
as
fast
with
two
or
four
simms
as
it
would
with
one
simm
now
it
may
be
that
longword
accesses
assuming
a
data
path
here
get
the
first
byte
from
the
first
simm
the
second
byte
from
the
second
and
so
on
this
would
mean
that
each
longword
of
memory
is
actually
split
among
four
simms
one
for
each
byte
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
that
the
simms
are
interleaved
by
word
or
longword
not
just
by
byte
or
they
could
be
successive
in
memory
and
the
memory
controller
deals
with
the
eightbit
data
path
that
each
one
has
i
suspect
though
that
they
are
interleaved
to
some
extent
so
that
bits
can
be
read
or
written
at
once
this
would
indicate
a
bytelevel
interleave
i
am
not
confusing
this
with
the
new

longword
interleave
with
two
simms
of
the

sort

that
seems
to
be
the

sort
of
idea
there
you
get

me
to
ram
instead
of
just
a
one
yes
the

cant
handle

when

it
speeds
something
up
so
dale
am
i
right
simms

interleaved

allowing

keyboard
question

old
mac

a
couple
of

i
bought

new

it
came

apples

with

i
replaced
it
with
a

which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
thank
you
very
much
well
i
have
this
extra
keyboard
which
i
would
like
to
use
on
the
plus
but
theres
a
little
problem
the
plus
uses
an
jack
for
keyboard
input
and
the
new
keyboards
dont
i
got
an
extra
adb
cable
from
my
local
apple
dealer
theyre
such
nice
people
but
they
couldnt
tell
me
the
order
of
the
wires
there
are
four
wires
in
the
adb
cables
black
white
red
tan
i
know
ones
a
ground
one
gets
the
serial
signal
one
supplies
volts
and
i
forgot
what
the
fourth
one
does
anyway
if
you
hook
them
up
wrong
youll
fry
a
board
and
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
if
any
brave
souls
out
there
have
done
this
before
please
email
your
experience
directly
to
me
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
especially
since
apples
original
keyboard
is
not
ergonomically
correct
btw
i
did
take
apart
my
new
keyboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
correlation
between
the
wires
for
the
jack
and
the
adb
since
it
has
both
but
no
such
luck
the
connections
are
soldered
inside
of
little
boxes
oh
well
one
more
thing
in
case
you
are
thinking
that
the
abd
ports
on
the
newer
models
are
different
from
the
connection
used
on
the
plus
youre
right
however
you
can
use
the
telephone
cable
from
the
plus
and
connect
the
macproplus
keyboard
via
its
own
jack
in
other
words
this
little
engineering
feat
i
wish
to
do
is
possible
its
merely
a
matter
of
finding
out
the
correct
order
omt
when

this

i

been
watching

the
plan
i
have
is
to
build
a
small

with
a
few
different
crystals
on
it
and
to
be
able
to
switch
between
the
different

using
a
front
pannel
switch
this
way
i
can
get
the
speed
when
i
want
but
i
can
also
run
at
slower
stock
speeds
it
i
experience
any
compatability
problems
with
any
applications
i
dont
expect
to
be
able
to
switch
clock
speeds
with
the
system
running
but
if
i
can
switch
without
any
lockup
problems
then
i
could
switch
to
when
needed
and
put
it
back
to
idle
mhz
when
not
needeed
this
would
further
reduce
the
wearandtear
on
the
cpu
even
with
a
heat
sink
of
course
i
would
not
want
to
run
the
different
clock
signals
through
the
switch
but
use
a
chip
or
two
on
the
board
to
select
the
frequency
desired
and
route
it

i
remember
reading
a
thread
a
few
days
ago
that
mentioned
removing
an
external
syquest
drive
from
its
case
and
dropping
it
in
the
internal
drive
of
a
centris
i
was
going
to
do
that
with
my
but
had
a
couple
of
questions
my
pli
syquest
drive
has
a
wire
from
the
drive
to
an
id
switch
on
the
outside
of
the
case
where
do
i
connect
this
switch
can
the
computer
just
tell
with
internal

i
noticed
that
the
drive
will
lay
over
part
of
the
motherboard
i
didnt
look
closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the
ram
thats
soldered
onto
the
motherboard
would
that
cause
problems
one
last
question
is
there
anywhere
to
order
a
faceplate
cover
the

front
panel
is
smaller
than
the
space
left
in

the

but
i

it
ends
up
costing
more
greg

actually
an
accelerator
such
as
the
daystar
mhz
is
cheaper
than
upgrading
to
a
mhz
the
accelerator
costs
about
whereas
the
upgrade
costs
just
quoted
from
my
dealer
however
the
upgrade
gives
you
very
fast
built
in
video
that
supports
monitors
up
to
with
bit
depth
and
up
to
at
bit
depth
with
additional
vram
it
also
has
a
scsi

capable
of
a
much
faster
throughput
than
the

which
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
have

if
the

scsi
woes
on
mac
iifx
i
am
having
trouble
with
scsi
on
a
mac
iifx
the
machine
is
years
old
and
i
have
been
using
the
same
hard
drive
internal
maxtor
for
two
and
a
half
years
the
disk
recently
crashed
i
reformatted
silverlining
but
during
the
reformat
i
received
random
write
errors
during
testing
the
error
message
reported
was
like
sector
write
error
detected
after
testing
good
sector
not
mapped
out
this
occurred
randomly
all
over
the
hard
disk
which
makes
me
suspect
the
diagnostics
reference
to
sector
on
the
third
reformat
and
after
reinstalling
the
scsi
readwrite
loops
i
was
able
to
get
through
passes
and
with
no
errors
pass
for
some
reason
reported
a
lot
of
errors
but
still
mapped
out
no
sectors
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
try
to
resinstall
system
and
reload
my
data
from
a
backup
this
proceded
normally
however
i
now
have
suboptimal
performance
symptoms
include
o
frequent
crashes
o
instances
of
extremely
sluggish
disk
access
requiring
a
reboot
to
correct
o
instances
of
not
finding
the
disk
on
the
scsi
chain
on
reboot
if
i
boot
from
norton
utl
after
this
occurs
it
cannot
find
the
disk
either
the
only
thing
that
fixes
this
is
recycling
the
power
it
sometimes
requires
several
attempts
questions
has
anyone
had
this
type
of
problem
before
is
the
problem
with
the
fx
motherboard
and
its
nonstandard
scsi
implementation
or
with
my
maxtor
disk
is
there
some
diagnostic
software
that
would
help
me
make
this
determination
is
it
a
termination
problem
i
currently
have
external
syquest
and
an
external
dataframe
on
the
chain
the
is
at
the
end
and
has
internal
termination
so
i
am
not
using
the
iifx
terminator
i
do
have
the
scsi
filter
installed
on
the
internal
drive
i
have
run
with
this
exact
steup
for
years
with
one
previous
disk
crash
requiring
a
reformat
about
a
year
ago
i
also
have
symptoms
if
i
disconnect
the
external
devices
so
i
dont
see
how
scsi
termination
would
now
be
an
issue
of
course
who
knows

would

appreciated

its
not
a
good
idea
to
have
a
horizontally

in
a
vertical

if
the
drive
is
formatted
in
a
horizontal
position
it
can
not
completely
compensate
for
the
gravitational
pull
in
a
vertical

im
not
saying
that
your

will
fail
tomorrow

why
take
that
chance
if
you
want
more
detailed
info
on

please
i
think
the
other
replies
sum
up
the
fact
that
you
can
place
a
hard

on
its
side
the
point
is
this
will
only
be
sure
to
work
on
the

namely
ht
lps
drives
that
have
a

why
should
i
take

a

thats

will
it

will
it

for

allowed

i

thats
getting

also
any

i
heard
an

mumble
something
about
the
arrival
of

at
a
much
earlier
date
that

i
doubt
its
true
finally
is
the

hello
all
for
few
past
days
ive
been
fighting
to
get
my
nec
multisync
predecessor
of
to
work
properly
with
the
internal
video
of
mac
iivi
with
a
vgaadapter
as
described
in
dale
adams
posting
about
quadra
video
it
works
only
some
minor
interferences
occur
small
enough
not
to
prevent
any
action
on
screen
to
be
visible
clear
but
because
the
scanrates
stuff
of
are
well
enough
for
emulating
apple
rgb
i
first
made
an
adapter
then
got
one
fron
the
local
distributor
of
nec
with
both
adapters
i
can
get
a
picure
which
looks
excellent
most
of
the
time
or
every
now
and
then
but
with
radical
changes
on
screen
opening
palettes
large
windows
etc
there
are
major
interferences
in
sync
the
picture
either
tilts
sideways
or
scrables
up
totally
even
when
it
is
clear
there
are
some
spiky
interferences
on
horizontal
line
alignment
when
accessing
pulldowns
etc
with
the
selfmade
adapter
almost
identical
to
the
vga
one
only
sense
pins
differ
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
even
boot
up
with
a
picture
clear
enough
to
shut
down
from
menu
with
the
adapter
from
nec
everything
is
well
most
of
the
time
but
sometimes
the
picture
tilts
badly
sideways
or
the
sync
is
completely
lost
but
not
nearly
as
often
as
with
the
selfmade
one
i
know
with
self
made
adapters
there
can
always
be
interference
but
with
the
one
provided
by
nec
wheres
the
source
of
this
interference
ill
give
you
the
pinouts
of
the
whole
mess

you
can

mac

many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
thats
fine
but
would
you
name
the
industy
experts
so
i
can
try
to
track
this
down
who
knows
i
just
quoted
what
was
written
in

this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the

so
the
mac
has
nothing
to

with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by

yup
thats
why
im
kinda
curious
most

you
would

only

think
that
the
main
problem
is
that
they

more

the

in

between
say
a

so
unless
you
need
lots
of
nubus
slots
its
not
worth
the
bother
of
course
it
may
be
that
these
extra

so

no

nubus
technology
isnt
a

apple
proprietry

i
have
this
sneaky
feeling
that
it
is
licensed
from
texas
instruments
so
there
is
no
problem
building
an
expansion
box
the
difference
between
nubus
and
pds
is
that
nubus
is
a
clever
interface
with
lots
of
neat
toys
built
in
to
make
sure
that
lots
of
cards
can
work
together
on
the
same
computer
pds
processor
direct
slot
is
just
that
here
are
all
the
connections
to
the
processor
you
can
do
anything
with
this
and
it
is
as
quick
as
it
can
be
but
theres
no
cooperation
you
may
be
able
to
get
double
pds
slot
adaptors
but
you
try
plugging
video
cards
in
and
just
watch
them
conflict
of
course
the
extra
electronics
in
a
nubus
slot
makes
it
appreciably
more
expensive
so
guess
why
apple
doesnt
put
it
in
its
cheaper
machines
so
yah
pays
yer
money
and
yah
takes
yah
choice

on

where
do
i
connect
this
switch
can
the

just
tell
with

you
probably
want
to
hardwire
the
scsi
id
with
shorting

put
it
at
a
convenient

like
you
could
cut
a
hole
in

machine
to
route
the

switch
but
why
go
through
the
hassle
you
probably
wont
be
needing
to
frequently
change
the
id
of
your
internal
drive
i
noticed
that
the
drive
will
lay
over
part
of
the
motherboard
i
didnt
look
closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the
ram
thats
soldered
onto
the
motherboard
would
that
cause
problems
yeah
when
i
first
installed
the
tape
drive
i
was
a
little
concerned
too
but
its
no
problem
the
device
is
designed
to
fit
just
fine
with
the
overhang
it
shouldnt
reach

though
one
last
question
is
there
anywhere
to
order
a

cover
the

front
panel
is
smaller
than
the

left
in

case
the

is
the

size
as
the
spotsbm
clones
cases
should
i
just
cut
a
hole
in
the
plastic
panel
that
is
currently
holding
tmpty
place
you
can
specialorder

the

are

note
apples
unfortunate

the

techs
i

said
oh
sure
we
stock
those

course
they
were
thinking
of
the
cd
caddies
to
hold
a
cd
disk
when
you
stick
it
in

drive
as
far
as
i
can
tell
apple
does
not
sell
a
bezel
faceplate
already
cut
out
for
a
standard
device
why
not
they
advertise
these
machines
as
being
able
to
accept
any
standard
device
in
the
bay
why
not
provide
the
faceplate
they
do
sell
a
cutout
for

of
course
but
thats
of
no
use
im

hello
mr
au
i
have
to
disagree
regarding
your
assessment
of
macintosh
in
hong
kong
the
mac
has
a
sizeable
share
of
the
typesetting
market
as
in
the
us
a
local
magazine
next
magazine
similar
to
newsweek
here
uses
the
mac
extensively
i
have
seen
sir
speedy
and
other
franchises
in
hong
kong
equipped
with
macbased
systems
true
the
discount
is
not
as
steep
as
here
because
customers
in
hong
kong
cannot
buy
from
gray
market
nor
are
mac
being
sold
thru
mass
merchandisers
like
apple
does
here
with
the
performa
lin
e
at
this
point
the
sale
of
mac
is
handled
by
one
exclusive
distributor
on
the
other
hand
you
can
always
get
a
pc
clone
or
in
the
earlier
days
illegal
clones
of
the
apple
iie
your
perception
of
the
mac
not
being
too
popular
in
hong
kong
is
simply
because
most
hobbyists
and
users
find
it
much
cheaper
to
go
to
one
of
those
basement
stores
that
sell
pc
clones
with
probably
illegal
copies
of
bios
than
to
pay
for
a
mac
similarly
you
cannot
say
lotus
surely
is
not
well
accepted
in
hong
kong
because
the
sale
is
so
low
may
be
it
is
because
of
all
those
places
in
kowloon
where
illegal
copies
of
lotus
can
be
bought
for
and
for
a
professional
looking

illegal

of

zyxel

i
recently
got
a
zyxel
modem
its
great
but
im
still
having
some
problems
figuring
out
what
strings
to
use
in
what
applications
i
basically
need
strings
for
zterm
firstclass
client
and
telefinder
client
ive
been
able
to
get
firstclass
and
zterm
working
by
using
another
modems
settings
in
firstclass
and
copying
them
for
zterm
however
it
still
has
problems
zterm
for
example
will
list
error
the
first
time
i
try
dialing
after
starting
the
problem
if
i
cancel
and
try
again
it
works
fine
telefinder
is
even
worse
i
cant
get
it
to
even
wake
up
the
modem
so
if
anyone
uses
a
zyxel
for
any
of
these
programs
id
greatly
appreciate
you
sending
me
the

you
use

what

youve

done

stores

its
the

when

starts

have
the

just
insures

is
used
useful
if
starting
zterm
after
using
something
like
the
fax
software
or
macwoof
which
change
the
settings
in
other
ways
alternatively
you
could
leave
the
factory
default
the
way
it
is
and
just
set
the
zterm
initialization
string
to
which
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
if
the

is
always
on
before
you
start
zterm
and
if

dont
modify
the
settings
or
would
work
even
if
other

modify
the

i
do
it
the
way
i
do
because
i
sometimes
forget
to
turn
on
the
modem
before
launching
zterm
and
this
way
im
assured
of
having
the
correct
dtr

powered
up

hi

just
the

i
ordered

connection
they
sent
it
overnight
very
nice
and
i
got

we
found

it
didnt
work
properly

you
put
the

the
bottom

the

using

is
all
flickering
and
fuzzy
so
i
called
them
up
and
im
going
to
return
it
for
a
new
one
my
question
is
how
often
does
such
a
thing
happen
with
simm
chips
in
general
do
you
often
find
when
ordering
chips
that
a
large
portion
are
bad
is
this
a
rarity
this
is
the
first
chip
ive
ordered
so
i
have
no
other
experience
in
this
area
im
just
curious
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
type
of
experience
thats

it

email
me

if
people
want

re

a
professor
of
mine
once
said
the
difference
between
a
computer
engineer
and
a
computer
scientist
is
about
meaning
the
engineer
makes
more
than
the
cs
seriously
though
the
main
difference
is
that
most
cs
people
write
programs
that
people
will
use
ie
database
graphics
word
processors
etc
while
an
engineer
writes
for
machines
or
control
systems
ie
the
computer
in
your
car
a
flight
control
system
computer
controled
devices
etc
in
other
words
cs
writes
software
while
cse
writes
firmware
these
are
generalizations
but
for
the
most

that
is
what
the
difference
is

the

here
is
my
worth
advice
from
a
grad
student
i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
comment
before
me
the
important
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
it
in
my
five
years
of
education
in
this
field
though
brief
compare
to
alot
of
people
i
had
to
think
about
this
kind
of
question
a
lot
did
i
make
the
right
decision
in
going
into
electrical
engineering
as
opposed
to
computer
engineering
or
cs
the
more
i
go
thru
school
the
more
i
believe
that
this
kind
of
question
is
irrelevant
i
have
come
to
believe
that
choosing
cs
because
one
does
not
like
hardware
or
choosing
hardware
because
one
does
not
like
to
program
is
really
doing
an
injustice
of
building
and
computer
and
making
it
useful
for
something
everything
is
interwoven
and
inseparable
cs
ce
and
ee
are
all
a
part
of
a
really
great
discipline
and
do
depend
on
each
other
my
advice
is
dont
limit
yourself
but
make
a
decision
based
on
which
major
will
give
you
the
best
opportunities
to
learn
that
of
course
depends
on
the
curriculum
at
your
persective
school
i
would
choose
a
major
that
allows
me
to

i
just
got
a
duo
and
im
having
some
difficulties
if
the
machine
is
plugged
in
to
the
wall
adapter
put
to
sleep
unplugged
from
the
wall
and
woken
up
it
crashes
of
the
time
theres
nothing
but
the
original
system
software
on
the
machine
the
battery
has
plenty
of
life
i
think
this
must
be
a
power
manager
problem
but
i
dont
know
what
to
do
about
it
also
the
speaker
occasionally
makes
a
highpitched
hiss
the
noise
is
irregular
but
seems
to
favor
sleep
and
restart
commands
ive
had
my
duo
for
a
few
weeks
now
and
suffer
from
both
of
the
above
problems
i
reinstalled
my
system
software
twice
in
an
effort
to
combat
the
problems
thinking
they
were
system
software
problems
initially
reinstalling
the
system
seemed
to
help
but
not
anymore
occasionally
when
i
try
to
wake
up
the
duo
i
get
a
solid
screen
of
horizontal
lines
on
the
screen
it
freezes
i
also
get
the
highpitched
hiss
occasionally
but
only
at
startup
ive
called
the
apple
hotline
sosappl
three
times
already
and
finally
they
agreed
something
is
astray
after
my
duos
screen
would
go
dim
and
the
hard
drive
spun
down
by
itselft
and
put
itself
to
sleep
this
problem
only
occured
twice
apple
sent
me
a
box
to
ship
my
duo
to
be
looked
at
in
new
york
but
the
problem
now
is
intermittent
and
i
cant
afford
to
be
without
my
duo
at
this
time
anyone
out
there
with
these

quite
a

people
it
seems
from
discussions
ive
had
me
included
i
bought
my
machine
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
as
well
and
started
to
experience
these
problems
apple
australia
via
my
dealer
said
that
this
problem
has
a
number
of
potential
causes
faulty
applications
faulty
third
party
hardware
modems
memory
etc
system
software
pram
corruption
and
power
manager
corruption
and
the
duo
hardware
itself
none
of
the
above
are
relevant
in
my
case
except
the
last
two
maybe
no
applications
were
running
the
system
software
was
reinstalled
i
have
no
additional
hardware
i
have
found
that
clearing
pram
appears
to
help
for
a
while
at
least
hold
down
command
option
p
and
r
on
startup
unfortunately
the
problem
returns
suggesting
that
pram
is
being
corrupted
by
something
system
software
bug
i
dont
have
any
nonissue
inits
in
my
system
apparently
the
power
manager
can
be
reset
by
holding
the
reset
and
interrupt
buttons
while
powering
up
apples
advice
but
since
the
duo
does
not
have
an
interrupt
button
im
not
sure
what
they
mean
in
this
case
this
may
also
help
if
someone
can
decipher
apples
advice
for
me
beyond
this
apple
suggest
that
you
should
follow
the
technical
procedures
to
check
the
hardware
of
this
duo
since
so
many
others
appear
to
be
having
the
same
problem
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
has
been
a
system
software
bug
introduced
somewhere
along
the
line
and
quite
recently
too
since
it
only
seems
to
be
recent

devices
i
just
hooked
up
my
mac
iisi
to
a
relatively
old
year
asante
ensc
adapter
the
connection
works
like
a
charm
i
installed
the
newest
drivers
from
asantes
ftp
server
the
problem
begins
when
i
attach
one
more
device
to
the
scsi
chain
specifically
a
drive
i
power
up
the
drive
then
the
mac
the
mac
tests
memory
etc
just
before
the
happy
mac
face
normally
shows
up
the
power
light
on
the
ensc
goes
out
and
the
boot
process
stops
so
i
can
use
the
network
or
the
external
drive
but
not
both
at
once
this
makes
the
asante
box
pretty
much
unusable
it
doesnt
look
like
a
purely
electrical
scsi
problem
because
if
i
turn
on
the
drive
just
a
second
or
so
too
late
so
that
it
doesnt
get
noticed
during
the
initial
scsi
polling
the
mac
boots
normally
and
the
adapter
works
even
though
the
hard
disk
is
powered
on
and
connected
the
mac
has
never
once
failed
to
boot
from
its
internal
drive
up
to
now
and
ive
had
it
for
over
a
year
here
is
what
i
tried
changing
the
scsi
ids
of
the
ensc
and
the
disk
several
permutations
changing
the
order
of
devices
ie
the
ensc
at
the
head
or
tail
of
the
chain
overterminating
with
an
external
terminator
both
devices
have
internal
ones
underterminating
ie
removing
internal
resistors
from
the
hard
disk
trying
another
ensc
box
trying
another
identical
drive
trying
several
different
scsi
cables
has
anybody
seen
this
more
importantly
does
anyone
have
a
solution

anyone

ive

fpu

i
know
from
what
weve
discussed
in
this
newsgroup
that
all
have
the
fpu
built
in
except
the
configuration
why
would
they
be
so
unclear
about
this
issue
in
their
price
list
im
planning
to
buy
the
pretty
soon
but
im
now
getting
confused
with
whether
it
comes
with
fpu
or
not
why
say
optional
if
its
built
in
please
anybody
help
me
understand
this
game
regards
thian
if
you
get
the
centris
with
cd
configuration
you
are
getting
a
mac
with
a
processor
that
has
builtin
math
coprocessor
support
my
understanding
is
that
the
optional
fpu
refers
to
your
option
of
purchasing
the
centris
without
fpu
or
one
of
the
other
configurations
with
fpu
apple
does
not
offer
an
upgrade
from
the
nonfpu
system
to
become
an
fpu
system
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
processor
on
the
nonfpu
system
a
can
be
replaced
with
a
supplied
by
another
vendor
apple
did
send
a
memo
out
at
one
point
sating
that
the
centris
which
only
comes
with
a
nonfpu
processor
cannot
be
upgraded
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configurations
of
the
two
chips
apparently
do
not
match
so
you
cannot
swap
one
for
another
again
according
to
apples
memo
hope
that

if

i
thought
it
might

from
the

it
seems
to
get
worse
this
can
be
caused
by
two
one
of
two
things
the
first
and
easiest
to
fix
is
interference
from
something
around
the
monitor
such
as
another
monitor
or
other
electrical
device
try
moving
the
system
to
another
location
to
fix
that
problem
second
because
of
the
scan
rate
of
the
monitor
it
tends
to
synchronize
with
room
lights
and
can
cause
the
interference
you
are
seeing
try
turning
off
all
lights
in
the
rooms
around
the
system
and
see
if
that
helps
if
not
try
moving
the
system
somewhere
else
a
third
solution
would
be
to
get
a
apple
color
display
it
should
not
have
the
same
problem
the
color
is
more
suceptible

i
could
be

if
there
were

i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play
in

if
there
isnt
a

with
our

i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
and
powerbook
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a

if

insert

this

a

could
be
made
that
would
fit
in

but
thats
the
only
place
so
will
it
be
possible
to
have
a
nubus
or
pds
powerpc
upgrade
or
will
it
require
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interesting
for
apple
to
come
out
with
a
nubus
powerpc
that
allowed
use
of
the
cpus
like
rocketshare
but
i
guess
thats
getting
a
bit
fantastic
i
was
wondering
since
macweek
reported
that
developers
were
seeded
with
powerpcs
on
a
nubus
card
also
any
word
on
machine
arrivals
or
estimated
speed
last
i
heard
the
estimates
were
around
times
the
speed
of
a
quadra
in
native
risc
mode
i
heard
an
apple
employee
mumble
something
about
the
arrival
of
powerpc
machines
at
a
much
earlier
date
that
but
i
doubt
its
true
finally
is
the
powerpc
developers
cd
minicourse
available
i
saw
it
advertised
in
the
developers
university
calendar
and
id
like
to
know
if
its
at
all
interesting
sean
seanmcdacdalca
radius
speculated
publicly
that
they
could
provide
a
powerpcbased
rocket
for
existing
macs
it
would
have
the
plus
of
rocketshare
and
the
minus
of
nubus
accelerators
no
true
boot
off
the
accelerator
nubus
bottleneck
to
video
and
other
io
apple
it
seems
will
not
compete
with
third
parties
here
except
perhaps
for
notyetavailable
macs
like
cyclone
where
a
powerpc
slot
might
be
advertised
look
for
daystar
and
such
to
make
powerpc
accelerators
one
potential
problem
with
any
accelerator
though
is
that
it
will
need
a
rom
companion
and
apple
has
licensed
only
radius
with
rocketshare
to
use
any
of
its
proprietary
code
apple
is
between
the
lines
trying
to
let
us
know
that
powerpc
macs
will
have
simplified
logic
boards
due
to
the
magical
nature
of
risc
and
that
these
boards
should
be
much
cheaper
to
build
than
those
in
existing
macs
perhaps
then
well
see
groundbreaking
prices
in
maclogic
board
upgrades
much
the
same
way
weve
seen
much
cheaper
highperformance
cpus
this
year
first
generation
powerpcs
will
also
hopefully
have
socketed
cpus
so
that
theyll
be
chip
upgradeable
to
a
year
later
this
should
be
possible
in
much
the
same
way
that
can
be
pulled
for
clock
doublers
if
there
is
too
much
technical
baggage
which
i
doubt
since
the
external
busses
are
the

sizewidth
to
do
this
perhaps
we
can
have

re
mac
portable
vs
powerbook
answers
regarding
the
post
for
information
about
the
mac
portable
and
the
powerbook
here
are
a
couple
of
the
answers
does
the
mac
portable
support
appletalk
yes
what
cpu
is
in
the
mac
portable
a
low
power
version
of
the
running
at
mhz
does
the
mac
portable
run
system
yes
although
it
does
use
up
a
lot
of
memory
is
memory
still
availabe
for
the
portable
there
are
several
vendors
that
still
make
ram
for
the
portable
there
are
two
options
some
vendors
sell
memory
that
plugs
into
the
ram
slot
inside
the
portable
others
sell
memory
that
plugs
into
the
processor
direct
slot
either
way
the
most
memory
you
can
address
is
either
or
megabytes
depending
on
whether
the
portable
is
backlit
or
not
king
memory
and
peripherials
in
irvine
california
is
the
cheapest
place
i
know
of
for
portable
memory
mb
and
mb
i
still
see
several
ads
in
macuser
that
are
selling
mb
modules
for
wide
variety
in
pricing
here
what
is
the
internal
hd
its
a
conner
mb
hd
with
an
average
access
time
of
about
ms
is
the
screen
better
that
the
pb
heavens
yes
the
pb
is
a
backlit
passive
matrix
screen
which
means
it
fades
out
on
you
if
you
move
your
head
a
few
degrees
left
or
right
the
portable
has
a
backlit
or
nonbacklit
active
matrix
screen
which
i
think
is
a
joy
to
read
other
things
to
consider
where
to
get
the
portable
and
how
much
to
pay
for
it
a
good
supplier
has
been
selectterm
in
mass
they
were
willing
to
sell
a
nonbacklit
portable
with
an
internal
bps
modem
for
about
or
a
mb
backlit
portable
with
an
internal
bps
modem
for
about
the
answer
is
call
around
for
a
good
while
or
youll
pay
too
much
im
still
looking
for
an
internal
fax
modem
for
the
portable
anybody
got
one
they
want

changing

some

told

buffer
size
of
zterm
via
resedit
he
did
not

could
he
or
any

else
please
tell

what
to
do
i
assume
that
the

is

but
i
do
not
know
and
i
have
no
template
for
that
resource
if
you
have
a
tmpl
for
the
correct
resource
i
would
be
grateful
to
receive
it
that
way
i
could
play
around
a
bit
and
maybe
get
my
duo
to
do
something
useful
with
its
serial
port
other
than
appletalk
btw
i
believe
that
when
the
port
stats
says
that
maximum
in
buffer
is
bytes
that
that
means
increasing
the
buffer
will
help
if
you
are
using
hardware
handshaking
i
can
cram
text
data
pretty
fast
into
my
duo
and
can
monitor
that
cts
is
being
lowered
but
the
buffer
never
gets
beyond
out
of
bytes

because
of

it
wont
work
at

we
have

is

only

it

correct
this
is
the

that
the

i
would

and
if
yes
how
many

i
take

this

technically
you
only
need
to
take

leaving
in
the

will
not

you
anything

the

it

i
have
the
quadra
must

this

you
get
to

putting

yup
you
have

its

a

you

i
know
from
what
weve

in

that
all
have

the

why
would
they
be
so
unclear
about
this

in
their

i
think
this
is
mostly
the
fault
of
the
people
who
write
up
the
literature
and
price
lists
being
confused
themselves
since
there
are
two
possible
processor
configurations
and
one
of
the
them
doesnt
have
an
fpu
it
does
seem
to
be
an
option
even
though
it
really
isnt
im
planning
to
buy
the
pretty
soon
but
im
now
getting
confused
with
whether
it
comes
with
fpu
or
not
well
then
allow
me
to
end
your
confusion
the
only
come
with
an
in
the
base

if
you
are
not
getting
this
configuration
then
you
are
getting
an
fpu
why
say
optional
if
its
built
in
good
question
i
have
been
wondering
that
since
feb
if
you
get
the
centris
with
cd
configuration
you
are
getting
a
mac
with
a
processor
that
has
builtin
math
coprocessor
support
my
understanding
is
that
the
optional
fpu
refers
to
your
option
of
purchasing
the
centris
without
fpu
or
one
of
the
other
configurations
with
fpu
this
is
possible
but
an
option
is
something
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
request
when
you
want
it
what
apple
has
done
is
given
the
buyer
a
choice
between
configurations
and
not
an
option
apple
does
not
offer
an
upgrade
from
the
nonfpu
system
to
become
an
fpu
system
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
processor
on
the
nonfpu
system
a
can
be
replaced
with
a
supplied
by
another
vendor
this
is
not
unclear
at
all
in
fact
apple
has
included
in
the
roms
of
those
machines
with
code
to
recognize
the
presence
of
the
full
fpu
and
use
it
thereby
making
the
upgrade
as
easy
as
switching
chips
you
pop
the
out
and
pop
in
a
full
apple
did
send
a
memo
out
at
one
point
sating
that
the
centris
which
only
comes
with
a
nonfpu
processor
cannot
be
upgraded
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configurations
of
the
two
chips
apparently
do
not
match
so
you
cannot
swap
one
for
another
again
according
to
apples
memo
they
did
i
think
i
would
doublecheck
this
it
has
been
stated
countless
times
in
this
newsgroup
by
two
of
the
centris
hardware
designers
that
the

the

i

really

people
with
this
whole

i
think
well
be
answering
this
question
for
about
the
next
year
or
so
there
is
no
option
to
get
an
fpu
on
a
what
you
have
is
a
choice
of
cpus
there
is
the
that
does
not
have
an
integrated
fpu
like
the
full
and
is
only
present
in
the
base
model
of
the
appleusa
and
there
is
the
full
which
you
get
when
you
order
anything
other
than
the
base
configuration
therefore
since
you
have
ordered
one
of
the
versions
with
onboard
ethernet
models
you
will
not
be
getting
the
but
even
if
you
wanted
to
have
the

wouldnt
be
able
to
order
a

an
its
not
an

also
a
note
to
people
out
there
that
have
and
thinking
that
there
is
an
optional
fpu
the
class
chip
cannot
recognize
an
external
fpu
so
there
is
no
socket
on
the
motherboard
for
a
fpu
chip
and
you
cannot
go
out
and
purchase
an
fpu
on
a
pds
card
or
something
like
that
the
only
way
to
get
an
fpu
in
these
machines
is
to
replace
the
with
a
full

if
you
have
a

will
not

hi
i
am
working
on
a
project
for
my
marketing
class
and
id
like
to
ask
your
help
the
assignment
is
to
come
up
with
a
product
and
create
a
marketing
plan
for
it
technical
issues
are
not
terribly
important
at
this
point
well
my
groups
plan
is
to
market
a
full
page
monitor
for
laptop
computers
it
would
be
a
thirdparty
product
to
be
installed
by
authorized
repair
centers
like
newer
technologys
palettebook
screen
the
idea
is
that
the
screen
would
fold
in
such
a
way
that
you
would
get
twice
the
screen
height
of
a
normal
screen
remember
technical
issues
aside
in
fact
by
adjusting
the
fold
of
the
screen
and
the
monitor
configuration
you
could
have
regular
or
full
height
the
screen
would
probably
be
monochrome
the
motivation
behind
this
is
that
laptop
computers
seem
to
be
very
popular
among
business
people
business
people
also
commonly
use
word
processing
and
spreadsheet
applications
for
which
it
is
very
convenient
to
see
a
large
portion
of
the
document
because
of
the
target
users
and
applications
color
screens
arent
really
a
neccessity
we
could
hopefully
keep
the
cost
between
and
now
please
dont
write
this
off
as
completely
ridiculous
i
really
need
some
constructive
feedback
so
if
you
would
please
reply
to
me
via
email
and
let
me
know
if
you
would
consider
buying
a
full
page
laptop
screen
how
much
you
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
any
helpful
commentaries
on
the
idea
also
if
you
take
this
idea
and
make
a
lot
of
money
off

they

all
i

that
the

worked
perfectly
on
both
my

my

it
was
for
this
reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a

from

it
would
start
popping

saying
this

must

formatted

even
though
there
was
no

in

mark
the
problem
mentioned
last
is
a
known
quadra
scsi
problem
it
was
heavily
discussed
last
year
and
an
apple
employee
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
one
byte
error
in
the
scsi
driver
routine
for
the
quadras
at
least
the
and
system
should
not
have
that
problem
for
most
people
the
solution
was
to
get
an
updated
driver
from
the
drive
manufactor
in
my
case
mass
microsystems
wrote
a
new
driver
which
fixed
the
problem
on
my

that
occured

ive
been
looking

used
laserwriters
the
plus
the

the

its
my

that
only
the

has
a

and
ntr
i
have
access
to
the

discount
i
work
for
one
of
apples
spinoffs
so
i
can
get
these
reasonably
cheaply
ive
heard
bad
things
about
the
ls
comments
im
leaning
towards
the
personal
ntr
cause
it
has
a
nice
small
footprint
laserwriter
select
i
hear
it
doesnt
have
postscript
but
i
havent
seen
anything
for
sure
i
heard
mumbles
once
about
a
postscript
upgrade
used
hp
laserjets
ive
worked
with
the
ii
and
iip
on
another
platform
and
they
were
painfully
slow
are
they
that
bad
on
the
mac
ive
seen
ads
for
an
epson
ps
laserprinter
that
is
running
quite
cheap
any
comments
on
this
printer
i
hate
the
styling
too
many
ouput

but
if
its
a

ill

hi
i
think
i
have
a
problem
with
the
stereo
sound
output
on
my
quadra
but
i
am
not
totally
sure
because
my
roomate
has
the
same
problem
on
his
powerbook
any
info
or
experience
anyopne
has
would
be
greatly
appreciated
when
i
hook
my
quadra
up
to
my
home
stereo
system
the
following
types
of
sounds
mono
as
far
as
i
can
tell
all
play
fine
through
both
speakers
system
beeps
already
provided
ones
such
as
indigo
and
ones
i
record
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
but
the
following
games
only
play
out
of
the
left
channel
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
but
still
stereo
system
beeps
do
play
in
stereo
through
both
speakers
the
one
im
specifically
referrring
to
is
apocolyptic
beginning
which
my
roommate
downloaded
from
some
ftp
site
sumex
all
of
the
symptoms
are
the
same
on
my
rommates
he
cant
run
ootw
because
he
doesnt
have
color
were
both
running
system
does
anyone
with
lemmings
or
the
other
three
games
i
mentioned
above
get
sound
out
of
both
speakers
on
a
mac
ii
class
quadra
lc
powerbook
or
greater
centris
etc
stereo
machine
i
used
to
have
a
mac
ii
and
i
sort
of
rememeber
lemmings
playing
in
stereo
on
that
machine
not
just
on
the
left
channel
i
could
be
mistaken
though
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
quad
and
pb
i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play
in
stereo
if
there
isnt
a
problem
with
our
machines
i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
and
powerbook
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a
rom
problem
if
so
though
why
wouldnt
system
patch
over
this
problem

mac
sound
hardware
is
diverse
some
macs
play
in
stereo
and
mix
the
output
the
for
instance
while
others
play
in
stereo
but
only
has
the
left
channel
for
the
speaker
while
some
are
truly
mono
like
the
lc
developers
know
that
stuff
played
in
the
left
channel
is
guaranteed
to
be
heard
while
the
right
channel
isnt
some
send
data
to
both
some
only
send
data
to
the
left
channel
the
first
is
preferrable
of
course
okay
i
guess
its
time
for
a
quick
explanation
of
mac
sound
the
original
documentation
for
the
sound
hardware
documents
how
to
make
sound
by
directly
accessing
hardware
basically
you
jam
values
into
all
the
even
bytes
from
soundbase
to
this
was
because
of
how
the
mac
and
some
later
machines
generated
sound
was
by
scanning
this
block
and
daing
every
even
byte
the
odd
bytes
went
to
the
floppy
on
some
machines
when
the
mac
ii
and
apple
sound
chip
was
invented
it
was
designed
to
generate
stereo
sound
it
was
also
designed
to
be
compatible
with
we
had
once
documented
so
storing
bytes
at
the
even
values
at
soundbase
meant
i
want
to
play
a
mono
sound
and
so
it
was
emulated
but
apple
had
since
retracted
the
documentation
on
soundbase
and
decided
not
to
document
the
lowest
layers
of
sound
generation
so
apple
never
explained
where
to
stuff
bytes
if
you
want
to
make
stereo
sound
enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
furthermore
people
who
port
from
the
ibm
dont
want
to
learn
more
apis
so
it
has
become
popular
for
game
writers
to
write
to
soundbase
to
make
sound
since
it
is
very
easy
since
the
mac
ii
apple
has
had
many
different
kind
of
sound
output
hardware
and
the
only
things
they
have
in
common
are
that
writing
to
soundbase
works
on
some
hardware
mac
ii
iix
iicx
iici
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
through
both
speakers
on
some
macs
quadra
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
on
the
left
channel
only
both
are
technically
correct
interpretations
of
the
original
specification
but
one
is
obviously
preferable
for
asthetic
reasons
if
developers
use
the
sound
manager
and
i
think
the
sound
driver
mono
sounds
will
typically
come
out
through
both
channels
regardless
of
the
underlying
hardware
it
is
possible
to
specify
you
want
to
generate
left
channel
only
but
no
one
does
if
developers
write
to
sound
base
their
games
will
only
come
out
the
left
on
some
games
the
other
problem
the
original
mac
ii
only
producing
left
channel
sound
on
the
internal
speaker
while
the
mixes
both
isnt
really
related
it
is
due
to
the
post
generation
amplification
used
on
the
motherboards
of
the
different
machines
it
only
affects
true
stereo
sounds
sounds
which
are
actually
mono
will
play
on
the
internal
speaker
no
matter
what
machine
you
have
now
to
more
directly
address
the
question
the
games
you
list
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
and
also
hellcats
super
tetris
oxyd
and
many
more
these
are
just
what
ive
tested
cheat
and
write
to
soundbase
and
so
are
only
left
channel
on
quadras
other
games
you
list
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
and
also
pga
tour
golf
civilization
and
more
these
are
again
only
from
personal
experience
use
the
sound
manager
and
work
fine
on
all
machines
the
more
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
really
i
am
absolutely
positively
not
allowed
to
do
what
i
am
about
to
do
but
im
going
say
it
anyway
stop
cheating
on
sound
really
soon
you
will
be
sorry
as
even
those
without
external
speakers
will
be
disappointed
with
your
sound
on
future
hardware
the
grace
period
is
about
to
end
the
sound
manager
is
understandable
now
and
works
pretty
well
and
will
work
even
better
soon
so
use
it
in
conclusion
to
doug
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
at
least
not
a
bug
to
jon
it
isnt
a
choice
to
developers
as
to
whether
they
want
to
send
sound
to
both
channels
if
they
do
it
the
right
way
it
is
taken
care
of
automatically
if
you
cheat
there
is
not
way
to
make
it
work
on
all
hardware

fun

i

straight
is
it
simply
impossible

to
use
the

features
i
believe
you
need

quickdraw
i

this
somewhere

other

its
i
think
you
will
find

can
print
grayscale
images
loaded
with
the
proper
software
however
the
mac

cannot

an

saying

he
had
bought
a

wizzbang
laser

from
apple
a
select
i
think
which
can
print
grayscale
he
then
said
that
he
cannot
print
grayscale
from
his
se
computer
and
also
that
all
the
experts
he
has
dealt
with
agree
that
it
is
not
possible
this
is
the
one
major
bugbear
about
doing
a
party
se
upgrade
compared
to
apples
se
to
upgrade
you
will
never
be
able
to
run
color
quickdraw
it
is
color
quickdraw
that
controls
color
and
grayscale
ses
can
print
some
colour
this
is
because
quickdraw
the
original
noncolour
version
has
the
right
hooks
for
eight
colours
some
of
you
will
remember
the
scsigraph
solution
to
getting
a
colour
screen
for
your

i
think
that
it
gave
you
sixteen
colours
by
dithering
or
something
there
is
no
reason
that
apple
couldnt
release
software
patches
for
older
computers
there
are
lots
of
mac
pluses
classics
and
ses
that
have
been
upgraded
to

processors
which
should
be
perfectly

they
wont

re

also
if
someone
would
recommend
another

id
like
to
hear
about
it
thanks
for
any
time
and
effort
you
expend
on
this
karl
try
looking
at
the
brainstorm
accelerator
for
the
plus
i
believe
it
is
the
best
solution
because
of
the
performance
and
price
why
spend
upgrading
a
computer
that
is
only
worth
the
brainstorm
accelerator
is
around
it
speeds
up
the
internal
clock
speed
to
that
may
not
seem
like
much
but
it
also
speeds
up
scsi
transfers
i
think
that
feature
is
unique

zyxel
has
the
biggest
cult
following
and
can
be

but
i
ignored
it
because
i

something
with

which
will
work
without
any
tweaking
the
att
dataport
earns
nearly
unanimous
praises
for
reliability
they
are
backordered
at
the
moment
probably
because
of
the
special
price
in

until

warning

say
that
the

comes
with
a

kit
cables
all
and
has
lifetime
warranty
this
applies
only
when
you
order
directly
from
paradyne
i
called
elektek
one
of

they
wanted
to

gave
only

usr
sportster
for
the

is

highly

not

from

if
you
are
willing

i
have

to
both
of

first
i
recommend
the

it
is
a
trinitron
vga
monitor
but
it
is
designed
specifically
for
use
with
the

it
works
only
with

with

it

one
from
james

which
is
about
these
cost
about
as
compared
to
the
much
higher
prices
of
comparable
monitors
because
they
are
not
multisynch
i
have
used
one
for

a

it
second

them
to

my

finally
gave

the

this
weekend
after
starting
life
as
a
way
back
in
sooo
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
machine
a
bit
sooner
than
i
intended
to
be
im
looking
into
picking
up
a
powerbook
or
maybe
and
have
a
bunch
of
questions
that
hopefully
somebody
can
answer
does
anybody
know
any
dirt
on

the
next
round
of
powerbook
introductions
are
expected
id
heard
the
was
supposed
to
make
an
appearence
this
summer
but
havent
heard
anymore
on
it

since
i

was

anybody
out
there
had
more
info
has
anybody
heard
rumors

price
drops

line

whats

i
got

rather
than
the

i
dont
really
have
a

for
how
much
better
the
display
is
yea
it
looks
great
in
the
store
but
is
that
all
wow
or
is
it
really
that
good
could
i
solicit
some
opinions
of
people
who
use
the
and
daytoday
on
if
its
worth
taking
the
disk
size
and
money
hit
to
get
the
active
display
i
realize
this
is
a
real
subjective
question
but
ive
only
played
around
with
the
machines
in
a
computer
store
breifly
and
figured
the
opinions
of
somebody
who
actually
uses
the

daily
might
prove

all
the

we
phoned
the

dealer
our
apple
dealer
the

dealer
all
say
its
our
fault
or
they
dont

the

they
said
was
that

i
dont
know
about
the
specific
problem
mentioned
in
your
message
but
i
definitely
had
scsi
problems
between
my
and
my
venerable
jasmine
megadrive
cartridge
drives
my
solution
was
to
get
silverlining
none
of
the
loops
that
involved
blind
writes
worked
to
the
drives
in
fact
the
only
loop
that
worked
was
the
macintosh
software
loop
whatever
that
means
i
doubt
this
is
a
quadraspecific
problem
i
had
to
get
rid
of
my
venerable
bernoulli
last
year
with
enough
cartridges
purchased
at
each
to
make
the
whole
thing
worth
more
than
my
whole
computer
the
tech
support
guys
at
ocean
microsystems
suggested
that
some
thirdparty
drivers
might
fix
the
problem
in
my
case
the
cartridges
wouldnt
formatmountpartition
for
aux
all
i
know
is
that
the
megadrives
worked
perfectly
on
both
my
mac
plus
and
my
powerbook
it
was
for
this
reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a
cartridge
from
a
drive
it
would
start
popping
up
dialog
boxes
saying
this
cartridge
must
be
formatted
with
jasmine
driveware
even
though
there
was
no
cartridge
in
the
drive
mark
i
have
been
using
the
pli
sony
mo
drive
and
now
a
sharp
color
scanner
using
standard
scsi
cables
and
standard
terminator
on
my
no
problems
if
you
were
using
a
iifx
that
might
be
another
story
make
sure
there
is
only
one
terminator
in
the
cabling
and
it
must
be
at
the
end
some
boxes
have
internal
terminators
some
can
be
switched
out
and
others
are
socketted
these
count
if
the
box
with
internal
terminations
cannot
be
put
on
the
end
to
terminate
the
cabling
they
have
to
be
disabled
ie
switched
out
or
pulled
out
of
their
sockets
if
you
have
boxes
with
internal
terminations
the
terminations
in
one
box
has
to
be
disabled
etc
i
am
sure
that
this
has
been
covered
by
the
experts
my
experience
with
scsi
boxes
that
connect
to
the
mac
indicates
that
they
must
have
some
software
package
for
the
mac
to
talk
to
them

driver
i
have
an

i
cannot

i

the

support

maybe
color
on

however
the

still
lists

as
the
highest
possible
does
it
make
any

which

you
put

you
have

someone
mention
about
a

has
anyone
else
heard
anything
about
this
id
be
interested
in
the
cost
per
megabyte
and
the
approximate
cost
of
the
drive
itself
and
how
they
compare
to
the
bernoulli
i
think
you
must
be
talking
about
the
syquest
code
named
mesa
i
believe
it
is
a
winchester
technology
drive
pretty
much
like
the
other
syquest
drives
in
terms
of
how
it
works
according
to
the
latest
macleak
the
drive
has
a
ms
access
time
mbs
sustained
throughput
these
figures
are
from
memory
so
they
could
be
slightly
off
but
they
give
you
an
idea
of
performance
nonetheless
the
drive
was
originally
released
for
the
pc
and
just
recently
was
released
for
the
mac
world
dont
ask
me
what
the
differences
are
and
through
they
are
currently
in
limited
supply
according
to
a
syquest
rep
they
are
in
the
process
of
ramping
up
for
mass
production
i
have
already
seen
them
advertised
by
a
number
of
manufacturers
in
macleak
including
pli
massmicro
clubmac
and
macwarehouses
poweruser
the
pli
and
massmicro
units
are
priced
at
just
around
the
lesser
name
brands
are
going
for
around
for
an
external
drive
cartridges
which
hold
mb
sell
for
about
each
at
these
prices
the
drives

are
cheaper
and
better
performing
than
the
drives
cost
per
megabyte
compares
favorably
with
other
cartridge
drives
and
bernoulli
drives
but
for
large
amounts
of
data
optical
is
still
cheaper

mentioned

i
definitely
had

my

was
to
get
silverlining
none

op
that
worked
was

whatever
that

i
doubt
this
is
a
quadraspecific

i
had
to
get
rid

my
venerable
bernoulli
last
year
with
enough
cartridges
purchased
at
each
to
make
the
whole
thing
worth
more
than
my
whole

the
tech
support
guys
at

suggested
that
some
thirdparty

might
fix
the
problem
in
my
case
the
cartridges
wouldnt

hat
the
megadrives
worked
perfectly
on
both
my
mac
plus
and
my
powerbook
it
was
for
this
reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a
cartridge
from
a
drive
it
would
start
popping
up
dialog
boxes
saying
this
cartridge
must
be
formatted
with
jasmine
driveware
even
though
there
was
no
cartridge
in
the
drive
mark
t
to
format
i
have
this
confirmed
from
apple
computer
in
sweden
i
work
for
a
apple
dealer
as
a
service

we
had
problems
that
quadras
wanted
to
format
a
diskette

when
ther
was
nothing

this

could
anyone
with

help
me

going
absolutely
insane
i
wanna
know
if
the
problem
is
my
duo
or
all
duo
or
all

or
just
me
hmmm
sounds
vaguely
similar
to
a
problem
i
had
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
trying
to
use
kermit
i
was
building
a
serial
connection
between
my
duo
and
my
next
i
think
the
problem
was
in
the
handshaking
basically
you
need
to
make
sure
that
the
handshaking
protocol
is
the
same
on
both
sides
a
safe
place
to
start
is
by
selecting
no
handshaking
on
either
end
one
problem
is
that
the
zilog
serial
chip
seems
to
get
permanently
wedged
if
you
talk
to
it
wrong
and
only
a
reset
will
clear
it
i
dont
know
the
specifics
but
this
could
be
a
nonlinearity
that
screws
up
your
attempts
at
debugging
the
system
it
could
very
well
be
that
you
are
doing
things
righteventually
but
one
wrong
move
like
trying
a
bad
handshaking
protocol
can
screw
up
any
further
correct
actions
until
the
next
machine
reset
i
have
wedged
my
mac
and
also
my
next
that
way
now
i
can
send
files
back
and
forth
between
the
duo
and
the
next
without
any
problem
and
at
pretty
high
speeds
too
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
chip
the
pc
uses
but
i
think
the
zilog
is
pretty
standard

this

re
quadra
scsi
problems
attention
mac
quadra
owners
many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
an
example
would
be
a
sony
inch
mo
without
the
special
maccompatible
firmware
installed
one
solution
sometimes
is
to
disable
blind
writes
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
arent
any
problems
with
quadras
and
blind
transfers
trouble
with
blind
transfers
usually
means
the
programmer
screwed
up
the
tibs
or
didnt
test
their
driver
with
the
device
in
question
well
designed
tibs
poll
or
loop
at
every
point
where
delays
of
occur
this
usually
occurs
at
the
first
byte
of
each
block
of
a
transfer
but
some
devices
can
hiccup
in
the
middle
of
blocks
if
this
happens
in
the
middle
of
a
blind
transfer
there
is
the
possibility
of
losing
or
gaining
a
byte
depending
on
which
direction
the
tranfer
was
going
in
anycase
the
scsi
manager
will
eventually
return
a
phase
error
at
the
end
of
the
transaction
because
it
is
out
of
sync
actual
data
loss
would
only
occur
if
the
driver
didnt
pay
attention
to
the
errors
coming
back
note
that
this
effect
is
not
caused
by
anything
actually
on
the
scsi
bus
but
rather
by
the
transfer
loops
inside
the
scsi
manager
the
problem
occurs
when
the
processor
bus
errors
trying
to
access
the
scsi
chip
when
the
next
byte
hasnt
been
clocked
yet
also
note
that
the
bus
error
is
dealt
with
by
a

hi
there
what

your

for
a

i
would

maybe
for

too

i

not

i

allowing

enter

the

are
inconveniently
lame
for

the

is
pretty
ok
since
its
fast
sound
manager
used

the

is
useless
disposing
of

channels
as
soon
as

has
completed
is
out
of
the

for

its

the

is
so
much
snappier
than
sound
manager
unfortunately
system
supports
it
poorly

crash
occasionally
the
more
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
really
i
am
absolutely
positively
not
allowed
to
do
what
i
am
about
to
do
but
im
going
say
it
anyway
stop
cheating
on
sound
really
soon
you
will
be
sorry
as
even
those
without
external
speakers
will
be
disappointed
with
your
sound
on
future
hardware
the
grace
period
is
about
to
end
the
sound
manager
is
understandable
now
and
works
pretty
well
and
will
work
even
better
soon
so
use
it
well
i
want
my
code
to
work
on
old
systems
too
i
dont
know
about
sys
but
at
least
on
there
are
bugs
in
the
sound
manager
that
causes
channels
to
hang
with
no
error
message
this
happends
when
i
keep
a
channel
open
for
long
periods
necessary
for
performance
and
play
many
sounds
stopping
sounds
halfway
callbacks
seems
not
to
be
reliable
then
only
way
i
can
safely
tell
if
a
sound
has
stopped
playing
is
to
inspect
private
variables
in
the
channel
qhead
i
think
it
was
and
the
only
way
i
have
found
to
tell
if
a
channel
is
hung
is
to
inspect
an
undocumented
flag
and
modify
it
am
i
happy
with
this
nope
i
consider
writing
to

simply
to

its

how

i

i

can

row
i
assume
that
was
done
when

were

so
my

is
are
there
any

that

any

we
bought
one
from
relax
technologies
big
mistake
the
drive
had
some
jumpers
set
incorrectly
so
it
didnt
work
at
first
and
the
software
they
shipped
with
it
was
incompatable
with
the
drive
it
was
the
new
compression
model
and
worst
of
all
when
i
opened
the
drive
up
to
fiddle
with
the
jumpers
i
found
the
inside
of
the
case
covered
with
metal
filings
sorry
to
shout
apparently
when
they
drilled
the
mounting
holes
in
the
case
they
forgot
to
clean
it
before
putting
the
drive
in
this
was
a
hp
drive
by
the
way
and
is
now
working
fine
knock
on
wood
no
thanks
to
relax
technologies
i
have
found
that
you
should
observe
the
following
with
almost
all
new
equipment
check
for
warrany
tape
if
none
carefully
open
unit
inspect
for
loose
wires
jumpers
screws
and
other
trash
clean
up
these
manufacturing
mistakes
now
power
up
the
unit
and
check
it
out
i

usenet
is
a

basic
questions
how
do
i
lock
a
floppy
disk
to
queries
that
would
make

himself
run
screaming
from

in
terror
i
used
resedit
to
remove
resources
init
wdef
and
nvir
from
my
system
file
and
used
the
hex
editor
to
add
code
string
as
a
patch
to
the
sfgetfile
routine
so
the
standard

dialog
box
would
be
a
nice
shade

worked
fine

installed
supercdevblaster

the
proper
newsgroup
will
fill
your
mailbox
with
pearls
of
wisdom
and
maybe
a
few
rotten
oysters
too
posting
to
the
wrong
newsgroup
often
engenders
a
thundering
silence
for
instance
the
most
common
and
glaring
mispost
one
that
seems
as
incongruous
to
dwellers
in
the
macintosh
regions
of
usenet
as
would
a
purple
elephant
to
aleuts
in
the
arctic
asking
a
question
about
networking
anywhere
except
compsysmaccomm
normally
produces
no
useful
responses
posting
the
same
question
to
compsysmaccomm
ensures
that
your
post
is
read
and
considered
by
dozens
of
experienced
network
administrators
and
not
a
few
network
software
designers
please
post
to
exactly
one
newsgroup
do
not
crosspost
if
a
question
isnt
important
enough
for
you
to
take
the
extra
minute
to
figure
out
where
it
properly
belongs
its
not
important
enough
for
several
thousand
people
to
spend
their
time
reading
for
the
same
reason
compsysmacmisc
should
not
be
used
as
a
catchall
newsgroup
the
breakdown
of
questions
between
different
newsgroups
in
this
document
can
also
serve
as
a
reasonable
guide
to
what
belongs
where
specifically
questions
about
productivity
applications
software
you
bought
your
macintosh
to
run
not
software
you
bought
to
make
your
macintosh
run
better
should
go
to
compsysmacapps
unless
the
application
is
covered
in
a
more
specific
newsgroup
communications
programs
games
hypercard
compilers
and
databases
all
have
more
topical
compsysmac
newsgroups
post
questions
about
noncommunications
hardware
including
questions
about
what
software
is
necessary
to
make
particular
hardware
work
to
compsysmachardware
questions
about
macos
system
software
belong
in
compsysmacsystem
questions
about
utilities
and
extensions
normally
belong
in
compsysmacmisc
questions
about
aux
go
to
compunixaux
detailed
questions
about
appletalk
belong
in
compprotocolsappletalk
direct
questions
about
hypercard
to
compsysmachypercard
nonhypercard
programming
questions
and
questions
about
development
environments
should
go
to
compsysmacprogrammer
resedit
questions
may
be
posted
either
to
compsysmacmisc
compsysmacsystem
or
compsysmacprogrammer
but
generally
the
netters
who
inhabit
the
darker
recesses
of
compsysmacprogrammer
are
considerably
more
practiced
at
the
art
of
resource
hacking
a
general
exception
to
the
above
rules
is
that
any
very
technical
question
about
an
application
that
actually
begins
to
delve
into
the
hows
of
a
program
as
well
as
the
whats
recent
example
how
does
writenow
which
is
written
entirely
in
assembly
compare
to
other
word
processors
written
in
high
level
languages
might
be
better
addressed
to
the
programmer
newsgroup
for
sale
and
want
to
buy
posts
should
go
to
compsysmacwanted
and
miscforsalecomputersmac
only
we
understand
that
youre
desperate
to
sell
your
upgraded
mac
to
get
the
for
a
powerbook
but
trust
me
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
it
will
be
reading
compsysmacwanted
political
and
religious
questions
the
mac
is
better
than
windows
is
not
is
too
is

hey
how
bout
the
amiga
what
about
it
is
not
is
too
belong
in
compsysmacadvocacy
anything
not
specifically
mentioned
above
probably
belongs
in
compsysmacmisc
finally
dont
be
so
provincial
as
to
consider
only
the
compsysmac
newsgroups
the
appropriate
forums
for
your
questions
many
questions
about
modems
in
compsysmaccomm
are
much
more
thoroughly
discussed
in
compdcommodems
questions
about

are
often
better
handled
in

even
though
its
not
a

someone
just
asked

shouldnt
i
put
my

by

no
frequent

are
just
as
boring

uninteresting
as
frequent

unless
you
really
have
something
new
to

the

notes
on

stuffit
is
a
family
of
products
that
use
several
different
compression
schemes
the
freeware
stuffit
expander
will
unstuff
all
of
them
versions
of
stuffit
earlier
than
stuffit
stuffit
classic
unstuffit
and
stuffit
deluxe
and
will
not
unstuff
the
increasing
number
of
files
stuffed
by
stuffit
you
need
to
get
a
more
recent
version
of
stuffit
or
stuffit
expander
stuffit
lite
and
deluxe
consistently
makes
smaller
archives
than
any
other
macintosh
compression
utility
to
allow
maximum
space
for
files
on
the
various
ftp
sites
and
to
keep
netbandwidth
down
please
compress
all
files
you
send
to
anonymous
ftp
sites
with
stuffit
uutool
maccompress
and
suntar
handle
the
popular
unix
formats
of
uuencode
uu
compress
z
and
tar
tar
respectively
the
unix
versions
are
often
more
robust
than
the
mac
products
so
use
them
instead
when
thats
an
option
translators
that
allow
stuffit

to
expand
uuencoded
and
tar
files
are
also
available
by

macutil
is
dik
winters
package
of
unix
utilities
to
decompress
and
debinhex
files
on
a
workstation
before
downloading
them
to
a
mac
since
unix
stores
files
differently
than
does
the
mac
macutil
creates
macbinary
bin
files
which
should
be
automatically
converted
on
download
it
cant
decompress
everything
in
particular
it
cant
decompress
the
new
stuffit
archives
however
if
you
need
only
one
or
two
files
out
of
an
archivefor
instance
if
you
want
to
read
the

to

a

you

a
few
notes
on
the
compression
formats
bin
these
are
macbinary
files
always
use
a
binary
file
transfer
protocol
when
transferring
them
never
ascii
or
text
most
files
on
the
net
are
stored
as
hqx
instead
only
rascal
stores
most
of
its
files
in
bin
format
most
communications
programs
such
as
zterm
and
mackermit
are
capable
of
translating
macbinary
files
on
the
fly
as
they
download
if
they
know
in
advance
theyll
be
downloading
macbinary
files
image
this
format
is
normally
used
only
for
system
software
so
that
online
users
can
download
files
that
can
easily
be
converted
into
exact
copies
of
the
installer
floppies
instead
of
using
diskcopy
to
restore
the
images
to
floppies
you
can
use
steve
christensens
freeware
utility
mountimage
to
treat
the
images
on
your
hard
disk
as
actual
floppies
inserted
in
a
floppy
drive
mountimage
has
a
reputation
for
being
buggy
so
you
should
have
some
blank
floppies
and
a
copy
of
diskcopy
handy
just
in
case
sea
x
x
sea
files
dont
merit
a
position
in
the
above
table
because
theyre
selfextracting
they
may
have
been
created
with
compact
pro
stuffit
or
even
diskdoubler
but
all
should
be
capable
of
decompressing
themselves
when
doubleclicked
for
some
unknown
reason
alysis
has
chosen
not
to
use
this
industry
standard
designation
for
selfextracting
archives
created
with
their
payware
products
superdisk
and
more
disk
space
instead
they
append
either
x
or
x
to
selfextracting

how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
get
these
programs
is
to
ask
a
human
being
to
copy
them
onto
a
floppy
for
you
if
youre
at
a
university
theres
absolutely
no
excuse
for
not
finding
someone
to
give
you
a
copy
and
if
youre
anywhere
less
remote
than
mcmurdo
sound
chances
are
very
good
that
someone
at
a
computer
center
dealership
or
user
group
can
provide
you
with
a
copy
of
stuffit
once
you
have
stuffit
any
version
you
dont
need
binhex
if
youre
such
a
computer
geek
that
the
thought
of
actually
asking
a
living
breathing
human
being
instead
of
a
computer
terminal
for
something
turns
you
into
a
quivering
mass
of
protoplasmic
jelly
you
can
probably
download
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
from
a
local
bulletin
board
system
if
you
have
religious
objections
to
software
gotten
by
any
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
then
i
suppose
ill
mention
that
you
can
in
fact
ftp
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
though
this
is
by
far
the
hardest
way
to
get
it
ftp
to
wuarchivewustledu
and
login
type
the
word
binary
hit
return
type
cd
mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression
and
hit
return
then
get
and
hit
return
of
course
its
always
possible
that
by
the
time
you
read
this
stuffit
expander
will
have
been
updated
and
the
name
changed
so
if
this
fails
look
for
something
similar
if
youve
ftpd
straight
onto
your
mac
you
should
now
have
a
selfextracting
archive
which
will
produce
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
expander
when
doubleclicked
if
youve
ftpd
to
your
mainframe
or
unix
account
first
you
still
need
to
use
a
modem
program
to
download
it
to
your
mac
just
make
sure
that
the
mac
is
receiving
in
macbinary
mode
and
the
mainframe
is
sending
in
binary
mode
if
you
need
more
details
on
the
last
step
consult
the
faq
list
for
compsysmaccomm
and
the
manuals
for
both
your
mainframe
and
macintosh
telecommunications
software
how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
from
a
pc
you
cant
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
get
an
executable
macintosh
file
from
an
ftp
site
onto
a
pc
and
then
onto
your
mac
without
some
software
obtained
by
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
you
must
beg
borrow
or
steal
the
necessary
software
such
as
binhex
or
stuffit
lite
from
another
person
i
realize
this
may
terrify
those
among
you
who
havent
left
your
parents
basement
since
you
got
an
apple
ii
in
but
eventually
youre
going
to
need
to
link
up
with
some
human
being
other
than
your
mother
though
i
suppose
if
youre
this
much
of
a
nerd
you
could
send
your
mother
out
to
get
it
for
you
while
youre
gathering
your
nerves
for
a
venture
into
the
strange
and
terrifying
world
of
daylight
please
dont
bother
the
net
by
asking
this
question

there
simply

troubleshooting
what
to
do
before
posting
when
things
go
wrong
while
the
various
faq
lists
cover
a
lot
of
specific
problems
there
are
far
more
problems
that
arent
covered
here
these
are
a
few
basic
techniques
you
should
follow
before
asking
for
help
you
should
probably
also
perform
the
tenstep
preventative
maintenance
routine
described
in
section
four
especially
rebuilding
the
desktop
and
resizing
the
system
heap
following
these
steps
may
or
may
not
solve
your
problem
but
it
will
at
least
make
it
easier
for
others
to
recommend
solutions
to
you
identify
the
problem
microsoft
word
is
crashing
doesnt
say
much
what
were
you
doing
when
it
crashed
can
you
repeat
the
actions
that
lead
to
the
crash
the
more
information
you
provide
about
the
actions
preceding
the
crash
the
more
likely
it
is
someone
can
help
you
the
more
precisely
youve
identified
the
problem
and
the
actions
preceding
it
step
the
easier
it
will
be
to
tell
if
the
following
steps
fix
the
problem
for
example
sometimes
quarkxpress
crashes
with
a
coprocessor
not
installed
error
is
not
nearly
as
helpful
as
quarkxpress
crashes
when
i
link
two
text
boxes
on
a
master
page
when
copies
of
those
text
boxes
already
contain
text
the
former
will
leave
you
wondering
whether
the
bug
remains
after
a
given
step
the
latter
lets
you
go
right
to
the
problem
and
see
if
its
still
there
or
not
read
the
read
me
file
many
companies
include
a
list
of
known
incompatibilities
and
bugs
in
their
read
me
files
often
these
arent
documented
in
the
manual
read
any
read

files
to
see
if
any
of
the
problems
sound
familiar
check
for
viruses
run
disinfectant
or
another
antiviral
across
your
disk
virus
infections
are
rarer
than
most
people
think
but
they
do
occur
and
they
do
cause
all
sorts
of
weird
problems
when
they
do
reinstall
the
application
and
all
its
support
files
for
half
a
dozen
reasons
external
magnetic

improperly
written
software
the
alignment
of

planets
a
file
on
a
disk
may
not
contain
the
data
its
supposed
to
contain
this
can
cause
all
types
of
unexplained
unusual
behavior
restoring
from
original
masters
will
normally
fix
this
reinstall
the
system
software
bits
are
even
more
likely
to
get
twiddled
in
the
system
file
than
in
the
application
and
the
effects
can
be
just
as
disastrous
see
question
for
a
detailed
procedure
for
performing
a
clean
reinstall
if
the
problem
continues
to
occur
after
youve
taken
these
steps
chances
are
youve
found
either
a
conflict
between
your
application
and
some
other
software
or
a
genuine
bug
in
the
program
so
its
time
to
isolate
the
problem
you
need
to
find
the
minimal
system
on
which
the
problem
will
assert
itself
here
are
the
basic
steps
of
isolating
the
cause
of
a
system
or
application
crash
a
run
only
one
application
at
a
time
occasionally
applications
do
conflict
with
each
other
if
the
problem
does
not
manifest
itself
without
other
applications
running
simultaneously
you
can
begin
launching
other
applications
until
you
find
the
one
that
causes
the
crash
b
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
multifinder
if
youre
running
system
allot
as
much
memory
to
the
application
as
you
can
afford
sometimes
programs
just
need
more
memory
especially
when
performing
complicated
operations
c
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
virtual
memory
and
addressing
theres
still
an
awful
lot
of
system
hostile
software
out
there
including
some
from
companies
that
really
have
no
excuse
can
you
say
microsoft
word
boys
and
girls
i
knew
you
could
some
of
this
software
only
expresses
its
incompatibilities
when
certain
uncommon
actions
are
taken
d
boot
from
a
virgin
system
floppy
if
the
problem
disappears
you
likely
have
an
init
conflict
you
need
to
progressively
remove
extensions
until
the
problem
vanishes
use
a
little
common
sense
when
choosing
the
first
extensions
to
remove
if
the
problem
occurs
when
you
try
to
open
a
file
remove
any
inits
that
mess
with
the
standard
file
open
procedure
such
as
super
boomerang
first
if
the
problem
remains
after
the
obvious
candidates
have
been
eliminated
either
remove
the
remaining
extensions
one
at
a
time
or
if
you
have
a
lot
of
them
perform
a
binary
search
by
removing
half
of
the
extensions
at
a
time
once
the
problem
disappears
add
half
of
the
most
recently
removed
set
back
continue
until
youve
narrowed
the
conflict
down
to
one
extension
when
you
think
youve
found
the
offending
init
restart
with
only
that
init
enabled
just
to
make
sure
that
it
and
it
alone
is
indeed
causing
the
problem
contact
technical
support
by
now
you
should
have
a
very
good
idea
of
when
where
and
why
the
conflict
occurs
if
a
tech
support
number
is
available
for
the
software
call
it
if
youre
lucky
the
company
will
have
a
work
around
or
fix
available
if
not
perhaps
theyll
at
least
add
the
bug
to
their
database
of
problems
to
be
fixed
in
the
next
release
preventive

you
wouldnt

spend
a
little

youll
find
several
megabytes
worth

you
no

rethink
your

some
macintoshes
attract

like

seriously
consider
whether
you
actually
need
every
extension
in
your
collection
if
you
dont
use
the
functionality
of
an
extension
at
least
every
fifth
time
you
boot
up
youre
probably
better
off
not
storing
it
in
your
system
folder
where
it
only
takes
up
memory
destabilizes
your
system
and
slows
down
every
startup
for
instance
if
you
only
read
pc

once
a
month
theres
no
need
to
keep

rebuild
the
desktop
the
desktop
filedatabase
holds
all
the
information
necessary
to
associate
each
file
with
the
application
that
created
it
it
lets
the
system
know
what
application
should
be
launched
when
you
open
a
given

what

where
depending
on
its

each

has
one
or
more

the

think
of
it
as
a

every
so
often
its
necessary
to
throw
the

out
and
start

its
easier
to
rebuild
the

than
to

the

all
macs
from
the
original
thin

a
small
amount
of
battery
powered
ram
to
hold
certain
settings
that
properly
move
with
the

rather
than
with

all

you

now
reset

to
whatever
you
want
the
one
setting
that
zapping

does
not
erase
is
the
date
and
time
but
since
the
internal
clock
in
the
macintosh
is
notoriously
inaccurate
youll
probably
want
to
take
this
opportunity
to
reset
it
anyway
resize
the
system
heap
even
after
rethinking
their
extensions
as
per
step
two
most
people
still
have
at
least
half
a
row
of
icons
march
across
the
bottom
of
their
screen
every
time
they
restart
all
these
extensions
and
most
applications
too
need
space
in
a
section
of
memory
called
the
system
heap
if
the
system
heap
isnt
big
enough
to
comfortably
accommodate
all
the
programs
that
want
a
piece
of
it
they
all
start
playing
king
of
the
mountain
on
the
system
heap
knocking
each
other
off
to
get
bigger
pieces
for
themselves
and
trying
to
climb
back
on
after
they
get
knocked
off
all
this
fighting
amongst
the
programs
severely
degrades
system
performance
and
almost
inevitably
crashes
the
mac
if
youre
using
system
your
macintosh
will
automatically
resize
the
system
heap
as
necessary
but
if
youre
running
system
its
important
to
set
your
system
heap
size
large
enough
to
manage
all
your
extensions
and
applications
by
default
this
size
is
set
to
way
too
small
for
most
macs
with
any
extensions
at
all
the
system
heap
size
is
stored
in
the
normally
noneditable
boot
blocks
of
every
system
disk
bill
steinbergs
freeware
utility
bootman
not
only
lets
you
resize
your
system
heap
but
even
checks
how
much
memory
your
heap
is
already
using
so
it
can
tell
how
much
needs
to
be
allocated
if
youre
running
system
get

use
it
and
be
amazed
at
how
infrequently
your
macintosh
crashes
reinstall
the
system
software
system
files
can
become
corrupt
and
fragmented
especially
if
youve
stored
lots
of
fonts
and
desk
accessories
inside
them
merely
updating
the
system
software
will
often
not
fix
system
file
corruption
i
recommend
doing
a
clean
reinstall
heres
how
boot
from
the
installer
floppy
of
your
system
disks
copy
any
nonstandard
fonts
and
desk

out
of

also
trash
the
finder
multifinder
da
handler
and
all
other
standard
apple
extensions
like
control
panel
and
chooser
these
will
all
be
replaced
in

move
everything
in

into
the
top

of
the

rename
the

any
name
other
than
system

is
fine
doubleclick
the
installer
script
on
your
system
disk
then
choose
customize
select
the
appropriate
software
for
your
model
mac
and
printer
you
could
do
an
easy
install
instead
but
that
will
only
add
a
lot
of
extensions
and
code
you
dont
need
that
waste
your
memory
and
disk
space
once
installation
is
finished
move
everything
from
the
temporary
folder
you
created
in
step
into
the
new
system
folder
if
youre
asked
if
you
want
to
replace
anything
you
forgot
to
take
something
out
in
step
youll
need
to
replace
things
individually
until
you
find
the
duplicate
piece
reinstall
any
fonts
or
das
you
removed
in
step
reboot
you
should
now
have
a
clean
defragmented
system
file
that
takes
up
less
memory
and
disk
space
and
a
much
more
stable
system
overall
disk
utilities
much
like
system
files
hard
disks
have
data
structures
that
occasionally
become
corrupted
affecting
performance
and
even
causing
data
loss
apple
includes
disk
first
aid
a
simple
utility
for
detecting
and
repairing
hard
disk
problems
with
its
system
disks
its
also
available
for
anonymous
ftp
from
ftpapplecom
in
the
directory
dtsmacsyssofthdsc
even
if
you
have
an
earlier
version
you
should
get
the
latest
version
from
ftpapplecom
and
run
it
on
all
your
hard
disks
several
companies
have
released
payware
disk
utilities
that
detect
and
repair
considerably
more
problems
than
disk
first
aid
though
interestingly
none
of
them
detect
and
repair
everything
that
disk
first
aid
does
the
three
most
effective
for
general
work
are
central
points
mactools
deluxe
fifth
generations
public
utilites
and
symantecs
norton
utilities
for
the
macintosh
a
department
or
work
group
should
have
all
of
these
as
well
as
disk
first
aid
since
none
of
them
fix
everything
the
others
do
for
individuals
mactools
street
is
about
half
the
price
of
norton
street
or
public
utilities
street
so
features
and
ease
of
use
being
roughly
equal
i
recommend
mactools
all
of
these
products
occasionally
encounter
problems
they
cant
fix
when
that
happens
its
time
to
backup
and
reformat
backing
up
this
is
one
part
of
preventative
maintenance
that
should
be
done
a
lot
more
often
than
every
three
months
the
simplest
back
up
is
to
merely
copy
all
the
files
on
your
hard
disk
onto
floppies
or
other
removable
media
if
you
keep
your
data
files
separate
from
your
application
and
support
files
then
its
easy
to
only
back
up
those
folders
which
change
frequently
nonetheless
every
three
months
you
should
do
a
complete
backup
of
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
programs
are
available
to
make
backing
up
easier
apple
included
a
very
basic
full
backup
application
with
system
with
the
performas
apple
ships
a
new
apple
backup
utility
that
can
backup
the
entire
disk
or
just
the
system
folder
onto
floppies
the
previously
mentioned
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mactools
deluxe
include
more
powerful
floppy
backup
utilities
that
incorporate
compression
and
incremental
backups
finally
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
tape
drive
network
server
or
removable
media
device
to
use
for
backups
you
should
check
out
the
more
powerful
payware
utilities
redux
street
doesnt
support
tape
drives
and
diskfit
pro
street
there
are
no
freely
available
backup
utilities
other
than
the
old
hd
backup
from
system
disk
defragmentation
as
disks
fill
up
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
find
enough
free
space
in
the
same
place
to
write
large
files
therefore
the
operating
system
will
often
split
larger
files
into
pieces
to
be
stored
in
different
places
on
your
hard
disk
as
files
become
more
and
more
fragmented
performance
can
degrade
there
are
several
ways
to
defragment
a
hard
disk
the
most
tedious
but
cheapest
method
is
to
backup
all
your
files
erase
the
hard
disk
and
you
might
as
well
reformat
while
youre
at
it
see
question
and
restore
all
the
files
a
number
of
payware
utilities
including
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mac
tools
deluxe
can
defragment
a
disk
in
place
ie
without
erasing
it
although
the
ads
for
all
these
products
brag
about
their
safety
once
youve
bought
the
software
and
opened
the
shrinkwrap
they
all
warn
you
to
back
up
your
disk
before
defragmenting
it
in
case
something
does
go
wrong
there
are
no
freeware
or
shareware
disk
defragmenters
so
please
dont
annoy
the
net
by
asking
for
one
reformat
your
hard
disk
just
as
a
floppy
disk
needs
to
be
initialized
before
use
so
a
hard
disk
must
be
formatted

when

theres
no

at

not
to
reclaim
whatever
unused
space
apples
left
on
your
disk
unlike
floppies
hard

need
a
special
program
to
initialize
them
most
hard
disks
come
with
formatting
software
apples
disks
and
system
software
ship
with
hd
sc
setup
a
minimal
disk
formatter
which
will
format
apple
brand
hard
drives
only
most
other
manufacturers
ship
appropriate
formatting
software
with
their
hard
drives
normally
this
will
be
all
you
need
to
reformat
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
generalpurpose
formatters
are
also
available
which
go
beyond
the
bundled
software
to
include
features
like
encryption
password
protection
multiple
partitioning
faster
disk
access
system
compatibility
and
even

two
of
the
best
are
the
payware
and

toolkit
personal
edition
street
for
either
while
there
are
one
or
two
freeware
formatters
available
none
are
likely
to
be
superior
to
the
ones
bundled
with
your
hard
disk
powerbook
users
should
be
sure
to
turn
off
sleep
and
processor
cycling
before
reformatting
their
hard
drives
no
matter
what
software
they
use
otherwise
disk
corruption
crashes
and
data
losses
are
a
very
good
possibility

monitor
jitter
several
weeks
ago
i
described
a
problem
with
my
apple
highresolution
monitor
and
promised
to
summarize
replies
received
by
email
to
recapitulate
occasionally
every
two
or
three
hours
or
so
my
monitor
momentarily
loses
sync
the
entire
raster
image
bounces
down
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
or
so
then
rights
itself
this
usually
happens
right
after
i
close
a
large
window
highlight
a
large
area
or
do
something
that
radically
alters
the
image
on
the
screen
sometimes
though
it
happens
with
no
provocation
whatsoever
i
have
received
a
bewildering
range
of
replies
at
one
extreme
was
a
man
clearly
quite
knowledgable
about
monitors
who
said
that
the
problem
was
that
the
monitors
power
supply
simply
couldnt
always
keep
up
with
sudden
changes
of
the
raster
image
the
rapid
change
from
a
largely
light
screen
to
a
largely
dark
one
overtaxed
the
monitors
power
supply
there
was
no
fix
available
he
said
because
nothing
was
really
wrong
i
guess
he
meant
that
the
flaw
was
so
fundamental
that
it
had
to
be
endured
this
seemed
quite
persuasive
and
i
would
have
been
tempted
to
adopt
an
attitude
of
stoicism
except
for
a
reply
from
a
monitor
owner
who
discovered
that
this
very
problem
is
documented
in
the
apple
service
technical
procedures
volume
under
the
heading
jitter
correction
the
section
describes
a
fix
involving
the
replacement
of
a
capacitor
the
adjustment
of
a
potentiometer
or
failing
that
the
swap
of
a

atari
st
simply
blow
the
mac
out
of
the
water
in
terms
of
performance
at
this
time
i
would
in
general
say
that
the
other
advantages
of
the
mac
outweigh
the
advantages
of
the
amiga
or
the
st
and
falcon
but
i
really
wish
apple
would
get
their
heads
together
on
speed
they
could
take
a
real
lesson
in
mulitasking
from
the
amiga
os
or
the
multitos
in
the
atari
falcons
too
im
still
happy
with
my
ci
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
performance
is
so
bad
comparatively
they
could
have
done
multitasking
properly
they
could
have
done
everthing
else
better
but
apple
didnt
of
course
dos
and
windows
are
nothin
to
write
home
about
either
i
just
hope
that
someone
comes
out
with
a
machine
that
does
everything
well
someday
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
go
with
mac
in
most
aspects
but
add
the
speed
and
superior
multitasking
of
the
other
platforms
as
for
the
original
topic
trying
to
compare
just
the
chip

seems
almost
worthless

the

enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
the
sound
driver
is
pretty
ok
since
its
fast
sound
manager
used
by
the
book
is
useless
disposing
of
sound
channels
as
soon
as
sound
has
completed
is
out
of
the
question
for
games
with
smooth
animation
its
too
slow
why
would
you
dispose
a
channel
if
you
are
going
to
play
more
sounds
soon
if
you
are
trying
to
write
a
game
you
shouldnt
be
using
sndplay
instead
make
a
channel
and
use
buffercmds
to
play
sounds
on
it
it
works
great
you
can
add
callbacks
to
the
channel
also
to
let
you
know
when
the
channel
is
getting
empty
before
it
gets
empty
the
sound
driver
is
so
much
snappier
than
sound
manager
unfortunately
system
supports
it
poorly
making
programs
crash
occasionally
the
moral
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
well
i
want
my
code
to
work
on
old
systems
too
i
dont
know
about
sys
but
at
least
on
there
are
bugs
in
the
sound
manager
that
causes
channels
to
hang
with
no
error
message
this
happends
when
i
keep
a
channel
open
for
long
periods
necessary
for
performance
and
play
many
sounds
stopping
sounds
halfway
callbacks
seems
not
to
be
reliable
then
only
way
i
can
safely
tell
if
a
sound
has
stopped
playing
is
to
inspect
private
variables
in
the
channel
qhead
i
think
it
was
and
the
only
way
i
have
found
to
tell
if
a
channel
is
hung
is
to
inspect
an
undocumented
flag
and
modify
it
callbacks
are
very
reliable
i
found
them
reliable
even
under
system
i
was
doing
continuous
background
sound
with
interrupting
sound
effects
on
system
with
the
imv
documentation
you
probably
were
cancelling
your
callback
commands
out
of
your
channels
of
course
you
didnt
get
called
in
general
if
you
have
problems
with
sounds
working
when
you
play
one
per
channel
and
then
close
the
channel
with
the
related
slowdown
but
then
when
you
play
more
than
one
you
dont
work
then
you
are
adding
more
than
one
synthesizer
to
a
channel
possibly
the
same
one
multiple
times
this
might
be
because
you
are
calling
sndplay
on
a
preexisting
channel
with
a
sound
resource
which
adds
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
the
channel
first
thing
before
it
plays
most
sampled
sounds
have
this
command
at
the
start
of
them
you
need
to
resedit
the
sound
and
remove
that
command
then
when
you
create
your
channel
specify
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
be
the
channels
synth
then
you
can
use
asynch
sndplays
all
you
want
youll
probably
want
to
switch
to
buffercmds
since
you
are
going
to
have
to
use
snddocommand
anyway
to
add
callbacks
now
before
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
i
am
full
of
it
and
the
sound
manager
doesnt
work
for
games
remember
spectre
uses
it
and
it
works
great
if
spectre
can
spare
the
cpu
time
you
can
too
one
little
disclaimer
there
are
some
out
there
who
say
the
sound
manager
in
the
iisi
cant
be
made
to
work
right
im
not
sure
either
way
but
i
know
for
sure
that
you
can
make
your
sounds
work
correctly
on
every
other
machine
using
the

manager

there
has
been
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
the

statement
true
there
is
a
power
surge
at
startup
that
has
the
potential
to
do
damage
but
the
internal
power
supply
is
wellprotected
ive
turned
my
mac
on
and
off
six
or
seven
times
a
day
for
three
years
without
problem
the
monitor
is
the
same
to
leave
it
on
is
to
waste
a
lot
of
electricity
twice
as
much
as
a

possibly
more
turn
it
off
when
youre
not

it
itll
save
you
money
and
the
world
a
few
more
resources
the
problem
with
turing
your
computer
on
and
off
constantly
is
not
due
to
the
power
surge
at
start
up
it
is
due
to
thermal
fatigue
you
turn
on
your
computer
it
heats
up
and
everything
expands
you
turn
it
off
it
cools
off
and
everything
contracts
there
is
a
limited
number
of
cycles
of
this
that
any
component
can
take
before
it
fails
modern
electronics
are
much
more
robust
in
this
respect
than
their
predeccesors
in
fact
portable
computers
are
designed
with
this
in
mind
since
the
sleep
function
that
extends
battery
life
also
greatly
increaces
the
number
of
thermal
cycles
that
occur
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
i
am
not
going
to
use
my
computer
and
this
includes
the
monitor
in
the
next
hours
i
turn
it
off
i
always
dim
the
monitor
when
not
in
use
to
prolong
the
life
of
the
phosphor
i
tend
to
think
that
with
the
pace
of
technical
innovation
in
the
computer
industry
you
should
be
much
less
concerned
with
the
fatigue
life
of
your
equipment
and
more
concerned
with
how

the

generally
what
i

is
leave
my

for

crash

i
turn
my

off

i
also
turn
off
after

is
all
you
need
release
look
at
the
rear

assembly
you
will
see
the
flat
ribbon
scsi
connector
to
the
hard
drive
a
power
cable
and
a
flat
ribbon
cable
leading
to
the
floppy

disconnect
all
these
from
the
motherboard
the
hard
drive
power

has
a
tab
which
must
be
squeezed
to
release
it
unplug
the
drive
activity
led
from
its
clear
plastic
mount
look
down
the
posterior
cylindrical
section
of
the
plastic
tower
a
phillips
head
screw
is
at
the
base
remove
it
taking
care
not
to
drop
it
into
the
case
a
bit
of
gummy
glue
on
your
screwdriver
is
helpful
here
remove
the
tower
assembly
by
pulling
medially
the
plastic
tab
on
the
right
side
of
the
tower
this
tab
prevents
the
tower
from
sliding
posteriorly
slide
the
entire
tower
assembly
cm
posteriorly
then
lift
the
tower
assembly
straight
up
and
out
of
the
case
remove
the
interrupt
switch
assembly
it
is
a
strangely
shaped
plastic
device
at
the
left
front
edge
of
the
motherboard
pull
the
middle
rear
plastic
prong
up
and
forward
the
entire
device
will
release
unplug
the
speaker
cable
squeeze
the
plastic
tab
on
the
speaker
to
free
it
then
swing
it
backwards
to
free
it
from
the
case
remove
the
motherboard
form
the
case
lift
the
front
right
corner
of
the
motherboard
about
mm
this
allows
it
to
clear
the
clear
plastic
power
light
guide
slide
the
motherboard
forward
about
cm
the
motherboard
then
comes
directly
out
locate
the
mhz
clock
crystal
it
is
a
small
metal
box
near
the
cpu
chip
note
and
remember
its
orientation
the
new
clock
oscillators
must
be
aligned
with
pin
in
the
same
orientation
very
carefully
desolder
and
remove
the
old
clock
oscillator
some
of
the
pins
may
be
bent
over
simply
desolder
then
unbend
them
be
sure
your
desoldering
iron
is
hot
enough
before
heating
the
board
i
used
a
suction
desoldering
iron
to
accomplish
this
task
this
is
not
appropriate
for
a
first
soldering
experience
the
motherboard
is
a
multilayer
design
with
very
fine
traces
easily
damaged
without
proper
care
install
your
socket
or
socket
pins
where
the
old
oscillator
once
was
put
a
mhz
clock
oscillator
into
the
new
socket
you
could
use
the
old
clock
but
it
has
solder
on
its
pins
this
may
come
of
inside
the
socket
and
cause
corrosion
problems
later
i
suggest
using
a
new
mhz
clock
install
your
cooling
fan
system
to
complete
the
modification
reinsert
the
motherboard
and
slide
it
into
place
snap
in
the
interrupt
switch
assembly
and
speaker
to
lock
the
mother
board
firmly
plug
the
speaker
wire
back
into
the
motherboard
reinstall
the
tower
assembly
by
first
placing
the
right
wall
of
the
tower
against
the
right
wall
of
the
case
with
the
tower
assembly
about
cm
posterior
of
its
intended
position
lower
the
tower
assembly
into
place
while
maintaining
contact
with
the
right
wall
of
the
case
once
fully
down
slide
the
tower
assembly
anteriorly
until
it
clicks
into
place
reconnect
the
motherboard
ends
of
the
cables
dontt
forget
the
floppy
drive
cable
replace
the
phillips
head
screw
drop
the
power
supply
straight
down
into
place
until
it
clicks
in
plug
the
hard
drive
activity
light
back
into
its
clear
plastic
mount
reattach
your
cables
and
power
cords
cross
your
fingers
and
turn
on
the
mac
it
should
make
the
usual
power
on
chord
if
it
doesnt
something
is
amiss
immediately
turn
of
the
power
and
recheck
your
handiwork
if
all
is
not
well
you
have
my
sincere
condolences
hopefully
all
will
work
normally
turn
the
machine
back
off
and
replace
the
mhz
clock
oscillator
with
a
faster
one
reboot
and
be
astounded
you
will
need
to
fully
test
the
machine
for
many
hours
before
deciding
a
particular
speed
is
truly
usable
with
my
vso
a
machine
lockup
might
take
hours
of
operation
to
occur
in
the
brief
time
since
modifying
my
clock
oscillator
hours
i
have
not
had
a
single
problem
good
luck
to
all
who
attempt
this
modification
there
is
a
small
but
real
risk
but
you
could
well
reach
quadra
speeds
or
higher
with
less
than
in
parts

the

heavily

add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machines
with
a
power
saver
feature
built
in
which
would
reduce
power
consumption
automatically
if
the
machine
is
idle
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
this
is
pretty
standard
in
portable
machines
and
the
same
kinds
of
tricks
could
be
played
spinning
down
disks
turning
off
screens
reducing
clock
speed
etc
the
advantage
of
this
over
just
turning
the
thing
off
would
be
you
dont
have
to
remember
to
do
anything
and
the
machine
is
still
available
over
the
network
the
tricky
part
might
be
in
defining
what
constitutes
inactivity
certainly
you
dont
want
to
wake
up
from
sleep
mode
just
because
somebody
pinged
you
but
you
do
want
to
wake
up
at
least
the
cpu
if
somebody
logs
in
via
a
telnet
connection
i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
about
wasting
electricity
in
the
winter
months
that
energy
is
just
getting
turned
into
heat
it
may
not
be
as
efficient
a
way
to
heat
a
building
as
the
central
heating
plant
but
its
not
too
bad
in
the
summer
though
its
a
disaster
not
only
are
you
wasting
that
power
but
youre
probably
also
running

get
rid

what
i
do
is
keep

turn
my

off
when

i
do
this
as
much
for
easing

as
anything
though
turning
off
the
monitor
when
not
in
use
has
the
advantage
of
requiring
less
ram
than
a

but
it
requires
more

re

should

be

i
wonder
how
hard
it
would
be
ie
what
it
would
add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machines
with
a
power
saver
feature
built
in
which
would
reduce
power
consumption
automatically
if
the
machine
is
idle
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
i
believe
that
apple
sun
and
a
number
of
other
desktop
machine
manufacturers
have
agreed
with
the
government
to
incorporate
powersaving
techniques
this
is
also
something
that
governments
in
other
countries
are
likely
to
require
in
the
future
so
expect
to
see
it
this
may
include
the
ability
for
the
system
to
fully
power
down
the
monitor
via
a
controllable
power
outlet
and
power
it
back
on
automatically
is
this
a
sell
on
screen
saver
software
companies
goals
for
idle
power
consumption
have
been
set
at
something
like
watts
for
the
system
not
including
the
monitor
dont
quote
me
on
this
note
that
in
many
businesses
the
savings
will
be
substantial
especially
if
you
factor
in
reduced
load
on
air
conditioning
systems
sun
did
a
study
that
indicated
that
simply
powering
off
monitors
for
the
night
would
save
the
company
sun
itself
on
the
order
of
per
year
putting
other
and
automatic
powersaving
features
in
would
probably
have
greater
than
double
that
value
given
that
we
are
seeing
more
and
more
reason
to
leave
our
work
and
home
computers
on
getting
faxes
automatically
getting
email
building
power
consumption
control
into
all
machines
has
a
potential
to
cut
off
the
national
power
consumption
based
on
data
i
heard
btw
when
encouraging
employees
to
power
off
monitors
when
leaving
work
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
should
only
be
done
with
monitors
with
the
power
switch
on
front
there
was
some
indication
that
monitors
with
power
switches
on
the
rear
are
not
designed
to
tolerate
lots
of
power
cycling
this
may
only
apply
to
the
monitors
we
use
but
might
be
worth
checking
if
you
happen
to
have
a
monitor
with
the
switch
in
back

you

is
there
any

a

fixes
this
it
seems
to
me
that
hp

that
its

restarted
reloaded

i
was
able

put

a

these
fixes
i
guess
he
is
right
early
versions
of
the
rasterops
cards
did
not
either
but
they
fixed
it
and
people
with
problems
can
get
a
free
rom
upgrade
from
rasterops
but
when
pressing
the
shift
key
while
booting
when
the
ext
monitor
goes
black
after
having
been
grey
the
system
sometimes
boots
properly
and
then
works
ok
with
the
and
full
graphics
whats
happening
very
easy
if
you
boot
without
the
control
panel
then
it
will
disable
or
rather
not
reinstall
the
clean
patches
so
when
you
run
ok
you
must
be
in
adressing
mode
check
about
this
macintosh
and
see
if
you
havce
a
system

good
aps
experience
i
just
thought
i
would
pass
along
my
experience
with
aps
i
recently
ordered
an
external
quantum
the
salesperson
was
friendly
and
knowledgeable
the
order
came
when
promised
and
the
invoice
was
at
the
price
quoted
installing
the
drive
was
simple
i
didnt
even
have
to
read
the
manual
the
scsi
address
is
set
by
a

i
daisychained
the
drive
from
my

also
from
aps
and
booted
up
with
no
problems
im
still
going
through
all
the
shareware
that
comes
on
the
drive
its
a
pretty
good
assortment
the
drivefan
is
a
bit
noisier
than
i
would
like
but
i
think
itll
be
ok
the
speed
seems
very
good
although
i
havent
run
any
objective
tests
it
also
seems
to
spin
up
pretty
quickly
i
can
hit
the
power
switch
for
it
and
almost
immediately
power
the
mac
without
any
problems
booting
from
the
drive
some
observations
the
case
is
plastic
good
quality
though
while
my
older
syquest
case
is
metal
there
is
one
led
which
is
normally
green
and
flickers
red

can
hook
up
the

cord
of
an
apple
monitor
to
the
back
of
a
machine
such
as
my
quadra
however
for
my
fathers
there
is
no
extra
plug
which
allows
use
of
the
power
supply
he
needs
to
plug
it
into
the
socket
separately
sodoes
the
monitor
come
with
a
cable
that
will
allow
him
to
do
this
will
have
to
buy
a
different
cable
if
yes
where
can
he
purchase
such
a
cable
or

kind
enough
to
provide
both
types
of
cables

longshort

the

asked
if
heshe
could
use
any

with

hence
title
the
answer
ot
this
question
is
an
unqualified
yes
you
can
use
any
old
vgasvga
monitor
with
a
centris
you
do
need
an
adaptor
i
use
a
mac
vgaq
from
james
engineering
to
run
between
the
two
machines
the
adaptor
i
have
mentioned
will
convert
a
centris
to
a
three

pin
adaptor
for
your
monitor
now
the
special
interest
disclaimer
the
above
answer
is
correct
for
using
a
vga
monitor
at
resolution
if
your
monitor
will
sync
to
horizontal
the
above
adaptor
will
allow
you
to
choose
resolution
i
prefer
this
on
my
then
you
have
the
question
of
matching
adaptors
and
sync
rates

would
advocate
calling
james

quadra
marginal
video
we
are
having
a
problem
with
a
quadra
that
has
stumped
a
couple
of
techs
sent
to
us
by
the
vendor
as
well
as
us
this
quadra
is
stuffed
with
ram
vram
and
some
large
disk
i
think
what
happens
is
that
after
a
certain
variable
interval
of
time
the
video
circuitry
loses
vertical
sync
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
mac
cpu
is
still
ok
and
the
problem
really
seems
to
lie
with
the
video
circuitry
since
you
can
still
save
your
documents
quit
your
aplpications
even
pull
down
menus
etc
only
the
display
is
scrolling
lik
crazy
so
its
pretty
hard
to
hit
menu
items
we
had
the
original
logic
board
replaced
twice
now
and
the
same
problem
has
been
occurring
on
all
boards
although
the
inteval
between
occurrences
has
varied
the
first
board
had
this
problem
every
about
more
often
if
the
cache
was
turned
off
yes
off
this
is
the
only
symptom
that
is
not
obviously
related
to
the
video
circuitry
after
all
the
cache
is
on
the
cpu
right
the
second
board
had
the
problem
every
about
minutes
we
did
not
keep
it
rather
we
put
the
original
back
the
current
board
we
have
has
this
problem
a
lot
less
often
has
gone
about
a
week
without
doing
it
but
did
it
twice
within
an
hour
yesterday
the
technicians
that
have
come
out
to
try
to
figure
it
out
seemed
pretty
sharp
and
tried
a
number
of
sensible
things
most
of
which
we
had
previously
tried
ourselves
anyway
these
included
swapping
the
ram
swapping
the
vram
swapping
monitors
different
apple
rgb
and
apple
rgb
swapping
cables
disconnecting
hd
and
booting
from
floppy
sacrificing
various
small
mammals
here
are
some
other
facts
when
we
put
a
rasterops
procolor
on
the
nubus
the
problem
is
fixed
it
does
not
occur
with
the
internal
video
or
the
procolor
video
out
the
vendor
cannot
reproduce
the
problem
back
in
their
shop
on
the
boards
that
exhibit
it
in
our
lab
apple
is
said
to
be
getting
a
little
bit
pissed
off
at
shipping
us
boards
that
they
cannot
find
anything
wrong
with
and
getting
them
shipped
back
as
faulty
according
to
us
here
are
some
speculations
i
bet
that
neither
apple
nor
the
vendor
has
tested
these
boards
with
that
much
ram
and
vram
on
them
simultaneaously
which
may
have
something
to
do
with
their
finding
it
hard
to
reproduce
the
problem
though
we
can
reproduce
it
with
just
of
ram
so
this
is
probably
a
red
herring
the
vendors
representative
blames
metal
in
your
walls
claims
that
our
walls
have
metal
in
them
which
interferes
with

macs
operation
we
have
another

the

which
works
like
a
charm
though
its
not

the
exact

please
dont
tell

you

you

provides

theres
another

what

you

its
just
an

as

then
another
thing
to
try
as
a
recovery
measure
is
to
use
something
like
quickkeys
to
change
the
pixel
depth

this
reprograms
some

re
why
the

speeds
differ
in
article
thomasnakrebsmcontentapanaorgau
writes
the
most
likely
explanation
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
a
greater
density
of
information
exists
on
the
larger
capacity
disk
drive
than
the
smaller
one
if
your
running
the
drive
on
a
mac
i
would
recommend
a
shareware
utility
called
timedrive
which
tests
seek
scsi
throughput
and
rotational
speed
this
utility
should
let
you
know
what
the
differences
are
between
the
drives

views
expressed

iconic

larger
drives
tend
to
have
multipule
platters
which
can
allow
adjacent
bits
to
be
read
in
parallel
resulting
in
higher
throughput
they
also
have
higher
spindle
speeds
which
leads
to
both
increased
throughput
and
reduced
seek
times
due
to
reduction
of
rotational
latency

i

the

has
an

it
provides
thin

theres
another

resembels

this

any

given
that
its

will
it
work
with
the

i
think
there
may
be
a
probleme
because
the

has
bit
wide

it
probably
wont
work
with
any

the
ones
i
have
for

ii
are

no
it
wont
work

those

indicate

one

that
can

is
a

no

its
just
that
the

have
both

multisession
means
that
when
you
put

on

cd
after
the
first

the
drive
can
read
and
display
them
double

just
transfer
any
type

excluding
sound
at
around
double
the
speed
which
means
i
seem
to
gain
nothing
compared
with
say
is
not
multisession
capable
this
means
that
you
lose
the
ability
to
add
any
more
pictures
after
the
first
time
must
buy
a
new
cd
finally
since
the
is
not
a
double

it
will
require
twice

long
to

the

there
i
have
a

and
consider

ive
been
told
however
that
the

only
on

with
the
double

is
a
prerequisite
for

capability
which
i
need
which
means
i
seem
to
gain
nothing
compared
with

any
comments
thanx
your
source
is
wrong
the
double
speed
is
still
slow
compared
to
a
typical
hard

the
lc
can
easily
handle
the

of

of
the

even
the

unless
you
get
a

card
you
dont
have
to
have
double
speed
to
use
photocd
its
just
faster
reading

off
of

i
think
that
the
can

only

can

what

you

what
it
sounds

is
that
this

had

formed
an

hes
not
recommending

to
anybody
he
says
to
consider
a

a

why
he
would
recommend
a

over
an
lciii
i
dont
know
but
thats
what
he
said
so
what
does
the

think
did
the

just
get
one
flaky
machine
or
did
apple
send
the
out
the

too
early
is
your
working
just
great
or
is
it
buggy
too
my
centris
is
working
perfectly
there
is
one
problem
that
i
have
noticed
fastback
ii
backup
utility
does
not
work
the
strange
thing
is
that
it
works
with
my
friends
most
of
the
time
however
it
never
works
with
my
machine
i
assume
it
is
some
sort
of
software
problem
and
not
hardware
related

well
nothing
the
performas
are
made
to
be
lowcost
business
solutions
the
have

modems
etc
because
they
have
no
retail
price
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
steeper
discount
on
them
shop
around
as
far
as
the

go
buy

much
cheaper
brett
theres
nothing

hmmm
thats
not
quite
right
the
performa
is
real
darn
close
to
the
iivx
but
a
better
buy
imo
i
also
dont
think
they
are
so
much
a
lowcost
business
solution
but
a
lowcost
home
solution
why
else
bundle
at
ease
among
other
things
hardly
a
business
application
what
do
you
mean
by
no
retail
price
quite
the
contrary
i
think
the
price
is
darn
near
the
same
all
across
the
country
that
again
imo
was
one
of
the
selling
points
of
the
performas

no
haggling
required
kinda

couldnt
have
been
why
i
chose
one
over

was

a

who
went
the

when
did
you
last
hear
that
about
someone

admittedly

line
being
printed
its
almost
like
the
paper
is
advancing
a
smidge
too
far
when
advancing
lines
i
replaced
the
ink
cartridge
thinking
it
might
be
the
problem
but
the
lines
are
still
there
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
problem
whats
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
it
brian
s
davidson
internet
i
had
a
similar
problem
with
my
stylewriter
i
the
original
have
you
tried
cleaning
the
print
heads
with
the
swii
driver
its
and
option
in
the
print
dialog
box
sometimes
i
had
to
do
it
several
times
to
get
the
crud
out
yes
it
wastes
ink
but
it
beats
those
white
annoying
lines
another
idea
is
to
print
a
couple
of
pages
with
just
a
big
black
box
it
can
help
to
get
the
ink
flowing
good
luck

those

indicate
a

failure

some
type
during

one
thing
that
can
cause
the

is
a

that
has
become
a

loose
next
time
you
power
down

check
that

a

macintosh
lab
help
interesting
delema
for
all
those
out
there
my
school
is
discussing
installing
a
mac
lab
of
to
stations
for
our
bio
to
classes
to
do
a
study
with
pig
disections
no
joke
here
is
the
deal
we
can
get
this
grant
to
do
a
study
on
if
it
is
more
feasible
to
do
a
disection
via
the
computer
or
via
the
real
thing
my
problem
is
i
was
somehow
drawn
into
this
project
being
done
by
students
who
want
to
go
mac
but
know
nada
about
them
being
the
man
mac
man
on
campus
guess
who
they
came
to
so
i
wnt
to
know
what
would
probably
be
the
best
hardware
to
fill
the
follwoing
list
right
now
we
are
looking
at
the
and
the
platforms
ok
here
it
goes
we
are
using
cdrom
so
ought
we
go
with
the
internal
apple
cdroms
offered
as
options
in
the
and
vx
or
go
external
it
is
a
matter
of
price
and
reliability
the
second
being
very
important
how
much
ram
i
was
thinking
more
leaning
towards
what
do
you
think
ok
called
apple
educational
discounts
and
they
said
their
keyboard
extended
is
is
it
better
to
go
with
the
apple
and
their
long
time
great
wear
and
tear
record
or
is
there
a
party
extended
keyboard
that
is
just
a
reliable
price
printers
one
color
printer
we
are
presently
leaning
towrds
the
thermal
wax
tektronic
or
probably
the
e
as
we
are
going
to
limit
access
so
we
dont
needed
the
is
networkability
so
what
do
you
think
in
terms
of
color
printers
different
brand
kind
dye
sublimation
ink
jet
price
companies
s
also
we
are
looking
to
get
a
laser
printer
or
such
to
network
into
the
whole
lab
for
noraml
printing
the
fornt
runner
is
the
apple
is
that
right
dont
have
my
notes
here
at
suggestions
we
have
kids
using
these
things
all
day
if
this
lab
goes
through
and
they
know
nothing
about
it
for
the
most
part
it
has
to
be
reliable
easy
to
maintain
and
economical
ie
not
high
priced
paper
cartidges
etc
finally
and
this
is
my
little
dig
into
the
project
what
about
netting
these
things
we
have
ether
nearby
and
i
would
like
to
slap
the
macs
on
the
net
but
server
individual
ether
forget
about
it
it
is
going

be
astronomically
priced

the

is
going

laugh
at
you

you
ask
them
little
more

flaky

two
weeks
i
have
the
following
problem
on
two
has
a
simm
and
the
other
a
mb
simm
both
are
about
months
old
bought
from
different
vendors
and
installed
by
different
people
both
computers
begin
crashing
frequently
locking
up
and
ultimately
the
memory
chimes
crashes
would
almost
always
occur
if
you
moved
the
screen
and
sometimes
would
occur
when
you
werent
even
touching
the
computer
in
both
cases
taking
the
machine
apart
taking
the
memory
out
and
putting
it
back
in
solved
the
problem
for
awhile
but
then
it
would
comeback
my
marginally
educated
guess
as
to
whats
happening
is
that
larger
simms
are
lopsided
in
that
the
insertion
point
is
sort
of
a
pivot
point
and
after
time
they
begin
to
move
about
possible
because
of
pressure
on
the
keyboard
or
something
anyway
has
anyone
else
had
such
a
problem
or
solution
if
somehow
you
could
support
the
other
end
of
the
simm
to
prevent
it
from
moving

had

i
dont

the
answer
to
your
direct
question
but
if
the
mac
superdrive
can
read
msdos
disks
can
it
then
you
can
transfer
files
between
the
next
and
a
mac
by
using
msdos
formatted
disks
since
the
next
can
readwrite
that

and
if
youre

you
can
also
do

the

its

the

i
think
the
explanation
for

that
it

i
believe
things
that
could

would
be
factors
such
as
use

enhanced
in
the

which
the

differences

those

working

is

for

working

i
will
be

a
vga

with
iisi
for
a

soon
i
dont
have
any
clue
what
monitor
will
be
heres
the
story
the
iisi
cannot
supply
a
vga
output
however
some
vgatype
monitors
can
adequately
deal
with
the
video
signal
the
mac
uses
to
drive
the
apple
or
inch
high
resolution
color
displayie
apples
own
mode
so
if
you
wish
to
hook
one
of
these
monitors
up
to
your
iisi
you
need
a
an
adapter
that
converts
from
the
mac
connector
to
the
vgastyle
high
density
connector
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
its
own
mode
not
the
vga
mode
and
b
a
vga
monitor
that
can
deal
with
the
higher
bandwidth
of
the
mac
mode
over
the
vga
mode
which
as
i
stated
in
above
the
iisi
cannot
produce
as
far
as
a
above
is
concerned
contact
james
engineering
inc
fairmount
ave

ca
fax
they
can
probably
get
you
the
right
adapter
remember
you
do
not
want
the
runofthemill
mactovga
adapter
because
it
will
try
to
have
your
iisi
produce
the
vga
mode
which
it
cannot
the
computer
will
just
fail
to
produce
any
video
signal
at
all
instead
you
want
an
adapter
that
connects
between
the
macstyle
and
vgastyle
connectors
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
the
apple
mode
sorry
for
the
poor
terminology
available
for
describing
this
distinction
as
far
as
b
is
concerned
make
sure
to
get
a
monitor
that
can
deal
with
a
horizontal
bandwidth
of
khz
and
a
vertical
retrace
rate
of
hz
these
are
the
specs
of
apples
mode
for
comparison
the
vgastandard
mode
uses
a
khz
horizontal
bandwidth
and
a
hz
vertical
retrace
rate
the
monitor
will
probably
need
to
have
autosynching
capability
as
the
apple
mode
youll
be
using
isnt
one
of
the
set
of
standard
modes
in

the

when
i

the

it
was
clear
that
buying

cost
much
more
than
the
difference
in

between
the
two

there
is
an

in

you
will
not

how

one

was

i

until
it
became
completely

which
more
or
less
coincided
with
a

shutdown
at

and
a

out

town
i
had

gave

asked
about

the

got

rather
than
right
away
they
had
no

with
that
even
when
i
exceeded
the
normal

for

by

day
theyre
usually

days

was

how
to
test
simms
well
you
can
always
try
and
find
a
pc
dealer
who
sells
guaranteed
memory
i
work
at
a
company
growing
at
a
year
we
have
on
order
hundreds
of
computers
per
year
it
never
fails
machines
come
in
with
bad
simms
now
for
those
of
you
who
are
wondering
just
why
your
pc
or
mac
just
crashed
i
can
tell
you
i
always
thought
it
was
the
incompetent
ass
who
wrote
or
designed
the
software
well
i
dont
think
that
way
anymore
especially
with
the
results
i
have
gotten
with
replacing
bad
simms
in
my
own
machine
and
others
at
work
the
moral
to
this
story
is
to
make
sure
your
memory
is
good
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
lots
of
you
out
there
have
simms
with
either
soft
or
hard
errors
on
them
and
you
dont
even
know
about
it
but
every
once
in
awhile
those
bad
simms
just
makes
your
life
hell
i
just
got
plain
sick
of
dealing
with
peoples
complaints
that
thier
machine
just
crashed
and
they
lost
thier
work
in
case
your
wondering
or
if
you
havent
already
guessed
i
work
in
an
is
department
service
is
a
do
or
die
perogative
in
this
line
of
work
so
the
moral
is
have
your
memory
tested
with
a
simm
hardware
testerand
no
i
dont
mean
the
simple
little
software
programs
that
you
can
run
in
your
machine
simms
are
complicated
little
beasts
and
they
needs
special
hardware
to
test
them
effectively
if
any
of
you
are
interested
in
getting
one
of
these
nifty
little
devices
which
are
not
cheap
write
me
back
they
make
life
a
little
bit
easier
and
besides
they
pay
for
themselves
in
a
short
time
from
the
loss
of
productivity
people
would
have
to
deal
with
when
thier
machine
commits
suicide

according

official

failure

can
not
only
affect
scsi
bus
performance
but
can
also
damage
the

whether
this
is
your
problem
or
not
i
dont

i
have
had
sporadic
scsi
problems
with
my

since
i
bought
it
i
cannot
connect
more
than
three
devices
fourth
one
causes
major
problems
first
thing
to
do
is
to
try
to
reformat
your
drive
on
someone
elses
system
if
you
continue
to
get
errors
it
is
probably
the
drive
if
it
formats
fine
then
i
would
try
to
format
it
on
your
system
with
no
externals
if
this
fails
then
the
scsi
controller
on
your

needs

the

of

they

ah
but
why
can
some
technicallyhip
macslinger
tell
us
what
the
difference
is
between
pds
and
nubus
is
it
impossible
to
make
a
gadget
that
plugs
into
pds
and
ends
in
a
nubus
card
cage
at
least
marvins
friend
has
not
been
able
to
locate
one
and
neither
have
i
what
is
the
fundamental
reason
for
this
i
think
that
there
do
exist
nubus
expansion
cages
im
sure
ive
seen
them
advertised
occassionally
but
i
think
that
the
main
problem
is
that
they
cost
much
more
than
the
difference
in
price
between
say
a
lc
and
iivx
so
unless
you
need
lots
of
nubus
slots
its
not
worth
the
bother
of
course
it
may
be
that
these
extra
boxes
are
so
expensive
because
no
one
buys
them
because
they
are
so
expensive
nubus
technology
isnt
a
special
apple
proprietry
thing
i
have
this
sneaky
feeling
that
it
is
licensed
from
texas
instruments
so
there
is
no
problem
building
an
expansion
box
apple
uses

i
got
this
from

well
almost

anyway
comprehensive
bus
contention
between

is
not
supported
in

could
be
wrong
however
i
know
for
a
fact
from
seeing
the
cyclone
data
spec
sheets
myself
dont

macintosh

once

about

makes
more
than
ps
the
is
not

a
joke
scott
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
bunch
of
bunk
ive
got
a
computer
engineering
degree
yet
ive
spent
the
last
years
writing
software
that
people
actually
use
moreover
the
salary
distinctions
are
incorrect
i
received
job
offers
upon
graduation
the
two
jobs
that
actually
used
my
hardware
experience
were
lower
my
advice
is
to
decide
which
classes
and
projects
most
interest
you
and
pick
the
major
that
allows
you
to
take
them
emt
well
here
is
my
worth
advice
from
a
grad
student
i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
comment
before
me
the
important
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
it
in
my
five
years
of
education
in
this
field
though
brief
compare
to
alot
of
people
i
had
to
think
about
this
kind
of
question
a
lot
did
i
make
the
right
decision
in
going
into
electrical
engineering
as
opposed
to
computer
engineering
or
cs
the
more
i
go
thru
school
the
more
i
believe
that
this
kind
of
question
is
irrelevant
interesting
as
i
think
computer
technology
is
now
becomming
widespread
enough
now
that
it
is
no
longer
a
position
which
must
require
a
degree
i
know
of
several
people
i
work
with
that
make
just
as
much
as
i
do
and
they
dont
even
have
a
bs
degree
in
comp
sci
yet
they
make
a
year
they
also
didnt
have
to
pay
grand
to
thier
local
university
either
i
think
computer
programming
is
being
reduced
to
a
trade
practice
than
a
truly
specialty
field
it
will
be
even
more
so
in
the
future
if
your
interested
in
cutting
edge
type
of
stuff
and
you
choose
cs
as
i
did
i
suggest
checking
out
the
emerging
field
of
software
engineering
the
difficulties
for
example
of
designing
scaleable
design
environments
for
individuals
so
that
a
single
person
can
handle
to
million
lines
of
code
all
by
himself
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
then
incorporate
that
into
a
teamwork
enviroment
is
truly
a
gigantic
problemnot
going
to
be
solved
any
time
soon
unfortunatelybut
hey
you
could
be
the
person
that
provides
the
missing
key
for
some
good
groundwork
i
have
come
to
believe
that
choosing
cs
because
one
does
not
like
hardware
or
choosing
hardware
because
one
does
not
like
to
program
is
really
doing
an
injustice
of
building
and
computer
and
making
it
useful
for
something
everything
is
interwoven
and
inseparable
cs
ce
and
ee
are
all
a
part
of
a
really
great
discipline
and
do
depend
on
each
other
my
advice
is
dont
limit
yourself
but
make
a
decision
based
on
which
major
will
give
you
the
best
opportunities
to
learn
that
of
course
depends
on
the
curriculum
at
your
persective
school
i
would
choose
a
major
that
allows
me
to
explore
as
much
as
possible
beside
i
dont
know
why
the
school
would
make
a
student
choose
a
major
before
herhis
sophamore
year
hey
you
may
be
so
interested
in
this
field
that
you
decided
to
learn
all
about
the
making
of
computers
in
which
case
you
suffer
a
little
more
and
go
to
grad
school
about
the
money
dont
look
at
the
averages
if
you
are
good
you
are
going
to
earn
more
money
than
anyone
else
if
you
are
a
superstar
programmer
you
will
earn
millions
like
wise
if
you
are
a
hotshot
computer
designers
well
if
your

worldlike
me
you
are
in
no
financial
position
to

right

i
have
seen
similar

well
the

says
that
all

have
a

interface
but
then
it
says
that
the
dtr
rate
for
each
drive
is
megabytessecond
max
how
can
this
be
i
thought
that
if
a
drive
was
to
be
fast
it
had
to
have
a
dtr

i
am
assuming
the
claim

i
admit
that
i
would

if

told

that
they

he
didnt
go
into
details
but
mentioned
problems
with
the

intermittent

with

it
sounded
to
me
like
they
were
having
both
hardware
problems
and
software
compatibility
problems
with
the
machine
hes
not
recommending
the
centris
to
anybody
he
says
to
consider
a

or
a
iivx
why
he
would
recommend
a
iivx
over
an
lciii
i
dont
know
but
thats
what
he
said
so
what
does
the
net
think
did
the
dealer
just
get
one
flaky
machine
or
did

send

is
your

great

jay
scott
scottcsuiucedu
sounds
to
me
like
your
dealer
really
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
iivxs
he
has
in
stock
i
can
imaging
that
they
are
getting
hard
to
sell
given
that
a
is
way
faster
and
is
comparable
in
price
an
lciii
is
about
the
same
speed
and
is
way
cheaper
so
your
dealer
may
well
be
trying
as
hard
as
he
can
to
convince
people
that
iivxs
are
a
much
better
buy
than
a
just
so
he
can
get
rid
of
all
his
old
stock
no
disrespect
to

it
doesnt
matter
if

i
remember
reading
that
apple
also

that
the

the

the

approximately
four
months
ago
i
purchased
a
quantum

from
la

for
after
two
months
the
drive
started
having
problems
first
there
were
intermittent
freezes
then
corrupted
files
and
resources
then
silverlining
wouldnt
even
recognize
the
drive
so
i
got
an
rma
from
la
cie
and
exchanged
the
new
drive
for
a
reconditioned
one
well
about
a
month
has
passed
now
and
the
second
drive
is
having
problems
often
when
i
boot
up
my
iisi
i
get
the
flashing
question
mark
sometimes
if
i
then
insert
the
silverlining
program
i
can
get
it
to
recognize
the
drive
by
making
it
scan
over
and
over
for
drives
at
that
point
i
can
restart
the
iisi
and
boot
from
the
hd
ive
called
la
cie
again
and
theyve
given
me
another
rma
their
tech
support
people
tell
me
that
if
silverlining
doesnt
see
the
drive
theres
a
definite
hardware
problem
given
that
this
is
the
second
bad
drive
in
four
months
i
asked
la
cie
to
send
me
a
new
one
but
they
said
no
also
within
three
weeks
after
i
purchased
my
original
drive
la
cie
dropped
the
price
on
it
by
over
i
can
accept
that
a
drive
or
two
may
be
bad
and
i
know
that
hardware
vendors
make
a
practice
of
sending
reconditioned
replacements
when
they
do
repairs
and
i
understand
that
the
nature
of
the
computer
industry
lends
itself
to
sudden
price
fluctuations
nevertheless
taken
together
the
convergence
of
these
factsevents
have
left
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
i
should
have
added
above
that
when
i
asked
la
cie
to
transfer
the
contents
of
my
current
drive
to
the
one
they
will
sendi
think
the
data
is
still
in
good
shape
and
ill
have
to
again
reinstall
everything
from
floppiesthey
said
it
would
cost
me
for
data
recovery
it
seems
to
me
that
reconditioned
hardware
should
be
sold
as
reconditioned
at
a
discounted
price
and
that
replacements
for
new
hardware
gone
bad
still
covered
under
a
warranty
should
be
new

the

at

called
the

and
found
that
you
cant
have
simms

different

in

even
if
they
are
both
fast
enough
ie
my

just
thought
people
might
want
to
know
theres
absolutely
no

why
differences
in

alone
would
cause
an

there
would
have
to
be
another
difference
between
the

for
there
to
be
a

ive
often
used
memory
of
different

with
no
problems
whatsoever
as
long
as
its
as
fast
or
faster
than
the
minimum
requirement
you
should
be
fine
just
out
of
curiosity
did
you
actually
try
this
and
see
a
problem
or
were
you
told
it
wouldnt
work

so
never
tried
it

wanted

also

might

the

generally
recognize

i
have
no
intention

changing
the

i
post
i
installed
a
couple
of
simms
in

quadra
and
was
somewhat
dismayed
by
the
general
complexity
of
the
operation
compared
to
for
example
the
wonderfully
designed
lc
iii
it
irritates
me
when
apple
refuses
to
tell
how
to
do
it
in
the
users
manual
so
you
have
to
guess
at
how
to
disassemble
the
devise
in
question
its
the
same
for
adding
memory
to
laserwriter
pros
it
isnt
apples
responsibility
to
tell
its
customers
how
to
fool
around
with
its
hardware
that
is
what
apple
service
techs
get
paid
to
do
i
personally
like
the
design
of
the
and
applaud
apple
for
coming
up
with
a
good
way
to
make
use
of
the
front
space
for
all
of
those
drive
bays
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
the
design
except
for
those
people
who
need
drive
arrays
i
do
however
agree
with
you
about
the
lw
pro
design
the
operation
isnt
very
complicated
if
even
a
minimal
amount
of
help
were
offered
but
apple
leaves
you
working
blind
again
itss
not
apples
place
to
make
it
easy
for
noncertified
service
people
to
fool
around
with
apple
hardware
even
if
they
did
buy
it
of
course
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
to
your
mac
just
dont
get
upset
when
your
apple
service
rep
tells
you
that
your
warranty
is
no
longer
valid
after
the
memory
was
installed
i
was
distraught
that
the
top
of
the
simms
came
into
contact
with
the
plastic
case
frame
mine
actually
contacted
the
framework
with
quite
a
lot
of
pressure
enough
so
that
the
assembly
of
the
board
back
to
the
proper
position
was
rather
difficult
and
required
some
force
i
could
have
filed
a
little
excess
material
off
the
top
of
the
simm
boards
but
chose
to
let
it
stand
as
is
i
have
not
had
problems
with
ram
yet
so
i
will
consider
the
problem
annoying
but
not
catastrophic
this
sounds
like
the
kind
of
problem
i
had
when
i
installed
simms
into
an
lc
back
before
lowprofile
simms
were
readily
available
the
standard
simms
would
contact
the
top
of
the
case
and
make
it
a
bit
difficult
to
close
the
lc

this

even
if
i
disconnect
the

from

this

activity
continues
at

someone
tried
to
tell
me
the

was
doing
a
thermal

not
knowing
beans
about
the
internal
physical
workings
of
the
lastest
disk
drive
technology
i
guess
i
might
believe
anything
whats
the
scoop
on
this
standalone
drive
activity
every
sec
i
can
only
comment
on
thermal
recalibration
in
general
some
new
drives
perform
it
in
order
to
increase
overall
integrity
of
data
writes
basically
the
firmware
instructs
the
actuator
to
perform
a
test
to
see
if
the
data
tracks
are
within
a
certain
physical
tolerance
since
when
the
media
heats
up
or
cools
down
some
track
drift
is
inevitable
and
the
drive
has
to
monitor
it
this
becomes
especially
critical
at
very
high
recording
densities
and
so
was
used
primarily
on
very
largecapacity
mechanisms
but
it
seems
to
be
finding
its
way
into
more
smaller
drives
as
a
way
of
boosting
the
drives
longterm
reliability
and
mtbf
ratings
i
first
became
aware
of
thermal
recalibration
when
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
technique
conflicts
with
prolonged
write
times
when
digitizing
say
audio
or
video
to
hard
disk
some
manufacturers
explicitly
state
that
drives
with
thermal
recalibration
are
not
to
be
used
for
applications
that
have
prolonged

if

decompress

the

the

it

the

i
have
got
the
drive
to
format
it
took
a
while
to
get
things
to
work
and
most
of
it
is
fine
for
now
the
formating
initialy
was
troublesome
but
seems
to
be
ok
the
main
problem
is
if
you
do
a
reset
on
the
macplus
the
drive
disappears
if
i
shut
the
mac
off
and
then
back
on
agian
then
the

comes
up
fine

macweek
reports

is
that
it
may
come
sooner
if
apple
decides
to
change
the

structure
upon
release
of

this

your

looks
pretty
good
at
about
more

i
payed
for

i
would
have
rather
waited
for
one

the
resale
value
of
my

would
have
not
been
squat
by
then
thus
financing
forced
me
to
purchase
now
im
happy
with

wont

if

you

you
might

wait
for

that
with

you
can
still
only
use
serial

at

it
just
prevents
you
from

may

im
not

only
had

a
little
less
than
a

and
had
the
cds
shipped

my
home
address
in
california
instead
of
here
in
maryland
the
cdtechnology
drive
has
a
separate
power
supply
separated
from
the

which
supposedly
gives
it
a
longer
life
and
keeps
it
cleaner
with
no
fan
to
attract
dust
a
toshiba
brand
drive
is
also
available

i
think
the

is
better
since
you
get
the

mechanism
and
at
a
slightly
lower
price
with
two
free

the
apple

sony

is
around

i
think

a

of
i
know
it
is
the
slowest

it
is

is

been
out
the
longest

including

it
wasnt

before
but
i
hear
that
the
current

that
is

is
owners
of
the
older

can
get
an

it
does
not
come
with
any
free

unless
you
buy
it
in

drives
above
i
think
the
best
choices
would
be
the
apple

and
the

the
apple

for
its

megabytes
sec
for
very

data
transfers
around

i
have

i
have

card
that
can

at

using

transfers
i
have
a
highspeed
disk
array
no
asynchronous
pb
calls
that
can
achieve
mbs
lets
say
all
transfers
go
from
disk
to
buffer
to
network
card
it
is
not
enough
to
first
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
disk
to
buffer
then
transfer
all
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
card
mbs
then
mbs
result
in
an
overall
mbs
too
slow
so
i
tried
the
following
scheme
for
an
nmegabyte
transfer
step
load
the
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
asynch
send
mb
out
card
load
the
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
asynch
send
mb
out
card
load
the
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
n
asynch
send
the
mb
out
card
load
the
nth
mb
from
disk
to
buffer
step
send
the
nth
mb
out
card
even
though
the
code
apparently
does
execute
the
card
transfer
asynchronously
and
the
card
does
not
use
the
mac
cpu
at
all
it
is
using
the
buffer
tho
each
of
the
steps
through
n
take
as
long
as
if
the
two
transfers
were
executed
one
after
another
so
there
is
no
improvement
in
the
rate
why
is
the
mac
ram
dualport
so

new

dock
with

heres
why
well
folks
after
some
thought
the
answer
struck
me
flat
in
the
face
why
would
apple
release
a
duo
dock
with
a

of
its
own
heres
why
people
have
hounded
apple
for
a
notebook
with
a
processor
in
it
apple
cant
deliver
that
right
now
because
the
saps
too
much
power
radiates
far
too
much
heat
and
is
too
large
for
a
notebook
how
does
one
get
around
that
without
designing
a
new
chipset
use
existing
powerbook
technology
to
your
best
advantage
the
duo
dock
gives
apple
a
unique
ability
to
give
users
that
power
in
a
semiportable
fashion
by
plunking
the
into

dock
youve
got
quadra
power
at
your
desk
on

that
should
be
able
to
handle
most

okay
not
the
best
solution
but
its
an

so
does
this

i
followed
the

for
returning
the

expecting

within
a

well
months
went
by
and
no

after
many
calls
almost
none

were
ever
returned
arghhh
i
finally
found
someone
who
told
me
why
we
never
received
your
old
chips
i
then
explained
i
the
procedure
that
i
had
followed
to
return
them
to
which
the
person
replied
you
mean
you
sent
them
us

i
had
per
the

instructions
i
was
told
that
they
their

come

that
i
should
have
sent
the

i

warned

did

apparently

my
minor
grip
with

is
that
they
have
different

i
ordered

thinking
i
got
their
best

because
of
my

i
subsequently
found
out
that
apple
was
offering
developers
memory
for
less
than
techworks
charged
called
up
to
complain
and
was
told
i
should
have
said
i
was
an

they
credited
my

dealing

it
is
a
good
idea
to
completely
discharge
a
nicad
cell
periodically
it
is
not
a
good
idea
to
completely
discharge
a
nicad

the
difference
being
that
a
cell
is
only
one
cell
nicad
puts
out
volts

aaa
aa
c

d
a

for
nicad
equivalent
due

differences
in

individual
cells
of

complete
discharge
can
actually
harm
a
nicad
battery
more
than
help
it
overcome
the
memory
effect
the
most
common
problem
is
that
over
time
an
individual
cell
can
develop
internal
shorts
which
will
weaken
other
cells
that
are
connected
to
it
thus
reducing
the

you

i
would

very
wary

selling
as
cheap
as
educational

i
went
for
a
retailer
actually
mail
order
cda

because
its

was
better
thant
the

store
i
found
out
why
later
on
when
i
tried
to
get
a
repair
done
at
an
apple
registered
repair
center
the
cpu
was
a
resale
the
serial
number
had
been
removed
and
replaced
with
a
nonstandard
number
probably
from
cda
computers
consequently
the
apple
repair
man
could
not
do
any
warrenty
repairs
so
i
ended
up
with
just
a
warrenty
from
cda
over
the
apple
warrenty
boy
was
i
pied
moral
of
the
story
caveat
emptor
however
if
you
go
with
a
reliable
trustworthy
mail
order
firm
if
they
exist
maybe
someone
could
enlighten
us
with
their
experiences
you
will
probably
get
a
better
price
than
your
local
educational
outlet
simply
because
mail
order
out
of
state
does
not
require
sales
tax
yet
though
for
how
much
longer
remains
to
be

the
addition

will

anyone

a

to

the

about
meaning
the

makes
more

the

is
that
most

people
write
programs
that
people

use

database

an

you
can
find
retail
that

within
the
price
of
a

of
educational

i
would
be
very
wary
of
retail
outlets
selling
as
cheap
as
educational
prices
i
went
for
a
retailer
actually
mail
order
cda

because
its
price
was
better
thant
the
campus
computer
store
i
found
out
why
later
on
when
i
tried
to
get
a
repair
done
at
an
apple
registered
repair
center
the
cpu
was
a
resale
the
serial
number
had
been
removed
and
replaced
with
a
nonstandard
number
probably
from
cda
computers
consequently
the
apple
repair
man
could
not
do
any
warrenty
repairs
so
i
ended
up
with
just
a
warrenty
from
cda
over
the
apple
warrenty
boy
was
i
pied
moral
of
the
story
caveat
emptor
apple
does
not
authorise
sales
through
mail
order
as
a
result
mail
order
companies
have
to
obtain
their
machines
by
the
grey
market
this
market
is
supplied
with
machines
from
authorised
resellers
who
have
more
machines
than
they
can
sell
they
come
into
this
state
of
affairs
by
overordering
either
accidentally
or
deliberatly
to
get
a
better
wholsale
price
from
apple
in
either
case
they
often
obscure
the
serial
nunber
to
protect
their
identity
as
a
result
the
warranty
is
void
you
may
save
on
sales
tax
but
you
have
to
pay
for
shipping
i
should
also
point
out
that
mail
order
companies
cannot
get
lower
prices
thatn
the
high
volume
authorised
dealers
unless
they
buy
below
dealer
cost
as
a
result
the
only
way
they
can
sell
cheaper
is
by
cutting
costs
and
trimming
margins
unfortunatly
they
dont
seem
to
be
doing
too
well
the
lowest

i
have
been

do
not
beat
the

they
are

they

this
may

id
recommend
waiting

ben
roy
just
a
poor
college
ben
since
youre
obviously
adept
enough
to
understand
how
the
trackball
works
the
only
thing
short
of
repairing
it
that
i
can
think
of
is
a
thorough
cleaning
of
all
the
parts
and
then
checking
for
the
proper
placement
of
the
little
blue
rollers
since
they
arent
fixed
in
position
on
their
stainless
steel
pins
you
might
try
sliding
them
into
a
slightly
different
position
on
my
powerbook
i
can
slide
them
almost
completely
out
of
contact
with
the
trackball
in
fact
one
of
the
notes
from
sumex
on
fixing
the
trackball
advocates
sliding
the
roller
so
that
its
edge
contacts
the
ball
not
the
center
cylindrical
area
ive
done
this
with
my
and
it
does
seem
to
improve
the
feel
but
needs
to
be
adjusted
from
time
to
time
i
just
popped
open
one
of
our
offices
and
while
there
isnt
as
much
latitude
for
movement
one
could
still
adjust
the
roller
slightly
if
your
is
the
same
it
might
help
i
would
suspect
the
most
likely
culprit
to
be
a
slippery
blue
roller
if
you
can
take
it
out
clean
it
with
a
mild
soapy
solution
or
isopropyl
alcohol
also
be
sure
the
ball
is
greasefree
if
you
drop
the
ball
in
minus
the
retaining
ring
roll
the
ball
and
see
if
it
is
actually
causing
the
axle
to
spin
if
all
this
still
doesnt
solve
it
then
maybe
a
new
one
is
in
order
it
could
be
an
electrical
connection
in
which
case
replacement
would
be
necessary
but
my
experience
with
both
mice
and
trackballs
has
been
that
dirt
has
been
the
normal
problem
not
an
electrical
malfunction

this

your

thats

only
the

the
and
all
have
a

only
i
distinctly
remembered
this
because
when
got

all

are

i
eventually
had
to
go

ordered

oversized
version
of
an

that
must
be
used
with

for
the
rest

my
advise
to
the
very
original
poster
beverly
is
if
all
you
want
is
to
create
a
lan
with
two
workstations
and
wont
add
machines
to
it
ever
go
for
thinwire
regardless
of
the
media
type
going
for
utp
unshielded
twisted
pair
wiring
requires
a
concentrator
which
means
extra
money
and
i
believe
these
units
come
with
at
least
ports
as
for
thicknet
its
a
nightmare
and
cabling
is
expensive
avoid
it
unless
you
have
no
choice
eg
the
two
machines
are
two
floors
parts
on
the
mac
side
you
will
need
one
thinwire
media
adapter
from
apple
or
thirdparty
macx
make
sure
you
get
version
wont
run
on
system
mactcp
which
comes
with
macx
if
you
get
macx
you
should
be
getting
mactcp
with
it
dont
use
earlier
versions
on
a
centris
you
may
or
may
not
need
a
terminator
depending
on
the
thinwire
media
adapter
so
just
ask
the
sales
if
the
adapter
is
selfterminated
or
not
configure
mactcp
to
use
ethernet
on
the
decstation
side
you
will
need
for
a
model
you
will
only
need
a
tconnector
for
models
you
will
need
an
auitobnc
adapter
get
one
that
can
be
plugged
in
directly
to
the
aui
port
of
the
decstation
this
way
you
save
the
cost
of
a
transciever
cable
a
aui
male
to
a

get
a

converting

i
have
this
extra
keyboard
which
i
would
like
to
use
on
the
plus
but
theres
a
little
problem
the
plus
uses
an
jack
for
keyboard
input
and
the
new
keyboards
dont
i
got
an
extra
adb
cable
from
my
local
apple
dealer
theyre
such
nice
people
but
they
couldnt
tell
me
the
order
of
the
wires
there
are
four
wires
in
the
adb
cables
black
white
red
tan
i
know
ones
a
ground
one
gets
the
serial
signal
one
supplies
volts
and
i
forgot
what
the
fourth
one
does
anyway
if
you
hook
them
up
wrong
youll
fry
a
board
and
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
if
any
brave
souls
out
there
have
done
this
before
please
email
your
experience
directly
to
me
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
especially
since
apples
original
keyboard
is
not
ergonomically
correct
btw
i
did
take
apart
my
new
keyboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
correlation
between
the
wires
for
the
jack
and
the
adb
since
it
has
both

no

connections
are

adding
int
hard
disk
drive
to
iicx
i
havent
seen
much
info
about
how
to
add
an
extra
internal
disk
to
a
mac
we
would
like
to
try
it
and
i
wonder
if
someone
had
some
good
advice
we
have
a
mac
iicx
with
the
original
internal
quantum
hard
disk
and
an
unusable
floppy
drive
we
also
have
a
new
spare
connor
disk
which
we
would
like
to
use
the
idea
is
to
replace
the
broken
floppy
drive
with
the
new
hard
disk
but
there
seems
to
be
some
problems
the
internal
scsi
cable
and
power
cable
inside
the
cx
has
only
connectors
for
one
single
hard
disk
drive
if
i
made
a
ribbon
cable
and
a
power
cable
with
three
connectors
each
for
motherboard
for
each
of
the
disks
would
it
work
is
the
iicx
able
to
supply
the
extra
power
to
the
extra
disk
what
about
terminators
i
suppose
that
i
should
remove
the
resistor
packs
from
the
disk
that
is
closest
to
the
motherboard
but
leave
them
installed
in
the
other
disk
the
scsi
id
jumpers
should
also
be
changed
so
that
the
new
disk
gets
id
the
old
one
should
have
id
it
is
no
problem
for
us
to
remove
the
floppy
drive
as
we
have
an
external
floppy
that
we
can
use
if
it

mac

many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded

quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi

this
results
in
silent

i

this
doesnt
sound
right
to

dont

the

nothing

could

is
if
apple

the

however
should
only
really
hurt

disabling

should
be
meaningless
on

on

that
used
the
which
is
a
much
lower
level
scsi
chip
the

was
responsible

affected
how

disappearing

disappeared
for
a
day
last

id
like

hear

happened
it

shut
down

i
was
out

town
and
we
sometimes
have
thunderstorms
this
time
of
year
and
upon
restarting
got
a
blinking
question
mark
i
booted
from
a
floppy
and
saw
that
my
external
hd
seemed
okay
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
internal
i
installed
a
system
folder
on
the
external

was
indeed
able
to
boot
from
it
i
tried
things

to
inquire
about
the

they
either
could
not
find
it
or
got

talk

silverlining
claimed
it
was
a
connor
drive
but
it
is
a
quantum
well
id
backed
things
up
so
i
was
able
to
work
but
at
some
point
i
noticed
that
the
internal
had
reappeared
now
disk
first
aid
says
that
alls
well

things
seem
to
be
fine
but
what
happened
was
this
a
warning
that
something
the
internal

or
something
else
is
about
to
die
im
definitely
nervous

if
this
is

sick

it
true

its
not
a
good
idea
to
have
a
horizontally
formatted
hard
disk
in
a
vertical
position
if
the
drive
is
formatted
in
a
horizontal
position
it
can
not
completely
compensate
for
the
gravitational
pull
in
a
vertical

your

will
fail

i
asked
this
question
a
while
ago
while
contemplating
placing
my

its

i
received
a
response
from
someone
at
seagate
sorry
i
trashed
the
message
stating
that
most
newer
drives
seagates
at
the
least
can
very
well
compensate
for
gravity
this
means
that
a
horizontally
formatted
drive
can
be
later
placed
vertically
with
no
data
integrity
problems
the
only
way
that
newer
drives
cannot
work
is
if
you
have
varying
forces
shaking
bouncing
etc
so
dont
place
the
drive
on
its
side
on
a
rocking
chair
what
constitutes
a
newer
drive
i
dont
know
try
calling
your

since

attention
mac
quadra
owners
many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
an
example
would
be
a
sony
inch
mo
without
the
special
maccompatible
firmware
installed
one
solution
sometimes
is
to
disable
blind
writes
this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the
if
so
the
mac
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by
the
chip
about
the
only
the
timing
could
be
wrong
is
if
apple
programs
the
clock
registers
wrong
on
the
that
however
should
only
really
hurt
synchronous
transfer
which
is
not
used
by
the
mac
scsi
manager
furthermore
disabling
blind
writes
should
be
meaningless
on
a
quadra
on
macs
that
used
the
which
is
a
much
lower
level
scsi

the
mac
was
responsible
for
the
handshake
of

transferred
blind
mode
affected
how
the

handled
that
handshake
on
the
the
handshake
is
entirely
handled
by
the

the

deals
with
the

path
that
each

i
suspect
though
that
they

interleaved

some
extent
so
that
bits
can
be
read

written
at

this
would
indicate
a

interleave
i

not
confusing
this
with

longword
interleave
with
two

of

that
seems

be

instead
of
just
a

yes
the

cant
handle
it

when
writing

it
speeds
something
up
so
dale
am
i
right
simms
are
interleaved
by
bytes
allowing

many

keyboard
question
for
the
plus
i
have
an
old
mac
plus
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
bought
a
shiney
new
lc
it
came
with
apples
new
keyboard
with
abd
ports
i
replaced
it
with
a
macproplus
extended
keyboard
which
i
thoroughly
enjoy
thank
you
very
much
well
i
have
this
extra
keyboard
which
i
would
like
to
use
on
the
plus
but
theres
a
little
problem
the
plus
uses
an
jack
for
keyboard
input
and
the
new
keyboards
dont
i
got
an
extra
adb
cable
from
my
local
apple
dealer
theyre
such
nice
people
but
they
couldnt
tell
me
the
order
of
the
wires
there
are
four
wires
in
the
adb
cables
black
white
red
tan
i
know
ones
a
ground
one
gets
the
serial
signal
one
supplies
volts
and
i
forgot
what
the
fourth
one
does
anyway
if
you
hook
them
up
wrong
youll
fry
a
board
and
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
if
any
brave
souls
out
there
have
done
this
before
please
email
your
experience
directly
to
me
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
especially
since
apples
original
keyboard
is
not
ergonomically
correct
btw
i
did
take
apart
my
new
keyboard
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
correlation
between
the
wires
for
the
jack
and
the
adb
since
it
has
both
but
no
such
luck
the
connections
are
soldered
inside
of
little
boxes
oh
well
one
more
thing
in
case
you
are
thinking
that
the
abd
ports
on
the
newer
models
are
different
from
the
connection
used
on
the
plus
youre
right
however
you
can
use
the
telephone
cable
from
the
plus
and
connect
the
macproplus
keyboard
via
its
own
jack
in
other
words
this
little
engineering
feat
i
wish
to
do
is
possible
its
merely
a
matter
of
finding
out
the
correct
order
omt
when
i
get
this
to
work
i
definitely
will
post
the
solution

can
too

the
plan
i
have
is
to
build
a

with
a

different
crystals
on
it
and
to
be
able
to
switch
between
the
different
speeds
using
a

pannel
switch
this
way
i
can
get
the
speed
when
i
want
but
i
can
also
run
at
slower
stock
speeds
it
i
experience
any
compatability
problems
with
any
applications
i
dont
expect
to
be
able
to
switch
clock
speeds
with
the
system
running
but
if
i
can
switch
without
any
lockup
problems
then
i
could
switch
to
when
needed
and
put
it
back
to
idle
mhz
when
not
needeed
this
would
further
reduce
the
wearandtear
on
the
cpu
even
with
a
heat
sink
of
course
i
would
not
want
to
run
the
different
clock
signals
through
the
switch
but
use
a
chip
or
two
on
the
board
to
select
the
frequency
desired
and
route
it
directly
to

that
mentioned
removing

dropping
it
in

i
was

a

my

where

can

i
noticed
that

will
lay

i
didnt
look
closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the

would
that
cause

asking

on

quadra
and
opinions
on
the
upgrade
of
a

vs
an

so
far
no
responsed
that
ive
noticed
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
of
these
possible

cost
efficiency
proscons
etc
thanks
complete
are
best
obtained
from
your
dealer
or
some
recent
copy
of
macworld
or
macuser
my
foggy
memory
suggests
that
the
most
relevant
comparison
factors
visavis
a
iici
are
as
follows
mhz
mhz
data
path
dont
recall
this
for
sure
but
its
slower
than
q
style
machines
for
sure
ethertalk
card
onboard
audio
inout
mb
ram
on
motherboard
simm
slots
nubus
slots
more
flexible
buildin
video
than
the
ci
uses
vram
in
comparison
a
iici
with
an
accelerator
wont
give
you
audio
or
ethernet
or
the
same
video
options
with
a
accelerator
cpu
performance
can
be
comparable
but
i
think
it
ends
up
costing
more
greg
dudek
actually
an
accelerator
such
as
the
daystar
mhz
is
cheaper
than
upgrading
to
a
mhz
the
accelerator
costs
about
whereas
the
upgrade
costs
just
quoted
from
my
dealer
however
the
upgrade
gives
you
very
fast
built
in
video
that
supports
monitors
up
to
with
bit
depth
and
up
to
at
bit
depth
with
additional
vram
it
also
has
a
scsi
port
capable
of
a
much
faster
throughput
than
the
ci
which
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
have
a
fast
hard
drive
if
the
improved
video
and
scsi
features
are
important
to
you
youre
better
off
getting
the
upgrade
otherwise
save
some
money
and
get

quadras
vram
question
hi
there
i
have
a
question
regarding
quadras
vram
i
have
tried
to
find
info
on
this
but
i
could
not
get
precise
answers
on
one
hand
we
have
a
quadra
with
a
monitor
which
is
capable
of
color
how
much
vram
does
it
have
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
quadra
with
a
monitor
which
is
capable
of
color
only
so
it
must
have
ko
of
vram
i
would
like
to
take
vram
simms
for
the
and
put
them
in
the
so
that
both
machines
have
color
capability
is
it
possible
and
if
yes
how
many
vram
simms
should
i
take
from
the
from
the
documentation
i
have
the
quadra
must
get
mo
vram
to
have
color
is
that
correct
bonus
question
where
do
vram
simms
hide
from
the
documentation
they
seem
to
be
behind
the
power
supply
do
i
really
have
to
take
off
the

scsi
woes
on
mac
iifx
i
am
having
trouble
with
scsi
on
a
mac
iifx
the
machine
is
years
old
and
i
have
been
using
the
same
hard
drive
internal
maxtor
for
two
and
a
half
years
the
disk
recently
crashed
i
reformatted
silverlining
but
during
the
reformat
i
received
random
write
errors
during
testing
the
error
message
reported
was
like
sector
write
error
detected
after
testing
good
sector
not
mapped
out
this
occurred
randomly
all
over
the
hard
disk
which
makes
me
suspect
the
diagnostics
reference
to
sector
on
the
third
reformat
and
after
reinstalling
the
scsi
readwrite
loops
i
was
able
to
get
through
passes
and
with
no
errors
pass
for
some
reason
reported
a
lot
of
errors
but
still
mapped
out
no
sectors
i
decided
to
go
ahead
and
try
to
resinstall
system
and
reload
my
data
from
a
backup
this
proceded
normally
however
i
now
have
suboptimal
performance
symptoms
include
o
frequent
crashes
o
instances
of
extremely
sluggish
disk
access
requiring
a
reboot
to
correct
o
instances
of
not
finding
the
disk
on
the
scsi
chain
on
reboot
if
i
boot
from
norton
utl
after
this
occurs
it
cannot
find
the
disk
either
the
only
thing
that
fixes
this
is
recycling
the
power
it
sometimes
requires
several
attempts
questions
has
anyone
had
this
type
of
problem
before
is
the
problem
with
the
fx
motherboard
and
its
nonstandard
scsi
implementation
or
with
my
maxtor
disk
is
there
some
diagnostic
software
that
would
help
me
make
this
determination
is
it
a
termination
problem
i
currently
have
external
syquest
and
an
external
dataframe
on
the
chain
the
is
at
the
end
and
has
internal
termination
so
i
am
not
using
the
iifx
terminator
i
do
have
the
scsi
filter
installed
on
the
internal
drive
i
have
run
with
this
exact
steup
for
years
with
one
previous
disk
crash
requiring
a
reformat
about
a
year
ago
i
also
have
symptoms
if
i
disconnect
the
external
devices
so
i
dont
see
how
scsi
termination
would
now
be
an
issue
of
course
who
knows
help
would
be
much
appreciated

a
twoyear

attention
a

certain
defective

at
random
the

stick
in

clicked
a
second
time
apparently
regardless
of
the
machine
they
are
used
with
or
the
system
software
involved
most
of
the
reported
problem
mice
were
manufactured
in
malaysia
and
have
an
fcc

of
youll
recognize
this
sticky

symptom
immediately
if
you
have
such
a
mouse
the
problem
is
intermittent
but
its
not
subtle
liam

recently
gave
up

instead
suggested
that
people
contact

directly
macweek
p
when
i
called
apple
on
march
and
described
my
defective
mouse
i
was
eventually
given
a
case
number
and
told
apple
would
replace
this
mouse
even
though
it
is
a
few
months
out
of
warranty
after
waiting
for
three
weeks
i
called
back
today
wondering
where
my
new

was
this
time
i
was
told
that
apple
had
decided
the
serial
number
on
my
mouse
is
not
within
the
undisclosed
range
apple
is
willing
to
replace
and
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
nothing
that
is

enough
people
complain
about
this

to
make
it
worth

to
fix

replace
the

mice
please
if
you
have
one
of
these
mice
i
need
your
help
dont
assume
you
know
what
causes
the

there
are
lots

nec
iivi
hello
all
for
few
past
days
ive
been
fighting
to
get
my
nec
multisync
predecessor
of
to
work
properly
with
the
internal
video
of
mac
iivi
with
a
vgaadapter
as
described
in
dale
adams
posting
about
quadra
video
it
works
only
some
minor
interferences
occur
small
enough
not
to
prevent
any
action
on
screen
to
be
visible
clear
but
because
the
scanrates
stuff
of
are
well
enough
for
emulating
apple
rgb
i
first
made
an
adapter
then
got
one
fron
the
local
distributor
of
nec
with
both
adapters
i
can
get
a
picure
which
looks
excellent
most
of
the
time
or
every
now
and
then
but
with
radical
changes
on
screen
opening
palettes
large
windows
etc
there
are
major
interferences
in
sync
the
picture
either
tilts
sideways
or
scrables
up
totally
even
when
it
is
clear
there
are
some
spiky
interferences
on
horizontal
line
alignment
when
accessing
pulldowns
etc
with
the
selfmade
adapter
almost
identical
to
the
vga
one
only
sense
pins
differ
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
even
boot
up
with
a
picture
clear
enough
to
shut
down
from
menu
with
the
adapter
from
nec
everything
is
well
most
of
the
time
but
sometimes
the
picture
tilts
badly
sideways
or
the
sync
is
completely
lost
but
not
nearly
as
often
as
with
the
selfmade
one
i
know
with
self
made
adapters
there
can
always
be
interference
but
with
the
one
provided
by
nec
wheres
the
source
of
this
interference
ill
give
you
the
pinouts
of
the
whole
mess
and
i
hope
that
you
can
at
least
someone
please
try
figure
out
what
could
be
the
best
pin

im
compacting
my

moving

so
i
have
two

nothing
at

is
wrong
with

im
just
wanting
to
conserve

and
get

id
prefer

within

like

perhaps
but
i
can
ship

only
problem
is
that
i
didnt
keep
the
original

for
the

but
im
confident
that
my
few
months
of

im
going

although
id

it
still
selling

where
i
bought
it
originally
not

the
pb
what
i
want

know
is
what
are
the
differences
between
them
all
i
know
is
that
the
portable
is
heavier

the
doesnt
have
an

what
i

the

is
it
impossible

ends

cage
at
least
marvins
friend
has
not
been
able
to
locate
one
and
neither
have
i
what
is
the
fundamental
reason
for
this
i
think
that
there
do
exist
nubus
expansion
cages
im
sure
ive
seen
them
advertised
occassionally
but
i
think
that
the
main
problem
is
that
they
cost
much
more
than
the
difference
in
price
between
say
a
lc
and
iivx
so
unless
you
need
lots
of
nubus
slots
its
not
worth
the
bother
of
course
it
may
be
that
these
extra
boxes
are
so
expensive
because
no
one
buys
them
because
they
are
so
expensive
nubus
technology
isnt
a
special
apple
proprietry
thing
i
have
this
sneaky
feeling
that
it
is
licensed
from
texas
instruments
so
there
is
no
problem
building
an
expansion
box
the
difference
between
nubus
and
pds
is
that
nubus
is
a
clever
interface
with
lots
of
neat
toys
built
in
to
make
sure
that
lots
of
cards
can
work
together
on
the
same
computer
pds
processor
direct
slot
is
just
that
here
are
all
the
connections
to
the
processor
you
can
do
anything
with
this
and
it
is
as
quick
as
it
can
be
but
theres
no
cooperation
you
may
be
able
to
get
double
pds
slot
adaptors
but
you
try
plugging
video
cards
in
and
just
watch
them
conflict
of
course
the
extra
electronics
in
a
nubus
slot
makes
it
appreciably
more
expensive
so
guess
why
apple
doesnt
put
it
in
its
cheaper
machines
so
yah
pays
yer
money
and
yah
takes
yah

you

why

you

i
noticed
that
the

i
didnt

closely
but
i
seem
to
recall
it
laying
over
the

thats

would
that
cause
problems
yeah
when
i
first
installed

i
was
a
little
concerned
too

its
no

the

is

they

part
of
the
reason
i
want
a
laptop
mac
is
so
i
can
use
it
as
a
remote

from
wherever
i
am

i
really
would
hate
to
have
to
wait
months
to
get
a

have
to
settle
with

if
apple
didnt
put
out
such
a
good
product
id
gladly
take
my
business
to
to
the

i
think
the
situation
with
the
express
modem
is
inexusable
for
any
business
ive
had
mine
on
order
since
january
apple
finally
called
me
last
week
to
tell
me
that
i
should
have
it
by
the
second
week
of
may
in
the

ive
been
stuck
with
my
without
the

i
needed
it
for
im
sure
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
can
bite
back
at
me
citing
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
apple
is
right
or
at
least
justified
but
im
just
a
crabby
consumer
and
when
i
order
a

thats
the
product
i
expect
oh
well
its
not

its

however
it
is
very
experience
to
buy
a
macintosh
last
winter
i
was

back
to
hong

i
saw
the
price
of

in

is

price
to

a

in

hello
mr
au
i
have
to
disagree
regarding
your
assessment
of
macintosh
in
hong
kong
the
mac
has
a
sizeable
share
of
the
typesetting
market
as
in
the
us
a
local
magazine
next
magazine
similar
to
newsweek
here
uses
the
mac
extensively
i
have
seen
sir
speedy
and
other
franchises
in
hong
kong
equipped
with
macbased
systems
true
the
discount
is
not
as
steep
as
here
because
customers
in
hong
kong
cannot
buy
from
gray
market
nor
are
mac
being
sold
thru
mass
merchandisers
like
apple
does
here
with
the
performa
lin
e
at
this
point
the
sale
of
mac
is
handled
by
one
exclusive
distributor
on
the
other
hand
you
can
always
get
a
pc
clone
or
in
the
earlier
days
illegal
clones
of
the
apple
iie
your
perception
of
the
mac
not
being
too
popular
in
hong
kong
is
simply
because
most
hobbyists
and
users
find
it
much
cheaper
to
go
to
one
of
those
basement
stores
that
sell
pc
clones
with
probably
illegal
copies
of
bios
than
to
pay
for
a
mac
similarly
you
cannot
say
lotus
surely
is
not
well
accepted
in
hong
kong
because
the
sale
is
so
low
may
be
it
is
because
of
all
those
places
in
kowloon
where
illegal
copies
of
lotus
can
be
bought
for
and
for
a
professional
looking
but
illegal
copies
of
the

nubus

im
sure
ive
seen

i
think
that
the
main

is
that
they

more
than
the

in

so
unless

its
not

it

zyxel
strings
i
write
i
recently
got
a
zyxel
modem
its
great
but
im
still
having
some
problems
figuring
out
what
strings
to
use
in
what
applications
i
basically
need
strings
for
zterm
firstclass
client
and
telefinder
client
ive
been
able
to
get
firstclass
and
zterm
working
by
using
another
modems
settings
in
firstclass
and
copying
them
for
zterm
however
it
still
has
problems
zterm
for
example
will
list
error
the
first
time
i
try
dialing
after
starting
the
problem
if
i
cancel
and
try
again
it
works
fine
telefinder
is
even
worse
i
cant
get
it
to
even
wake
up
the
modem
so
if
anyone
uses
a
zyxel
for
any
of
these
programs
id
greatly
appreciate
you
sending
me
the
setup
strings
you
use
thanks
in
advance

i
cant
help
you
with
firstclass
or
telefinder
but
ive
been
using
zterm
and
a
zyxel
for
close
to
two
weeks
now
heres
what
i
did
once
in
zterm
set
hardware
handshaking
on
and
the
bps
rate
to
youve
probably
already
done
this
then
i
typed
atw
the
first
line
sets
the
modem
to
ignore
the
dtr
line
necessary
for
hardware
handshaking
with
most
though
not
all
mac
hardware
handshaking
cables
the
second
stores
this
setting
in
nonvolatile
memory
in
the
modem
so
its
the
default
when
the
modem
starts
in
the
modem
preferences
dialog
i
have
the
modem
initialization
string
set
to
which
just
insures
that
the
stored
setting
is
used
useful
if
starting
zterm
after
using
something
like
the
fax
software
or
macwoof
which
change
the
settings
in
other
ways
alternatively
you
could
leave
the
factory
default
the
way
it
is
and
just
set
the
zterm
initialization
string
to
which
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
if
the
modem
is
always
on
before
you
start
zterm
and
if
other
programs
dont
modify
the
settings
or
would
work
even
if
other
programs
modify
the
modems
settings
i
do
it
the
way
i
do
because
i
sometimes
forget
to
turn
on
the
modem
before
launching
zterm
and
this
way
im
assured
of
having
the
correct
dtr
handling
when
the
modems
powered
up
after
comparing
the
above
strings
with
my
at

how

mail
order
hi
everyone
just
the
other
day
i
ordered
a
vram
chip
for
my
new
lciii
from
mac
connection
they
sent
it
overnight
very
nice
and
i
got
it
installed
and
we
found
that
it
didnt
work
properly
when
you
put
the
computer
in
thousands
mode
the
bottom
of
the
screen
using
the
new
chip
is
all
flickering
and
fuzzy
so
i
called
them
up
and
im
going
to
return
it
for
a
new
one
my
question
is
how
often
does
such
a
thing
happen
with
simm
chips
in
general
do
you
often
find
when
ordering
chips
that
a
large
portion
are
bad
is
this
a
rarity
this
is
the
first
chip
ive
ordered
so
i
have
no
other
experience
in
this
area
im
just
curious
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
type
of
experience
thats
about
it
please
email
me
and
if
people
want
i
can

my
impression

that
there
arent

any
our

is
to

the

is

worth
advice
from

i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
comment
before
me
the
important
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
it
in
my
five
years
of
education
in

field
though
brief
compare
to
alot
of

i
had
to
think
about

did

come
to
believe
that
choosing
cs
because
one
does
not
like

or
choosing

because

does

is
really
doing

inseparable
cs
ce
and
ee
are
all
a
part
of
a
really
great
discipline
and
do
depend
on
each
other
my
advice
is
dont
limit
yourself
but
make
a
decision
based
on
which
major
will
give
you
the
best
opportunities
to
learn
that
of
course
depends
on
the
curriculum
at
your
persective
school
i
would
choose
a
major
that
allows
me
to
explore
as
much
as
possible

i
dont
know
why
the
school
would
make
a

choose

before

hey
you
may
be

interested

occasionally

ive
had
my
duo
for
a
few
weeks
now
and
suffer
from
both
of
the
above
problems
i
reinstalled
my
system
software
twice
in
an
effort
to
combat
the
problems
thinking
they
were
system
software
problems
initially
reinstalling
the
system
seemed
to
help
but
not
anymore
occasionally
when
i
try
to
wake
up
the
duo
i
get
a
solid
screen
of
horizontal
lines
on
the
screen
it
freezes
i
also
get
the
highpitched
hiss
occasionally
but
only
at
startup
ive
called
the
apple
hotline
sosappl
three
times
already
and
finally
they
agreed
something
is
astray
after
my
duos
screen
would
go
dim
and
the
hard
drive
spun
down
by
itselft
and
put
itself
to
sleep
this
problem
only
occured
twice
apple
sent
me
a
box
to
ship
my
duo
to
be
looked
at
in
new
york
but
the
problem
now
is
intermittent
and
i
cant
afford
to
be
without
my

at
this
time
anyone

via

a

of
potential
causes
faulty
applications
faulty
third

modems
memory

system

pram
corruption
and
power

corruption

the

itself
none

are

case
except
the
last
two
maybe
no
applications
were
running
the

software
was
reinstalled
i
have
no
additional

i
have
found
that
clearing
pram
appears
to
help
for
a
while
at
least
hold
down
command
option
p
and
r
on

unfortunately
the
problem
returns
suggesting
that
pram
is
being
corrupted
by
something
system
software
bug
i
dont
have
any
nonissue
inits
in

apparently
the
power
manager
can
be
reset
by
holding
the
reset
and
interrupt
buttons
while
powering
up
apples
advice
but
since
the
duo
does
not
have
an
interrupt
button
im
not
sure
what
they
mean
in
this
case
this
may
also
help
if
someone
can
decipher
apples
advice
for
me
beyond
this
apple
suggest
that
you
should
follow
the
technical
procedures
to
check
the
hardware
of
this
duo
since
so
many
others
appear
to
be
having
the
same
problem
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
has
been
a
system

bug
introduced
somewhere
along
the
line

quite
recently
too

just
hooked
up
my

iisi
to
a
relatively
old
year
asante
ensc
adapter
the
connection
works
like
a
charm
i
installed
the
newest

from
asantes
ftp
server
the
problem
begins
when
i
attach
one
more
device
to
the
scsi
chain
specifically
a
drive
i
power
up
the
drive
then
the
mac
the
mac
tests
memory
etc
just
before
the
happy
mac
face
normally
shows
up
the
power
light
on
the
ensc
goes
out
and
the
boot
process
stops
so
i
can
use
the
network
or
the
external
drive
but
not
both
at
once
this
makes
the
asante
box
pretty
much
unusable
it
doesnt
look
like
a
purely
electrical
scsi
problem
because
if
i
turn
on
the
drive
just
a
second
or
so
too
late
so
that
it
doesnt
get
noticed
during
the
initial
scsi
polling
the
mac
boots
normally
and
the
adapter
works
even
though
the
hard
disk
is
powered
on
and
connected
the
mac
has
never
once
failed
to
boot
from
its
internal
drive
up
to
now
and
ive
had
it
for
over
a
year
here
is
what
i
tried
changing
the
scsi
ids
of
the
ensc
and
the
disk
several
permutations
changing
the
order
of
devices
ie
the
ensc
at
the
head
or
tail
of
the
chain
overterminating
with
an
external
terminator
both
devices
have
internal
ones
underterminating
ie
removing
internal
resistors
from
the
hard
disk
trying
another
ensc
box
trying
another
identical
drive
trying
several
different
scsi
cables
has

you

the

fpu
refers
to
your
option
of
purchasing
the

one
of
the

apple
does
not

whether

did
send

point
sating
that
the
centris
which
only
comes

a
nonfpu
processor
cannot
be
upgraded
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configurations
of
the
two
chips
apparently
do
not

so
you
cannot
swap

interference

second
because

the

it

can
cause
the
interference
you

all
lights
in

rooms
around
the

see
if
that
helps

not

any

i
can

he
doesnt

were
both
running
system
does
anyone
with

the
other
three

i

get

i
sort

lemmings
playing
in

on
that
machine
not
just
on
the
left
channel
i
could
be
mistaken
though
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
quad
and
pb
i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play
in
stereo
if
there
isnt
a
problem
with
our
machines
i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
and
powerbook
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a
rom
problem
if
so

why
wouldnt

they

the

i
i
wanted

it
wont

the

has
been
used
running

kermit
using
both
internal

external

so
i
dont

its
the

when
i
send
a

the

it
responds
with
a
test
of

it
works

not
on

i
thought
that
the

so
is
the

so
i
connected
from

the

still
ng

battery

i
had

handheld
everything
else
worked
okay
on
that
port
but
not
the
hp
it
runs
on
two
penlite
batteries
it
turned
out
that
the
plus
by
accident
or
by
design
flaw
was
putting
a
volt
bias
on
the
serial

that
was
doing
weird
things
to
the

which
has
only

the

worked

does

that

it
i
guess
a

could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pds
but
thats
the
only
place
so
will
it
be
possible
to
have
a
nubus
or
pds
powerpc
upgrade
or
will
it
require
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interesting
for
apple
to
come
out
with
a
nubus
powerpc
that
allowed
use
of
the
cpus
like
rocketshare
but
i
guess
thats
getting
a
bit
fantastic
i
was
wondering
since
macweek
reported
that
developers
were
seeded
with
powerpcs
on
a
nubus
card
also
any
word
on
machine
arrivals
or
estimated
speed
last
i
heard
the
estimates
were
around
times
the
speed
of
a
quadra
in
native
risc
mode
i
heard
an
apple
employee
mumble
something
about
the
arrival
of
powerpc
machines
at
a
much
earlier
date
that
but
i
doubt
its
true
finally
is
the
powerpc
developers
cd
minicourse
available
i
saw
it
advertised
in
the
developers
university
calendar
and
id
like
to
know
if
its
at
all
interesting
sean
seanmcdacdalca
radius
speculated
publicly
that
they
could
provide
a
powerpcbased
rocket
for
existing
macs
it
would
have
the
plus
of
rocketshare
and
the
minus
of
nubus
accelerators
no
true
boot
off
the
accelerator
nubus
bottleneck
to
video
and
other
io
apple
it
seems
will
not
compete
with
third
parties
here
except
perhaps
for
notyetavailable
macs
like
cyclone
where
a
powerpc
slot
might
be
advertised
look
for
daystar
and
such
to
make
powerpc
accelerators
one
potential
problem
with
any
accelerator
though
is
that
it
will
need
a
rom
companion
and
apple
has
licensed
only
radius
with
rocketshare
to
use
any
of
its
proprietary
code
apple
is
between
the
lines
trying
to
let
us
know
that
powerpc
macs
will
have
simplified
logic
boards
due
to
the
magical
nature
of
risc
and
that
these
boards
should
be
much
cheaper
to
build
than
those
in
existing
macs
perhaps
then
well
see
groundbreaking
prices
in
maclogic
board
upgrades
much
the
same
way
weve
seen
much
cheaper
highperformance
cpus
this
year
first
generation
powerpcs
will
also
hopefully
have
socketed
cpus
so
that
theyll
be
chip
upgradeable
to
a
year
later
this
should
be
possible
in
much
the
same
way
that
can
be
pulled
for
clock
doublers
if
there
is
too
much
technical
baggage
which
i
doubt
since
the
external
busses
are
the
same
sizewidth
to
do
this
perhaps
we
can
have
cpu
daughterboard
a
la

as
standard
to
facilitate
better
cpu
upgrades
this
is

still

sell

either

the
most
memory
you

is
either
or

i

if

i
would
be

receive
it
that
way
i
could
play
around
a
bit
and
maybe
get
my

to
do
something
useful
with
its
serial

other
than
appletalk
btw
i
believe
that
when
the
port
stats
says
that
maximum
in

is
bytes
that
that
means
increasing
the
buffer
will
help
if
you
are

hardware
handshaking
i
can
cram
text
data
pretty
fast
into
my

and
can
monitor
that
cts
is
being
lowered

the

never
gets
beyond
out
of

this
is
possible
technically
you
only
need
to
take
out
of
the
vram
simms
but
leaving
in
the

two
will
not
get
you
anything

do

to

yup
you
have
to
take
off
the
power

its
only
a
couple
of
screws
so
you
should
be
ok
just
make

i
know
from
what
weve
discussed
in

that
all
have

the

why
would
they
be
so
unclear
about
this

in
their

i
think
this
is
mostly
the
fault
of
the
people
who
write
up
the
literature
and
price
lists
being
confused
themselves
since
there
are
two
possible
processor
configurations
and
one
of
the
them
doesnt
have
an
fpu
it
does
seem
to
be
an
option
even
though
it
really
isnt
im
planning
to
buy
the
pretty
soon
but
im
now
getting
confused
with
whether
it
comes
with
fpu
or
not
well
then
allow
me
to
end
your
confusion
the
only
come
with
an
in
the
base
configuration
if
you
are
not
getting
this
configuration
then
you
are
getting
an
fpu
why
say
optional
if
its
built
in
good
question
i
have
been
wondering
that
since
feb
if
you
get
the
centris
with
cd
configuration
you
are
getting
a
mac
with
a
processor
that
has
builtin
math
coprocessor
support
my
understanding
is
that
the
optional
fpu
refers
to
your
option
of
purchasing
the
centris
without
fpu
or
one
of
the
other
configurations
with
fpu
this
is
possible
but
an
option
is
something
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
request
when
you
want
it
what
apple
has
done
is
given
the
buyer
a
choice
between
configurations
and
not
an
option
apple
does
not
offer
an
upgrade
from
the
nonfpu
system
to
become
an
fpu
system
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
processor
on
the
nonfpu
system
a
can
be
replaced
with
a
supplied
by
another
vendor
this
is
not
unclear
at
all
in
fact
apple
has
included
in
the
roms
of
those
machines
with
code
to
recognize
the
presence
of
the
full
fpu
and
use
it
thereby
making
the
upgrade
as
easy
as
switching
chips
you
pop
the
out
and
pop
in
a
full
apple
did
send
a
memo
out
at
one
point
sating
that
the
centris
which
only
comes
with
a
nonfpu
processor
cannot
be
upgraded
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configurations
of
the
two
chips
apparently
do
not
match
so
you
cannot
swap
one
for
another
again
according
to
apples
memo
they
did
i
think
i
would
doublecheck
this
it
has
been
stated
countless
times
in
this
newsgroup
by
two
of
the
centris
hardware
designers
that
the

i
am

that
i
may

set
up

apple
has
really
confused
people
with
this
whole

i
think
well
be
answering
this
question
for
about
the
next
year
or
so
there
is
no
option
to
get
an
fpu
on
a
what
you
have
is
a
choice
of
cpus
there
is
the
that
does
not
have
an
integrated
fpu
like
the
full
and
is
only
present
in
the
base
model
of
the
appleusa
and
there
is
the
full
which
you
get
when
you
order
anything
other
than
the
base
configuration
therefore
since
you
have
ordered
one
of
the
versions
with
onboard
ethernet
models
you
will
not
be
getting
the
but
even
if
you
wanted
to
have
the
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
order
a
with
ram
onboard

an
its
not
an
option
also
a
note
to
people
out
there
that
have
and
thinking
that
there
is
an
optional
fpu
the
class
chip
cannot
recognize
an
external
fpu
so
there
is
no
socket
on
the
motherboard
for
a
fpu
chip
and
you
cannot
go
out
and
purchase
an
fpu
on
a
pds
card
or
something
like
that
the
only
way
to
get
an
fpu
in
these
machines
is
to
replace
the
with
a
full

if
you
have

will
not

hi
i
am
working
on
a
project
for
my
marketing
class
and
id
like
to
ask
your
help
the
assignment
is
to
come
up
with
a
product
and
create
a
marketing
plan
for
it
technical
issues
are
not
terribly
important
at
this
point
well
my
groups
plan
is
to
market
a
full
page
monitor
for
laptop
computers
it
would
be
a
thirdparty
product
to
be
installed
by
authorized
repair
centers
like
newer
technologys
palettebook
screen
the
idea
is
that
the
screen
would
fold
in
such
a
way
that
you
would
get
twice
the
screen
height
of
a
normal
screen
remember
technical
issues
aside
in
fact
by
adjusting
the
fold
of
the
screen
and
the
monitor
configuration
you
could
have
regular
or
full
height
the
screen
would
probably
be
monochrome
the
motivation
behind
this
is
that
laptop
computers
seem
to
be
very
popular
among
business
people
business
people
also
commonly
use
word
processing
and
spreadsheet
applications
for
which
it
is
very
convenient
to
see
a
large
portion
of
the
document
because
of
the
target
users
and
applications
color
screens
arent
really
a
neccessity
we
could
hopefully
keep
the
cost
between
and
now
please
dont
write
this
off
as
completely
ridiculous
i
really
need
some
constructive
feedback
so
if
you
would
please
reply
to
me
via
email
and
let
me
know
if
you
would
consider
buying
a
full

laptop
screen
how
much
you
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
it
any
helpful
commentaries
on
the
idea
also
if
you
take
this
idea
and
make
a

machines
all
with

if
the
contents
of
a
window
are
being
calculated
and
updated
a
lot
of
strange
horizontal
lines
are
temporarily
generated
on
the
screen
the
lines
translate
to
the
top
of
the
screen
and
have
a
slightly
lower
brightness
than
their
surroundings
they
are
a
few
millimeters
apart
i
admit
that
they
are
vague
but
they
can
still
be
distinguished
clearly
especially
if
the
environment
ie
the
rest
of
the
room
is
a
bit
dark
applications
which
produce
this
effect
are
the
previewer
of
directtex
ie
dvireader
kaleidagraph
another
program
which
produces
this
effect
is
spyglass
transform
while
contouring
a
big
array
thanks
for
any
information
about
this

i
dont
know
about
the
specific
problem
mentioned
in
your
message
but
i
definitely
had
scsi
problems
between
my
and
my
venerable
jasmine
megadrive
cartridge
stuff
deleted
i
doubt
this
is
a
quadraspecific
problem
i
had
to
get
rid
of
my
venerable
bernoulli
last
year
with
enough
stuff
deleted
might
fix
the
problem
in
my
case
the
cartridges
wouldnt
formatmountpartition
for
aux
all
i
know
is
that
the
megadrives
worked
perfectly
on
both
my
mac
plus
and
my
powerbook
it
was
for
this
reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a
cartridge
from
a
drive
it
would
start
popping
up
dialog
boxes
saying
this
cartridge
must
be
formatted
with
jasmine
driveware
even
though
there
was
no
cartridge
in
the
drive
mark
the
problem
mentioned
last
is
a
known
quadra
scsi
problem
it
was
heavily
discussed
last
year
and
an
apple
employee
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
one
byte
error
in
the
scsi
driver
routine
for
the
quadras
at
least
the
and
system
should
not
have
that
problem
for
most
people
the
solution
was
to
get
an
updated
driver
from
the
drive
manufactor
in
my
case
mass
microsystems
wrote
a
new
driver
which
fixed
the
problem
on
my
quadra
all
that
occured
early
last
year

the

the
consensus
at

was
that
the

would
not
work
there
as
i
will
be
moving
there
this
summer
i
called
apple
to
make
sure
and
they
told
me
today
that
the
iwii
as
bought
in

will
definitely
run
on

as

an
with

which
dates
back

when

originally

i
experienced
the
failure

problem
this
was
fixed
soon
after
by
a

upgrade
on

lately
a
similar

has
been
occuring

flashes
a
few

then
i

however
upon
turing
the

off

on

the

always
boots
up
just
fine
furthermore
if
instead
of
turning
the

off
i
press
the
reboot
button
the
same
problem
occurs
but
as
i
said
turning
the
power
off
and
on
always
works
this
problem
is
different
from
the
boot
problem
in
that
before
it
often
required
several
power
off
and
ons
to
get
it
to
boot
does
anybody
have
any
suggestions
as
to
what
the
problem
is
or
how
it
can
be
fixed
im
wondering
if
its
getting
old
and
requires
more
time
to
come
up
to

now
is
there
a

were
both
running

does
anyone
with

the

i

on

could

i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play

there
isnt
a
problem
with
our
machines
i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
and
powerbook
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a
rom
problem
if
so
though
why
wouldnt
system
patch
over
this
problem

i

its

for
a
quick
explanation
of
mac
sound
the
original
documentation

the

documents
how
to
make
sound
by
directly
accessing
hardware
basically
you
jam
values
into
all
the
even
bytes
from
soundbase
to
this
was
because
of
how
the
mac
and
some
later
machines
generated
sound
was
by
scanning
this
block
and
daing
every
even
byte
the
odd
bytes
went
to
the
floppy
on
some
machines
when
the
mac
ii
and
apple
sound
chip
was
invented
it
was
designed
to
generate
stereo
sound
it
was
also
designed
to
be
compatible
with
we
had
once
documented
so
storing
bytes
at
the
even
values
at
soundbase
meant
i
want
to
play
a
mono
sound
and
so
it
was
emulated
but
apple
had
since
retracted
the
documentation
on
soundbase
and
decided
not
to
document
the
lowest
layers
of
sound
generation
so
apple
never
explained
where
to
stuff
bytes
if
you
want
to
make
stereo
sound
enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
furthermore
people
who
port
from
the
ibm
dont
want
to
learn
more
apis
so
it
has
become
popular
for
game
writers
to
write
to
soundbase
to
make
sound
since
it
is
very
easy
since
the
mac
ii
apple
has
had
many
different
kind
of
sound
output
hardware
and
the
only
things
they
have
in
common
are
that
writing
to
soundbase
works
on
some
hardware
mac
ii
iix
iicx
iici
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
through
both
speakers
on
some
macs
quadra
at
least
writing
to
soundbase
gets
you
mono
sound
on
the
left
channel
only
both
are
technically
correct
interpretations
of
the
original
specification
but
one
is
obviously
preferable
for
asthetic
reasons
if
developers
use
the
sound
manager
and
i
think
the
sound
driver
mono
sounds
will
typically
come
out
through
both
channels
regardless
of
the
underlying
hardware
it
is
possible
to
specify
you
want
to
generate
left
channel
only
but
no
one
does
if
developers
write
to
sound
base
their
games
will
only
come
out
the
left
on
some
games
the
other
problem
the
original
mac
ii
only
producing
left
channel
sound
on
the
internal
speaker
while
the
mixes
both
isnt
really
related
it
is
due
to
the
post
generation
amplification
used
on
the
motherboards
of
the
different
machines
it
only
affects
true
stereo
sounds
sounds
which
are
actually
mono
will
play
on
the
internal
speaker
no
matter
what
machine
you
have
now
to
more
directly
address
the
question
the
games
you
list
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
and
also
hellcats
super
tetris
oxyd
and
many
more
these
are
just
what
ive
tested
cheat
and
write
to
soundbase
and
so
are
only
left
channel
on
quadras
other
games
you
list
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
and
also
pga
tour
golf
civilization
and
more
these
are
again
only
from
personal
experience
use
the
sound
manager
and
work
fine
on
all
machines
the
more
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
really
i
am
absolutely
positively
not
allowed
to
do
what
i
am
about
to
do
but
im
going
say
it
anyway
stop
cheating
on
sound
really
soon
you
will
be
sorry
as
even
those
without
external
speakers
will
be
disappointed
with
your
sound
on
future
hardware
the
grace
period
is
about
to
end
the
sound
manager
is
understandable
now
and
works
pretty
well
and
will
work
even
better
soon
so
use
it
in
conclusion
to
doug
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
at
least
not
a
bug
to
jon
it
isnt
a
choice
to
developers
as
to
whether
they
want
to
send
sound
to
both
channels
if
they
do
it
the
right
way
it
is
taken
care
of
automatically
if
you
cheat
there
is
not
way
to
make
it
work
on
all
hardware

anyway
i
was
hoping
someone
knowledgeable
about

internals
could
set
me
straight
is
it
simply
impossible
for
a
mac
se
to
print
grayscale
or
could
to
use
the
grayscale
features
i
believe
you
need
a
mac
equipped
with
colour
quickdraw
i
was
told
this
somewhere
or
other
but
its
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
mac
se
can
print
grayscale
images
loaded
with
the
proper
software
however
the
mac
se
cannot
display
grayscale

w
g

an
item
saying
that
he
had
bought
a
new
wizzbang
laser
printer
from
apple
a
select
i
think
which
can
print
grayscale
he
then
said
that
he
cannot
print
grayscale
from
his
se
computer
and
also
that
all
the
experts
he
has
dealt
with
agree
that
it
is
not
possible
this
is
the
one
major
bugbear
about
doing
a
party
se
upgrade
compared
to
apples
se
to
upgrade
you
will
never
be
able
to
run
color
quickdraw
it
is
color
quickdraw
that
controls
color
and
grayscale
ses
can
print
some
colour
this
is
because
quickdraw
the
original
noncolour
version
has
the
right
hooks
for
eight
colours
some
of
you
will
remember
the
scsigraph
solution
to
getting
a
colour
screen
for
your
se
i
think
that
it
gave
you
sixteen
colours
by
dithering
or
something
there
is
no
reason
that
apple
couldnt
release
software
patches
for
older
computers
there
are
lots
of
mac
pluses
classics
and
ses
that
have
been
upgraded
to
and
processors
which
should
be
perfectly
able
to
deal
with
color
quickdraw

they
wont
and
parties

a
difficult

just

caveat

if

that
you
would
be

do
so
whatever

were

i
am
pretty

that
the

not

re
monitor
for

jeff
i
have
answers
to
both
of
your
questions
first
i
recommend
the
sony
monitor
it
is
a
trinitron
vga
monitor
but
it
is
designed
specifically
for
use
with
the
lc
it
works
only
with
macs
with
specific
video
capabilities
which
means
only
the

and
anything
after
the
ci
all
it
takes
is
a

i
recommend
one
from
james
engineering
which
is
about
these
cost
about
as
compared
to
the
much
higher
prices
of
comparable
monitors
because
they
are
not
multisynch
i
have
used
one
for
half
a
year
and
i
love
it
second
i
have
used
syex
and
found
them
to
be
decent
i
had
a

i
cancelled
they
were
helpful
in
explaining
the

why
there
were

they
had

was
that
they

return

i

my

finally
gave
up
the
ghost
this
weekend
after
starting
life
as
a
way
back
in
sooo
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
machine
a
bit
sooner
than
i
intended
to
be
im
looking
into
picking
up
a
powerbook
or
maybe
and
have
a
bunch
of
questions
that
hopefully
somebody
can
answer
does
anybody
know
any
dirt
on
when
the
next
round
of
powerbook
introductions
are
expected
id
heard
the
was
supposed
to
make
an
appearence
this
summer
but
havent
heard
anymore
on
it
and
since
i
dont
have

was
wondering
if
anybody
out
there
had
more
info
has
anybody
heard
rumors
about
price
drops

the
powerbook
line
like
the
ones
the

just
went

whats
the
impression

on

could
probably
swing

if
i
got
the

rather
than
the
but
i
dont
really
have
a
feel
for
how
much
better
the
display
is
yea
it
looks
great
in
the
store
but
is
that
all
wow
or
is
it
really
that
good
could
i
solicit
some
opinions
of
people
who
use
the
and
daytoday
on
if
its
worth
taking
the
disk
size
and
money
hit
to
get
the
active
display
i
realize
this
is
a
real
subjective
question
but
ive
only
played
around
with
the
machines
in
a
computer
store
breifly
and
figured
the
opinions
of
somebody
who
actually
uses
the

daily
might
prove

my

the

i
had
to
get
rid

my
venerable
bernoulli
last
year
with
enough
cartridges
purchased
at
each
to
make
the
whole
thing
worth
more
than
my
whole
computer
the
tech
support
guys
at
ocean
microsystems
suggested
that
some
thirdparty
drivers
might
fix
the
problem
in
my
case
the
cartridges
wouldnt
formatmountpartition
for
aux
all
i
know
is
that
the
megadrives
worked
perfectly
on
both
my
mac
plus
and
my
powerbook
it
was
for
this
reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a
cartridge
from
a
drive
it
would
start
popping
up
dialog
boxes
saying
this
cartridge
must
be
formatted
with
jasmine
driveware
even
though
there
was
no
cartridge
in
the
drive
mark
i
have
been
using
the
pli
sony
mo
drive
and
now
a
sharp
color
scanner
using
standard
scsi
cables
and
standard
terminator
on
my
no
problems
if
you
were
using
a
iifx
that
might
be
another
story
make
sure
there
is
only
one
terminator
in
the
cabling
and
it
must
be
at
the
end
some
boxes
have
internal
terminators
some
can
be
switched
out
and
others
are
socketted
these
count
if
the
box
with
internal
terminations
cannot
be
put
on
the
end
to
terminate
the
cabling
they
have
to
be
disabled
ie
switched
out
or
pulled
out
of
their
sockets
if
you
have
boxes
with
internal
terminations
the
terminations
in
one
box
has
to
be
disabled
etc
i
am
sure
that
this
has
been
covered
by
the
experts
my
experience
with
scsi
boxes
that
connect
to

indicates
that
they
must

this

a

drive
for

the

the

is

essentially
i
have
the

anyone
know
of
an
inexpensive

i
can
use
with

all
help

advice
appriciated

calling
all
mac

question
for
those
familiar
with
quadra

i
put
vram
simms
in
my
quadra
in
the
slots
closest
to
the
ram
simm
slots
and
i
got
no
results
whatsoever
i
have
been
told
that
the
builtin
video
should
support
at
least
and
maybe
color
on
a
macintosh
color
display
however
the
monitors
control
panel
still
lists
colors
as
the
highest
possible
does
it
make
any
difference
which
slots
you
put
the
simms
in
do
you
have
to
do
something
to
activate
them
do
you
have

i
remember
someone
mention
about
a

has
anyone
else
heard
anything
about
this
id
be
interested
in
the
cost
per

and
the
approximate
cost
of
the

itself
and
how
they
compare
to
the
bernoulli
i
think
you
must
be
talking
about
the
syquest
code
named
mesa
i
believe
it
is
a
winchester
technology
drive
pretty
much
like
the
other
syquest
drives
in
terms
of
how
it
works
according
to
the
latest
macleak
the
drive
has
a
ms
access
time
mbs
sustained
throughput
these
figures
are
from
memory
so
they
could
be
slightly
off
but
they
give
you
an
idea
of
performance
nonetheless
the
drive
was
originally
released
for
the
pc
and
just
recently
was
released
for
the
mac
world
dont
ask
me
what
the
differences
are
and
through
they
are
currently
in
limited
supply
according
to
a
syquest
rep
they
are
in
the
process
of
ramping
up
for
mass
production
i
have
already
seen
them
advertised
by
a
number
of
manufacturers
in
macleak
including
pli
massmicro
clubmac
and
macwarehouses
poweruser
the
pli
and
massmicro
units
are
priced
at
just
around
the
lesser
name
brands
are
going
for
around
for
an
external
drive
cartridges
which
hold
mb
sell
for
about
each
at
these
prices
the
drives
and

are
cheaper
and
better
performing
than
the
drives
cost
per
megabyte
compares
favorably
with
other
cartridge
drives
and
bernoulli
drives
but
for
large
amounts
of
data
optical
is
still
cheaper
and
more
reliable

even
if

this
becomes
a
problem
if
there
are
several

theres
no
way
for

reliably
determine

the

the

suggested

the

worked
perfectly
on

it

reason
i
assumed
the
problem
had
something
to
do
with
the
quadra
even
with
the
quadra
they
mostly
worked
ok
the
problem
occurred
when
i
ejected
a

from
a

it
would
start
popping
up
dialog
boxes
saying
this
cartridge
must
be
formatted
with

even
though
there
was
no
cartridge
in
the

mark
t
to

i
have
this
confirmed
from

i
work

we

the

is
my

just

hmmm
sounds
vaguely
similar
to
a
problem
i
had
a
long
time
ago
when
i
was
trying
to
use
kermit
i
was
building
a
serial
connection
between
my
duo
and
my
next
i
think
the
problem
was
in
the
handshaking
basically
you
need
to
make
sure
that
the
handshaking
protocol
is
the
same
on
both
sides
a
safe
place
to
start
is
by
selecting
no
handshaking
on
either
end
one
problem
is
that
the
zilog
serial
chip
seems
to
get
permanently
wedged
if
you
talk
to
it
wrong
and
only
a
reset
will
clear
it
i
dont
know
the
specifics
but
this
could
be
a
nonlinearity
that
screws
up
your
attempts
at
debugging
the
system
it
could
very
well
be
that
you
are
doing
things
righteventually
but
one
wrong
move
like
trying
a
bad
handshaking
protocol
can
screw
up
any
further
correct
actions
until
the
next
machine
reset
i
have
wedged
my
mac
and
also
my
next
that
way
now
i
can
send
files
back
and
forth
between
the
duo
and
the
next
without
any
problem
and
at
pretty
high
speeds
too
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
chip
the
pc
uses
but
i
think
the
zilog
is
pretty
standard

re

scsi
problems
attention
mac
quadra
owners
many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
an
example
would
be
a
sony
inch
mo
without
the
special
maccompatible
firmware
installed
one
solution
sometimes
is
to
disable
blind
writes
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
arent
any
problems
with
quadras
and
blind
transfers
trouble
with
blind
transfers
usually
means
the
programmer
screwed
up
the
tibs
or
didnt
test
their
driver
with
the
device
in
question
well
designed
tibs
poll
or
loop
at
every
point
where
delays
of
occur
this
usually
occurs
at
the
first
byte
of
each
block
of
a
transfer
but
some
devices
can
hiccup
in
the
middle
of
blocks
if
this
happens
in
the
middle
of
a
blind
transfer
there
is
the
possibility
of
losing
or
gaining
a
byte
depending
on
which
direction
the
tranfer
was
going
in
anycase
the
scsi
manager
will
eventually
return
a
phase
error
at
the
end
of
the
transaction
because
it
is
out
of
sync
actual
data
loss
would
only
occur
if
the
driver
didnt
pay
attention
to
the
errors
coming
back
note
that
this
effect
is
not
caused
by
anything
actually
on
the
scsi
bus
but
rather
by
the
transfer
loops
inside
the
scsi
manager
the
problem
occurs
when
the
processor
bus
errors
trying
to
access
the
scsi
chip
when
the
next
byte
hasnt
been
clocked
yet
also
note
that

is
dealt

by

you

use

well

at

on

in
the

seems
not

then
only
way
i
can
safely
tell

playing
is
to
inspect
private

in

qhead
i
think
it
was
and
the
only
way
i

the
real
question
here
in
my
opinion
is
what
motorola
processors
running
system
on
a

are
comparable
to
what
intel
processors
running
windows
on
a

how

tasks
compared

my

answer
except
in
a
very
few
cases
i
get
my
butt
kicked
by
the
amiga
sure
there
are
other
considerations
but
it
goes
to
show
you
how
proper
design
from
the
beginning
in
hardware
and
software
can
give
you
great
returns
as
well
as
showing
you
that
if
you
dont
have
a
marketing
department
to
speak
of
no
one
will
care
how
good
your
system
is
im
still
happy
with
my
ci
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
performance
is
so
bad
comparatively
they
could
have
done
multitasking
properly
they
could
have
done
everthing
else
better

apple
didnt

basically
the

constantly

themselves
as
if
the

were
being

sometimes
the

is
able
to
fully
boot

display
the

but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
reboots
again
at

the
frequency
is
as
high
as
several
times
a

i
wonder
if
your
mac
has
those
little
reset

switches
installed
they
are
plastic
devices
that
push
on
the
switches
which
are
inside

those
switches
are
bad
and
need
replacing
i
wish
i
caught
the

the

is
that
the

re

the

is
who
asked
the
original

why
was

broad
are
we
talking
pure
processing
power
what
kind
of

btw
isolated
from

in

are
we

specs
yuck
i
just
finished
a
project
that
involves
realtime
processing
of
serial
data
and
discovered
that
the
programming
interface
assembly
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
power
of
a
cpu
in
a
particular
application
if
what
you
want
to
do
is
easy
to
code
with
the
instruction
set
given
then
not
only
is
it
easy
but
its
cheap
and
quick
if
you
have
to
fake
things
like
resolving
indirection
without
a
lea
instruction
then
your
cycle
count
goes
through
the
roof
well
lets
not
start

war
about
whose
computer
is
better
than
whose
the
orginal
question
was
about
classifying
microprocessors
having
reread

dont

much

can

that
asante
has
come
out
with
this
lciii
pds
ethernet
adapter
with
an
optional
socket
on

board
my
question
is
will
the
fpu
performance
degrade
will
i
put
the
on
the
pds
card
socket
instead
of
on
the
motherboard
itself
intuitively
the
math
coprocessor
should
always
be
placed
close
to
the
cpu
but
i
am
not
sure
how
good
apples
socalled
processordirect
slot
is
when
it
comes
to
throughout
does
anyone
know
the
answer
to
this
or
have
any
experience
with
the
asante
lciii
ethernet
adapter
thanks

i
believe
the
fpu
on
the
lciii
is
always
supposed
to
go
on
the
logic
board
not
in
the
pds
board
i
have
heard
of
crashing
problems
with
pdsbased
fpus
on
the
lciii
asante
may
have
fixed
them
but
why
bother
why
bother
building
an
lciii
card
with
an
fpu
anyway
the
extra
circuitry
gives
the
card
one
more
chance
to
fail
i
say
fpu
on
main

board
in

i
have
a
question
congratulations
youve
come
to
the
right
place
usenet
is
a
wonderful
resource
for
information
ranging
from
basic
questions
how
do
i
lock
a
floppy
disk
to
queries
that
would
make
steve
jobs
himself
run
screaming
from
the
room
in
terror
i
used
resedit
to
remove
resources
init
wdef
and
nvir
from
my
system
file
and
used
the
hex
editor
to
add
code
string
as
a
patch
to
the
sfgetfile
routine
so
the
standard
file
dialog
box
would
be
a
nice
shade
of
mauve
everything
worked
fine
until
i
installed
supercdevblaster
and
now
when
i
use
the
aldus
driver
to
print
from
pagemaker
to
a
linotronic
my
system
hangs
ps
im
running
system
on
a
powerbook
since
the
macintosh
newsgroups
are
medium
to
high
volume
we
ask
that
you
first
peruse
this
faq
list
including
at
least
the
table
of
contents
for
the
other
pieces
of
it
check
any
other
relevant
online
resources
listed
below
in
question
especially
the
faq
lists
for
the
other
macintosh
newsgroups
and
rtfm
read
the
friendly
manual
before
posting
your
question
we
realize
that
you
are
personally
incensed
that
the
system
is
taking
up
fourteen
of
your
newlyinstalled
twenty
megs
of
ram
but
this
question
has
already
made
its
way
around
the
world
three
hundred
times
before
and
its
developing
tired
feet
finally
before
posting
to
any
newsgroup
macintosh
or
otherwise
please
familiarize
yourself
with
the
basic
etiquette
of
usenet
as
described

the
pieces
are
named
as
per
the
last
part
of
the
newsgroup
they
cover
followed
by
faq
eg
systemfaqz
miscfaqz
the
z
means
the
file
is
stored
compressed
so
youll
need
to
ftp
it
in
binary
mode
and
use
either
maccompress
stuffit
deluxe
or
the
unix
uncompress
command
to
decompress
it

at

some
idea
whether
your

is
answered
anywhere
else
in

faq
even
if
you
dont
have
the
other
parts
at

its
not
always
obvious
especially
to
newcomers
where
a
particular

or
comment
should
be
posted

yourself
with
the
faq

in
all
the
major

in
any
of

jaguboxgsfcnasagov
which
newsgroup
should
i
post
to
there
are
no
stupid
questions
but
there
are
misplaced
ones
you
wouldnt
ask
your
english
teacher
how
to
do
the
definite
integral
of
ln
x
between
zero
and
one
would
you
so
dont
ask
the
programmer
newsgroup
why
your
system
is
so
slow
when
microsoft
word
is
in
the
background
ignorance
of
basic
netiquette
is
not
an
excuse
if
you
want
people
to
help
you
you
need
to
learn
their
ways
of
communicating
posting
questions
to
the
proper
newsgroup
will
fill
your
mailbox
with
pearls
of
wisdom
and
maybe
a
few
rotten
oysters
too
posting
to
the
wrong
newsgroup
often
engenders
a
thundering
silence
for
instance
the
most
common
and
glaring
mispost
one
that
seems
as
incongruous
to
dwellers
in
the
macintosh
regions
of
usenet
as
would
a
purple
elephant
to
aleuts
in
the
arctic
asking
a
question
about
networking
anywhere
except
compsysmaccomm
normally
produces
no
useful
responses
posting
the
same
question
to
compsysmaccomm
ensures
that
your
post
is
read
and
considered
by
dozens
of
experienced
network
administrators
and
not
a
few
network
software
designers
please
post
to
exactly
one
newsgroup
do
not
crosspost
if
a
question
isnt
important
enough
for
you
to
take
the
extra
minute
to
figure
out
where
it
properly
belongs
its
not
important
enough
for
several
thousand
people
to
spend
their
time
reading
for
the
same
reason
compsysmacmisc
should
not
be
used
as
a
catchall
newsgroup
the
breakdown
of
questions
between
different
newsgroups
in
this
document
can
also
serve
as
a
reasonable
guide
to
what
belongs
where
specifically
questions
about
productivity
applications
software
you
bought
your
macintosh
to
run
not
software
you
bought
to
make
your
macintosh
run
better
should
go
to
compsysmacapps
unless
the
application
is
covered
in
a
more
specific
newsgroup
communications
programs
games
hypercard
compilers
and
databases
all
have
more
topical
compsysmac
newsgroups
post
questions
about
noncommunications
hardware
including
questions
about
what
software
is
necessary
to
make
particular
hardware
work
to
compsysmachardware
questions
about
macos
system
software
belong
in
compsysmacsystem
questions
about
utilities
and
extensions
normally
belong
in
compsysmacmisc
questions
about
aux
go
to
compunixaux
detailed
questions
about
appletalk
belong
in
compprotocolsappletalk
direct
questions
about
hypercard
to
compsysmachypercard
nonhypercard
programming
questions
and
questions
about
development
environments
should
go
to
compsysmacprogrammer
resedit
questions
may
be
posted
either
to
compsysmacmisc
compsysmacsystem
or
compsysmacprogrammer
but
generally
the
netters
who
inhabit
the
darker
recesses
of
compsysmacprogrammer
are
considerably
more
practiced
at
the
art
of
resource
hacking
a
general
exception
to
the
above
rules
is
that
any
very
technical
question
about
an
application
that
actually
begins
to
delve
into
the
hows
of
a
program
as
well
as
the
whats
recent
example
how
does
writenow
which
is
written
entirely
in
assembly
compare
to
other
word
processors
written
in
high
level
languages
might
be
better
addressed
to
the
programmer
newsgroup
for
sale
and
want
to
buy
posts
should
go
to
compsysmacwanted
and
miscforsalecomputersmac
only
we
understand
that
youre
desperate
to
sell
your
upgraded
mac
to
get
the
for
a
powerbook
but
trust
me
anyone
who
wants
to
buy
it
will
be
reading
compsysmacwanted
political
and
religious
questions
the
mac
is
better
than
windows
is
not
is
too
is
not
is
too
hey
how
bout
the
amiga
what
about
it
is
not
is
too
belong
in
compsysmacadvocacy
anything
not
specifically
mentioned
above
probably
belongs
in
compsysmacmisc
finally
dont
be
so
provincial
as
to
consider
only
the
compsysmac
newsgroups
the
appropriate
forums
for
your
questions
many
questions
about
modems
in
compsysmaccomm
are
much
more
thoroughly
discussed
in
compdcommodems
questions
about
mac
midi
are
often
better
handled
in
compmusic
even
though
its
not
a
macintosh
specific
newsgroup
shop
around
usenets
a
big
place
and
not
everything
relevant
to
the
macintosh
happens
in
compsysmac
someone
just
asked
why
the
system
was
taking
up
sixteen
of
their
twenty
megabytes
of
ram
shouldnt
i
put
my
brilliance
and
wit
on
display
for
the
world
by
posting
the
seventeenth
response
no
frequent
answers
are
just
as
boring
and
uninteresting
as
frequent
questions
unless
you
really
have
something
new
to
add
to
the
traditional
answers
such
as
the
recent
discovery
that
fonts
in
system
could
eat
memory
private
email
is
a
much
better
medium
for
answering
common
questions
like
this
one
you
might
want
to
add
a
mention
of
this
faq
in
your
email
response
and
a
polite
suggestion
that
your
correspondent
read
it
before
posting
future
questions
i
do
read
all
the
newsgroups
covered
here
and
have
written
a
small

ii
that
lets
me
send
pwfaqs
people
with
frequently
asked
questions
the
section
of
this

that
answers
their
question
with
just
the
click
of
a

so
please
dont
feel
obligated
to
respond
to
someone
who
cares
so
little
about
the
answer
to
their

they
cant
be

notes
on

stuffit
is
a
family
of
products
that
use
several
different
compression
schemes
the
freeware
stuffit
expander
will
unstuff
all
of
them
versions
of
stuffit
earlier
than
stuffit
stuffit
classic
unstuffit
and
stuffit
deluxe
and
will
not
unstuff
the
increasing
number
of
files
stuffed
by
stuffit
you
need
to
get
a
more
recent
version
of
stuffit
or
stuffit
expander
stuffit
lite
and
deluxe
consistently
makes
smaller
archives
than
any
other
macintosh
compression
utility
to
allow
maximum
space
for
files
on
the
various
ftp
sites
and
to
keep
netbandwidth
down
please
compress
all
files
you
send
to
anonymous
ftp
sites
with
stuffit
uutool
maccompress
and
suntar
handle
the
popular
unix
formats
of
uuencode
uu
compress
z
and
tar
tar
respectively
the
unix
versions
are
often
more
robust
than
the
mac
products
so
use
them
instead
when
thats
an
option
translators
that
allow
stuffit

to
expand
uuencoded

are
also
available

macutil
is
dik
winters
package
of
unix
utilities
to
decompress
and
debinhex
files
on
a
workstation
before
downloading
them
to
a
mac
since
unix
stores
files
differently
than
does
the
mac
macutil
creates
macbinary
bin
files
which
should
be
automatically
converted
on
download
it
cant
decompress
everything
in
particular
it
cant
decompress
the
new
stuffit
archives
however
if
you
need
only
one
or
two
files
out
of
an
archivefor
instance
if
you
want
to
read

a
few
notes
on
the
compression
formats
bin
these
are
macbinary
files
always
use
a
binary
file
transfer
protocol
when
transferring
them
never
ascii
or
text
most
files
on
the
net
are
stored
as
hqx
instead
only
rascal
stores
most
of
its
files
in
bin
format
most
communications
programs
such
as
zterm
and
mackermit
are
capable
of
translating
macbinary
files
on
the
fly
as
they
download
if
they
know
in
advance
theyll
be
downloading
macbinary
files
image
this
format
is
normally
used
only
for
system
software
so
that
online
users
can
download
files
that
can
easily
be
converted
into
exact
copies
of
the
installer
floppies
instead
of
using
diskcopy
to
restore
the
images
to
floppies
you
can
use
steve
christensens
freeware
utility
mountimage
to
treat
the
images
on
your
hard
disk
as
actual
floppies
inserted
in
a
floppy
drive
mountimage
has
a
reputation
for
being
buggy
so
you
should
have
some
blank
floppies
and
a
copy
of
diskcopy
handy
just
in
case
sea
x
x
sea
files
dont
merit
a
position
in
the
above
table
because
theyre
selfextracting
they
may
have
been
created
with
compact
pro
stuffit
or
even
diskdoubler
but
all
should
be
capable
of
decompressing
themselves
when
doubleclicked
for
some
unknown
reason
alysis
has
chosen
not
to
use
this
industry
standard
designation
for
selfextracting
archives
created
with
their
payware
products
superdisk
and
more
disk
space
instead
they
append
either
x
or
x
to
selfextracting

how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
get
these
programs
is
to
ask
a
human
being
to
copy
them
onto
a
floppy
for
you
if
youre
at
a
university
theres
absolutely
no
excuse
for
not
finding
someone
to
give
you
a
copy
and
if
youre
anywhere
less
remote
than
mcmurdo
sound
chances
are
very
good
that
someone
at
a
computer
center
dealership
or
user
group
can
provide
you
with
a
copy
of
stuffit
once
you
have
stuffit
any
version
you
dont
need
binhex
if
youre
such
a
computer
geek
that
the
thought
of
actually
asking
a
living
breathing
human
being
instead
of
a
computer
terminal
for
something
turns
you
into
a
quivering
mass
of
protoplasmic
jelly
you
can
probably
download
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
from
a
local
bulletin
board
system
if
you
have
religious
objections
to
software
gotten
by
any
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
then
i
suppose
ill
mention
that
you
can
in
fact
ftp
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
though
this
is
by
far
the
hardest
way
to
get
it
ftp
to
wuarchivewustledu
and
login
type
the
word
binary
hit
return
type
cd
mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression
and
hit
return
then
get
and
hit
return
of
course
its
always
possible
that
by
the
time
you
read
this
stuffit
expander
will
have
been
updated
and
the
name
changed
so
if
this
fails
look
for
something
similar
if
youve
ftpd
straight
onto
your
mac
you
should
now
have
a
selfextracting
archive
which
will
produce
a
working
copy
of
stuffit
expander
when
doubleclicked
if
youve
ftpd
to
your
mainframe
or
unix
account
first
you
still
need
to
use
a
modem
program
to
download
it
to
your
mac
just
make
sure
that
the
mac
is
receiving
in
macbinary
mode
and
the
mainframe
is
sending
in
binary
mode
if
you
need
more
details
on
the
last
step
consult
the
faq
list
for
compsysmaccomm
and
the
manuals
for
both
your
mainframe
and
macintosh
telecommunications
software
how
can
i
get
binhex
stuffit
etc
from
a
pc
you
cant
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
get
an
executable
macintosh
file
from
an
ftp
site
onto
a
pc
and
then
onto
your
mac
without
some
software
obtained
by
means
other
than
anonymous
ftp
you
must
beg
borrow
or
steal
the
necessary
software
such
as
binhex
or
stuffit
lite
from
another
person
i
realize
this
may
terrify
those
among
you
who
havent
left
your
parents
basement
since
you
got
an
apple
ii
in
but
eventually
youre
going
to
need
to
link
up
with
some
human
being
other
than
your
mother
though
i
suppose
if
youre
this
much
of
a
nerd
you
could
send
your
mother
out
to
get
it
for
you
while
youre
gathering
your
nerves
for
a
venture
into
the
strange
and
terrifying
world
of
daylight
please
dont
bother
the
net
by
asking
this
question
again
there
simply
is
no
way
to
move
executable
macintosh
programs
from
a
pc
or
other
nonmacintosh
computer
onto
a
mac
without
software
that
is
not
bundled
with
most
macs
troubleshooting
what
to
do
before
posting
when
things
go
wrong
while
the
various
faq
lists
cover
a
lot
of
specific
problems
there
are
far
more
problems
that
arent
covered
here
these
are
a
few
basic
techniques
you
should
follow
before
asking
for
help
you
should
probably
also
perform
the
tenstep
preventative
maintenance
routine
described
in
section
four
especially
rebuilding
the
desktop
and
resizing
the
system
heap
following
these
steps
may
or
may
not
solve
your
problem
but
it
will
at
least
make
it
easier
for
others
to
recommend
solutions
to
you
identify
the
problem
microsoft
word
is
crashing
doesnt
say
much
what
were
you
doing
when
it
crashed
can
you
repeat
the
actions
that
lead
to
the
crash
the
more
information
you
provide
about
the
actions
preceding
the
crash
the
more
likely
it
is
someone
can
help
you
the
more
precisely
youve
identified
the
problem
and
the
actions
preceding
it
step
the
easier
it
will
be
to
tell
if
the
following
steps
fix
the
problem
for
example
sometimes
quarkxpress
crashes
with
a
coprocessor
not
installed
error
is
not
nearly
as
helpful
as
quarkxpress
crashes
when
i
link
two
text
boxes
on
a
master
page
when
copies
of
those
text
boxes
already
contain
text
the
former
will
leave
you
wondering
whether
the
bug
remains
after
a
given
step
the
latter
lets
you
go
right
to
the
problem
and
see
if
its
still
there
or
not
read
the
read
me
file
many
companies
include
a
list
of
known
incompatibilities
and
bugs
in
their
read
me
files
often
these
arent
documented
in
the
manual
read
any
read
me
files
to
see
if
any
of
the
problems
sound
familiar
check
for
viruses
run
disinfectant
or
another
antiviral
across
your
disk
virus
infections
are
rarer
than
most
people
think
but
they
do
occur
and
they
do
cause
all
sorts
of
weird
problems
when
they
do
reinstall
the
application
and
all
its
support
files
for
half
a
dozen
reasons
external
magnetic
fields
improperly
written
software
the
alignment
of
the
planets
a
file
on
a
disk
may
not
contain
the
data
its
supposed
to
contain
this
can
cause
all
types
of
unexplained
unusual
behavior
restoring
from
original
masters
will
normally
fix
this
reinstall
the
system
software
bits
are
even
more
likely
to
get
twiddled
in
the
system
file
than
in
the
application
and
the
effects
can
be
just
as
disastrous
see
question
for
a
detailed
procedure
for
performing
a
clean
reinstall
if
the
problem
continues
to
occur
after
youve
taken
these
steps
chances
are
youve
found
either
a
conflict
between
your
application
and
some
other
software
or
a
genuine
bug
in
the
program
so
its
time
to
isolate
the
problem
you
need
to
find
the
minimal
system
on
which
the
problem
will
assert
itself
here
are
the
basic
steps
of
isolating
the
cause
of
a
system
or
application
crash
a
run
only
one
application
at
a
time
occasionally
applications
do
conflict
with
each
other
if
the
problem
does
not
manifest
itself
without
other
applications
running
simultaneously
you
can
begin
launching
other
applications
until
you
find
the
one
that
causes
the
crash
b
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
multifinder
if
youre
running
system
allot
as
much
memory
to
the
application
as
you
can
afford
sometimes
programs
just
need
more
memory
especially
when
performing
complicated
operations
c
if
youre
running
system
turn
off
virtual
memory
and
addressing
theres
still
an
awful
lot
of
system
hostile
software
out
there
including
some
from
companies
that
really
have
no
excuse
can
you
say
microsoft
word
boys
and
girls
i
knew
you
could
some
of
this
software
only
expresses
its
incompatibilities
when
certain
uncommon
actions
are
taken
d
boot
from
a
virgin
system
floppy
if
the
problem
disappears
you
likely
have
an
init
conflict
you
need
to
progressively
remove
extensions
until
the
problem
vanishes
use
a
little
common
sense
when
choosing

either
remove

perform
a

by

half
of

at

once
the

disappears
add
half
of
the
most
recently
removed

until
youve
narrowed
the
conflict
down
to
one

youve
found
the
offending

restart
with
only
that
init
enabled
just
to
make
sure
that
it
and
it
alone
is
indeed
causing
the

contact
technical

have
a

in

if
you
dont
use
the
functionality
of
an

at
least
every
fifth
time
you
boot
up
youre
probably
better
off
not
storing
it
in
your
system
folder
where
it
only
takes
up
memory
destabilizes
your
system
and
slows
down

the

certain

that

does
not

is
the
date

but
since

notoriously
inaccurate
youll
probably
want
to

this
opportunity
to

resize
the
system
heap
even
after
rethinking
their
extensions
as
per
step
two
most
people
still
have
at
least
half
a
row
of
icons
march
across
the
bottom
of
their
screen
every
time
they
restart
all
these
extensions
and
most
applications
too
need
space
in
a
section
of
memory
called
the
system
heap
if
the
system
heap
isnt
big
enough
to
comfortably
accommodate
all
the
programs
that
want
a
piece
of
it
they
all
start
playing
king
of
the
mountain
on
the
system
heap
knocking
each
other
off
to
get
bigger
pieces
for
themselves
and
trying
to
climb
back
on
after
they
get
knocked
off
all
this
fighting
amongst
the
programs
severely
degrades
system
performance
and
almost
inevitably
crashes
the
mac
if
youre
using
system
your
macintosh
will
automatically
resize
the
system
heap
as
necessary
but
if
youre
running
system
its
important
to
set
your
system
heap
size
large
enough
to
manage
all
your
extensions
and
applications
by
default
this
size
is
set
to
way
too
small
for
most
macs
with
any
extensions
at
all
the

size
is
stored
in
the
normally
noneditable

of

bill
steinbergs
freeware

bootman
not
only
lets
you
resize
your
system
heap
but
even
checks
how
much
memory
your

is
already
using
so
it
can
tell
how
much
needs
to
be
allocated
if
youre
running

get

use
it
and
be
amazed
at
how
infrequently
your
macintosh
crashes
reinstall
the
system
software
system
files
can
become
corrupt
and
fragmented
especially
if
youve
stored
lots
of
fonts
and
desk
accessories
inside
them
merely
updating
the
system
software
will
often
not
fix
system
file
corruption
i
recommend
doing
a
clean
reinstall
heres
how
boot
from
the
installer
floppy
of
your
system
disks
copy
any
nonstandard
fonts
and
desk
accessories
out
of
your
system
file
into
a
temporary
suitcase
trash
the
system
file
on
your
hard
disk
also
trash
the
finder
multifinder
da
handler
and
all
other
standard
apple
extensions
like
control
panel
and
chooser
these
will
all
be
replaced
in
the
new
installation
if
youre
running
or
installing
system
move
everything
in
the
extensions
control
panels
and
preferences
folders
into
the
top
level
of
the
system
folder
rename
the
system
folder
any
name
other
than
system
folder
is
fine
doubleclick
the
installer
script
on
your
system
disk
then
choose
customize
select
the
appropriate
software
for
your
model
mac
and
printer
you
could
do
an
easy
install
instead
but
that
will
only
add
a
lot
of
extensions
and
code
you
dont
need
that
waste
your
memory
and
disk
space
once
installation
is
finished
move
everything
from
the
temporary
folder
you
created
in
step
into
the
new
system
folder
if
youre
asked
if
you
want
to
replace
anything
you
forgot
to
take
something
out
in
step
youll
need
to
replace
things
individually
until
you
find
the
duplicate
piece
reinstall
any
fonts
or
das
you
removed
in
step
reboot
you
should
now
have
a
clean
defragmented
system
file
that
takes
up
less
memory
and
disk
space
and
a
much
more
stable
system
overall
disk
utilities
much
like
system
files
hard
disks
have
data
structures
that
occasionally
become
corrupted
affecting
performance
and
even
causing
data
loss
apple
includes
disk
first
aid
a
simple
utility
for
detecting
and
repairing
hard
disk
problems
with
its
system
disks
its
also
available
for
anonymous
ftp
from
ftpapplecom
in
the
directory
dtsmacsyssofthdsc
even
if
you
have
an
earlier
version
you
should
get
the
latest
version
from
ftpapplecom
and
run
it
on
all
your
hard
disks
several
companies
have
released
payware
disk
utilities
that
detect
and
repair
considerably
more
problems
than
disk
first
aid
though
interestingly
none
of
them
detect
and
repair
everything
that
disk
first
aid
does
the
three
most
effective
for
general
work
are
central
points
mactools
deluxe
fifth
generations
public
utilites
and
symantecs
norton
utilities
for
the
macintosh
a
department
or
work
group
should
have
all
of
these
as
well
as
disk
first
aid
since
none
of
them
fix
everything
the
others
do
for
individuals
mactools
street
is
about
half
the
price
of
norton
street
or
public
utilities
street
so
features
and
ease
of
use
being
roughly
equal
i
recommend
mactools
all
of
these
products
occasionally
encounter
problems
they
cant
fix
when
that
happens
its
time
to
backup
and
reformat
backing
up
this
is
one
part
of
preventative
maintenance
that
should
be
done
a
lot
more
often
than
every
three
months
the
simplest
back
up
is
to
merely
copy
all
the
files
on
your
hard
disk
onto
floppies
or
other
removable
media
if
you
keep
your
data
files
separate
from
your
application
and
support
files
then
its
easy
to
only
back
up
those
folders
which
change
frequently
nonetheless
every
three
months
you
should
do
a
complete
backup
of
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
programs
are
available
to
make
backing
up
easier
apple
included
a
very
basic
full
backup
application
with
system
with
the
performas
apple
ships
a
new
apple
backup
utility
that
can
backup
the
entire
disk
or
just
the
system
folder
onto
floppies
the
previously
mentioned
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mactools
deluxe
include
more
powerful
floppy
backup
utilities
that
incorporate
compression
and
incremental
backups
finally
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
have
a
tape
drive
network
server
or
removable
media
device
to
use
for
backups
you
should
check
out
the
more
powerful
payware
utilities
redux
street
doesnt
support
tape
drives
and
diskfit
pro
street
there
are
no
freely
available
backup
utilities
other
than
the
old
hd
backup
from
system
disk
defragmentation
as
disks
fill
up
it
gets
harder
and
harder
to
find
enough
free
space
in
the
same
place
to
write
large
files
therefore
the
operating
system
will
often
split
larger
files
into
pieces
to
be
stored
in
different
places
on
your
hard
disk
as
files
become
more
and
more
fragmented
performance
can
degrade
there
are
several
ways
to
defragment
a
hard
disk
the
most
tedious
but
cheapest
method
is
to
backup
all
your
files
erase
the
hard
disk
and
you
might
as
well
reformat
while
youre
at
it
see
question
and
restore
all
the
files
a
number
of
payware
utilities
including
norton
utilities
for
the
mac
and
mac
tools
deluxe
can
defragment
a
disk
in
place
ie
without
erasing
it
although
the
ads
for
all
these
products
brag
about
their
safety
once
youve
bought
the
software
and
opened
the
shrinkwrap
they
all
warn
you
to
back
up
your
disk
before
defragmenting
it
in
case
something
does
go
wrong
there
are
no
freeware
or
shareware
disk
defragmenters
so
please
dont
annoy
the
net
by
asking
for
one
reformat
your
hard
disk
just
as
a
floppy
disk
needs
to
be
initialized
before
use
so
a
hard
disk
must
be
formatted
before
it
can
hold
data
you
dont
need
to
reformat
every
three
months
but
when
your
system
is
crashing
no
matter
what
you
try
reformatting
is
the
ultimate
means
of
wiping
the
slate
clean
reformatting
your
hard
disk
may
even
gain
you
a
few
extra
megabytes
of
space
not
all
hard
disks
are
created
equal
some
can
hold
more
data
than
others
to
facilitate
mass
production
and
advertising
without
a
lot
of
asterisks
megabytes
is
the
average
formatted
capacity
your
mileage
may
vary
apple
often
formats
drives
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
drive
capacity
when
you
reformat
theres
no
reason
at
all
not
to
reclaim
whatever
unused
space
apples
left
on
your
disk
unlike
floppies
hard
disks
need
a
special
program
to
initialize
them
most
hard
disks
come
with
formatting
software
apples
disks
and
system
software
ship
with
hd
sc
setup
a
minimal
disk
formatter
which
will
format
apple
brand
hard
drives
only
most
other
manufacturers
ship
appropriate
formatting
software
with
their
hard
drives
normally
this
will
be
all
you
need
to
reformat
your
hard
disk
a
number
of
generalpurpose
formatters
are
also
available
which
go
beyond
the
bundled
software
to
include
features
like
encryption
password
protection
multiple
partitioning
faster
disk
access
system
compatibility
and
even
compression
two
of
the
best
are
the
payware
and
hard
disk
toolkit
personal
edition
street
for
either
while
there
are
one
or
two
freeware
formatters
available
none
are
likely
to
be
superior
to
the
ones
bundled
with
your
hard
disk
powerbook
users
should
be
sure
to
turn
off
sleep
and
processor
cycling
before
reformatting
their
hard
drives
no
matter
what
software
they
use
otherwise
disk
corruption
crashes
and
data
losses
are
a
very

monitor
jitter
several
weeks
ago
i
described
a
problem
with
my
apple
highresolution
monitor
and
promised
to
summarize
replies
received
by
email
to
recapitulate
occasionally
every
two
or
three
hours
or
so
my
monitor
momentarily
loses
sync
the
entire
raster
image
bounces
down
about
an
eighth
of
an
inch
or
so
then
rights
itself
this
usually
happens
right
after
i
close
a
large
window
highlight
a
large
area
or
do
something
that
radically
alters
the
image
on
the
screen
sometimes
though
it
happens
with
no
provocation
whatsoever
i
have
received
a
bewildering
range
of
replies
at
one
extreme
was
a
man
clearly
quite
knowledgable
about
monitors
who
said
that
the
problem
was
that
the
monitors
power
supply
simply
couldnt
always
keep
up
with
sudden
changes
of
the
raster
image
the
rapid
change
from
a
largely
light
screen
to
a
largely
dark
one
overtaxed
the
monitors
power
supply
there
was
no
fix
available
he
said
because
nothing
was
really
wrong
i
guess
he
meant
that
the
flaw
was
so
fundamental
that
it
had
to
be
endured
this
seemed
quite
persuasive
and
i
would
have
been
tempted
to
adopt
an
attitude
of
stoicism
except
for
a
reply
from
a
monitor
owner
who
discovered
that
this
very
problem
is
documented
in
the
apple
service
technical
procedures
volume
under
the
heading
jitter
correction
the
section
describes
a
fix
involving
the
replacement
of
a
capacitor
the
adjustment
of
a
potentiometer
or
failing
that
the
swap
of
a
circuit

sure
there
are
other
considerations
but
it
goes
to
show
you
how
proper
design
from
the
beginning
in
hardware
and
software
can
give
you
great
returns
as
well
as
showing
you
that
if
you
dont
have
a
marketing
department
to
speak

no
one
will
care
how
good
your

is
ive
had
the
same
experience
actually
i
love
the
mac
interface
and
any
number
of
the
features
but
am
sorely
dissapointed
with
the
speed
i
use
macs
daily
and
am
a
moc
consultant
for
osu
statistics
department
im
familiar
with
almost
every
model
out
there
and
my
experience
is
that
both
the
amiga
and
the
atari
st
simply
blow
the
mac
out
of
the
water
in
terms
of
performance
at
this
time
i
would
in
general
say
that
the
other
advantages
of
the
mac
outweigh
the
advantages
of
the
amiga
or
the
st
and
falcon
but
i
really
wish
apple
would
get
their
heads
together
on
speed
they
could
take
a
real
lesson
in
mulitasking
from
the
amiga
os
or
the
multitos
in
the
atari
falcons
too
im
still
happy
with
my
ci
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
performance
is
so
bad
comparatively
they
could
have
done
multitasking
properly
they
could
have
done
everthing
else
better
but
apple
didnt
of
course
dos
and
windows
are
nothin
to
write
home
about
either
i
just
hope
that
someone
comes
out
with
a
machine
that
does
everything
well
someday
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
go
with
mac
in
most
aspects
but
add
the
speed
and
superior
multitasking
of
the
other
platforms
as
for
the
original
topic
trying
to

just
the

seems
almost
worthless

important
users
only
we
are
having
problems
with
a
bunch
of
in
one
of
our
labs
the
fault
is
that
the
machines
either
bomb
or
freeze
when
attempting
to
write
to
their
internal
floppies
the
internal
floppies
have
been
tested
on
their
own
and
are
fine
which
means
that
it
is
a
main

fault
the
machines
all
come
from
the
same
batch
the
date
code
on
the
back
of
the

is
december
do
you
own
a
machine
from
this
batch
has
any
user
had
experience
with
this
fault
was
it
a

repair
any
feedback
would
be

i
believe
the

the
one
primary
difference
is
that
the

enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
the
sound
driver
is
pretty
ok
since
its
fast
sound
manager
used
by
the
book
is
useless
disposing
of
sound
channels
as
soon
as
sound
has
completed
is
out
of
the
question
for
games
with
smooth
animation
its
too
slow
why
would
you
dispose
a
channel
if
you
are
going
to
play
more
sounds
soon
if
you
are
trying
to
write
a
game
you
shouldnt
be
using
sndplay
instead
make
a
channel
and
use
buffercmds
to
play
sounds
on
it
it
works
great
you
can
add
callbacks
to
the
channel
also
to
let
you
know
when
the
channel
is
getting
empty
before
it
gets
empty
the
sound
driver
is
so
much
snappier
than
sound
manager
unfortunately
system
supports
it
poorly
making
programs
crash
occasionally
the
moral
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
well
i
want
my
code
to
work
on
old
systems
too
i
dont
know
about
sys
but
at
least
on
there
are
bugs
in
the
sound
manager
that
causes
channels
to
hang
with
no
error
message
this
happends
when
i
keep
a
channel
open
for
long
periods
necessary
for
performance
and
play
many
sounds
stopping
sounds
halfway
callbacks
seems
not
to
be
reliable
then
only
way
i
can
safely
tell
if
a
sound
has
stopped
playing
is
to
inspect
private
variables
in
the
channel
qhead
i
think
it
was
and
the
only
way
i
have
found
to
tell
if
a
channel
is
hung
is
to
inspect
an
undocumented
flag
and
modify
it
callbacks
are
very
reliable
i
found
them
reliable
even
under
system
i
was
doing
continuous
background
sound
with
interrupting
sound
effects
on
system
with
the
imv
documentation
you
probably
were
cancelling
your
callback
commands
out
of
your
channels
of
course
you
didnt
get
called
in
general
if
you
have
problems
with
sounds
working
when
you
play
one
per
channel
and
then
close
the
channel
with
the
related
slowdown
but
then
when
you
play
more
than
one
you
dont
work
then
you
are
adding
more
than
one
synthesizer
to
a
channel
possibly
the
same
one
multiple
times
this
might
be
because
you
are
calling
sndplay
on
a
preexisting
channel
with
a
sound
resource
which
adds
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
the
channel
first
thing
before
it
plays
most
sampled
sounds
have
this
command
at
the
start
of
them
you
need
to
resedit
the
sound
and
remove
that
command
then
when
you
create
your
channel
specify
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
be
the
channels
synth
then
you
can
use
asynch
sndplays
all
you
want
youll
probably
want
to
switch
to
buffercmds
since
you
are
going
to
have
to
use
snddocommand
anyway
to
add
callbacks
now
before
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
i
am
full
of
it
and
the
sound
manager
doesnt
work
for
games
remember
spectre
uses
it
and
it
works
great
if
spectre
can
spare
the
cpu
time
you
can
too
one
little
disclaimer
there
are
some
out
there
who
say
the
sound
manager
in
the
iisi
cant
be
made
to
work
right
im
not
sure
either
way
but
i
know
for
sure
that
you
can
make
your
sounds
work
correctly
on
every
other
machine
using
the
sound
manager

take

there
has
been
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
the
first
statement
true
there
is
a
power
surge
at
startup
that
has
the
potential
to
do
damage
but
the
internal
power
supply
is
wellprotected
ive
turned
my
mac
on
and
off
six
or
seven
times
a
day
for
three
years
without
problem
the
monitor
is
the
same
to
leave
it
on
is
to
waste
a
lot
of
electricity
twice
as
much
as
a
television
possibly
more
turn
it
off
when
youre
not
using
it
itll
save
you
money
and
the
world
a
few
more
resources
the
problem
with
turing
your
computer
on
and
off
constantly
is
not
due
to
the
power
surge
at
start
up
it
is
due
to
thermal
fatigue
you
turn
on
your
computer
it
heats
up
and
everything
expands
you
turn
it
off
it
cools
off
and
everything
contracts
there
is
a
limited
number
of
cycles
of
this
that
any
component
can
take
before
it
fails
modern
electronics
are
much
more
robust
in
this
respect
than
their
predeccesors
in
fact
portable
computers
are
designed
with
this
in
mind
since
the
sleep
function
that
extends
battery
life
also
greatly
increaces
the
number
of
thermal
cycles
that
occur
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
i
am
not
going
to
use
my
computer
and
this
includes
the
monitor
in
the
next
hours
i
turn
it
off
i
always
dim
the
monitor
when
not
in
use
to
prolong
the
life
of
the
phosphor
i
tend
to
think
that
with
the
pace
of
technical
innovation
in
the
computer
industry
you
should
be
much
less
concerned
with
the
fatigue
life
of
your
equipment
and
more
concerned
with
how
long
your
particular
architecture
will
be
supported
by
hardware
and
software
vendors

re

should
they

kept

a

yes
i

computers

should

what
about

they
generate

should
i
or

a

any
advice
thanks
take
carepaul
there
has
been
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
the
first
statement
true
there
is
a
power
surge
at
startup
that
has
the
potential
to
do
damage
but
the
internal
power
supply
is
wellprotected
ive
turned
my
mac
on
and
off
six
or
seven
times
a
day
for
three
years
without
problem
the
monitor
is
the
same
to
leave
it
on
is
to
waste
a
lot
of

twice
as
much
as

possibly
more
turn

appeared
on

what
is

the

wonderd
if
this

much

i
am
curious
i

is
testing
out
as

stable
at

your
mileage
may
vary
the
top
speed
you
achieve
cannot
be
predicted
before
hand
my
personal
has
tested
fine
up

thus
far
i
didnt
have
higher

you

speed
the
original
one
is

i
recommend
getting

remove
it
taking
care
not

a

is

here
remove
the
tower
assembly
by
pulling
medially
the
plastic
tab
on
the
right
side
of
the
tower
this
tab
prevents
the
tower
from
sliding
posteriorly
slide
the

assembly
cm
posteriorly
then
lift
the

assembly
straight
up

remove

pull
the

the

lift
the

about
mm
this

slide

the
motherboard
then
comes
directly
out
locate
the
mhz
clock
crystal
it
is
a
small
metal
box
near
the
cpu
chip
note
and
remember
its
orientation
the
new
clock
oscillators
must
be
aligned
with
pin
in
the
same
orientation
very
carefully
desolder
and
remove
the
old
clock
oscillator
some
of
the
pins
may
be
bent
over
simply
desolder
then
unbend
them
be
sure
your
desoldering
iron
is
hot
enough
before
heating
the
board
i
used
a
suction
desoldering
iron
to
accomplish
this
task
this
is
not
appropriate
for
a
first
soldering
experience
the
motherboard
is
a
multilayer
design
with
very
fine
traces
easily
damaged
without
proper
care
install
your
socket
or
socket
pins
where
the
old
oscillator
once
was
put
a
mhz
clock
oscillator
into
the
new
socket
you
could
use
the
old
clock
but
it
has
solder
on
its
pins
this
may
come
of
inside
the
socket
and
cause
corrosion
problems
later
i
suggest
using
a
new
mhz
clock
install
your
cooling
fan
system
to
complete
the
modification
reinsert
the
motherboard
and
slide
it
into

snap
in
the

switch
assembly
and
speaker
to
lock
the

board
firmly
plug

reinstall

placing

against
the

of
the

with
the

assembly
about
cm
posterior

position
lower
the
tower
assembly
into

while
maintaining
contact
with
the

once
fully
down
slide
the

assembly
anteriorly
until
it
clicks

reconnect
the

make
the

if

something

immediately
turn
of
the
power
and
recheck
your
handiwork
if
all
is
not
well
you
have
my
sincere
condolences
hopefully
all
will
work
normally
turn
the
machine
back
off
and
replace
the
mhz
clock
oscillator
with
a
faster
one
reboot
and
be
astounded
you
will
need
to
fully
test
the
machine
for
many
hours
before
deciding
a
particular
speed
is
truly
usable
with
my
vso
a

lockup

i
have
replaced
the
osz
to

yesterday
and
no
truble
at
all
my

now
works
at

stable
for
more

hours
i
have
also
tried
a

but
after
hour
my
quadra
died
i
am
not
sure
what
was
the
reason
for
that
but
it
is
to
risky
to
run
it
to
fast
most
of
your
quadras
should
work
at
mhz
without
any
problems
but
a
safety
tip
do
a
backup
from
your
harddisk
befor
you
start
to
upgrade
during
my
mhz
test
i
damaged
my
harddisk
and
had

the

run
at

the
next
part
which

are
the

rams

have

you

it
isnt

to

most
of
the

on

running

question
is
do

sink
i
would
say
no
after
running

for
more

hours
the
heat
sink
is
really
cool
a
mhz
with
heat
sink
is
mutch
warmer

i
didnt

you
living

i
wonder
how
hard
it
would
be
ie
what
it
would
add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machines
with
a
power
saver
feature
built
in
which
would
reduce
power
consumption
automatically
if
the
machine
is
idle
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
this
is
pretty
standard
in
portable
machines
and
the
same
kinds
of
tricks
could
be
played
spinning
down
disks
turning
off
screens
reducing
clock
speed
etc
the
advantage
of
this
over
just
turning
the
thing
off
would
be
you
dont
have
to
remember
to
do
anything
and
the
machine
is
still
available
over
the
network
the
tricky
part
might
be
in
defining
what
constitutes
inactivity
certainly
you
dont
want
to
wake
up
from
sleep
mode
just
because
somebody
pinged
you

you
do
want

wake

somebody
logs

a

i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
about
wasting
electricity
in
the

that

getting
turned
into

it
may
not
be
as
efficient
a
way
to
heat

as
the

but
its
not
too
bad
in

summer
though
its

only
are
you
wasting
that

probably
also

well
i
dont
exaclty
know
what
should
be
done
but
what
i
do
is
keep
my
cpu
on
and
turn
my
monitor
off
when
not
in
use
i
do
this
as
much
for
easing
power
consumption
as
anything
though
turning
off
the
monitor
when
not
in
use
has
the
advantage
of
requiring
less
ram
than
a
screen
saver
but
it
requires
more
of
my
memory
to
remember
to
turn
it
off
pretty

re
monitors
should
they
be
kept
on
hours
a
day
i
wonder
how
hard
it
would
be
ie
what
it
would
add
to
the
cost
to
design
desktop
machines
with
a
power
saver
feature
built
in
which
would
reduce
power
consumption
automatically
if
the
machine
is
idle
for
more
than
some
amount
of
time
i
believe
that
apple
sun
and
a
number
of
other
desktop
machine
manufacturers
have
agreed
with
the
government
to
incorporate
powersaving
techniques
this
is
also
something
that
governments
in
other
countries
are
likely
to
require
in
the
future
so
expect
to
see
it
this
may
include
the
ability
for
the
system
to
fully
power
down
the
monitor
via
a
controllable
power
outlet
and
power
it
back
on
automatically
is
this
a
sell
on
screen
saver
software
companies
goals
for
idle
power
consumption
have
been
set
at
something
like
watts
for
the
system
not
including
the
monitor
dont
quote
me
on
this
note
that
in
many
businesses
the
savings
will
be
substantial
especially
if
you
factor
in
reduced
load
on
air
conditioning
systems
sun
did
a
study
that
indicated
that
simply
powering
off
monitors
for
the
night
would
save
the
company
sun
itself
on
the
order
of
per
year
putting
other
and
automatic
powersaving
features
in
would
probably
have
greater
than
double
that
value
given
that
we
are
seeing
more
and
more
reason
to
leave
our
work
and
home
computers
on
getting
faxes
automatically
getting
email
building
power
consumption
control
into
all
machines
has
a
potential
to
cut
off
the
national
power
consumption
based
on
data
i
heard
btw
when
encouraging
employees
to
power
off
monitors
when
leaving
work
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
should
only
be
done
with
monitors
with
the
power
switch
on
front
there
was
some
indication
that
monitors
with
power
switches
on
the
rear
are
not
designed
to
tolerate
lots
of
power
cycling
this
may
only
apply
to
the
monitors
we
use
but
might
be
worth
checking
if
you
happen
to
have
a
monitor
with
the
switch
in
back

you

this

that

placed
vertically
with
no

problems
so
is
there
any
problems
putting
a

formatted
vertically
on

i
got
a

a

with
the

have
used
it

i
can

it

i
would
really
like
to
lay
it
flat

put

this
is
probably
not
a

it

when

it
was

see

this
it
seems
to
me
that
hp
backgrounder
is
quitting
unexpectedly
and
that
its
status
as

not

allows
it
to
do
this
without

restarted
reloaded
hp

i
was
able

put
my

just
a

preventing

slow

this
happens
intermittently
to

in

i
can
end
the

immediately
by
unplugging
the

it
seems
that
something

puts

these

have
the

thank
you
very

these

behave

my

i

how

all

that
done

my

to
my

who
is

my

this
what

the
apple
monitor
does
it
come
with
two
types
as
i

one
can
hook
up
the
power
cord
of
an
apple
monitor
to
the
back
of
a
machine
such
as
my
quadra
however
for
my
fathers
there
is
no
extra
plug
which
allows
use
of
the
power
supply
he
needs
to
plug
it
into
the
socket
separately
sodoes
the
monitor
come
with
a
cable
that
will
allow
him
to
do
this
will
have
to
buy
a
different
cable
if
yes
where
can
he
purchase
such
a
cable
or
apple
kind
enough
to
provide
both
types
of
cables

longshort
follows
the
origional
poster
asked
if
heshe
could
use
any
old
vgasvga
monitor
with
a
centris
hence
title
the
answer
ot
this
question
is
an
unqualified
yes
you
can
use
any
old
vgasvga
monitor
with
a
centris
you
do
need
an
adaptor
i
use
a
mac
vgaq
from
james
engineering
to
run
between
the
two
machines
the
adaptor
i
have
mentioned
will
convert
a
centris
to
a
three
row
vgasvga
pin
adaptor
for
your
monitor
now
the
special
interest
disclaimer
the
above
answer
is
correct
for
using
a
vga
monitor
at
resolution
if
your
monitor
will
sync
to
horizontal
the
above
adaptor
will
allow
you
to
choose
resolution
i
prefer
this
on
my
then
you
have
the
question
of
matching
adaptors
and
sync
rates
i
would
advocate
calling
james
engineering
because
they
seem
to
have
a
clue
as
to
the
comment
by
the
person
who
said
dont
bother
calling
apple
because
they
will
treat
you

an
idiot
this
is
totally
untrue
apple
will
treat
you
like
a
fking
assanine
idiot
for
even
considering
going
third
party
and
if
you
want
this
treatment
wants
you
to
pay
for
their
thech
support
line
the
supposedly
compitantly
one
and
then
still
has
no
fu
clue
personal
experience
also
the
tech
suppport
for
the
vga
monitor
makers
doesnt
see
to
extend

magnavox
in

to
this
to
find
out
the
info
you
will
have
to
call
dealers
unless
you
can
find
the
sync
rates
elsewhere
as
ads
like
hardware
that
fits
that
rate
monitor
resolutions
give
the
most
favorable
rating
which
usually
means
you
can
get
this
if
you
use

cardie
well
you

on

hi
do
any

gurus
out
there
know
what
kind
of

architecture
apple
uses
in

duos
or
in

in

what
are
the
factors
that
make
the
duo
so
slow
compared
to
a
desktop
machine
running
the

at
the
same
speed
how
many
wait
states
are

what

it
use

its
still
slow

anyone
know
in
general
what
kind

shortcuts
notebook

take

i
heard
of

quadra
marginal
video
we
are
having
a
problem
with
a
quadra
that
has
stumped
a
couple
of
techs
sent
to
us
by
the
vendor
as
well
as
us
this
quadra
is
stuffed
with
ram
vram
and
some
large
disk
i
think
what
happens
is
that
after
a
certain
variable
interval
of
time
the
video
circuitry
loses
vertical
sync
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
mac
cpu
is
still
ok
and
the
problem
really
seems
to
lie
with
the
video
circuitry
since
you
can
still
save
your
documents
quit
your
aplpications
even
pull
down
menus
etc
only
the
display
is
scrolling
lik
crazy
so
its
pretty
hard
to
hit
menu
items
we
had
the
original
logic
board
replaced
twice
now
and
the
same
problem
has
been
occurring
on
all
boards
although
the
inteval
between
occurrences
has
varied
the
first
board
had
this
problem
every
about
more
often
if
the
cache
was
turned
off
yes
off
this
is
the
only
symptom
that
is
not
obviously
related
to
the
video
circuitry
after
all
the
cache
is
on
the
cpu
right
the
second
board
had
the
problem
every
about
minutes
we
did
not
keep
it
rather
we
put
the
original
back
the
current
board
we
have
has
this
problem
a
lot
less
often
has
gone
about
a
week
without
doing
it
but
did
it
twice
within
an
hour
yesterday
the
technicians
that
have
come
out
to
try
to
figure
it
out
seemed
pretty
sharp
and
tried
a
number
of
sensible
things
most
of
which
we
had
previously
tried
ourselves
anyway
these
included
swapping
the
ram
swapping
the
vram
swapping
monitors
different
apple
rgb
and
apple
rgb
swapping
cables
disconnecting
hd
and
booting
from
floppy
sacrificing
various
small
mammals
here
are
some
other
facts
when
we
put
a
rasterops
procolor
on
the
nubus
the
problem
is
fixed
it
does
not
occur
with
the
internal
video
or
the
procolor
video
out
the
vendor
cannot
reproduce
the
problem
back
in
their
shop
on
the
boards
that
exhibit
it
in
our
lab
apple
is
said
to
be
getting
a
little
bit
pissed
off
at
shipping
us
boards
that
they
cannot
find
anything
wrong
with
and
getting
them
shipped
back
as
faulty
according
to
us
here
are
some
speculations
i
bet
that
neither
apple
nor
the
vendor
has
tested
these
boards
with
that
much
ram
and
vram
on
them
simultaneaously
which
may
have
something
to
do
with
their
finding
it
hard
to
reproduce
the
problem
though
we
can
reproduce
it
with
just
of
ram
so
this
is
probably
a
red
herring
the
vendors
representative
blames
metal
in
your
walls
claims
that
our
walls
have
metal
in
them
which
interferes
with
the
macs
operation
we
have
another
in
the
lab
which
works
like
a
charm
though
its
not
in
the
exact
same
spot
please
dont
tell
me
this
is
probably
it
i
do
not
want
to
believe
it
its
probably
not

since
they

provides

we
are
having
a
problem
with
a
quadra
that
has
stumped
a
couple
of
techs
sent
to
us
by
the
vendor
as
well
as
us
this
quadra
is
stuffed
with
ram
vram
and
some
large
disk
i
think
what
happens
is
that
after
a
certain
variable
interval
of
time
the
video
circuitry
loses
vertical
sync
it
is
quite
apparent
that
the
mac
cpu
is
still
ok
and
the
problem
really
seems
to
lie
with
the
video
circuitry
since
you
can
still
save
your
documents
quit
your
aplpications
even
pull
down
menus
etc
only
the
display
is
scrolling
lik
crazy

its
pretty
hard
to
hit

other

has
anyone
any
ideas

please
email

rebooting

lately
and
have
a
lot
less
time
available
to
read
news
are
you
sure
its
not
a
problem
caused
by
software
ive
seen
this
sort
of
effect
when
a
runaway
program
which
could
be
caused
by
an
init
conflict
for
instance
accidentally
wacks
on
a
register
in
the
video
hardware
have
you
tried
booting
with
no
extensions
and
then
letting
the
just
sit
there
in

finder
you
might
also
want
to
try
changing
to
addressing
yes
i
know
you
cant
access
your
full
mb
of
ram
its
just
an
experiment
as
the
video
hardware
registers
cant
be
accessed
then
another
thing
to
try
as
a
recovery
measure
is
to
use
something
like
quickkeys
to
change
the
pixel
depth
of
the
display
this
reprograms
some
of
the
video
hardware
registers
and
may
allow

to
be
restored

can

is

that
the

only

with

the

is
just
a

the

i
need
no

and
double

are
two
different

its
just
that
the
newer

have
both

multisession
means
that
when
you
put
more

on
a

cd
after
the
first

the
drive
can
read
and
display
them
double

just
transfer
any

excluding
sound
at
around
double
the
speed
which
means
i
seem
to
gain
nothing
compared
with
say
is
not
multisession
capable
this
means
that
you
lose
the
ability
to
add
any
more
pictures
after
the
first
time
must
buy
a

finally
since
the
is

it

what

that
isnt

the

the

pressing

actually
they
did

not
until
a

before
my

arrived
but
a

earlier
they
were

no
help
at

really

they

its

the

i
think
the
explanation
for

that
it

i
believe
things
that

would
be
factors
such
as
use
of

enhanced
in
the
fpu
which
the

doesnt

background
applications
can
slow
your

real

differences
in

are
likely
to
be
influence
by

i
was
just
lucky
all
of
the

i
spoke
to
didnt
know
didly
about
the

peecee
or

but
then
neither
did
any
of

dealers
i
spoke
with
if
you
wouldve
told
me
a
year
ago
that
i
would
buy
a
macintosh
from
montgomery
wards
i
woulda
laughed
for
a
long
long
time
go
figure
im
real
happy
with
my
performa
oh
and
i
bought
the
apple
performa
plus
monitor
vs
buying
party
happy
with
that
decision
as

walked

plopped
down

once

nope
i
keep

it

acts

exchanges

every

i
run

i
do
turn

the

hooked

they
produce

this

seems
to

to

with

no

here
is
the

we
can
get

to
do
a

on
if
it
is
more
feasible
to
do
a
disection
via
the
computer
or
via
the
real

my
problem
is
i
was
somehow
drawn
into
this
project
being
done
by
students
who
want
to
go
mac
but
know
nada
about
them
being
the
man
mac
man
on

guess
who
they
came
to
so
i
wnt
to
know
what
would
probably
be
the
best
hardware
to
fill
the
follwoing
list
right
now
we
are
looking
at
the
and
the
platforms
ok
here
it
goes
we
are
using
cdrom
so
ought
we
go
with
the
internal
apple
cdroms
offered
as
options
in
the
and
vx
or
go
external
it
is
a
matter
of
price
and
reliability
the
second
being
very
important
how
much
ram
i
was
thinking
more
leaning
towards
what
do
you
think
ok
called
apple
educational
discounts
and
they
said
their
keyboard
extended
is
is
it
better
to
go
with
the
apple
and
their
long
time
great
wear
and
tear
record
or
is
there
a
party
extended
keyboard
that
is
just
a
reliable
price
printers
one
color
printer
we
are
presently
leaning
towrds
the
thermal
wax
tektronic
or
probably
the
e
as
we
are
going
to
limit
access
so
we
dont
needed
the
is
networkability
so
what
do
you
think
in
terms
of
color
printers
different
brand
kind
dye
sublimation
ink
jet
price
companies
s
also
we
are

or
such
to

for
noraml
printing
the
fornt
runner
is
the
apple
is
that
right
dont
have
my
notes
here
at
suggestions
we
have
kids
using
these
things
all
day
if
this
lab
goes
through
and
they
know
nothing
about
it
for
the
most

it
has
to
be

easy
to

economical

not

flaky
large
memory
simms
on
in
the
last
two
weeks
i
have
the
following
problem
on
two
has
a
simm
and
the
other
a
mb
simm
both
are
about
months
old
bought
from
different
vendors
and
installed
by
different
people
both
computers
begin
crashing
frequently
locking
up
and
ultimately
the
memory
chimes
crashes
would
almost
always
occur
if
you
moved
the
screen
and
sometimes
would
occur
when
you
werent
even
touching
the
computer
in
both
cases
taking
the
machine
apart
taking
the
memory
out
and
putting
it
back
in
solved
the
problem
for
awhile
but
then
it
would
comeback
my
marginally
educated
guess
as
to
whats
happening
is
that
larger
simms
are
lopsided
in
that
the
insertion
point
is
sort
of
a
pivot
point
and
after
time
they
begin
to
move
about
possible
because
of
pressure
on
the
keyboard
or
something
anyway
has
anyone
else
had
such
a
problem
or
solution
if
somehow
you
could
support
the
other
end
of
the
simm
to
prevent
it
from
moving
ive
had
no
problem
for
the
past
weeks
by
replacing
my
simm
with
a
although
this
is
not
desireble
solution

now
too
if
you
want
to
receive
a

your
computer
will
have
to
be
on

not
the

and
of
course
the

you
can
set
the
number
of
rings
that
will
receive
the
fax
on
a

ring
you
set
with

its

how
to
arrange

is

but
ive
been

it
i
dont

if

any

i

try

what
kind

did
notice
an

i
understand
that
if
i
have
a
correct
adapter
then
i
can
use
a
vga
monitor
with
my
iisi
are
those
adapters
working
with
specific
brands
is
adapter
for
nec
or
sony
working
with
other
brands
i
will
be
using
a
vga
monitor
with
iisi
for
a
month
soon
i
dont
have
any
clue
what
monitor
will
be
heres
the
story
the
iisi
cannot
supply
a
vga
output
however
some
vgatype
monitors
can
adequately
deal
with
the
video
signal
the
mac
uses
to
drive
the
apple
or
inch
high
resolution
color
displayie
apples
own
mode
so
if
you
wish
to
hook
one
of
these
monitors
up
to
your
iisi
you
need
a
an
adapter
that
converts
from
the
mac
connector
to
the
vgastyle
high
density
connector
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
its
own
mode
not
the
vga
mode
and
b
a
vga
monitor
that
can
deal
with
the
higher
bandwidth
of
the
mac
mode
over
the
vga
mode
which
as
i
stated
in
above
the
iisi
cannot
produce
as
far
as
a
above
is
concerned
contact
james
engineering
inc
fairmount
ave
el
cerrito
ca
fax
they
can
probably
get
you
the
right
adapter
remember
you
do
not
want
the
runofthemill
mactovga
adapter
because
it
will
try
to
have
your
iisi
produce
the
vga
mode
which
it
cannot
the
computer
will
just
fail
to
produce
any
video
signal
at
all
instead
you
want
an
adapter
that
connects
between
the
macstyle
and
vgastyle
connectors
but
tells
the
mac
to
use
the
apple
mode
sorry
for
the
poor
terminology
available
for
describing
this
distinction
as
far
as
b
is
concerned
make
sure
to
get
a
monitor
that
can
deal
with
a
horizontal
bandwidth
of
khz
and
a
vertical
retrace
rate
of
hz
these
are
the
specs
of
apples
mode
for
comparison
the
vgastandard
mode
uses
a
khz
horizontal
bandwidth
and
a
hz
vertical
retrace
rate
the
monitor
will
probably
need
to
have
autosynching
capability
as
the
apple
mode
youll
be
using
isnt
one
of
the
set
of
standard
modes
in
the
pc

the

on

when
i

my

ii
the

harddrives
and
it
was
clear
that
buying
another
of

would
cost
much
more
than
the
difference
in
price
between
the
two

uartions
there
is
an

break
in

and
you
will
not

spending
the

be

when

look
at
the

size
they
come
with
and
how
much
it
would
cost
you
to

down

might
be
a

strategy
even
if

still
used
two

was
metal
while
traveling
with

it
was
in
my
mac
bag
on

of

this
past
winter
one
of
the
plastic
tabs
holding
the
front
panel
on
broke
so
that
the
right
side
of
the
front
panel
was
coming
forward
away
from
the
rest
of
the
drive
i
lived
with
this
situation
until
it
became
completely
intolerable
which
more
or
less
coincided
with
a
network
shutdown
at
school
and
a
trip
out
of
town
i
had
to
take
which
gave
me
some
dead
time
during
which
to
have
the
drive
sent
out
i
called
aps
for
an
rma
and
got
one
with
no
questions
asked
about
how
the
tab
got
broken
it
was
handled
a
little
roughly
by
airline
baggage
handlers
though
nothing
else
was
damaged
well

for

internal
speaker
in

wasnt

glued

little
later
rather
than
right
away
they
had
no
problem
with
that
even
when
i
exceeded
the
normal
valid
period
for
an
rma
by
a
day
theyre
usually
good
for
days
the

panel
was
replaced

was

programs

write

a
professor
of

once
said
the
difference
between
a
computer
engineer
and
a
computer
scientist
is
about
meaning
the
engineer
makes
more
than
ps
the
is
not
just
a
joke
scott
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
bunch
of
bunk
ive
got
a
computer
engineering
degree
yet
ive
spent
the
last
years
writing
software
that
people
actually
use
moreover
the
salary
distinctions
are
incorrect
i
received
job
offers
upon
graduation
the
two
jobs
that
actually
used
my
hardware
experience
were
lower
my
advice
is
to
decide
which
classes
and
projects
most
interest
you
and
pick
the
major
that
allows
you
to
take
them
emt
well
here
is
my
worth
advice
from
a
grad
student
i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
comment
before
me
the
important
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
it
in
my
five
years
of
education
in
this
field
though
brief
compare
to
alot
of
people
i
had
to
think
about
this
kind
of
question
a
lot
did
i
make
the
right
decision
in
going
into
electrical
engineering
as
opposed
to
computer
engineering
or
cs
the
more
i
go
thru
school
the
more
i
believe
that
this
kind
of
question
is
irrelevant
interesting
as
i
think
computer
technology
is
now
becomming
widespread
enough
now
that
it
is
no
longer
a
position
which
must
require
a
degree
i
know
of
several
people
i
work
with
that
make
just
as
much
as
i
do
and
they
dont
even
have
a
bs
degree
in
comp
sci
yet
they
make
a
year
they
also
didnt
have
to
pay
grand
to
thier
local
university
either
i
think
computer
programming
is
being
reduced
to
a
trade
practice
than
a
truly
specialty
field
it
will
be
even
more
so
in
the
future
if
your
interested
in
cutting
edge
type
of
stuff
and
you
choose
cs
as
i
did
i
suggest
checking
out
the
emerging
field
of
software
engineering
the
difficulties
for
example
of
designing
scaleable
design
environments
for
individuals
so
that
a
single
person
can
handle
to
million
lines
of
code
all
by
himself
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
then
incorporate
that
into
a
teamwork
enviroment
is
truly
a
gigantic
problemnot
going
to
be
solved
any
time
soon
unfortunatelybut
hey
you
could
be
the
person
that
provides
the
missing
key
for
some
good
groundwork
i
have
come
to
believe
that
choosing
cs
because
one
does
not
like
hardware
or
choosing
hardware
because
one
does
not
like
to
program
is
really
doing
an
injustice
of
building
and
computer
and
making
it
useful
for
something
everything
is
interwoven
and
inseparable
cs
ce
and
ee
are
all
a
part
of
a
really
great
discipline
and
do
depend
on
each
other
my
advice
is
dont
limit
yourself
but
make
a
decision
based
on
which
major
will
give
you
the
best
opportunities
to
learn
that
of
course
depends
on
the
curriculum
at
your
persective
school
i
would
choose
a
major
that
allows
me
to
explore
as
much
as
possible
beside
i
dont
know
why
the
school
would
make
a
student
choose
a
major
before
herhis
sophamore
year
hey
you
may
be
so
interested
in
this
field
that
you
decided
to
learn
all
about
the
making
of
computers
in
which
case
you
suffer
a
little
more
and
go
to
grad
school
about
the
money
dont
look
at
the
averages
if
you
are
good
you
are
going
to
earn
more
money
than
anyone
else
if
you
are
a
superstar
programmer
you
will
earn
millions
like
wise
if
you
are
a
hotshot
computer
designers
well
if
your
like
the
poor
slobs
in
the
worldlike
me
you
are
in
no
financial
position
to
continue
graduate
work
right
out
of

the
trick
is
to
find

a
friend
of
mine
who
owns
a
pc
said
that
he
recently
got
a
program
that
can
format
a
disk
that
can
exceed
the
normal
capacity
of
a
hd
disk
apparently
it
rewrites
the
driver
or
takes
or
the
driver
or
something
that
allows
it
get
more
space
out
of
a
normal
hd
floppy
disk
it
supposedly
gets
upto
megs
so
something
like
i
dont
have
the
program
since
i
cant
use
it
and
its
supposed
to
be
called
something
like
or
something
like
that
my
question
is
whether
its
possible
to
do
this
on
the
mac
and
if
its
not
possible
is
it
due
to
hardware
limitations
a
developer
friend
of
mine
said
that
it
might
be
possible
but
he
doesnt
deal
with
this
aspect
of
the
field
much

hds
i
have
a
question
for
yall
im
looking
at
an
ad
for
the
new
fast
drives
from
micropolis
in
the
june
macworld
i
have
seen
similar
ads
for
the
ide
versions
in
ibm
pc
magazines
well
the
ad
says
that
all
three
drives
have
a
fast
interface
but
then
it
says
that
the
dtr
rate
for
each
drive
is
megabytessecond
max
how
can
this
be
i
thought
that
if
a
drive
was
to
be
fast
it
had
to
have
a
dtr
of
a
second
i
am
assuming
the
claim
by
micropolis
is
from
the
cache
i
admit
that
i
would
be
very
impressed
if
the
drive
can
readwrite
data
at
a

quadra
pds
video
cards
a
friend
is
heavily
into
midi
and
is
using
a
quadra
maybe
with
all
but
one
nubus
slot
populated
with
arcane
music
hardware
and
a
video
card
he
reports
bit
video
is
too
slow
for
good
realtime
display
of
what
he
needs
to
see
he
also
reports
that
the
builtin
video
is
even
worse
hes
not
a
mac
guru
and
i
havent
seen
the
system
so
this
is
about
all
i
know
i
suspect
that
his
nubus
is
heavily
loaded
and
think
improvements
might
come
from
a
switch
to
an
accelerated
pds
slot
video
card
does
this
sound
right
who
makes
a
pds
accelerated
video
card
for
the
quadra
thats
worth
looking
at
any
other
suggestions
thanks

advance

jay
scott
writes
a
rep
at
the
dealer
actually
its
a
university
order
center
so
they
dont
have
any
immediate
financial
interest
told
me
that
they
have
been
having
lots
of
problems
with
their
centris
he
didnt
go
into
details
but
mentioned
problems
with
the
floppy
drive
and
intermittent
problems
with
printing
files
it
sounded
to
me
like
they
were
having
both
hardware
problems
and
software
compatibility
problems
with
the
machine
hes
not
recommending
the
centris
to
anybody
he
says
to
consider
a
centris
or
a
iivx
why
he
would
recommend
a
iivx
over
an
lciii
i
dont
know
but
thats
what
he
said
so
what
does
the
net
think
did
the
dealer
just
get
one
flaky
machine
or
did
apple
send
the
out
the
door
too
early
is
your
working
just
great
or
is
it
buggy
too
jay
scott
scottcsuiucedu
sounds
to
me
like
your
dealer
really
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
iivxs
he
has
in
stock
i
can
imaging
that
they
are
getting
hard
to
sell
given
that
a
is
way
faster
and
is
comparable
in
price
an
lciii
is
about
the
same
speed
and
is
way
cheaper
so
your
dealer
may
well
be
trying
as
hard
as
he
can
to
convince
people
that
iivxs
are
a
much
better
buy
than
a
just
so
he
can
get
rid
of
all
his
old
stock
no
disrespect
to
dealers
or
the
iivx
intended

re

should

a
day
i
have
some
questions
about
this
subject
i
like
to
leave
my
computer
on
if
i
think
im
going
to
be
using
it
withing
the
next
or
hours
but
i
get
sick
of
my
dad
constantly
coming
up
to
me
and
asking
why
is
the
computer
on
if
youre
not
using
it
i
also
wonder
about
my
computer
being
harmed
by
fluctuations
in
voltage
from
other
things
garbage
disposal
etc
here
are
my
questions
how
much
harm
do
voltage
fluctuations
cause
my
computer
does
not
share
a
circuit
with
anything
big
but
our
my
light
dims
when
a
refrigerator
comes
on
or
the
garbage
disposal
is
turned
on
whose
doesnt
and
also
when
the
washing
machine
does
anything
all
these
things
cause
a
drop
in
voltage
which
is
harmful
to
a
computer
right
i
also
notice
the
fan
in
my
system
saver
turning
at
different
speeds
is
it
safer
to
turn
it
off
and
back
on
when
i
want
to
use
it
or
to
leave
it
on
how
much
electricity
does
my
computer
use
i
have
an
apple
iigs
ne
flames
with
a
kensington
system
saver
gs
electric
fan
inside
an
applecolor
rgb
monitor
and
an
external
hd
fan
and
its
own
ps
how
do
i
translate
this
into
kilowatthours
also
how
much
of
this
is
used
by
the
monitor
does
the
monitor
use
considerably
less
juice
when
the
screen
is
totally
black
but
still
on
many
computers
spin
the
hd
up
and
down
constantly
to
save
power
i
always
thought
this
was
harmful
to
the
hd
and
defeats
the
purpose
of
leaving
the
computer
on
in
the
first
place
except
portables
is
this
true
thanks
for
the
info
i
think
this
will
help
lots

people
stacy
