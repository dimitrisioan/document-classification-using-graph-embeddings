have
you
head
of
small
claims
you
may
have
to
put
money
up
front
for
the
filing
fees
and
then
possibly
having
the
local
sheriff
of
hisher
city
to
deliver
the
bad
news
in
the
end
the
other
party
will
end
up
paying
for
hisher
mistake
with
interest
from
the
time
of
the
filing
to
the
pay
date
of
the
defendent
i
think
the
problem
with
small
claims
court
is
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
location
of
the
person
youre
taking
action
against
it
seems
to
me
the
time
and
money
involved
in
travelling
out
there
unless
this
person
is
close
to
you
wouldnt
be
worth
it
for
a
small
claim
it
really
depends
on
how
much
money
youre
out
if
i
am
wrong
about
any
of
this

help
how
to
get
a

hi
everyone
i
need
an
advice
on
what
is
the
best
way
to
get
a
scumster
several
weeks
ago
i
posted
an
article
on
behalf
of
a
friend
who
wanted
an
external
hd
for
mac
the
scumster
rep
called
my
friend
and
they
agreed
on
a
price
my
friend
unexperienced
and
not
too
fluent
in
english
paid
by
check
requesting
rep
to
call
him
back
when
the
check
arrives
and
the
hd
is
send
well
the
check
was
cashed
and
that
is
that
phone
that
rep
gave
is
on
the
answering
machine
all
the
time
and
there
is
no
reaction
when
the
message
is
left
email
address
does
not
bounce
but
again
there
is
no
answer
i
know
that
rep
is
a
student
at
university
of
delaware
i
have
his
email
address
his
us
postal
address
and
his

the
question
is
what
is
the
best
way
to
proceed
thanks
in

for
any

sincerely

tom
carlino
says
recently
i
bought
a
musical
instrument
through
the
internet
and
had
it
shipped
to
me
via
ups
ground
the
shipping
was
done
through
a
mail
box
service
mailboxes
etc
being
somewhat
surprised
at
the
price
i
compared
prices
of
shipping
this
way
to
shipping
directly
through
ups
and
this
is
a
summary
i
am
not
making
any
endorsements
or
condemnations
but
merely
presenting
the
facts
from
which
you
may
draw
your
own
conclusions
ive
encountered
the
same
thing
with
mailboxes
etc
and
i
suggest
anyone
to
use
the
original
ups
service
if
at
all
possible
shipping
to
virginia
from
cleveland
was
around
for
pounds
and
cod
was
as
opposed
to
for
ups
ill
third
the
opinion
about
this
outfitfranchise
now
when
i
buy
over
the
net
and
pick
up
the
shipping
costs
ill
specify
that
i
only
pick
up
the
normal
ups
charges
as
if
delivered
directly
to
ups
as
ive
been
burned
by
shipping
charges
for
a
pkg
i
will
never
use
a
mailing
service
unless
i
dont
have
the
right
box
and
the
buyer
needs
whatever
immediately
ill
also
tell
the
person
if
they
agreed
to
pick
up
shipping
what
is
going
on
other
things
to
watch
out
forconsider
the
rates
are
to
higher
than
ups
direct
for
a
nonups
truck
package
they
quoted
a
rate
of
fed
ex
economy
air
was
only
for
the
same
weight
rps
a
trucking
package
company
in
many
cities
only
wanted
guess
who
got
it
the
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
about
competitors
rates
said
rps
was
unreliable
ive
used
them
before
with
no
problems
etc
right
a
cod
check
goes
to
the
mailing
service
our
local
mailbox
then
takes
its
sweet
time
mailing
me
the
remade
check
all
this
for
an
additional
over
the
ups
cod
charge
what
a
deal
for
packages
over
they
charge
you
about
double
over
what
ups
charges
them
for
insurance
ive
never
had
a
claim
but
other
netters
is
ralph
seguin
out
there
have
told
horror
stories
about
them
all
package
traces
have
to
be
done
through
mailbox
by
mailbox
our
local
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
lying
when
i
asked
him
why
their
rates
were
stratospheric
compared
to
direct
ups
does
he
ever
check
probably
not
their
ups
ground
rates
come
close
to
fed
exs
economy
air
rate
and
fed
ex
will
pick

ups
will
pick

four
contain
moderately
challanging
puzzles
the
really
interesting
thing
about
this
game
is
that
it
is
really
broken
up
into
four
seperate
rpgs
one
for
each
of
the
four
exhibits
you
must
enter
in
starting
each
one
your
character
is
transported
with
no
objects
to
use
and
experience
level
one
exhibits
traps
you
inside
a
multilevel
ancient
egyptian
pyramid
which
you
must
escape
by
fighting
mapping
and
puzzle
solving
another
exhibit
traps
you
in
a
mine
that
has
been
taken
over
by
creeping
plant
vines
and
pods
while
the
local
humans
have
been
transformed
into
plant
zombies
this
is
a
single
level
maze
that
requires
you
to
rescue
some
humans
kill
the
head
plant
alien
and
figuere
out
how
to
kill
the
very
tuff
plant
zombies
that
are
always
showing
up
this
is
perhaps
the
most
horrifying
exhibit
another
exhibit
puts
you
into
jack
the
ripper
england
where
you
appear
by
the
corpse
of
a
fresh
ripper
victim
and
of
course
the
police
think
you
are
responsible
you
must
avoid
police
and
angry
mobs
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
ripper
and
meet
him
face
to
face
but
first
get
a
disquise
the
last
exhibit
pus
you
in
a
graveyard
where
most
of
the
challenge
is
in
learning
to
stop
the
almost
indestructible
zombies
over
all
the
vga
graphics
and
music
are
very
effective
in
setting
a
creepy
tone
for
the
game
as
was
the
case
for
the
elvira
games
though
gameplay
is
much
improved
and
makes
for
a
much
more
enjoyable
game
i
heartily
recommend
it
for
rpg
and
horror
fans

is
a

too
much
to
be
spending
on
each
game
but
ahh
the
quality
now
i
can
get
them
for

thats
still
a

right

motherboard
it
is
simply
because
the
case
is
custommade
for
this
particular
board
and
you
would
be
hardpressed
to
fit
another
mb
in
it
however
the
case
and
this
motherboard
were
made
to
go
together
and
fit
perfectly
as
you
can
see
since
this
board
includes
drive
controllers
and
a
video
controller
you
can
save
some
money
by
buying
this
unit
and
not
a
mb
where
you
would
need
to
get
io
cards
video
card
and
drive
controllers
its
just
a
lot
more
convenient
on
the
whole
i
would
like
to
ask
about
for
this
whole
package
i
think
this
is
a
fair
price
given
the
facts
that
it
includes
a
video
card
and
drive
controllersio
ports
all
you
need
to
do
is
add
drives
a
monitor
ram
and
a
keyboard
also
keep
in
mind
that
it
isnt
a
generic
board
but
from
compuadd
i
also
will
entertain

it
usually

by

called

they
sent
me
a
award
certificate
three
months
ago
and
asked
me
to
buy
their
promotion
package
in

receive
the

they
mislabled
my
address
and
i
did
not
receive
my
package
until
one
month
ago
i
was
mad
and
angry
about
how
it
took
them
so
long
to
get
my
package
so
i
wrote
them
a
letter
and
requested
for
a
refund
they
never
return
my
letter
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
out
their
telephone
number
through
operator
and
received
the
package
i
immediately
returned
the
package
and
wrote
them
another
letter
to
ask
for
refund
the
package
was
returned
because
they
address
they
put
on
the
package
was
incorrect
i
attempted
to
call
them
and
learnd
that
they
have
changed
their
telephone
number
it
took
me
at
least
phone
calls
to
find
out
their
new
number
but
they
refused
to
take
any
responsibility
i
spoke
to
their
manager
and
she
said
she
would
call
me
back
but
she
has
not
call
yet
but
i
was
able
to
get
their
address
from
their
front
desk
should
i
just
go
ahead
and
send
the
package
or
should
i
waite
until
they
call
me
back
i
know
there
are
several
people
on
the
net
has
experience
with
the

company
i
would
like
to
know
how
they
got
their

back

apology
printing
dear
fellow
usenet
users
i
would
like
to
give
a
formal
apology
for
posting
an
advertisement
about
my
printing
business
i
did
not
intend
this
to
be
an
advertisement
but
rather
an
offer
for
people
on
the
usenet
many
of
whom
use
printing
on
a
regular
basis
i
was
not
aware
that
this
is
not
legal
on
the
usenet
i
am
only
trying
to
put
myself
through
college
for
those
of
you
who
requested
information
i
will
write
to
you
privately
for
those
of
you
who
are
having
fun
flooding
my
mailbox
i
think
you
can
grow
up
to
offer
advice
is
one
thing

to
use
profanity

me
is
another

the

is

is
signed
john
kennedy
i
dont
remember
if
it
was
signed
senator
john
kennedy
or
whether
or
not
it
was
dated
because
i
havent
looked
at
it
in
quite
a
while
currently
it
is
in
a
safety
deposit
box
i
would
rather
sell
to
a
private
collector
rather
then
go
through
an
auction
house
such
as
christys
since
that
would
tend
to
take
away
from

you

its

of

for

it

ive
used
the
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
can
certainly
understand
why
it
is
as
popular
as
it
is
ive
been
using
one
for
a
little
while
and
although
i
had
some
problems
with
it
recently
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
particular
one
i
was
using
had
been
on
the
road
for
two
years
and
had
truly
been
used
during
that
time
this
is
the
same
exact
dat
machine
that
was
lugged
around

us
and

record

musicians

who
use

been

the

about

is
that
you

on

i
run

runs
directly

i
have
made

for

first

you
have

would
prefer
to

this
can
be
done
as
well
the

will
go
nicely
along

sides

front
of
the

everything
works
perfectly
the

has
an

you

i
bought

reasons
and
i
have
never

dont

in

a
deal
is
a
lemon
hi
to
all
since
all
of
you
could
also
be
a
seller
as
well
as
a
buyer
id
like
to
bring
this
issue
for
discussion
what
would
be
the
best
solution
in
case
a
deal
became
a
lemon
as
i
understand
most
people
selling
things
over
the
net
do
not
grant
a
warrantyi
am
in
such
a
situation
that
the
seller
did
not
state
whether
a
warranty
would
be
granted
or
not
and
the
item
i
received
is
out
of
order
the
seller
insisted
that
it
was
in
good
condition
when
he
sent
it
and
so
would
just
return
half
ofthe
amount
that
i
paid
if
i
send
the
item
back
to
him
and
after
he
is
sured
it
is
bad
is

i
would

also
i

positively
to

anything
wrong
which
might

the

here
is
everyone
is
honest
so
rule
out
the
possibility
that
either
one
of
the
two

or
both
are
liars
i

either
in
here
or
directly
respond

my

there

im
sure
that

just
how

up
why
are

willing

they
are

the

note
this

im

it

re

by

car
stereo
stolen
from
them
could
you
please
forward
this
message
to
them
thanks
kris
i
was
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
those
removeablefrontpanels
were
to
make
the
radio
useless
and
thus
discourage
theft
that
is
if
the
cover
were
removed
by
the
owner
and
taken
along
whenever
the
car
was
left
if
those
covers
were
sold
for
anything
remarkably
less
than
the
radio
originally
costs
or
even
sold
at
all
then
the
above
discouragement
wouldnt
be
so
great
i
personally
would
be
unhappy
if
i
bought
a
radio
like
that
thinking
that
removing
the
cover
greatly
depreciated
the
radios
value
and
the
covers
were
sold
by
the
company

other
legitimate

good
people
out

not
that
i
think
we
shouldnt
hear
about
the
bad
deals
but
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
some
good
news
once
in
a
while
after
seeing
his
post
on
one
of
the
for
sale
groups
i
mailed
mr
mark
miller
a
request
for
his
copy
of
wordperfect
for
dos
he
suggested
a
price
of
in
his
ad
but
when
i
phoned
him
he
quoted
plus
shipping
that
sounded
more
than
fair
to
me
so
i
told
him
that
i
would
send
him
a
check
the
next
day
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
logged
into
my
account
the
following
day
and
found
a
message
from
him
saying
that
it
had
already
been
sold
after
i
had
just
mailed
the
money
order
after
another
email
message
to
him
he
apologized
and
assured
me
that
it
was
a
mistake
i
was
the
one
who
he
was
holding
it
for
he
sent
the
package
as
soon
as
he
got
the
money
along
with
a
letter
stating
a
transfer
of
license
this
wasnt
good
enough
for
wordperfect
so
i
asked
him
to
fill
out
one
of
their
forms
no
problem
we
thought
it
took
three
times
to
get
it
to
the
right
address
my
fault
anyway
he
mailed
me
the
form
for
my
signature
and
included
a
workbook
that
i
had
no
idea
was
included
in
the
deal
again
he
apologized
for
not
sending
it
before
i
now
have
the
worlds
best
word
processor
and
a
renewed
hope
in
the
world
that
there
are
a
few
good
ones
left
i
recoend
that
if
you
ever
see
that
mark
is
selling
anything
thatat
you
may
want
give
him
a
call
if
i
had
the
choice
i
would
purchase

kenneth
dwayne
ray
writes
i
had
the
front
panel
of
my
car
stereo
stolen
this
weekend
i
need
to
buy
the
front
panel
of
a
sony
car
stereo
i
was
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
those
removeablefrontpanels
were
to
make
the
radio
useless
and
thus
discourage
theft
that
is
if
the
cover
were
removed
by
the
owner
and
taken
along
whenever
the
car
was
left
if
those
covers
were
sold
for
anything
remarkably
less
than
the
radio
originally
costs
or
even
sold
at
all
then
the
above
discouragement
wouldnt
be
so
great
i
personally
would
be
unhappy
if
i
bought
a
radio
like
that
thinking
that
removing
the
cover
greatly
depreciated
the
radios
value
and
the
covers
were
sold
by
the
company
or
other
legitimate
source
cheaply
the
front
covers
should
be
available
from
sony
check
with
a
local
car
stereo
shop
you
will
probably
definitely
have
to
provide
the
units
serial
number
and
hopefully
you
had
registered
the
warranty
card
i
dont
know
the
cost
but
replacements
have
to
be
available
to
people
who
damage
the
face
cover
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
it
can
be
replaced
as
to
deterring
theft
when
i
worked
for
a
stereo
shop
we
referred
the
customer
to
a
sony
number
we
would
not
sell
the
face
nor
did
we
have
them
available
most
people
who
came
in
asking
for
the
face
cover
or
a
pullout
sleave
for
that
matter
would
look
very
disheartened
to
find
that
they
acquired
a
deck
they
couldnt
use
if
theft
occurs
with
these
decks
notify
sony

reminding
us
that
advertising
is
not
done
on
internet
as
a
matter
of
fact
dj
it
does
make
a
difference
almost
a
half
million
new
users
joined
the
internet
last
year
many
of
them
are
commercial
businesses
the
ban
on
commercial
use
of
internet
is
no
more
jack
there
is
a
difference
between
using
the
network
for
commercial
purposes
and
advertising
in
newsgroups
business
communication
is
okay
advertising
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
users
around
the
planet
who
have
no
desire
to
receive
advertising
is
not
okay
those
of
us
who
pay
for
internet
access
are
constrained
only
by
our
innate
good
taste
and
no
have
no
administrator
to
guide
us
i
suspect
that
a
site
which
generated
a
large
volume
of
material
not
in
anybodys
good
taste
would
find
itself
getting
a
lot
of
attention
it
didnt
want
you
may
belong
to
the
public
library
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
can
deface
the
books
disorder
the
stacks
or
disturb
the
other
patrons
youre
constrained
by
the
same
rules
that
the
rest
of
the
users
many
academic
and
military
who
get
irritable
about
a
network
for
which
they
pay
with
tax
and
grant
money
carrying
private
business
advertising
follow
there
are
secret
masters
here
just
like
everywhere
else
theyre
not
as
obvious
as
the
ones
on
prodigy
but
theyre
here
no
doubt
at
some
point
the
internet
like
everything
else
will
become
grotty
enough
to
carry
advertising
at
that
time
i
hope
it
is
confined
to
its
own
newsgroups
and
not

thanks
it
is
my
impression
that
net
etiquette
does
not
allow
companies
to
use
the
net
to
directly
advertise
their
products
the
net
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
dumping
ground
for
free
ads
but
reserving
it
for
tripe
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
significant
improvement
in
addition
to
improper
etiquette
this
product
is
a
mailing
list
used
for
generating
junk
mail
so
either
they
target
it
well
enough
to
pay
for
it
in
other
words
they
manage
to
send
it
to
people
who
want
the
stuff
in
which
case
it
is
junk
only
for
the
rest
and
the
transaction
costs
are
borne
appropriately
in
this
case
or
they
go
bankrupt
seems
fair
to
me
am
i
correct
in
assuming
this
is
improper
and
if
so
what
can
be
done
to
penalize
such
an
improper
use
you
could
hold
your
breath
you
could
kill
offending
messages
as
they
come
onto
your
machine
and
refuse
to
send
them
any
further
but
not
until
you

it
is
a
midi

digital

what
can
it
do
with
your

it
can
pitchshift
it
change
the

you
sing
it
can
add
harmonies
to
your

up
to
parts
at
one
time
it
can
change
your
voice
into
a
synthesizers
voice
but
leave
what
you
say
alone
and
intelligible
this
works
well
for
a
computerized

for
those
of
you
who
just
thought
about
that
yes
you
can

leadins
with
it
and
yes
im
a
little
redfaced
to
say
that
i
tried
those
specifically
for
an
input
it
takes
both

for

you
can
have

and
your
choice
of
mix
between
the
original
signal
and
the
effect
can
be
effect
only
if
desired
it
has
preset
setups
which
you
can
edit
and
save
for
your

it
has
a

of
light
scratches
but
does
not
look
bad
and
works
flawlessly
even
when
we
dont

it
in

well
im
not
sure
id
go
quite
that

i
agree
that
motorola

of
better
quality
the
question
is
how
much
that
quality
is
worth
to
a
ham
in
amateur
service
not
commercial
service
this

can
hear
a

ok
great

how
often
does
that

up
how

is
good

and
how
much
is
someone
willing

pay
for
it

ht
is
maybe
while
a
commercial
quality
one
is
maybe
is
the
increased
reliability
and
performance
worth
times
the
price
in

only
the

involved
can
answer
that
question
and
each

has
to
decide
for

if

quality
is

to
you
then
more

optonica
tuner
and
integrated
amp
forsale
i
have
an
old
optonica
tuner
and
integrated
amp
that
i
no
longer
use
the
integrated
amp
section
does
not
work
right
now
but
should
not
cost
much
to
fix
i
believe
that
it
is
just
a
chip
i
have
used
it
as
a
preamp
and
it
works
great
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
and
well
built
set
they
both
are
low
profile
but
the
amp
is
rather
heavy
the
tuner
is
in
fine
working
condition
and
is
a
match
to
the
amp
the
amp
is
rated
at
these
peices
went
for
about
new
i
would
like
to
get
obo
for
the
pair
if
anybody
has
knowledge
anough
to
fix
the
amp
i

scsi
hard
drive
model
i
originally
bought
this
drive
because
it
had
a
small
stiction
problem
and
i
though
that
i
could
fix
it
well
i
determined
that
the
drive
mechanism
was
fine
and
that
it
was
a
controller
problem
motor
controller
wasnt
sending
proper
signals
well
after
taking
the
controller
off
the
drive
looking
at
it
and
putting
it
back
together
i
realized
that
i
accidentally
severed
one
of
the
small
flat
cables
that
connect
the
drive
to
the
controller
i
tried
to
solder
it
but
im
not
that
good
at
soldering
so
i
couldnt
do
it
worked
perfectly
before
i
messed
up
i
used
it
as
a
temporary
drive
when
the
sony
above
crashed
on
me
also
loaded
the
drive
with
about
twenty
mac
applications
worth
well
over
claris
cad
ms
word
think
c
excel
and
many
others
i
think
all
it
needs
is
a
resoldering
of
that
cable
you
also
get
all
the
software
on
the
drive
if
you
can
accept
being
a
pirate
i
only
ask
that
you
delete
my
data
files
from
the
drive
i
was
really
angry
when
i
broke
that
connection
and
then
couldnt
fix
it
i
just
dont
have
time
to
play
with
it
any
more
att
isdn
modem
this
is
for
use
on
digital
phone
systems
if
you
know
what
this
is
or
would
like
technical
information
on
it
let
me
know
i
have
some
tech
documents
on
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
thing
as
an
att
digital
phone
but
without
the
phone
part
it
seems
to
be
in
working
order
passes
self
test
perfectly
ok
i
have
no
idea
how
this
is
worth
let
me
know
if
youre
interested
motorola
coprocessor
i
havent
tested
this
one
out
yet
but
if
anyone
is
interested
i
will
get
it
tested
out
to
make
sure
that
it
works
i
had
trouble
using
it
with
my
accelerator
board
but
then
i
spoke
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
board
and
found
out
it
couldnt
be
used
without
another
controller
chip
when
i
was
looking
around
to
buy
one
new
the
prices
were
around
i
will
guarantee
this
to
work

dont
even

on

number
virtually
identical
to
the
one
above
each
drive
drive
these
things
are
proprietary
so
i
cant
test
it
but
i
think
it
works
not
sure
if
its
high
density
or
low
density
but
i
suppose
someone
who
is
looking
for
one
would
know
model

that

created

the
can
be
played
on
the
this
has
been
the
main
midi
controller
in
my
studio
for
quite
a
while
now
it
has
performed
ably
in
that
role
and
has
also
been
a
heavily
used
sound
source
at
the
same
time
the
seems
to
have
been
designed
with
this
role
in
mind
and
it
works
very
well
with
my
software
sequencer
wincake
in
its
multitimbral
mode
from
a
synthesis
point
of
view
this
machine
is
a
hybrid
it
uses
looped
short
samples
there
are
of
them
as
sources
then
these
waves
are
processed
with
a
sophisticated
dcfdca
arrangement
the
is
capable
of
great
things
because
of
its
analog
lowpass
filter
simply
put
it
makes
fabulous
analog
synth
sounds
but
unlike
most
good
analog
synths
it
has
a
very
thorough
midi
implementation
so
that
it
works
very
well
with
a
midi
sequencer
what
i
really
like
most
about
this
thing
is
that
it
is
capable
of
making
a
very
wide
range
of
sounds
this
is
about
years
old
mfg
date
it
does
have
an
sequencer
but
like
most
onboard
sequencers
it
is
a
pain
to
use
so
i
have
avoided
it
reason
for
sale
i
am
selling
my
because
i
recently
joined
forces
with
another

here

and
we

it

once

this
was

of
kevin

post
this
but
just
so
no
one
is
misled
the
vast
majority
of
usenetters
are
honest
and
good
people
in
fact
in
the
latest
study
of
all
netdeals
went
off
smoothly
without
a
hitch
its
just
that
the
few
bad
ones
are
what
get
all
the
publicity
agreed
i
have
yet
to
run
into
a
problem
in
deals
over
the
net
and
i
have
bought
things
from
cds
plenty
to
a
full
computer
the
only
small
problem
that
i
have
had
was
with
ups
rather
than
the
seller
besides
complaints
are
always
what
get
the
publicitywhen
something
goes
wrong
people
complain
rarely
have
i
seen
posts
stating
how
well
a
deal
went
through
i
guess
kevin

have
you
head
of

you
may
have
to
put
money
up

for
the

fees
and
then
possibly
having
the
local
sheriff
of
hisher
city
to
deliver
the
bad
news
in

the

will
end
up
paying

mistake
with

from
the
time
of
the
filing
to
the
pay
date
of
the

i
think
the
problem
with
small
claims
court
is
that
you
have
to
go
to
the
location
of
the
person
youre
taking
action
against
it
seems
to
me
the
time
and
money
involved
in
travelling
out
there
unless
this
person
is
close
to
you
wouldnt
be
worth
it
for
a
small

it
really
depends
on
how
much
money
youre
out
if

how

hi
everyone
i
need
an

on
what

the

who
wanted

the

rep
called
my
friend
and
they
agreed
on
a

my
friend
unexperienced
and
not

fluent
in

paid
by
check
requesting
rep
to
call
him
back
when
the
check
arrives
and
the

is
send
well
the
check
was
cashed
and
that
is
that

that

gave
is

all
the
time
and
there
is
no
reaction
when
the
message
is
left
email

does
not
bounce
but
again
there
is

a

i
have
his

tom
carlino
says
recently
i
bought
a
musical
instrument
through
the
internet
and
had
it
shipped
to
me
via
ups
ground
the
shipping
was
done
through
a
mail
box
service
mailboxes
etc
being
somewhat
surprised
at
the
price
i
compared
prices
of
shipping
this
way
to
shipping
directly
through
ups
and
this
is
a
summary
i
am
not
making
any
endorsements
or
condemnations
but
merely
presenting
the
facts
from
which
you
may
draw
your
own
conclusions
ive
encountered
the
same
thing
with
mailboxes
etc
and
i
suggest
anyone
to
use
the
original
ups
service
if
at
all
possible
shipping
to
virginia
from
cleveland
was
around
for
pounds
and
cod
was
as
opposed
to
for
ups
ill
third
the
opinion
about
this
outfitfranchise
now
when
i
buy
over
the
net
and
pick
up
the
shipping
costs
ill
specify
that
i
only
pick
up
the
normal
ups
charges
as
if
delivered
directly
to
ups
as
ive
been
burned
by
shipping
charges
for
a
pkg
i
will
never
use
a
mailing
service
unless
i
dont
have
the
right
box
and
the
buyer
needs
whatever
immediately
ill
also
tell
the
person
if
they
agreed
to
pick
up
shipping
what
is
going
on
other
things
to
watch
out
forconsider
the
rates
are
to
higher
than
ups
direct
for
a
nonups
truck
package
they
quoted
a
rate
of
fed
ex
economy
air
was
only
for
the
same
weight
rps
a
trucking
package
company
in
many
cities
only
wanted
guess
who
got
it
the
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
not
telling
the
truth
about
competitors
rates
said
rps
was
unreliable
ive
used
them
before
with
no
problems
etc
right
a
cod
check
goes
to
the
mailing
service
our
local
mailbox
then
takes
its
sweet
time
mailing
me
the
remade
check
all
this
for
an
additional
over
the
ups
cod
charge
what
a
deal
for
packages
over
they
charge
you
about
double
over
what
ups
charges
them
for
insurance
ive
never
had
a
claim
but
other
netters
is
ralph
seguin
out
there
have
told
horror
stories
about
them
all
package
traces
have
to
be
done
through
mailbox
by
mailbox
our
local
mailbox
operator
told
me
i
was
lying
when
i
asked
him
why
their
rates
were
stratospheric
compared
to
direct
ups
does
he
ever
check
probably
not
their
ups
ground
rates
come
close
to
fed
exs
economy
air
rate
and
fed
ex
will
pick
up
ups
will
pick
up
for

anyone
care
to
enlighten
us
whether
is
worth
upgrading
to
how
good
is
its
compression
and
can
it
be
turned
onoff
at
will
any
other
nicenasty
features
according
to
reports
if
you
dont
have
dos
yet
and
dont
have
any
utilities
qemm
stacker
pctools
norton
then
may
be
worth
it
for
people
who
have
and
some
sort
of
utility
doesnt
offer
much
youd
never
know
it
from
the
usual
hype
that
marketing
is
able
to
create
however
imho
it
seems
to
be
worth
the
to
upgrade
doublespace
seems
a
bit
saner
than
stacker
which
ive
replaced
memmaker
is
nowhere
near
as
aggressive
as
qemm
but
it
doesnt
hose
my
system

qemm

waxworks
pc
game
for
sale
waxworks
by
horrorsoftaccolade
by
the
same
folks
who
brought
you
elvira
i
ii
i
played
elvira
i
ii
and
think
that
horrorsoft
has
finally
made
a
very
playable
game
with
waxworks
the
look
and
feel
is
roughly
the
same
as
in
the
elvira
games
though
the
real
time
fighting
is
a
little
easier
to
survive
the
first
two
games
especially
elvira
ii
jaws
of
cerberus
made
it
very
tough
to
stay
alive
and
hitpoint
restoring
was
very
difficult
this
is
not
to
say
that
waxworks
is
a
walk
in
the
park
but
it
is
quite
fair
in
that
there
is
always
some
weapon
to
be
found
that
is
quite
effective
or
hint
given
as
to
the
proper
fighting
strategy
in
one
of
the
four
wax
works
to
be
explored
there
is
no
fighting
at
all
well
almost
none
though
all
four
contain
moderately
challanging
puzzles
the
really
interesting
thing
about
this
game
is
that
it
is
really
broken
up
into
four
seperate
rpgs
one
for
each
of
the
four
exhibits
you
must
enter
in
starting
each
one
your
character
is
transported
with
no
objects
to
use
and
experience
level
one
exhibits
traps
you
inside
a
multilevel
ancient
egyptian
pyramid
which
you
must
escape
by
fighting
mapping
and
puzzle
solving
another
exhibit
traps
you
in
a
mine
that
has
been
taken
over
by
creeping
plant
vines
and
pods
while
the
local
humans
have
been
transformed
into
plant
zombies
this
is
a
single
level
maze
that
requires
you
to
rescue
some
humans
kill
the
head
plant
alien
and
figuere
out
how
to
kill
the
very
tuff
plant
zombies
that
are
always
showing
up
this
is
perhaps
the
most
horrifying
exhibit
another
exhibit
puts
you
into
jack
the
ripper
england
where
you
appear
by
the
corpse
of
a
fresh
ripper
victim
and
of
course
the
police
think
you
are
responsible
you
must
avoid
police
and
angry
mobs
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
ripper
and
meet
him
face
to
face
but
first
get
a
disquise
the
last
exhibit
pus
you
in
a
graveyard
where
most
of
the
challenge
is
in
learning
to
stop
the
almost
indestructible
zombies
over
all
the
vga
graphics
and
music
are
very
effective
in
setting
a
creepy
tone
for
the
game
as
was
the
case
for
the
elvira
games
though
gameplay
is
much
improved
and
makes
for
a
much
more
enjoyable
game

too
much
to
be
spending
on
each
game
but
ahh
the

now
i
can
get
them
for

hello
i
have
a
motherboard
and
a
case
for
sale
as
a
package
both
of
them
came
from
a
compuadd
computer
i
bought
last
august
and
am
presently
upgrading
here
are
the
specs
motherboard

microsoftcompatible
grey

matches
case
all
original
manuals
and
documentation
video
drivers
etc
are
included
you
are
probably
wondering
why
i
must
sell
the
case
with
the
motherboard
it
is
simply
because
the
case
is
custommade
for
this
particular
board
and
you
would
be
hardpressed
to
fit
another
mb
in
it
however
the
case
and
this
motherboard
were
made
to
go
together
and
fit
perfectly
as
you
can
see
since
this
board
includes
drive
controllers
and
a
video
controller
you
can
save
some
money
by
buying
this
unit
and
not
a
mb
where
you
would
need
to
get
io
cards
video
card
and
drive
controllers
its
just
a
lot
more
convenient
on
the
whole
i
would
like
to
ask
about
for
this
whole
package
i
think
this
is
a
fair
price
given
the
facts
that
it
includes
a
video
card
and
drive
controllersio
ports
all
you
need
to
do
is
add
drives
a
monitor
ram
and
a
keyboard
also
keep
in
mind
that
it
isnt
a
generic
board
but
from
compuadd
i
also
will
entertain
all
serious
offers
please

it
usually

i
participated
a
promotion
by
a
company
called
visual
images
they
sent
me
a
award
certificate
three
months
ago
and
asked
me
to
buy
their
promotion
package
in
order
to
receive
the
major
award
they
mislabled
my
address
and
i
did
not
receive
my
package
until
one
month
ago
i
was
mad
and
angry
about
how
it
took
them
so
long
to
get
my
package
so
i
wrote
them
a
letter
and
requested
for
a
refund
they
never
return
my
letter
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
out
their
telephone
number
through
operator
and
received
the
package
i
immediately
returned
the
package
and
wrote
them
another
letter
to
ask
for
refund
the
package
was
returned
because
they
address
they
put
on
the
package
was
incorrect
i
attempted
to
call
them
and
learnd
that
they
have
changed
their
telephone
number
it
took
me
at
least
phone
calls
to
find
out
their
new
number
but
they
refused
to
take
any
responsibility
i
spoke
to
their
manager
and
she
said
she
would
call
me
back
but
she
has
not
call
yet
but
i
was
able
to
get
their
address
from
their
front
desk
should
i
just
go
ahead
and
send
the
package
or
should
i
waite
until
they
call
me
back
i
know
there
are
several
people
on
the
net
has
experience
with
the
same
company
i
would
like
to
know
how
they
got
their
money
back
if
you

apology
printing
dear
fellow
usenet
users
i
would
like
to
give
a
formal
apology
for
posting
an
advertisement
about
my
printing
business
i
did
not
intend
this
to
be
an
advertisement
but
rather
an
offer
for
people
on
the
usenet
many
of
whom
use
printing
on
a
regular
basis
i
was
not
aware
that
this
is
not
legal
on
the
usenet
i
am
only
trying
to
put
myself
through
college
for
those
of
you
who
requested
information
i
will
write
to
you
privately
for
those
of
you
who
are
having
fun
flooding
my
mailbox
i
think
you
can
grow
up
to
offer
advice
is
one
thing

to
use
profanity
toward
me
is
another

i
dont
remember
if
it
was

senator
john

or
whether
or
not
it
was
dated
because
i
havent
looked
at
it
in
quite
a
while
currently
it
is
in

box
i
would
rather
sell
to
a
private
collector
rather
then
go
through
an
auction
house
such
as
christys
since
that
would
tend
to
take
away
from

much

hes
including

which
is
advised
for

since
it
costs

my

send

what

again
ive
used
the
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
can
certainly
understand
why
it
is
as
popular
as
it
is
ive
been
using
one
for
a
little
while
and
although
i
had
some
problems
with
it
recently
i
should
also
point
out
that
the
particular
one
i
was
using
had
been
on
the
road
for
two
years
and
had
truly
been
used
during
that
time
this
is
the
same
exact
dat
machine
that
was
lugged
around
the
us
and
canada
to
record
the

for
their
recent

album

i

at

half
a

professional
musicians

record
labels
in
sf
who
use
that
model
and
have
been
for
a

my
problem
is
that
everyone
i
know
already
has
one
nuff
said
the
reason

not

that
i

dont
have

but
you

might
and
it
also
has
some

whistles
that
the
doesnt
i
am
also
paying

cyrix

intel
clones
beware
from
what
i
understand
neither
the
amd
or
cyrix
are
clones
of
the
intel
they
are
using
the
name
because
they
run
as
fast
as
a
intel
they
do
not
have
exactly
the
same
instuction
set
nor
do
they
fit
into
the
same
socket
most
are
very
fast
without
coprocessors
amd
recent
won
the
appeal
against
intel
to
use
their
microcode
so
they
should
be
putting
out
real
chips
in
the
near
future

the

about

that

this
can
be
done
as
well
the

will

along

everything
works
perfectly
the

in
case
a
deal
is
a
lemon
hi
to
all
since
all
of
you
could
also
be
a
seller
as
well
as
a
buyer
id
like
to
bring
this
issue
for
discussion
what
would
be
the
best
solution
in
case
a
deal
became
a
lemon
as
i
understand
most
people
selling
things
over
the
net
do
not
grant
a
warrantyi
am
in
such
a
situation
that
the
seller
did
not
state
whether
a
warranty
would
be
granted
or
not
and
the
item
i
received
is
out
of
order
the
seller
insisted
that
it
was
in
good
condition
when
he
sent
it
and
so
would
just
return
half
ofthe
amount
that
i
paid
if
i
send
the
item
back
to
him
and
after
he
is
sured
it
is
bad
is
this
reasonable
basically
i
would
like
to
believe
the
seller
tells
the
truth
also
i
am
positively
to
say
that
ive
not
done
anything
wrong
which
might
cause
the
failure
of
the
thing
my
assumption
here
is
everyone
is
honest
so
rule
out
the
possibility
that
either
one
of
the
two
parties
or
both
are
liars
i
would
like
to
hear
your
opinion
either
in
here
or
directly
respond
to
my
email
address
i
know
there
is
such
a
risk
that
you
could
lose
money
but
how
can
we

just
how

why

they
are

could
you
please
forward
this
message
to
them
thanks
kris
i
was
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
those
removeablefrontpanels
were
to
make
the
radio
useless
and
thus
discourage
theft
that
is
if
the
cover
were
removed
by
the
owner
and
taken
along
whenever
the
car
was
left
if
those
covers
were
sold
for
anything
remarkably
less
than
the
radio
originally
costs
or
even
sold
at
all
then
the
above
discouragement
wouldnt
be
so
great
i
personally
would
be
unhappy
if
i
bought
a
radio
like
that
thinking
that
removing
the
cover
greatly
depreciated
the
radios
value
and
the
covers
were
sold
by
the
company

other

wanted

know

there

a

honest

good
people
out
there
even
outside

not
that
i
think
we
shouldnt
hear
about
the
bad
deals
but
it
would
be
nice
to
hear
some
good
news
once
in
a
while
after
seeing
his
post
on
one
of
the
for
sale
groups
i
mailed
mr
mark
miller
a
request
for
his
copy
of
wordperfect
for
dos
he
suggested
a
price
of
in
his
ad
but
when
i
phoned
him
he
quoted
plus
shipping
that
sounded
more
than
fair
to
me
so
i
told
him
that
i
would
send
him
a
check
the
next
day
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
logged
into
my
account
the
following
day
and
found
a
message
from
him
saying
that
it
had
already
been
sold
after
i
had
just
mailed
the
money
order
after
another
email
message
to
him
he
apologized
and
assured
me
that
it
was
a
mistake
i
was
the
one
who
he
was
holding
it
for
he
sent
the
package
as
soon
as
he
got
the
money
along
with
a
letter
stating
a
transfer
of
license
this
wasnt
good
enough
for
wordperfect
so
i
asked
him
to
fill
out
one
of
their
forms
no
problem
we
thought
it
took
three
times
to
get
it
to
the
right
address
my
fault
anyway
he
mailed
me
the
form
for
my
signature
and
included
a
workbook
that
i
had
no
idea
was
included
in
the
deal
again
he
apologized
for
not
sending
it
before
i
now
have
the
worlds
best
word
processor
and
a
renewed
hope
in
the
world
that
there
are
a
few
good
ones
left
i
recoend
that
if
you
ever
see
that
mark
is
selling
anything
thatat
you
may
want
give
him
a
call
if
i
had
the
choice
i
would
purchase

kenneth
dwayne

writes
i
had
the
front
panel
of
my
car
stereo
stolen
this
weekend
i
need
to
buy
the
front
panel
of
a
sony
car
stereo
i
was
my
understanding
that
the
purpose
of
those
removeablefrontpanels
were
to
make
the
radio
useless
and
thus
discourage
theft
that
is
if
the
cover
were
removed
by
the
owner
and
taken
along
whenever
the
car
was
left
if
those
covers
were
sold
for
anything
remarkably
less
than
the
radio
originally
costs
or
even
sold
at
all
then
the
above
discouragement
wouldnt
be
so
great
i
personally
would
be
unhappy
if
i
bought
a
radio
like
that
thinking
that
removing
the
cover
greatly
depreciated
the
radios
value
and
the
covers
were
sold
by
the
company
or
other
legitimate
source
cheaply
the
front
covers
should
be
available
from
sony
check
with
a
local
car
stereo
shop
you
will
probably
definitely
have
to
provide
the
units
serial
number
and
hopefully
you
had
registered
the
warranty
card
i
dont
know
the
cost
but
replacements
have
to
be
available
to
people
who
damage
the
face
cover
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
it
can
be
replaced
as
to
deterring
theft
when
i
worked
for
a
stereo
shop
we
referred
the
customer
to
a
sony
number
we
would
not
sell
the
face
nor
did
we
have
them
available
most
people
who
came
in
asking
for
the
face
cover
or
a
pullout
sleave
for
that
matter
would
look
very
disheartened
to
find
that
they
acquired
a
deck
they
couldnt
use
if
theft
occurs
with
these
decks
notify
sony

reminding
us
that
advertising
is
not
done
on
internet
as
a
matter
of
fact
dj
it
does
make
a
difference
almost
a
half
million
new
users
joined
the
internet
last
year
many
of
them
are
commercial
businesses
the
ban
on
commercial
use
of
internet
is
no
more
jack
there
is
a
difference
between
using
the
network
for
commercial
purposes
and
advertising
in
newsgroups
business
communication
is
okay
advertising
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
users
around
the
planet
who
have
no
desire
to
receive
advertising
is
not
okay
those
of
us
who
pay
for
internet
access
are
constrained
only
by
our
innate
good
taste
and
no
have
no
administrator
to
guide
us
i
suspect
that
a
site
which
generated
a
large
volume
of
material
not
in
anybodys
good
taste
would
find
itself
getting
a
lot
of
attention
it
didnt
want
you
may
belong
to
the
public
library
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
can
deface
the
books
disorder
the
stacks
or
disturb
the
other
patrons
youre
constrained
by
the
same
rules
that
the
rest
of
the
users
many
academic
and
military
who
get
irritable
about
a
network
for
which
they
pay
with
tax
and
grant
money
carrying
private
business
advertising
follow
there
are
secret
masters
here
just
like
everywhere
else
theyre
not
as
obvious
as
the
ones
on
prodigy
but
theyre
here
no
doubt
at
some
point
the
internet
like
everything
else
will
become
grotty
enough
to
carry
advertising
at
that
time
i
hope
it
is
confined
to
its

not

the

ground

reserving
it

tripe
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
significant
improvement
in
addition
to
improper
etiquette
this
product
is
a
mailing

used
for
generating
junk

so
either
they
target
it
well
enough
to
pay
for
it
in

words
they
manage
to
send
it

people
who

the

in

case
it
is
junk
only
for

and
the

what

leave

can

only

well
im
not

id
go

i
agree

the
question
is
how

in

not
commercial

this

can
hear
a

ok
great

how
often
does
that

how

good

how
much
is
someone

pay
for
it

is
maybe
while
a
commercial
quality
one
is
maybe
is
the
increased
reliability
and
performance
worth
times
the

in

only
the

can
answer
that
question
and

has

if

is

you

more

optonica
tuner
and
integrated
amp
forsale
i
have
an
old
optonica
tuner
and
integrated
amp
that
i
no
longer
use
the
integrated
amp
section
does
not
work
right
now
but
should
not
cost
much
to
fix
i
believe
that
it
is
just
a
chip
i
have
used
it
as
a
preamp
and
it
works
great
this
is
a
very
nice
looking
and
well
built
set
they
both
are
low
profile
but
the
amp
is
rather
heavy
the
tuner
is
in
fine
working
condition
and
is
a
match
to
the
amp
the
amp
is
rated
at
these
peices
went
for
about
new
i
would
like
to
get
obo
for
the
pair
if
anybody
has
knowledge
anough
to
fix
the
amp
i
have
had
an
estimate
done
that
it
should
cost
less
than
in
parts
please
email
me
if
you
are
interested
i
will
be
moving
back
home
for
the
summer
and
will
sell
it
back
there

want
to
get
rid
of
this
stuff
ok
heres
the
list
meg
scsi
hard
drive
conner
model
i
bought
this
from
a
guy
at
a
swap
meet
to
use
with
my
macintosh
unfortunately
i
cant
seem
to
get
it
to
work
with
the
scsi
controller
in
my
computer
the
guy
tested
it
with
his
pc
and
printed
out
a
copy
of
the
norton
disk
doctor
report
which
says
it
has
no
bad
sectors
ill
send
you
a
copy
i
was
dumb
enough
not
to
get
his
phone
number
so
i
cant
return
it
to
him
the
drive
has
many
jumpers
on
it
which
i
dont
know
how
to
set
so
maybe
thats
the
problem
i
was
quite
disappointed
that
it
didnt
work
so
im
trying
to
minimize
my
losses
meg
scsi
hard
drive
conner
model
same
situation
as
above
i
bought
both
of
these
drives
from
the
same
guy
despite
the
different
model
numbers
they
are
the
same
exact
drive
same
report
from
ndd
i
have
one
for
each
drive
will
be
included
meg
sony
scsi
hard
drive
sony
model
the
drive
mechanism
is
completely
trashed
this
hard
drive
was
in
my
computer
mac
se
and
had
a
stiction
problem
well
repeated
banging
on
the
side
of
the
computer
resulted
in
a
head
crash
yes
metal
scraping
metal
which
was
not
too
pleasant
to
listen
to
still
the
scsi
controller
card
is
in
good
working
order
and
can
be
used
for
parts
or
a
project
meg
seagate
hh
scsi
hard
drive
model
i
originally
bought
this
drive
because
it
had
a
small
stiction
problem
and
i
though
that
i
could
fix
it
well
i
determined
that
the
drive
mechanism
was
fine
and
that
it
was
a
controller
problem
motor
controller
wasnt
sending
proper
signals
well
after
taking
the
controller
off
the
drive
looking
at
it
and
putting
it
back
together
i
realized
that
i
accidentally
severed
one
of
the
small
flat
cables
that
connect
the
drive
to
the
controller
i
tried
to
solder
it
but
im
not
that
good
at
soldering
so
i
couldnt
do
it
worked
perfectly
before
i
messed
up
i
used
it
as
a
temporary
drive
when
the
sony
above
crashed
on
me
also
loaded
the
drive
with
about
twenty
mac
applications
worth
well
over
claris
cad
ms
word
think
c
excel
and
many
others
i
think
all
it
needs
is
a
resoldering
of
that
cable
you
also
get
all
the
software
on
the
drive
if
you
can
accept
being
a
pirate
i
only
ask
that
you
delete
my
data
files
from
the
drive
i
was
really
angry
when
i
broke
that
connection
and
then
couldnt
fix
it
i
just
dont
have
time
to
play
with
it
any
more
att
isdn
modem
this
is
for
use
on
digital
phone
systems
if
you
know
what
this
is
or
would
like
technical
information
on
it
let
me
know
i
have
some
tech
documents
on
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
thing
as
an
att
digital
phone
but
without
the
phone
part
it
seems
to
be
in
working
order
passes
self
test
perfectly
ok
i
have
no
idea
how
this
is
worth
let
me
know
if
youre
interested
motorola
coprocessor
i
havent
tested
this
one
out
yet
but
if
anyone
is
interested
i
will
get
it
tested
out
to
make
sure
that
it
works
i
had
trouble
using
it
with
my
accelerator
board
but
then
i
spoke
to
the
manufacturer
of
the
board
and
found
out
it
couldnt
be
used
without
another
controller
chip
when
i
was
looking
around
to
buy
one
new
the
prices
were
around
i
will
guarantee
this
to
work
cga
card
halflength
wasnt
working
last
time
i
checked
although
i
think
i
was
using
a
bad
monitor
floppy
drive

type
guaranteed
to
work
because
when
i
took
it
out
of
the
pc
it
was
working

toshiba
model
number
guaranteed
to
work
came
out
of
same
pc
as
above
floppy
drives
cant
guarantee
that
these
will
work
i
dont
even
know
if
they
are
low
or
high
density
drives
i
dont
have
any
method
of
testing
them

acg
theres
another
number
on

panasonic

agg
theres
also
another
number
on
it
toshiba
model
number
virtually
identical
to
the
one
above
each
drive
drive
these
things
are
proprietary
so
i
cant
test
it
but
i
think
it
works
not
sure
if
its
high
density
or
low
density
but
i
suppose
someone
who
is
looking
for
one
would
know
model
number
i
think
these
things
are
expensive
to
replace
mfm
hard
drive
controller
cards
ive
got
three
of
these
and
i
have
no
way
of
testing
them
two
of
them
are
cards
and
one
is
a
sixteen
bit

a
floppy

in

like
this
before
and
it
was

didnt

yet
and
the

costs
will
be

will

refused

this
posting
reminded
me
about
a
longstanding
question
ive
had
does
it
pay
to
consider
an
underwater
camera
for
pictures
taken
on
land
but
in
harsh
environments
eg
rain
snow
heat
cold
mud
dust
or
are
the
lenses
etc
all
tuned
for
the
refractive
index
of
water
i
have
had
a
nikon
since
unfortunately
it
is
no
longer
made
it
is
a
p
s
sealed
to
resist
water
to
a
depth
of
feet
it
is
not
really
an
underwater
camera
but
it
has
been
great
in
wet
and
dusty
conditions
it
takes
aa
batteries
hooray
it
has
the
solid
heavy
feel
of
oldstyle
nikons
and
has
taken
all
the
abuse
i
have
been
able
to
give
it
this
includes
a
lot
of
water
rain
river
and
sea
desert
and
beach
sand
as
well
as
being
used
as
a
weapon
against
a
mugger
shouting
and
swinging
the
camera
by
the
strap
didnt
scare
the
mugger
away
hitting
him
with
the
flying

this
is

never

that

created
for
the
can
be
played
on
the
this
has
been
the
main
midi
controller
in
my
studio
for
quite
a
while
now
it
has
performed
ably
in
that
role
and
has
also
been
a
heavily
used
sound
source
at
the
same
time
the
seems
to
have
been
designed
with
this
role
in
mind
and
it
works
very
well
with
my
software
sequencer
wincake
in
its
multitimbral
mode
from
a
synthesis
point
of
view
this
machine
is
a
hybrid
it
uses
looped
short
samples
there
are
of
them
as
sources
then
these
waves
are
processed
with
a
sophisticated
dcfdca
arrangement
the
is
capable
of
great
things
because
of
its
analog
lowpass
filter
simply
put
it
makes
fabulous
analog
synth
sounds
but
unlike
most
good
analog
synths
it
has
a
very
thorough
midi
implementation
so
that
it
works
very
well
with
a
midi
sequencer
what
i
really
like
most
about
this
thing
is
that
it
is
capable
of
making
a
very
wide
range
of
sounds
this
is
about
years
old
mfg
date
it
does
have
an
sequencer
but
like
most
onboard
sequencers
it
is
a
pain
to
use
so
i
have
avoided
it
reason
for

am

because
i
recently
joined

once

this

this

just
so
no
one
is
misled
the
vast

of
usenetters
are
honest
and
good
people
in
fact
in
the
latest
study
of
all
netdeals
went
off
smoothly
without
a
hitch
its
just
that
the
few
bad
ones
are
what
get
all
the
publicity
agreed
i
have
yet
to
run
into
a
problem
in
deals
over
the
net
and
i
have
bought
things
from
cds
plenty
to
a
full
computer
the
only
small
problem
that
i
have
had
was
with
ups
rather
than
the
seller
besides
complaints
are
always
what
get
the
publicitywhen
something
goes
wrong
people
complain
rarely
have
i
seen
posts
stating
how
well
a
deal
went
