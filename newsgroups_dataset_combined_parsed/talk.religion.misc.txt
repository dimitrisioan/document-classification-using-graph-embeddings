i
just
recently
realized
that
i
am
bisexual
and
also
just
recently
returned
to
religion
and
have
a
good
friend
who
has
pointed
out
to
me
that
homosexuality
is
a
sin
in
the
bible
well
i
dont
see
how
it
could
be
considered
a
sin
first
of
all
as
far
as
i
know
only
male
homosexuality
is
explicitly
mentioned
in
the
bibles
so
youre
off
the
hook
there
i
think
in
any
event
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
many
denominations
who
do
not
consider
a
persons
sexual
identification
of
gaylesbianbisexual
as
an
immoral
lifestyle
choice
also
i
have
always
been
a
somewhat
liberal
feminist
and
am
prochoice
and
it
seems
that
being
prochoice
and
being
religious
dont
mix
either
i
am
told
this
is
another
misconception
you
are
not
being
told
the
whole
story
my
former
minister
is
a
lesbian
and
i
know
personally
and
professionally
several
openly
gay
and
lesbian
ministers
i
am
a
unitarianuniversalist
and
like
most
others
in
my
denomination
am
prochoice
you
neednt
go
looking
to
the
unitarian
universalists
which
is
a
liberal
religion
for
acceptance
of
your
sexual
identification
and
prochoice
views
however
there
are
many
of
us
who
believe
in
spirituality
and
freedom
of
conscience
good
luck
on
your
journey

kills

not

about

i
think
this

must
be
a

very
maliable

suitable
for
any
occassion
since
it
seems
one
can
take

one
wants
to
go
with

follow
whichever
bits
one
pleases
and
reinterpret
the
bits
that
dont
match
with
ones
desires
it
is
in

so
convenient
that
were
i
capable
of
believing
in

i
might
consider
going
for
some
brand

the
only
difficulty
left

christianity

paul
harvey
for
a
while
i
was
puzzled
by
the
the
concept
of
adam
and
eve
coming
to
know
good
and
evil
this
is
how
i
resolved
it
within
gods
universe
each
action
evokes
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
there
can
be
no
good
without
evil
as
an
opposite
so
the
issue
is
not
what
you
do
but
to
whom
you
give
your
allegiance
that
is
why
even
in
this
sinful
state
when
we
perform
an
evil
act
while
we
are
submitted
to
god
he
does
not
place
that
sinful
act
to
our
account
rom
in
the
same
vein
you
can
perform
all
the
good
deeds
in
the
book
if
your
life
is
not
under
gods
control
you
are
still
sinning

now

a
good

said

we
have
one
generation
to
do
it
or
to
die
many
immigrant
groups
struggle
to
maintain
an
identity
in
a
strange
land
but
for
zoroastrians
it
is
an
especially
poignant
concern
their
religion
has
been
around
for
perhaps
years
a
heritage
so
deep
it
scarcely
seems
comprehensible
in
a
state
where
historical
sites
are
sometimes
less
than
years
old
it
was
the
religion
of
the
great
persian
empire
under
kings
cyrus
and
darius
and
tradition
says
that
when
christ
was
born
about
years
later
he
was
honored
by
a
visit
from
three
zoroastrian
priests
the
magi
scholars
say
many
key
beliefs
of
christians
jews
and
muslims
can
be
traced
to
the
teachings
of
zoroaster
the
zoroastrian
prophet
yet
with
only
about
zoroastrians
in
the
entire
world
they
are
a
miniscule
minority
in
every
country
in
which
they
live
survival
as
a
people
is
very
much
on
their
minds
ironically
local
zoroastrians
fear
that
the
almost
unlimited
tolerance
of
the
united
states
may
do
what
hundreds
of
years
of
persecution
followed
by
nearly
years

religious
segregation

their
young
people
to
stop
thinking
of
themselves
as
zoroastrians
zoroastrians
do
not
believe
theirs
is
the
only
right
religion
and
they
actually
shun
the
notion
of
trying

win
converts
so
if

they

leader
among
zoroastrians
who
came
here
from
india
its
important
for
everybody
irish
scottish
americans
it
gives
meaning
to
life
you
dont
have
to
depend
on
the
majority
community

give
you
respect
you
can
fall
back
on
your
own
identity
for
zoroastrians
theres
much
to
be
proud
of
their
prophet
zoroaster
seeking
to
make
sense
of
a
culture
in
which
animal
sacrifice
to
multiple
gods
was
common
preached
that
there
was
only
one
god
a
good
one
zoroastrians
call
their
god
ahura
mazda
which
translates
as
lord
of
wisdom
and
light
good
vs
evil
zoroaster
saw
life
as
a
constant
struggle
between
good
and
evil
with
the
good
eventually
winning
men
and
women
could
join
in
the
battle
for
good
he
said
and
he
warned
that
they
would
inevitably
suffer
consequences
such
as
shame
and
sorrow
if
they
did
wrong
he
preached
honesty
charity
kindness
to
animals
respect
for
the
environment
hard
work
equality
of
men
and
women
basic
virtues
preached
by
prophets
of
many
religions
but
zoroaster
was
perhaps
unusual
in
that
he
told
his
followers
not
to
follow
him
blindly
he
demanded
they
think
for
themselves
in
fact

so
its
not

that
zoroastrians

serve

seem

an

the

you

is
of

than
most
i
agree
which
is
why
ive
asked
for
help
with
it
the
reason
im
working
on
this
list
is
because
ive
recently
had
one
too
many
christians
tell
me
the
bible
contains
no
contradictions
whatsoever
they
believe
that
its
true
and
that
it
describes
reality
perfectly
and
even
predicts
history
before
it
happens
before
i
can
carry
on
any
sort
of
meaningful
conversation
with
these
people
ive
got
to
show
them
with
concrete
evidence
that
the
bible
is
not
nearly
as
airtight
as
they
thought
i
hope
to
do
that
with
this
list
specifically
when
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
genesis
contains
two
contradictory
creation
stories
i
usually
get
blank

ive
never

acknowledge

these
topics
are
all
discussed
in
the
vedas
in
fact
the
original
knowledge
of
all
these
topics
comes
from
the
vedas
therefore
they
are
not
newage
at
all
they
are
rather
old
by
any
standards
nor
is
the
popularity
they
are
currently
experiencing
something
new
one
would
think
that
the
vedas
would
be
very
popular
among
newagers
since
all
the
things
you
mention
above
are
thoroughly
described
in
them
isnt
that
interesting
in
the
jewish
tradition
you
are
incredibly
wrong
they
originate
in
the
torah
and
with
jewish
ancestors
specifically
the
patriarch
abraham
zl
that
knowledge
was
sent
east
to
india
and
china
when
abraham
gave
gifts
the
commentators
to
jewish
scripture
say
this
was
the
knowledge
of
the
occult
arts
to
all
the
rest
of
his
children
when
he
sent
them
away
to
the
east
this
assured
that
isaac
only
who
remained
with
abraham
would
inherit
his
most
important
spiritual
gifts
what
eventually
became
judaism
so
you
see
other
religions
can
have
very
parochial
views
too
by
the
jewish
view
you
are
very
mistaken
your
scripture
are
not
scripture
your
gods
are
not
gods
your
practices
a
jumble
of
errors
that
lead
people
to
idol
worship
and
away
from
god
that
doesnt
stop
us
from
respecting
you
to
the
extent
of
not
trying
to
convert
you
or
proselytize
you
and
being
willing
to
dialog
in
a
respectful
manner
were
content
to
let
you
live
the
way
you
care
to
live
as
long
as
you
leave
us
be
we
are
happy
to
coexist
as
long
as
you
give
us
the
same
right
but
your
incredible
rudeness
and
violent
nature
seems
to
preclude
that
too
bad
is
this
typical
of
your
religion
however
there
is
one
difference
between
the
newage
practitioner
and
the
actual
follower
of
the
vedic
teachings
the
typical
newager
desires
to
acquire
all
the
material
powers
and
opulences
mentioned
in
the
vedas
without
referring
to
their
source
the
lord
he
wants
the
kingdom
of
god
without
god
he
wants
personal
power
without
the
responsibility
of
acknowledging
its
source
without
the
person
from
whom
that
power
comes
in
other
words
he
is
just
plain
selfish
you
are
a
most
presumptuous
fellow
how
dare
you
presume
that
the
typical
new
ager
doesnt
acknowledge
god
and
is
selfish
what
trite
selfrighteous
egoful
garbage
there
are
buddhists
christians
jews
and
those
of
many
other
religions
here
on
this
newsgroups
for
whom
your
words
are
simple
slander
the
vedic
follower
on
the
other
hand
knows
that
no
matter
what
one
desires
one
must
worship
god
and
the
vedas
give
a
complete
description
of
exactly
who
is
god
so
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
in
his
identification
for
this
reason
the
parts
of
the
vedas
that
deal
directly
with
the
personality
of
godhead
are
not
very
popular
among
newagers
and
anyone
who
presents
the
complete
vedas
as
they
are
is
branded
as
an
evangelist
as
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
even
though
he
is
simply
presenting
the
unadulterated
vedic
teachings
of
course
from
the
jewish
perspective
you
are
incredibly
wrong
wed
say
that
there
is
no
godhead
just
created
beings
who
may
be
enjoying
a
good
laugh
at
your
expense
a
thief
takes
from
others
and
says
this
is
mine
a
newager
takes
from
god
and
says
this
is
mine
such
a
false
mystic
must
be
careful
to
avoid
coming
in
contact
with
the
real
owner
of
the
things
he
has
stolen
consequently
he
invents
an
explanation
for
these
things
that
conveniently
omits
the
identity
of
their
owner
the
lord
in
other
words
he
lies
about
where
he
got
them
so
not
only
are
we
selfish
we
are
also
thieves
and
liars
and
you
expect
any
of
us
to
pay
attention
to
you
and
your
religion
why
not
call
us
more
name
maybe
then
well
all
convert
in
gratefullness
however
the
lord
is
very
merciful
and
he
sends
his
servants
to
remind
the
newager
of
his
own
identity
as
spirit
soul
the
eternal
servant
of
god
hence
although
unwanted
the
evangelist
continues
to
broadcast
the
complete
truth
you
delude

it

it

i

do

if

then
you

admit

yes
i
know
you
will
say

your

correct

tells
you
that
only
agents
acting
in

of
your

have
the
right
of
interference
however
other
people
will
say
that
you
have
misinterpreted
the
word
of
god
and
that
they
are
the

that
you

so
it
goes

these
people
hurt
their
own
bodies
why
cant
they
hurt
other
peoples
bodies
too
me
because
other
people
might
not
want
to
be
hurt
hudson
and
hurting
them
against
their
will
is
a
violation
of
choice
hudson
so
why
is
someone
elses
will
such
a
big
deal
if
morality
is
all
relative
i
dont
believe
i
ever
said
that
morality
was
all
relative
what
i
said
was
that
i
can
make
my
mind
up
on
my
own
thank
you
and
that
you
dont
have
the
right
to
tell
others
what
to
think
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
in
most
moral
systems
there
is
a
respect
for
human
life
and
the
dignity
of
the
person
it
is
all
the
stuff
besides
these
points
that
forms
the
core
of
the
disagreement
between
primitive
moral
absolutists
like
yourself
and
the
rest
of
us
hudson
maybe
the
insane
lover
of
pain
might
reason
if
other
people
experienced
enough
pain
they
might
learn
to
enjoy
it
too
fine
there
is
still
the
clinical
definition
of
crazy
and
this
also
involves
a
violation
of
free
will
because
the
insane
lover
of
your
little
example
would
be
inflicting
pain
on
a
nonwilling
subject
try
again
hudson
you
have
to
have
other
premises
to
derive
this
me
no
you
dont
that
is
a
patently
false
statement
hudson
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
premise
about
choice
or
selfawareness
no
you
do
not
i
demonstrated
to
you
the
example
of
the
football
team
which
doesnt
require
premises
about
freedom
of
choice
or
sentienceselfawareness
as
i
said
you
are
wrong
and
you
dont
seem
to
know
much
about
moral
systems
if
i
were
you
i
would
take
david
bolds
suggestion
and
do
some
reading
on
the
subject
before
you
try
preaching
about
it
subject
re
question
for
those
with

hudson
yes
you
do
who
is
to
say
that
it
is
immoral
for
onesself
to
experience
pain
or
to
be
hurt
in
some
other
way
maybe
unpleasant
but
that
doesnt
say
anything
about
morality
it
violates
free
will
hudson
me
you
can
derive
the
immorality
of
hurting
someone
else
entirely
from
selfish
motives
i
can
say
for
example
that
it
is
wrong
to
hurt
other
people
because
that
makes
them
less
productive
members
of
society
hudson
why
is
making
someone
a
less
productive
member
of
society
immoral
hudson
you
are
screwing
up
again
morality
does
not
i
say
again
does
not
define
only
right
and
wrong
it
also
defines
acceptable
social
behavior
without
any
overtones
of
good
and
evil
picking
up
your
trash
is
not
really
a
rightwrong
moral
issue
in
the
eternal
sense
of
good
and
evil
yet
it
is
moral
in
the
sense
that
it
is
acceptable
social
behavior
your
definition
of
the
word
morality
is
what
is
causing
you
to
trip
over
yourself
here
me
and
since
i
selfish
being
that
i
am
want
to
maximize
my
gains
from
society
i
will
not
do
anything
to
another
member
of
society
if
that
action
might
cut
down
on
how
much
benefit
i
can
derive
from
society
hudson
why
is
your
benefit
somehow
related
to
morality
again
your
definition
is
causing
you
to
shoot
yourself
in
the
foot
hudson
what
about
if
someone
feels
that
their
own
personal
benefit
is
enhanced
more
than
it
would
be
damaged
by
depleting
the
overall
resources
of
society
maybe
something
might
hurt
society
but
it
would
help
him
immensly
that
is
irrational
thinking
there
may
also
be
people
out
there
who
think
that
death
by
atomic
destruction
is
a
sublime
and
wonderful
thing
i
am
not
going
to
let
them
execute
that
idea
just
because
they
want
to
do
it
simply
because
i
let
people
make
up
their
minds
about
what
morals
they
have
doesnt
prevent
me
from
spotting
and
stopping
a
madman
when
i
see
one
hudson
and
even
then
i
will
only
stop
him
when
he
interferes
with
me
and
my
life
that
is
the
difference
between
me
and
you
you
want
to
interfere

hudson
the
central
character
in
dostoevskys
novel
crime
and
punishment
r
something
or
other
reasoned
that
if
killed
this
old
jewish
woman
and
stole
her
money
to
educate
and
establish
himself
financially
he
could
make
a
great
contribution
to
society
he
reasoned
that
she
was
not
of
much
profit
to
society
she
just
collected
rents
and
hoarded
money
one
of
the
central
points
of
any
thats
any
moral
system
is
that
is
has
to
be
internally
consistent
by
killing
her
the
character
had
to
accept
the
premise
that
the
ends
justify
the
means
if
he
accepted
that
premise
then
in
order
to
be
consistent
he
must
accept
the
idea
that
some
day
another
person
may
apply
the
same
standard
to
his
life
now
if
he
is
unwilling
to
accept
this
premise
which
he
will
not
be
willing
to
accept
then
he
has
behaved
inconsistently
with
his
own
moral
standard
me
football
example
deleted
hudson
now
suppose
a
freshman
on
the
bench
will
only
get
to
play
if
one
of
the
players
in
the
fieldon
the
court
is
injured
or
killed
this
freshman
wants
to
play
in
the
big
game
so
a
talent
scout
can
see
him
if
he
hurts
a
player
on
the
team
it
might
slightly
lessen
the
chances
of
the
team
to
win
but
he
might
gain
great
personal
benefit
so
operating
on
purely
selfish
immorally
selfish
motives
he
arranges
for
a
sniper
to
shoot
a
team
player
in
the
leg
he
gets
to
play
in
front
of
the
talent
scout
did
that
freshman
behave
morally
selfish
intentions
may
sometimes
generate
apparently
moral
actions
but
not
always
two
problems
right
off
the
bat
the
problem
with
your
analogy
is
that
it
doesnt
address
the
goal
that
i
started
with
winning
the
game
playing
in
front
of
the
talent
scout
winning
the
game
try
creating
the
same
analogy
and
keep
the
ultimate
goal
the
same
will
you
the
internal
consistency
question
is
also
not
addressed
if
the
freshman
wants
to
do
this
to
other
people
then
he
has
to
accept
the
fact
that
it
may
happen
to
him
one
day
if
he
is
unwilling
then
he
has
violated
his
own
moral
standard
subject
re
question
for
those
with
popular
morality
hudson
and
from
a
materialistic
point
of
view
it
could
be
said
that
the
nervous
system
is
just
matter
what
is
wrong
with
producing
chemical
reactions
in
matter
because
this
matter
is
different
it
is
alive
and
selfaware
and
it
feels
pain
hudson
if
all
morality
were
relative
big
hairy
deal
as
i
said
you
appear
to
be
the
only
person
saying
that
all
morality
is
relative
most
people
i
know
do
hold
some
absolutes
in
their
moral
system
i
personally
believe
that
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
the
right
of
free
will
are
absolutes
i
recognize
that
there
are
some
moral
systems
around
which
dont
accept
this
i
reject
them
as
dangerous
and
antisocial
nazism
some
forms
of
communism
fundamentalist
xtianityno
thats
not
a
slam
but
for
the
most
part
almost
every
moral
system
agrees
on
these
two
points
me
and
the
sky
and
everything
in
it
everything
that
was
created
came
out
of
god
everything
including
this
matter
is
part
of
god
therefore
is
it
wrong
to
put
parts
of
god
in
a
test
tube
and
make
it
go
through
reactions
isnt
that
a
form
of
blasphemy
hudson
generally
christians
believe
in
a
creatorcreation
distinction
other
religions
believe
in
one
big
whole
i
dont
accept
yor
premises
too
bad
i
know
im
right
so
i
get
to
enforce
my
view
upon
you
whether
you
like
my
premise
or
not
and
since
you
cant
prove
otherwise
there
isnt
even
an
intellectual
basis
for
your
resistance
to
accepting
my
viewpoint
hudson
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
as
long
as
it
doesnt
hurt
someone
else
becomes
more
and
more
relative
until
the
only
rule
that
is
left
is
i
will
do
what
i
want
to
do
no
matter
who
it
hurts
theres
a
big
jump
between
those
two
positions
and
you
know
it
very
well
dont
play
stupid
i
realize
that
youre
trying
to
dispute
what
you
call
popular
morality
by
using
what
you
think
is
logic
but
youre
stretching
this
a
bit
too
thin
hudson
i
dont
think
so
once
morality
becomes
relative
it
degenerates
i
am
saying
that
reasoning
that
it
is
generally
evil
to
hurt
other
people
is
bad
though
i
dont
think
it
is
sufficient
well
then
answer
me
this
you
seem
to
be
opposed
to
moral
relativism
as
you
call
it
because
it
has
the
capacity
to
degenerate
obviously
then
you
would
advocate
a
nonrelative
absolute
moral
system
whose
absolutist
moral
system
do
we
choose
how
do
we
come
to
this
decision
what
about
people
who
disagree
with
the
chosen
moral
system
hudson
but
if
morality
is
considered
to
be
relative
and
this
rule
isnt
based
on
anything
but
is
just
an
arbitrary
rule
people
might
abandon
it
fine
i
can
agree
with
most
of
what
you
typed
here
however
just
because
morality
gets
based
on
something
nonrelative
does
not
mean
that
we
have
to
pick
your
xtianity
as
its
base
we
can
start
a
morality
based
on
dignity
of
humans
freedom
of
choice
tolerance
etc
and
never
ever
rely
on
xtianity
for
anything
just
because
someone
has
a
consistent
moral
system
based
on
true
principles
does
not
mean
that
they
have
to
involve
xtianity
in
it
xtianity
certainly
does
not
have
a
monopoly
on
principles
of
behavior
indeed
fewer
religions
are
guiltier
of
violating
their
own
principles

no

your

hudson
if

choices
are
also
chemical

why
is

stuff
about
the

deleted
which
can
be
read
in

i
will
also
leave
it
up
to
other
lds
netters
to
take
mr

to
task
on
using
mormon
doctrine
to
declare
the
difinitive
word
on
what
the
lds
church
teaches
as
doctrine
hopefully
the
lds
netters
will
be
amiable
in
their
explanation
since
it
would
do
no
good
to
rebut
what
mr
weiss
has
stated
on
the
origin
of
the
nicene
creed
and
its
status
as
devine
and
inspired
i
say
no
good
because
it
cannot
be
proved
through
discussion
or
debate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
authors
of
the
creed
were
inspired
i
leave
you
it
will
be
some
time
before
i
post
again
with
the
following
thought
authored
by
eugene
england
professor
of
english
at
brigham
young
university
mr
england
wrote
the
following
as
part
of
a
book
review
section
in
this
peoples
magazine
spring
edition
i
conclude
with
a
little
sermon
because
i
believe
we
will
not
be
a
mormon
or
humanfamily
until
we
can
get
over
labeling
and
rejecting
each
other
with
terms
like
feminist
or
patriarchal
liberal
or
conservative
christian
or
nonchristian
hal
when
we
are
tempted
to
draw
a
circle
around
a
set
of
beliefs
and
traditions
and
styles
and
call
it
american
then
exclude
those
who
dont
fit
it
may
be
well
to
consider
that
perhaps
the
most
central
defining
characteristic
of
a
good
american
might
be
one
who
doesnt
draw
exclusive
circles
that
the
surest
way
of
excluding
ourselves
from
the
central
american
ideal
is
by
excluding
others
and
when
we
are
tempted
to
draw
a
circle
around
mormon
or
christian
to
decide
who
is
orthodox
and
who
isnt
by
how
much
they
agree
with
us
it
might
be
well
to
consider
that
the
central
pillar
of
christs
orthodoxy
is
our
ability
to
love
unconditionally
those
who
are
different
and
include
them
in
our
family
i
recently
spent
some
time
in
a
christian
bookstore
in
california
the
service
was
excellent
the
clerks
and
customers
all
smiling
neat
and
wellscrubbed
and
there
were
the
expected
wholesome
offerings
of
scriptural
commentaries
sentimental
fiction
and
collections
of
evangelistic
sermons
but
i
was
dismayed
to
find
how
much
shelf
space
was
given
to
attacking
others
often
viciouslywhether
the
political
left
our
modern
american
culture
or
other
religions
a
whole
section
was
devoted
to
cults
and
the
occult
and
as
you
might
expect
mormonism
was
right
there
under
the
same
rubric
and
indictment
often
by
the
same
authors
as
satanism
and
i
found
i
could
either
rent
or
buy
in
english
or
spanish
copies
of
the
god
makers
that
absurdly
inaccurate
even
libelous
but
very
popular
and
dangerous
antimormon
film
that
uses
exaclty
the
same
techniques
and
even
accusations
of
the
nazi
films
that
scapegoated
jews
in
the
it
seems
to
me
one
major
indication
that
a
person
is
a
genuine
convert
to
christ
and
his
redemptive
love
is
his
lack
of
paranoia
and
anxiety
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
i
john
i
have
always
been
pleased
that
the
lds
church
has
not
engaged
in
attacks
on
other
faiths
though
i
find
a
disheartening
increase
in
willingness
of
individual
mormons
to
engage
in
the
same
kinds
of
stereotyping
and
scapegoatingand
even
threats
of
coercive
actionas
the
religious
right
wing
has
launched
this
year
against
the
political
left
and
american
cultural
and
religious
styles
they
dont
like
it
is
a
fearful
irony
that
in
so
doing
mormons
take
common
cause
with
the
very
people
who
have
most
slanderously
attacked
mormonspeople
who
would
if
they
had
power
forcefully
restrict
mormons
rights
along
with
those
of
others
they
believe
to
be
evil
the
above
sermon
was
addressed
to
the
lds
audience
who
usually
subscribe
to
this

but
would
certainly
apply
to
all
of
us
who
rely
on
the
mercies
and
grace
of
jesus
christ
to
bring
us
back
into
his
arms

though
the
lds
church
claims
devine
authority
to
exercise
the
principles
of
the
restored
gospelas

the

does
not
claim
perfection

infallibility
in
how
those

from

when

turned
into

went

i
was
not
directly
going

come
up
with
a
moral
argument
for
the
existence

rather
i
was
trying
to
show
the
absurdity
of
atheistic
materialist
relatavists
trying
to
embrace
some
common
moral
system
as
though
it
were
absolute
man
knows
in
his
heart
that
there
is
right
and
wrong
we
have
all
inherited
this
knowledge
no
matter
how
absurd
it
is
to
suggest
that
a
common
moral
system
created
by
mankind
is
absolute
it
is
not
contrary
to
reason
to
suggest
that
a
common
moral
system
created
by
mankind
is
sensible
in
fact
for
the
bible
to
be
of
any
use
to
mankind
as
a
moral
code
it
must
be
interpreted
by
mankind
and
a
workable
moral
system
created
for
everyday
use
the
jewish
talmud
is
the
result
of
centuries
of
biblical
scholars
analysing
every
word
of
the
torah
to
understand
the
morality
behind
it
the
children
of
israel
were
given
a
very
strict
set
of
moral
civil
judicial
and
ceremonial
laws
to
follow
and
yet
this
was
clearly
not
enough
to
cover
every
instance
of
moral
dilemma
in
their
society
for
a
christian
the
situation
is
no
better
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
code
of
morality
that
we
have
from
the
judeo
christian
god
is
that
which
is
contained
in
the
bible
which
we
can
see
from
the
diverse
opinions
in
the
christian
newsgroups
is
not
clear
there
may
well
be
an
absolute
morality
defined
by
the
judeochristian
god
for
mankind
to
follow
but
it
seems
that
we
only
have
a
subset
simply
because
the
concept
was
written
down
by
man
this
leads
to
the
problem
of
defining
morality
for
our
society
if
we
take
the
divine
morality
then
we
have
a
code
of
practice
which
may
be
interpreted
in
many
different
ways
as
an
example
consider
the
immolation
of
heretics
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
which
allows
a
man
to
do
that
to
another
man
under
the
precept
to
administer
justice
if
we
take
an
agnostic
morality
then
we
have
a
code
of
practice
that
can
be
modified
to
suit
society
with
all
the
danger
that
this
implies
alternatively
we
could
take
the
basis
of
the
judeochristian
morality
and
interpretextend
this
to
create
and
justify
a
code
of
morality
which
suits
the
society
we
live
in
and
enables
the
people
to
live
righteously
as
many
christian
and
nonchristian
philosophers
have
done
whatever
the
driving
force
behind
the
definition
of
morality
for
our
society
i
think
the
important
aspect
is
the
result
david

oh
where

fragmentation
the
primary
problem
in
human
nature
is
a
fragmentation
of
being
humans
are
in
a
state
of
tension
a
tension
of
opposites
good
and
evil
are
the
most
thought
provoking
polarities
that
come
to
mind
the
bible
provides
us
with
many
examples
of
the
fragmentation
of
being
the
warring
opposites
within
us
are
a
product
of
mans
rebellion
against
god
which
is
described
so
vividly
in
the
pages
of
the
scriptures
man
was
created
with
the
order
to
become
a
god
those
were
the
words
of
st
basil
in
the
fourth
century
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
that
god
created
man
to
be
a
partaker
of
the
divine
nature
in
the
eastern
orthodox
church
this
is
called
theosis
or
deification
one
can
also
say
that
man
was
created
to
be
whole
ie
spirit
soul
and
body
operating
in
unison
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
is
a
picture
of
the
archetypal
humans
before
obtaining
moral
consciousness
theirs
was
a
harmonious
relationship
with
each
other
the
world
and
the
creator
that
innocent
harmony
was
shattered
when
they
disobeyed
god
their
natural
wholeness
falling
apart
into
two
seemingly
irreconcilable
halves
immediately
guilt
and
fear
was
manifested
in
their
lives
they
become
bound
to
hardship
toil
and
suffering
this
is
symbolized
in
their
exile
from
the
paradisiac
state
the
beast
in
the
jungle
does
not
possess
moral
consciousness
if
it
were
to
receive
this
selfawareness
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
its
paradisiac
state
would
also
be
destroyed
was
it
the
intention
of
the
creator
to
leave
man
in
this
state
of
innocence
all
the
days
of
his
existence
on
earth
or
was
the
gaining
of
selfawareness
carefully
staged
by
god
who
did
not
desire
that
his
masterpiece
mankind
be
a
blissful
idiot
god
must
have
known
that
for
mankind
to
achieve
any
kind
of
moral
value
he
must
pass
through
a
confrontation
with
the
opposites
there
is
no
other
way
to
achieve
union
with
god
jesus
christ
is
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
the
warring
polarities
he
was
the
perfectly
integrated
individual
reconciling
the
opposites
and
making
it
possible
for
us
to
be
integrated
ie
to
become
god
not
in
his
essence
but
in
his
energies
the
opposites
is
the
christian
problem

ok
db
by
the
way
mr

you
really
should
have
looked
in
the
index
of
your
bauerarndtgingrich
greek
lexicon
you
would
have
found
that
the
word
in
acts
for
lot
is
kleros
not
chorion
as
stated
by
mr
archer
and
nowhere
in
the
very
large
discussion
of
kleros
in
done
the
to
theological
dictionary
of
the
new
testament
by
bromley
is
the
meaning
burial
plot
discussed
it
discusses
the
forms
of
kleros
eg
kleros
kleroo
etc
and
the
various
meanings
of
kleros
eg
plot
of
land
and
inheritance
but
mentions
nothing
about
chorion
or
burial
plot
why
does
this
not
surprise
me
thus
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
good
thing
you
dumped
archer
as
a

it

you
dumped
archer
as
a

i
was
wrong
i
admit
that
i
do
not
have
a
handle
on
greek
grammar
and
thus
confused
kleros
the
second
to
last
word
in
acts
as
being
the
plot
of
land
discussed
in
actuality
it
is
chorion
which
is
the
last
word
acts
unfortunately
my
greek
dictionary
does
not
discuss
chorion
so
i
cannot
report
as

the
nuances
of
the
word
i
dont
know
if
someone
else
would
have
caught
this
though
i
am
sure
that
someone
would
be
able
to
do
so
but
i
have
an
aversion
to
disseminating
mistakes
especially
when
someone
else
might
use
that
mistake
to
prove
a
point
my
reply
vary
noble
of
you
dave
i
didnt
want
to
have
to
go
to
x
number
of
sources
to
show
you
wrong
although
i
am
researching
chorion
a
little
db
of
course
the
only
other
reference
mr
decenso
has
given
is
bullinger
and
bullinger
uses
such
ridiculous
exegisis
that
when
i
accused
mr
decenso
of
actually
believing
bullinger
he
replied
that
i
misquoted
him
and
you
maintain
that
you
find
such
exegesis
convincing
oh
dear
my
reply
your
misquotes
of
me
are
astounding
dave
read
the
beginning
of
this
part
of
my
response
to
see
what
i
really
said
in
my
posting
of
this
article
actually
mr
decenso
you
said
that
there
was
benefit
to
our
argument
in
that
it
caused
to
to
rediscover
bullingers
exegisis
i
did
not
realize
that
you
would
find
such
garbage
beneficial
unless
you
were
convinced
by
it
my
reply
thank
you
for
correcting
your
restating
of
my
points
db
and
mr
decenso
also
replied
dave
these
are
not
necessarily
my
views
they
are
bullingers
we
will
discuss
the
land
issue
in
later
posts
im
sure
im
only
responding
to
this
one
you
have
directed
re
bullingers
views
because
its
enjoyable
thus
i
apologize
for
thinking
that
even
mr
decenso
could
find
such
drek
convincinghe
should
specify
which
parts
of
bullinger
he
finds
convincing
and
quit
hiding
behind
a
disingenuous
mask
of
this
is
what
bullinger
believed
not
necessarily
what
i
believe
so
which
is
it
mr
decenso
do
you
find
the
exegisis
convincing
or
not
my
reply
one
of
my
purposes
in
debating
these
alleged
contradictions
with
you
and
others
is
to
diseminate
many
different
views
of
possible
reconciliations
raised
by
various
bible
scholars
and
students
alike
when
i
present
my
views
i
will
clearly
distinguish
them
from
now
on
db
of
course
without
archer
and
bullinger
we
find
that
mr
decenso
has
presented
no
greek
exegisis
at
all
and
mr
decenso
has
made
a
big
thing
about
my
not
referring
back
to
the
actual
greek
thus
we
find
this
demand
on
his
part
for
quality
greek
exegisis
to
be
a
hypocritical
requirement
my
reply
good
point
but
in
your
declaring
that
these
passages
are
contradictory
you
have
produced
only
superficial
reasonings
and
observations
nor
have
you
dug
deeper
im
glad
you
have
begun
in
this
post
i
will
begin
greek
studies
on
these
passages
in
more
depth
than
i
thought
necessary
as
well
db
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
at
what
mr
decenso
has
actually
used
as
evidence
now
we
know
what
he
claims
for
a
standard
as
he
has
stated
it
often
enough
a
the
text
itself
b
parallel
passages
c
other
pertinent
scriptures
d
historical
context
e
historical
content
f
other
pertinent

g

context
h
cultural
content
i
other
pertinent
cultural
info
j
grammatical
construction
k
hebrew
and
greek
word
studies
l
etc
but
are
these
actual
standards
he
has
used
or
simply
empty
hyperbole
lets
see
he
has
used
a
and
since
he
is
trying
to
reconcile
it
to
other
passages
we
see
that
he
has
also
used
b
on
the
other
hand
he
has
presented
no
use
of
d
historical
context
or
e
historical
content
or
f
other
pertinent
historical
info
or
g
cultural
context
or
h
cultural
content
or
i
other
pertinent
cultural
info
or
j
grammatical
construction
or
even
k
hebrew
and
greek
word
studies
remember
archer
and
bullinger
dont
count
thus
we
find
his
vaunted
criteria
for
exegisis
is
just
empty
mouthings
my
reply
question
do
you
find
such
criteria
important
if
so
do
you
plan
on
starting
to
use
them
to
the
best
of
your
ability
or
will
you
continue
to
present
shallow
observations
i
dont
mean
this
in
a
bad
way
at
this
point
in
our
debates
i
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
present
a
total
exegetical
analysis
of
these
passages
since
we
seem
to
keep
beating
around
the
bush
and
not
getting
into
the
core
of
the
verses
i
do
not
believe
it
necessary
to
use
many
of
the
above
criteria
to
refute
your
arguments
re
judas
in
acts
and
matthew
but
i
will
do
my
best
from
this
point
on
to
use
several
of
the
above
criteria
since
you
desire
me
to
i
hope
you
will
also
it
will
greatly
enhance
our
study
of
these
passages
db
the
only
thing
he
has
actually
used
beyond
the
passage
itself
is
any
other
passage
thus
mr
decenso
should
be
honest
and
note
that
most
of
his
list
is
red
herring
and
his
only
real
criteria
seems
to
be
a
the
text
itself
b
parallel
passages
my
reply
the
reason
is
simpleyou
are
mistating
the
passages
you
claim
that
the
passages
contradict
one
another
i
do
not
see
the
passages
contradicting
one
another
they
may
very
well
be
complimentary
as
many
scholarly
sources
mention
matthew
may
not
be
presenting
judas
death
as
you
claim
but
well
look
at
your
defense
of
this
later
also
the
reward
of
iniquity
in
the
acts
passage
may
not
be
the
pieces
of
silver
in
matthews
passages
although
you
have
a
valiant
attempt
later
at
stating
why
you
believe
it
is
at
this
beginning
stages
in
our
debates
we
are
laying
some
scriptural
groundwork
which
will
be
expanded
upon
through
deeper
exegesis
db
of
course
the
only
reason
i
can
see
to
so
drastically
reinterpret
a
passage
as
he
has
done
with
judas
death
is
to
make
it
agree
with
another
passage
so
that
both
could
be
considered
correct
my
reply
one
of
the
reasons
i
have
given
a
different
exegetical
view
of
the
passages
is
that
you
seem
to
think
the
majority
of
scholarship
is
wrong
in
concluding
these
passages
are
complimentary
however
i
see
no
problem
in
tony
roses
explanation
of
judas
death
how
would
you
explain
the
inaccuracy
between
judas
hanging
himself
in
matthew
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
this
question
of
the
manner
in
which
judas
died
is
one
with
which
we
are
constantly
confronted
in
our
travels
many
people
point
to
the
apparent
discrepancy
in
the
two
accounts
as
an
obvious
irreconcilable
error
some
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
idea
of
an
inerrant
bible
is
destroyed
by
these
contradictory
accounts
however
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
matthew
relates
that
judas
hanged
himself
while
peter
tells
us
he
fell
and
was
crushed
by
the
impact
the
two
statements
are
indeed
different
but
do
they
necessarily
contradict
each
other
matthew
does
not
say
that
judas
did
not
fall
neither
does
peter
say
that
judas
did
not
hang
himself
this
is
not
a
matter
of
one
person
calling
something
black
and
the
other
person
calling
it
white
both
accounts
can
be
true
and
supplementary
a
possible
reconstruction
would
be
this
judas
hanged
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
overlooked
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snapped
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
judas
fell
down
the
ledge
mangling
his
body
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
before
or
after
death
as
either
would
fit
this
explanation
this
possibility
is
entirely
natural
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examined
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocky
terraces
to
feet
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
are
not
told
how
long
judas
remained
hanging
from
the
tree
or
how
advanced
was
the
decomposition
of
his
body
before
his
fall
louis
gaussen
relates
a
story
of
a
man
who
was
determined
to
kill
himself
this
individual
placed
himself
on
the
sill
of
a
high
window
and
pointed
a
pistol
at
his
head
he
then
pulled
the
trigger
and
leaped
from
the
window
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
hand
a
person
could
say
that
this
man
took
his
life
by
shooting
himself
while
another
could
rightly
contend
he
committed
suicide
by
jumping
form
the
tall
building
in
this
case
both
are
true
as
both
are
true
in
the
case
of
matthews
and
peters
accounts
of
the
death
of
judas
it
is
merely
a
situation
of
different
perspectives
of
the
same
event
your
only
reason
for
rejecting
this
is
i
believe
your
attempt
to
discredit
inerrancy
you
havent
related
how
this
is
impossible
or
highly
unlikely
heres
what
you
said
in
an
earlier
post
db
quoting
tony
rose
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
are
not
told
how
long
judas
remained
hanging
from
the
tree
or
how
advanced
was
the
decomposition
of
his
body
before
his
fall
the
added
text
in
this
version
is
so
heavy
that
assuming
you
are
truly
so
opposed
to
such
tactics
you
should
find
it
not
credible
but
you
seem
to
find
tony
roses
eisegesis
satisfactory
while
clearly
rejecting
david
joslins
here
you
discredit
tonys
explanation
based
on
what
you
deem
too
heavy
for
the
passages
but
you
havent
addressed
why
you
feel
that
way
you
can
say
its
a
vain
attempt
to
reconcile
the
contradiction
but
that
doesnt
tell
me
it
didnt
happen
nor
have
you
shown
why
you
reject
that
possibility
questions
is
matthew
lying
or
is
luke
lying
or
are
they
both
lying
or
are
either
or
both
of
them
misinformed
why
do
you
think
there
is
such
an
alleged
contradiction
i
do
not
think
you
have
ever
told
us
what
you
believe
in
this
respect
db
at
present
though
mr
decenso
only
asks
two
questions
of
me
you
claim
acts
and
matthew
contradict
one
another
in
representing
judas
death
i
ask
you
again
to
provide
evidence
that
matthew
stated
judas
died
in
the
hanging
you
claim
that
the
pieces
of
silver
in
matthew
that
judas
threw
down
in
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
used
is
the
reward
of
iniquity
in
acts
that
pictures
judas
in
some
way
purchasing
a
field
with
therefore
there
is
a
contradiction
prove
that
the
pieces
of
silver
and
the
reward
of
iniquity
are
one
and
the
same
actually
i
find
question
to
be
a
rather
stupid
request
but
i
will
answer
it
because
he
now
restricts
himself
to
two
points
first
i
would
point
out
that
hanging
is
a
very
efficient
manner
for
ending
a
life
in
fact
it
is
a
bit
of
a
fluke
when
someone
survives
hanging
except
in
fantasy
cowboy
movies
and
even
then
it
usually
referred
to
as
an
attempted
hanging
my
reply
i
work
at
an
agency
that
investigates
child
abuse
and
neglect
today
i
got
a
call
re
a
child
that
attempted
suicide
by
hanging
himself
because
his
mother
is
on
crack
he
failed
in
his
attempt
and
is
in
a
childs
psych
ward
at
a
local
hospital
hanging
attempts
are
not
always
successful
to
assume
that
because
most
hangings
are
successful
this
one
was
also
is
begging
the
question
if
i
may
quote
you
last
night
listening
to
the
bible
answer
man
broadcast
the
christian
research
institutes
show
one
of
the
scholars
on
there
used
several
of
these
terms
that
you
use
i
am
not
all
that
familiar
with
them
the
man
on
the
bam
show
teaches
comparative
religion
and
logic
it
was
interesting
db
this
is
so
prevalent
that
so
that
to
say
a
man
hung
himself
with
no
other
qualifiers
is
synonymous
with
stating
that
he
killed
himself
my
reply
qualifiers
are
important
at
times
as
well
see
in
an
ot
passage
ill
mention
below
does
hanging
always
have
this
outcome
did
matthew
who
is
the
only
source
we
have
re
judas
hanging
himself
state
that
judas
died
as
a
result
to
say
its
synonymous
means
it
has
the
same
meaning
as
a
boy
age
hung
himself
but
he
lived
this
is
only
one
of
probably
thousands
of
documented
cases
we
can
discover
db
now
i
am
not
alone
in
this
thought
in
fact
since
mr
decenso
so
respects
christian
scholarly
including
greek
scholars
opinion
i
did
some
research
my
reply
thank
you
dave
db
interestingly
not
one
of
the
christian
references
i
read
interpreted
the
hanging
as
being
anything
but
a
fatal
suicide
my
reply
above
mine
so
its
ok
to
use
christian
sources
to
back
your
points
what
about
tonys
position
do
you
value
it
or
even
consider
it
as
a
valid
possibility
also
is
it
possible
that
the
sources
you
read
may
be
wrong
or
lying
or
deceived
in
other
parts
of
their
books
if
so
should
we
do
as
we
have
done
with
archer
toss
them
to
the
side
and
not
value
anything
they
say
including
their
interpretation
of
the
hanging
of
judas
i
am
sure
you
would
find
some
errors
and
maybe
even
some
deception
in
those
sources
you
also
noted
they
interpreted
the
hanging
as
meaning
he
died
although
that
is
very
possibly
true
do
you
find
that
in
the
text
itself
remember
thats
the
first
criteria
we
must
examine
db
this
included
the
biblical
knowledge
commentary
by
woodward
and
zuck
my
reply
which
i
own
its
a
good
source
of
commentary
info
but
not
inerrant
db
the
interpreters
on
volume

on
the

actually
i
could
have
presented
many
more
as
well
my
reply
i
appreciate
your
doing
this
research
dave
maybe
we
are
getting
somewhere
in
how
we
both
should
approach
these
alleged
contradictions
more
in
depth
study
db
in
each
case
these
references
specifically
describe
that
the
interpretation
of
matt
as
successful
suicide
and
thus
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
greek
word
apagchwie
hang
oneself
is
translated
as
a
successful
hanging
my
reply
above
mine
no
you
cant
only
conclude
this
although
as
tony
says
this
was
a
highly
probable
outcome
but
matthew
does
not
state
death
as
being
a
result
the
greek
word
is
apagcho
matthew
is
its
only
occurrence
in
the
new
testament
in
the
septuagint
the
greek
translation
of
the
ot
used
at
the
time
of
jesus
its
only
used
in
samuel
now
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
advice
was
not
followed
he
saddled
a
donkey
and
arose
and
went
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
then
he
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
he
was
buried
in
his
fathers
tomb
notice
that
not
only
is
it
stated
that
ahithophel
hanged
himself
gr
sept
apagcho
but
it
explicitly
adds
and
died
here
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
result
in
matthew
we
are
not
explicitly
told
judas
died
also
there
is
nothing
in
the
greek
to
suggest
success
or
failure
it
simply
means
hang
oneself
db
but
mr
decenso
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
disagree
and
show
more
reputable
christian
scholars
that
insist
that
the
hanging
was
not
successful
my
reply
above
mine
reputable
you
mean
ones
that
have
never
erred
as
far
as
insisting
that
the
hanging
was
unsuccessful
that
cant
be
done
even
by
me
as
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
although
i
still
agree
with
tonys
exegesis
as
being
the
most
probable
explanation
regarding
judas
death
taking
into
account
several
criteria
ive
recently
noticed
some
new
things
in
matthew
mat
then
he
threw
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
but
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
they
are
the
price
of
blood
and
they
consulted
together
and
bought
with
them
the
potters
field
to
bury
strangers
in
therefore
that
field
has
been
called
the
field
of
blood
to
this
day
first
of
all
notice
that
the
text
does
not
say
that
judas
died
as
a
result
of
hanging
all
it
says
is
that
he
went
and
hanged
himself
luke
however
in
acts
tells
us
that
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
this
is
a
pretty
clear
indication
along
with
the
other
details
given
in
acts
peters
speech
the
need
to
pick
a
new
apostle
etc
that
at
least
after
judas
fall
he
was
dead
so
the
whole
concept
that
matthew
and
luke
both
recount
judas
death
is
highly
probable
but
not
clear
cut
i
also
wrote
my
reply
here
we
have
a
stickler
dave
that
i
have
to
say
i
just
recently
noticed
lets
look
at
the
passage
in
matthew
mat
saying
i
have
sinned
by
betraying
innocent
blood
and
they
said
what
is
that
to
us
you
see
to
it
mat
then
he
threw
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
mat
but
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
they
are
the
price
of
blood
mat
and
they
consulted
together
and
bought
with
them
the
potters
field
to
bury
strangers
in
mat
therefore
that
field
has
been
called
the
field
of
blood
to
this
day
notice
verse
hewent
and
hanged
himself
matthew
does
not
say
judas
died
does
it
should
we
assume
he
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
what
does
acts
say
act
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
wages
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
act
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
dwelling
place
be
desolate
and
let
no
one
live
in
it
and
let
another
take
his
office
here
we
may
have
a
graphic
explanation
of
judas
deathso
my
line
of
reasoning
to
dispel
your
contradiction
myth
rethe
two
accounts
of
judas
death
is
thismatthew
doesnt
necessarily
explain
how
judas
died
he
does
say
judas
hanged
himself
but
he
didnt
specifically
say
judas
died
in
the
hanging
incident
however
acts
seems
to
show
us
his
graphic
demise
therefore
there
is
no
contradiction
between
matthew
and
acts
re
judas
death
my
reply
we
do
know
from
matthew
that
he
did
hang
himself
and
acts
probably
records
his
death
although
its
possible
and
plausible
that
he
fell
from
the
hanging
and
hit
some
rocks
thereby
bursting
open
i
can
no
longer
assume
that
to
be
the
case
therefore
no
contradiction
matthew
did
not
say
judas
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
did
he
most
scholars
believe
he
probably
did
but
i
quoted
all
that
to
show
that
i
highly
regard
the
scholars
explanations
but
in
looking
at
the
texts
initially
we
cant
assume
judas
died
it
is
however
highly
probable
db
by
the
way
while
all
agree
that
judas
died
from
the
hanging
the
books
had
different
ways
of
dealing
with
the
contradiction
we
are
discussing
one
simply
ignored
it
entirely
and
simply
referred
back
to
matthews
version
as
the
correct
version
in
both
matt
and
acts
the
biblical
knowledge
commentary
suggested
the
hypotheses
that
judas
hung
and
then
when
he
rotted
his
belly
exploded
which
doesnt
explain
his
headlong
fall
or
that
his
branch
or
rope
broke
and
he
fell
to
his
death
and
his
gut
gushed
out
which
doesnt
explain
how
a
hanging
man
would
fall
headlong
rather
than
feet
first
my
reply
the
outcome
of
any
fall
is
dependent
upon
many
factorshow
high
the
person
was
suspended
before
the
fall
any
obstructions
such
as
tree
branches
that
may
have
deviated
the
fall
how
steep
an
incline
of
rocky
surfaces
the
victim
fell
upon
thus
possibly
rolling
or
bouncing
of
several
rocks
etc
in
a
superficial
examination
of
the
acts
passage
and
the
matthew
passage
we
are
not
given
a
lot
of
info
on
the
geographical
specifics
but
tony
in
the
above
quoted
post
gave
us
some
a
possible
reconstruction
would
be
this
judas
hanged
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
overlooked
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snapped
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
judas
fell
down
the
ledge
mangling
his
body
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
before
or
after
death
as
either
would
fit
this
explanation
this
possibility
is
entirely
natural
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examined
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocky
terraces
to
feet
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
db
now
truthfully
i
do
not
see
what
is
comforting
about
matthew
confusing
the
source
of
the
potters
field
prophesy
but
on
the
other
hand
the
author
is
correct
matthew
does
make
that
confusion
of
course
a
biblical
inerrantist
who
claim
that
every
word
of
the
bible
is
guaranteed
true
by
god
will
have
to
thereby
add
one
more
contradiction
to
the
death
of
judas
ie
where
the
prophesy
of
the
potters
field
came
from
my
reply
please
when
we
are
done
with
this
study
on
his
death
remind
me
to
discuss
this
with
you
db
as
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
judas
purchased
the
land
was
indeed
for
the
betrayal
rather
than
some
other
source
i
would
point
out
that
in
acts
where
it
specifically
mention
the
reward
of
iniquity
acts
it
also
specifically
mentions
what
act
of
iniquity
they
were
talking
about
ie
acts
concerning
judas
who
was
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bible
describes
an
act
of
iniquity
and
then
immediately
discusses
the
reward
of
iniquity
it
would
be
rather
inane
to
suggest
that
it
was
an
action
of
iniquity
other
than
the
one
discussed
my
reply
dave
we
are
getting
somewhere
arent
we
act
and
in
those
days
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
disciples
altogether
the
number
of
names
was
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
said
act
men
and
brethren
this
scripture
had
to
be
fulfilled
which
the
holy
spirit
spoke
before
by
the
mouth
of
david
concerning
judas
who
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
act
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
act
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
wages
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
act
and
it
became
known
to
all
those
dwelling
in
jerusalem
so
that
field
is
called
in
their
own
language
akel
dama
that
is
field
of
blood
act
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
dwelling
place
be
desolate
and
let
no
one
live
in
it
and
let
another
take
his
office
notice
that
in
verse
the
word
iniquity
is
not
used
rather
it
states
that
judas
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therevs
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
what
part
did
judas
play
in
their
ministry
joh
this
he
said
not
that
he
cared
for
the
poor
but
because
he
was
a
thief
and
had
the
money
box
and
he
used
to
take
what
was
put
in
it
joh
for
some
thought
because
judas
had
the
money
box
that
jesus
had
said
to
him
buy
those
things
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
so
now
we
know
what
part
judas
played
he
was
a
treasurer
per
se
right
after
peter
stated
that
judas
played
a
part
in
this
ministry
treasurer
according
to
john
then
luke
adds
the
parenthetical
explanation
of
wages
of
iniquity
money
that
should
have
been
put
into
the
ministry
but
was
stolen
by
judas
to
purchase
a
field
i
believe
this
is
a
better
exegetical
explanation
of
what
the
wages
of
iniquity
are
what
do
you
think
dave
db
now
since
i
have
given
you
clear
answers
and
even
references
perhaps
you
could
unequivocally
state
what
type
of
inerrantist
you
are
instead
of
asking
me
what
type
i
think
you
are
as
you
did
to
mr
joslin
my
reply
i
will
gladly
admit
that
i
am
a
complete
inerrantist
although
i
do
not
have
that
big
a
problem
with
the
limited
inerrancy
view
frank
if
one
wished
to
contend
with
him
he
could
not
answer
him

about

by
the

mr
decenso
you
really
should
have
looked
in
the
index
of
your
bauerarndtgingrich
greek
lexicon
you
would
have
found
that
the
word
in
acts
for
lot
is
kleros
not
chorion
as
stated
by
mr
archer
and
nowhere
in
the
very
large
discussion
of
kleros
in
done
the
to
theological
dictionary
of
the
new
testament
by
bromley
is
the
meaning
burial
plot
discussed
it
discusses
the
forms
of
kleros
eg
kleros
kleroo
etc
and
the
various
meanings
of
kleros
eg
plot
of
land
and
inheritance
but
mentions
nothing
about
chorion
or
burial
plot
why
does
this
not
surprise
me
thus
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
good
thing
you
dumped
archer
as
a
reference
i
was
wrong
i
admit
that
i
do
not
have
a
handle
on
greek
grammar
and
thus
confused
kleros
the
second
to
last
word
in
acts
as
being
the
plot
of
land
discussed
in
actuality
it
is
chorion
which
is
the
last
word
acts
unfortunately
my
greek
dictionary
does
not
discuss
chorion
so
i
cannot
report
as
to
the
nuances
of
the
word
i
abhor
publishing
trash
i
abhor
it
of
myself
even
more
than
i
do

since
i

not
present
myself
as
an
authority
on
the
subject
i
do
not
feel
dishonest
though
i
do
openly
admit
ignorance
and
incompetence
in
this
example
thus
i
felt
honor
bound
to
do
a
better
set
of
research
specifically
on
the
word
first
it
should
be
noted
that
greek
grammar
is
not
as
tough
as
i
first
assumed
it
is
not
nontrivial
by
any
means
and
i
still
am
not
competent
with
it
but
it
is
not
as
opaque
as
i
had
thought
it
turns
out
that
while
the
index
for
the
bauerarndtgingrich
greek
lexicon
renders
each
verse
in
order
each
word
within
a
verse
is
put
in
greek
alphabetical
order
thus
while
the
the
meaning
of
the
verse
is
decipherable
the
syntax
is
far
from
clear
on
the
other
hand
a
greekenglish
intralinear
bible
makes
things
a
lot
more
comprehendable
and
yes
the
word
for
field
in
acts
is
indeed
chorion
now
ive
checked
several
greekenglish
lexicons
greek
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
louw
and
nida
robinsons
greek
and
english
lexicon

greek
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
and
other
early
christian
writings
bauerarndtgingrich
the
new
analytical
greek
lexicon
perschbacher
in
each
case
the
meaning
of
the
word
chorion
was
given
variously
as
a
space
place
region
district
field
area
country
place
land
farm
estate
a
bit
of
tillage
and
similar
meanings
nowhere
do
any
of
these
books
mention
anything
about
grave
as
some
of
these
books
go
into
great
detail
i
would
be
very
surprised
to
find
that
these
books
are
all
inadequate
and
mr
archer
is
the
only
competent
scholar
in
greek
i
think
it
more
likely
that
mr
archers
investigations
into
contradictions
to
be
once
again
as
your
friend
said
it
lacking
in
substance
and
thus
archer
is
again
shown
worthless
as
an
expert
witness
by
the
way
mr
decenso
i
would
have
honorably
presented
my
results
on
this
matter
even
if
i
had
found
them
to
support
mr
archers
contentions
by
the
way
among
these
lexicons
eg
robinsons
is
the
definition
of
agros
the
word
used
in
matthew
to
describe
the
field
bought
the
word
agros
is
defined
as
a
field
in
the
country
chorion
is
specifically
noted
as
a
synonym
to
agros
this
is
significant
as
it
is
evidence
of
how
silly
bullingers
exegisis
was
which
stated
that
the
word
for
field
in
matthew
ie
agros
is
different
from
the
word
for
field
in
acts
ie
chorion
and
thus
we
must
be
talking
about
two
different
fields
of
course
you
already
admit
how
stupid
bullingers
exegisis
is
but
this
was
a
small
serendipity
which
drives
the
point
home
so
as
of
now
unless
mr
decenso
show
compelling
reasons
to
believe
otherwise
eg
a
reputable
scholar
with
reputable
references
i
consider
this
particular
issue
closed
see
mr
decenso
now
you
can
go
on
to
answer
questions
about
the
denials
of
peter
the
day
of
the
crucifixion
tyre
and
the
fact
that
the
author
of
matthew
quoted
from
the
wrong
prophet
in
discussing
the
potters
field
later
dave
butler
precise
knowledge
is
the
only
true
knowledge
and
he
who
does
not
teach
exactly
does
not
teach
at
all
henry
ward
beecher
american
clergyman
as
recorded
by
george
seldes
subject
re
new
biblical
contradictions
still
not
answered
judas
mr
decenso
in
spite
of
requiring
scholarly
opinion
on
the
hanging
of
judas
rejects
that
the
scholarly
opinion
of
the
those
scholars
and
then
rephrases
those
scholars
opinion
on
the
subject
we
do
know
from
matthew
that
he
did
hang
himself
and
acts
probably
records
his
death
although
its
possible
and
plausible
that
he
fell
from
the
hanging
and
hit
some
rocks
thereby
bursting
open
i
can
no
longer
assume
that
to
be
the
case
therefore
no
contradiction
matthew
did
not
say
judas
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
did
he
most
scholars
believe
he
iprobably
did
but
i
quoted
all
that
to
show
that
i
highly
regard
the
scholars
explanations
but
in
looking
at
the
texts
initially
we
cant
assume
judas
died
it
is
however
highly
probable
and
also
there
is
nothing
in
the
greek
to
suggest
success
or
failure
it
simply
means
hang
oneself
actually
if
you
do
further
research
as
to
the
greek
word
apacgw
you
will
find
that
it
does
denote
success
those
scholars
did
indeed
have
an
excellent
reason
to
assume
that
the
suicide
was
successful
as
i
pointed
out
i
recently
checked
several
lexicons
greek
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
louw
and
nida
robinsons
greek
and
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament

bauerarndtgingrich
the

lexicon
perschbacher
a
couple
simply
stated
hanged
oneself
and
a
couple
were
more
explicit
and
stated
that
apacgw
means
specifically
kill
yourself
by
hanging
a
couple
also
noted
that
the
meaning
of
one
the
root
words
for
apacgw
is
strangle
throttle
or
choke
which
pretty
much
invalidates
the
guy
who
suggested
to
david
joslin
that
judas
was
hung
upside
down
one
of
the
best
references
though
robinsons
greek
and
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
not
only
stated
the
translation
it
gave
both
the
root
words
the
literal
translation
related
greek
words
which
use
the
same
roots
and
also
other
presented
specific
examples
of
the
word
in
greek
literature
to
give
further
context
the
word
apagchw
has
two
root
words
gchw
is
the
to
strangle
root
and
the
root
word
apo
means
literally
away
this
root
words
is
included
in
words
which
denote
a
transition
it
can
mean
a
transition
in
place
eg
the
greek
word
apagello
means
to
send
a
message
apo
can
also
denote
a
change
in
state
and
specifically
the
change
from
life
to
death
robinson
specifically
makes
comparison
to
the
word
apokteiuo
which
means
to
kill
in
literal
meaning
the
word
apacgw
means
to
throttle
strangle
to
put
out
of
the
way
and
implicitly
denotes
a
change
in
life
state
ie
away
from
life
to
death
so
while
the
word
apacgw
does
mean
to
hang
it
specifically
denotes
a
death
as
well
thus
robinson
is
quite
specific
when
he
state
that
it
means
to
hang
oneself
to
end
ones
life
by
hanging
he
then
notes
the
the
use
of
apacgw
in
homers
odessy
to
denote
context
he
presents
that
example
of
apacgw
as
being
used
to
explicitly
mean
suicide
by
hanging
now
since
there
is
a
perfectly
good
word
for
strangling
without
the
added
denotation
of
death
and
as
you
insist
that
the
bible
was
written
by
god
and
every
word
is
precicely
correct
you
are
stuck
with
the
complete
meaning
of
apacgw
ie
since
the
word
apacgw
was
used
then
death
is
denoted
as
the
result
by
the
way
i
note
that
mr
decenso
also
presents
an
example
of
apacgw
in
the
septuagint
the
greek
translation
of
the
ot
used
at
the
time
of
jesus
its
only
used
in
samuel
now
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
advice
was
not
followed
he
saddled
a
donkey
and
arose
and
went
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
then
he
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
he
was
buried
in
his
fathers
tomb
notice
that
not
only
is
it
stated
that
ahithophel
hanged
himself
gr
sept
apagcho
but
it
explicitly
adds
and
died
here
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
result
in
matthew
we
are
not
explicitly
told
judas
died
note
mr
decenso
as
you
say
the
septuagint
was
a
translation
from
hebrew
to
greek
and
you
have
not
shown
the
original
meaning
of
the
hebrew
ie
the
the
hebrew
say
and
died
and
thus
whether
it
was
simply
echoed
in
the
greek
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
regardless
of
the
added
and
died
the
correct
translation
would
still
be
apacgw
as
the
man
did
indeed
die
from
strangulation
redundant
but
correct
further
we
have
evidence
that
the
septuagint
was
repeatedly
rewritten
and
reedited
which
included
versions
which
contradicted
each
other
and
such
editing
was
not
even
necessarily
executed
by
greeks
thus
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
use
the
septuagint
as
it
now
stands
as
a
paragon
of
ancient
greek
so
what
you
really
need
to
prove
your
point
mr
decenso
is
an
example
in
ancient
greek
of
someone
committing
apacgw
and
surviving
otherwise
i
would
see
you
as
simply
making
worthless
assertions
without
corresponding
evidence
now
i
would
note
mr
decenso
that
everytime
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
research
it
one
of
your
apparently
contrived
exegisis
i
pretty
much
find
it
false
thus
i
think
that
if
you
are
going
to
add
to
the
text
something
over
and
above
what
the
source
clearly
says
then
you
had
better
have
an
explicit
greek
or
historical
source
to
justify
it
by
the
way
as
to
mr
roses
statement
about
trees
around
the
potters
field
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
unless
mr
rose
can
show
that
these
trees
are
two
thousand
years
old
or
that
there
are
year
old
stumps
there
or
has
a
thousand
year
old
description
of
the
area
which
mentions
such
trees
then
it
is
inappropriate
for
him
to
assert
that
the
present
placement
of
trees
prove
the
location
of
the
trees
two
thousand
years
ago
after
all
things
change
now
as
to
your
other
argument
ie
that
the
money
judas
used
is
not
the
same
as
the
silvers
as
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
judas
purchased
the
land
was
indeed
for
the
betrayal
rather
than
some
other
source
i
would
point
out
that
in
acts
where
it
specifically
mention
the
reward
of
iniquity
acts
it
also
specifically
mentions
what
act
of
iniquity
they
were
talking
about
ie
acts
concerning
judas
who
was
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bible
describes
an
act
of
iniquity
and
then
immediately
discusses
the
reward
of
iniquity
it
would
be
rather
inane
to
suggest
that
it
was
an
action
of
iniquity
other
than
the
one
discussed
notice
that
in
verse
the
word
iniquity
is
not
used
rather
it
states
that
judas
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therevs
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
what
part
did
judas
play
in
their
ministry
true
peter
or
the
author
of
acts
does
not
specifically
call
judas
betrayal
an
iniquity
but
for
that
matter
neither
does
john
specifically
call
judas
actions
an
iniquity
either
further
john
did
not
say
that
judas
took
the
money
box
but
rather
said
some
thought
that
because
judas
had
the
money
box
jesus
was
telling
him
buy
what
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
so
after
receiving
the
morsel
he
immediately
went
out
and
it
was
night
note
that
it
is
said
that
judas
left
it
does
not
say
that
he
took
the
money
box
thus
when
i
see
your
explanation
it
still
seems
to
me
you
would
choose
the
a
an
unproven
iniquity
mentioned
by
another
author
in
a
different
book
written
at
a
different
time
over
the
iniquity
explicitly
mentioned
by
the
author
of
acts
i
find
this
forced
and
contrived
of
course
this
particular
argument
becomes
moot
since
we
have
have
seen
evidence
that
apacgw
means
suicide
you
see
since
judas
hanging
was
successful
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
mentioned
in
john
because
matthew
and
mark
explicitly
say
the
betrayal
was
on
the
high
holy
day
ie
passover
and
thus
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
before
killing
himself
the
next
day
thus
the
money
which
bought
the
field
of
blood
would
have
to
have
been
the
pieces
of
silver
of
course
he
got
the
pieces
of
silver
that
night
as
well
and
thus
couldnt
have
spent
that
either
oh
dear
i
believe
that
the
house
of
cards
is
comming
down
maybe
we
should
at
this
point
discuss
now
whether
jesus
was
crucified
on
friday
or
saturday
as
that
is
now
part
of
the
argument
about
judas
by
the
way
as
to
where
the
prophesy
of
the
potters
field
came
from
ie
the
mention
of
it
in
matthew
you
say
please
when
we
are
done
with
this
study
on
his
death
remind
me
to
discuss
this
with
you
i
am
reminding
you
now
to
discuss
it
now
its
all
part
of
the
same
verse
we
are
discussing
and
i
wish
you
would
quit
procrastinating
and
sidestepping
these
issues

but
the
child
is
free
to
grow
up

live
a

and
normal
life
when
the
woman
abandons
the
child
is
diced
or
killed
with

the

has
no

and
the

sometimes
suffers
so
badly
that
he
wishes
he
could
trade
places
with
his

ths
root
of
this
whole
problem
is
selfishnessthe
arrogance
that
says
my
feelings
and
desires
are
supreme
and
your
well
being
is
not
worth
dung
and
when
you
come
down
to
it
this
is
the
substance
of
what
hell
is
made
of
its
the
reason
a
loving
god
can
throw
selfish
people
to
the
devil
and
his
demons
for
all
of
eternity
let
any
one
of
us
unrepentant
into
heaven
and
well
ruin
it
the
first
chance
we
get
now
i
dont
really
know
the
answer
to
these
questions
but
ive
got
a
real
good
guess
and
its
probably
right
and
i
wouldnt
call
that
benevolent
either
it
is
a
move
in
the
right
direction
as
it
is
now
we
dont
see
our
responsibility
because
we
kill
it
and
get
it
out
of
sight
the
media
backs
us
completely
real
responsibility
does
not
sell
the
only
responsibility
that
sells
in
the
marketplace
is
that
which
is
just
enough
to
make
us
feel
responsible
without
showing
anything
that
might
show
us
our
own
true
irresponsibility
we
want
to
feel
like
good
people
but
we
want
nothing
with
being
good
people
just
give
me
the
freedom
to
say
im
good
and
the
rest
of
the
world
can
burn
rape
and
kill
my
children
and
throw
my
parents
to
the
places
where
poor
old
folks
rot
until
theyre
dead
ill
hate
my
brother
and
sister
if
i
wish
and
ill
cheat
on
my
wife
or
husband
screw
the
government
because
it
screws
me
and
dont
talk
to
me
about
giving
to
the
church
because
church
people
are
all
a
bunch
of
money
grubbing
hypocrites
but
im
a
good
person
at
least
i
admit
what
i
do
at
least
i
love
myself
and
we
all
know
that
is
the
greatest
love
in
the
worldnot
that
a
man
lay
down
his
life
for
his
brotherthat
sounds
too
christian
at
the
root
this
is
the
substance
of
what
hell

of
weve
become
a

society
no
longer
responsible
to
our

to
our

they

this

what

cry
from

looking
at
we
find
that
during
roman
times
tyre
vied
with
sidon
for
first
place
in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
period
that
tyre
was
the
seat
of
a
christian
bishop
eventually
with
dioceses
under
it
that
the
most
magnificent
church
of
its
kind
in
all
phoenecia
was
the
basilica
built
in
tyre
ca
that
tyre
was
well
known
for
its
exports
of
glassware
wine
white
marble
and
dyed
cloth
that
tyre
along
with
other
seaports
provided
outlets
for
south
arabian
indian
and
even
chinese
trade
that
tyre
had
to
accomodate
its
growing
population
by
following
a
perpendicular
rather
than
horizontal
line
of
growth
because
it
was
running
out
of
land
to
build
on
that
tyre
established
colonies
of
its
own
none
of
this
sounds
like
a
small
fishing
village
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
centuries
later
under
the
abbasids
tyre
had
opulent
and
flourishing
bazaars
and
buildings
of
stories
during
this
period
tyre
was
noted
for
its
export
of
sugar
beads
and
as
of
old
glassware
during
the
crusades
tyre
was
the
secondmost
flourishing

there
is
a

more

and

and

it
notes
that
after

appeared

revival
of

economy
if
tyre
is
such
an
insignificant
little
fishing
village
at

why
is
it
always
called
a
city
or
above
a
major
city
why
does
it
show
up
on
all
the
maps
when
population
figures
for
cities
in

are
given

is

to
lets
assume
the

one
is
correct
by
modern

we
are
talking
about

they
may
even
use

most

give

one

gives
the

of

as
the

give
comparatively
high
figures
for
sidon
and
beirut
also
so
i
doubt
that
it
is
a
typo
perhaps
these
were
figures
for
the
cities
and
their
surrounding
areas
i
dont
doubt
that
the
population
of
tyre
has
fluctuated
over
the
last
few
decades
in
particular
the
israeli
military
action
hurt
tyre
quite
a
bit
after
alex
the
g
it
fell
once
more
in
the

believe
what
other
times
did
it
fall
that
you
were
thinking
of
to
egypt
bce
to
the
seleucids
bce
rome
bce
after
rome
it
fell
to
various
arab
contingents
until
ce
when
it
was
captured
in
the
crusades
it
was
then
recaptured
again
by
the
muslims
in
ce
and
subsequently
pillaged
then
the
french
turks
british
and
today
lebanon
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
times
that
tyre
was
destroyed
dont
most
if
not
all
of
these
apply
not
just
to
tyre
but
to
the
other
cities
in
the
area
sidon
for
example
can
you
make
a
case
for
tyre
having
been
singled
out
well
it
recovered
enough
to
have
a
thriving
commerce
in
the
dye
tyrian
purple
in
roman
times
this
is
correct
but
they
were
under
roman
domination
and
the
majority
of
the
created
wealth
was
siphoned
off
the
prophesy
hold
true
they
had
a
good
deal
of
autonomy
under
the
seleucids
from
tyre
received
the
rights
of
autonomy
from
antiochus
ephiphanes
and
from
bc
onward
enjoyed
complete
autonomy
she
started
a
large
series
of
coins
occasionally
in
gold
the
descriptions
of
tyre
under
the
romans
dont
seem
to
fit
your
characterization
either
and
under
the
abbasids
it
seems
to
have
been
allowed
to
flourish
i
still
think
you
are
stretching

you
try
to
describe
tyre
as
having
been
nothing
but
a

village

blatant
persecution

people
i

called

along

not

actually
shown

use

one

familiar

widely
it
was
actively
distributed
and
how
many
naive
people
are
actually
believing
the
garbage
found
within
it
the
truth
is
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
fully
speak
for
anyone
who
calls
themself
gay
but
knowing
as
many
as
i
do
and
knowing
their
testimonies
and
witnessing
thier
faith
and
life
i
have
to
say
that
the
report
you
posted
is
a
very
biased
report
something
obviously
claimed
against
gays
as
well
the
truth
is
that
unless
you
are
innately
gay
you
cannot
know
what
harm
you
are
causing
i
speak
as
an
abolitionist
who
supports
affirming
gay
rights
in
our
society
i
do
not
support
wild
sex
or
any
other
misrepresentations
perpetrated
by
christian
fundamentalist
extremists
but
i
know
people
who
are
not
the
sexual
deviants
your
report
paints
them
to
be
it
is
no
mistake
that
the
apa
removed
homosexuality
from
its
list
of
mental
illnesses
it
is
also
no
mistake
that
there
are
many
christians
and
homophobes
who
long
to
bring
it
back
to
the
list
i
do
not
feel

are
men
anybody
who
is
involved
in
the
exgay
ministry
is
misguided
and
is
wasting
their
time
says
lisa
seeley
a
former
redeemed
lesbian
who
worked
with
caligiuri
as
ha
and
appeared
with
him
on
the
sally
jessy
raphael
show
these
organizations
are
for
people
who
are
spiritually
and
emotionally
wounded
its
possible
to
change
your
identity
or
your
behavior
says
sex
educator
brian
mcnaught
author
of
on
being
gay
but
its
really
impossible
to
change
your
orientation
these
people
are
no
longer
calling
themselves
gay
but
they
continue
to
have
samesex
erotic
feelings
caligiuri
says
he
founded
free
indeed
after
an
ominous
week
in
when
all
hell
broke
loose
in
his
personal
life
a
few
days
after
his
lover
ended
both
their
romance
and
their
business
partnership
caligiuri
was
sexually
assaulted
by
a
man
he
picked
up
in
a
bar
i
was
really
drunk
he
recalls
and
i
went
home
with
this
guy
he
tied
me
up
and
raped
me
he
left
me
tied
up
all
night
and
the
next
morning
he
raped
me
again
when
caligiuri
was
eventually
freed
by
the
attacker
he
returned
home
to
the
home
he
shared
with
his
exlover
he
had
another
man
there
with
him
caligiuri
recalls
i
thought
at
this
time
if
this
is
what
being
gay
is
about
i
dont
want
to
be
this
way
anymore
caligiuri
vowed
that
if
he
could
find
a
way
out
he
would
share
his
discovery
with
others
he
organized
an
antigay
contingent
to
demonstrate
at
phoenixs
gay
pride
parade
in
june
and
a
few
months
later
free
indeed
held
its
first
public
protest
at
a
meeting
to
promote
a
gay
civil
rights
ordinance
free
indeed
members
loudly
blasted
gays
telling
them
ther
were
sinners
headed
for
hell
free
indeed
began
receiving
about
a
hundred
telephone
calls
a
week
thanks
in
part
to
a
deceptive
listing
in
the
local
yellow
pages
we
were
listed
under
lesbian
and
gay
alternative
services
caligiuri
says
so
people
thought
we
were
a
gay
information
switchboard
people
would
call
to
find
out
where
the
local
bars
were
and
wed
preach
to
them
about
the
sins
of
homo
sexuality
ruses
like
this
are
typical
of
the
movement
caligiuri
says
adding
theyll
do
anything
to
reach
these
people
david
used
to
go
on
radio
and
say
really
stupid
things
recalls
peter
kelly
a
counselor
at
phoenixs
catholic
diocese
aids
program
like
that
he
knew
he
was
gay
when
he
started
wearing
pastel
colors
caligiuris
family
first
found
out
about
his
ministry
when
they
saw
him
on
raphaels
syndicated
talk
show
in
they
were
relieved
he
recalls
they
figured
that
if
they
had
to
have
a
gay
person
in
the
family
better
that
i
should
be
a
reformed
gay
person
but
caligiuri
was
hardly
reformed
by
the
time
i
appeared
on
sallys
show
id
started
having
sex
with
men
again
men
would
call
our
hotline
and
tell
me
about
thier
latest
sin
sex
with
their
pastor
sex
with
their
father
i
was
horny
all
the
time
unable
to
risk
going
to
gay
bars
where
he
might
be
recognized
from
his
numerous
television
appearances
caligiuri
says
he
used
to
go
to
bookstores
and
get
blowjobs
when
he
wasnt
working
the
bookstores
he
was
sleeping
with
other
reformed
homosexuals
i
didnt
realize
it
at
first
but
a
lot
of
the
ha
leaders
were
having
sex
with
one
another
caligiuri
says
wed
go
to
conferences
in
other
cities
and
wed
be
paired
up
in
hotel
rooms
everybody
was
sleeping
with
everybody
else
by
the
time
he
appeared
on
am
philadelphia
television
show
in
may
caligiuri
was
having
anonymous
sex
a
couple
times
a
week
when
the
shows
host
asked
him
if
he
ever
acted
on
temptation
his
answer
was
a
lie
caligiuris
duplicity
began
to
take
its
toll
on
him
however
he
was
suffering
from
chrinic
fatigue
syndrome
and
candidiasis
a
dibilitating
yeast
infection
and
this
led
to
his
escape
from
the
sect
i
was
too
sick
to
go
to
church
he
explains
the
more
time
i
spent
away
from
those
people
the
more
i
began
to
feel
like
myself
i
began
to
remember
who
i
used
to
be
late
in
caligiuri
turned
free
indeed
phone
lines
over
to
a
local
church
and
closed
the
ministrys
doors
id
convinced
myself
that
there
is
no
need
in
the
world
for
exgay
people
he
says
today
caligiuri
is
studying
alternative
spiritualities
im
interest
ed
in
belief
systems
that
arent
judgemental
considering
romance
but
not
with
a
christian
and
searching
for
a
new
project
to
devote
himself
to
i
feel
compelled
to
commit
myself
to
gay
causes
he
says
i
want
to
eventually
stop
feeling
guilty
about
what
i
did
and
make
up
for
the
damage
i
may
have
brought
to
our
community
end
article
caligiuris
tory
is
by
no
means
unique
and
i
have
read
several
other
articles
of
former
leaders
and
founders
of
exgay
ministries
who
have
said
very
similar
th
similar
things
fortuantely
not
all
of
them
have
left
christianity
but
have
come
to
realize
that
god
loves
them
despite
the
attitudes
of
others
some
like
chris
glaser
director
of
the
presbyterian
lazarus
project
of
west
hollywood
presbyterian
church
have
actually
been
working
with
the
gay
community
to
bring
them
into
the
sheepfold
of
christ
and
encouraging
real
ethical
values
of
sexuality
within
the
sphere
of
being
gay
i
have
also
as
i
said
talked
and
become
and
become
close
friends
with
many
who
once
attended
such
groups
as
love
in
action
and
others
who
either
once
claimed
to
have
been
reformed
or
who
were
too
honest
with
themselves
to
live
a
lie
no
matter
who
was
disappointed
in
them
some
were
even
encouraged
to
marry
as
a
way
of
sealing
their
new
heterosexuality
only
to
eventually
start
hitting
the
bars
bathhouses
and
bookstores
since
these
were
usually
activities
under
the
concealment
of
night
and
onenightstands
of
promiscuous
behavior
meant
no
continuous
sin
through
a
committed
relationship
this
is
a
horrible
trap
which
the
church
has
dumped
on
the
backs
of
the
truly
gay
oriented
people
and
the
very
inno
cent
victims
in
these
cases
are
the
wives
and
children
of
such
marriages
yet
the
church
insists
that
there
are
only
two
options
they
are
willing
to
allow
gay
people
heterosexuality
or
celebacy
this
is
sad
what
is
also
mrtifying
is
in
the
cases
of
those
who
cannot
suppress
their
desires
and
fear
for
thier
sanity
in
such
a
mixed
up
confusion
that
the
church
forces
on
them
they
may
even
opt
for
suicide
or
surgical
dampering
of
the
brain
functions
in
the
past
lobotomies
and
heavey
drug
suppressants
were
common
place
there
are
now
becoming
available
more
and
more
literature
on
the
threat
of
coercive
christianity
toward
gays
such
as
sylvia
penningtons
exgays
there
are
none
and
others
there
are
also
a
great
many
fact
based
books
being
written
to
help
people
trapped
in
this
confusion
such
as
maury
johnstons
gays
under
grace
and
chris
glasers
come
hom
i
seriously
recommend
those
for
people
seeking
help
for
this
persecution
and
selfacceptance

for

the

big
on

it

that

i
know
about
sanctification
ive
been
taught
all
about
it
in
sunday
school
catechism
class
and
theology
classes
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
maybe
im
still
not
understanding

or
maybe
im
just
understanding
it
all
too
well
from
the
bottom

i
know
that
the
punishment

is
wrong
ive
tried
repeatedly
over

i
just
cant
if
this

that
i
cant

a

i

ill
wait

tomorrow
if
you

the

i

why
do

so
het
up
about
the
idea
that
relativism

better
than
objectivism
to
the
degree
that
relativism
is
a
more
accurate
decription
of
the
truth
than
is
objectivism
it
provides
more
power
and
ability
to
control
events
assuming
for
the
moment
that
morals
are
relative
then
two
relativists
can
recognize
that
neither
has
a
lock
on
the
absolute
truth
and
they
can
proceed
to
negotiate
a
workable
compromise
that
produces
the
desired
results
assuming
that
there
is
an
absolute
morality
two
disagreeing
objectivists
can
either
be
both
wrong
or
just
one
of
them
right
there
is
no
room
for
compromise
once
you
beleive
in
absolute
morals
you
must
accept
that
you
are
amoral
or
that
everyone
who
disagrees
with
you
is
amoral

choice

ineffective
recently
the
founders
of

another
prominent
exgay

international
denounced
their

therapy
procedures
as
ineffective
michael
busse

gary
cooper
cofounders
of

international
and
lovers
for
years
were
involved
with
the
organization
from
to
the
program
was
described
by
these
men
as
ineffective
not
one
person
was
healed
they
stated
that
the
program
often
exacerbated
already
prominent
feelings
of
guilt
and
personal
failure
among
the
counselees
many
were
driven
to
suicidal
thoughts
as
a
result
of
the
failed
reparative
therapy
the
previous
article
quoted
in
the
last
posting
is
from
the
advocate
june
called
the
exexgay
by
robert
pela
some
personal
thoughts
it
is
of
no
great
astonishment
that
there
is
a
concerted
effort
by
a
major
portion
of
the
church
to
control
and
mandate
change
of
a
minority
among
its
ranks
this
was
the
momentum
behind
the
spanish
inquisition
only
all
they
required
was
a
confession
of
faith
after
much
torture
and
then
to
save
their
souls
they
would
dispatch
them
to
heaven
through
death
even
later
the
bible
was
used
vigorously
to
defend
slavery
oppression
and
segragation
of
africanamericans
even
to
the
justification
of
lynchings
todays
scholars
are
just
a
bit
more
slick
in
their
approach
the
tool
is
still
coersion
but
now
it
is
mostly
by
means
of
brainwashing
and
mind
control
convincing
people
that
they
should
see
themselves
as
less
than
god
sees
them
then
maintaining
a
cultic
hold
on
them
until
it
is
felt
thier
mindconditioning
is
complete
sure
no
one
is
physically
forced
to
stay
in
this
reparative
therapy
but
sheer
social
pressure
is
enough
for
many
to
keep
themselves
in
this
new
found
bondage
of
selfhate
as
an
abolitionist
i
advocate
the
abolishment
of
oppression
and
persecution
against
gays
in
all
facets
of
civil
life
a
person
should
be
judged
by
the
contibution
or
noncontribution

they

in

anyway
i
counted

during

i
also
found
out
the
possible
reason
why
the
numbers

the
inhabitants
of

is
defined

and
it
seems
that
tyre
is
one
of
the
places
where
people
from
libanon
flee
to
during
more
extensive
bombings
so
theres
a
constant
flow
of
refugees
entering

leaving
tyre
articles
mentioned
thousands
of
people
entering

leaving
this
place
i
counted

from
now
i
will

moral
driver
distinctions
deleted
in
this
case
the
driver
does
not
evolve
but
simply
is
there
would
probably
not
be
any
manifestation
in
an
infant
because
the
moral
code
has
not
been
learnt
yet
ie
the
object
upon
which
the
driver
acts
upon
without
manifestation
though
how
can
the
driver
be
detected
for
all
purposes
it
seems
not
to
exist
until
moral
coding
begins
actually
i
agree
with
your
notion
of
a
driver
except
that
i
think
its
not
moral
but
pre
and
supermoral
it
is
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
this
thread
a
primal
sense
of
connection
a
pre
and
postnatal
umbilical
the
awareness
of
which
is
expressed
in
a
partial
fragmented
way
that
accomodates
and
forms
in
return
the
language
and
customs
of
a
given
culture
this
halting
pidginenglish
expression
is
i
think
what
we
come
to
call
morality
compare
the
driver
to
an
urge
such
as
jealousy
where
there
is
an
urge
and
an
object
the
jealousy
does
not
technically
exist
until
the
object
is
apparent
however
the
capacity
to
be
jealous
is
presumably
still
there
even
though
it
is
not
detectable
your
description
of
the
unbilical
took
me
three
passes
to
understand
but
i
get
the
gist
and
i
have
to
tentatively
agree
i
think
our
two
definitions
can
sit
side
by
side
without
too
much
trouble
though
i
havent
attempted
to
define
the
reason
behind
the
moral
driver
only
hinted
through
the
essence
of
each
moral
your
definition
hints
that
animals
are
also
capable
of
a
similar
morality
simians
have
a
similar
social
order
to
ourselves
and
it
is
easy
to
anthropomorphize
with
these
animals
is
this
possible
or
have
i
misunderstood
if
my
suggestion
holds
true
then
this
is
the
area
where
work
must
be
carried
out
to
prevent
a
moral
deterioration
of
society
what
kind
of
work
exactly
well
here
you
have
asked
the
big
question
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
that
you
were
hoping
i
would
say
something
really
contentious
in
this
reply
from
your
final
question
no
not
at
all
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
subscribed
to
some
particular
school
of
psychosocial
thought
and
rehabilitation
and
if
perhaps
you
had
a
plan
id
have
been
interested
to
hear
it
my
ps
thoughts
falls
roughly
in
line
with
john
stuart
mill
and
his
writings
on
utilitarianism
i
have
no
particular
plan
except
to
do
my
bit
personal
ethics
and
social
work
my
opinion
for
what
it
is
worth
is
that
the
authority
for
each
moral
must
be
increased
somehow
and
that
this
will
probably
take
several
generations
to
be
effective
i
dont
think
that
the
list
of
morals
has
changed
for
society
significantly
though
the
authority
element
may
come
from
our
authority
figures
and
roles
models
see
eric
berne
and
his
transactional
analysis
work
mavis
klein
for
references
and
this
is
what
gives
rise
to
a
deterioration
of
moral
standards
in
the
long
term
ive
had
some
more
thoughts
on
my
definitions
ive
was
thinking
that
i
should
add
moral
character
to
the
list
of
definitions
in
order
to
get
a
dynamic
version
of
the
moral
nature
ie
the
interplay
of
the
moral
code
and
associated
authorities
a
suitable
analogy
might
be
a
graphic
equaliser
on
a
hifi
system
the
moral
nature
being
the
set
of
frequencies
and
the
chosen
amplitudes
and
the
moral
character
being
the
spectrum
over
time
conscience
is
a
little
more
difficult
because
i
cant
define
it
as
the
reasoning
of
a
person
between
actions
in
the
context
of
his
moral
nature
because
conscience
seems
to
cut
in
most
of
the
time
unbidden
and
often
unwanted
i
think
conscience
is
manifest
when
a
decision
is
made
at
a
given
time
which
compromises
ones
moral
nature
my
conscience
fits
in
more
with
freuds
superego
plus
the
moral
driver
with
the
stimulous
being
the
urges
or
freuds
id
the
reasoning
that
i
mentioned
before
is
freuds
ego
i
suppose
if
the
moral
driver
is
part
of
the
id
then
the
reason
why
conscience
cuts
in
unbidden
is
partially
explained
the
question
is
what
provides
the
stimulous
to
activate
the
moral
driver
i
think
i
need
some
more
time
with
this
one
thats
about
it

now

david
bold
says
i
dont
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
think
that
youve
got
hold
of
the
wrong
end
of
a
different
stick
david
i
had
a
look
at
your
posting
again
and
i
see
what
you
mean
i
was
so
intent
on
explaining
how
jung
thought
we
could
be
more
moral
than
god
that
i
overlooked
your
main
line
of
thought
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
god
being
unknowable
his
morality
is
unknowable
yep
thats
pretty
much
it
im
not
a
jew
but
i
understand
that
this
is
the
jewish
way
of
thinking
however
the
jews
believe
that
the
covenant
between
yhwh
and
the
patriarchs
abraham
and
moses
in
this
case
establishes
a
moral
code
to
follow
for
mankind
even
the
jews
could
not
decide
where
the
boundaries
fall
though
as
i
understand
it
the
sadducees
believed
that
the
torah
was
all
that
was
required
whereas
the
pharisees
the
ancestors
of
modern
judaism
believed
that
the
torah
was
available
for
interpretation
to
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
required
morality
in
all
its
nuances
talmud
the
essence
of
all
of
this
is
that
biblical
morality
is
an
interface
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
anything
about
yhwh
outside
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
speculate
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
man
is
supposed
to
be
created
in
his
image
so
there
is
an
argument
that
we
are
committed
to
whatever
moral
code
he
follows
as
part
of
trying
to
live
up
to
that
image
if
we
are
supposed
to
live
by
christs
example
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
god
is
a
do
what
i
say
not
what
i
do
kind
of
guy
the
trouble
with
all
of
this
is
that
we
dont
really
know
what
the
created
in
his
image
means
ive
heard
a
number
of
different
opinions
on
this
and
have
still
not
come
to
any
conclusion
this
rather
upsets
the
apple
cart
if
one
wants
to
base
a
life
script
on
this
shaky
foundation
to
mix
metaphors
unashamedly
as
to
living
by
christs
example
we
know
very
little
about
jesus
as
a
person
we
only
have
his
recorded
utterances
in
a
set
of
narratives
by
his
followers
and
some
very
small
references
from
comtemporary
historians
revelation
aside
one
can
only
know
christ
secondhand
or
worse
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
debunk
christianity
although
it
may
seem
that
way
initially
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
we
only
really
have
the
bible
to
interpret
and
that
interpretation
is
by
humanity
i
guess
this
is
where
faith
or
relevation
comes
in
with
all
its
inherent
subjectiveness
metaphysically
if
there
are
multiple
moral
codes
then
there
is
no
absolute
moral
code
and
i
think
this
is
theologically
questionable
no
there
may
be
an
absolute
moral
code
there
are
undoubtably
multiple
moral
codes
the
multiple
moral
codes
may
be
founded
in
the
absolute
moral
code
as
an
example
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assume
that
the
parent
never
swears
simply
because
the
parent
has
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
children
the
wrongness
here
is
if
the
child
disobeys
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
swear
in
front
of
children
but
may
be
quite
happy
to
swear
in
front
of
animals
the
analogy
does
not
quite
hold
water
because
the
child
knows
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
as
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incidentally
the
young
child
considers
the
directive
as
absolute
until
he
gets
older
see
piaget
and
learns
a
morality
of
his
own

observable
fact
but
rather
a
standard
of
measurement
i
would
conclude
that
science
does
not
have
its
basis
in
values
and
so
your
statement
above
fails
in
fact
if
one
concludes
that
a
scientific
set
of
measurements
values
are
based
on
systems
derived
from
observation
then
it
must
follow
that
in
a
scientific
context
there
is
no
such
thing
as
there
is
no
such
thing
as
objective
values
back
to
the
present
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
moral
system
anyhow
just
because
the
word
values
is
used
in
both
contexts
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
two
contexts
if
one
is
to
argue
for
objective
values
in
a
moral
sense
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstrating
that
morality
itself
is
objective
considering
the
meaning
of
the
word
objective
i
doubt
that
this
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
original
question
and
objective
morality
is
if
you
can
provide
an
objective
foundation
for
morality
then
that
will
be
a
good
beginning

irrelevant
to
you
and
your
personal
beliefs
or
should
i
say
bias
but
it
is
relevant
to
me
and
many
others
youre
right
the
bottom
line
is
truth
independant
from
you
or
anyone
else
since
you
proclaim
truths
as
a
selfproclaimed
appointee
may
i
ask
you
by
what
authority
you
do
this
because
it
says
so
in
the
bible
does
the
bible
say
so
or
is
it
you
or
someone
else
who
interprets
whether
a
scripture
or
doctrine
conforms
to
your
particular
liking
or
disapproval
excuse
moi
but
your
line
of
truths
havent
moved
me
one
bit
to
persuade
me
that
my
beliefs
are
erroneous
of
all
the
preachers
of
truth
on
this
net
you
have
struck
me
as
a
selfrighteous
member
of
the
wrecking
crew
with
no
positive
message
to
me
or
other
latterday
saints
whatsoever
btw
this
entire
discussion
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
things
said
by
jesus
to
the
pharisees
ye
hypocrites
ye
preach
about
me
with
your
lips
but
your
hearts
are
far
removed
from
me
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
sophistry
look
whos
talking
jumping
to
conclusions
you
wouldnt
do
that
yourself
right
all
you
address
is
your
own
convictions
regardless
whether
we
come
up
with
any
biblical
scriptures
which
supports
our
points
of
view
because
you
reject
such
interpretations
without
any
consideration
whatsoever
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
a
beautiful
example
of
disinformation
and
a
deliberate
misrepresentation
of
lds
doctrine
the
former
kgb
would
have
loved
to
employ
you
jesus
and
lucifer
are
not
the
same
silly
and
you
know
it
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
correction
it
may
contradict
would
you
think
the
bible
says
the
bible
indeed
does
teach
that
not
all
are
children
of
god
in
the
sense
that
they
belong
to
or
follow
god
in
his
footsteps
satan
and
his
followers
have
rebelled
against
god
and
are
not
children
followersredeemed
of
god
but
it
doesnt
mean
that
they
were
not
once
created
by
god
but
chose
to
separate
themselves
from
those
who
chose
to
follow
god
and
his
plan
of
salvation
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
matthew
so
this
illustrates
nicely
what
i
just
said
the
children
of
the
kingdom
are
those
who
have
remained
valiant
in
their
testimony
of
jesus
and
have
shown
works
of
repentance
etc
and
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
are
those
who
rebelled
against
god
and
the
lamb
the
issue
of
satans
spiritoffspring
and
those
who
followed
him
has
not
been
addressed
in
this
and
other
verses
you
copied
from
your
bible
you
purposefully
obscured
the
subject
by
swamping
your
right
with
non
related
scriptures
lots
of
nice
scriptures
deleted
not

though
ra
we
are
told
that
and
this
is
life
eternal
that
they
might
know
ra
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
ra
john
life
eternal
is
to
know
the
only
true
god
yet
the
ra
doctrines
of
the
lds
that
i
have
mentioned
portray
a
vastly
ra
different
jesus
a
jesus
that
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
of
ra
the
bible
they
are
so
far
removed
from
each
other
that
to
proclaim
correction
my
jesus
is
indeed
different
than
your
jesus
and
can
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
in
the
bible
not
your
interpretation
of
him
i
concur
but
i
honestly
couldnt
care
less
ra
one
as
being
true
denies
the
other
from
being
true
according
to
the
ra
bible
eternal
life
is
dependent
on
knowing
the
only
true
god
and
ra
not
the
construct
of
imagination
in
this
single
posting
of
yours
ive
seen
more
constructs
of
imagination
than
in
all
of
the
prolds
mails
combined
i
have
read
so
far
in
this
news
group
first
get
your
ldsfacts
straight
before
you
dare
preaching
to
us
about
the
only
true
god
whom
you
interpret
according
to
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
but
whose
image
i
cannot
reconcile
with
what
i
know
about
him
myself
i
guess
your
grandiose
selfimage
does
not
allow
for
other
faiths
believing
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
but
in
a
different
way
or
fashion
than
your
own
not
that
it
really
matters
the
mission
and
progress
of
the
lds
church
will
go
on
boldly
and
nobly
and
no
mob
or
opponent
can
stop
the
work
from
progressing
until
it
has
visited
every
continent
swept
every
clime
and
sounded
in
every
ear
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
sigh
what
the
bible
teaches
or
what
the
bible
teaches
according
to
robert
weiss
and
co
i
respect
the
former
i
reject
the
latter
without
the
remotest
feeling
that
i
have
rejected
jesus
on
the
contrary
and
by
the
way
i
do
respect
your
interpretations
of
the
bible
i
even
grant
you
being
a
christian
following
your
own
image
of
him
as
much
as
i
am
a
christian
following
my
own
image
of
him
in
my
heart
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies
writings
indicative
of
mormon
belief
on
this
subject
is
the
real
issue
the
indication
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainly
be
the
issue
is
of
course
that
you
love
to
use
anything
to
either
mis
represent
or
ridicule
the
lds
church
the
issue
of
official
doctrine
is
obviously
very
important
mcconkies
views
have
been
controversial
eg
the
seven
deadly
heresies
has
made
me
a
heretic
at
best
or
erroneous
at
worst
blacks
not
to
receive
the
priesthood
in
this
dispensation
i
respect
him
as
someone
who
has
made
his
valuable
contribution
to
the
church
but
i
personally
do
not
rely
on
his
personal
interpretations
his
book
mormon
doctrine
is
oftentimes
referred
to
as
mcconkies
bible
in
mormon
circles
on
mormon
doctrine
i
rather
look
to
official
doctrinal
sources
and
to
hugh
nibleys
books
the
last
comment
is
an
ldsinsider
reference
summarizing
mcconkie
was
a
wise
man
who
contributed
undoubtedly
far
more
to
the
kingdom
of
god
than
i
have
but
whose
views
are
by
no
means
dogma
or
accepted
doctrine
some
of
it
clearly
belongs
to
personal
interpretation
and
speculation
but
having
said
this
i
find
mcconkie
even
in
his
most
biased
and
speculative
moments
far
more
thoughtprovoking
than
the
trash
coming
from
your
proverbial
pen
im
somewhat
appalled
that
i
have
allowed
myself

if
there
is
a
western
ethic
against
infanticide
why
are
so
many
children
dying
all
over
the
world
the
majority
of
the
world
isnt
western
superficially
a
good
answer
but
it
isnt
that
simple
an
awful
lot
of
the
starvation
and
poverty
in
the
world
is
directly
caused
by
the
economic
policies
of
the
western
countries
as
well
as
by
the
diet
of
the
typical
westerner
for
instance
some
thirdworld
countries
with
terrible
malnutrition
problems
export
all
the
soya
they
can
produce
so
that
it
can
be
fed
to
cattle
in
the
us
to
make
tender
juicy
steaks
and
burgers
they
have
to
do
this

get
money
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
crippling
bank
loans
we
encouraged
them
to
take
out
fundraising
for
ethiopia
is
a
truly
bizarre
idea
instead
we
ought
to
stop
bleeding
them
for
every
penny
theyve
got
perhaps
its
more
accurate
to
say
that
theres
a
western
ethic
against
western
infanticide
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
so
long
as
the
children
are
dying
in
the
third
world
we
couldnt
give
a
shit
and
that
goes
for
the
supposed
prolife
movement
too
they
could
save
far
more
lives
by
fighting
against
third
world
debt
than
they
will
by
fighting
against
abortion
hell
if
theyre
only
interested
in
fetuses
they
could
save
more
of
those
by
fighting
for
human
rights
in
china
and
besides
suzannes
answer
implies
that
nonwestern
countries
lack
this
ethic
against
infanticide
apart
from
china

its

world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
matthew
so
this
illustrates
nicely
what
i
just
said
the
children
of
the
kingdom
are
those
who
have
remained
valiant
in
their
testimony
of
jesus
and
have
shown
works
of
repentance
etc
and
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
are
those
who
rebelled
against
god
and
the
lamb
the
issue
of
satans
spiritorigin
and
of
those
who
followed
him
has
not
been
addressed
in
this
and
other

copied
from

purposefully
obscured

though
ra
we
are
told
that
and
this
is
life
eternal
that
they
might
know

thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
ra
john
life
eternal
is
to
know
the
only
true
god
yet
the
ra
doctrines
of
the
lds
that
i
have
mentioned
portray
a
vastly
ra
different
jesus
a
jesus
that
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
of
ra
the
bible
they
are
so
far
removed
from
each
other
that
to
proclaim
correction
my
jesus
is
indeed
different
than
your
jesus
and
can
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
in
the
bible
not
your
interpretation
of
him
i
concur
but
i
honestly
couldnt
care
less
ra
one
as
being
true
denies
the
other
from
being
true
according
to
the
ra
bible
eternal
life
is
dependent
on
knowing
the
only
true
god
and
ra
not
the
construct
of
imagination
in
this
single
posting
of
yours
ive
seen
more
constructs
of
imagination
than
in
all
of
the
prolds
mails
combined
i
have
read
so
far
in
this
news
group
first
get
your
ldsfacts
straight
before
you
dare
preaching
to
us
about
the
only
true
god
whom
you
interpret
according
to
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
but
whose
image
i
cannot
reconcile
with
what
i
know
about
him
myself
i
guess
your
grandiose
selfimage
does
not
allow
for
other
faiths
believing
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
but
in
a
different
way
or
fashion
than
your
own
not
that
it
really
matters
the
mission
and
progress
of
the
lds
church
will
go
on
boldly
and
nobly
and
no
mob
or
opponent
can
stop
the
work
from
progressing
until
it
has
visited
every
continent
swept
every
clime
and
sounded
in
every
ear
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
sigh
what
the
bible
teaches
or
what
the
bible
teaches
according
to
robert
weiss
and
co
i
respect
the
former
i
reject
the
latter
without
the
remotest
feeling
that
i
have
rejected
jesus
on
the
contrary
and
by
the
way
i
do
respect
your
interpretations
of
the
bible
i
even
grant
you
being
a
christian
following
your
own
image
of
him
as
much
as
i
am
a
christian
following
my
own
image
of
him
in
my
heart
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies
writings
indicative
of
mormon
belief
on
this
subject
is
the
real
issue
the
indication
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainly
be
the
issue
is
of
course
that
you
love
to
use
anything
to
either
mis
represent
or
ridicule
the
lds
church
the
issue
of
official
doctrine
is
obviously
very
important
mcconkies
views
have
been
controversial
eg
the
seven
deadly
heresies
has
made
me
a
heretic
at
best
or
erroneous
at
worst
blacks
not
to
receive
the
priesthood
in
this
dispensation
i
respect
him
as
someone
who
has
made
his
valuable
contribution
to
the
church
but
i
personally
do
not
rely
on
his
personal
interpretations
his
book
mormon
doctrine
is
oftentimes
referred
to
as
mcconkies
bible
in
mormon
circles
on
mormon
doctrine
i
rather
look
to
official
doctrinal
sources
and
to
hugh
nibleys
books
the
last
comment
is
an
ldsinsider
reference
summarizing
mcconkie
was
a
wise
man
who
contributed
undoubtedly
far
more
to
the
kingdom
of
god
than
i
have
but
whose
views
are
by
no
means
dogma
or
accepted
doctrine
some
of
it
clearly
belongs
to
personal
interpretation
and
speculation
but
having
said
this
i
find
mcconkie
even
in
his
most
biased
and
speculative
moments
far
more
thoughtprovoking
than
the
trash
coming
from
your
proverbial
pen
im
somewhat
appalled
that

its

people
while
jews
consider
this
to

christian
antisemitism
comes
from
the
obvious
fact
that
the
jews
should
know
the
hebrew
scriptures
better
than
anyone
else
yet
they
did
not
convert
to
christianity
en
mass
thus
rejecting
christian

no
wonder
this

antisemitism
one
might
even
wonder
that
if

would
antisemitism
have
even

dont

why
not

to
the

culture
is
seen
as
different

undesirable
in
the
west
particular
in
the
us
with
its
failed
melting

concept
most
tribes
have
been
hunted

extinction
the
hebrew
tribe
is
one
of
the
few
survivers
from
the
neolithic
of
course
it
becomes
difficult
at
times
to
separate

perhaps
you

its

its

often

believe

that
islam
is

tied

the
observation

the

of
life
would
rotate
clockwise
in
the
northern
hemisphere

counterclockwise

probably
doesnt

enough
consideration
to
the
feebleness
of
the
coriolis
force
compared
to
say
the
phototropism
of
vegetation
a
much
more
likely
explanation
is
the
classic
one
that
the
clockwise
swastika
is
the
sunwheel
because
the
sun
progresses
across
the
sky
that
way
although
thats
not
the
historical
way
it
happened
clocks
were
first
made
as
little
imitation
images
of
the
sun
moving
thru
the
heavens
so
its
more
valid
to
talk
of
the
clock
going
sunwise
but
do
the
engineers
listen
to
me
of
course
not
anyway
there
is
still
much
uncertainty
about
whether
the
antiswastika
goes
countersunwise
because
that
represents
evil
or
because
it
is
the
suns
twinopposite
the
moonwheel
the
use
of
antisun
to
represent
evil
may
be
because
humans
are
so
strongly
visuallyoriented

im
not
going

try

settle
that
one

individuals
quoting

is
not
the

as
quoting
the

taken
out
of
context
words
can
be
interpreted
much
differently
than
had
one
applied
them
within
the
confines
of
their
original
expression
i
think
this
is
the
case
regarding
hymenaeus
beta
frater
superior
of
the
order
to
which
i
belong
when
he
included
that
bit
from
merlinus
x
he
did
us
all
a
service
he
showed
us
the
extremes
to
which
order
members
have
been
known
to
go
in
their
fervor
i
have
little
knowledge
regarding
reuss
background
but
surely
he
was
an
unusual
man
and
he
was
an
important
force
in
the
order
for
many
years
yet
as
people
change
so
do
orders
change
and
while
we
look
back
so
carefully
at
the
dirty
laundry
of
oto
remember
that
this
is
only
the
surface
skim
and
that
many
perspectives
are
now
encompassed
which
extend
beyond
any
one
individual
i
hope
to
show
that
there
was
and
is
much
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion
within
the
order
itself
perhaps
by
testing
the
limits
myself
let
us
examine
this
issue
a
bit
more
closely
in
karl
kellner
a
wealthy
austrian
industrialist
and
paper
chemist
as
well
as
a
highgrade
mason
founded
the
ordo
templi
orientis
kellner
had
traveled
widely
in
the
east
where
he
met
three
adepts
who
instructed
him
specific
magical
practices
kellners
efforts
to
develop
the
order
were
later
assisted
by
franz
hartmann
heinrich
klein
and
theodore
reuss
who
had
worked
together
prior
to
joining
the
oto
the
order
was
first
proclaimed
in
in
reusss
masonic
publication
oriflamme
on
kellners
death
reuss
succeeded
him
as
outer
head
oho
the
jubilee
edition
of
the
oriflamme
published
in
announced
that
the
order
taught
secret
of
sexual
magic
theodore
reuss
was
an
interesting
character
born
june
in
augsburg
he
entered
masonry
in
he
was
a
singer
journalist
and
possibly
a
spy
for
the
prussian
political
police
infiltrating
the
socialist
league
founded
by
karl
marxs
daughter
and
her
husband
reuss
was
later
associated
with
william
wynn
westcott
a
leader
of
the
golden
dawn
who
later
introduced
him
to
john
yarker
yarker
chartered
reuss
to
found
the
rites
of
memphis
and
mizraim
in
germany
after
several
attempts
to
concretize
various
masonic
rites
reuss
settled
on
the
development
of
the
oto
the
order
experienced
reasonably
steady
growth
under
reuss
leadership
for
example
he
chartered
papus
in
france
rudolph
steiner
in
berlin
and
h
spencer
lewis
in
the
usa
in
the
historic
meeting
between
reuss
and
crowley
occurred
crowley
wrote
that
reuss
came
to
him
and
accused
him
of
revealing
order
secrets
when
crowley
looked
at
it
afresh
the
initiated
interpretation
of
sexual
magick
unfolded
itself
to
him
for
the
first
time
reuss
appointed
crowley
as
supreme
and
holy
king
of
all
the
english
speaking
world
and
it
was
this
authorization
that
he
invoked
when
publishing
the
material
of
the
equinox
reuss
resigned
as
outer
head
of
the
order
in
after
suffering
a
stroke
and
named
crowley
his
successor
all
was
well
until
when
the
book
of
the
law
was
translated
into
german
there
was
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
order
manyk
members
split
with
the
new
oho
over
the
book
which
crowley
was
actively
promulgating
through
the
order
he
had
earlier

reusss
request
deeply

doctrines
of

edited
by
hymenaeus
beta
frater
superior
rex
summus
sanctissimus
caliph
of
the
united
states
of
america
published
by
samuel
weiser
there
are
many
possible
reasons
that
our
frater
superior
included
this
material
in
equinox
and
this
is
the
real
point
is
it
not
why
did
he
wish
to
publish
such
things
about
the
history
of
his
own
organization
does
he
represent
a
dogmatic
threat
to
the
principle
of
thelema
or
is
he
exercising
his
true
will
and
putting
forth
very
complex
pictures
with
no
easy
answers
a
picture
which
leaves
room
for
very
many
interpretations
it
is
quite
easy
for
me
to
see
for
example
that
all
of
oto
derived
out
of
the
dribble
of
faltering
masonry
purchased
by
clever
hucksters
with
an
ounce
of
courage
and
some
writing
ability
to
aid
them
and
i
can
take
that
all
the
way
down
to
our
present
caliph
whose
feeble
support
of
the
law
of
thelema
is
laughable
at
best
would
i
be
thrown
out
of
the
order
for
speaking
in
this
way
will
i
i
think
not
why
because
my
frater
will
see
it
as
a
perspective
an
interjection
i
am
using
as
an
example
my
illustration
shows
that
we
may
express
things
in
the
context
of
a
larger
work
and
the
true
significance
of
this
may
be
quite
difficult
to
apprehend
at
first
so
it
may
be
with
oto
and
merlinus
x
please
look
oto
more
carefully
i
do
not
support
reusss
words
myself
as
i
am
not
qualified
to
assess
them
and
i
am
critical
of
their
pomposity
if
i
who
am
a
member
of
the
order
take
such
a
stand
and
am
allowed
to
continue
doing
so
then
what
can
this
say
about
the
health
of
the
order
does
it
mean
that
the
order
has
gone
soft
and
abandoned
its
moral
principles
or
does
it
mean
that
it
is
strong
in
its
ability
to
let
the
will
of
universal
kinship
arise
on
its
own
not
shackled
by
some
dogmatic
requirement
how
shall
we
resolve
these
two
possibilities
i
find
a
high
calibre
of
individual
associated
with
ordo
templi
orientis
they
are
often
quite
intelligent
and
sometimes
very
well
versed
in
arcane
or
usual
information
they
are
quite
often
artists
and
geniuses
having
met
some
longstanding
members
in
the
sf
bay
area
many
who
are
or
were
very
heavily
involved
with
the
order
i
can
vouch
for
the
integrity
of
the
organization
as
it
stands
i
have
sometimes
questioned
the
policy
of
hymenaeus
beta
in
these
moments
i
followed
my
intuition
and
ive
found
little
to
stop
me
from
requesting
a
second
initiation
from
a
different
oto
body
im
happily
participating
in
social
groups
feasts
or
initiations
and
have
come
to
know
the
gnostic
mass
well
enough
for
my
tastes
this
doesnt
make
me
an
authority
on
order
politics
and
explanations
however
i
can
only
hypothesize
and
relay
to
you
what
i
understand
based
on
my
limited
contact
with
other
members
i
urge
you
not
to
take
the
words
of
merlinus
x
too
far
there
are
many
ways
to
interpret
words
and
many
people
who
have
become
involved
with
the
order
feel
very
strongly
about
the
sanctity
of
personal
freedom
and
the
preservation
of
individual
vision
i
welcome
other
comment
on
this
issue
and
will
be

perhaps
you
should
read
it
and
stop
advancing
the
bible
as
evidence
relating
to
questions
of
science
it
did
jesus
exist
by
g
a
wells
there
is
a
great
fallacy
in
your
statement
the
question
of
origins
is
based
on
more
than
science
alone
nope
no
fallacy
yep
science
is
best
in
determining
how
religions
handle
why
and
who
the
problem
is
that
most
scientists
exclude
the
possibility
of
the
supernatural
in
the
question
of
origins
is
this
is
a
fair
premise
not
entirely
its
not
a
premise
its
a
conclusion
second
that
scientists
for
the
most
part
exlude
the
possibility
is
not
a
problem
its
a
necessity
scientists
are
empircists
not
theologians
i
utterly
reject
the
hypothesis
that
science
is
the
highest
form
of
truth
so
do
scientists
and
long
before
you
did
clearly
you
have
a
deep
and
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
science
if
you
met
a
man
who
could
walk
on
water
raise
people
from
the
dead
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
god
and
then
referred
to
the
inviolability
of
the
scriptures
this
would
affect
your
belief
in
the
origin
of
man
i
can
expand
on
this
nope
wouldnt
affect
my
knowledge
not
belief
of
origins
of
anatomically
modern
humans
if
that
man
could
show
me
something
better
id
change
even
if
it
was
the
biblical
story
in
exact
detail
but
then
i
would
ask
why
in
the
world
did
your
father
endow
us
with
intellect
and
reason
and
then
proceed
to
fool
us
i
mean
the
bible
says
nothing
about
the
humanlike
creatures
that
we
know
exist
some
of
these
socalled
humanlike
creatures
were
apes
some
were
humans
some
were
fancifully
reconstructed
from
fragments
absolutely
and
utterly
false
except
for
some
were
amhs
lucy
australopithecus
afarensis
ca
to
mya
is
complete
and
about
taking
into
consideration
bilateral
symmetry
lucy
walked
upright
and
bipedally
just
like
humans
and
the
two
share
a
remarkably
similar
dental
pattern
her
cranial
morphology
is
unlike
humans
or
modern
apes
there
are
hundreds
of
other
specimens
of
this
and
other
species
of
which
only
some
are
partially
reconstructed
they
exist
bill
you
can
touch
them
feel
them
hold
them
but
forget
hominids
the
earth
the
universe
the
cultural
record
all
look
and
test
out
as
ancient
indeed
they
are
not
reconstructions
has
god
has
tricked
us
here
too
it
wont
go
away
bill
i
doubt
any
of
us
will
meet
a
man
like
this
but
bill
if
your
version
of
all
this
is
absolutely
correct
im
still
no
worried
about
my
salvation
ill
probaby
make
it
i
dont
steal
murder
covet
etc
and
i
like
to
help
other
people
all
i
did
was
use
the
reason
and
intellect
your
god
provided
he
or
she
benevolent
and
loving
will
understand
my
dilemma
dont
you
think
good
deeds
do
not
justify
a
person
in
gods
sight
an
atonement
jesus
is
needed
to
atone
for
sin
so
you
and
other
fundamentalists
say
what
about
the
billions
who
dont
say
so
beware
of
people
who
say
they
have
the
truth
bill
and
reconsider
each
time
you
think
you
do
science
and
the
bible
are
not
in
contradiction
god
can
supercede
the
scientific
laws
as
man
understands
them
creation
is
a
good
example
god
has
the
power
to
create
something
out
of
nothing
order
out
of
chaos
havent
been
on
to
long
but
i
have
a
feeling
bill
that
the
veterans
will
agree
with
you
here
no
contradiciton
and
god
can
do
anything
at
will
so
whats
the
beef
or
more
properly
wheres
my
point
god
is
the
creator
looks
like
we
agree
that
was
not
your
point
bill
your
point
above
was
god
has
the
power
scientists
generally
agree
with
that
thats
a
far
cry
from
saying
god
did
please
attempt
to
understand
your
own
posts
if
the
title
of
the
book
you
mentioned
has
anything
to
do
with
the
substance
of
the
book
it
must
be
a
real
laugher
of
course
jesus
existed
and
there
are
volumes
of
evidence
to
back
it
up
i
can
give
many
if
you
are
interested
its
not
a
laugher
bill
its
a
scholarly
book
that
many
happen
to
disagree
with
i
am
definitely
and
seriously
interested
in
confirmation
i
know
of
the
bible
inferences
therefrom
eg
prophecies
apocrypha
the
koran
and
others
what
i
am
interested
is
independent
evidence
do
you
have
any
i
know
of
josephus
but
this
is
almost
certainly
an
insertion
also
i
know

firstcentury
greek
is
wellknown
and
wellunderstood
have
you
considered
josephus
the
jewish
historian
who
also
wrote
of
jesus
in
addition
the
four
gospel
accounts
are
very
much
in
harmony
bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblical
scholars
consider
the
josephus
reference
to
be
an
early
christian
insert
by
biblical
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
research
is
willing
to
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
this
excludes
literalists
who
may
otherwise
be
defined
as
biblical
apologists
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthy
by
scholarly
standards
and
others
why
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
times
the
passage
is
glaringly
out
of
context
and
josephus
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewhere
in
his
work
the
passage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lies
it
suddenly
appears
and
then
just
as
quickly
disappears
until
you
can
demonstrate
how
and
why
the
scholarly
community
is
wrong
about
the
josephus
insert
your
proof
is
meaningless
and
it
should
not
be
repeated
here
whats
more
even
if
josephus
happened
to
be
legitimate
it
would
prove
nothing
scholars
speak
of
the
weight
of
evidence
far
more
independent
evidence
would
be
required
to
validate
your
claim
until
forthcoming
your
belief
is
based
on
faith
thats
ok
but
you
exceed
your
rights
when
you
pass
faith
off
as
fact
as
for
the
gospels
there
are
parallels
but
there
are
also
glaring
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
shouldnt
a
perfect
canon
be
perfect
shouldnt
there
be
absolutely
no
room
for
debate
i
suggest
you
read
gospel
fictions
by
randel
helms
and
the
unauthorized
version
by
robin
fox
for
herb
huston
no
known
kinship
or
familial
relationship
but
we
do
indeed
share
an
evolutionary
ancestry
the
fact
that
there
are
inconsistencies
gaps
and
contradictions
does
not
deny
your
position
on
the
other
hand
neither
do
the
gospels
prove
your
faith
independent
evidence
is
necessary
and
i
know
of
none
which
we
have
already
discussed
and
so
far
you
have
not
provided
any
until
then
its
faith
moreover
you
have
committed
a
fundamental
error
in
logic
you
have
attempted
to
prove
your
claim
with
that
which
you
want
to
prove
its
no
different
than
saying
i
am
right
because
i
say
so
your
logic
is
full
of
circles
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
presbyterian
general
assembly
the
assembly
defined
five
fundamentals
this
is
where
fundamentalist
came
from
of
orthodox
protestant
christianity
to
wit
jesus
performed
miracles
jesus
was
born
of
a
virgin
jesus
was
bodily
resurrected
jesus
crucifixion
atoned
for
human
sin
and
here
is
the
clincher
the
bible
is
the
inerrant
word
of
god
presbyterians
construe
inerrant
broadly
as
spritually
inerrant
fundamentalists
take
the
first
four
as
literally
true
and
then
validate
them
with
a
literally
inerrant
bible
which
contains
the
first
four
and
which
is
the
only
thing
known
to
contain
the
first
four
smoke

unfortunately
from

we

has
been
portrayed
by

when
a

action
takes
place
in

it
is
always
played
up
as
an

however
when
the
a
serbian

attacks
the

its
not
a
christian
terrorist
its
just
a

i
have
often
tried
to
explain
this
to
some
close
friends
who
believe
the
press
that
islam
is
somehow
tied
to
violence
often
times
you
hear
things
like
they
just
dont
value
human

like
we
do

so

was
wondering

anyone
out
there
had
any
suggestions
for
how
we
can
change

how
i
can

muhammad

verse
whose
rough
translation
is
as
follows
muhammad
is
not
the
father
of
any
of
your
men
but
he
is
the
messenger
of
allah
and
the
seal
of
the

all
things

the
holy
prophet
muhammad

closed
the
long
line
of
messengers
allahs
teaching
is
and
will
always
be
continuous
but
there
has
been
and
will
be
no
prophet
after
muhammad
saw
the
later
ages
will
want
thinkers
and
revivers
not
prophets
this
is
not

have
the
certainty
of
confirmation
by
consensus
of
ulema
scholars
of
islam
to
the
hundreth
degree
the
miracle
is
the
conformation
by
the
creator
of
the
universe
of
his
declaration
of
prophethood
it
has
the
effect
of
the
wordsyou
have
indeed
spoken
the
truth
suppose
that
you
said
in
the
assembly
of
a
ruler
while
being
observed
by
him
the
true
ruler
has
appointed
me
to
such
and
such
position
at
a
time
when
you
were
asked
to
prove
your
claim
the
word
yes
uttered
by
the
ruler
would
sufficiently
support
you
or
if
the
ruler
changed
his
usual
practice
and
attitude
at
your
request
this
would
confirm
your
claim
even
more
soundly
and
more
definitely
than
would
the
word
yes
in
the
same
way
allahs
most
noble
messenger
claimed
i
am
the
envoy
of
the
creator
of
this
universe
my
proof
is
that
he
will
change
his
unbroken
order
at
my
request
and
my
prayer
now
look
at
my
fingers
he
makes
them
run
like
a
fountain
with
five
spigots
look
at
the
moon
by
a
gesture
of
my
finger
he
splits
it
in
two
look
at
that
tree
to
affirm
me
and
to
bear
witness
to
me
it
moves
and
comes
near

me
look
at
this
food
although
it
is
barely
enough
for
two
or
three
men
it
satisfies
two
or
three
hundred
further
he
shows
hundreds
of
similar
miracles
however
the
evidences
of
the
veracity
of
this
high
being
and
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
are
not
restricted
to
his
miracles
all
his
deeds
and
acts
his
words
and
behavior
his
moral
conduct
and
manners
his
character
and
appearance
prove
to
the
attentive
his
truthfulness
and
seriousness
indeed
many
people
such
as
abdullah
b
salam
the
famous
scholar
of
the
children
of
israel
came
to
belief
merely
by
seeing
him
and
said
no
lie
can
hide
in
this
face
nor
can
any
fraud
be
found
in
it
although
many
of
the
researchers
have
concluded
that
the
proofs
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
and
his
miracles
number
about
one
thousand
there
are
thousands
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
of
proofs
of
his
prophethood
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
truthseeking
men
muhakkikiin
with
varying
opinions
have
affirmed
his
prophethood
in
an
equal
number
of
ways
the
wise
ouran
alone
demonstrates
thousands
of
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
in
addition
to
its
own
forty
aspects
of
miraculousness
since
prophethood
is
as
a
phenomenon
of
humanity
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals
who
claimed
prophethood
and
performed
miracles
have
lived
and
passed
away
then
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
saw
is
of
a
certanity
superior
to
that
of
the
prophethood
of
all
the
others
for
whatever
evidences
qualities
and
attributes
became
the
means
of
the
prophethood
and

of
all
the
messengers
such
as
jesus
as
and
moses
as
they
are
all
owned
in
a
more
perfect
and
comprehensive
fashion
by
muhammad
saw
and
since
the
causes
and
means
of
prophetic
authority
exist
more
perfectly
in
the
person
of
muhammad

this
authority
is
to
be

also
wrote
of

in
addition
the
four
gospel
accounts
are
very
much
in
harmony
bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblical
scholars
consider
the
josephus
reference
to
be
an
early
christian
insert
by
biblical
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
research
is
willing
to
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
this
excludes
literalists
who
may
otherwise
be
defined
as
biblical
apologists
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthy
by
scholarly
standards
and
others
why
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
times
the
passage
is
glaringly
out
of
context
and
josephus
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewhere
in
his
work
the
passage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lies
it
suddenly
appears
and
then
just
as
quickly
disappears
i
think
this
is
a
weak
argument
the
fact
is
there
are
two
references
to
jesus
in
antiquities
of
the
jews
one
of
which
has
unquestionably
at
least
been
altered
by
christians
origen
wrote
in
the
third
century
that
josephus
did
not
recognize
jesus
as
the
messiah
while
the
long
passage
says
the
opposite
there
is
an
arabic
manuscript
of
antiquities
of
the
jews
which
contains
a
version
of
the
passage
which
is
much
less
gungho
for
jesus
and
may
be
authentic
there
is
no
question
that
origen
in
the
third
century
saw
a
reference
to
jesus
in
josephus
there
are
no
manuscripts
of
antiquities
which
lack
the
references
it
is
possible
that
it
was
fabricated
out
of
whole
cloth
and
inserted
but
i
dont
think
its
very
likelynor
do
i
think
there
is
a
consensus
in
the
scholarly
community
that
this
is
the
case
i
know
ga
wells
takes
this
position
but
thats
because
he
takes
the
very
small
minority
view
that
jesus
never
existed
and
he
is
a
professor
of
german
not
of
biblical
history
or
new
testament
or
anything
directly
relevant
to
the
historicity

the
trouble
with
trying

find

the

is
that
roehm
and
his
buddies
were
accused
of
being
flaming
faggots
one
of
the
pretexts
for
the
night
of
long
knives
in
which
roehm
and
most
of
the
sa
wing
of
the
nsdap
were
purged
stop
hold
it
you
have
a
few
problems
here
official
history
says
that
the
first
accusations
of
homosexuality
in
the
sa
came
from
outside
of
the
nazi
party
long
before
the
nazis
ever
came
to
power
so
this
objection
is
a
red
herring
even
if
established
history
is
wrong
on
this
point
moreover
none
of
the
histories
ive
read
ever
made
mention
of
hitler
or
anyone
else
ever
using
homosexuality
as
a
pretext
for
purging
roehm
a
point
i
saw
reiterated
was
that
hitler
and
the
party
covered
up
these
accusations
if
you
are
going
to
accuse
official
history
of
being
a
fabrication
you
should
at
least
get
your
facts
right
the
pretext
for
purging
roehm
was
that
he
was
planning
to
use
the
sa
in
a
coup
against
hitler
nowhere
is
there
mention
of
using
allegations
of
homosexuality
as
a
pretext
for
the
purge
nor
as
a
justification
afterwards
it
is
possible
that
the
histories
ive
read
have
not
mentioned
this
but
i
doubt
it
would
it
be
in
hitlers
best
interest
to
admit
to
the
world
that
his
former
right
hand
man
was
a
homosexual
anyway
as
i
said
before
it
is
always
possible
that
i
have
missed
references
to
the
nazis
making
use
of
charges
of
homosexuality
against
the
sa
after
the
night
of
the
long
knives
but
this
does
not
prove
that
they
were
false
even
the
nazis
could
tell
the
truth
when
it
was
to
their
advantage
in
any
case
this
does
not
deal
with
accusations
of
homosexuality
in
the
sa
during
the
since
the
accusers
thereafter
controlled
the
records
anything
bearing
on
the
subject
true
or
not
has
to
be
considered
tainted
evidence
ah
yes
i
forgot
this
was
being
posted
to
altconspiracy
i
can
smell
the
paranoia
from
here
since
the
nazis
never
officially
charged
roehm
with
homosexuality
at
least
not
according
to
what
ive
read
id
like
to
know
what
tainted
evidence
you
are
talking
about
since
the
accusations
were
made
by
persons
outside
of
the
nazi
party
long
before
it
came
to
power
and
those
accusations
were
common
knowledge
to
journalists
and
others
in
germany
in
the
and
just
how
would
it
be
possible
for
the
nazis
to
go
back
in
time
and
plant
tainted
evidence
how
exactly
does
one
doctor
newspapers
which
were
circulated
around
the
world
without
the
discrepancies
being
obvious
what
actual
incidences
of
nazi
doctoring
evidence
on
this
matter
do
you
know
about
and
what
about
the
testimony
of
people
who
were
involved
in
these
matters
some
of
whom
were
not
nazis
and
what
is
the
point
of
making
a
false
accusation
of
homosexuality
if
you
do
not
publicize
it
since
the
point
here
seems
to
be
to
discredit
established
history
then
the
burden
of
proof
falls
on
the
revisionist
the
revisionists
had
better
do
their
homework
before
making
accusations
otherwise
they
simply
look
like
conspiracy
nuts
the
available
data
suggest
that
roehm
and
his
crowd
the
sa
sturmabteilung
storm
troopers
left
the
world
a
better
place
when
they
departed
this
is
just
about
the
only
thing
we
agree
on
i
suspect
that
the
notion
that
there
might
have
been
bad
people
roehm
and
his
sa
buddies
who
were
homosexuals
must
disturb
some
people
the
feeling
seems
to
be
that
if
a
nasty
individual
is
accused
of
homosexuality
that
this
must
be
an
attempt
to
bash
homosexuals
this
fear
often
justified
is
what
lies
behind
this
distrust
of
official
history
or
so
it
seems
to
me
but
this
is
not
a
good
justification
for
trashing
accepted
accounts
of
this
subject
if
you
really
think
that
historians
are
so
incompetent
why
dont
you
write
them
and
ask
where
they
got
their
sources
on
this
subject
if
you
cant
tell
from
their
footnotes
im
a
graduate
student
in
history
writing
to
professors
and
tracking
down
sources
is
old
hat
but
my
time
is
limited
and
this
is
not
my
specialty
and
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
have
said
anything
that
would
cast
one
shred
of
doubt
on
existing
evidence
im
not
going
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
debunk
someones
paranoia
do
the
research
yourself
but
concrete
particulars
are
still
no
more
than
more

less
shrewd
guesses

re
clarification
of
personal
position
jesus
and
the
law
sandviknewtonapplecom

sandvik
writes
my
online
bible
is
on
a
cd
but
i
dont
own
a
cdrom
system
for
the
time
being
so
i
cant
search
for
the
famous
cite
where
jesus
explicitly
states
that
he
didnt
want
to
break
existing
jewish
laws
in
other
words
technically
speaking
christians
should
use
saturday
and
not
sunday
as
their
holy
day
if
they
want
to
conform
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
i
think
the
passage
youre
looking
for
is
the
following
matthew
think
not
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
and
the
prophets
i
have
come
not
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfil
them
matthew
for
truly
i
say
to
you
till
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
an
iota
not
a
dot
will
pass
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
matthew
whoever
then
relaxes
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
men
so
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
who
does
them
and
teaches
them
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
matthew
for
i
tell
you
unless
your
righteousness
exceeds
that
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
you
will
never
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
there
are
several
problems
with
this
the
most
serious
is
that
the
law
was
regarded
by
jews
at
the
time
and
now
as
binding
on
jews
but
not
on
gentiles
there
are
rules
that
were
binding
on
all
human
beings
the
socalled
noachic
laws
but
they
are
quite
minimal
the
issue
that
the
church
had
to
face
after
jesus
death
was
what
to
do
about
gentiles
who
wanted
to
follow
christ
the
decision
not
to
impose
the
law
on
them
didnt
say
that
the
law
was
abolished
it
simply
acknowledged
that
fact
that
it
didnt
apply
to
gentiles
this
is
a
simple
answer
which
i
think
just
about
everyone
can
agree
to
a
discussion
of
the
issue
in
more
or
less
these
terms
is
recorded
in
acts
however
theres
more
involved
in
order
to
get
a
full
picture
of
the
role
of
the
law
we
have
to
come
to
grips
with
pauls
apparent
rejection
of
the
law
and
how
that
relates
to
jesus
commendation
of
the
law
at
least
as
i
read
paul
he
says
that
the
law
serves
a
purpose
that
has
been
in
a
certain
sense
superceded
again
this
issue
isnt
one
of
the
abolition
of
the
law
in
the
middle
of
his
discussion
paul
notes
that
he
might
be
understood
this
way
and
assures
us
that
thats
not
what
he
intends
to
say
rather
he
sees
the
law
as
primarily
being
present
to
convict
people
of
their
sinfulness
but
ultimately
its
an
impossible
standard
and
one
that
has
been
superceded
by
christ
pauls
comments
are
not
the
worlds
clearest
here
and
not
everyone
agrees
with
my
reading
but
the
interesting
thing
to
notice
is
that
even
this
radical
position
does
not
entail
an
abolition
of
the
law
it
still
remains
as
an
uncompromising
standard
from
which
not
an
iota
or
dot
may
be
removed
for
its
purpose
of
convicting
of
sin
its
important
that
it
not
be
relaxed
however
for
christians
its
not
the
end
ultimately
we
live
in
faith
not
law
while
the
theoretical
categories
they
use
are
rather
different
in
the
end
i
think
jesus
and
paul
come
to
a
rather
similar
conclusion
the
quoted
passage
from
mat
should
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
where
jesus
shows
us
how
he
interprets
the
law
the
not
an
iota
or
dot
would
suggest
a
rather
literal
reading
but
in
fact
thats
not
jesus
approach
jesus
interpretations
emphasize
the
intent
of
the
law
and
stay
away
from
the
ceremonial
details
indeed
he
is
well
known
for
taking
a
rather
free
attitude
towards
the
sabbath
and
kosher
laws
some
scholars
claim
that
mat
needs
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
cent
jewish
discussions
jesus
accuses
his
opponents
of
caring
about
giving
a
tenth
of
even
the
most
minor
herbs
but
neglecting
the
things
that
really
matter
justice
mercy
and
faith
and
caring
about
how
cups
and
plates
are
cleaned
but
not
about
the
fact
that
inside
the
people
who
use
them
are
full
of
extortion
and
rapacity
mat
this
and
the
discussion
later
in
mat
suggest
that
jesus
has
a
very
specific
view
of
the
law
in
mind
and
that
when
he
talks
about
maintaining
the
law
in
its
full
strength
he
is
thinking
of
these
aspects
of
it
pauls
conclusion
is
similar
while
he
talks
about
the
law
being
superceded
all
of
the
specific
examples
he
gives
involve
the
ceremonial
law
such
as
circumcision
and
the
sabbath
he
is
quite
concerned
about
maintaining
moral
standards
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
when
paul
talks
about
the
law
being
superceded
and
jesus
talks
about
the
law
being
maintained
i
believe
they
are
talking
about
different
aspects
of
the
law
paul
is
embroiled
in
arguments
about
circumcision
as
is
natural
in
letters
responding
to
specific
situations
hes
looking
at
the
aspect
of
the
law
that
is
currently
causing
trouble
the
law
as
specifically
jewish
ceremonies
he
certainly
does
not
intend
to
abolish
divine
standards
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand
when
jesus
commends
the
law
he
seems
to
be
talking
the
law
in
its
broadest
implications
for
morals
and
human
relationships
and
deemphasizing
those
aspects
that
were
later
to
give
paul
so
much
trouble
its
unfortunate
that
people
use
the
same
terms
in
different
ways
but
we
should
be
familiar
with
that
from
current
conflicts
look
at
the
way
terms
like
family
values
take
on
special
meaning
from
the
current
context
imagine
some
poor
historian
of
the
future
trying
to
figure
out
why
family
values
should
be
used
as
a
code
word
for
opposition
to
homosexuality
in
one
specific
period
in
the
us
i
think
law
had
taken
on
a
similar
role
in
the
arguments
paul
was
involved
in
paul
was
clearly
not
rejecting
all
of
the
jewish
values
that
go
along
with
the
term
law
any
more
than
people
who
concerned
about
the
family
values
movement
are
really
opposed
to
family
values

i
recall
reading
in
michael
rutherfords
novel
sarum
a
scene
in
which
the
son
of
a
roman
nobleman
living
in
britain
takes
part
in
a
secret
ceremony
involving
a
bull
he
stands
naked
in
a

covered
with
some
sort
of
scaffolding
while
assistants
coax
a
bull
to
stand
on
the

they
then
fatally
stab
the

which
douses

in

with

this
is
supposedly
some
sort
of
rite

for
members
of
the

i
wonder
if
this
is
related
to
the
mithras

yes
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
traditional
ideas
about
the
mithraic
cult
although
not
the
only
one
it
had
many
elements
that
seem
to
have
been
borrowed
by
catholicism
eg
the
mass
communion
the
sharing

consecration

i
read

it
was
nothing

had

much
the

in

antigay
sentimental
literature
gay
people
are
and
will
con
tinue
to
be
persecuted
as
long
as
such
propaganda
petpetuates
you
may
be
unaware
of
all
the
statistica
findings
concerning
africanamericans
that
have
been
published
and
used
by
various
groups
to
reenforce
their
own
bias
against
africanamericans
we
usually
think
of
the
kkk
in
these
instances
but
there
are
many
other
groups
of
course
the
vast
majority
of
the
public
scoff
at
such
findings
and
documents
today
but
that
was
not
always
the
case
fortunately
africanamericans
had
whites
who
supported
their
cause
and
public
sentiment
was
eventually
if
not
entirely
turned
around
there
was
even
a
civil
war
and
antinegro
sentiment
increased
in
fact
until
laws
were
put
in
place
to
protect
the
inalienable
rights
of
blacks
it
was
pretty
much
legal
to
discriminate
against
them
i
know
many
gays
and
i
will
not
turn
my
back
on
them
or
their
right
to
be
free
form
discrimination
you
may
think
that
i
have
been
deceived
or
something
that
is
your
perogative
my
church
christian
church
disciples
of
christ
openly
affirms
the
rights
of
oppressed
people
of
all
segments
of
society
including
gays
we
believe
the
gospel
message
of
preaching
to
all
creation
and
making
disciples
we
believe
in
the
lords
great
commandment
to
love
and
we
beleive
in
standing
up
for
the
oppressed
even
if
it
is
not
popular
to
do
so
i
really
like
my
church
for
last
reason
the
most
i
can
find
a
church
almost
anywhere
in
the
valley
that
stands
for
the
gospel
and
believes
in
the
commandment
of
love
though
im
hardpressed
to
find
many
who
actually
sho
love
but
not
many
are
willing
to
champion
the
oppressed
especially
within
their
own
community
i
may
have
lost
face
with
the
greater
christian
community
for
the
unpopularity
of
my
beliefs
but
so
did
the
abolitionists
against
the
oppression
of
africanamericans
many
were
even
killed
and
treated
as
runaway
slaves
for
being
niggerlovers
and
such
i
guess
ive
decided
the
challenge
is
worth
it
in
my
talks
with
gay
men
and
women
i
have
heard
tragic
story
after
tragic
story
centering
around
failed
marriages
wives
and
husbands
who
are
straight
who
have
been
hurt
in
the
process
etc
funny
thing
is
i
dont
know
of
one
case
where
the
parents
exwives
or
even
children
have
continued
to
reject
their
gay
family
member
son
daughter
exhusband
father
etc
after
they
began
to
take
part
in
some
form
of
support
group
like
pflag
im
apalled
by
the
legislation
which
passed
in
colorado
and
am
equally
raged
that
such
slimey
people
as
louis
sheldon
from
the
tradition
values
coalition
have
been
actively
working
in
the
christian
underground
to
garner
support
within
several
i
believe
states
this
coming
november
for
more
oppressive
legisation
against
gays
perhaps
you
dont
get
it
and
maybe
you
never
will
many
didnt
get
it
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
proclaimed
gods
will
be
done
as
they
massacred
thousands
in
witch
hunts
and
inquisitions
the
message
that
comes
through
loud
and
clear
by
proponents
against
gay
rights
and
against
gays
in
general
is
that
there
is
a
strong
dislike
even
hatred
for
gays
whether
you
want
to
call
it
such
or
not
it
doesnt
change
the
results
the
major
flaw
in
all
this
posturing
is
that
in
the
end
the
final
effect
of
posts
like
that
of
yours
and
mr
hudson
is
that
you
have
a
conditional
love
for
gays
condition
change
and
well
love
you
this
is
sure
strange
coming
from
a
group
who
claim
that
god
has
an
unconditional
love
one
that
calls
people
just
as
they
are
sure
there
are
things
that
will
naturally
change
and
habits
like
alcoholism
wife
beating
etc
that
need
to
be
changed
through
some
sort
of
therapy
but
then
there
are
things
like
lefthandedness
etc
that
no
amount
of
beating
it
out
of
people
is
going
to
result
in
anything
more
than
an
outward
conforminty
to
other
peoples
expectations
in
the
process
this
coerced
conformity
causes
many
people
a
great
deal
of
harm
especially
when
it
is
caused
by
people
who
have
nothing
more
to
gain
from
it
that
to
become
even
more
puffed
up
about
their
own
sense
of
pseuperspirituality
this
is
sad
but
i
thoroughly
believe
that
one
day
it
will
change
it
may
be
unpopular
to
cry
for
justice
and
equality
when
the
basis
has
to
do
with
something
very
personal
like
sexuality
a
taboo
subject
even
today
but
i
firmly
believe
in
the
rights
of
individuals
to
be
free
from
impose
regulation
on
thier
bedrooms
its
funny
that
most
straight
people
have
successfully
removed
restrictive
and
oppressive
legislation
against
invasive
legislation
but
we
like
to
maintain
this
little
chestnut
of
repressionas
though
it
helps
us
maintain
a
sense
of
superiority
over
at
least
one
segment
of
society
gay
people
are
not
criminals
another
interesting
thing
happened
recently
a
very
prominent
charismatic
church
in
the
silicon
valley
here
had
two
of
its
pastors
arrested
for
self
admitted
charges
of
pederasty
men
having
sex
with
boys
this
had
apparently
been
going
on
for
some
time
a
couple
years
but
since
the
charges
were
voluntary
and
the
church
worked
closely
with
the
police
so
i
imagine
that
was
how
they
managed
to
downplay
it
in
the
media
how
could
such
a
thing
happen
when
the
church
itself
has
an
exgay
ministry
one
of
my
friends
recently
told
me
he
was
approached
by
someone
who
is
going
through
the
reparitive
therapy
there
and
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
request
for
dinner
was
not
an
invitation
to
attend
the
ministry
these
are
difficult
times
we
live
in
but
providing
hostile
environments
and
creating
and
perpetuating
an
atmosphere
that
breed
hate
and
violence
is
not
the
call
of
the
christian
community
the
results
of
the
passing
amendment
in
colorado
has
created
an
organization
whos
posters
are
appearing
all
over
colorado
called
straight
i
forget
the
whole
definition
off
hand
but
the
last
part
was
against
immoral
gross
homosexual
trash
and
their
motto
is
working
for
a
fagfree
america
with
an
implicit
advocation
for
violence
this
is
sick
and
it
seems
to
be
what
you
and
mr
hudson
and
others
are
embracing
we
christians
have
a
loooooooooong
tradition
of
coersion
and
oppression
towards
those
we
feel
dont
measure
up
and
constant
beratement
from
organizations
like
the
christian
research
institute
while
they
do
have
a
good
purpose
also
their
major
work
seems
to
be
finding
new
and
better
ways
of
excluding
people
the
gospel
i
believe
is
not
so
negative
rather
it
seeks
ways
to
include
people
i
have
several
of
dr
martins
books
and
find
them
quite
helpful
especially
concerning
cults
but
it
seems
that
cri
has
become
a
cult

obviously

it

be

saying

saying

doesnt

i
endorse

we
christians
have
a
loooooooooong
tradition
of
coersion
and
oppression
towards
those
we
feel
dont
measure
up
and
now
we
have
homosexual
advocates
telling
us
that
if
we
dont
teach
our
kids
that
homosexuality
is
natural
and
a
perfectly
acceptable
alternative
lifestyle
then
they
will
have
it
done
for
us
no
thanks
the
gospel
i
believe
is
not
so
negative
rather
it
seeks
ways
to
include
people
absolutely
and
the
message
is
always
go
and
sin
no
more
not
go
and
do
whatever
feels
good
one
question
at
the
start
of
your
post
you
wrote
i
know
many
gays
and
i
will
not
turn
my
back
on
them
or
their
right
to
be
free
form
discriminationi
may
have
lost
face
with
the
greater
christian
community
for
the
unpopularity
of
my
beliefs
but
so
did
the
abolitionists
against
the
oppression
of
africanamericans
many
were
even
killed
and
treated
as
runaway
slaves
for
being
niggerlovers
and
such
i
guess
ive
decided
the
challenge
is
worth
it
this
sounds
real
nice
but
struck
me
as
a
little
odd
youre
presenting
yourself
as
if
you
were
a
straight
xian
who
is
sticking
his
neck
out
and
taking
on
the
challenge
of
speaking
out
in
support
of
gays
in
the
church
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
yourself
are
gay
thats
all
well
and
fine
but
presenting
yourself
as
sticking
out
your
neck
to
help
repressed
others
seems
a
bit
untruthful
under
the
circumstances

kelvin
i

ive

all
about

in
sunday
school
catechism
class
and
theology
classes
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
maybe
im
still
not
understanding
it
or
maybe
im
just
understanding
it
all
too
well
then
as
you
understand
it
what
is
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
know
that
the
punishment
of
an
innocent
man
is
wrong
yes
i
agree
with
that
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
jesus
punishment
you
say
jesus
did
not
regard
his
death
as
punishment
ive
tried
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
several
years
to
accept
it
but
i
just
cant
good
i
wouldnt
eithernot
the
way
you
understand
it
if
you
can

why
the
death

was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad

and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me
ask
jesus
himself
he
himself
said
why
in
john
it
isnt
a
mystery
to
anyone
and
there
certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the

cannot
accept
him

it
neither

the

the

such

i

that
i
probably

it
is
not

that
mr

willingly

blatant

in

of

inerrancy
and
thus
is
worthless

okay
im

give
us
a
listing
of
blatant
lies
from
encyclopedia
of
biblical
difficulties
or
other
archer

that
would
be
interesting
if
only
a
very
short

can

i
think
it
is
more
likely
that
mr

with
his
inerancy
mindset
is
not
always
impartial
and
made
a
doozy
of
a

imho
i
also
think
that
this

tends
to
generate
these

on
the

hand
if
a

it
is
more
likely
that
mr

intentionally
uses
deception
in

books
why
should
he
be
deceptive
just
with

so
archer
is
just
sitting
around
rubbing
his
hands
and
plotting
how
next
to
deceive
ok
lets
see
the
list
this
was
an
open
question
i
assumed
that
if
mr

is
a
chronic
liar
someone
whould
have
documented
it
this
assumption
is
based
on
how
talkorigins
regulars
have

numerous
cases
of
creationist
deceptions
such
as
duane
guish
and
his

acceptable

i
derive
that

is
there
such
a
thing
as
catholic
erotica
not
necessarily
a

between

of

a
love
story
that
is
not
exploitative
does
not
seek
redemption
through

pays
proper

with

taking

when
he
shall
come

and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
kinda
gives
flaming
a
whole
new
meaning
i
reckon
the
impression
i
got
from
talking
with
livingston
was
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
powerwise
is
going
to
be
something
that
those
who
are
unprepared
cant
handle
kinda
like
overloading
a
fuse
due
to
guilt
somehow
it
seems
to
also
apply
to
the
entire
physical
world
as
we
know
it
lf
suggests
that
god
doesnt
want
that
and
has
sent
koresh
as
a
reminder
seems
that
those
who
have
been
purified
through
salvation
or
that
those
protected
by
the
seals
will
be
the
ones
who
survive
and
no
i
dont
have
a
good
idea
yet
what
being
shielded
by
the
seals
actually
involves
or
how
exactly
it
relates
to
salvation
other
than
it
involves
the
marriage
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
for
those
of
you
biblical
well
versed
me
personally
im
totally
dependent
on
god
through
christ
so
if
god
wants
me
to
understand
good
if
not
also
good
if
god
wants
to
save
me
or
dispose
of
me
thats
great
either
way
being
born
in
the
spirit
means
being
part
of
the
body
of
christ
ephesians
so
who
and
what
i
was
matters
little
whats

is
loving

come

who
cares
satan
might

a
pretty

fake
big
deal
not
worth
fearing

about
though
not

the
greater
glory

maybe
koresh
is
right
maybe
he
isnt

it
should
be
interesting
to
see
the
new

the
tour
of
the

ive
taken

the
passages
he

has

the

is
still
the
fruit
it
bears
which
is
not
yet
clear
much
much
more
important
is
charity
which
by
definition
is
love
for
god
i
hope
dear

youve
taken
all

it

because
other

now
that
is
just
my
opinion
dont
confuse
the
claim
objective

exists
with
the
claim
i
have
a
lock
on

i
think
that
at
this

it
would
actually
be
quite
easy
to
confuse
objective
morality
with
relative
morality
jon
actually
jon
that
is
quite
true
christian
people
have
caused
objective
morality
to
look
very
relative
after
all
that
was
the
point
of
the
original
question
in
this
thread
ie
can
we
toss
out
christianity
because
it
is
so
obviously
inconsistent
with
its
own
principles
if
you
will
bear
with
me
i
will
attempt
to
explain
this
apparent
inconsistency
from
at
least
one
christians
viewpoint
if
god
exists
and
is
the
creator
of
mankind
as
the
bible
claims
then
he
has
a
pretty
welldefined
concept
of
what
makes
people
tick
physically
emotionally
etc
god
has
an
objective
morality
for
us
that
is
to
say
he
has
no
trouble
understanding
what
is
good
for
or
detrimental
to
the
creature
he
created
galatians
for
we
mankind
are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
for
good
works
a
morality
which
god
prepared
beforehand
a
welldefined
design
that
we
might
walk
in

contrary

morality
cannot

to

volumes

objective
morality
for

throughout

mankind
has
tried
to
reduce
morality
to
a

rules
objectivity
if
you
please
in
the
old
testament
we
have
both
principles
and
specific
rules
by
the
time
of
jesus
most
of
the
principles
were
obscured
by
the
emphasis
men
had
placed
on
the
rules
volumes
of
additional
rules
had
been
made
to
try
to
codify
the
application
of
the
principles
we
mankind
werent
comfortable
with
the
subjectivity
of
principles
for
reference
see
matthew
where
jesus
explains
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
principles
of
the
law
for
example
in
verses
you
have
heard
that
the
ancients
were
told
you
shall
not
commit
murderand
whoever
commits
murder
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
but
i
say
to
you
that
everyone
who
is
angry
with
his
brother
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
the
objective
morality
of
god
gets
blurred
by
our
inept
interpretation
of
it
we
christians
have
made
our
biggest
errors
when
we
have
allowed
any
one
person
or
group
of
people
decide
exactly
what
god
intended
for
us
if
we
christians
would
stay
committed
to
seeking
gods
will
instead
of
trying
to
prove
we
already
had
it
all
figured
out
we
might
do
a
better
job
of
allowing
others
to
find
gods
objective
morality
for
themselves
if
jesus
is
who
he
said
he
wasis
and
thats
the
fundamental
question
then
he
is
objective
morality

russel

are
under
no

of
my
legislating

own
understanding

love
if
i
take
him
at
his
word
he
cannot
condemn
the
inquisitors
because
they
were
also
following
these
commandments
as
they
understood
them
if
you
misread
i
can
do
and
have
repeatedly
done
a
complete
bill
of
accusation
against
the
inquisition
by
exhibiting
in
as
thorough
a
form
as
anyone
might
want
a
demonstration
of
the
harm
it
has
done
to
human
beings
in
the
first
place
and
to
respect
for
let
alone
love
of
god
in
near
succession
please
go
back
to
my
quoted
words
above
the
possibility
that
always
exists
is
that
i
or
to
revert
to
proper
time
sequence
my
predecessors
over
the
last
several
centuries
could
persuade
christian
b
of
my
case
that
the
inquisition
does
indeed
constitute
an
egregious
violation
of
the
law
of
love
i
must
also
note
that
the
majority
of
christians
have
been
so
persuaded
by
christian
argumentation
as
well
as
by
secular
both
christian
and
nonchristian
prohibitions
what
mr
turpin
alludes
to
is
a
trickier
point
a
i
demonstrate
the
human
pain
and
violation
of
love
involved
in
the
inquisition
b
the
inquisitor
responds
that
mother
church
must
however
painful
this
seems
discipline
her
children
for
their
own
good
in
this
case
the
salvation
of
their
souls
or
if
the
tortured
heretic
will
not
recant
than
by
bad
example
deterring
others
from
the
same
lossofsoul
a
i
point
out
that
this
justification
of
a
failure
in
love
depends
on
a
highly
speculative
construal
of
texts
and
of
philosophical
assertions
that
are
quite
undemonstrable
b
burns
me
at
the
stake
my
rhetoric
has
failed
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
sustained
what
is
going
on
here
has
a
lot
to
do
with
cultural
baggage
in
this
case
the
baggage
includes
a
nearly
universal
and
absolutely
secular
belief
that
an
accused
person
must
prove
innocence
and
that
testimony
is
most
believable
if
taken
under
torture
the
elimination
of
inqisitorial
practice
in
those
places
where
it
has
been
eliminated
or
at
least
greatly
reduced
has
very
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
discussion
of
sin
in
the
exchange
between
a
and
b
mr
turpin
is
pointing
out
that
if
i
am
a
versus
the
grand
inquisitors
b
then
my
persuasion
is
not
very
likely
to
work
i
know
this
and
in
what
ever
personal
agony
i
consign
the
issue
to
god
and
my
ghostly
defense
attorney
so
one
possibility
fails
in
this
case
as
it
will
fail
in
may
others
at
the
other
extreme
the
persuasion
will
succeed
when
it
properly
should
not
if
it
entails
mistaken
assumptions
i
share
with
the
inquisitor
and
that
is
potentially
an
even
more
troubling
case
in
that
many
of
the
victims
of
inquisition
will
have
accepted
that
they
were
in
fact
sinful
in
such
random
cases
as
they
may
actually
have
been
guilty
of
charges
brought
against
them
the
point
is
that
the
persuasion
breaks
down
when
the
parties
do
not
share
enough
to
agree
on
all
the
cultural
baggage
and
given
the
main
thrust
of
the
inquisition
against
heresy
it
is
bound
to
break
down
in
precisely
the
worst
cases
the
conservative
i
dont
think
that
is
the
right
word
btw
will
take
refuge
in
what
i
attribute
to
b
above
that
he
is
justified
in
causing
harm
because
he
thinks
that
works
to
a
greater
good
but
this
is
a
violent
and
extravagant
refusal
to
follow
the
gospel
as
if
ones
theories
about
sin
entitled
one
to
cast
aside
jesus
words
on
dealing
with
sinners
cf
matthew
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
seriously
or
for
that
matter
what
does
it
mean
to
love
ones
fellow
man
and
what
is
the
right
thing
and
how
does
one
go
about
loving
god
well
the
whole
point
of
making
these
the
base
commandments
is
that
they
arent
reducible
to
rules
a
set
of
rules
is
a
moral
code
or
a
law
code
or
an
algorithm
for
acting
such
things
can
be
very
helpful
to
individuals
or
societies
but
not
if
they
are
used
instead
of
a
personal
involvement
in
and
responsibility
for
ones
actions
the
great
commandment
is
more
than
anything
else
a
call
to
act
as
if
you
were
god
and
accepting
ultimate
responsibility
in
your
every
action
a
demand
that
i
like
most
would
rather
not
hear
but
it
keeps
popping
up
nonetheless
along
with
the
reassurance
that
it
is
more
important
that
i
be
open
to
trying
this
than
succeeding
at
it
conservatives
may
twist
this
act
as
if
you
were
god
to
mean
lay
down
rules
for
other
people
and
be
as
nasty
to
them
as
possible
if
they
dont
keep
your
rules
they
are
so
insistent
and
obvious
about
this
that
they
have
convinced
a
lot
of
people
who
rightly
reject
the
whole
concept
that
such
idiocy
is
how
god
acts
that
after
all
is
the
standard
accusation
against
god
by
the
atheists
here
and
elsewhere
that
the
conservatives
have
confused
their
manipulative
hoopjumping
notions
of
coercing
other
people
with
the
nature
of
god
is
almost
the
entire
content
of
standard
american
atheism
and
i
quite
agree
with
it
on
this
point
ethical
systems
are
not
differentiated
by
the
nice
sounding
goo
up
front
much
of
which
sounds
pretty
much
the
same
but
by
the
specific
acts
procedures
and
arguments
that
they
recommend
and
different
bodies
of
christians
have
from
the
beginning
urged
different
ethical
systems
or
in
some
cases
none
as
a
result
it
is
bizarre
to
identify
any
one
of
these
systems
however
popular
or
infamous
with
christianity
christianity
does
not
have
a
torah
it
does
not
have
a
quran
specifically
christian
scripture
has
very
little
if
anything
in
the
way
of
commandments
so
little
that
the
christians
who
desperately
want
commandments
go
mining
for
them
with
almost
no
support
and
thus
almost
no
obvious
limitation
for
their
efforts
the
one
single
thing
in
the
gospels
which
jesus
specifically
gives
as
a
commandment
to
us
is
love
one
another
i
will
be
expanding
on
this
point
in
a
reply
to
paul
hudson
that
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
day
or
so
it
is
quite
true
that
some
christians
infer
lots
of
commandments
from
the
nt
ill
point
out
what
has
to
be
going
on
in
these
inferences
and
why
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
cultural
baggage
involved
you
are
quite
right
that
this
is
goo
if
one
is
looking
for
an
ethical
system
but
why
should
anyone
be
looking
for
an
ethical
system
since
our
society
is
eager
to
hand
us
one
or
more
no
matter
what
we
do
it
may
be
that
we
need
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
in
which
case
i
will
profer
the
agapate
allelou
once
again
i
am
glad
that
a
few
christians
such
as
michael
find
a
benign
meaning
for
the
goo
and
then
interpret
the
usually
ugly
specifics
in
a
more
constructive
fashion
on
the
other
hand
i
do
think
that
this
tells
us
more
about
michael
and
christians
like
him
that
it
tells
us
about
christianity
i
think
you
are
begging
the
question
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
tell
you
something
about
christianity
nor
is

i
read

noticed

the

knew
virtually
nothing

science
i
asked
church
members
some
questions
about
theories
from
the
phamphlet
and
got
only
deceptive
answers
i
began
to
notice
a
very
similar
style
of
answers
for
theological
questions
as
well
the
only
conclusion
i
could
reach
was
that
these
peoples
beliefs
about

were
about
as
valid
as
their
beliefs
in

your

many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
ra
your
point
that
we
all
are
brothers
of
jesus
and
lucifer
is
also
ra
heretical
since
we
are
not
innately
brothers
and
sisters
of
christ
ra
we
are
adopted
for
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
ra
again
to
fear
but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
ra
we
cry
abba
father
romans
and
not
the
natural
children
ra
of
god
it
is
only
through
faith
that
we
even
enter
the
family
of
ra
god
for
ye
are
all
the
children
of
god
by
faith
in
christ
jesus
ra
galatians
and
it
is
only
through
the
manifestation
of
this
ra
faith
in
receiving
jesus
that
we
are
become
the
sons
of
god
but
ra
as
many
as
received
him
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
ra
god
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
which
were
born
not
ra
of
blood
nor
of
the
will
of
the
flesh
nor
of
the
will
of
man
but
ra
of
god
john
ra
ra
has
it
occured
to
you
robert
that
being
born
of
someone
or
being
ra
of
that
person
or
persons
family
may
be
a
symbolic
term
in
the
new
ra
testament
mormons
believe
that
we
are
adopted
into
the
house
of
ra
israel
through
baptism
and
faith
in
christ
although
some
have
expressed
ra
belief
that
this
does
evince
a
physical
change
in
our
bodies
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
matthew
i
speak
that
which
i
have
seen
with
my
father
and
ye
do
that
which
ye
have
seen
with
your
father
john
ye
do
the
deeds
of
your
father
then
said
they
to
him
we
be
not
born
of
fornication
we
have
one
father
even
god
jesus
said
unto
them
if
god
were
your
father
ye
would
love
me
for
i
proceeded
forth
and
came
from
god
neither
came
i
of
myself
but
he
sent
me
why
do
ye
not
understand
my
speech
even
because
ye
cannot
hear
my
word
ye
are
of
your
father
the
devil
and
the
lusts
of
your
father
ye
will
do
he
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
and
abode
not
in
the
truth
because
there
is
no
truth
in
him
when
he
speaketh
a
lie
he
speaketh
of
his
own
for
he
is
a
liar
and
the
father
of
it
john
and
said
o

of
all
subtilty

all
mischief

worketh

ephesians
in
this
the
children
of

are
manifest
and
the
children
of

whosoever
doeth
not
righteousness
is
not
of

neither
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
john
one
becomes
a
child
of

as
many
as

him
to
them
gave
he
power
to

even
to
them
that
believe
on
his

john
behold
what
manner
of
love
the
father
hath
bestowed
upon
us
that
we
should
be
called
the
sons
of

therefore
the
world
knoweth
us
not
because
it
knew
him
not
beloved
now
are
we
the
sons
of
god
and
it
doth
not
yet
appear
what
we
shall
be
but
we
know
that
when
he
shall
appear
we
shall
be
like
him
for
we
shall
see
him
as
he
is
john
when
he
is

christ
which
were
born
not
of

nor
of
the

the

and

christ

is
to

the
only
true
god
yet
the
ra
doctrines
of
the

that
i
have

portray
a
vastly
ra
different
jesus
a
jesus
that
cannot
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
of
ra
the
bible
they
are
so
far
removed
from
each
other
that
to
proclaim
ra
one
as
being
true
denies
the
other
from
being
true
according
to
the
ra
bible
eternal
life
is
dependent
on
knowing
the
only
true
god
and
ra
not
the
construct

ra
ra
ra
robert
with
all
due
respect
who
died
and
left
you
chief
arbiter
of
ra
correct
biblical
interpretation
i
dont
mean
to
be
snotty
about
this
ra
but
the
fact
is
that
the
bible
is
so
differently
interpreted
by
different
ra
groups
of
biblical
scholars
what
do
you
think
of
the
jehovahs
ra
witnesses
for
example
that
to
make
reference
to
the
jesus
of
the
ra
bible
is
simply
ridiculous
whose
jesus
of
the
bible
do
you
mean
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
for
example
the
fact
that
the
jehovahs
witnesses
deny
the
deity
of
christ
does
not
alter
what
the
bible
teaches
looking
for
that
blessed
hope
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
titus
peter
a
servant
and
an
apostle
of
jesus
christ
to
them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
righteousness
of
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
peter
on
the
deity
of
christ
we
first
look
to
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
to
discount
or
not
even
address
what
the
bible
teaches
because
there
are
some
groups
that
have
differing
views
is
selfdefeating
to
see
what
the

teaches
you
have
to
look
at
the
bible
ra
our
lords
mortality
was
essential
to
his
own
salvation
the
ra
promised
messiah
p
he
had

not

have

may
seem

im

to
accept
that
i
find
this
rather
curious
when
i
mentioned
that
the
mormon
belief
is
that
jesus
needed
to
be
saved
i
put
forward
some
quotes
from
the
late
apostle
bruce
mcconkie
the
curious
part
is
that
no
one
addressed
the
issue
of
jesus
needing
to
be
saved
rick
comes
the
closest
with
his
i
have
my
own
conclusions
to
addressing
the
point
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were

that
is
not
the

arjuna
as
a
student

friend
of
lord
krsna
is
advised
to
raise
himself
to
the
transcendental
position
of
vedanta
philosophy
where
in

beginning
there
is
brahmajijnasa
or
questions
on
the
supreme
transcendence
all
the
living

who
are
in

are
struggling
very

for

for
them
the
lord
after
creation
of
the
material

gave
the
vedic
wisdom
advising
how
to
live
and
get
rid
of
the
material
entanglement
when
the
activities
for
sense
gratification
namely
the

chapter
are

then
the
chance
for
spiritual
realization
is
offered
in
the
form
of
the
upanisads
which
are
part
of
different
vedas
as
the
bhagavadgita
is
a
part
of
the
fifth
veda
namely
the
mahabharata
the
upanisads
mark
the
beginning
of
transcendental
life
as
long
as
the
material
body
exists
there
are
actions
and
reactions
in
the
material
modes
one
has
to
learn
tolerance
in
the
face
of
dualities
such
as
happiness
and
distress
or
cold
and
warmth
and
by
tolerating
such
dualities
become
free
from
anxieties
regarding
gain
and
loss
this
transcendental
position
is
achieved
in
full
krsna
consciousness

is

would
you
consider
the

of
an

peter
to
testify
to
the
events
surrounding
jesus
life
we
did
not
follow
cleverly
invented
stories
when
we
told
you
about
the
power
and
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
but
we
were
eyewitnesses
of
his
majesty
for
he
received
honor
and
glory
from
god
the
father
when
the
voice
came
to
him
from
the
majestic
glory
saying
this
is
my
son
whom
i
love
with
him
i
am
well
pleasedÞ
we
ourselves
heard
this
voice
that
came
from
heaven
when
we
were
with
him
on
the
sacred
mountain
and
we
have
the
word
of
the

made
more
certain
and
you
will
do
well
to
pay
attention
to
it
as
to
a
light
shining
in
a
dark
place
until
the
day
dawns
and
the
morning
star
rises
in
your
hearts
this
is
a
documented
testimony
perhaps
further
research
on
your
part
is
warranted
before
making
more
statements
there
is
considerably
more
to
study
in
peters
two
books
of

we
have

that
put

killing
most
of
the

inside
i
would
hardly
consider
the

to
be
christian
they
were
acting
in
direct

jesus
second

is
something

everyone

also
predicted

messiahs
who
will

his

im
not

annoyed
about
the

they
knew
supposedly
what
they
were
doing
and
its
their
own
actions
what
i
mostly
are
angry
about
is
the
fact
that
the
people
inside
including
mothers
let
the
children
suffer
and
die
during
awful
conditions
i
agree
with
you
there
if
this
is
considered
religious
following
to
the
end
im
proud
that
i
dont
follow
such
fanatical
and
noncompassionate
religions
me
too
i
have
already

my

god
tells
me

lay
down
my

it
will
be
to
save
another

might
want
to
die
for
whatever
purpose

please
spare
the
innocent
young
ones
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
all
i
have
a

christians
do
you

would

do
you
judge
all
christians
by
the
acts
of
those
who
would
call
themselves
christian
and
yet
are
not
the
bds
contradicted
scripture
in
their
actions
they
were
not
christian
simple
as
that
perhaps
you
have
read
too
much
into
what
the
media
has
portrayed
ask
any
truebelieving
christian
and
you
will
find
that
they
will
deny
any
association
with
the
bds
even
the
day
adventists
have
denied
any
further
ties
with
this
cult

was

you

if

eventually

him
i
bear

no

if
anything
i
feel
pity
for

jesus
had
to
die
to
pay
the
price
for
our
sins
and
so
the
jews
were
merely
fulfilling
prophesy
jesus
knew
he
had
to
die
even
before
he
began
his
ministry
that
demonstrates
the
great
depth

jesus
certainly
demonstrated

made

what

tradgedy
dont

though
the

davidians
were

they

biblical
backing

i
dont

anyone
really
cares

ive

its
pretty
good
if
not
inspired
though
i
differ
in
part
on
some
of
his
conclusions
the
argument
he
presents
is
well
backed
which
is
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
work
through
still
ongoing
if
you
thought
it
was
rambling
that
says
far
more
about
you
than

definite
relationship
between
the
youve
made
me
curious
what
does
this
say
about
me
first
seal
in
revelation
the
entirety
of
psalms
and
the
most
of
revelation
which
demonstrated
one
of
his
major
points
about
how
the
writings
in
the
prophets
including
david
and
in
the
psalms
and
in
revelation
are
all
telling
the
same
story
when
you
understand
how
theyre
related
ie
have
the
key
the
largely
explain
each
other
charles
manson
used
revelation
as
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
of
koresh
liked
the
beatles
the
sequence
following
is
keyed
to
the
koresh
tape
should
you
care
to
check
it
out
you
can
almost
see
the
note
cards
he
used
when
doing
the
analysis
long
list
of
biblical
references
which
impressed
me
tremendously
but
were
deleted
in
the
interests
of
common
sense
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
just
because
he
found
ways
for
the
bible
to
backup
his
rantings
does
not
make
him
any
less
of
a
kook
seems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
for
the
message
he
carried
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself

the

time
we

learned
a
lot

corruption
are

can
you
please
point
to
something
anything
that
proves
to
me
that
the
universe
cannot
possibly
be
explained
without
accepting
as
a
fact
the
existence
of
a
god
in
precisely
the
way
your
holy
book
describes
can
you
please
convince
me
that
your
religion
is
more
than
a
very
cleverlyconstructed
fable
and
that
it
does
indeed
have
some
bearing
on
my
own
personal
daytoday
life
would
you
consider
the
word
of
an
eyewitness
peter
to
testify
to
the
events
surrounding
jesus
life
no
there
are
two
problems
here
peter
died
two
millenia
ago
the
original
letters
he
wrote
have
long
since
decayed
into
dust
if
he
were
alive
today
and
i
could
question
him
then
this
might
lend
credibility
to
your
claims
but
probably
not
much
because
after
all
ive
heard
people
claim
with
all
sincerity
that
theyve
spoken
with
elvis
recently
but
after
his
death
peters
writings
were
transcribed
by
monks
for
centuries
and
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
one
of
them
somewhere
didnt
decide
to
change
the
wording
of
something
to
make
it
in
his
opinion
a
little
easier
to
understand
even
if
peter
did
witness
the
miracles
of
jesus
two
millenia
ago
that
doesnt
mean
that
your
deity
is
what
the
bible
says
it
is
god
might
just
be
satan
trying
to
convince
everyone
that
hes
a
nice
guy
or
even
that
your
deity
is
still
alive
and
active
in
the
world
today
nice
try
but
it
just
isnt
enough
to
convince
me
especially
since
your
wild
claims
about
your
deity
seem
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
way
ive
observed
the
world
to
work
please
find
something
more
compelling

sometimes
it

will

after

by

of
the

they

see
the

how
to

also
they

under

was
incredibly
yukky
and
that
life
with
the
light
of
the

is
great
so
great
that
they
will
want
to
tell
all
their
friends
about
it
and
i
maintain
some
people
do
not
want
to
enter
into
the
light
and
the
knowledge
that
they
alone
are
their
own
masters
because
they
fear
it
they
are
too
afraid
of
having
to
face
the
world
on
their

so
by
their

after

now
that

can
see
things
for
what
they
really
are
they
will
also
see
the
heights
which
they
can
reach
and
the
places
they
can
go

they
will
learn
to
choose
their

paths
through
the

will
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
revel
in
their

do
you
see
my
point
i
think
youre
the
one
under
the
rock
and
im
getting
a
great
tan
out
here
in
the
sunlight
my
life
has
improved
immesurably
since
i
abandoned
theism
come
and
join
me
it
will
be
a
difficult
trip
at
first
until
you
build
up
your
muscles
for
the
long
hike
but
its
well
worth
it
not
all
people
hate

kent
we
all
have
an
adversion
to
it
to
some
extent
but
brian
kendig
who
has
been
replying
to
this
thread
certainly
likes
darkness
brian
k
enjoys
stating
false
concepts
and
false
pressumptions
about
the
god
of
the
bible
without
checking
his
own
presumptions
he
compares
my
god
with
odin
or
zeus
look
you
just
practically
equated
odin
and
zeus
theyre
as
much
different
as
your
god
is
from
them
dont
you
see
im
not
going
to
accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my
own
eyes
or
experience
with
my
own
senses
especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
withough
checking
his
own
presumption
he
thinks
hell
is
the
equivalent
of
nonexistence
when
did
i
say
that
i
say
that
i
would
rather
cease
existing
instead
of
being
subject
to
the
whims
of
a
deity
but
that
if
the
deity
decided
to
toss
me
into
the
fiery
pits
because
of
who
i
am
then
so
be
it
do
you
enjoy
darkness
most
people
will
honestly
admit
yes
most
people
are
fond
of
their
sexual
sins
their
hording
of
money
their
selfishness
and
not
to
mention
their
biblical
ignorance
nope
most
people
are
christian
most
people
are
fond
of
feeling
that
they
are
imperfect
of
believing
that
the
world
is
an
undesirable
place
of
reciting
magical
mystical
prayers
to
make
the
world
nice
and
holy
again
of
doing
just
as
their
priests
tell
them
like
good
little
sheep
you
enjoy
darkness
and
youre
proud
of
it
you
may
know
the
bible
well
but
have
you
read
any
of
the
koran
or
zen
writings
or
hare
krishna
literature
if
you
havent
then
how
can
you
say
you
have
an
open
mind
sin
is
fun
lets
admit
it
but
a
life
of
sin
leads
to
trouble
and
death
in
this
life
and
hell
in
the
next
nope
you
make
decisions
enjoy
your
successes
and
accept
your
failures
then
you
die
if
you
are
content
with
the
life
youve
led
as
you
reflect
back
on
it
in
your
final
moments
then
youve
led
a
good
life
come
out
from
under
the
rock
please
do
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
one
and
only
son
that
whoever
believes
in
him
shall
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
forget
the
bible
for
a
minute
forget
quoting
verses
forget
about
who
said
what
about
this
or
that
show
me
picture
just
you
and
me
and
a
wide
open
hilltop
and
convince
me
that
youre

dr

comments
on
esam
abdelrahems
statement
but
the
problem
is
we
consider
ourself
to
be
muslims
even
though
you
dont
luckily
faith
is
determined
by
what
one
believes
and
is
a
personal

you
cannot

someone

mr

then
comments
on
tahir
ijazs

you
are
not

the

the
converse
would
be
that
the
problem
is
that
muslims
dont

ahmadies
to
be

who
one
considers

cobeliever
is
also
a
personal
matter
it
would
be
just
as
wrong
to
tell
the
muslims
who
should
be
included
in
their
selfdefination
the
argument
by
jawad
ali
is
funny
he
writes
the
converse
would
be
that
the
problem
is
that
muslims
dont
consider
ahmadies
to
be
muslims
which
is
a
wrong
statement
in
the
light
of
dr
ijazs
statement
the
above
statement
should
be
corrected
is
that
some
nonahmadi
muslims
dont
consider
ahmadimuslims
as
muslims
so
the
problem
does
not
get
solved
who
is
a
muslims
and
who
is
not
humans
cannot
decide
humans
may
not
declare
others
faiths
its
that
simple
i
dont
understand
why
the
mere
use
of
the
word
islam
is
becomming
such
a
big
issue
i
have

and
all

no
no
you

i

argument

your

its
true

which
may

i
have
responded
to
both
you

frank
decenso
a
fundieinerrantist
both
you
and
frank
have
taken
quotes
out

and
ive
objected

both
of
you
doing
so
ive
criticized
bad
arguments
both
when
they
were
yours
and
i
agreed
with
the
conclusion
that
the
bible
is
not
inerrant
and
when
they
were
franks
and
i
disagreed
with
the
conclusion
ive
criticized
both
you
and
frank
for
evading
questions
and
for
trying
to
explain
me
away
without
addressing
the
objections
i
raise
you
by
accusing
me
of
being
hypocritical
and
irrational
frank
by

it
is
not
my

you
that
is
the
job
of
the

and
i
frankly
make
a
lousy
one
i
am
only
here
to
testify
your
conversion
is
between
you
and
god
i
am
out
of
the
loop
if
you
decide
to
follow
jesus
of
which
i
indeed
would
be
estatic
then
all
the
glory
be
to
god
ive
asked
your
god
several
times
with
all
my
heart
to
come
to
me
i
really
wish
i
could
believe
in
him
cos
no
matter
how
much
confidence
i
build
up
on
my
own
the
universe
is
a
big
place
and
it
would
be
so
nice
to
know
i
have
someone
watching
over
me
in
it
ive
gone
into
this
with
an
open
mind
ive
layed
my
beliefs
aside
from
time
to
time
when
ive
had
doubt
and
ive
prayed
to
see
what
good
that
would
do
i
dont
see
what
more
i
can
do
to
open
myself
to
your
god
short
of
just
deciding
to
believe
for
no
good
reason
and
if
i
decide
to
believe
for
no
good
reason
why
not
believe
in
some
other
god
zeus
seems
like
a
pretty
cool
candidate
all
i
know
is
that
in
all
my
searching
even
though
ive
set
aside
my
pride
and
decided
that
i
want
to
know
the
truth
no
matter
how
difficult
it
may
be
to
accept
i
have
never
had
any
encounter
with
any
deity
christian
or
otherwise
please
tell
me
what
more
i
can
do
while
still
remaining
true

it

that

jesus
christ
never
commanded
toleration
as
a
motive
for
his
disciples
and
toleration
is
the
antithesis
of
the
christian
message
page
the
central
dynamic
of
the
freemason
drive
for
world
unity
through
fraternity
liberty
and

is
toleration
this
is
seen
in
the
writings
of
the
great
writers
of

he
jesus

established
the
most
sectarian
of

possible

there
is
no

what
seems

right

many
churches

each

you
seem
to
be
saying
that
god
being
unknowable
his
morality
is
unknowable
yep
thats
pretty
much
it
as
i
understand
it
the
sadducees
believed
that
the
torah
was
all
that
was
required
whereas
the
pharisees
the
ancestors
of
modern
judaism
believed
that
the
torah
was
available
for
interpretation
to
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
required
morality
in
all
its
nuances
talmud
the
essence
of
all
of
this
is
that
biblical
morality
is
an
interface
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
anything
about
yhwh
outside
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
speculate
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
we
only
really
have
the
bible
to
interpret
and
that
interpretation
is
by
humanity
i
guess
this
is
where
faith
or
relevation
comes
in
with
all
its
inherent
subjectiveness
god
being
unknowable
i
cant
comment
on
his
motives
but
it
would
be
distressing
if
he
allowed
us
to
misunderstand
him
through
no
fault
of
our
own
for
sanitys
sake
we
must
assume
if
we
believe
in
him
at
all
that
his
message
comes
through
somehow
the
question
is
whether
it
comes
through
immediately
to
every
individual
or
is
contained
in
a
complex
canon
that
must
be
interpreted
by
experts
in
consultation
with
one
another
or
is
transmitted
directly
through
appointed
representatives
who
are
free
to
interpret
extend
and
modify
the
canon
if
gods
message
is
indeed
mediated
the
further
problem
arises
as
to
whether
the
individual
under
stands
the
mediated
message
fully
and
clearly
since
the
responsibility
for
understanding
lies
ultimately
with
the
individual
we
must
assume
that
god
in
his
benevolence
guides
each
individual
to
the
appropriate
source
for
that
individual
whereof
the
person
may
or
may
not
drink
metaphysically
if
there
are
multiple
moral
codes
then
there
is
no
absolute
moral
code
and
i
think
this
is
theologically
questionable
no
there
may
be
an
absolute
moral
code
there
are
undoubtably
multiple
moral
codes
the
multiple
moral
codes
may
be
founded
in
the
absolute
moral
code
as
an
example
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assume
that
the
parent
never
swears
simply
because
the
parent
has
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
children
the
wrongness
here
is
if
the
child
disobeys
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
swear
in
front
of
children
but
may
be
quite
happy
to
swear
in
front
of
animals
the
analogy
does
not
quite
hold
water
because
the
child
knows
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
as
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incidentally
the
young
child
considers
the
directive
as
absolute
until
he
gets
older
see
piaget
and
learns
a
morality
of
his
own
your
example
is
complicated
in
our
age
by
the
thin
line
between
morality
and
politeness
you
might
have
said
burp
for
burping
and
swearing
carry
about
the
same
stigma
today
if
you
are
talking
about
taking
the
lords
name
in
vain
as
a
serious
transgression
then
this
example
is
more
a
case
of
hypocrisy
than
of
varying
moral
codes
if
there
is
an
absolute
moral
code
propositions
or
laws
in
that
code
apply
absolutely
and
universally
by
definition
conceivably
some
moral
codes
could
be
subsets
of
the
universal
code
as
you
say
at
the
outset
so
for
example
gods
code
could
include
thou
shalt
not
create
beings
without
a
hospitable
planet
to
live
on
but
this
law
would
be
inapplicable
to
us
nevertheless
we
would
be
entitled
to
suppose
that
all
laws
applicable
to
us
are
also
applicable
to
god
but
when
you
begin
to
ask
what
laws
might
appear
in
gods
moral
code
you
have
a
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
question
does
god
make
laws
for
himself
to
follow
perhaps
god
is
not
the
sort
of
being
to
which
the
category
morality
can
be
sensibly
applied

mr

the

tragedy
of

should
remind
those
who
join
cults
of
the
dangers
of
doing
so
now
i

scratching

a

sign
dont
the

religions
in
this

christianityor
the

adventist
in

just
keep
these
guys
going
isnt
mr
clinton
condemning
his
own
religion
after
all
isnt
it
a
cult
too
a
good
point
what
helps
to
keep
such
things
going
is
the
public
attitude
that
one
should
have
faith
that
some
authority
from
on
high
should
not
be
subjected
to
mere
reason
couple
this
with
a
variety
of
personality
quirks
mojor
and
minor
mental

believe

attempting

replacing

with

is
a

way
to
loose
a

completely

this
is
the
greatest
reason
i
see
that
these

are
not

they
only
seek

there
is
no

christ
did
he
guided

he
didnt

you

christianity

i

with

i
know

consider
your

merlyn
you
know
your

what
would
you
think
of
me
if
i
asserted
that
your
mother
is
feet
tall
murdered
your
father
and
sexually
abused
you
when
you
were
a
kid
would
you
who
knows
your
mother
well
think
was
a
blind
arrogant
idiot
to
proclaim
such
things
merlyn
leroy
says
this
analogy
is
not
good
for
example
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
know
god
as
well
as
you
do
but
dont
agree
on
things
like
how
many
children
heshe
has
whether
heshe
approves
of
polygamy
whether
mohammed
was
one
of
hisher
prophets
now
if
you
and
all
these
other
people
who
absolutely
know
what
god
is
like
cant
agree
on
basic
attributes
like
these
at
least
one
of
you
who
knows
what
this
godthing
is

must
be
wrong
therefore
subjective
certainty
is
worthless
regarding
knowledge
of
this

on
the

i
dont
know
any
large
groups
of
people
who
claim
absolute
knowledge
of
my
mother
and
who
disagree
about
her
basic
attributes
this
is
the
difference
between
real
people
and
imaginary
friends
meryln
therefore
by
your
logic
since
your
people
disagree
about
the
characteristics

i

it

very
contrary
to
the
american
nra
ethos

the
right

christians
should
rely

the
strength

god
to

them
note
that
i

should
we
are
inherently
insecure
but
i
feel
that
that
is
not
proper
justification
to
be
armed
to
the
teeth
a
christian
should
not

to

a

should
rely

his

i

the

say

there

i
in

am
not

i
need
help
jesus
promised
me
this
help
and
i
took
him
up
on
his

i
have
willfully
let
jesus
be
my

because
jesus
knows
what
is
better

than
i
myself
do

why
not

my

will
be
a

trip
at
first
until
you
build
up
your

its
well
worth
it

i

for
you

brian
you

dont
you

im

that
i

witness
with

or
experience
with
my
own

especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
can
you
witness
motherly
love
with
your

how
does
caring

concern

you
register
with
your

if
nothing
registers

other
than
what
you
can

taste

then
you
better
become

and
fast
you
better
get

i
do
have
a
good
reason

what
i
do
when
did
i
say
that
i
say
that
i
would
rather
cease
existing
instead
of
being
subject

the
whims
of
a
deity
but
that
if
the
deity
decided
to
toss
me
into
the
fiery
pits

i

so
be

my

says
that
you
will
not

you
have

forever
you
can
choose
to
either
live
it
in
hell
in
eternal
torment
where
there
is
no
communication
whatsoever
or
can
choose
to
live
it
in
paradise
with
god
that
is
what
my
god
says
and
that
was
the
issue
your
madeup
theism
is
what
it
ismade
up
its
wishful
thinking
nope
most
people
are
christian
most
people
are
fond

they

of
believing
that
the
world
is
an

place
of
reciting
magical
mystical
prayers
to
make
the
world
nice

of
doing
just
as
their
priests
tell
them

you
enjoy

youre

also
dictate

must
obey
what
the

mine
doesnt
is
this
a
bunch
of
lies
you
tell

so
that
you
can

brian
following
christ
has
nothing
to
do
with
the

you
would
find
any
of
your
doctrines
in

bible
i
dont
follow
kendigianism
i
follow
christ
also
to
try
to
again
show
you
your
ignorance
of
christ
and
the
bible
in
regards
to
priests
have
you
not
read
about
the
sole
melchizedek
priest
in
hebrews
and
have
you
not
read
what
the
purpose
is
of
the
old
testament
levitical
priesthood
and
why
there
should
not
be
priests
today
yes
guess
what
the
catholics
messed
up
i
do
not
follow
catholicism
or
any
ism
i
follow
christ
nope
you
make
decisions
enjoy
your
successes
and
accept
your
failures
then
you
die
if
you
are
content
with
the
life
youve
led
as
you
reflect
back
on
it
in
your
final
moments
then
youve
led
a
good
life
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
jesus
was
sacrified
to
fufill
the
old
testament
sacrificial
system
in
its
every
detail
jesuss
death
was

he
needed

i
learned
that
god
loves
his
children
who
have
never
heard
of
him
and
has
a
plan
for
redeeming
them
too
even
those
who
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
christ
i
learned
that
a
man
cannot
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his
death
bed
because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling
of
remorse
it
requires
faith
in
christ
proven
by
following
him
by
keeping
his
commandments
such
cannot
be
accomplished
on
ones
deathbed
so
jesus
must
have
lied

robert
weiss
says
just
briefly
on
something
that
you
mentioned
in
passing
you
refer
to
differing
interpretations
of
create
and
say
that
many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
im
sorry
i
thought
we
were
discussing
heresy
i
assumed
that
heresy
meant
a
departure
from
orthodoxy
in
which
case
generally
accepted
belief
is
indeed
an
important
issue
in
this
case
the
definition
of
the
word
create
is
of
great
importance
since
creation
is
the
issue
being
discussed
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
i
should
have
said
given
the
mormon
belief
if
you
disagree
with
the
mormon
belief
that
creation
is
more
a
function
of
organization
of
eternally
existent
substance
than
one
of
ex
nihilo
creation
then
that
is
the
important
point
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
correction
you
interpret
the
bible
to
mean
something
very
specific
by
such
terms
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
it
always
cracks
me
up
when
antimormons
presume
to
tell
mormons
what
they
believe
mormons
do
in
fact
believe
that
all
people
including
christ
and
lucifer
are
children
of
god
in
the
sense
that
we
were
all
created
or
organized
or
whatever
by
him
we
also
believe
that
being
offspring
of
god
has
a
symbolic
sense
when
applied
to
being
spiritually
born
again
of
him
thus
the
same
word
can
be
used
to
convey
different
meanings
this
is
how
language
works
robert
and
its
why
making
someone
an
offender
for
a
word
is
dangerous
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
for
we
first
look
to
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
to
discount
or
not
even
address
what
the
bible
teaches
because
there
are
some
groups
that
have
differing
views
is
selfdefeating
to
see
what
the
bible
teaches
you
have
to
look
at
the
bible
on
the
contrary
robert
it
is
not
a
red
herring
at
all
to
show
that
those
who
rely
wholly
on
the
bible
cannot
seem
to
agree
on
what
it
says
you
say
that
one
must
simply
look
at
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
but
centuries
of
people
doing
just
that
have
that
no
one
is
really
sure
what
it
says
are
we
to
believe
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
understands
the
scriptures
i
find
this
rather
curious
when
i
mentioned
that
the
mormon
belief
is
that
jesus
needed
to
be
saved
i
put
forward
some
quotes
from
the
late
apostle
bruce
mcconkie
the
curious
part
is
that
no
one
addressed
the
issue
of
jesus
needing
to
be
saved
rick
comes
the
closest
with
his
i
have
my
own
conclusions
to
addressing
the
point
let
me
clarify
this
one
more
time
you
did
not
refer
to
the
mormon
belief
that
jesus
needed
to
be
saved
but
rather
to
mcconkies
belief
in
same
we
keep
trying
to
point
out
to
you
that
bruce
mcconkie
is
not
the
source
of
mormon
doctrine
and
you
keep
ignoring
it
see
below
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies
writings
indicative
of
mormon
belief
on
this
subject
is
the
real
issue
the
indication
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainly
be
on
the
contrary
robert
if
you
are
quoting
mcconkies
words
as
mormon
canon
then
the
question
of
whether
they
are
canon
or
not
is
of
great
importance
the
fact
is
that
they
are
not
whether
or
not
they
indicate
general
mormon
belief
would
only
be
ascertainable

interviewing

large
number

they
massacred
thousands

hunts

there
were
many
injustices
in

and
this
is
truely
sad
i
would
hate
to
see
a
day
when
churches
put
people
to
death
or
torchured
them
for
practicing
homosexuality
or
any
other
crime
the
church
is
not
called
to
take
over
the
governments
of
the
world
it
may
be
that
homosexuals
treated
cruelly
today
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
should
teach
christians
to
practice
homosexual
immorality
do
you
think
that
we
should
also
teach
christians
to
practice
divination
and
channelling
because
the
witches
in
the
middle
ages
were
persecuted
the
major
flaw
in
all
this
posturing
is
that
in
the
end
the
final
effect
of
posts
like
that
of
yours
and
mr
hudson
is
that
you
have
a
conditional
love
for
gays
condition
change
and
well
love
you
this
is
sure
strange
coming
from
a
group
who
claim
that
god
has
an
unconditional
love
one
that
calls
people
just
as
they
are
and
you
accuse
me
of
judging
when
did
you
look
into
my
heart
and
see
if
i
have
love
i
have
been
writing
that
we
should
not
teach
christians
to
practice
homosexual
immorality
and
you
pretend
to
have
divine
knowledge
to
look
into
my
heart
i
cant
say
that
i
love
homosexuals
as
i
should
i
cant
say
that
i
love
my
neighbor
as
i
should
either
i
dont
know
very
many
homosexuals
as
it
is
but
jesus
loves
homosexuals
just
as
he
loves
everyone
else
if
his
love
were
conditional
i
not
know
him
at
all
yes
we
should
show
love
to
homosexuals
but
it
is
not
love
to
encourage
brothers
in
the
church
to
stumble
and
continue
in
their
sin
that
is
a
very
damaging
and
dangerous
thing
the
results
of
the
passing
amendment
in
colorado
has
created
an
organization
whos
posters
are
appearing
all
over
colorado
called
straight
i
forget
the
whole
definition
off
hand
but
the
last
part
was
against
immoral
gross
homosexual
trash
and
their
motto
is
working
for
a
fagfree
america
with
an
implicit
advocation
for
violence
this
is
sick
and
it
seems
to
be
what
you
and
mr
hudson
and
others
are
embracing
that
is
slander
i
could
just
as
easily
say
that
nambla
has
been
able
to
implement
legislation
to
make
child
molesting
easier
because
of
the
tearing
down
of
societies
morality
due
to
people
accepting
homosexuality
as
normal
and
that
this
is
what
you
are
embracing
i
do
believe
that
homosexual
sex
is
immoral
that
does
not
mean
i
endorse
using
violence
against
them
there
is
a
problem
of
hatred
in
the
church
but
there
is
also
the
problem
of
what
has
been
called
unsanctified
mercy
many
in
the
conservative
churches
have
seen
the
moral
breakdown
in
this
country
and
the
storm
on
the
horizon
and
have
gotten
militant
in
the
flesh
this
is
truely
sad
yet
others
in
other
churches
have
embraced
immorality
in
society
and
have
pointed
to
the
carnality
in
the
conservative
churches
to
justify
their
actions
why
dont
we
just
stick
to
the
positive
and
find
ways
to
bring
people
to
jesus
istead
of
taking
bullwhips
and
driving
them
away
certainly
we
should
not
use
a
bullwhip
to
drive
people
from
jesus
but
we
shouldnt
water
down
the
gospel
to
draw
people
in
jesus
didnt
go
out
of
his
way
to
show
only
what
might
be
considered
positive
aspects
to
draw
people
in
he
told
one
man
to
sell
all
he
had
he
told
another
not

since

you

directed
a

again
based
on
a
lack

to

by

toward

i
pointed
out
that
i
did
in

agree
that
both
robert

jim
meritt
took
quotes
out

hence
i
find
it
difficult

why
jim

am

needless
to
say
i
dont

time
to

to
every
article
on

that
takes
a
quote
out

i
asked
jim
the
following
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
jim
replied
by
saying
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articles
from
jim
one
of
which
has
the
subject
silence
is
concurrence
james
meritt
writes
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eyes
of
the

when
someone
is
aware

something
and
has
the
capability
of
taking

and
does
not
that
individual
may
be
held
responsible
for
that
action
which
is
of
course
a
complete
red
herring
taking
quotes
out

isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
every
article
on
trm
and
im
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
reply
to
them
all
does
silence
is
concurrence
imply
that
jim
thinks
that
because
i
didnt
respond
to
weiss
articles
i
must
condone
weiss
taking
quotes
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
this
question
read
what
he
has
written
and
decide
for
yourself
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
conversation
with
jim
jims
next
gambit
was
to
claim
that
he
was
using
inductive
logic
when
he
concluded
that
i
was
being
a
hypocrite
i
challenged

be
made
if

are

to

is
it
not

axed
his

not

he

i
cant

where
he
is
going
with

i
can
help
him
with
his

ive
written
roughly
articles
since

the

of

are

where
i
take
the

that
they
are
making
bad

some
are
discussions
with

where
i
take
the
position
that
he
is
making

yesterday
the

and
the
second
more
serious
one
appeared
along
the
thread
a
chaney
post
and
a
challenge
reissued
and
revised
both
only
in
talkabortion
but
i
am
posting
its
contents
into
talkreligionmisc
as
soon
as
i
exit
here
this
should
be
enough
for
us
to
thrash
out
for
the
next
week
or
so
the
second
post
really
grapples
with
the
main
bones
of
contention
between
us
the
first
is
more
lighthearted
and
tells
about
such
things
as
kaflowitzdebatingpoints
tm
which
he
continues
to
rack
up
on
both
talkabortion
and
talkreligionmisc
while
setting
followups
to
talkabortion
alone
his
lame
excuse
for
the
latter
policy
is
that
he
gets
a
prompt
as
to
where
to
set
followups
and
does
not
follow
talkreligionmisc
much
this
suggests
that
he
is
being
hypocritical
in
not
also
setting

out
of

though
i

not
can
you
show
me
anything
that
would
lead
you
to
think
otherwise
see
the
spreading

thread
in
which
he
says
i
ignore
certain
statements
that
i
specifically
acknowledged
and
dean
did
not
he
called
them
the
great
commission
but
this
is
not
descriptive
of
jesuss
words
in
matt
matt
jerusalem
bible
translation
and
if
anyone
does
not
welcome
you
or
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
as
you
walk
out
of
the
house
or

shake
the
dust
from
your
feet
matt
i
tell
you
solemnly
on
the
day
of
judgment
it
will
not
go
as
hard
with
the
land
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
as
with
that
town
in
the
post
to
which
dean
is
referring
above
i
said
the
above
is
a
good
description
of
kaflowitz
who
keeps
harping
on
shaking
the
dust
off
the
feet
but
ignoring
what
christ
said
next
the
highlighted
words
refer
to
matt
and
respectively
and
dean
countered
actually
this
comment
of
yours
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
an
intellectually
dishonest
little
sparrowfart
you
are
since
i
specifically
acknowledged
the
great
commission
and
the
entreaty
to
spread
the
word
in
fact
it
is
the
combination
of
the
two
statements
i
was
addressing
and
not
just
the
one
and
for
you
to
characterize
that
as
ignoring
the
instruction
to
spread
the
word
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
dishonest
little
fellow
you
are
of
course
matt
quoted
above
makes
no
mention
of
instruction
to
spread
the
word
all
these
quotes
btw
are
from
messageid
in
which
at
the
end
he
claims
i
did
not
answer
a
question
which
i
answered
and
which
he
deleted
to
get
the
chronology
right
he
deleted
the
answer
and
then
said
i
didnt
answer
and
i
claim
it
correctly
because
my
question
went
do
you
too
measure
the
goodness
of
a
post
by
its
entertainment
value
and
care
not
a
whit
for
such
mundane
things
as
truth
and
falsehood
and
the
closest
dean
came
to
an
answer
was
peter
peter
peter
youre
just
so
stupid
pretentious
dull
and
generally
unworthy
of
the
value
you
place
on
yourself
that
the
sport
is
all
there
is
of
course
this
does
not
answer
my
question
which
has
to
do
with
posts
in
general
and
not
my
posts
in
particular
surely
even
dean
knows
this
yet
he
brazenly
asserts
otherwise
reinforcing
his
claim
with
an
insult
so
i
now
restore
the
answer
to
your
question
that
you
deleted
if
youre
still
unable
to
figure
it
out
ask
a
nice
kid
at
the
local
junior
high
to
help
you
it
really
doesnt
take
much
sophistication
to
understand
on
top
of
which
i
doubt
that
the
answer
is
at
all
representative
of
deans
true
frame
of
mind
the
insults
you
have
seen
quoted
thus
far
are
but
a
small
sample
of
the
stream
that
oozes
out
of
deans
mind
throughout
the
post
from
which
these
quotes
were
taken
one
wonders
whether
deans
mind
is
so
warped
as
to
find
sport
in
all
this
he
even
dredges
up
a
falsified
account
of
events
that
transpired
earlier
on
another
thread
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
claiming
that
it
was
in
the
tradition
of
lent
to
make
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
other
individuals
false
i
said
it
was
the
tradition
to
recall
and
atone
for
ones
sins
that
i
made
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
others
sins
btw
that
were
a
matter
of
public
record
documented
in
the
posts
of
others
is
a
different
matter
many
of
the
individuals
involved
are
so
nearly
amoral
that
they
do
not
see
as
sins
what
morally
upright
people
see
as
sins
so
i
pointed
some
of
them
out
and
i
expressly
set
up
a
whole
thread
your
turn
to
let
people
point
out
my
sins
to
me
dean
again
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
saying
that
my
statement
of
the
tradition
of
tzedukkah
was
somehow
an
attempt
to
paint
jews
as
plaster
saints
thereby
revealing
your
inability
to
understand
the
discussion
as
well
as
showing
your
dislike
for
people
saying
positive
things
about
jews
and
now
you
show
your
intellectual
dishonesty
by
repeatedly
ignoring
the
simple
argument
being
made
and
then
claiming
i
am
ignoring
the
very
argument
i
acknowledge
actually
what
happened
was
that
dean
made
it
seem
like
any
jew
who
gave
alms
or
did
other
acts
of
charity
in
public
was
a
hypocrite
according
to
jewish
customs
in
doing
so
he
was
caricaturing
jewish
customs
as
being
almost
impossibly
demanding
as
well
as
implicitly
slandering
all
jews
who
make
public
their
acts
of
charity
i
went
very
easily
on
dean
for
this
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
a
post
following
my
initial
crack
about
plaster
saints
suggesting
that
he
had
been
merely
careless
in
his
wording
in
an
astonishing
act
of
ingratitude
dean
now
serves
up
an
incredibly
distorted
picture
of
what
took
place
between
us
and
using
it
as
the
basis
of
one
insult
after
another

certainly

according

frankly
i
find
the
occurance
of
a

christian
attempting
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
straight
christian
in
order
to
have

more

is

walter
subject
the
divine
masters
the
divine
masters
most
christians
would
agree
and
correctly
so
that
jesus
christ
was
a
divine
master
and
a
projection
of
god
into
the
physical
world
god
incarnate
but
there
are
some
very
important
related
facts
that
christians
are
completely
ignorant
of
as
are
followers
of
most
other
world
religions
first
jesus
christ
was
not
unique
john
notwith
standing
there
is
always
at
least
one
such
divine
master
god
incarnate
physically
alive
in
this
world
at
all
times
a
continuous
succession
throughout
history
both
before
and
after
the
life
of
jesus
the
followers
of
some
of
these
masters
founded
the
worlds
major
religions
usually
perverting
the
teachings
of
their
master
in
the
process
christians
for
example
added
threats
of
eternal
damnation
in
hell
and
deleted
the
teaching
of
reincarnation
secondly
and
more
importantly
after
a
particular
master
physically
dies
and
leaves
this
world
there
is
nothing
that
he
can
do
for
anybody
except
for
the
relatively
few
people
that
he
initiated
while
he
was
still
physically
alive
that
is
simply
the
way
god
set
things
up
in
the
universes
therefore
all
those
christians
who
worship
jesus
and
pray
to
jesus
and
expect
jesus
to
return
and
save
them
from
their
sins
are
only
kidding
themselves
and
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
duped
by
a
religion
that
was
mostly
manufactured
by
the
romans
and
emotional
feelings
are
a
totally
deceiving
indicator
for
religious
validity
these
things
are
similarly
true
for
followers
of
most
other
major
world
religions
including
islam
thirdly
the
primary
function
of
each
master
is
to
tune
his
initiates
into
the
audible
life
stream
or
sound
current
referred
to
as
the
word
in
john
and
as
the
river
of
life
in
revelation
and
to
personally
guide
each
of
them
thru
the
upper
levels
of
heaven
while
they
are
still
connected
to
their
living
physical
bodies
by
a
silver
cord
true
salvation
which
completes
a
souls
cycles
of
reincarnation
in
the
physical
and
psychic
planes
is
achieved
only
by
reaching
at
least
the
soul
plane
which
is
five
levels
or
universes
above
the
physical
universe
and
this
cannot
be
done
without
the
help
of
a
physicallyliving
divine
master
one
such
divine
master
alive
today
is
an
american
sri
harold
klemp
the
living
eck
master
or
mahanta
for
the
eckankar
organization
now
headquartered
in
minneapolis
po
box

another
divine
master
is
maharaj
gurinder
singh
ji
now
living
in
punjab
india
and
is
associated
with
the
sant
mat
organization
one
of
the
classic
books
on
this

is

path
of
the

closely
observing

some
authored

be
found
in

public

stores
or
obtained
thru
interlibrary
loan
the
book
eckankarthe
key
to
secret
worlds
by
sri
paul
twitchell
is
another
classic
many
christians
are
likely
to
confuse
the
masters
with
the
antichrist
which
is
or
was
to
be
a
temporary
world
dictator
during
the
socalled
last
days
but
the
masters
dont
ever
rule
even
when
asked
or
expected
to
do
so
as
jesus
was
people
who
continue
following
christianity
islam
or
other
orthodox
religions
with
a
physicallydead
master
will
continue
on
their
cycles
of
reincarnation
between
the
psychic
planes
and
this
miserable
physical
world
until
they
finally
accept
initiation
from
a

divine
master
reincarnation
the
book
here
and
hereafter
by
ruth
montgomery
describes
several
kinds
of
evidence
supporting
reincarnation
as
a
fact
of
life
including
hypnotic
regressions
to
past
lives
about
accurate
the
subconscious
mind
sometimes
makes
things
up
especially
with
a
bad

by

how
can
a
person
possibly
sin
before
he
is
born
unless
he
lived
before
always
use
the
king
james
version
later
versions
are
perversions
strong
interests
innate
talents
strong
phobias
etc
typically
originate
from
a
persons
past
lives
for
example
a
strong
fear
of
swimming
in
or
traveling
over
water
usually
results
from
having
drowned
at
the
end
of
a
previous
life
and
sometimes
a
person
will
take
an
immediate
dislike
to
another
person
being
met
for
the
first
time
in
this
life
because
of
a
bad
encounter
with
him
during
a
previous
incarnation
the
teaching
of
reincarnation
also
includes
the
law
of
karma
galatians
revelation
etc
people
would
behave
much
better
toward
each
other
if
they
knew
that
their
actions
in
the
present
will
surely
be
reaped
by
them
in
the
future
or
in
a
future
incarnation
comings
if
a
divine
master
physically
dies
translates
before
a
particular
initiate
of
his
does
then
when
that
initiate
physically
dies
translates
the
master
will
meet
him
on
the
astral
level
and
take
him
directly
to
the
soul
plane
this
is
the
one
and
only
correct
meaning
of
a
coming
it
is
an
individual
experience
not
something
that
happens
for
everyone
all
at
once
people
who
are
still
waiting
for
jesus
coming
are
waiting
in
vain
planes
of
existence
the
physical
universe
is
the
lowest
of
at
least
a
dozen
major
levels
of
existence
above
the
physical
plane
is
the
astral
plane
the
causal
plane
the
mental
plane
the
etheric
plane
often
counted
as
the
upper
part
of
the
mental
plane
the
soul
plane
and
several
higher
spiritual
planes
the
soul
plane
is
the
first
true
heaven
counting
upward
from
the
physical
the
planes
between
but
not
including
the
physical
and
soul
planes
are
called
the
psychic
planes
it
is
likely
that
esp
telepathy
astrological
influences
radionic
effects
biological
transmutations
see
the
book
with
that
title
and
other
phenomena
without
an
apparent
physical
origin
result
from
interactions
between
the
psychic
planes
and
the
physical
plane
the
major
planes
are
also
subdivided
for
example
a
subplane
of
the
astral
plane
is
called
hades
and
the
christian
hell
occupies
a
small
part
of
it
created
there
less
than
years
ago
by
the
early
catholic
church
by
some
kind
of
black
magic
or
by
simply
teaching
its
existence
in

subject
re
freemasonry
and
the
southern
baptist
convention
there
were
some
recent
developments
in
the
dispute
about
masonry
among
southern
baptists
i
posted
a
summary
over
in
bitlistservchristia
and
i
suppose
that
it
might
be
useful
here
note
that
i
do
not
necessarily
agree
or
disagree
with
any
of
what
follows
i
present
it
as
information
for
a
short
summary
a
southern
baptist
named
larry
holly
wrote
a
book
claiming
that
freemasonry
is
a
religion
incompatible
with
christianity
mr
hollys
father
rejects
christianity
and
mr
holly
blames
that
on
the
masons
the
sbcs
home
missions
board
includes
an
interfaith
witness
department
which
studies
other
religions
and
how
to
teach
them
about
christ
a
few
years
ago
they
were
ordered
to
produce
a
report
on
masonry
they
concluded
that
it
was
not
a
religion
and
therefore
was
outside
their
speciality
however
mr
holly
led
a
movement
of
people
who
oppose
masonry
and
last
year
the
convention
again
ordered
the
hmb
to
study
masonry
i
got
the
feeling
that
they
were
saying
you
got
the
wrong
answer
last
time
try
to
do
better
and
get
the
answer
we
want
anyway
theres
been
a
bit
of
infighting
and
some
inappropriate
actions
but
the
dust
has
settled
and
the
report
is
in
nobody
is
entirely
happy
with
it
but
everybody
seems
willing
to
live
with
it
both
sides
are
saying
things
such
as
this
was
the
best
we
were
going
to
get
in
the
current
environment
the
report
commends
the
masons
for
the
charity
work
they
do
such
as
the
hospitals
and
burn
centers
they
operate
as
well
as
efforts
to
help
the
elderly
and
prevent
drug
abuse
the
report
acknowledges
that
many
well
known
christians
are
and
have
been
masons
and
notes
that
many
teachings
of
masonry
are
supportive
of
christian
faith
and
practice
examples
of
the
latter
include
belief
in
god
emphases
on
honesty
and
integrity
and
that
some
masonic
lodges
incorporate
explicit
christian
beliefs
on
the
other
hand
they
note
that
some
aspects
of
masonry
are
incompatible
with
southern
baptist
principles
these
included
the
use
of
titles
which
some
people
consider
sacrilegious
the
taking
of
certain
oaths
even
though
they
are
not
meant
seriously
the
undeniably
pagan
andor
occultic
writings
of
some
masonic
leaders
the
implication
in
some
masonic
writings
that
salvation
can
be
achieved
by
good
works
and
the
racial
discrimination
practiced
by
many
masonic
lodges
i
note
with
some
chagrin
that
baptist
churches
as
a
whole
arent
really
in
a
place
to
speak
on
this
last
point
the
report
concludes
that
masonry
is
not
a
religion
and
says
that
membership
should
not
be
endorsed
or
censured
but
left
to
the
discretion
of
individuals
this
was
in
part
because
there
is
variation
among
different
masonic
lodges
and
while
one
may
include
elements
strongly
against
christianity
another
may
not
many
southern
baptists
have
strong
convictions
about
the
priesthood
of
the
believer
and
the
autonomy
of
the
local
church
and
this
history
probably
influenced
how
the
report
came
out
the
information
above
was
gleaned
from
the
religious
herald
a
publication
of
the
baptist
general
association
of
virginia
and
baptists
today
which
does
not
have
any
direct
links
to
a
religious
organisation
autonomy
is
a
big
issue
among
some
baptists
because
i
have
neither
the
report
itself
nor
whatever
masonic
documents
are
relevant

can

in

a
work
whose
iranian
roots
are
undeniable
and
which
most
likely
dates
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
probably
the
second
century
ce
widengren
the
zoroastrian
doctrine
of
the
savior
of
the
future
saoshyant
was
the
basis
for
the
story
of
the
coming
of
the
magi
to
bethlehem
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
the
old
persian
word
magu
rendered
in
greek
by
magos
is
of
uncertain
etymology
it
may
originally
have
meant
member
of
the
tribe
as
in
the
avestan
compound
mogutbish
hostile
to
a
member
of
the
tribe
this
meaning
would
have
been
further
resticted
among
the
medes
to
member
of
the
priestly
tribe
and
perhaps
to
priest
benveniste
boyce
the
term
is
probably
of
median
origin
given
that
herodotus
mentions
the
magoi
as
one
of
the
six
tribes
of
the
medes
for
a
variety
of
reasons
we
can
consider
the
magi
to
have
been
members
of
a
priestly
tribe
of
median
origin
in
western
iran
among
the
persians
they
were
responsible
for
liturgical
functions
as
well
as
for
maintaining
their
knowledge
of
the
holy
and
the
occult
most
likely
the
supremacy
of
the
median
priesthood
in
western
iran
became
established
during
the
time
of
the
median
monarchy
that
dominated
the
persians
from
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
through
the
first
half
of
the
sixth
century
bce
until
the
revolt
of
cyrus
the
great
bce
the
persians
were
indebted
to
the
medes
for
their
political
and
civil
institutions
as
well
even
if
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
concerning
the
existence
of
magi
of
persian
origin
in
the
achaemenid
period
boyce
we
must
still
maintain
that
they
were
of
median
origin
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
eposide
of
the
revolt
of
gaumata
the
magian
mentioned
by
darius
i
bce
in
the
inscription
at
bisutun
iran
as
well
as
by
greek
sources
indeed
herodotus
insists
on
the
idea
of
the
usurpatory
power
of
the
medes
against
the
persians
through
the
conspiracy
of
the
magi
the
fact
that
the
magi
may
have
been
members
of
a
tribe
that
handed
down
the
sacerdotal
arts
in
a
hereditary
fashion
naturally
did
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
some
of
them
undertook
secular
prefessions
this
seems
to
be
attested
by
the
elamite
tablets
at
persepolis
there
is
a
theses
put
forth
by
giuseppe
messina
that
denies
that
the
magi
are
members
of
an
ethnic
group
by
suggesting
that
they
are
simply
members
of
the
priesthood
a
priesthood
of
purely
zoroastrian
origin
this
thesis
is
untenable
on
the
other
hand
the
hypothesis
that
their
name
is
related
to
the
avestan
term
magavan
derived
from
the
gathic
maga
vedic
magha
gift
is
not
without
foundation
mole
the
meaning
of
maga
can
probably
be
found
in
conformity
with
the
pahlavi
tradition
within
the
context
of
the
concept
of
purity
or
separation
of
the
mixture
of
the
two
opposed
principles
of
spirit
and
matter
the
maga
which
has
been
erroneously
interpreted
as
chorus
from
the
root
mangh
which
is
said
to
mean
sing
the
magic
song
nyberg
and
has
been
rendered
simply
by
an
expression
like
unio
mystica
seems
to
be
an
ecstatic
condition
that
opens
the
mind
to
spiritual
vision
in
any
case
though
there
may
be
a
relation
between
the
old
persian
term
magu
and
the
avestan
terms
magavan
and
maga
we
must
maintain
a
clear
distinction
between
the
magi
and
the
avestan
priesthood
the
avesta
ignores
the
median
or
old
persian
term
despite
a
recent
hypothesis
proposed
by
hw
bailey
old
persian
inscriptions
ignore
the
avestan
term
for
priest
athravan
vedic
athravan
even
if
this
is
perhaps
present
in
an
achaeminid
setting
in
the
elamite
tablets
of
persepolis
gershevitch
the
term
magu
has
been
present
in
zoroastrianism
throughout
its
history
the
pahlavi
terms
moghmard
and
mobad
represent
its
continuation
the
latter
in
particular
derives
from
an
older
form
magupati
head
of
the
magi
during
the
sasanid
period
third
to
seventh
centuries
ce
which
saw
the
formation
of
a
hierarchically
organized
church
the
title
mobadan
mobad
the
high
priest
of
high
priests
came
to
be
used
to
designate
the
summit
of
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
the
magi
practiced
consanguineous
marriage
or
khvaetvadatha
av
pahl
khwedodah
they
also
performed
a
characteristic
funeral
rite
the
exposure
of
the
corpse
to
animals
and
vultures
to
remove
the
flesh
and
thereby
cleanse
it
the
corpse
was
not
supposed
to
decompose
lest
it
be
contaminated
by
the
demons
of
putrefaction
this
practice
later
became
typical
of
the
entire
zoroastrian
community
and
led
to
the
rise
of
a
complex
funeral
ritual
in
iran
and
among
the
parsis
in
india
stone
towers
known
as
dakhmas
were
built
especially
for
this
rite
during
the
time
of
herodotus
the
practice
of
exposure
of
the
corpse
was
in
vogue
only
among
the
magi
the
persians
generally
sprinkled
the
corpse
with
wax
then
buried
it
the
practice
was
widespread
however
among
the
peoples
of
central
asia
the
magi
were
the
technicians
of
and
experts
on
worship
it
was
impossible
to
offer
sacrifices
without
the
presence
of
a
magus
during
the
performance
of
a
ritual
sacrifice
the
magus
sang
of
the
theogony
the
magi
were
possibly
the
custodians
of
a
tradition
of
sacred
poetry
but
we
know
nothing
about
the
relationship
of
this
tradition
to
the
various
parts
of
the
avesta
and
was
called
upon
to
interpret
dreams
and
to
divine
the
future
the
magi
were
also
known
for
the
practice
of
killing
harmful
or
ahrimanical
animals
khrafstra
such
as
snakes
and
ants
they
dressed
in
the
median
style
wearing
pants
tunics
and
coats
with
sleeves
they
wore
a
characteristic
head
covering
of
felt
gr
tiara
with
strips
on
the
sides
that
could
be
used
to
cover
the
nose
and
mouth
during
rituals
to
avoid
contaminating
consecrated
objects
with
their
breath
boyce
the
color
of
these
caps
in
conformity
with
a
tradition
that
is
probably
of
indoeuropean
origin
according
to
georges
dumezil
was
that
of
the
priesthood
white
in
all
likelihood
during
the
achaemenid
period
the
magi
were
not
in
possession
of
a
welldefined
body
of
doctrine
and
it
is
probable
that
they
gradually
adopted
zoroastrianism
they
were
most
likely
a
clergy
consisting
of
professional
priests
who
were
not
tied
to
a
rigid
orthodoxy
but
were
naturally
inclined
to
eclecticism
and
syncretism
nonetheless
they
must
have
been
jealous
guardians
of
the
patrimony
of
zorastrian
traditions
by
virtue
of
this
they
were
the
educators
of
the
royal
princes
the
wisest
of
them
was
responsible
for
teaching
the
prince
the
magic
of
zarathushtra
son
of
horomazes
and
thus
the
cult
of
the
gods
magi
who
excelled
in
other
virtues
were
entrusted
with
the
education
of
the
prince
so
that
he
would
learn
to
be
just
courageous
and
master
of
himself
during
the
achaemenid
period
the
magi
maintained
a
position
of
great
influence
although
they
were
certainly
subordinate
to
the
emperor
despite
several
dramatic
events
such
as
the
massacre
they
suffered
after
the
death
of
gaumata
the
magian
in
which
according
to
herodotus
who
calls
himself
smerdis
the
persians
killed
a
large
number
of
magi
to
avenge
the
usurpation
the
magi
nevertheless
managed
to
maintain
their
influence
at
court
in
media
in
persia
and
in
the
various
regions
of
the
empire
where
they
were
stationed
as
a
consequence
of
the
persian
civilian
and
military
administration
no
priesthood
of
antiquity
was
more
famous
than
that
of
the
magi
they
were
renowned
as
followers
of
zarathushtra
zoroaster
as
the
teachers
of
some
of
the
greatest
greek
thinkers
pythagoras
democritus
plato
as
the
wise
men
who
arrived
guided
by
a
star
at
the
manger
of
the
newborn
savior
in
bethlehem
and
as
the
propagators
of
a
cult
of
the
sun
in
india
but
they
were
also
known
as
the
chaldeans
the
priesthood
of
babylon
known
for
its
occultism
this
was
perhaps
the
reason
that
the
term
magos
had
a
pejorative
sense
in
greek
like
goes
expert
in
the
magic
arts
bidez
and
cumont
indeed
the
chaldeans
were
experts
in
all
types
of
magical
arts
especially
astrology
and
had
a
reputation
for
wisdom
as
well
as
knowledge
to
understand
the
reasons
for
such
various
and
sometimes
discordant
views
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
magi
of
iran
proper
and
the
socalled
western
magi
who
were
later
hellenized
in
the
achaemenid
period
both
must
have
been
at
least
in
part
zoroastrian
but
the
western
magi
those
of
the
iranian
diaspora
in
asia
minor
syria
mesopotamia
and
armenia
who
came
in
contact
with
diverse
religious
traditions
must
have
sooner
or
later
and
in
varying
degrees
been
influenced
by
syncretic
concepts
the
greeks
were
familiar
with
both
kinds
of
magi
and
depending
on
their
varying
concerns
would
emphasize
one
or
the
other
aspect
of
them
classical
historians
and
geographers
including
herodotus
and
strabo
document
their
customs
while
the
philosophers
dwell
above
all
on
their
doctrines
dualism
belief
in
the
hereafter
magian
cosmology
and
cosmogony
and
their
theology
and
eschatology
those
sources
most
interested
in
the
doctrines
of
the
magi
even
speak
of
zarathushtra
as
a
magus
in
doing
so
they
are
repeating
what
the
magi
themselves
said
from
the
median
and
achaemenid
periods
when
they
adopted
zoroastrianism
at
that
time
they
embraced
zarathushtra
as
one
of
their
own
and
placed
themselves
under
his
venerable
name
zoroastrianism
had
already
undergone
several
profound
transformations
in
the
eastern
community
by
the
time
of
the
acheamenids
and
was
already
adapting
those
elements
of
the
archaic
religion
that
refused
to
die
it
has
been
said
quite
often
in
an
attempt
to
characterize
the
precise
role
of
the
magi
in
the
zoroastrian
tradition
that
the
vendidad
from
vidaevodata
the
lawabjuring
daivas
part
of
the
avesta
should
be
attributed
to
them
this
collection
of
texts
from
various
periods
is
primarily
concerned
with
purificatory
rules
and
practices
nonetheless
the
hypothesis
is
hardly
plausible
since
the
first
chapter
of
the
vendidad
a
list
of
sixteen
lands
created
by
ahura
mazda
the
supreme
god
of
zoroastrianism
but
contaminated
by
an
attack
by
ahriman
pahl
gathicavestan
angra
mainyu
the
other
supreme
god
and
the
ultimate
source
of
all
evil
and
suffering
does
not
mention
western
iran
persia
or
media
the
land
of
ragha
mentioned
in
the
text
cannot
be
median
raghiana
furthermore
it
has
been
noted
gershevitch
that
if
the
authors
had
been
magi
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
western
iranian
institutions
including
their
own
priesthood
would
be
very
strange
the
magi
were
above
all
the
means
by
which
the
zoroastrian
tradition
and
the
corpus
of
the
avesta
have
been
transmitted
to
us
from
the
second
half
of
the
first
millennium
bce
on
this
has
been
their
principal
merit
we
can
attribute
directly
to
the
magi
the
new
formulation
that
iranian
dualism
assumed
known
to
us
especially
from
greek
sources
and
in
part
from
the
pahlavi
literature
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
ce
according
to
this
formulation
the
two
poles
of
the
dualism
are
no
longer
as
in
the
gathas
spenta
mainyu
beneficent
spirit
and
angra
mainyu
hostile
spirit
but
ahura
mazda
himself
and
angra
mainyu
gershevitch
see
ahura
mazda
and
angra
mainyu
this
trans
formation
was
of
immense
consequence
for
the
historical
development
of
zoro
astrianism
and
was
most
likely
determined
by
the
contact
of
the
magi
with
the
mesopotamian
religious
world
in
this
new
dualism
which
was
that
later
known
to
the
greeks
aristotle
eudemus
of
rhodes
theopompus
and
others
we
can
see
the
affirmation
of
a
new
current
of
thought
within
zoroastrianism
to
which
we
give
the
name
zurvanism
see
zurvanism
thanks
to
their
adherence
to
zoroastrianism
the
magi
played
an
enormously
important
role
in
the
transmission
of
zarathushtras
treachings
as
well
as
in
the
definition
of
the
new
forms
that
these
would
assume
historically
their
natural
propensity
to
eclecticism
and
syncretism
also
helped
the
diffusion
of
zoroastrian
ideas
in
the
communities
of
the
iranian
diaspora
the
greeks
began
to
study
their
doctrines
and
to
take
an
interest
in
them
xanthus
of
lydia
hermodorus
aristotle
theopompus
hermippus
dinon
even
writing
treatises
on
the
persian
religion
of
which
only
the
titles
and
a
few
fragments
have
survived
in
the
hellenistic
period
the
magi
were
seen
as
a
secular
school
of
wisdom
and
writings
on
magic
astrology
and
alchemy
were
lent
the
authority
of
such
prestigious
names
as
zarathushtra
ostanes
and
hystaspes
forming
an
abundant
apocryphal
literature
bidez
and
cumont
later
still
eschatology
and
apocalyptics
were
a
fertile
meeting
ground
for
iranian
and
judeochristian
religions
as
can
be
seen
in
the
famous
oracles
of
hystaspes
a
work
whose
iranian
roots
are
undeniable
and
which
most
likely
dates
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
probably
the
second
century
ce
widengren
the
zoroastrian
doctrine
of
the
savior
of
the
future
saoshyant
was
the
basis
for
the
story
of
the
coming
of
the
magi
to
bethlehem
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
see
saoshyant
the
sasanid
period
saw
the
magi
once
again
play
a
determining
role
in
the
religious
history
of
iran
concerned
to
win
back
the
western
magi
de
menasce
and
eager
to
consolidate
zoroastrianism
as
the
national
religion
of
iran
the
priests
of
iranian
sanctuaries
in
media
and
persia
were
able
to
establish
a
true
state
church
strongly
hierarchical
and
endowed
with
an
orthodoxy
based
on
the
formation
of
a
canon
of
scriptures
the
leading
figures
in
the
development
of
a
state
religion
and
of
zoroastrian
orthodoxy
were

the
persecutors
of

future
benefactor
mpers
soshans
designates
the
savior
of
the
world
who
will
arrive
at
a
future
time
to

humankind
the
concept
of
the
future
savior
is
one
of
the
fundamental
notions
of
zoro
astrianism
together
with
that
of
dualism
it
appears
as
early
as
in
the
gathas
zarathushtra
zoroaster
as
the
prophet
of
the

himself
a

when

will
be
rehabilitated
and
made

see
frashokereti
later
zoroastrian
doctrine
developed
this
notion
into
a
true
eschatological
myth
and
expanded
the
number
of
saoshyants
from
one
to
three
all
the

born
from
the

astvatereta
will
appear
in
the
third
and
final
millennium
to
save
mankind
the
doctrine
of
the
future
savior
had
already
taken
shape
in
the
archaemenid
period
sixth
to
fourth
century
bce
it
was
not
perhaps
the
principal
element
in
the
formation
of
the
messianic
idea
but
it
was
certainly
a
determining
factor
one
that
enjoyed
great
success
in
the
hellenistic
period
beyond
the
confines
of
the
iranian
world
a
similar
concept
that
of
the
future
buddha
maitreya
was
most
likely
indebted
to
it
and
christian
messianism
can
trace
its
roots

stephen
thank
you
god
speed
no

numb
i
thought
something
like
this
was
going
to
happen
over
a
week
ago
one
of
the
things
thats
been
obvious
from
the
yah
start
is
that
when
there
are
two
armed
camps
neither
of
which
yields
its
usually
get
slaughtered
when
any
little
spark
sets
it
off
which
is
why
koresh
and
company
shouldnt
have
stockpiled
weapons
and
why
the
batf
shouldnt
have
come
primed
for
a
raid
bingo
am
i
the
only
one
to
notice
a
no

it
c
ah
god
children
at

at

and
more

all

point
if
the

fired

why
were
the

rather

taking

has
anyone
asked
themselves
these
questions
have
you
seen
the
entire

taken
during

i
seem
to
recall
missing
several
key
parts
a
the

five

one
only
the

comes
out
b
what
happened
to

you

wonder
why
not
how
is
it
you
can
have

present
and
not
have
an

you
realize
the
units
carry
ittle
bitty
backups
that
hold
minutes
per
unit
and
there
are
twounits
on

so
no

turnover

it

stephen
anyone
batf

xbd
other
could
have
touched
it
off
by
mistake
or
maliciously
more
on
this
below
once
koresh
was
shot
disregarding
his
being
a
religious
leader
and
apocalyptically
obsessed
most
likely
the
people
inside
just
went
on
drill
just
like
the
batf
outside
is
the
lesson
that
automatic
responses
are
very
hazardous
last
resort
measures
yes
but
it
is
so
hard
toremain
human
under
the
full
pressure
of

game
playing
and

painful
point
either
side
could
have
backed
off
to
help
defuse
the

we
see
the
problem
constantly
here
on

with
flaming
ego
problems
nuff
said
more
to
the
point
when
someone
dies
almost
like
it
was
intended
that
way
both
sides
will
kill
to
maintain
their
innocence
a
contradiction
in
terms
painful
point
it
doesnt
help
to
take
sides
in
such
a
situation
just
adds
fuel
to
the
fire
better
is
to
let
it
burn
out
on
its
own
true
usually
i
pick
the
unpopular
side
and
point
out
from
the
evidence
seen
what
might
have
alternatively
happened
best
example
i
can
think
of
is
christ
with
the
tax
coin
he
didnt
have
one
and
so
didnt
sanction
the
roman
authority
unduly
when
they
showed
it
to
him
he
noted
that
it
was
caesars
minting
and
so
said
give
it
to
him
no
waste
of
time
and
then
he
got
back
to
more
worthwhile
concerns
gods
will
this
requires
someone
interested
in
gods
will
please
note
that
the
outstanding
overt
problem
in
this
country
today
is
one
where
the
government
wants
caesars
coin
to
pay
off
the
debt
the
antitax
movement
of
today
and
the
antissanasid
groups
would
do
well
to
note
who
the
issuing
authority
is
ditto

those
yes
the
american
people
not
the

if
it
is
not
spent
towards
that
end
noone
deserves
the
coin
made

yah
fewpeople
hear
the
contradiction
money
made
in
the
image
of
god
no
need
to
stir
things
up
in
ever
larger
revorevorevolution
as
governments
turn
over
and
over
and
over
i
wish
you
were
wrong
many
pundits
are
saying
years
the
onyl
good
thing
to
come
out
of
my
divorce
and
my
exposure
to
the
damned
pardon
me
american
divorce
attorney
is
i
have
no
money
left
to
lose
to
taxes
or
inflation
painful
point
for
many
this
was
just
entertainment
thumbsup
thumbsdown
just
another
thriller
like
terminator
or
a
goodold
ball
game
is
the
lesson
that
weve
become
jaded
to
media
reality
children
dead
if
anyone
thinks
blaming
koresh
or
the
batf
helps
this
any
at
all
is
sick
and
wrong
the
reason
you
can
tell
that
the
batf
may
not
be
entirely
straight
on
this
is
that
the
leaders
at
press
conferences
havew
made
any
comments
about
even
the
possibility
that
koresh
or
his
followers
caused
this
the
batf
agentss
are
more
concerned
with
their
repuations
and
morals
not
my
fault
koresh
did
it
than
they
are
with
dead
children
same
goes
for
koresh
his
followers
who
are
all
mostly
dead
painful
point
la
burned
the
davidians
burned
in
one
case
society
has
abandoned
the
people
which
has
returned
to
a
frontier
in
the
other
the
outskirts
were
bumping
against
the
suburbs
is
the
lesson
that
whats
lawful
in
different
areas
of
society
depends
more
on
conditions
than
laws
more
on
power
and
favoritism
my
personal
opinion
look
to
history
whenever
privilege
has
replaced
whatever
token
of
objective
law
and
justice
a
society
has
had
hitlerrs
have
followed
if
we
dont
learnthelessons
or
at
least
make
an
honest
effort
the
next
conflagration
will
no
doubt
be
closer
to
home
rather
than
putting
out
fires
arent
there
much
more
important
concerns
for
us
to
work
on
you
do
your
name
sake
proud
stephen
its
hard
but
please
keep
on
keeping
on
each
voice
in
the
wilderness
now
will
save
a
generation
unborn
from
horror
kent
who
cant
cheers
today
exactly
what
keeps
me
from
being
a
bombthrower
is
my
loving
god
as
irra
tional
as
that
is
for
so
many
one
direct
benefit
is
being
able
to
keep
things
in
perspective
ks
the
day
i
need
a
gun
or
abomb
to
protect
myself
in
this
society
is
the
day
that
society
is
already
beyond
redemption
and
that
aint
redundant
if
you
have
any
christian
belief
aytall
and
the
day
that
i
cannot
peacefully
enjoin
others
in
the
act
that
thoreau
called
civil
disobedience
to
rectify
the
wrongs
that
my
society
practises
without
undue
harm
or
punishment
befalling
me
is
the
day
that
society
has
ceased
to
be
a
human
society
and
become
a
society
of
animals
we
are
very
cclose
to
that
such
as
who
hurts
more
the
ones
who
died
or
the
loved
ones
who
are
left
besides
the
lessons
its
also
time
for
many
to
grieve
including
those
whove
lost
their
faith
in
others
or
in
god
im
learning
to
be
patient
and
let
things
heal
god
willing
six
years
fighting
an
unjust
court
issue
still
struggling
to
be
patient
for
those
who
like
contrary
questions
nb
i
was
not
there
i
am
not
a
branch
davidian
nor
a
law
official
hater
i
do
hate
liars
or
the
six
letter
variety
of
same
the
official
side
has
its
advocates
already
lets
balance
the
equation
and
asj
a
few
questions
on
the
other
side
for
the
sake
of
an
old
saw
the
batf
abd
fbi
seem
to
want
to
bypass
innocent
until
proven
guilty
not
innocent
until
presumed
guilty
where
are
the
video
tapes
from
the
tanks
all
of
them
dont
tell
me
they
do
not
exist
they
are
standard
equipment
so
you
think
koresh
fired
the
place
because
of
the
explosion
a
tear
gas
comes
with
an
aerosol
to
spread
it
this
aerosol
is
deliberately
made
to
be
as
nonflammable
as
possible
it
is
as
nonflammable
as
possible
gotcha
when
in
isolation
from
other
substances
why
was
a
pipe
deliveryu
system
used
rather
than
remote

why
did
the
fbi
not
announce
this
window
blown
in
plus
tear

five
minutes
then
the

come
down
and
maintain
a
left

b
most
aerosols
also
have
a
secondary
compound
that
when
mixed
in
becomes
a
very
flammable
and
difficult
to
trace
suspension
with
a
very
special
property
exposure
to
brief
eruptions
of

a

what
other

come
up
in

who
else
will
be
allowed
to
test
the
site
c
after
a

ifdesired

why

do
you
see
any

coming
back
to

in

all
the

which
ones
are
missing
do
i
sound
paranoid
maybe
am
i
probably
not
you
trust
the
fbi
and
batf
to
render
judgement
in

of

god
help
us
for
we
are
surely
not
helping
ourselves
you
trut
the

you
are
trillion

counting
look
again
did
it
happen
that
way
i
do
not
know
i
was
not

and
it
should
wait
for

there

the

are
the

they

a

that
i

jehovahs

do
not

that
christians
are
required
to
observe
the

whether
it

the

so
there
have

that
ive

are

the

its
my

either
way
i
am
my

i
choose
what
i
want
to
do
i
weigh
the
benefits
of
my
actions
against
their
consequences
and
i
use
my
experience
to
help
me
deal
with
the
unexpected
which
in
turn
make
me
more
experienced
i
dont
always
succeed
but
i
never
fail
either
i
learn
do
you
have
any
habits
you
cant
break
why
not
for
one
you
seem
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
bible
i
have
arrived
at
my
own
understanding
of
christianity
just
as
youve
probably
arrived
at
your
own
understanding
of
islam
that
is
most
likely
very
different
from
the
way
a
moslem
thinks
of
his
religion
are
you
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
quran
if
thats
different
then
how
is
it
different
from
what
you
accuse
me
of
can
i
accuse
you
of
having
no
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
atheism
how
about
sexual
sins
gotta
any
of
those
secret
desires
in
your
head
that
you
harbor
but
can
get
control
of
do
you
dehumanize
women
when
they
walk
past
you
do
you
degrade
them
to
a
sex
object
in
your
head
of
course
not
thats
disgusting
for
centuries
religions
have
been
discriminating
on
sex
and
treating
women
as
secondclass
humans
thats
one
of
the
reasons
i
renounced
my
christianity
do
you
insult
people
unknowingly
then
regret
it
later
yet
do
it
again
the
next
time
opportunity
presents
itself
no
i
dont
insult
people
period
its
not
in
my
nature
and
its
not
something
that
i
want
to
do
either
are
you
truly
the
master
of
yourself
not
yet
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practice
on
the
fun
is
in
the
getting
there
i
have
admitted
that
i
am
not
the
master
of
my
thought
life
at
all
times
that
i
sometimes
say
things
i
do
want
to
say
and
then
repeat
my
mistake
unwantingly
i
have
admitted
to
myself
that
i
cannot
control
every
aspect
of
my
being
there
are
times
i
know
i
shouldnt
say
something
but
then
say
it
anyway
there
are
times
i
simply
forget
a
lesson
i
in
fact
am
not
my
own
master
we
dont
start
out
perfect
weve
got
to
strive
to
be
something
better
i
know
my
shortcomings
and
i
know
my
strengths
and
i
live
my
life
according
to
the
decisions
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
i
need
help
jesus
promised
me
this
help
and
i
took
him
up
on
his
offer
i
have
willfully
let
jesus
be
my
master
because
jesus
knows
what
is
better
for
me
than
i
myself
do
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
do
you
see
my
point
i
think
youre
the
one
under
the
rock
and
im
getting
a
great
tan
out
here
in
the
sunlight
my
life
has
improved
immesurably
since
i
abandoned
theism
come
and
join
me
it
will
be
a
difficult
trip
at
first
until
you
build
up
your
muscles
for
the
long
hike
but
its
well
worth
it
then
i
guess
ignorance
is
bliss
for
you
because
brian
you
enjoy
not
having
a
clue
about
the
bible
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
dont
you
see
im
not
going
to
accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my
own
eyes
or
experience
with
my
own
senses
especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
can
you
witness
motherly
love
with
your
senses
how
does
caring
and
concern
for
you
register
with
your
senses
if
nothing
registers
to
you
other
than
what
you
can
see
taste
smell
hear
and
touch
then
you
better
become
a
vulcan
and
fast
you
better
get
rid
of
your
emotions
huh
youre
going
way
off

track
here
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
my
god
says
that
you
will
not
cease
existing
you
have
life
forever
you
can
choose
to
either
live
it
in
hell
in
eternal
torment
where
there
is
no
communication
whatsoever
or
can
choose
to
live
it
in
paradise
with
god
that
is
what
my
god
says
and
that
was
the
issue
your
madeup
theism
is
what
it
ismade
up
its
wishful
thinking
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no

how
powerful
it

amusement
park
why
i
mean
after
a
few
hours
it
closes
and
nothings
different
except
that
youre
a
few
dollars
lighter
going
to
the
amusement
park
doesnt
do
you
any
good
at
all
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
the
answer
is
that
you
think
its
fun
you
play
the
skeeball
over
and
over
because
youd
like
to
get
better
at
it
even
though
youre
not
going
to
win
anything
better
than
a
stuffed
animal
even
if
you
blow
ten
dollars
on
it
you
ride
the
roller
coaster
because
its
an
thrilling
experience
even
though
because
it
scares
the
dickens
out
of
you
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
forget
the
bible
for
a
minute
forget
quoting
verses
forget
about
who
said
what
about
this
or
that
show
me
picture
just
you
and
me
and
a
wide
open
hilltop
and
convince
me
that
youre
right
forget
that
i
am
a
person
forget
that
i
know
how
to
type
forget
that
i
know
how
to
put
a
sentence
together
forget
that
i
know
how
to
send
email
forget
my
existence
proove
to
me
that
i
exist
i
cant
do
it
because
your
existence
means
nothing
more
to
me
than
just
your
communications
over
the
net
you
have
no
more
bearing
on
nor
importance
in
my
life
than
that
remove
it
and
you
will
cease
to
be
significant
to
me
are
you
thereby
inferring
that
your
deity
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
verses
in
a
book
and
cannot
be
supported
without
invoking
them
or
do
you
mean
that
the
existence
of
your
deity
and
in
fact
any
other
deity
that
can
be
written
about
is
as
real

your

i
learned
that
a

cannot
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his

death

because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling

requires

proven

by

are
not

salvation
is

i
responded
to

that
rw
i
dont
see
the
effort
to
equate
salvation
with

rw
rw
rather
i
see
implied
the
fact
that
only
those
who
are

rw
may
enter

to
which
kermit
wrote
kt
incomplete
reference
kt
kt
see
also
the
discussion
did
jesus
go
into

in
the
biblestudy

kt
for
the
arguments
that
paradise
and
hellsheol
are
places
after

kt
the
discussion
no
lds
were
involved
as
far
as
i
could
see
argued
using
kt
standard
christian
argument
from
the
bible
that
pretty
much
support
the
kt
lds
position
kt
kt
christ
went
to
paridise
after
his
death
and
burial
kt
kt
he
taught
the
prisoners
and
freed
them
from
darkness
kt
kt
when
he
was
resurrected
he
had
not
yet
ascended
to
his
father
kt
kt
the
arguement
centered
around
what
was
or
wasnt
the
proper
biblical
kt
terms
for
those
places
i
respond
the
question
that
was
raised
was
not
if
jesus
went
to
infernal
paradise
before
entering
into
heaven
no
one
has
made
a
point
for
or
against
that
issue
nor
have
they
compared
the
lds
position
against
orthodox
belief
the
infernal
paradise
is
held
to
be
abrahams
bosom
luke
the
place
of
the

dead
in
sheol
equivalent
to

the
point
that
was

by

was
that

could

welcomed

in

bearing

of

miracles
now
it
would
require
a
voluminous
work
to
mention
all
his
miracles
as
the
punctilious
scholars
have
written
many
volumes
concerning
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
here
we
will
briefly
point
out
only
the
general
category
into
which
fall
fhe
miracles
that
are
definite
and
accepted
as
accurate
reports
the
evidences
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
saw
fall
into
two
main
categories
the
first
is
called
irhasat
and
includes
the
paranormal
events
that
happened
at
the
time
of
his
birth
or
before
his
declaration
of
prophethood
the
second
group
pertains
to
all
the
remaining
evidences
of
the
prophethood
and
contains
two
subdivisions
those
wonders
that
were
manifested
after
his
departure
from
this
world
in
order
to
confirm
his
prophethood
and
those
that
he
exhibited
during
the
era
of
his
prophethood
the
latter
has
also
two
parts
the
evidences
of
his
prophethood
that
became
manifest
in
his
own
personality
his
inner
and
outer
being
his
moral
conduct
and
perfection
and
the
miracles
that
related
to
substantial
matters
the
last
part
again
has
two
branches
those
concerning
the
quran
and
spirituality
and
those
relating
to
matter
and
creation
this
last
branch
is
again
divided
into
two
categories
the
first
involves
the
paranormal
happenings
that
occured
during
his
mission
either
to
break
the
stubbornness
of
the
unbelievers
or
to
augment
the
faith
of
the
belivers
this
category
has
twenty
different
sorts
such
as
the
splitting
of
the
moon
the
flowing
of
water
from
the
fingers
the
satisfying
of
large
numbers
with
a
little
food
and
the
speaking
of
trees
rocks
and
animals
each
of
these
sons
has
also
many
instances
and
thus
has
in
meaning

question
is
on
what
authority
do
we
proclaim
that
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
commandment
are
no
longer
relevant
to
modern
christians
please
i
dont
believe
most
christians
believe
they
are
above
the
law
however
we
are
not
saved
by
adherence
to
the
law
the
law
exists
to
tell
us
what
is
sinful
we
all
sin
hence
we
are
all
above
the
law
where
all
in
this
case
refers
to
christians
jews
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
with
blood
sacrifice
of
animals
as
described
in
the
old
testament
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
about
a
jewish
animal
sacrifice
christians
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
by
the
blood
sacrifice
of
jesus
the
blood
sacrifice
of
an
innocent
man
this
does
not
make
the
law
irrelevant
then
why
dont
christians
follow
it
why
dont
they
even
follow
their
own
ten
commandments
breaking
the
law
is
sinful
and
we
are
to
avoid
sinful
ways
but
sinning
by
itself
does
not
jeopardize
salvation
so
in
short
hitler
is
in
heaven
and
gandhi
is
in
hell
note
that
im
not
a

this
is
the
gist
of
several
sermons
ive

kevin
osinski
writes
i
recall
reading
in
michael
rutherfords
novel
sarum
a
scene
in
which
the
son
of
a
roman
nobleman
living
in
britain
takes
part
in
a
secret
ceremony
involving
a
bull
he
stands
naked
in
a
pit
covered
with
some
sort
of
scaffolding
while
assistants
coax
a
bull
to
stand
on
the
scaffolding
they
then
fatally
stab
the
bull
which
douses
the
worshipper
in
the
pit
with
blood
this
is
supposedly
some
sort
of
rite
of
passage
for
members
of
the
bull
cult
i
wonder
if
this
is
related
to
the
mithras
cult
i
dont
know
where
rutherford
got
his
information
for
this
chapter
the
book
is
historical
fiction
and
most
of
the
general
events
which
take
place
are
largely
based
on
historical
accounts
there
is
a
rite
like
this
described
in
joseph
campbells
occidentalmythology
he
also
described
levels
of
initiation
i
think
i
dont
know
where
campbell
got
his
info
but
i
remember
thinking
he
was
being
a
little
eclectic
i
also
wonder
what
if
any
connection
there
is
between
the
ancient
bull
cults
and
the
current
practice
of
bullfighting
popular
in
some
mediterranean
cultures
quite

we
have

inside
im
not
that
annoyed
about
the
adults
they
knew
supposedly
what
they
were
doing
and
its
their

what
i
mostly
are
angry
about
is
the
fact
that
the
people
inside
including
mothers
let
the
children
suffer
and
die
during
awful
conditions
if
this
is
considered
religious
following
to
the
end
im
proud
that
i
dont

fanatical

noncompassionate
religions
you
might
want
to

for

purpose

jesus
had

so
the

were

jesus
knew

i

i
come

thank

i
really

ill
try

at

i
have
also
learned

respond

others
respond
only
at
a
harsh
rebuke
brian

so
far
only
responds

and
i
am
glad
he
responds
at
all
in
both
cases
of

my

if
i

i
apologize

brian

i
know
this

brian

vasillates
back

one
post
looks
honest
the
next
is
an
excuse
now
he
wants
me
to
explain
the
universe
in
words
or
less
i
think
brian
kendig
is
really
trying
but
he
is
too
comfortable
with
his
set
of
excuses
i
just
want
brian
k
to
be
honest
with
himself
if
he
really
wants
to
know
he
will
ask
questions
and
stop
asserting
irrelevant
excuses
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
god
i
wish
brian
would
read
the
bible
for
himself
and
come
to
his
own
decisions
without
being
sidetracked
with
the
temptation
to
mock
god
from
my
perspective
rob
when
i
look
at
brian
kendig
i
see
a
man
standing
out
in
the
middle
of
a
highway
off
into
the
distance
i
see
a
mack
truck
heading
right
for
him
but
brian
k
is
faced
away
from
the
oncoming
truck
he
doesnt
see
it
heres
is
how
i
see
the
dialog
me
brian
k
please
step
aside
before
you
get
run
over
bk
there
is
no
truck
me
turn
around
at
look
bk
no
me
look
you
will
be
healthier
if
you
do
take
a
look
at
the
oncoming
truck
bk
no
explain
to
me
why
trucks
exist
me
turn
around
or
you
will
run
over
bk
no
i
wont
because
i
like
hiking
and
tomorrow
is
tuesday
me
you
blind
fool
why
do
you
choose
ignorance
you
have
nothing
to
lose
if
you
look
but
if
do
not
look
you
will
certainly
lose
your
life
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
squashed
all
over
the
road
bk
it
is
my
life
to
lose
i
rather
not
look
besides
a
truck
running
over
me
will
not
harm
me
and
by
the
way
i
really
have
an
open
mind
so
is
my
motivation
to
belittle
brian
or
to
love
brian
the
best
i
know
how
i
do
not
wish
to
single
brian
kendig
out
because
millions
if
not
billions
of
people
fall
into
the

category
perhaps
all
people
fall
have
fallen
into
this
category
at
one
time
in
their
lives
i
have
i
can
now
see
the
truck
behind
brian
my
hope
is
that
brian
will
look
and
will
see
the
ramifications
of
the
truck
coming
towards
him
my
hope
is
that
brian
will
want
to
step
out
of
the
way
my
fear
though
is
that
brian
will
instead
choose
to
glue
himself
to
the
middle
of
the
highway
where
he
will
certainly
get
run
over
but
if
he
so
chooses
he
so
chooses
and
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
beyond
that
to
change
his
mind
for
it
is
his
choice
but
at
this
very
moment
brian
hasnt
gotten
even
that
far
he
is
still
at
the
point
where
he
does
not
want
to
look
sure
he
moves
his
eyeball
to
appease
me
but
his
head
will
not
turn
around
to
see
the
entire
picture
so
far
he
is
satisfied
with
his
glimpse
of
the
mountains
off
in
the
distance
thank
you
again

your
reproach

by
repenting

repentance
is

it

faith

by

such

certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
john
most
assuredly
i
say
to
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
falls
onto
the
ground
and
dies
it
remains
alone
but
if
it
dies
it
produces
much
grain
he
who
loves
his
life
will
lose
it
and
he
who
hates
his
life
in
this
world
will
keep
it
for
eternal
life
if
anyone
serves
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
my
servant
will
be
also
if
anyone
serves
me
him
my
father
will
honor
why
would
i
want
an
eternal
life
if
i
hate
this
one
if
we
were
created
by
a
deity
why
would
that
deity
not
wish
us
to
enjoy
what
he
has
given
us
why
would
i
want
to
live
forever
the
challenge
in
my
life
is
that
i
will
die
and
that
i
must
give
my
life
the
meaning
i
wish
it
to
have
before
that
happens
my
time
is
here
and
will
someday
pass
i
will
be
content
to
live
on
in
the
memories
of
my
friends
and
once
they
too
are
dead
then
i
will
no
longer
have
any
reason
to
exist
in
short
even
if
your
deity
does
exist
that
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
because
of
my
actions
and
my
choices
if
your
god
decides
to
toss
me
into
a
flaming
pit
for
this
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
cease
to
exist
but
if
your
god
wants
my
respect
and
my
obedience
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
does
then
they
will
be
very
strong
and
true
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
jesus
wasnt
the
only
one
who
rose
from
the
dead
i
think
it
was
osiris
who
did
the
same
as
well
as
a
few
characters
from
greek
or
norse
legend
if
memory
serves
but
still
why
would
i
want
to
rise
from
the
dead
why
do
you
want
to
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
if
your
god
wants
to
win
my
devotion
then
it
knows
what
it
can
do
provide
some
way
for
me
to
believe
without
having
to
resort
to
blind
faith
that
could
be
applied
equally
well
to
any
religion
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the
world
cannot
accept
him
because
it
neither
sees
him
nor
knows
him
john
thats
precisely
it
i
neither
see
nor
know
zeus
either
nor
odin
shall
i
offer
them
the
same
devotion
i
offer
jesus
the
animosity
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
that
comes
out
in
your
twistings
of
roberts
daily
verses
is
very
convincing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
john
and
youve
got
to
understand
my
pointofview
i
see
christians
spouting
bible
verse
all
the
time
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic
spell
that
will
level
all
opposition
truth
is
its
not
robert
has
never
demonstrated
that
he
actually
understands
what
the
verses
imply
he
just
rattles
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenly
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense
and
reality
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
but
even
more
than
that
even
when
christians
do
try
to
explain
the
verses
in
their
own
words
they
do
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
which
is
that
every
human
being
would
want
to
be
a
christian
if
only
he
or
she
understood
the
christian
message
properly
and
then
all
strife
and
suffering
on
the
earth
would
end
heres
the
problem
with
that
substitute
moslem
or
buddhist
or
satanist
instead
of
christian
and
it
means
the
same
thing
christanity
is
a
very
nice
belief
set
around
a
very
nice
book
but
if
you
want
to
make
me
believe
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
real
world
youve
got
some
convincing
to
do
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animosity
and
lack
of
knowledge
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesus
revealed
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbling
about
blindly
though
arrogantly
slandering
the
very
person
who
created
me
and
who
loves
me
and
in
my
opinion
youre
bumbling
about
blindly
making
up
entities
where
there
arent
any
and
depriving
yourself
of
a
true
understanding
and
enjoyment
of
your
life
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beliefs
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
beliefs
to
myself
but
as
soon
as
you
start
waving
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinions

hi
all
im
going
to
try
to
do
something
here
that
perhaps
many
would
not
have
thought
even
possible
i
want
to
begin
the
process
of
initiating
a
literary
critical
study
of
the
pornography
posted
on
altsexstories
to
identify
the
major
themes
and
motifs
present
in
the
stories
posted
there
opening
up
then
the
possibility
of
an
objective
moral
evaluation
of
the
material
present
there
first
off
let
me
congratulate
you
for
not
posting
a
flame
about
you
sick
perverts
you
are
immoral
you
are
all
going
to
hell
which
seems
to
be
the
usual
religious
post
found
on
the
altsex
hierarchy
hopefully
you
wont
get
flamed
either
you
will
however
be
argued
with
i
personally
think
that
your
project
is
built
on
unsteady
ground
first
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
way
to
find
an
objective
morality
morality
and
value
are
inherently
subjective
they
represent
the
beliefs
of
a
person
or
a
group
of
people
they
can
be
widely
held
perhaps
even
overwhelmingly
held
but
they
are
never
and
can
never
be
objective
assumptions
a
christian
bedrock
assumption
that
all
that
is
true
comes
truly
from
god
regarding
altsexstories
while
perhaps
even
from
an
objective
standpoint
the
majority
of
its
material
is
indeed
repugnant
you
come
to
this
conclusion
quite
quickly
when
you
start
thinking
about
analyzing
its
material
like
this
some
of
it
reflects
some
fairly
profound
needs
in
people
as
well
as
some
truths
and
deserve
to
be
pointed
out
second
i
do
not
accept
the
assumptions
that
you
make
here
if
as
you
say
you
are
trying
to
be
objective
then
why
accept
a
morality
to
begin
with
by
using
the
christian
bible
youre
defeating
your
own
purpose
by
doing
so
in
the
long
run
the
advantage
of
making
such
a
literarymoral
analysis
is
that
it
will
save
bandwidth
between
christians
and
non
mutually
flaming
each
other
about
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
stuff
on
these
pornographic
groups
third
call
me
a
pessimist
but
you
wont
stop
the
flamage
there
will
always
be
people
who
pop
upin
altsex
to
tell
us
how
sick
and
twisted
and
evil
we
all
are
just
out
of
curiosity
do
altsex
readers
show
up
unprovoked
in
the
religion
groups
to
tell
you
all
that
you
are
narrowminded
censoring
overbearing
totalitarianists
basically
there
should
not
be
a
dissonance
between
a
christian
morality
and
a
nonchristian
one
either
there
is
value
in
a
particular
work
or
there
is
not
whether
one
is
a
christian
or
not
hm
let
me
provide
an
example
four
people
get
together
over
dinner
to
discuss
morality
you
me
a
rather
conservative
moslem
and
a
sociopath
i
start
off
by
saying
that
i
think
its
immoral
to
force
people
to
have
sex
with
you
you
agree
but
also
say
that
it
is
immoral
to
have
sex
with
someone
of
your
own
gender
just
a
note
i
really
dont
know
your
views
on
homosexuality
i
am
just
using
this
as
a
common
view
of
morality
for
the
purposes
of
this
example
the
moslem
says
that
it
is
immoral
for
women
to
have
their
faces
uncovered
the
sociopath
who
has
become
bored
kills
all
three
of
us
and
eats
us
but
feels
no
guilt
because
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
morally
in
his
own
mind
in
support
for
the
first
assumption
the
christian
scriptures
say
this
evidence
deleted
im
not
going
to
accept
your
evidence
for
this
you
ask
us
to
accept
the
word
of
god
that
everything
good
comes
from
god
this
is
only
a
valid
argument
for
a
person
who
shares
your
beliefs
still
i
must
say
that
cataloging
the
major
themes
and
motifs
in
erotica
could
be
interesting
for
other
reasons
than
yours
so
good
luck
with
this
next
part
now
then
what
are
some
of
the
major
themesmotifs
in
the
pornographic
literature
on
places
like
altsexstories
these
are
some
that
ive
been
able
to
identify
please
addcomment
on
them
motif
the
malecinderella
in
so
many
of
the
stories
there
is
expressed
a
feeling
of
alienation
and
worthlessness
on
the
part
of
the
writer
or
otherwise
protagonist
of
the
story
with
regard
to
the
object
the
other
person
of
hisher
desire
often
a
story
involves
a
protagonist
who
on
the
surface
is
quite
average
but
underneath
usually
has
an
enormous
dick
who
desires
to
in
some
way
to
gain
access
in
a
definitely
sexual
way
to
the
other
person
who
heshe
confesses
is
far
more
desireable
than
heshe
is
and
who
indeed
seems
to
walk
between
the
raindrops
hmmmdo
i
detect
just
a
wee
bit
of
condescence
here
motif
a
celebration
of
indeed
preoccupation
with
beauty
not
very
objective
the
vast
majority
of
pornographic
literature
deals
with
beauty
be
it
innocence
somehow
about
to
be
lost
grace
or
simply
physical
beauty
and
generally
most
people
christian
or
non
will
say
that
beauty
is
good
one
could
construe
this
to
mean
that
beautiful
people
are
better
or
more
good
than
nonbeautiful
people
i
would
hope
that
people
relize
that
this
is
not
necessarily
true
motif
ones
dick
is
ones
instrument
of
redemption
might
i
suggest
the
word
penis
it
seems
more
in
line
with
the
tone
of

laid

thus
be

matthew
bravo
i
respect
you
and
your
sense
of
humor
sir
motif
sex
as
an
expression
of
sincere
giving
there
is
often
enough
a
clear
desire
on
the
part
of
the
protagonist
to
give
definitely
sexual
pleasure
to
the
object
person
of
hisher
desires

and
this
theme
is
usually
what
the
better
stories
are
about
however
they
are
not
always
selfish
i
could
point
to
examples
in
the
work
of
elf
sternberg
for
example
motif
altsexstories
describes
a
sex
which
is
completely
removed
from
the
realm
of
transmitting
life
so
removed
is
sex
from
its
procreative
dimension
on
altsexstories
that
one
begins
to
wonder
why
sex
even
involves
ejaculation
as
in
the
context
described
in
pornography
it
serves
then
no
real
purpose
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
it
does
in
pornographic
movies
it
affirms
the
virility
of
the
male
involved
as
well
as
assuring
the
reader
that
he
the
character
has
orgasmed
the
whole
picture
tm
is
probably
very
well
described
by
the
catholic
teaching
on
this
of
the
husband
and
wife
in
an
act
of
total
mutual
selfgiving
in
the
sexual
union
cooperating
with
god
in
opening
themselves
up
for
the
transmission
of
new
life
cf
humane
vitae
your
whole
picture
tm
unfortunately
only
applies
to
people
who
accept
your
church
in
addition
if
sex
is
for
procreation
then
why
did
god
make
it
pleasurable
so
that
people
would
want
to
do
it
rather
than
building
it
in
as
instinct
why
did
god
make
it
fallible
not
every
sexual
encounter
results
in
pregnancy
even
among
catholics
does
this
mean
that
they
have
sinned
in
any
case
altsexstories
and
the
catholic
teaching
will
probably
not
see
eye
to
eye
on
this
for
a
long
time
granted
motif
sex
used
as
an
instrument
violence
power
and
humiliation
why
pornography
seems
to
tend
in
that
direction
i
really
do
not
know
probably
volumes
could
be
written
on
the
relationships
between
sex
and
powerhumiliation
but
this
probably
gives
good
reason
why
traditionally
judeochristianity
has
been
so
negative
with
regard
to
sexuality
it
seems
to
tend
to
a
great
moral
morass
pornography
would
not
tend
in
those
directions
if
there
were
not
a
demand
for
it
many
people
have
violent
fantasies
that
they
would
never
act
out
in
real
life
but
will
think
about
and
read
about
and
mull
over
later

writes
for
those
missing
the
context
of
this
thrilling
discussion
between
jim
and
i
jim
wrote
the
following
to
me
in
email
after
i
pointed
out
hate
to
shatter
your
self
image
of
perfection
that
you
appear
to
hold
but
your
language
is
wrong
jim
and
me
i
pointed
out
that
i
did
in
fact
agree
that
both
robert
weiss
and
jim
meritt
took
quotes
out
of
context
hence
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
jim
thinks
i
am
a
hypocrite
needless
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
reply
to
every
article
on
trm
that
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
of
course
not
just
the
ones
you
disagree
with
qed
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
jim
replied
by
saying
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articles
from
jim
one
of
which
has
the
subject
so
as
of
then
and
pointing
out
a
specific
instance
wrongo
again
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
when
someone
is
aware
of
something
and
has
the
capability
of
taking
action
and
does
not
that
individual
may
be
held
responsible
for
that
action
which
is
of
course
a
complete
red
herring
taking
quotes
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
every
article
on
trm
and
im
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
reply
to
them
all
so
check
the
newsgroups
does
silence
is
concurrence
imply
that
jim
thinks
that
because
i
didnt
respond
to
weiss
articles
i
must
condone
weiss
taking
quotes
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
this
question
read
what
he
has
written
and
decide
for
yourself
telepathy
again
you
claim
to
know
what
i
want
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
conversation
with
jim
jims
next
gambit
was
to
claim
that
he
was
using
inductive
logic
when
he
concluded
that
i
was
being
a
hypocrite
i
challenged
him
to
provide
the
details
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclusion
no
you
asked
specifically
what
was
wrong
with
yours
today
we
find
another
obscure
article
posting
it
twice
didnt
help
maybe
to
the
ignorant
i
accept
your
classification
more
red
herrings
could
jim
mean
that
he
has
read
an
uncountably
large
number
of
my
articles
do
you
know
what
uncountably
large
means
it
does
not
appear
so
could
jim
mean
that
because
i
axed
his
articles
but
not
weiss
articles
he
wants
to
conclude
inductively
well
i
cant
see
where
he
is
going
with
this
i
am
not
suprised
but
i
can
help
him
with
his
induction
ive
written
roughly
that
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
the
appearance
of
your
argument
is
more
like
that
captain
kirk
would
have
gotten
from
mr
spock
written
by
a
stagehand
at
paramount
think
hard
about
this
jim
see
the
pattern
think
harder
run
it
through
your
induction
engine
and
see
what
pops
out
of
course
you
appear
arrogant

subject
re
christian
metaethics
in
article
mlspanixcom
michael
siemon
writes
well
the
whole
point
of
making
these
the
base
commandments
is
that
they
arent
reducible
to
rules
a
set
of
rules
is
a
moral
code
or
a
law
code
or
an
algorithm
for
acting
such
things
can
be
very
helpful
to
individuals
or
societies
but
not
if
they
are
used
instead
of
a
personal
involvement
in
and
responsibility
for
ones
actions
the
two
commandments
are
rules
they
are
merely
rules
that
are
so
vague
that
they
are
practically
devoid
of
meaning
michael
siemon
acknowledges
this
every
time
he
writes
that
the
resolution
of
an
argument
over
them
turns
on
secular
and
cultural
assumptions
that
are
independent
of
these
rules
the
great
commandment
is
more
than
anything
else
a
call
to
act
as
if
you
were
god
and
accepting
ultimate
responsibility
in
your
every
action
the
commandment
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
can
be
viewed
in
part
as
reminding
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
cannot
act
as
if
he
has
ultimate
responsibility
indeed
many
traditions
present
an
interpretation
where
believers
are
supposed
to
interpret
loving
ones
neighbor
as
following
various
other
rules
and
relying
on
their
god
to
make
things
come
out
right
precisely
because
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assume
such
ultimate
responsibility
once
again
we
are
confronted
with
good
sounding
goo
that
means
whatever
the
reader
wants
it
to
mean
conservatives
may
twist
this
act
as
if
you
were
god
to
mean
lay
down
rules
for
other
people
and
be
as
nasty
to
them
as
possible
if
they
dont
keep
your
rules
they
are
so
insistent
and
obvious
about
this
that
they
have
convinced
a
lot
of
people
who
rightly
reject
the
whole
concept
that
such
idiocy
is
how
god
acts
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
michael
cannot
refer
to
base
claims
or
base
commandments
to
show
that
such
readings
are
twisted
because
this
divergence
in
understanding
occurs
even
in
trying
to
interpret
the
base
claims
and
commandments
in
addressing
conservative
christians
michael
will
necessarily
draw
upon
secular
and
cultural
notions
that
these
conservative
christians
will
reject
but
why
should
anyone
be
looking
for
an
ethical
system
since
our
society
is
eager
to
hand
us
one
or
more
no
matter
what
we
do
it
may
be
that
we
need
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
in
which
case
i
will
profer
the
agapate
allelou
once
again
but
these
base
commandments
are
too
vague
to
serve
as
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
the
meaning
of
these
base
commandments
for
any
believer
derives
from
the
secular
and
cultural
notions
that
the
believer
brings
to
them
from
how
the
believer
mixes
their
demands
with
straightforward
readings
of
other
biblical
passages
from
a
particular
sectarian
tradition
or
from
some
combination
of
these
things
these
commandments
lack
sufficient
substance
in
themself
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
criticizing
ethical
systems
what
meaning
they
have
comes
from
the
ethical
system
the
believer
brings
to
these
commandments
and
different
bodies
of
christians
have
from
the
beginning
urged
different
ethical
systems
or
in
some
cases
none
as
a
result
it
is
bizarre
to
identify
any
one
of
these
systems
however
popular
or
infamous
with
christianity
christianity
does
not
have
a
torah
it
does
not
have
a
quran
specifically
christian
scripture
has
very
little
if
anything
in
the
way
of
commandments
so
little
that
the
christians
who
desperately
want
commandments
go
mining
for
them
with
almost
no
support
the
one
single
thing
in
the
gospels
which
jesus
specifically
gives
as
a
commandment
to
us
is
love
one
another
jesus
explicitly
states
that
this
summarizes
jewish
law
which
would
seem
to
bring
in
all
of
it
if
we
properly
understand
what
it
means
to
love
god
and
love
our
neighbors
there
are
many
parables
and
teachings
the
gospels
attribute
to
jesus
that
are
straightforwardly
read
as
ethical
commandments
the
pauline
epistles
are
similarly
full
if
it
is
not
clear
that
these
all
come
together
in
a
sensible
understanding
of
ethical
behavior
the
problem
is
not
a
lack
of
raw
material
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
seriously
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the
gospel
seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
tell
you
something
about
christianity
in
a
sense
the
wide
variety
of
interpretations
does
tell
us
something
about
christianity
it
tells
us
that
the
new
testament
authors
left
a
sufficiently
vague
hodgepodge
that
it
can
serve
as
the
source
text
for
many
vastly
different
beliefs
about
the
nature
of
the
christian
god
and
about
what
men
should
and
shouldnt
do
the
irony
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
christianity
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
cause
of
lesbians
and
gays
every
christian
principle
he
turns
to
this
cause
is
effective
only
through
the
extrachristian
principles
through
which
michael
interprets
his
religion
and
the
homophobes
apply
the
same
christian
principles
with
equal
justification
to
their
cause
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
michael
paints
a
picture
of
standard
american
atheism
as
the
rejection
of
the
evil
in
many
conservative
christian
interpretations
of
the
bible
but
i
think
it
is
even
more
damaging
to
christianity
to
note
that
the
new
testament
presents
such
a
vague
hodgepodge
of
notions
about
the
nature
of
god
and
the
nature
of
the
good
except
of
course
when
it
is
ordered
by
an
interpretation
that
relies
on
extraneous
principles
here
i
think
we
should
apply
a
christian
parable
where
a
cold
drink
can
have
its
value
and
a
hot
drink
can
have
its
value

this
passage
the
messenger
from
god
speaks
of
how
he
fought
for
weeks
against
the
prince
of
the
persian
kingdom
obviously
this
prince
was
not
an
earthly
prince
this
prince
of
the
persian
kingdom
is
probably
one
of
the
demons
in
satans
hierarchy
as
such
the
morning
star
can
be
the
prince
of
babylon
w
ho
can
also
be
satan
another
passage
concerning
satans
fall
from
heaven
is
ezekiel
and
separately
devil
chose
to
try
to
become
greater
than
god
he
wanted
to
sit
on
gods
throne
when
the
devil
was
created
he
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
angels
in
heaven
we
have
here
three
distinct
claims
concerning
the
results
of
the
devils
decision
making
a
specific
desire
and
a
physical
description
now
in
support
aside
from
the
minor
detail
that
an
author
seldom
writes
an
unbiased
account
of
the
opposition
we
see
isaiah
isa
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
how
art
thou
cut
down
to
the

which
didst
weaken

isa

anyway
i
dont
have
anything
against
amorc
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
secret
organizations
are
lead
by
human
beings
and
we
all
know
what
that
means
i
had
an
ehum
interesting
experience
with
the
rosicrucians
or
at
least
rosicrucians
of
some
sort
last
sunday
they
had
advertised
that
they
were
holding
a
lecture
titled
the
graal
of
the
king
the
room
of
the
heart
which
rhymes
in
swedish
out
of
curiosity
i
went
to
the
lecture
there
were
four
people
there
apart
from
the
two
rosicrucians
one
woman
and
two
men
apart
from
me
the
rosicrucians
were
male
both
of
them
first
one
of
them
told
us
about
the
rosicrucians
and
lectorium
rosicrucianum
which
was
founded
in
harlem
nl
in
he
read
straight
from
a
piece
of
paper
which
i
at
that
point
was
because
he
lacked
experience
in
talking
in
front
of
people
but
the
other
guy
read
too
and
he
was
used
to
holding
speeches
i
could
tell
the
first
guy
also
said
that
the
rs
are
a
mystical
christian
order
and
that
they
base
their
teachings
on
the
teachings
of
the
kathars
english
from
the
thirteenth
century
the
other
guy
took
over
reading
from
his
piece
of
paper
in
a
fairytale
tellers
voice
what
he
said
sounded
like
a
load
of
crap
to
me
of
course
that
might
be
because
i
am
unenlightened
or
something
what
made
me
a
bit
suspicious
was
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contained
something
divine
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divinity
then
that
we
couldnt
become
divine
as
the
persons
we
are
currently
but
if
we
worked
really
hard
we
would
reach
eternal
bliss
maybe
ive
read
too
much
raw
but
it
sounded
very
much
like
the
things
he
talks
about
in
the
chapter
how
to
robotize
people
and
brainwash
your
friends
in
prometheus
rising
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
the
two
rosicrucians
the
one
holding
the
actual
lecture
obviously
was
top
dog
and
the
other
one
seemed
to
be
a
true
believer
i
got
the
impression
that
the
top
dog
had
more
distance
to
the
faith
than
the
true
believer
that
he
used
it
to
gain
power
and
admiration
he
spoke
like
a

he

re
christian
metaethics
i
wrote
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
in
article
dave
davis
writes
this
requires
the
assumption
that
all
interpretations
are
equally
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reasonably
distinguishing
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumption
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
no
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
most
christians
choice
of
interpretation
stems
from
a
mix
of
beliefs
that
are
influenced
by
the
secular
ethics
of
their
culture
and
that
are
not
fully
determined
by
scripture
whether
or
not
there
is
some
right
interpretation
matters
not
few
christians
claim
the
ability
to
read
the
mind
of
their
god
dave
davis
should
note
that
it
was
michael
who
first
stated
the
importance
of
secular
and
cultural
influence
in
this
thread
i
think
michael
is
right
in
this
but
regardless
it
should
be
noted
that
this
has
not
been
a
point
of
contention
between
michael
and
myself
i
have
argued
beyond
michaels
claims
that
the
christian
scriptures
are
open
to
so
many
interpretations
including
a
wide
divergence
within
the
christian
tradition
that
even
their
most
important
themes
are
vague
again
it
does
not
matter
that
there
is
some
right
interpretation
unless
there
is
a
way
to
determine
what
that
right
interpretation
is
it
is
the
lack
of
an
objective
measure
not
the
presumed
lack
of
an
answer
that
puts
the
force
behind
the
line
i
argue
michael
and
i
and
others
read
the
bible
with
christian
glasses
among
the
things
that
this
should
imply
is
that
the
nt
informs
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
dominanting
it
some
points
in
the
ot
ceremonial
dietary
laws
are
explicitly
abrogated
by
the
nt
texts
there
are
enough
christian
glasses
varying
over
a
sufficiently
broad
range
of
color
that
i
can
find
a
few
that
support
my
example
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the
gospel
seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
russell
turpins
no
here
is
misplaced
not
to
say
inappropriate
michaels
selfdescription
must
govern
the
equation
of
radical
liberal
which
seems
implied
by
russell
turpin
is
wrong
in
my
opinion
what
makes
michael
radical
is
that
he
fully
acknowledges
that
christian
scripture
and
tradition
fail
to
determine
the
doctrines
that
so
many
branches
within
christianity
hold
dear
he
is
willing
to
live
and
practice
his
religion
within
this
indeterminacy
and
he
is
willing
to
acknowledge
that
much
of
his
understanding
of
things
christian
is
influenced
by
ideas
that
are
not
purely
christian
those
christians
i
have
called
conservative
must
also
interpret
but
they
do
not
recognize
or
at
least
are
unwilling
to
admit
the
extent
and
importance
of
this
russell
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michaels
theological
positions
actually
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christianity
dean
simeon
responds
this
time
gently
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhaps
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibly
mean
the
implied
rhetorical
effort
to
separate
michael
from
the
tradition
is
a
failure
michael
is
in
the
tradition
if
your
idea
of
the
tradition
doesnt
include
him
change
your
idea
of
the
tradition
i
recognize
that
michael
is
part
of
the
tradition
but
what
does
it
tell
one
about
a
tradition
covering
origen
aquinas
jerry
fallwell
and
jesse
jackson
that
it
also
includes
michael
siemon
not
very
much
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
this
conclusion
does
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goes
before
a
surprising
logical
ellipsis
i
think
the
conclusion
does
follow
the
purely
christian
principles
that
michael
has
are
the
ones
he
shares
with
others
in
the
christian
tradition
or
that
can
be
derived
from
christian
scripture
these
necessarily
vague
are
not
enough
to
drive
his
political
stances
that
one
should
love
ones
neighbor
is
a
purely
christian
principle
that
this
means
showing
tolerance
for
homosexuality
is
not
as
to
these
political
stances
they
are
often
at
odds
with
what
is
commonly
held
in
most
of
current
christendom
and
so
i
suspect
they
could
be
better
pressed
outside
it
on
the
other
hand
i
can
well
understand
the
counterpoint
that
these
political
stances
become
most
influential
when
presented
to
those
who
need
them
most
this
is
a
theological
statement
worthy
of

turpin

the

gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age

sin
is
no

immediately

death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not

for

salvation
is
available

alike
sorry
if
this
is
late

i

was

be
constant

neverchanging
how
do
you
reconcile
this
common
christian
view
with
the
paragraph
above
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind
and
loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
does
this
an
admission
on
his
part
of
having
made
a
mistake
now
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an

tis
someone
just
told
me
that
the
old
testament
books
were
translated
into
greek
a
long
time
ago
yes
thats
a
famous
version
called
the
septuagint
it
was
a
translation
made
by
greek
jews
and
that
the
originals
were
destroyed
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
no
i
dont
know
what
youre
referring
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
temple
was
destroyed
some
manuscripts
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscripts
are
as
good
as
our
greek
ones
i
dont
know
about
any
originals
the
person
who
was
telling
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greeks
had
a
wonderful
library
in
alexandria
that
was
full
of
manuscriptsscrolls
and
that
it
was
burned
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
was
translated
perhaps
to
conceal
some
changes
in
the
different
versions
or
perhaps
just
as
part
of
the
typical
burning
of
valuable
things
that
occurs
during
changes
in
power
groups
hei
dunno
no
the
library
at
alexandria
was
perhaps
the
greatest
library
ever
built
in
the
world
the
greeks
had
a
love
of
wisdom
philo
sophos
and
this
great
love
was
reflected
in
the
alexandrian
library
the
christians
got
a
hold
of
it
and
began
modifying
and
purging
texts
and
then
the
moslems
invaded
and
either
the
christians
burned
the
library
to
keep
it
from
falling
into
moslems
hands
far
more
likely
since
they
were
the
book
burners
not
the
moslems
or
it
burned
in
the
sack
of
the
city
or
the
moslems
burned
it
either
way
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
was
lost
the
destruction
of
the
library
of
alexandria
was
probably
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
of
man
against
man
so
i
was
just
wondering
since
i
imagine
some
jewish
people
somewhere
must
have
had
copies
of
the
earlier
hebrew
versions
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
very
different
from
the
greek
derived
version
no
there
are
a
few
famous
discrepancies
isaiahs
prophecy
about
a
young
woman
was
changed
into
a
virgin
which
was
how
the
new
testament
writers

the

was
translated

the

parthenos
which
may
or
may
not
be
correctly
translated
into

virgin
the

did
not
have
the

cult
that

this
is

then

if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstore
youll
get
a
bible
translated
by
jews
so
there
will
be
some
differences
in
interpretation
but
the
text
theyre
translating
from
is
basically
the
same
the
standard
text
used
by
christians
and
jews
is
the
masoretic
text
jews
of
course
use
the
text
in
its
original
hebrew
without
translation
if
you
want
to
read
the
original
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bible
that
contains
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translation
written
underneath
each
word
if
you
want
a
bible
with

you
can
try

alexander

many

given
the

if
they

then
they
are

matthew
right
if
they
have

and
accepted
jesus
christ
as
their

then
they
are

um
where
did
jesus

that
he
wanted

sandvik

hmm
it
seems
that
this
is
the
core
of
christianity
then
you
have
to
feel
guilty
i
think
i
see
where
you
are
coming
from
kent
jesus
doesnt
view
guilt
like
our
modern
venacular
colors
it
feelings
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
feelings
arise
from
the
state
of
being
guilty
feeling
and
guilt
are
mutally
exclusive
feelings
are
a
reaction
from
guilt
jesus
is
talking
about
the
guilt
state
not
the
reaction
let
me
give
you
an
example
have
you
ever
made
a
mistake
have
you
ever
lied
to
someone
even
a
little
white
lie
have
you
ever
claimed
to
know
something
that
you
really
didnt
know
have
you
ever
hated
someone
have
you
ever
been
selfish
are
you
guilty
of
any
one
of
these
the
answer
is
of
course
yes
you
are
guilty
period
that
is
it
what
jesus
is
getting
at
no
big
surprise
feelings
do
not
even
enter
the
picture
consider
jesuss
use
of
the
word
guilt
as
how
a
court
uses
it
jesus
is
concerned
that
everyone
should
admit
that
they
are
guilty
of
being
imperfect
the
bible
calls
it
the
state
that
we
are
all
sinners
we
all
do
bad
things
even
the
most
insignficant
thing
that
we
do
wrong
is
proof
of
our
guilt
that
we
are
all
sinners
it
is
it
in
our
nature
to
do
bad
things
we
are
sinners
therefore
we
do
bad
things
being
a
sinner
is
fact
it
is
not
a
pleasant
fact
but
it
is
just
a
fact
we
are
not
perfect
calling
us
sinners
should
have
no
more
emotional
charge
to
you
than
calling
you
a
human
being
guilty
as
charged
and
then
theres
this
single
personality
that
will
save
you
from
this
universal
guilt
feeling
you
can
handle
your
guilt
in
one
of
two
ways
acknowledge
you
made
a
mistake
learn
from
it
and
try
to
not
do
it
againin
the
meantime
not
punishing
yourself
for
it
which
is
the
way
jesus
wants
you
to
handle
or
it
this
is
the
healthy
way
or
two
the
destructive
way
put
yourself
down
slap
yourself
and
feel
like
crap
never
forgive
yourself
force
yourself
to
say
a
thousand
hail
marys
even
to
suicide
this
the
way
jesus
does
not
want
us
to
deal
with
it
all
people
fall
into
this
category
to
some
extent
in
their
lives
jesus
is
not
in
the
business
of
saving
us
from
this
guilt
feeling
jesus
is
in
the
business
of
showing
us
how
much
he
loves
us
despite
our
guilt
jesus
knows
we
are
guilty
that
isnt
new
to
him
it
is
no
big
deal
to
him
he
just
wants
you
to
realize
that
this
sinful
nature
destroys
the
relationship
between
you
and
him
that
is
what
he
wants
you
to
know
why
because
he
wants
to
have
your
company
you
are
immensely
valuable
to
him
jesus
wants
a
relationship
with
you
however
in
our
present
sinful
nature
we
are
incapable
of
having
this
relationship
god
is
perfect
we
are
not
you
cannot
fit
a
square
peg
into
a
round
hole
however
god
has
provided
a
way
for
us
to
change
our
nature
so
that
we
can
have
a
relationship
with
him
god
has
provided
jesus
so
that
whosoever
just
believes
in
jesus
will
have
their
nature
changed
the
holy
spirit
will
move
it
and
now
divine
nature
is
now
within
lives
our
very
beingand
us
and
god
communicate
with
each
through
his
unifying
holy
spirit
the
benefits
of
this
are
endless
for
with
the
divine
nature
living
within
us
we
can
now
see
our
imperfections
better
we
can
now
head
them
off
at
the
pass
with
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
living
in
us
we
now
have
his
power
to
help
us
overcome
our
shortcomings
because
the
divine
nature
lives
within
us
we
can
now
understand
profound
bible
passages
that
never
before
we
could
understand
because
the
divine
nature
now
lives
within

we
now
have
authority
over
demonic
forces
and
lastly
because
the
divine
nature
now
lives
within
us
we
have
eternal
lifefor
the
holy
spirit
is
eternal
the
relationship
with
jesus
is
of
the
utmost
importance
because
it
is
not
what
you
do
in
life
that
qualifies
you
to
belong
to
heavenly
kingdom
it
is
your
relationship
to
the
living
god
remember
what
jesus
said
at
the
tail
end
of
matthew
when
he
separated
the
goats
from
the
sheep
many
people
in
the
last
day
will
ask
him
didnt
i
prophesy
in
your
name
and
do
miracles
and
do
good
things
in
your
name
and
what
did
jesus
say
depart
from
me
for
i
never
knew
you
that
is
the
cornerstone
of
christianity
kent
jesus
must
know
you
as
his
friend
it
is
your
relationship
to
jesus
if
he
is
your
friend
and
you
are
his
you
will
be
counted
among
those
who
will
share
in
his
inheritance
in
heaven
brian
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
dont
feel
guilty
at
all
i
do
mistakes
and
i
regret
them
however
ive
never
had
this
huge
guilt
feeling
hanging
over
my
shoulder
good
it
shows
that
you
have
a
strong
selfimagethat
you
love
yourself
that
is
the
second
greatest
commandment
jesus
taught
if
only
more
people
could
do
as
you
do
as
i
said
before
in
the
common
english
venacular
feeling
guilty
has
a
different
meaning
than
the
state
of
guilt
this
all
is
a
very
clear
indication
that
you
need
a
certain
personality
type
in
order
to
believe
and
adjust
to
certain
religious
doctrines
and
if
your
personality
type
is
opposite
then
you
are
not
that
easily
attached
to
a
certain
world
view
system
i
believe
what
we
all
need
in
our
personalities
is
a
lot
less
ego
a
lot
less
selfcenteredness
and
a
lot
more
unconditional
love
there
are
humans
that
subscribe
to
the
same
notion
the
nice
thing
is
that
when
you
finally
shake
off
this
huge
burden
the
shoulders
feel
far
more
relaxed
yes
you
have
stated
what
jesus
said
remember
come
to
me
take
my
yoke
upon
your
shoulders
for
my
burden
is
light
a
yoke
is
used
to
direct
oxen
to
do
work
once
you
have
a
relationship
with
jesus
you
and
him
share
the
yoke
and
the
burdens
of
life
having
god
at
your
side
is

advantage

subject
objectivity
was
after
years
this
discussion
on
objective
seems
to
be
falling
into
solipsism
eg
the
recent
challenge
from
frank
dwyer
for
someone
to
prove
that
he
can
actually
observe
phenomena
someones
even
made
the
statement
that
science
is
subjective
and
that
even
atom
are
subjective
this
is
getting
a
bit
silly
and
the
word
objective
is
losing
all
meaning
lets
start
by
remembering
the
definition
of
objective
which
has
been
already
presented
objective
adj
of
or
having
to
do
with
a
material
object
as
distinguished
from
a
mental
concept
having
actual
existence
unenfluenced
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
b
based
on
observable
phenomenon
the
objectivity
of
a
thing
is
not
based
on
whether
everyone
agrees
on
that
thing
eg
the
world
is
objectively
round
regardless
of
the
fact
that
there
exist
flat
earthers
but
rather
whether
it
is
based
observable
and
verifiable
phenomenon
instead
of
being
based
solely
on
peoples
wishes
feeling
mental
processes
etc
thus
atoms
being
based
on
very
observable
and
repeatable
phenomenon
are
indeed
considered
to
be
objective
rather
than
subjective
even
weird
high
energy
physics
is
based
on
observable
phenomenon
even
though
that
observation
can
change
the
outcome
nor
are
those
observable
phenomenon
affected
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
eg
chemical
reactions
do
not
change
to
the
whims
of
different
people
thus
to
say
that
science
is
not
objective
ie
objectively
verifiable
is
a
bit
silly
as
that
is
the
point
of
science
now
i
will
agree
that
science
is
not
objectively
good
i
will
not
thereby
conclude
though
that
science
is
not
objective
now
some
examples
things
which
are
objective
a
tractor
is
larger
than
the
average
breadbox
chlorophyll
is
green
seawater
contains
salt
there
exists
ozone
in
the
atmosphere
at
least
presently
ozone
blocks
ultraviolet
light
ultraviolet
light
increases
the
incidents
of
skin
cancer
good
on
the
other
hand
is
a
value
judgement
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
an
existence
apart
from
what
we
give
it
unless
someone
can
objectively
show
the
existence
of
an
omnipotent
entity
which
has
defined
good
we
cannot
quantify
it
touch
it
or
collect
it
in
any
concrete
sense
eg
i
have
a
bag
full
of
good
now
we
do
sometimes
attempt
to
give
the
word
good
an
objective
meaning
eg
good
has
been
used
to
denote
strength
resiliency
speed
etc
that
though
is
a
subjective
definition
as
some
might
not
see
strength
and
etc
as
necessarily
good
eg
strength
inspired
by
naziism
is
not
generally
viewed
as
good
as
to
a
morality
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
morality
strictly
based
on
verifiable
observable
phenomenon
the
closest
i
have
seen
is
some
form
of
the
golden
rule
which
concludes
that
it
is
best
not
to
deliberately
piss
people
off
as
they
will
likely
then
involve
themselves
in
your
life
in
a
manner
you
wont
like
this
is
verifiable
when
you
get
in
someones
face
they
will
often
retaliate
another
objective
fact
about
morality
is
that
a
more
powerful
group
can
enforce
their
morality
on
a
weaker
group
and
thus
can
at
times
ignore
that
form
of
the
golden
rule
without
fear
of
reprisal
now
as
to
whether
this
enforcing
of
morality
is
good
or
bad
is
quite
subjective
by
the
way
remember
that
subjective
does
not
mean
that
a
thing
cannot
be
formally
stated
or
even
commonly
agreed
upon
it
only
means
that
that
it
is
not
verifiable
from
observable
phenomena
or
has
a
physical
existence
unto
itself
also
note
that
i
have
not
stated
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
objective
morality
or
that
i
could
not
accept
any
such
a
morality
i
have
simply
stated
that
i
have
seen
no
evidence
of
any
such
morality
one
other
thing
to
notice
objective
is
many
times
used
as
synonymous
with
true
andor
absolute
and
subjective
sometimes
has
the
connotation
of
false
andor
relative
taint
necessarily
so
for
instance
when
a
conclusion
is
based
on
objective
but
insufficient
evidence
then
it
can
be
both
objective
and
false
as
to
absolute
it
is
easy
to
note
that
while
we
can
objectively
show
that
tnt
is
explosive
but
that
does
not
absolutely
mean
that
all
tnt
will
explode
and
thus
objective
is
not
necessarily
absolute
either
on
the
other
hand
something
subjective
can
also
be
either
absolutist
or
true
for
instance
there
are
some
theists
who
are
specifically
absolutist
in
their
morality
even
though
they
have
only
subjective
evidence
to
back
it
up
further
many
a
scientist
and
detective
has
been
motivated
by
subjective
reasons
eg
a
gut
feeling
or
hunch
to
investigate
a
phenomena
or
situation
and
gather
the
objective
evidence
necessary
to
support
a
true
hypothesis
on
the
whole
though
i
would
have
to
agree
that
objective
evidence
is
much
more
trustworthy
than
subjective
evidence

the

told

this

the

did
you

agree
that
this
is
a
heresy
so
what
the

not

mormon
it
is
also
called

most

god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a

people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and

alike
hmm
for
a
book
that
only
applied
to
the

jesus
sure
quoted
it
a
lot
mt
in
addition
he
alludes
to
it
in
several
other
places
mt
mk
jn
and
just
in
case
it
isnt
clear
jesus
thought
the
old
testament
isnt
obsolete
ill
repeat
the
verse
in
matthew
which
gets
quoted
on
this
group
a
lot
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
have
not
come
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfill
them
i
tell
you
the
truth
until
heaven
and
earth
disappear
not
the
smallest
letter
not
the
least
stroke
of
a
pen
will
by
any
means
disappear
from
the
law
until
everything
is
accomplished
anyone
who
breaks
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
others
to
do
the
same
will
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
practices
and
teaches
these
commands
will
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteousness
surpasses
that
of
the
pharisees
and
the
teachers
of
the
law
you
will
certainly
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mt
niv
in
pretty
red
letters
so
that
you
know
its
jesus
talking
this
causes
a
serious
dilemma
for
christians
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
apply
to
them
i
think
thats
why
paul
harvey
likes
quoting
it
so
much
rob
lanphier
i
will
clarify
my
earlier
quote
gods
laws
were
originally
written
for
the
israelites
jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace
of
god
i
never
said
that
the
law
was
made
obsolete
by
jesus
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
if
youll
notice
he
also
reams
into
the
pharisees
for
mucking
up
the
law
with
their
own
contrived
interpretations
they
knew
every
letter
of
the
law
and
followed
it
with
their
heads
but
not
their
hearts
that
is
why
he
points
out
that
our
righteousness
must
surpass
that
of
the
pharisees
in
order
to
be
accepted
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
people
such
as
the
pharisees
are
those
who
really
go
out
of
their
way
to
debate
about
the
number
of
angels
that
can
dance
on
the
head
of
a
pin
they
had
become
legalistic
rulemakers
religious
lawyers
who
practiced
the
letter
of
the
law
but
never
really
believed
in
it
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it

respects
it

a

im

who
are
catholic
the
antiabortion
movement
in
the
usa
seems
to
have
a
few
hard
cases
in
it
for
example
ive
often
heard
such
people
use
the
line
catholics
arent
real
christians
indeed
anyone
sending
missionaries
to
ireland
must
certainly
be
taking
this
line
for
otherwise
why
would
they
not
be
content
for
christianity
to
be
maintained
in
ireland
in
its
traditional
catholic
form
i
have
to
agree
matthew
with
this
i
have
certainly
encountered
a
lot
of
anticatholicreligion
propaganda
emotion
some
bigotry
from
members
of
certain
religious
groups
here
they
also
practice
their
missionary
work
with
zeal
among
catholics
in
the
united
states
but
to
someone
who
is
or
was
raised
catholic
such
rhetoric
is
pretty
offputting
it
may
work
better
in
an
environment
where
theres
a
lot
of
popular
anticlericalism
followups

what

the

for

people
ive
enclosed
a
partial
list
of
the
sources
he
cites

quotes
he
exactly
used
as
a
christian
sermon
its
pretty
good
if
not
inspired
though
i
differ
in
part
on
some
of
his
conclusions
the
argument
he
presents
is
well
backed
which
is
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
work
through
still
ongoing
if
you
thought
it
was
rambling
that
says
far
more
about
you
than
it
does
koresh
youve
made
me
curious
what
does
this
say
about
me
that
you
dont
recognize
the
biblical
commentary
used
those
in
the
church
know
the
language
though
and
have
no
such
excuse
first
seal
in
revelation
the
entirety
of
psalms
and
the
most
of
revelation
which
demonstrated
one
of
his
major
points
about
how
the
writings
in
the
prophets
including
david
and
in
the
psalms
and
in
revelation
are
all
telling
the
same
story
when
you
understand
how
theyre
related
ie
have
the
key
they
largely
explain
each
other
charles
manson
used
revelation
as
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
if
koresh
liked
the
beatles
you
missed
the
point
which
is
that
the
prophets
the
psalms
and
revelation
all
together
provide
a
very
rich
view
of
a
very
special
event
a
wedding
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
just
because
he
found
ways
for
the
bible
to
backup
his
rantings
does
not
make
him
any
less
of
a
kook
how
are
you
able
to
make
such
a
conclusion
please
note
that
the
first
part
of
revelation
makes
it
clear
that
the
address
is
to
those
in
the
church
that
said
it
doesnt
hurt
to
try
to
see
what
the
prophecies
are
ahead
of
time
for
those
outside
the
church
seems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
for
the
message
he
carried
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself
so
you
say
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
what
the
investigators
conclude
and
what
the
final
judgments
are
in
the
mean
time
we
sure
learned
a
lot
about
evil
and
corruption
are
you
surprised
things
have
gotten
that
rotten
the
evil
was
inside
the
compound
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
so
much
for
war
and
government
eh
oh
yeah
one
last
point
for
the
believers
philippian
for
the
rest
of
us
could
you
please
post
the
text
very
glad
you
asked
since
i
goofed
it
should
be
philippian
here
from
niv
because
of
my
chains
most
of
the
brothers
in
the
lord
have
been
encouraged
to
speak
the
word
of
god
more
courageously
and
fearlessly
it
is
true
that
some
preach
christ
out
of
envy
and
rivalry
but
others
out
of
good
will
the
latter
do
so
in
love
knowing
that
i
am
put
here
for
the
gospel
the
former
preach
christ
out
of
selfish
ambition
not
sincerely
supposing
that
they
can
stir
up
trouble
for
me
while
i
am
chains
but
what
does
it
matter
the
important
thing
is
that
in
every
way
whether
from
false
motives
or
true
christ
is
preached
and
because
of
this
i
rejoice
my
comment
stems
from
the
realization
that
we
who
love
the
lord
are
human
and
imperfect
whatever
we
preach
no
matter
how
eloquent
or
how
corrupted
is
of
little
difference
those
who
know
the
masters
voice
will
recognize
him
a
gemstone
amidst
rock
such
is
also
the
lesson
of
the
stumblingblock

one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
the
fire
was
started
when
one
of
the
tanks
spraying
the
tear
gas
into
the
facilities
knocked
over
a
lantern
in
two
places
at
once
bit
of
a
coincidence
that
never
lived
out
in
the
country
i
see
years
ago
i
had
a
place
where
i
had
to
carry
in
propane
every
month
hook
the
bottle
up
to
copper
line
to
supply
both
the
stove
and
a
type
of
water
heater
called
a

a
flash
heater
has
a
pilot

heres
the
point
if
the
davidians
had
their
propane
tanks
hooked
up
to
copper
or
some
such
lines
run
through
the
ceiling
spaces
when
the
fbi
started
wrecking
the
place
they
could
easily
have
ruptured
the
lines
which
then
would
start
spreading
out
through
the
overhead
and
since
it
was
a
country
home
it
wasnt
necessarily
built
with
nonflamable
insulation
its
probably
more
plausible
than
anything
else
that
the
fire
started
mainly
as
a
result
of
accident
or
willful
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
fbi
which
should
have
known
better
ie
manslaughter
its
certain
that
if
the
tanks
hadnt
been
used
that
day
the
fire
wouldnt
have
started
whatever
the
faults
the

so
what
is
your
beef
against
jesus
first
and
foremost
i
honestly
do
not
believe
that
jesus
was
anything
more
than
a
man
who
lived
and
died
two
thousand
years
ago
i
know
your
bible
provides
wonderful
stories
of
the
things
he
said
and
did
but
i
simply
do
not
believe
that
he
still
exists
as
an
entity
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
universe
or
the
lives
in
it
and
i
similarly
do
not
believe
that
the
god
that
you
worship
exists
or
has
ever
existed
period
i
view
religion
in
general
and
christianity
in
specific
as
a
cultural
virus
that
has
been
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation
because
people
are
often
too
afraid
to
think
for
themselves
and
claim
responsibility
for
their
own
fate
so
they
brainwash
themselves
and
their
children
into
believing
the
popular
myths
and
it
goes
on
from
there
and
eventually
christianity
becomes
a
given
if
so
many
other
people
believe
in
it
it
must
be
right
no
i
dont
believe
in
any
life
after
death
i
believe
that
when
i
die
i
die
so
therefore
its
up
to
me
to
try
to
bring
meaning
and
purpose
to
my
life
in
the
meantime
i
dont
believe
that
its
a
good
thing
to
humble
myself
and
view
pride
as
a
sin
pride
in
moderation
is
a
constructive
thing
i
see
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
homosexuality
and
nothing
inferior
about
women
and
my
priests
lost
a
lot
of
my
trust
when
they
patronizingly
tried
to
explain
the
faults
of
these
opinions
to
me
i
dont
believe
in
loving
everyone
especially
people
ive
never
met
while
i
try
to
show
respect
to
everyone
my
love
and
admiration
is
something
not

earned
and
i
do
not
feel
guilty
about
denying
my
respect

consideration
to
someone
who
has
abused
it
if
you
want
me
to

your
religion
the
least

stop
trying

to

lawless

having
more

number
of

was

that
the
originals
were
destroyed
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
i
dont
know
what
youre
referring
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
temple
was
destroyed
some
manuscripts
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscripts
are
as
good
as
our
greek
ones
i
dont
know
about
any
originals
the
person
who
was
telling
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greeks
had
a
wonderful
library
in
alexandria
that
was
full
of
manuscriptsscrolls
and
that
it
was
burned
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
was
translated
perhaps
to
conceal
some
changes
in
the
different
versions
or
perhaps
just
as
part
of
the
typical
burning
of
valuable
things
that
occurs
during
changes
in
power
groups
hei
dunno
so
i
was
just
wondering
since
i
imagine
some
jewish
people
somewhere
must
have
had
copies
of
the
earlier
hebrew
versions
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
very
different
from
the
greek
derived
version
no
there
are
a
few
famous
discrepancies
isaiahs
prophecy
about
a
young
woman
was
changed
into
a
virgin
which
was
how
the
new
testament
writers
read
it
but
not
many
well
perhaps
this
is
the
answer
then
deleted
if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstore
youll
get
a
bible
translated
by
jews
so
there
will
be
some
differences
in
interpretation
but
the
text
theyre
translating
from
is
basically
the
same
if
you
want
to
read
the
original
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bible
that
contains
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translation
written
underneath
each
word
if
you
want
a
bible
with
a
possiblymoreoriginal
basic
text
you
can
try
to
find
a
samaritan
bible
good
luck
ive
never
seen
one
the
samaritans
no
not
the
good
samaritans
have
their
own

of
the

they
claim
the

was
altered

thanks
for

now
i
just

is

is
that
there

be
lower
for
those
who
chose
this
type
of

to

reduce

because
a
they

they
feel
it
necessary
to

their

with
the
bible
where
does
it
say
in
the
bible
that
christians
are
supposed
to
persecute
jews
isnt
it
love
your
enemies
instead
they
may
say
they
are
christian
but
do
their
actions
speak
differently
do
you
believe
what
everyone
tells
you
i
dont
i
came
to
believe
in
god
by
my
own
investigation
and
conclusions
and
ultimately
by
my
own
choice
salvation
however
was
granted
only
through
the
grace
of
god
the
bible
provides
us
with
no
clear
definition
of
what
a
christian
is
it
tells
us
what
a
christian
should
do
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
as
long
as
you
believe
your
sins
will
be
forgiven
to
be
a
christian
is
to
model
oneself
after
jesus
christ
as
implied
by
the
very
name
christian
if
you
say
you
believe
in
your
head
but
do
not
feel
in
your
heart
what
does
that
say
of
your
belief
white
supremisists

neonazis
may
not
be
your
brand
of

but
by
believing
in
christ
they
are
christian
white
supremists
and
neonazis
are
not
any
brand
of
christian
if
you
hate
your
whom
you
can
see
then
how
can
you
love
god
whom
you
cannot
see
what
does
this
belief
entail
believing
in
christ
and
having
your
sins
forgiven
in
his
name
does
not
give
a
christian
a
free
licence
to
sin
to
repent
of
a
sin
is
to
ask
forgiveness
of
that
sin
and
try
not
to
do
it
again
i
am
a
christian
but
if
you
lump
me
in
with
racists
and
accuse
me
of
being
such
then
are
you
not
prejudging
me
btw
i
am
of
chinese
racial
background
and
i
know
what
it
is
to
be

minority
in

i
dont

i
would

looked

white
supremist
christians
as
you
call
them
anyone
can
say
what
they

but
if
they
dont
practice
what
they
preach
then
their
belief
is
false
do
you
concur
now
for
your
original
statement
what
bothers
me
most
is
why
people
who
have
no
religious
affiliation
continue
to
persecute
jews
why
this
hatred
of
jews
the
majority
of
people
who
persecute
jews
are
not
christians
i
cant
speak
for
all
christians
and
there
are
bound
to
be
a
few
who
are
on
the
antisemitism
bandwagon
you
imply
here
that
it
is
predominately
atheists
and
agnostics
who
persecute
jews
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
even
an
example
of
jewish
persecution
in
the
hands
of
atheistsagnostics
nazis
and
racists
in
general
are
the
ones
that
come
to
my
immediate
attention
what
i
believe
is
that
such
people
may
be
using
the
bible
to
mask
their
racial
intolerance
and
bigotry
they
can
do
as
they
do
and
hide
behind
christianity
but
i
tell
you
that
jesus
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
about
the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind
would
be
in
the
former
soviet
union
where
many
religious
people
suffered
some
sort
of
persecution
not
to
mention
many
atheistagnostics
who
suffered
persecution
for
believing
the
government
sucked
no
arguement
there
rob
lanphier
the
only
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
those
who
call
themselves
christian
may
not
be
christian
i
ask
that
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
by
what
they
do
and
what
they
say
if
they
are
not
modelled
after
the
example
of
jesus
christ
then
they
are
not
christian
if
they
have
not
repented
of
their
sins
and
accepted
jesus
christ
as
their
personal
lord
and
saviour
then
they
are
not
christian
these
are
the
only
criteria
to
being
a
christian

he

it
was
not
a

its
not

that
more
than
one

made
this
claim
it
is
clear
that
at
least
one
of
the
survivors
made
the
contradictory
claim
that
bd
members
had
started
the
fire
no
this
is
far
from
clear
we
only
have
the
word
of
the
fbi
spokepeople
that
a
survivor
made
this
claim
we
have
the
contradictory
word
of
the
lawyers
who
spoke
with
the
survivors
individually
that
all
of
them
agreed
that
they
did
not
have
a
suicide
pact
and
did
not
intentionally
start
the
fire
in
the
absense
of
any
more
evidence
i
dont
see
how
we
can
decide
who
to
believe
furthermore
its
quite
possible
that
there
was
no
general
suicide
pact
and
that
some
small
inner
circle
took
it
upon
themselves
to
kill
everyone
else
with
the
state
of
the
area
now
we
may
never
know
what
happened
bds
were
not
contemplating
suecide
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
they
committed
one
no
reason
how
about
these
two
some
of
the
survivors
claimed
that
bd
members
poured
fuel
along
the
corridors
and
set
fire
to
it
the
speed
at
which
the
fire
spread
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
claim
again
we
have
only
the
word
of
the
fbi
on
this
claim
the
lawyers
who
have
also
talked
to
the
survors
deny
that
any
of
them
are
making
that
claim
there
was
certainly
a
fire
which
killed
most
of
the
people
in
the
compound
there
is
a
very
very
good
possibility
that
the
fbi
did
not
start
this
fire
this
is
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
bds
did
i
will
agree
on
your
assessment
as
to
the
relative
probabilities
its
more
likely
that
the
bds
started
the
fire
than
did
the
fbi
but
there
is
currently
no
way
to
decide
what
actually
happened
based
on
the
publically
available
evidence
which
is
nearly
none
even
if
the
bds
were
not
contemplating
suicide
it
is
very
possible
that
david
koresh
was
convinced
and
thus
convinced
the
others
that
this
was
not
suicide
it
was
the
fulfilment
of
a
profecy
of
some
sort
there
are
three
possibilities
other
than
the
bds
self
destruction
a
they
are
not
dead
but
escaped
via
bunkeretc
from
reports
of
the
inadequacies
of
the
tunnels
and
the
bodies
found
i
would
rate
this
as
highly
unlikely
b
the
fire
was
started
by
an
fbi
accident
this
is
possible
but
it
would
be
foolish
of
us
to
declare
this
outright
until
more
evidence
can
back
it
sure
its
possible
that
the
armored
vehicle
knocked
down
a
lantern
which
started
the
fire
why
was
there
a
lit
lantern
in
the
middle
of
the
day
near
the
edge
of
the
complex
its
anecdotal
evidence
that
has
been
contradicted
by
other
escapees
c
the
fire
was
started
on
purpose
by
the
fbi
this
has
been
suggested
by
some
on
the
net
and
i
would
rate
this
possibility
as
utterly
ludicrous
this
is
what
we
in
sciskeptic
would
call
an
extraordinary
claim
and
wont
bother
refuting
unless
someone
gives
any
good
evidence
to
back
it
up
d
the
fire
was
an
started
accidentally
by
the
bds
i
am
truely
amazed
that
i
have
heard
or
read
of
no
one
suggesting
this
possibility
with
all
the
tear
gas
and
the
lack
of
electical
power
in
the
compound
and
the
adults
wearing
gas
masks
it
had
to
have
been
chaotic
inside
i
can
easily
image
someone
leaving
a
lamp
too
close
to
something
or
accidentally
dropping
a
lamp
or
knocking
one
over
with
the
winds
it
would
have
quickly
gotten
out
of
control
so
we
are
left
with
two
reasonable
possibilities
that
the
fire
was
an
fbi
accident
and
that
the
fire
was
started
by
the
bd
i
find
the
latter
more
likely
based
on
the
evidence
ive
seen
so
far
no
i
think
that
d
is
also
quite
reasonable
i
personally
cant
really
asses
any
relative
probablities
to
either
of
these
probabilities
although
if
forced
to
bet
on
the
issue
i
would
probably
take
an
accident
either
fbi
or
bd
over
intential

add
a
comment
related
to
the
reports
that
bodies
recovered
had
gunshot
wounds
the
coroner
was
on
the
today
show
this
morning
and
categorically
denied
that
theyve
reach
any
such
conclusions
he
pointed
out
that
under
intense
heat
sufficient
pressure
builds
up
in
the
head
that
can
cause
it
to
explode
and
that
this
can
look
very
much
like
a
massive
gunshot
wound
to
the
head
which
is
quite
consisted
with
te
reports
ive

in

almost
no

corroborating

monday
we
should
remain

science
the
real
world
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
as
you
would
wish
it
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
objective
value
then
science
can
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
kick
in
the
head
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
could
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
set
of
tarot
cards
you
like
those
conclusions
i
dont
i
think
that
you
are
changing
the
meaning
of
values
here
perhaps
it
is
time
to
backtrack
and
take
a
look
at
the
word
value
n
a
fair
equivalent
or
return
for
something
such
as
goods
or
service
monetary
or
material
worth
worth
as
measured
in
usefulness
or
importance
merit
a
principle
standard
or
quality
considered
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
precise
meaning
as
of
a
word
an
assigned
or
calculated
numerical
quantity
mus
the
relative
duratation
of
a
tone
or
rest
the
relative
darkness
or
lightness
of
a
color
the
distinctive
quality
of
a
speech
or
speech
sound
in
context
of
a
moral
system
definition
four
seems
to
fit
best
in
terms
of
scientific
usage
definitions
six
or
eight
might
apply
note
that
these
definitions
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
no
im
using
definition
or
perhaps
in
both
cases
if
there
is
no
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
then
science
has
no
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
if
nothing
is
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
then
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
are
not
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
do
you
see
any
flaws
in
this
the
problem
is
your
use
of
the
word
objective
along
with
values
both
definitions
three
and
four
are
inherently
subjective
that
is
they
are
particular
to
a
given
individual
or
personal
you
see
what
one
person
may
see
as
worthwhile
another
may
see
as
worthless
if
on
the
other
hand
some
things
have
objective
worth
usefulness
or
importance
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
they
are
again
your
form
of
measurement
in
this
sentence
that
being
of
worth
is
subjective
if
you
can
provide
an
objective
foundation
for
morality
then
that
will
be
a
good
beginning
im
not
willing
to
attempt
this
until
someone
provides
an
objective
basis
for
the
notion
that
science
is
useful
worthy
or
important
in
dealing
with
observed
facts
alternatively
you
could
try
to
demonstrate
to
me
that
science
is
not
necessarily
useful
worthy
or
important
in
any
situation
in
other
words
i
need
to
know
how
you
use
the
term
objective
when
i
find
that
my
usage
of
a
word
is
different
than
the
usage
of
that
word
given
by
another
person
i
try
to
find
a
standard
against
which
to
judge
that
usage
in
most
cases
the
dictionary
is
the
standard
i
use
here
is
a
definiton
of
objective
objective
adj
of
or
having
to
do
with
a
material
object
as
distinguished
from
a
mental
concept
having
actual
existance
unenfluenced
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
b
based
on
observable
phenomenon
by
this
definition
science
does
not
have
an
objective
worth
since
the
phrase
objective
worth
is
an
oxymoron
however
you
asked
something
a
little
differently
this
time
you
asked
for
an
objective
basis
for
a
notion
the
fact
that
the
use
of
science
as
an
intellectual
tool
is
responsible
for
changes
in
our
world
the
changes
are
material
and
thus
objective
would
provide
an
objective
basis
for
an
argument
however
the
conclusion
arrived
at
from
that
argument
that
science
is
good
is
subjective
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
word
usage
take
a
little
time
and
read
the
definitions
of
these
words
objective
subjective
worth
value
morality
good
evil
i
believe
that
if
you
think
about
the
meaning
of
them
for
a
while
you
will
have
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
objective
morality

this
because
by
the

you

the
manner
with

you
show

that

for

yours
doesnt
at

sound

mine
your

doesnt

your

ive
gone
into
this
with
an
open

ive
layed
my
beliefs
aside
from
time

time
when
ive
had
doubt
and
ive
prayed
to
see
what
good
that
would
do
i
dont
see
what
more
i
can
do
to
open
myself
to
your

short
of
just
deciding

for
no

and
if
i
decide
to
believe
for
no

why
not
believe
in
some
other

zeus
seems
like
a
pretty
cool
candidate
i
am
sorry
brian
but
when
i
read
your

i
do
not
see
an

what
i

is
misunderstanding
lack

arrogance
and
mockery
please
tell
me
what
more
i
can
do
while
still
remaining
true
to
myself
be
true
to
yourself
then
have
an
open

so
end
the

put
your

read
the

there
is
truly

there
exists
a

has
so
much

you
that
the
depth
of
it
goes

our
shallow
worldly
experience
a
person
who
commits
himself
to
seeking
god
will
find

jesus
stands

a
person
who
halfheartedly
opens

mock
will
find

attitude
is

careful

at
first
be

that
they

beyond

there
lies
such
deep

once
you

you

indeed

your

not

also

saved
him

you

myself
better
be

you

you

you
attack
christians

you
might
find
yourself
one

like

proclaim
the

with

more

what
jesus
said

jesus
would
probably
say

satan
would
surely
like

you
why
so

peter
was
hardheaded
cynical
and
demonstrated
great
moments
of
stupidity
but
once
peter
committed
himself
to
a
task
he
did
with
full
heart
peter
was
the
only
apostle
to
have
the
faith
to
walk
on
water
as
jesus
did
you
asked
why
not
believe
in

zeus
didnt
offer
eternal

you
got
nothing
to

mike

writes
why
is
the
nt
tossed
out
as
info
on
jesus
i
realize
it
is
normally
tossed
out
because
it
contains
miracles
but
what
are
the
other
reasons
far
from
being
tossed
out
the
gospels
are
taken
almost
universally
as
the
primary
source
of
information
about
jesus
i
am
curious
as
to
whom
mike
cobb
is
referring
who
tosses
out
the
new
testament
undoubtedly
a
few
naive
atheists
do
this
but
the
phrasing
of
the
question
above
seems
to
suggest
that
cobb
ascribes
this
more
broadly
perhaps
the
question
that
gets
more
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
why
except
for
some
naive
believers
who
unfortunately
far
outnumber
nonbelievers
both
naive
and
critical
are
the
gospels
not
taken
as
gospel
truth
that
faithfully
records
just
what
happened
two
thousand
years
ago
this
has
an
easy
answer
and
the
answer
has
nothing
to
do
with
miracles
no
text
is
taken
this
way
by
a
critical
reader
there
is
a
myth
among
some
naive
believers
that
one
takes
a
text
measures
it
by
some
set
of
criteria
and
then
either
confirms
the
text
as
historically
valid
or
tosses
out
the
text
i
suspect
this
myth
comes
from
the
way
history
is
presented
in
primary
and
secondary
school
where
certain
texts
are
vested
with
authority
and
from
writers
such
as
josh
mcdowell
who
pretend
to
present
historical
arguments
along
these
lines
for
their
religious
program
in
fact
most
texts
used
in
primary
and
secondary
school
history
classes
ought
to
be
tossed
out
even
the
better
such
texts
should
not
be
treated
as
authoritatively
as
descibed
above
and
josh
mcdowell
would
not
know
a
historical
argument
if
it
bit
him
on
the
keister
twice
let
me
present
the
barest
outlines
of
a
different
view
of
texts
and
their
use
in
studying
history
first
all
texts
are
historically
valid
all
texts
or
to
put
this
another
way
i
have
never
seen
a
notion
of
historical
validity
that
makes
any
sense
when
applied
to
a
text
second
no
text
should
be
read
as
telling
the
gospel
truth
about
historical
events
in
the
way
that
many
students
are
wont
to
read
history
texts
in
primary
and
secondary
school
no
text
this
includes
your
favorite
authors
history
of
whatever
every
text
is
a
historical
fact
every
text
was
written
by
some
person
or
some
group
of
people
for
some
purpose
hence
every
text
can
serve
as
historical
evidence
the
question
is
what
can
we
learn
from
a
text
of
what
interesting
things
if
any
does
the
text
provide
evidence
the
diaries
of
the
followers
of
the
maharishi
formerly
of
oregon
are
historical
evidence
the
gospels
are
historical
evidence
the
letters
of
the
officers
who
participated
in
the
vampire
inquests
in
eastern
europe
are
historical
evidence
the
modern
american
history
textbooks
that
whitewash
great
american
figures
are
historical
evidence
these
are
all
historical
evidence
of
various
things
they
are
not
much
evidence
at
all
that
the
maharishi
formerly
of
oregon
could
levitate
that
jesus
was
resurrected
that
vampires
exist
or
that
great
american
figures
are
as
squeaky
clean
as
we
learned
in
school
they
are
better
evidence
that
some
people
saw
the
maharishi
late
of
oregon
levitate
that
some
of
the
early
christians
thought
jesus
was
resurrected
that
many
people
in
eastern
europe
saw
vampires
return
from
the
grave
and
that
we
still
have
an
educational
system
that
largely
prefers
to
spread
myth
rather
than
teach
history
how
does
one
draw
causal
connections
and
infer
what
a
piece
of
historical
evidence
text
or
otherwise
evinces
this
is
a
very
complex
question
that
has
no
easily
summarized
answer
there
are
many
books
on
the
subject

various
parts
of
the

rosicrucian
adventure
hello
ceci
my
name
is
tony
and
i
have
a
few
comments
on
your
rosicrucian
adventure
i
hereby
state
that
i
am
not
claiming
or
denying
membership
in
any
order
fraternity
etc
with
or
without
the
word
rosicrucian
in
the
name
of
the
organization
i
only
claim
having
done
some
homework
this
is
intended
as
a
friendly
article
and
if
at
times
it
seems
different
its
my
lack
of
writing
skills
showing
nothing
else
heck
english
may
be
my
second
language
and
then
again
maybe
not
by
now
i
proceed
i
had
an
ehum
interesting
experience
with
the
rosicrucians
or
at
least
rosicrucians
of
some
sort
last
sunday
lets
start
with
the
name
rosicrucian
i
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
body
and
being
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you
met
some
rosicrucians
you
mean
members
of
a
group
that
calls
themselves
rosicrucian
at
least
that
is
what
your
observation
suggests
id
prefer
if
you
would
have
stated
up
front
that
it
was
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
only
because
they
may
be
confused
by
some
readers
of
this
newsgroup
with
the
rosicrucian
order
amorc
based
the
usa
jurisdiction
in
san
jose
ca
this
being
the
rc
org
with
the
most
members
last
time
i
looked
of
course
most
members
does
not
necessarily
mean
best
anyway
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
claims
they
descend
at
least
in
part
from
what
was
the
goldundrosenkreuz
golden
and
rosy
cross
from
the
century
there
were
two
golden
and
rosy
cross
the
first
chronologically
more
alchemical
the
second
with
masonic
tinges
but
their
history
is
the
subject
of
a
complete
chapter
youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatever
had
been
presented
by
amorc
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
impression
ie
youd
probably
have
had
a
positive
impression
more
likely
than
a
negative
one
imho
the
first
guy
also
said
that
the
rs
are
a
mystical
christian
order
and
that
they
base
their
teachings
on
the
teachings
of
the
kathars
english
from
the
thirteenth
century
again
instead
of
rs
it
should
be
lectorium
rosicrucianum
it
is
curious
to
know
that
other
rc
orders
in
the
usa
claim
to
be
non
sectarian
the
cathars
were
a
heretic
christian
sect
that
directly
challenged
the
authority
of
the
medieval
catholic
church
they
flourished
during
the
century
century
which
saw
the
religious
zeal
expressed
in
the
crusades
and
also
the
growing
disillusion
with
the
catholic
church
and
the
worldly
ways
of
its
clerics
it
was
largely
in
response
to
the
churchs
unseemly
pomp
and
splendor
that
catharism
took
root
first
in
northern
italy
then
throughout
the
south
of
france
what
made
me
a
bit
suspicious
was
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contained
something
divine
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divinity
then
that
we
couldnt
become
divine
as
the
persons
we
are
currently
but
if
we
worked
really
hard
we
would
reach
eternal
bliss
i
dont
see
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
with
us
containing
something
divine
and
yes
i
dont
like
phrases
like
eternal
bliss
either

to
robotize
people

brainwash

re
burden
of
proof
in
article
jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom
writes
the
default
condition
in
the
absence
of
a
preponderance
of
evidence
either
way
is
that
the
proposition
or
assertion
is
undecidable
and
the
person
who
takes
the
undecidable
position
and
says
that
heshe
simply
disbelieves
that
the
proposition
is
true
is
the
only
one
who
holds
no
burden
of
proof
this
is
why
the
socalled
weak
atheist
position
is
virtually
unassailable
not
because
it
stands
on
a
firm
foundation
of
logical
argument
but
because
its
proponents
simply
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
gods
and
therefore
they
hold
no
burden
of
proof
when
you
dont
assert
anything
you
dont
have
to
prove
anything
thats
where
weak
atheism
draws
its
strength
but
its
strength
is
also
its
achilles
heel
without
assertionsaxioms
one
has
no
foundation
upon
which
to
build
as
a
philosophy
its
virtually
worthless
imo
of
course
yes
as
a
philosophy
weak
atheism
is
worthless
this
is
true
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
as
a
philosophy
christians
disbelief
in
zeus
is
worthless
atheists
construct
their
personal
philosophies
from
many
different
sources
building
nongodbased
ideas
in
the
same
way
as
christians
build
nonzeusbased
ideas
of
thunderbolts
atheists
no
more
base
their
philosophy
on
atheism
than
christians
base
theirs
on
the
nonexistence
of
zeus
the
weak
atheist
position
is
logically
extremely
assailable
any
logical
demonstration
of
the
existence
of
a
god
completely
destroys
it
as
soon
as
the
demonstration
is
made
in
the
presence
of
a
given
weak
atheist
atheists
in
this
newsgroup
are
barraged
regularly
with
attempts
to
provide
such
a
logical
demonstration
and
they
all
fail
miserably
in
fact
most
of
the
people
around
here
who
claim
the
strong
as
opposed
to
mathematical
atheist
position
do
so
on
this
basis
not
only
do
we
not
believe
in
a
god
but
also
all
the
arguments
presented
in
favor
of
particular
gods
have
to
date
proven
unsound
therefore
one
can
say
that
those
gods
as
argued
by
those
arguments
do
not
exist
this
doesnt
apply
to
such
philosophers
gods
as
are
defined
to
be
logically
undemonstrable
but
these
are
not
the
gods
of
popular
religion
and
the
coherence
of
such
claims
is
quite
questionable

what
do
you
folks
think
this
are
the
tenets
of
stan
as
handed
down
and
set
within
the
holy
book
of
stan
thou
shalt
not
spill
thine
drinks
or
waste
thine
food
for
all
that
is
is
sacred
and
to
waste
is
the
denizen
of
luc
the
infidel
all
who
waste
today
shall
have
not
tomorrow
thou
shalt
pay
heed
to
those
who
know
the
higher
calling
of
stan
so
that
they
may
teach
you
the
way
and
that
thou
shalt
become
one
with
stan
and
the
universe
shall
be
in
your
hands
thou
shalt
honor
thy
loved
ones
and
cherish
those
near
you
for
they
are
the
true
path
to
happiness
and
happiness
is
a
devine
gift
of
thy
lord
stan
stan
is
the
one
true
god
and
shall
be
taken
before
all
others
so
that
the
false
gods
will
know
that
he
is
the
one
and
all
who
oppose
him
shall
forever
be
banished
to
the
form
of
the
sheep
and
be
sent
to
the
flocks
of
luc
for
all
eternity
the
word
is
the
law
and
the
law
is
the
word
the
word
is
within
thine
own
heart
follow
the
path
and
be
true
to
thine
own
self
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
by
stan
thy
lord
and
saviour
thou
shalt
honor
the
faiths
of
others
for
it
is
their
choice
to
follow
this
path
and
do
not
think
less
of
others
for
being
of
a
different
faith
yet
even
in
the
face
of
these
false
gods
do
not
waiver
in
thine
faith
in
stan
and
hope
that
the
unbeliever
will
see
the
light
that
is
stan
thou
shalt
not
wrong
others
for
being
different
for
stan
cherishes
the
different
and
holds
freedom
in
the
highest
regard
for
to
do
less
would
be
to
fall
in
with
luc
the
infidel
for
stan
does
not
control
he
merely
guides
and
lets
the
choice
lie
within
thine
own
heart
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
lord
stan
has
many
names
and
is
called
differently
by
many
people
but
know
also
that
stan
is
the
true
name
and
all
those
of
the
faith
shall
know
that
stan
is
god
and
god
is
stan
thou
shalt
be
to
the
world
what
thou
art
to

for

is

thy

stan
asks

he
asks
only

not

read
the
first
chapter
interestingly
just
as
the
branch
davidians

roots

seventhday
adventist
movement
the
sdas
themselves
had
their

in
the
millerite
movement
of
the
first
half
of
the
centurya
movement
that
expected
the
end
of
the
world

was
disappointed
when
it
did
not
take
place
and
wound
up
as

put

re
did
he
really
rise
emery
the
one
single
historic
event
that
has
had
the
biggest
impact
on
the
world
over
the
centuries
is
the
resurrection
of
jesus
this
is
hardly
possible
as
the
majority
of
people
in
the
world
were
born
lived
their
life
and
died
without
ever
knowing
anything
about
christ
the
majority
of
the
rest
of
the
world
have
decided
that
he
is
not
who
emery
thinks
he
is
emery
why
were
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
documents
so
convinced
that
jesus
really
did
rise
from
the
dead
we
have
four
gospel
accounts
i
am
leaving
out
all
proofs
of
emerys
which
rely
on
quoting
the
bible
as
proof
circular
reasoning
etc
there
have
been
occasions
already
stated
many
times
for
later
generations
of
xtians
to
change
edit
or
otherwise
alter
the
bible
to
fit
their
political
gospel
and
if
we
accept
the
bible
as
true
just
because
the
bible
says
it
is
true
then
to
be
fair
we
have
to
do
the
same
to
the
bhagavadgita
and
the
koran
both
of
which
contradict
the
bible
enough
said
emery
yet
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
these
disciples
to
be
immoral
and
dishonest
we
have
no
historic
information
that
would
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
these
people
were
not
godfearing
people
who
sincerely
and
wholeheartedly
believed
that
the
resurrection
of
their
lord
jesus
was
a
real
event
and
for
what
gain
would
they
lie
to
make
a
stand
at
that
time
meant
persecution
imprisonment
and
perhaps
even
death
again
this
is
only
the
biblical
account
and
there
is
no
independent
proof
of
any
of
this
happening
it
just
isnt
there
besides
simply
being
sincere
or
willing
to
die
for
your
faith
does
not
make
your
faith
correct
there
are
muslims
dying
in
bosnia
right
now
does
the
fact
that
they
are
willing
to
die
for
islam
mean
that
islam
is
the
correct
religion
emery
history
bears
out
the
persecution
of
christians
roman
historian
cornelius
tacitus
govenor
of
asia
in
ad
writing
of
neros
reign
alluded
to
the
torture
of
christians
in
rome
all
you
have
proven
is
that
these
people
were
tortured
for
their
faith
that
does
not
prove
that
their
faith
is
true
or
correct
it
just
means
that
they
were
sincere
in
their
beliefs
being
willing
to
die
for
what
you
believe
doesnt
make
your
belief
the
truth
its
not
that
easy
and
minority
religions
have
always
suffered
torture
muslims
suffer
torture
and
harassment
in
india
and
bosnia
today
all
religions
are
harassed
in
china
today
you
havent
proven
anything
so
far
emery
with
all
the
suffering
and
persecution
that
it
meant
to
be
a
believer
it
would
be
quite
probable
that
at
least
one
of
those
in
the
supposed
conspiracy
would
come
forward
and
confess
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
big
hoax
not
if
they
didnt
believe
that
it
was
a
hoax
emery
yet
not
one
did
it
seems
rather
reasonable
that
the
disciples
did
not
make
up
the
resurrection
but
sincerely
believed
that
jesus
had
actually
risen
from
the
dead
especially
in
light
of
the
sufferings
that
came
upon
those
who
believed
the
followers
of
muhammad
firmly
believed
in
the
miracles
that
the
koran
says
muhammad
performed
they
were
attacked
and
slaughtered
for
their
beliefs
they
didnt
denounce
muhammad
or
islam
if
you
are
correct
then
that
means
islam
is
the
true
faith
you
see
how
stupid
your
proofs
are
subject
re
judas
crucifixion
tyre
etc
frank
decenso
but
how
its
evident
from
the
texts
in
ezek
that
god
isnt
concerned
about
buildings
or
structures
god
is
concerned
about
people
the
people
and
leadership
ezek
never
did
return
as
a
city
others
may
have
come
later
and
built
a
city
but
the
people
and
leadership
that
god
prophesied
about
in
ezek
were
never
rebuilt
as
a
city
of
people
and
leaders
how
incredibly
fucking
stupid
of
course
the
text
is
referring
to
the
city
itself
buildings
bricks
mortar
etc
otherwise
it
makes
no
sense
to
refer
to
the
future
of
tyre
as
being
reduced
to
nothing
but
a
place
to
spread
fishing
nets
is
there
any
twisting
of

that
you
wont

probably
closer
to

to
say

what
you

starts
nowan
infinitely
high
quality
of

living
in
fellowship
with
god
in

even
if
your
deity
does

that
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
because
of
my
actions
and
my
choices
if
your
god
decides
to
toss
me
into
a
flaming
pit
for
this
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
cease
to
exist
but
if
your
god
wants
my
respect
and
my
obedience
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
does
then
they
will
be
very
strong

true
if
my

exists
you
would

some
brazenly
fly
in

i
point
these
out
where
i
can
the
truth
is
is
that
it

you
do
not
even
know
what
christianity
is
and
you
are
arguing
against
it
and
in
my
opinion
youre
bumbling
about
blindly
making
up
entities
where
there
arent
any
and
depriving
yourself
of
a
true
understanding
and
enjoyment
of
your
life
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beliefs
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
beliefs
to
myself
but
as
soon
as
you
start
waving

expect
me

toss

and
i
felt
torn
when
i
began
to
disagree
with
a
lot
of
what
the
bible
and
my
priests
told
me
did
it
start
getting
a
little
uncomfortable
did
your
style
start
feeling
a
bit
cramped
yes
thats
exactly
what
i
felt
my
heart
just
felt
that
what
i
was
being
taught
was
wrong
a
basically
good
message
but
framed
in
errors
i
could
not
with
a
clear
conscience
accept
that
women
were
somehow
not
equal
to
men
that
homosexuals
are
guilty
of
their
lifestyle
that
pride
in
ones
work
is
a
bad
thing
that
jesus
died
for
me
i
dont
want
anybody
to
die
for
me
especially
as
an
impersonal
act
where
the
person
cant
possibly
even
know
me
well
enough
to
really
know
if
im
worth
dying
for
or
not
i
was
never
able
to
accept
the
bit
about
jesuss
death
being
a
good
thing
if
that
means
that
im
just
not
comprehending
a
basic
message
of
christianity
then
so
be
it
maybe
im
just
not
compatible
with
christianity
i
just
refuse
to
follow
rules
blindly
and
since
i
cant
even
convince
myself
that
your
god
even
exists
in
the
way
you
describe
it
ive
got
to
just
follow
my
own
conscience
in
these
matters
i
know
how
that
goes
knowing
i
couldnt
and
didnt
want
to
live
up
to
those
impossibleand
rather
incovenient
rules
are
what
kept
me
outside
too
dont
think
that
my
morals
are
shoddy
or
nonexistent
just
because
i
dont
believe
in
your
god
i
will
not
steal
and
i
will
not
murder
not
because
i
fear
divine
repudiation
but
because
these
just
arent
in
my
character
you
may
think
theres
nothing
keeping
me
from
just
running
around
on
a
murdering
spree
stealing
things
when
im
able
insulting
people
for
the
heck
of
it
because
im
not
answerable
to
anyone
but
youd
be
wrong
im
answerable
to
myself
a
life
like
that
would
be
a
cheap
life
i
happen
to
want
to
earn
respect
in
myself
till
i
met
the
man
that
is
my
initial
break
with
christianity
came
after
a
lot
of
soulsearching
and
a
lot
of
wondering
why
i
could
no
longer
feel
the
presence
of
god
with
me
i
finally
decided
that
i
had
once
felt
this
presence
just
as
i
had
felt
my
mighty
teddy
bear
beside
me
when
i
was
a
little
tyke
protecting
me
from
the
monsters
under
the
bed
that
i
had
believed
in
god
just
as
i
had
believed
in
the
teddy
bear
as
something
of
an
emotional
crutch
to
protect
me
from
perceived
dangers
since
then
ive
never
abandoned
the
possibility
that
maybe
your
supernatural
trinity
does
exist
but
there
are
a
few
times
when
in
my
darkened
room
by
my
bed
i
have
set
aside
everything
i
believe
for
a
moment
and
called
out
to
whatevers
out
there
because
i
want
to
know
the
truth
even
if
it
means
abandoning
everything
i
know
and
i
have
not
yet
received
an
answer
only
when
i
truly
listened
to
myself
body
and
soul
did
i
realize
that
i
could
no
longer
honestly
keep
up
the
charade
of
being
christian
there
is
a
higher
truth
in
the
universe
and
christianity
just
aint
it
any
suggestions
on
what
or
who
or
where
it
might
be
and
why
nope
it
may
well
be
unknowable
scientists
have
suggested
that
the
universe
may
be
finite
and
wrap
around
on
itself
the
threedimensional
universe
may
be
mapped
onto
a
fourdimensional
supersphere
in
the
same
way
you
can
map
a
twodimensional
plane
onto
a
threedimensional
sphere
see
sphereland
the
sequel
to
flatland
for
more
thoughts
on
this
our
entire
universe
might
just
be
an
electron
in
a
four
dimensional
universe
which
in
turn
may
only
be
an
insignificant
speck
in
a
universe
above
that
and
so
on
and
so
forth
until
the
variables
become
too
much
for
us
to
even
speculate
on
that
is
theres
no
possible
way
for
us
to
know
exactly
how
we
came
to
be
so
theres
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
your
god
exists
nor
had
anything
to
do
with
it
ok
you
may
say
so
now
if
im
just
being
good
am
i
doing
good
enough
thats
for
you
to
answer
if
you
feel
youre
doing
fine
then
go
ahead
and
ignore
us
foolish
little
christians
we
can
present
what
weve
seen
and
experienced
providing
our
witness
but
it
isnt
up
to
us
to
make
that
seed
sprout
christians
have
provided
me
with
nothing
except
quotes
from
your
holy
book
and
all
sorts
of
tactics
to
try
to
get
me
to
believe
guilt
trips
insinuations
that
im
without
morals
arguments
from
disbelief
how
can
you
possibly
believe
that
god
doesnt
exist
and
so
forth
all
im
asking
is
for
you
to
convince
me
i
want
to
be
convinced
but
its
not
going
to
be
easy
so
much
as
you
dont
like
what
were
selling
there
just
may
be
someone
out
there
that
can
identify
with
it
methinks
you
could
give
us
all
a
lesson
in
tolerance
and
back
off
having
had
years
upon
years
of
contact
with
your
religion
from
both
the
inside
and
the
outside
i
view
it
as
harmful
in
many
ways
it
preys
on
people
who
want
to
find
meaning
in
their
lives
and
once
its
got
these
people
it
teaches
them
to
have
pity
and
sometimes
starkly
intolerant
of
others
who
do
not
share
these
views
maybe
youll
say
that
your
religion
doesnt
teach
that
but
ive
got
to
judge
christianity
from
the
christians
i
know
i
feel
that
it
is
entirely
possible
and
good
to
have
faith
in
ones
self
and
to
be
a
positive
influence
on
society
for
no
better
reason
than
that
so
i
hope
that
my
words
in
this
newsgroup
will
at
least
make
some
people
think
i
want
christians
to
realize
that
there
are
perfectly
valid
lifestyles
and
opinions
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
deity
whatsoever
and
i
want
people
who
are
considering
christianity
to
realize
that
christianity
does
not
hold
the
sole
key
to
a
happy
fulfilled
life
i
have
known
some
very
nice
christians
who
have
done
some
very
nice
things
i
think
what
sets
these
people
apart
from
the
general
masses
is
that
they
recognize
that
their
religious
beliefs
may
be
wrong
and
they
know
the
weaknesses
of
their
religion
yet
they
still
decide
to
believe
but
they
keep
their
beliefs
to
themselves
and
do
not
think
any
less
of
people
who
dont
agree
with
them
obviously
the
debate
on
the
veracity
and
reliability
of
the
source
of
the
christians
faith
is
far
from
conclusive
notwithstanding
how
vehemently
we
propose
otherwise
precisely
my
point
youve
still
not
given
me
a
reason
to
be
a
christian
instead
of
a
buddhist
or
a
moslem
the
nice
thing
about
religion
if
you
lose
yourself
deeply
enough
in
it
is
that
eventually
youll
be
able
to
feel
justified
in
most
anything
you
want
to
do
yknow
your
right
fortunately
for
everyone
around
me
im
not
religious
im
a
christian
just
as
the
moslems
arent
religious
and
the
buddhists
arent
religious

recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
he
is
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
god
granted
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creates
the
living
creature
to
examine
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
its
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becomes
a
threat
for
example
lets
say
the
scientist
creates
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
and
it
breaks
free
of
its
confines
and
starts
devouring
the
population
the
scientist
would
not
hesitate
in
killing
it
god
creates
us
to
be
his
loving
companions
he
knows
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
lets
us
know
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
god
cannot
abide
by
sin
by
rejecting
god
a
person
becomes
an
enemy
of
god
one
that
must
be
killed
by
him
note
i
say
that
god
and
god
alone
is
worthy
to
be
judge
jury
and
executioner
we
are
not
called
to
carry
out
such
duties
because
we
are
not
worthy
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
god
is
god
who
are
we
to
question
the
creator

you
doubt
gods
doing

do
you

the

after

jesus

sorry
if
this

god
never
changes
he
still
loves
us
sending
jesus
was
one
of
his
attempts

reconcile
with

the
nature
of
god
has
not
changed
also
while
were
at

how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind

loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
sinning
in
the
face
of
god
was
punishable
by
immediate
death
there
are
several
ot
passages
to
back
this
up
god
is
god
he
cannot
tolerate
the
prescence
of
sin
in
his
midst
and
the
israelites
knew
this
and
still
some
of
them
chose
to
disobey
and
were
destroyed
were
these
people
kind
and
loving
themselves
god
gave
them
every
break
he
could

in
the

he
really
had
no

sent
his
son
to

for

to

sin
offering
now
we

the

an

as

us
out
of

now
that
we
are

does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an
example
of
a
kind
and
loving
god
hey
lets
be
fair
for
a
moment
here
kind
and
loving
does
not
mean
a
free
ride
there
is
an
amount
of
give
and
take
as
in
any
relationship
parents
are
supposed
to
be
kind
and
loving
but
does
that
mean
that
children
can
do
whatever
they
want
not
part
of
being
a
parent
means
administering
punishment
when
the
child
is
at
fault
part
of
being
a
parent
means
giving
instruction
god
tests
us
through
the
trial
of
life
such
that
we
may
grow
stronger
he
teaches
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
the
consequences
of
our
actions
are
made
clear
to
us
be
it
heaven
or
be
it
hell
if
god
did
not
follow
through
with
what
he
has
warned
us
about
he
would
not
be
a
very
good
parent
in
parenting
if
a
parent
issues
a
warning
but
does
not
follow
through
with
it
the
children
will
not
take
that
parents
words
very
seriously
god
does
the
same
by
telling
us
who
have
ears
to
hear
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
by
lifes
trials
we
see
the
folly
of
doing
our
own
will
rather
than
his
he
warns
us
about
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
when
it
comes

do
we

jg
didnt
expect
to
find
you
in
the
devils
role
stephen
but
these
are
the
times
that
try
mens
souls
o
what
was
called
many
months
of
planning
was
probably
the
intelligence
collecting
paperwork
and
interviews
nine
months
as
i
understand
it
no
doubt
this
accounts
for
a
significant
amount
of
the
time
as
government
efficiency
in
spending
our
tax
dollars
would
certainly
seek
its
absolute
minimum
in
such
an
event
but
my
gut
instinct
says
there
is
more
at
hand
it
took
some
careful
preplanning
to
demonize
dk
to
such
an
extent
the
attack
meshes
well
with
more
restrictive
gun
control
legislation
that
seems
to
be
the
agenda
of
the
day
it
also
fits
a
pattern
of
increased
government
interference
in
personal
religious
beliefs
randy
weaver
is
now
on
trial
o
its
important
to
them
because
it
justifies
budgets
no
quarrel
here
the
big
bang
theory
is
always
apt
at
appropriation
time
they
just
dont
have
to
possess
a
single
motive
o
the
warrant
was
sealed
to
keep
from
jeopardizing
the
the
governments
case
i
certainly
think
publication
of
the
warrant
undermines
the
governments
case
since
it
makes
no
claims
of
illegal
action
therefore
the
federal
judge
had
reason
to
seal
it
but
i
am
reminded
of
senator
frank
churchs
remark
that
secrecy
is
the
trademark
of
a
totalitarian
government
there
is
rarely
sufficient
motive
to
seal
a
warrant
in
a
nation
of
free
people
o
there
was
probably
no
one
actually
exercising
oversite
instead
a
system
of
bureaucratic
rules
has
been
set
up
for
such
incidents
like
computer
programs
these
have
to
be
debugged
periodically
especially
when
used
in
fringe
areas
cf
the
hostage
rescue
program
therefore
no
one
was
in
charge
and
no
one
can
reasonably
be
held
responsible
how
can
i
argue
with
irrefutable
logic
i
have
long
suspected
that
the
government
has
become
a
mindless
machine
and
now
you
go
and
confirm
my
worst
fears
has
it
become
a
beast
that
is
programmed
simply
to
say
kiss
my
toe
and
you
get
your
piece
of
the
pie
i
suspect
bugs
in
the
program
arise
when
agents
or
those
who
love
this
critter
have
independent
thoughts
o
what
they
were
after
generally
speaking
is
protecting
their
jobs
budgets
and
paychecks

watching

believe

the
federal

had
a
conflict

interests
here
throught
out
the
whole
affair
it
seamed
to
me
that
they
were
chiefly
concerned
with
saving
face
rather
than
saving
lifes
its
true
that
the
bd
were
resisting

that
they
should
have
surrendered

they

realized
that
these
where
federal
officers

they
didnt

when
they
didnt
the

should
not
have
treated

he
was

lies
now
before
everyone
gets
crazy
with
me
let
me
say
that
koresh
was
crazy
as
a
bed
bug
but
out
government
was
crazierand
they
lied
to
us
they
told
us
compound
had
been
under
survaillance
for
quite
some
time
yet
whoever
was
watching
the
place
failed
to
see
that
koresh
went
jogging
and
into
town
on
a
regular
basis
everyone
in
the
area
claimed
to
have
seen
him
and
wondered
why
they
didnt
pick
him
up
then
there
are
two
possible
answers
first
they
didnt
see
him
what
kind
of
survaillance
is
that
second
they
didnt
care
they
wanted
a
confrontation
they
wanted
publicity
and
they
got
it
after
the
first
battle
they
told
us
that
they
did
not
know
he
knew
they
were
coming
they
also
said
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
in
knowing
that
well
we
know
now
that
they
intercepted
the
informants
call
and
went
in
anyway
did
they
explore
all
of
the
possibilities
for
ending
the
seige
according
to
them
they
did
but
according
to
the
hartford
courant
the
woman
that
raised
koresh
his
grandmother
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
and
see
him
the
fbi
agent
who
she
spoke
with
was
bob
ricks
and
according
to
the
paper
he
said
a
lot
of
people
think
if
you
just
talk
to
them
logically
they
will
come
out
his
grandmother
raised
vernon
howell
koreshs
real
name
she
didnt
raise
david
koresh
someone
who
raises
you
and
loves
you
does
not
speak
to
you
strickly
on
a
logical
level
there
is
also
an
emotional
level
on
which
they
can
reach
you
heres
another
one
all
during
this
operation
the
fbi
has
been
claiming
that
they
feared
a
mass
suicide
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
something
must
be
done
now
they
claim
they
never
thought
he
would
do
it
i
knew
they
were
going
to
do
something
when
they
started
talking
about
how
much
money
this
was
costing
that
was
the
start
of
the
justification
part
part
of
the
plan
thats
when
i
knew
it
would
come
soon
but
back
to
the
plan
it
is
considered
cruel
and
unusal
punishment
to
execute
criminals
in
the
minds
of
many
people
but
look
at
whats
acceptable
they
knew
the
parents
adults
had
gas
masks
they
did
not
know
or
were
not
sure
if
the
children
had
them
so
the
plan
was
to
pour
the
gas
into
the
compound
the
mothers
seeing
what
the
gas
was
doing
to
their
children
were
supposed
to
run
out
and
that
would
only
leave
the
men
to
deal
with
i
spent
two
years
in
the
army
and
like
everyother
veteran
i
went
through
cbr
chemical
biological
radiological
warfare
training
part
of
that
training
is
going
into
a
room
filled
with
the
same
stuff
that
the
children
were
subjected
to
to
make
the
stuff
really
interesting
the
gas
also
has
a
chemical
agent
that
irritates
the
skin
you
think
its
on
fire
i
have
no
doubts
the
children
would
become
hysterical
its
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
never
want
to
do
again
this
was
the
plan
the
final
solution
we
waited
days
for
our
hostages
to
come
home
from
iran
we
gave
these
people
days
i
stated
on
several
occasions
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
this
whole
thing
that
the
government
could
point

as

he
suggested
that

because
not

shot
had

not

were

the

is
blazing

i
may
sound
paranoid
but
our
government
is
out
of
control
and
killing
a
few
federal
officers
make
knock
some
sense
back
into
it
hmm
the
police
strategy
of
bursting
in
with
weapons
drawn
clearly
marked
as
officers
and
yelling
police
repeatedly
this
is
used
every
day
to
bust
drug
houses
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspects
into
submission
with
surprise
and
display
of
firepowere
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
as
for
not
knocking
its
a
sad
necessity
in
many
cases
since
the
suspects
will
attempt
to
escape
or
even
fight
usually
this
strategy
works
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
used
so
commonly
now
would
it
whether
or
not
it
was
appropriate
to
use
this
strategy
on
the
bd
is
not
my
point
since
i
dont
think
any
of
us
have
enough
information
to
make
a
clear
judgement
on
this
issue
i
merely
point
out
that
it
is
a
valid
strategy
which
is
used
every
day
furthermore
we
dont
know
of
any
substitute
strategy
capable
of
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and
armed
suspects
do
you
suggest
that
the
police
always
knock
with
guns
holstered
and
never
arrest
any
suspects
until
they
have
been
allowed
to
inspect
the
officerss
badges
just
what
should
the
police
do
when
apprehending
potentially

how
far
can
they

themselves
what

you

can
do
which
cant

by

even
if
youve

who
may

thats
not

in

gods
laws
were

jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace

i
never

was

by
jesus
just
for
reference
heres
the

quote
malcolm
lee
mleepostroyalroadsca
wrote
in
reference
to
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
these
are
two
conflicting
statements
to
say
one
is
a
clarification
of
the
other
is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
people
shifting
their
position
on
an
issue
it
irritates
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premise
that
no
change
was
made
what
about
deuteronomy
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesus
change
that
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
sure
he
does
this
however
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stoning
nonvirgin
brides
because
this
needs
no
clarification
are
you
going
to
deny
that
deuteronomy
is
not
patently
clear
in
its
intent
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
ill
agree
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharisees
that
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believe
in
it
depending
on
how
they
use
this
knowledge
they
can
be
scary
they
can
argue
any
position
they
desire
and
back
it
up
with
selected
parts
of
the
bible
such
pharisees
include
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualify
this
by
saying
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
believed
what
they
were
preaching
but
the
ends
certainly
made
the
means
look
frightening
however
just
as
scary
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bible
but
believe
every
word
in
fact
this
is
probably
scarier
since
there
are
far
more
of
these
people
from
what
ive
seen
in
addition
they
are
very
easy
to
manipulate
by
the
aforementioned
pharisees
since
they
dont
know
enough
to
debate
with
these
people
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
no
it
demands
obedience
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
personally
told
me
how
i
should
behave
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
doing
gods
will
by
doing
it
however
if
preachers
pastors
and
evangelists
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
people
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everything
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarcely
be
honest
with
myself
by
saying
im
doing
the
will
of
god
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
well
if
god
respects
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bible
about
eternal
damnation
for
nonbelievers
i
see
little
respect
eminating
from
the
god
of
the
bible
i
see
a
selfish
and
spiteful
god
god
be
with
you
not
yours
thanks
malcolm

rob
lanphier
and
for
the
curious
here
is
my
earlier
post
hmm
for
a
book
that
only
applied
to
the
israelites
deuteronomy
jesus
sure
quoted
it
a
lot
mt
in
addition
he
alludes
to
it
in
several
other
places
mt
mk
jn
and
just
in
case
it
isnt
clear
jesus
thought
the
old
testament
isnt
obsolete
ill
repeat
the
verse
in
matthew
which
gets
quoted
on
this
group
a
lot
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
have
not
come
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfill
them
i
tell
you
the
truth
until
heaven
and
earth
disappear
not
the
smallest
letter
not
the
least
stroke
of
a
pen
will
by
any
means
disappear
from
the
law
until
everything
is
accomplished
anyone
who
breaks
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
others
to
do
the
same
will
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
practices
and
teaches
these
commands
will
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteousness
surpasses
that
of
the
pharisees
and
the
teachers
of
the
law
you
will
certainly
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mt
niv
in
pretty
red
letters
so
that
you
know
its
jesus
talking
this
causes
a
serious
dilemma
for
christians
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
apply
to
them
i

indeed

misctaoism

let
us
not
limit
misctaoism
to
philosophy
but
if
we
dont
limit
it
to
something
the
discussion
degenerates
into
a
big
amorphous
glob
other
questions
thyagi
proposes
are
what
is
this
actual
process
of
reality
why
is
taoism
based
upon
an
assumption
why
does
this
assumption
concern
knowledge
and
what
can
be
known
what
is
the
value
of
not
knowing
what
is
a
tao
what
does
it
mean
to
be
taod
it
seems
to
me
that
these
questions
more
properly
fall
into
the
category
of
general
metaphysics
i
would
prefer
any
misctaoism
to
deal
more
closely
with
topics
and
works
more
closely
associated
with
at
least
semiorthodox
taoism
with
established
classic
works
definitely
included
and
works
like
mantak
chias
argued
about
i
think
neotaoism
should
be
excluded
or
get
its
own
group
what
i
mean
by
this
is
humptydumpty
taoism
in
which
taoism
means
whatever
a
poster
says
it
means
this
alttaoism
could
also
be
a
refuge
for
debates
about
what
taoism
really
means
or
speculations
on
sexual
alchemy
etc
eg
from
thyagi
again
taoism
does
what
the
hell
it
wants
i
tell
you
taoism
doesnt
exist
taoism
is
no
more
real
that
tao
decide
now
real
or
not
real
exist
or
notexist
when
shall
we
be
certain
kent
gloomily
predicts
quoting
from
thyagis
article
however
most
traffic
in
the
group
will
likely
concern
the
philosophical
secular
taoism
averred
by
alan
watts
and
niels
bohr
and
yogic
taoism
as
it
pertains
to
medical
sexual
and
martial
techniques
i
think
that
discussions
of
this
nature
are
not
completely
out
of
place
whats
happening
is
that
that
the
term
taoism
is
becoming
completely
polluted
and
trivialized
like
the
words
magic
alchemy
zen
etc
by
writers
appropriating
the
word
to
mean
whatever
they
want
this
is
seen
by
the
spate
of
new
age
books
entitled
the
tao
of
this
that
and
everything
else
with

to
some
exceptions
like
the
books
by
jou
tsunghwa
any
other
commentsideas
i
look
forward
to
seeing
them
on
balance
i
say
let
misctaoism
rip
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
if
it
just
gets
filled
up
with
college
freshmen
asking
about
the
tao
of
sex
then
it
will
have
been
a
failure
and
people
will
post
to
these
groups
just

all

back

our

principal
ended
the

with
amen

can

opposing

ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
god
granted
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
in
other
words
he
can
do
it
he
did
it
and
your
in
no
position
to
argue
about
it
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creates
the
living
creature
to
examine
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
its
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becomes
a
threat
for
example
lets
say
the
scientist
creates
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
and
it
breaks
free
of
its
confines
and
starts
devouring
the
population
the
scientist
would
not
hesitate
in
killing
it
god
creates
us
to
be
his
loving
companions
he
knows
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
lets
us
know
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
god
cannot
abide
by
sin
by
rejecting
god
a
person
becomes
an
enemy
of
god
one
that
must
be
killed
by
him
note
i
say
that
god
and
god
alone
is
worthy
to
be
judge
jury
and
executioner
we
are
not
called

carry

such
duties
because
we
are
not

you
better
do
what
this

wants
you
to
do

else
who
is

on
us
who
can

librbabyuvmbitnet
when
robert
refers
to
the
orthodox
he
is
talking
about
the
historical
position
of
the
christian
faith
such
things
are
derived
from
biblcal
texts
through
the
centuries
by
the
apocolic
fathers
of
the
faith
you
are
right
that
people
read
things
differently
in
the
bible
and
this
is
alright
in
parts
like
parables
and
such
forth
however
when
it
comes
to
the
essential
doctrines
of
the
historical
orthodox
christan
beliefs
there
is
only
one
correct
way
to
read
it
for
example
either
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
is
true
or
it
is
false
yes
people
read
the
texts
differently
but
only
one
position
is
true
they
both
cannot
be
according
to
the
text
the
doctrine
is
true
and
has
always
existed
therefore
when
people
like
joseph
smith
come
along
with
a
vision
and
thinks
he
can
undo
centuries
of
a
doctrine
that
is
supported

why

the
books
regarded
as
scripture
whats
going

i
will
pass
on
psychologizing
answers
whether
dismissive
or
more
open
as
not
the
kind
of
issue
to
deal
with
here
the
question
is
what
is
the
theological
point
involved
and
it
has
been
quoted
at
me
often
enough
by
those
who
dont
believe
i
take
it
seriously
that
jesus
is
said
to
have
said
if
you
love
me
you
will
obey
my
commands
john
i
am
like
any
christian
the
slave
of
christ
and
it
is
my
will
that
i
should
do
as
he
wills
me
to
do
i
am
also
or
instead
his
younger
brother
but
still
under
his
direction
though
we
both
call
god
abba
christians
therefore
will
try
to
find
what
it
is
that
their
lord
commands
them
and
discovering
it
will
feel
obligated
to
do
it
or
to
confess
their
failure
readers
here
may
set
aside
the
theologizing
jargon
such
as
slaves
of
christ
the
point
is
that
adherents
of
a
religion
will
read
the
texts
whether
classified
as
inspired
or
not
that
are
held
up
as
models
in
an
effort
to
find
application
to
their
own
situations
this
practice
ranges
from
devotional
reading
of
sermons
and
the
like
to
the
exegesis
of
canon
ical
scripture
as
the
word
of
god
and
at
the
highest
pitch
this
leads
to
a
question
of
whether
we
can
find
in
inspired
scripture
something
that
can
act
as
absolute
guidance
for
our
actions
the
problem
is
in
finding
out
just
what
it
is
our
lord
commands
i
am
going
to
set
aside
for
this
essay
one
major
direction
in
which
christians
have
looked
for
these
commands
namely
christian
tradition
that
is
not
because
i
reject
tradition
but
because
my
primary
audience
in
this
essay
is
protestants
who
deny
tradition
a
determinative
value
in
favor
of
the
witness
of
scripture
the
question
i
want
to
deal
with
is
what
commandments
can
we
find
from
our
lord
in
scripture
and
that
turns
out
to
be
a
hard
question
if
any
of
my
protestant
inquisitors
would
like
to
turn
the
discussion
to
the
authority
of
tradition
i
can
accomodate
them
unlike
most
protestants
episcopalians
admit
claims
from
a
scripture
b
reason
and
c
tradition
on
roughly
equal
standing
earlier
in
john
than
my
quote
above
we
read
john
i
give
you
a
new
commandment
love
one
another
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
nt
where
christians
are
given
an
explicit
commandment
with
the
context
commenting
on
its
imperative
mode
pronouncement
by
jesus
at
the
same
meal
so
we
readers
infer
since
it
is
not
in
john
but
in
the
synoptics
jesus
says
take
this
bread
this
is
my
body
mark
cf
matthew
luke
corinthians
the
mode
is
imperative
greek
labete
and
hence
this
too
is
a
commandment
in
both
cases
we
have
to
infer
that
the
command
is
directed
to
a
wider
circle
than
the
immediate
collocation
of
disciples
because
we
judge
the
evangelists
point
in
mentioning
it
with
the
disciples
by
then
mostly
or
entirely
dead
is
that
we
are
expected
to
follow
this
as
a
commandment
from
our
lord
in
the
case
of
communion
pauls
mention
at
least
this
is
probably
true
of
the
evangelists
also
implies
an
ongoing
ritual
liturgy
in
which
these
words
operate
to
bind
christians
to
the
original
command
to
his
disciples
as
a
continuing
commandment
to
the
christian
community
i
am
entirely
comfortable
with
this
inference
but
i
must
point
out
that
it
is
there
between
us
and
the
occasion
on
which
jesus
spoke
the
command
i
take
it
as
a
clear
inference
at
the
very
least
the
evangelists
notion
that
all
christians
are
called
to
love
one
another
in
jesus
command
directed
at
the
disciples
but
i
have
to
call
attention
to
the
inference
the
command
cannot
apply
to
me
without
the
generalization
from
the
specific
context
of
its
statement
to
my
own
context
as
a
disciple
of
christ
all
reading
of
scripture
has
to
make
such
inferences
to
get
any
sense
out
of
the
text
whatsoever
this
is
a
general
problem
in
reading
these
texts
we
cannot
read
them
at
all
without
our
own
understanding
of
our
native
languages
in
which
we
normally
read
the
translated
texts
and
without
some
appreciation
of
the
original
context
and
at
points
the
original
languages
when
english
misleads
us
i
am
going
to
presume
in
what
follows
that
we
have
the
general
problem
of
how
to
read
scripture
under
control
i
dont
really
think
this
is
true
but
it
will
suffice
for
my
current
purposes
i
will
address
only
the
issues
that
arise
when
we
have
already
coped
with
the
understanding
of
a
year
old
text
from
another
world
than
the
one
we
live
in
questions
at
that
level
only
introduce
more
reser
vations
about
the
commandments
issue
than
will
be
found
stipulating
that
we
can
read
the
texts
as
the
original
audience
might
have
done
among
the
reasons
we
have
for
seeing
johns
agapate
allelou
as
a
general
commandment
not
merely
an
instruction
by
jesus
to
this
disciples
on
that
one
occasion
and
one
linking
it
to
the
synoptic
great
commandment
is
that
we
have
criticism
from
jesus
about
limiting
our
love
to
those
whom
we
congenially
associate
with
in
matthew
we
read
you
have
learnt
how
it
was
said
you
must
love
your
neighbor
and
hate
your
enemy
but
i
say
to
you
love
your
enemies
in
fact
the
leviticus
context
quoted
does
not
say
hate
your
enemy
it
is
merely
the
common
human
presumption
and
leviticus
is
at
pains
to
say
that
the
love
should
extend
to
strangers
amongst
the
people
of
israel
luke
in
expanding
on
this
same
q
context
goes
on
to
have
jesus
say
even
sinners
love
those
who
love
them
all
of
this
suggests
quite
strongly
id
say
that
limiting
the
scope
of
the
new
commandment
is
not
quite
what
jesus
has
in
mind
in
short
inference
leads
me
to
generalizing
the
actual
text
to
a
command
that
is
in
force
on
christians
and
with
objects
not
limited
to
other
christians
trickier
than
the
agapate
allelou
or
institution
of
communion
there
is
the
case
of
the
great
commission
where
matthew
mark
the
twelve
are
sent
out
to
evangelize
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
the
verb
is
imperative
kerussete
but
the
context
is
rather
specific
to
the
twelve
and
there
are
further
specifiers
as
in
do
not
turn
your
steps
to
pagan
territory
and
do
not
enter
any
samaritan
town
the
lukan
parallels
are
even
more
specific
to
jesus
final
journey
to
jerusalem
which
make
it
harder
to
see
this
generalizing
to
all
christians
than
the
previous
examples
that
hasnt
prevented
christians
from
making
such
an
inference
what
i
have
to
call
attention
to
is
that
such
inference
is
not
justified
in
the
text
nor
unlike
the
first
two
cases
i
cite
by
the
rhetoric
of
the
evangelist
urged
on
the
reader
still
paul
seems
to
have
felt
obliged
to
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
even
contrary
to
jesus
instructions
to
the
to
the
gentiles
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
so
christians
after
him
have
also
taken
this
as
a
commandment
in
the
sense
of
john
do
i
accept
this
i
dont
know
it
is
surely
rather
speculative
but
you
see
how
the
ripples
of
inference
spread
out
from
the
text
that
is
the
pretext
christians
may
infer
a
general
commandment
applicable
to
all
from
what
is
presented
in
the
gospels
as
a
specific
occasion
i
do
not
necessarily
object
to
this
kind
of
generalization
but
i
insist
that
people
who
make
it
must
have
an
understanding
that
they
are
reasoning
at
some
considerable
length
from
what
we
actually
have
in
scripture
there
are
assumptions
involved
in
this
reasoning
and
these
are
not
themselves
scriptural
though
people
will
do
their
best
to
justify
their
assumptions
by
other
references
to
scripture
which
simply
adds
more
inference
into
the
mix
lets
move
on
to
the
great
commandment
that
we
should
love
god
with
our
whole
hearts
and
minds
and
souls
this
is
perhaps
the
synoptic
equivalent
of
johns
agapate
allelou
and
yet
it
is
not
presented
as
a
commandment
in
our
texts
rather
the
context
is
controversy
with
the
pharisees
to
cite
matthew
but
when
the
pharisees
heard
that
he
had
silenced
the
sadducees
they
got
together
and
to
disconcert
him
one
of
them
put
a
question
master
which
is
the
greatest
commandment
of
the
law
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
here
though
i
accept
it
as
such
that
jesus
answer
is
meant
to
be
a
commandment
to
christians
he
is
answering
a
polemic
from
his
enemies
marks
account
in
casts
the
answer
in
a
far
more
positive
light
as
so
the
scribe
in
this
version
says
far
more
important
than
any
holocaust
i
need
to
point
out
that
this
word
originates
in
the
context
of
animal
sacrifice
forget
the
nazis
for
this
or
sacrifice
luke
is
intermediate
he
has
a
lawyer
posing
the
question
to
disconcert
jesus
and
gets
the
good
samarian
parable
for
his
pains
luke
the
contexts
here
are
so
confusingly
various
that
one
could
be
forgiven
for
drawing
no
inferences
in
no
account
is
this
said
as
if
it
were
obviously
to
be
taken
as
a
commandment
binding
on
christians
though
i
think
it
an
entirely
reasonable
conclusion
in
each
case
that
jesus
thinks
it
to
be
so
the
point
is
that
our
mental
gears
have
to
grind
a
cycle
or
so
to
get
to
any
conclusion
from
all
of
this
about
what
we
are
commanded
to
do
by
jesus
and
all
of
this
is
contingent
on
our
understanding
the
point
of
jesus
use
of
the
torah
in
the
all
quite
different
gospel
accounts
and
the
application
of
such
a
context
to
us
the
different
contexts
among
the
synoptics
are
curious
it
should
be
noted
that
only
in
luke
do
we
get
the
fixing
of
this
command
by
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
we
may
look
for
an
analogous
intent
in
matthew
where
gives
the
golden
rule
as
the
meaning
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
where
we
may
also
hear
an
echo
of
hillel
saying
the
same
a
generation
before
jesus
if
we
make
these
associations
which
i
think
are
entirely
reasonable
we
are
again
indulging
in
inference
the
texts
do
not
explicitly
support
us
rather
we
read
the
texts
as
having
this
kind
of
interrelationship
current
literary
theory
calls
this
intertextuality
my
discussion
of
why
the
agapate
allelou
has
to
apply
beyond
the
community
of
the
disciples
and
beyound
the
circle
of
christian
believers
applies
again
here
to
buttress
a
conclusion
that
this
is
despite
the
presentation
not
saying
so
explicitly
a
commandment
to
christians
few
christians
would
disagree
with
my
conclusions
but
i
must
point
out
that
they
are
conclusions
they
depend
on
rather
elaborate
chains
of
reasoning
that
are
simply
not
present
in
the
texts
themselves
the
contextual
problem
keeps
coming
up
more
and
more
severely
as
we
look
at
those
sayings
of
jesus
that
are
not
so
universally
taken
by
christians
as
commandments
and
we
get
some
really
hard
cases
take
divorce
mark
is
pretty
clear
the
man
who
divorces
his
wife
and
marries
another
is
guilty
of
adultery
against
her
cf
luke
except
that
matthew
has
an
escape
clause
except
in
the
case
of
fornication
this
seems
to
be
a
rather
clear
commandment
whether
or
not
we
take
matthews
reservation
and
some
christians
to
this
day
take
it
so
but
some
dont
at
least
in
practice
this
is
rather
peculiar
it
is
not
as
if
jesus
were
not
explicit
about
this
whereas
he
says
nothing
at
all
about
some
of
the
things
people
gnash
their
teeth
over
how
is
it
possible
if
the
commands
of
christ
are
clear
that
matthew
can
so
disagree
with
the
other
evangelists
of
the
synoptic
tradition
im
going
to
continue
this
examination
into
evermurkier
waters
but
this
is
enough
to
start
with
the
theme
is
finding
commandments
in
scripture
is
an
exercise
in
inference
our
inferences
are
informed
by
our
assumptions
that
is
our
own
cultural
biases
i
have
so
far
identified
a
very
few
commandments
that
are
generally
accepted
by
all
christians
and
yet
in
these
already
some
of
the
difficulties
start
to
surface
it
is
these
difficulties
i
want
to
discuss
in
my
next
essay
on
this
topic
the
divorce
commandment
already
strikes
at
some
of
the
difficulties
i
see
almost
no
evidence
that
the
people
who
are
so
eager
to
find
commandments
to
condemn
me
with
spend
any
time
at
all
writing
nasty
screeds
to
soccouples
or
misclegal
about
the
horrors
or
viciousness
of
divorce
or
demanding
that
us
law
refuse
to
allow
it
or
refuse
unrepentant
divorcees
places
in
their
churches
that
is
not
to
say
that
divorce
doesnt
enter
into
consideration
in
general
it
is
most
definitely
a
matter
of
concern
in
even
the
most
liberal
church
circles
for
example
a
wildly
liberal
episcopalian
priest
of
my
aqauintence
in
a
wildly
liberal
diocese
has
recommended
to
a
couple
who
approached
him
to
marry
them
that
they
have
a
private
secular
ceremony
before
a
judge
so
that
the
public
ceremony
he
celebrated
need
not
go
through
an
agonizing
examination
by
officials
who
would
just
as
soon
not
take
on
this
role
of
interpreting
the
commands
we
are
faced
with
as
christians
this
in
a
church
that
was
effectively
created
by
a
famous
divorce

when

going

hear
a

answer
to
this
question
in
paraphrase
on
what
or
whose
authority
do
christians
proclaim
that
they
are
above
the
law
and
above
the
prophets
major
and
minor
and
not
accountable
to
the
ten
commandments
of
which
jesus
clearly
spoke
his
opinion
in
matthew
what
is
the
source
of
this
pseudodoctrine
who
is
the
pseudoteacher
who
is
the
great
deceiver
ok
heres
at
least
one
christians
answer
jesus
was
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
this
context
matthew
makes
sense
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesus
came
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfill
jesus
lived
under
the
jewish
law
however
he
was
the
culmination
of
the
promises
of
the
prophets
he
came
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
and
fully
obey
gods
purposes
verse
says
for
truly
i
say
to
you
until
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pass
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
the
key
to
this
verse
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesus
as
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
accomplished
what
the
law
was
supposed
to
accomplish
jesus
did
not
say
that
he
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
and
unless
im
mistaken
heaven
and
earth
have
not
yet
passed
away
am
i
mistaken
and
even
assuming
that
one
can
just
gloss
over
that
portion
of
the
word
of
jesus
do
you
really
think
that
all
is
accomplished
verse
whoever
then
annuls
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
so
teaches
others
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keeps
and
teaches
them
he
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesus
teaching
jewish
people
about
living
lives
under
the
law
this
makes
sense
then
why
didnt
jesus
say
any
jew
who
annuls
in
v
are
you
saying
that
all
of
jesus
recorded
words
mean
nothing
to
gentiles
are
you
really
saying
that
jesus
only
spoke
for
and
to
the
jews
jesus
didnt
mention
your
name
does
that
mean
he
wasnt
speaking
to
you
when
you
read
the
words
of
jesus
do
you
think
he
is
speaking
to
someone
other
than
you
in
general
it
appears
that
jesus
is
responding
to
some
criticism
he
must
have
received
about
doing
away
with
the
law
that
was
not
jesus
intent
at
all
you
said
above
that
jesus
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
are
you
saying
that
does
not
mean
doing
away
with
the
law
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the
law
as
it
should
be
lived
and
fulfill
the
promises
made
by
god
to
his
people
all
the
way
back
to
eve
gen
serpent
will
bruise
your
heel
but
he
will
bruise
his
head
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
they
shall
strike
at
your
head
and
you
shall
strike
at
their
heel
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
he
will
strike
your
head
and
you
will
strike
his
heel
and
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
looks
like
your
translation
has
taken
a
few
liberties
with
the
word
jesus
appeared
to
be
doing
away
with
the
law
because
he
did
not
honor
the
traditions
of
men
as
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularly
locked
horns
with
the
religious
leaders
of
the
day
because
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rules
only
gods
law
in
the
matthew
passage
jesus
is
defending
his
dedication
to
the
law
and
defending
himself
against
his
accusors
almost
the
entire
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedicated
to
helping
the
jewish
people
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweeping
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduced
by
the
pharasees
and
their
traditions
only
helping
the
jewish
people
in
galatians
paul
describes
the
relationship
of
jesus
to
the
law
in
this
way
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custody
under
the
law
being
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
was
later
to
be
revealed
therefore
the
law
has
become
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justified
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
sons
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
i
believe
this
says
that
after
christ
was
revealed
the
law
had
served
its
purpose
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
has
been
fulfilled
as
christ
said
he
would
do
you
are
using
your
interpretation
of
paul
as
an
argument
against
the
clear
words
of
jesus
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesus
are
the
same
personality
therefore
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesus
are
based
on
the
same
moral
principles
it
makes
sense
that
many
of
the
principles
in
the
old
law
are
reexpressed
in
christianity
reexpressed
care
to
define
that
a
bit
better
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
what
are
heaven
and
earth
gone
away
where
did
they
go
is
all
accomplished
for
example
revelations
explain
please
christians
relate
to
god
through
christ
not
the
law
it
also
makes
sense
that
new
practices
and
new
symbolisms
were
established
to
represent
the
mysteries
of
this
new
relationship
ie
baptism
representing
christs
death
burial
and
resurrection
rom
the
lords
supper
as
a
memorial
to
his
sacrifice
i
cor
and
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
commemorating
his
resurrection
matt
acts
again
your
interpretation
of
paul
versus
the
clear
word
of
jesus
do
you
see
any
problems
here
when
did
heaven
and
earth
go
away
when
was
all
accomplished
ok
thats
one
christians
explanation
i
dont
claim
to
have
all
these
issues
completely
settled
even
in
my
own
mind
and
i
welcome
other
christians
to
offer
other
alternatives
please
excuse
the
long
posting
thanks
for
your
interest
if
you
have
read
this
far
subject
re
whos
next
mormons
and
jews
would
someone
be
kind
enought
to
document
the
exact
nature
of
the
evidence
against
the
bds
without
reference
to
hearsay
or
newsreports
i
would
also
like
to
know
more
about
their
past
record
etc
but
again
based
on
solid
not
media
reports
my
reason
for
asking
for
such
evidence
is
that
last
night
on
larry
king
live
a
socalled
cultexpert
was
interviewed
from
australia
who
claimed
that
it
was
his
evidence
which
led
to
the
original
raid
this
admission
if
true
raises
the
nasty
possibility
that
the
government
acted
in
good
faith
which
i
believe
they
did
on
faulty
evidence
it
also
raises
the
possibility
that
other
self
proclaimed
cult
experts
were
advising
them
and
giving
ver
poor
advice
a
few
years

the

of
tragic
results
if
selfproclaimed

were
ever
taken
seriously
perhaps
their
diagnosis
of
the

if
the

people

are
doing
so

to

it

have

ask
this
question
as
a

christian
ill
back
off
when
they
do
does
anybody
else
besides
me
see
a
vicious
circle
here
i
guarantee
you
the
people
who
want
school
prayer
arent
going
to
back
off
when
they
cant
even
manage
to
get
a
quiet
moment
for
their
kids
to
pray
silently
their
kids
can
bloodywell
pray
any
goddamned
time
they
want
to
and
nothing
on
heaven
or
earth
in
government
or
the
principals
office
can
prevent
or
in
any
other
way
deal
with
their
doing
so
especially
if
the
prayer
is
silent
as
bursting
out
into
the
shema
yisrael
or
some
other
prayer
might
be
construed
as
disruptive
if
audible
no
one
ever
prevented
me
from
praying
in
public
school
they
hardly
even
prevented
me
from
masturbating
in
study
hall
i
should
have
thought
better
of
someone
posting
from
a
uchicago
address
how
can
you
manage
to
say
such
nonsense
without
shame
muslim
students
might
have
a
complaint
if
they
are
prevented
from
setting
out
their
rugs
and
doing
the
proper
ablutions
before
prayer
at
the
times
specified
in
the
quran
jews
would
probably
like
the
opportunity
to
daven
with
tefillim
and
whatever
else
they
require
at
their
appropriate
times
i
do
not
see
them
complaining
though
muslims
and
jews
have
a
case
that
no
christian
i
have
ever
heard
has
been
able
to
make
the
christian
insistence
on
a
public
universal
enforced
moment
of

is
nothing

the
inquisition

i
already
responded
to
this
on
one
dimension
but
afterthoughts
cause
me
to
make
another
independent
reply
the
problem
with
a
moment
of
silence
is
that
it
is
not
an
evenhanded
way
of
allowing
for
religion
amongst
students
in
the
public
schools
as
i
noted
before
muslims
need
more
than
a
moment
of
silence
in
order
to
perform
the
prayers
they
are
required
by
muhammad
to
do
and
at
least
orthodox
jewish
prayer
also
has
requirements
that
are
not
addressed
by
this
there
is
in
fact
a
highly
selective
bias
towards
christian
prayer
in
this
moment
of
silence
shit
and
that
is
especially
bizarre
in
that
christian
prayer
doesnt
need
this
stuff
a
christain
may
pray
totally
incognito
at
any
time
to
some
extent
this
is
true
of
muslims
and
jews
as
well
what
i
intend
in
my
first
paragraph
is
that
there
are
some
characteristic
forms
of
prayer
in
these
religions
which
do
need
special
times
andor
behavior
which
cannot
be
undertaken
without
an
observer
being
able
taking
note
of
it
a
christian
may
pray
at
any
time
silently
and
without
any
trace
of
his
activity
being
evident
to
others
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
of
the
other
religious
traditions
amongst
us
certainly
these
tend
to
have
some
forms
of
prayer
that
would
evidence
differences
from
americanprotestant
mainstream
religion
all
that
a
moment
of
silence
does
is
to
allow
that
one
tradition
which
doesnt
need
it
to
have
a
special
place
set
aside
in
the
public
schools
there
is
nothing
in
christian
prayer
that
requires
public
forms
or
rugs
or
phylacteries
or
anything
else
at
all
visible
to
the
outside
world
a
christian
student
may
and
probably
does
pray
at
innumerable
times
during
the
day
without
anyone
else
knowing
it
that
may
also
be
true
of
non
christians
i
am
not
claimng
otherwise
in
the
moment
of
silence
it
would
still
be
difficult
for
the
jews
to
gather
and
daven
for
the
muslims
to
do
their
ablutions
and
find
qiblah
to
mecca
and
engage
in
the
prescribed
forms
but
of
course
christians
can
do
their
thing
and
therefore
the
provision
is
nothing
but
a
disguised
attempt
to
encourage
just
that
luckily
there
is
a
strong
jewish
presence
in
this
country
and
i
as
a
christian
revere
some
of
the
jewish
teachers
i
had
in
public
schools
and
a
growing
muslim
presence
as
well
i
can
only
hope
that
the
political
forces
consequent
on
this
will
prevent
the
imposition
of
christian
forms
on
nonchristians
as
far
as
i
can
see
as
a
christian
there
is
nothing
in
this
moment
of
silence
campaign
but
an
attempt
to
use
public
social
pressure
to
force
children
to
adhere
to
a
pattern
that
is
biased
towards
christianity
and
as
a
christian
i
must
protest
such
coercion
for
what
its
worth
i
suspect
that
the
coercion
is
not
really
targeted
at
the
nonchristians
it
is
yet
another
case
of
failure
amongst
christian
parents
in
making
their
children
prayerful
so
that
they
want
the
public
schools
to
teach
what
they
cannot
manage
to
teach
despite
having
all
the
opportunity
in
the
world
to
do
so
if
you
have
taught
your
children
to
pray
they
do
not
need
a
moment
of
silence
in
school
if
you
have
not
managed
to
teach
them
the
moment
will
only
embarrass
you
give
it
up

light
has
come

but
men
loved
darkness
instead
of
light
because
their
deeds
are
evil
everyone
who
does

hates

will
not

kent
sandvik
says
it
seems
we
are
dealing
with
a
blackandwhite
interpretation
brian
are
you
subtly
accusing
me
of
evil
things
because
i
never
saw
the
light
however
this
is
even
more
confusing
because
i
even
admit
that
i
dont
like
the
situation
where
im
not
informed
black
and
white
a
spade
is
a
spade
there
is
no
hidden
agenda
behind
this
so
stop
trying
to
look
for
one
it
is
an
easy
and
as
straight
forward
as
it
reads
kent
i
am
not
accusing
you
of
evil
things
jesus
is
accusing
you
and
it
is
not
only
you
that
he
is
accusing
he
is
accusing
everyone
me
you
and
everyone
in
the
world
is
guilty
whether
one
sees
the
light
or
does
not
seen
the
light
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
do
evil
things
we
do
them
regardless
jesus
uses
the
word
men
i
am
included
jesus
is
not
soloing
you
out
jesus
is
making
a
general
statement
about
out
the
sad
state
of
man
christians
are
not
immuned
from
doing
evil
things
a
christian
is
just
a
person
in
whom
the
holy
spirit
indwells
a
christian
can
see
the
evil
he
is
doingbecause
his
evil
has
been
brought
out
into
the
light
jesus
is
not
saying
that
just
because
evil
has
been
exposed
that
the
christian
will
stop
doing
evil
if
you
havent
seen
jesuss
light
your
evil
deeds
simply
havent
been
exposed
to
the
his
light
you
may
shed
some
light
on
your
own
your
human
spirit
shines
at
perhaps
candela
but
the
holy
spirit
shines
at
a
megacandela
the
holy
spirit
can
shine
light
into
places
inside
us
where
we
didnt
even
know
existed
so
do
you
see
jesuss
point
christians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
do
not
want
to
come
into
the
light
of
jesus
because
they
will
see
all
the
problems
in
their
lives
and
they
will
not
like
the
sight
it
is
an
ugly
thing
to
see
how
far
we
have
fallen
from
jesuss
perspective
do
you
think
you
want
to
know
how
really
ignorant
you
are
do
you
think
brian
kendig
wants
to
know
do
you
think
i
want
to
know
ego
verses
the
truth
which
do
you
choose
im
watching
the
news
about
a
man
who
saw
the
light
and
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
as
part
of
his
insight
into
the
light
i
dont
think
the
world
is
that
simple
and
if
you
act
in
such
ways
when
you
are
enlighted
then
im
a
happy
man
and
i
pray
i
will
never
receive
such
light
and
i
watched
koresh
too
an
imposter
who
thought
he
saw
the
light
who
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
sadly
as
part
of
his
delusion
it
is
even
sadder
that
the
people
who
died
with
him
chose
to
die
with
them
and
that
ignorance
was
their
downfall
to
death
and
kent
dont
you
bury
yourself
underneath
a
rock
with
an
excuse
like
bringing
up
koreshas
if
koresh
actually
had
truth
in
him
david
koresh
was
no
light
and
no
excuse
for
you
to
stay
away
from
the
real
jesus
christ
david
koresh
who
claimed
to
be
jesus
was
a
fraud
it
was
obvious
david
koresh
was
born
in
america
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
koresh
wasnt
even
a
good
imposter
having
missed
an
obvious
point
as
that
jesus
warned
of
such
imposters
in
the
endtimes
david
koresh
wasnt
anything
new
to
jesus
jesus
told
us
to
be
aware
of
imposters
years
ago
so
the
next
time
an
imposter
makes
a
scene
and
claims
to
be
jesus
ask
the
obvious
where
were
you
born
was
your
mothers
name
mary
if
the
branch
davidians
asked
that
simple
question
they
would
have
labeled
koresh
a
liar
right
from
the
start
the
wouldnt
have
followed
koresh
they
wouldnt
have
died
but
look
what
happened
their
ignorance
cost
them
their
lives
their
choice
to
be
ignorant
cost
them
a
lot

in

jesus
rebuked
satan
back
with
the

it
didnt
work

did

tried

do

did

did

koresh
did

this

persecution
murder

finally
forced

it
is

to
remember
that
these
secular

were
held
by

people
and
that
at
the

almost
all

were
pretty

the

christians
disgust
at
such

which
resulted

that
is
exactly
the
problem
the
mormon

was

not

by
a

it
was
allowed

to
prevent
incidents
like
this
order
from
occurring
in
the
first
place
as
i
indicated
in
an
earlier
posting
your
irrational
hatred
is
clearly
evidenced
by
individuals
like
robert
weiss
who
could
have
been
gov
boggs
lieutenant
he
would
have
fitted
right
in
drewling
et
al
and
seems
a
modernday
occurrence
based
on
results
slander
persecution
misrepresentation
lies
denying
mormons
representation
in
their
own
user
group
etc
etc
in
intent
and
purpose
what
really
has
changed
the
situation
is
not
entirely
different
today
many
irrational
feelings
and
beliefs
are
justified
through
religion
i
dont
think
most
of
them
are
started
because
of
religion
but
religion
certainly
helps
justify
and
perpetuate
prejudices
and
practices
by
providing
a
neat
justification
which
discourages
critical
thought
true
as
evidenced
by
numerous
examples
as
i
am
sure
youre
aware
in
any
regard
mormon
history
alone
indicates
that
secular
authorities
and
i
dont
even
discuss
how
uthans
were
suckered
into
allowing
part
of
their
lands
in
becoming
nervegas
and
atomic
bomb
testing
grounds
is
far
from
being
trusted
or
righteous
have
things
really
changed
for
the
better
i
may
be
a
born
cynic
but
i
have
no
reason
whatsoever
that
such
has
been
the
case
in
the
early
i
believe
the
late
president
kimball
lds
church
leader
strongly
protested
federal
attempts
to
locate
the
mxpeace
keeper
missile
maze
from
being
built
in
utah
yet
another
inspired
decision
from
secular
authorities
fortunately
his
opposition
was
influential
enough
for
the
feds
to
back
off
do
you
mean
that
the
secular
authorities
are
some
continuous
group
of
people
with
the
common
and
uninterrupted
goal
of
harrassingeradicating
the
mormons
do
you
honestly
believe
that
the
main
reason
for
using
utah
for
nuclear
testing
etc
was
to
get
them
thar
mormons
and
what
about
the
majority
of
uthans
who
arent
mormons
you
seem
to
be
searching
for
enemy
correction
the
majority
of
utahns
are
mormon
i
believe
up
to
a
in
many
cities
and
settlements
throughout
the
western
states
conspiracies
it
is
paranoid
to
believe
that
everything
that
affects
you
badly
must
have
been
done
primarily
for
that
purpose
what
i
mean
is
that
secular
authorities
are
to
be
watched
as
we
believe
that
satan
has
been
given
some
power
and
dominion
over
the
earth
to
divert
truth
judgment
and
justice
in
addition
we
believe
that
the
adversary
has
power
to
influence
the
unjust
and
idolatrous
greed
for
money
would
be
a
good
example
in
order
to
bring
about
persecution
war
oppression
and
evil
combinations
as
an
intelligent
being
dont
you
suppose
that
the
destroyer
would
yield
his
influence
foremost
on
those
with
political
power
as
far
as
utah
is
concerned
what
i
pointed
out
were
some
horrible
examples
of
environmental
nightmares
imposed
upon
by
secular
authorities
which
have
brought
death
disease
ie
the
downwinders
and
environmental
contami
nation
i
am
hardly
paranoid
i
am
just
not
expecting
too
much
from
a
secular
government
that
may
not
share
our
values
and
faith
and
which
indeed
as
gov
boggs
et
al
may
be
out
to
harm
and
destroy
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
prophecies
in
my
church
indicate
that
in
future
years
global
persecution
against
mormons
will
so
increase
in
intensity
and
scope
that
paraphrasing
all
those
who
wish
to
escape
persecution
and
murder
must
flee
to
zion
zion
the
pure
in
heart
will
be
reestablished
in
those
days
and
it
aint
our
current
secular
authorities
who
will
rule
over
it
david
koresh
did
not
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
federal
authorities
or
the
security
of
this
nation
and
with
john
i
too
wonder
who
or
whats
next
i
personally
feel
that
we
should
try
to
stop
anyone
who
is
a
threat
to
the
life
of
even
one
person
sure
he
did
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
this
nation
but
he
did
pose
a
threat
to
the
lives
of
his
followers
that
much
is
definite
hmmm
definite
by
whom
until
such
has
been
established
beyond
reason
able
doubt
this
alleged
threat
may
have
been
less
than
the
threat
imposed
upon
him
and
his
followers
by
the
batf
and
fbi
who
killed
who
what
constitutional
right
did
the
atf
officers
have
to
invade
upon
private
land
and
to
force
themselves
into
the
compound
what
really
caused
the
murder
of
the
little
children
could
it
be
that
the
atffbi
presence
has
any
bearing
upon
the
events
how
would
you
interpret
the
mt
masada
events
blame
the
jews
what
the
heck
did
the
romans
do
there
anyway
what
business
did
the
atffbi
has
in
waco
texas
the
branch
davidians
never
posed
any
threat
to
society
this
is
like
asking
who
really
caused
the
deaths
of
the
israeli
olympic
team
in
in
that
case
the
police
botched
the
job
as
well
but
to
lay
a
heavier
burden
on
them
than
the
terrorists
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
i
think
the
same
sort
of
reasoning
applies
in
this
case
certainly
if
david
koresh
chose
any
peaceful
option
the
atf
and
fbi
would
have
complied
the
responsibility
is
more
his
than
the
authorities
come
now
at
issue
is
in
how
much
the
authorities
escalated
an
otherwise
peaceful
standoff
lets
get
it
over
with
and
force
david
koresh
to
come
out
by
gassing
them
were
they
naive
or
what
they
played
right
into
the
hands
of
an
apocalypticthinking
individual
he
had
prepared
his
people
for
this
eventuality
for
years
and
not
one
firetruck
or
plan
was
in
place
to
deal
with
this
scenario
i
feel
that
the
authorities
had
some
responsibility
to
protect
their
own
citizens
even
if
they
were
religious
zealots
and
guilty
of
not
paying
a
gun
license
has
the
batf
become
an
extension
of
the
local
taxcollectors
david
koresh
no
doubt
will
be
described
as
the
evil
guy
by
the
executioners
while
the
actions
of
all
those
valiant
and
brave
officers
characterizing
the
atffbi
as
executioners
is
inaccurate
and
unfair
in
order
to
be
an
executioner
the
least
one
must
have
done
is
have
the
intent
to
kill
que
intrusion
into
private
property
with
semis
loaded
with
life
ammunition
isnt
that
implicit
intent
or
at
least
prepared
to
kill
i
ask
you
would
the
batf
warrant
stand
up
in
a
civil
court
of
justice
i
do
not
mind
if
criminals
such
as
dangerous
drug
lords
are
brought
to
justice
but
escalating
events
to
the
point
of
allowing
to
if
not
compli

id
clear
up
a
few
of
the
murky
areas
actually
after
surviving
being
driven
out
of
nauvoo
and
later
carthage
the
mormons
did
fortify
utah
they
still
arm
themselves
to
defend
the
faith
and
stockpile
food
as
well
they
have
been
involved
in
quite
a
lot
of
illegal
activity
including
multiple
and
often
underage
wives
for
the
leaders
a
practice
still
in
vogue
with
some
splinters
of
their
sect
the
parallels
between
koresh
and
joseph
smith
are
striking
by
they
you
mean
the
leaders
of
the
lds
church
i
grant
you
that
when
joseph
smith
was
still
alive
plenty
of
accusations
were
filed
most
of
which
had
little
bearing
with
reality
as
evidenced
by
various
verdicts
i
have
studied
lds
history
for
years
now
and
i
have
yet
to
see
prove
that
the
lds
leadership
was
involved
in
quote
illegal
activities
plural
marriage
yes
but
your
charge
of
underage
wives
sounds
like
it
could
have
originated
from
a
tabloid
and
discredits
the
high
moral
standards
which
characterized
these
leaders
and
families
unlike
as
it
appears
those
of
david
koresh
joseph
smith
started
the
sect
after
he
and
his
brother
hyram
were
murdered
in
a
nauvoo
il
jail
cell
church
membership
split
over
who
to
follow
initially
smith
was
considered
a
prophet
just
like
mohammed
a
rather
interesting
parallel
considering
muslims
consider
christ
to
be
a
prophet
the
same
as
jews
im
led
to
understand
make
no
mistake
this
was
no
messiah
were
talking
about
in
smith
the
and
neither
did
he
claim
he
was
as
the
church
reflects
the
moral
aptitude
of
its
leaders
and
especially
those
of
joseph
smith
i
have
nothing
but
the
highest
respect
for
this
inspired
man
whose
only
crime
was
that
he
refused
to
deny
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
many
have
tried
to
explain
the
smith
phenomenon
away
but
the
bold
presence
of
an
million
member
strong
church
stands
as
a
witness
that
joseph
smiths
testimony
had
enough
resilience
and
power
to
carry
on
the
message
thought
at
the
time
was
that
the
gift
of
prophecy
was
to
be
handed
down
father
to
son
after
joseph
smith
died
his
son
was
only
entering
his
teens
brigham
young
and
a
few
others
claimed
to
have
been
bequeathed
the
gift
and
leadership
prior
to
his
death
the
council
of
twelve
the
church
governing
body
wasnt
of
much
help
here
and
this
basic
conflict
is
still
a
wedge
between
the
sects
brigham
young
took
his
followers
to
salt
lake
the
rest
waited
for
smith
jr
to
grow
up
enough
to
assume
leadership
the
other
claimants
to
the
leadership
were
soon
ignored
like
mike
dukakis
the
rest
were
apostates
and
excommunicated
members
of
the
church
while
the
great
majority
of
the
membership
the
twelve
and
the
various
auxiliary
organizations
chose
to
accept
brigham
young
as
the
new
prophet
and
leader
of
the
church
if
you
knew
your
lds
scriptures
and
doctrine
you
would
have
known
that
brigham
young
was
the
first
in
line
to
fill
the
prophet
joseph
smiths
vacancy
he
was
the
senior
apostle
in
the
quorum
and
various
comments
made
by
joseph
indicated
that
it
was
brigham
who
would
lead
the
latterday
exodus
to
the
west
other
rightful
heirs
were
either
dead
hyrum
smith
or
excommunicated
oliver
cowdery
and
while
persecutions
abounded
and
intensified
joseph
smith
had
already
given
orders
to
look
for
a
new
place
an
empty
land
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
this
rekhabite
principle
pseudographia
was
well
understood
and
antipated
by
the
great
majority
of
lds
faithful
and
was
not
questioned
by
them
granted
a
couple
of
doityourselfers
stayed
behind
unwilling
to
sacrifice
and
to
undertake
the
perilous
journey
to
the
unknown
but
this
also
was
necessary
to
separate
the
tares
from
the
wheat
the
church
benefitted
from
this
purification
process
they
became
even
more
unified
and
willing
to
carry
out
their
mission
to
the
world
both
sects
practiced
the
food
stockpile
doctrine
and
this
being
frontier
and
farming
country
most
carried
or
at
least
owned
weapons
there
is
little
evidence
that
they
were
a
militaristic
sect
given
that
they
tended
to
move
on
rather
than
face
largescale
opposition
brigham
young
having
suffered
a
great
deal
getting
to
salt
lake
seems
to
have
been
quite
justified
in
making
military
training
a
good
thing
remember
this
was
far
beyond
where
even
the
us
army
went
and
these
people
had
nobody
to
turn
to
save
themselves
just
a
little
context
to
put
this
all
in
perspective
btw
since
when
is
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
one
of
the
largest
denominations
in
the
country
a
sect
it
didnt
splinter
from
any
other
religion
as
did
say
the
southern
baptists
or
methodists
so
what
did
the
mormons
get
it
seems
that
j
edgar
hoover
was
very
impressed
with
the
way
they
kept
secrets
theyre
pledged
to
defend
secrets
with
their
lives
and
atone
for
sin
with
blood
many
actually
do
even
to
the
point
of
suicide
what
a
balloney
suicide
is
sinful
and
against
the
law
of
god
i
am
not
comfortable
with
this
alleged
cosiness
with
mammon
i
assure
you
that
many
among
us
reject
this
attitude
categorically
period
our
only
true
allegiance
is
to
our
god
and
to
the
leaders
which
he
has
appointed
to
represent
him
in
any
regard
to
read
this
trash
about
suicide
and
atone
for
sins
with
blood
is
yet
another
insulting
misrepresentation
of
what
my
church
believes
in
and
stands
for
the
rlds
the
reorganized
lds
are
friendly
rivals
of
the
lds
and
delight
in
telling
stories
about
them
which
generates
quick
retorts
from
the
lds
members
and
everybody
has
a
grand
time
at
no
time
have
i
ever
even
heard
this
hinted
at
im
taking
it
with
a
salt
block
make
it
a
really
big
salt
mountain
with
a
glacier
on
top
so
he
hired
virtually
no
one
but
mormons
until
the
fbi
was
almost
exclusively
staffed
by
members
of
the
church
of
later
day
saints
though
j
edgar
is
finally
gone
the
fbi
personnel
especially
the
field
agents
are
still
heavily
mormon
i
have
often
wondered
how
this
might
affect
the
fbis
treatment
of
religious
organizations
a
mormon
would
consider
heretical
preposterous
even
if
this
were
true
reliable
data
please
i
am
convinced
that
those
officers
would
perform
to
the
highest
codes
of
honor
and
conduct
thats
why
they
were
selected
for
in
the
first
place
remember
besides
one
of
our
articles
of
faith
strongly
states
the
principle
of
freedom
of
religion
and
that
all
people
are
free
to
worship
how
where
or
what
they
may
if
its
true
there
would
be
little
affect
lds
and
rlds
philosophy
is
that
all
other
religions
have
strayed
from
the
true
church
as
set
down
by
jesus
but
that
god
will
judge
each
on
his
own
merits
in
addition
the
rlds
also
contend
and
the
lds
may
as
well
that
ignorance
of
the
true
way
tm
is
an
excuse
you
can
only
be
condemned
if
you
had
been
tought
the
way
and
rejected
it
in
short
lds
and
rlds
suffer
everybody
from
lutherans
to
buddhists
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
though
they
are
wrong
they
will
not
be
penalized
for
ignorance
it
is
more
likely
that
hoover
liked
them
because
of
their
rather
strict
upbringings
which
forbade
alcohol
tobacco
hot
drink
like
coffee
or
tea
and
the
like
these
people
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
as
such
are
more
easily
made
to
follow
orders
and
have
few
vices
to
be
used
against
them
a
good
explanation
i
can
accept
that
you
are
right
that
lds
people
are
sometimes
a
little
too
cosy
with
mammons
orders
the
late
president
kimball
for
example
was
an
exception
with
his
strong
opposition
of
the
selection
of
the
mx
peace
keeper
missile
maze
in
utah
thats
my
somewhat
educated
guess
anyway
both
sects
have
splinter
groups
that
dont
mirror
the
masses
but
these
are
small
and
rare
and
hardly
worth
noting
their
common
ancestry
none
of
this
has
any
relevance
to
guns
though
when
a
mans
religion
is
used
to
deny
him
the
right
of
selfprotection

were
insisting

the

their

could

been
accused
of
a

inconsistantly
over
the
last
two
months
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
one
i
had
heard
child
abuse
but
this
is
somewhat
stronger
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
koresh
was
hiding
behind
the
children
and
ironicly
considering
his
apocalyptic
dread
believed
enough
in
the
american
peoples
inherent
goodness
to
believe
he
was
protected
it
is
truly
amazing
that
all
these
people
who
days

had
never
heard
of
the
branch
davidian
now
believe
that
he
was
suicidal
crazy
a
child
abuser

a
immenant
danger

others

what

by

scholar
i
mean

is

and
others
ive
seen
this
claim
about
the
josephus
insert
flying
around
the
net
too
often
to
continue
to
ignore
it
perhaps
its
true
was
there
only
one
josephus
manuscipt
if
there
were
say
copies
the
forger
would
have
to
put
his
insert
into
all
of
them
by
the
same
token
since
josephus
was
a
historian
why
are
biblical
scholars
raising
the
flag
historical
scholars
i
would
think
would
have
a
better
handle
on
these
ancient
secular
documents
can
you
give
researchers
documents
page
numbers
etc
jack
i
became
aware
of
the
claim
years
ago
so
i
decided
to
check
it
out
on
my
own
but
then
that
was
in
bn
times
before
net
so
here
are
some
references
see
robin
lane
foxs
the
unauthorized

where
lane
fox
writes
the

passage
which
appears
to
comment
on
jesus
career
is
agreed
to
be
a
christian
addition
in
my
realbert
sabin
response
to
jim
lippard
april
i
noted
that
consensus
is
typically
indicated
subtly
as
in
elaine
pagels
the
gnostic
gospels
to
wit
a
comment
attributed
to
josephus
reports
emphasis
mine
scholars
sometimes
do
not
even
mention
the
two
josephus
entries
another
subtlety
reflecting
consensus
so
far
as
i
can
deduce
todays
consensus
is
built
on
at
least
three
things
the
long
passage
is
way
out
of
context
origen
did
not
know
about
the
long
passage
and
the
short
and
long
passages
are
contradictory
i
dont
know
the
references
wherein
the
arguments
which
led
to
consensus
are
orginally
developed
does
anyone
biblical
scholars
as
i
defined
them
include
theologians
and
historians
the
former
like
the
latter
incorporate
historical
social
technological
and
ideological
contexts
as
well
as
theology
so
the
distinction
is
blurred
i

jesus
changed

fact
by
now
making

applicable

all
people

how
many

have
you
put
to

for

if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
if
youll
notice
he
also
reams
into
the
pharisees
for
mucking
up
the
law
with
their
own
contrived
interpretations
they
knew
every
letter
of
the
law
and
followed
it
with
their
heads
but
not
their
hearts
that
is
why
he
points
out
that
our
righteousness
must
surpass
that
of
the
pharisees
in
order
to
be
accepted
into
the
kingdom
of

people
such

in

david
whitten
i
wrote
there
evidently
was
a
feast
of
bread
and
wine
associated
with
mithras
i
have
often
wondered
if
yeshua
intentionally
introduced
this
ritual
to
expand
the
appeal
of
his
religion
or
if
it
was
appropriated
by
later
worshipers
and
you
responded
you
could
argue
that
if
you
wanted
but
i
think
a
more
reasonable
argument
would
point
out
the
fact
that
the
remembrance
feast
was
very
similar
to
the
pesach
passover
meal
during
seder
a
very
jewish
ritual
of
course
the
feast
was
the
seder
and
the
accounts
of
it
are
very
clear
on
this
point
the
difference
is
the
connection
between
the
bread
and
wine
and
the
body
and
blood
of
god
this
is
an
old
association
of
the
tammuzosirismithras
line
and
not
really
related
to
judaism
in
any
case
i
didnt
really
intend
to
argue
the
point
i
saw
a
possible
association
and
pointed
it
out

can
be
both
affirmative

both
carry
an

they

both
asserting

a

the
default
condition
in
the
absence

either

is
that

the

simply

is
the
only

who

this
is
why
the
socalled

position
is
virtually
unassailable
not
because
it
stands
on
a
firm
foundation
of

but
because
its
proponents
simply
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of

and
therefore
they
hold
no
burden
of
proof
when
you
dont
assert
anything
you
dont
have
to
prove
anything
thats
where
weak

draws
its

its

is
also
its

i
think
we
do
agree
given
your
clarification
of
how
we
were
each
using
the
terms
fact
and
theory
ill
only
add
that
i
think
perhaps
i
feel
more
strongly
about
separating
them
though
your
usage
is
quite
valid
note
that
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
in
other
words
it
could
theoretically
still
be
falsified
and
rejected
but
since
its
so
predictive
and
so
consistently
supported
by
evidence
it
seems
pointless
to
explicitly
try
to
falsify
it
anymore
ill
add
here
that
any
falsification
or
rejection
does
not
in
any
way
reduce
its
current
usefulness
so
long
as
it
accurately
predicts
or
describes
things
we
can
observe
not
to
be
a
pain
in
the
ass
but
is
there
any
reason
you
dont
just
say
the
theory
of
evolution
rather
than
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
im
asking
because
this
whole
thread
got
started
because
i
was
bothered
by
a
post
that
referred
to
the
fact
of
evolution
basically
leaving
off
the
phrase
is
still
a
theory
without
a
clarification
like
the
one
you
just
gave
just
saying
the
fact
of
evolution
has
a
very
different
meaning
to
me
description

both
are
very
useful
models
that
have
no

unless
of

you
want
to
demand
that
it
is
a
factual
physical
entity
described
exactly
the
way
the
theory
now
formulated
talks
about
it
here
is
where
you
fail
to
make
an
important
distinction
you
have
shoehorned
the
facts
of
the
existence
of
gravity
and
atoms
and
evolution
into
one
category
with
the
theories
which
have
been
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
the
existence
of
these
things
is
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
the
mechanisms
on
the
other
hand
are
still
worth
discussing
im
not
sure
i
agree
here
again
it
may
be
because
i
feel
stronger
about
separating
terms
i
was
trying
to
say
that
the
theories
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
and
the
mechanisms
themselves
are
the
only
realities
here
it
is
the
existence
of
mechanisms
not
the
things
themselves
that
are
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
as
you
would
say
there
arent
really
little
planetary
particle
systems
called
atoms
out
there
or
i
should
say
and
more
to
my
original
point
it
would
be
a
leap
of
faith
to
say
there
are
because
we
observe
only
the
mechanisms
there
is
no
need
to
believe
there
are
actually
atoms
out
there
as
we
have
decided
to
think
about
them
its
enough
to
discuss
the
mechanisms
at
any
rate
im
not
sure
i
am
being
any
clearer
than
before
but
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
shot
the
bottom
line
though
is
i
think
we
agree
on
two
fundamental
ideas
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
my
way
the
fact
of
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
your
way
creation
is
just
an
opinion
if
a
theist
wants
to
call
it
a
theory
then
he
can
i
wont
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
and
it
neither
predicts
nor
supports
any
observations
that
can
be
made
with
no
mechanisms
to
talk
about
there
really
isnt
much

be
exactly
literally
true
for
those
people
the
existence
of
tyre
is
a
problem
for
me
it
is
not
turning
to
the
latest
person
trying
to
defend
ezekiel
we
read
this
from
john
e
king
the
prophesy
clearly
implies
that
people
would
still
be
living
in
the
area
no
it
implies
nothing
of
the
kind
if
you
had
nothing
but
the
prophecy
from
ezekiel
and
you
were
told
you
interpret
it
literally
you
would
never
say
oh
he
means
that
there
will
be
houses
and
businesses
and
plants
and
stuff
like
that
you
would
read
i
will
make
you
a
bare
rock
and
you
will
never
be
rebuilt
and
youd
conclude
that
tyre
would
be
a
bare
rock
the
only
way
to
get
from
fishing
nets
to
houses
and
buildings
and
a
mediumlarge
population
is
if
you
know
that
all
that
latter
stuff
is
there
in
other
words
your
answer
means
that
ezekiel
misled
everybody
who
read
the
prophecy
at
the
time
it
was
written
there
is
no
way
that
given
a
literal
reading
they
could
read
this
passage
and
conclude
mediumsize
city
you
seem
to
feel
that
never
be
rebuilt
means
be
rebuilt
maybe
so
but
it
is
hardly
a
clear
implication
mr
king
also
writes
so
far
ive
seen
stated
figurers
ranging
from
to
lets
assume
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standards
we
are
talking
about
a
onehorse
town
well
no
thats
only
a
bit
less
than
the
population
of
annapolis
where
im
from
you
know
the
naval
acadamy
the
state
capital
george
washington
resigned
his
commission
in
the
statehouse
annapolis
may
not
be
new
york
but
its
at
least
a
twohorse
town
but
supposing
people
is
a
small
town
its
still
people
more
than
ezekiel
predicted
and
youve
said
nothing
about
the
other
problem
in
chapter
ezekiel
predicts
that
nebuchadnezzar
will
will
destroy
tyre
and
loot
all
their
valuables
however
nebuchadnezzar
did
not
destroy
tyre
and
in
chapter
ezekiel
even
quotes
god
as
saying
he
and
his
army
got
no
reward
from
the
campaign
he
led
against
tyre
lets
ignore
alexander
for
a
moment
and
just
pay
attention
to
chapter
ezekiel
says
n
would
destroy
tyre
and
n
did
not
destroy
tyre
ezekiel
says
that
n
would
plunder
their
valuables
but
n
did
not
plunder
their
valuables
regardless
of
what
you
think
about
tyre
now
the
fact
is
that
n
died
before
the
place
was
destroyed
ezekiel
said
n
was
going
to
do
it
and
n
did
not
this
post
is
of
course
pointless
inerrantists
have
an
amazing
ability
to
rewrite
the
bible
as
needed
to
fit
whatever
they
want
it
to
say
for
example
i
expect
mr
king
to
respond
to
the
comments
about
ezekiel
by
pulling
some
clear
implications
out
of
hat
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
towers
that
clearly
implied
that
the
walls
would
still
be
standing
so
people
would
know
where
the
towers
used
to
be
and
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
fine
houses
and
throw
your
stones
timber
and
rubble
into
the
sea
that
clearly
implied
that
n
would
never
set
foot
on
the
island
and
when
ezekiel
wrote
that
n
would
build
a
ramp
up
to
your
walls
that
clearly
implies
that
n
would
spend
years
stomping
around
on
the
mainland
and
never
get
close
to
the
walls
see
a
few
clear
implications
that
are
totally
contrary
to
the
text

why

the

was
put

for

we
must

bc
look
the

has

for

look
i
have
a

about
how
it
was
actually
created

a

several

actually

bc
look
are
you

you

that
youre

youll

better
to

on

than
to
live
an

off

besides
youre
just
asking
pointless

you

youre
just

so
we

of

you

delete

a

trips
round

please
notice
that
we
are
only
obliged
to
use
force
to
preserve
self
we
can
choose
not
to
preserve
self
which
is
the
point
of
pacifism
would
you
say
this
of
any
two
statements
one
saying
x
is
moral
and
the
other
saying
x
is
immoral
how
would
you
decided
when
two
statements
x
is
moral
x
is
immoral
actually
conflict
and
when
they
say
effectively
the
same
thing
what
they
prescribe
that
one
should
do
is
a
pretty
good
indicator
and
in
this
case
they
dont
prescribe
the
same
things
so
and
lead
one
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing
then
either
both
statements
are
doublespeak
or
none
they
might
lead
you
to
do
the
same
thing
but
the
difference
is
what
motivates
pacifism
so
they
obviously
dont
lead
pacifists
to
to
the
same
thing
thats
not
true
you
could
formulate
a
pragmatic
belief
in
minimum
force
and
still
be
a
pacifist
if
the
minimum
is
great
but
one
is
always
trying
to
get
as
close
to
force
as
possible
under
that
belief
not
the
same
as
force
is
immoral
period
but
still
tending
to
pacifism
if
you
dont
think
the
use
of
force
is
immoral
why
minimise
its
use

when
are
we
going
to
hear
a
christian
answer
to
this
question
in
paraphrase
on
what
or
whose
authority
do
christians
proclaim
that
they
are
above
the
law
and
above
the
prophets
major
and
minor
and
not
accountable
to
the
ten
commandments
of
which
jesus
clearly
spoke
his
opinion
in
matthew
what
is
the
source
of
this
pseudodoctrine
who
is
the
pseudoteacher
who
is
the
great
deceiver
ok
heres
at
least
one
christians
answer
jesus
was
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
this
context
matthew
makes
sense
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesus
came
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfill
jesus
lived
under
the
jewish
law
however
he
was
the
culmination
of
the
promises
of
the
prophets
he
came
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
and
fully
obey
gods
purposes
verse
says
for
truly
i
say
to
you
until
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pass
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
the
key
to
this
verse
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesus
as
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
accomplished
what
the
law
was
supposed
to
accomplish
verse
whoever
then
annuls
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
so
teaches
others
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keeps
and
teaches
them
he
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesus
teaching
jewish
people
about
living
lives
under
the
law
this
makes
sense
in
general
it
appears
that
jesus
is
responding
to
some
criticism
he
must
have
received
about
doing
away
with
the
law
that
was
not
jesus
intent
at
all
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the
law
as
it
should
be
lived
and
fulfill
the
promises
made
by
god
to
his
people
all
the
way
back
to
eve
gen
serpent
will
bruise
your
heel
but
he
will
bruise
his
head
jesus
appeared
to
be
doing
away
with
the
law
because
he
did
not
honor
the
traditions
of
men
as
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularly
locked
horns
with
the
religious
leaders
of
the
day
because
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rules
only
gods
law
in
the
matthew
passage
jesus
is
defending
his
dedication
to
the
law
and
defending
himself
against
his
accusors
almost
the
entire
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedicated
to
helping
the
jewish
people
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweeping
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduced
by
the
pharasees
and
their
traditions
in
galatians
paul
describes
the
relationship
of
jesus
to
the
law
in
this
way
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custody
under
the
law
being
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
was
later
to
be
revealed
therefore
the
law
has
become
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justified
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
sons
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
i
believe
this
says
that
after
christ
was
revealed
the
law
had
served
its
purpose
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
has
been
fulfilled
as
christ
said
he
would
do
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesus
are
the
same
personality
therefore
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesus
are
based
on
the
same
moral
principles
it
makes
sense
that
many
of
the
principles
in
the
old
law
are
reexpressed
in
christianity
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
christians
relate
to
god
through
christ
not
the
law
it
also
makes
sense
that
new
practices
and
new
symbolisms
were
established
to
represent
the
mysteries

so
are
you
happy
now
when
people
including
innocent
kids
died
today
its
amazing
how
everyone
automatically
blames
one
side
or
the
other
one
thing
for
sure
koresh
will
have
no
chance
to
defend
himself
against
the
statements
lacking
in
fact
or
court
sponsored
verification
made
by
agents
who
participated
in
the
situation
that
killed
him
frankly
speaking
i
dont
care
who
started
this
whole
show
i
just
feel
sad
about
the
children
that
were
trapped
and
had
to
die
for
a
case
that
didnt
have
any
reason
whatsoever
all
mr
koresh
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
release
these
children
could
he
and
the
first
three
that
died
when
guns
ablazing
in
came
the
batf
and
fbi
i
imagine
i
would
have
some
trouble
giving
up
my
children
to
someone
who
had
just
shot
what
two
of
them
nb
it
takes
two
sets
of
guns
in
a
situation
like
this
yes
i
put
the
blame
on
koresh
and
similar
fanatical
religious
leaders
that
think
more
about
their
cause
than
about
keeping
fanatical
those
whowill
not
tolerate
anothers
way
of
life
religious
based
on
emotional
internal
or
otherwise
lacking
in
commonly
defined
scientific
basis
including
legal
ones
such
as
this
old
saw
innocent
untilproven
guilty
not
innocent
until
presumed
guilty
who
is
the
fanatic
note
who
is
dead
this
usually
bespeaks
a
fair
bit
for
the
idea
that
the
other
side
also
had
lethal
weapons
used
fatally
they
are
dead
the
children
at
best
koresh
was
an
asshole
and
the
government
criminally
negligent
in
its
hadniling
of
the
case
at
worst
koresh
and
his
followers
were
innocent
not
brainwashed
guilty
of
illegal
arms
possession
as
yet
unproven
and
murderedd
along
with
children
they
cannot
speak

batffbi
can
and
are
inappropriately
to
the
public
eye
outside
the
bounds
of
their
legal
authorities
read
the
charter
the
constitution
specifies
that
the

convict

the

arm
investigates

that
the

shuld
not

in

a

involved
prior

its

even
where
factually
true
butthen
distoted
or
disseminated
with
intent
to
harm
for
the

of
covering

is

how
guess
what
you
get
to
make
up

on
that
children
out
from
the

im
not
ashamed
of
this
statement
who
created
the

you
should
be
ashamed
of
bypassing
that
its
the
same
damned
literally
comment
made
by
the
folks
in
the
former
yugoslavia
to
justify
ethnic
cleansing
gee
they
had

all
they
had
to
do
was
surrender
to

does
not

the

that

died

that
they
should
not

did
they

the

show
moral
sickness
trying

convict
in

and
you
should
look

if
there

who
ahving

you
may
in

find
that
the

in

has
gone
from

on

your

if
you
rented

which
is
going
down
now
folks
read

its
accurate
in
figures
and
it
bypasses
the
greedy
businessman
and
mankers
who
have
taken
profit
from
the

look

i
think
that
the
consensus
will
become
that
fbiatf
muffed
it
not
merely
because
they
walked
into
an
ambush
on
feb
and
koresh
got
his
prophesy
today
against
their
stated
intentions
but
because
they
played
right
into
polarizing
the
situation
and
not
diffusing
it
koresh
had
set
up
all
the
conditions
of
a
classic
cult
confrontation
and
had
stated
publically
what
the
outcome
would
become
before
or
after
his
kids
were
shot
the
government
upped
the
ante
and
parcipitated
the
conclusion
today
it
does
seem
that
the
fires
were
set
from
within
the
compound
by
the
members
of
the
group
and
not
caused
by
the
cs
gas
or
the
way
it
was
delivered
let
the
subsequent
investigation
shed
light
on
that
suppose
then
why
make
the
comment
that
the
government
had
used
pyrotechnics
and
started
the
fire
the
dividians
still
had
the
decision
to
stay

leave
they
never
intended
as
did

do

the

you

it
bothers
many
other

yes
the

davidians
are

on

they

they

give

a

what

should

like
that
and
get
shot
at
at
the
same
time
nearly
all
of

witness
la
firemen
are
among
our
real
heroes
most
of
the

i
wonder
when
they
were
actually
aasked
to
come
or
if
they
found
out
about
the
fire
over
the
tv
shot
at
by
whom
prove
it
these
people
were
breaking
the
law
i
agree
these
werent
the
best
tactics
when
law
replaces
justice
the
system
is
dying
or
dead
note
that
we
had
a
small
revolution
years
ago
on
this
point
they
probably
should
have
backed
off
pulled
the
perimeter
way
back
and
let
them
sit
there
with
no
media
attention
until
they
decided
to
come
out
the
only
other
alternative
i
see
would
have
been
to
send
in
a
couple
of
special
forces
guys
to
capture
or
assassinate
koresh
but
remember
these
fruit
or
perhaps
just
wait
or
maybeeven
send
in
a
few
agents
who
are
christian
to
sit
down

pray

out

i
would

theory
on

my
theory
is
that
koresh
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
initial
gunbattle
and
died
on
day
of
the
siege
on
day
of
the
siege
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
periodically
appeared
to
his
followers
and
the
fbi
over
the
next
days
living
with
someone
whos
risen
from
the
dead
isnt
easy
as
timmy
batermans
father
in
petsematary
could
attest
so
after
days
they
did
what
baterman
didshot
themselves
and
burned
the
place
to
the
ground
consistent
with
the
facts
isnt
it
did
anyone
actually
see

brian
kendig
says
and
since
i
felt
reasonably
sure
of
myself
i
decided
to
start
analyzing
the
bible
very
closely
that
was
the
catalyst
to
my
break
with
my
faith
though
it
was
a
long
and
difficult
effort
brian
kendig
also
declares
christ
means
chosen
the
person
chosen
to
fulfill
the
prophesies
of
the
old
testament
and
bring
about
a
new
age
of
hope
and
spiritual
growth
for
mankind
christ
is
greek
for
messiah
messiah
means
annointed
one
annoint
means

rub

ie
to
anoint
by
impl
to
consecrate
the
major
prophet
daniel
uses
the
word
messiah
in
daniel
chapter
how
closely
did
you
analyze
the
bible
looks
as
if
you
didnt
get
past
the
first
word
so
was
the
catalyst
to
break
your
faith
the
priests
who
interpreted
the
bible
for
you
did
you
ever
do

did

theists
and
objectivity
can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
ive
often
found
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
theist
will
stick
to
some
kind
of
superstition
when
wondering
about
god
and
his
scriptures
ive
seen
it
in
the
christian
the
jew
the
muslim
and
the
other
theists
alike
all
assume
that
their
mothers
and
fathers
were
right
in
the
aspect
that
a
god
exists
and
with
that
belief
search
for
their
god
occasionally
the
theist
may
switch
religions
or
aspects
of
the
same
religion
but
overall
the
majority
keep
to
the
belief
that
some
creator
was
behind
the
universes
existence
ive
known
muslims
who
were
once
christians
and
vice
versa
ive
known
christians
who
were
once
jewish
and
vice
versa
and
ive
even
known
christians
who
become
hindu
yet
throughout
their
transition
from
one
faith
to
another
theyve
kept
this
belief
in
some
form
of
higher
being
why
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
but
it
doesnt
stop
there
once
the
child
is
able
to
read
for
himself
there
is
an
endeavor
to
inculcate
the
child
the
right
readings
of
scripture
to
concentrate
more
on
the
pleasant
readings
to
gloss
over
the
worse
ones
and
to
explain
away
the
unexplainable
with
mystery
circular
arguments
selfevdent
facts
and
truths
unreasoning
belief
and
fear
of
hell
is
the
meat
of
religion
the
child
must
eat
of
every
day
to
doubt
of
course
means
wrath
of
some
sort
and
the
child
must
learn
to
put
away
his
brain
when
the
matter
concerns
god
all
of
this
has
some
considerable
effect
on
the
child
so
that
when
he
becomes
an
adult
the
superstitions
hes
been
taught
are
nearly
impossible
to
remove
all
of
this
leads
me
to
ask
whether
the
theist
can
truly
be
objective
when
questioning
god
hell
heaven
the
angels
souls
and
all
of
the
rest
can
he
for
a
moment
put
aside
this
notion
that
god
does
exist
and
look
at
everything
from
a
unbiased
point
of
view
obviously
most
theists
can
somewhat
especially
when
presented
with
mythical
gods
homeric
roman
egyptian
etc
but
can
they
put
aside
the
assumption
of
gods
existence
and
question
it

i
use

right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting

speak
to
us
through

this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
luke
records
christs
promise
to
the
repentant
thief
who
hung
on
an
adjacent
cross
truly
i
say
to
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradise
but
was
it
not
until
later
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
to
heaven
if
christ
himself
was
not
in
heaven
until
sunday
how
could
the
repentant
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lies
in
the
location
of
paradise
when
jesus
died
apparently
paradise
was
not
exalted
to
heaven
until
easter
day
jesus
refers
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
story
of
the
rich
man
and
lazarus
as
abrahams
bosom
to
which
the
godly
beggar
lazarus
was
carried
by
the
angels
after
his
decease
luke
thus
abrahams
bosom
referred
to
the
place
where
the
souls
of
the
redeemed
waited
till
the
day
of
christs
resurrection
it
was
not
yet
lifted
to
heaven
but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hades
hebrew
sheol
reserved
for
believers
who
had
died
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admitted
into
the
glorious
presence
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redemption
had
actually
been
paid
on
calvary
or
even
that
none
would
precede
the
presence
of
jesus
back
to
glory
with
the
father
doubtless
it
was
the
infernal
paradise
that
the
souls
of
jesus
and
the
repentant
thief
repaired
after
they
each
died
on
friday
afternoon
but
on
sunday
after
the
risen
christ
had
first
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
john
and
her
two
companions
matthew
presumably
he
then
took
up
with
him
to
glory
all
the
inhabitants
of
infernal
paradise
including
abraham
lazarus
and
the
repentant
thief
we
read
in
ephesians
concerning
christ
ascending
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
he
gave
gifts
unto
men
verse
continues
but
what
does
he
ascended
mean
but
that
he
also
descended
to
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
ie
to
hades
verse
adds
he
who
descended
is
the
same
as
he
who
ascended
above
all
the
heavens
presumably
he
led
the
whole
band
of
liberated
captives
from
hades
ie
the
whole
population
of
preresurrection
paradise
up
to
the
glory
of
heaven
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is

challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in

to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
think
that
this
characterization
is
faulty
whenever
my
personal
interpretation
is

i
usually
give
a
reason
as
for
those
that
see
things
differently
please
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
difference
and
we
can
discuss
it
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there

show
it

the

anything
that
does

cool
enough
youll
have
more
trouble
defining
the
terms
in

statement
than
getting
people
to
agree

for
example
i
perceive
i
have
a
right
not

participate
in
what
i
feel
is
murder
i
dont
think
the
government
should
either
on
the
other
hand
since
we
are
having
trouble
proving
that
it
is
murder
there
is
no
right
to
stop
someone
from
doing
it
if
they
so
choose
either
by
legal
means
or
harassment
of
course
persuasion
is
allowed
but
watch
that
line
between
persuasive
and
harassing
the
second
part
is
a
definition
of
a
person
a
simplistic
explanation
is
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
society
most
normal
adult
human
beings
are
good
examples
of
people
most
children
over
two
years
old
are
people
as
well
the
simple
way
of
determining
this
is
that
you
can
have
a
conversation
with
them
it
is
actually
more
complicated
than
that
but
i
have
no
desire
to
spend
the
time
it
would
take
to
explain
it
to
you
read
the
thread
why
is
bodily
autonomy
so
important
for
more
explanation
and
justification
but
why
is
your
definition
authoritative
enough
for
the
whoe
us
surely
you
can
understand
there
are
other
definitions
with
equal
right
of
consideration
then
please
justify
why
being
human
automatically
makes
something
valuable
and
why
that
includes
the
unborn
if
the
government
refused
to
fun
abortions
due
to
the
qualms
of
a
minority
of
the
population
then
it
would
then
have
to
pay
far
more
in
the
delivery
of
babies
whose
mothers
wanted
an
abortion
but
could
not
afford
one
and
now
that
baby
will
also
require
care
for
years
true
that
needs
to
be
fixed
it
is
part
of
the
problem
if
clinton
has
a
medical
program
to
get
underway
let
him
address
this
too
it
is
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
save
lives
later
they
will
be
productive
members
of
society
at
least
if
his
plan
works
no
they
are
not
guaranteed
to
become
productive
members
of
society
even
if
they
do
that
is
many
years
in
the
futureuntil
which
they
are
a
burden
on
someone
or
society
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
mother
forcing
her
to
carry
a
pregnancy
to
term
at
a
critical
time
in
her
life
could
prevent
her
from
being
a
productive
member
of
society
actually
i
was
refering
to
the
minority
that
objects
to
abortion
not
those
who
object
to
federal
funding
i
admit
i
did
not
say
it
very
clearly
and
apologize
for
that
to
refuse
to
fund
abortions
is
to
remove
that
choice
from
some
women
and
add
the
additional
burden
to
society
for
no
reason
no
this
is
really
flawed
logic
it
would
be
like
me
saying
i
was
born
with
a
disfigured
face
and
i
want
cosmetic
repair
it
is
discriminatory
that
i
cannot
make
that
choice
and
so
you
must
pay
for
it
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
make
a
choice
does
not
imply
legally
or
otherwise
that
someone
else
should
foot
the
bill
sic
for
that
choice
ok
look
its
like
this
we
are
footing
the
bill
maybe
they
will
take
choice
a
maybe
they
will
take
choice
b
maybe
they
will

they
cant

any
one
of

c

that

c
has

even

a

of
money
we
cant
in

refuse

pay

it
now
a
has

is
perfectly
legal

it
hasnt
been
funded
in
the
past
now
a
is
going

be

but
some
people
object
they
dont
like
the
idea
of
their
tax
money
going
to
pay
for
choice
a
so
we
could
refuse
to
fund
a
at
all
then
those
women
who
cant
afford
any
of
those
choices
will
be
forced
to
take
choice
b
or
c
which
will
cost
all
of
us
more
money
most
of

dont

any

at

is
what
the
mother
chooses
we
will
also
still
fund
b
and
even
c
if
that
is
what
the
mother
chooses
however
some
women
will
certainly
choose
a
and
that
will
then
save
us
we
otherwise
would
have
had
to
spend
your
taxes
are
not
being
raised
to
fund
a
choice
you
object
they
are
being
lowered
because
we
will
fund
a
choice
that
is
legal
despite
your
objections
to
it
actually
your
taxes
are
not
really
going
to
go
down
as
im
sure
you
would
point
out
but
the
amount
that
is
saved
in
that
area
can
help
out
in
anotherlike
our
massive
debt
if
you
disagree
then
give
us
some
reasons
given
that
abortion
is
legal
and
the
right
to
abortion
is
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
population
it
is
not
justifiable
to
refuse
abortions
to
women
who
can
not
afford
them
who
will
simply
require
even
greater
funds
for
the
delivery
you
would
force
upon
them
i
refuse
to
pay
more
taxes
to
remove
choice
from
those
women
just
because
you
object
to
a
legal
medical
procedure
what
i
say
objection
to
the
procedure
is
irrelevant
uncle
bill
doesnt
pay
for
breast
augmentation
facelifts
etc
why
abortions
its
elective
surgery
those
other
procedures
you
mention
only
cost
money
there
is
no
savings
in
other
procedures
that
would
be
required
down
the
road
without
them
in
fact
there
could
be
additional
costs
down
the
road
because
of
them
this
is
quite
different
from
the
case
of
abortion
as
for
your
argument
you
are
enticing
a
young
girl
to
kill
a
baby
by
making
it
affordable
and
refusing
to
make
the
alternative
affordable
too
so
you
are
just
as
guilty
of
removing
a
choice
by
withholding
funds
think
about
it
a
poor
girl
is
pregnant
and
abortions
are
federally
funded
whats
she
gonna
do
what
choice
have
your
plans
given
her
your
kind
of
double
talk
really
makes
me
ill
this
is
bullshit
we
are
not
refusing
to
make
the
alternative
affordable
too
if
we
refused
to
pay
for
the
more
expensive
choice
of
birth
then
your
statement
would
make
sense
but
that
is
not
the
case
so
it
doesnt
if
clinton
tried
to
block
funding
for
prenatal
care
and
delivery
or
left
it
out
of
his
healthcare
plan
i
would
certainly
object
i
would
also
be
quite
surprised
prochoice
ha
proabortion
really
fits
in
your
case
yes
but
probably
not
your
definition
of
it
or
for
the
reasons
you
think
if
youre
gonna
fund
one
choice
you
have
to
fund
them
all
at
the
very
least
you
stupid
fuck
we
do
want
to
fund
all
the
choices
you
are
the
one
who
wants
to
not
fund
all
the
choices
imho
if
we
fund
the
adoption
choice
right
meaning
not
just
throwing
money
at
it
but
cutting
costs
esp
legal
costs
we
wont
need
abortion
anymore
your
humble
opinion
is
still
wrong
even
with
easy
adoption
there
is
still
the
fact
that
pregnancy
takes
several
months
months
in
which
a
young
woman
could
need
to
be
getting
an

it
is

for
anyone
to

they
are
not
biologically
independent
nor
was
my
son
at
the
age
of
weeks
he
was
breastfed
and
would
not
take
a
bottle
just
what
does
biologically
independent
mean
ill
be
happy
to
punch
any
definition
full
of
loopholes
he
was
still
biologically
independent
at
least
to
the
same
extent
you
are
now
he
consumed
nutrients
and
digested
them
in
the
normal
manner
he
breathed
his
own
air
a
fetus
on
the
other
hand
gets
its
nutrients
already
digested
by
the
mother
it
gets
its
oxygen
from
the
mother
as
well
that
is
not
biologically
independent
their
awareness
is
questionable
aha
you
admit
it
is
questionable
yet
you
are
willing
to
kill
it
even
if
it
may
be
very
aware
i
suggest
you
rethink
your
viewpoint
awareness
is
only
part
of
what
makes
a
member
of
society
it
is
the
minimal
conceivable
requirement
yet
many
people
seem
to
think
that
something
without
awareness
could
still
be
important
enough
to
justify
the
suffereing
of
a
true
member
of
society
i
keep
asking
but
i
still
havent
seen
a
real
justification
for
why
the
life
of
a
nonsentient
creature
should
be
worth
the
suffering
of
a
sentient
being
i
havent
read
every

i

he
is

naturally
worshipped

slay

to

we
can
choose
not

preserve
self
which
is
the
point
of
pacifism
ok
got
you
i
concede
your
point
though
the
word
obliged
strongly
implies
that
one
must
sometimes
use
force
a
further
rephrasing
would
give
you
the
distinction
you
mention
however
if
i
have
you
right
a

would
not
even
go

unfortunatelyetc
would
you
say
this

any
two

one
saying
x

the
other
saying
x

how
would
you
decided
when
two

x
is
moral
x
is
immoral
actually
conflict
and
when
they
say
effectively
the
same
thing
what
they
prescribe
that
one
should
do
is
a
pretty
good
indicator
and
in
this
case
they
dont
prescribe
the
same
things
so
yes
fair
enough
though
why
confuse
things
by
saying
that
one
is
somtimes
obliged
if
the
real
meaning
is
that
one
is
never
obliged
and
lead
one
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing
then
either
both
statements
are
doublespeak
or
none
they
might
lead
you
to
do
the
same
thing
but
the
difference
is
what
motivates
pacifism
so
they
obviously
dont
lead
pacifists
to
to
the
same
thing
thats
not
true
you
could
formulate
a
pragmatic
belief
in
minimum
force
and
still
be
a
pacifist
if
the
minimum
is
great
but
one
is
always
trying
to
get
as
close
to
force
as
possible
under
that
belief
not
the
same
as
force
is
immoral
period
but
still
tending
to
pacifism
if
you
dont
think
the
use
of
force
is
immoral
why
minimise
its
use
if
you
dont

that
it

would
really
hate
to
base
my
knowledge
of

qm
on
what
the
overwhelming
popular
opinion
is
the
basis
eric
is
people
peering
at
the
world
and
saying
what
they
see
im
talking
about
uninterpreted
facts
observations
people
do
those
agreement
on
some
observations
is
a
prerequisite
for
a
theory
that
is
more
than
personal
yes
thats
true
but
you
have
to
be
clear
exactly
what
is
an
uninterpreted
observation
its
pretty
low
level
stuff
the
sun
shines
is
already
a
lot
higher
level
than
that
we
can
agree
that
i
perceive
brightness
perhaps
now
i
take
an
experience
of
goodevil
to
be
every
bit
as
raw
a
fact
as
an
experience
of
pain
or
vision
that
might
seem
like
a
good
first
pass
guess
but
it
turns
out
to
be
a
pretty
cruddy
way
to
look
at
things
because
we
all
seem
to
have
rather
different
opinions
experiences
about
what
is
good
and
evil
while
we
seem
to
be
able
to
agree
on
what
the
meter
says
youre
not
comparing
apples
with
apples
if
we
all
look
at
the
same
meter
well
agree
if
were
all
in
the
same
situation
thats
when
well
agree
on
fundamental
values
if
at
all
people
who
say
that
nobody
agrees
on
values
to
the
same
extent
that
they
agree
on
trivial
observations
seem
to
be
unaware
of
the
extent
of
agreement
on
either
huh
what
do
you
mean
all
in
the
same
situation
lets
take
me
and
dennis
kriz
as
examples
were
in
pretty
different
situations
but
i
think
we
can
agree
as
to
whether
its
day
or
night
i
dont
think
we
can
agree
as
to
whether
or
not
abortion
is
morally
acceptable
yet
we
are
certainly
in
the
same
difference
of
situations
with
respect
to
each
other
looks
like
weaselwords
to
me
frank
i
dont
see
that
its
any
evidence
at
all
as
i
point
out
above
im
really
not
interested
very
much
in
what
the
popular
opinion
is
im
prepared
to
trustto
some
extent
the
popular
opinion
about
direct
matters
of
physical
observation
because
by
and
large
they
accord
with
my
own
however
if
everyone
else
said
the
dial
read
and
it
looked
like
a
to
me
i
would
hope
that
i
would
believe
myself
ie
believing
other
people
about
these
matters
seems
to
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
predicting
what
i
would
believe
if
i
observed
myself
but
the
possibility
exists
that
it
is
not
since
i
know
from
observation
that
others
disagree
with
me
about
what
is
good
i
believe
i
can
discount
popular
opinion
about
good
from
the
beginning
as
a
predictor
of
my
opinion
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
get
people
to
agree
on
what
is
good
in
a
really
large
number
of
situations
is
probably
the
best
evidence
that
objective
morality
is
bogus
actually
firstly
if
everyone
else
said
the
dial
was
and
i
saw
id
check
my
lens
prescription
thats
up
to
you
i
guess
secondly
your
observation
that
people
disagree
shows
nothing
people
may
be
looking
at
different
things
by
virtue
of
being
in
different
situations
if
i
look
at
an
elephant
ill
see
an
elephant
that
doesnt
imply
that
you
will
see
an
elephant
if
you
look
at
an
iguana
this
different
situations
stuff
is
pretty
confusing
frank
how
do
we
decide
if
we
are
in
the
same
situation
you
mind
explaining
thirdly
i
question
your
assumption
that
when
people
disagree
about
how
to
achieve
fundamental
or
secondary
goals
that
they
therefore
do
not
have
the
same
fundamental
goals
that
seems
to
be
the
disagreement
you
refer
to
huh
i
dont
think
so
i
think
that
people
disagree
about
fundamental
goals

the

albert

i

no

maybe
the

i

can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
i
think
that
if
a
theist
were
truly
objective
and
throws
out
the
notion
that
god
definitely
exists
and
starts
from
scratch
to
prove
to
themselves
that
the
scriptures
are
the
whole
truth
then
that
person
would
no
longer
be
a
theist
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
youre
missing
something
here
there
are
people
who
convert
from
nontheism
to
theism
after
being
brought
up
in
a
nontheist
household
i
dont
have
any
statistics
as
to
how
many
though
that
would
be
an
interesting
thing
to
know
i
think
that
religion
is
a
crutch
people
are
naturally
afraid
of
the
unknown
and
the
unexplainable
people
dont
want
to
believe
that
when
they
die
they
are
dead
finished
that
there
is
nothing
else
after
that
and
so
religion
is
kind
of
a
nice
fantasy
religion
also
describes
things
we
dont
know
about
the
universe
things
science
has
not
yet
described
and
it
also
gives
people
a
feeling
of
security
that
if
they
just
do
this
one
thing
and
everything
will
be
ok
that
they
are
being
watched
over
by
a
higher
power
and
its
minions
this
has
a
very
high
psychological
attraction
for
quite
a
few
people
and
these
people
are
willing
to
put
up
with
a
few
discrepancies
and
holes
in
their
belief
system
for
what
it
gains
them
this
is
why
i
think
its
kind
of
useless
to
try
too
hard
to
convert
theists
to
atheism
they
are
happy
with
their
fantasy
and
they
feel
that
other
people
will
be
happy
with
it
too
they
cant
accept
the
fact
that
there
are
people
who
would
rather
accept
the
harsh
reality
that
they
are
running
from
anyway
im
getting
kind
of
carried
away
here
but
my
point
is
that
theism
doesnt
have
to
be
ingrained
into
a
childs
mindset
for
that
person
to
grow
up
as
a
theist
although
this
happens
far
too
often
theism
is
designed
to
have
its
own
attractions

conscience
from
writing
a
more
considered
response
and
fully
entering
the
fray
as
it
were
let
me
then
say
what
i
can
briefly
the
two
commandments
are
rules
they
are
merely
rules
that
are
so
vague
that
they
are
practically
devoid
of
meaning
this
point
for
the
netbrowsers
who
also
still
read
books
is
pursued
throughly
in
kaufmann
critiqueofreligionandphilosophy
the
commandment
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
can
be
viewed
in
part
as
reminding
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
cannot
act
as
if
he
has
ultimate
responsibility
this
is
a
theological
statement
worthy
of
barth
dr
turpin
dd
may
wear
the
black
robe
of
geneva
yet
indeed
many
traditions
present
an
interpretation
where
believers
are
supposed
to
interpret
loving
ones
neighbor
as
following
various
other
rules
and
relying
on
their
god
to
make
things
come
out
right
precisely
because
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assume
such
ultimate
responsibility
once
again
we
are
confronted
with
good
sounding
goo
that
means
whatever
the
reader
wants
it
to
mean
this
requires
the
assumption
that
all
interpretations
are
equally
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reasonably
distinguishing
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumption
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
michael
and
i
and
others
read
the
bible
with
christian
glasses
among
the
things
that
this
should
imply
is
that
the
nt
informs
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
dominanting
it
some
points
in
the
ot
ceremonial
dietary
laws
are
explicitly
abrogated
by
the

texts
to
drive
russell

point
with
adequacy
one
needs
to
begin
with
nt
texts
probably
from
matthew
and
probably
about
damnation

trying

i
take

seriously
no
michael
the

christians
also
take
the

seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret

russell

no

is
misplaced
not

inappropriate
michaels
selfdescription
much
govern
the
equation

radical

which
seems
implied

is

are

why

i

tell

something

gets

heart

hearts
so
my
metaphor
is
not
mixed
just
extraterrestrial
russell
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michaels
theological
positions
actually
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christianity
dean
simeon
responds
this
time
gently
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhaps
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibly
mean
the
implied
rhetorical
effort
to
separate
michael
from
the
tradition
is
a
failure
michael
is
in
the
tradition
if
your
idea
of
the
tradition
doesnt
include
him
change
your
idea
of
the
tradition
the
irony
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
christianity
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
cause
of
lesbians
and
gays
how
can
one
answer
this
while
staying
on
the
more
general
issue
im
on
the
other
side
of
the
interpretive
fence
from
michael
on
this
issue
yet
nothing
is
a
hideous
overstatement
one
verse
is
enough
to
refute
it
ill
offer
two
from
paul
of
all
people
in
jesus
christ
there
is
neither
male
nor
femalegalatians
i
dont
quote
single
verses
as
a
rule
and
i
dont
carry
them
in
my
head
and
nothing
shall
separate
us
from
the
glory
of
god
roughly
from
romans
if
russell
would
promise
to
convert
based
on
these
or
any
other
verses
id
promise
to
get
the
full
context
for
any
that
he
requires
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
this
conclusion
does
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goes
before
a
surprising
logical
ellipsis

hillary
says
he

molesting
infants
so
it
must
be
true
even
though
such
allegations
do
not
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
they
are
state
and
local
matters
and
have
been
thoroughly
reviewed
at
the
local
level
by
proper
authorities
with
no
successful
charge
having
ever
been
levied
against
him
under
american
law
he
was
innocent
as
americans
are
presumed
innocent
until
proven
guilty
at
least
thats
how
it
is
suppposed
to
be
but
he
was
demonized
and
propa
gandized
against
by
a
powerful
machine
to
have
him
appear
as
a
lustful
beast
and
therefore
deserving
of
every
ill
the
fates
might
bring
upon
him
but
evidence
trickles
in
that
the
twentyone
children
who
left
the
building
in
the
early
days
of
the
siege
were
carefully
examined
by
qualified
authorities
for
evidence
of
physical
or
sexual
abuse
and
none
was
found
deguerin
one
of
the
attorneys
who
met
with
davidians
several
times
before
the
conflagration
reported
that
the
children
seemed
well
adjusted
and
showed
no
sign
of
abuse
ultimately
steve
what
i
think
about
the
heart
of
david
koresh
is
quite
unimportant
today
he
is
in
the
benevolent
hands
of
a
most
wise
and
merciful
judge
who
will
one
day
surely
judge
us
all
so
i
withhold
any
judgment
of
david
koresh
and
defer
to
the
one
who
has
all
knowledge
meanwhile
lets
clean
up
the
mess
left
on
earth
and
keep
this
from
happening

sending
a
strong

respect
the
inalienable

joe

i
remain

himself

i

i
hope
your

does
a
very
thorough
investigation
of
the
whole
debacle
and
ill
be
disappointed
if
a

heads

in

always

there

of

in

infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according

his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in

matter

die

is

to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
body
and
being
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you

you
mean
members

a
group
that
calls

rosicrucian
at

that
is
what
your

response
this
makes
much
sense
to
me
this
is
also
true

most

is
a
difference
between
being
a

a
group
of
people
who
call
themselves
hindus

christians

and
actually
being
any
of
these
the
social
groups
tend
to
make
very
important
requirements

not

other
religions
i
find
that
the
ideal
described
by
the
holy
texts
of
most

can
be
interpreted
in
very
similar
ways
so
that
one
could
presume
that

is
the

is
the

certainly

didnt

ive

tony
youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatever
had
been
presented
by

it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have

impression
ie
youd
probably
have
had
a
positive
impression
more
likely
than
a
negative
one
imho
response
this
may
be
slightly
off
ive
met
some
of
these
rosicrucians
and
have
a
couple
friends
in
amorc
the
stories
ive
heard
and
the
slight
contact
ive
had
with

does
not
give
me
the

that

with

of

i
still
like
to
think
that
most
people
who
are
involved
with
stratified
relationships
monogamy
religion
etc
are
in
deep
pain
and
hope
to

it
within

a

tony
it
is

to
know
that

id

at

the
addresses
of

which
call
themselves

and
especially
those
which
are

is
this

who

dont

nothing

robert

says
orthodox
is
a
compound
word
it
comes
from
orthos
straight
true
right
and
from
doxa
opinion
doctrine
teaching
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teaching
right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting
god
speak
to
us
through
the
bible
this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
thanks
for
the
etymology
lesson
but
i
actually
know
what
orthodox
means
youre
avoiding
my
question
however
which
was
from
what
body
of
theology
does
your
version
of
orthodoxy
come
you
seem
to
simply
be
saying
that
whatever
you
understand
the
bible
to
say
is
orthodox
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
you
are
obviously
mistaken
since
many
many
people
have
read
the
bible
and
many
do
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point
once
again
robert
is
your
interpretation
the
only
correct
or
orthodox
one
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
ra
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
this
whole
string
began
as
a
response
to
your
attacks
on
mormonism
no
one
is
attacking
your
personal
beliefs
only
your
tendency
to
present
them
as
orthodoxy
i
dont
much
care
what
you
believe
about
the
bible
just
dont
present
you
personal
understanding
as
the
only
orthodox
one
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there
are
other
views
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scripture
and
then
we
can
go
on
i
have
never
attacked
your
specific
beliefs
thats
your
approach
remember
stating
that
other
people
who
depend
solely
on
the
bible
have
other
views
is
indeed
proof
that
the
bible
can
be
interpreted
many
ways
which
has
been
my
whole
point
all
along
the
specifics
of
your
belief
are
your
business
just
dont
pretend
that
they
are
anything
more
than
your
personal
intepretation
and
be
careful
about
crying
heresy
based
on
your
private
belief
system

yes
in

in

what

theres

what

hmm
the
police
strategy
of
bursting
in
with
weapons
drawn
clearly
marked
as
officers
and
yelling
police
repeatedly
this
is
used
every
day
to
bust
drug
houses
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspects
into
submission
with
surprise
and
display
of
firepowere
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
as
for
not
knocking
its
a
sad
necessity
in
many
cases
since
the
suspects
will
attempt
to
escape
or
even
fight
usually
this
strategy
works
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
used
so
commonly
now
would
it
in
general
noknock
raids
are
to
preserve
evidence
like
drugs
which
can
be
flushed
down
the
toilet
they
are
not
the
standard
way
to
arrest
a
violent
felon
like
a
bank
robber
if
there
is
no
need
to
search
or
preserve
evidence
they
will
just
surround
the
dwelling
and
order
the
suspect
to
come
out
with
her
hands
up
if
the
suspect
does
not
come
out
tear
gas
will
be
used
comment
on
the
bd
omitted
i
merely
point
out
that
it
is
a
valid
strategy
which
is
used
every

furthermore
we
dont
know
of
any
substitute
strategy
capable
of
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and

do
you
suggest
it
is
not
a
method
to
apprehend
criminals
that
the

always
knock
with
guns
holstered
and
never
arrest
any
suspects
until
they
have
been
allowed
to
inspect
the
officerss
badges
just
what
should
the
police
do
when
apprehending
potentially
dangerous

how
far
can
they
reasonably
go
to
identity
themselves
what
do
you
suggest
they
can
do
which
cant
be

by
the
competition
it
is
a
very
dangerous
method
to
obtain
evidence
that
might
be
destroyed
if
a
warrant
is
served
in
the
normal
way
it
is
the
most
dangerous
way
to
arrest
anyone
the
cops
are
charging
into
a
room
and
they
dont
know
what
is
in
it
it
is
much
safer
to
surround
the
place
and
announce
yourself
even
if
youve

deadly
enemies
who
may
pretend
to

thats
not

most
drug
dealers

professional
criminals
are
aware
of
the
likelihood
of

but
they
also
know
how
the
system
works
if
they
are

they
call
their
lawyer
post
bail
and
hope
for
a
plea
bargain
if
they
pull
a
gun
and
shoot
a
cop
during
a

they
will
be
charged
with

murder
if
they
survive

guns
for
protection
from
their
customers
and

cops

that

thrash

are
wrong
to
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
god
the
father
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only

son
mcconkie
then
stated
what
mormons
believe
today
to
be
the
truth
about
the
matter
he
said
that
elohim

and

is
the

being
thus
aware
of
how
far
astray
the
religious
intellectualists
have
gone
in
defining
their
threeinone

it
comes
as
no

learn
that
they
thrash

in
the
same
darkness
in
trying
to
identify
elohim

jehovah
and
to
show
their

some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
came
into
mortality
as
the
only
begotten
as
with
their
concept
that
god
is
a
spirit
this
misinformation
about
the
gods
of
heaven
is
untrue
the
fact
is
and
it
too
is
attested
by
holy
writ
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
who
was
born
into

as
the

p
notice

connotes

supremacy
and

doctrine
p
agreeing
with
mcconkie
on
the
question
of
who
elohim

are
the
apostle
james

stated
elohim

p
a

attacked
christians
for
saying
jehovah
can
refer
to

he
stressed
that
these
two
nametitles
should
not

the

is
the
traditional
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
yhwh
or
yhvh
with
the
vowel
points
taken
from
the
word
adonai
many
people
believe
the
true
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
was
yahweh
or
yahveh
however
since
jehovah
rather
than
yahweh
is
the
word
used
by
mormonism
this
section
will
also
use
jehovah
instead
of
yahweh
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
claims
of
mormon
leaders
regarding
that
name
jehovah
unlike
elohim
is
never
used
of
false
gods
it
is
the
personal
name
of
the
triune
god
of
the
bible
in
the
kjv
jehovah
is
rendered
primarily
lord
sometimes
god
and
rarely
lord
now
that
we
understand
something
about
the
words
elohim
and
jehovah
and
their
use
by
mormon
leaders
we
shall
consider
the
apostle
mcconkies
attack
on
christians
for
believing
the
father
is
jehovah
in
trying
to
prove
that
jehovah
refers
exclusively
to
christ
mcconkie
cited
several
verses
from
the
bible
some
of
these
verses
and
mcconkies
interpretation
of
them
will
be
examined
to
see
whether
he
was
right
remember
mcconkie
said
the
father
is
not
jehovah
he
is
only
elohim
the
first
example
we
shall
consider
involves
mcconkies
interpretation
of
ps
of
this
verse
he
stated
of
whom
spake
david
when
his
tongue
was
touched
by
the
holy
spirit
and
he
testified
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
two
lords
are
here
involved
one
is
speaking
to
the
other
one
is
greater
than
the
other
one
is
making
provision
for
the
triumph
and
glory
of
the
other
who
are
they
and
what
message
is
contained
in
this
messianic
prophecy
what
think
ye
of
christ
our
lord
asked
certain
of
his
detractors
toward
the
end
of
his
mortal
ministry
whose
son
is
he
is
christ
the
son
of
god
or
of
someone
else
is
he
to
be
born
of
a
divine
parent
or
will
he
be
as
other
men
a
mortal
son
of
a
mortal
father
that
he
was
to
be
a
descendant
of
david
was
a
matter
of
great
pride
to
all
the
jews
and
so
they
answered
the
son
of
david
davids
son
truly
he
was
but
he
was
more
much
more
and
so
our
lord
with
irrefutable
logic
and
to
their
complete
discomfiture
asked
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
lord
saying
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
if
david
then
call
him
lord
how
is
he
his
son
that
is
if
he
is
only
the
son
of
david
how
is
it
that
the
great
king
acting
under
inspiration
calls
him
lord
and
worships
him
as
such
and
we
might
add
who
is
the
other
lord
the
one
who
spake
unto
davids
lord
can
there
be
any
question
as
to
how
jesus
is
interpreting
the
words
of
the
psalm
he
is
saying
that
it
means
the
father
said
unto
the
son
elohim
said
unto
jehovah
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
until
after
your
mortal
ministry
then
i
will
raise
you
up
to
eternal
glory
and
exaltation
with
me
where
you
will
continue
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
forever
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
agreeing
with
the
above
statement
by
mcconkie
the
following
remark
in
the
mormon
pamphlet
what
the
mormons
think
of
christ
p
reads
the
lord
elohim
the
father
said
unto
my
lord
jehovah
the
son
brackets
in
original
mcconkie
clearly
stated
that
it
is
elohim
the
father
who
is
speaking
to
jehovah
the
son
in
this
psalm
however
when
one
looks
at
the
hebrew
word
translated
lord
it
becomes
apparent
that
either
the
first
lord
is
not
the
father
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
either
way
mcconkie
is
wrong
the
psalm
reads
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
my
lord
adon
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
the
first
lord
in
this
verse
is
jehovah
who
mormonism
says
is
christ
not
the
father
the
second
lord
is
the
hebrew
word
adon
singular
for
adonai
meaning
master
or
lord
if
the
first
lord
is
the
father
and
the
second
lord
is
the
son
then
the
father
is
jehovah
and
the
son
is
adon
however
if
the
father
is
not
jehovah
as
mcconkie
claimed
then
the
first
lord
is
jehovah
the
son
but
who
then
is
adon
obviously
the
father
is
jehovah
in
this
psalm
and
his
son
is
adon
another
example
involves
isa
about
which
mcconkie
stated
the
following
i
the
lord
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
isaiah
quoted
the
father
as
saying
of
christ
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
said
the
father
was
speaking
of
christ
in
this
passage
which
reads
i
the
lord
jehovah
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
according
to
mcconkie
i
the
lord
refers
to
the
father
and
thine
and
thee
refer
to
christ
however
the
lord
who
is
speaking
is
jehovah
which
means
either
mcconkie
was
wrong
about
who
is
speaking
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
another
example
involves
ps
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
same
psalm
says
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out
the
lip
they
shake
the
head
saying
he
trusted
on
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
let
him
deliver
him
seeing
he
delighted
in
him
ps
the
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
is
found
in
these
words
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
he
saved
others
himself
he
cannot
save
if
he
be
the
king
of
israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
him
he
trusted
in
god
let
him
deliver
him
now
if
he
will
have
him
for
he
said
i
am
the
son
of
god
the
thieves
also
which
were
crucified
with
him
cast
the
same
in
his
teeth
matt
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
ps
reads
as
follows
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out

saying
he

jehovah

deliver
him
seeing

him
mcconkie
said
these
verses
had
their
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
that
means
the
person
who
was
scorned
in
these
verses
was
christ
who
then
was
the
lord
in
whom
he
trusted
it
was
jehovah
the
father
another
example
involves
ps
and
ps
regarding
them
mcconkie
stated
the
following
with
reference
to
the
conniving
and
conspiring
plots
incident
to
our
lords
arrest
and
judicial
trials
the
prophecy
was
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
ps
as
to
the
role
of
judas
in
those
conspiracies
the
psalmist
says
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
ps
promised
messiah
p
apostle
mcconkie
said
these
psalms
refer
to
christs
arrest
and
judicial
trials
we
shall
first
consider
ps
and
then
ps
while
mcconkie
only
quoted
verse
of
ps
verse
will
also
be
included
to
give
a
complete
understanding
of
the
matter
for
i
have
heard
the
slander
of
many
fear
was
on
every
side
while
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
but
i
trusted
in
thee
o
lord
jehovah
i
said
thou
art
my
god
elohim
ps
mcconkie
said
verse
referred
to
jesus
christ
verse
goes
on
to
tell
that
he
christ
trusted
in
the
lord
who
is
called
his
god
or
elohim
mormonism
teaches
that
the
god
above
jesus
is
elohim
the
father
verse
however
reveals
that
the
elohim
of
the
man
jesus
is
jehovah
the
father
in
ps
mcconkie
only
quoted
one
verse
however
two
verses
will
be
considered
in
this
examination
yea
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
but
thou
o
lord
jehovah
be
merciful
unto
me
and
raise
me
up
that
i
may
requite
them
ps
mcconkie
stated
above
that
verse
referred
to
judas
role
in
christs
death
since
it
was
judas
who
was
the
familiar
friend
who
lifted
up
his
heel
the
pronouns
mine
i
my
and
me
in
verse
must
refer
to
christ
notice
that
at
the
beginning
of
verse
there
is
a
change
of
pronoun
to
thou
which
refers
to
the
lord
jehovah
then
the
pronouns
me
and
i
which
refer
to
christ
are
used
again
that
means
christ
was
speaking
to
jehovah
the
father
in
these
verses
another
example
involves
mcconkies
following
remark
about
ps
one
of
the
great
messianic
prophecies
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
david
says
the
lord
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
admitted
this
is
a
messianic
prophecy
involving
christ
the
question
is
what
in
this
verse
refers
to
christ
the
lord
jehovah
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
does
the
lord
which
is
jehovah
refer
to
christ
if
mcconkie
is
right
and
jesus
is
jehovah
but
the
father
is
not
then
the
lord
would
have
to
refer
to
christ
but
who
then
is
the
one
addressed
as
the
priest
forever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
the
bible
reveals
that
the
one
referred
to
is
jesus
christ
heb
therefore
the
lord
jehovah
in
ps
is
the
father
another
example
involves
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
of
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
isaiah
said
the
lord
has
laid
on
him
the
iniquities
of
us
all
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
rightly
said
these
verses
refer
to
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
however
what
he
failed
to
mention
is
that
they
also
prove
that
the
father
is
jehovah
verse
reads
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
jehovah
hath
laid
on
him
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
verse
reads
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
jehovah
to
bruise
him
christ
obviously
the
lord
who
laid
on
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
who
bruised
him
is
god
the
father
who
is
called
jehovah
in
these
verses
remember
mcconkie
stated
that
some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only
begotten
son
he
called
this
concept
misinformation
that
is
untrue
to
prove
that
it
is
mcconkie
who
is
misinformed
and
believing
untruth
two
scriptural
references
sam
ps
will
be
examined
mcconkie
stated
the
following
regarding
these
scriptures
in
the
midst
of
a
passage
that
is
clearly
messianic
the
lord
says
of
the
seed
of
david
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
sam
in
the
second
psalm
the
whole
of
which
is
also
clearly
messianic
occurs
this
statement
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ps
paul
quotes
both
of
these
statements
in
hebrews
and
says
they
are
prophecies
that
christ
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
cited
heb
to
show
that
sam
and
ps
refer
to
christ
who
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
since
mcconkie
first
referenced
sam
this
examination
will
too
however
along
with
verse
verses
will
also
be
included
and
as
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
israel
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
also
the
lord
jehovah
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
house
and
when
thy
days
be
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
i
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
thee
which
shall
proceed
out
of
thy
bowels
and
i
will
establish
his
kingdom
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
i
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
ever
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
sam
these
verses
teach
that
the
lord
jehovah
would
have
a
son
the
messiah
in
the
second
example
mcconkie
cited
ps
this
examination
will
include
verse
notice
that
it
is
the
lord
jehovah
who
says
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
jehovah
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ask
of
me
and
i
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession
mcconkie
said
these
verses
of
scripture
are
clearly
messianic
and
he
acknowledged
they
teach
that
christ
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
what
he
is
not
willing
to
acknowledge
however
is
that
these
scriptures
also
teach
that
the
father
is
jehovah
and
that
the
sectarians
who
believe
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
is
jesus
christ
the
only
begotten
are
right
in
their
belief
another
example
involves
mic
of
this
verse
mcconkie
stated
the
following
and
so
truly
did
our
lord
act
during
his
mortal
ministry
truly
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
he
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
mic
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
according
to
mcconkie
the
pronoun
he
at
the
beginning
of
mic
refers
to
christ
during
his
mortal
ministry
who
then
is
the
lord
his
god
mic
reads
and
he
christ
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
jehovah
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
jehovah
his
god
elohim
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
obviously
the
lord
of
jesus
christ
is
jehovah
the
father
who
is
referred
to
as
jehovah
his
elohim
another
example
involves
ps
and
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
following
a
number
of
messianic
passages
speak
of
the
lord
andhis
anointed
ps
signifying
that
the
chosen
one
was
consecrated
and
set
apart
for
the
ministry
and
mission
that
was
his
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
by
quoting
isaiahs
prophecy
the
lord
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
isa
and
then
saying
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
luke
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
the
first
source
mcconkie
quoted
ps
reads
as
follows
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
jehovah
and
against
his
anointed
mcconkie
said
the
anointed
one
was
christ
if
that
is
true
who
was
jehovah
if
jehovah
is
always
christ
who
was
the
anointed
one
obviously
jehovah
is
referring
to
god
the
father
and
the
anointed
is
indeed
referring
to
christ
the
second
source
mcconkie
cited
is
isa
which
states
the
spirit
of
the
lord
adonai
god
jehovah
is
upon
me
because
the
lord
jehovah
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
he
hath
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
brokenhearted
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
the
one
who
was
anointed
to
preach
bind
up
proclaim
and
open
was
jesus
christ
who
then
was
the
one
who
anointed
him
this
verse
says
the
lord
jehovah
did
the
anointing
again
we
face
the
same
problem
if
jehovah
does
not
refer
to
the
father
but
only
to
christ
then
jesus
anointed
someone
but
who
as
mcconkie
pointed
out
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
therefore
the
jehovah
who
anointed
christ
is
god
the
father
other
examples
could
be
cited
to
show
that
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
are
wrong
when
they
say
god
the
father
is
not
jehovah
however
these
should
be
enough
to
expose
their
error
now
what
about
mormonisms
claim
that
jesus
is
jehovah
but
he
is
not
elohim
it
is
true
that
jesus
is
jehovah
the
following
scriptures
prove
this
fact

that
the
lord
jehovah
is
greater
than
all
gods
elohim
exod
see
also
ps
deut
if
mormon
leaders
are
right
when
they
say
jehovah
is
god
the
son
and
elohim
is
god
the
father
these
verses
from
the
bible
would
be
teaching
that
the
mormon
son
is
above
his
father
however
as
mcconkie
clearly
stated
mormons
believe
elohim
the
father
not
jehovah
the
son
is
the
god
above
all
gods
that
jesus
is
above
all
except
the
father
yet
the
bible
teaches
that
jehovah
is
above
all
elohim
at
a
byu
dev
on
march
bruce
r
mcconkie
made
the
following
remark
about
praying
to
jesus
another
peril
is
that
those
so
involved
often
begin
to
pray
directly
to
christ
because
of
some
special
friendship
they
feel
has
been
developed
this
is
plain
sectarian
nonsense
our
prayers
are
addressed
to
the
father
and
to
him
only
perfect
prayer
is
addressed
to
the
father
in
the
name
of
the
son
it
is
uttered
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
our
relationship
with
the
lord
pp
mcconkie
states
on
p
of
his
book
promised
messiah
that
the
mormons
pray
to
the
father
not
the
son
on
p
of
the
same
book
mcconkie
states
that
christ
the
son
is
jehovah
this
is
important
to
remember
because
although
mcconkie
said
prayer
is
not
to
be
offered
to
the
mormon
christ
who
is
jehovah
the
bible
states
repeatedly
in
the
ot
that
people
prayed
to
jehovah
and
he
not
only
heard
those
prayers
but
he
accepted
them
as
valid
requests
the
following
is
but
a
small
sample
of
the
vast
number
of
times
people
prayed
to
jehovah
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
jehovah
and
cried
unto
my
god
elohim
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
came
before
him
even
into
his
ears
ps
and
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
kin
and
said
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
let
we
beseech
thee
our
supplication
be
accepted
before
thee
and
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
even
for
all
this
remnant
jer
o
lord
jehovah
i
beseech
thee
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name
neh
and
it
was
so
that
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
all
this
prayer
and
supplication
unto
the
lord
jehovah
he
arose
from
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
jehovah
from
kneeling
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
spread
up
to
heaven
kin
he
went
in
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
jehovah
kin
go
and
say
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
the
god
elohim
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
add
unto
thy
days
fifteen
years
isa
i
acknowledge
my
sin
unto
thee
and
mine
iniquity
have
i
not
hid
i
said
i
will
confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
jehovah
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
sin
for
this
shall
every
one
that
is
godly
pray
unto
thee
in
a
time
when
thou
mayest
be
found
ps
notice
above
in
ps
that
the
godly
pray
to
jehovah
according
to
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
that
is
christ
the
very
one
to
whom
mcconkie
said
people
should
not
pray
the
bible
reveals
there
is
only
one
true
elohim
and
his
name
is
jehovah
all
other
elohim
are
false
they
are
idols
that
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
the
true
elohim
and
idolatry
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
great
and
greatly
to
be
praised
he
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods
elohim
for
all
the
gods
elohim
of
the
nations
are
idols
but
the
lord
jehovah
made
the
heavens
ps
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
elohim
before
me
exod
now
i
know
that
the
lord
jehovah
is
greater
than
all
gods
elohim
exod
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
and
walk
after
other
gods
elohim
and
serve
them
and
worship
them
i
testify
against
you
this
day
that
ye
shall
surely
perish
deut
thou
shalt
make
no
covenant
with
them
nor
with
their
gods
elohim
they
shall
not
dwell
in

land
lest
they
make
thee
sin
against
me
for
if
thou
serve
their
gods
elohim
it
will
surely
be
a
snare
unto
thee
exod
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived
and
ye
turn
aside
and
serve
other
gods
elohim
and
worship
them
deut
that
ye
come
not
among
these
nations
these
that
remain
among
you
neither
make
mention
of
the
name
of
their
gods
elohim
nor
cause
to
swear
by
them
neither
serve
them
nor
bow
yourselves
unto
them
josh
neither
walk
after
other
gods
elohim
to
your
hurt
jer
but
the
lord
jehovah
is
the
true
god
elohim
he
is
the
living
god
elohim
jer
and
they
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
god
elohim
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
elohim
of
the
gods
elohim
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
and
provoked
the
lord
jehovah
to
anger
jud
shall
a
man
make
gods
elohim
unto
himself
and
they
are
no
gods
elohim
therefore
behold
i
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know
i
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand
and
my
might
and
they
shall
know
that
my
name
is
the
lord
jehovah
jer
and
if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the
lord
jehovah
choose
you
this
day
whom
ye
will
serve
whether
the
gods
elohim
which
your
fathers
served
that
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
flood
or
the
gods
elohim
of
the
amorites
in
whose
land
ye
dwell
but
as
for
me
and
my
house
we
will
serve
the
lord
jehovah
and
the
people
answered
and
said
god
elohim
forbid
that
we
should
forsake
the
lord
jehovah
to
serve
other
gods
elohim
josh
these
verses
teach
that
the
only
true
living
elohim
in
heaven
and
on
earth
is
jehovah
the
triune
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
and
all
therein
jehovah
is
greater
than
any
elohim
because
all
other
elohim
are
idols
the
reality
behind
them
is
demonic
deut
jehovah
elohim
has
given
explicit
warnings
and
guidelines
regarding
these
false
elohim
he
told
his
people
not
to
have
any
elohim
but
him
he
told
the
people
that
if
they
left
him
for
the
false
elohim
those
elohim
would
be
a
snare
to
them
and
they
would
be
hurt
and
would
perish
he
warned
the
people
to
take
heed
that
their
heart
be
not
deceived
into
worshiping
serving
swearing
by
and
making
covenants
with
false
elohim
jehovah
elohim
told
his
people
he
would
eventually
judge
all
false
elohim
and
their
followers
despite
these
warnings
and
guidelines
elohims
covenant
people
forsook
him
and
believed
in
and
worshiped
the
false
elohims
of
the
people
they
came
in
contact
with
ju
states
that
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
the
gods
elohim
of
syria
and
the
gods
elohim
of
zidon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
moab
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
philistines
and
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
not
him
this
examination
has
shown
that
the
elohim
of
mormonism
like
the
elohim
in
ju
is
not
the
true
jehovah
elohim
therefore
the
people
who
leave
the
true
elohim
for
the
mormon
elohim
will
do
evilin
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
although
mcconkie
attacked
christians
for
their
belief
in
a
triune
god
who
is
spirit
and
for
their
belief
that
god
the
father
jehovah
sent
his
son
into
the
world
these
beliefs
are
true
god
is
triune
he
is
spirit
he
is
jehovah
and
he
did
send
his
son
into
the
world
to
redeem
mankind
it
is
obvious
from
this
examination
that
it
is
not
the
christians
who
thrash
around
indarkness
about
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
one
wonders
what
holy
writ
mcconkie
had
in
mind
when
he
stated
that
it
attests
to
the
fact
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
he
certainly
did
not
mean
the
bible
which
teaches
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
are
all
the
one
jehovah
elohim
he
apparently
did
not
mean
the
dc
either
because
chapter
verses
refer
to
the
father
as
jehovah
summary
obviously
joseph
fielding
smiths
statement
that
the
mormons
have
a
clear
and
perfect
understanding
of
the
nature
of
god
doctrines
of
salvation
is
not
accurate
the
mormon
gods
are
not
the
true
god
as
mormonism
claims
but
are
idols
which
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
in
answer
to
jesus
question
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
mormons
say
jesus
is
someone
different
from
the
jesus
who
is
revealed
in
the
bible
and
whom
the
apostles
preached
therefore
anyone
trusting
in
the
mormon
jesus
is
believing
in
another
jesus
whom
paul
warned
about
bernard
p
brockbank
of
the
first
quorum
of
the
seventy
admitted
in
the
may
issue
of
the
ensign
a
mormon
publication
that
the
mormon
jesus
is
different
from
the
christian
jesus
he
stated
that
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
christian
churches
worship
a
different
jesus
christ
than
is
worshipped
by
the
mormons
or
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
p
the
people
who
believe
in
the
mormon
jesus
are
committing
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
they
do
not
have
the
son
therefore
they
do
not
have
the
father
and
they
do
not
have
eternal
life
as
the
apostle
bruce
r
mcconkie
rightly
stated
salvation
comes
only
by
worshiping
the
true
god
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
also
rightly
stated
that
the
mere
worship
of
a
god
who
has
the
proper
scriptural
names
does
not
assure
one
that
he
is
worshiping
the
true
and
living
god
because
the
true
names
of
deity
can
be
applied
to
false
concepts
of
god
mormon
doctrine
p
remember
that
the
apostle
stephen
l
richards
admitted
that
joseph
smith
jr
gave
a
new
conception
of
god
and
the
godhead
contributions
of
joseph
smith
p
it
is
important
for
the
people
who
have
left
the
true
triune
god
revealed
in
the
bible
to
repent
and
return
to
him
they
must
forsake
the
sins
of
idolatry
and
adultery
which
they
are
committing
in
mormonism
the
bible
says
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth
because
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
jehovah
the
fountain
of
living
waters
jer
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
and
walk
after
other
gods
elohim
and
serve
them
and

them
i

does

i

i

that
you

if
you
say

and
give
it
the
authority
of

i
will
respond
by
asking
you
why
you
arent

say
anything

if
your
intent
is
to
convince
me
that
x

then
yes
the

if
what

could

disproven
by

observation
then
i
would
agree
with
you
chris
the
burden
of
proof
would
belong
to
bill
but
the
source
document
for
christianity
the
bible
simply
assumes
god
exists
and
makes
it
clear
to
us
calvinists
anyway
that
when
a
person
is
in
fellowship
with
god
it
is
because
god
has
taken
the
initiative
in
revealing
himself
to
that
person
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
the
burden
of
proof
belongs
to
god
bill
is
being
consistent
with
what
the
bible
teaches
in
relating
his
own
experience
with
god
but
it
would
be
an
error
on
his
part
to
assume
that
there
is
a
direct
causal
relationship
between
his
testimony
and
someone
else
becoming
convinced
that
god
exists
and
that
he
needs
to
be
reconciled
to
god
if
you
are
merely
giving
testimony
to
your
beliefs
then
you
are
an
egotist
please
excuse
me
if
i
missed
an
earlier
part
of

what
right

god
have
on
our

always
assuming
there
is

god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according

his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a

creates
a
unique

creature
which
has
happened
it
was

patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its

on
us
who
can
tell

righteous

when

what

now
did
jesus
change
that
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
sure
he
does
this
however
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stoning
nonvirgin
brides
because
this
needs
no
clarification
are
you
going
to
deny
that
deuteronomy
is
not
patently
clear
in
its
intent
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at
or
at
least
i
think
i
do
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken
but
i
think
you
are
asking
me
if
i
still
believe
that
we
should
uphold
all
of
the
laws
pertaining
to
capital
punishment
for
such
things
as
adultery
rape
and
other
heinous
crimes
as
you
may
recall
jesus
was
confronted
by
this
same
question
in
regards
to
the
adultress
who
was
caught
in
the
act
and
brought
before
jesus
and
his
reply
let
he
who
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
jesus
does
not
deny
the
sentence
that
is
to
due
for
this
violation
of
the
law
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
ill
agree
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharisees
that
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believe
in
it
depending
on
how
they
use
this
knowledge
they
can
be
scary
they
can
argue
any
position
they
desire
and
back
it
up
with
selected
parts
of
the
bible
such
pharisees
include
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualify
this
by
saying
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
believed
what
they
were
preaching
but
the
ends
certainly
made
the
means
look
frightening
agreed
however
just
as
scary
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bible
but
believe
every
word
in
fact
this
is
probably
scarier
since
there
are
far
more
of
these
people
from
what
ive
seen
in
addition
they
are
very
easy
to
manipulate
by
the
aforementioned
pharisees
since
they
dont
know
enough
to
debate
with
these
people
agreed
also
if
one
is
to
use
the
bible
as
a
reference
one
must
always
be
open
to
different
interpretations
as
a
christian
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
to
verify
what
i
believe
in
the
word
if
what
the
spirit
tells
me
is
not
backed
up
in
scripture
then
the
spirit
i
am
communicating
with
is
not
of
god
after
all
jesus
tells
us
to
test
the
spirits
to
know
for
sure
that
it
is
from
god
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
no
it
demands
obedience
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
personally
told
me
how
i
should
behave
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
doing
gods
will
by
doing
it
however
if
preachers
pastors
and
evangelists
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
people
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everything
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarcely
be
honest
with
myself
by
saying
im
doing
the
will
of
god
i
obey
what
the
spirit
of
god
tells
me
to
do
the
spirit
will
not
violate
anything
that
is
written
in
the
bible
because
that
is
the
word
of
god
i
do
not
worship
pastors
preachers
my
wife
my
mother
or
my
father
what
they
tell
me
does
not
carry
the
weight
of
what
god
tells
me
to
do
and
his
commands
are
rienforced
in
the
bible
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
well
if
god
respects
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bible
about
eternal
damnation
for
nonbelievers
i
see
little
respect
eminating
from
the
god
of
the
bible
i
see
a
selfish
and
spiteful
god
eternal
damnation
is
the
consequence
of
the
choice
one
makes
in
rejecting
god
if
you
choose
to
jump
off
a
cliff
you
can
hardly
blame
god
for
you
going
splat
at
the
bottom
he
knows
that
if
you
choose
to
jump
that
you
will
die
but
he
will
not
prevent
you
from
making
that
choice
in
fact
he
sent
his
son
to
stand
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
tell
everyone
of
what
lies
below
to
prove
that
point
jesus
took
that
plunge
himself
but
he
being
god
was
able
to
rise
up
again
i
have
seen
the
example
of
christ
and
have
chosen
not
to
jump
and
im
trying
to
tell
you
not
to
jump
or
else
youll
go
splat
you
dont
have
to
listen
to
me
and
i
wont
stop
you
if
you
decide
to
jump
i
only
ask
that
you
check
it
out
before
taking
the
plunge
you
owe
it
to
yourself

the

this
sounds
interesting
but
what
exactly
do
you
mean
well
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
read
the
book
parallel
universes
by
dr
fred
wolf
in
essence
dr
wolf
says
that
one
interpretation
of
the
subatomic
particlewave
duality
is
that
what
we
perceive
as
a
wave
is
actually
an
infinate
number
of
parallel
universes
overlaid
and
in
each
of
these
universes
there
is
a
particle
in
a
different
location
when
we
do
something
to
make
a
particle
appear
we
are
actually
causing
all
the
parallel
universes
to
collapse
into
one
apparently
this
is
one
line
of
thought
on
the
nature
of
qm
that
is
going
through
some
of
the
scientific
community
dr
wolf
and
many
others
claim
that
somehow
the
collapse
is
caused
by
the
mental
effort
of
observing
the
particle
this
implys
that
mind
is
more
than
merely
a
biological
phenomenon
he
then
extrapolates
that
if
mind
is
an
integral
part
of
the
universe
then
perhaps
consciousness
is
the
element
that
gives
order
and
form
to
the
universes
itthemselfs
it
all
gets
rather
interesting
but
what
i
find
facinating
is
that
this
would
explain
the
phenomenon
of
magick
as
practiced
in
my
religion
dr
wolf
speculates
that
the
ordering
functionality
of
mind
could
be
caused
by
the
selection
of
a
future
from
an
infinite
number
of
possible
futures
he
says
that
this
might
be
done
by
some
sort
of
communication
between
ones
current
and
possible
future
selves
i
have
long
speculated
that
if
magick
is
not
merely
a
form
of
self
delusion
then
perhaps
it
could
be
caused
by
some
sort
of
a
selection
of
one
of
many
possible
futures
i
realize
that
this
gets
pretty
bizarre
but
it
never
hurts
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
at
least
file
it
all
away
as
another
possibile
explaination
of
the
world
in
which
we
find
ourselves
after
all
the
more
we
learn
about
the
universe
in
which
we
live
the
more
we
learn
that

its

to
a
wise

ez
the

chronological
scheme
as
well
as
internal

balances
daniel

chiliastically

suggest
an
attempt
at
redactional
unity
after
the
prefatory
tale
emphasizing
the
life
in
court
and
the
loyalty
of
daniel
and
some
youths
to
their
ancestral
religion
a
chronological
ordering
is
discernable
a
sequence
from
king
nebuchadrezzar
to
darius
is
reported
dn
much
of
this
royal
dating
and
even
some
of
the
tales
are
problematic
for
example
daniel
speaks
of
nebuchadrezzars
transformation
into
a
beast
a
story
that
is
reported
in
the
qumran
scrolls
of
nabonidus
belshazzar
is
portrayed
as
the
last
king
of
babylon
although
he
was
never
king
and
darius
is
called
a
mede
who
conquered
babylon
and
is
placed
before
cyrus
ii
of
persia
although
no
such
darius
is
known
the
medes
followed
the
persians
and
darius
is
the
name
of
several
persian
kings
presumably
the
episodes
of
daniel
depicting
a
series
of
monarchical
reversals
episodes
of
ritual
observances
and
reports
of
miraculous
deliverances
were
collected
in
the
seleucid
period
late
fourth
to
midsecond
century
bce
in
order
to
reinvigorate
waning
jewish
hopes
in
divine
providence
and
encourage
steadfast
faith
the
visions
of
daniel
reporting
events
from
the
reign
of
belshazzar
to
that
of
cyrus
ii
but
actually
predicting
the
overthrow
of
seleucid
rule
in
palestine
were
collected
and
published
during
the
reign
of
antiochus
iv
prior
to
the
maccabean
revolt
for
it
was
then
beginning
in
bce
that
the
jews
were
put
to
the
test
concerning
their
allegiance
to
judaism
and
their
ancestral
traditions
and
many
refused
to
desecrate
the
statues
of
moses
and
endured
a
martyrs
death
for
their
resolute
trust
in
divine
dominion
all
of
the
visions
of
daniel
dramatize
this
dominion
in
different
ways
for
example
via
images
of
the
enthronement
of
a
god
of
judgment
with
a
son
of
man
invested
with
rule
this
figure
was
interpreted
by
jews
as
michael
the
archangel
and
by
christians
as
christ
in
chapter
via
zodiacal
images
of
cosmic
beasts
with
bizarre
manifestations
as
in
chapter
or
via
complex
reinterpretations
of
ancient
prophecies
especially
those
of
jeremiah
as
found
in
daniel
the
imagery
of
the
four
beasts
in
chapter
paralleled
by
the
image
of
four
metals
in
chapter
representing
four
kingdoms
to
be
overthrown
by
a
fifth
monarchy
of
divine
origin
is
one
of
the
enduring
images
of
the
book
it
sur
vived
as
a
prototype
of
jewish
and
christian
historical
and
apocalyptic
schemes
to
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
the
role
and
power
of
this
imagery
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
work
of
the
exegete
isaac
abravanel
the
scientist
isaac
newton
and
the
philosopher
jean
bodin
and
among
the
fifth
monarchy
men
of
seventeenth
century
england
for
example
is
abiding
testimony
to
the
use
of
this
ancient
topos
in
organizing
the
chiliastic
imagination
of
diverse
thinkers
and
groups
the
schema
is
still
used
to
this
day
by
various
groups
predicting
the
apocalyptic
advent
the
encouragement
in
the
face
of
religious
persecution
that
is
found
and
propagandized
in
daniel
contains
a
remarkable
reinterpretation
of
isaiah
regarding
the
suffering
servant
of
god
not
as
all
israel
but
as
the
select
faithful
neither
the
opening
stories
about
daniel
and
the
youths
nor
the
final
martyrological
allusions
advocate
violence
or
revolt
they
rather
advocate
a
stance
of
piety
civil
disobedience
and
trustful
resignation
victory
for
the
faithful
is
in
the
hands
of
the
archangel
michael
and
the
martyrs
will
be
resurrected
and
granted
astral
immortality
persumably
the
circles
behind
the
book
were
not
the
same
as
the
maccabean
fighters
and
may
reflect
some
protopharisaic
group
of
hasidim
or
pietists
the
themes
of
resistance
to
oppression
freedom
of
worship
preservation
of
monotheistic
integrity
the
overthrow
of
historical
dominions
and
the
acknowledgement
of
the
god
of

recur
throughout
the

have
served
as

there
may

we
can

only
that
the
second
half
of
the

means
camel
the
form
zoroaster
derived
from
the
greek
zoroastres
was
used
traditionally
in
european
culture
until
the
eighteenth
century
when
zarathustra
closer
to
the
original
and
as
found
in
nietzsche
came
into
common
use
after
the
rediscovery
of
the
avesta
the
collection
of
sacred
books
of
zoroastrianism
and
the
resulting
studies
in
iranian
philology
see
avesta
notwithstanding
the
great
and
continued
popularity
of
zarathushtra
even
in
western
culture
the
sources
available
to
us
are
few
extremely
fragmented
and
heterogeneous
our
principle
sources
are
the
five
gathas
songs
attributed
to
zarathushtra
himself
and
included
in
the
yasna
section
of
the
avesta
gatha
ahunavaiti
yasna
gatha
ushtavaiti
yasna
gatha
spentamainyu
yasna
gatha
vokukhshathra
yasna
and
gatha
vashishtoishti
yasna
the
last
of
which
was
probably
written
after
the
prophets
death
other
sources
of
considerable
albeit
varying
importance
are
the
younger
avesta
and
the
remaining
zoroastrian
religious
literature
in
particular
the
pahlavi
texts
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centures
ce
although
the
achaemenid
inscriptions
sixth
to
fourth
centures
bce
never
mention
zarathushtra
he
is
mentioned
by
some
greek
sources
of
the
time
not
however
by
herodotus
who
seems
unaware
of
him
the
avesta
does
not
provide
any
direct
or
explicit
data
concerning
the
true
chronological
history
of
zarathushtra
but
the
text
is
useful
in
an
indirect
way
as
it
clearly
implies
that
the
environment
in
which
zoroastrianism
arose
was
not
that
of
iran
under
the
medes
or
the
persians
the
greek
sources
on
the
other
hand
do
provide
some
information
concerning
the
time
of
zarathushtra
although
from
a
historical
point
of
view
they
are
unreliable
some
place
him
six
thousand
years
before
the
trojan
war
xanthus
of
lydia
eudoxus
of
cnidus
hermippus
hermodorus
aristotle
plutarch
diogenes
laertius
and
pliny
the
account
by
xanthus
of
lydia
however
has
also
been
interpreted
by
some
to
mean
six
hundred
rather
than
six
thousand
years
before
the
expedition
of
xerxes
against
greece
this
interpretation
is
favored
by
diogenes
laertius
who
makes
reference
to
xanthus
but
although
a
few
scholars
a
s
shabazi
helmut
humbach
have
recently
attempted
to
rehabilitate
it
under
various
pretexts
it
is
generally
rejected
although
the
historical
value
of
the
greek
sources
is
negligible
they
are
nonetheless
important
in
that
they
show
that
the
millenarian
doctrine
of
history
of
the
cosmos
had
already
been
developed
in
iran
by
the
achaemenid
period
as
the
above
account
would
seem
to
demonstrate
they
also
show
that
by
this
time
zarathushtra
was
already
seen
as
an
almost
mythical
figure
one
from
an
extremely
distant
past
all
of
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prophet
could
not
have
belonged
to
a
historical
period
contemporary
with
or
even
close
to
that
of
the
achaemenids
later
zoroastrian
sources
the
pahlavi
texts
do
provide
an
absolute
chrono
logy
for
zarathushtra
one
that
was
also
accepted
by
some
arab
authors
accord
ing
to
these
sources
zarathushtra
lived
or
years
before
alexander
again
scholars
are
divided
on
the
validity
of
the
chronology
some
view
it
as
historically
reliable
while
others
believe
that
it
is
devoid
of
historical
justification
the
most
convincing
arguments
however
seem
to
support
the
latter
position
the
figure
of
years
is
accurate
only
on
the
surface
because
it
represents
in
fact
the
more
general
one
of
which
was
employed
by
sasanid
propagandists
to
locate
zarathushtras
lifetime
roughly
around
the
beginning
of
iranian
domination
for
a
number
of
reasons
connected
with
complex
problems
inherent
in
the
iranian
chronology
there
was
also
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
sasanid
propagandists
to
avoid
any
millenarian
threat
in
this
context
zarathushtra
whom
tradition
places
early
in
the
ninth
millennium
after
the
beginning
of
the
cosmos
converted
vishtaspa
at
the
age
of
fortytwo
and
vishtaspas
conversion
was
viewed
by
some
as
the
beginning
of
the
millennium
thus
explaining
the
double
date
of
and
years
before
alexander
given
the
unreliability
of
the
few
available
sources
we
are
forced
to
reconstruct
an
absolute
chronology
on
the
basis
of
other
elements
principally
on
the
contention
that
zarathushtra
must
have
lived
a
few
centuries
before
cyrus
the
great
cambyses
and
darius
as
there
is
no
mention
in
the
avesta
of
the
great
political
achievements
that
took
place
in
western
iran
in
the
middle
of
the
first
millennium
bce
nor
is
there
any
mention
of
the
history
of
that
period
which
was
to
lead
iran
to
a
position
of
such
predominance
at
the
same
time
for
a
number
of
reasons
going
back
much
further
in
history
would
not
be
justified
consequently
the
traditionally
accepted
theory
of
placing
zara
thushtra
around
the
beginning
of
the
first
millennium
bce
appears
to
be
the
most
legitimate
as
to
zarathushtras
land
of
origin
many
scholars
agree
on
the
basis
of
valid
arguments
that
he
must
have
come
from
eastern
iran
some
have
held
that
he
was
a
mede
largely
because
of
a
late
iranian
tradition
linking
zarathushtra
with
azerbaijan
but
also
because
of
linguistic
reasons
based
on
the
language
of
the
avesta
this
hypothesis
however
should
be
discarded
as
we
can
suppose
both
on
historical
and
linguistic
grounds
that
zarathushtra
came
from
the
east
even
though
we
do
not
know
precisely
from
which
region
there
is
a
considerable
variety
of
opinion
on
this
particular
matter
including
the
improbable
view
that
he
came
from
chorasmia
or
presentday
khorezm
or
from
a
wider
chorasmian
region
reaching
as
far
as
the
oases
of
merv
and
herat
most
likely
however
zarathushtras
land
of
origin
is
somewhere
in
the
vast
area
stretching
from
the
hindu
kush
mountain
range
to
the
more
southern
regions
of
bactria
and
arachosia
modern
qandahar
as
well
as
drangiana
the
area
of
lake
helmand
it
would
thus
be
located
in
what
is
now
afghanistan
or
in
the
border
regions
of
iran
zarathushtra
himself
tells
us
that
he
belonged
to
the
priestly
caste
yasna
he
was
a
zaotar
cf
sanskrit
hotr
that
is
a
priest
belonging
to
a
specific
group
connected
with
a
school
that
produced
very
elaborate
and
learned
religious
poetry
even
in
the
socalled
younger
avesta
he
is
described
as
an
athravan
yashts
a
more
general
term
encompassing
the
entire
priestly
caste
to
enter
it
he
had
undergone
a
long
and
rigid
training
which
he
used
to
lend
dignity
as
in
the
gathas
to
the
contents
of
his
new
message
the
product
of
a
great
and
original
ethical
mind
zarathushtra
also
belongs
to
that
venerable
priestly
tradition
linking
india
to
iran
in
another
way
by
centering
his
teachings
on
the
praise
of
the
ashavan
or
possessor
of
asha
that
is
the
one
who
as
in
the
vedic
rtavan
seeks
truth
and
masters
it
thus
becoming
ashavan
in
this
life
almost
an
initiate
and
blessed
after
death
any
good
follower
of
such
teachings
seeks
the
vision
of
asha
just
as
those
chosing
the
right
path
in
vedic
india
aspired
to
the
vision
of
the
sun
a
manifestation
of
rta
behind
these
concepts
and
this
language
lies
the
great
tradition
of
aryan
mysticism
that
is
of
indoiranian
mysticism
zarathushtras
greatness
however
does
not
lie
in
his
having
belonged
to
a
particular
religious
tradition
rather
it
lies
in
the
innovation
and
strength
of
his
message
which
was
in
itself
a
break
in
the
tradition
one
that
force
fully
and
effectively
introduced
two
great
revolutionary
ideas
dualistic
monotheism
the
wise
lord
who
fathers
two
twin
spirits
the
beneficent
and
the
evil
and
the
expectation
of
a
transfiguration
av
frashokereti
pahl
frashgird
of
life
and
existence
see
frashokereti
both
his
monotheistic
and
dualistic
ideas
and
his
particular
soteriological
doctrine
deeply
separate
zarathushtras
teachings
from
the
indoiranian
tradi
tions
of
his
upbringing
they
exemplify
his
rebellion
against
a
formalistic
and
ritualistic
religion
that
did
not
provide
adequate
answers
to
the
problem
of
evil
because
of
his
basic
tenets
zarathushtra
who
advocated
an
inward
religiosity
and
the
right
of
the
individual
to
resist
the
imperatives
of
tradi
tion
can
be
numbered
among
the
greatest
of
religious
figures
another
original
facet
of
zarathushtras
message
one
that
is
not
easy
to
understand
but
which
however
holds
the
key
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
complex
intellectual
and
poetic
structure
of
the
gathas
is
the
doctrine
of
the
amesha
spentas
the
beneficent
immortals
these
are
spiritualizations
of
the
abstract
notions
of
good
thought
best
truth
desirable
power
bounteous
devotion
wholeness
and
immortality
all
of
which
operate
according
to
a
system
of
interrelations
and
correlations
and
can
simultaneously
be
the
manifestations
of
a
divinity
and
of
human
virtue

brothers
according
to
tradition
zarathushtra
left
home
at
the
age
of
twenty
and
at
thirty
he
was
subject
to
a
revelation
both
through
an
intense
and
powerful
inspiration
and
through
a
vision
only
after
ten
years
had
passed
however
did
he
succeed
in
converting
a
cousin
of
his
maidhyoimah
to
his
beliefs
he
was
strongly
opposed
in
his
native
land
by
kavis
karapans
and
usijs
priestly
groups
associated
with
traditional
teachings
and
practices
this
hostility
caused
him
to
leave
his
region

and
to
seek
refuge
at
the
court
of
kavi
vishtaspa
a
ruler
who
had
been
converted
to
the
new
religion
together
with
his
wife
hutaosa
when
the
prophet
according
to
tradition
was
fortytwo

who
not

also
predicted

had

praised
often
by

schools
and
who
had
been
seen
by
mani
as

of

three
great
messengers

past

now
seen
instead
as
a

let
us
explore
this
interesting
paragraph
point
by
point
sentence
by
sentence
we
are
talking
about
origins
not
merely
science
origins
of
what
are
we
speaking
of
the
origins
of
life
the
human
species
the
universe
physical
law
biological
diversity
or
what
science
cannot
explain
origins
this
is
a
false
statement
unless
it
is
carefully
qualified
it
depends
on
what
origins
we
are
talking
about
for
a
person
to
exclude
anything
but
science
from
the
issue
of
origins
is
to
say
that
there
is
no
higher
truth
than
science
again
this
is
a
false
statement
to
begin
with
the
notion
of
higher
truth
is
distinctly
dubious
many
people
believe
that
there
are
ways
to
ascertain
truth
that
are
not
in
the
repetoire
of
science
they
even
believe
that
there
are
ways
that
are
more
reliable
and
certain
many
believe
that
there
are
truths
that
cannot
be
expressed
using
the
language
of
science
let
it
be
so
these
truths
are
neither
higher
or
lower
they
are
simply
true
more
to
the
point
restricting
ones
discussion
of
origins
to
science
does
not
reject
other
sources
of
knowledge
it
simply
restricts
the
scope
of
discussion
this
is
a
false
premise
if
this
is
intended
as
asserting
that
the
previous
sentence
was
false
then
is
actually
true
however
the
context
identifies
it
as
another
false
or
at
least
theologically
unsound
statement
by
the
way
i
enjoy
science
on
the
evidence
mr
rawlins
lacks
sufficient
understanding
of
science
to
enjoy
science
in
any
meaningful
sense
one
might
just
as
well
say
that
one
enjoys
literature
written
in
a
language
that
one
cannot
read
however
one
cannot
mark
this
sentence
as
false
to
follow
the
analogy
perhaps
he
likes
the
pretty
shapes
of
the
letters
it
is
truly
a
wonder
observing
gods
creation
let
us
not
quibble
count
this
one
as
true
macroevolution
is
a
mixture
of
percent
science
and
percent
religion
guaranteed
within
three
percent
error
still
another
false
statement
however
one
can
make
it
come
out
true
with
the
following
contextual
modification
macroevolution
as
misunderstood
by
rawline
is
a
mixture
of
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
science
and
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
religion
it
is
distinctly
noticeable
that
mr
rawlins
fails
miserably
to
touch
on
truth
except
when
he
reports
personally
on
what
he
feels
i
do
him
the
justice
of
assuming
that
he
is
not
misinforming
us
as
to
his
personal
reactions
one
can
account
for
this
by
the
hypothesis
that
he
has
an
idiosyncratic
and
personal
concept
of
truth

firstly
science
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
so
you
better
explain
what
objective
atoms
are
and
how
we
get
them
from
subjective
values
before
we
go
any
further
atoms
are
not
objective
they
arent
even
real
what
scientists
call
an
atom
is
nothing
more
than
a
mathematical
model
that
describes
certain
physical
observable
properties
of
our
surroundings
all
of
which
is
subjective
what
is
objective
though
is
the
approach
a
scientist
takes
in
discussing
his
model
and
his
observations
there
is
no
objective
science
but
there
is
an
objective
approach
which
is
subjectively
selected
by
the
scientist
objective
in
this
case
means
a
specified
unchanging
set
of
rules
that
he
and
his
colleagues
use
to
discuss
their
science
this
is
in
contrast
to
your
objective
morality
there
may
be
an
objective
approach
to
subjectively
discuss
your
beliefs
on
morality
but
there
exists
no
objective
morality
also
science
deals
with
how
we
can
discuss
our
observations
of
the
physical
world
around
us
in
that
the
method
of
discussion
is
objective
not
the
science
not
the
discussion
itself
science
makes
no
claims
to
know
the
whys
or
even
the
hows
sometimes
of
what
we
can
observe
it
simply
gives
us
a
way
to
discuss
our

in
a
meaningful
consistent
way

it

his
attempts
to
reconcile
with
mankind
humorous
this
notion
of
an
allknowing
allpowerful
god
who
must
attempt
to
reconcile
with
his
lowly
creations
i
realize
that
it
is
not
possible
to
penetrate
such
logic
but
is
there
any
chance
that
you
might
consider
that
an
omnipotent
god
need
not
attempt
anything
and
further
that
an
attempt
to
reconcile
implies
a
lack
of
omniscience
what
you
are
doing
here
is
projecting
human
weaknesses
onto
your
god
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind
and
loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
sinning
in
the
face
of
god
was
punishable
by
immediate
death
there
are
several
ot
passages
to
back
this
up
god
is
god
but
all
humans
are
sinners
thus
all
prejesus
humans
should
have
been
punished
with
death
we
arent
punished
with
sin
now
of
course
because
god
has
changed
he
required
a
brutal
sadistic
sacrifice
of
his
own
blood
in
order
to
allow
us
to
sin
without
immediate
death
he
cannot
tolerate
the
prescence
of
sin
in
his
midst
yet
he
does
so
now
he
has
changed
the
sadistic
murder
of
his
own
son
has
made
him
more
tolerant
of
our
sins
besides
his
midst
is
everywhere
so
your
statement
is
meaningless
he
tolerates
sin
in
hell
which
surely
is
in
his
midst
as
well
also
given
that
he
is
allknowing
he
must
have
eternal
knowledge
of
who
will
commit
which
sins
as
well
as
when
and
where
so
what
does
tolerance
have
to
do
with
anything
all
of
this
is
absolute
nonsense
unless
your
god
is
not
indeed
allknowing
and
allpowerful
or
unless
he
doesnt
take
the
personal
interest
in
everyday
affairs
that
you
claim
and
the
israelites
knew
this
and
still
some
of
them
chose
to
disobey
and
were
destroyed
were
these
people
kind
and
loving
themselves
not
relevant
the
claim
of
kindness
and
lovingness
was
made
by
you
in
reference
to
your
god
the
nature
of
his
creationsvictims
is
not
at
issue
god
gave
them
every
break
he
could
but
in
the
end
he
really
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
see
an
allknowing
god
who
did
not
know
what
the
ultimate
outcome
would
be
and
an
allpowerful
god
who
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
mindmush
seeing
as
how
we
were
failing
to
achieve
salvation
on
our
own
he
sent
his
son
to
die
for
us
to
be
the
ultimate
sin
offering
did
i
miss
something
did
you
give
some
indication
at
to
why
a
kind
and
loving
god
should
require
sadistic
human
sacrifice
to
allow
his
own
botched
creations
to
achieve
salvation
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
does
this
an
admission
on
his
part
of
having
made
a
mistake
he
sent
his
son
as
a
consolation
to
us
out
of
love
i
note
that
your
answer
physically
follows
my
question
but
i
fail
to
discern
a
connection
between
the
two
by
the
way
for
what
am
i
being
consoled
now
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an
example
of
a
kind
and
loving
god
hey
lets
be
fair
for
a
moment
here
kind
and
loving
does
not
mean
a
free
ride
why
not
by
the
way
i
note
for
the
record
that
you
didnt
answer
the
questions
there
is
an
amount
of
give
and
take
as
in
any
relationship
parents
are
supposed
to
be
kind
and
loving
but
does
that
mean
that
children
can
do
whatever
they
want
not
part
of
being
a
parent
means
administering
punishment
when
the
child
is
at
fault
death
andor
eternal
damnation
is
your
idea
of
correctional
punishment
i
hope
you
arent
a
parent
part
of
being
a
parent
means
giving
instruction
god
tests
us
through
the
trial
of
life
such
that
we
may
grow
stronger
he
teaches
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
this
is
quite
an
elaborate
fantasy
that
youve
constructed
but
sadly
it
lacks
a
basis
in
reality
it
also
does
not
address
the
questions
that
i
raised
the
consequences
of
our
actions
are
made
clear
to
us
be
it
heaven
or
be
it
hell
if
god
did
not
follow
through
with
what
he
has
warned
us
about
he
would
not
be
a
very
good
parent
the
god
that
you
describe
is
not
a
good
parent
but
a
tyrant
in
parenting
if
a
parent
issues
a
warning
but
does
not
follow
through
with
it
the
children
will
not
take
that
parents
words
very
seriously
god
does
the
same
by
telling
us
who
have
ears
to
hear
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
by
lifes
trials
we
see
the
folly
of
doing
our
own
will
rather
than
his
he
warns
us
about
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
when
it
comes
time
for

sorry

how
about

you
take

it
skews

striving

narrow
the

id
guess
that

that

it
might
be
better
to

something
to

which
i

just
for
grins
suppose
we
almost
all

that
we

called

what
then
then
we
all
live
happily
ever

seriously
if
we
all

on
the
circumstances
were

i
suspect
wed
all
agree
on
the
best
course
of
action
unfortunately
i
have
no
confidence
that
such
a
situation
will
ever
arise
some
of
us
think
theres
a
big
god
in
the
sky
some
dont
some
think
theyve
been
chosen
by
god
others
disagree
some
think
they
are
infallible
others
think
otherwise
until
those
disagreements
over
circumstances
can
be
ironed
out
theres
little
hope
of
everyone
agreeing
or
say
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
there
is
no
frame
of
reference
in
which
thus
and
such
is
good
isnt
that
approximately
objective
in
the
same
way
that
we
usually
expect
a
speeding
bullet
to
outrun
a
snail
yes
i
think
that
for
example
only
a
vanishingly
small
number
of
people
would
hold
that
theres
a
frame
of
reference
in
which
gassing
six
million
jews
is
good
so
thats
probably
about
as
close
to
an
objective
moral
value
as
ive
encountered
in
my
life
so
far
for
example
if
we
hear
of
a
bomb
in
a
crowded
area
isnt
it
a
rather
sensible
first
guess
that
this
is
an
immoral
act
even
though
there
conceivably
might
be
some
tailend
case
that
would
justify
it
well
i
think
your
examples
poor
if
the
bombs
in
iraq
for
example
and
was
dropped
by
an
american
plane
many
people
would
hold
that
it
was
a
moral
act
and
what
weasel
word
do
you
use
to
describe
that
frame
of
reference
if
it
isnt
an
objective
reality
for
values
im
sorry
i
cant
parse
an
objective
reality
for
values
could
you
tr
y
again
san
objective
reality
for
valuessome
values
are
real
even
in
the
face
of
disagreement
i
still
dont
quite
see
what
youre
trying
to
say
i
assume
by
values
you
mean
moral
values
yes
in
which
case
what
do
you
mean
by
real
what
is
a
real
moral
value
as
opposed
to
an
unreal
one
i
mean
to
say
that
values
are
as
real
as
horses
whatever
you
understand
by
a
horse
being
real
is
pretty
much
what
i
mean
about
a
value
being
real
hmm
so
these
moral
values
have
a
perceptible
physical
presence
if
you
are
saying
that
some
moral
systems
are
better
than
others
in
your
opinion
then
all
you
get
is
infinite
regress
sorry
but
in
what
way
is
it
an
infinite
regress
it
looks
extremely
finite
to
me
i
meant
that
its
never
more
than
your
opinion
right
and
the
chain
ends
right
there
the

stops

me
its
not
an
infinite
regress
youve
clarified
this
for
me
above
my
understanding
is
now
that
if
a
supermajority
of
relativists
agree
that
thus
and
such
is
wrong
in
almost
any
or
all
frames
of
reference
then
theyre
saying
something
which
is
to
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
no
different
than
what
im
saying
right
the
key
point
however
is
that
there
are
vanishingly
few
of
these
moral
issues
where
we
can
get
of
people
to
agree
on
the
outcome
for
all
frames
of
reference
and
agree
on
the
frames
of
reference
what
you
do
not
get
is
any
justification
for
saying
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
sorry
but
thats
not
so
i
can
provide
a
justification
for
asserting
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
i
just
cant
provide
a
justification
which
works
in
all
possible
circumstances
logically
possible
or
actually
possible
i
cant
manage
either
killing
hitler
using
a
car
bomb
would
have
been
a
terrorist
act
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
couldnt
exactly
condemn
it
although
there
are
tricky
philosophical
issues
to
do
with
hindsight
by
which
i
mean
are
you
stretching
possible
to
include
events
such
as
the
atoms
in
my
terminal
switching
places
so
that
the
terminal
turns
upside
down
or
do
you
think
it
likely
that
circumstances
will
arise
in
which
terrorism
is
superior
to
peace
i
think
that
circumstances
have
already
arisen
where
terrorism
would
have
been
better
than
peace
better
in
terms
of
numbers
of
innocent
people
killed
assuming
it
was
successful
terrorism

sometimes

we

we

if

d
the
idea
of
a

is
meaningless
implying
that
whether
peace

than

eg
is
a
meaningless
question
and
need
not

for
it
has
no

e
something
else
a
short
positive
assertion
would
be
nice
from
whose
point
of
view
would
you
like
to
know
what
relativism
concludes
one
of
the
people
involved
in

or
some
third
person
observing
the

ive
just
come
from
responding
another
of
your
posts
where
some
pennies
have
dropped
for
me
but
it
would
clarify
further
if
you
would
answer
from
the
point
of
view
of
any
disinterested
observers
perhaps
an
observer
as
likely
to
be
in
position
a
as
in
position
b
where
a
and
b
disagree
in
the
future
and
have
his
or
her
conclusion
now
binding
on
them
at
that
time
well
if
our
observer
x
is
as
likely
to
be
in
as
position
as
bs
and
if
he
agrees
that
both
a
and
b
are
making
appropriate
observations
and
inferences
regarding
the
situation
then
i
would
expect
him
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
right
answer
hopefully
there
would
be
some
other
factor
which
would
allow
him
to
make
some
judgement
regarding
which
answer
to
accept
if
on
the
other
hand
he
disagrees
with
the
principles
of
either
a
or
b
i
suspect
he
would
make
a
decision
in
favour
of
the
other
one
it
is
unfortunately
the
case
that
not
all
moral
arguments
have
answers
from
all
perspectives
for
instance
i
am
completely
unable
to
come
to
any
conclusion
regarding
whether
abortion
should
be
allowed
or
not
from
my
perspective
in
an
ideal
world
all
living
things
would
have
a
right
to
life
but
in
an
ideal
world
women
would
have
the
absolute
right
to
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
bodies
clearly
there
is
no
way
to
resolve
in
favour
of
both
these
principles
therefore
i
agree
with
the
compromise
solution
of
allowing
abortion
up
to
a
certain
time
after
conception
and
deciding
on
the
time
based
on
various
sometimes
illdefined
criteria
this
is
also
a
sensible
move
i
think
because
it
lets
people
make
their
own
decisions
within
reason
and
for
what
its
worth
i
am
reasonably
happy
with
current
uk
abortion
law
similarly
the
situation
in
whats
left
of
yugoslavia
is
a
horrible
mess
and
i
really
cant
see
my
way
to
any
sort
of
conclusion
there
i
dont
even
know
enough
to
imagine
what
sort
of
compromise
one
might
manage

i

not

as
the

has
a
wide
variety

uses
if
you

use

those

i

i

with

about
this
if

god

invisible
pink
unicorns
and
go
off

then
as

as
i

i
think
they

i

will
start
by
determining
whether
the

has
evidence
to

actually
i
wasnt

about

about
the
reports
that

with

i
agree
this
is
not

stephen

dear

let
me
begin
by
saying
that
these
are
excellent
questions
but
that
by
asking
you
will
find
as
many
different
explanations
as
there
are
respondents
as
a
latterday
saint
i
believe
that
all
of
us
you
me
etc
lived
once
as
spiritchildren
of
god
the
father
hebrews
in
the
premortal
existance
in
order
to
continue
our
eternal
progression
an
earthly
probationary
time
was
required
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
to
choose
good
over
evil
and
to
prepare
ourselves
in
all
things
to
become
worthy
of
a
higher
order
of
existance
we
believe
that
all
of
gods
spiritoffspring
were
once
assembled
to
discuss
the
specifics
of
this
earthly
sojourn
onethird
chose
for
lucifers
plan
most
followed
the
firstborn
the
premortal
jesus
christ
lucifers
aspirations
i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
isaiah
etc
resulted
into
the
rebellion
of
his
followers
against
the
firstborn
and
those
who
followed
him
resulting
in
the
casting
out
of
lucifer
who
became
satan
the
father
of
lies
and
onethird
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
revelation
as
demons
evil
spirits
to
get
back
on
our
choice
to
be
born
on
this
earth
and
to
be
subject
to
god
and
his
plan
for
good
or
bad
based
upon
our
obedience
and
choices
we
made
that
choice
individually
god
speaking
to
job
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
when
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
job
we
lost
the
knowledge
of
our
premortal
existance
the
veil
of
forgetful
ness
somewhere
in
psalms
in
order
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
you
may
not
accept
this
scenario
neither
do
quite
a
few
who
rely
on
the
bible
alone
which
offers
only
fragmentary
insights
into
this
particular
aspect
of
our
existence
as
individuals
as
sons
and
daughters
of
god
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
all
christians
by
definition
are
a
flock
of
sheep
following
the
shepherd
as
they
understand
him
but
in
any
event
not
all
christians
believe
in
the
same
theology
such
as
the
one
latterday
saints
believe
in
they
will
cry
heresy
and
other
accusations
of
perverting
the
doctrines
of
the
bible
while
they
themselves
believe
in
a
myriad
of
interpretations
as
found
in
their
catechisms
and
various
doityourself
biblestudy
manuals
as
for
me
i
have
a
personal
conviction
that
the
preexistance
scenario
as
explained
above
is
most
in
harmony
with
biblical
doctrine
some
dead
sea
scroll
books
the
pseudographion
other

and
last
but
not

on
the

i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this

not

i
mean
it
how
should
one
deal

a
man
who
is
convinced
that
he
is

will

new
religion
forming
sign
up
let
me
begin
by
saying
i
think
this
is
the
worlds
first
religion
to
use
the
net
as
its
major
recruitment
medium
therefore
even
if
this
religion
does
not
take
off
its
founding
members
will
be
very
important
historically
as
this
method
of
soliciting
membership
will
eventually
become
common
the
basis
of
this
religion
is
to
apply
various
aspects
of
current
conventional
morality
to
the
characters
in
genesis
and
exodus
but
assume
that
the
bibles
accounts
of
the
facts
and
historical
events
is
correct
for
example
story
of
adam
and
eve
adam
and
eve
are
in
garden
of
eden
naked
and
ignorant
have
unlimited
supply
of
food
provided
but
no
clothing
jobs
or
knowledge
god
says
not
to
eat
fruit
of
tree
of
knowledge
they
do
anyway
then
try
to
hide
in
bushes
god
finds
them
and
forces
them
out
of
garden
there
are
several
different
stories
on
what
they
were
doing
while
naked
in
the
bushes
that
might
have
angered
god
traditional
philosophy
the
only
reason
you
need
knowledge
or
a
job
is
to
eat
if
someone
else
will
provide
you
with
food
then
you
can
be
stupid
and
unemployed
and
its
ok
this
is
why
married
women
usually
didnt
work
until
recent
decades
authority
figures
such
as
god
whoever
was
behind
the
vietnam
war
hitler
and
slaveowners
are
always
right
and
should
be
blindly
followed
without
question
by
ordinary
people
who
cant
make
decisions
for
themselves
interpretation
of
events
based
on
traditional
philosophy
they
were
not
supposed
to
eat
the
fruit
they
should
have
done
whatever
god
told
them
to
like
small
children
they
had
their
needs
provided
for
and
were
obligated
to
do
whatever
their
father
said
to
being
forced
to
leave
the
garden
and
work
in
order
to
obtain
food
was
a
punishment
lessons
from
traditional
interpretation
ignorance
is
good
knowledge
is
bad
but
tempting
having
food
provided
for
you
for
nothing
read
welfare
is
ideal
get
ting
a
job
and
feeding
yourself
with
what
you
earn
is
punishment
public
nudity
is
good
covering
up
is
bad
authority
figures
are
intrinsically
right
normal
people
are
dumb
and
should
do
whatever
they
are
told
without
question
they
should
not
think
for
themselves
people
in
subordinate
positions
are
especially
obligated
to
refrain
from
learning
for
example
it
should
be
illegal
for
slaves
to
learn
to
read
philosophy
people
should
seek
education
and
employment
outside
the
home
unless
named
hillary
clinton
or
murphy
brown
people
should
use
common
sense
they
should
not
kill
other
people
binding
of
issac
wars
holocaust
etc
just
because
they
are
told
to
interpretation
of
events
based
on
current
philosophy
they
were
supposed
to
eat
the
fruit
god
gave
wanted
them
to
seek
knowledge
rather
than
be
handed
it
on
a
silver
platter
once
they
had
gained
knowledge
and
by
seeking
it
showed
their
ability
to
make
mature
decisions
for
them
selves
they
no
longer
needed
to
be
treated
like
little
children
and
were
rewarded
by
being
allowed
into
the
real
world
lessons
from
new
interpretation
ignorance
is
bad
knowledge
is
good
but
must
be
sought
having
food
provided
for
you
for
nothing
read
welfare
is
at
best
a
temporary
measure
getting
a
job
and
feeding
yourself
with
what
you
earn
is
ideal
public
nudity
is
bad
covering
up
is
good
authority
figures
are
often
wrong
normal
people
are
intelligent
and
should
consider
whether
the
instructions
are
really
a
good
idea
and
alter
or
abolish
bad
governments
they
should
think
for
themselves
people
in
subordinate
decisions
are
often
discouraged
from
knowledge
but
should
seek
it
anyway
and
all
the
harder
for
example
poor
children
without
good
schools
should
work
especially
hard
in
order
to
make
a
better
life
for
their
children
and
themselves
i
have
tentatively
named
this
new
philosophy
the
church
of
eveism
because
eves
decision
to
eat
the
apple
is
mansickinds
first
good
decision
instead
of
its
first
bad
one
as
traditionally
believed
she
is
therefore
clearly
a
protagonist
god
at
first
appears
evil
for
telling
people
not
to
seek
knowledge
but
on
deeper
analysis
is
also
a
protagonist
as
god
rewarded
the
decision
to
defy
him
and
provided
the
tree
in
the
first
place
the
intention
and
desire
were
clearly
to
have
the
knowledge
be
obtained
but
to
delay
it
until
it
was
actively
sought
end
serious

and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
then
you
lie
to
yourself
you
do
not
know
your
shortcomings
i
have
clearly
shown
one
of
your
shortcomings
if
not
two
that
is
ignorance
of
the
bible
and
the
arrogance
you
demonstrate
butchering
it
without
even
knowing
its
contents
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
because
you
have
been
too
prideful
to
examine
the
record
of
him
for
yourself
and
to
demonstate
your
lack
of
support
for
your
conclusion
i
bet
you
do
not
even
know
what
the
word
christ
means
or
which
prophet
used
christ
to
describe
the
son
of
man
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
yes
i
agree
with
that
so
we
must
learn
first
read
the
bible
come
up
with
our
own
interpretation
evaluate
what
is
being
said
and
by
whom
check
the
history
books
as
well
compare
someone
elses
interpretation
with
your
own
then
make
a
judgment
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
of
what
is
being
said
in
the
bible
needs
interpretation
as
much
as
a
coffee
cup
needs
interpretation
and
remember
the
bible
isnt
a
gurus
esoteric
guide
to
metaphysics
it
doesnt
take
a
theologian
to
understand
what
is
being
said
the
bible
is
a
bunch
of
testimonies
from
people
like
you
and
i
addressed
to
people
like
you
and
i
these
guys
wrote
down
what
they
saw
and
heard
is
it
their
open
diaryand
they
want
to
tell
you
something
and
because
they
want
you
to
know
something
they
make
it
very
clear
what
they
want
you
to
know
they
didnt
encouch
their
ideas
in
esoteric
rhetoric
but
in
simple
straightforward
language
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
the
bible
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
a
confrontation
with
the
living
god
because
that
road
doesnt
look
appealing
to
you
you
rather
build
your
own
road
one
that
goes
far
away
from
that
confrontation
but
be
assured
of
this
you
will
have
to
confront
him
one
day
willingly
or
unwillingly
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
i
see
what
you
mean
i
hear
what
your
saying
i
am
not
degrading
your
life
but
i
have
heard
the
same
irrational
excuses
for
years
there
is
nothing
new
in
what
you
are
saying
and
by
your
own
words
you
are
spouting
off
contradictions
if
contradictions
give
you
meaning
then
your
life
must
be
sad
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
bingo
for
god
so
loved
the
world
he
gave
his
only
begotton
to
son
so
that
whososever
belives
in
him
will
have
ever
lasting
life
i
look
what
god
did
he
has
given
his
son
even
to
his
death
so
that
i
can
have
hope
in
his
resurrection
and
know
that
life
isnt
for
nothing
but
has
glorious
purpose
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
because
you
turn
your
eyes
away
from
testimony
and
history
you
choose
to
lie
to
yourself
that
he
doesnt
exist
for
you
ignore
what
has
been
said
for
thousands
of
years
you
sound
exactly
almost
verbatim
like
the
lazarus
of
jesuss
story
starting
in
luke
and
the
conclusion
of
that
story
is
a
bleak
one
lazarus
wound
up
in
hell
the
story
ends
like
this
for
if
lazarus
doesnt
even
listen
to
moses
and
the
prophets
he
wont
even
believe
if
a
man
rose
from
the
dead
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no
matter
how
powerful
it
is
arrogance
at
its
best
the
fact
is
you
are
not
rational
several
specific
cases
have
already
been
cited
and
again
with
this
new
statement
you
show
more
irrationality
with
regards
to
heaven
jesus
does
tell
you
something
of
what
to
expect
in
heaven
jesus
expects
you
to
use
your
brain
to
believe
in
him
jesus
does
not
expect
you
to
placate
either
jesus
wants
you
to
willingly
come
to
him
but
not
as
his
grovelling
slave
but
rather
as
his
brother
who
will
share
in
his
glorious
riches
why
do
you
not
pick
up
the
bible
and
read
it
for
yourself
you
maintain
you
have
an
open
mind
see
whether
you
are
lying
to
yourself
for
yourself
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstrates
that
you
havent
listened
to
a
single
word
ive
said
i
do
understand
what
you
said
but
thats
is
not
what
i
feel
went
amiss
here
you
missed
the
point
living
a
good
life
has
no
eternal
consequences
once
they
close
the
amusement
park
of
life
to
you
that
is
the
end
to
you
it
is
over
to
you
therefore
your
time
spent
in
the
amusement
park
is
meaningless
it
has
no
eternal
consequences
to
you
nor
to
anyone
left
on
earth
but
then
you
contradict
yourself
from
a
previous
post
you
said
doing
evil
things
is
bad
to
you
it
shouldnt
matter
if
you
do
evil
things
or
good
things
it
is
all
meaningless
in
the
end
anyway
so
go
rob
a
bank
go
tell
someone
you
dislike
that
he
is
a
dirty
rotten
slime
bag
whats
restraining
you
life
after
all
has
no
eternal
consequences
and
accountability
is
irrelevant
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
at
which
time
you
are
truly
not
the
master
of
yourself
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
you
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
what
jesus
says
and
the
witnesses
of
jesus
say
are
true
but
you
choose
to
be
unreasonable
and
ignore
the
reasons
by
definition
ignorance

most
victims

in

during

what
is
needed
is
a
massive
worldwide
program

education
to
teach
all
present
and
potential
perpetrators
in
a
convincing
manner
with
sufficient
supporting
evidence
that
what

do

will
be
done
to
them
in
this

or
the
next
anyone
who
doubts
the
fact
of
reincarnation
and
the
related
law
of
retribution
should
read
books
such
as
here

several
kinds
of
evidence
supporting
reincarnation
including
hypnotic
regression
to
past

about

the
subconscious

sometimes
make
things
up
especially
with
a

matthew

of

how
can
a
person
possibly
sin
before
he
is
born
unless
he
lived
before
strong
interests
innate
talents
strong
phobias
etc
typically
originate
from
a
persons
past
lives
for
example
a
strong
fear
of
swimming
in
or
traveling
over
water
usually
results
from
having
drowned
at
the
end
of
a
previous
life
and
sometimes
a
person
will
take
an
immediate
dislike
to
another
person
being
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
present
life
because
of
a
bad
encounter
with
him
during
a
previous
incarnation
people
would
behave
much
better
toward
each
other
if
they
knew
that
their
actions
in
the
present
will
surely
be
reaped
by
them
in

murmurs
on
subject
re
after
years
can
we
say
that
christian
morality
is
in
my
mind
to
say
that
science
has
its
basis
in
values
is
a
bit
of
a
reach
science
has
its
basis
in
observable
fact
id
say
that
what
one
chooses
to
observe
and
how
the
observation
is
interpreted
and
what
significance
its
given
depends
a
great
deal
on
the
values
of
the
observer
science
is
a
human
activity
and
as
such
is
subject
to
the
same
potential
for
distortion
as
any
other
human
activity
the
myth
that
scientists
are
above
moral
influence
or
ethical
concern
that
their
knowledge
can
be
abstacted
whole
and
pure
from
nature
untainted
by
the
biases
of
the
scientist
is
nonsense
bill
if
one
is
to
argue
for
objective
values
in
a
moral
sense
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstrating
that
morality
itself
is
objective
considering
the
meaning
of
the
word
objective
i
doubt
that
this
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
original
question
and
objective
morality
is
this
may
be
an
unfortunate
choice
of
words
almost
selfcontradictory
objective
in
the
sense
used
here
means
something
immutable
and
absolute
while
morality
describes
the
behavior
of
some
group
of
people
the
first
term
is
all
inclusive
the
second
is
specific
the
concept
supposedly
described
may
have
meaning
however
if
there
is
a
god
as
described
by
the
christians
for
instance
then
he
has
existence
apart
from
and
independent
of
humankind
his
existence
is
outside
of
our
frame
of
reference
reality
if
this
being
declares
a
thing
to
be
so
it
is
necessarily
so
since
he
has
defined
himself
as
omnipotent
and
if
his
claims
are
to
be
believed
he
is
at
least
omnipotent
relative
to
us
god
is
intrinsically
selfdefined
and
all
reality
is
whatever
he
says
it
is
in
an
objective
sense
if
god
determines
a
standard
of
conduct
that
standard
is
objective
if
human
beings
are
held
accountable
for
their
conformance
to
that
standard
while
permitted
to
ignore
it
they
substitute
a
relative
morality
or
mode
of
conduct
giving
the
term
morality
a
nebulous
meaningless
sense
that
can
be
argued
about
by
those
pretending
to
misunderstand
the
standard
is
objective
and
the
conduct
required
to
meet
that
standard
is
therefore
objectively
determined
just
because
it
is
convenient
to
pretend
that
the
term
morality
is
infinitely
malleable
doesnt
mean
that
the
objective
standard
itself
doesnt
exist
morality
has
come
to
mean
little
more
than
a
cultural
norm
or
the
preferred
conduct
of
decent
people
making
it
seem
subjective
but
it
is
derived
from
an
absolute
objective
standard
ironically
this
objective
standard
is
in
perfect
accord
with
our
true
nature
according
to
christianity
at
least
yet
is
condemned
as
being
contrary
to
human
nre
oppressive
and
severe
this
may
be
due
as
bill
much
to
our
amoral
inclinations
as
to
the
standard

the
history
books
look
up
the
primary
sources
yourself
those
of
us
outside
of
germany
do
not
have
access
to
these
you
do
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
plenty
of
documented
instances
several
scandals
the
fact
that
on
the
knight
of
the
long
knives
several
sa
members
including
heines
were
found
sleeping
together
etc
also
i
believe
some
people
were
complaining
about
the
sas
homosexual
activities
seducing
young
boys
etc
the
histories
that
ive
read
make
a
very
convincing
case
none
of
this
sounds
like
urban
legend
to
me
irving
a
notoriously
unreliable
historian
says
that
funk
the
nazi
finance
minister
was
homosexual
he
gives
no
sources
i
know
next
to
nothing
about
irving
and
nothing
about
funk
what
precisely
do
you
know
that
would
contradict
all
of
the
other
history
books
that
i
have
read
concerning
the
existence
of
homosexual
nazis
are
you
trying
to
say
that
all
historians
are
taking
part
in
an
antihomosexual
smear
what
about
homosexual
writers
who
agree
with
the
official
history
dont
you
think
they
would
have
found
out
the
truth
by
now
if
roehm
and
heines
were
not
homosexuals
i
would
think
they
would
want
to
disassociate
homosexuality
from
nazism
no
one
should
use
any
connection
between
the
two
to
bash
homosexuals
in
any
case
i
challenge
anyone
to
document
this
claim
if
you
are
going
to
challenge
all
historians
on
this
point
not
just
irving
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
you
track
down
the
references
find
out
where
the
stories
originate
from
again
you
are
the
one
in
germany
close
to
archival
material
most
people
on
the
net
are
not
i
have
found
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
there
were
many
flaming
heterosexuals
among
the
nazis
this
seems
to
include
all
of
the
worst
oneshitler
himmler
goebbels
goering
heydrich
eichmann
and
many
more
eh
what
is
your
agenda
here
to
prove
that
the
nazis
were
heterosexuals
so
that
you
can
bash
heterosexuals
does
it
bother
you
that
some
of
the
nazis
might
have
been
homosexuals
does
this
make
all
homosexuals
bad
if
this
is
true
of
course
not
and
what
about
bisexuals
are
they
halfnazis
i
dont
know
why
it
would
be
so
difficult
to
believe
that
some
nazis
were
homosexuals
the
german
officer
corps
before
for
instance
was
notorious
for
its
homosexuality
there
were
numerous
scandals
which
rocked
the
german
govt
during
the
late
and
early
century
many
of
the
kaisers
friends
were
prosecuted
the
kaiser
was
no
homosexual
but
the
germany
army
had
a
long
tradition
of
tolerating
homosexuality
going
far
back
into
prussian
history
back
to
frederick
the
great
at
least
who
was
himself
a
homosexual
roehm
was
a
product
of
this
prussian
officer
tradition
and
the
old
german
army
like
the
english
public
school
system
being
a
well
known
center
of
homosexuality
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
overlook
roehms
homosexuality
in
addition
some
nazis
complained
of
homosexuality
in
the
hitler
youth
the
hitler
youth
swallowed
up
all
prenazi
youth
groups
and
some
of
the
various
prewar
vandervogel
bund
and
volkish
youth
groups
were
known
to
promote
homoerotic
ideals
and
friendship
and
in
many
cases
homosexuality
itself
so
it
seems
to
me
not
unlikely
that
there
were
plenty
of
homosexual
nazis
regardless
of
the
official
nazi
dogmas
concerning
the
evils
of
homosexuality
why
should
this
suprise
anyone
homosexuality
has
always
existed
in
all
societies
it
would
be
most
unusual
if
the
nazis
were
an
exception
no
i
dont
have
any
sources
for
you
as
i
think
the
only
kind
of
proof
you
will
accept
would
be
citations
from
archival
material
and
i
do
not
have
access
to
these
nor
do
i
intend
to
reread
every
book
on
the

and
on
modern

that

nothing

since

i
would
ask
how
you
can
thereby
objectively
justify
complete
faith
in
the
words
of
the
books
attributed
to
peter
i
shall
now
give
an
example
of
a
document
from
antiquity
which
i
am
sure
you
reject
it
dates
from
the
time
of
ramses
ii
this
was
first
presented
here
by
matthew
wiener
these
inscriptions
were
carved
soon
after
a
battle
and
were
carved
with
the
pharoahs
specific
approval
so
we
have
true
originals
rather
than
mere
copies
this
account
records
the
the
battle
of
kadesh
circa
bc
which
occurred
on
the
river
orontes
about
miles
south
of
aleppo
the
egyptians
won
this
battle
with
the
hittites
and
ramses
had
his
victory
inscribed
all
over
the
place
a
few
of
of
these
inscriptions
have
survived
in
near
perfect
form
it
is
a
record
of
how
the
pharoah
pretty
much
singlehandedly
defeated
the
hittites
after
being
separated
from
his
troops
note
that
the
egyptian
wavers
back
and
forth
between
first
and
third
person
the
following
is
from
miriam
lichtheims
ancient
egyptian
literature
volume
ii
my
majesty
caused
the
forces
of
the
foes
from
hitti
to
fall
on
their
faces
one
upon
the
other
as
crocodiles
fall
into
the
water
of
the
orontes
i
was
after
them
like
a
griffin
i
attacked
all
the
countries
i
alone
for
my
infantry
and
my
chariotry
had
deserted
me
not
one
of
them
stood
looking
back
as
i
live
as
ra
loves
me
as
my
father
atum
favors
me
everything
that
my
majesty
has
told
i
did
it
in
truth
in
the
presence
of
my
infantry
and
my
chariotry
note
this
paragraph
records
not
only
ramses
divine
word
but
also
that
there
were
thousands
of
witnesses
to
the
event
now
from
the
heart
of
battle
then
his
majesty
drove
at
a
gallop
and
charged
the
forces
of
the
foe
from
hitti
being
alone
by
himself
none
other
with
him
his
majesty
proceeded
to
look
about
him
and
found
chariots
ringing
him
on
his
way
out
no
officer
was
with
me
no
charioteer
no
soldier
of
the
army
no
shieldbearer
my
infantry
my
chariotry
yielded
before
them
not
one
of
them
stood
firm
to
fight
with
them
his
majesty
spoke
what
is
this
father
amun
is
it
right
for
a
father
to
ignore
his
son
are
my
deeds
a
matter
for
you
to
ignore
do
i
not
walk
and
stand
at
your
word
i
have
not
neglected
an
order
you
gave
too
great
is
he
the
great
lord
of
egypt
to
allow
aliens
to
step
on
his
path
what
are
these
asiatics
to
you
o
amun
the
wretches
ignorant
of
god
have
i
not
made
for
you
many
great
monuments
i
call
to
you
my
father
amun
i
am
among
a
host
of
strangers
all
countries
are

against
me
i
am
alone
theres
none
with
me
the
labors
of
many
people
are
nothing
amun
is
more
helpful
than
they
i
came
here
by
the
command
of
your
mouth
o
amun
i
have
not
transgressed
your
command
now
though
i
prayed
in
a
distant
land
my
voice
resounded
in
southern
thebes
i
found
amun
came
when
i
called
to
him
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
i
rejoiced
he
called
from
behind
as
if
near
by
forward
i
am
with
you
i
your
father
my
hand
is
with
you
i
prevail
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
i
am
lord
of
victory
lover
of
valor
i
found
my
heart
stout
my
breast
in
joy
all
i
did
succeeded
i
was
like
mont
i
slaughtered
among
them
at
my
will
not
one
looked
behind
him
not
one
turned
around
whoever
fell
down
did
not
rise
one
called
out
to
the
other
saying
no
man
is
he
who
is
among
us
it
is
seth
greatofstrength
baal
in
person
not
deeds
of
man
are
these
his
doings
they
are
of
one
who
is
unique
who
fights
a
hundred
thousand
without
soldiers
and
chariots
come
quick
flee
before
him
to
seek
life
and
breathe
air
for
he
who
attempts
to
get
close
to
him
his
hands
all
his
limbs
grow
limp
one
cannot
hold
either
bow
or
spears
when
one
sees
him
come
racing
along
my
majesty
hunted
them
like
a
griffin
i
slaughtered
among
them
unceasingly
so
you
see
brian
we
have
a
few
original
manuscripts
recording
the
miraculous
battle
between
the
ramses
and
the
hittites
do
you
reject
them
as
being
completely
true
i
suspect
you
do
and
if
so
then
do
you
also
in
your
own
words
question
the
existence
of
alexander
the
great
tilgrath
pilisar
iii
nero
caligula
josephus
cyrus
the
great
artexerxes
do
you
also
thereby
question
all
their
documents
thats
the
problem
with
your
all
or
nothing
approach
many
ancient
people
used
to
mix
a
bit
of
fancy
with
their
facts
so
for
you
to
say
that
we
must
either
accept
all
of
peter
and
the
rest
of
the
new
testament
or
accept
no
records
of
antiquity
at
all
forces
you
thereby
to
accept
the
verity
of
documents
you
probably
do
not
find
completely
credible
as
to
your
other
argument
that
so
many
people
have
testified
to
jesus
that
he
must
be
true
are
you
going
to
just
pass
off
all
this
testimony
as
fictiousness
are
you
going
to
call
three
thousand
years
worth
of
testimony
from
shepherds
to
irs
agents
to
royal
officials
to
kings
to
computer
programmers
fiction
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complete
ignorance
of
the
testimonies
are
you
going
to
say
that
that
is
all
complete
hooey
would
that
not
be
the
most
audacious
display
of
arrogance
do
you
actually
think
you
know
better
than
king
solomon
king
david
or
even
abraham
lincoln
i
have
three
points
first
this
is
argumentum
ad
populum
ie
appeal
to
popular
opinion
you
cannot
vote
on
truth
for
instance
do
the
millions
of
hindus
past
and
present
who
testify
to
the
reality
of
brahma
constitute
actual
evidence
for
the
existence
of
brahma
how
would
you
answer
your
own
question
in
regards
to
the
testimony
of
hindus
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complete
ignorance
of
the
testimonies
are
you
going
to
say
that
that
is
all
complete
hooey
if
you
do
so
scoff
then
how
do
you
objectively
justify
your
own
special
pleading
second
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
king
solomon
or
king
david
testified
to
jesus
you
can
claim
it
to
be
clear
but
that
does
not
make
it
true
third
it
is
quite
arguable
that
abraham
lincoln
was
not
christian
and
that
he
had
both
a
public
and
a
private
view
of
christianity
in
fact
there
was
much
discussion
about
it
in
his
day
yes
he
was
publically
accused
of
being
a
deist
oh
my
i
am
presently
collecting
a
faq
for
lincoln
as
ive
previously
done
for
tyre
jefferson
and
etc
later
dave
butler
my
earlier
views
of
the
unsoundness
of
the
christian
scheme
of
salvation
and
the
human
origin
of
the
scriptures
have
become
clearer
and
stronger
with
advancing
years
and
i
see
no
reason
for
thinking
i

physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
in
two
reciprocal
forms
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
developed
a
complete
theoretical
universe
using
various
combinations
of
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
vibrational
rotational
motions
the
concepts
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
and
speeds
in
relation
to
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
called
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
at
each
step
in
the
development
larson
was
able
to
match
objects
in
his
theoretical
universe
with
objects
in
the
real
physical
universe
photons

even

not

discovered
then
such
as
exploding
galaxies
and
gammaray
bursts
and
applying
his
theory
to
his
new
model
of
the
atom
larson
was
able
to
precisely
and
accurately
calculate
inter
atomic
distances
in
crystals
and
molecules
compressibility
and
thermal
expansion
of

and
other

of
this
is

physicist
dewey
b
larsons
background
physicist
dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
chemical
or
electrical
he
was
about
years
old
when
he
died
in
may
he
had
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
while
trying
to
develop
a
way
to
compute
chemical
properties
based
only
on
the
elements
used
larsons
lack
of
a
fancy
phd
degree
might
be
one
reason
that
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
him
but
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
sometimes
it
takes
a
relative
outsider
to
clearly
see
the
forest
through
the
trees
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
from
his
books
that
he
also
knew
orthodox
physics
and
astronomy
as
well
as
any
physicist
or
astronomer
well
enough
to
point
out
all
their
contradictions
ad
hoc
assumptions
principles
of
impotence
inconsistencies
etc
larson
did
not
have
the
funds
etc
to
experimentally
test
his
theory
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
he
simply
compared
the
various
parts
of
his
theory
with
other
researchers
experimental
and
observational
data
and
in
many
cases
his
explanation
fit
better
a
selfconsistent
theory
is
much
more
than
the
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
have
they
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
that
works
but
have
been
ignoring
one
for
over
years
now
modern
physics
does
not
explain
the
physical
universe
so
well
some
parts
of
some
of
larsons
books
are
full
of
quotations
of
leading
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
who
agree
and
remember
that
epicycles
crystal
spheres
geocentricity
flat
earth
theory
etc
also
once
seemed
to
explain
it
well
but
were
later
proved
conceptually
wrong

super
collider
boondoggle
i
am
against
contruction
of
the
superconducting
super
collider
in
texas
or
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
gross
waste
of
money
and
contribute
almost
nothing
of
scientific
value
most
physicists
dont
realize
it
but
according
to
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
as
described
in
his
books
the
strange
goofy
particles
mesons
hyperons
alleged
quarks
etc
which
they
are
finding
in
existing
colliders
fermi
lab
cern
etc
are
really
just
atoms
of
antimatter
which
are
created
by
the
highenergy
colliding
beams
and
which
quickly
disintegrate
like
cosmic
rays
because
they
are
incompatible
with
their
environment
a
larger
and
more
expensive
collider
will
only
create
a
few
more
elements
of
antimatter
that
the
physicists
have
not
seen
there
before
and
the
physicists
will
be
even
more
confused
than
they
are
now
are
a
few
more
types
of
antimatter
atoms
worth
the
billion
cost
dont
we
have
much
more
important
uses
for
this
wasted
money
another
thing
to
consider
is
that
the
primary
proposed
location
in
texas
has
a
serious
and
growing
problem
with
some
kind
of
fire
ants
eating
the
insulation
off
underground
cables
how
much
poisoning
of
the
ground
and
ground
water
with
insecticides
will
be
required
to
keep
the
ants
out
of
the
supercollider
naming
the
super
collider
after
ronald
reagon
as
proposed
is
totally
absurd
if
it
is
built
it
should
be
named
after
a
leading
particle
physicist
larsonian
antimatter
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
antimatter
is
not
a
simple
case
of
opposite
charges
of
the
same
types
of
particles
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
rates
of
vibrations
and
rotations
of
the
photons
of
which
they
are
made
in
relation
to
the
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
of
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
calls
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
in
larsons
theory
a
positron
is
actually
a
particle
of
matter
not
antimatter
when
a
positron
and
electron
meet
the
rotational
vibrations
charges
and
rotations
of
their
respective
photons
of
which
they
are
made
neutralize
each
other
in
larsons
theory
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
has
three
dimensions
of
time
and
only
one
dimension
of
space
and
exists
in
a
reciprocal
relationship
to
our
material
half
larsonian
relativity
the
perihelion
point
in
the
orbit
of
the
planet
mercury
has
been
observed
and
precisely
measured
to
advance
at
the
rate
of
seconds
of
arc
per
century
seconds
of
this
advance
are
attributed
via
calculations
to
gravitational
perturbations
from
the
other
planets
venus
earth
jupiter
etc
the
remaining
seconds
of
arc
are
being
used
to
help
prove
einsteins
general
theory
of
relativity
but
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
achieved
results
closer
to
the
seconds
than
general
relativity
can
by
instead
using
special
relativity
in
one
or
more
of
his
books
he
applied
the
lorentz
transformation
on
the
high
orbital
speed
of
mercury
larson
totally
rejected
general
relativity
as
another
mathematical
fantasy
he
also
rejected
most
of
special
relativity
including
the
parts
about
mass
increases
near
the
speed
of
light
and
the
use
of
the
lorentz
transform
on
doppler
shifts
those
quasars
with
redshifts
greater
than
really
are
moving
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
motion
is
away
from
us
in
time
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
there
are
three
dimensions
of
time
instead
of
only
one
but
two
of
those
dimensions
can
not
be
measured
from
our
material
half
of
the
physical
universe
the
one
dimension
that
we
can
measure
is
the
clock
time
at
low
relative
speeds
the
values
of
the
other
two
dimensions
are
negligible
but
at
high
speeds
they
become
significant
and
the
lorentz
transformation
must
be
used
as
a
fudge
factor
larson
often
used
the
term
coordinate
time
when
writing
about
this
in
regard
to
mass
increases
it
has
been
proven
in
atomic
accelerators
that
acceleration
drops
toward
zero
near
the
speed
of
light
but
the
formula
for
acceleration
is
acceleration
force
mass
a
fm
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
the
third
factor
force
in
larsons
theory
mass
stays
constant
and
force
drops
toward
zero
force
is
actually
a
motion
or
combinations
of
motions
or
relations
between
motions
including
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
the
expansion
of
the
universe
for
example
is
an
outward
scalar
motion
inherent
in
the
universe
and
not
a
result
of
the
socalled
big
bang
which
is
yet
another
mathematical
fantasy
the
universe
of
motion
i
wish
to
recommend
to
everyone
the
book
the
universe
of
motion
by
dewey
b
larson
north
pacific
publishers
po
box
portland
oregon
pages
indexed
hardcover
it
contains
the
astrophysical
portions
of
a
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
that
author
an
unrecognized
genius
more
than
thirty
years
ago
it
contains
final
solutions
to
most
all
astrophysical
mysteries
including
the
formation
of
galaxies
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
the
true
origin
of
the
background
radiation
cosmic
rays
and
gamma
ray
bursts
and
the
true
nature
of
quasars
pulsars
white
dwarfs
exploding
galaxies
etc
it
contains
what
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
are
all
looking
for
if
they
are
ready
to
seriously
consider
it
with
open
minds
the
following
is
an
example
of
his
theorys
success
in
his
first
book
in
the
structure
of
the
physical
universe
larson
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
larsons
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
an
immediate
related
explanation
for
them
also
gammaray
bursts
astrophysicists
and
astronomers
are
still
scratching
their
heads
about
the
mysterious
gammaray
bursts
they
were
originally
thought
to
originate
from
neutron
stars
in
the
disc
of
our
galaxy
but
the
new
gamma
ray
telescope
now
in
earth
orbit
has
been
detecting
them
in
all
directions
uniformly
and
their
source
locations
in
space
do
not
correspond
to
any
known
objects
except
for
a
few
cases
of
directional
coincidence
gammaray
bursts
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
according
to
page
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
published
in
the
gammaray
bursts
are
coming
from
supernova
explosions
in
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
which
larson
calls
the
cosmic
sector
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
antimatter
and
material
halves
of
the
physical
universe
and
the
way
they
are
connected
together
the
gammaray
bursts
can
pop
into
our
material
half
anywhere
in
space
seemingly
at
random
this
is
why
the
source
locations
of
the
bursts
do
not
correspond
with
known
objects
and
come
from
all
directions
uniformly
i
wonder
how
close
to
us
in
space
a
source
location
would
have
to
be
for
a
gammaray
burst
to
kill
all
or
most
life
on
earth
there
would
be
no
way
to
predict
one
nor
to
stop
it
perhaps
some
of
the
mass
extinctions
of
the
past
which
are
now
being
blamed
on
impacts
of
comets
and
asteroids
were
actually
caused
by
nearby
gammaray
bursts
larsonian
binary
star
formation
about
half
of
all
the
stars
in
the
galaxy
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sun
are
binary
or
double
but
orthodox
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
still
have
no
satisfactory
theory
about
how
they
form
or
why
there
are
so
many
of
them
but
binary
star
systems
are
actually
a
likely
consequence
of
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
i
will
try
to
summarize
larsons
explanation
which
is
detailed
in
chapter
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
and
in
some
of
his
other
books
first
of
all
according
to
larson
stars
do
not
generate
energy
by
fusion
a
small
fraction
comes
from
slow
gravitational
collapse
the
rest
results
from
the
complete
annihilation
of
heavy
elements
heavier
than
iron
each
element
has
a
destructive
temperature
limit
the
heavier
the
element
is
the
lower
is
this
limit
a
stars
internal
temperature
increases
as
it
grows
in
mass
via
accretion
and
absorption
of
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
gradually
reaching
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
lighter
and
lighter
elements
when
the
internal
temperature
of
the
star
reaches
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
iron
there
is
a
type
i
supernova
explosion
this
is
because
there
is
so
much
iron
present
and
that
is
related
to
the
structure
of
iron
atoms
and
the
atom
building
process
which
larson
explains
in
some
of
his
books
better
than
i
can
when
the
star
explodes
the
lighter
material
on
the
outer
portion
of
the
star
is
blown
outward
in
space
at
less
than
the
speed
of
light
the
heavier
material
in
the
center
portion
of
the
star
was
already
bouncing
around
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
because
of
the
high
temperature
the
explosion
pushes
that
material
over
the
speed
of
light
and
it
expands
outward
in
time
which
is
equivalent
to
inward
in
space
and
it
often
actually
disappears
for
a
while
over
long
periods
of
time
both
masses
start
to
fall
back
gravitationally
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
space
now
starts
to
form
a
red
giant
star
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
time
starts
to
form
a
white
dwarf
star
both
stars
then
start
moving
back
toward
the
main
sequence
from
opposite
directions
on
the
hr
diagram
the
chances
of
the
two
masses
falling
back
into
the
exact
same
location
in
space
making
a
single
lone
star
again
are
near
zero
they
will
instead
form
a
binary
system
orbiting
each
other
according
to
larson
a
white
dwarf
star
has
an
inverse
density
gradient
is
densest
at
its
surface
because
the
material
at
its
center
is
most
widely
dispersed
blown
outward
in
time
this
eliminates
the
need
to
resort
to
mathematical
fantasies
about
degenerate
matter
neutron
stars
black
holes
etc
larsonian
solar
system
formation
if
the
mass
of
the
heavy
material
at
the
center
of
the
exploding
star
is
relatively
small
then
instead
of
a
single
white
dwarf
star
there
will
be
several
mini
white
dwarf
stars
revolving
around
the
red
giant
star
but
probably
still
too
far
away
in
threedimensional
time
to
be
affected
by
its
heat
etc
these
will
become
planets
in
chapter
of
the
universe
of
motion
larson
used
all
this
information
and
other
principles
of
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
to
derive
his
own
version
of
bodes
law
black
hole
fantasy
i
heard
that
physicist
stephen
w
hawking
recently
completed
a
theoretical
mathematical
analysis
of
two
black
holes
merging
together
into
a
single
black
hole
and
concluded
that
the
new
black
hole
would
have
more
mass
than
the
sum
of
the
two
original
black
holes
such
a
result
should
be
recognized
by
everyone
as
a
red
flag
causing
widespread
doubt
about
the
whole
idea
of
black
holes
etc
after
reading
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
books
about
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
especially
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
it
is
clear
to
me
that
black
holes
are
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
the
strange
object
at
cygnus
is
just
an
unusually
massive
white
dwarf
star
not
the
black
hole
that
orthodox
astronomers
and
physicists
so
badly
want
to
prove
their
theory
by
the
way
i
do
not
understand
why
so
much
publicity
is
being
given
to
physicist
stephen
hawking
the
physicists
and
astronomers
seem
to
be
acting
as
if
hawkings
severe
physical
problem
somehow
makes
him
wiser
it
does
not
i
wish
the
same
attention
had
been
given
to
physicist
dewey
b
larson
while
he
was
still
alive
widespread
publicity
and
attention
should
now
be
given
to
larsons
theory
books
and
organization
the
international
society
of
unified
science
electromagnetic
propulsion
i
heard
of
that
concept
many
years
ago
in
connection
with
ufos
and
unorthodox
inventors
but
i
never
was
able
to
find
out
how
or
why
they
work
or
how
they
are
constructed
i
found
a
possible
clue
about
why
they
might
work
on
pages
of
the
book
basic
properties
of
matter
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
which
describes
part
of
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
i
quote
one
paragraph
as
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
universe
of
motion
arrives
at
a
totally
different
concept
of
the
nature
of
electrical
resistance
the
electrons
we
find
are
derived
from
the
environment
it
was
brought
out
in
volume
i
larsons
book
nothing
but
motion
that
there
are
physical
processes
in
operation
which
produce
electrons
in
substantial
quantities
and
that
although
the
motions
that
constitute
these
electrons
are
in
many
cases
absorbed
by
atomic
structures
the
opportunities
for
utilizing
this
type
of
motion
in
such
structures
are
limited
it
follows
that
there
is
always
a
large
excess
of
free
electrons
in
the
material
sector
material
half
of
the
universe
most
of
which
are
uncharged
in
this
uncharged
state
the
electrons
cannot
move
with
respect
to
extension
space
because
they
are
inherently
rotating
units
of
space
and
the
relation
of
space
to
space
is
not
motion
in
open
space
therefore
each
uncharged
electron
remains
permanently
in
the
same
location
with
respect
to
the
natural
reference
system
in
the
manner
of
a
photon
in
the
context
of
the
stationary
spatial
reference
system
the
uncharged
electron
like
the
photon
is
carried
outward
at
the
speed
of
light
by
the
progression
of
the
natural
reference
system
all
material
aggregates
are
thus
exposed
to
a
flux
of
electrons
similar
to
the
continual
bombardment
by
photons
of
radiation
meanwhile
there
are
other
processes
to
be
discussed
later
whereby
electrons
are
returned
to
the
environment
the
electron
population
of
a
material
aggregate
such
as
the
earth
therefore
stabilizes
at
an
equilibrium
level
note
that
in
larsons
theory
uncharged
electrons
are
also
massless
and
are
basically
photons
of
light
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
spinning
around
one
axis
at
a
particular
rate
below
the
unit
rate
unit
velocity
is
the
speed
of
light
and
there
are
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
to
the
speed
of
light
according
to
larsons
theory
i
might
have
the
above
and
below
labels
mixed
up
larson
is
saying
that
outer
space
is
filled
with
mass
less
uncharged
electrons
flying
around
at
the
speed
of
light
if
this
is
true
then
the
electromagnetic
propulsion
fields
of
spacecraft
might
be
able
to
interact
with
these
electrons
or
other
particles
in
space
perhaps
giving
them
a
charge
and
mass
and
shooting
them
toward
the
rear
to
achieve
propulsion
in
larsons
theory
an
electrical
charge
is
a
onedimensional
rotational
vibration
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
superimposed
on
the
rotation
of
the
particle
the
paragraph
quoted
above
might
also
give
a
clue
to
confused
meteorologists
about
how
and
why
lightning
is
generated

clouds

this

all
about

how

settled

etc
a
large
portion
of
the

was
about
the
mountain
meadows
massacre
the
program
very
specifically
pointed
out
that
brigham
young
knew
nothing
about
the
incident
until
long
after
it
had
happened
before

all

wrong
about

i
think
they
are
correct
in
thinking
that
a

but
i
think
they
are
wrong
if
they
think
that
you
can
set
off
bombs
and
still
be
a
buddhist
maybe
what
we
are
seeing
here
is
that
chinese
cultural
genocide
against
the
tibetans
has
worked
well
enough
that
some
tibetans
are
now
no
longer
buddhist
and
are
instead
willing
to
behave
like
the
chinese
occupiers
every
action
is
its
own
reward
clearly
the
occupation
of
tibet
has
been
largely
ignored
on
the
other
hand
people
who
are
aware
of
the
occupation
are
mostly
full
of
admiration
for
the
peaceful
way
that
tibetans
have
put
up
with
it
and
what
does
it
cost
us
to
admire
them
zip
are
tibetans
currently
people
of
peace
do
they
serve
themselves
well
or
badly
by
being
so
yes
they
are
and
whether
this
serves
them
well
or
not
depends
on
whether
they
want
buddhist
principles
or
political
independence
and
without
political
independence
can
they
preserve
their
cultural
and
religious
traditions
would
an
increased
level
of
violence
make
them
terrorists
the
chinese
would
certainly
refer
to
them
as
terrorists
just
as
the
hitler
regime
used
to
refer
to
european
resistance
movements
as
terrorists
assuming
that
the
group
advocating
this
course
is
correct
and
greater
attention
is
focussed
on
the
occupation
of
tibet
by
the
chinese
are
the
tibetans
better
off
as
people
of
peace
or
as
terrorists
better
off
in
what
way
as
proponents
of
pacifism
or
as
proponents
of
political
autonomy
and
better
off
in
what
timescale
the
soviet
empire
practised
cultural
genocide
against
something
like
a
hundred
small
minorities
some
of
which
resisted
violently
and
some
of
which
did
not
but
in
the
end
it
was
the
soviet
empire
that
collapsed
and
at
least
some
of
the
minorities
survived
now
some
of
the
minorities
are
fighting
one
another
is
that
because
they
have
to

because
violent
resistance
to
an
oppressive

legitimized

a
babys
innocence
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
baby
is
a
sinner
innocence
and
the
sin
nature
are
two
different
attributes
the
baby
is
innocent
yet
the
baby
is
a
sinner
you
have
two
arms
and
two
legs
why
because
your
parents
did
why
because
their
parents
did
etc
did
you
do
anything
to
get
them
the
thing
is
i
know
what
arms
and
legs
are
its
therefore
generally
easy
to
tell
whether
or
not
someone
has
arms
and
legs
this
sinful
nature
since
it
does
not
require
that
the
baby
actually
perform
any
sins
seems
to
be
totally
invisible
as
far
as
i
know
maybe
half
the
babies
have
a
sinful
nature
and
half
dontitd
look
exactly
the
same
since
there
is
no
way
to
tell
the
difference
we
are
born
sinners
we
are
born
sinners
because
our
parents
were
born
with
it
we
got
it
from
them
we
did
nothing
to
earn
the
title
sinner
we
get
it
because
our
parents
had
it
their
parents
had
it
their
grandparents
had
it
etc
infinitum
so
whats
so
bad
about
a
sinful
nature
then
i
could
understand
it
being
bad
if
it
always
results
in
people
committing
sins
but
babies
can
have
it
never
commit
sins
die
and
they
still
have
it
so
the
bad
part
about
cant
merely
be
that
it
results
in
people
committing
sinsso

i

pop

trying

i
am
not

if
this
is
even
possible
though
i
feel
that
that

weve
taken

just
talking

not

curious
to
know
if
christians
ever
read
books
based
on
critique
on
the
religion
classical
text
such
as
age
of
reason
by
paine
or
the
myth
maker
by
jacobi
sometimes
it
is
good
to
know
your
enemy
and
if
you
want
to
do
serious
research
you
have
to
understand
both
sides
and
not
solely
the
one
and
only
right
one
yes
one
does
i
examined
a
critique
of
the
book
of
romans
by
i
think
benjamin
franklin
once
a
deist
i
found
it
amazing
that
benjamin
franklin
missed
the
whole
boat
i
also
have
the
writings
on
thomas
jefferson
sitting
on
my
shelf
and
it
is
amazing
how
much
he
missed
i
have
studied
platos
theory
of
forms
and
aristotelian
hylomorphesism
what
a
pile
of
junk
jesus
makes
plato
and
aristotle
look
like
kindergardeners
psychology
the
id
ego
superego
by
freud
elements
of
truth
but
jesus
explained
it
far
better
and
gave
reasons
thomas
paine
benjamin
franklin
thomas
jefferson
are
mere
men
they
can
screw
up
the
bible
just
as
well
as
any
man
i
do
not
put
these
men
on
a
pedestal
and
if
i
remember
tjs
autobiography
correctly
he
thought
thomas
paine
was
the
most
unread
man
he
ever
met
heres
some
more
circular
reasoning
to
you
paul
says
to
the
corinthians
that
that
the
gospel
will
be
foolishness
to
the
world
because
it
is
spiritually
discerned
and
so
people
without
the
spirit
of
god
havent
a
clue
to
what
the
bible
is
saying
from
your
point
of
view
thats
incredibly
circular
and
convenient
to
me
it
is
mysteriously
and
supernaturally
bizarre
i
can
see
it
but
you
cant
this
is
not
arrogance
on
my
part
trust
me
it
is
as
bizarre
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
truth
explainable
or
not
are
any
of
you
color
blind
to
red
and
green
i
am
remember
those
dot
tests
they
do
at
the
optomologists
they
put
pictures
in
front
of
you
and
you
are
supposed
to
identify
the
pattern
in
the
dots
if
your
eyes
are
perfectly
normal
you
can
see
letters
or
numerals
embedded
in
the
dots
they
are
a
slightly
different
color
and
stand
out
from
the
background
but
if
you
are
color
blind
to
red
and
green
you
will
not
see
anything
but
grayshaded
dots
that
is
how
a
dot
test
appears
to
me
i
do
not
see
a
pattern
at
all
a
normal
seeing
person
will
see
the
patterns
and
to
him
i
seem
like
a
total
anomaly
to
him
i
appear
as
if
i
am
missing
the
universe
or
something
it
is
hard
for
him
to
understand
why
i
cant
see
anything
that
to
him
is
as
plain
as
day
that
it
what
it
is
like
with
the
bible
the
word
of
god
to
the
believer
the
believer
can
see
the
meaning
in
the
words
i
can
see
how
the
patterns
fit
together
there
is
such
depth
such
consistency
but
then
on
the
other
hand
i
notice
the
nonbeliever
he
doesnt
see
it
he
thinks
i
am
weird
because
he
thinks
i
am
seeing
things
i
look
at
him
and
say
no
you
are
weird
you
do
not
see
then
it
is
time
for
a
sanity
check
i
go
to
another
christian
and
say
do
you
see
this
and
they
go
yes
it
is
an
x
and
i
say
thank
god
i
see
the
x
too
it
is
truly
the
strangest
thing
it
adds
a
little
extra
dimension
to
the

orthodox
is
a

it

from

straight
true

from

opinion

i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teaching
as
opposed
to
universal
or
catholic
or
foursquare
gosple
i
think
that
the
greek
orthodox
church
would
take
high
offense
at
your
misuse
of
the
word
your
version
of
christianity
is
neither
mainstream
nor
bible
derived
you
make
claims
of
biblecentricity
that
are
not
derivable
soley
from
the
bible
about
sixseven
months
ago
you
claimed
that
your
primary
objection
to
the
lds
was
that
our
doctrine
was
not
biblederived
and
now
this
and
other
claims
can
be
shown
are
also
not
bible
interpeting
bible
right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting
god
speak
to
us
through
the
bible
this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
simple
truths
oh
for
example
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
luke
records
christs
promise
to
the
repentant
thief
who
hung
on
an
adjacent
cross
truly
i
say
to
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradise
but
was
it
not
until
later
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
to
heaven
if
christ
himself
was
not
in
heaven
until
sunday
how
could
the
repentant
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lies
in
the
location
of
paradise
when
jesus
died
apparently
paradise
was
not
exalted
to
heaven
until
easter
day
paradise
exalted
to
heaven
paradise
wasnt
equal
to
heaven
and
now
it
is
yet
you
claim
that
peeple
can
not
be
exalted
to
heaven
nicht
wahr
jesus
refers
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
story
of
the
rich
man
and
lazarus
as
abrahams
bosom
to
which
the
godly
beggar
lazarus
was
carried
by
the
angels
after
his
decease
luke
thus
abrahams
bosom
referred
to
the
place
where
the
souls
of
the
redeemed
waited
till
the
day
of
christs
resurrection
when
i
read
the
story
i
found
that
abrahams
bosom
wasnt
so
much
a
place
but
somewhere
the
rich
man
could
see
and
talk
to
abraham
it
was
not
yet
lifted
to
heaven
but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hades
hebrew
sheol
reserved
for
believers
who
had
died
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admitted
into
the
glorious
presence
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redemption
had
actually
been
paid
on
calvary
or
even
that
none
would
precede
the
presence
of
jesus
back
to
glory
with
the
father
gee
this
is
fairly
close
to
what
the
lds
call
spirit
prison
and
what
you
have
called
false
doctrine
doubtless
it
was
the
infernal
paradise
that
the
souls
of
jesus
and
the
repentant
thief
repaired
after
they
each
died
on
friday
afternoon
but
on
sunday
after
the
risen
christ
had
first
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
john
and
her
two
companions
matthew
presumably
he
then
took
up
with
him
to
glory
all
the
inhabitants
of
infernal
paradise
including
abraham
lazarus
and
the
repentant
thief
we
read
in
ephesians
concerning
christ
ascending
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
he
gave
gifts
unto
men
vers
deleted
reproduced
below
quoted
from
the
sunspot
gopher
archive
presumably
he
led
the
whole
band
of
liberated
captives
from
hades
ie
the
whole
population
of
preresurrection
paradise
up
to
the
glory
of
heaven
this
part
is
not
supported
from
scripture
nor
does
it
support
your
claim
that
the
paradise
where
christ
descended
was
exalted
making
such
claims
on
this
little
evidence
ignores
the
witness
of
the
scripture
sunephas
sun
wherefore
he
saith
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity

captive

that
the

might
dwell
amoung
them

sunephas

now
that
he
ascended
what
is
it
but
that
he
also
descended
first
sun
into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
he
that
descended
is
the
same
sun
also
that
ascended
up
far
above
all
heavens
that
he
might
fill
all
sun
things
and
he
gave
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
sun
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
sun
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
sun
edifying
of
the
body
of
christ
till
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
sun
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
man
sun
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fulness
of
christ
that
we
sun
henceforth
be
no
more
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
sun
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
sleight
of
men
and
cunning
sun
craftiness
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
but
speaking
the
sun
truth
in
love
may
grow
up
into
him
in
all
things
which
is
the
head
using
this
to
argue
that
paradise
or
spirit
prison
is
now
changed
from
a
preeaster
postion
to
posteaster
by
god
postion
is
not
supportable
makeing
such
a
claim
requires
more
evidence
than
you
have
given
here
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
ra
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
think
that
this
characterization
is
faulty
whenever
my
personal
interpretation
is
questioned
i
usually
give
a
reason
yes
and
your
reasons
are
in
general
not
supported
by
any
direct
reading
of
the
scriptures
you
have
demonstrated
that
you
claims
to
scriptural
proof
need
to
be
crosschecked
the
referencs
that
you
supply
often
do
not
support
your
postion
if
they
are
read
in
the
context
of
the
scripture
as
for
those
that
see
things
differently
please
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
difference
and
we
can
discuss
it
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
how
about
that
those
who
have
been
in
paradise
and
have
accepted
the
gosple
will
be
judged
of
jesus
christ
and
then
return
to
the
presence
of
god
is
that
somehow
different
from
your
expressed
view
that
the
paradise
spoken
of
or
abrahams
bosom
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there
are
other
views
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scripture
and
then
we
can
go
on
should
we
go
back
and
discuss
your
view
on
why
the
angle
of

lord
is

there

there
is
a

very

this

three

the

this
is
possible

it

that

perhaps
you
should
read
it
and
stop
advancing
the
bible
as
evidence
relating
to
questions
of
science
it
did
jesus
exist
by
g
a
wells
there
is
a
great
fallacy
in
your
statement
the
question
of
origins
is
based
on
more
than
science
alone
nope
no
fallacy
yep
science
is
best
in
determining
how
religions
handle
why
and
who
rich
i
am
curious
as
to
why
you
and
others
award
custody
of
the
baby
to
theists
and
religion
i
hope
i
didnt
award
custody
rich
i
purposely
used
handle
in
order
to
avoid
doing
so
ie
that
happens
to
be
what
religions
do
of
course
there
are
aberrations
like
scientific
creationism
i
used
best
in
part
to
indicate
that
science
currently
has
a
time
of
it
with
why
and
who
so
these
domains
are
mostly
ignored
i
also
attempted
to
be
brief
which
no
doubt
confused
the
matter
as
an
aside
for
science
i
should
have
written
how
and
when
nobody
seems
to
argue
over
what
are
they
theists
theologians
any
better
equiped
to
investigate
the
who
and
why
than
magicians
astrologers
housewives
not
being
sexists
athiests
or
agnostics
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
would
vary
from
individual
to
individual
im
not
trying
to
be
evasive
on
this
but
from
a
societal
perspective
religion
works
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
it
is
abused
and
misused
and
many
suffer
which
you
know
but
the
net
result
seems
positive
this
from
the
anthropological
perspective
on
human
affairs
you
might
call
me
a
neofruedian
insofar
as
i
think
the
masses
cant
get
along
without
religion
not
that
generally
they
are
incapable
they
just
dont
and
for
myriad
reasons
but
the
main
one
seems
to
be
the
promise
of
immortality
very
seductive
that
immortality
therefore
it
seems
that
theologians
are
better
equipped
than
the
others
you
mention
for
dispensing
answers
to
who
and
why
i
suggest
that
this
holds
regardless
of
the
truth
in
their
answers
to
who
and
why
simply
because
people
believe
in
the
end
spiritual
beliefs
are
just
as
real
as
scientific
facts
and
explanation
caution
to
some
do
not
take
this
out
of
context
do
you
suggest
that
the
who
and
why
will
forever
be
closed
to
scientific
investigation
no
in
fact
i
dont
think
it
is
closed
now
at
least
for
some
individuals
isnt
there
a
group
of
theoretical
physicists
who
argue
that
matter
was
created
from
nothing
in
a
big
bang
singularity
this
approach
might
presuppose
an
absence
of
who
and
why
except
that
it
seems
it
could
be
argued
that
something
had
to
be
responsible
for
nothing
maybe
that
something
doesnt
have
to
be
supernatural
maybe
just
mechanistic
but
thats
a
tough
one
for
people
today
to
grasp
in
any
case
theory
without
empirical
data
is
not
explanation
but
then
your
question
does
not
require
data
in
other
words
i
agree
that
theorizing
within
scientific
parameters
is
just
as
scientific
as
explaining
so
the
answer
is
who
and
why
are
not
closed
to
scientists
but
i
sense
that
science
in
these
realms
is
currently
very
inadequate
data
will
be
necessary
for
improvement
and
that
seems
a
long
way
off
if
ever
pretty
convoluted
here
i
hope
ive
made
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
or
so
years
ago
the
question
of
the
origin
of
life
on
earth
was
not
considered
open
to
scientific
enquiry
i
agree
generally
but
i
prefer
to
put
it
this
way
the
questions
of
how
when
who
and
why
were
not
open
to
inquiry
during
the
enlightenment
reason
was
reponsible
for
questioning
the
theological
answers
to
how
and
when
and
not
for
the
most
part
who
and
why
science
was
thus
born
out
of
the
naturalists
curiosity
eventually
carting
away
the
how
and
when
while
largely
leaving
behind
the
who
and

subject
hell
in
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
there
are
three
differents
words
translated
into
the
word
hell
these
greek
words
have
totally
different
meanings
the
words
are
hades
tartaros
and
gehenna
in
bibical
usage
the
greek
word
hades
is
used
only
times
in
the
new
testament
and
is
roughly
the
equivalent
to
the
old
testament
word
sheol
meaning
the
grave
or
pit
compare
acts
with
psalms
hades
may
be
likened
to
a
hole
in
the
ground
in
the
bible
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
fire
most
modern
bibical
translators
admit
that
the
use
in
the
english
word
hell
to
translate
hades
and
sheol
are
an
unfortunate
and
misleading
practice
why
because
when
seeing
the
word
hell
many
readers
impute
to
it
the
traditional
connotation
of
an
everburning
inferno
when
this
was
never
remotely
intended
in
the
greek
language
or
in
old
english
in
its
true
bibical
usage
hades
does
indeed
refer
to
the
state
or
abode
of
the
dead
but
not
in
the
sense
of
spirits
walking
around
in
some
sort
of
shadowy
realm
hades
is
simply
the
abode
we
call
the
grave
all
dead
go
to
this
hell
the
second
hell
of
the
bible
tartaros
is
mentioned
only
once
in
scripture
for
if
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
tartaros
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment
following
their
rebellion
to
unseat
god
from
his
throne
the
archangel
lucifer
now
satan
and
a
third
of
the
created
angels
now
demons
were
ejected
from
heaven
luke
they
were
cast
down
to
tartaros
a
place
or
condition
of
restraint
that
god
has
imposed
on
the
mutinous
angels
as
they
await
ultimate
judgment
jude
tartaros
then
is
a
hell
that
applies
only
to
evil
rebellious
angels
or
demons
it
is
interesting
that
the
ancient
greeks
used
this
word
to
describe
the
place
in
which
zeus
confined
the
rebellious
titans
nowhere
in
the
bible
is
there
any
mention
of
men
being
put
into
this
particular
hell
the
the
third
word
that
is
translated
as
hell
in
the
bible
is
gehenna
it
comes
from
the
hebrew
gai
hinnom
meaning
valley
of
hinniom
hinnom
is
a
deep
narrow
ravine
located
to
the
south
and
southwest
of
jerusalem
in
old
testament
times
it
was
a
place
of
abominable
pagan
rites
including
infant
sacrifice
it
was
there
that
the
apostate
kings
ahaz
and
manasseh
made
their
children
pass
through
the
fire
to
the
god
molech
the
rites
were
specifically
celebrated
in
tophet
the
place
of
abhorrence
one
of
the
chief
groves
in
the
valley
king
josiah
of
ancient
judah
finally
put
an
end
to
these
abominations
he
defiled
the
valley
rendering
it
ceremonially
unclean
kings
later
the
valley
became
the
cesspool
and
city
dump
of
jerusalem
a
repository
for
sewage
refuse
and
animal
carcasses
the
bodies
of
dispised
criminals
were
also
burned
there
along
with
the
rubbish
fires
burned
continuously
feeding
by
a
constant
supply
of
garbage
and
refuse
aceldama
the
field
of
blood
purchased
with
the
money
judas
received
for
the
betrayal
of
christ
was
also
in
part
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
so
what
does
this
valley
called
gehenna
have
to
do
with
hell
in
the
satan
inspired
political
dictator
and
a
miracleworking
religious
figure
the
false
prophet
working
with
him
will
resist
the
reestablishment
of
the
government
of
god
by
jesus
christ
at
his
second
coming
their
fate
is
revealed
by
the
apostle
john
and
the
beast
was
taken
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
these
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone
where
will
this
temporary
lake
of

this

be

years
later
satan
himself
will
be
cast
into
this
rekindled
fiery
lake
where
the
beast
and
false
prophet
were
cast
but
what
of
the
wicked
who
have
died
over
the
millennia
does
the
bible
say
that
they
are
now
suffering
fiery
punishment
for
their
sins
in
a
lake
of
fire
in
the
sequence
of
the
incorrigibly
wicked
are
resurrected
to
be
thrown
into
the
lake
of
fire
after
satan
is
cast
there
what
will
become
of
these
wicked
will
they
writhe
in
flames
for
eternity
the
wicked
will
be
burned
up
from
the
intense
heat
of
the
coming
gehenna
fire
on
the
earth
they
wil
be
consumed
annihilated
destroyed
this
punishment
will
be
everlasting
permanent
and
final
the
bible
calls
it
the
second
death
from
which
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
further
resurrection
the
bible
does
teach
eternal
punishment
but
not
eternal
punishing
the
prophet
malachi
provides
a
graphic
description
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
to
the
righteous
god
says
that
the
wicked
shall
be
ashes
under
the
soles
of
your
gehenna
was
a
place
of
destruction
and
death
not
a
place
of
living
torture
jesus
was
talking
to
jews
who
understood
all
about
this
gehenna
or
valley
of
hinnom
utter
destruction
by
fire
was
complete
nothing
was
left
but
ashes
every
text
in
the
bible
translated
from
this
greek
word
gehenna
means
complete
destruction
not
living
torture
not
eternal
life
in
torment
the
bible
says
in
romans
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
not
eternal
life
in
torture
the
punishment
revealed
in
the

is
death
the

eternal

what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
i
guess
i
ought
not
conclude
from
this
then
that
since
you
didnt
ask
to
be
created
you
dont
care
if
you
go
to
hell
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
i
dont
consider
myself
an
unthinking
sheep
the
bible
says
god
created
us
to
be
in
communion
and
obedience
to
him
the
first
and
only
rule
was
to
not
eat
of
a
certain
tree
or
else
the
punishment
is
distance
from
him
and
physical
death
gods
intention
in
creating
us
is
to
have
a
relationship
with
us
the
bible
documents
gods
attempts
to
have
that
relationship
culminating
in
the
person
of
jesus
to
bear
the
consequences
of
all
sin
so
that
all
who
accept
him
can
have
a
relationship
with
god
again
the
purpose
of
creation
who
is
god
to
impose
rules
on
us
hes
god
and
he
created
us
i
suppose
he
has
a
right
based
on
who
he
is
above
you
mention
in
his
infinite
wisdom
and
thats
what
id
say
god
exemplifies
but
if
you
were
being
sarcastic
up
there
then
this
whole
discussion
is
irrelevant
eh
and
if
we
believe
god
is
infinitely
wise
that
belief
should
inform
our
relationship
with
him

i

the

is

a
reason
here
goes
i
am
getting
married
in
june
to
a
devout
wisconsin
synod

i
would
classify
myself
as

athiest
this
has
been
a
a
subject
of
many
discussions
between
us
and
is
really
our
only
real
obstacle
we
dont
have
any
real
difficulties
with
the
religious
differences
yet
but
i
expect
they
will
pop
up
when
we
have
children
i
have
agreed
to
raise
the
children
nominally
lutheran
that
is
lutheran
traditions
but
trying
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
even
possible
though
i
feel
that
that
the
worst
quality
of
being
devoutly
religous
is
the
lack
of
an
open
mind
just
a
point
i
suppose
if
open
mind
means
believing
anything
can
be
true
or
we
cant
for
sure
know
what
is
definitely
true
im
happy
to
not
be
open
minded
if
however
open
mindedness
means
being
respectful
and
tolerant
towards
other
beliefs
respecting
the
rights
and
intelligence
and
wisdom
of
people
of
other
beliefs
and
giving
equal
time
to
alternative
ideas
i
try
my
very
best
to
be
open
minded
just
a
thot
in
passing
anyway
i
guess
ill
get
on
with
my
question
is
anyone
in
the
same
situation
and
can
give
some
suggestions
as
to
how
to
deal
with
this
weve
taken
the
attitude
so
far
of
just
talking
about
it
a
lot
and
not
letting
anything
get
bottled
up
inside
sometimes
i
get
the
feeling
were
making
this
much
bigger
than
it
actually
is
any
comments
would
be
greatly
appreciated
also
please
email
responses
since
i
dont
get
a
chance
to
read
this
group
often
not
being
married
i
cannot
say
too
much
to
you
but
from
my
perspective
having
mutually
exclusive
faiths
would
be
a
big
enough
roadblock
for
me
in
considering
marrying
someone
making
it
much
bigger
than
it
is
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
serious
each
of
you
is
in
your
beliefs
lukewarm
atheists
and
christians
for
whom
religion
is
of
nominal
importance
probly
would
feel
the
issue
isnt
very
big
i
suppose
the
more
important
your
beliefs
are
to
each
of
you

i

i
use
it
obviously
only
in

practice

well
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
it
its
similar
to
collecting
coins

stamps
or
campaign
buttons
or
coke
bottles
or
juke
boxes
or
model

or
just
about
anything
else
that
is

just
about
everything
is
collected
in
all
cases
you
might
consider
it
something
of
an
aberration
i
mean
what
purpose
does
it
serve
not
much
really
its
just
a
hobby
the

yearns
for

not

this
is

and
so
on
some
people
use
their

other
people
do
not
as
you
state
you
use
your
collection
in
one
sense
this
diminishes
the
value
of
your
collection
as
the
items
suffer
wear
and
exposure
in
another
sense
it
can
enhance
your

some

collect

the
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
while
they
can
expose
a
lot
of
deception
they
can
also
become
inquisitors
as
one
who
agrees
with
much
of
what
they
say
i
am
also
on
the
receiving
end
and
it
makes
me
realize
the
importance
of
respecting
the
freedom
of
belief
of
every
individual
and
also
of
not
jumping
to
conclusions
and
making
accusations
based
on
a
priori
assumptions
about
an
individual
or
group
for
my
money
the
primary
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
they
are
every
bit
as
wacky
as
the
groups
they
oppose
and
that
by
and
large
they
have
no
compunctions
about
printing
lies
halftruths
and
misleading
innuendos
as
part
of
their
exposes
a
recent
book
on
cults
i
picked
up
by
a
christian
author
quite
simply
mixed
in
all
nonchristian
religions
except
the
jews
and
various
new
age
groups
with
various
fringe
groups
of
dubious
intent
and
legality
on
the
other
hand
the
watchman
fellowship
does
a
good
service
in
exposing
deceptive
practices
that
are
far
too
common
among
the
groups
they
monitor
given
the
record
of
american
christianity
any
group
that
falls
into
the
category
of
fundamentalist
or
bornagain
is
automatically
into
the
inquisition
business
it
is
an
unavoidable
affliction
of
those
who
have
a
proprietary
license
on
the
truth
tm
and
lets
not
forget
that
jonestown
and
the
branch
davidians
are
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
christian
tradition
as
the
missouri
synod
lutherans

has
pointed

to
me
that
homosexuality
is
a
sin
in
the
bible
well
i
dont
see
how
it
could
be
considered
a
sin
first
of
all
as
far
as
i
know
only
male
homosexuality
is
explicitly
mentioned
in

bibles
so
youre
off
the
hook
there
i
think
in
any
event
there
are
plenty
of
people
in

denominations
who
do
not
consider
a

sexual
identification

lifestyle
choice
also
i
have
always
been
a

liberal

it

that
being
prochoice

being

dont
mix
either
i

this
is
another
misconception
you

several

gay

lesbian
ministers
i
am
a

and
like
most
others
in
my
denomination
am
prochoice
you
neednt
go
looking
to
the
unitarian
universalists
which
is
a
liberal
religion
for
acceptance
of
your
sexual
identification
and
prochoice
views
however
there
are
many

who
believe

sometimes
these

contained

flames
leap
up
hours
a
day
from
a
gleaming
brass
urn
in
a
temple
one
of
only
four
in
the
united
states
dedicated
to
one
of
the
worlds
most
ancient
religions
with
the
flames
go
the
prayers
of
about
bay
area
zoroastrians
that
their
faith
will
survive
this
land
there
is
a
fear
a
real
fear
too
said
silloo
tarapore
of
lafayette
we
have
one
generation
to
do
it
or
to
die
many
immigrant
groups
struggle
to
maintain
an
identity
in
a
strange
land
but
for
zoroastrians
it
is
an
especially
poignant
concern
their
religion
has
been
around
for
perhaps
years
a
heritage
so
deep
it
scarcely
seems
comprehensible
in
a
state
where
historical
sites
are
sometimes
less
than
years
old
it
was
the
religion
of
the
great
persian
empire
under
kings
cyrus
and
darius
and
tradition
says
that
when
christ
was
born
about
years
later
he
was
honored
by
a
visit
from
three
zoroastrian
priests
the
magi
scholars
say
many
key
beliefs
of
christians
jews
and
muslims
can
be
traced
to
the
teachings
of
zoroaster
the
zoroastrian
prophet
yet
with
only
about
zoroastrians
in
the
entire
world
they
are
a
miniscule
minority
in
every
country
in
which
they
live
survival
as
a
people
is
very
much
on
their
minds
ironically
local
zoroastrians
fear
that
the
almost
unlimited
tolerance
of
the
united
states
may
do
what
hundreds
of
years
of
persecution
followed
by
nearly
years
of
benign
religious
segregation
could
not
do
cause
their
young
people
to
stop
thinking
of
themselves
as
zoroastrians
zoroastrians
do
not
believe
theirs
is
the
only
right
religion
and
they
actually
shun
the
notion
of
trying
to
win
converts
so
if
their
children
become
totally
assimilated
they
say
its
their
children
rather
than
the
world
at
large
who
will
be
the
losers
its
important
to
have
an
identity
said
maneck
bhujwaia
of
san
jose
a
leader
among
zoroastrians
who
came
here
from
india
its
important
for
everybody
irish
scottish
americans
it
gives
meaning
to
life
you
dont
have
to
depend
on
the
majority
community
to
give
you
respect
you
can
fall
back
on
your
own
identity
for
zoroastrians
theres
much
to
be
proud
of
their
prophet
zoroaster
seeking
to
make
sense
of
a
culture
in
which
animal
sacrifice
to
multiple
gods
was
common
preached
that
there
was
only
one
god
a
good
one
zoroastrians
call
their
god
ahura
mazda
which
translates
as
lord
of
wisdom
and
light
good
vs
evil
zoroaster
saw
life
as
a
constant
struggle
between
good
and
evil
with
the
good
eventually
winning
men
and
women
could
join
in
the
battle
for
good
he
said
and
he
warned
that
they
would
inevitably
suffer
consequences
such
as
shame
and
sorrow
if
they
did
wrong
he
preached
honesty
charity
kindness
to
animals
respect
for
the
environment
hard
work
equality
of
men
and
women
basic
virtues
preached
by
prophets
of
many
religions
but
zoroaster
was
perhaps
unusual
in
that
he
told
his
followers
not
to
follow
him
blindly
he
demanded
they
think
for
themselves
in
fact
joseph
campbell
the
famous
scholar
of
the
history
and
meaning
of
myths
traced
the
western
emphasis
on
individual
thought
to
the
zoroastrians
zoroastrians
have
many
words
for
thought
their
motto
leaded
into
a
stained
glass
window
over
the
sacred
fire
at
the
temple
on
the
slopes
of
mount
hamilton
is
good
thoughts
good
words
good
deeds
so
its
not
surprising
that
zoroastrians
value
education
highly
in
india
where
a
contingent
of
zoroastrians
arrived
in
the
ninth
century
to
escape
persecution
by
muslims
in
iran
zoroastrians
claim
percent
literacy
the
overall
statistic
in
india
is
just
percent
about
half
of
the
bay
area
zoroastrian
community
came
here
from
india
and
pakistan
mostly
to
study
at
universities
the
other
half
fled
from
iran
after
the
revolution
made
that
a
fundamentalist
islamic
state
where
others
had
no
rights
local
zoroastrians
point
with
pride
to
ways
their
emphasis
on
good
deeds
has
improved
life
in
every
country
they
inhabit
in
san
jose
the
recent
restoration
of
the
hotel
sainte
clarie
came
about
because
manou
mobedshahi

hotelier
passed

boardedup

on

from

chief
guest
of
honor
was
the
mother
of
zubin
mehta
the
zoroastrian
conductor
of
the
new
york
philharmonic
orchestra
the
temple
exists
because
of
another
good
deed
the
decision
by
an
iranian
emigre
the
late
arbab
rustom
guiv
to
buy
land
for
six
temples
in
north
america
besides
the
site
off
crothers
road
on
mount
hamilton
he
paid
for
land
in
los
angeles
chicago
new
york
toronto
and
vancouver
until
his
gifts
there
were
no
zoroastrian
temples
on
this
continent
local
zoroastrians
raised
money
to
build
the
actual
temple
and
the
property
already
had
a
large
house
that
they
have
converted
to
a
community
center
the
temple
dedicated
a
year
ago
on
the
birthday
of
the
prophet
zoroaster
is
a
simple
structure
with
gleaming
white
walls
vaulted
ceilings
and
oak
floors
partially
covered
with
huge
oriental
carpets
its
central
feature
is
the
fire
set
in
the
middle
of
a
partlyglassed
in
area
at
the
center
of
the
building
although
zoroastrians
are
sometimes
called
fire
worshippers
they
actually
consider
fire
just
a
symbol
of
god
it
helps
us
concentrate
just
like
christians
use
the
cross
and
muslims
use
the
holy
book
bhujwala
said
the
biggest
celebration
of
the
years
occurs
in
early
spring
for
all
iranians
including
zoroastrians
the
new
year
begins
on
the
first
day
of
the
season
because
of
its
symbolism
as
the
start
of
new
life
with
zoroasters
birthday
just
six
days
later
the
combination
of
religious
and
secular
holidays
creates
something
on
par
with
what
most
of
the
united

celebrates
between
christmas
and
jan
for
this

esfandiar
anoushiravani
a
leader
of
the
iranian
members
had
said
beforehand
and
what
followed
proved
him
right
inside
the
temple
worshipers
filled
every
chair
and
sat
or
stood
around
the
edges
of
the
room
as
about
a
halfdozen
priests
chanted
thanksgiving
prayers
around
a
table
laden
with
braziers
of
smoking
sandalwood
glasses
of
milk
and
water
and

tray
heaped
with
dried
fruit
and
nuts
kids
crowded
around

of

treats
people
eat
the
fruit

its
a
way
to

ceremony

sort

told
a

asked

was
going

a

john
a
sabanovich
of
folsom
said
he
became
intrigued
with
the
religion
years
ago
while
on
business
trips
to
iran
zoroastrians
have
no
procedure
for
accepting
converts
a
result
some
say
of
their
centuries
of
persecution
in
iran
followed
by
their
promise
to
the
hindu
king
who
allowed
them
into
india
that
they
would
not
interfere
with
his
peoples
religion

that
does

sabavich
from
joining
in

celebrations
at

temple
whenever
he
can
when
i

heard
about

religion
he

i

this

what
a

should
be
they
think

im
curious
to
know
what
purpose
people
think
these
lists
serve
lists
like
this
seem
to
value
quantity
over
quality
an
argument
from
article
length
and
the
list
you
have
here
is
of
poorer
quality
than
most
i
agree
which
is
why
ive
asked
for
help
with
it
the
reason
im
working
on
this
list
is
because
ive
recently
had
one
too
many
christians
tell
me
the
bible
contains
no
contradictions
whatsoever
they
believe
that
its
true
and
that
it
describes
reality
perfectly
and
even
predicts
history
before
it
happens
before
i
can
carry
on
any
sort
of
meaningful
conversation
with
these
people
ive
got
to
show
them
with
concrete
evidence
that
the
bible
is
not
nearly
as
airtight
as
they
thought
i
hope
to
do
that
with
this
list
specifically
when
i
bring
up
the
fact
that
genesis
contains
two
contradictory
creation
stories
i
usually
get
blank
stares
or
flat
denials
ive
never
had
a
fundamentalist
acknowledge
that
there
are
indeed
two
different
accounts
of

these
topics
are
all
discussed
in
the
vedas
in
fact
the
original
knowledge
of
all
these
topics
comes
from
the
vedas
therefore
they
are
not
newage
at
all
they
are
rather
old
by
any
standards
nor
is
the
popularity
they
are
currently
experiencing
something
new
one
would
think
that
the
vedas
would
be
very
popular
among
newagers
since
all
the
things
you
mention
above
are
thoroughly
described
in
them
isnt
that
interesting
in
the
jewish
tradition
you
are
incredibly
wrong
they
originate
in
the
torah
and
with
jewish
ancestors
specifically
the
patriarch
abraham
zl
that
knowledge
was
sent
east
to
india
and
china
when
abraham
gave
gifts
the
commentators
to
jewish
scripture
say
this
was
the
knowledge
of
the
occult
arts
to
all
the
rest
of
his
children
when
he
sent
them
away
to
the
east
this
assured
that
isaac
only
who
remained
with
abraham
would
inherit
his
most
important
spiritual
gifts
what
eventually
became
judaism
so
you
see
other
religions
can
have
very
parochial
views
too
by
the
jewish
view
you
are
very
mistaken
your
scripture
are
not
scripture
your
gods
are
not
gods
your
practices
a
jumble
of
errors
that
lead
people
to
idol
worship
and
away
from
god
that
doesnt
stop
us
from
respecting
you
to
the
extent
of
not
trying
to
convert
you
or
proselytize
you
and
being
willing
to
dialog
in
a
respectful
manner
were
content
to
let
you
live
the
way
you
care
to
live
as
long
as
you
leave
us
be
we
are
happy
to
coexist
as
long
as
you
give
us
the
same
right
but
your
incredible
rudeness
and
violent
nature
seems
to
preclude
that
too
bad
is
this
typical
of
your
religion
however
there
is
one
difference
between
the
newage
practitioner
and
the
actual
follower
of
the
vedic
teachings
the
typical
newager
desires
to
acquire
all
the
material
powers
and
opulences
mentioned
in
the
vedas
without
referring
to
their
source
the
lord
he
wants
the
kingdom
of
god
without
god
he
wants
personal
power
without
the
responsibility
of
acknowledging
its
source
without
the
person
from
whom
that
power
comes
in
other
words
he
is
just
plain
selfish
you
are
a
most
presumptuous
fellow
how
dare
you
presume
that
the
typical
new
ager
doesnt
acknowledge
god
and
is
selfish
what
trite
selfrighteous
egoful
garbage
there
are
buddhists
christians
jews
and
those
of
many
other
religions
here
on
this
newsgroups
for
whom
your
words
are
simple
slander
the
vedic
follower
on
the
other
hand
knows
that
no
matter
what
one
desires
one
must
worship
god
and
the
vedas
give
a
complete
description
of
exactly
who
is
god
so
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
in
his
identification
for
this
reason
the
parts
of
the
vedas
that
deal
directly
with
the
personality
of
godhead
are
not
very
popular
among
newagers
and
anyone
who
presents
the
complete
vedas
as
they
are
is
branded
as
an
evangelist
as
if
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
even
though
he
is
simply
presenting
the
unadulterated
vedic
teachings
of
course
from
the
jewish
perspective
you
are
incredibly
wrong
wed
say
that
there
is
no
godhead
just
created
beings
who
may
be
enjoying
a
good
laugh
at
your
expense
a
thief
takes
from
others
and
says
this
is
mine
a
newager
takes
from
god
and
says
this
is
mine
such
a
false
mystic
must
be
careful
to
avoid
coming
in
contact
with
the
real
owner
of
the
things
he
has
stolen
consequently
he
invents
an
explanation
for
these
things
that
conveniently
omits
the
identity
of
their
owner
the
lord
in
other
words
he
lies
about
where
he
got
them
so
not
only
are
we
selfish
we
are
also
thieves
and
liars
and
you
expect
any
of
us
to
pay
attention
to
you
and
your
religion
why
not
call
us
more
name
maybe
then
well
all
convert
in
gratefullness
however
the
lord
is
very
merciful
and
he
sends
his
servants
to
remind
the
newager
of
his
own
identity
as
spirit
soul
the
eternal
servant
of
god
hence
although
unwanted
the
evangelist
continues
to
broadcast
the
complete
truth
you
delude
yourself

why
because

am
a

able

i
do
not

hudson
we
are

you

you
want

who
died

made

it

it

i

i

do

if

you

admit

yes
i

you

your

correct

tells
you
that
only
agents
acting
in

of
your

have
the
right

however
other

will
say
that

and
that
they
are

that
you

so
it
goes

hudson
these

hurt

why
cant
they
hurt
other
peoples
bodies
too
me
because
other
people
might
not
want
to
be
hurt
hudson
and
hurting
them
against
their
will
is
a
violation
of
choice
hudson
so
why
is
someone
elses
will
such
a
big
deal
if
morality
is
all
relative
i
dont
believe
i
ever
said
that
morality
was
all
relative
what
i
said
was
that
i
can
make
my
mind
up
on
my
own
thank
you
and
that
you
dont
have
the
right
to
tell
others
what
to
think
i
think
that
you
will
find
that
in
most
moral
systems
there
is
a
respect
for
human
life
and
the
dignity
of
the
person
it
is
all
the
stuff
besides
these
points
that
forms
the
core
of
the
disagreement
between
primitive
moral
absolutists
like
yourself
and
the
rest
of
us
hudson
maybe
the
insane
lover
of
pain
might
reason
if
other
people
experienced
enough
pain
they
might
learn
to
enjoy
it
too
fine
there
is
still
the
clinical
definition
of
crazy
and
this
also
involves
a
violation
of
free
will
because
the
insane
lover
of
your
little
example
would
be
inflicting
pain
on
a
nonwilling
subject
try
again
hudson
you
have
to
have
other
premises
to
derive
this
me
no
you
dont
that
is
a
patently
false
statement
hudson
you
have
to
have
some
sort
of
premise
about
choice
or
selfawareness
no
you
do
not
i
demonstrated
to
you
the
example
of
the
football
team
which
doesnt
require
premises
about
freedom
of
choice
or
sentienceselfawareness
as
i
said
you
are
wrong
and
you
dont
seem
to
know
much
about
moral
systems
if
i
were
you
i
would
take
david
bolds
suggestion
and
do
some
reading
on
the
subject
before
you
try
preaching
about
it
subject
re
question
for
those
with

morality
hudson
yes
you
do
who
is
to
say
that
it
is
immoral
for
onesself
to
experience
pain
or
to
be
hurt
in
some
other
way
maybe
unpleasant
but
that
doesnt
say
anything
about
morality
it
violates
free
will
hudson
me
you
can
derive
the
immorality
of
hurting
someone
else
entirely
from
selfish
motives
i
can
say
for
example
that
it
is
wrong
to
hurt
other
people
because
that
makes
them
less
productive
members
of
society
hudson
why
is
making
someone
a
less
productive
member
of
society
immoral
hudson
you
are
screwing
up
again
morality
does
not
i
say
again
does
not
define
only
right
and
wrong
it
also
defines
acceptable
social
behavior
without
any
overtones
of
good
and
evil
picking
up
your
trash
is
not
really
a
rightwrong
moral
issue
in
the
eternal
sense
of
good
and
evil
yet
it
is
moral
in
the
sense
that
it
is
acceptable
social
behavior
your
definition
of
the
word
morality
is
what
is
causing
you
to
trip
over
yourself
here
me
and
since
i
selfish
being
that
i
am
want
to
maximize
my
gains
from
society
i
will
not
do
anything
to
another
member
of
society
if
that
action
might
cut
down
on
how
much
benefit
i
can
derive
from
society
hudson
why
is
your
benefit
somehow
related
to
morality
again
your
definition
is
causing
you
to
shoot
yourself
in
the
foot
hudson
what
about
if
someone
feels
that
their
own
personal
benefit
is
enhanced
more
than
it
would
be
damaged
by
depleting
the
overall
resources
of
society
maybe
something
might
hurt
society
but
it
would
help
him
immensly
that
is
irrational
thinking
there
may
also
be
people
out
there
who
think
that
death
by
atomic
destruction
is
a
sublime
and
wonderful
thing
i
am
not
going
to
let
them
execute
that
idea
just
because
they
want
to
do
it
simply
because
i
let
people
make
up
their
minds
about
what
morals
they
have
doesnt
prevent
me
from
spotting
and
stopping
a
madman
when
i
see
one
hudson
and
even
then
i
will
only
stop
him
when
he
interferes
with
me
and
my
life
that
is
the
difference
between
me
and
you
you
want
to
interfere
in
peoples
lives
even

arent

you
hudson
the
central
character
in
dostoevskys
novel
crime
and
punishment
r
something
or
other
reasoned
that
if
killed
this
old
jewish
woman
and
stole
her
money
to
educate
and
establish
himself
financially
he
could
make
a
great
contribution
to
society
he
reasoned
that
she
was
not
of
much
profit
to
society
she
just
collected
rents
and
hoarded
money
one
of
the
central
points
of
any
thats
any
moral
system
is
that
is
has
to
be
internally
consistent
by
killing
her
the
character
had
to
accept
the
premise
that
the
ends
justify
the
means
if
he
accepted
that
premise
then
in
order
to
be
consistent
he
must
accept
the
idea
that
some
day
another
person
may
apply
the
same
standard
to
his
life
now
if
he
is
unwilling
to
accept
this
premise
which
he
will
not
be
willing
to
accept
then
he
has
behaved
inconsistently
with

football
example
deleted
hudson
now
suppose
a
freshman
on
the
bench
will
only
get
to
play
if
one
of
the
players
in
the
fieldon
the
court
is
injured
or
killed
this
freshman
wants
to
play
in
the
big
game
so
a
talent
scout
can
see
him
if
he
hurts
a
player
on
the
team
it
might
slightly
lessen
the
chances
of
the
team
to
win
but
he
might
gain
great
personal
benefit
so
operating
on
purely
selfish
immorally
selfish
motives
he
arranges
for
a
sniper
to
shoot
a
team
player
in
the
leg
he
gets
to
play
in
front
of
the
talent
scout
did
that
freshman
behave
morally
selfish
intentions
may
sometimes
generate
apparently
moral
actions
but
not
always
two
problems
right
off
the
bat
the
problem
with
your
analogy
is
that
it
doesnt
address
the
goal
that
i
started
with
winning
the
game
playing
in
front
of
the
talent
scout
winning
the
game
try
creating
the
same
analogy
and
keep
the
ultimate
goal
the
same
will
you
the
internal
consistency
question
is
also
not
addressed
if
the
freshman
wants
to
do
this
to
other
people
then
he
has
to
accept
the
fact
that
it
may

hudson
and
from
a

point
of

it
could
be
said
that
the
nervous
system
is
just
matter
what
is
wrong
with
producing
chemical
reactions
in

because
this
matter
is
different
it
is
alive

selfaware
and
it
feels

hudson
if
all
morality
were
relative
big
hairy
deal
as
i
said
you
appear
to
be
the
only
person
saying
that
all
morality
is
relative
most
people
i
know
do
hold
some
absolutes
in
their
moral
system
i
personally
believe
that
the
dignity
of
the
individual
and
the
right
of
free
will
are
absolutes
i
recognize
that
there
are
some
moral
systems
around
which
dont
accept
this
i
reject
them
as
dangerous
and
antisocial
nazism
some
forms
of
communism
fundamentalist
xtianityno
thats
not
a
slam
but
for
the
most
part
almost
every
moral
system
agrees
on
these
two
points
me
and
the
sky
and
everything
in
it
everything
that
was
created
came
out
of
god
everything
including
this
matter
is
part
of
god
therefore
is
it
wrong
to
put
parts
of
god
in
a
test
tube
and
make
it
go
through
reactions
isnt
that
a
form
of
blasphemy
hudson
generally
christians
believe
in
a
creatorcreation
distinction
other
religions
believe
in
one
big
whole
i
dont
accept
yor
premises
too
bad
i
know
im
right
so
i
get
to
enforce
my
view
upon
you
whether
you
like
my
premise
or
not
and
since
you
cant
prove
otherwise
there
isnt
even
an
intellectual
basis
for
your
resistance
to
accepting
my
viewpoint
hudson
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
as
long
as
it
doesnt
hurt
someone
else
becomes
more
and
more
relative
until
the
only
rule
that
is
left
is
i
will
do
what
i
want
to
do
no
matter
who
it
hurts
theres
a
big
jump
between
those
two
positions
and
you
know
it
very
well
dont
play
stupid
i
realize
that
youre
trying
to
dispute
what
you
call
popular
morality
by
using
what
you
think
is
logic
but
youre
stretching
this
a
bit
too
thin
hudson
i
dont
think
so
once
morality
becomes
relative
it
degenerates
i
am
saying
that
reasoning
that
it
is
generally
evil
to
hurt
other
people
is
bad
though
i
dont
think
it
is
sufficient
well
then
answer
me
this
you
seem
to
be
opposed
to
moral
relativism
as
you
call
it
because
it
has
the
capacity
to
degenerate
obviously
then
you
would
advocate
a
nonrelative
absolute
moral
system
whose
absolutist
moral
system
do
we
choose
how
do
we
come
to
this
decision
what
about
people
who
disagree
with
the
chosen
moral
system
hudson
but
if
morality
is
considered
to
be
relative
and
this
rule
isnt
based
on
anything
but
is
just
an
arbitrary
rule
people
might
abandon
it
fine
i
can
agree
with
most
of
what
you
typed
here
however
just
because
morality
gets
based
on
something
nonrelative
does
not
mean
that
we
have
to
pick
your
xtianity
as
its
base
we
can
start
a
morality
based
on
dignity
of
humans
freedom
of
choice
tolerance
etc
and
never
ever
rely
on
xtianity
for
anything
just
because
someone
has
a
consistent
moral
system
based
on
true
principles
does
not
mean
that
they
have
to
involve
xtianity
in
it
xtianity
certainly
does
not
have
a
monopoly
on
principles
of
behavior
indeed
fewer

are
guiltier
of
violating
their

yes
if

nature

there

no

actually

whats
your
point
hudson
if
humans
are
made

then
choices
are
also
chemical

so
why
is
choice
an
important

if

mr

the
following
as
part

a
book
review
section
in

peoples

spring
edition
i
conclude
with
a
little
sermon
because
i
believe
we
will
not
be
a
mormon
or
humanfamily
until
we
can
get
over
labeling
and
rejecting
each
other
with
terms
like
feminist
or
patriarchal
liberal
or
conservative
christian
or
nonchristian
hal
when
we
are
tempted
to
draw
a
circle
around
a
set
of
beliefs
and
traditions
and
styles
and
call
it
american
then
exclude
those
who
dont
fit
it
may
be
well
to
consider
that
perhaps
the
most
central
defining
characteristic
of
a
good
american
might
be
one
who
doesnt
draw
exclusive
circles
that
the
surest
way
of
excluding
ourselves
from
the
central
american
ideal
is
by
excluding
others
and
when
we
are
tempted
to
draw
a
circle
around
mormon
or
christian
to
decide
who
is
orthodox
and
who
isnt
by
how
much
they
agree
with
us
it
might
be
well
to
consider
that
the
central
pillar
of
christs
orthodoxy
is
our
ability
to
love
unconditionally
those
who
are
different
and
include
them
in
our
family
i
recently
spent
some
time
in
a
christian
bookstore
in
california
the
service
was
excellent
the
clerks
and
customers
all
smiling
neat
and
wellscrubbed
and
there
were
the
expected
wholesome
offerings
of
scriptural
commentaries
sentimental
fiction
and
collections
of
evangelistic
sermons
but
i
was
dismayed
to
find
how
much
shelf
space
was
given
to
attacking
others
often
viciouslywhether
the
political
left
our
modern
american
culture
or
other
religions
a
whole
section
was
devoted
to
cults
and
the
occult
and
as
you
might
expect
mormonism
was
right
there
under
the
same
rubric
and
indictment
often
by
the
same
authors
as
satanism
and
i
found
i
could
either
rent
or
buy
in
english
or
spanish
copies
of
the
god
makers
that
absurdly
inaccurate
even
libelous
but
very
popular
and
dangerous
antimormon
film
that
uses
exaclty
the
same
techniques
and
even
accusations
of
the
nazi
films
that
scapegoated
jews
in
the
it
seems
to
me
one
major
indication
that
a
person
is
a
genuine
convert
to
christ
and
his
redemptive
love
is
his
lack
of
paranoia
and
anxiety
perfect
love

i
john
i
have
always
been
pleased
that

i
find

increase

willingness

right

this

styles
they
dont

a
fearful
irony

in

doing

take
common
cause

the
very
people
who
have
most
slanderously
attacked

for

my

of

have
a

and
implication
than
mainstream
christianity
would
give
it
it
isnt
so
much
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
bible
texts
that
sets
mormonism
apart
from
orthodoxy
as
it
is
a
matter
of
fabrication
about
years
ago
national
lampoon
had
some
comic
strips
in
them
that
were
drawn
by
neal
adams
they
were
called
son
o
god
comics
it
was
a
parody
of
the
jesus
in
the
bible
in
the
comic
there
were
a
group
of
thirteen
jewish
kids
from
brooklyn
and
when
one
of
them
said
the
magic
word
he
turned
into
son
o
god
he
went
from
a
myopic
curly
headed
yarmulke
wearing
boy
to
a
replica
of
the
stylizied
portraits
of
jesus
with
long
flowing
brown
hair
and
gentile
features
now
if
someone
were
to
profess
faith
in
this
natlamp
jesus
and
claim
that
they
were
a
christian
because
they
believed
in
this
natlamp
jesus
we
would
have
to
say
that
this
was
fallacious
since
this
jesus
was
a
fabrication
and
did
not
really
exist
this
is
the
exact
same
thing
that
the
lds
do
when
they
claim
that
they
are
christian
they
profess
faith
in
jesus
but
the
jesus
that
they
profess
to
have
faith
in
is
as
much
a
fabrication
as

i
was
not
directly
going
to
come
up
with
a
moral
argument
for
the
existence
of

rather
i
was
trying
to
show
the
absurdity
of
atheistic
materialist
relatavists
trying
to
embrace
some
common
moral
system
as
though
it
were
absolute
man
knows
in
his
heart
that
there
is
right
and
wrong
we
have
all
inherited
this
knowledge
no
matter
how
absurd
it
is
to
suggest
that
a
common
moral
system
created
by
mankind
is
absolute
it
is
not
contrary
to
reason
to
suggest
that
a
common
moral
system
created
by
mankind
is
sensible
in
fact
for
the
bible
to
be
of
any
use
to
mankind
as
a
moral
code
it
must
be
interpreted
by
mankind
and
a
workable
moral
system
created
for
everyday
use
the
jewish
talmud
is
the
result
of
centuries
of
biblical
scholars
analysing
every
word
of
the
torah
to
understand
the
morality
behind
it
the
children
of
israel
were
given
a
very
strict
set
of
moral
civil
judicial
and
ceremonial
laws
to
follow
and
yet
this
was
clearly
not
enough
to
cover
every
instance
of
moral
dilemma
in
their
society
for
a
christian
the
situation
is
no
better
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
code
of
morality
that
we
have
from
the
judeo
christian
god
is
that
which
is
contained
in
the
bible
which
we
can
see
from
the
diverse
opinions
in
the
christian
newsgroups
is
not
clear
there
may
well
be
an
absolute
morality
defined
by
the
judeochristian
god
for
mankind
to
follow
but
it
seems
that
we
only
have
a
subset
simply
because
the
concept
was
written
down
by
man
this
leads
to
the
problem
of
defining
morality
for
our
society
if
we
take
the
divine
morality
then
we
have
a
code
of
practice
which
may
be
interpreted
in
many
different
ways
as
an
example
consider
the
immolation
of
heretics
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
interpretation
of
the
bible
which
allows
a
man
to
do
that
to
another
man
under
the
precept
to
administer
justice
if
we
take
an
agnostic
morality
then
we
have
a
code
of
practice
that
can
be
modified
to
suit
society
with
all
the
danger
that
this
implies
alternatively
we
could
take
the
basis
of
the
judeochristian
morality
and
interpretextend
this
to
create
and
justify
a
code
of
morality
which
suits
the
society
we
live
in
and
enables
the
people
to
live
righteously
as
many
christian
and
nonchristian
philosophers
have
done
whatever
the
driving
force
behind
the
definition
of
morality
for
our
society
i
think
the
important
aspect
is
the
result

fragmentation
the
primary
problem
in
human
nature
is
a
fragmentation
of
being
humans
are
in
a
state
of
tension
a
tension
of
opposites
good
and
evil
are
the
most
thought
provoking
polarities
that
come
to
mind
the
bible
provides
us
with
many
examples
of
the
fragmentation
of
being
the
warring
opposites
within
us
are
a
product
of
mans
rebellion
against
god
which
is
described
so
vividly
in
the
pages
of
the
scriptures
man
was
created
with
the
order
to
become
a
god
those
were
the
words
of
st
basil
in
the
fourth
century
what
he
was
trying
to
say
was
that
god
created
man
to
be
a
partaker
of
the
divine
nature
in
the
eastern
orthodox
church
this
is
called
theosis
or
deification
one
can
also
say
that
man
was
created
to
be
whole
ie
spirit
soul
and
body
operating
in
unison
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
is
a
picture
of
the
archetypal
humans
before
obtaining
moral
consciousness
theirs
was
a
harmonious
relationship
with
each
other
the
world
and
the
creator
that
innocent
harmony
was
shattered
when
they
disobeyed
god
their
natural
wholeness
falling
apart
into
two
seemingly
irreconcilable
halves
immediately
guilt
and
fear
was
manifested
in
their
lives
they
become
bound
to
hardship
toil
and
suffering
this
is
symbolized
in
their
exile
from
the
paradisiac
state
the
beast
in
the
jungle
does
not
possess
moral
consciousness
if
it
were
to
receive
this
selfawareness
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
its
paradisiac
state
would
also
be
destroyed
was
it
the
intention
of
the
creator
to
leave
man
in
this
state
of
innocence
all
the
days
of
his
existence
on
earth
or
was
the
gaining
of
selfawareness
carefully
staged
by
god
who
did
not
desire
that
his
masterpiece
mankind
be
a
blissful
idiot
god
must
have
known
that
for
mankind
to
achieve
any
kind
of
moral
value
he
must
pass
through
a
confrontation
with
the
opposites
there
is
no
other
way
to
achieve
union
with
god
jesus
christ
is
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
the
warring
polarities
he
was
the
perfectly
integrated
individual
reconciling
the
opposites
and
making
it
possible
for
us
to
be
integrated
ie
to
become
god
not
in
his
essence
but
in
his
energies
the
opposites
is
the
christian
problem

apostle

mr

you
said

these

im

its

thus
i
apologize
for
thinking
that
even
mr

could
find
such

convincinghe
should
specify
which
parts
of
bullinger
he
finds
convincing
and
quit
hiding
behind
a
disingenuous
mask
of
this
is
what
bullinger
believed
not

what
i
believe
so
which
is
it
mr
decenso
do
you
find
the
exegisis
convincing
or
not
my
reply
one
of
my
purposes
in
debating
these
alleged
contradictions
with
you
and
others
is
to
diseminate
many
different
views
of
possible
reconciliations
raised
by
various
bible
scholars
and
students
alike
when
i
present
my
views
i
will
clearly
distinguish
them
from
now
on
db
of
course
without
archer
and
bullinger
we
find
that
mr
decenso
has
presented
no
greek
exegisis
at
all
and
mr
decenso
has
made
a
big
thing
about
my
not
referring
back
to
the
actual
greek
thus
we
find
this
demand
on
his
part
for
quality
greek
exegisis
to
be
a
hypocritical
requirement
my
reply
good
point
but
in
your
declaring
that
these
passages
are
contradictory
you
have
produced
only
superficial
reasonings
and
observations
nor
have
you
dug
deeper
im
glad
you
have
begun
in
this
post
i
will
begin
greek
studies
on
these
passages
in
more
depth
than
i
thought
necessary
as
well
db
it
would
be
appropriate
to
look
at
what
mr
decenso
has
actually
used
as
evidence
now
we
know
what
he
claims
for
a
standard
as
he
has
stated
it
often
enough
a
the
text
itself
b
parallel
passages
c
other
pertinent
scriptures
d
historical
context
e
historical
content
f
other
pertinent
historical
info
g
cultural
context
h
cultural
content
i
other
pertinent
cultural
info
j
grammatical
construction
k
hebrew
and
greek
word
studies
l
etc
but
are
these
actual
standards
he
has
used
or
simply
empty
hyperbole
lets
see
he
has
used
a
and
since
he
is
trying
to
reconcile
it
to
other
passages
we
see
that
he
has
also
used
b
on
the
other
hand
he
has
presented
no
use
of
d
historical
context
or
e
historical
content
or
f
other
pertinent
historical
info
or
g
cultural
context
or
h
cultural
content
or
i
other
pertinent
cultural
info
or
j
grammatical
construction
or
even
k
hebrew
and
greek
word
studies
remember
archer
and
bullinger
dont
count
thus
we
find
his
vaunted
criteria
for
exegisis
is
just
empty
mouthings
my
reply
question
do
you
find
such
criteria
important
if
so
do
you
plan
on
starting
to
use
them
to
the
best
of
your
ability
or
will
you
continue
to
present
shallow
observations
i
dont
mean
this
in
a
bad
way
at
this
point
in
our
debates
i
have
not
found
it
necessary
to
present
a
total
exegetical
analysis
of
these
passages
since
we
seem
to
keep
beating
around
the
bush
and
not
getting
into
the
core
of
the
verses
i
do
not
believe
it
necessary
to
use
many
of
the
above
criteria
to
refute
your
arguments
re
judas
in
acts
and
matthew
but
i
will
do
my
best
from
this
point
on
to
use
several
of
the
above
criteria
since
you
desire
me
to
i
hope
you
will
also
it
will
greatly
enhance
our
study
of
these
passages
db
the
only
thing
he
has
actually
used
beyond
the
passage
itself
is
any
other
passage
thus
mr
decenso
should
be
honest
and
note
that
most
of
his
list
is
red
herring
and
his
only
real
criteria
seems
to
be
a
the
text
itself
b
parallel
passages
my
reply
the
reason
is
simpleyou
are
mistating
the
passages
you
claim
that
the
passages
contradict
one
another
i
do
not
see
the
passages
contradicting
one
another
they
may
very
well
be
complimentary
as
many
scholarly
sources
mention
matthew
may
not
be
presenting
judas
death
as
you
claim
but
well
look
at
your
defense
of
this
later
also
the
reward
of
iniquity
in
the
acts
passage
may
not
be
the
pieces
of
silver
in
matthews
passages
although
you
have
a
valiant
attempt
later
at
stating
why
you
believe
it
is
at
this
beginning
stages
in
our
debates
we
are
laying
some
scriptural
groundwork
which
will
be
expanded
upon
through
deeper
exegesis
db
of
course
the
only
reason
i
can
see
to
so
drastically
reinterpret
a
passage
as
he
has
done
with
judas
death
is
to
make
it
agree
with
another
passage
so
that
both
could
be
considered
correct
my
reply
one
of
the
reasons
i
have
given
a
different
exegetical
view
of
the
passages
is
that
you
seem
to
think
the
majority
of
scholarship
is
wrong
in
concluding
these
passages
are
complimentary
however
i
see
no
problem
in
tony
roses
explanation
of
judas
death
how
would
you
explain
the
inaccuracy
between
judas
hanging
himself
in
matthew
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
this
question
of
the
manner
in
which
judas
died
is
one
with
which
we
are
constantly
confronted
in
our
travels
many
people
point
to
the
apparent
discrepancy
in
the
two
accounts
as
an
obvious
irreconcilable
error
some
have
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
idea
of
an
inerrant
bible
is
destroyed
by
these
contradictory
accounts
however
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
matthew
relates
that
judas
hanged
himself
while
peter
tells
us
he
fell
and
was
crushed
by
the
impact
the
two
statements
are
indeed
different
but
do
they
necessarily
contradict
each
other
matthew
does
not
say
that
judas
did
not
fall
neither
does
peter
say
that
judas
did
not
hang
himself
this
is
not
a
matter
of
one
person
calling
something
black
and
the
other
person
calling
it
white
both
accounts
can
be
true
and
supplementary
a
possible
reconstruction
would
be
this
judas
hanged
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
overlooked
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snapped
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
judas
fell
down
the
ledge
mangling
his
body
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
before
or
after
death
as
either
would
fit
this
explanation
this
possibility
is
entirely
natural
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examined
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocky
terraces
to
feet
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
are
not
told
how
long
judas
remained
hanging
from
the
tree
or
how
advanced
was
the
decomposition
of
his
body
before
his
fall
louis
gaussen
relates
a
story
of
a
man
who
was
determined
to
kill
himself
this
individual
placed
himself
on
the
sill
of
a
high
window
and
pointed
a
pistol
at
his
head
he
then
pulled
the
trigger
and
leaped
from
the
window
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
hand
a
person
could
say
that
this
man
took
his
life
by
shooting
himself
while
another
could
rightly
contend
he
committed
suicide
by
jumping
form
the
tall
building
in
this
case
both
are
true
as
both
are
true
in
the
case
of
matthews
and
peters
accounts
of
the
death
of
judas
it
is
merely
a
situation
of
different
perspectives
of
the
same
event
your
only
reason
for
rejecting
this
is
i
believe
your
attempt
to
discredit
inerrancy
you
havent
related
how
this
is
impossible
or
highly
unlikely
heres
what
you
said
in
an
earlier
post
db
quoting
tony
rose
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
it
is
important
to
remember
that
we
are
not
told
how
long
judas
remained
hanging
from
the
tree
or
how
advanced
was
the
decomposition
of
his
body
before
his
fall
the
added
text
in
this
version
is
so
heavy
that
assuming
you
are
truly
so
opposed
to
such
tactics
you
should
find
it
not
credible
but
you
seem
to
find
tony
roses
eisegesis
satisfactory
while
clearly
rejecting
david
joslins
here
you
discredit
tonys
explanation
based
on
what
you
deem
too
heavy
for
the
passages
but
you
havent
addressed
why
you
feel
that
way
you
can
say
its
a
vain
attempt
to
reconcile
the
contradiction
but
that
doesnt
tell
me
it
didnt
happen
nor
have
you
shown
why
you
reject
that
possibility
questions
is
matthew
lying
or
is
luke
lying
or
are
they
both
lying
or
are
either
or
both
of
them
misinformed
why
do
you
think
there
is
such
an
alleged
contradiction
i
do
not
think
you
have
ever
told
us
what
you
believe
in
this
respect
db
at
present
though
mr
decenso
only
asks
two
questions
of
me
you
claim
acts
and
matthew
contradict
one
another
in
representing
judas
death
i
ask
you
again
to
provide
evidence
that
matthew
stated
judas
died
in
the
hanging
you
claim
that
the
pieces
of
silver
in
matthew
that
judas
threw
down
in
the
temple
and
the
chief
priests
used
is
the
reward
of
iniquity
in
acts
that
pictures
judas
in
some
way
purchasing
a
field
with
therefore
there
is
a
contradiction
prove
that
the
pieces
of
silver
and
the
reward
of
iniquity
are
one
and
the
same
actually
i
find
question
to
be
a
rather
stupid
request
but
i
will
answer
it
because
he
now
restricts
himself
to
two
points
first
i
would
point
out
that
hanging
is
a
very
efficient
manner
for
ending
a
life
in
fact
it
is
a
bit
of
a
fluke
when
someone
survives
hanging
except
in
fantasy
cowboy
movies
and
even
then
it
usually
referred
to
as
an
attempted
hanging
my
reply
i
work
at
an
agency
that
investigates
child
abuse
and
neglect
today
i
got
a
call
re
a
child
that
attempted
suicide
by
hanging
himself
because
his
mother
is
on
crack
he
failed
in
his
attempt
and
is
in
a
childs
psych
ward
at
a
local
hospital
hanging
attempts
are
not
always
successful
to
assume
that
because
most
hangings
are
successful
this
one
was
also
is
begging
the
question
if
i
may
quote
you
last
night
listening
to
the
bible
answer
man
broadcast
the
christian
research
institutes
show
one
of
the
scholars
on
there
used
several
of
these
terms
that
you
use
i
am
not
all
that
familiar
with
them
the
man
on
the
bam
show
teaches
comparative
religion
and
logic
it
was
interesting
db
this
is
so
prevalent
that
so
that
to
say
a
man
hung
himself
with
no
other
qualifiers
is
synonymous
with
stating
that
he
killed
himself
my
reply
qualifiers
are
important
at
times
as
well
see
in
an
ot
passage
ill
mention
below
does
hanging
always
have
this
outcome
did
matthew
who
is
the
only
source
we
have
re
judas
hanging
himself
state
that
judas
died
as
a
result
to
say
its
synonymous
means
it
has
the
same
meaning
as
a
boy
age
hung
himself
but
he
lived
this
is
only
one
of
probably
thousands
of
documented
cases
we
can
discover
db
now
i
am
not
alone
in
this
thought
in
fact
since
mr
decenso
so
respects
christian
scholarly
including
greek
scholars
opinion
i
did
some
research
my
reply
thank
you
dave
db
interestingly
not
one
of
the
christian
references
i
read
interpreted
the
hanging
as
being
anything
but
a
fatal
suicide
my
reply
above
mine
so
its
ok
to
use
christian
sources
to
back
your
points
what
about
tonys
position
do
you
value
it
or
even
consider
it
as
a
valid
possibility
also
is
it
possible
that
the
sources
you
read
may
be
wrong
or
lying
or
deceived
in
other
parts
of
their
books
if
so
should
we
do
as
we
have
done
with
archer
toss
them
to
the
side
and
not
value
anything
they
say
including
their
interpretation
of
the
hanging
of
judas
i
am
sure
you
would
find
some
errors
and
maybe
even
some
deception
in
those
sources
you
also
noted
they
interpreted
the
hanging
as
meaning
he
died
although
that
is
very
possibly
true
do
you
find
that
in
the
text
itself
remember
thats
the
first
criteria
we
must
examine
db
this
included
the
biblical
knowledge
commentary
by
woodward
and
zuck
my
reply
which
i
own
its
a
good
source
of
commentary
info
but
not
inerrant
db
the
interpreters
on
volume
commentary
on
the
bible
by
laydon
the
one
volume

commentary
by

r

word
meanings
of
the

ralph
earl
the
abingdon
bible
commentary
published
by
abingdon
harpers
bible
commentary
by
william
neal
actually
i
could
have
presented
many
more
as
well
my
reply
i
appreciate
your
doing
this
research
dave
maybe
we
are
getting
somewhere
in
how
we
both
should
approach
these
alleged
contradictions
more
in
depth
study
db
in
each
case
these
references
specifically
describe
that
the
interpretation
of
matt
as
successful
suicide
and
thus
i
can
only
conclude
that
the
greek
word
apagchwie
hang
oneself
is
translated
as
a
successful
hanging
my
reply
above
mine
no
you
cant
only
conclude
this
although
as
tony
says
this
was
a
highly
probable
outcome
but
matthew
does
not
state
death
as
being
a
result
the
greek
word
is
apagcho
matthew
is
its
only
occurrence
in
the
new
testament
in
the
septuagint
the
greek
translation
of
the
ot
used
at
the
time
of
jesus
its
only
used
in
samuel
now
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
advice
was
not
followed
he
saddled
a
donkey
and
arose
and
went
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
then
he
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
he
was
buried
in
his
fathers
tomb
notice
that
not
only
is
it
stated
that
ahithophel
hanged
himself
gr
sept
apagcho
but
it
explicitly
adds
and
died
here
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
result
in
matthew
we
are
not
explicitly
told
judas
died
also
there
is
nothing
in
the
greek
to
suggest
success
or
failure
it
simply
means
hang
oneself
db
but
mr
decenso
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
disagree
and
show
more
reputable
christian
scholars
that
insist
that
the
hanging
was
not
successful
my
reply
above
mine
reputable
you
mean
ones
that
have
never
erred
as
far
as
insisting
that
the
hanging
was
unsuccessful
that
cant
be
done
even
by
me
as
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
although
i
still
agree
with
tonys
exegesis
as
being
the
most
probable
explanation
regarding
judas
death
taking
into
account
several
criteria
ive
recently
noticed
some
new
things
in
matthew
mat
then
he
threw
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
but
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
they
are
the
price
of
blood
and
they
consulted
together
and
bought
with
them
the
potters
field
to
bury
strangers
in
therefore
that
field
has
been
called
the
field
of
blood
to
this
day
first
of
all
notice
that
the
text
does
not
say
that
judas
died
as
a
result
of
hanging
all
it
says
is
that
he
went
and
hanged
himself
luke
however
in
acts
tells
us
that
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
this
is
a
pretty
clear
indication
along
with
the
other
details
given
in
acts
peters
speech
the
need
to
pick
a
new
apostle
etc
that
at
least
after
judas
fall
he
was
dead
so
the
whole
concept
that
matthew
and
luke
both
recount
judas
death
is
highly
probable
but
not
clear
cut
i
also
wrote
my
reply
here
we
have
a
stickler
dave
that
i
have
to
say
i
just
recently
noticed
lets
look
at
the
passage
in
matthew
mat
saying
i
have
sinned
by
betraying
innocent
blood
and
they
said
what
is
that
to
us
you
see
to
it
mat
then
he
threw
down
the
pieces
of
silver
in
the
temple
and
departed
and
went
and
hanged
himself
mat
but
the
chief
priests
took
the
silver
pieces
and
said
it
is
not
lawful
to
put
them
into
the
treasury
because
they
are
the
price
of
blood
mat
and
they
consulted
together
and
bought
with
them
the
potters
field
to
bury
strangers
in
mat
therefore
that
field
has
been
called
the
field
of
blood
to
this
day
notice
verse
hewent
and
hanged
himself
matthew
does
not
say
judas
died
does
it
should
we
assume
he
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
what
does
acts
say
act
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
wages
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
act
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
dwelling
place
be
desolate
and
let
no
one
live
in
it
and
let
another
take
his
office
here
we
may
have
a
graphic
explanation
of
judas
deathso
my
line
of
reasoning
to
dispel
your
contradiction
myth
rethe
two
accounts
of
judas
death
is
thismatthew
doesnt
necessarily
explain
how
judas
died
he
does
say
judas
hanged
himself
but
he
didnt
specifically
say
judas
died
in
the
hanging
incident
however
acts
seems
to
show
us
his
graphic
demise
therefore
there
is
no
contradiction
between
matthew
and
acts
re
judas
death
my
reply
we
do
know
from
matthew
that
he
did
hang
himself
and
acts
probably
records
his
death
although
its
possible
and
plausible
that
he
fell
from
the
hanging
and
hit
some
rocks
thereby
bursting
open
i
can
no
longer
assume
that
to
be
the
case
therefore
no
contradiction
matthew
did
not
say
judas
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
did
he
most
scholars
believe
he
probably
did
but
i
quoted
all
that
to
show
that
i
highly
regard
the
scholars
explanations
but
in
looking
at
the
texts
initially
we
cant
assume
judas
died
it
is
however
highly
probable
db
by
the
way
while
all
agree
that
judas
died
from
the
hanging
the
books
had
different
ways
of
dealing
with
the
contradiction
we
are
discussing
one
simply
ignored
it
entirely
and
simply
referred
back
to
matthews
version
as
the
correct
version
in
both
matt
and
acts
the
biblical
knowledge
commentary
suggested
the
hypotheses
that
judas
hung
and
then
when
he
rotted
his
belly
exploded
which
doesnt
explain
his
headlong
fall
or
that
his
branch
or
rope
broke
and
he
fell
to
his
death
and
his
gut
gushed
out
which
doesnt
explain
how
a
hanging
man
would
fall
headlong
rather
than
feet
first
my
reply
the
outcome
of
any
fall
is
dependent
upon
many
factorshow
high
the
person
was
suspended
before
the
fall
any
obstructions
such
as
tree
branches
that
may
have
deviated
the
fall
how
steep
an
incline
of
rocky
surfaces
the
victim
fell
upon
thus
possibly
rolling
or
bouncing
of
several
rocks
etc
in
a
superficial
examination
of
the
acts
passage
and
the
matthew
passage
we
are
not
given
a
lot
of
info
on
the
geographical
specifics
but
tony
in
the
above
quoted
post
gave
us
some
a
possible
reconstruction
would
be
this
judas
hanged
himself
on
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
overlooked
the
valley
of
hinnom
after
he
hung
there
for
some
time
the
limb
of
the
tree
snapped
or
the
rope
gave
way
and
judas
fell
down
the
ledge
mangling
his
body
in
the
process
the
fall
could
have
been
before
or
after
death
as
either
would
fit
this
explanation
this
possibility
is
entirely
natural
when
the
terrain
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
examined
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
you
can
see
rocky
terraces
to
feet
in
height
and
almost
perpendicular
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
therefore
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
judas
struck
one
of
the
jagged
rocks
on
this
way
down
tearing
his
body
open
db
now
truthfully
i
do
not
see
what
is
comforting
about
matthew
confusing
the
source
of
the
potters
field
prophesy
but
on
the
other
hand
the
author
is
correct
matthew
does
make
that
confusion
of
course
a
biblical
inerrantist
who
claim
that
every
word
of
the
bible
is
guaranteed
true
by
god
will
have
to
thereby
add
one
more
contradiction
to
the
death
of
judas
ie
where
the
prophesy
of
the
potters
field
came
from
my
reply
please
when
we
are
done
with
this
study
on
his
death
remind
me
to
discuss
this
with
you
db
as
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
judas
purchased
the
land
was
indeed
for
the
betrayal
rather
than
some
other
source
i
would
point
out
that
in
acts
where
it
specifically
mention
the
reward
of
iniquity
acts
it
also
specifically
mentions
what
act
of
iniquity
they
were
talking
about
ie
acts
concerning
judas
who
was
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bible
describes
an
act
of
iniquity
and
then
immediately
discusses
the
reward
of
iniquity
it
would
be
rather
inane
to
suggest
that
it
was
an
action
of
iniquity
other
than
the
one
discussed
my
reply
dave
we
are
getting
somewhere
arent
we
act
and
in
those
days
peter
stood
up
in
the
midst
of
the
disciples
altogether
the
number
of
names
was
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
said
act
men
and
brethren
this
scripture
had
to
be
fulfilled
which
the
holy
spirit
spoke
before
by
the
mouth
of
david
concerning
judas
who
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
act
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
act
now
this
man
purchased
a
field
with
the
wages
of
iniquity
and
falling
headlong
he
burst
open
in
the
middle
and
all
his
entrails
gushed
out
act
and
it
became
known
to
all
those
dwelling
in
jerusalem
so
that
field
is
called
in
their
own
language
akel
dama
that
is
field
of
blood
act
for
it
is
written
in
the
book
of
psalms
let
his
dwelling
place
be
desolate
and
let
no
one
live
in
it
and
let
another
take
his
office
notice
that
in
verse
the
word
iniquity
is
not
used
rather
it
states
that
judas
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therevs
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
what
part
did
judas
play
in
their
ministry
joh
this
he
said
not
that
he
cared
for
the
poor
but
because
he
was
a
thief
and
had
the
money
box
and
he
used
to
take
what
was
put
in
it
joh
for
some
thought
because
judas
had
the
money
box
that
jesus
had
said
to
him
buy
those
things
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
so
now
we
know
what
part
judas
played
he
was
a
treasurer
per
se
right
after
peter
stated
that
judas
played
a
part
in
this
ministry
treasurer
according
to
john
then
luke
adds
the
parenthetical
explanation
of
wages
of
iniquity
money
that
should
have
been
put
into
the
ministry
but
was
stolen
by
judas
to
purchase
a
field
i
believe
this
is
a
better
exegetical
explanation
of
what
the
wages
of
iniquity
are
what
do
you
think
dave
db
now
since
i
have
given
you
clear
answers
and
even
references
perhaps
you
could
unequivocally
state
what
type
of
inerrantist
you
are
instead
of
asking
me
what
type
i
think
you
are
as
you
did
to
mr
joslin
my
reply
i
will
gladly
admit
that
i
am
a
complete
inerrantist
although
i
do
not
have
that
big
a
problem
with
the
limited
inerrancy
view

one
wished
to
contend
with

produced

last

about
chorion
by
the
way
mr
decenso
you
really
should
have
looked
in
the
index
of
your
bauerarndtgingrich
greek
lexicon
you
would
have
found
that
the
word
in
acts
for
lot
is
kleros
not
chorion
as
stated
by
mr
archer
and
nowhere
in
the
very
large
discussion
of
kleros
in
done
the
to
theological
dictionary
of
the
new
testament
by
bromley
is
the
meaning
burial
plot
discussed
it
discusses
the
forms
of
kleros
eg
kleros
kleroo
etc
and
the
various
meanings
of
kleros
eg
plot
of
land
and
inheritance
but
mentions
nothing
about
chorion
or
burial
plot
why
does
this
not
surprise
me
thus
it
would
seem
to
be
a
very
good
thing
you
dumped
archer
as
a
reference
i
was
wrong
i
admit
that
i
do
not
have
a
handle
on
greek
grammar
and
thus
confused
kleros
the
second
to
last
word
in
acts
as
being
the
plot
of
land
discussed
in
actuality
it
is
chorion
which
is
the
last
word
acts
unfortunately
my
greek
dictionary
does
not
discuss
chorion
so
i
cannot
report
as
to
the
nuances
of
the
word
i
abhor
publishing
trash
i
abhor
it
of
myself
even
more
than
i
do
from
others
but
since
i
do
not
present
myself
as
an
authority
on
the
subject
i
do
not
feel
dishonest
though
i
do
openly
admit
ignorance
and
incompetence
in
this
example
thus
i
felt
honor
bound
to
do
a
better
set
of
research
specifically
on
the
word
first
it
should
be
noted
that
greek
grammar
is
not
as
tough
as
i
first
assumed
it
is
not
nontrivial
by
any
means
and
i
still
am
not
competent
with
it
but
it
is
not
as
opaque
as
i
had
thought
it
turns
out
that
while
the
index
for
the
bauerarndtgingrich
greek
lexicon
renders
each
verse
in
order
each
word
within
a
verse
is
put
in
greek
alphabetical
order
thus
while
the
the
meaning
of
the
verse
is
decipherable
the
syntax
is
far
from
clear
on
the
other
hand
a
greekenglish
intralinear
bible
makes
things
a
lot
more
comprehendable
and
yes
the
word
for
field
in
acts
is
indeed
chorion
now
ive
checked
several
greekenglish
lexicons
greek
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
louw
and
nida
robinsons
greek
and
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
greek
english

the

grimm
word
study
concordance
tynsdale
a
greek
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
and
other
early
christian
writings
bauerarndtgingrich
the
new
analytical
greek
lexicon
perschbacher
in
each
case
the
meaning
of
the
word
chorion
was
given
variously
as
a
space
place
region
district
field
area
country
place
land
farm
estate
a
bit
of
tillage
and
similar
meanings
nowhere
do
any
of
these
books
mention
anything
about
grave
as
some
of
these
books
go
into
great
detail
i
would
be
very
surprised
to
find
that
these
books
are
all
inadequate
and
mr
archer
is
the
only
competent
scholar
in
greek
i
think
it
more
likely
that
mr
archers
investigations
into
contradictions
to
be
once
again
as
your
friend
said
it
lacking
in
substance
and
thus
archer
is
again
shown
worthless
as
an
expert
witness
by
the
way
mr
decenso
i
would
have
honorably
presented
my
results
on
this
matter
even
if
i
had
found
them
to
support
mr
archers
contentions
by
the
way
among
these
lexicons
eg
robinsons
is
the
definition
of
agros
the
word
used
in
matthew
to
describe
the
field
bought
the
word
agros
is
defined
as
a
field
in
the
country
chorion
is
specifically
noted
as
a
synonym
to
agros
this
is
significant
as
it
is
evidence
of
how
silly
bullingers
exegisis
was
which
stated
that
the
word
for
field
in
matthew
ie
agros
is
different
from
the
word
for
field
in
acts
ie
chorion
and
thus
we
must
be
talking
about
two
different
fields
of
course
you
already
admit
how
stupid
bullingers
exegisis
is
but
this
was
a
small
serendipity
which
drives
the
point
home
so
as
of
now
unless
mr
decenso
show
compelling
reasons
to
believe
otherwise
eg
a
reputable
scholar
with
reputable
references
i
consider
this
particular
issue
closed
see
mr
decenso
now
you
can
go
on
to
answer
questions
about
the
denials
of
peter
the
day
of
the
crucifixion
tyre
and
the
fact
that
the
author
of
matthew
quoted
from
the
wrong
prophet
in
discussing
the
potters
field
later
dave
butler
precise
knowledge
is
the
only
true
knowledge
and
he
who
does
not

does
not
teach

still

mr

in
spite
of
requiring
scholarly
opinion
on
the
hanging
of
judas
rejects
that
the
scholarly
opinion
of
the
those
scholars
and
then
rephrases
those
scholars
opinion
on
the
subject
we
do
know
from
matthew
that
he
did
hang
himself
and
acts
probably
records
his
death
although
its
possible
and
plausible
that
he
fell
from
the
hanging
and
hit
some
rocks
thereby
bursting
open
i
can
no
longer
assume
that
to
be
the
case
therefore
no
contradiction
matthew
did
not
say
judas
died
as
a
result
of
the
hanging
did
he
most
scholars
believe
he
iprobably
did
but
i
quoted
all
that
to
show
that
i
highly
regard
the
scholars
explanations
but
in
looking
at
the
texts
initially
we
cant
assume
judas
died
it
is
however
highly
probable
and
also
there
is
nothing
in
the
greek
to
suggest
success
or
failure
it
simply
means
hang
oneself
actually
if
you
do
further
research
as
to
the
greek
word
apacgw
you
will
find
that
it
does
denote
success
those
scholars
did
indeed
have
an
excellent
reason
to
assume
that
the
suicide
was
successful
as
i
pointed
out
i
recently
checked
several
lexicons
greek
english

of
the
new

a

simply
stated
hanged
oneself
and
a
couple
were
more
explicit
and
stated
that
apacgw
means
specifically
kill
yourself
by
hanging
a
couple
also
noted
that
the
meaning
of
one
the
root
words
for
apacgw
is
strangle
throttle
or
choke
which
pretty
much
invalidates
the
guy
who
suggested
to
david
joslin
that
judas
was
hung
upside
down
one
of
the
best
references
though
robinsons
greek
and
english
lexicon
of
the
new
testament
not
only
stated
the
translation
it
gave
both
the
root
words
the
literal
translation
related
greek
words
which
use
the
same
roots
and
also
other
presented
specific
examples
of
the
word
in
greek
literature
to
give
further
context
the
word
apagchw
has
two
root
words
gchw
is
the
to
strangle
root
and
the
root
word
apo
means
literally
away
this
root
words
is
included
in
words
which
denote
a
transition
it
can
mean
a
transition
in
place
eg
the
greek
word
apagello
means
to
send
a
message
apo
can
also
denote
a
change
in
state
and
specifically
the
change
from
life
to
death
robinson
specifically
makes
comparison
to
the
word
apokteiuo
which
means
to
kill
in
literal
meaning
the
word
apacgw
means
to
throttle
strangle
to
put
out
of
the
way
and
implicitly
denotes
a
change
in
life
state
ie
away
from
life
to
death
so
while
the
word
apacgw
does
mean
to
hang
it
specifically
denotes
a
death
as
well
thus
robinson
is
quite
specific
when
he
state
that
it
means
to
hang
oneself
to
end
ones
life
by
hanging
he
then
notes
the
the
use
of
apacgw
in
homers
odessy
to
denote
context
he
presents
that
example
of
apacgw
as
being
used
to
explicitly
mean
suicide
by
hanging
now
since
there
is
a
perfectly
good
word
for
strangling
without
the
added
denotation
of
death
and
as
you
insist
that
the
bible
was
written
by
god
and
every
word
is
precicely
correct
you
are
stuck
with
the
complete
meaning
of
apacgw
ie
since
the
word
apacgw
was
used
then
death
is
denoted
as
the
result
by
the
way
i
note
that
mr
decenso
also
presents
an
example
of
apacgw
in
the
septuagint
the
greek
translation
of
the
ot
used
at
the
time
of
jesus
its
only
used
in
samuel
now
when
ahithophel
saw
that
his
advice
was
not
followed
he
saddled
a
donkey
and
arose
and
went
home
to
his
house
to
his
city
then
he
put
his
household
in
order
and
hanged
himself
and
died
and
he
was
buried
in
his
fathers
tomb
notice
that
not
only
is
it
stated
that
ahithophel
hanged
himself
gr
sept
apagcho
but
it
explicitly
adds
and
died
here
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
result
in
matthew
we
are
not
explicitly
told
judas
died
note
mr
decenso
as
you
say
the
septuagint
was
a
translation
from
hebrew
to
greek
and
you
have
not
shown
the
original
meaning
of
the
hebrew
ie
the
the
hebrew
say
and
died
and
thus
whether
it
was
simply
echoed
in
the
greek
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
regardless
of
the
added
and
died
the
correct
translation
would
still
be
apacgw
as
the
man
did
indeed
die
from
strangulation
redundant
but
correct
further
we
have
evidence
that
the
septuagint
was
repeatedly
rewritten
and
reedited
which
included
versions
which
contradicted
each
other
and
such
editing
was
not
even
necessarily
executed
by
greeks
thus
i
am
not
sure
that
you
can
use
the
septuagint
as
it
now
stands
as
a
paragon
of
ancient
greek
so
what
you
really
need
to
prove
your
point
mr
decenso
is
an
example
in
ancient
greek
of
someone
committing
apacgw
and
surviving
otherwise
i
would
see
you
as
simply
making
worthless
assertions
without
corresponding
evidence
now
i
would
note
mr
decenso
that
everytime
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
research
it
one
of
your
apparently
contrived
exegisis
i
pretty
much
find
it
false
thus
i
think
that
if
you
are
going
to
add
to
the
text
something
over
and
above
what
the
source
clearly
says
then
you
had
better
have
an
explicit
greek
or
historical
source
to
justify
it
by
the
way
as
to
mr
roses
statement
about
trees
around
the
potters
field
there
are
still
trees
around
the
ledges
and
a
rocky
pavement
at
the
bottom
unless
mr
rose
can
show
that
these
trees
are
two
thousand
years
old
or
that
there
are
year
old
stumps
there
or
has
a
thousand
year
old
description
of
the
area
which
mentions
such
trees
then
it
is
inappropriate
for
him
to
assert
that
the
present
placement
of
trees
prove
the
location
of
the
trees
two
thousand
years
ago
after
all
things
change
now
as
to
your
other
argument
ie
that
the
money
judas
used
is
not
the
same
as
the
silvers
as
to
your
second
question
mr
decenso
you
ask
how
we
could
be
sure
that
the
money
with
which
judas
purchased
the
land
was
indeed
for
the
betrayal
rather
than
some
other
source
i
would
point
out
that
in
acts
where
it
specifically
mention
the
reward
of
iniquity
acts
it
also
specifically
mentions
what
act
of
iniquity
they
were
talking
about
ie
acts
concerning
judas
who
was
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
now
i
would
point
out
that
when
the
bible
describes
an
act
of
iniquity
and
then
immediately
discusses
the
reward
of
iniquity
it
would
be
rather
inane
to
suggest
that
it
was
an
action
of
iniquity
other
than
the
one
discussed
notice
that
in
verse
the
word
iniquity
is
not
used
rather
it
states
that
judas
became
a
guide
to
those
who
arrested
jesus
but
the
writer
did
not
stop
therevs
for
he
was
numbered
with
us
and
obtained
a
part
in
this
ministry
what
part
did
judas
play
in
their
ministry
true
peter
or
the
author
of
acts
does
not
specifically
call
judas
betrayal
an
iniquity
but
for
that
matter
neither
does
john
specifically
call
judas
actions
an
iniquity
either
further
john
did
not
say
that
judas
took
the
money
box
but
rather
said
some
thought
that
because
judas
had
the
money
box
jesus
was
telling
him
buy
what
we
need
for
the
feast
or
that
he
should
give
something
to
the
poor
so
after
receiving
the
morsel
he
immediately
went
out
and
it
was
night
note
that
it
is
said
that
judas
left
it
does
not
say
that
he
took
the
money
box
thus
when
i
see
your
explanation
it
still
seems
to
me
you
would
choose
the
a
an
unproven
iniquity
mentioned
by
another
author
in
a
different
book
written
at
a
different
time
over
the
iniquity
explicitly
mentioned
by
the
author
of
acts
i
find
this
forced
and
contrived
of
course
this
particular
argument
becomes
moot
since
we
have
have
seen
evidence
that
apacgw
means
suicide
you
see
since
judas
hanging
was
successful
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
mentioned
in
john
because
matthew
and
mark
explicitly
say
the
betrayal
was
on
the
high
holy
day
ie
passover
and
thus
he
could
not
have
spent
the
money
before
killing
himself
the
next
day
thus
the
money
which
bought
the
field
of
blood
would
have
to
have
been
the
pieces
of
silver
of
course
he
got
the
pieces
of
silver
that
night
as
well
and
thus
couldnt
have
spent
that
either
oh
dear
i
believe
that
the
house
of
cards
is
comming
down
maybe
we
should
at
this
point
discuss
now
whether
jesus
was
crucified
on
friday
or
saturday
as
that
is
now
part
of
the
argument
about
judas
by
the
way
as
to
where
the
prophesy
of
the
potters
field
came
from
ie
the
mention
of
it
in
matthew
you
say
please
when
we
are
done
with
this
study
on
his
death
remind
me
to
discuss
this
with
you
i
am
reminding
you
now
to
discuss
it
now
its
all
part
of
the
same
verse
we
are
discussing
and
i
wish
you
would
quit
procrastinating
and
sidestepping
these
issues

the
real
problem
americans
have
become
so
insensitive
to
the
needs
of
others
and
so
completely
wrapped
up
in
themselves
that
they
cannot
see
straight
or
think
clearly
enough
to
make
even
the
slightest
and
most
obvious
moral
decisions
based
on
reality
if
a
man
abandons
a
woman
to
care
for
their
child
on
her
own
he
is
not
considered
to
be
a
very
respectable
or
decent
man
by
anyone
this
man
has
fled
his
responsibility
has
behaved
like
a
lazy
coward
and
has
turned
away
from
his
responsibility
to
his
wife
and
child
however
if
a
woman
decides
to
kill
her
unborn
child
to
release
her
burden
she
is
not
thought
of
in
the
same
way
when
the
man
abandons
the
woman
suffers
but
the
child
is
free
to
grow
up
and
live
a
happy
and
normal
life
when
the
woman
abandons
the
child
is
diced
or
killed
with
saline
or
vacuumed
out
and
the
man
has
no
choice
and
the
man
sometimes
suffers
so
badly
that
he
wishes
he
could
trade
places
with
his

ths
root
of
this
whole
problem
is
selfishnessthe
arrogance
that
says
my

your

its
probably
right
and
i
wouldnt
call
that
benevolent
either
it
is
a
move
in
the
right
direction
as
it
is

we

it
out

the

backs
us
completely
real
responsibility
does
not
sell
the
only
responsibility
that
sells
in

is
that
which
is
just
enough
to

they
are
what
i
value
they
are
what
i
would
have
rather
than
not
have
what
i
would
experience
rather
than
not
and
so
on
objective
values
are
a
set
of
values
which
the
proposer
believes
are
applicable
to
everyone
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
objective
value
then
science
can
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
kick
in
the
head
i
dont
agree
science
is
useful
insofar
as
it
the
predictions
mentioned
above
are
accurate
that
is
insofar
as
what
i
think
will
be
the
effect
on
my
perceptions
of
a
time
lapse
with
or
without
my
input
to
the
universe
versus
what
my
perceptions
actually
turn
out
to
be
but
values
are
about
whether
i
like
in
the
loosest
sense
of
the
word
the
perceptions
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
could
not
objectively
be
said
to
be
more
useful
than
a
set
of
tarot
cards
i
dont
see
why
usefulness
in
science
is
synonomous
with
accuracy
period
tarot
predictions
are
not
useful
because
they
are
not
accurate
or
cant
be
shown
to
be
accurate
science
is
useful
because
it
is
apparently
accurate
values
objective
or
otherwise
are
beside
the
point
no
tommy
subject
re
food
for
thought
on
tyre
kingctroncom
john
e
king
writes
not
exactly
the
prophesy
clearly
implies
that
people
would
still
be
living
in
the
area
but
by
the
same
token
it
would
never
be
rebuilt
obviously
if
people
are
still
there
they
would
live
in
houses
correct
their
nets
implies
a
fishing
village
this
is
exactly
what
it
has
become
a
far
cry
from
its
original
position
of
stature
looking
at
we
find
that
during
roman
times
tyre
vied
with
sidon
for
first
place
in
the
intellectual
life
of
the
period
that
tyre
was
the
seat
of
a
christian
bishop
eventually
with
dioceses
under
it
that
the
most
magnificent
church
of
its
kind
in
all
phoenecia
was
the
basilica
built
in
tyre
ca
that
tyre
was
well
known
for
its
exports
of
glassware
wine
white
marble
and
dyed
cloth
that
tyre
along
with
other
seaports
provided
outlets
for
south
arabian
indian
and
even
chinese
trade
that
tyre
had
to
accomodate
its
growing
population
by
following
a
perpendicular
rather
than
horizontal
line
of
growth
because
it
was
running
out
of
land
to
build
on
that
tyre
established
colonies
of
its
own
none
of
this
sounds
like
a
small
fishing
village
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
centuries
later
under
the
abbasids
tyre
had
opulent
and
flourishing
bazaars
and
buildings
of
stories
during
this
period
tyre
was
noted
for
its
export
of
sugar
beads
and
as
of
old
glassware
during
the
crusades
tyre
was
the
secondmost
flourishing
city
held
by
franks
there
is
a
lot
more
but
i
got
tired
of
writing
in
we
read
the
following
description
of
modern
lebanon
other
major
cities
in
lebanon
include
tripoli
sidon
tyre
baalbek
and
zahlah
my
emphasis
this
source
also
discusses
the
impact
of
the
lebanese
civil
war
and
the
israeli
military
actions
on
the
trading
ports
of
tyre
and
sidon
it
notes
that
after
israels
withdrawel
in
tyre
appeared
to
enjoy
a
revival
of
its
local
economy
if
tyre
is
such
an
insignificant
little
fishing
village
at
present
why
is
it
always
called
a
city
or
above
a
major
city
why
does
it
show
up
on
all
the
maps
when
population
figures
for
cities
in
lebanon
are
given
why
is
tyre
always
one
of
the
cities
on
the
list
even
if
the
list
is
only
a
dozen
cities
long

from

federal

lebanon
a
country
study
edited
by
thomas
collelo
in
the
early
tyre
had
over
people
so
far
ive
seen
stated
figurers
ranging
from
to
lets
assume
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standards
we
are
talking
about
a
onehorse
town
a
onehorse
town
sounds
like
a
lot
of
work
for
one
horse
anyway
tyre
is
connected
by
roads
to
the
mainland
they
may
even
use
cars
these
days
the
encyclopedia
britannica
says
pop
est
most
other
references
give
figures
in
the
thousand
range
one
atlas
gives
the
population
of
tyre
as
the
same
source
give
comparatively
high
figures
for
sidon
and
beirut
also
so
i
doubt
that
it
is
a
typo
perhaps
these
were
figures
for
the
cities
and
their
surrounding
areas
i
dont
doubt
that
the
population
of
tyre
has
fluctuated
over
the
last
few
decades
in
particular
the
israeli
military
action
hurt
tyre
quite
a
bit
after
alex
the
g
it
fell
once
more
in
the
i
believe
what
other
times
did
it
fall
that
you
were
thinking
of
to
egypt
bce
to
the
seleucids
bce
rome
bce
after
rome
it
fell
to
various
arab
contingents
until
ce
when
it
was
captured
in
the
crusades
it
was
then
recaptured
again
by
the
muslims
in
ce
and
subsequently
pillaged
then
the
french
turks
british
and
today
lebanon
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
times
that
tyre
was
destroyed
dont
most
if
not
all
of
these
apply
not
just
to
tyre
but
to
the
other
cities
in
the
area
sidon
for
example
can
you
make
a
case
for
tyre
having
been
singled
out
well
it
recovered
enough
to
have
a
thriving
commerce
in
the
dye
tyrian
purple
in
roman
times
this
is
correct
but
they
were
under
roman
domination
and
the
majority
of
the
created
wealth
was
siphoned
off
the
prophesy
hold
true
they
had
a
good
deal
of
autonomy
under
the
seleucids
from
tyre
received
the
rights
of
autonomy
from
antiochus
ephiphanes
and
from
bc
onward
enjoyed
complete
autonomy
she
started
a
large
series
of
coins
occasionally
in
gold
the
descriptions
of
tyre
under
the
romans
dont
seem
to
fit
your
characterization
either
and
under
the
abbasids
it
seems
to
have
been
allowed
to
flourish
i
still
think
you
are
stretching
when
you
try
to
describe
tyre
as
having
been
nothing
but
a
small
fishing
village
who
is
josh
mcdowell
a
christian
apologist
whose
standards
of
scholarship
are
quite
low
he
happens
to
quote
the
same
source
you
quote
nina
jidejian
tyre
through
the
ages
beirut
dar
elmashreq
publishers
the
same
sentence
in
fact
he
defends
the
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
using
the
same
argument
you
are
using
an
argument
that
i
havent
seen
in
print
anywhere
else
which
is
why
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
you
were
quoting
josh
i
tried
to
find
the
jidejian
book
but
it
isnt
listed
in
books
in
print
can
you
tell
me
more
about
it
her
descriptions
are
so
much
at
odds
with
everything
else
ive
read
im
curious
to
know
why
dj
subject
exgay
was
homosexuality
fact
fiction
tony
while
i
honestly
believe
you
believe
you
are
doing
a
good
thing
by
posting
that
piece
of
propaganda
i
believe
the
more
people
believe
that
the
more
they
will
feel
justified
in
their
blatant
persecution
of
gay
oriented
people
i
have
seen
the
film
called
the
gay
agenda
and
along
with
my
church
we
found
it
to
be
horrifying
not
because
of
what
was
actually
shown
cleaver
use
of
editting
can
create
any
image
one
wants
to
portray
rather
becaseu
we
are
familia
familiar
with
how
widely
it
was
actively
distributed
and
how
many
naive
people
are
actually
believing
the
garbage
found
within
it
the
truth
is
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
fully
speak
for
anyone
who
calls
themself
gay
but
knowing
as
many
as
i
do
and
knowing
their
testimonies
and
witnessing
thier
faith
and
life
i
have
to
say
that
the
report
you
posted
is
a
very
biased
report
something
obviously
claimed
against
gays
as
well
the
truth
is
that
unless
you
are
innately
gay
you
cannot
know
what
harm
you
are
causing
i
speak
as
an
abolitionist
who
supports
affirming
gay
rights
in
our
society
i
do
not
support
wild
sex
or
any
other
misrepresentations
perpetrated
by
christian
fundamentalist
extremists
but
i
know
people
who
are
not
the
sexual
deviants
your
report
paints
them
to
be
it
is
no
mistake
that
the
apa
removed
homosexuality
from
its
list
of
mental
illnesses
it
is
also
no
mistake
that
there
are
many
christians
and
homophobes
who
long
to
bring
it
back
to
the
list
i
do
not
feel
threatened
by
gays
i
dont
understand
why
others
are
the
following
is
an
article
concerning

of
the
more

the
founder
of

exgay

group
chooses

by
robert

oriented
magazine
advocate
in
december
david
caligiuri
received
one
of
the
advocates
homophobia
rewaa
awards
the
a
prayer
a
day
keeps
the
lust
away
citation
as
director
of
free
indeed
a
national
exgay
ministry
caligiuri
was
singled
out
for
offering
discontented
gays
and
lesbians
a
way
out
of
the
homosexual
deathstyle
through
prayer
id
like
to
give
the
award
back
caligiuri
now
laughs
im
no
longer
deserve
it
caligiuris
eight
year
involvement
with
the
national
exgay
movement
peaked
with
his
founding
of
the
phoenix
chapter
of
homosexuals
anonymous
ha
as
well
as
free
indeed
he
has
since
abandoned
his
pulpit
and
now
says
that
the
ex
gay
movement
is
a
fruitless
effort
based
on
deception
theres
no
reality
in
it
he
says
i
was
selling
a
product
and
my
product
was
a
lie
headed
up
by
national
ministries
like
exodus
international
and
courage
the
organizations
of
the
exgay
movement
rely
on
the
tenents
of
bornagain
christianity
to
convince
disatisfied
homosexuals
usually
young
gay
men
who
are
just
coming
out
that
they
can
shed
their
sexuality
by
suppressing
their
sexual
urges
and
embracing
christianity
we
offer
support
to
people
who
are
seeking
to
leave
the
sin
of
homosexuality
explains
bob
davies
director
of
exodus
he
ventures
that
about
of
those
seeking
to
abandon
their
homo
sexuality
are
men
anybody
who
is
involved
in
the
exgay
ministry
is
misguided
and
is
wasting
their
time
says
lisa
seeley
a
former
redeemed
lesbian
who
worked
with
caligiuri
as
ha
and
appeared
with
him
on
the
sally
jessy
raphael
show
these
organizations
are
for
people
who
are
spiritually
and
emotionally
wounded
its
possible
to
change
your
identity
or
your
behavior
says
sex
educator
brian
mcnaught
author
of
on
being
gay
but
its
really
impossible
to
change
your
orientation
these
people
are
no
longer
calling
themselves
gay
but
they
continue
to
have
samesex
erotic
feelings
caligiuri
says
he
founded
free
indeed
after
an
ominous
week
in
when
all
hell
broke
loose
in
his
personal
life
a
few
days
after
his
lover
ended
both
their
romance
and
their
business
partnership
caligiuri
was
sexually
assaulted
by
a
man
he
picked
up
in
a
bar
i
was
really
drunk
he
recalls
and
i
went
home
with
this
guy
he
tied
me
up
and
raped
me
he
left
me
tied
up
all
night
and
the
next
morning
he
raped
me
again
when
caligiuri
was
eventually
freed
by
the
attacker
he
returned
home
to
the
home
he
shared
with
his
exlover
he
had
another
man
there
with
him
caligiuri
recalls
i
thought
at
this
time
if
this
is
what
being
gay
is
about
i
dont
want
to
be
this
way
anymore
caligiuri
vowed
that
if
he
could
find
a
way
out
he
would
share
his
discovery
with
others
he
organized
an
antigay
contingent
to
demonstrate
at
phoenixs
gay
pride
parade
in
june
and
a
few
months
later
free
indeed
held
its
first
public
protest
at
a
meeting
to
promote
a
gay
civil
rights
ordinance
free
indeed
members
loudly
blasted
gays
telling
them
ther
were
sinners
headed
for
hell
free
indeed
began
receiving
about
a
hundred
telephone
calls
a
week
thanks
in
part
to
a
deceptive
listing
in
the
local
yellow
pages
we
were
listed
under
lesbian
and
gay
alternative
services
caligiuri
says
so
people
thought
we
were
a
gay
information
switchboard
people
would
call
to
find
out
where
the
local
bars
were
and
wed
preach
to
them
about
the
sins
of
homo
sexuality
ruses
like
this
are
typical
of
the
movement
caligiuri
says
adding
theyll
do
anything
to
reach
these
people
david
used
to
go
on
radio
and
say
really
stupid
things
recalls
peter
kelly
a
counselor
at
phoenixs
catholic
diocese
aids
program
like
that
he
knew
he
was
gay
when
he
started
wearing
pastel
colors
caligiuris
family
first
found
out
about
his
ministry
when
they
saw
him
on
raphaels
syndicated
talk
show
in
they
were
relieved
he
recalls
they
figured
that
if
they
had
to
have
a
gay
person
in
the
family
better
that
i
should
be
a
reformed
gay
person
but
caligiuri
was
hardly
reformed
by
the
time
i
appeared
on
sallys
show
id
started
having
sex
with
men
again
men
would
call
our
hotline
and
tell
me
about
thier
latest
sin
sex
with
their
pastor
sex
with
their
father
i
was
horny
all
the
time
unable
to
risk
going
to
gay
bars
where
he
might
be
recognized
from
his
numerous
television
appearances
caligiuri
says
he
used
to
go
to
bookstores
and
get
blowjobs
when
he
wasnt
working
the
bookstores
he
was
sleeping
with
other
reformed
homosexuals
i
didnt
realize
it
at
first
but
a
lot
of
the
ha
leaders
were
having
sex
with
one
another
caligiuri
says
wed
go
to
conferences
in
other
cities
and
wed
be
paired
up
in
hotel
rooms
everybody
was
sleeping
with
everybody
else
by
the
time
he
appeared
on
am
philadelphia
television
show
in
may
caligiuri
was
having
anonymous
sex
a
couple
times
a
week
when
the
shows
host
asked
him
if
he
ever
acted
on
temptation
his
answer
was
a
lie
caligiuris
duplicity
began
to
take
its
toll
on
him
however
he
was
suffering
from
chrinic
fatigue
syndrome
and
candidiasis
a
dibilitating
yeast
infection
and
this
led
to
his
escape
from
the
sect
i
was
too
sick
to
go
to
church
he
explains
the
more
time
i
spent
away
from
those
people
the
more
i
began
to
feel
like
myself
i
began
to
remember
who
i
used
to
be
late
in
caligiuri
turned
free
indeed
phone
lines
over
to
a
local
church
and
closed
the
ministrys
doors
id
convinced
myself
that
there
is
no
need
in
the
world
for
exgay
people
he
says
today
caligiuri
is
studying
alternative
spiritualities
im
interest
ed
in
belief
systems
that
arent
judgemental
considering
romance
but
not
with
a
christian
and
searching
for
a
new
project
to
devote
himself
to
i
feel
compelled
to
commit
myself
to
gay
causes
he
says
i
want
to
eventually
stop
feeling
guilty
about
what
i
did
and
make
up
for
the
damage
i
may
have
brought
to
our
community
end
article
caligiuris
tory
is
by
no
means
unique
and
i
have
read
several
other
articles
of
former
leaders
and
founders
of
exgay
ministries
who
have
said
very
similar
th
similar
things
fortuantely
not
all
of
them
have
left
christianity
but
have
come
to
realize
that
god
loves
them
despite
the
attitudes
of
others
some
like
chris
glaser
director
of
the
presbyterian
lazarus
project
of
west
hollywood
presbyterian
church
have
actually
been
working
with
the
gay
community
to
bring
them
into
the
sheepfold
of
christ
and
encouraging
real
ethical
values
of
sexuality
within
the
sphere
of
being
gay
i
have
also
as
i
said
talked
and
become
and
become
close
friends
with
many
who
once
attended
such
groups
as
love
in
action
and
others
who
either
once
claimed
to
have
been
reformed
or
who
were
too
honest
with
themselves
to
live
a
lie
no
matter
who
was
disappointed
in
them
some
were
even
encouraged
to
marry
as
a
way
of
sealing
their
new
heterosexuality
only
to
eventually
start
hitting
the
bars
bathhouses
and
bookstores
since
these
were
usually
activities
under
the
concealment
of
night
and
onenightstands
of
promiscuous
behavior
meant
no
continuous
sin
through
a
committed
relationship
this
is
a
horrible
trap
which
the
church
has
dumped
on
the
backs
of
the
truly
gay
oriented
people
and
the
very
inno
cent
victims
in
these
cases
are

they

allow

heterosexuality

celebacy
this

even

up

to
the
degree
that

is
a

is
objectivism
it
provides
more
power

control

for

that
morals
are
relative
then
two
relativists
can
recognize
that
neither

they
can
proceed
to
negotiate
a
workable

that
produces

either

there
is

you

stated
that
the

failure
among

many
were
driven
to
suicidal
thoughts
as
a
result
of

some
personal
thoughts
it
is
of
no
great
astonishment
that
there
is
a
concerted
effort
by
a
major
portion
of
the
church
to
control
and
mandate
change
of
a
minority
among
its
ranks
this
was
the
momentum
behind
the
spanish
inquisition
only
all
they
required
was
a
confession
of
faith
after
much
torture
and
then
to
save
their
souls
they
would
dispatch
them
to
heaven
through
death
even
later
the
bible
was
used
vigorously
to
defend
slavery
oppression
and
segragation
of
africanamericans
even
to
the
justification
of
lynchings
todays
scholars
are
just
a
bit
more
slick
in
their
approach
the
tool
is
still
coersion
but
now
it
is
mostly
by
means
of
brainwashing
and
mind
control
convincing
people
that
they
should
see
themselves
as
less
than
god
sees
them
then
maintaining
a
cultic
hold
on
them
until
it
is
felt
thier
mindconditioning
is
complete
sure
no
one
is
physically
forced
to
stay
in
this
reparative
therapy
but
sheer
social
pressure
is
enough
for
many
to
keep
themselves
in

found
bondage

selfhate
as
an

i
advocate
the
abolishment
of
oppression

against

moral

distinctions
deleted
in
this
case
the
driver
does
not
evolve
but
simply
is
there
would
probably
not
be
any
manifestation
in
an
infant
because
the
moral
code
has
not
been
learnt
yet
ie
the
object
upon
which
the
driver
acts
upon
without
manifestation
though
how
can
the
driver
be
detected
for
all
purposes
it
seems
not
to
exist
until
moral
coding
begins
actually
i
agree
with
your
notion
of
a
driver
except
that
i
think
its
not
moral
but
pre
and
supermoral
it
is
as
i
mentioned
earlier
in
this
thread
a
primal
sense
of
connection
a
pre
and
postnatal
umbilical
the
awareness
of
which
is
expressed
in
a
partial
fragmented
way
that
accomodates
and
forms
in
return
the
language
and
customs
of
a
given
culture
this
halting
pidginenglish
expression
is
i
think
what
we
come
to
call
morality
compare
the
driver
to
an
urge
such
as
jealousy
where
there
is
an
urge
and
an
object
the
jealousy
does
not
technically
exist
until
the
object
is
apparent
however
the
capacity
to
be
jealous
is
presumably
still
there
even
though
it
is
not
detectable
your
description
of
the
unbilical
took
me
three
passes
to
understand
but
i
get
the
gist
and
i
have
to
tentatively
agree
i
think
our
two
definitions
can
sit
side
by
side
without
too
much
trouble
though
i
havent
attempted
to
define
the
reason
behind
the
moral
driver
only
hinted
through
the
essence
of
each
moral
your
definition
hints
that
animals
are
also
capable
of
a
similar
morality
simians
have
a
similar
social
order
to
ourselves
and
it
is
easy
to
anthropomorphize
with
these
animals
is
this
possible
or
have
i
misunderstood
if
my
suggestion
holds
true
then
this
is
the
area
where
work
must
be
carried
out
to
prevent
a
moral
deterioration
of
society
what
kind
of
work
exactly
well
here
you
have
asked
the
big
question
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
that
you
were
hoping
i
would
say
something
really
contentious
in
this
reply
from
your
final
question
no
not
at
all
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
subscribed
to
some
particular
school
of
psychosocial
thought
and
rehabilitation
and
if
perhaps
you
had
a
plan
id
have
been
interested
to
hear
it
my
ps
thoughts
falls
roughly
in
line
with
john
stuart
mill
and
his
writings
on
utilitarianism
i
have
no
particular
plan
except
to
do
my
bit
personal
ethics
and
social
work
my
opinion
for
what
it
is
worth
is
that
the
authority
for
each
moral
must
be
increased
somehow
and
that
this
will
probably
take
several
generations
to
be
effective
i
dont
think
that
the
list
of
morals
has
changed
for
society
significantly
though
the
authority
element
may
come
from
our
authority
figures
and
roles
models
see
eric
berne
and
his
transactional
analysis
work
mavis
klein
for
references
and
this
is
what
gives
rise
to
a
deterioration
of
moral
standards
in
the
long
term
ive
had
some
more
thoughts
on
my
definitions
ive
was
thinking
that
i
should
add
moral
character
to
the
list
of
definitions
in
order
to
get
a
dynamic
version
of
the
moral
nature
ie
the
interplay
of
the
moral
code
and
associated
authorities
a
suitable
analogy
might
be
a
graphic
equaliser
on
a
hifi
system
the
moral
nature
being
the
set
of
frequencies
and
the
chosen
amplitudes
and
the
moral
character
being
the
spectrum
over
time
conscience
is
a
little
more
difficult
because
i
cant
define
it
as
the
reasoning
of
a
person
between
actions
in
the
context
of
his
moral
nature
because
conscience
seems
to
cut
in
most
of
the
time
unbidden
and
often
unwanted
i
think
conscience
is
manifest
when
a
decision
is
made
at
a
given
time
which
compromises
ones
moral
nature
my
conscience
fits
in
more
with
freuds
superego
plus
the
moral
driver
with
the
stimulous
being
the
urges
or
freuds
id
the
reasoning
that
i
mentioned
before
is
freuds
ego
i
suppose
if
the
moral
driver
is
part
of
the
id
then
the
reason
why
conscience
cuts
in
unbidden
is
partially
explained
the
question
is
what
provides
the
stimulous
to
activate
the
moral
driver
i
think
i
need
some
more
time
with
this
one
thats
about
it

re
question
for
those
with
popular
morality
in
article
james

writes

a
previous
article
davidterminusericssonse
david
bold
says
i
dont
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
think
that
youve
got
hold
of
the
wrong
end
of
a
different
stick
david
i
had
a
look
at
your
posting
again
and
i
see
what
you
mean
i
was
so
intent
on
explaining
how
jung
thought
we
could
be
more
moral
than
god
that
i
overlooked
your
main
line
of
thought
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
god
being
unknowable
his
morality
is
unknowable
yep
thats
pretty
much
it
im
not
a
jew
but
i
understand
that
this
is
the
jewish
way
of
thinking
however
the
jews
believe
that
the
covenant
between
yhwh
and
the
patriarchs
abraham
and
moses
in
this
case
establishes
a
moral
code
to
follow
for
mankind
even
the
jews
could
not
decide
where
the
boundaries
fall
though
as
i
understand
it
the
sadducees
believed
that
the
torah
was
all
that
was
required
whereas
the
pharisees
the
ancestors
of
modern
judaism
believed
that
the
torah
was
available
for
interpretation
to
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
required
morality
in
all
its
nuances
talmud
the
essence
of
all
of
this
is
that
biblical
morality
is
an
interface
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
anything
about
yhwh
outside
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
speculate
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
that
man
is
supposed
to
be
created
in
his
image
so
there
is
an
argument
that
we
are
committed
to
whatever
moral
code
he
follows
as
part
of
trying
to
live
up
to
that
image
if
we
are
supposed
to
live
by
christs
example
you
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
god
is
a
do
what
i
say
not
what
i
do
kind
of
guy
the
trouble
with
all
of
this
is
that
we
dont
really
know
what
the
created
in
his
image
means
ive
heard
a
number
of
different
opinions
on
this
and
have
still
not
come
to
any
conclusion
this
rather
upsets
the
apple
cart
if
one
wants
to
base
a
life
script
on
this
shaky
foundation
to
mix
metaphors
unashamedly
as
to
living
by
christs
example
we
know
very
little
about
jesus
as
a
person
we
only
have
his
recorded
utterances
in
a
set
of
narratives
by
his
followers
and
some
very
small
references
from
comtemporary
historians
revelation
aside
one
can
only
know
christ
secondhand
or
worse
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
debunk
christianity
although
it
may
seem
that
way
initially
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
we
only
really
have
the
bible
to
interpret
and
that
interpretation
is
by
humanity
i
guess
this
is
where
faith
or
relevation
comes
in
with
all
its
inherent
subjectiveness
metaphysically
if
there
are
multiple
moral
codes
then
there
is
no
absolute
moral
code
and
i
think
this
is
theologically
questionable
no
there
may
be
an
absolute
moral
code
there
are
undoubtably
multiple
moral
codes
the
multiple
moral
codes
may
be
founded
in
the
absolute
moral
code
as
an
example
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assume
that
the
parent
never
swears
simply
because
the
parent
has
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
children
the
wrongness
here
is
if
the
child
disobeys
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
swear
in
front
of
children
but
may
be
quite
happy
to
swear
in
front
of
animals
the
analogy
does
not
quite
hold
water
because
the
child
knows
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
as
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incidentally
the
young
child
considers
the
directive
as
absolute
until
he
gets
older
see
piaget
and
learns
a
morality
of
his
own

then
science

simple

you
like
those
conclusions
i
dont
i
think
that
you
are
changing
the
meaning
of
values
here
perhaps
it
is
time
to
backtrack
and
take
a
look
at
the
word
value
n
a
fair
equivalent
or
return
for
something
such
as
goods
or
service
monetary
or
material
worth
worth
as
measured
in
usefulness
or
importance
merit
a
principle
standard
or
quality
considered
inherently
worthwhile
or
desirable
precise
meaning
as
of
a
word
an
assigned
or
calculated
numerical
quantity
mus
the
relative
duratation
of
a
tone
or
rest
the
relative
darkness
or
lightness
of
a
color
the
distinctive
quality
of
a
speech
or
speech
sound
in
context
of
a
moral
system
definition
four
seems
to
fit
best
in
terms
of
scientific
usage
definitions
six
or
eight
might
apply
note
that
these
definitions
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
in
my
mind
to
say
that
science
has
its
basis
in
values
is
a
bit
of
a
reach
science
has
its
basis
in
observable
fact
even
the
usages
of
the
word
value
above
do
not
denote
observable
fact
but
rather
a
standard
of
measurement
i
would
conclude
that
science
does
not
have
its
basis
in
values
and
so
your
statement
above
fails
in
fact
if
one
concludes
that
a
scientific
set
of
measurements
values
are
based
on
systems
derived
from
observation
then
it
must
follow
that
in
a
scientific
context
there
is
no
such
thing
as
there
is
no
such
thing
as
objective
values
back
to
the
present
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
moral
system
anyhow
just
because
the
word
values
is
used
in
both
contexts
does
not
mean
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
two
contexts
if
one
is
to
argue
for
objective
values
in
a
moral
sense
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstrating
that
morality
itself
is
objective
considering
the
meaning
of
the
word
objective
i
doubt
that
this
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
original
question
and
objective
morality
is
if
you
can
provide
an
objective
foundation
for
morality
then
that
will
be
a
good
beginning

the

to
post
a

this
your

you

you
noted
that
stephen

call
it

but
the
lack

does
not
constitute
evidence

the

a
common
creationist
error
so
the
fact
that
stephen

not

to

not
justify
the
conclusion
that
stephen
condoned
taking

out

you
asked
stephen

both

you

stephen
assume

assumed

was

just
briefly
on
something
that
you
mentioned
in
passing
you
refer
to
differing
interpretations
of
create
and
say
that
many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
it
may
be
irrelevant
to
you
and
your
personal
beliefs
or
should
i
say
bias
but
it
is
relevant
to
me
and
many
others
youre
right
the
bottom
line
is
truth
independant
from
you
or
anyone
else
since
you
proclaim
truths
as
a
selfproclaimed
appointee
may
i
ask
you
by
what
authority
you
do
this
because
it
says
so
in
the
bible
does
the
bible
say
so
or
is
it
you
or
someone
else
who
interprets
whether
a
scripture
or
doctrine
conforms
to
your
particular
liking
or
disapproval
excuse
moi
but
your
line
of
truths
havent
moved
me
one
bit
to
persuade
me
that
my
beliefs
are
erroneous
of
all
the
preachers
of

me
as
a
selfrighteous
member
of

crew
with
no
positive
message
to
me
or
other
latterday
saints
whatsoever
btw
this
entire
discussion
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
things
said
by
jesus
to
the
pharisees
ye
hypocrites
ye
preach
about
me
with
your
lips
but
your
hearts
are
far
removed
from
me
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
sophistry
look
whos
talking
jumping
to
conclusions
you
wouldnt
do
that
yourself
right
all
you
address
is
your
own
convictions
regardless
whether
we
come
up
with
any
biblical
scriptures
which
supports
our
points
of
view
because
you
reject
such
interpretations
without
any
consideration
whatsoever
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
a
beautiful
example
of
disinformation
and
a
deliberate
misrepresentation
of
lds
doctrine
the
former
kgb
would
have
loved
to
employ
you
jesus
and
lucifer
are
not
the
same
silly
and
you
know
it
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
correction
it
may
contradict
would
you
think
the
bible
says
the
bible
indeed
does
teach
that
not
all
are
children
of
god
in
the
sense
that
they
belong
to
or
follow
god
in
his
footsteps
satan
and
his
followers
have
rebelled
against
god
and
are
not
children
followersredeemed
of
god
but
it
doesnt
mean
that
they
were
not
once
created
by
god
but
chose
to
separate
themselves
from
those
who
chose
to
follow
god
and
his
plan
of
salvation
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
matthew
so
this
illustrates
nicely
what
i
just
said
the
children
of
the
kingdom
are
those
who
have
remained
valiant
in
their
testimony
of
jesus
and
have
shown
works
of
repentance
etc
and
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
are
those
who
rebelled
against
god
and
the
lamb
the
issue
of
satans
spiritoffspring
and
those
who
followed
him
has
not
been
addressed

is

different

jesus
and
can

the
jesus
in

not
your
interpretation
of
him
i
concur
but
i
honestly
couldnt
care
less
ra
one
as
being
true
denies
the
other
from
being
true
according
to
the
ra
bible
eternal
life
is
dependent
on
knowing
the
only
true
god

ra
not

group
first
get
your
ldsfacts
straight
before
you
dare
preaching
to
us
about
the
only
true
god
whom
you
interpret
according
to
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
but
whose
image
i
cannot
reconcile
with
what
i
know
about
him
myself
i
guess
your
grandiose
selfimage
does
not
allow
for
other
faiths
believing
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
but
in
a
different
way
or
fashion
than
your
own
not
that
it
really
matters
the
mission
and
progress
of
the
lds
church
will
go
on
boldly
and
nobly
and
no
mob
or

can

it

swept

this

it

rather
it

obfuscate

try

something
into

doesnt
change
what
the

teaches
sigh
what
the
bible
teaches
or
what
the
bible
teaches
according
to
robert
weiss
and
co
i
respect
the
former
i
reject
the
latter
without
the
remotest
feeling
that
i
have
rejected
jesus
on
the
contrary
and
by
the
way
i
do
respect
your
interpretations
of
the
bible
i
even
grant
you
being
a

following
your

of

as
much
as
i
am

of

have

hopscotched

indication
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainly
be
the
issue
is
of
course
that
you
love
to
use
anything
to
either
mis
represent
or
ridicule
the
lds
church
the
issue
of
official
doctrine
is
obviously
very
important
mcconkies
views
have
been
controversial
eg
the
seven
deadly
heresies
has
made
me
a
heretic
at
best
or
erroneous
at
worst
blacks
not
to
receive
the
priesthood
in
this
dispensation
i
respect
him
as
someone
who
has
made
his
valuable
contribution
to
the
church
but
i
personally
do
not
rely
on
his
personal
interpretations
his
book
mormon
doctrine
is
oftentimes
referred
to
as
mcconkies
bible
in
mormon
circles
on
mormon
doctrine
i
rather
look
to
official
doctrinal
sources
and
to
hugh
nibleys
books
the
last
comment
is
an
ldsinsider
reference
summarizing
mcconkie
was
a
wise
man
who
contributed
undoubtedly
far
more
to
the
kingdom
of
god
than
i
have
but
whose
views
are
by
no
means
dogma
or
accepted
doctrine
some
of
it
clearly
belongs
to
personal
interpretation
and
speculation
but
having
said
this
i
find
mcconkie
even
in
his
most
biased
and
speculative
moments
far
more
thoughtprovoking
than
the
trash
coming
from
your
proverbial
pen
im
somewhat
appalled
that

are

the

way
that
any

you
examine

makes
and
try

observe

if
you
dont
or
if
you
observe
things
that
the

wouldnt

then
you
have
some

against

theory
if
the
theory
cant
be
modified
to
incorporate
the

then
you
say
that
it
is
false
for

people

if
there
is
a
western
ethic
against
infanticide
why
are
so
many
children
dying
all
over
the
world
the
majority
of
the
world
isnt
western
superficially
a
good
answer
but
it
isnt
that
simple
an
awful
lot
of
the
starvation
and
poverty
in
the
world
is
directly
caused
by
the
economic
policies
of
the
western
countries
as
well
as
by
the
diet
of
the
typical
westerner
for
instance
some
thirdworld
countries
with
terrible
malnutrition
problems
export
all
the
soya
they
can
produce
so
that
it
can
be
fed
to
cattle
in
the
us
to
make
tender
juicy
steaks

they

do

to

the

loans
we

take
out

is
a
truly
bizarre
idea
instead
we
ought
to
stop
bleeding
them
for
every
penny
theyve
got
perhaps
its
more
accurate
to
say
that
theres
a
western
ethic
against
western
infanticide
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
so
long
as
the
children
are
dying
in
the
third
world
we
couldnt
give
a
shit
and
that
goes
for
the
supposed
prolife
movement
too
they
could
save
far
more
lives
by
fighting
against
third
world
debt
than
they
will
by
fighting
against
abortion
hell
if
theyre
only
interested
in
fetuses
they
could
save
more
of
those
by
fighting
for
human
rights
in
china
and
besides
suzannes
answer
implies
that
nonwestern
countries
lack
this
ethic
against
infanticide
apart
from

just
briefly
on
something
that
you
mentioned
in
passing
you
refer
to
differing
interpretations
of
create
and
say
that
many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
it
may
be
irrelevant
to
you
and
your
personal
beliefs
or
should
i
say
bias
but
it
is
relevant
to
me
and
many
others
youre
right
the
bottom
line
is
truth
independant
from
you
or
anyone
else
since
you
proclaim
truths
as
a
selfproclaimed
appointee
may
i
ask
you
by
what
authority
you
do
this
because
it
says
so
in
the
bible
does
the
bible
say
so
or
is
it
you
or
someone
else
who
interprets
whether
a
scripture
or
doctrine
conforms
to
your
particular
liking
or
disapproval
excuse
moi
but
your
line
of
truths
havent
moved
me
one
bit
to
persuade
me
that
my
beliefs
are
erroneous
of
all
the
preachers
of
truth
on
this
net
you
have
struck
me
as
a
selfrighteous
member
of
the
wrecking
crew
with
no
positive
message
to
me
or
any
other
latterday
saint
btw
this
entire
discussion
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
things
said
by
jesus
to
the
pharisees
ye
hypocrites
ye
preach
about
me
with
your
lips
but
your
hearts
are
far
removed
from
me
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
sophistry
look
whos
talking
jumping
to
conclusions
you
wouldnt
do
that
yourself
right
all
you
address
is
your
own
convictions
regardless
whether
we
come
up
with
any
biblical
scriptures
which
supports
our
points
of
view
because
you
reject
such
interpretations
without
any
consideration
whatsoever
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
a
beautiful
example
of
disinformation
and
a
deliberate
misrepresentation
of
lds
doctrine
the
former
kgb
would
have
loved
to
employ
you
jesus
and
lucifer
are
not
the
same
silly
and
you
know
it
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
correction
it
may
contradict
would
you
think
the
bible
says
the
bible
indeed
does
teach
that
not
all
are
children
of
god
in
the
sense
that
they
belong
to
or
follow
god
in
his
footsteps
satan
and
his
followers
have
rebelled
against
god
and
are
not
children
followersredeemed
of
god
but
it
doesnt
mean
that
they
were
not
once
created
by
god
but
chose
to
separate
themselves
from
those
who
chose
to
follow
god
and
his
plan
of
salvation
the
field
is
the
world
the
good
seed
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
but
the
tares
are
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
matthew
so
this
illustrates
nicely
what
i
just
said
the
children
of
the
kingdom
are
those
who
have
remained
valiant
in
their
testimony
of
jesus
and
have
shown
works
of
repentance
etc
and
the
children
of
the
wicked
one
are
those
who
rebelled
against
god
and
the
lamb
the
issue
of
satans
spiritorigin
and
of
those
who
followed
him
has
not
been
addressed
in
this

the

are

that
to

my
jesus
is
indeed
different
than
your
jesus
and
can
be
reconciled
with
the
jesus
in
the
bible
not
your
interpretation
of
him
i
concur
but
i
honestly
couldnt
care
less
ra
one
as
being
true
denies
the
other
from
being
true
according
to
the
ra
bible
eternal
life
is
dependent
on
knowing
the
only
true
god
and
ra
not
the
construct

imagination
in
this
single
posting
of
yours
ive
seen
more
constructs
of
imagination
than
in
all
of
the
prolds
mails
combined
i
have
read
so
far
in
this
news
group
first
get
your
ldsfacts
straight
before
you
dare
preaching
to
us
about
the
only
true
god
whom
you
interpret
according
to
your
own
likes
and
dislikes
but
whose
image
i
cannot
reconcile
with
what
i
know
about
him
myself
i
guess
your
grandiose
selfimage
does
not
allow
for
other
faiths
believing
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
but
in
a
different
way
or
fashion
than
your
own
not
that
it
really
matters
the
mission
and
progress
of
the
lds
church
will
go
on
boldly
and
nobly
and
no
mob
or
opponent
can
stop
the
work
from
progressing
until
it
has
visited
every
continent
swept
every
clime
and
sounded
in
every
ear
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
sigh
what
the
bible
teaches
or
what
the
bible
teaches
according
to
robert
weiss
and
co
i
respect
the
former
i
reject
the
latter
without
the
remotest
feeling
that
i
have
rejected
jesus
on
the
contrary
and
by
the
way
i
do
respect
your
interpretations
of
the
bible
i
even
grant
you
being
a
christian
following
your
own
image
of
him
as
much
as
i
am
a
christian
following
my
own
image
of
him
in
my
heart
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters

mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies
writings
indicative

mormon
belief
on
this
subject
is
the
real
issue
the
indication
from
rick

that
they
may
certainly
be
the
issue
is
of
course
that
you
love
to
use
anything
to
either
mis
represent
or
ridicule
the
lds
church
the
issue
of
official
doctrine
is
obviously
very
important
mcconkies
views
have
been
controversial
eg
the
seven
deadly
heresies
has
made
me
a
heretic
at
best
or
erroneous
at
worst
blacks
not
to
receive
the
priesthood
in
this
dispensation
i
respect
him
as
someone
who
has
made
his
valuable
contribution
to
the
church
but
i
personally
do
not
rely
on
his
personal
interpretations
his
book
mormon
doctrine
is
oftentimes
referred
to
as
mcconkies
bible
in
mormon
circles
on
mormon
doctrine
i
rather
look
to
official
doctrinal
sources
and
to
hugh
nibleys
books
the

comment
is
an

reference
summarizing
mcconkie
was

who
contributed
undoubtedly
far
more
to
the

whose
views
are

dogma
or

doctrine
some
of

clearly

having
said
this
i
find
mcconkie
even
in
his
most
biased
and
speculative
moments
far
more
thoughtprovoking
than

the

fact
that
the

the
hebrew
scriptures
better
than
anyone
else
yet
they
did
not
convert

no

this

one
might

would

the

what
happened
to
the

americas
culture
is
seen
as
different
and
undesirable
in
the
west
particular
in
the
us
with
its
failed
melting
pot
concept
most
tribes
have
been
hunted
to
extinction
the
hebrew
tribe
is
one
of
the
few
survivers
from
the
neolithic
of
course
it
becomes
difficult
at
times
to
separate
christianity
from
the
western
experience

its

re

was

the
observation
that
the

of

would
rotate
clockwise
in

northern
hemisphere

counterclockwise
in

southern
probably
doesnt

enough
consideration
to
the
feebleness
of
the
coriolis
force
compared
to
say
the
phototropism
of
vegetation
a
much
more
likely
explanation
is
the
classic
one
that
the
clockwise
swastika
is
the
sunwheel
because
the
sun
progresses
across
the
sky
that
way
although
thats
not
the
historical
way
it
happened
clocks
were
first
made
as
little
imitation
images
of
the
sun
moving
thru
the
heavens
so
its
more
valid
to
talk
of
the
clock
going
sunwise
but
do
the
engineers
listen
to
me
of
course
not
anyway
there
is
still
much
uncertainty
about
whether
the
antiswastika
goes
countersunwise
because
that
represents
evil
or
because
it
is
the
suns
twinopposite
the
moonwheel
the
use
of
antisun
to
represent
evil
may
be
because
humans
are

much
differently
than
had

the
case
regarding
hymenaeus
beta
frater
superior
of
the

to
which
i
belong
when
he
included
that
bit
from

he

us
the
extremes
to

order
members
have
been
known
to
go

i
have

surely
he
was
an
unusual
man
and
he
was
an
important
force
in
the

for
many
years
yet
as
people
change
so
do

change
and
while
we
look

so
carefully
at

remember
that
this
is
only
the
surface
skim
and
that
many
perspectives
are
now
encompassed
which
extend
beyond
any
one
individual
i
hope
to
show
that
there
was
and
is
much
room
for
a
difference
of
opinion
within
the
order
itself
perhaps
by
testing
the
limits
myself
let
us
examine
this
issue
a
bit
more
closely
in
karl
kellner
a
wealthy
austrian
industrialist
and
paper
chemist
as
well
as
a
highgrade
mason
founded
the
ordo
templi
orientis
kellner
had
traveled
widely
in
the
east
where
he
met
three
adepts
who
instructed
him
specific
magical
practices
kellners
efforts
to
develop
the
order
were
later
assisted
by
franz
hartmann
heinrich
klein
and
theodore
reuss
who
had
worked
together
prior
to
joining
the
oto
the
order
was
first
proclaimed
in
in
reusss
masonic
publication
oriflamme
on
kellners
death
reuss
succeeded
him
as
outer
head
oho
the
jubilee
edition
of
the
oriflamme
published
in
announced
that
the
order
taught
secret
of
sexual
magic
theodore
reuss
was
an
interesting
character
born
june
in
augsburg
he
entered
masonry
in
he
was
a
singer
journalist
and
possibly
a
spy
for
the
prussian
political
police
infiltrating
the
socialist
league
founded
by
karl
marxs
daughter
and
her
husband
reuss
was
later
associated
with
william
wynn
westcott
a
leader
of
the
golden
dawn
who
later
introduced
him
to
john
yarker
yarker
chartered
reuss
to
found
the
rites
of
memphis
and
mizraim
in
germany
after
several
attempts
to
concretize
various
masonic
rites
reuss
settled
on
the
development
of
the
oto
the
order
experienced
reasonably
steady
growth
under
reuss
leadership
for
example
he
chartered
papus
in
france
rudolph
steiner
in
berlin
and
h
spencer
lewis
in
the
usa
in
the
historic
meeting
between
reuss
and
crowley
occurred
crowley
wrote
that
reuss
came
to
him
and
accused
him
of
revealing
order
secrets
when
crowley
looked
at
it
afresh
the
initiated
interpretation
of
sexual
magick
unfolded
itself
to
him
for
the
first
time
reuss
appointed
crowley
as
supreme
and
holy
king
of
all
the
english
speaking
world
and
it
was
this
authorization
that
he
invoked
when
publishing
the
material
of
the
equinox
reuss
resigned
as
outer
head
of
the
order
in
after
suffering
a
stroke
and
named
crowley
his
successor
all
was
well
until
when
the
book
of
the
law
was
translated
into
german
there
was
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
the
order
manyk
members
split
with
the
new
oho
over
the
book
which
crowley
was
actively
promulgating
through
the

hymenaeus
beta
frater
superior
rex
summus
sanctissimus
caliph
of
the
united
states
of
america
published
by
samuel
weiser
there
are
many
possible
reasons
that
our
frater
superior
included
this
material
in
equinox
and
this
is
the
real
point
is
it
not
why
did
he
wish
to
publish
such
things
about
the
history
of
his
own
organization
does
he
represent
a
dogmatic
threat
to
the
principle
of
thelema
or
is
he
exercising
his
true
will
and
putting
forth
very
complex
pictures
with
no
easy
answers
a
picture
which
leaves
room
for
very
many
interpretations
it
is
quite
easy
for
me
to
see
for
example
that
all
of
oto
derived
out
of
the
dribble
of
faltering
masonry
purchased
by
clever
hucksters
with
an
ounce
of
courage
and
some
writing
ability
to
aid
them
and
i
can
take
that
all
the
way
down
to
our
present
caliph
whose
feeble
support
of
the
law
of
thelema
is
laughable
at
best
would
i
be
thrown
out
of
the
order
for
speaking
in
this
way
will
i
i
think
not
why
because
my
frater
will
see
it
as
a
perspective
an
interjection
i
am
using
as
an
example
my
illustration
shows
that
we
may
express
things
in
the
context
of
a
larger
work
and
the
true
significance
of
this
may
be
quite
difficult
to
apprehend
at
first
so
it
may
be
with
oto
and
merlinus
x
please
look
oto
more
carefully
i
do
not
support
reusss
words
myself
as
i
am
not
qualified
to
assess
them
and
i
am
critical
of
their
pomposity
if
i
who
am
a
member
of
the
order
take
such
a
stand
and
am
allowed
to
continue
doing
so
then
what
can
this
say
about
the
health
of
the
order
does
it
mean
that
the
order
has
gone
soft
and
abandoned
its
moral
principles
or
does
it
mean
that
it
is
strong
in
its
ability
to
let
the
will
of
universal
kinship
arise
on
its
own
not
shackled
by
some
dogmatic
requirement
how
shall
we
resolve
these
two
possibilities
i
find
a
high
calibre
of
individual
associated
with
ordo
templi
orientis
they
are
often
quite
intelligent
and
sometimes
very
well
versed
in
arcane
or
usual
information
they
are
quite
often
artists
and
geniuses
having
met
some
longstanding
members
in
the
sf
bay
area
many
who
are
or
were
very
heavily
involved
with
the
order
i
can
vouch
for
the
integrity
of
the
organization
as
it
stands
i
have
sometimes
questioned
the
policy
of
hymenaeus
beta
in
these
moments
i
followed
my
intuition
and
ive
found
little
to
stop
me
from
requesting
a
second
initiation
from
a
different
oto
body
im
happily
participating
in
social
groups
feasts
or
initiations
and
have
come
to
know
the
gnostic
mass
well
enough
for
my
tastes
this
doesnt
make
me
an
authority
on
order
politics
and
explanations
however
i
can
only
hypothesize
and
relay
to
you
what
i
understand
based
on
my
limited
contact
with
other
members
i
urge
you
not
to
take
the
words
of
merlinus
x
too
far
there
are
many
ways
to
interpret
words
and
many
people
who
have
become
involved
with
the
order
feel
very
strongly
about
the
sanctity
of
personal
freedom
and
the
preservation
of
individual
vision
i

other

on
this
issue

will
be

perhaps
you
should
read
it
and
stop
advancing
the
bible
as
evidence
relating
to
questions
of
science
it
did
jesus
exist
by
g
a
wells
there
is
a
great
fallacy
in
your
statement
the
question
of
origins
is
based
on
more
than
science
alone
nope
no
fallacy
yep
science
is
best
in
determining
how
religions
handle
why
and
who
the
problem
is
that
most
scientists
exclude
the
possibility
of
the
supernatural
in
the
question
of
origins
is
this
is
a
fair
premise
not
entirely
its
not
a
premise
its
a
conclusion
second
that
scientists
for
the
most
part
exlude
the
possibility
is
not
a
problem
its
a
necessity
scientists
are
empircists
not
theologians
i
utterly
reject
the
hypothesis
that
science
is
the
highest
form
of
truth
so
do
scientists
and
long
before
you
did
clearly
you
have
a
deep
and
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
science
if
you
met
a
man
who
could
walk
on
water
raise
people
from
the
dead
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
god
and
then
referred
to
the
inviolability
of
the
scriptures
this
would
affect
your
belief
in
the
origin
of
man
i
can
expand
on
this
nope
wouldnt
affect
my
knowledge
not
belief
of
origins
of
anatomically
modern
humans
if
that
man
could
show
me
something
better
id
change
even
if
it
was
the
biblical
story
in
exact
detail
but
then
i
would
ask
why
in
the
world
did
your
father
endow
us
with
intellect
and
reason
and
then
proceed
to
fool
us
i
mean
the
bible
says
nothing
about
the
humanlike
creatures
that
we
know
exist
some
of
these
socalled
humanlike
creatures
were
apes
some
were
humans
some
were
fancifully
reconstructed
from
fragments
absolutely
and
utterly
false
except
for
some
were
amhs
lucy
australopithecus
afarensis
ca
to
mya
is
complete
and
about
taking
into
consideration
bilateral
symmetry
lucy
walked
upright
and
bipedally
just
like
humans
and
the
two
share
a
remarkably
similar
dental
pattern
her
cranial
morphology
is
unlike
humans
or
modern
apes
there
are
hundreds
of
other
specimens
of
this
and
other
species
of
which
only
some
are
partially
reconstructed
they
exist
bill
you
can
touch
them
feel
them
hold
them
but
forget
hominids
the
earth
the
universe
the
cultural
record
all
look
and
test
out
as
ancient
indeed
they
are
not
reconstructions
has
god
has
tricked
us
here
too
it
wont
go
away
bill
i
doubt
any
of
us
will
meet
a
man
like
this
but
bill
if
your
version
of
all
this
is
absolutely
correct
im
still
no
worried
about
my
salvation
ill
probaby
make
it
i
dont
steal
murder
covet
etc
and
i
like
to
help
other
people
all
i
did
was
use
the
reason
and
intellect
your
god
provided
he
or
she
benevolent
and
loving
will
understand
my
dilemma
dont
you
think
good
deeds
do
not
justify
a
person
in
gods
sight
an
atonement
jesus
is
needed
to
atone
for
sin
so
you
and
other
fundamentalists
say
what
about
the
billions
who
dont
say
so
beware
of
people
who
say
they
have
the
truth
bill
and
reconsider
each
time
you
think
you
do
science
and
the
bible
are
not
in
contradiction
god
can
supercede
the
scientific
laws
as
man
understands
them
creation
is
a
good
example
god
has
the
power
to
create
something
out
of
nothing
order
out
of
chaos
havent
been
on
to
long
but
i
have
a
feeling
bill
that
the
veterans
will
agree
with
you
here
no
contradiciton
and
god
can
do
anything
at
will
so
whats
the
beef
or
more
properly
wheres
my
point
god
is
the
creator
looks
like
we
agree
that
was
not
your
point
bill
your
point
above
was
god
has
the
power
scientists
generally
agree
with
that
thats
a
far
cry
from
saying
god
did
please
attempt
to
understand
your
own
posts
if
the
title
of
the
book
you
mentioned
has
anything
to
do
with
the
substance
of
the
book
it
must
be
a
real
laugher
of
course
jesus
existed
and
there
are
volumes
of
evidence
to
back
it
up
i
can
give
many
if
you
are
interested
its
not
a
laugher
bill
its
a
scholarly
book
that
many
happen
to
disagree
with
i
am
definitely
and
seriously
interested
in
confirmation
i
know
of
the
bible
inferences
therefrom
eg
prophecies
apocrypha
the
koran
and
others
what
i
am
interested
is
independent
evidence
do
you
have
any
i
know
of
josephus
but
this
is
almost
certainly
an
insertion
also
i
know
of
a
few
roman
documents

pliny

these
deal

do

who
also
wrote
of

in
addition
the
four
gospel
accounts
are
very
much
in
harmony
bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblical
scholars
consider
the
josephus
reference
to
be
an
early
christian
insert
by
biblical
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
research
is
willing
to
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
this
excludes
literalists
who
may
otherwise
be
defined
as
biblical
apologists
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthy
by
scholarly
standards
and
others
why
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
times
the
passage
is
glaringly
out
of
context
and
josephus
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewhere
in
his
work
the
passage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lies
it
suddenly
appears
and
then
just
as
quickly
disappears
until
you
can
demonstrate
how
and
why
the
scholarly
community
is
wrong
about
the
josephus
insert
your
proof
is
meaningless
and
it
should
not
be
repeated
here
whats
more
even
if
josephus
happened
to
be
legitimate
it
would
prove
nothing
scholars
speak
of
the
weight
of
evidence
far
more
independent
evidence
would
be
required
to
validate
your
claim
until
forthcoming
your
belief
is
based
on
faith
thats
ok
but
you
exceed
your
rights
when
you
pass
faith
off
as
fact
as
for
the
gospels
there
are
parallels
but
there
are
also
glaring
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
shouldnt
a
perfect
canon
be
perfect
shouldnt
there
be
absolutely
no
room
for
debate
i
suggest
you
read
gospel
fictions
by
randel
helms
and
the
unauthorized
version
by
robin
fox
for
herb
huston
no
known
kinship
or
familial
relationship
but
we
do
indeed
share
an
evolutionary
ancestry
the
fact
that
there
are
inconsistencies
gaps
and
contradictions
does
not
deny
your
position
on
the
other
hand
neither
do
the
gospels
prove
your
faith
independent
evidence
is
necessary
and
i
know
of
none
which
we
have
already
discussed
and
so
far
you
have
not
provided
any
until
then
its
faith
moreover
you
have
committed
a
fundamental
error
in
logic
you
have
attempted
to
prove
your
claim
with
that
which
you
want
to
prove
its
no
different
than
saying
i
am
right
because
i
say
so
your
logic
is
full
of
circles
it
reminds
me
a
bit
of
the
presbyterian
general
assembly
the
assembly
defined
five
fundamentals
this
is
where
fundamentalist
came
from
of
orthodox
protestant
christianity
to

jesus
performed
miracles
jesus
was
born
of
a
virgin
jesus
was
bodily
resurrected
jesus
crucifixion
atoned
for
human
sin
and
here
is
the
clincher
the
bible
is
the
inerrant
word
of
god
presbyterians
construe
inerrant
broadly
as
spritually
inerrant
fundamentalists
take
the
first
four
as
literally
true
and
then
validate
them
with
a
literally
inerrant
bible

four

which
is
the

do
you
mean
its
moral
to
use
force
on
someone
who
advocates
the
use
of
force
with
a
few
provisos
yes
minimum
force
for
a
start
and
it
depends
on
what
is
being
forced
on
either
side
or
do
you
mean
that
sometimes
we
have
to
use
force
on
such
people
out
of
necessity
or
selfdefence
while
recognizing
that
our
own
actions
in
doing
so
are
not
moral
my
opinion
is
that
our
actions
would
be
moral
and
it
would
be
immoral
not
to
act
if
action
would
be
both
necessary
and
effective
again
there
many
caveats

note
my
usage
of
my

is
an

i
dont

a

not
that
there
is
no
truth
about
morality
to
have
a

youre
admitting
a
lot
more
than
that
you
are
admitting
that
your

are
situational
you
are
admitting
that
the
actions
of
other
people
and
the
situation
you
are
in
help
to
determine
how
you
judge
the
moral
significance
of
one
of
your
own
actions
if
you
employ
x
degree
of

thats
not
moral

if
you
employ
x
degree
of
force
but
previously
someone
else
has
employed
y
degree
of

and
the
situation
is
thusandso
that
is
moral
this
is
quite
different
from
saying
employing
force
on
other
people
is
immoral
period
unfortunately
from
time
to
time
we
are
obliged
to
do
this
immoral
thing
for
reasons
of
selfpreservation
and
so
we
have
to
bear
the
moral
consequences
of
that
for
what
its
worth
and
yes
i
know
you
claim
to
be
an
agnostic
its
this
ability
to
relabel

that
i

has
been

always
played

when

its
not

its
just
a

i
have
often
tried
to
explain
this
to
some
close

who
believe
the

that
islam
is
somehow
tied

often
times
you
hear

they
just
dont

we

so

was

anyone
out

had

it

have

spoken
the

suppose
that
you
said
in
the
assembly
of
a
ruler
while
being
observed
by
him
the
true
ruler
has
appointed
me
to
such
and
such
position
at
a
time
when
you
were
asked
to
prove
your
claim
the
word
yes
uttered
by
the
ruler
would
sufficiently
support
you
or
if
the
ruler
changed
his
usual
practice
and
attitude
at
your
request
this
would
confirm
your
claim
even
more
soundly
and
more
definitely
than
would
the
word
yes
in
the
same
way
allahs
most
noble
messenger
claimed
i
am
the
envoy
of
the
creator
of
this

my
proof
is
that
he
will
change
his
unbroken
order
at
my
request
and
my
prayer
now
look
at
my
fingers
he
makes
them
run
like
a
fountain
with
five
spigots
look
at
the
moon
by
a
gesture
of
my
finger
he
splits
it
in
two
look
at
that
tree
to
affirm
me
and
to
bear
witness
to
me
it
moves
and
comes
near

me
look
at
this
food
although
it
is
barely
enough
for
two
or
three
men
it
satisfies
two
or
three
hundred
further
he
shows
hundreds
of
similar
miracles
however
the
evidences
of
the
veracity
of
this
high
being
and
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
are
not
restricted
to
his
miracles
all
his
deeds
and
acts
his
words
and
behavior
his
moral
conduct
and
manners
his
character
and
appearance
prove
to
the
attentive
his
truthfulness
and
seriousness
indeed
many
people
such
as
abdullah
b
salam
the
famous
scholar
of
the
children
of
israel
came
to
belief
merely
by
seeing
him
and
said
no
lie
can
hide
in
this
face
nor
can
any
fraud
be
found
in
it
although
many
of
the
researchers
have
concluded
that
the
proofs
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
and
his
miracles
number
about
one
thousand
there
are
thousands
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
of
proofs
of
his
prophethood
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
truthseeking
men
muhakkikiin
with
varying
opinions
have
affirmed
his
prophethood
in
an
equal
number
of
ways
the
wise
ouran
alone
demonstrates
thousands
of
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
in
addition
to
its
own
forty
aspects
of
miraculousness
since
prophethood
is
as
a
phenomenon
of
humanity
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals
who
claimed
prophethood
and
performed
miracles
have
lived
and
passed
away
then
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
saw
is
of
a
certanity
superior
to
that
of
the
prophethood
of
all
the
others
for

as
jesus
as
and
moses
as
they
are
all
owned

since
the
causes

bill
i
have
taken
the
time
to
explain
that
biblical

consider
the
josephus
reference
to
be
an
early
christian
insert
by
biblical
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
research
is
willing
to
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
this
excludes
literalists
who
may
otherwise
be
defined
as
biblical
apologists
they
find
what
they
want
to
find
they
are
not
trustworthy
by
scholarly
standards
and
others
why
an
insert
read
it
i
have
a
number
of
times
the
passage
is
glaringly
out
of
context
and
josephus
a
superb
writer
had
no
such
problem
elsewhere
in
his
work
the
passage
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
matter
in
which
it
lies
it
suddenly
appears
and
then
just
as
quickly
disappears
i
think
this
is
a
weak
argument
the
fact
is
there
are
two
references
to
jesus
in
antiquities
of
the
jews
one
of
which
has
unquestionably
at
least
been
altered
by
christians
origen
wrote
in
the
third
century
that
josephus
did
not
recognize
jesus
as
the
messiah
while
the
long
passage
says
the
opposite
there
is
an
arabic
manuscript
of
antiquities
of
the
jews
which
contains
a
version
of
the
passage
which
is
much
less
gungho
for
jesus
and
may
be
authentic
there
is
no
question
that
origen
in
the
third
century
saw
a
reference
to
jesus
in
josephus
there
are
no
manuscripts
of
antiquities
which
lack
the
references
it
is
possible
that
it
was
fabricated
out
of
whole
cloth
and
inserted
but
i
dont
think
its
very
likelynor
do
i
think
there
is
a
consensus
in
the
scholarly
community
that
this
is
the
case
i
know
ga
wells
takes
this
position
but
thats
because
he
takes
the
very
small
minority
view
that
jesus
never
existed
and
he
is
a
professor
of
german
not
of
biblical
history
or
new
testament
or
anything
directly
relevant
to
the
historicity

the
trouble
with
trying

find

the

is
that

and
his

were
accused
of
being
flaming
faggots
one
of
the
pretexts
for
the
night
of
long
knives
in
which
roehm
and
most
of
the
sa
wing
of
the
nsdap
were
purged
stop
hold
it
you
have
a
few
problems
here
official
history
says
that
the
first
accusations
of
homosexuality
in
the
sa
came
from
outside
of
the
nazi
party
long
before
the
nazis
ever
came
to
power
so
this
objection
is
a
red
herring
even
if
established
history
is
wrong
on
this
point
moreover
none
of
the
histories
ive
read
ever
made
mention
of
hitler
or
anyone
else
ever
using
homosexuality
as
a
pretext
for
purging
roehm
a
point
i
saw
reiterated
was
that
hitler
and
the
party
covered
up
these
accusations
if
you
are
going
to
accuse
official
history
of
being
a
fabrication
you
should
at
least
get
your
facts
right
the
pretext
for
purging
roehm
was
that
he
was
planning
to
use
the
sa
in
a
coup
against
hitler
nowhere
is
there
mention
of
using
allegations
of
homosexuality
as
a
pretext
for
the
purge
nor
as
a
justification
afterwards
it
is
possible
that
the
histories
ive
read
have
not
mentioned
this
but
i
doubt
it
would
it
be
in
hitlers
best
interest
to
admit
to
the
world
that
his
former
right
hand
man
was
a
homosexual
anyway
as
i
said
before
it
is
always
possible
that
i
have
missed
references
to
the
nazis
making
use
of
charges
of
homosexuality
against
the
sa
after
the
night
of
the
long
knives
but
this
does
not
prove
that
they
were
false
even
the
nazis
could
tell
the
truth
when
it
was
to
their
advantage
in
any
case
this
does
not
deal
with
accusations
of
homosexuality
in
the
sa
during
the
since
the
accusers
thereafter
controlled
the
records
anything
bearing
on
the
subject
true
or
not
has
to
be
considered
tainted
evidence
ah
yes
i
forgot
this
was
being
posted
to
altconspiracy
i
can
smell
the
paranoia
from
here
since
the
nazis
never
officially
charged
roehm
with
homosexuality
at
least
not
according
to
what
ive
read
id
like
to
know
what
tainted
evidence
you
are
talking
about
since
the
accusations
were
made
by
persons
outside
of
the
nazi
party
long
before
it
came
to
power
and
those
accusations
were
common
knowledge
to
journalists
and
others
in
germany
in
the
and
just
how
would
it
be
possible
for
the
nazis
to
go
back
in
time
and
plant
tainted
evidence
how
exactly
does
one
doctor
newspapers
which
were
circulated
around
the
world
without
the
discrepancies
being
obvious
what
actual
incidences
of
nazi
doctoring
evidence
on
this
matter
do
you
know
about
and
what
about
the
testimony
of
people
who
were
involved
in
these
matters
some
of
whom
were
not
nazis
and
what
is
the
point
of
making
a
false
accusation
of
homosexuality
if
you
do
not
publicize
it
since
the
point
here
seems
to
be
to
discredit
established
history
then
the
burden
of
proof
falls
on
the
revisionist
the
revisionists
had
better
do
their
homework
before
making
accusations
otherwise
they
simply
look
like
conspiracy
nuts
the
available
data
suggest
that
roehm
and
his
crowd
the
sa
sturmabteilung
storm
troopers
left
the
world
a
better
place
when
they
departed
this
is
just
about
the
only
thing
we
agree
on
i
suspect
that
the
notion
that
there
might
have
been
bad
people
roehm
and
his
sa
buddies
who
were
homosexuals
must
disturb
some
people
the
feeling
seems
to
be
that
if
a
nasty
individual
is
accused
of
homosexuality
that
this
must
be
an
attempt
to
bash
homosexuals
this
fear
often
justified
is
what
lies
behind
this
distrust
of
official
history
or
so
it
seems
to
me
but
this
is
not
a
good
justification
for
trashing
accepted
accounts
of
this
subject
if
you
really
think
that
historians
are
so
incompetent
why
dont
you
write
them
and
ask
where
they
got
their
sources
on
this
subject
if
you
cant
tell
from
their
footnotes
im
a
graduate
student
in
history
writing
to
professors
and
tracking
down
sources
is
old
hat
but
my
time
is
limited
and
this
is
not
my
specialty
and
neither
you
nor
anyone
else
have
said
anything
that
would
cast
one
shred
of
doubt
on
existing
evidence
im
not
going
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
debunk
someones
paranoia
do
the
research
yourself
but
concrete
particulars
are
still
no
more
than
more
or
less
shrewd
guesses
diccon
frankborn
given
that
you
already
consider
all
evidence
tainted
what
on
earth
would
constitute
concrete
particulars
and
since
when
have
concrete
particulars
been
considered
shrewd
guesses
i
suggest
that
those
who
do
not
trust
popular
historians
irving
et
al
historians
writing
for
a
popular
audience
do
not
as

provide

of
personal
position
jesus
and
the
law
sandviknewtonapplecom

sandvik
writes
my
online
bible
is
on
a
cd
but
i
dont
own
a
cdrom
system
for
the
time
being
so
i
cant
search
for
the
famous
cite
where
jesus
explicitly
states
that
he
didnt
want
to
break
existing
jewish
laws
in
other
words
technically
speaking
christians
should
use
saturday
and
not
sunday
as
their
holy
day
if
they
want
to
conform
to
the
teachings
of
jesus
i
think
the
passage
youre
looking
for
is
the
following
matthew
think
not
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
and
the
prophets
i
have
come
not
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfil
them
matthew
for
truly
i
say
to
you
till
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
an
iota
not
a
dot
will
pass
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
matthew
whoever
then
relaxes
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
men
so
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
who
does
them
and
teaches
them
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
matthew
for
i
tell
you
unless
your
righteousness
exceeds
that
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
you
will
never
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
there
are
several
problems
with
this
the
most
serious
is
that
the
law
was
regarded
by
jews
at
the
time
and
now
as
binding
on
jews
but
not
on
gentiles
there
are
rules
that
were
binding
on
all
human
beings
the
socalled
noachic
laws
but
they
are
quite
minimal
the
issue
that
the
church
had
to
face
after
jesus
death
was
what
to
do
about
gentiles
who
wanted
to
follow
christ
the
decision
not
to
impose
the
law
on
them
didnt
say
that
the
law
was
abolished
it
simply
acknowledged
that
fact
that
it
didnt
apply
to
gentiles
this
is
a
simple
answer
which
i
think
just
about
everyone
can
agree
to
a
discussion
of
the
issue
in
more
or
less
these
terms
is
recorded
in
acts
however
theres
more
involved
in
order
to
get
a
full
picture
of
the
role
of
the
law
we
have
to
come
to
grips
with
pauls
apparent
rejection
of
the
law
and
how
that
relates
to
jesus
commendation
of
the
law
at
least
as
i
read
paul
he
says
that
the
law
serves
a
purpose
that
has
been
in
a
certain
sense
superceded
again
this
issue
isnt
one
of
the
abolition
of
the
law
in
the
middle
of
his
discussion
paul
notes
that
he
might
be
understood
this
way
and
assures
us
that
thats
not
what
he
intends
to
say
rather
he
sees
the
law
as
primarily
being
present
to
convict
people
of
their
sinfulness
but
ultimately
its
an
impossible
standard
and
one
that
has
been
superceded
by
christ
pauls
comments
are
not
the
worlds
clearest
here
and
not
everyone
agrees
with
my
reading
but
the
interesting
thing
to
notice
is
that
even
this
radical
position
does
not
entail
an
abolition
of
the
law
it
still
remains
as
an
uncompromising
standard
from
which
not
an
iota
or
dot
may
be
removed
for
its
purpose
of
convicting
of
sin
its
important
that
it
not
be
relaxed
however
for
christians
its
not
the
end
ultimately
we
live
in
faith
not
law
while
the
theoretical
categories
they
use
are
rather
different
in
the
end
i
think
jesus
and
paul
come
to
a
rather
similar
conclusion
the
quoted
passage
from
mat
should
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
rest
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
where
jesus
shows
us
how
he
interprets
the
law
the
not
an
iota
or
dot
would
suggest
a
rather
literal
reading
but
in
fact
thats
not
jesus
approach
jesus
interpretations
emphasize
the
intent
of
the
law
and
stay
away
from
the
ceremonial
details
indeed
he
is
well
known
for
taking
a
rather
free
attitude
towards
the
sabbath
and
kosher
laws
some
scholars
claim
that
mat
needs
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
cent
jewish
discussions
jesus
accuses
his
opponents
of
caring
about
giving
a
tenth
of
even
the
most
minor
herbs
but
neglecting
the
things
that
really
matter
justice
mercy
and
faith
and
caring
about
how
cups
and
plates
are
cleaned
but
not
about
the
fact
that
inside
the
people
who
use
them
are
full
of
extortion
and
rapacity
mat
this
and
the
discussion
later
in
mat
suggest
that
jesus
has
a
very
specific
view
of
the
law
in
mind
and
that
when
he
talks
about
maintaining
the
law
in
its
full
strength
he
is
thinking
of
these
aspects
of
it
pauls
conclusion
is
similar
while
he
talks
about
the
law
being
superceded
all
of
the
specific
examples
he
gives
involve
the
ceremonial
law
such
as
circumcision
and
the
sabbath
he
is
quite
concerned
about
maintaining
moral
standards
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
when
paul
talks
about
the
law
being
superceded
and
jesus
talks
about
the
law
being
maintained
i
believe
they
are
talking
about
different
aspects
of
the
law
paul
is
embroiled
in
arguments
about
circumcision
as
is
natural
in
letters
responding
to
specific
situations
hes
looking
at
the
aspect
of
the
law
that
is
currently
causing
trouble
the
law
as
specifically
jewish
ceremonies
he
certainly
does
not
intend
to
abolish
divine
standards
of
conduct
on
the
other
hand
when
jesus
commends
the
law
he
seems
to
be
talking
the
law
in
its
broadest
implications
for

and

relationships
and
deemphasizing
those
aspects
that
were
later
to
give
paul
so
much
trouble
its
unfortunate
that
people
use
the
same
terms
in
different
ways
but
we
should
be
familiar
with
that
from
current
conflicts
look
at
the
way
terms
like
family
values
take
on
special
meaning
from
the
current
context
imagine
some
poor
historian
of
the
future
trying
to
figure
out
why
family
values
should
be
used
as
a
code
word
for
opposition
to
homosexuality
in
one
specific
period
in
the
us
i
think
law
had
taken
on
a
similar
role
in
the
arguments
paul
was
involved
in
paul
was
clearly
not
rejecting
all
of
the
jewish
values
that
go
along
with
the
term
law
any
more
than
people
who
concerned
about
the
family

movement
are

just

i
recall
reading
in
michael
rutherfords
novel
sarum
a
scene
in
which
the
son
of
a
roman
nobleman
living
in
britain
takes
part
in
a
secret
ceremony
involving
a
bull
he
stands
naked
in
a
pit
covered
with
some
sort
of
scaffolding
while
assistants
coax
a
bull
to
stand
on
the
scaffolding
they
then
fatally
stab
the
bull
which
douses
the
worshipper
in
the
pit
with
blood
this
is
supposedly
some
sort
of
rite
of
passage
for
members
of
the
bull
cult
i
wonder
if
this
is
related
to
the
mithras
cult
yes
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
traditional
ideas
about
the
mithraic
cult
although
not
the
only
one
it
had
many
elements
that
seem
to
have
been
borrowed
by
catholicism
eg
the
mass
communion
the
sharing
of
a
sacred
meal
consecration
of
bread
and
wine
etc
for
quite
an
amusing
novel
that
uses
this
same
idea
check
out
the
covenant
of
the
flame
by
david
morrell
it
has
some
quite
interesting
occult
bits
and
lots
of
killing
i
wont
spoil
it
by
revealing
the
ending
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
relevant

tony
i
read
your
post
it
was
nothing
new
i
had
seen
much
the
same
in
other
typicalchristian
antigay
sentimental
literature
gay
people
are
and
will
con
tinue
to
be
persecuted
as
long
as
such
propaganda
petpetuates
you
may
be
unaware
of
all
the
statistica
findings
concerning
africanamericans
that
have
been
published
and
used
by
various
groups
to
reenforce
their
own
bias
against
africanamericans
we
usually
think
of
the
kkk
in
these
instances
but
there
are
many
other
groups
of
course
the
vast
majority
of
the
public
scoff
at
such
findings
and
documents
today
but
that
was
not
always
the
case
fortunately
africanamericans
had
whites
who
supported
their
cause
and
public
sentiment
was
eventually
if
not
entirely
turned
around
there
was
even
a
civil
war
and
antinegro
sentiment
increased
in
fact
until
laws
were
put
in
place
to
protect
the
inalienable
rights
of
blacks
it
was
pretty
much
legal
to
discriminate
against
them
i
know
many
gays
and
i
will
not
turn
my
back
on
them
or
their
right
to
be
free
form
discrimination
you
may
think
that
i
have
been
deceived
or
something
that
is
your
perogative
my
church
christian
church
disciples
of
christ
openly
affirms
the
rights
of
oppressed
people
of
all
segments
of
society
including
gays
we
believe
the
gospel
message
of
preaching
to
all
creation
and
making
disciples
we
believe
in
the
lords
great
commandment
to
love
and
we
beleive
in
standing
up
for
the
oppressed
even
if
it
is
not
popular
to
do
so
i
really
like
my
church
for
last
reason
the
most
i
can
find
a
church
almost
anywhere
in
the
valley
that
stands
for
the
gospel
and
believes
in
the
commandment
of
love
though
im
hardpressed
to
find
many
who
actually
sho
love
but
not
many
are
willing
to
champion
the
oppressed
especially
within
their
own
community
i
may
have
lost
face
with
the
greater
christian
community
for
the
unpopularity
of
my
beliefs
but
so
did
the
abolitionists
against
the
oppression
of
africanamericans
many
were
even
killed
and
treated
as
runaway
slaves
for
being
niggerlovers
and
such
i
guess
ive
decided
the
challenge
is
worth
it
in
my
talks
with
gay
men
and
women
i
have
heard
tragic
story
after
tragic
story
centering
around
failed
marriages
wives
and
husbands
who
are
straight
who
have
been
hurt
in
the
process
etc
funny
thing
is
i
dont
know
of
one
case
where
the
parents
exwives
or
even
children
have
continued
to
reject
their
gay
family
member
son
daughter
exhusband
father
etc
after
they
began
to
take
part
in
some
form
of
support
group
like
pflag
im
apalled
by
the
legislation
which
passed
in
colorado
and
am
equally
raged
that
such
slimey
people
as
louis
sheldon
from
the
tradition
values
coalition
have
been
actively
working
in
the
christian
underground
to
garner
support
within
several
i
believe
states
this
coming
november
for
more
oppressive
legisation
against
gays
perhaps
you
dont
get
it
and
maybe
you
never
will
many
didnt
get
it
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
proclaimed
gods
will
be
done
as
they
massacred
thousands
in
witch
hunts
and
inquisitions
the
message
that
comes
through
loud
and
clear
by
proponents
against
gay
rights
and
against
gays
in
general
is
that
there
is
a
strong
dislike
even
hatred
for
gays
whether
you
want
to
call
it
such
or
not
it
doesnt
change
the
results
the
major
flaw
in
all
this
posturing
is
that
in
the
end
the
final
effect
of
posts
like
that
of
yours
and
mr
hudson
is
that
you
have
a
conditional
love
for
gays
condition
change
and
well
love
you
this
is
sure
strange
coming
from
a
group
who
claim
that
god
has
an
unconditional
love
one
that
calls
people
just
as
they
are
sure
there
are
things
that
will
naturally
change
and
habits
like
alcoholism
wife
beating
etc
that
need
to
be
changed
through
some
sort
of
therapy
but
then
there
are
things
like
lefthandedness
etc
that
no
amount
of
beating
it
out
of
people
is
going
to
result
in
anything
more
than
an
outward
conforminty
to
other
peoples
expectations
in
the
process
this
coerced
conformity
causes
many
people
a
great
deal
of
harm
especially
when
it
is
caused
by
people
who
have
nothing
more
to
gain
from
it
that
to
become
even
more
puffed
up
about
their
own
sense
of
pseuperspirituality
this
is
sad
but
i
thoroughly
believe
that
one
day
it
will
change
it
may
be
unpopular
to
cry
for
justice
and
equality
when
the
basis
has
to
do
with
something
very
personal
like
sexuality
a
taboo
subject
even
today
but
i
firmly
believe
in
the
rights
of
individuals
to
be
free
from
impose
regulation
on
thier
bedrooms
its
funny
that
most
straight
people
have
successfully
removed
restrictive
and
oppressive
legislation
against
invasive
legislation
but
we
like
to
maintain
this
little
chestnut
of
repressionas
though
it
helps
us
maintain
a
sense
of
superiority
over
at
least
one
segment
of
society
gay
people
are
not
criminals
another
interesting
thing
happened
recently
a
very
prominent
charismatic
church
in
the
silicon
valley
here
had
two
of
its
pastors
arrested
for
self
admitted
charges
of
pederasty
men
having
sex
with
boys
this
had
apparently
been
going
on
for
some
time
a
couple
years
but
since
the
charges
were
voluntary
and
the
church
worked
closely
with
the
police
so
i
imagine
that
was
how
they
managed
to
downplay
it
in
the
media
how
could
such
a
thing
happen
when
the
church
itself
has
an
exgay
ministry
one
of
my
friends
recently
told
me
he
was
approached
by
someone
who
is
going
through
the
reparitive
therapy
there
and
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
request
for
dinner
was
not
an
invitation
to
attend
the
ministry
these
are
difficult
times
we
live
in
but
providing
hostile
environments
and
creating
and
perpetuating
an
atmosphere
that
breed
hate
and
violence
is
not
the
call
of
the
christian
community
the
results
of
the
passing
amendment
in
colorado
has
created
an
organization
whos
posters
are
appearing
all
over
colorado
called
straight
i
forget
the
whole
definition
off
hand
but
the
last
part
was
against
immoral
gross
homosexual
trash
and
their
motto
is
working
for
a
fagfree
america
with
an
implicit
advocation
for
violence
this
is
sick
and
it
seems
to
be
what
you
and
mr
hudson
and
others
are
embracing
we
christians
have
a
loooooooooong
tradition
of
coersion
and
oppression
towards
those
we
feel
dont
measure
up
and
constant
beratement
from
organizations
like
the
christian
research
institute
while
they
do
have
a
good
purpose
also
their
major
work
seems
to
be
finding
new
and
better
ways
of
excluding
people
the
gospel
i
believe
is
not
so
negative
rather
it
seeks
ways
to
include
people
i
have
several
of
dr
martins
books
and
find
them
quite
helpful
especially
concerning
cults
but
it
seems
that
cri
has
become
a
cult
unto
itself
why
dont
we
just
stick
to
the
positive
and
find
ways
to
bring
people
to
jesus
istead
of
taking
bullwhips

such
i

decided
the

this
sounds
real
nice

struck
me
as
a
little
odd
youre
presenting
yourself
as

xian
who
is
sticking
his
neck
out
and
taking
on
the
challenge
of
speaking
out
in

in

but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
you
yourself
are
gay
thats
all
well
and
fine
but
presenting
yourself
as
sticking
out
your
neck
to
help
repressed
others
seems
a

untruthful

kelvin
i

ive
been
taught
all
about
it
in
sunday
school
catechism
class
and
theology
classes
but
even
after
all
that
i
still
cant
accept
it
maybe
im
still
not
understanding
it
or
maybe
im
just
understanding
it
all
too
well
then
as
you
understand
it
what
is
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
know
that
the
punishment
of
an
innocent
man
is
wrong
yes
i
agree
with
that
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
jesus
punishment
you
say
jesus
did
not
regard
his
death
as
punishment
ive
tried
repeatedly
over
the
course
of
several
years
to
accept
it
but
i
just
cant
good
i
wouldnt
eithernot
the
way
you
understand
it
if
you
can
explain

why
the
death
of

was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me
ask
jesus
himself
he
himself
said
why
in
john
it
isnt
a
mystery
to
anyone
and
there
certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the
world
cannot
accept
him
because
it
neither
sees
him
nor
knows
him
john
the
animosity

the
lack

that
comes

in
your

is
very
convincing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
john
and
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animosity
and
lack

i
am
not
perfect
either

regardless

that

that

if

i

impartial

made
a
doozy

i

that

on

hand
if

it

more
likely
that

deception
in

books
why
should
he
be

just

so
archer
is
just
sitting
around
rubbing
his

plotting
how
next
to
deceive
ok
lets

the
list
this
was
an
open
question
i
assumed
that
if
mr

is
a
chronic
liar
someone
whould
have

it
this
assumption
is
based
on
how
talkorigins

deceptions
such

guish

i
derive
that

is
there
such
a

as
catholic
erotica
not
necessarily
a

story
between
people
of

faith

a
love
story
that
is
not
exploitative
does
not
seek
redemption
through
penis
size
pays
proper
respect
to
the
dignity
of
each

and
is
still
erotic
enough
to
have

i
would
submit

cut
down

actually
agree
with

that
nearly
all

got

i
shot

all

i
count

which
makes
my

lower

have

we
may
serve

acceptably

and
to
you
who
are

when
the

shall
be

from

with

in
flaming

taking

on

that

when
he
shall
come
to
be
glorified
in

and
to
be
admired
in
all
them
that
believe
because
our
testimony
among
you
was
believed
in
that
day
kinda
gives
flaming
a
whole
new
meaning
i
reckon
the
impression
i
got
from
talking
with
livingston
was
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
powerwise
is
going
to
be
something
that
those
who
are
unprepared
cant
handle
kinda
like
overloading
a
fuse
due
to
guilt
somehow
it
seems
to
also
apply
to
the
entire
physical
world
as
we
know
it
lf
suggests
that
god
doesnt
want
that
and
has
sent
koresh
as
a
reminder
seems
that
those
who
have
been
purified
through
salvation
or
that
those
protected
by
the
seals
will
be
the
ones
who
survive
and
no
i
dont
have
a
good
idea
yet
what
being
shielded
by
the
seals
actually
involves
or
how
exactly
it
relates
to
salvation
other
than
it
involves
the
marriage
of
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
for
those
of
you
biblical
well
versed
me
personally
im
totally
dependent
on
god
through
christ
so
if
god
wants
me
to
understand
good
if
not
also
good
if
god
wants
to
save
me
or
dispose
of
me
thats
great
either
way
being
born
in
the
spirit
means
being
part
of
the
body
of
christ
ephesians
so
who
and
what
i
was
matters
little
whats
important
is
loving
god
come
nova
nuke
or
apocalypse
who
cares
satan
might
even
be
able
to
pull
off
a
pretty
convincing
fake
big
deal
not
worth
fearing
or
worrying
about
though
not
before
the
greater
glory
of
god
maybe
koresh
is
right
maybe
he
isnt
and
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
the
new
message
or
prophecy
the
tour
of
the
bible
ive
taken
in
studying
the
passages
he
points
to
in

has
been
most
re
warding
but
the
test
of
prophecy
is
still
the
fruit
it
bears
which
is
not
yet
clear
much
much
more
important
is
charity
which
by
definition
is
love
for
god
i
hope
dear

youve
taken
all
this

good
question
my
point
was
that
a

with

is
better
than
a
world
with
falsehood
a
world
in
which
it
were
possible
to
say
yes

am
holding

the

and
you
me
the

better
than
the
grim
alternatives
you
present
obviously
this
is
not
possible
and
the
best
alternative
seems
to
be
to
lie
thats
because
other
values
are
involved
such
as
life
now
that
is
just
my
opinion
dont
confuse
the
claim
objective
morality
exists
with
the
claim
i
have
a
lock
on
morals
i
think
that
at
this
point
it
would
actually
be
quite
easy
to
confuse
objective
morality
with
relative
morality
jon
actually
jon
that
is
quite
true
christian
people
have
caused
objective
morality
to
look
very
relative
after
all
that
was
the
point
of
the
original
question
in
this
thread
ie
can
we
toss
out
christianity
because
it
is
so
obviously
inconsistent
with
its
own
principles
if
you
will
bear
with
me
i
will
attempt
to
explain
this
apparent
inconsistency
from
at
least
one
christians
viewpoint
if
god
exists
and
is
the
creator
of
mankind
as
the
bible
claims
then
he
has
a
pretty
welldefined
concept
of
what
makes
people
tick
physically
emotionally
etc
god
has
an
objective
morality
for
us
that
is
to
say
he
has
no
trouble
understanding
what
is
good
for
or
detrimental
to
the
creature
he
created
galatians
for
we
mankind
are
his
workmanship
created
in
christ
jesus
for
good
works
a
morality
which
god
prepared
beforehand
a
welldefined
design
that
we
might
walk
in
them
however
contrary
to
what
many
people
assume
including
the
pharasees
of
the
bible
gods
morality
cannot
be
completely
codified
in
a
list
of
rules
and
regulations
to
some
extent
every
activity
of
a
persons
life
creates
a
new
situation
to
which
morality
must
be
applied
there
never
could
be
enough
volumes
to
codify
gods
objective
morality
for
us
throughout
history
mankind
has
tried
to
reduce
morality
to
a
list
of
rules
objectivity
if
you
please
in
the
old
testament
we
have
both
principles
and
specific
rules
by
the
time
of
jesus
most
of
the
principles
were
obscured
by
the
emphasis
men
had
placed
on
the
rules
volumes
of
additional
rules
had
been
made
to
try
to
codify
the
application
of
the
principles
we
mankind
werent
comfortable
with
the
subjectivity
of
principles
for
reference
see
matthew
where
jesus
explains
the
difference
between
the
law
and
the
principles
of
the
law
for
example
in
verses
you
have
heard
that
the
ancients
were
told
you
shall
not
commit
murderand
whoever
commits
murder
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
but
i
say
to
you
that
everyone
who
is
angry
with
his
brother
shall
be
liable
to
the
court
the
objective
morality
of
god
gets
blurred
by
our
inept
interpretation
of
it
we
christians
have
made
our
biggest
errors
when
we
have
allowed
any
one
person
or
group
of
people
decide
exactly
what
god
intended
for
us
if
we
christians
would
stay
committed
to
seeking
gods
will
instead
of
trying
to
prove
we
already
had
it
all
figured
out
we
might
do
a
better
job
of
allowing
others
to
find
gods
objective
morality
for
themselves
if
jesus
is
who
he
said
he
wasis
and
thats
the
fundamental
question
then

is

if
i
take

he
cannot

because
they
were
also
following

as
they
understood
them
if
you
misread
i
can
do
and
have
repeatedly
done
a

bill
of
accusation
against

by
exhibiting
in

thorough
a
form
as
anyone
might

has

human

alone
love

in

succession
please
go
back
to
my
quoted
words
above
the
possibility
that
always
exists
is
that
i
or
to
revert
to
proper
time
sequence
my
predecessors
over
the
last
several
centuries
could
persuade
christian
b
of
my
case
that
the
inquisition
does
indeed
constitute
an
egregious
violation
of
the
law
of
love
i
must
also
note
that
the
majority
of
christians
have
been
so
persuaded
by
christian
argumentation
as
well
as
by
secular
both
christian
and
nonchristian
prohibitions
what
mr

is
a
trickier
point
a
i
demonstrate
the
human
pain
and

has
failed
but
the
point
i
am
making
is
sustained
what
is
going
on
here
has
a
lot
to
do
with
cultural
baggage
in
this
case
the
baggage
includes
a
nearly
universal
and
absolutely
secular
belief
that
an
accused
person
must
prove
innocence
and
that
testimony
is
most
believable
if
taken
under
torture
the
elimination
of
inqisitorial
practice
in
those
places
where
it
has
been
eliminated
or
at
least
greatly
reduced
has
very
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
discussion
of
sin
in
the
exchange
between
a
and
b
mr
turpin
is
pointing
out
that
if
i
am
a
versus
the
grand
inquisitors
b
then
my
persuasion
is
not
very
likely
to
work
i
know
this
and
in
what
ever
personal
agony
i
consign
the
issue
to
god
and
my
ghostly
defense
attorney
so
one
possibility
fails
in
this
case
as
it
will
fail
in
may
others
at
the
other
extreme
the
persuasion
will
succeed
when
it
properly
should
not
if
it
entails
mistaken
assumptions
i
share
with
the
inquisitor
and
that
is
potentially
an
even
more
troubling
case
in
that
many
of
the
victims
of
inquisition
will
have
accepted
that
they
were
in
fact
sinful
in
such
random
cases
as
they
may
actually
have
been
guilty
of
charges
brought
against
them
the
point
is
that
the
persuasion
breaks
down
when
the
parties
do
not
share
enough
to
agree
on
all
the
cultural
baggage
and
given
the
main
thrust
of
the
inquisition
against
heresy
it
is
bound
to
break
down
in
precisely
the
worst
cases
the
conservative
i
dont
think
that
is
the
right
word
btw
will
take
refuge
in
what
i
attribute
to
b
above
that
he
is
justified
in
causing
harm
because
he
thinks
that
works
to
a
greater
good
but
this
is
a
violent
and
extravagant
refusal
to
follow
the
gospel
as
if
ones
theories
about
sin
entitled
one
to
cast
aside
jesus
words
on
dealing
with
sinners
cf
matthew
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
seriously
or
for
that
matter
what
does
it
mean
to
love
ones
fellow
man
and
what
is
the
right
thing
and
how
does
one
go
about
loving
god
well
the
whole
point
of
making
these
the
base
commandments
is
that
they
arent
reducible
to
rules
a
set
of
rules
is
a
moral
code
or
a
law
code
or
an
algorithm
for
acting
such
things
can
be
very
helpful
to
individuals
or
societies
but
not
if
they
are
used
instead
of
a
personal
involvement
in
and
responsibility
for
ones
actions
the
great
commandment
is
more
than
anything
else
a
call
to
act
as
if
you
were
god
and
accepting
ultimate
responsibility
in
your
every
action
a
demand
that
i
like
most
would
rather
not
hear
but
it
keeps
popping
up
nonetheless
along
with
the
reassurance
that
it
is
more
important
that
i
be
open
to
trying
this
than
succeeding
at
it
conservatives
may
twist
this
act
as
if
you
were
god
to
mean
lay
down
rules
for
other
people
and
be
as
nasty
to
them
as
possible
if
they
dont
keep
your
rules
they
are
so
insistent
and
obvious
about
this
that
they
have
convinced
a
lot
of
people
who
rightly
reject
the
whole
concept
that
such
idiocy
is
how
god
acts
that
after
all
is
the
standard
accusation
against
god
by
the
atheists
here
and
elsewhere
that
the
conservatives
have
confused
their
manipulative
hoopjumping
notions
of
coercing
other
people
with
the
nature
of
god
is
almost
the
entire
content
of
standard
american
atheism
and
i
quite
agree
with
it
on
this
point
ethical
systems
are
not
differentiated
by
the
nice
sounding
goo
up
front
much
of
which
sounds
pretty
much
the
same
but
by
the
specific
acts
procedures
and
arguments
that
they
recommend
and
different
bodies
of
christians
have
from
the
beginning
urged
different
ethical
systems
or
in
some
cases
none
as
a
result
it
is
bizarre
to
identify
any
one
of
these
systems
however
popular
or
infamous
with
christianity
christianity
does
not
have
a
torah
it
does
not
have
a
quran
specifically
christian
scripture
has
very
little
if
anything
in
the
way
of
commandments
so
little
that
the
christians
who
desperately
want
commandments
go
mining
for
them
with
almost
no
support
and
thus
almost
no
obvious
limitation
for
their
efforts
the
one
single
thing
in
the
gospels
which
jesus
specifically
gives
as
a
commandment
to
us
is
love
one
another
i
will
be
expanding
on
this
point
in
a
reply
to
paul
hudson
that
i
hope
to
get
to
in
a
day
or
so
it
is
quite
true
that
some
christians
infer
lots
of
commandments
from
the
nt
ill
point
out
what
has
to
be
going
on
in
these
inferences
and
why
there
is
a
huge
amount
of
cultural
baggage
involved
you
are
quite
right
that
this
is
goo
if
one
is
looking
for
an
ethical
system
but
why
should
anyone
be
looking
for
an
ethical
system
since
our
society
is
eager
to
hand
us
one
or
more
no
matter
what
we
do
it
may
be
that
we
need
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
in
which
case
i
will
profer
the
agapate
allelou
once
again
i
am
glad
that
a
few
christians
such
as
michael
find
a
benign
meaning
for
the
goo
and
then
interpret
the
usually
ugly
specifics
in
a
more
constructive
fashion
on
the
other
hand
i
do
think
that
this
tells
us
more
about
michael
and
christians
like
him
that
it
tells
us
about
christianity
i
think
you
are
begging
the
question
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
tell
you
something
about
christianity
nor
is
this
very
new
in
christianity
you
might
want
to
look
up
the
origins
and
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
quakers
from

onwards
and
they
are

so
i
have
reevaluated

its
also
contributed
to
my
decision
so
most
biblestudying
christians
wont
be
convinced
by
my
arguments
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
good
thing
i
presume
where
does
this
most
bible
studying
christians
think
as
frank
does
come
from
and
what
implied
good
are
you
doing

at

some
of

that
you
may

more
harm

good
to
your

btw
i
used
to
think
like
frank
does
i
went
to
a
fundamentalist
church
for
a
while
i
didnt
start
to
really
think
about
what
they
were
saying
until
i
noticed
a
gods
science
phamphlet
there
i
read
it
and
noticed
that
the
authors
of
it
knew
virtually
nothing
about
science
i
asked
church
members
some
questions
about
theories
from
the
phamphlet
and
got
only
deceptive
answers
i
began
to
notice
a
very
similar
style
of
answers
for
theological
questions
as
well
the
only
conclusion
i
could
reach
was
that
these
peoples
beliefs
about
the
bible
were
about
as
valid
as
their
beliefs
in
their
gods
science
phamphlet
if
there
are
still
people
out
there
who
think
that
my
purpose
here
is
to
attack
the
bible
an
accusation
frank
once
made
i
would
point
out
that
i
have
also
criticized
people
who
have
posted
bible
contradictions
that
turn
out
to
be
silly
out
of
context
or
easily
and
legitimately
reconciled
im
not
attacking
the
bible
but
intellectual
dishonesty
about
the
bible
from
either
side
if
one
of
the
primary

truth

robert

says
ra
ra
well
jason
its
heretical
in
a
few
ways
the
first
point
is
that
ra
this
equates
lucifer
and
jesus
as
being
the
same
type
of
being
ra
however
lucifer
is
a
created
being
thou
wast
perfect
in
thy
ra
ways
from
the
day
that
thou
wast
created
till
iniquity
was
found
in
ra
thee
ezekiel
while
jesus
is
uncreated
and
the
creator
of
ra
all
things
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
ra
god
and
the
word
was
god
the
same
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
ra
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
without
him
was
not
any
thing
made
ra
that
was
made
john
and
he
is
before
all
things
and
by
ra
him
all
things
consist
colossians
ra
ra
your
inference
from
the
ezekiel
and
john
passages
that
lucifer
was
ra
created
and
that
jesus
was
not
depends
on
a
particular
interpetation
of
ra
the
word
create
one
with
which
many
christians
may
not
agree
ra
granted
the
mormon
belief
that
all
of
gods
children
including
christ
ra
and
lucifer
are
eternally
existent
intelligences
which
were
organized
ra
into
spirit
children
by
god
the
term
creation
can
apply
equally
well
ra
to
both
of
those
passages
just
briefly
on
something
that
you
mentioned
in
passing
you
refer
to
differing
interpretations
of
create
and
say
that
many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
ra
your
point
that
we
all
are
brothers
of
jesus
and
lucifer
is
also
ra
heretical
since
we
are
not
innately
brothers
and
sisters
of
christ
ra
we
are
adopted
for
ye
have
not
received
the
spirit
of
bondage
ra
again
to

but
ye
have
received
the
spirit
of
adoption
whereby
ra
we
cry
abba
father
romans
and
not
the
natural
children
ra
of

it
is
only
through
faith
that
we
even
enter
the

ra
god
for
ye
are
all
the
children

ra

it
is
only
through
the
manifestation
of

faith
in

that
we
are

ra
as
many

power

ra
has
it
occured
to
you
robert
that
being
born
of
someone
or
being
ra
of
that
person
or
persons
family
may
be
a
symbolic
term
in
the
new
ra
testament
mormons
believe
that
we
are

baptism
and
faith
in

although
some
have
expressed
ra
belief
that
this
does
evince
a
physical
change

the
mormon

is
that
all

there

nothing
symbolic
about

this
however
contradicts
what
the

removed
from

proclaim

denies
the

from
being
true
according
to

eternal

robert
with
all
due

you
chief
arbiter

correct
biblical
interpretation
i
dont
mean
to
be
snotty
about
this

but
the
fact
is
that
the
bible
is
so
differently
interpreted
by
different
ra
groups
of
biblical
scholars
what
do
you
think
of
the
jehovahs
ra
witnesses
for
example
that
to
make
reference
to
the
jesus
of
the
ra
bible
is
simply
ridiculous
whose
jesus
of
the
bible
do
you
mean
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
for
example
the
fact
that
the
jehovahs
witnesses
deny
the
deity
of
christ
does
not
alter
what
the
bible
teaches
looking
for
that
blessed
hope
and
the
glorious
appearing
of
the
great
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
titus
peter
a
servant
and
an

them
that
have
obtained
like
precious
faith
with
us
through
the
righteousness
of
god
and
our
saviour
jesus
christ
peter
on
the
deity
of

we
first
look
to
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
to
discount
or
not
even
address
what
the
bible
teaches
because
there
are
some

that
have
differing

is
selfdefeating
to
see
what
the

teaches
you
have
to
look
at
the
bible
ra
our

mortality
was
essential
to

rather
curious
when

that
jesus
needed
to
be

i
put
forward
some
quotes
from
the

bruce
mcconkie
the
curious
part
is
that
no
one
addressed
the
issue
of
jesus
needing
to
be
saved
rick
comes
the
closest
with
his
i
have
my
own
conclusions
to
addressing
the
point
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official

i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies

arjuna
as

is
advised
to
raise
himself
to
the
transcendental

of
vedanta
philosophy
where
in

there
is
brahmajijnasa

all

gave

the

when
the

the

the
bhagavadgita

the

the
upanisads
mark
the
beginning
of
transcendental
life
as
long
as
the
material
body
exists
there
are
actions
and
reactions
in
the
material
modes
one
has
to
learn
tolerance
in

of
dualities
such
as
happiness

distress

cold

by
tolerating
such

become

we

told
you
about
the
power

lord
jesus

honor

we

when

him

the
sacred
mountain

we
have
the
word

made

you
will
do

this

perhaps
further
research
on

is
warranted
before
making
more
statements
there
is
considerably
more

put

killing
most
of
the

i
would
hardly
consider
the

to

they
were
acting
in
direct

everyone

also
predicted

there

false
messiahs

will

his

his

im
not
that
annoyed
about
the
adults
they
knew
supposedly
what
they
were
doing
and
its
their
own
actions
what
i
mostly
are
angry
about
is
the
fact
that
the
people
inside
including
mothers
let
the
children
suffer
and
die
during
awful
conditions
i
agree
with
you
there
if
this
is
considered
religious
following
to
the
end
im
proud
that
i
dont
follow
such
fanatical
and
noncompassionate
religions
me
too
i
have
already
given
my
life
to
god
if
god
tells
me
to
lay
down
my

it
will
be
to
save
another

you
might
want
to
die
for
whatever
purpose

please
spare
the
innocent
young
ones
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
all
i
have
a
hard
time
just
now
understanding

christianity
knows
about
the

compassion
christians
do
you
think
the
actions
today
would
produce
a

do
you
judge
all
christians
by
the
acts
of
those
who
would
call
themselves
christian
and
yet
are
not
the
bds
contradicted
scripture
in
their
actions
they
were
not
christian
simple
as
that
perhaps
you
have
read
too
much
into
what
the
media
has
portrayed
ask
any
truebelieving
christian
and
you
will
find
that
they
will
deny
any
association
with
the
bds
even
the
day
adventists
have
denied
any
further
ties
with
this

you

if

i

they
persecuted
jesus
and
his
disciples
and
eventually
crucified
him
i
bear
them
no
ill
will
if
anything
i
feel
pity
for
them
jesus
had
to
die
to
pay
the
price
for
our
sins
and
so
the
jews
were
merely
fulfilling
prophesy
jesus
knew
he
had
to
die
even
before
he
began
his
ministry
that
demonstrates
the
great
depth

demonstrated

christians

the

do
you

this
up
the
most
blatent
persecution
of
the
jews
in

was
of

done
by
the

before

during

a

sure
many
muslims
in

consider
the
israelites
to
be
a
thorn
in
their
side
but
the
most
of
the
modern
persecution
of
jews
has
been
at
the
hands
of
christians
at

as
far
as
im
aware
rob

do
you
consider
neonazis

white

to

id
hardly
classify
them
as

do
they
follow
the
teachings
of
christ
love
one
another
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
love
your

is
jesus
christ
their
lord
and
saviour
by
the
persecution
of
jews
they
are
violating
all
the
precepts
of
what
christ
died
for
they
are
in
direct
violation
of
the
teachings
of
christ
even
jesus
who
was
crucified
by
the
jewish
leaders
of
that
time
loved
his
enemies
by
asking
the

for
forgiveness
of

i
am

for
those
who
think
david
koresh
didnt
have
a
solid
structure
or
sound
biblical
backing
for
his
hour
long
tape
broadcast
i
dont
think
anyone
really
cares
about
the
solid
structure
of
his
sermon
its
the
deaths
hes
responsible
for
that
concern
most
people
ive
enclosed
a
partial
list
of
the
sources
he
cites
or
quotes
he
exactly
used
as
a
christian
sermon
its
pretty
good
if
not
inspired
though
i
differ
in
part
on
some
of
his
conclusions
the
argument
he
presents
is
well
backed
which
is
why
its
taken
me
this
long
to
work
through
still
ongoing
if
you
thought
it
was
rambling
that
says
far
more
about
you
than
it
does
koresh
there
is
a
very
definite
relationship
between
the
youve
made
me
curious
what
does
this
say
about
me
first
seal
in
revelation
the
entirety
of
psalms
and
the
most
of
revelation
which
demonstrated
one
of
his
major
points
about
how
the
writings
in
the
prophets
including
david
and
in
the
psalms
and
in
revelation
are
all
telling
the
same
story
when
you
understand
how
theyre
related
ie
have
the
key
the
largely
explain
each
other
charles
manson
used
revelation
as
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
of
koresh
liked
the
beatles
the
sequence
following
is
keyed
to
the
koresh
tape
should
you
care
to
check
it
out
you
can
almost
see
the
note
cards
he
used
when
doing
the
analysis
long
list
of
biblical
references
which
impressed
me
tremendously
but
were
deleted
in
the
interests
of
common
sense
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
just
because
he
found
ways
for
the
bible
to
backup
his
rantings
does
not
make
him
any
less
of
a
kook
seems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
for
the
message
he
carried
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself
in
the
mean
time
we
sure
learned
a
lot
about
evil
and
corruption
are
you
surprised
things
have
gotten
that
rotten
the
evil
was
inside
the
compound
all
that
thou
shalt
not

peters

compares

with

look
you
just
practically
equated
odin
and
zeus
theyre
as
much
different

your

is

dont
you
see
im
not
going

accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my

with
my

especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying

get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
withough
checking
his

he
thinks
hell
is
the
equivalent
of
nonexistence
when
did
i
say
that
i
say
that
i
would
rather
cease
existing
instead
of
being
subject
to
the

of
a
deity
but
that
if
the
deity
decided
to
toss
me
into
the
fiery
pits
because
of
who
i
am
then
so
be
it
do
you
enjoy
darkness
most
people
will
honestly
admit
yes
most
people
are
fond
of
their
sexual
sins
their
hording
of
money
their
selfishness
and
not
to
mention
their
biblical
ignorance
nope
most
people
are
christian
most
people
are
fond
of
feeling
that
they
are
imperfect
of
believing
that
the
world
is
an
undesirable
place
of
reciting
magical
mystical
prayers
to
make
the
world
nice
and
holy
again
of
doing
just
as
their
priests
tell
them
like
good
little
sheep
you
enjoy
darkness
and
youre
proud
of
it
you
may
know
the
bible
well
but
have
you
read
any
of
the
koran
or
zen
writings
or
hare
krishna
literature
if
you
havent
then
how
can
you
say
you
have
an
open
mind
sin
is
fun
lets
admit
it
but
a
life
of
sin
leads
to
trouble
and
death
in
this
life
and
hell
in
the
next
nope
you
make
decisions
enjoy
your
successes
and
accept
your
failures
then
you
die
if
you
are
content
with
the
life
youve
led
as
you
reflect
back
on
it
in
your
final
moments
then
youve
led
a
good
life
come
out
from
under
the
rock
please
do
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
one
and
only
son
that
whoever
believes
in
him
shall
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
forget
the
bible
for
a
minute
forget
quoting
verses
forget
about
who
said
what
about
this
or
that
show

picture
just

dr

comments

statement
but
the
problem
is
we
consider
ourself

even
though
you
dont
luckily
faith
is
determined
by
what
one
believes
and
is
a

you

mr

then
comments

you
are
not

the

would

that
the

that

dont

who
one
considers

cobeliever
is
also
a

it

who
should

the

by

is
funny
he
writes
the
converse
would
be
that
the

is
that
muslims
dont

which
is
a
wrong
statement
in
the
light
of
dr

statement
the
above
statement
should
be
corrected
is
that
some
nonahmadi
muslims
dont
consider
ahmadimuslims
as
muslims
so
the
problem
does
not
get
solved
who
is
a
muslims
and
who
is
not
humans
cannot
decide
humans
may
not
declare

faiths
its
that
simple
i
dont
understand
why
the
mere
use
of
the

islam
is
becomming
such
a

i

no
no
you

i

both
you

have

ive
criticized
bad

both
when

that

when

ive
criticized
both
you

for

jesus
christ
never
commanded
toleration
as
a
motive
for
his
disciples
and
toleration
is
the
antithesis
of
the
christian
message
page
the
central
dynamic
of
the
freemason
drive
for
world
unity
through
fraternity
liberty
and
equality
is
toleration
this
is
seen
in
the
writings
of
the
great
writers
of
freemasonry
page
he
jesus
christ
established
the
most
sectarian
of
all
possible
faiths
page
for
narrowness
and
sectarianism
there
is
no
equal
to
the

jesus

page
what
seems
so
right
in
the
interest
of
toleration
and
its
cousinsliberty
equality

actually

southern

many
churches
which
were

dedicated
by
the

each
of
these

should
hold

of

and
of
praying
the

the

james

you
seem
to
be
saying
that
god
being
unknowable
his
morality
is
unknowable
yep
thats
pretty
much
it
as
i
understand
it
the
sadducees
believed
that
the
torah
was
all
that
was
required
whereas
the
pharisees
the
ancestors
of
modern
judaism
believed
that
the
torah
was
available
for
interpretation
to
lead
to
an
understanding
of
the
required
morality
in
all
its
nuances
talmud
the
essence
of
all
of
this
is
that
biblical
morality
is
an
interface
between
man
and
yhwh
for
a
jew
or
christian
and
does
not
necessarily
indicate
anything
about
yhwh
outside
of
that
relationship
although
one
can
speculate
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
we
only
really
have
the
bible
to
interpret
and
that
interpretation
is
by
humanity
i
guess
this
is
where
faith
or
relevation
comes
in
with
all
its
inherent
subjectiveness
god
being
unknowable
i
cant
comment
on
his
motives
but
it
would
be
distressing
if
he
allowed
us
to
misunderstand
him
through
no
fault
of
our
own
for
sanitys
sake
we
must
assume
if
we
believe
in
him
at
all
that
his
message
comes
through
somehow
the
question
is
whether
it
comes
through
immediately
to
every
individual
or
is
contained
in
a
complex
canon
that
must
be
interpreted
by
experts
in
consultation
with
one
another
or
is
transmitted
directly
through
appointed
representatives
who
are
free
to
interpret
extend
and
modify
the
canon
if
gods
message
is
indeed
mediated
the
further
problem
arises
as
to
whether
the
individual
under
stands
the
mediated
message
fully
and
clearly
since
the
responsibility
for
understanding
lies
ultimately
with
the
individual
we
must
assume
that
god
in
his
benevolence
guides
each
individual
to
the
appropriate
source
for
that
individual
whereof
the
person
may
or
may
not
drink
metaphysically
if
there
are
multiple
moral
codes
then
there
is
no
absolute
moral
code
and
i
think
this
is
theologically
questionable
no
there
may
be
an
absolute
moral
code
there
are
undoubtably
multiple
moral
codes
the
multiple
moral
codes
may
be
founded
in
the
absolute
moral
code
as
an
example
a
parent
may
tell
a
child
never
to
swear
and
the
child
may
assume
that
the
parent
never
swears
simply
because
the
parent
has
told
the
child
that
it
is
wrong
now
the
parent
may
swear
like
a
trooper
in
the
pub
or
bar
where
there
are
no
children
the
wrongness
here
is
if
the
child
disobeys
the
parent
the
parent
may
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
swear
in
front
of
children
but
may
be
quite
happy
to
swear
in
front
of
animals
the
analogy
does
not
quite
hold
water
because
the
child
knows
that
he
is
of
the
same
type
as
the
parent
and
may
be
a
parent
later
in
life
but
you
get
the
gist
of
it
incidentally
the
young
child
considers
the
directive
as
absolute
until
he
gets
older
see
piaget
and
learns
a
morality
of
his
own
your
example
is
complicated
in
our
age
by
the
thin
line
between
morality
and
politeness
you
might
have
said
burp
for
burping
and
swearing
carry
about
the
same
stigma
today
if
you
are
talking
about
taking
the
lords
name
in
vain
as
a
serious
transgression
then
this
example
is
more
a
case
of
hypocrisy
than
of
varying
moral
codes
if
there
is
an
absolute
moral
code
propositions
or
laws
in
that
code
apply
absolutely
and
universally
by
definition
conceivably
some
moral
codes
could
be
subsets
of
the
universal
code
as
you
say
at
the
outset
so
for
example
gods
code
could
include
thou
shalt
not
create
beings
without
a
hospitable
planet
to
live
on
but
this
law
would
be
inapplicable
to
us
nevertheless
we
would
be
entitled
to
suppose
that
all
laws
applicable
to
us
are
also
applicable
to
god
but
when
you
begin
to
ask
what
laws
might
appear
in
gods
moral
code
you
have
a
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
question
does
god
make
laws
for
himself
to
follow
perhaps
god
is
not
the
sort
of
being
to
which
the
category
morality
can
be
sensibly
applied

imo
a
christian
has
no
need
of
weapons
i
know
it
is
very
contrary
to
the
american
nra
ethos
of
the
right
to
bear
arms
but
christians
should
rely
on
the
strength
of
god
to
protect
them
note
that
i
say
should
we
are
inherently
insecure
but
i
feel
that
that
is
not
proper
justification
to
be
armed
to
the
teeth
a
christian
should
not
have
to
rely
on
physical
weapons
to
defend
himself
a
christian
should
rely
on
his
faith
and
intelligence
for
instance
i
have
the
faith
that
god
will
protect
me
but
god
also
gave
me
the
intelligence
to
know
not
to
go
walking
down
that
dark
alley
at
night
to
jump
off
a
cliff
and
say
that
god
will
save
me
would
be
putting
god
to
the
test
and
who
are
we
to
test
god

by

your

the

are
you
truly

i
have
admitted

am

i
sometimes
say
things
i

i
shouldnt

then
say
it
anyway
there
are

i
simply
forget

i
in

am
not
my

i
need
help
jesus
promised
me
this
help
and
i
took
him
up
on
his
offer
i
have
willfully
let
jesus
be
my
master
because
jesus
knows
what
is
better
for

than
i
myself
do

why
not
does
not

will
be

at
first

you
build

its
well
worth
it

i

ignorance
is

for
you

brian
you

not

about

dont
you
see
im
not
going

accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my
own
eyes
or
experience
with
my
own
senses
especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
can
you
witness
motherly
love
with
your
senses
how
does
caring
and
concern
for
you
register
with
your
senses
if
nothing
registers
to
you
other
than
what
you
can
see
taste
smell
hear

touch
then
you
better
become
a
vulcan
and
fast
you
better
get
rid
of
your
emotions
and
i
do
have
a
good
reason
to
believe
what
i
do
when
did
i
say
that
i
say
that
i
would
rather
cease
existing
instead
of
being
subject
to
the
whims
of
a
deity
but
that
if
the
deity
decided
to
toss
me
into
the
fiery
pits
because
of
who
i
am
then
so
be

the
topic
was
about
my

and
your
lack
of
knowledge
about
what
my
god
says
my
god
says
that
you
will
not

you
have
life
forever
you
can
choose
to
either
live
it
in
hell
in
eternal
torment
where
there
is
no
communication
whatsoever
or
can
choose

live

mine
doesnt

kendigianism
also
dictate
that
one
must
obey
what
the

mine
doesnt
is
this
a
bunch
of
lies
you
tell

so
that
you
can
justify
being
ignorant
of
the

brian
following

has
nothing
to
do
with

you
would
find
any
of
your
doctrines
in

i
dont
follow

i
follow

also
to
try
to
again
show
you
your

the

in

have
you
not

have
you
not

what

is

and
why
there
should
not
be

today
yes
guess
what
the
catholics
messed
up
i
do
not
follow
catholicism
or
any
ism
i
follow
christ
nope
you
make
decisions
enjoy
your
successes
and
accept
your
failures
then
you
die
if
you
are
content
with
the
life
youve
led
as
you
reflect
back
on
it
in
your
final
moments
then
youve
led
a
good
life
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing

it

faith

robert
weiss
says
just
briefly
on
something
that
you
mentioned
in
passing
you
refer
to
differing
interpretations
of
create
and
say
that
many
christians
may
not
agree
so
what
that
is
really
irrelevant
we
do
not
base
our
faith
on
how
many
people
think
one
way
or
another
do
we
the
bottom
line
is
truth
regardless
of
popularity
of
opinions
im
sorry
i
thought
we
were
discussing
heresy
i
assumed
that
heresy
meant
a
departure
from
orthodoxy
in
which
case
generally
accepted
belief
is
indeed
an
important
issue
in
this
case
the
definition
of
the
word
create
is
of
great
importance
since
creation
is
the
issue
being
discussed
also
i
find
it
rather
strange
that
in
trying
to
persuade
that
created
and
eternally
existent
are
equivalent
you
say
granted
the
mormon
belief
you
cant
grant
your
conclusion
and
then
expect
the
point
to
have
been
addressed
in
order
to
reply
to
the
issue
you
have
to
address
and
answer
the
point
that
was
raised
and
not
just
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
you
grant
i
should
have
said
given
the
mormon
belief
if
you
disagree
with
the
mormon
belief
that
creation
is
more
a
function
of
organization
of
eternally
existent
substance
than
one
of
ex
nihilo
creation
then
that
is
the
important
point
the
bible
states
that
lucifer
was
created
the
bible
states
that
jesus
is
the
creator
of
all
the
contradiction
that
we
have
is
that
the
lds
belief
is
that
jesus
and
lucifer
were
the
same
correction
you
interpret
the
bible
to
mean
something
very
specific
by
such
terms
the
mormon
belief
is
that
all
are
children
of
god
literally
there
is
nothing
symbolic
about
it
this
however
contradicts
what
the
bible
says
the
bible
teaches
that
not
everyone
is
a
child
of
god
it
always
cracks
me
up
when
antimormons
presume
to
tell
mormons
what
they
believe
mormons
do
in
fact
believe
that
all
people
including
christ
and
lucifer
are
children
of
god
in
the
sense
that
we
were
all
created
or
organized
or
whatever
by
him
we
also
believe
that
being
offspring
of
god
has
a
symbolic
sense
when
applied
to
being
spiritually
born
again
of
him
thus
the
same
word
can
be
used
to
convey
different
meanings
this
is
how
language
works
robert
and
its
why
making
someone
an
offender
for
a
word
is
dangerous
this
is
really
a
red
herring
it
doesnt
address
any
issue
raised
but
rather
it
seeks
to
obfuscate
the
fact
that
some
groups
try
to
read
something
into
the
bible
doesnt
change
what
the
bible
teaches
for
we
first
look
to
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
to
discount
or
not
even
address
what
the
bible
teaches
because
there
are
some
groups
that
have
differing
views
is
selfdefeating
to
see
what
the
bible
teaches
you
have
to
look
at
the
bible
on
the
contrary
robert
it
is
not
a
red
herring
at
all
to
show
that
those
who
rely
wholly
on
the
bible
cannot
seem
to
agree
on
what
it
says
you
say
that
one
must
simply
look
at
the
bible
to
see
what
it
teaches
but
centuries
of
people
doing
just
that
have
that
no
one
is
really
sure
what
it
says
are
we
to
believe
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
understands
the
scriptures
i
find
this
rather
curious
when
i
mentioned
that
the
mormon
belief
is
that
jesus
needed
to
be
saved
i
put
forward
some
quotes
from
the
late
apostle
bruce
mcconkie
the
curious
part
is
that
no
one
addressed
the
issue
of
jesus
needing
to
be
saved
rick
comes
the
closest
with
his
i
have
my
own
conclusions
to
addressing
the
point
let
me
clarify
this
one
more
time
you
did
not
refer
to
the
mormon
belief
that
jesus
needed
to
be
saved
but
rather
to
mcconkies
belief
in
same
we
keep
trying
to
point
out
to
you
that
bruce
mcconkie
is
not
the
source
of
mormon
doctrine
and
you
keep
ignoring
it
see
below
most
of
the
other
replies
have
instead
hopscotched
to
the
issue
of
bruce
mcconkie
and
whether
his
views
were
official
doctrine
i
dont
think
that
it
matters
if
mcconkies
views
were
canon
that
is
not
the
issue
were
mcconkies
writings
indicative
of
mormon
belief
on
this
subject
is
the
real
issue
the
indication
from
rick
is
that
they
may
certainly
be
on
the
contrary
robert
if
you
are
quoting
mcconkies
words
as
mormon
canon
then
the
question
of
whether
they
are
canon
or
not
is
of
great
importance
the
fact
is
that
they
are
not
whether
or
not
they
indicate
general
mormon
belief
would
only
be
ascertainable
by
interviewing
a
large
number
of
mormons

perhaps
you
dont

and
maybe
you
never
will
many
didnt
get
it
in
the
middle
ages
and
the
proclaimed
gods
will
be
done
as
they
massacred
thousands
in
witch
hunts
and
inquisitions
there
were
many
injustices
in
the
middle
ages
and
this
is
truely
sad
i
would
hate
to
see
a
day
when
churches
put
people
to
death
or
torchured
them
for
practicing
homosexuality
or
any
other
crime
the
church
is
not
called
to
take
over
the
governments
of
the
world
it
may
be
that
homosexuals
treated
cruelly
today
but
that
does
not
mean
that
we
should
teach
christians
to
practice
homosexual
immorality
do
you
think
that
we
should
also
teach
christians
to
practice
divination
and
channelling
because
the
witches
in
the
middle
ages
were
persecuted
the
major
flaw
in
all
this
posturing
is
that
in
the
end
the
final
effect
of
posts
like
that
of
yours
and
mr
hudson
is
that
you
have
a
conditional
love
for
gays
condition
change
and
well
love
you
this
is
sure
strange
coming
from
a
group
who
claim
that
god
has
an
unconditional
love
one
that
calls
people
just
as
they
are
and
you
accuse
me
of
judging
when
did
you
look
into
my
heart
and
see
if
i
have
love
i
have
been
writing
that
we
should
not
teach
christians
to
practice
homosexual
immorality
and
you
pretend
to
have
divine
knowledge
to
look
into
my
heart
i
cant
say
that
i
love
homosexuals
as
i
should
i
cant
say
that
i
love
my
neighbor
as
i
should
either
i
dont
know
very
many
homosexuals
as
it
is
but
jesus
loves
homosexuals
just
as
he
loves
everyone
else
if
his
love
were
conditional
i
not
know
him
at
all
yes
we
should
show
love
to
homosexuals
but
it
is
not
love
to
encourage
brothers
in
the
church
to
stumble
and
continue
in
their
sin
that
is
a
very
damaging
and
dangerous
thing
the
results
of
the
passing
amendment
in
colorado
has
created
an
organization
whos
posters
are
appearing
all
over
colorado
called
straight
i
forget
the
whole
definition
off
hand
but
the
last
part
was
against
immoral
gross
homosexual
trash
and
their
motto
is
working
for
a
fagfree
america
with
an
implicit
advocation
for
violence
this
is
sick
and
it
seems
to
be
what
you
and
mr
hudson
and
others
are
embracing
that
is
slander
i
could
just
as
easily
say
that
nambla
has
been
able
to
implement
legislation
to
make
child
molesting
easier
because
of
the
tearing
down
of
societies
morality
due
to
people
accepting
homosexuality
as
normal
and
that
this
is
what
you
are
embracing
i
do
believe
that
homosexual
sex
is
immoral
that
does
not
mean
i
endorse
using
violence
against
them
there
is
a
problem
of
hatred
in
the
church
but
there
is
also
the
problem
of
what
has
been
called
unsanctified
mercy
many
in
the
conservative
churches
have
seen
the
moral
breakdown
in
this
country
and
the
storm
on
the
horizon
and
have
gotten
militant
in
the
flesh
this
is
truely
sad
yet
others
in
other
churches
have
embraced
immorality
in
society
and
have
pointed
to
the
carnality
in
the
conservative
churches
to
justify
their
actions
why
dont
we
just
stick
to
the
positive
and
find
ways
to
bring
people
to
jesus
istead
of
taking
bullwhips
and
driving
them
away
certainly
we
should
not
use
a
bullwhip
to
drive
people
from
jesus
but
we
shouldnt
water
down
the
gospel
to
draw
people
in
jesus
didnt
go
out
of
his
way
to
show
only
what
might
be
considered
positive
aspects
to
draw
people
in
he
told
one
man
to
sell
all
he
had
he
told
another
not
to
say
good
bye
to
his
family
his
words
were
hard
at
times
we
should
present
people
with
the
cost
of
the
tower
before
we
allow

to
begin

for

the

this
thrilling
discussion
between
jim
and
i
jim
wrote
the
following
to
me
in
email
after
i
pointed
out
that
he
jim
had
taken
a
quote
out
of
context
in
trm
robert
weiss
writes
a
promise
from
psalm
gee
since
you
wouldnt
be
at
all
hypocritical
you
must
be
really
busy
arguing
against
these
outofcontext
extracted
translations
he
directed
a
similar
accusation
of
hypocrisy
again
based
on
a
lack
of
response
to
an
article
by
robert
weiss
toward
stephen
i
pointed
out
that
i
did
in
fact
agree
that
both
robert
weiss
and
jim
meritt
took
quotes
out
of
context
hence
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
jim
thinks
i
am
a
hypocrite
needless
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
reply
to
every
article
on
trm
that
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
i
asked
jim
the
following
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
jim
replied
by
saying
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articles
from
jim
one
of
which
has
the
subject
silence
is
concurrence
james
meritt
writes
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
when
someone
is
aware
of
something
and
has
the
capability
of
taking
action
and
does
not
that
individual
may
be
held
responsible
for
that
action
which
is
of
course
a
complete
red
herring
taking
quotes
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
every
article
on
trm
and
im
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
reply
to
them
all
does
silence
is
concurrence
imply
that
jim
thinks
that
because
i
didnt
respond
to
weiss
articles
i
must
condone
weiss
taking
quotes
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
this
question
read
what
he
has
written
and
decide
for
yourself
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
conversation
with
jim
jims
next
gambit
was
to
claim
that
he
was
using
inductive
logic
when
he
concluded
that
i
was
being
a
hypocrite
i
challenged
him
to
provide
the
details
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclusion
today
we
find
another
obscure
article
posting
it
twice
didnt
help
make
it
more
clear
jim
titled

uncountably
large
number
of
times
a
black
goose
waddles
past
the
door
an
individual
hits
it
with
an
axe
given
that
the
population
of
geese
is
uncountably
large
and
the
size
of
the
confidence
interval
for
the
decision
is
undetermined
under
what
conditions
could
a
decision
upon
the
behavior
of
the
individual
towards
white
geese
be
made
if
only
black
geese
are
observed
to
be
axed
is
it
not
a
valid
question
to
be
concerned
with
the
different
behavior
between
black
and
white
geese
more
red
herrings
could
jim
mean
that
he
has
read
an
uncountably
large
number
of
my
articles
could
jim
mean
that
because
i
axed
his
articles
but
not
weiss
articles
he
wants
to
conclude
inductively
well
i
cant
see
where
he
is
going
with
this
but
i
can
help
him
with
his
induction
ive
written
roughly
articles
since
january
the
vast
majority
of
them
are
discussions
with
frank
decenso
and
other
inerrantists
where
i
take
the
position
that
they
are
making
bad
arguments
some
are
discussions
with
jim
meritt
where
i
take
the
position
that
he
is
making
bad
arguments
a
straw

earlier
and

recently

yesterday
the

and
the
second
more
serious
one
appeared
along
the
thread
a
chaney
post
and
a
challenge
reissued
and
revised
both
only
in
talkabortion
but
i
am
posting
its
contents
into
talkreligionmisc
as
soon
as
i
exit
here
this
should
be
enough
for
us
to
thrash
out
for
the
next
week
or
so
the
second
post
really
grapples
with
the
main
bones
of
contention
between
us
the
first
is
more
lighthearted
and
tells
about
such
things
as
kaflowitzdebatingpoints
tm
which
he
continues
to
rack
up
on
both
talkabortion
and
talkreligionmisc
while
setting
followups
to
talkabortion
alone
his
lame
excuse
for
the
latter
policy
is
that
he
gets
a
prompt
as
to
where
to
set
followups
and
does
not
follow
talkreligionmisc
much
this
suggests
that
he
is

hypocritical

not
also
setting

on

it

with

and
gomorrah
as
with

in
the
post
to
which
dean
is
referring
above
i
said
the
above
is
a
good
description
of
kaflowitz
who
keeps
harping
on
shaking
the
dust
off
the
feet
but
ignoring
what
christ
said
next
the
highlighted
words
refer
to
matt
and
respectively
and
dean
countered
actually
this
comment
of
yours
is
a
perfect
example
of
what
an
intellectually
dishonest
little
sparrowfart
you
are
since
i
specifically
acknowledged
the
great
commission
and
the
entreaty
to
spread
the
word
in
fact
it
is
the
combination
of
the
two
statements
i
was
addressing
and
not
just
the
one
and
for
you
to
characterize
that
as
ignoring
the
instruction
to
spread
the
word
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
dishonest
little
fellow
you
are
of
course
matt
quoted
above
makes
no
mention
of
instruction
to
spread
the
word
all
these
quotes
btw
are
from
messageid
in
which
at
the
end
he
claims
i
did
not
answer
a
question
which
i
answered
and
which
he
deleted
to
get
the
chronology
right
he
deleted
the
answer
and
then
said
i
didnt
answer
and
i
claim
it
correctly
because
my
question
went
do
you
too
measure
the
goodness
of
a
post
by
its
entertainment
value
and
care
not
a
whit
for
such
mundane
things
as
truth
and
falsehood
and
the
closest
dean
came
to
an
answer
was
peter
peter
peter
youre
just
so
stupid
pretentious
dull
and
generally
unworthy
of
the
value
you
place
on
yourself
that
the
sport
is
all
there
is
of
course
this
does
not
answer
my
question
which
has
to
do
with
posts
in
general
and
not
my
posts
in
particular
surely
even
dean
knows
this
yet
he
brazenly
asserts
otherwise
reinforcing
his
claim
with
an
insult
so
i
now
restore
the
answer
to
your
question
that
you
deleted
if
youre
still
unable
to
figure
it
out
ask
a
nice
kid
at
the
local
junior
high
to
help
you
it
really
doesnt
take
much
sophistication
to
understand
on
top
of
which
i
doubt
that
the
answer
is
at
all
representative
of
deans
true
frame
of
mind
the
insults
you
have
seen
quoted
thus
far
are
but
a
small
sample
of
the
stream
that
oozes
out
of
deans
mind
throughout
the
post
from
which
these
quotes
were
taken
one
wonders
whether
deans
mind
is
so
warped
as
to
find
sport
in
all
this
he
even
dredges
up
a
falsified
account
of
events
that
transpired
earlier
on
another
thread
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
claiming
that
it
was
in
the
tradition
of
lent
to
make
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
other
individuals
false
i
said
it
was
the
tradition
to
recall
and
atone
for
ones
sins
that
i
made
public
announcements
of
the
sins
of
others
sins
btw
that
were
a
matter
of
public
record
documented
in
the
posts
of
others
is
a
different
matter
many
of
the
individuals
involved
are
so
nearly
amoral
that
they
do
not
see
as
sins
what
morally
upright
people
see
as
sins
so
i
pointed
some
of
them
out
and
i
expressly
set
up
a
whole
thread
your
turn
to
let
people
point
out
my
sins
to
me
dean
again
you
made
an
ass
of
yourself
by
saying
that
my
statement
of
the
tradition
of
tzedukkah
was
somehow
an
attempt
to
paint
jews
as
plaster
saints
thereby
revealing
your
inability
to
understand
the
discussion
as
well
as
showing
your
dislike
for
people
saying
positive
things
about
jews
and
now
you
show
your
intellectual
dishonesty
by
repeatedly
ignoring
the
simple
argument
being
made
and
then
claiming
i
am
ignoring
the
very
argument
i
acknowledge
actually
what
happened
was
that
dean
made
it
seem
like
any
jew
who
gave
alms
or
did
other
acts
of
charity
in
public
was
a
hypocrite
according
to
jewish
customs
in
doing
so
he
was
caricaturing
jewish
customs
as
being
almost
impossibly
demanding
as
well
as
implicitly
slandering
all
jews
who
make
public
their
acts
of
charity
i
went
very
easily
on
dean
for
this
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
a
post
following
my
initial
crack
about
plaster
saints
suggesting
that
he
had
been
merely
careless
in
his
wording
in
an
astonishing
act
of
ingratitude
dean
now
serves
up
an
incredibly
distorted
picture
of
what
took
place
between
us
and
using
it
as
the
basis
of
one
insult
after
another

why

we

stick
to
the
positive
and
find
ways

to

istead
of
taking

and
driving
them
away
certainly
we
should
not
use
a

to
drive
people
from

but
we
shouldnt
water
down
the
gospel
to
draw
people
in
very
well
put

in
the
case
of
someone
who
calls
himself
a

brother
yet
continues
in
his
sin
and
claims
that
his
sin
is
not
a
sin
at
all
but
perfectly
acceptable
what
should
be
done
should
christians
just
ignore
a
sinful
lifestyle
in
order
to
not
offend
the
person
by
reaffirming
that
the
lifestyle
is
sinful
according
to
the
bible
are
they
using
a
bullwhip
to
drive
people
from
jesus
frankly
i
find
the
occurance
of
a
homosexual
christian
attempting
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
straight
christian
in
order
to
have
other
christians
accept
his
chastisement
better
a
lot
more
serious
than
people
reaffirming
that
the
bible
teaches
homosexuality
is
a
sin
walter
subject
the
divine
masters
the
divine
masters
most
christians
would
agree
and
correctly
so
that
jesus
christ
was
a
divine
master
and
a
projection
of
god
into
the
physical
world
god
incarnate
but
there
are
some
very
important
related
facts
that
christians
are
completely
ignorant
of
as
are
followers
of
most
other
world
religions
first
jesus
christ
was
not
unique
john
notwith
standing
there
is
always
at
least
one
such
divine
master
god
incarnate
physically
alive
in
this
world
at
all
times
a
continuous
succession
throughout
history
both
before
and
after
the
life
of
jesus
the
followers
of
some
of
these
masters
founded
the
worlds
major
religions
usually
perverting
the
teachings
of
their
master
in
the
process
christians
for
example
added
threats
of
eternal
damnation
in
hell
and
deleted
the
teaching
of
reincarnation
secondly
and
more
importantly
after
a
particular
master
physically
dies
and
leaves
this
world
there
is
nothing
that
he
can
do
for
anybody
except
for
the
relatively
few
people
that
he
initiated
while
he
was
still
physically
alive
that
is
simply
the
way
god
set
things
up
in
the
universes
therefore
all
those
christians
who
worship
jesus
and
pray
to
jesus
and
expect
jesus
to
return
and
save
them
from
their
sins
are
only
kidding
themselves
and
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
duped
by
a
religion
that
was
mostly
manufactured
by
the
romans
and
emotional
feelings
are
a
totally
deceiving
indicator
for
religious
validity
these
things
are
similarly
true
for
followers
of
most
other
major
world
religions
including
islam
thirdly
the
primary
function
of
each
master
is
to
tune
his
initiates
into
the
audible
life
stream
or
sound
current
referred
to
as
the
word
in
john
and
as
the
river
of
life
in
revelation
and
to
personally
guide
each
of
them
thru
the
upper
levels
of
heaven
while
they
are
still
connected
to
their
living
physical
bodies
by
a
silver
cord
true
salvation
which
completes
a
souls
cycles
of
reincarnation
in
the
physical
and
psychic
planes
is
achieved
only
by
reaching
at
least
the
soul
plane
which
is
five
levels
or
universes
above
the
physical
universe
and
this
cannot
be
done
without
the
help
of
a
physicallyliving
divine
master
one
such
divine
master
alive
today
is
an
american
sri
harold
klemp
the
living
eck
master
or
mahanta
for
the
eckankar
organization
now
headquartered
in
minneapolis
po

another
divine
master
is
maharaj
gurinder
singh
ji
now
living
in
punjab
india
and
is
associated
with
the
sant
mat
organization
one
of
the

of

can
be

obtained
thru

loan
the
book
eckankarthe
key
to
secret
worlds
by
sri
paul
twitchell
is
another
classic
many
christians
are
likely
to
confuse
the
masters
with
the
antichrist
which
is
or
was
to
be
a
temporary
world
dictator
during
the
socalled
last
days
but
the
masters
dont
ever
rule
even
when
asked
or
expected
to
do
so
as
jesus
was
people
who
continue
following
christianity
islam
or
other
orthodox
religions
with
a
physicallydead
master
will
continue
on
their
cycles
of
reincarnation
between
the
psychic
planes
and
this
miserable
physical
world
until
they
finally
accept
initiation
from

master
reincarnation
the
book
here
and
hereafter
by
ruth
montgomery
describes
several
kinds
of
evidence
supporting
reincarnation
as
a
fact
of
life
including
hypnotic
regressions
to
past
lives
about
accurate
the
subconscious
mind
sometimes
makes
things
up
especially
with
a
bad

by

how
can
a
person
possibly
sin
before
he

version
later
versions
are
perversions
strong

strong

etc
typically
originate
from
a
persons
past
lives
for
example
a
strong
fear
of
swimming
in
or
traveling
over
water
usually
results
from
having
drowned
at
the
end
of
a
previous
life
and
sometimes
a
person
will
take
an
immediate
dislike
to
another
person
being
met
for
the
first
time
in
this
life
because
of
a
bad
encounter
with
him
during
a
previous
incarnation
the
teaching
of
reincarnation
also
includes
the
law
of
karma
galatians
revelation
etc
people
would
behave
much
better
toward
each
other
if
they
knew
that
their
actions
in
the
present
will
surely
be
reaped
by
them
in
the
future
or
in
a
future
incarnation
comings
if
a
divine
master
physically
dies
translates
before
a
particular
initiate
of
his
does
then
when
that
initiate
physically
dies
translates
the
master
will
meet
him
on
the
astral
level
and
take
him
directly
to
the
soul
plane
this
is
the
one
and
only
correct
meaning
of
a
coming
it
is
an
individual
experience
not
something
that
happens
for
everyone
all
at
once
people
who
are
still
waiting
for
jesus
coming
are
waiting
in
vain
planes
of
existence
the
physical
universe
is
the
lowest
of
at
least
a
dozen
major
levels
of
existence
above
the
physical
plane
is
the
astral
plane
the
causal
plane
the
mental
plane
the
etheric
plane
often
counted
as
the
upper
part
of
the
mental
plane
the
soul
plane
and
several
higher
spiritual
planes
the
soul
plane
is
the
first
true
heaven
counting
upward
from
the
physical
the
planes
between
but
not
including
the
physical
and
soul
planes
are
called
the
psychic
planes
it
is
likely
that
esp
telepathy
astrological
influences
radionic
effects
biological
transmutations
see
the
book
with
that
title
and
other
phenomena
without
an
apparent
physical
origin
result
from
interactions
between
the
psychic
planes
and
the
physical
plane
the
major
planes
are
also
subdivided
for
example
a
subplane
of
the
astral
plane
is
called
hades
and
the
christian
hell
occupies
a
small
part
of
it
created
there
less
than
years
ago
by
the
early
catholic
church
by
some
kind
of
black
magic
or
by
simply
teaching
its
existence
in
a
threatening
manner
the
christian
heaven
is
located
elsewhere
on
the
astral
plane
good
christians
will
go
there
for
a
short
while
and
then
reincarnate
back
to
earth
sound
current
vs
blind
faith
the
christian
religion
demands
of
its
followers
an
extraordinary
amount
of
blind
faith
backed
up
by
little
more
than
good
feeling
which
is
totally
deceiving
if
a
person
is
not
hearing
some
form
of
the
sound
current
the
word
the
bani
the
audible
life
stream
then
his
cycles
of
reincarnation
in
this
miserable
world
will
continue
the
sound
current
manifests
differently
for
different
initiates
and
can
sound
like
a
rushing
wind
ocean

the

subject
re
freemasonry
and
the
southern
baptist
convention
there
were
some
recent
developments
in
the
dispute
about
masonry
among
southern
baptists
i
posted
a
summary
over
in
bitlistservchristia
and
i
suppose
that
it
might
be
useful
here
note
that
i
do
not
necessarily
agree
or
disagree
with
any
of
what
follows
i
present
it
as
information
for
a
short
summary
a
southern
baptist
named
larry
holly
wrote
a
book
claiming
that
freemasonry
is
a
religion
incompatible
with
christianity
mr
hollys
father
rejects
christianity
and
mr
holly
blames
that
on
the
masons
the
sbcs
home
missions
board
includes
an
interfaith
witness
department
which
studies
other
religions
and
how
to
teach
them
about
christ
a
few
years
ago
they
were
ordered
to
produce
a
report
on
masonry
they
concluded
that
it
was
not
a
religion
and
therefore
was
outside
their
speciality
however
mr
holly
led
a
movement
of
people
who
oppose
masonry
and
last
year
the
convention
again
ordered
the
hmb
to
study
masonry
i
got
the
feeling
that
they
were
saying
you
got
the
wrong
answer
last
time
try
to
do
better
and
get
the
answer
we
want
anyway
theres
been
a
bit
of
infighting
and
some
inappropriate
actions
but
the
dust
has
settled
and
the
report
is
in
nobody
is
entirely
happy
with
it
but
everybody
seems
willing
to
live
with
it
both
sides
are
saying
things
such
as
this
was
the
best
we
were
going
to
get
in
the
current
environment
the
report
commends
the
masons
for
the
charity
work
they
do
such
as
the
hospitals
and
burn
centers
they
operate
as
well
as
efforts
to
help
the
elderly
and
prevent
drug
abuse
the
report
acknowledges
that
many
well
known
christians
are
and
have
been
masons
and
notes
that
many
teachings
of
masonry
are
supportive
of
christian
faith
and
practice
examples
of
the
latter
include
belief
in
god
emphases
on
honesty
and
integrity
and
that
some
masonic
lodges
incorporate
explicit
christian
beliefs
on
the
other
hand
they
note
that
some
aspects
of
masonry
are
incompatible
with
southern
baptist
principles
these
included
the
use
of
titles
which
some
people
consider
sacrilegious

with

chagrin
that

arent
really

says

left

this
was
in
part
because
there
is
variation
among
different
masonic
lodges
and
while
one
may
include
elements
strongly
against
christianity
another
may
not
many
southern
baptists
have
strong
convictions
about
the

of

the

probably
influenced

is
a

a

and
which
most
likely
dates
from

era
probably
the
second
century
ce
widengren
the
zoroastrian
doctrine
of
the

of

saoshyant
was
the
basis
for
the
story
of
the
coming
of
the
magi
to
bethlehem
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
the
old
persian
word
magu
rendered
in
greek
by
magos
is
of
uncertain
etymology
it
may
originally
have
meant
member
of
the
tribe
as
in
the
avestan
compound
mogutbish
hostile
to
a
member
of
the
tribe
this
meaning
would
have
been
further
resticted
among
the
medes
to
member
of
the
priestly
tribe
and
perhaps
to
priest
benveniste
boyce
the
term
is
probably
of
median
origin
given
that
herodotus
mentions
the
magoi
as
one
of
the
six
tribes
of
the
medes
for
a
variety
of
reasons
we
can
consider
the
magi
to
have
been
members
of
a
priestly
tribe
of
median
origin
in
western
iran
among
the
persians
they
were
responsible
for
liturgical
functions
as
well
as
for
maintaining
their
knowledge
of
the
holy
and
the
occult
most
likely
the
supremacy
of
the
median
priesthood
in
western
iran
became
established
during
the
time
of
the
median
monarchy
that
dominated
the
persians
from
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
through
the
first
half
of
the
sixth
century
bce
until
the
revolt
of
cyrus
the
great
bce
the
persians
were
indebted
to
the
medes
for
their
political
and
civil
institutions
as
well
even
if
hypotheses
have
been
advanced
concerning
the
existence
of
magi
of
persian
origin
in
the
achaemenid
period
boyce
we
must
still
maintain
that
they
were
of
median
origin
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
eposide
of
the
revolt
of
gaumata
the
magian
mentioned
by
darius
i
bce
in
the
inscription
at
bisutun
iran
as
well
as
by
greek
sources
indeed
herodotus
insists
on
the
idea
of
the
usurpatory
power
of
the
medes
against
the
persians
through
the
conspiracy
of
the
magi
the
fact
that
the
magi
may
have
been
members
of
a
tribe
that
handed
down
the
sacerdotal
arts
in
a
hereditary
fashion
naturally
did
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
some
of
them
undertook
secular
prefessions
this
seems
to
be
attested
by
the
elamite
tablets
at
persepolis
there
is
a
theses
put
forth
by
giuseppe
messina
that
denies
that
the
magi
are
members
of
an
ethnic
group
by
suggesting
that
they
are
simply
members
of
the
priesthood
a
priesthood
of
purely
zoroastrian
origin
this
thesis
is
untenable
on
the
other
hand
the
hypothesis
that
their
name
is
related
to
the
avestan
term
magavan
derived
from
the
gathic
maga
vedic
magha
gift
is
not
without
foundation
mole
the
meaning
of
maga
can
probably
be
found
in
conformity
with
the
pahlavi
tradition
within
the
context
of
the
concept
of
purity
or
separation
of
the
mixture
of
the
two
opposed
principles
of
spirit
and
matter
the
maga
which
has
been
erroneously
interpreted
as
chorus
from
the
root
mangh
which
is
said
to
mean
sing
the
magic
song
nyberg
and
has
been
rendered
simply
by
an
expression
like
unio
mystica
seems
to
be
an
ecstatic
condition
that
opens
the
mind
to
spiritual
vision
in
any
case
though
there
may
be
a
relation
between
the
old
persian
term
magu
and
the
avestan
terms
magavan
and
maga
we
must
maintain
a
clear
distinction
between
the
magi
and
the
avestan
priesthood
the
avesta
ignores
the
median
or
old
persian
term
despite
a
recent
hypothesis
proposed
by
hw
bailey
old
persian
inscriptions
ignore
the
avestan
term
for
priest
athravan
vedic
athravan
even
if
this
is
perhaps
present
in
an
achaeminid
setting
in
the
elamite
tablets
of
persepolis
gershevitch
the
term
magu
has
been
present
in
zoroastrianism
throughout
its
history
the
pahlavi
terms
moghmard
and
mobad
represent
its
continuation
the
latter
in
particular
derives
from
an
older
form
magupati
head
of
the
magi
during
the
sasanid
period
third
to
seventh
centuries
ce
which
saw
the
formation
of
a
hierarchically
organized
church
the
title
mobadan
mobad
the
high
priest
of
high
priests
came
to
be
used
to
designate
the
summit
of
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
the
magi
practiced
consanguineous
marriage
or
khvaetvadatha
av
pahl
khwedodah
they
also
performed
a
characteristic
funeral
rite
the
exposure
of
the
corpse
to
animals
and
vultures
to
remove
the
flesh
and
thereby
cleanse
it
the
corpse
was
not
supposed
to
decompose
lest
it
be
contaminated
by
the
demons
of
putrefaction
this
practice
later
became
typical
of
the
entire
zoroastrian
community
and
led
to
the
rise
of
a
complex
funeral
ritual
in
iran
and
among
the
parsis
in
india
stone
towers
known
as
dakhmas
were
built
especially
for
this
rite
during
the
time
of
herodotus
the
practice
of
exposure
of
the
corpse
was
in
vogue
only
among
the
magi
the
persians
generally
sprinkled
the
corpse
with
wax
then
buried
it
the
practice
was
widespread
however
among
the
peoples
of
central
asia
the
magi
were
the
technicians
of
and
experts
on
worship
it
was
impossible
to
offer
sacrifices
without
the
presence
of
a
magus
during
the
performance
of
a
ritual
sacrifice
the
magus
sang
of
the
theogony
the
magi
were
possibly
the
custodians
of
a
tradition
of
sacred
poetry
but
we
know
nothing
about
the
relationship
of
this
tradition
to
the
various
parts
of
the
avesta
and
was
called
upon
to
interpret
dreams
and
to
divine
the
future
the
magi
were
also
known
for
the
practice
of
killing
harmful
or
ahrimanical
animals
khrafstra
such
as
snakes
and
ants
they
dressed
in
the
median
style
wearing
pants
tunics
and
coats
with
sleeves
they
wore
a
characteristic
head
covering
of
felt
gr
tiara
with
strips
on
the
sides
that
could
be
used
to
cover
the
nose
and
mouth
during
rituals
to
avoid
contaminating
consecrated
objects
with
their
breath
boyce
the
color
of
these
caps
in
conformity
with
a
tradition
that
is
probably
of
indoeuropean
origin
according
to
georges
dumezil
was
that
of
the
priesthood
white
in
all
likelihood
during
the
achaemenid
period
the
magi
were
not
in
possession
of
a
welldefined
body
of
doctrine
and
it
is
probable
that
they
gradually
adopted
zoroastrianism
they
were
most
likely
a
clergy
consisting
of
professional
priests
who
were
not
tied
to
a
rigid
orthodoxy
but
were
naturally
inclined
to
eclecticism
and
syncretism
nonetheless
they
must
have
been
jealous
guardians
of
the
patrimony
of
zorastrian
traditions
by
virtue
of
this
they
were
the
educators
of
the
royal
princes
the
wisest
of
them
was
responsible
for
teaching
the
prince
the
magic
of
zarathushtra
son
of
horomazes
and
thus
the
cult
of
the
gods
magi
who
excelled
in
other
virtues
were
entrusted
with
the
education
of
the
prince
so
that
he
would
learn
to
be
just
courageous
and
master
of
himself
during
the
achaemenid
period
the
magi
maintained
a
position
of
great
influence
although
they
were
certainly
subordinate
to
the
emperor
despite
several
dramatic
events
such
as
the
massacre
they
suffered
after
the
death
of
gaumata
the
magian
in
which
according
to
herodotus
who
calls
himself
smerdis
the
persians
killed
a
large
number
of
magi
to
avenge
the
usurpation
the
magi
nevertheless
managed
to
maintain
their
influence
at
court
in
media
in
persia
and
in
the
various
regions
of
the
empire
where
they
were
stationed
as
a
consequence
of
the
persian
civilian
and
military
administration
no
priesthood
of
antiquity
was
more
famous
than
that
of
the
magi
they
were
renowned
as
followers
of
zarathushtra
zoroaster
as
the
teachers
of
some
of
the
greatest
greek
thinkers
pythagoras
democritus
plato
as
the
wise
men
who
arrived
guided
by
a
star
at
the
manger
of
the
newborn
savior
in
bethlehem
and
as
the
propagators
of
a
cult
of
the
sun
in
india
but
they
were
also
known
as
the
chaldeans
the
priesthood
of
babylon
known
for
its
occultism
this
was
perhaps
the
reason
that
the
term
magos
had
a
pejorative
sense
in
greek
like
goes
expert
in
the
magic
arts
bidez
and
cumont
indeed
the
chaldeans
were
experts
in
all
types
of
magical
arts
especially
astrology
and
had
a
reputation
for
wisdom
as
well
as
knowledge
to
understand
the
reasons
for
such
various
and
sometimes
discordant
views
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
the
magi
of
iran
proper
and
the
socalled
western
magi
who
were
later
hellenized
in
the
achaemenid
period
both
must
have
been
at
least
in
part
zoroastrian
but
the
western
magi
those
of
the
iranian
diaspora
in
asia
minor
syria
mesopotamia
and
armenia
who
came
in
contact
with
diverse
religious
traditions
must
have
sooner
or
later
and
in
varying
degrees
been
influenced
by
syncretic
concepts
the
greeks
were
familiar
with
both
kinds
of
magi
and
depending
on
their
varying
concerns
would
emphasize
one
or
the
other
aspect
of
them
classical
historians
and
geographers
including
herodotus
and
strabo
document
their
customs
while
the
philosophers
dwell
above
all
on
their
doctrines
dualism
belief
in
the
hereafter
magian
cosmology
and
cosmogony
and
their
theology
and
eschatology
those
sources
most
interested
in
the
doctrines
of
the
magi
even
speak
of
zarathushtra
as
a
magus
in
doing
so
they
are
repeating
what
the
magi
themselves
said
from
the
median
and
achaemenid
periods
when
they
adopted
zoroastrianism
at
that
time
they
embraced
zarathushtra
as
one
of
their
own
and
placed
themselves
under
his
venerable
name
zoroastrianism
had
already
undergone
several
profound
transformations
in
the
eastern
community
by
the
time
of
the
acheamenids
and
was
already
adapting
those
elements
of
the
archaic
religion
that
refused
to
die
it
has
been
said
quite
often
in
an
attempt
to
characterize
the
precise
role
of
the
magi
in
the
zoroastrian
tradition
that
the
vendidad
from
vidaevodata
the
lawabjuring
daivas
part
of
the
avesta
should
be
attributed
to
them
this
collection
of
texts
from
various
periods
is
primarily
concerned
with
purificatory
rules
and
practices
nonetheless
the
hypothesis
is
hardly
plausible
since
the
first
chapter
of
the
vendidad
a
list
of
sixteen
lands
created
by
ahura
mazda
the
supreme
god
of
zoroastrianism
but
contaminated
by
an
attack
by
ahriman
pahl
gathicavestan
angra
mainyu
the
other
supreme
god
and
the
ultimate
source
of
all
evil
and
suffering
does
not
mention
western
iran
persia
or
media
the
land
of
ragha
mentioned
in
the
text
cannot
be
median
raghiana
furthermore
it
has
been
noted
gershevitch
that
if
the
authors
had
been
magi
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
western
iranian
institutions
including
their
own
priesthood
would
be
very
strange
the
magi
were
above
all
the
means
by
which
the
zoroastrian
tradition
and
the
corpus
of
the
avesta
have
been
transmitted
to
us
from
the
second
half
of
the
first
millennium
bce
on
this
has
been
their
principal
merit
we
can
attribute
directly
to
the
magi
the
new
formulation
that
iranian
dualism
assumed
known
to
us
especially
from
greek
sources
and
in
part
from
the
pahlavi
literature
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
ce
according
to
this
formulation
the
two
poles
of
the
dualism
are
no
longer
as
in
the
gathas
spenta
mainyu
beneficent
spirit
and
angra
mainyu
hostile
spirit
but
ahura
mazda
himself
and
angra
mainyu
gershevitch
see
ahura
mazda
and
angra
mainyu
this
trans
formation
was
of
immense
consequence
for
the
historical
development
of
zoro
astrianism
and
was
most
likely
determined
by
the
contact
of
the
magi
with
the
mesopotamian
religious
world
in
this
new
dualism
which
was
that
later
known
to
the
greeks
aristotle
eudemus
of
rhodes
theopompus
and
others
we
can
see
the
affirmation
of
a
new
current
of
thought
within
zoroastrianism
to
which
we
give
the
name
zurvanism
see
zurvanism
thanks
to
their
adherence
to
zoroastrianism
the
magi
played
an
enormously
important
role
in
the
transmission
of
zarathushtras
treachings
as
well
as
in
the
definition
of
the
new
forms
that
these
would
assume
historically
their
natural
propensity
to
eclecticism
and
syncretism
also
helped
the
diffusion
of
zoroastrian
ideas
in
the
communities
of
the
iranian
diaspora
the
greeks
began
to
study
their
doctrines
and
to
take
an
interest
in
them
xanthus
of
lydia
hermodorus
aristotle
theopompus
hermippus
dinon
even
writing
treatises
on
the
persian
religion
of
which
only
the
titles
and
a
few
fragments
have
survived
in
the
hellenistic
period
the
magi
were
seen
as
a
secular
school
of
wisdom
and
writings
on
magic
astrology
and
alchemy
were
lent
the
authority
of
such
prestigious
names
as
zarathushtra
ostanes
and
hystaspes
forming
an
abundant
apocryphal
literature
bidez
and
cumont
later
still
eschatology
and
apocalyptics
were
a
fertile
meeting
ground
for
iranian
and
judeochristian
religions
as
can
be
seen
in
the
famous
oracles
of
hystaspes
a
work
whose
iranian
roots
are
undeniable
and
which
most
likely
dates
from
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
probably
the
second
century
ce
widengren
the
zoroastrian
doctrine
of
the
savior
of
the
future
saoshyant
was
the
basis
for
the
story
of
the
coming
of
the
magi
to
bethlehem
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
see
saoshyant
the
sasanid
period
saw
the
magi
once
again
play
a
determining
role
in
the
religious
history
of
iran
concerned
to
win
back
the
western
magi
de
menasce
and
eager
to
consolidate
zoroastrianism
as
the
national
religion
of
iran
the
priests
of
iranian
sanctuaries
in
media
and
persia
were
able
to
establish
a
true
state
church
strongly
hierarchical
and
endowed
with
an
orthodoxy
based
on
the
formation
of
a
canon
of
scriptures
the
leading
figures
in
the
development
of
a
state
religion
and
of
zoroastrian
orthodoxy
were
tosar
and
kerder
the
persecutors
of
mani
in
the
third
century
saoshyant
the
avestan
term
saoshyant
future
benefactor
mpers
soshans
designates
the
savior
of
the
world
who
will
arrive
at
a
future
time
to
redeem
humankind
the
concept
of
the
future
savior
is
one
of
the
fundamental
notions
of
zoro
astrianism
together
with
that
of
dualism
it
appears
as
early
as
in
the
gathas
zarathushtra
zoroaster
as
the
prophet
of
the
religion
is
himself
a
sao
shyant
one
who
performs
his
works
for
the
frashokereti
the
end
of
the
present
state
of
the
world
when
existence
will
be
rehabilitated
and
made
splendid
see
frashokereti
later
zoroastrian
doctrine
developed
this
notion
into
a
true
eschatological
myth
and
expanded
the
number
of
saoshyants
from
one
to
three
all
the
saviors
are
born
from
the
seed
of
zarathushtra
which
is
preserved
through
the
ages
in
lake
kansaoya
identified
with
presentday
lake
helmand
in
seistan
iran
protected
by
fravashis
or
guardian
spirits
the
greatest
of
the
awaited
saoshyants
the
victorious
astvatereta
he
who
embodies
truth
the
son
of
the
vispataurvairi
she
who
conquers
all
is
the
third
who
will
make
existence
splendid
he
appears
in
yashts
upon
his
arrival
humankind
will
no
longer
be
subject
to
old
age
death
or
corruption
and
will
be
granted
unlimited
power
at
that
time
the
dead
will
be
resurrected
and
the
living
will
be
immortal
and
indestructable
brandishing
the
weapon
with
which
he
kills
the
powerful
enemies
of
the
world
of
truth
that
is
the
world
of
the
spirit
and
of
asha
astvatereta
will
look
upon
the
whole
of
corporeal
existence
and
render
it
imperishable
he
and
his
comrades
will
engage
in
a
great
battle
with
the
forces
of
evil
which
will
be
destroyed
the
name
astvatereta
is
clearly
the
result
of
theological
speculation
kellens
as
are
those
of
his
two
brothers
ukhshyatereta
he
who
makes
truth
grow
and
ukhshyatnemah
he
who
makes
reverence
grow
the
names
of
the
three
virgins
yashts
who
are
impregnated
with
the
seed
of
zarathushtra
when
they
bathe
in
lake
kansaoya
and
give
birth
to
the
saoshyants
are
equally
speculative
each
of
these
saoshyants
will
arrive
at
the
beginning
of
a
millennium
initiating
a
new
age
and
a
new
cycle
of
existence
astvatereta
will
appear
in
the
third
and
final
millennium
to
save
mankind
the
doctrine
of
the
future
savior
had
already
taken
shape
in
the
archaemenid
period
sixth
to
fourth
century
bce
it
was
not
perhaps
the
principal
element
in
the
formation
of
the
messianic
idea
but
it
was
certainly
a
determining
factor
one
that
enjoyed
great
success
in
the
hellenistic
period
beyond
the
confines
of
the
iranian
world
a
similar
concept
that
of
the
future
buddha
maitreya
was
most
likely
indebted
to
it
and
christian
messianism
can
trace
its
roots
to
the
same

it
looks

that

we

i

what
about

so
are
you
happy
now
when
people
including
innocent
kids
died
today
its
amazing
how
everyone
automatically
blames
one
side
or
the
other
one
thing
for
sure
koresh
will
have
no
chance
to
defend
himself
against

made
by
agents
who
participated
in
the
situation
that
killed
him
i
dont
know
they
murdered
him
i
also
dont
know
that
the
branch
davidians
set
a
fire
and
suicidede
it
is
sick
of
batf
or
fbi
spokepeople
to
make
such
comments
in

of
forensic
pathology
stephen
thank
you
god
speed
no
kinda
numb
i
thought
something
like
this
was
going
to
happen
over
a
week
ago
one
of
the
things
thats
been
obvious
from
the
yah
start
is
that
when
there
are
two
armed
camps
neither
of
which
yields
its
usually
get
slaughtered
when
any
little
spark
sets
it
off
which
is
why
koresh
and
company
shouldnt
have
stockpiled
weapons
and
why
the
batf
shouldnt
have
come
primed
for
a
raid
bingo
am
i
the
only
one
to
notice
a
no
peaceful
attempt
to
serve
a
warrant
b
six
months
to
develop
a
scene
and
six
days
to
end
it
c
ah
god
children
at
least
adults
plus
at
the
beginning
and
more
batf
agents
all
dead
painful
point
if
the
davidians
fired
first
why
were
the
batf
on
the
roof
rather
than
taking
cover
has
anyone
asked
themselves
these
questions
have
you
seen
the
entire
video
sequences
taken
during
the
opening
rounds
i
seem
to
recall
missing
several
key
parts
a
the
first
five
minutes
of
day
one
only
the
shooting
part
comes
out
b
what
happened
to
the
feds
video
units
you
mean
they
do
not
carry
helmet
cams
wonder
why
not
how
is
it
you
can
have
camera
crews
with
live
transmission
video
present
and
not
have
an
uninterrupted
record
a
you
realize
the
units
carry
ittle
bitty
backups
that
hold
minutes
per
unit
and
there
are
twounits
on
the
professional
handhelds
so
no
tape
turnover
gaps
b
until
all
views
are
seen
it
is
premature
to
point
fingers
in
either
direction
as
you
well
point
out
stephen
anyone
batf
bd
xbd
other
could
have
touched
it
off
by
mistake
or
maliciously
more
on
this
below
once
koresh
was
shot
disregarding
his
being
a
religious
leader
and
apocalyptically
obsessed
most
likely
the
people
inside
just
went
on
drill
just
like
the
batf
outside
is
the
lesson
that
automatic
responses
are
very
hazardous
last
resort
measures
yes
but
it
is
so
hard
toremain
human
under
the
full
pressure
of
hazard
game
playing
and
life
painful
point
either
side
could
have
backed
off
to
help
defuse
the
situation
we
see
the
problem
constantly
here
on
the
net
with
flaming
ego
problems
nuff
said
more
to
the
point
when
someone
dies
almost
like
it
was
intended
that
way
both
sides
will
kill
to
maintain
their
innocence
a
contradiction
in
terms
painful
point
it
doesnt
help
to
take
sides
in
such
a
situation
just
adds
fuel
to
the
fire
better
is
to
let
it
burn
out
on
its
own
true
usually
i
pick
the
unpopular
side
and
point
out
from
the
evidence
seen
what
might
have
alternatively
happened
best
example
i
can
think
of
is
christ
with
the
tax
coin
he
didnt
have
one
and
so
didnt
sanction
the
roman
authority
unduly
when
they
showed
it
to
him
he
noted
that
it
was
caesars
minting
and
so
said
give
it
to
him
no
waste
of
time
and
then
he
got
back
to
more
worthwhile
concerns
gods
will
this
requires
someone
interested
in
gods
will
please
note
that
the
outstanding
overt
problem
in
this
country
today
is
one
where
the
government
wants
caesars
coin
to
pay
off
the
debt
the
antitax
movement
of
today
and
the
antissanasid
groups
would
do
well
to
note
who
the
issuing
authority
is
ditto
for
those
yes
the
american
people
not
the
federal
government
and
if
it
is
not
spent
towards
that
end
noone
deserves
the
coin
made
in
the
image
of
god
yah
fewpeople
hear
the
contradiction
money
made
in
the
image
of
god
no
need
to
stir
things
up
in
ever
larger
revorevorevolution
as
governments
turn
over
and
over
and
over
i
wish
you
were
wrong
many
pundits
are
saying
years
the
onyl
good
thing
to
come
out
of
my
divorce
and
my
exposure
to
the
damned
pardon
me
american
divorce
attorney
is
i
have
no
money
left
to
lose
to
taxes
or
inflation
painful
point
for
many
this
was
just
entertainment
thumbsup
thumbsdown
just
another
thriller
like
terminator
or
a
goodold
ball
game
is
the
lesson
that
weve
become
jaded
to
media
reality
children
dead
if
anyone
thinks
blaming
koresh
or
the
batf
helps
this
any
at
all
is
sick
and
wrong
the
reason
you
can
tell
that
the
batf
may
not
be
entirely
straight
on
this
is
that
the
leaders
at
press
conferences
havew
made
any
comments
about
even
the
possibility
that
koresh
or
his
followers
caused
this
the
batf
agentss
are
more
concerned
with
their
repuations
and
morals
not
my
fault
koresh
did
it
than
they
are
with
dead
children
same
goes
for
koresh
his
followers
who
are
all
mostly
dead
painful
point
la
burned
the
davidians
burned
in
one
case
society
has
abandoned
the
people
which
has
returned
to
a
frontier
in
the
other
the
outskirts
were
bumping
against
the
suburbs
is
the
lesson
that
whats
lawful
in
different
areas
of
society
depends
more
on
conditions
than
laws
more
on
power
and
favoritism
my
personal
opinion
look
to
history
whenever
privilege
has
replaced
whatever
token
of
objective
law
and
justice
a
society
has
had
hitlerrs
have
followed
if
we
dont
learnthelessons
or
at
least
make
an
honest
effort
the
next
conflagration
will
no
doubt
be
closer
to
home
rather
than
putting
out
fires
arent
there
much
more
important
concerns
for
us
to
work
on
you
do
your
name
sake
proud
stephen
its
hard
but
please
keep
on
keeping
on
each
voice
in
the
wilderness
now
will
save
a
generation
unborn
from
horror
kent
who
cant
cheers
today
exactly
what
keeps
me
from
being
a
bombthrower
is
my
loving
god
as
irra
tional
as
that
is
for
so
many
one
direct
benefit
is
being
able
to
keep
things
in
perspective
ks
the
day
i
need
a
gun
or
abomb
to
protect
myself
in
this
society
is
the
day
that
society
is
already
beyond
redemption
and
that
aint
redundant
if
you
have
any
christian
belief
aytall
and
the
day
that
i
cannot
peacefully
enjoin
others
in
the
act
that
thoreau
called
civil
disobedience
to
rectify
the
wrongs
that
my
society
practises
without
undue
harm
or
punishment
befalling
me
is
the
day
that
society
has
ceased
to
be
a
human
society
and
become
a
society
of
animals
we
are
very
cclose
to
that
such
as
who
hurts
more
the
ones
who
died
or
the
loved
ones
who
are
left
besides
the
lessons
its
also
time
for
many
to
grieve
including
those
whove
lost
their
faith
in
others
or
in
god
im
learning
to
be
patient
and
let
things
heal
god
willing
six
years
fighting
an
unjust
court
issue
still
struggling
to
be
patient
for
those
who
like
contrary
questions
nb
i
was
not
there
i
am
not
a
branch
davidian
nor
a
law
official
hater
i
do
hate
liars
or
the
six
letter
variety
of
same
the
official
side
has
its
advocates
already
lets
balance
the
equation
and
asj
a
few
questions
on
the
other
side
for
the
sake
of
an
old
saw
the
batf
abd
fbi
seem
to
want
to
bypass
innocent
until
proven
guilty
not
innocent
until
presumed
guilty
where
are
the
video
tapes
from
the
tanks
all
of
them
dont
tell
me
they
do
not
exist
they
are
standard
equipment
so
you
think
koresh
fired
the
place
because
of
the
explosion
a
tear
gas
comes
with
an
aerosol
to
spread
it
this
aerosol
is
deliberately
made
to
be
as
nonflammable
as
possible
it
is
as
nonflammable
as
possible
gotcha
when
in
isolation
from
other
substances
why
was
a
pipe
deliveryu
system
used
rather
than
remote
launchers
why
did
the
fbi
not
announce
this
window
blown
in
plus
tear
gas
five
minutes
then
the
wall
come
down
and
maintain
a
left
to
right
sequence
b
most
aerosols
also
have
a
secondary
compound
that
when
mixed
in
becomes
a
very
flammable
and
difficult
to
trace
suspension
with
a
very
special
property
exposure
to
brief
eruptions
of
high
heat
muzzle
blasts
or
long
exposure
to
low
heat
matches
a
stove
will
not
tend
to
ignite
what
other
chemicals
come
up
in
the
forensics
who
else
will
be
allowed
to
test
the
site
c
after
a
few
minutes
to
hours
ifdesired
the
combnation
rate
can
be
controlled
as
desired
the
mixture
can
be
made
to
become
veryignitable
onb
exposure
to
a
temperature
above
a
certain
point
a
tracer
round
for
a
certain
heat
quantity
a
small
explosive
charge
or
for
a
length
of
time
start
a
wall
fire
and
wait
check
your
military
records
look
at
the
tapes
why
were
tanks
large
capacity
delivey
systems
tear
gas
why
not
somnorifics
and
now
why
the
hurry
was
there
still
a
comm
channel
open
to
the
outside
do
you
see
any
trace
of
fire
coming
back
to
the
compound
in
the
videos
all
the
videos
which
ones
are
missing
do
i
sound
paranoid
maybe
am
i
probably
not
you
trust
the
fbi
and
batf
to
render
judgement
in
advance
of
a
court
god
help
us
for
we
are
surely
not
helping
ourselves
you
trut
the
federal
gevernment
to
give
us
a
clean
slate
you
are
trillion
admitted
down
and
counting
look
again
did
it
happen
that
way
i
do
not
know
i
was
not
there
and
it
should
wait
for
a
court
to
decide
but
will
that
happen
people
will
not
have
the
chance
to
tell
their

as
the

re
question
on
sabbath
question
correction
there
are
a
few
groups
that
continue
to
believe
christians
have
to
worship
on
the
sabbath
saturday
the
bestknown
are
the
seventhday
adventists
and
jehovahs
witnesses
they
argue
that
act
is
not
a
regular
worship
service
but
a
special
meeting
to
see
paul
off
and
that
i
cor
doesnt
explicitly
say
its
a
regular
worship
service
jehovahs
witnesses
do
not
believe
that
christians
are
required
to
observe
the
sabbath
whether
it
is
on
saturday
or
sunday
the
sabbath
was
part
of
a
covenent
between
god
and
the
israelites
and
is
not
required
for
christians

the

i

it

to
stop

and
see
that
there
are
still
people
in
the

that
forced

my

persecution
in

im
willing
to
admit
that
members
of
other
churches
are
christians
if
they
believe
in
christ
and
try
to
follow
his
teachings
even
though
they
have
different
interpretations
of
the

and
yet
these
other
churches
often
go
out
of
their
way
to
define
whether
or
not
i
am
considered

christian
could
someone
mail
me
a
set

rulesbeliefs
that
must
be
followed

does
this

rules
exclude
other
large

i
know
this
is
a
waste
of

this

probably
been

times

im

there
have

that

are

the

its
my

either
way
i
am
my

i
choose
what
i
want
to
do
i
weigh
the
benefits
of
my
actions
against
their
consequences
and
i
use
my
experience
to
help
me
deal
with
the
unexpected
which
in
turn
make
me
more
experienced
i
dont
always
succeed
but
i
never
fail
either
i
learn
do
you
have
any
habits
you
cant
break
why
not
for
one
you
seem
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
bible
i
have
arrived
at
my
own
understanding
of
christianity
just
as
youve
probably
arrived
at
your
own
understanding
of
islam
that
is
most
likely
very
different
from
the
way
a
moslem
thinks
of
his
religion
are
you
unable
to
master
your
lack
of
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
the
quran
if
thats
different
then
how
is
it
different
from
what
you
accuse
me
of
can
i
accuse
you
of
having
no
desire
to
understand
even
the
slightest
concept
of
atheism
how
about
sexual
sins
gotta
any
of
those
secret
desires
in
your
head
that
you
harbor
but
can
get
control
of
do
you
dehumanize
women
when
they
walk
past
you
do
you
degrade
them
to
a
sex
object
in
your
head
of
course
not
thats
disgusting
for
centuries
religions
have
been
discriminating
on
sex
and
treating
women
as
secondclass
humans
thats
one
of
the
reasons
i
renounced
my
christianity
do
you
insult
people
unknowingly
then
regret
it
later
yet
do
it
again
the
next
time
opportunity
presents
itself
no
i
dont
insult
people
period
its
not
in
my
nature
and
its
not
something
that
i
want
to
do
either
are
you
truly
the
master
of
yourself
not
yet
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practice
on
the
fun
is
in
the
getting
there
i
have
admitted
that
i
am
not
the
master
of
my
thought
life
at
all
times
that
i
sometimes
say
things
i
do
want
to
say
and
then
repeat
my
mistake
unwantingly
i
have
admitted
to
myself
that
i
cannot
control
every
aspect
of
my
being
there
are
times
i
know
i
shouldnt
say
something
but
then
say
it
anyway
there
are
times
i
simply
forget
a
lesson
i
in
fact
am
not
my
own
master
we
dont
start
out
perfect
weve
got
to
strive
to
be
something
better
i
know
my
shortcomings
and
i
know
my
strengths
and
i
live
my
life
according
to
the
decisions
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
i
need
help
jesus
promised
me
this
help
and
i
took
him
up
on
his
offer
i
have
willfully
let
jesus
be
my
master
because
jesus
knows
what
is
better
for
me
than
i
myself
do
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
do
you
see
my
point
i
think
youre
the
one
under
the
rock
and
im
getting
a
great
tan
out
here
in
the
sunlight
my
life
has
improved
immesurably
since
i
abandoned
theism
come
and
join
me
it
will
be
a
difficult
trip
at
first
until
you
build
up
your
muscles
for
the
long
hike
but
its
well
worth
it
then
i
guess
ignorance
is
bliss
for
you
because
brian
you
enjoy
not
having
a
clue
about
the
bible
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
dont
you
see
im
not
going
to
accept
anything
that
i
cant
witness
with
my
own
eyes
or
experience
with
my
own
senses
especially
not
something
as
megapowerful
as
what
youre
trying
to
get
me
to
accept
surely
if
you
believe
in
it
this
strongly
you
must
have
a
good
reason
to
dont
you
can
you
witness
motherly
love
with
your
senses
how
does
caring
and
concern
for
you
register
with
your
senses
if
nothing
registers
to
you
other
than
what
you
can
see
taste
smell
hear
and
touch
then
you
better
become
a
vulcan
and
fast
you
better
get
rid
of
your
emotions
huh
youre
going
way
off
the
track
here
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
my
god
says
that
you
will
not
cease
existing
you
have
life
forever
you
can
choose
to
either
live
it
in
hell
in
eternal
torment
where
there
is
no
communication
whatsoever
or
can
choose
to
live
it
in
paradise
with
god
that
is
what
my
god
says
and
that
was
the
issue
your
madeup
theism
is
what
it
ismade
up
its
wishful
thinking
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no
matter
how
powerful
it
is
note
also
that
there
are
several
gods
trying
to
lure
me
this
way
yahweh
allah
zeus
odin
ra
please
give
me
a
solid
reason
to
choose
one
of
them

the

hee
hee
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstrates
that
you
havent
listened
to
a
single
word
ive
said
have
you
ever
gone
to
an
amusement
park
why
i
mean
after
a
few
hours
it
closes
and
nothings
different
except
that
youre
a
few
dollars
lighter
going
to
the
amusement
park
doesnt
do
you
any
good
at
all
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
the
answer
is
that
you
think
its
fun
you
play
the
skeeball
over
and
over
because
youd
like
to
get
better
at
it
even
though
youre
not
going
to
win
anything
better
than
a
stuffed
animal
even
if
you
blow
ten
dollars
on
it
you
ride
the
roller
coaster
because
its
an
thrilling
experience
even
though
because
it
scares
the
dickens
out
of
you
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
forget
the
bible
for
a
minute
forget
quoting
verses
forget
about
who
said
what
about
this
or
that
show
me
picture
just
you
and
me
and
a
wide
open
hilltop
and
convince
me
that
youre
right
forget
that
i
am
a
person
forget
that
i
know
how
to
type
forget
that
i
know
how
to
put
a

together
forget
that
i
know
how
to
send
email
forget
my
existence
proove
to
me
that
i
exist
i
cant
do
it
because
your
existence
means
nothing
more
to
me
than
just
your
communications
over
the
net
you
have
no
more
bearing
on
nor
importance
in
my
life
than
that
remove
it
and
you
will
cease
to
be
significant
to
me
are
you
thereby
inferring
that
your
deity
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
verses
in
a
book
and
cannot
be
supported
without
invoking
them
or
do
you
mean
that
the
existence
of
your

and
in

any
other

that

the

talkorigins

of

another
debate
that
was
nothing

an
attempt
at
mindless
bullying
and
factless
assertion
by
a
standardissue
creationist
the

reflects
that
the
behavior
reported
reminds
him
of
some
christian
groups
he
has
known
i
believe
that
the
writer
is
a
nonhomosexual
christian
there
is
a
very
effective
technique
used
to
promote
unit
cohesion
among
the
soldiers
of
the
lord
it
is
called
witnessing
ive
seen
this
process
used
well
and
poorly
the
near
devil
worship
i
mention
was
a
group
that
was
using
the
witnessing
to
get
people
lathered
up
to
go
kill
homosexuals
or
at
least
terrorize
them
off

as
it
was
clearly
gods

that
they
do

originally

i
learned
that
a

cannot
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his
jr
death
bed
because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling
of

it

requires
faith
in

proven
by
following
him
by
keeping
his

such
cannot

are
not
the

thing
salvation
is

refer

i
responded
to

that
rw
i
dont
see
the
effort
to
equate
salvation
with

rw
rw
rather
i
see
implied
the
fact
that
only
those
who
are
saved
rw
may
enter
paradise
to
which
kermit
wrote
kt
incomplete
reference
kt
kt
see
also
the
discussion
did
jesus
go
into
hell
in
the
biblestudy
group
kt
for
the
arguments
that
paradise
and
hellsheol
are
places
after
death
kt
the
discussion
no
lds
were
involved
as
far
as
i
could
see
argued
using
kt
standard
christian
argument
from
the
bible
that
pretty
much
support
the
kt
lds
position
kt
kt
christ
went
to
paridise
after
his
death
and
burial
kt
kt
he
taught
the
prisoners
and
freed
them
from
darkness
kt
kt
when
he
was
resurrected
he
had
not
yet
ascended
to
his
father
kt
kt
the
arguement
centered
around
what
was
or
wasnt
the
proper
biblical
kt
terms
for
those
places
i
respond
the
question
that
was
raised
was
not
if
jesus
went
to
infernal
paradise
before
entering
into

no
one
has
made

welcomed

in

and

bearing

of

miracles
now
it
would
require
a
voluminous
work
to
mention
all
his
miracles
as
the
punctilious
scholars
have
written
many
volumes
concerning
the
proofs
of
his
prophethood
here
we
will
briefly
point
out
only
the
general
category
into
which
fall
fhe
miracles
that
are
definite
and
accepted
as
accurate
reports
the
evidences
of
the
prophethood
of
muhammad
saw
fall
into
two
main
categories
the
first
is
called
irhasat
and
includes
the
paranormal
events
that
happened
at
the
time
of
his
birth
or
before
his
declaration
of
prophethood
the
second
group
pertains
to
all
the
remaining
evidences
of
the
prophethood
and
contains
two
subdivisions
those
wonders
that
were
manifested
after
his
departure
from
this
world
in
order
to
confirm
his
prophethood
and
those
that
he
exhibited
during
the
era
of
his
prophethood
the
latter
has
also
two
parts
the
evidences
of
his
prophethood
that
became
manifest
in
his
own
personality
his
inner
and
outer
being
his
moral
conduct
and
perfection
and
the
miracles
that
related
to
substantial
matters
the
last
part
again
has
two
branches
those
concerning
the
quran
and
spirituality
and
those
relating
to
matter
and
creation
this
last
branch
is
again
divided
into
two
categories
the
first
involves
the
paranormal
happenings
that
occured
during
his
mission
either
to
break
the
stubbornness
of
the
unbelievers
or
to
augment
the
faith
of
the
belivers
this
category
has
twenty
different
sorts
such
as
the
splitting
of
the
moon
the
flowing
of
water
from
the
fingers
the
satisfying
of
large
numbers
with
a
little
food
and
the
speaking
of
trees
rocks
and
animals
each
of
these
sons
has
also
many
instances
and
thus
has
in
meaning
the
strength
of
confirmation
by
consensus
as
for
the
second
category
this
includes
events
lying
in
the
future
that
occured
as
he
had
predicted
upon
allah
swts
instructions
now

from

please
i
dont

most
christians
believe

however
we
are
not

by
adherence
to
the

the
law
exists
to
tell
us
what
is
sinful
we
all
sin
hence
we
are
all
above
the

where
all
in
this
case
refers

christians
jews
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
with

sacrifice
of
animals
as
described
in
the
old
testament
when
was
the
last
time
you
heard
about
a
jewish
animal
sacrifice
christians
believe
that
their
sins
are
atoned
for
by
the
blood
sacrifice
of
jesus
the
blood
sacrifice
of
an
innocent
man
this
does
not
make
the
law
irrelevant
then
why
dont
christians
follow
it
why
dont
they
even
follow
their
own
ten
commandments
breaking
the
law
is
sinful
and
we
are
to
avoid
sinful
ways
but
sinning
by
itself
does
not
jeopardize
salvation

in

novel

a
scene
in
which
the
son
of
a
roman
nobleman
living
in
britain
takes
part
in
a
secret
ceremony
involving
a
bull
he
stands
naked
in
a
pit
covered
with
some
sort
of
scaffolding
while
assistants
coax
a
bull
to
stand
on
the
scaffolding
they
then
fatally
stab
the
bull
which
douses
the
worshipper
in
the
pit
with
blood
this
is
supposedly
some
sort
of
rite
of
passage
for
members
of
the
bull
cult
i
wonder
if
this
is
related
to
the
mithras
cult
i
dont
know
where
rutherford
got
his
information
for
this
chapter
the
book
is
historical
fiction
and
most
of
the
general
events
which
take
place
are
largely
based
on
historical
accounts
there
is
a
rite
like
this
described
in
joseph
campbells
occidentalmythology
he
also
described
levels
of
initiation
i
think
i
dont
know
where
campbell
got
his
info
but
i
remember
thinking
he
was
being
a
little
eclectic
i
also
wonder
what
if
any
connection
there
is
between
the
ancient
bull
cults
and
the
current
practice
of
bullfighting
popular
in

only
at
a
harsh
rebuke
brian
k
so
far
only
responds
to
the
latter
and
i
am
glad
he
responds
at
all
in
both
cases
of
approach
my
intention
is
to
be
loving
i
am
making
no
excuse
for
myself
if
i
am
coming
across
condesending
i
apologize
for
that
rob
sometimes
brian
k
comes
across
as
honest
i
know
this
but
brian
k
vasillates
back
and
forth
one
post
looks
honest
the
next
is
an
excuse
now
he
wants
me
to
explain
the
universe
in
words
or
less
i
think
brian
kendig
is
really
trying
but
he
is
too
comfortable
with
his
set
of
excuses
i
just
want
brian
k
to
be
honest
with
himself
if
he
really
wants
to
know
he
will
ask
questions
and
stop
asserting
irrelevant
excuses
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
god
i
wish
brian
would
read
the
bible
for
himself
and
come
to
his
own
decisions
without
being
sidetracked
with
the
temptation
to
mock
god
from
my
perspective
rob
when
i
look
at
brian
kendig
i
see
a
man
standing
out
in
the
middle
of
a
highway
off
into
the
distance
i
see
a
mack
truck
heading
right
for
him
but
brian
k
is
faced
away
from
the
oncoming
truck
he
doesnt
see
it
heres
is
how
i
see
the
dialog
me
brian
k
please
step
aside
before
you
get
run
over
bk
there
is
no
truck
me
turn
around
at
look
bk
no
me
look
you
will
be
healthier
if
you
do
take
a
look
at
the
oncoming
truck
bk
no
explain
to
me
why
trucks
exist
me
turn
around
or
you
will
run
over
bk
no
i
wont
because
i
like
hiking
and
tomorrow
is
tuesday
me
you
blind
fool
why
do
you
choose
ignorance
you
have
nothing
to
lose
if
you
look
but
if
do
not
look
you
will
certainly
lose
your
life
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
squashed
all
over
the
road
bk
it
is
my
life
to
lose
i
rather
not
look
besides
a
truck
running
over
me
will
not
harm
me
and
by
the
way
i
really
have
an
open
mind
so
is
my
motivation
to
belittle
brian
or
to
love
brian
the
best
i
know
how
i
do
not
wish
to
single
brian
kendig
out
because
millions
if
not
billions
of
people
fall
into
the
same
category
perhaps
all
people
fall
have
fallen
into
this
category
at
one
time
in
their
lives
i
have
i
can
now
see
the
truck
behind
brian
my
hope
is
that
brian
will
look
and
will
see
the
ramifications
of
the
truck
coming
towards
him
my
hope
is
that
brian
will
want
to
step
out
of
the
way
my
fear
though
is
that
brian
will
instead
choose
to
glue
himself
to
the
middle
of
the
highway
where
he
will
certainly
get
run
over
but
if
he
so
chooses
he
so
chooses
and
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
beyond
that
to
change
his
mind
for
it
is
his
choice
but
at
this
very
moment
brian
hasnt
gotten
even
that
far
he
is
still
at
the
point
where
he
does
not
want
to
look
sure
he
moves
his
eyeball
to
appease
me
but
his
head
will
not
turn
around
to
see
the
entire
picture
so
far
he
is
satisfied
with
his
glimpse
of
the
mountains
off
in
the
distance
thank
you
again
rob
for
your
reproach

really
do
appreciate

you
realize
that
all

and
so
you
rule
out
collaboration
yet
all
of
the
witnesses
tell
of
the
same
god
each
testifier
tells
of
his
own
experiences
with
the
living
god
each
experience
is
different
but
each
experience
has
enough
crossover
to
unmistakenly
reveal
that
each
one
of
these
people
is
talking
about
the
very
same
god
what
daniel
did
not
know
about
god
the
highest
official
of
babylon
god
revealed
to
john
years
laterbut
with
a
different
perspective
no
two
testimonies
are
identical
each
testimony
dares
to
venture
off
what
is
already
known
yet
each
witnesss
testimony
even
though
different
from
those
prior
consistently
describes
harmoniously
fitting
facets

the

i
learned
that
god
loves
his

never

of
him
and
has
a
plan
for
redeeming
them
too
even
those
who
have
died
without
a
knowledge
of
christ
i
learned
that
a
man
cannot
frustrate
justice
by
repenting
on
his
death
bed
because
repentance
is
more
than
a
feeling
of
remorse
it
requires
faith
in
christ
proven
by
following
him
by
keeping
his
commandments
such
cannot
be
accomplished
on

deathbed
so
jesus
must

salvation
is

if
you
can
explain
to
me
why
the
death
of
jesus
was
a
good
thing
then
i
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
and
you
might
even
convert
me
be
warned
however
that
ive
heard
all
the
most
common
arguments
before
and
they
just
dont
convince
me
ask
jesus
himself
he
himself
said
why
in
john
it
isnt
a
mystery
to
anyone
and
there
certainly
is
no
need
for
a
persuasive
argument
read
jesuss
own
reply
to
your
question
john
most
assuredly
i
say
to
you
unless
a
grain
of
wheat
falls
onto
the
ground
and
dies
it
remains
alone
but
if
it
dies
it
produces
much
grain
he
who
loves
his
life
will
lose
it
and
he
who
hates
his
life
in
this
world
will
keep
it
for
eternal
life
if
anyone
serves
me
let
him
follow
me
and
where
i
am
there
my
servant
will
be
also
if
anyone
serves
me
him
my
father
will
honor
why
would
i
want
an
eternal
life
if
i
hate
this
one
if
we
were
created
by
a
deity
why
would
that
deity
not
wish
us
to
enjoy
what
he
has
given
us
why
would
i
want
to
live
forever
the
challenge
in
my
life
is
that
i
will
die
and
that
i
must
give
my
life
the
meaning
i
wish
it
to
have
before
that
happens
my
time
is
here
and
will
someday
pass
i
will
be
content
to
live
on
in
the
memories
of
my
friends
and
once
they
too
are
dead
then
i
will
no
longer
have
any
reason
to
exist
in
short
even
if
your
deity
does
exist
that
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
because
of
my
actions
and
my
choices
if
your
god
decides
to
toss
me
into
a
flaming
pit
for
this
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
cease
to
exist
but
if
your
god
wants
my
respect
and
my
obedience
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
does
then
they
will
be
very
strong
and
true
jesus
gives
more
reasons
in
john
but
one
obvious
reason
why
jesus
died
and
as
with
everything
else
it
has
nothing
do
with
his
punishment
was
that
he
could
rise
to
life
againso
that
we
would
stop
doubting
and
believe
john
the
fact
that
jesus
rose
from
the
dead
is
my
hope
that
i
too
will
rise
from
the
dead
it
is
an
obvious
point
do
not
overlook
it
without
this
obvious
point
i
would
have
no
hope
and
my
faith
would
be
vanity
jesus
wasnt
the
only
one
who
rose
from
the
dead
i
think
it
was
osiris
who
did
the
same
as
well
as
a
few
characters
from
greek
or
norse
legend
if
memory
serves
but
still
why
would
i
want
to
rise
from
the
dead
why
do
you
want
to
why
did
jesus
suffer
in
his
death
again
ask
jesus
jesus
says
why
in
john
thats
no
mystery
either
the
world
hates
him
without
reason
it
is
a
direct
proclamation
of
how
far
we
humans
botch
things
up
and
thus
how
much
we
need
a
saviour
if
your
god
wants
to
win
my
devotion
then
it
knows
what
it
can
do
provide
some
way
for
me
to
believe
without
having
to
resort
to
blind
faith
that
could
be
applied
equally
well
to
any
religion
and
why
cant
you
brian
k
accept
this
how
can
you
the
world
cannot
accept
him
because
it
neither
sees
him
nor
knows
him
john
thats
precisely
it
i
neither
see
nor
know
zeus
either
nor
odin
shall
i
offer
them
the
same
devotion
i
offer
jesus
the
animosity
and
the
lack
of
knowledge
that
comes
out
in
your
twistings
of
roberts
daily
verses
is
very
convincing
testimony
of
the
truth
of
john
and
youve
got
to
understand
my
pointofview
i
see
christians
spouting
bible
verse
all
the
time
as
if
it
were
some
sort
of
magic
spell
that
will
level
all
opposition
truth
is
its
not
robert
has
never
demonstrated
that
he
actually
understands
what
the
verses
imply
he
just
rattles
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenly
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense
and
reality
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
but
even
more
than
that
even
when
christians
do
try
to
explain
the
verses
in
their
own
words
they
do
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
which
is
that
every
human
being
would
want
to
be
a
christian
if
only
he
or
she
understood
the
christian
message
properly
and
then
all
strife
and
suffering
on
the
earth
would
end
heres
the
problem
with
that
substitute
moslem
or
buddhist
or
satanist
instead
of
christian
and
it
means
the
same
thing
christanity
is
a
very
nice
belief
set
around
a
very
nice
book
but
if
you
want
to
make
me
believe
that
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
real
world
youve
got
some
convincing
to
do
i
pray
and
hope
that
i
do
blurt
out
such
animosity
and
lack
of
knowledge
i
am
not
perfect
either
but
regardless
of
that
i
thank
god
that
jesus
revealed
himself
to
me
without
whom
id
also
be
bumbling
about
blindly
though
arrogantly
slandering
the
very
person
who
created
me
and
who
loves
me
and
in
my
opinion
youre
bumbling
about
blindly
making
up
entities
where
there
arent
any
and
depriving
yourself
of
a
true
understanding
and
enjoyment
of
your
life
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beliefs
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
beliefs
to
myself
but
as
soon
as
you
start
waving
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinions
too

hi
all
im
going
to
try
to
do
something
here
that
perhaps
many
would
not
have
thought
even
possible
i
want
to
begin
the
process
of
initiating
a
literary
critical
study
of
the
pornography
posted
on
altsexstories
to
identify
the
major
themes
and
motifs
present
in
the
stories
posted
there
opening
up
then
the
possibility
of
an
objective
moral
evaluation
of
the
material
present
there
first
off
let
me
congratulate
you
for
not
posting
a
flame
about
you
sick
perverts
you
are
immoral
you
are
all
going
to
hell
which
seems
to
be
the
usual
religious
post
found
on
the
altsex
hierarchy
hopefully
you
wont
get
flamed
either
you
will
however
be
argued
with
i
personally
think
that
your
project
is
built
on
unsteady
ground
first
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
way
to
find
an
objective
morality
morality
and
value
are
inherently
subjective
they
represent
the
beliefs
of
a
person
or
a
group
of
people
they
can
be
widely
held
perhaps
even
overwhelmingly
held
but
they
are
never
and
can
never
be
objective
assumptions
a
christian
bedrock
assumption
that
all
that
is
true
comes
truly
from
god
regarding
altsexstories
while
perhaps
even
from
an
objective
standpoint
the
majority
of
its
material
is
indeed
repugnant
you
come
to
this
conclusion
quite
quickly
when
you
start
thinking
about
analyzing
its
material
like
this
some
of
it
reflects
some
fairly
profound
needs
in
people
as
well
as
some
truths
and
deserve
to
be
pointed
out
second
i
do
not
accept
the
assumptions
that
you
make
here
if
as
you
say
you
are
trying
to
be
objective
then
why
accept
a
morality
to
begin
with
by
using
the
christian
bible
youre
defeating
your
own
purpose
by
doing
so
in
the
long
run
the
advantage
of
making
such
a
literarymoral
analysis
is
that
it
will
save
bandwidth
between
christians
and
non
mutually
flaming
each
other
about
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
stuff
on
these
pornographic
groups
third
call
me
a
pessimist
but
you
wont
stop
the
flamage
there
will
always
be
people
who
pop
upin
altsex
to
tell
us
how
sick
and
twisted
and
evil
we
all
are
just
out
of
curiosity
do
altsex
readers
show
up
unprovoked
in
the
religion
groups
to
tell
you
all
that
you
are
narrowminded
censoring
overbearing
totalitarianists
basically
there
should
not
be
a
dissonance
between
a
christian
morality
and
a
nonchristian
one
either
there
is
value
in
a
particular
work
or
there
is
not
whether
one
is
a
christian
or
not
hm
let
me
provide
an
example
four
people
get
together
over
dinner
to
discuss
morality
you
me
a
rather
conservative
moslem
and
a
sociopath
i
start
off
by
saying
that
i
think
its
immoral
to
force
people
to
have
sex
with
you
you
agree
but
also
say
that
it
is
immoral
to
have
sex
with
someone
of
your
own
gender
just
a
note
i
really
dont
know
your
views
on
homosexuality
i
am
just
using
this
as
a
common
view
of
morality
for
the
purposes
of
this
example
the
moslem
says
that
it
is
immoral
for
women
to
have
their
faces
uncovered
the
sociopath
who
has
become
bored
kills
all
three
of
us
and
eats
us
but
feels
no
guilt
because
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
morally
in
his
own
mind
in
support
for
the
first
assumption
the
christian
scriptures
say
this
evidence
deleted
im
not
going
to
accept
your
evidence
for
this
you
ask
us
to
accept
the
word
of
god
that
everything
good
comes
from
god
this
is
only
a
valid
argument
for
a
person
who
shares
your
beliefs
still
i
must
say
that
cataloging
the
major
themes
and
motifs
in
erotica
could
be
interesting
for
other
reasons
than
yours
so
good
luck
with
this
next
part
now
then
what
are
some
of
the
major
themesmotifs
in
the
pornographic
literature
on
places
like
altsexstories
these
are
some
that
ive
been
able
to
identify
please
addcomment
on
them
motif
the
malecinderella
in
so
many
of
the
stories
there
is
expressed
a
feeling
of
alienation
and
worthlessness
on
the
part
of
the
writer
or
otherwise
protagonist
of
the
story
with
regard
to
the
object
the
other
person
of
hisher
desire
often
a
story
involves
a
protagonist
who
on
the
surface
is
quite
average
but
underneath
usually
has
an
enormous
dick
who
desires
to
in
some
way
to
gain
access
in
a
definitely
sexual
way
to
the
other
person
who
heshe
confesses
is
far
more
desireable
than
heshe
is
and
who
indeed
seems
to
walk
between
the
raindrops
hmmmdo
i
detect
just
a
wee
bit
of
condescence
here
motif
a
celebration
of
indeed
preoccupation
with
beauty
not
very
objective
the
vast
majority
of
pornographic
literature
deals
with
beauty
be
it
innocence
somehow
about
to
be
lost
grace
or
simply
physical
beauty
and
generally
most
people
christian
or
non
will
say
that
beauty
is
good
one
could
construe
this
to
mean
that
beautiful
people
are
better
or
more
good
than
nonbeautiful
people
i
would
hope
that
people
relize
that
this
is
not
necessarily
true
motif
ones
dick
is
ones
instrument
of
redemption
might
i
suggest
the
word
penis
it
seems
more
in
line
with
the
tone
of
your
post
blessed
are
those
who
are
wellhung
for
they
shall
get
laid
from
what
would
thus
be
a
revised
matthew
bravo
i
respect
you
and
your
sense
of
humor
sir
motif
sex
as
an
expression
of
sincere
giving
there
is
often
enough
a
clear
desire
on
the
part
of
the
protagonist
to
give
definitely
sexual
pleasure
to
the
object
person
of
hisher
desires
yes
and
this
theme
is
usually
what
the
better
stories
are
about
however
they
are
not
always
selfish
i
could
point
to
examples
in
the
work
of
elf
sternberg
for
example
motif
altsexstories
describes
a
sex
which
is
completely
removed
from
the
realm
of
transmitting
life
so
removed
is
sex
from
its
procreative
dimension
on
altsexstories
that
one
begins
to
wonder
why
sex
even
involves
ejaculation
as
in
the
context
described
in
pornography
it
serves
then
no
real
purpose
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
it
does
in
pornographic
movies
it
affirms
the
virility
of
the
male
involved
as
well
as
assuring
the
reader
that
he
the
character
has
orgasmed
the
whole
picture
tm
is
probably
very
well
described
by
the
catholic
teaching
on
this
of
the
husband
and
wife
in
an
act
of
total
mutual
selfgiving
in
the
sexual
union
cooperating
with
god
in
opening
themselves
up
for
the
transmission
of
new
life
cf
humane
vitae
your
whole
picture
tm
unfortunately
only
applies
to
people
who
accept
your
church
in
addition
if
sex
is
for
procreation
then
why
did
god
make
it
pleasurable
so
that
people
would
want
to
do
it
rather
than
building
it
in
as
instinct
why
did
god
make
it
fallible
not
every
sexual
encounter
results
in
pregnancy
even
among
catholics
does
this
mean
that
they
have
sinned
in
any
case
altsexstories
and
the
catholic
teaching
will
probably
not
see
eye
to
eye
on
this
for
a
long
time
granted
motif
sex
used
as
an
instrument
violence
power
and
humiliation
why
pornography
seems
to
tend
in
that
direction
i
really
do
not
know
probably
volumes
could
be
written
on
the
relationships
between
sex
and
powerhumiliation
but
this
probably
gives
good
reason
why
traditionally
judeochristianity
has
been
so
negative
with
regard
to
sexuality
it
seems
to
tend
to
a
great
moral
morass
pornography
would
not
tend
in
those
directions
if
there
were
not
a
demand
for
it
many
people
have
violent
fantasies
that
they
would
never
act
out
in
real
life
but
will
think
about
and
read
about
and
mull
over
later

for
those
missing
the
context
of
this
thrilling
discussion
between
jim
and
i
jim
wrote
the
following
to
me
in
email
after
i
pointed
out
hate
to
shatter
your
self
image
of
perfection
that
you
appear
to
hold
but
your
language
is
wrong
jim
and
me
i
pointed
out
that
i
did
in
fact
agree
that
both
robert
weiss
and
jim
meritt
took
quotes
out
of
context
hence
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
jim
thinks
i
am
a
hypocrite
needless
to
say
i
dont
have
time
to
reply
to
every
article
on
trm
that
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
of
course
not
just
the
ones
you
disagree
with
qed
so
according
to
you
jim
the
only
way
to
criticize
one
person
for
taking
a
quote
out
of
context
without
being
a
hypocrite
is
to
post
a
response
to
every
person
on
trm
who
takes
a
quote
out
of
context
jim
replied
by
saying
did
i
either
ask
or
assert
that
but
today
we
find
four
articles
from
jim
one
of
which
has
the
subject
so
as
of
then
and
pointing
out
a
specific
instance
wrongo
again
is
it
not
the
case
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
when
someone
is
aware
of
something
and
has
the
capability
of
taking
action
and
does
not
that
individual
may
be
held
responsible
for
that
action
which
is
of
course
a
complete
red
herring
taking
quotes
out
of
context
isnt
a
crime
i
dont
have
time
to
read
every
article
on
trm
and
im
certainly
under
no
obligation
to
reply
to
them
all
so
check
the
newsgroups
does
silence
is
concurrence
imply
that
jim
thinks
that
because
i
didnt
respond
to
weiss
articles
i
must
condone
weiss
taking
quotes
out
of
context
jim
doesnt
want
to
give
a
direct
answer
to
this
question
read
what
he
has
written
and
decide
for
yourself
telepathy
again
you
claim
to
know
what
i
want
but
back
to
the
context
of
my
conversation
with
jim
jims
next
gambit
was
to
claim
that
he
was
using
inductive
logic
when
he
concluded
that
i
was
being
a
hypocrite
i
challenged
him
to
provide
the
details
of
that
logic
that
led
him
to
an
incorrect
conclusion
no
you
asked
specifically
what
was
wrong
with
yours
today
we
find
another
obscure
article
posting
it
twice
didnt
help
maybe
to
the
ignorant
i
accept
your
classification
more
red
herrings
could
jim
mean
that
he
has
read
an
uncountably
large
number
of
my
articles
do
you
know
what
uncountably
large
means
it
does
not
appear
so
could
jim
mean
that
because
i
axed
his
articles
but
not
weiss
articles
he
wants
to
conclude
inductively
well
i
cant
see
where
he
is
going
with
this
i
am
not
suprised
but
i
can
help
him
with
his
induction
ive
written
roughly
that
does
not
appear
to
be
the
case
the
appearance
of
your
argument
is
more
like
that
captain
kirk
would
have
gotten
from
mr
spock
written
by
a
stagehand
at
paramount
think
hard
about
this
jim
see
the
pattern
think
harder
run
it
through
your
induction
engine
and
see
what
pops
out
of
course
you
appear
arrogant

subject
re
christian
metaethics
in
article
mlspanixcom
michael
siemon
writes
well
the
whole
point
of
making
these
the
base
commandments
is
that
they
arent
reducible
to
rules
a
set
of
rules
is
a
moral
code
or
a
law
code
or
an
algorithm
for
acting
such
things
can
be
very
helpful
to
individuals
or
societies
but
not
if
they
are
used
instead
of
a
personal
involvement
in
and
responsibility
for
ones
actions
the
two
commandments
are
rules
they
are
merely
rules
that
are
so
vague
that
they
are
practically
devoid
of
meaning
michael
siemon
acknowledges
this
every
time
he
writes
that
the
resolution
of
an
argument
over
them
turns
on
secular
and
cultural
assumptions
that
are
independent
of
these
rules
the
great
commandment
is
more
than
anything
else
a
call
to
act
as
if
you
were
god
and
accepting
ultimate
responsibility
in
your
every
action
the
commandment
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
can
be
viewed
in
part
as
reminding
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
cannot
act
as
if
he
has
ultimate
responsibility
indeed
many
traditions
present
an
interpretation
where
believers
are
supposed
to
interpret
loving
ones
neighbor
as
following
various
other
rules
and
relying
on
their
god
to
make
things
come
out
right
precisely
because
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assume
such
ultimate
responsibility
once
again
we
are
confronted
with
good
sounding
goo
that
means
whatever
the
reader
wants
it
to
mean
conservatives
may
twist
this
act
as
if
you
were
god
to
mean
lay
down
rules
for
other
people
and
be
as
nasty
to
them
as
possible
if
they
dont
keep
your
rules
they
are
so
insistent
and
obvious
about
this
that
they
have
convinced
a
lot
of
people
who
rightly
reject
the
whole
concept
that
such
idiocy
is
how
god
acts
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
michael
cannot
refer
to
base
claims
or
base
commandments
to
show
that
such
readings
are
twisted
because
this
divergence
in
understanding
occurs
even
in
trying
to
interpret
the
base
claims
and
commandments
in
addressing
conservative
christians
michael
will
necessarily
draw
upon
secular
and
cultural
notions
that
these
conservative
christians
will
reject
but
why
should
anyone
be
looking
for
an
ethical
system
since
our
society
is
eager
to
hand
us
one
or
more
no
matter
what
we
do
it
may
be
that
we
need
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
in
which
case
i
will
profer
the
agapate
allelou
once
again
but
these
base
commandments
are
too
vague
to
serve
as
a
principle
for
the
critique
of
ethical
systems
the
meaning
of
these
base
commandments
for
any
believer
derives
from
the
secular
and
cultural
notions
that
the
believer
brings
to
them
from
how
the
believer
mixes
their
demands
with
straightforward
readings
of
other
biblical
passages
from
a
particular
sectarian
tradition
or
from
some
combination
of
these
things
these
commandments
lack
sufficient
substance
in
themself
to
serve
as
a
basis
for
criticizing
ethical
systems
what
meaning
they
have
comes
from
the
ethical
system
the
believer
brings
to
these
commandments
and
different
bodies
of
christians
have
from
the
beginning
urged
different
ethical
systems
or
in
some
cases
none
as
a
result
it
is
bizarre
to
identify
any
one
of
these
systems
however
popular
or
infamous
with
christianity
christianity
does
not
have
a
torah
it
does
not
have
a
quran
specifically
christian
scripture
has
very
little
if
anything
in
the
way
of
commandments
so
little
that
the
christians
who
desperately
want
commandments
go
mining
for
them
with
almost
no
support
the
one
single
thing
in
the
gospels
which
jesus
specifically
gives
as
a
commandment
to
us
is
love
one
another
jesus
explicitly
states
that
this
summarizes
jewish
law
which
would
seem
to
bring
in
all
of
it
if
we
properly
understand
what
it
means
to
love
god
and
love
our
neighbors
there
are
many
parables
and
teachings
the
gospels
attribute
to
jesus
that
are
straightforwardly
read
as
ethical
commandments
the
pauline
epistles
are
similarly
full
if
it
is
not
clear
that
these
all
come
together
in
a
sensible
understanding
of
ethical
behavior
the
problem
is
not
a
lack
of
raw
material
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the
gospel
seriously
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the
gospel
seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
tell
you
something
about
christianity
in
a
sense
the
wide
variety
of
interpretations
does
tell
us
something
about
christianity
it
tells
us
that
the
new
testament
authors
left
a
sufficiently
vague
hodgepodge
that
it
can
serve
as
the
source
text
for
many
vastly
different
beliefs
about
the
nature
of
the
christian
god
and
about
what
men
should
and
shouldnt
do
the
irony
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
christianity
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
cause
of
lesbians
and
gays
every
christian
principle
he
turns
to
this
cause
is
effective
only
through
the
extrachristian
principles
through
which
michael
interprets
his
religion
and
the
homophobes
apply
the
same
christian
principles
with
equal
justification
to
their
cause
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
michael
paints
a
picture
of
standard
american
atheism
as
the
rejection
of
the
evil
in
many
conservative
christian
interpretations
of
the
bible
but
i
think
it
is
even
more
damaging
to
christianity
to
note
that
the
new
testament
presents
such
a
vague
hodgepodge
of
notions
about
the
nature
of
god
and
the
nature
of
the
good
except
of
course
when
it
is
ordered
by
an
interpretation
that
relies
on
extraneous
principles
here
i
think
we
should
apply
a
christian
parable
where
a
cold
drink
can
have
its
value
and
a
hot
drink
can
have
its
value
but

lukewarm

should

satan
here
is
someones
biblical
claim
for
the
characteristics
of
satan
this
is
probably
the
portion
of
scripture
that
you
were
talking
about
isaiah
this
does
speak
of
the
morning
star
which
according
to
you
is
the
babylonian
prince
ok
so
i
turn
your
attention
to
daniel
this
passage
concerns
a
revelation
of
prophecy
to
daniel
by
the
messenger
from
god
within
this
passage
the
messenger
from
god
speaks
of
how
he
fought
for
weeks
against
the
prince
of
the
persian
kingdom
obviously
this
prince
was
not
an
earthly
prince
this
prince
of
the
persian
kingdom
is
probably
one
of
the
demons
in
satans
hierarchy
as
such
the
morning
star
can
be
the
prince
of
babylon
w
ho
can
also
be
satan
another
passage
concerning
satans
fall
from
heaven
is
ezekiel
and
separately
devil
chose
to
try
to
become
greater
than
god
he
wanted
to
sit
on
gods
throne
when
the
devil
was
created
he
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
angels
in
heaven
we
have
here
three
distinct
claims
concerning
the
results
of
the
devils
decision
making
a
specific
desire
and
a
physical
description
now
in
support
aside
from
the
minor
detail
that
an
author
seldom
writes
an
unbiased
account
of
the
opposition
we
see
isaiah
isa
how
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
o
lucifer
son
of
the
morning
how
art
thou
cut
down
to
the
ground
which
didst
weaken
the
nations
isa
for
thou
hast
said
in
thine
heart
i
will
ascend
into

i
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
god
i
will
sit
also
upon
the
mount
of

in

sides
of
the
north
isa
i
will
ascend
above
the
heights
of

i
will
be

yet
thou

and
we
all
know
what
that

i
had
an

interesting
experience
with
the
rosicrucians
or
at

rosicrucians
of
some
sort
last
sunday
they
had
advertised
that
they
were
holding
a
lecture
titled
the

of
the

the

of

which
rhymes

out

i
went

there
were
four
people
there
apart

one
woman
and
two
men
apart
from

the
rosicrucians
were

both

one

told

about

read

thirteenth
century
the
other
guy
took
over
reading
from
his
piece
of
paper
in
a
fairytale
tellers
voice
what
he
said
sounded
like
a
load
of
crap
to
me
of
course
that
might
be
because
i
am
unenlightened
or
something
what
made
me
a
bit
suspicious
was
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contained
something
divine
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divinity
then
that
we
couldnt
become
divine
as
the
persons
we
are
currently
but
if
we
worked
really
hard
we
would
reach
eternal
bliss
maybe
ive
read
too
much
raw
but
it
sounded
very
much
like
the
things
he
talks
about
in
the
chapter
how
to
robotize
people
and
brainwash
your
friends
in
prometheus
rising
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
the
two
rosicrucians
the
one
holding
the
actual
lecture
obviously
was
top
dog
and
the
other
one
seemed
to
be
a
true
believer
i
got
the
impression
that
the
top
dog
had
more
distance
to
the
faith
than
the
true
believer
that
he
used
it
to
gain
power
and
admiration
he
spoke
like
a
fairytale
teller

he

subject
re
christian
metaethics
i
wrote
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
in
article
dave
davis
writes
this
requires
the
assumption
that
all
interpretations
are
equally
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reasonably
distinguishing
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumption
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
no
it
follows
from
the
fact
that
most
christians
choice
of
interpretation
stems
from
a
mix
of
beliefs
that
are
influenced
by
the
secular
ethics
of
their
culture
and
that
are
not
fully
determined
by
scripture
whether
or
not
there
is
some
right
interpretation
matters
not
few
christians
claim
the
ability
to
read
the
mind
of
their
god
dave
davis
should
note
that
it
was
michael
who
first
stated
the
importance
of
secular
and
cultural
influence
in
this
thread
i
think
michael
is
right
in
this
but
regardless
it
should
be
noted
that
this
has
not
been
a
point
of
contention
between
michael
and
myself
i
have
argued
beyond
michaels
claims
that
the
christian
scriptures
are
open
to
so
many
interpretations
including
a
wide
divergence
within
the
christian
tradition
that
even
their
most
important
themes
are
vague
again
it
does
not
matter
that
there
is
some
right
interpretation
unless
there
is
a
way
to
determine
what
that
right
interpretation
is
it
is
the
lack
of
an
objective
measure
not
the
presumed
lack
of
an
answer
that
puts
the
force
behind
the
line
i
argue
michael
and
i
and
others
read
the
bible
with
christian
glasses
among
the
things
that
this
should
imply
is
that
the
nt
informs
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
dominanting
it
some
points
in
the
ot
ceremonial
dietary
laws
are
explicitly
abrogated
by
the
nt
texts
there
are
enough
christian
glasses
varying
over
a
sufficiently
broad
range
of
color
that
i
can
find
a
few
that
support
my
example
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the
gospel
seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the
gospel
russell
turpins
no
here
is
misplaced
not
to
say
inappropriate
michaels
selfdescription
must
govern
the
equation
of
radical
liberal
which
seems
implied
by
russell
turpin
is
wrong
in
my
opinion
what
makes
michael
radical
is
that
he
fully
acknowledges
that
christian
scripture
and
tradition
fail
to
determine
the
doctrines
that
so
many
branches
within
christianity
hold
dear
he
is
willing
to
live
and
practice
his
religion
within
this
indeterminacy
and
he
is
willing
to
acknowledge
that
much
of
his
understanding
of
things
christian
is
influenced
by
ideas
that
are
not
purely
christian
those
christians
i
have
called
conservative
must
also
interpret
but
they
do
not
recognize
or
at
least
are
unwilling
to
admit
the
extent
and
importance
of
this
russell
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michaels
theological
positions
actually
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christianity
dean
simeon
responds
this
time
gently
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhaps
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibly
mean
the
implied
rhetorical
effort
to
separate
michael
from
the
tradition
is
a
failure
michael
is
in
the
tradition
if
your
idea
of
the
tradition
doesnt
include
him
change
your
idea
of
the
tradition
i
recognize
that
michael
is
part
of
the
tradition
but
what
does
it
tell
one
about
a
tradition
covering
origen
aquinas
jerry
fallwell
and
jesse
jackson
that
it
also
includes
michael
siemon
not
very
much
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
this
conclusion
does
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goes
before
a
surprising
logical
ellipsis
i
think
the
conclusion
does
follow
the
purely
christian
principles
that
michael
has
are
the
ones
he
shares
with
others
in
the
christian
tradition
or
that
can
be
derived
from
christian
scripture
these
necessarily
vague
are
not
enough
to
drive
his
political
stances
that
one
should
love
ones
neighbor
is
a
purely
christian
principle
that
this
means
showing
tolerance
for
homosexuality
is
not
as
to
these
political
stances
they
are
often
at
odds
with
what
is
commonly
held
in
most
of
current
christendom
and
so
i
suspect
they
could
be
better
pressed
outside
it
on
the
other
hand
i
can
well
understand
the
counterpoint
that
these
political
stances
become
most
influential
when
presented
to
those
who
need
them
most
this
is
a
theological
statement
worthy
of

turpin

had

from

the

were

existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that

is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of

and
therefore
immediately

remember
these

were
written
for

applied
only
to

jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we

sin

there

salvation

sorry

how
do
you
reconcile
a

with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at

was

admission
on

made
a

now
that

does
this
mean
that
for

god
now
damns
us
to
eternal

after

tis
someone
just
told
me
that
the
old
testament
books
were
translated
into
greek
a
long
time
ago
yes
thats
a
famous
version
called
the
septuagint
it
was
a
translation
made
by
greek
jews
and
that
the
originals
were
destroyed
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
no
i
dont
know
what
youre
referring
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
temple
was
destroyed
some
manuscripts
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscripts
are
as
good
as
our
greek
ones
i
dont
know
about
any
originals
the
person
who
was
telling
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greeks
had
a
wonderful
library
in
alexandria
that
was
full
of
manuscriptsscrolls
and
that
it
was
burned
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
was
translated
perhaps
to
conceal
some
changes
in
the
different
versions
or
perhaps
just
as
part
of
the
typical
burning
of
valuable
things
that
occurs
during
changes
in
power
groups
hei
dunno
no
the
library
at
alexandria
was
perhaps
the
greatest
library
ever
built
in
the
world
the
greeks
had
a
love
of
wisdom
philo
sophos
and
this
great
love
was
reflected
in
the
alexandrian
library
the
christians
got
a
hold
of
it
and
began
modifying
and
purging
texts
and
then
the
moslems
invaded
and
either
the
christians
burned
the
library
to
keep
it
from
falling
into
moslems
hands
far
more
likely
since
they
were
the
book
burners
not
the
moslems
or
it
burned
in
the
sack
of
the
city
or
the
moslems
burned
it
either
way
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
was
lost
the
destruction
of
the
library
of
alexandria
was
probably
one
of
the
greatest
crimes
of
man
against
man
so
i
was
just
wondering
since
i
imagine
some
jewish
people
somewhere
must
have
had
copies
of
the
earlier
hebrew
versions
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
very
different
from
the
greek
derived
version
no
there
are
a
few
famous
discrepancies
isaiahs
prophecy
about
a
young
woman
was
changed
into
a
virgin
which
was
how
the
new
testament
writers
read
it
but
not
many
actually
the
hebrew
almah
young
woman
was
translated
as
the
hellenistic
greek
parthenos
which
may
or
may
not
be
correctly
translated
into
the
modern
and
technical
english
term
virgin
the
jews
did
not
have
the
type
of
virginity
cult
that
the
grecoromans
had
in
artemis
and
diana
well
perhaps
this
is
the
answer
then
deleted
if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstore
youll
get
a
bible
translated
by
jews
so
there
will
be
some
differences
in
interpretation
but
the
text
theyre
translating
from
is
basically
the
same
the
standard
text
used
by
christians
and
jews
is
the
masoretic
text
jews
of
course
use
the
text
in
its
original
hebrew
without
translation
if
you
want
to
read
the
original
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bible
that
contains
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translation
written
underneath
each
word
if
you

you

kent
sandvik
responds
hmm
it
seems
that
this
is
the
core
of
christianity
then
you
have
to
feel
guilty
i
think
i
see
where
you
are
coming
from
kent
jesus
doesnt
view
guilt
like
our
modern
venacular
colors
it
feelings
have
nothing
to
do
with
guilt
feelings
arise
from
the
state
of
being
guilty
feeling
and
guilt
are
mutally
exclusive
feelings
are
a
reaction
from
guilt
jesus
is
talking
about
the
guilt
state
not
the
reaction
let
me
give
you
an
example
have
you
ever
made
a
mistake
have
you
ever
lied
to
someone
even
a
little
white
lie
have
you
ever
claimed
to
know
something
that
you
really
didnt
know
have
you
ever
hated
someone
have
you
ever
been
selfish
are
you
guilty
of
any
one
of
these
the
answer
is
of
course
yes
you
are
guilty
period
that
is
it
what
jesus
is
getting
at
no
big
surprise
feelings
do
not
even
enter
the
picture
consider
jesuss
use
of
the
word
guilt
as
how
a
court
uses
it
jesus
is
concerned
that
everyone
should
admit
that
they
are
guilty
of
being
imperfect
the
bible
calls
it
the
state
that
we
are
all
sinners
we
all
do
bad
things
even
the
most
insignficant
thing
that
we
do
wrong
is
proof
of
our
guilt
that
we
are
all
sinners
it
is
it
in
our
nature
to
do
bad
things
we
are
sinners
therefore
we
do
bad
things
being
a
sinner
is
fact
it
is
not
a
pleasant
fact
but
it
is
just
a
fact
we
are
not
perfect
calling
us
sinners
should
have
no
more
emotional
charge
to
you
than
calling
you
a
human
being
guilty
as
charged
and
then
theres
this
single
personality
that
will
save
you
from
this
universal
guilt
feeling
you
can
handle
your
guilt
in
one
of
two
ways
acknowledge
you
made
a
mistake
learn
from
it
and
try
to
not
do
it
againin
the
meantime
not
punishing
yourself
for
it
which
is
the
way
jesus
wants
you
to
handle
or
it
this
is
the
healthy
way
or
two
the
destructive
way
put
yourself
down
slap
yourself
and
feel
like
crap
never
forgive
yourself
force
yourself
to
say
a
thousand
hail
marys
even
to
suicide
this
the
way
jesus
does
not
want
us
to
deal
with
it
all
people
fall
into
this
category
to
some
extent
in
their
lives
jesus
is
not
in
the
business
of
saving
us
from
this
guilt
feeling
jesus
is
in
the
business
of
showing
us
how
much
he
loves
us
despite
our
guilt
jesus
knows
we
are
guilty
that
isnt
new
to
him
it
is
no
big
deal
to
him
he
just
wants
you
to
realize
that
this
sinful
nature
destroys
the
relationship
between
you
and
him
that
is
what
he
wants
you
to
know
why
because
he
wants
to
have
your
company
you
are
immensely
valuable
to
him
jesus
wants
a
relationship
with
you
however
in
our
present
sinful
nature
we
are
incapable
of
having
this
relationship
god
is
perfect
we
are
not
you
cannot
fit
a
square
peg
into
a
round
hole
however
god
has
provided
a
way
for
us
to
change
our
nature
so
that
we
can
have
a
relationship
with
him
god
has
provided
jesus
so
that
whosoever
just
believes
in
jesus
will
have
their
nature
changed
the
holy
spirit
will
move
it
and
now
divine
nature
is
now
within
lives
our
very
beingand
us
and
god
communicate
with
each
through
his
unifying
holy
spirit
the
benefits
of
this
are
endless
for
with
the
divine
nature
living
within
us
we
can
now
see
our
imperfections
better
we
can
now
head
them
off
at
the
pass
with
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
living
in
us
we
now
have
his
power
to
help
us
overcome
our
shortcomings
because
the
divine
nature
lives
within
us
we
can
now
understand
profound
bible
passages
that
never
before
we
could
understand
because
the
divine
nature
now
lives
within
us
we
now
have
authority
over
demonic
forces
and
lastly
because
the
divine
nature
now
lives
within
us
we
have
eternal
lifefor
the
holy
spirit
is
eternal
the
relationship
with
jesus
is
of
the
utmost
importance
because
it
is
not
what
you
do
in
life
that
qualifies
you
to
belong
to
heavenly
kingdom
it
is
your
relationship
to
the
living
god
remember
what
jesus
said
at
the
tail
end
of
matthew
when
he
separated
the
goats
from
the
sheep
many
people
in
the
last
day
will
ask
him
didnt
i
prophesy
in
your
name
and
do
miracles
and
do
good
things
in
your
name
and
what
did
jesus
say
depart
from
me
for
i
never
knew
you
that
is
the
cornerstone
of
christianity
kent
jesus
must
know
you
as
his
friend
it
is
your
relationship
to
jesus
if
he
is
your
friend
and
you
are
his
you
will
be
counted
among
those
who
will
share
in
his
inheritance
in
heaven
brian
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
dont
feel
guilty
at
all
i
do
mistakes
and
i
regret
them
however
ive
never
had
this
huge
guilt
feeling
hanging
over
my
shoulder
good
it
shows
that
you
have
a
strong
selfimagethat
you
love
yourself
that
is
the
second
greatest
commandment
jesus
taught
if
only
more
people
could
do
as
you
do
as
i
said
before
in
the
common
english
venacular
feeling
guilty
has
a
different
meaning
than
the
state
of
guilt
this
all
is
a
very
clear
indication
that
you
need
a
certain
personality
type
in
order
to
believe
and
adjust
to
certain
religious
doctrines
and
if
your
personality
type
is
opposite
then
you
are
not
that
easily
attached
to
a
certain
world
view
system
i
believe
what
we
all
need
in
our
personalities
is
a
lot
less
ego
a
lot
less
selfcenteredness
and
a
lot
more
unconditional
love
there
are
humans
that
subscribe
to
the
same
notion
the
nice
thing
is
that
when
you
finally
shake
off
this
huge
burden
the
shoulders
feel
far
more
relaxed
yes
you
have
stated
what
jesus
said
remember
come
to
me
take
my
yoke
upon
your
shoulders
for
my
burden
is
light
a
yoke
is
used
to
direct
oxen
to
do
work
once
you
have
a
relationship
with
jesus
you
and
him
share
the
yoke
and
the
burdens
of
life
having
god
at
your
side
is
of
great
advantage

objectivity
was
after
years
this
discussion
on
objective
seems
to
be
falling
into
solipsism
eg
the
recent
challenge
from
frank
dwyer
for
someone
to
prove
that
he
can
actually
observe
phenomena
someones
even
made
the
statement
that
science
is
subjective
and
that
even
atom
are
subjective
this
is
getting
a
bit
silly
and
the
word
objective
is
losing
all
meaning
lets
start
by
remembering
the
definition
of
objective
which
has
been
already
presented
objective
adj
of
or
having
to
do
with
a
material
object
as
distinguished
from
a
mental
concept
having
actual
existence
unenfluenced
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
b
based
on
observable
phenomenon
the
objectivity
of
a
thing
is
not
based
on
whether
everyone
agrees
on
that
thing
eg
the
world
is
objectively
round
regardless
of
the
fact
that
there
exist
flat
earthers
but
rather
whether
it
is
based
observable
and
verifiable
phenomenon
instead
of
being
based
solely
on
peoples
wishes
feeling
mental
processes
etc
thus
atoms
being
based
on
very
observable
and
repeatable
phenomenon
are
indeed
considered
to
be
objective
rather
than
subjective
even
weird
high
energy
physics
is
based
on
observable
phenomenon
even
though
that
observation
can
change
the
outcome
nor
are
those
observable
phenomenon
affected
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
eg
chemical
reactions
do
not
change
to
the
whims
of
different
people
thus
to
say
that
science
is
not
objective
ie
objectively
verifiable
is
a
bit
silly
as
that
is
the
point
of
science
now
i
will
agree
that
science
is
not
objectively
good
i
will
not
thereby
conclude
though
that
science
is
not
objective
now
some
examples
things
which
are
objective
a
tractor
is
larger
than
the
average
breadbox
chlorophyll
is
green
seawater
contains
salt
there
exists
ozone
in
the
atmosphere
at
least
presently
ozone
blocks
ultraviolet
light
ultraviolet
light
increases
the
incidents
of
skin
cancer
good
on
the
other
hand
is
a
value
judgement
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
an
existence
apart
from
what
we
give
it
unless
someone
can
objectively
show
the
existence
of
an
omnipotent
entity
which
has
defined
good
we
cannot
quantify
it
touch
it
or
collect
it
in
any
concrete
sense
eg
i
have
a
bag
full
of
good
now
we
do
sometimes
attempt
to
give
the
word
good
an
objective
meaning
eg
good
has
been
used
to
denote
strength
resiliency
speed
etc
that
though
is
a
subjective
definition
as
some
might
not
see
strength
and
etc
as
necessarily
good
eg
strength
inspired
by
naziism
is
not
generally
viewed
as
good
as
to
a
morality
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
morality
strictly
based
on
verifiable
observable
phenomenon
the
closest
i
have
seen
is
some
form
of
the
golden
rule
which
concludes
that
it
is
best
not
to
deliberately
piss
people
off
as
they
will
likely
then
involve
themselves
in
your
life
in
a
manner
you
wont
like
this
is
verifiable
when
you
get
in
someones
face
they
will
often
retaliate
another
objective
fact
about
morality
is
that
a
more
powerful
group
can
enforce
their
morality
on
a
weaker
group
and
thus
can
at
times
ignore
that
form
of
the
golden
rule
without
fear
of
reprisal
now
as
to
whether
this
enforcing
of
morality
is
good
or
bad
is
quite
subjective
by
the
way
remember
that
subjective
does
not
mean
that
a
thing
cannot
be
formally
stated
or
even
commonly
agreed
upon
it
only
means
that
that
it
is
not
verifiable
from
observable
phenomena
or
has
a
physical
existence
unto
itself
also
note
that
i
have
not
stated
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
objective
morality
or
that
i
could
not
accept
any
such
a
morality
i
have
simply
stated
that
i
have
seen
no
evidence
of
any
such
morality
one
other
thing
to
notice
objective
is
many
times
used
as
synonymous
with
true
andor
absolute
and
subjective
sometimes
has
the
connotation
of
false
andor
relative
taint
necessarily
so
for
instance
when
a
conclusion
is
based
on
objective
but
insufficient
evidence
then
it
can
be
both
objective
and
false
as
to
absolute
it
is
easy
to
note
that
while
we
can
objectively
show
that
tnt
is
explosive
but
that
does
not
absolutely
mean
that
all
tnt
will
explode
and
thus
objective
is
not
necessarily
absolute
either
on
the
other
hand
something
subjective
can
also
be
either
absolutist
or
true
for
instance
there
are
some
theists
who
are
specifically
absolutist
in
their
morality
even
though
they
have
only
subjective
evidence
to
back
it
up
further
many
a
scientist
and
detective
has
been
motivated
by
subjective
reasons
eg
a
gut
feeling
or
hunch
to
investigate
a
phenomena
or
situation
and
gather
the
objective
evidence
necessary
to
support
a
true
hypothesis
on
the
whole
though
i
would
have
to
agree
that
objective
evidence
is
much
more
trustworthy
than
subjective
evidence

let

one
i
got
a
really
bad
feeling
in
my

back
when
i
was
a
christian
i
couldnt
really
pinpoint
it
but
something
felt
dreadfully
cheap

wrong
about
the
whole
affair
i
had
been
a
devout
follower
even
a
biblebanger
but
eventually
it
started
ringing
terribly
hollow
to
me
and
i
felt
torn
when
i
began
to
disagree
with
a
lot
of
what
the
bible
and
my
priests
told
me
this
was
what
made
me
finally
realize
that
either
i
was
very
wrong
or
else
the
bible
was
very
wrong
and
since
i
felt
reasonably
sure
of
myself
i
decided
to
start
analyzing
the

very
closely
that
was
the
catalyst
to
my
break
with
my

it
was

brian
have
you
checked

what
your

told
you
in

to
see
whether
they
were
telling

the

did
you
know

according

there
shouldnt
even

do
you

devised

commands
will
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteousness
surpasses
that
of
the
pharisees
and
the
teachers
of
the
law
you
will
certainly
not
enter
the
kingdom

mt
niv
in
pretty
red
letters
so
that
you
know
its
jesus
talking
this
causes
a
serious
dilemma
for
christians
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
apply
to
them
i
think
thats
why
paul
harvey
likes
quoting
it
so
much
rob
lanphier
i
will
clarify
my
earlier
quote
gods
laws
were
originally
written
for
the
israelites
jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace
of
god
i
never
said
that
the
law
was
made
obsolete
by
jesus
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
if
youll
notice
he
also
reams
into
the
pharisees
for
mucking
up
the
law
with
their
own
contrived
interpretations
they
knew
every
letter
of
the
law
and
followed
it
with
their
heads
but
not
their
hearts
that
is
why
he
points
out
that
our
righteousness
must
surpass
that
of
the
pharisees
in
order
to
be
accepted
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
people
such
as
the
pharisees
are
those
who
really
go
out
of
their
way
to
debate
about
the
number
of
angels
that
can
dance
on
the
head
of
a
pin
they
had
become
legalistic
rulemakers
religious
lawyers
who
practiced
the
letter
of
the
law
but
never
really
believed
in
it
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too

i

a

would
point

the

though
and
have
no
such
excuse
first
seal
in
revelation
the
entirety
of
psalms
and
the
most
of
revelation
which
demonstrated
one
of
his
major
points
about
how
the
writings
in
the
prophets
including
david
and
in
the
psalms
and
in
revelation
are
all
telling
the
same
story
when
you
understand
how
theyre
related
ie
have
the
key
they
largely
explain
each
other
charles
manson
used
revelation
as
well
do
we
see
a
pattern
here
i
wonder
if
koresh
liked
the
beatles
you
missed
the
point
which
is
that
the
prophets
the
psalms
and
revelation
all
together
provide
a
very
rich
view
of
a
very
special
event
a
wedding
koresh
was
a
nut
okay
just
because
he
found
ways
for
the
bible
to
backup
his
rantings
does
not
make
him
any
less
of
a
kook
how
are
you
able
to
make
such
a
conclusion
please
note
that
the
first
part
of
revelation
makes
it
clear
that
the
address
is
to
those
in
the
church
that
said
it
doesnt
hurt
to
try
to
see
what
the
prophecies
are
ahead
of
time
for
those
outside
the
church
seems
to
me
koresh
is
yet
another
messenger
that
got
killed
for
the
message
he
carried
ill
type
this
very
slowly
so
that
you
can
understand
he
either
set
the
fire
himself
or
told
his
followers
to
do
so
dont
make
him
out
to
be
a
martyr
he
did
not
get
killed
he
killed
himself
so
you
say
it
should
be
interesting
to
see
what
the
investigators
conclude
and
what
the
final
judgments
are
in
the
mean
time
we
sure
learned
a
lot
about
evil
and
corruption
are
you
surprised
things
have
gotten
that
rotten
the
evil
was
inside
the
compound
all
that
thou
shalt
not
kill
stuff
so
much
for
war
and
government
eh
oh
yeah
one
last
point
for
the
believers
philippian
for
the
rest
of
us
could
you
please
post
the
text
very
glad
you
asked
since
i
goofed
it
should
be
philippian
here
from
niv
because
of
my
chains
most
of
the
brothers
in
the
lord
have
been
encouraged
to
speak
the
word
of
god
more
courageously
and
fearlessly
it
is
true
that
some
preach
christ
out
of
envy
and
rivalry
but
others
out
of
good
will
the
latter
do
so
in
love
knowing
that
i
am
put
here
for
the
gospel
the
former
preach
christ
out
of
selfish
ambition
not
sincerely
supposing
that
they
can
stir
up
trouble
for
me
while
i
am
chains
but
what
does
it
matter
the
important
thing
is
that
in
every
way
whether
from
false
motives
or
true
christ
is
preached
and
because
of
this
i
rejoice
my
comment
stems
from
the
realization
that
we
who
love
the
lord
are
human
and
imperfect
whatever
we
preach
no
matter
how
eloquent
or
how
corrupted
is
of
little
difference
those
who
know
the
masters
voice
will
recognize
him
a
gemstone
amidst
rock
such
is
also
the
lesson
of
the
stumblingblock

those
who

one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
the
fire
was
started
when
one
of
the
tanks
spraying
the
tear
gas
into
the
facilities
knocked
over
a
lantern
in
two
places
at
once
bit
of
a
coincidence
that
never
lived
out
in
the
country
i
see
years
ago
i
had
a
place
where
i
had
to
carry
in
propane
every
month
hook
the
bottle
up
to
copper
line
to
supply
both
the
stove
and
a
type
of
water
heater
called
a
flashheater
a
flash
heater
has
a
pilot
lamp
heres
the
point
if
the
davidians
had
their
propane
tanks
hooked
up
to
copper
or
some
such
lines
run
through
the
ceiling
spaces
when
the
fbi
started
wrecking
the
place
they
could
easily
have
ruptured
the
lines
which
then
would
start
spreading
out
through
the
overhead
and
since
it
was
a
country
home
it
wasnt
necessarily
built
with
nonflamable
insulation
its
probably
more
plausible
than
anything
else
that
the
fire
started
mainly
as
a
result
of
accident
or
willful
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
fbi
which
should
have
known
better
ie
manslaughter
its
certain
that
if
the
tanks
hadnt
been
used
that
day
the
fire
wouldnt
have
started
whatever
the
faults
the

had

so
what
is
your
beef
against
jesus
first
and
foremost
i
honestly
do
not
believe
that
jesus
was
anything
more
than
a
man
who
lived
and
died
two
thousand
years
ago
i
know
your
bible
provides
wonderful
stories
of
the
things
he
said
and
did
but
i
simply
do
not
believe
that
he
still
exists
as
an
entity
that
has
any
bearing
on
this
universe
or
the
lives
in
it
and
i
similarly
do
not
believe
that
the
god
that
you
worship
exists
or
has
ever
existed
period
i
view
religion
in
general
and
christianity
in
specific
as
a
cultural
virus
that
has
been
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation
because
people
are
often
too
afraid
to
think
for
themselves
and
claim
responsibility
for
their
own
fate
so
they
brainwash
themselves
and
their
children
into
believing
the
popular
myths
and
it
goes
on
from
there
and
eventually
christianity
becomes
a
given
if
so
many
other
people
believe
in
it
it
must
be
right
no
i
dont
believe
in
any
life
after
death
i
believe
that
when
i
die
i
die
so
therefore
its
up
to
me
to
try
to
bring
meaning
and
purpose
to
my
life
in
the
meantime
i
dont
believe
that
its
a
good
thing
to
humble
myself
and
view
pride
as
a
sin
pride
in
moderation
is
a
constructive
thing
i
see
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
homosexuality
and
nothing
inferior
about
women
and
my
priests
lost
a
lot
of
my
trust
when
they
patronizingly
tried
to
explain
the
faults
of
these
opinions
to
me
i
dont
believe
in
loving
everyone
especially
people
ive
never
met
while
i
try
to
show
respect
to
everyone
my
love
and
admiration
is
something
not
easily
earned
and
i
do
not
feel
guilty
about
denying
my
respect

to

who
has
abused
it

you
want
me

if

if

i
would
take

another
reason

the

i

no
the

he
then
stated

two

were
enough
for
the

to
carry
to
be
counted
as
lawless
so
having
more
than

number
of
weapons
was

really

hes

okay

id

not
he
was
clearly
a
liar
he
said

broadcast
his
message
but
he
didnt
then
he
said
he
would
surrender
after
passover
but
he
didnt
the
rest
of
the
story
seems
to
be
that
the
agreement
for
the
broadcast
was
for
primetime
and
that
koresh
never
even
heard
it
played
wasnt
even
tuned
in
to
the
radio
when
it
aired
so
no
reason
to
come
out
if
later

had

a

grossly
twisted

im
certain
koresh
would
think
he
was
at

evil
itself

to
coming

wasnt
that

tis
someone
just
told

that
the
old
testament
books
were
translated
into
greek
a
long
time
ago
yes
thats
a
famous
version
called
the
septuagint
it
was
a
translation
made
by
greek
jews
and
that
the
originals
were
destroyed
in
a
fire
soon
afterward
i
dont
know
what
youre
referring
to
here
when
the
jersusalem
temple
was
destroyed
some
manuscripts
may
have
been
lost
but
i
think
our
extant
hebrew
manuscripts
are
as
good
as
our
greek
ones
i
dont
know
about
any
originals
the
person
who
was
telling
me
about
the
septuagint
version
said
that
the
greeks
had
a
wonderful
library
in
alexandria
that
was
full
of
manuscriptsscrolls
and
that
it
was
burned
soon
after
the
septuagint
version
was
translated
perhaps
to
conceal
some
changes
in
the
different
versions
or
perhaps
just
as
part
of
the
typical
burning
of
valuable
things
that
occurs
during
changes
in
power
groups
hei
dunno
so
i
was
just
wondering
since
i
imagine
some
jewish
people
somewhere
must
have
had
copies
of
the
earlier
hebrew
versions
is
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
very
different
from
the
greek
derived
version
no
there
are
a
few
famous
discrepancies
isaiahs
prophecy
about
a
young
woman
was
changed
into
a
virgin
which
was
how
the
new
testament
writers
read
it
but
not
many
well
perhaps
this
is
the
answer
then
deleted
if
you
go
to
a
jewish
bookstore
youll
get
a
bible
translated
by
jews
so
there
will
be
some
differences
in
interpretation
but
the
text
theyre
translating
from
is
basically
the
same
if
you
want
to
read
the
original
you
can
buy
an
interlinear
bible
that
contains
the
hebrew
old
testament
and
the
greek
new
testament
with
an
english
translation
written
underneath
each
word
if
you
want
a

with
a
possiblymoreoriginal
basic

you
can
try

good

ive

the

you
hate
your
whom
you
can
see
then
how
can
you
love
god
whom
you
cannot
see
what
does
this
belief
entail
believing
in
christ
and
having
your
sins
forgiven
in
his
name
does
not
give
a
christian
a
free
licence
to
sin
to
repent
of
a
sin
is
to
ask
forgiveness
of
that
sin
and
try
not
to
do
it
again
i
am
a
christian
but
if
you
lump
me
in
with
racists
and
accuse
me
of
being
such
then
are
you
not
prejudging
me
btw
i
am
of
chinese
racial
background
and
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
part
of
a
visible
minority
in
this
country
i
dont
think
that
i
would
be
favourably
looked
upon
by
these
white
supremist
christians
as
you
call
them
anyone
can
say
what
they
believe
but
if
they
dont
practice
what
they
preach
then
their
belief
is
false
do
you
concur
now
for
your
original
statement
what
bothers
me
most
is
why
people
who
have
no
religious
affiliation
continue
to
persecute
jews
why
this
hatred
of
jews
the
majority
of
people
who
persecute
jews
are
not
christians
i
cant
speak
for
all
christians
and
there
are
bound
to
be
a
few
who
are
on
the
antisemitism
bandwagon
you
imply
here
that
it
is
predominately
atheists
and
agnostics
who
persecute
jews
i
am
hard
pressed
to
think
of
even
an
example
of
jewish
persecution
in
the
hands
of
atheistsagnostics
nazis
and
racists
in
general
are
the
ones
that
come
to
my
immediate
attention
what
i
believe
is
that
such
people
may
be
using
the
bible
to
mask
their
racial
intolerance
and
bigotry
they
can
do
as
they
do
and
hide
behind
christianity
but
i
tell
you
that
jesus
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
about
the
only
one
that
comes
to
mind
would
be
in
the
former
soviet
union
where
many
religious
people
suffered
some
sort
of
persecution
not
to
mention
many
atheistagnostics
who
suffered
persecution
for
believing
the
government
sucked
no
arguement
there
rob
lanphier
the
only
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
those
who
call
themselves
christian
may
not
be
christian
i
ask
that
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
by
what
they
do
and
what
they
say
if
they
are
not
modelled
after
the
example
of
jesus
christ
then
they
are
not
christian
if
they
have
not
repented
of
their
sins
and
accepted
jesus
christ
as
their
personal
lord
and
saviour
then
they
are
not
christian
these
are
the
only
criteria
to
being
a
christian
may
god
be

you

are

of

had

in

he
saw
no
indication
that

were

claim
it
was
not
a
suecide
its
not
clear
that
more
than
one
of
the
survivors
made
this
claim
it
is
clear
that
at
least
one
of
the
survivors
made
the
contradictory
claim
that
bd
members
had
started
the
fire
no
this
is
far
from
clear
we
only
have
the
word
of
the
fbi
spokepeople
that
a
survivor
made
this
claim
we
have
the
contradictory
word
of
the
lawyers
who
spoke
with
the
survivors
individually
that
all
of
them
agreed
that
they
did
not
have
a
suicide
pact
and
did
not
intentionally
start
the
fire
in
the
absense
of
any
more
evidence
i
dont
see
how
we
can
decide
who
to
believe
furthermore
its
quite
possible
that
there
was
no
general
suicide
pact
and
that
some
small
inner
circle
took
it
upon
themselves
to
kill
everyone
else
with
the
state
of
the
area
now
we
may
never
know
what
happened
bds
were
not
contemplating
suecide
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
they
committed
one
no
reason
how
about
these
two
some
of
the
survivors
claimed
that
bd
members
poured
fuel
along
the
corridors
and
set
fire
to
it
the
speed
at
which
the
fire
spread
is
not
inconsistent
with
this
claim
again
we
have
only
the
word
of
the
fbi
on
this
claim
the
lawyers
who
have
also
talked
to
the
survors
deny
that
any
of
them
are
making
that
claim
there
was
certainly
a
fire
which
killed
most
of
the
people
in
the
compound
there
is
a
very
very
good
possibility
that
the
fbi
did
not
start
this
fire
this
is
a
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
bds
did
i
will
agree
on
your
assessment
as
to
the
relative
probabilities
its
more
likely
that
the
bds
started
the
fire
than
did
the
fbi
but
there
is
currently
no
way
to
decide
what
actually
happened
based
on
the
publically
available
evidence
which
is
nearly
none
even
if
the
bds
were
not
contemplating
suicide
it
is
very
possible
that
david
koresh
was
convinced
and
thus
convinced
the
others
that
this
was
not
suicide
it
was
the
fulfilment
of
a
profecy
of
some
sort
there
are
three
possibilities
other
than
the
bds
self
destruction
a
they
are
not
dead
but
escaped
via
bunkeretc
from
reports
of
the
inadequacies
of
the
tunnels
and
the
bodies
found
i
would
rate
this
as
highly
unlikely
b
the
fire
was
started
by
an
fbi
accident
this
is
possible
but
it
would
be
foolish
of
us
to
declare
this
outright
until
more
evidence
can
back
it
sure
its
possible
that
the
armored
vehicle
knocked
down
a
lantern
which
started
the
fire
why
was
there
a
lit
lantern
in
the
middle
of
the
day
near
the
edge
of
the
complex
its
anecdotal
evidence
that
has
been
contradicted
by
other
escapees
c
the
fire
was
started
on
purpose
by
the
fbi
this
has
been
suggested
by
some
on
the
net
and
i
would
rate
this
possibility
as
utterly
ludicrous
this
is
what
we
in
sciskeptic
would
call
an
extraordinary
claim
and
wont
bother
refuting
unless
someone
gives
any
good
evidence
to
back
it
up
d
the
fire
was
an
started
accidentally
by
the
bds
i
am
truely
amazed
that
i
have
heard
or
read
of
no
one
suggesting
this
possibility
with
all
the
tear
gas
and
the
lack
of
electical
power
in
the
compound
and
the
adults
wearing
gas
masks
it
had
to
have
been
chaotic
inside
i
can
easily
image
someone
leaving
a
lamp
too
close
to
something
or
accidentally
dropping
a
lamp
or
knocking
one
over
with
the
winds
it
would
have
quickly
gotten
out
of
control
so
we
are
left
with
two
reasonable
possibilities
that
the
fire
was
an
fbi
accident
and
that
the
fire
was
started
by
the
bd
i
find
the
latter
more
likely
based
on
the
evidence
ive
seen
so
far
no
i
think
that
d
is
also
quite
reasonable
i
personally
cant
really
asses
any
relative
probablities
to
either
of
these
probabilities
although
if
forced
to
bet
on
the
issue
i
would
probably
take
an
accident
either
fbi
or
bd
over
intential
setting
of
the
fire
i
would
also
like
to
add
a
comment
related
to
the
reports
that
bodies
recovered
had
gunshot
wounds
the
coroner
was
on
the
today
show
this
morning
and
categorically
denied
that
theyve
reach
any
such
conclusions
he
pointed
out
that
under
intense
heat
sufficient
pressure
builds
up
in
the
head
that
can
cause
it
to
explode
and
that
this
can
look
very
much
like
a
massive
gunshot
wound
to
the
head
which
is
quite
consisted
with
te
reports
ive
read
and
heard
in
short
theres
been
almost
no
evidence
corroborating
any
of
the
many
scenarios
as
to
what
happened
on
monday
we
should
remain
skeptical
until
more
information

no

or
perhaps
in
both
cases
if
there
is
no

then
science
has
no

worth
usefulness
or

if
nothing
is
inherently

then
simple
theories
with
accurate
predictions
are
not
inherently

or

do
you
see
any
flaws
in
this
the
problem
is
your
use
of
the
word
objective
along
with
values
both
definitions
three
and
four
are
inherently
subjective
that
is
they
are
particular
to
a
given
individual
or
personal
you
see
what
one
person
may
see
as
worthwhile
another
may
see
as
worthless
if
on
the
other
hand
some
things
have
objective
worth
usefulness
or

it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
they
are
again
your
form
of
measurement
in
this
sentence
that
being
of
worth
is
subjective
if
you
can
provide
an
objective
foundation
for
morality
then
that
will
be
a
good
beginning
im
not
willing
to
attempt
this
until
someone
provides
an
objective
basis
for
the
notion
that
science
is
useful
worthy
or
important
in
dealing
with
observed
facts
alternatively
you
could
try
to
demonstrate
to
me
that
science
is
not
necessarily
useful
worthy
or
important
in
any
situation
in
other
words
i
need
to
know
how
you
use
the
term
objective
when
i
find
that
my
usage
of
a
word
is
different
than
the
usage
of
that
word
given
by
another
person
i
try
to
find
a
standard
against
which
to
judge
that
usage
in
most
cases
the
dictionary
is
the
standard
i
use
here
is
a
definiton
of
objective
objective
adj
of
or
having
to
do
with
a
material
object
as
distinguished
from
a
mental
concept
having
actual
existance
unenfluenced
by
emotion
or
personal
prejudice
b
based
on
observable
phenomenon
by
this
definition
science
does
not
have
an
objective
worth
since
the
phrase
objective
worth
is
an
oxymoron
however
you
asked
something
a
little
differently
this
time
you
asked
for
an
objective
basis
for
a
notion
the
fact
that
the
use
of
science
as
an
intellectual
tool
is
responsible
for
changes
in
our
world
the
changes
are
material
and
thus
objective
would
provide
an
objective
basis
for
an
argument
however
the
conclusion
arrived
at
from
that
argument
that
science
is
good
is
subjective
i
think
that
the
problem
here
is
one
of
word
usage
take
a
little
time
and
read
the
definitions
of
these
words
objective
subjective
worth
value
morality
good
evil
i
believe
that
if
you
think
about
the
meaning
of
them
for
a
while
you
will
have
to
conclude
that
there
is
no

because
by
the
things
you
write
on
the
net
and
the
manner
with
which
you
write
them
you
show
me
that
you
made
up
your
own
god
and
are
attempting
to
pass
him
off
as
the
real
thing
i
got
news
for
you
yours
doesnt
at
all
sound
like
mine
your
god
doesnt
come
to
you
because
your
god
doesnt
exist
ive
gone
into
this
with
an
open
mind
ive
layed
my
beliefs
aside
from
time
to
time
when
ive
had
doubt
and
ive
prayed
to
see
what
good
that
would
do
i
dont
see
what
more
i
can
do
to
open
myself
to
your
god
short
of
just
deciding
to
believe
for
no
good
reason
and
if
i
decide
to
believe
for
no
good
reason
why
not
believe
in
some
other
god
zeus
seems
like
a
pretty
cool
candidate
i
am
sorry
brian
but
when
i
read
your
postings
i
do
not
see
an
open
mind
what
i
do
see
is
misunderstanding
lack
of
knowledge
arrogance
and
mockery
please
tell
me
what
more
i
can
do
while
still
remaining
true
to
myself
be
true
to
yourself
then
have
an
open
mind
and
so
end
the
mockery
gain
knowledge
of
the
real
god
put
your
presumptions
aside
read
the
bible
and
know
that
there
is
truly
is
a
reason
for
everything
and
there
exists
a
god
that
has
so
much
love
for
you
that
the
depth
of
it
goes
beyond
our
shallow
worldly
experience
a
person
who
commits
himself
to
seeking
god
will
find
god
jesus
stands
at
your
door
and
knocks
but
a
person
who
halfheartedly
opens
the
bible
or
opens
it
with
purpose
to
find
something
to
mock
will
find
learn
and
see
nothing
the
only
thing
one
will
gain
with
that
attitude
is
folly
be
careful
to
not
jump
the
gun
for
at
first
glance
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
will
seem
bizarre
and
absurd
be
assured
that
even
though
they
seem
alien
at
first
be
confident
that
they
are
not
be
assured
that
beyond
your
present
comprehension
there
lies
such
deep
reasons
that
once
you
see
them
you
will
indeed
be
satisfied
i
will
personally
guarantee
that
one
as
jesus
put
it
you
will
never
be
thirsty
again
your
cup
will
even
flow
over
from
king
solomon
bc
to
bc
it
is
the
glory
of
god
to
conceal
a
matter
to
search
out
a
matter
is
the
glory
of
kings
jesus
says
in
john
no
one
can
come
to
me
unless
the
father
who
sent
me
draws
him
and
in
john
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
one
and
only
son
that
whosoever
believes
in
him
shall
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
you
are
included
in
whosoever
and
i
also
pray
that
the
father
is
drawing
you
which
it
seems
he
is
doing
else
you
wouldnt
be
posting

remember
brian
you
could
be
a
st
paul
in
the
making
paul
not
only
mocked
christians
as
you
do
but
also
had
pleasure
stoning
them
yet
god
showed
him
mercy
saved
him
and
paul
became
on
of
the
most
celebrated
men
in
the
history
of
gods
church
you
see
brian
i
myself
better
be
careful
and
not
judge
you
because
you
could
indeed
be
the
next
paul
for
with
the
fervor
that
you
attack
christians
one
day
you
might
find
yourself
one
and
like
paul
proclaim
the
good
news
of
jesus
with
that
very
same
fervor
or
more
or
you
could
be
the
next
peter
what
jesus
said
to
peter
jesus
would
probably
say
to
you
satan
would
surely
like
to
have
you
why
so
because
peter
was
hardheaded
cynical
and
demonstrated
great
moments
of
stupidity
but
once
peter
committed
himself
to
a
task
he
did
with
full
heart
peter
was
the
only
apostle
to
have
the
faith
to
walk
on
water
as
jesus
did
you
asked
why
not
believe
in
zeus
zeus
didnt
offer
eternal
life
you
got
nothing
to
gain
by
believing
in
zeus

i
can

to

also
has

and
they
should
be

those
of

ahead
call
me
a
commie
but
youd
be
singing
a
different

if
i
exercised
my
right
to

your
daughter
he
broke
the
law
he
was
a
threat
to
society
they
did
there
job
simple
you
have
no
evidence
that
david
koresh
or
his
followers
were
packing
that
heavy
weaponry
with
any
intent
to
use
for
other
that
recreational
and
selfdefense
purposes
your
statement
that
the
public
also
has
rights
is
correct
only
is
parsed
as
the
individuals
who
comprise
the
public
also
have
rights
there
is
no
separate
rightsbearing
entity
known
as
the
public
since
the
rights
of
the
public
of
which
you
spoke
are
in
fact
only
rights
of
individuals
the
statement
that
the
rights
of
the
public
should
be
placed
above
the
rights
of
the
individual
has
no
meaning
you
have
artificially
created
an
illusionary
conflict
of
individuals
rights
when
you
speak
of
my
right
to
rape
your
daughter
no
person
has
the
right
to
rape
another
person
therefore
there
is
no
conflict
how
do
you
define
society
do
you
hold
that
this
society
is
a
rightsbearing
entity
which
is
separate
from
any
individual
people
how
do
you
define
a
threat
to
society
to
what

do
you

the

the
physical

of
the
processes
having
occured
in

these

exist
with

without

the
theory
tries
and
explains
the
facts
and
how
they
relate
to
the
rest
of
the
physical
universe
in
a
manner
that
is
both
coherent
and
useful
that
it
can
be
used

predictions
the

atoms

the
way
in
which
they
behave
regardless
of
whether
we
have
a
theory
to
try
and
explain
how
they
interact
or
even
why
a
theory
never
really
becomes
a
fact
but
a
theory
can
predict
the
existence
of
a
previously
unknown
fact
and
if
we
find
this
fact
as
the
theory
predicted
we
say
the
theory
is
supported
by
the
facts
a
theory
is
a
mental
construct
a
speculation
a
model
if
it
is
a
good
model
it
may
be
useful
in
science
a
theory
is
something
that
is
supported
by
the
evidence
considerable
evidence
sometimes
all
of
the
evidence
a
hypothesis
is
a
new
fledgling
theory
because
there
is
not
yet
enough
evidence
to
support
it
when
a
new
hypothesis
is
proposed
to
replace
an
existing
theory
it
must
explain
all
of
the
facts
that
the
current
theory
explains
and
at
least
some
of
the
facts
that
the
current

not

it

so
simple
im
surprised
that
this

a
quick

i

some

a

why

the

tossed

as

i
realize
it
is
normally
tossed
out
because
it
contains
miracles
but
what
are
the
other
reasons
far
from
being
tossed
out
the
gospels
are
taken
almost
universally
as
the
primary
source
of
information
about
jesus
i
am
curious
as
to
whom
mike
cobb
is
referring
who
tosses
out
the
new
testament
undoubtedly
a
few
naive
atheists
do
this
but
the
phrasing
of
the
question
above
seems
to
suggest
that
cobb
ascribes
this
more
broadly
perhaps
the
question
that
gets
more
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
is
why
except
for
some
naive
believers
who
unfortunately
far
outnumber
nonbelievers
both
naive
and
critical
are
the
gospels
not
taken
as
gospel
truth
that
faithfully
records
just
what
happened
two
thousand
years
ago
this
has
an
easy
answer
and
the
answer
has
nothing
to
do
with
miracles
no
text
is
taken
this
way
by
a
critical
reader
there
is
a
myth
among
some
naive
believers
that
one
takes
a
text
measures
it
by
some
set
of
criteria
and
then
either
confirms
the
text
as
historically
valid
or
tosses
out
the
text
i
suspect
this
myth
comes
from
the
way
history
is
presented
in
primary
and
secondary
school
where
certain
texts
are
vested
with
authority
and
from
writers
such
as
josh
mcdowell
who
pretend
to
present
historical
arguments
along
these
lines
for
their
religious
program
in
fact
most
texts
used
in
primary
and
secondary
school
history
classes
ought
to
be
tossed
out
even
the
better
such
texts
should
not
be
treated
as
authoritatively
as
descibed
above
and
josh
mcdowell
would
not
know
a
historical
argument
if
it
bit
him
on
the
keister
twice
let
me
present
the
barest
outlines
of
a
different
view
of
texts
and
their
use
in
studying
history
first
all
texts
are
historically
valid
all
texts
or
to
put
this
another
way
i
have
never
seen
a
notion
of
historical
validity
that
makes
any
sense
when
applied
to
a
text
second
no
text
should
be
read
as
telling
the
gospel
truth
about
historical
events
in
the
way
that
many
students
are
wont
to
read
history
texts
in
primary
and
secondary
school
no
text
this
includes
your
favorite
authors
history
of
whatever
every
text
is
a
historical
fact
every
text
was
written
by
some
person
or
some
group
of
people
for
some
purpose
hence
every
text
can
serve
as
historical
evidence
the
question
is
what
can
we
learn
from
a
text
of
what
interesting
things
if
any
does
the
text
provide
evidence
the
diaries
of
the
followers
of
the
maharishi
formerly
of
oregon
are
historical
evidence
the
gospels
are
historical
evidence
the
letters
of
the
officers
who
participated
in
the
vampire
inquests
in
eastern
europe
are
historical
evidence
the
modern
american
history
textbooks
that
whitewash
great
american
figures
are
historical
evidence
these
are
all
historical
evidence
of
various
things
they
are
not
much
evidence
at
all
that
the
maharishi
formerly
of
oregon
could
levitate
that
jesus
was
resurrected
that
vampires
exist
or
that
great
american
figures
are
as
squeaky
clean
as
we
learned
in
school
they
are
better
evidence
that
some
people
saw
the
maharishi
late
of
oregon
levitate
that
some
of
the
early
christians
thought
jesus
was
resurrected
that
many
people
in
eastern
europe
saw
vampires
return
from
the
grave
and
that
we
still
have
an
educational
system
that
largely
prefers
to
spread
myth
rather
than
teach
history
how
does
one
draw
causal
connections
and
infer
what
a
piece
of
historical
evidence
text
or
otherwise
evinces
this
is
a
very
complex
question
that

hello
ceci
my
name
is
tony
and
i
have
a
few
comments
on
your
rosicrucian
adventure
i
hereby
state
that
i
am
not
claiming
or
denying
membership
in
any
order
fraternity
etc
with
or
without
the
word
rosicrucian
in
the
name
of
the
organization
i
only
claim
having
done
some
homework
this
is
intended
as
a
friendly
article
and
if
at
times
it
seems
different
its
my
lack
of
writing
skills
showing
nothing
else
heck
english
may
be
my
second
language
and
then
again
maybe
not
by
now
i
proceed
i
had
an
ehum
interesting
experience
with
the
rosicrucians
or
at
least
rosicrucians
of
some
sort
last
sunday
lets
start
with
the
name
rosicrucian
i
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
body
and
being
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you
met
some
rosicrucians
you
mean
members
of
a
group
that
calls
themselves
rosicrucian
at
least
that
is
what
your
observation
suggests
id
prefer
if
you
would
have
stated
up
front
that
it
was
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
only
because
they
may
be
confused
by
some
readers
of
this
newsgroup
with
the
rosicrucian
order
amorc
based
the
usa
jurisdiction
in
san
jose
ca
this
being
the
rc
org
with
the
most
members
last
time
i
looked
of
course
most
members
does
not
necessarily
mean
best
anyway
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
claims
they
descend
at
least
in
part
from
what
was
the
goldundrosenkreuz
golden
and
rosy
cross
from
the
century
there
were
two
golden
and
rosy
cross
the
first
chronologically
more
alchemical
the
second
with
masonic
tinges
but
their
history
is
the
subject
of
a
complete
chapter
youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatever
had
been
presented
by
amorc
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
impression
ie
youd
probably
have
had
a
positive
impression
more
likely
than
a
negative
one
imho
the
first
guy
also
said
that
the
rs
are
a
mystical
christian
order
and
that
they
base
their
teachings
on
the
teachings
of
the
kathars
english
from
the
thirteenth
century
again
instead
of
rs
it
should
be
lectorium
rosicrucianum
it
is
curious
to
know
that
other
rc
orders
in
the
usa
claim
to
be
non
sectarian
the
cathars
were
a
heretic
christian
sect
that
directly
challenged
the
authority
of
the
medieval
catholic
church
they
flourished
during
the
century
century
which
saw
the
religious
zeal
expressed
in
the
crusades
and
also
the
growing
disillusion
with
the
catholic
church
and
the
worldly
ways
of
its
clerics
it
was
largely
in
response
to
the
churchs
unseemly
pomp
and
splendor
that
catharism
took
root
first
in
northern
italy
then
throughout
the
south
of
france
what
made
me
a
bit
suspicious
was
the
way
they
first
said
that
we
all
contained
something
divine
and
could
find
our
way
back
to
divinity
then
that
we
couldnt
become
divine
as
the
persons
we
are
currently
but
if
we
worked
really
hard
we
would
reach
eternal
bliss
i
dont
see
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
with
us
containing
something
divine
and
yes
i
dont
like
phrases
like
eternal
bliss
either
how
to
robotize
people
and
brainwash

a

subject
re
burden
of
proof
in
article
jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom
writes
the
default
condition
in
the
absence
of
a
preponderance
of
evidence
either
way
is
that
the
proposition
or
assertion
is
undecidable
and
the
person
who
takes
the
undecidable
position
and
says
that
heshe
simply
disbelieves
that
the
proposition
is
true
is
the
only
one
who
holds
no
burden
of
proof
this
is
why
the
socalled
weak
atheist
position
is
virtually
unassailable
not
because
it
stands
on
a
firm
foundation
of
logical
argument
but
because
its
proponents
simply
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
gods
and
therefore
they
hold
no
burden
of
proof
when
you
dont
assert
anything
you
dont
have
to
prove
anything
thats
where
weak
atheism
draws
its
strength
but
its
strength
is
also
its
achilles
heel
without
assertionsaxioms
one
has
no
foundation
upon
which
to
build
as
a
philosophy
its
virtually
worthless
imo
of
course
yes
as
a
philosophy
weak
atheism
is
worthless
this
is
true
in
exactly
the
same
sense
that
as
a
philosophy
christians
disbelief
in
zeus
is
worthless
atheists
construct
their
personal
philosophies
from
many
different
sources
building
nongodbased
ideas
in
the
same
way
as
christians
build
nonzeusbased
ideas
of
thunderbolts
atheists
no
more
base
their
philosophy
on
atheism
than
christians
base
theirs
on
the
nonexistence
of
zeus
the
weak
atheist
position
is
logically
extremely
assailable
any
logical
demonstration
of
the
existence
of
a
god
completely
destroys
it
as
soon
as
the
demonstration
is
made
in
the
presence
of
a
given
weak
atheist
atheists
in
this
newsgroup
are
barraged
regularly
with
attempts
to
provide
such
a
logical
demonstration
and
they
all
fail
miserably
in
fact
most
of
the
people
around
here
who
claim
the
strong
as
opposed
to
mathematical
atheist
position
do
so
on
this
basis
not
only
do
we
not
believe
in
a
god
but
also
all
the
arguments
presented
in
favor
of
particular
gods
have
to
date
proven
unsound
therefore
one
can
say
that
those
gods
as
argued
by
those
arguments
do
not
exist
this
doesnt
apply
to
such
philosophers
gods
as
are
defined
to
be
logically
undemonstrable
but
these
are
not
the
gods
of
popular
religion
and
the
coherence
of
such
claims
is
quite
questionable

i
found
this
on
the
net
at
my
college
it
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
what
do
you
folks
think
this
are
the
tenets
of
stan
as
handed
down
and
set
within
the
holy
book
of
stan
thou
shalt
not
spill
thine
drinks
or
waste
thine
food
for
all
that
is
is
sacred
and
to
waste
is
the
denizen
of
luc
the
infidel
all
who
waste
today
shall
have
not
tomorrow
thou
shalt
pay
heed
to
those
who
know
the
higher
calling
of
stan
so
that
they
may
teach
you
the
way
and
that
thou
shalt
become
one
with
stan
and
the
universe
shall
be
in
your
hands
thou
shalt
honor
thy
loved
ones
and
cherish
those
near
you
for
they
are
the
true
path
to
happiness
and
happiness
is
a
devine
gift
of
thy
lord
stan
stan
is
the
one
true
god
and
shall
be
taken
before
all
others
so
that
the
false
gods
will
know
that
he
is
the
one
and
all
who
oppose
him
shall
forever
be
banished
to
the
form
of
the
sheep
and
be
sent
to
the
flocks
of
luc
for
all
eternity
the
word
is
the
law
and
the
law
is
the
word
the
word
is
within
thine
own
heart
follow
the
path
and
be
true
to
thine
own
self
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
by
stan
thy
lord
and
saviour
thou
shalt
honor
the
faiths
of
others
for
it
is
their
choice
to
follow
this
path
and
do
not
think
less
of
others
for
being
of
a
different
faith
yet
even
in
the
face
of
these
false
gods
do
not
waiver
in
thine
faith
in
stan
and
hope
that
the
unbeliever
will
see
the
light
that
is
stan
thou
shalt
not
wrong
others
for
being
different
for
stan
cherishes
the
different
and
holds
freedom
in
the
highest
regard
for
to
do
less
would
be
to
fall
in
with
luc
the
infidel
for
stan
does
not
control
he
merely
guides
and
lets
the
choice
lie
within
thine
own
heart
thou
shalt
know
that
thy
lord
stan
has
many
names
and
is
called
differently
by
many
people
but
know
also
that
stan
is
the
true
name
and
all
those
of
the
faith
shall
know
that
stan
is
god
and
god
is
stan
thou
shalt
be
to
the
world
what
thou
art
to
thineself
for
to
be
false
to
others
is
to
be
false
to
yourself
thy
lord
stan
asks
not
that
you
be
like
him
he
asks
only
that
you
be
like
yourself
for
that
is
all
you
were
ever
meant
to
be
thou
shalt
not
kill
the
innocent
nor
spill
blood
unnecessarily
for
those
who
are
deserving
of
death
shall
be
dealt
with
by
stan
and
sent
for
all
eternity
to
the
flocks
of
luc
and
those
who
harm
the
children
of
stan
being
born
of
woman
shall
be
judged
as
the
sheep
of
luc
and
spend
all
of
time
within
his
flocks
these
commandments
are
the
words
of
stan
heed
them
and
he
shall
be
happy
and
if
thy

stan
is
happy
his

id
strongly
recommend
reading
when
prophecy

by
leon
festinger
henry
riecken
and
stanley
schachter
available
as
a
harper
torchbook
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
how
a

system
can
be
so
strong
as
to
withstand
even
overwhelming
disconfirmatory
evidence
at
least
read
the
first
chapter
interestingly
just
as
the
branch
davidians
had
roots
in
the
seventhday
adventist
movement
the
sdas
themselves
had
their
roots
in
the
millerite
movement
of
the
first
half
of
the
centurya
movement
that
expected
the
end
of
the
world
in
was
disappointed

it
did
not

re
did
he
really
rise
emery
the
one
single
historic
event
that
has
had
the
biggest
impact
on
the
world
over
the
centuries
is
the
resurrection
of
jesus
this
is
hardly
possible
as
the
majority
of
people
in
the
world
were
born
lived
their
life
and
died
without
ever
knowing
anything
about
christ
the
majority
of
the
rest
of
the
world
have
decided
that
he
is
not
who
emery
thinks
he
is
emery
why
were
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
documents
so
convinced
that
jesus
really
did
rise
from
the
dead
we
have
four
gospel
accounts
i
am
leaving
out
all
proofs
of
emerys
which
rely
on
quoting
the
bible
as
proof
circular
reasoning
etc
there
have
been
occasions
already
stated
many
times
for
later
generations
of
xtians
to
change
edit
or
otherwise
alter
the
bible
to
fit
their
political
gospel
and
if
we
accept
the
bible
as
true
just
because
the
bible
says
it
is
true
then
to
be
fair
we
have
to
do
the
same
to
the
bhagavadgita
and
the
koran
both
of
which
contradict
the
bible
enough
said
emery
yet
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
these
disciples
to
be
immoral
and
dishonest
we
have
no
historic
information
that
would
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
these
people
were
not
godfearing
people
who
sincerely
and
wholeheartedly
believed
that
the
resurrection
of
their
lord
jesus
was
a
real
event
and
for
what
gain
would
they
lie
to
make
a
stand
at
that
time
meant
persecution
imprisonment
and
perhaps
even
death
again
this
is
only
the
biblical
account
and
there
is
no
independent
proof
of
any
of
this
happening
it
just
isnt
there
besides
simply
being
sincere
or
willing
to
die
for
your
faith
does
not
make
your
faith
correct
there
are
muslims
dying
in
bosnia
right
now
does
the
fact
that
they
are
willing
to
die
for
islam
mean
that
islam
is
the
correct
religion
emery
history
bears
out
the
persecution
of
christians
roman
historian
cornelius
tacitus
govenor
of
asia
in
ad
writing
of
neros
reign
alluded
to
the
torture
of
christians
in
rome
all
you
have
proven
is
that
these
people
were
tortured
for
their
faith
that
does
not
prove
that
their
faith
is
true
or
correct
it
just
means
that
they
were
sincere
in
their
beliefs
being
willing
to
die
for
what
you
believe
doesnt
make
your
belief
the
truth
its
not
that
easy
and
minority
religions
have
always
suffered
torture
muslims
suffer
torture
and
harassment
in
india
and
bosnia
today
all
religions
are
harassed
in
china
today
you
havent
proven
anything
so
far
emery
with
all
the
suffering
and
persecution
that
it
meant
to
be
a
believer
it
would
be
quite
probable
that
at
least
one
of
those
in
the
supposed
conspiracy
would
come
forward
and
confess
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
big
hoax
not
if
they
didnt
believe
that
it
was
a
hoax
emery
yet
not
one
did
it
seems
rather
reasonable
that
the
disciples
did
not
make
up
the
resurrection
but
sincerely
believed
that
jesus
had
actually
risen
from
the
dead
especially
in
light
of
the
sufferings
that
came
upon
those
who
believed
the
followers
of
muhammad
firmly
believed
in
the
miracles
that
the
koran
says
muhammad
performed
they
were
attacked
and
slaughtered
for
their
beliefs
they
didnt
denounce
muhammad
or
islam
if
you
are
correct
then
that
means
islam
is
the
true
faith
you
see
how
stupid
your
proofs
are
subject

judas
crucifixion
tyre
etc
frank
decenso
but
how
its
evident
from
the
texts
in
ezek
that
god
isnt
concerned
about
buildings
or
structures
god
is
concerned
about
people
the
people
and
leadership
ezek
never
did
return
as
a
city
others
may
have
come
later
and
built
a
city
but
the
people
and
leadership
that
god
prophesied
about
in
ezek
were
never
rebuilt
as
a
city
of
people

how
incredibly
fucking
stupid
of

the

is
referring

it

coerced

back
he
wont
this
time
i
doubt
that
sieferman
has
anything
to
do
with
you
dropping
out
its
probably
closer
to
the
truth
to
say
that
you
dont
have
the
cards
to
play
in
this
game
because
you
insist
on
playing
from
a
losing
hand
and
youre
finally
realizing

you
will
lurk
on
the

and
keep
quiet
for
a
while
looking
for
an
area
where
you
are
certain
that
you
are
correct

then
well
see
you
pop
back
in

if
you

you
would

jesus
means
by
life
in

but
as
is
you
bumbled
around
asserted
your
standard
axiom
that
the

is
bunk
and
came
up
with
the

idea
also
you

you
will
find
that
eternal

is
quite
different
than
what
you
think
eternal
life
starts
nowan
infinitely
high
quality
of
life
living
in
fellowship
with
god
in
short
even
if
your
deity
does
exist
that
doesnt
automatically
mean
that
i
would
worship
it
i
am
content
to
live
my
own
life
and
fend
for
myself
so
when
i
die
i
can
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
where
i
end
up
it
will
be
because
of
my
actions
and
my
choices
if
your
god
decides
to
toss
me
into
a
flaming
pit
for
this
then
so
be
it
i
would
much
rather
just
cease
to
exist
but
if
your
god
wants
my
respect
and
my
obedience
then
it
had
better
earn
these
and
if
it
does
then
they
will
be
very
strong
and
true
if
my
diety
exists
you
would
not
just
cease
to
exist

all
the

as
if
it

that
will
level

he
just
rattles
them
off
day
by
day
some
brazenly
fly
in
the
face
of
common
sense
and
reality
and
i
point
these
out
where
i
can
the
truth
is
is
that
it
is
not
some
sort
of
magic
spell
the
truth
is
is
that
you
do
not
understand
it
and
enjoy
not
understanding
it
christanity
is
a
very
nice
belief
set
around
a
very
nice
book
wrong
again
christianity
is
supposed
to
be
relationship
you
do
not
even
know
what
christianity
is
and
you
are
arguing
against
it
and
in
my
opinion
youre
bumbling
about
blindly
making
up
entities
where
there
arent
any
and
depriving
yourself
of
a
true
understanding
and
enjoyment
of
your
life
as
long
as
you
keep
your
beliefs
to
yourself
ill
keep
my
beliefs
to
myself
but
as
soon
as
you
start
waving
them
around
expect
me
to
toss
in
my
opinions
too
just
as
i
make
up
such
places
as
jericho
jerusalem
babylon
corinth
ephesus
susa
and
such
kings
as
nebuchanezzar
david
solomon
sennacherib
herod

i

then
that
you
treat

did
it

uncomfortable
did
your

yes
thats
exactly
what
i
felt
my
heart
just
felt
that
what
i
was
being
taught
was
wrong
a
basically
good
message
but
framed
in
errors
i
could
not
with
a
clear
conscience
accept
that
women
were
somehow
not
equal
to
men
that
homosexuals
are
guilty
of
their

that
pride
in
ones
work
is
a
bad
thing
that
jesus
died
for
me
i
dont
want
anybody
to
die
for
me
especially
as
an
impersonal
act
where
the
person
cant
possibly
even
know
me
well
enough
to
really
know
if
im
worth
dying
for
or
not
i
was
never
able
to
accept
the
bit
about
jesuss
death
being
a
good
thing
if
that
means
that
im
just
not
comprehending
a
basic
message
of
christianity
then
so
be
it
maybe
im
just
not
compatible
with
christianity
i
just
refuse
to
follow
rules
blindly
and
since
i
cant
even
convince
myself
that
your
god
even
exists
in
the
way
you
describe
it
ive
got
to
just
follow
my
own
conscience
in
these
matters
i
know
how
that
goes
knowing
i
couldnt
and
didnt
want
to
live
up
to
those
impossibleand
rather
incovenient
rules
are
what
kept
me
outside
too
dont
think
that
my
morals
are
shoddy
or
nonexistent
just
because
i
dont
believe
in
your
god
i
will
not
steal
and
i
will
not
murder
not
because
i
fear
divine
repudiation
but
because
these
just
arent
in
my
character
you
may
think
theres
nothing
keeping
me
from
just
running
around
on
a
murdering
spree
stealing
things
when
im
able
insulting
people
for
the
heck
of
it
because
im
not
answerable
to
anyone
but
youd
be
wrong
im
answerable
to
myself
a
life
like
that
would
be
a
cheap
life
i
happen
to
want
to
earn
respect
in
myself
till
i
met
the
man
that
is
my
initial
break
with
christianity
came
after
a
lot
of
soulsearching
and
a
lot
of
wondering
why
i
could
no
longer
feel
the
presence
of
god
with
me
i
finally
decided
that
i
had
once
felt
this
presence
just
as
i
had
felt
my
mighty
teddy
bear
beside
me
when
i
was
a
little
tyke
protecting
me
from
the
monsters
under
the
bed
that
i
had
believed
in
god
just
as
i
had
believed
in
the
teddy
bear
as
something
of
an
emotional
crutch
to
protect
me
from
perceived
dangers
since
then
ive
never
abandoned
the
possibility
that
maybe
your
supernatural
trinity
does
exist
but
there
are
a
few
times
when
in
my
darkened
room
by
my
bed
i
have
set
aside
everything
i
believe
for
a
moment
and
called
out
to
whatevers
out
there
because
i
want
to
know
the
truth
even
if
it
means
abandoning
everything
i
know
and
i
have
not
yet
received
an
answer
only
when
i
truly
listened
to
myself
body
and
soul
did
i
realize
that
i
could
no
longer
honestly
keep
up
the
charade
of
being
christian
there
is
a
higher
truth
in
the
universe
and
christianity
just
aint
it
any
suggestions
on
what
or
who
or
where
it
might
be
and
why
nope
it
may
well
be
unknowable
scientists
have
suggested
that
the
universe
may
be
finite
and
wrap
around
on
itself
the
threedimensional
universe
may
be
mapped
onto
a
fourdimensional
supersphere
in
the
same
way
you
can
map
a
twodimensional
plane
onto
a
threedimensional
sphere
see
sphereland
the
sequel
to
flatland
for
more
thoughts
on
this
our
entire
universe
might
just
be
an
electron
in
a
four
dimensional
universe
which
in
turn
may
only
be
an
insignificant
speck
in
a
universe
above
that
and
so
on
and
so
forth
until
the
variables
become
too
much
for
us
to
even
speculate
on
that
is
theres
no
possible
way
for
us
to
know
exactly
how
we
came
to
be
so
theres
no
reason
at
all
to
believe
that
your
god
exists
nor
had
anything
to
do
with
it
ok
you
may
say
so
now
if
im
just
being
good
am
i
doing
good
enough
thats
for
you
to
answer
if
you
feel
youre
doing
fine
then
go
ahead
and
ignore
us
foolish
little
christians
we
can
present
what
weve
seen
and
experienced
providing
our
witness
but
it
isnt
up
to
us
to
make
that
seed
sprout
christians
have
provided
me
with
nothing
except
quotes
from
your
holy
book
and
all
sorts
of
tactics
to
try
to
get
me
to
believe
guilt
trips
insinuations
that
im
without
morals
arguments
from
disbelief
how
can
you
possibly
believe
that
god
doesnt
exist
and
so
forth
all
im
asking
is
for
you
to
convince
me
i
want
to
be
convinced
but
its
not
going
to
be
easy
so
much
as
you
dont
like
what
were
selling
there
just
may
be
someone
out
there
that
can
identify
with
it
methinks
you
could
give
us
all
a
lesson
in
tolerance
and
back
off
having
had
years
upon
years
of
contact
with
your
religion
from
both
the
inside
and
the
outside
i
view
it
as
harmful
in
many
ways
it
preys
on
people
who
want
to
find
meaning
in
their
lives
and
once
its
got
these
people
it
teaches
them
to
have
pity
and
sometimes
starkly
intolerant
of
others
who
do
not
share
these
views
maybe
youll
say
that
your
religion
doesnt
teach
that
but
ive
got
to
judge
christianity
from
the
christians
i
know
i
feel
that
it
is
entirely
possible
and
good
to
have
faith
in
ones
self
and
to
be
a
positive
influence
on
society
for
no
better
reason
than
that
so
i
hope
that
my
words
in
this
newsgroup
will
at
least
make
some
people
think
i
want
christians
to
realize
that
there
are
perfectly
valid
lifestyles
and
opinions
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
deity
whatsoever
and
i
want
people
who
are
considering
christianity
to
realize
that
christianity
does
not
hold
the
sole
key
to
a
happy
fulfilled
life
i
have
known
some
very
nice
christians
who
have
done
some
very
nice
things
i
think
what
sets
these
people
apart
from
the
general
masses
is
that
they
recognize
that
their
religious
beliefs
may
be
wrong
and
they
know
the
weaknesses
of
their
religion
yet
they
still
decide
to
believe
but
they
keep
their
beliefs
to
themselves
and
do
not
think
any
less
of
people
who
dont
agree
with
them
obviously
the
debate
on
the
veracity
and
reliability
of
the
source
of
the
christians
faith
is
far
from
conclusive
notwithstanding
how
vehemently
we
propose
otherwise
precisely
my
point
youve
still
not
given
me
a
reason
to
be
a
christian
instead
of
a
buddhist
or
a
moslem
the
nice
thing
about
religion
if
you
lose
yourself
deeply
enough
in
it
is
that
eventually
youll
be
able
to
feel
justified
in
most
anything
you
want
to
do
yknow
your
right
fortunately
for
everyone
around
me
im
not
religious
im
a
christian
just
as
the
moslems
arent
religious
and
the
buddhists
arent
religious

recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
he
is
god
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
god
granted
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creates
the
living
creature
to
examine
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
its
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becomes
a
threat
for
example
lets
say
the
scientist
creates
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
and
it
breaks
free
of
its
confines
and
starts
devouring
the
population
the
scientist
would
not
hesitate
in
killing
it
god
creates
us
to
be
his
loving
companions
he
knows
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
lets
us
know
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
god
cannot
abide
by
sin
by
rejecting
god
a
person
becomes
an
enemy
of
god
one
that
must
be
killed
by
him
note
i
say
that
god
and
god
alone
is
worthy
to
be
judge
jury
and
executioner
we
are
not
called
to
carry
out
such
duties
because
we
are
not
worthy
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that

the
rest

who

gods
chosen

god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a

chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
sorry
if
this
is
late
for
the
thread
but
i
thought
god
was
supposed
to
be
constant
and
neverchanging
how
do
you
reconcile
this
common
christian
view
with
the
paragraph
above
god
never
changes
he
still
loves
us
sending
jesus
was
one
of
his
attempts
to
reconcile
with
mankind
the
nature
of
god
has
not
changed
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind
and
loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
sinning
in
the
face
of
god
was
punishable
by
immediate
death
there
are
several
ot
passages
to
back
this
up
god
is
god
he
cannot
tolerate
the
prescence
of
sin
in
his
midst
and
the
israelites
knew
this
and
still
some
of
them
chose
to
disobey
and
were
destroyed
were
these
people
kind
and
loving
themselves
god
gave
them
every
break
he
could
but
in
the
end
he
really
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
seeing
as
how
we
were
failing
to
achieve
salvation
on
our
own
he
sent
his
son
to
die
for
us
to
be
the
ultimate
sin
offering
now
we
live
in
the
age
of
grace
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
does
this
an
admission
on
his
part
of
having
made
a
mistake
he
sent
his
son
as
a
consolation
to
us
out
of
love
now
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an
example
of
a
kind
and
loving
god
hey
lets
be
fair
for
a
moment
here
kind
and
loving
does
not
mean
a
free
ride
there
is
an
amount
of
give
and
take
as
in
any
relationship
parents
are
supposed
to
be
kind
and
loving
but
does
that
mean
that
children
can
do
whatever
they
want
not
part
of
being
a
parent
means
administering
punishment
when
the
child
is
at
fault
part
of
being
a
parent
means
giving
instruction
god
tests
us
through
the
trial
of
life
such
that
we
may
grow
stronger
he
teaches
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
the
consequences
of
our
actions
are
made
clear
to
us
be
it
heaven
or
be
it
hell
if
god
did
not
follow
through
with
what
he
has
warned
us
about
he
would
not
be
a
very
good
parent
in
parenting
if
a
parent
issues
a
warning
but
does
not
follow
through
with
it
the
children
will
not
take
that
parents
words
very
seriously
god
does
the
same
by
telling
us
who
have
ears
to
hear
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
by
lifes
trials
we
see
the
folly
of
doing
our
own
will
rather
than
his

warns
us
about
the

when

why

what
was

they

allow
me

jg
didnt
expect
to
find
you
in
the
devils
role
stephen
but
these
are
the
times
that
try
mens
souls
o
what
was
called
many
months
of
planning
was
probably
the
intelligence
collecting
paperwork
and
interviews
nine
months
as
i
understand
it
no
doubt
this
accounts
for
a
significant
amount
of
the
time
as
government
efficiency
in
spending
our
tax
dollars
would
certainly
seek
its
absolute
minimum
in
such
an
event
but
my
gut
instinct
says
there
is
more
at
hand
it
took
some
careful
preplanning
to
demonize
dk
to
such
an
extent
the
attack
meshes
well
with
more
restrictive
gun
control
legislation
that
seems
to
be
the
agenda
of
the
day
it
also
fits
a
pattern
of
increased
government
interference
in
personal
religious
beliefs
randy
weaver
is
now
on
trial
o
its
important
to
them
because
it
justifies
budgets
no
quarrel
here
the
big
bang
theory
is
always
apt
at
appropriation
time
they
just
dont
have
to
possess
a
single
motive
o
the
warrant
was
sealed
to
keep
from
jeopardizing
the
the
governments
case
i
certainly
think
publication
of
the
warrant
undermines
the
governments
case
since
it
makes
no
claims
of
illegal
action
therefore
the
federal
judge
had
reason
to
seal
it
but
i
am
reminded
of
senator
frank
churchs
remark
that
secrecy
is
the
trademark
of
a
totalitarian
government
there
is
rarely
sufficient
motive
to
seal
a
warrant
in
a
nation
of
free
people
o
there
was
probably
no
one
actually
exercising
oversite
instead
a
system
of
bureaucratic
rules
has
been
set
up
for
such
incidents
like
computer
programs
these
have
to
be
debugged
periodically
especially
when
used
in
fringe
areas
cf
the
hostage
rescue
program
therefore
no
one
was
in
charge
and
no
one
can
reasonably
be
held
responsible
how
can
i
argue
with
irrefutable
logic
i
have
long
suspected
that
the
government
has
become
a
mindless
machine
and
now
you
go
and
confirm
my
worst
fears
has
it
become
a
beast
that
is
programmed
simply
to
say
kiss
my
toe
and
you
get
your
piece
of
the
pie
i
suspect
bugs
in
the
program
arise
when
agents
or
those
who
love
this
critter
have
independent
thoughts
o
what
they
were
after
generally
speaking
is
protecting

i

i
also
ask
myself
the
question
why
did
they
plan
for
so
many
months
why
was
this
so
important
to
them
what
was
the
government
really
up
to
why
did
they
seal
the
warrant
were
they
after
koresh
or
were
they
after
the
first
and
second
amendments
among
others
allow
me
to
play
devils
advocate
a
moment
jg
o
what
was
called
many
months
of
planning
was
probably
the
intelligence
collecting
paperwork
and
interviews
o
its
important
to
them
because
it
justifies
budgets
o
the
warrant
was
sealed
to
keep
from
jeopardizing
the
the
governments
case
o
there
was
probably
no
one
actually
exercising
oversite
instead
a
system
of
bureaucratic
rules
has
been
set
up
for
such
incidents
like
computer
programs
these
have
to
be
debugged
periodically
especially
when
used
in
fringe
areas
cf
the
hostage
rescue
program
therefore
no
one
was
in
charge
and
no
one
can
reasonably
be
held
responsible
baloney
either
the
programmer
or
the
people
who
decided
to
let
their
actions
be
governed
by
the
program
are
clearly
at
fault
if
you
neglect
to
do
maintenance
on
your

and
the

goes
out
you
are

this
was
obviously
a
lot
different
than
the
ordinary
fbi
adventure
i
believe
that
the
federal
officers
had
a
conflict
of
interests
here
throught
out
the
whole
affair
it
seamed
to
me
that
they
were
chiefly
concerned
with
saving
face
rather
than
saving
lifes
its
true
that
the
bd
were
resisting
arrest
and
that
they
should
have
surrendered
when
they
first
realized
that
these
where
federal
officers
but
they
didnt
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
saving
face
unless
you
are
confusing
the
fbi
with
the
batf
who
are
the
ones
who
were
in
charge
of
the
original
search
warrant
but
when
they
didnt
the
fbi
should
not
have
treated
as
a
hostage
situation
it
wasnt
i
think
more
discussions
possible
independant

should
have
been

was

to

bargin

the

cant

fbi
negotitators
did
make
a

for
the
dividians
to
come
out
koresh
showed
he
was
not
negotiating
in
good
faith

there
is
no
reason
to

independent

would

any

richard

how

two

that

and
the

not

a

he
was
a

to

and
lies
now
before
everyone
gets
crazy
with
me
let
me
say
that
koresh
was
crazy
as
a
bed
bug
but
out
government
was
crazierand
they
lied
to
us
they
told
us
compound
had
been
under
survaillance
for
quite
some
time
yet
whoever
was
watching
the
place
failed
to
see
that
koresh
went
jogging
and
into
town
on
a
regular
basis
everyone
in
the
area
claimed
to
have
seen
him
and
wondered
why
they
didnt
pick
him
up
then
there
are
two
possible
answers
first
they
didnt
see
him
what
kind
of
survaillance
is
that
second
they
didnt
care
they
wanted
a
confrontation
they
wanted
publicity
and
they
got
it
after
the
first
battle
they
told
us
that
they
did
not
know
he
knew
they
were
coming
they
also
said
it
would
have
been
foolish
to
go
in
knowing
that
well
we
know
now
that
they
intercepted
the
informants
call
and
went
in
anyway
did
they
explore
all
of
the
possibilities
for
ending
the
seige
according
to
them
they
did
but
according
to
the
hartford
courant
the
woman
that
raised
koresh
his
grandmother
was
not
allowed
to
go
in
and
see
him
the
fbi
agent
who
she
spoke
with
was
bob
ricks
and
according
to
the
paper
he
said
a
lot
of
people
think
if
you
just
talk
to
them
logically
they
will
come
out
his
grandmother
raised
vernon
howell
koreshs
real
name
she
didnt
raise
david
koresh
someone
who
raises
you
and
loves
you
does
not
speak
to
you
strickly
on
a
logical
level
there
is
also
an
emotional
level
on
which
they
can
reach
you
heres
another
one
all
during
this
operation
the
fbi
has
been
claiming
that
they
feared
a
mass
suicide
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
something
must
be
done
now
they
claim
they
never
thought
he
would
do
it
i
knew
they
were
going
to
do
something
when
they
started
talking
about
how
much
money
this
was
costing
that
was
the
start
of
the
justification
part
part
of
the
plan
thats
when
i
knew
it
would
come
soon
but
back
to
the
plan
it
is
considered
cruel
and
unusal
punishment
to
execute
criminals
in
the
minds
of
many
people
but
look
at
whats
acceptable
they
knew
the
parents
adults
had
gas
masks
they
did
not
know
or
were
not
sure
if
the
children
had
them
so
the
plan
was
to
pour
the
gas
into
the
compound
the
mothers
seeing
what
the
gas
was
doing
to
their
children
were
supposed
to
run
out
and
that
would
only
leave
the
men
to
deal
with
i
spent
two
years
in
the
army
and
like
everyother
veteran
i
went
through
cbr
chemical
biological
radiological
warfare
training
part
of
that
training
is
going
into
a
room
filled
with
the
same
stuff
that
the
children
were
subjected
to
to
make
the
stuff
really
interesting
the
gas
also
has
a
chemical
agent
that
irritates
the
skin
you
think
its
on
fire
i
have
no
doubts
the
children
would
become
hysterical
its
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
never
want
to
do
again
this
was
the
plan
the
final
solution
we
waited
days
for
our
hostages
to
come
home
from
iran
we
gave
these
people
days
i
stated
on
several
occasions
that
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
this
whole
thing
that
the
government
could
point
to
as
a
success
well
fbi
agent
ricks
changed
my
mind
again
a
newclip
from
the
hartford
courant
and
while
expressing
regret
at
the
loss
of
life
he
suggested
that
the
operation
had
been
at
least
a
modified
success
because
not
a
single
federal
shot
had
been
fired
and
not
a
single
federal
agent
had
been
hurt
it
took
dead
children
to
get
us
that
new
definition
of
success
one
more
thought
the
government
claimed
that
they
believed
he
had
automatic
weapons
on
the
premises
he
had
a
license
for
the
caliber
machine
gun
they
knew
damn
well
he
had
one
they
also
knew
he
had
it
legally
still
without
the
element
of
surprise
they
sent
in
agents
to
get
him
for
all
of
this
my
president
takes
full
responsibility

my

were

the

is
blazing
guns
i
may
sound
paranoid
but
our
government
is
out
of
control
and
killing
a
few
federal
officers
make
knock
some
sense
back
into
it
hmm
the
police
strategy
of
bursting
in
with
weapons
drawn
clearly
marked
as
officers
and
yelling
police
repeatedly
this
is
used
every
day
to
bust
drug
houses
the
idea
is
to
awe
the
suspects
into
submission
with
surprise
and
display
of
firepowere
in
order
to
avoid
a
gun
fight
as
for
not
knocking
its
a
sad
necessity
in
many
cases
since
the
suspects
will
attempt
to
escape
or
even
fight
usually
this
strategy
works
if
it
didnt
then
it
wouldnt
be
used
so
commonly
now
would
it
whether
or
not
it
was
appropriate
to
use
this
strategy
on
the
bd
is
not
my
point
since
i
dont
think
any
of
us
have
enough
information
to
make
a
clear
judgement
on
this

i
merely
point

that
it

is

furthermore
we

and
never

what
should
the

do

even
if

thats
not

excuse

i
will
clarify
my
earlier
quote
gods
laws
were
originally
written
for
the
israelites
jesus
changed
that
fact
by
now
making
the
law
applicable
to
all
people
not
just
the
jews
gentiles
could
be
part
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
through
the
saving
grace
of
god
i
never
said
that
the
law
was
made
obsolete
by
jesus
just
for
reference
heres
the
earlier
quote
malcolm
lee
mleepostroyalroadsca
wrote
in
reference
to
leviticus
and
deuteronomy
these
laws
written
for
the
israelites
gods
chosen
people
whom
god
had
expressly
set
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
israelites
were
a
direct
witness
to
gods
existence
to
disobey
god
after
knowing
that
god
is
real
would
be
an
outright
denial
of
god
and
therefore
immediately
punishable
remember
these
laws
were
written
for
a
different
time
and
applied
only
to
gods
chosen
people
but
jesus
has
changed
all
of
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
sin
is
no
longer
immediately
punishable
by
death
there
is
repentance
and
there
is
salvation
through
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
not
just
for
a
few
chosen
people
salvation
is
available
to
everyone
jew
and
gentile
alike
these
are
two
conflicting
statements
to
say
one
is
a
clarification
of
the
other
is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
people
shifting
their
position
on
an
issue
it
irritates
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premise
that
no
change
was
made
what
about
deuteronomy
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesus
change
that
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
sure
he
does
this
however
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stoning
nonvirgin
brides
because
this
needs
no
clarification
are
you
going
to
deny
that
deuteronomy
is
not
patently
clear
in
its
intent
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
ill
agree
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharisees
that
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believe
in
it
depending
on
how
they
use
this
knowledge
they
can
be
scary
they
can
argue
any
position
they
desire
and
back
it
up
with
selected
parts
of
the
bible
such
pharisees
include
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualify
this
by
saying
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
believed
what
they
were
preaching
but
the
ends
certainly
made
the
means
look
frightening
however
just
as
scary
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bible
but
believe
every
word
in
fact
this
is
probably
scarier
since
there
are
far
more
of
these
people
from
what
ive
seen
in
addition
they
are
very
easy
to
manipulate
by
the
aforementioned
pharisees
since
they
dont
know
enough
to
debate
with
these
people
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
no
it
demands
obedience
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
personally
told
me
how
i
should
behave
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
doing
gods
will
by
doing
it
however
if
preachers
pastors
and
evangelists
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
people
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everything
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarcely
be
honest
with
myself
by
saying
im
doing
the
will
of
god
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
well
if
god
respects
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bible
about
eternal
damnation
for
nonbelievers
i
see
little
respect
eminating
from
the
god
of
the
bible
i
see
a
selfish
and
spiteful
god
god
be
with
you
not
yours
thanks
malcolm
lee
rob
lanphier
and
for
the
curious
here
is
my
earlier
post
hmm
for
a
book
that
only
applied
to
the
israelites
deuteronomy
jesus
sure
quoted
it
a
lot
mt
in
addition
he
alludes
to
it
in
several
other
places
mt
mk
jn
and
just
in
case
it
isnt
clear
jesus
thought
the
old
testament
isnt
obsolete
ill
repeat
the
verse
in
matthew
which
gets
quoted
on
this
group
a
lot
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
have
not
come
to
abolish
them
but
to
fulfill
them
i
tell
you
the
truth
until
heaven
and
earth
disappear
not
the
smallest
letter
not
the
least
stroke
of
a
pen
will
by
any
means
disappear
from
the
law
until
everything
is
accomplished
anyone
who
breaks
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
teaches
others
to
do
the
same
will
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
practices
and
teaches
these
commands
will
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
i
tell
you
that
unless
your
righteousness
surpasses
that
of
the
pharisees
and
the
teachers
of
the
law
you
will
certainly
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
mt
niv
in
pretty
red
letters
so
that
you
know
its
jesus
talking
this
causes
a
serious
dilemma
for
christians
who
think
the
old
testament
doesnt
apply
to
them
i
think
thats

the

indeed

misctaoism
be
maximized
calling
the
tradition
old

new

rather
unnecessary
and
only
leads
to
foolish
squabbles
there
is
no
doubt
that
nature
is
a
splendid
teacher
whether
she
appears
in
the
words
spoken
by
a
tree
or
by
a
stream
a
microbe
or
a

let
us
not
limit
misctaoism
to
philosophy
but
if
we
dont
limit
it
to
something
the
discussion
degenerates
into
a
big
amorphous
glob
other
questions
thyagi
proposes
are
what
is
this
actual
process
of
reality
why
is
taoism
based
upon
an
assumption
why
does
this
assumption
concern
knowledge
and
what
can
be
known
what
is
the
value
of
not
knowing
what
is
a
tao
what
does
it
mean
to
be
taod
it
seems
to
me
that
these
questions
more
properly
fall
into
the
category
of
general
metaphysics
i
would
prefer
any
misctaoism
to
deal
more
closely
with
topics
and
works
more
closely
associated
with
at
least
semiorthodox
taoism
with
established
classic
works
definitely
included
and
works
like
mantak
chias
argued
about
i
think
neotaoism
should
be
excluded
or
get
its
own
group
what
i
mean
by
this
is
humptydumpty
taoism
in
which
taoism
means
whatever
a
poster
says
it
means
this
alttaoism
could
also
be
a
refuge
for
debates
about
what
taoism
really
means
or
speculations
on
sexual
alchemy
etc
eg
from
thyagi
again
taoism
does
what
the
hell
it
wants
i
tell
you
taoism
doesnt
exist
taoism
is
no
more
real
that
tao
decide
now
real
or
not
real
exist
or
notexist
when
shall
we
be
certain
kent
gloomily
predicts
quoting
from
thyagis
article
however
most
traffic
in
the
group
will
likely
concern
the
philosophical
secular
taoism
averred
by
alan
watts
and
niels
bohr
and
yogic
taoism
as
it
pertains
to
medical
sexual
and
martial
techniques
i
think
that
discussions
of
this
nature
are
not
completely
out
of
place
whats
happening
is
that
that
the
term
taoism
is
becoming
completely
polluted
and
trivialized
like
the
words
magic
alchemy
zen
etc
by
writers
appropriating
the
word
to
mean
whatever
they
want
this
is
seen
by
the
spate
of
new
age
books
entitled
the
tao
of
this
that
and
everything
else
with
respect
to
some
exceptions
like
the
books
by
jou
tsunghwa
any
other
commentsideas
i
look
forward
to
seeing
them
on
balance
i
say
let
misctaoism
rip
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
if
it
just
gets
filled
up
with
college
freshmen
asking
about
the
tao
of
sex
then
it
will
have
been
a
failure
and
people
will
post

recently
ive

myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what

have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
he
is
god
in
other
words
the
right
of
might
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
god
granted
you
the
gift
of
life
whether
you
were
sinner
or
saint
in
other
words
he
can
do
it
he
did
it
and
your
in
no
position
to
argue
about
it
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
the
scientist
creates
the
living
creature
to
examine
it
poke
and
prod
it
and
learn
about
its
behaviour
he
will
kill
it
if
it
becomes
a
threat
for
example
lets
say
the
scientist
creates
a
tyrannosaurus
rex
and
it
breaks
free
of
its
confines
and
starts
devouring
the
population
the
scientist
would
not
hesitate
in
killing
it
god
creates
us
to
be
his
loving
companions
he
knows
whether
we
are
true
in
our
love
for
him
or
not
and
he
lets
us
know
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
god
cannot
abide
by
sin
by
rejecting
god
a
person
becomes
an
enemy
of
god
one
that
must
be
killed
by
him

i
say
that
god
and
god
alone
is
worthy

judge
jury
and
executioner
we
are

because
we

you

what

who

us
who
can

when
robert
refers
to
the
orthodox
he
is
talking
about
the
historical
position
of
the
christian
faith
such
things
are
derived
from
biblcal
texts
through
the
centuries
by
the
apocolic
fathers
of
the
faith
you
are
right
that
people
read
things
differently
in
the
bible
and
this
is
alright
in
parts
like
parables
and
such
forth
however
when
it
comes
to
the
essential
doctrines
of
the
historical
orthodox
christan
beliefs
there
is
only
one
correct
way
to
read
it
for
example
either
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
is
true
or
it
is
false
yes
people
read
the
texts
differently
but
only
one
position
is
true
they
both
cannot
be
according
to
the
text
the
doctrine
is
true
and
has
always
existed
therefore
when
people
like
joseph
smith
come
along
with
a
vision
and
thinks
he
can
undo
centuries
of
a
doctrine
that
is
supported
by
the

consider
him

why

whats
going

i
will
pass
on
psychologizing
answers
whether
dismissive
or
more
open
as
not
the
kind
of
issue
to
deal
with
here
the
question
is
what
is
the
theological
point
involved
and
it
has
been
quoted
at
me
often
enough
by
those
who
dont
believe
i
take
it
seriously
that
jesus
is
said
to
have
said
if
you
love
me
you
will
obey
my
commands
john
i
am
like
any
christian
the
slave
of
christ
and
it
is
my
will
that
i
should
do
as
he
wills
me
to
do
i
am
also
or
instead
his
younger
brother
but
still
under
his
direction
though
we
both
call
god
abba
christians
therefore
will
try
to
find
what
it
is
that
their
lord
commands
them
and
discovering
it
will
feel
obligated
to
do
it
or
to
confess
their
failure
readers
here
may
set
aside
the
theologizing
jargon
such
as
slaves
of
christ
the
point
is
that
adherents
of
a
religion
will
read
the
texts
whether
classified
as
inspired
or
not
that
are
held
up
as
models
in
an
effort
to
find
application
to
their
own
situations
this
practice
ranges
from
devotional
reading
of
sermons
and
the
like
to
the
exegesis
of
canon
ical
scripture
as
the
word
of
god
and
at
the
highest
pitch
this
leads
to
a
question
of
whether
we
can
find
in
inspired
scripture
something
that
can
act
as
absolute
guidance
for
our
actions
the
problem
is
in
finding
out
just
what
it
is
our
lord
commands
i
am
going
to
set
aside
for
this
essay
one
major
direction
in
which
christians
have
looked
for
these
commands
namely
christian
tradition
that
is
not
because
i
reject
tradition
but
because
my
primary
audience
in
this
essay
is
protestants
who
deny
tradition
a
determinative
value
in
favor
of
the
witness
of
scripture
the
question
i
want
to
deal
with
is
what
commandments
can
we
find
from
our
lord
in
scripture
and
that
turns
out
to
be
a
hard
question
if
any
of
my
protestant
inquisitors
would
like
to
turn
the
discussion
to
the
authority
of
tradition
i
can
accomodate
them
unlike
most
protestants
episcopalians
admit
claims
from
a
scripture
b
reason
and
c
tradition
on
roughly
equal
standing
earlier
in
john
than
my
quote
above
we
read
john
i
give
you
a
new
commandment
love
one
another
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
nt
where
christians
are
given
an
explicit
commandment
with
the
context
commenting
on
its
imperative
mode
pronouncement
by
jesus
at
the
same
meal
so
we
readers
infer
since
it
is
not
in
john
but
in
the
synoptics
jesus
says
take
this
bread
this
is
my
body
mark
cf
matthew
luke
corinthians
the
mode
is
imperative
greek
labete
and
hence
this
too
is
a
commandment
in
both
cases
we
have
to
infer
that
the
command
is
directed
to
a
wider
circle
than
the
immediate
collocation
of
disciples
because
we
judge
the
evangelists
point
in
mentioning
it
with
the
disciples
by
then
mostly
or
entirely
dead
is
that
we
are
expected
to
follow
this
as
a
commandment
from
our
lord
in
the
case
of
communion
pauls
mention
at
least
this
is
probably
true
of
the
evangelists
also
implies
an
ongoing
ritual
liturgy
in
which
these
words
operate
to
bind
christians
to
the
original
command
to
his
disciples
as
a
continuing
commandment
to
the
christian
community
i
am
entirely
comfortable
with
this
inference
but
i
must
point
out
that
it
is
there
between
us
and
the
occasion
on
which
jesus
spoke
the
command
i
take
it
as
a
clear
inference
at
the
very
least
the
evangelists
notion
that
all
christians
are
called
to
love
one
another
in
jesus
command
directed
at
the
disciples
but
i
have
to
call
attention
to
the
inference
the
command
cannot
apply
to
me
without
the
generalization
from
the
specific
context
of
its
statement
to
my
own
context
as
a
disciple
of
christ
all
reading
of
scripture
has
to
make
such
inferences
to
get
any
sense
out
of
the
text
whatsoever
this
is
a
general
problem
in
reading
these
texts
we
cannot
read
them
at
all
without
our
own
understanding
of
our
native
languages
in
which
we
normally
read
the
translated
texts
and
without
some
appreciation
of
the
original
context
and
at
points
the
original
languages
when
english
misleads
us
i
am
going
to
presume
in
what
follows
that
we
have
the
general
problem
of
how
to
read
scripture
under
control
i
dont
really
think
this
is
true
but
it
will
suffice
for
my
current
purposes
i
will
address
only
the
issues
that
arise
when
we
have
already
coped
with
the
understanding
of
a
year
old
text
from
another
world
than
the
one
we
live
in
questions
at
that
level
only
introduce
more
reser
vations
about
the
commandments
issue
than
will
be
found
stipulating
that
we
can
read
the
texts
as
the
original
audience
might
have
done
among
the
reasons
we
have
for
seeing
johns
agapate
allelou
as
a
general
commandment
not
merely
an
instruction
by
jesus
to
this
disciples
on
that
one
occasion
and
one
linking
it
to
the
synoptic
great
commandment
is
that
we
have
criticism
from
jesus
about
limiting
our
love
to
those
whom
we
congenially
associate
with
in
matthew
we
read
you
have
learnt
how
it
was
said
you
must
love
your
neighbor
and
hate
your
enemy
but
i
say
to
you
love
your
enemies
in
fact
the
leviticus
context
quoted
does
not
say
hate
your
enemy
it
is
merely
the
common
human
presumption
and
leviticus
is
at
pains
to
say
that
the
love
should
extend
to
strangers
amongst
the
people
of
israel
luke
in
expanding
on
this
same
q
context
goes
on
to
have
jesus
say
even
sinners
love
those
who
love
them
all
of
this
suggests
quite
strongly
id
say
that
limiting
the
scope
of
the
new
commandment
is
not
quite
what
jesus
has
in
mind
in
short
inference
leads
me
to
generalizing
the
actual
text
to
a
command
that
is
in
force
on
christians
and
with
objects
not
limited
to
other
christians
trickier
than
the
agapate
allelou
or
institution
of
communion
there
is
the
case
of
the
great
commission
where
matthew
mark
the
twelve
are
sent
out
to
evangelize
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
the
verb
is
imperative
kerussete
but
the
context
is
rather
specific
to
the
twelve
and
there
are
further
specifiers
as
in
do
not
turn
your
steps
to
pagan
territory
and
do
not
enter
any
samaritan
town
the
lukan
parallels
are
even
more
specific
to
jesus
final
journey
to
jerusalem
which
make
it
harder
to
see
this
generalizing
to
all
christians
than
the
previous
examples
that
hasnt
prevented
christians
from
making
such
an
inference
what
i
have
to
call
attention
to
is
that
such
inference
is
not
justified
in
the
text
nor
unlike
the
first
two
cases
i
cite
by
the
rhetoric
of
the
evangelist
urged
on
the
reader
still
paul
seems
to
have
felt
obliged
to
proclaim
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
close
at
hand
even
contrary
to
jesus
instructions
to
the
to
the
gentiles
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
so
christians
after
him
have
also
taken
this
as
a
commandment
in
the
sense
of
john
do
i
accept
this
i
dont
know
it
is
surely
rather
speculative
but
you
see
how
the
ripples
of
inference
spread
out
from
the
text
that
is
the
pretext
christians
may
infer
a
general
commandment
applicable
to
all
from
what
is
presented
in
the
gospels
as
a
specific
occasion
i
do
not
necessarily
object
to
this
kind
of
generalization
but
i
insist
that
people
who
make
it
must
have
an
understanding
that
they
are
reasoning
at
some
considerable
length
from
what
we
actually
have
in
scripture
there
are
assumptions
involved
in
this
reasoning
and
these
are
not
themselves
scriptural
though
people
will
do
their
best
to
justify
their
assumptions
by
other
references
to
scripture
which
simply
adds
more
inference
into
the
mix
lets
move
on
to
the
great
commandment
that
we
should
love
god
with
our
whole
hearts
and
minds
and
souls
this
is
perhaps
the
synoptic
equivalent
of
johns
agapate
allelou
and
yet
it
is
not
presented
as
a
commandment
in
our
texts
rather
the
context
is
controversy
with
the
pharisees
to
cite
matthew
but
when
the
pharisees
heard
that
he
had
silenced
the
sadducees
they
got
together
and
to
disconcert
him
one
of
them
put
a
question
master
which
is
the
greatest
commandment
of
the
law
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
here
though
i
accept
it
as
such
that
jesus
answer
is
meant
to
be
a
commandment
to
christians
he
is
answering
a
polemic
from
his
enemies
marks
account
in
casts
the
answer
in
a
far
more
positive
light
as
so
the
scribe
in
this
version
says
far
more
important
than
any
holocaust
i
need
to
point
out
that
this
word
originates
in
the
context
of
animal
sacrifice
forget
the
nazis
for
this
or
sacrifice
luke
is
intermediate
he
has
a
lawyer
posing
the
question
to
disconcert
jesus
and
gets
the
good
samarian
parable
for
his
pains
luke
the
contexts
here
are
so
confusingly
various
that
one
could
be
forgiven
for
drawing
no
inferences
in
no
account
is
this
said
as
if
it
were
obviously
to
be
taken
as
a
commandment
binding
on
christians
though
i
think
it
an
entirely
reasonable
conclusion
in
each
case
that
jesus
thinks
it
to
be
so
the
point
is
that
our
mental
gears
have
to
grind
a
cycle
or
so
to
get
to
any
conclusion
from
all
of
this
about
what
we
are
commanded
to
do
by
jesus
and
all
of
this
is
contingent
on
our
understanding
the
point
of
jesus
use
of
the
torah
in
the
all
quite
different
gospel
accounts
and
the
application
of
such
a
context
to
us
the
different
contexts
among
the
synoptics
are
curious
it
should
be
noted
that
only
in
luke
do
we
get
the
fixing
of
this
command
by
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
we
may
look
for
an
analogous
intent
in
matthew
where
gives
the
golden
rule
as
the
meaning
of
the
law
and
the
prophets
and
where
we
may
also
hear
an
echo
of
hillel
saying
the
same
a
generation
before
jesus
if
we
make
these
associations
which
i
think
are
entirely
reasonable
we
are
again
indulging
in
inference
the
texts
do
not
explicitly
support
us
rather
we
read
the
texts
as
having
this
kind
of
interrelationship
current
literary
theory
calls
this
intertextuality
my
discussion
of
why
the
agapate
allelou
has
to
apply
beyond
the
community
of
the
disciples
and
beyound
the
circle
of
christian
believers
applies
again
here
to
buttress
a
conclusion
that
this
is
despite
the
presentation
not
saying
so
explicitly
a
commandment
to
christians
few
christians
would
disagree
with
my
conclusions
but
i
must
point
out
that
they
are
conclusions
they
depend
on
rather
elaborate
chains
of
reasoning
that
are
simply
not
present
in
the
texts
themselves
the
contextual
problem
keeps
coming
up
more
and
more
severely
as
we
look
at
those
sayings
of
jesus
that
are
not
so
universally
taken
by
christians
as
commandments
and
we
get
some
really
hard
cases
take
divorce
mark
is
pretty
clear
the
man
who
divorces
his
wife
and
marries
another
is
guilty
of
adultery
against
her
cf
luke
except
that
matthew
has
an
escape
clause
except
in
the
case
of
fornication
this
seems
to
be
a
rather
clear
commandment
whether
or
not
we
take
matthews
reservation
and
some
christians
to
this
day
take
it
so
but
some
dont
at
least
in
practice
this
is
rather
peculiar
it
is
not
as
if
jesus
were
not
explicit
about
this
whereas
he
says
nothing
at
all
about
some
of
the
things
people
gnash
their
teeth
over
how
is
it
possible
if
the
commands
of
christ
are
clear
that
matthew
can
so
disagree
with
the
other
evangelists
of
the
synoptic
tradition
im
going
to
continue
this
examination
into
evermurkier
waters
but
this
is
enough
to
start
with
the
theme
is
finding
commandments
in
scripture
is
an
exercise
in
inference
our
inferences
are
informed
by
our
assumptions
that
is
our
own
cultural
biases
i
have
so
far
identified
a
very
few
commandments
that
are
generally
accepted
by
all
christians
and
yet
in
these
already
some
of
the
difficulties
start
to
surface
it
is
these
difficulties
i
want
to
discuss
in
my
next
essay
on
this
topic
the
divorce
commandment
already
strikes
at
some
of
the
difficulties
i
see
almost
no
evidence
that
the
people
who
are
so
eager
to
find
commandments
to
condemn
me
with
spend
any
time
at
all
writing
nasty
screeds
to
soccouples
or
misclegal
about
the
horrors
or
viciousness
of
divorce
or
demanding
that
us
law
refuse
to
allow
it
or
refuse
unrepentant
divorcees
places
in
their
churches
that
is
not
to
say
that
divorce
doesnt
enter
into
consideration
in
general
it
is
most
definitely
a
matter
of
concern
in
even
the
most
liberal
church
circles
for
example
a
wildly
liberal
episcopalian
priest
of
my
aqauintence
in
a
wildly
liberal
diocese
has
recommended
to
a
couple
who
approached
him
to
marry
them
that
they
have
a
private
secular
ceremony
before
a
judge
so
that
the
public
ceremony
he
celebrated
need
not
go
through
an
agonizing
examination
by
officials
who
would
just
as
soon
not
take
on
this
role
of
interpreting
the
commands
we
are
faced
with
as
christians
this
in
a
church
that
was
effectively
created
by
a
famous
divorce

when
are
we
going
to
hear
a
christian
answer
to
this
question
in
paraphrase
on
what
or
whose
authority
do
christians
proclaim
that
they
are
above
the
law
and
above
the
prophets
major
and
minor
and
not
accountable
to
the
ten
commandments
of
which
jesus
clearly
spoke
his
opinion
in
matthew
what
is
the
source
of
this
pseudodoctrine
who
is
the
pseudoteacher
who
is
the
great
deceiver
ok
heres
at
least
one
christians
answer
jesus
was
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
this
context
matthew
makes
sense
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesus
came
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfill
jesus
lived
under
the
jewish
law
however
he
was
the
culmination
of
the
promises
of
the
prophets
he
came
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
and
fully
obey
gods
purposes
verse
says
for
truly
i
say
to
you
until
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pass
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
the
key
to
this
verse
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesus
as
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
accomplished
what
the
law
was
supposed
to
accomplish
jesus
did
not
say
that
he
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
and
unless
im
mistaken
heaven
and
earth
have
not
yet
passed
away
am
i
mistaken
and
even
assuming
that
one
can
just
gloss
over
that
portion
of
the
word
of
jesus
do
you
really
think
that
all
is
accomplished
verse
whoever
then
annuls
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
so
teaches
others
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keeps
and
teaches
them
he
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesus
teaching
jewish
people
about
living
lives
under
the
law
this
makes
sense
then
why
didnt
jesus
say
any
jew
who
annuls
in
v
are
you
saying
that
all
of
jesus
recorded
words
mean
nothing
to
gentiles
are
you
really
saying
that
jesus
only
spoke
for
and
to
the
jews
jesus
didnt
mention
your
name
does
that
mean
he
wasnt
speaking
to
you
when
you
read
the
words
of
jesus
do
you
think
he
is
speaking
to
someone
other
than
you
in
general
it
appears
that
jesus
is
responding
to
some
criticism
he
must
have
received
about
doing
away
with
the
law
that
was
not
jesus
intent
at
all
you
said
above
that
jesus
was
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
are
you
saying
that
does
not
mean
doing
away
with
the
law
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the
law
as
it
should
be
lived
and
fulfill
the
promises
made
by
god
to
his
people
all
the
way
back
to
eve
gen
serpent
will
bruise
your
heel
but
he
will
bruise
his
head
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
they
shall
strike
at
your
head
and
you
shall
strike
at
their
heel
i
will
put
enmity
between
you
and
the
woman
and
between
your
offspring
and
hers
he
will
strike
your
head
and
you
will
strike
his
heel
and
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
it
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
looks
like
your
translation
has
taken
a
few
liberties
with
the
word
jesus
appeared
to
be
doing
away
with
the
law
because
he
did
not
honor
the
traditions
of
men
as
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularly
locked
horns
with
the
religious
leaders
of
the
day
because
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rules
only
gods
law
in
the
matthew
passage
jesus
is
defending
his
dedication
to
the
law
and
defending
himself
against
his
accusors
almost
the
entire
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedicated
to
helping
the
jewish
people
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweeping
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduced
by
the
pharasees
and
their
traditions
only
helping
the
jewish
people
in
galatians
paul
describes
the
relationship
of
jesus
to
the
law
in
this
way
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custody
under
the
law
being
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
was
later
to
be
revealed
therefore
the
law
has
become
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justified
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
sons
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
i
believe
this
says
that
after
christ
was
revealed
the
law
had
served
its
purpose
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
has
been
fulfilled
as
christ
said
he
would
do
you
are
using
your
interpretation
of
paul
as
an
argument
against
the
clear
words
of
jesus
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesus
are
the
same
personality
therefore
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesus
are
based
on
the
same
moral
principles
it
makes
sense
that
many
of
the
principles
in
the
old
law
are
reexpressed
in
christianity
reexpressed
care
to
define
that
a
bit
better
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
what
are
heaven
and
earth
gone
away
where
did
they
go
is
all
accomplished
for
example
revelations
explain
please
christians
relate
to
god
through
christ
not
the
law
it
also
makes
sense
that
new
practices
and
new
symbolisms
were
established
to
represent
the
mysteries
of
this
new
relationship
ie
baptism
representing
christs
death
burial
and
resurrection
rom
the
lords
supper
as
a
memorial
to
his
sacrifice
i
cor
and
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
commemorating
his
resurrection
matt
acts
again
your
interpretation
of
paul
versus
the
clear
word
of
jesus
do
you
see
any
problems
here
when
did
heaven
and
earth
go
away
when
was
all
accomplished
ok
thats
one
christians
explanation
i
dont
claim
to
have
all
these
issues
completely
settled
even
in
my
own
mind
and
i
welcome
other
christians
to
offer
other
alternatives
please
excuse
the
long
posting
thanks
for
your
interest
if
you
have
read
this
far
subject
re
whos
next
mormons
and
jews
would
someone
be
kind
enought
to
document
the
exact
nature
of
the
evidence
against
the
bds
without
reference
to
hearsay
or
newsreports
i
would
also
like
to
know
more
about
their
past
record
etc
but
again
based
on
solid
not
media
reports
my
reason
for
asking
for
such
evidence
is
that
last
night
on
larry
king
live
a
socalled
cultexpert
was
interviewed
from
australia
who
claimed
that
it
was
his
evidence
which
led
to
the
original
raid
this
admission
if
true
raises
the
nasty
possibility
that
the
government
acted
in
good
faith
which
i
believe
they
did
on
faulty
evidence
it
also
raises
the
possibility
that
other
self
proclaimed
cult
experts
were
advising
them
and
giving
ver
poor
advice
a
few
years
ago
anson
shupe
and
david
bromley
published
strange
gods
the
great
american
cult
scare
beacon
boston
and
the
new
vigilantes
anticultists
and
new
religions
sage
beverly
hills
both
books
suggested
the
possibility
of
tragic
results
if
selfproclaimed
cult
experts
were
ever
taken
seriously
perhaps
their
diagnosis
of
the
anitcult
movement
needs
investigating
in
light
of
the
waco
tragedy

i
can

only
people
proposing

are
doing

ask
this
question

ill
back

they
do
does
anybody
else
besides
me
see
a
vicious
circle
here
i
guarantee
you
the
people
who
want
school
prayer
arent
going
to
back
off
when
they
cant
even
manage

get
a
quiet
moment
for

to
pray

their

can

pray
any
goddamned
time
they
want
to
and
nothing

can

deal
with
their
doing

especially
if
the
prayer
is
silent
as
bursting
out
into
the
shema
yisrael
or
some
other
prayer
might
be
construed
as
disruptive
if
audible
no
one
ever
prevented
me
from
praying
in
public
school
they
hardly
even
prevented
me
from
masturbating

should
have
thought
better
of
someone
posting

can
you
manage

such
nonsense
without
shame
muslim
students
might
have
a
complaint
if
they
are
prevented
from
setting
out
their
rugs
and
doing
the
proper
ablutions
before
prayer
at
the
times
specified
in

jews
would
probably
like
the
opportunity
to
daven
with
tefillim
and
whatever
else
they
require
at
their
appropriate
times
i
do
not
see
them
complaining
though
muslims
and
jews
have
a
case
that
no
christian
i
have
ever
heard
has
been
able
to
make
the
christian
insistence
on
a
public

i
already
responded
to
this
on
one
dimension
but
afterthoughts
cause
me
to
make
another
independent
reply
the
problem
with
a
moment
of
silence
is
that
it
is
not
an
evenhanded
way
of
allowing
for
religion
amongst
students
in
the
public
schools
as
i
noted
before
muslims
need
more
than
a
moment
of
silence
in
order
to
perform
the
prayers
they
are
required
by
muhammad
to
do
and
at
least
orthodox
jewish
prayer
also
has
requirements
that
are
not
addressed
by
this
there
is
in
fact
a
highly
selective
bias
towards
christian
prayer
in
this
moment
of
silence
shit
and
that
is
especially
bizarre
in
that
christian
prayer
doesnt
need
this
stuff
a
christain
may
pray
totally
incognito
at
any
time
to
some
extent
this
is
true
of
muslims
and
jews
as
well
what
i
intend
in
my
first
paragraph
is
that
there
are
some
characteristic
forms
of
prayer
in
these
religions
which
do
need
special
times
andor
behavior
which
cannot
be
undertaken
without
an
observer
being
able
taking
note
of
it
a
christian
may
pray
at
any
time
silently
and
without
any
trace
of
his
activity
being
evident
to
others
that
may
or
may
not
be
true
of
the
other
religious
traditions
amongst
us
certainly
these
tend
to
have
some
forms
of
prayer
that
would
evidence
differences
from
americanprotestant
mainstream
religion
all
that
a
moment
of
silence
does
is
to
allow
that
one
tradition
which
doesnt
need
it
to
have
a
special
place
set
aside
in
the
public
schools
there
is
nothing
in
christian
prayer
that
requires
public
forms
or
rugs
or
phylacteries
or
anything
else
at
all
visible
to
the
outside
world
a
christian
student
may
and
probably
does
pray
at
innumerable
times
during
the
day
without
anyone
else
knowing
it
that
may
also
be
true
of
non
christians
i
am
not
claimng
otherwise
in
the
moment
of
silence
it
would
still
be
difficult
for
the
jews
to
gather
and
daven
for
the
muslims
to
do
their
ablutions
and
find
qiblah
to
mecca
and
engage
in
the
prescribed
forms
but
of
course
christians
can
do
their
thing
and
therefore
the
provision
is
nothing
but
a
disguised
attempt
to
encourage
just
that
luckily
there
is
a
strong
jewish
presence
in
this
country
and
i
as
a
christian
revere
some
of
the
jewish
teachers
i
had
in
public
schools
and
a
growing
muslim
presence
as
well
i
can
only
hope
that
the
political
forces
consequent
on
this
will
prevent
the
imposition
of
christian
forms
on
nonchristians
as
far
as
i
can
see
as
a
christian
there
is
nothing
in
this
moment
of
silence
campaign
but
an
attempt
to
use
public
social
pressure
to
force
children
to
adhere
to
a
pattern
that
is
biased
towards
christianity
and
as
a
christian
i
must
protest
such
coercion
for
what
its
worth
i
suspect
that
the
coercion
is
not
really
targeted
at
the
nonchristians
it
is
yet
another
case
of
failure
amongst
christian
parents
in
making
their
children
prayerful
so
that
they
want
the
public
schools
to
teach
what
they
cannot
manage
to
teach
despite
having
all

jesus
this
is
the
verdict
light
has
come
into
the
world
but
men
loved
darkness
instead
of
light
because
their
deeds
are
evil
everyone
who
does
evil
hates
the
light
and
will
not
come
into
the
light
for
fear
that
his
deeds
will
be
exposed
kent
sandvik
says
it
seems
we
are
dealing
with
a
blackandwhite
interpretation
brian
are
you
subtly
accusing
me
of
evil
things
because
i
never
saw
the
light
however
this
is
even
more
confusing
because
i
even
admit
that
i
dont
like
the
situation
where
im
not
informed
black
and
white
a
spade
is
a
spade
there
is
no
hidden
agenda
behind
this
so
stop
trying
to
look
for
one
it
is
an
easy
and
as
straight
forward
as
it
reads
kent
i
am
not
accusing
you
of
evil
things
jesus
is
accusing
you
and
it
is
not
only
you
that
he
is
accusing
he
is
accusing
everyone
me
you
and
everyone
in
the
world
is
guilty
whether
one
sees
the
light
or
does
not
seen
the
light
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
we
do
evil
things
we
do
them
regardless
jesus
uses
the
word
men
i
am
included
jesus
is
not
soloing
you
out
jesus
is
making
a
general
statement
about
out
the
sad
state
of
man
christians
are
not
immuned
from
doing
evil
things
a
christian
is
just
a
person
in
whom
the
holy
spirit
indwells
a
christian
can
see
the
evil
he
is
doingbecause
his
evil
has
been
brought
out
into
the
light
jesus
is
not
saying
that
just
because
evil
has
been
exposed
that
the
christian
will
stop
doing
evil
if
you
havent
seen
jesuss
light
your
evil
deeds
simply
havent
been
exposed
to
the
his
light
you
may
shed
some
light
on
your
own
your
human
spirit
shines
at
perhaps
candela
but
the
holy
spirit
shines
at
a
megacandela
the
holy
spirit
can
shine
light
into
places
inside
us
where
we
didnt
even
know
existed
so
do
you
see
jesuss
point
christians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
are
not
perfect
nonchristians
do
not
want
to
come
into
the
light
of
jesus
because
they
will
see
all
the
problems
in
their
lives
and
they
will
not
like
the
sight
it
is
an
ugly
thing
to
see
how
far
we
have
fallen
from
jesuss
perspective
do
you
think
you
want
to
know
how
really
ignorant
you
are
do
you
think
brian
kendig
wants
to
know
do
you
think
i
want
to
know
ego
verses
the
truth
which
do
you
choose
im
watching
the
news
about
a
man
who
saw
the
light
and
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
as
part
of
his
insight
into
the
light
i
dont
think
the
world
is
that
simple
and
if
you
act
in
such
ways
when
you
are
enlighted
then
im
a
happy
man
and
i
pray
i
will
never
receive
such
light
and
i
watched
koresh
too
an
imposter
who
thought
he
saw
the
light
who
made
sure
that
the
children
burned
to
death
sadly
as
part
of
his
delusion
it
is
even
sadder
that
the
people
who
died
with
him
chose
to
die
with
them
and
that
ignorance
was
their
downfall
to
death
and
kent
dont
you
bury
yourself
underneath
a
rock
with
an
excuse
like
bringing
up
koreshas
if
koresh
actually
had
truth
in
him
david
koresh
was
no
light
and
no
excuse
for
you
to
stay
away
from
the
real
jesus
christ
david
koresh
who
claimed
to
be
jesus
was
a
fraud
it
was
obvious
david
koresh
was
born
in
america
jesus
was
born
in
bethlehem
koresh
wasnt
even
a
good
imposter
having
missed
an
obvious
point
as
that
jesus
warned
of
such
imposters
in
the
endtimes
david
koresh
wasnt
anything
new
to
jesus
jesus
told
us
to
be
aware
of
imposters
years
ago
so
the
next
time
an
imposter
makes
a
scene
and
claims
to
be
jesus
ask
the
obvious
where
were
you
born
was
your
mothers
name
mary
if
the
branch
davidians
asked
that
simple
question
they
would
have
labeled
koresh
a
liar
right
from
the
start
the
wouldnt
have
followed
koresh
they
wouldnt
have
died
but
look
what
happened
their
ignorance
cost
them
their
lives
their
choice
to
be
ignorant
cost
them
a
lot
kent
since
you
studied
the

under

do
you
not

what
tactic
satan

do
you

the
serpent
of
genesis
used
to
tempt
eve
did
he
not
misquote
god
what
satan
used
on
eve
and
succeeded
was
the
same
ploy
he
tried
on
jesus
but
in
jesuss
case
jesus
rebuked
satan
back
with
the
bible
in
context
it
didnt
work
with
jesus
does
what
satan
did
to
eve
in
the
garden
and
what
satan
tried
to
do
with
jesus
in
the
desert
remind
you
of
what
koresh
did
to
his
followers
who
did
koresh
emulate
who
was
koreshs
teacher
koresh
did
to
his
followers
what
satan
did

of
good
and
evil
despite
knowing
that
it
would

we

as
a

i
found
johns
statement
not
at
all
ludicrous
please
allow
me
to
explain
myself
in
the
governor
of
missouri
governor
boggs
issued
his
socalled
mormon
extermination
order
the
only
crime
illegal
activity
the
latterday
saints
had
committed
was
their
religious
affiliation
their
antislave
stance
missouri
still
allowed
slave
practices
and
their
growing
numbersinfluence
in
missouri
i
guess
the
mormons
got
what
they
deserved
because
they
refused
to
bow
to
the
will
of
corrupt
and
evil
secular
authorities
this
disobedience
brought
upon
them
persecution
murder
and
finally
forced
expulsion
from
their
lands
and
settlements
it
is
significant
to
remember
that
these
secular
positions
were
held
by
average
people
and
that
at
the
time
almost
all
americans
were
pretty
homogeonously
christian
it
was
largely
the
mainstream
christians
disgust
at
such
practices
as
polygamy
which
resulted
in
their
irrational
hatred
true
but
that
is
exactly
the
problem
the
mormon
extermination
order
was
issued
not
just
by
a
christian
it
was
allowed
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
was
instituted
precisely
to
prevent
incidents
like
this
order
from
occurring
in
the
first
place
as
i
indicated
in
an
earlier
posting
your
irrational
hatred
is
clearly
evidenced
by
individuals
like
robert
weiss
who
could
have
been
gov
boggs
lieutenant
he
would
have
fitted
right
in
drewling
et
al
and
seems
a
modernday
occurrence
based
on
results
slander
persecution
misrepresentation
lies
denying
mormons
representation
in
their
own
user
group
etc
etc
in
intent
and
purpose
what
really
has
changed
the
situation
is
not
entirely
different
today
many
irrational
feelings
and
beliefs
are
justified
through
religion
i
dont
think
most
of
them
are
started
because
of
religion
but
religion
certainly
helps
justify
and
perpetuate
prejudices
and
practices
by
providing
a
neat
justification
which
discourages
critical
thought
true
as
evidenced
by
numerous
examples
as
i
am
sure
youre
aware
in
any
regard
mormon
history
alone
indicates
that
secular
authorities
and
i
dont
even
discuss
how
uthans
were
suckered
into
allowing
part
of
their
lands
in
becoming
nervegas
and
atomic
bomb
testing
grounds
is
far
from
being
trusted
or
righteous
have
things
really
changed
for
the
better
i
may
be
a
born
cynic
but
i
have
no
reason
whatsoever
that
such
has
been
the
case
in
the
early
i
believe
the
late
president
kimball
lds
church
leader
strongly
protested
federal
attempts
to
locate
the
mxpeace
keeper
missile
maze
from
being
built
in
utah
yet
another
inspired
decision
from
secular
authorities
fortunately
his
opposition
was
influential
enough
for
the
feds
to
back
off
do
you
mean
that
the
secular
authorities
are
some
continuous
group
of
people
with
the
common
and
uninterrupted
goal
of
harrassingeradicating
the
mormons
do
you
honestly
believe
that
the
main
reason
for
using
utah
for
nuclear
testing
etc
was
to
get
them
thar
mormons
and
what
about
the
majority
of
uthans
who
arent
mormons
you
seem
to
be
searching
for
enemy
correction
the
majority
of
utahns
are
mormon
i
believe
up
to
a
in
many
cities
and
settlements
throughout
the
western
states
conspiracies
it
is
paranoid
to
believe
that
everything
that
affects
you
badly
must
have
been
done
primarily
for
that
purpose
what
i
mean
is
that
secular
authorities
are
to
be
watched
as
we
believe
that
satan
has
been
given
some
power
and
dominion
over
the
earth
to
divert
truth
judgment
and
justice
in
addition
we
believe
that
the
adversary
has
power
to
influence
the
unjust
and
idolatrous
greed
for
money
would
be
a
good
example
in
order
to
bring
about
persecution
war
oppression
and
evil
combinations
as
an
intelligent
being
dont
you
suppose
that
the
destroyer
would
yield
his
influence
foremost
on
those
with
political
power
as
far
as
utah
is
concerned
what
i
pointed
out
were
some
horrible
examples
of
environmental
nightmares
imposed
upon
by
secular
authorities
which
have
brought
death
disease
ie
the
downwinders
and
environmental
contami
nation
i
am
hardly
paranoid
i
am
just
not
expecting
too
much
from
a
secular
government
that
may
not
share
our
values
and
faith
and
which
indeed
as
gov
boggs
et
al
may
be
out
to
harm
and
destroy
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
prophecies
in
my
church
indicate
that
in
future
years
global
persecution
against
mormons
will
so
increase
in
intensity
and
scope
that
paraphrasing
all
those
who
wish
to
escape
persecution
and
murder
must
flee
to
zion
zion
the
pure
in
heart
will
be
reestablished
in
those
days
and
it
aint
our
current
secular
authorities
who
will
rule
over
it
david
koresh
did
not
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
federal
authorities
or
the
security
of
this
nation
and
with
john
i
too
wonder
who
or
whats
next
i
personally
feel
that
we
should
try
to
stop
anyone
who
is
a
threat
to
the
life
of
even
one
person
sure
he
did
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
this
nation
but
he
did
pose
a
threat
to
the
lives
of
his
followers
that
much
is
definite
hmmm
definite
by
whom
until
such
has
been
established
beyond
reason
able
doubt
this
alleged
threat
may
have
been
less
than
the
threat
imposed
upon
him
and
his
followers
by
the
batf
and
fbi
who
killed
who
what
constitutional
right
did
the
atf
officers
have
to
invade
upon
private
land
and
to
force
themselves
into
the
compound
what
really
caused
the
murder
of
the
little
children
could
it
be
that
the
atffbi
presence
has
any
bearing
upon
the
events
how
would
you
interpret
the
mt
masada
events
blame
the
jews
what
the
heck
did
the
romans
do
there
anyway
what
business
did
the
atffbi
has
in
waco
texas
the
branch
davidians
never
posed
any
threat
to
society
this
is
like
asking
who
really
caused
the
deaths
of
the
israeli
olympic
team
in
in
that
case
the
police
botched
the
job
as
well
but
to
lay
a
heavier
burden
on
them
than
the
terrorists
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
i
think
the
same
sort
of
reasoning
applies
in
this
case
certainly
if
david
koresh
chose
any
peaceful
option
the
atf
and
fbi
would
have
complied
the
responsibility
is
more
his
than
the
authorities
come
now
at
issue
is
in
how
much
the
authorities
escalated
an
otherwise
peaceful
standoff
lets
get
it
over
with
and
force
david
koresh
to
come
out
by
gassing
them
were
they
naive
or
what
they
played
right
into
the
hands
of
an
apocalypticthinking
individual
he
had
prepared
his
people
for
this
eventuality
for
years
and
not
one
firetruck
or
plan
was
in
place
to
deal
with
this
scenario
i
feel
that
the
authorities
had
some
responsibility
to
protect
their
own
citizens
even
if
they
were
religious
zealots
and
guilty
of
not
paying
a
gun
license
has
the
batf
become
an
extension
of
the
local
taxcollectors
david
koresh
no
doubt
will
be
described
as
the
evil
guy
by
the
executioners
while
the
actions
of
all
those
valiant
and
brave
officers
characterizing
the
atffbi
as
executioners
is
inaccurate
and
unfair
in
order
to
be
an
executioner
the
least
one
must
have
done
is
have
the
intent
to
kill
que
intrusion
into
private
property
with
semis
loaded
with
life
ammunition
isnt
that
implicit
intent
or
at
least
prepared
to
kill
i
ask
you
would
the
batf
warrant
stand

just

id
clear
up
a
few
of
the
murky
areas
actually
after
surviving
being
driven
out
of
nauvoo
and
later
carthage
the
mormons
did
fortify
utah
they
still
arm
themselves
to
defend
the
faith
and
stockpile
food
as
well
they
have
been
involved
in
quite
a
lot
of
illegal
activity
including
multiple
and
often
underage
wives
for
the
leaders
a
practice
still
in
vogue
with
some
splinters
of
their
sect
the
parallels
between
koresh
and
joseph
smith
are
striking
by
they
you
mean
the
leaders
of
the
lds
church
i
grant
you
that
when
joseph
smith
was
still
alive
plenty
of
accusations
were
filed
most
of
which
had
little
bearing
with
reality
as
evidenced
by
various
verdicts
i
have
studied
lds
history
for
years
now
and
i
have
yet
to
see
prove
that
the
lds
leadership
was
involved
in
quote
illegal
activities
plural
marriage
yes
but
your
charge
of
underage
wives
sounds
like
it
could
have
originated
from
a
tabloid
and
discredits
the
high
moral
standards
which
characterized
these
leaders
and
families
unlike
as
it
appears
those
of
david
koresh
joseph
smith
started
the
sect
after
he
and
his
brother
hyram
were
murdered
in
a
nauvoo
il
jail
cell
church
membership
split
over
who
to
follow
initially
smith
was
considered
a
prophet
just
like
mohammed
a
rather
interesting
parallel
considering
muslims
consider
christ
to
be
a
prophet
the
same
as
jews
im
led
to
understand
make
no
mistake
this
was
no
messiah
were
talking
about
in
smith
the
and
neither
did
he
claim
he
was
as
the
church
reflects
the
moral
aptitude
of
its
leaders
and
especially
those
of
joseph
smith
i
have
nothing
but
the
highest
respect
for
this
inspired
man
whose
only
crime
was
that
he
refused
to
deny
that
he
had
seen
a
vision
many
have
tried
to
explain
the
smith
phenomenon
away
but
the
bold
presence
of
an
million
member
strong
church
stands
as
a
witness
that
joseph
smiths
testimony
had
enough
resilience
and
power
to
carry
on
the
message
thought
at
the
time
was
that
the
gift
of
prophecy
was
to
be
handed
down
father
to
son
after
joseph
smith
died
his
son
was
only
entering
his
teens
brigham
young
and
a
few
others
claimed
to
have
been
bequeathed
the
gift
and
leadership
prior
to
his
death
the
council
of
twelve
the
church
governing
body
wasnt
of
much
help
here
and
this
basic
conflict
is
still
a
wedge
between
the
sects
brigham
young
took
his
followers
to
salt
lake
the
rest
waited
for
smith
jr
to
grow
up
enough
to
assume
leadership
the
other
claimants
to
the
leadership
were
soon
ignored
like
mike
dukakis
the
rest
were
apostates
and
excommunicated
members
of
the
church
while
the
great
majority
of
the
membership
the
twelve
and
the
various
auxiliary
organizations
chose
to
accept
brigham
young
as
the
new
prophet
and
leader
of
the
church
if
you
knew
your
lds
scriptures
and
doctrine
you
would
have
known
that
brigham
young
was
the
first
in
line
to
fill
the
prophet
joseph
smiths
vacancy
he
was
the
senior
apostle
in
the
quorum
and
various
comments
made
by
joseph
indicated
that
it
was
brigham
who
would
lead
the
latterday
exodus
to
the
west
other
rightful
heirs
were
either
dead
hyrum
smith
or
excommunicated
oliver
cowdery
and
while
persecutions
abounded
and
intensified
joseph
smith
had
already
given
orders
to
look
for
a
new
place
an
empty
land
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
this
rekhabite
principle
pseudographia
was
well
understood
and
antipated
by
the
great
majority
of
lds
faithful
and
was
not
questioned
by
them
granted
a
couple
of
doityourselfers
stayed
behind
unwilling
to
sacrifice
and
to
undertake
the
perilous
journey
to
the
unknown
but
this
also
was
necessary
to
separate
the
tares
from
the
wheat
the
church
benefitted
from
this
purification
process
they
became
even
more
unified
and
willing
to
carry
out
their
mission
to
the
world
both
sects
practiced
the
food
stockpile
doctrine
and
this
being
frontier
and
farming
country
most
carried
or
at
least
owned
weapons
there
is
little
evidence
that
they
were
a
militaristic
sect
given
that
they
tended
to
move
on
rather
than
face
largescale
opposition
brigham
young
having
suffered
a
great
deal
getting
to
salt
lake
seems
to
have
been
quite
justified
in
making
military
training
a
good
thing
remember
this
was
far
beyond
where
even
the
us
army
went
and
these
people
had
nobody
to
turn
to
save
themselves
just
a
little
context
to
put
this
all
in
perspective
btw
since
when
is
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
one
of
the
largest
denominations
in
the
country
a
sect
it
didnt
splinter
from
any
other
religion
as
did
say
the
southern
baptists
or
methodists
so
what
did
the
mormons
get
it
seems
that
j
edgar
hoover
was
very
impressed
with
the
way
they
kept
secrets
theyre
pledged
to
defend
secrets
with
their
lives
and
atone
for
sin
with
blood
many
actually
do
even
to
the
point
of
suicide
what
a
balloney
suicide
is
sinful
and
against
the
law
of
god
i
am
not
comfortable
with
this
alleged
cosiness
with
mammon
i
assure
you
that
many
among
us
reject
this
attitude
categorically
period
our
only
true
allegiance
is
to
our
god
and
to
the
leaders
which
he
has
appointed
to
represent
him
in
any
regard
to
read
this
trash
about
suicide
and
atone
for
sins
with
blood
is
yet
another
insulting
misrepresentation
of
what
my
church
believes
in
and
stands
for
the
rlds
the
reorganized
lds
are
friendly
rivals
of
the
lds
and
delight
in
telling
stories
about
them
which
generates
quick
retorts
from
the
lds
members
and
everybody
has
a
grand
time
at
no
time
have
i
ever
even
heard
this
hinted
at
im
taking
it
with
a
salt
block
make
it
a
really
big
salt
mountain
with
a
glacier
on
top
so
he
hired
virtually
no
one
but
mormons
until
the
fbi
was
almost
exclusively
staffed
by
members
of
the
church
of
later
day
saints
though
j
edgar
is
finally
gone
the
fbi
personnel
especially
the
field
agents
are
still
heavily
mormon
i
have
often
wondered
how
this
might
affect
the
fbis
treatment
of
religious
organizations
a
mormon
would
consider
heretical
preposterous
even
if
this
were
true
reliable
data
please
i
am
convinced
that
those
officers
would
perform
to
the
highest
codes
of
honor
and
conduct
thats
why
they
were
selected
for
in
the
first
place
remember
besides
one
of
our
articles
of
faith
strongly
states
the
principle
of
freedom
of
religion
and
that
all
people
are
free
to
worship
how
where
or
what
they
may
if
its
true
there
would
be
little
affect
lds
and
rlds
philosophy
is
that
all
other
religions
have
strayed
from
the
true
church
as
set
down
by
jesus
but
that
god
will
judge
each
on
his
own
merits
in
addition
the
rlds
also
contend
and
the
lds
may
as
well
that
ignorance
of
the
true
way
tm
is
an
excuse
you
can
only
be
condemned
if
you
had
been
tought
the
way
and
rejected
it
in
short
lds
and
rlds
suffer
everybody
from
lutherans
to
buddhists
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
though
they
are
wrong
they
will
not
be
penalized
for
ignorance
it
is
more
likely
that
hoover
liked
them
because
of
their
rather
strict
upbringings
which
forbade
alcohol
tobacco
hot
drink
like
coffee
or
tea
and
the
like
these
people
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
as
such
are
more
easily
made
to
follow
orders
and
have
few
vices
to
be
used
against
them
a
good
explanation
i
can
accept
that
you
are
right
that
lds
people
are
sometimes
a
little
too
cosy
with
mammons
orders
the
late
president
kimball
for
example
was
an
exception
with
his
strong
opposition
of
the
selection
of
the
mx
peace
keeper
missile
maze
in
utah
thats
my
somewhat
educated
guess
anyway
both
sects
have
splinter
groups
that
dont
mirror
the
masses
but
these
are
small
and
rare
and
hardly
worth
noting
their
common
ancestry
none
of
this
has
any
relevance
to
guns

when

is
used
to
deny

we
have
reached
the
point
in

when
there
are
certain
crimes
that
are
so
heinous
that
to
merely
be
accused
with
them
one
is
automaticly
considered
guilty
and
deemed
not
to
have
any
natural

much
less

among
these
are
drug
abuse
sexual
perversion

political
incorrectness

billary
accused
koresh
of
having
sex
with
infants
he
had
been
accused
of
a
number
of
differing
crimes
inconsistantly
over
the
last
two
months
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
that
one
i
had
heard
child
abuse
but
this
is
somewhat
stronger
it
is
fairly
obvious
that
koresh
was
hiding
behind
the
children
and
ironicly
considering
his
apocalyptic
dread
believed
enough
in
the
american
peoples
inherent
goodness
to
believe
he
was
protected
it
is
truly
amazing
that
all
these
people
who
days
ago
had
never
heard
of
the
branch
davidian
now
believe
that
he
was
suicidal
crazy
a
child
abuser
and
a
immenant
danger
to
others
based
solely
on
what
the
government
spokespersons
had
said
remember
that
these
people
have
an
awful
lot
to
loose
if
it
is
found
that
they
have
screwed
up
but
they
dont
have
as
much
to
lose
as
david
koresh
and
his
followers
lost
for

stands
murder
is

biblical

consider

by
biblical
scholar
i
mean
an
expert
who
in

is
willing

let

they

they

they
want

are
not
trustworthy
by

and
others
ive
seen
this
claim
about
the
josephus
insert
flying
around
the
net
too
often
to
continue
to
ignore
it
perhaps
its
true
was
there
only
one
josephus
manuscipt
if
there
were
say
copies
the
forger
would
have
to
put
his
insert
into
all
of
them
by
the
same
token
since
josephus
was
a
historian
why
are
biblical
scholars
raising
the
flag

i
would

would
have
a
better
handle
on
these
ancient
secular
documents
can
you
give

documents

numbers
etc
jack
i
became
aware
of
the
claim
years
ago
so
i
decided
to
check
it
out
on
my
own
but
then
that
was
in
bn
times
before
net
so
here
are
some
references
see
robin
lane
foxs
the
unauthorized
version
where
lane
fox
writes
the
one
passage
which
appears
to
comment
on
jesus
career
is
agreed
to
be
a
christian
addition
in
my
realbert
sabin
response
to
jim
lippard
april
i
noted
that
consensus
is
typically
indicated
subtly
as
in
elaine
pagels
the
gnostic
gospels
to
wit
a
comment
attributed
to
josephus
reports
emphasis
mine
scholars
sometimes
do
not
even
mention
the
two
josephus
entries
another
subtlety
reflecting
consensus
so
far
as
i
can
deduce
todays
consensus
is
built
on
at
least
three
things
the
long
passage
is
way
out
of
context
origen
did
not
know
about
the
long
passage
and
the
short
and
long
passages
are
contradictory
i
dont
know
the
references
wherein
the
arguments
which
led
to
consensus
are
orginally
developed
does
anyone
biblical
scholars
as
i
defined
them
include
theologians
and
historians
the
former
like
the
latter
incorporate
historical
social
technological
and
ideological
contexts
as
well
as
theology
so
the
distinction
is
blurred
i
didnt
elaborate
on
that
sorry
in
turn
historians
are
compelled
to
incorporate
theology
cant
say
about
the
number
of
copies
these
were
however
bg
times
before
gutenburg
a
hundred
first
editions
seems
exceedingly
high
counting
on
one
hand
seems
more
reasonable
perhaps
those
mss
without
the
long
insert
if
any
because
anything
is
possible
have
been
destroyed
such
a
practice
is
certainly
not
foreign
to
religions
anyway
all
we
have

how

if
anything

such
as
in

quote
you

verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
if
youll
notice
he
also
reams
into
the
pharisees
for
mucking
up
the
law
with
their
own
contrived
interpretations
they
knew
every
letter
of
the
law
and
followed
it
with
their
heads
but
not
their
hearts
that
is
why
he
points
out
that
our
righteousness
must
surpass
that
of
the
pharisees
in

to
be
accepted

subject
re
merlin
mithras
and
magick
in
response
to
whittenfwvasaiccom
david
whitten
i
wrote
there
evidently
was
a
feast
of
bread
and
wine
associated
with
mithras
i
have
often
wondered
if
yeshua
intentionally
introduced
this
ritual
to
expand
the
appeal
of
his
religion
or
if
it
was
appropriated
by
later
worshipers
and
you
responded
you
could
argue
that
if
you
wanted
but
i
think
a
more
reasonable
argument
would
point
out
the
fact
that
the
remembrance
feast
was
very
similar
to
the
pesach
passover
meal
during
seder
a
very
jewish
ritual
of
course
the
feast
was
the
seder
and
the
accounts
of
it
are
very
clear
on
this
point
the
difference
is
the
connection
between
the
bread
and
wine
and
the
body
and
blood
of
god
this
is
an
old
association
of
the
tammuzosirismithras
line
and
not
really
related
to
judaism
in
any
case
i
didnt
really
intend
to
argue
the
point
i
saw
a
possible
association
and
pointed
it
out
but
i
havent
the
foggiest
notion
what
really
happened

actually
both

positive
may
not

the

description
here
due

its
the
term
you
used
positive
argumentsassertions
can
be
both
affirmative
ie
god
exists
and
negative
ie
god
does
not
exist
both
carry
an
equal
burden
of
proof
because
they
are
both
asserting
that
a
certain
idea
is
true
the
default
condition
in
the
absence
of
a
preponderance
of
evidence
either
way
is
that
the
proposition
or
assertion
is
undecidable
and
the
person
who
takes
the
undecidable
position
and
says
that
heshe
simply
disbelieves
that
the
proposition
is
true
is
the
only
one
who
holds
no
burden
of
proof
this
is
why
the
socalled
weak
atheist
position
is
virtually
unassailable
not
because
it
stands
on
a
firm
foundation
of
logical
argument
but
because
its
proponents
simply
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
gods
and
therefore
they
hold
no
burden
of
proof
when
you
dont
assert
anything
you
dont
have
to
prove
anything
thats
where
weak
atheism
draws
its
strength
but
its
strength
is
also
its
achilles
heel
without
assertionsaxioms
one
has
no
foundation
upon
which
to
build
as
a
philosophy
its
virtually
worthless

so
if
i
were
to
assert
that
there
are
no
thousand

andy
i
think
we
do
agree
given
your
clarification
of
how
we
were
each
using
the
terms
fact
and
theory
ill
only
add
that
i
think
perhaps
i
feel
more
strongly
about
separating
them
though
your
usage
is
quite
valid
note
that
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
in
other
words
it
could
theoretically
still
be
falsified
and
rejected
but
since
its
so
predictive
and
so
consistently
supported
by
evidence
it
seems
pointless
to
explicitly
try
to
falsify
it
anymore
ill
add
here
that
any
falsification
or
rejection
does
not
in
any
way
reduce
its
current
usefulness
so
long
as
it
accurately
predicts
or
describes
things
we
can
observe
not
to
be
a
pain
in
the
ass
but
is
there
any
reason
you
dont
just
say
the
theory
of
evolution
rather
than
the
fact
of
evolution
is
still
a
theory
im
asking
because
this
whole
thread
got
started
because
i
was
bothered
by
a
post
that
referred
to
the
fact
of
evolution
basically
leaving
off
the
phrase
is
still
a
theory
without
a
clarification
like
the
one
you
just
gave
just
saying
the
fact
of
evolution
has
a
very
different
meaning
to
me
description
of
atomic
theory
and
alternative
theories
of
gravity
deleted
both
are
very
useful
models
that
have
no
religious
overtones
or
requirements
of
faith
unless
of
course
you
want
to
demand
that
it
is
a
factual
physical
entity
described
exactly
the
way
the
theory
now
formulated
talks
about
it
here
is
where
you
fail
to
make
an
important
distinction
you
have
shoehorned
the
facts
of
the
existence
of
gravity
and
atoms
and
evolution
into
one
category
with
the
theories
which
have
been
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
the
existence
of
these
things
is
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
the
mechanisms
on
the
other
hand
are
still
worth
discussing
im
not
sure
i
agree
here
again
it
may
be
because
i
feel
stronger
about
separating
terms
i
was
trying
to
say
that
the
theories
proposed
to
explain
the
mechanisms
and
the
mechanisms
themselves
are
the
only
realities
here
it
is
the
existence
of
mechanisms
not
the
things
themselves
that
are
so
predictive
as
to
be
considered
fact
as
you
would
say
there
arent
really
little
planetary
particle
systems
called
atoms
out
there
or
i
should
say
and
more
to
my
original
point
it
would
be
a
leap
of
faith
to
say
there
are
because
we
observe
only
the
mechanisms
there
is
no
need
to
believe
there
are
actually
atoms
out
there
as
we
have
decided
to
think
about
them
its
enough
to
discuss
the
mechanisms
at
any
rate
im
not
sure
i
am
being
any
clearer
than
before
but
i
thought
it
was
worth
a
shot
the
bottom
line
though
is
i
think
we
agree
on
two
fundamental
ideas
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
my
way
the
fact
of
evolution
is
a
theory
supported
by
observational
evidence
your
way
creation
is
just
an
opinion
if
a
theist
wants
to
call
it
a
theory
then
he
can
i
wont
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
and
it
neither
predicts
nor
supports
any
observations
that
can
be
made
with
no
mechanisms
to
talk
about
there
really
isnt
much
to

re

there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
tyre
in
sum
ezekiel
prophesied
that
the
place
would
be
mashed
and
never
rebuilt
as
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
there
it
would
appear
that
ezekiel
was
not
literally
correct
this
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
because
i
understand
the
language
ezekiel
used
differently
than
do
socalled
biblical
literalists
for
example
it
sometimes
happens
that
someone
says
my
grandson
is
the
cutest
baby
and
then
turns
around
and
sees
the
granddaughter
and
says
oh
isnt
she
the
cutest
thing
this
person
is
not
literally
claiming
to
have
lined
up
all
the
babies
in
the
world
according
to
cuteness
and
discovered
his
own
grandchildren
tied
for
first
rather
he
is
trying
to
express
his
emotions
using
words
that
are
very
objectoriented
because
this
example
is
one
that
is
common
to
many
people
nobody
misunderstands
the
intent
of
the
statements
the
bible
however
is
often
at
the
mercy
of
people
who
assume
that
everything
within
must
be
exactly
literally
true
for
those
people
the
existence
of
tyre
is
a
problem
for
me
it
is
not
turning
to
the
latest
person
trying
to
defend
ezekiel
we
read
this
from
john
e
king
the
prophesy
clearly
implies
that
people
would
still
be
living
in
the
area
no
it
implies
nothing
of
the
kind
if
you
had
nothing
but
the
prophecy
from
ezekiel
and
you
were
told
you
interpret
it
literally
you
would
never
say
oh
he
means
that
there
will
be
houses
and
businesses
and
plants
and
stuff
like
that
you
would
read
i
will
make
you
a
bare
rock
and
you
will
never
be
rebuilt
and
youd
conclude
that
tyre
would
be
a
bare
rock
the
only
way
to
get
from
fishing
nets
to
houses
and
buildings
and
a
mediumlarge
population
is
if
you
know
that
all
that
latter
stuff
is
there
in
other
words
your
answer
means
that
ezekiel
misled
everybody
who
read
the
prophecy
at
the
time
it
was
written
there
is
no
way
that
given
a
literal
reading
they
could
read
this
passage
and
conclude
mediumsize
city
you
seem
to
feel
that
never
be
rebuilt
means
be
rebuilt
maybe
so
but
it
is
hardly
a
clear
implication
mr
king
also
writes
so
far
ive
seen
stated
figurers
ranging
from
to
lets
assume
the
latter
one
is
correct
by
modern
standards
we
are
talking
about
a
onehorse
town
well
no
thats
only
a
bit
less
than
the
population
of
annapolis
where
im
from
you
know
the
naval
acadamy
the
state
capital
george
washington
resigned
his
commission
in
the
statehouse
annapolis
may
not
be
new
york
but
its
at
least
a
twohorse
town
but
supposing
people
is
a
small
town
its
still
people
more
than
ezekiel
predicted
and
youve
said
nothing
about
the
other
problem
in
chapter
ezekiel
predicts
that
nebuchadnezzar
will
will
destroy
tyre
and
loot
all
their
valuables
however
nebuchadnezzar
did
not
destroy
tyre
and
in
chapter
ezekiel
even
quotes
god
as
saying
he
and
his
army
got
no
reward
from
the
campaign
he
led
against
tyre
lets
ignore
alexander
for
a
moment
and
just
pay
attention
to
chapter
ezekiel
says
n
would
destroy
tyre
and
n
did
not
destroy
tyre
ezekiel
says
that
n
would
plunder
their
valuables
but
n
did
not
plunder
their
valuables
regardless
of
what
you
think
about
tyre
now
the
fact
is
that
n
died
before
the
place
was
destroyed
ezekiel
said
n
was
going
to
do
it
and
n
did
not
this
post
is
of
course
pointless
inerrantists
have
an
amazing
ability
to
rewrite
the
bible
as
needed
to
fit
whatever
they
want
it
to
say
for
example
i
expect
mr
king
to
respond
to
the
comments
about
ezekiel
by
pulling
some
clear
implications
out
of
hat
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
towers
that
clearly
implied
that
the
walls
would
still
be
standing
so
people
would
know
where
the
towers
used
to
be
and
when
ezekiel
said
that
n
would
demolish
your
fine
houses
and
throw
your
stones
timber
and
rubble
into
the
sea
that
clearly
implied
that
n
would
never
set
foot
on
the
island
and
when
ezekiel
wrote
that
n
would
build
a
ramp
up
to
your
walls
that
clearly
implies
that
n
would
spend
years
stomping
around
on
the
mainland
and
never
get
close
to
the
walls
see
a
few
clear
implications
that
are
totally
contrary

tuesday
me
you
blind
fool
why
do
you
choose
ignorance
you
have
nothing
to
lose
if
you
look
but
if
do
not
look
you
will
certainly
lose
your
life
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
squashed
all
over
the
road
bk
it
is
my
life
to
lose
i
rather
not
look
besides
a
truck
running
over
me
will
not
harm
me
and
by
the
way
i
really
have
an
open
mind
i
think
the
discussion
is
more
like
this
me
happily
picking
daisies
by
the
side
of
the
road
bc
dancing
on
the
double
yellow
broken
line
come
on
out
and
play
on
the
highway
me
why
bc
the
highway
was
put
here
for
people
to
be
on
we
must
work
towards
fulfilling
its
purpose
me
but
bc
look
the
highway
has
been
here
for
several
generations
look
i
have
a
story
about
how
it
was
actually
created
by
a
divine
being
and
several
people
actually
saw
elvis
bless
it
me
but
bc
look
are
you
going
to
come
out
here
or
not
me
but
bc
you
probably
think
that
picking
daisies
is
fun
well
youre
wrong
me
where
in
blazes
did
you
get
this
silly
idea
that
youre
supposed
to
be
playing
on
the
highway
youll
get
yourself
killed
bc
better
to
be
killed
on
the
highway
than
to
live
an
empty
life
off
of
it
besides
youre
just
asking
pointless
questions
you
know
you
really
want
to
be
playing
on
the
highway
too
youre
just
denying
it
me
if
you
want
to
get
run
over
then
fine
but
id
much
rather
enjoy
the
daisies
if
you
please
bc
why
do
you
shun
me
like
this
the
creator
of
the
highway
will
flatten
you
with
a
steamroller
if
you
dont
see
the
light
and
come
join
me
me
well
if
hes
gonna
be
that
way
about
it
maybe
i
want
to
get
as
far
from
the
highway
as
i
can
bc
incoherent
but
quite
familiar
righteous
sputtering
brian
c
dont
you
see
i
do
not
believe
that
your
god
is
a
real
or
even
b
beneficial
in
fact
i
believe
your
religion
is
imaginary
and
carried
to
extremes
harmful
i
would
like
to
help
you
see
its
shortcomings
and
perhaps
someday
finally
become
strong
enough
to
see
it
for
what
it
is
an
elaborate
lie
kept
alive
by
the
elite
priesthood
to
keep
the
masses
properly
submissive
to
their
influences
please
offer
me
an
argument
thats
more
convincing
than
you
just
dont
believe
cos
you
dont
want
to
everything
youve
said
so
far
could
apply
equally
to
any
religion
why
do
you
believe
yours
is
the
real
one
note
that
saying
its
the
only
one
that
promises
eternal
life
or
something
like
that
isnt
an
answer
to
my
question
unless
you
show
that
a
no
other
religion
promises
eternal
life
and
b
it
is
unarguably
true
that
eternal
life
must
be
a
reality

jon

writes
this
is
quite
different
from
saying
employing
force
on
other
people
is
immoral
period
unfortunately
from
time
to
time
we
are
obliged
to
do
this
immoral
thing
for
reasons
of
selfpreservation
and
so
we
have
to
bear
the
moral
consequences
of
that
since
both
statements
to
all
intents
and
purposes
say
effectively
the
same
thing
are
you
serious
two
statements
one
of
which
says
that
use
of
force
in
the
given
situation
is
moral
and
the
other
of
which
says
it
is
not
moral
say
effectively
the
same
thing
yes
when
you
tag
on
the
unfortunately
then
to
all
intents
and
purposes
you
are
saying
the
same
thing
then
delete
the
unfortunately
now
tell
me
that
the
two
statement
say
effectively
the
same
thing
and
to
save
everyone
a
couple
of
trips
round
this
loop
please
notice
that
we
are
only
obliged
to
use
force
to
preserve
self
we
can
choose
not
to
preserve
self
which
is
the
point
of
pacifism
would
you
say
this
of
any
two
statements
one
saying
x
is
moral
and
the
other
saying
x
is
immoral
how
would
you
decided
when
two
statements
x
is
moral
x
is
immoral
actually
conflict
and
when
they
say
effectively
the
same
thing
what
they
prescribe
that
one
should
do
is
a
pretty
good
indicator
and
in
this
case
they
dont
prescribe
the
same
things
so
and
lead
one
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing
then
either
both
statements
are
doublespeak
or
none
they
might
lead
you
to
do
the
same
thing
but
the
difference
is
what
motivates
pacifism
so
they
obviously
dont
lead
pacifists
to
to
the
same
thing
thats
not
true
you
could
formulate
a
pragmatic
belief
in
minimum
force
and
still
be
a
pacifist
if
the
minimum
is
great
but
one
is
always
trying
to
get
as
close
to
force
as
possible
under
that
belief
not
the
same
as
force
is
immoral
period
but
still
tending
to
pacifism
if
you
dont
think
the
use
of
force
is
immoral
why
minimise
its
use

jon

john
nunnally
when
are
we
going
to
hear
a
christian
answer
to
this
question
in
paraphrase
on
what
or
whose
authority
do
christians
proclaim
that
they
are
above
the
law
and
above
the
prophets
major
and
minor
and
not
accountable
to
the
ten
commandments
of
which
jesus
clearly
spoke
his
opinion
in
matthew
what
is
the
source
of
this
pseudodoctrine
who
is
the
pseudoteacher
who
is
the
great
deceiver
ok
heres
at
least
one
christians
answer
jesus
was
a
jew
not
a
christian
in
this
context
matthew
makes
sense
matt
do
not
think
that
i
jesus
came
to
abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets
i
did
not
come
to
abolish
but
to
fulfill
jesus
lived
under
the
jewish
law
however
he
was
the
culmination
of
the
promises
of
the
prophets
he
came
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
and
fully
obey
gods
purposes
verse
says
for
truly
i
say
to
you
until
heaven
and
earth
pass
away
not
the
smallest
letter
or
stroke
shall
pass
away
from
the
law
until
all
is
accomplished
the
key
to
this
verse
imho
is
the
last
phrase
jesus
as
the
fulfillment
of
the
law
accomplished
what
the
law
was
supposed
to
accomplish
verse
whoever
then
annuls
one
of
the
least
of
these
commandments
and
so
teaches
others
shall
be
called
least
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
whoever
keeps
and
teaches
them
he
shall
be
called
great
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
taken
in
the
context
of
jesus
teaching
jewish
people
about
living
lives
under
the
law
this
makes
sense
in
general
it
appears
that
jesus
is
responding
to
some
criticism
he
must
have
received
about
doing
away
with
the
law
that
was
not
jesus
intent
at
all
he
had
come
to
earth
to
live
the
law
as
it
should
be
lived
and
fulfill
the
promises
made
by
god
to
his
people
all
the
way
back
to
eve
gen
serpent
will
bruise
your
heel
but
he
will
bruise
his
head
jesus
appeared
to
be
doing
away
with
the
law
because
he
did
not
honor
the
traditions
of
men
as
equal
to
the
law
of
god
he
regularly
locked
horns
with
the
religious
leaders
of
the
day
because
he
would
not
conform
to
their
rules
only
gods
law
in
the
matthew
passage
jesus
is
defending
his
dedication
to
the
law
and
defending
himself
against
his
accusors
almost
the
entire
sermon
on
the
mount
matt
is
dedicated
to
helping
the
jewish
people
understand
the
true
intent
of
the
law
sweeping
away
the
clutter
which
had
been
introduced
by
the
pharasees
and
their
traditions
in
galatians
paul
describes
the
relationship
of
jesus
to
the
law
in
this
way
but
before
faith
came
we
were
kept
in
custody
under
the
law
being
shut
up
to
the
faith
which
was
later
to
be
revealed
therefore
the
law
has
become
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
that
we
may
be
justified
by
faith
but
now
that
faith
has
come
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
for
you
are
all
sons
of
god
through
faith
in
christ
jesus
i
believe
this
says
that
after
christ
was
revealed
the
law
had
served
its
purpose
ie
our
tutor
to
lead
us
to
christ
and
now
we
are
no
longer
under
a
tutor
the
law
has
been
fulfilled
as
christ
said
he
would
do
god
the
author
of
the
old
law
and
the
christman
jesus
are
the
same
personality
therefore
the
old
law
and
the
new
testament
the
last
will
and
testament
of
jesus
are
based
on
the
same
moral
principles
it
makes
sense
that
many
of
the
principles
in
the
old
law
are
reexpressed
in
christianity
on
the
other
hand
now
that
the
law
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
and
christians
relate
to
god
through
christ
not
the
law
it
also
makes
sense
that
new
practices
and
new
symbolisms
were
established
to
represent
the
mysteries
of
this
new
relationship
ie
baptism
representing
christs
death
burial
and
resurrection
rom
the
lords
supper
as
a
memorial
to
his
sacrifice
i
cor
and
sunday
as
a
day
of
worship
commemorating
his
resurrection
matt
acts
ok
thats
one
christians
explanation
i
dont
claim
to
have
all
these
issues
completely
settled
even
in
my
own
mind
and
i
welcome
other

to

so
are
you
happy
now
when
people
including
innocent
kids
died
today
its
amazing
how
everyone
automatically
blames
one
side
or
the
other
one
thing
for
sure
koresh
will
have
no
chance
to
defend
himself
against
the
statements
lacking
in
fact
or
court
sponsored
verification
made
by
agents
who
participated
in
the
situation
that
killed
him
frankly
speaking
i
dont
care
who
started
this
whole
show
i
just
feel
sad
about
the
children
that
were
trapped
and
had
to
die
for
a
case
that
didnt
have
any
reason
whatsoever
all
mr
koresh
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
release
these
children
could
he
and
the
first
three
that
died
when
guns
ablazing
in
came
the
batf
and
fbi
i
imagine
i
would
have
some
trouble
giving
up
my
children
to
someone
who
had
just
shot
what
two
of
them
nb
it
takes
two
sets
of
guns
in
a
situation
like
this
yes
i
put
the
blame
on
koresh
and
similar
fanatical
religious
leaders
that
think
more
about
their
cause
than
about
keeping
fanatical
those
whowill
not
tolerate
anothers
way
of
life
religious
based
on
emotional
internal
or
otherwise
lacking
in
commonly
defined
scientific
basis
including
legal
ones
such
as
this
old
saw
innocent
untilproven
guilty
not
innocent
until
presumed
guilty
who
is
the
fanatic
note
who
is
dead
this
usually
bespeaks
a
fair
bit
for
the
idea
that
the
other
side
also
had
lethal
weapons
used
fatally
they
are
dead
the
children
at
best
koresh
was
an
asshole
and
the
government
criminally
negligent
in
its
hadniling
of
the
case
at

koresh
and
his

were

not

guilty
of
illegal
arms
possession

you

the
question
is
not
whether
but
how
guess
what
you
get
to
make
up
your
own
mind
on
that
children
out
from
the
war
zone
im
not
ashamed
of
this
statement
who
created
the
war
zone
you
should
be
ashamed
of
bypassing
that
its
the
same
damned
literally
comment
made
by
the
folks
in
the
former
yugoslavia
to
justify
ethnic
cleansing
gee
they
had
the
guns
all
they
had
to
do
was
surrender
to
justify
other
means
does
not
eliminate
the
fact
that
children
died
for
a
cause
that
they
should
not
have
been
part
of
whose
cause
did
they
die
for
the
one
where
they
lived
peacibly
to
all
known
purposes
until
proven
in
court
folks
or
the
cuase
of
righteous
government
safeguarding
the
freedom
of
the
children
who
are
now
dead
againi
say
i
do
not
know
who
did
what
i
was
not
there
the
fbi
leaders
show
moral
sickness
trying
to
convict
in
the
press
ahead
of
schedule
and
you
should
look
over
your
shoulder
becuase
if
there
is
anything
my
ruminations
that
actually
sets
onto
real
fact
of
what
happened
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
defending
people
who
ahving
been
burned
to
death
cannot
speak

themselves
you
may
in
years
find
that
the
concept
in
our
court
system
has
gone
from
due
processss
to
due
profit
and
the
batf
come
to
collect
their
fair
share
of
the
tax
on
the
value
of
your
house
if
you
rented
it
for
income
which
is
going
down
now
folks
read
bankruptcy
its
accurate
in

and
it
bypasses
the
greedy
businessman

nonflammable
mace
sold
tothe

is
supposedly
nontoxic
whatthey
do
not
tell
you
is
that
if
you
get
mace
directly
on
the

of
the
lungs
such
as
a
direct
snort
to
the
face
above
certain
quantities
it
reacts
similarly
to
a
mustard

inhalation
i
know
my

exposed
to
poison

in

and
wwii
dad
went
through

what
the

means
is
usually
it
wont

you
it
may
give

thats
better
than
blowing

all

are
flammable
if

hit
it

some

that
is
why
the

codes
say
no

i
think
that
the
consensus
will
become
that
fbiatf
muffed
it
not
merely
because
they
walked
into
an
ambush
on
feb
and
koresh
got
his
prophesy
today
against
their
stated
intentions
but
because
they
played
right
into
polarizing
the
situation
and
not
diffusing
it
koresh
had
set
up
all
the
conditions
of
a
classic
cult
confrontation
and
had
stated
publically
what
the
outcome
would
become
before
or
after
his
kids
were
shot
the
government
upped
the
ante
and
parcipitated
the
conclusion
today
it
does
seem
that
the
fires
were
set
from
within
the
compound
by
the
members
of
the
group
and
not
caused
by
the
cs
gas
or
the
way
it
was
delivered
let
the
subsequent
investigation
shed
light
on
that
suppose
then
why
make
the
comment
that
the
government
had
used
pyrotechnics
and
started
the
fire
the
dividians
still
had
the
decision
to
stay

leave
they
never
intended

did

do

the

give
me
a
break
what
fireman
should
have
to
deal
with
a
blaze
like
that
and
get
shot
at
at
the
same
time
nearly
all
of
them
witness
la
firemen
are
among
our
real
heroes
most
of
the
time
i
wonder
when
they
were
actually
aasked
to
come
or
if
they
found
out
about
the
fire
over
the
tv
shot
at
by
whom
prove
it
these
people
were
breaking
the
law
i
agree
these
werent
the
best
tactics
when
law
replaces
justice
the
system
is
dying
or
dead
note
that
we
had
a
small
revolution
years
ago
on
this
point
they
probably
should
have
backed
off
pulled
the
perimeter
way
back
and
let
them
sit
there
with
no
media
attention
until
they
decided
to
come
out
the
only
other
alternative
i
see
would
have
been
to
send
in
a
couple
of
special
forces
guys
to
capture
or
assassinate
koresh
but
remember
these
fruit
or
perhaps
just
wait
or
maybeeven
send
in
a
few
agents
who
are
christian
to
sit
down
and
pray
outside
the
line
try
affinity
rather
than
subversion
loops
were
putting
their
lives
on
the
lines
voluntarily
why
should
chuckle
so
would
you
if
someone
points
a
gun
at
you
at
that
point
you
can
die
or
live
and
if
living
means
stayng
in
a
building
to
keep
badge
carrying
nuts
off
your
kids
i
suspect
you
might
as
well
both
sides
were
wrong
lawabiding
citizens
have
to
put
themselves
in
any
more
danger
than
necessary
when
dealing
with
a
nut
look

the
man
who
jumped
out
of
his
bradley
to
grab
a
flaming
women
who
was
running
back
into

yeah
i
would
have
to
say
they
were
trying

save
those

i
dont

i

theory
on

koresh
my
theory
is
that
koresh
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
initial
gunbattle
and
died
on
day
of
the
siege
on
day
of
the
siege
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
periodically
appeared
to
his
followers
and
the
fbi
over
the
next
days
living
with
someone
whos
risen
from
the
dead
isnt
easy
as
timmy
batermans
father
in
petsematary
could
attest
so
after
days
they
did
what
baterman
didshot
themselves
and
burned
the
place
to
the
ground
consistent
with
the
facts
isnt
it

since
i

analyzing

very
closely
that
was
the
catalyst

my

it
was

difficult

fulfill

the
old

and
bring
about
a
new
age
of

growth
for

daniel
uses

messiah
in
daniel
chapter
how
closely
did
you
analyze
the
bible
looks
as
if
you
didnt
get
past
the
first
word
so
was
the
catalyst
to
break
your
faith
the
priests
who
interpreted
the
bible
for
you
did
you
ever
do

the

did

subject
theists
and
objectivity
can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
ive
often
found
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
theist
will
stick
to
some
kind
of
superstition
when
wondering
about
god
and
his
scriptures
ive
seen
it
in
the
christian
the
jew
the
muslim
and
the
other
theists
alike
all
assume
that
their
mothers
and
fathers
were
right
in
the
aspect
that
a
god
exists
and
with
that
belief
search
for
their
god
occasionally
the
theist
may
switch
religions
or
aspects
of
the
same
religion
but
overall
the
majority
keep
to
the
belief
that
some
creator
was
behind
the
universes
existence
ive
known
muslims
who
were
once
christians
and
vice
versa
ive
known
christians
who
were
once
jewish
and
vice
versa
and
ive
even
known
christians
who
become
hindu
yet
throughout
their
transition
from
one
faith
to
another
theyve
kept
this
belief
in
some
form
of
higher
being
why
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
but
it
doesnt
stop
there
once
the
child
is
able
to
read
for
himself
there
is
an
endeavor
to
inculcate
the
child
the
right
readings
of
scripture
to
concentrate
more
on
the
pleasant
readings
to
gloss
over
the
worse
ones
and
to
explain
away
the
unexplainable
with
mystery
circular
arguments
selfevdent
facts
and
truths
unreasoning
belief
and
fear
of
hell
is
the
meat
of
religion
the
child
must
eat
of
every
day
to
doubt
of
course
means
wrath
of
some
sort
and
the
child
must
learn
to
put
away
his
brain
when
the
matter
concerns
god
all
of
this
has
some
considerable
effect
on
the
child
so
that
when
he
becomes
an
adult
the
superstitions
hes
been
taught
are
nearly
impossible
to
remove
all
of
this
leads
me
to
ask
whether
the
theist
can
truly
be
objective
when
questioning
god
hell
heaven
the
angels
souls
and
all
of
the
rest
can
he
for
a
moment
put
aside
this
notion
that
god
does
exist
and
look
at
everything
from
a
unbiased
point
of
view
obviously
most
theists
can
somewhat
especially
when
presented
with
mythical
gods
homeric
roman
egyptian
etc
but
can
they
put
aside
the
assumption
of
gods
existence
and
question
it

you
keep
making
references
to
orthodox
belief
and
saying
ra
things
like
it
is
held
that
cf
kermit
thread
on
what
ra
exact
body
of
theology
are
you
drawing
for
what
you
call
orthodox
orthodox
is
a
compound
word
it
comes
from
orthos
straight
true
right
and
from
doxa
opinion
doctrine
teaching
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teaching
right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting
god
speak
to
us
through
the
bible
this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
luke
records
christs
promise
to
the
repentant
thief
who
hung
on
an
adjacent
cross
truly
i
say
to
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradise
but
was
it
not
until
later
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
to
heaven
if
christ
himself
was
not
in
heaven
until
sunday
how
could
the
repentant
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lies
in
the
location
of
paradise
when
jesus
died
apparently
paradise
was
not
exalted
to
heaven
until
easter
day
jesus
refers
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
story
of
the
rich
man
and
lazarus
as
abrahams
bosom
to
which
the
godly
beggar
lazarus
was
carried
by
the
angels
after
his
decease
luke
thus
abrahams
bosom
referred
to
the
place
where
the
souls
of
the
redeemed
waited
till
the
day
of
christs
resurrection
it
was
not
yet
lifted
to
heaven
but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hades
hebrew
sheol
reserved
for
believers
who
had
died
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admitted
into
the
glorious
presence
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redemption
had
actually
been
paid
on
calvary
or
even
that
none
would
precede
the
presence
of
jesus
back
to
glory
with
the
father
doubtless
it
was
the
infernal
paradise
that
the
souls
of
jesus
and
the
repentant
thief
repaired
after
they
each
died
on
friday
afternoon
but
on
sunday
after
the
risen
christ
had
first
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
john
and
her
two
companions
matthew
presumably
he
then
took
up
with
him
to
glory
all
the
inhabitants
of
infernal
paradise
including
abraham
lazarus
and
the
repentant
thief
we
read
in
ephesians
concerning
christ
ascending
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
he
gave
gifts
unto
men
verse
continues
but
what
does
he
ascended
mean
but
that
he
also
descended
to
the
lowest
parts
of
the
earth
ie
to
hades
verse
adds
he
who
descended
is
the
same
as
he
who
ascended
above
all
the
heavens
presumably
he
led
the
whole
band
of
liberated
captives
from
hades
ie
the
whole
population
of
preresurrection
paradise
up
to
the
glory
of
heaven
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
ra
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
think
that
this
characterization
is
faulty
whenever
my
personal
interpretation
is
questioned
i
usually
give
a
reason
as
for
those
that
see
things
differently
please
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
difference
and
we
can
discuss
it
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there
are
other
views
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from

then
we

hmm
it
seems
that
this

then
you

then
theres
this

that
will

feeling
brian
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
i
dont

at

i
do

i

however
ive
never

hanging

if
things
happen
wrong
i
will
try
to
learn
from
the

and
go
on
this
all
is
a
very
clear
indication
that
you
need
a
certain
personality
type
in
order
to
believe
and
adjust
to
certain
religious
doctrines
and
if
your
personality
type
is
opposite
then
you
are
not
that
easily
attached
to
a
certain

do

christians
are

perfect
nonchristians
are
not

nonchristians
do
not
want

in

and
they

it
is
an

thing
to
see
how
far
we

jesuss
perspective
do
you

do

the

i

life

anyway
i
recognize
that
im

that

soapbox
off
a
person
has
a
right
to
do
anything
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
rights
of
another
person
cool
enough
youll
have
more
trouble
defining
the
terms
in
that
statement
than
getting
people
to
agree
to
it
for
example
i
perceive
i
have
a
right
not
to
participate
in
what
i
feel
is
murder
i
dont
think
the
government
should
either
on
the
other
hand
since
we
are
having
trouble
proving
that
it
is
murder
there
is
no
right
to
stop
someone
from
doing
it
if
they
so
choose
either
by
legal
means
or
harassment
of
course
persuasion
is
allowed
but
watch
that
line
between
persuasive
and
harassing
the
second
part
is
a
definition
of
a
person
a
simplistic
explanation
is
that
a
person
is
a
member
of
society
most
normal
adult
human
beings
are
good
examples
of
people
most
children
over
two
years
old
are
people
as
well
the
simple
way
of
determining
this
is
that
you
can
have
a
conversation
with
them
it
is
actually
more
complicated
than
that
but
i
have
no
desire
to
spend
the
time
it
would
take
to
explain
it
to
you
read
the
thread
why
is
bodily
autonomy
so
important
for
more
explanation
and
justification
but
why
is
your
definition
authoritative
enough
for
the
whoe
us
surely
you
can
understand
there
are
other
definitions
with
equal
right
of
consideration
then
please
justify
why
being
human
automatically
makes
something
valuable
and
why
that
includes
the
unborn
if
the
government
refused
to
fun
abortions
due
to
the
qualms
of
a
minority
of
the
population
then
it
would
then
have
to
pay
far
more
in
the
delivery
of
babies
whose
mothers
wanted
an
abortion
but
could
not
afford
one
and
now
that
baby
will
also
require
care
for
years
true
that
needs
to
be
fixed
it
is
part
of
the
problem
if
clinton
has
a
medical
program
to
get
underway
let
him
address
this
too
it
is
cheaper
in
the
long
run
to
save
lives
later
they
will
be
productive
members
of
society
at
least
if
his
plan
works
no
they
are
not
guaranteed
to
become
productive
members
of
society
even
if
they
do
that
is
many
years
in
the
futureuntil
which
they
are
a
burden
on
someone
or
society
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
mother
forcing
her
to
carry
a
pregnancy
to
term
at
a
critical
time
in
her
life
could
prevent
her
from
being
a
productive
member
of
society
actually
i
was
refering
to
the
minority
that
objects
to
abortion
not
those
who
object
to
federal
funding
i
admit
i
did
not
say
it
very
clearly
and
apologize
for
that
to
refuse
to
fund
abortions
is
to
remove
that
choice
from
some
women
and
add
the
additional
burden
to
society
for
no
reason
no
this
is
really
flawed
logic
it
would
be
like
me
saying
i
was
born
with
a
disfigured
face
and
i
want
cosmetic
repair
it
is
discriminatory
that
i
cannot
make
that
choice
and
so
you
must
pay
for
it
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
make
a
choice
does
not
imply
legally
or
otherwise
that
someone
else
should
foot
the
bill
sic
for
that
choice
ok
look
its
like
this
we
are
footing
the
bill
maybe
they
will
take
choice
a
maybe
they
will
take
choice
b
maybe
they
will
take
choice
c
they
cant
afford
any
one
of
them
if
they
take
choice
a
wed
have
to
pay
them
say
if
they
take
choice
b
it
would
cost
us
if
they
take
choice
c
it
will
cost
us
now
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
for
the
next
years
which
one
sounds
the
most
realistic
for
us
to
be
willing
to
pay
for
now
some
people
happen
not
to
like
choice
a
other
people
happen
not
to
like
choice
c
paying
for
it
that
is
c
has
been
around
and
paid
for
for
years
even
though
it
means
we
spend
a
lot
of
money
we
cant
in
conscience
refuse
to
pay
for
it
now
a
has
been
around
and
is
perfectly
legal
but
it
hasnt
been
funded
in
the
past
now
a
is
going
to
be
funded
but
some
people
object
they
dont
like
the
idea
of
their
tax
money
going
to
pay
for
choice
a
so
we
could
refuse
to
fund
a
at
all
then
those
women
who
cant
afford
any
of
those
choices
will
be
forced
to
take
choice
b
or
c
which
will
cost
all
of
us
more
money
most
of
us
dont
see
any
reason
at
all
why
more
money
should
be
spent
to
the
effect
of
removing
personal
choice
from
some
women
the
alternative
is
to
fund
a
if
that
is
what
the
mother
chooses
we
will
also
still
fund
b
and
even
c
if
that
is
what
the
mother
chooses
however
some
women
will
certainly
choose
a
and
that
will
then
save
us
we
otherwise
would
have
had
to
spend
your
taxes
are
not
being
raised
to
fund
a
choice
you
object
they
are
being
lowered
because
we
will
fund
a
choice
that
is
legal
despite
your
objections
to
it
actually
your
taxes
are
not
really
going
to
go
down
as
im
sure
you
would
point
out
but
the
amount
that
is
saved
in
that
area
can
help
out
in
anotherlike
our
massive
debt
if
you
disagree
then
give
us
some
reasons
given
that
abortion
is
legal
and
the
right
to
abortion
is
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
population
it
is
not
justifiable
to
refuse
abortions
to
women
who
can
not
afford
them
who
will
simply
require
even
greater
funds
for
the
delivery
you
would
force
upon
them
i
refuse
to
pay
more
taxes
to
remove
choice
from
those
women
just
because
you
object
to
a
legal
medical
procedure
what
i
say
objection
to
the
procedure
is
irrelevant
uncle
bill
doesnt
pay
for
breast
augmentation
facelifts
etc
why
abortions
its
elective
surgery
those
other
procedures
you
mention
only
cost
money
there
is
no
savings
in
other
procedures
that
would
be
required
down
the
road
without
them
in
fact
there
could
be
additional
costs
down
the
road
because
of
them
this
is
quite
different
from
the
case
of
abortion
as
for
your
argument
you
are
enticing
a
young
girl
to
kill
a
baby
by
making
it
affordable
and
refusing
to
make
the
alternative
affordable
too
so
you
are
just
as
guilty
of
removing
a
choice
by
withholding
funds
think
about
it
a
poor
girl
is
pregnant
and
abortions
are
federally
funded
whats
she
gonna
do
what
choice
have
your
plans
given
her
your
kind
of
double
talk
really
makes
me
ill
this
is
bullshit
we
are
not
refusing
to
make
the
alternative
affordable
too
if
we
refused
to
pay
for
the
more
expensive
choice
of
birth
then
your
statement
would
make
sense
but
that
is
not
the
case
so
it
doesnt
if
clinton
tried
to
block
funding
for
prenatal
care
and
delivery
or
left
it
out
of
his
healthcare
plan
i
would
certainly
object
i
would
also
be
quite
surprised
prochoice
ha
proabortion
really
fits
in
your
case
yes
but
probably
not
your
definition
of
it
or
for
the
reasons
you
think
if
youre
gonna
fund
one
choice
you
have
to
fund
them
all
at
the
very
least
you
stupid
fuck
we
do
want
to
fund
all
the
choices
you
are
the
one
who
wants
to
not
fund
all
the
choices
imho
if
we
fund
the
adoption
choice
right
meaning
not
just
throwing
money
at
it
but
cutting
costs
esp
legal
costs
we
wont
need
abortion
anymore
your
humble
opinion
is
still
wrong
even
with
easy
adoption
there
is
still
the
fact
that
pregnancy
takes
several
months
months
in
which
a
young
woman
could
need
to
be
getting
an
education
like
finishing
high
school
entering
college
finishing
college
getting
a
jobthings
that
are
much
harder
to
do
if
you
have
to
take
a
break
for
a
few
monthsthings
that
have
a
massive
impact
on
her
future
productivity
have
a
right
to
life
a
fetus
is
not
a
person
you
can
not
have

conversation
with

ah
lets

the
mentally
incompetant
as
well
or
how
about
people
we
just
dont
like
since
we
cant
have

you
can
have

with
the
mentally
incompetant
and
even
though
you
personally
may
refuse
to
have
a
conversation
with
people
you
just
dont
like
it
is
still
possible
for
others
to
have
a
conversation
with
them
it
is
not
possible
for
anyone
to
have
a
conversation
with
a
fetus
they
are
not
biologically
independent
nor
was
my
son
at
the
age
of
weeks
he
was
breastfed
and
would
not
take
a
bottle
just
what
does
biologically
independent
mean
ill
be
happy
to
punch
any
definition
full
of
loopholes
he
was
still
biologically
independent
at
least
to
the
same
extent
you
are
now
he
consumed
nutrients
and
digested
them
in
the
normal
manner
he
breathed
his
own
air
a
fetus
on
the
other
hand
gets
its
nutrients
already
digested
by
the
mother
it
gets
its
oxygen
from
the
mother
as
well
that
is
not
biologically
independent
their
awareness
is
questionable
aha
you
admit
it
is
questionable
yet
you
are
willing
to
kill
it
even
if
it
may
be
very
aware
i
suggest
you
rethink
your
viewpoint
awareness
is
only
part
of
what
makes
a
member
of
society
it
is
the
minimal
conceivable
requirement
yet
many
people
seem
to
think
that
something
without
awareness
could
still
be
important
enough
to
justify
the
suffereing
of
a
true
member
of
society
i
keep
asking
but
i
still
havent
seen
a
real
justification
for
why
the
life
of
a
nonsentient
creature
should
be
worth

suffering

what
i
mean
by

is
humptydumpty
taoism
in
which
taoism
means
whatever
a
poster
says
it
means
this
alttaoism
could
also
be
a
refuge
for
debates
about
what
taoism
really
means
or
speculations
on
sexual
alchemy
etc
so
rather
than
debate
what
taoism
really
means
you
are
suggesting
that
we
take
someone
elses
word
for
it
and
work
thusly
id
rather
not
thank
you
whats
happening
is
that
that
the
term
taoism
is
becoming
completely
polluted
and
trivialized
like
the
words
magic
alchemy
zen
etc
by
writers
appropriating
the
word
to
mean
whatever
they
want
this
is
seen
by
the
spate
of
new

books
entitled
the
tao
of
this
that
and
everything
else
whereas
you
of
course
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
the
word
means
can
you
tell
the

any
other
commentsideas
i
look

on

let
misctaoism
rip

let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
wonderful
idea
it
just
gets
filled
up
with
college
freshmen
asking
about
the
tao
of
sex
then
it
will
have
been
a
failure
and
people
will
post
to
these
groups
just
as
they
do
now
only
if
you
choose
to
define
failure
in
that
way
or
to
define
it
at
all
i
believe
in
the
flesh
and
the
appetites
seeing
hearing

he
seems
to
have
risen
to

worshipped
by

associated
with

but
not
the

he
is
the
lord
of
contract
honor
and
obedience
therefore
naturally
worshipped
by
soldiers
he
was
ordered
by
the

to
slay
the

reason
i

but
all
references

ended
abruptly
when
he
was
stricken

apparently
his
worship
was
some
sort
of
vehicle
for
advancement

soldiers
with

they
worshipped
underground
in

in

the
bull
horns
in
those

were
for
scaring
away

im
not

they

not

you
are

then
delete

now
tell
me
that
the
two

say
effectively
the

and
to
save
everyone
a
couple
of
trips
round
this

please
notice
that
we
are
only
obliged
to
use
force
to
preserve
self
we
can
choose
not
to
preserve
self
which
is
the
point
of
pacifism
ok
got
you
i
concede
your
point
though
the
word
obliged
strongly
implies
that
one
must
sometimes
use
force
a
further
rephrasing
would
give
you
the
distinction
you
mention
however
if
i
have
you
right
a
pacifist
would
not
even
go
on
to
say
unfortunatelyetc
would
you
say
this
of
any
two
statements
one
saying
x
is
moral
and
the
other
saying
x
is
immoral
how
would
you
decided
when
two
statements
x
is
moral
x
is
immoral
actually
conflict
and
when
they
say
effectively
the
same
thing
what
they
prescribe
that
one
should
do
is
a
pretty
good
indicator
and
in
this
case
they
dont
prescribe
the
same
things
so
yes
fair
enough
though
why
confuse
things
by
saying
that
one
is
somtimes
obliged
if
the
real
meaning
is
that
one
is
never
obliged
and
lead
one
to
do
precisely
the
same
thing
then
either
both
statements
are
doublespeak
or
none
they
might
lead
you
to
do
the
same
thing
but
the
difference
is
what
motivates
pacifism
so
they
obviously
dont
lead
pacifists
to
to
the
same
thing
thats
not
true
you
could
formulate
a
pragmatic
belief
in
minimum
force
and
still
be
a
pacifist
if
the
minimum
is
great
but
one
is
always
trying
to
get
as
close
to
force
as
possible
under
that
belief
not
the
same
as
force
is
immoral
period
but
still
tending
to
pacifism
if
you
dont
think
the
use
of
force
is
immoral
why
minimise
its
use
if
you
dont
think
that
it
is

would

this
is

complete
nonsense
the

for

is
if
any
class

eric
is

peering

what
they
see
im
talking
about
uninterpreted
facts
observations
people
do
those
agreement
on
some
observations
is
a
prerequisite
for
a
theory
that
is
more
than
personal
yes
thats
true
but
you
have
to
be
clear
exactly
what
is
an
uninterpreted
observation
its
pretty
low
level
stuff
the
sun
shines
is
already
a
lot
higher
level
than
that
we
can
agree
that
i
perceive
brightness
perhaps
now
i
take
an
experience
of
goodevil
to
be
every
bit
as
raw
a
fact
as
an
experience
of
pain
or
vision
that
might
seem
like
a
good
first
pass
guess
but
it
turns
out
to
be
a
pretty
cruddy
way
to
look
at
things
because
we
all
seem
to
have
rather
different
opinions
experiences
about
what
is
good
and
evil
while
we
seem
to
be
able
to
agree
on
what
the
meter
says
youre
not
comparing
apples
with
apples
if
we
all
look
at
the
same
meter
well
agree
if
were
all
in
the
same
situation
thats
when
well
agree
on
fundamental
values
if
at
all
people
who
say
that
nobody
agrees
on
values
to
the
same
extent
that
they
agree
on
trivial
observations
seem
to
be
unaware
of
the
extent
of
agreement
on
either
huh
what
do
you
mean
all
in
the
same
situation
lets
take
me
and
dennis
kriz
as
examples
were
in
pretty
different
situations
but
i
think
we
can
agree
as
to
whether
its
day
or
night
i
dont
think
we
can
agree
as
to
whether
or
not
abortion
is
morally
acceptable
yet
we
are
certainly
in
the
same
difference
of
situations
with
respect
to
each
other
looks
like
weaselwords
to
me
frank
i
dont
see
that
its
any
evidence
at
all
as
i
point
out
above
im
really
not
interested
very
much
in
what
the
popular
opinion
is
im
prepared
to
trustto
some
extent
the
popular
opinion
about
direct
matters
of
physical
observation
because
by
and
large
they
accord
with
my
own
however
if
everyone
else
said
the
dial
read
and
it
looked
like
a
to
me
i
would
hope
that
i
would
believe
myself
ie
believing
other
people
about
these
matters
seems
to
have
a
reasonable
probability
of
predicting
what
i
would
believe
if
i
observed
myself
but
the
possibility
exists
that
it
is
not
since
i
know
from
observation
that
others
disagree
with
me
about
what
is
good
i
believe
i
can
discount
popular
opinion
about
good
from
the
beginning
as
a
predictor
of
my
opinion
i
would
say
that
the
fact
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
to
get
people
to
agree
on
what
is
good
in
a
really
large
number
of
situations
is
probably
the
best
evidence
that
objective
morality
is
bogus
actually
firstly
if
everyone
else
said
the
dial
was
and
i
saw
id
check
my
lens
prescription
thats
up
to
you
i
guess
secondly
your
observation
that
people
disagree
shows
nothing
people
may
be
looking
at
different
things
by
virtue
of
being
in
different
situations
if
i
look
at
an
elephant
ill
see
an
elephant
that
doesnt
imply
that
you
will
see
an
elephant
if
you
look
at
an
iguana
this
different
situations
stuff
is
pretty
confusing
frank
how
do
we
decide
if
we
are
in
the
same
situation
you
mind
explaining
thirdly
i
question
your
assumption
that
when
people
disagree
about
how
to
achieve
fundamental
or
secondary
goals
that
they
therefore
do
not
have
the
same
fundamental
goals
that
seems
to
be
the
disagreement
you
refer
to
huh
i
dont
think
so
i
think
that
people
disagree
about
fundamental

inherently
subjective

can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
i
think
that
if
a
theist
were
truly
objective
and
throws
out
the
notion
that
god
definitely
exists
and
starts
from
scratch
to
prove
to
themselves
that
the
scriptures
are
the
whole
truth
then
that
person
would
no
longer
be
a
theist
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
youre
missing
something
here
there
are
people
who
convert
from
nontheism
to
theism
after
being
brought
up
in
a
nontheist
household
i
dont
have
any
statistics
as
to
how
many
though
that
would
be
an
interesting
thing
to
know
i
think
that
religion
is
a
crutch
people
are
naturally
afraid
of
the
unknown
and
the
unexplainable
people
dont
want
to
believe
that
when
they
die
they
are
dead
finished
that
there
is
nothing
else
after
that
and
so
religion
is
kind
of
a
nice
fantasy
religion
also
describes
things
we
dont
know
about
the
universe
things
science
has
not
yet
described
and
it
also
gives
people
a
feeling
of
security
that
if
they
just
do
this
one
thing
and
everything
will
be
ok
that
they
are
being
watched
over
by
a
higher
power
and
its
minions
this
has
a
very
high
psychological
attraction
for
quite
a
few
people
and
these
people
are
willing
to
put
up
with
a
few
discrepancies
and
holes
in
their
belief
system
for
what
it
gains
them
this
is
why
i
think
its
kind
of
useless
to
try
too
hard
to
convert
theists
to
atheism
they
are
happy
with
their
fantasy
and
they
feel
that
other
people
will
be
happy
with
it
too
they
cant
accept
the
fact
that
there
are
people
who
would
rather
accept
the
harsh
reality
that
they
are
running
from
anyway
im
getting
kind
of
carried
away
here
but
my
point
is
that
theism
doesnt
have
to
be
ingrained
into
a
childs
mindset
for
that
person
to
grow
up
as
a
theist
although
this
happens
far
too
often
theism
is
designed
to
have
its
own
attractions

russell

as

with
the

the

unfortunately
he
seems
to
be
hoping
for

where
it

the

well
be
an

mixing
himself
up

a

also
unfortunately
perhaps
i
have
a

which
prevents
me
in
good
conscience
from
writing
a
more
considered
response
and
fully
entering
the
fray
as
it
were
let
me
then
say
what
i
can
briefly
the
two
commandments
are
rules
they
are
merely
rules
that
are
so
vague
that
they
are
practically
devoid
of
meaning
this
point
for
the
netbrowsers
who
also
still
read
books
is
pursued
throughly
in
kaufmann
critiqueofreligionandphilosophy
the
commandment
to
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
can
be
viewed
in
part
as
reminding
man
that
he
is
not
god
and
cannot
act
as
if
he
has
ultimate
responsibility
this
is
a
theological
statement
worthy
of
barth
dr
turpin
dd
may
wear
the
black
robe
of
geneva
yet
indeed
many
traditions
present
an
interpretation
where
believers
are
supposed
to
interpret
loving
ones
neighbor
as
following
various
other
rules
and
relying
on
their
god
to
make
things
come
out
right
precisely
because
it
would
be
wrong
for
man
to
assume
such
ultimate
responsibility
once
again
we
are
confronted
with
good
sounding
goo
that
means
whatever
the
reader
wants
it
to
mean
this
requires
the
assumption
that
all
interpretations
are
equally
valid
that
there
is
no
way
of
reasonably
distinguishing
among
them
i
wouldnt
make
that
assumption
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reasonable
assumption
and
who
is
to
say
that
this
interpretation
is
twisted
there
are
many
passages
in
the
bible
that
in
their
most
straightforward
reading
show
the
christian
god
behaving
in
just
this
way
michael
and
i
and
others
read
the
bible
with
christian
glasses
among
the
things
that
this
should
imply
is
that
the
nt
informs
the
ot
even
to
the
point
of
dominanting
it
some
points
in
the
ot
ceremonial
dietary
laws
are
explicitly
abrogated
by
the
nt
texts
to
drive
russell
turpins
point
with
adequacy
one
needs
to
begin
with
nt
texts
probably
from
matthew
and
probably
about
damnation
just
trying
to
help
this
part
is
i
discover
what
most
moves
me
to
post
mls
i
am
a
radical
christian
only
in
that
i
take
the

seriously
no
michael
the
conservative
christians
also
take
the

seriously
what
differentiates
you
is
the
way
you
interpret
the

russell

no
here
is
misplaced
not
to

inappropriate
michaels
selfdescription
much
govern
the
equation
of
radical
liberal
which
seems
implied
by
russell
turpin
is
wrong
radical
conservatives
are
possible
if
sadly
lacking
in
numbers
at

thomas
merton
was
a
radical
even
though
conservative
in
some
ways
st
francis
was
a
radical
similarly
how
many
examples
are
needed
mls
why
dont
i
and
the
myriads
of
other
christians
like
me
mls
tell
you
something
about
christianity
michaels
question
gets
to
a
heart
of
the
matter
klingons
have
two
hearts
so
my
metaphor
is
not
mixed
just
extraterrestrial
russell
turpin
in
an
earlier
post
had
said
that
michael
michaels
theological
positions
actually
didnt
tell
him
much
about
christianity
dean
simeon
responds
this
time
gently
what
do
you
mean
more
direct
perhaps
would
have
been
what
could
you
possibly
mean
the
implied
rhetorical
effort
to
separate
michael
from
the
tradition
is
a
failure
michael
is
in
the
tradition
if
your
idea
of
the
tradition
doesnt
include
him
change
your
idea
of
the
tradition
the
irony
here
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
christianity
per
se
that
michael
can
use
to
support
the
cause
of
lesbians
and
gays
how
can
one
answer
this
while
staying
on
the
more
general
issue
im
on
the
other
side
of
the
interpretive
fence
from
michael
on
this
issue
yet
nothing
is
a
hideous
overstatement
one
verse
is
enough
to
refute
it
ill
offer
two
from
paul
of
all
people
in
jesus
christ
there
is
neither
male
nor
femalegalatians
i
dont
quote
single
verses
as
a
rule
and
i
dont
carry
them
in
my
head
and
nothing
shall
separate
us
from
the
glory
of
god
roughly
from
romans
if
russell
would
promise
to
convert
based
on
these
or
any
other
verses
id
promise
to
get
the
full
context
for
any
that
he
requires
in
short
it
is
the
extrachristian
principles
that
make
michaels
christianity
beneficial
and
i
suspect
they
would
be
as
beneficial
perhaps
moreso
without
being
filtered
by
christian
interpretation
this
conclusion
does
not
follow
even
in
short
from
the
argument
that
goes
before
a
surprising
logical
ellipsis

i

the

state
what
is

if
the

are
accurate
what
iyo
does
this
say
about
the
quality

or
are
the
allegations
just
part
of
the
big
coverup
thank
you
steve
it
is
refreshing
to
have
someone
accuse
me
of
being
a
christian
i
only
hope
enough
evidence
can
be
garnered
to
get
a
conviction
i
am
not
certain
what
you
mean
by
the
fundy
part
as
the
term
fundamentalist
has
a
wide
variety
of
uses
if
you
refer
to
those
who
actually
believe
jesus
is
the
messiah
and
son
of
god
and
wish
to
follow
in
his
way
then
i
plead
guilty
but
what
does
it
matter
what
i
think
the
roman
circus
is
over
the
lions
have
been
satisfied
for
now
the
emperor
after
the
long
and
gruelling
struggle
sensed
the
crowd
was
tiring
and
gave
thumbs
down
with
respect
to
my
previous
comments
about
david
koresh
i
urge
you
to
reexamine
my
previous
posts
i
believe
you
mistakenly
assume
that
defense
of
koresh
right
to
his
own
personal
beliefs
and
his
right
to
express
them
to
others
implies
agreement
with
koresh
theology
actually
i
understand
little
about
the
details
of
branch
davidian
teachings
and
regret
so
many
are
hungup
on
that
aspect
of
the
tragic
events
of
the
past
few
days
nor
do
i
think
koresh
sex
life
should
be
of
any
interest
to
the
federal
government
of
course
hillary
says
he
had
been
molesting
infants
so
it
must
be
true
even
though
such
allegations
do
not
fall
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
they
are
state
and
local
matters
and
have
been
thoroughly
reviewed
at
the
local
level
by
proper
authorities
with
no
successful
charge
having
ever
been
levied
against
him
under
american
law
he
was
innocent
as
americans
are
presumed
innocent
until
proven
guilty
at
least
thats
how
it
is
suppposed
to
be
but
he
was
demonized
and
propa
gandized
against
by
a
powerful
machine
to
have
him
appear
as
a
lustful
beast
and
therefore
deserving
of
every
ill
the
fates
might
bring
upon
him
but
evidence
trickles
in
that
the
twentyone
children
who
left
the
building
in
the
early
days
of
the
siege
were
carefully
examined
by
qualified
authorities
for
evidence
of
physical
or
sexual
abuse
and
none
was
found
deguerin
one
of
the
attorneys
who
met
with
davidians
several
times
before
the
conflagration
reported
that
the
children
seemed
well
adjusted
and
showed
no
sign
of
abuse
ultimately
steve
what
i
think
about
the
heart
of
david
koresh
is
quite
unimportant
today
he
is
in
the
benevolent
hands
of
a
most
wise
and
merciful
judge
who
will
one
day
surely
judge
us
all
so
i
withhold
any
judgment
of
david
koresh
and
defer
to
the
one
who
has
all
knowledge
meanwhile
lets
clean
up
the
mess
left
on
earth
and
keep
this
from
happening
again
by
sending
a
strong
message
to
the
government
to
respect
the
inalienable
rights
of
the
people
it
serves
joe

i
remain

neutral

himself

your

does

thorough
investigation

whole

and
ill
be
disappointed
if

heads
dont

takes
part
in
a
secret
ceremony
involving
a

he
stands

coax

they
then

the

is
historical
fiction
and
most
of

there

jesus

never

toleration

toleration
is

the

subject
what
right
recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock

sheep
unable

do
otherwise
that

the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
i
just
want
to

out

lets
start
with
the
name
rosicrucian
i
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
member
of
a
rosicrucian
body
and
being
a
rosicrucian
so
when
you
say
that
you
met
some
rosicrucians
you
mean
members
of
a
group
that
calls
themselves
rosicrucian
at
least
that
is
what
your
observation
suggests
response
this
makes
much
sense
to
me
this
is
also
true
of
most
religions
there
is
a
difference
between
being
a
member
of
a
group
of
people
who
call
themselves
hindus
or
christians
or
pagans
and
actually
being
any
of
these
the
social
groups
tend
to
make
very
important
requirements
about
not
belonging
to
other
religions
i
find
that
the
ideal
described
by
the
holy
texts
of
most
religions
can
be
interpreted
in
very
similar
ways
so
that
one
could
presume
that
mysticism
is
the
core
of
every
religion
and
huxleys
perennial
philosophy
is
the
great
secret
core
of
all
mystical
trads
tony
id
prefer
if
you
would
have
stated
up
front
that
it
was
the
lectorium
rosicrucianum
only
because
they
may
be
confused
by
some
readers
of
this
newsgroup
with
the
rosicrucian
order
amorc
based

in

this
being
the
rc
org
with
the
most

last
time
i
looked
of
course
most

does
not
necessarily
mean
best
response
certainly
true
i
didnt
know
there
were
any
groups
which
called
themselves
rosicrucians
that
didnt
associate
with
amorc
sure
ive
heard
all
the
hubbub
about
the
golden
dawn
and
rosae
crucis
in
relation
to
all
these
western
esoteric
groups
but
hadnt
heard
about
other
rosicrucians
ill
admit
my
bias
i
live

tony
youll
have
to
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
that
lectureclasswhatever
had
been
presented
by
amorc
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
impression
ie
youd
probably
have
had
a
positive
impression
more
likely
than
a
negative
one
imho
response
this
may
be
slightly
off
ive
met
some
of
these
rosicrucians
and
have
a
couple
friends
in
amorc
the
stories
ive
heard
and
the
slight
contact
ive
had
with
them
does
not
give
me
the
hope
that
id
be
received
with
any
kind
of
warm
welcome
i
still
like
to
think
that
most
people
who
are
involved
with
stratified
relationships
monogamy
religion
etc
are
in
deep
pain
and
hope
to
heal
it
within
such
a
cast
tony
it
is
curious
to
know
that
other
rc
orders
in
the
usa
claim
to
be
non
sectarian
response
id
like
to
know
at
least
the
addresses
of
the
other
orders
which
call
themselves
rosicrucians
and
especially
those
which
are
nonsectarian
is
this
nonsectarian
like
the
masons
who
require
that
a
member
believe
in
god
by
hisher
definition
tony
i
dont
see
nothing
fundamentally
wrong
with
us
containing
something
divine
and
yes
i
dont
like

let

orthodox
is

word
it
comes
from
orthos
straight
true
right
and
from
doxa
opinion
doctrine
teaching
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teaching
right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting
god
speak
to
us
through
the
bible
this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
thanks
for
the
etymology
lesson
but
i
actually
know
what
orthodox
means
youre
avoiding
my
question
however
which
was
from
what
body
of
theology
does
your
version
of
orthodoxy
come
you
seem
to
simply
be
saying
that
whatever
you
understand
the
bible
to
say
is
orthodox
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
you
are
obviously
mistaken
since
many
many
people
have
read
the
bible
and
many
do
not
agree
with
you
on
this
point
once
again
robert
is
your
interpretation
the
only
correct
or
orthodox
one
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
ra
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
this
whole
string
began
as
a
response
to
your
attacks
on
mormonism
no
one
is
attacking
your
personal
beliefs
only
your
tendency
to
present
them
as
orthodoxy
i
dont
much
care
what
you
believe
about
the
bible
just
dont
present
you
personal
understanding
as
the
only
orthodox
one
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there
are
other
views
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scripture
and
then
we
can
go
on
i
have
never
attacked
your
specific
beliefs
thats
your
approach
remember
stating
that
other
people
who
depend
solely
on
the
bible
have
other
views
is
indeed
proof
that
the
bible
can
be
interpreted
many
ways
which
has
been
my
whole
point
all
along
the
specifics
of
your
belief
are
your
business
just
dont
pretend
that
they
are
anything
more
than
your
personal
intepretation
and
be
careful
about
crying
heresy
based
on
your
private
belief

in

what

any

the

is
inferior

to
that

i
just

works
in
all
possible

can
provide

move

wont
hold

it
will
hold
in
almost
all
the

likely
to
be

brian

brian

by

if

the

doesnt

even
to

about

that
is
but
one
example
looking
at
your

i
would
say
that
you
both
operate
from
your

frame
theres
no
inside

no
outside
there
are
just
two
polarized
views
as
for

inside

things
are
still
not

clear
we
dont

any
indications
for

why

jobs
is
very
much
out

with
the

theres
a

that
someone
added
this
book
later

does
play
a
big

what

i

shows
that
he
hasnt
he
has
a
narrower
perspective

mine
at

in

respect

i
am
proposing

brian
come
up

take
a

vantage
point

brian

i

the

this
operates
the

around

you

if

it
is
pretty
hard
to

im

they
are

way
to
arrest
a
violent
felon
like
a
bank
robber
if
there
is
no
need
to

they

just
surround

point
out
that

is

furthermore
we
dont
know
of
any
substitute
strategy
capable
of
apprehending
potentially
dangerous
and

do
you
suggest
it
is
not
a
method
to
apprehend
criminals
that
the

always
knock
with
guns
holstered
and
never
arrest
any
suspects
until
they
have
been
allowed
to
inspect

just
what
should
the

do
when
apprehending

how

can
they
reasonably
go
to
identity
themselves
what
do
you
suggest
they
can
do
which
cant
be
faked
by
the
competition
it
is
a
very
dangerous
method
to
obtain
evidence
that
might
be
destroyed
if
a
warrant
is
served
in
the
normal
way
it
is
the
most
dangerous
way
to
arrest
anyone
the
cops
are
charging
into
a
room
and
they
dont
know
what
is
in
it
it
is
much
safer
to
surround
the
place
and
announce
yourself
even
if
youve
got
deadly
enemies
who
may
pretend
to
be
cops
thats
not
an
excuse
to
murder
police
in
the

there
was
almost
definitely
at

the
paranoid
delusion
of
deadly
enimies
who
would
pretend
to
be

cops
are
not
cops
until
they
identify
themselves
as
police
officers
most
drug
dealers
and
professional
criminals
are
aware
of
the
likelihood
of
arrest
but
they
also
know
how
the
system
works
if
they
are
arrested
they
call
their
lawyer
post
bail
and
hope
for
a
plea
bargain
if
they
pull
a
gun
and
shoot
a
cop
during
a

they
will
be
charged
with
first
degree
murder
if
they
survive
the

drug
dealers
have
guns
for
protection
from
their
customers
and
other

an

if

the

the

thing
that

lets
consider
some
personal
interpretations
and
see
how
much
trust
we
should
put
in
orthodox
mormonism
which
could
never
be
confused
with
orthodox
christianity
in
one
of
his
attacks
on
christians
the
mormon
apostle
bruce
r
mcconkie
said
they
thrash
around
indarkness
in
trying
to
identify
elohim
and
jehovah
and
to
show
their
relationship
to
the
promised
messiah
he
also
said
christians
are
wrong
to
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
god
the
father
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only
begotten
son
mcconkie
then
stated
what
mormons
believe
today
to
be
the
truth
about
the
matter
he
said
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
jehovah
is
the
son
being
thus
aware
of
how
far
astray
the
religious
intellectualists
have
gone
in
defining
their
threeinone
god
it
comes
as
no
surprise
to
learn
that
they
thrash
around
in
the
same
darkness
in
trying
to
identify
elohim
and
jehovah
and
to
show
their
relationship
to
the
promised
messiah
some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
came
into
mortality
as
the
only
begotten
as
with
their
concept
that
god
is
a
spirit
this
misinformation
about
the
gods
of
heaven
is
untrue
the
fact
is
and
it
too
is
attested
by
holy
writ
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
who
was
born
into
mortality
as
the
lord

p
notice
that
mcconkie
said
the
christians
are
as
wrong
about
their
threeinone

and
their
belief
that
god
is
a
spirit
as
they
are
in
their
understanding
of
who
elohim

are

examining
mcconkies
attack

its
validity
we

more
statements

concerning
the
words

connotes
his
supremacy
and
omnipotence

mormon
doctrine
p
agreeing
with
mcconkie
on
the
question
of
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
the
apostle
james
e
talmage
stated
elohim
as
understood
and
used
in
the
restored
church
of
jesus
christ
is
the
nametitle
of
god
the

father
whose

son
in

jesus

p
a
doctrinal
exposition
by
the
first
presidency

the
twelve
apostles
of
the
mormon
church
states
that
god
the
eternal

by

christ
in
his
preexistent
antemortal
or
unembodied
statewas
known
as

articles
of
faith
p
today
mormon
leaders
teach
that
elohim
in
the
ot
refers
to
god
the
father
and
jehovah
refers
to
christ
mcconkie
attacked
christians
for
saying
jehovah
can
refer
to
the
father
he
stressed
that
these
two
nametitles
should
not
be
changed
around
so
that
christ
is
called
elohim
and
the
father
is
called
jehovah
the
fatheris
elohim
not
jehovah
jehovah
is
christ
and
christ
is
jehovah
they
are
one
and
the
same
person
promised
messiah
p
in
the
ot
of
the
kjv
of
the
bible
the
hebrew
word
elohim
is
used
to
refer
to
the
true
god
false
gods
and
goddesses
and
the
judges
of
israel
when
referring
to
the
true
god
elohim
is
translated
with
a
capital
g
when
referring
to
false
gods
and
goddesses
and
the
judges
of
israel
it
is
translated
with
a
small
g
it

translated
four
times
as

exod
once
as

twice
as

once
as

ps
once
as
godly
mal
once
as

and
once
as
very
great
sam
the
word
jehovah
is
the
traditional
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
yhwh
or
yhvh
with
the
vowel
points
taken
from
the
word
adonai
many
people
believe
the
true
pronunciation
of
the
tetragrammation
was
yahweh
or
yahveh
however
since
jehovah
rather
than
yahweh
is
the
word
used
by
mormonism
this
section
will
also
use
jehovah
instead
of
yahweh
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
claims
of
mormon
leaders
regarding
that
name
jehovah
unlike
elohim
is
never
used
of
false
gods
it
is
the
personal
name
of
the
triune
god
of
the
bible
in
the
kjv
jehovah
is
rendered
primarily
lord
sometimes
god
and
rarely
lord
now
that
we
understand
something
about
the
words
elohim
and
jehovah
and
their
use
by
mormon
leaders
we
shall
consider
the
apostle
mcconkies
attack
on
christians
for
believing
the
father
is
jehovah
in
trying
to
prove
that
jehovah
refers
exclusively
to
christ
mcconkie
cited
several
verses
from
the
bible
some
of
these
verses
and
mcconkies
interpretation
of
them
will
be
examined
to
see
whether
he
was
right
remember
mcconkie
said
the
father
is
not
jehovah
he
is
only
elohim
the
first
example
we
shall
consider
involves
mcconkies
interpretation
of
ps
of
this
verse
he
stated
of
whom
spake
david
when
his
tongue
was
touched
by
the
holy
spirit
and
he
testified
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
two
lords
are
here
involved
one
is
speaking
to
the
other
one
is
greater
than
the
other
one
is
making
provision
for
the
triumph
and
glory
of
the
other
who
are
they
and
what
message
is
contained
in
this
messianic
prophecy
what
think
ye
of
christ
our
lord
asked
certain
of
his
detractors
toward
the
end
of
his
mortal
ministry
whose
son
is
he
is
christ
the
son
of
god
or
of
someone
else
is
he
to
be
born
of
a
divine
parent
or
will
he
be
as
other
men
a
mortal
son
of
a
mortal
father
that
he
was
to
be
a
descendant
of
david
was
a
matter
of
great
pride
to
all
the
jews
and
so
they
answered
the
son
of
david
davids
son
truly
he
was
but
he
was
more
much
more
and
so
our
lord
with
irrefutable
logic
and
to
their
complete
discomfiture
asked
how
then
doth
david
in
spirit
call
him
lord
saying
the
lord
said
unto
my
lord
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
if
david
then
call
him
lord
how
is
he
his
son
that
is
if
he
is
only
the
son
of
david
how
is
it
that
the
great
king
acting
under
inspiration
calls
him
lord
and
worships
him
as
such
and
we
might
add
who
is
the
other
lord
the
one
who
spake
unto
davids
lord
can
there
be
any
question
as
to
how
jesus
is
interpreting
the
words
of
the
psalm
he
is
saying
that
it
means
the
father
said
unto
the
son
elohim
said
unto
jehovah
sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
until
after
your
mortal
ministry
then
i
will
raise
you
up
to
eternal
glory
and
exaltation
with
me
where
you
will
continue
to
sit
on
my
right
hand
forever
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
agreeing
with
the
above
statement
by
mcconkie
the
following
remark
in
the
mormon
pamphlet
what
the
mormons
think
of
christ
p
reads
the
lord
elohim
the
father
said
unto
my
lord
jehovah
the
son
brackets
in
original
mcconkie
clearly
stated
that
it
is
elohim
the
father
who
is
speaking
to
jehovah
the
son
in
this
psalm
however
when
one
looks
at
the
hebrew
word
translated
lord
it
becomes
apparent
that
either
the
first
lord
is
not
the
father
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
either
way
mcconkie
is
wrong
the
psalm
reads
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
my
lord
adon
sit
thou
at
my
right
hand
until
i
make
thine
enemies
thy
footstool
ps
the
first
lord
in
this
verse
is
jehovah
who
mormonism
says
is
christ
not
the
father
the
second
lord
is
the
hebrew
word
adon
singular
for
adonai
meaning
master
or
lord
if
the
first
lord
is
the
father
and
the
second
lord
is
the
son
then
the
father
is
jehovah
and
the
son
is
adon
however
if
the
father
is
not
jehovah
as
mcconkie
claimed
then
the
first
lord
is
jehovah
the
son
but
who
then
is
adon
obviously
the
father
is
jehovah
in
this
psalm
and
his
son
is
adon
another
example
involves
isa
about
which
mcconkie
stated
the
following
i
the
lord
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
isaiah
quoted
the
father
as
saying
of
christ
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
said
the
father
was
speaking
of
christ
in
this
passage
which
reads
i
the
lord
jehovah
have
called
thee
in
righteousness
and
will
hold
thine
hand
and
will
keep
thee
and
give
thee
for
a
covenant
of
the
people
for
a
light
of
the
gentiles
isa
according
to
mcconkie
i
the
lord
refers
to
the
father
and
thine
and
thee
refer
to
christ
however
the
lord
who
is
speaking
is
jehovah
which
means
either
mcconkie
was
wrong
about
who
is
speaking
or
else
the
father
is
jehovah
another
example
involves
ps
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
same
psalm
says
all
they
that
see
me
laugh
me
to
scorn
they
shoot
out
the
lip
they
shake
the
head
saying
he
trusted
on
the
lord
that
he
would
deliver
him
let
him
deliver
him
seeing
he
delighted
in
him
ps
the
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
is
found
in
these
words
the
chief
priests
mocking
him
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said
he
saved
others
himself
he
cannot
save
if
he
be
the
king
of
israel
let
him
now
come
down
from
the
cross

mcconkie
said
these
verses
had
their
fulfillment
as
jesus
hung
on
the
cross
that
means
the
person
who
was
scorned
in
these
verses
was
christ
who
then
was
the
lord
in
whom
he
trusted
it
was
jehovah
the
father
another
example
involves
ps
and
ps
regarding
them
mcconkie
stated
the
following
with
reference
to
the
conniving
and
conspiring
plots
incident
to
our
lords
arrest
and
judicial
trials
the
prophecy
was
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
ps
as
to
the
role
of
judas
in
those
conspiracies
the
psalmist
says
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
ps
promised
messiah
p
apostle
mcconkie
said
these
psalms
refer
to
christs
arrest
and
judicial
trials
we
shall
first
consider
ps
and
then
ps
while
mcconkie
only
quoted
verse
of
ps
verse
will
also
be
included
to
give
a
complete
understanding
of
the
matter
for
i
have
heard
the
slander
of
many
fear
was
on
every
side
while
they
took
counsel
together
against
me
they
devised
to
take
away
my
life
but
i
trusted
in
thee
o
lord
jehovah
i
said
thou
art
my
god
elohim
ps
mcconkie
said
verse
referred
to
jesus
christ
verse
goes
on
to
tell
that
he
christ
trusted
in
the
lord
who
is
called
his
god
or
elohim
mormonism
teaches
that
the
god
above
jesus
is
elohim
the
father
verse
however
reveals
that
the
elohim
of
the
man
jesus
is
jehovah
the
father
in
ps
mcconkie
only
quoted
one
verse
however
two
verses
will
be
considered
in
this
examination
yea
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
which
did
eat
of
my
bread
hath
lifted
up
his
heel
against
me
but
thou
o
lord
jehovah
be
merciful
unto
me
and
raise
me
up
that
i
may
requite
them
ps
mcconkie
stated
above
that
verse
referred
to
judas
role
in
christs
death
since
it
was
judas
who
was
the
familiar
friend
who
lifted
up
his
heel
the
pronouns
mine
i
my
and
me
in
verse
must
refer
to
christ
notice
that
at
the
beginning
of
verse
there
is
a
change
of
pronoun
to
thou
which
refers
to
the
lord
jehovah
then
the
pronouns
me
and
i
which
refer
to
christ
are
used
again
that
means
christ
was
speaking
to
jehovah
the
father
in
these
verses
another
example
involves
mcconkies
following
remark
about
ps
one
of
the
great
messianic
prophecies
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
david
says
the
lord
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
admitted
this
is
a
messianic
prophecy
involving
christ
the
question
is
what
in
this
verse
refers
to
christ
the
lord
jehovah
hath
sworn
and
will
not
repent
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
ps
does
the
lord
which
is
jehovah
refer
to
christ
if
mcconkie
is
right
and
jesus
is
jehovah
but
the
father
is
not
then
the
lord
would
have
to
refer
to
christ
but
who
then
is
the
one
addressed
as
the
priest
forever
after
the
order
of
melchizedek
the
bible
reveals
that
the
one
referred
to
is
jesus
christ
heb
therefore
the
lord
jehovah
in
ps
is
the
father
another
example
involves
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
of
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
isaiah
said
the
lord
has
laid
on
him
the
iniquities
of
us
all
it
pleased
the
lord
to
bruise
him
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
mcconkie
rightly
said
these
verses
refer
to
the
atoning
sacrifice
of
the
future
messiah
however
what
he
failed
to
mention
is
that
they
also
prove
that
the
father
is
jehovah
verse
reads
all
we
like
sheep
have
gone
astray
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
and
the
lord
jehovah
hath
laid
on
him
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
verse
reads
yet
it
pleased
the
lord
jehovah
to
bruise
him
christ
obviously
the
lord
who
laid
on
christ
the
iniquity
of
us
all
and
who
bruised
him
is
god
the
father
who
is
called
jehovah
in
these
verses
remember
mcconkie
stated
that
some
sectarians
even
believe
that
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
and
that
christ
came
into
mortality
as
his
only
begotten
son
he
called
this
concept
misinformation
that
is
untrue
to
prove
that
it
is
mcconkie
who
is
misinformed
and
believing
untruth
two
scriptural
references
sam
ps
will
be
examined
mcconkie
stated
the
following
regarding
these
scriptures
in
the
midst
of
a
passage
that
is
clearly
messianic
the
lord
says
of
the
seed
of
david
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
sam
in
the
second
psalm
the
whole
of
which
is
also
clearly
messianic
occurs
this
statement
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ps
paul
quotes
both
of
these
statements
in
hebrews
and
says
they
are
prophecies
that
christ
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
cited
heb
to
show
that
sam
and
ps
refer
to
christ
who
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
since
mcconkie
first
referenced
sam
this
examination
will
too
however
along
with
verse
verses
will
also
be
included
and
as
since
the
time
that
i
commanded
judges
to
be
over
my
people
israel
and
have
caused
thee
to
rest
from
all
thine
enemies
also
the
lord
jehovah
telleth
thee
that
he
will
make
thee
an
house
and
when
thy
days
be
fulfilled
and
thou
shalt
sleep
with
thy
fathers
i
will
set
up
thy
seed
after
thee
which
shall
proceed
out
of
thy
bowels
and
i
will
establish
his
kingdom
he
shall
build
an
house
for
my
name
and
i
will
stablish
the
throne
of
his
kingdom
for
ever
i
will
be
his
father
and
he
shall
be
my
son
sam
these
verses
teach
that
the
lord
jehovah
would
have
a
son
the
messiah
in
the
second
example
mcconkie
cited
ps
this
examination
will
include
verse
notice
that
it
is
the
lord
jehovah
who
says
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
i
will
declare
the
decree
the
lord
jehovah
hath
said
unto
me
thou
art
my
son
this
day
have
i
begotten
thee
ask
of
me
and
i
shall
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
for
thy
possession
mcconkie
said
these
verses
of
scripture
are
clearly
messianic
and
he
acknowledged
they
teach
that
christ
would
come
as
the
son
of
god
what
he
is
not
willing
to
acknowledge
however
is
that
these
scriptures
also
teach
that
the
father
is
jehovah
and
that
the
sectarians
who
believe
jehovah
is
the
supreme
deity
whose
son
is
jesus
christ
the
only
begotten
are
right
in
their
belief
another
example
involves
mic
of
this
verse
mcconkie
stated
the
following
and
so
truly
did
our
lord
act
during
his
mortal
ministry
truly
this
is
he
of
whom
it
is
written
he
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
his
god
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
mic
promised
messiah
p
emphasis
added
according
to
mcconkie
the
pronoun
he
at
the
beginning
of
mic
refers
to
christ
during
his
mortal
ministry
who
then
is
the
lord
his
god
mic
reads
and
he
christ
shall
stand
and
feed
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
jehovah
in
the
majesty
of
the
name
of
the
lord
jehovah
his
god
elohim
for
now
shall
he
be
great
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
obviously
the
lord
of
jesus
christ
is
jehovah
the
father
who
is
referred
to
as
jehovah
his
elohim
another
example
involves
ps
and
isa
of
these
verses
mcconkie
stated
the
following
a
number
of
messianic
passages
speak
of
the
lord
andhis
anointed
ps
signifying
that
the
chosen
one
was
consecrated
and
set
apart
for
the
ministry
and
mission
that
was
his
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
by
quoting
isaiahs
prophecy
the
lord
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
isa
and
then
saying
this
day
is
this
scripture
fulfilled
in
your
ears
luke
promised
messiah
pp
emphasis
added
the
first
source
mcconkie
quoted
ps
reads
as
follows
the
kings
of
the
earth
set
themselves
and
the
rulers
take
counsel
together
against
the
lord
jehovah
and
against
his
anointed
mcconkie
said
the
anointed
one
was
christ
if
that
is
true
who
was
jehovah
if
jehovah
is
always
christ
who
was
the
anointed
one
obviously
jehovah
is
referring
to
god
the
father
and
the
anointed
is
indeed
referring
to
christ
the
second
source
mcconkie
cited
is
isa
which
states
the
spirit
of
the
lord
adonai
god
jehovah
is
upon
me
because
the
lord
jehovah
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
good
tidings
unto
the
meek
he
hath
sent
me
to
bind
up
the
brokenhearted
to
proclaim
liberty
to
the
captives
and
the
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
are
bound
the
one
who
was
anointed
to
preach
bind
up
proclaim
and
open
was
jesus
christ
who
then
was
the
one
who
anointed
him
this
verse
says
the
lord
jehovah
did
the
anointing
again
we
face
the
same
problem
if
jehovah
does
not
refer
to
the
father
but
only
to
christ
then
jesus
anointed
someone
but
who
as
mcconkie
pointed
out
jesus
applied
these
passages
to
himself
therefore
the
jehovah
who
anointed
christ
is
god
the
father
other
examples
could
be
cited
to
show
that
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
are
wrong
when
they
say
god
the
father
is
not
jehovah
however
these
should
be
enough
to
expose
their
error
now
what
about
mormonisms
claim
that
jesus
is
jehovah
but
he
is
not
elohim
it
is
true
that
jesus
is
jehovah
the
following
scriptures
prove
this
fact
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
the
king
of
israel
and
his
redeemer
the
lord
jehovah

right
when

the
bible
reveals
that
jehovah
is
the
only
true
elohim
there

jehovah
is
the
personal

triune

biblical
quotes

separate
gods
as
mormons

let
us
first
note
that
not

are
both
god

mormon
error

that

the
literal
parent

jehovahchristdid

life
on

thereof
but
when
it
came
to
placing
man
on

there
was
a
change
in
creators
that
is
the
father
himself
became
personally
involved
all
things
were
created
by
the
son
using
the
power
delegated
by
the
father

man
in

again
in

mormon

mans

they
maintain
that
the
mormon
elohim

another

no
alleged
preexistent

the
mormon
elohim
the
apostle
mcconkie
stated
elohim
plural
word
though
it
is
is
also
used
as
the
exalted
nametitle
of
god
the
eternal

a
usage
that
connotes
his
supremacy
and
omnipotence
he
being
god
above
all
gods
mormon
doctrine
p
he
also
stated
that
jesusis
above
all
save
the
father
only
promised
messiah
p
the
bible
states
that
the
one
who
is
god
above
all
socalled
gods
is
the
triune
god
jehovah
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
a
great
god

a
great
king
above
all

for
thou
lord
jehovah
art
high
above
all

thou
art
exalted
far
above
all

now
i
know
that
the
lord
jehovah
is
greater
than
all
gods
elohim
exod
see
also
ps
deut
if
mormon
leaders
are
right
when
they
say
jehovah
is
god
the
son
and
elohim
is
god
the
father
these
verses
from
the
bible
would
be
teaching
that
the
mormon
son
is
above
his
father
however
as
mcconkie
clearly
stated
mormons
believe
elohim
the
father
not
jehovah
the
son
is
the
god
above
all
gods
that
jesus
is
above
all
except
the
father
yet
the
bible
teaches
that
jehovah
is
above
all
elohim
at
a
byu
dev
on
march
bruce
r
mcconkie
made
the
following
remark
about
praying
to
jesus
another
peril
is
that
those
so
involved
often
begin
to
pray
directly
to
christ
because
of
some
special
friendship
they
feel
has
been
developed
this
is
plain
sectarian
nonsense
our
prayers
are
addressed
to
the
father
and
to
him
only
perfect
prayer
is
addressed
to
the
father
in
the
name
of
the
son
it
is
uttered
by
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
our
relationship
with
the
lord
pp
mcconkie
states
on
p
of
his
book
promised
messiah
that
the
mormons
pray
to
the
father
not
the
son
on
p
of
the
same
book
mcconkie
states
that
christ
the
son
is
jehovah
this
is
important
to
remember
because
although
mcconkie
said
prayer
is
not
to
be
offered
to
the
mormon
christ
who
is
jehovah
the
bible
states
repeatedly
in
the
ot
that
people
prayed
to
jehovah
and
he
not
only
heard
those
prayers
but
he
accepted
them
as
valid
requests
the
following
is
but
a
small
sample
of
the
vast
number
of
times
people
prayed
to
jehovah
in
my
distress
i
called
upon
the
lord
jehovah
and
cried
unto
my
god
elohim
he
heard
my
voice
out
of
his
temple
and
my
cry
came
before
him
even
into
his
ears
ps
and
the
lord
jehovah
said
unto
him
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
that
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
which
thou
hast
built
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
mine
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
kin
and
said
unto
jeremiah
the
prophet
let
we
beseech
thee
our
supplication
be
accepted
before
thee
and
pray
for
us
unto
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
even
for
all
this
remnant
jer
o
lord
jehovah
i
beseech
thee
let
now
thine
ear
be
attentive
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
to
the
prayer
of
thy
servants
who
desire
to
fear
thy
name
neh
and
it
was
so
that
when
solomon
had
made
an
end
of
praying
all
this
prayer
and
supplication
unto
the
lord
jehovah
he
arose
from
before
the
altar
of
the
lord
jehovah
from
kneeling
on
his
knees
with
his
hands
spread
up
to
heaven
kin
he
went
in
therefore
and
shut
the
door
upon
them
twain
and
prayed
unto
the
lord
jehovah
kin
go
and
say
to
hezekiah
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
the
god
elohim
of
david
thy
father
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i

seen
thy
tears

fifteen
years

acknowledge
my
sin
unto

mine
iniquity

i
not
hid

said
i
will
confess
my
transgressions
unto
the
lord
jehovah
and
thou
forgavest
the
iniquity
of
my
sin
for
this
shall
every
one
that
is
godly
pray
unto
thee
in
a
time
when
thou
mayest
be
found
ps
notice
above
in
ps
that
the
godly
pray
to
jehovah
according
to
mcconkie
and
other
mormon
leaders
that
is
christ
the
very
one
to
whom
mcconkie
said
people
should
not
pray
the
bible
reveals
there
is
only
one
true
elohim
and
his
name
is
jehovah
all
other
elohim
are
false
they
are
idols
that
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
the
true
elohim
and
idolatry
for
the
lord
jehovah
is
great
and
greatly
to
be
praised
he
is
to
be
feared
above
all
gods
elohim
for
all
the
gods
elohim
of
the
nations
are
idols
but
the
lord
jehovah
made
the
heavens
ps
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
elohim
before
me
exod
now
i
know
that
the
lord
jehovah
is
greater
than
all

it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim

walk
after
other
gods
elohim

serve
them

i
testify
against
you
this

ye
shall

perish

thou
shalt
make
no
covenant

them

with

make
thee
sin
against
me
for
if
thou
serve
their
gods
elohim
it
will
surely
be
a
snare
unto
thee
exod
take
heed
to
yourselves
that
your
heart
be
not
deceived
and
ye
turn
aside
and
serve
other

worship
them
deut
that
ye
come
not

nations
these
that
remain
among
you
neither
make
mention

them
neither
serve
them
nor
bow
yourselves
unto

josh
neither

your
hurt

the
lord
jehovah
is
the
true
god
elohim
he
is
the
living
god
elohim

and
they
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
god
elohim
of
their
fathers
which
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
elohim
of
the
gods
elohim
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
and
bowed
themselves
unto
them
and
provoked
the
lord
jehovah
to
anger
jud
shall
a
man
make
gods
elohim
unto
himself
and
they
are
no
gods
elohim
therefore
behold
i
will
this
once
cause
them
to
know
i
will
cause
them
to
know
mine
hand

my
might
and
they
shall
know

if
it
seem
evil
unto
you
to
serve
the

choose
you
this
day

ye
will
serve

the

elohim

and

elohim

that
we
should
forsake
the

josh
these
verses
teach
that
the
only
true
living
elohim
in
heaven
and
on
earth
is
jehovah
the
triune
god
who
made
heaven
and
earth
and
all
therein
jehovah
is
greater
than
any
elohim
because
all
other
elohim
are
idols
the
reality
behind
them
is
demonic
deut
jehovah
elohim
has
given
explicit
warnings
and
guidelines
regarding
these
false
elohim
he
told
his
people
not
to
have
any
elohim
but
him
he
told
the
people
that
if
they
left
him
for
the
false
elohim
those
elohim
would
be
a
snare
to
them
and
they
would
be
hurt
and
would
perish
he
warned
the
people
to
take
heed
that
their
heart
be
not
deceived
into
worshiping
serving
swearing
by
and
making
covenants
with
false
elohim
jehovah
elohim
told
his
people
he
would
eventually
judge
all
false
elohim
and
their
followers
despite
these
warnings
and
guidelines
elohims
covenant
people
forsook
him
and
believed
in
and
worshiped
the
false
elohims
of
the
people
they
came
in
contact
with
ju
states
that
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
again
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
baalim
and
ashtaroth
and
the
gods
elohim
of
syria
and
the
gods
elohim
of
zidon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
moab
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
children
of
ammon
and
the
gods
elohim
of
the
philistines
and
forsook
the
lord
jehovah
and
served
not
him
this
examination
has
shown
that
the
elohim
of
mormonism
like
the
elohim
in
ju
is
not
the
true
jehovah
elohim
therefore
the
people
who
leave
the
true
elohim
for
the
mormon
elohim
will
do
evilin
the
sight
of
the
lord
jehovah
although
mcconkie
attacked
christians
for
their
belief
in
a
triune
god
who
is
spirit
and
for
their
belief
that
god
the
father
jehovah
sent
his
son
into
the
world
these
beliefs
are
true
god
is
triune
he
is
spirit
he
is
jehovah
and
he
did
send
his
son
into
the
world
to
redeem
mankind
it
is
obvious
from
this
examination
that
it
is
not
the
christians
who
thrash
around
indarkness
about
who
elohim
and
jehovah
are
one
wonders
what
holy
writ
mcconkie
had
in
mind
when
he
stated
that
it
attests
to
the
fact
that
elohim
is
the
father
and
that
jehovah
is
the
son
he
certainly
did
not
mean
the
bible
which
teaches
that
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
are
all
the
one
jehovah
elohim
he
apparently
did
not
mean
the
dc
either
because
chapter
verses
refer
to
the
father
as
jehovah
summary
obviously
joseph
fielding
smiths
statement
that
the
mormons
have
a
clear
and
perfect
understanding
of
the
nature
of
god
doctrines
of
salvation
is
not
accurate
the
mormon
gods
are
not
the
true
god
as
mormonism
claims
but
are
idols
which
cause
their
followers
to
commit
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
in
answer
to
jesus
question
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
mormons
say
jesus
is
someone
different
from
the
jesus
who
is
revealed
in
the
bible
and
whom
the
apostles
preached
therefore
anyone
trusting
in
the
mormon
jesus
is
believing
in
another
jesus
whom
paul
warned
about
bernard
p
brockbank
of
the
first
quorum
of
the
seventy
admitted
in
the
may
issue
of
the
ensign
a
mormon
publication
that
the
mormon
jesus
is
different
from
the
christian
jesus
he
stated
that
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
christian
churches
worship
a
different
jesus
christ
than
is
worshipped
by
the
mormons
or
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latterday
saints
p
the
people
who
believe
in
the
mormon
jesus
are
committing
adultery
against
god
and
idolatry
they
do
not
have
the
son
therefore
they
do
not
have
the
father
and
they
do
not
have
eternal
life
as
the
apostle
bruce
r
mcconkie
rightly
stated
salvation
comes
only
by
worshiping
the
true
god
promised
messiah
p
mcconkie
also
rightly
stated
that
the
mere
worship
of
a
god
who
has
the
proper
scriptural
names
does
not
assure
one
that
he
is
worshiping
the
true
and
living
god
because
the
true
names
of
deity
can
be
applied
to
false
concepts
of
god
mormon
doctrine
p
remember
that
the
apostle
stephen
l
richards
admitted
that
joseph
smith
jr
gave
a
new
conception
of
god
and
the
godhead
contributions
of
joseph
smith
p
it
is
important
for
the
people
who
have
left
the
true
triune
god
revealed
in
the
bible
to
repent
and
return
to
him
they
must
forsake
the
sins
of
idolatry
and
adultery
which
they
are
committing
in
mormonism
the
bible
says
all
that
forsake
thee
shall
be
ashamed
and
they
that
depart
from
me
shall
be
written
in
the
earth
because
they
have
forsaken
the
lord
jehovah
the
fountain
of
living
waters
jer
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
do
at
all
forget
the
lord
jehovah
thy
god
elohim
and
walk
after
other

elohim
and
serve
them
and

them
i

they

the

belong

but
the
source
document
for
christianity
the
bible
simply
assumes
god
exists
and
makes
it
clear
to
us
calvinists
anyway
that
when
a
person
is
in
fellowship
with
god
it
is
because
god
has
taken
the
initiative
in
revealing
himself
to
that
person
so
from
a
christian
point
of
view
the
burden
of
proof
belongs
to
god
bill
is
being
consistent
with
what
the
bible
teaches
in
relating
his
own
experience
with
god
but
it
would
be
an
error
on
his
part
to
assume
that
there
is
a
direct
causal
relationship
between
his
testimony
and
someone
else
becoming
convinced
that
god
exists
and
that
he
needs
to
be
reconciled
to
god

im
not
sure
that
you
can
distinguish
between
myth
and
legend
so
neatly
or
at
all
a
myth
is
more
than
a
single
story
the
thought
structure
and
worldparadigm
in
which
that
story
is
interpreted
is
as
important
a
part
of
the
myth
as
the
story
itself
thus
i
can
think
of
no
story
which
is
meant
to
be
conveyed
understandably
from
one
person
to
another
within
a
single
culture
which
wont
rest
upon
that
underlying
thought
structure
and
thus
transmit
some
of
that
cultures
mythical
truths
along
with
it
randy
subject
re
davidians
and
compassion
surely
you
are
not
equating
david
koresh
with
christianity
the
two
are
not
comparable
this
is
always
an
option
when
the
sect
is
causing
harm
relabel
the
cult
to
something
else

one

the

claimed
that
they
believed
he
had
automatic
weapons
on
the
premises
he
had
a
license
for
the
caliber
machine
gun
they
knew
damn
well
he
had
one
they
also
knew
he
had
it
legally
still
without
the
element
of
surprise
they
sent
in
agents
to
get
him
for
all
of
this
my
president
takes
full
responsibility
what
a
guy
i
hope
he
gets
it
the
gun
was
a
semiauto
and
was
thus
legal
the
batf
claims
that
the
davidians
also
possessed
illegally
modified
and
illegal
explosives

recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
this
is
not
sarcasm
i
mean
it
how
should
one
deal
with
a
man
who
is
convinced
that
he
is
acting
according
to

will

these
are
two
conflicting
statements

the

is
a
breach
of
logic
i
dont
mind
people
shifting
their
position
on
an
issue
it
irritates
me
when
it
is
said
under
the
premise
that
no
change
was
made
what
about
deuteronomy
is
it
wrong
now
did
jesus
change
that
if
anything
he
clarified
the
law
such
as
in
that
quote
you
made
in
the
following
verses
jesus
takes
several
portions
of
the
law
and
expounds
upon
the
law
giving
clearer
meaning
to
what
god
intended
sure
he
does
this
however
he
doesnt
address
the
notion
of
stoning
nonvirgin
brides
because
this
needs
no
clarification
are
you
going
to
deny
that
deuteronomy
is
not
patently
clear
in
its
intent
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at
or
at
least
i
think
i
do
correct
me
if
i
am
mistaken
but
i
think
you
are
asking
me
if
i
still
believe
that
we
should
uphold
all
of
the
laws
pertaining
to
capital
punishment
for
such
things
as
adultery
rape
and
other
heinous
crimes
as
you
may
recall
jesus
was
confronted
by
this
same
question
in
regards
to
the
adultress
who
was
caught
in
the
act
and
brought
before
jesus
and
his
reply
let
he
who
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
jesus
does
not
deny
the
sentence
that
is
to
due
for
this
violation
of
the
law
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
there
are
in
todays
world
a
lot
of
modernday
pharisees
who
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
but
do
not
believe
in
it
what
good
is
head
knowledge
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
heart
ill
agree
that
there
is
a
lot
of
modern
day
pharisees
that
know
the
bible
from
end
to
end
and
dont
believe
in
it
depending
on
how
they
use
this
knowledge
they
can
be
scary
they
can
argue
any
position
they
desire
and
back
it
up
with
selected
parts
of
the
bible
such
pharisees
include
david
koresh
and
adolph
hitler
i
will
qualify
this
by
saying
i
dont
know
if
they
actually
believed
what
they
were
preaching
but
the
ends
certainly
made
the
means
look
frightening
agreed
however
just
as
scary
are
those
that
dont
know
much
of
the
bible
but
believe
every
word
in
fact
this
is
probably
scarier
since
there
are
far
more
of
these
people
from
what
ive
seen
in
addition
they
are
very
easy
to
manipulate
by
the
aforementioned
pharisees
since
they
dont
know
enough
to
debate
with
these
people
agreed
also
if
one
is
to
use
the
bible
as
a
reference
one
must
always
be
open
to
different
interpretations
as
a
christian
i
have
the
spirit
of
god
to
verify
what
i
believe
in
the
word
if
what
the
spirit
tells
me
is
not
backed
up
in
scripture
then
the
spirit
i
am
communicating
with
is
not
of
god
after
all
jesus
tells
us
to
test
the
spirits
to
know
for
sure
that
it
is
from
god
christianity
is
not
just
a
set
of
rules
its
a
lifestyle
that
changes
ones
perspectives
and
personal
conduct
and
it
demands
obedience
to
gods
will
no
it
demands
obedience
to
a
book
if
god
came
down
and
personally
told
me
how
i
should
behave
then
i
would
say
that
i
would
be
doing
gods
will
by
doing
it
however
if
preachers
pastors
and
evangelists
tell
me
to
obey
the
will
of
a
book
written
by
people
who
have
been
dead
for
close
to
two
millenia
even
longer
for
the
ot
even
if
i
follow
everything
in
it
with
my
heart
i
could
scarcely
be
honest
with
myself
by
saying
im
doing
the
will
of
god
i
obey
what
the
spirit
of
god
tells
me
to
do
the
spirit
will
not
violate
anything
that
is
written
in
the
bible
because
that
is
the
word
of
god
i
do
not
worship
pastors
preachers
my
wife
my
mother
or
my
father
what
they
tell
me
does
not
carry
the
weight
of
what
god
tells
me
to
do
and
his
commands
are
rienforced
in
the
bible
some
people
can
live
by
it
but
many
others
cannot
or
will
not
that
is
their
choice
and
i
have
to
respect
it
because
god
respects
it
too
well
if
god
respects
it
so
much
how
come
there
is
talk
in
the
bible
about
eternal
damnation
for
nonbelievers
i
see
little
respect
eminating
from
the
god
of
the
bible
i
see
a
selfish
and
spiteful
god
eternal
damnation
is
the
consequence
of
the
choice
one
makes
in
rejecting
god
if
you
choose
to
jump
off
a
cliff
you
can
hardly
blame
god
for
you
going
splat
at
the
bottom
he
knows
that
if
you
choose
to
jump
that
you
will
die
but
he
will
not
prevent
you
from
making
that
choice
in
fact
he
sent
his
son
to
stand
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
tell
everyone
of
what
lies
below
to
prove
that
point
jesus
took
that
plunge
himself
but
he
being
god
was
able
to
rise
up
again
i
have
seen
the
example
of
christ
and
have
chosen
not
to
jump
and
im
trying
to
tell
you
not
to
jump
or
else
youll
go
splat
you
dont
have
to
listen
to
me
and
i
wont
stop
you
if
you
decide
to
jump
i
only
ask
that
you
check
it
out
before
taking
the
plunge
you
owe
it
to
yourself
i
dont
like

anyone

one
interpretation
of
the
subatomic
particlewave
duality
is
that
what
we
perceive
as
a
wave
is
actually
an
infinate
number
of
parallel
universes
overlaid
and
in
each
of
these
universes
there
is
a
particle
in
a
different
location
when
we
do
something
to
make
a
particle
appear
we
are
actually
causing
all
the
parallel
universes
to
collapse
into
one
apparently
this
is
one
line
of
thought
on
the
nature
of
qm
that
is
going
through
some
of
the
scientific
community
dr
wolf
and
many
others
claim
that
somehow
the
collapse
is
caused
by
the
mental
effort
of
observing
the
particle
this
implys
that
mind
is
more
than
merely
a
biological
phenomenon
he
then
extrapolates
that
if
mind
is
an
integral
part
of
the
universe
then
perhaps
consciousness
is
the
element
that
gives
order
and
form
to
the
universes
itthemselfs
it
all
gets
rather
interesting
but
what
i
find
facinating
is
that
this
would
explain
the
phenomenon
of
magick
as
practiced
in
my
religion
dr
wolf
speculates
that
the
ordering
functionality
of
mind
could
be
caused
by
the
selection
of
a
future
from
an
infinite
number
of
possible
futures
he
says
that
this
might
be
done
by
some
sort
of
communication
between
ones
current
and
possible
future
selves
i
have
long
speculated
that
if
magick
is
not
merely
a
form
of
self
delusion
then
perhaps
it
could
be
caused
by
some
sort
of
a
selection
of
one
of
many
possible
futures
i
realize
that
this
gets
pretty
bizarre
but
it
never
hurts
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
at
least
file
it
all
away
as
another
possibile
explaination
of
the
world
in
which
we
find
ourselves
after
all
the
more
we
learn
about
the
universe
in
which
we
live
the
more
we
learn
that
it
is
truly
a
very
strange
place

it

a

to
a
wise

righteous
man
known
from
ugaritic

ez
the
authorship
of

complicated

by

by
its

the
overall
chronological
scheme
as
well
as
internal

daniel

chiliastically
related
suggest
an
attempt
at
redactional
unity
after
the
prefatory
tale
emphasizing
the
life
in
court
and
the
loyalty
of
daniel
and
some
youths
to
their
ancestral
religion
a
chronological
ordering
is
discernable
a
sequence
from
king
nebuchadrezzar
to
darius
is
reported
dn
much
of
this
royal
dating
and
even
some
of
the
tales
are
problematic
for
example
daniel
speaks
of
nebuchadrezzars
transformation
into
a
beast
a
story
that
is
reported
in
the
qumran
scrolls
of
nabonidus
belshazzar
is
portrayed
as
the
last
king
of
babylon
although
he
was
never
king
and
darius
is
called
a
mede
who
conquered
babylon
and
is
placed
before
cyrus
ii
of
persia
although
no
such
darius
is
known
the
medes
followed
the
persians
and
darius
is
the
name
of
several
persian
kings
presumably
the
episodes
of
daniel
depicting
a
series
of
monarchical
reversals
episodes
of
ritual
observances
and
reports
of
miraculous
deliverances
were
collected
in
the
seleucid
period
late
fourth
to
midsecond
century
bce
in
order
to
reinvigorate
waning
jewish
hopes
in
divine
providence
and
encourage
steadfast
faith
the
visions
of
daniel
reporting
events
from
the
reign
of
belshazzar
to
that
of
cyrus
ii
but
actually
predicting
the
overthrow
of
seleucid
rule
in
palestine
were
collected
and
published
during
the
reign
of
antiochus
iv
prior
to
the
maccabean
revolt
for
it
was
then
beginning
in
bce
that
the
jews
were
put
to
the
test
concerning
their
allegiance
to
judaism
and
their
ancestral
traditions
and
many
refused
to
desecrate
the
statues
of
moses
and
endured
a
martyrs
death
for
their
resolute
trust
in
divine
dominion
all
of
the
visions
of
daniel
dramatize
this
dominion
in
different
ways
for
example
via
images
of
the
enthronement
of
a
god
of
judgment
with
a
son
of
man
invested
with
rule
this
figure
was
interpreted
by
jews
as
michael
the
archangel
and
by
christians
as
christ
in
chapter
via
zodiacal
images
of
cosmic
beasts
with
bizarre
manifestations
as
in
chapter
or
via
complex
reinterpretations
of
ancient
prophecies
especially
those
of
jeremiah
as
found
in
daniel
the
imagery
of
the
four
beasts
in
chapter
paralleled
by
the
image
of
four
metals
in
chapter
representing
four
kingdoms
to
be
overthrown
by
a
fifth
monarchy
of
divine
origin
is
one
of
the
enduring
images
of
the
book
it
sur
vived
as
a
prototype
of
jewish
and
christian
historical
and
apocalyptic
schemes
to
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
the
role
and
power
of
this
imagery
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
work
of
the
exegete
isaac
abravanel
the
scientist
isaac
newton
and
the
philosopher
jean
bodin
and
among
the
fifth
monarchy
men
of
seventeenth
century
england
for
example
is
abiding
testimony
to
the
use
of
this
ancient
topos
in
organizing
the
chiliastic
imagination
of
diverse
thinkers
and
groups
the
schema
is
still
used
to
this
day
by
various
groups
predicting
the
apocalyptic
advent
the
encouragement
in
the
face
of
religious
persecution
that
is
found
and
propagandized
in
daniel
contains
a
remarkable
reinterpretation
of
isaiah
regarding
the
suffering
servant
of
god
not
as
all
israel
but
as
the
select
faithful
neither
the
opening
stories
about
daniel
and
the
youths
nor
the
final
martyrological
allusions
advocate
violence
or
revolt
they
rather
advocate
a
stance
of
piety
civil
disobedience
and
trustful
resignation
victory
for
the
faithful
is
in
the
hands
of
the
archangel
michael
and
the
martyrs
will
be
resurrected
and
granted
astral
immortality
persumably
the
circles
behind
the
book
were
not
the
same
as
the
maccabean
fighters
and
may
reflect
some
protopharisaic
group
of
hasidim
or
pietists
the
themes
of
resistance
to
oppression
freedom
of
worship
preservation
of
monotheistic
integrity
the
overthrow
of
historical
dominions
and
the
acknowledgement
of
the
god
of
heaven
recur
throughout
the
book
and
have
served
as
a
token
of
trust
for
the
faithful
in
their
darkest
hour

in

where
there
may
have
been
an
old
persian
form
zaraushtra
from
which
the
greek
form
zoroastres
may
be
derived
and
there
may
have
existed
an
old
iranian
form
zaratushtra
to
which
may
be
linked
the
middle
iranian
zrdrwsht
several
middle
persian
forms
such
as
zrtwsht
and
the
new
persian
zardusht
we
can
state
with
certainty
only
that
the
second
half
of
the
name
ushtra
means
camel
the
form
zoroaster
derived
from
the
greek
zoroastres
was
used
traditionally
in
european
culture
until
the
eighteenth
century
when
zarathustra
closer
to
the
original
and
as
found
in
nietzsche
came
into
common
use
after
the
rediscovery
of
the
avesta
the
collection
of
sacred
books
of
zoroastrianism
and
the
resulting
studies
in
iranian
philology
see
avesta
notwithstanding
the
great
and
continued
popularity
of
zarathushtra
even
in
western
culture
the
sources
available
to
us
are
few
extremely
fragmented
and
heterogeneous
our
principle
sources
are
the
five
gathas
songs
attributed
to
zarathushtra
himself
and
included
in
the
yasna
section
of
the
avesta
gatha
ahunavaiti
yasna
gatha
ushtavaiti
yasna
gatha
spentamainyu
yasna
gatha
vokukhshathra
yasna
and
gatha
vashishtoishti
yasna
the
last
of
which
was
probably
written
after
the
prophets
death
other
sources
of
considerable
albeit
varying
importance
are
the
younger
avesta
and
the
remaining
zoroastrian
religious
literature
in
particular
the
pahlavi
texts
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centures
ce
although
the
achaemenid
inscriptions
sixth
to
fourth
centures
bce
never
mention
zarathushtra
he
is
mentioned
by
some
greek
sources
of
the
time
not
however
by
herodotus
who
seems
unaware
of
him
the
avesta
does
not
provide
any
direct
or
explicit
data
concerning
the
true
chronological
history
of
zarathushtra
but
the
text
is
useful
in
an
indirect
way
as
it
clearly
implies
that
the
environment
in
which
zoroastrianism
arose
was
not
that
of
iran
under
the
medes
or
the
persians
the
greek
sources
on
the
other
hand
do
provide
some
information
concerning
the
time
of
zarathushtra
although
from
a
historical
point
of
view
they
are
unreliable
some
place
him
six
thousand
years
before
the
trojan
war
xanthus
of
lydia
eudoxus
of
cnidus
hermippus
hermodorus
aristotle
plutarch
diogenes
laertius
and
pliny
the
account
by
xanthus
of
lydia
however
has
also
been
interpreted
by
some
to
mean
six
hundred
rather
than
six
thousand
years
before
the
expedition
of
xerxes
against
greece
this
interpretation
is
favored
by
diogenes
laertius
who
makes
reference
to
xanthus
but
although
a
few
scholars
a
s
shabazi
helmut
humbach
have
recently
attempted
to
rehabilitate
it
under
various
pretexts
it
is
generally
rejected
although
the
historical
value
of
the
greek
sources
is
negligible
they
are
nonetheless
important
in
that
they
show
that
the
millenarian
doctrine
of
history
of
the
cosmos
had
already
been
developed
in
iran
by
the
achaemenid
period
as
the
above
account
would
seem
to
demonstrate
they
also
show
that
by
this
time
zarathushtra
was
already
seen
as
an
almost
mythical
figure
one
from
an
extremely
distant
past
all
of
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prophet
could
not
have
belonged
to
a
historical
period
contemporary
with
or
even
close
to
that
of
the
achaemenids
later
zoroastrian
sources
the
pahlavi
texts
do
provide
an
absolute
chrono
logy
for
zarathushtra
one
that
was
also
accepted
by
some
arab
authors
accord
ing
to
these
sources
zarathushtra
lived
or
years
before
alexander
again
scholars
are
divided
on
the
validity
of
the
chronology
some
view
it
as
historically
reliable
while
others
believe
that
it
is
devoid
of
historical
justification
the
most
convincing
arguments
however
seem
to
support
the
latter
position
the
figure
of
years
is
accurate
only
on
the
surface
because
it
represents
in
fact
the
more
general
one
of
which
was
employed
by
sasanid
propagandists
to
locate
zarathushtras
lifetime
roughly
around
the
beginning
of
iranian
domination
for
a
number
of
reasons
connected
with
complex
problems
inherent
in
the
iranian
chronology
there
was
also
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
sasanid
propagandists
to
avoid
any
millenarian
threat
in
this
context
zarathushtra
whom
tradition
places
early
in
the
ninth
millennium
after
the
beginning
of
the
cosmos
converted
vishtaspa
at
the
age
of
fortytwo
and
vishtaspas
conversion
was
viewed
by
some
as
the
beginning
of
the
millennium
thus
explaining
the
double
date
of
and
years
before
alexander
given
the
unreliability
of
the
few
available
sources
we
are
forced
to
reconstruct
an
absolute
chronology
on
the
basis
of
other
elements
principally
on
the
contention
that
zarathushtra
must
have
lived
a
few
centuries
before
cyrus
the
great
cambyses
and
darius
as
there
is
no
mention
in
the
avesta
of
the
great
political
achievements
that
took
place
in
western
iran
in
the
middle
of
the
first
millennium
bce
nor
is
there
any
mention
of
the
history
of
that
period
which
was
to
lead
iran
to
a
position
of
such
predominance
at
the
same
time
for
a
number
of
reasons
going
back
much
further
in
history
would
not
be
justified
consequently
the
traditionally
accepted
theory
of
placing
zara
thushtra
around
the
beginning
of
the
first
millennium
bce
appears
to
be
the
most
legitimate
as
to
zarathushtras
land
of
origin
many
scholars
agree
on
the
basis
of
valid
arguments
that
he
must
have
come
from
eastern
iran
some
have
held
that
he
was
a
mede
largely
because
of
a
late
iranian
tradition
linking
zarathushtra
with
azerbaijan
but
also
because
of
linguistic
reasons
based
on
the
language
of
the
avesta
this
hypothesis
however
should
be
discarded
as
we
can
suppose
both
on
historical
and
linguistic
grounds
that
zarathushtra
came
from
the
east
even
though
we
do
not
know
precisely
from
which
region
there
is
a
considerable
variety
of
opinion
on
this
particular
matter
including
the
improbable
view
that
he
came
from
chorasmia
or
presentday
khorezm
or
from
a
wider
chorasmian
region
reaching
as
far
as
the
oases
of
merv
and
herat
most
likely
however
zarathushtras
land
of
origin
is
somewhere
in
the
vast
area
stretching
from
the
hindu
kush
mountain
range
to
the
more
southern
regions

zarathushtra
himself
tells
us
that
he
belonged
to
the
priestly
caste
yasna
he
was
a
zaotar
cf
sanskrit
hotr
that
is
a
priest
belonging
to
a
specific
group
connected
with
a
school
that
produced
very
elaborate
and
learned
religious
poetry
even
in
the
socalled
younger
avesta
he
is
described
as
an
athravan
yashts
a
more
general
term
encompassing
the
entire
priestly
caste
to
enter
it
he
had
undergone
a
long
and
rigid
training
which
he
used
to
lend
dignity
as
in
the
gathas
to
the
contents
of
his
new
message
the
product
of
a
great
and
original
ethical
mind
zarathushtra
also
belongs
to
that
venerable
priestly
tradition
linking
india
to
iran
in
another
way
by
centering
his
teachings
on
the
praise
of
the
ashavan
or
possessor
of
asha
that
is
the
one
who
as
in
the
vedic
rtavan
seeks
truth
and
masters
it
thus
becoming
ashavan
in
this
life
almost
an
initiate
and
blessed
after
death
any
good
follower
of
such
teachings
seeks
the
vision
of
asha
just
as
those
chosing
the
right
path
in
vedic
india
aspired
to
the
vision
of
the
sun
a
manifestation
of
rta
behind
these
concepts
and
this
language
lies
the
great
tradition
of
aryan
mysticism
that
is
of
indoiranian
mysticism
zarathushtras
greatness
however
does
not
lie
in
his
having
belonged
to
a
particular
religious
tradition
rather
it
lies
in
the
innovation
and
strength
of
his
message
which
was
in
itself
a
break
in
the
tradition
one
that
force
fully
and
effectively
introduced
two
great
revolutionary
ideas
dualistic
monotheism
the
wise
lord
who
fathers
two
twin
spirits
the
beneficent
and
the
evil
and
the
expectation
of
a
transfiguration
av
frashokereti
pahl
frashgird
of
life
and
existence
see
frashokereti
both
his
monotheistic
and
dualistic
ideas
and
his
particular
soteriological
doctrine
deeply
separate
zarathushtras
teachings
from
the
indoiranian
tradi
tions
of
his
upbringing
they
exemplify
his
rebellion
against
a
formalistic
and
ritualistic
religion
that
did
not
provide
adequate
answers
to
the
problem
of
evil
because
of
his
basic
tenets
zarathushtra
who
advocated
an
inward
religiosity
and
the
right
of
the
individual
to
resist
the
imperatives
of
tradi
tion
can
be
numbered
among
the
greatest
of
religious
figures
another
original
facet
of
zarathushtras
message
one
that
is
not
easy
to
understand
but
which
however
holds
the
key
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
complex
intellectual
and
poetic
structure
of
the
gathas
is
the
doctrine
of
the
amesha
spentas
the
beneficent
immortals
these
are
spiritualizations
of
the
abstract
notions
of
good
thought
best
truth
desirable
power
bounteous
devotion
wholeness
and
immortality
all
of
which
operate
according
to
a
system
of
interrelations
and
correlations
and
can
simultaneously
be
the
manifestations
of
a
divinity
and
of
human
virtue

names
of
his
father

gray
horses
and
of

the
names
of
four
brothers
according
to
tradition
zarathushtra
left
home
at
the
age
of
twenty
and
at
thirty
he
was
subject
to
a
revelation
both
through
an
intense
and
powerful
inspiration
and
through
a
vision
only
after
ten
years
had
passed
however
did
he
succeed
in
converting
a
cousin
of
his
maidhyoimah
to
his
beliefs
he
was
strongly
opposed
in
his
native
land
by
kavis
karapans
and
usijs
priestly
groups
associated
with
traditional
teachings
and
practices
this
hostility
caused
him
to
leave
his
region
yasna
and
to
seek
refuge
at
the
court
of
kavi
vishtaspa
a
ruler
who
had
been
converted
to
the
new
religion
together
with
his
wife
hutaosa
when
the
prophet
according
to
tradition
was
fortytwo
years
old
we
also
know
the
name
of
a
son
isat
vastra
desiring

and
of
three
daughters
born
of
his
first

great
popularity
in

ancient
world

throughout

renaissance
until

during

viewed
zarathushtra
as
a
precursor
of
the
christian
faith
one
who
not
only
prophesied
as
had
the
biblical
prophets
the
advent
of
the
messiah
but
also
predicted
the
supernatural
sign
of
his
coming
the
star
that
was
to
appear
in
the
east
and
guide
the
three
magi
to
the
manger
in
bethlehem
see
magi
this
christian
interpretation
is
derived
from
the
zoroastrian
doctrine
of
the
saoshyant
the
savior
of
the
future
see
saoshyant
later
however
religious
struggles
arose
during
the
sasanid
empire
in
persia
third
to
seventh
centuries
ce
which
linked
the
spread
of
christianity
with
the
roman
empire
zarathushtras
popularity
in
the
christian
world
began
to
decline
the
iranian
prophet
who
had
been
praised
often
by
the
gnostic
schools
and
who
had
been
seen
by
mani
as
one
of
the
three
great
messengers
from
the
past
was
now
seen
instead
as
a
leader
of
imposture
and
heresy
a
teacher
of
the
diabolic
arts
of
witchery
but
during
the
renaiss
ance
and
the
enlightenment
european
cultures
reverted
to
the
image
of
zara
thushtra
that
had
come
down
through
classical
and
hellenistic
antiquity
he
was
viewed
once
again
as
a
great
and
wise
man
as
the
author
of
the
chaldean
oracles
and
probably
inventor
of
qabbalah
as
a
teacher
of
astrology
as
a
possible
bridge
between
christianity
and
platonism
and
at
times
as
in

as
a
symbol
of
nonchristian
wisdom
after

eighteenth

or
what

this

depends
on
what

again
this
is
a
false

to
begin
with
the
notion
of

is
distinctly
dubious
many

believe

they
even
believe
that

and
certain
many
believe
that
there
are

that
cannot
be
expressed
using
the
language
of

let

be

these
truths
are
neither
higher

lower
they
are
simply
true
more
to
the
point
restricting
ones
discussion
of
origins
to
science
does
not
reject
other
sources
of

it
simply
restricts
the
scope
of

this
is
a
false
premise
if
this
is
intended

asserting
that
the
previous
sentence
was
false
then
is
actually
true
however
the
context
identifies
it
as

enjoy
science
on
the
evidence
mr
rawlins
lacks
sufficient
understanding
of
science
to
enjoy
science
in
any
meaningful
sense
one
might
just
as
well
say
that
one
enjoys
literature
written
in
a
language
that
one
cannot
read
however
one
cannot
mark
this
sentence
as
false
to
follow
the
analogy
perhaps
he
likes
the
pretty
shapes
of
the
letters
it
is
truly
a
wonder
observing
gods
creation
let
us
not
quibble
count
this
one
as
true
macroevolution
is
a
mixture
of
percent
science
and
percent
religion
guaranteed
within
three
percent
error
still
another
false
statement
however
one
can
make
it
come
out
true
with
the
following
contextual
modification
macroevolution
as
misunderstood
by
rawline
is
a
mixture
of
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
science
and
percent
of
what
rawlins
erroneously
thinks
of
as
religion
it
is
distinctly
noticeable
that
mr
rawlins
fails
miserably
to
touch
on
truth
except
when
he
reports
personally
on
what
he
feels
i
do
him
the
justice
of
assuming
that
he
is
not
misinforming
us
as
to
his
personal
reactions
one
can
account
for
this
by
the
hypothesis
that
he
has
an
idiosyncratic
and
personal
concept
of
truth

firstly
science
has
its
basis
in
values
not
the
other
way
round
so
you
better
explain
what
objective
atoms
are
and
how
we
get
them
from
subjective
values
before
we
go
any
further
atoms
are
not
objective
they
arent
even
real
what
scientists
call
an
atom
is
nothing
more
than
a
mathematical
model
that
describes
certain
physical
observable
properties
of
our
surroundings
all
of
which
is
subjective
what
is
objective
though
is
the
approach
a
scientist
takes
in
discussing
his
model
and
his
observations
there
is
no
objective
science
but
there
is
an
objective
approach
which
is
subjectively
selected
by
the
scientist
objective
in
this
case
means
a
specified
unchanging
set
of
rules
that
he
and
his
colleagues
use
to
discuss
their
science
this
is
in
contrast
to
your
objective
morality
there
may
be
an
objective
approach
to
subjectively
discuss
your
beliefs
on
morality
but
there
exists
no
objective
morality
also
science
deals
with
how
we
can
discuss
our
observations
of
the
physical
world
around
us
in
that
the
method
of
discussion
is
objective
not
the
science
not
the
discussion
itself
science
makes
no
claims
to
know
the
whys
or
even
the
hows
sometimes
of
what
we
can
observe
it
simply
gives
us
a

sorry

yes
he
does
by
your
own
description
he
still
loves
us
sending
jesus
was
one
of
his
attempts
to
reconcile
with
mankind
humorous
this
notion
of
an
allknowing
allpowerful
god
who
must
attempt
to
reconcile
with
his
lowly
creations
i
realize
that
it
is
not
possible
to
penetrate
such
logic
but
is
there
any
chance
that
you
might
consider
that
an
omnipotent
god
need
not
attempt
anything
and
further
that
an
attempt
to
reconcile
implies
a
lack
of
omniscience
what
you
are
doing
here
is
projecting
human
weaknesses
onto
your
god
also
while
were
at
it
how
do
you
reconcile
a
kind
and
loving
god
with
the
judeochristian
view
that
sin
was
at
one
time
immediately
punishable
by
death
was
killing
people
for
sinning
gods
way
of
showing
kindness
and
love
sinning
in
the
face
of
god
was
punishable
by
immediate
death
there
are
several
ot
passages
to
back
this
up
god
is
god
but
all
humans
are
sinners
thus
all
prejesus
humans
should
have
been
punished
with
death
we
arent
punished
with
sin
now
of
course
because
god
has
changed
he
required
a
brutal
sadistic
sacrifice
of
his
own
blood
in
order
to
allow
us
to
sin
without
immediate
death
he
cannot
tolerate
the
prescence
of
sin
in
his
midst
yet
he
does
so
now
he
has
changed
the
sadistic
murder
of
his
own
son
has
made
him
more
tolerant
of
our
sins
besides
his
midst
is
everywhere
so
your
statement
is
meaningless
he
tolerates
sin
in
hell
which
surely
is
in
his
midst
as
well
also
given
that
he
is
allknowing
he
must
have
eternal
knowledge
of
who
will
commit
which
sins
as
well
as
when
and
where
so
what
does
tolerance
have
to
do
with
anything
all
of
this
is
absolute
nonsense
unless
your
god
is
not
indeed
allknowing
and
allpowerful
or
unless
he
doesnt
take
the
personal
interest
in
everyday
affairs
that
you
claim
and
the
israelites
knew
this
and
still
some
of
them
chose
to
disobey
and
were
destroyed
were
these
people
kind
and
loving
themselves
not
relevant
the
claim
of
kindness
and
lovingness
was
made
by
you
in
reference
to
your
god
the
nature
of
his
creationsvictims
is
not
at
issue
god
gave
them
every
break
he
could
but
in
the
end
he
really
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
i
see
an
allknowing
god
who
did
not
know
what
the
ultimate
outcome
would
be
and
an
allpowerful
god
who
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
mindmush
seeing
as
how
we
were
failing
to
achieve
salvation
on
our
own
he
sent
his
son
to
die
for
us
to
be
the
ultimate
sin
offering
did
i
miss
something
did
you
give
some
indication
at
to
why
a
kind
and
loving
god
should
require
sadistic
human
sacrifice
to
allow
his
own
botched
creations
to
achieve
salvation
is
the
fact
the
he
no
longer
does
this
an
admission
on
his
part
of
having
made
a
mistake
he
sent
his
son
as
a
consolation
to
us
out
of
love
i
note
that
your
answer
physically
follows
my
question
but
i
fail
to
discern
a
connection
between
the
two
by
the
way
for
what
am
i
being
consoled
now
that
we
are
living
in
the
age
of
grace
does
this
mean
that
for
our
sins
god
now
damns
us
to
eternal
hell
after
we
die
rather
than
killing
us
immediately
if
so
is
this
eternal
damnation
an
example
of
a
kind
and
loving
god
hey
lets
be
fair
for
a
moment
here
kind
and
loving
does
not
mean
a
free
ride
why
not
by
the
way
i
note
for
the
record
that
you
didnt
answer
the
questions
there
is
an
amount
of
give
and
take
as
in
any
relationship
parents
are
supposed
to
be
kind
and
loving
but
does
that
mean
that
children
can
do
whatever
they
want
not
part
of
being
a
parent
means
administering
punishment
when
the
child
is
at
fault
death
andor
eternal
damnation
is
your
idea
of
correctional
punishment
i
hope
you
arent
a
parent
part
of
being
a
parent
means
giving
instruction
god
tests
us
through
the
trial
of
life
such
that
we
may
grow
stronger
he
teaches
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
this
is
quite
an
elaborate
fantasy
that
youve
constructed
but
sadly
it
lacks
a
basis
in
reality
it
also
does
not
address
the
questions
that
i
raised
the
consequences
of
our
actions
are
made
clear
to
us
be
it
heaven
or
be
it
hell
if
god
did
not
follow
through
with
what
he
has
warned
us
about
he
would
not
be
a
very
good
parent
the
god
that
you
describe
is
not
a
good
parent
but
a
tyrant
in
parenting
if
a
parent
issues
a
warning
but
does
not
follow
through
with
it
the
children
will
not
take
that
parents
words
very
seriously
god
does
the
same
by
telling
us
who
have
ears
to
hear
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
by
lifes
trials
we
see
the
folly
of
doing
our
own
will
rather
than
his
he
warns
us
about
the
consequences
of
rejecting
him
when
it

judgement

how
about

you
take

it

that

it
might
be
better
to

this
makes
sense
to
me
im
serious
youve
explained
something
to
me
which
i
never
understood
before
but
just
for
grins
suppose
we
almost
all
agree
that
we
are
in
a
set
of
circumstances
called
reality
what
then
then
we
all
live
happily
ever
after
seriously
if
we
all
agreed
on
the
circumstances
were
in
i
suspect
wed
all
agree
on
the
best
course
of
action
unfortunately
i
have
no
confidence
that
such
a
situation
will
ever
arise
some
of
us
think
theres
a
big
god
in
the
sky
some
dont
some
think
theyve
been
chosen
by
god
others
disagree
some
think
they
are
infallible
others
think
otherwise
until
those
disagreements
over
circumstances
can
be
ironed
out
theres
little
hope
of
everyone
agreeing
or
say
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
there
is
no
frame
of
reference
in
which
thus
and
such
is
good
isnt
that
approximately
objective
in
the
same
way
that
we
usually
expect
a
speeding
bullet
to
outrun
a
snail
yes
i
think
that
for
example
only
a
vanishingly
small
number
of
people
would
hold
that
theres
a
frame
of
reference
in
which
gassing
six
million
jews
is
good
so
thats
probably
about
as
close
to
an
objective
moral
value
as
ive
encountered
in
my
life
so
far
for
example
if
we
hear
of
a
bomb
in
a
crowded
area
isnt
it
a
rather
sensible
first
guess
that
this
is
an
immoral
act
even
though
there
conceivably
might
be
some
tailend
case
that
would
justify
it
well
i
think
your
examples
poor
if
the
bombs
in
iraq
for
example
and
was
dropped
by
an
american
plane
many
people
would
hold
that
it
was
a
moral
act
and
what
weasel
word
do
you
use
to
describe
that
frame
of
reference
if
it
isnt
an
objective
reality
for
values
im
sorry
i
cant
parse
an
objective
reality
for
values
could
you
tr
y
again
san
objective
reality
for
valuessome
values
are
real
even
in
the
face
of
disagreement
i
still
dont
quite
see
what
youre
trying
to
say
i
assume
by
values
you
mean
moral
values
yes
in
which
case
what
do
you
mean
by
real
what
is
a
real
moral
value
as
opposed
to
an
unreal
one
i
mean
to
say
that
values
are
as
real
as
horses
whatever
you
understand
by
a
horse
being
real
is
pretty
much
what
i
mean
about
a
value
being
real
hmm
so
these
moral
values
have
a
perceptible
physical
presence
if
you
are
saying
that
some
moral
systems
are
better
than
others
in
your
opinion
then
all
you
get
is
infinite
regress
sorry
but
in
what
way
is
it
an
infinite
regress
it
looks
extremely
finite
to
me
i
meant
that
its
never
more
than
your
opinion
right
and
the
chain
ends
right
there
the
buck
stops
with
me
its
not
an
infinite
regress
youve
clarified
this
for
me
above
my
understanding
is
now
that
if
a
supermajority
of
relativists
agree
that
thus
and
such
is
wrong
in
almost
any
or
all
frames
of
reference
then
theyre
saying
something
which
is
to
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
no
different
than
what
im
saying
right
the
key
point
however
is
that
there
are
vanishingly
few
of
these
moral
issues
where
we
can
get
of
people
to
agree
on
the
outcome
for
all
frames
of
reference
and
agree
on
the
frames
of
reference
what
you
do
not
get
is
any
justification
for
saying
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
sorry
but
thats
not
so
i
can
provide
a
justification
for
asserting
that
the
moral
system
of
the
terrorist
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
man
of
peace
i
just
cant
provide
a
justification
which
works
in
all
possible
circumstances
logically
possible
or
actually
possible
i
cant
manage
either
killing
hitler
using
a
car
bomb
would
have
been
a
terrorist
act
but
i
have
to
admit
that
i
couldnt
exactly
condemn
it
although
there
are
tricky
philosophical
issues
to
do
with
hindsight
by
which
i
mean
are
you
stretching
possible
to
include
events
such
as
the
atoms
in
my
terminal
switching
places
so
that
the
terminal
turns
upside
down
or
do
you
think
it
likely
that
circumstances
will
arise
in
which
terrorism
is
superior
to
peace
i
think
that
circumstances
have
already
arisen
where
terrorism
would
have
been
better
than
peace
better
in
terms
of
numbers
of
innocent
people
killed
assuming
it
was
successful
terrorism

for

but
it
would
clarify
further
if
you
would

from
the
point

of
any
disinterested
observers
perhaps
an
observer
as
likely
to
be
in
position
a
as
in
position
b
where
a
and
b
disagree
in
the
future
and
have
his
or
her
conclusion
now
binding
on
them
at
that
time
well
if
our
observer
x
is
as
likely
to
be
in

position
as
bs
and
if
he
agrees
that
both
a
and
b
are
making
appropriate
observations
and
inferences
regarding
the
situation
then
i
would
expect
him
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
right
answer
hopefully
there
would
be
some
other
factor
which
would
allow
him
to
make
some
judgement
regarding
which
answer
to
accept
if
on
the
other
hand
he
disagrees
with
the
principles
of
either
a
or
b
i
suspect
he
would
make
a
decision
in
favour
of
the
other
one
it
is
unfortunately
the
case
that
not
all
moral
arguments
have
answers
from
all
perspectives
for
instance
i
am
completely
unable
to
come
to
any
conclusion
regarding
whether
abortion
should
be
allowed
or
not
from
my
perspective
in
an
ideal
world
all
living
things
would
have
a
right
to
life
but
in
an
ideal
world
women
would
have
the
absolute
right
to
do
what
they
like
with
their
own
bodies
clearly
there
is
no
way
to
resolve
in
favour
of
both
these
principles
therefore
i
agree
with
the
compromise
solution
of
allowing
abortion
up
to
a
certain
time
after
conception
and
deciding
on
the
time
based
on
various
sometimes
illdefined
criteria
this
is
also
a
sensible
move
i
think
because
it
lets
people
make
their
own
decisions
within
reason
and
for
what
its
worth
i
am
reasonably
happy
with
current
uk
abortion
law
similarly
the
situation
in
whats
left
of
yugoslavia
is
a
horrible
mess
and
i
really
cant
see
my
way
to
any
sort
of
conclusion
there
i
dont
even
know
enough
to

his
interest
in
the
bd
disaster
is
from
a
civil
liberties
issue
not
an
attempt
to
justify
koreshs

i
agree
with
joe
about
this
if
some
group
wants
to
believe
in
whatever
god
or
invisible
pink
unicorns
and
go
off
and
live
together
and
have
group
sex
or
no
sex
or
sex
only
for
the
leaders
but
not
with
children
then
as
much
as
i
might
believe
them
to
be
misguided
i
think
they
should
have
the
legal
right
and
i
hope
the
investigation
will
start
by
determining
whether
the
feds
had
any
legitimate
reason
for
going
after

the
first
place

moving

joe
goes
on
to
dispute
the
childabuse
allegations
ill
provisionally
accept
this
unless
someone
has
evidence
to
support
the
allegations
actually
i
wasnt
thinking
about
the
alleged
child
abuse
but
about
the
reports
that
he
had
sex
with
and
fathered
children
by
several
women
in
the
cult
i
agree
this
is
not
a
legal
matter
consenting
adults
and
all
that
but
stephen
tice
seems
to
be
defending
koreshs
beliefs
and
practices
from
specifically
christian
perspective
not
a
civil

perspective
i
think
my
question
is
not
really
aimed
at
joe
and
possibly
not
at
ray

who
seems
to
also

youre

asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
dear
joakim
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
these
are
excellent
questions
but
that
by
asking
you
will
find
as
many
different
explanations
as
there
are
respondents
as
a
latterday
saint
i
believe
that
all
of
us
you
me
etc
lived
once
as
spiritchildren
of
god
the
father
hebrews
in
the
premortal
existance
in
order
to
continue
our
eternal
progression
an
earthly
probationary
time
was
required
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
to
choose
good
over
evil
and
to
prepare
ourselves
in
all
things
to
become
worthy
of
a
higher
order
of
existance
we
believe
that
all
of
gods
spiritoffspring
were
once
assembled
to
discuss
the
specifics
of
this
earthly
sojourn
onethird

the

christ
lucifers
aspirations
i
will
exalt
my

isaiah
etc
resulted
into
the
rebellion
of
his
followers
against
the
firstborn
and
those
who
followed
him
resulting
in
the
casting
out
of
lucifer
who
became
satan
the
father
of
lies
and
onethird
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
his
tail
drew
the
third
part
of
the
stars
of
heaven
and
did
cast
them
to
the
earth
revelation
as
demons
evil
spirits
to
get
back
on
our
choice
to
be
born
on
this
earth
and
to
be
subject
to
god
and
his
plan
for
good
or
bad
based
upon
our
obedience
and
choices
we
made
that
choice
individually
god
speaking
to
job
where
wast
thou
when
i
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
when
the
morning
stars
sang
together
and
all
the
sons
of
god
shouted
for
joy
job
we
lost
the
knowledge
of
our
premortal
existance
the
veil
of
forgetful
ness
somewhere
in
psalms
in
order
to
live
by
faith
not
by
sight
you
may
not
accept
this
scenario
neither
do
quite
a
few
who
rely
on
the
bible
alone
which
offers
only
fragmentary
insights
into
this
particular
aspect
of
our
existence
as
individuals
as
sons
and
daughters
of
god
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to

are
all

that

the
rest
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
all

by
definition
are
a

sheep
following
the
shepherd
as
they
understand
him

in
any

not
all

the

cry
heresy

other
accusations

perverting
the

themselves
believe
in
a

of
interpretations
as
found
in

as
for
me
i
have
a
personal
conviction
that
the

is
most
in

me
begin
by
saying
i
think
this
is
the
worlds
first
religion
to
use
the
net
as
its
major
recruitment
medium
therefore
even
if
this
religion
does
not
take
off
its
founding
members
will
be
very
important
historically
as
this
method
of
soliciting
membership
will
eventually
become
common
the
basis
of
this
religion
is
to
apply
various
aspects
of
current
conventional
morality
to
the
characters
in
genesis
and
exodus
but
assume
that
the
bibles
accounts
of
the
facts
and
historical
events
is
correct
for
example
story
of
adam
and
eve
adam
and
eve
are
in
garden
of
eden
naked
and
ignorant
have
unlimited
supply
of
food
provided
but
no
clothing
jobs
or
knowledge
god
says
not
to
eat
fruit
of
tree
of
knowledge
they
do
anyway
then
try
to
hide
in
bushes
god
finds
them
and
forces
them
out
of
garden
there
are
several
different
stories
on
what
they
were
doing
while
naked
in
the
bushes
that
might
have
angered
god
traditional
philosophy
the
only
reason
you
need
knowledge
or
a
job
is
to
eat
if
someone
else
will
provide
you
with
food
then
you
can
be
stupid
and
unemployed
and
its
ok
this
is
why
married
women
usually
didnt
work
until
recent
decades
authority
figures
such
as
god
whoever
was
behind
the
vietnam
war
hitler
and
slaveowners
are
always
right
and
should
be
blindly
followed
without
question
by
ordinary
people
who
cant
make
decisions
for
themselves
interpretation
of
events
based
on
traditional
philosophy
they
were
not
supposed
to
eat
the
fruit
they
should
have
done
whatever
god
told
them
to
like
small
children
they
had
their
needs
provided
for
and
were
obligated
to
do
whatever
their
father
said
to
being
forced
to
leave
the
garden
and
work
in
order
to
obtain
food
was
a
punishment
lessons
from
traditional
interpretation
ignorance
is
good
knowledge
is
bad
but
tempting
having
food
provided
for
you
for
nothing
read
welfare
is
ideal
get
ting
a
job
and
feeding
yourself
with
what
you
earn
is
punishment
public
nudity
is
good
covering
up
is
bad
authority
figures
are
intrinsically
right
normal
people
are
dumb
and
should
do
whatever
they
are
told
without
question
they
should
not
think
for
themselves
people
in
subordinate
positions
are
especially
obligated
to
refrain
from
learning
for
example
it
should
be
illegal
for
slaves
to
learn
to
read
philosophy
people
should
seek
education
and
employment
outside
the
home
unless
named
hillary
clinton
or
murphy
brown
people
should
use
common
sense
they
should
not
kill
other
people
binding
of
issac
wars
holocaust
etc
just
because
they
are
told
to
interpretation
of
events
based
on
current
philosophy
they
were
supposed
to
eat
the
fruit
god
gave
wanted
them
to
seek
knowledge
rather
than
be
handed
it
on
a
silver
platter
once
they
had
gained
knowledge
and
by
seeking
it
showed
their
ability
to
make
mature
decisions
for
them
selves
they
no
longer
needed
to
be
treated
like
little
children
and
were
rewarded
by
being
allowed
into
the
real
world
lessons
from
new
interpretation
ignorance
is
bad
knowledge
is
good
but
must
be
sought
having
food
provided
for
you
for
nothing
read
welfare
is
at
best
a
temporary
measure
getting
a
job
and
feeding
yourself
with
what
you
earn
is
ideal
public
nudity
is
bad
covering
up
is
good
authority
figures
are
often
wrong
normal
people
are
intelligent
and
should
consider
whether
the
instructions
are
really
a
good
idea
and
alter
or
abolish
bad
governments
they
should
think
for
themselves
people
in
subordinate
decisions
are
often
discouraged
from
knowledge
but
should
seek
it
anyway
and
all
the
harder
for
example
poor
children
without
good
schools
should
work
especially
hard
in
order
to
make
a
better
life
for
their
children
and
themselves
i
have
tentatively
named
this
new
philosophy
the
church
of
eveism
because
eves
decision
to
eat
the
apple
is
mansickinds
first
good
decision
instead
of
its
first
bad
one
as
traditionally
believed
she
is
therefore
clearly
a
protagonist
god
at
first
appears
evil
for
telling
people
not
to
seek
knowledge
but
on
deeper
analysis
is
also
a
protagonist
as
god
rewarded
the
decision
to
defy
him
and
provided
the
tree
in
the
first
place
the
intention
and
desire
were
clearly
to
have
the
knowledge
be
obtained
but
to
delay
it
until
it
was
actively
sought
end
serious
discussion
begin
humor
save
this
post
to
disk
or
file
server
someday
it
will
be
considered
the
most
important
writing
since
the
commandments
you

stay

stephen

weinssrpiedu
subject
re
is
it
good
that
jesus
died
brian
kendig
first
states
i
am
my
own
master
i
ask
are
you
truly
the
master
of
yourself
brian
kendig
states
not
yet
make
up
your
mind
but
my
life
is
the
ground
i
use
to
practice
on
the
fun
is
in
the
getting
there
we
dont
start
out
perfect
and
we
do
not
end
perfect
either
we
are
never
perfect
can
you
name
one
person
young
or
old
past
or
present
that
you
deem
perfect
good
luck
i
know
my
shortcomings
and
i
know
my
strengths
and
i
live
my
life
according
to
the
decisions
i
make
and
i
am
content
to
abide
with
the
consequences
of
my
decisions
as
easily
as
ill
accept
the
praise
for
them
there
have
been
times
in
my
life
when
ive
made
mistakes
yes
i
try
to
never
make
the
same
mistake
twice
then
you
lie
to
yourself
you
do
not
know
your
shortcomings
i
have
clearly
shown
one
of
your
shortcomings
if
not
two
that
is
ignorance
of
the
bible
and
the
arrogance
you
demonstrate
butchering
it
without
even
knowing
its
contents
i
regard
christ
as
a
myth
because
you
have
been
too
prideful
to
examine
the
record
of
him
for
yourself
and
to
demonstate
your
lack
of
support
for
your
conclusion
i
bet
you
do
not
even
know
what
the
word
christ
means
or
which
prophet
used
christ
to
describe
the
son
of
man
i
feel
that
there
are
far
too
many
people
offering
far
too
many
interpretations
of
what
he
supposedly
said
and
did
the
only
person
who
can
really
judge
me
is
me
yes
i
agree
with
that
so
we
must
learn
first
read
the
bible
come
up
with
our
own
interpretation
evaluate
what
is
being
said
and
by
whom
check
the
history
books
as
well
compare
someone
elses
interpretation
with
your
own
then
make
a
judgment
but
i
tell
you
the
truth
of
what
is
being
said
in
the
bible
needs
interpretation
as
much
as
a
coffee
cup
needs
interpretation
and
remember
the
bible
isnt
a
gurus
esoteric
guide
to
metaphysics
it
doesnt
take
a
theologian
to
understand
what
is
being
said
the
bible
is
a
bunch
of
testimonies
from
people
like
you
and
i
addressed
to
people
like
you
and
i
these
guys
wrote
down
what
they
saw
and
heard
is
it
their
open
diaryand
they
want
to
tell
you
something
and
because
they
want
you
to
know
something
they
make
it
very
clear
what
they
want
you
to
know
they
didnt
encouch
their
ideas
in
esoteric
rhetoric
but
in
simple
straightforward
language
i
choose
the
roads
i
travel
and
i
decide
whether
or
not
i
want
to
reach
the
end
of
any
given
road
or
turn
back
and
as
long
as
i
dont
always
turn
back
theres
no
shame
in
it
when
i
need
help
i
seek
out
my
friends
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
the
bible
you
have
chosen
the
road
that
avoids
a
confrontation
with
the
living
god
because
that
road
doesnt
look
appealing
to
you
you
rather
build
your
own
road
one
that
goes
far
away
from
that
confrontation
but
be
assured
of
this
you
will
have
to
confront
him
one
day
willingly
or
unwillingly
and
you
dont
have
a
clue
about
what
im
saying
either
open
your
eyes
and
see
open
your
ears
and
listen
im
not
just
spouting
off
empty
words
this
is
my
life
this
is
what
gives
me
meaning
i
see
what
you
mean
i
hear
what
your
saying
i
am
not
degrading
your
life
but
i
have
heard
the
same
irrational
excuses
for
years
there
is
nothing
new
in
what
you
are
saying
and
by
your
own
words
you
are
spouting
off
contradictions
if
contradictions
give
you
meaning
then
your
life
must
be
sad
i
say
my
mother
loves
me
how
do
i
know
you
ask
i
can
point
to
definite
things
shes
done
for
me
and
i
can
even
just
bring
her
to
you
so
you
can
ask
her
facetoface
you
say
your
deity
loves
you
how
do
you
know
i
ask
bingo
for
god
so
loved
the
world
he
gave
his
only
begotton
to
son
so
that
whososever
belives
in
him
will
have
ever
lasting
life
i
look
what
god
did
he
has
given
his
son
even
to
his
death
so
that
i
can
have
hope
in
his
resurrection
and
know
that
life
isnt
for
nothing
but
has
glorious
purpose
you
cant
even
convince
me
that
it
exists
because
you
turn
your
eyes
away
from
testimony
and
history
you
choose
to
lie
to
yourself
that
he
doesnt
exist
for
you
ignore
what
has
been
said
for
thousands
of
years
you
sound
exactly
almost
verbatim
like
the
lazarus
of
jesuss
story
starting
in
luke
and
the
conclusion
of
that
story
is
a
bleak
one
lazarus
wound
up
in
hell
the
story
ends
like
this
for
if
lazarus
doesnt
even
listen
to
moses
and
the
prophets
he
wont
even
believe
if
a
man
rose
from
the
dead
if
any
god
dangles
heaven
before
me
like
a
carrot
promising
untold
pleasures
to
me
if
ill
only
suspend
my
disbelief
and
ignore
my
rationality
for
just
this
once
then
i
would
choose
hell
i
can
not
lie
to
myself
to
placate
another
being
no
matter
how
powerful
it
is
arrogance
at
its
best
the
fact
is
you
are
not
rational
several
specific
cases
have
already
been
cited
and
again
with
this
new
statement
you
show
more
irrationality
with
regards
to
heaven
jesus
does
tell
you
something
of
what
to
expect
in
heaven
jesus
expects
you
to
use
your
brain
to
believe
in
him
jesus
does
not
expect
you
to
placate
either
jesus
wants
you
to
willingly
come
to
him
but
not
as
his
grovelling
slave
but
rather
as
his
brother
who
will
share
in
his
glorious
riches
why
do
you
not
pick
up
the
bible
and
read
it
for
yourself
you
maintain
you
have
an
open
mind
see
whether
you
are
lying
to
yourself
for
yourself
why
would
you
want
to
live
a
good
life
to
you
you
die
and
thats
it
dont
contradict
yourself
you
have
no
reason
to
live
a
good
life
it
doesnt
do
you
any
good
in
the
end
your
life
doesnt
do
anybody
else
any
good
either
because
everyone
dies
anyway
so
you
have
no
reason
to
lead
a
good
life
leading
a
good
life
is
meaningless
why
do
you
do
such
a
meaningless
thing
that
paragraph
demonstrates
that
you
havent
listened
to
a
single
word
ive
said
i
do
understand
what
you
said
but
thats
is
not
what
i
feel
went
amiss
here
you
missed
the
point
living
a
good
life
has
no
eternal
consequences
once
they
close
the
amusement
park
of
life
to
you
that
is
the
end
to
you
it
is
over
to
you
therefore
your
time
spent
in
the
amusement
park
is
meaningless
it
has
no
eternal
consequences
to
you
nor
to
anyone
left
on
earth
but
then
you
contradict
yourself
from
a
previous
post
you
said
doing
evil
things
is
bad
to
you
it
shouldnt
matter
if
you
do
evil
things
or
good
things
it
is
all
meaningless
in
the
end
anyway
so
go
rob
a
bank
go
tell
someone
you
dislike
that
he
is
a
dirty
rotten
slime
bag
whats
restraining
you
life
after
all
has
no
eternal
consequences
and
accountability
is
irrelevant
in
the
same
way
i
think
life
is
fun
and
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
amusement
park
of
life
until
they
close
down
for
the
night
d
at
which
time
you
are
truly
not
the
master
of
yourself
im
sorry
i
dont
feel
that
sacrificing
jesus
was
something
any
god
id
worship
would
do
unless
the
sacrifice
was
only
temporary
in
which
case
its
not
really
all
that
important
has
the
resurrection
sunk
in
jesus
is
alive
jesus
is
not
dead
so
you
and
your
holy
book
say
by
the
same
token
therefore
santa
claus
delivers
toys
every
xmas
dont
you
see
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
what
you
say
is
true
please
give
me
some
reason
that
i
cant
similarly
apply
to
santa
claus
you
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
what
jesus
says
and
the
witnesses
of
jesus
say
are
true
but
you
choose
to
be
unreasonable
and
ignore
the
reasons
by
definition
ignorance
santa
claus
is
said
to
live
at
the
north
pole
and
have
a
squad
of
elves
and
flying
reindeer
ever
see
a
flying
reindeer
has
anyone
in
human
history
seen
a
flying
reindeer
has
anyone
seen
a
reindeer
whose
nose
blinks
red
on
the
other
hand
are
people
born
in
bethlehem
was
nebuchandezzar
really
a
king
was
daniel
really
one
of
his
court
officials
were
david
and
solomon
really
kings
of
israel
and
judah
was
their
really
a
king
called
jehoachin
did
sennecherib
really
attack
jerusalem
years
before
christ
did
sennacherib
really
lose
his
battleand
badly
was
there
really
a
caiaphas
who
interrogated
jesus
yes
yes
yes
history
verifies
it
it
is
nonfiction
do
you
have
a
problem
discerning
truth
from
fiction
perhaps
you
cant
evaluate
the
context
of
grimms
fairy
tales
apart
from
that
of
the
scientific
american
i
suppose
you
treat
both
with
equal
truthfulness
or
equal
falsity
is
this
what
you
are
telling
me
or
is
it
that
just
do
want
to
read
the
scientific
american
and
find
out
that
its
not
a
fairy
tale
are
you
thereby
inferring
that
your
deity
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
verses
in
a
book
and
cannot
be
supported
without
invoking
them
get
real
have
you
ever
been
to
zaire
do
you
have
to
go
there
to
be
assured
that
there
really
is
such
a
place
given
your
irrationality
i
take
it
you
have
never
used
a
map
in
your
life
why
do
you
believe
what
you
believe
given
the
overwhelming
evidence
as
well
as
my
personal
experience
with
the
living
god
id
be
an
irrational
unreasoning
ignorant
fool
if
i
didnt
follow
jesus
subject
the
law
of
retribution
the
law
of
retribution
violent
crime
racism
bigotry
domestic
abuse
rape
police
brutality
and
oppression
human
rights
violations
etc
etc
continue
to
get
worse
and
worse
in
spite
of
more
and
more
manmade
laws
on
all
levels
from
local
ordinances
to
international
law
the
manmade
laws
are
not
working
what
we
have
here
is
failure
to
communicate
perpetrators
remain
ignorant
of
the
lawa
universal
cosmic
and
spiritual
lawthe
law
of
retribution
or

be
not

with

here
is
the
patience
and
faith
of
the
saints
revelation
kjv
what
goes
around
comes
around
this
law
of
the
universe
is
just
as
real
as
the
physical
law
that
for
every
action
there
is
an
equal

opposite

it
is
the
enforcement
the
teeth
behind
the
golden
rule
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
all
perpetrators
in
the
present
will
become
victims
in
the
future
most
likely
in
a
future
incarnation
most
victims
in
the
present
were
perpetrators
in
the
past
usually
during
a
previous
life
what
is
needed
is
a
massive
worldwide
program
of
education
to
teach
all
present
and
potential
perpetrators
in
a
convincing
manner
with
sufficient
supporting
evidence
that
what
they
do
to
others
will
be
done
to
them
in
this
life
or
the
next
anyone
who
doubts
the
fact
of
reincarnation
and
the
related
law
of
retribution
should
read
books
such
as
here

hereafter
by
ruth
montgomery
which
describes
several
kinds
of
evidence
supporting
reincarnation
including
hypnotic
regression
to
past
lives
about
accurate
the
subconscious
mind
can
sometimes
make
things
up
especially
with
a
bad
hypnotist
spontaneous
recall
especially
by
young
children
some
of
whom
can
identify
their
most
recent
previous
relatives
homes
possessions

dream
recall
of
past
life
experiences
deja

while
traveling
there
for
the

the
psychic
readings
of
the

cayce
and
even
supporting

from

bible
including
matthew

was
the
reincarnation
of

john
how
can
a
person
possibly
sin
before
he
is
born
unless
he
lived
before
strong
interests
innate
talents
strong
phobias
etc
typically
originate
from
a
persons
past
lives
for
example
a
strong
fear
of
swimming
in
or
traveling
over
water
usually
results
from
having
drowned
at
the
end
of
a
previous
life
and
sometimes
a
person
will
take
an
immediate
dislike
to
another
person
being
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
present
life
because
of
a
bad
encounter
with
him
during
a
previous
incarnation
people
would
behave
much
better
toward
each
other
if
they
knew
that
their
actions
in
the
present
will
surely
be
reaped
by
them
in
the

can
we

christian
morality
is
in
my
mind
to
say
that
science
has
its
basis
in
values
is
a
bit
of
a
reach
science
has
its

in
observable
fact
id
say
that
what
one
chooses
to
observe
and
how
the
observation
is
interpreted
and
what
significance
its
given
depends
a
great
deal
on
the
values
of
the
observer
science
is
a
human
activity
and
as
such
is
subject
to
the
same
potential
for
distortion
as
any
other
human
activity
the
myth
that
scientists
are
above
moral
influence
or
ethical
concern
that
their
knowledge
can
be
abstacted
whole
and
pure
from
nature
untainted
by
the
biases
of
the
scientist
is
nonsense
bill
if
one
is
to
argue
for
objective
values
in
a
moral
sense
then
one
must
first
start
by
demonstrating
that
morality
itself
is
objective
considering
the
meaning
of
the
word
objective
i
doubt
that
this
will
ever
happen
so
back
to
the
original
question
and
objective
morality
is
this
may
be
an
unfortunate
choice
of
words
almost
selfcontradictory
objective
in
the
sense
used
here
means
something
immutable
and
absolute
while
morality
describes
the
behavior
of
some
group
of
people
the
first
term
is
all
inclusive
the
second
is
specific
the
concept
supposedly
described
may
have
meaning
however
if
there
is
a
god
as
described
by
the
christians
for
instance
then
he
has
existence
apart
from
and
independent
of
humankind
his
existence
is
outside
of
our
frame
of
reference
reality
if
this
being
declares
a
thing
to
be
so
it
is
necessarily
so
since
he
has
defined
himself
as
omnipotent
and
if
his
claims
are
to
be
believed
he
is
at
least
omnipotent
relative
to
us
god
is
intrinsically
selfdefined
and
all
reality
is
whatever
he
says
it
is
in
an
objective
sense
if
god
determines
a
standard
of
conduct
that
standard
is
objective
if
human
beings
are
held
accountable
for
their
conformance
to
that
standard
while
permitted
to
ignore
it
they
substitute
a
relative
morality
or
mode
of
conduct
giving
the
term
morality
a
nebulous
meaningless
sense
that
can
be
argued
about
by
those
pretending
to
misunderstand
the
standard
is
objective
and
the
conduct
required
to
meet
that
standard
is
therefore
objectively
determined
just
because
it
is
convenient
to
pretend
that
the
term
morality
is
infinitely
malleable
doesnt
mean
that
the
objective
standard
itself
doesnt
exist
morality
has
come
to
mean
little
more
than
a
cultural
norm
or
the
preferred
conduct
of
decent
people
making
it
seem
subjective
but
it
is
derived
from
an
absolute
objective
standard
ironically
this
objective
standard
is
in
perfect
accord
with
our
true
nature
according
to
christianity
at
least
yet
is
condemned
as
being
contrary
to
human
nre
oppressive
and
severe
this
may
be
due
as
bill
much

our
amoral
inclinations

to
the

my

imperfect
whatever

no

those

he
and
many
of
his

were
flaming
homosexuals
well
know
also
for
their
flamboyant
orgies
i
have
been
trying
to
find
if
there
is
any
actual
evidence
for
this
common
assertion
recently
postings
to
such
groups
as
sochistory
and
socculturegerman
has
not
uncovered
any
netexperts
who
could
provide
any
well
im
no
expert
but
all
of
the
histories
of
nazi
germany
assert
this
they
make
reference
to
several
scandals
that
occurred
long
before
the
night
of
the
long
knives
the
impression
that
i
got
was
that
homosexuality
in
portions
of
the
sa
was
common
knowledge
also
a
book
by
a
homosexual
author
whose
name
escapes
me
at
the
moment
called
homosexuals
in
history
asserts
that
roehm
and
heines
were
homosexuals
as
well
as
others
in
roehms
sa
circle
all
the
books
say
that
roehm
and
his
associate
edmund
heines
were
homosexual
i
have
been
able
to
find
nothing
beyond
that
and
suspect
this
to
be
a
sort
of
historical
urban
legend
well
youre
the
one
who
is
in
germany
if
you
dont
believe
the
history
books
look
up
the
primary
sources
yourself
those
of
us
outside
of
germany
do
not
have
access
to
these
you
do
it
seems
to
me
that
there
were
plenty
of
documented
instances
several
scandals
the
fact
that
on
the
knight
of
the
long
knives
several
sa
members
including
heines
were
found
sleeping
together
etc
also
i
believe
some
people
were
complaining
about
the
sas
homosexual
activities
seducing
young
boys
etc
the
histories
that
ive
read
make
a
very
convincing
case
none
of
this
sounds
like
urban
legend
to
me
irving
a
notoriously
unreliable
historian
says
that
funk
the
nazi
finance
minister
was
homosexual
he
gives
no
sources
i
know
next
to
nothing
about
irving
and
nothing
about
funk
what
precisely
do
you
know
that
would
contradict
all
of
the
other
history
books
that
i
have
read
concerning
the
existence
of
homosexual
nazis
are
you
trying
to
say
that
all
historians
are
taking
part
in
an
antihomosexual
smear
what
about
homosexual
writers
who
agree
with
the
official
history
dont
you
think
they
would
have
found
out
the
truth
by
now
if
roehm
and
heines
were
not
homosexuals
i
would
think
they
would
want
to
disassociate
homosexuality
from
nazism
no
one
should
use
any
connection
between
the
two
to
bash
homosexuals
in
any
case
i
challenge
anyone
to
document
this
claim
if
you
are
going
to
challenge
all
historians
on
this
point
not
just
irving
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
you
track
down
the
references
find
out
where
the
stories
originate
from
again
you
are
the
one
in
germany
close
to
archival
material
most
people
on
the
net
are
not
i
have
found
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
there
were
many
flaming
heterosexuals
among
the
nazis
this
seems
to
include
all
of
the
worst
oneshitler
himmler
goebbels
goering
heydrich
eichmann
and
many
more
eh
what
is
your
agenda
here
to
prove
that
the
nazis
were
heterosexuals
so
that
you
can
bash
heterosexuals
does
it
bother
you
that
some
of
the
nazis
might
have
been
homosexuals
does
this
make
all
homosexuals
bad
if
this
is
true
of
course
not
and
what
about
bisexuals
are
they
halfnazis
i
dont
know
why
it
would
be
so
difficult
to
believe
that
some
nazis
were
homosexuals
the
german
officer
corps
before
for
instance
was
notorious
for
its
homosexuality
there
were
numerous
scandals
which
rocked
the
german
govt
during
the
late
and
early
century
many
of
the
kaisers
friends
were
prosecuted
the
kaiser
was
no
homosexual
but
the
germany
army
had
a
long
tradition
of
tolerating
homosexuality
going
far
back
into
prussian
history
back
to
frederick
the
great
at
least
who
was
himself
a
homosexual
roehm
was
a
product
of
this
prussian
officer
tradition
and
the
old
german
army
like
the
english
public
school
system
being
a
well
known
center
of
homosexuality
would
have
been
quite
willing
to
overlook
roehms
homosexuality
in
addition
some
nazis
complained
of
homosexuality
in
the
hitler
youth
the
hitler
youth
swallowed
up
all
prenazi
youth
groups
and
some
of
the
various
prewar
vandervogel
bund
and
volkish
youth
groups
were
known
to
promote
homoerotic
ideals
and
friendship
and
in
many
cases
homosexuality
itself
so
it
seems
to
me
not
unlikely
that
there
were
plenty
of
homosexual
nazis
regardless
of
the
official
nazi
dogmas
concerning
the
evils
of
homosexuality
why
should
this
suprise
anyone
homosexuality
has
always
existed
in
all
societies
it
would
be
most
unusual
if
the
nazis
were
an
exception
no

any

decayed
to

too
brian
why
another
excuse
mr
ceccarelli
you
seem
to
be
stating
that
we
must
accept
accept
everything
written
in
every
historical
document
somehow
i
doubt
do
that
yourself
that
thus
since
i
doubt
you
accept
everything
written
in
every
historical
document
i
would
ask
how
you
can
thereby
objectively
justify
complete
faith
in
the
words
of
the
books
attributed
to
peter
i
shall
now
give
an
example
of
a
document
from
antiquity
which
i
am
sure
you
reject
it
dates
from
the
time
of
ramses
ii
this
was
first
presented
here
by
matthew
wiener
these
inscriptions
were
carved
soon
after
a
battle
and
were
carved
with
the
pharoahs
specific
approval
so
we
have
true
originals
rather
than
mere
copies
this
account
records
the
the
battle
of
kadesh
circa
bc
which
occurred
on
the
river
orontes
about
miles
south
of
aleppo
the
egyptians
won
this
battle
with
the
hittites
and
ramses
had
his
victory
inscribed
all
over
the
place
a
few
of
of
these
inscriptions
have
survived
in
near
perfect
form
it
is
a
record
of
how
the
pharoah
pretty
much
singlehandedly
defeated
the
hittites
after
being
separated
from
his
troops
note
that
the
egyptian
wavers
back
and
forth
between
first
and
third
person
the
following
is
from
miriam
lichtheims
ancient
egyptian
literature
volume
ii
my
majesty
caused
the
forces
of
the
foes
from
hitti
to
fall
on
their
faces
one
upon
the
other
as
crocodiles
fall
into
the
water
of
the
orontes
i
was
after
them
like
a
griffin
i
attacked
all
the
countries
i
alone
for
my
infantry
and
my
chariotry
had
deserted
me
not
one
of
them
stood
looking
back
as
i
live
as
ra
loves
me
as
my
father
atum
favors
me
everything
that
my
majesty
has
told
i
did
it
in
truth
in
the
presence
of
my
infantry
and
my
chariotry
note
this
paragraph
records
not
only
ramses
divine
word
but
also
that
there
were
thousands
of
witnesses
to
the
event
now
from
the
heart
of
battle
then
his
majesty
drove
at
a
gallop
and
charged
the
forces
of
the
foe
from
hitti
being
alone
by
himself
none
other
with
him
his
majesty
proceeded
to
look
about
him
and
found
chariots
ringing
him
on
his
way
out
no
officer
was
with
me
no
charioteer
no
soldier
of
the
army
no
shieldbearer
my
infantry
my
chariotry
yielded
before
them
not
one
of
them
stood
firm
to
fight
with
them
his
majesty
spoke
what
is
this
father
amun
is
it
right
for
a
father
to
ignore
his
son
are
my
deeds
a
matter
for
you
to
ignore
do
i
not
walk
and
stand
at
your
word
i
have
not
neglected
an
order
you
gave
too
great
is
he
the
great
lord
of
egypt
to
allow
aliens
to
step
on
his
path
what
are
these
asiatics
to
you
o
amun
the
wretches
ignorant
of
god
have
i
not
made
for
you
many
great
monuments
i
call
to
you
my
father
amun
i
am
among
a
host
of
strangers
all
countries
are
arrayed
against
me
i
am
alone
theres
none
with
me
the
labors
of
many
people
are
nothing
amun
is
more
helpful
than
they
i
came
here
by
the
command
of
your
mouth
o
amun
i
have
not
transgressed
your
command
now
though
i
prayed
in
a
distant
land
my
voice
resounded
in
southern
thebes
i
found
amun
came
when
i
called
to
him
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
i
rejoiced
he
called
from
behind
as
if
near
by
forward
i
am
with
you
i
your
father
my
hand
is
with
you
i
prevail
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
i
am
lord
of
victory
lover
of
valor
i
found
my
heart
stout
my
breast
in
joy
all
i
did
succeeded
i
was
like
mont
i
slaughtered
among
them
at
my
will
not
one
looked
behind
him
not
one
turned
around
whoever
fell
down
did
not
rise
one
called
out
to
the
other
saying
no
man
is
he
who
is
among
us
it
is
seth
greatofstrength
baal
in
person
not
deeds
of
man
are
these
his
doings
they
are
of
one
who
is
unique
who
fights
a
hundred
thousand
without
soldiers
and
chariots
come
quick
flee
before
him
to
seek
life
and
breathe
air
for
he
who
attempts
to
get
close
to
him
his
hands
all
his
limbs
grow
limp
one
cannot
hold
either
bow
or
spears
when
one
sees
him
come
racing
along
my
majesty
hunted
them
like
a
griffin
i
slaughtered
among
them
unceasingly
so
you
see
brian
we
have
a
few
original
manuscripts
recording
the
miraculous
battle
between
the
ramses
and
the
hittites
do
you
reject
them
as
being
completely
true
i
suspect
you
do
and
if
so
then
do
you
also
in
your
own
words
question
the
existence
of
alexander
the
great
tilgrath
pilisar
iii
nero
caligula
josephus
cyrus
the
great
artexerxes
do
you
also
thereby
question
all
their
documents
thats
the
problem
with
your
all
or
nothing
approach
many
ancient
people
used
to
mix
a
bit
of
fancy
with
their
facts
so
for
you
to
say
that
we
must
either
accept
all
of
peter
and
the
rest
of
the
new
testament
or
accept
no
records
of
antiquity
at
all
forces
you
thereby
to
accept
the
verity
of
documents
you
probably
do
not
find
completely
credible
as
to
your
other
argument
that
so
many
people
have
testified
to
jesus
that
he
must
be
true
are
you
going
to
just
pass
off
all
this
testimony
as
fictiousness
are
you
going
to
call
three
thousand
years
worth
of
testimony
from
shepherds
to
irs
agents
to
royal
officials
to
kings
to
computer
programmers
fiction
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complete
ignorance
of
the
testimonies
are
you
going
to
say
that
that
is
all
complete
hooey
would
that
not
be
the
most
audacious
display
of
arrogance
do
you
actually
think
you
know
better
than
king
solomon
king
david
or
even
abraham
lincoln
i
have
three
points
first
this
is
argumentum
ad
populum
ie
appeal
to
popular
opinion
you
cannot
vote
on
truth
for
instance
do
the
millions
of
hindus
past
and
present
who
testify
to
the
reality
of
brahma
constitute
actual
evidence
for
the
existence
of
brahma
how
would
you
answer
your
own
question
in
regards
to
the
testimony
of
hindus
with
a
scoff
of
your
keyboard
with
near
complete
ignorance
of
the
testimonies
are
you
going
to
say
that
that
is
all
complete
hooey
if
you
do
so
scoff
then
how
do
you
objectively
justify
your
own
special
pleading
second
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
king
solomon
or
king
david
testified
to
jesus
you
can
claim
it
to
be
clear
but
that
does
not
make
it
true
third
it
is
quite
arguable
that
abraham
lincoln
was
not
christian
and
that
he
had
both
a
public
and
a
private
view
of
christianity
in
fact
there
was
much
discussion
about
it
in
his
day
yes
he
was
publically
accused
of
being
a
deist
oh
my
i
am
presently
collecting
a
faq
for
lincoln
as
ive
previously
done
for
tyre
jefferson
and
etc
later
dave
butler
my
earlier
views
of
the
unsoundness
of
the
christian
scheme
of
salvation
and
the
human
origin
of
the
scriptures
have
become
clearer
and
stronger
with
advancing
years
and
i
see
no
reason
for
thinking
i
shall
ever
change
them

theory
in
which
all

can
be
explained
with
a
single
set
of
laws
or
equations
but
they
have
been
systematically
ignoring
or
suppressing
an
excellent
one
for
years
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
which
he
calls
the
reciprocal
system
is
built
on
two
fundamental
postulates
about
the
physical
and
mathematical
natures
of
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
in
two
reciprocal
forms
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
developed
a
complete
theoretical
universe
using
various
combinations
of
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
vibrational
rotational
motions
the
concepts
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
and
speeds
in
relation
to
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
called
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
at
each
step
in
the
development
larson

and
applying

theory
to

of

larson
was
able
to
precisely
and
accurately
calculate
inter
atomic
distances
in

and
molecules
compressibility
and
thermal
expansion
of

larsons
background
physicist
dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
chemical
or
electrical
he
was
about
years
old
when
he
died
in
may
he
had
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
while
trying
to
develop
a
way
to
compute
chemical
properties
based
only
on
the
elements
used
larsons
lack
of
a
fancy
phd
degree
might
be
one
reason
that
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
him
but
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
sometimes
it
takes
a
relative
outsider
to
clearly
see
the
forest
through
the
trees
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
from
his
books
that
he
also
knew
orthodox
physics
and
astronomy
as
well
as
any
physicist
or
astronomer
well
enough
to
point
out
all
their
contradictions
ad
hoc
assumptions
principles
of
impotence
inconsistencies
etc
larson
did
not
have
the
funds
etc
to
experimentally
test
his
theory
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
he
simply
compared
the
various
parts
of
his
theory
with
other
researchers
experimental
and
observational
data
and
in
many
cases
his
explanation
fit
better
a
selfconsistent
theory
is
much
more
than
the
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
have
they
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
that
works
but
have
been
ignoring
one
for
over
years
now
modern
physics
does
not
explain
the
physical
universe
so
well
some
parts
of
some
of
larsons
books
are
full
of
quotations
of
leading
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
who
agree
and
remember
that
epicycles
crystal
spheres
geocentricity
flat
earth
theory
etc
also
once
seemed
to
explain
it
well
but
were
later
proved
conceptually
wrong

super
collider
boondoggle
i
am
against
contruction
of
the
superconducting
super
collider
in
texas
or
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
gross
waste
of
money
and
contribute
almost
nothing
of
scientific
value
most
physicists
dont
realize
it
but
according
to
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
as
described
in
his
books
the
strange
goofy
particles
mesons
hyperons
alleged
quarks
etc
which
they
are
finding
in
existing
colliders
fermi
lab
cern
etc
are
really
just
atoms
of
antimatter
which
are
created
by
the
highenergy
colliding
beams
and
which
quickly
disintegrate
like
cosmic
rays
because
they
are
incompatible
with
their
environment
a
larger
and
more
expensive
collider
will
only
create
a
few
more
elements
of
antimatter
that
the
physicists
have
not
seen
there
before
and
the
physicists
will
be
even
more
confused
than
they
are
now
are
a
few
more
types
of
antimatter
atoms
worth
the
billion
cost
dont
we
have
much
more
important
uses
for
this
wasted
money
another
thing
to
consider
is
that
the
primary
proposed
location
in
texas
has
a
serious
and
growing
problem
with
some
kind
of
fire
ants
eating
the
insulation
off
underground
cables
how
much
poisoning
of
the
ground
and
ground
water
with
insecticides
will
be
required
to
keep
the
ants
out
of
the
supercollider
naming
the
super
collider
after
ronald
reagon
as
proposed
is
totally
absurd
if
it
is
built
it
should
be
named
after
a
leading
particle
physicist
larsonian
antimatter
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
antimatter
is
not
a
simple
case
of
opposite
charges
of
the
same
types
of
particles
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
rates
of
vibrations
and
rotations
of
the
photons
of
which
they
are
made
in
relation
to
the
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
of
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
calls
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
in
larsons
theory
a
positron
is

of

the

of
the

has
been
observed
and
precisely
measured
to
advance
at
the
rate
of
seconds
of

per
century
seconds
of
this
advance
are
attributed
via
calculations
to
gravitational
perturbations
from
the
other
planets
venus
earth
jupiter
etc
the
remaining
seconds
of
arc
are
being
used
to
help
prove
einsteins
general
theory
of
relativity
but
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
achieved
results
closer
to
the
seconds
than
general
relativity
can
by
instead
using
special
relativity
in
one
or
more
of
his
books
he
applied
the
lorentz
transformation
on
the
high
orbital
speed
of
mercury
larson
totally
rejected
general
relativity
as
another
mathematical
fantasy
he
also
rejected
most
of
special
relativity
including
the
parts
about
mass
increases
near
the
speed
of
light
and
the
use
of
the
lorentz
transform
on
doppler
shifts
those
quasars
with
redshifts
greater
than
really
are
moving
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
motion
is
away
from
us
in
time
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
there
are
three
dimensions
of
time
instead
of
only
one
but
two
of
those
dimensions
can
not
be
measured
from
our
material
half
of
the
physical
universe
the
one
dimension
that
we
can
measure
is
the
clock
time
at
low
relative
speeds
the
values
of
the
other
two
dimensions
are
negligible
but
at
high
speeds
they
become
significant
and
the
lorentz
transformation
must
be
used
as
a
fudge
factor
larson
often
used
the
term
coordinate
time
when
writing
about
this
in
regard
to
mass
increases
it
has
been
proven
in
atomic
accelerators
that
acceleration
drops
toward
zero
near
the
speed
of
light
but
the
formula
for
acceleration
is
acceleration
force
mass
a
fm
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
the
third
factor
force
in
larsons
theory
mass
stays
constant
and
force
drops
toward
zero
force
is
actually
a
motion
or
combinations
of
motions
or
relations
between
motions
including
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
the
expansion
of
the
universe
for
example
is
an
outward
scalar
motion
inherent
in
the
universe
and
not
a
result
of
the
socalled
big
bang
which
is
yet
another
mathematical

i
wish
to
recommend
to
everyone
the
book
the
universe
of
motion
by
dewey
b
larson
north
pacific
publishers
po
box
portland
oregon
pages
indexed
hardcover
it
contains
the
astrophysical
portions
of
a
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
that
author
an
unrecognized
genius
more
than
thirty
years
ago
it
contains
final
solutions
to
most
all
astrophysical
mysteries
including
the
formation
of
galaxies
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
the
true
origin
of
the
background
radiation
cosmic
rays
and
gamma
ray
bursts
and
the
true
nature
of
quasars
pulsars
white
dwarfs
exploding
galaxies
etc
it
contains
what
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
are
all
looking
for
if
they
are
ready
to
seriously
consider
it
with
open
minds
the
following
is
an
example
of
his
theorys
success
in
his
first
book
in
the
structure
of
the
physical
universe
larson
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
larsons
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
an
immediate
related
explanation
for
them
also
gammaray
bursts
astrophysicists
and
astronomers
are
still
scratching
their
heads
about
the
mysterious
gammaray
bursts
they
were
originally
thought
to
originate
from
neutron
stars
in
the
disc
of
our
galaxy
but
the
new
gamma
ray
telescope
now
in
earth
orbit
has
been
detecting
them
in
all
directions
uniformly
and
their
source
locations
in
space
do
not
correspond
to
any
known
objects
except
for
a
few
cases
of
directional
coincidence
gammaray
bursts
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
according
to
page
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
published
in
the
gammaray
bursts
are
coming
from
supernova
explosions
in
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
which
larson
calls
the
cosmic
sector
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
antimatter
and
material
halves
of
the
physical
universe
and
the
way
they
are
connected
together
the
gammaray
bursts
can
pop
into
our
material
half
anywhere
in
space
seemingly
at
random
this
is
why
the
source
locations
of
the
bursts
do
not
correspond
with
known
objects
and
come
from
all
directions
uniformly
i
wonder
how
close
to
us
in
space
a
source
location
would
have
to
be
for
a
gammaray
burst
to
kill
all
or
most
life
on
earth
there
would
be
no
way
to
predict
one
nor
to
stop
it
perhaps
some
of
the
mass
extinctions
of
the
past
which
are
now
being
blamed
on
impacts
of
comets
and
asteroids
were
actually
caused
by
nearby
gammaray
bursts
larsonian
binary
star
formation
about
half
of
all
the
stars
in
the
galaxy
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sun
are
binary
or
double
but
orthodox
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
still
have
no
satisfactory
theory
about
how
they
form
or
why
there
are
so
many
of
them
but
binary
star
systems
are
actually
a
likely
consequence
of
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
i
will
try
to
summarize
larsons
explanation
which
is
detailed
in
chapter
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
and
in
some
of
his
other
books
first
of
all
according
to
larson
stars
do
not
generate
energy
by
fusion
a
small
fraction
comes
from
slow
gravitational
collapse
the
rest
results
from
the
complete
annihilation
of
heavy
elements
heavier
than
iron
each
element
has
a
destructive
temperature
limit
the
heavier
the
element
is
the
lower
is
this
limit
a
stars
internal
temperature
increases
as
it
grows
in
mass
via
accretion
and
absorption
of
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
gradually
reaching
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
lighter
and
lighter
elements
when
the
internal
temperature
of
the
star
reaches
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
iron
there
is
a
type
i
supernova
explosion
this
is
because
there
is
so
much
iron
present
and
that
is
related
to
the
structure
of
iron
atoms
and
the
atom
building
process
which
larson
explains
in
some
of
his
books
better
than
i
can
when
the
star
explodes
the
lighter
material
on
the
outer
portion
of
the
star
is
blown
outward
in
space
at
less
than
the
speed
of
light
the
heavier
material
in
the
center
portion
of
the
star
was
already
bouncing
around
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
because
of
the
high
temperature
the
explosion
pushes
that
material
over
the
speed
of
light
and
it
expands
outward
in
time
which
is
equivalent
to
inward
in
space
and
it
often
actually
disappears
for
a
while
over
long
periods
of
time
both
masses
start
to
fall
back
gravitationally
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
space
now
starts
to
form
a
red
giant
star
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
time
starts
to
form
a
white
dwarf
star
both
stars
then
start
moving
back
toward
the
main
sequence
from
opposite
directions
on
the
hr
diagram
the
chances
of
the
two
masses
falling
back
into
the
exact
same
location
in
space
making
a
single
lone
star
again
are
near
zero
they
will
instead
form
a
binary
system
orbiting
each
other
according
to
larson
a
white
dwarf
star
has
an
inverse
density
gradient
is
densest
at
its
surface
because
the
material
at
its
center
is
most
widely
dispersed
blown
outward
in
time
this
eliminates
the
need
to
resort
to
mathematical
fantasies
about
degenerate
matter
neutron
stars
black
holes
etc
larsonian
solar
system
formation
if
the
mass
of
the
heavy
material
at
the
center
of
the
exploding
star
is
relatively
small
then
instead
of
a
single
white
dwarf
star
there
will
be
several
mini
white
dwarf
stars
revolving
around
the
red
giant
star
but
probably
still
too
far
away
in
threedimensional
time
to
be
affected
by
its
heat
etc
these
will
become
planets
in
chapter
of
the
universe
of
motion
larson
used
all
this
information
and
other
principles
of
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
to
derive
his
own
version
of
bodes
law
black
hole
fantasy
i
heard
that
physicist
stephen
w
hawking
recently
completed
a
theoretical
mathematical
analysis
of
two
black
holes
merging
together
into
a
single
black
hole
and
concluded
that
the
new
black
hole
would
have
more
mass
than
the
sum
of
the
two
original
black
holes
such
a
result
should
be
recognized
by
everyone
as
a
red
flag
causing
widespread
doubt
about
the
whole
idea
of
black
holes
etc
after
reading
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
books
about
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
especially
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
it
is
clear
to
me
that
black
holes
are
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
the
strange
object
at
cygnus
is
just
an
unusually
massive
white
dwarf
star
not
the
black
hole
that
orthodox
astronomers
and
physicists
so
badly
want
to
prove
their
theory
by
the
way
i
do
not
understand
why
so
much
publicity
is
being
given
to
physicist
stephen
hawking
the
physicists
and
astronomers
seem
to
be
acting
as
if
hawkings
severe
physical
problem
somehow
makes
him
wiser
it
does
not
i
wish
the
same
attention
had
been
given
to
physicist
dewey
b
larson
while
he
was
still
alive
widespread
publicity
and
attention
should
now
be
given
to
larsons
theory
books
and
organization
the
international
society
of
unified
science
electromagnetic
propulsion
i
heard
of
that
concept
many
years
ago
in
connection
with
ufos
and
unorthodox
inventors
but
i
never
was
able
to
find
out
how
or
why
they
work
or
how
they
are
constructed
i
found
a
possible
clue
about
why
they
might
work
on
pages
of
the
book
basic
properties
of
matter
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
which
describes
part
of
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
i
quote
one
paragraph
as
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
universe
of
motion
arrives
at
a
totally
different
concept
of
the
nature
of
electrical
resistance
the
electrons
we
find
are
derived
from
the
environment
it
was
brought
out
in
volume
i
larsons
book
nothing
but
motion
that
there
are
physical
processes
in
operation
which
produce
electrons
in
substantial
quantities
and
that
although
the
motions
that
constitute
these
electrons
are
in
many
cases
absorbed
by
atomic
structures
the
opportunities
for
utilizing
this
type
of
motion
in
such
structures
are
limited
it
follows
that
there
is
always
a
large
excess
of
free
electrons
in
the
material
sector
material
half
of
the
universe
most
of
which
are
uncharged
in
this
uncharged
state
the
electrons
cannot
move
with
respect
to
extension
space
because
they
are
inherently
rotating
units
of
space
and
the
relation
of
space
to
space
is
not
motion
in
open
space
therefore
each
uncharged
electron
remains
permanently
in
the
same
location
with
respect
to
the
natural
reference
system
in
the
manner
of
a
photon
in
the
context
of
the
stationary
spatial
reference
system
the
uncharged
electron
like
the
photon
is
carried
outward
at
the
speed
of
light
by
the
progression
of
the
natural
reference
system
all
material
aggregates
are
thus
exposed
to
a
flux
of
electrons
similar
to
the
continual
bombardment
by
photons
of
radiation
meanwhile
there
are
other
processes
to
be
discussed
later
whereby
electrons
are
returned
to
the
environment
the
electron
population
of
a
material
aggregate
such
as
the
earth
therefore
stabilizes
at
an
equilibrium
level
note
that
in
larsons
theory
uncharged
electrons
are
also
massless
and
are
basically
photons
of
light
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
spinning
around
one
axis
at
a
particular
rate
below
the
unit
rate
unit
velocity
is
the
speed
of
light
and
there
are
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
to
the
speed
of
light
according
to
larsons
theory
i
might
have
the
above
and
below
labels
mixed
up
larson
is
saying
that
outer
space
is
filled
with
mass
less
uncharged
electrons
flying
around
at
the
speed
of
light
if
this
is
true
then
the
electromagnetic
propulsion
fields
of
spacecraft
might
be
able
to
interact
with
these
electrons
or
other
particles
in
space
perhaps
giving
them
a
charge
and
mass
and
shooting
them
toward
the
rear
to
achieve
propulsion
in
larsons
theory
an
electrical
charge
is
a
onedimensional
rotational
vibration
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
superimposed
on
the
rotation
of
the
particle
the
paragraph
quoted
above
might
also
give
a
clue
to
confused
meteorologists
about
how
and
why
lightning
is
generated
in
clouds

these
particular
tibetans
are
advocating
increased
violence
against
the
chinese
occupiers
are
they
wrong
wrong
about
what
i
think
they
are
correct
in
thinking
that
a
wellplaced
bomb
or
six
would
get
headlines
but
i
think
they
are
wrong
if
they
think
that
you
can
set
off
bombs
and
still
be
a
buddhist
maybe
what
we
are
seeing
here
is
that
chinese
cultural
genocide
against
the
tibetans
has
worked
well
enough
that
some
tibetans
are
now
no
longer
buddhist
and
are
instead
willing
to
behave
like
the
chinese
occupiers
every
action
is
its
own
reward
clearly
the
occupation
of
tibet
has
been
largely
ignored
on
the
other
hand
people
who
are
aware
of
the
occupation
are
mostly
full
of
admiration
for
the
peaceful
way
that
tibetans
have
put
up
with
it
and
what
does
it
cost
us
to
admire
them
zip
are
tibetans
currently
people
of
peace
do
they
serve
themselves
well
or
badly
by
being
so
yes
they
are
and
whether
this
serves
them
well
or
not
depends
on
whether
they
want
buddhist
principles
or
political
independence
and
without
political
independence
can
they
preserve
their
cultural
and
religious
traditions
would
an
increased
level
of
violence
make
them
terrorists
the
chinese
would
certainly
refer
to
them
as
terrorists
just
as
the
hitler
regime
used
to
refer
to
european
resistance
movements
as
terrorists
assuming
that
the
group
advocating
this
course
is
correct
and
greater
attention
is
focussed
on
the
occupation
of
tibet
by
the
chinese
are
the
tibetans
better
off
as
people
of
peace
or
as
terrorists
better
off
in
what
way
as
proponents
of
pacifism
or
as
proponents
of
political
autonomy
and
better
off
in
what
timescale
the
soviet
empire
practised
cultural
genocide
against
something
like
a
hundred
small
minorities
some
of
which
resisted
violently
and
some
of
which
did
not
but
in
the
end
it
was
the
soviet
empire
that
collapsed
and
at
least
some
of
the
minorities
survived
now
some
of
the
minorities
are
fighting
one
another
is
that
because
they
have
to
or
because
violent
resistance
to
an
oppressive
empire
legitimized
violence

a
babys
innocence
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
baby
is
a
sinner
innocence
and
the
sin
nature
are
two
different
attributes
the
baby
is
innocent
yet
the
baby
is
a
sinner
you
have
two
arms
and
two
legs
why
because
your
parents
did
why
because
their
parents
did
etc
did
you
do
anything
to
get
them
the
thing
is
i
know
what
arms
and
legs
are
its
therefore
generally
easy
to
tell
whether
or
not
someone
has
arms
and
legs
this
sinful
nature
since
it
does
not
require
that
the
baby
actually
perform
any
sins
seems
to
be
totally
invisible
as
far
as
i
know
maybe
half
the
babies
have
a
sinful
nature
and
half
dontitd
look
exactly
the
same
since
there
is
no
way
to
tell
the
difference
we
are
born
sinners
we
are
born
sinners
because
our
parents
were
born
with
it
we
got
it
from
them
we
did
nothing
to
earn
the
title
sinner
we
get
it
because
our
parents
had
it
their
parents
had
it
their
grandparents
had
it
etc
infinitum
so
whats
so
bad
about
a
sinful
nature
then
i
could
understand
it
being
bad
if
it
always
results
in
people
committing
sins
but
babies
can
have
it
never
commit
sins
die
and
they
still
have
it
so
the
bad
part
about
cant
merely
be
that
it
results
in
people
committing
sinsso
what
is
bad
about

i
wasnt

post
this

i
guess
the
misc
is
there
for
a
reason
here
goes
i
am
getting
married
in
june
to
a
devout
wisconsin
synod
lutheran
i
would
classify
myself
as
a
strong

athiest
this
has
been
a
a
subject
of
many
discussions
between
us
and
is
really
our
only
real
obstacle
we
dont
have
any
real
difficulties
with
the
religious
differences
yet
but
i
expect
they
will
pop
up
when
we
have
children
i
have
agreed
to
raise
the
children
nominally
lutheran
that
is
lutheran
traditions
but
trying
to
keep
an
open
mind
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
even
possible
though
i
feel
that
that
the
worst
quality
of
being
devoutly
religous
is
the
lack
of
an
open

anyway
i
guess
ill
get
on
with
my
question
is
anyone
in
the
same
situation
and
can
give
some
suggestions
as
to
how
to
deal
with
this
weve
taken
the
attitude
so
far
of
just
talking
about
it
a
lot
and
not
letting
anything
get
bottled
up
inside
sometimes
i
get
the
feeling
were
making
this
much
bigger
than
it
actually
is
any
comments
would
be

im
curious
to
know
if
christians
ever
read
books
based
on
critique
on
the
religion
classical
text
such
as
age
of
reason
by
paine
or
the
myth
maker
by
jacobi
sometimes
it
is
good
to
know
your
enemy
and
if
you
want
to
do
serious
research
you
have
to
understand
both
sides
and
not
solely
the
one
and
only
right
one
yes
one
does
i
examined
a
critique
of
the
book
of
romans
by
i
think
benjamin
franklin
once
a
deist
i
found
it
amazing
that
benjamin
franklin
missed
the
whole
boat
i
also
have
the
writings
on
thomas
jefferson
sitting
on
my
shelf
and
it
is
amazing
how
much
he
missed
i
have
studied
platos
theory
of
forms
and
aristotelian
hylomorphesism
what
a
pile
of
junk
jesus
makes
plato
and
aristotle
look
like
kindergardeners
psychology
the
id
ego
superego
by
freud
elements
of
truth
but
jesus
explained
it
far
better
and
gave
reasons
thomas
paine
benjamin
franklin
thomas
jefferson
are
mere
men
they
can
screw
up
the
bible
just
as
well
as
any
man
i
do
not
put
these
men
on
a
pedestal
and
if
i
remember
tjs
autobiography
correctly
he
thought
thomas
paine
was
the
most
unread
man
he
ever
met
heres
some
more
circular
reasoning
to
you
paul
says
to
the
corinthians
that
that
the
gospel
will
be
foolishness
to
the
world
because
it
is
spiritually
discerned
and
so
people
without
the
spirit
of
god
havent
a
clue
to
what
the
bible
is
saying
from
your
point
of
view
thats
incredibly
circular
and
convenient
to
me
it
is
mysteriously
and
supernaturally
bizarre
i
can
see
it
but
you
cant
this
is
not
arrogance
on
my
part
trust
me
it
is
as
bizarre
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
truth
explainable
or
not
are
any
of
you
color
blind
to
red
and
green
i
am
remember
those
dot
tests
they
do
at
the
optomologists
they
put
pictures
in
front
of
you
and
you
are
supposed
to
identify
the
pattern
in
the
dots
if
your
eyes
are
perfectly
normal
you
can
see
letters
or
numerals
embedded
in
the
dots
they
are
a
slightly
different
color
and
stand
out
from
the
background
but
if
you
are
color
blind
to
red
and
green
you
will
not
see
anything
but
grayshaded
dots
that
is
how
a
dot
test
appears
to
me
i
do
not
see
a
pattern
at
all
a
normal
seeing
person
will
see
the
patterns
and
to
him
i
seem
like
a
total
anomaly
to
him
i
appear
as
if
i
am
missing
the
universe
or
something
it
is
hard
for
him
to
understand
why
i
cant
see
anything
that
to
him
is
as
plain
as
day
that
it
what
it
is
like
with
the
bible
the
word
of
god
to
the
believer
the
believer
can
see
the
meaning
in
the
words
i
can
see
how
the
patterns
fit
together
there
is
such
depth
such
consistency
but
then
on
the
other
hand
i
notice
the
nonbeliever
he
doesnt
see
it
he
thinks
i
am
weird
because
he
thinks
i
am
seeing
things
i
look
at
him
and
say
no
you
are
weird
you
do
not
see
then
it
is
time
for
a
sanity
check
i
go
to
another
christian
and
say
do
you
see
this
and
they
go
yes
it
is
an
x
and
i
say
thank
god
i
see
the
x
too
it
is
truly
the
strangest
thing
it
adds
a
little
extra
dimension
to
the
phrase
he
will
make
the
blind
see
and
the
deaf
hear
i
am
glad
that
jesus
has
enabled
me
to
see
i
wish
every
nonbeliever
could
see
what

you

things

is

that
cf
kermit
thread
on
what
ra
exact
body
of
theology
are
you
drawing
for
what
you
call
orthodox
orthodox
is
a
compound
word
it
comes
from
orthos
straight
true
right
and
from
doxa
opinion
doctrine
teaching
i
use
orthodox
to
refer
to
right
teaching
as
opposed
to
universal
or
catholic
or
foursquare
gosple
i
think
that
the
greek
orthodox
church
would
take
high
offense
at
your
misuse
of
the
word
your
version
of
christianity
is
neither
mainstream
nor
bible
derived
you
make
claims
of
biblecentricity
that
are
not
derivable
soley
from
the
bible
about
sixseven
months
ago
you
claimed
that
your
primary
objection
to
the
lds
was
that
our
doctrine
was
not
biblederived
and
now
this
and
other
claims
can
be
shown
are
also
not
bible
interpeting
bible
right
teaching
is
derived
from
letting
god
speak
to
us
through
the
bible
this
can
be
from
reading
simple
truths
in
the
scriptures
and
by
using
the
bible
to
interpret
the
bible
simple
truths
oh
for
example
ra
who
is
that
holds
that
luke
meant
what
you
said
he
meant
i
think
that
it
is
apparent
from
reading
the
scriptures
that
are
pertinent
luke
records
christs
promise
to
the
repentant
thief
who
hung
on
an
adjacent
cross
truly
i
say
to
you
today
you
will
be
with
me
in
paradise
but
was
it
not
until
later
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
to
heaven
if
christ
himself
was
not
in
heaven
until
sunday
how
could
the
repentant
thief
have
been
there
with
him
the
answer
lies
in
the
location
of
paradise
when
jesus
died
apparently
paradise
was
not
exalted
to
heaven
until
easter
day
paradise
exalted
to
heaven
paradise
wasnt
equal
to
heaven
and
now
it
is
yet
you
claim
that
peeple
can
not
be
exalted
to
heaven
nicht
wahr
jesus
refers
to
it
in
the
middle
of
the
story
of
the
rich
man
and
lazarus
as
abrahams
bosom
to
which
the
godly
beggar
lazarus
was
carried
by
the
angels
after
his
decease
luke
thus
abrahams
bosom
referred
to
the
place
where
the
souls
of
the
redeemed
waited
till
the
day
of
christs
resurrection
when
i
read
the
story
i
found
that
abrahams
bosom
wasnt
so
much
a
place
but
somewhere
the
rich
man
could
see
and
talk
to
abraham
it
was
not
yet
lifted
to
heaven
but
it
may
well
have
been
a
section
of
hades
hebrew
sheol
reserved
for
believers
who
had
died
in
the
faith
but
would
not
be
admitted
into
the
glorious
presence
of
god
in
heaven
until
the
price
of
redemption
had
actually
been
paid
on
calvary
or
even
that
none
would
precede
the
presence
of
jesus
back
to
glory
with
the
father
gee
this
is
fairly
close
to
what
the
lds
call
spirit
prison
and
what
you
have
called
false
doctrine
doubtless
it
was
the
infernal
paradise
that
the
souls
of
jesus
and
the
repentant
thief
repaired
after
they
each
died
on
friday
afternoon
but
on
sunday
after
the
risen
christ
had
first
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
john
and
her
two
companions
matthew
presumably
he
then
took
up
with
him
to
glory
all
the
inhabitants
of
infernal
paradise
including
abraham
lazarus
and
the
repentant
thief
we
read
in
ephesians
concerning
christ
ascending
on
high
he
led
captivity
captive
he
gave
gifts
unto
men
vers
deleted
reproduced
below
quoted
from
the
sunspot
gopher
archive
presumably
he
led
the
whole
band
of
liberated
captives
from
hades
ie
the
whole
population
of
preresurrection
paradise
up
to
the
glory
of
heaven
this
part
is
not
supported
from
scripture
nor
does
it
support
your
claim
that
the
paradise
where
christ
descended
was
exalted
making
such
claims
on
this
little
evidence
ignores
the
witness
of
the
scripture
sunephas
sun
wherefore
he
saith
when
he
ascended
up
on
high
he
led
captivity

that

now
that

what
is
it
but
that
he
also
descended

into
the
lower
parts
of
the
earth
he
that
descended
is
the
same
sun
also
that
ascended
up
far
above
all
heavens
that
he
might
fill
all
sun
things
and
he
gave
some
apostles
and
some
prophets
and
sun
some
evangelists
and
some
pastors
and
teachers
for
the
sun
perfecting
of
the
saints
for
the
work
of
the
ministry
for
the
sun
edifying
of
the
body
of
christ
till
we
all
come
in
the
unity
of
sun
the
faith
and
of
the
knowledge
of
the
son
of
god
unto
a
perfect
man
sun
unto
the
measure
of
the
stature
of
the
fulness
of
christ
that
we
sun
henceforth
be
no
more
children
tossed
to
and
fro
and
carried
about
sun
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
by
the
sleight
of
men
and
cunning
sun
craftiness
whereby
they
lie
in
wait
to
deceive
but
speaking
the
sun
truth
in
love
may
grow
up
into
him
in
all
things
which
is
the
head
using
this
to
argue
that
paradise
or
spirit
prison
is
now
changed
from
a
preeaster
postion
to
posteaster
by
god
postion
is
not
supportable
makeing
such
a
claim
requires
more
evidence
than
you
have
given
here
ra
whenever
your
personal
interpretation
of
biblical
passages
is
ra
challenged
your
only
response
seems
to
be
that
one
needs
merely
to
ra
look
at
the
bible
in
order
to
see
the
truth
but
what
of
those
who
ra
see
biblical
things
differently
from
you
i
think
that
this
characterization
is
faulty
whenever
my
personal
interpretation
is
questioned
i
usually
give
a
reason
yes
and
your
reasons
are
in
general
not
supported
by
any
direct
reading
of
the
scriptures
you
have
demonstrated
that
you
claims
to
scriptural
proof
need
to
be
crosschecked
the
referencs
that
you
supply
often
do
not
support
your
postion
if
they
are
read
in
the
context
of
the
scripture
as
for
those
that
see
things
differently
please
put
forward
where
there
is
a
valid
difference
and
we
can
discuss
it
i
seem
to
be
seeing
from
you
the
notion
that
any
difference
in
how
one
views
the
bible
is
somehow
legitimate
except
or
course
for
the
stuff
that
i
glean
from
it
put
forward
a
contrary
view
and
perhaps
we
can
have
a
discussion
on
that
topic
but
to
decry
something
that
i
put
forward
without
putting
forward
something
else
to
discuss
and
to
dismiss
what
i
put
forward
while
giving
credence
to
other
alleged
views
that
have
yet
to
be
put
forward
is
simply
being
contentious
how
about
that
those
who
have
been
in
paradise
and
have
accepted
the
gosple
will
be
judged
of
jesus
christ
and
then
return
to
the
presence
of
god
is
that
somehow
different
from
your
expressed
view
that
the
paradise
spoken
of
or
abrahams
bosom
ra
are
we
to
simply
assume
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
really
ra
understands
it
if
you
believe
that
something
that
i
have
drawn
from
scripture
is
wrong
then
please
show
me
from
scripture
where
it
is
wrong
simply
stating
that
there
are
other
views
is
not
a
proof
show
it
to
me
from
scripture
and
then
we
can
go
on
should
we
go
back
and
discuss
your
view
on
why
the
angle
of
the
lord
is
the
lord
again

perhaps
you
should
read
it
and
stop
advancing
the
bible
as
evidence
relating
to
questions
of
science
it
did
jesus
exist
by
g
a
wells
there
is
a
great
fallacy
in
your
statement
the
question
of
origins
is
based
on
more
than
science
alone
nope
no
fallacy
yep
science
is
best
in
determining
how
religions
handle
why
and
who
rich
i
am
curious
as
to
why
you
and
others
award
custody
of
the
baby
to
theists
and
religion
i
hope
i
didnt
award
custody
rich
i
purposely
used
handle
in
order
to
avoid
doing
so
ie
that
happens
to
be
what
religions
do
of
course
there
are
aberrations
like
scientific
creationism
i
used
best
in
part
to
indicate
that
science
currently
has
a
time
of
it
with
why
and
who
so
these
domains
are
mostly
ignored
i
also
attempted
to
be
brief
which
no
doubt
confused
the
matter
as
an
aside
for
science
i
should
have
written
how
and
when
nobody
seems
to
argue
over
what
are
they
theists
theologians
any
better
equiped
to
investigate
the
who
and
why
than
magicians
astrologers
housewives
not
being
sexists
athiests
or
agnostics
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
would
vary
from
individual
to
individual
im
not
trying
to
be
evasive
on
this
but
from
a
societal
perspective
religion
works
on
the
other
hand
sometimes
it
is
abused
and
misused
and
many
suffer
which
you
know
but
the
net
result
seems
positive
this
from
the
anthropological
perspective
on
human
affairs
you
might
call
me
a
neofruedian
insofar
as
i
think
the
masses
cant
get
along
without
religion
not
that
generally
they
are
incapable
they
just
dont
and
for
myriad
reasons
but
the
main
one
seems
to
be
the
promise
of
immortality
very
seductive
that
immortality
therefore
it
seems
that
theologians
are
better
equipped
than
the
others
you
mention
for
dispensing
answers
to
who
and
why
i
suggest
that
this
holds
regardless
of
the
truth
in
their
answers
to
who
and
why
simply
because
people
believe
in
the
end
spiritual
beliefs
are
just
as
real
as
scientific
facts
and
explanation
caution
to
some
do
not
take
this
out
of
context
do
you
suggest
that
the
who
and
why
will
forever
be
closed
to
scientific
investigation
no
in
fact
i
dont
think
it
is
closed
now
at
least
for
some
individuals
isnt
there
a
group
of
theoretical
physicists
who
argue
that
matter
was
created
from
nothing
in
a
big
bang
singularity
this
approach
might
presuppose
an
absence
of
who
and
why
except
that
it
seems
it
could
be
argued
that
something
had
to
be
responsible
for
nothing
maybe
that
something
doesnt
have
to
be
supernatural
maybe
just
mechanistic
but
thats
a
tough
one
for
people
today
to
grasp
in
any
case
theory
without
empirical
data
is
not
explanation
but
then
your
question
does
not
require
data
in
other
words
i
agree
that
theorizing
within
scientific
parameters
is
just
as
scientific
as
explaining
so
the
answer
is
who
and
why
are
not
closed
to
scientists
but
i
sense
that
science
in
these
realms
is
currently
very
inadequate
data
will
be
necessary
for
improvement
and
that
seems
a
long
way
off
if
ever
pretty
convoluted
here
i
hope
ive
made
sense
it
seems
to
me
that
or
so
years
ago
the
question
of
the
origin
of
life
on
earth
was
not
considered
open
to
scientific
enquiry
i
agree
generally
but
i
prefer
to
put
it
this
way
the
questions
of
how
when
who
and
why
were
not
open
to
inquiry
during
the
enlightenment
reason
was
reponsible
for
questioning
the
theological
answers
to
how
and
when
and
not
for
the
most
part
who
and
why
science
was
thus
born
out
of
the
naturalists
curiosity
eventually
carting
away
the
how
and
when
while
largely
leaving
behind
the
who
and
why
the
ignorant
the
selfish
the
intolerant
and
the
arrogant
of
course
still
claim
authority

subject
hell
in
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
there
are
three
differents
words
translated
into
the
word
hell
these
greek
words
have
totally
different
meanings
the
words
are
hades
tartaros
and
gehenna
in
bibical
usage
the
greek
word
hades
is
used
only
times
in
the
new
testament
and
is
roughly
the
equivalent
to
the
old
testament
word
sheol
meaning
the
grave
or
pit
compare
acts
with
psalms
hades
may
be
likened
to
a
hole
in
the
ground
in
the
bible
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
fire
most
modern
bibical
translators
admit
that
the
use
in
the
english
word
hell
to
translate
hades
and
sheol
are
an
unfortunate
and
misleading
practice
why
because
when
seeing
the
word
hell
many
readers
impute
to
it
the
traditional
connotation
of
an
everburning
inferno
when
this
was
never
remotely
intended
in
the
greek
language
or
in
old
english
in
its
true
bibical
usage
hades
does
indeed
refer
to
the
state
or
abode
of
the
dead
but
not
in
the
sense
of
spirits
walking
around
in
some
sort
of
shadowy
realm
hades
is
simply
the
abode
we
call
the
grave
all
dead
go
to
this
hell
the
second
hell
of
the
bible
tartaros
is
mentioned
only
once
in
scripture
for
if
god
spared
not
the
angels
that
sinned
but
cast
them
down
to
hell
tartaros
and
delivered
them
into
chains
of
darkness
to
be
reserved
unto
judgment
following
their
rebellion
to
unseat
god
from
his
throne
the
archangel
lucifer
now
satan
and
a
third
of
the
created
angels
now
demons
were
ejected
from
heaven
luke
they
were
cast
down
to
tartaros
a
place
or
condition
of
restraint
that
god
has
imposed
on
the
mutinous
angels
as
they
await
ultimate
judgment
jude
tartaros
then
is
a
hell
that
applies
only
to
evil
rebellious
angels
or
demons
it
is
interesting
that
the
ancient
greeks
used
this
word
to
describe
the
place
in
which
zeus
confined
the
rebellious
titans
nowhere
in
the
bible
is
there
any
mention
of
men
being
put
into
this
particular
hell
the
the
third
word
that
is
translated
as
hell
in
the
bible
is
gehenna
it
comes
from
the
hebrew
gai
hinnom
meaning
valley
of
hinniom
hinnom
is
a
deep
narrow
ravine
located
to
the
south
and
southwest
of
jerusalem
in
old
testament
times
it
was
a
place
of
abominable
pagan
rites
including
infant
sacrifice
it
was
there
that
the
apostate
kings
ahaz
and
manasseh
made
their
children
pass
through
the
fire
to
the
god
molech
the
rites
were
specifically
celebrated
in
tophet
the
place
of
abhorrence
one
of
the
chief
groves
in
the
valley
king
josiah
of
ancient
judah
finally
put
an
end
to
these
abominations
he
defiled
the
valley
rendering
it
ceremonially
unclean
kings
later
the
valley
became
the
cesspool
and
city
dump
of
jerusalem
a
repository
for
sewage
refuse
and
animal
carcasses
the
bodies
of
dispised
criminals
were
also
burned
there
along
with
the
rubbish
fires
burned
continuously
feeding
by
a
constant
supply
of
garbage
and
refuse
aceldama
the
field
of
blood
purchased
with
the
money
judas
received
for
the
betrayal
of
christ
was
also
in
part
of
the
valley
of
hinnom
so
what
does
this
valley
called
gehenna
have
to
do
with
hell
in
the
satan
inspired
political
dictator
and
a
miracleworking
religious
figure
the
false
prophet
working
with
him
will
resist
the
reestablishment
of
the
government
of
god
by
jesus
christ
at
his
second
coming
their
fate
is
revealed
by
the
apostle
john
and
the
beast
was
taken
and
with
him
the
false
prophet
these
both
were
cast
alive
into
a
lake
of
fire
burning
with
brimstone
where
will
this
temporary
lake
of
fire
this
hell
be
the
prophet
isaiah
wrote
of
this
lake
of
fire
prepared

it

thousand
years
later
satan
himself
will
be
cast
into
this
rekindled
fiery
lake
where
the
beast
and
false
prophet
were
cast
but
what
of
the
wicked
who
have
died
over
the
millennia
does
the
bible
say
that
they
are
now
suffering
fiery
punishment
for
their
sins
in
a
lake
of
fire
in
the
sequence
of
the
incorrigibly
wicked
are
resurrected
to
be
thrown
into
the
lake
of
fire
after
satan
is
cast
there
what
will
become
of
these
wicked
will
they
writhe
in
flames
for
eternity
the
wicked
will
be
burned
up
from
the
intense
heat
of
the
coming
gehenna
fire
on
the
earth
they
wil
be
consumed
annihilated
destroyed
this
punishment
will
be
everlasting
permanent
and
final
the
bible
calls
it
the
second
death
from
which
there
is
no
possibility
of
a
further
resurrection
the
bible
does
teach
eternal
punishment
but
not
eternal
punishing
the
prophet
malachi
provides
a
graphic
description
for
behold
the
day
cometh
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
and
all
the
proud
yea
and
all
that
do
wickedly
shall
be
stubble
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
to
the
righteous
god
says
that
the
wicked
shall
be
ashes
under
the
soles
of
your
gehenna
was
a
place
of
destruction
and
death
not
a
place
of
living
torture
jesus
was
talking
to
jews
who
understood
all
about
this
gehenna
or
valley
of
hinnom
utter
destruction
by
fire
was
complete
nothing
was
left
but
ashes
every
text
in
the
bible
translated
from
this
greek
word
gehenna
means
complete
destruction
not
living
torture
not
eternal
life
in
torment
the
bible
says
in
romans
the
wages
of
sin
is
death
not
eternal
life
in
torture
the
punishment
revealed
in
the
bible
is
death
the
cessation
of

eternal

if

recently
ive
asked
myself
a
rather
interesting
question
what
right
does
god
have
on
our
lives
always
assuming
there
is
a
god
of
course
in
his
infinite
wisdom
he
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
if
we
dont
live
according
to
his
rules
we
will
burn
in
hell
well
with
what
right
can
god
make
that
desicion
lets
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
creates
every
one
of
us
directly
or
indirectly
it
doesnt
matter
what
then
happens
is
that
he
first
creates
us
and
then
turns
us
lose
well
i
didnt
ask
to
be
created
i
guess
i
ought
not
conclude
from
this
then
that
since
you
didnt
ask
to
be
created
you
dont
care
if
you
go
to
hell
lets
make
an
analogue
if
a
scientist
creates
a
unique
living
creature
which
has
happened
it
was
even
patented
does
he
then
have
the
right
to
expect
it
to
behave
in
a
certain
matter
or
die
who
is
god
to
impose
its
rules
on
us
who
can
tell
if
god
is
really
so
righteous
as
god
likes
us
to
believe
are
all
christians
a
flock
of
sheep
unable
to
do
otherwise
that
follow
the
rest
i
dont
consider
myself
an
unthinking
sheep
the
bible
says
god
created
us
to
be
in
communion
and
obedience
to
him
the
first
and
only
rule
was
to
not
eat
of
a
certain
tree
or
else
the
punishment
is
distance
from
him
and
physical
death
gods
intention
in
creating
us
is
to
have
a
relationship
with
us
the
bible
documents
gods
attempts
to
have
that
relationship
culminating
in
the
person
of
jesus
to
bear
the
consequences
of
all
sin
so
that
all
who
accept
him
can
have
a
relationship
with
god
again
the
purpose
of
creation
who
is
god
to
impose
rules
on
us
hes
god
and
he
created
us
i
suppose
he
has
a
right
based
on
who
he
is
above
you
mention
in
his
infinite
wisdom
and
thats
what
id
say
god
exemplifies
but
if
you
were
being
sarcastic
up
there
then
this
whole
discussion
is
irrelevant
eh
and
if
we
believe
god
is
infinitely
wise
that
belief
should
inform

i

that
the

the
lack

just
a
point
i

if
open

means
believing
anything
can

or
we
cant
for
sure
know
what
is
definitely
true
im
happy
to
not

if
however
open
mindedness
means
being
respectful

tolerant

respecting

of
people
of
other

i

ill

is
anyone

and
can
give

how
to
deal

weve
taken
the

roadblock

me
in

making

lukewarm

let

just

you
might
consider
it
something
of
an
aberration
i

what
purpose
does
it
serve
not
much
really
its
just
a
hobby
the

yearns
for

so
on
some

use

other
people
do
not
as
you
state
you
use
your

in

sense
this
diminishes
the

your

as
the

suffer
wear

exposure
in

it
can
enhance
your

some

collect

they

use

id
strongly
recommend
reading
when
prophecy
fails
by
leon
festinger
henry
riecken
and
stanley
schachter
available
as
a
harper
torchbook
it
goes
a
long
way
towards
explaining
how
a
belief
system
can
be
so
strong
as
to
withstand
even
overwhelming
disconfirmatory
evidence
at
least
read
the
first
chapter
interestingly
just
as
the
branch
davidians
had
roots
in
the
seventhday
adventist
movement
the
sdas
themselves
had
their
roots
in
the
millerite
movement
of
the
first
half
of
the
centurya
movement
that
expected
the
end
of
the
world
in
was
disappointed
when
it
did
not
take
place
and
wound
up
as
a
church
thats
also
how
christianity
came
to
be
the
immediate
return
of
jesus
was
expected

it
didnt
happen

the
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
while
they
can
expose
a
lot
of
deception
they
can
also
become
inquisitors
as
one
who
agrees
with
much
of
what
they
say
i
am
also
on
the
receiving
end
and
it
makes
me
realize
the
importance
of
respecting
the
freedom
of
belief
of
every
individual
and
also
of
not
jumping
to
conclusions
and
making
accusations
based
on
a
priori
assumptions
about
an
individual
or
group
for
my
money
the
primary
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
they
are
every
bit
as
wacky
as
the
groups
they
oppose
and
that
by
and
large
they
have
no
compunctions
about
printing
lies
halftruths
and
misleading
innuendos
as
part
of
their
exposes
a
recent
book
on
cults
i
picked
up
by
a
christian
author
quite
simply
mixed
in
all
nonchristian
religions
except
the
jews
and
various
new
age
groups
with
various
fringe
groups
of
dubious
intent
and
legality
on
the
other
hand
the
watchman
fellowship
does
a
good
service
in
exposing
deceptive
practices
that
are
far
too
common
among
the
groups
they
monitor
given
the
record
of
american
christianity
any
group
that
falls
into
the
category
of
fundamentalist
or
bornagain
is
automatically
into
the
inquisition
business
it
is
an
unavoidable
affliction
of
those
who
have
a
proprietary
license
on
the
truth
tm
and
lets
not
forget
that
jonestown
and
the
branch
davidians
are
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
christian
tradition
as
the
missouri
synod
lutherans
and
may
in
fact
be
the
massadas
of
true
christian
believers
i
am
far
more
concerned
about
the
encroachment
of
overtly
christian
indoctrination
into
public
schools
than
i
am
about
yoga
classes
there
for
those
concerned
with
religious
freedom
