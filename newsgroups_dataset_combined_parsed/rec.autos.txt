i
have
been
active
in
defending
saturn
lately
on
the
net
and
would
like
to
state
my
full
opinion
on
the
subject
rather
than
just
reply
to
others
points
the
biggest
problem
some
people
seem
to
be
having
is
that
saturn
dealers
make
on
a
car
i
think
most
will
agree
with
me
that
the
car
is
comparably
priced
with
its
competitors
that
is
they
arent
overpriced
compared
to
most
cars
in
their
class
i
dont
understand
the
point
of
arguing
over
whether
the
dealer
makes
the
or
not
i
have
never
understood
what
the
big
deal
over
dealer
profits
is
either
the
only
thing
that
i
can
figure
out
is
that
people
believe
that
if
they
minimize
the
dealer
profit
they
will
minimize
their
total
outofpocket
expenses
for
the
car
while
this
may
be
true
in
some
cases
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
generally
true
i
bought
a
saturn
sl
in
january
of
at
that
time
based
on
studying
car
prices
i
decided
that
there
was
no
comparable
car
that
was
priced
as
cheaply
as
the
saturn
sure
maybe
i
could
have
talked
the
price
for
some
other
car
to
the
saturn
price
but
my
outofpocket
expenses
wouldnt
have
been
any
different
whats
important
to
me
is
how
much
money
i
have
left
after
i
buy
the
car
reducing
dealer
profit
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saving
money
show
me
how
reducing
dealer
profit
saves
me
money
and
ill
believe
that
its
important
my
experience
has
been
that
reducing
dealer
profit
does
not
necessarily
save
me
money
fred
say
you
bought
your
saturn
at
with
a
dealer
profit
of
if
the
dealer
profit
is
then
you
would
only
be
paying
for
the
same
car
so
isnt
that
saving
money
moreover
if
saturn
really
does
reduce
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
cars
will
be
even
better
deals
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
was
already
below
market
average
for
the
class
of
cars
then
after
they
reduce
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
average
it
will
attract
even
more
people
to
buy
saturns
because
it
would
save
them
money
force
the
competitors
to
lower
their
prices
to
survive
now
not
only
will
saturn
owners
benefit
from
a
lower
dealer
profit
even
the
buyers
for
other
cars
will
pay
less
isnt
that
saving
money

though
in

i

anyone

i

lots
of
hondas

there
is
a
special

where
i
can
get
an

fully
loaded
at

i
have
check
this
out
and
the
numbers
match
up
they
are
doing
this
because
they
are
releasing

includes
dual

and
want
to
get
rid

my

is
this

does
that
with

that
are

not

that
the

rides
alot
better
than

car
driver

have
the

it

fast
so
the
beretta
can
out
handle
the

and
it
can
certainly
keep
up
with
it
in
acceleration
and
the
beretta
probably
has
a
higher
top
speed
due
to
the
horsepower
advantage
hptorque
for
the

you
always
believe
those

why
dont
you
drive
a

and
see
for
your
self
while
the
gsr
has
a
low
torqye
its
high
gearing
over
a

make
up
for
the
difference
still
wouldnt
call
it
a
torque
moster
though
the
biggest
advantage
would
have
to
be
the
price
the
integra
costs
as
tested
motor
trend
the
gtz
costs
as
tested
the
gtz
also
has
standard
nicities
and
airbag
and
antilock
brakes
an
airbag
is
not
available
on
the
integra
and
lower
models
do
not
have
abs
considering
you
save
almost
dollars
for
the
beretta
and
the
is
a
reliable
engine
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
get
the
integra
as
a
performance
coupe
which
is
what
people
have
been
trying
to
make
it
out
to
be
quad
reliable
yeah
whats
your
definition
of
reliable
if
thats
reliable
then
its
safe
to
say
that
integra
engines
in
general
are
near
perfect
not
to
mention
a
hell
of
alot
smoother
and
quieter
balance
shaftsthe
acura
has
the
engine

you
can
rev
that
car
all

everyday
and
youll
never
blow
a
hose
or
crack
the
block
or
anything
else
i
speak
from
expierence
im
not
saying
the
quad
is
a
bad
engine
but
dont
highlight
reliability
when
you
comparing
it
to
a
acura
engine
and
while
the
integra
costs
alot
more
it
is
a
better
investment
since
it
will
hold
its
value
considerably
much
better
and
does
a
nice
job
at
being
a
sporty
car
and
practical
at
the
same
time
note
this
isnt
a

the

is
a
nice

and
puts

respectable
performance
and
a

price
not

it

gave

svx

change
my
friend
brought
a
subaru
svx
recently
i
had
drove
it
for
couples
times
and
i
think
its
a
great
car
esp
on
snow
however
when
she
took
it
to
a
local
subaru
dealer
for
a
oil
change
the
bill
came
out
to
be
about
dollars
the
dealer
told
us
it
is
because
to
change
the
oil
filter
on
a
svx
it
is
necessary
to
disassemble
a
metal
cover
under
the
engine
and
that
took
an
hour
of
labour
at
first
we
think
we
are
being
ripped
off
so
she
phone
to
a
dealer
in
toronto
but
found
out
the
they
are
charging
roughly
the
same
price
so
is
there
any
svx
owner
out
there
that
has
the

problem

the

are
more

also
quarter
mile
times
vary
from

reasonable
probably
faster

so
the

can
out
handle
the

and
it
can
certainly
keep
up
with

in

and
the

probably
has
a

due

the

hptorque
for

you
always

is

still

though
considering
you
save

coming
the

doesnt
see
you
because
your

at
that
is
quite

of

we
are

and
can
react
faster
than
that
only
the

ever
i
worked
out
the

its
plenty
even
for
an

as
long
as
speeds
are
in
the
mph
range
or
less
if
you
or
some
other
driver
is
going
way
faster
than
that
then
be
careful
as
always
you
are
responsible
for
your
driving
actions
if
you
pull
out
to
pass
and
crash
into
someone
for
whatever
reason
its
your
fault
if
you

is
that
i
may
just
kill
the
guy
i
agree
that
i
would
be
at
fault
and
i
will
have
my
license
revoked
why
i
might
even
go
to
the
gas
chamber
but
the
fact
still
remains
that
the
guy
is
dead
someone
died
because
i
was
too
stingy

put

see
a

then
you
shouldnt

i
maintain

strength
the
ratio
of
the
probability
of
fallen
treesrocks
on
the
roads
to
oncoming
traffic
is
too
low
to
even
be
considered
the
difference
is
also
working
on
what
we
know
could
happen
to
what
might
happen
running
lights
are
not
necessary
for
motorists
who
drive
around
it
may
be
a
good
idea
to
force
the
running

headlights
on
when
you
turn
your

wipers
on

only
because
some
people
are
too
stupid
to
do

if

have
to
fight
it

to
show
his
neglegence
if

it
just
out
of
curiosity
how
much
gasmilage
do
you
loose
when
you
put
your

on

how
much
do
you
reduce
the
life
of
your
headlamps
and
what
is
the
cost
of
your
headlamps
anyway
mileage
is
certainly
reduced
but
by
a
very
very
small
amount
probably
about
watts
for
head
and
running
lights
this
is
an
extra
horsepower
that
must

this
has
me
thinking
is
there
a
biological
reason
why
women
cant
put
their
keys
in
their
pants
pockets
like
men
do
i
have
two
pockets
on
the
back
of
each
of
my

i
put
my
keys
in
one
and
wallent
in
another
many
of
the
pockets
even
have
a
botton
on
them
so
i
can
close
them
securely
everything
is
that
much
simpler
for
me
why
cant
women
do
the
same
is
is
biological
ie
not
enough
room
for
a
bigger
bottom
plus
keys
and
a
wallet
or
is
it
the
way
they
are
raised
by
the

oh
pulleeze
its
not
biology
at
all
its
clothing
design
womens
clothing
is
generally
designed
to
be
as
nonfunctional
as
possible
its
only
been
in
the
last
five
years
or
so
that
you
could
buy
womens
pants
with
pockets
deep
enough
to
carry
anything
in
previously
deep
pockets
were
virtually
unknown
in
womens
clothing
skirts
generally
have
better
pockets
now
too
dresses
espcially
fancy
dresses
are
still
pretty
hopeless
i
often
hand
my
drivers
license
over
to
my
husband
if
were
dressed
up
to
go
out
somewhere
so
i
dont
have
to
be
encumbered
by
a
purse
if
women
consistently
bought
functional
clothing
and
boycotted
the
manufacturers
who
refuse
to
make
functional
womens
clothing
i
think
manufacturers
would
tend
to
bow
to
market
pressures
theres
an
interesting
chapter
in
susan
faludis
backlash
that
described
what
happened
the
last
time
clothing
manufacturers
ignored
the
need
for
functional
womens

the
manufactuing

lost
millions
from

would

on
studying
car
prices
i
decided
that
there
was
no
comparable
car
that
was
priced
as
cheaply
as
the
saturn
sure
maybe
i
could
have
talked
the
price
for
some
other
car
to
the
saturn
price
but
my
outofpocket
expenses
wouldnt
have
been
any
different
whats
important
to
me
is
how
much
money
i
have
left
after
i
buy
the
car
reducing
dealer
profit
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saving
money
show
me
how
reducing
dealer
profit
saves
me
money
and
ill
believe
that
its
important
my
experience
has
been
that
reducing
dealer
profit
does
not
necessarily
save
me
money
fred
say
you
bought
your
saturn
at
with
a
dealer
profit
of
if
the
dealer
profit
is
then
you
would
only
be
paying
for
the
same
car
so
isnt
that
saving
money
yes
but
the
point
is
that
prices
are
competetive
saturn
may
well
be
selling
a
car
intended
on
giving
the
dealer
a
profit
but
since
a
comperable
honda
with
profit
is
more
expensive
it
may
be
well
worth
it
to
buy
the
saturn
moreover
if
saturn
really
does
reduce
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
cars
will
be
even
better
deals
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
was
already
below
market
average
for
the
class
of
cars
then
after
they
reduce
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
average
it
will
attract
even
more
people
to
buy
saturns
because
it
would
save
them
money
force
the
competitors
to
lower
their
prices
to
survive
now
not
only
will
saturn
owners
benefit
from
a
lower
dealer
profit
even
the
buyers
for
other
cars
will
pay
less
not
necessarily
it
seems
to
me
that
saturn
salesdroids
who
dont
make
a
commision
whereas
their
counterparts
at
other
dealerships
generally
do
make
more
per
hour
or
whatever
this
means
that
saturn
doesnt
give
up
the
profit
to
their
employees
through
commision
which
is
taken
out
of
per
car
profits
they
just
pass
it
along
to
less
pressureing
salesmenwomen
isnt
that
saving
money
maybe
maybe
not
depends
on
accounting
practices
id
rather
pay
more
for
dealer
service
that
doesnt
cut
corners
to
contain
costs

is
not
about

the
amount
of
money
for
the
type
of

ive
settled
with
a

with
the
similar
amount
of
money
a

asked
for
a
ok
i
know
its
a

i
think
i
got
a
better
car
though
i
have
to
adjust
my
initial
idea
of
why
i
am
getting
a
new
car
today
during
a
conversion
with
a
friend
i
learned
he
rejected
a
saturn
for
a
ford
tarurs
as
it
only
costed
him
a
little
bit
more
than
a
i
may
be
wrong
but
a
loaded
tarus
beats
a
saturn
i
agree
that
a
fullyloaded
would
come
close
in
price
to
a
lowerend
ford
taurus
a
fullyloaded
taurus
on
the
other
hand
would
still
be
substantially
more
expensive
than
even
the
most
glitzy
a
fully
loaded
would
run
somewhere
around
while
a
fully
loaded
taurus

would
be
somewhere
around
the
range
a
base
taurus
gl
i
believe
might
start
around
of
course
there
is
the
taurus
sho
which
can
push
if
you
really
try
but
this
is
a
totally
different
car
than
your
mainstream
taurus
sedan
your
statement
was
not
entirely
faulty
just
a
little
inaccurate
i
cant
see
saturn
is
of
better
value
and
that
is
why
i
was
puzzled
by
its
pricings
oh
we
did
not
spend
much
time
getting
our
deals
being
better
informed
has
its
advantages
well
thats
ok
at
least
youre
not
bitching
about
dealer
profits
like
some
of
the
other
netters
are
you
seem
to
have
rationally
picked
out
the

you

a

that

i

they
offer
some

oh
well
i
have
to
admit
that
the
most
disgusting
feature
of
volvos
is
their
marketing
it
looks
like
volvo
uses
something
like
do
you
dare

your

is
quite
annoying

now
volvo
has

completely

even
the

liked

believe
me
that
is
quite
much

the

a

of

many
people
believe
that

cannot
give
reasonable
warning
of

although
some
manufacturers
of

have
added

anyway
the
number
of
locales
where

is
limited

some
question
the
legality

best
advice
learn

keep

they

else
dont

photo
radar
and

make
no
sense
at
all
speeding
is
a
moving
violation
committed
by
the

not
the

the
owner
may
be
a
rental
agency
a
dealer
a
private
party
or
a
government
agency
as
long
as
the
owner
has
no
reason
to
expect
the
operator
will
be
driving
illegally
or
unsafely
the
owner
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
what
the
operator
does
the
car
may
even
have
been
driven
without
the
owners
knowledge
or
consent
i
cant
believe
a

where
the

is
not
identified
would
stand
up
in

this
is
obviously
a
lazy
cynical
boneheaded
fascist
way
to

has
nothing

we

too
a

eventually
they
had
to
drop
the
idea
as
there
were
a

of
courtcases
where
the
owner
of
the
car
could
prove
he
didnt
drive
it
at
the
time
of
speeding
i
especially
recall
a
case
where
it
eventually
proved
to
be
a

that
had

everyone
wanted
better
fuel
mileage
diesel
fuel
was
the
cheapest
fuel
available
and
usually
provides
better
mileage
than
comparable
gasoline
engines
so
gm
decided
to
conver
their
gas
engine
into
a
diesel
engine
i
think
was
a
liter
big
mistake
the
engine
was
not
redesigned

converted
the
engine
could
not

the

this
has
me
thinking
is
there
a
biological
reason
why
women
cant
put
their
keys
in
their
pants
pockets
like
men
do
i
have
two
pockets
on
the
back
of
each
of
my
pants
i
put
my
keys
in
one
and
wallent
in
another
many
of
the
pockets
even
have
a
botton
on
them
so
i
can
close
them
securely
everything
is
that
much
simpler
for
me
why
cant
women
do
the
same
is
is
biological
ie
not
enough
room
for
a
bigger
bottom
plus
keys
and
a
wallet
or
is
it
the
way
they
are
raised
by
the
parents
ive
found
that
it
has
to
do
with
the
way
womens
clothes
are
made
if
you
put
keys
in
the
front
pocket
of
womens
jeans
or
slacks
you
get
a
bulge
that
also
tends
to
make
it
impossible
to
sit
down
because
they
stick
you
constantly
ditto
in
the
back
pocket
also
try
looking
at
the
back
pockets
of
womens
jeans
and
compare
them
to
the
back
pockets
on
mens
jeans
they
are
usually
if
you
buy
jeans
that
you
expect
to
last
for
any
length
of
time
about
half
the
size
there
flat
out
isnt
room
for
a
wallet
or
a

of

besides
which
where
would
men
put
all
their

if
their

didnt
carry

the

the

illegal
tint
windows
i
know
its
a
long
shot
but
maybe
someone
went
through
this
and
will
have
some
comments
to
share
the
story
is
this
i
bought
a
car
out
of
state
and
im
trying
to
get
the
safety
inspection
in
pennsylvania
the
problem
is
that
the
car
has
aftermarket
tint
on
all
windows
except
the
windshield
the
tint
is
rather
weak
and
you
can
clearly
see
the
inside
of
the
car
through
the
tint
the
inspection
garage
said
that
they
wont
pass
it
unless
i
get
a
waiver
from
the
state
police
so
i
went
to
the
state
police
the
officer
told
me
that
aftermarket
tint
is
illegal
and
i
can
get
a
waiver
only
for
a
car
or
for
a
medical
reason
i
asked
him
to
show
me
the
section
of
the
vehicle
code
that
says
its
illegal
he
showed
it
to
me
and
the
paraghaph
said
that
you
cant
have
tint
if
you
cant
see
the
inside
of
the
car
because
of
the
tint
when
i
told
him
that
you
can
in
fact
see
the
inside
very
well
he
shut
the
book
and
said
its
just
illegal
and
in
fact
we
can
have
someone
give
you
a
ticket
for
it
right
now
well
wont
argue
with
that
since
the
vehicle
code
says
its
ok
as
long
as

ill
reread

id
also
like
to
get
some

paper
from

that
says
its
ok
so
i
can
get
the
inspection
and
so
that
i
wont
get
in
trouble
for
the
tint
later
on
i
also
wouldnt
mind
registering
a
complaint
against
that
officer
he
really
pissed
me
off
so
does
anyone
have
any
experience
getting
that
sort
of
a
paper
from
the
police
especially
in
pennsylvania
does
anyone
have
any
experience
registering
a
complaint
against
an
officer
i
called
the
station
later
on
today
but
they
basically
said
there
is
no
place
where
i
could
register
a
complaint
against
an
officer
and
if
i
do
decide
to
keep
the
tint
and
get
a

anyway
how
much

do
i
stand
to
succesfully
appeal
the

any

actually
remove

although
the

ethyl

do
clean

they
also
cause
rubber

the

came
out
to
be
about
dollars
the

told
us
it

because
to
change
the
oil
filter
on
a
svx
it
is
necessary
to
disassemble
a
metal
cover
under

that
took
an

everything

for

why
cant

is
is
biological

not

the
prices
of
these
cars
theyre
more
expensive
than
theyre
counterparts
the
is
good
reason
for
this
it
is
a
more
upscale
and
trenddriven
market
even
though
many
of
these
models
are
based
on
sedan
platforms
their
interior
etc
is
good
enough
to
warrant
slightly
higher
prices
here
are
some
of
the
platform
derivations
i
can
think
of
tercel
paseo
sentra
civic
del
sol
not
sure
on
this
one
stylus
impulsestorm
to
illustrate
a
tercel
starts
at
around
while
the
paseo
starts
at
around
even
a
tercel
will
cost
less
than
a
paseo
now
you
might
be
saying
that
the
tercel
doesnt
offer
the
power
that
some
offer
what
i
mean
is
that
there
is
no
tercel
with
a
comparable
powerplant
as
its
sport
coupe
derivative
lets
take
another
example
the
isuzu
stylus
xs
and
impulse
xsstorm
gsi
both
have
the
same
powerplants
a
engine
but
the
smaller
coupes
are
generally
more
expensive
again
this
is
because
the
twodoor
sport
coupe
market
is
a
more
fashionoriented
and
trendsetting
segment
people
are
willing
to
pay
more
money
for
this
type
of
car
in
short
even
though
the
may
be
smaller
hence
less
car
its
market
orientation
dictates
a
slightly
higher
price
than
its
mechanically
equivalent
sedan
version
i
hope
this
clears
things
up

bit

i

i
am
fairly
sure
that
placement
of

was
pretty
much
arbitrary
to
the
company
at
that
time
by
the
there
was
a

had

transport
during

convinced
the
government
that
good
raods
were
crucial
to
our
national
defense
anyway
by
the
there
were
plenty
of
good
roads
at
least
around
urban
areas
and
they
were
rapidly
expanding
into
the

netwisdom
says
i
am
wrong
as
to
placement
of
the
steering
wheel
being
arbitrary
by
the
early
teens
there
were
virtually
no
american
cars
that
did
not
have
the
wheel
on
the
left
in
the
early
days
cars
had
the
wheel
on
the
left
on
the
right
and
even
in
the
middle
as
well
as
sometimes
having
a
tiller
instead
of
a
wheel
this
was
standardized
fairly
early
on
though
i
dont
know
why
i
knew
it
was
almost
always
done
but
i
knew
of
no
reason
that
it
might
not
be
done
the
other
way
by
desoto
for
their
car
seems
like
they
had
some
other
deviations

the
ticket
was
for
not
stopping
at
a
stop
sign
given
the
conditions
i
could
not
stop
in
time
and
decided
instead
of
sliding
right
through
the
intersection
i
would
complete
my
rightturn
and
avoid
a
possible
accident
a
police
cruiser
happened
to
be
approaching
the
intersection
from
my
left
and
gave
me
the
ticket
the
officer
said
the
only
reason
that
you
even
slowed
down
in
the
first
place
was
that
you
saw
me
approaching
otherwise
you
would

right

was

i

it

just

i
see
subject
re
electronic
odometers
was
used
bmw
question
i
consulted
with
someone
working
on
an
electronic
odometer
the
design
was
to
use
a
microprocessor
based
system
to
write
a
somewhat
ofuscated
pattern
into
an
eeprom
the
idea
was
to
make
the
circuit
difficult
to
program
arbitrary
values
into
the
eeprom
the
secondary
purpose
acutally
the
primary
purpose
from
the
standpoint
of
practicality
was
to
distributed
the
writes
so
as
to
avoid
exceeing
the
maximum
number
of
writes
fof
the
eeprom
being
used
the
microprocessor
also
ignored
pulses
coming
from
the
hall
effect
at
a
rate
any
higher
than
mph
so
as
to
make
spoofing
the
reading
by
bench
pulsing
at
least
somewhat
undesirable
this
was
for
an
automobile
that
was
not
expected
to
ever
exceed
mph
in
operation
the
case
of
course
might
not
be
the
same
for
your
the
ecm
modules
of
some
cars
do
indeed
store
info
about
conditions
under
which
cars
have
been
operated
since
steering
angle
and
velocity
data
etc
is
available
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
collect
all
sorts
of
interesting
demographic
information
about
the
drivers
use
of
the
car
i
am
not
aware
of
any
manufacturer
currently
trying
to
enforce
warranty
restrictions
based
on
reading
out
use
data
from
the
ecm
while
it
could
be
a
potential
invasion
of
your
privacy
for
manufacturers
to
have
access
to
data
about
your
driving
style
it
could
also
provide
valuable
information
from
actual
field
use
conditions
to
help
engineer
more
appropriate
cars
i
personally
wouldnt
mind
the

i
would
like
to
tap
some
of
the

expertise
available

the
subject
aftermarket

controls
the
background
i
recently
broke
my
ankle
in
a
roadbicycling
accident
places
five
screws
yuk
in
two
weeks
i
will
be
returning
to
texas
my
home
from
my
school
byu
in
provo
utah
as
you
can
imagine
trying
to
drive
nearly
miles
with
a
broken
right
ankle
isnt
just
the
epitome
of
a
good
time
my
car
does
not
have
a
cruise
control
so
i
would
have
to
do
all
the
pedalling
ha
ha
with
my
messedup
ankle
my
question
what
is
the
general
opinion
of
aftermarket
cruise
control
units
i
realize
that
a
cheap
cc
cruise
control
from
say
pep
boys
isnt
going
to
be
as
good
as
a
factory
or
professionally
installed
unit
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
i
uderstand
that
i
probably
cant
expect
much
in
the
way
of
accuracy
looks
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
anythings
gotta
be
better
than
trying
to
drive
with
a
hosed
ankle
i
have
a
jeep
cherokee
speed
standard
engine
with
ketteringsp
ignition
yknow
distributor
cap
rotor
that
setupnot
electronic
maybe
you
couldve
guessed
it
being
an
but
im
just
trying
to
give
information
as
completly
as
i
can
i
found
a
cc
unit
for
bucks
it
seems
to
use
the
vehicles
vacuum
system
instead
of
an
electric
servormotor
is
this
good
or
bad
if
i
did
buy
this
cc
which
vacuum
hose
should
i
tap
it
has
two
speed
sensors
one
magnetic
and
one
that
gets
a
signal
from
the
negative
side
of
the
distributor
kinda
like
a
tach
pickup
or
so
i
understand
i
can
use
either
one
which
is
best
the
manual
says
i
read
it
in
the
store
today
that
the
magneticaxle
setup
is
more
accurate
but
harder
to
install
is
there
really
a
big
difference
it
has
a
sensor
for
the
brake
pedal
just
like
other
ccs
but
does
not
have
a
sensor
for
the
clutch
pedal
so
if
i
wasnt
paying
real
close
attention
i
might
push
the
clutch
in
while
the
cruise
is
trying
to
get
the
speed
up
which
would
wind
the
engine
up
kinda
high
until
i
got
my
wits
about
me
and
turned
the
thing
off
im
pretty
coordinated
so
this
doesnt
bother
me
if
it
were
for
my
girlfriends
car
then
it
would
bother
me
but
im
ok
with
it
the
installation
also
calls
for
an
attachment
to
a
steadyon
brake
signal
and
a
switchedon
brake
signal
i
think
i
can
get
a
switched
brake
signal
from
the
correct
side
of
the
brake
light
blade
fuse
am
i
right
but
im
not
sure
where
to
get
the
steadyon
brake
signal
or
for
that
matter
what
exactly
it
is
any
ideas
as
to
what
the
manufaturer
wants
and
where
to
get
it
i
think
i
can
figure
the
other
things
out
like
how
to
hookup
the
negative
side
tachtype
sensing
gizmo
and
the

control
unit
and

and
all
that
miscellaneous

i

if
any
for
such
a

is
there
any
particularly
good

are

signifacantly

the

i

no

just

it

its
is

the

my

when

i

the

doesnt
scare
me
i
just
want
to
be

installed
correctly

while
not
exactly
a
service
incident
i
had
a
similar
experience
recently
when
i
bought
a
new
truck
i
had
picked
out
the
vehicle
i
wanted
and
after
a
little
haggling
we
agreed
on
a
price
i
wrote
them
a
check
for
the
down
payment
plus
tax
and
license
and
told
them
id
be
back
that
evening
to
pick
up
the
truck
when
i
returned
i
had
to
wait
about
an
hour
before
the
finance
guy
could
get
to
me
when
i
finally
got
in
there
everything
went
smoothly
until
he
started
adding
up
the
numbers
he
then
discovered
that
they
had
miscalculated
the
tax
license
by
about
he
then
said
he
needed
another
from
me
i
said
we
had
already
agreed
on
a
price
and
it
was
their
problem
i
wasnt
giving
them
any
more
money
the
finance
guy
then
brought
in
the
manager
on
duty
who
proceeded
to
give
me
a
hard
time
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
the
customer
and
i
didnt
think
i
should
be
treated
like
that
and
that
if
he
didnt
back
off
he
could
forget
the
whole
deal
he
made
some
smart
remark
so
i
told
him
where
he
could
stick
it
snatched
back
my
check
and
left
needless
to
say
they
were
not
pleased
by
the
turn
of
events
early
the
next
morning
i
got
a
call
from
the
general
sales
manager
wanting
to
know
what
happened
i
related
the
story
and
he
apologised
profusely
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
to
change
my
mind
i
told
him
that
if
they
gave
me
the
truck
for
free
i
probably
still
wouldnt
take
it
that
there
were
other
dealers
in
town
i
was
a
repeat
customer
of
theirs
and
that
they
should
learn
how
to
treat
customersetcetci
was
still
pretty
steamed
about
the
whole
affair
he
gave
me
the
line
about
hating
to
lose
a
customer
and
they
would
try
to
find
a
solution
etc
etc
i
told
him
not
to
bother
thanks
id
go
somewhere
else
a
couple
hours
later
the
owner
of
the
dealership
called
me
all
apologetic
etc
etc
etc
and
said
that
they
would
cover
the
plus
knock
another
off
the
price
of
the
truck
i
told
him
id
think
about
it
and
he
gave
me
his
private
direct
phone
number
his
secretarys
name
and
assured
me
that
they
valued
me
as
a
customer
etc
etc
etc
i
thought
about
it
for
a
few
hours
and
discussed
it
with
my
wife
and
we
decided
what
the
hellthat
was
a
pretty
decent
deal
so
i
called
him
back
and
accepted
his
offer
when
i
went
back
the
next
day
to
pick
up
the
truck
i
received
the
royal
treatment
everyone
seemed
to
know
about
the
incident
even
the
lot
boy
everything
went
smoothly
and
i
was
out
of
there
in
my
new
truck
in
about
mins
so
i
guess
im
a
reasonably
satisfied
customer
however
it
should
not
have
happened
in
the
first
place
i
was
a
bit
shocked
to
have
a
sales
person
talk
to
me
like
that
i
dont
expect
them
to
bow
and
grovel
but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
given
a
hard
time
either
esp
when
its
their
mistake
anyway
im
happy
with
the
truck
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
couple
hundred
dollars
under
invoice
and
they
paid
most
of
the
first
years
license
fee
im
not
sure
whether
ill
go

crossposting
crossposting
occurs
when
more
than
one
newsgroup
name
is
included
on
the
newsgroups
line
in
the
article
header
such
articles
will
appear
in
all
of
the
newsgroups
listed
crossposting
is
one
of
the
most
misunderstood
and
misused
facilities
on
usenet
you
should
only
post
to
a
group
because
you
feel
an
article
is
appropriate
you
should
never
crosspost
just
to
reach
a
particular
audience
this
distinction
is
subtle
but
important
radar
detector
articles
for
example
are
moreorless
appropriate
in
recautos
they
are
almost
never
appropriate
in
scielectronics
or
rechamradio
and
the
fact
that
you
might
want
to
reach
the
audience
in
scielectronics
or
rechamradio
is
not
adequate
justification
for
posting
to
either
group
crossposting
between
any
or
all
of
the
recautos
groups
is
usually
inappropriate
if
you
find
yourself
doing
so
consider
whether
or
not
it
is
truly
advisable
before
sending
your
article
consider
setting
followupto
to
point
to
only
one
newsgroup
if
you
feel
you
must
crosspost
crossposting
between
recautos
and
miscconsumers
is
chancy
at
best
in
particular
flame
wars
over
the
speed
limit
in
the
us
andor
the
use
of
radar
detectors
should
never
be
crossposted
between
any
of
these
groups
most
readers
of
scielectronics
and
recradio
couldnt
care
less
about
the
police
radar
and
radar
detector
arguments
that
go
on
endlessly
in
recautos
it
is
an
excellent
idea
to
check
the
newsgroups
and
followupto
lines
of
articles
before
posting
a
followup
in
particular
be
wary
of
posting
to
misctest
recartsstartrek
or
talkbizarre
or
any
combination
of
these
three
the
life
you
save
may
be
your
own
distribution
there
is
a
field
in
the
header
of
any
news
article
which
allows
you
to
partially
control
where
the
article
goes
it
is
called
the
distribution
field
it
may
be
very
useful
for
many
reasons
it
should
also
serve
as
a
reminder
that
news
is
a
very
large
and
widespread
system
the
distribution
of
recautos
is
fairly
extensive
as
of
this
writing
the
automotive
newsgroups
are
known
to
reach
most
of
europe
australia
new
zealand
and
some
locations
in
japan
with
this
in
mind
i
offer
the
following
hints
about
use
of
the
distribution
field
in
your
article
headers
and
on
article
content
please
take
care
not
to
send
forsale
ads
about
clapped
out
ford
mavericks
in
new
jersey
to
france
or
california
i
doubt
that
anyone
in
either
place
will
care
except
for
my
girlfriend
who
for
some
strange
reason
likes
mavericks
but
only
mavericks
at
that
when
posting
technical
questions
please
include
the
market
for
which
your
car
was
manufactured
for
example
there
are
a
number
of
differences
between
a
europeanmarket
ford
escort
and
a
usmarket
escort
likewise
all
and
early
alfa
romeos
reached
the
us
with
spica
fuel
injection
european
market
cars
usually
got
carbs
often
webers
these
differences
can
be
important
to
your
readers
make
your
situation
clear
failure
to
do
so
can
lead
to
pointless
flame
wars
and
a
significant
spread
of
misinformation
be
careful
about
your
capacities
and
specifications
when
posting
in
the
us
we
get
a
mix
of
metric
and
english
system
values
whereas
europe
is
almost
entirely
on
the
metric
system
a
future
edition
of
this
monthly
posting
will
contain
a
list
of
commonlyused
abbreviations
that
may
not
be
known
in
some
places
that
recautos
reaches
this
cuts
both
ways
so
let
us
not
be
parochial
about
it
use
the
distribution
field
to
limit
where
your
article
goes
when
possible
within
north
america
the
values
na
north
america
can
canada
and
usa
may
be
used
in
addition
the
twoletter
state
abbreviations
of
the
us
are
supported
in
some
cases
eg
if
i
wanted
to
send
an
article
only
to
new
york
and
new
jersey
i
could
put
nynj
in
a
distribution
field
note
that
multiple
commaseparated
values
are
legal
these
distribution
fields
vary
widely
however
so
you
should
check
with
your
local
sysadmin
to
find
out
what
is
likely
to
be
supported
in
your
area
the
dangers
of
overgeneralization
to
amplify
a
warning
from
the

section
of
this

be
wary
of
making
foolish
assumptions
about
all
cars
tires
etc
what
is
true
for
a
buick
with
a
engine
may
be
quite
utterly
wrong
for

headlight
laws
in

are
decidedly
different
from
those
in

the
need
for
adequate

when
you
ask
a
question
please
give
a
reasonable
amount
of
information
eg
if
you
have
a
question
about
your
honda
please
specify
year
model
engine
size
etc
otherwise
most
answers
to
your
question
may
be
quite
useless
concerning

at
one
time
or
another
every
auto
manufacturer
has
manufactured
a

even

admits
to
this

dont

by
announcing
to
the

that

are
worse
than

they
cause
substantial
wasted
bandwidth
while

no

about
who
you
choose

consider
not
insulting
anyone
asking

it
is
a

idea
to

end
it
with

some

questions
tire
questions
q
what
do
the
funny
numbers
on
the
sides
of
my
tires
mean
a
typically
you
will
see
something
like
the
is
the
overall
width
of
the
tire
in
millimeters
the
tread
is
usually
narrower
the
is
the
aspect
ratio
it
indicates
the
height
of
the
sidewall
of
the
tire
relative
to
the
overall
width
our
example
tire
has
a
sidewall
height
of
mm
the
is
the
wheel
diameter
in
inches
there
are
also
some
special
tires
called
trx
tires
which
have
three
digit
metric
wheel
diameter
designations
like
which
is
in
millimeters
the
r
means
radial
and
the
h
is
a
speed
rating
indicating
the
highest
speed
at
which
the
tire
when
properly
inflated
and
carrying
an
appropriate
load
may
safely
operate
common
speed
ratings
are
s
t
h
and
v
up
to
recent
changes
to
the
method
for
specifying
tire
sizes
move
the
speed
rating
to
a
different
part
of
the
designation
you
may
therefore
find
designations
like
the
indicates
the
pertire
load
associated
with
the
speed
rating
exceeding
this
load
in
continuous
operation
at
the
rated
speed
is
dangerous
practice
what
follows
is
a
table
showing
a
number
of
load
indices
and
corresponding
maximum
pertire
loads
load
index
max

note
that
the
usual
mass
vs
weight
confusion
occurs
in
this
table
in
some
cases
the
letters
p
or
lt
may
be
found
in
front
of
a
tire
size
the
lt
designation
indicates
light
truck
and
the
p
designation
indicates
passenger
car
if
no
letter
is
given
then
the
application
of
the
tire
is
passenger
car
usage
as
far
as
i
know
these
letters
only
appear
in
the
us
market
the
lt
designation
is
prinicipally
of
interest
to
owners
of
light
trucks
and
other
utility
vehicles
for
the
owner
of
a
passenger
vehicle
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
a
tire
with
a
p
designation
and
one
with
no
designation
at
all
if
the
aspect
ratio
is
omitted
it
is
probably
but
may
be
tires
with
an
ms

may
have
their

reduced

kmh
about
there
is
an
additional
set
of

on

temperature
and
traction
are
graded
a
b
and
c
with
a
the
best
and
c
the
worst
treadwear
is
a
numeric
rating
these
values
are
of
limited
value
as
they
are
assigned
somewhat
arbitrarily
by
tire
manufacturers
and
are
thus
not
useful
in
comparing
different
brands
of

q
my
car
has
tires
with
a
funny
size
designation
can
i
put
normal
tires
on
the
car
a
your
tires
are
called
trx
tires
they
were
devised
by
michelin
because
of
a
somewhat
different
bead
design
they
are
incompatible
with
normal
tires
michelin
used
a
different
diameter
wheel
for
them
so
that
they
could
not
be
mounted
on
the
wrong
type
wheel
and
so
that
more
conventional
tires
could
not
be
mounted
on
trx
type
wheels
you
will
need
to
aquire
different
wheels
to
put
a
normal
tire
on
your
car
it
is
barely
possible
to
fit
normal
tires
on
trx
wheels
and
horribly
dangerous
to
do
so
the
tires
may
simply
peel
off
the
rims
in
a
corner
or
possibly
blow
out
at
high
speed
trx
type
tires
are
becoming
hard
to
find
in
addition
to
michelin
avon
makes
suitable
tires
goodyear
has
apparently
discontinued
their
line
of
trx
tires
q
can
i
rotate
radials
from
side
to
side
or
rotate
them
only
on
one
side
of
my
car
a
car
and
tire
manufacturers
have
differing
views
on
this
subject
many
say
that
swapping
radials
between
the
left
and
right
hand
sides
of
a
car
is
now
ok
this
group
includes
michelin
and
goodyear
others
for
example
pirelli
and
nokia
will
void
warranties
if
such
swapping
is
done
the
best
advice
is
to
read
your
tire
manual
carefully
before
rotating
your
tires
and
stick
to
the
manufacturers
recommendations
q
how
many
snow
tires
should
i
buy
and
if
i
buy
which
end
of
the
car
should
i
put
them
on
a
in
short
and
both
ends
to
explain
many
drivers
in
areas
that
dont
get
excessive
snow
or
who
dont
drive
agressively
or
at
all
in
snow
conditions
get
away
with
only
two
snows
on
the
drive
wheels
but
there
are
circumstances
where
this
can
be
dangerous
practice
with
a
rear
wheel
drive
car
you
can
choose
between
being
able
to
start
the
car
going
a
function
of
the
rear
axle
or
stopping
and
turning
the
car
a
function
of
the
front
axle
in
a
front
wheel
drive
car
you
start
stop
and
turn
with
the
front
end
the
primary
risk
of
putting
the
snow
tires
on
the
front
only
is
that
if
you
have
to
put
on
the
brakes
while
going
downhill
you
run
a
serious
risk
of
going
downhill

radar

in
this
qa
posting

questions
about

and

crossposted

always
start
long
tedious
and
pointless

safety
equipment
q
do
airbags
really
work
a
preliminary
statistics
suggest
the
following
airbags
work
much
better
than
no
belts
good
point
belts
alone
work
much
better
than
airbags
alone
and
airbags
point
belts
work
slightly
better
than
point
belts
alone
the
con
to
airbags
is
that
some
designs
tend
to
burn
the
drivers
hands
when
venting
the
byproducts
of
the
explosion
that
occurs
inside
the
bag
and
that
some
designs
but
not
all
may
knock
the
drivers
hands
from
the
wheel
making
retention
of
control
of
the
vehicle
after
the
bag
deflates
more
difficult
brake
questions
q
do
i
always
need
to
get
the
rotors
on
my
disk
brakes
turned
midas
always
wants
to
do
this
a
no
there
are
specific
conditions
that
mandate
turning
or
replacing
rotors
some
shops
try
and
make
a
little
extra
money
by
replacing
rotors
more
often
than
is
strictly
necessary
if
the
rotors
are
not
warped
warped
and
only
lightly
grooved
then
there
is
no
need
to
replace
or
to
turn
them
note
also
that
some
rotors
the
rotors
on
many
hondas
are
a
good
example
are
so
narrow
to
begin
with
that
it
is
not
practical
to
turn
them
they
must
be
replaced
when
they
become
too
thin
warped
or
badly
grooved
q
they
tell
me
i
should
downshift
when
braking
to
slow
my
car
down
is
this
really
a
good
idea
a
it
used
to
be
a
very
good
idea
back
in
the
days
of
mediocre
fade
prone
drum
brakes
in
modern
disc
brake
equipped
cars
use
of
downshifting
to
slow
the
car
is
not
really
necessary
except
in
cases
of
long
steep
downhill
runs
otherwise
modern
disc
brakes
are
more
than
adequate
to
stop
a
passenger
car
in
all
circumstances
and
they
are
much
cheaper
to
repair
than
clutch
linings
on
the
other
hand
many
standard
drivers
license
tests
in
the
usa
still
specify
that
the
driver
being
tested
downshift
under
braking
i
suggest
that
before
taking
a
us
drivers
test
you
either
learn
to
do
this
smoothly
which
takes
some
time
and
practice
or
borrow
a
car
with
an
automatic
to
take
the
test
q
how
often
should
i
replace
my
brake
fluid
a
probably
more
often
than
you
do
traditional
brake
fluids
tend
to
absorb
water
this
water
can
corrode
internal
parts
of
the
brake
system
and
also
lower
the
boiling
point
of
the
fluid
type
are
older
fluids
and
are
newer
specifications
the
principal
differences
are
in
wet
and
dry
boiling
points
the
dry
boiling
point
is
important
in
fresh
brake
fluid
but
the
wet
boiling
point
is
important
in
older
brake
fluid
fluids
have
the
lowest
wet
and
dry
boiling
point
requirements
fluids
have
better
boiling
point
requirements
and
fluids
have
the
best
boiling
point
requirements
but
fluids
are
not
clearly
superior
see
the
next
qa
for
more
details
while
the
requirements
imply
that
fluids
are
better
than
fluids
there
may
be
specific
cases
where
a
fluid
is
preferable
but
these
are
mostly
competition
applications
otherwise
type
fluids
offer
much
improved
brake
pedal
feel
replacement
once
a
year
is
recommended
for
fluids
although
agressive
drivers
may
profit
by
changing
out
fluid
more
frequently
or
at
least
bleeding
a
modest
amount
of
fluid
out
of
the
brake
calipers
fairly
regularly
q
what
about
brake
fluids
a
this
breaks
down
in
to
two
parts
the
specification
looks
excellent
for
performance
but
the
first
fluids
were
silicone
based
silicone
fluids
are
a
tricky
proposition
unlike
and
fluids
they
do
not
absorb
water
at
all
while
this
may
sound
like
a
feature
the
problem
is
that
any
water
present
pools
up
in
such
systems
interfering
with
braking
performance
and
corroding
any
metals
at
the
spot
where
the
pooling
is
occuring
the
water
will
tend
to
migrate
downwards
in
the
braking
system
to
the
brake
calipers
where
most
of
the
corrosion
occurs
because
of
this
phenomenon
it
is
essential
when
converting
to
silicone
to
empty
the
entire
brake
system
and
flush
it
throughly
beforehand
some
even
recommend
replacing
all
rubber
parts
in
the
brake
system
when
converting
to
silicone
fluids
two
other
issues
that
come
up
with
silicone
fluids
they
are
difficult
to
pour
cleanly
that
is
without
air
bubbles
which
interferes
with
getting
a
good
brake
pedal
feel
and
while
they
generally
have
much
higher
boiling
points
than
fluids
they
do
have
high
temperature
failure
modes
which
are
indistinguishable
in
effect
from
boiling
fluids
silicone
fluids
may
make
sense
in
some
street
car
applications
but
they
are
certainly
not
recommended
for
high
performance
driving
applications
and
the
economics
are
questionable
for
street
use
i
have
recently
become
aware
of
new
fluids
that
meet
the
standard
that
do
not
contain
silicones
these
fluids
appear
to
be
reasonably
compatible
with
the
older
and
fluids
but
i
have
little
information
at
this
time
q
abs
is
available
on
some
of
the
cars
im
looking
at
but
it
costs
more
is
it
worth
it
a
this
does
not
have
a
cut
and
dried
answer
therefore
this
answer
will
be
quite
long
in
order
to
cover
the
pros
and
cons
the
short
answer
is
that
abs
costs
more
both
initially
and
to
maintain
will
generally
work
better
for
the
average
driver
that
is
to
say
a
driver
who
does
not
have
extensive
experience
in
high
performance
driving
techniques
and
may
require
the
unlearning
of
some
obsolete
braking
techniques
like
pump
braking
which
should
be
unlearned
in
any
case
now
for
the
long
answer
abs
works
by
monitering
the
wheels
of
the
car
looking
for
signs
of
locked
brakes
it
may
or
may
not
be
able
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
different
wheels
there
are
several
systems
on
the
market
it
cannot
detect
impending
lockup
which
is
what
you
would
really
want
in
an
ideal
world
but
only
the
existence
of
lockup
the
sensors
used
vary
some
of
the
less
well
designed
sensors
are
sensitive
to
tire
size
and
to
brake
pad
material
and
may
cease
to
function
properly
if
the
owner
deviates
from
original
equipment
or
oeequivalent
components
when
the
sensors
detect
lockup
the
abs
system
responds
by
unlocking
the
brakes
either
individually
or
all
at
once
depending
on
the
system
if
the
driver
keeps
their
foot
firmly
planted
the
abs
will
end
up
cycling
between
the
locked
and
unlocked
states
if
a
sensor
existed
that
could
detect
impending
lockup
then
we
could
sit
right
at
that
point
which
is
where
maximum
braking
effect
is
achieved
this
pulsing
can
often
be
felt
in
the
brake
pedal
as
the
system
cycles
the
percentage
of
the
time
that
the
brakes
are
truly
engaged
is
called
the
duty
cycle
typically
in
an
abs
system
this
is
about
on
dry
pavement
a
trained
driver
can
beat
this
duty
cycle
quite
reliably
using
a
technique
called
threshold
braking
on
wet
pavement
braking
is
so
chancy
that
abs
will
outperform
threshold
braking
nearly
every
time
unfortunately
on
mud
and
on
snow
often
maximum
braking
effect
can
be
acheived
with
the
brakes
locked
only
audi
of
the
manufacturers
producing
absequipped
cars
has
seen
fit
to
provide
a
disable
switch
for
the
abs
system
for
this
eventuality
a
particularly
important
feature
of
abs
is
that
it
preserves
steering
control
this
is
the
case
simply
because
if
you
are
braking
near
the
limit
and
turn
the
wheel
the
abs
will
release
the
brakes
if
it
sees
steeringtriggered
lockup
and
back
off
on
the
percentage
of
the
time
that
the
brakes
are
applied
braking
distances
will
lengthen
accordingly
an
important
caution
abs
cannot
exceed
the
maximum
theoretical
braking
force
in
any
given
situation
if
you
start
sliding
on
glare
ice
dont
expect
an
abs
system
to
help
you
out
very
much
the
coefficient
of
friction
is
not
changed
by
the
presence
of
an
abs
system
in
your
car
as
far
as
maintenence
goes
in
addition
to
the
potential
restrictions
ive
listed
above
you
have
to
worry
about
the
following
parts
costs
are
much
higher
the
oe
master
cylinder
for
my
obscure
european
sedan
lists
for
but
the
oe
master
cylinder
for
the
absequipped
version
of
the
same
car
lists
for
over
most
manufacturers
explicitly
forbid
use
of
silicone
brake
fluids
in
absequipped
vehicles
because
of
the
potential
cost
of
replacement
of
corroded
brake
system
components
regular
i
suggest
annual
replacement
of
brake
fluid
becomes
very
important
q
what
about
this
threshold
braking
business
a
normally
id
not
put
this
in
the
consumers
qa
but
recent
publicity
about
a
number
of
accidents
involving
police
drivers
in
absequipped
chevy
caprices
suggests
that
this
section
is
needed
here
rpw
threshold
braking
is
a
technique
practiced
by
all
serious
high
performance
drivers
if
made
a
habit
it
replaces
the
stab
the
pedal
and
lock
em
up
panic
habit
entirely
and
is
much
to
be
prefered
basically
the
premise
is
that
tires
generate
maximum
braking
force
when
they
have
just
started
to
slide
but
just
before
the
wheels
lock
up
entirely
drivers
who
threshold
brake
learn
to
feel
what
this
threshold
feels
like
and
learn
to
search
for
it
and
hit
it
on
the
application
of
the
brake
pedal
in
many
cars
you
can
feel
that
you
are
near
the
threshold
when
the
pedal
starts
to
firm
up
as
you
depress
it
in
any
case
if
you
cant
hear
the
tires
whine
just
a
bit
youre
not
very
near
the
threshold
in
a
car
with
abs
often
there
is
a
twinge
in
the
pedal
just
before
the
system
starts
cycling
if
the
driver
backs
off
on
the
pedal
just
a
tad
when
the
twinge
is
felt
then
they
are
very
close
to
the
threshold
and
theyll
probably
achieve
better
stopping
distances
than
if
they
just
punched
it
and
let
the
abs
take
over
recently
there
has
been
a
rash
of
publicity
over
a
number
of
accidents
and
one
death
involving
police
cars
equipped
with
abs
systems
the
police
departments
in
question
quickly
blamed
the
new
abs
systems
but
according
to
autoweek
magazine
it
now
seems
clear
that
the
problem
was
a
lack
of
training
none
of
the
involved
officers
had
any
recent
performance
driving
training
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
drivers
reacted
to
the
pulsing
brake
pedal
by
pump
braking
an
old
and
discredited
technique
of
stabbing
and
releasing
the
brake
pedal
the
goal
being
to
try
and
get
brakes
back
with
a
failing
hydraulic
system
if
you
think
about
it
for
a
minute
youll
realize
that
pump
braking
must
cut
the
effective
operation
of
a
working
brake
system
by
at
least
so
if
you
cut
the
duty
cycle
of
an
abs
system
by
that
much
you
are
giving
up
most
of
your
brakes
for
the
wrong
reason
threshold
braking
has
the
advantage
in
that
it
is
an
effective
and
useful
technique
regardless
of
whether
your
car
has
abs
if
you
do
fear
a
failed
hydraulic
system
then
one
or
two
stabs
at
the
pedal
will
be
sufficient

q
what
do

in

designation
mean
a
there
are
several
different
items
encoded
there
is
a
twoletter
code
indicating
the
type
of
detergent
package
that
the
manufacturer
uses
in
the
oil
this
looks
like
sesfcd
or
such
the
s
codes
are
for
gasoline
engine
applications
the
c
codes
are
for
diesel
engine
applications
the
second
letter
is
assigned
in
sequence
as
new
levels
of
protection
are
developed
thus
sf
is
considered
better
than
se
se
is
considered
better
than
sd
and
so
forth
the
more
noticeable
designation
is
the
oil
weight
this
is
either
a
single
number
eg
weight
or
a
pair
of
numbers
separated
by
the
letter
w
eg
the
latter
type
is
much
more
commonly
used
these
days
and
are
the
only
type
that
most
automobile
manufacturers
specify
in
operators
manuals
the
first
number
in
the
designation
is
the
apparent
viscosity
of
the
oil
when
it
is
cold
the
w
stands
for
winter
the
second
number
is
the
viscosity
of
the
oil
when
hot
there
is
a
trick
here
the
oil
doesnt
actually
get
thicker
turn
from
weight
to
weight
as
it
gets
hotter
what
is
actually
happening
is
that
when
the
oil
is
cold
it
has
the
viscosity
of
a
cold
weight
oil
as
it
gets
hotter
it
doesnt
get
thin
as
fast
as
a
oil
would
by
the
time
it
is
up
to
temperature
it
has
the
viscosity
of
a
hot
weight
oil
note
that
these
numbers
actually
specify
ranges
of
viscosities
not
all
oils
have
exactly
the
same
viscosity
when
cold
and
not
all
weight
oils
have
the
same
viscosity
when
hot
note
also
that
the
novel
behaviour
of
multigrade
oils
is
caused
by
additives
and
it
has
been
reported
that
with
the
sole
exception
of
castrol
gtx

not
retain
their

well
over

disagree

auto
manufacturers
recommend
that
you
continue
to

at
the
intervals
recommended
in
the
owners
manual
for
your

even
if
you
decide
to
try
the
longer
intervals
at

change
the
oil
filter
at

synthetics

just

reviews
however
q
manufacturers
are
specifying
longer
and
longer
oil
change
intervals
how
often
should
i
change
my
oil
a
it
depends
on
how
you
drive
if
your
car
always
or
nearly
always
gets
warmed
up
and
you
dont
drive
it
very
hard
and
keep
the

down
the
manufacturers
recommendation
is
probably
fine
if
however
you
drive
it
hard
drive
it
at
high
revs
or
alternatively
if
you
only
drive
it
to
and
from
the
supermarket
so
that
it
doesnt
get
up
to
temperature
then
you
may
wish
to
change
oil
much
more
often
perhaps
at
mile
intervals
given
that
most
manufacturers
are
now
specifying
mile
intervals
if
you
dont
drive
your
car
much
at
all
say
miles
a
year
then
you
probably
want
to
change
oil
every
six
months
anyway
if
you
are
storing
a
car
during
the
winter
then
change
oil
before
storing
it
and
change
oil
when
you
bring
it
out
of

misc
questions
q
my
car
has
a
timing
belt
i
hear
that
bad
things
happen
when
they
break
whats
the
story
a
it
depends
on
the
internal
design
of
the
motor
early
ford
escorts
for
example
will
suffer
severe
valve
damage
if
the
belt
breaks
but
the
newer
cars
will
just
require
a
tow
and
installation
of
a
new
belt
some
honda
motors
will
not
be
damaged
but
others
will
be
if
no
replacement
interval
is
specified
for
your
car
then
change
the
belt
at
least
every
miles
some
cars
may
require
more
frequent
replacement
ask
your
dealer
or
independent
mechanic
also
ask
if
there
are
any
related
repairs
that
should
take
place
at
the
same
time
for
example
the
same
ford
escorts
that
suffer
valve
damage
also
have
a
timing
belt
driven
water
pump
which
has
been
known
to
seize
destroying
the
timing
belt
and
which
then
causes
major
valve
damage
as
a
side
effect
replacing
the
timing
belt
while
ignoring
the
water
pump
can
be
a
costly
mistake
q
why
would
anyone
be
stupid
enough
to
design
a
motor
so
that
it
self
destructs
when
the
timing
belt
breaks
a
for
performance
reasons
compromising
piston
design
so
that
the
valves
and
pistons
will
not
collide
requires
that
the
compression
ratio
of
the
engine
be
reduced
significantly
this
is
why
you
are
more
likely
to
avoid
valve
damage
in
economy
cars
than
in
performance
oriented
vehicles
q
what
causes
unintended
acceleration
a
the
final
report
of
the
national
highway
transportation
and
safety
administration
concluded
that
unintended
acceleration
could
not
be
caused
by
any
mechanical
failure
of
the
vehicle
in
question
and
at
the
same
time
be
consistent
with
the
physical
evidence
the
nhtsa
report
goes
on
to
conclude
that
pedal
misapplication
by
the
vehicle
operator
is
probably
the
cause

militech
i
saw
an
interesting
product
in
ny
auto
show
and
would
like
to
hear
your
comments
militechtm
is
yet
another
oil
additive
but
the
demonstration
of
this
product
really
impressive
if
it
didnt
cheat
the
setup
of
the
demo
is
fairly
simple
a
cone
shaped
rotor
is
half
submerged
in
a
small
oil
sink
filled
with
motor
oil
the
rotor
is
powered
by
an
electronic
motor
a
metal
pad
is
pressed
against
the
rotor
using
the
torque
wrench
until
the
rotor
stopped
by
friction
the
torque
that
is
needed
to
stop
rotor
is
read
from
the
torque
wrench
before
militech
was
added
the
rotor
was
stopped
with
about
lbft
of
torque
you
pick
the
brand
of
oil
no
difference
once
militech
was
added
to
the
oil
the
rotor
could
not
be
stopped
even
with
lbft
of
torque
here
is
the
good
part
even
after
the
salesman
emptied
the
oil
sink
you
still
could
not
stopped
the
rotor
with
the
thin
film
remained
on
it
they
say
you
need
only
add
per
quart
of
oil
every
miles
a
oz
bottle
is
i
still
have
my
doubts
if
this
product
is
really
so
great
why
it
was
so
little
known
the
salesman
said
it
is
widely
used
in
military
i
didnt
believe
it
the
demo
was
so
impressive
that
i
bought
a
bottle
against
my
common
sense
has
anyone
heard
of
or
actually
used
this
product
is
it
real

you
are
going

show
please
visit

stand
on

radiate
more
strongly

q

in

a

which
the

unit
determines
to
have
been
in

limit
tickets
are
mailed
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
because
of
the
low
power
and
the

many
people
believe
that
a
radar
detector
cannot
give
reasonable
warning
of
a
ka

unit
although
some
manufacturers
of
radar

have
added
such

questions
q
what
are
understeer
and
oversteer
a
understeer
and
oversteer
are
terms
describing
the
behaviour
of
a
car
while
cornering
near
the
limit
limit
of
adhesion
that
is
most
drivers
do
not
normally
drive
hard
enough
for
these
terms
to
be
descriptive
of
the
situations
they
encounter
simply
put
they
tell
whether
the
car
wants
to
go
straight
in
a
corner
steer
less
or
understeer
or
it
wants
to
turn
more
in
a
corner
oversteer
understeer
is
commonly
designed
into
most
production
cars
so
that
untrained
drivers
inadvertantly
traveling
too
fast
wont
get
into
trouble
understeer
may
also
be
induced
by
using
too
much
throttle
in
a
corner
oversteer
is
designed
into
some
more
performance
oriented
cars
it
may
be
induced
by
lifting
on
the
throttle
trailing
throttle
oversteer
or
tto
in
extreme
cases
lifting
on
the
throttle
may
induce
so
much
oversteer
that
the
car
reacts
by
fishtailing
or
spinning
some
technical
details
in
a
corner
at
speed
the
tires
on
the
car
will
develop
what
are
called
slip
angles
the
slip
angle
is
the
angular
difference
between
the
direction
that
the
car
is
traveling
and
the
direction
that
the
steering
wheel
is
directing
the
car
to
travel
in
understeer
the
front
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
rear
wheels
in
oversteer
the
rear
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
front
wheels
q
what
is
a
revmatched
downshift
a
when
downshifting
the
engine
must
be
rotating
faster
in
the
lower
gear
than
it
was
in
the
higher
gear
however
during
a
downshift
normally
you
declutch
and
lift
your
foot
from
the
throttle
so
the
revs
drop
rather
than
increase
in
revmatched
downshift
you
blip
the
throttle
before
reengaging
the
clutch
so
that
the
engine
will
already
be
up
to
the
new
speed
this
results
in
a
much
smoother
and
faster
downshift
q
what
does
heelandtoe
mean
a
heelandtoe
is
a
technique
used
to
do
a
revmatched
downshift
while
braking
this
is
normally
challenging
because
you
need
the
right
foot
for
both
the
brake
and
throttle
it
is
called
heelandtoe
because
you
use
one
end
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
other
on
the
throttle
to
match
revs
for
the
downshift
in
many
modern
cars
this
is
a
misnomer
often
you
must
use
the
ball
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
side
on
the
throttle
note
that
some
race
car
drivers
will
skip
the
clutch
and
just
use
the
left
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
foot
on
the
throttle
accomplishing
the
same
thing
q
what
is
doubleclutch
downshifting
a
while
your
right
foot
is
doing
the
above
your
left
foot
can
do
one
of
three
things
nothing
declutch
once
or
declutch
twice
the
reason
for
declutching
twice
is
to
match
the
speeds
of
the
two
shafts
in
the
transmission
to
the
speed
of
the
engine
this
is
usually
coupled
with
revmatching
so
that
while
the
engine
is
in
neutral
and
the
clutch
engaged
the
throttle
is
blipped
and
both
shafts
of
the
transmission
speed
up
the
procedure
is
as
follows
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
neutral
engage
clutch
match
revs
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
next
lower
gear
engage
clutch
this
sounds
like
a
lot
of
work
but
with
practice
it
becomes
natural
the
problem
that
doubleclutching
solves
is
normally
the
function
of
the
synchronizers
within
the
gearbox
in
transmissions
without
synchros
or
with
very
worn

doubleclutching
makes
it
much
easier
to
shift
basically
if
you
doubleclutch

q
what
do
the
numbers
for
acceleration
from
mile
skidpad
and
slalom
times
in
the
auto
magazines
really
mean
may
they
be
compared
a
in
short
not
as
much
as
the
magazines
want
you
to
believe
and
almost
never
in
more
detail
the
acceleration
numbers
and
mile
times
in
the
us
may
be
vaguely
compared
as
long
as
they
all
come
from
the
same
source
testing
procedures
vary
so
much
from
magazine
to
magazine
that
comparing
a
road
track
number
to
a
car
driver
number
is
quite
pointless
keep
in
mind
too
that
the
same
variation
applies
from
driver
to
driver
on
the
street
the
driver
is
a
major
often
the
major
part
of
the
equation
skidpads
vary
and
even
if
they
didnt
skidpad
figures
are
really
only
tests
of
the
stickiness
of
the
stock
tires
they
change
radically
when
tire
compounds
change
do
not
make
any
assumptions
about
the
comparative
handling
of
say
two
sports
sedans
based
on
skidpad
numbers
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
skidpads
are
without
value
however
skidpads
are
an
excellent
educational
tool
at
driving
schools
they
are
simply
of
limited
value
in
the
comparison
of
anything
except
tires
slalom
times
are
slightly
more
useful
they
test
some
small
parts
of
the
automobiles
transient
response
however
they
are
also
heavily
influenced
by
the
stock
rubber
on
the
car
and
they
do
not
test
many
corners
of
the
cars
envelope
they
do
not
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
before
making
a
buying
decision
for
example
they
dont
tell
you
what
the
rear
end
of
the
car
will
do
on
a
road
which
suddenly
goes
offcamber
when
a
car
has
an
adjustable
suspension
these
tests
are
usually
done
in
the
sport
setting
which
may
be
quite
unsuitable
for
daily
driving
the
list
of
caveats
could
go
on
for
page
after
page
q
my
buddy
claims
that
wide
tires
dont
make
any
difference
according
to
his
freshman
physics
textbook
and
that
you
cant
ever
accelerate
or
corner
at
more
than
does
he
know
what
hes
talking
about
a
in
short
he
hasnt
got
a
clue
in
more
detail
the
equations
for
friction
used
in
freshman
physics
textbooks
presume
that
the
surfaces
are
smooth
dry
and
nondeformable
none
of
which
properly
apply
to
tire
traction
except
in
the
case
of
a
stone
cold
tire
on
dry
pavement
which
is
far
below
its
proper
operating
temperature
pavement
is
never
smooth
it
is
always
irregular
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
tires
which
are
not
really
dry
and
solid
as
rubber
is
a
substance
which
in
its
natural
form
is
liquid
and
which
has
only
been
coerced
into
a
semblance
of
solidity
by
chemical
magic
deform
to
match
the
surface
of
the
pavement
which
a
vehicle
is
traveling
over
in
a
tire
at
operating
temperature
grip
is
actually
generated
by
shear
stresses
inside
the
deformed
rubber
and
not
by
anything
even
remotely
resembling
friction
in
the
freshman
physics
sense
of
the
term
the
colder
a
tire
is
relative
to
its
operating
temperature
the
closer
its
behaviour
will
be
to
the
traditional
concept
of
friction
if
much
hotter
than
the
its
proper
operating
temperature
the
more
likely
the
possibility
of
some
part
of
the
tire
actually
reverting
to
liquid
which
is
mostly
like
to
happen
deep
in
the
tread
causing
characteristic
blisters
and
chunking
this
latter
though
is
almost
completely
unlikely
to
happen
in
normal
street
driving
so
unless
youre
a
competition
driver
or
do
a
lot
of
high
speed
track
driving
dont
worry
about
it
because
tire
traction
is
completely
out
of
the
domain
of
simple
friction
it
does
not
obey
the
freshman
physics
equation
at
all
thus
dragsters
accelerate
at
more
than
and
race
cars
corner
and
brake
at
more
than
because
simple
friction
does
not
apply
it
is
actually
possible
for
different
sized
contact
patches
to
generate
differing
amounts
of
grip
an
actual
analysis
of
tire
behavior
would
require
techniques
such
as
finite
element
analysis
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
mechanism

many

want

for
their

rather
fewer
know
how
to
do
it
this

will
provide
the
essential
information
for
doing
so
on
standard
unix

a
shell

and
examples
of
alias

are
included
which
presently
run
on
a

here
at
balltowncmacom
for
a
number
of

note
that
if
you
do
set
up
an
automotive
mailing
list
please
let
me
know
of
the
request
address
so
that
i
can
list
it
in

for
this

first
of
all
to
get
anywhere
you
need
to
either
be
a
sysadmin
or
have
some
measure
of
assistance
from
your
sysadmin
it
is
also
important
that
you
have
reasonably
good
network
connectivity
if
it
seems
like
you
get
everything
several
days
after
anyone
else
or
that
you
have
trouble
getting
email
through
then
your
network
connectivity
is
probably
not
good
enough
listserv
there
is
a
handy
automated
mailing
list
package
named
listserv
which
is
available
from
several
ftp
servers
on
the
network
details
of
the
installation
and
operation
of
listserv
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
but
anyone
who
is
considering
running
a
large
mailing
list
should
probably
look
at
listserv
carefully
the
alias
file
on
a
typical
unix
system
there
is
a
file
named
usrlibaliases
on
whichever
file
server
is
your
mail
host
it
contains
lines
such
as
foo
bar
baz
bletch
which
means
that
any
email
sent
the
name
foo
on
that
host
is
redistributed
to
users
bar
baz
and
bletch
thus
the
simplest
possible
email
list
is
myfavoritecar
myaddress
myfavoritecarrequest
myaddress
this
has
a
couple
of
problems
the
most
noticeable
one
being
that
you
have
to
be
superuser
to
edit
the
alias
file
however
you
can
do
the
following
with
the
connivance
of
your
sysadmin
myfavoritecar
includehomemydirmiscautosmyfavoritecarlist
myfavoritecarrequest
myaddress
where
the
file
specified
is
a
list
of
comma
and
newline
separated
addresses
this
file
can
be
in
the
list
admins
home
directory
owned
by
the

admin
bounced
mail
this
still
has
a
problem
bounced
mail
usually
gets
distributed
to
all
the
members
of
the
list
which
is
generally
considered
somewhat
irritating
therefore
the
way
that
the
driving
school

set
up
is
instructive

you
as

happy
behavior
the
earlier
cars
are
even
more
prone
to

the

cars
used
low

engines
and
suffered
a

in

the

for

or
for

other
than
i
was

due

i
fail

especially
if
this

is
riding
your

intentionally
blocking
a

riding
your

is
certainly
not
a
wise
driving
practice
it
only
causes

to
become

actually
watch

closing

try

avoid
getting
caught
up
in
situation
such
as
you
decribe
usually
either
traffic
is
just
building
and
i
have
to
deal
with
this
fact
of
life
or
i
wait
to
a
slow
passer
to
complete
their
pass
and
make
way
for
the
pack
to
clear
if
someone
decides
then
to
pull
up
on
my

signal
my
intention

move
to
the
right
and
do
so
at
the
first
opportunity
hope
they
will
open
the
jam
i
feel
this
is
not
only
courteous
driving
but
alot
safer
than
the
actions
you
advocate
there
are
actually
many
courteous
drivers
on
the
road
who
do
not
intentionally
impede
others
if
someone
in
front
of
me
seems
to
be
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
they
are
blocking
traffic
i
use
my
blinker

flash
my

if
all
else
fails
will
briefly
speed
up
slow
down

re
rfiart
of
clutchless
shifting
writes
im
wondering
if
anybody
else
out
there
is
a
clutchless
shifter
ive
been
doing
it
my
self
over
miles
on
my
current
toyota
truck
ive
got
over
ive
heard
people
talk
about
how
doing
this
can
damage
a
transmission
my
experiences
suggest
otherwise
what
techniques
do
you
use
yeah
i
dont
use
the
clutch
all
the
time
either
ive
done
it
with
fords
bmw
datsun
and
chevy
and
it
works
fine
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
that
it
would
damage
the
tranny
essentially
you
are
just
doing
what
the
synchros
do
anyhow
match
the
engine
speed
with
the
tranny
speed
and
slip
it
into
gear
on
some
old
pieces
of
junk
i
drove
the
transmission
was
so
worn
that
pumping
the
clutch
was
the
only
way
to
shift
except
clutchless
to
date
ive
driven
rabbits
datsuns
comets
fords
a
chevy
some
where
harder
than
others
to
shift
but
generally
the
higher
the
milage
the
smoother
quicker
easier
they
where
to
shift
my
technique
is
to
ease
back
off
the
throttle
and
at
the
same
time
gently
wrist
back
on
the
shift
lever
if
for
some
reason
i
miss
the
shift
window
i
lightly
press
the
accelerator
try
agian
ive
found
that
clutchless
shifting
is
eaiserquicker
at
high
rpms
i
also
skip
gears
some
times
using
sounds
about
right
i
usually
slip
it
out
during
throttledown
and
then
blip
the
throttle
and
wait
until
it
feels
like
things
are
right
usually
about
a
second
and
then
slip
it
into
gear

snot
nosed

decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
yes
nobody
is
watching
them
if
they
get
caught
there
is
no
punishment
at
all
in
the
old
days
such
behaviour
would
be
rewarded
with
a
whipping
with
a
goodsized
belt
and
then
taken
into
some
hospital
to
see
first
hand
what
kind
of
damage
such
accidents
cause
of
course
this
doesnt
happen
any
more
that
whipping
would
probably
save
the
kids
life
by
teaching
him
some
respect
for
others
a
person
with
that
little
respect
would
inevitably
wind
up
dead
early
anyway
the
problem
is
creeping
gradualism
if
you
put
a
frog
into
hot
water
he
just
jumps
out
but
if
you
put
him
into
cold
water
and
then
everso
gradually
heat
it
the
frog
will
cook
this
is
what
the
entertainment
industry
and
lack
of
religious
moral
and
educational
standards
in
our
modern
north
american
society
have
done
to
us
over
the
years
now
that
we
are
about
to
be
cooked
we
may
have
woken
up
too
late
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
and
the
education
system
and
the
religious
leaders
arent
doing
much
about
it
either
with
both
parents
working
in
this
society
where
is
the
stabilizing
influence
at
home
latchkey
children
are
everywhere
and
these
latchkey
kids
can
watch
whatever
rotten
videos
and
listen
to
whatever
violent
hatepromoting
music
and
videos
they
like
because
no
one
is
home
to
stop
it
this
day
and
age
when
there
is
about
times
more
things
to
learn
than
when
i
went
to
school
our
answer
to
this
increased
knowledge
is
shorter
school
hours
and
more
leisure
time
i
say
keep
the
kids
in
school
longer
feed
them
good
food
and
teach
them
something
and
when
they
get
home
have
a
parent
there
to
interact
and
monitor
them
there
is
a
very
old
and
now
forgotten
proverb
a
child
left
on
his
own
will
bring
a
parent
to
grief
daycare
systems
are
not
the
answer
this
is
just
shifting
the
parents
own
responsibilities
off
on
someone
else
to
whom
its
not

the
converter

you
more
acceleration
vs
locked

clutch
than
its
inherent
losses
take
away
the
transmission
in
my

contradicts
both
your
assertions
i
get
much
stronger
acceleration
if
i
let
the
convertor
lockup
which
i
can
induce
by
briefly
lifting
off
then
quickly
but
not
too
quickly
to
trigger
a
kickdown
applying
throttle
above
rpms
the
convertor
will
never
unlock
it
would
kickdown
first
who
says
theres
no
skill
involved
in
driving
an
automatic
i
think
of
it
as
the
throttle
and
shifter
combined
into
a

pedal
with

can
pretty
much
influence

i
am
beyond
the
under
age
group
but
i
have
an
experience
a
few
years
ago
that
might
be
interesting
to
you
i
owned
a
toyota
celica
gt
i
decided
to
buy
myself
a
gift
a
more
exotic
car
front
runners
included
the
toyota
supra
turbo
and
the
porsche
model
years
i
narrowed
it
down
to
those
two
i
liked
the
simplicity
and
handling
and
snob
appeal
too
of
driving
a
porsche
the
supra
turbo
was
less
money
and
had
more
features
and
performance
almost
a
personal
luxury
car
it
had
better
acceleration
and
a
higher
top
speed
than
the
i
was
almost
ready
to
give
in
to
a
buying
impulse
for
the
but
i
decided
to
stop
by
my
insurance
agents
office
on
the
way
i
asked
about
what
would
happen
to
my
rate
with
either
car
if
you
buy
the
supra
your
rate
classification
will
be
the
same
as
the
celica
the
celica
was
considered
a
subcompact
and
for
that
year
was
rated
as
one
of
the
safest
cars
with
a
slight
increase
because
the
car
will
be
years
newer
our
lowerrisk
division
will
continue
to
handle
your
account
if
you
buy
the
porsche
well
have
to
change
you
to
the
standard
higher
rate
company
and
your
rate
will
double
and
if
you
go
with
a
its
another
story
again
well
cover
the
rest
of
this
year
but
cancel
you
after
that
but
the
supra
is
much
faster
than
the
and
the
is
actually
faster
than
the
standard
that
doenst
make
sense
thats
what
the
book
says
we
dont
insure
corvettes
either
for
some
reason
the
underwriters
consider
supras
and
their
drivers
as
very
traditional
and
conservative
i
eventually
went
with
the
supra
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
porsche
dealer
had
a
nice
salesman
to
get
me
interested
but
a
tough
highpressure
guy
in
the
back
room
at
equal
monthly
payments
it
would
have
taken
a
year
longer
to
pay
for
the
porsche
plus
its
higher
insurance
i
concluded
that
the
high
insurance
was
related
to
probability
of
auto
theft
everyones
entitled
to
my
opinion
goldbergoasysdtnavymil
imagination
is
more
important

hello
i
am
looking
to
slightly
increase
the
performance
of
my
honda
civic
si
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
suggest
upgrades
that
were
not
too
drastic
i
thought
that
one
of
the
easiest
upgrades
would
be
a
new
header
does
anyone
know
what
kind
of
increase
that
the
header
would
give
me
i
think
i
would
check
with
jackson

for
the
part
are
there
any
other
comparines
would
make
honda
parts
are
there
any
other
small
changes
that
can
be
easily
made
and
wont
screw
up
the
car
things
like
new
injectors
new
fuel
injection
chip
etc
i
would
welcome
any
suggestions
of
small
changes
that
would
make
a
difference
i
dont
really
want
to
change
the
cam
etc
because
i
have
heard
that
it
would
be
much
harder

so
that
the

there
was
always
a

the
biggest
hurdle
for

imho
is
not
shifting

rather
the

you
try

force
it

a

they
both
had
automatics
im
a

bigot

i
have
to
admit
that
the
transmissions
on
these
cars
were
better
shifters
than
i
am
and
yes
they
responded
very
quickly

kickdown

the
nissan
had
a

i
was
able
to
figure
out
which
gear
i
was
in
the
olds
may
have
also
but
i
dont
remember
i
believe
it
shifted
all
the
way
down
to
second
at
about
mph
when
my
foot
told
it
no
i
really
want

would
still
prefer
a

i
wont
delude
myself
into
thinking
that
i
can
outaccelerate
a

at

certainly
not

re
improvements
in
automatic
transmissions
an
excellent
automatic
can
be
found
in
the
subaru
legacy
it
switches
to
sport
mode
when
the
electronics
figure
it
not
when
the
driver
sets
the
switch
which
is
the
proper
way
to
do
it
imo
so
what
does
sport
mode
entail
several
things
revving
to
red
line
or
to
the
rev
limiter
in
the
case
of
the
legacy
delayed
upshifts
ie
if
you
lift
off
briefly
it
will
remain
in
the
low
gear
this
is
handy
if
you
are
charging
through
corners
and
would
like
to
do
without
the
distraction
of
upshifts
when
theres
another
curve
approaching
part
throttle
downshifts
based
on
the
speed
at
which
the
pedal
is
depressed
rather
than
the
position
of
the
pedal
modern
electronics
can
measure
this
very
easily
and
switch
to
sport
mode
this
is
wonderful
if
you
want
to
charge
through
a
green
light
about
to
turn
red
my
audi
senses
this
very
well
and
can
downshift
on
as
little
as
half
throttle
if
my
right
foot
is
fast
enough
also
i
think
that
a
smart
automatic
can
deliver
better
gas
mileage
than
a
dumb
driver
with
a
stick
all
else
being
equal
remember
that
the
idea
of
a
stick
being
more
economical
than
an
automatic
makes
a
big
assumption
that
the
driver
is
smart
enough
to
know
what
gear
to
use
for
each
situation
how
many
times
have
you
ridden
with
an
inattentive
driver
cruising
on
the
highway
at
in
gear
of
a
speed
how
many
of
people
who
drive
manuals
really
know
what
the
best
gear
to
use
is
for
every
conceivable
situation
im
sure
there
will
be
some
who
know
but
i
suspect
that
a
chip
controlled
automatic
with
all
possible
scenarioratio
combinations
stored
in
rom
is
likely
to
do
better
i
can
also
say
that
all
my
previous
assumptions
were
proved
wrong
after
i
got
a
car
with
instantaneous
mpg
readout
high
gear
low
revs
and
wide
open
throttle
is
more
economical
than
low
gear
high
revs
and
small
throttle
opening
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
if
one
sits
down
to
think
about
it
but
not
that
obvious
at

automatic

it
cant
be
half
bad
this
mclaren
autotransmission
i
still
think
its
only
half
auto
but
you
may
be
right
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
gm
chrysler
volvo
or
whatever
auto
transmission
its
a
normal
manual
transmission
gearbox
with
clutch
and
all
but
there
are
servo
motors
which
do
the
shifting
that
means
there
is
no
power
loss
in
the
drivetrain
if
you
take
out
minimal
mechanical
friction
and
the
samiauto
transmissions
ferrari
williams
mclaren
dont
tell
you
when
to
shift
either
however
these
transmissions
share
an
important
disadvantage
with
your
stock

they
are
expensive
as
long
as
these
servoshifted
gearboxes
arent
available

im

i
just

lose

maybe
in

then
i

montreal
protocol
which
has

the
cause
of
the
montreal
protocol
was
all
the
research
done
on
the
causes
of
the
ozone
depletion
problem
someone
asked
earlier
about
why
the
governments
were
working
so
fast
to
ban
the
ozonedepleting
cfc
chemicals
and
not
gasolines
and
other
greenhousegasproducing
compounds
the
greenhouse
effect
produced
by
infraredtrapping
gasses
like
and
methane
and
the
ozonehole
problem
produced
by
longlived
chlorinecontaining
molecules
are
not
the
same
thing
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
do
something
about
not
using
the
cfcs
chlorofluorocarbons
than
it
is
to
stop
producing
and
methane
which
are
natural
byproducts
of
combustion
and
of
living
animal
organisms
planting
more
trees
and
not
destroying
so
many
existing
trees
would
help
the
greenhousegas
problem
but
would
do
nothing
for
the
ozone
problem

hey

why
arent
you

you
used
to

now
none
at

in

they
make

they

it
looks

but
actually
its

designed

be

mean
its
not
based
on
any

nissan
had
better
consider
to
sell

here
after
buying
my

really
loving
it
i
would
like
to
buy
another

product
for
my

but
prefer
a
wagon
ive
owned
minivans
and
dont
prefer
them
how
about
an
altima
wagon
or
a
sentra
wagon
would
do
sounds
nice
but
i
doubt
they
have
a
plan
coz
avenil
was
introduced
to
replace
any
sedan
based
wagon
or
heres
an
even
better
suggestion
why
dont
you
guys
go
ahead
and
buy
the
rest
of
fuji
heavy
industries
subaru
and
put
either
an
inline
or
into
the

wagon
id
buy
the
legacy
in

if
it
had
a

of
the

they
seem
sentimentally
attached
to
with
all
the
camry
accord
taurus
volvo
and
subaru
wagons
out
there
its
got
to
be
a
market
segment
that
would
be
worthwhile
i
can
wait
a
year
or
two
but
if
you
dont
have
something
to
compete
by
the
model
i
may
have
to
go

incident
i
had
a

experience
recently
when
i
bought
a
new
truck
i
had
picked
out
the
vehicle
i
wanted
and
after
a
little
haggling
we
agreed
on
a
price
i
wrote
them
a
check
for
the
down
payment
plus
tax
and
license
and
told
them
id
be
back
that
evening
to
pick
up
the
truck
when
i
returned
i
had
to
wait
about
an
hour
before
the
finance
guy
could
get
to
me
when
i
finally
got
in
there
everything
went
smoothly
until
he
started
adding
up
the
numbers
he
then
discovered
that
they
had
miscalculated
the
tax
license
by
about
he
then
said
he
needed
another
from
me
i
said
we
had
already
agreed
on
a
price
and
it
was
their
problem
i
wasnt
giving
them
any
more
money
the
finance
guy
then
a
similar
thing
happend
to
me
a
year
ago
i
bought
a
used
ford
bronco
which
has
since
been
stolen
and
few
weeks
after
i
paid
and
took
delivery
they
sent
a
letter
telling
me
they
goofed
and
miscalculated
the
license
renewal
by
and
that
i
need
to
send
in
a
check
to
avoid
further
delay
in
the
processing
of
my
registration
the
thing
is
i
had
already
received
the
pink
slip
from
the
dmv
so
i
ignored
it
i
received
another
letter
and
then
the
phone
calls
started
coming
first
from
the
finance
guy
and
then
from
the
general
manager
both
hounding
me
for
the
extra
money
they
left
me
alone
once
i
told
them
i
already
had
the
paperwork
and
pointed
out
the
clause
in
the
contract
that
stated
that
the
final
price
was
just
that
final
afterall
they
wouldnt
budge
if
i
had
told
them
i
wanted
another
off
after
the
deal
had
been
signed
right
i
told
them
not
to
call
again
and
that
i
would
not
do
business
with
them
in
the
future
they
didnt
seem
to
have
a
problem
with

this
after
all
was
a
used
ford
at
a
toyota
dealership
i
had
a
much
better
experience
buying
a
new
pathfinder
about
a
month
ago
it
certainly
pays
to
buy
a
car
on
the
last
sunday
of
the
month
it
was
even
raining
too
so
they
had
done
very
little
business
that
weekend
and
were
really
willing
to
deal
i
kept
telling
them
i
would
think
about
it
and
they
kept
dropping
the
price
got
a
very
good
deal

have
been

now
all

things
are
beginning
to

the

they
still
stop

fine

once

completely
my

will
sink
another

all

feels

my

will
quit
working
one

i
checked
my
brake
fluid
and
the
reservoir
was
full
but
the
fluid
itself
looked
really
dirty

dirty

i
called
my

i
need
a

will
cost

right
now
i
have
an

a
good

not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking

selling
it
in

two
years

dropping

drops

buy

ive
always

stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking

a

my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i

i
get

my

and
what
are
good
prices
also
what
would

look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait

im
to
get
the

lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other

lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
in
my
area
denver
if
you
look
around
alittle
you
can
get
an
for
or
less
not
much
less
you
said
your
not
looking
to
go
fast
they
are
a
really
nice
car
just
not
real
powerful
in
addition
to
restricted
mileage
many
classic
insurance
carriers
also
require

be
driven
fast
they
drive
goddamn
rabbits
at
mph
in
europe
pal
and
i
reckon
a
taurus
is
at
least
as
capable
as
a
rabbit
my
whole
point
was
not
to
say
that
the
cars
couldnt
go
that
fast
but
that
they
shouldnt
go
that
fast
a
family
sedan
designed
to
be
operable
at
doesnt
suddenly
become
operable
at
because
you
added
some
plastic
aero
effects
slightly
wider
tires
and
a
much
larger
engine
thats
what
the
sho
is
a
slightly
modified
family
sedan
with
a
powerful
engine
they
didnt
even
bother
improving
the
brakes
the
mustang
is
essentially
the
same
deal
as
the
sho
a
big
power
plant
stuck
in
a
midsize
sedan
with
almost
no
other
modifications
i
have
reallife
experience
with
the
mustang
it
handles
like
a
brick
except
when
youre
invoking
oversteer
of
course
something
i
personally
avoid
doing
on
the
highway
and
stopping
power
is
inadequate
even
from
lots
of
accelleration
but
the
rest
of
the
car
is
not
up
to
par
i
picked
the
porsche
example
because
they
are
designed
with
speed
in
mind
it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
several
mercedes
or
audi
models
all
of
these
cars
are
fairly
expensive
but
so
are
the
parts
that
make
them
drivable
at
high
speed
this
should
be
elementary
there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
about
europe
since
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledge
is
admittedly
secondhand
but
i
believe
the
following
to
be
true
drivers
are
much
better
disciplined
in
europe
than
they
are
here
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying
to
me
theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owners
doing
nearly
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
some
people
have
no
respect
for
their

impatiently
riding
bumpers
the
slug
at
the
front
of
the
pack
will
miraculously
wake
up

lanes
and
viola
no
more
jam
granted
the
situation
here
does
not
apply
to
rush
hour
in
a
crowded
city
but
i
have
observed
this
situation
regularly
on
your
average
interstate
six
or
eight
sets
of
cars
side
by
side
bunched
up
in
a
pack
with
open
freeway
fore
and
aft
as
far
as
you
can
see
the
people
who
refuse
to
yeild
as
a
point
of
honor
are
just
as
annoying
as
the
slug
in
the
front
i
agree
that
if
traffic
is
all
blocked
up
and
you
want
to
pass
you
might
not
feel
like
moving
over
for
someone
behind
you
because
you
dont
want
to
give
them
that
one
carlength
when
they
should
just
wait
like
you
are
but
if
youre
one
of
those
people
that
just
sits
behind
the
person
and
doesnt
flash
them
with
the
high
beams
or
pull
left
and
flash
them
or
ride
their
bumper
or
otherwise
tell
them
that
you
do
in
fact
want
to
go
by
and
youre
not
just
drafting
them
then
get
the
hell
out
of
the
way
of
someone
who
will
i
especially
hate
it
when
you
flash
someone
at
the
back
of
a
line
and
they
dont
pass
it
on
so
after
ive
flashed
my
lights
at
the

in

he
doesnt
pass
it
on

few
if
any

when

this

it

important
to

the

why
is
it
that
the

in

jeep

called

for
a

they
hold
their
value
well
and
are
very
easy
to
resell

cost
right
around

i
didnt
blow
money

sahara

renegade
which
i
have
a

sahara
and
paid
new
including
the
rebate
are
just
wranglers
with
fancy
inside
stuff
after
driving
a
for
years
that
fancy
stuff
is
pretty
nice
the
cars
are
primitive
ride
like
a
dump
truck
etc
but
if
you
live
in
an
area
that
gets
around
of
snow
per
winter
youd
have
one
too
theyll
go
anywhere
with
a

and
are
easy
to
get
parts
for
the
i
like
my

but
when
doing
some
serious
off
roading
it
cant
keep
up
with
a

of

clearance

the
mustang
is
essentially
the
same
deal
as
the
sho
a
big
power
the
mustang
is
a
much
worse
case
of
design
irresponsibility
than
the
sho
plant
stuck
in
a
midsize
sedan
with
almost
no
other
modifications
i
have
reallife
experience
with
the
mustang
it
handles
like
a
brick
except
when
youre
invoking
oversteer
of
course
something
i
its
hard
to
predicatbaly
drift
a
stock
mustang
because
of
the
suspension
personally
avoid
doing
on
the
highway
and
stopping
power
is
inadequate
even
from
lots
of
accelleration
but
the
rest
of
the
car
is
not
up
to
par
yes
when
i
think
mustang
i
think
schoolbus
motor
in
my
mind
the
mustang
should
be
fitted
with
a
speed
limiter
at
or
so
it
just
isnt
safe
check
out
your
local
junkyard
mustangs
outnumber
other
cars
by
a
proportion
way
in
excess
of
sales
in
junkyards
i
find
it
astonishing
the
cu
or
somesuchlike
has
not
jumped
on
the
mustang
for
poor
brakes
in
relation
to
power
ford
should
at
least
standardize
on
the
svo
rear
brakes
for
all
i
picked
the
porsche
example
because
they
are
designed
with
speed
in
mind
it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
several
mercedes
or
audi
models
all
of
these
cars
are
fairly
expensive
but
so
are
the
parts
that
make
them
drivable
at
high
speed
this
should
be
elementary
there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
about
europe
since
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledge
is
admittedly
secondhand
but
i
believe
the
following
to
be
true
drivers
are
much
better
disciplined
in
europe
than
they
are
here
true
of
northern
europe
latin
countries
are
something
else
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
kindof
true
remember
they
were
build
by
adolf
in
the
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
yes
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
autobahn
is
the
german
word
for
freeway
other
countries
have
different
names
for
loose
equivalents
autostrada
autoroute
motorway
etc
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying
to
me
theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
europe
did
seem
on
the
brink
of
a
limit
it
hasnt
passed
as
far
as
i
know
typical
speeds
in
western
europe
are
much
higher
than
the
us
law
enforcement
is
negligible
in
my
experience
comapred
to
the
us
as
there
is
no
revenue
enhancement
motivation
the
things
you
really
notice
are
the
higher
speed
differentials
and
the
more
professional
attitude
to
driving
you
just
never
see
two
cars
running
parallel
at
mph
oblivious
to
all
around
them
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owners
doing
nearly
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
some
people
youre
wrong
gtis
go
this
fast
just
kind
of
noisy
not
the
ideal
autobahn
car
a
lot
of
times
you
see
cars
being
driven
with
the
drivers
foot
on
the
floor
how
do
i
know
when
youre
not
making
any
ground
on
the
identical
car
in
front
of
you
have
no
respect
for
their
own
lives
if
something
happens
at
youre
dead
but
the
same
goes
for
much
over
driving
at
high
speed
forces
you
to
concentrate
i
feel
much
safer
driving
on
the
autobahn
than
in
typical
us
traffic
because
most
people
seem
to
be
awake
ive
never
seen
any
driver
reading
a
book
on
an
autobahn
i
see
it
all
too
often
in
the
us
craig
it
just
doesnt
seem
fast
after
minutes
or
so
of
aclimation
everybody
drives
that
fast
no

they
liked
the

and
the
best
of
all
and
the
was
way
down
the
list
except
for

i
just
looked
at
that
article
first
of
all
this
summary
is
inaccurate
of
cars
the
was
right
behind
these
mentioned
and
the
suzuki
swift
as
has
been
pointed
out
it
was
a
semisilly
comparison
the
saturn
was
at
least
cheaper
than
the
and
escort
admittedly
negligible
but
an
issue
and
less
than
the
honda
the
stated
goal
was
a
base
under
the
honda
was
over
while
the
at
the
same
price
was
excluded
in
other
words
they
let
the
best
honda
play
but
not
the
best
saturn
note
that
the
saturn
did
beat
the
i
dont
know
about
the
car
comparison
but
as
far
as
the
price
goes
rest
assured
that
the
street
prices
for
the
and
escort
and
maybe
even
the
honda
will
be
lesser
than
that
of
the
saturn
youre
talking
about
all
price
comparisons
ive
seen
are
based
on
msrp
and
of
course
the
saturn
dealer
will
sell
the

for

the

will

we
slowed
down

after
looking

standing
there
we
drove
on
to

she
did

the

we
are

the

sits
up
high
on

it

for

in

he
is
gone

knock

it

to
give

a

i
reminded
him
that
i
was

i
didnt

i
should

and
that
if
he

he

he
made

so
i
told

where
he
could
stick
it
snatched
back
my
check
and
left
needless
to
say
they
were
not
pleased
by
the
turn
of
events
thats
nothing
when
a
friend
of
mine
went
shopping
for
a
small
sedan
a
few
years
ago
she
brought
me
along
as
a
token
male
so
the
salespeople
wouldnt
give
her
the
bimbo
treatment
her
first
choice
was
a
mazda
and
second
choice
was
a
nissan
sentra
we
went
to
a
mazda
dealership
and
described
what
we
wanted
we
started
negotiating
on
the
price
and
the
salesdroid
kept
playing
the
let
me
run
this
price
by
the
sales
manager
after
playing
the
good
salesman
bad
salesman
game
we
finally
told
him
that
if
he
didnt
have
the
authority
to
negotiate
a
price
perhaps
we
should
be
speaking
directly
to
someone
who
did
he
brought
in
the
sales
manager
who
proceeded
to
dick
us
around
with
every
trick
in
the
book
read
remar
suttons
dont
get
taken
every
time
for
a
list
finally
after
playing
a
few
more
rounds
of
youll
have
to
work
with
us
on
this
price
also
known
as
each
time
you
come
up
a
thousand
dollars
well
come
down
ten
the
salesmanager
gave
a
signal
to
his
two
sales
cronies
stood
up
and
said
well
we
cant
come
down
any
more
so
i
guess
we
cant
help
you
and
they
trouped
out
of
the
room
leaving
us
sitting
in
the
salesmans
office
all
by
ourselves
hmm
id
read
that
sleazy
salesmen
sometimes
bug
their
own
offices
so
they
can
leave
and
listen
in
on
couples
discussing
the
sales
offer
and
i
mentioned
this
aloud
to
my
friend
while
we
were
sitting
there
wondering
why
they
would
leave
us
in
the
office
instead
of
showing
us
to
the
door
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
i
picked
up
the
phone
on
the
desk
and
called
another
mazda
dealership
asked
for
a
salesman
and
began
discussing
what
kind
of
price
they
would
consider
a
few
sentences
into
the
conversation
mr
salesmanager
broke
into
the
line
and
began
telling
me
how
rude
he
thought
it
was
that
i
would
call
another
dealership
from
his
phone
i
said
that
since
hed
announced
that
our
business
was
over
he
shouldnt
care
and
every
time
i
tried
to
talk
to
the
other
sales
guy
the
sales
manager
would
drown
out
our
voices
with
his
own
how
did
he
know
that
i
was
using
the
phone
anyway
finally
i
hung
up
and
we
headed
out
of
the
showroom
sales
manager
and
cronies
come
out
of
a
little
unmarked
room
and
he
begins
to
berate
us
again
we
say
that
we
wont
bother
him
anymore
were
going
next
door
to
the
nissan
dealership
then
comes
the
part
i
wish
i
could
have
videotaped
as
we
go
out
the
front
door
the
sales
manager
shouts
across
the
entire
showroom
customers
and
all
go
ahead
you
deserve
to
buy
a
nissan
so
my
friend
bought
a
sentra
just
so
the
guilty
wont
go
unpunished
ill
mention
that
the
sales
managers
name
was
gary
tusone
from
his
manner
his
refusal
to
come
down
to
a
reasonable
price
and
his
anger
at
the
end
my
guess
is
that
he
had
bet
our
original
salesman
who
was
a
young
novice
that
hed
be
able
to
get
at
least
x
dollars
out
of
us
and
he
was
steamed
that
we
wouldnt
fall

his
slimy
tricks

i
wish
i

the
figures

me
to
back

up

i
recall
statistics
showing
that
women
tended
to
have
more
accidents
than
men
but
the
damage
was
generally
quite
minor
men
had
fewer

far
more
expensive
accidents
the
rate
of
total
vehicle
destruction
was
significantly
higher
for
men
than
women
particularly
in
the
younger
male
age
groups
imho
social
considerations
are
probably
the
strongest
influence
here
possibly
more
so
than
any
difference
between
the
sexes
social
influences
often
affect
the
type
of
car
thats
bought
and
the
situations
the
car
is
used
in
and
the
type
of
car
and
driving
situations
have
a
major
effect
on
accident
risk
thus
if
society
expects
you
to
buy
a
mustang
and
race
it
on
the
street
youre
more
likely
to
do
it
and
our
society
expects
that
of
males
more
than
females
i
agree
with
some
of
your
social
influences
such
as
driving
conditions
but
lets
get
real
here
guys
dont
drag
race
becuase
there
expected
too
we
do
it
becuase
its
fun
and
we
find
out
whose
car
is
faster
guys
drive
different
than
women
becuase
there
men
when
a
driver
is
driving
unusually
i
can
usually
figure
out
if
it
is
a
male
or
female
driver
without
looking
at
the
driver
social
influences
may
give
a
person
more
reason
to
buy
a
vehicle
that
has
a
certain
amount
of
character
which
he

taking
an

exit
to
another

my

suddenly
screamed

something
large
hit
the
side
of
my

we
slowed
down
but
after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to
the
police
station
she
did
get
a
good
look
at
the
guy
and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock
but
i
never
saw
him
we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have

gxe
for

the

has

about
miles
on
it
a
typical
mileage
for
cars
seem
to
be
about
km

about

the
seller
just
informed
me
that
when

brought
the
car
in

certification
he
was
told
that
the
front
break
pads
and
the
exhausts
had
to
be
replaced
to
meet
the
legal
standards
he
said
he
will
replace
the
components
before
selling
the
car
to
me
being
copmletely
ignorant

on

i
dont

what
this
could

is
km
about
the
time
typical
for
replacing
the
above
mentioned
items
or
is
this
an
indication
that
the
car
was
abused
would
other
things
break
down
or
have
to
be
replaced
soon
the
seller
told
me
that
he
used
the
car
on
the
highway
a
lot
but
i
dont
know
how
to
verify
this
ive
seen
the
paint
chipped
away
in
tiny
dots
in
the
front
edge
of
the
hood
though
although
the
maxima
is
an
excellent
car
and
the
car
is
very
clean
and
well
kept
its
currently
out
of
warranty
a
similarly
priced
accord
with
km
will
have
years
or
km
worth
of
warranty
left
and
i
dont
want
to
worry
about
paying
for
any
repair
bills
but
i
also
need
a
car
for
people
when
will
the

this

the

these

the

swift
as

the

was
at

cheaper
than
the
and
escort
admittedly
negligible
but
an

and
less
than
the

the
stated
goal
was
a
base
under
the
honda
was
over
while
the
at
the

price
was
excluded
in
other
words
they
let
the

play

not
the

saturn
note
that
the
saturn
did
beat
the
i
dont
know
about
the
car
comparison
but
as
far
as
the
price
goes
rest
assured
that
the
street
prices
for
the

and
maybe
even
the
honda
will
be
lesser
than
that
of
the

youre
talking
about
all
price
comparisons
ive
seen
are
based
on
msrp
and
of
course
the
saturn
dealer
will
sell
the

for
sticker
price
whereas
the

will
do
it

below

i
dont
know
about
trains
but
ive
saw
a
sign
on
the
back
of
a
greyhound
bus
that
warns
you
that
your
radar
detector
may
be
set
off
it
doesnt
explain
why
but
it
does
set
off
my
radar
detector
because
greyhound
has
apparently
gotten
around
to
installing
their
radar
collisionprevention
system
they
use
radar
to
monitor
how
close
other
vehicles
are
and
how
fast
their
relative
speeds
are
and
signals
a
warning
to
the
driver
if
theyre
coming
up
on
something
too
fast
or
are
getting
too
close
this
is
all
i
remember
from
the
news
reports
a
few
months
back
at
the
time
they
were
only
talking
about
the
possibility
of
installing
the
system
they
didnt
mention
how
it
worked
in
bumpertobumper
traffic

how
it
discriminated
between
a
camaro
approaching

ye
olde

do

something
about

hi
maybe
someone
can
help
me
here
i
am
looking
to
buy
this
nissan
maxima
gxe
for
right
now
so
its
an
automatic
dont
know
if
us
speccdn
spec
for
maximas
the
car
has
km
or
about
miles
on
it
a
typical
mileage
for
cars
seem
to
be
about
km
or
about
mi
the
seller
just
informed
me
that
when
he
brought
the
car
in
for
certification
he
was
told
that
the
front
break
pads
and
the
exhausts
had
to
be
replaced
to
meet
the
legal
standards
he
said
he
will
replace
the
components
before
selling
the
car
to
me
being
copmletely
ignorant
to
the
technical
stuff
on
cars
i
dont
know
what
this
could
mean
is
km
about
the
time
typical
for
replacing
the
above
mentioned
items
or
is
this
an
indication
that
the
car
was
abused
if
it
is
the
first
set
of
brake
pads
on
front
then
this
is
fine
my
car
eats
a
set
every
miles
or
so
the
fact
that
he
is
replacing
the
muffler
too
is
also
ok
would
other
things
break
down
or
have
to
be
replaced
soon
the
mileage
is
fairly
low
but
typical
fwd
stuff
is
cv
joints
check
the
maintenance
records
with
the
manufacturers
requirements
for
valve
adjustments
timing
belt
changes
and
so
on
the
mile
service
is
often
expensive
so
make
sure
he
has
done
everything
the
seller
told
me
that
he
used
the
car
on
the
highway
a
lot
but
i
dont
know
how
to
verify
this
ive
seen
the
paint
chipped
away
in
tiny
dots
in
the
front
edge
of
the
hood
though
well
this
is
one
of
the
commonly
cited
methods
for
identifying
a
car
with
highway
miles
might
check
the
gas
pedal
wear
too
ask
him
how
many
sets
of
tires
he
has
been
through
a
highway
car
might
have
squeezed
by
on
sets
a
hard
driven
car
sets
although
the
maxima
is
an
excellent
car
and
the
car
is
very
clean
and
well
kept
its
currently
out
of
warranty
a
similarly
priced
accord
with
km
will
have
years
or
km
worth
of
warranty
left
and
i
dont
want
to
worry
about
paying
for
any
repair
bills
well
the
maxima
should
be
pretty
reliable
but
if
its
out
of
warranty
you
should
get
it
checked
out
by
someone
knowledgeable
first
stuff
for
japanese
cars
can
be
expensive
but
i
also
need
a
car
for
people
when
will
the
new
maxima
come
out
by
the
way
model
year
i
believe
i
would
very
much
appreciate
your
input
in
this

im
no

dont
the

have

rod
locating

anyway
simple
strut
suspensions
like
this
can
be
lowered
just
by
using
shorter
springs
cutting
the
springs
lowering
the
spring
perch
or
shortening
the
strut
below
the
perch
in
each
of
these
cases
the
suspension
geometry
will
suffer
because
the

arms
will
not

the

a
spacer
placed
between
control
arm
and
the
bottom
of
the

roughly
the
height
of

will
restore
the

its

there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
about
europe
since
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledge
is
admittedly
secondhand
but
i
believe
the
following
to
be
true
my
knowledge
about
driving
in
the
us
is
also
secondhand
but
i
think
i
can
correct
your
statements
about
our
autobahn
drivers
are
much
better
disciplined
in
europe
than
they
are
here
oh
yeah
that
would
be
paradise
in
fact
you
can
forget
it
from
all
ive
heard
from
my
us
relatives
drivers
esp
here
in
germany
are
much
more
agg
ressive
but
not
disciplined
one
of
my
relatives
a
la
resident
hired
a
car
at
the
nuernberg
airport
and
went
about
miles
to
our
home
he
said
then
that
he
grew
about
year
older
during
this
ride
and
swore
hed
never
drive
a
car
in
germany
again
this
was
in
and
he
kept
his
promise
the
situation
now
is
even
worse
as
effect
of
the
increased
volume
of
traffic
what
you
mean
by
better
disciplined
should
perhaps
be
considered
cautious
due
to
fear
when
driving
around
here
you
always
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
the
majority
of
the
other
drivers
absolutely
relies
on
you
they
expect
that
nobody
fails
or
sleeps
many
of
them
exploit
this
by
driving
as
fast
as
their
car
can
go
of
course
only
where
that
is
allowed
you
might
think
dream
on
so
any
mistake
you
make
is
a
very
high
risk
to
your
health
and
if
youre
ex
posed
to
such
a
situation
from
your
very
first
day
as
a
driver
you
learn
to
handle
it
or
you
lose
thats
the
way
i
and
most
people
i
know
experience
our
traffic
situation
whether
you
think
this
is
pleasant
or
efficient
is
up
to
you
i
think
we
handle
a
very
high
volume
of
traffic
and
that
at
high
speeds
with
modest
compared
to
the
volume
and
decreasing
rates
of
lethal
accidents
otoh
more
and
more
people
esp
women
dislike
driving
because
they
feel
overtaxed
and
threatened
and
each
accident
is
one
accident
too
much
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
better
designed
and
maintained
may
be
but
animal
fences
are
very
rare
auto
bahnen
and
many
other
streets
have
guardrails
i
hope
thats
the
right
word
a
plank
made
from
thick
steel
sheet
fixed
on
uprights
its
about
feet
high
those
guardrails
are
designed
for
keeping
vehicles
on
the
road
smaller
animals
can
crawl
under
the
plank
bigger
ones
can
easily
jump
over
it
the
point
is
that
esp
larger
animals
are
very
rare
in
germany
they
tend
also
to
be
very
timid
accidents
caused
by
animals
are
a
neglegible
danger
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying
to
me
theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
youre
right
there
are
speed
linits
even
on
the
major
part
of
the
autobahn
but
the
attitude
towards
driving
see
above
seems
to
be
very
similar
to
that
in
germany
ive
been
in
france
switzerland
italy
austria
spain
belgium
the
netherlands
besides
that
you
really
cant
rely

the
residents

limits

of
practise
miles
and
im

i
consider
driving
on
the
highways

milano
really
a
thrill
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owners
doing
nearly
on
the

i
could
be
wrong
sorry

youll

owners
going

with

are

and
most
people
buying
such
cars
arent
afraid
to
let
them
run
some
people
have
no
respect
for
their
own
lives
i
disagree
the
size
or
weight
of
a
car
is
rather
irrelevant
cars
weigh
less
than
kg
and
the
drivers
have
a
chance
to
survive
accidents
at
mph
or
higher
otoh
when
crashing
against
a
solid
object
at
mph
it
makes
no

personal
preference
the
latter
is
probably
because
of
the
air
bag
its
pretty
much
takes
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn
speaking
of
the
horn
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
probe
comes
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sounding
horns
instead
of
the
japanese
sounding
kind
the
previous
probes
had
japanese
horns

for
i
agree
strongly
with
all
of
the
above
especially
about
the
engine
the
interior
is
very
very
nice
too
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
ergonomically
sound
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
relatively
smooth
roads
and
most
noticable
thing
is
that
the
probes
suspension
doesnt
like
potholes
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
potholed
road
somewhere
around
town
and
see
if
the
jarring
you
get
is
tolerable
yes
this
cars
stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
the
problem
with
the
back
seat
is
that
theres
no
leg
room
plenty
of
head
room
though
shorter
people
fit
back
there
without
any
complaints
so
long
as
the
seat
they
are
sitting
behind
is
pulled
forward
a
bit
to
give
them
a
place
to
put
their
feet
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passengers
now
very
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventilation
you
may
want
to
consider
that
when
combined
with
the
heat
the
power
moonroof
can
greatly
improve
the
ventilation
throughout
the
car
i
really
enjoy
the
moonroof
by
the
way
but
then
ive
always
been
a
sucker
for
open
air
driving
no
leakage
problems
or
anything
like
thatyet
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
ford
will
replace
at
no
charge
but
i
havent
heard
about
anything
like
this
concerning
the
probes
i
havent
had
any
real
trouble
with
this
car
outside
of
a
cv
joint
boot
that
was
leaking
but
the
dealer
took
care
of
that
promptly
and
even
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
was
without
my
car
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
way
they
handledespecially
considering
that
i
was
expecting
the
worst
from
them
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
hope
this

hello
netters
im
visiting

im
from

in

i
will
probably
rent
a
chevy
beretta
from
alamo
ive
been
quoted
for
a
week
for
additional
days
this
would
include
free
driving
distance
but
not
local
taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in
the
base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some
info
on
this
is
a
ripoff
probability
that
ill
be
needing
more
insurance
is

exactly
my
point
there
is
a
lot
of
hostility
to
and
from
teenagers
if
you
follow
the
news
for
the
northwest
usa
you
will
have
heard
that
a
group
of
old
boys
barely
out
of
the
teens
certainly
their
outlook
was
developed
during
their
teens
just
shot
and
killed
an
innocent
little
girl
riding
in
a
car
in
the
seattle
area
when
her
mother
who
was
driving
honked
her
horn
at
the
car
with
the
boys
in
it
this
is
really
upsetting
and
makes
my
stomach
turn
as
it
would
any
parents
doesnt
your
heart
just
go
out
to
that
poor
mother
teenagers
both
drive
cars
and
are
involved
in
automotive
vandalism
and
crime
maybe
someone
on
this
newsgroup
has
had
specific
experience
in
dealing
with
violent
teenage
offenders
like
these
kids
are
at
the
same
it
seems
sad
that
people
lose
all
perspective
when
they
here
about
a
case
of
violence
by

for
a
little
perspective
how
about
the
thousands

the

did
you
read

spent

what
about

what

if

it

be

however
if

wants
your

its
as
good
as
gone
no

what
you
do

to
slow
down
any
thieves
it
would
be
a
good

to
get
the
basic
options
that
would
be
ignition
kill
or
fuel
cutoff
a
flashing
red

these
two
are
basic
to
a
decent

to
slow
down
the

some
more
get
a

lock
that
should

to

it

criteria
a
fun
car
with
abs
airbag
over
and
less
than
i
thought
about
a
turbo
but
checking
with
insurance
people
ruled
that
out
the
tristar
cars
eclipsetalonetc
were
out
since
they
dont
have
an

ditto
for

no

the
fell

category
a

buy
the
was
almost
there
but
rolled
more
than
i
liked
i
didnt
like
the
prelude
dashinstrumentation
at
all
too
weird
for
me
the
has
a
much
smaller
nonpassenger
space
than
i
needed
so
out
that
went
the
celica
was
ok
but
underpowered
when
loaded
with
options
and
somewhat
overpriced
too
in
nonturbo
form
i
never
considered
the
since
it
didnt
have
an
airbag
i
did
look
at
it
for
its
rwd
virtues
but
thats
it
the
corolla
never
entered
my
mind
i
should
have
looked
at
the
mitsubishi
stealth
more
since
my
list
was
exhausted
i
bought
the
probe
the
car
design
is
different
than

its
too
early

its

vtec
honda
del
sol
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
relatively
smooth
roads
and
most
noticable
thing
is
that
the
probes
suspension
doesnt
like
potholes
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
potholed
road
somewhere
around
town
and
see
if
the
jarring
you
get
is
tolerable
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passengers
now
very
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventilation
you
may
want
to
consider
that
when
combined
with
the
heat
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
leather
and
the
keyless
entry
system
werent
available
when
i
got
the
car
so
i
cant
comment
on
them
i
got
the
car
before
it
was
officially
announced
i
prefer
cloth
to
leather
anyway
i
wouldnt
want
this
car
in
the
snow
the
suspension
is
too
rough
for
the
inevitable
surprise
potholes
tires
arent
meant
for
snow
and
the
seats
assume
that
youre
not
wearing
lots
of
thick
clothing
rain
is
much
better
water
generally
beads
off
the
windshield
at
freeway
speed
the
windshield
wiper
controls
are
easy
and
understandable
and
i
barely
hydroplaned
once
with
the
eagles
and
i
was
really
trying
there
is
also
a
definite
lack
of
cup
holdersmall
storage
places
the
gt
has
map
holders
below
the
speakers
in
the
door
but
theyre
rigid
plastic
that
could
fit
two
cassettes
or
cds
max
the
center
consolestorage
binarm
rest
has
cup
holder
and
the
back
of
the
front
seats
have
a
cloth
pouch
but
thats
it
no
change
holders
quite
a
letdown
from
the
sho
and
the
probe
is
definitely
not
a
peoplemover
car
or
an
econobox
car
lastly
dont
store
wet
car
covers
in
the
back
the
foam
will
soak
the
water
up
and
the
result
will
not
smell

four

i

the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
well
people
fortunatly
or
unfortunatly
only
the
us
is
experiencing
the
devaluation
of
human
life
among
developed
nations
i
am
an
american
but
i
was
raised
in
europe
where
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
somebody
is
get
his
car
broken
into
or
have
his
pocket
picked
by
slaves
or
russian
refugees
of
cource
there
will
be
some
nutcases
but
thats
extremely
rare
ie
in
greece
you
can
walk
through
any
neighborhood
at
any
time
during
the
night
without
even
worrying
in
germany
you
can
walk
the
sidewalks
at
am
and
not
even
look
behind
your
back
at
the
sanitation
crews
that
clean
the
streets
to
a
sparkling
cleen
whoever
of
you
have
been
there
you
know
what
i
am
saying
i
dont
have
any
easy
answers
but
if
we
as
a
nation
do
some
selfcritisism
we
might
get
somewhere
of
course
these
postings
sould
be

soccultureus
but
if
we
reduce
crime
here
it
ll
mean
less
car
insurance
rates
thus
we
could
spend
more

version

last
night
i
was
travelling
on
the
interstate
here
in
knoxville
i
was
taking
an
offramp
exit
to
another
interstate
and
my
wife
suddenly
screamed
and
something
large
hit
the
side
of
my
truck
we
slowed
down
but
after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to
the
police
station
she
did
get
a
good
look
at
the
guy
and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock
but
i
never
saw
him
we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have
killed
her
the
police
are
looking
for
the
guy
but
in
all
likelyhood
he
is
gone
i
am
a
very
good
driver
knock
on
wood
but
it
was
nighttime
and
i
never
saw
the
guy
the
police
said
they
thought
the
motive
was
to
hit
the
car
have
us
stop
to
check
out
the
damage
and
then
jump
us
and
take
the
truck
please
be

as
long

were
on

several

myself
and
two
others
were
riding
in
the

of
a
toyota
pickup
heading
south
on
interstate
north
of
seattle
wa
someone
threw
a
rock
of
an
overpass
and
hit
our
windshield
not
by
accident
im
sure
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
to
the
overpass
quickly
to
see
who
did
it
we
figured
it
was
kids
reported
it
and
left
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
happend
again
and
killed
a
guy
at
my
company
he
was
in
his
midfourties
and
left
behind
a

and
children
turned
out
there
was
a

for

a
few
blocks
away
they
caught
the

that
did
it
they
put
a

what
else
could
they
do
i
dont

ill
over
forget
this
story
in
des

iowa
about
a
year
ago
some
kid
dropped
a
rock
from
an
overpass
and
hit
car
just
behind
the
windshield
it
put
a
dent
in
the
roof
so
i

i
was
lucky
it
hit
metal
its

the
quality

is
something
of
a
myth
the
road
surface
isnt
much
different
to
a
typical
tx
freeway
they
are
better
in

of
lighting
safety
signs
roadmarkings

they
light
the

in

funny
everywhere
else
ive
been

only
light
em
at

i
wont
even
get
into
how
much
road
markings
vary
between
states
and
localities
except
to
say
that
there
are
some
areas
where
markings
are
essentially
nonexistant
than
most
of
the

here
a

dont

me
wrong
i

it

i
would

i
suspect
you
have
very
limited

us
freeways
vary
dramatically
particularly
between

i
can
name
a
number
of
interstate
highways
in
various
parts
of
the
country
where
would
be
very
optimistic
in
any
car
im
not
sure
what
you
call
quite
severe
in
terms
of
road
deviations
but
i
suspect
every
single
bridge
junction
on
through
ct
would
be
considered
so
theyre
hard
to
take
at
thats
not
the
only
interstate
ive
seen
with
such
deviations
but
its
one
i
drive
frequently
texas
is
pretty
much
an
edgecase
you
cant
assume
that
everywhere
has
roads
in
such
good
condition
such
flat
terrain
and
such
wideopen
spaces
it
just
aint

called

they
said
they
have
buyers
in

interested
in
my
car
or
they
wouldnt
be
talking
to
me
they
talked
to
me
for
a
good
minutes
asking
everything
about
my
car
and
said
they
could
sell
it
no
problem
they
guaranteed
that
if
they
didnt
sell
my
car
in
days
i
would
get
my
money
back
and
since
i
charged
it
im
protected
by
federal
law
which
states
that
if
im
not
satisfied
i
would
get
a
refund
which
is
true
they
federal
expressed
all
the
paperwork
to
me
which
had
a
contract
stating
their
policy
about
the
days
and
such
i
called
up
the
bbb
in
illinois
and
they
do
not
have
a
file
on
them
which
is
good
news
so
they
definitely
are
a
legitimate
company
but
so
far
its
been
over

yes
some

solved

hello
netters
im
visiting
the
us
im
from
sweden
in
august
i
will
probably
rent
a
chevy
beretta
from
alamo
ive
been
quoted
for
a
week
for
additional
days
this
would
include
free
driving
distance
but
not
local
taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in
the
base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some
info
on
this
is
a
ripoff
no
that
sounds
pretty
reasonable
for
that
car
and
that
city
probability
that
ill
be
needing
more
insurance
unless
you
have
an
accident
you
wont
need
more
if
you
plan
on
paying
for
the
car
with
a
credit
card
check
and
see
if
your
card
automatically
covers
rental
cars
also
your
own
auto
insurance
may
cover
rental
cars
also
most
rental
companies
here
offer
extra
insurance
when
you
rent
and
require
you
to
initial
in
several
spots
if
you
dont
want
it
the
credit
cards
and
personal
auto
insurance
provide
the
same
sort
of
coverage
that
the
rental
agency
is
trying
to
sell
i
have
never
rented
from
alamo
so
i
dont
know
if
they
follow
this
same
practice
is
the
beretta
a
good
rental
car
yes
it
is
a
compact
probably
a
bit
dull
performance
and

very

it
will
have

back

the

for
a
second
note
that
the
auto
tranny
in

shifts
at
the
drivers
command
not
some
preselected
schedule
the
driver
still
controls
the
shifting
not
the

now
there
is
no
dispute
that
in
production
cars
automatics
are
inherently
more
lossy
than
manuals
that
is
in
theory
my
point
all
along
is
that
whatever
mechanical
advantages
a
manual
has
over
an
automatic
can
very
easily
be
lost
by
a
driver
who
isnt
skillful
or
one
thing
that
gives
an
automatic
an
advantage
at
launch
is
the
fact
that
it
has
a
torque
converter
vs
a
clutch
i
know
this
sounds
strange
but
a
torque
converter
multiplies
the
engine
output
when
launching
it
functions
as
a
sort
of
limited
continuously
variable
transmission
typically
you
get
a
torque
multiplication
of
to
times
depending
on
the
stall
speed
i
have
yet
to
see
a
torque
multiplier
installed
on
a
production
automobile
such
systems
do
exist
but
none
are
presently
installed
in
production
autos
that
i
am
aware
of
these
are
commonly
called
viscous
drive
cvts
or
fluidic
amplifiers
contrasted
to
a
clutch
which
merely
slips
when
feathered
result
is
no
tq
mult
what
the
convertor
does
allow
is
for
the
engine
to
be
closer
to
its
torque
peak
during
the
launch
before
a
clutched
car
can
fully
engage
its
driveline
chevy
proved
it
many
years
ago
with
the
camaro
ets
and
terminal
mile
times
were
close
enough
tpo
be
identical
for
speed
and
auto
cars
note
that
this
is
also
the
major
reason
that
an
auto
car
can
get
away
with
fewer
gears
than
a
manual
the
slip
in
the
convertor
makes
up
for
the
fewer
ratios
and
before
everyone
starts
yelling
about
the
proposed
sspeed
autos
soon
to
be
out
note
that
some
manufacturers
are
using
speed
manulas
now
once
past
lauch
however
the
converter
begins
coupling
and
the

is
reduced

bbb

arbitration
my
bbb
autoline
arbitration
experience
is
over
the
outcome
was
decidedly
mixed
i
won
the
battle
but
lost
the
war
the
arbitrator
found
that
the
car
was
defective
but
decided
to
offer
a
repurchase
well
below
market
value
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
average
retail
on
my
truck
in
the
nada
book
was
but
the
decision
was
for
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
council
of
better
business
bureaus
pointing
out
the
fact
that
if
you
have
an
automobile
that
does
not
depreciate
rapidly
the
manufacturer
has
no
incentive
to
deal
with
you
there
is
no
way
that
the
manufacturer
can
loose
because
they
can
turn
around
and
sell
the
vehicle
at
a
profit
if
the
consumer
is
awarded
a
repurchase
the
attitude
of
chevrolets
representative
at
the
hearing
tends
to
support
this
point
of
view
he
was
totally
unprepared
and
did
not
seem
to
take
the
proceeding
very
seriously
i
decided
to
take
the
repurchase
even
though
i
am
getting
totally
screwed
on
the
price
i
will
not
have
to
deal
with
continuing
repairs
or
selling
a
lemon
myself
and
i
have
no
case
for
a
civil
suit
based
on
the
idaho
lemon
law
i
am
planning
to
send
a
letter
to
my
elected
representatives
telling
them
how
utterly
ridiculous
the
idaho
lemon
law
is
the
law
allows
for
a
use
deduction
equal
to
the
irs
mileage
allowance
as
if
chevrolet
were
buying
my
gas
and
paying
for
my
insurance
summary
of
the
case
in
may
i
bought
a
new
ton
hd
chevrolet
pickup
between
may
and
december
this
vehicle
required
repair
after
repair
systems
that
required
attention
included
the
transmission
heater
fan
paint
suspension
and
motor
the
main
problem
was
the
five
speed
manual
transmission
they
could
not
install
a
nondefective
transmission
in
at
least
four
attempts
so
in
summary
it
is
possible
to
get
a
repurchase
but
you
are
going
to
get
screwed
on
the
price
unless
you
paid
too
much
in
the
first
place
or
if
your
car
happens
to
be
a
model
that
depreciates
rapidly

just
shot

you

the

teenagers
both

how
does
it
compare

i
thought
the

looked
very
solid
stable
and
european
only
disappointment
so
far
is
that
that
it
doesnt

an

my
next

is
why
isnt
vw
offering
automobiles
with
airbags
should
i
pay
the
extra
three
thousand
for
a
bmw
is
even
though
it
is
smaller
and
less
powerful
than
than
the
passat
i
think
vw
got
caught
out
on
the
airbag
thing
its
only
been
in
the
last
year
or
two
that
airbags
have
become
a
significant
selling
feature
vw
assumed
that
automatic
belts
would
satisfy
govt
requirements
for
passive
restraint
but
didnt
guess
that
the
merican
consumer
would
actually
make
buy
decisions
based
on
the
presence
of
an

vw
is
really
hurting
right
now
in

check

jettas
will
be
coming
from

in

but
they
dont
have
the
quality
at
that
facility
as
per
normal
vw
practice
the

launch

the
jetta
iii
is
delayed
again
and
again
until
a
good
chunk
of
the
useful
life
of
the

is
spent
i
think
that
passats
come
from
germany
so
there
is
not
the
same
quality
and
availability
issue
its
a
nice
car
with
a
nice

whether
vw
will
be
a
player
in

in

there
owns
a
chevy
sprint
i
want
to
know
how
they
got
their
oxygen
sensors
changed
also
did
you
face
any
problem
with
fixing
it
without
the
dealers
help
also
what
are
the
results
of
the
oxygen
sensor
malfunction
any
help
would
be
greatly
apprecisted
thanks
i
sold
my
sprint
last
april
with
on
it
id
driven
it
since
the
previous
july
putting
miles
on
it
the
sensor
light
used
to
light
up
regularly
starting
about
miles
after
i
bought
it
my
brother
and
i
rebuilt
the
engine
but
used
all
of
the
original
equipment
so
i
suppose
the
sensor
could
have
used
replacement
performance
hah
if
you
could
call
it
that
did
not
change
perhaps
emissions
increased
but
how
much
emissions
could
a
caregistered
cylinder
engine
produce
that
was
a
neat
car
i
held
the
engine
block
easily
in
one
hand
has
anyone
ever
driven
the
turbo
variant
just

which
is
too
stiff
for
a

more
practicality
and
more

the
nissan
turbo
is
a
good
buy
and
for
a
good
dose
of
luxury
the
lexus
is
perfect
with
a
manual
transmission
of

however
the
toyota
supra
is
coming
out
soon
and
if
you
like
its
looks
the
performance
is
supposed
to
be
great
almost
race
car
like
i
dont
particulary
like
the
mitsubishi
or
the
dodge

they
are

ten

not

if

pick
your

of
the

this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of

i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off

and
such

pound

has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no

kids
see
hundreds
on

why
be

when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
well
people
fortunatly
or
unfortunatly
only
the
us
is
experiencing
the
devaluation
of
human
life
among
developed
nations
i
am
an
american
but
i
was
raised
in
europe
where
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
somebody
is
get
his
car
broken
into
or
have
his
pocket
picked
by
slaves
or
russian
refugees
of
cource
there
will
be
some
nutcases
but
thats
extremely
rare
ie
in
greece
you
can
walk
through
any
neighborhood
at
any
time
during
the
night
without
even
worrying
in
germany
you
can
walk
the
sidewalks
at
am
and
not
even
look
behind
your
back
at
the
sanitation
crews
that
clean
the
streets
to
a

cleen
whoever
of
you
have
been
there
you
know
what
i
am
saying
i
dont
have
any
easy
answers
but
if
we
as
a

do
some
selfcritisism
we
might
get
somewhere
of
course
these

sould

if
we
reduce

here
it

mean

i
have
never
understood
what
posessed
auto
builders
to
put
delicate
controls
which
must
be
used
with
skill
and
finesse
like
clutches
and
brakes
on
the
floor
why
not
hand
control
its
much
much
easier
in
the
early
days
neither
of
these
functions
had
powerassist
so
only
legs
had
enough
strength
to
activate
them
since
then
its
been
traditional
and
people
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
used
to
anything
else
well
where
exactly
would
you
put
a
hand
clutch
and
brake
on
a
motorcycle
its
easy
the
handlebars
have
a
very
limited
range
of
turning
steering
wheels
on
the
other
hand
turn
around
and
around
and
aroundwhich
is
fine
for
electrical
relays
like
your
cruise
control
and
airbagbut
how
many
of
you
want
to
lose
your
clutch
andor
brake
due
to
a
short
circuit
shades
of
the
edsel
they
had
pushbuttons
in
the
steering
wheel
hub
that
controlled
the
auto
tranny
it
was
very
disconcerting
to
shift
into
reverse
when
turning
a
corner
and
the
wires
shorted
there
are
workarounds
but
theres
really
no
reason
to
use
hand
power
on
a
cars
clutch
or
brakes
and
lightening
them
to
the
point
that
they
are
finesse
controls
suitable
for
hand
use
would
increse
the
mechanical
complexity
substantially
look
at
power
brakes
and
nonpower
brakes
for
an
example
i
saw
an
experimental
car
that
had
a
joystick
instead
of
a
steering
wheel
thats
about
useless
imho
another
automotive
oddity
is
separate
keys
for
trunks
doors
and
ignitions
why
on
earth
would
you
want
this
i
know
i
dont
i
want
a
separate
trunk
key
for
security
reasons
it
gives
me
a
totally

up

tell

you
pay

they

i
currently
have

i

i
never

anything

i
was
wondering
if
anyone
can
shed
any
light
on
just
how
it
is
that
these
electronic
odometers
remember
the
total
elapsed
mileage
what
kind
of
memory
is
stablereliable
enough
nonvolatile
enough
and
independent
enough
of
outside
battery
power
to
last
say
years
or
more
in
the
life
of
a
vehicle
im
amazed
that
anything
like
this
could
be
expected
to
work
for
this
length
of
time
especially
in
light
of
all
the
gizmos
i
work
with
that
are
doing
good
to
work
for
months
without
breaking
down
somehow
from
thomsom
it
has
a
timekeeper
clock
and
bytes
of
nvram
which
has
a
lithium
battery
backup
the
battery
has
a
life
of
years
of
poweroff
operation
installed
in
a
car
it
could
be
left
powered
on
continuously
and
not
draw
much
current
the
battery
would
only
be
used
when
your
auto
battery
was
dead
or
had
been
removed
side
question
how
about
the
legal
ramifications
of
selling
a
used
car
with
a
replaced
odometer
that
starts
over
at
miles
after
say
actual
miles
looks
like
fraud
would
be
fairly
easy
for
the
price
of
a
new
odometer
you
can
say
it
has
however
many
miles
you
want
to
tell
the
buyer
it
has
in
california
they
have
a
line
on
the
transfer
of
ownership
form
which
states
that
the
odometer
mileage
is
correct
if
incorrect
you
are
required
to
fill
in
what
you
know
or
guesstimate
to
be
the
correct
mileage
if
you
lie
on
this
form
and
are
caught
you
can
be
prosecuted
and
the
buyer
can
sue
you
for
the

i

i
have

forget

aftermarket

on

am
quite
unhappy
with

the

doesnt
put
out

i
will
never
have
an
aftermarket
ac
installed
in
any

my

again
i
just
cant
trust
the
quality
and
performance
after
this
experience
les
let
me
add
my
in
i
had
a
ac
installed
by
the
ford
garage
and
it
did
not
work
as
well
as
the
ac
that
was
installed
by
the
factory
in
pickups
identical
to
mine
i
have
talked
to
other
people
that
have
had
the
same
result
dont
know
if
this
is
just
a
probable
with
ford
or
what
ernie
smith
i
agree
never
have
the
dealer
add
anything
to
your
car
if
you
want
ac
make
sure
it
is
factory
installedhondas
maybe
excluded
many
cant
be
bought
with
ac
installed
at
the
factory
but
i
think
maybe
they
actually
use
all
the
needed
parts
for
a
true
factory
install
when
they
put
one
inas
in
bigger
radiator
etcor
are
designed
properly
for
this
in
the
place
anyway
my
point
is
the
dealer
installed
ac
wont
be
anywhere
near
as
good
as
factory
and
the
service
bums
will
mess
up
your
car
when
installing
it

not

this

would
it
not

through
buick
dealers
in
the
mid
as
the
price
leader
sounds
a
lot
more
like
an

to
me
id
guess
that
this
is
on
the
same
chassis
as
the
kadett
rather
than
the
bigger
manta
but
i
could
easily
be
wrong
i
think
the
later

were
sold
here
as

i
think
the

is
the

name
for

im
pretty
sure
well
the
european
manta
and
us
gt
have
entirely
different

there
is
little
or
no
chance
that
they
are
the

the
manta
went
through
several
generations
as
the
coupe
version
of
the
ascona
and
was
ok
in
its
time
that
the
only
kadetts
sold
here
wereare
the
pontiac
lemans
i
think
the
not
true
the
kadett
has
been
in

out
of
the

market
over
the

the

old

about
to

a

some
of
it
since
i
paid
cash
for
the
last
car
i
bought
i
did
not
have
to
worry
about
whether
or
not
i
had
a
good
amount
of
insurance
on
it
because
of
a
bank
loan
i
just
put
the
amount
that
i
wanted
not
what
a
bank
would
have
wanted
friends
are
telling
me
that
banks
require
some
kind
of
insurance
on
the
car
to
protect
it
since
it
is
collateral
on
loans
is
this
true
can
that
insurance
be
gotten
as
part
of
my
other
insurance
i
assume
i
dont
have
to
pay
a

over
my

insurance
am
i
correct
i
hear
about
accidenthealth

insurance
at

i
am
pretty

these
are

makers
for

i

not

it

really
hate

but
try
reading

posts
then
you
shouldntve
done
it
try
answering
the
damn
question
i
am
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mention
of
the
sc
in
there
never
was
a
tbird
mentioned
the
discussion
was
about
shos
and
stangs
not
being
up
to
spec
i
do
not
know
about
tbirds
i
only
know
that
the
specs
quoted
for
the
sho
by

sounded
a
little
anemic
for
me
to
say
that
it
was
up
to
snuff
this
does
not
kn
any
way
disencourage
me
from
wishing
to
own
one
nor
does
it
make
it
a
bad
car
it
merely
means
that
i
think
ford
could
have
added
that
extra
bit
of
safety
and
tossed
in
larger
brakes
as
the
wheels
are
plenty
large
enough
for
them
to
fit
if
memory
serves
right
which
it
may
very
well
not
and
the
motor
plenty
powerful
enough
to
need
it
well
my
point
was
that
the
sc
and
the
sho
both
have
very
similar
characteristics
front

rear
disks
abs
on
the

harness

if
one

the

isnt

does
anyone
know
why
autos
are
so
popular
in
the
us
while
here
in
europe
they
are
rare
just
wondering
in
many
of
our
cities
there
are
traffic
signals
every
feet
unsynchronised
of
course
well
here
in
ottawa
anyway
and
the
roads
are
so
congested
that
shifting
manually
is
a
real
pain
in
the
left
foot
also
most
canadians
are
too
stupid
to
learn
how
to
shift
manually
gee
i
gotta
coordinate
my
two
feet
on
the
clutch
brake
and
accelerator
and
i
gotta
steer
shift
and
operate
the
signals
optional
and
radio
with
my
two
hands
duh
it
i
agree
wholeheartedly
cant
be
done
also
most
north
american
made
cars
come
with
the
automatic
as
standard
equipment
so
why
bother
with
a
manual
when
the
car
can
shift
for
you
for
no
addition
money
not
sure
about
there
in
ca
but
here
in
us
the
manuals
are
quite
often
the
standard
equipment
of
course
finding
a
car
with
one
might
be
hard
but
if
you
read
the
sticker
on
the
window
there
is
usally
an
additional
or
so
tacked
on
for
that
lousy
tranny
so
you
actually
are
paying
more
just
that
its
sometimes
hard
to
find
one
that
is

president

signed
the

today
which
calls
for

of

in
numbers
over
the
next
three

at

percent
higher
than

oleary
said
as

gary

has
helped
make
texas
a
national
leader
in
converting
the
state
fleet
to
alternative

and
has
been
a
tireless
proponent
of
natural
gas
vehicles
in
speeches
across
the
country
the
task
force
is
to
issue
a
report
within
days
recommending
a
plan
and
schedule
of
implementation
the
department
of
energy
and
all
of
us
in
government
must
lead
by
example
if
the
option
of
alternative

is
going
to
become
a
practical
affordable
choice
for
fleet
owners
across
the
country
oleary
said
increased
use
of
domesticallyproduced
alternative

means
reducing

while
creating

we
believe
that
energy
efficiency
protecting
the
environment
and
a

are
complimentary

the

years

in

i
used
to
do
oil
changes
in
boats
powered
by
automotive
engines
in
many
cases
there
was
no
way
to
get
any
sort
of
a
tray
under
the
oil
pan
because
it
was
boxed
in
by
the
bottom
of
the
hull
and
various
floation
chambers
on
each
side
and
if
you
did
get
something
there
youd
spill
all
the
oil
out
of
it
for
sure
trying
to
get
it
back
out
again
so
we
used
a
small
pump
powered
by
an
electric
drill
to
suck
the
oil
out
the
dipstick
hole
there
was
a

on

fit
down

again
the

wagon

quicker
than
the

automatic
but
significantly
slower
than
the
real
sho
why
anyone
would
order
an

with
an

is
beyond
me
if
you
cant
handle
a

you
should
stick
with
a
regular
taurus
and
leave
the
sho
to
real
drivers
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
arent
real
drivers
who
cant
use
the
stick
eg
disabled
persons
but
they
arent
in
any
position
to
use
an
sho
anyway
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
if
we
removed
the
automatic
transmissions
from
all
performancetype
cars
like
the
mustangs
camaros

the

from

by
markmbigfootspsmotcom
mark
monninger
this
kind
of
behavior
is
what
i
was
shocked
by
in
my
experience
for
crying
out
loud
how
do
these
turkeys
think
they
can
talk
to
customers
this
way
and
still
stay
in
business
again
i
dont
expect
sales
people
to
bow
scrape
and
grovel
in
my
presence
but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
abused
either
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
way
the
sales
people
talked
to
me
and
in
other
negotiating
sessions
i
overheard
in
neighboring
sales
cubicles
evidently
their
success
rate
is
high
enough
that
they
continue
to
do
business
this
way
there
must
be
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
are
easy
to
intimidate
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
went
to
a
dealership
to
test
drive
a
car
afterwards
we
sat
down
to
discuss
prices
i
explained
that
i
wanted
a
car
just
like
the
one
i
drove
but
in
a
different
color
he
said
he
could
get
one
exactly
like
i
wanted
from
the
dealer
network
within
a
day
we
then
negotiated
a
price
and
signed
the
deal
next
day
i
get
a
call
he
explains
that
they
goofed
and
they
had
neglected
to
take
into
account
a
price
increase
the
last
price
increase
had
occurred
over
months
prior
to
my
visit
if
i
still
wanted
the
car
i
would
have
to
fork
over
another
as
an
alternative
they
would
honor
the
price
if
i
bought
the
car
i
test
drove
which
had
been
sitting
around
for
months
and
had
a
few
miles
on
it
i
said
goodbye
this
was
a
good
example
of
how
they
can
lowball
you
and
still
cover
their
butts
its
too
bad
more
people
dont
demand
honesty
or
these
types
of
dealers
would
no
longer
be
in
business
the
next
dealership
i
went
to
was
straightforward
and
honest
first
thing
the
salesman
said
was
letss
see
what
you
have
for
dealer
cost
and
work
out
how
much
profit
i
should
make
the
deal
went
through
with
no

should

i

without
using
either

doing

aint
a
rush
for
me
but
its
fun
and
i
get
where
i
want
to
go
much
faster
in
defense
of
the
drivers
who
are
in
the
right
lane
here
in
the
states
people
simply
do
not
expect
when
they
are
driving
to
be
overtaken
at
a
speed
differential
of
i
dont
think
this
is
because
they
are
stupid
of
course
there
are
exceptions
they
are
just
programmed
because
of
the
limit
do
you
in

states
when
you
look
in

rearview
always
calculate
future
positions
of
cars

speed
differential
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
drive
in
the
left
lane
fast
but
when
i
overtake
cars
who
are
on
the
right
i
slow
down
a
tad
bit
if
i
were
to
rely
on
the
judgement
of
the
other
car
to
recognize
the
speed
differential
i
would
be
the
stupid
one
just
to
satiate
my
curiosity
why
would
this
make
you
the
stupid
one
it
seems
to
me
everybody
should
be
aware
enough
of
what
is
going
on
you
do
not
need
to
calculate
the
future
position
you
need
to
look
at
your
mirrors
a
little
more
if
you
glance
around
you
will
be
able
to
tell
how
much
faster
than
you
the
car
is
going
maybe
not
precisely
but
well
enough
to
know
if
you
should
let
him
around
before
you
try
to
pass
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about
about
the
other
driver
being
startled
because
i
myself
have
been
startled
by
drivers
cruising
by
at
around
when
im
doin
the
problem
though
as
i
saw
it
was
not
their
fault
for
barreling
around
me
but
my
fault
for
not
paying
the
attention
to
my
taskathand
that
i
should
have
been
oddly
enough
since
the
timehappened
in
around
mo
when
id
had
my
liscence
for
around
mo
i
havent
been
startledand
ive
been
passed
by
cars
doing
roughly
twice
the
speed
of
my
car
another
odd
occurance
is
the
fact
that
this
only
seems
to
happen
on
long
tripsand
if
i
drive
along
with
them
it
doesnt
happen
at
all
even
on
the
long

adrenaline
will
do
that

youive
had

cop
experiences

anything
over
the
limit
is
adrenalizing
for

just

a

after

frankly
the
saturn
way
of
doing

service
was
a
very
big
plus
i
hadnt
bought

car
since
i
bought
my
honda
back
in
and
i
was
unbelieveably
offended
by
most
salespeople
i
met
saturn
was
indeed
very
different
i
made
three
different
visits
to
the
dealer
where
i
bought
my
car
and
was
never
pressured
saturn
also
had
the
best
aftersales
support
and
the
fixed
pricing
made
it
very
easy
for
me
to
decide
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
buy
another
big
selling
point
was
running
into
my
mechanic
at
the
dealer
hes
been
fixing
imports
for
yearsand
bought
a
saturn
based
on
what
hes
seen
and
heard
from
his
customers
saturn
also
has
a
good
extended
warranty
program
for
miles
fully
refunded
if
you
dont
use
it
that
works
out
to
an
actual
cost
of
or
so
based
on
the
year
treasury
rates
using
savings
account
rates
its
more
like
in

three
years
it
also
buys
you
free
rental
during
any
warranty
work
without
counting
against
the
refund

brake

joni

my
honda
accord
just
hit
the
magic
mile
mark
and
now
all
sorts
of
things
are
beginning
to
go
bad
the
latest
problem
i
am
experiencing
is
with
my
brakes
they
still
stop
the
car
fine
but
once
i
am
stopped
completely
my
brake
pedal
will
sink
another
or
inches
all
by
itself
if
feels
really
strange
and
i
am
worried
my
brakes
will
quit
working
one
of
these
days
i
checked
my
brake
fluid
and
the
reservoir
was
full
but
the
fluid
itself
looked
really
dirty
like
dirty
oil
i
called
my
mechanic
and
he
told
me
i
need
a
new
brake
master
cylinder
which
will
cost
me
a
whopping
you
are
not
alone
my
honda
accord
with
miles
on
it
started
showing
the
same
behavior
i
replaced
the
brake
master
cylinder
myself
it
took
about
an
hour
and
cost
about
sure
beats
paying
to
have
someone
else
do
it
if
i
wanted
to
rebuild
my
own
master
cylinder
instead
of
putting
in
a
rebuilt
one
it
would
have
cost
only
to
for
the
rebuild
kit
the
honda
brake
master
cylinder
is
easy
to
get
to
two
bolts
attach
it
to
the
engine
compartment
two
brake
lines
enter
the
master
cylinder
the
tricky
part
was
that
the
brake
lines
were
stuck
tight
my
craftsmen
open
end
wrench
rounded
off
the
bolt
heads
i
had
to
use
vise
grips
to
loosen
those
suckers
wow
best
invention
since
sliced
bread
after
that
it
was
very
easy
bolt
the
new
part
in
place
add
new
brake
fluid
and
bleed
the
brakes
this
is
quite
easy
even
for
a
beginner
my
local
auto
parts
store
had
a
repair
manual
for
the
honda
accord
it
had
detailed
diagrams
of
the
master

just

rarely
do
you
shift

when

is
what
speeds
are
good
is
good
up
through

most
of

so
you
can
just
wind

out
its
not
going
to
hurt
anything
and
keeps

anyway
only
shift

get

send

they

contact
the

insurance
company
and
they

it

end
when

leave
you
in

ive
read
in
this
group
that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar
guns
by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
more
than
that
geico
funded
the
company
that
developed
lidar
when
locals
showed
a
reluctance
to
buy
the
units
geico
started
giving
them
away
i
know
theyve
given
units
to
the
florida
highway
patrol
county
sheriffs
a
and
some
local
governments
the
real
question
is
why
this
is
the
hook
geico
and
other
ins
cos
can
tell
which
drivers
represent
risk
this
is
a
determination
they
can
make
after
you
receive
a
speeding
ticket
from
one
of
geicos
lidar
units
most
drivers
do
not
represent
increased
risk
even
after
a
ticket
or
two
but
this
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
raise
rates
for
equal
risk
its
called
extra
profits
they
also
know
how
silly
the
nsl
is
and
how
it
is
almost
universally
ignored
driving
in
excess
of
the
nsl
gets
you
a
ticket
an
increase
in
your
rates
points
on
your
license
but
it
doesnt
make
you
a
riskier
driver
to
insure
like
the
sound
of
this
like
the
people
who
thought
up
the
scheme
go
geico
unless
you
have
some
driving
history
problems
youre
usually
better
to
go
with
one
of
the
major
companies
and
stay
there
youll
get
long

hear
hear
thanks
robbie
you
also
dont
read
that
much
about
violence
against
teenagers
such
as
george
bush
burying
alive
tens
of
thousands
of
unarmed
iraqi
who
were
trying
to
surrender
with
bulldozers
on
the
other
hand
i
think
it
is
true
without
singling
out
teenagers
for
blame
that
violence
is
more
socially
acceptable
than
it
used
to
be
those
of
us
whod
like
to
discourage
violence
have
plenty
of
work
to
do
with
people
of
all
ages
well
this
isnt
the
right
group
for
this
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
dont
think
violence
is
any
more
socially
acceptable
now
by
any
means
how
can
you
say
that
when
we
used
to
have
of
pistoltoting
gunslingers
as
heros
or
even
gangland
thugs
being
considered
romantic
do
you
think
our
great
grandparent
got
yelled
at
by
their
parents
for
playing
cowboys
and
indians
i
dont
think
so
that
behavior
was
somewhat
encouraged
back
then
in
fact
i
think
the
only
difference
between
now
and
then
is
that
nowadays
when
some
teenager
kills
another
one
in
a
classroom
in
california
we

it

anyone

the

this

applies

in

lik

you
are

i
also

the

ends
if
you
actually
accept

if
you
agree

then
when
about

slips
you
a

with
different

and
leads
you
to
believe
that
it

you
verbally

there

re

ive
had
a
valentine
for
about
months
now
and
i
agree

it
is
the
best
det
ector
available
the
point
here
is
trust
and
reliability
ive
been
able
to
tr
ust
the
valentine
more
than
any
other
detector
ive
owend
if
the
valentine
sa
ys
that
there
is
a
moderate
to
strong
radar
source
in
front
of
me
then
its
mo
re
than
likely
to
be
a
speed
trap
with
my
other
detectors
ive
gotten
so
many
falses
that
ive
begun
to
ignore
someo
of
the
warnings
because
i
didnt
want
t
o
drive
like
i
had
one
foot
on
the
brake
and
one
on
the
gas
pedal
that
directional
indicator
really
really
helps
plus
more
info
is
almost
alwa
ys
better
than
less
info
no
matter
how
smart
radar
detectors
get
the
human
br
ain
is
usually
smarter
so
if
im
going
to
make
a
decisio
based
on
information
at
hand
i
want
all
the
info
i
can
get
plus
if
you
divide
the
overall
streng
th
of
the
radar
signal
by
the
number
of
bogeys
reported
youll
find
that
each
bogey
is
pretty
weak
and
therefore
not
a
radar
threat
with
other
detectors
yo
ull
just
get

strong
warning
my
logic
may

this

well
it

on
what

you
have
my
previous
car
had
locking
lugnuts
that
weighed
about
more
than
the
others
the

were
factory
equipment
and
according
to
the
factory
service
manual
after
tire
balancing
the
technicianmechanic
was
supposed
to
put
a
oz
counterweight
on
the
rim
opposite
the
locking
nut
i
always
had
vibration
problems
with
those
stupid
lugnuts
since
no
one
ever
did
the
service
correctly
i
eventually
got
rid
of
the
locking
lugnuts
and
replaced
them
with
the
standard
lugnuts
unfortunately
i
found
out
about
the
counterweighting
technique
months
after
i
got

the

my

a

are

for

they
have
been
made
to
be
exactly
the

weight
as
the
nonlocking
lugnuts
said
so
on
the
package
and
i
verified
it
myself
i
havent
had
any
vibration
problems
with
the
tires
at
all
due

the

in
of
ownership
i
did
have

they

considered
so

are
just

at

nothing
beats
the

for
efficiency

emissions
torque

its
also
cheaper
diesels
fall
into
the
same

mythology
as
alcohol
fuels
the
main
reason
they
are

cleaner
is
because
they
are
better

the
emissions
we
actually
measure
and
regulate
but
they
also
contribute
additional
emissions
which
have
long
been
determined
to
be
as
harmful
but
no
suitable
control
or
limits
have
been
defined
current
evidence
is
pointing
to
most
visible
smog
actually
being
diesel

suspended

and
less

diesel

now
becoming
a
major
concern
in

emit
signifcantly
more

the

we
may
have

ignoring
the

subject
re

art
of
clutchless
shifting
im
not
familiar
with
the
trannies
used
in
winston
cup
but
in
the
transam
cars
ive
played
with
the
transmissions
were
the
racing
variety
with
dog
clutches
instead
of
sychros
in
a
transmission
with
dog
clutches
the
gears
are
always
engaged
with
each
other
and
moving
the
dog
clutches
engages
the
gears
to
the
shafts
motorcycle
transmissions
are
the
same
way
shifting
without
the
clutch
on
a
transmission
with
syncros
can
and
will
cause
transmission
damage
the
only
question
being
how
long
it
takesto
grenade
something
for
the
trans
in
my
pulsar
se
it
was
about
miles
but
it
had
a
weak
tranny
in
the
first
place
just
out
of
curiosity
how
is
this
dog
clutch
any
different
from
a
synchro
transmission
what
you
described
sounds
the
same
to
me
in
fact
what
little
ive
studied
on
trannies
the
instructor
referred
to
the
synchros
as
dogs
and
said
they
were
synonymous
the
gears
are
always
meshed
in
a
synchronized
gearbox
and
you
slip
the
synchro
gears
back
and
forth
by
shifting
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
was
taught
explain
por
favour
motorcycle
transmissions
dont
have
synchros
the
engagment
dogs
are
very
corse
and
sloppy
there
are
maybe
teeth
dogs
on
the
side
of
the
gears
that
engage
the
next
gear
over
as
the
forks
slide
the
gears
back
and
forth
to
shift
start
to
apply
pressure
at
the
same
time
the
clutch
is
pulled
the
clutch
is
a
hand
lever
and
shift
quickly
if
you
try
a
slow
lazy
shift
it
will
grind
you
just
have
to
pop
it
into
the
next
gear
before
it
has
a
chance
to
grind
there
isnt
a
neutral
between
gears
obviously
there
is
but
you
cant
select
it
with
the
shifter
so
double
clutching
is
not
a
possibility
speed
shifting
which
is
what
i
have
always
heard
clutchless
shifting
called
works
pretty
well
for
upshifts
with
some
practice
but
i
usually
use
the
clutchespecially
for
the
lower
gears
i
think
auto
as
in
automobile
trannys
are
similar
except
that
the
engagment
dogs
are
very
fine
with
no
slop
and
the
addition
of
syncho
rings
the
gear
teeth
are
always
engaged
in
auto
transmissions
that
are
synchronized
but
may
not
be
in
nonsynchro

you

our

got
yelled
at
by
their

for
playing
cowboys
and
indians
i
dont
think
so
that
behavior
was
somewhat
encouraged
back
then
in
fact
i
think
the
only
difference
between
now
and
then
is
that
nowadays
when
some
teenager
kills
another
one
in
a
classroom
in
california
we
here
about
it
in
ma
the
same
day
back
in
the
old
days
theyd
never
hear
about
something
like
that
period
yeah
people
act
really
shocked
about
violence
as
though
it
were
new
to
our
species
what
about
the
holocaust
the
crusades
the
salem
witch
trials
the
religious
persecutions
of
the
middleages
what
about
violent
acts
carried
out
in
the
name
of
religion
all
over
the
world
what
about
the
early
christians
put
to
death
by
the
romans
the
jews
persecuted
by
christians
there
are
a
lot
more
humans
today
than
there
have
ever
been
i
do
not
know
the
stats
but
there
are
far
more
people
on
the
planet
than
there
were
or
hundred
years
ago
the
per
capita
acts
of
violence
are
probably
not
significantly
different
than
they
were
a
hundred
or
a
thousand

there
is

i

next

the

gave
me
some
pamphlets
about
the

and
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
being
a

new

buyer
i
am
seeking
advice
from
veterans
esp
those
who
have
bought
saturns
lately
fyi
i
have
listed
some
of
the

of
the

plan
the

i
say
extended
warranties
are
a

highprofit
item
for
dealers
but
what
i
really
want
to
point
out
here
is
that
you
are
not
buying
you
get
free
so
what
you
are
buying
is
keep
that
in
mind
when
you
look
at
the
cost
vs
coverage
another
point
is
that
many
car
companies
routinely
fix

jonathan

based
on
my
experience
with
a
the
hardtop
jeepstyle
model
i
would
definitely
give
a
new
model
consideration
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
models
are
very
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
its
mind
i
would
assume
until
proven
otherwise
that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages

its

which
you

a
conclusion
i
disagree
with
since
the

incorporates
multiple

its
not

that
its
significantly
more
expensive
while
the

may

there
is

call

im
another

might

coming
at

high
a

a

i
was
able

confirm
that
this

in

the
case
at
first
there
was
some
problem
with
the
performance
axle

she
wouldnt
go
into
any
details
so
i
dont
know
if
there
were
some
shipped
that
had
problems
or
if
production
was
held
up
because
they
simply
didnt
have
the
proper

from
the

i

she
was
pretty

if

respond
supposedly
this

is

solved
second
there
is
a

that
is
somehow
related

so
as
of
this
posting
there
is
a
production
hold
on

she
claimed
part
of
the
delay
was
not
wanting
to
use
inferior
quality
parts
for
the

and
therefore
having
to
wait
for

it
and
about
a
year

at

shift
handle
got
stuck
while
attempting
to
put
it
in
reverse
the
shifter
would
not

the
clutch
had
no
effect
the
front
tires
would
not
budge
even
when
the
clutch
is
fully
depressed
if
the
clutch
is
released
the
engine
would
die
assuming
that
some
gear
was
engaged
while
the
shifter
was
stuck
i
could
not
make
the
car
move
it
acted
as
if
it
were
in

for
dying
when
clutch
is

i
finally
was
able
to
release
the
shifter
by
having
someone
rock
the
car
back
and
forth
less
than
an
inch
while
i
depressed
the
clutch
and
jiggled
the
shifter
the
shifter
acted
normally
after
that
when
this
happened
i
took
it

they

it
was

they
checked

it

i
had
the
exact
problem
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
again
last
week
the
dealer
says
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
because
mitsubishi
the
says
they
have
never
heard
of
the
problem
and
the
dealer
could
not
reproduce
the
problem
while
they
had
the
car
in
all
three
occurances
the
car
was
parked
head
first
in
a
garage
and
since
the
front
wheels
were
stuck
the
car
could
not
be
towed
to
the
dealer
before
releasing
the
shifter
hence
temporarily
solving
the
problem
and
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
refused
to
send
someone
to
check
the
car
while
it
was
stuck
i
know
there
is
smething
wrong
with
the
transmission
shifting
from
to
and
getting
stuck
at
random
but
i
cant
get
the

fix
it
i

but
why
not
turn
the
question
around
why
are
automatics
so
common
in
the
us
because
some
people
like
them
and
some
people
actually
need
them
my
guess
is
that
when
they
tried
to
couple
manuals
to
the
torquerich
in
the
sixties
the
clutches
turned
out
as
real
killers
you
had
to
use
both
feet
to
depress
and
that
this
has
just
lived
on
yeah
right
real
muscle
cars
had
a
manual
transmission
and
their
clutches
arent
that
heavy
shelbyamerican
used
plenty
of
highpowered
hightorque
engines
and
carroll
only
put
autos
in
his
cars
because
people
wanted
them
blasphemers
heretics
burn
them
burn
them
for
defiling
a
shelby
with
an
auto
real
cobras
and
they
were
the
ultimate
sports
car
at
the
time
had
bigblock
fords
which
turned
out
prodigious
amounts
of
power
and
torque
and
none
of
them
had
automatics
and
also
an
automatic
with
a
engine
can
be
real
fun
to
drive
yeah
if
you
call
a

in

i
personally
would
love
to
have

yes
this

the

unfortunately
ford
has
this
with

does

to

the

where
are

located

there
is
no

holes
that
i

it
regretably
i
waited
three
months
as
i
was
short
cash
and
they
wouldnt

it

it
messed

they
firts
replaced
the

gasket
which
i

they
did

gear
and
final
drive
ratios
contrary
to
popular
misperception
a
number
of
japanese
cars
have
quite
good
performance
from
in
top
gear
no
problem
with
that
the
question
is
do
they
perform
consistently
in
all
conditions
roads
winds
and
curves
at
that
speed
and
do
so
for
hours
on
end
year
after
year
without
giving
the
driver
white
knuckles
from
my
experience
on
the
autobahnsautostrade
a
good
touring
car
can
be
easily
distinguished
by
its
poise
at
the
best
stay
on
cruise
control
at
for
hours
ive
seen
the
typical
boy
racer
in
a
fiat
try
to
keep
up
sure
they
hit
the
century
mark
but
if
the
wind
blows
the
wrong
way
they
change
lanes
and
if
on
an
overpass
they
may
fly
right
into
a
guardrail
the
buffeting
at
can
be
severe
enough
to
make
the
hood
bend
tires
at
can
melt
and
a
pothole
can
kill
many
german
cars
are
designed
for
this
environment
even
if
they
cant
seem
to
get
out
of
their
own
way
from
a
stop
light
mercedes
come
to
mind
in
particular
and
another
design
point
is
fuel
economy
at
those
speeds
the
germans
gear
the
car
for
very
good
high
speed
efficiency
a
typical
mb
turns
at
almost
a
stall
good
point
i
have
no
idea
how
either
of
my
hondas
will
handle
at
mph
nor
do
they
reach
however
using
high
to
be
mph
a
they
are
quite
amenable
to
long
high
speed
drives
ive
done
several
mile
trips
in
my
civic
with
no
problems
whatsoever
the
last
big
trip
i
made
was
driving
from
new
york
to
texas
i
remember
driving
miles
a
day
at
typically
mph
without
any
problems
im
sure
i
would
have
been
more
comfortable
driving
a
benz
but
no
white
knuckles
no
problems
with
winds
and
curves
then
there
was
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
after
mardi
gras
where
we
were
doing
all
the
way
to
houston
no
problems
b
both
my
cars
have
surprising
good
fuel
economy
at
high
speeds
i
see
no
difference
between
sustained
mph
and
sustained
on
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
we
got
about
mpg
in
my
integra
quite
ok
mind
you
the
engine
revs
to
almost
at
the
civic
is
markedly
better
than
the
integra
in
fuel
economy
miles
down
the
road
i
still
get
mpg
at
mph
driving
b
i
cant
understand
why
these
highscale
european
marquees
are
afraid
to
design
engines
that
can
be
repeatedly
revved
to
near
redline
in
the
low
gears
i
have
been
doing
that
for
that
last
miles
with
my
lowly
civic
with
no
detriment
to
either
the
engine
or
the
clutch
and
getting
excellent
mpg
to
boot
id
call
this
an
engineering
hack
to
cover
up
design
deficiencies
at
miles
youd
still
be
breakingin
a
highscale
european
marquee
they
typically
are
designed
to
last
miles
per
engine
mi
per
chassis
the
record
is
now
over
miles
on
a
benz
diesel
and
ive
read
about
transmissions
lasting
miles
speaking
of
now
now
you
cant
compare
a
diesel
with
a
gasoline
engine
i
see
enough
bmws
and
gasoline
mercs
for
sale
that
have
miles
on
them
and
advertise
rebuilt
engines
if
honda
was
to
build
an
accord
for
id
darn
well
expect
the
sucker
to
last
miles
diesels
they
have
very
good
efficiency
at
the
cost
of
acceleration
and
are
very
popular
in
all
european
cars
diesel
is
considered
the
green
fuel
from
the
smallest
econoboxes
to
the
luxobarges
again
we
see
a
difference
in
mentality
diesels
in
the
us
are
considered
slightly
worse
than
useless
and
extremely
dirty
to
boot
so
you
cant
give
them
away
ever
got
caught
behind
a
early
at
a
stop
light
its
not
pleasant
the
newer
mbs
are
a
lot
better
though
the
diesel
volvos
and
vws
are
probably
the
smelliest
offenders
as
for
economy
why
should
we
care
gas
is
cheap
i
personally
wouldnt
buy
a
diesel
car
for
any
reason

was

sue
me
for
doing

i

the

rolls
down

i
still
can
hardly
consider
this

to
be

we
go
no
of

porsche
doesnt
have
a
patent
on
the
targa
name
if
that
were
the
case
what
would
fiat
do
i
suppose
that
technically
my
del
sol
is
not
a
convertible
in
the
literal
sense
but
it
certainly
classifies
as
an
open
topped
car
in
addition
the
rear
section
behind
the
removable
top
is
what
makes
my

about
a
company
in

pulled

has
adapted
it
to
the

floorpan
as

all
i
can
remember
about
the
vw
thing
i
used
to
own
is
that
it
had
about
more
suspension
travel
than
a
stock
beetle
but
id
heard
that
there
were
after
market
parts
for

use
that
were
as
good
or
better
note
that
the
major
difference
looks
wise
between
a
kubel
a
thing
are
the
hood
and
the
fenders
the
kubel
had
an
external
spare
mounted
on
the
hood
and
the
hood
sloped
down
for
visibility
sharply
and
had
rounded
fenders
the
thing
has
a
lightly
sloped
hood
with
the
spare
mounted
inside

moved

in

and
the
instrument
pannel
of
the
car
has
been
replaced
and
the
odometer
also
has
been
reset
to
zero
therefore
the
true
meter
reading
is
the
reading
before
replacement
plus
current
mileage
that
shows
mile
difference
comparing
to
the
mileage
on
the
odometer
disclosure
from
the
dealer
never
told
me
anything
about
that
important
story
i
hope
that
i
can
return
the
car
with
full
refund
do
u
think
this
is
possible
does
anyone
have
similar
experiences
any
comments
will
be
appreciated
thanks
this
is
a
tricky
situation
if
the
previous
owner
didnt
inform
the
dealer
of
the
odometer
change
then
the
previous
owner
committed
fraud
and
he
may
be
liable
the
dealer
may
also
be
liable
if
the
previous
owner
notified
the
dealer
or
if
the
previous
owner
had
the
dash
replaced
at
a
dealer
or
if
the
previous
owner
had
the
dash
changed
legally
any
records
search
on
the
car
should
turn
up
the
fact
that
the
odometer
had
been
altered
if
a
dealer
changes
the
speedometer
he
has
to
report
it
it
goes
into
the
cars
service
record
with
the
manufacturer
and
on
the
title
if
i
remember
correctly
the
dealer
told
me
that
the
old
mileage
etc
were
sent
to
ford
when
my
tbirds
speedo
was
replaced
if
the
odometer
can
be
set
to
the
old
mileage
it
must
be
if
it
cant
eg
electricallydriven
odometers
then
the
mileage
of
the
old
odometer
must
be
written
on
a
permanent
sticker
which
is
affixed
to
the
door
frame
of
the
vehicle
either
way
if

very

it

no

is

what
can

do
to
fix
this

this
has
been
a
problem
from
time
to
time
but
has
straightened
itself
out
until
now
i
dont
have
a
tach
but
by
gauging
by
the
sound
of
the
engine
it
is
idling
about
twice
as
fast
as
it
should
be
this
is
down

what
it
was
idling
at

i
pulled
up
at

sometimes
a
bad
choke
pulloff
diaphram
will
cause
a

to
fast

the
pulloff
which
is
vacuum
actuated
provides
a
necessary
pull
in
noncold
weather
conditions
to
get
the
idle
off
the
the
fast
idle
cam
locate
the
fast
idle
cam
on
your
vehicle
and
see
if
you
can
rotate
it
to
produce
a
normal
idle
if
so
locate
the
diaphram
and
test
it
if
you
cant
apply
suction
via
a
good
piece
of
rubber
vacuum
hose
with
your

that
will
cause

looked

there

i
took

about
months
later
this

i
happened
to
look
in
the
spare

well
and
noticed
water
standing
in
there
the

was
more
reluctant
this
time
to
replace

i
convinced

to

it
they
must

had

did
well
in
the
test
than
a
car
that
did
horribly
you
raise
a
valid
point
but
again
its
a
tradeoff
how
much
money
do
you
want
to
spend
for
that
kind
of
protection
you
could
buy
a
volvo
saab
or
benz
and
get
really
good
crash
protection
and
other
luxuries
but
youll
pay
significantly
more
for
it
in
my
case
its
out
of
the
question
because
all
of
those
cars
are
beyond
my
budget
ive
been
in
two
major
auto
accidents
both
were
multiple
car
the
worst
was
a
headon
three
car
collision
t
intersection
and
one
person
ran
a
stop
sign
in
both
cases
i
was
stopped
and
had
no
place
to
go
and
i
saw
it
coming
both
times
even
in
highspeed
headon
collisions
the
most
beneficial
item
you
can
have
is
a
good
old
seatbelt
nowadays
at
least
in
the
us
you
get
an
airbag
if
you
get
a
belt
so
presumably
you
get
an
added
safety
benefit
there
as
well
thats
something
i
certainly
look
for
and
which
can
be
had
in
inexpensive
cars
if
you
really
want
to
add
safety
to
any
car
simply
add
a
cage
to
the
car
they
are
available
and
cheap
about
in
the
usa
add
to
that
four
or
five
or
six
point
belts
and
you
will
walk
away
from
collisions
that
were
otherwise
not
survivable
but
instead
of
people
spending
a
little
extra
money
we
get
legislation
that
says
the
govt
must
mandate
a
minimal
level
of
protection
for
everyone
one
other
significant
factor
in
improving
ones
own
safety
is
to
get
some
training
this
will
improve
your
safety
more
than
any
other
single
investment
will
driveride
defensively
and
that
does
not
mean
you
have
to
be
a
doddering
old
stick
in
the
mud
people
here
tend
to
enthuse
about
autos
more
than
the
average
probably
in
the
top
percentile
in
driving
ability
but
still
we
sometimes
overlook
the
obvious
ive
been
to
two
driving
schools
and
three
riding
schools
for
my
motorcycle
a
very
worthwhile
investment
and
besides
it
was
a
lot
of
fun
too
safety
is
what
you
make
of
it
just
because
a
carmaker
doesnt
provide
you
with
an
adequate
level
of
protection
doesnt

you

much
an
edgecase
you
cant
assume
that
everywhere
has
roads
in
such
good
condition
such
flat
terrain
and
such
wideopen
spaces
it
just
aint
so
well
lets
see
in
just
my
own
personal
experience
theres
nevada
new
mexico
texas
wyoming
utah
south
dakota
nebraska
minnesota
montana
florida
and
parts
of
louisianna
nobody
said
lets
go
into
town
and
drive
on
main
st
and
you
couldnt
go
that
fast
on
the
graveled
washboard
that
passes
for
highway
in
some
parts
but
that
only
really
expensive
cars
should
be
driven
fast
crap
is
well
crap
wr
subject
re
its
a
rush
was
re
too
fast
remember
roads
in
america
are
not
designed
for
speeds
above
meaning
they
would
be
safe
at
roads
like
the
autobahn
are
smoother
straiter
wider
and
slightly
banked
example
a
few
months
back
i
was
traveling
late
at
night
am
or
so
and
i
was
changing
highways
at
a
bent
crosssing
it
curved
off
to
the
south
east
becoming
hidden
by
trees
after
about
ft
and
continued
to
the
left
strait
north
i
wanted
to
turn
north
checked
the
south
lane
rolled
into
the
crossing
and
checked
the
north
lane
nevertheless
there
wasnt
a
car
in
sight
so
i
took
one
last
look
and
pulled
into
the
left
hand
lane
now
my
car
isnt
a
sec
performer
but
i
was
in
the
corect
lane
and
over
in
decent
time
even
at
i
wasnt
wasting
time
it
was
then
that
i
checked
my
mirror
and
saw
a
mustang
closing
in
my
lane
fast
he
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
was
just
noticing
me
luckly
he
saw
me
and
changed
lanes
in
time
i
estamate
he
was
moving
in
excess
of
or
so
i
was
just
a
by
stander
i
had
no
chance
of
runing
from
him
or
moving
out
of
his
way
im
glad
he
saw
my
brake
lights
in
time
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
would
have
happened
had
i
wainted
to
pull
out
and
not
left
the
time
he
needed
to
dodge
me
rule
just
because
your
car
can
do
and
your
way
is
clear
dont
assume
it
will
stay
that
way
travis
disclamer
the
ideas

in

the

hello
i
have
a
toyota
and
in
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
been
getting
quite
a
few
dings
in
the
paint
on
the
hood
from
rocks
and
debris
off
of
the
road
i
have
never
had
any
major
problems
with
other
cartrucks
in
the
past
maybe
a
ding
once
in
a
while
i
went
to
the
dealer
and
he
said
that
it
happens
all
of
the
time
and
he
recomended
putting
a
bug
deflector
on
the
hood
he
said
that
the
trucks
for
some
unknown
reason
seem
to
have
this
problem
more
than
some
cars
it
seems
to
me
that
either
my
luck
is
really
bad
or
there
might
be
a
problem
with
the
paint
painted
on
a
monday
morning
perhaps
how
well
do
these
bug
deflectors
work
for
small
road
debris
on

if
anyone
has
any
experiencessuggestions
please
let

rfiart
of
clutchless
shifting
im
wondering
if
anybody
else
out
there
is
a
clutchless
shifter
ive
been
doing
it
my
self
over
miles
on
my
current
toyota
truck
ive
got
over
ive
heard
people
talk
about
how
doing
this
can
damage
a
transmission
my
experiences
suggest
otherwise
what
techniques
do
you
use
on
some
old
pieces
of
junk
i
drove
the
transmission
was
so
worn
that
pumping
the
clutch
was
the
only
way
to
shift
except
clutchless
to
date
ive
driven
rabbits
datsuns
comets
fords
a
chevy
some
where
harder
than
others
to
shift
but
generally
the
higher
the
milage
the
smoother
quicker
easier
they
where
to
shift
my
technique
is
to
ease
back
off
the
throttle
and
at
the
same
time
gently
wrist
back
on
the
shift
lever
if
for
some
reason
i
miss
the
shift
window
i
lightly
press
the
accelerator
try
agian
ive
found
that
clutchless
shifting
is

mustang
its
supposed

looking
similar
to
the

concept
car
ford
came
out
with
around
january
i
cant
wait
anyone
out
there
hear
anything
about
it
recently
if
everything
ive
read
is
correct
ford
is
doing
nothing
but
re
skinning
the
existing
mustang
with
minor
suspension
modifications
and
the
pictures
ive
seen
indicate
they
didnt
do
a
very
good
job
of
it
the
new
mustang
is
nothing
but
a
recycle
of
a
year
old
car
gee
is
it
already
yes
it
will
still
be
on
the
fox
program
chasis
anything
that
will
be
differe
nt
on
the
new
car
as
far
as
mechanicals
is
unknown
the
suspension
will
most
likely
be
changed
as
well
as
the
drive
drain
from
what
has
been
printed
on
it
there
is
no
clear
idea
of
what
will
be
done
as
some
say
it
will
have
the
modular
and
others
the
current
small
block
just
have
to
wait
and
see
also
is
far
as
styling
goes
from
what
i
seen
is
good
a
return
to
tradition
c
scoop
on
the
sides
and
roof
line
much
like
a
or
fastback
you
know
im
a
ford
fan
i
must
say
so
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
mustang
i
have
faith
that
it
will
be
a
fine
product
more
desireable
than
the
camaro
is
now
you
know
thats
mho
the
differences
these
days
between
ford
and
gm
are
not
so
much
the
quality
just
the
philosophy
it
used
to
be
quality
and
philosophy
gm
is
barely
catching
up
but
they
have
more
room
for
improvement
that
can
only
be
made
up
in
time
stss
still
come
off
the
assembly
line
with
screwed
up
paint
stripes
and
poor
trunkdoorhoodpanel
alignments
its
those
year
old
plants
and
the
latest
gm
products
still
come
with
the
standard
equipment
rattledash
tm
but
like
i
said
theyre
getting
better
and
making
the
move
in
the
right
direction
they
beat
ford
to
the
market
with
the
camarofirebird
but
really
only
in
words
production
of
these
vehicles
will
be
limited
until
the
end
of
the
year
keeping
selling
prices
above
msrp
for
the
most
part
since
there
are
so
many
twitching
camaro
fans
out
there
i
wouldnt
press
ford
to
hurry
the
mustang
since
the
final
wait
could
be
worth
it
besides
no
bowtie
fanatic
is
gonna
buy
the
mustang
anyway
i
do
not
put
much
stock
in
the
mag
rags
inside
information
or
even
ford
rep
quotes
the
taurus
was
pretty
much
a
surprise
when
it
was
finally
disclosed
in
its
entirety
inside
information
had
the
taurus
with
a
and
rearwheel
drive
at
one
point
i
wouldnt
look
for
a
simple
repaneled
mustang
folks
you
may
be
cheating
yourself
if
you
do
theres
a
lot
of
potential
ford
hasnt
released
a
new
car
without
a
is
in
years
the
mustang
project
has
been
brewing
for
at
least
right
a
is
could
happen
those
modular
are
out
there
too
in
the
interest
of
cafe
and
competition
dont
rule
those
out
either
your
ignorant
if
you
do
and
there
are
so
many
spy
shots
and
artist
renderings
out
there
who
really
knows
what
itll
look
like
the
mach
iii
doubt
it
highly
the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
i
submit
that
the
mustang
will
be
a
success
enough
to
elicit
defensive
remarks
from
some
heavy
camaro
fans
here
you
know
intelligent
critical
spews
like
the
mustang
bites
man
some
of
you
are
already
beginning
i
predict
that
the
mustang
and
camaro
will
be
comparable
performers
as
usual
i
predict
that
the
differences
will
be
in
subjective
areas
like
looks
and
feel
as
usual
the
camaro
is
still
a
huge
automobile
the
mustang
will
retain
its
cabrearward
styling
and
short
ponycar
wheelbase
the
camaro
still
reaches
out
to
the
fighter
pilot
while
the
mustang
will
appeal
to
the
driver
the
camaro
will
still
sell
to
the
muscle
car
set
while
the
mustang
will
continue
to
sell
to
the
collegedegreed
muscle
car
set
both
will
be
more
refined
i
do
think
the
camaro
is
there
will
be
no
clear
winner
unless
the
ford
gets
the
romeo
you
dont
seriously
believe
that
it
was

for
the
mark

weird

im

know
efi
auto
miles
when
i
drive
tha
car
long
enough
to
get
it
hot
especially
at
highways
speeds
the
transmission
has
this
nasty
habit
of
getting
stuck
in
gear
as
a
result
when
you
stop
for
a
light
the
motor
stalls
putting
the
car
in
park
and
waiting
for
seconds
before
restarting
sometimes
allows
the
transmission
to
reset
and
go
back
into
otherwise
it
just
stalls
when
put
in
drive
my
thoughts
either
it
the
gear
band
is
binding
and
getting
stuck
when
it
gets
hot
not
so
likely
or
perhaps
the
lockup
converter
is
not
disengaging
properly
seems
likely
the
least
likely
keeping
fingers
crossed
is
that
some
critical
vacuum
hose
has
brokencracked
and
this
behaviour
is
due
to
lack
of

query
hi
folks
i
recently
bought
a
mercury
capri
my
first
car
ever
i
have
noticed
a
few
problems
with
the
car
it
gives
very
low
gas
mileage
something
like
miles
gallon
i
hear
other
car
owners
speak
of
gasmileage
figures
like
milesgallon
wow
etc
when
i
start
the
car
it
goes
into
high
idling
something
like
or
is
it
rpm
after
driving
or
miles
it
comes
down
to
or
rpm
i
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
any
way
by
which
i
can
fix
these
problems
or
is
it
natural
for
an
old
car
like
this
it
has
done
about
miles
someone
suggested
that
i
changerebuild
recondition
the
carburettor
i
am
not
prepared
to
do
it
unless
i
am
sure
it
will
fix
the
problem
and
yes
i
got
the
car
tunedup
recently
within
the
last
miles
or
so
please
let

the

worked
very
well
the

used
a

with

was
effectively
an

and
worked
pretty

the
negatives
were
mostly
that
it
was
about
less

heard

being

is
there
anything
in

install
scrubbers

how
about
the
feasibility
of
installing

would
it
be
any

than
a

id
assume
easier
since
were
removing
particulate

instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
the
technology
cummins
is
applying
to
diesels
to
comply
with
the
newer
ca
emissions
laws
involves
three
things
i
know
of
all
compliant
diesels
are
turbocharged
all
use
an
aftercooler
which
cools
the
air
which
was
heated
by
compression
by
the
turbocharger
up
to
about
psi
a
gismo
on
the
injector
pump
which
senses
the
pressurized
air
intake
and
limits
full
delivery
of
fuel
while
the
pressure
is
low
no
scrubbers
catalytic
converters
etc
are
used
the
path
from
the
turbocharger
to
the
exhaust
outlet
is
kept
very
free
interestingly
except
for
the
lowpressure
fuel
limitation
power
output
and
mileage
are
enhanced
by
these
measures
one
can
buy
aftermarket
turbos
and

which
generate
more

there
are
two
crank
configurations
for
the
flat
the
most
common
one
is
probably
the
crank
that
is
very
similar
to
the
crank
which
flat
engines
have
style
cranks
comparing
those
two
engines
the
and
the
flat
have
no
first
order
shaking
forces
or
rocking
moments
the
has
a
second
order
shaking
force
while
the
flat
has
a
second
order
rocking
moment
the
significant
thing
about
the
flat
second
order
moment
is
that
it
can
be
easily
balanced
out
by
adding
mass
at
the
ends
of
the
crank
the
however
requires
a
counter
rotating
shaft
with
mass
to
balance
out
the
second
order
forces
i
am
sure
that
subaru
and
porsche
use
the
boxer
configuration
and
not
the
inline
crank
that
you
analyzed
and
compared
would
you
care
to
reevaluate
the
other
case
of
a
flat
four
i
think
that
this
configuration
is
perfectly
balanced
as
far
as
primary
secondary
forces
and
couples
are
concerned
i
have
an
article
in
front
of
me
that
says
so
bottom
line
the
biggest
difference
between
the
engines
would
probably
be
their
intended
use
the
flat
is
easier
to
fit
under
low
hoods
and
in
rear
compartments
for
mid
or
rear
mounting
the
can
be
mounted
transversely
to
reduce
hood
length
read
cab
forward
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
fanfare
to
the
differences
between
them
no
matter
what
subaru
ads
say
technology
shared
with
porsche
indeed
the
flat
four
is
also
shorter
than
an
inline
so
even
if
it
is
mounted
longitudinally
it
will
not
take
up
lots
of
length
and
a
longitudinal
placement
is
easier
for
a
wheel
drive
drivetrain
i
think
that
subarus
ads
hold
water
in
practice
their
flat
fours
are
noticeably
smoother
than
inline
and
completely
buzz
free
though
some
may
not
like
its
peculiar
note
but
as
alfa
has
shown
a
boxer
four
can

that

i
used
to
have

and
whenever
a
cop
would
pull
me
over
see
the

give
me
a
ticket
one
time
my

was
driving
and
had
it
in

it
was

and
she
got
a

in
i
had
received
tickets
because
of
it
one
for
my

so
a
total
of
five
that
was
five
years
ago
now
i
dont
have
one
and
have
not
gotten
a
ticket
my
driving
habits
have
not
changed
drastically
only
two
days
ago
i
was
going
mph
on
highway
with
mph
limit
cop
saw
me
i
break
a
little
nothing
happened
i
was
driving
a
minivan
with
my
family
in
it
otherwise
i
have
cutlass
supreme
which
i
do
most
of
the
times
on
the
highway
so
basically
my
opnion
is
not
to
get
one
if
you
do
get
pulled
over
the
cop
will
hear
your
excuse
but
if
you
have
a
radar
detecter
he
will
not
again
this
has
been
my
experienc
just
get
a
remote
model
that
is
not
visible
to
the
cop
but
be
sure
to
get
front
and
rear
sensors
you
can
also
just
put
the
detector
off
to
the
side
on
the
dash
so
the
cop
doesnt
see
it
right
awayvalentine
is
the
best
detector
by
far
as
stated
by
car
and
driver
and
even
tells
you
what
direction
the
radar
is
coming
from
it
also
gives
the
amount
of
threats
it
is
picking
up
so
if
you
go
through
the
same
place
everyday
and
it
always
goes
off
there
you
can
glance
at
the
number
of
threats
the
valentine
is
detecting
to
see
if
it
is
a

car
it

more

because
its

is
more
embedded

dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
the

magazines
have
printed
a
lot
of

about
the

the
consensus
about
what
to
believe
in
my
car
circle
is
that
the
suspension
pieces
and
tuning
will
be
almost
identical
to
the

on

stiffer

will

therefore
probably
do

priority
undisguised
the

looks
ok

not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the

imo
i
suspect
ford
will
produce
their

with
higher
quality

will
achieve

re
what

this
you
guys
are
correct
the
bricklin
was
produced
in
canada
the
national
museum
of
science
and
technology
here
in
ottawa
has
one
and
sometimes
they
put
it
on
display
most
of
the
time
it
stays
in
storage
because
the
museum
doesnt
have
much
room
its
a
big
deal
for
a
car
to
be
canadian
and
thats
why
they
have
it
if
anybodys
a
fan
they
also
have
a
nice
green
riviera
that
looks
like
it
just
came

camrys

cyls
i
have
both
an
and
an
camry
each
with
manual
transmissions
the
has
about
miles
on
it
and
the
about
miles
about
a
year
ago
i
found
that
the
master
cylinder
on
the
clutch
in
the
was
leaking
fluid
around
the
piston
seal
leading
to
air
in
the
system
and
fluid
back
into
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car
i
pulled
the
plunger
and
got
a
rebuild
kit
new
plunger
seal
etc
and
thought
i
had
the
problem
licked
much
to
my
surprise
the
same
problem
developed
several
months
later
this
time
i
looked
carefully
at
the
master
cylinder
to
make
sure
there
were
no
scratches
burrs
or
other
obvious
causes
of
the
problem
i
didnt
find
any
ever
since
i
have
been
periodically
feeding
the
clutch
hydraulins
additional
fluid
and
bleeding
air
from
the
system
i
knew
i
would
be
selling
the
car
and
didnt
want
to
go
all
the
way
to
solving
the
problem
i
should
add
that
the
clutch
is
original
and
that
ive
had
to
adjust
the
pedal
to
allow
maximum
extension
of
the
piston
into
the
master
cylinder
in
order
to
actuate
the
clutch
my
hypothesis
is
that
this
means
that
when
fully
depressing
the
clutch
pedal
the
angle
of
the
piston
rod
attached
to
the
pedal
is
off
the
axix
of
the
cylinder
thus
cocking
the
piston
and
seal
and
perhaps
deforming
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
an
explanation
can
you
suggest
a
possible
fix
short
of
replacing
the
master
cylinder
and
getting
a
new
clutch
put
in
now
the
same
problem
except
that
the
above
diagnosis
doesnt
explain
why
all
of
the
fluid
leaked
out
by
way
of
the
master
cylinder
into
the
passenger
compartment
while
i
was
on
vacation
for
days
during
which
the
clutch
pedal
was
not
depressed
or
otherwise
caused
to
distort
what
can

i
think
this
may
be
something
that
ford

corrected
since
the

of

also
someone
said
that
ford
has
issued
a

inform
dealers
about
how
to
correct
this

so
you
may
be

i
have
had
my

looked
at
twice
by
my
local
dealer
where
i
purchased
the

the

they
made
this

worse
the

they
said
they

im
not

something
was
missing

behind

in

and
not

personal
preference
i
am
seriously
considering
following
the
advice
in
the
owners
manual
where
it
describes
the
procedure
to
follow
if
you
discover
something
on
your
ford
that
could
cause
serious
injury
threaten
lives
etc
something
about
notifying
the
national
traffic
safety
group
as
well
as
ford
those
little
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep
buttons
are
terrible
the
latter
is
probably
because
of
the
air
bag
its
pretty
much
takes
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn
speaking
of
the
horn
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
probe
comes
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sounding
horns
instead
of
the
japanese
sounding
kind
the
previous
probes
had
japanese
horns
well
i
guess
thats
good
in
a
way
but
in
a
way
its
bad
when
someone
hears
that
kind
of
horn
they
expect
to
see
a
big
american
car
they
may
not
associate
the
sound
with
a
small
jap

style
car
like
the

is

not

be

the

is
a
must
i
have
always
been
a
guy
almost
every
car
ive
ever
owned
has
been
a
because
i
got
a
good
deal
on
this
car
with
the
miles
i
knowingly
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
has
an
automatic
but
it
is
a
pretty
hightech
automatic
it
is
a
fully
electronicaly
controlled
with
torque
converter
lockup
even
with
the
automatic
im
getting
mpg
on
the
highway
driving
but
of
course
driving
is
illegal
so
i
probably
made
that
sentence
up
around
town
the
mileage
has
been
around
not
bad
for
an
automatic
of
course
it
doesnt
have
the
control
of
a
but
since
i
do
a
lot
of
city
driving
it
turns
out
to
be
very
convenient
its
nice
to
be
able
to
drink
a

ive

of
them

i
fear
that
with

will
be
a

when
i
tradeed
the
car
the
firestones
on
my
probe
look
like
theyre
designed
for
performance
ie
rather
wide
shallow
tread
etc
so
they
probably
wont
last
as
long
but
the
car
handles
very
very
very
well
it
sticks
to
the
road
like
glue
even
on
a
rough
surface
interior
is
very
very
nice
too
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
ergonomically
sound
definitely
fordmazda
did
a
very
very
nice
job
on
this
one
the
car
has
a
much
more
expensive
than
it
actually
is
look
and
feel
to
it
yes
this
cars
stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
having
driven
an
probe
for
years
i
find
the
suspension
interesting
the
car
actually
drives
much
better
than
the
it
is
a
very
firm
ride
and
you
definitely
know
about
each
and
every
bump
in
the
road
yet
the
car
remains
very
civilized
on
even
the
bumpiest
roads
you
hear
and
feel
the
bumps
yet
the
car
retains
its
posture
very
well
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
well
i
wouldnt
encourage
passengercarrying
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
likes
to
sit
with
his
knees
to
the
dash
as
mentioned
in
the
consumer
reports
writeups
consider
the
back
seat
as
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggie
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
its
definitely
not
a
family
car
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
ac
is
a
must
on
any

the
in

sends
out
a
real
blast
of
cool
air
when
the
ac
is
on
max
that
lots
of
glass
you

what
gives

most
sportssporty

dont

good

ive
heard

the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
the
complaints
ive
heard
re

on
have
been
on
the
gt
of

being

different

that
is
a
differeent
exhaust
system
i
was
one
of
those
with
an
who
qualified
for
the
free
replacement
since
i
had
already
replaced
the
muffler
when
i
received
the
notice
i
wasam
due
a
refund
from
ford
i
applied
in
february
and
am
still
waiting
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
was
without
my
car
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
way
they
handledespecially
considering
that
i
was
expecting
the
worst
from
them
yes
i
was
pretty
amazed
when
i
had
my
car
in
for
some
touchup
adjustments
this
past
week
and
they
had
to
keep
it
overnight
too
busy
for
them
to
get
to
it
and
they
offered
to
pay
for
a
rental
they
did
make
me
pay
for
taxes
and
insurance
though
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
i
have
to
agree
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
seriously
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
very
well

complain

remember
roads

are
not

above
meaning
they
would
be

the

thats

before
the

on

turnpike

were
no

i
wasnt

enough
here
i
said
the
roads
were

so

still

the

will
add

actually
the

were

the

after
too
many
years
of
school
im
finally
graduating
and
getting
a
real
job
of
course
i
am
trying
to
make
plans
of
how
to
spend
all
this
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
on
a
sports
car
of
some
kind
after
thinking
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drops
and
buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a
corvette
stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
early
for
around
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycle
and
what
are
good
prices
to
vettes
had
the
same
basic
chassis
add
aluminum
weaker
rear
axle
housing
all
these
years
used
same
brakes
similar
springs
etc
late
was
a
bad
year
for
gm
reliability
catastrophic
converter
was
added
in
cheapest
corvette
to
low
end
about
tops
out
about
except
for
those
morooons
that
think
there
indy
aniversity
vette
is
special
these
guys
have
been
known
to
ask
i
dont
think
they
get
it
best
buy
convertables
i
got
my
for
needs
body
work
but
im
willing
parts
for
all
are
readily
avail
at
swap
meets
and
mail
order
etc
reliability
looks
independant
suspension
wheel
disk
and
all
under
and
they
thought
a
miata
was
a
good
deal
also
what
would
insurance
look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
my
origional
inquires
to
my
insurance
agent
i
can
drive
my
convertable
for
miles
or
less
per
year
i
must
keep
it
in
a
locked
garage
and
it
will
cost
me
of
the
stated
value
per
year
does
this
sound
right
ive
also
been
looking
at
vettes
recently
and
found
a
convertible
that
i
like
at
a
dealer
i
currently
own
an
ford
escort
gt
which
is
insured
through
state
farm
i
called
em
up
and
asked
about
the
rates
if
i
sell
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
if
i
keep
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
the
escorts
insurance
goes
down
by
to
approx
per
months
im
male
and
have
a
good
driver
discount
another
variable
would
be
where
you
live
best
bet
is
to
just
call
up
some
insurance
brokers
and
get
a
quote
state
farm
says
they
base
the
price
on
the
fair
market
value
of
the
car
which
is
determined
by
an
outside
apprasier
they
look
in
the
newspaper
and
call
up
dealers
to
find
out
what
the
going
rate
is
and
adjust
it
for
the
condition
of
the
car
to
get
the
values
above
they
went
on
the
selling
price
of
the
car
the
dealers
asking
price
is
i
need
to
do
research
to
find
out
if
this
is
reasonable
in
any
case
i
told
state
farm
the
value
was
get
an
appraiser
to
look
at
the
car
he
will
check
serial
numbers
and
look
for
origional
equipe
depending
on
what
mods
have
been
done
the
car
could
be
worth
only
problems
like
wrong
engine
trans
wrong
paint
type
vetts
used
lacquer
an
modification
would
reduce
tthe
value
but
your
looking
for
a
car
to
drive
right
this
sounds

review
of
ford
taurus
sho
by
gene
kim
background
last
week
i
bought
a
ford
taurus
sho
moving
up
from
driving
a
toyota
celica
st
and
a
oldsmobile
cutlass
i
have
been
interested
in
buying
a
sho
for
about
five
months
and
have
been
combing
the
classifieds
in
denver
and
chicago
every
week
i
bought
a
remarkably
clean
maroonred
sho
with
miles
on
it
for
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
about
under
blue
book
and
i
still
have
another
miles
before
the
extended
service
plan
runs
out
as
one
should
with
any
shos
i
made
sure
that
the
car
was
already
refit
with
the
upgraded
clutch
and
pressure
plate
as
well
as
having
been
recalled
for
upgraded
rotors
and
seatbelt
attachments
however
my
sho
does
not
have
the
newer
rod
shifter
i
understand
i
can
get
this
for
from
any
ford
service
center
in
addition
the
car
received
the
full
tuneup
at
miles
receiving
new
platinum
plugs
and
valve
adjustment
for
a
car
with
miles
on
it
the
car
was
virtually
immaculate
the
clearcoat
paint
job
was
devoid
of
any
large
chips
or
dents
although
the
front
airdammolding
was
covered
with
lots
of
small
scratches
not
surprising
since
most
of
the
miles
were
spent
on
the
highway
having
driven
a
smaller
twodoor
coupe
for
so
long
i
was
a
bit
concerned
about
whether
i
could
get
used
to
driving
a
larger
car
to
my
surprise
the
size
of
the
car
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
it
seems
just
as
nimble
as
my
celica
no
comparisons
with
my
oldsmobile
visibility
from
the
drivers
seat
is
excellent
helped
mostly
by
of
the
small
the
quarterwindows
aft
of
the
backseat
door
windows
and
in
front
of
the
cpillar
and
rear
window
parallel
parking
is
a
bit
more
difficult
but
other
than
that
i
love
the
size
in
fact
im
starting
to
appreciate
the
large
trunk
as
i
pack
up
for
a
drive
to
washington
dc
for
the
summer
more
on
the
ride
later
in
this
review
engine
as
with
anyone
even
slightly
interested
in
shos
i
was
very
interested
in
the
yamaha
shogun
engine
i
was
not
disappointed
base
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
is
good
you
can
even
do
reasonable
launches
from
second
gear
although
i
dont
make
a
practice
of
this
the
engine
revs
smoothly
and
eagerly
tooling
around
town
does
not
require
many
shifts
this
is
good
since
the
shifter
is
definitely
one
of
the
weakest
points
of
the
car
more
on
this
later
while
the
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
may
be
unremarkable
it
undergoes
a
jekyllhyde
transformation
once
you
hit
higher
revs
at
rpms
a
butterfly
valve
opens
and
you
can
literally
hear
and
feel
the
geometry
of
the
engine
changing
as
twelve
more
valves
open
up
the
engine
soars
to
its
rpm
redline
and
you
are
treated
to
in
my
opinion
the
sweetest
sounding
around
the
engine
inexplicably
sounds
overjoyed
to
be
at
rpm
ive
noticed
that
when
i
drive
around
town
i
constantly
watch
the
tach
to
see
how
far
below
rpm
i
am
to
go
from
rpm
to
you
may
have
to
punch
the
accelerator
while
torque
is
more
than
adequate
it
doesnt
come
fully
online
until
those
other
valves
are
used
transmission
when
car
and
driver
first
reviewed
the
car
in
they
marvelled
at
how
ford
had
put
such
a
wimpy
clutch
and
balky
shifter
into
the
car
i
remember
driving
a
friends
parents
sho
in
and
remember
thinking
about
whether
i
had
the
leg
strength
to
drive
the
car
in
traffic
the
clutch
was
that
stiff
that
was
back
then
the
entire
clutch
assembly
on
my
sho
has
been
replaced
under
a
ford
recall
in
the
clutch
on
the
sho
feels
no
stiffer
than
the
one
on
my
toyota
celica
in
fact
the
friction
point
seems
a
bit
larger
and
more
forgiving
when
playing
with
the
shifter
with
the
car
parked
the
shifter
felt
very
reasonable
the
and
gates
were
where
youd
expect
it
to
be
and
the
shifting
action
was
smooth
on
the
road
its
much
the
same
but
you
have
to
shift
slowly
make
no
mistake
its
a
clumsy
shifter
when
hurrying
shifts
like
when
i
was
initially
trying
to
impress
friends
i
consistently
miss
the
shift
often
grope
clumsily
for
the
shift
and
sometimes
even
muff
the
shift
i
find
this
pretty
amazing
in
a
car
like
this
it
also
took
me
several
days
to
realize
that
you
get
the
smoothest
shifts
when
you
take
your
time
seems
obvious
but
compared
to
my
toyota
and
my
friends
honda
this
seems
atrocious
and
clumsy
someone
on
recautos
noted
that
crxs
should
blow
shos
offtheline
because
of
the
incredibly
clumsy
shifter
i
now
shift
much
more
sedately
and
the
shifter
seems
more
reasonable
when
you
play
within
these
bounds
the
shifter
works
smoothly
with
no
surprises
i
dont
know
whether
the
rod
shifter
upgrade
would
help
at
all
along
these
same
lines
i
initially
had
trouble
shifting
gears
smoothly
again
slowing
down
the
shifts
and
taking
more
care
to
match
revs
when
letting
out
the
clutch
helped
immensely
this
took
several
days
for
me
to
get
the
hang
of
i
think
some
of
my
problems
were
because
ive
never
had
a
car
with
enough
power
to
balk
at
bad
shifts
in
higher
gears
occasionally
i
have
trouble
shifting
into
reverse
the
shifter
refuses
to
enter
the
gate
and
i
often
grind
the
synchros
trying
to
get
it
into
gear
ill
be
watching
this
carefully
in
the
next
couple
of
months
a
quirk
when
i
upshift
and
the
engine
drops
back
to
rpm
i
hear
a
whirring
and
then
a
grinding
noise
coming
from
the
the
engine
compartment
not
terribly
loud
but
the
passenger
can
definitely
hear
it
i
asked
about
it
when
i
was
looking
at
the
car
as
do
all
my
passengers
apparently
this
is
a
definitely
a
sho
sound
and
is
the
gearbox
apparently
called
gear
rollover
replies
to
my
queries
on
recautos
are
at
the
end
of
this
review
exterior
as
i
mentioned
before
i
am
astounded
by
how
well
the
body
of
this
sho
has
stood
up
paint
chipping
on
the
front
bumper
and
grille
are
virtually
nonexistent
looking
at
how
older
tauri
sometimes
dont
age
so
gracefully
i
wonder
what
the
guys
at
ford
did
differently
to
the
sho
bodies
the
body
in
my
opinion
is
extremely
attractive
with
matching
color
body
moldings
than
the
stock
tauri
for
some
odd
reason
the
sho
seems
different
enough
from
vanilla
tauri
to
get
stares
at
stoplights
of
course
this
could
be
my
overactive
imagination
shos
get
fog
lights
a
more
open
grille
a
completely
monochromatic
exterior
and
a
deeper
ground
skirt
in
the
back
with
sho
stenciled
in
relief
ive
seen
a
couple
shos
whose
owners
have
colored
these
in
with
florescent
colors
or
in
black
yuck
i
dont
think
the
car
is
flashy
i
like
it
that
way
i
feel
almost
anonymous
with
all
those
tauri
out
there
but
different
and
distinctive
enough
to
those
of
us
who
care
interior
the
interior
is
what
really
makes
me
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
the
car
the
seats
are
grey
leather
the
steering
wheel
and
shifter
are
covered
with
black
leather
and
the
entire
instrument
panel
is
done
in
a
blackgreymetallic
scheme
the
instrumentation
is
stock
taurus
except
for
the
mph
speedo
and
rpm
tach
you
get
a
center
console
with
two
cupholders
a
large
compartment
under
the
radio
great
for
a
cd
player
an
armrest
that
contains
yet
another
compartment
three
appropriately
sized
coin
holders
for
tollways
i
think
and
a
compartment
for
holding
cassette
tapes
theres
mapholders
in
the
doors
and
an
oddly
small
glove
compartment
i
spilled
a
whole
can
of
coke
in
the
cupholder
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
entire
rubber
holder
can
be
removed
and
washed
in
a
sink
hey
im
really
impressed
with
the
ergonomics
and
thoughtfulness
that
went
into
its
design
and
its
a
before
the
interior
was
upgraded
the
backseat
is
bigger
than
any
car
ive
had
why
do
they
need
so
much
space
no
smartass
comments
please
the
driver
and
passenger
seat
have
lumbar
and
side
bolsters
from
what

instead
they
have
the
regular
parking
brake
that
you
press
with
your
left
foot
too
bad
again
im
getting
used
to
it
but
it
seems
a
bit
anachronistic
to
me
ride
the
suspension
is
nice
and
stiff
too
stiff
its
stiffer
than
any
car
ive
had
a
friends
new
toyota
celica
st
seems
tauter
and
is
still
able
to
soak
up
bumps
better
the
sho
seems
stiffer
with
less
ability
to

driving
over
railroad
tracks
is
a
noisy
and
jarring
affair
on
the
other
hand
taking
turns
feels
wonderful
because
the
body
is
so
rigid
and
doesnt
flex
at
all
i
listened
for
that
before
i
bought
the
car
on
the
highway
the
ride
is
great
when
i
drove
the
car
from
chicago
back
to
purdue
i
had
trouble
keeping
under
mph
let
alone
from
trying
to
see
what
mph
really
feels
like
its
a
relatively
quiet
ride
but
the
sunroof
rattles
ive
tried
to
find
out
what
exactly
makes
all
the
noise
up
there
but
it
seems
to
be
the
window
that
rests
on
the
rails
no
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
it
i
think
over
the
past
three
days
ive
oscillated
between
thinking
the
suspension
is
wonderful
and
perfect
and
thinking
that
the
ride
is
way
too
rough
not
for
me
mind
you
but
i
wonder
whether
i
would
advise
my
dad
to
buy
one
for
himself
but
ive
discovered
as
with
the
shifter
if
you
take
your
time
with
shifts
youll
have
no
reason
to
complain
let
me
explain
the
ride
is
worst
when
turning
and
applying
lots
of
power
to
the
wheels
i
feel
the
wheels
scrabbling
for
traction
and
torque
steer
making
the
car
skitter
left
and
right
after
i
understood
this
i
avoid
the
limits
of
traction
and
im
a
happy
camper
again
its
not
body
rigidity
but
the
composure
of
the
car
as
if
matching
the
suspension
the
steering
feel
is
quite
heavy
my
first
impression
of
driving
my
sho
was
how
hard
you
had
to
turn
the
wheel
at
highway
speeds
it
tracks
straight
as
an
arrow
but
when
driving
around
a
parking
lot
the
higheffort
steering
didnt
seem
so
useful
however
its
reasonable
but
it
doesnt
communicate
the
road
to
the
driver
as
well
as
a
ford
probe
gt
imho
its
much
better
than
the
steering
on
my
celica
st
i
wonder
how
bad
this
car
is
during
winter
miscellaneous
notes
gripes
the
rattles
from
the
sunroof
is
intermittent
some
days
it
rattles
loudly
other
days
i
look
up
wondering
where
all
the
noise
went
activating
the
sunroof
is
sometimes
very
noisy
loud
squealing
as
it
retracts
on
its
rails
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
quick
fix
for
this
again
other
days
it
completely
disappears
function
of
humidity
once
i
made
the
connection
between
the
sometimes
awful
feeling
suspension
and
torque
steer
ive
never
complained
about
ride
i
wish
the
seats
had
more
support
under
the
thighs
also
i
wish
the
side
bolsters
would
close
more
tightly
i
hear
that
tires
for
this
car
can
get
really
expensive
i
currently
have
goodyear
that
cost
the
previous
owner
for
four
i
used
to
hate
the
ford
stereo
systems
whose
idea
was
it
to
use
a
volume
paddle
now
to
my
amazement
i
dont
really
mind
and
sometimes
think
its
an
okay
idea
pretty
ridiculous
though
getting
up
to
rpm
sometimes
seems
to
be
a
chore
but
this
is
no
big
deal
there
is
more
than
enough
torque
down
low
i
often
goof
up
the
shifting
when
driving
with
friends
it
took
me
a
couple
of
days
before
i
could
really
shift
smoothly
from
to
gear
hard
to
believe
isnt
it
my
car
has
almost
miles
on
it
my
parents
noted
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
lowmileage
sho
astute
observation
imho
i
wonder
how
long
i
can
make
my
sho
last
i
just
bought
a
book
titled
drive
it
forever
for
tips
in
this
department
the
goofy
parking
brake
pedal
still
throws
me
for
a
loop
i
once
parked
the
car
in
gear
and
then
accidentally
let
out
the
clutch
after
i
started
it
the
car
jolted
forward
and
bounced
off
the
car
in
front
of
me
no
paint
damage
at
all
but
starting
the
car
is
a
whole
new
ritual
for
me
with
that
fangled
pedal
also
i
began
to
wonder
how
strong
that
brake
really
is
today
i
backed
out
of
parking
spot
today
and
started
to
drive
away
before
i
noticed
the
glowing
brake
light
oops
the
drivers
power
window
creaks
when
closed
all
the
way
the
same
thing
happens
in
my
parents
mercury
sable
oddly
all
the
other
windows
work
smoothly
likes
im
liking
the
interior
amenities
more
and
more
each
day
the
cupholders
are
great
i
didnt
expect
to
use
the
keyless
entry
buttons
so
much
but
it
really
is
handy
you
can
lock
all
the
doors
by
pressing
the
and
buttons
together
neat
and
you
can
never
lock
yourself
out
of
the
car
i
really
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
this
car
i
really
cant
believe
that
i
could
afford
it
i
got
this
car
ten
years
ahead
of
schedule
i
love
this
car
so
much
that
ive
been
telling
my
parents
to
look
into
buying
one
i
love

so

another
car

in

im
sure
id
buy
another

you
cant
beat

its

the
from
any

or
series
unless
you
look
real
close
i
really
do
think
volvos
are
all
dogs
though
beacuse
they
are
while
previous
volvos
have
been
essentially
very
fast
tractors
the
and
series
are
far
from
agricultural
in
design
or
execution
how
many
fwd
tractors
have
you
seen
godlier
than
thou
advertising
you
state
this
like
it
is
a
bad
thing
remember
car
companies
use
ad
agencies
they
dont
do
their
own
ads
part
of
renault
is
this
true
i
know
that
they
had
done
joint
ventures
with
renault
but
i
havent
heard
about
their
subsumption
into
renault
does
this
mean
that
the
french
government
now
owns
volvo
anyway
renault
makes
some
very
nice
cars
they
just
dont
sell
em
in
n
america
however
one
thing
that
i
do
think
is
in
their
favour
is
that
they
are
immediately
recognisable
as
a
volvo
and
that
is
not
something
you
can
say
about
most
japanese
manufacturers
and
ford
saab
also
have

help
i
am
considering
the
purchse
of
a
vw
jetta
gli
with
miles
on
it
i
recently
found
out
that
there
are
two
versions
of
the
gli
and
i
know
of
three
differences
between
the
two
cars
that
both
carry
the
same
name
the
version
has
more
horsepower
wheel
discs
and
a
standard
sunroof
oops
thats
the
difference
between
the
gli
and
the
regular
gl
so
in
addition
to
the
engine
what
other
differences
exist
between
the
two
models
of
the
jetta
gli
more
importantly
how
can
i
tell
which
version
this
one
is
there
are
no
badges
that
said
so
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
is
the
version
assuming
this
one
the
one
i
looked
at
is
the
version
is
there
a
valid
reason
to
buy
it
instead
of
a
comparably
equipped
gl
which
would
cost
less
of
course
i
would
love
to
get
the
version
but

very

i

every

on

would
be

theyre

at

such

mostly
flat

in

is

it

aint

given

car
for

with

new

came
out
in

not
september
like

makes
the
car
was
purchased
in
august
of
that
year
we
also
had
a
much
older
clunker
for
which
we
only
wanted
liability
low
and
behold
a
vandal
slashed
the
roof
of
the
sports
car
and
we
put
in
a
claim
this
was
in
october
still
the
current
model
year
for
the
car
a
new
top
with
installation
was
we
had
deductible
so
we
should
have
gotten
you
had
to
go
to
geicos
local
office
to
have
an
adjuster
see
the
car
unlike
state
farm
that
sent
the
adjusters
to
the
shop
or
your
place
he
said
since
the
car
is
now
one
year
old
well
depreciate
the
top
by
so
youll
get
on
the
claim
this
will
also
count
as
an
accident
against
you
so
your
rate
may
increase
the
hassle
continued
then
we
got
a
letter
from
geico
saying
claim
denied
your
policy
on
this
car
doesnt
cover
this
i
then
learned
that
their
records
had
the
full
coverage
collision
etc
on
our
old
clunker
and
only
had
liability
for
this
new
car
they
mixed
up
our
cars
in
their
records
i
fixed
the
top
myself
with
some
carpet
thread
and
dropped
my
claim
they
still
charged
me
with
an
accident
i
cancelled
my
policy
and
switched
to
another
company
the

came

have

around

free
of

i
bought
one
for
my
wife
nnnnnnnng
thank
you
for
playing
i
cannot
agree
with
this
i
believed
this
and
to
put
it
nicely
it
was
a
piece
of
junk
i
loved
this
car
i
babied
it
i
pampered
it
and
after
years
it
just
couldnt
stay
together
i
would
say
that
not
everyone
will
have
the
problems
that
i
had
but
know
this
its
not
just
the
car
it
is
the
ability
to
get
the
car
fixed
which
will
not
happen
at
any
chryslerdodgetake
your
pick
dealer
i
dont
care
if
there
are
going
to
reform
their
dealersservice
with
the
intro
of
the
lh
cars
i
will
believe
it
when
i
see
it
case
and
point
the
local
dodge
dealer
you
drive
up
just
looking
you
dont
even
get
out
of
your
door
when
about
yes
salesman
all
eye
you
like
their
next
meal
and
literally
pounce
on
you
and
try
to
get
you
to
make
a
deal
on
everything
your
eye
wanders
towards
service
is
about
times
worse
than
that
i
had
an
alignment
problem
but
they
tried
to
tell
me
that
the
k
frame
was
bent
and
about
dollars
of
workparts
to
fix
it
let
me
tell
you
the
problems
i
had
and
i
took
care
of
this
car
i
put
alot
of
miles
on
it
in
the
first
couple
years
but
took
it
to
every
checkup
it
needed
and
many
that
shouldnt
have
been
dodge
shadow
es
these
were
replaced
within
the
years
that
i
owned
the
car
engine
alternators

suspension
torsion
bar
water
pumps
thermostats
hall
effect
sensor
main
computer
batteries
these
were
rebuiltrepaired
radiator
automatic
transmission
power
steering
those
are
just
the
things
i
can
remember
off
the
top
of
my
head
for
about
a
year
before
i
sold
the
car
i
said
to
myself
its
a
good
car
i
just
cant
find
anybody
competent
enough
the
fix
it
in
the
end
before
i
traded
it
in
for
a
saturn
the
power
steering
started
acting
up
again
i
just
stopped
putting
money
into
it
i
must
have
put
at
least
worth
of
repairs
over
its
lifetime
i
am
sorry
but
lee
iacocca
can
bite
me
bullshit
whoever
backs
em
best
is
just
afraid
the
stupid
things
are
going
to
fall
apart
and
no
one
will
buy
them
without
assurance
why
the
hell
do
you
think
that
lh
has
been
nicknamed
last
hope
you
can
do
better
and
i
know
people
will
disagree
with
me
here
but
japanese
like
honda
or
toyota
or
the
only
american
car
company
that
i
feel
is
a
quality
product
saturn
i
will
not
touch
another
chrysler
product
again
no
way
i
dont
care
how
good
the
lh
cars
look
good
and
i
will
admit
they
look
promising
but
not
with
the
support
that
you
get
gm
isnt
much
better
thank
god
they
dont
control
saturn
like
they
do
their
divisions
or
it
would
be
just
another
marketing
ploy
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
be
watching
my
car
which
i
do
like
like
a
hawk
for
the
next
years
i
am
much
more
hesitant
to
say
it
or
any
car
is
really
good
until
it
has
proved
itself
to
me
but
since
someone
else
pointed
out
cd
as
a
source
i
will
note
because
i
used
to
read
these
magazines
that
car
and
driver
has
never
had
a
good
thing
to
say
about
most
chrysler
products
shadow
for
one
always
were
they
moaning
about
the
reguritated
kcar
and
engine
whereas
motor
trend
always
thought
they
were
great
cars
no
car
magazine
is
really
objective
and
although
there
are
alot
of
people
who
dont
like
consumers
reports
i
will
use
them
to
reinforce
my
argument
i
already
know
about
the
big
stink
with
the
saturn
crash
tests
time
will
tell
how
good
a
car
they
are
the
shadowsundance
rate
much
worse
than
average
in
fact
none
of
the
chryslers
rate
a
better
than
average
i
think
the
best
one
is
just
average
excluding
the
diamond
starmitsubishi
stuff
and
the
lhs
you
can
find
bad
stuff
about
the
shadow
try
as
i
might
when
i
researched
the
saturn
i
could
not
find
anything
bad
about
it
there
is
a
great
deal
of
information
about
this
company
just
because
it
is
a
new
american
company
and
it
has
created
quite
a
stir
in
the
automotive
community
for
good
reason
much
more
than
the
introduction
of
any
new
model
lines
of
any
established
company
i
read
an
article
which
had
a
subcolumn
an
i
think
this
imprinted
on
me
more
than
anything
else
some
big
wig
in
toyota
said
and
i
quote
we
are
watching
them
very
closely
come
on
everybody
grow
up
the
foreign
cars
especially
the
japanese
have
been
kicking
our
butts
for
good
reason
the
american
car
companies
could
not
make
a
good
product
or
support
the
customer
the
way
they
want
these
days
to
set
in
their
ways
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
saturn
was
created
they
are
still
struggling
because
they
havent
learned
yet
they
have
the
ability
the
workers
are
not
inferior
the
technology
is
not
out
of
date
but
their
attitude
is
and
they
are
just
finding
this

give

some
pointers
on

more
of

there
is
usually
a
loud
thunk
from
the
rear
of
of
the
car
sounds
like
it
could
be
the

what
could
cause
this
is
the
differential
going
bad
i
recently
had
the
differential
fluid
changed
and
it
did
have
tiny
metal

in

i

that

is

the

i
can

i
cant

probably
could

jam

this
blows
a

is

kind

putting

cleaner
in

i
have
taken
parts
of
the

off

looked
at
the

system
and
i
think
the
problem
or
part
of
it
is
with
the
two
diaphragms
which
control
updown

outsideinside
air
flow
the
diaphragm
which
controls

sideno
vent
air
is
cracked
most

around
and
the
other
one
is
probably
damaged
too
considering
the
advanced
age
of

two
questions
is
there
anything
i
should
be
aware
of
about
this
other
than
the
fact
that
i
should
move
from

in

arent

is
there
a

have

differed

have

im
looking

anyone
whos
driven

three
have
any

ford

toyota
nissan
pathfinder
currently
im
leaning
toward
the
toyota
cause
ive
had
big
success
with
toyota
trucks
in

past
and
cause
i
think
its
the
best
looking
of
the
three
but
i
thought
id
see
if
anyone
has
any
strong
opinions
thanks
karl
i
agree
that
the
toyota
is
the
best
looking
i
just
didnt
fit
plus
it
is
the
highest
cost
of
all
the
ones
you
mentioned
i
have
good
friends
who
have
all
three
of
the
trucks
you
talked
about
the
ones
with
kids
all
went
to
the
ford
because
of
the
room
required
to
carry
a
couple
of
kids
and
all
the
junk
you
need
the
single
ones
went
for
the
toyota
and
the

every
one
has
been
happy
with

before

keep
in
mind
that
owning

car
in

is
a
luxury

only
the
ruling
class
can
afford
every
government
agency
worth
its
salt
finds
some
reason
to
levy
a
tax
on
car
ownership
last
i
heard
there
were
seven
different
fees
to
pay
to
own
a
car
i
believe
this
is
the
sort
of
petty
bureaucratic
inefficiency
that
new
president
kim
young
sam
wants
to
eradicate
basically
i
think
the
rules
came
into
place
as
bureaucrats
from
plebian
backgrounds
wanted
to
wreak
revenge
on
the
ruling
class
in
exchange
zaibatsus
like
hyundai
screwed
over
smaller
companies
perpetuating
a
vicious
cycle
i
have
faith
that
korean
people
can
potentially
build
cars
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
for
now
hyundai
cars
seem
to
reflect
the
tensions
within
society

screwy
components

affected

writes
now
now
before
we
get
too
carried
away
here
keep
in
mind
that
owning
any
car
in
korea
is
a
luxury
that
only
the
ruling
class
can
afford
every
government
agency
worth
its
salt
finds
some
reason
to
levy
a
tax
on
car
ownership
last
i
heard
there
were
seven
different
fees
to
pay
to
own
a
car
i
believe
this
is
the
sort
of
petty
bureaucratic
inefficiency
that
new
president
kim
young
sam
wants
to
eradicate
basically
i
think
the
rules
came
into
place
as
bureaucrats
from
plebian
backgrounds
wanted
to
wreak
revenge
on
the
ruling
class
in
exchange
zaibatsus
like
hyundai
screwed
over
smaller
companies
perpetuating
a
vicious
cycle
i
have
faith
that
korean
people
can
potentially
build
cars
as
well
as
anyone
else
but
for
now
hyundai
cars
seem
to
reflect
the
tensions
within
society
of
screwy
components
that
wont
work
together
stubborn
like
a
mule
the
car
either
wont
go
forward
or
wont
stop
at
all
hahahahahaha
gasp
pant
hm
im
not
sure
whether
the
above
was
just
a
silly
remark
or
a
serious
remark
but
in
case
there
are
some
misconceptions
i
think
henry
robertson
hasnt
updated
his
data
file
on
korea
sincemid
owning
a
car
in
korea
is
no
longer
a
luxury
most
middle
class
people
in
korea
can
afford
a
car
and
do
have
at
least
one
car
the
problem
in
korea
especially
in
seoul
is
that
there
are
just
so
many
privatelyowned
cars
as
well
as
taxis
and
buses
the
rushhour
has
become
a
hour
phenomenon
and
that
there
is
no
place
to
park
last
time
i
heard
back
in
january
the
kim
administration
wanted
to
legislate
a
law
requireing
a
potential
car
owner
to
provide
his
or
her
own
parking
area
just
like
they
do
in
japan
also
henry
would
be
glad
to
know
that
hyundai
isnt
the
only
car
manufacturer
in
korea
daewoo
has
always
manufactured
cars
and
i
believe
kia
is
back
in
business
as
well
imported
cars
such
as
mercury
sable
are
becoming
quite
popular
as
well
though
they

you
a

answer
then
this

ill
dump
my
impressions
ive
wanted
to
own
a
for
about
years
now
came
close
once
but
i
ended
up
buying
a
fiero
instead
biggest
mistake
of
my
life
anyway
for
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
nice
car
but
your
also
set
in
the
price
range
to
get
taken
by
a
nice
looker
that
is
a
pile
of
shit
the
most
common
total
failure
for
the
car
would
be
frame
rust
between
the
engine
and
passenger
compartment
also
look
for
chassis
welded
together
here
oh
yeah
the
price
range
you
are
talking
about
must
be
the
banger
a
if
you
could
find
one
would
be
mucho
more
bucks
parts
for
the
engine
are
pretty
easy
to
come
by
for
an
old
car
and
you
can
even
locate
crude
in
the
jc
whitney
catalog
if
you
have
too
the
machine
itself
is
pretty
simple
they
use
the
spare
tire
for
windshild
washer
instead
of
a
pump
fer
chris
sake
so
getting
it
fixed
by
a
good
bugporsche
mechanic
would
be
easy
since
it
is
midengine
you
may
spend
more

today
i
paid
a
visit
to
an
old

whose
love
for
audis
has
been
so
overwhelming
that
he
makes
a
not
too
sucessful
living
selling

without
further
delay
i
will
get
to

servotronic
steering
for
those
who
are
not

with
what

is
it
is
the
name
for
the
speed
variable
power
steering
manufactured
by
zf
and
used
in
audis
and
bmws
i
have
been
outspoken
in
my
damming
of
servotronic
over
the
past
couple
of
months
and
this
was
based
on
magazine
reviews
and
drives
of
the
audi
cs
quattro
and
the
audi
fwd
i
am
quite
happy
to
report
now
that
on
the
the
servotronic
is
inoffensive
i
suppose
that
due
to
the
fat
gumball
tires
the
servotronic
has
been
loaded
up
more
and
this
so
far
has
been
the
best
implementation
that
i
have
tried
it
is
far
from
perfect
mind
you
and
id
be
much
happier
if
it
was
an
option
that
i
could
refuse
but
on
the
i
no
longer
consider
this
to
be
bad
enough
where
i
feel
the
entire
car
is
ruined
the
steering
is
still
a
tad
too
light
but
it
is
accurate
and
i
suppose
the
stiffly
sprung
chassis
sends
back
so
much
information
that
some
makes
it
through
to
the
drivers
hands
so
there
is
feel
and
there
is
accuracy
in
the
steering
but
there
is
also
room
for
improvement
i
consider
the
steering
to
be
better
than
the
japanese
competition
primarily
because
the
japanese
do
not
believe
in
feel
and
engineer

completely

what

i
did

the

anywhere
close
to
what
it
will
be
putting
out
miles
later
but
still
the
car
packs
a
terrific
punch
for
a
turbocharged
machine
it
is
very
unusual
in
that
it
encourages
lazy
driving
ie
low
revs
high
gear
it
is
so
supremely
flexible
that
one
could
hardly
believe
that
theres
only
liters
of
displacement
to
move
this
pound
car
around
in
such
a
fashion
with
maximum
torque
available
at

and
a

additional
turbo
boost
for
passing
sort
of
like
lighting
up
the
after
burners
in
a
jet
fighter
one
could
with
the
right
foot
only
in
third
gear
blast
the
car
from
to
in
just
a
few
moments
simply
by
flooring
the
gas
as
far
as
the
numbers
go
maximum
torque
available
in
overboost
mode
shoots
up
to
about
lb
ft
incredible
for
a
liter
it
takes
a
few
moments
for
it
to
develop
overboost
but
it
is
well
worth
waiting
for
since
this
is
quite
a
heavy
car
ones
body
parts
are
not
flung
around
like
say
the
corrado
the
acceleration
is
smooth
and
strong
somewhat
similar
to
riding
in
a
jetliner
as
it
accelerates
down
the
runway
on
takeoff
also
one
is
treated
to
a
very
distinctive
and
entertaining
whistle
from
the
turbo
the
only
entertaining
sound
to
come
out
of
a
very
refined
but
bland
sounding
banger
yes
audi
has
refined
the
to
the
point
where
at
rpm
it
sounds
as
serene
as
it
does
at
the
smoothness
is
outstanding
but
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
a
very
good
eg
a
valve
bmw
id
say
that
in
terms
of
refinement
ie
willingness
to
rev
smoothness
lack
of
harshness
under
full
acceleration
it
is
better
than
many
however
lost
in
the
refinement
process
is
the
characteristic
cylinder
bark
that
made
the
older
engines
so
characterful
if
not
terribly
refined
the
valve
turbo
sounds
pretty
bland
except
for
the
whistle
under
full
boost
subjectively
id
rate
the
vw
engine
as
being
far
more
musical
than
the
turbo
also
audis
own
is
also
far
more
musical
with
a
rorty
race
car
growl
when
pressed
though
none
of
these
can
match
its
grunt
the
only
hint
of
the
engines
true
capacity
occurs
when
one
is
taking
off
from
rest
after
the
turbo
has
come
to
a
near
stop
with
the
extra
inertia
from
the
permanently
engaged
system
one
has
to
be
somewhat
delicate
in
feeding
in
the
clutch
to
prevent
an
embarassing
stall
alternately
one
could
use
more
revs
in
both
cases
a
very
small
price
to
pay
for
such
a
fantastic
engine
i
think
that
audi
of
america
should
offer
an
automatic
option
for
this
car
just
as
they
offer
though
in
extremely
small
numbers
a
speed
for
the
much
peakier
the
characteristics
of
the
engine
are
perfect
for
an
automatic
ironically
in
europe
a
slush
is
available
but
none
is
offered
for
the
land
of
the
slush
marketing
twits
rearing
their
ugly
heads
again
chassis
ive
noticed
that
audis
tend
to
have
very
wide
wheels
and
relatively
modest
tire
widths
the
car
comes
with
firestones
of
size
which
is
not
uncommon
at
all
however
the
very
attractive
spoke
wheels
are
no
less
than
inches
wide
so
there
is
no
sidewall
bulge
whatsoever
combined
with
the
flared
wheel
arches
the
has
a
mouth
watering
macho
yet
subdued
look
on
rough
concrete
it
becomes
immediately
clear
that
the
new
body
style
has
made
significant
advances
in
structural
rigidity
as
well
as
road
noise
suppression
i
suppose
the
two
are
interrelated
but
i
digress
to
use
a
cliche
the
body
feels
like
it
has
been
carved
out
of
stone
flex
is
totally
undetectable
even
when
going
over
rough
roads
with
a
super
rigid
body
like
this
stiff
springs
and
stiff
dampers
do
not
cause
excessive
harshness
and
while
the
ride
quality
will
never
worry
a
lexus
it
will
also
not
draw
comparisons
to
trucks
or
pony
cars
the
servotronic
steering
has
already
been
mentioned
i
consider
it
to
be
inoffensive
because
it
did
not
inhibit
spirited
cornering
i
was
able
to
test
the
cars
cornering
powers
without
too
much
trepidation
i
think
a
new
concept
is
at
work
in
this
car
with
its
fat
gumball
tires
talking
about
understeer
or
oversteer
is
practically
meaningless
on
a
banked
highway
on
ramp
i
went
in
slow
and
started
applying
power
as
i
went
around
i
could
feel
the
g
forces
build
to
the
point
where
the
skin
on
my
face
was
being
tugged
sideways
yet
the
car
was
totally
and
completely
obedient
to
throttle
and
steering
inputs
it
felt
that
the
limits
were
not
even
close
to
being
approached
the
g
forces
were
thrilling
but
the
entire
affair
of
going
around
a
curve
is
strangely
uninvolving
you
tell
the
car
what
you
want
and
it
does
it
end
of
story
i
think
that
i
am
starting
to
relate
more
and
more
to
those
reviewers
who
were
highly
impressed
by
the
honda
nsxs
clinical
efficiency
but
were
unable
to
fall
in
love
with
the
car
the
brakes
have
a
very
good
firmness
to
them
and
stop
the
car
pretty
well
too
though
ive
read
that
they
are
prone
to
fade
i
am
not
too
surprised
since
the
does
not
have
uprated
brakes
over
the
base
audi
fwd
harder
pads
would
help
but
that
in
turn
would
lead
to
a
more
wooden
response
when
cold
i
am
starting
to
see
a
trend
among
the
luxurysports
sedan
makers
where
extra
weight
is
not
being
offset
by
additional
braking
capacity
the
fade
performance
is
nothing
to
brag
about
neither
is
the
or
the
legends
brake
fade
these
days
seem
to
be
a
forgotten
virtue
when
everybodys
attention
is
focused
on
antilock
capability
comfort
for
a
car
with
such
sporty
abilities
its
comfort
levels
are
also
excellent
the
cabin
is
beautifully
appointed
with
carbonfiber
panel
inserts
in

of
the
wood
trim
of
the
all
the
expected

are

and
that
the
glaring
ommision
was
the
trip
computer
which
was
removed
because
audi
hasnt
gotten
it
to
work
reliably
yet
that
means
that
the
car
has
no
boost
gauge
a
real
disappointment
taking
into
account
how
much
the
turbo
dominates
its
performance
unusual
for
the
germans
the
comes
with
a
honda
style
moonroof
as
well
as
the
very
intelligent
dialasunroofposition
rotary
switch
noise
levels
including
engine
and
tire
noise
is
so
low
that
i
wouldnt
consider
the
lexus
advantage
in
this
area
to
be
significant
enough
to
sway
a
potential
buyer
conclusion
even
though
few
will
be
able
to
afford
an
audi
at
its
sticker
price
of
the
car
is
a
bargain
if
one
takes
into
account
what
it
has
to
offer
over
the
competition
the
valve
turbo
is
a
real
gem
even
if
it
doesnt
produce
ferrari
sounds
no
other
luxurysports
sedan
maker
offers
the
utter
security
of
quattro
all
wheel
drive
which
to
some
is
worth
the
extra

all
by

safety
features
are

side

standard
compliant
the
very
elegant

my
opinion
the
limited
tort
option
is
the
best
thing
casey
has
ever
done
basically
limited
tort
means
that
you
give
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffering
unless
one
of
the
following
conditions
is
met
your
medical
bills
resulting
from
the
accident
exceed
x
where
x
is
some
number
like
im
not
sure
of
the
exact
number
the
accident
was
caused
by
a
drunk
driver
i
mean
the
other
driver
was
drunk
you
get
a
good
lawyer
and
have
a
good
case
basically
you
can
appeal
to
regain
your
right
to
sue
but
theres
almost
no
chance
of
this
ever
happening
you
are
only
giving
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffering
you
can
still
sue
for
medical
costs
actual
damages
etc
by
agreeing
to
limited
tort
you
are
essentially
giving
up
your
right
to
be
an
asshole
who
treats
every
accident
as
an
entry
into
the
litigation
lottery
in
exchange
you
get
a
substantial
reduction
in
your
rates
i
save
unfortunately
the
insurance
companies
have
managed
to
scare
and
confuse
people
so
much
that
only
about
of
pennsylvanians
go
for
limited
tort
i
guess
thats
ok
if
more
people
opted
for
it
the
insurance
companies
would
be
pushing
harder
for
repeal
subject
re
what
car
is
this
the
bricklin
was
a
car
manufactured
by
a
company
started
by
malcolm
bricklin
who
i
believe
was
canadian
he
was
the
first
one
to
import
subarus
and
later
was
responsible
for
importing
yugos
i
believe
anyway
he
had
this
idea
that
what
would
really
sell
would
be
a
sports
car
but
one
incorporating
a
bunch
of
innovative
safety
features
the
bricklin
was
built
to
be
that
queerest
of
beasts
the
safety
sports
car
if
any
of
you
remember
the
early
movement
among
car
makers
to
design
experimental
safety
cars
you
will
recognize
the
general
appearance
of
the
bricklin
big
ol
bumpers
etc
anyone
recall
other
safety
features
the
engine
was
an
american
ford
i
think
is
right
personally
i
kinda
like
the
way
they
look
and
if
i
remember
from
the
old
magazine
articles
the
performance
was
only
halfbad
the
choice
of
colors
though
tended
towards
the

green

are

if

by

even
if
they
are

it
sounds
like
your
analysis
is
based
on
hypothesis
and
not
actually
using
the
id
like
to
give
some
feedback
based
on
real
life
experince
i
keep
the
in
advanced
logic
mode
and
it
rarely
lights
up
as
a
christmas
tree
the
only
time
it
does
is
when
i
am
in
the
middle
of
a
major
shopping
area
and
then
it
makes
sense
that
is
does
since
there
are
sources
coming
from
many
different
directions
i
have
found
the
to
be
consistent
in
its
reporting
of
bogeys
regardless
of
any
moving
cars
in
the
area
i
have
found
the
directional
indication
to
be
very
useful
in
one
case
there
was
two
radar
traps
set
up
within
one
mile
of
each
other
as
i
passed
the
first
radar
trap
the
direction
indication
changed
then
the
detector
was
set
off
again
pointing
in
the
forward
direction
with
other
radar
detectors
i
would
have
assumed
that
this
was
due
to
a
reflection
but
with
the
i
knew
there
was
a
high
probability
that
there
was
another
trap
and
there
was
on
other
occasions
the
directional
helped
discern
a
false
alarm
from
a
true
alarm
for
example
as
i
pass
a
source
the
direction
indicator
changes
the
directional
also
allows
me
to
focus
my
attention
as
to
where
the
signal
might
be
coming
from
instead
of
having
to
look
all
over
the
place
when
a
car
is
approaching
me
from
the
rear
with
a
detector
that
leaks
i
can
tell
that
the
signal
is
coming
from
the
rear
and
as
the
car
passes
me
i
can
verify
the
source
with
other
detectors
i
would
have
been
unable
to
do
this
and
would
have
had
to
assume
that
there
was
a
radar
trap
when
there
was

the

i
took
it

they
checked
the

it
was

they
checked
the

it
was
ok
i
had
the
exact
problem
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
again
last
week
the
dealer
says
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
because
mitsubishi
the
says
they
have
never
heard
of
the
problem
and
the
dealer
could
not
reproduce
the
problem
while
they
had
the
car
in
all
three
occurances
the
car
was
parked
head
first
in
a
garage
and
since
the
front
wheels
were
stuck
the
car
could
not
be
towed
to
the
dealer
before
releasing
the
shifter
hence
temporarily
solving
the
problem
and
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
refused
to
send
someone
to
check
the
car
while
it
was
stuck
i
know
there
is
smething
wrong
with
the
transmission
shifting
from
to
and
getting
stuck
at
random
but
i
cant
get
the
dealer
to
fix
it
i
need
your
help
with
the
mechanical
problems
and
with
how
to
handle

all

they

is
there
anything

id
assume
easier
since
were
removing

instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
this
really
bugs
me
the
emissions
of
diesels
are
the
cleanest
of
any
vechicle
but
they
are
considered
so
polluting
that
they
are
banned
in
passenger

in
california
what
a
bunch
of
crap
diesel
is
the
fuel
of
choice
for
enviromental
benefit
in
europe
while
here
its
illegal
for
the
same
reason
the
particulates
are
nothing
but
carbon
they
are
just
an
annoyance
at
worst
nothing
beats
the
diesel
cycle
for
efficiency
and
emissions
torque
or
engine
durability
its
also
cheaper
just
to
clear
things
up
as
to
why
i
posted
the
question
that
way
i
was
debating
with
a
coworker
about
diesels
i
claimed
they
were
cleanerburning
than
gas
engines
he
said
the
extra
junk
put
out
by
them
was
offset
by
the
savings
in
greenhouse
gasses
i
made
all
the
same
claims
you
did
but
one
question
of
his
was
what
about
the
carbon
i
said
it
was
harmless
but
he
wanted
to
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
i
suggested
scrubbers
i
figured
it
would
be
no
harder
or
more
expensive
to
install
than
cats
does
there
exist
any
designs
for

to

question
i
convinced
him
that
diesels
are

otherwise

i
named

the
opel
gt
sold
in
this
country
from

it
originally
had
a

engine
which
was
later
replaced
by
the

it
was

on
the
old
kadett
drive
train
and
suspension
with
leaf
springs
in
the
rear
and
a

transverse
leaf
spring
in

it
looked
good

was
limited
as
a

has
also
been
some
discussion
in

about
the

and
other
models
in
opel
introduced
a
new
line
of
models
the
series
that
were
also
known
as
model
numbers
etc
these
cars
had
the
newer
engine
and
were
available
as
two
and
fourdoor
coupes
a
station
wagon
and
a
sport
coupe
known
in
europe
as
the
manta
at
the
same
time
there
were
two
cars
which
sold
very
few
numbers
that
also
had
the
engine
but
the
kadett
suspension
the
sport
coupe
model
was
also
available
as
the
rallye
with
a
blacked
out
hood
tach
and
fog
lights
but
was
mechanically
the
same
except
for
a
numerically
higher
rear
end
ratio
in
the
sport
coupe
was
also
named
the
manta
in
the
us
was
the
last
year
for
the
gt
in
any
country
both
because
of
the
us
bumper
height
regulations
and
the
fact
that
fiat
exercised
an
option
on
the
factory
that
opel
was
leasing
to
build
the
gts
the
series
continued
in
with
minor
body
differences
in
the
manta
sedan
also
called
the
ascona
and
the
wagon
were
available
with
bosch
electronic
fuel
injection
these
cars
also
had
larger
brakes
and
wider
wheels
these
cars
were
starting
to
compete
with
the
buick
century
low
price
leader
of
the
time
and
were
the
last
opels
imported
into
the
us
from
to
cars
that
sported
buickopel
badges
were
still
sold
by
the
buick
dealers
but
were
rebadged
isuzu

the
idea
was
to
call
them
opels
instead
of
changing

more

test
drove

cse
last

here
are
my
impressions
awesome
power
especially
over
when
the
turbo
really
comes
on
if
you
get
on
the
power
really
hard
in
a
tight
corner
the
frontwheel
drive
causes
it
to
understeer
heavily
and
then
viciously
hook
into
the
corner
not
a
desirable
handling
trait
but
common
in
powerful
front
drive
cars
the
cse
is
mercedes
is
reardrive
so
it
does
not
have
this
problem
huge
interior
and
cargo
space

most
rubbery
shifter
i
have

i
drove
a
it
was
absolutely
numb
you
might
be
able
to
get
used

it
i
dont
know
i
also
didnt
like
its
location
which
was
too
far
down
and
too
far
right
from
the
shifters
position
i
got
the
impression
that
saab
really
designed
the
car
for
an
automatic
it
was
rather
noisy

buzz
rattles

creaks

almost
certainly
better
off
selling
it
yourself
if
you
dont
mind
that
extra
hassle
having
a
tradein
on

just

a
dealership
more
confusing
i
know
that
the
blue

value

car
is
i
assume
this
is
retail
bluebook
there
are
two
bluebook
prices
one
for
retail
and
one
for
wholesale
you
really
want
the
retail
price
if
you
can
get
it
the
blue
books
also
have
adjustments
you
can
make
for
low
mileage
and
extras
on
your
particular
car
you
should
look
all
this
stuff
up
yourself
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
blue
book
prices
are
averages
over
the
country
that
may
not
apply
in
your
area
for
example
blue
book
prices
are
low
for
california
a
better
way
of
finding
out
how
much
your
car
might
be
worth
is
to
call
around
and
see
what
its
selling
for
if
any
used
lots
have
one
or
looking
in
local
papers
for

it

what
does
this

the

the

autos
of

also
have
to

rolling
resistance
since
drag
opposes
the

the
engine
must
make
up
for
that
by
burning
more
fuel
anyway
since
the

the

q

based
on
my
experience
with
a
the
hardtop
jeepstyle
model
i
would
definitely
give
a
new
model
consideration
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
models
are
very
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
its
mind
i
would
assume
until
proven
otherwise
that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
the
new
cruisers
do
not
have
independent
suspension
in
the
front
they
still
run
a
straight
axle
but
with
coils
the
is
the
one
with
independent
front
the
cruisers
have
incredible
wheel
travel
with
this
system
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
cruiser
does
have
full
time
but
the
center
diff
locks
in
low
range
my
brother
has
a
and
is
an
incredibly
sturdy

has
done
all
the

without

no

the

also
claims
theres

i

was
the

i
dint
notice
it
being
any
worse
in

weather
perhaps
because
its
always
humid
around

i
was
told
by

that
it
has
to
do
with
changing

began

someone
could
make
some
good
money
selling
the

my
feeling
is
that
since
many
other

makers
do
not
have
this
problem
that
its
a
poor
design
or
engineering
problem

one
cool
price
too
as
i
heard
at
any
rate
the
point
is
im
pretty
sure
there
is
indeed
one
in
production
tho
rather
limited
this
is
no
bugatti
its
labeled
a
bugatti
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
bugattis
of
yore
from
what
i
understand
just
some
ppl
wanting
to
build
a
silly
supercar
and
use
that
name
to
sell
it
drew
may
be
thinking
of
the
cizeta
morodor
but
that
hasnt
reached
production
at
least
not
yet
as
for
the
bugatti
well
i
have
to
agree
with
matt
it
aint
the
top
dog
it
aint
sexy
and
sveltlooking
and
it
aint
a
real
bugatti
in
fact
it
looks
like
its
in
tight
competition
with
the
consulier
for
the
most
buttugly
car
of
the
decade
award
it
isnt
that
bad
at
least
the
bugatti
has
compound
curves
compared
to
the
slab
sides
on
the
consulier
and
the
bugatti
has
a
quad
turbo
thing
of
it
as
three
cylinder
turbo
engines
tied
together
also
ettore
bugattis
nephew
is
on
the
board
of
directors
and
had
a
hand
in
the
development
so
thats
about
as
much
bugatti
as
you
are
likely
to
get
in
todays
world
much
like

there
anything

how

would
it

assume
easier

instead
of

lets
hear
peoples

vw

mercedes
have
tinkered
with

also
vw
uses
a
kind
of
turbocharger
on

that
helps
reduce
particulates
as
well

i
dont

the

are

being

gary

says
could
someone
explain
how
to
make
sense
of

coefficients
ie
cd
mentioned
in
magazines
i
understand
that
lower
numbers
signify
better
aerodynamics
but
what
does
this
mean
in
the
real
world
is
there
a
way
to
calculate
new
top
speedsassuming
the
car
is
not
rev
limited
at
top
speed
or
mileage
benefits
if
a
identical
car
had
the
cd
reduced
from
to
its
pretty
complex
and
cd
isnt
the
whole
story
either
cd
for
cars
is
usually
calculated
based
on
the
frontal
area
of
the
car
so
a
large
car
with
a
good
cd
could
get
the
same
drag
force
as
a
smaller
car
with
a
poorer
cd
to
calculate
drag
use
this
formula
d
rho
cd
s
where
d
is
the
drag
force
lbs
rho
is
the
local
air
density
v
is
the
velocity
fts
and
s
is
the
frontal
area
note
that
the
pieces
called
rho
are
sometimes
called
qbar
or
dynamic
pressure
a
fancy
aero
term
for
air
pressure
or
force
note
that
power
is
p
f
v
where
p
is
power
lbffts
f
is
the
force
drag
in
this
case
lbf
and
v
is
velocity
fts
note
that
if
you
put
the
whole
equation
into
one
by
substituting
d
for
force
you
get
a
velocity
cubed
term
thats
why
huge
increases
in
power
result
in
little
increases
in
speed
ditto
for
decreases
in
cd
so
if
you
have
a

car
and
reduce

the

anyone

talking

just
a
query
do
you
drive
your

very
very
carefully
like
no
sudden
acceleration
etc
if
yeah
then
the
m
oil
change
seems
quite
reasonable
but
if
you
drive
kinda
fast
id
get
a
bit
up
tight
abot
that
thingy
a
point
to
note
just
because
the

at
doesnt
mean
all
the
others
will
come
on
every
too
shaz
shaz
hmm
but
the

that
i
have
works
this
way
there
are
yellow
red

initially
all
green
indicators
will
be
on
for
few
minutes
when
you
start
your

the
computer
will
actually
sense
how
you
drive
your
car
and
as
time
goes
by
the
green
indicators
will
start
to
go
off
one
by
one
and
then
the
yellow
indicator
will
turn
on
and
then
the
red
indicator
will
go
on
and
you
should
get
service
when
by
the
time
green
indicators
are
off
after
service
the
mechanicor
you
will
reset
the
service
indicators
and
the
computer
starts
counting
again
so
i
expect
to
have
a
toolor
a
procedure
to
reset
it
so
the
green
lights
will
come
on
and
the
yellow
and
red
lights
will
go
off

how
people
can
do

change
themself
without
knowing
how
to

the

its
the
first
european

i
have

changing

at
miles
is
a
surprise
to
me
and
its
a
big
plus
but
i
wonder
how
that
could
happen
since
the
oil
lose
its
lubrication
ability
over
time
i
thought
its
the
oil
and
not
the

there
are
a

i
dont

the

they
are
uncomfortable
as

im
going

store
those
and
find
a

to
drive
in
i
have
all

im
looking

a

type
seat
i
can
modify
the
brackets

cushion
height
and

width
are

re

you
know
im
a
ford
fan
i
must
say
so
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
mustang
i
have
faith
that
it
will
be
a
fine
product
more
desireable
than
the
camaro
is
now
you
know
thats
mho
truethats
your
opinion
they
beat
ford
to
the
market
with
the
camarofirebird
but
really
only
in
words
production
of
these
vehicles
will
be
limited
until
the
end
of
the
year
keeping
selling
prices
above
msrp
for
the
most
part
since
there
are
so
many
twitching
camaro
fans
out
there
i
wouldnt
press
ford
to
hurry
the
mustang
since
the
final
wait
could
be
worth
it
besides
no
bowtie
fanatic
is
gonna
buy
the
mustang
anyway
true
again
i
wouldnt
take
a
free
mustanghonest
the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
fyi
they
already
did
too
bad
that
the
current
mustang
cant
even
compete
with
the
new
camaro
without
using
an
active
imagination
right
now
few
cars
can
compare
with
the
camaro
think
about
it
for
a
car
that
will
out
perform
all
but
a
few
exotics
if
you
are

swearing
at
me
look

are

is
there
anything

how

lets
hear
peoples
opinions
vw

have
tinkered
with

also
vw
uses
a
kind
of

on

helps
reduce
particulates

its
a

gm
had

erik
i
sure
dont
know
what
and
how
they
measure
in

to
diesel
motors
in
cars
trucks
and
busses
but
i
think
they
are
probably
measuring
the
wrong
pollutants
or
at
the
wrong
time
or
both
i
certainly
find
it
offensive
to
drive
behind
a
diesel
bus
or
diesel
truck
and
some

they
stink

ronald

garnett
writes
hello
auto
enthusiasts
i
recently
had
more
car
mangled
broken
into
and
decided
to
get
an
alarm
installed
its
a
viper
and
has
a
shock
sensor
sensors
for
each
door
ignition
cutoff
and
automatic
door
locks
i
have
this
same
alarm
installed
in
my
syclone
it
works
great
the
shock
sensor
is
very
sensitive
but
much
more
practical
than
the
motion
sensor
i
have
on
my
other
car
it
doesnt
trigger
if
the
car
is
rocked
gently
by
the
wind
but
any
kind
of
shock
sets
it
off
even
kicking
the
tire
sets
it
off
it
works
great
what
worries
me
is
the
hood
and
hatch
if
someone
could
pry
them
up
gently
enough
then
they
could
bypass
the
alarm
the
shock
sensor
is
adjustable
and
there
are
two
cycles
on
it
you
can
adjust
it
to
be
sensitive
enough
that
there
is
no
way
you
could
open
the
hood
without
setting
off
the
alarm
although
i
know
that
you
cannot
pop
the
hood
on
the
syclone
without
setting
off
my
alarm
now
and
yet
i
have
had
zero
none
false
alarms
with
this
system
the
alarm
tells
you
when
you
disarm
it
whether
it
has
been
activated
in
your
absence
i
have
been
able
to
trace
every
alarm
to
its
cause
and
it
was
not
a
false
alarm
im
also
wondering
how
easy
it
would
be
for
a
thief
to
crawl
underneath
the
car
and
cut
the
battery
cable
to
disable
the
alarm
i
guess
it
would
be
possible
depending
on
the
vehicle
my
syclone
is
so
tight
in
the
engine
compartment
that
it
would
be
tough
to
do
this
there
are
supplemental
power
supplies
you
can
put
on
with
this
viper
alarm
but
i
dont
have
one
i
really
think
that
if
someone
wants
my
car
that
bad
the
alarm
wont
keep
them
from
it
even
with
a
supplemental
power
supply
viper
also
sells
some
fancy
field
disturbance
sensor
that
supposedly
detects
people
approcahing
the
car
this
is
primarily
for
convertibles
i
have
a
convertible
and
have
looked
at
this
feature
in
detail
alpine
actually
makes
a
better
radar
unit
if
you
want
to
get
one
of
these
it
has
zones
in
it
that
can
be
shut
down
independently
so
that
if
one
side
of
your
car
has
pedestrian
traffic
or
something
else
that
would
trigger
an
alarm
it
shuts
down
the
zone
or
rather
pulls
it
in
tighter
i
dont
see
the
real
benefit
to
these
unless
you
have
a
convertible
that
you
leave
the
top
down
on
avoid
the
voice
alarm
that
can
be
added
to
the
radar
package
it
talks
to
people
as
they
walk
by
i
saw
one
installed
on
a
lotus
esprit
the
kids
would
taunt
it
seeing
how
close
they
could
get
before
it
warned
them
to
get
back
the
owner
finally
disabled
it
which
defeats
the
purpose
in
my
mind
im
interested
in
the
opinions
of
you
netters
about
these
problems
and
about
the
viper
in
general
i
am
real
happy
with
my
viper
one
other
feature
i
really
like
is
you
can
tune
it
to
your
preferences
you
can
have
it
arm
passively
or
not
you
can
disable
the
chirp
for
armingdisarming
you
can
have
it
lockunlock
the
doors
when
the
alarm
is
armeddisarmed
i
like
these
features
i
hate
the
chirp
when
the
alarm
armsdisarms
so
mine
flashes
the
lights
only
i
like
the
door
lock
feature
although
i
have
to
be
careful
to
take
my
keys
with
me
because
it
doesnt
know
if
you
have
left
your
keys
in
the
car
when
it
passively
arms
and
locks
the
doors
but
if
you
are
meticulous
about
taking
your
keys
with
you
it
takes
care
of
the
rest
the
car
is
an
ford
probe
gt
that
used
to
be
in
great
shape
ron
garnett
i
looked
seriously
at
the
alpine
system
too
it
is
a
real
nice
system
but
more
money
and
it
has
a
motion
sensor
standard
instead
of
the
shock
sensor
the
shock
sensor
is
betterand
the
viper
shock
sensor
is
better
cycle
than
the
optional
alpine
one
imho
i
think
the
viper
gives
you
a
lot
of
good
value
for
the
money
but
it
isnt
absolutely
tamperproof
no
system
is

maybe

one

people
are
very
concerned

it
taking
a
few
more

this
along
with
narrow
old

also
results
in
smaller

with
smaller

these
engines
usually
dont
have
the
torque
to
mesh
well
with
an
automatic
so
having
engines
that
dont
work
well
with

a

concern

that
not
many
big

come
with
manuals
if
youve

youve
got
the
money
for
the
gas
and
the
engine
to
drive
through
the
slushbox
as
automatics
become
more
efficient
the
bigotry
is
probably
reduced
still
everyone
knows
how
to
drive
a
manual
and
cars
are
cheaper
with
one
and
it
saves
a
little
expensive

there
arent

none

is
what
i

talking

shafts

which

i

didnt
you
also

that
it
was
easier

add

to

its

both

the

because
subaru
does
that
has
nothing
to
do
with

i
think
subaru
somehow
connecting
themselves

is
an
absurdity

im
not

fan
big

dings
these
configurations
overhead

etc
etc
have
been
around
for
nearly
years
the
point
that
they
are
trying
to
make
is
that
while
everybody
settles
for
the
orthodox
inline
they
are
using
a
horizontally
opposed
which
is
unique
in
that
market
segment
and
porsche
also
uses
a
flat
six
in
their
so
whats
the
problem
i
dont
see
any
claim
that
their
engine
is
as
good
as
a

they
are
simply
pointing
out
that
they
use
the
same
configuration
as
a

you
want

nitpick

see
my

that
describes
the

i
went
to
bbb

they
ruled
that
chevrolet
must
buy
it
back
from
me
if
you
do
get

stay
away
from
the

the

they
have
put

so
far
after
about

overdrive
either
starts
rattling

there
is

chevrolet
says

if
you

the
rpm
drop

and
you
begin

loose
speed
i
should
point
out
that
the
they
put
in
the
hd
gvw
trucks
is
a
detuned
motor
compared
to
the
one
they
put
in
the
light
duty
ones
they
dropped
the
compression
ratio
supposedly
for
engine
longevity
reasons
so
the
light

may
pull
better
than
my

does
other
things
that

include

had

from

with

i

i
think
its
important
to
differentiate
your
experience
from
a
typical
accident
hail
damage
is
clearly
not
the
fault
of
the
owner
and
also
tends
to
be
well
publicized
in
the

so
its
to
the
ins
cos
benefit
to
respond

helpfully
damage

doesnt
imply
anything
about
the
likelihood
of
future
claims
unless
you
live

that
gets
frequent

theres
no

them

there
is
a
tool
available
to
reset
the
service
indicator
on
bmws
but
the
lights
will
come
back
on
after
weeks
the
tool
is
in
fact
illegal
in
europe
atleast
it
is
often
the
case
that
the
unsuspecting
punter
trots
off
to
buy
a
used
bmw
and
a
few
weeks
later
all
the
lights
come
on
other
than
that
i
know
of
no
other
tool
anyone
else
shaz
hmm
but
the
service
indicators
that
i
have
works
this
way
there
are
yellow
red
indicators
initially
all
green
indicators
will
be
on
for
few
minutes
when
you
start
your
car
the
computer
will
actually
sense
how
you
drive
your
car
and
as
time
goes
by
the
green
indicators
will
start
to
go
off
one
by
one
and
then
the
yellow
indicator
will
turn
on
and
then
the
red
indicator
will
go
on
and
you
should
get
service
when
by
the
time
green
indicators
are
off
after
service
the
mechanicor
you
will
reset
the
service
indicators
and
the
computer
starts
counting
again
so
i
expect
to
have
a
toolor
a
procedure
to
reset
it
so
the
green
lights
will
come
on
and
the
yellow
and
red
lights
will
go
off
i
wonder
how
people
can
do
oil
change
themself
without
knowing
how
to
reset
the
indicator
its
the
first
european
car
i
have
and
changing
oil
at
miles
is
a
surprise
to
me
and
its
a
big
plus
but
i
wonder
how
that
could
happen
since
the
oil
lose
its
lubrication
ability
over
time
i
thought
its
the
oil
and
not
the
vehicle
that
determines
how
often
we
should
change
oil
any
bmw
owner
on
the
net
response
welcomed
ps
my
initial
question
is
how
do
you
seset
the
service
indicator
of
a
bmw
derek
there
is
a
perfectly
legal
tool
available
to
reset
the
bimmer
service
lights
it
will
cost
you
from
a
mailorder
and
buying
one
far
outweighs
the
possible
consequences
of
destroying
all
the
electronics
if
you
try
di
it
yourself
you
wonder
how
people
do
an
oil
change
without
knowing
how
it
reset
why
is
reseting
so
important
the
only
reason
for
doing
it
is
stop
the
annoyance
of
a
red
light
staring
at
you
forget
this
in
european
cars
you
only
need
to
change
the
oil
every
crap
anyone
serious
about
keeping
their
engine
in
good
shape
and
extending
its
life
will
change
it
every
inc
filter
dont
wait
for
the
servive
lights
to
come
on
before
servicing
the
car
i
bought
a
bmw
about
months
ago
it
had
green
lights
on
i
have
changed
the
oil
every
completly
flushed
brake
fliud
changed
all
filtersoil
air
and
fuel
changed
transmission
and
drive
oils
and
done
almost
all
of
the
other
things
req
for
service
and
a
service
after
nearly
miles
i
am
still
on
green
lights
after
a
winter
in
burlington
and
it
is
snowing

that
is
not

how

question
whats
your
experience
with
car
wash
wax
this
is
the
liquid
type
of
wax
in
bottles
that
you
pour
it
in
water
sponge
it
on
you
car
hose
it
off
and
dry
it
with
cloth
many
people
have
used
it
it
is
very
easy
to
work
with
and
gives
seeminly
the
same
visual
results
as
that
of
paste
type
of
wax
but
does
it
last
long
does
it
have
any
negative
effects
to
car
paint
can
you

some

otherwise
it

interestingly
their
lack
of

and
lack
of
a
grille
was
a
big
design
statement
they
tried
to
defy
conventional
wisdom
and
carve
their

unfortunately
sales
were
only
half
those
of
the

and
hence
they

weight
some
of

i

recommend

at

under

conditions
ive

ive
never

except
when
having
a

job
which
is
usually
at

miles
alot

this

preventative
maintenance
on

also
there
are
brake
system
flushing
agents
that
can
be
used
but
the
problem
is
that
if
any
of
the
agent
is
left
in
the
system
it
can
cause
problems
so
its
been
recommended
not
to
use
them
unless
you
are
certain
that
you
can
remove
all
of
the
flushing
agent
just
for
your
info
i
was
quoted
a
price
of
and
for
flushing
the

this
in

how

clevel
vibration

results
uneven

turning
the

will
remedy
this

check

dont

it

would

that

it
might
be
a

how
about
the
for
suspension
well
i
wouldnt

likes

no
biggie
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
its
definitely
not
a
family
car
true
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
ive
had
this
problem
and
read
about
it
or
at
least
i
assume
the
one
i
had
was
the
one
i
read
about
in
any
case
what
happened
was
the
weld
between
the
muffler
and
the
pipe
feeding
it
ok
so
im
not
a
mechanic
broke
in
my
case
the
dealer
welded
it
ordered
replacement
parts
and
put
them
on
when
they
got
them
i
suspect
this
is
some
sort
of
design
flaw
or
production
flaw
in
any
case
i
have
an
earlier
model
and
would
expect
it
to
be
worked
out
on
newer
ones
in
any
case
it
is
a
warrantee
repair
or
they
get
the
keys
back
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
i
have
to
agree
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
seriously
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
very
well
i
second
this
there
seems
to
be
some
things
that
slipped
through
but
the
car
seems
very
sound

not
perfection

let
me
explain
why
i
feel
the
bogey
counter
feature
is
a
gimmick
radar
waves
bounce
off
objects
especially
metal
that
is
how
radar
speed
measurement
works
a
high
frequency
microwave
x
band
approx
ghz
and
k
is
approx
ghz
is
sent
out
and
reflected
back
to
the
antenna
off
of
an
automobile
or
other
objects
if
an
object
is
moving
a
doppler
shift
about
hz
per
mph
on
x
band
occurs
is
measured
and
converted
to
miles
per
hour
these
waves
bounce
all
over
the
place
and
they
can
reflect
many
times
and
go
in
many
directions
from
what
i
understand
the
can
only
tell
if
these
microwaves
are
coming
from
the
front
rear
or
both
there
are
only
two
antennas
if
they
are
coming
from
both
this
in
interpreted
as
a
side
bogey
bogey
counts
are
determined
as
sources
by
their
relative
strength
to
one
another
even
if
they
are
reflections
of
the
same
source
im
certainly
no
engineer
and
really
have
no
scientific
basis
on
which
to
make
this
argument
but
dont
you
answer
your
own
question
is
the
reflected
signal
shifted
at
all
from
the
act
of
being
reflected
if
so
wouldnt
it
then
be
easy
for
the
detector
to
discriminate
between
reflections
and
direct
sources
here
is
the
problem
since
the
microwaves
reflect
how
does
the
unit
tell
if
it
is
a
source
or
a
reflection
take
a
and
drive
to
the
local
grocery
store
that
uses
an
xband
radar
door
opener
you
can
tell
by
the
small
black
box
above
the
door
pointed
down
at
about
a
degree
angle
and
your
detector
going
off
when
it
gets
near
the
will
count
or
bogeys
from
all
directions
front
rear
and
sides
it
doesnt
say
which
side
the
count
changes
as
cars
drive
by
and
reflections
change
is
there
or
sources
not
at
the
store
i
go
to
as
i
drive
around
with
a
standard
detector
i
can
only
find
one
source
and
that
is
the
door
opener
for
the
front
door

their

on

calls
free

it
seems
that
there
are
more
and
more
bands
available
for
police
radar
each

i
have
recently
purchased
within
the
last
months
the
bel
while
it
is
not
a
perfect
detector
by
any
means
it
does
do
the
job
fairly
well
now
however
i
pick
up
a
car
magazine
at
the
airport
and
read
about
this
super
ka
wideband
which
is
a
superset
of
the
ka
wideband
that
this
latest
generation
of
detectors
was
touted
as
covering

now
bel
has
a
new
series
of

out
that
cover
all
the
usual
bands
x
k
ka
photo
ka
wideband
as
well
as

just
as
there
comes
a

diminishing
returns
when
chasing
increased
pc
computing
power
with
faster
and
faster
cpus
for
the
average
home
consumer
at
least
it
seems
that
there
is
now
the
same
concern
with
radar
detectors
does
it
make
sense
to
upgrade
just
months
after
purchasing
my
new
detector
is
valentine
upgrading
their
equipment
if
so
it
might
be
worth
it
for
me
to
upgrade
to
the
valentine
i
was
in
the
market
for
a
valentine
when
i
purchased
the
bel
but
the
month
waiting
time
was
just
too
much
for
me
since
i
had
inadequate
protection
with
my
passport
life
was
much
simpler
when
there
was
just
x
and
k
band
and
escort
has
the
best
equipment
on
the
market
and
there
was
no
need
to
continuously
shop
for
a
new
detector
i
hope
that
the
flood
of
new
radar
bands
ceases
with
this
new
super

the

i

how
often
you
see

he
also

although
i
could

he
wouldnt

me
check
the

by
taking
it

a
garage
suspicious
and
who
knows
what
milage
is

let

know
what
to

theres

mikes
dont

it
all

you

will
just

you
headaches
later

it
sounds
like
the
car
needs
a
lot
of
work
and
as
you
probably
know
bmws
are
not
cheap
to
fix
either
the
owner
sounds
like
a
shady
character
just
trying
to
take
advantage
of
someone
sure
sounds
good
but
you
should
calculate
how
much
the
repairs
will
be
it
sounds
like
you
would
have
to
sink
in
at
least
to
get
everything
fixed
if
not
more
also
never
trust
anyone
as
far
as
mileage
is
concerned
who
knows
how
many
miles
are
on
it
and
how
it
was
driven
sure
people
tell
you
bmws
hold
up
but
you
have
to
consider
any
car
is
subject
to
wear
and
tear
for
all
you
know
it
could
have
miles
on
it
the
thing
you
have
to
remember
is
that
this
isnt
the
last
around
either
just
wait
and
keep
shopping
for
around
you
can
probably
find
one
that
is
better
needs
less
repair
and
has
legitimate
mileage
unlike
the
one
you

this

the

which
from

uses
the

has

i
cant
speak
for
the

but
i
think
it
does
too
also
stop
and
think
about
the
markets
here
the
mustang
is
and
always
has
been
a
massmarket
sporty
car
thats
where
the
pony
car
class
came
from
with
a
performance
model
thats
why
it
has
the
econobox
running
gear
that
was
also
factored
into
the
design
of
the
mustang
from
the
day
lee
iacocca
conceived
his
baby
it
was
designed
as
a
widemarket
carsporty
yet
accessiblewith
room
for
performance
tweaking
the
cars
you
listed
are
designed
for
a
specific
market
niche
and
they
both
fit
those
niches
very
well
the
mustang
at
least
does
well
in
multiple
markets
i
cant
speak
for
the

i
thought
that

originally
designed
for
a
truck
not
necessarily
a

and
then
just
sort
of
dropped
into
the
vipers
frame
because
it
fit
and
was
available
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
saw
and
heard
a
viper
and
my
friends
first
response
was
that
it
sounded
like
a
truck
it
sounded
fine
to
me
but
then
again
i
dont
like
the
whiny
noise
that
most
modern
sports
car
engines
make
btw
the
viper
we
saw
was
moving
at
about
just
like
all
of
the
other
cars
on
the
freeway
heading
east
out
of
la
on
a
friday
afternoon
looked
really
nice
though
actually
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
in
the
viper
was
not
the
that
dodge
was
developing
for
its
new
kenworths
i
have
always
thought
it
was
the
exhaust
system
and
not
the
engine
that
produced
the
noise
of
a
car
well
yes
the
exhaust
is
where
the
majority
of
the
noise
comes
out
but
the
basics
tone
firing
cadence
etc
are
determined
by
the
engine
configuration
in
the
case
of
the
viper
yes
we
are
discussing
a
huge
multicylinder
engine
which
will
sound
somewhat
like
a
truck
and
my
understanding
btw
is
that
that
engine
was
designed
originally
with
the
intention
of
being
ad
aptible
for
either
the
trucks
or
the
viper
and
from
what
ive
heard
no
first
hand
knowledge
its
doing
a
pretty
good
job
at
both
and
the
best
exhaust
sound
in
the
world
is
now
and
will
always
be

the
part
about
spending
on
repairs
reminds
me
of
an
article
i
read
in
a
magazine
comparing
the
year
ownership
costs
of
a
toyota
camry
and
a
ford
taurus
or
something
like
that
the
result
which
they
announced
with
great
flourish
was
that
it
cost
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
period
that
was
their
argument
to
prove
that
you
dont
go
wrong
buying
the
ford
taurus
over
the
camry
now
if
i
remember
correctly
the
camry
costs
about
or
so
more
in
initial
costs
essentially
it
means
that
you
spend
about
extra
on
repairs
on
the
taurus
that
is
ridiculous
every
time
your
car
needs
repairs
it
is
extra
hassles
loss
of
time
and
a
dozen
other
things
i
would
much
rather
spend
more
in
initial
costs
than
spend
more
in
repair
costs
did
you
account
for
depreciation
i
seriously
doubt
that
a
taurus
would
rack
up
an
extra
in
repair
costs
over
years

to
be

many

are
worth

more

the

inferior

i
have
a
feeling
that
the
amount
the
government
steals
from
an
honest
productive
citizen
to
breed
this
trash
is
significantly
less
than
the
value
of
many
automobiles

for

who
will
argue
that
the
animals
out

stealing
cars

everything
else
not

committing
completely
senseless
acts

such

they
did

my
full
opinion

subject
rather
than
just
reply
to
others
points
the
biggest
problem
some
people
seem
to
be
having
is
that
saturn
dealers
make
on
a
car
i
think
most
will
agree
with
me
that
the
car
is
comparably
priced
with
its
competitors
that
is
they
arent
overpriced
compared
to
most
cars
in
their
class
i
dont
understand
the
point
of
arguing
over
whether
the
dealer
makes
the
or
not
i
have
never
understood
what
the
big
deal
over
dealer
profits
is
either
the
only
thing
that
i
can
figure
out
is
that
people
believe
that
if
they
minimize
the
dealer
profit
they
will
minimize
their
total
outofpocket
expenses
for
the
car
while
this
may
be
true
in
some
cases
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
generally
true
i
bought
a
saturn
sl
in
january
of
at
that
time
based
on
studying
car
prices
i
decided
that
there
was
no
comparable
car
that
was
priced
as
cheaply
as
the
saturn
sure
maybe
i
could
have
talked
the
price
for
some
other
car
to
the
saturn
price
but
my
outofpocket
expenses
wouldnt
have
been
any
different
whats
important
to
me
is
how
much
money
i
have
left
after
i
buy
the
car
reducing
dealer
profit
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saving
money
show
me
how
reducing
dealer
profit
saves
me
money
and
ill
believe
that
its
important
my
experience
has
been
that
reducing
dealer
profit
does
not
necessarily
save
me
money
fred
say
you
bought
your
saturn
at
with
a
dealer
profit
of
if
the
dealer
profit
is
then
you
would
only
be
paying
for
the
same
car
so
isnt
that
saving
money
moreover
if
saturn
really
does
reduce
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
cars
will
be
even
better
deals
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
was
already
below
market
average
for
the
class
of
cars
then
after
they
reduce
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
average
it
will
attract
even
more
people
to
buy
saturns
because
it
would
save
them
money
force
the
competitors
to
lower
their
prices
to
survive
now
not
only
will
saturn
owners
benefit
from
a
lower
dealer
profit
even
the
buyers
for
other
cars
will
pay
less

its
great
that
all

can
outhandle

and
out
accelerate
an

but
youve
got
to
ask
yourself
one
question
do
all
these
other
cars
have
a
moonroof
with
a
sliding
sunshade
no
wimpy
popup
sunroofs
or
power
sliding
roofs
that
are
opaque
a
moonroof
that
can
be
opened
to
the
air
closed
to
let
just
light
in
or
shaded
so

wrong
why
dont
you
look
again
at
motor
trends
slalom
times
they
are
right
along
with
the
integra
and
the
car
does
that
with
small
inch
tires
that
are
all
weather
not
to
mention
that
the
integra
rides
alot
better
than
a
beretta
your
acceleartion
times
also
vary
magazine
to
magazine
road
track
and
car
driver
have
the
gsr
at
to
for
road
and
track
also
quarter
mile
times
vary
from
to
you
cant
tell
exactly
by
the
numbers
furthermore
the
integra
will
definately
outrun
the
beretta
on
the
high
end
car
driver
and
road
track
have
the
gsr
doing
to
mph
and
it
gets
there
fast
so
the
beretta
can
out
handle
the
integra
and
it
can
certainly
keep
up
with
it
in
acceleration
and
the
beretta
probably
has
a
higher
top
speed
due
to
the
horsepower
advantage
hptorque
for
the
integra
vs
for
the
beretta
you
always
believe
those
exact
numbers
why
dont
you
drive
a
gsr
and
see
for
your
self
while
the
gsr
has
a
low
torqye
its
high
gearing
over
a
rpm
make
up
for
the
difference
still
wouldnt
call
it
a
torque
moster
though
the
biggest
advantage
would
have
to
be
the
price
the
integra
costs
as
tested
motor
trend
the
gtz
costs
as
tested
the
gtz
also
has
standard
nicities
and
airbag
and
antilock
brakes
an
airbag
is
not
available
on
the
integra
and
lower
models
do
not
have
abs
considering
you
save
almost
dollars
for
the
beretta
and
the
is
a
reliable
engine
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
get
the
integra
as
a
performance
coupe
which
is
what
people
have
been
trying
to
make
it
out
to
be
quad
reliable
yeah
whats
your
definition
of
reliable
if
thats
reliable
then
its
safe
to
say
that
integra
engines
in
general
are
near
perfect
not
to
mention
a
hell
of
alot
smoother
and
quieter
balance
shaftsthe
acura
has
the
engine
wins
the
reliablity
contest
hands
down
you
can
rev
that
car
all
day
everyday
and
youll
never
blow
a
hose
or
crack
the
block
or
anything
else
i
speak
from
expierence
im
not
saying
the
quad
is
a
bad
engine
but
dont
highlight
reliability
when
you
comparing
it
to
a
acura
engine
and
while
the
integra
costs
alot
more
it
is
a
better
investment
since
it
will
hold
its
value
considerably
much
better
and
does
a
nice
job
at
being
a
sporty
car
and
practical
at
the
same
time
note
this
isnt
a
flame
on
the
gtz
or
other
gm
quad
products
the
berreta
is
a
nice
car
and
puts
out
respectable
performance
and
a
very
reasonable
price
not
to
mention
it
has
an
airbag
but
to
start
quoting
figures
from
one
source
isnt
too
reliable
read
other
sources

put
a

it
one

lifted
the

taking

gave
me
enough
room
to
undo
the

worked

soaked

flipped

is
this

put

i
used

a

never

agree

the

i

its
a

esp
on

however
when
she
took
it
to
a
local
subaru
dealer
for
a
oil
change
the
bill
came
out
to
be
about
dollars
the
dealer
told
us
it
is
because
to
change
the
oil
filter
on
a
svx
it
is
necessary
to
disassemble
a
metal
cover
under
the
engine
and
that
took
an
hour
of
labour
at
first
we
think
we
are
being
ripped

so
she
phone
to
a

in

but
found
out
the
they
are
charging
roughly
the

so
is
there
any

the

are
more

also
quarter
mile
times
vary
from

sounds
reasonable
probably
faster
than
regular

so
the
beretta
can
out
handle
the
integra
and
it
can
certainly
keep
up
with
it
in

and
the

probably
has
a

due

the

hptorque
for

you
always

is

considering

who

but
i
can
certainly
tell
that
something
is
there
i
wont
argue
too
much
about
anything
i
am
probably
one
of
those
that
think
that
we
cant
have
enough
safety
on
the
roads
i
would
gladly
sacrifice
distractions
as
you
call
it
than
someone
having
trouble
seeing
danger
earlier
one
saved
life
justifies
more
than
my

of

for
me

then
there
is

when
your

have
not

adjusted
to
the
poor

there
are
those
who
drive
blackgrey
cars
and
then
there
is
the
case
where
you
are
driving
down
a
twoway
one
lane
road
and
someone
is
overtaking
cars
and
coming
the
opposite
direction
doesnt
see
you
because
your
lights
are
not
on
or
vice
versa
at
that
is
quite
a
small
reaction
time
but
of
course
we
are
too
macho
to
think
we
are
invincible
and
can
react
faster
than
that
only
the
poor
sod
who
you
didnt
see
might
not
have
a
normal
life
ever
i
worked
out
the
reaction
time
in
a
previous
post
and
its
plenty
even
for
an
year
old
grandma
as
long
as
speeds
are
in
the
mph
range
or
less
if
you
or
some
other
driver
is
going
way
faster
than
that
then
be
careful
as
always
you
are
responsible
for
your
driving
actions
if
you
pull
out
to
pass
and
crash
into
someone
for
whatever
reason
its
your
fault
if
you
cant
problem
is
that
i
may
just
kill
the
guy
i
agree
that
i
would
be
at
fault
and
i
will
have
my
license
revoked
why
i
might
even
go
to
the
gas
chamber
but
the
fact
still
remains
that
the
guy
is
dead
someone
died
because
i
was
too
stingy
to
put
on
my
lights
see
a
damn
thing
then
you
shouldnt
be
driving
lights
fail
fallen
trees
or
rocks
dont
have

etc
i
maintain
that
headlight
strength
the
ratio
of
the
probability
of
fallen
treesrocks
on
the
roads
to
oncoming
traffic
is
too
low
to
even
be
considered
the
difference
is
also
working
on
what
we
know
could
happen
to
what
might
happen
running
lights
are
not
necessary
for
motorists
who
drive
around
it
may
be
a
good
idea
to
force
the
running
or
headlights
on
when
you
turn
your
windshield
wipers
on
but
only
because
some
people
are
too
stupid
to
do
so
if
you
crash
into
one
of
those
idiots
you
have
to
fight
it
out
in
court
to
show
his
neglegence
if
you
can
even
prove
it
just
out
of
curiosity
how
much
gasmilage
do
you
loose
when
you
put
your
lights
on
and
how
much
do
you
reduce
the
life
of
your
headlamps
and
what
is
the
cost
of
your
headlamps
anyway
mileage
is
certainly
reduced
but
by
a
very
very
small
amount
probably
about
watts
for
head
and
running
lights
this
is
an
extra
horsepower
that
must
be
made
by
the
engine
it
may
be
that
this
will
cost
you
around
two
gallons
a
year
but
times
million
cars
thats
a
lot
of
gas
compared
to
the
number
of
gallons
of
gas
consumed
by
those
million
cars
it
is
miniscule

tis

its
not

at
all
its
clothing
design
womens
clothing
is
generally
designed
to
be
as
nonfunctional
as
possible
its
only
been
in
the
last
five
years
or
so
that
you
could
buy
womens
pants
with
pockets
deep
enough
to
carry
anything
in
previously
deep
pockets
were
virtually
unknown
in
womens
clothing
skirts
generally
have
better
pockets
now
too
dresses
espcially
fancy
dresses
are
still
pretty
hopeless
i
often
hand
my
drivers
license
over
to
my
husband
if
were
dressed
up
to
go
out
somewhere
so
i
dont
have
to
be
encumbered
by
a
purse
if
women
consistently
bought
functional
clothing
and
boycotted
the
manufacturers
who
refuse
to
make
functional
womens
clothing
i
think
manufacturers
would
tend
to
bow
to
market
pressures
theres
an
interesting
chapter
in
susan

that
described
what
happened
the
last
time
clothing
manufacturers
ignored
the
need
for
functional
womens

the
manufactuing

lost
millions

oils
that

cold

have

in

in

place
youd
stick
in
your
car
in
the
winter
and
in
it
in
the
summer
to
approximate
the
appropriate

throughout
the
year
modern
multiviscosity
oils
change
viscosity
much
less
with
temperature
as
a
result
their

cross
over
several

a

the

a

and
a
cold
one
though
i

the

giving

figures
widely
known
the

is
rated
at
is
you
have
a
advantage
over
a

seems
that
the

is
rated
at
hp
only
because
ford
changed
its
testing
procedures
under
the
older
procedures
it
still
rates
closer

that
means
that
the

has

got

again
you
quoted

interestingly
the

es
which
is
faster
than
your

does
the

according

kind
of
embarassing
isnt
it
why
didnt
you
check

before

only
makes

look

when

the
reason
i
ask
is
because
i
went

a
classic

meet
here
in
the
uk
and
saw
a
very
nice
old

with

it

well
sweden
and
australia
and
lord
knows
wherever
else
used
to
drive
on

side
of

so
the
export
market
might
have
been
larger
then
than
just

im
guessing
but
i
believe
in
the
twenties
we
probably
drove
mostly
down
cattle
trails
and
in

ruts
i
am
fairly
sure
that
placement
of
the

wheel
was
pretty
much
arbitrary
to
the
company
at
that

by
the
there
was
a

had

also

transport
during

convinced
the

that

were
crucial
to
our
national
defense
anyway
by
the
there
were
plenty
of

at

around
urban

and
they
were

the
biggest
problem
some
people
seem
to
be
having
is
that
saturn
dealers
make
on
a
car
i
think
most
will
agree
with
me
that
the
car
is
comparably
priced
with
its
competitors
that
is
they
arent
overpriced
compared
to
most
cars
in
their
class
i
dont
understand
the
point
of
arguing
over
whether
the
dealer
makes
the
or
not
i
have
never
understood
what
the
big
deal
over
dealer
profits
is
either
the
only
thing
that
i
can
figure
out
is
that
people
believe
that
if
they
minimize
the
dealer
profit
they
will
minimize
their
total
outofpocket
expenses
for
the
car
while
this
may
be
true
in
some
cases
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
generally
true
i
bought
a
saturn
sl
in
january
of
at
that
time
based
on
studying
car
prices
i
decided
that
there
was
no
comparable
car
that
was
priced
as
cheaply
as
the
saturn
sure
maybe
i
could
have
talked
the
price
for
some
other
car
to
the
saturn
price
but
my
outofpocket
expenses
wouldnt
have
been
any
different
whats
important
to
me
is
how
much
money
i
have
left
after
i
buy
the
car
reducing
dealer
profit
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saving
money
show
me
how
reducing
dealer
profit
saves
me
money
and
ill
believe
that
its
important
my
experience
has
been
that
reducing
dealer
profit
does
not
necessarily
save
me
money
fred
say
you
bought
your
saturn
at
with
a
dealer
profit
of
if
the
dealer
profit
is
then
you
would
only
be
paying
for
the
same
car
so
isnt
that
saving
money
yes
but
the
point
is
that
prices
are
competetive
saturn
may
well
be
selling
a
car
intended
on
giving
the
dealer
a
profit
but
since
a
comperable
honda
with
profit
is
more
expensive
it
may
be
well
worth
it
to
buy
the
saturn
moreover
if
saturn
really
does
reduce
the
dealer
profit
margin
by
then
their
cars
will
be
even
better
deals
say
if
the
price
of
a
saturn
was
already
below
market
average
for
the
class
of
cars
then
after
they
reduce
the
dealer
profit
it
would
be
below
market
average
it
will
attract
even
more
people
to
buy
saturns
because
it
would
save
them
money
force
the
competitors
to
lower
their
prices
to
survive
now
not
only
will
saturn
owners
benefit
from
a
lower
dealer
profit
even
the
buyers
for
other
cars
will
pay
less
not
necessarily
it
seems
to
me
that
saturn
salesdroids
who
dont
make
a
commision
whereas
their
counterparts
at
other
dealerships
generally
do
make
more
per
hour
or
whatever
this
means
that
saturn
doesnt
give
up
the
profit
to
their
employees
through
commision
which
is
taken
out
of
per
car
profits
they
just
pass
it
along
to
less
pressureing
salesmenwomen
isnt
that
saving
money
maybe
maybe
not
depends
on
accounting
practices
id
rather
pay
more
for
dealer

doesnt

ive

i

though
i
have
to
adjust
my
initial
idea
of
why
i
am
getting
a

car
today
during
a
conversion
with
a
friend
i
learned
he
rejected
a

for
a
ford

as
it
only
costed
him
a
little
bit
more
than
a
i
may
be
wrong
but
a
loaded
tarus
beats
a

i
agree
that
a
fullyloaded
would
come
close
in
price
to
a
lowerend
ford
taurus
a
fullyloaded
taurus
on
the
other
hand
would
still
be
substantially
more
expensive
than
even
the
most

a

would

somewhere

a
fully
loaded

would
be
somewhere
around
the
range
a

i
believe
might
start
around
of
course
there
is
the
taurus
sho
which
can
push
if
you
really
try
but
this
is
a
totally
different
car
than
your
mainstream
taurus
sedan
your
statement
was
not
entirely
faulty
just
a
little
inaccurate
i
cant
see
saturn
is
of
better
value
and
that
is
why
i
was
puzzled
by
its
pricings
oh
we
did
not
spend
much
time
getting
our
deals
being
better
informed
has
its
advantages
well
thats
ok
at
least
youre
not
bitching
about
dealer
profits
like
some
of
the
other
netters
are
you
seem
to
have
rationally
picked
out
the

for
you
the

all

the

things
like

perhaps
the

on

eventually
they

to
drop
the

there
were

courtcases
where
the
owner
of
the
car
could
prove
he
didnt
drive
it
at
the

of
speeding
i
especially
recall
a
case
where
it
eventually
proved
to
be
a

that
had
stolen
a

made
false

he
ofcourse
chose

apologies

this

is
there
a
faq
posting
for
this
group
i
am
an
infrequent
reader
of
recautos
so
i
cant
remember
i
am
in
the
market
for
a
used
chevy
suburban
and
have
observed
that
prices
for
models
with
diesel
engines
run
about
less
than
comparable
models
with
a
gas
engine
there
has
to
be
a
reason
for
this
yes
there
is
consumer
confusion
in
the
early
with
the
fuel
crisis
etc
everyone
wanted
better
fuel
mileage
diesel
fuel
was
the
cheapest
fuel
available
and
usually
provides
better
mileage
than
comparable
gasoline
engines
so
gm
decided
to
conver
their
gas
engine
into
a
diesel
engine
i
think
was
a
liter
big
mistake
the
engine
was
not
redesigned
but
converted
the
engine
could
not
handle
the
higher
compression
etc
lots
of
problems
with
these
cars
this
thew
up
a
big
red
flag
to
the
casual
observer
dont
buy
a
diesel
they
are
bad
this
was
a
gross
generalization
ask
yourself
this
question
if
your
livelihood
depended
on
driving
lots
of
it
would
you
use
a
dependable
or
undependable
but
cheaper
in
the
short
run
vehicle
what
do
greyhound
busses
have
in

are

no
they
are
diesel
tractor
trailer
truck
manufacturers

a

warrantee
with
they
vehicles
i
own
an
diesel
suburban
the
diesel
is
a
great
engine
just
keeps
going
it
was
more
expensive
when
new
than
the
gasoline
engine
vehicle
was
the
only
problem
with
diesel
engines
is
that
when
they
need
to
be
rebuilt
they
are
expensive
in
a
gas
engine
you
will
pay
about
for
a
rebuild
diesel
is
about
but
then
again
the
diesel
engine
lasts
about
twice
as
long
and
gets
about
better
mileage
a
carburator
for
a
gasoline
engine
costs
about
to
rebuild
or
less
a
rebuild
of
the
fuel
injection
pump
on
a
diesel
will
cost
about
or
more
but
then
again
you
never
need
a

if
youre
looking

id
say
you
got
a

check
to

illegal
tint
windows
i
know
its
a
long
shot
but
maybe
someone
went
through
this
and
will
have
some
comments
to
share
the
story
is
this
i
bought
a
car
out
of
state
and
im
trying
to
get
the
safety
inspection
in
pennsylvania
the
problem
is
that
the
car
has
aftermarket
tint
on
all
windows
except
the
windshield
the
tint
is
rather
weak
and
you
can
clearly
see
the
inside
of
the
car
through
the
tint
the
inspection
garage
said
that
they
wont
pass
it
unless
i
get
a
waiver
from
the
state
police
so
i
went
to
the
state
police
the
officer
told
me
that
aftermarket
tint
is
illegal
and
i
can
get
a
waiver
only
for
a
car
or
for
a
medical
reason
i
asked
him
to
show
me
the
section
of
the
vehicle
code
that
says
its
illegal
he
showed
it
to
me
and
the
paraghaph
said
that
you
cant
have
tint
if
you
cant
see
the
inside
of
the
car
because
of
the
tint
when
i
told
him
that
you
can
in
fact
see
the
inside
very
well
he
shut
the
book
and
said
its
just
illegal
and
in
fact
we
can
have
someone
give
you
a
ticket
for
it
right
now
well
wont
argue
with
that
since
the
vehicle
code
says
its
ok
as
long
as
you
can
see
through
the
tint
id
like
to
keep
it
ill
reread
the
vehicle
code
in
the
library
id
also
like
to
get
some
sort
of
paper
from
the
police
that
says
its
ok
so
i
can
get
the
inspection
and
so
that
i
wont
get
in
trouble
for
the
tint
later
on
i
also
wouldnt
mind
registering
a
complaint
against
that
officer
he
really
pissed
me
off
so
does
anyone
have
any
experience
getting
that
sort
of
a
paper
from
the
police
especially
in
pennsylvania
does
anyone
have
any
experience
registering
a
complaint
against
an
officer
i
called
the
station
later
on
today
but
they
basically
said
there
is
no
place
where
i
could
register
a
complaint
against
an
officer
and
if
i
do
decide
to
keep
the
tint
and
get
a
ticket
anyway
how
much
of
a
chance
do
i
stand
to
succesfully
appeal
the
ticket
in
court
any
comments
about

will

sending
you

poorer
go
to
kmart
and
buy

yourself
for
personally
i
wouldnt
use
the

from
kmart
i
knew
about
this
previously
but
this
past
weekend
on
pbss
motorweek
pat
goss
their
resident
tech
type
discussed
these
products
and
recommends
not
using
them
ie
the
nonisopropyl
alcohlo
based
injector
cleaners
supposedly
only
the
isopropyl
based
cleaners
actually
remove
moisture
from
your
fuel
tank
as
they
clean
your
injectors
and
although
the
others
ethyl
based
do
clean
injectors
they
also
cause
rubber
components
in
the
fuel
system
to
deteriorate
and
they
dont
mix
well
with
water
to
help
remove
it
from
the
fuel
system
i
use
a
product
recommended
by
vw
called
by
bg
products
inc
it
cost
more
about
but
it
is
supposed
to
do
the
job
without
the
potential
harmful
side
effects
and
its
results
are
supposed
to
last
from
to
miles
i
have
also
used
chevrons
techtrolene
sp
i
cant
say
that
i
have
noticed
any
difference
using
either
since
i
only
use
these
product
as
a
preventative
maintenance
item
just
because
you

you

it

my

brought
a
subaru
svx
recently
i
had
drove
it
for
couples
times
and
i
think
its
a
great
car
esp
on
snow
however
when
she
took
it
to
a
local
subaru
dealer
for
a
oil
change
the
bill
came
out
to
be
about
dollars
the
dealer
told
us
it
is
because
to
change
the
oil
filter
on
a
svx
it
is
necessary
to
disassemble
a
metal
cover
under
the
engine
and
that
took
an
hour
of
labour
at
first
we
think
we
are
being
ripped
off
so
she
phone
to
a
dealer
in
toronto
but
found
out
the
they
are
charging
roughly
the
same
price
so
is
there
any
svx
owner
out
there
that
has
the

problem
and
if
the

is
true

a

like

do
i
have
two

on

i
put
my

wallent
in

many
of
the

even
have
a

on

so
i
can
close
them
securely
everything
is
that
much
simpler
for
me
why
cant
women
do
the
same
is
is
biological
ie
not
enough
room
for
a
bigger
bottom
plus
keys
and
a
wallet
or
is
it
the
way
they
are
raised
by
the
parents
womens
pants
rarely
have
pockets
and
most
when
they
do
are
too
shallow
to
use
i
is
very
important
for
a
woman
to
have
her
keys
in
her
hand
when
she
goes
from
building
to
a

it
is

a

lucky
to

on

none
on

i

this

i

womens

have

i
put
my

it

arent
the

you
would

i

because
it
has
a
good
amount
of
japanese

and
has
similar
reliability
stats
i
didnt
include
domestic
small
cars
such
as
the
cavalier
sunbird

since
i
think
saturn
is
going

if
you
look
at
the
prices
of
these
cars
theyre
more
expensive
than
theyre
counterparts
the
is
good
reason
for
this
it
is
a
more
upscale
and
trenddriven
market
even
though
many
of
these
models
are
based
on
sedan
platforms
their
interior
etc
is
good
enough
to
warrant
slightly
higher
prices
here
are
some
of
the
platform
derivations
i
can
think
of
tercel
paseo
sentra
civic
del
sol
not
sure
on
this
one
stylus
impulsestorm
to
illustrate
a
tercel
starts
at
around
while
the
paseo
starts
at
around
even
a
tercel
will
cost
less
than
a
paseo
now
you
might
be
saying
that
the
tercel
doesnt
offer
the
power
that
some
offer
what
i
mean
is
that
there
is
no
tercel
with
a
comparable
powerplant
as
its
sport
coupe
derivative
lets
take
another
example
the
isuzu
stylus
xs
and
impulse
xsstorm
gsi
both
have
the
same
powerplants
a
engine
but
the
smaller
coupes
are
generally
more
expensive
again
this
is
because
the
twodoor
sport
coupe
market
is
a
more
fashionoriented
and
trendsetting
segment
people
are
willing
to
pay
more
money
for
this
type
of
car
in
short
even
though
the
may
be
smaller
hence
less
car
its
market
orientation
dictates
a
slightly
higher
price
than
its
mechanically
equivalent
sedan
version

this
clears

did

on

right
and
even
in

as
well
as
sometimes
having
a

instead
of
a

this
was
standardized
fairly
early
on
though
i
dont
know
why
i
knew
it
was
almost
always
done

i
knew
of
no

might
not

my

a

in

the
ticket
was
for
not
stopping
at
a
stop
sign
given
the
conditions
i
could
not
stop
in
time
and
decided
instead
of
sliding
right
through
the
intersection
i
would
complete
my
rightturn
and
avoid
a
possible
accident
a
police
cruiser
happened
to
be
approaching
the
intersection
from
my
left
and
gave
me
the
ticket
the
officer
said
the
only
reason
that
you
even
slowed
down
in
the
first
place
was
that
you
saw
me
approaching
otherwise
you
would

right

decided
that
in

not
stopping
was
the
safest

to
do

found
me
not
guilty

statement

my

re

was
used
bmw
question
i
consulted
with
someone
working
on
an
electronic
odometer
the
design
was
to
use
a
microprocessor
based
system
to
write
a
somewhat
ofuscated
pattern
into
an
eeprom
the
idea
was
to
make
the
circuit
difficult
to
program
arbitrary
values
into
the
eeprom
the
secondary
purpose
acutally
the
primary
purpose
from
the
standpoint
of
practicality
was
to
distributed
the
writes
so
as
to
avoid
exceeing
the
maximum
number
of
writes
fof
the
eeprom
being
used
the
microprocessor
also
ignored
pulses
coming
from
the
hall
effect
at
a
rate
any
higher
than
mph
so
as
to
make
spoofing
the
reading
by
bench
pulsing
at
least
somewhat
undesirable
this
was
for
an
automobile
that
was
not
expected
to
ever
exceed
mph
in
operation
the
case
of
course
might
not
be
the
same
for
your
the
ecm
modules

some

do
indeed
store
info
about
conditions
under

cars
have

your
driving
style
it

my

what
is
the
general
opinion
of
aftermarket
cruise
control
units
i
realize
that
a
cheap
cc
cruise
control
from
say
pep
boys
isnt
going
to
be
as
good
as
a
factory
or
professionally
installed
unit
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
i
uderstand
that
i
probably
cant
expect
much
in
the
way
of
accuracy
looks
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
anythings
gotta
be
better
than
trying

drive

a
hosed
ankle

ignition
yknow

cap
rotor
that
setupnot
electronic
maybe
you
couldve
guessed
it
being
an
but
im
just
trying
to
give
information
as
completly
as
i
can
i
found
a
cc
unit
for
bucks
it
seems
to
use
the
vehicles
vacuum
system
instead
of
an
electric
servormotor
is
this
good
or
bad
if
i
did
buy
this
cc
which
vacuum
hose
should
i
tap
it
has
two
speed
sensors
one
magnetic
and
one
that
gets
a
signal
from
the
negative
side
of
the
distributor
kinda
like
a
tach
pickup
or
so
i
understand
i
can
use
either
one
which
is
best
the
manual
says
i
read
it
in
the
store
today
that
the
magneticaxle
setup
is
more
accurate
but
harder
to
install
is
there
really
a
big
difference
it
has
a
sensor
for
the
brake
pedal
just
like
other
ccs
but
does
not
have
a
sensor
for
the
clutch
pedal
so
if
i
wasnt
paying
real
close
attention
i
might
push
the
clutch
in
while
the
cruise
is
trying
to
get
the
speed
up
which
would
wind
the
engine
up
kinda

this
doesnt
bother
me
if
it
were
for
my

car
then
it
would
bother
me

im
ok
with
it
the
installation
also
calls
for
an
attachment
to
a
steadyon
brake
signal
and
a
switchedon
brake
signal
i
think
i
can
get
a
switched
brake
signal
from
the
correct
side
of
the
brake
light
blade
fuse
am
i
right
but
im
not
sure
where
to
get
the
steadyon
brake
signal
or
for
that
matter
what
exactly
it
is
any
ideas
as
to
what
the
manufaturer
wants
and
where
to
get
it
i
think
i
can
figure
the
other
things
out
like
how
to
hookup
the
negative
side
tachtype
sensing
gizmo
and
the
cabin
control
unit
and
the

and
all
that
miscellaneous
business
but
i
need
a
little
help
with
is
it
worth
the
money
and
safety
risk
if
any
for
such
a
device
is
there
any
particularly
good
aftermarket
cc
are
professionally
installed
ccs
signifacantly
better
and
worth
the
cabbage
if
the
unit
i
saw
sorry
no
manufacturer
or
model
number
just
that
it
is
at
pep
boy
and
its
is
sufficient
for
my
simple
needs
how
do
i
get
the
thing
installed
properly
specifically
the
questions
above
my
father
and
i
built
a
veep
volkswagen
powered
jeep
when
i
was
in
high
school
so
i
consider
myself
fairly
good
with
tools
electronics
and
cars
so
the
installation
doesnt
scare
me
i
just
want
to
be
certain
that
i
get
the
thing
installed
correctly
as
my
cherokee
is
just
a
wee
bit
more
complicated
than
my
veep
i
appreciate
your

reading
my

appreciate
any

how

spend
all

right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
on
a

of
some

after
thinking
about

ill
keep

until
it
drops

buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a

stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
early
for
around
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a

also
what
would

look

im
male

i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the

lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
in
addition
to
restricted
mileage
many
classic
insurance
carriers
also
require
that
the
vehicle
be
garaged

i
had
picked
out
the
vehicle
i
wanted
and
after
a
little
haggling
we
agreed
on
a
price
i
wrote
them
a
check
for
the
down
payment
plus
tax
and
license
and
told
them
id
be
back
that
evening
to
pick
up
the
truck
when
i
returned
i
had
to
wait
about
an
hour
before
the
finance
guy
could
get
to
me
when
i
finally
got
in
there
everything
went
smoothly
until
he
started
adding
up
the
numbers
he
then
discovered
that
they
had
miscalculated
the
tax
license
by
about
he
then
said
he
needed
another
from
me
i
said
we
had
already
agreed
on
a
price
and
it
was
their
problem
i
wasnt
giving
them
any
more
money
the
finance
guy
then
brought
in
the
manager
on
duty
who
proceeded
to
give
me
a
hard
time
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
the
customer
and
i
didnt
think
i
should
be
treated
like
that
and
that
if
he
didnt
back
off
he
could
forget
the
whole
deal
he
made
some
smart
remark
so
i
told
him
where
he
could
stick
it
snatched
back
my
check
and
left
needless
to
say
they
were
not
pleased
by
the
turn
of
events
early
the
next
morning
i
got
a
call
from
the
general
sales
manager
wanting
to
know
what
happened
i
related
the
story
and
he
apologised
profusely
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
to
change
my
mind
i
told
him
that
if
they
gave
me
the
truck
for
free
i
probably
still
wouldnt
take
it
that
there
were
other
dealers
in
town
i
was
a
repeat
customer
of
theirs
and
that
they
should
learn
how
to
treat
customersetcetci
was
still
pretty
steamed
about
the
whole
affair
he
gave
me
the
line
about
hating
to
lose
a
customer
and
they
would
try
to
find
a
solution
etc
etc
i
told
him
not
to
bother
thanks
id
go
somewhere
else
a
couple
hours
later
the
owner
of
the
dealership
called
me
all
apologetic
etc
etc
etc
and
said
that
they
would
cover
the
plus
knock
another
off
the
price
of
the
truck
i
told
him
id
think
about
it
and
he
gave
me
his
private
direct
phone
number
his
secretarys
name
and
assured
me
that
they
valued
me
as
a
customer
etc
etc
etc
i
thought
about
it
for
a
few
hours
and
discussed
it
with
my
wife
and
we
decided
what
the
hellthat
was
a
pretty
decent
deal
so
i
called
him
back
and
accepted
his
offer
when
i
went
back
the
next
day
to
pick
up
the
truck
i
received
the
royal
treatment
everyone
seemed
to
know
about
the
incident
even
the
lot
boy
everything
went
smoothly
and
i
was
out
of
there
in
my
new
truck
in
about
mins
so
i
guess
im
a
reasonably
satisfied
customer
however
it
should
not
have
happened
in
the
first
place
i
was
a
bit
shocked
to
have
a
sales
person
talk
to
me
like
that
i
dont
expect
them
to
bow
and
grovel
but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
given
a
hard
time
either
esp
when
its
their
mistake
anyway
im
happy
with
the
truck
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
couple
hundred
dollars
under
invoice
and

my

did
an

he
crawled

a

drained
the

replaced
the

then
carefully
poured
in
quarts
of

didnt
bother
to
check

just
drove
off
didnt
get
too
far
till

found

that

drained

ask

introduction
to
the
recautos
newsgroup
hierarchy
recautostech
is
intended
for
technical
discussions
of
automobiles
their
design
construction
diagnosis
and
service
other
discussions
are
largely
inappropriate
especially
for
sale
ads
recautossport
is
intended
for
discussion
of
legal
organized
competition
involving
automobiles
technical
discussions
are
appropriate
insofar
as
they
apply
to
competition
vehicles
discussion
from
either
of
two
viewpoints
spectator
and
participant
is
encouraged
arguments
about
sports
cars
are
largely
inappropriate
as
are
most
other
discussions
for
sale
ads
are
inappropriate
unless
they
are
for
competition
vehicles
andor
equipment
discussions
of
illegal
events
are
marginal
one
should
probably
avoid
advocating
breaking
the
law
remember
the
fbi
reads
usenet
recautosdriving
is
intended
for
discussions
related
to
the
driving
of
automobiles
also
if
you
must
discuss
vs
or
radar
detectors
or
insert
your
pet

do
it
here
recautosvw
is

for
discussion
of
issues
related
to
the
use
and
ownership
of
automobiles
manufactured
by
volkswagen
this
includes
vws
audis
seats
etc
it
was
created
on
the
grounds
that
the
infovw
mailing
list
was
very
successful
it
should
not
be
presumed
from
the
existence
of
this
group
that
it
is
appropriate
to
create
many
groups
to
cover
many
different
marques
groups
specific
to
individual
marques
should
only
be
created
on
demonstration
of
sufficient
interest
via
some
avenue
such
as
a
mailing
list
recaudiocar
is
not
properly
part
of
the
recautos
hierarchy
it
is
however
the
correct
place
for
discussion
of
automotive
audio
equipment
and
so
is
mentioned
here
recautosantique
is
intended
for
the
discussion
of
older
cars
usually
more
than
years
old
although
this
is
not
a
hardandfast
rule
althotrod
is
not
part
of
the
hierarchy
but
also
of
potential
interest
to
the
recautos
reader
it
is
gatewayed
to
the
moderated
hotrod
mailing
list
and
is
for
serious
discussion
of
modifying
and
developing
performance
vehicles
altautosrodncustom
also
not
part
of
the
official
hierarchy
devoted
to
that
peculiar

crossposting
crossposting
occurs
when
more
than
one
newsgroup
name
is
included
on
the
newsgroups
line
in
the
article
header
such
articles
will
appear
in
all
of
the
newsgroups
listed
crossposting
is
one
of
the
most
misunderstood
and
misused
facilities
on
usenet
you
should
only
post
to
a
group
because
you
feel
an
article
is
appropriate
you
should
never
crosspost
just
to
reach
a
particular
audience
this
distinction
is
subtle
but
important
radar
detector
articles
for
example
are
moreorless
appropriate
in
recautos
they
are
almost
never
appropriate
in
scielectronics
or
rechamradio
and
the
fact
that
you
might
want
to
reach
the
audience
in
scielectronics
or
rechamradio
is
not
adequate
justification
for
posting
to
either
group
crossposting
between
any
or
all
of
the
recautos
groups
is
usually
inappropriate
if
you
find
yourself
doing
so
consider
whether
or
not
it
is
truly
advisable
before
sending
your
article
consider
setting
followupto
to
point
to
only
one
newsgroup
if
you
feel
you
must
crosspost
crossposting
between
recautos
and
miscconsumers
is
chancy
at
best
in
particular
flame
wars
over
the
speed
limit
in
the
us
andor
the
use
of
radar
detectors
should
never
be
crossposted
between
any
of
these
groups
most
readers
of
scielectronics
and
recradio
couldnt
care
less
about
the
police
radar
and
radar
detector
arguments
that
go
on
endlessly
in
recautos
it
is
an
excellent
idea
to
check
the
newsgroups
and
followupto
lines
of
articles
before
posting
a
followup
in
particular
be
wary
of
posting
to
misctest
recartsstartrek
or
talkbizarre
or
any
combination
of
these
three
the
life
you
save
may
be
your
own
distribution
there
is
a
field
in
the
header
of
any
news
article
which
allows
you
to
partially
control
where
the
article
goes
it
is
called
the
distribution
field
it
may
be
very
useful
for
many
reasons
it
should
also
serve
as
a
reminder
that
news
is
a
very
large
and
widespread
system
the
distribution
of
recautos
is
fairly
extensive
as
of
this
writing
the
automotive
newsgroups
are
known
to
reach
most
of
europe
australia
new
zealand
and
some
locations
in
japan
with
this
in
mind
i
offer
the
following
hints
about
use
of
the
distribution
field
in
your
article
headers
and
on
article
content
please
take
care
not
to
send
forsale
ads
about
clapped
out
ford
mavericks
in
new
jersey
to
france
or
california
i
doubt
that
anyone
in
either
place
will
care
except
for
my
girlfriend
who
for
some
strange
reason
likes
mavericks
but
only
mavericks
at
that
when
posting
technical
questions
please
include
the
market
for
which
your
car
was
manufactured
for
example
there
are
a
number
of
differences
between
a
europeanmarket
ford
escort
and
a
usmarket
escort
likewise
all
and
early
alfa
romeos
reached
the
us
with
spica
fuel
injection
european
market
cars
usually
got
carbs
often
webers
these
differences
can
be
important
to
your
readers
make
your
situation
clear
failure
to
do
so
can
lead
to
pointless
flame
wars
and
a
significant
spread
of
misinformation
be
careful
about
your
capacities
and
specifications
when
posting
in
the
us
we
get
a
mix
of
metric
and
english
system
values
whereas
europe
is
almost
entirely
on
the
metric
system
a
future
edition
of
this
monthly
posting
will
contain
a
list
of
commonlyused
abbreviations
that
may
not
be
known
in
some
places
that
recautos
reaches
this
cuts
both
ways
so
let
us
not
be
parochial
about
it
use
the
distribution
field
to
limit
where
your
article
goes
when
possible
within
north
america
the
values
na
north
america
can
canada
and
usa
may
be
used
in
addition
the
twoletter
state
abbreviations
of
the
us
are
supported
in
some
cases
eg
if
i
wanted
to
send
an
article
only
to
new
york
and
new
jersey
i
could
put
nynj
in
a
distribution
field
note
that
multiple
commaseparated
values
are
legal
these
distribution
fields
vary
widely
however
so
you
should
check
with
your
local
sysadmin
to
find
out
what
is
likely
to
be
supported
in
your
area
the
dangers
of
overgeneralization
to
amplify
a
warning
from
the
distribution
section
of
this
article
be
wary
of
making
foolish
assumptions
about
all
cars
tires
etc
what
is
true
for
a
buick
with
a
engine
may
be
quite
utterly
wrong
for
a
honda
with
a
engine
headlight
laws
in
sweden
are
decidedly
different
from
those
in
idaho
the
need
for
adequate
specification
when
you
ask
a
question
please
give
a
reasonable
amount
of
information
eg
if
you
have
a
question
about
your
honda
please
specify
year
model
engine
size
etc
otherwise
most
answers
to
your
question
may
be
quite
useless
concerning
lemons
at
one
time
or
another
every
auto
manufacturer
has
manufactured
a
lemon
or
two
even
honda
admits
to
this
please
dont
waste
everyones
time
by
announcing
to
the
world
that
your
brand
x
automobile
is
terrible
so
all
brand
x
automobiles
are
terrible
so
no
one
should
ever
buy
a
car
from
the
brand
x
company
such
articles
are
worse
than
useless
because
they
cause
substantial
wasted
bandwidth
while
carrying
little
or
no
useful
information
concerning
flames
as
much
as
we
might
wish
it
a
flamefree
newsgroup
is
something
that
most
likely
will
never
occur
here
are
some
guidelines
for
flames
and
how
to
deal
with
them
a
list
of
flameprone
topics
follows
in
the
next
section
of
this

if
you
post
something
truly
obnoxious
and
inflammatory
dont
imagine
for
a
minute
that
including
the
words
no
flames
will
work
it
wont
and
youll
get
exactly
what
you
deserve
if
youre
going
to
flame
youre
more
likely
to
get
away
with
it
if
you
can
cite
a
fact
or
maybe
a
wellknown
reference
no
one
is
likely
to
believe
bald
unsupported
assertions
be
careful
about
who
you
choose
to
insult
consider
not
insulting
anyone
asking
the
question
it
is
a
bad
idea
to
post
a
question
and
end
it
with
a
phrase
like
please
send

i
dont
read
this

it
is

better
idea
to

with
please
send

if
there
is
sufficient
interest
ill
summarize
the
results
in
a
later
posting
i
may
miss

responses
to
this
request
answering
the
question
if
someone
wants
to
hop
up
their
yugo
dont
tell
them
to
get
a
mustang
either
be
silent
or
give
them
useful
advice
if
someone
wants
advice
on
defending
a
speeding
ticket
dont
tell
them
to
obey
the
law
next
time
its
offensive
presumes
guilt
which
is
not
proven
and
doesnt
directly
address
the
original
question
in
general
dont
post

order
to
see
your
words
in

and
dont
post

to
enjoy
feeling
smug
and
selfrighteous
stale

topics
certain
topics
are
considered
stale
by
old
timers
while
discussion
of
them
is
certainly
ok
and
new
factual
information
is
welcome
ravings
about
them
are
extremely
tiresome
and
may
get
the
person
who
posts
them
ignored
altogether
some
topics
are
naturally
inflammatory
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
have
meaningful
discussion
of
them
some
of
these
topics
include
the
following
the
speed
limit
in
the

pro
and
con
discussions
about
the
morality
and
legality

tire
questions
q
what
do
the
funny
numbers
on
the
sides
of
my
tires
mean
a
typically
you
will
see
something
like
the
is
the
overall
width
of
the
tire
in
millimeters
the
tread
is
usually
narrower
the
is
the
aspect
ratio
it
indicates
the
height
of
the
sidewall
of
the
tire
relative
to
the
overall
width
our
example
tire
has
a
sidewall
height
of
mm
the
is
the
wheel
diameter
in
inches
there
are
also
some
special
tires
called
trx
tires
which
have
three
digit
metric
wheel
diameter
designations
like
which
is
in
millimeters
the
r
means
radial
and
the
h
is
a
speed
rating
indicating
the
highest
speed
at
which
the
tire
when
properly
inflated
and
carrying
an
appropriate
load
may
safely
operate
common
speed
ratings
are
s
t
h
and
v
up
to
recent
changes
to
the
method
for
specifying
tire
sizes
move
the
speed
rating
to
a
different
part
of
the
designation
you
may
therefore
find
designations
like
the
indicates
the
pertire
load
associated
with
the
speed
rating
exceeding
this
load
in
continuous
operation
at
the
rated
speed
is
dangerous
practice
what
follows
is
a
table
showing
a
number
of
load
indices
and
corresponding
maximum
pertire
loads

kg
note
that
the
usual
mass
vs
weight
confusion
occurs
in
this
table
in
some
cases
the
letters
p
or
lt
may
be
found
in
front
of
a
tire
size
the
lt
designation
indicates
light
truck
and
the
p
designation
indicates
passenger
car
if
no
letter
is
given
then
the
application
of
the
tire
is
passenger
car
usage
as
far
as
i
know
these
letters
only
appear
in
the
us
market
the
lt
designation
is
prinicipally
of
interest
to
owners
of
light
trucks
and
other
utility
vehicles
for
the
owner
of
a
passenger
vehicle
there
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
a
tire
with
a
p
designation
and
one
with
no
designation
at
all
if
the
aspect
ratio
is
omitted
it
is
probably
but
may
be
tires
with
an

may
have
their

about
there
is
an
additional
set
of

temperature
and
traction
are
graded
a
b
and
c
with
a
the
best
and
c
the
worst
treadwear
is
a
numeric
rating
these
values
are
of
limited
value
as
they
are
assigned
somewhat
arbitrarily
by
tire
manufacturers
and
are
thus
not
useful
in

q
my
car
has
tires
with
a
funny
size
designation
can
i
put
normal
tires
on
the
car
a
your
tires
are
called
trx
tires
they
were
devised
by
michelin
because
of
a
somewhat
different
bead
design
they
are
incompatible
with
normal
tires
michelin
used
a
different
diameter
wheel
for
them
so
that
they
could
not
be
mounted
on
the
wrong
type
wheel
and
so
that
more
conventional
tires
could
not
be
mounted
on
trx
type
wheels
you
will
need
to
aquire
different
wheels
to
put
a
normal
tire
on
your
car
it
is
barely
possible
to
fit
normal
tires
on
trx
wheels
and
horribly
dangerous
to
do
so
the
tires
may
simply
peel
off
the
rims
in
a
corner
or
possibly
blow
out
at
high
speed
trx
type
tires
are
becoming
hard
to
find
in
addition
to
michelin
avon
makes
suitable
tires
goodyear
has
apparently
discontinued
their
line
of
trx
tires
q
can
i
rotate
radials
from
side
to
side
or
rotate
them
only
on
one
side
of
my
car
a
car
and
tire
manufacturers
have
differing
views
on
this
subject
many
say
that
swapping
radials
between
the
left
and
right
hand
sides
of
a
car
is
now
ok
this
group
includes
michelin
and
goodyear
others
for
example
pirelli
and
nokia
will
void
warranties
if
such
swapping
is
done
the
best
advice
is
to
read
your
tire
manual
carefully
before
rotating
your
tires
and
stick
to
the
manufacturers
recommendations
q
how
many
snow
tires
should
i
buy
and
if
i
buy
which
end
of
the
car
should
i
put
them
on
a
in
short
and
both
ends
to
explain
many
drivers
in
areas
that
dont
get
excessive
snow
or
who
dont
drive
agressively
or
at
all
in
snow
conditions
get
away
with
only
two
snows
on
the
drive
wheels
but
there
are
circumstances
where
this
can
be
dangerous
practice
with
a
rear
wheel
drive
car
you
can
choose
between
being
able
to
start
the
car
going
a
function
of
the
rear
axle
or
stopping
and
turning
the
car
a
function
of
the
front
axle
in
a
front
wheel
drive
car
you
start
stop
and
turn
with
the
front
end
the
primary
risk
of
putting
the
snow
tires
on
the
front
only
is
that
if
you
have
to
put
on
the
brakes
while
going
downhill
you
run
a
serious
risk
of
going
downhill

safety
equipment
q
do
airbags
really
work
a
preliminary
statistics
suggest
the
following
airbags
work
much
better
than
no
belts
good
point
belts
alone
work
much
better
than
airbags
alone
and
airbags
point
belts
work
slightly
better
than
point
belts
alone
the
con
to
airbags
is
that
some
designs
tend
to
burn
the
drivers
hands
when
venting
the
byproducts
of
the
explosion
that
occurs
inside
the
bag
and
that
some
designs
but
not
all
may
knock
the
drivers
hands
from
the
wheel
making
retention
of
control
of
the
vehicle
after
the
bag
deflates
more
difficult
brake
questions
q
do
i
always
need
to
get
the
rotors
on
my
disk
brakes
turned
midas
always
wants
to
do
this
a
no
there
are
specific
conditions
that
mandate
turning
or
replacing
rotors
some
shops
try
and
make
a
little
extra
money
by
replacing
rotors
more
often
than
is
strictly
necessary
if
the
rotors
are
not
warped
warped
and
only
lightly
grooved
then
there
is
no
need
to
replace
or
to
turn
them
note
also
that
some
rotors
the
rotors
on
many
hondas
are
a
good
example
are
so
narrow
to
begin
with
that
it
is
not
practical
to
turn
them
they
must
be
replaced
when
they
become
too
thin
warped
or
badly
grooved
q
they
tell
me
i
should
downshift
when
braking
to
slow
my
car
down
is
this
really
a
good
idea
a
it
used
to
be
a
very
good
idea
back
in
the
days
of
mediocre
fade
prone
drum
brakes
in
modern
disc
brake
equipped
cars
use
of
downshifting
to
slow
the
car
is
not
really
necessary
except
in
cases
of
long
steep
downhill
runs
otherwise
modern
disc
brakes
are
more
than
adequate
to
stop
a
passenger
car
in
all
circumstances
and
they
are
much
cheaper
to
repair
than
clutch
linings
on
the
other
hand
many
standard
drivers
license
tests
in
the
usa
still
specify
that
the
driver
being
tested
downshift
under
braking
i
suggest
that
before
taking
a
us
drivers
test
you
either
learn
to
do
this
smoothly
which
takes
some
time
and
practice
or
borrow
a
car
with
an
automatic
to
take
the
test
q
how
often
should
i
replace
my
brake
fluid
a
probably
more
often
than
you
do
traditional
brake
fluids
tend
to
absorb
water
this
water
can
corrode
internal
parts
of
the
brake
system
and
also
lower
the
boiling
point
of
the
fluid
type
are
older
fluids
and
are
newer
specifications
the
principal
differences
are
in
wet
and
dry
boiling
points
the
dry
boiling
point
is
important
in
fresh
brake
fluid
but
the
wet
boiling
point
is
important
in
older
brake
fluid
fluids
have
the
lowest
wet
and
dry
boiling
point
requirements
fluids
have
better
boiling
point
requirements
and
fluids
have
the
best
boiling
point
requirements
but
fluids
are
not
clearly
superior
see
the
next
qa
for
more
details
while
the
requirements
imply
that
fluids
are
better
than
fluids
there
may
be
specific
cases
where
a
fluid
is
preferable
but
these
are
mostly
competition
applications
otherwise
type
fluids
offer
much
improved
brake
pedal
feel
replacement
once
a
year
is
recommended
for
fluids
although
agressive
drivers
may
profit
by
changing
out
fluid
more
frequently
or
at
least
bleeding
a
modest
amount
of
fluid
out
of
the
brake
calipers
fairly
regularly
q
what
about
brake
fluids
a
this
breaks
down
in
to
two
parts
the
specification
looks
excellent
for
performance
but
the
first
fluids
were
silicone
based
silicone
fluids
are
a
tricky
proposition
unlike
and
fluids
they
do
not
absorb
water
at
all
while
this
may
sound
like
a
feature
the
problem
is
that
any
water
present
pools
up
in
such
systems
interfering
with
braking
performance
and
corroding
any
metals
at
the
spot
where
the
pooling
is
occuring
the
water
will
tend
to
migrate
downwards
in
the
braking
system
to
the
brake
calipers
where
most
of
the
corrosion
occurs
because
of
this
phenomenon
it
is
essential
when
converting
to
silicone
to
empty
the
entire
brake
system
and
flush
it
throughly
beforehand
some
even
recommend
replacing
all
rubber
parts
in
the
brake
system
when
converting
to
silicone
fluids
two
other
issues
that
come
up
with
silicone
fluids
they
are
difficult
to
pour
cleanly
that
is
without
air
bubbles
which
interferes
with
getting
a
good
brake
pedal
feel
and
while
they
generally
have
much
higher
boiling
points
than
fluids
they
do
have
high
temperature
failure
modes
which
are
indistinguishable
in
effect
from
boiling
fluids
silicone
fluids
may
make
sense
in
some
street
car
applications
but
they
are
certainly
not
recommended
for
high
performance
driving
applications
and
the
economics
are
questionable
for
street
use
i
have
recently
become
aware
of
new
fluids
that
meet
the
standard
that
do
not
contain
silicones
these
fluids
appear
to
be
reasonably
compatible
with
the
older
and
fluids
but
i
have
little
information
at
this
time
q
abs
is
available
on
some
of
the
cars
im
looking
at
but
it
costs
more
is
it
worth
it
a
this
does
not
have
a
cut
and
dried
answer
therefore
this
answer
will
be
quite
long
in
order
to
cover
the
pros
and
cons
the
short
answer
is
that
abs
costs
more
both
initially
and
to
maintain
will
generally
work
better
for
the
average
driver
that
is
to
say
a
driver
who
does
not
have
extensive
experience
in
high
performance
driving
techniques
and
may
require
the
unlearning
of
some
obsolete
braking
techniques
like
pump
braking
which
should
be
unlearned
in
any
case
now
for
the
long
answer
abs
works
by
monitering
the
wheels
of
the
car
looking
for
signs
of
locked
brakes
it
may
or
may
not
be
able
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
different
wheels
there
are
several
systems
on
the
market
it
cannot
detect
impending
lockup
which
is
what
you
would
really
want
in
an
ideal
world
but
only
the
existence
of
lockup
the
sensors
used
vary
some
of
the
less
well
designed
sensors
are
sensitive
to
tire
size
and
to
brake
pad
material
and
may
cease
to
function
properly
if
the
owner
deviates
from
original
equipment
or
oeequivalent
components
when
the
sensors
detect
lockup
the
abs
system
responds
by
unlocking
the
brakes
either
individually
or
all
at
once
depending
on
the
system
if
the
driver
keeps
their
foot
firmly
planted
the
abs
will
end
up
cycling
between
the
locked
and
unlocked
states
if
a
sensor
existed
that
could
detect
impending
lockup
then
we
could
sit
right
at
that
point
which
is
where
maximum
braking
effect
is
achieved
this
pulsing
can
often
be
felt
in
the
brake
pedal
as
the
system
cycles
the
percentage
of
the
time
that
the
brakes
are
truly
engaged
is
called
the
duty
cycle
typically
in
an
abs
system
this
is
about
on
dry
pavement
a
trained
driver
can
beat
this
duty
cycle
quite
reliably
using
a
technique
called
threshold
braking
on
wet
pavement
braking
is
so
chancy
that
abs
will
outperform
threshold
braking
nearly
every
time
unfortunately
on
mud
and
on
snow
often
maximum
braking
effect
can
be
acheived
with
the
brakes
locked
only
audi
of
the
manufacturers
producing
absequipped
cars
has
seen
fit
to
provide
a
disable
switch
for
the
abs
system
for
this
eventuality
a
particularly
important
feature
of
abs
is
that
it
preserves
steering
control
this
is
the
case
simply
because
if
you
are
braking
near
the
limit
and
turn
the
wheel
the
abs
will
release
the
brakes
if
it
sees
steeringtriggered
lockup
and
back
off
on
the
percentage
of
the
time
that
the
brakes
are
applied
braking
distances
will
lengthen
accordingly
an
important
caution
abs
cannot
exceed
the
maximum
theoretical
braking
force
in
any
given
situation
if
you
start
sliding
on
glare
ice
dont
expect
an
abs
system
to
help
you
out
very
much
the
coefficient
of
friction
is
not
changed
by
the
presence
of
an
abs
system
in
your
car
as
far
as
maintenence
goes
in
addition
to
the
potential
restrictions
ive
listed
above
you
have
to
worry
about
the
following
parts
costs
are
much
higher
the
oe
master
cylinder
for
my
obscure
european
sedan
lists
for
but
the
oe
master
cylinder
for
the
absequipped
version
of
the
same
car
lists
for
over
most
manufacturers
explicitly
forbid
use
of
silicone
brake
fluids
in
absequipped
vehicles
because
of
the
potential
cost
of
replacement
of
corroded
brake
system
components
regular
i
suggest
annual
replacement
of
brake
fluid
becomes
very
important
q
what
about
this
threshold
braking
business
a
normally
id
not
put
this
in
the
consumers
qa
but
recent
publicity
about
a
number
of
accidents
involving
police
drivers
in
absequipped
chevy
caprices
suggests
that
this
section
is
needed
here
rpw
threshold
braking
is
a
technique
practiced
by
all
serious
high
performance
drivers
if
made
a
habit
it
replaces
the
stab
the
pedal
and
lock
em
up
panic
habit
entirely
and
is
much
to
be
prefered
basically
the
premise
is
that
tires
generate
maximum
braking
force
when
they
have
just
started
to
slide
but
just
before
the
wheels
lock
up
entirely
drivers
who
threshold
brake
learn
to
feel
what
this
threshold
feels
like
and
learn
to
search
for
it
and
hit
it
on
the
application
of
the
brake
pedal
in
many
cars
you
can
feel
that
you
are
near
the
threshold
when
the
pedal
starts
to
firm
up
as
you
depress
it
in
any
case
if
you
cant
hear
the
tires
whine
just
a
bit
youre
not
very
near
the
threshold
in
a
car
with
abs
often
there
is
a
twinge
in
the
pedal
just
before
the
system
starts
cycling
if
the
driver
backs
off
on
the
pedal
just
a
tad
when
the
twinge
is
felt
then
they
are
very
close
to
the
threshold
and
theyll
probably
achieve
better
stopping
distances
than
if
they
just
punched
it
and
let
the
abs
take
over
recently
there
has
been
a
rash
of
publicity
over
a
number
of
accidents
and
one
death
involving
police
cars
equipped
with
abs
systems
the
police
departments
in
question
quickly
blamed
the
new
abs
systems
but
according
to
autoweek
magazine
it
now
seems
clear
that
the
problem
was
a
lack
of
training
none
of
the
involved
officers
had
any
recent
performance
driving
training
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
drivers
reacted
to
the
pulsing
brake
pedal
by
pump
braking
an
old
and
discredited
technique
of
stabbing
and
releasing
the
brake
pedal
the
goal
being
to
try
and
get
brakes
back
with
a
failing
hydraulic
system
if
you
think
about
it
for
a
minute
youll
realize
that
pump
braking
must
cut
the
effective
operation
of
a
working
brake
system
by
at
least
so
if
you
cut
the
duty
cycle
of
an
abs
system
by
that
much
you
are
giving
up
most
of
your
brakes
for
the
wrong
reason
threshold
braking
has
the
advantage
in
that
it
is
an
effective
and
useful
technique
regardless
of
whether
your
car
has
abs
if
you
do
fear
a
failed
hydraulic
system
then
one
or
two
stabs
at
the
pedal
will
be
sufficient

questions
q
does
high
octane
gasoline
help
a
maybe
maybe
not
some
cars
have
knock
sensors
and
can
adjust
the
engine
timing
or
turbocharger
boost
to
suit
the
gasoline
being
used
on
most
cars
however
you
should
use
the
cheapest
gas
that
makes
your
car
run
well
check
your
owners
manual
for
details
on
what
your
car
needs
q
my
car
was
made
for
leaded
gasoline
will
unleaded
gas
hurt
it
a
it
is
possible
that
unleaded
gas
may
slightly
increase
valve
wear
although
the
amoco
oil
company
argues
otherwise
the
actual
increase
in
valve
wear
will
be
almost
unnoticeable
however
as
modern
leaded
gasolines
actually
contain
very
little
lead
you
should
however
check
your
owners
manual
many
cars
from
the
early
do
not
actually
require
leaded
gasoline
q
do
fuel
treatments
help
what
kind
should
i
use
a
some
do
and
some
dont
during
the
winter
it
is
a
good
idea
to
use
dry
gas
however
some
may
be
harmful
to
fuel
injection
systems
never
use
an
additive
containing
methanol
sometimes
called
methyl
alcohol
such
additives
may
damage
fuel
systems
in
cars
with
carbs
and
almost
certainly
will
damage
cars
with
fuel
injection
manufacturers
opinions
vary
on
additives
containing
ethanol
sometimes
called
ethyl
alcohol
if
your
car
has
fuel
injection
check
the
owners
manual
on
your
car
before
using
these
most
manufacturers
consider
ethanol
acceptable
in
gasoline
additives
with
isopropyl
alcohol
isopropanol
and
petroleum
distillates
are
fine
in
fuel
injected
cars
an
occasional
bottle
of
fuel
injector
cleaner
is
helpful
in
cars
with
fuel
injectors
although
many
premium
gasolines
contain
detergents
that
do
the
same
job
some
off
brands
of
fuel
injector
cleaners
contain
ethanol
or
methanol
always
check
the
ingredients
before
putting
anything
in
your
gas
tank
there
are
a
small
number
of
particularly
good
additives
these
are
noticeably
more
expensive
that
the
runofthemill
ones
but
work
much
much
better
among
these
are
chevron
techron
redline
wurth
lubrimoly
ventil
sauber
and
bg
a
bottle
of
one
of
these
once
every
six
months
is
highly
recommended
q
what
about
detergent
gasolines
a
the
quality
of
detergent
packages
in
gasolines
varies
somewhat
bmw
has
instituted
a
testing
program
and
gasoline
brands
which
pass
this
test
may
advertise
that
fact
stickers
indicating
passage
of
the
test
are
now
beginning
to
appear
on
fuel
pumps
at
gas
stations
if
such
gasolines
are
used
then
fuel
injector
cleaners
are
probably
optional
beforewarned
that
while
use
of
bmw
approved
gasolines
will
keep
a
clean
engine
clean
they
may
not
clean
a
motor
with
bad
valve
deposits
lubrication
questions
q
what
do
the
numbers
and
letters
in
a
motor
oil
designation
mean
a
there
are
several
different
items
encoded
there
is
a
twoletter
code
indicating
the
type
of
detergent
package
that
the
manufacturer
uses
in
the
oil
this
looks
like
sesfcd
or
such
the
s
codes
are
for
gasoline
engine
applications
the
c
codes
are
for
diesel
engine
applications
the
second
letter
is
assigned
in
sequence
as
new
levels
of
protection
are
developed
thus
sf
is
considered
better
than
se
se
is
considered
better
than
sd
and
so
forth
the
more
noticeable
designation
is
the
oil
weight
this
is
either
a
single
number
eg
weight
or
a
pair
of
numbers
separated
by
the
letter
w
eg
the
latter
type
is
much
more
commonly
used
these
days
and
are
the
only
type
that
most
automobile
manufacturers
specify
in
operators
manuals
the
first
number
in
the
designation
is
the
apparent
viscosity
of
the
oil
when
it
is
cold
the
w
stands
for
winter
the
second
number
is
the
viscosity
of
the
oil
when
hot
there
is
a
trick
here
the
oil
doesnt
actually
get
thicker
turn
from
weight
to
weight
as
it
gets
hotter
what
is
actually
happening
is
that
when
the
oil
is
cold
it
has
the
viscosity
of
a
cold
weight
oil
as
it
gets
hotter
it
doesnt
get
thin
as
fast
as
a
oil
would
by
the
time
it
is
up
to
temperature
it
has
the
viscosity
of
a
hot
weight
oil
note
that
these
numbers
actually
specify
ranges
of
viscosities
not
all
oils
have
exactly
the
same
viscosity
when
cold
and
not
all
weight
oils
have
the
same
viscosity
when
hot
note
also
that
the
novel
behaviour
of
multigrade
oils
is
caused
by
additives
and
it
has
been
reported
that
with
the
sole
exception
of
castrol
gtx
oils
do
not
retain
their
multigrade
characteristics
well
over
time
and
oils
work
very
well
though
q
are
quick
lube
places
any
good
a
some
do
adequate
work
but
there
are
quite
a
few
incompetent
ones
out
there
let
the
buyer
beware
watch
them
while
they
work
make
sure
that
they
dont
overtorque
the
oil
drain
plug
and
keep
your
hand
on
your
wallet
at
all
times
q
are
oil
additives
like
or
tufoil
any
good
a
and
tufoil
are
ptfebased
additives
many
of
these
have
come
onto
the
market
recently
they
are
different
from
the
molybased
additives
that
have
been
around
since
the
early
ptfe
is
the
chemical
name
for
teflontm
a
trademark
owned
by
dupont
in
general
auto
manufacturers
do
not
recommend
use
of
these
products
most
usenet
responses
to
questions
on
these
additives
are
favorable
slight
increase
of
mpg
after
application
smoother
revving
but
long
term
results
whether
ptfe
additives
are
effective
after
miles
are
debatable
some
manufacturers
such
as
saab
claim
that
either
the
product
or
the
engine
flush
that
preceeds
application
causes
deterioration
of
the
oil
seals
and
eventual
leakage
some
bmw
owners
have
reported
death
of
valve
seals
shortly
after
the
addition
of
slick
to
their
cars
this
writer
has
been
cautioned
by
a
dealer
that
should
not
be
used
in
japanese
motors
as
it
may
clog
the
oil
return
passages
in
the
engine
otherwise
there
are
no
known
reports
of
damage
caused
by
ptfe
additives
on
the
other
hand
there
are
satified
slick
customers
in
the
world
q
do
synthetic
oils
really
work
a
yes
but
more
specifically
most
auto
manufactuers
accept
synthetics
but
disagree
with
the
extremely
long
oil
change
intervals
claimed
by
oil
manufacturers
auto
manufacturers
recommend
that
you
continue
to
change
oil
at
the
intervals
recommended
in
the
owners
manual
for
your
car
even
if
you
decide
to
try
the
longer
intervals
at
least
change
the
oil
filter
at
regular
intervals
as
synthetics
get
just
as
dirty
as
conventional
oils
synthetic
gear
lubricants
for
manual
transmissions
are
another
matter
entirely
amsoil
redline
and
agip
are
very
highly
regarded
and
very
effective
mobil
synthetic
gear
lube
gets
mixed
reviews
however
q
manufacturers
are
specifying
longer
and
longer
oil
change
intervals
how
often
should
i
change
my
oil
a
it
depends
on
how
you
drive
if
your
car
always
or
nearly
always
gets
warmed
up
and
you
dont
drive
it
very
hard
and
keep
the
revs
down
the
manufacturers
recommendation
is
probably
fine
if
however
you
drive
it
hard
drive
it
at
high
revs
or
alternatively
if
you
only
drive
it
to
and
from
the
supermarket
so
that
it
doesnt
get
up
to
temperature
then
you
may
wish
to
change
oil
much
more
often
perhaps
at
mile
intervals
given
that
most
manufacturers
are
now
specifying
mile
intervals
if
you
dont
drive
your
car
much
at
all
say
miles
a
year
then
you
probably
want
to
change
oil
every
six
months
anyway
if
you
are
storing
a
car
during
the
winter
then
change
oil
before
storing
it
and
change
oil
when
you
bring
it
out
of
storage
misc
questions
q
my
car
has
a
timing
belt
i
hear
that
bad
things
happen
when
they
break
whats
the
story
a
it
depends
on
the
internal
design
of
the
motor
early
ford
escorts
for
example
will
suffer
severe
valve
damage
if
the
belt
breaks
but
the
newer
cars
will
just
require
a
tow
and
installation
of
a
new
belt
some
honda
motors
will
not
be
damaged
but
others
will
be
if
no
replacement
interval
is
specified
for
your
car
then
change
the
belt
at
least
every
miles
some
cars
may
require
more
frequent
replacement
ask
your
dealer
or
independent
mechanic
also
ask
if
there
are
any
related
repairs
that
should
take
place
at
the
same
time
for
example
the
same
ford
escorts
that
suffer
valve
damage
also
have
a
timing
belt
driven
water
pump
which
has
been
known
to
seize
destroying
the
timing
belt
and
which
then
causes
major
valve
damage
as
a
side
effect
replacing
the
timing
belt
while
ignoring
the
water
pump
can
be
a
costly
mistake
q
why
would
anyone
be
stupid
enough
to
design
a
motor
so
that
it
self
destructs
when
the
timing
belt
breaks
a
for
performance
reasons
compromising
piston
design
so
that
the
valves
and
pistons
will
not
collide
requires
that
the
compression
ratio
of
the
engine
be
reduced
significantly
this
is
why
you
are
more
likely
to
avoid
valve
damage
in
economy
cars
than
in
performance
oriented
vehicles
q
what
causes
unintended
acceleration
a
the
final
report
of
the
national
highway
transportation
and
safety
administration
concluded
that
unintended
acceleration
could
not
be
caused
by
any
mechanical
failure
of
the
vehicle
in
question
and
at
the
same
time
be
consistent
with
the
physical
evidence
the
nhtsa
report
goes
on
to
conclude
that
pedal
misapplication
by
the
vehicle
operator
is
probably
the
cause

militech
i
saw
an
interesting
product
in
ny
auto
show
and
would
like
to
hear
your
comments
militechtm
is
yet
another
oil
additive
but
the
demonstration
of
this
product
really
impressive
if
it
didnt
cheat
the
setup
of
the
demo
is
fairly
simple
a
cone
shaped
rotor
is
half
submerged
in
a
small
oil
sink
filled
with
motor
oil
the
rotor
is
powered
by
an
electronic
motor
a
metal
pad
is
pressed
against
the
rotor
using
the
torque
wrench
until
the
rotor
stopped
by
friction
the
torque
that
is
needed
to
stop
rotor
is
read
from
the
torque
wrench
before
militech
was
added
the
rotor
was
stopped
with
about
lbft
of
torque
you
pick
the
brand
of
oil
no
difference
once
militech
was
added
to
the
oil
the
rotor
could
not
be
stopped
even
with
lbft
of
torque
here
is
the
good
part
even
after
the
salesman
emptied
the
oil
sink
you
still
could
not
stopped
the
rotor
with
the
thin
film
remained
on
it
they
say
you
need
only
add
per
quart
of
oil
every
miles
a
oz
bottle
is
i
still
have
my
doubts
if
this
product
is
really
so
great
why
it
was
so
little
known
the
salesman
said
it
is
widely
used

legislation
which

chances

a
great

q
where
are

used
do
they

a
usage
is
spreading
rapidly
initially
they
were
used
only
in
canada
but
now
they
are
appearing
in
new
york
and
virginia
it
is
unsafe
to
assume
that
they
are
not

in
connecticut
and
dc
they
work
by
detecting
a

super
het

detectors
some
brands
of
detector
radiate
more
strongly
than
others
and
are
thus
more
likely
to
be
spotted
new
radar
detectors
are
becoming
available
which
may
not
be
detected
by
the
current
generation
of
detector
detectors
note
that
a

may
only
be
spotted
by
one
of
these
devices
if
it
is
turned

q
what
is
vascar
is
it
some
kind
of
radar
a
vascar
is
nothing
more
than
a
fancy
stopwatch
and
timespeeddistance
computer
it
depends
on
the
operator
pressing
buttons
as
the
target
vehicle
passes
landmarks
no
radar
signals
are
emitted
by
a
vascar
system
q
what
is
ka
band
radar
where
is
it
used
should
a
radar
detector
be
able
to
handle
it
a
ka
band
has
recently
been
made
available
by
the
fcc
for
use
in
the
us
in
socalled
photoradar
installations
in
these
installations
a
lowpowered
beam
is
aimed
across
the
road
at
a
degree
angle
to
the
direction
of
traffic
and
a
picture
is
taken
of
vehicles
which
the
radar
unit
determines
to
have
been
in
violation
of
the
speed
limit
tickets
are
mailed
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
because
of
the
low
power
and
the
degree
angle
many
people
believe
that
a
radar
detector
cannot
give
reasonable
warning
of
a
ka
band
radar
unit
although
some
manufacturers
of
radar
detectors
have
added
such
capability
anyway
the
number
of
locales
where
photoradar
is
in
use
is
limited
and
some
question
the
legality
of
such
units

learn
what

look

keep

where
they
are

at
all

questions
q
what
are
understeer
and
oversteer
a
understeer
and
oversteer
are
terms
describing
the
behaviour
of
a
car
while
cornering
near
the
limit
limit
of
adhesion
that
is
most
drivers
do
not
normally
drive
hard
enough
for
these
terms
to
be
descriptive
of
the
situations
they
encounter
simply
put
they
tell
whether
the
car
wants
to
go
straight
in
a
corner
steer
less
or
understeer
or
it
wants
to
turn
more
in
a
corner
oversteer
understeer
is
commonly
designed
into
most
production
cars
so
that
untrained
drivers
inadvertantly
traveling
too
fast
wont
get
into
trouble
understeer
may
also
be
induced
by
using
too
much
throttle
in
a
corner
oversteer
is
designed
into
some
more
performance
oriented
cars
it
may
be
induced
by
lifting
on
the
throttle
trailing
throttle
oversteer
or
tto
in
extreme
cases
lifting
on
the
throttle
may
induce
so
much
oversteer
that
the
car
reacts
by
fishtailing
or
spinning
some
technical
details
in
a
corner
at
speed
the
tires
on
the
car
will
develop
what
are
called
slip
angles
the
slip
angle
is
the
angular
difference
between
the
direction
that
the
car
is
traveling
and
the
direction
that
the
steering
wheel
is
directing
the
car
to
travel
in
understeer
the
front
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
rear
wheels
in
oversteer
the
rear
wheels
have
a
greater
slip
angle
than
the
front
wheels
q
what
is
a
revmatched
downshift
a
when
downshifting
the
engine
must
be
rotating
faster
in
the
lower
gear
than
it
was
in
the
higher
gear
however
during
a
downshift
normally
you
declutch
and
lift
your
foot
from
the
throttle
so
the
revs
drop
rather
than
increase
in
revmatched
downshift
you
blip
the
throttle
before
reengaging
the
clutch
so
that
the
engine
will
already
be
up
to
the
new
speed
this
results
in
a
much
smoother
and
faster
downshift
q
what
does
heelandtoe
mean
a
heelandtoe
is
a
technique
used
to
do
a
revmatched
downshift
while
braking
this
is
normally
challenging
because
you
need
the
right
foot
for
both
the
brake
and
throttle
it
is
called
heelandtoe
because
you
use
one
end
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
other
on
the
throttle
to
match
revs
for
the
downshift
in
many
modern
cars
this
is
a
misnomer
often
you
must
use
the
ball
of
the
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
side
on
the
throttle
note
that
some
race
car
drivers
will
skip
the
clutch
and
just
use
the
left
foot
on
the
brake
and
the
right
foot
on
the
throttle
accomplishing
the
same
thing
q
what
is
doubleclutch
downshifting
a
while
your
right
foot
is
doing
the
above
your
left
foot
can
do
one
of
three
things
nothing
declutch
once
or
declutch
twice
the
reason
for
declutching
twice
is
to
match
the
speeds
of
the
two
shafts
in
the
transmission
to
the
speed
of
the
engine
this
is
usually
coupled
with
revmatching
so
that
while
the
engine
is
in
neutral
and
the
clutch
engaged
the
throttle
is
blipped
and
both
shafts
of
the
transmission
speed
up
the
procedure
is
as
follows
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
neutral
engage
clutch
match
revs
declutch
move
gearshift
lever
to
next
lower
gear
engage
clutch
this
sounds
like
a
lot
of
work
but
with
practice
it
becomes
natural
the
problem
that
doubleclutching
solves
is
normally
the
function
of
the
synchronizers
within
the
gearbox
in
transmissions
without
synchros
or
with
very
worn
synchros
doubleclutching
makes
it
much
easier
to
shift
basically
if
you
doubleclutch
well
you
are
not
using
the
synchros
at
all
this
is
generally
unnecessary
on
street
cars
with
synchros
in
good
condition
q
what
do
the
numbers
for
acceleration
from
mile
skidpad
and
slalom
times
in
the
auto
magazines
really
mean
may
they
be
compared
a
in
short
not
as
much
as
the
magazines
want
you
to
believe
and
almost
never
in
more
detail
the
acceleration
numbers
and
mile
times
in
the
us
may
be
vaguely
compared
as
long
as
they
all
come
from
the
same
source
testing
procedures
vary
so
much
from
magazine
to
magazine
that
comparing
a
road
track
number
to
a
car
driver
number
is
quite
pointless
keep
in
mind
too
that
the
same
variation
applies
from
driver
to
driver
on
the
street
the
driver
is
a
major
often
the
major
part
of
the
equation
skidpads
vary
and
even
if
they
didnt
skidpad
figures
are
really
only
tests
of
the
stickiness
of
the
stock
tires
they
change
radically
when
tire
compounds
change
do
not
make
any
assumptions
about
the
comparative
handling
of
say
two
sports
sedans
based
on
skidpad
numbers
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
skidpads
are
without
value
however
skidpads
are
an
excellent
educational
tool
at
driving
schools
they
are
simply
of
limited
value
in
the
comparison
of
anything
except
tires
slalom
times
are
slightly
more
useful
they
test
some
small
parts
of
the
automobiles
transient
response
however
they
are
also
heavily
influenced
by
the
stock
rubber
on
the
car
and
they
do
not
test
many
corners
of
the
cars
envelope
they
do
not
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
before
making
a
buying
decision
for
example
they
dont
tell
you
what
the
rear
end
of
the
car
will
do
on
a
road
which
suddenly
goes
offcamber
when
a
car
has
an
adjustable
suspension
these
tests
are
usually
done
in
the
sport
setting
which
may
be
quite
unsuitable
for
daily
driving
the
list
of
caveats
could
go
on
for
page
after
page
q
my
buddy
claims
that
wide
tires
dont
make
any
difference
according
to
his
freshman
physics
textbook
and
that
you
cant
ever
accelerate
or
corner
at
more
than
does
he
know
what
hes
talking
about
a
in
short
he
hasnt
got
a
clue
in
more
detail
the
equations
for
friction
used
in
freshman
physics
textbooks
presume
that
the
surfaces
are
smooth
dry
and
nondeformable
none
of
which
properly
apply
to
tire
traction
except
in
the
case
of
a
stone
cold
tire
on
dry
pavement
which
is
far
below
its
proper
operating
temperature
pavement
is
never
smooth
it
is
always
irregular
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
tires
which
are
not
really
dry
and
solid
as
rubber
is
a
substance
which
in
its
natural
form
is
liquid
and
which
has
only
been
coerced
into
a
semblance
of
solidity
by
chemical
magic
deform
to
match
the
surface
of
the
pavement
which
a
vehicle
is
traveling
over
in
a
tire
at
operating
temperature
grip
is
actually
generated
by
shear
stresses
inside
the
deformed
rubber
and
not
by
anything
even
remotely
resembling
friction
in
the
freshman
physics
sense
of
the
term
the
colder
a
tire
is
relative
to
its
operating
temperature
the
closer
its
behaviour
will
be
to
the
traditional
concept
of
friction
if
much
hotter
than
the
its
proper
operating
temperature
the
more
likely
the
possibility
of
some
part
of
the
tire
actually
reverting
to
liquid
which
is
mostly
like
to
happen
deep
in
the
tread
causing
characteristic
blisters
and
chunking
this
latter
though
is
almost
completely
unlikely
to
happen
in
normal
street
driving
so
unless
youre
a
competition
driver
or
do
a
lot
of
high
speed
track
driving
dont
worry
about
it
because
tire
traction
is
completely
out
of
the
domain
of
simple
friction
it
does
not
obey
the
freshman
physics
equation
at
all
thus
dragsters
accelerate
at
more
than
and
race
cars
corner
and
brake
at
more
than
because
simple
friction
does
not
apply
it
is
actually
possible
for
different
sized
contact
patches
to
generate
differing
amounts
of
grip
an
actual
analysis
of
tire
behavior
would
require
techniques
such
as
finite
element
analysis
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
mechanism

first
of
all
to

anywhere
you
need
to
either
be
a
sysadmin
or
have
some
measure
of
assistance
from
your

it
is
also
important
that
you
have
reasonably
good

connectivity
if
it
seems
like
you
get
everything
several
days
after
anyone
else
or
that
you
have
trouble
getting

your

is
a

package
named

due

decrease

fatal

intentionally
blocking

certainly
not

you
decribe
usually
either
traffic
is

building
and
i
have
to
deal
with
this
fact
of
life
or
i
wait
to
a
slow
passer
to
complete
their
pass
and
make
way
for
the
pack
to
clear
if
someone
decides
then
to
pull
up
on
my

signal
my

move
to

and
do
so
at
the
first
opportunity

will
open

it
had

shine
that
i
remember
from
a

when
i
bought
it
several

ago
i
took
my

to
the

for
some
work
as
an
added
bonus
they
washed
my

unfortunately
whoever
washed
it
either
didnt
get
the

is
black
the

of
the

is

completely
clean

dried

he
used

is
a
haze

fine
scratches
that
arent
really
visible
until
the
light
hits
the
roof
at
a
particular
angle
i
am
to
put
it

peeved
about
this
do
i
have
any
chance
of
getting
the

to
do
something
about
this
my
guess
is
no
is
there
any
product
on
the
market
that
provides
a
solution
to
this
problem

am
i
faced
with

im
wondering
if
anybody
else
out
there
is
a
clutchless
shifter
ive
been
doing
it
my
self
over
miles
on
my
current
toyota
truck
ive
got
over
ive
heard
people
talk
about
how
doing
this
can
damage
a
transmission
my
experiences
suggest
otherwise
what
techniques
do
you
use
yeah
i
dont
use
the
clutch
all
the
time
either
ive
done
it
with
fords
bmw
datsun
and
chevy
and
it
works
fine
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
that
it
would
damage
the
tranny
essentially
you
are
just
doing
what
the
synchros
do
anyhow
match
the
engine
speed
with
the
tranny
speed
and
slip
it
into
gear
on
some
old
pieces
of
junk
i
drove
the
transmission
was
so
worn
that
pumping
the
clutch
was
the
only
way
to
shift
except
clutchless
to
date
ive
driven
rabbits
datsuns
comets
fords
a
chevy
some
where
harder
than
others
to
shift
but
generally
the
higher
the
milage
the
smoother
quicker
easier
they
where
to
shift
my
technique
is
to
ease
back
off
the
throttle
and
at
the
same
time
gently
wrist
back
on
the
shift
lever
if
for
some
reason
i
miss
the
shift
window
i
lightly
press
the
accelerator
try
agian
ive
found
that
clutchless
shifting
is
eaiserquicker
at
high
rpms
i
also
skip
gears
some
times
using
sounds
about
right
i
usually
slip
it
out
during
throttledown
and
then
blip
the
throttle
and
wait
until
it
feels
like
things
are
right
usually
about
a
second
and
then
slip
it

this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
yes
nobody
is
watching
them
if
they
get
caught
there
is
no
punishment
at
all
in
the
old
days
such
behaviour
would
be
rewarded
with
a
whipping
with
a
goodsized
belt
and
then
taken
into
some
hospital
to
see
first
hand
what
kind
of
damage
such
accidents
cause
of
course
this
doesnt
happen
any
more
that
whipping
would
probably
save
the
kids
life
by
teaching
him
some
respect
for
others
a
person
with
that
little
respect
would
inevitably
wind
up
dead
early
anyway
the
problem
is
creeping
gradualism
if
you
put
a
frog
into
hot
water
he
just
jumps
out
but
if
you
put
him
into
cold
water
and
then
everso
gradually
heat
it
the
frog
will
cook
this
is
what
the
entertainment
industry
and
lack
of
religious
moral
and
educational
standards
in
our
modern
north
american
society
have
done
to
us
over
the
years
now
that
we
are
about
to
be
cooked
we
may
have
woken
up
too
late
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
and
the
education
system
and
the
religious
leaders
arent
doing
much
about
it
either
with
both
parents
working
in
this
society
where
is
the
stabilizing
influence
at
home
latchkey
children
are
everywhere
and
these
latchkey
kids
can
watch
whatever
rotten
videos
and
listen
to
whatever
violent
hatepromoting
music
and
videos
they
like
because
no
one
is
home
to
stop
it
this
day
and
age
when
there
is
about
times
more
things
to
learn
than
when
i
went
to
school
our
answer
to
this
increased
knowledge
is
shorter
school
hours
and
more
leisure
time
i
say
keep
the
kids
in
school
longer
feed
them
good
food
and
teach
them
something
and
when
they
get
home
have
a
parent
there
to
interact
and
monitor
them
there
is
a
very
old
and
now
forgotten
proverb
a
child
left
on
his
own
will
bring
a
parent
to
grief
daycare
systems
are
not
the
answer
this
is
just
shifting
the
parents
own
responsibilities
off
on
someone
else
to
whom
its
not
a

am
beyond

group
but
i
have
an
experience
a
few
years
ago
that
might
be
interesting
to
you
i
owned
a
toyota
celica
gt
i
decided
to
buy
myself
a
gift
a
more
exotic
car
front
runners
included
the
toyota
supra
turbo
and
the
porsche
model
years
i
narrowed
it
down
to
those
two
i
liked
the
simplicity
and
handling
and
snob
appeal
too
of
driving
a
porsche
the
supra
turbo
was
less
money
and
had
more
features
and
performance
almost
a
personal
luxury
car
it
had
better
acceleration
and
a
higher
top
speed
than
the
i
was
almost
ready
to
give
in
to
a
buying
impulse
for
the
but
i
decided
to
stop
by
my
insurance
agents
office
on
the
way
i
asked
about
what
would
happen
to
my
rate
with
either
car
if
you
buy
the
supra
your
rate
classification
will
be
the
same
as
the
celica
the
celica
was
considered
a
subcompact
and
for
that
year
was
rated
as
one
of
the
safest
cars
with
a
slight
increase
because
the
car
will
be
years
newer
our
lowerrisk
division
will
continue
to
handle
your
account
if
you
buy
the
porsche
well
have
to
change
you
to
the
standard
higher
rate
company
and
your
rate
will
double
and
if
you
go
with
a
its
another
story
again
well
cover
the
rest
of
this
year
but
cancel
you
after
that
but
the
supra
is
much
faster
than
the
and
the
is
actually
faster
than
the
standard
that
doenst
make
sense
thats
what
the
book
says
we
dont
insure
corvettes
either
for
some
reason
the
underwriters
consider
supras
and
their
drivers
as
very
traditional
and
conservative
i
eventually
went
with
the
supra
for
a
number
of
reasons
the
porsche
dealer
had
a
nice
salesman
to
get
me
interested
but
a
tough
highpressure
guy
in
the
back
room
at
equal
monthly
payments
it
would
have
taken
a
year
longer
to
pay
for
the
porsche
plus
its
higher
insurance
i
concluded
that
the
high
insurance
was
related
to
probability
of
auto
theft
everyones
entitled
to
my
opinion
goldbergoasysdtnavymil

thing
that
makes
a
huge
difference
in
mass
is
the
town
you
live
in
im
personally
in
one
of
the
best
towns
within
reasonable
distance
of
boston
if
i
moved
to
the
absolute
best
it
would
go
down
to
about
if
i
moved
to
the
worst
it
would
be
also
one
accident
and
a
couple
of
tickets
would
probably
add
another
rv
i
have
a
mitsubishi
eclipse

awd
am
years
old
and
have
no

that
went
on
my
record
i
live
in
illinois
just
outside
of
chicago
and
pay
a
year
with
full
coverage
at
state
farm
i
did
get
a
small
discount
because
of
my
alarm
a
year
i
only
live
miles
from
chicago
but
if
i
actually
lived
in
the
city
the
price
would
be
about
a
year
im
over
but
in
case
youre
interested
anyway
im
insuring
a
sho
for
month
thats
property
with
deductible
glass
and
towing
state
farm
unless
you
are
under
or
have
been
driving
for
less
than
years
i
think
you
are
being
seriously
ripped
off
i
dont
have
one
of
the
performance
cars
you
listed
but
if
your
record
is
clean
then
you
should
not
be
paying
over
did
you
try
calling
all
the
insurance
dealers
you
could
find
although
rates
are
supposed
to
be
standardized
ive
found
that
most
places
i
initially
call
give
me
some
ridiculously
high
quote
and
finaly
i
hit
one
that
is
much
lower
also
i
have
changed
insurance
companies
when
the
rate
went
up
at
renewal
no
accidents
tickets
car
gets
older
to
maintain
a
low
rate
you
always
have
to
be
careful
when
it
comes
to
insurance

hello
i
am
looking
to
slightly
increase
the
performance
of
my
honda
civic
si
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
suggest
upgrades
that
were
not
too
drastic
i
thought
that
one
of
the
easiest
upgrades
would
be
a
new
header
does
anyone
know
what
kind
of
increase
that
the
header
would
give
me
i
think
i
would
check
with
jackson
racing
for
the
part
are
there
any
other
comparines
would
make
honda
parts
are
there
any
other
small
changes
that
can
be
easily
made
and
wont
screw
up
the
car
things
like
new
injectors
new
fuel
injection
chip
etc
i
would
welcome
any
suggestions
of
small
changes
that
would
make
a
difference
i
dont
really
want
to
change
the
cam
etc
because
i
have
heard
that
it
would
be
much
harder
on
the
engine

re

an
excellent

can
be
found
in
the
subaru
legacy
it
switches
to
sport
mode
when
the
electronics
figure
it
not
when
the
driver
sets
the
switch
which
is
the
proper
way
to
do
it

what

entail
several
things
revving

or
to
the
rev
limiter
in
the
case
of
the
legacy
delayed
upshifts
ie
if
you
lift
off
briefly
it
will
remain
in
the
low
gear
this
is
handy
if
you
are

corners
and

to
do

rather
than
the
position
of
the

modern
electronics
can
measure
this
very
easily
and
switch
to
sport
mode
this
is
wonderful
if
you
want
to
charge
through
a
green
light
about
to
turn
red
my
audi
senses
this
very
well
and
can
downshift
on
as
little
as
half
throttle
if
my
right
foot
is
fast
enough
also
i
think
that
a
smart
automatic
can
deliver
better
gas
mileage
than
a
dumb
driver
with
a
stick
all
else
being
equal
remember
that
the
idea
of
a
stick
being
more
economical
than
an
automatic
makes
a
big
assumption
that
the
driver
is
smart
enough
to
know
what
gear
to
use
for
each
situation
how
many
times
have
you
ridden
with
an
inattentive
driver
cruising
on
the
highway
at
in
gear
of
a
speed
how
many
of
people
who
drive
manuals
really
know
what
the
best
gear
to
use
is
for
every
conceivable
situation
im
sure
there
will
be
some
who
know
but
i
suspect
that
a
chip
controlled
automatic
with
all
possible
scenarioratio
combinations
stored
in
rom
is
likely
to
do
better
i
can
also
say
that
all
my
previous
assumptions
were
proved
wrong
after
i
got
a
car
with
instantaneous
mpg
readout
high
gear
low
revs
and
wide
open
throttle
is
more
economical
than
low
gear
high
revs
and
small
throttle
opening
the
explanation
is
quite
simple
if
one
sits
down
to
think
about
it

not
that
obvious

re

bigots

you
write
if
ayrton
senna
can
drive
a
racecar
with
fully
automatic
transmission
it
cant
be
half
bad
this
mclaren
autotransmission
i
still
think
its
only
half
auto
but
you
may
be
right
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
gm
chrysler
volvo
or
whatever
auto
transmission
its
a
normal
manual
transmission
gearbox
with
clutch
and
all
but
there
are
servo
motors
which
do
the
shifting
that
means
there
is
no
power
loss
in
the
drivetrain
if
you
take
out
minimal
mechanical
friction
and
the
samiauto
transmissions
ferrari
williams
mclaren
dont
tell
you
when
to
shift
either
however
these
transmissions
share
an
important
disadvantage
with
your
stock
autotrannie
they
are
expensive
as
long
as
these
servoshifted
gearboxes
arent
available
on
normal
cars
im
gonna
stick
with
my
manual
i
just
cant
see
an
advantage
to
make
up
for
two
grand
i
lose
in
this
deal
and
the
loss
in
mileage
and
power
except
maybe
in
real
heavy
traffic
but
then
i
drive
mostly
on
the
autobahn
and
country
roads
anyway
theres
no
point
in
making
a
religion
out

this
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
a
few
technical
facts
and

theres

blip

about

how

corresponding

i
am
currently
working
with
the
local
engineers
who
are
making
sure
we
are
compliant
with
the
regulations
the
trouble
with
regulations
is
that
they
only
tell
you
what
you
are
no
longer
permitted
to
do
not
what
you
should
do
instead
i
think
the
cause
of
the
new
regulations
is
the
montreal
protocol
which
has
a
definite
cfcphaseout
schedule
of
course
the
cause
of
the
montreal
protocol
was
all
the
research
done
on
the
causes
of
the
ozone
depletion
problem
someone
asked
earlier
about
why
the
governments
were
working
so
fast
to
ban
the
ozonedepleting
cfc
chemicals
and
not
gasolines
and
other
greenhousegasproducing
compounds
the
greenhouse
effect
produced
by
infraredtrapping
gasses
like
and
methane
and
the
ozonehole
problem
produced
by
longlived
chlorinecontaining
molecules
are
not
the
same
thing
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
do
something
about
not
using
the
cfcs
chlorofluorocarbons
than
it
is
to
stop
producing
and
methane
which
are
natural
byproducts
of
combustion
and
of
living
animal
organisms
planting
more
trees
and
not
destroying
so
many
existing
trees
would
help
the
greenhousegas
problem
but
would
do
nothing

i

i
had

about
an
hour
before
the

could
get

when
i
finally
got

everything
went

numbers
he
then
discovered

they
had

then
said
he
needed

i
said
we
had

i
wasnt

any
more

a

i
bought
a

ford
bronco
which
has
since
been
stolen
and
few
weeks
after
i
paid
and
took
delivery
they
sent
a

telling

they
goofed
and
miscalculated
the
license
renewal
by
and
that
i
need
to
send
in
a

to
avoid
further
delay
in
the
processing

the
thing
is
i
had
already
received
the
pink
slip
from
the

so
i
ignored
it
i
received
another

and
then
the
phone
calls
started
coming
first
from
the
finance
guy
and
then
from
the
general
manager
both
hounding
me
for
the
extra
money
they
left
me
alone
once
i
told
them
i
already
had
the
paperwork
and
pointed
out
the
clause
in
the
contract
that
stated
that
the
final
price
was
just
that
final
afterall
they
wouldnt
budge
if
i
had
told
them
i
wanted
another
off
after
the

had
been
signed
right
i
told
them
not
to
call
again
and
that
i
would
not
do

in

they
didnt
seem

a
used
ford
at
a
toyota

i
had
a
much
better

buying

about

it
certainly
pays

buy
a

on

it

were

i
kept

i
would

honda

brake
problem
my
honda
accord
just
hit
the
magic
mile
mark
and
now
all
sorts
of
things
are
beginning
to
go
bad
the
latest
problem
i
am
experiencing
is
with
my
brakes
they
still
stop
the
car
fine
but
once
i
am
stopped
completely
my
brake
pedal
will
sink
another
or
inches
all
by
itself
if
feels
really
strange
and
i
am
worried
my
brakes
will
quit
working
one
of
these
days
i
checked
my
brake
fluid
and
the
reservoir
was
full
but
the
fluid
itself
looked
really
dirty
like
dirty
oil
i
called
my
mechanic
and
he
told
me
i
need
a
new
brake
master
cylinder
which
will
cost
me
a
whopping
i
was
just
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
has
experienced
this
sort
of
thing
if
so
is
my
mechanic
being
honest
or
do
i
simply
need
to
have
my
brakes
bled
and
new
fluid
put
in
any
help
you
could
provide
would

after

many

im

i
am
trying

make
plans
of
how
to
spend
all
this
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
on
a
sports
car
of
some
kind
after
thinking
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drops
and
buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a
corvette
stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
early
for
around
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycle
and
what
are
good
prices
also
what
would
insurance
look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
in
my
area
denver
if
you
look
around
alittle
you
can
get
an
for
or
less
not
much
less
you
said
your
not
looking
to
go
fast
they
are
a
really
nice
car
just
not
real
powerful
in
addition
to
restricted
mileage
many
classic
insurance
carriers
also
require
that
the

be
garaged

what
the

is
a

modified

essentially
the

reallife
experience
with

when
youre
invoking
oversteer
of
course
something
i
personally
avoid
doing
on

highway
and
stopping
power
is
inadequate
even
from
lots
of
accelleration
but
the
rest
of
the
car
is
not
up
to
par
i
picked
the
porsche
example
because
they
are
designed
with
speed
in
mind
it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
several
mercedes
or
audi
models
all
of
these
cars
are
fairly
expensive

so
are
the
parts
that
make
them
drivable
at
high
speed
this
should
be
elementary
there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
about
europe
since
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledge
is
admittedly
secondhand
but
i
believe
the
following
to
be
true
drivers
are
much
better
disciplined
in
europe
than
they
are
here
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying

theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a

of

owners

i
could

what

where

what

what
one
thing
that
everyone
is
forgetting
in
this
argument
over
the
pricing
of
the

is
the

this
makes
the

price
low
in

to
the
inflated

of

in

one
could
dicker
several
hundred
dollars
off
the

at

hereabouts
i
dont

i
would
be
much
more
worried
about

other

than
the

isnt

not

on

on

i
had
stopped
in

for
the

in

somewhere
in

about
youths
were
disturbing

come
out

walked

vanished

immediately
packedup

often

solid
that
if
a
few
people
yeild
to
the
moron
who
is
impatiently
riding

the

at

viola
no

granted
the
situation
here
does
not
apply
to

i
have
observed
this

regularly

six

eight
sets
of

side

bunched
up

the
people
who
refuse

are
just
as
annoying
as
the

in

i
agree
that
if
traffic
is
all
blocked
up
and
you
want
to
pass
you
might
not
feel
like
moving
over
for
someone
behind
you
because
you
dont
want
to
give
them
that
one
carlength
when
they
should
just
wait
like
you
are
but
if
youre
one
of
those
people
that
just
sits
behind
the
person
and
doesnt
flash
them
with
the
high
beams

pull
left

flash
them

ride
their

otherwise
tell

youre
not

then
get
the

out

i

hate
it

you
flash
someone
at

they

after

what

me
upset
is
that

in

anymore
in

also
this
is

another
way
mechanics

can
ripoff

also
i
was
reading
that
the

is
not

that
it
would
cost
upto
a

a

with
the
old

although
it
is
important
to
consider
the
environment
i
think
the
sudden
ban
is
a
slap
in
the
face
for
the
consumer
why
is
it
that
the
consumer
should
have
to
pay
for
the
retrofit
the
auto
companies
should
have
seen
this
coming
also
why
is
it
that
the
governments
of
the

were
so
quick
in
banning

yet
so
slow
in
banning

in
my
opinion
gasoline
is
just
as
hazardous
as
anything
else
why
cant
they
start
proposing
bans
on

switch

natural

some

the

not

yes
when
i

i
think
schoolbus
motor
in
my
mind
the

should
be
fitted
with
a

so
it
just
isnt

check
out
your
local
junkyard

find
it
astonishing
the

not

for
poor
brakes
in

ford
should
at

standardize

rear
brakes
for
all
i
picked
the
porsche
example
because
they
are
designed
with
speed
in

it
didnt
have
to
be
the
it
could
have
been
the
much
cheaper
or
one
of
several
mercedes

audi
models
all
of
these
cars
are
fairly
expensive
but
so
are
the
parts
that
make
them
drivable
at
high
speed
this
should
be
elementary
there
are
a
few
things
to
keep
in
mind
about
europe
since
you
brought
it
up
my
autobahn
knowledge
is
admittedly
secondhand
but
i
believe
the
following
to
be
true
drivers
are
much
better
disciplined
in
europe
than
they
are
here
true
of
northern
europe
latin
countries
are
something
else
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
kindof
true
remember
they
were
build
by
adolf
in
the
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
yes
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
autobahn
is
the
german
word
for
freeway
other
countries
have
different
names
for
loose
equivalents
autostrada
autoroute
motorway
etc
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying
to
me
theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
europe
did
seem
on
the
brink
of
a
limit
it
hasnt
passed
as
far
as
i
know
typical
speeds
in
western
europe
are
much
higher
than
the
us
law
enforcement
is
negligible
in
my
experience
comapred
to
the
us
as
there
is
no
revenue
enhancement
motivation
the
things
you
really
notice
are
the
higher
speed
differentials
and
the
more
professional
attitude
to
driving
you
just
never
see
two
cars
running
parallel
at
mph
oblivious
to
all
around
them
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owners
doing
nearly
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
some
people
youre
wrong
gtis
go
this
fast
just
kind

noisy
not
the
ideal
autobahn
car
a
lot
of
times
you
see
cars
being

the

foot
on
the
floor
how
do
i
know
when
youre
not

ground

in

you
have
no
respect
for
their
own
lives
if
something
happens
at
youre
dead
but
the
same
goes
for
much
over
driving
at
high
speed
forces
you
to
concentrate
i
feel
much
safer
driving
on
the
autobahn
than

because
most
people
seem

the

the

admittedly
negligible

an

less

was
over

the

note
that
the

did
beat
the
i
dont

as
far
as
the

goes
rest
assured
that
the
street
prices
for
the

and
maybe
even
the

will
be
lesser
than
that
of
the

youre

price
comparisons
ive

the

exit
to

my

suddenly
screamed

something
large
hit
the
side

we
slowed
down

after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to

she
did
get

and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock
but
i
never
saw
him
we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have
killed
her
the
police
are
looking
for
the
guy
but
in
all
likelyhood
he
is
gone
i
am
a

knock
on

it
was

i

someone
threw
a
rock
of
an

and
hit
our

im
sure
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
to

quickly
to

who
did
it
we
figured
it
was
kids
reported
it
and
left
a
couple
of
years

it
happend
again
and
killed
a
guy
at
my

he
was
in

midfourties
and
left
behind
a

turned
out
there
was

the

then
brought
in
the

on
duty
who
proceeded
to
give
me
a
hard
time
i
reminded
him
that
i
was
the
customer
and
i
didnt
think
i
should
be
treated
like
that
and
that
if
he
didnt
back
off
he
could
forget
the
whole
deal
he
made
some
smart
remark
so
i
told
him
where
he
could
stick
it
snatched
back
my
check
and
left
needless
to
say
they
were
not
pleased
by
the
turn
of
events
thats
nothing
when
a
friend
of
mine
went
shopping
for
a
small
sedan
a
few
years
ago
she
brought
me
along
as
a
token
male
so
the
salespeople
wouldnt
give
her
the
bimbo
treatment
her
first
choice
was
a
mazda
and
second
choice
was
a
nissan
sentra
we
went
to
a
mazda
dealership
and
described
what
we
wanted
we
started
negotiating
on
the
price
and
the
salesdroid
kept
playing
the
let
me
run
this
price
by
the
sales
manager
after
playing
the
good
salesman
bad
salesman
game
we
finally
told
him
that
if
he
didnt
have
the
authority
to
negotiate
a
price
perhaps
we
should
be
speaking
directly
to
someone
who
did
he
brought
in
the
sales
manager
who
proceeded
to
dick
us
around
with
every
trick
in
the
book
read
remar
suttons
dont
get
taken
every
time
for
a
list
finally
after
playing
a
few
more
rounds
of
youll
have
to
work
with
us
on
this
price
also
known
as
each
time
you
come
up
a
thousand
dollars
well
come
down
ten
the
salesmanager
gave
a
signal
to
his
two
sales
cronies
stood
up
and
said
well
we
cant
come
down
any
more
so
i
guess
we
cant
help
you
and
they
trouped
out
of
the
room
leaving
us
sitting
in
the
salesmans
office
all
by
ourselves
hmm
id
read
that
sleazy
salesmen
sometimes
bug
their
own
offices
so
they
can
leave
and
listen
in
on
couples
discussing
the
sales
offer
and
i
mentioned
this
aloud
to
my
friend
while
we
were
sitting
there
wondering
why
they
would
leave
us
in
the
office
instead
of
showing
us
to
the
door
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
i
picked
up
the
phone
on
the
desk
and
called
another
mazda
dealership
asked
for
a
salesman
and
began
discussing
what
kind
of
price
they
would
consider
a
few
sentences
into
the
conversation
mr
salesmanager
broke
into
the
line
and
began
telling
me
how
rude
he
thought
it
was
that
i
would
call
another
dealership
from
his
phone
i
said
that
since
hed
announced
that
our
business
was
over
he
shouldnt
care
and
every
time
i
tried
to
talk
to
the
other
sales
guy
the
sales
manager
would
drown
out
our
voices
with
his
own
how
did
he
know
that
i
was
using
the
phone
anyway
finally
i
hung
up
and
we
headed
out
of
the
showroom
sales
manager
and
cronies
come
out
of
a
little
unmarked
room
and
he
begins
to
berate
us
again
we
say
that
we
wont
bother
him
anymore
were
going
next
door
to
the
nissan
dealership
then
comes
the
part
i
wish
i
could
have
videotaped
as
we
go
out
the
front
door
the
sales
manager
shouts
across
the
entire
showroom
customers
and
all
go
ahead
you
deserve
to
buy
a
nissan
so
my
friend
bought
a
sentra
just
so
the
guilty
wont
go
unpunished
ill
mention
that
the
sales
managers
name
was
gary
tusone
from
his
manner
his
refusal
to
come
down
to
a
reasonable
price
and
his
anger
at
the
end
my
guess
is
that
he
had
bet
our
original
salesman
who
was
a
young
novice
that
hed
be
able
to
get
at
least
x
dollars
out
of
us
and
he
was
steamed
that
we
wouldnt
fall

his
slimy
tricks

have
more

the
damage
was
generally
quite

imho
social
considerations
are
probably
the
strongest
influence
here
possibly
more
so
than
any
difference

social

often
affect
the
type

car
thats
bought

the
situations
the
car
is
used
in
and
the
type
of
car
and
driving
situations
have
a
major
effect
on
accident
risk
thus
if
society
expects
you
to
buy
a
mustang
and
race
it
on
the
street
youre
more
likely
to
do
it

our

lets
get

here
guys
dont
drag
race
becuase
there
expected
too
we
do
it
becuase
its

and
we
find
out
whose
car
is
faster
guys
drive
different
than
women
becuase
there
men
when
a
driver
is
driving
unusually
i
can
usually
figure
out
if
it
is
a
male
or
female
driver
without
looking
at
the
driver
social
influences
may
give
a

more

a

that

i
was
taking
an
offramp
exit
to
another
interstate
and
my

suddenly
screamed
and
something
large
hit
the
side
of
my
truck
we
slowed
down
but
after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to
the
police
station
she
did
get
a
good
look
at
the
guy
and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock
but
i
never
saw
him
we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have
killed
her

are
looking
for
the
guy

in

likelyhood
he
is
gone

am
sorry
to
report

in

it

sport
for

to
drop
concrete
blocks
from
the
overpasses
onto
the
freeway
several
persons
were
killed
when
said
blocks
came
through
their

many

they
have
made
it

to
loiter
on
such

if
that
would

its
a
big
aftermarket
business
almost
no
cars
come
from
the
factory
with
vynal
any
more
and
any
fake
convertible
job
definitely
came
from
some
aftermarket
place
what
amazes
me
is
how
much
people
are
willing
to
pay
for
bad
taste
how
about
those
really
ugly
fake
wheel
compartments
stuck
onto
the

or
side
or
both

of
some

some
of

arent

if
youre
talking
about
the
continental
kit
named
after
the
lincoln
continental
the
first
car
to
sport
one
i
personally
would
love
to
have
a
tbird
with
a
continental
kit
and
the
supercharged
that
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
cars
ever
built
imho
james
the
continental
may
have
been
the
first
modern
era
auto
to
mount
the
spare
on
the
rear
of
the
car
but
it
was
hardly
the
first
car
to
sport
one
various
mounting
techniques
for
rear
mounting
the
spare
were
quite
common
in
early
automobiles
both
us
and
foreign
ken
franklin
they
say
theres
a
heaven
for
people
who
wait
ama
and
some
say
its
better
but
i
say
it
aint

rather
laugh

re

was
christ
another
dealer
service
scam
while
not
exactly
a
service
incident
i
had
a
similar
experience
recently
when
i
bought
a
new
truck
i
had
picked
out
the
vehicle
i
wanted
and
after
a
little
haggling
we
agreed
on
a
price
i
wrote
them
a
check
for
the
down
payment
plus
tax
and
license
and
told
them
id
be
back
that
evening
to
pick
up
the
truck
when
i
returned
i
had
to
wait
about
an
hour
before
the
finance
guy
could
get
to
me
when
i
finally
got
in
there
everything
went
smoothly
until
he
started
adding
up
the
numbers
he
then
discovered
that
they
had
miscalculated
the
tax
license
by
about
this
seems
to
be
a
popular
scam
with
dealers
last
month
my
brother
bought
a
new
audi
series
quatro
from
a
local
dealer
they
came
back
with
the
final
price
tax
and
all
and
he
added
it
up
for
himself
there
happened
to
be
an
extra
tagged
on
under
the
tax
part
he
pointed
out
their
error
and
asked
them
to
rethink
their
addition
they
came

i
am
looking

this

for
right
now
the
car
has
km

about

on
it
a
typical
mileage
for
cars
seem
to
be
about
km
or
about

the
seller
just
informed
me
that
when
he
brought
the
car
in
for
certification
he
was
told
that
the
front
break
pads
and
the
exhausts
had
to
be
replaced
to
meet
the
legal
standards
he
said
he
will
replace
the
components
before
selling
the

to

being
copmletely

i
dont

what
this

is

about

typical
for
replacing
the
above

or
is
this
an

that
the
car
was
abused
would
other
things
break
down
or
have
to
be
replaced
soon
the
seller
told
me
that
he
used
the
car
on
the
highway
a
lot
but
i
dont
know
how
to
verify
this
ive
seen
the
paint
chipped
away
in
tiny
dots
in
the
front
edge
of
the

though
although
the
maxima
is
an
excellent
car
and
the
car
is
very
clean
and
well
kept
its
currently
out

a

will

left
and

to

also

the

all
and
the
was
way
down
the
list
except
for
braking
i
just
looked
at
that
article
first
of
all
this
summary
is
inaccurate
of
cars
the
was
right
behind
these
mentioned
and
the
suzuki
swift
as
has
been
pointed
out
it
was
a
semisilly
comparison
the
saturn
was
at
least
cheaper
than
the
and
escort
admittedly
negligible
but
an
issue
and
less
than
the
honda
the
stated
goal
was
a
base
under
the
honda
was
over
while
the
at
the
same
price
was
excluded
in
other
words
they
let
the
best
honda
play
but
not
the
best
saturn
note
that
the
saturn
did
beat
the
i
dont
know
about
the
car
comparison
but
as
far
as
the
price
goes
rest
assured
that
the
street
prices
for
the
and
escort
and
maybe
even
the
honda
will
be
lesser
than
that
of
the
saturn
youre
talking
about
all
price
comparisons
ive
seen
are
based
on
msrp
and
of
course
the
saturn
dealer
will
sell
the
car
for
sticker
price
whereas
the
others
will
do
it
way
below
sticker
srihari
id
hate
to
rehash
an
old
thread
but
would
someone
kindly
quote
a
prices
that
a
dealer
quotes
for
a
civic
ex
and
escort
gt
also
im
a
assuming
that
the
was
the
so
go
ahead
and
look
that
up
too
if
someone
has
one
of
those
yearly
buyers
guides
that
give
a
low
quote
price
please
quote
them
too
then
find

it
does
set
off
my

greyhound
has
apparently
gotten
around
to
installing

they
use

to

how
close
other

are

how
fast
their

are

signals
a
warning
to
the

if
theyre

my

the

that

ok
would
other

break

is

check

requirements
for
valve

timing
belt
changes

so
on

service
is
often

make

has
done

this

i

moving
the

installation
of

apparently
shelby

im
no

dont
the
early

have
a

that
is

just
a

single

not
an

with
a

rod
locating
it

anyway
simple
strut
suspensions
like
this
can
be
lowered
just
by
using
shorter
springs
cutting
the
springs
lowering
the
spring
perch
or
shortening
the
strut
below
the
perch
in
each
of
these
cases
the
suspension
geometry
will
suffer

the

angle
a
spacer
placed
between
control
arm
and
the
bottom
of
the
strut
roughly
the
height
of
the
reduction
will
restore
the

imho
the

from
all
ive
heard
from
my
us
relatives
drivers
esp
here
in
germany
are
much
more
agg
ressive
but
not
disciplined
one
of
my
relatives
a
la
resident
hired
a
car
at
the
nuernberg
airport
and
went
about
miles
to
our
home
he
said
then
that
he
grew
about
year
older
during
this
ride
and
swore
hed
never
drive
a
car
in
germany
again
this
was
in
and
he
kept
his
promise
the
situation
now
is
even
worse
as
effect
of
the
increased
volume
of
traffic
what
you
mean
by
better
disciplined
should
perhaps
be
considered
cautious
due
to
fear
when
driving
around
here
you
always
have
to
take
into
consideration
that
the
majority
of
the
other
drivers
absolutely
relies
on
you
they
expect
that
nobody
fails
or
sleeps
many
of
them
exploit
this
by
driving
as
fast
as
their
car
can
go
of
course
only
where
that
is
allowed
you
might
think
dream
on
so
any
mistake
you
make
is
a
very
high
risk
to
your
health
and
if
youre
ex
posed
to
such
a
situation
from
your
very
first
day
as
a
driver
you
learn
to
handle
it
or
you
lose
thats
the
way
i
and
most
people
i
know
experience
our
traffic
situation
whether
you
think
this
is
pleasant
or
efficient
is
up
to
you
i
think
we
handle
a
very
high
volume
of
traffic
and
that
at
high
speeds
with
modest
compared
to
the
volume
and
decreasing
rates
of
lethal
accidents
otoh
more
and
more
people
esp
women
dislike
driving
because
they
feel
overtaxed
and
threatened
and
each
accident
is
one
accident
too
much
the
roads
comprising
the
autobahn
are
much
better
designed
than
they
are
here
and
usually
include
animal
fences
this
makes
them
far
more
predictable
than
most
us
highways
better
designed
and
maintained
may
be
but
animal
fences
are
very
rare
auto
bahnen
and
many
other
streets
have
guardrails
i
hope
thats
the
right
word
a
plank
made
from
thick
steel
sheet
fixed
on
uprights
its
about
feet
high
those
guardrails
are
designed
for
keeping
vehicles
on
the
road
smaller
animals
can
crawl
under
the
plank
bigger
ones
can
easily
jump
over
it
the
point
is
that
esp
larger
animals
are
very
rare
in
germany
they
tend
also
to
be
very
timid
accidents
caused
by
animals
are
a
neglegible
danger
not
all
of
europe
is
the
autobahn
most
places
in
europe
have
speed
limits
that
arent
outofline
with
what
we
used
to
have
in
the
us
if
my
friends
werent
lying
to
me
theyre
typically
not
much
higher
than
youre
right
there
are
speed
linits
even
on
the
major
part
of
the
autobahn
but
the
attitude
towards
driving
see
above
seems
to
be
very
similar
to
that
in
germany
ive
been
in
france
switzerland
italy
austria
spain
belgium
the
netherlands
besides
that
you
really
cant
rely

abiding

limits
ive

quite

lot
of
practise
miles
and
im
used
to
travel

fyi
with
a
car
even
smaller
than
a
rabbit
but
i
consider
driving
on
the
highways
round
paris
or
milano
really
a
thrill
i
strongly
suspect
you
wont
find
a
lot
of
rabbit
owners
doing
nearly
on
the
autobahn
but
i
could
be
wrong
sorry
but
youll
find
quite
a

rabbitclasscar
or
even
smaller
mine
is
a
peugeot
owners
going
that
fast
small
cars
with
much
hp
are
very
hip
over
here
and
most
people
buying
such
cars
arent
afraid
to
let
them
run
some
people
have
no
respect
for
their
own
lives
i
disagree
the
size
or
weight
of
a
car
is
rather
irrelevant
cars
weigh
less
than
kg
and
the
drivers
have
a
chance
to
survive
accidents
at
mph
or
higher
otoh
when
crashing
against
a
solid
object
at
mph
it
makes
no
difference

you

i
think

that

batch
of

also
someone
said
that

above
especially
about

the

very
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
ergonomically
sound
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
relatively
smooth
roads
and
most
noticable
thing
is
that
the
probes
suspension
doesnt
like
potholes
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
potholed
road
somewhere
around
town
and
see
if
the
jarring
you
get
is
tolerable
yes
this
cars
stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
the
problem
with
the
back
seat
is
that
theres
no
leg
room
plenty
of
head
room
though
shorter
people
fit
back
there
without
any
complaints
so
long
as
the
seat
they
are
sitting
behind
is
pulled
forward
a
bit
to
give
them
a
place
to
put
their
feet
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passengers
now
very
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventilation
you
may
want
to
consider
that
when
combined
with
the
heat
the
power
moonroof
can
greatly
improve
the
ventilation
throughout
the
car
i
really
enjoy
the
moonroof
by
the
way
but
then
ive
always
been
a
sucker
for
open
air
driving
no
leakage
problems
or
anything
like
thatyet
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
ford
will
replace
at
no
charge
but
i
havent
heard
about
anything
like
this
concerning
the
probes
i
havent
had
any
real
trouble
with
this
car
outside
of
a
cv
joint
boot
that
was
leaking
but
the
dealer
took
care
of
that
promptly
and
even
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
was
without
my
car
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
way
they
handledespecially
considering
that
i
was
expecting
the
worst
from
them
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
hope
this

ive

this
would
include

distance
but
not

taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in

base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some

on
this
is

probability

ill

i

fixing
to
buy
a
car
in

next

months
aiming
toward
something
a
little
bigger
than
a
typical
small
car
and
with
a
little
more
power
i
am
considering
the

accord
corolla
and
the
the
probe
is
the
youngest
of
the
bunch
thus
my
interest
in
opinions
but
every
magazine
and
ratings
book
places
it
as
an
excellent
value
btw
the
is

is

a

for

while

read
this

i
was
looking
for
valentine

information
sigh
maybe
in

faq
and
came
across
your
posting
i
bought
a
probe
gt
with
the
pep
last
july
now
at
miles
after
debating
over
the
sentra
stealth
prelude
and
celica
check
this
months
consumer
reports
for
previous
probe
records
my
criteria
a
fun
car
with
abs
airbag
over
and
less
than
i
thought
about
a
turbo
but
checking
with
insurance
people
ruled
that
out
the
tristar
cars
eclipsetalonetc
were
out
since
they
dont
have
an
air
bag
ditto
for
the
mustangalso
no
abs
the
fell
into
the
pocketrocket
category
a
good
used
car
buy
the
was
almost
there
but
rolled
more
than
i
liked
i
didnt
like
the
prelude
dashinstrumentation
at
all
too
weird
for
me
the
has
a
much
smaller
nonpassenger
space
than
i
needed
so
out
that
went
the
celica
was
ok
but
underpowered
when
loaded
with
options
and
somewhat
overpriced
too
in
nonturbo
form
i
never
considered
the
since
it
didnt
have
an
airbag
i
did
look
at
it
for
its
rwd
virtues
but
thats
it
the
corolla
never
entered
my
mind
i
should
have
looked
at
the
mitsubishi
stealth
more
since
my
list
was
exhausted
i
bought
the
probe
the
car
design
is
different
than
earlier
years
so
its
too
early
to
see
its
reliability
so
far

vtec
honda
del
sol
i
drive
it
to
and
from
work
each
day
on
relatively
smooth
roads
and
most
noticable
thing
is
that
the
probes
suspension
doesnt
like
potholes
when
you
test
drive
one
find
a
potholed
road
somewhere
around
town
and
see
if
the
jarring
you
get
is
tolerable
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
my
back
seat
passengers
now
very
few
complain
about
the
lack
of
ventilation
you
may
want
to
consider
that
when
combined
with
the
heat
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
leather
and
the
keyless
entry
system
werent
available
when
i
got
the
car
so
i
cant
comment
on
them
i
got
the
car
before
it
was
officially
announced
i
prefer
cloth
to
leather
anyway
i
wouldnt
want
this
car
in
the
snow
the
suspension
is
too
rough
for
the
inevitable
surprise
potholes
tires
arent
meant
for
snow
and
the
seats
assume
that
youre
not
wearing
lots
of
thick
clothing
rain
is
much
better
water
generally
beads
off
the
windshield
at
freeway
speed
the
windshield
wiper
controls
are
easy
and
understandable
and
i
barely
hydroplaned
once
with
the
eagles
and
i
was
really
trying
there
is
also
a
definite
lack
of
cup
holdersmall
storage
places
the
gt
has
map
holders
below
the
speakers
in
the
door
but
theyre
rigid
plastic
that
could
fit
two
cassettes
or
cds
max
the
center
consolestorage
binarm
rest
has
cup
holder
and
the
back
of
the
front
seats
have
a
cloth
pouch
but
thats
it
no
change
holders
quite
a
letdown
from
the
sho
and
the
probe
is
definitely
not
a
peoplemover
car
or
an
econobox
car
lastly
dont
store
wet
car
covers
in
the
back
the
foam
will
soak
the
water
up
and
the
result
will
not
smell
pleasant

this
happened
about
a
year
ago
on
the
washington
dc
beltway
snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of
them
was
struck
in
the
head
by
one
of
the
larger
rocks
i
dont
recall
if
she
made
it
but
i
think
she
was
comatose
for
a
month
or
so
and
doctors
werent
holding
out
hope
that
shed
live
what
the
hell
is
happening
to
this
great
country
of
ours
i
can
see
boyhood
pranks
of
peeing
off
of
bridges
and
such
but
pound
rocks
has
our
society
really
stooped
this
low
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on
demand
and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at
will
so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
well
people
fortunatly
or
unfortunatly
only
the
us
is
experiencing
the
devaluation
of
human
life
among
developed
nations
i
am
an
american
but
i
was
raised
in
europe
where
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
somebody
is
get
his
car
broken
into
or
have
his
pocket
picked
by
slaves
or
russian
refugees
of
cource
there
will
be
some
nutcases
but
thats
extremely
rare
ie
in
greece
you
can
walk
through
any
neighborhood
at
any
time
during
the
night
without
even
worrying
in
germany
you
can
walk
the
sidewalks
at
am
and
not
even
look
behind
your
back
at
the
sanitation
crews
that
clean
the
streets
to
a
sparkling
cleen
whoever
of
you
have
been
there
you
know
what
i
am
saying
i
dont
have
any
easy
answers
but
if
we
as
a
nation
do
some
selfcritisism
we
might
get
somewhere
of
course
these
postings
sould
be

but
if
we
reduce
crime
here
it
ll
mean
less

insurance
rates
thus
we

more

i
was
taking
an
offramp
exit
to
another

my

suddenly
screamed

large
hit
the
side
of
my

we
slowed
down
but
after
looking
back
to
see
the
vandals
standing
there
we
drove
on
to
the
police
station
she
did
get
a
good
look
at
the
guy
and
saw
him
cock
his
arm
with
something
the
size
of
a
cinderblock

i
never

we
are
very
lucky
the
truck
sits
up
high
on
the
road
if
it
would
have
hit
her
window
it
would
have
killed
her
the

are
looking
for
the

in
all
likelyhood
he
is
gone
i
am
a

knock
on

it
was
nighttime
and
i
never

the

said
they
thought
the
motive
was
to
hit

have

stop

then
jump

several

myself

were
riding
in

pickup
heading
south
on

north
of
seattle
wa
someone
threw
a
rock
of
an
overpass
and
hit
our
windshield
not
by
accident
im
sure
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
to
the
overpass
quickly
to
see
who
did
it
we
figured
it
was
kids
reported
it
and
left
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
happend
again
and
killed
a
guy
at
my
company
he
was
in
his
midfourties
and
left
behind
a
wife
and
children
turned
out
there
was
a
reformatory
for
juviniles
a
few
blocks
away
they
caught
the
year
old
that
did
it
they
put
a
cover
over
the
overpass
what
else
could
they
do
i
dont

ill
over
forget
this
story
in
des

iowa
about
a
year
ago
some
kid
dropped
a
rock
from
an
overpass
and
hit
car
just
behind
the
windshield
it
put
a
dent
in
the
roof
so
i
guess
i
was
lucky
it
hit
metal
its
frustrating

we

the
quality
of

is
something
of
a
myth
the
road
surface
isnt
much
different
to
a
typical
tx
freeway
they
are
better
in
terms
of
lighting
safety
signs
roadmarkings
etc
they
light
the
highways
in
texas
funny
everywhere
else
ive
been
they
only
light
em
at
junctions
i
wont
even
get
into
how
much
road
markings
vary
between
states
and
localities
except
to
say
that
there
are
some
areas
where
markings
are
essentially
nonexistant
than
most
of
the
roads
here
a
dip
in
the
asphalt
that
you
test
your
shocks
on
at
will
kill
you
at
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
it
would
have
to
be
quite
severe
i
dont

any

i
would
regard

any
decent
well
damped

i
suspect
you
have
very
limited
experience
us
freeways
vary
dramatically
particularly
between
states
i
can
name
a
number
of
interstate
highways
in
various
parts
of
the
country
where
would
be
very
optimistic
in
any
car
im
not
sure
what
you
call
quite
severe
in
terms
of
road
deviations
but
i
suspect
every
single
bridge
junction
on
through
ct
would
be
considered
so
theyre
hard
to
take
at
thats
not
the
only
interstate
ive
seen
with
such
deviations
but
its
one
i
drive
frequently
texas
is
pretty
much
an
edgecase
you
cant
assume
that
everywhere
has
roads
in
such
good
condition
such
flat
terrain
and
such
wideopen
spaces
it
just
aint

you
still

but
whether
the

has
much
of
anything
that
goes

is
another
matter

you
just
gotta
love
the

too

at

the

they
used
to
use

circa

between
traction

so

oh
yeah
and
narrow

one
of
the

for

was
to
install

that
reflected

the

of

im

was

called
the

based

they
said
they
have
buyers
in

area
interested
in
my
car
or
they
wouldnt
be
talking
to
me
they
talked
to
me
for
a
good
minutes
asking
everything
about
my
car
and
said
they
could
sell
it
no
problem
they
guaranteed
that
if
they
didnt
sell
my
car
in
days
i
would
get
my
money
back
and
since
i
charged
it
im
protected
by
federal
law
which
states
that
if
im
not
satisfied
i
would
get
a
refund
which
is
true
they
federal
expressed
all
the
paperwork
to
me
which
had
a
contract
stating
their
policy
about
the
days
and
such
i
called
up
the
bbb
in
illinois
and
they
do
not
have
a
file
on
them
which
is
good
news
so
they
definitely
are
a
legitimate
company

so
far
its

have
been
wondering
about

myself
the

the
were
identical
except
for
the

in
particular
the
manual
transmission
yes
some
owners
had
problems
with
the
transaxles
using
synthetic
lubricants
in
the
transaxles
solved
the
problem
in
most
cases
the
problem
was
not
unique
to
the
awds
however
it
was
common
to
all
models
the
galant
and
gsx
had
the
same
transaxle
but
i
didnt
see
those
listed
in
cr
electrical

i
dont
know
of
any
major
complaints
in
this
area
except
that
the
battery
that
was
installed
at
the
factory
had
a
low
current
rating
and
brakes
were
below
par
in
both
models
the
first
fwd
models
those
built
before
may
were
recalled
for
brake
upgrades
some
fwd
and
awd
owners
had
problems
with
warped
rotors
those
of

who
insist
on
using
manual
torque
wrenches
every

the

can

you
to
someone

has
gone
through
a

in

it
all
depends
on
how
you

it
seems
that
most

have

my

is

hello

im

im

probably
rent
a

ive
been
quoted
for
a

for

this
would
include
free
driving
distance
but
not
local
taxes
baltimore
they
also
told
me
all
insurance
thats
necessary
is
included
but
i
doubt
that
cause
a
friend
rented
a
car
last
year
and
it
turned
out
he
needed
a
lot
more
insurance
than
whats
included
in
the
base
price
but
on
the
other
hand
he
didnt
rent
it
from
alamo
does
anyone
have
some
info
on
this
is
a
ripoff
no
that
sounds
pretty
reasonable
for
that
car
and
that
city
probability
that
ill
be
needing
more
insurance
unless
you
have
an
accident
you
wont
need
more
if
you
plan
on
paying
for
the
car
with
a
credit
card
check
and
see
if
your
card
automatically
covers
rental
cars
also
your
own
auto
insurance
may
cover
rental
cars
also
most
rental
companies
here
offer
extra
insurance
when
you
rent
and
require
you
to
initial
in
several
spots
if
you
dont
want
it
the
credit
cards
and
personal
auto
insurance
provide
the
same
sort
of
coverage
that
the
rental
agency
is
trying
to
sell
i
have
never
rented
from
alamo
so
i
dont
know
if
they
follow
this
same
practice
is
the
beretta
a
good
rental

yes
it
is
a
compact
probably
a

very

it

note
that
the

drivers
command
not
some
preselected

the
driver
still

now
there
is
no
dispute
that
in
production
cars
automatics
are
inherently
more
lossy
than
manuals
that
is
in
theory
my
point
all
along
is
that
whatever
mechanical
advantages
a
manual
has
over
an
automatic
can
very
easily
be
lost
by
a
driver
who
isnt
skillful
or
one
thing
that
gives
an
automatic
an
advantage
at
launch
is
the
fact
that
it
has
a
torque
converter
vs
a
clutch
i
know
this
sounds
strange
but
a
torque
converter
multiplies
the
engine
output
when
launching
it
functions
as
a
sort
of
limited
continuously
variable
transmission
typically
you
get
a
torque
multiplication
of
to
times
depending
on
the
stall
speed
i
have
yet
to
see
a
torque
multiplier
installed
on
a
production
automobile
such
systems
do
exist
but
none
are
presently
installed
in
production
autos
that
i
am
aware
of
these
are
commonly
called
viscous
drive
cvts
or
fluidic
amplifiers
contrasted
to
a
clutch
which
merely
slips
when
feathered
result
is
no
tq
mult
what
the
convertor
does
allow
is
for
the
engine
to
be
closer
to
its
torque
peak
during
the
launch
before
a
clutched
car
can
fully
engage
its
driveline
chevy
proved
it
many
years
ago
with
the
camaro
ets
and
terminal
mile
times
were
close
enough
tpo
be
identical
for
speed
and
auto
cars
note
that
this
is
also
the
major
reason
that
an
auto
car
can
get
away
with
fewer
gears
than
a
manual
the
slip
in
the
convertor
makes
up
for
the
fewer
ratios
and
before
everyone
starts
yelling
about
the

autos

be
out
note
that
some
manufacturers
are

manulas
now
once

however
the

found

the
decision
was
for
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
council
of
better
business
bureaus
pointing
out
the
fact
that
if
you
have
an
automobile
that
does
not
depreciate
rapidly
the
manufacturer
has
no
incentive
to
deal
with
you
there
is
no
way
that
the
manufacturer
can
loose
because
they
can
turn
around
and
sell
the
vehicle
at
a
profit
if
the
consumer
is
awarded
a
repurchase
the
attitude
of
chevrolets
representative

tends
to
support
this
point
of

he
was
totally
unprepared

did
not

take
the
proceeding
very
seriously
i
decided
to
take
the
repurchase
even

i
am

totally
screwed

the
price
i

this
vehicle
required
repair
after
repair
systems
that
required
attention
included
the
transmission
heater
fan
paint
suspension
and
motor
the
main
problem
was
the
five
speed
manual
transmission
they
could
not
install
a
nondefective
transmission
in
at
least
four
attempts
so
in
summary
it
is
possible
to
get
a
repurchase
but
you
are
going
to
get
screwed
on
the
price
unless
you
paid
too
much
in
the
first
place
or
if
your
car
happens
to
be
a
model
that
depreciates
rapidly

could

cease

i
fail
to
see
why
people
feel
the
need
to
expound
upon
this

for
days
and

these

if

please
take

thanks
i
just
want
to
second
this
request
i
value
this
net
group
as
one
where
people
focus
on
solving
problems
and
go
out
of
their
way
to
be
respectful
of
differences
the
hostility
expressed
in
the
original

feels
like
an
assault
thanks
jan
exactly
my
point
there
is
a
lot
of
hostility
to
and
from
teenagers
look
i
sent
these
posts
here
to
altparentsteens
with
a
copy
to
recautos
since
you
people
in
this
group
may
have
the
best
advice
for
and
experience
with
troubled
teenagers
if
you
follow
the
news
for
the
northwest
usa
you
will
have
heard
that
a
group
of
old
boys
barely
out
of
the
teens
certainly
their
outlook
was
developed
during
their
teens
just
shot
and
killed
an
innocent
little
girl
riding
in
a
car
in
the
seattle
area
when
her
mother
who
was
driving
honked
her
horn
at
the
car
with
the
boys
in
it
this
is
really
upsetting
and
makes
my
stomach
turn
as
it
would
any
parents
doesnt
your
heart
just
go
out
to
that
poor
mother
yes
fred
my
heart
and
prayers
go
out
to
the
mother
and
others
who
have
been
victims
of
these
and
other
senseless
crimes
you
folks
in
this
group
have
a
responsibility
to
offer
any
good
advice
that
you
may
have
i
suspect
lots
of
people
all
over
the
world
will
read
and
appreciate
your
comments
however
i
feel
that
you
have
missed
the
point
of
the
previous
postings
see
top
your
statement
of
responsibility
is
felt
as
an
attack
towards
the
members
of
this
group
you
are
attempting
to
make
the
members
of
this
group
be
required
to
answer
the
only
people
who
should
make
a
statement
are
people
who
have
experienced
the
problem
and
found
a
workable
solution
teenagers
both
drive
cars
and
are
involved
in
automotive
vandalism
and
crime
maybe
someone
on
this
newsgroup
has
had
specific
experience
in
dealing
with
violent
teenage
offenders
like
these
kids
are
at
the
same
time
maybe
you
would
have
some
good
advice
for
those
hostile
people
who
sense
that
are
now
the
potential
victims
maybe
you
would
have
some
good
advice
for
them
on
how
not
to
pay
back
andor
not
make
the
situation
worse
maybe
you
have
some
good
advice
for
local
authorities
or
schools
where
this
problem
is
prevalent
but
then
again
maybe
youre
not
interested
many
people
are
interested
but
have
no
input
i
will
restate
that
your
last
sentence
here
is
seen
as
an
attack
on
the
members
of
this
group
if
people
have

they
will
give

if
they
do
not
you

to

if
you
wish

please
send

do
not

or
attempt

i
will

the

i
am
currently
in
the
car
market
and
would
like
opinions
on
a
vw
passat
glx
how
does
it
compare
to
a
toyota
camry
i
thought
the
car
looked
very
solid
stable
and
european
only
disappointment
so
far
is
that
that
it
doesnt
offer
an
airbao
my
next
question
is
why
isnt
vw
offering
automobiles
with
airbags
should
i
pay
the
extra
three
thousand
for
a
bmw
is
even
though
it
is
smaller
and
less
powerful
than
than
the
passat
i
think
vw
got
caught
out
on
the
airbag
thing
its
only
been
in
the
last
year
or
two
that
airbags
have
become
a
significant
selling
feature
vw
assumed
that
automatic
belts
would
satisfy
govt
requirements
for
passive
restraint
but
didnt
guess
that
the
merican
consumer
would
actually
make
buy
decisions
based
on
the
presence
of
an
airbag
vw
is
really
hurting
right
now
in
the
us
market
check
out
the
article
in
last
weeks
autoweek
about
the
crisis
at
vw
golfs
and
jettas
will
be
coming
from
the
plant
in
mexico
but
they
dont
have
the
quality
at
that
facility
as
per
normal
vw
practice
the
us
launch
of
the
jetta
iii
is
delayed
again
and
again
until
a
good
chunk
of
the
useful
life
of
the
design
is
spent
i
think
that
passats
come
from
germany
so
there
is
not
the
same
quality
and
availability
issue
its
a
nice
car
with
a
nice
engine
whether
vw
will
be
a
player
in
the
us
market
in
two
years
time
is
a
different
question

wasnt

the

subject
what
car
is
this
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
could
enlighten
me
on
this
car
i
saw
the
other
day
it
was
a
sports
car
looked
to
be
from
the
late
early
it
was
called
a
bricklin
the
doors
were
really
small
in
addition
the
front
bumper
was
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
body
this
is
all
i
know
if
anyone
can
tellme
a
model
name
engine
specs
years
of
production
where
this
car
is
made
history
or
whatever
info
you
have

on

and
i
was
wondering
if
people
out
there
have
any
opinions
that
differed
from
what
these

have
to
say
depending
on
how
you
plan
to
use

i
might
recommend
also
browsing
trailer
boats
and
one
or
more
of
those
pickup
shotgun
and
magazines
the

rags
mostly
seem
to
consider
recently
graded
pea
gravel
to
be
offroading
and
ten
sacks
of
redwood
chips
to
be
a
bedload
considering
that
most
of
these
suvs
seem
to
be
used
mostly
as
robust
station
wagons
thats
probably
not
a
bad
approach
but
if
your
applications
are
more
demanding
pick
your
information
sources
accordingly
of
the
three
vehicles
on
your
short
list
explorer
pathfinder
id
recommend
the
as
being
closely
based
on
a
rather
robust
pickup
and
the
explorer
for
being
comfortably

dont

this

about
a
year

on

snot
nosed
drunken
kids
decided
it
would
be
really
cool
to
throw
huge
rocks
down
on
cars
from
an
overpass
four
or
five
cars
were
hit
there
were
several
serious
injuries
and
sadly
a
small
girl
sitting
in
the
front
seat
of
one
of

was
struck
in

by
one
of
the

rocks
i
dont

made

was

werent

can

our
society
really
stooped
this
low
erik
velapold
society
as
we
have
known
it
it
coming
apart
at
the
seams
the
basic
reason
is
that
human
life
has
been
devalued
to
the
point
were
killing
someone
is
no
big
deal
kids
see
hundreds
on
murderous
acts
on
tv
we
can
abort
children
on

and
kill
the
sick
and
old
at

so
why
be
surprised
when
some
kids
drop
lbs
rocks
and
kill
people
they
dont
care
because
the
message
they
hear
is
life
is
cheap
at
well
people
fortunatly
or
unfortunatly
only
the
us
is
experiencing
the
devaluation
of
human
life
among
developed
nations
i
am
an
american
but
i
was
raised
in
europe
where
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
to
somebody
is
get
his
car
broken
into
or
have
his
pocket
picked
by
slaves
or
russian
refugees
of
cource
there
will
be
some
nutcases
but
thats
extremely
rare
ie
in
greece
you
can
walk
through
any
neighborhood
at
any
time
during
the
night
without
even
worrying
in
germany
you
can
walk

at

not
even
look

that
clean

whoever
of

you

i

i
dont

we

these

if

it
was
hardly
the

various

techniques
for

mounting
the

were
quite
common
in
early

both
us

foreign
right
in

both

i
have
never

what
posessed
auto
builders
to
put
delicate
controls
which
must
be
used
with
skill
and
finesse
like
clutches
and
brakes
on
the
floor
why
not
hand
control
its
much
much
easier
in
the
early
days
neither
of
these
functions
had
powerassist
so
only
legs
had
enough
strength
to
activate
them
since
then
its
been
traditional
and
people
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
used
to
anything
else
well
where
exactly
would
you
put
a
hand
clutch
and
brake
on
a
motorcycle
its
easy
the
handlebars
have
a
very
limited
range
of
turning
steering
wheels
on
the
other
hand
turn
around
and
around
and
aroundwhich
is
fine
for
electrical
relays
like
your
cruise
control
and
airbagbut
how
many
of
you
want
to
lose
your
clutch
andor
brake
due
to
a
short
circuit
shades
of
the
edsel
they
had
pushbuttons
in
the
steering
wheel
hub
that
controlled
the
auto
tranny
it
was
very
disconcerting
to
shift
into
reverse
when
turning
a
corner
and
the
wires
shorted
there
are
workarounds
but
theres
really
no
reason
to
use
hand
power
on
a
cars
clutch
or
brakes
and
lightening
them
to
the
point
that
they
are
finesse
controls
suitable
for
hand
use
would
increse
the
mechanical
complexity
substantially
look
at
power
brakes
and
nonpower
brakes
for
an
example
i
saw
an
experimental
car
that
had
a
joystick
instead
of
a
steering
wheel
thats
about
useless
imho
another
automotive
oddity
is
separate
keys
for
trunks
doors
and
ignitions
why
on
earth
would
you
want
this
i
know
i
dont
i
want
a
separate

key
for
security
reasons
it
gives

a

you
pay

they
get

of
selling

looks

fraud
would
be
fairly
easy
for
the
price
of
a

you
can
say
it
has
however
many

you
want
to
tell
the

it
has
in
california
they
have
a

on

you

if

never

you
want

make
sure
it
is

maybe
excluded
many
cant
be

i

they

the

the

i
think
hes
talking
about
a
different
form
of
rush
evidently
its
fun
to
be
terrified
but
hey
if
you
want
that
kind
of
rush
try
bobsledding
you
may
only
get
up
to
or
so
but
it
makes
in
a
car
feel
like
a
stroll
in
the
park
why
should
a
good
driver
be
terrified
at
the
only
thing
i
fear
going
at
are
drivers
who
switch
to
the
left
lane
without
using
either
rearviewmirror
or
flashers
doing
to
aint
a
rush
for
me
but
its
fun
and
i
get
where
i
want
to
go
much
faster
but
in
one
point
you
are
quite
right
if
you
are
terrified
at
you
should
better
not
drive
that
fast

youll
be

not
a

just
a
point
id
be
scared
at
here
not
because
i
feel
i
or
my
car
couldnt
handle
it
but
because
of
exactly
what
you
said
drivers
who
are
stupid
like
the
ones
who
are
doing
also
and
so
they
pull
in

you
at

yeah
real
smart
this
scares
me
in
cities
at
when
i
cant
see
enough
of

to
make

recognizable
they
are

close

when

them
doing

the

shouts

customers

all

you
deserve

my

bought

this
kind

is
what
i
was
shocked
by
in

crying
out
loud
how
do
these
turkeys
think
they
can
talk
to
customers
this
way
and
still
stay
in

again
i
dont
expect
sales
people
to
bow
scrape
and
grovel
in

but
i
sure
dont
expect
to
be
abused
either
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
way
the

people
talked
to
me
and
in
other

sessions
i
overheard
in
neighboring

cubicles
evidently
their
success
rate
is
high
enough
that
they
continue

do
business
this
way
there
must
be
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
are
easy

intimidate

im
not

about
the

approach
that
saturn
and

i
guess
if
their

is
fair
its
ok
maybe
the
best
approach
is
to
do
your
homework
before
you
go
in
find
out
the
invoice
prices
of
the
car
add
a
reasonable
profit
for
the
dealer
offer
them
that
price
and
stick
to
it
if
they
get
abusive
just
leave

dont

around
here
freeways
are
often

solid
with
large

there
were
any

i
would
be
passing

however
i
cant
as
i

before
all
it
takes
is
a

some
moron
tramping
on
the
brakes
to
turn
this

into
a
cloud
of
shredded
metal
flying

burning

i
want
to
maintain
enough

between
myself
and
this

to
at

have
a
minimal
chance
to
avoid
a

maintaining
a

it

there
is
no

of
shortdriving

who
are
dying

they
can
add
themselves

wouldnt

me
so
much

that
after
letting
enough
of

pass
me
and
glue
themselves
to
the

ahead
my

is
filled
up
trying

back
off
further
does
not
work
because
the

behind
me
has
filled
up
trapping
my

right
into

ever
increasing
pack
now
if
there
was
any
slight
possibility
that
there
was
a

open
ahead
id
be
glad
to
move
over

there
usually
is
no

i
block

are

its

noises
assuming
yours

the

is
characteristic
of
a

toyota
didnt

automatically
cross
out
any

which

it

if
you

is
there
anything

how
about
the

of
installing

would
it

any

a

the
emissions
of
diesels
are
the
cleanest
of
any
vechicle
but
they
are
considered
so
polluting
that
they
are
banned
in

what
a

of
crap
diesel
is
the
fuel
of
choice
for
enviromental
benefit
in
europe
while
here
its
illegal
for
the
same
reason
the
particulates
are
nothing
but
carbon
they
are
just
an
annoyance
at
worst
nothing
beats
the
diesel

for
efficiency
and

that
this

james
i
really
hate
to
do
this
but
try
reading
the
damn
posts
then
you
shouldntve
done
it
try
answering
the
damn
question
i
am
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
was
no
mention
of
the
sc
in
there
never
was
a
tbird
mentioned
the
discussion
was
about
shos
and
stangs
not
being
up
to
spec
i
do
not
know
about
tbirds
i
only
know
that
the
specs
quoted
for
the
sho
by
previous
poster
sounded
a
little
anemic
for
me
to
say
that
it
was
up
to
snuff
this
does
not
kn
any
way
disencourage
me
from
wishing
to
own
one
nor
does
it
make
it
a
bad
car
it
merely
means
that
i
think
ford
could
have
added
that
extra
bit
of
safety
and
tossed
in
larger
brakes
as
the
wheels
are
plenty
large
enough
for
them
to
fit
if
memory
serves
right
which
it
may
very
well
not
and
the
motor
plenty
powerful
enough
to
need
it
well
my
point
was
that
the
sc
and
the
sho
both
have
very
similar
characteristics
front
and
rear
disks
abs
on
the
sho
high
output
independent
suspension
very
good
aerodynamics
harness
fat
rubber
and
top
speed
if
one
of
them
is
up
to
standard
and
i
think
the
sc
is
but
the
other
isnt
then
why
is
that
no

there

unsynchronised

well
here
in

duh
it
i
agree
wholeheartedly
cant
be
done
also
most
north
american
made

come
with
the

so
why
bother
with
a
manual
when
the

can
shift
for
you
for
no

money
not

about
there
in

here
in

the
manuals
are
quite
often
the
standard
equipment
of
course
finding
a
car
with
one
might
be
hard

if
you
read
the
sticker
on

there
is
usally
an

so
tacked

you
actually

make
the

a
driving
force
behind
efforts
to
increase
the
availability
of
both

vehicles
and

president

signed
the
order
today
which
calls
for
federal
purchases
of
alternative

vehicles
in
numbers
over
the
next
three
years
at
least
percent
higher
than
those
called
for

that
i
will
be
working

happen
oleary
said
as
land
commissioner
gary
mauro
has
helped
make
texas
a
national
leader
in
converting
the
state
fleet
to
alternative
fuels
and
has
been
a
tireless
proponent
of
natural
gas
vehicles
in
speeches
across
the
country
the
task
force
is
to
issue
a
report
within
days
recommending
a
plan
and
schedule
of
implementation
the
department
of
energy
and
all
of
us
in
government
must
lead
by
example
if
the
option
of
alternative

is
going
to
become
a
practical
affordable
choice
for
fleet
owners
across
the
country
oleary
said
increased
use
of
domesticallyproduced
alternative
fuels
means
reducing
pollution
while
creating
jobs
we
believe
that
energy
efficiency
protecting
the
environment
and
a
healthy
economy
are
complimentary
goals
oleary
said
that
plans
call
for
the

to
coordinate

fiveyear
purchase

help
with

needed
to
make

practical
under

the

will
also
be
working
with

there
was
no

any

the

if

there
youd
spill
all

we
used

the

induce

she

she

a

she
quite

asked

began
taunting

bow
scrape

grovel

i
sure
dont

to
be
abused
either
i
was
very
surprised
by
the
way
the
sales
people
talked
to
me
and
in
other
negotiating
sessions
i
overheard
in
neighboring
sales
cubicles
evidently
their
success
rate
is
high
enough
that
they
continue
to
do
business
this
way
there
must
be
a

out

are
easy

intimidate
a
couple

months

i
went
to
a
dealership
to
test
drive
a
car
afterwards
we
sat
down
to
discuss
prices
i
explained
that
i
wanted
a
car
just
like
the
one
i
drove
but
in
a
different
color
he
said
he
could
get
one
exactly
like
i
wanted
from
the
dealer
network
within
a
day
we
then
negotiated
a
price
and
signed
the
deal
next
day
i
get
a
call
he
explains
that
they
goofed
and
they
had
neglected
to
take
into
account
a
price
increase
the
last
price
increase
had
occurred
over
months
prior
to
my
visit
if
i
still
wanted
the
car
i
would
have
to
fork
over
another
as
an
alternative
they
would
honor
the
price
if
i
bought
the
car
i
test
drove
which
had
been
sitting
around
for
months
and
had
a
few
miles
on
it
i
said
goodbye
this
was
a
good
example

how
they
can
lowball
you
and
still
cover
their
butts
its
too
bad
more
people
dont

honesty
or
these
types
of
dealers
would
no

be

the
next
dealership
i
went
to
was
straightforward
and
honest
first
thing
the
salesman
said
was
letss
see
what
you
have
for
dealer
cost
and
work
out
how
much
profit
i
should
make

simply
do
not
expect
when
they
are
driving
to
be
overtaken
at
a
speed
differential
of
i
dont
think
this
is
because
they
are
stupid
of
course
there
are
exceptions
they
are
just
programmed
because
of
the
limit
do
you
in
the
states
when
you
look
in
the
rearview
always
calculate
future
positions
of
cars
based
on
a
speed
differential
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
to
drive
in
the
left
lane
fast
but
when
i
overtake
cars
who
are
on
the
right
i
slow
down
a
tad
bit
if
i
were
to
rely
on
the
judgement
of
the
other
car
to
recognize
the
speed
differential
i
would
be
the
stupid
one
just
to
satiate
my
curiosity
why
would
this
make
you
the
stupid
one
it
seems
to
me
everybody
should
be
aware
enough
of
what
is
going
on
you
do
not
need
to
calculate
the
future
position
you
need
to
look
at
your
mirrors
a
little
more
if
you
glance
around
you
will
be
able
to
tell
how
much
faster
than
you
the
car
is
going
maybe
not
precisely
but
well
enough
to
know
if
you
should
let
him
around
before
you
try
to
pass
i
know
what
you
are
talking
about
about
the
other
driver
being
startled
because
i
myself
have
been
startled
by
drivers
cruising
by
at
around
when
im
doin
the
problem
though
as
i
saw
it
was
not
their
fault
for
barreling
around
me
but
my
fault
for
not
paying
the
attention
to
my
taskathand
that
i
should
have
been
oddly
enough
since
the
timehappened
in
around
mo
when
id
had
my
liscence
for
around
mo
i
havent
been
startledand
ive
been
passed
by
cars
doing
roughly
twice
the
speed
of
my
car
another
odd
occurance
is
the
fact
that
this
only
seems
to
happen
on
long
tripsand
if
i
drive
along
with
them
it
doesnt
happen
at
all
even
on
the
long
trips
adrenaline
will
do
that
to
youive
had
bad
cop
experiences
with
speeding
so
anything
over
the
limit
is
adrenalizing
for
mescared
ill
get
caught
maybe
they
should
raise
the
limit
so
we
can
pay
better
attention

the

its

has

re
saturns
pricing
policy
i
just
ordered
a
saturn
after
considering
a
few
imports
frankly
the
saturn
way
of
doing
business
and
service
was
a
very
big
plus
i
hadnt
bought
a
new
car
since
i
bought
my
honda
back
in
and
i
was
unbelieveably
offended
by
most
salespeople
i
met
saturn
was
indeed
very
different
i
made
three
different
visits
to
the
dealer
where
i
bought
my
car
and
was
never
pressured
saturn
also
had
the
best
aftersales
support
and
the
fixed
pricing
made
it
very
easy
for
me
to
decide
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
buy
another
big
selling
point
was
running
into
my
mechanic
at
the
dealer
hes
been
fixing
imports
for
yearsand
bought
a
saturn
based
on
what
hes
seen
and
heard
from
his
customers
saturn
also
has
a
good
extended
warranty
program
for
miles
fully
refunded
if
you
dont
use
it
that
works
out
to
an
actual
cost
of
or
so
based
on
the
year
treasury
rates
using
savings
account
rates
its
more
like
in
the
first
three
years
it
also
buys
you
free
rental
during
any
warranty
work
without
counting
against
the
refund

my

just
hit
the
magic
mile
mark
and
now
all
sorts
of
things
are
beginning
to
go
bad
the
latest
problem
i
am
experiencing
is
with
my
brakes
they
still
stop
the
car
fine
but
once
i
am
stopped
completely
my
brake
pedal
will
sink
another
or
inches
all
by
itself
if
feels
really
strange
and
i
am
worried
my
brakes
will
quit
working
one
of
these
days
i
checked
my
brake
fluid
and
the
reservoir
was
full
but
the
fluid
itself
looked
really
dirty
like
dirty
oil
i
called
my
mechanic
and
he
told
me
i
need
a
new
brake
master
cylinder
which
will
cost
me
a
whopping
you
are
not
alone
my
honda
accord
with
miles
on
it
started
showing
the
same
behavior
i
replaced
the
brake
master
cylinder
myself
it
took
about
an
hour
and
cost
about
sure
beats
paying
to
have
someone
else
do
it
if
i
wanted
to
rebuild
my
own
master
cylinder
instead
of
putting
in
a
rebuilt
one
it
would
have
cost
only
to
for
the
rebuild
kit
the
honda
brake
master
cylinder
is
easy
to
get
to
two
bolts
attach
it
to
the
engine
compartment
two
brake
lines
enter
the
master
cylinder
the
tricky
part
was
that
the
brake
lines
were
stuck
tight
my
craftsmen
open
end
wrench
rounded
off
the
bolt
heads
i
had
to
use
vise
grips
to
loosen
those
suckers
wow
best
invention
since
sliced
bread
after
that
it
was
very
easy
bolt
the
new
part
in
place
add
new
brake
fluid
and
bleed
the
brakes
this
is
quite
easy
even
for
a
beginner
my
local
auto
parts
store
had
a

all
you
have
to
do
is
turn
it
in
to
the
police
like
you
would
an
accident
get
a
report
and
send
it
in
to
your
insurance
company
and
they
will
contact
the
other
guys
insurance
company
and
they
will
have
to
pay
just
as
they
would
in
an
accident
they
caused
thus
no
need
to
go
to
court
a
friend

did

got

im
considering

have
heard

i
was
worried
that
this
might
be

pain
when
you

i
have

they
try

dont

theyll
drop
you

after
you
do

theyll
just
make
filing
the
claim
a
pain
but
it
will
end
when
they
leave
you
in
the
lurch
ive
read
in
this
group
that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar
guns
by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
more
than
that
geico
funded
the
company
that
developed
lidar
when
locals
showed
a
reluctance
to
buy
the
units
geico
started
giving
them
away
i
know
theyve
given
units
to
the
florida
highway
patrol
county
sheriffs
a
and
some
local
governments
the
real
question
is
why
this
is
the
hook
geico
and
other
ins
cos
can
tell
which
drivers
represent
risk
this
is
a
determination
they
can
make
after
you
receive
a
speeding
ticket
from
one
of
geicos
lidar
units
most
drivers
do
not
represent
increased
risk
even
after
a
ticket
or
two
but
this
gives
them
the
opportunity
to
raise
rates
for
equal
risk
its
called
extra
profits
they
also
know
how
silly
the
nsl
is
and
how
it
is
almost
universally
ignored
driving
in
excess
of
the
nsl
gets
you
a
ticket
an
increase
in
your
rates
points
on
your
license
but
it
doesnt
make
you
a
riskier
driver
to
insure
like
the
sound
of
this
like
the
people
who
thought
up
the
scheme
go
geico
unless
you
have
some
driving
history
problems
youre
usually
better
to
go
with
one
of
the
major
companies
and
stay
there
youll
get
long
term
customer
discounts
on
your
premiums
now
about
the
of

re

detector
ive
had
a
valentine
for
about
months
now
and
i
agree
that
it
is
the
best
det
ector
available
the
point
here
is
trust
and
reliability
ive
been
able
to
tr
ust
the
valentine
more
than
any
other
detector
ive
owend
if
the
valentine
sa
ys
that
there
is
a
moderate
to
strong
radar
source
in
front
of
me
then
its
mo
re
than
likely
to
be
a
speed
trap
with
my
other
detectors
ive
gotten
so
many
falses
that
ive
begun
to
ignore
someo
of
the
warnings
because
i
didnt
want
t
o
drive
like
i
had
one
foot
on
the
brake
and
one
on
the
gas
pedal
that
directional
indicator
really
really
helps
plus
more
info
is
almost
alwa
ys
better
than
less
info
no
matter
how
smart
radar
detectors
get
the
human
br
ain
is
usually
smarter
so
if
im
going
to
make
a
decisio
based
on
information
at
hand
i
want
all
the
info
i
can
get
plus
if
you
divide
the
overall
streng
th
of
the
radar
signal
by
the
number
of
bogeys
reported
youll
find
that
each
bogey
is
pretty
weak
and
therefore
not
a
radar
threat
with
other
detectors
yo
ull
just
get
one
strong
warning
my
logic
may
be
faulty
on
this
but
i
think
i
t
works
okay

got

i
bought
at

and
are
made
specifically
for
the

they
have
been
made
to
be
exactly
the

as
the
nonlocking

said
so
on
the
package
and
i
verified
it
myself
i
havent
had
any
vibration
problems
with
the
tires
at
all
due
to
the

in

i
did
have
some

it

there
anything

easier
since
were

instead
of

lets
hear
peoples
opinions
this
really
bugs
me
the
emissions
of
diesels
are
the
cleanest
of
any
vechicle
but
they
are
considered
so
polluting
that
they
are
banned
in

what
a

of
crap
diesel
is
the
fuel
of
choice
for
enviromental
benefit
in

while
here
its
illegal
for
the
same
reason
the
particulates
are
nothing

carbon
they
are
just
an
annoyance
at
worst
nothing
beats
the
diesel
cycle
for
efficiency
and
emissions
torque
or
engine
durability
its
also
cheaper
diesels
fall
into
the
same
emissions
mythology
as
alcohol
fuels
the
main
reason
they
are
considered
cleaner
is
because
they
are
better
at
the
emissions
we
actually
measure
and
regulate
but
they
also
contribute
additional
emissions
which
have
long
been
determined
to
be
as
harmful
but
no
suitable
control
or
limits
have
been
defined
current
evidence
is
pointing
to
most
visible
smog
actually
being
diesel
emissions
and
suspended
particles
and
less
of
a
photochemical
reaction
diesel
particulates
are
now
becoming
a
major
concern
in
decreased
lung
capacity
and
alcohols
emit
signifcantly
more
aldehydes
a
known
carcinigen

gasoline
the
evidence
is
mounting
that
while
we
have
been
beating
the
gasoline

to
death
we
may
have
been
ignoring
the
effects
of

anyone
who
thinks
diesels
are
so
great
should
go

spend
a

in

there
the

of

in

cars
ive
played
with
the

were
the
racing
variety
with
dog
clutches
instead
of
sychros
in
a
transmission
with
dog
clutches
the
gears
are
always
engaged
with
each

and
moving
the
dog
clutches
engages
the

motorcycle
transmissions
are
the
same
way
shifting
without
the
clutch
on
a
transmission
with
syncros
can
and
will
cause
transmission
damage
the
only
question
being
how
long
it
takesto
grenade
something
for
the

in
my
pulsar
se
it
was
about
miles
but
it
had
a
weak
tranny
in
the
first
place
just
out
of
curiosity
how
is
this
dog
clutch
any
different
from
a
synchro
transmission
what
you
described
sounds
the
same
to
me
in
fact
what
little
ive
studied
on
trannies
the
instructor
referred
to
the
synchros
as
dogs
and
said
they
were
synonymous
the
gears
are
always
meshed
in
a
synchronized
gearbox
and
you
slip
the
synchro
gears
back
and
forth
by
shifting
or
at
least
that
is
what
i
was
taught
explain
por
favour
motorcycle
transmissions
dont
have
synchros
the
engagment
dogs
are
very
corse
and
sloppy
there
are
maybe
teeth
dogs
on
the
side
of
the
gears
that
engage
the
next
gear
over
as
the
forks
slide
the
gears
back
and
forth
to
shift
start
to
apply
pressure
at
the
same
time
the
clutch
is
pulled
the
clutch
is
a
hand
lever
and
shift
quickly
if
you
try
a
slow
lazy
shift
it
will
grind
you
just
have
to
pop
it
into
the
next
gear
before
it
has
a
chance
to
grind
there
isnt
a
neutral
between
gears
obviously
there
is
but
you
cant
select
it
with
the
shifter
so
double
clutching
is
not
a
possibility
speed
shifting
which
is
what
i
have
always
heard
clutchless
shifting
called
works
pretty
well
for
upshifts
with
some
practice
but
i
usually
use
the
clutchespecially
for
the
lower
gears
i
think
auto
as
in
automobile
trannys
are
similar
except
that
the
engagment
dogs
are
very
fine
with
no
slop
and
the
addition
of
syncho
rings
the
gear
teeth
are
always
engaged
in

that
are

not

didnt
word
it
right
the
first
time
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
if
you
plan
to
blow
by
somebody
at
a
very
high
speed
differential
and
you
assume
you
are
safe
because
the
guy
sees
you
you
are
stupid
of
course
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
i
have
had
some
very
scary
instances
when
i
assumed
this
and
i
dont
think
all
of
the
fault
was
the
other
guy
now
if
he
was
going
in
a
thats
a
whole
different
story
ok
i
can
agree
to
this
because
as
we
have
both
proved
what
is
ideally
supposed
to
happen
isnt
always
and
even
though
im
rearely
the
one
doing
the
passing
i
dont
see
where
it
makes
you
stupid
but
i
agree
that
if
you
think
you
are
safe
because

other
guy
is
supposed
to
have
been
paying
attention

yes

this

i
have
to

i
dont

by

how
can
you

i
dont

so
that
behavior
was
somewhat
encouraged
back
then
in
fact
i
think
the
only
difference
between
now
and
then
is
that
nowadays
when
some

kills
another
one

we

the

back

theyd
never

something
like
that
period
yeah
people
act
really
shocked
about
violence
as
though
it
were
new
to
our
species
what
about
the
holocaust
the
crusades
the
salem
witch
trials
the
religious
persecutions
of
the
middleages
what
about
violent
acts
carried
out
in
the
name
of
religion
all
over
the
world
what
about
the
early
christians
put
to
death
by
the
romans
the
jews
persecuted
by
christians
there
are
a

do

the

but
there
are
far
more
people
on
the
planet
than
there
were

hundred
years
ago
the
per

acts
of
violence
are
probably
not
significantly
different

that

what

is
keep

in

jonathan

based
on
my
experience
with
a
the
hardtop
jeepstyle
model
i
would
definitely
give
a
new
model
consideration
if
i
were
in
the
market
the
older
models
are
very
well
built
unless
toyota
lost
its
mind
i
would
assume
until
proven
otherwise
that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages

you

youll

i

the

i

there

as

there
is
a

she
claimed
part

was
not

having

first
off
the
correct
spelling
of
nissans
luxury
automobile
division
is
infiniti
not
infinity
i
would
also
like
to
clear
up
the
question
of
what
kind
of
engines
power
lexus
and
infiniti
automobiles
since
a
person
had
remarked
in
earlier
posts
that
most
lexus
and
infiniti
models
had
engines
while
at
the
same
time
saying
that
several
of
each
manufacturer
used
engines
lexus
the
and
have
an
inline
infiniti
inline
i
must
admit
that
i
cannot
remeber
for
sure
here
inline
is
correct
i
hope
this
helps

we
were
at
a

today
looking
at
buying
a
car
and
the
salesman
was
showing
us
something
he
was
calling
a
buy
back
is
that
a
car
that
was
fleeted
and
then
given
back
for
the
new
model
the
next
year
if
that
is
so
how
many
miles
is
a
good
number
to
have

are
these
types

generally
a

nothing

the

no
is

the

isnt
set
in

though
low
milage
extra
addons
and
stuff
like
that
there
can
increase
the
resale
price
of
the

you
may
want
to
head
on
over
to
the
local
library
or
borrow
your
friends
blue
book
and
read
up
on
that
sort
of
stuff
i
paid
under

retail
for
my
civic

it
was

the

was
desparate
to

it
was

both
you

has
a

manual
tranmission
since
the
car
was
bought
new
while
shifting
from

is
normal
for
the
car
is
it
and
about
a
year
ago
at
the
stick
shift
handle
got
stuck
while
attempting
to
put
it
in
reverse
the
shifter
would
not
budge
the
clutch
had
no
effect
the
front
tires
would
not
budge
even
when
the
clutch
is
fully
depressed
if
the
clutch
is
released
the
engine
would
die
assuming
that
some
gear
was
engaged
while
the
shifter
was
stuck
i
could
not
make
the
car
move
it
acted
as
if
it
were
in
neutralexcept
for
dying
when
clutch
is
released
i
finally
was
able
to
release
the
shifter
by
having
someone
rock
the
car
back
and
forth
less
than
an
inch
while
i
depressed
the
clutch
and
jiggled
the
shifter
the
shifter
acted
normally
after
that
when
this
happened
i
took
it
to
the
dealer
they
checked
the
clutch
it
was
ok
they
checked
the
transmission
it
was
ok
i
had
the
exact
problem
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
again
last
week
the
dealer
says
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
because
mitsubishi
the
says
they
have
never
heard
of
the
problem
and
the
dealer
could
not
reproduce
the
problem
while
they
had
the
car
in
all
three
occurances
the
car
was
parked
head
first
in
a
garage
and
since
the
front
wheels
were
stuck
the
car
could
not
be
towed
to
the
dealer
before
releasing
the
shifter
hence
temporarily
solving
the
problem
and
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
refused
to
send
someone
to
check
the
car
while
it
was
stuck
i
know
there
is
smething
wrong
with
the
transmission
shifting
from
to
and
getting
stuck
at
random
but
i
cant
get
the
dealer
to
fix
it
i
need
your
help
with
the
mechanical
problems
and
with
how
to
handle
mitsubishi
all
hints
and
suggestions
are
greatly
appreciated
and
sorry
to
bore
you
with
the
long
post
thanks

but
why
not
turn
the
question
around
why
are
automatics
so
common
in
the
us
because
some
people
like
them
and
some
people
actually
need
them
my
guess
is
that
when
they
tried
to
couple
manuals
to
the
torquerich
in
the
sixties
the
clutches
turned
out
as
real
killers
you
had
to
use
both
feet
to
depress
and
that
this
has
just
lived
on
yeah
right
real
muscle
cars
had
a
manual
transmission
and
their
clutches
arent
that
heavy
shelbyamerican
used
plenty
of
highpowered
hightorque
engines
and

only
put
autos
in
his
cars
because
people
wanted
them
blasphemers
heretics
burn
them
burn
them
for
defiling
a
shelby
with
an
auto
real
cobras
and
they
were
the
ultimate
sports
car
at
the
time
had
bigblock
fords
which
turned
out
prodigious
amounts
of
power
and
torque
and
none
of
them
had
automatics
and
also
an
automatic
with
a
engine
can
be
real
fun
to
drive
yeah
if
you
call
a
gear
shift
in
the
middle
of
a
curve
fun
i
personally
would
love
to
have
a

pillarless

with

we
would

to
remove
the

and
scoop
out
the
water
under
the

cover
on

i
would
guess
this
usually
happens
after
a
good
thunder
storm
a
few
qs
is
this
a
common

yes
this
is
a
common
problem
the
leaks
occur
through
the
seal
of
the
taillights
unfortunately
ford
has
this
with
most
probes
and
does
not
have
a
recall
for
it
very
dissatisfying
to
say
the
least
where
are
the
drain
holes
located
for
the
hatch
there
is
no
drain
holes
that
i
know
of
i
used
a
margine
tub
to
drain
it
regretably
i
waited
three
months
as
i
was
short
cash
and
they
wouldnt
fix
it
under
warrantee
then
i
paid
dearly
as
it
messed
up
my
electrical
system
including
a
balancemotion
sensor
which
is
located
near
the
fuel
shutoff
in
the
trunk
this
resulted
in
my
passive

would

so
i
ended
up
paying
about
to
have
the

replaced
to

the
tail
lights
resealed
they
firts
replaced
the
hatch
gasket
which
i
insisted
was
not
the

so
they
did
not
charge
me
for
that

i
proved
to
be

not

nor
do
they
reach
however
using
high
to
be
mph
a
they
are
quite
amenable
to
long
high
speed
drives
ive
done
several
mile
trips
in
my
civic
with
no
problems
whatsoever
the
last
big
trip
i
made
was
driving
from
new
york
to
texas
i
remember
driving
miles
a
day
at
typically
mph
without
any
problems
im
sure
i
would
have
been
more
comfortable
driving
a
benz
but
no
white
knuckles
no
problems
with
winds
and
curves
then
there
was
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
after
mardi
gras
where
we
were
doing
all
the
way
to
houston
no
problems
b
both
my
cars
have
surprising
good
fuel
economy
at
high
speeds
i
see
no
difference
between
sustained
mph
and
sustained
on
the
trip
back
from
new
orleans
we
got
about
mpg
in
my
integra
quite
ok
mind
you
the
engine
revs
to
almost
at
the
civic
is
markedly
better
than
the
integra
in
fuel
economy
miles
down
the
road
i
still
get
mpg
at
mph
driving
b
i
cant
understand
why
these
highscale
european
marquees
are
afraid
to
design
engines
that
can
be
repeatedly
revved
to
near
redline
in
the
low
gears
i
have
been
doing
that
for
that
last
miles
with
my
lowly
civic
with
no
detriment
to
either
the
engine
or
the
clutch
and
getting
excellent
mpg
to
boot
id
call
this
an
engineering
hack
to
cover
up
design
deficiencies
at
miles
youd
still
be
breakingin
a
highscale
european
marquee
they
typically
are
designed
to
last
miles
per
engine
mi
per
chassis
the
record
is
now
over
miles
on
a
benz
diesel
and
ive
read
about
transmissions
lasting
miles
speaking
of
now
now
you
cant
compare
a
diesel
with
a
gasoline
engine
i
see
enough
bmws
and
gasoline
mercs
for
sale
that
have
miles
on
them
and
advertise
rebuilt
engines
if
honda
was
to
build
an
accord
for
id
darn
well
expect
the
sucker
to
last
miles
diesels
they
have
very
good
efficiency
at
the
cost
of
acceleration
and
are
very
popular
in
all
european
cars
diesel
is
considered
the
green
fuel
from
the
smallest
econoboxes
to
the
luxobarges
again
we
see
a
difference
in
mentality
diesels
in
the
us
are
considered
slightly
worse
than
useless
and
extremely
dirty
to
boot
so
you
cant
give
them
away
ever
got
caught
behind
a
early
at
a

light
its
not
pleasant
the
newer
mbs
are
a
lot
better
though
the
diesel
volvos
and
vws
are
probably
the
smelliest
offenders
as
for
economy
why

we

re

worth

my
wife
and
i
looked
at
and
drove
one
last
fall
this
was
a
model
it
was
wayyyyyyyyy
underpowered
i
could
not
imagine
driving
it
in
the
mountains
here
in
colorado
at
anything
approaching
highway
speeds
i
have
read
that
the
new
models
have
a
newer
improved
hp
engine
im
quite
serious
that
i
laughed
in
the
salesman
face
when
he
said
once
its
broken
in
it
will
feel
more
powerful
i
had
been
used
to
driving
a
jeep
engine
i
believe
the
land
cruisers
land
yachts
were
the
sames
as
the
which
is
also
underpowered
in
my
own
personal
opinion
they
are
big

very
roomy
but
nothing

i

i
used

that
it

about
more

a

id
heard
that
there
were

market

were

good

better
note
that
the
major
difference
looks
wise
between
a
kubel
a

are
the
hood
and
the
fenders
the
kubel
had
an
external
spare
mounted
on
the
hood
and
the
hood
sloped
down
for
visibility
sharply
and
had
rounded

the

has

pannel
of

has

and
the

also
has
been

therefore
the
true
meter
reading
is
the
reading

replacement
plus
current
mileage
that
shows
mile
difference
comparing
to

mileage
on

disclosure

never

me
anything

that
i

with

u

this

will

thanks
this
is
a
tricky
situation
if
the
previous
owner
didnt
inform
the
dealer
of
the
odometer
change
then
the
previous
owner
committed
fraud
and
he
may
be
liable
the
dealer
may
also
be
liable
if
the
previous
owner
notified
the
dealer
or
if
the
previous
owner
had
the
dash
replaced
at
a
dealer
or
if
the
previous
owner
had
the
dash
changed
legally
any
records
search
on
the
car
should
turn
up
the
fact
that
the
odometer
had
been
altered
if
a
dealer
changes
the
speedometer
he
has
to
report
it
it
goes
into
the
cars
service
record
with
the
manufacturer
and
on
the
title
if
i
remember
correctly
the
dealer
told
me
that
the
old
mileage
etc
were
sent
to
ford
when
my
tbirds
speedo
was
replaced
if
the
odometer
can
be
set
to
the
old
mileage
it
must
be
if
it
cant
eg
electricallydriven
odometers
then
the
mileage
of
the
old
odometer
must
be
written
on
a
permanent

which
is

of

it
did
it
again
this
morning
my
ford
ranger
was
idling
at
rpm
ok
so
i
exaggerated
a
little
but
it
was
idling
very
fast
it
has
a
liter
carburated
engine
in
it
and
no
blipping
of
the
throttle
would
cause
the
idle
to
drop
back
to
normal
i
dont
think
the
linkage
is
stuck
what
can
i
do
to
fix
this
problem
this
has
been
a
problem
from
time
to
time
but
has
straightened
itself
out
until
now
i
dont
have
a
tach
but
by
gauging
by
the
sound
of
the
engine
it
is
idling
about
twice
as
fast
as
it
should
be
this
is
down
from
what
it
was
idling
at
when
i
pulled
up
at
a
stop
light
sometimes
a
bad
choke
pulloff
diaphram
will
cause
a
car
to
fast
idle
the
pulloff
which
is
vacuum
actuated
provides
a
necessary
pull
in
noncold
weather
conditions
to
get
the
idle
off
the
the
fast
idle
cam
locate
the
fast
idle
cam
on
your
vehicle
and
see
if
you
can
rotate
it
to
produce
a
normal
idle
if
so
locate
the
diaphram
and
test
it
if
you
cant
apply
suction
via
a
good
piece
of
rubber
vacuum
hose
with
your
mouth
that
will
cause
the
diaphram
to
retract
then
its
bad
and
should
be
replaced

we
would
have
to
remove
the
spare
and
scoop
out
the
water
under
the
plywoodcarpet
cover
on
the
trunk
i
would
guess
this
usually
happens
after
a
good
thunder
storm
a
few
qs
is
this
a
common
problem
where
are
the
drain
holes
located
for
the
hatch
i
noticed
this
is
my
probe
also
when
recently
cleaning
out
the
back
i
think
the
water
is
coming
up
through
some
rubber
stoppered
holes
beneath
the
spare
mine
looked
slightly
worn
and
there
was
no
water
or
water
damage
above
the
level
of
the
spare
area
this
has
taken
a
low
priority
since
i
just
found
out
while
rotating
my
tires
that
i
have
a
torn
cv
boot
ugh
ive
got
an
gt
it
has
the
smoked
taillight
assembly
i
think
this
is
where
the
water
is
getting
in
when
i
first
got
it
had
it
for
a
month
one
of
the
rear
taillights
fogged
up
with
moisture
i
took
it
in
to
the
dealer
and
they
replaced
the
entire
assembly
it
happened
to
the
other
one
about
months
later
this
time
i
happened
to
look
in
the
spare
tire
well
and
noticed
water
standing
in
there
the
dealer
was
more
reluctant
this
time
to
replace
it
but
i
convinced
them
to
fix
it
they
must
have
had
to
deal
with
a
number
of
other
probes
with
the
same
problem
i
havent
noticed
water
in
the
taillamps
or
the
trunk
for
the
last
years
but
just
last
month
the
taillamp
just
fogged
up
again
im
going
to
try
to
take
it
back
to
get
them
to
fix
it
again
im
real
tempted
to
drill
some
vent
and
drain
holes
in
the
tops
and
bottoms
of
the

there
are
lots
of
lowspeed
collisions
that
do
worry
me
get
into
an

and
you
may
reconsider
ive
been

it

i
value

it
may
not
happen
often

when
it
does
youll
sure
be
glad
you
got
a
safe
car
granted
the
tests
arent
perfect
but
id
much
rather
be
in
a
car
that
did
well
in
the
test
than
a
car
that
did
horribly
you
raise
a
valid
point
but
again
its
a
tradeoff
how
much
money
do
you
want
to
spend
for
that
kind
of
protection
you
could
buy
a
volvo
saab
or
benz
and
get
really
good
crash
protection
and
other
luxuries
but
youll
pay
significantly
more
for
it
in
my
case
its
out
of
the
question
because
all
of
those
cars
are
beyond
my
budget
ive
been
in
two
major
auto
accidents
both
were
multiple
car
the
worst
was
a
headon
three
car
collision
t
intersection
and
one
person
ran
a
stop
sign
in
both
cases
i
was
stopped
and
had
no
place
to
go
and
i
saw
it
coming
both
times
even
in
highspeed
headon
collisions
the
most
beneficial
item
you
can
have
is
a
good
old
seatbelt
nowadays
at
least
in
the
us
you
get
an
airbag
if
you
get
a
belt
so
presumably
you
get
an
added
safety
benefit
there
as
well
thats
something
i
certainly
look
for
and
which
can
be
had
in
inexpensive
cars
if
you
really
want
to
add
safety
to
any
car
simply
add
a
cage
to
the
car
they
are
available
and
cheap
about
in
the
usa
add
to
that
four
or
five
or
six
point
belts
and
you
will
walk
away
from
collisions
that
were
otherwise
not
survivable
but
instead
of
people
spending
a
little
extra
money
we
get
legislation
that
says
the
govt
must
mandate
a
minimal
level
of
protection
for
everyone
one
other
significant
factor
in
improving
ones
own
safety
is
to
get
some
training
this
will
improve
your
safety
more
than
any
other
single
investment
will
driveride
defensively
and
that
does
not
mean
you
have
to
be
a
doddering
old
stick

the
mud
people
here
tend
to
enthuse
about
autos
more
than
the
average
probably
in

still
we
sometimes
overlook
the

what

a

back
i

late
at

i
was
changing

at
a
bent
crosssing
it
curved
off
to
the
south
east
becoming
hidden
by
trees
after
about
ft
and
continued
to
the
left
strait
north
i
wanted
to
turn
north
checked
the
south
lane
rolled
into
the
crossing
and
checked
the
north
lane
nevertheless
there
wasnt
a
car
in
sight
so
i
took
one
last
look
and
pulled
into
the
left
hand
lane
now
my
car
isnt
a
sec
performer
but
i
was
in
the
corect
lane
and
over
in
decent
time
even
at
i
wasnt
wasting
time
it
was
then
that
i
checked
my
mirror
and
saw
a
mustang
closing
in
my
lane
fast
he
had
just
turned
the
corner
and
was
just
noticing
me
luckly
he
saw
me
and
changed
lanes
in
time
i
estamate
he
was
moving
in
excess
of
or
so
i
was
just
a
by
stander
i
had
no
chance
of
runing
from
him
or
moving
out
of
his
way
im
glad
he
saw
my
brake
lights
in
time
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
would
have
happened
had
i
wainted
to
pull
out
and
not
left
the
time
he
needed
to
dodge
me
rule
just
because
your
car
can
do
and
your
way
is
clear
dont

it
will
stay

a

once
in

i
went
to
the
dealer
and
he
said
that
it
happens
all
of
the
time
and
he
recomended
putting
a
bug
deflector
on
the
hood
he
said
that
the
trucks
for
some

reason
seem
to
have
this
problem
more
than
some

it
seems
to
me
that
either
my

is

there
might

a

seen
is
good
a
return
to
tradition
c
scoop
on
the
sides
and
roof
line
much
like
a
or
fastback
you
know
im
a
ford
fan
i
must
say
so
im
looking
forward
to
the
next
mustang
i
have
faith
that
it
will
be
a
fine
product
more
desireable
than
the
camaro
is
now
you
know
thats
mho
the
differences
these
days
between
ford
and
gm
are
not
so
much
the
quality
just
the
philosophy
it
used
to
be
quality
and
philosophy
gm
is
barely
catching
up
but
they
have
more
room
for
improvement
that
can
only
be
made
up
in
time
stss
still
come
off
the
assembly
line
with
screwed
up
paint
stripes
and
poor
trunkdoorhoodpanel
alignments
its
those
year
old
plants
and
the
latest
gm
products
still
come
with
the
standard
equipment
rattledash
tm
but
like
i
said
theyre
getting
better
and
making
the
move
in
the
right
direction
they
beat
ford
to
the
market
with
the
camarofirebird
but
really
only
in
words
production
of
these
vehicles
will
be
limited
until
the
end
of
the
year
keeping
selling
prices
above
msrp
for
the
most
part
since
there
are
so
many
twitching
camaro
fans
out
there
i
wouldnt
press
ford
to
hurry
the
mustang
since
the
final
wait
could
be
worth
it
besides
no
bowtie
fanatic
is
gonna
buy
the
mustang
anyway
i
do
not
put
much
stock
in
the
mag
rags
inside
information
or
even
ford
rep
quotes
the
taurus
was
pretty
much
a
surprise
when
it
was
finally
disclosed
in
its
entirety
inside
information
had
the
taurus
with
a
and
rearwheel
drive
at
one
point
i
wouldnt
look
for
a
simple
repaneled
mustang
folks
you
may
be
cheating
yourself
if
you
do
theres
a
lot
of
potential
ford
hasnt
released
a
new
car
without
a
is
in
years
the
mustang
project
has
been
brewing
for
at
least
right
a
is
could
happen
those
modular
are
out
there
too
in
the
interest
of
cafe
and
competition
dont
rule
those
out
either
your
ignorant
if
you
do
and
there
are
so
many
spy
shots
and
artist
renderings
out
there
who
really
knows
what
itll
look
like
the
mach
iii
doubt
it
highly
the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
i
submit
that
the
mustang
will
be
a
success
enough
to
elicit
defensive
remarks
from
some
heavy
camaro
fans
here
you
know
intelligent
critical
spews
like
the
mustang
bites
man
some
of
you
are
already
beginning
i
predict
that
the
mustang
and
camaro
will
be
comparable
performers
as
usual
i
predict
that
the
differences
will
be
in
subjective
areas
like
looks
and
feel
as
usual
the
camaro
is
still
a
huge
automobile
the
mustang
will
retain
its
cabrearward
styling
and
short
ponycar
wheelbase
the
camaro
still
reaches
out
to
the
fighter
pilot
while
the
mustang
will
appeal
to
the
driver
the
camaro
will
still
sell
to
the
muscle
car
set
while
the
mustang
will
continue
to
sell
to
the
collegedegreed
muscle
car
set
both
will
be
more
refined
i
do
think
the
camaro
is
there
will
be
no
clear
winner
unless
the
ford
gets
the
romeo
you
dont
seriously
believe
that
it

weird

auto
miles
when

long
enough
to
get

hot
especially
at

speeds
the
transmission
has
this
nasty
habit
of
getting
stuck
in

as
a
result
when
you
stop
for
a
light
the
motor
stalls
putting
the
car
in
park
and
waiting
for
seconds
before
restarting
sometimes
allows
the
transmission
to
reset
and
go
back
into
otherwise
it
just
stalls
when
put
in
drive
my
thoughts
either
it
the
gear
band
is
binding
and
getting
stuck
when
it
gets
hot
not
so
likely
or
perhaps
the
lockup

is
not

properly
seems
likely
the
least
likely
keeping
fingers
crossed
is
that
some
critical
vacuum

this

is
due

emissions
is
there
anything
in

install
scrubbers

how
about
the

of
installing

cars
would
it
be
any

than
a
catylitic

id
assume
easier
since
were
removing
particulate

instead
of
converting
gasses
lets
hear
peoples
opinions
the
technology
cummins
is
applying
to
diesels
to
comply
with
the
newer
ca
emissions
laws
involves
three
things
i
know
of
all
compliant
diesels
are
turbocharged
all
use
an
aftercooler
which
cools
the
air
which
was
heated
by
compression
by
the
turbocharger
up
to
about
psi
a
gismo
on
the
injector
pump
which
senses
the
pressurized
air
intake
and
limits
full
delivery
of
fuel
while
the
pressure
is
low
no
scrubbers
catalytic
converters
etc
are
used
the
path
from
the
turbocharger
to
the
exhaust
outlet
is
kept
very
free
interestingly
except
for
the
lowpressure
fuel
limitation
power
output
and
mileage
are
enhanced
by
these
measures
one
can
buy
aftermarket
turbos
and
aftercoolers
which
generate
more

the

there
are
two
crank
configurations
for
the
flat
the
most
common
one
is
probably
the
crank
that
is
very
similar
to
the
crank
which
flat
engines
have
style
cranks
comparing
those
two
engines
the
and
the
flat
have
no
first
order
shaking
forces
or
rocking
moments
the
has
a
second
order
shaking
force
while
the
flat
has
a
second
order
rocking
moment
the
significant
thing
about
the
flat
second
order
moment
is
that
it
can
be
easily
balanced
out
by
adding
mass
at
the
ends
of
the
crank
the
however
requires
a
counter
rotating
shaft
with
mass
to
balance
out
the
second
order
forces
i
am
sure
that
subaru
and
porsche
use
the
boxer
configuration
and
not
the
inline
crank
that
you
analyzed
and
compared
would
you
care
to
reevaluate
the
other
case
of
a
flat
four
i
think
that
this
configuration
is
perfectly
balanced
as
far
as
primary
secondary
forces
and
couples
are
concerned
i
have
an
article
in
front
of
me
that
says
so
bottom
line
the
biggest
difference
between
the
engines
would
probably
be
their
intended
use
the
flat
is
easier
to
fit
under
low
hoods
and
in
rear
compartments
for
mid
or
rear
mounting
the
can
be
mounted
transversely
to
reduce
hood
length
read
cab
forward
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
fanfare
to
the
differences
between
them
no
matter
what
subaru
ads
say
technology
shared
with
porsche
indeed
the
flat
four
is
also
shorter
than
an
inline
so
even
if
it
is
mounted
longitudinally
it
will
not
take
up
lots
of
length
and
a
longitudinal
placement
is
easier
for
a
wheel
drive
drivetrain
i
think
that
subarus
ads
hold
water
in
practice
their
flat
fours
are
noticeably
smoother
than
inline
and
completely
buzz
free
though
some
may
not
like
its
peculiar
note
but
as
alfa
has
shown
a
boxer
four
can
produce
a
spine

do

will
hear
your

if
you
have

he
will
not
again
this
has
been
my
experienc
just
get
a
remote
model
that
is
not
visible
to
the
cop
but
be
sure
to
get
front
and
rear
sensors
you
can
also
just
put
the
detector
off
to
the
side
on
the
dash
so
the
cop
doesnt
see
it
right
awayvalentine
is
the
best
detector
by
far
as
stated
by
car
and
driver
and
even
tells
you
what
direction
the
radar
is
coming
from
it
also
gives
the
amount
of
threats
it
is
picking
up
so
if
you
go

place
everyday

it
always
goes

you
can
glance
at
the
number
of

on
the
subject
of
the
upcoming
new
mustang
i
do
not
put
much
stock
in
the
mag
rags
inside
information
or
even
ford
rep
quotes
the
taurus
was
pretty
much
a
surprise
when
it
was
finally
disclosed
in
its
entirety
inside
information
had
the
taurus
with
a

rearwheel

at
one

i
wouldnt
look
for
a
simple
repaneled
mustang
folks
you
may
be
cheating
yourself
if
you
do
theres
a
lot
of
potential
ford
hasnt
released
a
new
car
without
a

in
years
the
mustang
project
has
been
brewing
for
at
least
right
a
is
could
happen
those
modular
are
out
there
too
in
the
interest
of
cafe
and
competition
dont
rule
those
out
either
your
ignorant
if
you
do
and
there
are
so
many
spy
shots
and
artist
renderings
out
there
who
really
knows
what
itll
look
like
the
mach
iii
doubt
it
highly
the
next
mustang
will
be
fords
highest
profile
car
it
attracts
way
more
attention
than
the
camarofirebird
because
its
heritage
is
more
embedded
in
the
general
public
dont
lie
to
yourself
and
believe
ford
will
forfeit
that
the
car
magazines
have
printed
a
lot
of
information
about
the
new
mustang
and
the
consensus
about
what
to
believe
in
my
car
circle
is
that
the
suspension
pieces
and
tuning
will
be
almost
identical
to
the
current
cobra
but
on
a
stiffer
body
structure
which
will
improve
its
behavior
after
the
thunderbird
cost
and
weight
debacle
ford
decided
independent
rear
suspension
with
rear
wheel
drive
wont
be
tried
again
in
a
volume
car
the
current
will
soldier
on
for
about
two
years
a
version
of
the
valve
modular
in
the
mark
viii
could
be
offered
then
ford
is
spending
big
money
tooling
up
for
and
engines
which
will
power
most
of
their
cars
in
the
immediate
future
and
therefore
probably
do
not
consider
volume
production
of
hp
engines
a
priority
undisguised
the
car
looks
ok
but
not
nearly
as
exciting
as
the
new
camarofirebird
imo
i
suspect
ford
will
produce
their
car
with
higher
quality
than
gm
will
achieve
with
the
camaro
firebird
the
way
gm
loses
money
the
temptation
to
just
get
them
out
the
door
for
the
sake
of
positive
cash
flow
will
be
great
once

i
was
worried
that
this
might

when
you
make

i
have
also

they
try

you
if
you

ive
read
in

that
geico
has
funded
the
purchasing
of
radar

by
police
depts
im
not
sure
where
geico
has
purchased
radar
guns
in
several
states
i
know
they
have
done
it
here
in
ct
i
have
also
heard
horror
stories
about
people
that
have
been
insured
by
geico
for
years
and
then
had
accident
and
were
immediately
dropped
and
once
youve
been
dropped
by
any
insruance
company
you
become
labled
a
high
risk
and
end
up
forking
out
or
times
what
you
should
be
for
insurance
this
must
vary
from
state
to
state
because
our
old
company
kemper
wanted
to
drop
me
keeping
my
wife
or
tripple
our
premium
because
i
had
ticket
only
points
for
mph
over
speed
limit
well
i
called
geico
and
they
insured
both
my
wife
and
i
for
less
then
we
were
previously
paying
kemper
generally
i
hate
the
whole
insurance
game
i
realize
that
it
is
necessary
but
the
way
that
a
person
can
get
dicked
around
doesnt
make
any
sense
one
good
thing
about
geico
is
that
everything
can
be
handled
over
the
phone
my
suggestion
stay
where
you
are
or
shop
around
but
stay
away

safety
is
an
important
criterium
for
me
when
buying
a
car
i
wont
buy
a
small
car
like
a
civic
or
whatever
great
safety
handling
speed
for
me
seems
to
me
that
you
would
be
more
dead
in
a
small
car
than
a
large
car
after
an
accident
this
is
a
very
simplistic
view
of
safety
assuming
that
you
are
in
a
collision
less
likely
with
a
more
agile
smaller
car
then
the
important
factor
is
how
well
does
the
car
sacrifice
itself
to
save
you
this
is
why
a
thousand
pound
car
can
hit
a
wall
at
and
the
driver
walks
out
and
why
everybody
dies
when
a
suburban
hits
a

at
as
i
recall
for
the
last
generation
suburban
hic
numbers
as
an
aside
just
what
is
the
point
of
an
airbag
it
seems
to
me
that
seatbelts
with
pretensioners
audi
et
al
or
a
good
tight
point
belt
will
prevent
you
every
moving
far
enough
to
hit
the
airbag
you
might
be
saved
from
some
flyign
glass
or
is
an
airbag
just
a
lowest
common
denominator
safety
device
that
is
of
some
use

you

the

the

here

ottawa
has
one
and
sometimes
they
put

on

most
of
the
time
it
stays
in
storage
because
the
museum
doesnt
have
much
room
its
a
big
deal
for
a
car
to
be
canadian
and
thats
why
they
have

cyls
i
have
both
an
and
an
camry
each
with
manual
transmissions
the
has
about
miles
on
it
and
the
about
miles
about
a
year
ago
i
found
that
the
master
cylinder
on
the
clutch
in
the
was
leaking
fluid
around
the
piston
seal
leading
to
air
in
the
system
and
fluid
back
into
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car
i
pulled
the
plunger
and
got
a
rebuild
kit
new
plunger
seal
etc
and
thought
i
had
the
problem
licked
much
to
my
surprise
the
same
problem
developed
several
months
later
this
time
i
looked
carefully
at
the
master
cylinder
to
make
sure
there
were
no
scratches
burrs
or
other
obvious
causes
of
the
problem
i
didnt
find
any
ever
since
i
have
been
periodically
feeding
the
clutch
hydraulins
additional
fluid
and
bleeding
air
from
the
system
i
knew
i
would
be
selling
the
car
and
didnt
want
to
go
all
the
way
to
solving
the
problem
i
should
add
that
the
clutch
is
original
and
that
ive
had
to
adjust
the
pedal
to
allow
maximum
extension
of
the
piston
into
the
master
cylinder
in
order
to
actuate
the
clutch
my
hypothesis
is
that
this
means
that
when
fully
depressing
the
clutch
pedal
the
angle
of
the
piston
rod
attached
to
the
pedal
is
off
the
axix
of
the
cylinder
thus
cocking
the
piston
and
seal
and
perhaps
deforming
it
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
an
explanation
can
you
suggest
a
possible
fix
short
of
replacing
the
master
cylinder
and
getting
a
new
clutch
put
in
now
the
same
problem
except
that
the
above
diagnosis
doesnt
explain
why
all
of
the
fluid
leaked
out
by
way
of
the
master
cylinder
into
the
passenger
compartment
while
i
was
on
vacation
for
days
during
which
the
clutch
pedal
was
not
depressed
or
otherwise
caused
to
distort

can

so
im
not

something
was
missing
horn
buttons
behind
air
bag
in

and
not
in

personal
preference
i
am
seriously
considering
following
the
advice
in
the
owners
manual
where
it
describes
the
procedure
to
follow
if
you
discover
something
on
your
ford
that
could
cause
serious
injury
threaten
lives
etc
something
about
notifying
the
national
traffic
safety
group
as
well
as
ford
those
little
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep
buttons
are
terrible
the
latter
is
probably
because
of
the
air
bag
its
pretty
much
takes
up
all
the
space
where
youd
expect
to
find
the
horn
speaking
of
the
horn
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
probe
comes
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sounding
horns
instead
of
the
japanese
sounding
kind
the
previous
probes
had
japanese
horns
well
i
guess
thats
good
in
a
way
but
in
a
way
its
bad
when
someone
hears
that
kind
of
horn
they
expect
to
see
a
big
american
car
they
may
not
associate
the
sound
with
a
small
jap
car
style
car
like
the
probe
is

yeah
not
very

but
enough
to
be
annoying
sometimes
the

the

is
a
must
i
have
always
been
a
guy
almost
every
car
ive
ever
owned
has
been
a
because
i
got
a
good
deal
on
this
car
with
the
miles
i
knowingly
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
has
an
automatic
but
it
is
a
pretty
hightech
automatic
it
is
a
fully
electronicaly
controlled
with
torque
converter
lockup
even
with
the
automatic
im
getting
mpg
on
the
highway
driving
but
of
course
driving
is
illegal
so
i
probably
made
that
sentence
up
around
town
the
mileage
has
been
around
not
bad
for
an
automatic
of
course
it
doesnt
have
the
control
of
a
but
since
i
do
a
lot
of
city
driving
it
turns
out
to
be
very
convenient
its
nice
to
be
able
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
and
drive
at
the
same
time

that

has

my
main
gripe
ive
gotten
them
to
fix
the
worst
of
them
but
i
fear
that
with
the
rather
harsh
ride
the
car
will
be
a
virtual
potpouri
of
rattles
when
it
gets
older

gl
i
got
about
out
of
the
original
goodyears
and
had
driven
the
replacement
tires
bridgestone
miles
when
i
tradeed
the
car
the
firestones
on
my
probe
look
like
theyre
designed
for
performance
ie
rather
wide
shallow
tread
etc
so
they
probably
wont
last
as
long
but
the
car
handles
very
very
very
well
it
sticks
to
the
road
like
glue
even
on
a
rough
surface
interior
is
very
very
nice
too
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
ergonomically
sound
definitely
fordmazda
did
a
very
very
nice
job
on
this
one
the
car
has
a
much
more
expensive
than
it
actually
is
look
and
feel
to
it
yes
this
cars
stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
having
driven
an
probe
for
years
i
find
the
suspension
interesting
the
car
actually
drives
much
better
than
the
it
is
a
very
firm
ride
and
you
definitely
know
about
each
and
every
bump
in
the
road
yet
the
car
remains
very
civilized
on
even
the
bumpiest
roads
you
hear
and
feel
the
bumps
yet
the
car
retains
its
posture
very
well
if
you
have
passengers
by
all
means
bring
them
along
too
theyll
find
that
they
have
no
room
in
the
back
and
youll
find
that
the
car
rides
differently
if
thats
better
is
up
to
you
well
i
wouldnt
encourage
passengercarrying
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
likes
to
sit
with
his
knees
to
the
dash
as
mentioned
in
the
consumer
reports
writeups
consider
the
back
seat
as
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggie
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
its
definitely
not
a
family
car
also
theres
a
lot
of
glass
around
you
which
i
wasnt
expecting
the
temperature
inside
the
car
gets
pretty
hot
in
the
summer
ac
is
a
must
on
any
probe
from
the
in
particular
sends
out
a
real
blast
of
cool
air
when
the
ac
is
on
max
that
lots
of
glass
you
mentioned
is
what
gives
the
car
the
very
good
visibility
reports
you
see
in
all
the
writeups
most
sportssporty
cars
dont
have
that
good
visibility
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
the
complaints
ive
heard
re
exhaust
system
on
have
been
on
the
gt
of
course
being
a
different
engine
that
is
a
differeent
exhaust
system
i
was
one
of
those
with
an
who
qualified
for
the
free
replacement
since
i
had
already
replaced
the
muffler
when
i
received
the
notice
i
wasam
due
a
refund
from
ford
i
applied
in
february
and
am
still
waiting
gave
me
a
free
rental
car
for
the
day
and
a
half
that
i
was
without
my
car
i
was
quite
happy
with
the
way
they
handledespecially
considering
that
i
was
expecting
the
worst
from
them
yes
i
was
pretty
amazed
when
i
had
my
car
in
for
some
touchup
adjustments
this
past
week
and
they
had
to
keep
it
overnight
too
busy
for
them
to
get
to
it
and
they
offered
to
pay
for
a
rental
they
did
make
me
pay
for
taxes
and
insurance
though
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
i
have
to
agree
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
seriously
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
very
well

i

this
usually
i

this

also
when

cleaning

i

the

through
some

beneath

mine
looked
slightly

there
was
no

i

the

definitely
not

from
the

beneath
the

i
have
to
remove
the

stopper
to

the

seems

a

problem
with

there
is
a

problem
with
the
seals
on
the
taillights
of

complain
loudly
to
your
dealer
and
get
them
to
install
new
seals
it
is
a
known
problem
present
on
most
if
not
all
probes
so
you
shouldnt
have
to
pay
them
to
fix
it
in
my
case
they
fixed
it
on
my
extended
warranty
i
just
had
to
pay
a
deductable
the
work
was
valued
at
something

after
too
many

of
school
im
finally
graduating
and
getting
a
real
job
of
course
i
am
trying
to
make
plans
of
how
to
spend
all
this
extra
money
right
now
i
have
an
accord
a
good
car
but
not
real
sporty
i
was
thinking
of
selling
it
in
about
two
years
and
dropping
around
on
a
sports
car
of
some
kind
after
thinking
about
it
i
may
have
a
better
idea
ill
keep
the
accord
until
it
drops
and
buy
the
car
ive
always
wanted
a
corvette
stingray
my
reasoning
is
that
accord
corvette
is
less
than
what
i
would
spend
anyway
basically
im
thinking
of
a
late
early
for
around
my
question
is
what
are
good
years
to
consider
for
reliability
looks
horsepower
in
that
order
believe
it
or
not
horsepower
is
not
a
main
concern
if
i
want
to
go
fast
i
get
on
my
motorcycle
and
what
are
good
prices
to
vettes
had
the
same
basic
chassis
add
aluminum
weaker
rear
axle
housing
all
these
years
used
same
brakes
similar
springs
etc
late
was
a
bad
year
for
gm
reliability
catastrophic
converter
was
added
in
cheapest
corvette
to
low
end
about
tops
out
about
except
for
those
morooons
that
think
there
indy
aniversity
vette
is
special
these
guys
have
been
known
to
ask
i
dont
think
they
get
it
best
buy
convertables
i
got
my
for
needs
body
work
but
im
willing
parts
for
all
are
readily
avail
at
swap
meets
and
mail
order
etc
reliability
looks
independant
suspension
wheel
disk
and
all
under
and
they
thought
a
miata
was
a
good
deal
also
what
would
insurance
look
like
im
male
single
i
might
wait
until
im
to
get
the
car
lower
insurance
would
the
fact
that
i
mainly
drive
the
other
car
lower
it
is
there
some
type
of
classic
car
or
rarely
driven
insurance
class
for
driving
it
under
miles
per
year
my
dad
has
a
vette
and
its
on
what
you
say
classic
insurance
basically
what
that
means
is
that
it
has
restricted
amount
of
driving
time
which
basically
means
it
cant
be
used
as
an
every
day
car
and
would
probably
suit
your
needs
for
limited
mileage
my
origional
inquires
to
my
insurance
agent
i
can
drive
my
convertable
for
miles
or
less
per
year
i
must
keep
it
in
a
locked
garage
and
it
will
cost
me
of
the
stated
value
per
year
does
this
sound
right
ive
also
been
looking
at
vettes
recently
and
found
a
convertible
that
i
like
at
a
dealer
i
currently
own
an
ford
escort
gt
which
is
insured
through
state
farm
i
called
em
up
and
asked
about
the
rates
if
i
sell
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
if
i
keep
the
escort
the
vette
insurance
is
per
months
the
escorts
insurance
goes
down
by
to
approx
per
months
im
male
and
have
a
good
driver
discount
another
variable
would
be
where
you
live
best
bet
is
to
just
call
up
some
insurance
brokers
and
get
a
quote
state
farm
says
they
base
the
price
on
the
fair
market
value
of
the
car
which
is
determined
by
an
outside
apprasier
they
look
in
the
newspaper
and
call
up
dealers
to
find
out
what
the
going
rate
is
and
adjust
it
for
the
condition
of
the
car
to
get
the
values
above
they
went
on
the
selling
price
of
the
car
the
dealers
asking
price
is
i
need
to
do
research
to
find
out
if
this
is
reasonable
in
any
case
i
told
state
farm
the
value
was
get
an
appraiser
to
look
at
the
car
he
will
check
serial
numbers
and
look
for
origional
equipe
depending
on
what
mods
have
been
done
the
car
could
be
worth
only
problems
like
wrong
engine
trans
wrong
paint
type
vetts
used
lacquer
an
modification
would
reduce
tthe
value

classifieds
in
denver
and
chicago
every
week
i
bought
a
remarkably
clean
maroonred
sho
with
miles
on
it
for
as
far
as
i
can
tell
this
is
about
under
blue
book
and
i
still
have
another
miles
before
the
extended
service
plan
runs
out
as
one
should
with
any
shos
i
made
sure
that
the
car
was
already
refit
with
the
upgraded
clutch
and
pressure
plate
as
well
as
having
been
recalled
for
upgraded
rotors
and
seatbelt
attachments
however
my
sho
does
not
have
the
newer
rod
shifter
i
understand
i
can
get
this
for
from
any
ford
service
center
in
addition
the
car
received
the
full
tuneup
at
miles
receiving
new
platinum
plugs
and
valve
adjustment
for
a
car
with
miles
on
it
the
car
was
virtually
immaculate
the
clearcoat
paint
job
was
devoid
of
any
large
chips
or
dents
although
the
front
airdammolding
was
covered
with
lots
of
small
scratches
not
surprising
since
most
of
the
miles
were
spent
on
the
highway
having
driven
a
smaller
twodoor
coupe
for
so
long
i
was
a
bit
concerned
about
whether
i
could
get
used
to
driving
a
larger
car
to
my
surprise
the
size
of
the
car
doesnt
bother
me
at
all
it
seems
just
as
nimble
as
my
celica
no
comparisons
with
my
oldsmobile
visibility
from
the
drivers
seat
is
excellent
helped
mostly
by
of
the
small
the
quarterwindows
aft
of
the
backseat
door
windows
and
in
front
of
the
cpillar
and
rear
window
parallel
parking
is
a
bit
more
difficult
but
other
than
that
i
love
the
size
in
fact
im
starting
to
appreciate
the
large
trunk
as
i
pack
up
for
a
drive
to
washington
dc
for
the
summer
more
on
the
ride
later
in
this
review
engine
as
with
anyone
even
slightly
interested
in
shos
i
was
very
interested
in
the
yamaha
shogun
engine
i
was
not
disappointed
base
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
is
good
you
can
even
do
reasonable
launches
from
second
gear
although
i
dont
make
a
practice
of
this
the
engine
revs
smoothly
and
eagerly
tooling
around
town
does
not
require
many
shifts
this
is
good
since
the
shifter
is
definitely
one
of
the
weakest
points
of
the
car
more
on
this
later
while
the
performance
of
the
engine
under
rpms
may
be
unremarkable
it
undergoes
a
jekyllhyde
transformation
once
you
hit
higher
revs
at
rpms
a
butterfly
valve
opens
and
you
can
literally
hear
and
feel
the
geometry
of
the
engine
changing
as
twelve
more
valves
open
up
the
engine
soars
to
its
rpm
redline
and
you
are
treated
to
in
my
opinion
the
sweetest
sounding
around
the
engine
inexplicably
sounds
overjoyed
to
be
at
rpm
ive
noticed
that
when
i
drive
around
town
i
constantly
watch
the
tach
to
see
how
far
below
rpm
i
am
to
go
from
rpm
to
you
may
have
to
punch
the
accelerator
while
torque
is
more
than
adequate
it
doesnt
come
fully
online
until
those
other
valves
are
used
transmission
when
car
and
driver
first
reviewed
the
car
in
they
marvelled
at
how
ford
had
put
such
a
wimpy
clutch
and
balky
shifter
into
the
car
i
remember
driving
a
friends
parents
sho
in
and
remember
thinking
about
whether
i
had
the
leg
strength
to
drive
the
car
in
traffic
the
clutch
was
that
stiff
that
was
back
then
the
entire
clutch
assembly
on
my
sho
has
been
replaced
under
a
ford
recall
in
the
clutch
on
the
sho
feels
no
stiffer
than
the
one
on
my
toyota
celica
in
fact
the
friction
point
seems
a
bit
larger
and
more
forgiving
when
playing
with
the
shifter
with
the
car
parked
the
shifter
felt
very
reasonable
the
and
gates
were
where
youd
expect
it
to
be
and
the
shifting
action
was
smooth
on
the
road
its
much
the
same
but
you
have
to
shift
slowly
make
no
mistake
its
a
clumsy
shifter
when
hurrying
shifts
like
when
i
was
initially
trying
to
impress
friends
i
consistently
miss
the
shift
often
grope
clumsily
for
the
shift
and
sometimes
even
muff
the
shift
i
find
this
pretty
amazing
in
a
car
like
this
it
also
took
me
several
days
to
realize
that
you
get
the
smoothest
shifts
when
you
take
your
time
seems
obvious
but
compared
to
my
toyota
and
my
friends
honda
this
seems
atrocious
and
clumsy
someone
on
recautos
noted
that
crxs
should
blow
shos
offtheline
because
of
the
incredibly
clumsy
shifter
i
now
shift
much
more
sedately
and
the
shifter
seems
more
reasonable
when
you
play
within
these
bounds
the
shifter
works
smoothly
with
no
surprises
i
dont
know
whether
the
rod
shifter
upgrade
would
help
at
all
along
these
same
lines
i
initially
had
trouble
shifting
gears
smoothly
again
slowing
down
the
shifts
and
taking
more
care
to
match
revs
when
letting
out
the
clutch
helped
immensely
this
took
several
days
for
me
to
get
the
hang
of
i
think
some
of
my
problems
were
because
ive
never
had
a
car
with
enough
power
to
balk
at
bad
shifts
in
higher
gears
occasionally
i
have
trouble
shifting
into
reverse
the
shifter
refuses
to
enter
the
gate
and
i
often
grind
the
synchros
trying
to
get
it
into
gear
ill
be
watching
this
carefully
in
the
next
couple
of
months
a
quirk
when
i
upshift
and
the
engine
drops
back
to
rpm
i
hear
a
whirring
and
then
a
grinding
noise
coming
from
the
the
engine
compartment
not
terribly
loud
but
the
passenger
can
definitely
hear
it
i
asked
about
it
when
i
was
looking
at
the
car
as
do
all
my
passengers
apparently
this
is
a
definitely
a
sho
sound
and
is
the
gearbox
apparently
called
gear
rollover
replies
to
my
queries
on
recautos
are
at
the
end
of
this
review
exterior
as
i
mentioned
before
i
am
astounded
by
how
well
the
body
of
this
sho
has
stood
up
paint
chipping
on
the
front
bumper
and
grille
are
virtually
nonexistent
looking
at
how
older
tauri
sometimes
dont
age
so
gracefully
i
wonder
what
the
guys
at
ford
did
differently
to
the
sho
bodies
the
body
in
my
opinion
is
extremely
attractive
with
matching
color
body
moldings
than
the
stock
tauri
for
some
odd
reason
the
sho
seems
different
enough
from
vanilla
tauri
to
get
stares
at
stoplights
of
course
this
could
be
my
overactive
imagination
shos
get
fog
lights
a
more
open
grille
a
completely
monochromatic
exterior
and
a
deeper
ground
skirt
in
the
back
with
sho
stenciled
in
relief
ive
seen
a
couple
shos
whose
owners
have
colored
these
in
with
florescent
colors
or
in
black
yuck
i
dont
think
the
car
is
flashy
i
like
it
that
way
i
feel
almost
anonymous
with
all
those
tauri
out
there
but
different
and
distinctive
enough
to
those
of
us
who
care
interior
the
interior
is
what
really
makes
me
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
the
car
the
seats
are
grey
leather
the
steering
wheel
and
shifter
are
covered
with
black
leather
and
the
entire
instrument
panel
is
done
in
a
blackgreymetallic
scheme
the
instrumentation
is
stock
taurus
except
for
the
mph
speedo
and
rpm
tach
you
get
a
center
console
with
two
cupholders
a
large
compartment
under
the
radio
great
for
a
cd
player
an
armrest
that
contains
yet
another
compartment
three
appropriately
sized
coin
holders
for
tollways
i
think
and
a
compartment
for
holding
cassette
tapes
theres
mapholders
in
the
doors
and
an
oddly
small
glove
compartment
i
spilled
a
whole
can
of
coke
in
the
cupholder
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
the
entire
rubber
holder
can
be
removed
and
washed
in
a
sink
hey
im
really
impressed
with
the
ergonomics
and
thoughtfulness
that
went
into
its
design
and
its
a
before
the
interior
was
upgraded
the
backseat
is
bigger
than
any
car
ive
had
why
do
they
need
so
much
space
no
smartass
comments
please
the
driver
and
passenger
seat
have
lumbar
and
side
bolsters
from
what
i
hear
its
not
uncommon
for
the
side
bolsters
to
show
wear
mine
is
no
exception
the
left
side
bolster
on
the
drivers
has
cracked
and
im
not
convinced
the
right
bolster
is
inflating
all
the
way
a
big
surprise
for
me
i
forgot
that
shos
dont
have
a
normal
hand
parking
brake
instead
they
have
the
regular
parking
brake
that
you
press
with
your
left
foot
too
bad
again
im
getting
used
to
it
but
it
seems
a
bit
anachronistic
to
me
ride
the
suspension
is
nice
and
stiff
too
stiff
its
stiffer
than
any
car
ive
had
a
friends
new
toyota
celica
st
seems
tauter
and
is
still
able
to
soak
up
bumps
better
the
sho
seems
stiffer
with
less
ability
to
soak
up
bumps
driving
over
railroad
tracks
is
a
noisy
and
jarring
affair
on
the
other
hand
taking
turns
feels
wonderful
because
the
body
is
so
rigid
and
doesnt
flex
at
all
i
listened
for
that
before
i
bought
the
car
on
the
highway
the
ride
is
great
when
i
drove
the
car
from
chicago
back
to
purdue
i
had
trouble
keeping
under
mph
let
alone
from
trying
to
see
what
mph
really
feels
like
its
a
relatively
quiet
ride
but
the
sunroof
rattles
ive
tried
to
find
out
what
exactly
makes
all
the
noise
up
there
but
it
seems
to
be
the
window
that
rests
on
the
rails
no
easy
way
to
get
rid
of
it
i
think
over
the
past
three
days
ive
oscillated
between
thinking
the
suspension
is
wonderful
and
perfect
and
thinking
that
the
ride
is
way
too
rough
not
for
me
mind
you
but
i
wonder
whether
i
would
advise
my
dad
to
buy
one
for
himself
but
ive
discovered
as
with
the
shifter
if
you
take
your
time
with
shifts
youll
have
no
reason
to
complain
let
me
explain
the
ride
is
worst
when
turning
and
applying
lots
of
power
to
the
wheels
i
feel
the
wheels
scrabbling
for
traction
and
torque
steer
making
the
car
skitter
left
and
right
after
i
understood
this
i
avoid
the
limits
of
traction
and
im
a
happy
camper
again
its
not
body
rigidity
but
the
composure
of
the
car
as
if
matching
the
suspension
the
steering
feel
is
quite
heavy
my
first
impression
of
driving
my
sho
was
how
hard
you
had
to
turn
the
wheel
at
highway
speeds
it
tracks
straight
as
an
arrow
but
when
driving
around
a
parking
lot
the
higheffort
steering
didnt
seem
so
useful
however
its
reasonable
but
it
doesnt
communicate
the
road
to
the
driver
as
well
as
a
ford
probe
gt
imho
its
much
better
than
the
steering
on
my
celica
st
i
wonder
how
bad
this
car
is
during
winter
miscellaneous
notes
gripes
the
rattles
from
the
sunroof
is
intermittent
some
days
it
rattles
loudly
other
days
i
look
up
wondering
where
all
the
noise
went
activating
the
sunroof
is
sometimes
very
noisy
loud
squealing
as
it
retracts
on
its
rails
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
quick
fix
for
this
again
other
days
it
completely
disappears
function
of
humidity
once
i
made
the
connection
between
the
sometimes
awful
feeling
suspension
and
torque
steer
ive
never
complained
about
ride
i
wish
the
seats
had
more
support
under
the
thighs
also
i
wish
the
side
bolsters
would
close
more
tightly
i
hear
that
tires
for
this
car
can
get
really
expensive
i
currently
have
goodyear
that
cost
the
previous
owner
for
four
i
used
to
hate
the
ford
stereo
systems
whose
idea
was
it
to
use
a
volume
paddle
now
to
my
amazement
i
dont
really
mind
and
sometimes
think
its
an
okay
idea
pretty
ridiculous
though
getting
up
to
rpm
sometimes
seems
to
be
a
chore
but
this
is
no
big
deal
there
is
more
than
enough
torque
down
low
i
often
goof
up
the
shifting
when
driving
with
friends
it
took
me
a
couple
of
days
before
i
could
really
shift
smoothly
from
to
gear
hard
to
believe
isnt
it
my
car
has
almost
miles
on
it
my
parents
noted
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
lowmileage
sho
astute
observation
imho
i
wonder
how
long
i
can
make
my
sho
last
i
just
bought
a
book
titled
drive
it
forever
for
tips
in
this
department
the
goofy
parking
brake
pedal
still
throws
me
for
a
loop
i
once
parked
the
car
in
gear
and
then
accidentally
let
out
the
clutch
after
i
started
it
the
car
jolted
forward
and
bounced
off
the
car
in
front
of
me
no
paint
damage
at
all
but
starting
the
car
is
a
whole
new
ritual
for
me
with
that
fangled
pedal
also
i
began
to
wonder
how
strong
that
brake
really
is
today
i
backed
out
of
parking
spot
today
and
started
to
drive
away
before
i
noticed
the
glowing
brake
light
oops
the
drivers
power
window
creaks
when
closed
all
the
way
the
same
thing
happens
in
my
parents
mercury
sable
oddly
all
the
other
windows
work
smoothly
likes
im
liking
the
interior
amenities
more
and
more
each
day
the
cupholders
are
great
i
didnt
expect
to
use
the
keyless
entry
buttons
so
much
but
it
really
is
handy
you
can
lock
all
the
doors
by
pressing
the
and
buttons
together
neat
and
you
can
never
lock
yourself
out
of
the
car
i
really
feel
like
i
dont
deserve
this
car
i
really
cant
believe
that
i
could
afford
it
i
got
this
car
ten
years
ahead
of
schedule
i
love
this
car
so
much
that
ive
been
telling
my
parents
to
look
into
buying
one
i
love
this
car
so
much
that
i
wrote
this
file
i
meant
to
write
a
couple
of
lines
and
ended
up
with
this
if
there
were
a
jd
powers
survey
for
used
car
owners
i
would
have
an
opportunity
to
express
my
incredible
satisfaction
of
owning
this
car
i
dont
like
thinking
about
getting
another
car
but
at
this
point
in
time
im
sure
id
buy
another
sho
for
under
you
cant
beat
it
next
time
with
an
airbag
and
abs
though
insurancewise
this
car
is
also
a
big
win
i
pay
the
same
premiums
as
on
my
toyota
celica
despite
that
it
has
nearly
twice
the
horsepower
other
odds
and
ends
much
to
my
amazement
there
is
no
sho
mailing
list
anywhere
maybe
because
the
sho
registry
publication
has
filled
this
void
i
havent
joined
yet
but
ive
noticed
that
queries
about
shos
still
appear
on
recautos
about
once
a
month
owners
of
shos
are
always
quick
to
respond
and
are
very
vocal
fans
of
the
cars
maybe
some
of
the
most
vocal
on
recautos
ive
put
together
the
responses
to
my
questions
about
the
cars
as
well
as
other
posts
with
useful
information
on
these
cars
ill
be
posting

in

anyone
is

has

what

more

how
can
i
tell
which
version
this
one
is
there
are
no
badges
that
said
so
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
is
the
version
assuming
this
one
the
one
i
looked
at
is
the
version
is
there
a
valid
reason
to
buy
it
instead
of
a
comparably
equipped
gl
which
would
cost
less

cant

that
everywhere
has
roads
in

good
condition
such

and
such
texas
freeways
are
varied
sometimes
a
good
surface
mostly
flat
but
in
ca
is
comparable
and
hilly
wideopen
spaces
it
just
aint
so
given
the
absence
of
other
traffic
and

built
for
eg
most
us
freeways
are
just
fine
the

dealers
would
like
you
to

there
is
a

but
considering
they
only
sold
about

bodies
last

and
the

midyear

is
not

you

are
correct
the

the

here
in
ottawa
has
one
and
sometimes
they
put
it
on
display
most
of
the
time
it
stays
in
storage
because
the
museum
doesnt
have
much
room
its
a
big
deal
for
a
car
to
be
canadian
and
thats
why
they
have
it
if

they
also

heres
my
horror
story
many
years
back
i
switched
to
geico
from
state
farm
to
save
some
i
have
a
relatively
new
sports
car
for
which
we
covered
with
liability
collision
and
comprehensive
with
this
make
of
car
new
models
came
out
in
january
not
september
like
other
makes
the
car
was
purchased
in
august
of
that
year
we
also
had
a
much
older
clunker
for
which
we
only
wanted
liability
low
and
behold
a
vandal
slashed
the
roof
of
the
sports
car
and
we
put
in
a
claim
this
was
in
october
still
the
current
model
year
for
the
car
a
new
top
with
installation
was
we
had
deductible
so
we
should
have
gotten
you
had
to
go
to
geicos
local
office
to
have
an
adjuster
see
the
car
unlike
state
farm
that
sent
the
adjusters
to
the
shop
or
your
place
he
said
since
the
car
is
now
one
year
old
well
depreciate
the
top
by
so
youll
get
on
the
claim
this
will
also
count
as
an
accident
against
you
so
your
rate
may
increase
the
hassle
continued
then
we
got
a
letter
from
geico
saying
claim
denied
your
policy
on
this
car
doesnt
cover
this
i
then
learned
that
their
records
had
the
full
coverage
collision
etc
on
our
old
clunker
and
only
had
liability
for
this
new
car
they
mixed
up
our
cars
in
their
records
i
fixed
the
top
myself
with
some
carpet
thread
and
dropped
my
claim
they
still
charged
me
with
an
accident
i
cancelled
my
policy
and
switched
to
another
company
the
coup
de
gras
came
when
they
sent
me
a
bill
for
an
additional
balance
due
for
the
difference
in
collisioncomprehensive
cost
between
my
sports
car
and
my
clunker
i
returned
the

unpaid

it

it
just

would
say
that
not

will

the

that

know

i
said

myself
its

i
just
cant
find
anybody
competent

the
fix
it
in

the

here

japanese

the
only
american
car
company
that
i
feel
is
a
quality
product
saturn
i
will
not
touch
another
chrysler
product
again
no
way
i
dont

how
good
the
lh
cars
look
good
and
i
will
admit
they
look
promising
but
not
with
the
support
that
you
get
gm
isnt
much
better
thank
god
they
dont
control
saturn
like
they
do
their
divisions
or
it
would
be
just
another
marketing
ploy
dont
get
me
wrong
i
will
be
watching
my
car
which
i
do
like
like
a
hawk
for
the
next
years
i
am
much
more
hesitant
to
say
it
or
any
car
is
really
good
until
it
has
proved
itself
to
me
but
since
someone
else
pointed
out
cd
as
a
source
i
will
note
because
i
used
to
read
these
magazines
that
car
and
driver
has
never
had
a
good
thing
to
say
about
most
chrysler
products
shadow
for
one
always
were
they
moaning
about
the
reguritated
kcar
and
engine
whereas
motor
trend
always
thought
they
were
great
cars
no
car
magazine
is
really
objective
and
although
there
are
alot
of
people
who
dont
like
consumers
reports
i
will
use
them
to
reinforce
my
argument
i
already
know
about
the
big
stink
with
the
saturn
crash
tests
time
will
tell
how
good
a
car
they
are
the
shadowsundance
rate
much
worse
than
average
in
fact
none
of
the
chryslers
rate
a
better
than
average
i
think
the
best
one
is
just
average
excluding
the
diamond
starmitsubishi
stuff
and
the
lhs
you
can
find
bad
stuff
about
the
shadow
try
as
i
might
when
i
researched
the
saturn
i
could
not
find
anything
bad
about
it
there
is
a
great
deal
of
information
about
this
company
just
because
it
is
a
new
american
company
and
it
has
created
quite
a
stir
in
the
automotive
community
for
good
reason
much
more
than
the
introduction
of
any
new
model
lines
of
any
established
company
i
read
an
article
which
had
a
subcolumn
an
i
think
this
imprinted
on
me
more
than
anything
else
some
big
wig
in

said

i
quote
we
are
watching
them
very
closely
come

grow
up
the
foreign
cars
especially
the
japanese
have
been
kicking
our
butts
for
good

the
american

companies
could
not
make
a
good
product
or
support
the
customer
the
way
they
want
these
days
to
set
in
their
ways
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
saturn
was
created
they
are
still
struggling
because
they
havent
learned
yet
they
have
the
ability
the
workers
are
not
inferior
the
technology
is
not
out

their
attitude
is
and
they
are

i
have
taken

looked

i

the

with

control

the

the

damaged
too
considering

two
questions
is
there
anything
i
should
be
aware
of
about

other
than
the

that
i
should

that
there
are

so
many

as
taxis

the

become
a

phenomenon

that
there
is
no

last
time
i
heard
back
in

the

wanted

to
provide
his

henry
would
be
glad
to

hyundai
isnt

manufacturer
in

daewoo
has
always
manufactured

and
i

kia
is
back

such

are

as
i
dont

work
with

most

andre
true
enthusiasts
will
be
able
to
give
you
a
better
answer
then
this
but
ill
dump
my
impressions
ive
wanted
to
own
a
for
about
years
now
came
close
once
but
i
ended
up
buying
a
fiero
instead
biggest
mistake
of
my
life
anyway
for
you
should
be
able
to
get
a
nice
car
but
your
also
set
in
the
price
range
to
get
taken
by
a
nice
looker
that
is
a
pile
of
shit
the
most
common
total
failure
for
the
car
would
be
frame
rust
between
the
engine
and
passenger
compartment
also
look
for
chassis
welded
together
here
oh
yeah
the
price
range
you
are
talking
about
must
be
the
banger
a
if
you
could
find
one
would
be
mucho
more
bucks
parts
for
the
engine
are
pretty
easy
to
come
by
for
an
old
car
and
you
can
even
locate
crude
in
the
jc
whitney
catalog
if
you
have
too
the
machine
itself
is
pretty
simple
they
use
the
spare
tire
for
windshild
washer
instead
of
a
pump
fer
chris
sake
so
getting
it
fixed
by
a
good
bugporsche
mechanic
would
be
easy
since
it
is
midengine
you
may
spend
more
on
labor
for
any
mechanical
work

my

was
that
the

called

a

altima
anybody
know
why
nissan
did
it
this
way
to
avoid

associated

so
for

its
a

its

review
audi
quattro
its
been
a
while
since
ive
reviewed
a
car
but
today
i
paid
a
visit
to
an
old
friend
whose
love
for
audis
has
been
so
overwhelming
that
he
makes
a
not
too
sucessful
living
selling
them
without
further
delay
i
will
get
to
the
audi
servotronic
steering
for
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
what
servotronic
is
it
is
the
name
for
the
speed
variable
power
steering
manufactured
by
zf
and
used
in
audis
and
bmws
i
have
been
outspoken
in
my
damming
of
servotronic
over
the
past
couple
of
months
and
this
was
based
on
magazine
reviews
and
drives
of
the
audi
cs
quattro
and
the
audi
fwd
i
am
quite
happy
to
report
now
that
on
the
the
servotronic
is
inoffensive
i
suppose
that
due
to
the
fat
gumball
tires
the
servotronic
has
been
loaded
up
more
and
this
so
far
has
been
the
best
implementation
that
i
have
tried
it
is
far
from
perfect
mind
you
and
id
be
much
happier
if
it
was
an
option
that
i
could
refuse
but
on
the
i
no
longer
consider
this
to
be
bad
enough
where
i
feel
the
entire
car
is
ruined
the
steering
is
still
a
tad
too
light
but
it
is
accurate
and
i
suppose
the
stiffly
sprung
chassis
sends
back
so
much
information
that
some
makes
it
through
to
the
drivers
hands
so
there
is
feel
and
there
is
accuracy
in
the
steering
but
there
is
also
room
for
improvement
i
consider
the
steering
to
be
better
than
the
japanese
competition
primarily
because
the
japanese
do
not
believe
in
feel
and
engineer
it
out
completely
engine
wheee
what
a
pressure
cooker
with
just
miles
on
the
clock
i
did
not
expect
the
to
be
producing
anywhere
close
to
what
it
will
be
putting
out
miles
later
but
still
the
car
packs
a
terrific
punch
for
a
turbocharged
machine
it
is
very
unusual
in
that
it
encourages
lazy
driving
ie
low
revs
high
gear
it
is
so
supremely
flexible
that
one
could
hardly
believe
that
theres
only
liters
of
displacement
to
move
this
pound
car
around
in
such
a
fashion
with
maximum
torque
available
at
rpm
and
a
rpm
redline
the
car
can
pretty
much
be
left
in
third
all
day
which
translates
to
a
speed
range
of
something
like
mph
a
chracteristic
that
one
normally
associates
with
large
capacity
the
technical
achievement
is
breadthtaking
throttle
response
is
right
up
there
with
a
good
atmospheric
engine
in
fact
it
would
even
put
peaky
multivalve
engines
to
shame
downshifts
are
almost
unnecessary
it
is
more
fun
to
use
the
overboost
feature
than
to
rev
the
engine
for
those
not
familiar
the
engine
features
up
to
seconds
of
additional
turbo
boost
for
passing
sort
of
like
lighting
up
the
after
burners
in
a
jet
fighter
one
could
with
the
right
foot
only
in
third
gear
blast
the
car
from
to
in
just
a
few
moments
simply
by
flooring
the
gas
as
far
as
the
numbers
go
maximum
torque
available
in
overboost
mode
shoots
up
to
about
lb
ft
incredible
for
a
liter
it
takes
a
few
moments
for
it
to
develop
overboost
but
it
is
well
worth
waiting
for
since
this
is
quite
a
heavy
car
ones
body
parts
are
not
flung
around
like
say
the
corrado
the
acceleration
is
smooth
and
strong
somewhat
similar
to
riding
in
a
jetliner
as
it
accelerates
down
the
runway
on
takeoff
also
one
is
treated
to
a
very
distinctive
and
entertaining
whistle
from
the
turbo
the
only
entertaining
sound
to
come
out
of
a
very
refined
but
bland
sounding
banger
yes
audi
has
refined
the
to
the
point
where
at
rpm
it
sounds
as
serene
as
it
does
at
the
smoothness
is
outstanding
but
not
quite
up
to
the
standards
of
a
very
good
eg
a
valve
bmw
id
say
that
in
terms
of
refinement
ie
willingness
to
rev
smoothness
lack
of
harshness
under
full
acceleration
it
is
better
than
many
however
lost
in
the
refinement
process
is
the
characteristic
cylinder
bark
that
made
the
older
engines
so
characterful
if
not
terribly
refined
the
valve
turbo
sounds
pretty
bland
except
for
the
whistle
under
full
boost
subjectively
id
rate
the
vw
engine
as
being
far
more
musical
than
the
turbo
also
audis
own
is
also
far
more
musical
with
a
rorty
race
car
growl
when
pressed
though
none
of
these
can
match
its
grunt
the
only
hint
of
the
engines
true
capacity
occurs
when
one
is
taking
off
from
rest
after
the
turbo
has
come
to
a
near
stop
with
the
extra
inertia
from
the
permanently
engaged
system
one
has
to
be
somewhat
delicate
in
feeding
in
the
clutch
to
prevent
an
embarassing
stall
alternately
one
could
use
more
revs
in
both
cases
a
very
small
price
to
pay
for
such
a
fantastic
engine
i
think
that
audi
of
america
should
offer
an
automatic
option
for
this
car
just
as
they
offer
though
in
extremely
small
numbers
a
speed
for
the
much
peakier
the
characteristics
of
the
engine
are
perfect
for
an
automatic
ironically
in
europe
a
slush
is
available
but
none
is
offered
for
the
land
of
the
slush
marketing
twits
rearing
their
ugly
heads
again
chassis
ive
noticed
that
audis
tend
to
have
very
wide
wheels
and
relatively
modest
tire
widths
the
car
comes
with
firestones
of
size
which
is
not
uncommon
at
all
however
the
very
attractive
spoke
wheels
are
no
less
than
inches
wide
so
there
is
no
sidewall
bulge
whatsoever
combined
with
the
flared
wheel
arches
the
has
a
mouth
watering
macho
yet
subdued
look
on
rough
concrete
it
becomes
immediately
clear
that
the
new
body
style
has
made
significant
advances
in
structural
rigidity
as
well
as
road
noise
suppression
i
suppose
the
two
are
interrelated
but
i
digress
to
use
a
cliche
the
body
feels
like
it
has
been
carved
out
of
stone
flex
is
totally
undetectable
even
when
going
over
rough
roads
with
a
super
rigid
body
like
this
stiff
springs
and
stiff
dampers
do
not
cause
excessive
harshness
and
while
the
ride
quality
will
never
worry
a
lexus
it
will
also
not
draw
comparisons
to
trucks
or
pony
cars
the
servotronic
steering
has
already
been
mentioned
i
consider
it
to
be
inoffensive
because
it
did
not
inhibit
spirited
cornering
i
was
able
to
test
the
cars
cornering
powers
without
too
much
trepidation
i
think
a
new
concept
is
at
work
in
this
car
with
its
fat
gumball
tires
talking
about
understeer
or
oversteer
is
practically
meaningless
on
a
banked
highway
on
ramp
i
went
in
slow
and
started
applying
power
as
i
went
around
i
could
feel
the
g
forces
build
to
the
point
where
the
skin
on
my
face
was
being
tugged
sideways
yet
the
car
was
totally
and
completely
obedient
to
throttle
and
steering
inputs
it
felt
that
the
limits
were
not
even
close
to
being
approached
the
g
forces
were
thrilling
but
the
entire
affair
of
going
around
a
curve
is
strangely
uninvolving
you
tell
the
car
what
you
want
and
it
does
it
end
of
story
i
think
that
i
am
starting
to
relate
more
and
more
to
those
reviewers
who
were
highly
impressed
by
the
honda
nsxs
clinical
efficiency
but
were
unable
to
fall
in
love
with
the
car
the
brakes
have
a
very
good
firmness
to
them
and
stop
the
car
pretty
well
too
though
ive
read
that
they
are
prone
to
fade
i
am
not
too
surprised
since
the
does
not
have
uprated
brakes
over
the
base
audi
fwd
harder
pads
would
help
but
that
in
turn
would
lead
to
a
more
wooden
response
when
cold
i
am
starting
to
see
a
trend
among
the
luxurysports
sedan
makers
where
extra
weight
is
not
being
offset
by
additional
braking
capacity
the
fade
performance
is
nothing
to
brag
about
neither
is
the
or
the
legends
brake
fade
these
days
seem
to
be
a

everybodys
attention
is
focused
on
antilock
capability
comfort
for
a
car
with
such
sporty

its

are

that

to
sway
a

buyer
conclusion
even
though
few
will
be
able
to
afford
an
audi
at
its
sticker
price
of
the
car
is
a
bargain
if
one
takes
into
account
what
it
has
to
offer
over
the
competition
the
valve
turbo
is
a
real
gem
even
if
it
doesnt
produce

no

offers
the

to

re

there
is
a

available
to
reset
the

indicator
on

but
the

will
come
back
on
after
weeks
the

is
in
fact
illegal
in

atleast
it
is
often
the
case
that
the
unsuspecting
punter
trots
off
to
buy
a
used
bmw
and
a
few
weeks
later
all
the
lights
come
on
other
than
that
i
know
of
no
other
tool
anyone
else
about
changing
oil
every
miles
thats
ok
on
newer
audis
they
only
require
it
after
every
miles
i
am
talking
about
an
oil
change
just
a
query
do
you
drive
your
car
very
very
carefully
like
no
sudden
acceleration
etc
if
yeah
then
the
m
oil
change
seems
quite
reasonable
but
if
you
drive
kinda
fast
id
get
a
bit
up
tight
abot
that
thingy
a
point
to
note

the

had

down

some

too
spent
months
in

will
more

not

re
pennsylvania
insurance
limited
tort
option
in
my
opinion
the
limited
tort
option
is
the
best
thing
casey
has
ever
done
basically
limited
tort
means
that
you
give
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffering
unless
one
of
the
following
conditions
is
met
your
medical
bills
resulting
from
the
accident
exceed
x
where
x
is
some
number
like
im
not
sure
of
the
exact
number
the
accident
was
caused
by
a
drunk
driver
i
mean
the
other
driver
was
drunk
you
get
a
good
lawyer
and
have
a
good
case
basically
you
can
appeal
to
regain
your
right
to
sue
but
theres
almost
no
chance
of
this
ever
happening
you
are
only
giving
up
your
right
to
sue
for
pain
and
suffering
you
can
still
sue
for
medical
costs
actual
damages
etc
by
agreeing
to
limited
tort
you
are
essentially
giving
up
your
right
to
be
an
asshole
who
treats
every
accident
as
an
entry
into
the
litigation
lottery
in
exchange
you
get
a
substantial
reduction
in
your
rates
i
save
unfortunately
the
insurance
companies
have
managed
to
scare
and
confuse
people
so
much
that
only
about
of
pennsylvanians
go
for

thats

re

is
this
the
bricklin
was
a

by
malcolm
bricklin

i
believe
was
canadian
he
was
the
first
one
to
import
subarus
and
later
was
responsible
for
importing
yugos
i
believe
anyway
he
had
this
idea
that
what
would
really
sell
would
be
a
sports
car
but
one
incorporating
a
bunch
of
innovative
safety
features
the
bricklin
was
built
to
be
that
queerest
of
beasts
the
safety
sports
car
if
any
of
you
remember
the
early
movement
among
car
makers
to
design
experimental
safety
cars
you
will
recognize
the
general
appearance
of
the
bricklin
big
ol

anyone
recall
other
safety
features
the
engine
was
an

for

thanks
a

i

the

is
the
nada
handbook
for
used
car
prices
no
is
the
blue

value
given
the
retail

wholesale
value
the
blue
book
value
isnt
set
in
stone
though
low
milage
extra
addons
and
stuff
like
that
there
can
increase
the
resale
price
of
the
car
you
may
want
to
head
on
over
to
the
local

or
borrow
your

blue

and
read
up
on

i
paid

remeber
both

i
am
in
the
process
of
buying
a
new
auto
i
havent
decided
yet
whether
i
should
sell
my
current
car
myself
or
trade
it
in
as
part
of
the
new
auto
purchase
i
know
that
the
blue
book
value
for
the
car
is
an
acquaintence
has
offered
to
give
me
blue
book
value
for
the
car
i
am
just
wondering
if
this
is
a
standard
measure
for
negotiating
a
resale
price
or
if
i
can
hope
to
get
more
money
from
someone
else
what
exactly
is
blue
book
value
based
on
i
know
that
for
its
year
my
car
has
low
mileage
it
is
in
excellent
working
condition
but
does
have
a
few
dings
on
the
exterior
nothing
major
do
any
of
these
facts
alter
the
fair
selling
price
of

i
am
not
looking

rip
anyone
off
i
just

get
the

a

will
make
money
off
you
in
three
ways
if
you
let
him
new

markup
over
his

remember
his
holdback
arranging
financing
through
the
dealership
and
screwing
you
on
the
trade
keep
the
deal
with
the
dealer
simple
by
eliminating
buying
a
car
at

cost
is
meaningless
if
he
makes

gets

kickback
from
the

blue
book
you
need
to
know
if
youre
talking
average
wholesale
or
average
retail
is
a
good
guide
to
value
for
a

if
you
are
selling
it
yourself
try
to
get
average
retail
and
chances
are
youll
have
done

be

so
here

explanation
thanks
jim
for
the
good
comments
and
opinion
from
what
i
understand
the
can
only
tell
if
these
microwaves
are
coming
from
the
front
rear
or
both
there
are
only
two
antennas
if
they
are
coming
from
both
this
in
interpreted
as
a
side
bogey
bogey
counts
are
determined
as
sources
by
their
relative
strength
to
one
another
even
if
they
are
reflections
of
the
same
source
it
sounds
like
your
analysis
is
based
on
hypothesis
and
not
actually
using
the
id
like
to
give
some
feedback
based
on
real
life
experince
i
keep
the
in
advanced
logic
mode
and
it
rarely
lights
up
as
a
christmas
tree
the
only
time
it
does
is
when
i
am
in
the
middle
of
a
major
shopping
area
and
then
it
makes
sense
that
is
does
since
there
are
sources
coming
from
many
different
directions
i
have
found
the
to
be
consistent
in
its
reporting
of
bogeys
regardless
of
any
moving
cars
in
the
area
i
have
found
the
directional
indication
to
be
very
useful
in
one
case
there
was
two
radar
traps
set
up
within
one
mile
of
each
other
as
i
passed
the
first
radar
trap
the
direction
indication
changed
then
the
detector
was
set
off
again
pointing
in
the
forward
direction
with
other
radar
detectors
i
would
have
assumed
that
this
was
due
to
a
reflection
but
with
the
i
knew
there
was
a
high
probability
that
there
was
another
trap
and
there
was
on
other
occasions
the
directional
helped
discern
a
false
alarm
from
a
true
alarm
for
example
as
i
pass
a
source
the
direction
indicator
changes
the
directional
also
allows
me
to
focus
my
attention
as
to
where
the
signal
might
be
coming
from
instead
of
having
to
look
all
over
the
place
when
a
car
is
approaching
me
from
the
rear
with
a
detector
that
leaks
i
can
tell
that
the
signal
is
coming
from
the
rear
and
as
the
car
passes
me
i
can
verify
the
source
with
other
detectors
i
would
have
been
unable
to
do
this
and
would
have
had
to
assume
that
there
was
a
radar
trap
when
there
was
none
ive
had

hi

need
your

a
problem
i
have
with
a
mitsubishi
galant
gs
transmission
the
car
has
a
speed
manual
tranmission
since
the
car
was
bought
new
while
shifting
from
to
unless
i
do
it
slowly
and
carefully
it
makes
a
popping
or
hitting
sound
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
customer
service
reached
by
an
say
this
is
normal
for
the
car
is
it
and
about
a
year
ago
at
the
stick
shift
handle
got
stuck
while
attempting
to
put
it
in
reverse
the
shifter
would
not
budge
the
clutch
had
no
effect
the
front
tires
would
not
budge
even
when
the
clutch
is
fully
depressed
if
the
clutch
is
released
the
engine
would
die
assuming
that
some
gear
was
engaged
while
the
shifter
was
stuck
i
could
not
make
the
car
move
it
acted
as
if
it
were
in
neutralexcept
for
dying
when
clutch
is
released
i
finally
was
able
to
release
the
shifter
by
having
someone
rock
the
car
back
and
forth
less
than
an
inch
while
i
depressed
the
clutch
and
jiggled
the
shifter
the
shifter
acted
normally
after
that
when
this
happened
i
took
it
to
the
dealer
they
checked
the
clutch
it
was
ok
they
checked
the
transmission
it
was
ok
i
had
the
exact
problem
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
again
last
week
the
dealer
says
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
because
mitsubishi
the
says
they
have
never
heard
of
the
problem
and
the
dealer
could
not
reproduce
the
problem
while
they
had
the
car
in
all
three
occurances
the
car
was
parked
head
first
in
a
garage
and
since
the
front
wheels
were
stuck
the
car
could
not
be
towed
to
the
dealer
before
releasing
the
shifter
hence
temporarily
solving
the
problem
and
the
dealer
and
mitsubishi
refused
to
send
someone
to
check
the
car
while
it
was
stuck
i
know
there
is
smething
wrong
with
the
transmission
shifting
from
to
and
getting
stuck
at
random
but
i
cant
get
the
dealer
to
fix
it
i
need
your
help
with
the
mechanical
problems
and
with
how
to
handle
mitsubishi
all
hints
and
suggestions
are
greatly
appreciated

clear
things
up
as
to
why
i
posted
the
question
that
way
i
was
debating
with
a
coworker
about
diesels
i
claimed
they
were
cleanerburning
than
gas
engines
he
said
the
extra
junk
put
out
by
them
was
offset
by
the
savings
in
greenhouse
gasses
i
made
all
the
same
claims
you
did
but
one
question
of
his
was
what
about
the
carbon
i
said
it
was
harmless
but
he
wanted
to
know
how
to
get
rid
of
it
i
suggested
scrubbers
i
figured
it
would
be
no
harder
or
more
expensive
to
install
than
cats
does
there
exist
any
designs
for
a
scrubber
id
like
to
know
just
to
answer
his
final
question
i
convinced
him
that
diesels
are
cleaner
otherwise
btw
i
named
my
subject
dirty
diesels
because
i
knew
it
would
get
a
reaction
out
of
people
who
knew
they
were
cleaner
than
gas
engines
and
that
theyd

im
looking
for
information
on
opel
cars
now
you
ask
which
model
well
the
sad
truth
is
im
not
entirely
sure
but
its
a
twoseater
with
rollover
headlights
hard
top
and
really
sporty
looking
my
friend
has
one
sitting
in
his
yard
in
really
nice
condition
bodywise
but
he
transmission
has
seized
up
on
him
so
it
hasnt
run
for
a
while
does
anyone
have
any
info
on
these
cars
the
engine
compartment
looks
really
tight
to
work
on
but
it
is
in
fine
shape
and
i
am
quite
interested
in
it
that
would
be
the
opel
gt
sold
in
this
country
from
to
it
originally
had
a
cc
engine
which
was
later
replaced
by
the
cc
it
was
based
on
the
old
kadett
drive
train
and
suspension
with
leaf
springs
in
the
rear
and
a
single
transverse
leaf
spring
in
the
front
it
looked
good
but
was
limited
as
a
performer
there
has
also
been
some
discussion
in
this
thread
about
the
manta
and
other
models
in
opel
introduced
a
new
line
of
models
the
series
that
were
also
known
as
model
numbers
etc
these
cars
had
the
newer
engine
and
were
available
as
two
and
fourdoor
coupes
a
station
wagon
and
a
sport
coupe
known
in
europe
as
the
manta
at
the
same
time
there
were
two
cars
which
sold
very
few
numbers
that
also
had
the
engine
but
the
kadett
suspension
the
sport
coupe
model
was
also
available
as
the
rallye
with
a
blacked
out
hood
tach
and
fog
lights
but
was
mechanically
the
same
except
for
a
numerically
higher
rear
end
ratio
in
the
sport
coupe
was
also
named
the
manta
in
the
us
was
the
last
year
for
the
gt
in
any
country
both
because
of
the
us
bumper
height
regulations
and
the
fact
that
fiat
exercised
an
option
on
the
factory
that
opel
was
leasing
to
build
the
gts
the
series
continued
in
with
minor
body
differences
in
the
manta
sedan
also
called
the
ascona
and
the
wagon
were
available
with
bosch
electronic
fuel
injection
these
cars
also
had
larger
brakes
and
wider
wheels
these
cars
were
starting
to
compete
with
the
buick
century
low
price
leader
of
the
time
and
were
the
last
opels
imported
into
the
us
from
to
cars
that
sported
buickopel
badges
were
still
sold
by
the
buick
dealers
but
were
rebadged
isuzu
imarks
the
idea
was
to
call
them
opels
instead
of
changing
the
dealers
neon
signs
various
models
of
the
cars
dominated
the
showroom
stock
racing
of
the
in
their
class
and
were
known
as
serious
parts
are
still
available
from
a
number

i
still
have

the

only
any

the

would
be
helpful
if
a

have
then
the
mb
is
not

you
cannot
get
a
manual

in
that
car
in
north
america
it
seems
that
buyers
here
or
maybe
more
accurately
the
distributors
are
not
interested
in
manual
trannies
the

comes
with
a

have
an

and
i
find
that
it
has
sufficient
power
for
any
normal
driving
situation
more
is
always
nice
but
i
cant
complain
i
test
drove
a
saab
cse
last
fall
here
are
my
impressions
awesome
power
especially
over
when
the
turbo
really
comes
on
if
you
get
on
the
power
really
hard
in
a
tight
corner
the
frontwheel
drive
causes
it
to
understeer
heavily
and
then
viciously
hook
into
the
corner
not
a
desirable
handling
trait
but
common
in
powerful
front
drive
cars
the
cse
is
mercedes
is
reardrive
so
it
does
not
have
this
problem
huge
interior
and
cargo
space
the
most
rubbery
shifter
i
have
ever
encountered
i
drove
a
it
was
absolutely
numb
you
might
be
able
to
get
used
to
it
i
dont
know
i
also
didnt
like
its
location
which
was
too
far
down
and
too
far
right
from
the
shifters
position
i
got
the
impression
that
saab
really
designed
the
car
for
an
automatic
it
was
rather
noisy
engine
buzz
rattles
and
creaks
mercedes
does
not
exhibit
these
characteristics

in

you
write
i
am
in
the
process
of
buying
a
new
auto
i
havent
decided
yet
whether
i
should
sell
my
current
car
myself
or
trade
it
in
as
part
of
the
new
auto
purchase
traditional
wisdom
says
you
are
almost
certainly
better
off
selling
it
yourself
if
you
dont
mind
that
extra
hassle
having
a
tradein
on
a
purchase
just
makes
getting
the
best
price
from
a
dealership
more
confusing
i
know
that
the
blue
book
value
for
the
car
is
i
assume
this
is
retail
bluebook
there
are
two
bluebook
prices
one
for
retail
and
one
for
wholesale
you
really
want
the
retail
price
if
you
can
get
it
the
blue
books
also
have
adjustments
you
can
make
for
low
mileage
and
extras
on
your
particular
car
you
should
look
all
this
stuff
up
yourself
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
blue
book
prices
are
averages
over
the
country
that
may
not
apply
in
your
area
for
example
blue
book
prices
are
low
for
california
a
better
way
of
finding
out
how
much
your
car
might
be
worth
is
to
call
around
and
see
what
its
selling
for
if
any
used
lots
have
one
or
looking
in
local
papers
for
similar
cars
and
checking
out
the
prices
it
might
be
more
time
efficient
to
take
a
small
loss
rather
than
hold
out
for
months
for
the
best
price
an
acquaintence
has
offered
to
give
me
blue
book
value
for
the
car
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
an
acquaintance
but
i
would
make
darn
sure
that
i
was
paid
that
is
cashiers
check
in
full
before
delivery
theres
a
real
temptation
when
selling
to
a
pseudofriend
to
be
more
accomodating
than
you
should
make
sure
you
get
the
money
and
if
they
hedge
about
paying
in
full
at
the
start
with
a
cashiers
check
or
cash
then
i
would
go
elsewhere
rememeber
that
you
can
probably
sell
your
car
to
a
used
car
lot
or
wholesaler
and
get
wholesale
bluebook
thats
probably
a
safer
approach
than
selling

that
the
newer
models
have
inherited
some
if
not
all
of
the
qualities
of
their
ancestors
two
major
differences
in
the
running
gear
that
im
aware
of
need
study
my
has
a
solid
front
axle
housing
whereas
the
newer
models
have
independant
front
suspension
the
solid
axle
is
theoretically
stronger
and
the
new
cruisers
do
not
have
independent
suspension
in
the
front
they
still
run
a
straight
axle
but
with
coils
the
is
the
one
with
independent
front
the
cruisers
have
incredible
wheel
travel
with
this
system
more
reliable
than
the
newer
model
but
only
experience
will
tell
the
independant
front
suspension
is
no
doubt
a
compromise
made
to
satisfy
the
typical
user
who
will
never
need
a
real
utility
vehicle
the
second
difference
is
the
type
of
transfer
case
used
on
the
newer
models
im
not
sure
but
i
think
tioyota
went
to
a
fulltime
or
allwheel
drive
system
the
older
landcruisers
have
a
lockup
type
both
have
their
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
cruiser
does
have
full
time
but
the
center
diff
locks
in

the

stated
that
this

since

changed
from
an

no

seems
that

that

the

also
claims
theres
nothing
they

i
sold
my

was
the

although
i
dint
notice
it
being
any
worse
in
humid
weather
perhaps
because
its
always
humid
around
here
i
was
told
by
honda
that
it
has
to
do
with
changing
from
asbestos
to
nonasbestos

which
began
around
someone
could
make
some
good
money
selling

if
its

my
feeling
is
that
since
many

do
not
have
this
problem
that
its
a
poor
design

with

it
isnt
that
bad
at
least
the
bugatti
has
compound
curves
compared
to
the

on

and
the

has

ie

i
understand
that

what
does
this
mean
in

there
a

if

the

pretty

and
cd
isnt
the
whole
story
either
cd
for
cars
is
usually
calculated
based
on
the
frontal
area
of
the
car
so
a
large
car
with
a
good
cd
could
get
the
same
drag
force
as
a
smaller
car
with
a
poorer
cd
to
calculate
drag
use
this
formula
d
rho
cd
s
where
d
is
the
drag

lbs
rho
is
the
local
air
density
v
is
the
velocity
fts
and
s
is
the
frontal
area
note
that
the
pieces
called
rho
are
sometimes
called
qbar
or
dynamic
pressure
a
fancy
aero
term
for
air
pressure
or
force
note
that
power
is
p
f
v
where
p
is
power
lbffts
f
is
the
force
drag
in
this

lbf
and
v

note
that
if
you
put
the
whole
equation
into
one
by
substituting
d
for
force
you
get
a
velocity

term
thats
why
huge
increases
in
power
result
in
little
increases
in
speed
ditto
for
decreases
in
cd
so
if
you
have
a

no
sudden
acceleration
etc
if
yeah
then
the
m
oil
change
seems
quite
reasonable
but
if
you
drive
kinda
fast
id
get
a
bit
up
tight
abot
that
thingy
a
point
to
note
just
because
the
first
light
came
on
at
doesnt
mean
all
the
others
will
come
on
every
too
shaz
shaz
hmm
but
the
service
indicators
that
i
have
works
this
way
there
are
yellow
red
indicators
initially
all
green
indicators
will
be
on
for
few
minutes
when
you
start
your
car
the
computer
will
actually
sense
how
you
drive
your
car
and
as
time
goes
by
the
green
indicators
will
start
to
go
off
one
by
one
and
then
the
yellow
indicator
will
turn
on
and
then
the
red
indicator
will
go
on
and
you
should
get
service
when
by
the
time
green
indicators
are
off
after
service
the
mechanicor
you
will
reset
the
service
indicators
and
the
computer
starts
counting
again
so
i
expect
to
have
a
toolor
a
procedure
to
reset
it
so
the
green
lights
will
come
on
and
the
yellow
and
red
lights
will
go
off
i
wonder
how
people
can
do
oil
change
themself
without
knowing
how
to
reset
the
indicator
its
the
first
european
car
i
have
and
changing
oil
at
miles
is
a
surprise
to
me
and
its
a
big
plus
but
i
wonder
how
that
could
happen
since
the
oil
lose
its
lubrication
ability
over
time
i
thought
its
the
oil
and
not
the
vehicle
that
determines
how
often
we
should
change
oil
any
bmw
owner
on
the
net
response
welcomed
ps
my
initial
question
is
how
do

measuring

at

both

hello

enthusiasts
i
recently
had
more
car
mangled
broken
into
and
decided
to
get
an
alarm
installed
its
a
viper
and
has
a
shock
sensor
sensors
for
each
door
ignition
cutoff
and
automatic
door
locks
i
have
this
same
alarm
installed
in
my
syclone
it
works
great
the
shock
sensor
is
very
sensitive
but
much
more
practical
than
the
motion
sensor
i
have
on
my
other
car
it
doesnt
trigger
if
the
car
is
rocked
gently
by
the
wind
but
any
kind
of
shock
sets
it
off
even
kicking
the
tire
sets
it
off
it
works
great
what
worries
me
is
the
hood
and
hatch
if
someone
could
pry
them
up
gently
enough
then
they
could
bypass
the
alarm
the
shock
sensor
is
adjustable
and
there
are
two
cycles
on
it
you
can
adjust
it
to
be
sensitive
enough
that
there
is
no
way
you
could
open
the
hood
without
setting
off
the
alarm
although
i
know
that
you
cannot
pop
the
hood
on
the
syclone
without
setting
off
my
alarm
now
and
yet
i
have
had
zero
none
false
alarms
with
this
system
the
alarm
tells
you
when
you
disarm
it
whether
it
has
been
activated
in
your
absence
i
have
been
able
to
trace
every
alarm
to
its
cause
and
it
was
not
a
false
alarm
im
also
wondering
how
easy
it
would
be
for
a
thief
to
crawl
underneath
the
car
and
cut
the
battery
cable
to
disable
the
alarm
i
guess
it
would
be
possible
depending
on
the
vehicle
my
syclone
is
so
tight
in
the
engine
compartment
that
it
would
be
tough
to
do
this
there
are
supplemental
power
supplies
you
can
put
on
with
this
viper
alarm
but
i
dont
have
one
i
really
think
that
if
someone
wants
my
car
that
bad
the
alarm
wont
keep
them
from
it
even
with
a
supplemental
power
supply
viper
also
sells
some
fancy
field
disturbance
sensor
that
supposedly
detects
people
approcahing
the
car
this
is
primarily
for
convertibles
i
have
a
convertible
and
have
looked
at
this
feature
in
detail
alpine
actually
makes
a
better
radar
unit
if
you
want
to
get
one
of
these
it
has
zones
in
it
that
can
be
shut
down
independently
so
that
if
one
side
of
your
car
has
pedestrian
traffic
or
something
else
that
would
trigger
an
alarm
it
shuts
down
the
zone
or
rather
pulls
it
in
tighter
i
dont
see
the
real
benefit
to
these
unless
you
have
a
convertible
that
you
leave
the
top
down
on
avoid
the
voice
alarm
that
can
be
added
to
the
radar
package
it
talks
to
people
as
they
walk
by
i
saw
one
installed
on
a
lotus
esprit
the
kids
would
taunt
it
seeing
how
close
they
could
get
before
it
warned
them
to
get
back
the
owner
finally
disabled
it
which
defeats
the
purpose
in
my
mind
im
interested
in
the
opinions
of
you
netters
about
these
problems
and
about
the
viper
in
general
i
am
real
happy
with
my
viper
one
other
feature
i
really
like
is
you
can
tune
it
to
your
preferences
you
can
have
it
arm
passively
or
not
you
can
disable
the
chirp
for
armingdisarming
you
can
have
it
lockunlock
the
doors
when
the
alarm
is
armeddisarmed
i
like
these
features
i
hate
the
chirp
when
the
alarm
armsdisarms
so
mine
flashes
the
lights
only
i
like
the
door
lock
feature
although
i
have
to
be
careful
to
take
my
keys
with
me
because
it
doesnt
know
if
you
have
left
your
keys
in
the
car
when
it
passively
arms
and
locks
the
doors
but
if
you
are
meticulous
about
taking
your
keys
with
you
it
takes
care
of
the
rest
the
car
is
an
ford
probe
gt
that
used
to
be
in
great
shape
ron
garnett
i
looked
seriously
at
the
alpine
system
too
it
is
a
real
nice
system
but
more
money
and
it
has
a
motion
sensor
standard
instead
of
the
shock
sensor
the
shock
sensor
is
betterand
the
viper
shock
sensor
is
better
cycle
than
the
optional
alpine
one
imho
i
think
the
viper
gives
you
a
lot
of
good
value
for
the
money
but
it
isnt
absolutely
tamperproof
no
system
is
except
maybe
the
one
that
james
bond
had
on
his
lotus
in
for
your
eyes
only
anyone
know

we
can

having
several

who
own

i
am
very
uncomfortable
when
i
see

ad
like
this
i
have
known
several
people
who
have
lost
the
seats
from
their
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
support
the
celica
retrofit
trade
and
the
insurance
companies
have
been
very
miserable
to
deal
with
in
all
cases
when
these
seats
are
seen
for

they
are
most
often
stolen
so
it
would
be
nice
to
see
a
statement
saying
where
they
came
from
that
would
at
least
help
to
soothe
the
reflexive
fear
that
someone
is
making
a
buck
at
someone
elses
expense
ill
give
this
seller
the
benefit
of

people
should
be
aware

the
vast

of

on

those
that

lee
btw
they
are
incredible

so
if
its

go

i
am

i
take
very
serious
offence
in
your

i
see
a

of
computers
advertized
on

and
my

just
had
been
releived
of

all
the

are
for

where
did
you
learn
logic
as
for
the

they
were
replaced
by
a
much
harder
literally
celica
gts
seats
due
to
my
back
problem
that
is
why
i
had
to
reuse
the

thats
why
the

that

everybody
settles

the
orthodox

are
using
a

porsche
also
uses

whats
the
problem
i
dont

any
claim

their

stay

they

overdrive
either

you

at

yellow

if
you
shift

the
rpm
drop
to
only
and
you
begin

loose

i
should
point

the
they
put

is
a
detuned
motor
compared
to
the
one
they
put

they
dropped
the

supposedly
for

reasons
so
the

i

i
think
its
important
to
differentiate
your
experience
from
a
typical
accident
hail
damage
is
clearly
not
the
fault
of
the
owner
and
also
tends
to
be
well
publicized
in
the

so
its
to
the
ins

benefit
to
respond
promptly
and
helpfully
damage

doesnt
imply
anything
about
the
likelihood
of
future
claims
unless
you
live
in
an
area
that
gets
frequent
damaging
hail
storms
so
theres
no
reason
for
them

stop
covering
you

they

it

the

this

there
are
yellow
red

initially
all
green

will
be
on
for
few
minutes
when
you
start
your

the

will
actually

you
drive

as

goes

and
then
the

then

are
off

the

you
will
reset
the

indicators
and
the

starts

again
so
i
expect
to
have
a

a
procedure
to

it
so
the
green

will
come

the
yellow

will
go

how
people
can
do
oil
change
themself
without
knowing
how
to
reset
the
indicator
its
the
first
european
car
i
have
and
changing
oil
at
miles
is
a
surprise
to
me
and
its
a
big
plus
but
i
wonder
how
that
could
happen
since
the
oil
lose
its
lubrication
ability
over
time
i
thought
its
the
oil
and
not
the
vehicle
that
determines
how
often
we
should
change
oil
any
bmw
owner
on
the
net
response
welcomed
ps
my
initial
question
is
how
do
you
seset
the
service
indicator
of
a
bmw
derek
there
is
a
perfectly
legal
tool
available
to
reset
the
bimmer
service
lights
it
will
cost
you
from
a
mailorder
and
buying
one
far
outweighs
the
possible
consequences
of
destroying
all
the
electronics
if
you
try
di
it
yourself
you
wonder
how
people
do
an
oil
change
without
knowing
how
it
reset
why
is
reseting
so
important
the
only
reason
for
doing
it
is
stop
the
annoyance
of
a
red
light
staring
at
you
forget
this
in
european
cars
you
only
need
to
change
the
oil
every
crap
anyone
serious
about
keeping
their
engine
in
good
shape
and
extending
its
life
will
change
it
every

filter
dont
wait
for
the

btw
i
just
saw
the
new
on
tv
this
weekend
the
big
changes
a
grille
has
been
added
looks
nice
too
and
some
wood
for
the
interior
otherwise
it
looked
largely
unchanged
they
changed
the
lights
and
slope
of
the
hood
along
with
the
new
grille
otherwise
it
is
unchanged
interestingly
their
lack
of
wood
and
lack
of
a
grille
was
a
big
design
statement
they
tried
to
defy
conventional
wisdom
and
carve
their
own
niche
unfortunately
sales
were
only
half
those
of
the
lexus
and
hence
they
now
join
the
pack
i
still
wonder
if
much
of
the
problem
wasnt
the
slow
start
from
the
initial
ad
campaign
personally
i
like
the
q

the

referred

as
dogs
and
said
they
were
synonymous
the

are
always
meshed
in

and
you
slip

solve

unless

recommend
changing

at

under
normal

ive
gone
without
changing

re

i
agree

ive
never
changed
the

except
when
having
a
brake
job
which
is
usually
at
around
miles
alot

however
i
will
start
to
do
this
as
preventative
maintenance
on
my

also
there
are
brake
system
flushing
agents
that
can
be
used
but
the
problem
is
that
if
any
of
the
agent
is
left
in
the
system
it
can
cause
problems
so
its
been
recommended
not
to
use
them
unless
you
are
certain
that
you
can
remove
all
of
the
flushing
agent
just
for
your
info
i
was
quoted
a
price
of
and
for
flushing
the

in

with

hi
javier
how
are

at

my
old
stomping
ground
was
clevel
vibration
when
applying
the
brakes
can
be
caused
on
disc
brakes
at
least
by
warped
rotors
when
the
brakes
are
applied
there
results
uneven
pressure
on
the
rotor
turning
the
rotors
by
a
brake
shop
will
remedy
this
problem
as
long
as
there
is
enough
rotor
width
left
for
turning
ie
within
spec
there
could
be
some
possible
front
end
suspension
problem
but
a
brake
shop
should
be
able
to
confirm
warped
rotors
by
a
visual
inspection

looked
at
twice
by
my

dealer
where
i
purchased
the

the

they
made
this

worse
the

after
advising
them
of
the

mentioned
on

they
said
they
didnt

of

they
adjusted
the
window

made
it
much
better
however
it
now
makes

do

this

im

ie
if
people
pound
on
the
place
where
the

lives
speaking
of
the

i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the

comes
with
one
of
those
nice
merican
sounding
horns
instead
of
the
japanese
sounding
kind
the

had

i
have
always
been

almost
every
car
ive
ever
owned
has
been
a
because
i
got
a
good
deal
on
this
car
with
the
miles
i
knowingly
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
has
an
automatic
but
it
is
a
pretty
hightech
automatic
it
is
a
fully
electronicaly
controlled
with
the
speed
is
much
more
fun
we
opted
for
the
automatic
for
a
number
of
reasons
but
its
still
fun

in
some
ways
more
practical
no

still
ditto
shakes
and

has
been
my
main
gripe
ive
gotten
them
to
fix
the
worst
of
them
but
i
fear
that
with
the
rather
harsh
ride
the
car
will
be
a
virtual
potpouri
of
rattles
when
it
gets
older
i
too
would

fordmazda
did
a

very

on
this
one
the

has
a
much

actually
is

yes
this

stiff
suspension
isnt
for
everyone
i
personally
like
it
but
if
you
find
it
a
little
harsh
but
otherwise
like
the
car
id
strongly
suggest
looking
into
the
agree
check
it
out
i
dont
mind
it
but
would
say
that
if
it
was
much
stiffer
it
might
be
a
problem
how
about
the
for
suspension
well
i
wouldnt
encourage
passengercarrying
in
the
probe
unless
the
person
in
the
front
seat
likes
to
sit
with
his
knees
to
the
dash
as
mentioned
in
the
consumer
reports
writeups
consider
the
back
seat
as
a
parcel
shelf
no
biggie
to
me
though
if
it
had
been
id
not
have
bought
the
car
but
its
definitely
not
a
family
car
true
ive
heard
that
the
exhaust
system
has
trouble
but
mine
works
fine
i
havent
heard
about
this
one
i
know
that
some
of
the
very
early
probes
and
maybe
had
problems
with
prematurely
rusting
mufflers
which
ive
had
this
problem
and
read
about
it
or
at
least
i
assume
the
one
i
had
was
the
one
i
read
about
in
any
case
what
happened
was
the
weld
between
the
muffler
and
the
pipe
feeding
it
ok
so
im
not
a
mechanic
broke
in
my
case
the
dealer
welded
it
ordered
replacement
parts
and
put
them
on
when
they
got
them
i
suspect
this
is
some
sort
of
design
flaw
or
production
flaw
in
any
case
i
have
an
earlier
model
and
would
expect
it
to
be
worked
out
on
newer
ones
in
any
case
it
is
a
warrantee
repair
or
they
get
the
keys
back
from
what
ive
heard
it
sounds
like
fordmazda
had
some
qc
problems
with
the
probe
and
probably
when
they
first
went
into
production
but
i
think
these
problems
have
mostly
been
corrected
at
this
point
thats
almost
always
to
be
expected
with
a
completely
new
car
like
this
though
i
have
to
agree
that
they
seem
to
have
some
qc
problesm
but
i
seriously
feel
the
car
design
is
sound
and
expect
it
to
do
very
well
i
second
this
there
seems
to
be
some
things
that
slipped
through
but
the
car
seems
very
sound
while
not
perfection

let
me
explain
why
i
feel
the
bogey
counter
feature

a
gimmick
radar
waves
bounce
off
objects
especially
metal
that
is
how
radar
speed
measurement
works
a
high
frequency
microwave
x
band
approx
ghz
and
k
is
approx
ghz
is
sent
out
and
reflected
back
to
the
antenna
off
of
an
automobile
or
other
objects
if
an
object
is
moving
a
doppler
shift
about
hz
per
mph
on
x
band
occurs
is
measured
and
converted
to
miles
per
hour
these
waves
bounce
all
over
the
place
and
they
can
reflect
many
times
and
go
in
many
directions
from
what
i
understand
the
can
only
tell
if
these
microwaves
are
coming
from
the
front
rear
or
both
there
are
only
two
antennas
if
they
are
coming
from

in
interpreted

bogey
counts
are
determined
as
sources
by
their
relative
strength
to
one
another
even
if
they
are
reflections
of
the
same
source
im
certainly
no
engineer
and
really
have
no
scientific
basis
on
which
to
make
this
argument
but
dont
you
answer
your
own
question
is
the
reflected
signal
shifted
at
all
from
the
act
of
being
reflected
if
so
wouldnt
it
then
be
easy
for
the
detector
to
discriminate
between
reflections
and
direct
sources
here
is
the
problem
since
the
microwaves
reflect
how
does
the
unit
tell
if
it
is
a
source
or
a
reflection
take
a
and
drive
to
the
local
grocery
store
that
uses
an
xband

door
opener
you
can
tell
by
the
small

box

the

pointed
down
at
about
a

your

going

when

bogeys

side
the

changes

drive
by
and

change

there

not
at
the
store
i
go

i

i
can

find
one

it

i
pick

for

at

it

there

the

concern
with

does
it

upgrading
their

if
so
it
might
be
worth
it
for
me
to

to
the

i
was
in
the
market
for
a

when
i
purchased
the

but
the
month
waiting
time
was
just
too
much
for
me
since
i
had
inadequate
protection
with
my
passport
life
was
much
simpler
when
there
was
just
x
and
k

and
escort
has
the
best
equipment
on
the
market
and
there
was
no
need
to
continuously
shop
for
a

i
hope
that
the
flood
of
new
radar
bands
ceases
with
this

the
biggest
problem
is
that
the

is
a
shifty
sob
telling

i
hate
that
i
would
never

how
often
you
see

he
also
said

although
i
could

he
wouldnt
let
me
check
the
car
by
taking
it
to
a
garage
suspicious
and
who
knows
what
milage
is
on

so
let
me
know
what
to
check
for
given
theres
practically
no

anybody
remembers
what

mikes
dont
buy
it
all
of
the
things
you

will
just
give
you
headaches
later
on
also
it
sounds
like
the
car
needs
a
lot
of
work
and
as
you
probably
know
bmws
are
not
cheap
to
fix
either
the
owner
sounds
like
a
shady
character
just
trying
to
take
advantage
of
someone
sure
sounds
good
but
you
should
calculate
how
much
the
repairs
will
be
it
sounds
like
you
would
have
to
sink
in
at
least
to
get
everything
fixed
if
not
more
also
never
trust
anyone
as
far
as
mileage
is
concerned
who
knows
how
many
miles
are
on
it
and
how
it
was
driven
sure
people
tell
you
bmws
hold
up
but
you
have
to
consider
any
car
is
subject
to
wear
and
tear
for
all
you
know
it
could
have
miles
on
it
the
thing
you
have
to
remember
is
that
this
isnt
the
last
around
either
just
wait
and
keep
shopping
for
around
you
can
probably
find
one
that
is
better
needs
less
repair
and
has
legitimate
mileage
unlike
the
one

where
the

came
from
with
a

thats
why
it
has
the
econobox

that
was
also
factored
into
the
design
of
the

from
the
day
lee

it
was
designed
as
a
widemarket
carsporty

accessiblewith
room

tweaking
the
cars
you

are
designed
for
a

they
both
fit
those

very

the

a

then
just
sort
of
dropped
into
the
vipers
frame
because
it
fit
and
was
available
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
saw
and
heard
a
viper
and
my
friends
first
response
was
that
it
sounded
like
a
truck
it
sounded
fine
to
me
but
then
again
i
dont
like
the
whiny
noise
that
most
modern
sports
car
engines
make
btw
the
viper
we
saw
was
moving
at
about
just
like
all
of
the
other
cars
on
the
freeway
heading
east
out
of
la
on
a
friday
afternoon
looked
really
nice
though
actually
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
in
the
viper
was
not
the
that
dodge
was
developing
for
its
new
kenworths
i
have
always
thought
it
was
the
exhaust
system
and
not
the
engine
that
produced
the
noise
of
a
car
well
yes
the
exhaust
is
where
the
majority
of
the
noise
comes
out
but
the
basics
tone
firing
cadence
etc
are
determined
by
the
engine
configuration
in
the
case
of
the
viper
yes
we
are
discussing
a
huge
multicylinder
engine
which
will
sound
somewhat
like
a
truck
and
my
understanding
btw
is
that
that
engine
was
designed
originally
with
the
intention
of
being
ad
aptible
for
either
the
trucks
or
the
viper
and
from
what
ive
heard
no
first
hand
knowledge
its
doing
a
pretty
good
job
at
both
and
the
best
exhaust
sound
in
the
world
is
now
and
will
always

advice
on
used
car
hi
i
was
looking
for
some
helpful
advice
im
a
university
student
with
about
to
spend
and
im
looking
for
a
used
car
does
anyone
have
any
useful
advice
they
could
offer
to
a
first
time
buyer
im
not
looking
for
anything
sporty
just
something
functional
and
reliable
less
maintenance

ideas
on
what
models

the
part
about
spending
on
repairs
reminds
me
of
an
article
i
read
in
a
magazine
comparing
the
year
ownership
costs
of
a
toyota
camry
and
a
ford
taurus
or
something
like
that
the
result
which
they
announced
with
great
flourish
was
that
it
cost
the
same
at
the
end
of
the
period
that
was
their
argument
to
prove
that
you
dont
go
wrong
buying
the
ford
taurus
over
the
camry
now
if
i
remember
correctly
the
camry
costs
about
or
so
more
in
initial
costs
essentially
it
means
that
you
spend
about
extra
on
repairs
on
the
taurus
that
is
ridiculous
every
time
your
car
needs
repairs
it
is
extra
hassles
loss
of
time
and
a
dozen
other
things
i
would
much
rather
spend
more
in
initial
costs
than
spend
more
in
repair
costs
did
you
account
for
depreciation
i
seriously
doubt
that
a
taurus
would
rack
up
an
extra
in
repair
costs
over
years

i
only
know
that
the

sounded
a

this
does
not
in

disencourage
me
from

does
it
make

it
merely
means
that
i
think
ford
could
have
added
that
extra
bit
of
safety
and
tossed
in
larger

as
the
wheels
are
plenty
large
enough

to
fit

i
cant
tell
if
matt
is
being
sarcastic
here
or
not
but
to
be
honest
many
automobiles
are
worth
far
more
to
their
owners
in
value
and
investment
than
the
people
that
would
take
them
i
dont
have
figures
on
average
property
tax
in
the
us
or
how
much
of
it
is
allocated
for
housing
projects
inferior
public
schools
jails
or
the
like
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
amount
the
government
steals
from
an
honest
productive
citizen
to
breed
this
trash
is
significantly
less
than
the
value
of
many
automobiles
and
for
those
who
will
argue
that
the
animals
out
there
stealing
cars
and
everything
else
not
to
mention
committing
completely
senseless
acts
of
violence
such
as
rape
cannot
be
valued
in
terms
of
money
because
they
are
human
beings
i
submit
that
they
are
not
human
beings
jim
callison
i
think
is
on
the
right
track
and
chintan
amin
remarked
earlier
that
we
cannot
blame
environment
for
the
actions
of
a
single
criminal
i
couldnt
agree
more
one
could
trace
any
crime
back
to
the
environmentupbringing
of
the
criminal
should
we
let
all
of
them
out
from
pickpockets
to
rapists
to
inside
traders

what
they
did
wasnt
their

re

i
recently
bought
a

detector
you
guys
must
all
think
im
nuts
right
well
i
did
a
little
research
into
ka
usage
in
this
area
and
found
out
that
ka
is
not
currently
being
used
in

state
as
well
as

heres
how
i
found
out
a

friend
who
did
spend
time
nailing

doesnt
even
know
what
ka
is
hes
heard
of
k
which
is
what
they
use
here
and
i
explained
that
ka
is
used
for
photo
radar
etc
he
then
said
yeah
ka
stands
for
k
automatic
duuhh
he
then
went
on
to
say
that
plans
were
being
made
for
getting
laser

as
far
as
going

were
concerned
but
he
didnt

was
consistently
going
off
at

traps
even
the
real
sneaky
ones
when
i
called
the
escort
shop
they
confirmed
that
ka
is
not
used
here
or
in
surrounding
states
they
did
claim
that
laser
was
being
used
a
lot
here
which
i
was
quite
skeptical
of
so
in
the
end
instead
of
spending
a
lot
of
money
andor
waiting
months
for
a

is

know
that

has
been
surpassed
by

ive
never
fully
relied
