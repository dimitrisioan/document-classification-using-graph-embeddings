this

what

underwater
in
murky

im
not

if

refer

patents
by
james
harris
rogers
he
details
methods
of
underground
and
underwater
wireless
communications
for
a
review
refer
to
electricalexperimenter
march
and
june
rogers
methods
were
used
extensively
during
the
world
war
and
was
unclassified
after
the
war
supposedly
the
government
rethought
this
soon
after
and
rogers
was
convieniently
forgotten
the
bottom
line
is
that
all
antennas
that
are
grounded
send
half
of
their
signal
thru
the
ground
the
half
that
travels
thru
space
is
quickly
dissapated
by
the
square
of
the
distance
but
that
which
travels
thru
the
ground
does
not
disapate
at
all
furthermore
the
published
data
showed
that
when
noise
drowned
out
regular
reception
the
underground
antennas
would
recieve
virtually
noisefree
if
you
find
this
hard
to
believe
then
refer
to
the
work
of
the
man
who
invented
wireless
tesla
tesla
confirmed
that
rogers
methods
were
correct
while
hertzian
wave
theory
was
completely
abberant

was
years
ahead
of
his

wrote
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
put
together
a
tesla
circuit
which
was
published
in
an
electronics
magazine
and
could
have
been
the
circuit
which
is
referred
to
here
this
one
used
a
flyback
transformer
from
a
tv
onto
which
you
wound
your
own
primary
windings
it
also
used
power
transistors
in
a
to
years
ago
i
built
a
volt
tesla
and
the
thing
was
very
spectacular
but
besides
scaringamazing
friends
depending
on
their
knowledge
of
science
and
generating
strong
emi
i
never
found
anything
useful
that
could
be
done
with
it
is
there
any
realworld
application
for
tesla
coils
today
david
prutchi
first
of
all
realize
that
tesla
invented
ac
power
generators
motors
transformers
conductors
etc
technically
all
transformers
are
tesla
coils
in
general
though
when
someone
refers
to
a
tesla
coil
they
mean
an
air
core
resonant
transformer
the
tv
flyback
version
tesla
coil
see
the
encyclopediaofelectroniccircuits
for
diagram
has
not
an
air
core
it
is
of
a
class
of
circuit
called
oscillating
shuttle
circuit
osc
generally
oscs
are
highly
efficient
but
this
version
uses
transistors
and
resistors
which
are
very
lossy
devices
typically
tesla
used
active
reactances
instead
of
passive
resistors
so
that
he
could
achieve
efficiencies
of
and
better
the
usual
application
of
an
aircore
resonant
transformer
or
of
an
osc
is
to
produce
strong
emi
for
wireless
broadcasts
how
well
do
you
think
your
computer
screen
would
work
if
we
removed
the
hf
hv
tesla
flyback
coil
from
it
if
we
were
to
remove
from
our
homes
and
industries
all
tesla
coils
our
lights
would
go
dark
our
cars
would
sputter
and
die
our
radios
would
go
silent
our
industries
would
grind
to
a
halt
and
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
using
coal
for
heat
gas
for
lamps
horses
for
transportation
steam
for
power
and
telegraph
for
communication
is
that
real
world
enough
for
you
get
the
message
we
would
not
have
the
convieniences
we
have
today

not

actually
named

both
the

the

both

revolutionized

re

thanks
for
the

they
were
all
good
ideas
and
i
am
looking
at
using
a
couple
of
the
ideas
i
recieved
in
the
mail
today
the
spec
sheets
on
the
mil
spec
version
of
exars
timercounter
chip
it
is
stable
down
to
c
and
sucks
very
little
power
they
show
an
application
for
a
ultralong
time
delay
up
to
several
years
depending
on
the
rc
time
constant
in
this
application
they
have
two
of
them
cascaded
together
the
reset
and
trigger
pins
of
both
chips
are
tied
together
and
the
timebase
of
the
second
chip
is
disabled
in
this
configuration
the
output
is
high
when
the
system
is
reset
when
triggered
the
output
goes
low
and
stays
that
way
for
a
total
of
x
the
timing
cycle
of
the
first
chip
the
total
timing
cycle
of
the
two
chips
can
be
programmed
from
to
x
r
x
c
to
x
r
x
c
in
steps
by
selecting
any
combination
of
the
counter
outputs
to
the
timer
output
the
beauty
of
it
is
the
timebase
chip
would
only
have
to
have
a
timing
cap
and
a
resistor
for
seconds
per
timing
cycle
so
i
can
get
a
maximum
of
seconds
between
timing
cycles
x
or
about
days
of
course
thats
much
more
than
i
need
days
but
the
counter
allows
for
binary
steps
that
can
be
selected
for
the
output
for
the
pellet
puker
after
the
first
days
and
it
trips
it
would
reset
its
self
for
the
next
day
timing
cycle
and
so
forth
power
is
still
a
problem
though
a
few
ideas
that
you
suggested
was
to
bury
the
electronics
in
a
hole
dug
in
the
snow
as
an
insulator
and
put
the
pellet
puker
up
on
a
tower
above
the
estimated
snow
fall
with
a
solar
panel
on
it
to
keep
a
charge
on
a
lithium
battery
pack
i
like
that
idea
this
thing
has
to
work
for
at

six
weeks
for
three
samples
and
the
gas
valves
are

spit
the

give

me
at

a
fair
idea
of
whats
going
on
in

digital

seem
to
have
a
habit
of
inventing
a
sizable
part
of
it
eg
even
when
there
are
only
a
few
samples
per
period
our
displays
a
continuous
waveform
complete
with
nonexisting
overshoots
ive
waded
through
lots
of
manual
pages
and
menus
but
i
havent
found
yet
how
to
turn
this
off
it
doesnt
show
which
points
have
actually
been
measured
as
opposed
to
those
which
have
been
interpolated
either
perhaps
youre
using
the
wrong
brand
sorry
all
hp
fans
but
i
have
a
hard
time
being
convinced
that
their
scopes
match
the
rest
of
their
excellent
gear
one
of
the
principal
functions
i
look
for
when
considering
a
dso
is
whether
you
can
turn
interpolation
off
the
other
important
feature
is
to
disable
repetitive
waveform
acquisition
ie
being
able
to
lock
the
instrument
into
real
time
capture
mode
secondly
i
dont
like
menus
i
want
to
see
all
common
functions
with
their
own
button
youll
have
guessed
i
love
analogue
tek
scopes
id
choose
a
knob
with
printed
legend
over
an
onscreen
display
with
updown
buttons
right
away
the
single
knob
of
most
digital
instruments
never
seems
to
be
connected
to
the
right
function
at
the
right
moment
i
agree
with
you
here
the
only
consolation
is
that
manufacturers
are
beginning
to
pay
attention
to
ergonomics
when
designing
the
menus
however
to
be
fair
it
seems
that
first
time
scope
users
our
students
seem
to
adjust
to
menus
easier
than
navigating
around
the
twenty
or
more
knobs
required
of
a
real
scope
last
but
not
least
you
never
know
if
the
waveform
displayed
is
old
or
recent
noisy
or
just
incoherently
modulated
heck
you
dont
even
know
if
it
really
looks
the
way
its
displayed
digital
scopes
only
show
you
a
tiny
fraction
of
whats
going
on
most
of
the
time
there
busy
computing
things
this
is
one
area
that
newer
dsos
are
addressing
i
recently
evaluated
the
latest
box
from
tek
their
which
seems
to
be
a
worthy
alternative
to
a
standard
analogue
cro
this
instrument
has
a
spec
meaning
that
it
is
always
in
real
time
capture
mode
the
pricing
also
matches
equivalent
analogue
scopes
in
the
range
the
downer
is
that
the
instrument
uses
menus
again
but
at
least
they
appear
to
be
logically
laid
out
there
are
only
three
situations
for
which
i
would
prefer
a
digital
scope
looking
at
what
happened
before
the
trigger
looking
at
rare
events
and
acquiring
the
data
to
have
my
computer
play
with
it
lets
hope
scope
manufacturers
are
listening

one
more
thing
about
the

tend

use

over
the

single
most
common
cause

the

degrees
and
a
power
source
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
looked
at
the
timers
and
the
standard
dual
timers
but
thier
temp
specs
wont
go
that
low
also
two
weeks
equates
to
seconds
per
firing
which
means
one
big
timing
cap
i
have
found
farad
yes
farad
caps
that
have
a
working
voltage
of
volts
and
are
small
in

but
again
the
time

at

isnt
linear
i
was
thinking
of
using
several
timers
chained
together
to
fire
the
selonid
at
the
end
of
the
timing
period
but
that
blasted
cold
and
the
drain
on
a
battery
over
six
weeks
is
the
pain
one
possibility
would
be
to
use
solar
panels
but
this
is
during
the
six
month
twilight
anyone
have
any
good
ideas
thanks
in
advance
wes
firstly
i
would
never
consider
trying
to
make
a
oneshot
timer
your
cap
will
have
been
designed
as
a
ram
battery
substitute
rather
than
for
use
in
applications
where
you
wish
to
drain
the
cap
with
a
constant
current
their
performance
in
some
respects
is
more
akin
to
batteries
than
to
a
normal
cap
the
other
point
is
that
big
electros
are
usually
rated
with
tolerances
so
calculating
exactly
what
capacitance
you
have
particularly
when
considering
the
cold
you
should
be
looking
at
designing
a
micropower
oscillator
and
divider
chain
that
rolls
over
from
zero
to
maximum
count
or
viceversa
once
every
seconds
if
you
were
to
use
something
like
a
clock
you
would
need
a
divider
chain
of
to
give
an
error
of
less
than
one
percent
in
the
firing
times
over
the
six
week
period
of
course
you
could
trim
the
oscillator
to
give
you
exact
time
but
the
likelyhood
of
the
oscillator
remaining
exactly
constant
at
is
low
anyway
i
would
suspect
that
there
would
be
far
more
battrey
drain
in
firing
the
solenoid
than
there
would
be
in
the
timer
circuit
caveat
im
not
experienced
in
low
temperature
electronics
so
i
cant
guarantee
that
this
or
any
other
approach
is
the
best
for
inhospitable
conditions

the

of

maybe
it
might
be
dbv
disregarding
the
impedance
of
the

and
power
developed
using

rather
than

or
it
might
have
an
arbitrary

leading

so
look

connect

that

neither

which
is
going

horizontal
it
may
go
somewhat
higher
than
that
on

horizontal
but
you
wont
be
happy
with
anything
beyond
x

you
probably
wont
be
too
thrilled
with
the
x
on

but
it
will
sync
up
and
display
it
i
prefer
at

since

is

do
that
too
the

probably
goes
lower
than

it
goes
all
the

down
to

which
need

if

it

what

about

we

either
contain

but
we
will
use
the
first
binary

to
denote
the

or
two
binary

orders
it
should
be
added
that
this
technique
of
automatic
substitutions
into
orders
ie
the
machines
ability
to
modify
its
own
orders
under
the
control
of
other
ones
among
its
orders
is
absolutely
necessary
for
a
flexible
code
thus
if
part
of
the
memory
is
used
as
a
function
table
then
looking
up
a
value
of
that
function
for
a
value
of
the
variable
which
is
obtained
in
the
course
of
the
computation
requires
that
the
machine
itself
should
modify
or
rather
make
up
the
reference
to
the
memory
in
the
order
which
controls
this
looking
up
and
the
machine
can
only
make
this
modification
after
it
has
already
calculated
the
value
of
the
variable
in
question
on
the
other
hand
this
ability
of
the
machine
to
modify
its
own
orders
is
one
of
the
things
which
makes
coding
the
nontrivial
operation
which
we
have

what

is
a

what
they

is
to

this

on

measure
the

then
by
digging
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measured
as
they
come
to
the

the
problem
is
trying
to
build
a

that
would
stand
the
cold
degrees
and
a
power
source
that
wouldnt

i
have
looked
at
the

the
standard
dual

but
thier

two

fooling

a

use
the

rely

to
hold
the

if
you

contact
someone

voltage
multiplier
problem
hi
ive
just
built
a
valve
preamp
and
use
a
diodecapacitor
voltage
multiplier
to
step
the
supply
voltage
up
to
approx
as
the
load
resistance
increases
the
rc
constant
decreases
and
hence
the
output
voltage
drops
i
need
as
high
an
output
voltage
as
possible
about
the
circuit
consists
of
seven
voltage
multiplier
stages
ie
diodes
and
capacitors
each
capacitor
develops
about
across
them
and
i
take
the
output
from
across
seven
each
capacitor
is
at
if
i
increase
each
of
the
capacitors
rating
that
will
increase
the
rc
constant
and
hence
alleviate
some
of
the
problem
these
capacitors
are
going
to
be
a
little
expensive
as
i
need
of
them
so
what
would
happen
if
i
connected
a
at
capacitor
in
parallel
with
the
output
and
hence
in
parallel
with
the
seven
capacitors
will
it
as
i
assume
increase
the
c
in
circuit
and
hence
increase
the
rc
time
constant
if
it
does
and
my
output
voltage
becomes
more
stable
by
doing
this
then
i
will
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
as
i
am
experiencing
some
ripple
and
hence
amp

and
this

my

has

beauutful
hp
that
are
digital
with
all
the
bells
and
whistles
including
softkeys
which
i
think
are
a
loveley
touch
that
is
software
keys
you
dont
forget
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
computer
those
scopes
even
with
all
their
neatness
still
make
the
ickyest
looking
waves
lotsa
features
but
ugly
output
and
those
are
the
best
digitals
i
have
ever
seen
ive
seen
a
lot
of
cheaper
digitals
and
they
look
terrible
i
think
the
hangup
with
digital
scopes
is
that
you
have
to
know
so
much
more
about
them
and
how
they
work
on
a
scopebyscope
basis
and
some
of
the
functions
are
typically
presented
in
my
opinion
in
a
counterintuitive
fashion
hp
has
made
some
strides
in
their
series
imo
automatic
setups
are
fine
for
simple
repetitive
waveforms
but
can
give
you
some
crazy
results
on
more
complex
events
where
you
need
to
understand
how
the
scope
is
actually
measuringprocessing
the
event
for
example
is
the
scope
in
equivalent
time
or
in
real
time
sampling
mode
equivalent
time
being
a
mode
where
samples
are
builtup
slowly
by
adding
a
delay
to
the
trigger
event
each
sweep
what
was
the
scopes
actual
sampling
rate
at
the
time
how
is
the
data
being
massaged
after
capture
but
before
display
etc
one
common
misconception
is
the
speed
of
the
scope
is
the
hp
scope
youre
using
really
a
mhz
scope
or
is
it
a
mhz
sample
rate
scope
mhz
single
shot
significance
whose
front
end
including
sh
can
support
mhz
waveforms
important
for
equivalent
time
sampling
the
mhz
input
in
this
case
really
only
helps
you
when
your
waveform
is
repetitive
or
on
a
single
sample
when
you
get
lucky
and
hit
a
transient
event
during
a
sample
time
so
there
are
a
lot
more
variables
in
understanding
how
to
get
useful
information
from
a
digital
scope
i
prefer
an
analog
scope
for
general
use
and
the
digital
for
events
where
i
need
storage
for
later
analysis
or
comparison
when
the
event
is
within
the
capability
of
the

named

both
the

both

revolutionized

by
simulatenously
realizing
that
the

were
affected
by
the
amount
of

running
through

sorry
the

is
the

which
is
the
name
of
a
frenchman
named

who
studied
electrical

the

is
just
an

came
after
the

the

thus
our

however

he
is
right
on
that
one
but
i
dont
know
if
it
was
accidental
or
not
strictly
defined
a
bel
is
the
ratio
of
the
log
of
two
power
levels
and
a
decibel
is
of
a

so
you
have
decibels
for

my

guess
again
these

really
work

the

are
writing

left
for

one
news

quoted
an

as
saying
that

in

he
stopped

one
and
he
could
never

he

re

audio
hz
telephone

have
the
capability

of
to
the
reason
they
do
not
implement
this
is
it
is
not

compatable

the
most
effecent
mix

electrical
effecency
and
intelegability
closly
mateches
a
passband
close
but
no
banana
to
paraphrase
garfield
the
reason
hz
is
used
is
that
voice
channels
used
to
occupy
bands
when
multiplexed
on
a
trunk
line
therefore
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
of
this
band
were
filtered
to
minimise
interference
with
the
next
band
nowadays
digital
trunks
have
made
this
less
relevant
but
the
phone
companies
still
see
no
reason
to
improve
quality
especially
for
free
therefore
digital
chunk
of
a
trunk
segments
still
have
a
guaranteed
bandwidth
of
only
so
they
can
carry
the
equivalent
of
one
analog
line
at
the
clock
rate
of
a
standard
pcm
or
digital
trunk
its
all
historical
here
in
the
uk
the
bandwidth
restriction
apparently
only
apply
to
local
lines
ie
those
used
by
the
average
domestic
client
private
lines
which
are
run
from
the
local
exchange
to
the
leasing
client
are
usually
capable
of
a
higher
bandwidth
if
the
exchange
is
digital
dont
quote
me
on
that

i
was
having

through

catalogues
when
i
came
across
a
range
of
peltier
effect
heat
pumps
intended
for
cooling
components
for
those
who
have
not
heard
of
this
effect
you
put
a
current
through
one
of
these
devices
and
it
pumps
heat
from
one
side
to
the
other
reverse
the
current
and
you
reverse
the
effect
i
think
a
temperature
difference
can
give
you
an
emf
as
well
anyway
it
struck
me
that
you
could
make
a

with
one
of
these
a
power
regulator
a

and
a

the

can
shift
with
an

of
which
aint
bad
although
it
would
flatten
my

in
about
half
an
hour
unfortunately
the
catalogue
didnt
list
anything
more
than
the
basic
specs
as
a
heat
pump
i
imagine
that
you
would
get
a
backemf
as
the
temperature
gradient
across
the
device
increases
if
so
presumably
its
power
decreases
as
the
backemf
increases
until
eventually
we
have
a
steady
state
with
no
current
being
consumed
assuming
no
leakage
if
so
then
the
final
temperature
difference
between
the
two
sides
could
be
set
by
the
supply
voltage
and
nothing
more
although
that
would
be
a
lousy
way

oh

for
an
antenna
gain
is
synonymous
with
directionality
the
only
way
to
get
gain
out
of
an
antenna
is
to
design
in
directionality
the
gain
of
an
antenna
is
defined
as
the
signal
increase
for
a
preferred
direction
over
the
signal
obtained
by
an

a

that
is
somewhat
a
pain
to

what
i
am
looking
for
is
a
stable
ultralong
solid

timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
this
thing
on
the
antartic
ice
shelf
and
measure
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
weeks
every
two
weeks
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharge
different
colored
pellets
by
gas
pressure
out
across
the
snow
then
by
digging
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measured
as
they
come
to
the
different
color
pellets
the
problem
is
trying
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degrees
and
a
power
source
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
looked
at
the
timers
and
the
standard
dual
timers
but
thier
temp
specs
wont
go
that
low
also
two
weeks
equates
to
seconds
per
firing
which
means
one
big
timing
cap
i
have
found
farad
yes
farad
caps
that
have
a
working
voltage
of
volts
and
are
small
in
size
but
again
the
time
of
discharge
at
or
lower
degrees
isnt
linear
i
was
thinking
of
using
several
timers
chained
together
to
fire
the
selonid
at
the
end
of
the
timing
period
but
that
blasted
cold
and
the
drain
on
a
battery
over
six
weeks
is
the
pain
one
possibility
would
be
to
use
solar

but
this
is

just
a
suggestion
take
a
motorola
set
it
up
to
give
you
a
pulse
once
every
sec
or
ten
secs
with
either
a
rc
or
xtal
clock
input
then
feed
to
a
as
clock
input
and
decode
output
for
sec
output
might
have
to
add
a
few
and
gates
or
decoder
chips
to
get
output
and
reset
pulse
back
to
to
restart
cycle
trigger
a
oneshot
from
the
decoded
riseing
edge
the
one
shot
then
goes
to
a
mosfet
to
drive
the
mechanism
to
fire
the
pellet
launcher
these
ckts
require
uamps
of
currentbetween
volts
so
a
volt
gel
cell
of
a
few
amphours
would
last
the
six
weeks
then
take
the
ckt
board
battery
wrap
in

build

box
of
out
of
the

plywood
or
metal
exterior
build
a
small
heater
out

in

to
keep

warm

use

from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectectors
all
they
are
is
a
passive
device
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
as
an
antenna
picking
up
that
radar
signals
that
the
radar
gun
sends
out
therefore
there
would
be
no
way
of
detecting
a
radar
detector
any
more
than
there
would
be
of
detecting
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
unfortunately
youre
wrong
on
both
counts
the
most
common
method
of
implementing
a
tunable
receiver
is
to
have
a
local
oscillator
the
local
oscillators
frequency
can
be
radiated
out
of
the
receiver
via
the
antenna
unless
the
circuit
is
designed
and
constructed
with
great
care
for
a
reference
on

intended
for

components
for
those
who
have

you
put

it

the

you

put

end
up
hours
later
with

thats
only
moderately
warm
same
goes
for
cold
items
unfortunately
the
catalogue
didnt
list
anything
more
than
the
basic
specs
as
a

pump
i
imagine
that
you
would
get
a
backemf
as
the
temperature
gradient
across
the

increases
if
so
presumably
its
power
decreases
as
the
backemf
increases
until
eventually
we
have
a
steady
state
with
no
current
being
consumed
assuming
no
leakage
if
so
then
the
final
temperature
difference
between
the
two
sides
could
be
set
by
the
supply
voltage

nothing
more

from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectectors
all
they
are
is
a
passive
device
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
as
an
antenna
picking
up
that
radar
signals
that
the
radar
gun
sends
out
therefore
there
would
be
no
way
of
detecting
a
radar
detector
any
more
than
there
would
be
of
detecting
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
from
my
rather
rusty
knowledge
of
radio
most
radio
receivers
use
a
superhet
circuit
so
that
the
incoming
signal
is
mixed
with
a
local
oscillator
giving
a
fixed
intermediate
frequency
if
that
is
more
easily
amplified
the
detector
detectors
work
by
picking
up
if
reradiated
from
your
radar
detector
in
britain
where
one
hasused
to

there
arewere

who
hadnt
paid
their

fee
they
had
a
couple
of
long
solenoid
antennae
on
the
roof
and
i
believe
could
triangulate
an
operating
tv
from
the
if
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
if
is
radiated
back
from
the
detector
antenna
and
how
much
from
the
rest
of
the
module
it
might
be
worth
putting

a

for

out

i
bought
an

detector
module
at

shack
for
it
is
a
little

that
senses
infrared
remotes
and
produces
an
output
signal
then
i
hooked
the
output
through
a
transistor
to
an
infrared

the
circuit
works
like
a
minature
remote

extender
in
my

all
remote
commands
are
relayed
to
the
cd
player
hidden
in

it
works
fine
with
my

but
when
i
tried
to
build
the
same
circuit
for
a
friends
vcr
it
didnt
work
the
circuit
appears
to
work
for

you
can

coincidentally
it

i
agree
i
come
at
this
from
nuclear

where
one
often

particlehole
excitations

certain

have
the
effect
of
applying
an
annihilation
operator
and
creating
a

and
it
is
a
subtle
question
the
longer
one
works
with

the

they

are

most
certainly
a

one
ok
ive

i
ask
this
again
if
a

will
there
be
r
cooling
instead

can
anyone
design

dielectrics
piezoelectrics

metal
ceramic
magnetostrictives

notes
to
summarize
this
thread
has
so
far
stated
that
the
only
area
where
holes
are
not
detectable
is
the
vacuum
that
is
hole
particles
only
exist
in
the
presence
of
matter
previous
threads
have
stated
that
holes
only
exist
in
certain
semiconductors
the
question
that
naturally
arises
is
if
the
hole
currents
inside
a
semiconductor
vanish
at
the
point
where
the
semiconductor
is
joined
to
a
conductor
say
copper
i
dont
want
a
theoretical
discussion
here
about
whether
holes
could
exist
inside
metal
conductors
rather
i
ask
for
an

how
to

re
illusion
this
is
not
a
new
idea
at
least
years
ago
i
got
this
little
gadget
with
a
keyboard
on
the
back
and
leds
in
a
vertical
row
on
the
front
it
has
a
long
handle
and
when
you
wave
it
in
the
air
it
writes
the
message
you
typed
on
the
keyboard
in
the
air
this
is
not
news
in
fact
its
where
i
got
the
idea
from
since
it
was
such
a
neat
item
mattell
made
it
i
believe
modeled
after
a
space
saber
or
light
sword
or
something
likewise
themey
my
addition
was
using
a
motor
for
continuous
display
and
polar
effects
in
addition
to
character
graphics
i
should
have
protected
it
when
i
had
the
chance
no
one
to
kick
but
myself
ten
years

is
about
right
since
i
built
mine

just
a

ya
never

once
bought
a
real
cheap
equalizer
power
amp
for
my
car
tape
player
at
one
of
those
motelroom
truckload
sales
and
it
sounded
great
for
a
while
that
is
then
one
channel
quit
entirely
i
opened
it
up
and
the
amplifier
chip
for
the
bad
channel
had
simply
melted
some
of
its
solder
joints
attaching
it
to
the
pcb
i
soldered
them
back
and
it
worked
fine
i
just
had
to
keep
the
volume
a
bit
lower
than
i
did
before

said

which
im
sure
is
a
few
orders
of

higher
in
quality
than
the
pos
i
had

the
point
is
look
inside
before
you
scrap
it

you
occasionally
find
something
you
can
repair
maybe
even
the

didnt

on

ups
well
on

anyway
there
is
no
switchover
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protected

is
always
running
from
the
batteries
via
an
inverter
with
the
usual
condition
of
also
having
them
on
charge
if
the
power
fails
big
deal
the
computers
never
see
it
until
the
batteries
start
to
droop
but
theres
something
like
carsized
batteries
in
that
cabinet
so
it
takes
a
while
if
you
were
gonna
run
the
guts
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
inverter
why
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
thered
be
no
switchover
to
screw
things
up
and
no
having
to
sense
the
failure
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charge
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need

tv
for
about
years
and
one
fine
day
while
we
were
watching
something
i
doubt
if
the

was
the
cause
we
heard
a
mild
explosion
our
screen
went
blank
but
there
was
sound
so
we
thought
oh
we
have
special
effects
on
the
program
but
soon
the
sound
stopped
and
smoke
started
to
appear
at
the
back
of
the

the
brilliant
ees
we
are
we
unplugged
the
tv
and
called
customer
service
only
to
be
thrown
around
by
please
hold
i
will
transfer
u
to
blah
blah
finally
we
abandoned
the
idea
of
trying
to
fix
the
tv
and
got
a
new
one
we
wanted
a
bigger
one
too
after

im
considering
modernizing

i
need
a
little
advice
on
outlet
wiring
several
outlets
are
the
old
two
prong
type
without
the
ground
naturally
the
wire
feeding
these
outlets
is
without
the
ground
wire
i
noticed
at
the
fusebox
that
some
circuits
have
the
with
ground
and
that
on
these
circuits
the
ground
wire
was
tied
to
the
same
bus
as
the
neutral
white
wire
this
is
contrary
to
the
electrical
code
and
should
be
fixed
well
my
house
was
built
just
last
year
and
the
breaker
box
is
wired
the
same
way
there
should
be
a
connection
of
the
ground
wire
to
a
ground
in
the
breaker
box
there
also
should
be
a
connection
of
the
neutral
wire
to
a
ground
in
the
breaker
box
there
should
be
no
other
place
in
the
building
where
such
a
connection
occurs
ie
not
in
any
of
the
outlet
boxes
the
neutral
white
wire
is
a
grounding
conductor
for
the
plug
and
is
not
safe
to
touch
while
the
ground
green
wire
is
a
protective
ground
and
carries
no
current
unless
some
kind
of
electrical
fault
has
occurred
its
safe
to
touch
the
protective
ground
but
not
to
touch
the
grounding
conductor
because
there
is
current
in
the
grounding
conductor
its
outletbox
end
will
not
be
at
the
same
ground
potential
as
its

guys
whats
going
on
here
anyone
seen
this
before
what
is
happening
is
this
you
turn
the
tv
on
the
horizontal
output
begins
normal
operation
this
powers
up
the
high
voltage
and
most
of
the
rest
of
the
circuitry
a
problem
is
sensed
and
the
horizontal
oscillator
shuts
down
after
it
powers
down
the
cycle
repeats
things
to
check
first
check
for
a
shorted
high
power
component
your
best
bet
is
the
vertical
output
transistors
or
if
there
is
one
the
voltage
regulator
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
failure
is
too
much
current
being
drawn
somewhere
also
look
for
shutdown
circuits
which
your
tv
may
or
may
not
have
if
you
can
find
one
that
is
shutting
down
the
horizontal
oscillator
then
it
shouldnt
be
too
hard
to
find
the
problem
from
there

unfortunately
there

thatll
stock
just

the

they

to

sells

noncompeting

what
do
i

by
this
suppose
abc

sells

its
a
pretty
good
bet
that
they
wont
be
selling
any

viceversa
they
also
can
obtain
just
about
any

you
want
from
a

they
represent
who
knows
you
might
be
lucky
to
be
able
to
buy
from
one
of
them
but
id
be
suprised
if
you
do
also
bear
in

that
the

qty
prices
they

you
will
be

try

the

just
a
thought
of
mine
here
since
an

aprox
and

it
usually
drops
below
how
about
an
led
in
series
with
a
zener
say
around
onhook
led
on
offhook
led
off
would
this
work
if
anyone
triestried
it
please
let
me
know
aye
theres
the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
the
equipment
at
the
phone
company
will
think
youve
gone
off
hook
in
the
onhook
state
youre
not
supposed
to
draw
current
which
means
you
should
just
use
your
digital
voltmeter
you
can
use
an
old
vom
but
the
phone
company
equipment
can
detect
that
and
might
think
theres
something
wrong
with
the
cable
look
guys
whats
the
problem
here
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
off
hook
all
you
need
it
to
run
it
in
series
with
the
line
as
i
mentioned
in
my
previous
post
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
on
hook
all
you
need
is
a
voltage
threshold
detector
if
youre
going
to
do
the
series
diode
thing
which
is
the
easiest
just
make
sure
that
the
led
can
take
the
current
i
cant
recall
it
offhand
but
its
something
like
or
more
careful
now
folks
also
consider
the
that
is
forced
on
ring
and
tip
when
the
phones
supposed
to
ring
even
with
a
simple
zener
and
led
setup
you
might
end
up
with
some
carbon
real
quick
whatever
scheme
you
use
make
sure
youve
got
at
least
components
on
the
frontend
also
remember
that
if
im
not
mistaken
the
phone
line
is
a
equivalent
circuit
any
current
you
draw
from
the
or
so
gets
dropped
across
that
thats
fine
until
youre
down
to
roughly
when
ma
bell
considers
it
to
be
offhook
but
dropping
it
that
far
down
is
probably
a
big
nono
the
easiest
implementation
to
accomplish
the
above
tip
rectifier
resistor
diode
v
zener
resistor
v
led
ring
this
is
only
a
suggestiongo
ahead
and
blow
holes
in
it
but
you
get
the
idea
choose
a
highefficiency
led
so
you
dont
need
much
current
to
get
it
to
light
up
choose
values
for
the

im
no
expert
at
upss
but
you
said
something
that
made
it
sound
like
you
didnt
realize
something
on
a
typical
ups
well
on
ours
anyway
there
is
no
switchover
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protected
equipment
is
always
running
from
the
batteries
via
an
inverter
with
the
usual
condition
of
also
having
them
on
charge
if
the
power
fails
big
deal
the
computers
never
see
it
until
the
batteries
start
to
droop
but
theres
something
like
carsized
batteries
in
that
cabinet
so
it
takes
a
while
if
you
were
gonna
run
the
guts
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
inverter
why
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
thered
be
no
switchover
to
screw
things
up
and
no
having
to
sense
the
failure
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charge
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need
it
actually
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
thati
sounds
to
me
your
ups
takes
in
ac
rectifies
it
to
dc
to
charge
the
batteries
and
then
takes
the
battery
dc
and
chops
it
to
ac
again
feeding
your
equipment
this
approach
is
the
easiest
and
cleanest
way
to
switchover
from
the
mains
to
battery
once
your
power
kicks
out
since
as
you
mentioned
nothing
will
know
about
what
happened
down
the
line
another
way
to
do
the
ups
scheme
is
to
use
the
mains
until
you
lose
power
and
then
kick
in
the
battery
backup
with
its
inverter
to
replace
the
lost
power
the
problem
here
is
the
switchover
time
and
youve
got
to
resync
the
ac
in
no
time
flat
unfortunately
most
everything
is
built
around
the
assumption
that
ac
is
available
so
the
ups
guys
have
to
provide
and
ac
output
to
be
usableya
sorta
have
to
make
it

if
i
have
a

then
i
can
assure
you
itll
work
on
todays
phone
system
it
costs
too
much
to
overhaul
everyone

a

recently
i
discovered
that
it

the

this

runs

the
better
the

i
was
wondering
how
can
i
improve
the

is
it
possible
to
improve
the

significantly
some
channels
cable
egress
or
emanations
if
you
will
are
being
radiated
at
free
space
impedance
from
cables
that
may
be
harmonically
realated
to
certain
channels
and
therfore
the
standing
waves
at
wave
will
transfer
efficiently
also
your
antenna
a
loose
monopole
is
also
harmonically
tuned
and
will
be
more
efficient
at
wavelength
multiples
your
best
bet
for
this
research
is
to
use
a

antenna
to
get
the
gain
you
need

tv
roof
antenna

whats

here
first
it

inspection
secondly
the

is
current

the

shouldnt
be
or
only
during
a
fault
condition
the
reason
the
neutral
and
ground
are
tied
together
in
the
panel
is
the
tranformer
on
the
power
pole
has
a
grounded
centertap
secondary
with
the
grounded

the
neutral
this
gives
to
neutralground
from
each
side
of

and
across

so
in

the

whats

here
no
no
nooo
the
ground
green
wire
is
for
safety
no
current
is
supposed
to
flow
in
it
under
normal
conditions
this
means
that
theres
normally
no
voltage
drop
in
it
either
it
is
supposed
to
be
safe
to
touch
the
ground
wire
even
if
youre
grounded
in
some
other
way
at
the
same
time
the
neutral
white
wire
is
as
dave
vanderbyl
correctly
said
the
return
for
the
hot
wire
since
current
flows
in
it
theres
a
voltage
drop
if
you
plug
a
heavy
load
into
a
properlywired
grounded
outlet
you
can
commonly
measure
a
volt
or
so
of
difference
between
neutral
and
ground
they
are
supposed
to
be
connected
together
at
the
breaker
panel
but
nowhere
repeat
nowhere
else
well
almost
there
are
strange
exceptions
for
things
like
subpanels
what
you
can
do
if
you
want
threeprong
outlets
without
additional
wiring
is
to
use
a
gfci
outlet
or
breaker
but
the
outlet
will
be
cheaper
in
fact
depending
on
where
you
are
putting
your
new
outlets
a
gfci
may
be
required

the
best
of

we
have
confirmed

your

may
also
have
special

to
ordinary

sometimes

also
note
that
contrary

popular
belief
in

us
and
in
some
parts
of
canada
canada
is
not
a
whollyowned
subsidiary
of
the

consequently
the
nec
does
not
apply
in
canada
lots
of
things
are
the
same
including
voltages
line
frequencies
and
the
laws
of
physics
but
there
are
a
number
of
crucial
differences
in
the
regulations
where
we
can
weve
noted
them
flagging
the
relevant
passages
with
nec
or
cec
remember
that
the
cec

are
minimal

you
can

by
calling

several
versions
theres
the

is
fairly
incomprehensible
theres
an
abridged
edition
which
has
only
the
sections
likely
to
apply
to
most
houses
and
theres
the
nec
handbook
which
contains
the
authorized
commentary
on
the

well
as
the

thats
the
recommended

unfortunately
theres
no

extra
pointers
in
most
places
homeowners
are
allowed
to
do
their
own
wiring
in
some
theyre
not
check
with
your
local
electrical
inspector
most
places
wont
permit
you
to
do
wiring
on
others
homes
for

without
a
license
nor
are
you
permitted
to
do
wiring
in
commercial
buildings
multiple
dwellings
eg
duplexes
are
usually
considered
semicommercial
or
commercial
however
many
jurisdictions
will
permit
you
to
work
on
semicommercial
wiring
if
youre
supervised
by
a
licensed
electrician
if
you
can
find
one
willing
to
supervise
if
you
do
your
own
wiring
an
important
point
do
it
neat
and
well
what
you
really
want
to
aim
for
is
a
better
job
than
an
electrician
will
do
after
all
its
your
own
home
and
its
you
or
your
family
that
might
get
killed
if
you
make
a
mistake
an
electrician
has
time
pressures
has
the
skills
and
knows
the
tricks
of
the
trade
to
do
a
fast
safe
job
in
this
faq
weve
consciously
given
a
few
recommendations
that
are
in
excess
of
code
because
we
feel
that
its
reasonable
and
will
impress
the
inspector
the
inspector
will
know
that
youre
an
amateur
you
have
to
earn
his
trust
the
best
way
of
doing
this
is
to
spend
your
time
doing
as
neat
a
job
as
possible
dont
cut
corners
exceed
specifications
otherwise
the
inspector
may
get
extremely
picky
and
fault
you
on
the
slightest
transgressions
dont
try
to
hide
anything
from
the
inspector
use
the
proper
tools
ie
dont
use
a
bread
knife
to
strip
wires
or
twist
wires
with
your
fingers
the
inspector
wont
like
it
and
the
results
wont
be
that
safe
and
it
takes
longer
and
youre
more
likely
to
stick
a
hunk
of
wire
through
your
hand
that
way
dont
handle
house
wire
when
its
very
cold
eg
below
or
thermoplastic
house
wire
particularly
older
types
become
very
brittle
subject
what
do
i
need
in
the
way
of
tools
first
theres
the
obvious
a
hammer
a
drill
a
few
screwdrivers
both
straight
and
phillipshead
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
live
in
canada
or
find
a
source
of
csaapproved
devices
you
need
robertson
square
recess
screwdrivers
and
instead
of
phillips
for
drilling
a
few
holes
a
or
spade
bit
and
or
electric
drill
will
do
if
youre
doing
a
lot
or
are
working
with
elderly
lumber
we
recommend
a
drill
rightangle
drills
are
wonderful
can
be
rented
and
or
screwpoint
auger
drill
bits
these
bits
pull
you
through
so
theyre
much
faster
and
less
fatiguing
even
in
year
old
hardwood
timbers
screwdriver
bits
are
useful
for
drills
expecially
if
you
install
your
electrical
boxes
using
screws
drywall
screws
work
well
for
stripping
wire
use
a
real
wire
stripper
not
a
knife
or
ordinary
wire
cutters
dont
buy
the
kmart
combo
stripper
crimper
and
bottle
opener
types
you
should
expect
to
pay
to
for
a
good
pliertype
pair
it
will
have
sized
stripping
holes
and
wont
nick
or
grab
the
wire
it
should
be
easy
to
strip
wire
with
it
one
model
has
a
small
hole
in
the
blade
for
forming
exact
wire
loops
for
screw
terminals
there
are
fancier
types
autostripcut
but
they
generally
arent
necessary
and
pros
usually
dont
use
them
a
pair
of
diagonal
side
cutter
pliers
are
useful
for
clipping
ends
in
constricted
places
dont
use
these
for
stripping
wire
you
will
need
linesman
pliers
for
twisting
wires
for
wire
nuts
you
should
have
a
pair
of
needlenose
pliers
for
fiddling
inside
boxes
and
closing
loops
but
its
better
to
form
wire
loops
with
a
loop
former
hole
on
your
wire
stripper
more
accurate
if
youre
using
nonmetallic
cable
get
a
cable
stripper
for
removing
the
sheath
or
do
what
some
pros
do
they
nick
the
end
of
the
sheath
grab
the
ground
wire
with
a
pair
of
pliers
and
simply
rip
the
sheath
back
using
the
ground
wire
as
a
zipper
and
cut
the
sheath
off
you
shouldnt
try
to
strip
the
sheath
with
a
knife
point
because
its
too
easy
to
slash
the
insulation
on
the
conductors
apparently
stanley
utility
knives
fitted
with
linoleum
cutters
hooked
blades
can
be
used
to
strip
sheath
but
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
youll
gouge
the
conductors
for
any
substantial
amount
of
work
with
armored
cable
its
well
worth
your
while
to
invest
in
a
rotary
cable
splitter
us
hack
saws
are
tricky
to
use
without
cutting
into
the
wire
or
the
insulation
threeprong
outlet
testers
are
a
quick
check
for
properlywired
outlets
about
multimeters
tell
you
more
but
are
a
lot
more
expensive
and
probably
not
worth
it
for
most
people
a
simple
voltage
sensor
which
can
detect
potential
through
an
insulated
wire
not
supplying
any
devices
is
extremely
helpful
they
cost
about
us
at
radio
shack
you
should
have
a
voltage
detector
to
check
that
the
wires
are
dead
before
doing
work
on
them
neonbulb
version
are
cheap
and
work
well
if
you
get
more
serious
a
audible
alarm
type
is
good
for
tracing
circuits
without
a
helper
though
ive
been
known
to
lock
the
drill
on
and
hit
breakers
until
the
scream
stops
for
running
wires
through
existing
walls
you
need
fish
tape
often
two
tapes
are
needed
though
sometimes
a
bent
hanger
or
a
length
of
thin
chain
will
suffice
fish
tapes
can
be
rented
electrical
tape
lots
of
it
seriously
a
good
and
competent
wiring
job
will
need
very
little
tape
the
tape
is
useful
for
wrapping
dicy
insulation
in
repair
work
another
use
is
to
wrap
around
the
body
of
outlets
and
switches
to
cover
the
termination
screws
i
dont
do
this
but
drywall
contractors
prefer
it
to
prevent
explosions
when
the
drywall
knife
collides
with
a
live
outlet
that
has
no
cover
plate
subject
what
is
ul
listing
the
ul
stands
for
underwriters
laboratory
it
used
to
be
an
insurance
industry
organization
but
now
it
is
independent
and
nonprofit
it
tests
electrical
components
and
equipment
for
potential
hazards
when
something
is
ullisted
that
means
that
the
ul
has
tested
the
device
and
it
meets
their
requirements
for
safety
ie
fire
or
shock
hazard
it
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
the
device
actually
does
what
its
supposed
to
just
that
it
probably
wont
kill
you
the
ul
does
not
have
power
of
law
in
the
us
you
are
permitted
to
buy
and
install
nonullisted
devices
however
insurance
policies
sometimes
have
clauses
in
them
that
will
limit
their
liability
in
case
of
a
claim
made
in
response
to
the
failure
of
a
nonullisted
device
furthermore
in
many
situations
the
nec
will
require
that
a
wiring
component
used
for
a
specific
purpose
is
ullisted
for
that
purpose
indirectly
this
means
that
certain
parts
of
your
wiring
must
be
ullisted
before
an
inspector
will
approve
it
andor
occupancy
permits
issued
subject
what
is
csa
approval
every
electrical
device
or
component
must
be
certified
by
the
canadian
standards
association
before
it
can
be
sold
in
canada
implicit
in
this
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
done
with
csaapproved
materials
they
perform
testing
similar
to
the
ul
a
bit
more
stringent
except
that
csa
approval
is
required
by
law
again
like
the
ul
if
a
fire
was
caused
by
noncsaapproved
equipment
your
insurance
company
may
not
have
to
pay
the
claim
in
canada
there
is
a
branch
organization
of
the
ul
called
ulc
ul
of
canada
ulc
does
not
have
power
of
law
and
seems
to
be
more
a
liason
group
between
the
csa
and
insurance
companies
subject
are
there
any
cheaper
easier
to

try
to
make

that
the
book
is
based
on
the
latest
nec
revision
which
is
currently
canada
ps
knight
authors
and
publishes
a
book
called
electrical
code
simplified
there
appears
to
be
a
version
published
specific
to
each
province
and
is
very
tied
into
the
appropriate
provincial
code
it
focuses
on
residential
wiring
and
is
indispensible
for
canadian
diyers
it
is
better
to
get
this
book
than
the
cec
unless
you
do
a
lot
of
wiring
or
answer
questions
on
the
net
it
is
updated
each
time
the
provincial
codes
are
this
book
is
available
at
all
diy
and
hardware
stores
for
less
than
subject
inspections
how
and
what
why
should
i
get
my
wiring
inspected
most
jurisdictions
require
that
you
obtain
a
permit
and
inspections
of
any
wiring
that
is
done
amongst
other
more
mundane
bureaucratic
reasons
like
insurance
companies
not
liking
to
have
to
pay
claims
a
permit
and
inspections
provides
some
assurance
that
you
your
family
your
neighbors
or
subsequent
owners
of
your
home
dont
get
killed
or
lose
their
homes
one
night
due
to
a
sloppy
wiring
job
most
jurisdictions
have
the
power
to
order
you
to
vacate
your
home
or
order
you
to
tear
out
any
wiring
done
without
a
permit
california
for
instance
is
particularly
nasty
about
this
if
fire
starts
in
your
home
and
uninspected
wiring
is
at
fault
insurance
companies
will
often
refuse
to
pay
the
damage
claims
in
general
the
process
goes
like
this
you
apply
to
your
local
inspections
office
or
building
department
for
a
permit
you
should
have
a
sketch
or
detailed
drawing
of
what
you
plan
on
doing
this
is
a
good
time
to
ask
questions
on
any
things
youre
not
sure
of
if
youre
doing
major
work
they
may
impose
special
conditions
on
you
require
loading
calculations
and
ask
other
questions
at
this
point
they
will
tell
you
which
inspections
you
will
need
if
youre
installing
a
main
panel
you
will
need
to
have
the
panel
and
service
connections
inspected
before
your
power
utility
will
provide
a
connection
this
is
sometimes
done
by
the
local
power
authority
rather
than
the
usual
inspectors
after
installing
the
boxes
and
wiring
but
before
the
insulationwalls
go
up
you
will
need
a
roughin
inspection
after
the
walls
are
up
and
the
wiring
is
complete
you
will
need
a
final
inspection
subject
my
house
doesnt
meet
some
of
these
rules
and
regulations
do
i
have
to
upgrade
in
general
there
is
no
requirement
to
upgrade
older
dwellings
though
there
are
some
exceptions
ie
smoke
detectors
in
some
cases
however
any
new
work
must
be
done
according
to
the
latest
electrical
code
also
if
you
do
major
work
you
may
be
required
to
upgrade
certain
existing
portions
or
all
of
your
system
check
with
your
local
electrical
inspector
subject
a
word
on
voltages
one
thing
where
things
might
get
a
bit
confusing
is
the
different
numbers
people
bandy
about
for
the
voltage
of
a
circuit
one
person
might
talk
about
another
or
another
these
are
all
in
fact
exactly
the
same
thing
in
north
america
the
utility
companies
are
required
to
supply
a
splitphase
volt
feed
to
your
house
this
works
out
as
two
legs
additionally
since
there
are
resistive
voltage
drops
in
the
house
wiring
its
not
unreasonable
to
find
has
dropped
to
or
has
dropped
to
by
the
time
the
power
reaches
a
wall
outlet
especially
at
the
end
of
an
extension
cord
or
long
circuit
run
for
a
number
of
reasons
some
historical
some
simple
personal
orneryness
different
people
choose
call
them
by
slightly
different
numbers
this
faq
has
chosen
to
be
consistent
with
calling
them
and
except
when
actually
saying
what
the
measured
voltage
will
be
confusing
a
bit
just
ignore
it
one
thing
that
might
make
this
a
little
more
understandable
is
that
the
nameplates
on
equipment
ofen
show
the
lower
ie
instead
of
value
what
this
implies
is
that
the
device
is
designed
to
operate
properly
when
the
voltage
drops
that
low
is
not
the
same
as
is
the
voltage
between
phases
of
a
y
circuit
that
is
from
neutral
to
any
hot
is
the
voltage
between
phases
of
a
y
circuit
thats
from
hot
to
neutral
in
keeping
with
versus
strangeness
motors
intended
to
run
on
three
phase
are
often
labelled
as
subject
what
does
an
electrical
service
look
like
there
are
logically
four
wires
involved
with
supplying
the
main
panel
with
power
three
of
them
will
come
from
the
utility
pole
and
a
fourth
bare
wire
comes
from
elsewhere
the
bare
wire
is
connected
to
one
or
more
long
metal
bars
pounded
into
the
ground
or
to
a
wire
buried
in
the
foundation
or
sometimes
to
the
water
supply
pipe
has
to
be
metal
continuous
to
where
the
main
water
pipe
entering
the
house
watch
out
for
galvanic
action
conductivity
breaks
often
between
copper
and
iron
pipe
this
is
the
grounding
conductor
it
is
there
to
make
sure
that
the
third
prong
on
your
outlets
is
connected
to
ground
this
wire
normally
carries
no
current
one
of
the
other
wires
will
be
white
or
black
with
white
or
yellow
stripes
or
sometimes
simply
black
it
is
the
neutral
wire
it
is
connected
to
the
centre
tap
cec
center
tap
in
the
nec
of
the
distribution
transformer
supplying
the
power
it
is
connected
to
the
grounding
conductor
in
only
one
place
often
inside
the
panel
the
neutral
and
ground
should
not
be
connected
anywhere
else
otherwise
weird
andor
dangerous
things
may
happen
furthermore
there
should
only
be
one
grounding
system
in
a
home
some
codes
require
more
than
one
grounding
electrode
these
will
be
connected
together
or
connected
to
the
neutral
at
a
common
point
still
one
grounding
system
adding
additional
grounding
electrodes
connected
to
other
portions
of
the
house
wiring
is
unsafe
and
contrary
to
code
if
you
add
a
subpanel
the
ground
and
neutral
are
usually
brought
as
separate
conductors
from
the
main
panel
and
are
not
connected
together
in
the
subpanel
ie
still
only
one
neutralground
connection
however
in
some
situations
certain
categories
of
separate
buildings
you
actually
do
have
to
provide
a
second
grounding
electrode
consult
your
inspector
the
other
two
wires
will
usually
be
black
and
are
the
hot
wires
they
are
attached
to
the
distribution
transformer
as
well
the
two
black
wires
are
degrees
out
of
phase
with
each
other
this
means
if
you
connect
something
to
both
hot
wires
the
voltage
will
be
volts
if
you
connect
something
to
the
white
and
either
of
the
two
blacks
you
will
get
some
panels
seem
to
only
have
three
wires
coming
into
them
this
is
either
because
the
neutral
and
ground
are
connected
together
at
a
different
point
eg
the
meter
or
pole
and
one
wire
is
doing
dualduty
as
both
neutral
and
ground
or
in
some
rare
occasions
the
service
has
only
one
hot
wire
only
service
subject
what
is
a
circuit
inside
the
panel
connections
are
made
to
the
incoming
wires
these
connections
are
then
used
to
supply
power
to
selected
portions
of
the
home
there
are
three
different
combinations
one
hot
one
neutral
and
ground
circuit
two
hots
no
neutral
and
ground
circuit
two
hots
neutral
and
ground
circuit
neutral
andor
two
circuits
with
a
common
neutral
is
used
for
most
circuits
supplying
receptacles
and
lighting
within
your
house
is
usually
used
for
supplying
power
to
major
appliances
such
as
stoves
and
dryers
they
often
have
need
for
both
and
or
for
bringing
several
circuits
from
the
panel
box
to
a
distribution
point
is
usually
for
special
motor
circuits
electric
heaters
or
air
conditioners
note
in
the
us
the
nec
frequently
permits
a
circuit
similar
to
be
used
for
stoves
and
dryers
namely
that
there
are
two
hot
wires
and
a
wire
that
does
dual
duty
as
neutral
and
ground
and
is
connected
to
the
frame

you
will
sometimes
see
wired
with
just
a
black
white

ground
wire
since
the

hot
in
this
case
both
the
nec
and
cec
requires
that
the
white

be
permanently
marked
at
the
ends
to
indicate
that
it
is
a

usually
done
with

each
circuit
is
attached
to

there
are
in
a
few
locales
circuits
that
look

some
places
require

grounding
versus
grounded
versus
neutral
according
to
the
terminology
in
the
cec
and
nec
the
grounding
conductor
is
for
the
safety
ground
ie
the
green
or
bare
wire
the
word
neutral
is
reserved
for
the
white
when
you
have
a
circuit
with
more
than
one
hot
wire
since
the
white
wire
is
connected
to
neutral
and
the
grounding
conductor
inside
the
panel
the
proper
term
is
grounded
conductor
however
the
potential
confusion
between
grounded
conductor
and
grounding
conductor
can
lead
to
potentially
lethal
mistakes
you
should
never
use
the
bare
wire
as
a
grounded
conductor
or
white
wire
as
the
grounding
conductor
even
though
they
are
connected
together
in
the
panel
but
not
in
subpanels
subpanels
are
fed
neutral
and
ground
separately
from
the
main
panel
usually
in
the
trade
and
in
common
usage
the
word
neutral
is
used
for
grounded
conductor
this
faq
uses
neutral
simply
to
avoid
potential
confusion
we
recommend
that
you
use
neutral
too
thus
the
white
wire
is
always
except
in
some
light
switch
applications
neutral
not
ground
subject
what
does
a
fuse
or
breaker
do
what
are
the
differences
fuses
and
circuit
breakers
are
designed
to
interrupt
the
power
to
a
circuit
when
the
current
flow
exceeds
safe
levels
for
example
if
your
toaster
shorts
out
a
fuse
or
breaker
should
trip
protecting
the
wiring
in
the
walls
from
melting
as
such
fuses
and
breakers
are
primarily
intended
to
protect
the
wiring
ul
or
csa
approval
supposedly
indicates
that
the
equipment
itself
wont
cause
a
fire
fuses
contain
a
narrow
strip
of
metal
which
is
designed
to
melt
safely
when
the
current
exceeds
the
rated
value
thereby
interrupting
the
power
to
the
circuit
fuses
trip
relatively
fast
which
can
sometimes
be
a
problem
with
motors
which
have
large
startup
current
surges
for
motor
circuits
you
can
use
a
timedelay
fuse
one
brand
is
fusetron
which
will
avoid
tripping
on
momentary
overloads
a
fusetron
looks
like
a
springloaded
fuse
a
fuse
can
only
trip
once
then
it
must
be
replaced
breakers
are
fairly
complicated
mechanical
devices
they
usually
consist
of
one
spring
loaded
contact
which
is
latched
into
position
against
another
contact
when
the
current
flow
through
the
device
exceeds
the
rated
value
a
bimetallic
strip
heats
up
and
bends
by
bending
it
trips
the
latch
and
the
spring
pulls
the
contacts
apart
circuit
breakers
behave
similarly
to
fusetrons
that
is
they
tend
to
take
longer
to
trip
at
moderate
overloads
than
ordinary
fuses
with
high
overloads
they
trip
quickly
breakers
can
be
reset
a
finite
number
of
times
each
time
they
trip
or
are
thrown
when
the
circuit
is
in
use
some
arcing
takes
place
which
damages
the
contacts
thus
breakers
should
not
be
used
in
place
of
switches
unless
they
are
specially
listed
for
the
purpose
neither
fuses
nor
breakers
limit
the
current
per
se
a
dead
short
on
a
circuit
can
cause
hundreds
or
sometimes
even
thousands
of
amperes
to
flow
for
a
short
period
of
time
which
can
often
cause
severe
damage
subject
breakers
cant
i
use
fuses
statistics
show
that
fuse
panels
have
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
causing
a
fire
than
breaker
panels
this
is
usually
due
to
the
fuse
being
loosely
screwed
in
or
the
contacts
corroding
and
heating
up
over
time
or
the
wrong
size
fuse
being
installed
or
the
proverbial
replace
the
fuse
with
a
penny
trick
since
breakers
are
more
permanently
installed
and
have
better
connection
mechanisms
the
risk
of
fire
is
considerably
less
fuses
are
prone
to
explode
under
extremely
high

many
jurisdictions

no
longer
permit

the

rare
circumstances
requiring
the
special

some
devices
notably
certain
large
air
conditioners
require
fuse
protection
in

to

there

where
do
these

come
from
there
are
two
considerations
voltage
drop

heat
buildup
the
smaller
the

is
the
higher
the
resistance
is
when
the
resistance
is
higher
the
wire
heats
up
more
and
there
is
more
voltage
drop
in
the
wiring
the
former
is
why
you
need
highertemperature
insulation
andor
bigger
wires
for
use
in
conduit
the
latter
is
why
you
should
use
larger
wire
for
long
runs
neither
effect
is
very
significant
over
very
short
distances
there
are
some
very
specific
exceptions
where
use
of
smaller

is
allowed
the
obvious
one
is
the
line

on
most

in

you
strip

about

then
twist

though
some
wirenuts
advertise

anyways
its
more
mechanically

there
are
many
different

should
check
that

gimble

use
a

sometimes
its
a
good

to
trim

make
sure
it

some
people
wrap
the

with
electrical
tape
this
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
the
inspector
may
tear
it
off
during
an

its
usually
done
because

a

is
a

interrupter
it
measures
the
current
current
flowing
through
the
hot
wire
and
the
neutral
wire
if
they
differ
by
more
than
a
few
milliamps
the
presumption
is
that
current
is
leaking
to
ground
via
some
other
path
this
may
be
because
of
a
short
circuit
to
the
chassis
of
an
appliance
or
to
the
ground
lead
or
through
a
person
any
of
these
situations
is
hazardous
so
the
gfci
trips
breaking
the
circuit
gfcis
do
not
protect
against
all
kinds
of
electric
shocks
if
for
example
you
simultaneously
touched
the
hot
and
neutral
leads
of
a
circuit
and
no
part
of
you
was
grounded
a
gfci
wouldnt
help
all
of
the
current
that
passed
from
the
hot
lead
into
you
would
return
via
the
neutral
lead
keeping
the
gfci
happy
the
two
pairs
of
connections
on
a
gfci
outlet
are
not
symmetric
one
is
labeled
load
the
other
line
the
incoming
power
feed
must
be
connected
to
the
line
side
or
the
outlet
will
not
be
protected
the
load
side
can
be
used
to
protect
all
devices
downstream
from
it
thus
a
whole
string
of
outlets
can
be
covered
by
a
single
gfci
outlet
subject
where
should
gfcis
be
used
the
nec
mandates
gfcis
for

single

outlets
in
bathrooms

within
of
the
sink

unfinished
basements
or
crawl
spaces
outdoors
near

are

those
dedicated

typically
refrigerators

the

there

no

where

gfcis
are

dont

b
are
used
to
power
equipment
that
must
run
unattended
for
long
periods
of
time
refrigerators
freezers
and
sump
pumps
are
good
examples
the
rationale
is
that
gfcis
are
sometimes
prone
to
nuisance
trips
some
people
claim
that
the
inductive
delay
in
motor
windings
can
cause
a
momentary
current
imbalance
tripping
the
gfci
note
though
that
most
gfci
trips
are
real
if
youre
getting
a
lot
of
trips
for
no
apparent
reason
youd
be
welladvised
to
check
your
wiring
before
deciding
that
the
gfci
is
broken
or
useless
subject
what
is
the
difference
between
a
gfci
outlet
and
a
gfci
breaker
for
most
situations
you
can
use
either
a
gfci
outlet
as
the
first
device
on
the
circuit
or
you
can
install
a
breaker
with
a
builtin
gfci
the
former
is
generally
preferred
since
gfci
breakers
are
quite
expensive
for
example
an
ordinary
ge
breaker
costs
the
gfci
model
costs
there
is
one
major
exception
if
you
need
to
protect
a
multiwire
branch
circuit
two
or
more
circuits
sharing
a
common
neutral
wire
such
as
a
canadianstyle
kitchen
circuit
youll
need
a
multipole
gfci
breaker
unfortunately
these
are
expensive
the
cost
can
range
into
the
hundreds
of
dollars
depending
on
what
brand
of
panel
box
you
have
but
if
you
must
protect
such
a
circuit
say
for
a
pool
heater
you
have
no
choice
one
more
caveat
gfci
outlets
are
bulky
you
may
want
to
use
an
oversize
box
when
installing
them
on
second
thought
use
large
actually
deep
boxes
everywhere
youll
thank
yourself
for
it
incidentally
if
youre
installing
a
gfci
to
ensure
that
one
specific
outlet
is
protected
such
as
a
bathroom
you
dont
really
have
to
go
to
all
of
the
trouble
to
find
the
first
outlet
in
the
circuit
you
could
simply
find
the
first
outlet
in
the
bathroom
and
not
gfci
anything
upstream
of
it
but
protecting
the
whole
circuit
is
preferred
when
you
install
a
gfci
its
a
good
idea
to
use
the
little
ground
fault
protected
stickers
that
come
with
it
and
mark
the
outlets
downstream
of
the
gfci
you
can
figure
out
which
outlets
are
downstream
simply
by
tripping
the
gfci
with
the
test
button
and
see
which
outlets
are
dead
subject
whats
the
purpose
of
the
ground
prong
on
an
outlet
then
apart
from
their
use
in
electronics
which
we
wont
comment
on
and
for
certain
fluorescent
lights
they
wont
turn
on
without
a
good
ground
connection
theyre
intended
to
guard
against
insulation
failures
within
the
device
generally
the
case
of
the
appliance
is
connected
to
the
ground
lead
if
theres
an
insulation
failure
that
shorts
the
hot
lead
to
the
case
the
ground
lead
conducts
the
electricity
away
safely
and
possibly
trips
the
circuit
breaker
in
the
process
if
the
case
is
not
grounded
and
such
a
short
occurs
the
case
is
live
and
if
you
touch
it
while
youre
grounded
youll
get
zapped
of
course
if
the
circuit
is
gfciprotected
it
will
be
a
very
tiny
zap
which
is
why
you
can
use
gfcis
to
replace
ungrounded
outlets
both
nec
and
cec
there
are
some
appliances
that
should
never
be
grounded
in
particular
that
applies
to
toasters
and
anything
else
with
exposed
conductors
consider
if
you
touch
the
heating
electrode
in
a
toaster
and
youre
not
grounded
nothing
will
happen
if
youre
slightly
grounded
youll
get
a
small
shock
the
resistance
will
be
too
high
but
if
the
case
were
grounded
and
you
were
holding
it
youd
be
the
perfect
path
to
ground
subject
why
is
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
polarization
nowadays
many
twoprong
devices
have
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
this
is
so
that
the
device
could
rely
not
guaranteed
on
one
specific
wire
being
neutral
and
the
other
hot
this
is
particularly
advantageous
in
light
fixtures
where
the
the
shell
should
neutral

or
other
devices
which
want
to
have
an
approximate
ground
reference
ie
some
radios
most
extension
cords
have
wide
prongs
too
this
requires
that
you
wire
your
outlets
and
plugs
the
right
way
around
you
want
the
wide
prong
to
be
neutral
and
the
narrow
one
hot
most
outlets
have
a
darker
metal
for
the
hot
screw
and
lighter
coloured
screw
for
the
neutral

not

the

the
reasoning
is
simple
with

the

itself
provides

us
plastic

dont
use
metal

clamps
the
cec
is
slightly
different
the
cec
never
permits
cable
armor
as
a

conductor
however
you
must
still
provide
ground
continuity
for

the
cec
also
requires
grounding
of
any
metal
cable
clamps
on
plastic
boxes
the
advantage
of
plastic
boxes
is
comparatively
minor
even
for
nonmetallic
sheathed
cable
you
can
avoid
making
one
ground
connection
and
they
sometimes
cost
a
little
less
on
the
other
hand
plastic
boxes
are
more
vulnerable
to

for

metal

are
probably
better
subject

i
install
a
replacement
light
fixture
in
general
one
can
replace
fixtures
freely
subject
to
a
few
caveats
first
of
course
one
should
check
the
amperage
rating
of
the
circuit
if
your
heart
is
set
on
installing
half
a
dozen
watt
floodlights
you
may
need
to
run
a
new
wire
back
to
the
panel
box
but
there
are
some
more
subtle
constraints
as
well
for
example
older
house
wiring
doesnt
have
hightemperature
insulation
the
excess
heat
generated
by
a
ceilingmounted
lamp
can
and
will
cause
the
insulation
to
deteriorate
and
crack
with
obvious
bad
results
some
newer
fixtures
are
specifically
marked
for
high
temperature
wire
only
you
may
find
in
fact
that
your
ceiling
wiring
already
has
this
problem
in
which
case
replacing
any
devices
is
a
real
adventure
other
concerns
include
providing
a
suitable
ground
for
some
fluorescent
fixtures
and
making
sure
that
the
ceiling
box
and
its
mounting
are
strong
enough
to
support
the
weight
of
a
heavy
chandelier
or
ceiling
fan
you
may
need
to
install
a
new
box
specifically
listed
for
this
purpose
a
across
the
ceiling
joists
makes
a
good
support
metal
brackets
are
also
available
that
can
be
fished
into
ceilings
thru
the
junction
box
hole
and
mounted
between
the
joists
there
are
special
rules
for
recessed
light
fixtures
such
as
pot
lamps
or
heat
lamps
when
these
are
installed
in
insulated
ceilings
they
can
present
a
very
substantial
fire
hazard
the
cec
provides
for
the
installation
of
pot
lamps
in
insulated
ceilings
provided
that
the
fixture
is
boxed
in
a
coffin
usually
made
by
making
a
pair
of
joists
high
and
covering
with
plywood
that
doesnt
have
any
insulation
yes
thats
feet
long
nec
rules
are
somewhat
less
stringent
they
require
at
least
clearance
between
the
fixture
and
any
sort
of
thermal
insulation
the
rules
also
say
that
one
should
not
obstruct
free
air
movement
which
means
that
a
cecstyle
coffin
might
be
worthwhile
presumably
thats
up
to
the
local
inspector
the
cec
doesnt
actually
mandate
the
coffin
perse
this
seems
to
be
an
inspector
requirement
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
the
fixture
cant
get
accidentally
buried
in
insulation
ie
if
you
have
insulation
blown
in
later
there
are
now
fixtures
that
contain
integral
thermal
cutouts
and
fairly
large
cases
that
can
be
buried
directly
in
insulation
they
are
usually
limited
to
watt
bulbs
and
are
unfortunately
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
older
types
before
you
use
them
you
should
ensure
that
they
have
explicit
ul
or
csa
approval
for
such
uses
follow
the
installation
instructions
carefully
the
prescribed
location
for
the
sensor
can
vary

not
yet
appear

fixture
that

coffin
appears

only
legal
approach
subject
what
does
it
mean
when
the
lights
brighten
when
a
motor
starts
this
usually
means
that
the
neutral
wire
in
the
panel
is
loose
depending
on
the
load
balance
one
hot
wire
may
end
up
being
more
than

the
other
less
than
with
respect
to
ground
this
is
a
very
hazardous
situation
it
can
destroy
your
electronic
equipment
possibly
start
fires
and
in
some
situations
electrocute
you
ie
some
us
jurisdictions
require
the
stove
frame
connected
to
neutral
if
this
happens
contact
your
electrical
authority
immediately
and
have
them
come
and
check
out
the
problem
note
a
brief
second
brightening
is
sometimes
normal
with
lighting
and
motors
on
the
same
with
neutral
circuit
a
loose
main
panel
neutral
will
usually
show
increased
brightness
far
longer
than
one
second

case
of
doubt
get

subject
what
is
phase
power
should
i
use
it
can
i
get
it
in
my
house
three
phase
power
has
three
hot
wires
degrees
out
of
phase
with
each
other
these
are
usually
used
for
large
motors
because
it
is
more
efficient
provides
a
bit
more
starting
torque
and
because
the
motors
are
simpler
and
hence
cheaper
youre
most
likely
to
encounter
a
phase
circuit
that
shows
volts
between
any
hot
and
ground
and
volts
between
any
two
hots
the
latter
shows
the
difference
between
a
normal
common
neutral
circuit
which
is
volts
between
the
two
hots
there
are
phase
circuits
with
different
voltages
bringing
in
a
phase
feed
to
your
house
is
usually
ridiculously
expensive
or
impossible
if
the
equipment
you
want
to
run
has
a
standard
motor
mount
it
is
much
cheaper
to
buy
a
new
or
motor
for
it
in
some
cases
it
is
possible
to
run
phase
equipment
on
ordinary
power
if
you
have
a
capacitor
start
unit
or
use
a
larger
motor
as
a
autogenerator
these
are
tricky
but
are
a
good
solution
if
the
motor
is
nonstandard
size
or
too
expensive
or
too
big
to
replace
the
taunton
press
book
the
small
shop
has
an
article
on
how
to
do
this
if
you
must
note
that
you
lose
any
possible
electrical
efficiency
by
using
such
a
converter
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
guarantee
that
subject
is
it
better
to
run
motors
at
or
theoretically
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
however
there
is
a
difference
is
the
amount
of
power
lost
in
the
supply
wiring
all
things
being
equal
a
motor
will
lose
times
less
power
in
the
house
wiring
than
a
motor
this
also
means
that
the
startup
surge
loss
will
be
less
and
the
motor
will
get
to
speed
quicker
and
in
some
circumstances
the
smaller
power
loss
will
lead
to
longer
motor
life
this
is
usually
irrelevant
unless
the
supply
wires
are
more
than
feet
long
subject
what
is
this
nonsense
about
on
circuits
it
is
a
universal
physical
law
that
hp
is
equal
to
watts
given
heating
loss
power
factor
and
other
inefficiencies
it
is
usually
best
to
consider
hp
is
going
to
need
watts
a
circuit
can
only
deliver
watts
to
a
motor
so
it
cannot
possibly
be
more
than
approximately
hp
given
rational
efficiency
factors
is
more
like
it
some
equipment
manufacturers
sears
in
particular
most
router
manufacturers
in
general
advertise
a
hp
rating
that
is
far
in
excess
of
what
is
possible
they
are
giving
you
a
stall
horsepower
or
similar
that
means
the
power
is
measured
when
the
motor
is
just
about
to
stop
turning
because
of
the
load
what
they
dont
mention
is
that
if
you
kept
it
in
that
condition
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
hopefully
your
breaker
will
trip
otherwise
the
motor
will
melt
its
drawing
far
more
current
than
it
can
continuously
when
comparing
motors
compare
the
continuous
horsepower
this
should
be
on
the
motor
nameplate
if
you
cant
find
that
figure
check
the
amperage
rating
which
is
always
present
subject
how
do
i
convert
two
prong
receptacles
to
three
prong
older
homes
frequently
have
twoprong
receptacles
instead
of
the
more
modern
three
these
receptacles
have
no
safety
ground
and
the
cabling
usually
has
no
ground
wire
neither
the
nec
or
cec
permits
installing
new
prong
receptacles
anymore
there
are
several
different
approaches
to
solving
this
if
the
wiring
is
done
through
conduit
or
bx
and
the
conduit
is
continuous
back
to
the
panel
you
can
connect
the
third
prong
of
a
new
receptacle
to
the
receptacle
box
nec
mainly
cec
frowns
on
this
practise
if
there
is
a
copper
cold
water
pipe
going
nearby
and
its
continuous
to
the
main
house
ground
point
you
can
run
a
conductor
to
it
from
the
third
prong
run
a
ground
conductor
back
to
the
main
panel
easiest
install
a
gfci
receptacle
the
ground
lug
should
not
be
connected
to
anything
but
the
gfci
protection
itself
will
serve
instead
the
gfci
will
also
protect
downstream
possibly
also
two
prong
outlets
if
you
do
this
to
protect
downstream
outlets
the
grounds
must
not
be
connected
together
since
it
wouldnt
be
connected
to
a
real
ground
a
wiring
fault
could
energize
the
cases
of
prong
devices
connected
to
other
outlets
be
sure
though
that
there
arent
indirect
ground
plug
connections
such
as
via
the
sheath
on
bx
cable
the
cec
permits
you
to
replace
a
two
prong
receptacle
with
a
three
prong
if
you
fill
the
u
ground
with
a
nonconducting
goop
like
caulking
compound
this
is
not
permitted
in
the
nec
subject
are
you
sure
about
gfcis
and
ungrounded
outlets
should
the
test
button
work
were
sure
about
what
the
nec
and
cec
say
remember
though
that
your
local
codes
may
vary
as
for
the
test
button
theres
a
resistor
connecting
the
load
side
of
the
hot
wire
to
the
line
side
of
the
neutral
wire
when
you
press
the
test
button
current
through
this
resistor
shows
up
as
an
imbalance
and
trips
the
gfci
this
is
a
simple
passive
and
reliable
test
and
doesnt
require
a
real
ground
to
work
if
your
gfci
does
not
trip
when
you
press
the
test
button
it
is
very
probably
defective
or
miswired

somethings

the
problem
should
be
corrected
immediately
the
instructions

specify
that

we
do
not

they

this
the

may
be
as
mundane
as
an

sheet
or
with
the
formalities
of

perhaps
the

was
never

only
the
technician
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
agreed
that
the
nec
does
not
require
it
and
promised
to
investigate
subject
how
should
i
wire
my
shop
as
with
any
other
kind
of
wiring
you
need
enough
power
for
all
devices
that
will
be
on
simultaneously
the
code
specifies
that
you
should
stay
under
of
the
nominal
capacity
of
the
circuit
for
typical
home
shop
use
this
means
one
circuit
for
the
major
power
tools
and
possibly
one
for
a
dust
collector
or
shop
vac
use
at
least
gauge
wire
many
power
tools
have
big
motors
with
a
big
startup
surge
if
you
can
use
amp
breakers
nec
though
cec
requires
standard
receptacles
which
means
youd
have
to
replug
all
your
equipment
lights
should
either
be
on
a
circuit
of
their
own
and
not
shared
with
circuits
in
the
rest
of
the
house
or
be
on
at
least
two
separate
circuits
the
idea
is
that
you
want
to
avoid
a
situation
where
a
blade
is
still
spinning
at
several
thousand
rpm
while
youre
groping
in
the
dark
for
the
off
switch
do
install
lots
of
outlets
its
easier
to
install
them
in
the
beginning
when
you
dont
have
to
cut
into
an
existing
cable
its
useful
if
at
least
two
circuits
are
accessible
at
each
point
so
you
can
run
a
shop
vac
or
a
compressor
at
the
same
time
as
the
tool
you
really
want
but
use
metal
boxes
and
plates
and
maybe
even
metalsheathed
cable
you
may
have
objects
flying
around
at
high
speeds
if
something
goes
a
bit
wrong
note
that
some
jurisdictions
have
a
no
horizontal
wiring
rule
in
workshops
or
other
unfinished
areas
that
are
used
for
working
what
this
means
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
run
along
structural
members
ie
stapled
to
studs
other
possible
shop
circuits
include
heater
circuits
circuits
for
some
large
tools
and
air
compressor
circuits
dont
overload
circuits
and
dont
use
extension
cords
if
you
can
help
it
unless
theyre
rated
for
high
currents
a
coiled
extension
cord
is
not
as
safe
as
a
straight
length
of
wire
of
the
same
gauge
also
the
insulation
wont
withstand
as
much
heat
and
heat
dissipation
is
the
critical
issue
if
your
shop
is
located
at
some
remove
from
your
main
panel
you
should
probably
install
a
subpanel
and
derive
your
shop
wiring
from
it
if
you
have
young
children
you
may
want
to
equip
this
panel
with
a
cutoff
switch
and
possibly
a
lock
if
you
want
to
install
individual
switches
to
safe
particular
circuits
make
sure
you
get
ones
rated
high
enough
for
example
ordinary
light
switches
are
not
safely
able
to
handle
the
startup
surge
generated
by
a
table
saw
buy
horsepowerrated
switches
instead
finally
note
that
most
home
shops
are
in
garages
or
unfinished
basements
hence
the
nec
requirements
for
gfcis
apply
and
even
if
you
know
that
youd
never
use
one
of
your
shop
outlets
to
run
a
lawn
mower
the
next
owner
of
your
house
might
have
a
different
idea
note
fine
woodworking
magazine
often
carries
articles
on
shop
wiring
april
is
one
place
to
start
subject
underground
wiring
you
will
need
to
prepare
a
trench
to
specifications
use
special
wire
protect
the
wire
with
conduit
or
special
plastic
tubing
and
possibly
lumber
dont
use
creosoted
lumber
it
rots
thermoplastic
insulation
and
acts
as
a
catalyst
in
the
corrosion
of
lead
the
transition
from
inhouse
to
underground
wire
is
generally
via
conduit
all
outdoor
boxes
must
be
specifically
listed
for
the
purpose
and
contain
the
appropriate
gaskets
fittings
etc
if
the
location
of
the
box
is
subject
to
immersion
in
water
a
more
serious
style
of
waterproof
box
is
needed
and
of
course
dont
forget
the
gfcis
the
required
depths
and
other
details
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
so
we
suggest
you
consult
your
inspector
about
your
specific
situation
a
hint
buy
a
roll
of
bright
yellow
tape
that
says
buried
power
line
and
bury
it
a
few
inches
above
where
the
wire
has
been
placed
subject
aluminum
wiring
during
the
aluminum
instead
of
copper
wiring
became
quite
popular
and
was
extensively
used
since
that
time
aluminum
wiring
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
house
fires
and
most
jurisdictions
no
longer
permit
it
in
new
installations
we
recommend
even
if
youre
allowed
to
that
do
not
use
it
for
new
wiring
but
dont
panic
if
your
house
has
aluminum
wiring
aluminum
wiring
when
properly
installed
can
be
just
as
safe
as
copper
aluminum
wiring
is
however
very
unforgiving
of
improper
installation
we
will
cover
a
bit
of
the
theory
behind
potential
problems
and
what
you
can
do
to
make
your
wiring
safe
the
main
problem
with
aluminum
wiring
is
a
phenomenon
known
as
cold
creep
when
aluminum
wiring
warms
up
it
expands
when
it
cools
down
it
contracts
unlike
copper
when
aluminum
goes
through
a
number
of
warmcool
cycles
it
loses
a
bit
of
tightness
each
time
to
make
the
problem
worse
aluminum
oxidises
or
corrodes
when
in
contact
with
certain
types
of
metal
so
the
resistance
of
the
connection
goes
up
which
causes
it
to
heat
up
and
corrode
oxidize
still
more
eventually
the
wire
may
start
getting
very
hot
melt
the
insulation
or
fixture
its
attached
to
and
possibly
even
cause
a
fire
since
people
usually
encounter
aluminum
wiring
when
they
move
into
a
house
built
during
the
we
will
cover
basic
points
of
safe
aluminum
wiring
we
suggest
that
if
youre
considering
purchasing
a
home
with
aluminum
wiring
or
have
discovered
it
later
that
you
hire
a
licensed
electrician
or
inspector
to
check
over
the
wiring
for
the
following
things
fixtures
eg
outlets
and
switches
directly
attached
to
aluminum
wiring
should
be
rated
for
it
the
device
will
be
stamped
with
alcu
or
coalr
the
latter
supersedes
the
former
but
both
are
safe
these
fixtures
are
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
ordinary
ones
wires
should
be
properly
connected
at
least
way
around
the
screw
in
a
clockwise
direction
connections
should
be
tight
while
repeated
tightening
of
the
screws
can
make
the
problem
worse
during
the
inspection
it
would
pay
off
to
snug
up
each
connection
note
that
aluminum
wiring
is
still
often
used
for
the
main
service
entrance
cable
it
should
be
inspected
pushin
terminals
are
an
extreme
hazard
with
aluminum
wire
any
connections
using
pushin
terminals
should
be
redone
with
the
proper
screw
connections
immediately
there
should
be
no
signs
of
overheating
darkened
connections
melted
insulation
or
baked
fixtures
any
such
damage
should
be
repaired
connections
between
aluminum
and
copper
wire
need
to
be
handled
specially
current
canadian
codes
require
that
the
wire
nut
used
must
be
specially
marked
for
connecting
aluminum
to
copper
the
nec
requires
that
the
wire
be
connected
together
using
special
crimp
devices
with
an
antioxidant
grease
the
tools
and
materials
for
the
latter
are
quite
expensive
not
practical
to
do
it
yourself
unless
you
can
rent
the
tool
any
nonrated
receptacle
can
be
connected
to
aluminum
wiring
by
means
of
a
short
copper
pigtail
see
above
shows
reasonable
workmanship
neat
wiring
properly
stripped
not
nicked
wire
etc
if
when
considering
purchasing
a
home
an
inspection
of
the
wiring
shows
no
problems
or
only
one
or
two
we
believe
that
you
can
consider
the
wiring
safe
if
there
are
signs
of
problems
in
many
places
we
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
if
the
wrong
receptacles
are
used
you
can
replace
them
with
the
proper
type
or
use
pigtails
having
this
professionally
done
can
range
from
to
per
receptacleswitch
you
can
do
this
yourself
too
subject
im

i
do
congratulations
but
its
generally
a
good
idea
to
hire
an
inspector
to
look
through
the
house
for
hidden
gotchas
not
just
for
wiring
but
plumbing
and
structural
as
well
if
an
inspection
of

shows
no

heres
some
hints
on
what
to
look

time
sometimes
reveal
diy
wiring
that
may
have
hidden
violations
switches

seem
to
control
nothing

perhaps
not
properly

a

shuts

a

that
are
separately
controlled
by
other
wall
switches
except
when
its
really
convenient

what
is
this
weird
stuff
old
style
wiring
in
the
years
since
edison
invented
electricity
several
different
wiring
styles
have
come
and
gone
when
you
buy
an
older
home
you
may
encounter
some
of
this
stuff
this
section
describes
the
old
methods
and
some
of
their
idiosyncrasies
the
oldest
wiring
system
youre
likely
to
encounter
is
called
knob
and
tube
kt
it
is
made
up
of
individual
conductors
with
a
cloth
insulation
the
wires
are
run
along
side
structural
members
eg
joists
or
studs
using
ceramic
standoffs
knobs
wire
is
run
through
structural
members
using
ceramic
tubes
connections
were
made
by
twisting
the
wire
together
soldering
and
wrapping
with
tape
since
the
hot
and
neutral
were
run
separately
the
wiring
tends
to
be
rather
confusing
a
neutral
often
runs
down
the
centre
of
each
room
with
taps
off
to
each
fixture
the
hot
wire
tended
to
run
from
one
fixture
to
the
next
in
some
cases
kt
isnt
colourcoded
so
the
neutral
is
often
the
same
colour
as
the
hot
wires
youll
see
kt
in
homes
built
as
late
as
the
comments
on
kt
the
people
installing
kt
were
pretty
paranoid
about
electricity
so
the
workmanship
tends
to
be
pretty
good
the
wire
insulation
and
insulators
tend
to
stand
up
very
well
most
kt
ive
seen
for
example
is
in
quite
good
condition
no
grounding
grounding
is
usually
difficult
to
install
boxes
are
small
receptacle
replacement
particularly
with
gfci
can
be
difficult
no
bushing
on
boxes
either
so
wiring
changes
need
special
attention
to
box
entry
sometimes
the
neutral
isnt
balanced
very
well
between
separately
hot
circuits
so
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
overload
the
neutral
without
exceeding
the
fusing
on
any
circuit
building
code
does
not
permit
insulation
in
walls
that
contain
kt
connection
to
existing
kt
from
new
circuits
can
be
tricky
consult
your
inspector
modern
wiring
practise
requires
considerably
more
outlets
to
be
installed
than
kt
systems
did
since
kt
tends
to
be
in
pretty
decent
condition
it
generally
isnt
necessary
to
replace
it
simply
because
its
kt
what
you
should
watch
out
for
is
renovations
that
have
interfered
with
it
and
be
cautious
about
circuit
loading
in
many
cases
its
perfectly
reasonable
to
leave
existing
kt
alone
and
add
new
fixtures
on
new
circuits
using
modern
techniques
after
kt
they
invented
multiconductor
cable
the
first
type
you
will
see
is
roughly
a
cloth
and
varnish
insulation
it
looks
much
like
the
romex
cable
of
the
last
decade
or
two
this
stuff
was
used
in
the
and
again
no
grounding
conductor
it
was
installed
much
like
modern
wiring
its
major
drawback
is
that
this
type
of
insulation
embrittles
weve
seen
whole
systems
where
the
insulation
would
fracture
and
fall
off
at
a
touch
bx
cable
of
the
same
vintage
has
similar
problems
this
stuff
is
very
fragile
and
becomes
rather
hazardous
if
the
wires
become
bare
this
wiring
should
be
left
untouched
as
much
as
possible
whenever
an
opportunity
arises
replace
it
a
simple
receptacle
or
switch
replacement
can
turn
into
a
several
hour
long
frustrating
fight
with
electrical
tape
or
heatshrink
tubing
after
this
wiring
technique
the
more
modern
romex
was
invented
its
almost
a
asphalt
impregnated
cloth
often
a
bit
sticky
this
stuff
stands
up
reasonably
well
and
doesnt
present
a
hazard
and
is
reasonably
easy
to
work
with
it
does
not
need
to
be
replaced
it
should
be
considered
as
safe
as
the
modern
stuff

book
which

a

of

tracking
down
an
easy
way
to
solve
the
problem
is
to
use
two
opamps
to
form
the
balanced
lowz
output
but
this
solution
does
not
provide
any
galvanic
isolation
between
keyboard

whatever
plugged

if
no
tight
requiremets
are
demanded
and
some
hum
snap
crackle

pop
sounds
formed
by

loops
can
be

the

even

was
thinking
of
buying
adcom
seperates
i
have
heard
from
alot
of
people
though
that
adcom
sounds
great
but
that
the
components
are
made
cheaply
and
therefore
wont
last
very
long
the
time
estimates
ive
heard
are
like
only
or
years
is
this
true
i
own
the
adcom
power
amp
as
far
as
im
concerned
theres
no
amp
which
can
touch
it
at
the
price
range
the
build
quality
is
very
impressive
and
is
far
superior
to
other
amps
in
the
price
range
the
whole
amplifier
is
extremely
solid
with
massive
heat
sinks
and
very
solid
casing
if
you
open
the
amp
up
there
are
only
very
good
quality
components
in
and
the
amp
seems
to
be
designed
extremely
well
perfect
symmetry
for
both
channels
and
two
transformers
one
for
each
channel
the
binding
posts
on
the
back
of
the
amplifier
are
virtually
the
same
as
those
on
the
classe
model
ie
very
good
i
was
also
sceptical
about
the
amps
being
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
components
they
use
and
how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
i
cannot
see
why
people
say
the
amplifier
wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
my
last
point
i
recently
auditioned
the
adcom
preamp
something
like
the
or
something
it
was
two
years
old
and
it
still
sounded
like
new
if
you
build
an
amplifier
decently
like
the
adcoms
they
will
sound
brilliant
and
last
a
long
time
period

thoughts

something
like
this
cost
to
prototype
is
there
a
better
alternative
than
microwaves
of
course
you
could
develope
this
system
but
there
is
already
a
system
called
global
positioning
satellites
it
gives
three
dimensional
coordinates
anywhere
on
earth
many
surveyors
use
this
system
with
a
differential
receivertransmitter
to
get
coordinates
within
centimeters
basic
receivers
with
resolution
of
a
few
meters
on

are

than

can
guinon
thought
it

global

system
there
are
two
precision
levels
one
for
army
applications
killing
has
to
be
very
accurate
today
and
one
for
civil
ones
the
civil
precision
is
about
to
correct
me
if
im
wrong
though
it
may
be
insufficiant
for
mapping
buildings
but
there
is
a
way
with
an
additional
reference
point
eg
one
fixed
gps
system
in
a
house
to
get
the
same
high
precision
as
the
military
version
but
it
gets
pretty
complicated
then
if
you
use
a
microwave
system
actually
this
means
some
type
of
radar
you
need
quite
a
lot
of
number
crunching
to
get
accurate
vectorized
data
out
of
your
original
signals
so
the
gps
system
seems
to
be
the
better
and

your
applicationthere

hooked

jumper
from

prong
grounding
outlets
whats
wrong
with
my
reasoning
here
first
go
to
the
local
hardware
store
and
pick
up
a
copy
of
wiring
simplified
by
hl
richter
now
if
your
house
is
wired
with
metal
conduit
you
dont
need
a
seperate
ground
wire
assuming
the
house
is
wired
correctly
and
the
pipes
are
connected
to
a
cold
water
pipe
in
your
basement
the
outlets
that
have
a
neutral
hooked
to
the
ground
screw
seem
wrong
anyone
else
think
so
back
in
the
i
was
a
service
technician
for
a
cash
register
company
the
cash
registers
used
microprocessor
circuits
and
back
then
they
were
very
susceptible
to
electrostatic
discharge
and
line
noise
the
biggest
problems
came
from
outlets
that
were
not
properly
grounded
in
almost
every
place
we
went
to
do
an
installation
we
found
outlets
with
the
ground
connected
to
the
neutral
for
of
the
things
you
can
plug
into
one
of
these
they
work
fine
for
our
cash
registers
they
were
a
nightmare
line
noise
tended
to
scramble
the
memory
periodically
with
modern
electronics
using
switching
power
supplies
this
should
be
less
of
a
problem
even
the
company
i
used
to
work
for
is
no
longer
recommending
a
dedicated
line
with
a
seperate
ground
for
their
equipment
i
imagine
if
you
check
most
household
wiring
you
will
find
that
the
ground
and
neutral
are
connected
although
not
ideal
it
should
be

what
you

is
to
use
a

outlet
or
breaker
but
the

will
be
cheaper
in
fact
depending
on
where
you
are
putting
your
new
outlets
a
gfci
may
be
required
you
still
need
to
supply
a
proper
ground
for
a
ground
fault
circuit
interrupter
so
rewiring
is
still
a
part
of
this
job
however
the
ground
may
be
connected
to
a
local
earth
ground
rather
than
back
at
the
breaker
box
as
jamie
said
gfci
devices
are
required
by
code
in
a
number
of
places
most
notably
bathrooms
and
outside
the
house
i
do
suggest
the
use
of
gfci
outlets
rather
than
the
breakers
you
will
end
up
with
much
less
headaches
noise
pickup
in
long
cable
runs
is
sometimes
enough
to
cause
frequent
tripping
of
the
breakers
gfci
devices
do
save
lives

you

them
be

of

you

the

john
what
you
describe
is
very
close
to
what
i
built
and
described
in
the
arrl
computer
network
conference
proceedings
i
built
watt
fsk
transceivers
at
mhz
they
are
essentially
double
conversion
transverters
with
digital
mod
and
demod
at
mhz
the
receiver
uses
the
which
is
the
same
fsk
receiver
chip
i
used
previouslyu
in
the
mbps
ghz
data
link
i
first
published
in
ham
radio
and
which
is
now
also
in
the
arrl
handbook
the
which
includes
a
vhf
converter
section
could
also
be
used
at
these
speeds
there
is
a
newer
and
perhaps
slightly
improved
design
of
this
the
if
i
remember
rightly
while
using
this
would
have
let
me
reduce
the
external
if
count
on
receive
it
didnt
really
offer
all
that
much
help
on
transmit
so
i
didnt
bother
with
it
the
radios
i
built
were
first
designed
and
built
for
kbps
in
a
mhz
channel
but
later
reduced
to
half
that
these
kbps
radios
actually
have
done
quite
well
in
acrossthebench
tests
at
kbps
and
speed
is
pretty
much
a
function
of
filter
design
handling
the
data
stream
is
another
matter
entirely
some
of
the
existing
radios
are
currently
deployed
on
hilltops
in
a
beacon
test
mode
while
there
is
not
yet
endend

i
guess
in

my
suggestions
are
that
this
is
a
fairly
costly
approach
if
the

are
intended
for
users
rather
than
backbones
and
you
might
want
to
carefully
consider
your

you
cant
arrange

that
you

i

the
long

getting
a

expensive

i
am
trying
to
choose
between
a

the
flatpack
would
be
hard
to

since
it

i
would

i
was
also
sceptical
about
the

or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the

see
what
components
they
use

how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
good
pointalso
i
wouldnt
be

that
the
components
they
use

are
of
inferior

it
was

robust

are

shouldnt

i

why
people
say
the

wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the

runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an

to
sound
incredibly
good
an

that

has
no
bearing
on
how
its
gonna
sound
the

you
have
probably
is

actually
id
be
wary
of
excessively
hot
amps
cauz
even
though
the
components
inside
may
be
rated
to
run
that
way
excessive
heat
will
dramatically
shorten
the
life
of
any
electronic
component
regardless
of
quality
in
fact
an
amp
that
does
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
because
either
the
engineer
or
manufacturer
of
that

wanted
to
skimp

any

theyll
be

obvious
replace

also
how
would
i
locate

the

then
couldnt
i
hook
up
rca
outputs
to
that

so
then
he
could
just
use
a
little
amplifier
well
one
thing
you
should
do
is
poke
around
the
terminals
of
the
power
amp
chips
use
a
probe
with
a
resistor
like
a
scope
probe
connected
to
the
input
of
a
small
audio
amp
wspeaker
if
you
find
linelevel
input
to
both
chips
one
of
the
chips
is
bad
and
can
probably
replaced
pretty
easily
if
you
want
to
pick
off
a
nearlinelevel
signal
suitable
for
feeding
to
an
outboard
amp
the
outer
legs
of
the
volume
control
pot
will
often
be
good
enough
this
is
before
the
volume
control
and
usually
before
the
tone
and
balance
controls
too
if
you
take
off
from
the
center
and
ground
legs
of
the
volume
pot
this
will
be
after
the
volume
control
but
again
probably
before
the
other
controls
if
the
unit
is

trim

for

you

the

where
to

wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
except
for
their
size
the
cooling
towers
on
nuclear
power
plants
are
vertually
identical
in
construction
and
operation
to
cooling
towers
designed
and
built
in
the
a
hundred
years
ago
for
coal
fired
power
plants
used
for
lighting
and
early
electric
railways
basicly
the
cylindrical
tower
supports
a
rapid
air
draft
when
its
air
is
heated
by
hot
water
andor
steam
circulating
thru
a
network
of
pipes
that
fill
about
the
lower
of
the
tower
to
assist
cooling
and
the
draft
water
misters
are
added
that
spray
cold
water
over
the
hot
pipes
the
cold
water
evaporates
removing
the
heat
faster
than
just
air
flow
from
the
draft
would
and
the
resulting
water
vapor
is
rapidly
carried
away
by
the
draft
this
produces
the
clouds
frequently
seen
rising
out
of
these
towers
that
slight
pinch
maybe
of
the
way
up
the
tower
is
there
because
it
produces
a
very
significant
increase
in
the
strength
and
rate
of
the
air
draft
produced
compared
to
a
straight
cylinder
shape
the
towers
are
used
to
recondense
the
steam
in
the
sealed
steam
system
of
the
power
plant
so
that
it
can
be
recirculated
back
to
the
boiler
and
used
again
the
wider
the
temperature
difference
across
the
turbines
used
in
the
power
plant
the
more
effecient
they
are
and
by
recondensing
the
steam
in
the
cooling
towers
before
sending
it
back
to
the
boilers
you
maintain
a
very
wide
temperature
difference
sometimes
as
high
as
degrees
or
more
from
first
stage
hot
turbine
to
final
stage
cold

re
subliminal
message
flashing
on
tv
hi
i
was
doing
research
on
subliminal
suggestion
for
a
psychology
paper
and
i
read
that
one
researcher
flashed
hidden
messages
on
the
tv
screen
at
of
a
second
is
that
possible
i
thought
the
maximum
rate
the
tv
was
even
capable
of
displaying
images
was
of
a
second
or
of
a
second
for
an
image
composed
of
only
odd
or
even
scan
lines
you
are
correct
the
fastest
complete
image
that
could
be
presented
on
tv
would
be
one
field
which
is
of
a
second
approximately
of
course
the
phrase
tv
screen
is
often
thrown
around
in
reference
to
any
crt
display
so
perhaps
this
researcher
wasnt
using
normal
tv
rates
might
even
be
a
vector
strokewriter
display
in
which
case
the
lower
limit
on
image
time
is
anyones
guess
and
is
probably

re

questions
if
my

depended
on

id
say
that
its
a

that
uses
longpersistance

well
let
you
live
but
just
this
once
theres
more
to
a
real
storage
scope
than
just
a
longpersistence
phosphor
actually
the
phosphor
isnt
usually
anything
special
at
all
what
makes
a
storage
tube
work
is
a
screen
placed
just
behind
the
phosphor
which
becomes
charged
as
the
electron
beam
intially
writes
the
trace
with
the
trace
now
written
to
the
screen
a
separate
lowlevel
flood
electron
gun
keeps
the
image
lit
by
exciting
those
areas
of
phosphor
which
are
next
to
the
written
areas
on
the
storage
screen
there
are
some
problems
with
this
the
resolution
is
limited
compared
to
a
nonstorage
tube
and
the
stored
trace
tends
to
bloom
with
time
of
course
this
is
pretty
much
obsolete
technology
done
in

the
current
digital
scopes
which
use
rasterscan

i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
except
for
their
size
the
cooling
towers
on
nuclear
power
plants
are
vertually
identical
in
construction
and
operation
to
cooling
towers
designed
and
built
in
the
a
hundred
years
ago
for
coal
fired
power
plants
used
for
lighting
and
early
electric
railways
basicly
the
cylindrical
tower
supports
a
rapid
air
draft
when
its
air
is
heated
by
hot
water
andor
steam
circulating
thru
a
network
of
pipes
that
fill
about
the
lower
of
the
tower
to
assist
cooling
and
the
draft
water
misters
are
added
that
spray
cold
water
over
the
hot
pipes
the
cold
water
evaporates
removing
the
heat
faster
than
just
air
flow
from
the
draft
would
and
the
resulting
water
vapor
is
rapidly
carried
away
by
the
draft
this
produces
the
clouds
frequently
seen
rising
out
of
these
towers
that
slight
pinch
maybe
of
the
way
up
the
tower
is
there
because
it
produces
a
very
significant
increase
in
the
strength
and
rate
of
the
air
draft
produced
compared
to
a
straight
cylinder
shape
the
towers
are
used
to
recondense
the
steam
in
the
sealed
steam
system
of
the
power
plant
so
that
it
can
be
recirculated
back
to
the
boiler
and
used
again
the
wider
the
temperature
difference
across
the
turbines
used
in
the
power
plant
the
more
effecient
they
are
and
by
recondensing
the
steam
in
the
cooling
towers
before
sending
it
back
to
the
boilers
you
maintain
a
very
wide
temperature
difference
sometimes
as
high
as
degrees
or
more
from
first
stage
hot
turbine
to
final
stage
cold

grounding
power
wiring
was
re
a
question
about
outlet
wiring
there
has
been
quite
a
bit
of
discussion
about
house
wiring
and
grounding
practices
here
a
few
points
need
to
be
clarified
the
equipment
grounding
conductor
green
green
with
a
yellow
stripe
bare
or
the
metal
sheath
or
pipe
of
some
wiring
methods
is
used
as
a
safety
ground
to
carry
fault
currents
back
to
the
circuit
breaker
panel
and
to
limit
the
voltage
on
the
metal
case
of
utilization
equipment
or
other
metal
objects
it
should
never
except
for
a
few
exceptions
to
be
discussed
later
carry
the
normal
operating
current
of
a
connected
load
some
equipment
has
filters
in
the
power
supply
which
may
cause
some
slight
current
flow
through
the
grounding
conductor
much
communications
or
audio
equipment
is
sensitive
to
noise
or
slight
voltages
on
the
grounding
conductor
and
may
require
special
wiring
of
the
grounding
conductors
to
provide
reliable
operation
orange
outlets
are
often
used
for
this
with
insulated
grounding
conductors
wired
back
to
the
panel
box
and
in
many
cases
back
to
the
service
anyone
installing
such
a
system
should
read
both
the
section
on
grounding
in
the
national
electric
code
and
publications
on
installing
quiet
isolated
ground
systems
the
code
requires
the
insulated
grounding
conductors
green
wires
to
run
with
the
current
carrying
conductors
back
to
the
panel
box
and
if
required
back
all
the
way
to
the
service
entrance
where
it
is
bonded
to
the
service
ground
water
pipe
or
rod
many
of
these
systems
are
installed
illegally
or
unsafely
where
they
do
not
provide
a
safe
ground
or
a
quiet
ground
or
either
the
grounded
conductor
of
a
circuit
often
called
the
neutral
which
is
referred
to
in
the
code
as
the
identified
conductor
and
is
supposed
to
be
white
or
natural
grey
this
conductor
is
supposed
to
be
connected
to
ground
in
most
electrical
systems
at
a
single
point
generally
at
the
service
entrance
panel
this
connection
is
through
the
main
bonding
jumper
in
many
household
service
panels
the
main
bonding
jumper
is
actually
a
bonding
screw
which
attaches
the
neutral
busbar
to
the
case
of
the
panel
the
grounded
conductor
neutral
is
generally
a
current
carrying
conductor
in
the
case
of
a
volt
circuit
it
is
one
of
the
two
conductors
completing
the
circuit
from
the
panel
to
the
load
device
since
the
grounded
conductor
neutral
is
only
connected
to
the
grounding
conductor
bare
or
green
at
the
service
entrance
if
the
load
is
any
distance
from
the
service
and
draws
any
significant
current
there
will
be
a
small
but
measurable
voltage
between
the
grounded
and
grounding
conductors
at
the
load
under
normal
operating
conditions
if
you
should
incorrectly
connect
the
grounded
neutral
conductor
to
the
grounding
conductor
at
the
load
some
of
the
neutral
current
will
flow
instead
through
the
grounding
conductor
since
there
will
now
be
current
flowing
through
the
grounding
conductor
it
will
also
no
longer
be
quite
at
ground
potential
at
the
load
end
if
the
load
equipment
has
a
metal
case
which
is
connected
to
the
grounding
conductor
through
the
u
ground
plug
the
metal
case
is
now
also
no
longer
quite
at
ground
potential
the
difference
under
normal
non
shortcircuit
conditions
may
be
only
a
few
tenths
of
a
volt
but
it
could
also
be
a
volt
or
two
this
normally
does
not
present
a
shock
hazard
however
if
you
let
the
metal
case
of
the
grounded
equipment
come
into
contact
with
an
independently
grounded
object
such
as
a
water
or
gas
pipe
a
radiator
a
metal
air
conditioning
duct
or
such
part
of
the
neutral
current
will
try
to
flow
through
this
aalternate
ground
path
if
the
contact
is
not
solid
you
will
get
a
significant
arc
a
low
voltage
but
possibly
moderate
current
arc
under
the
wrong
conditions
this
arcing
could
start
a
fire
it
is
possible
in
some
cases
that
the
sneak
ground
current
could
also
flow
through
a
wire
of
inadequate
size
causing
it
to
overheat
with
the
incorrect
non
singlepoint
grounding
of
the
neutral
if
there
is
a
short
circuit
from
hot
to
neutral
the
high
short
circuit
current
which
may
flow
will
cause
a
much
higher
voltage
on
the
grounding
conductor
which
increases
the
possibility
for
shock
or
fire
also
if
you
incorrectly
multiply
connect
the
neutral
and
ground
the
voltage
on
the
ground
system
is
seen
as
noise
bu
computer
or
audio
equipment
often
causing
malfunction
i
have
spent
some
hours
tracking
down
such
shorts
in
technical
facilities
where
they
were
inducing
severe
hum
into
equipment
the
neutral
is
usually
bonded
to
the
ground
at
the
distribution
transformer
as
well
as
at
the
service
entrance
of
each
dwelling
this
is
done
primarily
for
lightning
protection
so
that
induced
lightning
currents
have
a
short
path
back
to
ground
and
also
to
assure
that
the
currents
drawn
by
shorts
to
grounded
objects
like
pipes
draw
enough
current
to
trip
circuit
breakers
or
blow
fuses
quickly
the
bad
side
of
this
is
that
not
all
the
neutral
current
from
the
dwelling
goes
through
the
neutral
wire
back
to
the
transformer
some
of
it
flows
through
the
grounding
electrode
water
pipe
etc
this
may
cause
corrosion
in
the
pipes
and
possibly
in
things
like
underground
fuel
oil
tanks
and
it
may
also
cause
measurable
ac
magnetic
fields
due
to
the
large
loop
between
the
hot
conductors
in
the
service
and
the
neutral
current
in
the
water
pipe
and
ground
there
are
those
who
feel
these
fields
may
be
unhealthy
dont
flame
me
on
this
im
just
telling
you
where
the
field
comes
from
not
its
health
effect
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
note
that
the
bonding
jumper
is
only
installed
at
the
main
panel
not
at
any
sub
distribution
panels
this
is
one
reason
why
it
is
illegal
to
run
service
entrance
cable
with
the
sheath
used
as
a
neutral
to
a
sub
panel
you
must
have
a
seperate
insulated
conductor
for
the
neutral
the
sheath
can
be
used
in
this
application
only
as
the
grounding
conductor
if
the
neutral
is
bonded
to
the
grounding
conductor
in
the
sub
panel
say
by
forgetting
to
remove
the
bonding
screw
all
the
grounding
conductors
of
the
loads
on
that
panel
will
be
above
ground
with
the
possible
problems
listed
above
the
code
makes
exceptions
for
ranges
and
dryers
as
well
as
feeds
from
one
building
to
another
in
the
cases
of
the
range
and
dryer
the
neutral
may
be
used
as
the
equipment
ground
under
certain
conditions
instead
of
a
seperate
wire
every
time
the
code
is
revised
these
exceptions
come
up
for
review
these
exceptions
were
in
fact
the
first
required
safety
grounds
in
the
days
before
u
ground
outlets
and
such
the
appliance
manufacturers
dont
want
to
have
to
redesign
their
ranges
and
driers
and
the
contractors
dont
want
to
have
to
run
four
wire
cable
with
four
fairly
heavy
expensive
wires
in
place
of
three
wire
to
the
appliances
no
question
it
would
be
safer
with
seperate
neutrals
to
the
stove
but
the
neutral
current
is
low
for
most
burner
settings
since
most
current
is
in
the
volt
hots
except
at
some
low
settings
the
wires
are
large
gauge
and
there
are
few
reported
cases
of
injury
or
damage
so
far
the
exceptions
have
survived
in
the
case
of
feeds
between
buildings
its
primarily
for
lightning
protection
people
doing
wiring
should
be
aware
what
is
and
what
isnt
a
legal
grounding
conductor
obviously
the
bare
wire
in
romex
with
ground
is
anywhere
there
is
a
green
wire
installed
such
as
in
a
portable
cord
that
is
a
good
grounding
conductor
the
sheath
of
bx
clamped
in
bx
connectors
in
metal
boxes
is
a
legal
grounding
conductor
in
the
us
bx
has
an
aluminum
band
run
under
the
steel
sheath
to
lower
the
resistance
of
the
sheath
you
can
just
cut
this
aluminum
band
off
at
the
ends
you
dont
have
to
bond
it
to
anything
it
does
its
job
by
touching
every
turn
of
the
bx
sheath
conduit
or
emt
thinwall
tubing
is
generally
a
legal
grounding
conductor
but
may
require
a
bonding
locknut
where
it
enters
a
box
or
panel
particularly
for
larger
pipes
greenfield
looks
like
big
bx
but
you
pull
your
own
wires
in
the
empty
sheath
after
you
run
it
is
not
a
legal
grounding
conductor
as
it
doesnt
have
the
aluminum
band
to
bond
it
and
the
spiral
steel
has
too
much
resistance
and
inductance
you
have
to
run
a
seperate
green
grounding
conductor
inside
the
greenfield
wiremold
is
also
not
a
legal
grounding
conductor
as
the
paint
on
the
boxes
often
prevents
good
contact
and
the
feed
to
the
wiremold
extension
is
often
from
a
box
in
the
wall
that
may
not
be
well
connected
to
the
first
wiremold
box
i
have
personally
discovered
cases
where
the
entire
run
of
wiremold
and
the
cases
of
everything
plugged
into
all
the
outlets

why
do
i
get
a
shock
every

i
touch
my

the

here
in

because
there
was
no
ground
wire
in
the

and
one
of
the
outlets
had
shorted
to
the
edge
of
the

you
must
run
a

back
in
the

from
the

at

to
the

you

bond
the

whatever

while
you
should
ground
the

on

outlets
when
ever
there
is
a
place
to
ground
them
it
is
legal
in
the
nec
to
use
them
without
a
ground
if
no
ground
is
available
it
is
better
to
have
the
protection
of
the
ground
fault
interrupter
than
no
protection
if
you
dont
install
it
the
interrupter
doesnt
depend
on
the
ground
to
trip
it
is
desirable
to
connect
the
ground
if
available
because
if
the
ground
is
connected
the
interrupter
will
trip
as
soon
as
a
faulty
device
is
plugged
in
whereas
without
the
ground
it
will
not
trip
until
someone

i

what
the

do
they
cool
great
explaination
however
you
left
off
one
detail
why
do
you
always
see
them
at
nuclear
plants
but
not
always
at
fossil
fuel
plants
at
nuclear
plants
it
is
prefered
to
run
the
water
closed
cycle
whereas
fossil
fuel
plants
can
in
some
cases
get
away
with
dumping
the
hot
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
oil
and
gas
fired
steam
plants
also
have
condensers
but
they
usually
are
sized
to
get
the
steam
back
into
hot
water
not
most
of
the
way
down
to
ambient
some
plants
do
cool
the
condensers
with
water
rather
than
air
as
one
canadian
official
asked
about
thermal
pollution
deicing
a
river
said
up

we
view
heat
as
a

everybody
runs
closedcycle

purified
of

which
otherwise
crud
up
the
boiler

when
the
water
boils
purifying
water
for
boiler
use
is
a
bigger
job
than
cooling
it
so
the

that
does
a

of
making

drawings
the

needs

if
possible
what
i
want
the

to
do
is
to
draw

by
dragging

onto

and
in
this
the
elements
needed
are
as
diverse
as
vacuum
tubes
to
ics
case
with

it
also
needs
to
have
provision
for
adding
legends
to
the
components
as
well
as
their
values
in
other
words
i
want
to
produce

printout
would

if
you

how
hard
would
it
be
to
somehow
interface
them
to
some
of
the
popular
motorola
microcontrollers
i
am
a
novice
at
microcontrollers
but
i
am
starting
to
get
into
them
for
some
of
my
projects
i
have
several
simms
laying
around
from
upgraded
macs
and
if
i
could
use
them
as
free
memory
in
one
or
two
of
my
projects
that
would
be
great
one
project
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
caller
id
device
that
would
require
quite
a
bit
of
ram
to
store
several
hundered
cid
records
etc
assuming
in
expanded
muxed
mode
you
could
do
it
much
easier
if
you
get
a
dram
controller
ic
the
mmi
could
be
used
to
implement
this
or
you
could
use
a
counter
and
a
huge
multiplexer
to
provide
rowcolumnrefresh
address
multiplexing
the
thing
with
drams
is
that
they
require
wierd
timing
address
multiplexing
and
refresh
actually
if
you
wanted
to
use
a
ic
you
could
look
at
which
has
a
neat
controller
built
in
there
is
also
the
i
think
one
of
those
has
the
dram
controller
built
in
this
one
is
for
the
dram
however
the
has
only
one
more
address
line
adding
only
another
component
or
so
the
simms
are
basically
or
dram
chips
or
their
equivalent
in
fewer
packages
it
can
be
done
just
takes
a
bit

im
actually

theres
a

in

that
nuclear

uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear

to
get

as

as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
as
a
point
of
info
some
of
the
early
nuclear

plants
in
this
country
used
the
fission
pile
as
a

stage
to
get

then
had
a

the

it

be
noted
that
the

both
fossile

it
should
also
be
noted
that
at
locations
where
water
is
plentiful
the
cooling

are
only
used
part
time
when
the

temperature
would
exceed
some

limit
it
was
once

you

it

the

they
use

there
are
two
ways
around
this
that
i
know
of
first
of
all
you
can
try
using
a
different
vcr
to
copy
onto
it
is
the
input
of
the
vcr
that
reacts
to
the
protection
so
sometimes
just
switching
the
two
vcrs
around
will
take
care
of
it
some
models
just
dont
react
to
it
does
this
also
affect
the
viewing
of

i
have
had
problems
with
a
couple
of
rented
tapes
they
were
virtually
unviewable
i
fiddled
with
the
tuning
tracking
and
vertical
hold
but
it
was
no
good
it
sounds
like
your
tv
is
one
of
the
ones
that
also
reacts
to
the
video
protection
poor
you
the
macroscrubber
from
radio
electronics
removes
the
protection
so
you
souldnt
have
any
more
problems
however
if
you
use
the
method
of
copying
it
from
one
vcr
to
another
where
the
second
vcr
doesnt
react
to
the
protection
you
will
end
up
with
a
duplicate
tape
including
the
protection
one
thought
comes
to
mind
about
your
problem
when
playing
the
tape
for
viewing
are
you
feeding
the
signal
from
the
source
vcr
through
an
extra
device
before
going
to
the
tv
if
you
feed
it
through
a
second
vcr
first
that
is
your
problem
as
to
other
devices
such
as
converters
i
dont
know
if
they
would
react
or
not
just
to
be
safe
you
might
want
to
make
sure
that
you
have
nothing

john

writes
during
the
nuclear
fission
reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
this
happens
the
liquid
uranium
is
pumped
to
the
cooling
tower
where
it
is
sprayed
into
the
air
contact
with
the
cool
outside
air
will
condense
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cooling
tower
floor
there
it
is
collected
by
a
cleaning
crew
using
shop
vacs
and
is
then
reformed
into
pellets
for
reactor
use
the
next

cooling

are
a

taller

really
need

companies
are

arguing

rather
than

hpvcdjohne
i
think
you
posted
your
article
days
too
late
april
is
over
i
dont
like
nuclear
powerplants
but
i
think
its
not
fair
to
tell
such
storys
about
them
ok
let
me
try
to
explain
what
that
tower
is
used
to
even
the
modernst
nuclear
powerplant
is
only
a
simple
steamengine
it
has
an
hightech
boiler
but
the
rest
is
still
verry
verry
conventional
and
if
youve
already
visited
any
condensation
powerstation
youl
have
seen
the
cooling
towers
too
if
you
look
at
any
good
book
about
thermophysics
youll
find
a
chapter
about
the
carnotprocess
which
describes
how
to
get
energy
from
a
temperature
difference
and
that
is
the
reason
for
cooling
towers
too
you
only
can
get
energy
if
youve
an
temperature
gradient
that
means
that
you
have
steam
on
the
one
side
and
need
to
cool
down
the
steam
till
you
get
water
again
on
the
other
side
if
you
want
to
get
aprox
of
the
energy
you
or
better
the
uranium
brought
into
the
water
to
let
it
boil
if
you
only
have
hot
steam
on
the
one
and
cold
steam
on
the
other
side
youll
loose
much
more
of
the
energy
and
so
they
cool
down
the
steam
to
get
at
least
the
of
energy
that
carnot
will
give
them
the
cooling
towers
are
for
cooling
the
steam
the
vapor
youll
see
is
not
the
steam
of
the
main
core
circulation
because
that
steam
is
radioactive
the
circulation
is
divided
in
at
least
circuits
connected
about
heat
exchangers
to
prevent
radioactive
pollution
of
the
environment
ok
the
main
core
is
hot
but
even
in
the
modernst
hightemperature
reactors
htr
they
only
run
at
deg
celsius
this
is
still
verry
far
away
from
uraniums
melting
point
which
is
somewhere
around
deg
celsius
but
youll
have
lots
of
problems
with
the
boilers
steel
thats
because
at
this
temperature
the
metal
is
attacked
by
steam
and
will
corrode
verry
fast
this
is
only
for
bwrs
the
new
he
cooled
reactors
have
temperatures
up
to
deg
celsius
but
this
is
only
experimental
i
personaly
think
that
nuclear
waste
should
be
as
low
as
ever
possible
because
the
dose
you
get
will
accumulate
about
the
years
today
mrem
and
next
year
mrem
wont
be
mrem
at
all
it
accumulates
and
even
in

youll
still

do
the
object
of

is
to
distribute
dissolved

over
large
areas
of

and
to
therefore
decrease
farm
subsidies

great
explaination
however
you
left
off
one
detail
why
do
you
always
see
them
at
nuclear
plants
but
not
always
at
fossil
fuel
plants
at
nuclear
plants
it
is
prefered
to
run
the
water
closed
cycle
whereas
fossil
fuel
plants
can
in
some
cases
get
away
with
dumping
the
hot
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
the
reasons
you
dont
see
so
many
cooling
towers
at
fossil
plants
are
fossil
units
multiple
units
per
plant
are
generally
smaller
than
nuclear
plants
mwe
seemed
to
be
a
very
popular
size
when
many
fossil
plants
were
built
the
average
nuclear
plant
is
mwe
many
fossil
plants
were
grandfathered
when
water
discharge
regulations
were
adopted
why
those
old
dirt
burners
cant
harm
anything
let
em
go
powered
draft
cooling
towers
low
enough
to
the
ground
to
be
generally
not
visible
from
offsite
are
quite
popular
with
fossil
plants
fossil
plants
used
to
get
much
less
regulatory
attention
than
nuclears
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
oil
and
gas
fired
steam
plants
also
have
condensers
but
they
usually
are
sized
to
get
the
steam
back
into
hot
water
not
most
of
the
way
down
to
ambient
some
plants
do
cool
the
condensers
with
water
rather
than
air
as
one
canadian
official
asked
about
thermal
pollution
deicing
a
river
said
up
here
we
view
heat
as
a
resource
actually
the
condensing
environment
is
essentially
the
same
for
plants
of
similar
size
the
issues
are
the
same
regardless
of
where
the
heat
comes
from
condensers
are
run
at
as
high
a
vacuum
as
possible
in
order
to
reduce
aerodynamic
drag
on
the
turbine
the
condenser
pressure
is
normally
waters
vapor
pressure
at
the
condensing
temperature
it
is
desirable
that
the
steam
exhaust
be
free
of
water
droplets
because
moisture
in
the
steam
causes
severe
erosion
damage
to
the
turbine
low
pressure
blades
and
because
entrained
water
moving
at
high
velocity
causes
erosion
of
the
condenser
tubes
the
coldest
and
thus
lowest
pressure
condensing
environment
is
always
the
best
a
related
issue
is
that
of
pumping
the
condensate
from
the
hotwell
where
the
water
ends
up
after
dripping
off
the
condenser
tubes
since
the
condenser
is
at
a
very
low
pressure
the
only
force
driving
the
condensate
into
the
hotwell
pumps
is
gravity
if
the
condensate
is
too
hot
or
the
gravity
head
is
too
low
the
condensate
will
reflash
into
steam
bubbles
and
cause
the
condensate
pumps
to
cavitate
this
is
a
particularly
destructive
form
of
cavitation
that
is
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
the
hotwell
pumps
are
located
in
the
lowest
point
in
the
plant
in
order
to
provide
a
gravity
head
to
the
pumps
how
much
lower
they
must
be
is
a
function
of
how
hot
the
water
is
allowed
to
get
in
the
hotwell
typically
hotwell
temperatures
run
between
and
degrees
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
river
water
this
term
is
used
to
describe
the
river
grade
water
even
when
the
cooling
tower
system
is
operating
in
closed
loop
mode
and
essentially
no
river
water
is
pumped
when
the
river
water
temperature
is
high
in
the
summer
operators
will
typically
allow
the
hotwell
level
to
rise
in
order
to
provide
more
gravity
head
there
is
a
tradeoff
involved
since
higher
hotwell
levels
will
encroach
onto
the
condensing
tubes
and
reduce
the
condenser
area
at
least
in
the
east
and
elsewhere
where
moisture
actually
exists
in
the
air
the
river
water
will
almost
always
be
cooler
than
the
discharge
water
from
the
cooling
towers
the
temperature
of
the
discharge
water
from
the
cooling
towers
is
set
by
the
ambient
air
temperature
and
humidity
it
is
very
rare
in
the
east
to
hear
of
actual
river
water
temperatures
exceeding
degrees
a
vast
difference
from
the
typical
days
degrees
humidity
we
see
routinely
in
the
east
it
is
not
unusual
particularly
where
the
econazis
have
been
successful
in
clamping
rigid
discharge
water
temperature
limits
on
a
plant
for
the
plant
to
have
to
reduce
the
firing
rate
when
the
air
temperature
gets
too
high
and
the
condenser
cannot
handle
the
heat
load
without
excessive
pressure

an

though
that
isnt

it
may
not
be
in

the
most

probably
vary
with
local

and
i
think
the

vary
rather

from

you
can

oh
yeah
and
sometimes

do

not

often
enough
that
i

at

joel

we
used
to
buy
beckman
and
ruggedized
versions
for

by
electricians
in
the
steel
mill
where
i
work
after
a
while
we
got
round
to
filling
all
the
currentinput

with

electricians
have
a
regrettable
habit
of
not
checking
where
the
last
guy
left
the
leads
before
using
a
digit
autoranging
meter
to
check
if
a

is
good
or
not
its
very
hard
on

and
electricians
when
you
put
the

across

but
thats
not
why
we
stopped
buying
beckmans
after
a
while
a
lot
of
them
got
funny
in
the

display
a
black
stain
would
spread
from
one
edge
or
else
theyd
come
adrift
from
those
zebra
connectors
and
fail
to
operate
now
we
buy
flukes
the
lowend
series
mostly
and
we
still
fill
the
amp
jack
with
silicone
what
the
world
needs
is
a
meter
that
wont
let
you
change
ranges
or
turn
it
onoff
with
a
lead
stuck
in
the
amps
jack
a
little
bit

clever

detailing
would
take
care
of
this
and
make
the

safer

anyway
not

ive
ever

thought
the

you

the

perhaps
this

heres
a
rough
sketch
of
how
the
system
works
a
reference
station
with
a
very
exactly
known
position
computes
the
errors
in
the
incoming
gps
signals
these
errors
are
due
to
several
factors
including
atmospheric
distortion
sa
selective
availability
time
dithering
etc
the
reference
unit
contains
complex
computational
equipment
to
back
out
the
errors
in
its
position
since
it
knows
where
it
is
already
it
then
transmits
these
corrections
on
a
broadcast
which
is
available
to
any
number
of
relatively
local
receivers
if
the
receivers
are
nearby
and
are
using
the
same
satellites
as
the
reference
unit
the
errors
should
be
very
similar
for
the
reference
unit
and
the
receiver
unit
thus
the
receiver
unit
may
apply
the
corrections
calculated
by
the
reference
unit
the
us
coast
guard
is
currently
as
far
as
i
know
installing
a
series
of
coastline
transmitters
for
differential
gps
these
stations
will
use
existing
radio
towers
i
believe
the
frequency
is
to
be
approximately
khz
there
are
many
other
private
corporations
offering
dgps
signals
on
different
frequencies
for
example
pinpoint
offers
correction
signals
and
receiver
units
using
an
fm
broadcast
system
which
has
stations
all
across
the
us
the
correction
codes
are
usually
transmitted
using
the
rtcm
format
advertised
accuracies
espouse

very

to
be
specific
have
also

backed

exhibit

this
sounds
like
your
problem
since
flourescent

several
of
feet
away
seem
to
me
to
be

far
to

commonmode

i
have
never

have
a
few
questions
about
low
level
noise
i
have
noticed
that
the
waveform
synthesizer
that
i
am
using
analogic
has
some
relatively
large
common
mode
noise
on
it
i
am
using
this

null
out
another
transient
waveform
and
am
amplifying
the
difference
several
hundred
times
the
has
about
mvpp
of
common
mode
noise
and
this
tends
to
make
my
measurements
hard
to
repeat
the
noise
is
not
quite
in
sync
with
line
frequency
and
on
a
spectrum
analyzer
the
main
component
is
about
how
can
i
get
rid

the
noise
when
i
look

the

using

the

minute
i
switch

isolation

i
am
guessing
the

has
a
diff

on
the
input
since
it
will
read
accurately
down
to
dc
also
if

stick

hi
being
a
electronic
engineering
student
with
only
electronic
ii
under
my
belt
i
find
myself
needing
to
build
a
moderate
wattage
audio
amp
so
ill
throw
out
a
couple
of
question
for
the
vast
knowledge
of
the
net
please
explain
how
watts
are
calculated
in
audio
amp
circuits
no
not
pie
just
how
it
relates
to
one
of
the
following
ai
current
gain
av
voltage
gain
ap
power
gain
or
whatever
i
already
have
a
wonderful
cheap
ie
schematic
for
a
amp
but
i
would
like
to
crossimprove
the
circuit
the
problem
is
that
the
parts
list
has
and
as
amplifiers
they
look
like
pin
sip
packages
with
a
heatsink
this
schematic
was
published
in
a
mag
so
it
may
be
nonexistant
now
anyway
i
tried
looking
up
a
replacement
in
the
latest
digikey
cat
and
found
it
not
listed
the
closes
i
could
figure
was
a
pin
sip
as
anyone
got
any
ideas
i
thought
hey
i
can
rin
a
pspice
simulation
using
opamp
models
yea
great
it
worked
but
i
guess
the
wasnt
made
for
high
power
amps
as
a
result
i
got
a
voltage
gain
of
worse
than
i
started
with
does
anyone
have
a
pspice
ckt
file
with
cheap
yet
good

anyway
over
the
weekend
i
was
resting
on
the
sofa
in
between
chores
and
noticed
that
i
briefly
picked
up
what
sounded
like
ham
radio
traffic
over
my
stereo
and
television
even
though
both
were
off
also
all
the
touch
sensitive
lights
in
my
house
start
going
wacko
cycling
through
their
four
brightness
states
i
presume
that
some
ham
operator
with
an
illegal
amplifier
drove
past
my
house
i
live
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
would
this
be
a
correct
presumption
what
kind
of
power
must
he
be
putting
out
to
cause
the
effects
the
affected
equipment
is
about
feet
from
the
road
hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
for
cars
put
out
around
watts
it
is
possible
that
a
watt
radio
would
cause
interference
to
consumer
electronic
feet
away
most
tvs
stereos
and
vcrs
have
very
poor
rf
shielding
if
you
experience
the
problem
frequently
it
may
be
caused
by
a
ham
cber
or
other
radio
operator
in
a
base
station
nearby
the
interference
may
have
been
caused
by
a
radio
transmitter
used
for
other
purposes
such
as
police
fire
etc
if
you
heard
voices
over
your
stereo
i
think
you
are
correct
in
assuming
that
the
source
is
an
rf
transmitter
if
you
have
frequent
trouble
you
may
want
to
try
the
rf
ferrite
chokes
available
at
radio
shack
the
interference
is
probably
being
picked
up
by
your
speaker
wires
and
those
chokes
can
be
installed
on
the
wires
very
easily
without
cutting
them
good
instructions
are
included
with
the
chokes
if
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
you
may

a

add

use
cue
tapes
to
bring
the

up
our

consoles
date
from
the

and
dont

we
already
have

and
our

system
will
raise
the
houselights
when
its

control
circuit
vac
is
momentarily
closed
for
at

second
ive
tried
wiring
the
dimmer
control
to
a
relay
activated
when
the
cue
tape
completes
the
circuit
low
tech
and
simple
but
theres
one
problem
in
order
to
get
the
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
a
shload
of
cuetape
on
the
film
runs
at
feet
per
minute
so
to
get
a
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
at
least
inches
of
solid
cuetape
ideally
i
would
like
to
use
a
single
crosscue
to
accomplish
this
function
a
single
strip
of
cuetape
perpendicular
to
the
length
of
the
film
this
would
give
a
pulse
of
approximately
of
a
second
what
i
need
is
a
circuit
to
detect
the
short
cue
and
activate
the
relay
for
around
second
the
ability
to
adjust
how
long
the
relay
is
activated
would
be
nice
i
figure
this
would
require
an
rc
circuit
of
some

explain
this
michael

the
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
is
that
two
capacitors
in
series
can
handle
twice
the
output
voltage
sometimes
two
elcos
in
antiseries
you
know
positive
sides
facing
eachother
are
used
to
obtain
a
large
capacitor
that
can
handle
positive
and
negative
voltages
as
well
so
there
probably
is
no
designphilosophical

you
increase

by

they

do
not

need
help
with
video
detection
circuit
i
am
trying
to
build
a
circuit
that
detects
the
presence
of
video
vs
a
blank
screen
by
monitoring
the
rg
and
b
outputs
of
a
graphics
card
it
should
be
able
to
detect
the
presence
of
a
single
pixel
at
mhz
which
would
mean
detecting
a
ns
pulse
it
should
also
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
blank
screen
about
mv
and
a
dim
screen
say
around
mv
oh
yes
it
also
needs
to
be
cheap
my
first
circuit
was
a
dismal
failure
i
used
compariators
each
compariator
had
the
input
going
to
one
of
the
guns
the
input
went
to
a
reference
created
by
a
voltage
dividera
potentiometer
the
first
problem
was
that
the
compariator
was
way
too
slow
i
needed
to
get
several
pixels
in
a
row
before
it
would
fire
the
compariators
so
i
could
have
a
whole
screen
full
of
text
but
my
circuit
would
not
detect
it
the
second
problem
is
that
there
was
more
noise
on
the
reference
then
the
smallest
difference
between
a
blank
screen
and
a
dim
screen
in
fact
the
difference
between
completely
black
and
completely
white
is
only
mv
i
am
wondering
if
i
am
going
to
have
to
amplify
the
video
signals
to
make
this
work
there
are
faster
compariators
but
they
are
expensive
and
require
split
supplies
i
would
need
to
replace
my
quad
compariator
with
three
compariators
and
create
a
whole
new
power
supply
circuit
at
this
point
i
think
what
i
need
is
some
sort
of
transistor
circuit
transistors
are
fast
and
cheap
and
should
do
the
trick
unfortunately
i
am
way
out
of
my
league
when
it
comes
to
designing
transistor
circuits
so
i
am
appealing
to
the
net
for
help
any
ideas
tips
circuits
pointers
references
etc
would
be
greatly
appreciated
oh
yes
i
only
sample
the
output
of
this
thing
every
second
or
so
so
i
dont
need
a
fast
response
time
at
all
however
i
havent
found
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
that
fact

anyway
over
the
weekend
i
was
resting
on
the
sofa
in
between
chores
and
noticed
that
i
briefly
picked
up
what
sounded
like
ham
radio
traffic
over
my
stereo
and
television
even
though
both
were
off
also
all
the
touch
sensitive
lights
in
my
house
start
going
wacko
cycling
through
their
four
brightness
states
i
presume
that
some
ham
operator
with
an
illegal
amplifier
drove
past
my
house
i
live
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
would
this
be
a
correct
presumption
what
kind
of
power
must
he
be
putting
out
to
cause
the
effects
the
affected
equipment
is
about
feet
from
the
road
hams
are
unlikely
to
have
an
illegal
amp
and
are
also
unlikely
to
have
a
dirty
amp
hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
i
can
just
see
it
you
need
to
slow
down
on
a
downgrade
so
you
hit
the
push
to
talk
button
for
cars
put
out
around
watts
it
is
possible
that
a
watt
radio
would
cause
interference
to
consumer
electronic
feet
away
most
tvs
stereos
and
vcrs
have
very
poor
rf
shielding
if
you
experience
the
problem
frequently
it
may
be
caused
by
a
ham
cber
or
other
radio
operator
in
a
base
station
nearby
the
interference
may
have
been
caused
by
a
radio
transmitter
used
for
other
purposes
such
as
police
fire
etc
if
you
heard
voices
over
your
stereo
i
think
you
are
correct
in
assuming
that
the
source
is
an
rf
transmitter
if
you
have
frequent
trouble
you
may
want
to
try
the
rf
ferrite
chokes
available
at
radio
shack
the
interference
is
probably
being
picked
up
by
your
speaker
wires
and
those
chokes
can
be
installed
on
the
wires
very
easily
without
cutting
them
good
instructions
are
included
with
the
chokes
if
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
you
may
want
to
search
your
neighborhood
for
a
radio
operator
look
for
antennas
on
the
roof
or
car
talk
to
himher
about
your
problem
there
are
things
a
radio
operator
can
do
to
reduce
interference
and
please
remember
to
be
friendly
when
approaching
your
local
radio
operator
this
person
may
or
may
not
be
the
cause
of
your
troubles
and
youll
get
better
cooperation
and
help
if
you
assume
that
he
is
going
to
be
helpful
most
are
it
was
amazing
the

that
we
sometimes

pictures
on

you
name
it
btw
the
local

should
try

you
whether
or
not
he
or
she
is
directly
responsible
it
is
part
of
being
a
good

and
that
is
how
the
fcc
views
it

bad
they
dont

tell

are
required
to

a
method
which
will
directly
almost
provide
you
with
the
information
that
you

is
that
which
is
commonly
used
for
coordinate
measurements
of
human

eg
the
selspot

by
selspot
ab

and
the

these
use
lateral

marsolais
to
determine
the
position
of
a
spot
of
light
projected
using
a
camera
lens
over
its
surface
in
escence
the
detector
is
a
large
photodiode
with
four
cathodes
one
on
each
of
the
four
sides
of
the
square
detector
crystal
and
a
single

the
back
of
the

a
spot
of

will
produce
currents
which
are
proportional
to
the
position
of

try

if

then
the
position
of
the

is
given
by
this

regardless
of
the
level
of

the

is
used
to
normalize
relative
to
total
received
power
when
this
circuit
is
used
in
the
presence
of
other
sources

then
the
way
of
tuning
to
it
is
to
sample
for

the

the

digital
voltmeter
how
does
it
work
hello
let
me
introduce
a
problem
when
i
measure
a
sinusoidal
wave
voltage
with
a
digital
voltmeter
using
ac
mode
my
output
is
an
rms
value
a
peak
value
over
squared
right
when
i
measure
a
square
wave
in
the
same
mode
ac
my
output
is
equal
to
a
peak
value
actually
to
the
upper
flat
boundary
of
the
wave
i
assumed
that
a
digital
voltmeter
makes
some
kind
of
integration
of
the
input
value
and
divides
it
over
the
wave
period
right
now
i
used
it
to
measure
the
same
square
wave
as
above
but
distorted
by
highfrequency
harmonics
ideally
output
should
be
the
same
but
the
output
value
was
only
about
of
the
previous
one
why
what
is
the
nature
of
this
output
value
what
does
the
voltmeter
actually
measure
and
what
does
it
show

important

me

are
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
digital

to
compare
with

i
dont
want
to
get

a
semantic
argument
but
contrary
to
some
other
postings
near
uv
light
is
actual
uv
light
the
near
means
that
it
is
close
to
the
visible
spectrum
ie
of
relatively
long
wavelength
not
that
it
is
nearly
uv
im
sure
you
can
figure
out
now
just
what
far
uv
is
regular
incandenscent
flashlight
bulbs
emit
tiny
amounts
of
uv
in
the
near
end
of
the
spectrum
such
that
a
filter
can
be
used
to
remove
the
visible
light
and
thus
create
a
weak
uv
source
stronger
sources
are
going
to
require
gas
probably
mercury
vapor
discharge
tubes
such
as
fluorescent
tubes
with
uv
phosphor
be
careful
though
strong
uv
sources
can
cause
physiological
damage
especially
to
the
eyes
the
shorter
wavelengths
are
the
most
dangerous
it
wouldnt
project
a
beam
like
a
flashlight
but
replacing
the
tubes
in
a
portable
fluorescent
lantern
with
uv
tubes
would
be
a
relatively
cheap
way
to
create
a
portable
source
it
would
be
bright
enough
to
be
useful
but
not
dangerously

a
of
decoder
need
not
be
the
same
as
a
to
demultiplexer
although
many
commercial
ssi
implementations
allow
you
to
use
one
as
such
strictly
a
of
decoder
need
only
take
two
lines
in
and
make
one
output
change
state
according
to
the
inputs
a
demux
on
the
other
hand
uses
two
control
inputs
to
determine
which
of
four
outputs
will
reflect
the
state
of
the
input
signal
so
there
are
three
inputs
required
a
decoder
can
be
used
as
a
demux
if
it
is
equipped
with
an
output
enable
input
since
this
can
be
used
as
the
data
input
eg
when
high
all
outputs
are
high
when
low
only
the
selected
by
control
inputs
output
will
be
low
an
eight
way
decoder
is
created
by
using
the
high
order
bit
bit
to
select
which
of
two
four
way
demuxes
is
enabled
thus
you
achieve
your
aim
of
having
only
one
output
of
eight
reflecting
the
input
bits
note
that
this
method
cannot
be
used
to
create
a
true
eight
way
demux
since
you
have
no
data
input
the
enable
line
on
a
four
way
decoder
left
once
you
commit
the
enable
lines
to
their
intended
purpose
a
sixteen
way
decoder
obviously
requires
four
fourway
decoders
plus
a
mechanism
to
enable
only
one
of
the
four
at
a
time
therefore
use
the
fifth
decoder
attached
to
the
two
high
order
bits
to
provide
the
four
enable
lines
of
course
the
two
low
order
bits
must
be
connected
in
parallel
to
the
four
final
stage
decoders

which

yes
but
the
minimization
of

is
important
in
part
because
of
timing
considerations
a
ttl
gate
has
the
basic
structure
of
andorinvert
and
an
inversion
of
a
sum
of
a
product
is
just
exactly
one

the
reason
to
find
a
minimal

is
that
this
matches
a
hardware
optimization
a
positiveor
gate
such
as
the

uses
has
two
gate
delays
and
theres
another
gate

in
the
second

so
that
the
second

while
simpler
in

symbols
can
be
expected
to
be
something
less
than
optimal
in
the
real
world
ecl
is
similar
to
ttl
in
that
it
can
support
an

the

get
both

basically
large

with
your
choice
of
internal
connections
between
the

and
perhaps
some
latches
so
a
minimum
sum
of
products
also
is
a
way
to
shoehorn
a
logic
design
into
a
few
pals
its
not
comparably
easy
to
design
with
a
minimization
of
logic
gates
but
some

claim

allow

hello

when

my
output
is
an
rms
value
a
peak
value
over

right
when
i
measure
a
square

in
the

ac
my
output
is
equal
to
a
peak
value
actually
to
the
upper
flat
boundary
of
the

i
assumed
that
a
digital
voltmeter
makes
some
kind
of
integration
of
the
input
value
and
divides
it
over
the
wave
period
right
now
i
used
it
to
measure
the
same
square
wave
as
above
but
distorted
by
highfrequency
harmonics
ideally
output
should
be
the
same
but
the
output
value
was
only
about
of
the
previous
one
why
what
is
the
nature
of
this
output
value
what
does
the
voltmeter
actually
measure
and
what
does
it
show
re
rms
readings
unless
the
dvm
says
its
measuring
rms
its
probably
average
voltage
the
input
is
diode
rectified
and
measured
as
dc
if
it
says
its
rms
and
but
measures
squaretriangleetc
incorrectly
its
measuring
average
and
multipling
by
a
correction
thats
only
true
for
sine

ie
vrms
if
you
want
correct
rms
for

waveform
you

what

i
have
a

demodulate
an

by
feeding

the

negative

this
may
sound
like
a
simpleminded
question
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
a
need
for
this
ive
been
designing
some
relatively
simple
chip
circuits
based
on
things
like
photoresistors
you
know
no
light

photoresistor
emit
a

etc
anyway
ive
got
some
servos
lying
around
and
i
wanted
to
do
some
things
with
them
using
digital
logic
i
know
all
about
having
to
pulse
the
signal
and
everything
i
just
have
one
problem
im
assuming
i
need
a
negative
yes
negative
logic
high
to
get
the
thing
to
turn
in
the
direction
opposite
the
direction
it
would
turn
under
normal
logic
high
is
a
negative
logic
high
ive
seen
this
in
schematics
the
same
thing
as
an
active
low
or
what
im
not
using

power
source
so
how
would
i
get

out
of

i
need

the

also
consider

consider

at
youre
lucky
if
only
of

the
best
approach
is
to
estimate
your
loss
and
accomodate
that
into
your
price
structure
sure
it
hurts
legitimate

but
too
bad
retailers
have

charge
off

the

is

so
that
there
will
be
no

on

with

you

always

some

the

to
gently
mute
the

switch
then
remove
the
power
from
the
lamp
in
the
optoisolator
it
used
to
be
standard
practice
to
employ
photoresistors
in
switching
audio
because
the
photoresistor
time
delay
a
few
thousandths
of
a
second
kept
any
noise
in
the
digital
side
which
drives
the

well
my

was

just

the

the

all

ground
wires
are
on
a

except
for

only
black

it
was

in

i
had
also
are
you
sure
this

i
still
have
the

the
point
is
that
the

connecting

neutral
in
the
outlet
box
big
no
no
and
you
are
talking
about
them
being
connected
in
the
breaker
box
as
things
should
be
if
this

not

the
point
is
that
there
should
be
current
flow
in
the
white
ie
neutralreturn
wires
when
things
in
the
house
are
operating
there
should
not
be
any
flow
in
the

wires
unless
there
is
a

notice
also
that
in

is

hello
i
just
bought
a
new
portable
cd
player
for
the
office
and
i
notice
that
it
proudly
proclaims
times
oversampling
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
if
i
really
wanted
better
fidelity
wouldnt
i
have
to
have
the
same
higher
rate
of
sampling
during
the
recording
process
furthermore
am
i
wrong
in
interpreting
the
sampling
rate
from
the
players
point
of
view
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
data
rate
for
the
bit
stream
coming
off
the
optical
medium
does
this
mean
that
the
data
rate
related
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
disk
has
changed
since
note
i
just
tried
to
figure
this
stuff
out
about
a
month
ago
myself
from
various
people
on
the
net
so
i
could
be
wrong
the
data
is
only
ever
read
once
barring
mistracks
and
such
of
course
and
eventually
gets
turned
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete
data
points
and
interpolates
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering

only

smudge

you
would

the

bubblejets

nice

live

word
has
it
that
something
similar
is
on
its
way
here
since
we
apparently
dont
have
the
sensor
base
you
folks
have
theyre
installing
cameras
at
strategic
points
along
the
freeways
initial
tests
are
going
to
be
in
the
santa
clara
area
im
told
with
the
video
being
piped
into
a
command
center
theyre
building
somewhere
in
the
east
bay
im
not
sure
if
frame
grabbers
or
cheap
labor
will
be
used
to
interpret
the
data
but
large
multicolored
status
displays
will
show
the
various
routes
using
different
colors
to
represent
the
various
average
speeds
for
each
stretch
of
highway
an
announcer
will
sit
in
front
of
the
status
wall
and
will
relay
continuous
verbal
traffic
status
to
those
who
want
to
receive
it
theyre
apparently
also
looking
into
licensing
a
lowam
frequency
to
be
dedicated
to
providing
continuous
audio
from
this
system
in
the
mean
time
theyll
set
up
large
incandescent
display
boards
along
the
test
stretch
to
provide
commuters
with
data
on
traffic
conditions
up
ahead
my
understanding
is
that
the
system
is
subsidized
as
a
pilot
program
and
information
from
it
will
be
available
free
of
charge
perhaps
the
la
system
is
similarly
free
or
provided
at
an
obviously
subsidized
rate
read
cheap
we
also
have
the
traffic
reports
that
are
broadcast
on
the
sap
audio
channel
of
television
channels
and
these
are
verbal
reports
qualified
with
a
identification
tone
to
tell
invehicle
receivers
like
the
auto
talk
that
the
information
coming
next
is
applicable
to
a
given
area
in
la
theyre
probably
using
some
other
tv
channels
but
the
concept
is
the
same
try
setting
your
stereo
tv
or
vcr
to
receive
the
sap
audio
channel
and
go
station
jumping
to
find
out
which
one
is
broadcasting
this
information
i
believe
this
program
is
also
subsidized
making
the
invehicle
receivers
cheap
to
purchase
and
without
having
to
incur
monthly
fees
to
use
it
since
the
makers
of
these
invehicle
receivers
dont
have
to
pay
for
the
broadcast
this
may
not
be
completely
true
they
likely
have
no
investment
in
keeping
the
system
up
and
running
when
the
cal
trans
stuff
hits
the
airwaves
you
may
have
a
nifty
little
tv
audio
receiver
in
your
car
nothing
more
when
this
happens
perhaps
a
word
to
the
wise
i
think
wed
all
be
interested
in
a
summary
post
if
you
get
more
info
on
how
the

is

voltage
regulation
and
current
limiting
one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guys
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
supply
to
the
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
from
current
limited
at
voltage
must
stay
within
of
designated
value
for
i
from
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could
work
from

line
bounce
they
do
help

as
i
had
with
the
high
load
on
the

lines
the
transients
you
are

are
really
high
frequency
so
forget
about
large

is
to

allowing

i

exactly
how
wide
the
poly

were
if
i
were
doing

again
id
probably
omit
the
diff
altogether
and
use
a
solid
poly
sheet
instead
using
just
and
poly
and

but
that
has
such
a
high

it
can

but
you
said
something
that

it
sound
like
you
didnt
realize
something
on
a
typical
ups
well
on
ours
anyway
there
is
no
switchover
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protected
equipment
is
always
running
from
the
batteries
via
an
inverter
with
the
usual
condition
of
also
having
them
on
charge
if
the
power
fails
big
deal
the
computers
never
see
it
until
the
batteries
start
to
droop
but
theres
something
like
carsized
batteries
in
that
cabinet
so
it
takes
a
while
if
you
were
gonna
run
the
guts
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
inverter
why
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
thered
be
no
switchover
to
screw
things
up
and
no
having
to
sense
the
failure
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charge
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need
it
actually
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
thati
sounds
to
me
your
ups
takes
in
ac
rectifies
it
to
dc
to
charge
the
batteries
and
then
takes
the
battery
dc
and
chops
it
to
ac
again
feeding
your
equipment
this
approach
is
the
easiest
and
cleanest
way
to
switchover
from
the
mains
to
battery
once
your
power
kicks
out
since
as
you
mentioned
nothing
will
know
about
what
happened
down
the
line
another
way
to
do
the
ups
scheme
is
to
use
the
mains
until
you
lose
power
and
then
kick
in
the
battery
backup
with
its
inverter
to
replace
the
lost
power
the
problem
here
is
the
switchover
time
and
youve
got
to
resync
the
ac
in
no
time
flat
thats
a
standby
unit
not
a
ups
otherwise
there
would
be
no
interuption
many
standby

are

as
upss
though
morgan
bullard
or
mjbbuxacsouiucedu
unfortunately
most
everything
is
built
around
the
assumption
that
ac
is
available
so
the
ups
guys
have
to
provide
and
ac
output
to
be
usableya
sorta
have
to
make

then
if

they
glow

could
someone
please
inform

can

so
where

how

also
are

times

the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
the
data
is
only
ever
read
once
barring
mistracks
and
such
of
course
and
eventually
gets
turned
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete
data
points
and
interpolates
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
understanding
the
filtering
is
not
interpolation
as
that
would
distort
the
frequency
content
of
the
signal
you
are
listening
to
generally
these
players
run
the
samples
thru
an
allpass
filter
network
i
have
done
this
for
ecg
waveforms
from
a
persons
heart
and
the
effect
is
rather
spooky
it
actually
reconstructs
peaks
that
werent
there
correctly
too
and
fills
in
the
gaps
with
the
properly
computed
values
just
as
if
there
had
been
a
real
sample
taken
at
that
point
i
use
a
cpu
to
do
all
the
math
it
takes
a
decent
but
not
unreasonable
amount
of
cpu
time
to
do
this
you
can
keep
up
with
things
in
realtime
if
you
write
efficient
code
in
case
you
care
the
filtering
method
uses
an
fir
finite
impulse
response
filter
id
guess
that
cd
makers
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybody
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tapped
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weighting
to
accomplish
the
filtering
this
strikes
me
as
the
most
cost
effective
method
for
volume
production
runs
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering
actually
i
think
the
only
reason
they
do
this
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
marketting
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acutally
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampled
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
components
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
its
too
bad
that
they
charge
more
for
something
that
i
think
is
actually
less
costly
to
build
i
seriously
doubt
that
the
filters
cost
the
same
but
are
better
they
are
built
to
a
price
spec
and
that
spec
says
cheap
as

tony
pink
noise
is
a
random
signal
with
more
lowfrequency
components
than
white
noise
if
you
look
at
the
frequency
spectrum
of
white
noise
at
a
frequency
analyzer
you
will
find
that
the
spectrum
power
density
is
flat
which
means
that
every
frequency
is
present
in
the
noise
signal
often
pink
noise
is
obtained
from
white
noise
by
integrating
of
lowpass
filtering
a
white
noise
signal
therefore
pink
noise
contains
much
more
lowfrequency
components
the
effect
of
pink

is
sometimes
used

does
it

at

oversampling
takes
two

points

interpolates

between
them
for
n
times

when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
understanding
the
filtering
is
not
interpolation
as
that
would
distort
the
frequency
content
of
the
signal
they
do
interpolate
its
not
linear
interpolation
though
you
are
correct
that
the
frequency
content
is
not
altered
more
specifically
the
baseband
spectrum
is
preserved
and
so
is
every
nth
image
spectrum
the
other
in
n
image
spectra
are
removed
where
n
is
the
oversampling
rate
you
are
listening

generally
these
players
run
the
samples
thru
an
allpass
filter
network
i
have
done
this
for
ecg
waveforms
from
a
persons
ideally
the
filter
has
a
gain
of
from
to
and
a
gain
of
from
to
the
new
nyquist
frequency
in
practice
a
finite

band
is
required

there
is
also
a
certain
amount
of
passband

about
observations
of

filter
at
work
in
case
you
care
the
filtering
method
uses
an
fir
finite
impulse
response
filter
id
guess
that
cd
makers
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybody
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tapped
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weighting
to
accomplish
the
filtering
this
strikes
me
as
the
most
cost
effective
method
for
volume
production
runs
no
they
actually
use
a
digital
fir
just
like
yours
but
built
in
hardware
on
custom
vlsi
chips
for
mainly
economic
reasons
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering
actually
i
think
the
only
reason
they
do
this
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
marketting
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acutally
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampled
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
components
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
its
too
bad
that
they
charge
more
for
something
that
i
think
is
actually
less
costly
to
build
i
guess
that
the
answer
is
somewhere
between
the
two

accept
the

a

of

points
about
bingo
cards
free
industry
magazines
like
edn
and
such
also
log
your
card
to
their

they
use
the
information
at
least
three
ways
they
note
that
you
really
do
read
the
magazine
and
are
more
likely
to
continue
your
subscription
or
push
you
through
repeated
mailings
to
resubscribe
they
also
compile
how
many
people
requested
which
data
for

demographics
this
way
thay
can
tell
a
prospective
advertiser
that
of
readers
requesting
data
were
interested
in
capacitors
and
finally
some
magazines
rent
lists
of
readers
who
request
certain
information
for
example
tektronics
can
rent
a
list
of
everyone
who
requested
information
about
test
equipment
other
than
tektronics
in
the
past
months
the
other
point
in
the
data
the
advertiser
receives
many
magazines
include
how
many
items
you
circled
on
the
card
if
they
want
the
advertiser
can
attempt
to
cull
out
the
literature
collectors
from
the
serious
potential

could
whats
the
best
way
for
a
hobbiest
to
deal
with

cards
never
circle
more
than
number
on
the
card
if
you
want
more
than
items
use
the
second
card
and
mail
it
a
couple
of
weeks
later
if
you
are
really
really
serious
and
you

copy

only
serves
one
pur
pose
to
keep
the
honest

from

copies
it
will
definitely
not
stop
any
pirates
if
you
want
to
protect
you
soft
supply
a
good
documentation
and
support
this
is
imho
the
only
way
of
effectively
protecting
software
there
are
several
types
of
copy
protection
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
using
a
legitimate
copy
the
simplest
and
virtually
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixate
itself
to
the
machine
it
was
installed
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatever
so
a
copy
put
on
a
different
machine
not
installed
from
original
disks
will
not
work
the
program
is
definitely
backupable
if
restored
to
the
same
machine
depends
on
the
programmer
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characteristic
if
the
user
did
an
upgrade
to
the
machine
heshe
should
reinstall
all
programs
any
way
no

lookup
no

wearandtear
i
did
not
say
that
the
originals
would
allow
only
one
install
the
users
conscience
should
do
that
i
know
ill
get
flamed
for
this
but
with
the
increasing
number
of
casual
users
who
either
unknowingly
or
dont
care
about
the
software
copyrights
its
the
truth
i
have
friends
who
ask
me
for
copies
of
my
latest
games
all
the
time
and
when
i
refused
they
went
after
somebody
else
casual
pirating
is
becoming
more
of
a
problem
some
sort
of
copy
protection
will
discourage
the
casual
copying
ive
seen
what
some
of
my
friends
dug
up
somewhere
latest

the

you

dont
ask
me
which
ones
they
are
determined
pirates
are
unstoppable
given
enough
time
but
their
results
do
not
spread
that
far
since
pirate
boards
are
not
that
wellknown
and
easily
tracked
once
found
by
authorities
it
is
the
casual
pirates
that
the
copy
protection
is
determined
to
discourage
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
this
way
the
legitimate
users
who
does
not
register
will
experience
minimal
discomfort
who
does
major
upgrades
to
their
computer
frequently
as
only
problem
they
have
is
they
wont
be
able
to
restore
to
another

the
registered

would
have
proven
they
are

therefore

is
none
of
them
are
completely
secure
or
anywhere
near
it
some
are
more
or
less
difficult
to
crack
and
some
have
already
been
cracked
i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
question
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
answer
what
exactly
do
you
want
to
know
do
you
need
a
good
one
for
a
project
you
are
working
on
how
secure
must
it
be
are
you
trying
to
crack
one
that
someone
else
has
used
i
can
probably
make
suggestions
assuming
the
activity
is
strictly
legal
in
general
it
is
a
bad
idea
legally
to
tamper
with
copy
protection
it
can
also
lead
to
corruption
of
files
which
you
necessarily
do
not
have
back
ups
of
being
as
they
are
copy
protected
which
can
be
devestating
do
you
have
absolutely
no
ideas
for
practical
applications
and
are
merely
curious
please
clear
up
those
questions
and
ill
try
to
help
as
much
as
i
can
incidentally
the
uh
oh
at
the
top
is
indicative
of
the
dread
anyone
who
has
watched
their
friends
hacking
equipment
be
carted
off
feels
when
they
are
asked
how
to
hack
the
area
you
are
broaching
is
wrought
with
dangers
many
of
which
include
breaking
the
law
or
at
least
addressing
it
from
one
side
or
the
other
matt
i
have
written
a
program
and
i
want
to
market
it
i
would
like
certain
degree
of
protection
since
my
main
custmers
are
individuals
and
not
the
cooperations
i
know
laser
hole
burning
method
and
hardware
key
method
however
my
software
is
going
to
cost
only
so
i
can
not
afford
that
also
at
this
low
price
i
can
not
afford
people
make
too
many
copy
of
my
software
well
i
guess
say
upto
illigal
copying
is
ok
by
me
however
i
do
not
want
someone
to
get
a
copy
of
pctools
and
copy
my
software
off
course
i
never
meant
to
forbid
the
true
hackers
from
copying
since
they
can
develope
a
better
program
anyway
with
highest
regards
babak
sehari
one
of
the
most
popular
methods
of
course
is
the
password
check
where
they
ask
you
for
a
word
from
page
x
line
y
and
word
z
but
this
is
pitifully
simple
to
remove
unless
you
throw
some
checksums
into
the
main
part
of
your
program
and
some
selfrewriting
code
to
confuse
some
people
also
make
sure
that
your
program
can
not
be
run
out
a
debugger
another
method
of
course
is
to
not
even
make
bad
sectors
on
the
original
disk
just
write
a
certain
key
to
a
certain
unallocated
sector
to
help
you
here
you
also
must
do
the
code
protection
schemes
mentioned
in
the
first
paragraph
make
sure
you
also
fill
the
rest
of
the
unallocated
parts
of
the
disk
with
garbage
as
well
or
they
wanna
be
crackers
can
just
look
for
the
junk
in
some
random
sector
like
you
mentioned
there
are
the
laser
holed
disks
and
hardware
keys
but
they
are
both
expensive
and
a
pain
in
the
butt
for
the
enduser
which
you
is
the
opposite
of
what
you
want
another
configuration
that
can
be
used
is
to
save
the
configuration
of
the
machine
that
it
is
being
installed
to
in
the
most
undecipherable
format
you
can
think
of
if
the
program
does
not
find
that
this
is
the
same
system
it
requests
being
installed
by
the
original
disk
again
the
original
disk
should
be
encrypted
compacted
have
many
sectors
that
should
be
checked
and
anything
else
you
can
think
of
to
make
sure
that
the
original
cannot
be
copied
once
again
you
must
put
codeencryption
selfrewriting
code
and
multiple
crc
checks
in
the
program
to
make
sure
that
it
does
not
get
changed
among
other
things
this
also
protects
your
program
from
virii
if
the
program
detects
a
change
in
its
code
tell
the
user
that
a
virus
has
been
detected
in
the
program
tell
them
the
program
is
virus
secure
and
remember
you
have
helped
the
world
kill
some
pirating
and
kill
some
viruses
feel
good
i
hope
that
i
have
helped
have
fun
knock
some
cracking
out
well
you
cant
do
it
everything
that
can
be
written
can
be
cracked
but
youll
pissem
off
in
the
process
goodbye

yes
its

well
actually
not

both
radar

radioaltimeters
measure
distances
by
measuring
the
time
required
to
transmit

then
receive
its

generally

originally

that

since
radio
waves
will
actually
travel
faster
in
freespace
air
in
this
case
than
wire
the
difference
is
called
the
velocity
factor
of
the
cable
so
you
need
to
resort
to
a
common
timebase
that
is
automatically
corrected
for
distance
etc
something
like
a
pll
connected
to
a
gps
receiver
should
do
the
trick
triggering
both
the
transmitter
and
receiver
simultaneously
sound
expensive
not
too
bad
but
plan
on
spending
a
few
bucks
in
both
equipment
and
effort
why
not
go
to
a
different
method
surveyors
use
a
laserlight
system
where
again
the
reflection
time
is
measured
why
not
try
this
sounds
like
something
a
pe
should
know
about
anyway
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
this
is
actually
highly
inaccurate
since
the
power
output
of
a
transmitter
varies
from
unit
to
unit
there
are
variances
in
the
antenna
and
transmission
line
and
the
receiver
may
also
vary
both
from
unit
to
unit
and
the
same
unit
over
time
you
would
need
to
continuously
calibrate
the
entire
system
with
the
radio
altimeter
this
is
also
done
but
since
everything
is
located
at
one
place
it
is
much
easier
to
do
note
especially
that
the
time
base
for
the
ra
receiver
and
transmitter
is
one
unit
also
depends
on
the
environment
in
a
static
environent
such
as
a
waveguide
yes
in
a
dynamic
environment
with
objects
moving
about
the
multipath
kills
this
concept
nope
fm
capture
effect
says
that
the
strongest
signal
wins
that
is
unless
the
two
interfering
signals
are
seperated
by
more
than
db
in
signal
strength
this
is
the
one
problem
that
makes
altimeters
inaccurate
at
very
low
altitudes
signals
bouncing
off
runways
tend
to
be
very
strong
what
frequencies
would
be
best
for
this
or
does
matter
as
high
as
possible
to
eliminate
outside
influence
and
also
to
enhance
attenuation
of
multipath
signals
radio
altimeters
typically
use
frequencies
around
ghz
hope
this
helps

there
are
several
types
of
copy
protection
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
using
a
legitimate
copy
the
simplest
and
virtually
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixate
itself
to
the
machine
it
was
installed
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatever
so
a
copy
put
on
a
different
machine
not
installed
from
original
disks
will
not
work
okay
so
what
do
you
do
if
some
part
of
the
machine
presumably
the
part
on
which
the
code
number
or
whatever
that
the
program
has
fixated
itself
upon
goes
bad
you
replace
that
part
and
now
your
program
wont
run
because
its
on
a
different
computer
this
is
of
course
assuming
that
the
program
uses
something
in
rom
like
the
bios
serial
number
maybe
and
not
a
diskbased
code
number
obviously
if
the
drive
goes
bad
youll
be
reinstalling
the
stuff
anyway
i
work
in
a
computer
lab
which
is
part
of
the
university
microlab
system
we
have
the
wonderfully
fun
task
of
maintaining
well
over
a
hundred
machines
both
pc
and
macintosh
as
well
as
administering
a
network
of
over
next
machines
i
personally
am
concerned
only
with
a

with
ten
pcs

ten
macs
im
not

but
help
him
with

often
imho
copyprotection
schemes
of
any
sort
are
nothing
more
than
a
major
headache
for
the
legitimate
user
anyone
who
wants
a
copy
of
your
program
and
doesnt
care
about
legality
will
get
a
copy
period
pirate
board
or
no
pirate
board
i
too
have
friends
who
blatantly
and
quite
successfuly
hack
copy
protection
schemes
practically
in
their
sleep
lets
consider
what
goes
on
in
our
lab
almost
daily
we
have
at
least
one
machine
down
sometimes
several
due
to
some
goofball
screwing
up
some
setting
or
other
on
a
piece
of
software
admittedly
we
being
students
mostly
are
not
the
worlds
most
efficient
and
effective
network
administrators
but
we
try
keeping
even
the
twenty
machines
that
are
partly
my
responsibility
even
vaguely
looking
and
acting
similar
to
the
average
user
and
maintaining
behindthescenes
consistency
is
a
real
headache
but
not
so
bad
a
headache
as
trying
to
remember
twenty
different
folder
locations
of
norton
utilities
when
some
guy
trashes
his
disk
often
we
have
hardware
problems
at
peak
business
times
and
have
to
do
some
partsswapping
to
get
stuff
working
temporarily
well
ill
cut
to
the
chase
and
quit
boring
yall
the
point
is
often
we
have
to
reinstall
software
and
copy
configuration
files
etc
from
machine
to
machine
by
far
the
easiest
way
we
have
found
to
do
this
is
to
get
one
machine
working
exactly
the
way
we
want
to
then
copy
the
complete
setup
of
this
machine
to
the
other
nine
of
that
machines
type
this
ensures
us
that
for
at
least
ten
minutes
we
have
ten
identical
machines
to
work
with
having
them
networked
simplifies
this
considerably
as
our
major
packages
wordperfect
windows
etc
are
all
network
versions
and
thus
only
one
copy
to
mess
with
often
however
we
need
to
install
a
package
requested
by
some
instructor
to
one
some
or
all
of
the
machines
for
a
special
project
this
is
usually
a
handwritten
or
sharewareetc
program
similar
to
what
i
believe
the
original
poster
was
asking
about
the
few
we
have
had
with
copy
protection
schemes
have
caused
nothing
but
nightmares
for
us
to
maintain
in
short
dont
waste
your
time
with
a
copy
protection
scheme
its
sort
of
like
outlawing
guns
the
criminals
will
get
your
program
anyway
and
you
will
only
be
hurting
the
legitimate
honest
user
write
a
good
users
guide
and
tech
manual
whatever
else
for
your
program
please
do
this
regardless
of
whether
you
copy
protect
the
thing
and
only
distribute
the
manual
to
licensed
users
jack
the
price
to
cut
your
losses

please
take
a
cue
from
the
major

can
admittedly
afford
the

their

do
not
spread

since
pirate
boards
are
not

easily
tracked
once
found

it
is
the
casual
pirates
that
the
copy

is
determined
to
discourage
what
i
believe
the

should
do
is
implement
the

a

once
the

registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered

xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
this
way
the
legitimate
users
who
does
not
register
will
experience
minimal
discomfort
who
does
major
upgrades
to
their
computer
frequently
as
only
problem
they
have
is
they
wont
be
able
to
restore
to
another

the
registered

would
have
proven
they
are
legitmate
users
and
therefore
gains
full

and
can
restore

keep
the

definitely
not

any

if
you

this
is
imho
the
only
way
of
effectively
pro

best
regards
arno
i
strongly
disagree
i
think
most
pirating
is
done
by
amateurs
who
wont
copy
the
program
if
diskcopy
cant
do
it
if
youre
talking
a
max
goal
of
pirated
copies
i
bet
that
anything
that
will
beat
diskcopy
and
cant
be
easily
copied
from
a
hard
drive
will
suffice
i
hate
hard
copy
manuals
and
would
rather
have
all
docs
online
not
because
i
want
to
copy
the
program
but
because
its
usually
faster
and
and
convenient
than
sifting
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
off
deeper
end
why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your
backups
i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the

i
was
just
wondering
one
thing
actually
two
i
hope
that
this
is
the
proper
place
to
post
this
subject
why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
thanks
i
am
not
a
battery
expert
but
from
recent
reading
a
lead
acid
battery
will
self
discharge
at
a
relatively
high
rate
and
if
stored
in
a
discharged
state
will
develop
a
condition
i
think
is
called
sulfation
in
storage
either
the
electrolyte
should
be
removed
and
replaced
for
use
fat
chance
id
ever
do
that
at
home
or
the
battery
should
be
stored
on
a
trickle
charge
i
have
also
i
think
read
that
the
condition
may
be
reversable
if
hooked
up
to
a
current
limited
charging
circuit
fro
a
long
period
of
time
the
refernce
i
remember
is
to
use
where
c
is
the
amp
hours
as
the
charging
circuit
and
leave
it
hooked
up
for
weeks
some
of
this
may
only
apply
to
gel
type
cells
but
i
suspect
the
same
applies
to
the
liquid
type

i
hate
hard
copy
manuals
and
would
rather
have
all
docs
online
not
because
i
want
to
copy
the

but
because
its
usually
faster
and
and
convenient
than
sifting
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
just
mho
but
i
prefer
hardcopy
books
because
you
can
have
three
or
four
of
them
open
spread
across
the
bed
next
to
the
desk
in
my
dorm
and
reference
them
while
using
the
program
fullscreen
the
windows
help
things
come
closest
to
good
online
documentation
ive
seen
but
they
generally
arent
detailed
enough
and
would
probably
take
a
large
amount
of
space
even
compressed
which
is
at
a
premium
on
my
system
in
fact
the
manuals
are
the
primary
reason
i
bought
borlands
c
compiler
instead
of
using
the
one
the
lab
licensed
in
the
lab
of
course
ive
got
a
shelf
full
of
books
to
help
me
out
when
im
stuck
to
each
his
own
off
deeper
end
why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your
backups
i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the
backups
weve
destroyed
about
six
sets
of
original
microsoft
word
for
mac
and
word
for
windows
may
have
been
a
bad
batch
of
disks
dont
have
the
faintest
idea
what
happened
to
them
they
just
went
bad
werent
stored
near
any
magnetic
fields
or
otherwise
mistreated
indeed
they
were
only
used
once
given
this
and
the
massive
headaches
finding
a
working
set
of
disks
to
fix
some
of
the
machines
that
periodically
go
down
id
say
having
working
backups
is
a
godsend
i
sure
wish
wed
had
them
sometimes
i
think
murphys
law
holds
true
more
often
than
newtons
when
we
needed
them
i
think
its
sortof
like
snake
antivenin
of
the
time
you
have
absolutely
no
use
for
it
but
when
you
need
it
boy
do
you
ever
need
it
i
dont
have
backups
of
my
originals
at
home
but
then
my
machine
doesnt
see
anywhere
near
the
useabuse
of
these
here
at
the
lab
and
so
i
consider
it
less
of
a
risk
still
i
usually
make
working
copies
of
them
when
i
install
them
and
then
eventually
reuse
these
working
copies
for
something
else
no
flames
intended
just
my
thoughts
just
mine
too
btw
before
anyone
notices
my
mentioning
copying

from

when
we

into
the
bottom

shadowed
in
the
bottom

what

many

you

then
do
it
all
again
for
the

this
took
all
of
the

time
during
the
visible

of
the
display
there
was
also
a
standard
ram
io
timer
riot
plus
a
voltage
regulator
and
if
memory
serves
a
timer
thats
all
the
ram
was
mapped
into
the
top
bytes
of

and
shadowed
in

the
has
a
zeropage
addressing
mode
on
most
instructions
that
is
both
shorter
and
faster
than
the
normal
ones
so
it
is
important
on
a
machine
like
this
to
have
the
scratchpad
ram
in

unfortunately
it
also
wants
its
stack
to
be
in

the
stack
pointer
is
bits

the
high

each
bit
could
be
independantly
set

o
like
the

bit
timer
with
a
programmable
prescaler
i
think
this
was
some
power
of
there
were
no
interrupts
in
the
system
so
many
games
would
set
up
the
timer
at
some
known
time
go
away
and
do
something
else
for
a
while
then
sit
and
wait
for
the
timer
to
run
down
there
was
no
logic
in
the

to
do
address
decoding
the
riot
had
at
least
chip
select
pins
probably
one
active
high
one
active
low
and
i
imagine
the
tia
was
much
the
same
various
address
lines
were
fed
directly
to

selects
the
likes
to
have

the

most

list
that

tia
stands
for
television
interface
adapter

it
handles
sound
paddles
and
the
minimal

hardware
the
possessed
didnt
know
about
it
being
called
the
thats
the

found
in
the
commodore
i
dont
believe
this
chip
existed
when
the
was
around
yes
the
same
number
but
an
entirely
different
device
i
should
have
qualified
this
further
by
stating
that
this
was
the
pal
version
of
the
tia
i
am
not
sure
that
the
ntsc
tia
would
have
a
different

the
tia
was
mapped
into
the
bottom
bytes
of
page
and
shadowed
in
the
bottom
bytes
of
page
to
get
an
image
on
the
screen
you
had
to
wait
until
the
raster
line
your

started
at
load
bitmaps
for
this
line
into
the
sprite
registers
tell
them
what
x
positions
to
take
how
many
duplicates
you
wanted
etc
then
do
it
all
again
for
the
next
line
this
took
all
of
the
processors
time
during
the
visible
portion
of
the
display
does
anyone
on
the
net
actually
have
details
of
the
tia
as
this
is
the
only
device
i
have
not
yet
discovered
details
about

when
asked
claimed
that
their

so
the

saw
a

with

hooked

hi
i
am
looking
an
integrated

for
my
computer
the
circuit
is
called
serial
timer
interrupt
and
made
by
mostek
mostek
is
called
sgs
thompson
today
i
have
been
in
contact
with
sgs
thompson
unfortunately
they
me
told
that
is
obsolete
so
my
question
is
if
anyone
know
if
i
can
get
hold
of
that
circuits
are
there
any
companies
that
specialize
in
selling
circuits
that
are
no
longer
in
production
i
have
contacted
several
electronic
brokers
in
sweden
but
without
any
success
i
would
appreciate
if
you
could
give
me
hint
where
i
should
continue
looking
even
companies
in
the
united
states
would
be
fine
since
this
circuit
is
pretty
crucial
to
me

even
compressed
which
is
at
a
premium
on

got

flip

why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the
hard

so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your

i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the

weve
destroyed
about
six

dont

they
just
went

mistreated
indeed
they
were
only

some
of
the

periodically
go

id
say
having
working

is
a
godsend
i
sure
wish
wed
had
them
sometimes
i
think
murphys
law
holds
true
more
often
than
newtons
when
we
needed
them
i
think
its
sortof
like
snake
antivenin
of
the
time
you
have
absolutely
no
use
for
it
but
when
you
need
it
boy
do
you
ever
need
it
dittos
in
fact
at
work
where
things
are
dead
if
the
backup
is
no
good
i
insist
on
having
at
least
a
level
backup
system
it
seems
that
whenever
you
have
good
backups
you
never
need
them
but
if
you
dont
have
them
murphy
guarantees
that
youll
suffer
for
it
i
dont
have
backups
of
my
originals
at
home
but
then
my
machine
doesnt
see
anywhere
near
the
useabuse
of
these
here
at
the

and
so
i
consider
it
less
of
a
risk
still
i
usually

i
would
put
a

around

it
would
be
nearly
impossible

solution
was
to
carry

when

wouldnt
start

spray
all
the
likely
areas

it
would
then
start

recently
decided
to
chuck
the

and
learn
the
black
magic
art
of
switching
power
supplies
before
anyone
flames
me
i
know
both
have

ive
built
the
basic
up

with
pretty
good
results
efficiency
but
im
running
into
problems
when
i
try
to
design
build
anything
that
puts
out
serious
amps
i
know
it
can
be
done
i
have
some
guts
on
my
bench
but
something
puzzles
me
im
using
a
simple
choke
as
the
storage
element
basicly
a
toroid
with
a
single
winding
but
all
commercial
models
use
transformers
with
many
windings
i
traced
a
few
and
they
seem
to
use
some
of
the
winding
for
the
usual
errorfeedback
but
some
of
the
others
seem
to
loose
me
what
are
they
for
better
than
that
anyone
have
a
full
schematic
for
one
of
these
that
i
could
get
a

of
id
love
to
see
how
they
manage
to
squeeze
out
so
much
from
such
low
volume
my
other
problems
in
getting
high
amps
good

are
lack

ideal
components
calculated

limited
knowledge
of
the

im
doing
this

own
not

mind
you
in

i
have

take
any
course
that
covers
transistors
so
is
the
answer
to
the
accumulation
of
dead
commercial
models
and
truning
into
a
scavanger
not
that
its
not

how

either
the

skimp

cooling

hmmmmm
there
is
a
correclation

it

i
dont

that
everyone
run

create

stoveamplifiers

a

is
much
more
suceptible
to

variation
with
varrying

than
is

i
built
a
little
project
using
the
radio
shack
relays
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretty
bad
clicks
when
the
thing
switched
i
was
doing
most
of
the
common
things
one
is
supposed
to
do
when
using
relays
and
nothing
seemed
to
get
rid
of
the
clicks
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switching
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
noise
of
any
kind
on
the
audio
lines
i
will
appreciate
any
advice
or
references
to
advice
also
exact
part
numberscompany
names
etc
for
the
relays
will
help
the
first
step
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
dc
component
intentional
or
not
on
the
audio
lines
to
be
switched
if
neither
the
output
or
input
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
lets
say
theyre
capacitively
coupled
then
putting
a
k
resistor
from
each
input
to
ground
and
from
the
output
to
ground
is
a
good
precaution
against
leakage
in
any
coupling
caps
presenting
a
dc
level
that
is
guaranteed
to
cause
a
click
if
the
device
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
that
is
from
more
than
just
coupling
capacitor
leakage
then
you
need
to
remove
the
dc
before
switching
with
coupling
capacitors
of
your
own
if
you
have
more
than
one
relay
each
relay
switching
one
input
through
to
a
common
output
you
can
use
makebeforebreak
switching
where
for
a
brief
instant
both
sources
are
connected
during
a
switch
change
this
may
mask
the
switch
click
an
audio
switch
that
is
clickless
is
made
by
taking
a
light
bulb
and
making
your
own
ersatz
optoisolator
with
a
lightdependent
resistor
ldr
sealed
inside
a
piece
of
black
heatshrink
many
broadcast
consoles
use
this
older
but
timehonored
technique
claro
actually
makes
a
complete
optisolator
like
this
but
i
dont
have
a
part
number
handy
radio
shack
has
a
ldr
grabbag
you
might
want
to
try
for
a
simple
solid
state
clickless
switch
that
is
cheap
you
might
try
looking
at
the
analog
switch
that
is
commonly
available
or
its
older
predecessor
the
again
the
dc
component
must
be
removed
prior
to
switching
other
alternatives
include
jfet
switches
both
discrete
and
ic
and
diode
switching
which
works
relatively
well
surprisingly
all
the
above
with
their
pitfalls
and
application
tips
could
easily
make
a
subject
for
a
multipage
article
solid
state
switches
may
induce
a
click
of
their
own
when
turned
on
due
to
charge
being
injected
into
the
audio
line
through
device
capacitance
when
the
control
signal
changes
state
techniques
to
minimize
this
include
lowering
the
impedance
of
the
signal
paths
through
the
switch
differential
switching
and
slowing
the
risetime
of
the
control
pulse
with
the
cutting
the
click
can
be
as
simple
as
putting
resistors
in
series
with
the
control
pins

this

at

down

hard

therefore

a

of
who

you

around

oh
yes
it
also
needs
to
be
cheap
my
first
circuit
was
a
dismal
failure
i
used
compariators
each
compariator
had
the
input
going
to
one
of
the
guns
the
input
went
to
a
reference
created
by
a
voltage
dividera
potentiometer
the
first
problem
was
that
the
compariator
was
way
too
slow
i
needed
to
get
several
pixels
in
a
row
before
it
would
fire
the
compariators
so
i
could
have
a
whole
screen
full
of
text
but
my
the
second
problem
is
that
there
was
more
noise
on
the
reference
then
the
smallest
difference
between
a
blank
screen
and
a
dim
screen
in
fact
the
difference
between
completely
black

is
only

to
amplify

to
make

compariators
but
they
are
expensive
and

need
to
replace
my
quad
compariator
with
three
compariators
and
create
a
whole
new
power
supply
circuit
at

point
i
think
what
i
need
is
some
sort
of
transistor
circuit
transistors
are
fast

cheap

should
do

unfortunately
i

from
current
limited
at
voltage
must
stay
within
of

for
i
from
ac
ripple
less
than

rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could

from

evolved
more
and
more
demands
were
made
of
them
first
boards
were
used
mainly
in
audio
circuitry
couldnt
be
used
in
high
voltage
or
rf
because
it
would
arc
and
burn
most
boards
today
are
fiberglass
the
type
being
chosen
by
its
use
and
cost
boards
in
satellite
and
microwave
communication
are
teflon
and
ceramic
as
the
fiberglass
and
other
boards
are
conductive
they
actually
work
more
as
a
capacitive
dialectric
but
the
word
conductive
simplifies
explaination

another

material
used

interconnections

a

mylar
material

connect

instead

harnesses

what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon

registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
you
take
two
copies
with
a
different
registration
id
compare
them
byte
for
byte
and
you
know
where
they
are
located
usually
you
will
be
able
to
find
out
what
is
what
after
that
probably
but
the
point
is
the
company
make
the
registration
patch
not
you
sure
you
can
probably
find
another
registerred
user
and
compare
notes
but
why
its
not

you
in
any
way
unless
you
are

public
domain
yellow
brick
road
tinseltown
or
something
nothing
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggestion
im
saying
that
you
register
via
mail
by
mailing
in
your
registration
card
then
the
company
send
you
the
patch
which
includes
the
info
you
put
on

kasey
chang
im
glad
to
see
this
idea
come
up

ive

in

what
if
you
had
an
authorization
key
that
computed
from
the
name
and
address
data
when
the
user
registers
you
dont
even
need
to
send

code
just
compute
hisher
key

send
himher
instructions
to
enter
in
the
appropriate

the

namejoe

cityanytown

every
user
needs
a
unique

the
executable
can
propagate
as
much
as
you
like
the
author
can
respond
to
the
registration
by

whatever
unauthorized
users
would

to
put
up
with
someone
elses
name
showing

on

thank
you
i
know
exactly

too
i
just
said
dont
ask
me
which

i
didnt
say
i
dont
know
what
that
means
such
hacking
can
be
easily
discouraged
by
adding
antipatching
code
which
does
a
selfcheck
upon
execution
and
refuse
to
load
if
crc
does
not
match
value
stored
encrypted
of
course
in
the
program
it
could
be
claimed
as
a
part
of
antivirus
code
and
it
would
not
be
far
from
the
truth
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
this
is
by
far
the
best
idea
you
presented
in
your
post
making
it
plainly
obvious
who
registered
is
going
to
stop
casual
pirates
but
the
determined
ones
are
just
going
to
answer
joe
blow
to
the
question
of
whats
your
name
so
this
wont
stop
them
in
the
long
run
did
anyone
read
what
i
wrote
that
is
not
what
i
wrote
or
meant
what
i
said
was
the
program
should
have
certain
restriction
such
as
the
restricttoonemachine
until
the
program
is
registered
with
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
will
then
supply
the
thenprovenlegitimateuser
with
a
patch
that
will
disable
the
restriction
and
proudly
proclaim
the
legal
copy
with
the
registered
to
xxx
screen
pirates
are
always
going
to
win
this
fight
they
simply
have
more
time
to
work
on
the
software
and
figure
out
the
protection
scheme
of
course
they
will
but
that
was
not
my
point
the
purpose
of
copy
protection
is
to
discourage
casual
pirates
oh
can
i
have
a
copy
of
thatsure
here
and
the
less
sophisticated
pirates
lets
look
for
all
those
calls
to
any
one
determined
enough
to
break
copy
protection
can
and
will
succeed
they
can
always
backtrace
the
entire
loadsequence
of
the
program
the
point
of
copy
protection
is
to
make
such
attempts
take
as
long
as
possible
while
not
intruding
upon
the
uses
or
to
minimize
such
intrusion
of
legitimate
use
pirates
who
see
copy
protection
as
a
challenge
love
breaking
them
and
no
amount
of
copy
protection
will
stop

but
the
rest

he
couldnt
tell
me
why
this
topic
was
beaten
to
death
a
year
or
so
ago
the
concrete
is
not
the
problem
leadacid
batteries
often
fail
from
disuse
not
being
charged
for
a
long
time
but
theres
no
way
the
concrete
floor
could
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
the
concrete
floor
accelerates
the
problem
because
it
is
a
heat
sink
and
a
colder
leadacid
battery
selfdischarges
at
a
slightly
faster
rate
thats
why
the
old
wives
tale
of
sitting
it
on
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
floor
works
to
help
keep
from
killing
the
battery
as
fast
it
insulates
the
battery
thermally
it
youll
set
the
battery
down
on

it

best
thing
would
be
to
attach
a
small

such
as
a
small
transistor
radio
with
the
volume
turned
down
low
and
leave
it
on
constantly
but
also
tricklecharge
it
every
couple
days
too
to
shallow
cycle
the
charge
in
the
battery
such
mild
exercising
of
a
leadacid
battery
is
the
next
best
thing
to
completely
removing
the
electrolyte
for
storage
if
you
do
remove
the
electrolyte
may
sure
you
keep
separate
storage
containers
for
each
cells
electrolyte
and
put
it
back
into
the
same
cells
when
you
refill
the
battery
this
isnt
so
critical
for
a
brandnew
battery
in
a
fully
charged
state
but
will
maximize
the
restored
output
of
an

which
may
not

a

bet
that
anything

you

at

have

a

method
the
initial
requirement
was
to
design
a
system
to
locate
a
dancer
in
one
of
eight
zones
across
the
stage
i
did
some
experiments
with
pyroelectric
detectors
and
found
them
difficult
to
align
to
get
a
definite
zone
transition
and
dancers
stand
still
alot
so
their
ir
signature
goes
away
the
good
thing
about
pryoelectrics
is
that
their
signal
is
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
warm
body
or
body
part
and
the
velocity
of
said
body
this
could
be
useful
for
detecting
the
intensity
of
a
dance
gesture
dancers
also
really
hate
to
wear
little
boxes
and
batteries
strapped
on
their
bodies

they
really
need

re
switching
ps
questions
anyways
ive
built
the
basic
up
down
converters
with
pretty
good
results
efficiency
but
im
running
into
problems
when
i
try
to
design
build
anything
that
puts
out
serious
amps
i
know
it
can
be
done
i
have
some
guts
on
my
bench
but
something
puzzles
me
im
using
a
simple
choke
as
the
storage
element
basicly
a
toroid
with
a
single
winding
but
all
commercial
models
use
transformers
with
many
windings
i
traced
a
few
and
they
seem
to
use
some
of
the
winding
for
the
usual
errorfeedback
but
some
of
the
others
seem
to
loose
me
what
are
they
for
better
than
that
anyone
have
a
full
schematic
for
one
of
these
that
i
could
get
a
copy
of
id
love
to
see
how
they
manage
to
squeeze
out
so
much
from
such
low
volume
most
commercial
switchers
do
not
use
magnetics
for
their
energy
storage
thats
handled
by
the
big
caps
on
the
primary
side
those
which
in
a
linearlyregulated
power
supply
would
be
considered
the
filter
caps
coming
right
after
the
bridge
the
transformer
is
just
that
a
transformer
its
there
primarily
to
step
the
voltage
up
or
down
although
the
inductance
seen
by
the
switch
transistor
on
the
primary
side
is
not
negligible
as
anyone
whos
zapped
said
transistor
from
either
failing
to
get
one
with
a
high
enough
breakdown
voltage
or
neglecting
to
include
a
snubber
diode
across
it
would
tell
you
actually
many
transistors
intended
for
switcher
use
today
have
the
diode
built
in
the
basic
switchedmode
power
supply
operates
something
like
this
in
a
somewhat
simplified
manner
the
ac
line
is
rectified
to
produce
a
high
voltage
moreorless
unregulated
dc
rail
the
energy
storage
or
filter
caps
appear
across
this
rail
as
does
the
switching
transistor
the
transistor
chops
the
current
into
the
primary
side
of
the
transformer
resulting
in
steppedup
or
steppeddown
pulses
out
the
secondary
which
are
then
rectified
and
filtered
at
least
one
of
the
transformers
outputs
is
sampled
and
fed
back
to
the
control
circuit
for
the
switching
transistor
which
acts
in
a
pulsewidth
modulation
pwm
fashion
to
control
by
varying
the
pulse
width
the
amount
of
energy
being
dumped
into
the
primary
and
therefore
the
voltage
coming
out
at
the
secondary
the
remaining
outputs
may
be
allowed
to
simply
run
at
whatever
value
they
will
moreorless
tracking
the
regulated
output
or
they
may
have
some
additional
linear
regulation
added
you
may
also
note
that
the
feedback
between
the
regulated
output
and
the
pwm
control
which
is
most
typically
an
ic
is
not
done
via
a
direct
electrical
connection
this
is
due
to
various
safety
standards
which
require
primary
and
secondary
circuits
to
be
electrically
isolated
often
the
feedback
path
involves
an
optoisolator
to
meet
this
requirement
while
the
transformer
isnt
the
primary
energystorage
device
in
these
designs
this
does
not
mean
that
the
energy
stored
in
the
transformer
can
be
ignored
besides
the
inductive
kick
giving
the
switch
transistor
a
bad
time
as
noted
above
you
also
need
to
worry
about
getting
all
the
energy
that
went
in
to
the
transformer
back
out
again
one
way
or
another
in
some
designs
this
happens
more
or
less
automatically
but
in
others
you
need
to
take
special
care
to
ensure
that
the
transformer
core
doesnt
saturate
which
again
would
have
disastrous
results
best
left
to
the
imagination
im
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination

powersupply
designer
hopefully
a
real
one
will
come
along
soon
and
clean

i
was

one
thing

i
hope

this

post
this
subject
why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
its
not
the
concrete
floor
that
does
it
the
problem
is
that
leadacid

discharge
over
time
even
high
quality
cells
gates
for
instance
will
discharge
over
a
month
period
of
time
nonsealed
cells
self
discharge
even
faster
if
the
battery
was
not
completly
charged
when
left
sitting
it
probably
discharged
past
the
the
point
where
cell
sulfiding
occurs

in

cases
means

re

here
is
a
different
viewpoint
fyi
the
actual
horizontal
dot
placement
resoution
of
an
hp
deskjet
is
inch
the
electronics
and
dynamics
of
the
ink
cartridge
however
limit
you
to
generating
dots
at
per
inch
on
almost
any
paper
the
ink
wicks
more
than
inch
anyway
the
method
of
depositing
and
fusing
toner
of
a
laster
printer
results
in
much
less
spread
than
ink
drop
technology
in
practice
there
is
little
difference
in
quality
but
more
care
is
needed
with
inkjet
because
smudges
etc
can
happen
it
doesnt
take
much
investigation
to
see
that
the
mechanical
and
electronic
complement
of
a
laser
printer
is
more
complex
than
inexpensive
ink
jet
printers
recall
also
that
laser
printers
offer
a
much
higher
throughput
ppm
for
a
laser
versus
about
ppm
for
an
ink
jet
printer
a
cheap
laser
printer
does
not
manage
that
sort
of
throughput
and
on
top
of
that
how
long
does
the
first
sheet
take
to
print
inkjets
are
faster
than
you
say
and
in
both
cases
the
computer
often
has
trouble
keeping
up
with
the
printer
i
have
a
and
a
lot
of
drivers
cannot
keep
up
with
the
printer
a
sage
said
to
me
do
you
want
one
copy
or
lots
of
copies
one
inkjet
something
else
to
think
about
is
the
cost
of
consumables
over
the
life
of
the
printer
a
page
yield
toner
cartridge
is
about
us
at
discount
while
hp
high
capacity
page
yield
cartridges
are
about
us
at
discount
it
could
be
that
over
the
life
cycle
of
the
printer
that
consumables
for
laser
printers
are
less
than
ink
jet
printers
it
is
getting
progressively
closer
between
the
two
technologies
laser
printers
are
usually
desinged
for
higher
duty
cycles
in
pages
per
month
and
longer
product
replacement
cycles
paper
cost
is
the
same
and
both
can
use
refills
long
term
the
laserprinter
will
need
some
expensive
replacement
parts
consumables
and
on
top
of
that
are
the
amortisation
costs
which
favour
the
lowest
purchase
cost
printer
hp
inkjets
understand
pcl
so
in
many
cases
a
laserjet
driver
will
work
if
the
software
package
has
no
inkjet
driver
there
is
one
wild
difference
between
the
two
printers
a
laserprinter
is
a
page
printer
whilst
an
inkjet
is
a
line
printer
this
means
that
a
laserprinter
can
rotate
graphic

whilst
an

the

i
cant

if

do
though
also
the

can
do

only
if
you
buy

oh

blinking

where
can
i
buy

besides
radio

does
anyone
sell
blinking

with

i
guess
if
so
what
hertz

are
they
adjustable

i
like
the

of
leds
with

already
in

i
hate

dont

re

i
think
a
few
things
are
being
missed
overall
here
first
of
all
anyone
with
a
dos
manual
can
copy
a
disk
or
copy
anything
hidden
files
dont
go
far
if
you
are
dealing
with
anyone
who
is
not
comletely
dos
ignorant
off
of
a
hard
disk
professional
crackers
arent
interested
in
copying
disks
they
are
programmers
who
get
some
thrill
out
of
going
through
unassembly
listings
of
programs
to
disable
copy
protection
such
as
serial
number
dialog
boxes
volume
label
checks
and
who
knows
what
when
it
comes
to
computer
games
those
people
are
in
the
minority
however
in
my
experience
with
the
world
of
people
and
software
it
seems
that
a
good
majority
of
people
say
will
at
some
point
copy
a
friends
program
gee
you
really
oughta
try
this
or
accept
a
copy
these
are
people
who
normally
would
buy
a
software
package
or
do
without
but
decided
that
just
once
it
wouldnt
matter
the
last
thing
is
people
who
own
or
are
responsible
for
more
than
one
computer
most
people
arent
going
to
spend
x
of
computers
for

they
will
just
install

are
the
boards
at
all
intelligent
ie
run
by
microcontrollers
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
have
another
line
that
says
that
one
of
the
boards
is
talking
to
the
pc
when
this
line
was
true
the
other
boards
could
all
hold
off
and
not
send
their
data
this
isnt
a
perfect
solution
though
since
you
have
to
worry
a
little
about
making
sure
two
boards
dont
decide
to
talk
at
the
exact
same
time
other
than
that
i
think
you
will
need
to
hook
up
each
board
to
something
that
speaks
this
actually
isnt
as
hard
or
as
expensive
as
it
used
to
be
though
assuming
the
boards
talk
relatively
slowly
bps
or
slower
the
pics
can
coordinate
things
between
themselves
to
multiplex
the
data
this
is
really
just
forbicly
adding
the
suggestion
in
the
first
paragraph
to
your
system
and
it
assumes
that
each
board
doesnt
talk
more
than
of
the
time
of
for
very
long
since
a
pic
isnt
going
to
be
able
to
buffer
more
than
maybe
bytes

might
want

two

the

also

what
my

is
when
laying

what

should
they
be
i
am

low

what
should
pad

be
for

i
will
be
turning
to
a

maker
to
produce
of
these

and
i
was
wondering
what
is
the

traces
should

any

lead

part
i
thought
the
first
thread
was
hilarious
so
here
goes
another
post
some
more
background
information
on
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
batteries
one
year
i
left
the
batteries
in
the
garage
the
garage
is
unheated
they
were
left
in
their
places
that
they
needed
to
be
one
in
the
riding
lawnmower
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycle
the
battery
in
the
riding
lawnmower
was
about
years
old
and
one
of
the
cycle
batteries
was
new
and
one
was
around
years
old
upon
spring
time
i
discovered
that
all
of
the
batteries
were
dead
and
needed
to
be
recharged
they
all
worked
properly
except
for
the
older
ones
and
they
had
to
be
replaced
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
originally
been
stored
in
the
garage
and
i
think
i
remember
my
dad
charging
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decided
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
has
two
parts
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concrete
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discovered
in
the
spring
about
days
ago
that
not
only
were
the
batteries
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmeter
read
around
in
other
words
it
was
pinned
the
internal
circut
tripped
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteries
they
were
the
same
realizing
that
we
still
had
gigantic
sailboat
batteries
also
lead
acid
i
decided
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sitting
for
around
and
a
half
years
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
noticed
that
they
only
needed
a
small
charge
around
hours
or
so
on
trickle
i
tested
them
by
using
them
at
the
local
gas
station
for
giving
jump
starts
and
they
worked
fine
for
around
of
em
this
leads
me
to
believe
one
of
several
things
i
bought
really
tty
batteries
last
year
sorta
true
the
concrete
has
something
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
the
batteries
there
was
enough
moisture
to
short
out
the
terminals
in
the
room
where
the
concrete
is
the
dirt
room
was
able
to
absorb
the
moisture
in
the
air
better
than
concrete
btw
i
can
almost
waterski

the
dirt
room

which
is

uh

why
is

when
you

the
temperature
of
your

unlike
that
of

is
determined
by
the
balance

youre
feeling
the
greater

is
kept
much
warmer

its

in
the

of

this
will
affect
how
quickly
it
comes
into
equilibrium
with
its
surroundings
if
it
started
out
not
in
equilibrium
with
them

wont
affect
the

we
did

washer
so
we
would
use
one
several
miles
from

on
more
than
one
occasion
after
washing
the
engine
it
would
not

would

i
would
put
a
plastic

around
it
to
try

minimize
this
around
the
spark

wires
etc
and
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
try
and
wipe
all
these
areas
down
with
a
dry

usual
solution
was
to
carry

when

wouldnt

to
spray
all

areas

it
would
then
start

definately

that
i
asked
a
professor
that
question
just
last
week
and
he
didnt
really
know
himself
since
pink
noise
is
believed
to
be
due
to
surface
states
say
the
surface
of
the
silicon
where
theres
a
lack
of
a
covalent
bond
that
act
as
traps
to
nearby
elecrons
and
since
this
happens
at
low
frequencies
because
at
high
frequencies
they
arent
able
to
trap
electrons
how
do
you
compensate
for
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
compensate
for
pink
noise
i
have
seen
the
pink
noise
feature
however
on
many
eqs
and
i
was
wondering
how
they
are
suppose
to
compensate
for
noise
when
pink
noise
is
not
due
to
man
made
noise
like
power
lines
crosstalks
coupling
etc
if
you
have
any

about

because
the

when
the

the

will
drop

you

will
solve

however
you

if

you
probably
need
to
have

have
a

see

your

is
erroneous
if
his

then
the
chance

with
the
exception
of
harmonic
television
interference
is
the
greatest
since
he

it

unfortunately
the
case
that
a

station
that

perfectly
legally
could
possibly
cause
intereference
to
a
piece
of
consumer
audio
or
tv
equipment
just
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
consumer
equipment
cut
corners
on

disadvantages
ink
used

i

it

now
down
to
the

carts
used

say
theyre
dated
for
only
months
but
i
dont
think
they
say
so
anymore
we
stick
to
a

we
use

unless
you

you
grab
the

and
smudge
it
all

as

if
you
want
slow

flash

adjustable
by

or
by
a
digitally
controlled

i
suggest
looking
at
a
oscillator
chip
they
cost
at
radio
shack
much
cheaper
in
quantity
at
quality
places
and
you
will
be
able
to
find
good
info
about
simple
circuits
in
a
oscialltor
notebook
i
think
forest
mims
has
one
at
radio
shack
youll
have
to
toy
with
resistorcapacitor
values
or
you
can
use
your
head
with
a
little
math
to
get
the
right
frequencies
any
engineer
worth
his
salt
can
make
a
osciallator
its
in

and
left
up
to
you
to
see
i
hate
doing

circuit
graphics
the

accurately
go
from

to

khz
i
think
about
the

recorder
gizmo
you
could
alter
a
stereo
tape
deck
to
use
one
channel
as
a
data
line
for
flashing
led
and
one
as
audio
line
for
voice
or
music
this
would
eliminate
a
lot
of
noise
the
data
line
is
probably
most
easily
done
by
some
kind
of
pll
or
bandpass
filter
using
just
an
opamp
the
chip
is
a
good
pll
and
not
hard
to
work
with
however
if
you
nothing
about
how
a
pll
works
i
suggest
you
dont
try
this
opamp
information
can
also
be
found
in
the
forest
mims
radio
shack
infobooklets
and
the
popular
opamp
is
a
snap
to
work
with
setting

and
bandpass

values
are
not

easy
so
i
would

the
method
firstmost
i
have
no

what
this
is
going
into
so
i
am
really
generalizing
as

if

i
suggest
you
breadboard
the

i
thought
the
first
thread
was
hilarious
so
here
goes
another
post
some
more
background
information
on
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
batteries
one
year
i
left
the
batteries
in
the
garage
the
garage
is
unheated
they
were
left
in
their
places
that
they
needed
to
be
one
in
the
riding
lawnmower
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycle
the
battery
in
the
riding
lawnmower
was
about
years
old
and
one
of
the
cycle
batteries
was
new
and
one
was
around
years
old
upon
spring
time
i
discovered
that
all
of
the
batteries
were
dead
and
needed
to
be
recharged
they
all
worked
properly
except
for
the
older
ones
and
they
had
to
be
replaced
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
originally
been
stored
in
the
garage
and
i
think
i
remember
my
dad
charging
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decided
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
has
two
parts
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concrete
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discovered
in
the
spring
about
days
ago
that
not
only
were
the
batteries
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmeter
read
around
in
other
words
it
was
pinned
the
internal
circut
tripped
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteries
they
were
the
same
realizing
that
we
still
had
gigantic
sailboat
batteries
also
lead
acid
i
decided
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sitting
for
around
and
a
half
years
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
noticed
that
they
only
needed
a
small
charge
around
hours
or
so
on
trickle
i
tested
them
by
using
them
at
the
local
gas
station
for
giving
jump
starts
and
they
worked
fine
for
around
of
em
this
leads
me
to
believe
one
of
several
things
i
bought
really
tty
batteries
last
year
sorta
true
the
concrete
has
something
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
the
batteries
there
was
enough
moisture
to
short
out
the
terminals
in
the
room
where
the
concrete
is
the
dirt
room
was
able
to
absorb
the
moisture
in
the
air
better
than
concrete
btw
i
can
almost
waterski
in
the
dirt
room
any
other
ideas
could
be
the
aliens
anything
is
possible
the
leadacid
secondary
cell
releases
energy
electricity
with
the
following
chemical
reaction
pb
lead
and
lead
iv
oxide
and
sulfuric
acid
produce
lead
sulfate
and
water
the
standard
heats
of
formation
at
c
f
of
the
various
compounds
are
heat
of
formation
compound
at
c
kcalmole
pb
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefore
kcal
per
mole
produced
note
that
lead
sulfate
is
not
very
soluble
grams
per
grams
water
at
c
and
it
will
thus
precipitate
out
of
solution
where
the
reaction
is
occurring
or
the
cathode
positive
terminal
of
the
battery
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
positive
terminal
where
the
precipitate
forms
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corroded
battery
to
corrobate
and
i
dont
feel
like
thinking
through
it
right
now
what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
that
the
reaction
as
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exothermic
or
energy
discharging
if
moisture
with
dissolved
electrolytes
acid
rain
condenses
on
the
battery
a
conductive
path
between
the
terminals
may
form
this
will
discharge
the
battery
as
the
chemical
reaction
proceeds
the
reaction
is
reversible
if
electricity
from
an
alternator
or
battery
charger
is
put
back
into
the
battery
leadacid
batteries
must
change
in
chemical
composition
to
discharge
each
cell
has
all
the
reactants
necessary
for
the
reaction
the
nonreacting
posts
terminals
of
the
leadacid
battery
are
there
to
remove
or
add
electric
energy
during
a
discharge
or
charge
because
the
reaction
is
exothermic
it
has
a
tendency
to
happen
though
quite
slowly
under
normal
circumstances
so
while
keeping
the
battery
dry
is
a
good
idea
it
is
not
a
total
solution
to
understand
why
leadacid
batteries
do
indeed
discharge
faster
when
stored
on
concrete
as
opposed
to
wood
or
earth
dirt
one
should
recall
lechateliers
principle
which
can
be
paraphrased
as
anything
subjected
to
some
stress
will
act
to
move
to
a
more
comfortable
position

also
c
is
about
k
and
the
values
for
earth
powder
are
on
the
same
order
of
magnitude
as
natural
earth
the
thermal
conductivity
of
concrete
is
around
a
factor
of
greater
than
that
of
dirt
and
is
times
greater
than
wood
it
is
these
differences
in
thermal
conductivity
that
cause
the
battery
on
concrete
to
discharge
faster
than
that
on
dirt
or
wood
at
any
instant
the
discharge
reaction
is
occurring
energy
is
being
released
either
as
electricity
or
heat
thermal
conductivity
of
air
is
about
btuhrftftfft
during
storage
except
for
the
trickle
that
passes
through
any
condensate
on
the
battery
this
energy
is
mostly
released
as
heat
the
higher
conductivity
surface
will
remove
the
heat
proportionately
faster
than
the
lower
conductivity
surface
thus
if
you
perfectly
insulated
a
dry
battery
on
all
but
the
bottom
surface
at
any
given
battery
temperature
above
the
storage
surface
temperature
the
battery
on
a
concrete
surface
will
be
discharging
about
times
faster
than
that
on
dirt
this
is
where
lechateliers
principle
comes
into
play
removing
energy
from
the
exothermic
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
completion
if
the
reaction
normally
occurs
at
room
temperature
keeping
the
battery
at
that
temperature
requires
the
removal
of
any
heat
produced
a
concrete
surface
is
a
better
heat
sink
than
a
dirt
or
wood
surface
store
a
battery
in
the
corner
of
a
poured
concrete
basement
and
you
have
surfaces
removing
energy
which
pulls
the
reaction
along
also
if
water
evaporates
from
the
battery
that
elevates
the
ratio
of
sulfuric
acid
to
water
this
will
tend
to
drive
the
discharge
reaction

there
is

you

with

maybe
maybe
not
today
it
doesnt
happen
as
often
i
would
hope
but
then
if
a
bios
is
buggy
and
the
user
gets
an
upgrade
the
bios
information
is
going
to
change
at
least
the
date
anyway
tagging
the
bios
manufacturer
is
still
going
to
falsely
tag
those
users
who
upgrade
the
motherboard
this
type
of
upgrade
doesnt
require
a

backuprestore
on
the

hand
to
make
this
less
intrusive
it
could
be
disguised
as
please
insert

as
i
need

yyyyyy
for

it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
sort
of
as
long
as
it
wasnt
done
too
terribly
often
otherwise
i
think
it
would
get
annoying
and
the
user
would
go
looking
for
other
software
this
is
silly
its
much
easier
to
loan
disks
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
install
than
to
backup
your

already
on

and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
going
to
stop
anyone
of
course
it
is
easier
are
you
saying
then
the
originals
should
allow
only
one
install
what
is
your
point
of
course
not
if
something
gets
corrupted
and
my
app
needs
to
be
reinstalled
the
worst
thing
i
want
that
software
telling
me
is
this
software
has
already
been
registered
to
blank
and
it
is
against
the
law
to
install
it
on
other
machines
or
something
similar
access
for
windows
does
this
and
it
only
requires
a
click
on
ok
to
go
away
pretty
nonintrusive
but
it
gets
the
point
across
what
i
said
was
the
program
should
have
certain
restriction
such
as
the
restricttoonemachine
until
the
program
is
registered
with
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
will
then
supply
the
thenprovenlegitimateuser
with
a
patch
that
will
disable
the
restriction
and
proudly
proclaim
the
legal
copy
with
the
registered

xxx
screen
this
is
a
great
idea
i
like
the
key
system
that
some
shareware
products
use
the
only
problem
is
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
big
software
companies
to
implement
this
without
it
getting
very
costineffective
for
them
and
more
of
a

than

scaling
being

right

i
was
wondering
what
the
best
way
to
scale
an
ac
voltage
using
an
digital
word
is
i
am
thinking
of
using
the
common
method
of
sending
the
word
through
an
adc
and
then
comparing
it
with
the
ac
voltage
converted
to
a
sawtooth
wave
to
get
a
duty
cycle
however
i
am
leary
of
this
method
because
it
a
requires
a
lot
of
parts
and
more
importantly
b
creates
a
lot
of
interference
from
the
switching
on
the
entire
ac
line
i
realize
that
correct
filtering
could
cancel
out
most
of
this
interference
but
that
would
require
more
parts
and
boost
the
price
further
someone
mentioned
to
me
that
they
had
seen
an
ic
which
input
bits
of
data
and
directly
scaled
the
ac
voltage
coming
in

unfortunately
he
couldnt
remember
the
chip
number
or
the
manufacturer
if
anyone
else
has
heard
of
this
chip
please
email
me
i
am
building
this
project
as
a
dimmer
box
for
a
light
controller
circuit
and
it
is
important
that
the
cost
of
each
box
remains
very
low
because
one
dimmer
is
required
for
each
light
that
the
user
wishes
to
control
well
each
channel
at
least
therefor
if
each
box
costs
i
doubt
that
an
end
user
will
want
to
dish
out
x
for
sixteen
channels
this
is
something
i
have
noticed
about
todays
dimmer
boxes
they
are
so
expensive
anyway
any
help
which
someone
could
offer
on
either
a
method
of
easily
doing
this

andy
for
the
most
part
silversolder
is
not
used
for
general
soldering
tasks
due
to
the
mechanism
of
dendritic
growth
silversolder
when
exposed
to
high
humidity
and
placed
in
an
electric
field
will
actually
grow
dendrites
which
are
conductive
and
will
adventually
electrically
short
across
closely
spaced
nodes
which
are
creating
the
field
for
this
reason
silver
is
allowed
only
in
hermetically
sealed
assemblies
fortunatly
tinlead
solder
is
quite
stable
and
will
not
grow
dendrites
as
fast
as
silversolder
therefore
it
is
used

i
did

find

last
longer
i
dont

suggest
contacting

that

depending
on
the

printer
and
the
level
to
which
you
wish
to
upgrade
i
upgraded
my
original
desket
to
a

the
kit
was
fairly
expensive
you
are
likely
better
off
selling
your
old
printer
and
purchasing
a
new
deskjet
now
that
prices
have
declined
so

fair
amount
of

contact

the
pcl
language
used
by
deskjets
is
considerably
different
from
the
pcl
used
by
laser
printers
especially
the
newer
laser
printers
the
biggest
problem
is
dumb
laser
drivers
that
send
a
raster
end
command
after
each
scan
line
this
makes
no
material
difference
for
lasers
but
causes
the
deskjet
to
print
the
accumulated
raster
as
you
might
guess
the
result
is
hideously
slow
printing
the
new
dos
wordperfect
print
deskjet
drivers
are
still
guilty
of
this
particular
behavior
from
the
way
wordperfect
works
this
would
not
be
easy
to
change
windows
wordperfect
works
efficiently
unless
you
use
the

the
dialect
used
in

laserjet
iiip
allows
compression
that
permits
a
full
page
dpi
image
to
be
rendered
with
only
one
megabyte
of
memory
an
uncompressed
image
could
be
as
large
as
about
kbytes
but
the
printer
needs
about
of
memory
for
its
internal
housekeeping
laserjet
iv
models
support
banded
printing
that
allows
incrmental
download
of
the
image
with
compression
in
limited
memory
situations
deskjet
downloadable
fonts
are
not
compatible
with
laserjet
fonts
a
single
page
from
a
laserjet
only
requires
about
seconds
this
is
faster
than
any
but
the
most
trivial
printing
from
a
deskjet
printer
the
presumption
of
course
being
that
the
laser
printer
has
completed
its
warmup
cyle
until
ink
chemistry
is
changed
wicking
resulting
in
image
deterioration
is
unavoidable
i
wont
use
the
word
impossible
but
matching
laser
quality
output
from
a
deskjet
printer
is
unlikely
chosing
an
appropriate
paper
type
helps
but
does
not
eliminate
the
problem
laser
printers
are
more
wastful
of
energy
and
consumable
components
hp
does
accept
return
of
spent
toner
cartridges
mitigating
the
material
waste
problem
to
a
degree
energy
waste

kyocera

the
image
drum
is
good
for
approximately
copies
it
is
a
very
nice
print
engine
i
wish
hp
used
the
kyocera
engine
kyocera

a
neat

source
and
stacker

the
recommended
duty

for

laser
printers
the
pickup
pressure
rollers
are
subject
to
wear
and
i
case
confirm
eventually
do
wear
out
the
usual
symptom
is
that
the
printer
becomes
reluctant
to
feed
paper
the
paper
feed
is
integrated
in
a
transport
mechanism
that
is
a
single
part
from
hp
service
replacement
cost
for
the
transport
is
almost
the
feed
rollers
are
not
separately
replacable
though
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
job
for
a
competent
technician
i
have
disassembled
and
reassembled
the
transport
on
my
own
printer
it
depends
upon
the
application
which
printer
is
best
for
you
if
you
only
print
or
pages
a
day
and
are
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of

the

is
a
very
good
choice
as
noted

is
there
a
technical
reason
or
could
it
be
that
the
marketing
geniuses
have
not
tought
about
it
yet
the
green
layer
is
a
soldermask
and
is
used
to
make
a
finished
board
look
neat
and
to
avoid
solder
bridges
especially
when
using
wave
soldering
or
any
other
mechanized
approach
ive
seen
red
mask
but
most
that
ive
seen
are
green
a
bakelite
board
will
look
brown
in
colour
and
if
the
solder
mask
is
put
on
looks
like
a
brown
board
with
green
paint
on
either
side
or
just
one
side
of
the
board
a
fibreglass
board
will
look
green
from
the
side
because
the
green
soldermask
makes
the
board
appear
that
colour
if
you
got
a
fibreglass
board

no

it
would
be
a

the

mask
was
green
so
theyre
not
about

i
didnt

did
i
i
hate

take
my

i

that
once
you
have
installed
it
you
cannot

transfer

the

what
you

you
gotta

right
what
happens

decide

no
that

then
you
would
better
make
pretty
sure
that
a
statement
to
that
effect
is
printed
loud
and
clear
on
the
package
a
better
way
to
implement
the
above
mentioned
scheme
is
imho
to
allow
anyone
to
install
the
program
but
if
they
register
they
get
some
additional

enabled
it
could
mean
only
one
new

needed
to
be
copied
to
have
got
the

anyone
is
free

that

at
whatever
time
they

still
we
face
the
trouble
of
moving
the

could
be

the

a

here
are
some

limit
the
size
of

that
the

can
work
with
disable
saving
the
data
print
it
out
with
some
defects
in
the
output
but
be
sure
to
mark
them
as
such
let

appear

going

be
stuck
obtaining
a

databooks
from
the

those
little
phonebooktype
books
that
are
obsoleted
every
couple
years
we
use
a
cdrom
based
system
here
there
are
about
cdrom
disks
and
a
changer
hooked
to
a
dedicated
msdos
computer
it
contains
scanned
images
of
data
book
pages
for
several
thousand
parts
when
you
ask
it
for
something
it
knows
about
mostly
active
ic
parts
it
works
quite
well
they
dont
handle
all
the
varieties
of
transistors
or
diodes
that
exist
it
is
definately
a
start
in
the
right
direction
but
they
need
to
expand
the
data
base
to
handle
more
types
of
stuff
these
systems
arent
cheap
we
paid
about
for
the
liscence
and
get
monthly
updates
of
some
of
the
cdrom
disks
we
send
the
old
ones
back
to
them
so
that
they
will
keep
sending
us
the
updates
i
think
we
pay
a
yearly
maintainence
fee
of
about
to
get
the
updates
if
you
find
the
part
you
want
you
can
look
at
the
data
sheet
on
a
pagesized
monitor
its
a
special
monitor
from
sigmasystems
you
can
also
print
each
page
of
the
datasheet
you
want
on
a
laserjet
printer
page
printing
takes
a
couple
of
minutes
per
page
it
can
take
a
while
to
dump
the
or
pages
you
usually
need
i
have
a
feeling
the
maker
wouldnt
like
it
if
we
made
the
data
available
to
all

re
lead
acid
batteries
part
the
leadacid
secondary
cell
releases
energy
electricity
with
the
following
chemical
reaction
pb
lead
and
lead
iv
oxide
and
sulfuric
acid
produce
lead
sulfate
and
water
heats
of
formation
deleted
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefore
kcal
per
mole
produced
note
that
lead
sulfate
is
not
very
soluble
grams
per
grams
water
at
c
and
it
will
thus
precipitate
out
of
solution
where
the
reaction
is
occurring
or
the
cathode
positive
terminal
of
the
battery
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
positive
terminal
where
the
precipitate
forms
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corroded
battery
to
corrobate
and
i
dont
feel
like
thinking
through
it
right
now
the
major
problem
with
this
is
that
the
reaction
takes
place
in
an
acid
solution
is
soluble
in
an
acid
solution
and
will
not
precipitate
out
also
is
in
a
water
solution
as
and
thus
the
heats
of
formation
of
and
are
for
the
most
part
irrelevant
what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
that
the
reaction
as
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exothermic
or
energy
discharging
as
it
turns
out
the
reaction
is
indeed
exothermic
heat
producing
more
about
this
later
what
actually
happens
to
make
the
battery
completely
useless
is
this
were
talking
leadacid
batteries
of
course
the
battery
slowly
self
discharges
as
this
discharge
takes
place
two
things
happen
the
level
of
pb
ions
in
the
acid
solution
increases
ie
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
are
dissolved
the
level
of
ions
in
the
acid
solution
decreases
ie
the
solution
becomes
less
acidic
or
more
like
water
if
you
like
now
as
the
post
to
which
i
am
responding
correctly
stated
will
precipitate
in
a
water
nonacid
solution
when
the
battery
dies
ie
is
fully
discharged
we
end
up
with
a
high
concentration
of
pb
and
in
water
so
forms
in
the
solution
and
falls
to
the
bottom
of
the
battery
of
course
this
happens
in
varying
degrees
the
more
discharged
the
more
precipitate
forms
the
precipitate
forms
a
conductive
layer
on
the
bottom
of
the
battery
if
there
is
enough
of
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
left
to
touch
the
precipitate
more
common
in
a
newer
battery
a
dead
short
results
i
have
seen
products
in
automotive
shops
to
correct
this
condition
but
they
are
for
the
most
part
useless
they
can
dissolve
the
but
cannot
restore
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
properly
you
may
have
some
success
with
these
products
for
a
newer
battery
stuff
deleted
to
understand
why
leadacid
batteries
do
indeed
discharge
faster
when
stored
on
concrete
as
opposed
to
wood
or
earth
dirt
one
should
recall
lechateliers
principle
which
can
be
paraphrased
as
anything
subjected
to
some
stress
will
act
to
move
to
a
more
comfortable
position
here
are
the
thermal
conductivities
of
a
some
selected
materials
stuff
deleted
this
is
where
lechateliers
principle
comes
into
play
removing
energy
from
the
exothermic
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
completion
if
the
reaction
normally
occurs
at
room
temperature
keeping
the
battery
at
that
temperature
requires
the
removal
of
any
heat
produced
a
concrete
surface
is
a
better
heat
sink
than
a
dirt
or
wood
surface
store
a
battery
in
the
corner
of
a
poured
concrete
basement
and
you
have
surfaces
removing
energy
which
pulls
the
reaction
along
this
stuff
is
just
made
up
by
the
author
and
is
completely
invalid
in
fact
the
discharge
reaction
takes
place
at
a
higher
rate
at
higher
temperatures
a
logical
consequence
of
the
above
argument
is
this
if
you
really
want
your
car
to
start
lower
the
battery
temperature
to
to
pull
the
reaction
along
we
all
know
from
experience
at
least
those
of
us
in
canada
do
it
gets
cold
up
here
that
this
is
not
true
if
we
want
to
start
our
car
on
a
really
cold
day
we
warm
the
battery
besides
which
there
is
not
enough
energy
released
through
self
discharge
to
appreciably
raise
the
temperature
the
air
would
amply
dissipate
any
such
heat
whether
the
bottom
of
the
battery
was
insulated
or
not
this
is
of
course
irrelevant
since
you
would
want
the
battery
to
be
cool
during
storage
just
keep
the
battery
in
a
cool
dry
place
and
keep
it
charged

i

i
notice
that
it

ever
read

barring

such

channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete

points
and
interpolates
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
understanding
in

you
care
the
filtering

uses
an

filter
id
guess
that
cd

use
the

kind
of
method
anybody
out

know
the
real

typical
in

was
a

fir
implemented
as
a

addition
circuit
at
this
kind
of

slow
by
digital

such
an

is
much
less
expensive
than
analog
components
of
comparable
precision
i
gleaned
this
information
from
a
hardware
manual
for
an
old

design
where
one
would
find
similar
info
for

the

is
an
interesting

from

i
have
no

the

read
a

you

try

if
neither

you

the

one
of
three

that
hp
made
many
years

the
others
were
the
low

oscillator
and
the
wide

oscillator
these
are
the
ones
with
the
diameter
chrome
dial
a
wein
bridge
circuit
that
used
pilot
lights
as
the
feedback
loop
and
firebottles
that
produced
many
volts

ive
just
acquired
a

the

needs

i
know
i
can
likely
buy
a

that
costs
and
considering
i
paid
a

does
anyone
have

rubbish
the
reason
for
the
colour
of
the
boards
depends
on
the
solder
the
may
cover
of
qst
has
a
picture
of
three
different
boards
without
any
solder
mask
you
can
tell
from
the
copper
colored
traces
the
box
labeled
transverter
has
the
brown
teflonglass
board
while
the
one
in
the
center
has
the
grayish
board
exposed
on
the
left
is
some
fiberglass
board
that
looks
green
to
me
i
see
no
reason
for
putting
solder
mask
on
circuit
board
used
for
box
covers
i
wonder
if
any
manufacturer
actually
puts
a
solder
mask
on
their
low
noise
microwave
preamps
often
microwave
circuits
have
odd
bits
of
wirefoilmetal
attached
to
whereverwhatever
is
necessary
to
make
the
unit
work
properly
this
is
a
commercial
product
a
solder
mask
would
certainly
make
doing
this
tougher
never
mind
the
finding
something
that
minimally
degrades
the
circuits
q
dope
for
coils
does
not
improve
the
qit
just
holds
things
together
with
minimal

the

pins

so
for

oh
the

were
rubberlike

were
floppy

about
thick

so
the

that
you
speak

are
el
electroluminescent

they
are
mostly
used

emit

true
white

are
the

that
ive
personally

at

if
i

correctly
you
can
get
them
to
work
at

but
they
dont
glow

they
will

you

to

up
again
we
let
it

i
doubt
that
methanol

significant

i
would
be
very
wary
of
not

because
it
is
dangerous
to
you
even
if
its

harm
the

not

is
it

i

its

you

have

uses
an

either
a

using
some

in

i
was
looking

a

was
advertised
taht
doesnt

to
use
any

at

does
anyone
know
what
the

for
this
would

then
i
could
just
adapt
it

alot

thanks
well
the
fastest
crudest
mixer
aside
from
just
physically
connecting
all
your
inputs
together
directly
is
to
run
each
signal
through
a
resistor
to
a
common
output
the
resistors
give
some
isolation
so
the
signal
sources
arent
driving
directly
into
each
other
taking
a
wild
seatofthepants
guess
id
say
that
if
you
are
mixing
highimpedance
sources
like
some
dynamic
mikes
electric
guitar
pickups

your
resistors
ought
to
be
maybe

glad
you
do
not

this
point
if

it

capacity
of

less
than

so
it
heats

conversely

cools

the

procedure
for

to

the

the

the

the

during

the

most
of

have

with

my
suspicion
is
that
i
dont
really
need
anything
larger
than
and
this
could
all
be
resolved
with
a
transformer
of
some
sort
nope
your
problem
is
either
being
caused
by
excessive
voltage
drop
in
the
long
cable
from
the
generator
or
just
plain
not
having
enough
power
i
would
suspect
that
those
amps
are
going
to
draw
a
lot
of
current
on
short
peaks
you
can
try
using
larger
and
shorter
cables
to
the
generator
or
try
strapping
the
amps
for
service
and
running
mains
cables
out
which
will
minimize
the
line
drop
if
these
dont
work
though
youre
going
to
need
a
bigger
generator
i
assume
that
youre
using
wellmaintained
generators
and
have
watched
the

properly
if
you
dont

advice

you

i

the
leadacid
secondary
cell
discharge
reaction
is
exothermic
i
am
glad
you
do
not
dispute
this
point
if
you
dont
want
the
lead
storage
battery
to
discharge
it
should
be
stored
such
that
its
charged
state
is
the
equilibrium
state
during
winter
the
ground
be
it
covered
with
concrete
dirt
or
wood
maintains
a
cooler
temperature
on
average
than
the
surrounding
air
or
the
battery
the
heat
capacity
of
air
is
less
than
that
of
concrete
dirt
or
wood
so
it
heats
faster
conversely
air
cools
faster
too
the
normal
storage
procedure
for
a
battery
is
to
leave
it
in
an
unheated
garage
or
basement
the
storage
surface
is
often
cooler
than
the
surrounding
air
with
the
battery
temperature
somewhere
inbetween
eg
the
basement
air
temperature
may
be
f
the
floor
temperature
f
and
the
battery
temperature
f
the
air
temperature
is
higher
than
the
battery
temperature
the
heat
of
reaction
is
not
going
to
move
up
the
gradient
the
floor
temperature
is
lower
than
the
battery
temperature
and
heat
is
going
to
move
to
it
the
floor
is
an
incredible
heat
sink
might
depend
on
where
you
live
i
know
locally
for
most
of
the
winter
the
ground
and
concrete
floor
within
sheds
and
garages
unheated
is
signifacantly
warmer
than
the
average
air
temperature
the
air
does
get
warmer
during
the
day
but
during
the
night
the
ground
and
concrete
is
definitely
warmer
especially
when
protected
by
the
walls
from
the
albedo
effect
and
the
nights
are
longer
by
several
hours
than
the
days

sorry
about
following
up
my
own
article
but
i
wanted
to
continue
that
what
might
be
being
missed
here
is
that
the
important
thing
might
not
be
temperature
differences
per
se
but
the
action
of
heat
sinking
the
battery
perhap
someone
could
conduct
an
experiment
taking
two
identical
lead
acid
batteries
placing
both
on
wooden
shelves
but
putting
one
of
them
in
a
water
bath
designed
to
act
as
a
heat
sink
this
would
eliminate
the
concrete
floor
effect
and
keep
both
batteries
at
the
same
ambient
temperature
i
think
the
argument
over
temperatures
is
not
pertinent
but
the
one
over
heat
conductance
and
removing
the
exothermic
heat
may
have
some
validity

rogers
he
details
methods
of
underground
and
underwater
wireless
communications
for
a
review
refer
to
electricalexperimenter
march
and
june
rogers
methods
were
used
extensively
during
the
world
war
and
was
unclassified
after
the
war
supposedly
the
government
rethought
this
soon
after
and
rogers
was
convieniently
forgotten
the
bottom
line
is
that
all
antennas
that
are
grounded
send
half
of
their
signal
thru
the
ground
the
half
that
travels
thru
space
is
quickly
dissapated
by
the
square
of
the
distance
but
that
which
travels
thru
the
ground
does
not
disapate
at
all
furthermore
the
published
data
showed
that
when
noise
drowned
out
regular
reception
the
underground
antennas
would
recieve
virtually
noisefree
if
you
find
this
hard
to
believe
then
refer
to
the
work
of
the
man
who
invented
wireless
tesla
tesla
confirmed
that
rogers
methods
were

wrote
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
put
together
a
tesla
circuit
which
was
published
in
an
electronics
magazine
and
could
have
been
the
circuit
which
is
referred
to
here
this
one
used
a
flyback
transformer
from
a
tv
onto
which
you
wound
your
own
primary
windings
it
also
used
power
transistors
in
a
to
years
ago
i
built
a
volt
tesla
and
the
thing
was
very
spectacular
but
besides
scaringamazing
friends
depending
on
their
knowledge
of
science
and
generating
strong
emi
i
never
found
anything
useful
that
could
be
done
with
it
is
there
any
realworld
application
for
tesla
coils
today
david
prutchi
first
of
all
realize
that
tesla
invented
ac
power
generators
motors
transformers
conductors
etc
technically
all
transformers
are
tesla
coils
in
general
though
when
someone
refers
to
a
tesla
coil
they
mean
an
air
core
resonant
transformer
the
tv
flyback
version
tesla
coil
see
the
encyclopediaofelectroniccircuits
for
diagram
has
not
an
air
core
it
is
of
a
class
of
circuit
called
oscillating
shuttle
circuit
osc
generally
oscs
are
highly
efficient
but
this
version
uses
transistors
and
resistors
which
are
very
lossy
devices
typically
tesla
used
active
reactances
instead
of
passive
resistors
so
that
he
could
achieve
efficiencies
of
and
better
the
usual
application
of
an
aircore
resonant
transformer
or
of
an
osc
is
to
produce
strong
emi
for
wireless
broadcasts
how
well
do
you
think
your
computer
screen
would
work
if
we
removed
the
hf
hv
tesla
flyback
coil
from
it
if
we
were
to
remove
from
our
homes
and
industries
all
tesla
coils
our
lights
would
go
dark
our
cars
would
sputter
and
die
our
radios
would
go
silent
our
industries
would
grind
to
a
halt
and
we
would
have
to
go
back
to
using
coal
for
heat
gas
for
lamps
horses
for
transportation
steam
for
power
and
telegraph
for
communication
is
that
real
world
enough
for
you
get
the
message
we
would
not
have
the
convieniences
we
have
today
if
not

actually
named

both
the

the

both

revolutionized

re

thanks
for
the
resposes
as
they
were
all
good
ideas
and
i
am
looking
at
using
a
couple
of
the
ideas
i
recieved
in
the
mail
today
the
spec
sheets
on
the
mil
spec
version
of
exars
timercounter
chip
it
is
stable
down
to
c
and
sucks
very
little
power
they
show
an
application
for
a
ultralong
time
delay
up
to
several
years
depending
on
the
rc
time
constant
in
this
application
they
have
two
of
them
cascaded
together
the
reset
and
trigger
pins
of
both
chips
are
tied
together
and
the
timebase
of
the
second
chip
is
disabled
in
this
configuration
the
output
is
high
when
the
system
is
reset
when
triggered
the
output
goes
low
and
stays
that
way
for
a
total
of
x
the
timing
cycle
of
the
first
chip
the
total
timing
cycle
of
the
two
chips
can
be
programmed
from
to
x
r
x
c
to
x
r
x
c
in
steps
by
selecting
any
combination
of
the
counter
outputs
to
the
timer
output
the
beauty
of
it
is
the
timebase
chip
would
only
have
to
have
a
timing
cap
and
a
resistor
for
seconds
per
timing
cycle
so
i
can
get
a
maximum
of
seconds
between
timing
cycles
x
or
about
days
of
course
thats
much
more
than
i
need
days
but
the
counter
allows
for
binary
steps
that
can
be
selected
for
the
output
for
the
pellet
puker
after
the
first
days
and
it
trips
it
would
reset
its
self
for
the
next
day
timing
cycle
and
so
forth
power
is
still
a
problem
though
a
few
ideas
that
you
suggested
was
to
bury
the
electronics
in
a
hole
dug
in
the
snow
as
an
insulator
and
put
the
pellet
puker
up
on
a
tower
above
the
estimated
snow
fall
with
a
solar
panel
on
it
to
keep
a
charge
on
a
lithium
battery
pack
i
like
that
idea
this
thing
has
to
work
for
at
least
six
weeks
for
three
samples
and
the
gas
valves
are
volts
to
spit
the
pellets
out
onto
the
snow
anyway
i
ordered
the

what
i
can
do
with
them

be

oh

one
analogue

give
you
or
me
at
least
a
fair
idea
of
whats
going
on
in

circuit
digital
scopes
seem
to
have
a
habit
of
inventing
a
sizable
part
of
it
eg
even
when
there
are
only
a
few
samples
per
period
our
displays
a
continuous
waveform
complete
with
nonexisting
overshoots
ive
waded
through
lots
of
manual
pages
and
menus
but
i
havent
found
yet
how
to
turn
this
off
it
doesnt
show
which
points
have
actually
been
measured
as
opposed
to
those
which
have
been
interpolated
either
perhaps
youre
using
the
wrong
brand
sorry
all
hp
fans
but
i
have
a
hard
time
being
convinced
that
their
scopes
match
the
rest
of
their
excellent
gear
one
of
the
principal
functions
i
look
for
when
considering
a
dso
is
whether
you
can
turn
interpolation
off
the
other
important
feature
is
to
disable
repetitive
waveform
acquisition
ie
being
able
to
lock
the
instrument
into
real
time
capture
mode
secondly
i
dont
like
menus
i
want
to
see
all
common
functions
with
their
own
button
youll
have
guessed
i
love
analogue
tek
scopes
id
choose
a
knob
with
printed
legend
over
an
onscreen
display
with
updown
buttons
right
away
the
single
knob
of
most
digital
instruments
never
seems
to
be
connected
to
the
right
function
at
the
right
moment
i
agree
with
you
here
the
only
consolation
is
that
manufacturers
are
beginning
to
pay
attention
to
ergonomics
when
designing
the
menus
however
to
be
fair
it
seems
that
first
time
scope
users
our
students
seem
to
adjust
to
menus
easier
than
navigating
around
the
twenty
or
more
knobs
required
of
a
real
scope
last
but
not
least
you
never
know
if
the
waveform
displayed
is
old
or
recent
noisy
or
just
incoherently
modulated
heck
you
dont
even
know
if
it
really
looks
the
way
its
displayed
digital
scopes
only
show
you
a
tiny
fraction
of
whats
going
on
most
of
the
time
there
busy
computing
things
this
is
one
area
that
newer
dsos
are
addressing
i
recently
evaluated
the
latest
box
from
tek
their
which
seems
to
be
a
worthy
alternative
to
a
standard
analogue
cro
this
instrument
has
a
spec
meaning
that
it
is
always
in
real
time
capture
mode
the
pricing
also
matches
equivalent
analogue
scopes
in
the
range
the
downer
is
that
the
instrument
uses
menus
again
but
at
least
they
appear
to
be
logically
laid
out
there
are
only
three
situations
for
which
i
would
prefer
a
digital
scope
looking
at
what
happened
before
the
trigger
looking
at
rare
events
and
acquiring
the
data
to
have
my
computer
play
with
it
lets
hope
scope
manufacturers
are
listening

one
more
thing
about
the
new
simpler
front
panels
these
instruments
tend
to
use
digital
rotary
encoders

this
is

vast
improvement
over
the
old
oak
switch
the
single
most
common
cause

failure

other
than

blowing

is
mechanical
wear

look
at

as

thier

that

good
ideas
thanks
in
advance
wes
firstly
i
would
never
consider
trying
to
make
a
oneshot
timer
your
cap
will
have
been
designed
as
a
ram
battery
substitute
rather
than
for
use
in
applications
where
you
wish
to
drain
the
cap
with
a
constant
current
their
performance
in
some
respects
is
more
akin
to
batteries
than
to
a
normal
cap
the
other
point
is
that
big
electros
are
usually
rated
with
tolerances
so
calculating
exactly
what
capacitance
you
have
particularly
when
considering
the
cold
you
should
be
looking
at
designing
a
micropower
oscillator
and
divider
chain
that
rolls
over
from
zero
to
maximum
count
or
viceversa
once
every
seconds
if
you
were
to
use
something
like
a
clock
you
would
need
a
divider
chain
of
to
give
an
error
of
less
than
one
percent
in
the
firing
times
over
the
six
week
period
of
course
you
could
trim
the
oscillator
to
give
you
exact
time
but
the
likelyhood
of
the
oscillator
remaining
exactly
constant
at
is
low
anyway
i
would
suspect
that
there
would
be
far
more
battrey
drain
in
firing
the
solenoid
than
there
would
be
in
the
timer
circuit
caveat
im
not
experienced
in
low
temperature
electronics
so
i
cant
guarantee
that
this
or
any
other
approach
is
the
best
for
inhospitable
conditions

ive
started
to

some

doing

fairly
decent

in
fairly

have
seen
a
variety
of
schemes
for
protecting
the
transceivers
and
the
rest
of
the

from

on

im

what
is
the

how

deleted
what
is
the
wisdom
on
this
out
there
ta
martin
from
what
i
know
protection
is
necessary
esp
if
you
plan
to
route
the
cables
into
an
unknown
environment
out
of
your
control
things
like
accidental
shorts
between
the
signal
lines
and
power
cables
or
even
lightning
strikes
are
very
likely
and
i
dont
think
you
like
to
see
the
sight
of
your
computer
going
up
in
smoke
even
ethernet
cards
are
protected
ive
looked
at
the
one
in
my
pc
and
the
connector
is
protected
by
a
gas
discharge
tube
but
if
you
plan
to
use
the
serial
cables
for
internal
routings
ie
in
controlled
environments
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
not
to
have
them
suggestion
look
in
the
rs
data
book
they
have
several
transceivers
that
have
overvoltage
protection
among
them
include
the
and
and
the
maxims
are
suppose
to
be
electrically
isolated
ones
but
still
need
optoisolators
to
work
dont
ask
me
why
ive
never
used
them
before
another
alternative
is

it
may
go

you
wont

you
probably
wont

it
will
sync

display
it
i
prefer
at

since

do

too
the

probably
goes

down

how
does

when

it
would

to
me
for

to
be

with

i
am
fairly
sure
this
isnt
the
case
so
whats
the
deal
essentially
this
is
actually
how
it
is
done
the
radar
gun
is
tied
into
the

of
the

no
it
is
independent
of
the

the

processes
two

check
out
what
the

used
to
say
about
selfmodifying

he
uses

rather

we

have
a

binary

word
hold
either
contain
full

number
equivalent
to

digits
but
we
will
use
the
first
binary
digit
to
denote
the
sign
or
two
binary
digit
orders
it
should
be
added
that
this
technique
of
automatic
substitutions
into
orders
ie
the
machines
ability
to
modify
its
own
orders
under
the
control
of
other
ones
among
its
orders
is
absolutely
necessary
for
a
flexible
code
thus
if
part
of
the
memory
is
used
as
a
function
table
then
looking
up
a
value
of
that
function
for
a
value
of
the
variable
which
is
obtained
in
the
course
of
the
computation
requires
that
the
machine
itself
should
modify
or
rather
make
up
the
reference
to
the
memory
in
the
order
which
controls
this
looking
up
and
the
machine
can
only
make
this
modification
after
it
has
already
calculated
the
value
of
the
variable
in
question
on
the
other
hand
this
ability
of
the
machine
to
modify
its
own
orders
is
one
of
the
things
which
makes
coding
the
nontrivial
operation
which
we
have
to

by

down
into

the

can
be
measured
as
they
come
to
the

the
problem
is
trying

build
a

that
would
stand

a

i
have
looked

the
standard

thier

fooling

a

power

use

contact

voltage
multiplier
problem
hi
ive
just
built
a

and
use
a
diodecapacitor
voltage
multiplier
to
step
the
supply
voltage
up
to
approx
as
the
load
resistance
increases
the
rc
constant
decreases
and
hence
the
output
voltage
drops
i
need
as
high
an
output
voltage
as
possible
about
the
circuit
consists
of
seven
voltage
multiplier
stages
ie
diodes
and
capacitors
each
capacitor
develops
about
across
them
and
i
take
the
output
from
across
seven
each
capacitor
is
at
if
i
increase
each
of
the
capacitors
rating
that
will
increase
the
rc
constant
and
hence
alleviate
some
of
the
problem
these
capacitors
are
going
to
be
a
little
expensive
as
i
need
of
them
so
what
would
happen
if
i
connected
a
at
capacitor
in
parallel
with
the
output
and
hence
in
parallel
with
the
seven
capacitors
will
it
as
i
assume
increase
the
c
in
circuit
and
hence
increase
the
rc
time
constant
if
it
does
and
my
output
voltage
becomes
more
stable
by
doing
this
then
i
will
have
killed
two
birds
with

stone
as
i
am

hence

this

are
digital
with
all
the
bells
and
whistles
including
softkeys
which
i
think
are
a
loveley
touch
that
is
software
keys
you
dont
forget
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
computer
those
scopes
even
with
all
their
neatness
still
make
the
ickyest
looking
waves
lotsa
features
but
ugly
output
and
those
are
the
best
digitals
i
have
ever
seen
ive
seen
a
lot
of
cheaper
digitals
and
they
look
terrible
i
think
the
hangup
with
digital
scopes
is
that
you
have
to
know
so
much
more
about
them
and
how
they
work
on
a
scopebyscope
basis
and
some
of
the
functions
are
typically
presented
in
my
opinion
in
a
counterintuitive
fashion
hp
has
made
some
strides
in
their
series
imo
automatic
setups
are
fine
for
simple
repetitive
waveforms
but
can
give
you
some
crazy
results
on
more
complex
events
where
you
need
to
understand
how
the
scope
is
actually
measuringprocessing
the
event
for
example
is
the
scope
in
equivalent
time
or
in
real
time
sampling
mode
equivalent
time
being
a
mode
where
samples
are
builtup
slowly
by
adding
a
delay
to
the
trigger
event
each
sweep
what
was
the
scopes
actual
sampling
rate
at
the
time
how
is
the
data
being
massaged
after
capture
but
before
display
etc
one
common
misconception
is
the
speed
of
the
scope
is
the
hp
scope
youre
using
really
a
mhz
scope
or
is
it
a
mhz
sample
rate
scope
mhz
single
shot
significance
whose
front
end
including
sh
can
support
mhz
waveforms
important
for
equivalent
time
sampling
the
mhz
input
in
this
case
really
only
helps
you
when
your
waveform
is
repetitive
or
on
a
single
sample
when
you
get
lucky
and
hit
a
transient
event
during
a
sample
time
so
there
are
a
lot
more
variables
in
understanding
how
to
get
useful
information
from
a
digital
scope
i
prefer
an
analog
scope
for
general
use
and
the
digital
for
events
where
i
need
storage
for
later
analysis
or
comparison
when
the
event
is
within
the
capability
of
the
scope
now
for
the
price
of
true
mhz

a

the

of

you

one
news

quoted
an

as

in

he

and
he
could
never

audio

telephone

have
the

of
to
the
reason
they
do

this
is
it
is
not

compatable

telephone
system

the
most
effecent
mix

electrical
effecency
and
intelegability
closly
mateches
a
passband
close
but
no
banana
to
paraphrase
garfield
the
reason
hz
is
used
is
that
voice
channels
used
to
occupy
bands
when
multiplexed
on
a
trunk
line
therefore
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
of
this
band
were
filtered
to
minimise
interference
with
the
next
band
nowadays
digital
trunks
have
made
this
less
relevant
but
the
phone
companies
still
see
no
reason
to
improve
quality
especially
for
free
therefore
digital
chunk
of
a
trunk
segments
still
have
a
guaranteed
bandwidth
of
only
so
they
can
carry
the
equivalent
of
one
analog
line
at
the
clock
rate
of
a
standard
pcm
or
digital
trunk
its
all
historical
here
in
the
uk
the
bandwidth
restriction
apparently
only
apply
to
local
lines
ie
those
used
by
the
average
domestic
client
private
lines
which
are
run
from
the
local
exchange
to
the
leasing
client
are
usually
capable
of
a
higher
bandwidth
if
the
exchange
is
digital
dont

me

joystick

measuring

by
michael

in

tech

it
talks
about
how
to
read
all
kinds
of

voltage
current
resistance
in
basic
and
even
includes
code
for
a
simple
oscilloscope
display
its
possible
to
read
the
joystick
port
directly
if
you
dont
want
to
use
basic
the
detailed
information
for
this
is
in
the
pc
technical
reference
under
options

you
have
to
provide

peltier

i
was
having
a
look
through
a
couple
of
components
catalogues
when
i
came
across
a
range
of
peltier
effect
heat
pumps
intended
for
cooling
components
for
those
who
have
not
heard
of
this
effect
you
put
a
current
through
one
of
these
devices
and
it
pumps
heat
from
one
side
to
the
other
reverse
the
current
and
you
reverse
the
effect
i
think
a
temperature
difference
can
give
you
an
emf
as
well
anyway
it
struck
me
that
you
could
make
a
nice
coolhot
box
for
picnics
with
one
of
these
a
power
regulator
a
thermostat
and
a
couple
of
heat
sinks
the
biggest
device
can
shift
with
an
efficiency
of
which
aint
bad
although
it
would
flatten
my
car
battery
in
about
half
an
hour
unfortunately
the
catalogue
didnt
list
anything
more
than
the
basic
specs
as
a
heat
pump
i
imagine
that
you
would
get
a
backemf
as
the
temperature
gradient
across
the
device
increases
if
so
presumably
its
power
decreases
as
the
backemf
increases
until
eventually
we
have
a
steady
state
with
no
current
being
consumed
assuming
no
leakage
if
so
then
the
final
temperature
difference
between
the
two
sides
could
be
set
by
the
supply
voltage
and
nothing
more
although
that
would
be
a
lousy
way
to
control
it
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
are
the
above
guesses
correct
what
is
the
opencircuit
thermal
resistance
of
a
typical
device
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
my

is
not
going

get
warm
too
fast
when
i

oh
brad
for
an
antenna
gain
is
synonymous
with
directionality
the
only
way
to
get
gain
out
of
an
antenna
is
to
design
in
directionality
the
gain
of
an
antenna
is
defined
as
the
signal
increase
for
a
preferred
direction
over
the
signal
obtained
by
an

that

somewhat
a
pain
to

what
i
am
looking
for
is
a
stable
ultralong
solid

timer
what
they
want
to
do
is
to
place
this
thing
on
the
antartic
ice
shelf
and
measure
the
amount
of
snow
fall
over
a
period
of
six
weeks
every
two
weeks
they
want
to
trip
a
selonoid
to
discharge
different
colored
pellets
by
gas
pressure
out
across
the
snow
then
by
digging
down
into
the
snow
the
snow
fall
amount
can
be
measured
as
they
come
to
the
different
color
pellets
the
problem
is
trying
to
build
a
timer
that
would
stand
the
cold
degrees
and
a
power
source
that
wouldnt
drain
i
have
looked
at
the
timers
and
the
standard
dual
timers
but
thier
temp
specs
wont
go
that
low
also
two
weeks
equates
to
seconds
per
firing
which
means
one
big
timing
cap
i
have
found
farad
yes
farad
caps
that
have
a
working
voltage
of
volts
and
are
small
in
size
but
again
the
time
of
discharge
at
or
lower
degrees
isnt
linear
i
was
thinking
of
using
several
timers
chained
together
to
fire
the
selonid
at
the
end
of
the
timing
period
but
that
blasted
cold
and
the
drain
on
a
battery
over
six
weeks
is
the
pain
one
possibility
would
be
to
use
solar
panels
but
this
is
during

anyone
have

just
a
suggestion
take
a
motorola
set
it
up
to
give
you
a
pulse
once
every
sec
or
ten
secs
with
either
a
rc
or
xtal
clock
input
then
feed
to
a
as
clock
input
and
decode
output
for
sec
output
might
have
to
add
a
few
and
gates
or
decoder
chips
to
get
output
and
reset
pulse
back
to
to
restart
cycle
trigger
a
oneshot
from
the
decoded
riseing
edge
the
one
shot
then
goes
to
a
mosfet
to
drive
the
mechanism
to
fire
the
pellet
launcher
these
ckts
require
uamps
of
currentbetween
volts
so
a
volt
gel
cell
of
a
few
amphours
would
last
the
six
weeks
then
take
the
ckt
board
battery
wrap
in

of
foam

build
a
box
of
out
of
the

plywood
or
metal
exterior
build
a
small
heater
out

in

use

what
i
understand
about

all
they

is
a
passive

much
like
the
radio
in
your

they
work
as
an
antenna
picking
up
that
radar
signals
that
the
radar
gun
sends
out
therefore
there
would
be
no
way
of
detecting
a
radar
detector
any
more
than
there
would
be
of
detecting
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
unfortunately
youre
wrong
on
both
counts
the
most
common
method
of
implementing
a
tunable
receiver
is
to
have
a
local
oscillator
the
local
oscillators
frequency
can
be
radiated
out
of
the
receiver
via
the
antenna
unless
the
circuit
is
designed

constructed
with

from
what
i
understand
about
radar
dectectors
all
they
are
is
a
passive
device
much
like
the
radio
in
your
car
they
work
as
an
antenna
picking
up
that
radar
signals
that
the
radar
gun
sends
out
therefore
there
would
be
no
way
of
detecting
a
radar
detector
any
more
than
there
would
be
of
detecting
whether
some
one
had
a
radio
in
their
car
from
my
rather
rusty
knowledge
of
radio
most
radio
receivers
use
a
superhet
circuit
so
that
the
incoming
signal
is
mixed
with
a
local
oscillator
giving
a
fixed
intermediate
frequency
if
that
is
more
easily
amplified
the
detector
detectors
work
by
picking
up
if
reradiated
from
your
radar
detector
in

they
had
a

solenoid
antennae
on

and
i
believe
could
triangulate
an
operating
tv
from
the
if
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
if
is
radiated
back
from
the
detector
antenna
and
how
much
from
the
rest
of
the

it
might
be

when

have
the

of
applying

it

the

notes
to
summarize
this

has
so

stated

the
only
area
where
holes
are

is
the
vacuum
that
is
hole
particles
only
exist
in

previous
threads
have
stated
that
holes
only
exist
in
certain
semiconductors
the
question
that
naturally
arises
is
if
the
hole
currents
inside
a
semiconductor
vanish
at
the
point
where
the
semiconductor
is
joined
to
a
conductor
say
copper
i
dont
want
a
theoretical
discussion
here
about
whether
holes
could
exist

the

wont

pp

of

have

signals

way
less

have

impedances
in

the
thing
is

i

reasonable

i
am

in

with
the

i
could

there
i

like
to
have
this

not
be
active
any
quick
ideas
the

not
broken
for
other
reasons
i
had
sent
it
to
the

to
get
repaired
and
they
replaced
it
the

generator
was
the
same
way
on

one
too
please
help

less

flashes

it

you
typed

this

in

its
where
i
got
the

from

modeled

one

quit

opened

the

had
simply
melted
some
of

attaching
it

i
soldered
them

theres

it

why
not
do

then
thered
be
no

we

you
may

several

are
the
old
two
prong
type
without

naturally
the

feeding

is
without

i

at

that
some

have

with

and
that
on
these

the
ground
wire
was
tied
to
the
same
bus
as
the
neutral
white
wire
this
is
contrary
to
the
electrical
code
and
should
be
fixed
well
my
house
was
built
just
last
year
and
the
breaker
box
is
wired
the
same
way
there
should
be
a
connection
of
the
ground
wire
to
a
ground
in
the
breaker
box
there
also
should
be
a
connection
of
the
neutral
wire
to
a
ground
in
the
breaker
box
there
should
be
no
other
place
in
the
building
where
such
a
connection
occurs
ie
not
in
any
of
the
outlet
boxes
the
neutral
white
wire
is
a
grounding
conductor
for
the
plug
and
is
not
safe
to
touch
while
the
ground
green
wire
is
a
protective
ground
and
carries
no
current
unless
some
kind
of
electrical
fault
has
occurred
its
safe
to
touch
the
protective
ground
but
not
to
touch
the
grounding
conductor
because
there
is
current
in
the
grounding
conductor
its
outletbox
end
will
not
be
at
the
same
ground
potential
as

theres
a
good
idea
all
you
need
is
amps
dc
for
a
few
minutes
and
a
good
wetware
memory
was
i
using
wp
or
autocad
or
i
thought
of
the
same
idea
myself
a
few
days
ago
ive
got
a
fairly
new
car
battery
that
i
take
along
in
my
when
i
go
camping
and
it
sits
around
useless
when
im
home
i
wish
i
could
get
a
batteryless
ups
to
use
it
with
or
use
it
with
a
heavy
duty
regulator
to
supply
the
pc
but
i
guess
youd
need
and
and
too
more
batteries
an
alternative
would
be
to
leave
a
amp
battery
charger
hooked
up
to
the
battery
and
run
a
to
converter
running
all
the
time
and
when
the
power
goes
out
voila
the
converter
keeps
on
running
off
the
battery
and
then
i
could
take
the
converter
and
my
computer
on
the
camping

guys
whats

anyone
seen
this
before
what
is
happening
is
this
you
turn
the
tv
on
the
horizontal
output
begins
normal
operation
this
powers
up
the
high
voltage
and
most
of
the
rest
of
the
circuitry
a
problem
is
sensed
and
the
horizontal
oscillator
shuts
down
after
it
powers
down
the
cycle
repeats
things
to
check
first
check
for
a
shorted
high
power
component
your
best
bet
is
the
vertical
output
transistors
or
if
there
is
one
the
voltage
regulator
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
failure
is
too
much
current
being
drawn
somewhere
also
look
for
shutdown
circuits
which
your
tv
may
or
may
not
have
if
you
can
find
one
that
is
shutting
down
the
horizontal

then
it
shouldnt
be

what
do

suppose
abc

its

pretty
good

that
they
wont

any

they
also
can
obtain
just

you
want

they

flashed

that

thought
the

the

even
capable
of

was
of

ordered

installed
instead
of
bringing

another

bundle
the

just
connected
up
to
my

so
i
have
one
line
on
red
green

the
other
on

black
today
i
was
monitoring
the
voltage
on
both

i
had
a

across
the
red

green
and
read
back
volts
i
then
lifted
up
the

on
my

the

dropped
to

it
also
dropped

next
i
went

just
a

of
mine
here
since
an

it
usually
drops
below
how
about
an
led
in
series
with
a
zener
say
around
onhook
led
on
offhook
led
off
would
this
work
if
anyone
triestried
it
please
let
me
know
aye
theres
the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
the
equipment
at
the
phone
company
will
think
youve
gone
off
hook
in
the
onhook
state
youre
not
supposed
to
draw
current
which
means
you
should
just
use
your
digital
voltmeter
you
can
use
an
old
vom
but
the
phone
company
equipment
can
detect
that
and
might
think
theres
something
wrong
with
the
cable
look
guys
whats
the
problem
here
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
off
hook
all
you
need
it
to
run
it
in
series
with
the
line
as
i
mentioned
in
my
previous
post
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
on
hook
all
you
need
is
a
voltage
threshold
detector
if
youre
going
to
do
the
series
diode
thing
which
is
the
easiest
just
make
sure
that
the
led
can
take
the
current
i
cant
recall
it
offhand
but
its
something
like
or
more
careful
now
folks
also
consider
the
that
is
forced
on
ring
and
tip
when
the
phones
supposed
to
ring
even
with
a
simple
zener
and
led
setup
you
might
end
up
with
some
carbon
real
quick
whatever
scheme
you
use
make
sure
youve
got
at
least
components
on
the
frontend
also
remember
that
if
im
not
mistaken
the
phone
line
is
a
equivalent
circuit
any
current
you
draw
from
the
or
so
gets
dropped
across
that
thats
fine
until
youre
down
to
roughly
when
ma
bell
considers
it
to
be
offhook
but
dropping
it
that
far
down
is
probably
a
big
nono
the
easiest
implementation
to
accomplish
the
above
tip
rectifier
resistor
diode
v
zener
resistor
v
led
ring
this
is
only
a
suggestiongo
ahead
and
blow
holes
in
it
but
you
get
the
idea
choose
a
highefficiency
led
so
you
dont
need
much
current
to
get
it
to
light
up
choose
values
for
the
other

im
no
expert
at
upss
but
you
said
something
that
made
it
sound
like
you
didnt
realize
something
on
a
typical
ups
well
on
ours
anyway
there
is
no
switchover
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protected
equipment
is
always
running
from
the
batteries
via
an
inverter
with
the
usual
condition
of
also
having
them
on
charge
if
the
power
fails
big
deal
the
computers
never
see
it
until
the
batteries
start
to
droop
but
theres
something
like
carsized
batteries
in
that
cabinet
so
it
takes
a
while
if
you
were
gonna
run
the
guts
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
inverter
why
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
thered
be
no
switchover
to
screw
things
up
and
no
having
to
sense
the
failure
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charge
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need
it
actually
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
thati
sounds
to
me
your
ups
takes
in
ac
rectifies
it
to
dc
to
charge
the
batteries
and
then
takes
the
battery
dc
and
chops
it
to
ac
again
feeding
your
equipment
this
approach
is
the
easiest
and
cleanest
way
to
switchover
from
the
mains
to
battery
once
your
power
kicks
out
since
as
you
mentioned
nothing
will
know
about
what
happened
down
the
line
another
way
to
do
the
ups
scheme
is
to
use
the
mains
until
you
lose
power
and
then
kick
in
the
battery
backup
with
its
inverter
to
replace
the
lost
power
the
problem
here
is
the
switchover
time
and
youve
got
to
resync
the
ac
in
no
time
flat
unfortunately
most
everything
is
built
around
the
assumption
that
ac
is
available
so
the
ups
guys
have
to
provide
and
ac
output
to
be
usableya

have

itll

it
costs

the

was

small

the

it
created
burning

checked

the

wasnt

anything

oh
luckily
i
had
a

had

i

needless

first
it

secondly
the

the

shouldnt
be

only
during
a
fault
condition
the
reason
the
neutral

ground
are
tied
together
in
the
panel
is
the
tranformer
on
the
power
pole
has
a
grounded
centertap
secondary
with
the
grounded

the
neutral
this
gives
to
neutralground
from
each
side
of

across

in

the

whats

here
no
no
nooo
the
ground
green
wire
is
for
safety
no
current
is
supposed
to
flow
in
it
under
normal
conditions
this
means
that
theres
normally
no
voltage
drop
in
it
either
it
is
supposed
to
be
safe
to
touch
the
ground
wire
even
if
youre
grounded
in
some
other
way
at
the
same
time
the
neutral
white
wire
is
as
dave
vanderbyl
correctly
said
the
return
for
the
hot
wire
since
current
flows
in
it
theres
a
voltage
drop
if
you
plug
a
heavy
load
into
a
properlywired
grounded
outlet
you
can
commonly
measure
a
volt
or
so
of
difference
between
neutral
and
ground
they
are
supposed
to
be
connected
together
at
the
breaker
panel
but
nowhere
repeat
nowhere
else
well
almost
there
are
strange
exceptions
for
things
like
subpanels
what
you
can
do
if
you
want
threeprong
outlets
without
additional
wiring
is
to
use
a
gfci
outlet
or
breaker
but
the
outlet
will
be
cheaper
in
fact
depending
on
where
you
are
putting
your
new

a

may

required

there
are
a

the
skills
and
knows
the
tricks
of
the
trade
to
do
a
fast
safe
job
in
this
faq
weve
consciously
given
a
few
recommendations
that
are
in
excess
of
code
because
we
feel
that
its
reasonable
and
will
impress
the
inspector
the
inspector
will
know
that
youre
an
amateur
you
have
to
earn
his
trust
the
best
way
of
doing
this
is
to
spend
your
time
doing
as
neat
a
job
as
possible
dont
cut
corners
exceed
specifications
otherwise
the
inspector
may
get
extremely
picky
and
fault
you
on
the
slightest
transgressions
dont
try
to
hide
anything
from
the
inspector
use
the
proper
tools
ie
dont
use
a
bread
knife
to
strip
wires
or
twist
wires
with
your
fingers
the
inspector
wont
like
it
and
the
results
wont
be
that
safe
and
it
takes
longer
and
youre
more
likely
to
stick
a
hunk
of
wire
through
your
hand
that
way
dont
handle
house
wire
when
its
very
cold
eg
below
or
thermoplastic
house
wire
particularly
older
types
become
very
brittle
subject
what
do
i
need
in
the
way
of
tools
first
theres
the
obvious
a
hammer
a
drill
a
few
screwdrivers
both
straight
and
phillipshead
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
live
in
canada
or
find
a
source
of
csaapproved
devices
you
need
robertson
square
recess
screwdrivers
and
instead
of
phillips
for
drilling
a
few
holes
a
or
spade
bit
and
or
electric
drill
will
do
if
youre
doing
a
lot
or
are
working
with
elderly
lumber
we
recommend
a
drill
rightangle
drills
are
wonderful
can
be
rented
and
or
screwpoint
auger
drill
bits
these
bits
pull
you
through
so
theyre
much
faster
and
less
fatiguing
even
in
year
old
hardwood
timbers
screwdriver
bits
are
useful
for
drills
expecially
if
you
install
your
electrical
boxes
using
screws
drywall
screws
work
well
for
stripping
wire
use
a
real
wire
stripper
not
a
knife
or
ordinary
wire
cutters
dont
buy
the
kmart
combo
stripper
crimper
and
bottle
opener
types
you
should
expect
to
pay
to
for
a
good
pliertype
pair
it
will
have
sized
stripping
holes
and
wont
nick
or
grab
the
wire
it
should
be
easy
to
strip
wire
with
it
one
model
has
a
small
hole
in
the
blade
for
forming
exact
wire
loops
for
screw
terminals
there
are
fancier
types
autostripcut
but
they
generally
arent
necessary
and
pros
usually
dont
use
them
a
pair
of
diagonal
side
cutter
pliers
are
useful
for
clipping
ends
in
constricted
places
dont
use
these
for
stripping
wire
you
will
need
linesman
pliers
for
twisting
wires
for
wire
nuts
you
should
have
a
pair
of
needlenose
pliers
for
fiddling
inside
boxes
and
closing
loops
but
its
better
to
form
wire
loops
with
a
loop
former
hole
on
your
wire
stripper
more
accurate
if
youre
using
nonmetallic
cable
get
a
cable
stripper
for
removing
the
sheath
or
do
what
some
pros
do
they
nick
the
end
of
the
sheath
grab
the
ground
wire
with
a
pair
of
pliers
and
simply
rip
the
sheath
back
using
the
ground
wire
as
a
zipper
and
cut
the
sheath
off
you
shouldnt
try
to
strip
the
sheath
with
a
knife
point
because
its
too
easy
to
slash
the
insulation
on
the
conductors
apparently
stanley
utility
knives
fitted
with
linoleum
cutters
hooked
blades
can
be
used
to
strip
sheath
but
there
is
still
the
possibility
that
youll
gouge
the
conductors
for
any
substantial
amount
of
work
with
armored
cable
its
well
worth
your
while
to
invest
in
a
rotary
cable
splitter
us
hack
saws
are
tricky
to
use
without
cutting
into
the
wire
or
the
insulation
threeprong
outlet
testers
are
a
quick
check
for
properlywired
outlets
about
multimeters
tell
you
more
but
are
a
lot
more
expensive
and
probably
not
worth
it
for
most
people
a
simple
voltage
sensor
which
can
detect
potential
through
an
insulated
wire
not
supplying
any
devices
is
extremely
helpful
they
cost
about
us
at
radio
shack
you
should
have
a
voltage
detector
to
check
that
the
wires
are
dead
before
doing
work
on
them
neonbulb
version
are
cheap
and
work
well
if
you
get
more
serious
a
audible
alarm
type
is
good
for
tracing
circuits
without
a
helper
though
ive
been
known
to
lock
the
drill
on
and
hit
breakers
until
the
scream
stops
for
running
wires
through
existing
walls
you
need
fish
tape
often
two
tapes
are
needed
though
sometimes
a
bent
hanger
or
a
length
of
thin
chain
will
suffice
fish
tapes
can
be
rented
electrical
tape
lots
of
it
seriously
a
good
and
competent
wiring
job
will
need
very
little
tape
the
tape
is
useful
for
wrapping
dicy
insulation
in
repair
work
another
use
is
to
wrap
around
the
body
of
outlets
and
switches
to
cover
the
termination
screws
i
dont
do
this
but
drywall
contractors
prefer
it
to
prevent
explosions
when
the
drywall
knife
collides
with
a
live
outlet
that
has
no
cover
plate
subject
what
is
ul
listing
the
ul
stands
for
underwriters
laboratory
it
used
to
be
an
insurance
industry
organization
but
now
it
is
independent
and
nonprofit
it
tests
electrical
components
and
equipment
for
potential
hazards
when
something
is
ullisted
that
means
that
the
ul
has
tested
the
device
and
it
meets
their
requirements
for
safety
ie
fire
or
shock
hazard
it
doesnt
necessarily
mean
that
the
device
actually
does
what
its
supposed
to
just
that
it
probably
wont
kill
you
the
ul
does
not
have
power
of
law
in
the
us
you
are
permitted
to
buy
and
install
nonullisted
devices
however
insurance
policies
sometimes
have
clauses
in
them
that
will
limit
their
liability
in
case
of
a
claim
made
in
response
to
the
failure
of
a
nonullisted
device
furthermore
in
many
situations
the
nec
will
require
that
a
wiring
component
used
for
a
specific
purpose
is
ullisted
for
that
purpose
indirectly
this
means
that
certain
parts
of
your
wiring
must
be
ullisted
before
an
inspector
will
approve
it
andor
occupancy
permits
issued
subject
what
is
csa
approval
every
electrical
device
or
component
must
be
certified
by
the
canadian
standards
association
before
it
can
be
sold
in
canada
implicit
in
this
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
done
with
csaapproved
materials
they
perform
testing
similar
to
the
ul
a
bit
more
stringent
except
that
csa
approval
is
required
by
law
again
like
the
ul
if
a
fire
was
caused
by
noncsaapproved
equipment
your
insurance
company
may
not
have
to
pay
the
claim
in
canada
there
is
a
branch
organization
of
the
ul
called
ulc
ul
of
canada
ulc
does
not
have
power
of
law
and
seems
to
be
more
a
liason
group
between
the
csa
and
insurance
companies
subject
are
there
any

try
to
make
sure
that
the
book
is
based
on
the
latest
nec
revision
which
is
currently
canada
ps
knight
authors
and
publishes
a
book
called
electrical
code
simplified
there
appears
to
be
a
version
published
specific
to
each
province
and
is
very
tied
into
the
appropriate
provincial
code
it
focuses
on
residential
wiring
and
is
indispensible
for
canadian
diyers
it
is
better
to
get
this
book
than
the
cec
unless
you
do
a
lot
of
wiring
or
answer
questions
on
the
net
it
is
updated
each
time
the
provincial
codes
are
this
book
is
available
at
all
diy
and
hardware
stores
for
less
than
subject
inspections
how
and
what
why
should
i
get
my
wiring
inspected
most
jurisdictions
require
that
you
obtain
a
permit
and
inspections
of
any
wiring
that
is
done
amongst
other
more
mundane
bureaucratic
reasons
like
insurance
companies
not
liking
to
have
to
pay
claims
a
permit
and
inspections
provides
some
assurance
that
you
your
family
your
neighbors
or
subsequent
owners
of
your
home
dont
get
killed
or
lose
their
homes
one
night
due
to
a
sloppy
wiring
job
most
jurisdictions
have
the
power
to
order
you
to
vacate
your
home
or
order
you
to
tear
out
any
wiring
done
without
a
permit
california
for
instance
is
particularly
nasty
about
this
if
fire
starts
in
your
home
and
uninspected
wiring
is
at
fault
insurance
companies
will
often
refuse
to
pay
the
damage
claims
in
general
the
process
goes
like
this
you
apply
to
your
local
inspections
office
or
building
department
for
a
permit
you
should
have
a
sketch
or
detailed
drawing
of
what
you
plan
on
doing
this
is
a
good
time
to
ask
questions
on
any
things
youre
not
sure
of
if
youre
doing
major
work
they
may
impose
special
conditions
on
you
require
loading
calculations
and
ask
other
questions
at
this
point
they
will
tell
you
which
inspections
you
will
need
if
youre
installing
a
main
panel
you
will
need
to
have
the
panel
and
service
connections
inspected
before
your
power
utility
will
provide
a
connection
this
is
sometimes
done
by
the
local
power
authority
rather
than
the
usual
inspectors
after
installing
the
boxes
and
wiring
but
before
the
insulationwalls
go
up
you
will
need
a
roughin
inspection
after
the
walls
are
up
and
the
wiring
is
complete
you
will
need
a
final
inspection
subject
my
house
doesnt
meet
some
of
these
rules
and
regulations
do
i
have
to
upgrade
in
general
there
is
no
requirement
to
upgrade
older
dwellings
though
there
are
some
exceptions
ie
smoke
detectors
in
some
cases
however
any
new
work
must
be
done
according
to
the
latest
electrical
code
also
if
you
do
major
work
you
may
be
required
to
upgrade
certain
existing
portions
or
all
of
your
system
check
with
your
local
electrical
inspector
subject
a
word
on
voltages
one
thing
where
things
might
get
a
bit
confusing
is
the
different
numbers
people
bandy
about
for
the
voltage
of
a
circuit
one
person
might
talk
about
another
or
another
these
are
all
in
fact
exactly
the
same
thing
in
north
america
the
utility
companies
are
required
to
supply
a
splitphase
volt
feed
to
your
house
this
works
out
as
two
legs
additionally
since
there
are
resistive
voltage
drops
in
the
house
wiring
its
not
unreasonable
to
find
has
dropped
to
or
has
dropped
to
by
the
time
the
power
reaches
a
wall
outlet
especially
at
the
end
of
an
extension
cord
or
long
circuit
run
for
a
number
of
reasons
some
historical
some
simple
personal
orneryness
different
people
choose
call
them
by
slightly
different
numbers
this
faq
has
chosen
to
be
consistent
with
calling
them
and
except
when
actually
saying
what
the
measured
voltage
will
be
confusing
a
bit
just
ignore
it
one
thing
that
might
make
this
a
little
more
understandable
is
that
the
nameplates
on
equipment
ofen
show
the
lower
ie
instead
of
value
what
this
implies
is
that
the
device
is
designed
to
operate
properly
when
the
voltage
drops
that
low
is
not
the
same
as
is
the
voltage
between
phases
of
a
y
circuit
that
is
from
neutral
to
any
hot
is
the
voltage
between
phases
of
a
y
circuit
thats
from
hot
to
neutral
in
keeping
with
versus
strangeness
motors
intended
to
run
on
three
phase
are
often
labelled
as
subject
what
does
an
electrical
service
look
like
there
are
logically
four
wires
involved
with
supplying
the
main
panel
with
power
three
of
them
will
come
from
the
utility
pole
and
a
fourth
bare
wire
comes
from
elsewhere
the
bare
wire
is
connected
to
one
or
more
long
metal
bars
pounded
into
the
ground
or
to
a
wire
buried
in
the
foundation
or
sometimes
to
the
water
supply
pipe
has
to
be
metal
continuous
to
where
the
main
water
pipe
entering
the
house
watch
out
for
galvanic
action
conductivity
breaks
often
between
copper
and
iron
pipe
this
is
the
grounding
conductor
it
is
there
to
make
sure
that
the
third
prong
on
your
outlets
is
connected
to
ground
this
wire
normally
carries
no
current
one
of
the
other
wires
will
be
white
or
black
with
white
or
yellow
stripes
or
sometimes

furthermore
there

some

require

still
one

adding
additional

electrodes
connected

wiring
is
unsafe
and
contrary
to

if
you
add
a

the

usually
brought
as
separate
conductors
from

are
not

however
in
some
situations
certain
categories
of
separate
buildings
you
actually
do
have
to
provide
a
second

consult
your
inspector
the
other
two

will
usually
be
black
and
are
the
hot
wires
they
are
attached
to
the
distribution
transformer
as
well
the
two
black
wires
are
degrees
out
of

with

if
you
connect
something
to
both
hot

the

will
be
volts
if
you
connect

and
either
of
the

you
will
get
some
panels
seem
to
only
have
three
wires
coming
into
them
this
is
either
because
the
neutral
and
ground
are
connected
together
at
a
different
point
eg
the
meter
or
pole
and
one
wire
is
doing

note
in
the

the
nec
frequently
permits
a
circuit
similar
to
be
used
for
stoves
and
dryers
namely
that
there
are
two
hot
wires
and
a
wire
that
does
dual
duty
as
neutral
and
ground
and
is
connected
to
the
frame
as
well
as
providing
the
neutral

when

prong

are
required
in
our
notsohumble
opinion
this
is
crazy
but
the
nfpa
claims
that
this
practice
was
reevaluated
for
the
nec
and
found
to
be
safe
check
your
local
codes
or
inquire
as
to
local
practice
there
are
restrictions
on
when
this
is
permissible
is
usually
wired
with
three
conductor

have
one
hot
wire
coloured
red
the
other
black
a
bare

for
grounding
and
in
a

wire
for

you
will
sometimes
see
wired
with
just
a
black
white
and
ground
wire
since
the
white
is
hot
in
this
case
both
the
nec
and
cec
requires
that
the
white
wire
be
permanently
marked
at
the
ends
to
indicate
that
it
is
a
live
wire
usually
done
with
paint
nail
polish
or
sometimes
electrical
tape
each
circuit
is
attached
to
the
main
wires
coming
into
the
panel
through
a
circuit
breaker
or
fuse
there
are
in
a
few
locales
circuits
that
look
like
or
except
that
they
have

some
places
require
this
for

subject
grounding
versus
grounded
versus
neutral
according
to
the
terminology
in
the
cec
and
nec
the
grounding
conductor
is
for
the
safety
ground
ie
the
green
or
bare
wire
the
word
neutral
is
reserved
for
the
white
when
you
have
a
circuit
with
more
than
one
hot
wire
since
the
white
wire
is
connected
to
neutral
and
the
grounding
conductor
inside
the
panel
the
proper
term
is
grounded
conductor
however
the
potential
confusion
between
grounded
conductor
and
grounding
conductor
can
lead
to
potentially
lethal
mistakes
you
should
never
use
the
bare
wire
as
a
grounded
conductor
or
white
wire
as
the
grounding
conductor
even
though
they
are
connected
together
in
the
panel
but
not
in
subpanels
subpanels
are
fed
neutral
and
ground
separately
from
the
main
panel
usually
in
the
trade
and
in
common
usage
the
word
neutral
is
used
for
grounded
conductor
this
faq
uses
neutral
simply
to
avoid
potential
confusion
we
recommend
that
you
use
neutral
too
thus
the
white
wire
is
always
except
in
some
light
switch
applications
neutral
not
ground
subject
what
does
a
fuse
or
breaker
do
what
are
the
differences
fuses
and
circuit
breakers
are
designed
to
interrupt
the
power
to
a
circuit
when
the
current
flow
exceeds
safe
levels
for
example
if
your
toaster
shorts
out
a
fuse
or
breaker
should
trip
protecting
the
wiring
in
the
walls
from
melting
as
such
fuses
and
breakers
are
primarily
intended
to
protect
the
wiring
ul
or
csa
approval
supposedly
indicates
that
the
equipment
itself
wont
cause
a
fire
fuses
contain
a
narrow
strip
of
metal
which
is
designed
to
melt
safely
when
the
current
exceeds
the
rated
value
thereby
interrupting
the
power
to
the
circuit
fuses
trip
relatively
fast
which
can
sometimes
be
a
problem
with
motors
which
have
large
startup
current
surges
for
motor
circuits
you
can
use
a
timedelay
fuse
one
brand
is
fusetron
which
will
avoid
tripping
on
momentary
overloads
a
fusetron
looks
like
a
springloaded
fuse
a
fuse
can
only
trip
once
then
it
must
be
replaced
breakers
are
fairly
complicated
mechanical
devices
they
usually
consist
of
one
spring
loaded
contact
which
is
latched
into
position
against
another
contact
when
the
current
flow
through
the
device
exceeds
the
rated
value
a
bimetallic
strip
heats
up
and
bends
by
bending
it
trips
the
latch
and
the
spring
pulls
the
contacts
apart
circuit
breakers
behave
similarly
to
fusetrons
that
is
they
tend
to
take
longer
to
trip
at
moderate
overloads
than
ordinary
fuses
with
high
overloads
they
trip
quickly
breakers
can
be
reset
a
finite
number
of
times
each
time
they
trip
or
are
thrown
when
the
circuit
is
in
use
some
arcing
takes
place
which
damages
the
contacts
thus
breakers
should
not
be
used
in
place
of
switches
unless
they
are
specially
listed
for
the
purpose
neither
fuses
nor
breakers
limit
the
current
per
se
a
dead
short
on
a
circuit
can
cause
hundreds
or
sometimes
even
thousands
of
amperes
to
flow
for
a
short
period
of
time
which
can
often
cause
severe
damage
subject
breakers
cant
i
use
fuses
statistics
show
that
fuse
panels
have
a
significantly
higher
risk
of
causing
a
fire
than
breaker
panels
this
is
usually
due
to
the
fuse
being
loosely
screwed
in
or
the
contacts
corroding
and
heating
up
over
time
or
the
wrong
size
fuse
being
installed
or
the
proverbial
replace
the
fuse
with
a
penny
trick
since
breakers
are
more
permanently
installed
and
have
better
connection
mechanisms
the
risk
of
fire
is
considerably
less
fuses
are
prone
to
explode
under
extremely
high
overload

a

many
jurisdictions
particularly
in

no
longer
permit

panels
in
new

the

does
permit

some
rare
circumstances
requiring
the
special

fuses
some
devices
notably
certain
large
air
conditioners
require
fuse
protection
in

to
the
breaker

the
fuse
is
there
to
protect
the

getting
very

where
do
these
numbers
come
from
there
are
two
considerations
voltage
drop
and
heat
buildup
the
smaller
the
wire
is
the
higher
the
resistance
is
when
the
resistance
is
higher
the
wire
heats
up
more
and
there
is
more
voltage
drop
in
the
wiring
the
former
is
why
you
need
highertemperature
insulation
andor
bigger
wires
for
use
in
conduit
the
latter
is
why
you
should
use
larger
wire
for
long
runs
neither
effect
is
very
significant
over
very
short
distances
there
are
some
very
specific
exceptions
where
use
of
smaller
wire
is
allowed
the
obvious
one
is
the
line
cord
on
most

dont
try
this
unless

of
those
exceptions

youll
usually
use

in
essence
you
strip
the

about

twist
them

then
twist
the

though
some
wirenuts
advertise
that
you
dont

do
it
anyways
its
more
mechanically
and
electrically
secure
there
are
many
different
sizes
of

you
should
check
that
the
wire

youre

is
the
correct

youre
connecting

dont
just
gimble
the

with

or
your

use
a
pair
of
blunt

linesman

carefully
twist

sometimes
its
a
good
idea
to
trim
the

make
sure
it
goes
in

properly
some
people
wrap
the

with
electrical
tape
this
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
the
inspector
may
tear
it
off
during
an
inspection
its
usually
done
because
a
bit
of
bare

is
exposed

the
current
current
flowing
through
the
hot
wire
and
the
neutral
wire
if
they
differ
by
more
than
a
few
milliamps
the
presumption
is
that
current
is
leaking
to
ground
via
some
other
path
this
may
be
because
of
a
short
circuit
to
the
chassis
of
an
appliance
or
to
the
ground
lead
or
through
a
person
any
of
these
situations
is
hazardous
so
the
gfci
trips
breaking
the
circuit
gfcis
do
not
protect
against
all
kinds
of
electric
shocks
if
for
example
you
simultaneously
touched
the
hot
and
neutral
leads
of
a
circuit
and
no
part
of
you
was
grounded
a
gfci
wouldnt
help
all
of
the
current
that
passed
from
the
hot
lead
into
you
would
return
via
the
neutral
lead
keeping
the
gfci
happy
the
two
pairs
of
connections
on
a
gfci
outlet
are
not
symmetric
one
is
labeled
load
the
other
line
the
incoming
power
feed
must
be
connected
to
the
line
side
or
the
outlet
will
not
be
protected
the
load
side
can
be
used
to
protect
all
devices
downstream
from
it
thus
a
whole
string
of
outlets
can
be
covered
by
a
single
gfci
outlet
subject
where
should
gfcis
be
used
the
nec
mandates
gfcis
for

single

outlets
in
bathrooms

within

the
sink

unfinished
basements
or
crawl
spaces
outdoors
near

are

those
dedicated
to

typically
refrigerators

for

the

there
is
no

where

gfcis
are
generally
not

dont
pose

b
are
used
to
power
equipment
that
must
run
unattended
for
long
periods
of
time
refrigerators
freezers
and
sump
pumps
are
good
examples
the
rationale
is
that
gfcis
are
sometimes
prone
to
nuisance
trips
some
people
claim
that
the
inductive
delay
in
motor
windings
can
cause
a
momentary
current
imbalance
tripping
the
gfci
note
though
that
most
gfci
trips
are
real
if
youre
getting
a
lot
of
trips
for
no
apparent
reason
youd
be
welladvised
to
check
your
wiring
before
deciding
that
the
gfci
is
broken
or
useless
subject
what
is
the
difference
between
a
gfci
outlet
and
a
gfci
breaker
for
most
situations
you
can
use
either
a
gfci
outlet
as
the
first
device
on
the
circuit
or
you
can
install
a
breaker
with
a
builtin
gfci
the
former
is
generally
preferred
since
gfci
breakers
are
quite
expensive
for
example
an
ordinary
ge
breaker
costs
the
gfci
model
costs
there
is
one
major
exception
if
you
need
to
protect
a
multiwire
branch
circuit
two
or
more
circuits
sharing
a
common
neutral
wire
such
as
a
canadianstyle
kitchen
circuit
youll
need
a
multipole
gfci
breaker
unfortunately
these
are
expensive
the
cost
can
range
into
the
hundreds
of
dollars
depending
on
what
brand
of
panel
box
you
have
but
if
you
must
protect
such
a
circuit
say
for
a
pool
heater
you
have
no
choice
one
more
caveat
gfci
outlets
are
bulky
you
may
want
to
use
an
oversize
box
when
installing
them
on
second
thought
use
large
actually
deep
boxes
everywhere
youll
thank
yourself
for
it
incidentally
if
youre
installing
a
gfci
to
ensure
that
one
specific
outlet
is
protected
such
as
a
bathroom
you
dont
really
have
to
go
to
all
of
the
trouble
to
find
the
first
outlet
in
the
circuit
you
could
simply
find
the

anything
upstream
of

but
protecting
the
whole
circuit
is
preferred
when
you
install
a
gfci
its
a
good
idea
to
use
the
little
ground
fault
protected
stickers
that
come
with
it
and
mark
the
outlets
downstream
of
the

you
can
figure
out
which
outlets
are
downstream
simply
by
tripping
the
gfci
with
the
test
button
and
see
which
outlets
are
dead

whats
the
purpose
of
the
ground
prong
on
an
outlet
then
apart
from
their
use
in
electronics
which
we
wont
comment
on
and
for
certain
fluorescent
lights
they
wont
turn
on
without
a
good
ground
connection
theyre
intended
to
guard
against
insulation
failures
within
the
device
generally
the
case
of
the
appliance
is
connected
to
the
ground
lead
if
theres
an
insulation
failure
that
shorts
the
hot
lead
to
the
case
the
ground
lead
conducts
the
electricity
away
safely
and
possibly
trips
the
circuit
breaker
in
the
process
if
the
case
is
not
grounded
and
such
a
short
occurs
the
case
is
live
and
if
you
touch
it
while
youre
grounded
youll
get
zapped
of
course
if
the
circuit
is
gfciprotected
it
will
be
a
very
tiny
zap

is
why
you
can
use

there
are
some
appliances
that
should
never

consider
if

nothing
will
happen
if

will
be

high

if
the

be
the

subject
why
is
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
polarization
nowadays
many
twoprong
devices
have
one
prong
wider
than
the
other
this
is
so
that
the
device
could
rely
not
guaranteed
on
one
specific
wire
being
neutral

the
other
hot

is
particularly
advantageous

this
requires
that
you
wire

is
simple
with

the

us
plastic

dont
use

the

slightly
different
the

however
you
must
still

the

also
requires

on

the
advantage
of
plastic

is
comparatively
minor
even
for

you
can
avoid

on

plastic

light
fixture
in
general
one
can
replace
fixtures
freely
subject
to
a
few
caveats
first
of
course
one
should
check
the
amperage
rating
of
the
circuit
if
your
heart
is
set
on
installing
half
a
dozen
watt
floodlights
you
may
need
to
run
a
new
wire
back
to
the
panel
box
but
there
are
some
more
subtle
constraints
as
well
for
example
older
house
wiring
doesnt
have
hightemperature
insulation
the
excess
heat
generated
by
a
ceilingmounted
lamp
can
and
will
cause
the
insulation
to
deteriorate
and
crack
with
obvious
bad
results
some
newer
fixtures
are
specifically
marked
for
high
temperature
wire
only
you
may
find
in
fact
that
your
ceiling
wiring
already
has
this
problem
in
which
case
replacing
any
devices
is
a
real
adventure
other
concerns
include
providing
a
suitable
ground
for
some
fluorescent
fixtures
and
making
sure
that
the
ceiling
box
and
its
mounting
are
strong
enough
to
support
the
weight
of
a
heavy
chandelier
or
ceiling
fan
you
may
need
to
install
a
new
box
specifically
listed
for
this
purpose
a
across
the
ceiling
joists
makes
a
good
support
metal
brackets
are
also
available
that
can
be
fished
into
ceilings
thru
the
junction
box
hole
and
mounted
between
the
joists
there
are
special
rules
for
recessed
light
fixtures
such
as
pot
lamps
or
heat
lamps
when
these
are
installed
in
insulated
ceilings
they
can
present
a
very
substantial
fire
hazard
the
cec
provides
for
the
installation
of
pot
lamps
in
insulated
ceilings
provided
that
the
fixture
is
boxed
in
a
coffin
usually
made
by
making
a
pair
of
joists
high
and
covering
with
plywood
that
doesnt
have
any
insulation
yes
thats
feet
long
nec
rules
are
somewhat
less
stringent
they
require
at
least
clearance
between
the
fixture
and
any
sort
of
thermal
insulation
the
rules
also
say
that
one
should
not
obstruct
free
air
movement
which
means
that
a
cecstyle
coffin
might
be
worthwhile
presumably
thats
up
to
the
local
inspector
the
cec
doesnt
actually
mandate
the
coffin
perse
this
seems
to
be
an
inspector
requirement
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
the
fixture
cant
get
accidentally
buried
in
insulation
ie
if
you
have
insulation
blown
in
later
there
are
now
fixtures
that
contain
integral
thermal
cutouts
and
fairly
large
cases
that
can
be
buried
directly
in
insulation
they
are
usually
limited
to
watt
bulbs
and
are
unfortunately
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
older
types
before
you
use
them
you
should
ensure
that
they
have
explicit
ul
or
csa
approval
for
such
uses
follow
the
installation
instructions
carefully
the
prescribed
location
for
the
sensor
can
vary
there

not
yet
appear

fixture
that

the
coffin
appears
the
only
legal
approach
subject
what
does
it
mean
when
the
lights
brighten
when
a
motor
starts
this
usually
means
that
the
neutral
wire
in
the
panel
is
loose
depending
on
the
load
balance
one
hot
wire
may
end
up
being
more
than

the
other
less
than
with
respect
to
ground
this
is
a
very
hazardous
situation
it
can
destroy
your
electronic
equipment
possibly
start
fires
and
in
some
situations
electrocute
you
ie
some
us
jurisdictions
require
the
stove
frame
connected
to
neutral
if
this
happens
contact
your
electrical
authority
immediately
and
have
them
come
and
check
out
the
problem
note
a
brief
second
brightening
is
sometimes
normal
with
lighting
and
motors
on
the
same
with
neutral
circuit
a
loose
main
panel
neutral
will
usually
show
increased
brightness
far
longer
than
one
second

case
of

get

what
is

three
phase
power
has
three
hot
wires
degrees
out
of
phase
with
each
other
these
are
usually
used
for
large
motors
because
it
is
more
efficient
provides
a
bit
more
starting
torque
and
because
the
motors
are
simpler
and
hence
cheaper
youre
most
likely
to
encounter
a
phase
circuit
that
shows
volts
between
any
hot
and
ground
and
volts
between
any
two
hots
the
latter
shows
the
difference
between
a
normal
common
neutral
circuit
which
is
volts
between
the
two
hots
there
are
phase
circuits
with
different
voltages
bringing
in
a
phase
feed
to
your
house
is
usually
ridiculously
expensive
or
impossible
if
the
equipment
you
want
to
run
has
a
standard
motor
mount
it
is
much
cheaper
to
buy
a
new
or
motor
for
it
in
some
cases
it
is
possible
to
run
phase
equipment
on
ordinary
power
if
you
have
a
capacitor
start
unit
or
use
a
larger
motor
as
a
autogenerator
these
are
tricky
but
are
a
good
solution
if
the
motor
is
nonstandard
size
or
too
expensive
or
too
big
to
replace
the
taunton
press
book
the
small
shop
has
an
article
on
how
to
do
this
if
you
must
note
that
you
lose
any
possible
electrical
efficiency
by
using
such
a
converter
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
guarantee
that
subject
is
it
better
to
run
motors
at
or
theoretically
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
however
there
is
a
difference
is
the
amount
of
power
lost
in
the
supply
wiring
all
things
being
equal
a
motor
will
lose
times
less
power
in
the
house
wiring
than
a
motor
this
also
means
that
the
startup
surge
loss
will
be
less
and
the
motor
will
get
to
speed
quicker
and
in
some
circumstances
the
smaller
power
loss
will
lead
to
longer
motor
life
this
is
usually
irrelevant
unless
the
supply
wires
are
more
than
feet
long
subject
what
is
this
nonsense
about

it
is
a
universal
physical
law
that

is
equal
to
watts
given
heating
loss
power
factor
and
other
inefficiencies
it
is
usually
best
to
consider
hp
is
going
to
need
watts
a
circuit
can
only
deliver
watts
to
a
motor
so
it
cannot
possibly
be
more
than
approximately
hp
given
rational
efficiency
factors
is
more
like
it
some
equipment
manufacturers
sears
in
particular
most
router
manufacturers
in
general
advertise
a
hp
rating
that
is
far
in
excess
of
what
is
possible
they
are
giving
you
a
stall
horsepower
or
similar
that
means
the
power
is
measured
when
the
motor
is
just
about
to
stop
turning
because
of
the
load
what
they
dont
mention
is
that
if
you
kept
it
in
that
condition
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
hopefully
your
breaker
will
trip
otherwise
the
motor
will
melt
its
drawing
far
more
current
than
it
can
continuously
when
comparing
motors
compare
the
continuous
horsepower
this
should
be
on
the
motor
nameplate
if
you
cant
find
that
figure
check
the
amperage
rating
which
is
always
present
subject
how
do
i
convert
two
prong
receptacles
to
three
prong
older
homes
frequently
have
twoprong
receptacles
instead
of
the
more
modern
three
these
receptacles
have
no
safety
ground
and
the
cabling
usually
has
no
ground
wire
neither
the
nec
or
cec
permits
installing
new
prong
receptacles
anymore
there
are
several
different
approaches
to
solving
this
if
the
wiring
is
done
through
conduit
or
bx
and
the
conduit
is
continuous
back
to
the
panel
you
can
connect
the
third
prong
of
a
new
receptacle
to
the
receptacle
box
nec
mainly
cec
frowns
on
this
practise
if
there
is
a
copper
cold
water
pipe
going
nearby
and
its
continuous
to
the
main
house
ground
point
you
can
run
a
conductor
to
it
from
the
third
prong
run
a
ground
conductor
back
to
the
main
panel
easiest
install
a
gfci
receptacle
the
ground
lug
should
not
be
connected
to
anything
but
the
gfci
protection
itself
will
serve
instead
the
gfci
will
also
protect
downstream
possibly
also
two
prong
outlets
if
you
do
this
to
protect
downstream
outlets
the
grounds
must
not
be
connected
together
since
it
wouldnt
be
connected
to
a
real
ground
a
wiring
fault
could
energize
the
cases
of
prong
devices
connected
to
other
outlets
be
sure
though
that
there
arent
indirect
ground
plug
connections
such
as
via
the
sheath
on
bx
cable
the
cec
permits
you
to
replace
a
two
prong
receptacle
with
a
three
prong
if
you
fill
the
u
ground
with
a
nonconducting
goop
like
caulking
compound
this
is
not
permitted
in
the
nec
subject
are
you
sure
about
gfcis
and
ungrounded
outlets
should
the
test
button
work
were
sure
about
what
the
nec
and
cec
say
remember
though
that
your
local
codes
may
vary
as
for
the
test
button
theres
a
resistor
connecting
the
load
side
of
the
hot
wire
to
the
line
side
of
the
neutral
wire
when
you
press
the
test
button
current
through
this
resistor
shows
up
as
an
imbalance
and
trips
the
gfci
this
is
a
simple
passive
and
reliable
test
and
doesnt
require
a
real
ground
to
work
if
your
gfci
does
not
trip
when
you
press
the
test
button
it
is
very
probably
defective
or
miswired
again
if
the
test
button
doesnt
work
somethings
broken
and
potentially
dangerous
the
problem
should
be
corrected
immediately
the
instructions
that
come
with
some
gfcis
specify
that
the
ground
wire
must
be
connected
we
do
not
know
why
they
say
this
the
causes
may
be
as
mundane
as
an
old
instruction
sheet
or
with
the
formalities
of
ul
or
csa
listing
perhaps
the
device
was
never
tested
without
the
ground
wire
being
connected
on
the
other
hand
ul
or
csa
approval
should
only
have
been
granted
if
the
device
behaves
properly
in
all
listed
applications
including
ungrounded
outlet
replacement
one
of
us
called
leviton
their
gfcis
are
labeled
for
installation
on
grounded
circuits
only
the
technician
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
agreed
that
the
nec
does
not
require
it
and
promised
to
investigate
subject
how
should
i
wire
my
shop
as
with
any
other
kind
of
wiring
you
need
enough
power
for
all
devices
that
will
be
on
simultaneously
the
code
specifies
that
you
should
stay
under
of
the
nominal
capacity
of
the
circuit
for
typical
home
shop
use
this
means
one
circuit
for
the
major
power
tools
and
possibly
one
for
a
dust
collector
or
shop
vac
use
at
least
gauge
wire
many
power
tools
have
big
motors
with
a
big
startup
surge
if
you
can
use
amp
breakers
nec
though
cec
requires
standard
receptacles
which
means
youd
have
to
replug
all
your
equipment
lights
should
either
be
on
a
circuit
of
their
own
and
not
shared
with
circuits
in
the
rest
of
the
house
or
be
on
at
least
two
separate
circuits
the
idea
is
that
you
want
to
avoid
a
situation
where
a
blade
is
still
spinning
at
several
thousand
rpm
while
youre
groping
in
the
dark
for
the
off
switch
do
install
lots
of
outlets
its
easier
to
install
them
in
the
beginning
when
you
dont
have
to
cut
into
an
existing
cable
its
useful
if
at
least
two
circuits
are
accessible
at
each
point
so
you
can
run
a
shop
vac
or
a
compressor
at
the
same
time
as
the
tool
you
really
want
but
use
metal
boxes
and
plates
and
maybe
even
metalsheathed
cable
you
may
have
objects
flying
around
at
high
speeds
if
something
goes
a
bit
wrong
note
that
some
jurisdictions
have
a
no
horizontal
wiring
rule
in
workshops
or
other
unfinished
areas
that
are
used
for
working
what
this
means
is
that
all
wiring
must
be
run
along
structural
members
ie
stapled
to
studs
other
possible
shop
circuits
include
heater
circuits
circuits
for
some
large
tools
and
air
compressor
circuits
dont
overload
circuits
and
dont
use
extension
cords
if
you
can
help
it
unless
theyre
rated
for
high
currents
a
coiled
extension
cord
is
not
as
safe
as
a
straight
length
of
wire
of
the
same
gauge
also
the
insulation
wont
withstand
as
much
heat
and
heat
dissipation
is
the
critical
issue
if
your
shop
is
located
at
some
remove
from
your
main
panel
you
should
probably
install
a
subpanel
and
derive
your
shop
wiring
from
it
if
you
have
young
children
you
may
want
to
equip
this
panel
with
a
cutoff
switch
and
possibly
a
lock
if
you
want
to
install
individual
switches
to
safe
particular
circuits
make
sure
you
get
ones
rated
high
enough
for
example
ordinary
light
switches
are
not
safely
able
to
handle
the
startup
surge
generated
by
a
table
saw
buy
horsepowerrated
switches
instead
finally
note
that
most
home
shops
are
in
garages
or
unfinished
basements
hence
the
nec
requirements
for
gfcis
apply
and
even
if
you
know
that
youd
never
use
one
of
your
shop
outlets
to
run
a
lawn
mower
the
next
owner
of
your
house
might
have
a
different
idea
note
fine
woodworking
magazine
often
carries
articles
on
shop
wiring
april
is
one
place
to
start
subject
underground
wiring
you
will
need
to
prepare
a
trench
to
specifications
use
special
wire
protect
the
wire
with
conduit
or
special
plastic
tubing
and
possibly
lumber
dont
use
creosoted
lumber
it
rots
thermoplastic
insulation
and
acts
as
a
catalyst
in
the
corrosion
of
lead
the
transition
from
inhouse
to
underground
wire
is
generally
via
conduit
all
outdoor
boxes
must
be
specifically
listed
for
the
purpose
and
contain
the
appropriate
gaskets
fittings
etc
if
the
location
of
the
box
is
subject
to
immersion
in
water
a
more
serious
style
of
waterproof
box
is
needed
and
of
course
dont
forget
the
gfcis
the
required
depths
and
other
details
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
so
we
suggest
you
consult
your
inspector
about
your
specific
situation
a
hint
buy
a
roll
of
bright
yellow
tape
that
says
buried
power
line
and
bury
it
a
few
inches
above
where
the
wire
has
been
placed
subject
aluminum
wiring
during
the
aluminum
instead
of
copper
wiring
became
quite
popular
and
was
extensively
used
since
that
time
aluminum
wiring
has
been
implicated
in
a
number
of
house
fires
and
most
jurisdictions
no
longer
permit
it
in
new
installations
we
recommend
even
if
youre
allowed
to
that
do
not
use
it
for
new
wiring
but
dont
panic
if
your
house
has
aluminum
wiring
aluminum
wiring
when
properly
installed
can
be
just
as
safe
as
copper
aluminum
wiring
is
however
very
unforgiving
of
improper
installation
we
will
cover
a
bit
of
the
theory
behind
potential
problems
and
what
you
can
do
to
make
your
wiring
safe
the
main
problem
with
aluminum
wiring
is
a
phenomenon
known
as
cold
creep
when
aluminum
wiring
warms
up
it
expands
when
it
cools
down
it
contracts
unlike
copper
when
aluminum
goes
through
a
number
of
warmcool
cycles
it
loses
a
bit
of
tightness
each
time
to
make
the
problem
worse
aluminum
oxidises
or
corrodes
when
in
contact
with
certain
types
of
metal
so
the
resistance
of
the
connection
goes
up
which
causes
it
to
heat
up
and
corrode
oxidize
still
more
eventually
the
wire
may
start
getting
very
hot
melt
the
insulation
or
fixture
its
attached
to
and
possibly
even
cause
a
fire
since
people
usually
encounter
aluminum
wiring
when
they
move
into
a
house
built
during
the
we
will
cover
basic
points
of
safe
aluminum
wiring
we
suggest
that
if
youre
considering
purchasing
a
home
with
aluminum
wiring
or
have
discovered
it
later
that
you
hire
a
licensed
electrician
or
inspector
to
check
over
the
wiring
for
the
following
things
fixtures
eg
outlets
and
switches
directly
attached
to
aluminum
wiring
should
be
rated
for
it
the
device
will
be
stamped
with
alcu
or
coalr
the
latter
supersedes
the
former
but
both
are
safe
these
fixtures
are
somewhat
more
expensive
than
the
ordinary
ones
wires
should
be
properly
connected
at
least
way
around
the
screw
in
a
clockwise
direction
connections
should
be
tight
while
repeated
tightening
of
the
screws
can
make
the
problem
worse
during
the
inspection
it
would
pay
off
to
snug
up
each
connection
note
that
aluminum
wiring
is
still
often
used
for
the
main
service
entrance
cable
it
should
be
inspected
pushin
terminals
are
an
extreme
hazard
with
aluminum
wire
any
connections
using
pushin
terminals
should
be
redone
with
the
proper
screw
connections
immediately
there
should
be
no
signs
of
overheating
darkened
connections
melted
insulation
or
baked
fixtures
any
such
damage
should
be
repaired
connections
between
aluminum
and
copper
wire
need
to
be
handled
specially
current
canadian
codes
require
that
the
wire
nut
used
must
be
specially
marked
for
connecting
aluminum
to
copper
the
nec
requires
that
the
wire
be
connected
together
using
special
crimp
devices
with
an
antioxidant
grease
the
tools
and
materials
for
the
latter
are
quite
expensive
not
practical
to
do
it
yourself
unless
you
can
rent
the
tool
any
nonrated
receptacle
can
be
connected
to
aluminum
wiring
by
means
of
a
short
copper
pigtail
see
above
shows
reasonable
workmanship
neat
wiring
properly
stripped
not
nicked
wire
etc
if
when
considering
purchasing
a
home
an
inspection
of
the
wiring
shows
no
problems
or
only
one
or
two
we
believe
that
you
can
consider
the
wiring
safe
if
there
are
signs
of
problems
in
many
places
we
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
if
the
wrong
receptacles
are
used
you
can
replace
them
with
the
proper
type
or
use
pigtails
having
this
professionally
done
can
range
from
to
per
receptacleswitch
you
can
do
this
yourself
too
subject
im
buying
a
house
what
should
i
do
congratulations
but
its
generally
a
good
idea
to
hire
an
inspector
to
look
through
the
house
for
hidden
gotchas
not
just
for
wiring
but
plumbing
and
structural
as
well
if
an
inspection
of
the
wiring
shows
no
problems
or
only
one
or
two
minor
ones
we
believe
that
you
can
consider
the
wiring
safe
after
any
minor
problems
are
fixed
if
there
are
signs
of
problems
in
many
places
we
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
heres
some
hints
on
what
to
look
for
obvious
noncode

include
zip
cord
wiring
either
concealed
or
nailed

hot
wiring
on

romex
swinging
about
like
grapevines
certain
wiring
practises
that
are
actually
to
code
or
were
at
one
time
sometimes
reveal
diy
wiring
that
may
have
hidden
violations
switches
that
seem
to
control
nothing
abandoned
perhaps
not
properly
terminated
wiring
a
wall

that
shuts
off
a
group
of
lights
that
are
separately
controlled
by
other
wall
switches
except
when
its
really
convenient

in
bizarre
locations
great

subject
what
is
this
weird
stuff
old
style
wiring
in
the
years
since
edison
invented
electricity
several
different
wiring
styles
have
come
and
gone
when
you
buy
an
older
home
you
may
encounter
some
of
this
stuff
this
section
describes
the
old
methods
and
some
of
their
idiosyncrasies
the
oldest
wiring
system
youre
likely
to
encounter
is
called
knob
and
tube
kt
it
is
made
up
of
individual
conductors
with
a
cloth
insulation
the
wires
are
run
along
side
structural
members
eg
joists
or
studs
using
ceramic
standoffs
knobs
wire
is
run
through
structural
members
using
ceramic
tubes
connections
were
made
by
twisting
the
wire
together
soldering
and
wrapping
with
tape
since
the
hot
and
neutral
were
run
separately
the
wiring
tends
to
be
rather
confusing
a
neutral
often
runs
down
the
centre
of
each
room
with
taps
off
to
each
fixture
the
hot
wire
tended
to
run
from
one
fixture
to
the
next
in
some
cases
kt
isnt
colourcoded
so
the
neutral
is
often
the
same
colour
as
the
hot
wires
youll
see
kt
in
homes
built
as
late
as
the
comments
on
kt
the
people
installing
kt
were
pretty
paranoid
about
electricity
so
the
workmanship
tends
to
be
pretty
good
the
wire
insulation
and
insulators
tend
to
stand
up
very
well
most
kt
ive
seen
for
example
is
in
quite
good
condition
no
grounding
grounding
is
usually
difficult
to
install
boxes
are
small
receptacle
replacement
particularly
with
gfci
can
be
difficult
no
bushing
on
boxes
either
so
wiring
changes
need
special
attention
to
box
entry
sometimes
the
neutral
isnt
balanced
very
well
between
separately
hot
circuits
so
it
is
sometimes
possible
to
overload
the
neutral
without
exceeding
the
fusing
on
any
circuit
building
code
does
not
permit
insulation
in
walls
that
contain
kt
connection
to
existing
kt
from
new
circuits
can
be
tricky
consult
your
inspector
modern
wiring
practise
requires
considerably
more
outlets
to
be
installed
than
kt
systems
did
since
kt
tends
to
be
in
pretty
decent
condition
it
generally
isnt
necessary
to
replace
it
simply
because
its
kt
what
you
should
watch
out
for
is
renovations
that
have
interfered
with
it
and
be
cautious
about
circuit
loading
in
many
cases
its
perfectly
reasonable
to
leave
existing
kt
alone
and
add
new
fixtures
on
new
circuits
using
modern
techniques
after
kt
they
invented
multiconductor
cable
the
first
type
you
will
see
is
roughly
a
cloth
and
varnish
insulation
it
looks
much
like
the
romex
cable
of
the
last
decade
or
two
this
stuff
was
used
in
the
and
again
no
grounding
conductor
it
was
installed
much
like
modern
wiring
its
major
drawback
is
that
this
type
of
insulation
embrittles
weve
seen
whole
systems
where
the
insulation
would
fracture
and
fall
off
at
a
touch
bx
cable
of
the
same
vintage
has
similar
problems
this
stuff
is
very
fragile
and
becomes
rather
hazardous
if
the
wires
become
bare
this
wiring
should
be
left
untouched
as
much
as
possible
whenever
an
opportunity
arises
replace
it
a
simple
receptacle
or
switch
replacement
can
turn
into
a
several
hour
long
frustrating
fight
with
electrical
tape
or
heatshrink
tubing
after
this
wiring
technique
the
more
modern
romex
was
invented
its
almost
a
asphalt
impregnated
cloth
often
a
bit
sticky
this
stuff
stands
up
reasonably
well
and
doesnt
present
a
hazard
and
is
reasonably
easy
to
work
with
it
does
not
need
to
be
replaced
it
should
be
considered
as
safe
as
the
modern
stuff
thermoplastic
insulation
wire
just
dont
abuse
it
too
much
subject
where
do
i
buy
stuff
try
to
find
a
proper
electrical
supply
outlet
near
you
their
prices
will
often
be
considerably
better
than
chain
hardware
stores
or
diy
centres
have
better
quality
materials
have
wider
variety
including
the
odd
stuff
and
have
people
behind
the
counter
that
know
what
youre
talking
about
cultivate
friendly
knowledgeable

people
theyll
give
you
much
valuable

i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
water
nuclear
stations
dont
generate
electricity
directly
from
the
reactor
they
use
the
reactor
to
generate
heat
the
heat
is
then
used
to
heat
water
just
as
in
a
conventional
oil
or
coal
station
and
the
resultant
steam
drives
the
turbines
the
cooling
towers
are
used
to
cool
the
steam
and
recondense
it
into
water
to
continue
the
cycle

only
once
did
i
have

i
was
narrowing
the

down
to
a
specific
pole
by
bumping
a
whole
line
of
poles
with

got
em
out
there
that
night
and
they
didnt
have
to
meet
jack
as
a

their
method
for

loose

was
usually
whacking
the
poles
with

sledgehammer
after

couldnt

to

so
even
today
they
use

running

they
cant

anymore
as
bill
noted
the
only
way
is
to

the

is

bigger

as
anywhere

people
dont
like
if
you
tell

that

was
thinking

seperates
i
have
heard
from
alot
of
people
though
that
adcom
sounds
great
but
that
the
components
are
made
cheaply
and
therefore
wont
last
very
long
the
time
estimates
ive
heard
are
like
only
or
years
is
this
true
i
own
the
adcom
power
amp
as
far
as
im
concerned
theres
no
amp
which
can
touch
it
at
the
price
range
the
build
quality
is
very
impressive
and
is
far
superior
to
other
amps
in
the
price
range
the
whole
amplifier
is
extremely
solid
with
massive
heat
sinks
and
very
solid
casing
if
you
open
the
amp
up
there
are
only
very
good
quality
components
in
and
the
amp
seems
to
be
designed
extremely
well
perfect
symmetry
for
both
channels
and
two
transformers
one
for
each
channel
the
binding
posts
on
the
back
of
the
amplifier
are
virtually
the
same
as
those
on
the
classe
model
ie
very
good
i
was
also
sceptical
about
the
amps
being
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
components
they
use
and
how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
i
cannot
see
why
people
say
the
amplifier
wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
my
last
point
i
recently
auditioned
the
adcom
preamp
something
like
the
or
something
it
was
two
years
old
and
it
still
sounded
like
new
if
you
build
an
amplifier
decently
like
the
adcoms
they
will
sound
brilliant
and
last
a
long
time

and
the

is
stored

whats
the
chance
of
this
working
any
systems

this

what
kind
of

could
you

what
would
something

to
prototype
is
there
a
better
alternative
than
microwaves
of
course
you
could
develope
this
system
but
there
is
already
a
system
called
global
positioning
satellites
it
gives
three
dimensional
coordinates
anywhere
on
earth
many
surveyors
use
this
system
with
a
differential
receivertransmitter
to
get
coordinates
within

basic

with
resolution
of
a

there
are
two

one
for

one
for

ones
the
civil
precision
is
about
to
correct
me
if
im
wrong
though
it
may
be
insufficiant
for
mapping
buildings
but
there
is
a
way
with
an
additional
reference
point
eg
one
fixed
gps
system
in
a
house
to
get
the
same
high
precision
as
the
military
version
but
it
gets
pretty
complicated
then
if
you
use
a
microwave
system
actually
this
means
some
type
of
radar
you
need
quite
a
lot
of
number
crunching
to
get
accurate
vectorized
data
out
of
your

the

works

here
first
go

pick
up
a

of

simplified
by
hl
richter
now
if
your

conduit
you
dont

a

wire
assuming
the
house
is
wired
correctly
and
the

are

pipe
in

basement
the
outlets
that
have
a
neutral
hooked
to
the
ground
screw
seem
wrong
anyone
else
think
so
back
in
the
i
was
a
service
technician
for
a
cash
register
company
the
cash
registers
used
microprocessor
circuits
and
back
then
they
were
very
susceptible
to
electrostatic
discharge
and
line
noise
the
biggest
problems
came
from
outlets
that
were
not
properly
grounded
in
almost
every
place
we
went
to
do
an
installation
we
found
outlets
with
the
ground
connected
to
the
neutral
for
of
the
things
you
can
plug
into
one
of
these
they
work
fine
for
our
cash
registers
they
were
a
nightmare
line
noise
tended
to
scramble
the
memory
periodically
with
modern
electronics
using
switching
power
supplies
this
should
be
less
of
a
problem
even
the
company
i
used
to
work
for
is
no
longer
recommending
a
dedicated
line
with
a
seperate
ground
for
their
equipment
i
imagine
if
you
check
most
household
wiring
you
will
find
that
the
ground
and

are
connected
although
not

it

whats

reasoning
here
what
you
can
do
if
you
want
threeprong
outlets
without
additional
wiring
is
to
use
a
gfci
outlet
or
breaker
but
the
outlet
will
be
cheaper
in
fact
depending
on
where
you
are
putting
your
new
outlets
a
gfci
may
be
required
you
still
need
to
supply
a
proper
ground
for
a
ground
fault
circuit
interrupter
so
rewiring
is
still
a
part
of
this
job
however
the
ground
may
be
connected
to
a
local
earth
ground
rather
than
back
at
the
breaker
box
as
jamie
said
gfci
devices
are
required
by
code
in
a
number
of
places
most
notably
bathrooms
and
outside
the
house
i
do
suggest
the
use
of
gfci
outlets
rather
than
the
breakers
you
will
end
up
with
much
less
headaches
noise
pickup
in
long
cable
runs
is
sometimes
enough
to
cause
frequent
tripping
of
the
breakers
gfci
devices
do
save
lives
if
you
decide
to
install
them
be
sure
to
check
them
regularly

i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
i
hope
someone
can
help
during
the
nuclear
fission
reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
this
happens
the
liquid
uranium
is
pumped
to
the
cooling
tower
where
it
is
sprayed
into
the
air
contact
with
the
cool
outside
air
will
condense
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cooling
tower
floor
there
it
is
collected
by
a
cleaning
crew
using
shop
vacs
and
is
then
reformed
into
pellets
for
reactor
use
the
next
day
cooling
towers
are
a
lot
taller
than
they
really
need
to
be
power
companies
are
forced
to
make
them
that
tall
by
some
enviromental
law
that
requires
the
raw
uranium
emisions
to
be
held
to
under
this
law
is
now
under
attack
by
lawyers
arguing
that
the
should
be
measured
at
the
edge
of
the
property
rather
than
the
edge
of
the
cooling
tower
eliminating
this
law
will
save
power

so
heres
my

it
seems
to
me
that
id
have
the

if
i
hooked
a

from

screw

whats
wrong
with
my
reasoning
here
may
i
respectfully
suggest
you
not
do
this
the
ground
is
supposed
to
be
a
protective
ground
and
though
what
you
suggest
looks
good
on
paper
its
dangerous
to
rely
on
the
same
wire
for
power
and
protection
itd
never
meet
code
and
if
you
now
own
the
property
and
later
sell
it
you
may
end
up
with
liabilities
you
dont
want
and
if
you
dont
now
own
it
well
theres
a
wiring
faq
that
i
think
addresses
this
i
believe
an
alternative
is
use
of
a
gfci
but
im
really
not
sure
what
current
code
allows
in
this
area
the
gfci
senses
alternate
unwanted
current
paths
and
doesnt
rely
on
a

not

john
what
you

is
very
close
to
what
i
built

described
in
the
arrl

network

i
built
watt
fsk
transceivers
at

they
are
essentially
double
conversion
transverters
with
digital
mod
and
demod
at

the
receiver
uses
the
which
is
the
same
fsk
receiver
chip
i
used
previouslyu
in
the
mbps
ghz
data
link
i
first
published
in

radio
and
which
is
now
also
in
the

the
which
includes
a
vhf
converter
section
could
also
be
used
at
these
speeds
there
is
a
newer
and
perhaps
slightly
improved
design
of
this
the
if
i
remember
rightly
while
using
this
would
have
let
me
reduce
the
external

count
on

it
didnt
really
offer
all
that
much
help

so
i
didnt
bother
with
it
the
radios
i
built
were
first
designed
and
built
for
kbps
in
a
mhz
channel
but
later
reduced
to
half
that
these
kbps
radios
actually
have
done
quite
well
in

pretty

would

if

you
can

thats
how

an

hot

cauz
even
though
the

way
excessive
heat
will
dramatically
shorten
the
life
of
any
electronic
component
regardless
of

in
fact
an
amp
that
does
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
because
either
the

is
that
channel
therefore
blown
i
then
shut
the
radio
off
and
ran
continuity
into
the
two
speaker
ouputs
of
the
channel
and
it
charged
and
discharged
so
i
know
the
wires
just
aint
bad
this
probably
only
tells
you
that
the
dc
blocking
capacitor
thats
in
series
between
the
onechip
singleended
audio
amp
and
the
speaker
terminal
is
there
any
ideas
open
it
up
and
look
for
the
power
amp
ics
theyll
be
fairly
obvious
replace
the
one
connected
to
the
dead
output
also
how
would
i
locate
where
the
signal
of
the
radiotape
unit
is
before
it
gets
amplified
because
then
couldnt
i
hook
up
rca
outputs
to
that
signal
so
then
he
could
just
use
a
little
amplifier
well
one
thing
you
should
do
is
poke
around
the
terminals
of
the
power
amp
chips
use
a
probe
with
a
resistor
like
a
scope
probe
connected
to
the
input
of
a
small
audio
amp
wspeaker
if
you
find
linelevel
input
to
both
chips
one
of
the
chips
is
bad
and
can
probably
replaced
pretty
easily
if
you
want
to
pick
off
a
nearlinelevel
signal
suitable
for
feeding
to
an
outboard
amp
the
outer
legs
of
the
volume
control
pot
will
often
be
good
enough
this
is
before
the
volume
control
and
usually
before
the
tone
and
balance
controls
too
if
you
take
off
from
the
center
and
ground
legs
of
the
volume
pot
this
will
be
after
the
volume
control
but
again
probably
before
the
other
controls
if
the
unit
is
a
modern
type
with
an
electronic
volume
control
chip
you
should
probably
forget
the
whole
thing

trim

for

you

since
the

varies

its

you

about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever

at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
except
for
their
size
the
cooling
towers
on
nuclear
power
plants
are
vertually
identical
in
construction
and
operation
to
cooling
towers
designed
and
built
in
the
a
hundred
years
ago
for
coal
fired
power
plants
used
for
lighting
and
early
electric
railways
basicly
the
cylindrical
tower
supports
a
rapid
air
draft
when
its
air
is
heated
by
hot
water
andor
steam
circulating
thru
a
network
of
pipes
that
fill
about
the
lower
of
the
tower
to
assist
cooling
and
the
draft
water
misters
are
added
that
spray
cold
water
over
the
hot
pipes
the
cold
water
evaporates
removing
the
heat
faster
than
just
air
flow
from
the
draft
would
and
the
resulting
water
vapor
is
rapidly
carried
away
by
the
draft
this
produces
the
clouds
frequently
seen
rising
out
of
these
towers
that
slight
pinch
maybe
of
the
way
up
the
tower
is
there
because
it
produces
a
very
significant
increase
in
the
strength
and
rate
of
the
air
draft
produced
compared
to
a
straight
cylinder
shape
the
towers
are
used
to
recondense
the
steam
in
the
sealed
steam
system
of
the
power
plant
so
that
it
can
be
recirculated
back
to
the
boiler
and
used
again
the
wider
the
temperature
difference
across
the
turbines
used
in
the
power
plant
the
more
effecient
they
are
and
by
recondensing
the
steam
in
the
cooling
towers
before
sending
it
back
to
the
boilers
you
maintain
a
very
wide
temperature
difference
sometimes
as
high
as
degrees
or
more
from
first
stage
hot
turbine
to
final
stage
cold

an

they
needed

the
purpose
was
to

was
a

a

i
got
the

from

that
devices

so
that

i

is
that
possible
i
thought
the
maximum
rate
the

was
even
capable
of
displaying

was
of
a
second
or
of
a

for
an

composed
of
only
odd
or
even

you
are
correct
the
fastest
complete
image
that
could
be
presented
on

would
be
one

which
is
of
a

approximately
of

the
phrase

is
often
thrown
around
in

perhaps
this

wasnt

i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
except
for
their
size
the
cooling
towers
on
nuclear
power
plants
are
vertually
identical
in
construction
and
operation
to
cooling
towers
designed
and
built
in
the
a
hundred
years
ago
for
coal
fired
power
plants
used
for
lighting
and
early
electric
railways
basicly
the
cylindrical
tower
supports
a
rapid
air
draft
when
its
air
is
heated
by
hot
water
andor
steam
circulating
thru
a
network
of
pipes
that
fill
about
the
lower
of
the
tower
to
assist
cooling
and
the
draft
water
misters
are
added
that
spray
cold
water
over
the
hot
pipes
the
cold
water
evaporates
removing
the
heat
faster
than
just
air
flow
from
the
draft
would
and
the
resulting
water
vapor
is
rapidly
carried
away
by
the
draft
this
produces
the
clouds
frequently
seen
rising
out
of
these
towers
that
slight
pinch
maybe
of
the
way
up
the
tower
is
there
because
it
produces
a
very
significant
increase
in
the
strength
and
rate
of
the
air
draft
produced
compared
to
a
straight
cylinder
shape
the
towers
are
used
to
recondense
the
steam
in
the
sealed
steam
system
of
the
power
plant
so
that
it
can
be
recirculated
back
to
the
boiler
and
used
again
the
wider
the
temperature
difference
across
the
turbines
used
in
the
power
plant
the
more
effecient
they
are
and
by
recondensing
the
steam
in
the
cooling
towers
before
sending
it
back
to
the
boilers
you
maintain
a
very
wide
temperature
difference
sometimes
as
high
as
degrees
or
more
from
first
stage
hot
turbine
to
final
stage

there
has
been
quite
a
bit

about

and

practices
here
a
few
points
need
to
be
clarified
the
equipment
grounding
conductor
green
green
with
a
yellow
stripe
bare
or
the
metal
sheath
or
pipe
of
some
wiring
methods
is
used
as
a
safety
ground
to
carry
fault
currents
back
to
the
circuit
breaker
panel
and
to
limit
the
voltage
on
the
metal
case
of
utilization
equipment
or
other
metal
objects
it
should
never
except
for
a
few
exceptions
to
be
discussed
later
carry
the
normal
operating
current
of
a
connected
load
some
equipment
has
filters
in
the
power
supply
which
may
cause
some
slight
current
flow
through
the
grounding
conductor
much
communications
or
audio
equipment
is
sensitive
to
noise
or
slight
voltages
on
the
grounding
conductor
and
may
require
special
wiring
of
the
grounding
conductors
to
provide
reliable
operation
orange
outlets
are
often
used
for
this
with
insulated
grounding
conductors
wired
back
to
the
panel
box
and
in
many
cases
back
to
the
service
anyone
installing
such
a
system
should
read
both
the
section
on
grounding
in
the
national
electric
code
and
publications
on
installing
quiet
isolated
ground
systems
the
code
requires
the
insulated
grounding
conductors
green
wires
to
run
with
the
current
carrying
conductors
back
to
the
panel
box
and
if
required
back
all
the
way
to
the
service
entrance
where
it
is
bonded
to
the
service
ground
water
pipe
or
rod
many
of
these
systems
are
installed
illegally
or
unsafely
where
they
do
not
provide
a
safe
ground
or
a
quiet
ground
or
either
the
grounded
conductor
of
a
circuit
often
called
the
neutral
which
is
referred
to
in
the
code
as
the
identified
conductor
and
is
supposed
to
be
white
or
natural
grey
this
conductor
is
supposed
to
be
connected
to
ground
in
most
electrical
systems
at
a
single
point
generally
at
the
service
entrance
panel
this
connection
is
through
the
main
bonding
jumper
in
many
household
service
panels
the
main
bonding
jumper
is
actually
a
bonding
screw
which
attaches
the
neutral
busbar
to
the
case
of
the
panel
the
grounded
conductor
neutral
is
generally
a
current
carrying
conductor
in
the
case
of
a
volt
circuit
it
is
one
of
the
two
conductors
completing
the
circuit
from
the
panel
to
the
load
device
since
the
grounded
conductor
neutral
is
only
connected
to
the
grounding
conductor
bare
or
green
at
the
service
entrance
if
the
load
is
any
distance
from
the
service
and
draws
any
significant
current
there
will
be
a
small
but
measurable
voltage
between
the
grounded
and
grounding
conductors
at
the
load
under
normal
operating
conditions
if
you
should
incorrectly
connect
the
grounded
neutral
conductor
to
the
grounding
conductor
at
the
load
some
of
the
neutral
current
will
flow
instead
through
the
grounding
conductor
since
there
will
now
be
current
flowing
through
the
grounding
conductor
it
will
also
no
longer
be
quite
at
ground
potential
at
the
load
end
if
the
load
equipment
has
a
metal
case
which
is
connected
to
the
grounding
conductor
through
the
u
ground
plug
the
metal
case
is
now
also
no
longer
quite
at
ground
potential
the
difference
under
normal
non
shortcircuit
conditions
may
be
only
a
few
tenths
of
a
volt
but
it
could
also
be
a
volt
or
two
this
normally
does
not
present
a
shock
hazard
however
if
you
let
the
metal
case
of
the
grounded
equipment
come
into
contact
with
an
independently
grounded
object
such
as
a
water
or
gas
pipe
a
radiator
a
metal
air
conditioning
duct
or
such
part
of
the
neutral
current
will
try
to
flow
through
this
aalternate
ground
path
if
the
contact
is
not
solid
you
will
get
a
significant
arc
a
low
voltage
but
possibly
moderate
current
arc
under
the
wrong
conditions
this
arcing
could
start
a
fire
it
is
possible
in
some
cases
that
the
sneak
ground
current
could
also
flow
through
a
wire
of
inadequate
size
causing
it
to
overheat
with
the
incorrect
non
singlepoint
grounding
of
the
neutral
if
there
is
a
short
circuit
from
hot
to
neutral
the
high
short
circuit
current
which
may
flow
will
cause
a
much
higher
voltage
on
the
grounding
conductor
which
increases
the
possibility
for
shock
or
fire
also
if
you
incorrectly
multiply
connect
the
neutral
and
ground
the
voltage
on
the
ground
system
is
seen
as
noise
bu
computer
or
audio
equipment
often
causing
malfunction
i
have
spent
some
hours
tracking
down
such
shorts
in
technical
facilities
where
they
were
inducing
severe
hum
into
equipment
the
neutral
is
usually
bonded
to
the
ground
at
the
distribution
transformer
as
well
as
at
the
service
entrance
of
each
dwelling
this
is
done
primarily
for
lightning
protection
so
that
induced
lightning
currents
have
a
short
path
back
to
ground
and
also
to
assure
that
the
currents
drawn
by
shorts
to
grounded
objects
like
pipes
draw
enough
current
to
trip
circuit
breakers
or
blow
fuses
quickly
the
bad
side
of
this
is
that
not
all
the
neutral
current
from
the
dwelling
goes
through
the
neutral
wire
back
to
the
transformer
some
of
it
flows
through
the
grounding
electrode
water
pipe
etc
this
may
cause
corrosion
in
the
pipes
and
possibly
in
things
like
underground
fuel
oil
tanks
and
it
may
also
cause
measurable
ac
magnetic
fields
due
to
the
large
loop
between
the
hot
conductors
in
the
service
and
the
neutral
current
in
the
water
pipe
and
ground
there
are
those
who
feel
these
fields
may
be
unhealthy
dont
flame
me
on
this
im
just
telling
you
where
the
field
comes
from
not
its
health
effect
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
note
that
the
bonding
jumper
is
only
installed
at
the
main
panel
not
at
any
sub
distribution
panels
this
is
one
reason
why
it
is
illegal
to
run
service
entrance
cable
with
the
sheath
used
as
a
neutral
to
a
sub
panel
you
must
have
a
seperate
insulated
conductor
for
the
neutral
the
sheath
can
be
used
in
this
application
only
as
the
grounding
conductor
if
the
neutral
is
bonded
to
the
grounding
conductor
in
the
sub
panel
say
by
forgetting
to
remove
the
bonding
screw
all
the
grounding
conductors
of
the
loads
on
that
panel
will
be
above
ground
with
the
possible
problems
listed
above
the
code
makes
exceptions
for
ranges
and
dryers
as
well
as
feeds
from
one
building
to
another
in
the
cases
of
the
range
and
dryer
the
neutral
may
be
used
as
the
equipment
ground
under
certain
conditions
instead
of
a
seperate
wire
every
time
the
code
is
revised
these
exceptions
come
up
for
review
these
exceptions
were
in
fact
the
first
required
safety
grounds
in
the
days
before
u
ground
outlets
and
such
the
appliance
manufacturers
dont
want
to
have
to
redesign
their
ranges
and
driers
and
the
contractors
dont
want
to
have
to
run
four
wire
cable
with
four
fairly
heavy
expensive
wires
in
place
of
three
wire
to
the
appliances
no
question
it
would
be
safer
with
seperate
neutrals
to
the
stove
but
the
neutral
current
is
low
for
most
burner
settings
since
most
current
is
in
the
volt
hots
except
at
some
low
settings
the
wires
are
large
gauge
and
there
are
few
reported
cases
of
injury
or
damage
so
far
the
exceptions
have
survived
in
the
case
of
feeds
between
buildings
its
primarily
for
lightning
protection
people
doing
wiring
should
be
aware
what
is
and
what
isnt
a
legal
grounding
conductor
obviously
the
bare
wire
in
romex
with
ground
is
anywhere
there
is
a
green
wire
installed
such
as
in
a
portable
cord
that
is
a
good
grounding
conductor
the
sheath
of
bx
clamped
in
bx
connectors
in
metal
boxes
is
a
legal
grounding
conductor
in
the
us
bx
has
an
aluminum
band
run
under
the
steel
sheath
to
lower
the
resistance
of
the
sheath
you
can
just
cut
this
aluminum
band
off
at
the
ends
you
dont
have
to
bond
it
to
anything
it
does
its
job
by
touching
every
turn
of
the
bx
sheath
conduit
or
emt
thinwall
tubing
is
generally
a
legal
grounding
conductor
but
may
require
a
bonding
locknut
where
it
enters
a
box
or
panel
particularly
for
larger
pipes
greenfield
looks
like
big
bx
but
you
pull
your
own
wires
in
the
empty
sheath
after
you
run
it
is
not
a
legal
grounding
conductor
as
it
doesnt
have
the
aluminum
band
to
bond
it
and
the
spiral
steel
has
too
much
resistance
and
inductance
you
have
to
run
a
seperate
green
grounding
conductor
inside
the
greenfield
wiremold
is
also
not
a
legal
grounding
conductor
as
the
paint
on
the
boxes
often
prevents
good
contact
and
the
feed
to
the
wiremold
extension
is
often
from
a
box
in
the
wall
that
may
not
be
well
connected
to
the
first
wiremold
box
i
have
personally
discovered
cases
where
the
entire
run
of
wiremold
and
the
cases
of
everything
plugged
into
all
the
outlets
on
the
run
were
hot
with
volts
why
do
i
get
a
shock
every
time
i
touch
my
computer
and
the
radiator
here
in
the
office
because
there
was
no
ground
wire
in
the
wiremold
and
one
of
the
outlets
had
shorted
to
the
edge
of
the
wiremold
box
you
must
run
a
ground
wire
back
in
the
wiremold
from
the
outlets
at
least
to
the
first
box
in
the
original
wiring
conduit
bx
etc
where
you
can
bond
the
wire
to
the
box
with
a
screw
bnding
clip
or
whatever
on
another
issue
while
you
should
ground
the
green
wirelug
on
gcfi
outlets
when
ever
there
is
a
place
to
ground
them
it
is
legal
in
the
nec
to
use
them
without
a
ground
if
no
ground
is
available
it
is
better
to
have
the
protection
of
the
ground
fault
interrupter
than
no
protection
if
you
dont
install
it
the
interrupter
doesnt
depend
on
the
ground
to
trip
it
is
desirable
to
connect
the
ground
if
available
because
if
the
ground
is
connected
the
interrupter
will
trip
as
soon
as
a
faulty
device
is
plugged
in
whereas
without
the
ground
it
will
not
trip
until
someone
or
something
provides
a
ground
path
for
those
questioning
the

what

great

however
you
left
off
one
detail
why
do
you
always
see
them
at
nuclear
plants
but
not
always
at
fossil
fuel
plants
at
nuclear
plants
it
is
prefered
to
run
the
water
closed
cycle
whereas
fossil
fuel
plants
can
in
some
cases
get
away
with
dumping
the
hot
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
oil
and
gas
fired
steam
plants
also
have
condensers
but
they
usually
are
sized
to
get
the
steam
back
into
hot
water
not
most
of
the
way
down
to
ambient
some
plants
do
cool
the
condensers
with
water
rather
than
air
as
one
canadian
official
asked
about
thermal
pollution
deicing
a

we

otherwise

in

its
possible
that

ignorance

not
a
defence
against

it
might
reduce
the
damages
a

would
award
however
unless
there
was
something
seriously
novel
about
the

almost
certainly
it
is
obvious
to
one
skilled

i
am
a
novice
at
microcontrollers
but
i
am
starting
to
get
into
them
for
some
of
my
projects
i
have
several
simms
laying
around
from
upgraded
macs
and
if
i
could
use
them
as

in
one
or
two
of
my
projects
that
would
be
great
one
project
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
caller
id
device
that
would
require
quite
a
bit
of
ram
to
store
several
hundered
cid
records
etc
assuming
in
expanded
muxed
mode
you
could
do
it
much
easier
if
you
get
a
dram
controller
ic
the
mmi
could
be
used
to
implement
this
or
you
could
use
a
counter
and
a
huge
multiplexer
to
provide
rowcolumnrefresh
address
multiplexing
the
thing
with
drams
is
that
they
require
wierd
timing
address
multiplexing
and
refresh
actually
if
you
wanted
to
use
a
ic
you
could
look
at
which
has
a
neat
controller
built
in
there
is
also
the
i
think
one
of
those
has
the
dram
controller
built
in
this
one
is
for
the
dram
however
the
has
only
one
more
address
line
adding
only
another
component
or
so
the
simms
are
basically
or
dram
chips
or
their
equivalent
in
fewer
packages
it
can
be
done
just
takes
a

actually
fossil

plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
as
a
point
of
info
some
of
the
early
nuclear
power
plants
in
this
country
used
the
fission
pile
as
a
first
stage
to
get
the
water
hot
and
then
had
a

you
are

it

the

they
use

there
are
two
ways
around
this
that
i
know
of
first
of
all
you
can
try
using
a
different
vcr
to
copy
onto
it
is
the
input
of
the
vcr
that
reacts
to
the
protection
so
sometimes
just
switching
the
two
vcrs
around
will
take
care
of
it
some
models
just
dont
react
to
it
does
this
also
affect
the
viewing
of
tapes
i
have
had
problems
with
a
couple
of
rented
tapes
they
were
virtually
unviewable
i
fiddled
with
the
tuning
tracking
and
vertical
hold
but
it
was
no
good
it
sounds
like
your
tv
is
one
of
the
ones
that
also
reacts
to
the
video
protection
poor
you
the
macroscrubber
from
radio
electronics
removes
the
protection
so
you
souldnt
have
any
more
problems
however
if
you
use
the
method
of
copying
it
from
one
vcr
to
another
where
the
second
vcr
doesnt
react
to
the
protection
you
will
end
up
with
a
duplicate
tape
including
the
protection
one
thought
comes
to
mind
about
your
problem
when
playing
the
tape
for
viewing
are
you
feeding
the
signal
from
the
source
vcr
through
an
extra
device
before
going
to
the
tv
if
you
feed
it
through
a
second
vcr
first
that
is
your
problem
as
to
other
devices
such
as
converters
i
dont
know
if
they
would
react
or
not
just
to
be
safe
you
might
want
to
make

to
use

theres
a

in

its

john

during
the
nuclear

reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
this
happens
the
liquid
uranium
is
pumped
to
the
cooling
tower
where
it
is
sprayed
into
the
air
contact
with
the
cool
outside
air
will
condense
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cooling

floor
there
it

a

i
think
you
posted
your
article
days
too
late
april
is
over
i
dont
like
nuclear
powerplants
but
i
think
its
not
fair
to
tell
such
storys
about
them
ok
let
me
try
to
explain
what
that
tower
is
used
to
even
the
modernst
nuclear
powerplant
is
only
a
simple
steamengine
it
has
an
hightech
boiler
but
the
rest
is
still
verry
verry
conventional
and
if
youve
already
visited
any
condensation
powerstation
youl
have
seen
the
cooling
towers
too
if
you
look
at
any
good
book
about
thermophysics
youll
find
a
chapter
about
the
carnotprocess
which
describes
how
to
get
energy
from
a
temperature
difference
and
that
is
the
reason
for
cooling
towers
too
you
only
can
get
energy
if
youve
an
temperature
gradient
that
means
that
you
have
steam
on
the
one
side
and
need
to
cool
down
the
steam
till
you
get
water
again
on
the
other
side
if
you
want
to
get
aprox
of
the
energy
you
or
better
the
uranium
brought
into
the
water
to
let
it
boil
if
you
only
have
hot
steam
on
the
one
and
cold
steam
on
the
other
side
youll
loose
much
more
of
the
energy
and
so
they
cool
down
the
steam
to
get
at
least
the
of
energy
that
carnot
will
give
them
the
cooling
towers
are
for
cooling
the
steam
the
vapor
youll
see
is
not
the
steam
of
the
main
core
circulation
because
that
steam
is
radioactive
the
circulation
is
divided
in
at
least
circuits
connected
about
heat
exchangers
to
prevent
radioactive
pollution
of
the
environment
ok
the
main
core
is
hot
but
even
in
the
modernst
hightemperature
reactors
htr
they
only
run
at
deg
celsius
this
is
still
verry
far
away
from
uraniums
melting
point
which
is
somewhere
around
deg
celsius
but
youll
have
lots
of
problems
with
the
boilers
steel
thats
because
at
this
temperature
the
metal
is
attacked
by
steam
and
will
corrode
verry
fast
this
is
only
for
bwrs
the
new
he
cooled
reactors
have
temperatures
up
to
deg
celsius
but
this
is
only
experimental
i
personaly
think
that
nuclear
waste
should
be
as
low
as
ever
possible
because
the
dose
you
get
will
accumulate
about
the
years
today
mrem
and
next
year
mrem
wont
be
mrem
at
all
it
accumulates
and
even
in

youll
still
have
mrem

great
explaination
however
you
left
off
one
detail
why
do
you
always
see
them
at
nuclear
plants
but
not
always
at
fossil
fuel
plants
at
nuclear
plants
it
is
prefered
to
run
the
water
closed
cycle
whereas
fossil
fuel
plants
can
in
some
cases
get
away
with
dumping
the
hot
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
the
reasons
you
dont
see
so
many
cooling
towers
at
fossil
plants
are
fossil
units
multiple
units
per
plant
are
generally
smaller
than
nuclear
plants
mwe
seemed
to
be
a
very
popular
size
when
many
fossil
plants
were
built
the
average
nuclear
plant
is
mwe
many
fossil
plants
were
grandfathered
when
water
discharge
regulations
were
adopted
why
those
old
dirt
burners
cant
harm
anything
let
em
go
powered
draft
cooling
towers
low
enough
to
the
ground
to
be
generally
not
visible
from
offsite
are
quite
popular
with
fossil
plants
fossil
plants
used
to
get
much
less
regulatory
attention
than
nuclears
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
oil
and
gas
fired
steam
plants
also
have
condensers
but
they
usually
are
sized
to
get
the
steam
back
into
hot
water
not
most
of
the
way
down
to
ambient
some
plants
do
cool
the
condensers
with
water
rather
than
air
as
one
canadian
official
asked
about
thermal
pollution
deicing
a
river
said
up
here
we
view
heat
as
a
resource
actually
the
condensing
environment
is
essentially
the
same
for
plants
of
similar
size
the
issues
are
the
same
regardless
of
where
the
heat
comes
from
condensers
are
run
at
as
high
a
vacuum
as
possible
in
order
to
reduce
aerodynamic
drag
on
the
turbine
the
condenser
pressure
is
normally
waters
vapor
pressure
at
the
condensing
temperature
it
is
desirable
that
the
steam
exhaust
be
free
of
water
droplets
because
moisture
in
the
steam
causes
severe
erosion
damage
to
the
turbine
low
pressure
blades
and
because
entrained
water
moving
at
high
velocity
causes
erosion
of
the
condenser
tubes
the
coldest
and
thus
lowest
pressure
condensing
environment
is
always
the
best
a
related
issue
is
that
of
pumping
the
condensate
from
the
hotwell
where
the
water
ends
up
after
dripping
off
the
condenser
tubes
since
the
condenser
is
at
a
very
low
pressure
the
only
force
driving
the
condensate
into
the
hotwell
pumps
is
gravity
if
the
condensate
is
too
hot
or
the
gravity
head
is
too
low
the
condensate
will
reflash
into
steam
bubbles
and
cause
the
condensate
pumps
to
cavitate
this
is
a
particularly
destructive
form
of
cavitation
that
is
to
be
avoided
at
all
costs
the
hotwell
pumps
are
located
in
the
lowest
point
in
the
plant
in
order
to
provide
a
gravity
head
to
the
pumps
how
much
lower
they
must
be
is
a
function
of
how
hot
the
water
is
allowed
to
get
in
the
hotwell
typically
hotwell
temperatures
run
between
and
degrees
depending
on
the
temperature
of
the
river
water
this
term
is
used
to
describe
the
river
grade
water
even
when
the
cooling
tower
system
is
operating
in
closed
loop
mode
and
essentially
no
river
water
is
pumped
when
the
river
water
temperature
is
high
in
the
summer
operators
will
typically
allow
the
hotwell
level
to
rise
in
order
to
provide
more
gravity
head
there
is
a
tradeoff
involved
since
higher
hotwell
levels
will
encroach
onto
the
condensing
tubes
and
reduce
the
condenser
area
at
least
in
the
east
and
elsewhere
where
moisture
actually
exists
in
the
air
the
river
water
will
almost
always
be
cooler
than
the
discharge
water
from
the
cooling
towers
the
temperature
of
the
discharge
water
from
the
cooling
towers
is
set
by
the
ambient
air
temperature
and
humidity
it
is
very
rare
in
the
east
to
hear
of
actual
river
water
temperatures
exceeding
degrees
a
vast
difference
from
the
typical
days
degrees
humidity
we
see
routinely
in
the
east
it
is
not
unusual
particularly
where
the
econazis
have
been
successful
in
clamping
rigid
discharge
water
temperature
limits
on
a
plant
for
the
plant
to
have
to
reduce
the
firing
rate
when
the
air
temperature
gets
too
high
and
the
condenser
cannot
handle
the
heat
load
without
excessive
pressure
everybody

even
though

rated
to

that
way
excessive
heat
will
dramatically
shorten
the
life
of
any
electronic
component
regardless
of
quality
in
fact
an
amp
that
does
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
because
either
the
engineer
or
manufacturer
of
that
amp
wanted
to
skimp
on
heatsinking
or
cooling
to
save
costs
hmmmmm
sure
i
didnt
mean
to
imply
that
because
of
the
heat
generated
the
amp
sounds
good
my
adcom
gfp
runs
fairly
warm
not
hot
to
the
touch
but
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
the
amp
is
running
nicely
i
dont
like
it
when
an
amp
runs
deadcold
it
makes
one
think
that
the
amp
is
doing
nothing
the
heatsinks
that
adcom
uses
in
their
amps
are
certainly
far
for
skimpy
theyre
massive
things
with
heating
vents
both
below
and
above
more
than
enough
to
carry
away
excessive
heat

heres
a
rough
sketch
of
how
the
system
works
a
reference
station
with
a
very
exactly
known
position
computes
the
errors
in
the
incoming
gps
signals
these
errors
are
due
to
several
factors
including
atmospheric
distortion
sa
selective
availability
time
dithering
etc
the
reference
unit
contains
complex
computational
equipment
to
back
out
the
errors
in
its
position
since
it
knows
where
it
is
already
it
then
transmits
these
corrections
on
a
broadcast
which
is
available
to
any
number
of
relatively
local
receivers
if
the
receivers
are
nearby
and
are
using
the
same
satellites
as
the
reference
unit
the
errors
should
be
very
similar
for
the
reference
unit
and
the
receiver
unit
thus
the
receiver
unit
may
apply
the
corrections
calculated
by
the
reference
unit
the
us
coast
guard
is
currently
as
far
as
i
know
installing
a
series
of
coastline
transmitters
for
differential
gps
these
stations
will
use
existing
radio
towers
i
believe
the
frequency
is
to
be
approximately
khz
there
are
many
other
private
corporations
offering
dgps
signals
on
different
frequencies
for
example
pinpoint
offers
correction
signals
and
receiver
units
using
an
fm
broadcast
system
which
has
stations
all
across
the
us
the
correction
codes
are
usually
transmitted
using
the
rtcm
format
advertised
accuracies
espouse

meter

aaahh
a
problem
very
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
in
our
case
other
monitors
cause
this
problem
the
deflection
coil
of
other
monitors
to
be
specific
have
also
seen
a
monitor
backed
up
to
a
fuse
panel
exhibit
this
problem
this
sounds
like
your
problem
since
flourescent
lites
motors
etc
several
of
feet
away
seem
to
me
to
be
too
far
to
cause
it
but
the
juice
running
to
them
must
pass
nearby
your
monitor
fusebox
on
other
side
of
wall
maybe
we
started
specing
panasonic
video
monitors
switchable
input
linesvid
aud
svhs
on
one
this
stopped
the
wavy
interference
effect
on
the
computer
monitor
next
to
it
now
on
to
your
problem
you
need
what
is
known
as
mu
shielding
very
common
in
fact
almost
mandatory
on
electrostatic
deflection
type
oscopes
i
talked
to
a
ee
prof
he
said
get
a
coffee
can
cut
both
ends
off
mount
around
deflection
coil
of
interfering
monitor
be
careful
to
avoid
all
high
voltage
circuitry
especially
the
thicker
high
voltage
anode
lead
usually
colored
red
if
you
kill
yourself
dont
blamesue
me
use
plastic
or
other
nonconducting
standoffs
and
such
to
mount
can
now
i
would
assume
that
what
is
good
for
keeping
mag
fields
in
is
also
good
at
keeping
them
out
so
hopefully
thisll
work
by
mounting
shield
on
monitor
being
interfered
with
as
well
if
not
start
shielding
those
other

commonmode

i

a
few
questions
about
low

noise
i
have
noticed
that
the
waveform
synthesizer
that
i

using

has
some
relatively
large
common
mode
noise
on
it
i
am
using
this
synthesizer
to
null
out
another
transient
waveform
and
am
amplifying
the
difference
several
hundred
times
the
has
about
mvpp
of
common
mode
noise
and
this
tends
to
make
my
measurements
hard
to
repeat
the
noise
is
not
quite
in
sync
with
line
frequency
and
on
a
spectrum
analyzer
the
main
component
is
about
how
can
i
get
rid

the
noise
when
i
look
at
the
spectrum
using

hp
audio
range
analyzer
the

goes
away

minute
i
switch

isolation

i
am
guessing
the
anlayzer
has
a
diff
amp
on
the
input
since
it
will
read
accurately
down
to
dc
also

getting

i
wouldnt
expect
a

to
damage
the

remember
its

damped
so
it

fast

it

ps
or
does
it

of

the
rule
for

is
that
if
it
says
mc
that
means
it
works
exactly
the
way
the

specifies
if
it
says
xc
that
means
there
is
at

one
known
bug
often
these
bugs
are
small
and
obscure
you
might
never
run
into
them
in
practice
xc
units
are
often
preproduction
sample
devices
those
are
normally
distributed
for
evaluation
as
freebies
and
are
not
guaranteed
to
meet
every
spec
at
least
motorola
admits
it
unlike
certain
other
companies
yep
thats
for

one
thing
i

hi
being

electronic
engineering
student
with
only
electronic
ii
under
my
belt
i
find
myself
needing
to
build
a
moderate
wattage
audio
amp
so
ill
throw
out
a
couple
of
question
for
the
vast
knowledge
of
the
net
please
explain
how
watts
are
calculated
in
audio
amp
circuits
no
not
pie
just
how
it
relates
to
one
of
the
following
ai
current
gain
av
voltage
gain
ap
power
gain
or
whatever
i
already
have
a
wonderful
cheap
ie
schematic
for
a
amp
but
i
would
like
to
crossimprove
the
circuit
the
problem
is
that
the
parts
list
has
and
as
amplifiers
they
look
like
pin
sip
packages
with
a
heatsink
this
schematic
was
published
in
a
mag
so
it
may
be
nonexistant
now
anyway
i
tried
looking
up
a
replacement
in
the
latest
digikey
cat
and
found
it
not
listed
the
closes
i
could
figure
was
a
pin
sip
as
anyone
got
any
ideas
i
thought
hey
i
can
rin
a
pspice
simulation
using
opamp
models
yea
great
it
worked
but
i
guess
the
wasnt
made
for
high
power
amps
as
a
result
i
got
a
voltage
gain
of
worse
than
i
started
with
does
anyone
have
a

file
with
cheap
yet

anyway
over
the
weekend
i
was
resting
on
the
sofa
in
between
chores
and
noticed
that
i
briefly
picked
up
what
sounded
like
ham
radio
traffic
over
my
stereo
and
television
even
though
both
were
off
also
all
the
touch
sensitive
lights
in
my
house
start
going
wacko
cycling
through
their
four
brightness
states
i
presume
that
some
ham
operator
with
an
illegal
amplifier
drove
past
my
house
i
live
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
would
this
be
a
correct
presumption
what
kind
of
power
must
he
be
putting
out
to
cause
the
effects
the
affected
equipment
is
about
feet
from
the
road
hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
for
cars
put
out
around
watts
it
is
possible
that
a
watt
radio
would
cause
interference
to
consumer
electronic
feet
away
most
tvs
stereos
and
vcrs
have
very
poor
rf
shielding
if
you
experience
the
problem
frequently
it
may
be
caused
by
a
ham
cber
or
other
radio
operator
in
a
base
station
nearby
the
interference
may
have
been
caused
by
a
radio
transmitter
used
for
other
purposes
such
as
police
fire
etc
if
you
heard
voices
over
your
stereo
i
think
you
are
correct
in
assuming
that
the
source
is
an
rf
transmitter
if
you
have
frequent
trouble
you
may
want
to
try
the
rf
ferrite
chokes
available
at
radio
shack
the
interference
is
probably
being
picked
up
by
your
speaker
wires
and
those
chokes
can
be
installed
on
the
wires
very
easily
without
cutting
them
good
instructions
are
included
with
the
chokes
if
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
you
may
want
to
search
your
neighborhood
for

radio
operator
look

antennas
on
the
roof
or

talk

about

there
are

homemade

automation
hi
all
im
an
assistant
manager
at
a
local
art
theater
here
in
columbus
id
like
to
expand
our
show
automation
a
bit
namely
add
the
capability
to
use
cue
tapes
to
bring
the
houselights
up
our
current
automation
consoles
date
from
the
early
and
dont
provide
this
function
we
already
have
the
combo
failsafecontact
rollers
to
read
the
cuetapes
and
our
dimmer
system
will
raise
the
houselights
when
its
fadeup
control
circuit
vac
is
momentarily
closed
for
at
least
second
ive
tried
wiring
the
dimmer
control
to
a
relay
activated
when
the
cue
tape
completes
the
circuit
low
tech
and
simple
but
theres
one
problem
in
order
to
get
the
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
a
shload
of
cuetape
on
the
film
runs
at
feet
per
minute
so
to
get
a
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
at
least
inches
of
solid
cuetape
ideally
i
would
like
to
use
a
single
crosscue
to
accomplish
this
function
a
single
strip
of
cuetape
perpendicular
to
the
length
of
the
film
this
would
give
a
pulse
of
approximately
of
a
second
what
i
need
is
a
circuit
to
detect
the
short
cue
and
activate
the
relay
for
around
second
the
ability
to
adjust
how
long
the
relay
is
activated
would
be
nice
i
figure
this
would
require
an
rc
circuit
of
some
sort
im
sure
some
of
you
already
have
the
solution
figured
out
in
your
heads
any
suggestions
and
schematics
would
be
appreciated

michael

the
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
is
that
two
capacitors
in

can
handle
twice
the
output
voltage
sometimes
two
elcos
in
antiseries
you
know
positive
sides
facing
eachother
are
used
to
obtain
a
large
capacitor
that
can
handle
positive
and
negative
voltages
as
well

there
probably
is
no

need
help
with
video
detection
circuit
i
am
trying
to
build
a
circuit
that
detects
the
presence
of
video
vs
a
blank
screen
by
monitoring
the
rg
and
b
outputs
of
a
graphics
card
it
should
be
able
to
detect
the
presence
of
a
single
pixel
at
mhz
which
would
mean
detecting
a
ns
pulse
it
should
also
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
blank
screen
about
mv
and
a
dim
screen
say
around
mv
oh
yes
it
also
needs
to
be
cheap
my
first
circuit
was
a
dismal
failure
i
used
compariators
each
compariator
had
the
input
going
to
one
of
the
guns
the
input
went
to
a
reference
created
by
a
voltage
dividera
potentiometer
the
first
problem
was
that
the
compariator
was
way
too
slow
i
needed
to
get
several
pixels
in
a
row
before
it
would
fire
the
compariators
so
i
could
have
a
whole
screen
full
of
text
but
my
circuit
would
not
detect
it
the
second
problem
is
that
there
was
more
noise
on
the
reference
then
the
smallest
difference
between
a
blank
screen
and
a
dim
screen
in
fact
the
difference
between
completely
black
and
completely
white
is
only
mv
i
am
wondering
if
i
am
going
to
have
to
amplify
the
video
signals
to
make
this
work
there
are
faster
compariators
but
they
are
expensive
and
require
split
supplies
i
would
need
to
replace
my
quad
compariator
with
three
compariators
and
create
a
whole
new
power
supply
circuit
at
this
point
i
think
what
i
need
is
some
sort
of
transistor
circuit
transistors
are
fast
and
cheap
and
should
do
the
trick
unfortunately
i
am
way
out
of
my
league
when
it
comes
to
designing
transistor
circuits
so
i
am
appealing
to
the
net
for
help
any
ideas
tips
circuits
pointers
references
etc
would
be
greatly
appreciated
oh
yes
i
only
sample
the
output
of
this
thing
every
second
or
so
so
i
dont
need
a
fast
response
time
at
all
however
i
havent
found
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
that
fact

over
the
weekend
i
was
resting
on
the
sofa
in
between
chores
and
noticed
that
i
briefly
picked
up
what
sounded
like
ham
radio
traffic
over
my
stereo
and
television
even
though
both
were
off
also
all
the
touch
sensitive
lights
in
my
house
start
going
wacko
cycling
through
their
four
brightness
states
i
presume
that
some
ham
operator
with
an
illegal
amplifier
drove
past
my
house
i
live
on
a
busy
thoroughfare
would
this
be
a
correct
presumption
what
kind
of
power
must
he
be
putting
out
to
cause
the
effects
the
affected
equipment
is
about
feet
from
the
road
hams
are
unlikely
to
have
an
illegal
amp
and
are
also
unlikely
to
have
a
dirty
amp
hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
i
can
just
see
it
you
need
to
slow
down
on
a
downgrade
so
you
hit
the
push
to
talk
button
for
cars
put
out
around
watts
it
is
possible
that
a
watt
radio
would
cause
interference
to
consumer
electronic
feet
away
most
tvs
stereos
and
vcrs
have
very
poor
rf
shielding
if
you
experience
the
problem
frequently
it
may
be
caused
by
a
ham
cber
or
other
radio
operator
in
a
base
station
nearby
the
interference
may
have
been
caused
by
a
radio
transmitter
used
for
other
purposes
such
as
police
fire
etc
if
you
heard
voices
over
your
stereo
i
think
you
are
correct
in
assuming
that
the
source
is
an
rf
transmitter
if
you
have
frequent
trouble
you
may
want
to
try
the
rf
ferrite
chokes
available
at
radio
shack
the
interference
is
probably
being
picked
up
by
your
speaker
wires
and
those
chokes
can
be
installed
on
the
wires
very
easily
without
cutting
them
good
instructions
are
included
with
the
chokes
if
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
you
may
want
to
search
your
neighborhood
for
a
radio
operator
look
for
antennas
on
the
roof
or
car
talk
to
himher
about
your
problem
there
are
things
a
radio
operator
can
do
to
reduce
interference
and
please
remember
to
be
friendly
when
approaching
your
local
radio
operator
this
person
may
or
may
not
be
the
cause
of
your
troubles
and
youll
get
better
cooperation
and
help
if
you
assume
that

is
going

it
is

how
is

missing
something
about
the

thing
bubblejets
often
splatter
a
little

whereas
laserjets
given
halfway
decent

like
hps
microfine
stuff
dont
both
produce
very
good
output
but
you
dont
have
to
look

at
the

to
tell
that
laserjet
output
is
definitely
superior
on
the

laserjets
which
havent

use

the

could
find
often
produce

are

a

which

provide

with

that

is
that
which
is
commonly
used
for
coordinate

of

eg
the

by

these
use
lateral

marsolais
to
determine
the
position
of
a
spot
of
light
projected
using
a
camera
lens
over
its

in
escence
the
detector
is
a
large
photodiode
with
four
cathodes
one
on

of
the
four
sides
of
the
square
detector
crystal
and
a

the

a

will
produce

which
are
proportional
to
the
position

if

then
the

is
given
by
this

regardless

the

is
used
to
normalize

power
when
this

is
used
in
the
presence

then
the
way
of

is
to
sample

the

contrary
to
some

near

the

that

a

the

it
wouldnt

replacing

would

a
of

need
not
be
the
same
as
a
to
demultiplexer
although
many
commercial
ssi
implementations
allow
you
to
use
one
as
such
strictly
a
of
decoder
need
only
take
two
lines
in
and
make
one
output
change
state
according
to
the
inputs
a
demux
on
the
other
hand
uses
two
control
inputs
to
determine
which
of
four
outputs
will
reflect
the
state
of
the
input
signal
so
there
are
three
inputs
required
a
decoder
can
be
used
as
a
demux
if
it
is
equipped
with
an
output
enable
input
since
this
can
be
used
as
the
data
input
eg
when
high
all
outputs
are
high
when
low
only
the
selected
by
control
inputs
output
will
be
low
an
eight
way
decoder
is
created
by
using
the
high
order
bit
bit
to
select
which
of
two
four
way
demuxes
is
enabled
thus
you
achieve
your
aim
of
having
only
one
output
of
eight
reflecting
the
input
bits
note
that
this
method
cannot
be
used
to
create
a
true
eight
way
demux
since
you
have
no
data
input
the
enable
line
on
a
four
way
decoder
left
once
you
commit
the
enable
lines
to
their
intended
purpose
a
sixteen
way
decoder
obviously
requires
four
fourway
decoders
plus
a
mechanism
to
enable
only
one
of
the
four
at
a
time
therefore
use
the
fifth
decoder
attached
to
the
two
high
order
bits
to
provide
the
four
enable
lines
of
course
the
two
low
order
bits
must
be
connected
in
parallel
to
the
four
final

decoders

that

peter
the
atari
used
a
cpu
just
like
their
entire

computers
as
well
as
the
game
machine
the
had
some
extra
asic
chips
that
were
basically
modified
graphics
chips
and
pias
for
the
joysticks
later
model
might
have
incorporated
many
of
the
chips
into
one
asci
as
the
weight
of
the
machines
and
part
count
decreased
a
lot
over
the
years
additionally
i
think
the
used
and
up
to

rom
for
their
games
i
have
no
idea
how
much
ram
it
had
to
work
with
but
i
would
hazard
a
guess
of
or
ram
think
comes
from
a
lot
of
hacking
with
the
and
computers
and
occasionally
hacking
with
the
fixing
it
for
monitor
composite
video
use
and
audio
hookups
also
i
tryed
to
make
a
cartridgeless
system
that
stored
the
rom
into
a
ram
cartridge
that
could
be
loaded
up
at
some
prior
time
a
way
to
backup
cartridges
ive
heard
of
a
setup
like
this
where
games
could
be
bought
cheaply
on
fskrecorded
tapes
then
you
would
load
them
into
a
special
ram
cartidge
and
play
them
anyways
if
youre
interested
in

weve
got
two

around

lotsa

willing

dont
play

anymore
since

oversampling

for

i
notice
that
it
proudly
proclaims
times
oversampling
on

now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont

this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
if
i
really
wanted
better
fidelity
wouldnt
i
have
to
have
the
same
higher
rate
of
sampling
during
the
recording
process
furthermore
am
i
wrong
in
interpreting
the
sampling
rate
from
the
players
point
of
view
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
data
rate
for
the
bit
stream
coming
off
the
optical
medium
does
this
mean
that
the
data
rate
related
to
the
rotational

you

hello
i
just
bought
a
new
portable
cd
player
for
the
office
and
i
notice
that
it
proudly
proclaims
times
oversampling
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
if
i
really
wanted
better
fidelity
wouldnt
i
have
to
have
the
same
higher
rate
of
sampling
during
the
recording
process
furthermore
am
i
wrong
in
interpreting
the
sampling
rate
from
the
players
point
of
view
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
data
rate
for
the
bit
stream
coming
off
the
optical
medium
does
this
mean
that
the
data
rate
related
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
disk
has
changed
since
note
i
just
tried
to
figure
this
stuff
out
about
a
month
ago
myself
from
various
people
on
the
net
so
i
could
be
wrong
the
data
is
only
ever
read
once
barring
mistracks
and
such
of
course
and
eventually
gets
turned
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete
data
points
and
interpolates
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering

only
one
grudge
the

that
hp
gives
you
does
smudge
rather
quickly
in

even
though
the

is

you
would
have

spend
about
more

the

bubblejets
are
nice

they
dont

have
as
much
support

the

also

the

is

option
for

if

food

does
anybody
out
there
have
one
of
those
food
dehydrators
ive
been
seeing
all
over
latenight
tv
recently
i
was
wondering
if
they
use
forced

hea
or
both
if
theres
heat
involved
anybody
know
what
temperature
they
run
at
my
wife
would
like
one
and
im
not
inclined
to
pay
for
a
box
a
fan
and
a
heater
seems
to
me
you
should
be
able
to
throw
a
dehydrator
together
for
just
a
few
bucks
heck
the
technology
is
only
what
years
old
you
can
learn
how
to
build
a
deyhdrator
very
easily
from
the
book
the
hungry

to
good
food
by
gretchen
mchugh
the
heat
source
is
a
watt
light
bulb
basically
its
a
vertical
wooden
box
with
ventilation
holes
in
the
top
and
bottom
lots
of
them
you
want
the
air
to
flow
the
light
bulb
goes
in
the
bottom
and
wire
cake
racks
are
spaced
every
starting
about
above
the
bulb
or
at
a
slightly
higher
cost
in
electricity
you
can
do
what
i
do

note
i
do
this
in

some

ovens
may
not

food
to
be
dried
on

tins
or
racks
in
the
oven
set
oven
to
degrees
the
lowest
setting
on
my
oven
if
yours
goes
down
to
thats
probably
even
better
stick
a
wooden
spoon
or
something
across
the
front
corner
of
the
oven
and
close
the
door
on
the
spoon
so
that
it
stays
open
about
an
inch
this
allows
for
airflow
leave
the
stuff
in
the
oven
for
to
hours
check
it
often
since
this
dries
it
much
faster
than
the
dehydrator
if
you
are
using
cookie
sheets
instead
of
racks
turn
the
stuff
over
halfway
through
if
you

i
live

francisco

and
word
has
it
that
something
similar
is
on
its
way
here
since
we
apparently
dont
have
the
sensor
base
you
folks
have
theyre
installing
cameras
at
strategic
points
along
the
freeways
initial
tests
are
going
to
be
in
the
santa
clara
area
im
told
with
the
video
being
piped
into
a
command
center
theyre
building
somewhere
in
the
east
bay
im
not
sure
if
frame
grabbers
or
cheap
labor
will
be
used
to
interpret
the
data
but
large
multicolored
status
displays
will
show
the
various
routes
using
different
colors
to
represent
the
various
average
speeds
for
each
stretch
of
highway
an
announcer
will
sit
in
front
of
the
status
wall
and
will
relay
continuous
verbal
traffic
status
to
those
who
want
to
receive
it
theyre
apparently
also
looking
into
licensing
a
lowam
frequency
to
be
dedicated
to
providing
continuous
audio
from
this
system
in
the
mean
time
theyll
set
up
large
incandescent
display
boards
along
the
test
stretch
to
provide
commuters
with
data
on
traffic
conditions
up
ahead
my
understanding
is
that
the
system
is
subsidized
as
a
pilot
program
and
information
from
it
will
be
available
free
of
charge
perhaps
the
la
system
is
similarly
free
or
provided
at
an
obviously
subsidized
rate
read
cheap
we
also
have
the
traffic
reports
that
are
broadcast
on
the
sap
audio
channel
of
television
channels
and
these
are
verbal
reports
qualified
with
a
identification
tone
to
tell
invehicle
receivers
like
the
auto
talk
that
the
information
coming
next
is
applicable
to
a
given
area
in
la
theyre
probably
using
some
other
tv
channels
but
the
concept
is
the
same
try
setting
your
stereo
tv
or
vcr
to
receive
the
sap
audio
channel
and
go
station
jumping
to
find
out
which
one
is
broadcasting
this
information
i
believe
this
program
is
also
subsidized
making
the
invehicle
receivers
cheap
to
purchase
and
without
having
to
incur
monthly
fees
to
use
it
since
the
makers
of
these
invehicle
receivers
dont
have
to
pay
for
the
broadcast
this
may
not
be
completely
true
they
likely
have
no
investment
in
keeping
the
system
up
and
running
when
the
cal
trans
stuff
hits
the
airwaves
you
may
have
a
nifty
little
tv
audio
receiver
in
your
car
nothing
more
when
this
happens
perhaps
a
word
to
the
wise
i
think
wed
all
be
interested
in
a
summary
post
if
you
get
more
info
on
how
the

system
is
networked

voltage
regulation
and
current
limiting
one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guys
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
supply
to
the
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
from
current
limited
at
voltage
must
stay
within
of
designated
value
for
i
from
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could
work
from

rules
here
are
some

on

they
dont

much

is
still
a
large
inductance
between
the

on
both
the

the

so
you
still
get

they
do
help
a
lot
with

as
i
had
with
the
high
load
on

the
transients
you
are
trying

suppress
are
really
high
frequency
so
forget
about
large

since
the

what
i
did
is
to
make

put
a

in
the
poly

allowing
frequent
contacts
i
forget
exactly
how
wide
the
poly
lines
were
if
i
were
doing
this
design
again
id
probably
omit
the
diff
altogether
and
use
a
solid
poly
sheet
instead
using
just
and
poly
and
substrate
but
that
has
such
a
high
resistance
it
can
be
ignored
at
these

you
are
probably
better
off
trying

tune
your

to
run
with
slightly
slower
edges
and
lower

swings
especially
for

signalling
than
spending

you

something
on
a

ups
well
on
ours
anyway
there
is
no
switchover
from
ac
to
dc
all
the
protected
equipment
is
always
running
from
the
batteries
via
an
inverter
with
the
usual
condition
of
also
having
them
on

if
the

fails
big

the
computers
never
see
it
until
the
batteries
start
to
droop
but
theres
something
like
carsized
batteries
in
that
cabinet
so
it
takes
a
while
if
you
were
gonna
run
the
guts
on
straight
dc
instead
of
an
inverter
why
not
do
it
all
the
time
then
thered
be
no
switchover
to
screw
things
up
and
no
having
to
sense
the
failure
fast
just
keep
the
dc
on
charge
when
the
power
is
on
and
itll
be
there
in
zero
time
when
you
need
it
actually
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
thati
sounds
to
me
your
ups
takes
in
ac
rectifies
it
to
dc
to
charge
the
batteries
and
then
takes
the
battery
dc
and
chops
it
to
ac
again
feeding
your
equipment
this
approach
is
the
easiest
and
cleanest
way
to
switchover
from
the
mains
to
battery
once
your
power
kicks
out
since
as
you
mentioned
nothing
will
know
about
what
happened
down
the
line
another
way
to
do
the
ups
scheme
is
to
use
the
mains
until
you
lose
power
and
then
kick
in
the
battery
backup
with
its
inverter
to
replace
the
lost
power
the
problem
here
is
the
switchover
time
and
youve
got
to
resync
the
ac
in
no
time

thats
a
standby

a

there
would

morgan

mjbbuxacsouiucedu
unfortunately
most
everything
is

the

i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate

exceeds
the

by

factor
i
dont

could
someone

whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
the
data
is
only
ever
read
once
barring
mistracks
and
such
of
course
and
eventually
gets
turned
into
khz
bit
two
channel
data
oversampling
takes
two
discrete
data
points
and
interpolates
points
between
them
for
n
times
oversampling
when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
understanding
the
filtering
is
not
interpolation
as
that
would
distort
the
frequency
content
of
the
signal
you
are
listening
to
generally
these
players
run
the
samples
thru
an
allpass
filter
network
i
have
done
this
for
ecg
waveforms
from
a
persons
heart
and
the
effect
is
rather
spooky
it
actually
reconstructs
peaks
that
werent
there
correctly
too
and
fills
in
the
gaps
with
the
properly
computed
values
just
as
if
there
had
been
a
real
sample
taken
at
that
point
i
use
a
cpu
to
do
all
the
math
it
takes
a
decent
but
not
unreasonable
amount
of
cpu
time
to
do
this
you
can
keep
up
with
things
in
realtime
if
you
write
efficient
code
in
case
you
care
the
filtering
method
uses
an
fir
finite
impulse
response
filter
id
guess
that
cd
makers
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybody
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tapped
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weighting
to
accomplish
the
filtering
this
strikes
me
as
the
most
cost
effective
method
for
volume
production
runs
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering
actually
i
think
the
only
reason
they
do
this
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
marketting
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acutally
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampled
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
components
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
its
too
bad
that
they
charge
more
for
something
that
i
think
is
actually
less
costly
to
build
i
seriously
doubt
that
the
filters
cost
the
same
but
are
better
they
are
built
to
a
price
spec
and
that
spec

cheap

tony
pink
noise
is
a
random
signal
with
more
lowfrequency
components
than
white
noise
if
you
look
at
the
frequency
spectrum
of
white
noise
at
a
frequency
analyzer
you
will
find
that
the
spectrum
power
density
is
flat
which
means
that
every
frequency
is
present
in
the
noise
signal
often
pink
noise
is
obtained
from
white
noise
by
integrating
of
lowpass
filtering
a
white
noise
signal
therefore
pink
noise
contains
much
more
lowfrequency
components
the
effect
of
pink

is
sometimes
used

oversampling
takes

points

for
n
times

when
i
asked
people
said
that
the
interpolation
was
not
simply
linear
interpolation
but
significantly
more
complicated
you
are
quite
correct
in
your
understanding
the
filtering
is
not
interpolation
as
that
would
distort
the
frequency
content
of
the
signal
they
do
interpolate
its
not
linear
interpolation
though
you
are
correct
that
the
frequency
content
is
not
altered
more
specifically
the
baseband
spectrum
is
preserved
and
so
is
every
nth
image
spectrum
the
other
in
n
image
spectra
are
removed
where
n
is
the
oversampling
rate
you
are

generally
these
players
run
the
samples
thru
an
allpass

network
i
have
done
this
for
ecg
waveforms
from
a
persons
ideally
the
filter
has
a
gain
of
from

and
a
gain
of
from
to
the
new
nyquist
frequency
in
practice
a

is

there
is
also
a

about
observations

filter
at

in
case
you
care
the
filtering
method
uses
an

finite
impulse
response
filter
id
guess
that
cd
makers
use
the
same
kind
of
method
anybody
out
there
know
the
real
answer
id
say
that
they
use
a
tapped
delay
line
with
resistoropamp
weighting
to
accomplish
the
filtering
this
strikes
me
as
the
most
cost
effective
method
for
volume
production
runs
no
they
actually
use
a
digital
fir
just
like
yours
but
built
in
hardware
on
custom
vlsi
chips
for
mainly
economic
reasons
anyway
then
the
purpose
of
oversampling
is
to
move
the
effective
sampling
rate
up
to
n
times
khz
in
order
to
use
higher
frequency
antialiasing
filters
for
the
same
quality
filter
higher
oversampling
lets
you
build
cheaper
filters
whereas
for
the
same
price
filter
higher
oversamplings
lets
you
build
better
filters
so
assuming
the
quality
of
all
other
components
in
a
cd
player
remained
the
same
oversampling
should
allow
a
manufacturer
to
produce
slightly
better
sound
due
to
antialias
filtering
actually
i
think
the
only
reason
they
do
this
is
so
that
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
marketting
gimic
i
would
guess
that
it
is
acutally
cheaper
to
filter
an
oversampled
signal
than
not
you
can
use
sloppier
components
and
give
the
filter
a
rolloff
that
isnt
so
sharp
its
too
bad
that
they
charge
more
for
something
that
i
think
is
actually
less
costly
to
build
i
guess
that
the
answer
is
somewhere
between
the
two

interesting

how
does
the
radio
electronics
free
information
cards
work
do
they
just
send
you
some
general
information
about
the
companies
that
advertise
in
their
magazine
or
does
it
also
give
you
sign
you
up
for
a
catalog
that
depends
entirely
upon
the
advertiser
whose
number
you
circled
radio
electronics
compiles
all
of
the
cards
then
each
advertiser
gets
a
computer
printout
of
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
of
the
readers
who
circled
their
number
some
magazines
also
provide
the
data
on
selfadhesive
labels
and
the
really
big
magazines
provide
the
data
on
computer
disk
the
advertiser
decides
what
to
do
with
the
data
they
get
you
will
notice
that
the
radio
electronics
information
card
commonly
called
a
bingo
card
in
the
industry
includes
lines
for
a
company
name
and
a
business
phone
number
my
guess
would
be
that
the
big
national
advertisers
make
a
distinction
between
hobbiests
and
professionals
as
best
they
can
for
example
if
you
include
motorola
as
your
company
and
include
a
business
phone
and
a
mail
stop
tektronics
will
probably
send
you
a
copy
of
their
hardbound
catalog
and
have
a
sales
engineer
call
you
about
a
week
later
if
you
leave
it
blank
odds
are
they
will
send
you
a
slick
brochure
and
direct
you
to
a
local
retail
outlet
medium
and
small
companies
are
more
likely
to
send
you
th
e
whole
catalog
and
then
some
companies
like
digikey
or
jameco
have
nothing
to
mail
out
accept
the
catalog
a
couple
of
other
interesting
points
about
bingo
cards
free
industry
magazines
like
edn
and
such
also
log
your
card
to
their
computer
they
use
the
information
at
least
three
ways
they
note
that
you
really
do
read
the
magazine
and
are
more
likely
to
continue
your
subscription
or
push
you
through
repeated
mailings
to
resubscribe
they
also
compile
how
many
people
requested
which
data
for
their
marketing
demographics
this
way
thay
can
tell
a
prospective
advertiser
that
of
readers
requesting
data
were
interested
in
capacitors
and
finally
some
magazines
rent
lists
of
readers
who
request
certain
information
for
example
tektronics
can
rent
a
list
of
everyone
who
requested
information
about
test
equipment
other
than
tektronics
in
the
past
months
the
other
point
in
the
data
the
advertiser
receives
many
magazines
include
how
many
items
you
circled
on
the
card
if
they
want
the
advertiser
can
attempt
to
cull
out
the
literature
collectors
from
the
serious
potential
customers
can
you
say
qualified
sales
leads
i
thought
you
could
whats
the
best
way
for
a
hobbiest
to
deal
with
bingo
cards
never
circle
more
than
number
on
the
card
if
you
want
more
than
items
use
the
second
card
and
mail
it
a
couple
of
weeks
later
if
you
are
really
really
serious
and
you
really
really
want
the
information
call
the
advertiser
and
ask
this
will
also
cut
about
days
off
the
the
response
time
virtually
everyone
takes
a
voice
on
the
phone
more
seriously
than

to
help
insure
you
keep
getting
a
trade

that
youre
not
really
qualified
for

in

at

copy

only
serves
one
pur
pose
to
keep
the
honest
buyer
from
making
legal
backup
copies
it
will
definitely
not
stop
any
pirates
if
you
want
to
protect
you
soft
supply
a
good
documentation
and
support
this
is
imho
the
only
way
of
effectively
protecting
software
there
are
several
types
of
copy
protection
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
using
a
legitimate
copy
the
simplest
and
virtually
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixate
itself
to
the
machine
it
was
installed
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatever
so
a
copy
put
on
a
different
machine
not
installed
from
original
disks
will
not
work
the
program
is
definitely
backupable
if
restored
to
the
same
machine
depends
on
the
programmer
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characteristic
if
the
user
did
an
upgrade
to
the
machine
heshe
should
reinstall
all
programs
any
way
no
document
lookup
no

wearandtear
i
did
not
say
that
the
originals
would
allow
only
one
install
the
users
conscience
should
do
that
i
know
ill
get
flamed
for
this
but
with
the
increasing
number
of
casual
users
who
either
unknowingly
or
dont
care
about
the
software
copyrights
its
the
truth
i
have
friends
who
ask
me
for
copies
of
my
latest
games
all
the
time
and
when
i
refused
they
went
after
somebody
else
casual
pirating
is
becoming
more
of
a
problem
some
sort
of
copy
protection
will
discourage
the
casual
copying
ive
seen
what
some
of
my
friends
dug
up
somewhere
latest
and
the
greatest
games
all
cracked
within
days
of
actual
release
you
know
how
many
bytes
you
need
to
change
in
xwing
to
disable
the
quiz
two
yes
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
ones
they
are
determined
pirates
are
unstoppable
given
enough
time
but
their
results
do
not
spread
that
far
since
pirate
boards
are
not
that
wellknown
and
easily
tracked
once
found
by
authorities
it
is
the
casual
pirates
that
the
copy
protection
is
determined
to
discourage
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out

uh
oh
umm
there
are
a
number
of
copy
protection
schemes
some
involve
modifying
the
physical
media
and
some
involve
encryption
schemes
c
all
of
the
ones
that
have
existed
over
the
course
of
computing
have
been
successful
for
a
time
i
recall
however
near
monthly
releases
of
new
ways
to
crack
the
copy
protection
scheme
of
the
latest
releases
the
fact
is
none
of
them
are
completely
secure
or
anywhere
near
it
some
are
more
or
less
difficult
to
crack
and
some
have
already
been
cracked
i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
question
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
answer
what
exactly
do
you
want
to
know
do
you
need
a
good
one
for
a
project
you
are
working
on
how
secure
must
it
be
are
you
trying
to
crack
one
that
someone
else
has
used
i
can
probably
make
suggestions
assuming
the
activity
is
strictly
legal
in
general
it
is
a
bad
idea
legally
to
tamper
with
copy
protection
it
can
also
lead
to
corruption
of
files
which
you
necessarily
do
not
have
back
ups
of
being
as
they
are
copy
protected
which
can
be
devestating
do
you
have
absolutely
no
ideas
for
practical
applications
and
are
merely
curious
please
clear
up
those
questions
and
ill
try
to
help
as
much
as
i
can
incidentally
the
uh
oh
at
the
top
is
indicative
of
the
dread
anyone
who
has
watched
their
friends
hacking
equipment
be
carted
off
feels
when
they
are
asked
how
to
hack
the
area
you
are
broaching
is
wrought
with
dangers
many
of
which
include
breaking
the
law
or
at
least
addressing
it
from
one
side
or
the
other
matt
i
have
written
a
program
and
i
want
to
market
it
i
would
like
certain
degree
of
protection
since
my
main
custmers
are
individuals
and
not
the
cooperations
i
know
laser
hole
burning
method
and
hardware
key
method
however
my
software
is
going
to
cost
only
so
i
can
not
afford
that
also
at
this
low
price
i
can
not
afford
people
make
too
many
copy
of
my
software
well
i
guess
say
upto
illigal
copying
is
ok
by
me
however
i
do
not
want
someone
to
get
a
copy
of
pctools
and
copy
my
software
off
course
i
never
meant
to
forbid
the
true
hackers
from
copying
since
they
can
develope
a
better
program
anyway
with
highest
regards
babak
sehari
one
of
the
most
popular
methods
of
course
is
the
password
check
where
they
ask
you
for
a
word
from
page
x
line
y
and
word
z
but
this
is
pitifully
simple
to
remove
unless
you
throw
some
checksums
into
the
main
part
of
your
program
and
some
selfrewriting
code
to
confuse
some
people
also
make
sure
that
your
program
can
not
be
run
out
a
debugger
another
method
of
course
is
to
not
even
make
bad
sectors
on
the
original
disk
just
write
a
certain
key
to
a
certain
unallocated
sector
to
help
you
here
you
also
must
do
the
code
protection
schemes
mentioned
in
the
first
paragraph
make
sure
you
also
fill
the
rest
of
the
unallocated
parts
of
the
disk
with
garbage
as
well
or
they
wanna
be
crackers
can
just
look
for
the
junk
in
some
random
sector
like
you
mentioned
there
are
the
laser
holed
disks
and
hardware
keys
but
they
are
both
expensive
and
a
pain
in
the
butt
for
the
enduser
which
you
is
the
opposite
of
what
you
want
another
configuration
that
can
be
used
is
to
save
the
configuration
of
the
machine
that
it
is
being
installed
to
in
the
most
undecipherable
format
you
can
think
of
if
the
program
does
not
find
that
this
is
the
same
system
it
requests
being
installed
by
the
original
disk
again
the
original
disk
should
be
encrypted
compacted
have
many
sectors
that
should
be
checked
and
anything
else
you
can
think
of
to
make
sure
that
the
original
cannot
be
copied
once
again
you
must
put
codeencryption
selfrewriting
code
and
multiple
crc
checks
in
the
program
to
make
sure
that
it
does
not
get
changed
among
other
things
this
also
protects
your
program
from
virii
if
the
program
detects
a
change
in
its
code
tell
the
user
that
a
virus
has
been
detected
in
the
program
tell
them
the
program
is
virus
secure
and
remember
you
have
helped
the
world
kill
some
pirating
and
kill
some
viruses
feel
good
i
hope
that
i
have
helped
have
fun
knock
some
cracking
out
well
you
cant
do
it
everything
that
can
be
written
can
be

youll
pissem

im
wondering
if
its
possible
to
use
radio
waves
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
transmitters
and
receiver
yes
its
called
radar
well
actually
not
quite
both
radar
and
radioaltimeters
measure
distances
by
measuring
the
time
required
to
transmit
a
signal
then
receive
its
reflection
from
a
target
radar
generally
uses
pulses
while
radio
altimeters
use
either
pulses
or
a
modulated
continuouswave
transmission
in
the
case
of
the
latter
highly
accurate
distance
measurement
can
be
made
as
an
example
the
original
bendix
radio
altimeter
was
accurate
to
foot
at
feet
altitude
note
however
that
this
is
a
different
method
of
measuring
than
the
poster
originally
asked
about
the
problem
with
gaining
accurate
measurements
between
a
transmitter
and
a
seperate
receiver
is
that
you
need
a
highly
accurate
time
base
which
starts
at
the
receiver
at
the
exact
instant
the
transmitter
triggers
this
cannot
be
wire
connected
since
radio
waves
will
actually
travel
faster
in
freespace
air
in
this
case
than
wire
the
difference
is
called
the
velocity
factor
of
the
cable
so
you
need
to
resort
to
a
common
timebase
that
is
automatically
corrected
for
distance
etc
something
like
a
pll
connected
to
a
gps
receiver
should
do
the
trick
triggering
both
the
transmitter
and
receiver
simultaneously
sound
expensive
not
too
bad
but
plan
on
spending
a
few
bucks
in
both
equipment
and
effort
why
not
go
to
a
different
method
surveyors
use
a
laserlight
system
where
again
the
reflection
time
is
measured
why
not
try
this
sounds
like
something
a
pe
should
know
about
anyway
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
this
is
actually
highly
inaccurate
since
the
power
output
of
a
transmitter
varies
from
unit
to
unit
there
are
variances
in
the
antenna
and
transmission
line
and
the
receiver
may
also
vary
both
from
unit
to
unit
and
the
same
unit
over
time
you
would
need
to
continuously
calibrate
the
entire
system
with
the
radio
altimeter
this
is
also
done
but
since
everything
is
located
at
one
place
it
is
much
easier
to
do
note
especially
that
the
time
base
for
the
ra
receiver
and
transmitter
is
one
unit
also
depends
on
the
environment
in
a
static
environent
such
as
a
waveguide
yes
in
a
dynamic
environment
with
objects
moving
about
the
multipath
kills
this
concept
nope
fm
capture
effect
says
that
the
strongest
signal
wins
that
is
unless
the
two
interfering
signals
are
seperated
by
more
than
db
in
signal
strength
this
is
the
one
problem
that
makes
altimeters
inaccurate
at
very
low
altitudes
signals
bouncing
off
runways
tend
to
be
very
strong
what
frequencies
would
be
best
for
this
or
does
matter
as
high
as
possible
to
eliminate
outside
influence
and
also
to
enhance
attenuation
of
multipath
signals
radio
altimeters
typically
use
frequencies
around
ghz
hope
this

there
are
several
types
of
copy
protection
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
using
a
legitimate
copy
the
simplest
and
virtually
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixate
itself
to
the
machine
it
was
installed
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatever
so
a
copy
put
on
a
different
machine
not
installed
from
original
disks
will
not
work
okay
so
what
do
you
do
if
some
part
of
the
machine
presumably
the
part
on
which
the
code
number
or
whatever
that
the
program
has
fixated
itself
upon
goes
bad
you
replace
that
part
and
now
your
program
wont
run
because
its
on
a
different
computer
this
is
of
course
assuming
that
the
program
uses
something
in
rom
like
the
bios
serial
number
maybe
and
not
a
diskbased
code
number
obviously
if
the
drive
goes

youll
be
reinstalling
the

anyway
i
work
in
a
computer
lab
which
is
part

university
microlab
system
we
have
the
wonderfully
fun
task
of
maintaining
well
over
a
hundred
machines
both
pc
and
macintosh
as
well
as
administering
a
network

over
next
machines

personally

copyprotection
schemes
of
any
sort
are
nothing
more
than
a

headache
for
the

anyone
who
wants
a
copy
of
your
program
and
doesnt
care
about
legality
will
get
a

board
or
no

board
i
too
have
friends
who
blatantly
and
quite
successfuly
hack
copy
protection
schemes
practically
in
their
sleep
lets
consider
what
goes
on
in
our
lab
almost
daily
we
have
at
least
one
machine
down
sometimes
several
due
to
some
goofball
screwing
up
some
setting
or
other
on
a
piece
of
software
admittedly
we
being
students
mostly
are
not
the
worlds
most
efficient
and
effective
network
administrators
but
we
try
keeping
even
the
twenty
machines
that
are
partly
my
responsibility
even
vaguely
looking
and
acting
similar
to
the
average
user
and
maintaining
behindthescenes
consistency
is
a
real
headache
but
not
so
bad
a
headache
as
trying
to
remember
twenty
different
folder
locations
of
norton
utilities
when
some
guy
trashes
his
disk
often
we
have
hardware
problems
at
peak
business
times
and
have
to
do
some
partsswapping
to
get
stuff
working
temporarily
well
ill
cut
to
the
chase
and
quit
boring
yall
the
point
is
often
we
have
to
reinstall
software
and
copy
configuration
files
etc
from
machine
to
machine
by
far
the
easiest
way
we
have
found
to
do
this
is
to
get
one
machine
working
exactly
the
way
we
want
to
then
copy
the
complete
setup
of
this
machine
to
the
other
nine
of
that
machines
type
this
ensures
us
that
for
at
least
ten
minutes
we
have
ten
identical
machines
to
work
with
having
them
networked
simplifies
this
considerably
as
our
major
packages
wordperfect
windows
etc
are
all
network
versions
and
thus
only
one
copy
to
mess
with
often
however
we
need
to
install
a
package
requested
by
some
instructor
to
one
some
or
all
of
the
machines
for
a
special

this
is
usually
a
handwritten

its
sort

will
get

you
will
only
be

their

do
not
spread

since
pirate

are
not

the
casual

that
the

i

the

implement
the

once
the

registers
that
loudly
exclaims

registered

xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the

two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
this
way
the
legitimate

who
does
not
register
will
experience
minimal
discomfort
who
does
major
upgrades
to
their
computer
frequently
as
only
problem
they
have
is
they
wont
be
able
to
restore
to
another

the
registered

would
have
proven
they
are
legitmate
users
and
therefore
gains
full
rights
and
can
restore

on
the
other
hand

this

why
does
a

discharge

totally
unuseable

stored

i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
thanks
i
am
not
a
battery
expert
but
from
recent
reading
a
lead
acid
battery
will
self
discharge
at
a
relatively
high
rate
and
if
stored
in
a
discharged
state
will
develop
a
condition
i
think
is
called
sulfation
in
storage
either
the
electrolyte
should
be
removed
and
replaced
for
use
fat
chance
id
ever
do
that
at
home
or
the
battery
should
be
stored
on
a
trickle
charge
i
have
also
i
think
read
that
the
condition
may
be
reversable
if
hooked
up
to
a
current
limited
charging
circuit
fro
a
long
period
of
time
the
refernce
i
remember
is
to
use
where
c
is
the
amp
hours
as
the
charging
circuit
and
leave
it
hooked
up
for
weeks
some
of
this
may
only
apply
to

i
suspect
the

applies
to

is
at

ive
got

out
when
im
stuck
to
each
his

off
deeper
end
why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the
hard
disk
so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your
backups
i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the
backups
weve
destroyed
about
six
sets
of
original
microsoft
word
for

and
word
for

may
have
been
a
bad
batch
of

dont
have
the
faintest
idea
what
happened
to
them
they
just
went
bad
werent
stored
near
any
magnetic
fields
or
otherwise
mistreated
indeed
they
were
only
used
once
given
this
and
the
massive
headaches
finding
a
working
set
of
disks
to
fix
some
of
the
machines
that
periodically
go
down
id
say
having
working
backups
is
a
godsend
i
sure
wish
wed
had
them
sometimes
i
think
murphys
law
holds
true
more
often
than
newtons
when
we
needed
them
i
think
its
sortof
like
snake
antivenin
of
the
time
you
have
absolutely
no
use
for
it
but
when
you
need
it
boy
do
you
ever
need
it
i
dont
have
backups
of
my
originals
at
home
but
then
my
machine
doesnt
see
anywhere
near
the
useabuse
of
these
here
at
the
lab
and
so
i
consider
it
less
of
a
risk
still
i
usually
make
working
copies
of
them
when
i
install
them
and
then
eventually
reuse

this
took
all

time
during

there
was
also
a
standard

io
timer
riot
plus
a

if
memory
serves
a

thats
all
the
ram
was
mapped

the

a
zeropage
addressing

both
shorter

faster
than
the

so
it
is
important
on
a
machine
like
this
to
have
the
scratchpad
ram

unfortunately
it
also
wants
its

the

the

bit
timer
with
a

i
think
this
was
some
power
of
there
were
no
interrupts
in
the
system
so
many
games
would
set
up
the
timer
at
some
known
time
go
away
and
do
something
else
for
a
while
then
sit

wait

there
was
no

in

the

had
at

probably
one

one

i
imagine
the

was
much
the

various

were
fed
directly

i
think
its
because
the
lead
gets
coated
with
lead
oxide
if
the
battery
is
not
being
charged
or
discharged
i
remember
some
advice
from
an
ancient
car
manual
guide
my
father
had
which
was
to
use
car
batteries
to
power
a
garage
clock
or
something
similar
when
theyre
not
in
a
car
this
is
supposed
to
prevent
the
oxidation
but
ive
no
idea
if
it
really
works
the
concrete
floor
connection
is
a
red
herring
it
could
be
that
you
stored
it
somewhere
that
it
could
become
covered
by
moisture
or
damp
air
which
would
short
out
the
terminals
this
may
contribute
to
discharging
but
would
be
reversible
the
same
thing
happens
to
my
car
citroen
damp
gets
under
the
bonnet
us
hood
and
shorts
the
sparkplugs
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solution
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
leads
and
spray
with
moisture
repellant
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
storing
the
well
this
is
offtopic
but
back
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
drive
bangers
i
never
found
to
do
anything
that
wiping
with
a
dry
cloth
didnt
do
i
think
the
effectiveness
of
is
a
myth
invented
by
the
guy
who
owns
the
company
battery
off

may

im
not

if
spraying
with

that
circuits
are
there
any
companies
that
specialize
in
selling

that
are
no

i
have

several

without
any
success
i
would
appreciate
if
you
could
give

in

where

are
dead
if
the

is
no
good
i
insist

you
never

question
on

i
have
a
question
about
accessing
certain
addresses
on
a
chip
particulary
a
eprom
although
i
dont
know
that
much
about
it
as
i
understand
it
theres
a
pin
on
the
chip
that
when
voltage
is
applied
kicks
up
the
address
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
how
many
bytes
the
address
is
incremented
by
for
example
if
i
have
code
i
want
to
be
accessed
at
and
also
at
say
how
do
i
move
the
address
pointer
to
those
positions

wish
to

on
the
subject
of
warmrunning
amplifiers
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
an
amp
that
runs
hot
has
no
bearing
on
how
its
gonna
sound
the
amp
you
have
probably
is
running
classa
the
whole
day
because
either
the
engineer
or
manufacturer
of
that
amp
wanted
to
skimp
on
heatsinking
or
cooling
to
save
costs
hmmmmm
there
is
a
correclation
between
warmrunning
amps
and
good
sound
or
in
your
words
it
does
have
a
bearing
on
now
i
dont
suggest
that
everyone
run
out
and
create
combination
stoveamplifiers
that
will
degrade
lifespan
but
a
coldrunning
circuit
is
much
more
suceptible
to
temperature
variation
with
varrying
current
than
is
a
warmrunning
one
and
since
junction
resistance
is
a
function
of
temperature
this
has
a
detrimental
effect
on
linearity
a
few
facts
bias
points
vary
with
temperature
junction
resist
varrie
with
temp
adcom
products
do
not
run
classa
if
you
still
dont
beleive
this
assertion
consider
the
warmup
requirements
for
most
good
test
equipment
or
better
yet
just
listen
to
an

warmup

i
built
a
little
project
using
the
radio
shack
relays
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretty
bad
clicks
when
the
thing
switched
i
was
doing
most
of
the
common
things
one
is
supposed
to
do
when
using
relays
and
nothing
seemed
to
get
rid
of
the
clicks
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switching
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
noise
of
any
kind
on
the
audio
lines
i
will
appreciate
any
advice
or
references
to
advice
also
exact
part
numberscompany
names
etc
for
the
relays
will
help
the
first
step
is
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
dc
component
intentional
or
not
on
the
audio
lines
to
be
switched
if
neither
the
output
or
input
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
lets
say
theyre
capacitively
coupled
then
putting
a
k
resistor
from
each
input
to
ground
and
from
the
output
to
ground
is
a
good
precaution
against
leakage
in
any
coupling
caps
presenting
a
dc
level
that
is
guaranteed
to
cause
a
click
if
the
device
presents
an
unintentional
dc
level
that
is
from
more
than
just
coupling
capacitor
leakage
then
you
need
to
remove
the
dc
before
switching
with
coupling
capacitors
of
your
own
if
you
have
more
than
one
relay
each
relay
switching
one
input
through
to
a
common
output
you
can
use
makebeforebreak
switching
where
for
a
brief
instant
both
sources
are
connected
during
a
switch
change
this
may
mask
the
switch
click
an
audio
switch
that
is
clickless
is
made
by
taking
a
light
bulb
and
making
your
own
ersatz
optoisolator
with
a
lightdependent
resistor
ldr
sealed
inside
a
piece
of
black
heatshrink
many
broadcast
consoles
use
this
older
but
timehonored
technique
claro
actually
makes
a
complete
optisolator
like
this
but
i
dont
have
a

a

grabbag
you
might
want
to
try
for
a
simple
solid
state
clickless
switch
that
is
cheap
you
might
try
looking
at
the
analog
switch
that
is
commonly
available
or
its
older
predecessor
the
again
the
dc
component
must
be
removed
prior
to
switching
other
alternatives
include
jfet
switches
both
discrete
and
ic
and
diode
switching
which
works
relatively
well
surprisingly
all
the
above
with
their
pitfalls
and
application
tips
could
easily
make
a
subject
for
a
multipage
article
solid
state
switches
may
induce
a
click
of
their
own
when
turned
on
due
to
charge
being
injected
into
the
audio
line
through
device
capacitance
when
the
control
signal
changes
state
techniques
to
minimize
this
include
lowering
the
impedance
of
the
signal
paths
through
the
switch
differential
switching
and
slowing
the
risetime
of
the
control
pulse
with
the
cutting
the
click
can
be
as
simple
as
putting
resistors
in

with
the
control
pins

my

was
a
dismal
failure
i
used
compariators
each
compariator
had
the

one

the

went
to
a

created

the

was
that
the

was
way
too
slow
i
needed
to
get
several

before
it
would
fire
the

so
i
could
have
a
whole

full

my
the
second
problem
is
that
there
was
more
noise
on
the
reference
then
the
smallest
difference
between
a
blank

the
difference

replace

we

from
current
limited
at
voltage
must
stay
within

for
i
from
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
of
course
we
cant
just
use
an
adjustable
voltage
currentlimiting
regulator
chip
our
problem
is
with
the
current
limiting
ie
weve
found
stuff
to
do
the
rest
of
the
parts
of
the
circuit
what
the
supply
must
do
if
presented
with
a
load
which
would
draw
more
than
given
the
supply
voltage
is
reduce
the
voltage
so
that
the
current
will
equal
one
amp
thus
if
we
were
to
short
the
thing
with
the
ammeter
we
should
read
one
amp
if
we
measure
the
current
through
a
ohm
resistor
at
we
should
read
one
amp
and
the
output
voltage
by
necessity
must
be
the
only
basic
idea
we
have
seen
for
the
current
limiter
involves
a
circuit
which
will
pull
current
off
of
the
base
of
the
output
power
transistor
and
therefore
reduce
the
output
so
does
anybody
have
any
ideas
we
could

from

you
need

gain
on

normally
a

will
be

for

use
an

not

no

there
a

could
it
be
that
the

have
not

about

juha
the

filled
fiberglass

teflon

evolved
more

demands
were
made

first
boards
were

most

today
are
fiberglass
the

use
and
cost
boards
in
satellite

microwave
communication
are
teflon
and
ceramic
as
the
fiberglass

other

are
conductive
they
actually
work
more

what
i
believe
the

should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a

once
the

city

and
disables
the

two
benefits

cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
you
take
two
copies
with
a
different
registration
id
compare
them
byte
for
byte
and
you
know
where
they
are
located
usually
you
will
be
able

find
out
what
is
what
after
that
probably

the
point
is
the
company
make
the

patch
not
you
sure
you
can
probably
find
another

compare
notes

why
its
not

you
in

way

you
are

something
nothing
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggestion
im
saying
that
you
register
via
mail
by
mailing
in
your
registration
card
then
the
company
send
you
the
patch
which
includes
the
info
you
put

kasey

im
glad
to
see
this

come
up

in

what
if
you
had
an

key
that
computed
from
the
name
and
address
data
when
the

registers
you
dont
even
need

the

you

can

a

anyone
know
where
i
can
find
such

even
a

si
dac
would

needless

i

wearandtear
this
is
not
a
good

i
upgraded
my
motherboard
last
fall
i
would
have
been
quite
pissed
at
any
software
that
would
have
forced
me
to
reinstall
simply
because
i
changed
motherboards
opinion
is
understandable
i
assume
you
have
a
tape
drive
not
all
of
us
have
about
floppies
around
for
backup
you
know
any
info
in
the
bios
is
too
volatile
to
use
as
a
checksum
are
you
going
to
require
that
a
user
reinstall
all
their
software
if
they
add
of
ram
to
their
computer
i
did
that
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
its
in
the
bios
and
if
software
had
told
me
this
isnt
the
machine
you
installed
me
on
i
would
never
have
used
that
software
again
really
bad
idea
ram
is
something
you
add
all
the
time
so
no
its
more
like
bios
manufacturer
andor
processor
type
data
cannot
be
used
esp
with
these
new
flash
rom
bios
machines
with
updates
on
a
diskette
on
the
other
hand
to
make
this
less
intrusive
it
could
be
disguised
as
please
insert
original
disk
xx
as
i
need
file
yyyyyy
for
update
it
would
be
perfectly
reasonable
sort
of
i
did
not
say
that
the
originals
would
allow
only
one
install
the
users
conscience
should
do
that
this
is
silly
its
much
easier
to
loan
disks
to
a
friend
and
let
them
do
an
install
than
to
backup
your
copy
already
on
disk
and
then
give
them
that
your
scheme
isnt
going
to
stop
anyone
of
course
it
is
easier
are
you
saying
then
the
originals
should
allow
only
one
install
what
is
your
point
you
know
how
many
bytes
you
need
to
change
in
xwing
to
disable
the
quiz
two
yes
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
ones
they
are
do
you
know
any
assembly
language
at
all
all
anyone
needs
to
do
if
find
the
part
of
the
code
that
does
the
quiz
and
insert
a
jmp
instruction
to
just
completely
skip
it
not
that
difficult
really
and
there
is
very
little
that
commpanies
can
do
to
stop
this
type
of
thing
using
pklite
or
some
similar
utility
would
help
but
only
if
the
resulting
compressed
exe
were
tagged
as
uncompressable
i
know
and
assembly
quite
well
thank
you
i
know
exactly
which
two
bytes
need
to
be
changed
i
have
the
code
to
do
them
too
i
just
said
dont
ask
me
which
ones
i
didnt
say
i
dont
know
what
that
means
such
hacking
can
be
easily
discouraged
by
adding
antipatching
code
which
does
a
selfcheck
upon
execution
and
refuse
to
load
if
crc
does
not
match
value
stored
encrypted
of
course
in
the
program
it
could
be
claimed
as
a
part
of
antivirus
code
and
it
would
not
be
far
from
the
truth
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
this
is
by
far
the
best
idea
you
presented
in
your
post
making
it
plainly
obvious
who
registered
is
going
to
stop
casual
pirates
but
the
determined
ones
are
just
going
to
answer
joe
blow
to
the
question
of
whats
your
name
so
this
wont
stop
them
in
the
long
run
did
anyone
read
what
i
wrote
that
is
not
what
i
wrote
or
meant
what
i
said
was
the
program
should
have
certain
restriction
such
as
the
restricttoonemachine
until
the
program
is
registered
with
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
will
then
supply
the
thenprovenlegitimateuser
with
a
patch
that
will
disable
the
restriction
and
proudly
proclaim
the
legal
copy
with
the
registered
to
xxx
screen
pirates
are
always
going
to
win
this
fight
they
simply
have
more
time
to
work
on
the
software
and
figure
out
the
protection
scheme
of
course
they
will
but
that
was
not
my
point
the
purpose
of
copy
protection
is
to
discourage
casual
pirates
oh
can
i
have
a
copy
of
thatsure
here
and
the
less
sophisticated
pirates
lets
look
for
all
those
calls
to
any
one
determined
enough
to
break
copy
protection
can
and
will
succeed
they
can
always
backtrace
the
entire
loadsequence
of
the
program
the
point
of
copy
protection
is
to
make
such
attempts
take
as
long
as
possible
while
not
intruding
upon
the
uses
or
to
minimize
such
intrusion
of
legitimate
use
pirates
who
see
copy
protection
as
a
challenge
love
breaking
them
and
no
amount
of
copy
protection
will
stop
them
but
the
rest
of

will
be

many

i
asked
a

said
that
you

never

it

he
couldnt
tell
me
why
this
topic
was
beaten
to
death
a
year
or
so
ago
the
concrete
is
not
the
problem
leadacid
batteries
often
fail
from
disuse
not
being
charged
for
a
long
time
but
theres
no
way
the
concrete
floor
could
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
the
concrete
floor
accelerates
the
problem
because
it
is
a
heat
sink
and
a
colder
leadacid
battery
selfdischarges
at
a
slightly
faster
rate
thats
why
the
old
wives
tale
of
sitting
it
on
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
floor
works
to
help
keep
from
killing
the
battery
as
fast
it
insulates
the
battery
thermally
it
youll
set
the
battery
down
on
a
piece
of
styrofoam
it
will
selfdischarge
even
slower
the
best
thing
would
be
to
attach
a
small
load
such
as
a
small
transistor
radio
with
the
volume
turned
down
low
and
leave
it
on
constantly
but
also
tricklecharge
it
every
couple
days
too
to
shallow
cycle
the
charge
in
the
battery
such
mild
exercising
of
a
leadacid
battery
is
the
next
best
thing
to
completely
removing
the
electrolyte
for
storage
if
you
do
remove
the
electrolyte
may
sure
you
keep
separate
storage
containers
for
each
cells
electrolyte
and
put
it
back
into
the
same
cells
when
you
refill
the
battery
this
isnt
so
critical
for
a
brandnew
battery
in
a
fully
charged
state
but
will
maximize
the
restored
output
of
an
older
battery
which
may
not
be
fully
charged
when
you
remove
the
electrolyte
for

why
does
everyone
think
they
need
to
be
able
to
make
a
backup
copy
almost
all
new
software
must
be
installed
to
the

so
you
are
left
with
the
originals
as
your

i
think
its
a
waste
of
time
space
and
money
as
well
as
it
makes
it
to
tempting
to
lend
out
the

my
own
practice
with
new

make
a
copy
of
the
original
floppies
to
a
second

of
floppies
install

accidents
can
happen

sometimes
software
goes
out
on

that
are
just
marginally
good
or
gets
too
close

a

ive
had
experience
with
something
like
the
last
i
purchased
a
compiler
from
a
reputable
vendor
the
debugger
in
the
package
just
would
not
install
to
the

no
way
repeated
floppytofloppy
copies
finally
got
a
clean
read
of
the

i
dont
recall
if
i
used
diskcopy
copyb
or
xcopy
i
made
a
second
copy
of
the
marginal
floppy
and
installed
from
that
no
problenms
except
with
my

since
i
regard
backup

as

still

anything

before

wouldnt

you

method
the
initial
requirement
was
to
design
a
system
to
locate
a
dancer
in
one
of
eight
zones
across
the
stage
i
did
some
experiments
with
pyroelectric
detectors
and
found
them
difficult
to
align
to
get
a
definite
zone
transition
and
dancers
stand
still
alot
so
their
ir
signature
goes
away
the
good
thing
about
pryoelectrics
is
that
their
signal
is
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
warm
body
or
body
part
and
the
velocity
of
said
body
this
could
be
useful
for
detecting
the
intensity
of
a
dance
gesture
dancers
also
really
hate
to
wear
little
boxes
and
batteries
strapped
on
their
bodies

they
really
need

re
switching
ps
questions
anyways
ive
built
the
basic
up
down
converters
with
pretty
good
results
efficiency
but
im
running
into
problems
when
i
try
to
design
build
anything
that
puts
out
serious
amps
i
know
it
can
be
done
i
have
some
guts
on
my
bench
but
something
puzzles
me
im
using
a
simple
choke
as
the
storage
element
basicly
a
toroid
with
a
single
winding
but
all
commercial
models
use
transformers
with
many
windings
i
traced
a
few
and
they
seem
to
use
some
of
the
winding
for
the
usual
errorfeedback
but
some
of
the
others
seem
to
loose
me
what
are
they
for
better
than
that
anyone
have
a
full
schematic
for
one
of
these
that
i
could
get
a
copy
of
id
love
to
see
how
they
manage
to
squeeze
out
so
much
from
such
low
volume
most
commercial
switchers
do
not
use
magnetics
for
their
energy
storage
thats
handled
by
the
big
caps
on
the
primary
side
those
which
in
a
linearlyregulated
power
supply
would
be
considered
the
filter
caps
coming
right
after
the
bridge
the
transformer
is
just
that
a
transformer
its
there
primarily
to
step
the
voltage
up
or
down
although
the
inductance
seen
by
the
switch
transistor
on
the
primary
side
is
not
negligible
as
anyone
whos
zapped
said
transistor
from
either
failing
to
get
one
with
a
high
enough
breakdown
voltage
or
neglecting
to
include
a
snubber
diode
across
it
would
tell
you
actually
many
transistors
intended
for
switcher
use
today
have
the
diode
built
in
the
basic
switchedmode
power
supply
operates
something
like
this
in
a
somewhat
simplified
manner
the
ac
line
is
rectified
to
produce
a
high
voltage
moreorless
unregulated
dc
rail
the
energy
storage
or
filter
caps
appear
across
this
rail
as
does
the
switching
transistor
the
transistor
chops
the
current
into
the
primary
side
of
the
transformer
resulting
in
steppedup
or
steppeddown
pulses
out
the
secondary
which
are
then
rectified
and
filtered
at
least
one
of
the
transformers
outputs
is
sampled
and
fed
back
to
the
control
circuit
for
the
switching
transistor
which
acts
in
a
pulsewidth
modulation
pwm
fashion
to
control
by
varying
the
pulse
width
the
amount
of
energy
being
dumped
into
the
primary
and
therefore
the
voltage
coming
out
at
the
secondary
the
remaining
outputs
may
be
allowed
to
simply
run
at
whatever
value
they
will
moreorless
tracking
the
regulated
output
or
they
may
have
some
additional
linear
regulation
added
you
may
also
note
that
the
feedback
between
the
regulated
output
and
the
pwm
control
which
is
most
typically
an
ic
is
not
done
via
a
direct
electrical
connection
this
is
due
to
various
safety
standards
which
require
primary
and
secondary
circuits
to
be
electrically
isolated
often
the
feedback
path
involves
an
optoisolator
to
meet
this
requirement
while
the
transformer
isnt
the
primary
energystorage
device
in
these
designs
this
does
not
mean
that
the
energy
stored
in
the
transformer
can
be
ignored
besides
the
inductive
kick
giving
the
switch
transistor
a
bad
time
as
noted
above
you
also
need
to
worry
about
getting
all
the
energy
that
went
in
to
the
transformer
back
out
again
one
way
or
another
in
some
designs
this
happens
more
or
less
automatically
but
in
others
you
need
to
take
special
care
to
ensure
that
the
transformer
core
doesnt
saturate
which
again
would
have
disastrous
results
best
left
to
the
imagination
im
not

any
stretch
of
the

the
motorcycle
from
the

this

to
preserve

i
just
went

and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two

are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never

that
cause
it
ruins

but
he
couldnt

why
its

fyi
the

of
an

is
inch
the
electronics
and
dynamics
of
the
ink
cartridge
however
limit
you
to
generating
dots
at
per
inch
on
almost
any
paper
the
ink
wicks
more
than
inch
anyway
the
method
of
depositing
and
fusing
toner
of
a
laster
printer
results
in
much
less
spread
than
ink
drop
technology
in
practice
there
is
little
difference
in
quality
but
more
care
is
needed
with
inkjet
because
smudges
etc
can
happen
it
doesnt
take
much
investigation
to
see
that
the
mechanical
and
electronic
complement
of
a
laser
printer
is
more
complex
than
inexpensive
ink
jet
printers
recall
also
that
laser
printers
offer
a
much
higher
throughput
ppm
for
a
laser
versus
about
ppm
for
an
ink
jet
printer
a
cheap
laser
printer
does
not
manage
that
sort
of
throughput
and
on
top
of
that
how
long
does
the
first
sheet
take
to
print
inkjets
are
faster
than
you
say
and
in
both
cases
the
computer
often
has
trouble
keeping
up
with
the
printer
i
have
a

a
lot
of

keep
up

a
sage
said
to
me
do
you
want
one
copy
or
lots
of
copies
one
inkjet
something
else
to
think
about
is
the
cost
of
consumables
over
the
life
of
the
printer
a
page
yield
toner
cartridge
is
about
us
at
discount
while
hp
high
capacity
page
yield
cartridges
are
about
us
at
discount
it
could
be
that
over
the
life
cycle
of
the
printer
that
consumables
for
laser
printers
are
less
than
ink
jet
printers
it
is
getting
progressively
closer
between
the
two
technologies
laser
printers
are
usually
desinged
for
higher
duty
cycles
in
pages
per
month
and
longer
product
replacement
cycles
paper
cost
is
the
same
and
both
can
use
refills
long
term
the
laserprinter
will
need
some
expensive
replacement
parts
consumables
and
on
top
of
that
are
the
amortisation
costs
which
favour
the
lowest
purchase
cost
printer
hp
inkjets
understand
pcl
so
in
many
cases
a
laserjet
driver
will
work
if
the
software
package
has
no
inkjet
driver
there
is
one
wild
difference
between
the
two
printers
a
laserprinter
is
a
page
printer
whilst
an
inkjet
is
a
line
printer
this
means
that
a
laserprinter
can
rotate

how
could
i
do
this
i
dont
want
it
just
to
turn
on
i
want
it
to
strobe
once
so
to
speak
per
every
beep
i
put
on
a
cassette
tape
would
it
be
better
to
use
a
circuit
based
on
the
volume
of
the
beeps
on
the
cassette
or
better
for
the
leds
to
respond
to
a
tone
of
a
certain
frequency
is
there
any
easy
way
to
do
either
of
these
im
looking
for
the
simplest
circuit
possible
i
guess
what
im
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
color
organ
but
not
quite
let
me
trt
to
explain
again
im
going
to
have
a
pattern
of
beats
or
beeps
on
a
cassette
tape
so
on
the
tape
youd
hear
beep
pause
beep
pause
beep
pauseetc
with
speed
increasing
as
time
goes
on
i
want
to
synchronize
an
led
probably
two
of
them
with
the
beeps
on
the
cassette
tape
so
the
led
with
each
beep
would
go
on
and
off
real
quick
generating
a
strobe
light
sort
of
effect
the
rapidity
of
the
beeps
on
the
tape
would
in
turn
effect
the
rapidity
of
the
blinking
of
the
leds
and
if
there
was
no
sound
on
the
tape
except
for
background
his
the
leds
would
remain
off

help

overall
here
first
of

anyone

can

dont
go
far
if

who
is
not
comletely
dos
ignorant
off

professional
crackers
arent
interested
in
copying
disks
they
are
programmers
who
get
some
thrill
out
of
going
through
unassembly
listings
of
programs
to
disable
copy
protection
such
as
serial
number
dialog
boxes
volume
label
checks
and
who
knows
what
when
it
comes
to
computer
games
those
people
are
in
the
minority
however
in
my
experience
with
the
world
of
people
and
software
it
seems
that
a
good
majority
of
people
say
will
at
some
point
copy
a
friends
program
gee
you
really
oughta
try
this
or
accept
a
copy
these
are
people
who
normally
would
buy
a
software
package
or
do
without
but
decided
that
just
once
it
wouldnt
matter
the
last
thing
is
people
who
own

arent

are
the
boards
at
all
intelligent
ie
run
by
microcontrollers
the
easiest
thing
would
be
to
have
another
line
that
says
that
one
of
the
boards
is
talking
to
the
pc
when
this
line
was
true
the
other
boards
could
all
hold
off
and
not
send
their
data
this
isnt
a
perfect
solution
though
since
you
have
to
worry
a
little
about
making
sure
two
boards
dont
decide
to
talk
at
the
exact
same
time
other
than
that
i
think
you
will
need
to
hook
up
each
board
to
something
that
speaks
this
actually
isnt
as
hard
or
as
expensive
as
it
used
to
be
though
assuming
the
boards
talk
relatively
slowly
bps
or
slower
the
pics
can
coordinate
things
between
themselves
to
multiplex
the
data
this
is
really
just
forbicly
adding
the
suggestion
in
the
first
paragraph
to
your
system
and
it
assumes
that
each
board
doesnt
talk
more
than
of
the
time
of
for
very
long
since
a
pic
isnt
going
to
be
able
to
buffer
more
than
maybe
bytes

might
want

part
i
thought
the
first
thread
was
hilarious
so
here
goes
another
post
some
more
background
information
on
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
batteries
one
year
i
left
the
batteries
in
the
garage
the
garage
is
unheated
they
were
left
in
their
places
that
they
needed
to
be
one
in
the
riding
lawnmower
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycle
the
battery
in
the
riding
lawnmower
was
about
years
old
and
one
of
the
cycle
batteries
was
new
and
one
was
around
years
old
upon
spring
time
i
discovered
that
all
of
the
batteries
were
dead
and
needed
to
be
recharged
they
all
worked
properly
except
for
the
older
ones
and
they
had
to
be
replaced
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
originally
been
stored
in
the
garage
and
i
think
i
remember
my
dad
charging
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decided
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
has
two
parts
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concrete
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discovered
in
the
spring
about
days
ago
that
not
only
were
the
batteries
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmeter
read
around
in
other
words
it
was
pinned
the
internal
circut
tripped
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteries
they
were
the
same
realizing
that
we
still
had
gigantic
sailboat
batteries
also
lead
acid
i
decided
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sitting
for
around
and
a
half
years
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
noticed
that
they
only
needed
a
small
charge
around
hours
or
so
on
trickle
i
tested
them
by
using
them
at
the
local
gas
station
for
giving
jump
starts
and
they
worked
fine
for
around
of
em
this
leads
me
to
believe
one
of
several
things
i
bought
really
tty
batteries
last
year
sorta
true
the
concrete
has
something
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
the
batteries
there
was
enough
moisture
to
short
out
the
terminals
in
the
room
where
the
concrete
is
the
dirt
room
was
able
to
absorb
the
moisture
in
the
air
better
than
concrete
btw
i
can
almost
waterski

the

uh

why

when
you
place

because
the
temperature
of
your
hand
unlike
that
of

is
determined
by
the
balance
between
internal

production

youre
feeling
the
greater

which
is
kept
much
warmer

its

in
the
case
of
an

with

this
will
affect
how
quickly
it
comes
into
equilibrium
with
its

if
it
started
out
not
in
equilibrium
with
them

wont
affect
the

remove
all

we
did

washer

we
would
use

several

on
more

one

after

it
would
not

would

under

would
put
a

around
it
to
try

minimize
this
around
the

wires
etc
and
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
try
and
wipe
all
these
areas
down
with
a
dry
rag
the
usual
solution
was
to
carry
a
can
of
and
when
the

wouldnt
start
to
spray
all
the
likely
areas

it
would
then
start

the

check

they
must
file
with

maintain

a

your

the

it

unfortunately
the

that
a

that

perfectly
legally
could
possibly
cause

to
a

just
because
the
manufacturer
of
the

cut
corners
on

of

that
wouldnt
affect
one

in
a

but
which
bites
you
often
that
can
be
remedied
for
just
a
few
pennies
by
a

person
perhaps
even
the

operating

or
so
my

disadvantages
ink
used

i

it
is

about

i
think
theyre
now
down
to
the

carts
used
to
say
theyre
dated
for
only
months
but
i
dont
think
they
say
so
anymore
we
stick
to
a

supply

we
use

doesnt
happen
unless
you

and
you
grab
the
paper
and
smudge
it
all
over
as
soon
as
it
comes

other

this
can
be
an
advantage
in

usually
ways
around

i
bet
hp
probably
has
a

they
wont

the

unless
you
go
for
cheap

no

even
when

if
you
want
slow

flash

adjustable
by

or
by
a
digitally
controlled
switch
i
suggest
looking
at
a
oscillator
chip
they
cost
at
radio
shack
much
cheaper
in
quantity
at
quality
places
and
you
will
be
able
to
find
good
info
about
simple
circuits
in
a
oscialltor
notebook
i
think
forest
mims
has
one
at
radio
shack
youll
have
to
toy
with
resistorcapacitor
values
or
you
can
use
your
head
with
a
little
math
to
get
the
right
frequencies
any
engineer
worth
his
salt
can
make

left

to
you
to
see
i
hate
doing

circuit
graphics
the

accurately
go
from
a
few
hz
to

khz
i
think
about
the
tape
recorder
gizmo
you
could
alter
a
stereo
tape
deck
to
use
one
channel
as
a
data
line
for
flashing
led
and
one
as
audio
line
for
voice
or
music
this
would
eliminate
a
lot
of
noise
the
data
line
is
probably
most
easily
done
by
some
kind
of
pll
or
bandpass
filter
using
just
an
opamp
the
chip
is
a
good
pll
and
not
hard
to
work
with
however
if
you
nothing
about
how
a
pll
works
i
suggest
you
dont
try
this
opamp
information
can
also
be
found
in
the
forest
mims
radio
shack
infobooklets
and
the
popular
opamp
is
a
snap
to
work
with
setting

and
bandpass

values
are
not
so
easy
so
i
would

the
method
firstmost
i
have
no

what
this
is
going
into
so
i
am
really
generalizing
as

if

only
goofing

i
suggest
you
breadboard
the

no

i
thought
the
first
thread
was
hilarious
so
here
goes
another
post
some
more
background
information
on
what
has
happened
to
my
poor
batteries
one
year
i
left
the
batteries
in
the
garage
the
garage
is
unheated
they
were
left
in
their
places
that
they
needed
to
be
one
in
the
riding
lawnmower
what
a
lux
and
one
in
each
motorcycle
the
battery
in
the
riding
lawnmower
was
about
years
old
and
one
of
the
cycle
batteries
was
new
and
one
was
around
years
old
upon
spring
time
i
discovered
that
all
of
the
batteries
were
dead
and
needed
to
be
recharged
they
all
worked
properly
except
for
the
older
ones
and
they
had
to
be
replaced
about
halfway
through
the
summer
they
had
originally
been
stored
in
the
garage
and
i
think
i
remember
my
dad
charging
them
in
spring
last
year
i
decided
to
bring
them
in
to
the
basement
which
has
two
parts
one
is
dirt
and
brick
and
the
other
is
concrete
i
brought
in
all
three
and
discovered
in
the
spring
about
days
ago
that
not
only
were
the
batteries
dead
but
when
i
put
the
charger
on
them
the
charger
said
hmmmmmmmm
and
the
ampmeter
read
around
in
other
words
it
was
pinned
the
internal
circut
tripped
and
i
went
on
to
the
other
batteries
they
were
the
same
realizing
that
we
still
had
gigantic
sailboat
batteries
also
lead
acid
i
decided
to
put
the
charger
on
them
these
had
been
sitting
for
around
and
a
half
years
on
the
brick
and
dirt
part
and
noticed
that
they
only
needed
a
small
charge
around
hours
or
so
on
trickle
i
tested
them
by
using
them
at
the
local
gas
station
for
giving
jump
starts
and
they
worked
fine
for
around
of
em
this
leads
me
to
believe
one
of
several
things
i
bought
really
tty
batteries
last
year
sorta
true
the
concrete
has
something
to
do
with
the
discharge
of
the
batteries
there
was
enough
moisture
to
short
out
the
terminals
in
the
room
where
the
concrete
is
the
dirt
room
was
able
to
absorb
the
moisture
in
the
air
better
than
concrete
btw
i
can
almost
waterski
in
the
dirt
room
any
other
ideas
could
be
the
aliens
anything
is
possible
the
leadacid
secondary
cell
releases
energy
electricity
with
the
following
chemical
reaction
pb
lead
and
lead
iv
oxide
and
sulfuric
acid
produce
lead
sulfate
and
water
the
standard
heats
of
formation
at
c
f
of
the
various
compounds
are
heat
of
formation
compound
at
c
kcalmole
pb
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefore
kcal
per
mole
produced
note
that
lead
sulfate
is
not
very
soluble
grams
per
grams
water
at
c
and
it
will
thus
precipitate
out
of
solution
where
the
reaction
is
occurring
or
the
cathode
positive
terminal
of
the
battery
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
positive
terminal
where
the
precipitate
forms
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corroded
battery
to
corrobate
and
i
dont
feel
like
thinking
through
it
right
now
what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
that
the
reaction
as
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exothermic
or
energy
discharging
if
moisture
with
dissolved
electrolytes
acid
rain
condenses
on
the
battery
a
conductive
path
between
the
terminals
may
form
this
will
discharge
the
battery
as
the
chemical
reaction
proceeds
the
reaction
is
reversible
if
electricity
from
an
alternator
or
battery
charger
is
put
back
into
the
battery
leadacid
batteries
must
change
in
chemical
composition
to
discharge
each
cell
has
all
the
reactants
necessary
for
the
reaction
the
nonreacting
posts
terminals
of
the
leadacid
battery
are
there
to
remove
or
add
electric
energy
during
a
discharge
or
charge
because
the
reaction
is
exothermic
it
has
a
tendency
to
happen
though
quite
slowly
under
normal
circumstances
so
while
keeping
the
battery
dry
is
a
good
idea
it
is
not
a
total
solution
to
understand
why
leadacid
batteries
do
indeed
discharge
faster
when
stored
on
concrete
as
opposed
to
wood
or
earth
dirt
one
should
recall
lechateliers
principle
which
can
be
paraphrased
as
anything
subjected
to
some
stress
will
act
to
move
to
a
more
comfortable

also
c

and
the
values
for

are
on
the
same
order
of
magnitude
as
natural
earth
the
thermal
conductivity
of
concrete
is
around
a
factor
of
greater
than
that
of
dirt
and
is
times
greater
than
wood
it
is
these
differences
in
thermal
conductivity
that
cause
the
battery
on
concrete
to
discharge
faster
than
that
on
dirt
or
wood
at
any
instant
the
discharge
reaction
is
occurring
energy
is
being
released
either
as

or
heat
thermal
conductivity
of
air
is
about
btuhrftftfft
during
storage
except
for
the
trickle
that
passes
through
any
condensate
on
the
battery
this
energy
is
mostly
released
as
heat
the
higher
conductivity
surface
will
remove
the
heat
proportionately
faster
than
the
lower
conductivity
surface
thus
if
you
perfectly

a
dry

on

the

temperature
the

will
be
discharging
about
times
faster
than
that
on
dirt
this
is
where
lechateliers
principle
comes
into
play
removing
energy
from
the
exothermic
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
completion
if
the
reaction
normally
occurs
at
room
temperature
keeping
the
battery
at
that
temperature
requires
the
removal
of
any
heat
produced
a
concrete
surface
is
a
better
heat
sink
than
a
dirt
or
wood
surface
store
a
battery
in
the
corner
of
a
poured
concrete
basement
and
you
have
surfaces
removing
energy
which
pulls
the
reaction
along
also
if
water
evaporates
from
the
battery
that
elevates
the
ratio
of
sulfuric
acid
to
water
this
will
tend
to
drive

then

the

is

at

the

anyway
tagging
the

still
going

this

doesnt

otherwise
i

it
would

the

would

your

it
is
easier
are
you

then
the

not

gets

my

the
worst
thing
i
want
that
software
telling
me
is
this
software
has
already
been
registered
to
blank
and
it
is
against
the
law
to
install
it
on
other
machines
or
something
similar
access
for
windows
does
this
and
it
only
requires
a
click
on
ok
to
go
away
pretty
nonintrusive
but
it
gets
the
point
across
what
i
said
was
the
program
should
have
certain
restriction
such
as
the
restricttoonemachine
until
the
program
is
registered
with
the
manufacturer
the
manufacturer
will
then
supply
the

with
a

disable

this

a

i
like
the
key

that
some

use
the
only
problem
is
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
big
software
companies
to
implement
this
without
it
getting
very
costineffective
for

and
more
of

right

i
was
wondering
what
the
best
way
to
scale
an
ac
voltage
using
an
digital
word
is
i
am
thinking
of
using
the
common
method
of
sending
the
word
through
an
adc
and
then
comparing
it
with
the
ac
voltage
converted
to
a
sawtooth
wave
to
get
a
duty
cycle
however
i
am
leary
of
this
method
because
it
a
requires
a
lot
of
parts
and
more
importantly
b
creates
a
lot
of
interference
from
the
switching
on
the
entire
ac
line
i
realize
that
correct
filtering
could
cancel
out
most
of
this
interference
but
that
would
require
more
parts
and
boost
the
price
further
someone
mentioned
to
me
that
they
had
seen
an
ic
which
input
bits
of
data
and
directly
scaled
the
ac
voltage
coming
in
all

unfortunately
he
couldnt
remember
the
chip
number
or
the
manufacturer
if
anyone
else
has
heard
of
this
chip
please
email
me
i
am
building
this
project
as
a
dimmer
box
for
a
light
controller
circuit
and
it
is
important
that
the
cost
of
each
box
remains
very
low
because
one
dimmer
is
required
for
each
light
that
the
user
wishes
to
control
well
each
channel
at
least
therefor
if
each
box
costs
i
doubt
that
an
end
user
will
want
to
dish
out
x
for
sixteen
channels
this
is
something
i
have
noticed
about
todays
dimmer
boxes
they
are
so
expensive
anyway
any
help
which
someone
could
offer

either
a
method
of
easily
doing
this
or

andy
for

silversolder

tasks
due
to
the
mechanism
of
dendritic
growth
silversolder
when
exposed

high

and
placed
in
an
electric
field
will
actually
grow
dendrites
which
are
conductive
and
will
adventually
electrically
short
across
closely

which
are
creating
the
field
for
this

silver

allowed
only
in
hermetically

fortunatly
tinlead
solder
is
quite
stable
and
will
not
grow
dendrites
as

silversolder
therefore
it
is

i
did
this
on

did
indeed
find
that

last
longer
i
dont

i
suggest
contacting
your

that
vary
depending
on
the
starting

printer
and
the
level
to
which
you
wish
to
upgrade
i
upgraded
my
original
desket
to
a
dekjet
the
kit
was
fairly
expensive
you
are
likely
better
off
selling
your
old
printer
and
purchasing
a
new
deskjet
now
that
prices
have
declined
so
much
upgrading

a
fair
amount
of
skill

no

contact
your

the
pcl
language
used
by
deskjets
is
considerably
different
from
the
pcl
used
by
laser
printers
especially
the
newer
laser
printers
the
biggest
problem
is
dumb
laser
drivers
that
send
a
raster
end
command
after
each
scan
line
this
makes
no
material
difference
for
lasers
but
causes
the
deskjet
to
print
the
accumulated
raster
as
you
might
guess
the
result
is
hideously
slow
printing
the
new
dos
wordperfect
print
deskjet
drivers
are
still
guilty
of
this
particular
behavior
from
the
way
wordperfect
works
this
would
not
be
easy
to
change
windows
wordperfect
works
efficiently
unless
you
use
the
dos

the
dialect
used

iiip
allows
compression
that
permits
a
full
page
dpi
image
to
be
rendered
with
only
one
megabyte
of
memory
an
uncompressed
image
could
be
as
large
as
about
kbytes
but
the
printer
needs
about
of
memory
for
its
internal
housekeeping
laserjet
iv
models
support
banded
printing
that
allows
incrmental
download
of
the
image
with
compression
in
limited
memory
situations
deskjet
downloadable
fonts
are
not
compatible
with
laserjet
fonts
a
single
page
from
a
laserjet
only
requires
about
seconds
this
is
faster
than
any
but
the
most
trivial
printing
from
a
deskjet
printer
the
presumption
of
course
being
that
the
laser
printer
has
completed
its
warmup
cyle
until
ink
chemistry
is
changed
wicking
resulting
in
image
deterioration
is
unavoidable
i
wont
use
the
word
impossible
but
matching
laser
quality
output
from
a
deskjet
printer
is
unlikely
chosing
an
appropriate
paper
type
helps
but
does
not
eliminate
the
problem
laser
printers
are
more
wastful
of
energy
and
consumable
components
hp
does
accept
return
of
spent
toner
cartridges
mitigating
the
material
waste
problem
to
a
degree
energy

reduced

kyocera

the
image
drum
is
good
for
approximately
copies
it
is
a
very
nice
print
engine
i
wish
hp
used
the
kyocera
engine
kyocera

has
a
neat

source
and

the
recommended
duty

laser
printers
the
pickup
pressure
rollers
are
subject
to
wear
and
i
case
confirm
eventually
do
wear
out
the
usual
symptom
is
that
the
printer
becomes
reluctant
to
feed
paper
the
paper
feed
is
integrated
in
a
transport
mechanism
that
is
a
single
part
from
hp
service
replacement
cost
for
the
transport
is
almost
the
feed
rollers
are
not
separately
replacable
though
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
job
for
a
competent
technician
i
have
disassembled
and
reassembled
the
transport
on
my
own
printer
it
depends
upon
the
application
which
printer
is
best
for
you
if
you
only
print
or
pages
a
day
and
are
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of

the
deskjet
is
a
very
good
choice
as
noted
the

my
choice

not

i

i

a

no

logo
etc
is
there
a
technical
reason
or
could
it
be
that
the
marketing
geniuses
have
not
tought
about
it
yet
the
green
layer
is
a
soldermask
and
is
used
to
make
a
finished
board
look
neat
and
to
avoid
solder
bridges
especially
when
using
wave
soldering
or
any
other
mechanized
approach
ive
seen
red
mask
but
most
that
ive
seen
are
green
a
bakelite
board
will
look
brown
in
colour
and
if
the
solder
mask
is
put
on
looks
like
a
brown
board
with
green
paint
on
either
side
or
just
one
side
of
the
board
a
fibreglass
board
will
look
green
from
the
side
because
the
green
soldermask
makes
the
board
appear
that
colour
if
you
got
a
fibreglass
board
with
no
mask
it
would
be
a
whitishgrey
colour
teflon
boards
do
exist
as
well
but
im
not
sure
about
that
one
id
guess
the
stuff
they
invented
for
solder
mask
was
green
so
theyre
not
about
to
change
also
any
change
in
any
chemical
probably
requires
a
better
than
normal

a

but
they
need

expand

more

these

arent

we
paid

get
monthly

of
some
of

we
send
the

back

so
that
they
will
keep
sending

the

i
think
we
pay
a

fee
of

to
get

if
you

you
can

you

printing
takes

it

re
lead
acid
batteries
part
the
leadacid
secondary
cell
releases
energy
electricity
with
the
following
chemical
reaction
pb
lead
and
lead
iv
oxide
and
sulfuric
acid
produce
lead
sulfate
and
water
heats
of
formation
deleted
the
heat
of
reaction
at
c
is
therefore
kcal
per
mole
produced
note
that
lead
sulfate
is
not
very
soluble
grams
per
grams
water
at
c
and
it
will
thus
precipitate
out
of
solution
where
the
reaction
is
occurring
or
the
cathode
positive
terminal
of
the
battery
i
am
almost
sure
it
is
the
positive
terminal
where
the
precipitate
forms
but
i
may
be
wrong
oh
well
i
dont
have
a
corroded
battery
to
corrobate
and
i
dont
feel
like
thinking
through
it
right
now
the
major
problem
with
this
is
that
the
reaction
takes
place
in
an
acid
solution
is
soluble
in
an
acid
solution
and
will
not
precipitate
out
also
is
in
a
water
solution
as
and
thus
the
heats
of
formation
of
and
are
for
the
most
part
irrelevant
what
is
important
to
notice
here
is
that
the
reaction
as
you
knew
it
would
be
is
exothermic
or
energy
discharging
as
it
turns
out
the
reaction
is
indeed
exothermic
heat
producing
more
about
this
later
what
actually
happens
to
make
the
battery
completely
useless
is
this
were
talking
leadacid
batteries
of
course
the
battery
slowly
self
discharges
as
this
discharge
takes
place
two
things
happen
the
level
of
pb
ions
in
the
acid
solution
increases
ie
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
are
dissolved
the
level
of
ions
in
the
acid
solution
decreases
ie
the
solution
becomes
less
acidic
or
more
like
water
if
you
like
now
as
the
post
to
which
i
am
responding
correctly
stated
will
precipitate
in
a
water
nonacid
solution
when
the
battery
dies
ie
is
fully
discharged
we
end
up
with
a
high
concentration
of
pb
and
in
water
so
forms
in
the
solution
and
falls
to
the
bottom
of
the
battery
of
course
this
happens
in
varying
degrees
the
more
discharged
the
more
precipitate
forms
the
precipitate
forms
a
conductive
layer
on
the
bottom
of
the
battery
if
there
is
enough
of
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
left
to
touch
the
precipitate
more
common
in
a
newer
battery
a
dead
short
results
i
have
seen
products
in
automotive
shops
to
correct
this
condition
but
they
are
for
the
most
part
useless
they
can
dissolve
the
but
cannot
restore
the
lead
and
lead
oxide
plates
properly
you
may
have
some
success
with
these
products
for
a
newer
battery
stuff
deleted
to
understand
why
leadacid
batteries
do
indeed
discharge
faster
when
stored
on
concrete
as
opposed
to
wood
or
earth
dirt
one
should
recall
lechateliers
principle
which
can
be
paraphrased
as
anything
subjected
to
some
stress
will
act
to
move
to
a
more
comfortable
position
here
are
the
thermal
conductivities
of
a
some
selected
materials
stuff
deleted
this
is
where
lechateliers
principle
comes
into
play
removing
energy
from
the
exothermic
reaction
will
drive
the
reaction
further
to
completion
if
the
reaction
normally
occurs
at
room
temperature
keeping
the
battery
at
that
temperature
requires
the
removal
of
any
heat
produced
a
concrete
surface
is
a
better
heat
sink
than
a
dirt
or
wood
surface
store
a
battery
in
the
corner
of
a
poured
concrete
basement
and
you
have
surfaces
removing
energy
which
pulls
the
reaction
along
this
stuff
is
just
made
up
by
the
author
and
is
completely
invalid
in
fact
the
discharge
reaction
takes
place
at
a
higher
rate
at
higher
temperatures
a
logical
consequence
of
the
above
argument
is
this
if
you
really
want
your
car
to
start
lower
the
battery
temperature
to
to
pull
the
reaction
along
we
all
know
from
experience
at
least
those
of
us
in
canada
do
it
gets
cold
up
here
that
this
is
not
true
if
we
want
to
start
our
car
on
a
really
cold
day
we
warm
the
battery
besides
which
there
is
not
enough
energy
released
through
self
discharge
to
appreciably
raise
the
temperature
the
air
would
amply
dissipate
any
such
heat
whether
the
bottom
of
the
battery
was
insulated
or
not
this
is
of
course
irrelevant
since
you
would
want
the
battery
to
be
cool
during
storage
just
keep
the
battery
in
a
cool
dry
place
and
keep
it
charged

what

on

either
acetone
or
a

the
latter
of
the
two
is
a

dangerous
possibly
a

but
it
usualy
gets
the
job
done
i
imagine
you
can
you
the
two
solvents
on
most
metals
as
well
as
glass
but
keep
the
stuff
away
from

better
yet
you
may

these

if

the

would
disolve

the

this

does
anyone

what

i
should

yet
another

but
this
one
is
nontoxic
although
i
would
handle
it
like
any
other
cleaner
and
it
smells
nice
the
chemical
is
called
dlimonene
and
it
smells
like
lemon
peels
i
think
it
is
a
lemon
extract
of
some
kind
you
might
find
it
in
a
hardware
store
sold
as
a
generalpurpose
solvent
but
your
best
bet
would
be
any
bike
store
it
is
used
as
a
chaincleaning
fluid
it
works
on
sticker
glue
crayons
grease
oil
etc
its
clear
yellow
in
the
bottle
and
you
can
use
it
straight
if
you
add
water
it
changes
to
a
creamy
consistency
which
is
good
for

just
a

question
what

clean
electronic

safely
ie
not
corrode
dissolve
shortout
etc
the
equipment
water
methanol
you
dont
say
what
kind
of
electronic

you
mean
its
hard
to
give
a
generic
answer
there
is
essentially
no
solvent
that
wont
do
things
like
washing
lubricant
out
of
switches
when
weve
needed
to
do
an
emergency
cleaning
job
on
things
weve
just
used
distilled
water
the
key
thing
to
remember
is
to
make
sure
the
gear
is
completely
dry
before
powering
it
up
again
we
let
it
dry
for
several
days
to
be
damn
sure
i
doubt
that
methanol
has
significant
advantages
over
water
i
would
be
very
wary
of
not
least
because
it
is
dangerous
to
you
even
if
its
not
going
to
harm
the
equipment
not
only
is
it
poisonous
but
i
believe
its
now
known
to
be
carcinogenic

i
am
not
quite

sure
about
the

of
using

i
vaguely
remember
a

when
deutsche

and

there
was
some
discussion
about
a

i
know
that
cordless

cellular

still
have
to

by
the

does
that

true

in

you

yes
it
does
all
the

has
to
have
that

number
to
be

what
has
changed
is
that
you
can
buy
the

somewhere
else
im
pretty
sure
the

true
in

at

could
there
be

there
been

well
the
fastest
crudest
mixer
aside
from
just
physically
connecting
all
your
inputs
together
directly
is
to
run
each
signal
through
a
resistor
to
a
common
output
the
resistors
give
some
isolation
so
the
signal
sources
arent
driving
directly
into
each
other
taking
a

id
say
that
if
you

highimpedance

your

ought
to
be

my

that

larger

this

all
be

with
a

of

nope
your

either
being
caused
by
excessive
voltage
drop
in
the
long
cable
from
the

or
just
plain
not
having
enough
power
i
would
suspect
that
those
amps
are
going
to
draw
a
lot
of
current
on
short
peaks
you
can
try
using
larger
and
shorter
cables
to
the
generator
or
try
strapping
the
amps
for
service
and
running
mains
cables
out
which
will
minimize
the
line
drop
if
these
dont
work
though
youre
going

need
a
bigger

i
assume

youre
using

have
watched

in

be

also
it

that

be
given
to
a

publish

sadly
that

nowadays
a

usenet
is
great
for

the
discussion
under
the
old
topic
went
in
the
wrong
direction
some
people
instead
of
discussing
the
issue
itself
they
decided
to
discuss
the
nontechnical
part
of
the
issue
so
here
i
go
with
my
limited
knowledge
about
this
issue
hoping
you
guys
cut
the
crap
and
talk
about
the
real
technical
ways
to
do
this
the
methods
that
i
am
aware
that
are
effective
are
laser
hole
burning
this
would
leave
the
disk
damaged
so
if
you
format
that
particular
sector
of
the
disk
you
can
not
write
to
it
it
is
very
laser
holes
are
or
were
used
to
prevent
someone
from
making
exact
copies
of
a
disk
you
do
not
want
to
write
to
the
damaged
disk
only
read
and
use
the
programs
hard
for
crackers
to
damage
the
disk
exactly
the
same
way
i
remember
a
program
called
copywrite
that
could
copy
a
disk
with
a
laser
hole
in
it
i
think
it
simulates
the
laser
hole
after
copying
the
disk
the
program
is
if
necessary
used
in
conjunction
with
a
program
called
nokey
or
something
the
program
tells
you
which
program
to
use
no

the
leadacid
secondary
cell
discharge
reaction
is
exothermic
i
am
glad
you
do
not
dispute
this
point
if
you
dont
want
the
lead
storage
battery
to
discharge
it
should
be
stored
such
that
its
charged
state
is
the
equilibrium
state
during
winter
the
ground
be
it
covered
with
concrete
dirt
or
wood
maintains
a
cooler
temperature
on
average
than
the
surrounding
air
or
the
battery
the
heat
capacity
of
air
is
less
than
that
of
concrete
dirt
or
wood
so
it
heats
faster
conversely
air
cools
faster
too
the
normal
storage
procedure
for
a
battery
is
to
leave
it
in
an
unheated
garage
or
basement
the
storage
surface
is
often
cooler
than
the
surrounding
air
with
the
battery
temperature
somewhere
inbetween
eg
the
basement
air
temperature
may
be
f
the
floor
temperature
f
and
the
battery
temperature
f
the
air
temperature
is
higher
than
the
battery
temperature
the
heat
of
reaction
is
not
going
to
move
up
the
gradient
the
floor
temperature
is
lower
than
the
battery
temperature
and
heat
is
going
to
move
to
it
the
floor
is
an
incredible
heat
sink
might
depend
on
where
you
live
i
know
locally
for
most
of
the
winter
the
ground
and
concrete
floor
within
sheds
and
garages
unheated
is
signifacantly
warmer
than
the
average
air
temperature
the
air
does
get
warmer
during
the
day
but
during
the
night
the
ground
and
concrete
is
definitely
warmer
especially
when
protected
by
the
walls
from
the
albedo
effect
and
the
nights
are
longer
by
several
hours

the
days

richard

sorry
about
following
up
my
own
article
but
i
wanted
to
continue
that
what
might
be
being
missed
here
is
that
the
important
thing
might
not
be
temperature
differences
per
se
but
the
action
of
heat
sinking
the
battery
perhap
someone
could
conduct
an
experiment
taking
two
identical
lead
acid
batteries
placing
both
on
wooden
shelves
but
putting
one
of
them
in
a
water
bath
designed
to
act
as
a
heat
sink
this
would
eliminate
the
concrete
floor
effect
and
keep
both
batteries
at
the
same
ambient
temperature
i
think
the
argument
over
temperatures
is
not
pertinent
but
the
one
over
heat
conductance
and
removing
the
exothermic
heat
may
have
some
validity
