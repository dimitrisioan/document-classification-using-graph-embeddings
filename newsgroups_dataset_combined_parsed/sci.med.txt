gauchers

i
have
a
yr
old
male
friend
misdiagnosed
as
having
osteopporosis
for
two
years
who
recently
found
out
that
his
illness
is
the
rare
gauchers
disease
gauchers
disease
symptoms
include
brittle
bones
he
lost
inches
off
his
hieght
enlarged
liver
and
spleen
internal
bleeding
and
fatigue
all
the
time
the
problem
in
type
is
attributed
to
a
genetic
mutation
where
there
is
a
lack
of
the
enzyme
glucocerebroside
in
macrophages
so
the
cells
swell
up
this
will
eventually
cause
death

another
uncommon
problem
is
maternal
hemorrhage
i
dont
remember
the
incidence
but
it
is
something
like
in

births
it
is
hard
to
see
how
you
could
handle
it
at

and
you
wouldnt
have
very
much

thing
you
might

is
that
peoples
risk

vary
i
consider
a
risk
of
loss
of
a
loved
one
to
require
considerable
effort
in
the
avoiding
mark
you
seem
to
be
terrified
of
the
birth
process
thats
ridiculous
and
unable
to
believe
that
womens
bodies
are
actually
designed
to
do
it
they
arent
designed
they
evolved
and
much
as
it
discomforts
us
in
humans
a
troublefree
birth
process
was
sacrificed
to
increased
brain
and
cranial
size
wild
animals
have
a
much
easier
time
with
birth
than
humans
do
domestic
horses
and
cows
typically
have
a
worse
time
to
give
you
an
idea
my
family
tree
is
complicated
because
a
few
of
my
pioneer
greatgreat
grandfathers
had
several
wives
and
we
never
could
figure
out
which
wife
had
each
child
one
might
ask
why
this
happened
my
greatgreat
grandfathers
were
by
the
time
they
reached
their
forties
quite
prosperous
farmers
nonetheless
they
lost
several
wives
each
to
the
rigors
of
childbirth
the
graveyards
in
spencer
indiana
and
boswell
north
dakota
contain
quite
a
few
gravestones
like
ida

of

baby
may
you
wanted
to
section
all
women
carrying
breech
in
case
one
in
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
breech
babies
get
hung
up
in
second
stage
more
like
one
in
ten
and
the
consequences
can
be
devastating
i
have
direct
experience
of
more
than
a
dozen
victims
of
a
fouledup
breech
birth
and
now
you
want
all
babies
born
in
hospital
based
on
a
guess
of
how
likely
maternal
hemorrhage
is
and
a
false
belief
that
it
is
fatal
it
isnt
always
fatal
but
it
is
often
fatal
when
it
happens
out
of
reach
of
adequate
help
more
often
it
permanently
damages
ones
health
clearly
womens
bodies
evolved
to
give
birth
i
am
no
believer
in
divine
design
however
evolution
did
not
favor
troublefree
births
for
humans
you
have
your
kids
where
you
want
you
encourage
your
wife
to
get
six
inch
holes
cut
through
her
stomach
muscles
expose
herself
to

and
whatever
other

exact
statistics
years
after
the
last
time
we
looked
them
up
rest
assured
that
we
balanced
csection
risks
against
other
risks
i
wouldnt
encourage
my
wife
to
have
a
caesarean
unless
it
was
clearly
indicated
on
the
other
hand
i
am
opposed
on
obvious
grounds
to
waiting
until
an
emergency
to
give
in
and
bear
this
in
mind
my
wife
took
the
lead
in
all
of
these
decisions
we
talked
things
over
and
i
did
a
lot
of
the
leg
work
but
the
main
decisions
were
really
hers
but
i
for
one
am
bothered
by
your
continued
suggestions
especially
to
the
misckidders
pregnant
for
the
first
time
that
birth
is
dangerous
even
fatal
and
that
all
these
unpleasant
things
are
far
better
than
the
risks
you
run
just
doing
it
naturally
i
dont
know
of
very
many
home
birth
advocates
even
that
think
that
a
firsttime
mother
should
have
her
baby
at

ive
had
a
section
im
planning
a
hospital
birth
this
time
but
for
heavens
sake
not
everyone
needs
that
but
people
should
bother
to
find
out
the
relative
risks
my
wife
was
unwilling
to
take
any
significant
risks
in
order
to
have
nice
surroundings
in
view
of
the
intensity
of
the
birth
experience
i
doubt
surroundings
have
much
importance
anyway
somehow
the
values
youre
advocating
seem
all
lopsided
to
me
taking
risks
even
if
fairly
small
of
serious
permanent
harm
in
order
to
preserve

i
experienced
breathing
difficulties
a

years

similar
to
those
described

it
turned
out
that
i
was
developing
type
i
diabetes
although
i
never
sought
direct
confirmation
of
this
from
my
doctor
i
think
that
the
breathing
problem
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
ketones
due
to
the
diabetes
i
think
that
ketosis
can
occur
in
lesser
degree
if
one
is
restricting
their
food
intake
drastically
i
dont
know
if
this

new

first

controversial
i
do

is
a
form
of
immotile
cilia

in
which
there
is
situs

chronic

situs
inversus
means
that
organs
are
on
the

side
of
the
body
and
can
be
complete
or
partial
it
is
interesting
medically
because
the

location
of

by
the
normal
rotation

ciliary
motion
so
that
in

this
laterality
can
be
random
people
with
situs

are
quite
popular
at
medical

of
their

the
fact
that
most
doctors
get
a

upset

is
an

can
anyone
out

enlighten

on
the
relationship
between
lung

of

fingertips
what
is
the
mechanism
and
why
would
a
physician
call
for
chest
xrays
to
diagnose
the
cause
of
the
clubbing
purists
often
distinguish
between
true
clubbing
and
pseudo
clubbing
the
difference
being
that
with
true
clubbing
the
angle
of
the
nail
when
viewed
from
the
side
is
constantly
negative
when
proceeding
distally
towards
the
fingertip
with
pseudo
clubbing
the
angle
is
initially
positive
then
negative
which
is
the
normal
situation
real
internists
can
talk
for
hours
about
clubbing
im
limited
to
a
couple
of
minutes
whether
this
distinction
has
anything
to
do
with
reality
is
entirely
unclear
but
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
internists
love
to
paw
over
during
rounds
supposedly
only
true
clubbing
is
associated
with
disease
the
problem
is
that
the
list
of
diseases
associated
with
clubbing
is
quite
long
and
includes
both
congenital
conditions
and
acquired
disease
since
many
of
these
diseases
are
associated
with
cardiopulmonary
problems
leading
to
right
to
left
shunts
and
chronic
hypoxemia
it
is
very
reasonable
to
get
a
chest
xray
however
many
of
the
congenital
abnormalities
would
only
be
diagnosed
with
a
cardiac
catheterization
the
cause
of
clubbing
is
unclear
but
presumably
relates
to
some
factor
causing
blood
vessels
in
the
distal
fingertip
to
dilate
abnormally
clubbing
is
one
of
those
things
from
an
examination
which
is
a
tipoff
to
do
more
extensive
examination
often
however
the
cause
of
the
clubbing
is
quite
apparent

there
are

organisms
viral

which
can

the

varies

the
causes
of
bacterial
meningitis
vary
with
age
in
adults
pneumococcus
the
same
organism
which
causes
pneumococcal
pneumonia
is
the
most
common
cause
while
in
children
hemophilus

is
the
most

what
you

is
meningitis
from
neisseria
meningitidis
which
is
the
second
most
common
cause
of
bacterial
meningitis
in
both
groups
but
with
lower
incidence
in
infants
this
organism
is
also
called
the
meningococcus
and
is
the
source
of
the
common
epidemics
of
meningitis
that
occur
and
are
popularized
in
the
press
without
prompt
treatment
and
even
with
it
in
some
cases
the
organism
typically
causes
death
within
a
day
this
organism
feared
as
it
is
is
actually
grown
from
the
throats
of
many
normal
adults
it
can
get
to
the
meninges
by
different
ways
but
blood
borne
spread
is
probably
the
usual
case
rifampin
an
oral

is
some
pelvic
pain
that
i
get
at
the
beginning
of
my
period
and
then
much
worse
at
midcycle
i
have
had
surgery
for
endometriosis
in
the
past
years
ago
so
the
drs
tell
me
that
my
pain
is
probably
due
to
the
endometriosis
coming
back
ive
tried
synarel
it
reduced
the
pain
while
i
took
it
mos
but
the
pain
returned
immediately
after
i
stopped
three
doctors
have
suggested
hysterectomy
as
the
only
real
solution
to
my
problem
although
i
dont
expect
to
have
any
more
children
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
having
my
uterus
and
one
remaining
ovary
removed
the
first
ovary
was
removed
when
i
had
the
surgery
for
endometriosis
one
of
the
drs
that
suggested
i
get
a
hysterectomy
is
an
expert
in
laser
surgery
but
perhaps
thinks
that
type
of
procedure
is
only
worthwhile
on
women
who
still
plan
to
have
children
so
basically
all
im
left
with
is
toughing
out
the
pain
this
would
be
impossible
without
naprosyn
or
something
similar
but
not
aspirin
that
doesnt
work
and
motrin
gave
me
horrible
gastritis
a
few
years
ago
so
im
through
with
it
in
fact
naprosyn
works
very
well
at
eliminating
the
pain
if
i
take
it
regularly
as
i
did
when
i
had
severe
back
pain
and
pain
in
both
legs
as
ill
discuss
in
a
moment
generally
though
i
wait
until
i
have
the
pain
before
i
take
the
naprosyn
but
then
it
takes
several
hours
for
it
reduce
the
pain
its
actually
quite
effective
at
reducing
the
pain
it
just
takes
quite
a
while
in
the
meantime
im
frequently
in
severe
pain
the
other
pain
source
i
have
is
chronic
lower
back
pain
resulting
in
bilateral
radiculopathy
ive
had
mris
xrays
ct
scan
and
emgs
ive
had
of
them
and
dont
intend
to
ever
do
that
again
with
nerve
conduction
tests
the
tests
have
not
been
conclusive
as
to
what
is
causing
my
back
and
leg
pain
the
mri
reports
both
say
i
have
several
bulging
degeneratig
disks
and
from
the
xrays
and
mri
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
i
have
arthritis
the
reading
on
the
ct
scan
was
that
there
are
two
herniations
and
but
others
hav
looked
at
the
films
and
concluded
that
there
are
no
herniations
the
second
emg
and
nerve
conduction
studies
shows
significant
denervation
compared
to
the
first
emg
oh
yeah
i
had
some
other
horrible
test
called
something
like
somatic
evoked
response
which
showed
that
the
internal
nerves
are
working
fine
anyway
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
sometimes
have
severe
pain
in
both
legs
and
back
pain
the
back
pain
is
there
all
the
time
but
i
can
live
with
it
when
the
leg
pain
is
there
i
need
some
analgesicantiinflammatory
medication
to
reduce
the
pain
to
a
level
where
i
can
work
so
i
took
naprosyn
regulary
for
months
every
time
i
tried
to
stop
the
leg
pain
got
worse
so
id
always
resume
since
last
november
i
have
taken
it
much
less
frequently
and
primarily
for
the
pelvic
pain
i
have
been
going
to
physical
therapy
for
the
last
months
times
a
week
after
the
first
month
or
so
my
therapist
put
me
on
pelvic
traction
she
had
tried
it
earlier
but
it
had
caused
a
lot
of
pain
in
my
back
this
time
she
tried
it
at
a
lower
weight
after
a
month
or
two
the
pain
in
my
legs
began
going
away
but
the
traction
aways
caused
discomfort
in
my
lower
back
which
could
be
reduced
with
ultrasound
and
massage
so
now
i
dont
have
nearly
as
much
pain
in
my
legs
in
fact
my
therapist
took
me
off
traction
about
weeks
ago
getting
back
to
my
original
reason
for
this
post
even
if
i
can
avoid
taking
analgesic
for
headaches
i
really
cant
avoid
them
entirely
because
i
have
other
pain
sources
that
force
me
to
use
them
oh
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
i
have
back
surgery
but
im
avoiding
that
too
i
find
the
migraines
difficult
to
deal
with
occassionally
i
have
to
take
off
work
but
usually
i
can
work
but
at
a
reduced
capacity
im
a
systems
engineer
and
do
a
lot
of
reading
and
writing
when
the
pelvic
pain
is
bad
i
cant
concentrate
much
i
usually
end
up
jumping
out
of
my
chair
every
few
minutes
because
the
pain
is
so
bothersome
when
the
pain
in
my
back
is
bad
it
can
cause
severe
burning
in
both
legs
shooting
pains
in
my
legs
electric
shock
type
of
pain
in
my
feet
and
toes
and
basically
when
it
gets
bad
i
cant
really
sit
at
all
then
i
end
up
spending
most
of
my
time
home
and
in
bed
so
even
if
the
analgesics
contribute
to
the
migraines
the
migraines
are
more
tolerable
than
the
other
pain
sources
i
get
a
lot
of
migraines
an
average
of
to
a
month
which
last
days
ive
taken
cafergot
the
first
time
the
caffiene
really
got
to
me
so
i
reduced
the
dosage
but
i
dont
like
the
side
effects
if
i
take
more
than
two
i
get
diahrea
if
i
get
a
very
bad
headache
i
will
eventually
take
the
cafergot
my
neurologist
wasnt
very
helpful
when
i
told
him
my
problems
with
cafergot
he
said
that
when
sumatriptan
becomes
available
i
should
try
that
ive
tried
several
other
medications
fiornal
midrin
fiornal
with
codeine
tegretol
and
inderal
but
they
either
didnt
work
or
i
couldnt
tolerate
them
so
what
can
i
do
my
doctors
seem
to
be
satisfied
with
me
just
trying
to
tolerate
the
pain
which
i
agree
with
most
of
the
time
but
not
when
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
ive
had
some
bad
experiences
with
surgery
my
heart
stopped
once
from
the
anesthesia
i
was
told
that
it
was
likely
the
succinylcholine
and
ive
already
had
surgery
several
times
anyway
the
point
of
what
im
saying
is
that
even
if
analgesics
can
contribute
to
migraines
some
people
need
to
take
them
to
tolerate
other
pain

my

spotty

i
bought
him
clearasil
face
wash

i
think
that
is
probably
enough
along
with
the
usual
good
diet
however
he
is
on
at

called
dalacin

which

only
treatment
but
is
not

over

i
have
asked
a

who
say
either
his

is
not
severe
enough
for
dalacin

or
that
clearasil
is
ok
i
had
the
odd
spots
as
a
teenager
nothing
serious
his
father
was
the
same
so
i
dont
figure
his
acne
is
going
to
escalate
into
something
disfiguring
but
i
know
kids
are
senstitive
about
their
appearance
i
am
wary
because
a
neighbours
son
had
this
wierd
malady
that
was
eventually
put
down
to
an
overdose

want
to

any

on
this

might

the
belief

usually

the
ol

re
jiggers
i
may
not
be
the
worlds
greatest
expert
on
chiggers
a
type
of
mite
indigenous
to
the
south
but
i
certainly
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
contemplating
the
little
buggers
over
the
past
six
years
since
we
moved
to
nc
here
are
some
observations
gained
from
painful
experience
reactions
to
chiggers
vary
greatly
from
person
to
person
some
people
get
tiny
red
bites
others
like
me
are
more
sensitive
and
get
fairly
large
swollen
sorelike
affairs
chigger
bites
are
the
gift
that
keeps
on
giving
i
swear
that
these
things
will
itch
for
months
there
is
a
lot
of
folklore
about
chiggers
i
think
most
of
it
is
fiction
i
have
tried
to
do
research
on
the
critters
since
they
have
such
an
effect
on
me
the
only
book
i
could
find
on
the
subject
was
a
single
book
in
uncs
special
collections
library
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
what
is
required
to
get
it
based
on
my
experience
and
that
of
my
family
members
the
old
folk
remedy
of
fingernail
polish
simply
doesnt
work
i
recall
reading
that
the
theory
upon
which
it
is
based
that
the
chiggers
burrow
into
your
skin
and
continue
to
party
there
is
false
i
think
it
is
more
likely
that
the
reaction
is
to
toxins
of
some
sort
the
little
pests
release
but
this
is
speculation
the
best
approach
is
prevention
a
couple
of
things
work
well
a
good
insect
repellent
deet
such
as
deep
woods
off
liberally
applied
to
ankles
waistband
etc
is
a
good
start
there
is
another
preparation
called
chig
away
that
is
a
combination
of
sulfur
and
some
kind
of
cream
cortisone
that
originally
was
prepared
for
the
army
and
is
not
commercially
available
in
the
summer
i
put
this
on
my
ankles
every
morning
when
i
get
up
on
weekends
since
i
literally
cant
go
outside
where
we
live
in
the
country
without
serious
consequences
they
apparently
dont
like
sulfur
much
at
all
you
can
use
sulfur
as
a
dust
on
your
body
or
clothing
to
repel
them
no
amount
of
prevention
will
be
completely
successful
forget
the
fingernail
polish
i
have
finally
settled
upon
a
treatment
that
involves
topical
application
of
a
combination
of
cortisone
creme
reduces
the
inflamation
and
swelling
and
benzocaine
relieves
the
itch
i
wont
tell
you
all
the
things
ive
tried
nor
will
i
tell
you
some
of
the
things
my
wife
does
since
this
counts
as
minor
surgery
and
is
best
not
mentioned
i
also
think
it
gains
nothing
the
swelling
and
itching
can
also
be
significantly
relieved
by
the
application
of
hot
packs
and
this
seems
to
speed
recovery
as
well
doctors
seem
not
to
care
much
about
chiggers
the
urban
and
suburban
doctors
apparently
dont
encounter
them
much
and
the
rural
doctors
seem
to
regard
them
as
a
force
of
nature
that
one
must
endure
i
suspect
that
anyone
who
could
come
up
with
a
good
treatment
for
chiggers
would
make
a

ive
heard

my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
thats
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
menieres
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellowsufferer
is
this
just
keep
searchingdont
let
the
doctors
tell
you
theres
nothing
that

your

let

im

you
are
going

find
some
miracle
with
your

is

slim

then
spending
a
great

energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in

a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to

absolutely

not
the
if
people
are

i
really
wish
they
would
tell
me
first
id
be
happy
to
go
over
the
insert
in
the
pdr
with
them
and
explain
everything
all
too
many
patients
read
the
insert
and
panic
and
then
on
the
next
visit
sheepishly
admit
they
were
afraid
to
take
the
drug
and
we
are
starting
over
again
at
square
one
some
of
them
probably
didnt
even
come
back
for
followup
because
they
didnt
want
to
admit
they
wouldnt
take
the
drug
or
thought
i
was
trying
to
kill
them
or
something
what
people
dont
understand
about
the
inserts
is
that
they
report
every
adverse
side
effect
ever
reported
without
substantiating
that
the
drug
was
responsible
the
insert
is
a
legal
document
to
slough
liability
from
the
manufacturer
to
the
physician
if
something
was
to
happen
if
patients
want
to
have
the
most
useful
and
reliable
information
on
a
drug
they
would
be
so
much
better
off
getting
hold
of
one
of
the
ama
drug
evaluation
books
or
something
similar
that
is
much
more
scientific
there
are
very
few
drugs
that
someone
hasnt
reported
a
death
from
taking
patients
dont
realize
that
and
dont
usually
appreciate
the
risks
to
themselves
properly
im
sure
herman
is
going
to
go
ballistic
but
so
be
it
another
problem
is
that
probably
most
drugs
have
been
reported
to
cause
impotence
half
the
males
who
read
that
will
falsely
assume
it
could
permanently
cause
them
to
lose
sexual
function
and
so
will
refuse
to
take
any
drug
like
that
this
can
be
a
real
problem
for
pdr
readers
there
needs
to
be
some
way
of
providing
patients
with
tools
geared
to
them
that
allow
them
to
get
the
information
they
need
i
am
involved
in
a

project
to
do
that
with
migraine
as
the
domain
it
involves
a
computer
system
that
will
provide
answers
to
questions
about
migraine
as
well
as
the
therapy
prescribed
for
the
patient
for
common
illnesses
such
as
migraine
and
hypertension
this
may
help
quite
a
bit
the
patient
could
spend
as
much
time
as
needed
with
the
computer
and
this
would
then
not
burden
the
physician
clearly
physicians
in
large
part
fail
to
answer
all
the
questions
patients
have
as
is
demonstrated
over
and
over
here
on

where
we
get
asked
things
that
the
patients
should
have
found
out
from
their
physician
but
didnt
why
they
didnt
isnt
always
the
physicians
fault
either
sometimes
the
patients
are
afraid
to
ask
they
wont
be

to
ask
the

multiple

the
difference
now
is
that

the

natural

can

both

cancers
as
well
as
prevent
them
and
also
prevent
and
cure
many
other
medical
problems
including
heart
diseases
they
are
not
too
simple
and
inexpensive
to
work
effectively
besides
acting
on
a

biologically
and
chemically
these
remedies
especially
the
fast
and
the
grape
diet
send
a
strong
message
to
ones
subconscious

programming
it
to
cure
the
cancer
in
my
opinion
if
a
person
finds
out
that
she
has
cancer
then
she
should
promptly
try
at
least
the
first
remedies
described
above
in

my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
thats
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
menieres
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
all
true
and
all
good
points
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellowsufferer
is
this
just
keep
searchingdont
let
the
doctors
tell
you
theres
nothing
that
can
be
donedo
your
own
researchand
let
your
this
may
have
helped
you
but
im
not
sure
it
is
good
general
advice
the
odds
that
you
are
going
to
find
some
miracle
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
general
knowledge
for
this
or
any
other
disease
are
slim
when
good
answers
to
these
then
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in
life
a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
findings
but
not
to
make
a
career
out
of
it
well
making
a
career
out
of
it
is
a
bit
strong
i
still
believe
that
doing
your
own
research
is
very
very
necessary
i
would
not
have
progressed
as
much
as
i
have
today
unless
i
had
spent
the
many
hours
in
stanfords
med
library
as
i
have
done
and
years
ago
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
medicine
that
would
help
me
so
should
i
have
stopped
searching
thank
goodness
i
didnt
now
i
found
that
there
is
indeed
medicine
that
helps
me
i
think
that
what
youve
said
is
kind
of
idealistic
that
you
would
go
to
one
doctor
get
a
diagnosis
maybe
get
a
second
opinion
and
then
move
on
with
your
life
just
as
an
example
having
seen
of
the
top
specialists
in
this
field
in
the
country
i
have
received
different
diagnoses
these
are
the
top
names
the
ones
that
people
come
to
from
all
over
the
country
i
have
had
to
sort
all
of
this
out
myself
going
to
a
support
group
and
in
fact
heading
that
support
group
was
helpful
for
a
while
but
after
a
point
i
found
it
very
unproductive
it
was
much
more
productive
to
do
library
research
make
phone
calls
and
put
together
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
myself
a
recent
movie
lorenzos
oil
offers
a
perfect
example
of
what
im
talking
about
if
you
havent
seen
it
you
should
its
not
a
put
down
of
doctors
and
neither
is
what
im
saying
doctors
are
only
human
and
can
only
do
so
much
but
there
are
those
of
us
out
here
who
are
intelligent
and
able
to
sometimes
find
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
might
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
i
guess
im
biased
because
dizziness
is
one
of
those
weird
things
that
is
still
so
unknown
if
i
had
a
broken
arm
or
a
weak
heart
or
failing
kidneys
i
might
not
have
the
same
opinion
thats
because
those
things
are
much
more
tangible
and
have
much
more
concise
definitions
and
treatments
with
dizziness
you
just
have
to
decide
to
live
with
it
or
decide
to
live
with
it
while
trying
to
find
your
way

hook

are

is
a

capable
of
controlling

even
moving

it

if

you
may
want
to

later

kt
is

a

then
you
can

each

every

the

also
include

others
use

frequently
you
can
be

act
as

by
listening
to
their
warnings
and
taking
breaks
with

i

it
works
as
advertised
i
would
say
it
is
better
for
rsi
prevention
than
rsi
management
because
it
does
not
allow
breaks
at
periods
less
than
minutes
also
it
interrupts
you
based
on
clock
time
rather
than
typing

which
is

cutting

you

even

questionning
your

which
is
that
science
is
merely
a
matter
of
methodology
and
that
the
highest
purpose
of
science
is
to
avoid
making
mistakes
this
is
like
saying
that
the
most
important
aspect
of
business
management
is
accurate
bookkeeping
if
science
were
no
more
than

not
making

it
would

of
the
foregoing
should
be
read

to
practitioners
of
quackery
and
psuedoscience
modern
advocates
of
homeopathy
chiropracty
and
traditional
chinese
medicine
receive
little
respect
because
for
the
most
part
they
use
methods
and
reasoning
that
the
kind
of
research
lee
lady
recommends
has
shown
to
be
terribly
faulty
this
does
not
imply
that
all
their
treatments

it
does
imply
that
those
who
rely
on
faulty
methodology
and

are
incapable
of
discovering
which
treatments
are
effective
and
which
are
not
first
of
all
i
think
you
are
arguing
against
a
straw
man
because
i
dont
think
that
anyone
here
is
arguing
that
quackery
pseudoscience
homeopathy
chiropracty
and
traditional
chinese
medicine
should
be
accepted
as
science
i
in
particular
think
the
basic
ideas
of
homeopathy
and
chiropracty
seem
extremely
flaky
what
some
of
us
do
believe
however
is
that
some
of
these
things
including
some
of
the
flaky
ideas
are
deserving
of
serious
scientific
attention
if
in
fact
it
were
true
as
you
have
stated
above
that
those
who
do
not
use
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
can
have
no
idea
what
is
effective
and
what
is
not
then
science
today
would
not
exist
for
all
of
current
science
is
based
on
the
past
work
of
scientists
whose
methodology
by
current
standards
was
seriously
flawed
it
is
certainly
true
that
as
methodology
improves
we
need
to
reexamine
those
results
derived
in
the
past
using
less
perfect
methodologies
it
is
also
true
that
the
results
obtained
by
people
today
who
still
rely
on
those
early
methodologies
needs
to
be
reexamined
in
a
more
rigorous
fashion
by
those
qualified
to
do
so
credibly
but
to
say
that
nobody
who
fails
to
do
elaborate
doubleblind
studies
is
capable
of
knowing
their
ass
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
to
say
that
no
ideas
that
come
from
outside
the
scientific
establishment
could
possibly
be
worthy
of
serious
investigation
this
truly
marks
ones
attitude
as
doctrinaire
cultist
this
attitude
is
not
compatible
with
a
belief
in
reason
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of

first

of

if

experience
pain
at

you
absolutely
need
to
go

a

between

generally

now
then
problems
come
in
two
main
types
local
conditions
and
diffuse
conditions
local
problems
are
what
youd
expect
specific
muscles
tendons
tendon
sheaths
nerves
etc
being
inflamed
or
otherwise
hurt
diffuse
conditions
often
mistaken
for
local
problems
can
involve
muscle
discomfort
pain
burning
andor
tingling
with
identifiable
areas
of
tenderness
in
muscles
although
theyre
not
necessarily
the
problem
why
does
occupational
overuse
syndrome
occur
heres
the
theory
normally
your
muscles
and
tendons
get
blood
through
capillaries
which
pass
among
the
muscle
fibers
when
you
tense
a
muscle
you
restrict
the
blood
flow
by
the
time
youre
exerting
of
your
full
power
youre
completely
restricting
your
blood
flow
without
fresh
blood
your
muscles
use
stored
energy
until
they
run
out
then
they
switch
to
anaerobic
without
oxygen
metabolism
which
generates
nasty
byproducts
like
lactic
acid
which
cause
pain
once
one
muscle
hurts
all
its
neighbors
tense
up
perhaps
to
relieve
the
load
this
makes
sense
for
your
normal
sort
of
injury
but
it
only
makes
things
worse
with
repetitive
motion
more
tension
means
less
blood
flow
and
the
cycle
continues
another
byproduct
of
the
lack
of
blood
flow
is
tingling
and
numbness
from
your
nerves
they
need
blood
too
anyway
when
youre
typing
too
much
youre
never
really
giving
a
change
for
the
blood
to
get
back
where
it
belongs
because
your
muscles
never
relax
enough
to
let
the
blood
through
stress
poor
posture
and
poor
ergonomics
only
make
things
worse
specific
injuries
you
may
have
heard
of
note
most
injuries
come
in
two
flavors
acute
and
chronic
acute
injuries
are
severely
painful
and
noticable
chronic
conditions
have
less
pronounced
symptoms
but
are
every
bit
as
real
tenosynovitis
an
inflamation
of
the
tendon
sheath
chronic
tenosynovitis
occurs
when
the
repetitive
activity
is
mild
or
intermittent
not
enough
to
cause
acute
inflamation
but
enough
to
exceed
the
tendon
sheaths
ability
to
lubricate
the
tendon
as
a
result
the
tendon
sheath
thickens
gets
inflamed
and
youve
got
your
problem
tendonitis
an
inflammation
of
a
tendon
repeated
tensing
of
a
tendon
can
cause
inflamation
eventually
the
fibers
of
the
tendon
start
separating
and
can
even
break
leaving
behind
debris
which
induces
more
friction
more
swelling
and
more
pain
subacute
tendonitis
is
more
common
which
entails
a
dull
ache
over
the
wrist
and
forearm
some
tenderness
and
it
gets
worse
with
repetitive
activity
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
the
nerves
that
run
through
your
wrist
into
your
fingers
get
trapped
by
the
inflamed
muscles
around
them
symptoms
include
feeling
pins
and
needles
tingling
numbness
and
even
loss
of
sensation
cts
is
often
confused
for
a
diffuse
condition
adverse
mechanical
tension
also
known
as
neural
tension
this
is
where
the
nerves
running
down
to
your
arm
have
become
contracted
and
possibly
compressed
as
a
result
of
muscle
spasms
in
the
shoulders
and
elsewhere
amt
can
often
misdiagnosed
as
or
associated
with
one
of
the
other
oos
disorders
it
is
largely
reversible
and
can
be
treated
with
physiotherapy
brachial
plexus
stretches
and
trigger
point
therapy
others
for
just
about
every
part
of
your
body
theres
a
fancy
name
for
a
way
to
injure
it
by
now
you
should
be
getting
an
idea
of
how
oos
conditions
occur
and
why
just
be
careful
many
inexperienced
doctors
misdiagnose
problems
as
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
when
in
reality
you
may
have
a
completely
different
problem
always
get
a
second
opinion
before
somebody
does
something
drastic
to
you
like
surgery
typing
posture
ergonomics
prevention
treatment
the
most
important
element
of
both
prevention
and
recovery
is
to
reduce
tension
in
the
muscles
and
tendons
this
requires
learning
how
to
relax
if
youre
under
a
load
of
stress
this
is
doubly
important
tune
out
the
world
and
breath
deep
and
regular
relaxing
should
become
a
guiding
principle
in
your
work
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
really
do
it
every
three
minutes
its
also
helpful
to
work
in
comfortable
surroundings
calm
down
and
relax
if
you
cant
sleep
you
really
need
to
focus
on
this
rest
sleep
and
relaxation
are
really
a
big
deal
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
treatments
of
course
drugs
can
reduce
inflamation
and
pain
custommolded
splints
can
forcefully
prevent
bad
posture
surgery
can
fix
some
problems
exercise
can
help
strengthen
your
muscles
regular
stretching
can
help
prevent
injury
good
posture
and
a
good
ergonomic
workspace
promote
reduced
tension
ice
or
hotcold
contrast
baths
also
reduce
swelling
only
your
doctor
can
say
whats
best
for
you
posture
here
are
some
basic
guidelines
i
so
liked
the
way
this
was
written
in
the
new
zealand
book
that
im
lifting
it
almost
verbatim
from
appendix
dwallach
let
your
shoulders
relax
let
your
elbows
swing
free
keep
your
wrists
straight
pull
your
chin
in
to
look
down
dont
flop
your
head
forward
keep
the
hollow
in
the
base
of
your
spine
try
leaning
back
in
the
chair
dont
slouch
or
slump
forward
alter
your
posture
from
time
to
time
every
minutes
get
up
and
bend
your
spine
backward
set
the
seat
height
first
your
feet
should
be
flat
on
the
floor
there
should
be
no
undue
pressure
on
the
underside
of
your
thighs
near
the
knees
and
your
thighs
should
not
slope
too
much
now
draw
yourself
up
to
your
desk
and
see
that
its
height
is
comfortable
to
work
at
if
you
are
short
this
may
be
impossible
the
beest
remedy
is
to
raise
the
seat
height
and
prevent
your
legs
from
dangling
by
using
a
footrest
now
adjust
the
backrest
height
so
that
your
buttocks
fit
into
the
space
between
the
backrest
and
the
seat
pan
the
backrest
should
support
you
in
the
hollow
of
your
back
so
adjust
its
tilt
to
give
firm
support
in
this
area
if
you
operate
a
keyboard
you
will
be
able
to
spend
more
time
leaning
back
so
experiment
with
a
chair
with
a
taller
backrest
if
available
now
i
diverge
a
little
from
the
text
a
good
chair
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
dont
like
your
chair
go
find
a
better
one
you
really
want
adjustments
for
height
back
angle
back
height
and
maybe
even
seat
tilt
most
arm
rests
seem
to
get
in
the
way
although
some
more
expensive
chairs
have
height
adjustable
arm
rests
which
you
can
also
rotate
out
of
the
way
you
should
find
a
good
store
and
play
with
all
these
chairs
pick
one
thats
right
for
you
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
i
highly
recommend
just
chairs
the
name
says
it
all
keyboard
drawers
wrist
pads
and
keyboard
replacements
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
controvery
on
how
to
get
this
right
for
some
people
wrist
pads
seem
to
work
wonders
however
with
good
posture
you
shouldnt
be
resting
your
wrists
on
anything
you
would
prefer
your
keyboard
to
be
right
there
if
you
drop
your
arms
at
your
side
and
then
lift
your
hands
up
at
the
elbow
you
want
your
keyboard
under
your
hands
when
your
elbows
are
at
about
degrees
of
course
you
want
to
avoid
pronation
wrist
extension
and
ulnar
deviation
at
all
costs
wrist
pads
may
or
may
not
help
at
this
you
should
get
somebody
else
to
come
and
look
at
how
you
work
how
you
sit
how
you
type
and
how
you
relax
its
often
easier
for
somebody
else
to
notice
your
hunched
shoulders
or
deviated
hands
some
argue

i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
arguments
about
science
in
scimed
scipsychology
etc
are
not
about
cases
where
people
are
rejecting
scientific
argumentevidenceproof
they
are
about
cases
where
no
adequate
scientific
research
has
been
done
in
some
cases
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
but
it
isnt
in
a
format
to
fit
doctrinaire
conceptions
of
what
science
is
here
it
is
again
this
indicates
confusion
between
proof
and
the
process
of
doing
science
you
are
making
precisely
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make
i
fully
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
the
process
of
science
and
the
end
result
as
an
end
result
of
science
one
wants
to
get
results
that
are
objectively
verifiable
but
there
is
nothing
objective
about
the
process
of
science
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
experiment
and
empirical
studies
are
an
important
part
of
science
but
they
are
merely
the
culmination
of
scientific
research
the
most
important
part
of
true
scientific
methodology
is
scientific
thinking
without
this
one
does
not
have
any
hypotheses
worth
testing
no
hypotheses
do
not
just
leap
out
at
you
after
you
look
at
enough
data
nor
do
they
simply
come
to
you
in
a
flash
one
day
while
youre
shaving
or
looking
out
the
window
at
least
not
unless
youve
done
a
lot
of
really
good
thinking
beforehand
the
difference
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocre
scientist
does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their
empirical
methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
it
bothers
me
even
more
that
there
are
many
fields
such
as
certain
parts
of
psychology
where
there
seems
to
be
no
thinking
at
all
but
mere
studies
testing
ad
hoc
hypotheses
and
im
especially
offended
by
russell
turpins
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesnt
get
you
anywhere
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

hopes
of
finding
someone
out
there
in
network
newsland
who
has
heard
of
something
similar
to
what
i
am
going
to
describe
here
i
have
a
fourteen
year
old
daugter
who
experienced
a
seizure
on
november
at
after
eating
kellogs
frosted
flakes
she
is
perfectly
healthy
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
and
there
is
no
history
of
seizures
in
either
side
of
the
family
all
the
tests
eeg
mri
ekg
came
out
negative
so
the
decision
was
made
to
do
nothing
and
just
wait
to
see
if
it
happened
again
well
we
were
going
along
fine
and
the
other
morning
april
she
had
a
bowl
of
another
kellogs
frosted
kind
of
cereal
fruit
loops
i
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
even
bought
that
junk
but
every
once
in
a
while
so
i
pour
it
in
her
bowl
and
think
oh
oh
this
is
the
same
kind
of
junk
she
was
eating
when
she
had
that
seizure
ten
minutes
later
she
had
a
full
blown
seizures
this
was
her
first
exposure
to
a
sugar
coated
cereal
since
the
last
seizure
when
i
mentioned
what
she
ate
the
first
time
as
a
possible
reason
for
the
seizure
the
neurologist
basically
negated
that
as
an
idea
now
after
this
second
episode
so
similar
in
nature
to
the
first
even
he
is
scratching
his
head
once
again
her
eeg
looks
normal
which
i
understand
can
happen
even
when
a
person
has
a
seizure
once
again
we
are
waiting
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
would
be
good
to
get
to
as
large
a
group
as
possible
to
see
if
anyone
has
any
experience
with
this
kind
of
thing
i
know
that
members
of
the
medical
community
are
sometimes
loathe
to
admit
the
importance
that
diet
and
foods
play
in
our
general
health
and
wellbeing
anyway
as
you
can
guess
i
am
worried
sick
about
this
and
would
appreciate
any
ideas
anyone
out
there
has
sorry
to
be
so
wordy
but
i
wanted
to
really
get
across

is
going

a

cases

extrarational
considerations
driving
science
in
a
useful
direction
for
example
pasteur
discovered
that
racemic
acid
was
a
mixture
of
enantiomers
the
origin
of
stereochemistry
partly
because
he
liked
a
friends
crank
theory
of
chemical
action
the
friend
was
wrong
but
pasteurs
discovery
stood
a
prior
investigator
mitscherlich
looking
at
the
same
phenomenon
had
missed
a
crucial
detail
presumably
because
he
lacked
pasteurs
motivation
to
find
something
that
distinguished
racemic
acid
from
tartaric
now
we
say
dtartaric
acid
again
pasteur
discovered
the
differential
fermentation
of
enantiomers
tartaric
acid
again
not
because
of
some
rational
conviction
but
because
he
was
trying
to
produce
yeast
that
lived
on
ltartaric
acid
his
notebooks
contained
fantasies
of
becoming
the
newton
of
mirrorimage
life
which
he
never
admitted
publically
perhaps
the
best
example
is
the
discovery
that

found
that

this

can
no

simply
turn

we
must
immediately
put

the

come
for

water

to
stop
dragging

and
to

exercise
and
migraine
we
were
talking
about
migraine
and
exercise
im
the
one
who
cant
fathom
the
thought
of
exercise
during
migraine
anyway
turning
the
thread
around
the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
im
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasnt
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this

success
depends
on
how
large
the
fluctuations
in
the
cycle
are
some
people
can
cycle
only
pounds
unfortunately
im
not
one
of
them
this
certainly
describes
my
situation
perfectly
for
me
there
is
a
constant
dynamic
between
my
tendency
to
eat
which
appears
to
be
totally
limitless
and
the
purely
conscious
desire
to
not
put
on
too
much
weight
when
i
get
too
fat
i
just
dietexercise
more
with
varying
degrees
of
success
to
take
off
the
extra
weight
usually
i
cycle
within
a
lb
range
but
smaller
and
larger
cycles
occur
as
well
im
always
afraid
that
this
method
will
stop
working
someday
but
usually
i
seem
to
be
able
to
hold
the
weight
gain
in
check
this
is
one
reason
i
have
a
hard
time
accepting
the
notion
of
some
metabolic
derangement
associated
with
cycle
dieting
that
results
in
longterm
weight
gain
i
have
been
cycle
dieting
for
at
least
years
without
seeing
such
a
change
i
think
a
vigorous
exercise
program
can
go
a
long
way
toward
keeping
the
cycles
smaller
and
the
baseline
weight
low

really

that
in

is

i
turned

two

informed
me
that
homeopaths
dont

stated
this
with

though
it
were
some

why
am

sceptical
about
homeopathy
is
it
because
i

typically
they

not
every
wild

serves

that
when

the
only
one
they

this

does

it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their

it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they

merely
because
they
are
conducting

studies

im

offended

simply

lady
seems

the
contrast

great
science
that
makes
big
advances
in

mediocre
science
that
makes
smaller
steps
in
most
of
this
thread
i
have
been
concerned
with
the
difference
between
what
is
science
and
what
is
not
lee
lady
is
correct
when
she
asserts
that
the
difference
between
einstein
and
the
average
postdoc
physicist
is
the
quality
of
their
thought
but
what
is
the
difference
between
einstein
and
a
genius
who
would
be
a
great
scientist
but
whose
great
thoughts
are
scientifically
screwy
some
would
give
velikovsky
or
korzybski
as
examples
if
you
dont
like
these
choose
your
own
i
say
it
is
the
same
as
the
difference
between
the
mediocre
physicist
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
both
einstein
and
the
mediocre
physcists
have
disciplined
their
work
from
the
cumulative
knowledge
of
how
previous
researchers
went
wrong
both
velikovsky
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
have
failed
to
do
this
let
me
approach
this
from
a
second
direction
when
one
is
asked
to
review
a
paper
for
a
journal
or
conference
there
are
many
kinds
of
criticism

one

kind

is
that

work
is
just
wrong
or
misinformed
another
kind
of
criticism
is
that
the
work
while
technically
correct
is
either
not
important
or
not
interesting
the
first
difference
is
the
one
that
i
have
been
pointing
to
the
second
difference
is
the
one
that
lee
lady
seems
to
be
discussing
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
i
have
often
pointed
out
that
for
homeopathy
to
be
considered
scientific
what
is
needed
is
a
test
of
its
theoretical
claims
not
just
of
some
of
its
proposed
remedies
similarly
i
suspect
that
traditional
chinese
medicine
has
many
remedies
that
work
what
it
lacks
as
one
example
is
any
experiment
that
tests
the
presence
of
qi
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
certainly
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
is
the
goal
in
areas
where
we
do
not
yet
have
this
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
forming
and
testing
smaller
hypotheses
lets
face
it
we
cannot
always
wait
for
an
einstein
to
come
along
and
make
everything
clear
for
us
sometimes
those
of
us
who
are
not
einstein
have
to
plug
along
and
make
small
amounts
of
progress
as
best
we

they

part

there

for

with
no

what
would

would
be
a
theory

that

medical
reality
better
than
the
alternatives
the
central
theoretical
claim
could
lie
forever

there
was

i

much
less
a

that

and
it
is

to
imagine
a
qi
theory
that
would
not

some
way
of
rather
directly

the

of

not
historically
progressed
in

most

the

overall

messy
affair
of
personal
jealousies
crazy

petty

and
the

what
keeps
it

the
critical
function
of

avoiding
mistakes
is
certainly
highly
desirable
however
it
is
also
widely
acknowledged
that
perfectionism
is
inimicable
to
creativity
and
in
ordinary
life
perfectionism
carried
beyond
a
certain
point
is
indicative
of
a
psychological
disorder
in
the
extreme
case
a
perfectionist
becomes
so
paralyzed
by
all
the
possible
mistakes
he
might
make
that
he
is
unable
to
even
leave
the
house
in
science
we
want
to
discover
as
much
truth
about
the
world
as
possible
and
we
also
want
to
have
as
much
certainty
as
possible
about
these
discoveries
usually
there
is
some
tradeoff
between
these
two
desiderata
the
search
for
scope
and
the
search
for
certainty
if
century
mathematicians
had
demanded
total
rigor
from
newton
and
leibniz
then
there
would
probably
be
no
calculus
today
because
neither
of
the
two
could
explain
calculus
in
a
way
that
really
made
sense
since
they
lacked
the
concept
of
a
limit
and
in
fact
because
of
the
lack
of
a
rigorous
foundation
they
made
a
number
of
errors
in
their
use
of
calculus
it
was
only
a
hundred
years
later
that
weistrass
was
able
to
give
a
solid
grounding
for
the
ideas
of
newton
and
leibniz
nonetheless
what
newton
and
leibniz
did
was
undoubtedly
science
and
mathematics
gained
a
great
deal
more
from
the
application
of
their
important
ideas
than
it
lost
through
the
mistakes
they
made

somebody
writes
i
doubt
if
einstein
used
any
formal
methodology
he
also
proposed
numerous
experiments
which
if
performed
would
distinguish
a
universe
in
which
special
relativity
holds
from
one
in
which
it
does
not
einstein
played
by
the
rules
which
demand
that
hypotheses
only
be
put
out
there
if
there
exists
a
specific
experiment
that
could
disprove
them
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
taken
to
the
extreme
i
believe
that
the
attitude
that
empirical
studies
are
everything
and
ideas
are
nothing
results
in
a
complete
stultification
of
science
for
one
thing
an
insistence
on
an
elaborate
and
expensive
methodology
results
in
a
sort
of
scientific
tradeunionism
where
those
outside
the
establishment
and
lacking
institutional
or
corporate
support
have
no
chance
to
obtain
a
hearing
i
dont
in
the
least
believe
that
this
is
the
intention
of
the
arbiters
of
scientific
methodology
nonetheless
it
is
one
of
the
results
and
although
institutional
science
has
certainly
produced
many
wonderful
results
i
think
it
is
a
foolish
arrogance
for
scientists
to
believe
that
no
one
outside
the
establishment
and
using
less
than
perfect
empirical
methodology
will
ever
come
with
anything
worthwhile
furthermore
the
big
bucks
approach
to
science
promotes
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
most
significant
errors
in
science
choosing
to
investigate
questions
because
they
can
be
readily
handled
by
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
or
because
one
can
readily
get
institutional
or
corporate
sponsorship
for
them
instead
of
directing
attention
to
those
questions
which
seem
to
have
fundamental
significance
for
instance
certain
questions
cannot
be
easily
investigated
with
statistical
methods
because
the
relevant
factors
are
not
quantitative
one
could
argue
that
this
is
the
case
for
almost
all
questions
in
many
areas
of
psychology
in
my
opinion
a
perusal
of
many
of
the
papers
resulting
from
the
attempt
by
psychologists
to
force
these
questions
into
a
statistical
framework
gives
the
lie
to
russell
turpins
assertion
that
current
scientific
methods
avoid
all
known
errors
i
think
that
asking
the
wrong
question
is
probably
the
most
fundamental
error
in
science
ignoring
potentially
valuable
ideas
is
one
of
the
others
and
i
think
that
scientific
journals
are
full
of
all
too
many
studies
done
with
impeccable
empirical
methods
but
which
are
worthless
because
the
wrong
question
was
asked
in
the
first
place
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

im
out

it
was

i
got
overheated

dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my

then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in

i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt

and
the

started
although
it
wasnt

is
and
about
that

the

subsided
this
isnt
the

that
ive
had

occur
after

im
wondering

anyone
else
has
had
the

experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the

in
this

heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up

so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get

this
hi

sounds
exactly

same

uselessness
same

in

of

the

i
know

none
have
been

similar
there
is
such
a

variation
between

with

what
causes

that
i
generally
dont

sharing
what
ive
learned
about
mine

since
ours
seem
to
be
alike
here
are
my
observations
i
dont
think
its
heat
per
se
ive
had
more
in
winter
than
summer
dehydration
could
conceivably
figure
though
try
tanking
up
before
playing
rather
than
after
being
in
shape
doesnt
seem
to
help
me
much
either
ive
identified
four
factors
that
do
make
a
difference
listed
in
descending
order
of
importance
heavy
exercise
sleep
deprivation
fasting
eg
skipped
breakfast
physical
trauma
eg
head
bonk
heavy
exercise
has
preceded
all
of
my
postadolescent
migraines
but
i
dont
get
migraines
after
every
heavy
exercise
session
one
or
more
of
the
other
factors
must
be
present
usually
since
i
discovered
this
ive
been
nearly
migrainefree
relapsing
only
once
every
two
or
three
years
when
i
get
cocky
its
been
so
long
maybe
i
just
dont

them
anymore
and
stop
being
careful

psoriatic
arthritis
info
needed
please
a
friend
of
mine
has
been
diagnosed
with
psoriatic
arthritis
as
a
result
of
trauma
sustained
in
a
car
accident
several
years
ago
the
psoriasis
is
under
control
but
the
arthritis
part
of
the
illness
is
not
ansaid
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
worked
pretty
well
for
three
years
but
isnt
helping
much
now
my
friend
is
now
taking
meclomen
another
nsaid
but
this
isnt
helping
control
the
pain
at
all
in
the
past
two
months
my
friend
has
also
started
taking
azulfadine
along
with
the
nsaid
medicines
but
the
effects
of
the
combined
drugs
arent
supposed
to
be
realized
for
several
months
as
a
result
of
the
pain
my
friend
is
having
problems
sleeping
staying
in
one
position
too
long
is
an
ordeal
another
major
contributor
to
pain
is
that
tendonitis
has
now
developed
left
thumb
and
hand
with
numbness
at
the
base
of
the
palm
bottom
of
feet
shoulders
and
outer
thighs
the
tendonitis
is
quite
painful
yet
my
friends
doctor
has
not
recommended
any
form
of
treatment
to
relieve
it
the
latest
twist
is
that
the
doctor
has
dropped
the
antiinflammatories
and
is
now
recommending
prednisone
the
hope
is
that
the
prednisone
will
relieve
some
of
the
pain
from
the
tendonitis
my
friend
is
a
year
old
male
who
feels
like
hes

words
not

anyone
is
aware
of
any
new
treatments
for
psoriatic

it

not

about

such

being

must
not

understanding
all
of
the
differences
in
the
faq
the
vision
was
considered
less
clear
after
the
surgery
than
with
glasses
alone
if
this
is
completly
attributable
to
the
intentional
slight
undercorrection
then
it
can
be
compensated
for
when
necessary
with
glasses
or
contacts
if
they
can
be
worn
afterall
it
is
important
to
know
if
that
is
not
the
case
however
and
some
other
consequence
of
the
surgery
would
often
interfere
with
clear
vision
the
first
thing
that
came

shes
been

eye

and
the
doctors
there
have
no

what
the
actual
cause
is
they
have
apparently
tried
eyedrops
and
such
she
is
just
about
completely
blind
in
one
eye
and
the
other
is
massively
deteriorated
sjogrens
syndrome
has
been
known
to
induce
dryness
in
vaginal
tissue
as
well
as
induce
primary
biliary
cirrhosis
otherwise
the
abdominal
swelling
could
be
due
to
a
complication
of
sjogrens
known
as
pseudolymphoma
which
can
produce
a
splenomegaly
enlarged
spleen
she
should
definitely
see
a

if
this
is
stomach
the
organ
or
stomach
teh
area
of

body
i
guess
the
step
theyre
going
to
take
next
is
to
do
a
whole
battery
of
tests
to
check
all
the
other
internal
systmes
besides
just
the
eyes
but
just
because
the

it
further
at
least
implicitly
advances
the
position
that
sciences
goes

and
it
is
not
clear
what
this
means
given
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
by
generating
in
a
completely
nonrational
and
even
random
way
a
plethora
of
hypotheses
and
theories
that
are
then
weeded
out
via
the
critical
function
of
science
though
why
this
critical
function
should
be
less
subject
to
the
nonrational
forces
is
a
mystery
if
experimental
design
hypotheses
creation
and
theory
construction
are
subject
to
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
then
this
must
be
equally
true

you
may

in

hold
this
view
that
the
common
perhaps
even
the
correct
approach
for
a

to
follow
is
to
sit
around
having
flights
of
fancy
and
scheming
on
the
basis
of
his
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
that
occurs
about
times
in
the
human
genome
unfortunately
for
warrens
fantasy
it
turns
out
to
be
a
transposon
that
is
present
in
so
many
copies
because
it
replicates
itself
and
copies
itself
back
into
the
genome
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristics
of
transposons
were
much
elucidated
the
necessity
of
a
cellular
reverse
transcriptase
was
recognized
and
the
standard
method
of
recognizing
human
dna
was
created
other
species
have
different
sets
of
transposons
fortunately
for
me
warren
and
i
used
to
eat
dinner
at
tgi
fridays
all
the
time
it
further
at
least
implicitly
advances
the
position
that
sciences
goes
forward
and
it
is
not
clear
what
this
means
given
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
by
generating
in
a
completely
nonrational
and
even
random
way
a
plethora
of
hypotheses
and
theories
that
are
then
weeded
out
via
the
critical
function
of
science
im
not
sure
that
its
random
but
there
is
no
known
rational
mechanism
for
generating
a
rich
set
of
interesting
hypotheses
if
you
are
really
working
in
an
unknown
area
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
have
much
sense
of
what
might
or
might
not
be
true
under
those
circumstances
the
best
thing
to
do
is
just
follow
whatever
instincts
you
have
if
they
are
wrong
you
will
find
out
soon
enough
but
at
least
you
will
find
out
something
if
you
try
to
do
experiments
at
random
with
no
prior
conceptions
at
all
in
mind
you
will
probably
get
nowhere
though
why
this
critical
function
should
be
less
subject
to
the
nonrational
forces
is
a
mystery
unfortunately
the
critical
function
does
sometimes
become
hostage
to
nonrational
forces
then
we
get
varieties
of
pathological
science
lysenko
mirskys
opposition
to
dnaasgene
cold
fusion
and
so
forth
if
experimental
design
hypotheses
creation
and
theory
construction
are
subject
to
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
then
this
must
be
equally
true
of
the
application
of
any
critical
function
concerning
replication
this
is
what
leads
one
ala
feyerabend
to
an
anything
goes
view
i
dont
agree
that
this
follows
in
fact
this
is
exactly
the
point
at
which
i
disagree
with
feyerabend
it
is
a
most
important
part
of
the
culture
of
science
that
one
keeps
ones
jealousies
out
of
the
refereeing
process
failures
there
are
aplenty
but
on
the
whole
things
work
out
another
point
there
are
a
couple
of
senses
of
the
phrase
experimental
design
id
say
that
the
less
rational
part
is
in
experimental
choice
not
design

mine

yes

i
think
the

is
it

about

why
such

i
thought
the

were
simmilar
with
the
exception
of
a

being
the
cutting
tool
in

i
must
not

all
of

differences
no
rk
makes

the

was
considered
less

after

with

alone
if
this
is
completly

slight
undercorrection
then
it
can
be
compensated
for

necessary

if
they
can

afterall
it
is
important
to
know
if
that
is
not
the
case
however
and
some
other
consequence
of
the

would
often
interfere
with

the
first
thing
that
came
to
my

was
a
fogging
of
the
lense
which
glasses
couldnt

would
not

find
my

hmmm
the

i
got
stung

i
experienced
the

the

brother
did
we
went
off

the

to
see
if
i
should
worry
about
the
fact
that
my

about
times

itched

he
basically
said
i
shouldnt

that

allergy
was
not
something
you
tended

to

were
something
that
each

got

worse
generally
and
that
next

could
be
the

i
go
into
anaphylactic

admittedly
this
was
many
years

when
i
was
young
since
then
i
just
make
sure
i
dont
get
stung
i
also
should
carry

i
dont
this
isnt

this
would
lead
me
to

just
a

allergies
work
that

people
have

him

was
feeling
worse
i
then
asked
if
perhaps
there
was
a
better
time
for
us
to
talk
when
he
had
more
time
he
responded
just
spit
it
out
now
because
no
time
is
a
good
time
said
in
a
raised
voice
i
started
to
feel
upset
and
tried
to
explain
quickly
what
was
going
on
with
my
condition
but
my
nervousness
interfered
with
my
choice
of
words
and
i
kind
of
stuttered
and
then
said
well
never
mind
and
he
said
hell
talk
to
various
colleagues
about
other
medications
and
hell
call
me
some
other
time
this
doctor
called
me
that
evening
and
said
because
i
didnt
express
myself
well
he
was
confused
about
what
i
wanted
at
this
point
i
was
pretty
upset
and
i
told
him
in
an
amazingly
polite
voice
considering
how
angry
i
felt
that
his
earlier
manner
had
hurt
my
feelings
he
told
me
that
he
just
doesnt
have
time
to
rap
with
patients
and
thought
that
was
what
i
wanted
i
told
him
that
to
assume
i
was
calling
to
rap
was
insulting
and
said
again
that
i
was
just
following
through
on
his
orders
he
responded
that
he
resented
the
implication
that
he
felt
i
was
making
that
he
was
not
interested
in
learning
about
what
his
patients
have
to
say
about
their
condition
status
he
then
gave
me
this
apology
i
am
sorry
that
there
was
a
miscommunication
and
you
mistakenly
thought
i
was
insulting
i
am
not
trying
to
insult
you
but
i
am
not
that
knowledgeable
about
pain
and
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
time
to
deal
with
that
he
then
told
me
to
call
him
the
next
day
for
further
instructions
on
how
do
deal
with
my
pain
and
medication
i
am
still
upset
and
have
not
yet
called
my
questions
should
i
continue
to
have
this
doctor
manage
my
care
since
i
am
in
pain
off
and
on
i
realize
that
this
may
cause
me
to
be
more
anxietous
so
am
i
perhaps
overreacting
or
overly
sensitive
if
this
doctor
refers
me
to
his
colleague
who
knows
more
about
the
type
of
pain
i
have
he
still
wants
me
to
status
him
on
my
condition
but
now
i
am
afraid
to
call
him

it
was

which
from

ive

never

i
went
with

i

thing
i

of
that

was
the

scallops
served
in
the

with
a

i
thought
well
ive
only
had
scallops
once
and
i
was
sick
after
but
that
could
have
been
a
coincidence
that
night
as
i
sat
on
the
bathroom
floor
sweating
and
emptying
my

the
hard
way
i
decided
i
would
never

another

i
may

i

take

i
dont

i

about

collapsed
in

feeling
puffed

tingling
my

too
weak

the

lasted

determined

flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
but
why
do
you
characterize
this
as
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
while
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
scientific
context
here
it
appears
obvious
that
his
speculation
for
lack
of
a
better
or
more
neutral
word
was
at
least
in
significant
part
a
consequence
of
his
knowledge
of
and
acceptance
of
current
theory
coupled
with
his
observations
it
would
appear
that
something
quite
rational
was
going
on
as
he
attempted
to
fit
his
observation
into
that
theory
or
to
tailor
the
theory
to
cover
the
observation
this
does
not
seem
like
an
example
of
what
most
would
normally
call
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
you
mean
by
rational
vs
irrational
perhaps
you
can
give
a
few
examples
of
surprising
experiments
that
were
tried
out
for
perfectly
rational
reasons
or
interesting
new
theories
that
were
first
advanced
from
logical
grounds
the
main
examples
i
can
think
of
are
from
modern
highenergy
physics
which
is
not
typical
of
science
as
a
whole
well
i
think
someone
else
in
this
thread
was
the
first
to
use
the
word
also
extrascientific
etc
nor
am
i
prepared
to
give
a
general
account
of
rationality
in
terms
of
examples
there
is
some
danger
of
beginning
to
quibble
over
what
a
surprising
experiment
is
what
counts
as
surprising
etc
the
same
may
be
said
about
logical
grounds
my
point
is
that
quite
frequently
perhaps
even
most
frequently
the
roots
of
a
new
theory
can
be
traced
to
previously
existing
theories
or
even
to
previously
rejected
hypotheses
of
some
other
theory
or
domain
i
would
offer
some
rather
well
known
examples
such
as
toricellis
puy
de
dome
experiment
done
for
the
sake
of
his
sea
of
air
hypothesis
was
this
theory
and
the
resulting
experimental
test
surprising
well
given
the
prior
explanations
of
the
phenomena
involved
it
certainly
must
be
counted
as
so
was
the
theory
constructed
and
the
experiment
designed
out
of
perfectly
rational
grounds
well
there
was
a
pretty
successful
and
well
know
theory
of
fluids
the
analogy
to
fluids
by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelty
was
in
thinking
of
air
as
a
fluid
but
this
was
quite
a
novelty
at
the
time
was
the
theory
interesting
yes
was
it
new
well
one
could
argue
that
it
was
merely
the
extension
of
an
existing
theory
to
a
new
domain
but
i
think
this
begs
certain
questions

debate

there

check

come
away

in

for
cites
on

look
up
almost
anything
by
john
w
olney
a
toxicologist
who
has
studied
the
effects
of
msg
on
the
brain
and
on
development
it
is
undisputed
in
the
literature
that
msg
is
an
excitotoxic
food
additive
no
its
undisputed
in
the
literature
that
glutamate
is
an
amino
acid
which
is
an
excitatory
neurotransmitter
there
is
also
evidence
that
excessive
release
of
glutamate
may
be
involved
in
the
pathology
of
certain
conditions
like
stroke
drowning
and
lou
gehrigs
disease
just
to
name
a
few
this
is
a
completely
different
issue
than
the
use
of
this
ubiquitous
amino
acid
in
foods
people
are
not
receiving
intraventricular
injections
of
glutamate
and
that
its
major
constituent
glutamate
is
essentially
the
premierie
neurotransmitter
in
the
mammalian
brain
humans
included
i
dont
know
about
premier
but
its
certainly
an
important
one
too
much
in
the
diet
and
the
system
gets
thrown
off
sez
you
such
an
effect
in
humans
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
any
controlled
studies
infant
mice
and
other
models
are
useful
as
far
as
they
go
but
theyre
not
relevant
to
the
matter
at
hand
which
is
not
to
say
that
i
favor
its
use
in
things
like
baby
fooda
patently
ridiculous
use
of
the
additive
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
msg
in
the
diet
effects
humans
adversely
glutamate
and
aspartate
also
an
excitotoxin
are
necessary
in
small
amounts
and
are
freely
available
in
many
foods
but
the
amounts
added
by
industry
are
far
above
the
amounts
that
would
normally
be
encountered
in
a
ny
single
food
wrong
do
you
know
how
much
aspartate
or
phenylalanine
is
in
a
soft
drink
milligrams
worth
compare
that
to
a
glass
of
milk
do
you
know
how
much
glutamate
is
present
in
most
proteincontaining
foods
compared
to
that
added
by
the
use
of
msg
by
eating
lots
of
junk
food
packaged
soups
and

soft

it
is
possible
to
jack

anyone

avoiding
mistakes
is
certainly
highly
desirable
however
it
is
also
widely
acknowledged
that
perfectionism
is
inimicable
to
creativity
in
the
extreme
case

perfectionist
becomes
so
paralyzed
by
all
the
possible
mistakes
he
might
make
that
he
is
unable
to
even
leave
the
house
one
of
the
most
important
and
difficult
aspects
of
reasoning
about
empirical
investigation
lies
in
understanding
the
context
scope
and
importance
of
the
various
arguments
and
pieces
of
evidence
that
are
marshalled
for
a
claim
some
errors
break
the
back
of
a
piece
of
research
some
leave
a
hole
that
needs
to
be
filled
in
and
some
are
trivial
in
their
importance
it
is
a
grave
mistake
to
confuse
these
past
snippets
from
this
thread
i
doubt
if
einstein
used
any
formal
methodology
he
also
proposed
numerous
experiments
which
if
performed
would
distinguish
a
universe
in
which
special

holds
from
one
in
which
it
does
not
back
to
lee
lady
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
these
posters
are
making
the
mistake
that
i
have
previously
criticized
of
adhering
to
a
methodological
recipe
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
is
neither
always
possible
nor
always
important
on
the
other
hand
if
someone
is
proposing
a
remedy
that
supposedly
alleviates
a
chronic
medical
problem
we
have
enough
knowledge
of
the
errors
that
have
plagued
this
kind
of
claim
to
ask
for
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
to
alleviate
our
skepticism
rules
such
as
support
the
hypothesis
by
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
are
too
narrow
to
apply
to
all
investigation
i
think
that
the
requirements
for
particular
reasoning
to
be
convincing
depends
greatly
on
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
past
reasoning
about
the
same
kinds
of
things
to
reuse
the
previous
example
we
know
that
conclusions
from
uncontrolled
observations
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medical
problems
are
notoriously
problematic

why
do
you
characterize

the

by

i
certainly
dont

velikovskian

some
other

i
would
offer
some
rather
well
known
examples
such
as
toricellis
puy

experiment
done
for
the
sake
of
his
sea
of
air
hypothesis
im
not
familiar
with
the
history
of
this
experiment
although
arguably
i
should
be
surprising
well
given
the
prior
explanations
of
the
phenomena
involved
it
certainly
be
counted
as
so
was
the
theory
constructed
and
the
experiment
designed
out
of
perfectly
rational
grounds
well
there
was
a
pretty
successful
and
well
know
theory
of
fluids
the
analogy
to
fluids
by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelty
was
in
thinking
of
air
as
a
fluid
but
this
was
quite
a
novelty
at
the
time
was
the
theory
interesting
yes
was
it
new
well
one
could
argue
that
it
was
merely
the
extension
of
an
existing
theory
to
a
new
domain
but
i
think
this
begs
certain
questions
we
can
debate
that
if
you
like
i
think
that
it
is
enough
if
his
contemporaries
found
the
result
surprising
thats
not
what
id
quibble
about
what
id
like
to
know
are
toricellis
reasons
for
doing
his
experiment
not
the
post
hoc
constructed
reasons
but
the
thoughts
in
his
head
as
he
considered
the
problem
it
may
be
impossible
to
know
much
about
toricellis
thoughts
thats
too
bad
if
it
is
so
one
of
rootbernsteins
services
to
science
is
that
he
has
gone
rooting
about
in
pasteurs
and
flemings
and
other
peoples
notes
and
has
discovered
some
surprising
clues
about
their
motivations

i

posting

in
hopes
of
finding
someone
out
there
in
network
newsland
who
has
heard
of
something
similar
to
what
i
am
going
to
describe
here
i
have
a
fourteen
year
old
daugter
who
experienced
a
seizure
on
november
at
after
eating
kellogs
frosted
flakes
she
is
perfectly
healthy
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
and
there
is
no
history
of
seizures
in
either
side
of
the
family
all
the
tests
eeg
mri
ekg
came
out
negative
so
the
decision
was
made
to
do
nothing
and
just
wait
to
see
if
it
happened
again
well
we
were
going
along
fine
and
the
other
morning
april
she
had
a
bowl
of
another
kellogs
frosted
kind
of
cereal
fruit
loops
i
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
even
bought
that
junk
but
every
once
in
a
while
so
i
pour
it
in
her
bowl
and
think
oh
oh
this
is
the
same
kind
of
junk
she
was
eating
when
she
had
that
seizure
ten
minutes
later
she
had
a
full
blown
seizures
this
was
her
first
exposure
to
a
sugar
coated
cereal
since
the
last
seizure
my
daughter
has
epilepsy
and
i
attend
a
monthly
parent
support
group
just
wednesday
night
a
mother
was
telling
how
she
decided
to
throw
all
the
junk
food
out
and
see
if
it
made
a
difference
in
her
yearolds
seizures
he
was
having
about
one
seizure
per
week
she
reported
that
she
did
this
on
thursday
he
had
a
seizure
on
saturday
and
then
went
weeks
without
a
seizure
on
easter
he
went
to
grandmas
and
ate
candy
pop
anything
he
wanted
he
had
a
seizure
the
next
day
she
sees
sensitivity
to
nutrasweet
sugar
colors
caffine
and
corn
with
corn
she
says
he
gets
very
nervous
and
aggresive
with
my
own
daughter
age
i
think
she
is
also
sensitive
and
stays
away
from
those
foods
on
her
own
she
has
never
had
gum
wont
eat
candy
prefers
an
apple
to
a
cookie
doesnt
like
chocolate
and
wont
even
use
toothpaste
her
brother
on
the
other
hand
is
a
junk
food
addict
hope
this
helps
good
luck

unfortunately
hep

infection
can
eventuate
in
chronic
hepatitis
and
subsequent
cirrhosis
although
not
many
patients
with
hep
b
go
on
to
chronic
hepatitis
it
does
still
occur
in
a
good
number
and
is
something
to
keep
in
mind
hepatitis
c
was
nona
nonb
hep
much
more
frequently
leads
to
chronic
hep
and
cirrhosis
there
is
also
an
autimmune
chronic
hepatitis
that
affects
mostly
younger
women
which
also
leads
to
cirrhosis
of
course
cirrhosis
is
a
most
unkind
disease
the
most
dangerous
effects
relate
to
portal
hypertension
and
loss
of
liver
function
patients
develop
lifethreatening
variceal
bleeds
and
hepatic
comas
among
many
other
problems
as
a
result
of
disturbances
in
hepatic
circulation
less
ominously
they
can
exhibit
the
effects
of
hyperestrogenemia
which
often
characterize
patients
with
cirrhosis
these
effects
include
telangiactasias
small
red
skin
lesions
and
in
men
gynecomastia
breast
development
the
only
real
treatment
for
cirrhosis
is
liver
transplant
keep
in
mind
that
cirrhosis
is
not
expected
at
least
statistically
in
your
friends
case
nevertheless
you
might
want
to
bring
up
the
subject
of
chronic

with

the

the

negated
that

after

so
similar

even
sp
he

theres
no

that
sugarcoated
cereals
cause
seizures
i
havent

anything
anecdotal
on
it

how

do

also
theres
nothing

in
those
cereals
as

as
the

those

in
mind
yes
absolutely
though
id
make
the
observation
in
a
more
general
sense
of
all
observations
are
made
by
human
beings
and
therefore
made
with
various
biases
but
here
your
message
leaves
talk
of
hypothesis
and
gets
back
once
again
to
equating
the
business
of
science
with
the
end
result
the
gizmo
produced
science
works
very
well
at
developing
theories
within
paradigms
but
is
very
poor
at
dealing
with
paradigm
shifts
if
i
develop
a
novel
paradigm
that
explains
homeopathy
chinese
medicine
or
spontaneous
combustion
if
the
paradigm
is
useful
it
will
show
me
the
way
to
make
observations
that
prove
or
disprove
it
my
point
isnt
so
much
whether
or
not
you
have
a
novel
paradigm
but
how
you
come
about
developing
it
the
paradigm
of
modern
medicine
is
that
the
body
can
be
reduced
to
a
set
of
essentially
mechanical
operations
wherein
disease
is
seen
as
malfunctions
in
the
machinery
essentially
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
it
seems
likely
that
theories
based
upon
this
paradigm
do
not
give
a
complete
discription
of
the
universe
medicine
healing
etc
indeed
we
now
recognize
an
important
psychological
component
to
healing
perhaps
youd
admit
that
this
is
an
oversimplification
on
your
part
the
topic
of
the
philosophy
of
science
is
made
for
them
im
making
them
too
but
i
think
that
it
also
summarizes
popular
misconceptions
of
science
and
the
business
of
doing
science
biomedical
research
doesnt
make
any
basic
assumptions
that
arent
the
same
as
any
other
discipline
of
scientific
research
that
is
that
you
make
empirical
observations
form
an
hypothesis
and
test
it
modern
medicine
has
much
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
and
i
doubt
that
many
psychologists
would
appreciate
being
put
outside
this
empirical
world
view
psychology
also
has
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
spoon
bending
it
is
also
important
to
distinguish
reason
from
science
science
may
be
reasonable
but
so
are
many
nonscientific
methodologies
aristotle
reasoned
that
frogs
came
from
mud
by
observing
one
hop
out
of
a
puddle
oversimplified
of
course
but
a
good
example
this
is
an
empirical
observa
tion
it
was
then
tested
though
perhaps
not
by
aristotle
and
eventually
found
wanting
in
the
meantime
some
folk
will
have
continued
to
believe
in
the
spontaneous
generation
of
animal
life
theres
nothing
at
all
surprising
about
this
its
the
way
the
gathering
of
knowledge
works
there
are
probably
more
than
a
few
things
in
my
own
discipline
of
molecular
biology
that
will
be
found
to
be
totally
offbase
even
idiotic
to
someone
in
the
future
these
future
people
wont
have
come
to
these
relevations
because
they
had
suddenly
gone
all
zenlike
and
had
a
vision
in
an
lsd
trip
someone
will
have
thought
of
something
new
and
tested
it
this
is
the
bit
that
people
who
seem
to
relish
misrepresenting
science
and
research
cant
seem
to
wrap
their
minds

science
is
a

process
what
i

and
good
research
can
be
totally
turned
on
its
head
tommorrow
by
new
results
and
theories
again
i
think
it
gets
down
to
defining
what
you
mean
by
science
i
often
dont
recognize
what
it
is
that
i
do
and
am
involved
in
in
the
way
science
is
portrayed
by
popular

of
people
in
the
humanities
they
portray
science
as
a
collection
of
immutable
facts
pronouncements
of
truth
in
big
gold
letters
thats
silly
its
as
though
we
just
go

turn
over

stone
and
come
up
with

mechanism
for

my

cannot

in

three

she
tried

have
her
bone
marrow
typed
and
they
wouldnt
even
do
that
why
i
cant
donate
blood
either
because
not
only
have
i
been
to
a
malarial
region
but
i
have
also
been
diagnosed
and
surgically
treated
for
testicular
cancer
the
blood
bank
wont
accept
blood
from
me
for
years
obviously
it
wouldnt
be
of
much
help
to
treat
one
problem
by
knowingly
introducing
another
cancer
mestastizes
my
imperfect
understanding
of

are
that
gonadal
cancer
is

dangerous
in
this

i
havent

the

on
it
but
i
dont
recall
ever
hearing
of
a
case
of
cancer
being
transmitted
by
a
blood

probably
just
a
common
sense
kind
of
arbitrary
precaution
transmissable
diseases

malaria
though
are

friend

a
friend
of
mine
is
having
some
symptoms
and
has
asked
me
to
post
the
following
information
a
few
weeks
ago
she
noticed
that
some
of
her
hair
was
starting
to
fall
out
she
would
touch
her
head
and
strands
of
hair
would
just
fall
right
out
by
the
way
she
is
or
years
old
it
continued
to
occur
until
she
had
a
bald
spot
about
the
size
of
a
half
dollar
since
that
time
she
has
gotten
two
more
bald
spots
of
the
same
size
other
symptoms
shes
described
include
several
months
of
an
irregular
menstrual
cycle
which
is
strange
for
her
because
she
has
always
been
extremely
regular
laryngitis
every
few
days
she
will
wake
up
one
morning
and
have
almost
no
voice
and
then
the
next
day
its
fine
dizzy
spells
she
claims
that
shes
had
or
very
bad
dizzy
spells
early
in
the
morning
including
one
that
knocked
her
to
the
ground
and
general
fatigue
she
went
to
a
dermatologist
first
who
couldnt
find
any
reason
for
the
symptoms
and
sent
her
to
an
internist
who
suspected
thyroid
problems
he
did
the
blood
work
and
claims
that
everything
came
back
normal
shes
very
concerned
and
very
confused
does
anyone
have
any
ideas
or
suggestions
i
told
her
that
i
thought
she
should
see
an
endocrinologist
does
that
sound
like
the
right
idea
by
the
way
in
case
you
are
going
to
askno
she
has
recently
taken
any
medications
that
would
cause
these
symptomsno
she
hasnt
recently
changed
her
hair
products
and
she
hasnt
gotten
a
perm
coloring

other
chemical
process
that
might

hair

thus
i

have
been
contemplating
this
idea
for
some
time
as
well
i
am
not
a
doctor
but
my
wife
is
a
nurse
and
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
and
nurses
the
point
here
being
that
doctors
and
nurses
do
not
seem
to
get
sick
nearly
as
much
as
people
outside
the
medical
profession
this
is
a
lovely
area
for
anecdotes
but
i
am
sure
you
are
on
to
something
as
a
physician
i
almost
never
get
sick
usually
when
something
horrendous
is
going
around
i
either
dont
get
it
at
all
or
get
a
very
mild
case
when
i
do
get
really
sick
it
is
always
something
unusual
this
was
not
the
situation
when
i
was
in
medical
school
particularly
on
pediatrics
i
never
had
younger
siblings
myself
and
when
i
went
on
the
pediatric
wards
i
suddenly
found
myself
confronting
all
sorts
of
infectious
challenges
that
my
body
was
not
ready
for
pediatrics
for
me
was
three
solid
months
of
illness
and
i
had
a
temp
of
when
i
took
the
final
exam
i
think
what
happens
is
that
during
training
and
beyond
we
are
constantly
exposed
to
new
things
and
we
have
the
usual
reactions
to
them
so
that
later
on
when
challenged
with
something
it
is
more
likely
a
reexposure
for
us
so
we
deal
with
it
well
and
get
a
mild
illness
i
dont
think
it
is
that
the
immune
system
is
hyped
up
in
any
way
also
dont

what

with

is
that

you
may
not
in

hold
this
view
that
the
common
perhaps
even
the
correct
approach
for
a

to
follow
is
to
sit
around
having
flights

and
scheming
on
the
basis
of
his
jealousies
and
petty

flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are

the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
the
danger
in
philosophizing
about
science
is
that
theory
and
generalization
can
end
up
being
far
removed
from
the
actual
daytoday
of
the
grunt
at
the
bench
yes
its
great
to
be
involved
in
a
process
were
i
can
walk
into
the
lab
after
a
heavy
night
of
dreaming
and
just
do
something
for
the
hell
of
it
as
long
as
my
advisor
doesnt
catch
me
which
is
easy
enough
to
do
but
stamping
out
such
behavior
seems
to
be
the
purpose
in
life
of
grant
review
committees
and
the
peer
review
process
in
general
in
todays
world
thats
what
determines
what
science
is
what
gets
funded
and
a
damn
good
thing
to
flights
of
fantasy
just
dont
have
much
chance
of
producing
anything
at
least
not
in
biomedical
research
the
surest
way
for
a
graduate
student
to
ruin
their
life
is
to
work
in
a
lab
where
the
boss
is
more
concerned
with
fleshing
out
hisher
fantasies
than
with
having
the
student
work
on
a
project
that
actually
has
a
good
chance
of
producing
some
results
mds
seem
to
be
particularly
prone
to
this
aberrant
behavior
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
that
occurs
about
times
in
the
human
genome
unfortunately
for
warrens
fantasy
it
turns
out
to
be
a
transposon
that
is
present
in
so
many
copies
because
it
replicates
itself
and
copies
itself
back
into
the
genome
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristics
of
transposons
were
much
elucidated
the
necessity
of
a
cellular
reverse
transcriptase
was
recognized
and
the
standard
method
of
recognizing
human
dna
was
created
other
species
have
different
sets
of
transposons
fortunately
for
me
warren
and
i
used

eat

all

i
have

turned

my
year
old
pomeranian
had
a
nasty
reaction
to
this
vaccination
suffice
it
to
say
we
will
not
vaccinate
her
for
lyme
disease
again
shes
been
camping
through
some
states
and
has
backpacked
with
us
as
well
and
we
are
used
to
watching
for
ticks
and
dealing
with
them
and
we
simply
wont
take
her
to
really
active
lyme
disease
areas
not
to
drag
this
out
anymore
but
many
veterinarians
feel
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
is
so
easy
to
treat
that
in
an
endemic
area
they
often
just
give
the
appropriate
antibiotics
to
dogs
presenting
with
lameness
swollen
joints
fever
a
recent
paper
march
has
finally
established
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
can
be
reproduced
in
a
controlled
experimentaly
setting
this
has
been
an
ellusive
matter
for
researchers
and
is
one
of
the
fundamental
requirements
for
many
to
acknowledge
an
agent
as
being
causitive
of
a
particular
disease
up
to
now
only
the
vaccine
manufacturer
has
been
able
to
prove
that
the
disease
exists
this
paper
is
noteworthy
in
two
other
regards
none
of
the
animals
they
infected
were
treated
in
any
way
the
dogs
had
episodes
of
lameness
during
a
week
period
which
occurred
months
after
exposure
after
this
period
none
showed
any
further
clinical
signs
up
to
the
month
observation
period
of
the
study
so
these
are
proven
clinically
sick
lyme
patients
showing
spontaneous
recovery
without
the
benefit
of
drug
treatment
of
course
observations
longer
than
months
will
be
necessary
to
be
sure
the
disease
doesnt
have
the
same
chronicity
that
some
see
in
humans
the
addendum
to
the
paper
calls
into
question
the
techniques
used
by
the
vaccine
manufacturer
to
validate
the
vaccine
of
course
they
want
the
world
to
use
the
model
they
developed
in
order
to
test
vaccine
efficacy
anyway
maybe
we
will
see
some
independent
scientifically
sound
evaluations
of
this
vaccine
in
the
next
year

i

else
as
ive
never

it
also
helps
build

maintain

prevent

increase

even
so
my

im
most
comfortable

and
usually
wear
a

if
it
drops

me
to
avoid
every
excess
ounce
cyclists
routinely
pay
a
premium
for
cycling
products
that
weigh
slightly
less
than
others
but
its
easier
and
cheaper
to
trim
weight
from
the
rider
than
from
the

theres
no
question
in
my
mind
that
my

is
radically
different
from
that
of
most
people
who
have
never
been

fortunately
it
isnt

in
a
way
that
precludes

obviously
i

every

does

will
have
the

i

ive
never
yet
heard
of
one
who
did

all

success

the

the

no

already
knows
that
some

think
chinese

is

placebos
are
all
very
interesting

irrelevant

have
you

look
up
almost
anything
by
john

olney
a
toxicologist
who
has
studied
the
effects
of
msg
on
the
brain
and
on

it
is
undisputed
in

that

is
an
excitotoxic
food
additive
no
its
undisputed
in
the

that
glutamate
is
an
amino

which
is
an
excitatory
neurotransmitter
there
is
also
evidence
that
excessive
release
of

may
be
involved
in
the
pathology
of
certain
conditions
like
stroke
drowning

just
to

a

this
is
a
completely

people

not

tests
have
been
done
on

not

method
for

for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not

that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with

bunk
too
much

and
the

gets
thrown

sez
you
such

has
not

infant
mice

are
useful
as
far
as

theyre
not
relevant

matter
at

which
is
not
to

that
i
favor
its
use
in
things
like
baby

patently
ridiculous
use

we
have
no

where

youre
right

four

proteincontaining

compared

the

re
what
are
the
problems
with
nutrasweet
aspartame
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
phenylalanine
is
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
it
is
an
amino
acid
and
everyone
uses
small
quantities
of
it
for
protein
synthesis
in
the
body
some
people
have
a
disease
known
as
phenylketoneurea
and
they
are
missing
the
enzyme
necessary
to
degrade
this
compound
and
eliminate
it
from
the
body
for
them
it
will
accumulate
in
the
body
and
in
high
levels
this
is
toxic
to
growing
nerve
cells
therefore
it
is
only
a
major
problem
in
young
children
until
around
age
or
so
or
women
who
are
pregnant
and
have
this
disorder
it
used
to
be
a
leading
cause
of
brain
damage
in
infants
but
now
it
can
be
easily
detected
at
birth
and
then
one
must
simply
avoid
comsumption
of
phenylalanine
as
a
child
or
when
pregnant

few
years

about
a

involved
aggressively
eliminating
artificial

from
the

the
theory
which
was
backed
up

is
that
certain

are
just
way
more
sensitive
to
these

i

in

continue

the

lap

flights

the
crucial
thing
is
not

sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use

they

you
do
some
experiments

warren

extremely

of
human
alu
fragments
he

very

why
do
you
characterize
this
as
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
while
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
scientific
context
here
it
appears
obvious
that
his
speculation
for
lack
of
a
better
or
more
neutral
word
was
at
least
in
significant
part
a
consequence
of
his
knowledge
of
and
acceptance
of
current
theory
coupled
with
his
observations
it
would
appear
that
something
quite
rational
was
going
on
as
he
attempted
to
fit
his
observation
into
that
theory
or
to
tailor
the
theory
to
cover
the
observation
whether
a
scientific
idea
comes
while
one
is
staring
out
the
window
or
dreaming
or
having
a
fantasy
or
watching
an
apple
fall
newton
or
sitting
in
a
bath
archimedes
it
is
ultimately
the
result
of
a
lot
of
intense
scientific
thinking
done
beforehand
letting
ones
mind
roam
freely
and
giving
rein
to
ones
intuition
can
be
a
useful
way
of
coming
up
with
new
ideas
but
only
when
one
has
done
a
lot
of
rational
analysis
of
the
problem
first
scientific
intuition
is
not
something
one
is
born
with
it
is
something
that
one
learns
maybe
we
dont
understand
completely
how
it
is
learned
but
training
in
systematic
scientific
thinking
is
certainly
one
of
the
key
elements
in
developing
it
informal
exploration
is
also
often
an
important
element
in
finding
new
scientific
ideas
one
thinks
for
instance
of
darwins
naturalistic
studies
in
the
galapagos
islands
which
led
him
to
the
ideas
for
the
theory
of
evolution
this
is
why
i
am
offended
by
a
definition
of
science
that
emphasizes
empirical
verification
and
does
not
recognize
thinking
and
informal
exploration
as
important
scientific
work
i
agree
that
mere
speculation
does
not
deserve
to
be
called
science
i
also
think
that
mere
empirical
studies
not
directed
by
good
scientific
thinking
are
at
best

very
poor
kind

wednesday
april
k
of
c
uniondale
last
meeting
it
has
been
noted
here
before
that
the
long
island
chapter
of
trio
has
extraordinary
power
in
predicting
bad
weather
being
able
to
forecast
rain
sleet
and
snow
fully
a
month
in
advance
no
tv
weatherman
can
match
us
this
time
we
not
only
scored
again
but
we
were
also
able
to
disable
the
long
island
railroad
making
travel
really
difficult
none
the
less
many
braved
the
snow
and
we
had
an
interesting
meeting
and
good
conversation
our
scheduled
speaker
mrs
elizabeth
linnehan
a
professional
nutritionist
had
a
family
emergency
and
was
not
able
to
attend
she
hope
she
will
be
with
us
in
the
fall
to
discuss
diet
and
medications
however
ms
jennifer
friedman
an
image
consultant
and
sister
of
a
liver
transplant
recipient
was
kind
enough
to
step
in
on
very
short
notice
ms
friedman
gave
us
a
lot
of
good
advice
about
choosing
clothes
and
makeup
even
a
bit
for
men
to
help
us
look
well
and
healthy
and
to
minimize
some
of
the
cosmetic
effects
of
some
of
the
medicine
and
drugs
we
take
we
are
most
grateful
to
jennifer
and
thank
her
for
an
entertaining
evening
annual
meeting
in
addition
to
welcoming
dr
teperman
the
april
meeting
is
also
the
annual
meeting
of
the
chapter
this
is
the
official
notice
of
the
meeting
as
required
by
our
bylaws
the
main
purpose
of
the
meeting
is
to
review
the
past
year
solicit
member
views
and
ideas
for
better
ways
to
meet
their
needs
and
to
elect
members
of
the
board
of
directors
for
the
coming
two
year

the
nominating
committee
has
prepared
the
following
slate

walter
ruzak
kidney

this
may
seem
to
be
a
big
board
but
many
hands
make
light
work
and
with
our
various
medical
uncertainties
it
is
good
to
have
backups
for
all
the
jobs
on
the
board
therefore
in
addition
to
the
slate
being
presented
for
voting
nominations
will
also
be
accepted
from
the
floor
there
is
no
set
number
of
board
members
and
there
is
plenty
of
work
in
addition
brief
treasurers
and
membership
reports
will
be
given
and
the
floor
will
be
open
for
any
new
business
suggestions
or
comments
anyone
would
like
to
bring
up
we
will
keep
the
formal
meeting
short
so
that
we
can
spend
the
majority
of
the
time
with
dr

because
of
two
years
experience
with
miserable
weather
we
all
can
help
spread
the
word
on
donor

however
we
have
found
it
effective
to
ask
your
pastor
or
rabbi
to
publish
a
letter
or
announcement
in
the
parish
bulletin
allow
you
to
address
the

re
what
are
the
problems
with
nutrasweet
aspartame
in
article
hbloommooseuvmedu
heather
writes
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
aspartame
is
the
methyl
ester
of
a
dipeptide
so
a
product
of
its
hydrolysis
is
going
to
be
methanol
which
can
then
be
oxidized
to
formaldehyde
the
amounts
of
methanol
formed
from
the
ingestion
of
aspartamecontaining
foods
are
completely
in
the
metabolic
noise
since
youre
forming
equally
minute
amounts
of
methanol
from
other
components
of
food
all
the
time
in
studies
involving
administration
of
high
doses
of
the
additive
blood
methanol
levels
were
undetectable
methanol
is
a
poison
only
in
quantities
seen
in
human
poisonings
say
and
above
this
is
a
consequence
of
its
oxidation
to
formaldehyde
and
formic
acid
two
quite
reactive
compounds
which
at
high
enough
levels
can
damage
tissues
like
the
retina
and
kidney
because
at
such
high
doses
the
bodys
detoxification
system
is
overwhelmed
interestingly
one
treatment
for
early
methanol
poisoning
is
to
get
the
person
drunk
on
ethyl
alcoholvodka
or
an
equivalent
thats
because
ethanol
is
metabolized
preferentially
over
methanol
by
the
enzymes
in
the
liver
if
the
methanol
stays
as
methanol
and
isnt
metabolized
to
formaldehyde
it
is
actually
relatively
nontoxic

many
people
responded
with
more
anecdotal
stories
i
think
its
safe
to
say
the
original
poster
is
already
familiar
with
such
stories
presumably
he
wants
hard
info
to
substantiate
or
refute
claims
about
msg
making
people
ill
there
has
been
no
hard
info
provided
about
msg
making
people
ill
thats
the
point
after
all
like
youself
someone
who
can
read
a
scientific
paper
and
apparently
come
away
from
it
with
bizarrely
cracked
ideas
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
this
substance
in
human
nutrition
have
you
read
olneys
work
i
fail
to
see
how
citing
results
from
peerreviewed
studies
qualifies
as
bizarrely
cracked
thats
because
these
peerreviewed
studies
are
not
addressing
the
effects
of
msg
in
people
theyre
looking
at
animal
models
you
cant
walk
away
from
this
and
start
ranting
about
gloom
and
doom
as
if
there
were
any
documented
deleterious
health
effects
demonstrated
in
humans
note
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
argument
with
a
statement
like
noting
that
animal
administration
has
pro
duced
the
following
blah
blah
we
must
be
careful
about
its
use
in
humans
this
is
precisely
not
what
you
said
tests
have
been
done
on
rhesus
monkeys
as
well
i
have
never
seen
a
study
where
the
mode
of
administration
was
intraventricular
the
glu
and
asp
were
administered
orally
some
studies
used
iv
and
sc
intraventricular
is
not
a
normal
admin
method
for
food
tox
studies
for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not
have
read
the
peerreviewed
works
that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with
this
brain
injection
bunk
it
most
certainly
is
for
neurotoxicology
you
know
studies
of
glutamate
involve
more
than
food
science
pardon
me
but
where
are
you
getting
this
from
have
you
read
the
journals
have
you
done
a
thorough
literature
search
so
point
us
to
the
studies
in
humans
please
im
familiar
with
the
literature
and
ive
never
seen
any
which
relate
at
all
to
olneys
work
in
animals
and
the
effects
of
glutamate
on
neurons
the
point
is
exceeding
the
window
of
course
theyre
amino
acids
note
that
people
with
pku
cannot
tolerate
any
phenylalanine
well
actually
they
have
to
tolerate
some
phenylalanine
its
a
essential
amino
acid
they
just
try
to
get
as
little
as
is
healthy
without
producing
dangerous
levels
of
phenylalanine
and
its
metabolites
in
the
blood
olneys
research
compared
infant
human
diets
specifically
the
amount
of
freely
available
glu
in
mothers
milk
versus
commercial
baby
foods
vs
typical
lunch
items
from
the
standard
american
diet
such
as
packaged
soup
mixes
he
found
that
one
could
exceed
the
projected
safety
margin
for
infant
humans
by
at
least
fourfold
in
a
single
meal
of
processed
foods
mothers
milk
was
well
below
the
effective
dose
goodness
im
not
saying
that
its
good
to
feed
infants
a
lot
of
glutamatesupplemented
foods
its
just
that
this
projected
safety
margin
is
a
construct
derived
from
animal
models
and
given
that
you
can
prove
anything
you
like
were
talking
prudent
policy
in
infant
nutrition
here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as
received
wisdom
read
olneys
review
paper
in
prog
brain
res
and
check
his
sources
they
are
impecable
there
is
no
dispute
impeccable
there
most
certainly
is
a
dispute
between
who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide
peerreviewed
nonfoodindustryfunded
citations
to
articles
disputing
that
msg
has
no
effects
whatsoever
you
mean
asserting
youre
being
intellectually
dishonest
or
just
plain
confused
because
youre
conflating
reports
which
do
not
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
olneys
reports
would
argue
a
potential
for
problems
in
human
infants
but
thats
not
to
say
that
this
says
anything
whatsoever
about
the
use
of
msg
in
most
foods
nor
does
he
provide
any
studies
in
humans
which
indicate
any
deleterious
effects
for
obvious
reasons
it
says
nothing
about
msgs
contribtion
to
the
phenomenon
of
the
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
it
says
nothing
about
the
frequent
inability
to
replicate

in

robert

does
anyone
know
of
any
method
to
reduce
this
frequency
my
younger
brothers
each
tried
a
skin
transplant
thigh
to
nose
lining
but
their
nosebleeds
soon
returned
ive
seen
a
reference
to
an
herb
called
rutin
that
is
supposed
to
help
and
id
like
to
hear
of
experiences
with
it
or
other
techniques
rutin
is
a
bioflavonoid
compounds
found
among
other
places
in
the
rinds
of
citrus
fruits
these
have
been
popular
especially
in
europe
to
treat
capillary
fragility
and
seemingly
in
even
more
extreme
cases
a
few
months
ago
a
friend
was
visiting
from
italy
and
he
said
that
hed
had
hemorrhoids
but
his
pharmacist
friend
sold
him
some
pills
incredulously
i
asked
to
look
at
them
and
sure
enough
these
contained
rutin
as
the
active
ingredient
i
probably
destroyed
the
placebo
effect
from
my
skeptical
sputtering
i
have
no
idea
how
hes
doing
hemorrhoidwise
these
days
the
studies
which
attempted
to
look
at
the
effect
of
these
compounds
in
human
disease
and
nutrition
were
never
very
well
controlled
so
the
reports
of
positive
results
with
them
is
mostly
anecdotal
this
stuff
is
pretty
much
nontoxic
and
probably
inexpensive
so
theres
little
risk
of
trying
it
but
i
wouldnt
expect
much
of
a
result

i
agree
with
everything
that
lee
lady
wrote
in
her
previous
post
in
this
thread
gee
maybe
ive
misjudged
you
russell
anyone
who
agrees
with
something
i
say
cant
be
all
bad
seriously
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudged
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insistence
that
science
is
mainly
about
avoiding
mistakes
and
i
still
disagree
with
your
contention
that
nobody
who
doesnt
use
methods
deemed
scientific
can
possibly
know
whats
true
and
whats
not
deleted
material
which
i
agree
with
back
to
lee
lady
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
these
posters
are
making
the
mistake
that
i
have
previously
criticized
of
adhering
to
a
methodological
recipe
a
carefully
rules
such
as
support
the
hypothesis
by
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
are
too
narrow
to
apply
to
all
investigation
i
think
that
the
requirements
for
particular
reasoning
to
be
convincing
depends
greatly
on
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
past
reasoning
about
the
same
kinds
of
things
to
reuse
the
previous
example
we
know
that
conclusions
from
uncontrolled
observations
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medical
problems
are
notoriously
problematic
okay
so
lets
see
if
we
agree
on
this
first
of
all
there
are
degrees
of
certainty
it
might
be
appropriate
for
instance
to
demand
carefully
controlled
trials
before
we
accept
as
absolute
scientific
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highly
favorable
clinical
experience
even
if
uncontrolled
can
be
adequate
to
justify
a
preliminary
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
useful
this
is
often
the
best
evidence
we
can
hope
for
from
investigators
who
do
not
have
institutional
or
corporate
support
in
this
case
it
makes
sense
to
tentatively
treat
claims
as
credible
but
to
reserve
final
judgement
until
establishment
scientists
who
are
qualified
and
have
the
necessary
resources
can
do
more
careful
testing
secondly
it
makes
sense
to
be
more
tolerant
in
our
standards
of
evidence
for
a
pronounced
effect
than
for
one
that
is
marginal
i
come
to
this
dispute
about
what
science
is
not
only
as
a
mathematician
but
as
a
veteran
of
many
arguments
in
scipsychology
and
occasionally
in
scimed
about
nlp
neurolinguistic
programming
much
of
the
work
done
to
date
by
nlpers
can
be
better
categorized
as
informal
exploration
than
as
careful
scientific
research
for
years
now
i
have
been
trying
to
get
scientific
and
clinical
psychologists
to
just
take
a
look
at
it
to
read
a
few
of
the
books
and
watch
some
of
the
videotapes
courtesy
of
your
local
university
library
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
definitive
judgement
but
simply
to
look
at
the
nlp
methodology
especially
the
approach
to
eliciting
information
from
subjects
and
look
for
ideas
and
hypotheses
which
might
be
of
scientific
interest
and
most
especially
to
be
aware
of
the
questions
nlp
suggests
which
might
be
worthy
of
scientific
investigation
over
and
over
again
the
response
i
get
in
scipychology
is
if
this
hasnt
been
thoroughly
validated
by
the
accepted
form
of
empirical
research
then
it
cant
be
of
any
interest
to
us
to
me
the
ultimate
reducio
ad
absurdum
of
the
extreme
thereve
got
to
be
controlled
studies
position
is
an
nlp
technique
called
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
simple
phobias
as
opposed
to
agoraphobia
may
not
be
the
worlds
most
important
psychological
disorder
but
the
nice
thing
about
them
is
that
it
doesnt
take
a
sophisticated
instrument
to
diagnose
them
or
tell
when
someone
is
cured
of
one
the
nlp
phobia
cure
is
a
simple
visualization
which
requires
less
than
minutes
nlpers
claim
that
it
can
also
be
used
to
neutralize
a
traumatic
memory
and
hence
is
useful
in
treating
posttraumatic
stress
syndrome
it
is
essentially
a
variation
on
the
classic
desensitization
process
used
by
behavioral
therapists
a
subject
only
needs
to
be
taken
through
the
technique
once
or
in
the
case
of
ptsd
once
for
each
traumatic
incident
the
process
doesnt
need
to
be
repeated
and
the
subject
doesnt
need
to
practice
it
over
again
at
home
now
to
me
it
seems
pretty
easy
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
this
cure
especially
if
as
nlpers
claim
the
success
rate
is
extremely
high
take
someone
with
a
fear
of
heights
as
i
used
to
have
take
them
up
to
a
balcony
on
the
floor
and
observe
their
response
spend
minutes
to
have
them
do
the
simple
visualization
send
them
back
up
to
the
balcony
and
see
if
things
have
changed
check
back
with
them
in
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
the
cure
seems
to
be
lasting
more
long
term
followup
is
certainly
desirable
but
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
even
a
cure
that
lasts
several
weeks
has
significance
in
any
case
there
are
many
known
cases
where
the
cure
has
lasted
years
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
is
no
known
case
where
the
cure
has
been
reversed
after
holding
for
a
few
weeks
my
own
cure
incidentally
was
done
with
a
slightly
different
nlp
technique
before
i
learned
of
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
ten
years
later
now
i
enjoy
living
on
the
floor
of
my
building
and
having
a
large
balcony
the
folks
over
in
scipsychology
have
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
not
to
make
this
simple
test
they
claim
that
only
an
elaborate
outcome
study
will
be
satisfactory
a
study
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practitioners
many
of
whom
make
a
barely
marginal
living
from
their
practice
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interested
because
the
whole
idea
seems
frivolous
and
since
theyre
not
part
of
the
scientific
establishment
they
have
no
tangible
rewards
to
gain
from
scientific
acceptance
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
is
over
ten
years
old
now
and
the
clinical
psychology
establishment
is
still
saying
we
dont
have
any
way
of
knowing
that
its
effective
these
academics
themselves
have
the
resources
to
do
a
study
as
elaborate
as
anyone
could
want
of
course
but
they
say
why
should
i
prove
your
theory
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
one
making
the
claim
one
academic
in
scipsychology
said
that
it
would
be
completely
unscientific
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
since
it
hasnt
been
described
in
a
scientific
journal
its
described
in
a
number
of
books
and
ive
posted
articles
in
scipsychology
describing
it
in
as
much
detail
as
im
capable
of
actually
at
least
one
fairly
careful
academic
study
has
been
done
with
favorable
results
but
its
apparently
not
acceptable
because
its
a
doctoral
dissertation
and
not
published
in
a
refereed
journal
to
me
this
sort
of
attitude
does
not
advance
science
but
hinders
it
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
when
i
talk
about
doctrinnaire
attitudes
about
science
now
maybe
i
have
been
unfair
in
imputing
such
attitudes
to
you
russell
if
so
i
apologize
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than

competing

everybody
repeat
after

we
are
all
individuals
subject
re
barbecued
foods
and
health
risk
rsilverworldstdcom
richard
silver
writes
some
recent
postings
remind
me
that
i
had
read
about
risks
associated
with
the
barbecuing
of
foods
namely
that
carcinogens
are
generated
is
this
a
valid
concern
if
so
is
it
a
function
of
the
smoke
or
the
elevated
temperatures
is
it
a
function
of
the
cooking
elements
wood
or
charcoal
vs
lava
rocks
i
wish
to
know
more
thanks
i
recall
that
the
issue
is
that
fat
on
the
meat
liquifies
and
then
drips
down
onto
the
hot
elementswhatever
they
arethat
the
extreme
heat
then
catalyzes
something
in
the
fat
into
one
or
more
carcinogens
which
then
are
carried
back
up
onto
the
meat
in
the
smoke
the
ol
professor
subject
re
barbecued
foods
and
health
risk
this
reminds
me
of
the
last
graham
kerr
cooking
show
i
saw
today
he
smoked
meat
on
the
stovetop
in
a
big
pot
he
used
a
strange
technique
id
never
seen
before
he
took
a
big
pot
with
lid
and
placed
a
tray
in
it
made
from
aluminum
foil
the
tray
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
typical
coffeetable
ash
tray
made
by
crumpling
a
sheet
of
foil
around
the
edges
in
the
tray
he
placed
a
couple
spoonfuls
of
brown
sugar
a
similar
quantity
of
brown
rice
he
said
any
rice
will
do
the
contents
of
two
teabags
of
earl
grey
tea
and
a
few
cloves
on
top
of
this
was
placed
an
ordinary
aluminum
baskettype
steamer
with
two
chicken
breasts
in
it
the
lid
was
put
on
and
the
whole
assembly
went
on
the
stovetop
at
high
heat
for
or
minutes
later
he
removed
what
looked
like
smoked
chicken
breasts
what
surprises
and
concerns
me
are
no
wood
chips
where
does
the
smoke
flavor
come
from
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
hearing
that
carmel
color
obtained
by
caramelizing
sugar
a
common
coloring
and
flavoring
agent
had
been
found
to
be
carcinogenic
i
believe
they
injected
it
under
the
skin
of
rats
or
something
if
the
results
were
conclusive
caramel
color
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
yet
it
is
still
being
used
was
the
initial
research
result
found
to
be
incorrect
or
what
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
earl
grey
tea
being
implicated
as
carcinogenic
because
it
contains
oil
of
bergamot
an
extract
from
the
skin
of
a
type
of
citrus
fruit
does
anyone
know
whatever
happened
with
that
story
if
it
were
carcinogenic
earl
grey
tea
could
not
have
it
as
an
additive
yet
it
apparently
continues
to
do
so
wrt
natural
wood
smoke
ive
smoking
a
duck
right
now
as
it
happens
ive
noticed
that
a
heavilysmoked
food
item
will
have
an
unpleasant
tangy
taste
when
eaten
directly
out
of
the
smoker
if
the
smoke
has
only
recently
stopped
flowing
i
find
the
best
taste
to
be
had
by
using
dry
wood
chips
getting
lots
of
smoke
right
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
process
then
slowly
barbequing
for
hours
and
hours
without
adding
additional
wood
chips
my
theory
is
that
the
unpleasant
tangy
molecules
are
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
like
terpenes
and
that
the
smoky
flavor
molecules
are
some
sort
of
larger
molecule
more
similar
to
tar
the
long
barbeque
time
after
the
initial
intensive
smoke
drives
off
the
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
just
leaving
the
flavor
behind
does
anyone
know
if
my
theory
is
correct
i
also
remember
hearing
that
the
combustion
products
of
fat
dripping
on
the
charcoal
and
burning
are
carcinogenic
for
that
reason
and
because
it
covers
the
product
with
soot
and
some
unpleasant
tanginess
i
only
grill
nondrippy
meats
like
prawns
directly
over
hot
coals
i
do
stuff
like
this
duck
by
indirect
heat
i
have
a
long
rectangular
weber
and
i
put
the
coals
at
one
end
and
the
meat
at
the
other
end
the
fat
drops
directly
on
the
floor
below
the
meat
and
next
time
i
use
the
barbeque
i
make
the
fire
in
that
end
to
burn
off
the
fat
and
help
ignite
the
coals
and
yet
another
reason
ive
heard
not
to
smoke
or
barbeque
meat
is
that
smoked
cured
meat
like
pork
sausage
and
bacon
contains
nitrosamines
which
are
carcinogenic
im
pretty
sure
this
claim
actually
has
some
standing
dont
know
about
the
others
an
amusing
incident
i
recall
was
the
duncan
hines
scandal
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
people
who
make
duncan
hines
cake
mix
were
putting
a
lot
of
ethylene
dibromide
edb
into
the
cake
mix
to
suppress
weevils
this
is
a
fumigant
which
is
known
to
be
carcinogenic
the
guy
who
represented
the
company
in
the
press
conference
defended
himself
by
saying
that
the
risk
from
eating
duncan
hines
products
every
day
for
a
year
would
be
equal
to
the
cancer
risk
from
eating
two
charcoal
broiled
steaks
what
a
great
analogy
when
i
first
heard
that
my
immediate
reaction
was
we
should
make
that
a
standard
unit
one
charcoal
broiled

would

re
what
are
the
problems
with
nutrasweet
aspartame
hbloommooseuvmedu
heather
writes
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
phenylalanine
is
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
it
is
an
amino
acid
and
everyone
uses
small
quantities
of
it
for
protein
synthesis
in
the
body
some
people
have
a
disease
known
as
phenylketoneurea
and
they
are
missing
the
enzyme
necessary
to
degrade
this
compound
and
eliminate
it
from
the
body
for
them
it
will
accumulate
in
the
body
and
in
high
levels
this
is
toxic
to
growing
nerve
cells
therefore
it
is
only
a
major
problem
in
young
children
until
around
age
or
so
or
women
who
are
pregnant
and
have
this
disorder
it
used
to
be
a
leading
cause
of
brain
damage
in
infants
but
now
it
can
be
easily
detected
at
birth
and
then
one
must
simply
avoid
comsumption
of
phenylalanine
as
a
child
or
when
pregnant
heather
if
i
remember
rightly
pku
syndrome
in
infants
is
about
they
lack
two
genes
and
people
who
lack
one
gene
are
supposed
to
be
persons
those
with
pku
have
to
avoid
naturally
occuring
phenylalanine
and
those
who
only
have

gene

it

few

gordon
why
do
you
think
this
is
so
probably
because
most
of
them
come
packaged
with
some
absurd
theory
behind
them
eg
homoeopathy
like
cures
like
the
more
you

the
more

chiropractic
all
illness

such
systems
are
so
patently
absurd
that
any
good
they
do
is
accidental
and
not
related
to
the
theory
the
only
exception
is
probably
herbalism
because
scientists
recognize
the
potent
drugs
that
derive
from
plants
and
are
always
interested
in
seeing
if
they
can
find
new

that

you
are
now
back

silly
theories
that
probably
have
nothing
to
do
with
why
accupuncture

another

the

the
greatest
hazard
of
barbecuing
is
that
the
cook
will
not
use
enough
caution
and
get
burned
some
people
suggest
that
the
barbecuing
itself
is
dangerous
because
the
smoke
which
is
absorbed
by
the
meat
contains
benzopyrene
which
in
its
pure
form
has
been
known
to
cause
cancer
in
laboratory
animals
however
in
order
to
experience
the
same
results
people
would
have
to
consume
unrealistically
large
quantities
of
barbecued
meat

nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic

a

thousand
times
sweeter
than

some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the

produces
when

degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known

methanol
in
the

that
the

the
real

is
whether
the
levels
of

formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant

as
both
are

that

in

is
a

about
artificial

what
follows
are
those
excerpts
which
deal
specifically
with
nutrasweet
reproduced
without
permission
the
controversy
over
aspartame
began
six
years
ago
in
england
where
a
group
of
researchers
found
that
aspartame
marketed
under
the
tradename
nutrasweet
appears
to
stimulate
appetite
and
presumably
the
eating
of
more
calories
in
the
long
run
than
if
a
person
simply
consumed
sugar
when
researchers
asked
a
group
of
people
to
drink
plain
water
aspartamesweetened
water
and
sugared
water
they
said
that
overall
they
felt
hungriest
after
drinking
the
artificially
sweetened
beverage
the
study
received
widespread
media
attention
and
stirred
a
good
deal
of
concern
among
the
artificialsweetenerusing
public
however
its
results
were
questionable
at
best
since
the
researchers
did
not
go
on
to
measure
whether
the
increase
in
appetite
did
actually
translate
into
an
increase
in
eating
the
two
do
not
necessarily
go
hand
in
hand
in
the
years
that
followed
more
than
a
dozen
studies
examining
the
effect
of
aspartame
on
appetite
and
eating
were
conducted
and
after
reviewing
every
one
of
them
the
director
of
the
laboratory
of
the
study
of
human
ingestive
behavior
at
johns
hopkins

concluded
that
consuming
aspartame
sweetened
foods
and
drinks
is
not
associated
with
any
increase
in
the
amount
of
food
eaten
afterward
one
artificial
sweetener
that
is
not
typically
accused
of
causing
cancer
is
aspartame
but
it
most
certainly
has
been
blamed
for
a
host
of
other
ills
since
its
introduction
in
the
government
has
received
thousands
of
complaints
accusing
it
of
causing
everything
from
headaches
to
nausea
to
mood
swings
to
anxiety
still
years
of

conducted
both
before

ksmy

has
become
interested
through

in

ksthis
apparently
is
not
recognised
in

and
different
symptons
eg
kschest
complaints
are
treated
separately
does
anone
have
any
information
im
not
sure
that
this
condition
is
recognised
anywhere
in
the
sense
of
a
disease
with
diagnostic
criteria
clear
boundaries
between
it
and
other
diseases
unique
pathologic
or
physiologic
features
etc
but
here
goes
with
what
many
neurologists
agree
on
postpolio
syndrome
patients
have
evidence
of
motor
neuron
disease
by
clinical
examination
emg
and
muscle
biopsy
the
abnormalities
are
mostly
chronic
due
to
old
polio
but
there
is
evidence
of
ongoing
deterioration
clinically
the
patients
complain
of
declining
strength
and
endurance
with
everyday
motor
tasks
musculoskeletal
pain
is
a
nearly
universal
feature
that
doubtless
contributes
to
the
impaired
performance
the
examination
shows
muscle
weakness
and
atrophy
the
emg
shows
evidence
of
old
denervation
with
reinnervation
giant
and
longduration
motor
unit
action
potentials
and
evidence
of
active
denervation
fibrillation
potentials
the
biopsy
also
shows
old
denervation
with
reinnervation
fibertype
grouping
and
evidence
of
active
denervation
small
angulated
fibers
with
dense
oxidative
enzyme
staining
but
curiously
little
or
no
group
atrophy
postpolio
patients
do
not
have
als
in
als
there
is
clinically
evident
deterioration
from
one
month
to
the
next
in
postpolio
the
patients
are
remarkably
stable
in
objective
findings
from
one
year
to
the
next
of
course
there
are
patients
who
had
polio
before
who
develop
genuine
als
but
als
is
no
more
common
among
polio
survivors
than
among
people
who
never
had
polio
the
cause
of
postpolio
syndrome
is
unknown
there
is
little
evidence
that
postpolio
patients
have
active
polio
virus
or
destructive
immunologic
response
to
virus
antigen
there
is
no
solid
evidence
that
patients
with
postpolio
have
anything
different
happening
to
the
motor
unit
anterior
horn
cells
motor
axons
neuromuscular
junctions
and
muscle
fibers
than
patients
with
old
polio
who
are
not
complaining
of
deterioration
both
groups
can
have
the
same
emg
and
biopsy
findings
the
reason
for
these
acute
changes
in
a
chronic
disease
old
polio
is
unknown
possibly
spinal
motor
neurons
that
have
reinnervated
huge
numbers
of
muscle
fibers
start
shedding
the
load
after
several
years
there
are
a
couple
of
clinical
features
that
distinguish
postpolio
syndrome
patients
from
patients
with
old
polio
who
deny
deterioration
the
pps
patients
are
more
likely
to
have
had
severe
polio
the
pps
patients
are
much
more
likely
to
complain
of
pain
they
also
tend
to
score
higher
on
depression
scales
of
neuropsychologic
tests
my
take
on
this
im
sure
some
will
disagree
after
recovery
from
severe
polio
there
can
be
abnormal
loading
on
muscles
tendons
ligaments
bones
and
joints
that
leads
to
inflammatory
andor
degenerative
conditions
affecting
these
structures
the
increasing
pain
superimposed
on
the
chronic
but
unchanging
weakness
leads
to
progressive
impairment
of
motor
performance
and
adl
i
am
perhaps
biased
by
personal
experience
of
having
never
seen
a
pps
patient
who
was
not
limited
in
some
way
by
pain
i
do
not
believe
that
pps
patients
have
more
rapid
deterioration
of
motor
units
than
nonpps
patients
ie
those
with
old
polio
of
similar
severity
but
without
pps
complaints

theory

so
die
sooner
if

the

evidence

instead
the

we

we

using
genetic

we

the
ethical
question
is
should
we

have
been
reducing
the
gene
pool
and
defining
the

not

vulcanism

therefore
having

is
a
good
strategy
for

survival
of
course
the

would
start
out
as
no
different
than
anyone
elses

if
we

at

these

when

man
needs
to
accept
input
from
the
great
spirit
of
god
to
overcome
his
lacks
in
the
area
of
knowing
how
to
use
the
power
he
has
some
men
have
and
i
believe
all
men
may
listen
to
and
obey
the
still
small
voice
of
god
in
their
hearts
this
is
the
way
to
begin
to
recieve
the
wisdom
and
virtue
needed
to
escape
the
problems
consequent
to
poor
choices
peoples
have
died
out
for
many
reasons
the
societies
which
failed
to
accept
enough
input
from
god
to
safely
use
the
power
they
had
developed
have
destroyed
themselves
and
often
others
in
the
process
it
is
selfevident
that
the
ones
which
survive
today
have
either
accepted
enough
input
from
the
spirit
to
use
their
powers
wisely
enough
to
avoid
or
survive
their
own
mistakes
thus
far
or
else
havent
had
enough
power
for
long
enough
in
summary
i
would
say
that
the
question
of
whether
to
use
this
new
technology
is
really
an
ancient
one
and
the
answer
in
some
ways
hard
in
some
ways
easy
is
the
same
ancient
answer
it
isnt
the
power
it
is
the
spirit

it

and
which
are
not

with

or

is

so
theres
a
question
of
how
much
certainty
we
are
willing
to
pay
for
in
a
given
context
insistence
on
too
much
rigor
bogs
science
down
completely
and
makes
progress
impossible
expenditure
of
sufficiently
large
sums
of
money
and
amounts
of
time
can
sometimes
overcome
this
on
the
other
hand
with
too
little
rigor
much
is
lost
by
basing
work
on
results
which
eventually
turn
out
to
be
false
there
is
a
morass
of
studies
contradicting
other
studies
and
outsiders
start
saying
you
people
call
this
science
my
opinion
for
what
its
worth
is
that
one
sees
both
these
phenomena
happening
simultaneously
in
some
parts
of
psychology
some
subjective
judgement
is
required
to
decide
on
the
level
of
rigor
appropriate
for
a
particular
investigation
i
dont
believe
it
is
ever
possible
to
banish
subjective
judgement
from
science
my
second
point
though
is
that
highly
capable
people
can
often
make
extremely
reliable
judgements
about
scientific
validity
even
when
using
methodology
considered
inadequate
by
the
usual
standards
i
think
this
is
true
of
many
scientists
and
i
think
it
is
true
of
many
who
approach
their
discipline
in
a
way
that
is
not
generally
recognized
as
scientific
within
mathematics
i
think
there
are
several
examples
especially
before
the
twentieth
century
one
conspicuous
case
is
that
of
riemann
who
is
famous
for
many
theorems
he
stated
but
did
not
prove
later
mathematicians
did
prove
them
of
course
i
think
that
for
a
good
scientist
empirical
investigation
is
often
not
so
much
a
matter
of
determining
what
is
true
and
whats
not
as
it
is
a
matter
of
convincing
other
people
people
have
proposed
lots
of
incompatible
definitions
of
science
here
but
i
think
the
ability
to
objectively
convince
others
of
the
validity
of
ones
results
is
an
essential
element
not
that
one
can
necessarily
do
that
at
every
step
of
the
scientific
process
but
i
think
that
if
one
is
not
moving
toward
that
goal
then
one
is
not
doing
science
when
a
person
other
than
a
scientist
is
quite
good
at
what
he
does
and
seems
to
be
very
successful
at
it
i
think
that
his
judgements
are
also
worthy
of
respect
and
that
his
assertions
are
well
worth
further
investigation
in
article
i
wrote
namely
is
there
really
justification
for
the
belief
that
science
is
a
superior
path
to
truth
than
nonscientific
approaches
admittedly
my
question
was
not
at
all
well
posed
a
considerable
amount
of
effort
in
a
serious
scholarly
investigation
such
as
i
suggested
would
be
required
simply
to
formulate
an
appropriately
specific
question
to
try
and
answer
the
science
i
was
thinking
of
in
my
question
is
the
actual
science
currently
practiced
now
in
the
last
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
i
certainly
wasnt
thinking
of
some
idealized
science
or
the
mere
use
of
reason
and
observation
one
thing
i
had
in
mind
in
my
suggestion
was
the
question
as
to
whether
in
many
cases
the
subjective
judgements
of
skilled
and
experienced
practitioners
might
be
more
reliable
than
statistical
studies
since
russell
turpin
seems
to
be
much
more
familiar
than
i
am
with
the
study
of
scientific
methodology
perhaps
he
can
tell
us
if
there
is
any
existing
research
related
to
this
question
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

critique

massager
as
promised
below
is
a
personal
critique
of
a
pressure
point
massager
i
recently
bought
from
the
self
care
catalog
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
results
the
catalog
description
is
as
follows
the
pressure
point
massager
is
an
aggressive
physical
massager
that
actually
kneads
the
tension
out
of
muscles
much
like
a
professional
shiatsu
masseur
the
powerful
motor
drives
two
counterrotating
thumbs
that
move
in
oneinch
orbits
releasing
tension
in
the
neck
back
legs
and
arms
pressure
point
massager
to
order
or
receive
a
catalog
call
hours
days
or
fax
at
note
when
i
ordered
the
massager
the
item
number
was
different
and
the
price
was
not
when
i
received
it
i
glanced
thru
the
newer
catalog
enclosed
with
it
to
see
anything
was
different
from
the
first
one
i
was
quite
annoyed
to
see
a
difference
in
price
i
called
them
about
it
and
the
cust
rep
said
that
they
had
switched
manufacturers
although
it
looks
and
works
exactly
the
same
he
told
me
to
go
ahead
and
return
the
first
one
and
order
the
cheaper
one
using
the
price
difference
as
a
reason
for
return
in
fact
since
the
newer
ones
might
take
a
while
to
ship
from
the
factory
i
received
this
one
in
days
he
told
me
i
could
use
the
one
i
already
have
until
the
new
one
arrives
then
return
the
old
one
very
reasonable
people
i
have
longterm
neck
shoulder
and
back
pain
if
i
were
a
building
i
would
be
described
as
structurally
unsound
i
have
stretches
and
exercises
to
do
that
help
but
the
problem
never
really
goes
away
if
for
whatever
reason
i
do
not
exercise
for
a
while
illness
not
enough
time
lazy
etc
the
muscles
become
quite
stiff
and
painful
and
thus
more
prone
to
further
strain
even
with
exercise
i
sometimes
require
physical
therapy
to
get
back
on
track
which
requires
a
doctor
visit
to
get
the
prescription
for
pt
the
tension
in
my
neck
if
not
released
eventually
causes
a
headache
sometimes
confused
with
a
sinus
headache
over
my
left
eye
when
my
physical
therapist
has
massaged
my
neck
and
the
suboccipital
muscles
in
particular
the
knobby
areas
near
the
base
of
the
skull
the
headache
usually
eased
within
a
day
although
it
hurts
like
hell
to
while
it
is
being
massaged
i
ordered
this
device
because
it
seemed
to
be
exactly
what
i
was
wishing
someone
would
invent
a
machine
that
would
massage
not
vibrate
my
neck
and
suboccipital
muscles
like
my
physical
therapist
has
done
in
the
past
that
i
could
use
by
myself
no
doctor
visit
or
inconvenient
pt
appts
for
a
week
later
would
be
needed
to
use
it
i
could
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
use
it
if
necessary
i
have
been
using
it
for
about
a
week
or
so
now
and
love
it
the
base
unit
is
about
a
x
rectangle
about
high
with
handles
on
each
side
and
it
plugs
into
an
average
outlet
the
two
metal
thumbs
are
about
in
diameter
and
protrude
about
above
the
base
the
thumbs
are
covered
with
a
gray
cloth
that
is
nonremovable
they
are
located
more
toward
one
end
rather
than
centered
see
figure
below
they
move
in
either
clockwise
or
counterclockwise
directions
depending
on
which
side
of
the
switch
is
pushed
and
are
very
quiet
it
can
be
used
from
either
side
for
instance
the
thumbs
can
be
positioned
at
the
base
of
the
neck
or
the
top
of
the
neck
depending
on
which
direction
you
approach
it
for
the
neckhead
the
user
varies
the
amount
of
pressure
used
by
if
laying
down
allowing
all
or
part
of
the
full
weight
of
the
head
andor
neck
to
rest
on
the
thumbs
the
handles
can
also
be
used
if
sitting
or
standing
applying
pressure
with
the
armswrists
since
my
wrists
are
also
impaired
im
typing
this
over
an
extended
period
of
time
and
i
dont
have
someone
living
with
me
who
can
apply
it
laying
down
works
well
for
me
for
my
back
i
sit
in
a
highbacked
kitchen
chair
position
the
massager
behind
me
at
whatever
point
i
want
massaged
and
lean
back
lightly
or
not
so
lightly
against
it
the
pressure
of
leaning
back
holds
it
in
place
if
i
want
to
massage
the
entire
spine
i
simply
move
it
down
a
few
inches
whenever
i
feel
like
it
for
my
back
this
machine
is
far
superior
to
use
than
the
commonly
used
homemade
massager
of
tennis
balls
taped
together
with
the
balls
position
against
a
wall
or
door
them
over
the
spine
and
move
the
body
up
and
down
against
them
the
tennis
balls
are
better
than
nothing
but
difficult
to
use
for
very
long
especially
if
your
quads
are
not
in
good
shape
and
my
long
hair
gets
painfully
in
the
way
if
i
dont
pin
it
up
first
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
easier
something
like
this
is
to
use
the
more
likely
ill
usedo
it
if
there
are
multiple
considerationshassles
im
more
likely
to
not
bother
with
it
not
only
has
this
machine
helped
with
my
headaches
but
my
range
of
motion
for
my
neck
and
back
are
greatly
increased
the
first
time
i
used
it
on
my
necksuboccipital
muscles
however
i
overdid
it
and
pressed
too
hard
against
it
which
resulted
in
a
very
tender
almost
bruised
area
for
a
few
days
i
laid
off
it
for
about
days
and
applied
ice
which
helped
after
that
i
was
more
gradual
about
applying
pressure
at
this
point
the
pain
in
the
suboccipital
area
is
now
minimal
while
being
massaged
i
also
learned
to
use
very
light
pressure
on
my
lower
back
which
is
the
most
vulnerable
point
for
me
it
also
eased
some
painful
knots
of
tension
between
my
shoulder
blades
although
again
it
took
a
few
days
of
massaging
just
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
to
really
work
it
out
i
highly
recommend
this
product
if
you
have
similar
problems
although
i
cannot
vouch
for
its
durability
it
seems
pretty
sturdy
since
ive
had
it
such
a
short
time
i
plan
to
use
it
not
only
to
ease
tension
but
also
to
loosen
the
muscls
before
exercising
and
maybe
after
too
i
have
been
ill
recently
and
not
able
to
exercise
much
for
a
few
weeks
so
this
was
very
timely
for
me
this
is
the
product
ive
ordered
from
this
company
and
only
recently
became
aware
of
it
thru
a
coworker
the
catalog
states
they
have
been
in
business
since
it
contains
quite
a
few
health
care
products
and
while
they
appear
to
be
more
expensive
than
the
average
health
care
catalog
products
they
also
appear
to
be
of
much
higher
quality
with
more
thought
put
into
what
they
actually
do
definitely
a
step
above
some
other
ones
ive
seen
such

placebo
effects
i
know
that
the
placebo
effect
is
where
a
patient
feels
better
or
even
gets
better
because
of
hisher
belief
in
the
medicine
and
the
doctor
administering
it
is
there
also
an
antiplacebo
effect
where
the
patient
dislikesdistrusts
doctors
and
medicine
and
therefore
doesnt
get
better
or
feel
better
in
spite
of
the
medicine
is
there
an
effect
where
the
doctor
believes
so
strongly
in
a
medicine
that
heshe
sees
improvement
where
the
is
none
or
sees
more
improvement
than
there
is
if
so
what
is
this
effect
called
is
there
a
reverse
of
the
above
effect
where
the
doctor
doesnt
believe
in
a
medicine
and
then
sees
less
improvement
than
there
is
what
would
this

be

have

immunotherapy

my

was

the
theory
as
i

that

would
a

the

evicts

the

apparently
enhance

not
the

but
the
thoughts
in
his

as
he
considered
the
problem
it
may
be
this
smacks
a
bit
of
ideology
the
supposition
being
that
toricellis
subsequent
descriptions
of
his
reasoning
are
not
veridical
it
gets
dangerously
close
to
an
unfalsifiable
view
of
the
history
and
methodology
of
science
if
we
deny
that
no
subsequent

are
reliable
descriptions

impossible
to
know
much
about
toricellis
thoughts
thats
too
bad
if
it
is
so
one
of
rootbernsteins
services
to
science
is
that
he
has
gone
rooting
about
in
pasteurs
and
flemings
and
other
peoples
notes
and
has
discovered
some
surprising
clues
about
their
motivations
pasteur
never
publicly
admitted
his
plan
to
create
mirrorimage
life
but
the
dreams
are
right
there
in
his
notebooks
finally
public
after
many
years
ready
for
anyone
to
read
and
i
and
my
friends
often
have
the
most
ridiculous
reasons
for
pursuing
results
one
of
my
best
came
because
i
was
mad
at
a
colleague
for
a
poorlywritten
claim
i
disproved
the
claim
of
course
toricellis
case
may
be
an
example
of
a
rarety
where
the
fantasy
not
only
motivates
the
experiment
but
turns
out
to
be
right
in
the
end
but
my
point
is
that
this
type
of
case
is
not
a
rarity
in
fact
i
was
going
to
point
to
pasteur
as
yet
another
rather
common
example
particularly
the
studies
on
spontaneous
generation
and
fermentation
i
will
readily
concede
that
ridiculous
reasons
can
play
an
important
role
in
how
scientists
spend
their
time
but
one
should
not
confuse
motivation
with
methodology
nor
suppose
that
ridiculous
reasons
provide
the
impetus
in
the

whats
the

and

my
wife
and
i
are
in
the
process
of
selecting
a
pediatrician
for
our
first
child
due
june
we
interviewed
a
young
doctor
last
week
and
were
very
impressed
with
her
however
i
discovered
that
she
is
actually
not
an
medical
doctor
md
but
rather
a
doctor
of
osteopathy
do
whats
the
difference
i
believe
the
pediatrician
i
went
to
for
many
years
was
a
do
and
he
didnt
seem
different
from
any
other
doctor
ive
seen
over
the
years
my
dictionary
says
that
osteopathy
is
a
medical
therapy
that
emphasizes
manipulative
techniques
for
correcting
somatic
abnormalities
thought
to
cause
disease
and
inhibit
recovery
jeez
this
sounds
like
chiropractic
i
remember
getting
shots
and
medicine
from
my
pediatrician
do
and
dont
remember
any
manipulative
techniques
perhaps
someone
could
enlighten
me
as
to
the
real
practical
difference
between
an
md
and
a
do
also
im
interesting
in
hearing
any
opinions

choosing

follows

medical

this
reminds
me
of
the
last
graham
kerr
cooking
show
i
saw
today
he
smoked
meat
on
the
stovetop
in
a
big
pot
he
used
a
strange
technique
id
never
seen
before
he
took
a
big
pot
with
lid
and
placed
a
tray
in
it
made
from
aluminum
foil
the
tray
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
typical
coffeetable
ash
tray
made
by
crumpling
a
sheet
of
foil
around
the
edges
in
the
tray
he
placed
a
couple
spoonfuls
of
brown
sugar
a
similar
quantity
of
brown
rice
he
said
any
rice
will
do
the
contents
of
two
teabags
of
earl
grey
tea
and
a
few
cloves
on
top
of
this
was
placed
an
ordinary
aluminum
baskettype
steamer
with
two
chicken
breasts
in
it
the
lid
was
put
on
and
the
whole
assembly
went
on
the
stovetop
at
high
heat
for
or
minutes
later
he
removed
what
looked
like
smoked
chicken
breasts
what
surprises
and
concerns
me
are
no
wood
chips
where
does
the
smoke
flavor
come
from
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
hearing
that
carmel
color
obtained
by
caramelizing
sugar
a
common
coloring
and
flavoring
agent
had
been
found
to
be
carcinogenic
i
believe
they
injected
it
under
the
skin
of
rats
or
something
if
the
results
were
conclusive
caramel
color
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
yet
it
is
still
being
used
was
the
initial
research
result
found
to
be
incorrect
or
what
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
earl
grey
tea
being
implicated
as
carcinogenic
because
it
contains
oil
of
bergamot
an
extract
from
the
skin
of
a
type
of
citrus
fruit
does
anyone
know
whatever
happened
with
that
story
if
it
were
carcinogenic
earl
grey
tea
could
not
have
it
as
an
additive
yet
it
apparently
continues
to
do
so
wrt
natural
wood
smoke
ive
smoking
a
duck
right
now
as
it
happens
ive
noticed
that
a
heavilysmoked
food
item
will
have
an
unpleasant
tangy
taste
when
eaten
directly
out
of
the
smoker
if
the
smoke
has
only
recently
stopped
flowing
i
find
the
best
taste
to
be
had
by
using
dry
wood
chips
getting
lots
of
smoke
right
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
process
then
slowly
barbequing
for
hours
and
hours
without
adding
additional
wood
chips
my
theory
is
that
the
unpleasant
tangy
molecules
are
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
like
terpenes
and
that
the
smoky
flavor
molecules
are
some
sort
of
larger
molecule
more
similar
to
tar
the
long
barbeque
time
after
the
initial
intensive
smoke
drives
off
the
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
just
leaving
the
flavor
behind
does
anyone
know
if
my
theory
is
correct
i
also
remember
hearing
that
the
combustion
products
of
fat
dripping
on
the
charcoal
and
burning
are
carcinogenic
for
that
reason
and
because
it
covers
the
product
with
soot
and
some
unpleasant
tanginess
i
only
grill
nondrippy
meats
like
prawns
directly
over
hot
coals
i
do
stuff
like
this
duck
by
indirect
heat
i
have
a
long
rectangular
weber
and
i
put
the
coals
at
one
end
and
the
meat
at
the
other
end
the
fat
drops
directly
on
the
floor
below
the
meat
and
next
time
i
use
the
barbeque
i
make
the
fire
in
that
end
to
burn
off
the
fat
and
help
ignite
the
coals
and
yet
another
reason
ive
heard
not
to
smoke
or
barbeque
meat
is
that
smoked
cured
meat
like
pork
sausage
and
bacon
contains
nitrosamines
which
are
carcinogenic
im
pretty
sure
this
claim
actually
has
some
standing
dont
know
about
the
others
an
amusing
incident
i
recall
was
the
duncan
hines
scandal
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
people
who
make
duncan
hines
cake
mix
were
putting
a
lot
of
ethylene
dibromide
edb
into
the
cake
mix
to
suppress
weevils
this
is
a
fumigant
which
is
known
to
be
carcinogenic
the
guy
who
represented
the
company
in
the
press
conference
defended
himself
by
saying
that
the
risk
from
eating
duncan
hines
products
every
day
for
a
year
would
be
equal
to
the
cancer
risk
from
eating
two
charcoal
broiled
steaks
what
a
great
analogy
when
i
first
heard
that
my
immediate
reaction
was
we
should
make
that
a
standard
unit
one
charcoal
broiled
steak
would
be
equivalent
to
duncans
i
dont
understand
the
assumption
that
because
something
is
found
to
be
carcinogenic
that
it
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
i
think
that
naturally
occuring
substances
excluding
controlled
substances
are
pretty
much
unregulated
in
terms
of
their
use
as
food
food
additives
or
other
consumption
its
only
when
the
chemists
concoct
sp
an
ingredient
that
it
falls
under
fda
regulations
otherwise
if
they
really
looked
closely
they
would
find
a
reason
to
ban
almost
everything
how
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
its
legal
to
consume
tobacco
products
which
probably
should
be
banned

is
there
an
effect
where
the
doctor
believes
so
strongly
in
a
medicine
that
heshe
sees
improvement
where
the
is
none
or
sees
more
improvement
than
there
is
if
so
what
is
this
effect
called
is
there
a
reverse
of
the
above
effect
where
the
doctor
doesnt
believe
in
a
medicine
and
then
sees
less
improvement
than
there
is
what
would
this
effect
be
called
have
these
effects
ever
been
studied
how
common
are
these
effects
thank
you
in
advance
for
all
replies
these
effects
are
a
very
real
concern
in
conducting
studies
of
new
treatments
researchers
try
to
limit
this
kind
of
effect
by
performing
studies
that
are
blind
in
various
ways
some
of
these
are
o
the
subjects
of
the
study
do
not
know
whether
they
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
ie
whether
they
are
in
the
control
group
or
the
test
group
o
those
administering
the
treatment
do
not
know
which
subjects
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
o
those
evaluating
individual
results
do
not
know
which
subjects
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
obviously
at
the
point
at
which
the
data
is
analyzed
one
has
to
differentiate
the
test
group
from
the
control
group
but
the
analysis
is
quasipublic
the
researcher
describes
it
and
presents
the
data
on
which
it
is
based
so
that
others
can
verify
it
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
biological
studies
where
the
subjects
are
animals
such
as
mice
there
were
many
cases
of
skewed
results
because
those
who
performed
the
study
did
not
blind
themselves
it
is
not
considered
so
important
to
make
mice
more
ignorant
than
they
already
are
though
it
is
important
that
in
all
respects
except
the
one
tested
the
control
and
test
groups
are
treated
alike

i
remember
hearing
a
few
years
back
about
a
new
therapy
for
hyperactivity
which
involved
aggressively
eliminating
artificial
coloring
and
flavoring
from
the
diet
the
theory
which
was
backed
up
by
interesting
anecdotal
results
is
that
certain
people
are
just
way
more
sensitive
to
these
chemicals
than
other
people
i
dont
remember
any
connection
being
made
with
seizures
but
it
certainly
couldnt
hurt
to
try
an
allnatural
diet
yeah
the
feingold
diet
is
a
load
of
crap
children
diagnosed

who
are
placed

show
no

in

continue

the

enthusiastic

lap
it
up

thanks
for
all
the
interest
in
this
problem
of
mine
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reaction
to
sugar
or
junk
food
per
se
since
kathryn
has
never
shown
any
signs
of
hyperactivity
or
changes
in
behavior
in
response
to
food
she
has
always
been
very
calm
and
dare
i
say
a
neat
smart
kid
the
fact
that
this
happened
while
eating
two
sugar
coated
cereals
made
by
kellogs
makes
me
think
she
might
be
having
an
allergic
reaction
to
something
in
the
coating
or
the
cereals
of
the
four
of
us
in
our
immediate
family
kathryn
shows
the
least
signs
of
the
hay
fever
running
nose
itchy
eyes
etc
but
we
have
a
lot
of
allergies
in
our
family
history
including
some
weird
food
allergies
nuts
mushrooms
anyway
our
next
trip
is
to
an
endocrinologist
to
check
out
the
body
chemistry
but
so
far
no
more
sugar
coated
cereals
and
no
more
seizures
either
every
day
that
goes
by
without
one
makes
me
heave
a
sigh
of
relief

a

in

the

was
repaired
using

method
and
a

and

the

considered
the
procedure
a
success
a

returned

said

now

is
not
an
invertebrate
but
it
hardly
tells
you
what
invertebrates
are
all
about
one
can
read
this
definition
and
still
not
know
that
of
all
animal
species
are
invertebrates
that
invertebrates
possess
a
remarkably
broad
range
of
form
that
some
invertebrate
groups
such
as
insects
and
nematodes
are
ubiquitous
in
all
ecosystems
etc
in
short
knowing
the
definition
of
invertebrates
does
not
tell
one
what
they
are
mainly
about
the
misunderstanding
here
is
my
fault
i
did
not
give
sufficient
context
for
people
to
understand
my
proposed
definition
okay
so
lets
see
if
we
agree
on
this
first
of
all
there
are
degrees
of
certainty
it
might
be
appropriate
for
instance
to
demand
carefully
controlled
trials
before
we
accept
as
absolute
scientific
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highly
favorable
clinical
experience
even
if
uncontrolled
can
be
adequate
to
justify
a
preliminary
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
useful
secondly
it
makes
sense
to
be
more
tolerant
in
our
standards
of
evidence
for
a
pronounced
effect
than
for
one
that
is
marginal
i
agree
on
both
counts
as
an
example
of
the
second
it
would
only
take
a
few
cases
of
curing
rabies
to
convince
most
veterinarians
that
a
treatment
was
effective
despite
a
lack
of
controls
as
to
the
first
i
do
not
think
it
is
useful
to
talk
about
absolute
scientific
truth
i
think
it
is
more
useful
to
talk
about
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
various
claims
have
and
the
kinds
of
evidence
in
particular
fields
that
in
the
past
have
proven
faulty
or
reliable
the
latter
is
obviously
a
matter
of
degree
and
in
each
field
practitioners
try
to
discover
the
relevance
of
different
kinds
of
evidence
one
of
the
primary
mistakes
that
marks
the
advocacy
of
an
idea
as
psuedoscience
is
that
the
advocacy
lacks
any
sense
of
proportion
regarding
the
kinds
of
evidence
related
to
the
proposed
claim
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
actually
relevant
to
it
and
the
historical
reasons
in
the
field
that
certain
kinds
of
evidence
are
given
more
weight
than
others
it
is
perfectly
alright
to
speculate
i
have
read
quite
a
few
refereed
papers
that
speculated
left
and
right
but
the
authors
were
careful
to
identify
the
notions
as
speculative
to
list
what
little
evidence
was
presently
available
for
them
and
to
describe
how
research
could
proceed
to
either
put
the
notion
on
more
firm
footing
or
to
uncover
its
problems
often
what
distinguishes
whether
a
paper
of
this
sort
passes
muster
is
the
thoughtfulness
with
which
the
author
sets
the
context
and
paves
the
way
for
future
work
it
is
in
this
area
that
many
proponents
of
speculative
ideas
fail
the
folks
over
in
scipsychology
have
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
not
to
make
this
simple
test
they
claim
that
only
an
elaborate
outcome
study
will
be
satisfactory
a
study
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practitioners
many
of
whom
make
a
barely
marginal
living
from
their
practice
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interested
because
the
whole
idea
seems
frivolous
and
since
theyre
not
part
of
the
scientific
establishment
they
have
no
tangible
rewards
to
gain
from
scientific
acceptance
i
think
a
lot
of
scientists
steer
away
from
things
that
deserving
or
not
garner
a
patina
of
kookiness
when
proponents
of
some
practice
see
no
value
in
more
careful
investigation
of
that
practice
that
sets
alarms
ringing
in
many
researchers
minds
this
is
unfortunate
because
there
is
undoubtedly
some
intersection
between
things
that
are
worth
investigating
and
things
that
are
advocated
by
those
who
seem
careless
or
unreasonable
in
their
advocacy
on
the
other
hand
i
can
understand
why
many
scientists
would
just
as
soon
select
other
directions
for
research
as
gordon
banks
has
pointed
out
no
one
wants
to
become
this
generations
rhine
one
academic
in
scipsychology
said
that
it
would
be
completely
unscientific
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
since
it
hasnt
been
described
in
a
scientific
journal
i
think
this
is
absurd
actually
at
least
one
fairly
careful
academic
study
has
been
done
with
favorable
results
but
its
apparently
not
acceptable
because
its
a
doctoral
dissertation
and
not
published
in
a
refereed
journal
i
wonder
why
the
results
were
not
published
in
my
field
dissertation
results
are
typically
summarized
in
papers
that
are
submitted
to
journals
often
the
papers
are
accepted
for
publication
before
the
dissertation
is
finished
this
certainly
eases
ones
defense
finally
i
hope
lee

forgive
me
from
commenting
either
on

relate

you

actually
they
have

just

goodness
im
not

that

its
just
that
this

is
a

and
given
that

can
prove
anything
you

here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as
received
wisdom
who
said
anything
about
received
wisdom
there
is
no
question
that
orally
administered
doses
of
msg
are
capable
of
destroying
nearly
all
neurons
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
and
the
median
eminence
these
areas
are
responsible
for
the
production
of
hormones
critical
to
normal
neuroendocrine
function
and
the
normal
development
of
the
vertabrate
organism
humans
are
vertebrates
now
what
pray
tell
do
you
think
will
happen
when
the
area
of
the
brain
necessary
for
the
normal
rhythm
of
gonadotropin
release
is
missing
are
you
trying
to
say
that
humans
have
no
need
of
their
pituitary
anh
and
me
of
that
part
of
the
brain
that
is
responsible
for
controlling
the
realease
albeit
indirectly
of
estradiol
and
testosterone
how
do
you
expect
anyone
to
do
the
studies
on
this
its
unethical
to
sacrifice
humans
to
check
out
what
effects
chronic
acute
etc
doses
of
these
compounds
are
having
on
the
brain
tissue
in
humans
the
food
industry
knows
this
thats
why
the
animal
model
is
used
in
medicine
and
psych
if
youre
talking
about
straight
sensitivity
it
would
be
useful
to
define
the
term
there
are
plenty
of
studies
on
psychoneuroimmunology
showing
the
link
between
attitude
and
physiology
i
suspect
we
may
be
arguing
about
separate
things
only
adult
sensitivities
you
and
lateoccuring
sequelae
of
childhood
ingestion
and
its
implication
for
adults
me
certainly
the
doses
for
excitotoxicity
in
adults
are
considerably
larger
than
for
the
young
but
the
additivity
of
glu
and
asp
and
their
copious
and
increased
presence
in
modern
processed
foods
jointly
and
their
hidden
presence
in
hvp
necessitates
extreme
caution
why
would
anyone
want
to
eat
compounds
which
have
been
shown
to
markedly
perturb
the

system
in

the
main
point
is
blood
levels
attained

would

have
to
be
greater

over
what
i
would
be

interested

seeing
you
provide

a
putative
causal
mechanism
for

sensitivities
terry
epelbaum
and
martin
have
shown
that
orally
administered
msg
causes
changes
in
normal
gonadotropic
hormone
fluctutations
in
adults
glu
also
was
found
to
induce
immediate
and
persistant
supression
of
rhythmic
gh
secretion
and
to
induce
rapid
and
transient
release
of
prolactin
in
adults
chronically
exposed
to

gh
is
responsible
not
only
for
control
of

also
converts

are
pretty
much
unregulated
in

their

food

its
only
when
the
chemists
concoct
sp
an

that
it
falls
under
fda
regulations
otherwise
if
they
really
looked
closely
they
would
find
a
reason
to
ban
almost
everything
how
in
the

do
you
suppose
its
legal
to
consume
tobacco
products
which
probably
should
be
banned
no
there
is
something
called
the
delany
amendment
which
makes
carcinogenic
food
additives
illegal
in
any
amount
this
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
before
stuff
like
mass
spectrometry
became
available
which
increased
detectable
levels
of
substances
by
a
couple
orders
of
magnitude
this
is
why
things
like
cyclamates
and
red
were
banned
they
are
very
weakly
carcinogenic
in
huge
quantities
in
rats
so
under
the
act
they
are
banned
this
also
applies
to
natural
carcinogens

this
is

if

were
possible
to
market
a
root
beer
good
like
the
old
days
someone
would
do
it
in
order
to
make
money
the
fact
that
no
one
does
it
indicates
that
enforcement
is
still
in
effect
an
odd
exception
to
the
rule
seems
to
be
the

this

nothing

this

have

have
been
produced
in

and

using
kirlian
photography
it
is
possible
to
show
an
aura
around
peoples
fingers
notably
around
those
of
healers
who
are
concentrating
on
healing
someone
normally
blue
and
white
rays
emanate
from
the
fingers
but
when
a
subject
becomes
angry
or
excited
the
aura
turns
red
and
spotty
the
soviets
are
now
using
kirlian
photography
to
diagnose
diseases
which
cannot
be
diagnosed
by
any
other
method
they
argue
that
in
most
illnesses
there
is
a
preclinical
stage
during
which
the
person
isnt
actually
ill
but
is
about
to
be
they
claim
to
be
able
to
foretell
a
disease
by
photographing
its
preclinical
phase
but
the
most
exciting
phenomenon
illustrated
by
kirlian
photography
is
the
phantom
effect
during
high
frequency
photography
of
a
leaf
from
which
a
part
had
been
cut
the
photograph
gave
a
complete
picture
of
the
leaf
with
the
removed
part
showing
up
faintly
this
is
extremely
important
because
it
backs
up
the
experiences
of
psychics
who
can
see
the
legs
of
amputees
as
if
they
were
still
there
the
important
thing
about
the
kirlian
phantoms
though
is
that
the
electromagnetic
pattern
cant
possibly
represent
a
secondary
phenomenon
or
the
field
would
vanish
when
the
piece
of
leaf
or
leg
vanished
the
energy
grid
contained
in
a
living
object
must
therefore
be
far
more
significant
than
the
actual
object
itself
kirlian
photography
has
shown
how
water
mentally
charged
by
a
healer
has
a
much
richer
energy
field
around
it

re
hernia
in
article
sheffnerencorecom
steve
heffner
writes
a
bit
more
than
a
year
ago
a
hernia
in
my
right
groin
was
discovered
it
had
produced
a
dull
pain
in
that
area
the
hernia
was
repaired
using
the
least
intrusive
orthoscopic
method
and
a
plug
and
patch
i
suspect
you
mean
laparoscopic
instead
of
orthoscopic
now
the
pain
occurs
more
often
my
gp
couldnt
identify
any
specific
problem
the
surgen
who
performed
the
original
procedure
now
says
that
yes
there
is
a
new
hernia
in
the
same
area
and
he
said
that
he
has
to
cut
into
the
area
for
the
repair
this
time
my
question
to
the
net
is
there
a
nonintrusive
method
to
determine
if
in
fact
there
is
a
hernia
or
if
the
pain
is
from
something
else
by
far
the
still
best
method
to
diagnose
a
hernia
is
old
fashioned
physical
examination
if
you
have
an
obvious
hernia
sac
coming
down
into
your
scrotum
or
a
bulge
in
your
groin
that
is
brought
about
by
increasing
intraabdominal
pressure
sometimes
is
not
that
obvious
the
hernia
is
small
and
you
can
only
detect
it
by
putting
your
finger
into
the
inguinal
canal
whether
you
have
a
recurrent
hernia
or
this
is
related
to
the
previous
operation
i
cant
tell
you
the
person
that
examined
you
is
in
the
best
position
to
make
that
determination
are
there
noninvasive
ways
of
diagnosing
a
hernia
every
now
and
then
folks
write
about
ct
scans
and
ultrasounds
for
this
but
these
are
far
too
expensive
and

re
lasers
for
dermatologists
it
is
not
true
that
dermatologists
gave
not
reached
the
laser
age
in
fact
lasers
in
dermatological
surgery
is
a
very
new
and
exciting
field
it
probably
wont
be
effective
in
tinea
pedis
because
the
laser
is
usually
a
superficial
burn
to
avoid
any
deeper
damage
limited
tinea
pedis
can
be
cured
albeit
sometimes
slowly
by
topical
antifungals
as
well
as
systemic
medication
ie
tablets
finally
a
selfdiagnosis
is
not
always
reliable
lichen
simplex
chronicus
can
look
like
a
fungal
infection
and
requires
very
different
treatment

is
there
a
righteye
dominance
eyedness
as
there
is
an
overall
righthandedness
in
the
population
i
mean
do
most
people
require
less
lens
corrections
for
the
one
eye
than
the
other
if
so
what
kinds
of
percentages
can
be
attached
to
this
there
is
eye
dominance
same
as
handedness
and
usually
for
the
same
side
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
refractive
error
however
i
recall
readingseeing
that
former
baseball
star
chris
chambliss
hitting
abilities
were
in
part
attributed
to
a
combination
of
lefthandedness
righteye
dominance
i
was
part
of
a
study
a
few
years
ago
at
the
university
of
arizona
to
see
whether
cross
dominant
individuals
those
with
a
particular
handedness
but
who
had
dominance
in
the
opposite
eye
were
better
hitters
than
those
with
same
side
dominance
of
hand
and
eye
i
was
picked
from
my
softball
class
because
i
was
cross
dominant
right
hand
left
eye
which
put
me
in
a
small
minority
and
the
grad
student
was
trying
to
get
an
equal
number
of
cross
dominant
and
same
side
dominant
people
to
control
the
study
she
used
a
pitching
machine
fast
pitch
since
i
was
used
to
slow
pitch
i
didnt
come
close
actually
i
think
i
foul
tipped
a
few
to
hitting
the
ball
if
there
were
a
lot
of
people
like
me
in
her
study
ie
those
who
cant
hit
fast
pitch
or
are
not
used
to
hitting
off
a
machine
i
would
seriously
question
the
results
of
that
study
i
think
there
have
been
some
studies
of
major
league
players
across
a
fairly
large
cross
section
of
players
to
test
whether
eye
dominance
being
the
same
or
opposite
side
was
better
but
i
dont
know
the
results
the
woman
who
ran
the
study
i
was
in
said
that
there
was
a
higher
incidence
of
crossdominance
in
major
leaguers
than
across
the
general
population
but
im
not
sure
whether
id
believe

my
family
doctor
and
the
physiotherapist
pt
she
sent
me
to
agree
that
the
pain
in
my
left
shoulder
is
bursitis
i
have
an
appointment
with
an
orthpod
i
love
that
its
short
for
orthopedic
surgeon
apparently
but
while
im
waiting
the
pt
is
treating
me
shes
using
hot
packs
ultrasound
and
lasers
but
theres
no
improvement
yet
in
fact
i
almost
suspect
its
getting
worse
my
real
question
is
about
the
laser
treatment
i
cant
easily
imagine
what
the
physical
effect
that
could
have
on
a
deep
tissue
problem
can
anyone
shed
some
light
so
to
speak
on
the
matter
if
it
works
its
only

in

satiric
sense
in
case
you
dont

krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
crullerian
photography
involves
putting
donuts
between
greasecovered
hot
metal
plates
while
illuminating
them
with
a
krypton
stroboscope
through
a
unique
iteration
involving
the
projection
of
a
torus
through
the
semistochastic
interactions
of
hot
monomolecular
lipid
layers
covering
the
metal
plates
the
best
metal
is
iron
since
it
repels
vampires
and
succubi
the
donuts
start
developing
flutes
and
within
moments
actually
become
polycrenellated
hot
greasy
breadtubes
some

at

being
highly

can
anyone
out

any

about

candida

in

who
are

this

not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by

medicine
there
is
a

talks
about

there
is
no

a

obesssive

not

disorder
is
an
acute
anxiety
disorder
characterized
by
either
obsessions
persistent
intrusive
thoughts
that
cause
anxiety
when
not
entertained
or
compulsions
repetitive
ritualistic
actions
that
similarly
cause
intense
psychological
discomfort
when

ocd
is
often
associated
with
certain
forms
of

examples
of
obsessive

are
repeated
impulses
to
kill
a
loved
one
though
not
accompanied
by
anger
or
a
religious
person
having
recurrent
blasphemous
thoughts
generally
the
individual
attempts
to
ignore
or
suppress
the
intrusive
thoughts
by
engaging
in
other
activities
the
individual
realizes
that
the
thoughts
originate
from
the

rather
than
being

is
not
realistically

a

boy
born
with
seizures

occured
hours

he
was
immediately
transferred
to
a
major
hospital
in

has
since
been

extensive

treatment

this

my

not
only
in
learning
the
medical
problems
that
faced
our
son
but
also
in
dealing
with
hospitals
proceduresetc
i
dont
want
to
go
into
a
lot
of
detail
but
his
condition
was
termed
quite
severe
at
first
then
slowly
he
began
to
grow
and
put
on
weight
as
a
normal
baby
would
he
was
put
on
the
standard
anticonvulsion
drugs
and
that
did
not
seem
to
help
out
his
mri
ekg
catscans
are
all
normal
but
the
eegs
show
alot
of

activity
after
many
metabolic
tests
body
structure
tests
and
infectionvirus
tests
the
doctors
still
do
not
know
quite
what
type
of
siezures
he
is
having
although
they
do
have
alot
of
evidence
that
it
is
now
pointing
to
infantile
spasms
this
is
where
we
stand
right
now
if
anyone
knows
of
any
database
or
newsgroup
or
as
i
mentioned
up
above
any
information
relating
to
this
disorder
i
would
sure
appreciate
hearing
from
you
i
am
not
trying
to
play
doctor
here
but
only
trying
to
gather
information
about
it
as
i
know
now
these
particular
types
of

are
still
not

someone
i
know
has
recently
been
diagnosed
as
having
candida
albicans
a
disease
about
which
i
can
find
no
information
apparently
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
bodys
production
of
yeast
while
at
the
same
time
being
highly
allergic
to
yeast
can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
any
more
about
it
candida
albicans
can
cause
severe
lifethreatening
infections
usually
in
people
who
are
otherwise
quite
ill
this
is
not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by
mainstream
medicine
there
is
a
book
the
yeast
connection
which
talks
about
this
illness
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
for
example
dr
ivker
who
wrote
the
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
before
any
other
treatment
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
nizoral
to
his
new
patients
if
theyve
been
on
braodspectrum
antibiotics
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
hes
kept
a
record
of
the
results
and
for
over
patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
in
my
case
it
was
sinus
since
thats
the
center
of
my
allergic
response
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned

i
dont
understand
the
assumption
that
because
something
is
found
to

carcinogenic
that
it
would
not
be
legal
in

us
i
think
that
no
there
is
something
called
the
delany
amendment
which
makes
carcinogenic
food
additives
illegal
in
any
amount
this
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
before
stuff
like
mass
spectrometry
became
available
which
increased
detectable
levels
of
substances
by
a
couple
orders
of
magnitude
this
is
why
things
like
cyclamates
and
red
were
banned
they
are
very
weakly
carcinogenic
in
huge
quantities
in
rats
so
under
the
act
they
are
banned
this
also
applies
to
natural
carcinogens

might

suddenly
stopped

that

this
is

if
it
were
possible
to
market
a

good
like
the
old
days
someone
would
do
it
in
order
to
make
money
the
fact
that
no
one
does
it
indicates
that
enforcement
is
still
in
effect
an
odd
exception
to
the
rule
seems
to
be
the
product
known
as
gumbo
file
this
is
nothing
more
than
coarsely
ground
dried
sassafras
leaves
this
is
not
only
a
natural
product
but
a
natural
product
still
in
its
natural
form
so
maybe
thats
how
they
evade
delany
or
maybe
a
special
exemption
was
made
to
appease
powerful
louisiana
democrats
i
think
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
even
though
it
may
be
illegal
to
commercially
producesell
food
with

it
is
not

candida
monilia
this
disease
is
usually
caused
by
candida
albicans
a
fungus
that
we
all
carry
at
one
time
or
another
in
some
circumstances
though
the
organisms
proliferate
producing
symptomatic
infection
of
the
mouth
intestines
vagina
or
skin
when
the
mouth
or
vagina
are
infected
the
disease
is
commonly
called
thrush
vaginitis
caused
by
candida
often
afflicts
women
on
birth
control
pills
or
antibiotics
there
is
itching
and
a
white
cheesy
discharge
among
narcotic
addicts
candida
infections
can
lead
to
heart
valve
inflammation
diagnosis
of
candida
infections
is
confirmed
by
cultures
and
blood
tests
treatment
can
be
with
amphotericin
b
or
orally
with
ketoconazole
there
is
no
evidence
that
candida
in
the
intestine
of
normal
individuals
leads
to
disease
all
people
at
one
time
or
another
have
candida
in
their
intestines
claims
for
any
benefit
from
special
diets
or
chronic
antifungal
agents
is
not
based
on
any
solid

now
im
not
saying
that
culturing
is
the
best
way
to
diagnose
its
very
hard
to
culture
bb
in
most
cases
the
point
is
that
dr
n
has
developed
a
feel
for
what
is
and
what
isnt
ld
this
comes
from
years
of
experience
no
serology
can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr
n
a
quack
and
accuse
him
of
trying
to
make
a
quick
buck
why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a
quack
the
quacks
dont
do
cultures
they
poopoo
doing
more
lab
tests
this
is
lyme
believe
me
ive
seen
it
many
times
the
lab
tests
arent
accurate
well
treat
it
now
also
is
dr
ns
practice
almost
exclusively
devoted
to
treating
lyme
patients
i
dont
know
any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
are
you
arguing
that
the
lyme
lab
test
is
accurate
the
books
that
ive
read
say
that
in
general
the
tests
have
a
chance
of
being
correct
the
tests
result
in
a
large
number
of
both
false
positives
and
false
negatives
i
am
in
the
latter
case
we
could
get
those
same
odds
by
rolling

subject
any
info
on
vasomotor

i
recently
attended
an
allery
seminar
steroid
nasal
sprays
were
discussed
afterward
on
a
oneonone
basis
i
asked
the
speaker
what
if
none
of
the
vancanese
beconase
nasalide
nasalcort
or
nasalchrom
work
nor
do
any
oral
decongestants
work
she
replied
that
she
saw
an
article
on
vasomotor
rhinitis
that
this
is
not
an
allergic
reaction
and
that
nothing
other
than
the
afrins
and
such
would
work
which
in
my
case
is
true
i
want
to
find
out
as
much
as
possible
about
this
since
i
am
going
to
see
my
allergist
in
may
and
want
to
be
armed
to
the
hilt
with
information
since
nothing
he
has
done
with
me
has
helped
me
at
all
and
i
have
had
no
relief
for
months
please
respond
if
you
know
anything
about
this
andor
please
let
me
know
what
articles
might
be
helpful
that
i
could
look
up
in
the
library
subject
bates
method
for
myopia
does
the
bates
method
work
i
first
heard
about
it
in
this
newsgroup
several
years
ago
and
i
have
just
got
hold
of
a
book
how
to
improve
your
sight
simple
daily
drills
in
relaxation
by
margaret
d
corbett
authorized
instructor
of
the
bates
method
published
in
it
talks
about
vision
improvement
by
relaxation
and
exercise
has
there
been
any
study
on
whether
this
method
actually
works
if
it
works
is
it
by
actually
shortening
the
previously
elongated
eyeball
or
by
increasing
the
lenss
ability
to
flatten
itself
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
toolong
eyeball
since
myopia
is
the
result
of
eyeball
elongation
seems
to
me
the
most
logical
approach
for
correction
is
to
find
a
way
to
reverse
the
process
ie
shorten
it
somehow
preferably
nonsurgically
has
there
been
any
recent
studies
on
this
where
can
i
find
them
i
know
rk
works
by
changing
the
curvature
of
the
cornea
to
compensate
for
the
shape
of
eyeball
but
if
there
is
a
way
to
train
the
muscles
to
shorten
the
eyeball
back
to
its
correct
length
that
would
be
even
better
batess
idea

writes
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
snort
ah
there
go
my
sinuses
again
for
example
dr
ivker
who
wrote
the
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
oh
wow
a
classic
textbook
hey
they
laughed
at
einstein
too
before
any
other
treatment
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
nizoral
to
his
new
patients
if
theyve
been
on
braodspectrum
antibiotics
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
hes
kept
a
record
of
the
results
and
for
over
patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
this
are
worthless
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typical
hysterichypochondriac
who
responds
to
miracle
cures
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
me
so
of
course
it
should
be
taken
seriously
snort
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
yeah
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
oh
really
what
tests
immunecompromised
my
ass
more
like
credulous
malingerer
this
is
a
psychiatric
syndrome
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
you
know
its
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazole
is
being
misused
in
this
way
its
ridiculously
expensive
and
potentially
toxic
the
trouble
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
gets
abused
by
quacks
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
the
only
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
and
when
taken
orally
nontoxic
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
any
systemic
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
any
effect
on
your
sinuses
i
wish
these
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
people
like
you
that
would
solve
the
yeast
problem
once
and
for
all
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
perhaps
a
little
haldol
would
go
a
long
way
towards
ameliorating
your
symptoms
are
you
paying
for
this
treatment
out
of

basically
vasomotor
rhinitis

decongestants

effect

indeed
i
am
about
better
however
the
work
i
do
is
very
hard
and
i
am
still
not
able
to
go
back

the
thing
that

is
the

i
feel

hear

there
when
i
move
certain

i
heard
some
one
talking

they
broke

and
that
it
still
bothers
them
any

single

we

eventually

this

so
as

move
this

along
i
would
like
to
know
what

what
kinds

is

used
for
specifically
what

could
i
hope
that

could
be

its

improved

how

they

the

they

relief
of
pain
caused
by
cancer
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
proper
group
to
post
this
to
but
here
goes
anyway
about
five
years
ago
my
mother
was
diagnosed
with
having
cancer
in
the
lymph
nodes
under
one
of
her
arms
after
the
doctors
removed
the
cancerous
area
she
had
full
movement
of
her
arm
with
only
slight
aching
under
her
arm
when
she
moved
it
over
the
course
of
the
next
two
years
the
aching
got
more
severe
and
her
complaining
to
the
doctors
produced
the
explanation
that
it
was
scar
tissue
causing
the
pain
at
this
time
her
doctor
suggested
that
some
physiotherapy
should
be
employed
to
break
up
the
scar
tissue
while
attending
one
of
her
therapy
sessions
while
her
arm
was
being
manipulated
some
damage
occured
nerve
which
caused
the
level
of
pain
to
permanently
increase
severly
controlled
by
tylenol
and
some
loss
of
use
of
the
arm
palsied
wrist
and
almost
no
outward
lateral
movement
with
great
persistence
on
her
part
the
doctors
looked
further
into
the
issue
and
discovered
that
not
all
of
the
cancer
had
been
removed
and
another
tumor
had
grown
under
the
arm
this
was
removed
also
but
the
pain
in
the
arm
has
not
decreased
the
doctors
are
not
sure
exactly
why
the
pain
is
persisting
but
feel
some
sort
of
nerve
damage
has
occured
and
they
have
employed
tylenol
and
soon
morphine
to
relieve
the
pain
she
has
tried
acupuncture
by
this
only
provides
minor
reductions
in
pain
and
is
only
short
term
my
questions
are
has
anyone
has
heard
of
similar
cases
and
what
if
anything
was
done
to
reduce
the
levels
of
pain
are
their
methods
to
block
nerves
so
that
the
pain
can
be
reduced
are
their
methods
to
restore
nerves
so
that
loss
of
arm
function
can
be
restored
any
general
suggestions
on
pain
reduction
would
be
greatly
appreciated
please
respond
by
email
because
i
do
not
always
get
chance
to
read
this
group
if
anyone
knows
of
some
literature
that
may
be
useful
to
this
case
or
another
newsgroup
that

hey
they
laughed
at
einstein
too
before
any

a

such
as

to
his

if
theyve
been
on

antibiotics
or
more
times
in

hes
kept

and
for

patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
this
are
worthless
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typical
hysterichypochondriac
who
responds
to
miracle
cures
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
me
so
of
course
it
should
be
taken
seriously
snort
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
yeah
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
oh
really
what
tests
immunecompromised
my
ass
more
like
credulous
malingerer
this
is
a
psychiatric
syndrome
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
you
know
its
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazole
is
being
misused
in
this
way
its
ridiculously
expensive
and
potentially
toxic
the
trouble
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
gets
abused
by
quacks
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
the
only
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
and
when
taken
orally
nontoxic
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
any
systemic
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
any
effect
on
your
sinuses
i
wish
these
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
people
like
you
that
would
solve
the
yeast
problem
once
and
for
all
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold

firmly

party
line
are
academics

enough
actually

if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
perhaps
a
little
haldol
would
go
a
long
way

ameliorating
your
symptoms

threatening

the
funny
thing
is
the
personaly
stories
about
reactions
to
msg
vary
so
greatly
some
said
that
their
heart
beat
speeded
up
with
flush
face
some
claim
their
heart
skipped
beats
once
in
a
while
both
of
these
symptoms
are
related
tachycardia
getting
a
flushed
face
is
due
to
the
heart
pumping
the
blood
faster
than
a
regular
pulse
i
suspect
this
is
related
to
an
increase
in
sodium
levels
in
the
blood
since
note
sodium
chloride
monosodium
glutamate
both
are
sodium
compounds
our
bodies
require
sodium
but
like
everything
else
one
can
get
too
much
of
a
good
thing
some
reacted
with
headache
again
this
could
be
related
to
increased
blood
flow
from
increased
heart
rate
from
the
sodium
in
the
msg
distended
crainial
arteries
essentially
one
of
many
causes
of
headaches
there
is
no
discrepency
her
necessarily
some
stomach
ache
well
stomache
ache
and
vomiting
tend
to
be
related
again
not
necessarily
a
discrepency
more
likely
a
related
reaction
vomiting
occurs
as
a
response
to
get
rid
of
a
noxious
compound
an
organism
has
eaten
if
a
person
cant
digest
the
stuff
entirely
possible
the
list
of
stuff
people
are
allergic
to
is
quite
long
and
lacks
an
enzyme
to
break
it
down
gastrointestinal
distress
stomach
or
belly
ache
would
be
expected
some
had
watery
eyes
or
running
nose
these
are
respiratory
reactions
and
are
now
considered
to
be
similar
to
vomitting
they
are
a
way
for
the
body
to
dispose
of
noxious
compounds
they
are
adaptiove
responses
of
course
it
is
possible
some
other
food
or
environmental
compound
could
be
responsible
for
the
symptoms
but
its
important
to
remember
that
a
lot
opf
these
effets
can
be
additive
synergystic
subtractive
etc
etc
it
would
be
necessary
to
know
exactly
what
was
in
a
dish
and
what
else
the
person
was
exposed
to
respiratory
does
sound
suspicious
but
resopiration
and
heart
rate
are
connected
things
in
the
body
are
far
from
simplevery
inetractive
place
the
vertebrate
body
some
had
itchy
skin
or
rashes
people
respond
in
a
myriad
of
ways
to
the
same
compound
it
depends
upon
what
it
is
about
the
compound
that
pisses
off
their
body
pollen
for
example
of
some
plants
aggrivates
breathing
in
many
people
because
when
inhaled
it
sets
of
the
immune
system
and
an
histamine
attack
is
launched
the
immune
system
goes
overboard
causing
the
allergic
person
a
lot
of
misery
and
someone
with
an
allergy
to
some
pollens
will
have
trouble
with
some
herb
teas
that
contain
pollens
chamomile
linden
etc
drinking
the
substance
can
perturb
that
persons
system
as
much
as
inhaling
it
more
serious
accusations
include
respiration
difficulty
see
above
and
dont
think
that
heart
rate
changes
and
circulatory
problems
are
not
serious
they
can
be
deadly
and
brain
damage
the
area
of
the
brain
effected
is
the
neuroendocrine
system
controlling
the
release
of
gonadotropin
the
suprahormone
controlling
the
cyclical
release
of
testosterone
and
estradiol
as
well
as
somatostatin
and
other
steroids
testing
for
effective
dose
would
be
uh
a
wee
bit
unethical
now
here
is
a
new
one
vomiting
my
guess
is
that
msg
becomes
the
number
one
suspect
of
any
problem
in
this
case
it
might
be
just
food
poisoning
absolutely
but
it
could
also
be
some
synergystic
mess
from
eating
say
undetected
shrimp
or
mushrooms
to
which
many
are
allergic
plus
too
much
alcohol
and
inhaling
too
much
diesel
fumes
biking
home
plus
lets
say
having
contracted
flu
from
ones
sig
other
days
before
from
drinking
out
of
the
same
glass
could
be
all
sorts
of
things
but
it
might
be
the
msg
if
you
heard
things
about
msg
you
may
think
it
must
be
it
if
noone
else
got
sick
its
likely
not
food
poisoning
probably
stomach
flu
or
an
undetected
thing
the
guys
allergic
to
anyway
the
human
bodys
not
a
machine
people
vary
widely
in
their
responses
and
a
lot
of
reactions
are
due

combinations

why

i

give
me
some
reasons
why
is

an

that
needs
getting
get

not
although
i
would
think
that
a

like
you
would
be
a
big
fan
of
such
recycling
if
that
were
the

is
it
to
cover
up
the
fact
that
the
recipes
are
not
very
good
or
the
food
is
poor
quality
on
occasion
thats
probably
the
case
but
in
general
the
idea
is
that

improves
the
flavor
of
certain

do
some
of
you
get
a
sadistic
pleasure
out
of
making
some

sick
no
do
the
taste
testers
have
some
defect
in

sensors

etc
that

corrects
no
i
really
dont

obviously
also
nitrosiamines
sp
as
i
recall
these
are
natural
byproducts
of
heating
up
certain
foods
they
dont
put
it
in
there
have
a
number
of
criteria
in
choosing
how
to
process
food
they
want
to
make
it
taste
good
look
good
sell
for
a
good
price
etc
the
fact
that
they
use
it
tells
me
that
they
think
that
it
contributes
to
those
goals
they
are
interested
in
one
of
those
goals
is
not
making
people
sick
such
a
goal
woud
quickly
drive
them
out
of
business
and
for
no
benefit
i
think
outlaw
the
use
of
these
substances
without
warning
labels
as
large
as
those
on
cig
packages
warning
of
what
in
california
there
is
a
law
requiring
that
anything
which
contains
a
carcinogen
be
labeled
that
includes
every
gasline
pump
most
foods
and
even
money
cleaning
machines
because
nickel
is
a
mild
carcinogen
the
result
is
that
now
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
any
of
the
warnings
require
of
comparable
products
on
the
market
to
be
free
of
these
substances
and
state
that
they
are
free
of
msg
dyes
nitrosiamines
and
sulfites
on
the

why
what
if

it

these

demonstrate

fell
about
weeks
ago
down
into
the
hold
of
the
boat
and
broke
or
cracked
a
rib
and
wrenched
and
bruised
my
back
and
left
arm
my
question
i
have
been
to
a
doctor
and
was
told
that
it
was
best
to
do
nothing
and
it
would
heal
up
with
no
long
term
effect
and
indeed
i
am
about
better
however
the
work
i
do
is
very
hard
and
i
am
still
not
able
to
go
back
to
work
the
thing
that
worries
me
is
the
movement
or
clunking
i
feel
and
hear
back
there
when
i
move
certain
ways
i
heard
some
one
talking
about
the
rib
they
broke
years
ago
and
that
it
still
bothers
them
any
opinions
your
doctor
is
right
it
is
best
to
do
nothing
besides
taking
some
pain
medication
initially
some
patients
dont
like
this
and
expect
or
demand
to
have
something
done
in
these
cases
some
physicians
will
tape
the
patient
put
a
lot
of
heavy
adhesive
tape
around
the
chest
or
prescribe
an
elastic
binder
all
this
does
is
make
it
harder
to
breath
but
the
patient
doesnt
feel
cheated
because
soemthing
is
being
done
about
the
problem
either
way
the
end
results
are
the

my

seems
to
pound
a

more
than
at

also
it
is
very
dry
in

i
will
tend
to

is
there
something
else
that
i
could
do
an
unconventional
remedy
that
you
might
try
for
altitude
sickness
in
the
andes
is
chewing
coca
leaves
or
taking
teas
made
from
coca
leaves
you
might
notice
that
many
of
the
natives
have
wads
in
their

the
tea
can
be
obtained
in
s
american
pharmacies
this
remedy
alleviates
some
of
the
lightheadedness
and
dizziness
but
dont
try
to
jog
with
it
ive
tried
this
when
travelling
and
hiking
in
peru
and
ecuador
the
amount
of
cocaine
you
would
ingest
are
too
minute
to

also
it

dress

sudden
numbness
in
arm
i
experienced
a
sudden
numbness
in
my
left
arm
this
morning
just
after
i
completed
my
set
of
deep
squats
today
was
my
weight
training
day
and
i
was
just
beginning
my
routine
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
end
of
the
set
my
arm
felt
like
it
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
cold
turned
pale
and
lost
of
its
strength
the
weight
i
used
for
squats
wasnt
that
heavy
i
was
working
hard
but
not
at
effort
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
shake
the
arm
back
to
life
and
then
continued
with
chest
exercises
flyes
with
lighter
dumbells
than
i
normally
use
but
i
dropped
the
left
dumbell
during
the
first
set
and
experienced
continued
arm
weakness
into
the
second
so
i
quit
training
and
decided
not
to
do
my
usual
hour
on
the
ski
machine
either
ill
take
it
easy
for
the
rest
of
the
day
my
arm
is
still
somewhat
numb
and
significantly
weaker
than
normal
my
hand
still
tingles
a
bit
down
to
the
thumb
color
has
returned
to
normal
and
it
is
no
longer
cold
horrid
thoughts
of
chunks
of
plaque
blocking
a
major
artery
course
through
my
brain
im
vegetarian
and
pretty
fit
from
my
daily
exercise
regimen
so
that
cant
be
it
could
a
pinched
nerve
from
the
bar
cause
these
symptoms
i
hope
has
this
happened
to
anyone
else
nothing
like
this
has
ever
happened
to
me
before
does

last
saturday
evening
my
year
old
son
cut
his
finger
badly
with
a
knife
i
took
him
to
a
local
urgent
and
general
care
clinic
at
pm
the
clinic
was
open
till
pm
the
receptionist
went
to
the
back
and
told
the
doctor
that
we
were
there
and
came
back
and
told
us
the
doctor
would
not
see
us
because
she
had
someplace
to
go
at
and
did
not
want
to
be
delayed
here
during
the
next
few
minutes
in
response
to
my
questions
with
several
trips
to
the
back
room
the
receptionist
told
me
the
doctor
was
doing
paperwork
in
the
back
the
doctor
would
not
even
look
at
his
finger
to
advise
us
on
going
to
the
emergency
room
the
doctor
would
not
even
speak
to
me
she
would
not
tell
me
the
doctors
name
or
her
own
name
when
asked
who
is
in
charge
of
the
clinic
she
said
i
dont
know
i
realize
that
a
private
clinic
is
not
the
same
as
an
emergency
room
but
i
was
quite
angry
at
being
turned
away
because
the
doctor
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
my
son
did
get
three
stitches
at
the
emergency
room
im
still
trying
to
find
out
who
is
in

of
that
clinic
so
i
can
write

a

we
will
certainly
never

for

note
to

this

was
originally
a
takeoff
from

the
reason
for
the
formation
of
this
group
was
to
discuss
prescription
psychoactive
drugssuch
as
antidepressentstricyclics
prozac
lithiumetc
antipsychoticsmelleralsp
etc
ocd
drugsanafranil
etc
and
so
on
and
so
forth
it
didnt
take
long
for
this
group
to
degenerate
into
a
psudo

atmosphere
thats

bad
for
most

the
serious
folks
that
wanted
to
start
this
group
in

have
left
and
gone
back
to
scimed
where
you
have
to
cypher
through
hundreds
of
unrelated
articles
to
find
psychoactive
data
it
was
also
to
discuss
reallife
experiences
and
side
effects
of
the
above
mentioned
oh
well
i
had
unsubscribed
to
this

getting

someone

in

concern
about

from

needles
unless

themselves

is

they
will
get

generally
even
if
accidently

involved

needle

most
acupuncturists
use

do
this
because
you
are
not
the
only

concerned
about

its
good
business
to
advertise
disposable
needlesused
here
these
needles
tend
to
be
of
a
lower
quality
however
being
poorly
manufactured
and
too
sharp
in
my
opinion
they
tend
to
snag
bloodvessels
on
insertion
compared
to
higher
quality
needles
if
i
choose
to
use
acupuncture
for
a
given
complaint
that
patient
will
get
their
own
set
of
new
needles
which
are
sterilized
between

the
risk
here
for

that

could

imitrex
and
heart
attacks
my
girlfriend
just
started
taking
imitrex
for
her
migraine
headaches
her
neurologist
diagnosed
her
as
having
depression
and
suffering
from
rebound
headaches
due
to
daily
doses
of
analgesics
she
stopped
taking
all
analgesics
and
caffine
as
of
last
thursday
the
weekend
was
pretty
bad
but
she
made
it
through
with
the
help
of
imitrex
about
every
hours
her
third
injection
of
imitrex
during
the
worst
of
the
withdrawl
on
friday
and
six
hours
after
the
first
of
the
day
left
her
very
sick
skin
was
flushed
sweating
vomiting
and
had
severe
headache
pain
it
subsided
in
an
hour
or
so
since
then
she
has
been
taking
imitrex
as
needed
to
control
the
pain
immediately
after
taking
it
she
has
increased
head
pain
for
ten
minutes
dizziness
and
mild
nausea
and
mild
chest
pains
a
friend
of
hers
mentioned
that
her
doctor
was
wary
of
imitrex
because
it
had
caused
heart
attacks
in
several
people
apparently
the
mild
chest
pains
were
common
in
these
other
people
prior
to
there
attacks
is
this
just
rumor
has
anyone
else
heard
of
these
symptoms
my
girlfriend
also
has
mitral
valve
prolapse
opinions
are
mine
or
others
but
definately
not

lots

out
of
previuos
posts
here
is
another
anecdotal
story
i
am
a
picky
eater
and
never
wanted
to
try
chinese
food
however
i
finally
tried
some
in
order
to
please
a
girl
i
was
seeing
at
the
time
i
had
never
heard
of
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
a
group
of
us
went
to
the
restaurant
and
all
shared
different
dishes
it
didnt
taste
great
but
i
decided
it
wasnt
so
bad
we
went
home
and
went
to
bed
early
i
woke
up
at
am
and
puked
my
guts
outs
i
threw
up
for
so
long
that
im
not
kidding
i
pulled
a
muscle
in
my
tongue
dry
heaves
and
everything
no
one
else
got
sick
and
im
not
allergic
to
anything
that
i
know
of
suffice
to
say
that
i
wont
go
into
a
chinese
restaurant
unless
i
am
physically
threatened
the
smell
of
the
food
makes
me
ill
and
that
is
a
psycholgical
reaction
when
i
have
been
dragged
in
to
suffer
through
beef
and
broccoli
without
any
sauces
i
insist
on
no
msg
i
havent
gotten
sick
yet
funny
about
that
my
wife
my
girlfriend
at
the
time
used
to
get
sick
after
eating
certain
foods
at
various
asian
restaurants
and
never
knew
why
shed
go
pale
and
sweaty
and
then
vomit
copiously
a
couple
of
us
ventured
a
connection
with
msg
and
her
response
was
msg
whats
that
it
also
happened
when
she
pigged
out
on
some
brands
of
savoury
crackers
and
chips
which
i
noticed
later
had
msg
on
the
label
dont
know
about
double
blinds
but
avoiding
msg
has
stopped
her
being
sick
at
restaurants

i
experienced
a
sudden
numbness
in
my
left
arm
this
morning
just
after
i
completed
my
set
of
deep
squats
today
was
my
weight
training
day
and
i
was
just
beginning
my
routine
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
end
of
the
set
my
arm
felt
like
it
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
cold
turned
pale
and
lost
of
its
strength
the
weight
i
used
for
squats
wasnt
that
heavy
i
was
working
hard
but
not
at
effort
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
shake
the
arm
back
to
life
and
then
continued
with
chest
exercises
flyes
with
lighter
dumbells
than
i
normally
use
but
i
dropped
the
left
dumbell
during
the
first
set
and
experienced
continued
arm
weakness
into
the
second
so
i
quit
training
and
decided
not
to
do
my
usual
hour
on
the
ski
machine
either
ill
take
it
easy
for
the
rest
of
the
day
my
arm
is
still
somewhat
numb
and
significantly
weaker
than
normal
my
hand
still
tingles
a
bit
down
to
the
thumb
color
has
returned
to
normal
and
it
is
no
longer
cold

from

regimen
so
that
cant
be
it
could
a
pinched
nerve
from
the
bar
cause
these
symptoms
i
hope
it
likely
has
nothing
to
do
with
chunks
of
plaque
but
it
sounds
like
you
may
have
a
neurovascular
compromise
to
your

you
need

really
that

for

the

artifact
however
the
stable
culturepositivity
rate

the

indicates
that
the

one
possible
explanation
for
the
increased
occurrence
of

may

gang

drugrelated
sexual
behavior
as
implicated
in

the

editorial
note
the
findings
in
this

are
consistent
with
others
indicating
that
adults
who
do
not
use
safety
belts
themselves
are
less
likely
to
employ
occupant
restraints
for
their
children
because
these
nonbelted
adults
are
at
increased
risk
of
crashing
and
more
likely
to
exhibit
other
risktaking
behaviors
children
traveling
with
them
may
be
at
greater
risk
for
motorvehicle
injury
educational
attainment
of
adult
respondents
was
inversely
associated
with
child
restraint
use
in
this
report
accordingly
occupantprotection
programs
should
be
promoted
among
parents
with
low
educational
attainment
because
low
educational
attainment
is
often
associated
with
low
socioeconomic
status
such
programs
should
be
offered
to
adults
through
healthcare
facilities
that

lowincome
communities
or
through
federal
programs
ie

developing
the
technology
to
assist
couples
who
are
at

for
producing

with

disease
this
technology
involves
biopsying
the
preimplantation

and
then
subjecting
the
biopsied
cells
to
genetic
analysis
using
either
dna

there

recent
reports
of
the
successful
application
of
dna
amplification
by

for

for
probing
the

the
identification
of

will
provide
a

for

the
considerable
clinical
application
of
such

lies
in
the
fact
that
it

about

per

results
from
our
program
involving
patients
who
have
undergone
ivfet
cycles
reflect
a
comparable
success
rate
nevertheless
the
overall
incidence
of
success
with
this
procedure
is
disconcertingly
low
and
emphasizes
the
need
to
address
those
physiological
factors
that
limit
achievement
of
a
higher
percentage
of

well
recognized
predictors
of
outcome
include
patient
age
response
to
exogenous
ovarian
stimulation
quality
of
sperm
and
number
of
repeated
ivfet
cycle
attempts
however
among
these
age
is
the
single
most
significant
determinant
of
conception
therefore
it
is
critical
that
such
patients
are
referred
to
an
assisted
reproduction
program
at
the
earliest
opportunity
following
failure
of
traditional
therapies
the
underlying
basis
for
the
negative
effect
of
age
on
fertility
has
not
been
clearly
delineated
beyond
recognition
that
the
number
of
eggs
available
for
retrieval
declines
markedly
with
age
fertilization
rates
significantly
decrease
in
eggs
retrieved
from
patients
who
are
over
years
and
provided
the
appropriate
hormonal
background
is
present
age
is
unrelated
to
uterine
competency
to
sustain
pregnancy
ongoing
research
in
our
center
therefore
is
investigating
physiological
changes
in
the
egg
that
may
be
impacted
by
age
we
have
determined
that
more
than
percent
of
eggs
that
fail
to
fertilize
in
vitro
are
chromosomally
abnormal
and
that
a
significant
proportion
of
these
abnormalities
are
accountable
to
patient
age
currently
the
only
recourse
for
such
patients
is
to
use
eggs
obtained
from
a
donor
our
program
has
initiated
recruitment
of
volunteer
egg
donors
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
a
list
of
recipients
interested
in
this
form
of
therapy
gift
this
hightech
art
procedure
is
performed
in
the
operating
room
usually
with
the
use
of
a
laparoscope
and
in
contrast
to
ivfet
involves
introducing
sperm
and
freshly
retrieved
eggs
into
the
lumen
of
the
fallopian
tube
an
average
of
eggstube
under
these
circumstances
fertilization
occurs
in
vivo
and
if
excess
eggs
are
retrieved
the
remainder
undergo
ivf
with
subsequent
options
for

in

the

that
the
overall

obtained

the
ivfet
technique
range
of
clinical
pregnancies
for
gift
is
to

and
for
ivfet
to
percent
in
view
of
this
fact
one
might
expect
more
patients
to
be
treated
with
gift
than
ivfet
however
in
our
program
we
have
taken
into
account
three
basic
concerns
which
while
substantially
reducing
the
number
of
gift
cycles
performed
benefit
the
patient
these
concerns
are
the
increased
costs
associated
with
performing
a
procedure
in
the
operating
room
the
risks
albeit
minimal
of
undergoing
general
anesthesia
and
the
considerable
benefits
to
be
accrued
from
obtaining
direct
information
on
the
quality
and
fertilizability
of
the
eggs
and
the
developmental
competency
of
resultant
embryos
the
increased
success
with
gift
undoubtedly
reflects
the
artificial
environment
provided
by
the
laboratory
in
the
ivfet
procedure
between
january
and
december
we
have
performed
a
total
of
gift
cycles
with
an
overall
success
rate
of
percent
embryo
cryopreservation
or
freezing
is
applied
in
our
program
when
embryos
result
from
residual
gift
eggs
or
from
nontransferred
ivf
embryos
this
procedure
not
only
provides
patients
with
a
subsequent
opportunity
for
success
at
much
reduced
costs
but
also
circumvents
the
legal
and
ethical
issues
relating
to
disposal
of
supernumerary
embryos
therefore
as
stipulated
by
the
american
fertility
society
ethical
guidelines
for
art
programs
from
both
a
practical
and
an
ethical
standpoint
all
assisted

programs
should
have

of
cryopreserving

this
art
procedure
which
is
still
very
new
is
applied
to
couples
who
are
unaccepting
of

with
donor
semen
but
who
have
severe

infertility
less
than
million
spermml
in
combination
with
fewer
than
perccent
motile
sperm
andor
less
than

sperm
with

we
are
currently
developing
the
procedure
of
subzonal

szi
which
entails
injecting
sperm
under
the
coating
around
the
egg
the
barrier
normally
penetrated
by
the
sperm
through
enzymatic
digestion
available
data
from
szi
programs
worldwide
indicate
that
only
to
percent
of
szi
cycles
result
in
a
pregnancy
this
statistic
undoubtedly
relates
to
limitations
imposed
by
abnormalities
inherent
in
the
sperm
therefore
we
are
currently
focusing
on
the
development
of
improved
techniques
for
the
recognition
and
selection
of
sperm
chosen
for
manipulation
such
efforts
are
unquestionably
worthwhile
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
technology
offers
the
only
realistic
opportunity
for
severe

every

should
tackle
hiv
as
early
and
aggressively
as
possible
before
the

reaches
an
endemic

even
at
a
cost
of
diverting
less
attention
to

berkley
of
the
rockefeller
foundation
in

york
ny
in
reply
to
a
letter
by
drs
gellert
and
nordenberg
although
it
is
true
that
diseases
other
than
aids
such
as
malaria
and
respiratory
and
intestinal
illnesses
have
similarly
inhibited
economic
development
in
developing
countries
and
deserve
much
more
attention
than
they
are
getting
berkley
disagrees
with
the
contention
that
aids
is
receiving
too
much
attention
hiv
differs
from
other
diseases
in
most
developing
countries
because
it
is
continuing
to
spread
for
most
endemic
diseases
the
outcome
of
neglecting
interventions
for
one
year
is
another
year
of
about
the
same
level
of
needless
disease
and
death
but
with
aids
and
its
increasing
spread
the
cost
of
neglect
not
only
in
disease
burden
but
financially
is
much
greater
interventions
in
the
early
part
of
a
rampantly
spreading
epidemic
like
hiv
are
highly
costeffective
because
each
individual
infection
prevented
significantly
interrupts
transmission
berkley
says
he
agrees
with
gellert
and
nordenberg
about
the
gigantic
social
and
economic
effects
of
aids
and
about
the
need
for
political
leadership
but
he
concludes
that
not
only
is
assertive
political
leadership
needed
in
the
united
states
for
the
aids
epidemic
but
even
more
so
in
developing
countries
with
high
rates
of

infection

about

as
growing
numbers
of
women
of

expect
a
corresponding
increase

the
numbers
of

children
hiv
disease
progresses
more
rapidly
in
infants

the
most
recent

suggests
that

born
with

develop
a

these

include

new
evidence
that
the

can
cause

independently
news
from
the
national
institute
of
dental
research
there
is
new
evidence
that
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
can
cause
disease
independently
of
its
ability
to
suppress
the
immune
system
say
scientists
at
the
national
institues
of
health
they
report
that
hiv
itself
not
an
opportunistic
infection
caused
scaling
skin
conditions
to
develop
in
mice
carrying
the
genes
for
hiv
although
the
hiv
genes
were
active
in
the
mice
they
did
not
compromise
the
animals
immunity
the
researchers
found
this
led
them
to
conclude
that
the
hiv
itself
caused
the
skin
disease
our
findings
support
a
growing
body
of
evidence
that
hiv
can
cause
disease
without
affecting
the
immune
system

dr
kopp
and
his
colleagues
described
their
study
in
the
march
issue
of

research
and
human
retroviruses
developing
animal
models
of
hiv
infection
has
been
difficult
since
most
animals
including
mice
cannot
be
infected
by
the
virus
to
bypass
this
problem
scientists
have
developed
hivtransgenic
mice
which
carry
genes
for
hiv
as
well
as
their
own
genetic
material
nidr
scientists
created
the
transgenic
mice
by
injecting
hiv
genes
into
mouse
eggs
and
then
implanting
the
eggs
into
female
mice
the
resulting
litters
contained
both
normal
and
transgenic
animals
institute
scientists
had
created
mice
that
carried
a
complete
copy
of
hiv
genetic
material
in
those
mice
however
became
sick
and
died
too
soon
after
birth
to
study
in
depth
in
the
present
study
the
scientists
used
an
incomplete
copy
of
hiv
which
allowed
the
animals
to
live
longer
some
of
the
transgenic
animals
developed
scaling
wartlike
tumors
on
their
necks
and
backs
other
transgenic
mice
developed
thickened
crusting
skin
lesions
that
covered
most
of
their
bodies
resembling
psoriasis
in
humans
no
skin
lesions
developed
in
their
normal
nontransgenic
littermates
studies
of
tissue
taken
from
the
wartlike
skin
tumors
showed
that
they
were
a
type
of
noncancerous
tumor
called
papilloma
although
the
papillomavirus
can
cause
these
skin
lesions
laboratory
tests
showed
no
sign
of
that
virus
in

evidence
of
hiv
protein
production
proved
that
the
viral
genes
were
turned
on
or
active
said
dr
kopp
the
scientists
found
no
evidence
however
of
compromised
immunity
in
the
mice
no
increase
in
their
white
blood
cell
count
and
no
signs
of
common
infections
the
fact
that
hiv
genes
were
active
but
the
animals
immune
systems
were
not
suppressed
confirms
that
the
virus
itself
was
causing
the
skin
lesions
dr
kopp
said
further
proof
of
hiv
gene
involvement
came
from
a
test
in
which
the
scientists
exposed
the
transgenic
animals
to
ultraviolet
light
the
light
increased
hiv
genetic
activity
causing
papillomas
to
develop

papilloma
formation
in

to
increased
hiv

the

astemizole
is
most
definitely
linked
to
weight
gain
it
really
is
peculiar
that
some
antihistamines
have
this
effect
and
even
more
so
an
antihistamine
like
astemizole
which
purportedly
doesnt
cross
the
bloodbrain
barrier
and
so
tends
not
to
cause
drowsiness
it
also
gave
me
lots
of
problems
with
joint

muscle
pain
seemed
to

review
the

wordscan

is
a
product
of

it
runs
under

and
supports
that
accufont

of

initially
bringing

i

lets
me
select
which
parts
of
the

i
would
like
scanned
and
in
what
order
once
an
image
is
scanned
you
can
bring

the

gives
you
two

anything
in

yellow

which
are
words
that
wordscan
plus
doesnt
think
it
converted
correctly
at
all
i
have
found
that
the
software
should
give
itself
more
credit
it
is
usually
correct
instead
of
wrong
if
a
word
is
shaded
blue
you
can
add
it
to
your
personal
dictionary
the
only
problem
is
the
personal
dictionary
will
only
handle
about
words
i
find
this
to
be
very
limited
considering
how
many
medical
terms
are
not
in
a
normal
dictionary
after
a
document
is
converted
you
can
save
it
in
a
multitude
of
word
processor
formats
also
any
images
that
were
captured
can
be
stored
in
a

introduction
despite
predictions
earlier
this
century
that
infectious
diseases
would
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
public
health
problem
infectious
diseases
remain
the
major
cause
of
death
worldwide
and
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
united
states
since
the
early
the
us
public
health
system
has
been
challenged
by
a
myriad
of
newly
identified
pathogens
and
syndromes
eg
escherichia
coli
hepatitis
c
virus
human
immunodeficiency
virus
legionnaires
disease
lyme
disease
and
toxic
shock
syndrome
the
incidences
of
many
diseases
widely
presumed
to
be
under
control
such
as
cholera
malaria
and
tuberculosis
tb
have
increased
in
many
areas
furthermore
control
and
prevention
of
infectious
diseases
are
undermined
by
drug
resistance
in
conditions
such
as
gonorrhea
malaria
pneumococcal
disease
salmonellosis
shigellosis
tb
and
staphylococcal
infections
emerging
infections
place
a
disproportionate
burden
on
immunocompromised
persons
those
in
institutional
settings
eg
hospitals
and
child
day
care
centers
and
minority
and
underserved
populations
the
substantial
economic
burden
of
emerging
infections
on
the
us
healthcare
system
could
be
reduced
by
more
effective
surveillance
systems
and
targeted
control
and
prevention
programs
this
issue
of
mmwr
introduces
a
new
series
emerging

future

will
address
these
diseases

this
pathogen

an
important
cause
of
both
bloody
diarrhea
and
hus
the
most
common
cause
of
acute
renal
failure
in
children
outbreak
investigations
have
linked
most
cases
with
the
consumption
of
undercooked
ground
beef
although
other
food
vehicles
including
roast
beef
raw
milk
and
apple
cider
also
have
been
implicated
preliminary
data
from
a
cdc
nationwide
multicenter
study
revealed
that
when
stools
were
routinely
cultured
for
e

that
organism
was
isolated
more
frequently
than
shigella
in
four
of
participating
hospitals
and
was
isolated
from
of
all
bloody
stools
a
higher
rate
than
for
any
other

the
difficulties
in
recognizing
community

low
levels
of
airborne
particles
linked
to
serious
asthma
attacks
american
lung
association
a
new
study
published
by
the
american
lung
association
has
shown
that
surprisingly
low
concentrations
of
airborne
particles
can
send
people
with
asthma
rushing
to
emergency
rooms
for
treatment
the
seattlebased
study
showed
that
roughly
one
in
eight
emergency
visits
for
asthma
in
that
city
was
linked
to
exposure
to
particulate
air
pollution
the
actual
exposure
levels
recorded
in
the
study
were
far
below
those
deemed
unsafe
under
federal
air
quality
laws
people
with
asthma
have
inflamed
airways
and
airborne
particles
tend
to
exacerbate
that
inflammation
said
joel
schwartz
phd
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
who
was
the
lead
author
of
the
study
when
people
are
on
the
threshold
of
having
a
serious
asthma
attack
particles
can
push
them
over
the
edge
the
seattle
study
correlated
months
of
asthma
emergency
room
visits
with
daily
levels
of
pm
or
particulate
matter
with
an
aerodynamic
diameter
of
microns
or
less
these
finer
particles
are
considered
hazardous
because
they
are
small
enough
penetrate
into
the
lung
cities
are
considered
out
of
compliance
with
clean
air
laws
if
the
average
concentration
of
exceeds
micrograms
per
cubic
millimeter
of
air
in
seattle
however
a
link
between
fine
particles
and
asthma
was
found
at
levels
as
low
as
micrograms
the
authors
concluded
that
for
every
microgram
increase
in
the
fourday
average
of
the
odds
of
someone
with
asthma
needing
emergency
treatment
increased
by
percent
the
findings
were
published
in
the
april
american
review
of
respiratory
disease
an
official
journal
of
the
american
thoracic
society
the
lung
associations
medical
section
the
study
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
recent
reports
to
suggest
that
particulate
matter
is
a
greatly
under
appreciated
health
threat
a
study
by
dr
schwartz
and
douglas
dockery
phd
of
harvard
found
that
particles
may
be
causing
roughly
premature
deaths
each
year
in
the
united
states
other
studies
have
linked
particulate
matter
to
increased
respiratory
symptoms
and
bronchitis
in
children
government
officials
and
the
media
are
still
very
focused
on
ozone
says
dr
schwartz
but
more
and
more
research
is
showing
that
particles
are
bad
actors
as
well
one
problem
in
setting
standards
for
particulate
air
pollution
is
that
pmio
is
difficult
to
study
unlike
other
regulated
pollutants
such
as

and

of

pollution
says
dr
schwartz
we
have
no
way
of
duplicating
the
typical
urban
mix
of
particles
consequently
most
of
what
is
known
about
particulates
has
been
learned
through

research
like
the
seattle
study
given
that
the
epas
current
priority
is
to

the

sulfur

standards
the
agency
is
unlikely
to
reexamine
the
standard
any
time
soon
until
changes
are
made
there
appears

be
little
people
with
asthma

do
to
protect
themselves
from
airborne
particles
in
some
areas
you

the
reports
only
cover
the
pollutant
that
is
closest
to

its
standard

to

multiple

instead
of

allowing

sources
said
thursday
the
decision
ends
the
controversy
between
army
aids
researchers
who
had
hoped
to
test
a
vaccine
made
by
microgenesys
inc
and
the
national
institutes
of
health
which
contended
that
multiple
vaccines
should
be
tested
health

human
services
secretary
donna
shalala
said
a
final
announcement
on
the
therapeutic
vaccine
trials
was
expected
to
be
made
last
friday
companies
including
genentech
inc
chiron
corp
and
immuno
ag
have
already
told
nih
that
they
are
prepared
to
participate
in
the
vaccine
tests
the
testing
is
intended
to
demonstrate
whether
aids
vaccines
are
effective
in
thwarting
the
replication
of
hiv
in
patients
already
infected
shalala
refuted
last
weeks
reports
that
the
clinton
administration
had
decided
the
armys
test
of
the
microgenesys
vaxsyn
should
proceed
without
tests
of
others
at
the
same
time
the
report
was
inaccurate
and
i
expect
there
to
be
some
announcement
in
the
next
hours
about
that
particular
aids
research
project
said
shalala
administration
sources
subsequently
confirmed
that
nih
director
dr
bernadine
healy
and
food
and
drug
administration
commissioner
david
kessler
had
convinced
the
white
house
that
multiple
vaccines
should
be
tested
simultaneously
but
microgenesys
president
frank
volvovitz
said
a
test
of
multiple
vaccines
could
triple
the
cost
of
the
trial
and
delay
it

two

no

in

current

than

something
causing

but

they
found
no
changes
in

from
one
absurd
perspective
all

is
neurologic
because
in
the
absence

system
there
would
not

pain
from
another
tautologic
perspective
any

is
in

neurologists
treat

therefore
at

in

headache
is
neurologic
whether
neurologic

still
has

with
no

i
had

listen
thrush
is
a
recognized
clinical
syndrome
with
definite
characteristics
if
you
have
thrush
you
have
thrush
because
you
can
see
the
lesions
and
do
a

and
when
you
treat
it
it
generally
responds

here
nor
are
these
walking
neurasthenics
who
are
convinced
they
have
candida
from
reading
a
quack
book
yawn
my
dentist
who
sees
a
fair
amount
of
thrush
recommended
acidophilous
after
i
began
taking
acidophilous
on
a
daily
basis
the
outbreaks
ceased
when
i
quit
taking
the
acidophilous
the
outbreaks
periodically
resumed
i
resumed
taking
the
acidophilous
with
no
further
outbreaks
since
then
so

neurofibromatosis
hello
i
am
writing
a
grant
proposal
for
a
developmental
genetics
class
and
i
have
chose
to
look
at
the
neurofibromatosis
gene
and
its
variable
expressivity
i
am
curious
what
has
already
been
done
on
this
subject
especially
the
relationship
between
specific
mutations
and
the
resulting
phenotype
my
literature
search
has
produce
many
references
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
am
proposing
new
research
if
anyone
knows
aything
that
has
been
recently
or
key
peopl
doing
research
to
search
for
using
medline
i
would
apprciate
being
informed

there

of

by
taking

he
also
claims
that

are

in
the

yes
have
you
used

for

it
seems
to
work
equally
well
for

another
hint
that
these
may
be
different

underlying

have
you
gotten
good

with

yes
the

is

for

it

worked

continued

i
currently
reserve
it
for

it

sometime

its

freedom

they

and
its
well
recognized
by
many
doctors
that

certainly
we

the

is
what
is
the

medical
knowledge
the
scientific
method
has
proven
itself
to
be
reliable
the
only
reason
alternative

are
shunned
by
physicians
is
that
their
practitioners
refuse
to
submit
their
theories
to
rigorous
scientific
scrutiny
insisting
that
tradition
or
anecdotal
evidence
are
sufficient
these
have
been
shown
many

to
be
very
unreliable
ways

crooks

this

is
universally
and

rapidly

was
growing
rapidly

the

checked
extensively
on

he
spoke
to
a

in

for
a

from

my

who
sees
a

amount
of
thrush
recommended
acidophilous
after
i
began
taking
acidophilous
on
a
daily
basis
the
outbreaks
ceased
when
i
quit
taking
the
acidophilous
the
outbreaks
periodically
resumed
i
resumed
taking
the
acidophilous
with
no
further
outbreaks
since
then
this
is
the
second
post
which
seems
to
be
blurring
the
distinction
between
real
disease
caused
by
candida
albicans
and
the
disease
that
was
being
asked
about
systemic
yeast
syndrome
there
is
no
question
that
candida
albicans
causes
thrush
it
also
seems
to
be
the
case
that
active
yogurt
cultures
with
acidophilous
may
reduce
recurrences
of
thrush
at
least
for
vaginal
thrush
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
taking
it
for
oral
thrush
before
though
presumably
it
would
work
by
the
same
mechanism
candida
is
clearly
a
common
minor
pathogen
and
a
less
common
major
pathogen
that
does
not
mean
that
there
is
evidence
that
it
causes
the
systemic
yeast
syndrome

opinions
on
allergy
hay
fever
shots
hello
i
am
interested
in
trying
this
desensitization
method
against
hay
fever
what
is
the
state
of
affairs
about
this
i
went
to
a
doctor
and
paid
for
a
minute
interview
scratches
leading
to
the
diagnostic
that
i
am
allergic
to
june
and
timothy
grass
i
believe
this
from
now
on
it
looks
like
shots
per
week
for
months
followed
by
shot
per
month
or
so
each
shot
costs
talking
about
soaring
costs
and
the
health
care
system
i
would
call
that
a
racket
we
are
not
talking
about
rare
amazonian
grasses
here
but
the
garbage
which
grows
behind
the
doctors
office
apart
from
this
issue
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
to
find
out
that
you
have
to
keep
getting
the
shots
forever
is
that
right
thanks
for

re

writes
this
group
was
originally
a
takeoff
from
scimed
the
reason
for
the
formation
of
this
group
was
to
discuss
prescription
psychoactive
drugssuch
as
oh
well
obviously
no
one
really
cares
then
let
me
ask
you
for
a
workable
solution
we
have
a
name
here
that
implies
certain
things
to
many
people
rather
than
trying
to
educate
each
and
every
person
that
comes
to
the
group
is
there
some
name
that
would
imply
what
this
group
was
originally
intended
for
my
dad
was
a
lawyer
as
such
i
grew
up
with
being
a
stickler
for
meaning
in
my
reality
psychoactives
technically
could
range
from
caffeine
to
datura
to
the
drugs
you
mention
to
more
standard
recreational
drugs
in
practice
i
had
hoped
to
see
it
limited
to
those
that
were
above
some
psychoactive
level
like
some
of
the
drugs
you
mention
but
also
possibly
including
some
recreational
drugs
but
with
conversation
limited
to
their
psychoactive
effects
the
recent
query
about
bong
water
i
thought
was
a
bit
off
topic
so
i
just
hit
k
but
back
to
the
original
question
what
is
a
workable
solution
what
is
a
workable
name
that
would
imply
the
topic
you
with
to
discuss
it
sounds
like
there
should
be
a
altsmartdrugs
or
something
similar
i
dont
feel
psychoactives
would
generally
be
used
to
describe
alot
of
those
drugs
there
is
a
big
difference
between
a
drug
that
if
taken
in
certain
doses
over
a
period
of
days
may
have
a
psychoactive
effect
in
some
people
vs
many
of
the
drugs
in
pihkah
which
are
psychoactive
wm
if
prochoice
means
choice
after

does
this
apply
to

too

this
what

about
the

the

many
of

cornbased
after

i
looked
in

and
located
two
articles
that
implicated
corn

the
idea
is
that
corn
in

might
potentiate
an

not

berry

is
corn

has
also
never

eating

corn
on

that

in

the
point
is
that
dr

developed
a
feel
for
what
is

what
isnt

this
comes
from
years
of

no

can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr

a

and
accuse
him
of
trying

why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a

the
quacks
dont

they
poopoo

this
is

believe
me
ive
seen
it
many

the

arent

well
treat
it

also
is
dr

almost

devoted

i
dont

any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
no
he
does
not
exclusively
treat

patients
however
in
some
parts
of
the
country
you
dont
need
to
be
known
as
an
ld
specialist
to
see
a
large
number
of
ld
patients
walk
through
your
office
given
the
huge
problem
of
underdiagnosis
orthopedists
encounter
late
manifestations
of
the
disease
just
about
every
day
in
their
regular
practices
dr
n
told
me
that
last
year
he
sent
between
and
patients
a
week
to
the
ld
specialists
and
he
is
not
the
only
orthopedists
in
the
town
lets
say
that
only
people
per
week
actually
have
ld
that
means
at
the
very
minimum
people
in
our
town
and
immediate
area
develop
late
stage
manifestations
of
ld
every
year
add
in
the
folks
who
were
diagnosed
by
neurologists
rheumatologists
gps
etc
and
you
can
see
what
kind
of
problem
we
have
no
wonder
just
about
everybody
in
town
personally
knows
an
ld
patient
he
refers
most
patients
to
ld
specialists
but
in
extreme
cases
he
puts
the
patient
on
medication
immediately
to
minimize
the
damage
in
most

to

an

prof
mick

rutgers
university
this
overview
of
the
essential
facts
of
molecular
biology
is
intended
as
an
introduction
to
the
field
for
computer
scientists
who
wish
to
apply
their
tools
to
this
rich
and
complex
domain
material
covered
will
include
structural
and
informational
molecules
the
basic
organization
of
the
cell
and
of
genetic
material
the
central
dogma
of
gene
expression
and
selected
other
topics
in
the
area
of
structure
function
and
regulation
as
relates
to
current
computational
approaches
dr
noordewier
has
appointments
in
both
computer
science
and
biology
at
rutgers
and
has
extensive
experience
in
basic
biological
research
in

an
overview
of
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
will
be
presented
as
it
relates
to
actual
and
potential
biological
applications
fundamental
techniques
symbolic
programming
languages
and
notions
of
search
will
be
discussed
as
well
as
selected
topics
in
somewhat
greater
detail
such
as
knowledge
representation
inference
and
machine
learning
the
intended
audience
includes
biologists
with
some
computational
background
but
no
extensive
exposure
to
artificial
intelligence
dr
lathrop
codeveloper
of
ariadne
and
related
technologies
has
worked
in
the
area
of
artificial
intelligence
applied
to
biological
problems
in
both
academia
and
industry
neural
networks
statistics
and
information
theory
in
biological
sequence
analysis
dr
alan
lapedes
los
alamos
national
laboratory
this
tutorial
will
cover
the
most
rapidlyexpanding
facet
of
intelligent
systems
for
molecular
biology
that
of
machine
learning
techniques
applied
to
sequence
analysis
closely
interrelated
topics
to
be
addressed
include
the
use
of
artifical
neural
networks
to
elicit
both
specific
signals
and
general
characteristics
of
sequences
and
the
relationship
of
such
approaches
to
statistical
techniques
and
informationtheoretic
views
of
sequence
data
dr
lapedes
of
the
theoretical
division
at
los
alamos
has
long
been
a
leader
in
the
use
of
such
techniques
in
this
domain
genetic
algorithms
and
genetic
programming
prof
john
koza
stanford
university
the
genetic
algorithm
an
increasingly
popular
approach
to
highly
nonlinear
multidimensional
optimization
problems
was
originally
inspired
by
a
biological
metaphor
this
tutorial
will
cover
both
the
biological
motivations
and
the
actual
implementation
and
characteristics
of
the
algorithm
genetic
programming
an
extension
wellsuited
to
problems
where
the
discovery
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
solution
is
a
major
part
of
the
problem
will
also
be
addressed
particular
attention
will
be
paid
to
biological
applications
and
to
identifying
resources
and
software
that
will
permit
attendees
to
begin
using
the
methods
dr
koza
a
consulting
professor
of
computer
science
at
stanford
has
taught
this
subject
since
and
is
the
author
of
a

in
the
field
linguistic

prof
david
searls
university
of
pennsylvania
shmuel
pietrokovski
weizmann
institute
approaches
to
sequence
analysis
based
on
linguistic
methodologies
are
increasingly
in
evidence
these
involve
the
adaptation
of
tools
and
techniques
from
computational
linguistics
for
syntactic
pattern
recognition
and
gene
prediction
the
classification
of
genetic
structures
and
phenomena
using
formal
language
theory
the
identification
of
significant
vocabularies
and
overlapping
codes
in
sequence
data
and
sequence
comparison
reflecting
taxonomic
and
functional
relatedness
dr
searls
who
holds
research
faculty
appointments
in
both
genetics
and
computer
science
at
penn
represents
the
branch
of
this
field

for

are
good
that

in

segment
entitled

show
host
ed
bradley
makes
alarming
statements
without
adequately
substantiating
them
millions
are
suffering
a
host
of
symptoms
and
some
get
violently
sick
peppers
his
report
with
sensational
but
clinically
unproven
personal
testimony
and
speaks
of
studies
on
msg
that
make
the
substance
seem
harmful
without
explaining
just
how
inconclusive
those
studies
are
consider
his
making
reference
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
to
a
study
conducted
at
the
eastern
virginia
medical
school
in
order
to
back
up
his
comment
that
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
msg
a
flavor
enhancer
in
chinese
and
other
asian
cuisines
as
well
as
in
many
supermarket
items
causes
headaches
what
he
does
not
make
reference
to
is
the
fact
that
the
study
was
performed
not
on
humans
but
on
rabbits
one
of
the
researchers
who
conducted
the
study
pharmacologist
patricia
williams
phd
says
it
certainly
is
conceivable
that
a
small
minority
of
people
are
sensitive
enough
to
msg
to
get
headaches
from
it
but
she
explains
the
show
probably
overemphasized
the
extent
of
the
problem
a
second
lapse
comes
with
mention
of
dr
john
olney
a
professor
at
the
washington
university
school
of
medicine
who
mr
bradley
remarks
says
that
his
years
of
research
with
laboratory
animals
shows
msg
is
a
hazard
for
developing
youngsters
because
it
poses
a
threat
of
irreversible
brain
damage
dr
olneys
research
with
lab
animals
does
not
show
anything
about
human
youngsters
in
fact
only
under
extreme
circumsrtances
did
dr
olneys
experiments
ever
bring
about
any
brain
damage
when
he
injected
extremely
high
doses
of
msg
into
rodents
completely
bypassing
their
digestive
tracts
and
entering
their
bloodstreams
more
directly
and
when
he
used
tubes
to
forcefeed
huge
amounts
of
the
substance
to
very
young
animals
on
an
empty
stomach
of
course
neither
of
those
procedures
occurs
with
humans
they
simply
take
in
msg
with
food
and
most
of
what
they
take
in
is
broken
down
by
enzymes
in
the
wall
of
the
small
intestine
so
that
very
little
reaches
the
bloodstream
much
to
little
in
fact
for
human
blood
levels
of
msg
to
come
anywhere
near
the
high
concentrations
found
in
dr
olneys
lab
animals
the
world
health
organization
appears
to
be
very
much
aware
of
that
fact
and
so
does
the
european
communities
scientific
committee
for
foodboth
after
examining
numerous
studies
have
concluded
that
msg
is
safe
their
determination
makes
sense
considering
that
msg
has
never
been
proven
to
cause
all
the
symptoms
that
have
been
attributed
to
it
headaches
swelling
a
tightness
in
the
chest
and
a
burning
sensation
among
others
in
fact
the
most
failsafe
of
clinical
studies
the
doubleblind
study
has
consistently
exonerated
the
muchmaligned
substance
thats
quite
fortunate
since
the
alleged
hazardous
component
of
monosodium
glutamate
glutamate
enters
our
systems
whenever
we
eat
any
food
that
contains
protein
the
reason
is
that
one
of
the
amino
acids
that
make
up
protein
glutamic
acid
is
broken
down
into
glutamate
during
digestion
its
a
breakdown
that
occurs
frequently
glutamic
acid
is
the
most
abundant
of
the
or
so
amino
acids
in
the
diet
it
makes
up
about
percent
of
the
protein
in
flesh
foods
percent
in
milk
percent
in
corn
and
percent
in
whole
wheat
that
doesnt
mean
its
entirely
unimaginable
that
a
small
number
of
people
have
trouble
metabolizing
msg
properly
and
are
therefore
sensitive
to
itthe
consensus
reached
by
large
international
professional
organizations
is
that
msg
is
safe
the
same
consensus
reached
by
the

in

pissed
off
at
this

last
saturday
evening
my
year
old
son
cut
his
finger
badly
with
a
knife
i
took
him
to
a
local
urgent
and
general
care
clinic
at
pm
the
clinic
was
open
till
pm
the
receptionist
went
to
the
back
and
told
the
doctor
that
we
were
there
and
came
back
and
told
us
the
doctor
would
not
see
us
because
she
had
someplace
to
go
at
and
did
not
want
to
be
delayed
here
during
the
next
few
minutes
in
response
to
my
questions
with
several
trips
to
the
back
room
the
receptionist
told
me
the
doctor
was
doing
paperwork
in
the
back
the
doctor
would
not
even
look
at
his
finger
to
advise
us
on
going
to
the
emergency
room
the
doctor
would
not
even
speak
to
me
she
would
not
tell
me
the
doctors
name
or
her
own
name
when
asked
who
is
in
charge
of
the
clinic
she
said
i
dont
know
i
realize
that
a
private
clinic
is
not
the
same
as
an
emergency
room
but
i
was
quite
angry
at
being
turned
away
because
the
doctor
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
my
son
did
get
three
stitches
at
the
emergency
room
speaking
as
a
physician
who
works
in
an
urgent
care
center
the
above
behavior
is
completely
inappropriate
if
a
patient
who
requires
extensive
care
shows
up
at
the
last
minute
we
always
see
them
and
give
them
appropriate
care
it
is
reasonable
for
a
clinic
to
refuse
to
see
patients
outside
of
its
posted
hours
but
what
you
describe
is
misbehavior
ask
to
speak
to
the
clinic
director
and
complain
whatever
their
attitude
they
have
nothing
to
gain
from
angering
patients

jgecsuncedu
if
she
is
having
problems
with
fresh
vegetables
the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruction
of
the
intestine
without
knowing
more
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
obstruction
is
permanent
due
to
scarring
or
temporary
due
to
swelling
of
inflammed
intestine
in
general
there
are
no
dietary
limitations
in
patients
with
crohns
except
as
they
relate
to
obstruction
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
foods
will
bring
on
recurrence
of
crohns
it
is
important
to
distinguish
recurrence
from
recurrent
symptoms
a
physician
would
think
of
new
inflammation
as
recurrence
while
pains
from
raw
veggies
just
imply
a
narrowing
of
the
intestine
your

should
look
into
membership
in

some

are
doing

as

let

tell

who
the

really

these
are
the
physicans
who
have
no
idea
how
the
human
body
interacts
with
its

and
how
that
balance
can
be
altered
by
diet
and
antibiotics
these
are
the
physicians
who
dismiss
their

with
difficult
symptomatology
and
make
them
go
from
doctor
to

to
find
relieflike
elaine
in

then
when
they
find
one
that
solves
their

the
rest
start
yelling
quack
could
it
just
be
professional
jealousy
i
couldnt
help
elaine
or
jon
but
somebody
else
did
could
they
know
more
than
me
no
way
they
must
be
a
quack
ive
been
teaching
a
human
nutrition
course
for
medical
students
for
over
ten
years
now
and
guess
who
the
most
receptive
students
are
those
that
were
raised
on
farms
and
saw
firsthand
the
effect
of
diet
on
the
health
of
their
farm
animals
and
those
students
who
had
made
a
dramatic
diet
change
prior
to
entering
medical
schoolswitched
to
the
vegan
diet
typically
this
is
about
of
my
class
of
students
those
not
interested
in
nutrition
either
tune
me
out
or
just
stop
coming
to
class
thats
okay
because
i
know
that
some
of
what
im
teaching
is
going
to
stick
and
there
will
be
at
least
a
few
enlightened
physicians
practicing
in
the
us
its
really
too
bad
that
most
us
medical
schools
dont
cover
nutrition
because
if
they
did
candida
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
in
animal
husbandry
an
animal
is
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotics
are
stopped
medicine
has
decided
that
since
humans
do
not
have
a
ruminant
stomach
no
such
reinnoculation
with
good
bacteria
is
needed
after
coming
off
a
braod
spectrum
antibiotic
humans
have
all
kinds
of
different
organisms
living
in
the
gi
systemmouth
stomach
small
and
large
intestine
sinuses
vagina
and
on
the
skin
these
are
nonpathogenic
because
they
do
not
cause
disease
in
people
unless
the
immune
system
is
compromised
they
are
also
called
nonpathogens
because
unlike
the
pathogenic
organisms
that
cause
human
disease
they
do
not
produce
toxins
as
they
live
out
their
merry
existence
in
and
on
our
body
but
any
of
these
organisms
will
be
considered
pathogenic
if
it
manages
to
take
up
residence
within
the
body
a
poor
mucus
membrane
barrier
can
let
this
happen
and
vitamin
a
is
mainly
responsible
for
setting
up
this
barrier
steve
got
real
upset
with
elaines
doctor
because
he
was
using
antifungals
and
vitamin
a
for
her
gi
problems
if
steve
really
understoood
what

a
does
in
the
body
he
would
notor
at

should
not
be

here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
an
infection
caused
by
this
organism
is
called
candidiasis
candidiasis
is
a
very
rare
occurance
because
like
an
e
coli
infection
it
requires
that
the
host
immune
system
be
severly
depressed
candida
is
frequently
found
on
the
skin
and
all
of
the
mucous
membranes
of
normal
healthy
people
and
it
rarely
becomes
a
problem
unless
some
predisposing
factor
is
present
such
as
a
high
blood
glucose
leveldiabetes
or
an
oral
course
of
antibiotics
has
been
used
in
diabetics
their
secretions
contain
much
higher
amounts
of
glucose
candida
unlike
bacteria
is
very
limited
in
its
foodfuel
selection
without
glucose
it
can
not
grow
it
just
barely
survives
if
it
gets
access
to
a
lot
of
glucose
it
blooms
and
over
rides
the
other
organisms
living
with
it
in
the
sinuses
gi
tract
or
vagina
in
diabetics
skin
lesions
can
also
foster
a
good
bloom
site
for
these
little
buggers
the
bloom
is
usually
just
a
minor
irritant
in
most
people
but
some
people
do
really
develop
a
bad
inflammatory
process
at
the
mucus
membrane
or
skin
bloom
site
whether
this
is
an
allergic
like
reaction
to
the
candida
or
not
isnt
certain
when
the
bloom
is
in
the
vagina
or
on
the
skin
it
can
be
easliy
seen
and
some
doctors
do
then
try
to
treat
it
if
its
internal
only
symptoms
can
be
used
and
these
symptoms
are
pretty
nondiscript
candida
is
kept
in
check
in
most
people
by
the
normal
bacterial
flora
in
the
sinuses
the
gi
tractmouth
stomach
and
intestines
and
in
the
vaginal
tract
which
compete
with
it
for
food
the
human
immune
system
ususally
does
not
bother
itself
with
thesenonpathogenic
organisms
unless
they
broach
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
if
they
do
an
inflammatory
response
will
be
set
up
most
americans
are
not
getting
enough
vitamin
a
from
their
diets
about
of
all
americans
die
with
less
vitamin
a
than
they
were
born
withus
autopsy
studies
while
this
low
level
of
vitamin
a
does
not
cause
pathologyblindness
it
does
impair
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
this
would
then
be
a
predisposing
factor
for
a
strong
inflammatory
response
after
a
candida
bloom
while
diabetics
can
suffer
from
a
candida
bloom
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
bloom
is
the
use
of
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
which
knock
down
many
different
kinds
of
bacteria
in
the
body
and
remove
the
main
competition
for
candida
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
while
drugs
are
available
to
handle
candida
many
patients
find
that
their
doctor
will
not
use
them
unless
there
is
evidence
of
a
systemic
infection
the
toxicity
of
the
antifungal
drugs
does
warrant
some
caution
but
if
the
gi
or
sinus
inflammation
is
suspected
to
be
candidaand
recent
use
of
a
broad
spectrum
antibiotic
is
the
smoking
gun
then
antifungal
use
should
be
approrpriate
just
as
the
antifungal
creams
are
an
appropriate
treatment
for
recurring
vaginal
yeast
infections
in
spite
of
what
mr
steve
dyer
says
but
even
in
patients
being
given
the
antifungals
the
irritation
caused
by
the
excessive
candida
bloom
in
the
sinus
gi
tract
or
the
vagina
tends
to
return
after
drug
treatment
is
discontinued

the

most

organism

in

l
acidophilius

you
are
hit
with
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
in
the
gi
system
the
anorectal
region
seems
to
be
a
particularly
good
reservoir
for
candida
and
the
use
of
pantyhose
by
many
women
creates
a
very
favorable
environment
around
the
rectum
for
transferthrough
moisture
and
humidity
of
candida
to
the
vaginal
tract
one
of
the
most
effctive
ways
to
minimmize
this
transfer
is
to
wear
undyed
cotton
underwear
if
the
bloom
occurs
in
the
anal
area
the
burning
swelling
pain
and
even

steve

candida
prefers
a
slightly
alkaline
environment
while
bacteria
tend
to
prefer
a
slightly
acidic
environment
the
vagina
becomes
alkaline
during
a
womans
period
and
this
is
often
when
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina

and
water
douches
are

way

problems

problem

control

searched
for
over

found
a

who
solved

rather
than
just

that

the

l
acidophilus
is
an
acid
producing
bacteria
which
is
the
most
common
bacteria
found
in
the
vaginal
tract
of
healthy
women
if
taken
orally
it
can
also
become
a
major
bacteria
in
the
gut
through
aresol
sprays
it
has
also
been
used
to
innoculate
the
sinus
membranes
but
before
this
innoculation
occurs
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
needs
to
be
strengthened
this
is
accomplished
by
vitamin

and
some
of

diet
surveys
repeatedly

that

well
as
notes
from
my
human
nutrition
course
i
will
be
posting
a
discussion
of
vitamin
a
sometime
in
the
future
along
with
reference
citings
to
point
out
the
extremely
important
role
that
vitamin
a
plays
in
the
mucus
membrane
defense
system
in
the
body
and
why
vitamin
a
should
be
effective
in
dealing
with
candida
blooms
another
effective
dietary
treatment
is
to
restrict
carbohydrate
intake
during
the
treatment
phase
this
is
especially
important
if
the
gi
system
is
involved
if
candida
can
not
get
glucose
its
not
going
to
out
grow
the
bacteria
and
you
then
give
bacteria
which
can
use
amino
acids
and
fatty
acids
for
energy
a
chance
to
take
over
and
keep
the
candida
in
check
once
carbohydrate
is
returned
to
the
gut
if
steve
and
some
of
the
other
naysayers
want
to
jump
all
over
this
post
fine
i
jumped
all
over
steve
in
sci
med
nutrition
because
he
verbably
accosted
a
poster
who
was
seeking
advice
about
her
doctors
use
of
vitamin
a
and
antifungals
for
a
candida
bloom
in
her
gut
people
seeking
advice
from
newsnet
should
not
be
treated
this
way
those

us
giving

our
time
and
knowledge
can
slug
it
out
to
our

content
if
you
saved
your
venom
for
me
steve
and
left
the
helpless
posters
who
are
timidly
seeking

alone

my
girlfriend
is
in
pain
from
kidney
stones
she
says
that
because
she
has
no

she
cannot
get
them
removed
my
question
is
there
any
way
she
can
treat
them
herself
or
at

mitigate
their
effects
any

is
deeply
appreciated
advice
referral

thank
you
dave
carvell
first
let
me
offer
you
my
condolences
ive
had
kidney
stones
times
and
i
know
the
pain
she
is
going
through
first
it
is
best
that
she
see
a
doctor
however
every
time
i
had
kidney
stones
i
saw
my
doctor
and
the
only
thing
they
did
was
to
prescribe
some
pain
killers
and
medication
for
a
urinary
tract
infection
the
pain
killers
did
nothing
for
mekidney
stones
are
extremely
painful
my
stones
were
judged
passable
so
we
just
waited
it
out
however
the
last
one
took
days
to
passnot
fun
anyway
if
she
absolutely
wont
see
a
doctor
i
suggest
drinking
lots
of
fluids
and
perhaps
an
over
the
counter
sleeping
pill
but
i
do
highly
suggest
seeing
a
doctor
kidney
stones
are
not
something
to
fool
around
with
she
should
be
xrayed
to
make
sure
there
is
not

a
friend
has
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
minor
case
of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as
fresh
vegetables
without
discomfort
and
of
course
she
wants
to
avoid
a
recurrence
her
question
is
are
there
any
nutritionists
who
specialize
in
the
problems
of
people
with
crohns
disease
if
she
is
having
problems
with
fresh
vegetables
the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruction
of
the
intestine
without
knowing
more
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
obstruction
is
permanent
due
to
scarring
or
temporary
due
to
swelling
of
inflammed
intestine
in
general
there
are
no
dietary
limitations
in
patients
with
crohns
except
as
they
relate
to
obstruction
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
foods
will
bring
on
recurrence
of
crohns
interesting
statements
simply
because
i
have
been
told
otherwise
im
certainly
not
questioning
steves
claims
as
for
one
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
i
agree
that
foods
dont
bring
on
the
recurrence
of
crohns
but
inflammation
can
be
either
mildly
or
drastically
enhanced
due
to
food
having
had
one
major
obstruction
resulting
in
resection
is
that
a
good
enough
caveat
i
was
told
that
a
low
residue
diet
is
called
for
basically
the
idea
is
that
if
there
is
inflammation
of
the
gut
which
may
not
be
realized
by
the
patient
any
residue
in
the
system
can
be
caught
in
the
folds
of
inflammation
and
constantly
irritate
thus
exacerbating
the
problem
therefore
anything
that
doesnt
digest
completely
by
the
point
of
common
inflammation
should
be
avoided
with
what
ive
been
told
is
typical
crohns
of
the
terminal
ileum
my
diet
should
be
low
residue
consisting
of
completely
out
never
again
items
o
corn
kernel
husk
doesnt
digest
most
of
us
know
this
o
popcorn
same
o
dried
dehydrated
fruit
and
fruit
skins
o
nuts
very
tough
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
some
fudge
discouraged
greatly
o
raw
vegetables
too
fibrous
o
wheat
and
raw
grain
breads
o
exotic
lettuce
iceberg
is
ok
since
its
apparently
mostly
water
o
greens
turnip
mustard
kale
etc
o
little
seeds
like
sesame
try
getting
an
arbys
without
it
o
long
grain
and
wild
rice
husky
o
beans
youll
generate
enough
gas
alone
without
them
o
basically
anything
that
requires
heavy
digestive
processing
i
was
told
that
the
more
processed
the
food
the
better
rather
ironic
in
this
day
and
age
the
whole
point
is
preventative
you
want
to
give
your
system
as
little
chance
to
inflame
as
possible
i
was
told
that
among
the
numerous
things
that
were
heavily
discouraged
i
only
listed
a
few
to
try
the
ones
i
wanted
and
see
how
i
felt
if
its
bad
dont
do
it
again
remember
though
that
this
was
while
i
was
in
remission
for
veggies
cook
the
daylights
out
of
them
i
prefer
steaming
i
think
its
cooks
more
thoroughly
youre
mileage
may
vary
as
with
anything
else
check
with
your
doctor
dont
just
take
my

this

get
bloody
noses
nighttime

months

most

were
gone
and
they
havent

i
stopped
getting
the
shots

a
friend
has
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
minor
case
of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as
fresh
vegetables
without
discomfort
and
of
course
she
wants
to
avoid
a
recurrence
her
question
is
are
there
any
nutritionists
who
specialize
in
the
problems
of
people
with
crohns
disease
i
saw
the
suggestion
of
lipoxygnase
inhibitors
like
tea
and
turmeric
thanks
in
advance
john
eyles
all
your
friend
really
has
to
do
is
find
a
registered
dieticianrd
while
most
work
in
hospitals
and
clinics
many
major
cities
will
have
rds
who
are
in
private
practice
so
to
speak
many
physicans
will
refer
their
patients
with
crohns
disease
to
rds
for
dietary
help
if
you
can
get
your
friends
physician
to
make
a
referral
medical
insurance
should
pay
for
the
rds
services
just
like
the
services
of
a
physical
therapist
the
better
medical
insurance
plans
will
cover
this
but
even
if
your
friends
plan
doesnt
it
would
be
well
worth
the
cost
to
get
on
a
good
diet
to
control
the
intestinal
discomfort
and
help
the
intestinal
lining
heal
crohns
disease
is
an
inflammatory
disease
of
the
intestinal
lining
and
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
may
help
by
decreasing
leukotriene
formation
but
im
not
aware
of
tea
or
turmeric
containing
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
for
bad
inflammation
steroids
are
used
but
for
a
mild
case
the
side
effects
are
not
worth
the
small
benefit
gained
by
steroid
use
upjohn
is
developing
a
new
lipoxygenase
inhibitor
that
should
greatly
help
deal
with
inflammatory
diseases
but
its
not
available

better

much

help

appers
one
driving
characteristic
of
an
nt
especially
an
ntj
is
their
obvious
choleric
behavior
driver
type
a
etc
the
extreme
emotional
need
to
control
to
lead
andor
to
be
the
best
or
the
most
competent
if
they
are
also
extroverted
they
are
best
described
as
field
marshalls
this
trait
is
very
valuable
and
essential
in
our
society
we
need
people
who
want
to
lead
to
strive
to
overcome
the
elements
to
seek
and
thirst
for
knowledge
to
raise
the
level
of
competency
etc
the
great
successes
in
science
and
technology
are
in
large
part
due
to
the
vision
an
n
trait
and
scientifically
minded
approach
t
trait
of
the
nt
personality
of
course
the
other
types
and
temperaments
have
their
own
positive
contributions
as
well
however
when
the
nt
person
has
selfimage
challenges
the
darkside
of
this
personality
type
usually
comes
out
which
should
be
obvious
to
all
a
physician
who
is
a
strong
nt
and
who
has
not
learned
to
temper
their
temperament
will
be
extremely
businesslike
lack
of
empathy
or
feeling
and
is
very
compelled
to
have
total
control
over
their
patient
the
patient
must
be
obedient
to
their
diagnosis
and
prescription
without
question
ive
known
many
mds
of
this
temperament
and
suffice
to
say
i
dont
oblige
them
with
a
followup
visit
no
matter
how
competent
i
think
they
are
and
they
usually
are
very
competent
from
a
knowledge
viewpoint
since
that
is
an
extreme
drive
of
theirs
to
know
the
most
to
know
it
all
maybe
we
need
more
nf
doctors
enough
on
this
subject
lets
move
on
to
candida
bloom
let
me
tell
you
who
the
quacks
really
are
these
are
the
physicans
who
have
no
idea
how
the
human
body
interacts
with
its
environment
and
how
that
balance
can
be
altered
by
diet
and
antibiotics
could
it
just
be
professional
jealousy
i
couldnt
help
elaine
or
jon
but
somebody
else
did
youve
helped
me
already
by
your
post
of
course
i
believe
that
i
have
been
misdiagnosed
on
the
net
as
suffering
from
anal
retentivitis
but
being
the
phlegmatic
i
am
maybe
i
was
just
a
little
too
harsh
on
a
few
people
myself
in
past
posts
lets
all
try
to
raise
the
level
of
this
discussion
above
the
level
of
anal
effluent
humans
have
all
kinds
of
different
organisms
living
in
the
gi
system
mouth
stomach
small
and
large
intestine
sinuses
vagina
and
on
the
skin
these
are
nonpathogenic
because
they
do
not
cause
disease
in
people
unless
the
immune
system
is
compromised
they
are
also
called
nonpathogens
because
unlike
the
pathogenic
organisms
that
cause
human
disease
they
do
not
produce
toxins
as
they
live
out
their
merry
existence
in
and
on
our
body
but
any
of
these
organisms
will
be
considered
pathogenic
if
it
manages
to
take
up
residence
within
the
body
a
poor
mucus
membrane
barrier
can
let
this
happen
and
vitamin
a
is
mainly
responsible
for
setting
up
this
barrier
in
my
welldescribed
situation
in
prior
posts
i
definitely
was
immune
stressed
blood
tests
showed
my
vitamin
a
levels
were
very
low
my
sinuses
were
a
mess
no
doubt
the
mucosal
lining
and
the
cilia
were
heavily
damaged
i
also
was
on
antibiotics
times
in
years
in
the
end
even
two
weeks
of
ceftin
did
not
work
and
i
had
confirmed
diagnoses
of
a
chronic
bacterial
infection
of
the
sinuses
via
catscans
mucus
color
wont
get
into
the
details
and
other
symptoms
three
very
traditional
ents
made
this
diagnosis
i
did
not
have
any
cultures
done
however
because
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
this
right
and
because
my
other
symptoms
clearly
showed
a
bacterial
infection
enough
of
this
background
provided
to
help
you
understand
where
i
was
when
i
make
comments
about
my
sporanox
antifungal
therapy
below
the
first
question
i
have
is
this
can
fungus
penetrate
a
little
way
into
poor
mucus
membrane
tissue
maybe
via
hyphae
thus
causing
symptoms
without
being
considered
systemic
in
the
classic
sense
it
is
sort
of
an
inbetween
infection
steve
got
real
upset
with
elaines
doctor
because
he
was
using
antifungals
and
vitamin
a
for
her
gi
problems
if
steve
really
understoood
what
vitamin
a
does
in
the
body
he
would
notor
at
least
should
not
be
calling
elaines
doctor
a
quack
i
was
concerned
too
because
of
the
toxicity
of
vitamin
a
my
doctor
after
my
blood
tests
put
me
on
iu
of
vitamin
a
for
one
week
only
then
dropped
it
down
to
iu
for
the
next
couple
of
weeks
i
also
received
zinc
and
other
supplementation
since
all
of
these
interrelate
in
fairly
complex
ways
as
my
doctor
explained
hes
one
of
those
evil
orthomolecular
specialists
i
had
a
blood
test
three
weeks
later
and
vitamin
a
was
normal
he
then
stopped
me
on
all
vitamin
a
except
for
some
in
a
multivitamin
supplement
and
made
sure
that
i
maintain
a
iuday
of
beta
carotene
call
me
carrot
face
hopefully
elaines
doctor
will
take
a
similar
careful
approach
and
to
all
supplements
im
even
reevaluating
some
supplements
im
taking
for
example
niacin
in
fairly
large
dosages
gramday
which
steve
dyer
had
good
information
about
on
scimednutrition
if
niacin
only
has
secondorder
improvement
in
symptomatic
relief
of
my
sinus
allergies
then
it
probably
is
not
worth
taking
such
a
large
dose
longterm
and
risking
liver
damage
survives
if
it
gets
access
to
a
lot
of
glucose
it
blooms
and
over
rides
the
other
organisms
living
with
it
in
the
sinuses
gi
tract
or
vagina
in
though
i
do
now
believe
based
on
my
successful
therapy
with
sporanox
that
i
definitely
had
some
excessive
growth
of
fungus
unknown
species
in
my
sinuses
i
still
want
to
ask
the
question
have
there
been
any
studies
that
demonstrate
candida
blooms
in
the
sinuses
with
associated
sinus
irritation
sinusitisrhinitis
my
sinus
irritation
reduced
significantly
after
one
week
of
sporanox
and
no
other
new
treatments
were
implemented
during
this
time
i
did
not
have
any
noticeable
gi
track
problems
before
starting
on
sporanox
but
some
for
a
few
days
after
which
then
went
away
considered
normal
btw
my
doctor
dug
out
one
of
his
medical
reference
books
sorry
cant
remember
which
one
and
found
an
obscure
comment
dating
back
into
the
which
stated
that
people
can
develop
contained
nonlethal
or
nonserious
aspergillis
infestations
aspergiliosis
of
the
sinuses
leading
to
sinus
inflammation
symptoms
ill
have
to
dig
out
that
reference
again
since
it
is
relevant
to
this
discussion
some
people
do
really
develop
a
bad
inflammatory
process
at
the
mucus
membrane
or
skin
bloom
site
whether
this
is
an
allergic
like
reaction
to
the
candida
or
not
isnt
certain
my
doctor
tested
me
i
believe
a
rast
or
rast
similar
test
for
allergic
response
to
specificially
candida
albicans
and
i
showed
a
strong
positive
another
question
would
everybody
show
the
same
strong
positive
so
this
test
is
essentially
useless
and
assuming
it
is
true
that
candida
can
grow
partway
into
the
mucus
membrane
tissue
and
the
concentration
exceeds
a
threshold
amount
could
not
a
person
who
tests
as
having
an
allergy
to
candida
definitely
develop
allergic
symptoms
such
as
mucus
membrane
irritation
due
to
the
bodys
allergic
response
as
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
one
does
not
need
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
or
have
a
md
degree
or
a
phd
in
biochemistry
to
see
the
plausibility
of
this
hypothesis
btw
and
ill
repost
this
again
dr
ivker
in
his
book
sinus
survival
has
routinely
given
before
anything
else
nizoral
a
presporanox
systemic
antifungal
not
as
safe
and
not
as
good
as
sporanox
to
his
new
chronic
sinusitis
patients
if
they
have
been
on
antibiotics
four
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
he
claims
that
out
of
or
so
patients
well
over
notice
some
relief
of
sinus
inflammation
and
other
symptoms
but
it
doesnt
cure
it
by
any
means
implying
the
socalled
yeastfungus
infection
is
not
the
primary
cause
but
a
later
complication
hes
also
found
that
nystatin
whether
taken
internally
or
put
into
a
sinus
spray
does
not
help
this
implies
of
course
assuming
that
excessive
yeastfungus
bloom
is
aggravating
the
sinus
inflammation
that
the
yeastfungus
has
grown
partway
into
the
tissue
since
nystatin
will
not
kill
yeastfungus
other
than
by
direct
contact
it
is
not
absorbed
into
the
blood
stream
again
i
admit
lots
of
ifs
and
implies
which
doesnt
please
the
hardcore
nt
who
has
to
have
the
doubleblind
study
or
its
a
nonissue
but
one
has
to
start
with
some
plausible
hypothesisexplanation
a
strawman
if
you
will
if
its
internal
only
symptoms
can
be
used
and
these
symptoms
are
pretty
nondescript
this
brings
up
an
interesting
observation
used
by
those
who
will
deny
and
reject
any
and
all
aspects
of
the
yeast
hypothesis
until
the
appropriate
studies
are
done
and
that
is
if
you
cant
observe
or
culture
the
yeast
bloom
in
the
gut
or
sinus
then
theres
no
way
to
diagnose
or
even
recognize
the
disease
and
i
know
they
realize
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
test
for
candida
overbloom
in
any
part
of
the
body
that
cannot
be
easily
observed
since
candida
is
everywhere
in
the
body
its
a
real
another
those
who
totally
reject
the
yeast
hypothesis
say
that
no
studies
have
been
done
actually
studies
have
been
done
but
if
its
not
up
to
a
certain
standard
then
it
is
from
their
perspective
a
nonstudy
which
should
not
even
be
considered
i
agree
that
the
appropriate
studies
should
be
done
and
that
will
take
big
to
do
it
right
however
in
order
to
convince
the
funding
agencies
in
these
austere
times
to
open
their
wallets
you
literally
have
to
give
them
evidence
and
the
only
acceptable
evidence
to
compete
with
other
proposals
is
paradoxically
to
do
almost
the
exact
study
needed
funding
that
is
you
have
to
do
of
the
study
before
you
even
get
funding
as
a
scientist
at
a
national
lab
im
very
aware
of
this
for
the
smaller
funded
projects
im
afraid
that
even
if
dr
ivker
and
other
doctors
got
together
pooled
their
practices
case
histories
and
anecdotes
into
a
compelling
picture
and
approach
the
funding
agencies
they
would
get
nowhere
even
if
they
were
able
to
publish
their
statistical
results
it
is
obvious
from
the
comments
by
some
of
the
doctors
here
is
that
they
have
decided
excessive
yeast
colonization
in
the
gut
or
sinuses
leading
to
noticeable
nonlethal
symptoms
does
not
exist
and
is
not
even
a
tenable
hypothesis
so
any
amount
of
case
histories
or
compiled
anecdotal
evidence
to
the
contrary
will
never
change
their
mind
and
not
only
that
they
would
also
oppose
the
needed
studies
because
in
their
minds
its
a
done
issue
excessive
yeast
growth
leading
to
diffuse
allergic
symptoms
does
not
will
not
and
cannot
exist
period
kind
of
tough
to
dialog
with
those
who
hold
such
a
viewpoint
kind
of
reminds
me
of
lister
candida
is
kept
in
check
in
most
people
by
the
normal
bacterial
flora
in
the
sinuses
the
gi
tractmouth
stomach
and
intestines
and
in
the
vaginal
tract
which
compete
with
it
for
food
the
human
immune
system
ususally
does
not
bother
itself
with
thesenonpathogenic
organisms
unless
they
broach
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
if
they
do
an
inflammatory
response
will
be
set
up
most
americans
are
not
getting
enough
vitamin
a
from
their
diets
about
of
all
americans
die
with
less
vitamin
a
than
they
were
born
withus
autopsy
studies
while
this
low
level
of
vitamin
a
does
not
cause
pathologyblindness
it
does
impair
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
this
would
then
be
a
predisposing
factor
for
a
strong
inflammatory
response
after
a
candida
bloom
arent
there
also
other
nutrients
necessary
to
the
proper
working
of
the
sinus
mucus
membranes
and
cilia
while
diabetics
can
suffer
from
a
candida
bloom
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
bloom
is
the
use
of
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
which
knock
down
many
different
kinds
of
bacteria
in
the
body
and
remove
the
main
competition
for
candida
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
while
drugs
are
available
to
handle
candida
many
patients
find
that
their
doctor
will
not
use
them
unless
there
is
evidence
of
a
systemic
infection
the
toxicity
of
the
antifungal
drugs
does
warrant
some
caution
but
if
the
gi
or
sinus
inflammation
is
suspected
to
be
candidaand
recent
use
of
a
broad
spectrum
antibiotic
is
the
smoking
gun
then
antifungal
use
should
be
approrpriate
just
as
the
antifungal
creams
are
an
appropriate
treatment
for
recurring
vaginal
yeast
infections
in
spite
of
what
mr
steve
dyer
says
again
the
evidence
from
mycological
studies
indicate
that
many
yeastfungus
species
can
grow
hyphae
roots
into
deep
tissue
similar
to
mold
growing
in
bread
you
can
continue
to
kill
the
surface
such
as
nystatin
does
but
you
cant
kill
that
which
is
deeper
in
the
tissue
without
using
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
itraconazole
sporanox
or
some
of
the
older
ones
such
as
nizoral
which
are
more
toxic
and
not
as
effective
this
is
why
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
recent
studies
sent
to
me
by
a
doctor
ive
been
in
email
contact
with
thanks
that
nystatin
is
not
effective
in
the
long
term
treatment
of
gi
tract
candidiasis
its
like
trying
to
weed
a
garden
by
cutting
off
whats
above
the
ground
but
leaving
the
roots
ready
to
come
out
again
once
you
walk
away
the
question
is
whether
a
contained
candida
bloom
can
partially
grow
into
tissue
through
the
mucus
membranes
causing
some
types
of
symptoms
in
susceptible
people
eg
allergy
without
becoming
systemic
in
the
classical
sense
of
the
word
something
in
between
strictly
an
excessive
bloom
not
causing
any
problems
and
the
fullblown
systemic
infection
that
is
potentially
lethal
in
the
gi
system
the
anorectal
region
seems
to
be
a
particularly
good
reservoir
for
candida
and
the
use
of
pantyhose
by
many
women
creates
a
very
favorable
environment
around
the
rectum
for
transferthrough
moisture
and
humidity
of
candida
to
the
vaginal
tract
one
of
the
most
effctive
ways
to
minimmize
this
transfer
is
to
wear
undyed
cotton
underwear
also
if
one
is
an
anal
retentive
like
ive
been
diagnosed
in
a
prior
post
that
can
also
provide
more
sites
for
excessive
candida
growth
if
the
bloom
occurs
in
the
anal
area
the
burning
swelling
pain
and
even
blood
discharge
make
many
patients
think
that
they
have
hemorroids
if
the
bloom
manages
to
move
further
up
the
gi
tract
very
diffuse
symptomatology
occursabdominal
discomfort
and
blood
in
the
stool
this
positive
stool
for
occult
blood
is
what
sent
elaine
to
her
family
doctor
in
the
first
place
after
extensive
testing
he
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
but
her
gut
still
hurt
on
to
another
doctor
and
so
on
richard
kaplan
has
told
me
throiugh
email
that
he
considers
occult
blood
tests
in
stool
specimens
to
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
because
of
the
very
large
number
of
false
positivescandida
blooms
guys
if
my
gut
hurt
me
on
a
constant
basis
i
would
want
it
fixed
yes
its
nice
to
know
that
i
dont
have
colon
cancer
but
what
then
is
causing
my
distress
when
i
finally
find
a
doctor
who
treats
me
and
gets
me
better
steve
dyer
calls
him
a
quack
as
ive
said
in
private
email
there
are
flaws
in
our
current
medical
system
that
make
it
difficult
or
even
impossible
for
a
physician
to
attempt
alternative
therapies
after
the
approvedprovenaccepted
therapies
dont
work
for
example
i
went
to
three
ents
who
all
said
that
i
will
just
have
to
live
with
my
acutechronic
sinusitis
after
the
abs
failed
they
did
mention
surgery
to
open
up
the
ostia
but
my
ostia
werent
plugged
and
it
would
not
get
to
the
root
cause
of
my
condition
after
three
months
of
aggressive
and
fairly
nonstandard
therapy
sporanox
body
nutrient
level
monitoring
and
equalization
vitamin
c
lentinen
echinacea
etc
my
health
has
vastly
improved
to
where
i
was
two
years
ago
before
my
health
greatly
deteriorated
of
course
skeptics
would
say
that
maybe
if
i
did
nothing
i
would
have
improved
anyway
but
that
view
is
stretching
things
quite
far
because
of
the
experience
of
the
three
ents
i
saw
who
said
that
id
just
have
to
live
with
it
im
confident
i
will
reach
what
one
could
call
a
total
cure
the
antifungal
program
i
undertook
was
one
necessary
step
in
that
direction
because
of
my
overuse
of
abs
for
the
last
four
years
note
for
those
having
sinus
problems
may
i
suggest
the
book
by
dr
ivker
i
mention
above
be
sure
to
get
the
revised
edition
i
have
often
wondered
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinus
problems
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tells
his
patients
is
a
nonexistent
syndrome
dr
ivker
started
off
having
chronic
and
severe
sinus
problems
and
his
visits
to
several
ents
totally
floored
him
when
they
said
youll
just
have
to
live
with
it
he
spent
several
years
trying
everything
standard
and
nonstandard
until
he
was
essentially
cured
of
chronic
sinusitis
he
now
shares
his
approach
in
his
book
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
am
on
the
road
to
recovery
following
some
parts
of
it
his
one
recommendation
to
take
a
systemic
antifungal
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
if
you
have
a
history
of
antibiotic
overuse
has
been
proven
to
him
time
and
time
again
in
his
own
practice
im
sure
if
i
commented
to
him
of
the
hardcore
beliefs
of
the
anti
yeast
hypothesis
posters
that
he
would
have
definite
things
to
say
such
as
its
worked
wonders
for
me
in
almost
two
thousand
cases
to
put
it
mildly
i
also
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
would
say
that
they
are
the
ones
violating
their
moral
obligations
to
help
the
patient
maybe
those
doctors
who
are
reading
this
who
have
a
practice
and
are
confronted
by
a
patient
having
symptoms
that
could
be
due
to
the
hypothetical
yeast
overgrowth
eg
they
fit
some
of
the
profiles
the
proyeast
people
have
identified
should
consider
antifungal
therapy
if
all
other
avenues
have
been
exhausted
remember
theory
and
practice
are
two
different
things
you
cannot
have
one
without
the
other
they
are
synergistic
if
a
doctor
does
something
nonstandard
yet
produces
noticeable
symptomatic
relief
in
over
a
thousand
of
his
patients
shouldnt
you
at
least
sit
up
and
take
notice
maybe
you
ought
to
trust
what
he
says
and
begin
hypothesizing
why
it
works
instead
of
why
it
shouldnt
work
im
afraid
a
lot
of
doctors
have
become
so
enamored
with
scientific
correctness
that
they
are
ignoring
the
patients
they
have
sworn
to
help
you
have
to
do
both
both
have
to
be
balanced
which
we
dont
see
from
some
of
the
posters
to
this
group
there
comes
a
point
when
you
just
have
to
use
a
little
common
sense
and
maybe
an
empirical
approach
such
as
trying
a
good
systemic
antifungal
such
as
sporanox
after
having
exhausted
all
the
other
avenues
i
was
one
of
those
who
the
traditional
medical
establishment
was
not
able
to
help
so
i
did
the
natural
thing
i
went
to
a
couple
of
doctors
who
are
somewhat
outside
this
establishment
and
as
a
result
i
have
found
significant
relief
would
it
not
be
better
if
the
traditional
medical
establishment
can
set
up
some
kind
of
mechanism
where
any
doctor
without
fear
of
being
sued
or
having
his
license
pulled
can
try
experimental
and
unproven
beyond
a
doubt
therapies
for
hisher
patients
that
finally
reach
the
point
where
all
the
accepted
therapies
are
ineffective
id
like
to
hear
a
doctor
tell
me
well
ive
tried
all
the
therapies
that
are
approved
and
accepted
in
this
country
and
since
they
clearly
dont
work
for
you
i
now
have
the
authority
to
use
experimental
unproven
techniques
that
seem
to
have
helped
others
i
cant
promise
anything
and
there
are
some
risks
you
will
have
to
sign
something
saying
you
understand
the
experimental
and
possibly
risky
nature
of
these
unproven
therapies
and
ill
have
to
register
your
case
at
the
state
board
anyway
if
my
ent
had
suggested
this
to
me
i
wouldve
jumped
on
this
pronto
instead
of
going
to
one
of
those
doctors
who
for
either
altruistic
reasons
or
for
greed
is
practicing
these
alternative
therapies
with
much
risk
to
himher
risk
meaning
losing
their
license
and
possibly
to
the
patient
such
a
mechanism
would
keep
control
in
the
more
mainstream
medicine
and
also
provide
valuable
data
that
would
essentially
be
free
it
also
would
be
morally
and
ethically
better
than
the
current
system
by
showing
the
compassion
of
the
medical
community
to
the
patient
that
its
doing
everything
it
can
within
reason
to
help
the
patient
it
is
the
lack
of
such
a
mechanism
that
is
leading
large
numbers
of
people
to
try
alternative
therapies
some
of
which
seem
to
work
like
my
case
and
others
of
which
will
never
work
at
all
true
quackery
i
better
get
off
my
soapbox
before
this
post
reaches
in
size
if
taken
orally
it
can
also
become
a
major
bacteria
in
the
gut
through
aresol
sprays
it
has
also
been
used
to
innoculate
the
sinus
membranes
but
before
this
innoculation
occurs
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
needs
to
be
strengthened
this
is
accomplished
by
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
and
some
of
the
bcomplex
vitamins
diet
surveys
repeatedly
show
that
americans
are
not
getting
enough
and
folate
these
are
probably
the
segement
of
the
population
that
will
have
the
greatest
problem
with
this
nonexistent
disordercandida
blooms
after
antibiotic
therapy
what
dosage
of
appears
to
be
necessary
to
promote
the
healing
and
proper
working
of
the
mucos
memebranes
some
of
the
above
material
was
obtained
from
natural
healing
by
mark
bricklin
published
by
rodale
press
as
well
as
notes
from
my
human
nutrition
course
i
will
be
posting
a
discussion
of
vitamin
a
sometime
in
the
future
along
with
reference
citings
to
point
out
the
extremely
important
role
that
vitamin
a
plays
in
the
mucus
membrane
defense
system
in
the
body
and
why
vitamin
a
should
be
effective
in
dealing
with
candida
blooms
another
effective
dietary
treatment
is
to
restrict
carbohydrate
intake
during
the
treatment
phase
this
is
especially
important
if
the
gi
system
is
involved
if
candida
can
not
get
glucose
its
not
going
to
out
grow
the
bacteria
and
you
then
give
bacteria
which
can
use
amino
acids
and
fatty
acids
for
energy
a
chance
to
take
over
and
keep
the
candida
in
check
once
carbohydrate
is
returned
to
the
gut
id
like
to
see
the
role
of
complex
carbohydrates
such
as
starch
if
steve
and
some
of
the
other
naysayers
want
to
jump
all
over
this
post
fine
i
jumped
all
over
steve
in
sci
med
nutrition
because
he
verbably
accosted
a
poster
who
was
seeking
advice
about
her
doctors
use
of
vitamin
a
and
antifungals
for
a
candida
bloom
in
her
gut
people
seeking
advice
from
newsnet
should
not
be
treated
this
way
those
of
us
giving
of
our
time
and
knowledge
can
slug
it
out
to
our
hearts
content
if
you
saved
your
venom
for
me
steve
and
left
the
helpless
posters
who
are
timidly
seeking
help
alone
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
with
your
behavior
brave
soul
you
are
the
venom
on
usenet
can
be
quite
toxic
unless
one
develops
an
immunity
to
it
one
year
ago
my
phlegmatic
self
would
have
backed
down
right
away
from
an
attack
of
cholericitis
but
my
immune
system
and
my
computer
system
have
been
hardened
from
gradual
desensitization
i
now
kind
of
like
being
called
anal
retentive
it
has
a
nice
ring
to
it
i
also
was
very
impressed
by
how
it
just
flowed
into
the

truly
classic
worthy

even

i
think
anecdotal
evidence
provided
there
is
a
lot
of
it
and
it
is
fairly
consistent
will
is
very
important
first
it
points
to
the
necessity
of
doing
a
study
and
second
it
at
least
says
that
the
effects
are
all
psychological
or
possibly
allergy
in
this
case
as
ive
pointed
out
before
pyschological

are
no

real
than
other

reality
using

twisted

the

one

cannot

to
another
person
on
an
acid
trip
there
is
no
clinical
evidence
that
those
effects
are
always
going
to
happen
anyhow
that
was
a
pretty
lame
example
but
hopefully
i
made
my
point
its
all
a
matter
of
perception
and
as
long
as
someone
ingesting
msg
perceives
it
as
causing
bad
effects
then
she
can
definitely
experience
those
affects
on
the
other
hand
it
could
just
be
an
allergy
to
the
food
its
in
or
something
still
anecdotal
evidence
is
not

its
the
stuff
that
leads

from

krishnasvaxoxfordacuk
the
best
way
of
self
injection
is
to
use
the
right
size
needle
and
choose
the
correct
spot
for
streptomycin
usually
given
intra
muscularly
use
a
thin
needle
guage
and
select
a
spot
on
the
upper
outer
thigh
no
major
nerves
or
blood
vessels
there
clean
the
area
with
antiseptic
before
injection
and
after
make
sure
to
inject
deeply
a
different
kind
of
pain
is
felt
when
the
needle
enters
the
muscle
contrasted
to
the
prick
when
it
pierces
the
skin
ps
try
to
go
to
a
doctor
selftreatment
and
selfinjection
should
be
avoided
as
far
as
possible
the
areas
that
are
least
likely
to
hurt
are
where
you
have
a
little
fat
i
inject
on
my
legs
and
gut
and
prefer
the
gut
i
can
stick
it
in
at
a
degree
angle
and
barely
feel
it
im
not
fat
just
have
a
little
gut
my
legs
however
are
muscular
and
i
have
to
pinch
to
get
anything
and
then
i
inject
at
about
a
degree
angleand
it
still
hurts
the
rate
of
absorbtion
differs
for
subcutaneous
and
muscular
injections
howeverso
if
its
a
daily
thing
it
would
be
best
not
to
switch
places
every
day
to
keep
consistencey
although
some
suggest
switch
legs
or
sides
of
the
stomach
for
each
shot
to
prevent
irritation
when
you
clean
the
spot
off
with
an
alcohol
prep
wait
for
it
to
dry
somewhat
or
you
may
get
the
alcohol
in
the
puncture
and
of
course
that
doesnt
feel
good
a
way
to
prevent
irratation
is
to
mark
the
spot
that
you
injected
a
good
way
to
do
this
is
use
a
little
round
bandage
and
put
it
over
the
spot
this
helps
prevent
you
from
injecting
in
the
same
spot
and
spacing
the
sites
out
accuartely
about
apart
this
is
from
experience
so
i
hope
itll
help
you
i
have
diabetes
and
have
to
take
an
injection
every
morning
later

looked
in
the
literature
and
located
two
articles
that
implicated
corn
contains
tryptophan
and
seizures
the
idea
is
that
corn
in
the
diet
might
potentiate
an
already
existing
or
latent
seizure
disorder
not
cause
it
check
to
see
if
the
two
kellog
cereals
are
corn
based
id
be
interested
years
ago
when
i
was
an
intern
an
obese
young
woman
was
brought
into
the
er
comatose
after
having
been
reported
to
have
grand
mal
seizures
why
attending
a
corn
festival
we
pumped
her
stomach
and
obtained
what
seemed
like
a
couple
of
liters
of
corn
much
of
it
intact
kernals
after
a
few
hours
she
woke
up
and
was
fine
i
was
tempted
to
sign
her
out
as
acute
corn

hi
ive
just
returned
from
a
visit
with
my
obgyn
and
i
have
a
few
concerns
that
maybe
yall
can
help
me
with
ive
been
seeing
her
every
weeks
for
the
past
few
months
im
at
week
and
during
the
last
visits
ive
gained
to
pounds
every
weeks
she
said
this
was
unacceptable
over
any
week
period
as
it
stands
ive
thus
far
gained
pounds
also
she
says
that
though
im
at
weeks
the
babys
size
is
weeks
i
think
she
mentioned
inches
for
the
top
of
the
fundus
when
i
was
weeks
the
babys
size
was
weeks
i
must
also
add
that
i
had
an
operation
a
few
years
ago
for
endometriosis
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
endometriosis
but
apparently
it
is
causing
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
during
the
pregnancy
and
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
moving
and
the
doc
has
recommended
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
little
handicapped
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
thats
of
the
situation
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
i
was
getting
sick
throwing
up
about
times
a
day
and
mostly
it
was
bile
that
was
being
eliminated
i
told
her
about
this
i
know
this
because
i
wasnt
eating
very
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
results
well
now
i
only
get
sick
about
once
every
weeks
and
it
is
still
bile
related
but
in
addition
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usually
when
i
was
lying
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
worse
though
because
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
im
not
taking
in
fat
is
she
expecting
the
baby
will
take
it
from
my
stores
and
why
this
restriction
on
carbohydrates
if
shes
concerned
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommendation
is
based
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistatis
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
information
on
she
originally
said
that
i
should
only
gain
pounds
during
the
entire
pregnancy
since
i
was
about
lbs
overweight
when
i
started
but
my
sister
gained
lbs
during
her
pregnancy
and
shes
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
any
problems
she
also
asked
if
any
members
of
my
family
were
obese
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overly
concerned
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
being
punished
by
a
severe
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporary
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reasonable
is
this
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
since
im
trying
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
really
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assumes
i
must
be
eating
a
highfat
diet
but
really
it
is
that
because
of
the
endometriosis
and
the
operation
im
not
able
to
use
the
energy
from
the
food
i
do
eat
any
opinions
info
and
experiences
will
be
appreciated
im
truly
going
stark
raving
mad
trying
to
meet
this
new
strict
diet
because
fruits
and
vegetables
go
through
my
system
in
a
few
minutes
and
ill
end
up
having
to
eat
constantly
thus
far
i
dont
find
any
foods
satisfying

interesting
statements
simply
because
i
have
been
told
otherwise
im
certainly
not
questioning
steves
claims
as
for
one
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
i
agree
that
foods
dont
bring
on
the
recurrence
of
crohns
but
inflammation
can
be
either
mildly
or
drastically
enhanced
due
to
food
the
feeling
obout
this
has
changed
in
the
gi
community
the
current
feeling
is
that
inflammation
is
not
induced
by
food
there
is
even
evidence
that
patients
deprived
of
food
have
mucosal
atrophy
due
to
lack
of
stimulation
of
intestinal
growth
factors
there
is
now
interest
in
providing
small
amounts
of
nasogastric
feeding
to
patients
on
iv
nutrition
but
i
digress
symptoms
can
be
drastically
enhanced
by
food
but
not
inflammation
having
had
one
major
obstruction
resulting
in
resection
is
that
a
good
enough
caveat
i
was
told
that
a
low
residue
diet
is
called
for
basically
the
idea
is
that
if
there
is
inflammation
of
the
gut
which
may
not
be
realized
by
the
patient
any
residue
in
the
system
can
be
caught
in
the
folds
of
inflammation
and
constantly
irritate
thus
exacerbating
the
problem
therefore
anything
that
doesnt
digest
completely
by
the
point
of
common
inflammation
should
be
avoided
with
what
ive
been
told
is
typical
crohns
of
the
terminal
ileum
my
diet
should
be
low
residue
consisting
of
completely
out
never
again
items
o
corn
kernel
husk
doesnt
digest
most
of
us
know
this
o
popcorn
same
o
dried
dehydrated
fruit
and
fruit
skins
o
nuts
very
tough
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
some
fudge
the
low
residue
diet
is
appropriate
for
you
if
you
still
have
obstructions
again
it
is
not
felt
that
food
causes
inflammation
these
foods
are
avoided
because
they
may
get
stuck
id
go
ahead
and
have
the
fudge
though
discouraged
greatly
o
raw
vegetables
too
fibrous
o
wheat
and
raw
grain
breads
o
exotic
lettuce
iceberg
is
ok
since
its
apparently
mostly
water
o
greens
turnip
mustard
kale
etc
o
little
seeds
like
sesame
try
getting
an
arbys
without
it
o
long
grain
and
wild
rice
husky
o
beans
youll
generate
enough
gas
alone
without
them
o
basically
anything
that
requires
heavy
digestive
processing
i
was
told
that
the
more
processed
the
food
the
better
rather
ironic
in
this
day
and
age
the
whole
point
is
preventative
you
want
to
give
your
system
as
little
chance
to
inflame
as
possible
i
was
told
that
among
the
numerous
things
that
were
heavily
discouraged
i
only
listed
a
few
to
try
the
ones
i
wanted
and
see
how
i
felt
if
its
bad
dont
do
it
again
remember
though
that
this
was
while
i
was
in
remission
for
veggies
cook
the
daylights
out
of
them
i
prefer
steaming
i
think
its
cooks
more
thoroughly
youre
mileage
may
vary
as
with
anything
else
check
with
your
doctor
dont
just
take
my
word
but
this
is
the
info
ive
been
given
and
it
may
be
a
starting
point
for
discussion
good
luck
spencer
makes
an
especially
good
point
in
having
an
observant
and
informed
patient
would
that
many
patients
be
able
to
tell
what
causes
them
problems
the
digestive
processing
idea
is
changing
but
if
a
food
causes
problems
avoid
them
be
sure
that
the
foods
are
tested
a
second
time
to
be
sure
the
food
is
a
real
cause
crohns
commonly
causes
intermittent
symptoms
and
some
patients
end
up
with
severly
restricted
diets
that
take
months
to
renormalize
there
was
a
good
article
in
the
ccfa
newsletter
recently
that
discussed
the
issue
of
dietary
restriction
of
fiber
it
would
be
worth
reading
to
anyone
with
an
interest
in
crohns
and
as
i
always
say
when
dealing
with
crohns
as
does

thanks

john

all
your
friend
really
has
to
do
is
find
a
registered
dieticianrd
while
most
work
in
hospitals
and
clinics
many
major
cities
will
have
rds
who
are
in
private
practice
so
to
speak
many
physicans
will
refer
their
patients
with
crohns
disease
to
rds
for
dietary
help
if
you
can
get
your
friends
physician
to
make
a
referral
medical
insurance
should
pay
for
the
rds
services
just
like
the
services
of
a
physical
therapist
the
better
medical
insurance
plans
will
cover
this
but
even
if
your
friends
plan
doesnt
it
would
be
well
worth
the
cost
to
get
on
a
good
diet
to
control
the
intestinal
discomfort
and
help
the
intestinal
lining
heal
crohns
disease
is
an
inflammatory
disease
of
the
intestinal
lining
and
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
may
help
by
decreasing
leukotriene
formation
but
im
not
aware
of
tea
or
turmeric
containing
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
for
bad
inflammation
steroids
are
used
but
for
a
mild
case
the
side
effects
are
not
worth
the
small
benefit
gained
by
steroid
use
upjohn
is
developing
a
new
lipoxygenase
inhibitor
that
should
greatly
help
deal
with
inflammatory
diseases
but
its
not
available
yet
marty
b
be
sure
a
dietician
is
up
to
date
on
crohns
and
ulcerative

previously
low

diets
were
recommended
but
this
advice
has

changed
also
there
will
be

in

input

will

i
find
the

very
important
in
my

and
i
send
most
of
my
patients
to
a
dietician
in
the

them

first
it

it

i
decided

my

not

i
got
flamed

for
stating
that

im
going

state
it
again

the
best
way
to
prevent

this
is

have

explain

is

route
of

increasing
your

then
result
in

you
take

is

even

read
up

several

if

were

both

patients
were

a

for

if

there
was
no

that

this
seems

if
lots

are

along

then
the
ratio

could

bad
isnt

any

i
have
seen
a
fair

recently
concerning

i
am
also
interested

this

i
have
a

but
here
it
is
again
is
anyone
interested

participating
in
a

this
would
allow
us
to
hold

i
already
run

mail

are

ask

and

the

works
by

all

okay
this
is
a
long

my
friend
robin
has
recurring
bouts
of
mononucleosistype
symptoms
very
regularly
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
number
of
years
shes
seen
a
number
of
doctors
six
was
the
last
count
i
think
most
of
them
have
said
either
you
have
mono
or
youre
full
of
it
theres
nothing
wrong
with
you
one
has
admitted
to
having
no
idea
what
was
wrong
with
her
and
one
has
claimed
that
it
is
epsteinbarr
syndrome
now
what
she
told
me
about
ebs
is
that
very
few
doctors
even
believe
that
it
exists
obviously
this
has
been
her
experience
so
whats
the
story
is
it
real
does
the
medical
profession
believe
it
to
be
real
has
anyone
had
success
is
treating
ebs
or
is
it
just
something
to
live
with
thanks
for
your
assistance
outbreaks
of
a
chronicmonolike
entity
were
originally
called
ebs
or
some
variant
thereof
because
most
of
the
people
with
this
disease
had
elevated
levels
of
antibodies
to
the
ebv
virus
but
not
all
of
them
did
which
prompted
an
official
renaming
of
the
disease
to
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
this
renaming
took
place
in
the
annals
of
internal
medicine
jan
i
believe
now
its
also
called
chronic
fatigue
and
immune
dysfunction
syndrome
cfids
since
it
seems
clear
that
some
sort
of
immune
disregulation
is
causing
the
probs
astonishly
there
are
still
docs
who
tell
people
with
massively
swollen
glands
recurrent
fevers
and
nightsweats
etc
that
theres
nothing
wrong
with
them
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
syndrome
may
have
a
at
least
partly
psychological
cause
the
disagreement
among
people
whose
thoughts
are
worth
considering
centers
on
just
what
the
cause
is
no
one
knows
but
theories
include
psychological
stress
some
sort
of
virus
a
retrovirus
say
most
maybe
one
of
the
newly
discovered
herpes
viruses
environmental
toxins
bacteria
and
yes
candida
genes
andor
some
combo
of
these
theres
no
outright
cure
at
the
moment
but
different
docs
try
different
things
some
of
which
seem
to
help
massive
amounts
of
info
on
the

are
available
these

your

with

another
fungal
growth
is
an
error
of

healers
have
had
a
long
history
of
trying

relieve
human
suffering
some
have
stuck
to
standard
approved
procedures
others
have
been
willing

try
any
reasonable
treatment
if
there

the
key
has
to
be
tied

healers
oath
i
will
do
no
harm
but
you
know
david
that
very
few
treatments
involve
no
risk
to
the
patient
the
job
of
the
physician
is
a
very
difficult
one
when
risk
versus
benefit
has
to
be
weighed
each
physician
deals
with
this
riskbenefit
paradox
a
little
differently
some
are
very
conservative
while
others
are
more
agressive
an
agressive
approach
may
be
more
costly
to
the
patient
and
carry
more
risk

as

as
the
motive
is
improving

what

reserve
the
term

these
people
lurk
on
the
fringes
of
the
health

system
waiting
for
the
frustrated
patient
to
fall
into
their
lair
some
of
these
individuals
are
really
doing
a
pretty
good
job
of
providing
alternative
medicine
but
many
lack
any
formal
training
and
are
in
the
business
simply
to
make
a
few
fast
bucks
while
a
patient
can
be
reasonably
assured
of
getting
competent

call
into
question
the
true
focus
of
the
medical
profession
the
ama
and
the
boards
should
focus
on
these
quacks
instead
of
devoting
unbelievable
energy
on
searchand
destroymissions
to
pull
the
licenses
of
those
doctors
who
are
trying
non
traditional
or
not
fully
accepted
treatments
for
their
desperate
patients
that
traditionalaccepted
medicine
cannot
help
now
to
make
a
general
comment
on
many
recent
posts
lately
ive
seen
the
word
quack
bandied
about
recklessly
when
a
doctor
or
doctorwannabe
has
decided
to
quit
discussing
any
controversial
medical
subject
in
a
civilized
manner
all
heshe
has
to
do
is
say
quackquack
and
somehow
they
magically
expect
the
readership
of
this
newsgroup
to
roll
over
on
their
backs
and
peepee
on
themselves
in
obedience
what
do
they
teach
you
in
medical
school
how
to
throw
your
authority
around
let
me
put
it
another
way
to
make
my
point
clear
quack
is
a
nebulous
word
lacking
in
any
precision
its
sole
use
is
to
obfuscate
the
issues
at
hand
the
indiscriminate
use
of
this
word
is
a
sure
sign
of
incompetency
and
coming
from
any
medical
doctor
or
wannabe
where
competency
is
expected
is
real
scary
but
what
do
i
know
ive
already
been
diagnosed
by
the
scimedgods
in
this
newsgroup
as
being
anal

i
look

hey

the

on

who
refuse
to
have
an

on

treatments
and

such

should

any
information
on

to
prevent

esophagitis
the
names
of
a
doctors
who
specialize
in
such
surgery
information
on
reflux
esophagitis
which
leads
to
cancer
my
boyfriend
age
and
otherwise
in
good
health
was
diagnosed
with
reflux
esophagitis
and
a
hiatal
hernia
about
years
ago
at
that
time
he
saw
a
gastroenterologist
and
has
tried
acid
controllers
mylanta
tagamet
as
well
as
a
restricted
diet
and
raising
the
head
of
his
bed
these
treatments
were
not
effective
and
because
the
damage
was
worsening
he
opted
for
a
surgical
repair
months
ago
he
was
told
there
were
two
repair
techniques
that
could
fix
the
problem
a
nissen
wrap
and
a
hill
repair
he
opted
for
the
hill
repair
he
recovered
very
well
from
the
surgery
itself
but
the
pain
he
had
originally
is
worse
and
in
addition
he
now
has
trouble
swallowing
including
saliva
the
doctor
now
wants
to
do
an
endoscopy
and
has
also
informed
him
that
a
biopsy
might
be
necessary
if
he
has
a
precancerous
condition
which
he
called
barretts
syndrome
if
he
cant
avoid
having
reflux
will
he
necessarily
get
cancer
basically
if
anyone
has
any
information
on
what
he
should
do
now
id
appreciate
it

does
anyone
know
about
this
i
also
heard
this
i
always
thought
it
might
make
a
good
eposide
of
columbo
for
someone
to
be
poisoned
with
heavy
water
it
wouldnt
show
up
in
any
chemical
test
no
one
else
seems
to
know
so
ill
post
this
this
topic
came
up
on
sciphysicsfusion
shortly
after
the
coldfusion
flap
started
as
i
recall
its
been
done
to
some
experimental
mice
they
showed
various
ill
effects
and
eventually
died
the
reason
is
that
deuterium
does
not
have
exactly
the
same
reaction
rates
as
hydrogen
due
to
its
extra
mass
which
causes
lower
velocity
boltzman
constant
mumble
this
throws
various
bits
of
body
biochemistry
out
of
kilter
and
you
get
sick
and
die
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
being
poisened
this
way
in
or
out
of
real
life
the
process
takes
quite
a
while
if
anyone
wants
to
write
this
book
i
would
imagine
you
would
have
to
replace
a
significant
fraction
of
the
water
in
the
body
with
heavy
water
wait
while
normal
breakdown
and
repair
processes
cause
other
molecules
in
the
body
to
be
synthesised
using
the
deuterium
during
this
process
the
victim
would
gradually
deteriorate
and
eventually
die
but
i
imagine
it
would
take
weeks
during
which
the
poisoner
would
have
to
ensure
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
water
the
victim
ingested
was
heavy
you
would
get
such
a
mess
of
symptoms
that
the
doctors
would
be
both
alarmed
and
confused
why
should
every
organ
in
the
body
suddenly
begin
to
deteriorate
if
you
can
figure
out
how
the
poisoner
gets
the
heavy
water
into
the
victim
in
a
hospital
then
you
could
have
a
real
story
here
come
to
think
of
it
would
continue
even
after
the
heavy
water
was
no
longer
being
ingested
so
hospitalisation
might
be
too
late
the
most
detectable
effect
would
be
that
the
victims
body
fluids
would
literally
be
heavy
water
has
a
molecular
weight
of
and
heavy
water
has
a
mw
of
thus
the
victims
weight
will
increase
by
about
for
every
of
body
water
replaced
by
heavy
water
maybe
the
detection
occurs
because
some
pathologist
in
the
lab
notices
that
the
victims
urine
is
strangely
dense
is
there
any
medical
test
involving
the
specific
gravity
of
a
body
fluid

hi
ive
just
returned
from
a
visit
with
my
obgyn
and
i
have
a
few
concerns
that
maybe
yall
can
help
me
with
ive
been
seeing
her
every
weeks
for
the
past
few
months
im
at
week
and
during
the
last
visits
ive
gained
to
pounds
every
weeks
she
said
this
was
unacceptable
over
any
week
period
as
it
stands
ive
thus
far
gained
pounds
also
she
says
that
though
im
at
weeks
the
babys
size
is
weeks
i
think
she
mentioned
inches
for
the
top
of
the
fundus
when
i
was
weeks
the
babys
size
was
weeks
i
must
also
add
that
i
had
an
operation
a
few
years
ago
for
endometriosis
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
endometriosis
but
apparently
it
is
causing
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
during
the
pregnancy
and
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
moving
and
the
doc
has
recommended
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
little
handicapped
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
thats
of
the
situation
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
i
was
getting
sick
throwing
up
about
times
a
day
and
mostly
it
was
bile
that
was
being
eliminated
i
told
her
about
this
i
know
this
because
i
wasnt
eating
very
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
results
well
now
i
only
get
sick
about
once
every
weeks
and
it
is
still
bile
related
but
in
addition
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usually
when
i
was
lying
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
worse
though
because
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
im
not
taking
in
fat
is
she
expecting
the
baby
will
take
it
from
my
stores
and
why
this
restriction
on
carbohydrates
if
shes
concerned
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommendation
is
based
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistatis
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
information
on
she
originally
said
that
i
should
only
gain
pounds
during
the
entire
pregnancy
since
i
was
about
lbs
overweight
when
i
started
but
my
sister
gained
lbs
during
her
pregnancy
and
shes
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
any
problems
she
also
asked
if
any
members
of
my
family
were
obese
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overly
concerned
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
being
punished
by
a
severe
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporary
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reasonable
is
this
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
since
im
trying
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
really
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assumes
i
must
be
eating
a
highfat
diet
but
really
it
is
that
because
of
the
endometriosis
and
the
operation
im
not
able
to
use
the
energy
from
the
food
i
do
eat
any
opinions
info
and
experiences
will
be
appreciated
im
truly
going
stark
raving
mad
trying
to
meet
this
new
strict
diet
because
fruits
and
vegetables
go
through
my
system
in
a
few
minutes
and
ill
end
up
having
to
eat
constantly
thus
far
i
dont
find
any
foods
satisfying
thanks
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calories
up
slowly
rather
than
bread
or
corn
maybe
smaller
meals
as
you
may
be
getting
less
room
in
the
stomach
area
is
the
baby
still
coming
up
is
it
starting
to
push
or
rub
under
your
ribs
how
tight
are
your
clothes
you
shouldnt
be
wearing
any
clothing
that
compresses
your
middle
be
sure
not
to
suck
in
your
stomach
when
sitting
again
it
will
put
pressure
on
the
digestive
tract
try
laying
on
your
sides
back
and
stay
in
reclining
positions
for
the
many
hours
you
are
being
inactive
easier
on
your
legs
circulation
as
well
you
might
try
letting
the
baby
turn
or
at
least
not
be
forced
under
the
ribs
during
the
last
months
when
you
are
shortwaisted
its
easy
for
that
baby
to
end
up
right
under
the
diaphram
especially
if
you
have
tight
abdominal
muscles
if
i
had
my
second
one
to
do
over
again
i
think
id
have
tried
to
loosen
up
since
he
didnt
turn
sideways
until
late
and
the
relief
was
enormous
maybe
this
doctor
does
have
a
thing
about
weight
gain
in
pregnancy
or
maybe
she
just
nags
all
her
patients
this
way
especially
if
shes
young
but
this
gallbladderwhatever
problem
that
might
be
coming
up
is
something
to
be
avoided
if
possible
nausea
etc
can
vary
from
person
to
person
and
with
each
pregnancy
my
first
pregnancy
was
miserable
during
the
second
i
had
very
little
trouble
some
articles
have
said
that
women
with
nausea
had
a
statistically
better
chance
of
carrying
their
baby
grain
of
salt

as

about

is

enough
to

that
someone
is
not
a

or
is
it
just
that
even
if
a

is
a
quack
other
people
shouldnt
say
so
can
you
give
an
example
of
a
commonly
diagnosed
ailment
that
you
think
is
a
quack
diagnosis
or
have
we
gotten
to
the
point
in
civilization
where
we
no
longer
need
to
worry
about
unscrupulous
healers
taking
advantage
of
people
david
rind
sure
there
are
quacks
there
are
quacks
who
dont
treat
and
quacks
who
treat
ones
that
refuse
to
diagnose
and
ones
that
diagnose
improperly
there
are
lucky
quacks
and
unlucky
quacks
smart
quacks
and
dumb
ones
there
are
people
ahead
of
their
time
with
unprobable
or
unproven
theories
and
rationals
there
are
illreasoned
absurd
theorists
sometimes
its
hard
to
tell
whos
who
reading
a
book
of
ancient
jokes
it
seems
that
doctors
called
other
doctors
quacks
in
babylon
arguments
abound
when
there
arent
any
firm
answers
plenty
of
illnesses
arent
or
cant
be
diagnosed
or
treated
but
i
think
its
better
to
argue
against
the
theory
as
was
originally
done
with
postings
on
candida
a
month
or
so
ago
stating
the
facts
usually
works
better
than
simply
asserting
an
opinion
about
someones
competency
and
you
cant
convince
everybody
sometimes
a
correct
diagnosis
takes
years
for
people
they
dont
run
into
a
doctor
who
recognizes
the
disease
they
havent
developed
something
recognizable
yet
or
they
have
something
that
no
one
is
going
to
recognize
because
it
hasnt
been
described
yet
sometimes
they
get
a
cure
sometimes
the
illness
wears
out
sometimes
they
stumble
on
an
improper
diagnosis
with
the
right
treatment
sometimes
they
find
its
incurable
there
is
no
profit
in
a
patient
accepting
a
hopeless
attitude
about
an
illness
unless
its
a
rock
solid
diagnosis
of
terminal
disease
its
is
more
like
ly
that
a
person
will
find
a
cure
if
they

when

lately
ive
seen
the
word
quack
bandied
about
recklessly
actually
i
almost
never
use
the
term
quack
when
i
discuss
systemic
yeast
syndrome
however
i
always
point
out
that
mainstream
medicine
views
this
as
a
quack
diagnosis
and
i
agree
with
that
characterization
let
me
put
it
another
way
to
make
my
point
clear
quack
is
a
nebulous
word
lacking
in
any
precision
really
i
bet
virtually
everyone
reading

understands
what
steve

when

would
you
prefer

charlatan
i
dont
happen
to

all

are
charlatans
since
i
suspect
that
some
believe

are

has
an

machine
in

when
on
her
next
visit
my

asked
another
doctor
in
the
office
if
they
read
the
ultrasounds
themselves
or
if
they
had
a

read
the

the
doctor
very
vehemently
insisted
that
they
were
qualified
to
read
the

and
radiologists
were
not
my
wife
is
concerned
about
this
she
saw
a
tv
show
a
couple
months
back
something
like
or
dateline
nbc
etc
where
an
expert
on
fetal
ultrasounds
a
radiologist
was
showing
all
the
different
deffects
that
could
be
detected
using
the
ultrasound
should
my
wife
be
concerned
should
we
take
the
pictures
to
a
radiologist
for
a
second
opinion
and
if
so
where
would
we
find
such
an
expert
in
chicago
we
dont
really
have
any
special
medical
reason
to
be
concerned
but
if
a
radiologist
will
be
able
to
see
things
the
obgyn
cant
then
i
dont
see
why
we
shouldnt
use
one
any
thoughts
as
far
as
i
can
see
if
your
obstetrition
has
an
ultrasound
in
his
rooms
and
is
expirienced
its
use
and
interpretation
he
should
be
just
as
capable
of
reading
it
as
any
radiologist
all
doctors
are
qualified
to
read
xrays
us
ct
scans
etc
it
is
just
that
a
radiologist
does
nothing
else
and
thus
is
only
better
at
reading
them
because
of
all
this
time
spent
doing
this
skill
in
reading
xrays
etc
just
comes
from
plenty
of
practice
if
your
obstetrition
reads
heaps
of
obstetric
ultrasounds
he
should
be
able
to
pick
up
any

noring
and
the
fellow
from

sorry
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggested
one
set
of
anecdotal
evidence
in
favor
based
on
their
personal
experiences
namely
that
when
people
with
certain
conditions
are
given
antifungals
many
of
them
appear
to
get
better
so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
please
there
is
no
point
in
yelling
back
and
forth
at
each
other
any
longer
since
neither
side
has
any
convincing
evidence
either
positive
or
negative
and
i
understand
that
your
abject
disbelief
is
based
on
the
existence
of
people
who
may
get
famous
or
make
money
applying
the
diagnosis
to
everything
in
sight
making
wild
claims
with
no
evidence
and
always
refusing
to
do
controlled
studies
but
that
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
apparently
sincere
experiences
of
the
people
on
the
net
observing
antifungals
working
on
themselves
and
other
people
in
certain
specific
cases
there
are
also
quacks
who
sell
oral
superoxide
dismutase
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
completely
broken
down
in
the
guts
but
this
doesnt
change
the
genuine
scientific
knowledge
about
the
role
of
superoxide
dismutase
in
fighting
oxidative
damage
same
thing
just
cause
there
are
candida
quacks
that
doesnt
establish
evidence
against
the
candida
hypothesis
if
theres
some
other
reason
besides
the
quacks
if
only
anecdotal
to
think
it
could
be
true
then
that
is
what
has
to
be
considered
that
is
what
the
net
people
have
been
talking
about
but
again
there
is
no
point
in
arguing
about
it
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
and
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
and
there
are
also
some
candida
quacks
out
there
i
hope
everyone
can
agree
on
all
of
that
thus
it
appears
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
proponents
can
marshall
enough
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
convincing
and
documented
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carrying
out
a
good
controlled
doubleblind
study
of
antifungals
or
else
forget
convincing
anybody
else
to
carry
out
the
test
just
carry
it
out
themselves
and
also
whether
they
can
adequately
define
the
patient
population
or
symptoms
on
which
such
a
study
should
be
carried
out

provide

shed
been

for
the
hyperthyroidism
for
many
years

apparently
started

it
i
understand
that
she
may
still
be
testing
high
in
thyroid
level
but
shes
isnt

were
women
and
children
the
people
had
come
out
for
a
rare
day
of
sunshine
and
the
children
were
playing
soccer
there
was
no
warning
the
blood
flowed
like
a
river
in
the
street
he
said
there
were
pieces
of
women
all
around
and
you
could
not
piece
them
together
one
woman
holding
her
two
children
in
her
hands
was
lying
with
them
on
the
ground
dead
they
had
no
heads
before
mujanovic
arrived
with
his
supplies
conditions
were
deplorable
he
said
many
deaths
could
have
been
prevented
had
the
hospital
had
surgical
tools
facilities
and
medicine
the
six
general
practitioners
who
had
been
operating
before
he
arrived
had
even
less
surgical
experience
than
he
did
they
didnt
know
the
basic
principles
for
amputating
limbs
once
he
arrived
the
situation
improved
he
said
but
by
midseptember
he
had
run
out
of
supplies
bandages
were
washed
and
boiled
five
times
sometimes
they
were
falling
apart
in
my
hands
he
said
doctors
had
no
anesthetic
and
could
not
give
patients
alcohol
to
numb
the
pain
because
it
increased
bleeding
people
were
completely
conscious
during
amputations
and
stomach
operations
he
said
blood
transfusions
were
impossible
because
they
had
no
facilities
to
test
blood
types
i
felt
destroyed
psychologically
mujanovic
said
the
situation
improved
after
dec
when
a
convoy
arrived
from
the
belgian
medical
group
medecins
sans
frontieres
but
mujanovic
said
the
military
predicament
worsened
in
middecember
after
bosnian
serbs
began
a
major
offensive
in
the
region
every
day
we
had
air
strikes
and
shellings
then
the
hunger
set
in
between
middecember
and
midmarch
when
us
planes
began
air
dropping
food
between
and
people
were
dying
every
day
from
complications
associated
with
malnutrition
he
said
i
know
for
sure
that
the
air
drop
operation
saved
the
people
from
massive
death
by
hunger
and
starvation
he
said
according
to
mujanovic
around
people
died
in
srebrenica
of
them
children
during
a
year
of
siege
mujanovic
plans
to
return
to
srebrenica
in
three
weeks
after
visiting
his
wife
who
is
ill
in
tuzla
they
say
im
a
hero
he
said
there
were
thousands
of
people
standing
at
the
sides
of
the
road
crying
and
waving
when
i
left
and

i

one

i
can
understand
the
skepticism
of
those
who
see
this
associated
with
various
general
kinds
of
symptoms
while
there
is
a
lack
of
solid
demonstration
that
this
happens
and
causes
such
general

to
understand
this
skepticism
one
only
needs
to
know
of
past
failures
that
shared
these

with
the
notion
of

there
have
been
quite
a
few
and
the

of
all
thought
that
the
skeptics
were
overly
skeptical
on
the
other
hand
i
am
happy
to
read
that
some

are
sufficiently
interested
in
this
possibility
spurred
by
suggestive
clinical

it
further
the

how

let

put
it
another
way
to

my

clear
quack

a
nebulous
word
lacking
in
any
precision
its
sole
use
is
to
obfuscate
the
issues
at

funny
i
thought
it
meant
one
who
fraudulently
misrepresents
his
ability

experience
in
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
disease
or
the
effects
to
be
achieved
by
the
treatment
he
offers
dorlands
certainly
more
precision
than
conveyed
by
chronic
yeast
the
indiscriminate
use
of
this
word
is
a
sure
sign
of
incompetency
and
coming
from
any
medical
doctor
or
wannabe
where
competency
is
expected
is
real
scary
the
inability
to
discriminate
between
fraudulent
or
erroneous
representations
is
far
more
frightening
it
is
fraud
to
promote
a
treatment
where
the
evidence
for
it
is
either
lacking
or
against
it
and
the
quacksalver
knows
so
or
error
if
the
honest
practitioner
doesnt
know
so
failure
to
speak
out
against
either
bespeaks
incompetency
ps
may
i

seriously

the

the

from

sorry
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggested
one
set
of
anecdotal
evidence
in
favor
based
on
their
personal
experiences
namely
that
when
people
with
certain
conditions
are
given
antifungals
many
of
them
appear
to
get
better
gee
i
have
many
interesting
and
enlightening
anecdotes
about
myself
my
friends
and
my
family
but
in
the
practice
of
medicine
i
expect
and
demand
more
rigorous
rationales
for
basing
therapy
than
aunt
susies
brotherinlaw
anecdotal
evidence
may
provide
inspiration
for
a
hypothesis
but
rarely
proves
anything
in
a
positive
sense
and
unlike
mathematics
boolean
logic
rarely
applies
directly
to
medical
issues
and
so
evidence
of
exceptions
does
not
usually
disprove
but
rather
modifies
current
concepts
of
disease
so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
please
there
is
no
point
in
yelling
back
and
forth
at
each
other
any
longer
since
neither
side
has
any
convincing
evidence
either
positive
or
negative
i
would
characterize
it
not
as
abject
disbelief
but
rather
scientific
outrage
over
vastly
overstated
conclusions
it
appears
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
proponents
can
marshall
enough
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
convincing
and
documented
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carrying
out
a
good
controlled
doubleblind
study
of
antifungals
or
else
forget
convincing
anybody
else
to
carry
out
the
test
just
carry
it
out
themselves
and
also
whether
they
can
adequately
define
the
patient
population
or
symptoms
on
which
such
a
study
should
be
carried
out
to
provide
a
fair
test
of
the
hypothesis
i
have
no
problem
with
such
an
approach

this
is
not

last

was

after
having
some
difficulties
with
walking
and
writing
she
is
years
old
otherwise
she
is
in

health
the
discovery
was
made
via
cat
scans
she
then
had
mri
scans
done
where
small
cancerous
areas
were
discovered
in
her
lungs
biopsies
showed
it
to
be
adenocarcinoma
one
spot
is
in
the
lungs
and
another
in
the
pneumothorax
the
oncologists
believe
the
cancer
started
in
the
lungs
and
caused
the
brain
tumor
she
smoked
until
four
years
ago
anyway
id
like
feedback
as
to
what
adenocarcinoma
is
how
it
is
different
from
other
cancers
how
she
will
be
treated
luckily
the
tumor
is
right
below
the
skull
and
can
be
easily
removed
and
statistically
what
are
the
chances
for
full

i

that
when

i

my

stone
and
the
pain
in

got

however
if

ate
sauerkraut

something
to

the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able

eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low

doc
wants
me
to

this
means
no
meat

fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this

no

fried
food
cheese

i
am

sweet

bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
nonfat
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
first
even
fish
fowl
and
breads
have
fat
second
the
body
will
make
fat
out
of
carbohydrates
if
it
needs
them
third
your
body
like
most
peoples
wasnt
bred
to
live
on
a
high
fat
modern
diet
if
you
read
texts
about
ancient
and
primative
people
you
will
read
about
the
luxury
of
eating
fat
how
people
enjoyed
it
this
was
because
it
was
so
rare
even
cows
didnt
put
out
nearly
the
amount
of
butterfat
in
milk
that
they
do
now
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calories
up
slowly
rather
than
bread
or
corn
maybe
smaller
meals
as
you
may
be
getting
less
room
in
the
stomach
area
is
the
baby
still
coming
up
is
it
starting
to
push
or
rub
under
your
ribs
how
tight
are
your
clothes
you
shouldnt
be
wearing
any
clothing
that
compresses
your
middle
be
sure
not
to
suck
in
your
stomach
when
sitting
again
it
will
put
pressure
on
the
digestive
tract
try
laying
on
your
sides
back
and
stay
in
reclining
positions
for
the
many
hours
you
are
being
inactive
easier
on
your
legs
circulation
as
well
you
might
try
letting
the
baby
turn
or
at
least
not
be
forced
under
the
ribs
during
the
last
months
when
you
are
shortwaisted
its
easy
for
that
baby
to
end
up
right
under
the
diaphram
especially
if
you
have
tight
abdominal
muscles
if
i
had
my
second
one
to
do
over
again
i
think
id
have
tried
to
loosen
up
since
he
didnt
turn
sideways
until
late
and
the
relief
was
enormous
maybe
this
doctor
does
have
a
thing
about
weight
gain
in
pregnancy
or
maybe
she
just
nags
all
her
patients
this
way
especially
if
shes
young
but
this
gallbladderwhatever
problem
that
might
be
coming
up
is
something
to
be
avoided
if
possible
you
dont
want
to
become
ill
with
it
while
you
are
pregnant
if
you
are
lucky
you
can
work
on
getting
rid
of
it
after
the
baby
it
is
said
that
doctors
have
less
gallbadder
surgery
than
the
rest
of
the
population
a
good
part
of
it
is
that
they
are
willing
to
do
the
dieting
etc
that
helps
them
avoid
surgery
also
i
dont
think
the
surgery
lets
a
person
go
back
to
eating
a
high
fat
diet
nausea
etc
can
vary
from
person
to
person
and
with
each
pregnancy
my
first
pregnancy
was
miserable
during
the
second
i
had
very
little
trouble
some
articles
have
said
that
women
with
nausea
had
a
statistically
better
chance
of
carrying
their
baby

salt

you

like

ad

if

is
really
the
problem
we
should
call
this
barbecue
potato
chip
syndrome
or
maybe
diner
syndrome
or
the

other
natural

syndrome
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
bought
anything
labelled
with
and
other
natural
flavorings
from
kiranvillagecom
kiran
wagle
the
reaction
came
the
time
the
msg
was
in
the
food
that
was
the
only
difference
same
restaurant
same
ingredients
how
do
you
know
this
in
order
to
demonstrate
your
claim
you
would
have
had
to
supervise
the
preparation
on
both
occasions
perhaps
they
used
msg
both
times
and
lied
about
it
perhaps
once
they
used
something
that
had
begun
to
spoil
and
produced
some
bizarre
toxin
that
youre
allergic
to
well
i
had
had
similar
reactions
many
times
that
was
when
i
really
started
watching
carefully
reaction
to
doritos
hey
guess
whats
in
there
reaction
to
lawrys
season
salt
guess
whats
in
there
ill
give
you
a
hint
ive
had
enough
problems
with
many
many
many
different
products
with
msg
that
i
figured
out
one
thing
unless
i
plan
on
getting
sick
i
wont
eat
the
stuff
without
my
seldane
and
did
i
ever
learn
to
read
labels
please
note
that
i
am
not
saying
you
are
making
it
up
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
that
the
situation
is
not
always
as
simple
as
it
might
seem
which
was
why
i
started
checking
every
time
i
got
sick
and
every
time
i
got
sick
msg
was
somehow
involved
in
one
of
the
food
products
and
consider
there
were
no
other
similar
ingredients
to
my
knowledge
it
might
not
please
a
medical
researcher
but
it
pleased
my
own
personal
physician
enough
for
him
to
give
me
allergy
medicine
and
most
importantly
its
enough
proof
for
me
to
avoid
it
and
enough
proof
that
my
incredibly
frugal
fiance
didnt
flinch
when
i
literally
threw
out
or
gave
away
all
the
food
products
in
his
pantry
that
had
msg
and
he
always
flinches
when
theres
waste
but
it
was
a
simple
explanation
i
wont
eat
this
stuff
i
wont
cook
with
this
stuff
so
i
can
either
throw
it
out
or
give
it
away
from
patteeucsucoloradoedu
donna
pattee
my
guess
was
that
the
spice
mix
on
the
fries
contained
msg
probably
lawrys
seasoning
salt
i
love
the
way
that
tastes
im
not
saying
i
never
consume
anything
with
msg
ive
noticed
that
i
have
a
certain
tolerance
level
like
a
small
bag
of
bbq
chips
once
a
month
or
so
it
not
a
problem
but
that
same
bag
of
chips
will
bother
me
if
i
also
had
chicken
bouillon
yesterday
and
lunch
at
one
of
the
chinese
restaurants
the
day
before
from
kelleyhealthyuwaterlooca
catherine
l
kelley
all
thats
needed
now
is
that
final
step
a
doubleblind
study
done
on
humans
there
isnt
even
an
ethical
question
about
possible
harm
as
this
is
a
widely
used
and
approved
food
additive
but
some
say
that
only
of
the
population
has
a
problem
with
msg
some
say
its
more
like
but
lets
say
that
its
how
many
people
would
have
to
be
tested
that
would
have
a
problem
also
i
know
i
have
a
problem
with
it
and
i
wouldnt
volunteer
for
a
test
like
thanks
guys
but
i
dont
want
to
get
sick
also
im
sure
that
most
people
probably
have
varying
degrees
of
sensitivities
at
different
times
if
i
have
a
cold
im
much
more
susceptible
to
the
reaction
than
when
im
healthy
as
proven
today
when
im
stuffy
but
for
some
silly
reason
i
still
gave
in
and
decided
to
have
the
bbq
chips
from
kiranvillagecom
kiran

too
many
of

generic

you
complain

i
suggested

cathy
doesnt
i
havent

but
i
never
called

and
i
never
stated
i
got
it
only
from
chinese

i
just
thought
it
would
be
easiest
to
conduct
my
personal
test
at
a
chinese
take
out
place
that
i
knew
would
hold
or
not
hold
the

i
cant
call
up
whoever
makes
doritos

ask
them
to
make
me
one
back
of
chips
without
msg
on
the
other
hand
if
one
complains
about
potatoes
from
a
mix
or
restaurant
spice
mixes
im
going
to
believe
them
and
if
anyone
says
they
got
msgsick
after
eating
too
many
barbecue
potato
chips
at
a

im
really
going

i
would

ive
had
the

can
tell

a

uses

annual
inguinal
hernia
repair
last
year
i
was
totally
surprised
when
my
annual
physical
disclosed
an
inguinal
hernia
i
couldnt
remember
doing
anything
that
would
have
caused
it
that
is
i
hadnt
been
lifting
more
than
other
people
do
and
in
fact
probably
somewhat
less
eventually
the
thing
became
more
painful
and
i
had
the
repair
operation
this
year
i
developed
a
pain
on
the
other
side
this
turned
out
to
be
another
inguinal
hernia
so
i
go
back
to
the
hospital
monday
for
another
fun
operation
i
dont
know
of
anything
im
doing
to
cause
this
to
happen
im
years
old
and
i
dont
think
im
old
enough
for
things
to
start
falling
apart
like
this
the
surgeon
who
is
doing
the
operation
seems
to
suspect
a
congenital
weakness
but
if
so
why
did
it
suddenly
appear
when
i
was
and
not
really
as
active
as
i
was
when
i
was
younger
does
anyone
know
how
to
prevent
a
hernia
other
than
not
lifting
anything
its
rare
that
i
lift
more
than
my
or
a
sack
full
of
groceries
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
your
typical
grocery
sack
is
fairly
small
these
days
is
there
some
sort
of
exercise
that
will
reduce
the

tribune

on
a

scale
a
recent
poll
about
doctors
earnings
is
right
up
there
it
almost
scored
a
perfect
braindead
it
was
commissioned
by
some
whiny
consumers
group
called
families
usa
the
poll
tells
us
that
the
majority
of
americans
believe
that
doctors
make
too
much
money
the
pollsters
also
asked
what
a
fair
income
would
be
for
physicians
those
polled
said
oh
about
a
year
would
be
ok
how
generous
how
sporting
how
stupid
why
is
this
poll
stupid
because
it
is
based
on
resentment
and
envy
two
emotions
that
ran
hot
during
the
political
campaign
and
are
still
simmering
you
could
conduct
the
same
kind
of
poll
about
any
group
that
earns
and
get
the
same
results
since
the
majority
of
americans
dont
make
those
bucks
they
assume
that
those
who
do
are
stealing
it
from
them
maybe
the
berlin
wall
came
down
but
dont
kid
yourself
karl
marx

its
also
stupid
because
it
didnt
ask
key
questions
such
as
do
you
know
how
much
education
and
training
it
takes
to
become
a
physician
if
those
polled
said
no
they
didnt
know
then
they
should
have
been
disqualified
if
they
gave
the
wrong
answers
they
should
have
been
dropped
what
good
are
their
views
on
how
much
a
doctor
should
earn
if
they
dont
know
what
it
takes
to
become
a
doctor
or
maybe
a
question
should
have
been
phrased
this
way
how
much
should
a
person
earn
if
he
or
she
must
a
get
excellent
grades
and
a
fine
educational
foundation
in
high
school
in
order
to
b
be
accepted
by
a
good
college
and
spend
four
years
taking
courses
heavy
in
math
physics
chemistry
and
other
lab
work
and
maintain
a
average
or
better
and
c
spend
four
more
years
of
grinding
study
in
medical
school
with
the
third
and
fourth
years
in
clinical
training
working

hours

on
your
specialty
and
f
maybe
wind
up
in

after
medical
school
and
g
then
work
an
average
of
hours
a
week
with
many
family
doctors
putting
in
hours
or
more
until
they
retire
or
fall
over
as
you
have
probably
guessed
by
now
i
have
considerably
more
respect
for
doctors
than
does
the
law
firm
of
clinton
and
clinton
and
all
the
lawyers
and
insurance
executives
they
have
called
together
to
remake
americas
health
care
based
on
what
doctors
contribute
to
society
they
are
far
more
useful
than
the
powerhappy

social
tinkerers
who
will
probably
give
us
a
medical
plan
that
is
to
health
what
clintons
first
budget
is
to
frugality
but
propaganda
works
and
as
the
stupid
poll
indicates
many
americans
wrongly
believe
that

doctors
are
the
major
cause
of
high
medical
costs

are

ah
that
is
not
something
you
heard
president
clinton
or
super
spouse
talk
about
during
the
campaign
or
since
but
instead
of
trying
to
turn
the
medical
profession
into
a
villain
they
might
have
been
more
honest
if
they
had
said
let
us
talk
about
medical
care
and
one
of
the
biggest
problems
we
have
that
problem
is
you
my
fellow
american
yes
you
eating
too
much
and
eating
the
wrong
foods
many
of
you
guzzling
too
much
hooch
still
puffing
away
at
a
pack
getting
your
daily
exercise
by
lumbering
from
the
fridge
to
the
microwave
to
the
couch
doing
dope
and
bringing
crack
babies
into
the
world
filling
the
big
city
emergency
rooms
with
gunshot
victims
engaging
in
unsafe
sex
and
catching
a
deadly
disease
while
blaming
the
world
for
not
finding
an
instant
cure
you
and
your
habits
not
the
doctors
are
the
single
biggest
health
problem
in
this
country
if
anything
it
is
amazing
that
the
docs
keep
you
alive
as
long
as
they
do
in
fact
i
dont
understand
how
they
can
stand
looking
at
your
blubbery
bods
all
day
so
as
your
president
i
call
upon
you
to
stop
whining
and
start
living
cleanly
now
i
must
go
get
myself
a
triple
cheesy
greasy
with
double
fries
do
as
i
say
not
as
i
do
but
for
those
who
truly
believe
that
doctors
are
overpaid
there
is
another
solution
dont
use
them
thats
right
you
dont
feel
well
then
try
one
of
those
spine
poppers
needle
twirlers
or
have
rev
bubba
lay
his
hands
upon
your
head
and
declare
you
fit
or
there
is
the
doityourself
approach
you
have
chest
pains
then
sit
in
front
of
a
mirror
make
a
slit
here
a
slit
there
and
pop
in
a
couple

youre
going
to
have
a
kid
why
throw
your
money
at
that
overpaid
sawbones
so
he
can
buy
a
better
car
and
a
bigger
house
than
you
will
ever
have
while
paying
more
in
taxes
and
malpractice
insurance
than
you
will
ever
earn
just
have
the
kid
the
oldfashioned
way
squat
and
do
it
and
if
it
survives
you
can
go
to
the

find

that
right
you
might

in

who
uses
sublingual

instead
of
shots
for
treatment
you
are
given
a

drops
are
placed
under

my

was
neutralized
this

process
i
had
to
return
to
the

every

for
retesting
and
a
new
bottle
of
antigens
after
the
allergy
was
completely
neutralized
a
bottle
of
maintenance
antigens
lasts
me
about
months
the
sublingual
drops
are
then
taken
times
per
week
and
costs
so
the
cost
is
less
than

it
is
more

anesthetic

i
can

is

drug
and
according

the

handbook
it
is

useful

agitation

the
original

did

why
his

had
been
in

but
i
can
answer
a
few
general
points
elderly
patients
may
exhibit
a
marked
difficulty
in
coping
after
being
in
hospital
for
a
few
days
the
drastic
change
of
environment
will
often
unmask
how
marginally
they
have
been
coping
at
home
even
young
people
find
the
change
unsettling
though
we
have
thought
that
this
decrement
in
function
after
say
anaesthesia
and
surgery
for
a
fractured
hip
a
common
event
in
the
elderly
was
due
to
anaesthesia
there
is
good
evidence
that
the
change
of
situation
is
much
more
important
some
hospitals
have
tried
a
rapid
transit
system
for
hip
fractures
aiming
to
have
the
patient
back
at
home
within
hours
of
admission
the
selection
of
the
anaesthetic
has
no
effect
on
the
ability
to
discharge
these
patients
early
anaesthetists
who
work
with
the
elderly
which
is
almost
all
of
us
generally
take
care
to
tailor
the
choice
and
dose
of
drugs
used
to
the
individual
patient
even
so
there
is
some
evidence
that
full
mental
recovery
may
take
a
surprisingly
long
time
to
return
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
is
detected
by
setting
quite
difficult
tasks

the
gross
change

the

disavow
subject
re
use
of
haldol
in
elderly
ive
seen
people
in
their
forties
and
fifties
become
disoriented
and
demented
during
hospital
stays
in
the
examples
ive
seen
drugs
were
definitely
involved
my
own
father
turned
into
a
vegetable
for
a
short
time
while
in
the
hospital
he
was
fiftythree
at
the
time
and
he
was
on
separate
medications
the
family
protested
but
the
doctors
were
adamant
telling
us
that
none
of
the
drugs
interact
they
even
took
the
attitude
that
if
he
was
disoriented
they
should
put
him
on
something
else
as
well
with
the
help
of
an
md
friend
of
the
family
we
had
all
his
medication
discontinued
he
had
a
seizure
that
night
and
was
put
back
on
one
drug
two
days
later
he
was
his
old
self
again
i
guess
there
arent
many
medical
texts
that
address
the
subject
of
interactions
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
cheap
shot
at
the
medical
profession
it
is
an
aspect
of
hospitals
that
is
very
frightening
to
me
docs
seem
to
believe
that
because
they
have
close
control
of
you
its
quite
all
right
to
take
your
bodily
equilibria
into
their
own
hands
that
control
reduces
the
chance
that
the
patient
will
make
a
mistake
but
health
care
providers
can
make
mistakes
too
and
mistakes
can
be
deadly
under
those
circumstances
i
grant
you
that
sometimes
theres
no
choice
nevertheless
i
suggest
you
procure
a
list
of
the
drugs
your
grandmother
is
getting
and
discuss
it
with
an
independent
doc
her
problems
may
not
be
the
effect
of
haldol
at
all
haldol
may
have
been
used
validly
or
it
may
have
been
prescribed
because
other
medication
confused
her
and
because
the

normally
prescribes

no
wonder
he
became
confused
with
so
many
drugs
it
is
almost
impossible
to
know
which
one
is
causing
the
problem
and
because
some
drugs
potentiate
the
effect
of
each
other
they
can
make
the
side
effects
all
the
worse
and
even
dangerous
kinda
like
mixing
alcohol
and
antihistamines
he
was
disoriened
the
doctors
thougt
they
should
put
him
on
something
else
as
well
unfortunately
doctors
prescribe
drugs
to
treat
the
side
effects
of
the
drugs
a
patient
is
receiving
if
one
drug
they
are
taking
causes
the

blood
pressure
to
go
up
many
times
an
antihypertensive
is
prescribed
instead
of
reevaluating
the
need
for
the
original
drug
this
is
why
many
older
adults
are
trying
to
take
a
dozen
or
so
drugs
at
home
procure
a
list
of
the

your

i
fully

in

she
proably
should
be
examined
by
another

who
can
reevaluate
the

she
is
taking
i
cant
remember
the
guidelines
i
either
saw
in

text
or
heard
during
a

but
any
elderly
adult
who
is
receiving
medications
should
have
the
need
for
the
drug
reevaluated
regularly
if
her
current
physician
is
unwilling
to
do
this
find
one
who
will
either
check
the

for

editorial
note
the
cesarean
rate
in
the
united
states
steadily
increased
from
through
however
the
findings
in
this
report
indicate
that
rates
have
been
stable
since
because
there
is
little
evidence
that
maternal
and
child
health
status
has
improved
during
this
time
and
because
cesareans
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
complications
of
childbirth
a
national
health
objective
for
the
year
is
to
reduce
the
overall
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
and
the
primary
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
objective
postpartum
complications
including
urinary
tract
and
wound
infections
may
account
in
part
for
the
longer
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
than
for
vaginal
births
moreover
the
prolonged
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
substantially
increase
healthcare
costs
for
example
in
the
average
costs
for
cesarean
and
vaginal
deliveries
were
and
respectively
the
additional
cost
for
each
cesarean
delivery
includes
for
physician
fees
and
for
hospital
charges
if
the
cesarean
rate
in
had
been
the
year
objective
instead
of
the
number
of
cesarean
births
would
have
decreased
by
versus
resulting
in
a
savings
of
more
than
billion
in
physician
fees
and
hospital
charges
despite
the
steady
increase
in
vbac
rates
since
several
factors
may
impede
progress
toward
the
year
national
health
objectives
for
cesarean
delivery
for
example
vbac
rates
substantially
reflect
the
number
of
women
offered
trial
of
labor
which
has
been
increasingly
encouraged
since
of
women
who
are
offered
a
trial
of
labor
could
deliver
vaginally
a
level
already
achieved
by
many
hospitals
trial
of
labor
was
routinely
offered
in
of
hospitals
surveyed
in
the
most
recent

for

on
all
women
who
had
a
prior
cesarean
regardless
of
whether
a
trial
of
labor
was
attempted
to
reach
the
overall
cesarean
rate
goal
however
increases
in
the
vbac
rate
will
need
to
be
combined
with
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
primary
rate
one
hospital
succeeded
in
reducing
the
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
by
applying
objective
criteria
for
the
four
most
common
indications
for
cesarean
delivery
by
requiring
a
second
opinion
and
by
instituting
a
peerreview
process
other
recommendations
for
decreasing
cesarean
delivery
rates
include
eliminating
incentives
for
physicians
and
hospitals
by
equalizing
reimbursement
for
vaginal
and
cesarean
deliveries
public
dissemination
of
physician
and
hospitalspecific
cesarean

rates
to
increase
public
awareness
of

editorial
note
in
uganda
the
increase
in
malaria
among
us
personnel
was
attributed
to
poor
adherence
to
both
recommended
malaria
chemoprophylaxis
regimens
and
use
of
personal
protection
measures
during
a
period
of
increased
malaria
transmission
and
intensified
chloroquine
resistance
in
subsaharan
africa
the
findings
in
this
report
underscore
the
need
to
provide
initial
and
continued
counseling
regarding
malaria
prevention
for
persons
living
abroad
in
malariaendemic
areas
preventive
measures
that
are
also
important
for
shortterm
travelers
to
such
areas
mefloquine
is
an
effective
prophylaxis
regimen
in
africa
and
in
most
other
areas
with
chloroquineresistant
p
falciparum
however
in
some
areas
eg
thailand
resistance
to
mefloquine
may
limit
its
effectiveness
in
africa
the
efficacy
of
mefloquine
compared
with
chloroquine
alone
in
preventing
infection
with
p
falciparum
is
mefloquine
is
safe
and
well
tolerated
when
given
at
mg
per
week
over
a
period
the
risk
for
serious
adverse
reactions
possibly
associated
with
mefloquine
prophylaxis
eg
psychosis
and
convulsions
is
low
ie
episodes
per
users
while
the
risk
for
less
severe
adverse
reactions
eg
dizziness
gastrointestinal
complaints
and
sleep
disturbances
is
similar
to
that
for
other
antimalarial
chemoprophylactics
doxycycline
has
similar
prophylactic
efficacy
to
mefloquine
but
the
need
for
daily
dosing
may
reduce
compliance
with
and
effectiveness
of
this
regimen
chloroquine
alone
is
not
effective
as
prophylaxis
in
areas
of
intense
chloroquine
resistance
eg
southeast
asia
and
africa
in
africa
for
persons
who
cannot
take
mefloquine
or
doxycycline
chloroquine
and
proguanil
is
an
alternative
although
less
effective
regimen
chloroquine
should
be
used
for
malaria
prevention
in
areas
only
where

conference
speakers
described
transmission
issues
and
the
hivinhibitory
activity
of
saliva
the
strength
of
which
varies
among
the

salivary
secretions
whole
saliva
has
a
greater
inhibitory
effect
than
submandibular
secretions
which
in
turn
have
a
greater
inhibitory
effect
than
parotid
secretions
research
has
shown
that
at
least
two
mechanisms
are
responsible
for
salivary
inhibitory
activity
they
attributed
the
hivinhibitory
effect
of
saliva
to
the
aggregationagglutination
of
hiv
by
saliva
which
may
both
promote
clearance
of

prevent
it
reaching

the

today
announced
that
it

publish
new

to
shed
the

of

for
patients
with
serious
or
life
threatening
illnesses
such
as
aids
cancer
and
alzheimers

these
final
rules
will
help
patients
who
are
suffering
the
most
serious
illnesses
to
get
access
to
new

months
or
even
years
earlier
than

otherwise
be
possible
said
hhs
secretary
louis

sullivan

the
effort
to
accelerate
fda
review
for
these
drugs
has
been
a
longterm
commitment
and
indeed
a
hallmark
of
this
administration
these
rules
establish
procedures
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
approve
a
drug
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
or
markers
they
apply
when
the
drug
provides
a
meaningful
benefit
over
currently
available
therapies
such
endpoints
would
include
laboratory
tests
or
physical
signs
that
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
a
clinical
effect
but
that
are
judged
by
qualified
scientists
to
be
likely
to
correspond
to
real
benefits
to
the
patient
use
of
surrogate
endpoints
for
measurement
of
drug
efficacy
permits
approval
earlier
than
if
traditional
endpoints
such
as
relief
of
disease
symptoms
or
prevention
of
disability
and
death
from
the
disease
are
used
the
new
rules
provide
for
therapies
to
be
approved
as
soon
as
safety
and
effectiveness
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
can
be
reasonably
established
the
drugs
sponsor
will
be
required
to
agree
to
continue
or
conduct
postmarketing
human
studies
to
confirm
that
the
drugs
effect
on
the
surrogate
endpoint
is
an
indicator
of
its
clinical
effectiveness

effective
for
the
treatment
of

can
be

before

the

in

the
increase
in
hdl
carries
broad
dietary
implications
for
industrialized

we
think
hdlcholesterol
increased
because
we
increased
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
over
the
fat
content
used
in
the
previous
tarahumara
metabolic
study
in
that

we
saw
no
change
in

levels
after
raising
the
dietary

but
keeping
the
fat
relatively
consistent
with
native
consumption
in
the
present
study
we
increased
fat
intake
to
percent
of
the
total
calories
we
reached
the
conclusion
in
the
tarahumara
study
that
hdl
reflects
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
in
general
and
not
the
amount
of
dietary
cholesterol
hdl
must
increase
to
help
metabolize
the
fat
and
it
increased
quite
a
bit
in
this
study
dr
connor
explains
low
hdl
in
the
tarahumarans
is
not
typically
an
important
predictor
of
coronary
heart
disease
because
they
do
not
normally
consume
large
amounts
of
fat
or
cholesterol
hdl
remains
an
important
predictor
to
americans
because
of
their
usual
high
fat
intake
dr
connor
recommends
a
diet
for
americans
that
contains
less
than
percent
of
total
calories
as
fat
less
than
mg
of
cholesterol
and
a
csi
around
varying
in

comments
on
recent
suggestions
that
americans
adopt
a
mediterraneanstyle
diet
the
original
mediterranean
diet
in
its
pristine
state
consisted
of
a
very
low
intake
of
fat
and
very
few
animal
and
dairy
products
we
are
already
eating
a
lot
of
meat
and
dairy
products
simply
to
continue
that
pattern
while
switching
to
olive
oil
is
not
going
to
help
the
situation
the
world
health
organization
who
is
focusing
much
attention
on
the
emergence
of
diseases
such
as
coronary
heart
disease
in
nations
and
societies
undergoing
technological
development
dr
connor
says
that
coronary
heart
disease
starts
with
a
given
societys
elite
who
typically
eat
a
different
diet
than
the
average
citizen
if
the
pattern
of
afluence
increases
the
entire
population
will
have
have
a
higher
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
which
places
a
termendous
health
care
burden
on
a
society
who
would
like
the
developing
countries
to
prevent
coronary
heart
disease
so
they
can
concentrate
on
other
aspects
of
their
economic
development
and
on
public
health
measures
to
improve
general
wellbeing
rather
than
paying
for
unnecessary
expensive
medical
technology
dr
connors
says
the
overall
implication
of
this
study
is
that
humans
can
readily
move
their
plasma
lipids
and
lipoprotein
values
into
a
highrisk
range
within
a
very
short
time
by
an
affluent
excessive
diet
the
present
rate
of
coronary
heart
disease
in
the
united

is
percent
less
than
it
was

a

arranged
the
collaboration
he
said
that
cooperation
between

seemed
increasingly
significant
as
it
had
become
clear
that
combinations
of
drugs
were
likely
to
be
more
effective
in
fighting
hiv
than
any
drug
used
alone
the
researchers
are
hopeful
that
hiv
when
faced
with
a
combination
of
several
drugs
requiring
mutation
at
different
sites
for
resistance
to
develop
will
be
unable
to
evolve
all
the
mutations
at
the

time
therefore
several
drugs
taken
together
or
one
after
the
other
could
halt
the

do

azt
has
been
used
in
the

asymptomatic
hivpositive
people
on
the
basis
that
administration
of
the
drug
appeared
to
abate

counts
however
a
report
in

demonstrated
that
azt
should
not
be
used
early
in
the
course
of
disease
while
the
counts
of
the
people
given
azt
were
consistently
greater
than
those
of
patients
receiving
only
placebo
the
first
three
years
of
followup
have
shown
that
the
proportions
of
people
in
the
two
groups
progressing
to
overt
aids
or
even
to
death
were
not
significantly
different
at
roughly
percent
the
conclusions
are
that
azt
is
not
an
effective
aids
drug
in
hivinfected
individuals
and
that
cell
count
may
not
be
a
reliable
proxy
for
the
progression
to
aids
in
infected
people
but
nothing
is
implied
by
the
study
of
the
utility
of
azt
in
the
treatment
of
those
in
whom
symptoms
have
already
appearedthere
is
no
case
for
abandoning
that
treatment
at
least
on
the
evidence
now
available
it
is
much
more

that
the

proven
to
be

there
another

a
a
robert

i
tried
to
email
you
but
our
board
is
having

problems
so
im
not
sure
whether
you
got
the
information
on
rutin
or
not
rutin
is
not
a
herb
but
part
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
you
should
generally
not
take
rutin
by
itself
but
take
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
if
you
dont
and
there
are
some
exceptions
to
that
youll
eventually
create
a
hesperidin
deficiency
which
is
the
other
major
component
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
i
found
out
the
hard
way
years
ago
when
i
recommended
rutin
after
it
showed
deficient
in
patients
who
were
not
deficient
in
hesperidin
be
fore
a
later
retest
almost
always
showed
a
subsequent
deficiency
in
hesperidin
which
from
then
on
made
me
always
add
bioflavonoids
to
anyone
that
had
very
low
levels
of
rutin
most
of
the
time
people
are
equally
low
in
rutin
and
hesperidin
so
there
is
really
no
reason
to
take
rutin
by
itself
but
use
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
i
have
several
thousand
patients
taking
them
with
many
claiming
that
they
had
been

hemorrhoids
varicose
veins
chronic
nose

aneurysms

one
patient
in
desperation
took
a
whole
bottle
in

day
for
his
painful
bleeding
hemorrhoids
without
any
ill
effects
they
are
also
nontoxic
in
very
high
amounts
thats
why
they
can
be
safely
recommended
if
you
are
allergic

they

they

of

taste
they
are
big

they
dont
taste

great
a

will
basically
only
tone
the
thighs
or
if
fat
from

such

would
be

there
are
two
different

here
toning

exercises
specific

will

exercised

look
at
differences

circumferences
between
pitching

nonpitching
arms
in
major

pitchers
however
if
exercise
also
leads
to
reduction
of
body
fat
the
loss
of
body
fat
will
be
equally
distributed
over
the
entire

there
is
no
way
to
spot
reduce
body
fat
other
than
surgically
through
liposuction
distribution
of
body
fat
is
genetically
determined
sometimes
a
very
flabby
muscle
will
look
like
fat
so
when
that
muscle
gains
some
muscle
tone
it
may
appear
as
though
the
fat
is
changing
into
muscle
but
really
fat
and

are

my

she
mentioned
once
about
the

she
said
that
if

my
previous
reply
on
this
topic
which
it
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
might
have
been
dangerously
misleading
in
two
spots
i
stated
that
psychotherapy
meaning
talking
therapy
and
so
on
was
used
to
treat
obsessive
compulsive
disorder
which
though
sometimes
true
is
misleading
it
is
not
often
found
effective
particularly
by
itself
primary
treatment
today
usually
consists
at
least
in
part
of
drug
therapy
the
most
current
theories
of
this
condition
attribute
it
to
more
to
biological
causes
than
psychological
in
places
where
this
distinction
becomes
important
i
mentioned
that
the
dsmiiir
mentions
impulses
as
a
possible
diagnostic
marker
however
this
might
look
like
something
people
associate
with
psychotic
conditions
uncontrollable
or
unpredictable
behaviors
which
is
not
the
case
with
ocd
one
of
the
diagnostic
criteria
of
ocd
is
that
the
individual
can
and
does
suppress
some
of
their
impulses
although
they
are
an
unending
source
of
anxiety
the
obsessive
thoughts
and
ritualistic
actions
usually
associated
with
ocd
are
most
frequently
very
mundane
and
predictable
closer
to
a
superstitious
nature

recently
learned
about

in

simply
by

the
principle
underlying
these
devices
is
a
well
establish
principle
in
psychology
called
entrainment
whereby
external
sensory
stimuli
influence
gross
electrical
patterns
of
brain
function
they
are
experimental
in
that
people
experiment
with
them
and
they
are
not
widely
if
at
all
used
in
medicine
for
therapeutic
purposes
given
the
exception
of
tens
and
similar
units
used
for
external
electrical
stimulation
usually
for
pain
relief
not
really
a

machine
they
are
not
experimental
in
the
sense
of
a
specific
medical
category
to
that
effect
as
with
experimental
drugs
as
the
fda
does
not
specifically
regulate
medical
devices
in
the
way
it
does
pharmaceuticals
i
would
think
that
if
they
work
as
reported
they
would
be
incredibly
useful
there
are
few
reliable
studies
of

other
than
those
relaxationrelated
effects
found
with
meditation
or
selfhypnosis
as
well
reported
benefits
are
mostly
anecdotal
and
subjective
so
far
so
its
hard
to
generalize
about
their
potential
value

pretty
good

on

could
they
be

are
they
just
another

a

question
might

whether

of

the

in

spending
quite
a

of

that

was

a
physician
who
continued

antifungals
are

question
seems

is
it
reasonable
to
use
them

patients
with
gi

sinus
problems
that
could
be
due
to
candida
blooms
following
the
use

antibiotics
gorden
rubenfeld
through
email
has
assured
me
that
most
physicians
recognize
the
chance
of
candida
blooms
occuring
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
and
they
therefore
reinnoculate
their
patients
with
good
bacteria
to
restore
competetion
for
candida
in
the
body
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
yet
a
standard
part
of
medical
practice
he
deals
with
critical
care
patients
where
fungal
infectionsystemic
is
a
real
problem
and
just
because
he
tries
to
keep
good
bacteria
in
his
patients
does
not
mean
that
all
physicians
do
this
i
think
that
aspergillis
is
more
likely
to
be
found
in
the
sinus
mucus
membranes
than
is
candida
women
have
been
known
for
a
very
long
time
to
suffer
from
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
and
a
women
is
lucky
to
find
a
physician
who
is
willing
to
treat
the
cause
and
not
give

her
advise
to
use
the
otc
antifungal

since
candida
colonizes
primarily
in

gi
symptoms
should
be
more
common
than
vaginal
problems
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
the
problem
we
have
here
david
is
proof
that
gi
discomfort
can
be
caused
by
a
candida
bloom
the
arguement
is
that
without

no
action
is
warrented
medicine
has
not
and
probalby
never
will

this
way
there
has

once

through
the

we
now
know
that

wisdom
was

increasing
calcium
intake
is
better
at
preventing
stone
formation
than
is

the

there
was

it
wasnt

also
when
i
asked
the

if
they
had

she
made
a
point
of
telling
me
that
i
couldnt
buy

find
the

that

down
from

am
currently
using
some
old

behind
the
ear
aids
which
keep
me
roughly
functional
but
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
recently
i
had
an
opportunity
to
test
the
widex
behind
the
ear
aids
for
several
weeks
these
have
four
independent
programs
which
are
intended
to
be
customized
for
different
hearing
situations
and
can
be
reprogramed
i
found
them
to
be
a
definite
improvement
over
my
current
aids
and
was
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
another
local
outfit
advertised
a
free
trial
of
another
programmable
system
called
resound
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
try
the
resound
aids
in
their
office
for
about
minutes
and
i
couldnt
compare
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
was
able
to
read
about
the
theory
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separate
posting
they
also
carry
the
widex
aids
and
had
one
patient
presumably
wealthy
who
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchased
the
widex
only
months
ago
the
problem
is
that
the
resound
aids
are
about
twice
as
expensive
as
the
widex
and
other
programmable
aids
i
could
take
a
trip
to

resound
hearing
aid
theory
as
i
understand
it
the
following
is
based
on
copies
i
was
given
of
some
articles
published
in
hearing
instruments
i
would
appreciate
any
comments
about
this
and
other
new
technology
for
hearing
aids
the
resound
system
was
developed
on
the
basis
of
some
research
at
att
and
appears
to
take
a
different
approach
from
other
aids
it
appears
to
me
that
a
new
programmable
aid
like
the
widex
just
uses
a
more
flexible
and
programmable
version
of
the
classical
approach
of
amplifying
some
parts
of
the
spectrum
more
than
others
and
adding
some
compression
to
try
and
help
out
in
noisy
situations
the
major
difference
in
the
resound
approach
is
that
it
divides
the
spectrum
into
low
and
high
frequencies
splitting
point
is
programmable
apparently
based
on
the
fact
that
lots
of
vowel
information
can
be
found
in
the
low
frequencies
while
the
important
consonant
information
unfortunately
for
me
is
in
the
high
frequencies
the
two
bands
then
are
treated
with
different
compression
schemes
which
are
programable
they
have
also
developed
a
new
fitting
algorythm
that
builds
on
what
they
call
abnormal
growth
of
loudness
this
latter
is
interesting
and
fits
my
own
personal
experience
though
i
think
the
phrase
is
missleading
what
appears
to
be
the
case
is
that
as
you
exceed
the
minimum
threshold
for
a
person
with
hearing
loss
the
deficit
becomes
progresslively
less
compared
to
normals
and
by
the
time
you
reach
the
too
loud
point
the
sensitivity
curves
appear
to
converge
this
means
that
if
you
just
boost
all
sound
levels
you
are
overloading
at
the
high
end
for
people
with
hearing
losses
hence
what
you
want
is
progressively
less
amplification
as
the
signal
get
closer
to
the
maximum
tolerable
point
you
want
to
boost
low
volume
sounds
more
than
high
and
do
so
potentially
differently
for
the
low
and
high
frequency
parts
of
the
spectrum
specially
for
someone
like
me
who
is
relatively
normal
up
to
cps
and
then
falls
off
a
cliff
aids
with
simple
compressors
dont
descriminate
between
energy
in
the
low
and
high
frequencies
and
can
therefor
compress
useful
high
frequency
information
because
of
high
volume
of
low
frequency
components
particularly
impressive

the

however
it
is
not
part
of
my
routine
practice
to
reinnoculate
patients
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotics
i
have
seen
no
data
on
this
practice
preventing
or
treating
fungal
infections
in
at
risk
patients
whether
or
not
it
is
a
logical
extension
from
the
available
observations
ill
leave
to
those
of
you
who
base
strong
opinions
and
argue
over
such
speculations
in
the
absence
of
clinical
trials
one
place
such
therapy
has
been
described
is
in
treating
particularly
recalcitrant
cases
of
c
difficile
colitis
not
a
fungal
infection
there
are

of

dont
try

at

not

advise
to
use
the

since
candida
colonizes
primarily
in
the
anorectal
area
gi
symptoms
should
be
more
common
than
vaginal
problems
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
except
that
it
isnt
at
least
symptomatically
apparent
disease
medicine
has
not
and
probalby
never
will
be
practiced
this
way
there
has
always
been
the
use
of
conventional
wisdom
a
very
good
example
is
kidney
stones
conventional
wisdombecause
clinical
trails
have
not
been
done
to
come
up
with
an
effective
prevention
was
that
restricitng
the
intake
of
calcium
and
oxalates
was
the
best
way
to
prevent
kidney
stones
from
forming
clinical
trials
focused
on
drugs
or
ultrasonic
blasts
to
breakdown
the
stone
once
it
formed
through
the
recent
new
england
j
of
medicine
article
we
now
know
that
conventional
wisdom
was
wrong
increasing
calcium
intake
is
better
at
preventing
stone
formation
than
is
restricting
calcium
intake
seems
like
this
is
an
excellent
argument
for
ignoring
anecdotal
conventional
wisdom
a
euphemism
for
no
data
and
doing
a
good
clinical
trial
like

the

but
nystatin
did
not
reduce
the
systemic

significantly
more
than

conclusions
in
women
with
presumed
candidiasis
hypersensitivity
syndrome
nystatin
does
not
reduce
systemic
or
psychological
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
consequently
the
empirical
recommendation
of
longterm
nystatin
therapy
for
such
women
appears
to
be
unwarranted
does
this
trial
address
every
issue
raised

no
jon

at
this
negative
trial
since
they
didnt

maybe
they
didnt
avoid
those
carbohydrates
the
conventional
wisdom
in
animal
husbandry
has
been
that
animals
need
to
be
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
coming
off
antibiotic
therapy
if
it
makes
sense
for
livestock
why
doesnt
it
make

it
be
prevented
by
a

change
this
question
came
up
in
sci
med
nutrition
and
im
posting
my
answer
here
only
medical
schools
in
the
us
teach
courses
on
human
nutrition
we
have
already
seen
what
a
lack
of
nutrition
education
can
do
when
candida
and
kidney
stones
present
themselves
to
the
medical
community
i
think
that
the
best
example
of
where
us
medicine
is
really
missing
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
a
knowledge
of
nutrition
is
pms
so
many
womenand
their
husbands
suffer
from
this
disorder
that
it
is
really
criminal
that
most
physicians
in
the
us
are
not
taught
that
pms
is
primarily
caused
by
diet
and
diet
changes
can
prevent
it
from
ever
happpening
before
shooting
your
flames
read
the
entire
article
and
then
decide
if
flaming
is
justified
from
a
poster
in
sci
medi
nutrition
in
a
psychological
anthropology
course
i
am
taking
we
got
sidetracked
onto
a
short
conversation
about
pms
some
rumors
shared
by
several
of
the
students
included
ideas
that
vitamin
levels
sugar
intake
and
caffeine
intake
might
affect
pms
symptoms
is
there
any
data
on
this
or
is
it
just
so
much
hooey

are
numerous
observational

that
have
been

in

literature

also
suggest
that
pms
is
primarily
a
disorder
that
arises
out
of
a
hormone
imbalance
that
is
dietary
in
nature
but
since
observational
studies
are
considered
by
most
physicians
in
sci

to
be
anecdotal
in
nature
i
have
not
bothered
to
cite
them
there
are
also
over
a
half
dozen
good
experimental
studies
that
have
been
done

pms
ive
chosen
the
best
specific
studies
on
individual
vitamins
and
minerals
to
try
to
point
out
that
pms
is
primarily
a
nutritional
disorder

doctors
dont
recognize

far
as
i
could

just
plain
need
more

i
am

theophylline

took
a

mg
ephedrine
mg
theophylline
i
gather
that
both

now
im

does
that

they

would
it

certainly
it

they

it

gordon

the

this
just
isnt
what
the
systemic

syndrome
is
about
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the

there
is
some

attempts
to
reinoculate
the
gi

after

dont
seem
to

yogurt
contains
lactobacillus
acidophilus
and
l
bulgaricus
l
acidophilus
is
the
major
bacteria
in
the
vaginal
tract
and
is
primarily
responsible
for
keeping
the
vaginal
tract
acidic
and
yeast
free
most
of
the
commercial
yogurt
sold
in

has
a
very
low
l

l

count
neither
of
these

are

anaerobes
with
are
much
more
important
in
dealing
with
the

problem
gordon
r
has
told
me
through

that
he
gives
his
patients
l
acidophilus
and
several
different
obligate
anaerobeswhich
setup
shop
in
the
colon
but
he
hasnt
told
me
which
ones
yet
the
lactobacillus
genera
are
mostly
facultative
anaerobes
and
will
setup
shop
where
they
have
access
to
oxygen
if
given
a

anus
sinus
cavity
and
vagina
having
these
good
bacteria
around
will
greatly
decrease
the
chance
of
candida
blooms
in
the
anal
region
or
the
vagina
i
have
not
proposed
a
systemic
action
for
candida

i
know
that
others
swear
that
all
kinds

symptoms
arise
from
the
evil
yeast
blooms
in

im
not

to
buy
that
yet
i
do
believe
that
complications
at
specific
sitesvagina
anal
and
maybe
lower
colon
sinus
and
mouth
can
result
from
antibiotic
use
which
removes
the
competing
bacteria
from
these
sites
and
thus
lets
candida
grow
unchecked
restoring
the
right
bacterial
balance
is
the
best
wayin
my
opinion
to
get
rid
of
the
problem
antifungals
a
low
carbohydrate
diet
and
vitamin
a
supplementation
may
all
help
to
minimize
the
local
irritation
until
the
good
bacteria
can
take
over
control
of
the
food
supply
again
and
lower
the

basically
starve

recognize

they
therefore
reinnoculate
their

what

that

factor
for

is
not
the

as
saying

prevent

marty
made
this
sound
like
a

also
use

associated

that
may
be
in

due

alterations

however
it
is
not

of
my
routine

to
reinnoculate

i
have
seen
no
data
on
this

preventing

treating

in

whether
or
not
it
is
a
logical

from
the

ill

those
of

over
such
speculations
in
the

clinical

have

up

that
restricitng

was

best

to

breakdown
the

once

through

j

we
now
know
that

increasing

is
better
at
preventing

than
is
restricting

seems
like
this
is
an
excellent
argument
for
ignoring

conventional

conclusions
in

nystatin

consequently
the
empirical

gordon
i
think
that
the

for

blooms
would
involve
giving
women
with
chronic

candida
blooms
l
acidophilus
orally
and
see
it
it
can
decrease
the
frequency
and
extent
of
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
since
most
of
the
candida
seems
to
be
migrating
in
from
the
anal
region
and
l
acidophilus
should
be
able
keep
the
candida
in
check
if
it
can
make
it
through
the
intestinal
tract
and
colonize
in
the
anus
where
it
will
have
access
to
oxygenjust
like
it
does
in
the
vagina
as
much
stuff
as
there
is
in
the
lay
press
about
l
acidophilus
and
vaginal
yeast
infections

really
amazed
that
someone
has
not

it
out
the

first
is
a

the
help
they
need
because
workers
are
overworked
some
clients
are
not

the
adequate
amount
of

such
conditions
may
cause
clients
to
become
more
frustrated
the
quality
of
the
clients
is
also
becoming
more
violent
as
more
are
moved
out
of

we
cant
seem
to

in
on
a

a

or
a
hypothesis
under

im
lost
point
im
beginning
to
see
that
part
of
the
disagreements
about
the
whole
yeast
issue
is
on
differing
perceptions
and
on
differing
meanings
of
words
medical
doctors
have
a
very
specific
and
specialized
jargon
necessary
for
precise
communication
within
their
field
which
im
fully
cognizant
of
since
i
too
speak
jargonese
when
with
my
peers
for
the
situation
in
scimed
many
times
the
words
or
phrases
used
by
doctors
can
have
a
different
and
more
specific
meaning
than
the
same
word
used
in
the
world
at
large
causing
significant
miscommunication
one
example
word
and
very
relevant
to
the
yeast
discussion
is
the
exact
meaning
of
systemic
it
is
now
obvious
to
me
that
the
meaning
of
this
word
is
very
specific
much
more
so
than
its
meaning
to
a
nondoctor
there
is
also
the
observation
of
this
newsgroup
that
both
doctors
and
nondoctors
come
together
on
essentially
equal
terms
which
when
combined
with
the
jargon
issue
can
further
fan
the
flames
this
is
probably
the
first
time
that
practicing
doctors
get
really
beat
up
by
nondoctors
for
their
views
on
medicine
which
they
otherwise
dont
see
much
of
in
their
practice
except
for
the
occasional
difficult
patient
point
i
understand
the
viewpoint
among
many
practicing
doctors
that
they
will
not
prescribe
any
treatmentstherapies
for
their
patients
unless
such
treatments
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
and
the
risks
understood
from
wellconstructed
clinical
trials
usually
doubleblind
or
that
such
treatmentstherapies
are
part
of
an
approved
and
funded
clinical
trial
to
these
doctors
to
do
any
differently
would
in
this
belief
system
be
unethical
practice
and
it
follows
that
any
therapy
not
on
the
accepted
list
is
therefore
a
non
therapy
it
does
not
even
exist
nor
does
the
underlying
hypothesis
or
theory
have
any
validity
even
if
it
sounds
very
plausible
by
extrapolation
of
what
is
currently
known
anecdotal
evidence
has
no
value
either
from
a
treatment
pointofview
and
by
and
large
as
a
scientist
myself
i
am
glad
that
medical
practice
science
takes
such
a
rigorous
approach
to
medical
treatment
however
as
also
being
a
human
being
last
i
checked
and
having
been
one
of
those
people
that
has
been
significantly
helped
by
a
currently
unaccepted
treatment
where
standard
medicine
was
not
able
to
help
me
has
caused
me
to
sit
back
and
wonder
if
holding
such
an
extreme
and
rigid
scientific
viewpoint
is
in
itself
unethical
from
humanitarian
considerations
after
all
the
underlying
intent
of
the
scientific
approach
to
medicine
is
to
protect
the
health
of
the
patient
by
providing
the
best
possible
care
for
the
patient
so
the
patient
should
come
first
when
considering
treatment
what
we
need
is
a
slightly
modified
approach
to
treatment
that
satisfies
both
the
scientific
and
the
humanitarian
viewpoints
in
an
earlier
post
i
outlined
a
crazy
idea
for
doing
just
that
the
gist
of
it
was
to
give
any
physician
freedom
and
encouragement
by
the
medical
community
to
prescribe
alternate
not
yet
proven
therapies
maybe
supported
by
anecdotal
evidence
for
patients
who
all
avenues
of
accepted
therapies
have
been
exhausted
and
not
until
then
the
patient
would
be
fully
informed
that
such
therapiestreatments
are
not
supported
by
the
proper
clinical
trials
and
that
there
are
real
potential
risks
with
real
possibilities
of
no
benefit
derived
from
them
this
approach
satisfies
the
need
for
scientific
rigor
it
also
satisfies
the
humanitarian
needs
of
the
patient
and
the
reality
is
that
many
patients
who
have
reached
a
deadend
in
the
treatment
of
their
symptoms
using
accepted
medicine
will
go
outside
the
orthodox
medical
community
either
to
the
doctors
who
are
brave
enough
to
prescribe
such
treatments
at
the
risk
of
losing
their
license
or
worse
to
nondoctors
who
have
not
had
the
proper
medical
training
this
approach
also
recognizes
this
reality
and
keeps
the
control
more
within
orthodox
medicine
with
the
benefits
that
the
information
gleaned
could
help
focus
limited
resources
towards
future
clinical
trials
in
the
most
productive
way
everybody
wins
in
this
admittedly
rosecolored
approach
im
sure
there
are
real
problems
with
this
approach
as
well
it
is
presented
more
as
a
strawman
to
stimulate
discussion
hopefully
what
i
write
here
may
give
the
scimed
doctors
a
better
idea
as
to
why
i
am
open
to
alternative
therapies
as
well
as
why
i
have
real
difficulty
read
apparent
hostility
with
the
coldness
of
the
pure
scientific
approach
to
medicine
i
believe
the
best
approach
to
medical
treatment
is
one
where
both
the
humanitarian
aspects
are
balanced
with
and
by
the
scientific
aspects

to

this
is
an
issue
that
has
been
coming
and
we
do
have
a
responsibility
to
deal
with
it
said
dr
ruth
berkelman
deputy
director
of
the
cdcs
national
center
for
infectious
diseases
there
were
more
cases
of
malaria
in
the
us
in
than
in
any
year
since
the
and
latin
america
is
experiencing
a
cholera
epidemic
the
first
in
this
century
she
said
resistance
of
diseasecausing
agents
to
antibiotics
is
also
a
problem
we
are
seeing
much
more
antibiotic
resistance
than
we
have
in
the
past
berkleman
said
she
said
even
common
ear
infections
frequently
seen
in
children
are
becoming
resistant
to
antibiotic
treatment
despite
predictions
earlier
this
century
that
infectious
diseases
would
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
public
health
problem
infectious
diseases
remain
the
major
cause
of
death
worldwide
and
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
united
states
the
cdc
said
it
cited
the
emergence
since
the
of
a
myriad
of
newly
identified
pathogens
and
syndromes
such
as
escherichia
coli
a
deadly
bacterial
infection
the

hiv
the

a
federal

decision
holding
a

liable
for
not
doing
enough
to
protect
workers
from
lyme

is
getting

attention
as
the

medical
study
on
the
disease
a
flulike
illness
that
can
cause
severe
physical
and
mental
disabilities
and
in
rare
instances
death
the
decision
last
week
has
put
property
owners
on
notice
that
they
may
have
to
do
more
than
protect
themselves
from
the
ticksthey
also
may
have
to
protect
themselves
from
litigation
if
someone
becomes
infected
while
on
the
property
the
decision
by
us
district
judge
robert
j
ward
in
new
york
came
after
a
weeklong
trial
in
a
case
involving
four
track
workers
for
the
long
island
railroad
judge
ward
found
that
the
workers
contracted
the
disease
after
they
were
bitten
by
ticks
while
on
the
job
he
ordered
the
new
york
stateowned
commuter
line
to
pay
the
workers
more
than
to
compensate
for
pain
and
suffering
in
addition
to
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages
summer
camps
schools
companies
with
facilities
in
rural
or
semirural
areas
and
homeowners
who
rent
to
vacationers
are
among
the
groups
that
need
to
be
worried
about
this
ruling
says
stephen
l
kass
an
attorney
at

law
firm
berle
kass
case
who
wrote
a
legal
article
three
years
ago
warning
property
owners
of
the
potential
liability
even
a
family
that
invites
friends
over
for
a
backyard
barbecue
might
be
potentially
liable
lawsuits
for
insect
bites
while
rare
arent
unheardof
a
summer
vacationer
in
southampton
ny
last
year
sued
the
owner
of
the
home
she
rented
claiming
that
a
tick
on
the
property
gave
her
rocky
mountain
spotted
fever
in
also
on
long
island
a
jury
ordered
an
outdoor
restaurant
to
pay
more
than
million
to
a
patron
who
was
stung
by
a
bee
causing
an
allergic
reaction
and
permanent
quadriplegia
the
judge
later
threw
out
the
award
citing
no
evidence
that
a
beehive
was
near
the
restaurant
but
lawyers
say
that
the
attention
to
lyme
disease
throughout
the
country
its
most
prevalent
in
new
england
the
middle
atlantic
states
wisconsin
minnesota
and
the
northwest
may
make
this
particular
insect
bite
a
particularly
litigious
one
the
illness
already
has
proved
to
be
a
source
of
controversy
in
the
courtroom
over
such
issues
as
the
type
of
medical
care
insurers
will
cover
and
medical
malpractice
claims
against
doctors
for
not
diagnosing
the
disease
lawyers
say
workerscompensation
claims
related
to
lyme
disease
have
become
common
in
some
states
in
recent
years
payments
in
workerscompensation
cases
however
are
limited
to
medical
costs
and
lost
earnings
the
case
before
judge
ward
dealt
with
a
potentially
much
more
lucrative
avenue
for
damages
because
it
involved
the
question
of
negligence
unlike
the
workers
compensation
process
the
law
governing
injuries
to
rail
workers
allows
for
a
finding
of
negligence
and
as
a
result
for
additional
payments
for
pain
and
suffering
property
owners
and
lawyers
say
that
negligence
claims
can
be
made
in
many
other
situations
where
people
are
exposed
to
the
ticks
that
carry
the
disease
ira
m
maurer
a
partner
at
new
york
law
firm
elkind
flynn
maurer
who
represented
the
rail
workers
says
the
decision
will
help
to
establish
the
duty
of
all
sorts
of
property
owners
to
protect
against
lyme
disease
lawyers
caution
that
despite
judge
wards
decision
winning
a
lawsuit
for
damages
caused
by
lyme
disease
may
prove
difficult
for
one
thing
victims
have
to
demonstrate
that
they
have
pinned
down
when
and
where
they
got
the
tick
bite
judge
ward
found
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
railroad
case
got
lyme
disease
while
working
on
property
owned
by
the
railroad
even
though
none
of
the
men
remembered
being
bitten
the
workers
who
werent
outdoorsmen
likely
to
be
exposed
elsewhere
to
the
insects
said
they
saw
ticks
in
the
high
grass
that
surrounded
some
work
sites
a
spokeswoman
for
the
railroad
says
that
there
was
no
proof
that
the
four
men
were
bitten
while
on
the
job
and
that
the
railroad
is
considering
an
appeal
the
railroad
also
disputes
judge
wards
finding
that
it
didnt
do
enough
to
protect
employees
the
spokeswoman
says
the
railroad
provides
track
workers
with
insect
repellent
and
special
pants
to
protect
against
bug
bites
debate
in
the
scientific
community
over
lyme
disease
could
open
up
some
legal
defenses
for
property
owners
such
as
questioning
whether
a
victim
actually
has
the
disease
rather
than
some
other
illness
earlier
this
week
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
reported
that
doctors
overly
diagnose
patients
as
having
lyme
disease
and
damages
awarded
to
a
victim
also
might
be
influenced
by
medical
disputes
over
the
degree
of
harm
that
lyme
disease
causes
because
of
health
and
safety
concerns
some
groups
and
companies
already
take
special
measures
to
protect
against
lyme

sit

your

you
into
medicine
your
academic

make
a
decision
about

really

i
had

dropped

applied
four
years
in

before
they
were

medicine
as

is
a

you
must
make
for
yourself
dont
be

into

because
of
your

other
if
you
still
want
to
be
a
medical
doctor
determine
how
you
can
improve
your
application
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
a
professor
who
knows
you
well
and
can
give
an
honest
positive
recommendation
is
far
better
than
one
from

famous

who
only
vaguely
remembers
your

also
dont
be
afraid
to
ask
these

if
they

an

give
them
a

to

no

of

saying
no

i
have
turned
down
writing
recommendations
for
some
students
because
i
did
not
know
them
well
enough
to
make
any
meaningful
comments
and
some
because
i
honestly
could
not
recommend
them
at
that
point
rewrite
your
personal
statement
take
it
by
an
english
professor
or
some
other
friendly
person
with
skill

experience
in
writing

get

both

the
disease
you

is
toxoplasmosis
it
is
a
protozoan
that
lives

multiplies
within
cells
in
cats
the
protozoan
multiplies
in
the
intestinal
cells
and
eggs
are
shed
in
the
cats
feces
the
protozoa
can
cross
the

to
infect
the

the
disease
may
be
asymptomatic
after
the

is

it
may

may

having

the

they
did

were

the

were

telling
us
that
none
of

interact

even
took

if

disoriented
they
should
put
him
on

else

a

i

more

take

it
seems
to
me
that
medical
science
understands
precious
little
about
taking
care
of
the
human
machine
drugs
are
given
as
a
response
to
symptoms
and
i
guess
that
makes
sense
since
all
the
studies
that
validate
the
effectiveness
of
those
drugs
are
based
on
a
narrow
assessment
of
the
degree
of
particular
symptoms
but
there
seems
to
be
very
little
appreciation
for
the
wellbeing
of
a

i

needless

it

it
lasts

it
lasts

it

called

later
learnt

the

applied
to

got
two
interviews
got
one
offer
and
am
waiting
to
hear
from
the
other
school
let
me
be
honest
about
my
experiences
and
impressions
about
the
medical
school
admissions
process
numbers
gpa
mcats
are
not
everything
but
they
are
probably
more
important
than
anything
else
in
fact
some
schools
screen
out
applicants
based
on
these
numbers
and
never
even
look
at
your
other
qualities
of
course
when
this
happens
dont
expect
a
refund
on
your
application
fee
but
the
fact
that
you
got
four
interviews
tells
me
that
you
have
the
numbers
and
are
very
well
qualified
academically
you
mentioned
one
response
was
it
an
acceptance
denial
or
waitlist
if
i
assume
the
worst
that
it
was
a
denial
then
you
still
have
a
great
probability
of
acceptance
somewhere
how
did
your
interviews
go
as
for
how
long
you
have
to
wait
ive
called
a
few
schools
who
never
contacted
me
for
anything
many
of
them
told
me
that
the
interview
season
for
them
was
over
and
that
if
i
havent
heard
by
now
i
can
assume
a
denial
many
rejection
letters
are
not
sent
out
until
may
or
as
late
as
june
but
some
schools
are
still
interviewing
i
really
dont
think
you
should
worry
dont
become
fixated
on
the
mailbox
go
out
have
fun
be
very
proud
of
yourself
what
do
people
think
of
the
medical
school
admissions
process
i
had
a
very
mediocre
gpa
but
high
mcat
scores
and
i
have
been
working
as
a
software
engineer
for
two
years
i
majored
in
computer
science
at
stanford
still
i
think
the
profile
of
the
person
who
has
the
best
chance
of
getting
admitted
is
something
like
this
very
important
gpa

i
think
admissions
committees
are
bound
in
many
ways
by
the
numbers
but
would
like
very
much
to
understand
each
person
as
an
individual
sometimes
thats
just
not
practical
but
getting
four
interviews
is
an
indicator
that
you
have
the
numbers
hopefully
you
were
able
to
impress
them
with
your
character

i
have
a
fairly
severe

a

a
gently

to

then
it
falls
off
a
cliff
to
down
from
on
this
type
of
loss
is
difficult
to
fit
i
am
currently
using
some
old
siemens
behind
the
ear
aids
which
keep
me
roughly
functional
but
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
recently
i
had
an
opportunity
to
test
the
widex
behind
the
ear
aids
for
several
weeks
these
have
four
independent
programs
which
are
intended
to
be
customized
for
different
hearing
situations
and
can
be
reprogramed
i
found
them
to
be
a
definite
improvement
over
my
current
aids
and
was
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
another
local
outfit
advertised
a
free
trial
of
another
programmable
system
called
resound
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
try
the
resound
aids
in
their
office
for
about
minutes
and
i
couldnt
compare
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
was
able
to
read
about
the
theory
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separate
posting
they
also
carry
the
widex
aids
and
had
one
patient
presumably
wealthy
who
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchased
the
widex
only
months
ago
the
problem
is
that
the
resound
aids
are
about
twice
as
expensive
as
the
widex
and
other
programmable
aids
i
could
take
a
trip
to
europe
on
the
difference
being
a
lover
of
bargains
and
hating
to
spend
money
i
am
having
a
hard
time
persuading
myself
to
go
with
the
resounds
i
would
appreciate
any
opinions
on
this
and
other
hearing
aids

projections
about
when
and
if
i

david
this
study
looks
like
a
good
one
gordon
rubenfeld
did
a
medline
search
and
also
sent
me
the
same
reference
through
email
since
commercial
yogurt
does
not
always
have
a
good
lactobacillus
a
or
bulgaricus
culture
a
negative
finding
would
not
have
been
too
informative
this
is
often
the
reason
why
lactobacillus
acidophilus
tablets
are
recommended
rather
than
yogurt
i
guess
the
next
question
is
why
would
this
introduction
of
good
bacteria
back
into
the
gut
decrease
the
incidence
of
vaginal
candida
blooms
if
the
anus
was
not
serving
as
a
candida
reservoira
fact
that
gordon
r
vehementy
denys
i
see
two
possible
theories
one
the
l
acidophilus
which
is
a
facultatively
anaerobic
bacterium
could
make
it
through
the
gut
and
colonize
the
rectal
area
to
overgrow
the
candida
this
would
not
explain
the
reoccurance
of
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
after
the
yogurt
ingestion
was
stopped
though
the
other
is
that
the
additional
bacteria
in
the
intestinal
tract
remove
most
of
the
glucose
from
the
feces
and
candida
looses
its
major
food
source
getting
lactobacillus
acidophilus
to
colonize
the
vaginal
tractwhere
it
is
normally
found
would
have
a
much
better
effect
on
the
recurrance
of
vaginal
yeast
blooms
though
an
acetic
acid
lactobacillus
acidophilus
douche
has
been
used
to
get
this
effect
but
ive
not
seen
any
such
treatment
reported
in
the
medical
literature
this
would
be
an
example
of
physicians
conducting
their
own
clinical
trials
to
try
to
come
up
with
treatments
that
help
their
patients
when
this
is
done
in
private
practice
the
results
are
rarely
if
ever
published
it
was
the
hallmark
of
medicine
until
the
modern
age
emerged
with
clinical
trials
it
really
raises
a
big
question
does
the
medical
profession
cast
out
the
adventerous
few
who
try
new
treatments
to
help
patients
or
does
it
look
the
other
way
this
particular
issue
is
really
a
very
simple
one
since
no
real
dangerous
therapy
is
involvedeven
the
antifungals
are
not
all
that
dangerous
but
there
are
some
areaslike
edta
chelation
therapy
where
the
fire
is
pretty
hot
and
somebody
could
get
burned
its
really
tough
do
i
follow
only
well
established
protocols
and
then
give
up
if
they
dont
work
that
well
or
do
it
try
something
that
looks
like
it
will
work
but
hasnt
been
proven
to
work
yet
my
stand
is
to
consider
other
treatment
possibilities
especially
if
they
involve
little
or
no
risk
to
the
patient
getting
good
bacteria
back
into
the
gut
after
antibiotic
treatment
is
one
treatment
possibility
the
other
is

what

this

you

the

and
the

ellison
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the

are
what
we
calls
lichtenberg
figures
an
effect
of
intermittent
ionization
of
the
air
around
the
object
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
not
wiping
off
the
plates
but
it
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
kirlian
electrophotography
has
much
more
limited
value
if
any
than
was
previously
widely
thought
electrical
and
magnetic
fields
generated
by
the

are
much
too
small
to
be
of

im

its
another
opporitunity

a

hundred
extra

for
a
completely
unnecessary
procedure
the
rationale
for
which
until
recently
has
been
accepted
without

by
most
parents
of
newborns
one
could
also
imagine
that
complications
arising
from

infections
sloppy
jobs
etc
are
far
more
common
than
the
remote
chance
of
penile
cancer
it
is
purported
to
prevent
cant
imagine
what
its
like
to
have
a
penis
much
less
a
foreskin
i
guess
if
american
medicine
did
an
artistic
job
of
circumcising
every
male
then
the
visual
result
would
be
somewhat
more
natural
in
appearance

remember
at

on

goes

americans
are
just

hung
up

cleaning

this

i
think
i
can
explain
the

story
i
have
actually
seen
a
reproduction
of
that
particular
kirlian
photograph
in
a

compiled

people
who
were
enthusiasts
of

that

thats
right
the
effect
has
been
observed
only
once
even
the
writers
of
the
book
were
inclined
to
disbelieve
in
it
i
conjecture
that
the
maker
of
that
photograph
began
by
placing
a
whole
leaf
between
two
plates
and
taking
its
kirlian
photo
for
his
next
experiment
he
cut
the
leaf
in
half
put
one
half
down
between
the
same
two
plates
and
took
another
k
p
the
missing
half
effect
was
created
by
water
oils
etc
left
behind
after

this

it
did
a

of
reducing

down

then
i

for

the

stopped
working
very

cholesterol

soared
the

might
have
stabilized
over

a

had
me
quit
wait
a
month
then
switch
to
mevicore
on
mevicore
my
total
cholesterol
was
down
to
ldl
was
and
hdl
was
but
the
trigs
were
still
very
high
around
and
my

tests
came
back
slightly
abnormal
sgot
n
ggtphard
to
read

n
he
said
the
liver
numbers
were
not
offbase
enough
to
cause
him
concern
and
the
triglycerides
are
not
as
important
as
the
cholesterol
figures
he
had
me
stop
the
mevicore
to
allow
the
liver
to
heal
just
to
be
extra
cautious
though
im
sure
its
not
a
problem
and
wants
me
to
go
back
on
it
after
that
i
suggested
maybe
lopid
might
be
the
better
choice
and
he
said
that
he
wouldnt
object
if
thats
what
i
want
to
do
but
lopid
has
one
particular
side
effect
im
not
fond
of
should
the
above

what

with

small

as
i
understand

the
hernia
is
a
relatively
minor
problem
though
i
do
occasionally
have
some
nasty
heartburn
that
is
probably
related
to
it
the
schatzki
ring
on
the
other
hand
is
causing
swallowing
difficulty
in
particular
if
im
not
careful
about
eating
slowly
and
thoroughly
chewing
food
food
occasionally
gets
stuck
before
reaching
my
stomach
this
results
in
a
period
of
painful
spasms
as
the
food
attempts
to
pass
the
obstruction
fortunately
the
food
has
always
managed
to
pass
but
this
is
annoying
and
causes
frequent
discomfort
my
doctor
wants
to
dilate
the
ring
using
the
following
procedure
use
an
endoscope
to
examine
the
esophagus
and
stomach
for
any
inflammation
then
cut
through
the
ring
and
dilate
it
by
passing
some
kind
of
balloon
or
something
thru
the
esophagous
i
would
like
to
know
if
anyone
out

has
had
this

a
similar

doneif

was
it

asked

so
many
xrays
were
being
made
she
was
told
by
a
technician
that
they
need
to
see
the
area
from
different
views
but
she
says
that
about
five
xrays
were
made
from
each
angle
she
couldnt

feeling

something
must

wait
in

more

for

mrs
a
research
team
led
by
brian
d
ross
md
d
phil
conducted
a
study
on
elderly
patients
who
were
believed
to
be
suffering
from
some
form
of
dementia
the

clinical

an

by

the
current
standard

care
in
testing
for
alzheimers
disease
calls
for
lengthy
memory
function
and
neuropsychological
tests
which
can
be
very
upsetting
to
the
patient
are
not
definitive
and
can
only
be
confirmed
by
autopsy
in
addition
to
alzheimers
disease
the
new
clinical
proton
mrs
exam
may
have
applications
in
diagnosing
other
dementias
including
aidsrelated
dementia
parkinsons
disease
and
huntingtons
disease
weve
developed
a
simple
test
which
can
be
administered
quickly
and
relatively
inexpensively
using
existing
mri
equipment
fitted
with
either
the
mrs
or
probe
software
said
dr
ross
adding
this
will
help
physicians
to
diagnose
alzheimers
earlier
and
intervene
with
therapeutics
before
the
progression
of
the
disease
causes
further
damage
to
the
delicate
inner
workings
of
the
brain
dr
ross
and
his
hmri
team
measured
a
family
of
chemicals
in
the
brain
known
as
inositols
and
myoinositol
mi
acted
as
a
marker
in
the
study
in
comparison
to
healthy
patients
those
diagnosed
with
alzheimers
showed
a
percent
increase
in
mi
while
their
level
of
another
chemical
called
nacetylaspartate
naa
was
significantly
lower
indicating
a
loss
of
brainstimulating
neurons
believed
to
be
associated
with
the
progression
of
the
disease
current
drug
therapy
for
alzheimers
disease
is
widely
considered
to
be
inadequate
this
is
attributable
dr
ross
believes
to
the
theory
that
alzheimers
is
caused
by
an
interruption
in
the
transmission
of
the
chemical
acetylcholine
to
the
nerve
cells
this
belief
has
been
adhered
to
over
the
last
years
and
consequently
most
drugs
to
treat
alzheimers
were
based
on
the
changing
receptors
for
acetylcholine
physicians
have
a
real
need
for
a
test
to
differentiate
alzheimers
from
other
dementias
to
provide
the
patient
and
his
or
her
family
with
a
firm
diagnosis
and
to
monitor
future
treatment
protocols
for
the
treatment
of
this
disease
for
this
reason
we
consider
this
test
a
major
advancement
in
medicine

on
alzheimers

what
is
alzheimers
disease
and
how
is
it
caused
alzheimers
disease
ad
is
an
incurable
degenerative
disease
of
the
brain
first
described
in
by
the
german
neuropathologist
alois
alzheimer
as
the
disease
progresses
it
leads
to
loss
of
memory
and
mental
functioning
followed
by
changes
in
personality
loss
of
control
of
bodily
functions
and
eventually
death
how
many
people
does
it
affect
alzheimers
disease
affects
an
estimated
million
adults
in
the
united
states
and
is
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
death
taking
approximately
lives
each
year
while
alzheimers
debilitates
its
victims
it
is
equally
devastating
both
emotionally
and
financially
for
patients
families
ad
is
the
most
common
cause
of
dementia
in
adults
symptoms
worsen
every
year
and
death
usually
occurs
within
years
of
initial
onset
what
are
its
signs
and
symptoms
although
the
cause
of
ad
is
not
known
two
risk
factors
have
been
identified
advanced
age
and
genetic
predisposition
the
risk
of
developing
ad
is
less
than
one
percent
before
the
age
of
yars
old
but
increases
steeply
in
each
successive
decade
of
life
to
reach
percent
by
the
age
of
in
patients
with
familial
ad
immediate
family
relatives
have
a
percent
chance
of
developing
ad
one
of
its
first
symptoms
is
severe
forgetfulness
caused
by
shortterm
memory
loss
dr
herman
weinreb
of
the
school
of
medicine
at
new
york
university
says
whether
forgetfulness
is
a
serious
symptom
or
not
is
largely
a
matter
of
degree
and
suggests
the
following
criteria
forgetting
the
name
of
someone
you
see
infrequently
is
normal
forgetting
the
name
of
a
loved
one
is
serious
forgetting
where
you
left
your
keys
is
normal
forgetting
how
to
get
home
is
serious
doctors
suggest
that
people
with
severe
symptoms
should
be
evaluated
in
order
to
rule
out
alzheimers
disease
and
other
forms
of
dementia

to
try
a

such

i

about

any
info
would
be
appreciated
thanks
youve
asked
a
toughie
of
a
question
there
are
many
different
drugs
which
are
used
for
chemotherapy
the
overall
purpose
of
chemotherapy
dont
worry
about
the
spelling
some
of
these
crazy
medical
words
are
impossible
to
spell
is
to
either
destroy
cancer
cells
or
to
keep
them
from
growing
different
drugs
have
different
effects
on
cancer
cells
and
therefore
it
is
not
uncommon
to
use
more
than
one
drug
at
a
time
some
chemotherapeutic
drugs
are
effective
anytime
during
the
growth
cycle
of
a
cell
others
work
only
at
specific
times
during
the
cell
cycle
the
first
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
is
it
is
when
the
protein
synthesis
and
rna
systhesis
occurs
in
the
second
phase
s
synthesis
of
dna
occurs
the
third
phase
is
the
dna
splits
and
rna
and
protein
are
synthesized
aagain
in
the
fourth
phase
m
or
mitosis
the
cell
may
divide
there
are
drugs
which
are
effective
in
each
phase
some
stop
dna
synthesis
others
stop
the
cell
from
dividing
others
wreck
protein
synthesis
at
any
rate
the
end
result
that
is
being
sought
is
for
the
cancer
cells
to
stop
growing
if
what
you
are
seeking
is
practical
advice
i
apologize
for
rambling
on
the
techno
stuff
some
side
effects
are
pretty
common
chemo
drugs
are
rather
nasty
it
can
cause
a
person
to
lose
their
appetite
and
to
experience
nausea
and
vomiting
things
to
help
this
include
eating
small
frequent
meals
it
is
also
suggested
that
if
nauseavomiting
hereafter
known
as
nv
occurs
that
the
person
notify
the
doctor
there
are
medicines
tthat
help
nausea
diarrhea
can
be
an
effect
antidiarrheal
medications
can
be
given
and
good
skincare
and
fluid
intake
are
important
probably
the
one
of
biggest
concsern
is
hair
loss
this
does
not
always
happen
it
depends
on
what
drugs
are
being
given
and
on
the
person
themself
different
people
taking
the
same
drug
can
and
do
have
different
side
effects
i
have
seen
some
literature
which
states
that
wearing
a
snug
headband
andor
wearing
an
ice
cap
can
help
reduce
hair
loss
presumably
by
reducing
blood
flow
to
the
scalp
if
anyone
has
seen
research
on
this
too
i
would
love
to
see
it
and
possibly
some
bib
data
i
highly
recommend
making
contact
with
the
american
cancer
society
they
have
a
vast
selection
of
literature
and
information
in
addition
if
your
friend

had
a

i
highly
recommend
reach

it
is
a
support
group
comprised
entirely
of
women
who

because

apologize
i
am
trying
to
pull
this
off
the

i
will
post
what
i
discovered
in
research
i
did
a
paper
on
the
topic
in
my
research
class
in
nursing
school
it
really
is
a
decision
that
is
up
to
the
parents
some
parents
use
the
reasoning
that
they
will
look
like
daddy
and
like
their
friends
as
justification
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
just
be
sure
it
is
what
you
want
to
do
since
it
is
rather
difficult
to
uncircumcise
a
male
although
a
major
surgical
procedure
exists
how
about
the
pregnant
woman
sitting
in
a
tub
of
water
weve
heard
stories
of
infection
etc
how
about
after
the
water
has
broken
as
long
as
your
membranes
have
not
broken
and
you
have
not
had
any
problems
with
your
pregnancy
it
should
be
ok
to
sit
in
a
tub
of
water
however
i
would
recommend
using
your
own
bathtub
in

first
of

i
would
want
to

who
sponsored

i
have
seen
too
many

disclaimers

perhaps
it
wont
be
long
before
another

up

a
curious

with

is
that
they
are
oftentimes
just
plain
wrong
it
wouldnt
be
the

sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus
ratios
are
in
my
opinion
still
the
most
reliable
indicators
for
the
cause
treatment
and
prevention
of
kidney

i
for
one
will
continue
to
recommend
the
most
logical
changes
in
ones
diet
or
through
supplementation
to
counteract
or
prevent
kidney
stones
of
either
type
and
they
definitely
wont
include
an
increase
in
calcium
if
the
stones
have
been
identified
as
being
of
the
calcium
type
and
peoples
chemical

confirms
that
they
would

more

for

can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
the
difference
between
a
persistent
disease
and
a
chronic
one
for
example
persistent
hepatitis
vs
chronic
hepatitis
i
dont
think
there
is
a
general
distinction
rather
there
are
two
classes
of
chronic
hepatitis
chronic
active
hepatitis
and
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
i
cant
think
of
any
other
disease
where
the
term
persistent
is
used
with
or
in
preference
to
chronic
much
as
these
two
terms
chronic
active
and
chronic
persistent
sound
fuzzy
the
actual
distinction
between
the
two
conditions
is
often
fairly
fuzzy

anything

it

summarized
he

had

heartbeats
for
the

to
years
and
once
was

from

thin

not

im

accept
the
extra
beats
as
normal
but
dont
want
to
ignore
them
if
they
might
be
some
kind
of
warning
symptom
the
number
of
pvcs
seems
to
increase
throughout
the

with

something
as

could
they
possibly
be

to
the
esophagous
problems
both
seemed
to
develop
at
about
the

time
i
not
an

on
heart

pvcs
are
common

have
been

that
my
pvcs

go
with
some
months
causing
anxiety
taking
on
more
fluids
seems
to
help
and
they
seem
worse
in
the
summer
remember
that
a
slow
heart
rate
will
allow
more
pvcs
to
be
apparent
so
perhaps
it
is
an
indication
of
a
healthy
cardiac

ask

i
might
add

im

it
was
sure
an

prescription
the

are
not

affects

a

is
colonic

cross

should
one
just
leave

not

with
it
or
should
you
clean
it
out
every
so
often

cleaning

your

are
there
any

in

might

assuming

the

you
can
try
some

with

it
is
awkward
to
do

may

she
does

in

do
not

anything
with

my
experience
has
been
that
this

initially
best
handled
by
a

person
i
say
initially
because
an

can
evaluate
whether

you
might
have

on

how
much
was
discovered
by
canadians
actually
there
are
many
more
who
were
born

but
became
americans
after

please
note
a

of
people
have
nominated
alexander

bell
but
i
feel
he
was
really
a
scottishamerican
with
a
summer
home
in
canada
now
i
know
this
is
debatable
but
please
dont
nominate
him
again
if
anyone
can
fill
in
some
of
the
question
marks
on
the
list
please
drop
me
a
line
that
was
two
years
ago
since
then
i
have
received
a
grant
from
science
culture
canada
a
division
of
supply
and
services
canada
to
research
the
book
since
my
old
posting
the
book
has
evolved
into
an
educational
book
for
kids
aged
though
this
may
change
again
it
will
have
about
twopage
spreads
with
a
large
graphic
in
the
middle
and
textgraphic
boxes
all
around
on
the
following
subjects
vital
statistics
and
photo
of
the
scientist
personal
statement
from
the
scientist
narrative
of
a
few
moments
in
the
life
of
the
scientist
what
i
was
doing
when
i
was
so
you
want
to
be
a
insert
kind
of
scientist
experiment
you
can
do
there
will
be
an
appendix
with
more
scientists
with
one
paragraph
biographies
who
didnt
quite
make
it
to
the
double
spreads
the
whole
thing
will
then
be
published
on
cdrom
with
video
and
sound
clips
for
added
richness
i
am
looking
for
a
cdrom
publisher
as
well
the
text
part
may
also
be
available
on
the
canarie
electronic
highway
being
developed
in
canada
as
well
i
am
still
looking
for
a
publisher
though
penguin
canada
came
close
to
being
it
hope
to
find
one
soon
i
would
like
to
again
ask
for
more
nominations
especially
in
the
pure
sciences
of
physics
chemistry
and
biology
also
criticisms
of
the
list
are
welcomed
also
women
and
frenchcanadian
scientists
are
needed
i
hope
this
posting
will
get
others
to
nominate
more
great
canadian
scientists
and
to
discuss
what
is
great
what
is
canadian
and
what

was
indeed
a

not

you

the
fact

the
world
was

was
well
known
when
he

was
also
well

the

you
would
neither

nobody
thought
he
would
fall
off
the

of
the

instead
they
expected
him
to

columbus
thought
for
no
good

that
the
circumference
was
only
miles
making
the

unfortunately
for

his

the

circumference
is
indeed
miles
fortunately
for

there
was
a

students
are
can
anyone
suggest
techniques
for
this
type
of
memorization
i
have
had
reasonable
success
with
nemonics
and
memory
tricks
like
thinking
up
little
stories
to
associate
unrelated
things
but
i
have
never
applied
them
to
large
amounts

has
anyone
had

all
you
have
to
do
is
learn
the

conceptually
i
have
no
problem
with
that
it
is
one
of
my
strong

you
cant

centipedes

not

i

some
millipedes
cause

sting
so
i

merely
on

much

from

bout
with
kidney

there
isnt
any
medication
that
can
do
anything
about
them
except
relieve
the
pain
either
they
pass
or
they
have
to
be
broken
up
with
sound
or
they
have
to
be

in

with

on

continue

a
family
member
of
mine
is
suffering
from
a
severe
depression
brought
on
by
menopause
as
well
as
a
mental
break
down
she
is
being
treated
with
halydol
with
some
success
but
the
treatments
being
provided
through
her
psychiatrist
are
not
satisfactory
someone
suggested
contacting
a
nutritionist
to
discuss
alternative
treatment
since
she
is
sensitive
to
medication
i
think
this
is
a
good
suggestion
but
dont
know
where
to
begin
if
anyone
can
suggest
a
philly
area
nutritionist
or
else
some
literature
to
read
id
appreciate
it
lida
i
can
emphasize
with
your
situation
both
my
wife
and
i
suffered
from
bouts
of
depression
hers
was
brought
on
by
breast
cancer
and
mine
was
a
rebound
stress
reaction
to
her
modified
radical
mastectomy
and
chemotherapy
lida
i
used
my
knowledge
of
nutrition
to
get
her
through
her
six
months
of
chemotherapywith
the
approval
of
her
oncologist
when
severe
depression
set
in
a
few
months
after
the
chemo
stopped
i
tried
to
use
supplements
to
bring
her
out
of
it
i
had
cured
her
pms
using
supplements
and
i
really
thought
that
i
knew
enough
about
the
role
of
diet
in
depression
to
take
care
of
her
depression
as
well
it
didnt
work
and
she
was
put
on
prozac
by
her
oncologist
two
winters
agothree
years
after
by
wifes
breast
cancer
i
got
hit
with
severe
depressionpretty
typical
and
one
reason
why
many
marriages
break
up
after
breast
cancer
or
another
stressor
i
tried
to
take
care
of
it
for
several
months
with
supplementation
didnt
work
my
internist
ended
up
putting
me
on
prozac
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
list
of
several
studies
that
have
been
done
using
niacin
folate
and
to
cure
depression
im
not
going
to
do
that
because
all
you
would
be
doing
is
flying
blind
like
i
was
lida
i
do
believe
that
depression
can
have
a
dietary
component
but
the
problem
is
that
you
need
to
know
exactly
what
the
problem
is
and
then
use
an
approach
which
will
fix
the
problem
for
chemotherapy
i
knew
exactly
what
drugs
were
going
to
be
used
and
exactly
what
nutrients
would
be
affected
same
thing
for
pms
i
was
flying
blind
for
both
of
these
stressors
but
the
literature
that
i
used
to
devise
a
treatment
program
was
pretty
good
depression
is
just
too
complicated
what
you
really
need
is
a
nutritional
scan
this
is
not
a
diet
analysis
but
an
analysis
of
your
bodies
nutrient
reserves
for
every
vitamin
and
mineralexcept
vitamin
c
you
have
a
reserve
the
rda
is
not
designed
to
give
you
enough
of
any
nutrient
to
keep
these
reserves
full
it
is
only
designed
to
keep
them
from
being
emptied
which
would
cause
clinical
pathology
stress
will
increase
your
need
for
many
vitamins
and
minerals
this
is
when
your
reserves
become
very
important
lida
without
your
permission
im
going
to
use
your

as
a

i
can

out

ive
been
asked
to
do
i
am
now
in
the
process
of
trying
to
get
a
grant
to
setup
a
nutrition

lab
this
is
the
last
peice
of
the
nutrition
puzzle
that
i
need
to
make
my
education
program
complete
this
lab
will
let
me
measure
the
nutrient
reserve
for
almost
all
the
vitamins
and
minerals
that
are
known
to
be
required
in
humans
the
mayo
clinic
already
uses
a
similiar

design

is

organization
with

in

oklahomatulsa
also
operates

i
also
believe
that
the
pritikin
clinic
in
california
has
a
similiar
lab
setup
for
physicians
reading
this
post
i
would
suggest
that
you
get
the
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
that
has
just
been
publishedfeb
by
mosby
i
have
been
using
alpers
manual
of
nutritional
therapeuticsa
little
brown
series
book
as
a
supplemental
text
for
my
course
but
alpers
is
geared
more
to
residency
training
two
mds
have
written
this
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
and
it
is
geared
more
towards
medical
student
education
and
it
does
a
good
job
of
covering
the
lab
tests
that
can
be
run
to
assess
a
patients
nutritional
status
let
me
quote
a
few
sentences
from
the
preface
of
this
new
text
socalled
nutrition
specialists
were
in
reality
gastroenterologists
hematologists
or
pediatricians
who
just
happened
to
profess
some
knowledge
of
nutrition
as
it
related
to
their
field
of
practice
unfortunately
about
two
thirds
of
the
medical
schools
in
the
united
states
require
no
formal
instruction
in
nutrition
but
times
and
medical
practice
have
changed
more
than
half
of
the
leading
causes
of
death
in
this
country
are
nutrition
related
this
monograph
should
accomplish
the
following
two
objectives
it
should
complement
your
medical
training
by
emphasizing
the
relevance
of
nutrition
to
your
medical
practice
and
it
should
heighten
your
awareness
of
nutrition
as
a
medical
speciality
that
is
vitally
important
for
both
disease
prevention
and
the
treatment
of
diseases
of
essentially
every
organ
system

my
advise
to
you
is
that
you
tell
your
family
members
to
try
to
find
a
physician
who
has
an
understanding
of
the
role
that
vitamins
and
minerals
yes
even
magnesium
may
play
a
role
in
depression
play
in
depression
and
who
could
get
a
nutritional
profile
run
menopause
is
often
a
time
when
women
suffer
depression
there
are
a
lot
of
hormonal
changes
that
are
occuring
but
they
are
not
the
same
ones
that
occur
during
pms
a
nutritionist
may
also
be
able
to
help
not
too
long
ago
a
poster
mentioned
that
his
nutritionist
had
diagnosed
a
selenium
deficiency
based
on
a
red
cell
glutathionine
peroxidase
testthe
specific
test
for
the
selenium
reserve
most
clinical
labs
will
not
run
this
test
and
i
advised
him
to
try
to
make
sure
that
the
lab
that
did
the
test
was
certified
there
are
also
a
lot
of
hair
and
nail
analysis
labs
setup
to
do
trace
mineral
analysis
but
these
labs
are
not
regulated
checks
of
these
labs
using
certified
standards
and
also
those
doing
water
lead
analysis
showed
some
pretty
shoddy
testing
was
going
on
if
you
or
anyone
else
finds
someone
who
will
run
these
speciality
nutrition
tests
make
sure
that
they
are
using
a
lab
that
has
been
certified
under
cliathe
clinical
laboratory
improvement
act
a
diet
analysis
may
be
helpful
since
many
nutrient
reserves
have
been
shown
to
correlate
fairly
well
with
the
dietary
intake
as
monitored
by
food
logging
and
software
analysisnutritionist
iv
and
other
software
programs
but
there
are
still
about
half
of
the
nutrients
required
by
humans
that
do
not
show
a
very
good
correlation
between
apparent
dietary
intake
and
reserve
status
until
we
have
more
nutritional
assessment
clinical
labs
in
operation
in
the
us
and
physicians
who
have
been
trained
how
to
use
the
nutritional
profile
that
these
labs
provide
to
devise
a
treatment
approach
that
uses
diet
changes
and
supplementation
antidepressants
will
probably
continue
to
be
the
best
approach
to
depression

subject
re
earwax
hi
stephen
ear
wax
is
a
healthy
way
to
help
prevent
ear
infections
both
by
preventing
a
barrier
and
also
with
some
antibiotic
properties
too
much
can
block
the
external
auditory
canal
the
hole
in
the
outside
of
the
ear
and
cause
some
hearing
problems
it
is
very
simple
and
safe
to
remove
excess
wax
on
your
own
or
at
your
physicians
office
you
can
take
a
syringe
no
needles
and
fill
it
with
warm
water
cold
can
cause
fainting
and
otc
hydrogen
peroxide
then
point
the
ear
towards
the
ceiling
about
degrees
up
and
insert
the
tip
of
the
syringe
helps
to
have
someone
else
do
this
and
firmly
expell
the
solution
depending
on
the
size
of
the
syringe
and
the
tenacity
of
the
wax
this
could
take
several
rinses
if
you
place
a
bowl
under
the
ear
to
catch
the
water
it
will
be
much
drier
you
can
buy
a
syringe
with
a
special
tip
at
your
local
pharmacy
or
just
use
whatever
you
may
have
if
wax
is
old
it
will
be
harder
and
darker
you
can
try
adding
a
few
drops
of
olive
oil
into
the
ear
during
a
shower
to
soften
up
the
wax
do
this
for
a
couple
days
then
try
syringing
again
it
is
also
safe
to
point
your
ear
up
at
the
shower
head
and
allow
the
water
to
rinse
it
out

i
personally
wouldnt

and
take
that
nejm
article
on
kidney
stones
as
gospel
first
of
all
i
would
want
to
know
who
sponsored
that
study
i
have
seen
too
many
nutrition
bulletins
over
the
years
from
local
newspapers
magazines
to
tvguide
with
disclaimers
on
the
bottom
informing
us
that
this
great
health
news
was
brought
to
us
compliments
of
the
dairy
industries
there
are
of
course
numerous
other
interest
groups
now
that
thrive
financially
on
the
media
hype
created
from
the
supposedly
enormous
benefits
of
increasing
ones
calcium
intake
secondly
were
all
the
kidney
stones
of
the
test
subjects
involved
in
that
project
analysed
for
their
chemical
composition
the
study
didnt
say
that
it
only
claimed
that
most
kidney
stones
are
large
ly
calcium
perhaps
it
wont
be
long
before
another
study
comes
up
with
the
exact
opposite
findings
a
curious
phenomenon
with
researchers
is
that
they
are
oftentimes
just
plain
wrong
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
time
sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus
ratios
are
in
my
opinion
still
the
most
reliable
indicators
for
the
cause
treatment
and
prevention
of
kidney
stones
i
for
one
will
continue
to
recommend
the
most
logical
changes
in
ones
diet
or
through
supplementation
to
counteract
or
prevent
kidney
stones
of
either
type
and
they
definitely
wont
include
an
increase
in
calcium
if
the
stones
have
been
identified
as
being
of
the
calcium
type
and
peoples
chemical
analysis
confirms
that
they
would
benefit
from
a
phosphorusraising
approach
instead
ron
roth
ron
you
are
absolutely
right
not
all
kidney
stones
have
calcium
and
not
all
calcium
stones
are
calciumoxalate
but
the
vast
majority
are
calcium
oxalate
calcium
is
just
one
piece
of
the
puzzle
i
cited
that
nejm
article
as
a
way
of
pointing
out
to
some
of
the
physicians
in
this
group
that
conventional
wisdom
is
used
in
medicine
always
has
been
and
probably
always
will
be
if
one
uses
conventional

there
is
a
chance
that
you
will
be
wrong
as
long
as
the
error
is
not
going

cause
a

damage

balance
is
much
more
important
than
the
dietary

of

i
know
that
you
use
an
electrical
conductance

to
measure
mineral
balance
in
the

i
know
that
you
dont

that
the

usefuli
agree
if
i
can
get
a
good
nutritional

lab
setup
where
i
can
actually
measure
the

some
of

the
question
rebecca
snyder
asks
is
much
like
asking
how
venomous
are
snakes
one
either
wants
to
ask
which
snake
or
point
to
some
reference
on
the
many
different
species
of
snake
similarly
there
are
many
different

of

these
are
different

millipedes
have
two

a

drug
called
sumatripton
i
have
no
idea
of
the

supposedly
utilizes
a

trips
neurotransmitters
my

does
anyone
know
anything
about
this

is
it
in

does
it

ill
tell

all
that

before

i
want
to
get
a
few
things
off
my
chest
i
just
got
blasted
in
email
for
my
kidney

posts
kidney
stones
are
primarily
caused
by
diet
as
is
heart
disease
and
cancer
when
i
give
dietary
advise
it
is
not
intended
to
encourage
people
reading
this
news
groupor
sci
med
nutrition
where
i
do
most
of
my
posting
to
avoid
seeing
a
doctor
nothing
can
be
further
from
the
truth
kidney
stones
can
be
caused
by
tumors
and
this
possibility
has
to
be
ruled
out
but
once
it
is
diet
is
a
good
way
of
preventing
a
reoccurance
same
thing
with
heart
disease
and
cancer
if
you
suspect
that
you
may
have
a
problem
with
one
of
these
diseases
dont
use
what
im
going
to
tell
you
or
what
you
read
in
some
book
to
avoid
going
to
a
doctor
you
have
to
go
hopefully
you
will
find
a
doctor
who
knows
enough
about
nutrition
to
help
you
change
your
risk
factors
for
both
diseases
as
part
of
a
treatment
programbut
the
odds
are
that
you
will
not
and
thats
why
im
here
when
my
wife
detected
a
lump
in
here
breast
i
didnt
say
dont
worry
my
vitamin
e
will
take
care
of
it
any
breast
lump
has
to
be
worked
up
by
a
physician
plan
and
simple
if
its
begninwhich
most
are
fine
then
maybe
a
diet
change
and
supplementation
will
prevent
further
breast
lumps
from
occuring
but
let
me
tell
you
right
now
if
you
have
tried
diet
and
supplementation
and
another
lump
returns
get
your
butt
into
the
doctors
office
as
fast
as
your
little
feet
can
carry
youbetter
yet
have
a
mammography
done
on
a
regular

my
wife
kept
putting
hers
off
both
myself
and
her

told
her
she
needed
to
have

her
gynocologist
even
scheduled
one
but
she
didnt

busy
running
the
operating

for
the
biggest
hospital
in
tulsa
one
more
thing
i
am
not
an
orthomolecular
nutritionist
this
group
uses
high
dose
vitamins
and
minerals
to
treat
all
kinds
of
disease
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
vitamins
and
minerals
can
and
do
have
drug
actions
in
the
body
but
you
talk
about
flying
blind
man
this
is
really
blind
treatment
no
drug
could
ever
be
used
as
these
vitamins
and
minerals
are
being
used
im
not
saying
that
some
of
this
stuff
couldnt
be
right
on
the
money
it
may
well
be
but
my
approach
to
nutrition
is
a
lot
like
that
of
weinsier
and
morgan
the
two
mds
who
wrote
the
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
my
push
is
the
nutrient
reserves
and
the
lab
tests
needed
to
measure
these
reserves
and
then
supplementation
or
diet
changes
to
get
these
reserves
built
up
to
where
they
should
be
to
let
you
handle
stress
thats
where
im
coming
from
folks
blast
away
if
you
want
im
not
going
to
change
put
me
in
your
killfile
if
you
want
i
really
dont
care
im
averaging
email
messages
a
day
from
people
who
think
that
ive
got
something
important
to
say
but
im
also
getting
hit
by
a
few
with
an
axe
to
grind
thats
life
chromium
is
one
of
the
trace
elements
it
has
a
very
limitedbut
very
important
role
in
the
body
it
is
used
to
form
glucose
tolerance
factor
gtf
gtf
is
made
up
of
chromium
nicinamideniacin
glycine
cysteine
and
glutamic
only
the
chromium
and
the
niacin
are
needed
from
the
diet
to
form
gtf
some
foods
already
have
gtfliver
brewers
or
nutritional
yeast
and
black
pepper
when
chromium
is
in
gtf
a
pretty
good
absorption
is
seenabout
but
when
it
is
simply
present
as
a
mineral
or
mineral
chelatechromium
picolinate
its
absorption
is
much
to
lowest
for
all
the
minerals
ive
been
posting
in
misc
fitness
and
chromium
has
come
up
there
several
times
as
a
fat
burner
chromium
is
among
the
least
toxic
of
the
minerals
so
you
could
really
load
yourself
up
and
not
really
do
any
harm
i
wouldnt
do
it
though
the
adequate
and
safe
range
for
chromium
is
to
per
day
the
average
american
is
getting
about
per
day
from
hisher
diet
chromium
levels
decrease
with
age
and
many
believe
that
adult
onset
diabetes
is
primarily
a
chromium
deficiency
i
can
cite
you
several
studies
that
have
been
done
with
glucose
tolerance
in
type
ii
diabetes
but
im
not
going
to
because
for
each
positive
one
there
also
seems
to
be
a
negative
one
as
well
im
convinced
that
the
problem
is
bioavailability
when
yeastgtf
is
used
good
results
are
obtained
but
when
chromium
itself
is
used
the
results
are
usually
negative
in
addition
to
type
ii
diabetes
chromiuum
has
been
examined
in
cardiovascular
disease
and
glucoma
again
with
mixed
results
as
far
as
cardiovascular
disease
is
concerned
since
a
high
blood
glucose
level
can
lead
to
cardiovascular
disease
this
possible
link
with
chromium
isnt
too
surprising
glucoma
is
a
little
more
interesting
muscle
eye
focusing
activity
is
primarily
an
insulin
responsive
glucosedriven
metabolic
function
if
this
eye
focusing
activity
is
impairedby
a
lack
of
glucose
due
to
a
poor
insulin
response
intraocular
pressure
is
believed
to
be
elevated
in
a
fairly
large
study
of
pts
with
glaucoma
the
one
consistent
finding
was
a
low
rbc
chromium
j
am
coll
nutr
but
this
one
preliminary
study
should
not
prompt
people
to
go
out
and
start
popping
chromium
supplements
for
one
thing
just
about
every
older
person
is
going
to
have
a
low
rbc
chromium
unless
they
have
been
taking
chromium
suppleemntsyeast
since
glucoma
is
often
found
in
older
people
its
not
too
surprising
that
chromium
was
low
in
the
rbcs
if
chromium
supplementation
could
reverse
glucoma
that
would
prompt
some
attention
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
a
clinical
trail
to
check
out
this
possible
chromium
link
to
glucoma
you
could
find
out
what
your
body
chromium
pool
size
was
by
either
the
rbc
chromium
test
or
hair
analysis
most
clinical
labs
are
not
going
to
run
a
rbc
chromium
there
are
plenty
of
labs
that
will
do
a
hair
and
nail
analysis
for
you
but
i
wouldnt
use
them
there
is
just
too
much
funny
business
going
on
in
these
unregulated
labs
right
now
heres
weinsier
and
morgan
advise
on
chromium
they
do
not
consider
chromium
to
be
one
of
those
minerals
for
which
a
reliable
clinical
test
is
availablethey
dont
like
the
hair
and
nail
analysis
labs
either
and
they
also
recognize
the
rbc
chromium
is
primarily
a
research
test
that
is
not
routinely
available
in
most
clinical
chemistry
labs
this
has
to
change
and
as
more
labs
run
a
rbc
chromiuum
it
will
what
then
do
they
suggest
make
a
diagnosis
of
chromium
deficiency
based
on
a
documented
clinical
response
to
chromiumrun
a
glucose
tolerance
test
before
and
after
chromium
supplementation
once
you
make
the
diagnosis
put
the
patient
on
of
orally
each
day
or
of
yeast
per
day
whats
my
advise
dont
take
chromium
supplements
to
try
to
loose
weight
they
just
do
not
work
that
way
if
you
want
to
take
them
and
then
exercise
that
would
be
great
do
include
yeast
as
part
of
your
dietmost
americans
are
not
getting
enough
chromium
from
their
diet
if
you
do
have
a
poor
glucose
tolerance
ask
your
doctor
to
check
your
chromium
status
when
he
or
she
says
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
just
say
please
get
a
copy
of
weinsier
and
morgans
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
and
do
what
they
say
to
do
with
patients
who
present
with
a
poor
glucose
tolerance
if
you
cant
do
that
ill
find
a

who
can
thank
you

says
least
a
few
enlightened
physicians
practicing
in
the
us
its
really
too
bad
that
most
us
medical
schools
dont
cover
nutrition
because
if
they
did
candida
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
case
western
reserve
med
school
teaches
nutrition
in
its
own
section
as
well
as
covering
it
in
other
sections
as
they
apply
ie
deficiency
in
neuro
as
a
cause
of
neuropathy
deficiency
in
hematology
as
a
cause
of
megaloblastic
anemia
yet
i
sill
hold
the
viewpoint
of
mainstream
medicine
candida
can
cause
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
and
in
already
very
sick
patients
with
damaged
immune
systems
like
aids
and
cancer
patients
systemic
candida
infection
i
think
the
yeast
connection
is
a
bunch
of
hooey
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
how
well
nutrition
is
taught
anyway
here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
well
maybe
im
getting
picky
but
i
always
thought
that
a
yeast
was
one
form
that
a
fungus
could
exist
in
the
other
being
the
mold
form
many
fungi
can
occur
as
either
yeasts
or
molds
depending
on
environment
candida
exibits
what
is
known
as
reverse
dimorphism
it
exists
as
a
mold
in
the
tissues
but
exists
as
a
yeast
in
the
environment
should
we
maybe
call
it
a
mold
infection
a
fungus
infection
maybe
we
should
say
it
is
caused
by
a
moldlike
fungus

but
dont
want
to
ignore
them
if
they
might
be
some
kind
of
warning
symptom
the
number
of
pvcs
seems
to
increase
throughout
the
day

with
exercise
or
something
as
simple

climbing

also
if
i
get
up
after

for

i
tend

get
a

of
extra

could
they
possibly
be
related
to
the
esophagous

both
seemed
to
develop
at
about
the

i
not

pvcs
are
common

have
been

i
have
the

an
build
you
do
related

the
heart
that
is
is
that
my
pvcs
come
and
go
with
some
months
causing
anxiety
taking
on
more
fluids
seems
to
help
and
they
seem
worse
in
the
summer
remember
that
a
slow
heart
rate
will
allow
more
pvcs
to
be
apparent
so
perhaps
it
is
an
indication
of
a

cardiac

extra

i
described
them
initially
to
the

theyre
actually
premature

i

sometimes
experience
a

i
think
most
americans
dont
care
about
anything

comlicated
as
that
they
just
think
it
looks
nicer
ask
a
few
of
them
and
see
what
response
you
get
others
still
opt
for
circumcision
due
to
religious
traditions
and
beliefs
some
think
it
is
easier

others
do
it
because

naive

to

are
afraid

my
son
is
not
circumcised
and
i
can
vouch
for
the
argument
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
keep
clean
than
a
circumcised
kids
not
so
much
that
the
foreskin
is
difficult
to
pull
back
it
isnt
but
because
my
son
doesnt
want
to
wait
long
enough
for
a
thorough
check
for

so
many
times
it
just
gets
a
once

it
worries
me
that
he
might
get
an
infection
due
to
his
lack
of
cooperation
i
am
sure
however
that
he
will
be
able
to
handle
cleaning
under
the
foreskin
himself
once
he
is
old
enough

there
is

the

she

so
in
any
case
do
not

anything
with

ill
agree
with
your

while
i
was
a
student
i
had
doctors
remove
rather
surprising
amounts
of
wax
from
my
ears
by
flushing
them
out
a
couple
times
usually
because
they
were
examining
my
ears
for
some
other
reason
and
said
something
like
gee
youve
got
a
lot
of
wax
in
there
in
my
case
removal
of
these
large
wax
buildups
did
noticeably
improve
my
hearing
and
ive
since
gotten
in
the
same
habit
as
your
wife
of
flushing
them
out
with
warm
water
from
a
little
rubber
bulb
every
few
months
you
can
buy
little
bulbs
together
with
ear
drops
for
this
express
purpose
from
the
drug
store
i
dont
notice
that
the
drops
accomplish
much
of
anything
one
question
i
do
have
a
doctor
who
flushed
out
my
ears
once
also
advocated
a
drop
of
rubbing
alcohol
in
them
afterwards
to
flush
out
any
remaining
trapped
water
said
he
told
swimmers
to
do
this

too
it
works

it
stings

ive

is
a

of
hooey
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
how
well
nutrition
is
taught
anyway
elisabeth
lets
set
the
record
straight
for
the
nth
time
i
have
not
read
the
yeast
connection
so
anything
that
i
say
is
not
due
to
brainwashing
by
this
hated
book
its
okay
i
guess
to
hate
the
book
by
why
hate
me
elisabeth
im
going
to
quote
from
zinssers
microbiology
edition
a
book
that
you
should
be
familiar
with
and
not
hate
candida
species
colonize
the
mucosal
surfaces
of
all
humans
during
birth
or
shortly
thereafter
the
risk
of
endogenous
infection
is
clearly
ever
present
indeed
candidiasis
occurs
worldwide
and
is
the
most
common
systemic
mycosis
neutrophils
play
the
main
role
in
preventing
a
systemic
infectioncandidiasis
so
you
would
have
to
have
a
low
neutrophil
count
or
sick
neutrophils
to
see
a
systemic
infection
poor
diet
and
persistent
parasitic
infestation
set
many
third
world
residents
up
for
candidiasis
your
assessment
of
candidiasis
in
the
us
is
correct
and
i
do
not
dispute
it
what
i
posted
was
a
discussion
of
candida
blooms
without
systemic
infection
these
blooms
would
be
responsible
for
local
sites
of
irritation
gi
tract
mouth
vagina
and
sinus
cavity
knocking
down
the
bacterial
competition
for
candida
was
proposed
as
a
possible
trigger
for
candida
blooms
let
me
quote
from
zinssers
again
however
some
factors
such
as
the
use
of
a
broadspectrum
antibacterial
antibiotic
may
predispose
to
both
mucosal
and
systemic
infections
i
was
addressing
mucosal
infections
i
like
the

better
the
nutrition
course
that
i
teach
covers
this
effect
of
antibiotic
treatment
as
well
as
the
cure
i
guess
that
your
nutrition
course
does
not
too
bad
here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
well
maybe
im
getting
picky
but
i
always
thought
that
a
yeast
was
one
form
that
a
fungus
could
exist
in
the
other
being
the
mold
form
many
fungi
can
occur
as
either
yeasts
or
molds
depending
on
environment
candida
exibits
what
is
known
as
reverse
dimorphism
it
exists
as
a
mold
in
the
tissues
but
exists
as
a
yeast
in
the
environment
should
we
maybe
call
it
a
mold
infection
a
fungus
infection
maybe
we
should
say
it
is
caused
by
a
moldlike
fungus

candida
is
classifed

out
it
displays

it
is
capable

you

a

and
that
makes
a

to
you
to

its
a

i
called

you

i
still

such

a

a

thperson
receivving
the

is
gven
a

of
a
radioactive
tracer
and
an
imaging
device
is
used
to
track
the
distribution
of
the
tracer
wwithin
the
body
the
tracer
is
usually
given
intravenously

this
means
that
the
physician

his
assistant
will
insert
a

into
a
vein

inject
medicine
into
the

after

the
person
is
scanned
with
an

device
to
detect
high
concentrations
of

the
radiologist

doctor
is
looking
for
areas
that
take
up
more
of

less

it
as

the

from

what
the

is
probably
looking

are
changes

that
may
have

this
is
also
why

albert
einstein

antihistamine
for
sleep
aid
for
a
very
long
time
ive
had
a
problem
with
feeling
really
awful
when
i
try
to
get
up
in
the
morning
my
sleep
latency
at
night
is
also
pretty
long
ranging
from
min
to
an
hour
i
get
about
hours
of
bedtime
maybe
of
actual
sleep
a
night
and
more
on
the
weekends
i
will
spend
two
or
three
hours
laying
in
bed
after
this
if
i
can
because
i
feel
so
tired
when
i
wake
up
even
more
tired
than
i
was
when
i
went
to
bed
which
is
usually
too
tired
to
work
anyway
i
recently
had
a
really
bad
flu
so
i
called
a
friend
to
get
me
some
cough
syrup
with
both
an
expectorant
and
a
nasal
decongestant
but
he
got
vicks
formula
which
has
everything
but
an
expectorant
so
i
used
that
anyway
and
the
three
nights
i
used
it
i
fell
asleep
rapidly
and
felt
that
i
got
really
good
quality
sleep
that
is
i
actually
felt
refreshed
the
next
morning
so
i
am
now
trying
to
look
into
both
in
the
literature
and
experimentally
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
since
i
am
presuming
that
it
was
the
antihistamine
that
caused
the
effect
the
antihistamine
in
vicks
formula
is
chloriphenamine
maleate
so
i
bought
some
generic
tablets
of
that
and
tried
one
last
night
and
didnt
notice
any
improvement
i
might
try
one
with
a
little
alcohol
about
beer
to
see
if
it
is
a
synergism
effect
also
library
research
seems
to
show
that
benadryl
is
the
antihistamine
with
the
strongest
sedative
effect
of
what
is
availible
otc
so
i
might
also
buy
a
generic
form
of
that
and
try
that
the
pdr
seems
to
suggest
that
mg
is
a
good
dosage
level
to
try
for
other
medical
information
i
have
allergies
but
rarely
have
an
allergic
reaction
living
in
new
mexico
i
also
have
chronically
dry
eyes
which
get
horrible
if
i
try
to
use
most
underarm
deoderants
i
did
guess
that
my
problem
might
be
caused
by
hypoglycemia
so
i
made
some
changes
in
my
diet
consistent
with
that
and
it
didnt
help
so
i
went
back
to
a
normal
diet
pretty
diverse
also
taking
vitamin
supplements
anyway
i
am
looking
for
advice
for
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
and
if
there
are
any
dangers
of
such
use
seems
safe
to
me
since
they
are
used
chronically
for
allergies
by
millions
i
dont
want
to
try
bzs
because
bz
addiction
seems
to
be
a
serious
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
quality
is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep
quality
i
seem
to
wake
up
around
or
so
and
be
in

somehow
the

sounds
to

like
someone
was

there
is
only
one
way
for
pregnancy
to
occur
intercourse
these

however
there
is
also
artificial

techniques
but
were
speaking

here
it
is
possible
for
pregnancy
to
occur

coitus

him

id
been
spending
a
small
fortune
on
various

he
said
all
i
needed
was
a
large
jar
of
vaseline
soak
in
a
lukewarm
tub
of
water
for
minutes
only
minutes
then
massage
in
the
vaseline
to
trap
the
moisture
in
that
will
help
i
havent
tried
it
yet
but
you
can
bet
i
will
the
hard
part
will
be
finding
the
time
to
rub
in
the
vaseline
properly
if
its
not
done
right
you
remain

insensitive

a

was

memorial

because
of
suspected
meningitis
serious
business
they
wanted
to
do
a
lumbar
puncture
for
which
a
ct
scan
is
a
prerequisite
i
arrived
in
her
hospital
room
about
an
hour
after
she
had
returned
from
the
ct
she
was
in
tears
evidently
the
technicians
in
the
ct
lab
had
been
very
unpleasant
to
her
to
begin
with
they
put
her
on
the
apparatus
that
moves
you
into
the
machine
itself
and
just
pushed
a
button
to
slide
her
straight
into
the
machine
without
any
explanation
imagine
this
you
worried
you
may
have
a
deadly
disease
and
next
thing
you
know
youre
being
put
into
this
big
scary
machine
without
a
word
of
explanation
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
i
believe
this
is
inexcusable
she
waved
her
hand
as
if
to
say
what
are
you
doing
to
me
and
they
responded
with
annoyance
and
anger
next
they
inserted
or
tried
to
insert
an
iv
catheter
apparently
she
has
a
lot
of
trouble
with
these
and
complained
of
the
pain
the
technician
just
stopped
and
fixed
her
with
a
glare
without
any
words
of
explanation
is
there
anything
i
can
do
about
these
pigs
i
realize
that
these
technicians
do
this
sort
of
job
day
in
and
day
out
and
that
some
patients
can
be
very
irritating
and
uncooperative
but
this
is
simply
no
excuse
their
purpose
for
existing
is
to
help
sick
people
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
this
sort
of
behavior
fortunately
my
friend
is
fine
but
i
imagine
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
who
get
ct
scans
are
not
fine
at
all
they
have
cancer
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
dont
need
this
kind
of
shit
also
since
i
named
the
hospital
involved
i
should
also
point
out
that
neither
she
nor
i
have
any
complaints
about
the
competence
or
compassion
of
any
of
the

re

biological

robert
im
so
glad
that
you
posted
your
biological
alchemy
discussion
ive
been
compared
to
the
famous
robert
mcelwaine
by
some
readers
of
sci
med
i
didnt
know
how
to
respond
since
i
had
not
seen
one
of
your
postsjust
like
i
havent
read
the
yeast
connection
let
me
just
start
by
stating
that
the
authors
of
the
cold
fusion
papers
of
recent
years
are
now
in
scientific
exilei
believe
that
one
has
actually
left
the
country
scientific
fraud
is
rare
im
still
not
sure
that
if
a
review
of
the
research
notes
of
the
cold
fusion
scientists
actually
proved
fraud
or
just
very
shoddy
experimentation
your
sources
do
not
seem
to
be
research
articles
they
are
more
like
lay
texts
designed
to
pique
human
interest
in
a
subject
areajust
like
the
food
combining
and
life
extension
texts
robert
i
try
to
keep
an
open
mind
but
some
things
i
just
cant
buyone
is
taking
sod
orally
to
prevent
oxidative
damage
in
the
body
your
experiment
if
conducted
by
readers
of
this
news
group
would
prove
that
you
are
rightmore
ash
after
seed
sprouting
than
before
unless
you
use
a
muffle
furnance
and
obtain
a
very
high
temperatureabove
degrees
i
believe
you
will
get
organic
residue
in
the
ash
even
the
residue
in
commercial
incinerators
contains
organic
residue
i
remember
doing
this
kind
of
experiment
in
my
organic
chemistry
couurse
in
college
but
i
couldnt
find
a
temperature
for
mineral
ash
formation
so
im
really
guessing
at
degrees
f
it
may
actually
be
much
higher
the
point
is
that
no
one
in
their
home
could
ever
get
a
high
enough
temperature
to
produce
only
a
mineral
ash
they
also
could
not
measure
the
minerals
so
they
could
only
weigh
the
ash
and
find
out
that
you
appear
to
be
correct
chemical
reactions
abound
in
our
body
in
our
atmosphere
in
our
water
and
in
our
soil
are
these
fusion
reactions
yes
many
of
them
do
involve
fusing
oxygen
nitrogen
and
sulfur
to
both
organics
and
inorganics
do
we
really
have
the
transformation
of
silicone
to
calcium
if
carbon
is
fused
with
silicon
not
in
my
book
robert
silicon
is
the
most
abundant
mineral
on
our
planet
ive
seen
speculation
that
man
could
have
evolved
to
be
a
silicon
based
rather
than
a
carbon
based
lifeform
i
like
reading
science
fiction
as
many
people
do
but
i
know
enough
about
biochemistryand
nutrition
to
be
ablein
most
cases
to
separate
the
fiction
from
the
fact
silicon
may
be
one
of
the
trace
elements
that
turns
out
to
be
essential
in
humans
we
have
several
grams
of
the
stuff
in
our
body
whats
it
doing
there
only
the
lord
knows
right
now
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
do
know
about
silicon
and
why
as
you
state
it
helps
bone
healingand
it
is
not
because
silicon
is
transformed
into
calcium
almost
all
of
the
silicon
in
the
human
body
is
found
in
the
connective
tissuecollagen
and
elastin
there
have
been
studies
published
which
show
that
the
very
high
silicon
content
in
elastin
may
be
an
important
protective
factor
against
atherosclerosisthe
higher
the
silicon
content
in
elastin
the
more
resistant
the
elastin
is
to
a
an
agerelated
loss
of
elasticity
which
may
play
a
role
in
the
increase
in
blood
pressure
that
is
often
seen
as
part
of
the
ageing
process
in
humans
for
bone
fracture
healing
the
first
step
is
a
collagen
matrix
into
which
calcium
and
phosphate
are
pumped
by
osteoblasts
a
high
level
of
silicon
in
the
diet
seems
to
speed
up
this
matrix
formation
this
first
step
in
the
bone
healing
process
seems
to
be
the
hardest
for
some
people
to
get
going
electriacl
currents
have
been
used
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
matrix
forming
cells
oriented
in
the
right
direction
so
that
the
matrix
can
be
formed
in
the
gapor
gaps
between
the
ends
of
the
broken
bone
a
vitamin
c
deficiency
by
slowing
collagen
formation
as
well
as
causing
the
prodcution
of
defective
collagen
does
slow
down
both
bone
and
wound
healing
zinc
is
also
another
big
player
in
bone
and
wound
healing
and
so
is
siliconin
an
undetermined
role
that
most
likely
involes
matrix
formation
and
not
transformation
of
silicon
to
calcium
for
you
to
take
this
bone
healing
observation
and
use
it
as
proof
that
silicon
is
transformed
into
calcium
is
an
interesting
little
trick
but
robert
i
have
the
same
problem
myself
when
i
read
the
lay
pressand
yes
even
some
scientific

is
the
explanation
reasonable
without
a
very
good
science
knowledge
base
you
and
most
readers
of
this
news
group
are
flying
blindyou
have
to
take
it
on
faith
because
you
dont
know
any
better
if
the
explanation
seems
to
make
sense
to
me
based
on
my
knowledge
base
im
inclined
to
consider
itthis
usually
means
trying
to
find
other
sources
that
come
to
the
same
conclusion
if
the
idealike
a
candida
bloom
seems
to
make
sense
to
me
i
tend
to
pursue
it
as
long
as
any
advice
that
im
going
to
give
isnt
going
to
really
mess
somebody
up
if
this
makes
us
kindred

robert
then
i
guess
ill
have
to
live
with
that
label
for
the
physicians
who
have
decided
to
read
my
response
to
roberts
interesting

i
hope
that
you
saw
the
segment
on
the
pediatric
neurosurgeon
last
night
on

tv
i
cant
remember
the
network
or
his
namelike
many
nights
i
was
on
my
computer
and
my
wife
was
watching
tv
in
our
den
where
i
have
my
computer
setup
this
neurosurgeon
takes
kids
with
brain
tumors
that
everyone
else
has
given
up
on
and
he
usesunconventional
treatmentshis
own
words
he
says
that
he
has
a
success
rate
the
one
case
that
i
heard
him
discussing
would
normally
use
radiationconventional

he
was
going

go
in

cut
you
guys
complain
about
the
cost
of
the
antifungals
what
do
you
think
the
cost
difference
between
radiation
treatment
and
surgery
is
guys
im
going
to
ask
you
guys
one
more
time
why
blast
a
physician
who
takes
the
chronic
sinus
suffererlike
jon
and
the
chronic
gi
suffererlike
elaine
and
tries
to
help
them
using
unconventional
treatments
treatments
which
do
not
result
in
deathlike
those
that
the
neurosurgeon
uses
is
it
because
candida
blooms
are
not
lifethreatening
while
brain
tumors
are
how
about
quality
of
life
guys
may
the
candida
demon
never
cross
your

it

you
may

well
that

not
that
accurate
people
with
early

hernias
are
felt
to
have
a
congenital
sack
that
promotes
the
formation
of
hernias
the
hernias
of
later
life
may
be
more
associated
with
chronic
straining
however
the
risk
of
damage
to
the
intestine
without
an
operation
is
high
enough
that
it
ought
to
be
repaired
the
risk
of
cancer
is
probably
no
higher
than
the
general
population
but
since
you

hi
my
wife
has
aquired
some
thyroidal
sp
deficiency
over
the
past
year
that
gives
symptoms
such
as
needing
much
sleep
coldness
and
proneness
to
gaining
weight
she
has
been
to
a
doctor
and
taken
the
ordinary
tests
and
her
values
were
regarded
as
low
the
doctor
and
my
wife
are
not
very
interested
in
starting
medication
as
this
deactivates
the
gland
giving
lifelong
dependency
to
the
drug
hormone
my
questions
are
has
anyone
hadheard
of
success
in
using
this
approach
her
values
have
been
slowly
but
steadily
sinking
any
comment
on
the
probability
of
improvement
although
the
doctor
has
told
her
to
eat
normally
my
wife
has
dieted
vigorously
to
keep
her
weight
as
she
feels
that
is
part
of
keeping
an
edge
over
the
illnesscondition
may
this
affect
the
treatment
development
there
are
several
different
types
of
thyroid
diseases
which
would
cause
a
hypothyroid
condition
reduction
in
the
output
of
the
thyroid
mainly
thyroxin
except
for
ones
caused
by
infections
the
treatment
is
generally
thyroxin
pills
hypothyroid
conditions
caused
by
infections
usually
disappear
when
the
infection
doesthis
doesnt
sound
like
the
case
with
your
wife
thyroxin
orally
does
shut
down
the
thyroid
through
a
feedback
loop
involving
the
pituitary
i
believe
the
pituitary
thinks
that
the
correct
amount
of
thyroxin
is
being
produced
so
it
doesnt
have
to
tell
the
thyroid
to
produce
more
this
process
is
reversable
i
have
hashimotos
thyroiditis
an
autoimmune
condition
and
was
on
thyroxin
for
approx
mo
when
my
endocrinologist
suggested
i
not
take
the
pills
for
wks
when
i
was
retested
for
thyroxin
levels
they
were
normal
i
still
get
tested
every
because
the
condition
might
reappear
the
pills
are
safe
and
have
very
few
sideaffects
those
mostly
at
beginning
of
treatment
having
a
baby
might
be
a
problem
and
would
at
least
require
closer
monitoring
of
hormone
levels
thyroxin
controls
energy
production
which
explains
sleepiness
coldness
and
weight
gain
there
is
also
water
retention
possibly
around
heart
changes
in
vision
and
coarser
hair
and
skin
among
other
things
i
am
not
a
doctor
so
im
sure
i
mistated
something
but
the
important
thing
is
that
thyroid
problems
are
usually
easily
corrected
and
if
they
arent
corrected
can
cause
problems
in
the
rest
of
the
body
get
a
second

out
that
what
im

has
some
support
in
the
medical
community
diet

of

for

protein
has
always
had
the
biggest
role
in
infection
and
ive
already
covered
the
role
of
protein
in
protecting
you
against
infection
now
im
going
to
hit
what
i
consider
to
be
the
most
important
nutrient
in
the
us
as
far
as
infection
is
concernedvitamin
a
when
vitamin
a
was
originally
discovered
it
was
commonly
referred
to
as
the
antiinfection
vitamin
many
peoplelinus
pauling
being
one
have
decided
to
take
this
title
away
from
vitamin
a
and
give
it
to
vitamin
c
which
ive
already
covered
big
mistakein
my
opinion
vitamin
a
is
also
getting
a
reputation
as
an
anticancer
vitaminwith
good
reason
the
nci
currently
has
numerous
clinical
trials
in
progress
to
see
if
vitamin
a
can
not
only
prevent
cancer
but
cure
it
as
well
its
role
in
both
cancer
and
infection
is
almost
identicalbut
not
quite
vitamin
a
comes
in
two
completely
different
formsretinol
and
betacarotene
retinol
is
the
animal
form
and
its
toxic
betacarotene
is
the
plant
form
and
its
completely
nontoxic
both
retinol
and
beta
carotene
display
good
absorption
in
the
human
gut
if
bile
is
present
the
liver
stores
all
of
your
retinol
and
doles
it
out
for
other
tissues
to
use
by
synthesizing
retinol
binding
proteinrbp
a
normal
human
adult
liver
should
have
to
of
retinol
stored
we
are
born
with
in
our
liver
us
autopsy
has
shown
that
about
of
americans
die
with
the
sameor
less
amount
of
vitamin
a
as
they
were
born
with
if
you
dont
believe
that
nutritional
reserveslike
that
of
retinol
in
the
liver
are
important
then
this
low
vitamin
a
reserve
is
not
going
to
affect
you
but
if
you
believelike
i
do
that
the
nutrient
reserves
are
important
then
there
is
a
problem
with
vitamin
a
in
the
us
the

vitamin

in

practice
that
they
had
better
monitor
the
serum
retinol
level
and
stop
when
there
are
clear
signs
that
the
liver
is
full
you
will
never
really
know
if
the
patient
needs
the
vitamin

you
can
not

the

but
you
will
always
know
when
its

like
in
those

pms
studies
betacarotene
can
be
taken
to
fill
up
your
liver
with
retinol
and
you
will
never
have
to
worry
about
toxicity
because
the
conversion
of
betacarotene
to
retinol
that
occurs
in
both
your
gut
and
your
liver
will
slow
downstops
in
the
liver
and
slows
down
in
the
gut
when
your
liver
is
full
of
retinol
but
taking
betacarotene
as
the
source
of
retinol
takes
a
very
long
time
to
fill
the
liver
upive
seen
estimates
of
years
if
you
are
in
the
that
only
has
as
much
as
you
were
born
with
in
your
one
other
problem
with
betacarotene
if
you
have
a
zinc
deficit
you
will
not
convert
as
much
betacarotene
to
retinol
in
the
gut
or
the
liver
because
the
enxzyme
that
does
this
conversion
requires
zinc
in
addition
the
release
of
retinol
from
the
liver
is
a
zinc
dependent
process
so
a
zinc
deficit
will
cause
a
vitamin
a
deficit
even
if
your
liver
has
plenty
of
vitamin
a
now
what
does
vitamin
a
do
in
cancer
and
infection
protection
the
body
uses
vitamin
aretinol
for
many
different
things
visionthe
first
to
be
nailed
down
and
where
you
see
overt
clinical
pathology
uses
the
aldehyde
retinal
and
alcoholretinol
form
of
vitamin
a
reproduction
uses
the
retinol
form
and
some
retinal
infection
and
cancer
protection
uses
retinoic
acid
how
do
you
convert
retinolwhich
your
white
blood
cells
and
the
mucosal
cells
get
from
blood
to
retinoic
acid
you
use
enzymes
one
of
which
requires
vitamin
cthis
is
why
pauling
has
tried
to
pull
the
title
of
antiinfection
vitamin
away
from
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
does
play
a
role
in
infectioninterferon
production
for
example
but
its
biggest
role
is
the
conversion
of
retinol
to
retinoic
acid
if
you
increase
your
intake
of
vitamin
c
you
will
increase
your
formation
of
retinoic
acid
but
retinoic
acid
can
not
be
converted
back
to
retinolas
retinal
can
and
once
its
formed
its
used
and
then
lost
to
the
body
this
is
why
the
nrc
group
wanted
to
increase
both
vitamin
c
and
vitamin
a
rdas
most
people
taking
large
amounts
of
vitamin
c
really
think
that
they
are
helping
themselves
if
they
dont
have
much
vitamin
a
in
their
liver
and
they
are
not
also
increasing
their
intake
of
vitamin
a
they
actually
do
themselves
more
harm
than
good
retinoic
acid
functions
in
white
blood
cells
to
promote
antibody
formation
in
the
mucus
membrane
it
is
the
main
factor
in
promoting
good
mucus
production
and
a
good
epithelial
cell
barrier
to
prevent
infectious
agents
from
entering
the
blood
system
the
mucus
membrane
is
referred
to
as
the
first
line
defense
against
infection
for
cancer
retinoic
acid
has
been
shown
to
act
as
a
cell
brakeit
counteracts
the
effect
of
cell
promoters
which
stimulate
cells
to
divide
cancer
has
two
distinct
steps
dna
alteration
and
cell
promotion
for
cells
that
normally
divide
all
the
time
promoters
are
not
that
important
but
for
lung
and
breast
tissue
which
does
not
normally
divide
promoters
are
real
important
in
the
malignant
process
this
is
the
major
reason
why
the
nci
has
so
many
different
clinical
trials
in
progress
using
retinol
andor
betacarotene
chronic
infectionirritation
of
the
mucus
membranes
is
a
signal
that
vitamin
a
may
not
be
adequate
i
tell
my
students
that
any
patient
who
walks
into
their
office
with
a
complaint
of
chronic
infection
has
to
be
worked
up
for
vitamin

with
the
other
factors
that
medicine
already
has
on
its
list
of
causes
for
chronic
infection

but
not

the
most
common
procedure
to
evaluate

is
to
measure
the

dark

tests

are
also
useful
but
difficult

perform
on
young

a
daily

in

for

but
do
not

for

their
toxic
serum

is
very
conservative
i
recommend
that
my
students
try
in
adults
that
are
having
problems
with
chronic
infection
they
have
to
rule
out
a
zinc
deficit
first
by
getting
an
rbc
zinc
runor
if
their

cant
run
it
i
tell
them
to
do
what
weinsier
and
morgan
suggest
give
them
the
zinc
along
with
the
vitamin
a
at
per
day
toxicity
should
not
be
a
problem
and
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
pulling
the
patient
into
the
office
on
a
regular
basis
to
run
a
serum
retinol
both
elaine
and
jon
found
doctors
who
used
a
much
higher
dose
of
vitamin
a
recall
that
the
pms
papers
were
using
to
of
vitamin
a
i
dont
suggest
that
my
students
use
these
high
doses
if
you
wanted
to
fill
the
liver
up
fastas
part
of
a
clinical
trial
and
were
monitoring
the
serum
retinol
level
then
you
would
be
okay
but
my
knowledge
of
the
vitamin
a
literature
suggests
to
me
that
for
patients
with
a
demonstrated
vitamin
a
deficitdark
adapatation
test
or
serum
retinol
will
provide
a
good
and
steady
improvementas
long
as
zinc
and
vitamin
c
status
are
good
without
having
to
worry
about
toxicity
if
they
want
to
get
more
agressive
fine
if
they
follow
my
advise
to
check
the
serum
retinol
but
vitamin
aretinol
should
never
be
given
in
high
dose
to
women
who
could
become
pregnant
since
vitamin
a
shows
teratogenicity
towards
the
human
fetus
the
dose
needed
to
show
this
effect
on
the
developing
fetus
is
of
retinol
per
day
betacarotene
will
never
have
this
effect
on
the
human
fetus
could
just
taking
betacarotene
instead
of
retinol
supplements
help
yes
but
the
effect
will
take
a
long
time
to
develop
my
advise
is
to
use
retinol
to
fill
the
liver
up
and
then
switch
to
betacarotene
to
keep
it
full
vitamin
a
is
probably
one
nutrient
that
is
better
off
left
to
prescription
by
doctors
but
when
we
have
the
mds
in
this
newsgroup
jumping
all
over
me
and
other
doctors
that
propose
the
use
of
vitamin
a
supplements
for
treating
patients
with
chronic
sinus
and
gi
distress
i
think
that
the
most
prudent
option
is
to
keep
vitamin
a
in
the
otc
market
but
require
manufactors
to
provide
package
inserts
to
educate
the
general
public

seeking
info
on
retinal
detachment
i
am
quite
near
sighted
ive
recently
received
laser
treatment
for
both
eyes
to
seal
holes
in
the
retinas
to
help
prevent
retinal
detachment
in
my
left
eye
a
small
detachment
had
begun
already
and
apparently
the
laser
was
used
to
weld
this
back
in
place
as
well
my
right
eye
seems
fine
in
my
left
eye
i
was
seeing
occasional
flashes
of
bright
light
prior
to
the
treatment
since
the
treatment
two
weeks
these
flashes
are
now
occuring
more
often
several
each
hour
the
opthamologist
explained
the
flashes
are
caused
because
the
vitreous
body
has
attached
to
the
retina
and
is
pulling
on
it
he
says
this
is
not
treatable
and
he
hopes
it
may
go
away
on
its
own
accord
if
it
tugs
enough
i
may
well
face
retinal
detachment
i
am
seeking
via
scimed
additional
info
on
retinal
detachments
the
dr
did
not
wish
to
spend
much
time
with
me
in
explanations
so
i
appreciate
any
further
details
anyone
can
provide
of
most
interest
to
me
if
my
retina
does
detach
what
should
be
my
immediate
course
of
action
if
conventional
surgery
is
need
to
repair
the
detachment
what
is
the
procedure
like
and
what
kind
of
vision
can
i
expect
afterwards
do
the
symptoms
fairly
frequent
flashes
imply
that
detachment
maybe
near
at
hand
or
is
this
not
necessarily
cause
for

i

looking

as

if
there
are
any
dangers
of
such
use
seems
safe
to
me

they
are

chronically

by

from
what
i

bz
sleep

is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep

i
seem
to
wake

be

also
i
would
be
interested
in
any
other
advice
for
helping
my
problem
although
ive
already
tried
many
of
the
nonpharmacological
solutions
well
i
think
you
might
want
to
visit
a
doctor
who
is
familiar
with
sleep
disturbances
because
antihistamines
only
help
induce
sleep
when
theyre
used
intermittently
they
lose
their
sedative
effect
if
theyre
used
on
a
nightly
basis
their
anticholinergic
effects
drying
of
secretions
relaxing
effects
on
smooth
muscle
can
be
problematic
in
some
people
such
as
those
with
glaucoma
or
prostate
enlargement
antihistamines
like
diphenhydramine
benadryl
or
doxylamine
unisom
are
potent
sedatives
which
are
useful
occasionally
chlorpheniramine
chlortrimeton
is
said
to
be
less
sedative
but
seems
to
work
well
in
some
people
both
chlorpheniramine
and
doxylamine
have
long
halflives
compared
to
diphenhydramine
and
so
may
produce

really
the
only

therapy
available
anyway
plus
its
cheap
taking
thyroid
hormone
when
it
isnt
needed
does
cause
your
thyroid
gland
to
reduce
its
own
production
of
the
hormone
but
thats
a
feature
not
a
bug
and
its
irrelevant
in
any
case
in
the
face
of
hypothyroidism
because
her
problem
that
her
gland
isnt
producing
enough
there
isnt
a
clinical
phenomenon
of
thyroid
insufficiency
caused
by
a
sudden
discontinuation
of
exogenous
thyroid
hormone
analogous
to
adrenal
insufficiency
caused
by
the
sudden
cessation
of
prolonged
administration
of

there

re

there
is
no
data
to
show
chromium
is
effective
in
promoting
weight
loss
the
few
studies
that
have
been
done
using
chromium
have
been
very
flawed
and
inher
ently
biased
the
investigators
were
making
money
from
marketing
it
theoretically
it
really
doesnt
make
sense
either
the
claim
is
that
chromium
will
increase
muscle
mass
and
decrease
fat
of
course
chromium
is
also
used
t
o
cure
diabetes
high
blood
pressure
and
increase
muscle
mass
in
athletesjust
as
well
as
anabolic
steroids
sounds
like
snake
oil
for
the
where
are
your
references
i
have
been
unable
to
find
studies
that
state
that
chromium
cures
diabetese
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
insulin
you
have
to
take
high
blood
pressure
i
have
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
anabolic
steroids
i
have
also
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
sounds
like
you
are
making
things
up
and
stretching
the
truth
for
god
knows
what
reason
did
somebody
piss
you
off
at
one
time
on
the
other
hand
it
really
cant
hurt
you
anywhere
but
your
wallet
and
place
bo
effects
of
anything
can
be
pretty
dramatic
i
agree
with
you
that
chromium
picolinate
by
itself
isnt
likely
to
make
a
fat
person
thin
but
it
can
be
the
decisive
component
of
an
overall
strategy
for
longterm
weight
control
and
make
an
important
contribution
to
good
health
it
is
important
to
exercise
and
also
avoid
fat
calories
chromium
picolinate
has
shown
to
reduce
fat
and
increase
lean
muscle
i
will
not
bore
you
with
the
statistics
you
wouldnt
believe
these
anyway
chromium
picolinate
is
an
exceptionally
bioactive
source
of
the
essential
mineral
chromium
chromium
plays
a
vital
role
in
sensitizing
the
bodys
tissues
to
the
hormone
insulin
weight
gain
in
the
form
of
fat
tends
to
impair
sensitivity
to
insulin
and
thus
in
turn
makes
it
harder
to
lose
weight
insulin
directly
stimulates
protein
synthesis
and
retards
protein
breakdown
in
muscles
this
protein
sparing
effect
of
insulin
tends
to
decline
during
low
calorie
diets
as
insulin
levels
decline
which
results
in
loss
of
muscle
and
organ
tissue
by
sensitizing
muscle
to
insulin
chromium
picolinate
helps
to
preserve
muscle
in
dieters
so
that
they
burn
more
fat
and
less
muscle
preservation
of
lean
body
mass
has
an
important
longterm
positive
effect
on
metabolic
rate
helping
dieters
keep
off
the
fat
theyve
lost
chromium
picolinate
promotes
efficient
metabolism
by
aiding
the
thermogenic
heat
producing
effects
of
insulin
insulin
levels
serve
as
a
rough
index
of
the
availability
of
food
calories
so
its
not
at
all
surprising
that
insulin
stimulates
metabolism
note
that
i
did
not
say
that
chromium
picolinate
increases
metabolism
in
summary
you
need
to
change
your
life
style
in
order
to
loose
weight
and
stay
healthy
a
reduce
dietary
fat
consumption
to
no

something

can
someone
settle

a

of
course
what
effect
would
of
these
babies
have
the
acetaminophen
is
the
agent
of
concern
in
overdose
of
this
otc
medication
a
single
dose
of
acetaminophen
of
grams
or
greater
can
cause
hepatotoxicity
and
doses
of
grams
or
more
are
potentially
fatal
from
hepatic
necrosis
if
i
recall
correctly
the
metabolism
of
acetaminophen
at
high
doses
involves
nhydroxylation
to
nacetylbenzoquinoneimine
which
is
a
highly
reactive
intermediate
which
then
reacts
with
sulfhydryl
groups
of
proteins
and
glutathione
when
hepatic
glutathione
is
used
up
this
intermediate
then
starts
attacking
the
hepatic
proteins
with
resulting
hepatic
necrosis
the
insidious
part
of
acetaminophen
toxicity
is
the
delay
days
between
ingestion
and
clinical
signs
of
liver
damage
this
is
not
a
nice
way
to
die
as
to
taking
of
these
tablets
that
comes
to
grams
of
acetaminophen
in
a
normal
adult
this
would
probably
cause
nausea
vomiting
abdominal
pain

loss

the

inject

prevent

with

come

rinse

blobs
in

you
are

diagnose
illnesses
all
over

the
two
questions
to
ask
any

therapist
are
how
does
it
work
what
evidence
is
there
the
answer
to
question
takes
a
little
knowledge

to
evaluate
i
dont

about
iridology
but
ive
read
a
book
on
reflexology
which
is
a
remarkably
similar
notion
except
that
the
organs

body
are
mapped
onto
the
soles

feet
there
are
supposed
to
be
channels
running

carrying

anatomists
have
found
no
such
structures
always
beware
the
words
channel
and
energy
in
any
spiel
put
out
by
an

the
answer
to
question
is
rather
simpler
if
all
they

is
anecdotal
evidence
then
forget
it
ask
for
referreed
papers
in
mainstream
medical
journals
ignore
any
bull
about
the
conspiracy
of
rich
doctors
suppressing
alternative

studies
are
done
and
papers
are
published
some
of
them
are
even
positive
the
word

is
an
interesting
one
licensed
by
whom
for
what
it

quite
possible

re
cats
and
pregnancy
hello
i
heard
that
a
certain
disease
toxoplasmosys
is
transmitted
by
cats
which
can
harm
the
unborn
fetus
does
anybody
know
about
it
is
it
a
problem
to
have
a
cat
in
the
same
apartment
see
the
recpetscats
faq
or
any
doctor
or
vet
for
more
information
i
am
not
any
of
the
above
but
we
do
have
a
couple
of
cats
it
is
transmitted
through
the
fecal
matter
so
a
pregnant
woman
should
avoid
cleaning
the
cat
tray
and
you
should
both
wash
hands
before
preparing
or
eating
meals
the
latter
is
sound
advice
at
any
time
of
course
apart
from
that
its
no
great
problem
you
certainly
do
not
need
to
get
rid
of
your
cats

the

one
for

persistent

i

there

there
are
two

chronic

the
actual
distinction
between
the
two
conditions
is
often
fairly
fuzzy
as
well
i
beg
to
differ
chronic
active
hepatitis
implies
that
the
disease
remains
active
and
generally
leads
to
liver
failure
at
the
very
minimum
the
patient
has
persistently
elevated
liver
enzymes
what
some
call
transaminitis
chronic
persistant
hepatitis
simply
means
that
the
patient
has
hbsag
in
hisher
blood
and
can
transmit
the
infection
but
shows
no
evidence
of
progressive
disease
if
i
had
to
choose
id
much
rather
have
the
persistant
type

ive

a
very
nice
collection
of
historical
books
on
medical
quackery

on
the
topic

massage
this
is
a
recurring
theme
ordinary
massage
is
intended
to
make
a
person
feel
better
especially
if
they
have
muscular
or
joint
problems
but
like
chiropracty
there
are
some
practitioners
who
take
the
technique
to
a
far
extreme
invoking
what
seems
to
me
to
be
quack
science
to
justify
their
technique
in
the
case
of
massage
there
is
a
technique
called
deep
abdominal
massage
in
which
the
masseur
is
literally
attempting
to
massage
the
intestines
the
notion
is
that
undigested
food
adheres
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
intestines
and
putrifies
releasing
poisons
which
cause
various
disease

procedure
it
is

that
these

can

with

they
seem
to
love
me
last
summer
i
couldnt
spend
more
than
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
at
a
time
in

before
one
or
several
wasps
would
come
for
me
i
am
asking
for
advice
on
how
to
repel
wasps
this
year
the

have
built
their
nest
under
a
stone
next
to
one
of

ponds
the
caretaker
poor
fellow
will
have
to
take
care

them
and
that
will
give

a

start

last

we
couldnt

any
nest
even
after
the
caretaker
has
gassed
the
nest
in
my
tiny
garden
of
square
meter
other
wasps
will
most
likely
vie
for
the
territory
is
there
anything
i
can
grow
rub
on
my
skin
or
spread
on
the
soil
that
will
repel
the
black
and
yellow
bastards
never
mind
if
it
turns
my
skin
purple
or
kills
off
all
my
beloved
plants
i

spend
time
in
my

everyone
else
would
it
help

ponds
and

bath
the
wasps
seem
to
come
to
drink

them
and

prey
will
breed
in
them
the
black
tits
seem

as
soon
as
the

season
starts
they
stop
coming
to
have
their
bath
even
when
i
am
not
trying
to
win
back
my
patio
from
wasps
they
seem
to
love
me
the
advice
i
usually
get
when
i
ask
what
to
do
about
wasps
is
to
stand
still

not
wave
my
arms
ive

can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
the
difference
between
a
persistent
disease
and
a
chronic
one
for
example
persistent
hepatitis
vs
chronic
hepatitis
i
dont
think
there
is
a
general
distinction
rather
there
are
two
classes
of
chronic
hepatitis
chronic
active
hepatitis
and
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
i
cant
think
of
any
other
disease
where
the
term
persistent
is
used
with
or
in
preference
to
chronic
much
as
these
two
terms
chronic
active
and
chronic
persistent
sound
fuzzy
the
actual
distinction
between
the
two
conditions
is
often
fairly
fuzzy
as
well
i
beg
to
differ
chronic
active
hepatitis
implies
that
the
disease
remains
active
and
generally
leads
to
liver
failure
at
the
very
minimum
the
patient
has
persistently
elevated
liver
enzymes
what
some
call
transaminitis
chronic
persistant
hepatitis
simply
means
that
the
patient
has
hbsag
in
hisher
blood
and
can
transmit
the
infection
but
shows
no
evidence
of
progressive
disease
if
i
had
to
choose
id
much
rather
have
the
persistant
type
being
a
chronic
hbsag
carrier
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
patient
has
chronic
persistent
anything
persons
who
are
chronic
carriers
may
have
no
clinical
biochemical
or
histologic
evidence
of
liver
disease
or
they
may
have
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
chronic
active
hepatitis
cirrhosis
or
hepatocellular
carcinoma
most
cases
of
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
cph
are
probably
the
result
of
a
viral
infection
although
in
a
good
number
of
cases
the
cause
cannot
be
determined
the
diagnosis
of
cph
is
made
on
the
basis
of
liver
biopsy
it
consists
of
findings
of
portal
inflammation
an
intact
periportal
limiting
plate
and
on
occasion
isolated
foci
of
intralobular
necrosis
but
in

to
chronic
active
hepatitis
cah
there
is
no
periportal
inflammation

cph
has
indeed
an
excellent
prognosis
if
i
had

and
cph
there
is
no

i
would
also
choose
cph
however
as
david

the

is

the

ive
got
a
very
nice
collection
of
historical
books
on
medical
quackery
and
on
the
topic
of
massage
this
is
a
recurring
theme
ordinary
massage
is
intended
to
make
a
person
feel
better
especially
if
they
have
muscular
or
joint
problems
but
like
chiropracty
there
are
some
practitioners
who
take
the
technique
to
a
far
extreme
invoking
what
seems
to
me
to
be
quack
science
to
justify
their
technique
in
the
case
of
massage
there
is
a
technique
called
deep
abdominal
massage
in
which
the
masseur
is
literally
attempting
to
massage
the
intestines
the
notion
is
that
undigested
food
adheres
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
intestines
and
putrifies
releasing
poisons
which
cause
various
disease
syndromes
by
this
vigorous
and
painful
procedure
it
is
alleged
that
these
deposits
can
be
loosened
up
and
passed
out
i
just
cant
believe
this
idea
has
any
truth
behind
it
the
human
intestine
is
not
a
new

city
sewer
pipe

even
if

as

there
is
a
small

a

any

at
all
with
it
my
friend
has
been
diagnosed
as
having
a
severe
case
of
depression
requiring
antidepressants
for
a
cure
the
main
problem
is
the
side
effects
of
these
so
far
she
has
been
prescribed
prozac
aurorix
and
tryptanol
all
with
different
but
unbearable
side
effects
the
prozac
gave
very
bad
anxietyjitters
and
insomina
it
was
impossible
to
sit
still
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
the
aurorix
whilst
having
a
calming
effect
all
feelings
were
lost
and
the
body
coordination
was
similar
to
a
drunken
person
her
brain
was
clouded
over
the
tryptanol
gave
tremors
in
the
legs
and
panic
attacks
along
with
unco
ordination
occurred
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
as
her
brain
was
closed
down
has
anyone
had
similar
problems
andor
have
any
suggestions
as
to
the
next
step

would
end
up
getting

in

first
place
my
understanding
and
feel
free
to
correct
me
is
that
the
enzymes
are
at
worst
mildly
elevated
with
overall
normal
hepatic
function
i
would
think
that
the
only
clue
might
be

and
a

is
it

of
the
people
taking
zoloft
have
to
discontinue
it
because
of
side
effects
the
only
problem
im
having
is
some
minor
gi
distress
but
nothing
too
annoying
hopefully
the
zoloft
will
work
maybe
your
friend
should
try
this
one
next
my
psychiatrists
strategy
seems
to
be
to
first
try
one
of
the
serotonin
drugs
usually
prozac
if
that
works
great
if
it
works
but
has
too
many
side
effects
try
zoloft
or
maybe
paxil
if
the
serotonin
drugs
dont
work
at
all
try
one
of
the
tricyclics
like
desipramine
suggestions
as
to
the
next
step
having
a
doctor
who
knows
something
about
antidepressants
can
make
a
big
difference
my
psychiatrist
claims
that
most
gps
and
fps
dont
have
much
experience
in
this
area
and
from
what
ive
seen
im
inclined
to
believe
him
i
think
i
know
more
about
antidepressants
than
the

at
my

is
that

chronic

after

the

transaminases
can
be
trivial

other

chemistries
are

patients

chronic

can

that

lowers

tend

reinnoculation

needed
to

health
effects
of
this
depletion

is
a
very
hotly
debated
topic
in
the
medical
community
with
most
physicians
seeming
to
discount
any
health
effects
of
chronic
antibiotic
use
a
view
that
i
do
not
support
how
does
one
tell
if
a

more
susceptible

illness
than
normal
and
what
does
one
do
about
it
chronic
infection
in
an
adult
or
a
child
needs
to
be
worked
up
in
my
opinion
but
most
physicians
feel
that
chronic
infection
in
a
child
is
normal
because
of
both
exposure
and
lack
of
prior
immunity
to
many
infectious
diseases
i
do
not
share
this
view
and
there
are
some
physicians
who
also
suspect
that
diet
plays
a
big
role
in
infection
frequency
and
severity
exposure
to
an
infectious
agent
does
not
have
to
result
in
a
severe
infection
a
strong
immune
response
can
minimize
the
length
of
time
needed
to
deal
with
the
infection
as
well
as
the
symptoms
associated
with
the
infection
is
there
any
way
to
build
immunity
and
resistance
there
are
five
major
nutrients
that
are
responsible
for
a
good
strong
immune
response
to
infectious
agents
they
are
protein
vitamin
c
vitamin
a
iron
and
zinc
the
american
diet
is
not
low
in
protein
so
this
is
rarely
a
problem
but
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
iron
and
zinc
are
often
low
and
this
lack
of
an
adequate
poolnutrient
reserve
can
impair
the
immune
response
iron
is
know
to
be
low
in
most
kidsas
is
vitamin
a
there
are
distinct
biochemical
tests
that
can
be
run
to

status
of
each
of
these
nutrients
in

patient
who
is

i

nutrients
and
their
role
in

for
this
news
group
as
well

the
others
that
i
participate
in
i
can
email
you
what
ive
worked
up
so
far
but
my
best
advice
to
you
is
to
try
to
find
a
physician
who
recognizes
the
critical
role
that
diet
plays
in
the
human
immune
response
you
may
also
be
able
to
get
help
from
a
nutritionist
anyone
can
call
themselves
a
nutritionist
so
you
have
to
be
very
carefull
you
want
to
find
someone
like
myself
who
has
had
some
formal
training
and
education
in
nutrition
many
phd
programs
in
the
us
now
offer
degrees
in
nutrition
and
thats
what
you
need
to
look
for
some
dieticians
will
also
call
themselves
nutritionists
but
most
dieticians
have
not
had
the
biochemical
training
needed
to
run
specialized
nutritional
assessment
tests
they
are
very
good
for
getting
general
dietary
advice
from
however
any
data
information
or

relating

this
would
be

that

exist
then
the
fact
that
some

has
been
refuted
by
the

doesnt
hold
much
weight
as
for
the

of

the
fact
that
the

didnt
find

effective
doesnt
make

here
of
course
they
didnt
i
tend
to
have

of
the

who
are

alive

being
told

that
they
would

of

soon
they
are
fighting
like
hell
to
keep
that

open

they
credit
his

with
their

anyone
who
looks
at
the

easily
see

he
was
at

for
the
first

and
he
did
not

even
once

it
seems
like
he
has
some
sort
of
cold
or
flu
pretty
much
once
a

most
of
the
time
the
cold
leads
to
an
ear
infection
as
well
with
the
result
that
he
ends
up
being
on

weeks
out
of
i
know
kids
in

fall
sick
more
often
but
we
sounds
pretty
familiar
i
posted
similar
cries
about
last
september
when
caroline
just
entered
daycare
she
was
two
then
and
have
been
with
continuous
colds
since
until
last
march
as
spring
approaches
her
colds
slowed
down
meanwhile
we
grew
more
and
more
relaxed
about
her
colds
only
once
did
the
doctor
diagnosed
an
ear
infection
and
only
twice
she
had
antibiotics
the
other
time
was
due
to
sinus
infection
and
i
wished
that
i
did
not
give
her
that
awful
septra
are
there
any
studies
that
can
help
answer
some
of
these
questions
there
are
the
net
studies
that
is
if
you
read
this
newsgroup
often
there
will
be
a
round
of
questions
like
this
every
month
there
might
be
formal
studies
like
that
but
bear
with
my
not
so
academic
experience
okay
how
often
do
kids
in
their
first
second
and
third
years
fall
sick
how
often
do
they
get
colds
flus
ear
infections
gee
i
bet
youll
hear
cases
in
all
these
catagories
is
there
any
data
on
home
care
vs
day
care
i
am
pretty
sure
an
insulated
child
at
home
sicks
less
but
that
child
still
will
face
the
world
one
day
does
being
sick
build
immunity
leading
to
less
illness
later
thats
what
i
believe
and
comfort
myself
with
caroline
will
get
more
and
more
colds
for
sure
before
she
learned
not
to
stick
her
hand
in
other
kids
mouth
nor
let
other
kids
do
the
same
cold
virus
mutate
easily
however
i
hope
that
her
immune
system
will
be
stronger
to
fight
these
diseases
so
she
would
be
less
severely
affected
everytime
she
has
a
cold
we
make
sure
she
blow
her
nose
frequently
and
give
her
dorcol
or
dimetapp
at
night
so
she
can
have
good
rest
thanks
to
some
suggestions
from
the
net
thats
about
all
the
care
she
needs
from
us
i
try
very
hard
to
keep
her
off
antibiotics
twice
her
ped
gave
me
choice
to
decide
whether
she
would
have
antibiotics
i
waited
just
long
enough
days
to
see
that
she
fought
the
illness
off
i
do
understand
that
you
dont
have
much
choice
if
the
child
is
in
pain
andor
high
fever
does
it
make
kids
weaker
leading
to
more
illness
later
or
does
it
not
have
any
long
term
effect
if
the
child
doesnt
rely
on
antibiotics
to
fight
off
the
sickness
everytime
then
the
child
should
be
stronger
does
taking
antibiotics
on
a
regular
basis
have
any
negative
long

effects
ill
leave
this
to

how
does
one
tell
if
a

is
more
susceptible
to
illness
than
normal
and
what
does

do
about

im

the

will

hi
all
my
skin
is

in
general
but
the
most
serious
part
is
located
from
knees
down
the
skin
there
looks
like
segmented
the
segmentation
actually
happens
beneath
the
skin
i
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
any
cure
for
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
just
saw
a
dermatologist
the
other
day
and
while
i
was
there
i
asked
him
about
dry
skin
id
been
spending
a
small
fortune
on
various
creams
lotions
and
other
dry
skin
treatments
he
said
all
i
needed
was
a
large
jar
of
vaseline
soak
in
a
lukewarm
tub
of
water
for
minutes
only
minutes
then
massage
in
the
vaseline
to
trap
the
moisture
in
that
is
the
standard
advice
in
dermatology
texts
the
soak
part
greatly
increases
the
inconvenience
dont
bother
unless
it
doesnt
work
otherwise
the
hard
part
will
be
finding
the
time
to
rub
in
the
vaseline
properly
exactly
but
it
adds
to
the
ritual
aspect
which
is
important
for
us
suggestible
patients
posters
dont
bother
to
repeat
the
rationale
for
the
soak
if
its
not
done
right
you
remain
greasy
and
stick
greasy
no
matter
what
vaseline
generically
petrolatum
is
famous
for
that
one
text
states
that
the
more
greasy
a
dryskin
cream
is
the
more
effective
try
it
its
got
to
be
cheaper
then
spending
for
oz
of
natural
lotion
try
usp
lanolin
at
least
for
maintenance
preventive
therapy
usp
lanolin
is
natural
and
much
less
greasy
and
cheap
dont
buy
the
more
expensive
perfumed
lanolin
mixture
as
ive
commented
before
petrolatum
is
a
poorly
characterized
mixture
of
hydrocarbons
which
are
not
found
in

systems
that
is

the
it
is
currently
selling
for
no
they

well
my
doctor
started
using
one
recently
and
i
thought
the
concept
was
so
amazing
that
i
bought
one
too
the
thing
works
by
reading
the
infrared
emissions
from
the
ear
drum
the
ear
drum
is
hotter
than
the
ear
canal
walls
so
you
have
to
point
the
thing
very
carefully
this
means
tugging
on
the
top
of
the
ear
to
straighten
out
the
ear
canal
then
inserting
the
thing
snugly
then
pushing
a
button
unfortunately
there
are
many
things
that
can
go
wrong
it
is
almost
impossible
to
aim
the
thing
correctly
when
you
do
it
on
yourself
i
get
readings
which
differ
from
each
other
by
up
to
degrees
and
may
differ
from
an
oral
thermometer
by
up
to
degrees
i
talked
to
one
of
the
nurses
in
my
doctors
office
recently
about
this
and
she
said
she
didnt
like
them
either
for
same
reasons
she
did
give
me
some
instruction
on
how
to
tug
on
my
ear
and
what
correct
insertion
feels
like
but
she
said
she
thought
it
was
impossible
to
do
correctly
on
ones
self
she
also
said
that
she
and
other
nurses
had
complained
to
the
company
about
inaccurate
readings
and
that
someone
from
the
company
had
told
them
to
take
great
care
to
clean
the
infrared
window
at
the
end
of
the
probe
with
alcohol
from
time
to
time
she
demonstrated
this
prior
to
reading
my
temperature
and
managed
to
get
a
reading
within
degree
of
the
oral
temperature
i
took
at
home
before
driving
to
the
drs
office
i
have
also
noticed
tha
some
nurses
click
the
button
then
remove
the
probe
immediately
this
causes
wrong
readings
in
my
experience
you
have
to
leave
the
probe
in
a
good
to
seconds
after
clicking
the
button
to
get
a
good
measurement
the
nurse
i

with

i
suspect
that
many
people
dont
realize
this
and
therefore
get
bad
readings
for
yet
another
reason
in
short
its

great
idea
it
may

chronic
persistent
hepatitis
is
usually
diagnosed
when
someone
does
a
liver
biopsy
on
a
patient
that
has
persistently
elevated
serum
transaminases
months
after
a
bout
of
acute
viral
hepatitis
or
when
someone
is
found
to
have
persistently
elevated
transaminases
on
routine
screening
tests
the
degree
of
elevation
in
the
serum
transaminases
can
be
trivial
or
as
much
as
ten
times
normal
other
blood
chemistries
are
usually
normal
as
a
rule
patients
with
cph
have
no
clinical
signs
of
liver
disease
chronic
active
hepatitis
can
also
be
asymptomatic
or
minimally
symptomatic
at
least
initially
and
thats
why
its
important
to
tell
them
apart
by
means
of
a
biopsy
the
patient
with
cph
only
needs
to
be
reassured
the
patient
with
cah
needs
to
be
treated
i
just
went
back
to
the
chapter
in
cecil
on
chronic
hepatitis
it
seems
that
indeed
most
cases
of
cph
are
persistant
viral
hepatitis
whereas
there
are
a
multitude
of
potential
and
probable
causes
for
cah
viral
drugs
alcohol
autoimmune
etc
physicians
seem
to
have
a
variety
of
thresholds
for
electing
to
biopsy
someones
liver
personally
i
think
that
if
the
patient
is
asymptomatic
with
only
slight
transaminitis
and
normal
albumin
and
pt
one
can
simply
follow
them
closely
and
not
add
the
potential
risks
of
a
biopsy
others
may
well
biopsy
such
a
patient
thus
providing
these
samples
for
study
it
would
be
interesting
to

a

had
several

and
we
never

figure

had
each

one
might
ask

this
happened
my

were
by
the

they
reached

quite
prosperous
farmers
nonetheless
they
lost

you

in

with
the
presence
of
ketones

a
friend
of
mine
has
a
very
severe
cause
of
jiggers
for
over
a
year
now
they
cause
him
a
lot
of
pain
i
recently
read
i
dont
know
where
about
a
possible
cure
for
jiggers
does
anyone
have
any
information
on
this
i
cant
remember
the
name
of
the
treatment
or
where
i
read
it
ill
probably
get
flamed
for
this
but
when
i
was
a
kid
we
would
go
to
my
uncles
cabin
on
middle
bass
island
on
lake
erie
we
always
came
home
with
a
nasty
case
of
jiggers
large
red
bumps
where
the
buggers
had
burrowed
into
the
skin
my
mother
would
paint
the
bumps
with
clear
finger
nail
polish
this
was
repeated
daily
for
about
a
week
or
so
the
application
of
the
polish
is
supposed
to
suffocate
them
as
it
seals
of
the
skin
all
i
can
say
is
it
worked
for
us
one
word
of
caution
though
putting
finger
nail
polish
on
a
jigger
bite
stings
like
hell
if
i
do
get
flamed
for

put

my

has
the
usual
teenage
spotty
chin
and
greasy

i
bought
him
clearasil

wash

ointment
i
think
that
is
probably
enough
along
with
the
usual
good
diet
however
he
is
on

to

product

used

only

i
have
asked
a

of

who
say
either
his
acne
is
not
severe
enough
for
dalacin
t
or
that
clearasil
is
ok
i
had
the
odd
spots
as
a
teenager
nothing
serious
his
father
was
the
same
so
i
dont
figure
his
acne
is
going
to
escalate
into
something
disfiguring
but
i
know
kids
are
senstitive
about
their
appearance
i
am
wary
because
a
neighbours
son
had
this
wierd
malady
that
was
eventually
put
down
to
an
overdose
of
vitamin
a
from
acne
treatment
i
want
to
help
but
with
appropriate
treatment
my
son
also
has
some
scaliness
around
the
hairline
on
his
scalp
sort
of
teenage
cradle
cap
any
pointersadvice
on
this
we
have
tried
a
couple

anti

some
of

are

make

since

that
since
this
is
a
relatively
new
disorder
first
documented
in

in
scandanavia
and
is
therefore
controversial
i
do
not

a

about
this

from
seeing
one
patient
with
kartageners
syndrome
which
is
a
form
of
immotile
cilia
syndrome
in
which
there
is
situs

bronchiectasis
and
chronic
infections
situs
inversus
means
that
organs
are
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
body
and
can
be
complete
or
partial
it
is
interesting
medically
because
the
normal
location
of
organs
is
caused
in

by
the
normal
rotation
associated
with
ciliary
motion
so
that
in
absence
of
this
laterality
can
be
random
people
with
situs

are
quite
popular
at
medical

of
their
rarity
and
the
fact
that
most
doctors
get
a

upset

they

theyre
on

according
to
harrisons
immotile
cilia
syndrom
is
an
autosomal
recessive

should
imply
that
on

one

can
anyone
out

enlighten
me
on
the
relationship
between
lung

swelling

widening
of
the
fingertips
what
is
the
mechanism
and
why
would
a
physician
call
for
chest
xrays
to
diagnose
the
cause
of
the
clubbing
purists
often
distinguish
between
true
clubbing
and
pseudo
clubbing
the
difference
being
that
with
true
clubbing
the
angle
of
the
nail
when
viewed
from
the
side
is
constantly
negative
when
proceeding
distally
towards
the
fingertip
with
pseudo
clubbing
the
angle
is
initially
positive
then
negative
which
is
the
normal
situation
real
internists
can
talk
for
hours
about
clubbing
im
limited
to
a
couple
of
minutes
whether
this
distinction
has
anything
to
do
with
reality
is
entirely
unclear
but
it
is
one
of
those
things
that
internists
love
to
paw
over
during
rounds
supposedly
only
true
clubbing
is
associated
with
disease
the
problem
is
that
the
list
of
diseases
associated
with
clubbing
is
quite
long
and
includes
both
congenital
conditions
and
acquired
disease
since
many
of
these
diseases
are
associated
with
cardiopulmonary
problems
leading
to
right
to
left
shunts
and
chronic
hypoxemia
it
is
very
reasonable
to
get
a
chest
xray
however
many
of
the
congenital
abnormalities
would
only
be
diagnosed
with
a
cardiac
catheterization
the
cause
of
clubbing
is
unclear
but
presumably
relates
to
some
factor
causing
blood
vessels
in
the
distal
fingertip
to
dilate
abnormally
clubbing
is
one
of
those
things
from
an
examination
which
is
a
tipoff
to
do
more
extensive
examination
often
however
the
cause
of
the
clubbing
is
quite
apparent

quickly
there
are
many
organisms
viral

which
can

the
course

varies

the
causes
of
bacterial
meningitis
vary
with
age
in
adults
pneumococcus
the
same
organism
which
causes
pneumococcal
pneumonia
is
the
most
common
cause
while
in
children
hemophilus

is
the
most
common

what
you

is
meningitis
from
neisseria
meningitidis
which
is
the
second
most
common
cause
of
bacterial
meningitis
in
both
groups
but
with
lower
incidence
in
infants
this
organism
is
also
called
the
meningococcus
and
is
the
source
of
the
common
epidemics
of
meningitis
that
occur
and
are
popularized
in
the
press
without
prompt
treatment
and
even
with
it
in
some
cases
the
organism
typically
causes
death
within
a
day
this
organism
feared
as
it
is
is
actually
grown
from
the
throats
of
many
normal
adults
it
can
get
to
the
meninges
by
different
ways
but
blood
borne
spread
is
probably
the
usual
case
rifampin
an
oral
antibiotic
is
often
given

i
just
read
an
interesting
tidbit
that
of
the
medical
treatments
are
unproven
and
not
based
on
scientific
fact
for
example
many
treatments
of
prostate
cancer
are
unproven
and
the
treatment
may
be
more
dangerous
than
the
disease
according
to
the
article
i
read
where
did
you
read
this
i
dont
think
this
is
true
i
think
most
medical
treatments
are
based
on
science
although
it
is
difficult
to
prove
anything
with

it
is

that
there
are

we
have
no

for
why
but
almost
everything
does
have

the
most

for

cancer
is
probably
hormone
therapy

subject
re
sinus
vs
migraine
was
re
sinus
endoscopy
i
noticed
several
years
ago
that
when
i
took
analgesics
fairly
regularly
motrin
at
the
time
i
seemed
to
get
a
lot
of
migraines
but
had
forgotten
about
that
until
i
started
reading
some
of
the
posts
here
i
generally
dont
take
nsaids
or
tylenol
for
headaches
because
ive
found
them
to
be
ineffective
however
i
have
two
other
pain
sources
that
force
me
to
take
nsaids
currently
naprosyn
first
is
some
pelvic
pain
that
i
get
at
the
beginning
of
my
period
and
then
much
worse
at
midcycle
i
have
had
surgery
for
endometriosis
in
the
past
years
ago
so
the
drs
tell
me
that
my
pain
is
probably
due
to
the
endometriosis
coming
back
ive
tried
synarel
it
reduced
the
pain
while
i
took
it
mos
but
the
pain
returned
immediately
after
i
stopped
three
doctors
have
suggested
hysterectomy
as
the
only
real
solution
to
my
problem
although
i
dont
expect
to
have
any
more
children
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
having
my
uterus
and
one
remaining
ovary
removed
the
first
ovary
was
removed
when
i
had
the
surgery
for
endometriosis
one
of
the
drs
that
suggested
i
get
a
hysterectomy
is
an
expert
in
laser
surgery
but
perhaps
thinks
that
type
of
procedure
is
only
worthwhile
on
women
who
still
plan
to
have
children
so
basically
all
im
left
with
is
toughing
out
the
pain
this
would
be
impossible
without
naprosyn
or
something
similar
but
not
aspirin
that
doesnt
work
and
motrin
gave
me
horrible
gastritis
a
few
years
ago
so
im
through
with
it
in
fact
naprosyn
works
very
well
at
eliminating
the
pain
if
i
take
it
regularly
as
i
did
when
i
had
severe
back
pain
and
pain
in
both
legs
as
ill
discuss
in
a
moment
generally
though
i
wait
until
i
have
the
pain
before
i
take
the
naprosyn
but
then
it
takes
several
hours
for
it
reduce
the
pain
its
actually
quite
effective
at
reducing
the
pain
it
just
takes
quite
a
while
in
the
meantime
im
frequently
in
severe
pain
the
other
pain
source
i
have
is
chronic
lower
back
pain
resulting
in
bilateral
radiculopathy
ive
had
mris
xrays
ct
scan
and
emgs
ive
had
of
them
and
dont
intend
to
ever
do
that
again
with
nerve
conduction
tests
the
tests
have
not
been
conclusive
as
to
what
is
causing
my
back
and
leg
pain
the
mri
reports
both
say
i
have
several
bulging
degeneratig
disks
and
from
the
xrays
and
mri
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
i
have
arthritis
the
reading
on
the
ct
scan
was
that
there
are
two
herniations
and
but
others
hav
looked
at
the
films
and
concluded
that
there
are
no
herniations
the
second
emg
and
nerve
conduction
studies
shows
significant
denervation
compared
to
the
first
emg
oh
yeah
i
had
some
other
horrible
test
called
something
like
somatic
evoked
response
which
showed
that
the
internal
nerves
are
working
fine
anyway
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
sometimes
have
severe
pain
in
both
legs
and
back
pain
the
back
pain
is
there
all
the
time
but
i
can
live
with
it
when
the
leg
pain
is
there
i
need
some
analgesicantiinflammatory
medication
to
reduce
the
pain
to
a
level
where
i
can
work
so
i
took
naprosyn
regulary
for
months
every
time
i
tried
to
stop
the
leg
pain
got
worse
so
id
always
resume
since
last
november
i
have
taken
it
much
less
frequently
and
primarily
for
the
pelvic
pain
i
have
been
going
to
physical
therapy
for
the
last
months
times
a
week
after
the
first
month
or
so
my
therapist
put
me
on
pelvic
traction
she
had
tried
it
earlier
but
it
had
caused
a
lot
of
pain
in
my
back
this
time
she
tried
it
at
a
lower
weight
after
a
month
or
two
the
pain
in
my
legs
began
going
away
but
the
traction
aways
caused
discomfort
in
my
lower
back
which
could
be
reduced
with
ultrasound
and
massage
so
now
i
dont
have
nearly
as
much
pain
in
my
legs
in
fact
my
therapist
took
me
off
traction
about
weeks
ago
getting
back
to
my
original
reason
for
this
post
even
if
i
can
avoid
taking
analgesic
for
headaches
i
really
cant
avoid
them
entirely
because
i
have
other
pain
sources
that
force
me
to
use
them
oh
i
forgot
to
mention
that
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
i
have
back
surgery
but
im
avoiding
that
too
i
find
the
migraines
difficult
to
deal
with
occassionally
i
have
to
take
off
work
but
usually
i
can
work
but
at
a
reduced
capacity
im
a
systems
engineer
and
do
a
lot
of
reading
and
writing
when
the
pelvic
pain
is
bad
i
cant
concentrate
much
i
usually
end
up
jumping
out
of
my
chair
every
few
minutes
because
the
pain
is
so
bothersome
when
the
pain
in
my
back
is
bad
it
can
cause
severe
burning
in
both
legs
shooting
pains
in
my
legs
electric
shock
type
of
pain
in
my
feet
and
toes
and
basically
when
it
gets
bad
i
cant
really
sit
at
all
then
i
end
up
spending
most
of
my
time
home
and
in
bed
so
even
if
the
analgesics
contribute
to
the
migraines
the
migraines
are
more
tolerable
than
the
other
pain
sources
i
get
a
lot
of
migraines
an
average
of
to
a
month
which
last
days
ive
taken
cafergot
the
first
time
the
caffiene
really
got
to
me
so
i
reduced
the
dosage
but
i
dont
like
the
side
effects
if
i
take
more
than
two
i
get
diahrea
if
i
get
a
very
bad
headache
i
will
eventually
take
the
cafergot
my
neurologist
wasnt
very
helpful
when
i
told
him
my
problems
with
cafergot
he
said
that
when
sumatriptan
becomes
available
i
should
try
that
ive
tried
several
other
medications
fiornal
midrin
fiornal
with
codeine
tegretol
and
inderal
but
they
either
didnt
work
or
i
couldnt
tolerate
them
so
what
can
i
do
my
doctors
seem
to
be
satisfied
with
me
just
trying
to
tolerate
the
pain
which
i
agree
with
most
of
the
time
but
not
when
i
have
a
lot
of
pain
ive
had
some
bad
experiences
with
surgery
my
heart
stopped
once
from
the
anesthesia
i
was
told
that
it
was
likely
the
succinylcholine
and
ive
already
had
surgery
several
times
anyway
the
point
of
what
im
saying
is
that
even
if
analgesics
can
contribute
to
migraines
some
people
need
to
take
them
to
tolerate
other
pain

nothing
serious
his

i

his

is
going
to
escalate
into
something
disfiguring

i
know
kids
are
senstitive
about
their

the

i
may
not
be
the
worlds
greatest
expert
on
chiggers
a
type
of
mite
indigenous
to
the
south
but
i
certainly
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
contemplating
the
little
buggers
over
the
past
six
years
since
we
moved
to
nc
here
are
some
observations
gained
from
painful
experience
reactions
to
chiggers
vary
greatly
from
person
to
person
some
people
get
tiny
red
bites
others
like
me
are
more
sensitive
and
get
fairly
large
swollen
sorelike
affairs
chigger
bites
are
the
gift
that
keeps
on
giving
i
swear
that
these
things
will
itch
for
months
there
is
a
lot
of
folklore
about
chiggers
i
think
most
of
it
is
fiction
i
have
tried
to
do
research
on
the
critters
since
they
have
such
an
effect
on
me
the
only
book
i
could
find
on
the
subject
was
a
single
book
in
uncs
special
collections
library
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
what
is
required
to
get
it
based
on
my
experience
and
that
of
my
family
members
the
old
folk
remedy
of
fingernail
polish
simply
doesnt
work
i
recall
reading
that
the
theory
upon
which
it
is
based
that
the
chiggers
burrow
into
your
skin
and
continue
to
party
there
is
false
i
think
it
is
more
likely
that
the
reaction
is
to
toxins
of
some
sort
the
little
pests
release
but
this
is
speculation
the
best
approach
is
prevention
a
couple
of
things
work
well
a
good
insect
repellent
deet
such
as
deep
woods
off
liberally
applied
to
ankles
waistband
etc
is
a
good
start
there
is
another
preparation
called
chig
away
that
is
a
combination
of
sulfur
and
some
kind
of
cream
cortisone
that
originally
was
prepared
for
the
army
and
is
not
commercially
available
in
the
summer
i
put
this
on
my
ankles
every
morning
when
i
get
up
on
weekends
since
i
literally
cant
go
outside
where
we
live
in
the
country
without
serious
consequences
they
apparently
dont
like
sulfur
much
at
all
you
can
use
sulfur
as
a
dust
on
your
body
or
clothing
to
repel
them
no
amount
of
prevention
will
be
completely
successful
forget
the
fingernail
polish
i
have
finally
settled
upon
a
treatment
that
involves
topical
application
of
a
combination
of
cortisone
creme
reduces
the
inflamation
and
swelling
and
benzocaine
relieves
the
itch
i
wont
tell
you
all
the
things
ive
tried
nor
will
i
tell
you
some
of
the
things
my
wife
does
since
this
counts
as
minor
surgery
and
is
best
not
mentioned
i
also
think
it
gains
nothing
the
swelling
and
itching
can
also
be
significantly
relieved
by
the
application
of
hot
packs
and
this
seems
to
speed
recovery
as
well
doctors
seem
not
to
care
much
about
chiggers
the
urban
and
suburban
doctors
apparently
dont
encounter
them
much
and
the
rural
doctors
seem
to
regard
them
as
a
force
of
nature
that
one
must
endure
i
suspect
that
anyone
who
could
come
up
with
a

this

the

our

xenografts
done

transplants
from

i
must
confess
to
a
total
ignorance
of
that

we
are
philosophically

to
those

natural
anticanceraids
remedies
the
biggest
reason
why
the
cost
of
medical
care
is
so
extremely
high
and
increasing
is
that
natural
methods
of
treatment
and
even
diagnosis
are
still
being
systematically
ignored
and
suppressed
by
the
moneygrubbing
and
power
mongering
medical
establishment

examples
of
very
low

natural
anticancer
remedies

take
a

which
is
also
an
excellent
daily

against
the

because
it
kills
all

preferably
distilled

apply

several
times
per

use
hydrogenperoxide
only
if
you
are
taking
a
good
daily
dose
of
some
of
the
various
antioxidants
described
above
vitamin
mineral
supplements
are
more
effective
and
much
less
expensive
when
combined
together
in
mega
doses
into
single

cancer
cells
can

in
a
strong
maxwell
north
magnetic
field
especially
if
it
is
pulsating
on
and
off
a
strong
south
magnetic
field
is
an
aphrodisiac
in
my
opinion
all
types
of
ionizing
radiation
treatments
for
cancer
should
be
replaced
with
daily
doses
of
pulsating
north
magnetic
fields
properly
made
and
operated
radionicspsionics
machines
can
both
diagnose
and
cure
all
forms
of

trouble
this
list
is
not
exhaustive
the
above
natural
remedies
can
cure
both
diagnosed
and
un
diagnosed
cancers
as
well
as
prevent
them
and
also
prevent
and
cure
many
other
medical
problems
including
heart
diseases
they
are
not
too
simple
and
inexpensive
to
work
effectively
besides
acting
on
a
person
biologically
and
chemically
these
remedies
especially
the
fast
and
the
grape
diet
send
a
strong
message
to
ones
subconscious
mind
programming
it
to
cure
the
cancer
in
my
opinion
if
a
person
finds
out
that
she
has
cancer
then
she
should
promptly
try
at
least
the
first
remedies
described
above
in
sequence
starting
with
the
fast
before
resorting
to
the

anybody
hear
anything

the

i

unlucky
the

nothing
new

around
for

my
biggest
resentment
is
the
doctor
who
makes
it
seem
like
most
people
with
dizziness
can
be
cured
thats
definitely
not
the
case
in
most
cases
like
i
said
above
it
is
a
long
tedious
process
that
may
or
may
not
end
up
in
a
partial
cure
be
sure
to
say
chronic
dizziness
not
just
dizziness
most
patients
with
acute
or
subacute
dizziness
will
get
better
the
vertiginous
spells
of
menieres
will
also
eventually
go
away
however
the
patient
is
left
with
a
deaf
ear
all
true
and
all
good
points
to
anyone
suffering
with
vertigo
dizziness
or
any
variation
thereof
my
best
advice
to
you
as
a
fellowsufferer
is
this
just
keep
searchingdont
let
the
doctors
tell
you
theres
nothing
that
can
be
donedo
your
own
researchand
let
your
this
may
have
helped
you
but
im
not
sure
it
is
good
general
advice
the
odds
that
you
are
going
to
find
some
miracle
with
your
own
research
that
is
secret
or
hidden
from
general
knowledge
for
this
or
any
other
disease
are
slim
when
good
answers
to
these
then
spending
a
great
deal
of
time
and
energy
on
the
medical
problem
may
divert
that
energy
from
more
productive
things
in
life
a
limited
amount
should
be
spent
to
assure
yourself
that
your
doctor
gave
you
the
correct
story
but
after
it
becomes
clear
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
problem
for
which
medicine
has
no
good
solution
perhaps
the
best
strategy
is
to
join
the
support
group
and
keep
abreast
of
new
findings
but
not
to
make
a
career
out
of
it
well
making
a
career
out
of
it
is
a
bit
strong
i
still
believe
that
doing
your
own
research
is
very
very
necessary
i
would
not
have
progressed
as
much
as
i
have
today
unless
i
had
spent
the
many
hours
in
stanfords
med
library
as
i
have
done
and
years
ago
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
medicine
that
would
help
me
so
should
i
have
stopped
searching
thank
goodness
i
didnt
now
i
found
that
there
is
indeed
medicine
that
helps
me
i
think
that
what
youve
said
is
kind
of
idealistic
that
you
would
go
to
one
doctor
get
a
diagnosis
maybe
get
a
second
opinion
and
then
move
on
with
your
life
just
as
an
example
having
seen
of
the
top
specialists
in
this
field
in
the
country
i
have
received
different
diagnoses
these
are
the
top
names
the
ones
that
people
come
to
from
all
over
the
country
i
have
had
to
sort
all
of
this
out
myself
going
to
a
support
group
and
in
fact
heading
that
support
group
was
helpful
for
a
while
but
after
a
point
i
found
it
very
unproductive
it
was
much
more
productive
to
do
library
research
make
phone
calls
and
put
together
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
myself
a
recent
movie
lorenzos
oil
offers
a
perfect
example
of
what
im
talking
about
if
you
havent
seen
it
you
should
its
not
a
put
down
of
doctors
and
neither
is
what
im
saying
doctors
are
only
human
and
can
only
do
so
much
but
there
are
those
of
us
out
here
who
are
intelligent
and
able
to
sometimes
find
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
that
might
have
otherwise
gone
unnoticed
i
guess
im
biased
because
dizziness
is
one
of
those
weird
things
that
is
still
so
unknown
if
i
had
a
broken
arm
or
a
weak
heart
or
failing
kidneys
i
might
not
have
the
same
opinion
thats
because
those
things
are
much
more
tangible
and
have
much
more
concise
definitions
and
treatments
with
dizziness
you
just
have
to
decide
to
live
with
it
or
decide
to
live
with
it
while
trying
to
find
your
way
out
of

if
youve
got
a

computer
which
uses

sun
hp
dec
etc
then
youre
going
to
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
vendor
to
sell
you
a
compatible
keyboard
if
your
workstation
runs
the
x
window
system
youre
in
luck
you
can
buy
a
cheap
used
pc
hook
your
expensive
keyboard
up
to
it
and
run
a
serial
cable
to
your
workstation
then
run
a
program
on
the
workstation
to
read
the
serial
port
and
generate
fake
x
keyboard
events
the
two
main
programs
ive
found
to
do
this
are
kt
and
is
a
sophisticated
program
capable
of
controlling
the
mouse
and
even
moving
among
widgets
on
the
screen
it
requires
a
server
extension
xtest
decxtrap
or
to
find
out
if
your
server
can
do
this
run
xdpyinfo
and
see
if
any
of
these
strings
appear
in
the
extensions
list
if
your
server
doesnt
have
this
you
may
want
to
investigate
compiling
patchlevel
or
later
or
bugging
your
vendor
kt
is
a
simpler
program
which
should
work
with

another

is
that

you
purchase

a

and
possibly
new
keycaps
and
then
you
can
move

its

each

each

independently
adjusts
to
an

i
have
a
copy
of
this

it
works
as
advertised
i
would
say
it
is
better
for
rsi
prevention
than
rsi
management
because
it
does
not
allow
breaks
at
periods
less
than
minutes
also
it
interrupts
you
based
on
clock
time
rather
than
typing
time
which
is
not
so
helpful

you

anything
away
from

still
cause

advantage
is
that
they
remind
you
to
break
from
whatever
you
are
doing
comments
my
own
experience
was
that
cutting
down
a
lot
on
my
typing
led
to
my
writing
a

more

still
reading
as
much
as
ever

actually
aggravated
the

improved

treatments
are
ineffective
it
does
imply
that
those
who
rely
on
faulty
methodology
and
reasoning
are
incapable
of
discovering
which
treatments
are
effective
and
which
are
not
first
of
all
i
think
you
are
arguing
against
a
straw
man
because
i
dont
think
that
anyone
here
is
arguing
that
quackery
pseudoscience
homeopathy
chiropracty
and
traditional
chinese
medicine
should
be
accepted
as
science
i
in
particular
think
the
basic
ideas
of
homeopathy
and
chiropracty
seem
extremely
flaky
what
some
of
us
do
believe
however
is
that
some
of
these
things
including
some
of
the
flaky
ideas
are
deserving
of
serious
scientific
attention
if
in
fact
it
were
true
as
you
have
stated
above
that
those
who
do
not
use
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
can
have
no
idea
what
is
effective
and
what
is
not
then
science
today
would
not
exist
for
all
of
current
science
is
based
on
the
past
work
of
scientists
whose
methodology
by
current
standards
was
seriously
flawed
it
is
certainly
true
that
as
methodology
improves
we
need
to
reexamine
those
results
derived
in
the
past
using
less
perfect
methodologies
it
is
also
true
that
the
results
obtained
by
people
today
who
still
rely
on
those
early
methodologies
needs
to
be
reexamined
in
a
more
rigorous
fashion
by
those
qualified
to
do
so
credibly
but
to
say
that
nobody
who
fails
to
do
elaborate
doubleblind
studies
is
capable
of
knowing
their
ass
from
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
to
say
that
no
ideas
that
come
from
outside
the
scientific
establishment
could
possibly
be
worthy
of
serious
investigation
this
truly
marks
ones
attitude
as
doctrinaire
cultist
this
attitude
is
not
compatible
with
a
belief
in
reason
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

on
injuries
first
and
foremost
of
importance
if
you
experience
pain
at
all
then
you
absolutely
need
to
go
see
a
doctor
as
soon
as
you
possibly
can
the
difference
of
a
day
or
two
can
mean
the
difference
between
a
short
recovery
and
a
long
drawnout
ordeal
go
see
a
doctor
now
your
gardenvariety
doctor
may
not
necessarily
be
familiar
with
this
sort
of
injury
generally
any
hospital
with
an
occupational

clinic

problems

now
then
problems
come
in
two
main
types
local
conditions
and
diffuse
conditions
local
problems
are
what
youd
expect
specific
muscles
tendons
tendon
sheaths
nerves
etc
being
inflamed
or
otherwise
hurt
diffuse
conditions
often
mistaken
for
local
problems
can
involve
muscle
discomfort
pain
burning
andor
tingling
with
identifiable
areas
of
tenderness
in
muscles
although
theyre
not
necessarily
the
problem
why
does
occupational
overuse
syndrome
occur
heres
the
theory
normally
your
muscles
and
tendons
get
blood
through
capillaries
which
pass
among
the
muscle
fibers
when
you
tense
a
muscle
you
restrict
the
blood
flow
by
the
time
youre
exerting
of
your
full
power
youre
completely
restricting
your
blood
flow
without
fresh
blood
your
muscles
use
stored
energy
until
they
run
out
then
they
switch
to
anaerobic
without
oxygen
metabolism
which
generates
nasty
byproducts
like
lactic
acid
which
cause
pain
once
one
muscle
hurts
all
its
neighbors
tense
up
perhaps
to
relieve
the
load
this
makes
sense
for
your
normal
sort
of
injury
but
it
only
makes
things
worse
with
repetitive
motion
more
tension
means
less
blood
flow
and
the
cycle
continues
another
byproduct
of
the
lack
of
blood
flow
is
tingling
and
numbness
from
your
nerves
they
need
blood
too
anyway
when
youre
typing
too
much
youre
never
really
giving
a
change
for
the
blood
to
get
back
where
it
belongs
because
your
muscles
never
relax
enough
to
let
the
blood
through
stress
poor
posture
and
poor
ergonomics
only
make
things
worse
specific
injuries
you
may
have
heard
of
note
most
injuries
come
in
two
flavors
acute
and
chronic
acute
injuries
are
severely
painful
and
noticable
chronic
conditions
have
less
pronounced
symptoms
but
are
every
bit
as
real
tenosynovitis
an
inflamation
of
the
tendon
sheath
chronic
tenosynovitis
occurs
when
the
repetitive
activity
is
mild
or
intermittent
not
enough
to
cause
acute
inflamation
but
enough
to
exceed
the
tendon
sheaths
ability
to
lubricate
the
tendon
as
a
result
the
tendon
sheath
thickens
gets
inflamed
and
youve
got
your
problem
tendonitis
an
inflammation
of
a
tendon
repeated
tensing
of
a
tendon
can
cause
inflamation
eventually
the
fibers
of
the
tendon
start
separating
and
can
even
break
leaving
behind
debris
which
induces
more
friction
more
swelling
and
more
pain
subacute
tendonitis
is
more
common
which
entails
a
dull
ache
over
the
wrist
and
forearm
some
tenderness
and
it
gets
worse
with
repetitive
activity
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
the
nerves
that
run
through
your
wrist
into
your
fingers
get
trapped
by
the
inflamed
muscles
around
them
symptoms
include
feeling
pins
and
needles
tingling
numbness
and
even
loss
of
sensation
cts
is
often
confused
for
a
diffuse
condition
adverse
mechanical
tension
also
known
as
neural
tension
this
is
where
the
nerves
running
down
to
your
arm
have
become
contracted
and
possibly
compressed
as
a
result
of
muscle
spasms
in
the
shoulders
and
elsewhere
amt
can
often
misdiagnosed
as
or
associated
with
one
of
the
other
oos
disorders
it
is
largely
reversible
and
can
be
treated
with
physiotherapy
brachial
plexus
stretches
and
trigger
point
therapy
others
for
just
about
every
part
of
your
body
theres
a
fancy
name
for
a
way
to
injure
it
by
now
you
should
be
getting
an
idea
of
how
oos
conditions
occur
and
why
just
be
careful
many
inexperienced
doctors
misdiagnose
problems
as
carpal
tunnel
syndrome
when
in
reality
you
may
have
a
completely
different
problem
always
get
a
second
opinion
before
somebody
does
something
drastic
to
you
like
surgery
typing
posture
ergonomics
prevention
treatment
the
most
important
element
of
both
prevention
and
recovery
is
to
reduce
tension
in
the
muscles
and
tendons
this
requires
learning
how
to
relax
if
youre
under
a
load
of
stress
this
is
doubly
important
tune
out
the
world
and
breath
deep
and
regular
relaxing
should
become
a
guiding
principle
in
your
work
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
every
three
minutes
take
a
three
second
break
really
do
it
every
three
minutes
its
also
helpful
to
work
in
comfortable
surroundings
calm
down
and
relax
if
you
cant
sleep
you
really
need
to
focus
on
this
rest
sleep
and
relaxation
are
really
a
big
deal
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
treatments
of
course
drugs
can
reduce
inflamation
and
pain
custommolded
splints
can
forcefully
prevent
bad
posture
surgery
can
fix
some
problems
exercise
can
help
strengthen
your
muscles
regular
stretching
can
help
prevent
injury
good
posture
and
a
good
ergonomic
workspace
promote
reduced
tension
ice
or
hotcold
contrast
baths
also
reduce
swelling
only
your
doctor
can
say
whats
best
for
you
posture
here
are
some
basic
guidelines
i
so
liked
the
way
this
was
written
in
the
new
zealand
book
that
im
lifting
it
almost
verbatim
from
appendix
dwallach
let
your
shoulders
relax
let
your
elbows
swing
free
keep
your
wrists
straight
pull
your
chin
in
to
look
down
dont
flop
your
head
forward
keep
the
hollow
in
the
base
of
your
spine
try
leaning
back
in
the
chair
dont
slouch
or
slump
forward
alter
your
posture
from
time
to
time
every
minutes
get
up
and
bend
your
spine
backward
set
the
seat
height
first
your
feet
should
be
flat
on
the
floor
there
should
be
no
undue
pressure
on
the
underside
of
your
thighs
near
the
knees
and
your
thighs
should
not
slope
too
much
now
draw
yourself
up
to
your
desk
and
see
that
its
height
is
comfortable
to
work
at
if
you
are
short
this
may
be
impossible
the
beest
remedy
is
to
raise
the
seat
height
and
prevent
your
legs
from
dangling
by
using
a
footrest
now
adjust
the
backrest
height
so
that
your
buttocks
fit
into
the
space
between
the
backrest
and
the
seat
pan
the
backrest
should
support
you
in
the
hollow
of
your
back
so
adjust
its
tilt
to
give
firm
support
in
this
area
if
you
operate
a
keyboard
you
will
be
able
to
spend
more
time
leaning
back
so
experiment
with
a
chair
with
a
taller
backrest
if
available
now
i
diverge
a
little
from
the
text
a
good
chair
makes
a
big
difference
if
you
dont
like
your
chair
go
find
a
better
one
you
really
want
adjustments
for
height
back
angle
back
height
and
maybe
even
seat
tilt
most
arm
rests
seem
to
get
in
the
way
although
some
more
expensive
chairs
have
height
adjustable
arm
rests
which
you
can
also
rotate
out
of
the
way
you
should
find
a
good
store
and
play
with
all
these
chairs
pick
one
thats
right
for
you
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
i
highly
recommend
just
chairs
the
name
says
it
all
keyboard
drawers
wrist
pads
and
keyboard
replacements
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
controvery
on
how
to
get
this
right
for
some
people
wrist
pads
seem
to
work
wonders
however
with
good
posture
you
shouldnt
be
resting
your
wrists
on
anything
you
would
prefer
your
keyboard
to
be
right
there
if
you
drop
your
arms
at
your
side
and
then
lift
your
hands
up
at
the
elbow
you
want
your
keyboard
under
your
hands
when
your
elbows
are
at
about
degrees
of
course
you
want
to
avoid
pronation
wrist
extension
and
ulnar
deviation
at
all
costs
wrist
pads
may
or
may
not
help
at
this
you
should
get
somebody
else
to
come
and
look
at
how
you
work
how
you
sit
how
you
type
and
how
you
relax
its
often
easier
for
somebody
else
to
notice
your
hunched
shoulders
or
deviated
hands
some
argue
that
the
normal
flat
keyboard
is
antiquated
and
poorly
designed

i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
most
of
the
arguments
about
science
in
scimed
scipsychology
etc
are
not
about
cases
where
people
are
rejecting
scientific
argumentevidenceproof
they
are
about
cases
where
no
adequate
scientific
research
has
been
done
in
some
cases
there
is
quite
a
bit
of
evidence
but
it
isnt
in
a
format
to
fit
doctrinaire
conceptions
of
what
science
is
here
it
is
again
this
indicates
confusion
between
proof
and
the
process
of
doing
science
you
are
making
precisely
one
of
the
points
i
wanted
to
make
i
fully
agree
with
you
that
there
is
a
big
distinction
between
the
process
of
science
and
the
end
result
as
an
end
result
of
science
one
wants
to
get
results
that
are
objectively
verifiable
but
there
is
nothing
objective
about
the
process
of
science
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
experiment
and
empirical
studies
are
an
important
part
of
science
but
they
are
merely
the
culmination
of
scientific
research
the
most
important
part
of
true
scientific
methodology
is
scientific
thinking
without
this
one
does
not
have
any
hypotheses
worth
testing
no
hypotheses
do
not
just
leap
out
at
you
after
you
look
at
enough
data
nor
do
they
simply
come
to
you
in
a
flash
one
day
while
youre
shaving
or
looking
out
the
window
at
least
not
unless
youve
done
a
lot
of
really
good
thinking
beforehand
the
difference
between
a
nobel
prize
level
scientist
and
a
mediocre
scientist
does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their
empirical
methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
it
bothers
me
even
more
that
there
are
many
fields
such
as
certain
parts
of
psychology
where
there
seems
to
be
no
thinking
at
all
but
mere
studies
testing
ad
hoc
hypotheses
and
im
especially
offended
by
russell
turpins
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesnt
get
you
anywhere
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

finding
someone
out
there
in

who
has
heard
of
something
similar
to
what
i
am
going
to
describe
here
i
have
a
fourteen
year
old
daugter
who
experienced
a
seizure
on
november
at
after
eating
kellogs
frosted
flakes
she
is
perfectly
healthy
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
and
there
is
no
history
of
seizures
in
either
side
of
the
family
all
the
tests
eeg
mri
ekg
came
out
negative
so
the
decision
was
made
to
do
nothing
and
just
wait
to
see
if
it
happened
again
well
we
were
going
along
fine
and
the
other
morning
april
she
had
a
bowl
of
another
kellogs
frosted
kind
of
cereal
fruit
loops
i
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
even
bought
that
junk
but
every
once
in
a
while
so
i
pour
it
in
her
bowl
and
think
oh
oh
this
is
the
same
kind
of
junk
she
was
eating
when
she
had
that
seizure
ten
minutes
later
she
had
a
full
blown
seizures
this
was
her
first
exposure
to
a
sugar
coated
cereal
since
the
last
seizure
when
i
mentioned
what
she
ate
the
first
time
as
a
possible
reason
for
the
seizure
the
neurologist
basically
negated
that
as
an
idea
now
after
this
second
episode
so
similar
in
nature
to
the
first
even
he
is
scratching
his
head
once
again
her
eeg
looks
normal
which
i
understand
can
happen
even
when
a
person
has
a
seizure
once
again
we
are
waiting
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
would
be
good
to
get
to
as
large
a
group
as
possible
to
see
if
anyone
has
any
experience
with
this
kind
of
thing
i
know
that
members
of
the
medical
community
are
sometimes
loathe
to
admit
the
importance
that
diet
and
foods
play
in
our
general
health
and
wellbeing
anyway
as
you
can
guess
i
am
worried
sick
about
this
and
would
appreciate
any
ideas
anyone
out
there
has
sorry
to

science
in
a
useful
direction
for
example
pasteur
discovered
that
racemic
acid
was
a
mixture
of
enantiomers
the
origin
of
stereochemistry
partly
because
he
liked
a
friends
crank
theory
of
chemical
action
the
friend
was
wrong
but
pasteurs
discovery
stood
a
prior
investigator
mitscherlich
looking
at
the
same
phenomenon
had
missed
a
crucial
detail
presumably
because
he
lacked
pasteurs
motivation
to
find
something
that
distinguished
racemic
acid
from
tartaric
now
we
say
dtartaric
acid
again
pasteur
discovered
the
differential
fermentation
of
enantiomers
tartaric
acid
again
not
because
of
some
rational
conviction
but
because
he
was
trying
to
produce
yeast
that
lived
on
ltartaric
acid
his
notebooks
contained
fantasies
of
becoming
the
newton
of
mirrorimage
life
which
he
never
admitted
publically
perhaps
the
best
example
is
the
discovery

internal

data
released
today
by
the
natural

defense

reveals
that
about
large
water
systems
serving
cities
from
boston
to
san
francisco
do
not
filter
to
remove
diseasecarrying
organisms
leaving
those
communities
potentially
vulnerable
to
a
disease
outbreak
similar
to
the
one
affecting
milwaukee
the
epa
list
is
attached
these
internal

reveal
that
the
safety
of
water
supplies
in
many
american
cities
is
threatened
by
inadequate
pollution
controls
or

said
erik

a

with
nrdc
water
contamination
isnt
just
a
problem
in
bangladesh
its
also
a
problem
in
bozeman
and
boston
as
of
june
about
large
surface
water
systems
on
epas
list
probably
will
be
breaking
the
law
the
safe
drinking
water
act
requires
all
surface
water
systems
to
either
filter
their
water
or
fully
protect
the
rivers
or
lakes
they
use
from
pollution
olson
continued
some
systems
are
moving
towards
eventually
implementing
filtration
systems
but
are
expected
to
miss
the
laws
deadline
olson
pointed
out
that
the
threat
of
contamination
is
already
a
reality
in
other
cities
a
survey
of
us
surface
water
systems
by
water
utility
scientists
found
that
percent
of
raw
water
samples
contained
the
milwaukee
organism
cryptosporidium
and
percent
contained
a
similar
parasite
called
giardia
adding
to
the
level
of
concern
a
general
accounting
office
study
released
today
by
house
health
and
environment
subcommittee
chairman
henry
waxman
indicates
serious
deficiencies
in
the
nations
system
for
conducting
and
following
through
on
sanitary
surveys
of
water
systems
this
new
information
raises
a
huge
warning
sign
that
millions
of
americans
can
no
longer
simply
turn
on
their
taps
and
be
assured
that
their
water
is
safe
to

we
must
immediately
put
into
place
programs
to
protect
water
sources
from
contamination
and
where
this
is
not
assured
filtration
equipment
must
be
installed
to
protect
the
public
olson
noted
the
time
has
come
for
many
of
the
nations
water
utilities
to
stop
dragging
their
feet
and
to
aggressively
protect
their

from

consumers
are
prepared
to
pay

modest

needed

exercise
and
migraine
we
were
talking
about
migraine
and
exercise
im
the
one
who
cant
fathom
the
thought
of
exercise
during
migraine
anyway
turning
the
thread
around
the
other
day
i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
im
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasnt
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this

success
depends
on
how
large
the
fluctuations
in
the
cycle
are
some
people
can
cycle
only
pounds
unfortunately
im
not
one
of
them
this
certainly
describes
my
situation
perfectly
for
me
there
is
a
constant
dynamic
between
my
tendency
to
eat
which
appears
to
be
totally
limitless
and
the
purely
conscious
desire
to
not
put
on
too
much
weight
when
i
get
too
fat
i
just
dietexercise
more
with
varying
degrees
of
success
to
take
off
the
extra
weight
usually
i
cycle
within
a
lb
range
but
smaller
and
larger
cycles
occur
as
well
im
always
afraid
that
this
method
will
stop
working
someday
but
usually
i
seem
to
be
able
to
hold
the
weight
gain
in
check
this
is
one
reason
i
have
a
hard
time
accepting
the
notion
of
some
metabolic
derangement
associated
with
cycle
dieting
that
results
in
longterm
weight
gain
i
have
been
cycle
dieting
for
at
least
years
without
seeing
such
a
change
i
think
a
vigorous
exercise
program
can
go
a
long
way
toward
keeping
the
cycles
smaller
and
the
baseline
weight
low

typically
they

not
every
wild

serves

that
when

the
only
one
they

the

this

is
such
analogical

the

between

does
not
lie
in
the
quality
of
their

methodology
it
depends
on
the
quality
of
their
thinking
it
really
bothers
me
that
so
many
graduate
students
seem
to
believe
that
they
are
doing
science
merely
because
they
are
conducting
empirical
studies
and
im
especially
offended
by
russell
turpins
repeated
assertion
that
science
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
avoiding
mistakes
simply
avoiding
mistakes
doesnt
get
you
anywhere
i
think
that
lee
lady
and
i
are
talking
at
cross
purposes
above
lady
seems
concerned
with
the
contrast
between
great
science
that
makes
big
advances
in
our
knowledge
and
mediocre
science
that
makes
smaller
steps
in
most
of
this
thread
i
have
been
concerned
with
the
difference
between
what
is
science
and
what
is
not
lee
lady
is
correct
when
she
asserts
that
the
difference
between
einstein
and
the
average
postdoc
physicist
is
the
quality
of
their
thought
but
what
is
the
difference
between
einstein
and
a
genius
who
would
be
a
great
scientist
but
whose
great
thoughts
are
scientifically
screwy
some
would
give
velikovsky
or
korzybski
as
examples
if
you
dont
like
these
choose
your
own
i
say
it
is
the
same
as
the
difference
between
the
mediocre
physicist
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
both
einstein
and
the
mediocre
physcists
have
disciplined
their
work
from
the
cumulative
knowledge
of
how
previous
researchers
went
wrong
both
velikovsky
and
the
mediocre
proponent
of
qi
have
failed
to
do
this
let
me
approach
this
from
a
second
direction
when
one
is
asked
to
review
a
paper
for
a
journal
or
conference
there
are
many
kinds
of
criticism
that
one
can
make
one
kind
of
criticism
is
that
the
work
is
just
wrong
or
misinformed
another
kind
of
criticism
is
that
the
work
while
technically
correct
is
either
not
important
or
not
interesting
the
first
difference
is
the
one
that
i
have
been
pointing
to
the
second
difference
is
the
one
that
lee
lady
seems
to
be
discussing
if
good
empirical
research
were
done
and
showed
that
there
is
some
merit
to
homeopathic
remedies
this
would
certainly
be
valuable
information
but
it
would
still
not
mean
that
homeopathy
qualifies
as
a
science
this
is
where
you
and
i
disagree
with
turpin
i
have
often
pointed
out
that
for
homeopathy
to
be
considered
scientific
what
is
needed
is
a
test
of
its
theoretical
claims
not
just
of
some
of
its
proposed
remedies
similarly
i
suspect
that
traditional
chinese
medicine
has
many
remedies
that
work
what
it
lacks
as
one
example
is
any
experiment
that
tests
the
presence
of
qi
in
order
to
have
science
one
must
have
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
not
a
mere
collection
of
empirically
validated
random
hypotheses
certainly
a
theoretical
structure
that
makes
sense
is
the
goal
in
areas
where
we
do
not
yet
have
this
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
forming
and
testing
smaller
hypotheses
lets
face
it
we
cannot
always
wait
for
an
einstein
to
come
along
and
make
everything
clear
for
us
sometimes
those
of
us
who
are
not
einstein
have
to
plug
along
and
make
small
amounts
of
progress
as
best
we
can

it
is
somewhat
interesting
that
when
anyone
is
challanged
to
provide
an
example
of
this
sort
the
only
one
they
come
up
with
is
the
one
about
kekule
surely
there
must
be
others
but
apparently
this
is
regarded
as
an
extreme
example
of
a
nonrational
process
in
science
whereby
a
successful
hypothesis
was
proposed
but
how
nonrational
is
it
indeed
an
extreme
example
it
came
out
of
nowhere
the
connection
kekule
saw
between
it
and
his
problem
is
fortunate

not
extraordinary

these

of

but
my
connecting
them
to
particular
problems
is
fraught
with
deliberation
and
occasional
fits
of
rationality
surely
it
wasnt
the
only
daydream
kekule
had
what
was
special
about
this

it

avoiding
mistakes
is
certainly
highly
desirable
however
it
is
also
widely
acknowledged
that
perfectionism
is
inimicable
to
creativity
and
in
ordinary
life
perfectionism
carried
beyond
a
certain
point
is
indicative
of
a
psychological
disorder
in
the
extreme
case
a
perfectionist
becomes
so
paralyzed
by
all
the
possible
mistakes
he
might
make
that
he
is
unable
to
even
leave
the
house
in
science
we
want
to
discover
as
much
truth
about
the
world
as
possible
and
we
also
want
to
have
as
much
certainty
as
possible
about
these
discoveries
usually
there
is
some
tradeoff
between
these
two
desiderata
the
search
for
scope
and
the
search
for
certainty
if
century
mathematicians
had
demanded
total
rigor
from
newton
and
leibniz
then
there
would
probably
be
no
calculus
today
because
neither
of
the
two
could
explain
calculus
in
a
way
that
really
made
sense
since
they
lacked
the
concept
of
a
limit
and
in
fact
because
of
the
lack
of
a
rigorous
foundation
they
made
a
number
of
errors
in
their
use
of
calculus
it
was
only
a
hundred
years
later
that
weistrass
was
able
to
give
a
solid
grounding
for
the
ideas
of
newton
and
leibniz
nonetheless
what
newton
and
leibniz
did
was
undoubtedly
science
and
mathematics
gained
a
great
deal
more
from
the
application
of
their
important
ideas
than
it
lost
through
the
mistakes
they

somebody
writes
i
doubt
if
einstein
used
any
formal
methodology
he
also
proposed
numerous
experiments
which
if
performed
would
distinguish
a
universe
in
which
special
relativity
holds
from
one
in
which
it
does
not
einstein
played
by
the
rules
which
demand
that
hypotheses
only
be
put
out
there
if
there
exists
a
specific
experiment
that
could
disprove
them
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
taken
to
the
extreme
i
believe
that
the
attitude
that
empirical
studies
are
everything
and
ideas
are
nothing
results
in
a
complete
stultification
of
science
for
one
thing
an
insistence
on
an
elaborate
and
expensive
methodology
results
in
a
sort
of
scientific
tradeunionism
where
those
outside
the
establishment
and
lacking
institutional
or
corporate
support
have
no
chance
to
obtain
a
hearing
i
dont
in
the
least
believe
that
this
is
the
intention
of
the
arbiters
of
scientific
methodology
nonetheless
it
is
one
of
the
results
and
although
institutional
science
has
certainly
produced
many
wonderful
results
i
think
it
is
a
foolish
arrogance
for
scientists
to
believe
that
no
one
outside
the
establishment
and
using
less
than
perfect
empirical
methodology
will
ever
come
with
anything
worthwhile
furthermore
the
big
bucks
approach
to
science
promotes
what
i
think
is
one
of
the
most
significant
errors
in
science
choosing
to
investigate
questions
because
they
can
be
readily
handled
by
the
currently
fashionable
methodology
or
because
one
can
readily
get
institutional
or
corporate
sponsorship
for
them
instead
of
directing
attention
to
those
questions
which
seem
to
have
fundamental
significance
for
instance
certain
questions
cannot
be
easily
investigated
with
statistical
methods
because
the
relevant
factors
are
not
quantitative
one
could
argue
that
this
is
the
case
for
almost
all
questions
in
many
areas
of
psychology
in
my
opinion
a
perusal
of
many
of
the
papers
resulting
from
the
attempt
by
psychologists
to
force
these
questions
into
a
statistical
framework
gives
the
lie
to
russell
turpins
assertion
that
current
scientific
methods
avoid
all
known
errors
i
think
that
asking
the
wrong
question
is
probably
the
most
fundamental
error
in
science
ignoring
potentially
valuable
ideas
is
one
of
the
others
and
i
think
that
scientific
journals
are
full
of
all
too
many
studies
done
with
impeccable
empirical
methods
but
which
are
worthless
because
the
wrong
question
was
asked
in
the
first
place
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

the

i
played
tennis
during
my
lunch
hour
im
out
of
tennis
shape
so
it
was
very
intense
exercise
i
got
overheated
and
dehydrated
afterwards
i
noticed
a
tingling
sensation
all
over
my
head
then
about
hours
later
i
could
feel
a
migraine
start
i
continued
to
drink
water
in
the
afternoon
i
took
cafergot
but
it
didnt
help
and
the
pain
started
although
it
wasnt
as
intense
as
it
usually
is
and
about
that
night
the
pain
subsided
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this
hi
janet
sounds
exactly
like
mine
same

same
onset
symptoms
same
cafergot
uselessness
same
duration
in
fact
of
all
the
people
i
know
who
have
migraines
none
have
been
so
similar
there
is
such
a
wide
variation
between
people
with
respect
to
what
causes
their
headaches
that
i
generally
dont
bother
sharing
what
ive
learned
about
mine
but
since
ours
seem
to
be
alike
here
are
my
observations
i
dont
think
its
heat
per
se
ive
had
more
in
winter
than
summer
dehydration
could
conceivably
figure
though
try
tanking
up
before
playing
rather
than
after
being
in
shape
doesnt
seem
to
help
me
much
either
ive
identified
four
factors
that
do
make
a
difference
listed
in
descending
order
of
importance
heavy
exercise
sleep
deprivation
fasting
eg
skipped
breakfast
physical
trauma
eg
head
bonk
heavy
exercise
has
preceded
all
of
my
postadolescent
migraines
but
i
dont
get
migraines
after
every
heavy
exercise
session
one
or
more
of
the
other
factors
must
be
present
usually
since
i
discovered
this
ive
been
nearly
migrainefree
relapsing
only
once
every
two
or
three
years
when
i
get
cocky
its
been
so
long
maybe
i
just
dont
get
them
anymore
and
stop
being
careful
hope
this
is
helpful

psoriatic
arthritis
info
needed
please
a
friend
of
mine
has
been
diagnosed
with
psoriatic
arthritis
as
a
result
of
trauma
sustained
in
a
car
accident
several
years
ago
the
psoriasis
is
under
control
but
the
arthritis
part
of
the
illness
is
not
ansaid
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
worked
pretty
well
for
three
years
but
isnt
helping
much
now
my
friend
is
now
taking
meclomen
another
nsaid
but
this
isnt
helping
control
the
pain
at
all
in
the
past
two
months
my
friend
has
also
started
taking
azulfadine
along
with
the
nsaid
medicines
but
the
effects
of
the
combined
drugs
arent
supposed
to
be
realized
for
several
months
as
a
result
of
the
pain
my
friend
is
having
problems
sleeping
staying
in
one
position
too
long
is
an
ordeal
another
major
contributor
to
pain
is
that
tendonitis
has
now
developed
left
thumb
and
hand
with
numbness
at
the
base
of
the
palm
bottom
of
feet
shoulders
and
outer
thighs
the
tendonitis
is
quite
painful
yet
my
friends
doctor
has
not
recommended
any
form
of
treatment
to
relieve
it
the
latest
twist
is
that
the
doctor
has
dropped
the
antiinflammatories
and
is
now
recommending
prednisone
the
hope
is
that
the
prednisone
will
relieve
some
of
the
pain
from
the
tendonitis
my
friend
is
a
year
old
male
who
feels
like
hes

words
not

anyone
is
aware
of
any
new
treatments
for
psoriatic
arthritis
alternative

of
the
differences
in

the
vision
was
considered
less
clear
after
the
surgery
than
with
glasses
alone
if
this
is
completly

to
the
intentional
slight
undercorrection
then
it
can
be
compensated
for
when
necessary

if

can

worn
afterall
it
is
important
to
know
if
that
is
not
the
case
however
and
some

consequence
of

would

most

the

the
generate
part
can
be
totally
irrational
as
long
as
the

works
properly
i
think
we
agree
on
much
however
the
paragraphs
above
seem
to
repeat
uncritically
the
standard
kuhnlakatosfeyerabend
view
of
progress
and
rationality
in
science
since
ive
addressed
these
issues
in
this
newsgroup
in
the
not
too
distant
past
i
wont
go
into
them
again
now
what
is
wrong
with
the
above
observation
is
that
it
explicitly
gives
the
impression
and
you
may
not
in
fact
hold
this
view
that
the
common
perhaps
even
the
correct
approach
for
a

follow
is
to
sit
around
having
flights
of
fancy
and
scheming
on
the
basis
of
his
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
it
further
at
least
implicitly
advances
the
position
that
sciences
goes
forward
and
it
is
not
clear
what
this
means
given
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
by
generating
in
a
completely
nonrational
and
even
random
way
a
plethora
of
hypotheses
and
theories
that
are
then
weeded
out
via
the
critical
function
of
science
though
why
this
critical
function
should
be
less
subject
to
the
nonrational
forces
is
a
mystery
if
experimental
design
hypotheses
creation
and
theory
construction
are
subject
to
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
then
this
must
be
equally
true
of
the
application
of
any
critical
function
concerning
replication
this
is
what
leads
one
ala
feyerabend
to
an
anything
goes

true
the
generation
part
can
be
totally
irrational
but
typically
it
is
not
anecdotes
concerning
instances
where
a

seems
to
have
resulted
in
some
way
from
a

or
from

thing
is
not

sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless

make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
that
occurs
about
times
in
the
human
genome
unfortunately
for
warrens
fantasy
it
turns
out
to
be
a
transposon
that
is
present
in
so
many
copies
because
it
replicates
itself
and
copies
itself
back
into
the
genome
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristics
of
transposons
were
much
elucidated
the
necessity
of
a
cellular
reverse
transcriptase
was
recognized
and
the
standard
method
of
recognizing
human
dna
was
created
other
species
have
different
sets
of
transposons
fortunately
for
me
warren
and
i
used
to
eat
dinner
at
tgi
fridays
all
the
time
it
further
at
least
implicitly
advances
the
position
that
sciences
goes
forward
and
it
is
not
clear
what
this
means
given
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
by
generating
in
a
completely
nonrational
and
even
random
way
a
plethora
of
hypotheses
and
theories
that
are
then
weeded
out
via
the
critical
function
of
science
im
not
sure
that
its
random
but
there
is
no
known
rational
mechanism
for
generating
a
rich
set
of
interesting
hypotheses
if
you
are
really
working
in
an
unknown
area
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
have
much
sense
of
what
might
or
might
not
be
true
under
those
circumstances
the
best
thing
to
do
is
just
follow
whatever
instincts
you
have
if
they
are
wrong
you
will
find
out
soon
enough
but
at
least
you
will
find
out
something
if
you
try
to
do
experiments
at
random
with
no
prior
conceptions
at
all
in
mind
you
will
probably
get
nowhere
though
why
this
critical
function
should
be
less
subject
to
the
nonrational
forces
is
a
mystery
unfortunately
the
critical
function
does
sometimes
become
hostage
to
nonrational
forces
then
we
get
varieties
of
pathological
science
lysenko
mirskys
opposition
to
dnaasgene
cold
fusion
and
so
forth
if
experimental
design
hypotheses
creation
and
theory
construction
are
subject
to
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
then
this
must
be
equally
true
of
the
application
of
any
critical
function
concerning
replication
this
is
what
leads
one
ala
feyerabend
to
an
anything
goes
view
i
dont
agree
that
this
follows
in
fact
this
is
exactly
the
point
at
which
i
disagree
with
feyerabend
it
is
a
most
important
part
of
the
culture
of
science
that
one
keeps
ones
jealousies
out
of
the
refereeing
process
failures
there
are
aplenty
but
on
the
whole
things
work
out
another
point
there
are
a
couple
of
senses
of
the
phrase
experimental
design
id
say
that
the
less
rational
part
is
in
experimental
choice
not
design

a

seems

have

some
way
from
a

from

do
not
generalize
well
to

clear

me
what
you
mean
by
rational
vs
irrational
perhaps
you
can
give
a
few
examples
of
surprising
experiments
that
were
tried
out
for
perfectly
rational
reasons
or
interesting
new

then
it

that

go

admittedly
this

just

i
also

i
need
advice
with
a
situation
which
occurred
between
me
and
a
physican
which
upset
me
i
saw
this
doctor
for
a
problem
with
recurring
pain
he
suggested
medication
and
a
course
of
treatment
and
told
me
that
i
need
to
call
him
days
after
i
begin
the
medication
so
that
he
may
monitor
its
effectiveness
as
well
as
my
general
health
i
did
exactly
as
he
asked
and
made
the
call
reaching
his
secretary
i
explained
to
her
that
i
was
following
up
at
the
doctors
request
and
that
i
was
worried
because
the
pain
episodes
were
becoming
more
frequent
and
the
medication
did
not
seem
effective
the
doctor
called
me
back
and
his
first
words
were
whatever
you
want
youd
better
make
it
quick
im
very
busy
and
dont
have
time
to
chit
chat
with
you
i
told
him
i
was
simply
following
his
instructions
to
call
on
the
day
to
status
him
and
that
i
was
feeling
worse
i
then
asked
if
perhaps
there
was
a
better
time
for
us
to
talk
when
he
had
more
time
he
responded
just
spit
it
out
now
because
no
time
is
a
good
time
said
in
a
raised
voice
i
started
to
feel
upset
and
tried
to
explain
quickly
what
was
going
on
with
my
condition
but
my
nervousness
interfered
with
my
choice
of
words
and
i
kind
of
stuttered
and
then
said
well
never
mind
and
he
said
hell
talk
to
various
colleagues
about
other
medications
and
hell
call
me
some
other
time
this
doctor
called
me
that
evening
and
said
because
i
didnt
express
myself
well
he
was
confused
about
what
i
wanted
at
this
point
i
was
pretty
upset
and
i
told
him
in
an
amazingly
polite
voice
considering
how
angry
i
felt
that
his
earlier
manner
had
hurt
my
feelings
he
told
me
that
he
just
doesnt
have
time
to
rap
with
patients
and
thought
that
was
what
i
wanted
i
told
him
that
to
assume
i
was
calling
to
rap
was
insulting
and
said
again
that
i
was
just
following
through
on
his
orders
he
responded
that
he
resented
the
implication
that
he
felt
i
was
making
that
he
was
not
interested
in
learning
about
what
his
patients
have
to
say
about
their
condition
status
he
then
gave
me
this
apology
i
am
sorry
that
there
was
a
miscommunication
and
you
mistakenly
thought
i
was
insulting
i
am
not
trying
to
insult
you
but
i
am
not
that
knowledgeable
about
pain
and
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
time
to
deal
with
that
he
then
told
me
to
call
him
the
next
day
for
further
instructions
on
how
do
deal
with
my
pain
and
medication
i
am
still
upset
and
have
not
yet
called
my
questions
should
i
continue
to
have
this
doctor
manage
my
care
since
i
am
in
pain
off
and
on
i
realize
that
this
may
cause
me
to
be
more
anxietous
so
am
i
perhaps
overreacting
or
overly
sensitive
if
this
doctor
refers
me
to
his
colleague
who
knows
more
about
the
type
of
pain
i
have
he
still
wants
me
to
status
him
on
my
condition
but
now
i
am
afraid
to
call
him

came
to
a
completly
different
conclusion
ive
eaten
chinese
food
for
ages
and
never
had
problems
i
went
with
some
chinese
malaysian
friends
to
a
swanky
chinses

they
ordered
lots

stuff
i
had
never

before
the
only
thing
i
can

of
that
meal
was
the
first
course
scallops
served
in
the
shell
with
a
soytype
sauce
i
thought
well
ive
only
had
scallops
once
and
i
was
sick
after
but
that
could
have
been
a
coincidence
that
night
as
i
sat
on
the
bathroom
floor
sweating
and
emptying
my
stomach
the
hard
way
i
decided
i
would
never
touch
another
scallop
i
may
not

allergic
but
i
dont

to
take
the
chance
i
dont

scallops

did

discomforts

clam

i

ten

about
an
hour
after

i
collapsed
in
a
chair
with
my

feeling
puffed
up
my
scalp
tingling
my

too
weak
to
stand
up
the
symptoms
lasted
for
about
minutes
determined
to
find
out
the
cause
of
my
first
reaction
i
went
back
to
the
chinese
restuarant
and
ordered
the

the

a

flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
but
why
do
you
characterize
this
as
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
while
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
scientific
context
here
it
appears
obvious
that
his
speculation
for
lack
of
a
better
or
more
neutral
word
was
at
least
in
significant
part
a
consequence
of
his
knowledge
of
and
acceptance
of
current
theory
coupled
with
his
observations
it
would
appear
that
something
quite
rational
was
going
on
as
he
attempted
to
fit
his
observation
into
that
theory
or
to
tailor
the
theory
to
cover
the
observation
this
does
not
seem
like
an
example
of
what
most
would
normally
call
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
you
mean
by
rational
vs
irrational
perhaps
you
can
give
a
few
examples
of
surprising
experiments
that
were
tried
out
for
perfectly
rational
reasons
or
interesting
new
theories
that
were
first
advanced
from
logical
grounds
the
main
examples
i
can
think
of
are
from
modern
highenergy
physics
which
is
not
typical
of
science
as
a
whole
well
i
think
someone
else
in
this
thread
was
the
first
to
use
the
word
also
extrascientific
etc
nor
am
i
prepared
to
give
a
general
account
of
rationality
in
terms
of
examples
there
is
some
danger
of
beginning
to
quibble
over
what
a
surprising
experiment
is
what
counts
as
surprising
etc
the
same
may
be
said
about
logical
grounds
my
point
is
that
quite
frequently
perhaps
even
most
frequently
the
roots
of
a
new
theory
can
be
traced
to
previously
existing
theories
or
even
to
previously
rejected
hypotheses
of
some
other
theory
or
domain
i
would
offer
some
rather
well
known
examples
such
as
toricellis
puy
de
dome
experiment
done
for
the
sake
of
his
sea
of
air
hypothesis
was
this
theory
and
the
resulting
experimental
test
surprising
well
given
the
prior
explanations
of
the
phenomena
involved
it
certainly
must
be
counted
as
so
was
the
theory
constructed
and
the
experiment
designed
out
of
perfectly
rational
grounds
well
there
was
a
pretty
successful
and
well
know
theory
of
fluids
the
analogy
to
fluids
by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelty
was
in
thinking
of
air
as
a
fluid
but
this
was
quite
a
novelty
at
the
time
was
the
theory
interesting
yes
was
it
new
well
one
could
argue
that
it
was
merely
the
extension
of
an
existing
theory
to
a
new
domain
but
i
think
this
begs
certain
questions
we

debate

avoiding
mistakes
is
certainly
highly
desirable
however
it
is
also
widely
acknowledged
that
perfectionism
is
inimicable

extreme

becomes

paralyzed

the

he
might
make
that
he
is
unable
to
even
leave
the
house
one
of
the
most
important
and
difficult
aspects
of
reasoning
about
empirical
investigation
lies
in
understanding
the
context
scope
and
importance
of
the
various
arguments
and
pieces
of
evidence
that
are
marshalled
for
a
claim
some
errors
break
the
back
of
a
piece
of
research
some
leave
a
hole
that
needs
to
be
filled
in
and
some
are
trivial
in
their
importance
it
is
a
grave
mistake
to
confuse
these
past
snippets
from
this
thread
i
doubt
if
einstein
used
any
formal
methodology
he
also
proposed
numerous
experiments
which
if
performed
would
distinguish
a
universe
in
which
special

from

it

lee

these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
these
posters
are
making
the
mistake
that
i
have
previously
criticized
of
adhering
to
a
methodological
recipe
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
is
neither
always
possible
nor
always
important
on
the
other
hand
if
someone
is
proposing
a
remedy
that
supposedly
alleviates
a
chronic
medical
problem
we
have
enough
knowledge
of
the
errors
that
have
plagued
this
kind
of
claim
to
ask
for
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
to
alleviate
our
skepticism
rules
such
as
support
the
hypothesis
by
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
are
too
narrow
to
apply
to
all
investigation
i
think
that
the
requirements
for
particular
reasoning
to
be
convincing
depends
greatly
on
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
past
reasoning
about
the
same
kinds
of
things
to
reuse
the
previous
example
we
know
that
conclusions
from
uncontrolled
observations
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medical
problems
are
notoriously
problematic

why
do

i
certainly
dont

some

i
would

some
rather
well
known
examples
such
as
toricellis
puy

experiment
done
for
the
sake
of
his
sea
of
air
hypothesis
im
not
familiar
with
the
history
of
this
experiment
although
arguably
i
should
be
surprising
well
given
the
prior
explanations
of
the
phenomena
involved
it
certainly
be
counted
as
so
was
the
theory
constructed
and
the
experiment
designed
out
of
perfectly
rational
grounds
well
there
was
a
pretty
successful
and
well
know
theory
of
fluids
the
analogy
to
fluids
by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelty
was
in
thinking
of
air
as
a
fluid
but
this
was
quite
a
novelty
at
the
time
was
the
theory
interesting
yes
was
it
new
well
one
could
argue
that
it
was
merely
the
extension
of
an
existing
theory
to
a
new
domain
but
i
think
this
begs
certain
questions
we
can
debate
that
if
you
like
i
think
that
it
is
enough
if
his
contemporaries
found
the
result
surprising
thats
not
what
id
quibble
about
what
id
like
to
know
are
toricellis
reasons
for
doing
his
experiment
not
the
post
hoc
constructed
reasons
but
the
thoughts
in
his
head
as
he
considered
the
problem
it
may
be
impossible
to
know
much
about
toricellis
thoughts
thats
too
bad
if
it
is
so
one
of
rootbernsteins
services
to
science
is
that
he
has
gone
rooting
about
in
pasteurs
and
flemings
and
other
peoples
notes
and
has
discovered
some
surprising
clues
about
their
motivations

something
similar

what
i
am

here
i
have
a
fourteen
year
old
daugter
who
experienced
a
seizure
on
november
at
after
eating
kellogs
frosted
flakes
she
is
perfectly
healthy
had
never
experienced
anything
like
this
before
and
there
is
no
history
of
seizures
in
either
side
of
the
family
all
the
tests
eeg
mri
ekg
came
out
negative
so
the
decision
was
made
to
do
nothing
and
just
wait
to
see
if
it
happened
again
well
we
were
going
along
fine
and
the
other
morning
april
she
had
a
bowl
of
another
kellogs
frosted
kind
of
cereal
fruit
loops
i
am
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
even
bought
that
junk
but
every
once
in
a
while
so
i
pour
it
in
her
bowl
and
think
oh
oh
this
is
the
same
kind
of
junk
she
was
eating
when
she
had
that
seizure
ten
minutes
later
she
had
a
full
blown
seizures
this
was
her
first
exposure
to
a
sugar
coated
cereal
since
the
last
seizure
my
daughter
has
epilepsy
and
i
attend
a
monthly
parent
support
group
just
wednesday
night
a
mother
was
telling
how
she
decided
to
throw
all
the
junk
food
out
and
see
if
it
made
a
difference
in
her
yearolds
seizures
he
was
having
about
one
seizure
per
week
she
reported
that
she
did
this
on
thursday
he
had
a
seizure
on
saturday
and
then
went
weeks
without
a
seizure
on
easter
he
went
to
grandmas
and
ate
candy
pop
anything
he
wanted
he
had
a
seizure
the
next
day
she
sees
sensitivity
to
nutrasweet
sugar
colors
caffine
and
corn
with
corn
she
says
he
gets
very
nervous
and
aggresive
with
my
own
daughter
age
i
think
she
is
also
sensitive
and
stays
away
from
those
foods
on
her
own
she
has
never
had
gum
wont
eat
candy
prefers
an
apple
to
a
cookie
doesnt
like
chocolate
and
wont
even
use

her

on

is

unfortunately
hep

infection
can
eventuate
in
chronic

and
subsequent
cirrhosis
although
not
many
patients
with
hep
b
go
on
to
chronic
hepatitis
it
does
still
occur
in
a
good
number
and
is
something
to
keep
in
mind
hepatitis
c
was
nona
nonb
hep
much
more
frequently
leads
to
chronic
hep
and
cirrhosis
there
is
also
an
autimmune
chronic
hepatitis
that
affects
mostly
younger
women
which
also
leads
to
cirrhosis
of
course
cirrhosis
is
a
most
unkind
disease
the
most
dangerous
effects
relate
to
portal
hypertension
and
loss
of
liver
function
patients
develop
lifethreatening
variceal
bleeds
and
hepatic
comas
among
many
other
problems
as
a
result
of
disturbances
in
hepatic
circulation
less
ominously
they
can
exhibit
the
effects
of
hyperestrogenemia
which
often
characterize
patients
with
cirrhosis
these
effects
include
telangiactasias
small
red
skin
lesions
and
in
men
gynecomastia
breast
development
the
only
real
treatment
for
cirrhosis
is
liver
transplant
keep
in
mind
that
cirrhosis
is
not
expected
at
least
statistically
in
your
friends
case
nevertheless
you
might
want
to
bring
up
the
subject
of
chronic

with

yes

though
id
make
the

in

of
all

by
human
beings
and
therefore
made
with
various
biases
but
here
your
message
leaves
talk
of
hypothesis
and
gets
back
once
again
to
equating
the
business
of
science
with
the
end
result
the
gizmo
produced
science
works
very
well
at
developing
theories
within
paradigms
but
is
very
poor
at
dealing
with
paradigm
shifts
if
i
develop
a
novel
paradigm
that
explains
homeopathy
chinese
medicine
or
spontaneous
combustion
if
the
paradigm
is
useful
it
will
show
me
the
way
to
make
observations
that
prove
or
disprove
it
my
point
isnt
so
much
whether
or
not
you
have
a
novel
paradigm
but
how
you
come
about
developing
it
the
paradigm
of
modern
medicine
is
that
the
body
can
be
reduced
to
a
set
of
essentially
mechanical
operations
wherein
disease
is
seen
as
malfunctions
in
the
machinery
essentially
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
it
seems
likely
that
theories
based
upon
this
paradigm
do
not
give
a
complete
discription
of
the
universe
medicine
healing
etc
indeed
we
now
recognize
an
important
psychological
component
to
healing
perhaps
youd
admit
that
this
is
an
oversimplification
on
your
part
the
topic
of
the
philosophy
of
science
is
made
for
them
im
making
them
too
but
i
think
that
it
also
summarizes
popular
misconceptions
of
science
and
the
business
of
doing
science
biomedical
research
doesnt
make
any
basic
assumptions
that
arent
the
same
as
any
other
discipline
of
scientific
research
that
is
that
you
make
empirical
observations
form
an
hypothesis
and
test
it
modern
medicine
has
much
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
the
old
newtonian
model
of
the
world
and
i
doubt
that
many
psychologists
would
appreciate
being

view
psychology
also
has
more
to
do
with
biochemistry
than
spoon
bending
it
is
also
important
to
distinguish
reason
from
science
science
may
be
reasonable
but
so
are
many
nonscientific
methodologies
aristotle
reasoned
that
frogs
came
from
mud
by
observing
one
hop
out
of
a
puddle
oversimplified
of
course
but
a
good
example
this
is
an
empirical
observa
tion
it
was
then
tested
though
perhaps
not
by
aristotle
and
eventually
found
wanting
in
the
meantime
some
folk
will
have
continued
to
believe

generation

nothing
at

surprising
about
this
its
the
way
the
gathering
of
knowledge
works
there
are
probably
more
than
a
few
things
in
my
own
discipline
of
molecular
biology
that
will
be
found
to
be
totally
offbase
even
idiotic
to
someone
in
the
future
these
future
people
wont
have
come
to
these
relevations
because
they
had
suddenly
gone
all
zenlike
and
had
a
vision
in
an
lsd
trip
someone
will
have
thought
of
something
new
and
tested
it
this
is
the
bit
that
people
who
seem
to
relish
misrepresenting
science
and
research
cant
seem
to
wrap
their
minds
around
science
is
a
creative
process
what
i
think
of
as
factual
and
good
research
can
be
totally
turned
on
its
head
tommorrow
by
new
results
and
theories
again
i
think
it
gets
down
to
defining
what
you
mean
by
science
i
often
dont
recognize
what
it
is
that
i
do
and
am
involved
in
in
the
way
science
is
portrayed
by
popular
media
or
writings
of
people
in
the
humanities
they
portray
science
as
a
collection
of
immutable
facts
pronouncements
of
truth
in
big
gold
letters
thats
silly
its
as
though
we
just
go
into
the
lab
turn
over
a
stone
and
come
up
with
a
mechanism
for
transcriptional
regula
tion

much

that

my

she

friend

a
friend
of
mine
is
having
some
symptoms
and
has
asked
me
to
post
the
following
information
a
few
weeks
ago
she
noticed
that
some
of
her
hair
was
starting
to
fall
out
she
would
touch
her
head
and
strands
of
hair
would
just
fall
right
out
by
the
way
she
is
or
years
old
it
continued
to
occur
until
she
had
a
bald
spot
about
the
size
of
a
half
dollar
since
that
time
she
has
gotten
two
more
bald
spots
of
the
same
size
other
symptoms
shes
described
include
several
months
of
an
irregular
menstrual
cycle
which
is
strange
for
her
because
she
has
always
been
extremely
regular
laryngitis
every
few
days
she
will
wake
up
one
morning
and
have
almost
no
voice
and
then
the
next
day
its
fine
dizzy
spells
she
claims
that
shes
had
or
very
bad
dizzy
spells
early
in
the
morning
including
one
that
knocked
her
to
the
ground
and
general
fatigue
she
went
to
a
dermatologist
first
who
couldnt
find
any
reason
for
the
symptoms
and
sent
her
to
an
internist
who
suspected
thyroid
problems
he
did
the
blood
work
and
claims
that
everything
came
back
normal
shes
very
concerned
and
very
confused
does
anyone
have
any
ideas
or
suggestions
i
told
her
that
i
thought
she
should
see
an
endocrinologist
does
that
sound
like
the
right
idea
by
the
way
in
case
you
are
going
to
askno
she
has
recently
taken
any
medications
that
would
cause
these
symptomsno
she
hasnt
recently
changed
her
hair
products
and
she
hasnt

i
have
been
contemplating
this
idea
for
some
time
as
well
i
am
not
a
doctor
but
my
wife
is
a
nurse
and
i
know
a
lot
of
doctors
and
nurses
the
point
here
being
that
doctors
and
nurses
do
not
seem
to
get
sick
nearly
as
much
as
people
outside
the
medical
profession
this
is
a
lovely
area
for
anecdotes
but
i
am
sure
you
are
on
to
something
as
a
physician
i
almost
never
get
sick
usually
when
something
horrendous
is
going
around
i
either
dont
get
it
at
all
or
get
a
very
mild
case
when
i
do
get
really
sick
it
is
always
something
unusual
this
was
not
the
situation
when
i
was
in
medical
school
particularly
on
pediatrics
i
never
had
younger
siblings
myself
and
when
i
went
on
the
pediatric
wards
i
suddenly
found
myself
confronting
all
sorts
of
infectious
challenges
that
my
body
was
not
ready
for
pediatrics
for
me
was
three
solid
months
of
illness
and
i
had
a
temp
of
when
i
took
the
final
exam
i
think
what
happens
is
that
during
training
and
beyond
we
are
constantly
exposed
to
new
things
and
we
have
the
usual
reactions
to
them
so
that
later
on
when
challenged
with
something
it
is
more
likely
a
reexposure
for
us
so
we
deal
with
it
well
and
get
a
mild
illness
i
dont
think
it
is
that
the
immune
system
is
hyped
up
in
any
way
also
dont

what
is
wrong
with
the
above

is
that
it
explicitly

the
impression
and
you
may
not
in
fact
hold
this
view
that
the
common
perhaps
even
the
correct
approach
for
a
scientist
to
follow
is
to
sit
around
having
flights
of
fancy
and
scheming
on
the
basis
of
his
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
the
danger
in
philosophizing
about
science
is
that
theory
and
generalization
can
end
up
being
far
removed
from
the
actual
daytoday
of
the
grunt
at
the
bench
yes
its
great
to
be
involved
in
a
process
were
i
can
walk
into
the
lab
after
a
heavy
night
of
dreaming
and
just
do
something
for
the
hell
of
it
as
long
as
my
advisor
doesnt
catch
me
which
is
easy
enough
to
do
but
stamping
out
such
behavior
seems
to
be
the
purpose
in
life
of
grant
review
committees
and
the
peer
review
process
in
general
in
todays
world
thats
what
determines
what
science
is
what
gets
funded
and
a
damn
good
thing
to
flights
of
fantasy
just
dont
have
much
chance
of
producing
anything
at
least
not
in
biomedical
research
the
surest
way
for
a
graduate
student
to
ruin
their
life
is
to
work
in
a
lab
where
the
boss
is
more
concerned
with
fleshing
out
hisher
fantasies
than
with
having
the
student
work
on
a
project
that
actually
has
a
good
chance
of
producing
some
results
mds
seem
to
be
particularly
prone
to
this
aberrant
behavior
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
that
occurs
about
times
in
the
human
genome
unfortunately
for
warrens
fantasy
it
turns
out
to
be
a
transposon
that
is
present
in
so
many
copies
because
it
replicates
itself
and
copies
itself
back
into
the
genome
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristics
of
transposons
were
much
elucidated
the
necessity
of
a
cellular
reverse
transcriptase
was
recognized
and
the
standard
method
of
recognizing
human
dna
was
created
other
species
have
different
sets
of
transposons
fortunately
for
me
warren
and
i
used
to
eat
dinner
at
tgi
fridays
all
the
time
i
have
to
agree

to

ive
read

of

and
middle
repetitive
sequence
work
and
its
really

good

for

fields

its

a

turned
up

kathleen

my
year
old
pomeranian
had
a
nasty
reaction
to
this
vaccination
suffice
it
to
say
we
will
not
vaccinate
her
for
lyme
disease
again
shes
been
camping
through
some
states
and
has
backpacked
with
us
as
well
and
we
are
used
to
watching
for
ticks
and
dealing
with
them
and
we
simply
wont
take
her
to
really
active
lyme
disease
areas
not
to
drag
this
out
anymore
but
many
veterinarians
feel
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
is
so
easy
to
treat
that
in
an
endemic
area
they
often
just
give
the
appropriate
antibiotics
to
dogs
presenting
with
lameness
swollen
joints
fever
a
recent
paper
march
has
finally
established
that
lyme
disease
in
dogs
can
be
reproduced
in
a
controlled
experimentaly
setting
this
has
been
an
ellusive
matter
for
researchers
and
is
one
of
the
fundamental
requirements
for
many
to
acknowledge
an
agent
as
being
causitive
of
a
particular
disease
up
to
now
only
the
vaccine
manufacturer
has
been
able
to
prove
that
the
disease
exists
this
paper
is
noteworthy
in
two
other
regards
none
of
the
animals
they
infected
were
treated
in
any
way
the
dogs
had
episodes
of
lameness
during
a
week
period
which
occurred
months
after
exposure
after
this
period
none
showed
any
further
clinical
signs
up
to
the
month
observation
period
of
the
study
so
these
are
proven
clinically
sick
lyme
patients
showing
spontaneous
recovery
without
the
benefit
of
drug
treatment
of
course
observations
longer
than
months
will
be
necessary
to
be
sure
the
disease
doesnt
have
the
same
chronicity
that
some
see
in
humans
the
addendum
to
the
paper
calls
into
question
the
techniques
used
by
the
vaccine
manufacturer
to
validate
the
vaccine
of
course
they
want
the
world
to
use
the
model
they
developed
in
order
to
test
vaccine
efficacy
anyway
maybe
we
will
see
some
independent
scientifically
sound
evaluations
of
this
vaccine
in
the
next
year

most

it

takes
half
my

gives

a

i

and
go

something
else
i
dont

when

unless

then
i

a

year
round
fast
i
also
bike
to
stores
movies
and
everywhere
else
as
ive
never
owned

i
estimate
this
burns
about
calories
a

it
also
helps
build
and
maintain
muscle
mass
prevent
insulin
resistance
diabetes
runs
in

and
increase
my

even
so
my
metabolism
is
so
low
that
when
im

im
most
comfortable
with
a
temperature
in

f
and
usually
wear
a
sweater
if
it
drops
to
cycling
also
motivates
me
to
avoid
every
excess
ounce
cyclists
routinely
pay
a
premium
for
cycling
products
that
weigh
slightly
less
than
others
but
its
easier
and
cheaper
to
trim
weight
from
the
rider
than
from
the
vehicle
theres
no
question
in
my
mind
that
my
metabolism
is
radically
different
from
that
of
most
people
who
have
never
been
fat
fortunately
it
isnt
different
in
a
way
that
precludes
excellent

obviously
i

that
every

who
does
what
ive

will
have
the

i
did

ive
never

that

re
what
are
the
problems
with
nutrasweet
aspartame
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
phenylalanine
is
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
it
is
an
amino
acid
and
everyone
uses
small
quantities
of
it
for
protein
synthesis
in
the
body
some
people
have
a
disease
known
as
phenylketoneurea
and
they
are
missing
the
enzyme
necessary
to
degrade
this
compound
and
eliminate
it
from
the
body
for
them
it
will
accumulate
in
the
body
and
in
high
levels
this
is
toxic
to
growing
nerve
cells
therefore
it
is
only
a
major
problem
in
young
children
until
around
age
or
so
or
women
who
are
pregnant
and
have
this
disorder
it
used
to
be
a
leading
cause
of
brain
damage
in
infants
but
now
it
can
be
easily
detected
at
birth
and
then
one
must
simply
avoid
comsumption
of
phenylalanine
as
a
child
or

pregnant

a

while
i
am
unfamiliar
with

here
it
appears
obvious
that
his
speculation
for
lack
of
a
better
or
more
neutral
word
was
at
least
in
significant
part
a
consequence
of
his
knowledge
of
and
acceptance
of
current
theory
coupled
with
his
observations
it
would
appear
that
something
quite
rational
was
going
on
as
he
attempted
to
fit
his
observation
into
that
theory
or
to
tailor
the
theory
to
cover
the
observation
whether
a
scientific
idea
comes
while

dreaming
or
having
a
fantasy
or
watching
an
apple
fall
newton
or
sitting
in

archimedes
it
is
ultimately
the
result
of
a
lot
of
intense
scientific
thinking
done
beforehand
letting
ones
mind
roam
freely
and
giving
rein
to
ones
intuition
can
be
a
useful
way
of
coming
up
with
new
ideas
but
only
when
one
has
done
a
lot
of
rational
analysis
of
the
problem
first
scientific
intuition
is
not
something
one
is
born
with
it
is
something
that
one
learns
maybe
we
dont
understand
completely
how
it
is
learned
but
training
in
systematic
scientific
thinking
is
certainly
one
of
the
key
elements
in
developing
it
informal
exploration
is
also
often
an
important
element
in
finding
new
scientific
ideas
one
thinks
for
instance
of
darwins
naturalistic
studies
in
the
galapagos
islands
which
led
him
to
the
ideas
for
the

this
is
why
i
am
offended
by
a
definition
of
science
that
emphasizes
empirical
verification
and
does
not
recognize
thinking
and
informal
exploration
as

scientific
work
i
agree
that
mere
speculation
does
not
deserve
to
be
called
science
i
also
think
that
mere
empirical
studies
not
directed
by
good
scientific

are

see
the
ulterior
motive
here
it
is
easy
for
me
to
see
it
the
those
physicians
who
call
everything
lyme
and
treat
everything
there
is
a
lot
of
money
involved
you
keep
bringing
this
up
but
i
dont
understand
whats
in
it
financially
for
the
physician
to
go
ahead
and
treat
unless
the
physician
has
an
investment
in
or
is
involved
in
some
kickback
scheme
with
the
home
infusion
company
where
is
the
financial
gain
for
the
doctor
well
let
me
put
it
this
way
based
on
my
own
experience
a
general
practitioner
with
no
training
in
infectious
diseases
by
establishing
links
to
the
lyme
community
treating
patients
who
come
to
him
wondering
about
lyme
or
having
decided
they
have
lyme
as
if
they
did
saying
that
diseases
such
as
ms
are
probably
spirochetal
if
not
lyme
giving
talks
at
meetings
of
users
groups
validating
the
feelings
of
even
delusional
patients
etc
this
gp
can
go
from
being
a
runofthemill
gp
to
someone
with
lots
of
patients
in
the
hospital
and
getting
expensive
infusions
that
need
monitoring
in
his
office
and
making
lots
of
bread
also
getting
the
adulation
of
many
who
believe
his
is
their
only
hope
if
not
of
cure
then
of
control
and
seeing
his
name
in
publications
put
out
by
support
groups
etc
this
is
a
definite
temptation
harumph
getting
published
in
these
newsletters
is
hardly
something
to
aspire
to
i
cant
really
argue
with
your
logic
though
i
think
you
may
be
extrapolating
a
bit
recklessly
from
what
appears
to
be
a
sample
size
of
one
even
if
what
you
say
about
this
local
pittsburgh
guy
is
true
it
is
not
logical
or
fair
to
conclude
that
this
is
true
of
all
doctors
who
treat
lyme
disease
by
your
logic
i
could
conclude
that
all
of
the
physicians
who
consult
for
insurance
companies
and
make
money
by
denying
benefits
to
lyme
patients
are
doing
it
for
the
money
rather
than
because
they
believe
they
are
encouraging
good
medicine
i
have
no
idea
how
sincere
these
guys
are
but
their
motives
are
as
suspect
as
the
physicians
you
excoriate
for
what
you
believe
to
be
indiscriminate
treatment
i
would
really
feel
more
comfortable
discussing
the
medical
issues
in
lyme
rather
than
speculating
as
to
the
motives
of
the
various
parties
involved
gordon

wednesday

k
of
c
uniondale
last
meeting
it
has
been
noted
here
before
that
the
long
island
chapter
of
trio
has
extraordinary
power
in
predicting
bad
weather
being
able
to
forecast
rain
sleet
and
snow
fully
a
month
in
advance
no
tv
weatherman
can
match
us
this
time
we
not
only
scored
again
but
we
were
also
able
to
disable
the
long
island
railroad
making
travel
really
difficult
none
the
less
many
braved
the
snow
and
we
had
an
interesting
meeting
and
good
conversation
our
scheduled
speaker
mrs
elizabeth
linnehan
a
professional
nutritionist
had
a
family
emergency
and
was
not
able
to
attend
she
hope
she
will
be
with
us
in
the
fall
to
discuss
diet
and
medications
however
ms
jennifer
friedman
an
image
consultant
and
sister
of
a
liver
transplant
recipient
was
kind
enough
to
step
in
on
very
short
notice
ms
friedman
gave
us
a
lot
of
good
advice
about
choosing
clothes
and
makeup
even
a
bit
for
men
to
help
us
look
well
and
healthy
and
to
minimize
some
of
the
cosmetic
effects
of
some
of
the
medicine
and
drugs
we
take
we
are
most
grateful
to
jennifer
and
thank
her
for
an
entertaining
evening
annual
meeting
in
addition
to
welcoming
dr

the
april

is
also
the
annual
meeting
of
the
chapter
this
is
the
official
notice
of
the
meeting
as
required
by
our
bylaws
the
main
purpose
of
the
meeting
is
to
review
the
past
year
solicit
member
views
and
ideas
for
better
ways
to
meet
their
needs
and
to
elect
members
of
the
board
of
directors
for
the
coming
two

this
may
seem
to
be
a
big
board
but
many
hands
make
light
work
and
with
our
various
medical
uncertainties
it
is
good
to
have
backups
for
all
the
jobs
on
the
board
therefore
in
addition
to
the
slate
being
presented
for
voting
nominations
will
also
be
accepted
from
the
floor
there
is
no
set
number
of
board
members
and
there
is
plenty
of
work
in
addition
brief
treasurers
and
membership
reports
will
be
given
and
the
floor
will
be
open
for
any
new
business
suggestions
or
comments
anyone
would
like
to
bring
up
we
will
keep
the
formal
meeting
short
so
that
we
can
spend

can
help
spread

we
have
found
it
effective
to
ask
your

re
what
are
the
problems
with
nutrasweet
aspartame
in
article
hbloommooseuvmedu
heather
writes
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
aspartame
is
the
methyl
ester
of
a
dipeptide
so
a
product
of
its
hydrolysis
is
going
to
be
methanol
which
can
then
be
oxidized
to
formaldehyde
the
amounts
of
methanol
formed
from
the
ingestion
of
aspartamecontaining
foods
are
completely
in
the
metabolic
noise
since
youre
forming
equally
minute
amounts
of
methanol
from
other
components
of
food
all
the
time
in
studies
involving
administration
of
high
doses
of
the
additive
blood
methanol
levels
were
undetectable
methanol
is
a
poison
only
in
quantities
seen
in
human
poisonings
say
and
above
this
is
a
consequence
of
its
oxidation
to
formaldehyde
and
formic
acid
two
quite
reactive
compounds
which
at
high
enough
levels
can
damage
tissues
like
the
retina
and
kidney
because
at
such
high
doses
the
bodys
detoxification
system
is
overwhelmed
interestingly
one
treatment
for
early
methanol
poisoning
is
to
get
the
person
drunk
on
ethyl
alcoholvodka
or
an
equivalent
thats
because
ethanol
is
metabolized
preferentially
over
methanol
by
the
enzymes
in
the
liver
if
the
methanol
stays
as
methanol
and
isnt
metabolized
to
formaldehyde
it
is
actually
relatively
nontoxic

many

responded
with

i
think
its
safe
to

the
original

is
already
familiar

stories
presumably
he
wants
hard
info
to
substantiate
or
refute
claims
about

making

there
has
been
no
hard
info
provided
about
msg
making

thats
the
point
after
all
like
youself
someone
who
can
read
a
scientific
paper
and
apparently
come
away
from
it
with
bizarrely
cracked
ideas
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
this
substance
in
human
nutrition
have
you
read
olneys
work
i
fail
to
see
how
citing
results
from
peerreviewed
studies
qualifies
as
bizarrely
cracked
thats
because
these
peerreviewed
studies
are
not
addressing
the
effects
of
msg
in
people
theyre
looking
at
animal
models
you
cant
walk
away
from
this
and
start
ranting
about
gloom
and
doom
as
if
there
were
any
documented
deleterious
health
effects
demonstrated
in
humans
note
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
argument
with
a
statement
like
noting
that
animal
administration
has
pro
duced
the
following
blah
blah
we
must
be
careful
about
its
use
in
humans
this
is
precisely
not
what
you
said
tests
have
been
done
on
rhesus
monkeys
as
well
i
have
never
seen
a
study
where
the
mode
of
administration
was
intraventricular
the
glu
and
asp
were
administered
orally
some
studies
used
iv
and
sc
intraventricular
is
not
a
normal
admin
method
for
food
tox
studies
for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not
have
read
the
peerreviewed
works
that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with
this
brain
injection
bunk
it
most
certainly
is
for
neurotoxicology
you
know
studies
of
glutamate
involve
more
than
food
science
pardon
me
but
where
are
you
getting
this
from
have
you
read
the
journals
have
you
done
a
thorough
literature
search
so
point
us
to
the
studies
in
humans
please
im
familiar
with
the
literature
and
ive
never
seen
any
which
relate
at
all
to
olneys
work
in
animals
and
the
effects
of
glutamate
on
neurons
the
point
is
exceeding
the
window
of
course
theyre
amino
acids
note
that
people
with
pku
cannot
tolerate
any
phenylalanine
well
actually
they
have
to
tolerate
some
phenylalanine
its
a
essential
amino
acid
they
just
try
to
get
as
little
as
is
healthy
without
producing
dangerous
levels
of
phenylalanine
and
its
metabolites
in
the
blood
olneys
research
compared
infant
human
diets
specifically
the
amount
of
freely
available
glu
in
mothers
milk
versus
commercial
baby
foods
vs
typical
lunch
items
from
the
standard
american
diet
such
as
packaged
soup
mixes
he
found
that
one
could
exceed
the
projected
safety
margin
for
infant
humans
by
at
least
fourfold
in
a
single
meal
of
processed
foods
mothers
milk
was
well
below
the
effective
dose
goodness
im
not
saying
that
its
good
to
feed
infants
a
lot
of
glutamatesupplemented
foods
its
just
that
this
projected
safety
margin
is
a
construct
derived
from
animal
models
and
given
that
you
can
prove
anything
you
like
were
talking
prudent
policy
in
infant
nutrition
here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as
received
wisdom
read
olneys
review
paper
in
prog
brain
res
and
check
his
sources
they
are
impecable
there
is
no
dispute
impeccable
there
most
certainly
is
a
dispute
between
who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide
peerreviewed
nonfoodindustryfunded
citations
to
articles
disputing
that
msg
has
no
effects
whatsoever
you
mean
asserting
youre
being
intellectually
dishonest
or
just
plain
confused
because
youre
conflating
reports
which
do
not
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
olneys
reports
would
argue
a
potential
for
problems
in
human
infants
but
thats
not
to
say
that
this
says
anything
whatsoever
about
the
use
of
msg
in
most
foods
nor
does
he
provide
any
studies
in
humans
which
indicate
any

for
obvious
reasons
it
says
nothing
about
msgs
contribtion
to
the

of

it
says

had
hemorrhoids
but
his
pharmacist
friend
sold
him
some
pills
incredulously
i
asked
to
look
at
them
and
sure
enough
these
contained
rutin
as
the
active
ingredient
i
probably
destroyed
the
placebo
effect
from
my
skeptical
sputtering
i
have
no
idea
how
hes
doing
hemorrhoidwise
these
days
the
studies
which
attempted
to
look
at
the
effect
of
these
compounds
in
human
disease
and
nutrition
were
never
very
well
controlled
so
the
reports
of
positive
results
with
them
is
mostly
anecdotal
this
stuff
is
pretty
much
nontoxic
and
probably
inexpensive
so
theres
little
risk
of
trying
it
but
i
wouldnt
expect
much
of
a
result

i

with
everything
that
lee

wrote
in
her
previous
post
in
this
thread
gee
maybe
ive
misjudged
you
russell
anyone
who
agrees
with
something
i
say
cant
be
all
bad
seriously
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudged
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insistence
that
science
is
mainly
about
avoiding
mistakes
and
i
still
disagree
with
your
contention
that
nobody
who
doesnt
use
methods
deemed
scientific
can
possibly
know
whats
true
and
whats
not
deleted
material
which
i
agree
with
back
to
lee
lady
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
these
posters
are
making
the
mistake
that
i
have
previously
criticized
of
adhering
to
a
methodological
recipe
a
carefully
rules
such
as
support
the
hypothesis
by
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
are
too
narrow
to
apply
to
all
investigation
i
think
that
the
requirements
for
particular
reasoning
to
be
convincing
depends
greatly
on
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
past
reasoning
about
the
same
kinds
of
things
to
reuse
the
previous
example
we
know
that
conclusions
from
uncontrolled
observations
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medical
problems
are
notoriously
problematic
okay
so
lets
see
if
we
agree
on
this
first
of
all
there
are
degrees
of
certainty
it
might
be
appropriate
for
instance
to
demand
carefully
controlled
trials
before
we
accept
as
absolute
scientific
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highly
favorable
clinical
experience
even
if
uncontrolled
can
be
adequate
to
justify
a
preliminary
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
useful
this
is
often
the
best
evidence
we
can
hope
for
from
investigators
who
do
not
have
institutional
or
corporate
support
in
this
case
it
makes
sense
to
tentatively
treat
claims
as
credible
but
to
reserve
final
judgement
until
establishment
scientists
who
are
qualified
and
have
the
necessary
resources
can
do
more
careful
testing
secondly
it
makes
sense
to
be
more
tolerant
in
our
standards
of
evidence
for
a
pronounced
effect
than
for
one
that
is
marginal
i
come
to
this
dispute
about
what
science
is
not
only
as
a
mathematician
but
as
a
veteran
of
many
arguments
in
scipsychology
and
occasionally
in
scimed
about
nlp
neurolinguistic
programming
much
of
the
work
done
to
date
by
nlpers
can
be
better
categorized
as
informal
exploration
than
as
careful
scientific
research
for
years
now
i
have
been
trying
to
get
scientific
and
clinical
psychologists
to
just
take
a
look
at
it
to
read
a
few
of
the
books
and
watch
some
of
the
videotapes
courtesy
of
your
local
university
library
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
definitive
judgement
but
simply
to
look
at
the
nlp
methodology
especially
the
approach
to
eliciting
information
from
subjects
and
look
for
ideas
and
hypotheses
which
might
be
of
scientific
interest
and
most
especially
to
be
aware
of
the
questions
nlp
suggests
which
might
be
worthy
of
scientific
investigation
over
and
over
again
the
response
i
get
in
scipychology
is
if
this
hasnt
been
thoroughly
validated
by
the
accepted
form
of
empirical
research
then
it
cant
be
of
any
interest
to
us
to
me
the
ultimate
reducio
ad
absurdum
of
the
extreme
thereve
got
to
be
controlled
studies
position
is
an
nlp
technique
called
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
simple
phobias
as
opposed
to
agoraphobia
may
not
be
the
worlds
most
important
psychological
disorder
but
the
nice
thing
about
them
is
that
it
doesnt
take
a
sophisticated
instrument
to
diagnose
them
or
tell
when
someone
is
cured
of
one
the
nlp
phobia
cure
is
a
simple
visualization
which
requires
less
than
minutes
nlpers
claim
that
it
can
also
be
used
to
neutralize
a
traumatic
memory
and
hence
is
useful
in
treating
posttraumatic
stress
syndrome
it
is
essentially
a
variation
on
the
classic
desensitization
process
used
by
behavioral
therapists
a
subject
only
needs
to
be
taken
through
the
technique
once
or
in
the
case
of
ptsd
once
for
each
traumatic
incident
the
process
doesnt
need
to
be
repeated
and
the
subject
doesnt
need
to
practice
it
over
again
at
home
now
to
me
it
seems
pretty
easy
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
this
cure
especially
if
as
nlpers
claim
the
success
rate
is
extremely
high
take
someone
with
a
fear
of
heights
as
i
used
to
have
take
them
up
to
a
balcony
on
the
floor
and
observe
their
response
spend
minutes
to
have
them
do
the
simple
visualization
send
them
back
up
to
the
balcony
and
see
if
things
have
changed
check
back
with
them
in
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
the
cure
seems
to
be
lasting
more
long
term
followup
is
certainly
desirable
but
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
even
a
cure
that
lasts
several
weeks
has
significance
in
any
case
there
are
many
known
cases
where
the
cure
has
lasted
years
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
is
no
known
case
where
the
cure
has
been
reversed
after
holding
for
a
few
weeks
my
own
cure
incidentally
was
done
with
a
slightly
different
nlp
technique
before
i
learned
of
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
ten
years
later
now
i
enjoy
living
on
the
floor
of
my
building
and
having
a
large
balcony
the
folks
over
in
scipsychology
have
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
not
to
make
this
simple
test
they
claim
that
only
an
elaborate
outcome
study
will
be
satisfactory
a
study
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practitioners
many
of
whom
make
a
barely
marginal
living
from
their
practice
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interested
because
the
whole
idea
seems
frivolous
and
since
theyre
not
part
of
the
scientific
establishment
they
have
no
tangible
rewards
to
gain
from
scientific
acceptance
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
is
over
ten
years
old
now
and
the
clinical
psychology
establishment
is
still
saying
we
dont
have
any
way
of
knowing
that
its
effective
these
academics
themselves
have
the
resources
to
do
a
study
as
elaborate
as
anyone
could
want
of
course
but
they
say
why
should
i
prove
your
theory
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
one
making
the
claim
one
academic
in
scipsychology
said
that
it
would
be
completely
unscientific
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
since
it
hasnt
been
described
in
a
scientific
journal
its
described
in
a
number
of
books
and
ive
posted
articles
in
scipsychology
describing
it
in
as
much
detail
as
im
capable
of
actually
at
least
one
fairly
careful
academic
study
has
been
done
with
favorable
results
but
its
apparently
not
acceptable
because
its
a
doctoral
dissertation
and
not
published
in
a
refereed
journal
to
me
this
sort
of
attitude
does
not
advance
science
but
hinders
it
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
when
i
talk
about
doctrinnaire
attitudes
about
science
now
maybe
i
have
been
unfair
in
imputing
such
attitudes
to
you
russell
if
so
i
apologize
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a

competing

repeat
after

we

all
individuals
subject
re
barbecued
foods
and
health
risk
rsilverworldstdcom
richard
silver
writes
some
recent
postings
remind
me
that
i
had
read
about
risks
associated
with
the
barbecuing
of
foods
namely
that
carcinogens
are
generated
is
this
a
valid
concern
if
so
is
it
a
function
of
the
smoke
or
the
elevated
temperatures
is
it
a
function
of
the
cooking
elements
wood
or
charcoal
vs
lava
rocks
i
wish
to
know
more
thanks
i
recall
that
the
issue
is
that
fat
on
the
meat
liquifies
and
then
drips
down
onto
the
hot
elementswhatever
they
arethat
the
extreme
heat
then
catalyzes
something
in
the
fat
into
one
or
more
carcinogens
which
then
are
carried
back
up
onto
the
meat
in
the
smoke
the
ol
professor
subject
re
barbecued
foods
and
health
risk
this
reminds
me
of
the
last
graham
kerr
cooking
show
i
saw
today
he
smoked
meat
on
the
stovetop
in
a
big
pot
he
used
a
strange
technique
id
never
seen
before
he
took
a
big
pot
with
lid
and
placed
a
tray
in
it
made
from
aluminum
foil
the
tray
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
typical
coffeetable
ash
tray
made
by
crumpling
a
sheet
of
foil
around
the
edges
in
the
tray
he
placed
a
couple
spoonfuls
of
brown
sugar
a
similar
quantity
of
brown
rice
he
said
any
rice
will
do
the
contents
of
two
teabags
of
earl
grey
tea
and
a
few
cloves
on
top
of
this
was
placed
an
ordinary
aluminum
baskettype
steamer
with
two
chicken
breasts
in
it
the
lid
was
put
on
and
the
whole
assembly
went
on
the
stovetop
at
high
heat
for
or
minutes
later
he
removed
what
looked
like
smoked
chicken
breasts
what
surprises
and
concerns
me
are
no
wood
chips
where
does
the
smoke
flavor
come
from
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
hearing
that
carmel
color
obtained
by
caramelizing
sugar
a
common
coloring
and
flavoring
agent
had
been
found
to
be
carcinogenic
i
believe
they
injected
it
under
the
skin
of
rats
or
something
if
the
results
were
conclusive
caramel
color
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
yet
it
is
still
being
used
was
the
initial
research
result
found
to
be
incorrect
or
what
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
earl
grey
tea
being
implicated
as
carcinogenic
because
it
contains
oil
of
bergamot
an
extract
from
the
skin
of
a
type
of
citrus
fruit
does
anyone
know
whatever
happened
with
that
story
if
it
were
carcinogenic
earl
grey
tea
could
not
have
it
as
an
additive
yet
it
apparently
continues
to
do
so
wrt
natural
wood
smoke
ive
smoking
a
duck
right
now
as
it
happens
ive
noticed
that
a
heavilysmoked
food
item
will
have
an
unpleasant
tangy
taste
when
eaten
directly
out
of
the
smoker
if
the
smoke
has
only
recently
stopped
flowing
i
find
the
best
taste
to
be
had
by
using
dry
wood
chips
getting
lots
of
smoke
right
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
process
then
slowly
barbequing
for
hours
and
hours
without
adding
additional
wood
chips
my
theory
is
that
the
unpleasant
tangy
molecules
are
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
like
terpenes
and
that
the
smoky
flavor
molecules
are
some
sort
of
larger
molecule
more
similar
to
tar
the
long
barbeque
time
after
the
initial
intensive
smoke
drives
off
the
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
just
leaving
the
flavor
behind
does
anyone
know
if
my
theory
is
correct
i
also
remember
hearing
that
the
combustion
products
of
fat
dripping
on
the
charcoal
and
burning
are
carcinogenic
for
that
reason
and
because
it
covers
the
product
with
soot
and
some
unpleasant
tanginess
i
only
grill
nondrippy
meats
like
prawns
directly
over
hot
coals
i
do
stuff
like
this
duck
by
indirect
heat
i
have
a
long
rectangular
weber
and
i
put
the
coals
at
one
end
and
the
meat
at
the
other
end
the
fat
drops
directly
on
the
floor
below
the
meat
and
next
time
i
use
the
barbeque
i
make
the
fire
in
that
end
to
burn
off
the
fat
and
help
ignite
the
coals
and
yet
another
reason
ive
heard
not
to
smoke
or
barbeque
meat
is
that
smoked
cured
meat
like
pork
sausage
and
bacon
contains
nitrosamines
which
are
carcinogenic
im
pretty
sure
this
claim
actually
has
some
standing
dont
know
about
the
others
an
amusing
incident
i
recall
was
the
duncan
hines
scandal
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
people
who
make
duncan
hines
cake
mix
were
putting
a
lot
of
ethylene
dibromide
edb
into
the
cake
mix
to
suppress
weevils
this
is
a
fumigant
which
is
known
to
be
carcinogenic
the
guy
who
represented
the
company
in
the
press
conference
defended
himself
by
saying
that
the
risk
from
eating
duncan
hines
products
every
day
for
a
year
would
be
equal
to
the
cancer
risk
from
eating
two
charcoal
broiled
steaks
what
a
great
analogy
when
i
first
heard
that
my
immediate
reaction
was
we
should
make
that
a
standard
unit
one
charcoal
broiled
steak
would
be
equivalent

hbloommooseuvmedu
heather
writes
nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic
sweetener
a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the
body
produces
when
it
degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the
degredation
pathway
that
the
body
uses
to
eliminate
substances
the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of
methanol
and
formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are
toxic
to
living
cells
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
will
not
consume
it
phenylalanine
is
nothing
for
you
to
worry
about
it
is
an
amino
acid
and
everyone
uses
small
quantities
of
it
for
protein
synthesis
in
the
body
some
people
have
a
disease
known
as
phenylketoneurea
and
they
are
missing
the
enzyme
necessary
to
degrade
this
compound
and
eliminate
it
from
the
body
for
them
it
will
accumulate
in
the
body
and
in
high
levels
this
is
toxic
to
growing
nerve
cells
therefore
it
is
only
a
major
problem
in
young
children
until
around
age
or
so
or
women
who
are
pregnant
and
have
this
disorder
it
used
to
be
a
leading
cause
of
brain
damage
in
infants
but
now
it
can
be
easily
detected
at
birth
and
then
one
must
simply
avoid
comsumption
of
phenylalanine
as
a
child
or
when
pregnant
heather

pku
syndrome
in

is
about

those

gordon

the

the
greatest
hazard
of
barbecuing
is
that
the
cook
will
not
use
enough
caution
and
get
burned
some
people
suggest
that
the
barbecuing
itself
is
dangerous
because
the
smoke
which
is
absorbed
by
the
meat
contains
benzopyrene
which
in
its
pure
form
has
been
known
to
cause
cancer
in
laboratory
animals
however
in
order
to
experience
the
same
results
people
would
have
to
consume
unrealistically
large
quantities
of
barbecued

nutrasweet
is
a
synthetic

a
couple
thousand
times
sweeter
than
sugar
some
people
are
concerned
about
the
chemicals
that
the

produces
when

degrades
nutrasweet
it
is
thought
to
form
formaldehyde
and
known
to
for
methanol
in
the

that
the

uses

the
real
issue
is
whether
the
levels
of

formaldehyde
produced
are
high
enough
to
cause
significant
damage
as
both
are

is
that
i

not

in
the

is
a
three
page
article
about
artificial
sweeteners
what
follows
are
those
excerpts
which
deal
specifically
with
nutrasweet
reproduced
without
permission
the
controversy
over
aspartame
began
six
years
ago
in
england
where
a
group
of
researchers
found
that
aspartame
marketed
under
the
tradename
nutrasweet
appears
to
stimulate
appetite
and
presumably
the
eating
of
more
calories
in
the
long
run
than
if
a
person
simply
consumed
sugar
when
researchers
asked
a
group
of
people
to
drink
plain
water
aspartamesweetened
water
and
sugared
water
they
said
that
overall
they
felt
hungriest
after
drinking
the
artificially
sweetened
beverage
the
study
received
widespread
media
attention
and
stirred
a
good
deal
of
concern
among
the
artificialsweetenerusing
public
however
its
results
were
questionable
at
best
since
the
researchers
did
not
go
on
to
measure
whether
the
increase
in
appetite
did
actually
translate
into
an
increase
in
eating
the
two
do
not
necessarily
go
hand
in
hand
in
the
years
that
followed
more
than
a
dozen
studies
examining
the
effect
of
aspartame
on
appetite
and
eating
were
conducted
and
after
reviewing
every
one
of
them
the
director
of
the
laboratory
of
the
study
of
human
ingestive
behavior
at
johns
hopkins
university
barbara
rolls
phd
concluded
that
consuming
aspartame
sweetened
foods
and
drinks
is
not
associated
with
any
increase
in
the
amount
of
food
eaten
afterward
one
artificial
sweetener
that
is
not
typically
accused
of
causing
cancer
is
aspartame
but
it
most
certainly
has
been
blamed
for
a
host
of
other
ills
since
its
introduction
in
the
government
has
received
thousands
of
complaints
accusing
it
of
causing
everything
from
headaches
to
nausea
to
mood
swings
to
anxiety
still
years
of
careful
scientific
study
conducted
both
before
and

ksthis
apparently
is

and
different
symptons
eg
kschest
complaints
are
treated
separately
does
anone
have
any
information
im
not
sure
that
this
condition
is
recognised
anywhere
in
the
sense
of
a
disease
with
diagnostic
criteria
clear
boundaries
between
it
and
other
diseases
unique
pathologic
or
physiologic
features
etc
but
here
goes
with
what
many
neurologists
agree
on
postpolio
syndrome
patients
have
evidence
of
motor
neuron
disease
by
clinical
examination
emg
and
muscle
biopsy
the
abnormalities
are
mostly
chronic
due
to
old
polio
but
there
is
evidence
of
ongoing
deterioration
clinically
the
patients
complain
of
declining
strength
and
endurance
with
everyday
motor
tasks
musculoskeletal
pain
is
a
nearly
universal
feature
that
doubtless
contributes
to
the
impaired
performance
the
examination
shows
muscle
weakness
and
atrophy
the
emg
shows
evidence
of
old
denervation
with
reinnervation
giant
and
longduration
motor
unit
action
potentials
and
evidence
of
active
denervation
fibrillation
potentials
the
biopsy
also
shows
old
denervation
with
reinnervation
fibertype
grouping
and
evidence
of
active
denervation
small
angulated
fibers
with
dense
oxidative
enzyme
staining
but
curiously
little
or
no
group
atrophy
postpolio
patients
do
not
have
als
in
als
there
is
clinically
evident
deterioration
from
one
month
to
the
next
in
postpolio
the
patients
are
remarkably
stable
in
objective
findings
from
one
year
to
the
next
of
course
there
are
patients
who
had
polio
before
who
develop
genuine
als
but
als
is
no
more
common
among
polio
survivors
than
among
people
who
never
had
polio
the
cause
of
postpolio
syndrome
is
unknown
there
is
little
evidence
that
postpolio
patients
have
active
polio
virus
or
destructive
immunologic
response
to
virus
antigen
there
is
no
solid
evidence
that
patients
with
postpolio
have
anything
different
happening
to
the
motor
unit
anterior
horn
cells
motor
axons
neuromuscular
junctions
and
muscle
fibers
than
patients
with
old
polio
who
are
not
complaining
of
deterioration
both
groups
can
have
the
same
emg
and
biopsy
findings
the
reason
for
these
acute
changes
in
a
chronic
disease
old
polio
is
unknown
possibly
spinal
motor
neurons
that
have
reinnervated
huge
numbers
of
muscle
fibers
start
shedding
the
load
after
several
years
there
are
a
couple
of
clinical
features
that
distinguish
postpolio
syndrome
patients
from
patients
with
old
polio
who
deny
deterioration
the
pps
patients
are
more
likely
to
have
had
severe
polio
the
pps
patients
are
much
more
likely
to
complain
of
pain
they
also
tend
to
score
higher
on
depression
scales
of
neuropsychologic
tests
my
take
on
this
im
sure
some
will
disagree
after
recovery
from
severe
polio
there
can
be
abnormal
loading
on
muscles
tendons
ligaments
bones
and
joints
that
leads
to
inflammatory
andor
degenerative
conditions
affecting
these
structures
the
increasing
pain
superimposed
on
the
chronic
but
unchanging
weakness
leads
to
progressive
impairment
of
motor
performance
and
adl
i
am
perhaps
biased
by
personal
experience
of
having
never
seen
a
pps
patient
who
was
not
limited
in
some
way
by
pain
i
do
not
believe
that
pps
patients
have
more
rapid
deterioration
of
motor
units
than
nonpps
patients
ie
those
with
old
polio
of
similar
severity
but
without
pps
complaints

so

conceivable
therefore
having
as
many
genes
as
possible
available
is
a
good
strategy
for
species
survival
of
course
the
status
of
genetically
altered
individuals
would
start
out
as
no
different
than
anyone
elses
but
if
we
could
make
philosopherkings
with
great
bodies
and
long
lives
would
we
or
they
want
to
give
them
elevated
status
we
could
the
romans
did
it
with
their
kings
without
the
benefits
of
such
eugenics
the
race
eventually
realized
and
dealt
with
the
problems
which
that
caused
but
for
a
while
it
was
a
problem
orwell
introduced
us
to
the
notion
of
what
might
happen
to
persons
genetically
altered
for
more
menial
tasks
but
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
we
treated
slaves
the
same
way
for
millennia
before
i
see
no
inherent
problem
with
gene
therapy
which
avoids
at
least
these
problems
humans
have
always
had
trouble
having
the
virtue
and
wisdom
to
use
any
power
that
falls
into
their
hands
to
good
ends
all
the
time
that
hasnt
stopped
the
race
as
a
whole
yet
many
are
the
civilizations
which
have
died
from
inability
to
adapt
to
environmental
change
however
also
many
are
the
civilizations
which
have
died
from
the
abuse
of
their
own
power
the
ones
which
survived
have
hopefully
learned
a
lesson
from
the
fates
of
others
and
have
survived
by
making
better
choices
when
their
turns
came
not
that
i
dont
think
that
this
gene
altering
power
couldnt
wipe
us
off
the
face
of
the
earth
or
cause
endless
suffering
nuclear
power
or
global
warming
or
whatever
could
and
may
still
do
that
too
the
real
issue
is
an
issue
of
wisdom
and
virtue
i
personally
dont
think
man
has
enough
wisdom
and
virtue
to
pull
this
next
challenge
off
any
better
than
he
did
the
for
last
few
we
as
eugenists
may
make
it
an
we
may
not
if
we
dont
i
hope
there
are
reservoirs
of
garbage
people
out
in
some
backwater
with
otherwise
long
discarded
garbage
genes
which
will
pull
us
through
i
believe
that
the
real
problem
is
and
will
probably
always
be
the
same
man
needs
to
accept
input
from
the
great
spirit
of
god
to
overcome
his
lacks
in
the
area
of
knowing
how
to
use
the
power
he
has
some
men
have
and
i
believe
all
men
may
listen
to
and
obey
the
still
small
voice
of
god
in
their
hearts
this
is
the
way
to
begin
to
recieve
the
wisdom
and
virtue
needed
to
escape
the
problems
consequent
to
poor
choices
peoples
have
died
out
for
many
reasons
the
societies
which
failed
to
accept
enough
input
from
god
to
safely
use
the
power
they
had
developed
have
destroyed
themselves
and
often
others
in
the
process
it
is
selfevident
that
the
ones
which
survive
today
have
either
accepted
enough
input
from
the
spirit
to
use
their
powers
wisely
enough
to
avoid
or
survive
their
own
mistakes
thus
far
or
else
havent
had
enough
power
for
long
enough
in
summary
i
would
say
that
the
question
of
whether
to
use
this
new
technology
is
really
an
ancient
one
and
the
answer
in
some
ways
hard
in
some
ways
easy
is
the
same
ancient
answer
it
isnt
the
power
it
is
the
spirit

it
does
imply

and
which
are
not

with

or

is

so
theres
a
question
of
how
much
certainty
we
are
willing
to
pay
for
in
a
given
context
insistence
on
too
much
rigor
bogs
science
down
completely
and
makes
progress
impossible
expenditure
of
sufficiently
large
sums
of
money
and
amounts
of
time
can
sometimes
overcome
this
on
the
other
hand
with
too
little
rigor
much
is
lost
by
basing
work
on
results
which
eventually
turn
out
to
be
false
there
is
a
morass
of
studies
contradicting
other
studies
and
outsiders
start
saying
you
people
call
this
science
my
opinion
for
what
its
worth
is
that
one
sees
both
these
phenomena
happening
simultaneously
in
some
parts
of
psychology
some
subjective
judgement
is
required
to
decide
on
the
level
of
rigor
appropriate
for
a
particular
investigation
i
dont
believe
it
is
ever
possible
to
banish
subjective
judgement
from
science
my
second
point
though
is
that
highly
capable
people
can
often
make
extremely
reliable
judgements
about
scientific
validity
even
when
using
methodology
considered
inadequate
by
the
usual
standards
i
think
this
is
true
of
many
scientists
and
i
think
it
is
true
of
many
who
approach
their
discipline
in
a
way
that
is
not
generally
recognized
as
scientific
within
mathematics
i
think
there
are
several
examples
especially
before
the
twentieth
century
one
conspicuous
case
is
that
of
riemann
who
is
famous
for
many
theorems
he
stated
but
did
not
prove
later
mathematicians
did
prove
them
of
course
i
think
that
for
a
good
scientist
empirical
investigation
is
often
not
so
much
a
matter
of
determining
what
is
true
and
whats
not
as
it
is
a
matter
of
convincing
other
people
people
have
proposed
lots
of
incompatible
definitions
of
science
here
but
i
think
the
ability
to
objectively
convince
others
of
the
validity
of
ones
results
is
an
essential
element
not
that
one
can
necessarily
do
that
at
every
step
of
the
scientific
process
but
i
think
that
if
one
is
not
moving
toward
that
goal
then
one
is
not
doing
science
when
a
person
other
than
a
scientist
is
quite
good
at
what
he
does
and
seems
to
be
very
successful
at
it
i
think
that
his
judgements
are
also
worthy
of
respect
and
that
his
assertions
are
well
worth
further
investigation
in
article
i
wrote
namely
is
there
really
justification
for
the
belief
that
science
is
a
superior
path
to
truth
than
nonscientific
approaches
admittedly
my
question
was
not
at
all
well
posed
a
considerable
amount
of
effort
in
a
serious
scholarly
investigation
such
as
i
suggested
would
be
required
simply
to
formulate
an
appropriately
specific
question
to
try
and
answer
the
science
i
was
thinking
of
in
my
question
is
the
actual
science
currently
practiced
now
in
the
last
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
i
certainly
wasnt
thinking
of
some
idealized
science
or
the
mere
use
of
reason
and
observation
one
thing
i
had
in
mind
in
my
suggestion
was
the
question
as
to
whether
in
many
cases
the
subjective
judgements
of
skilled
and
experienced
practitioners
might
be
more
reliable
than
statistical
studies
since
russell
turpin
seems
to
be
much
more
familiar
than
i
am
with
the
study
of
scientific
methodology
perhaps
he
can
tell
us
if
there
is
any
existing
research
related
to
this
question
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects

critique

as

below
is
a
personal
critique
of
a
pressure
point
massager
i
recently
bought
from
the
self
care
catalog
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
results
the
catalog
description
is
as
follows
the
pressure
point
massager
is
an
aggressive
physical
massager
that
actually
kneads
the
tension
out
of
muscles
much
like
a
professional
shiatsu
masseur
the
powerful
motor
drives
two
counterrotating
thumbs
that
move
in
oneinch
orbits
releasing
tension
in

and

pressure
point
massager
to
order
or
receive
a
catalog
call
hours
days
or
fax
at
note
when
i
ordered
the
massager
the
item
number
was
different
and
the
price
was
not
when
i
received
it
i
glanced
thru
the
newer
catalog
enclosed
with
it
to
see
anything
was
different
from
the
first
one
i
was
quite
annoyed
to
see
a
difference
in
price
i
called
them
about
it
and
the
cust
rep
said
that
they
had
switched
manufacturers
although
it
looks
and
works
exactly
the
same
he
told
me
to
go
ahead
and
return
the
first
one
and
order
the
cheaper
one
using
the
price
difference
as
a
reason
for
return
in
fact
since
the
newer
ones
might
take
a
while
to
ship
from
the
factory
i
received
this
one
in
days
he
told
me
i
could
use
the
one
i
already
have
until
the
new
one
arrives
then
return
the
old
one
very
reasonable
people
i
have
longterm
neck
shoulder
and
back
pain
if
i
were
a
building
i
would
be
described
as
structurally
unsound
i
have
stretches
and
exercises
to
do
that
help
but
the
problem
never
really
goes
away
if
for
whatever
reason
i
do
not
exercise
for
a
while
illness
not
enough
time
lazy
etc
the
muscles
become
quite
stiff
and
painful
and
thus
more
prone
to
further
strain
even
with
exercise
i
sometimes
require
physical
therapy
to
get
back
on
track
which
requires
a
doctor
visit
to
get
the
prescription
for
pt
the
tension
in
my
neck
if
not
released
eventually
causes
a
headache
sometimes
confused
with
a
sinus
headache
over
my
left
eye
when
my
physical
therapist
has
massaged
my
neck
and
the
suboccipital
muscles
in
particular
the
knobby
areas
near
the
base
of
the
skull
the
headache
usually
eased
within
a
day
although
it
hurts
like
hell
to
while
it
is
being
massaged
i
ordered
this
device
because
it
seemed
to
be
exactly
what
i
was
wishing
someone
would
invent
a
machine
that
would
massage
not
vibrate
my
neck
and
suboccipital
muscles
like
my
physical
therapist
has
done
in
the
past
that
i
could
use
by
myself
no
doctor
visit
or
inconvenient
pt
appts
for
a
week
later
would
be
needed
to
use
it
i
could
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
use
it
if
necessary
i
have
been
using
it
for
about
a
week
or
so
now
and
love
it
the
base
unit
is
about
a
x
rectangle
about
high
with
handles
on
each
side
and
it
plugs
into
an
average
outlet
the
two
metal
thumbs
are
about
in
diameter
and
protrude
about
above
the
base
the
thumbs
are
covered
with
a
gray
cloth
that
is
nonremovable
they
are
located
more
toward
one
end
rather
than
centered
see
figure
below
they
move
in
either
clockwise
or
counterclockwise
directions
depending
on
which
side
of
the
switch
is
pushed
and
are
very
quiet
it
can
be
used
from
either
side
for
instance
the
thumbs
can
be
positioned
at
the
base
of
the
neck
or
the
top
of
the
neck
depending
on
which
direction
you
approach
it
for
the
neckhead
the
user
varies
the
amount
of
pressure
used
by
if
laying
down
allowing
all
or
part
of
the
full
weight
of
the
head
andor
neck
to
rest
on
the
thumbs
the
handles
can
also
be
used
if
sitting
or
standing
applying
pressure
with
the
armswrists
since
my
wrists
are
also
impaired
im
typing
this
over
an
extended
period
of
time
and
i
dont
have
someone
living
with
me
who
can
apply
it
laying
down
works
well
for
me
for
my
back
i
sit
in
a
highbacked
kitchen
chair
position
the
massager
behind
me
at
whatever
point
i
want
massaged
and
lean
back
lightly
or
not
so
lightly
against
it
the
pressure
of
leaning
back
holds
it
in
place
if
i
want
to
massage
the
entire
spine
i
simply
move
it
down
a
few
inches
whenever
i
feel
like
it
for
my
back
this
machine
is
far
superior
to
use
than
the
commonly
used
homemade
massager
of
tennis
balls
taped
together
with
the
balls
position
against
a
wall
or
door
them
over
the
spine
and
move
the
body
up
and
down
against
them
the
tennis
balls
are
better
than
nothing
but
difficult
to
use
for
very
long
especially
if
your
quads
are
not
in
good
shape
and
my
long
hair
gets
painfully
in
the
way
if
i
dont
pin
it
up
first
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
easier
something
like
this
is
to
use
the
more
likely
ill
usedo
it
if
there
are
multiple
considerationshassles
im
more
likely
to
not
bother
with
it
not
only
has
this
machine
helped
with
my
headaches
but
my
range
of
motion
for
my
neck
and
back
are
greatly
increased
the
first
time
i
used
it
on
my
necksuboccipital
muscles
however
i
overdid
it
and
pressed
too
hard
against
it
which
resulted
in
a
very
tender
almost
bruised
area
for
a
few
days
i
laid
off
it
for
about
days
and
applied
ice
which
helped
after
that
i
was
more
gradual
about
applying
pressure
at
this
point
the
pain
in
the
suboccipital
area
is
now
minimal
while
being
massaged
i
also
learned
to
use
very
light
pressure
on
my
lower
back
which
is
the
most
vulnerable
point
for
me
it
also
eased
some
painful
knots
of
tension
between
my

blades
although
again
it
took
a
few
days
of
massaging
just
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
to
really
work
it
out
i
highly
recommend
this
product
if
you
have
similar
problems
although
i
cannot
vouch
for
its
durability
it
seems
pretty
sturdy
since
ive
had
it
such
a
short
time
i
plan
to
use
it
not
only
to
ease
tension
but
also
to
loosen
the
muscls
before
exercising
and
maybe
after
too
i
have
been
ill
recently
and
not
able
to
exercise
much
for
a
few
weeks
so
this
was
very
timely
for
me
this
is
the
product
ive
ordered
from
this
company
and
only
recently
became
aware
of
it
thru
a
coworker
the
catalog
states
they
have
been
in
business
since
it
contains
quite
a
few
health
care
products
and
while
they
appear
to
be
more
expensive
than
the
average
health
care
catalog
products
they
also
appear
to
be
of
much
higher
quality
with
more
thought
put
into
what
they
actually
do
definitely
a
step
above
some
other
ones
ive
seen
such
as
dr
leonards
health
care
catalog
or
mature
wisdom
im
only
but
have
ended
up
on
some
geriatrictype
mailing
lists
no
big
surprise
here
i
consider
many
of
those
products
to
be
ripoffs
particularly
targeted
toward
the
elderly
with
dubious
health
benefits
i
apologize
for
the
length
of
this
but
its
the
kind

i
would
like
to
know

placebo

the

where

and
the

administering
it

also
an

the

dislikesdistrusts

therefore
doesnt

my

the
theory
as

that

from

would
a

is

the
body
evicts
the

the

apparently
enhance

blocking
capability

try

thats

quibble
about
what
id
like

doing

not
the
post
hoc
constructed
reasons
but
the
thoughts
in
his
head
as
he
considered
the
problem
it
may
be
this
smacks
a
bit
of
ideology
the
supposition
being
that
toricellis
subsequent
descriptions
of
his
reasoning
are
not
veridical
it
gets
dangerously
close
to
an
unfalsifiable
view
of
the
history
and
methodology
of
science
if
we
deny
that
no
subsequent
reports
of

are
reliable
descriptions

impossible
to
know
much
about
toricellis
thoughts
thats
too
bad
if
it
is
so
one
of
rootbernsteins
services
to
science
is
that
he
has
gone
rooting
about
in
pasteurs
and
flemings
and
other
peoples
notes
and
has
discovered
some
surprising
clues
about
their
motivations
pasteur
never
publicly
admitted
his
plan
to
create
mirrorimage
life
but
the
dreams
are
right
there
in
his
notebooks
finally
public
after
many
years
ready
for
anyone
to
read
and
i
and
my
friends
often
have
the
most
ridiculous
reasons
for
pursuing
results
one
of
my
best
came
because
i
was
mad
at
a
colleague
for
a
poorlywritten
claim
i
disproved
the
claim
of
course
toricellis
case
may
be
an
example
of
a
rarety
where
the
fantasy
not
only
motivates
the
experiment
but
turns
out
to
be
right
in
the
end
but
my
point
is
that
this
type
of
case
is
not
a
rarity
in
fact
i
was
going
to
point
to
pasteur
as
yet
another
rather
common
example
particularly
the
studies
on
spontaneous
generation
and
fermentation
i
will
readily
concede
that
ridiculous
reasons
can
play
an
important
role
in
how
scientists
spend
their
time
but
one
should
not
confuse
motivation
with
methodology
nor
suppose
that
ridiculous
reasons
provide
the
impetus

my

i
are
in

process
of
selecting
a
pediatrician
for
our

child
due
june
we
interviewed
a
young
doctor
last
week
and
were
very
impressed
with
her
however
i
discovered
that
she
is
actually
not
an
medical
doctor
md
but
rather
a
doctor
of
osteopathy
do
whats
the
difference
i
believe
the
pediatrician
i
went
to
for
many
years
was
a
do
and
he
didnt
seem
different
from
any
other
doctor
ive
seen
over
the
years
my
dictionary
says
that
osteopathy
is
a
medical
therapy
that
emphasizes
manipulative
techniques
for
correcting
somatic
abnormalities
thought
to
cause
disease
and
inhibit
recovery
jeez
this
sounds
like
chiropractic
i
remember
getting
shots
and
medicine
from
my
pediatrician
do
and
dont
remember
any
manipulative
techniques
perhaps
someone
could
enlighten
me
as
to
the
real
practical
difference
between
an
md
and
a
do
also
im
interesting

hearing

opinions

this
reminds
me
of
the
last
graham
kerr
cooking
show
i
saw
today
he
smoked
meat
on
the
stovetop
in
a
big
pot
he
used
a
strange
technique
id
never
seen
before
he
took
a
big
pot
with
lid
and
placed
a
tray
in
it
made
from
aluminum
foil
the
tray
was
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
typical
coffeetable
ash
tray
made
by
crumpling
a
sheet
of
foil
around
the
edges
in
the
tray
he
placed
a
couple
spoonfuls
of
brown
sugar
a
similar
quantity
of
brown
rice
he
said
any
rice
will
do
the
contents
of
two
teabags
of
earl
grey
tea
and
a
few
cloves
on
top
of
this
was
placed
an
ordinary
aluminum
baskettype
steamer
with
two
chicken
breasts
in
it
the
lid
was
put
on
and
the
whole
assembly
went
on
the
stovetop
at
high
heat
for
or
minutes
later
he
removed
what
looked
like
smoked
chicken
breasts
what
surprises
and
concerns
me
are
no
wood
chips
where
does
the
smoke
flavor
come
from
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
hearing
that
carmel
color
obtained
by
caramelizing
sugar
a
common
coloring
and
flavoring
agent
had
been
found
to
be
carcinogenic
i
believe
they
injected
it
under
the
skin
of
rats
or
something
if
the
results
were
conclusive
caramel
color
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
yet
it
is
still
being
used
was
the
initial
research
result
found
to
be
incorrect
or
what
about
or
years
ago
i
remember
earl
grey
tea
being
implicated
as
carcinogenic
because
it
contains
oil
of
bergamot
an
extract
from
the
skin
of
a
type
of
citrus
fruit
does
anyone
know
whatever
happened
with
that
story
if
it
were
carcinogenic
earl
grey
tea
could
not
have
it
as
an
additive
yet
it
apparently
continues
to
do
so
wrt
natural
wood
smoke
ive
smoking
a
duck
right
now
as
it
happens
ive
noticed
that
a
heavilysmoked
food
item
will
have
an
unpleasant
tangy
taste
when
eaten
directly
out
of
the
smoker
if
the
smoke
has
only
recently
stopped
flowing
i
find
the
best
taste
to
be
had
by
using
dry
wood
chips
getting
lots
of
smoke
right
up
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
process
then
slowly
barbequing
for
hours
and
hours
without
adding
additional
wood
chips
my
theory
is
that
the
unpleasant
tangy
molecules
are
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
like
terpenes
and
that
the
smoky
flavor
molecules
are
some
sort
of
larger
molecule
more
similar
to
tar
the
long
barbeque
time
after
the
initial
intensive
smoke
drives
off
the
lowmolecular
weight
stuff
just
leaving
the
flavor
behind
does
anyone
know
if
my
theory
is
correct
i
also
remember
hearing
that
the
combustion
products
of
fat
dripping
on
the
charcoal
and
burning
are
carcinogenic
for
that
reason
and
because
it
covers
the
product
with
soot
and
some
unpleasant
tanginess
i
only
grill
nondrippy
meats
like
prawns
directly
over
hot
coals
i
do
stuff
like
this
duck
by
indirect
heat
i
have
a
long
rectangular
weber
and
i
put
the
coals
at
one
end
and
the
meat
at
the
other
end
the
fat
drops
directly
on
the
floor
below
the
meat
and
next
time
i
use
the
barbeque
i
make
the
fire
in
that
end
to
burn
off
the
fat
and
help
ignite
the
coals
and
yet
another
reason
ive
heard
not
to
smoke
or
barbeque
meat
is
that
smoked
cured
meat
like
pork
sausage
and
bacon
contains
nitrosamines
which
are
carcinogenic
im
pretty
sure
this
claim
actually
has
some
standing
dont
know
about
the
others
an
amusing
incident
i
recall
was
the
duncan
hines
scandal
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
people
who
make
duncan
hines
cake
mix
were
putting
a
lot
of
ethylene
dibromide
edb
into
the
cake
mix
to
suppress
weevils
this
is
a
fumigant
which
is
known
to
be
carcinogenic
the
guy
who
represented
the
company
in
the
press
conference
defended
himself
by
saying
that
the
risk
from
eating
duncan
hines
products
every
day
for
a
year
would
be
equal
to
the
cancer
risk
from
eating
two
charcoal
broiled
steaks
what
a
great
analogy
when
i
first
heard
that
my
immediate
reaction
was
we
should
make
that
a
standard
unit
one
charcoal
broiled
steak
would
be
equivalent
to
duncans
i
dont
understand
the
assumption
that
because
something
is
found
to
be
carcinogenic
that
it
would
not
be
legal
in
the
us
i
think
that
naturally
occuring
substances
excluding
controlled
substances
are
pretty
much
unregulated
in
terms
of
their
use
as
food
food
additives
or
other
consumption
its
only
when
the
chemists
concoct
sp
an
ingredient
that
it
falls
under
fda
regulations
otherwise
if
they
really
looked
closely
they
would
find
a
reason
to
ban
almost
everything
how
in

do
you
suppose
its

the

doesnt

and
then
sees

what
would
this

be
called
have
these
effects
ever
been
studied
how
common
are
these
effects
thank
you
in
advance
for
all
replies
these
effects
are
a
very
real
concern
in
conducting
studies
of
new
treatments
researchers
try
to
limit
this
kind
of
effect
by
performing
studies
that
are
blind
in
various
ways
some
of
these
are
o
the
subjects
of
the
study
do
not
know
whether
they
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
ie
whether
they
are
in
the
control
group
or
the
test
group
o
those
administering
the
treatment
do
not
know
which
subjects
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
o
those
evaluating
individual
results
do
not
know
which
subjects
receive
a
placebo
or
the
test
treatment
obviously
at
the
point
at
which
the
data
is
analyzed
one
has
to
differentiate
the
test
group
from
the
control
group
but
the
analysis
is
quasipublic
the
researcher
describes
it
and
presents
the
data
on
which
it
is
based
so
that
others
can
verify
it
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
biological
studies
where
the
subjects
are
animals
such
as
mice
there
were
many
cases
of
skewed
results
because
those
who
performed
the
study
did
not
blind
themselves
it
is
not
considered
so
important
to
make
mice
more
ignorant
than
they
already
are
though
it
is
important
that
in
all
respects
except
the
one
tested
the
control
and
test
groups
are
treated
alike

the
theory

was
backed

that

it

food
per

since
kathryn

never

any

in

she
has
always
been
very
calm

dare
i

the
fact
that
this
happened
while

sugar
coated

made

makes
me

might
be
having
an

something
in

of
the

of

kathryn

we
have
a

mushrooms
anyway
our

chemistry
but
so
far
no
more
sugar
coated

and
no

a

in

the

was
repaired
using

method
and
a

and

the

considered
the
procedure
a

a

returned

said

could

occurs
more

now
says

i
think
that
part
of
the

is
that
i
have
proposed
a
definition
of
science
that
i
intended
to
be
interpreted
broadly
and
that
lee
lady
has
interpreted
fairly
narrowly
my
definition
is
this
science
is
the
investigation
of
the
empirical
that
avoids
mistakes
in
reasoning
and
methodology
discovered
from
previous
work

seriously
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudged
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insistence
that
science
is
mainly
about
avoiding
mistakes
here
is
where
i
think
we
are
talking
at
crosspurposes
it
is
not
clear
to
me
that
the
kind
of
definition
i
have
proposed
should
be
taken
as
describing
what
science
is
mainly
about
consider
for
example
a
definition
of
invertebrates
as
all
animals
lacking
a
backbone
this
fairly
tells
what
is
an
invertebrate
and
what
is
not
an
invertebrate
but
it
hardly
tells
you
what
invertebrates
are
all
about
one
can
read
this
definition
and
still
not
know
that
of
all
animal
species
are
invertebrates
that
invertebrates
possess
a
remarkably
broad
range
of
form
that
some
invertebrate
groups
such
as
insects
and
nematodes
are
ubiquitous
in
all
ecosystems
etc
in
short
knowing
the
definition
of
invertebrates
does
not
tell
one
what
they
are
mainly
about
the
misunderstanding
here
is
my
fault
i
did
not
give
sufficient
context
for
people
to
understand
my
proposed
definition
okay
so
lets
see
if
we
agree
on
this
first
of
all
there
are
degrees
of
certainty
it
might
be
appropriate
for
instance
to
demand
carefully
controlled
trials
before
we
accept
as
absolute
scientific
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highly
favorable
clinical
experience
even
if
uncontrolled
can
be
adequate
to
justify
a
preliminary
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
useful
secondly
it
makes
sense
to
be
more
tolerant
in
our
standards
of
evidence
for
a
pronounced
effect
than
for
one
that
is
marginal
i
agree
on
both
counts
as
an
example
of
the
second
it
would
only
take
a
few
cases
of
curing
rabies
to
convince
most
veterinarians
that
a
treatment
was
effective
despite
a
lack
of
controls
as
to
the
first
i
do
not
think
it
is
useful
to
talk
about
absolute
scientific
truth
i
think
it
is
more
useful
to
talk
about
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
various
claims
have
and
the
kinds
of
evidence
in
particular
fields
that
in
the
past
have
proven
faulty
or
reliable
the
latter
is
obviously
a
matter
of
degree
and
in
each
field
practitioners
try
to
discover
the
relevance
of
different
kinds
of
evidence
one
of
the
primary
mistakes
that
marks
the
advocacy
of
an
idea
as
psuedoscience
is
that
the
advocacy
lacks
any
sense
of
proportion
regarding
the
kinds
of
evidence
related
to
the
proposed
claim
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
actually
relevant
to
it
and
the
historical
reasons
in
the
field
that
certain
kinds
of
evidence
are
given
more
weight
than
others
it
is
perfectly
alright
to
speculate
i
have
read
quite
a
few
refereed
papers
that
speculated
left
and
right
but
the
authors
were
careful
to
identify
the
notions
as
speculative
to
list
what
little
evidence
was
presently
available
for
them
and
to
describe
how
research
could
proceed
to
either
put
the
notion
on
more
firm
footing
or
to
uncover
its
problems
often
what
distinguishes
whether
a
paper
of
this
sort
passes
muster
is
the
thoughtfulness
with
which
the
author
sets
the
context
and
paves
the
way
for
future
work
it
is
in
this
area
that
many
proponents
of
speculative
ideas
fail
the
folks
over
in
scipsychology
have
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
not
to
make
this
simple
test
they
claim
that
only
an
elaborate
outcome
study
will
be
satisfactory
a
study
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practitioners
many
of
whom
make
a
barely
marginal
living
from
their
practice
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interested
because
the
whole
idea
seems
frivolous
and
since
theyre
not
part
of
the
scientific
establishment
they
have
no
tangible
rewards
to
gain
from
scientific
acceptance
i
think
a
lot
of
scientists
steer
away
from
things
that
deserving
or
not
garner
a
patina
of
kookiness
when
proponents
of
some
practice
see
no
value
in
more
careful
investigation
of
that
practice
that
sets
alarms
ringing
in
many
researchers
minds
this
is
unfortunate
because
there
is
undoubtedly
some
intersection
between
things
that
are
worth
investigating
and
things
that
are
advocated
by
those
who
seem
careless
or
unreasonable
in
their
advocacy
on
the
other
hand
i
can
understand
why
many
scientists
would
just
as
soon
select
other
directions
for
research
as
gordon
banks
has
pointed
out
no
one
wants
to
become
this
generations
rhine
one
academic
in
scipsychology
said
that
it
would
be
completely
unscientific
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
since
it
hasnt
been
described
in
a
scientific
journal
i
think
this
is
absurd
actually
at
least
one
fairly
careful
academic
study
has
been
done
with
favorable
results
but
its
apparently
not
acceptable
because
its
a
doctoral
dissertation
and
not
published
in
a
refereed
journal
i
wonder
why
the
results
were
not
published
in
my
field
dissertation
results
are
typically
summarized
in
papers
that
are
submitted
to
journals
often
the
papers
are
accepted
for
publication
before
the
dissertation
is
finished
this
certainly
eases
ones
defense

just
that

here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as

who
said
anything
about

is
no
question
that

doses
of

are
capable
of
destroying
nearly
all
neurons
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of

and
the

these
areas
are

for

critical
to

neuroendocrine
function
and
the
normal
development
of
the
vertabrate
organism
humans
are
vertebrates
now
what
pray

do
you
think
will
happen
when
the
area
of
the
brain
necessary
for
the
normal
rhythm
of
gonadotropin

is
missing
are
you
trying

me
of
that
part
of

that
is

controlling

albeit
indirectly
of
estradiol
and
testosterone
how
do
you
expect
anyone
to
do
the

on
this
its
unethical
to
sacrifice
humans
to
check
out
what
effects
chronic
acute
etc
doses
of
these
compounds
are
having
on
the
brain
tissue
in

the
food
industry
knows
this
thats
why
the

is
used
in

and
psych
if
youre
talking
about
straight
sensitivity
it
would
be
useful
to
define
the

there
are
plenty
of

the

between
attitude
and

we
may
be
arguing
about
separate
things
only
adult
sensitivities
you
and
lateoccuring
sequelae
of
childhood
ingestion
and
its
implication
for
adults
me
certainly
the
doses
for
excitotoxicity
in
adults
are
considerably
larger
than
for
the
young
but
the
additivity
of
glu
and
asp
and
their
copious
and
increased
presence
in
modern
processed
foods
jointly
and
their
hidden
presence
in

necessitates
extreme
caution
why
would
anyone
want
to
eat
compounds
which
have
been
shown
to
markedly
perturb
the
endocrine

in

the
main
point
is
blood
levels
attained

oral
doses
would

have
to
be
greater

who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide

no

a
putative
causal
mechanism
for
some
sensitivities
terry
epelbaum
and
martin
have
shown
that
orally
administered
msg
causes
changes
in
normal
gonadotropic
hormone
fluctutations
in
adults
glu
also
was
found
to
induce
immediate
and
persistant
supression
of
rhythmic
gh
secretion
and
to
induce
rapid
and
transient
release
of
prolactin
in
adults
chronically
exposed
to
msg
gh
is
responsible
not
only
for
control
of

during

also
converts

i
remember
a

friend

working

apparently

will
induce

whether
these

survive

i
dont

i
never

because
of

also
many

contain

it

i
dont

if
these

survive
the

would
they

are
pretty

unregulated
in

food

when

concoct

otherwise
if

they
would

in

do
you
suppose
its

tobacco
products
which
probably
should

no
there
is
something
called
the
delany
amendment
which
makes
carcinogenic
food
additives
illegal
in
any
amount
this
was
passed
by
congress
in
the
before
stuff
like
mass
spectrometry
became
available
which
increased
detectable
levels
of
substances
by
a
couple
orders
of
magnitude
this
is
why
things
like
cyclamates
and
red
were
banned
they
are
very
weakly
carcinogenic
in
huge
quantities
in
rats
so
under
the
act
they
are
banned
this
also
applies
to
natural
carcinogens

this
is

if
it
were
possible
to
market
a
root
beer
good
like
the
old
days
someone
would
do
it
in
order
to
make
money
the
fact
that
no
one
does
it
indicates
that
enforcement
is
still
in
effect
an
odd
exception
to
the
rule
seems
to
be
the

this

this

during

using
alternating
currents
of

to
illuminate
their

they
photographed
them
they
found
that
if
an
object
was
a
good
conductor
such
as
a
metal
the
picture
showed
only
its
surface
while
the
pictures
of
poor
conductors
showed
the
inner
structure
of
the
object
even
if
it
were
optically
opaque
they
found
too
that
these
high
frequency
pictures
could
distinguish
between
dead
and
living
objects
dead
ones
had
a
constant
outline
whilst

were

taken
it
up
seriously

douglas

in

have

and

using
kirlian
photography
it
is
possible
to
show
an
aura
around
peoples
fingers
notably
around
those
of
healers
who
are
concentrating
on
healing
someone
normally
blue
and
white
rays
emanate
from
the
fingers
but
when
a
subject
becomes
angry
or
excited
the
aura
turns
red
and
spotty
the
soviets
are
now
using
kirlian
photography
to
diagnose
diseases
which
cannot
be
diagnosed
by
any
other
method
they
argue
that
in
most
illnesses
there
is
a
preclinical
stage
during
which
the
person
isnt
actually
ill
but
is
about
to
be
they
claim
to
be
able
to
foretell
a
disease
by
photographing
its
preclinical
phase
but
the
most
exciting
phenomenon
illustrated
by
kirlian
photography
is
the
phantom
effect
during
high
frequency
photography
of
a
leaf
from
which
a
part
had
been
cut
the
photograph
gave
a
complete
picture
of
the
leaf
with
the
removed
part
showing
up
faintly
this
is
extremely
important
because
it
backs
up
the
experiences
of
psychics
who
can
see
the
legs
of
amputees
as
if
they
were
still
there
the
important
thing
about
the
kirlian
phantoms
though
is
that
the
electromagnetic
pattern
cant
possibly
represent
a
secondary
phenomenon
or
the
field
would
vanish
when
the
piece
of
leaf
or
leg
vanished
the
energy
grid
contained
in
a
living
object
must
therefore
be
far
more
significant
than
the
actual
object
itself
kirlian
photography
has
shown
how
water

gervais
subject
re
hernia
in
article
sheffnerencorecom
steve
heffner
writes
a
bit
more
than
a
year
ago
a
hernia
in
my
right
groin
was
discovered
it
had
produced
a
dull
pain
in
that
area
the
hernia
was
repaired
using
the
least
intrusive
orthoscopic
method
and
a
plug
and
patch
i
suspect
you
mean
laparoscopic
instead
of
orthoscopic
now
the
pain
occurs
more
often
my
gp
couldnt
identify
any
specific
problem
the
surgen
who
performed
the
original
procedure
now
says
that
yes
there
is
a
new
hernia
in
the
same
area
and
he
said
that
he
has
to
cut
into
the
area
for
the
repair
this
time
my
question
to
the
net
is
there
a
nonintrusive
method
to
determine
if
in
fact
there
is
a
hernia
or
if
the
pain
is
from
something
else
by
far
the
still
best
method
to
diagnose
a
hernia
is
old
fashioned
physical
examination
if
you
have
an
obvious
hernia
sac
coming
down
into
your
scrotum
or
a
bulge
in
your
groin
that
is
brought
about
by
increasing
intraabdominal
pressure
sometimes
is
not
that
obvious
the
hernia
is
small
and
you
can
only
detect
it
by
putting
your
finger
into
the
inguinal
canal
whether
you
have
a
recurrent
hernia
or
this
is
related
to
the
previous
operation
i
cant
tell
you
the
person
that
examined
you
is
in
the
best
position
to
make
that
determination
are
there
noninvasive
ways
of
diagnosing
a
hernia
every
now
and
then
folks
write
about
ct
scans
and
ultrasounds
for
this
but
these
are
far
too
expensive
and
unlikely
to
be
better
than
a
trained
examining
finger

doylepittedu
subject
re
lasers
for
dermatologists
it
is
not
true
that
dermatologists
gave
not
reached
the
laser
age
in
fact
lasers
in
dermatological
surgery
is
a
very
new
and
exciting
field
it
probably
wont
be
effective
in
tinea
pedis
because
the
laser
is
usually
a
superficial
burn
to
avoid
any
deeper
damage
limited
tinea
pedis
can
be
cured
albeit
sometimes
slowly
by
topical
antifungals
as
well
as
systemic
medication
ie
tablets
finally
a
selfdiagnosis
is
not
always
reliable
lichen
simplex
chronicus
can
look
like
a
fungal
infection
and
requires
very
different
treatment

is
there
a
righteye

as
there
is
an
overall
righthandedness
in
the
population
i
mean
do
most
people
require
less
lens
corrections
for
the
one
eye
than
the
other
if
so
what
kinds
of
percentages
can
be
attached
to
this
there
is
eye
dominance
same
as
handedness
and
usually
for
the
same
side
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
refractive
error
however
i
recall
readingseeing
that
former
baseball
star
chris
chambliss
hitting
abilities
were
in
part
attributed
to
a
combination
of
lefthandedness
righteye
dominance
i
was
part
of
a
study
a
few
years
ago
at
the
university
of
arizona
to
see
whether
cross
dominant
individuals
those
with
a
particular
handedness
but
who
had
dominance
in
the
opposite
eye
were
better
hitters
than
those
with
same
side
dominance
of
hand
and
eye
i
was
picked
from
my
softball
class
because
i
was
cross
dominant
right
hand
left
eye
which
put
me
in
a
small
minority
and
the
grad
student
was
trying
to
get
an
equal
number
of
cross
dominant
and
same
side
dominant
people
to
control
the
study
she
used
a
pitching
machine
fast
pitch
since
i
was
used
to
slow
pitch
i
didnt
come
close
actually
i
think
i
foul
tipped
a
few
to
hitting
the
ball
if
there
were
a
lot
of
people
like
me
in
her
study
ie
those
who
cant
hit
fast
pitch
or
are
not
used
to
hitting
off
a
machine
i
would
seriously
question
the
results
of
that
study
i
think
there
have
been
some
studies
of
major
league
players
across
a
fairly
large
cross
section
of
players
to
test
whether
eye
dominance
being
the
same
or
opposite
side
was
better
but
i
dont
know
the
results
the
woman
who
ran
the
study
i
was
in
said
that
there
was
a
higher
incidence
of
crossdominance
in
major
leaguers
than
across
the
general
population
but
im
not
sure
whether
id
believe

my
family
doctor
and
the
physiotherapist
pt
she
sent
me
to
agree
that
the
pain
in
my
left
shoulder
is
bursitis
i
have
an
appointment
with
an
orthpod
i
love
that
its
short
for
orthopedic
surgeon
apparently
but
while
im
waiting
the
pt
is
treating
me
shes
using
hot
packs
ultrasound
and
lasers
but
theres
no
improvement
yet
in
fact
i
almost
suspect
its
getting
worse
my
real
question
is
about
the
laser
treatment
i
cant
easily
imagine
what
the
physical
effect
that
could
have
on
a
deep
tissue
problem
can
anyone
shed
some
light
so
to
speak
on

if
it
works
its

in

sense
in

you
dont

krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
crullerian
photography
involves
putting
donuts
between
greasecovered
hot
metal
plates
while
illuminating
them
with
a
krypton
stroboscope
through
a
unique
iteration
involving
the
projection
of
a
torus
through
the
semistochastic
interactions
of
hot
monomolecular
lipid
layers
covering
the
metal
plates
the
best
metal
is
iron
since
it
repels
vampires

the
donuts
start
developing
flutes

within

actually
become

anyone

any

candida

in

this

not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by

there
is
a

talks

there
is
no

tenderizing

an

an
acute
anxiety

characterized
by
either
obsessions

cause
anxiety

compulsions
repetitive
ritualistic

similarly
cause
intense

ocd
is
often
associated
with
certain
forms

examples
of
obsessive

are
repeated
impulses
to
kill
a
loved
one
though
not
accompanied
by
anger

person
having
recurrent
blasphemous
thoughts
generally
the
individual
attempts
to
ignore

the

realizes
that
the

the
reason
im
posting
this
article
to
this
newsgroup
is
to
gather
any
information
about
this
disorder
from
anyone
who
might
have
recently
been
effected
by
it
from
being
associated
with
it
or
actually
having
this
disorder
and
help
me
find
out
where
i
can
access
any
medical
literature
associated
with
seizures
over
the
internet
recently
i
had
a
baby
boy
born
with
seizures
which
occured
hours
after
birth
he
was
immediately
transferred
to
a
major
hospital
in
boston
and
has
since
been
undergoing
extensive
drug
treatment
for
his
condition
this
has
been
a
major
learning
experience
for
me
and
my
wife
not
only
in
learning
the
medical
problems
that
faced
our
son
but
also
in
dealing
with
hospitals
proceduresetc
i
dont
want
to
go
into
a
lot
of
detail
but
his
condition
was
termed
quite
severe
at
first
then
slowly
he
began
to
grow
and
put
on
weight
as
a
normal
baby
would
he
was
put
on
the
standard
anticonvulsion
drugs
and
that
did
not
seem
to
help
out
his
mri
ekg
catscans
are
all
normal
but
the
eegs
show
alot
of
seizure
activity
after
many
metabolic
tests
body
structure
tests
and
infectionvirus
tests
the
doctors
still
do
not
know
quite
what
type
of
siezures
he
is
having
although
they
do
have
alot
of
evidence
that
it
is
now
pointing
to
infantile
spasms
this
is
where
we
stand
right
now
if
anyone
knows
of
any
database
or
newsgroup
or
as
i
mentioned
up
above
any
information
relating
to
this
disorder
i
would
sure
appreciate
hearing
from
you
i
am
not
trying
to
play
doctor
here
but
only
trying
to
gather
information
about
it
as
i
know
now
these
particular
types
of
disorders
are
still
not
really
well
understood
by
the
medical
community
and
so

someone
i

has

a
disease
about
which
i
can
find
no
information
apparently
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
bodys
production
of
yeast
while
at
the
same
time
being
highly
allergic
to
yeast
can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
any
more
about
it
candida
albicans
can
cause
severe
lifethreatening
infections
usually
in
people
who
are
otherwise
quite
ill
this
is
not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by
mainstream
medicine
there
is
a
book
the
yeast
connection
which
talks
about
this
illness
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
for
example
dr
ivker
who
wrote
the
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
before
any
other
treatment
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
nizoral
to
his
new
patients
if
theyve
been
on
braodspectrum
antibiotics
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
hes
kept
a
record
of
the
results
and
for
over
patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
in
my
case
it
was
sinus
since
thats
the
center
of
my
allergic
response
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned

dont

the

that
it

in

us
i
think
that
no
there
is
something
called
the
delany

which
makes
carcinogenic
food
additives
illegal
in
any
amount
this
was
passed
by

in
the
before
stuff
like
mass

became
available
which
increased
detectable

of
substances
by
a
couple
orders
of

this
is
why
things
like
cyclamates
and
red
were
banned
they
are
very
weakly
carcinogenic
in
huge
quantities
in
rats
so
under
the
act
they
are
banned
this
also
applies

if
it
were
possible
to

the

someone
would
do
it
in

the
fact
that
no

that

is
still

an
odd
exception
to
the
rule
seems
to
be
the
product
known
as
gumbo

this
is
nothing
more
than
coarsely
ground
dried
sassafras
leaves
this
is
not
only
a
natural
product
but
a
natural
product
still
in
its
natural
form
so
maybe
thats
how
they
evade
delany
or
maybe
a
special
exemption
was
made
to
appease
powerful
louisiana

i
think
what
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
even
though
it
may
be

the
blessing
of

researchers
have
found
that
eating
a
cup
of
yogurt
a
day
drastically
reduces
a
womans
chances

a

for
the

researchers
at

jewish
medical

new

recruited
women
who
suffered
from
chronic
yeast
infections
for
the
first
months
the
women
each
day
ate
ounces
of
yogurt
containing
lactobacillus
acidophilus
for
the
second
months
the
women
did
not
eat
yogurt
the
researchers
examined
the
women

found
that
incidents
of
colonization
and
infection
were
significantly
lower
during
the
period
when
the
women
ate
yogurt
the
fungus
candida
albicans
can
live
in
the
body
without
doing
harm
it
is
an
overproliferation
of
the
fungus
that
leads
to
infection
the
researchers
concluded
that
the
l
acidophilus
bacteria
found
in

retard
overgrowth
of
the
fungus
streptococcus
thermophilus
and
l
bulgaricus

the
two
bacteria
most
commonly
used
in

production
neither
one
appears
to
exert
a
protective
effect
against

however
women
who
want

candida
monilia
this
disease
is
usually
caused
by
candida
albicans
a
fungus
that
we
all
carry
at
one
time
or
another
in
some
circumstances
though
the
organisms
proliferate
producing
symptomatic
infection
of
the
mouth
intestines
vagina
or
skin
when
the
mouth
or
vagina
are
infected
the
disease
is
commonly
called
thrush
vaginitis
caused
by
candida
often
afflicts
women
on
birth
control
pills
or
antibiotics
there
is
itching
and
a
white
cheesy
discharge
among
narcotic
addicts
candida
infections
can
lead
to
heart
valve
inflammation
diagnosis
of
candida
infections
is
confirmed
by
cultures
and
blood
tests
treatment
can
be
with
amphotericin
b
or
orally
with
ketoconazole
there
is
no
evidence
that
candida
in
the
intestine
of
normal
individuals
leads
to
disease
all
people
at
one
time
or
another
have
candida
in
their
intestines
claims
for
any

from
special

now
im
not
saying
that
culturing
is
the
best
way
to
diagnose
its
very
hard
to
culture
bb
in
most
cases
the
point
is
that
dr
n
has
developed
a
feel
for
what
is
and
what
isnt
ld
this
comes
from
years
of
experience
no
serology
can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr
n
a
quack
and
accuse
him
of
trying
to
make
a
quick
buck
why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a
quack
the
quacks
dont
do
cultures
they
poopoo
doing

lab

this
is
lyme
believe
me
ive
seen
it
many
times
the
lab
tests
arent
accurate
well
treat
it
now
also
is
dr
ns
practice
almost
exclusively
devoted
to
treating

patients
i
dont
know
any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
are
you
arguing
that
the
lyme
lab
test
is
accurate
the
books
that
ive
read
say
that
in
general
the
tests
have
a
chance
of
being
correct
the
tests
result
in
a
large
number
of
both
false
positives
and
false
negatives
i
am
in

we

any

i
recently
attended
an

steroid

were

afterward
on

i
asked

what

work
nor
do
any

she
replied
that
she
saw
an
article
on
vasomotor
rhinitis
that
this
is
not
an
allergic
reaction
and
that
nothing
other
than
the
afrins
and
such
would
work
which
in
my
case
is
true
i
want
to
find
out
as
much
as
possible
about
this
since
i
am
going
to
see
my
allergist
in
may
and
want
to
be
armed
to
the
hilt
with
information
since
nothing
he
has
done
with
me
has
helped
me
at
all
and
i
have
had
no
relief
for
months
please
respond
if
you
know
anything
about
this
andor
please
let
me
know
what
articles
might
be
helpful
that
i
could
look
up
in
the
library
subject
bates
method
for
myopia
does
the
bates
method
work
i
first
heard
about
it
in
this
newsgroup
several
years
ago
and
i
have
just
got
hold
of
a
book
how
to
improve
your
sight
simple
daily
drills
in
relaxation
by
margaret
d
corbett
authorized
instructor
of
the
bates
method
published
in
it
talks
about
vision
improvement
by
relaxation
and
exercise
has
there
been
any
study
on
whether
this
method
actually
works
if
it
works
is
it
by
actually
shortening
the
previously
elongated
eyeball
or
by
increasing
the
lenss
ability
to
flatten
itself
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
toolong
eyeball
since
myopia
is
the
result
of
eyeball
elongation
seems
to
me
the
most
logical
approach
for
correction
is
to
find
a
way
to
reverse
the
process
ie
shorten
it
somehow
preferably
nonsurgically
has
there
been
any
recent
studies
on
this
where
can
i
find
them
i
know
rk
works
by
changing
the
curvature
of
the
cornea
to
compensate
for
the
shape
of
eyeball
but
if
there
is
a
way
to
train
the
muscles
to
shorten
the
eyeball
back
to
its
correct
length
that
would
be
even
better

there
is
no

such

theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
snort
ah
there
go
my
sinuses
again
for
example
dr
ivker
who
wrote
the
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
oh
wow
a
classic
textbook
hey
they
laughed
at
einstein
too
before
any
other
treatment
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
nizoral
to
his
new
patients
if
theyve
been
on
braodspectrum
antibiotics
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
hes
kept
a
record
of
the
results
and
for
over
patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
this
are
worthless
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typical
hysterichypochondriac
who
responds
to
miracle
cures
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
me
so
of
course
it
should
be
taken
seriously
snort
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
yeah
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
oh
really
what
tests
immunecompromised
my
ass
more
like
credulous
malingerer
this
is
a
psychiatric
syndrome
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
you
know
its
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazole
is
being
misused
in
this
way
its
ridiculously
expensive
and
potentially
toxic
the
trouble
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
gets
abused
by
quacks
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
the
only
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
and
when
taken
orally
nontoxic
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
any
systemic
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
any
effect
on
your
sinuses
i
wish
these
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
people
like
you
that
would
solve
the
yeast
problem
once
and
for
all
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
perhaps
a
little
haldol
would
go
a
long
way

ameliorating
your
symptoms
are

paying
for
this

vasomotor

decongestants

to
do
nothing
and
it
would
heal
up
with
no
long
term
effect
and
indeed
i
am
about
better
however
the
work
i
do
is
very
hard
and
i
am
still
not
able
to
go
back

the
thing
that

me
is
the

clunking
i
feel
and
hear
back
there
when
i
move
certain
ways
i
heard
some
one
talking
about
the
rib
they
broke
years
ago
and
that
it
still
bothers
them
any

relief
of
pain
caused
by
cancer
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
proper
group
to
post
this
to
but
here
goes
anyway
about
five
years
ago
my
mother
was
diagnosed
with
having
cancer
in
the
lymph
nodes
under
one
of
her
arms
after
the
doctors
removed
the
cancerous
area
she
had
full
movement
of
her
arm
with
only
slight
aching
under
her
arm
when
she
moved
it
over
the
course
of
the
next
two
years
the
aching
got
more
severe
and
her
complaining
to
the
doctors
produced
the
explanation
that
it
was
scar
tissue
causing
the
pain
at
this
time
her
doctor
suggested
that
some
physiotherapy
should
be
employed
to
break
up
the
scar
tissue
while
attending
one
of
her
therapy
sessions
while
her
arm
was
being
manipulated
some
damage
occured
nerve
which
caused
the
level
of
pain
to
permanently
increase
severly
controlled
by
tylenol
and
some
loss
of
use
of
the
arm
palsied
wrist
and
almost
no
outward
lateral
movement
with
great
persistence
on
her
part
the
doctors
looked
further
into
the
issue
and
discovered
that
not
all
of
the
cancer
had
been
removed
and
another
tumor
had
grown
under
the
arm
this
was
removed
also
but
the
pain
in
the
arm
has
not
decreased
the
doctors
are
not
sure
exactly
why
the
pain
is
persisting
but
feel
some
sort
of
nerve
damage
has
occured
and
they
have
employed
tylenol
and
soon
morphine
to
relieve
the
pain
she
has
tried
acupuncture
by
this
only
provides
minor
reductions
in
pain
and
is
only
short
term
my
questions
are
has
anyone
has
heard
of
similar
cases
and
what
if
anything
was
done
to
reduce
the
levels
of
pain
are
their
methods
to
block
nerves
so
that
the
pain
can
be
reduced
are
their
methods
to
restore
nerves
so
that
loss
of
arm
function
can
be
restored
any
general
suggestions
on
pain
reduction
would
be
greatly
appreciated
please
respond
by
email
because
i
do
not
always
get
chance
to
read
this
group
if
anyone
knows
of

that
may
be
useful
to
this
case
or

any

a

to

or
more
times
in

hes

found

over

his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
this
are
worthless
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typical
hysterichypochondriac
who
responds
to
miracle
cures
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
me
so
of
course
it
should
be
taken
seriously
snort
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
yeah
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
oh
really
what
tests
immunecompromised
my
ass
more
like
credulous
malingerer
this
is
a
psychiatric
syndrome
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
you
know
its
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazole
is
being
misused
in
this
way
its
ridiculously
expensive
and
potentially
toxic
the
trouble
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
gets
abused
by
quacks
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
the
only
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
and
when
taken
orally
nontoxic
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
any
systemic
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
any
effect
on
your
sinuses
i
wish
these
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
people
like
you
that
would
solve
the
yeast
problem
once
and
for
all
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some

medicine

scientific
endevour
its

practiced
in

most
early
treatment
of
nonlife
threatening
illness
is
done
on
a

hazarded
after
anecdotal
evidence
given
by

its

by

its
still
no
more
than
a

its
cheaper
and
simpler
to
medicate
first
and
only
deal
further
with
those
people
who
dont
respond
there
are
diseases
that
havent
been
described
yet
and
the
root
cause
of
many
diseases
now
described
arent
known
read
a
book
on
gastroenterology
sometime
if
you
want
to
see
a
lot
of
them
after
scientific
methods
have
run
out
then
its
the
patients
freedom
of
choice
to
try
any
experimental
method
they
choose
and
its
well
recognized
by
many
doctors
that
medicine
doesnt
have
all
the
answers
this
person
said
that
they
had
relief
by
taking
the

maybe
its
a

cure
maybe
its

the
funny
thing
is
the
personaly
stories
about
reactions
to
msg
vary
so
greatly
some
said
that
their
heart
beat
speeded
up
with
flush
face
some
claim
their
heart
skipped
beats
once
in
a
while
both
of
these
symptoms
are
related
tachycardia
getting
a
flushed
face
is
due
to
the
heart
pumping
the
blood
faster
than
a
regular
pulse
i
suspect
this
is
related
to
an
increase
in
sodium
levels
in
the
blood
since
note
sodium
chloride
monosodium
glutamate
both
are
sodium
compounds
our
bodies
require
sodium
but
like
everything
else
one
can
get
too
much
of
a
good
thing
some
reacted
with
headache
again
this
could
be
related
to
increased
blood
flow
from
increased
heart
rate
from
the
sodium
in
the
msg
distended
crainial
arteries
essentially
one
of
many
causes
of
headaches
there
is
no
discrepency
her
necessarily
some
stomach
ache
well
stomache
ache
and
vomiting
tend
to
be
related
again
not
necessarily
a
discrepency
more
likely
a
related
reaction
vomiting
occurs
as
a
response
to
get
rid
of
a
noxious
compound
an
organism
has
eaten
if
a
person
cant
digest
the
stuff
entirely
possible
the
list
of
stuff
people
are
allergic
to
is
quite
long
and
lacks
an
enzyme
to
break
it
down
gastrointestinal
distress
stomach
or
belly
ache
would
be
expected
some
had
watery
eyes
or
running
nose
these
are
respiratory
reactions
and
are
now
considered
to
be
similar
to
vomitting
they
are
a
way
for
the
body
to
dispose
of
noxious
compounds
they
are
adaptiove
responses
of
course
it
is
possible
some
other
food
or
environmental
compound
could
be
responsible
for
the
symptoms
but
its
important
to
remember
that
a
lot
opf
these
effets
can
be
additive
synergystic
subtractive
etc
etc
it
would
be
necessary
to
know
exactly
what
was
in
a
dish
and
what
else
the
person
was
exposed
to
respiratory
does
sound
suspicious
but
resopiration
and
heart
rate
are
connected
things
in
the
body
are
far
from
simplevery
inetractive
place
the
vertebrate
body
some
had
itchy
skin
or
rashes
people
respond
in
a
myriad
of
ways
to
the
same
compound
it
depends
upon
what
it
is
about
the
compound
that
pisses
off
their
body
pollen
for
example
of
some
plants
aggrivates
breathing
in
many
people
because
when
inhaled
it
sets
of
the
immune
system
and
an
histamine
attack
is
launched
the
immune
system
goes
overboard
causing
the
allergic
person
a
lot
of
misery
and
someone
with
an
allergy
to
some
pollens
will
have
trouble
with
some
herb
teas
that
contain
pollens
chamomile
linden
etc
drinking
the
substance
can
perturb
that
persons
system
as
much
as
inhaling
it
more
serious
accusations
include
respiration
difficulty
see
above
and
dont
think
that
heart
rate
changes
and
circulatory
problems
are
not
serious
they
can
be
deadly
and
brain
damage
the
area
of
the
brain
effected
is
the
neuroendocrine
system
controlling
the
release
of
gonadotropin
the
suprahormone
controlling
the
cyclical
release
of
testosterone
and
estradiol
as
well
as
somatostatin
and
other
steroids
testing
for
effective
dose
would
be
uh
a
wee
bit
unethical
now
here
is
a
new
one
vomiting
my
guess
is
that
msg
becomes
the
number
one
suspect
of
any
problem
in
this
case
it
might
be
just
food
poisoning
absolutely
but
it
could
also
be
some
synergystic
mess
from
eating
say
undetected
shrimp
or
mushrooms
to
which
many
are
allergic
plus
too
much
alcohol
and
inhaling
too
much
diesel
fumes

plus
lets
say
having
contracted
flu
from
ones
sig
other
days
before
from
drinking
out

could
be
all
sorts
of
things

it
might
be
the
msg
if
you
heard
things
about

you
may
think
it
must
be
it
if
noone
else
got

its
likely
not
food
poisoning
probably
stomach
flu
or
an
undetected
thing
the
guys

the

i

a

if
that

the

is
it

are
not

good

the

poor
quality
on
occasion
thats
probably
the
case

in
general
the
idea
is
that

improves
the

do
some
of
you
get
a
sadistic
pleasure
out

no
do
the

testers
have
some
defect
in

sensors
mouth
etc
that

corrects
no
i
really
dont

obviously
also
nitrosiamines
sp
as
i
recall
these
are
natural
byproducts
of
heating
up
certain
foods
they
dont
put

in
there
have
a
number
of
criteria
in
choosing
how
to
process
food
they
want
to
make
it
taste
good
look
good
sell
for
a
good
price
etc
the
fact
that
they
use
it
tells
me
that
they
think
that
it
contributes
to
those
goals
they
are
interested
in
one
of
those
goals
is
not
making
people
sick
such
a
goal
woud
quickly
drive
them
out
of
business
and
for
no
benefit
i
think
outlaw
the
use
of
these
substances
without
warning
labels
as
large
as
those
on
cig
packages
warning
of
what
in
california
there
is
a

requiring
that
anything
which
contains
a
carcinogen
be
labeled
that
includes
every
gasline
pump
most
foods
and
even
money
cleaning
machines
because
nickel
is
a
mild
carcinogen
the
result
is
that
now
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
any
of
the
warnings
require
of
comparable
products
on
the
market
to
be
free
of
these
substances
and
state
that
they
are
free
of

dyes
nitrosiamines
and
sulfites
on

why
what

my
question
i
have
been
to
a
doctor
and
was
told
that
it
was
best
to
do
nothing
and
it
would
heal
up
with
no

and
indeed
i
am
about
better
however
the

i
do
is
very
hard
and
i
am
still
not
able
to
go

the
thing
that
worries
me
is
the
movement

clunking
i
feel
and
hear
back
there
when
i
move
certain
ways
i
heard
some
one
talking
about
the
rib
they
broke
years
ago
and
that
it
still
bothers
them
any
opinions
your
doctor
is
right
it
is
best
to
do
nothing
besides
taking
some
pain
medication
initially
some
patients
dont
like
this
and
expect
or
demand
to
have
something
done
in
these
cases
some
physicians
will
tape
the
patient
put
a
lot
of
heavy
adhesive
tape
around
the
chest
or
prescribe
an
elastic
binder
all
this
does
is
make
it
harder
to
breath
but
the
patient
doesnt
feel
cheated
because
soemthing
is
being
done
about
the

alleviates

sudden
numbness
in
arm
i
experienced
a
sudden
numbness
in
my
left
arm
this
morning
just
after
i
completed
my
set
of
deep
squats
today
was
my
weight
training
day
and
i
was
just
beginning
my
routine
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
end
of
the
set
my
arm
felt
like
it
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
cold
turned
pale
and
lost
of
its
strength
the
weight
i
used
for
squats
wasnt
that
heavy
i
was
working
hard
but
not
at
effort
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
shake
the
arm
back
to
life
and
then
continued
with
chest
exercises
flyes
with
lighter
dumbells
than
i
normally
use
but
i
dropped
the
left
dumbell
during
the
first
set
and
experienced
continued
arm
weakness
into
the
second
so
i
quit
training
and
decided
not
to
do
my
usual
hour
on
the
ski
machine
either
ill
take
it
easy
for
the
rest
of
the
day
my
arm
is
still
somewhat
numb
and
significantly
weaker
than
normal
my
hand
still
tingles
a
bit
down
to
the
thumb
color
has
returned
to
normal
and
it
is
no
longer
cold
horrid
thoughts
of
chunks
of
plaque
blocking
a
major
artery
course
through
my
brain
im

fit
from
my

exercise
regimen
so
that
cant
be
it
could
a

nerve
from
the
bar
cause
these
symptoms
i
hope
has
this
happened
to
anyone
else
nothing

this
has
ever
happened

my

cut

badly

i
took
him
to
a

urgent

general
care
clinic
at
pm
the
clinic
was
open
till
pm
the
receptionist
went
to
the
back
and
told
the
doctor
that
we
were
there
and
came
back
and
told
us
the
doctor
would
not
see
us
because
she
had
someplace
to
go
at
and
did
not
want
to
be
delayed
here
during
the
next
few
minutes
in
response
to
my
questions
with
several
trips
to
the
back
room
the
receptionist
told
me
the
doctor
was
doing
paperwork
in
the
back
the
doctor
would
not
even
look
at
his
finger
to
advise
us
on
going
to
the
emergency
room
the
doctor
would
not
even
speak
to
me
she
would
not
tell
me
the
doctors
name
or
her
own
name
when
asked
who
is
in
charge
of
the
clinic
she
said
i
dont
know
i
realize
that
a
private
clinic
is
not
the
same
as
an
emergency
room
but
i
was
quite
angry
at
being
turned
away
because
the
doctor
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
my
son
did
get
three
stitches
at
the
emergency
room
im
still
trying
to
find
out
who
is

so
i
can

we
will

never

getting

most

these

tend

be

however
being
poorly
manufactured
and
too
sharp
in

opinion
they
tend
to
snag
bloodvessels
on

higher
quality

if

use
acupuncture
for

complaint
that

get
their

imitrex
and
heart
attacks
my
girlfriend
just
started
taking
imitrex
for
her
migraine
headaches
her
neurologist
diagnosed
her
as
having
depression
and
suffering
from
rebound
headaches
due
to
daily
doses
of
analgesics
she
stopped
taking
all
analgesics
and
caffine
as
of
last
thursday
the
weekend
was
pretty
bad
but
she
made
it
through
with
the
help
of
imitrex
about
every
hours
her
third
injection
of
imitrex
during
the
worst
of
the
withdrawl
on
friday
and
six
hours
after
the
first
of
the
day
left
her
very
sick
skin
was
flushed
sweating
vomiting
and
had
severe
headache
pain
it
subsided
in
an
hour
or
so
since
then
she
has
been
taking
imitrex
as
needed
to
control
the
pain
immediately
after
taking
it
she
has
increased
head
pain
for
ten
minutes
dizziness
and
mild
nausea
and
mild
chest
pains
a
friend
of
hers
mentioned
that
her
doctor
was
wary
of
imitrex
because
it
had
caused
heart
attacks
in
several
people
apparently
the
mild
chest
pains
were
common
in
these
other
people
prior
to
there
attacks
is
this
just
rumor
has
anyone
else
heard
of
these
symptoms
my
girlfriend
also
has
mitral
valve
prolapse
opinions
are
mine

never

try
chinese
food
however
i
finally
tried
some
in
order
to
please
a
girl
i
was
seeing
at
the
time
i
had
never
heard
of
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
a
group
of
us
went
to
the
restaurant
and
all
shared
different
dishes
it
didnt
taste
great
but
i
decided
it
wasnt
so
bad
we
went
home
and
went
to
bed
early
i
woke
up
at
am
and
puked
my
guts
outs
i
threw
up
for
so
long
that
im
not
kidding
i
pulled
a
muscle
in
my
tongue
dry
heaves
and
everything
no
one
else
got
sick
and
im
not
allergic
to
anything
that
i
know
of
suffice
to
say
that
i
wont
go
into
a
chinese
restaurant
unless
i
am
physically
threatened
the
smell
of
the
food
makes
me
ill
and
that
is
a
psycholgical
reaction
when
i
have
been
dragged
in

suffer
through
beef

without
any

i
insist

havent

whats
that
it
also
happened
when
she
pigged
out
on
some

which
i
noticed
later
had

i
experienced
a
sudden
numbness
in
my
left
arm
this
morning
just
after
i
completed
my
set
of
deep
squats
today
was
my
weight
training
day
and
i
was
just
beginning
my
routine
all
of
a
sudden
at
the
end
of
the
set
my
arm
felt
like
it
had
gone
to
sleep
it
was
cold
turned
pale
and
lost
of
its
strength
the
weight
i
used
for
squats
wasnt
that
heavy
i
was
working
hard
but
not
at
effort
i
waited
for
a
few
minutes
trying
to
shake
the
arm
back
to
life
and
then
continued
with
chest
exercises
flyes
with
lighter
dumbells
than
i
normally
use
but
i
dropped
the
left
dumbell
during
the
first
set
and
experienced
continued
arm
weakness
into
the
second
so
i
quit
training
and
decided
not
to
do
my
usual
hour
on
the
ski
machine
either
ill
take
it
easy
for
the
rest
of
the
day

arm
is
still
somewhat
numb
and
significantly
weaker
than
normal
my
hand
still
tingles
a
bit
down
to
the
thumb
color
has
returned
to
normal

it
is

so
that
cant

it
could
a

nerve
from
the
bar
cause
these
symptoms
i
hope
it
likely
has
nothing
to
do
with
chunks
of

but
it
sounds
like
you
may
have
a

compromise
to
your

you
need

editorial
note
the
increase
in
reported
gonorrhea
cases
in
colorado
in
may
represent
an
overall
increase
in
the
occurrence
of
this
disease
or
more
complete
reporting
stimulated
by
visitations
to
laboratories
by
cdh
surveillance
staff
during
the
increases
in
confirmed
gonorrhea
cases
at
dmhc
and
in
culturepositivity
rates
in
three
of
four
laboratories
suggest
a
real
increase
in
gonorrhea
rather
than
a
reporting
artifact
however
the
stable
culturepositivity
rate
in
the
nonprofit
family
planning
laboratory
which
serves
a
network
of
clinics
statewide
indicates
that
the
gonorrhea
increase
did
not
uniformly
affect
all
segments
of
the
population
one
possible
explanation
for
the
increased
occurrence
of
gonorrhea
in
colorado
may
be
gang
and
drugrelated
sexual
behavior
as
implicated
in
a
recent
outbreak
of
drugresistant
gonorrhea
and
other
stds
in
colorado
springs
although
the
high
morbidity
census
tracts
in
the
denver
metropolitan
area
coincide
with
areas
of
gang
and
drug
activity
this
hypothesis
requires
further
assessment
to
examine
the
possible
role
of
drug
use
implicated
previously
as
a
factor
contributing
to
the
national
increase
in
syphilis
the
cdh
stdaids
program
is
collecting
information
from
all
persons
in
whom
gonorrhea
is
diagnosed
regarding
drug
use
exchange
of
sex
for
money
or
drugs
and
gang
affiliation
the
gonorrhea
rate
for
blacks
in
colorado
substantially
exceeds
the
national
health
objective
for
the

per
objective
race
is
likely
a
risk
marker
rather
than
a

for
gonorrhea
and
other
stds
risk
markers
may
be
useful
for
identifying
groups
at
greatest
risk
for
stds
and
for

efforts
moreover

variation
in

may

indicating
that

in

couples
we
are
developing
the
technology
to
assist
couples
who
are
at
risk
for
producing
embryos
with

this

involves
biopsying

and
then
subjecting
the
biopsied
cells
to
genetic
analysis
using
either
dna
amplification
or
fluorescent
in

there
are
recent
reports
of
the
successful
application
of
dna
amplification
by
other

for

for

to

the
identification
of
which
will

for

who

the
considerable
clinical
application
of
such

lies
in
the
fact
that
it
circumvents
the

for

according
to
the
united

ivf

the
overall

rate
for
ivfet
nationwide
has
stabilized
at
about
percent
per
cycle
results
from
our
program
involving
patients
who
have
undergone
ivfet
cycles
reflect
a
comparable
success
rate
nevertheless
the
overall
incidence
of
success
with
this
procedure
is
disconcertingly
low
and
emphasizes
the
need
to
address
those
physiological
factors
that
limit
achievement
of
a
higher
percentage
of
pregnancies
well
recognized
predictors
of
outcome
include
patient
age
response
to
exogenous
ovarian
stimulation
quality
of
sperm
and
number
of
repeated
ivfet
cycle
attempts
however
among
these
age
is
the
single
most
significant
determinant
of
conception
therefore
it
is
critical
that
such
patients
are
referred
to
an
assisted
reproduction
program
at
the
earliest
opportunity
following
failure
of
traditional
therapies
the
underlying
basis
for
the
negative
effect
of
age
on
fertility
has
not
been
clearly
delineated
beyond
recognition
that
the
number
of
eggs
available
for
retrieval
declines
markedly
with
age
fertilization
rates
significantly
decrease
in
eggs
retrieved
from
patients
who
are
over
years
and
provided
the
appropriate
hormonal
background
is
present
age
is
unrelated
to
uterine
competency
to
sustain
pregnancy
ongoing
research
in
our
center
therefore
is
investigating
physiological
changes
in
the
egg
that
may
be
impacted
by
age
we
have
determined
that
more
than
percent
of
eggs
that
fail
to
fertilize
in
vitro
are
chromosomally
abnormal
and
that
a
significant
proportion
of
these
abnormalities
are
accountable
to
patient
age
currently
the
only
recourse
for
such
patients
is
to
use
eggs
obtained
from
a
donor
our
program
has
initiated
recruitment
of
volunteer
egg
donors
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
a
list
of
recipients
interested
in
this
form
of
therapy
gift
this
hightech
art
procedure
is
performed
in
the
operating
room
usually
with
the
use
of
a
laparoscope
and
in
contrast
to
ivfet
involves
introducing
sperm
and
freshly
retrieved
eggs
into
the
lumen
of
the
fallopian
tube
an
average
of
eggstube
under
these
circumstances
fertilization
occurs
in
vivo
and
if
excess
eggs
are
retrieved
the
remainder
undergo
ivf
with
subsequent
options
for
embryo
transfer
in
that
cycle
or
freezing
for
transfer
in
a
subsequent
cycle
this
art
procedure
is
applied
to

there

one
patent
fallopian

but
the

such

endometriosis
male

infertility
andor
idiopathic

the
data
reported
in
the
united

ivf
registry
for
through
indicate
that
the
overall
success
rate
with
gift
is
higher
than
that
obtained
with
the
ivfet
technique
range
of
clinical
pregnancies
for
gift
is
to
percent
and
for
ivfet
to
percent
in
view
of
this
fact
one
might
expect
more
patients
to
be
treated
with
gift
than
ivfet
however
in
our
program
we
have
taken
into
account
three
basic
concerns
which
while
substantially
reducing
the
number
of
gift
cycles
performed
benefit
the
patient
these
concerns
are
the
increased
costs
associated
with
performing
a
procedure
in
the
operating
room
the
risks
albeit
minimal
of
undergoing
general
anesthesia
and
the
considerable
benefits
to
be
accrued
from
obtaining
direct
information
on
the
quality
and
fertilizability
of
the
eggs
and
the
developmental
competency
of
resultant
embryos
the
increased
success
with
gift
undoubtedly
reflects
the
artificial
environment
provided
by
the
laboratory
in
the
ivfet
procedure
between
january
and
december
we
have
performed
a
total
of
gift
cycles
with
an
overall
success
rate
of
percent
embryo
cryopreservation
or
freezing
is
applied
in
our
program
when
embryos
result
from
residual
gift
eggs
or
from
nontransferred
ivf
embryos
this
procedure
not
only
provides
patients
with
a
subsequent
opportunity
for
success
at
much
reduced
costs
but
also
circumvents
the
legal
and
ethical
issues
relating
to
disposal
of
supernumerary
embryos
therefore
as
stipulated
by
the
american
fertility
society
ethical
guidelines
for
art
programs
from
both
a
practical
and
an
ethical
standpoint
all
assisted
reproduction
programs
should
have
the
capability
of
cryopreserving
human
embrys
gamete
micromanipulation
this
art
procedure
which
is
still
very
new
is
applied
to
couples
who
are
unaccepting
of
insemination
with
donor
semen
but
who
have
severe
male
factor
infertility
less
than
million
spermml
in
combination
with
fewer
than
perccent
motile
sperm
andor
less
than
percent
sperm
with
normal
morphology
we
are
currently
developing
the
procedure
of
subzonal
insertion
szi
which
entails
injecting
sperm
under
the
coating
around
the
egg
the
barrier
normally
penetrated
by
the
sperm
through
enzymatic
digestion
available
data
from
szi
programs
worldwide
indicate
that
only
to
percent
of
szi
cycles
result
in
a
pregnancy
this
statistic
undoubtedly
relates
to
limitations
imposed
by
abnormalities
inherent
in
the
sperm
therefore
we
are
currently
focusing
on
the
development
of
improved
techniques
for
the
recognition
and
selection
of
sperm
chosen
for
manipulation
such
efforts
are
unquestionably
worthwhile
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
technology
offers
the
only
realistic
opportunity
for
severe
male
factor
patients
to
establish
conception

several
reasons
for
the

it
should
be
noted
that
while

leads
in

interdependence
it
is
not
the

illness
doing
so
diseases
such
as

many
respiratory

pathogens
have
similarly
inhibited

impact
that

will
have
on

and
the

that

berkley
also
cites
the
lack
of
political
aggressiveness
toward
the
aids
epidemic
in
its
first
decade
but
now
there
is
a

although
it
is

that
diseases
other
than

such
as
malaria

respiratory

intestinal

have
similarly
inhibited
economic
development
in

and
deserve
much
more
attention
than

berkley
disagrees
with
the
contention
that
aids
is
receiving
too
much
attention
hiv
differs
from
other
diseases
in
most
developing
countries
because
it
is
continuing
to
spread
for
most
endemic
diseases
the
outcome
of
neglecting
interventions
for
one
year
is
another
year
of
about
the
same
level
of
needless
disease
and
death
but
with
aids
and
its
increasing
spread
the
cost
of
neglect
not
only
in
disease
burden
but
financially
is
much
greater
interventions
in
the
early
part
of
a
rampantly
spreading
epidemic
like
hiv
are
highly
costeffective
because
each
individual
infection
prevented
significantly
interrupts
transmission
berkley
says
he
agrees
with
gellert
and
nordenberg
about
the
gigantic
social
and
economic
effects
of
aids
and
about
the
need
for
political
leadership
but
he
concludes
that
not
only
is
assertive
political
leadership
needed
in
the
united
states
for
the
aids
epidemic
but
even
more
so
in

with

news
from
the

there
is
new
evidence
that
the
human
immunodeficiency

can
cause
disease
independently
of
its
ability
to
suppress
the
immune
system
say
scientists
at
the
national
institues

they
report
that
hiv
itself
not
an
opportunistic
infection
caused
scaling
skin
conditions
to
develop
in
mice
carrying
the
genes
for
hiv
although
the
hiv
genes
were
active
in
the
mice
they
did
not
compromise
the
animals
immunity
the
researchers
found
this
led
them
to
conclude
that
the
hiv
itself
caused
the
skin
disease
our
findings
support
a

evidence
that
hiv
can

of

has
been
difficult
since
most
animals

to
bypass
this
problem
scientists
have
developed
hivtransgenic
mice
which
carry
genes
for
hiv
as
well
as
their
own
genetic
material
nidr
scientists
created
the
transgenic
mice
by
injecting
hiv
genes
into
mouse
eggs
and
then
implanting
the
eggs
into
female
mice
the
resulting

in
those
mice
however
became
sick
and
died
too
soon
after
birth
to
study
in
depth
in
the
present
study
the
scientists
used
an
incomplete
copy
of
hiv
which
allowed
the
animals
to
live
longer
some
of
the
transgenic
animals
developed
scaling
wartlike
tumors
on
their
necks
and
backs
other
transgenic
mice
developed
thickened
crusting
skin
lesions
that
covered
most
of
their
bodies
resembling

humans
no
skin
lesions
developed
in
their

studies
of

taken
from

wartlike
skin
tumors
showed
that
they
were
a
type
of
noncancerous

called

the

found
no

however
of
compromised
immunity
in
the

no
increase
in
their

and
no

the
fact
that

were
active
but
the

were
not
suppressed
confirms
that
the

itself
was
causing
the

dr

said
further
proof
of
hiv
gene
involvement
came
from
a
test
in
which
the
scientists
exposed
the

the
light
increased

goal
is
to
get
more
primary
health

providers
involved
in

and
would
like
to
review
the
product
wordscan

is
a
product
of
calera
recognition
systems
it
runs
under

and
supports
that
accufont
technology
of
the

when
initially
bringing
up
the

it

you

file
automatic

of

i
like
manual
decomposition
since
the

then
lets
me
select
which
parts
of
the
document
i
would
like
scanned
and
in
what
order
once
an
image
is
scanned
you
can
bring
up
the
popup
image
verification
the
software
gives
you
two
errors
at
this
point
blue
which
are
words
that
were
converted
reliability
but
do
not
match
anything
in
the
builtin
dictionary
yellow
shade
which
are
words
that
wordscan
plus
doesnt
think
it
converted
correctly
at
all
i
have
found
that
the
software
should
give
itself
more
credit
it
is
usually
correct
instead
of
wrong
if
a
word
is
shaded
blue
you
can
add
it
to
your
personal
dictionary
the
only
problem
is
the
personal
dictionary
will
only
handle
about
words
i
find
this
to
be
very
limited
considering
how
many
medical
terms
are
not
in
a
normal
dictionary
after
a
document
is
converted
you
can
save
it
in
a
multitude
of
word
processor
formats
also
any
images
that
were
captured
can
be
stored
in
a
seperate
tiff
or
pcx
file
format
i
was
extremely
impressed
on
the

the

excellent
overall

the
only
fault
i
could
find
is
the

introduction
despite
predictions
earlier
this
century
that
infectious
diseases
would
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
public
health
problem
infectious
diseases
remain
the
major
cause
of
death
worldwide
and
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
united
states
since
the
early
the
us
public
health
system
has
been
challenged
by
a
myriad
of
newly
identified
pathogens
and
syndromes
eg
escherichia
coli
hepatitis
c
virus
human
immunodeficiency
virus
legionnaires
disease
lyme
disease
and
toxic
shock
syndrome
the
incidences
of
many
diseases
widely
presumed
to
be
under
control
such
as
cholera
malaria
and
tuberculosis
tb
have
increased
in
many
areas
furthermore
control
and
prevention
of
infectious
diseases
are
undermined
by
drug
resistance
in
conditions
such
as
gonorrhea
malaria
pneumococcal
disease
salmonellosis
shigellosis
tb
and
staphylococcal
infections
emerging
infections
place
a
disproportionate
burden
on
immunocompromised
persons
those
in
institutional
settings
eg
hospitals
and
child
day
care
centers
and
minority
and
underserved
populations
the
substantial
economic
burden
of
emerging
infections
on
the
us
healthcare
system
could
be
reduced
by
more
effective
surveillance
systems
and
targeted
control
and
prevention
programs
this
issue
of
mmwr
introduces
a
new
series
emerging
infectious
diseases
future
articles
will
address
these
diseases
as

as

also
have

preliminary
data
from

revealed
that
when

were
routinely
cultured
for

that
organism
was
isolated
more
frequently
than
shigella
in
four
of
participating
hospitals
and
was
isolated
from

a
higher
rate
than
for

as
a
component

to

entering

supply
because
slaughtering
practices
can
result
in
contamination

because
the

may
transfer

undercooking

the

underscore
the

low

linked

american
lung
association
a
new
study
published
by
the
american
lung
association
has
shown
that
surprisingly
low
concentrations
of
airborne
particles
can
send
people
with
asthma
rushing
to
emergency
rooms
for
treatment
the
seattlebased
study
showed
that
roughly
one
in
eight
emergency
visits
for
asthma
in
that
city
was
linked
to
exposure
to
particulate
air
pollution
the
actual
exposure
levels
recorded
in
the
study
were
far
below
those
deemed
unsafe
under
federal
air
quality
laws
people
with
asthma
have
inflamed
airways
and
airborne
particles
tend
to
exacerbate
that
inflammation
said
joel
schwartz

of
the
environmental

agency
who
was
the
lead
author
of
the
study
when
people
are
on
the
threshold
of
having
a
serious
asthma
attack
particles
can
push
them
over
the
edge
the
seattle
study
correlated
months
of
asthma
emergency
room
visits
with
daily
levels
of
pm
or
particulate
matter
with
an
aerodynamic
diameter
of
microns
or
less
these
finer
particles
are
considered
hazardous
because
they
are
small
enough
penetrate
into
the
lung
cities

considered
out
of
compliance
with

air
laws
if
the
average
concentration
of

micrograms
per
cubic
millimeter
of
air
in
seattle
however
a
link
between
fine
particles
and
asthma
was
found
at
levels
as
low
as
micrograms
the
authors
concluded
that
for
every
microgram
increase
in
the
fourday
average
of
the
odds
of
someone
with
asthma
needing
emergency
treatment
increased
by
percent
the
findings
were

in
the
april
american
review
of
respiratory
disease
an
official
journal
of
the
american
thoracic
society
the
lung

medical
section
the
study
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
recent
reports
to
suggest
that
particulate
matter
is
a
greatly
under
appreciated
health
threat
a
study
by
dr
schwartz
and
douglas
dockery
phd
of
harvard
found
that
particles
may
be
causing
roughly
premature
deaths
each
year
in
the
united
states
other
studies
have
linked
particulate
matter
to
increased
respiratory
symptoms
and
bronchitis
in
children
government
officials
and
the
media
are
still
very
focused
on
ozone
says
dr
schwartz
but
more
and
more
research
is
showing
that
particles
are
bad
actors
as
well
one
problem
in
setting
standards
for
particulate
air
pollution
is
that
pmio
is
difficult
to
study
unlike
other
regulated
pollutants
such
as

and

says
dr
schwartz
we
have
no
way
of
duplicating
the
typical
urban
mix
of

consequently
most
of
what
is
known
about
particulates
has
been
learned
through

research
like
the
seattle
study
given
that
the
epas
current
priority
is
to

the
ozone

standards
the
agency
is
unlikely
to

the
standard
any
time
soon
until

are

there

little
people
with

do
to

themselves
from
airborne

in

areas
you

the

ncidesignated
cancer
centers
the
cancer
centers
program
is
comprised
of
ncidesignated
cancer
centers
actively
engaged
in
multidisciplinary
research
efforts
to
reduce
cancer
incidence
morbidity
and
mortality
within
the
program
there
are
four
types
of
cancer
centers
basic
science
cancer
centers
which
engage
primarily
in
basic
cancer
research
clinical
cancer
centers
which
focus
on
clinical
research
comprehensive
cancer
centers
which
emphasize
a
multidisciplinary
approach
to
cancer
research
patient
care
and
community
outreach
and
consortium
cancer
centers
which
specialize
in
cancer
prevention
and
control
research
although
some
cancer
centers
existed
in
the
late
and
the
it
was
the
national
cancer
act
of
that
authorized
the
establishment
of
new
cancer
centers
as
well
as
continuing
support
for
existing
ones
the
passage
of
the
act
also
dramatically
transformed
the
centers
structure
and
broadened
the
scope
of
their
mission
to
include
all
aspects
of
basic
clinical
and
cancer
control
research
over
the
next
two
decades
the
centers
program
grew
progressively
in
there
were
comprehensive
cancer
centers
in
the
nation
today
there
are
of
these
institutions
all
of
which
meet
specific
nci
criteria
for
comprehensive
status
to
attain
recognition
from
the
nci
as
a
comprehensive
cancer
center
an
institution
must
pass
rigorous
peer
review
under
guidelines
newly
established
in
the
eight
criteria
for
comprehensiveness
include
the
requirement
that
a
center
have
a
strong
core
of
basic
laboratory
research
in
several
scientific
fields
such
as
biology
and
molecular
genetics
a
strong
program
of
clinical
research
and
an
ability
to
transfer
research
findings
into
clinical
practice
moreover
five
of
the
criteria
for
comprehensive
status
go
significantly
beyond
that
required
for
attaining
a
cancer
center
support
grant
also
referred
to
as
a
or
core
grant
the
mechanism
of
choice
for
supporting
the
infrastructure
of
a
cancer
centers
operations
these
criteria
encompass
strong
participation
in
ncidesignated
highpriority
clinical
trials
significant
levels
of
cancer
prevention
and
control
research
and
important
outreach
and
educational
activitiesall
of
which
are
funded
by
a
variety
of
sources
the
other
types
of
cancer
centers
also
have
special
characteristics
and
capabilities
for
organizing
new
programs
of
research
that
can
exploit
important
new
findings
or
address
timely
research

these

entirely
in

although
some

engage
in
collaborative

with
outside
clinical

investigators
and
in
cooperative
projects
with

focus
on
both
basic

the

who
had
hoped
to
test
a
vaccine
made
by

inc
and
the
national

contended
that
multiple

should
be

secretary

said
a
final
announcement
on
the
therapeutic
vaccine
trials
was
expected
to
be
made
last
friday
companies

genentech
inc
chiron
corp

immuno

have
already
told

that
they
are
prepared

the
testing
is
intended
to
demonstrate
whether
aids
vaccines
are
effective
in
thwarting
the
replication
of
hiv
in
patients
already
infected
shalala
refuted
last
weeks
reports
that
the
clinton
administration
had
decided
the
armys
test
of
the
microgenesys
vaxsyn
should
proceed
without
tests
of
others
at
the
same
time
the
report
was
inaccurate
and
i
expect
there
to
be
some
announcement
in
the
next
hours
about
that
particular
aids
research
project
said
shalala
administration
sources
subsequently
confirmed
that

and
food

administration
commissioner
david
kessler
had
convinced
the
white
house
that
multiple

should
be
tested
simultaneously
but
microgenesys
president
frank
volvovitz
said
a
test
of
multiple
vaccines
could
triple
the
cost
of
the
trial

delay
it

absurd

from

perspective
any

at

there
is
a

on

who
claims
that
he
was
cured
of
cfs
by
taking
accutane
he
also
claims
that
you
are
using
it
in
the
treatment
of
fibromyalgia
syndrome
are
you
using
accutane
in
the
treatment
of
fibromyalgia
syndrome
yes
have
you
used
it
for
cfs
it
seems
to
work
equally
well
for
cfs
another
hint
that
these
may
be
different
facets
of
the
same
underlying
process
have
you
gotten
good
results
with
it
yes
the
benefit
is
usually
evident
within
a
few
days
of
starting
it
most
of
the
patients
for
whom
it
has
worked
well
continued
lowdose
amitriptyline
daily
aerobic
excersise
and
a
regular
sleep
schedule
current
standard
therapy
because
of
the
cost
usually
depending

and
potential
for
significant
side
effects
like
corneal
injury
and
birth
defects
i
currently
reserve
it
for
those
who
fail

treatment
it
is
important
that
the
person
prescribing
it
have

with

medicine

the
acquisition

is
completely

the

of
that

in

the

read
a

on

sometime
if
you
want
to
see
a

of
them
after
scientific
methods
have
run
out
then
its
the

freedom
of
choice
to
try
any
experimental
method
they
choose
and
its
well
recognized
by
many
doctors
that
medicine
doesnt
have
all
the
answers
certainly
we
dont
have
all
the

the
question
is
what
is
the
most
reliable
means
of
acquiring
further
medical
knowledge
the
scientific
method
has
proven
itself
to
be
reliable
the
only
reason
alternative
therapies
are
shunned
by
physicians
is
that
their
practitioners
refuse
to
submit
their
theories
to
rigorous
scientific
scrutiny
insisting
that
tradition
or
anecdotal
evidence
are
sufficient
these
have
been
shown
many
times
in
the
past
to
be
very
unreliable
ways
of
acquiring
reliable
knowledge
crooks
ideas
have
never

that
his

the
favorable

what

he
paints
himself
as

battling
an
intolerant

but
i
have
no

from
which
to

his

two

however
i
read
that
the

has
decided
to
focus
their
attention
on
burzynskis
work
their
budget
is
so
small
that
i
imagine
they
wouldnt

any

extensive

the

undertake
his

for
brain
glioblastoma
this
disease
is
universally
and
usually
rapidly
fatal
after

in

the
tumor
was
growing
rapidly
despite
radiation
and
chemotherapy
the

checked
extensively
on
dr
burzynkis
track
record
for
this
disease
he
spoke
to
a
few
patients
in
complete
remission
for
a
few
years
from
glioblastoma
following
this
treatment
and
to
an

had
audited
other
such
case
histories

found
them
valid
and
impressive
after
the

began
dr
burzynskis
treatment
in

performed

since
the

stopped
its

shes

living
things
maintain
small
electric
fields
to
enhance
certain
chemical
reactions
promote
communication
of
states
with
in
a
cell
communicate
between
cells
of
which
the
nervous
system
is
a
specialized
example
and
perhaps
other
uses
these
electric
fields
change
with
location
and
time
in
a
large
organism
special
photographic
techniques
such
as
applying
external
fields
in
kirillian
photography
interact
with
these
fields
or
the
resistances
caused
by
these
fields
to
make
interesting
pictures
perhaps
such
pictures
will
be
diagonistic
of
disease
problems
in
organisms
when
better
understood
perhaps
not
studying
the
overall
electric
activity
of
biological
systems
is
several
hundred
years
old
but
not
a
popular
activity
perhaps
except
in
the
case
of
a
few
tissues
like
nerves
and
the
electric
senses
of
fishes
it
is
hard
to
reduce
the
investigation
into
small
pieces
that
can
be
clearly
analyzed
there
are
some
hints
that
manipulating
electric
fields
is
a
useful
therapy
such
as
speeding
the
healing
of
broken
bones
but
not
understood
why
bioelectricity
has
a
long
association
with
mysticism
ideas
such
as
frankenstein
reanimation
go
back
to
the
most
early
electrical
experiments
on
tissue
such
as
when
volta
invented
the
battery
i
personally
dont
care
to
revert

sore
spot
on
testicles
my
husband
woke
up
three
days
ago
with
a
small
sore
spot
a
spot
about
the
size
of
a
nickel
on
one
of
his
testicles
bottom
side
no
knots
or
lumps
just
a
little
sore
spot
he
says
it
reminds
him
of
how
a
bruise
feels
he
has
no
recollection
of
hitting
it
or
anything
like
that
that
would
cause
a
bruise
he
asssures
me
hed
remember
something
like
that
any
clues
as
to
what
it
might
be
hes
somewhat

hes

my
dentist
who
sees
a
fair
amount
of
thrush
recommended
acidophilous
after
i
began
taking
acidophilous
on
a
daily
basis
the
outbreaks
ceased
when
i
quit
taking
the
acidophilous
the
outbreaks
periodically
resumed
i
resumed
taking
the
acidophilous
with
no
further
outbreaks
since
then
this
is
the
second
post
which
seems
to
be
blurring
the
distinction
between
real
disease
caused
by
candida
albicans
and
the
disease
that
was
being
asked
about
systemic
yeast
syndrome
there
is
no
question
that
candida
albicans
causes
thrush
it
also
seems
to
be
the
case
that
active
yogurt
cultures
with
acidophilous
may
reduce
recurrences
of
thrush
at
least
for
vaginal
thrush
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
taking
it
for
oral
thrush
before
though
presumably
it
would
work
by
the
same
mechanism
candida
is
clearly
a
common
minor
pathogen
and
a
less
common
major
pathogen
that
does
not
mean
that
there
is
evidence
that
it
causes
the
systemic
yeast
syndrome

opinions
on
allergy
hay
fever
shots
hello
i
am
interested
in
trying
this
desensitization
method
against
hay
fever
what
is
the
state
of
affairs
about
this
i
went
to
a
doctor
and
paid
for
a
minute
interview
scratches
leading
to
the
diagnostic
that
i
am
allergic
to
june
and
timothy
grass
i
believe
this
from
now
on
it
looks
like
shots
per
week
for
months
followed
by
shot
per
month
or
so
each
shot
costs
talking
about
soaring
costs
and
the
health
care
system
i
would
call
that
a
racket
we
are
not
talking
about
rare
amazonian
grasses
here
but
the
garbage
which
grows
behind
the
doctors
office
apart
from
this
issue
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
to
find
out
that
you
have
to
keep
getting
the
shots
forever
is
that
right
thanks
for

re
discussions
on
altpsychoactives
in
article
billccolhpcom
bill
claussen
writes
this
group
was
originally
a
takeoff
from
scimed
the
reason
for
the
formation
of
this
group
was
to
discuss
prescription
psychoactive
drugssuch
as
oh
well
obviously
no
one
really
cares
then
let
me
ask
you
for
a
workable
solution
we
have
a
name
here
that
implies
certain
things
to
many
people
rather
than
trying
to
educate
each
and
every
person
that
comes
to
the
group
is
there
some
name
that
would
imply
what
this
group
was
originally
intended
for
my
dad
was
a
lawyer
as
such
i
grew
up
with
being
a
stickler
for
meaning
in
my
reality
psychoactives
technically
could
range
from
caffeine
to
datura
to
the
drugs
you
mention
to
more
standard
recreational
drugs
in
practice
i
had
hoped
to
see
it
limited
to
those
that
were
above
some
psychoactive
level
like
some
of
the
drugs
you
mention
but
also
possibly
including
some
recreational
drugs
but
with
conversation
limited
to
their
psychoactive
effects
the
recent
query
about
bong
water
i
thought
was
a
bit
off
topic
so
i
just
hit
k
but
back
to
the
original
question
what
is
a
workable
solution
what
is
a
workable
name
that
would
imply
the
topic
you
with
to
discuss
it
sounds
like
there
should
be
a
altsmartdrugs
or
something
similar
i
dont
feel
psychoactives
would
generally
be
used
to
describe
alot
of
those
drugs
there
is
a
big
difference
between
a
drug
that
if
taken
in
certain
doses
over
a
period
of
days
may
have
a
psychoactive
effect
in
some
people
vs
many
of
the
drugs
in
pihkah
which
are
psychoactive
wm
if
prochoice
means
choice
after
conception
does
this
apply
to
men
too

about
getting

from
acupuncture
needles
unless
your
friend
is

with
their

who
themselves

is
unlikely
not
impossible
they
will
get
aids
from
acupuncture
needles
generally
even
if
accidently
inoculated
the
normal
immune
response
should
be
enough
to
effectively
handle
the
minimal
contaminant
involved
with
acupuncture
needle
insertion
isnt
this
what
hiv
is
about
the
normal
immune
response
to
an
exposure
most
acupuncturists
use
disposable
needlesuse
once
and
throw
away
i
had
electrical
pulse
nerve
testing
done
a
while
back
the
needles
were
taken
from
a
dirty
drawer
in
an
instrument
cart
and
were
most
certainly
not
sterile
or
even
clean
for
that
matter
more
than
likely
they
were
fresh
from
the
previous

i
was
concerned

i
kept

some
weird

allergies
nuts
mushrooms
many
of
these

are
cornbased
after
your
post
i
looked
in
the
literature
and
located
two
articles
that
implicated
corn
contains
tryptophan
and
seizures
the
idea
is
that
corn
in
the
diet
might
potentiate
an
already
existing
or
latent
seizure
disorder
not
cause
it
check
to

is
corn
she
has

eating

corn
on

that

usually
later

have
to

im

that

in

the
point
is
that
dr

has
developed
a
feel
for
what
is

what
isnt

this
comes
from
years
of

no

can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr

a

and
accuse
him
of
trying

make
a

why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a

the
quacks
dont

they
poopoo

this
is

believe
me
ive
seen
it
many

the

arent

well
treat
it

also
is
dr

practice
almost

devoted

i
dont

any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
no
he
does
not
exclusively
treat

patients
however
in
some
parts
of
the
country
you
dont
need
to
be
known
as
an
ld
specialist
to
see
a
large
number
of
ld
patients
walk
through
your
office
given
the
huge
problem
of
underdiagnosis
orthopedists
encounter
late
manifestations
of
the
disease
just
about
every
day
in
their
regular
practices
dr
n
told
me
that
last
year
he
sent
between
and
patients
a
week
to
the
ld
specialists
and
he
is
not
the
only
orthopedists
in
the
town
lets
say
that
only
people
per
week
actually
have
ld
that
means
at
the
very
minimum
people
in
our
town
and
immediate
area
develop
late
stage
manifestations
of
ld
every
year
add
in
the
folks
who
were
diagnosed
by
neurologists
rheumatologists
gps
etc
and
you
can
see
what
kind
of
problem
we
have
no
wonder
just
about
everybody
in
town
personally
knows
an
ld
patient
he
refers
most
patients
to
ld
specialists
but
in
extreme
cases
he
puts
the
patient
on
medication
immediately
to
minimize
the
damage
in
most
cases
to
the

gordon
is

prof
mick
noordewier
rutgers
university
this
overview
of
the
essential
facts
of
molecular
biology
is
intended
as
an
introduction
to
the
field
for
computer
scientists
who
wish
to
apply
their
tools
to
this
rich
and
complex
domain
material
covered
will
include
structural
and
informational
molecules
the
basic
organization
of
the
cell
and
of
genetic
material
the
central
dogma
of
gene
expression
and
selected
other
topics
in
the
area
of
structure
function
and
regulation
as
relates
to
current
computational
approaches
dr
noordewier
has
appointments
in
both
computer
science
and
biology
at
rutgers
and
has
extensive
experience
in
basic
biological
research
in

to
his
current
work

an
overview
of
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
will
be
presented
as
it
relates
to
actual
and
potential
biological
applications
fundamental
techniques
symbolic
programming
languages
and
notions
of
search
will
be
discussed
as
well
as
selected
topics
in
somewhat
greater
detail
such
as
knowledge
representation
inference
and
machine
learning
the
intended
audience
includes
biologists
with
some
computational
background
but
no
extensive
exposure
to
artificial
intelligence
dr
lathrop
codeveloper
of
ariadne
and
related
technologies
has
worked
in
the
area
of
artificial
intelligence
applied
to
biological
problems
in
both
academia
and
industry
neural
networks
statistics
and
information
theory
in
biological
sequence
analysis
dr
alan
lapedes
los
alamos
national
laboratory
this
tutorial
will
cover
the
most
rapidlyexpanding
facet
of
intelligent
systems
for
molecular
biology
that
of
machine
learning
techniques
applied
to
sequence
analysis
closely
interrelated
topics
to
be
addressed
include
the
use
of
artifical
neural
networks
to
elicit
both
specific
signals
and
general
characteristics
of
sequences
and
the
relationship
of
such
approaches
to
statistical
techniques
and
informationtheoretic
views
of
sequence
data
dr
lapedes
of
the
theoretical
division
at
los
alamos
has
long
been
a
leader
in
the
use
of
such
techniques
in
this
domain
genetic
algorithms
and
genetic
programming
prof
john
koza
stanford
university
the
genetic
algorithm
an
increasingly
popular
approach
to
highly
nonlinear
multidimensional
optimization
problems
was
originally
inspired
by
a
biological
metaphor
this
tutorial
will
cover
both
the
biological
motivations
and
the
actual
implementation
and
characteristics
of
the
algorithm
genetic
programming
an
extension
wellsuited
to
problems
where
the
discovery
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
solution
is
a
major
part
of
the
problem
will
also
be
addressed
particular
attention
will
be
paid
to
biological
applications
and
to
identifying
resources
and
software
that
will
permit
attendees
to
begin
using
the
methods
dr
koza
a
consulting
professor
of
computer
science
at
stanford
has
taught
this
subject
since
and
is
the
author
of
a
standard
text
in
the
field
linguistic

prof
david
searls
university
of
pennsylvania
shmuel
pietrokovski
weizmann
institute
approaches
to
sequence
analysis
based
on
linguistic
methodologies
are
increasingly
in
evidence
these
involve
the
adaptation
of
tools
and
techniques
from
computational
linguistics
for
syntactic
pattern
recognition
and
gene
prediction
the
classification
of
genetic
structures
and
phenomena
using
formal
language
theory
the
identification
of
significant
vocabularies
and
overlapping
codes
in
sequence
data
and
sequence
comparison
reflecting
taxonomic
and
functional
relatedness
dr
searls
who
holds
research
faculty
appointments
in
both
genetics
and
computer
science
at
penn
represents
the
branch
of
this
field
that
considers

theres
no

way
to
get
aids
from
the

in
the
latter
case
its
highly
unlikely
though
many
practitioners
use
the

variety
anyway
it
is
illegal
to
perform

with

no

minor

of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as

she
wants
to
avoid

are
there
any

the

for

chances
are
good
that
if

for

in

segment
entitled
no

for

show
host
ed
bradley
makes
alarming
statements
without
adequately
substantiating
them
millions
are
suffering
a
host
of
symptoms
and
some
get
violently
sick
peppers
his
report
with
sensational
but
clinically
unproven
personal
testimony
and
speaks
of
studies
on
msg
that
make
the
substance
seem
harmful
without
explaining
just
how
inconclusive
those
studies
are
consider
his
making
reference
at
the
beginning
of
the
program
to
a
study
conducted
at
the
eastern
virginia
medical
school
in
order
to
back
up
his
comment
that
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
msg
a
flavor
enhancer
in
chinese
and
other
asian
cuisines
as
well
as
in
many
supermarket
items
causes
headaches
what
he
does
not
make
reference
to
is
the
fact
that
the
study
was
performed
not
on
humans
but
on
rabbits
one
of
the
researchers
who
conducted
the
study
pharmacologist
patricia
williams
phd
says
it
certainly
is
conceivable
that
a
small
minority
of
people
are
sensitive
enough
to
msg
to
get
headaches
from
it
but
she
explains
the
show
probably
overemphasized
the
extent
of
the
problem
a
second
lapse
comes
with
mention
of
dr
john
olney
a
professor
at
the
washington
university
school
of
medicine
who
mr
bradley
remarks
says
that
his
years
of
research
with
laboratory
animals
shows
msg
is
a
hazard
for
developing
youngsters
because
it
poses
a
threat
of
irreversible
brain
damage
dr
olneys
research
with
lab
animals
does
not
show
anything
about
human
youngsters
in
fact
only
under
extreme
circumsrtances
did
dr
olneys
experiments
ever
bring
about
any
brain
damage
when
he
injected
extremely
high
doses
of
msg
into
rodents
completely
bypassing
their
digestive
tracts
and
entering
their
bloodstreams
more
directly
and
when
he
used
tubes
to
forcefeed
huge
amounts
of
the
substance
to
very
young
animals
on
an
empty
stomach
of
course
neither
of
those
procedures
occurs
with
humans
they
simply
take
in
msg
with

the

failsafe
of

the

has
consistently
exonerated
the

thats
quite
fortunate
since
the
alleged
hazardous
component
of
monosodium
glutamate
glutamate
enters
our
systems
whenever
we
eat
any
food
that
contains
protein
the
reason
is
that
one
of
the
amino
acids
that
make
up
protein
glutamic
acid
is
broken
down
into
glutamate
during
digestion
its
a
breakdown
that
occurs
frequently
glutamic
acid
is
the
most
abundant
of
the
or
so
amino
acids
in
the
diet
it
makes
up
about
percent
of
the
protein
in
flesh
foods
percent
in
milk
percent
in
corn
and
percent
in
whole
wheat
that
doesnt

its

properly

clinic
at

the

was
open
till
pm
the

went
to
the

and
told
the

that
we
were
there
and
came

and
told

the

would
not

she
had

did

to
be

during

in

with

to

the

told

the

was

in

the

would
not

look
at

the

the

her

when
asked
who
is

of
the

she
said
i
dont
know
i
realize
that
a
private
clinic
is
not
the

as
an
emergency
room
but
i
was
quite
angry
at
being
turned
away
because
the
doctor
did
not

to
be
bothered
my
son
did
get
three
stitches
at
the
emergency

speaking
as
a
physician
who
works
in
an
urgent

center
the
above
behavior
is
completely
inappropriate
if
a
patient
who
requires
extensive
care
shows
up
at
the
last
minute
we
always
see
them
and
give
them
appropriate
care
it
is
reasonable
for
a
clinic
to
refuse
to
see
patients
outside
of
its
posted
hours
but
what
you
describe
is
misbehavior
ask
to
speak

if

with

the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruction
of
the
intestine
without
knowing
more
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
obstruction
is
permanent
due

scarring

temporary
due
to
swelling
of
inflammed
intestine
in
general
there
are
no
dietary
limitations
in
patients
with
crohns
except
as
they
relate
to
obstruction
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
foods
will
bring
on
recurrence
of
crohns
it
is
important
to
distinguish
recurrence
from
recurrent
symptoms
a
physician
would
think
of
new
inflammation
as
recurrence
while
pains
from
raw
veggies
just
imply
a
narrowing
of
the
intestine
your

should
look

no

how

with

how

can

these
are

them

elaine

then
when

start

it

i
couldnt

elaine

jon
but
somebody
else
did
could
they
know
more
than

no
way
they
must
be
a
quack
ive
been
teaching
a
human
nutrition
course
for
medical
students
for
over
ten
years
now
and
guess
who
the
most
receptive
students
are
those
that
were
raised
on
farms
and
saw
firsthand
the
effect
of
diet
on
the
health
of
their
farm
animals
and
those
students
who
had
made
a
dramatic
diet
change
prior
to
entering
medical
schoolswitched
to
the
vegan
diet
typically
this
is
about
of
my
class
of
students
those
not
interested
in
nutrition
either
tune
me
out
or
just
stop
coming
to
class
thats
okay
because
i
know
that
some
of
what
im
teaching
is
going
to
stick
and
there
will
be
at
least
a
few
enlightened
physicians
practicing
in
the
us
its
really
too
bad
that
most
us
medical
schools
dont
cover
nutrition
because
if
they
did
candida
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
in
animal
husbandry
an
animal
is
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotics
are
stopped
medicine
has
decided
that
since
humans
do
not
have
a
ruminant
stomach
no
such
reinnoculation
with
good
bacteria
is
needed
after
coming
off
a
braod
spectrum
antibiotic
humans
have
all
kinds
of
different
organisms
living
in
the
gi
systemmouth
stomach
small
and
large
intestine
sinuses
vagina
and
on
the
skin
these
are
nonpathogenic
because
they
do
not
cause
disease
in
people
unless
the
immune
system
is
compromised
they
are
also
called
nonpathogens
because
unlike
the
pathogenic
organisms
that
cause
human
disease
they
do
not
produce
toxins
as
they
live
out
their
merry
existence
in
and
on
our
body
but
any
of
these
organisms
will
be
considered
pathogenic
if
it
manages
to
take
up
residence
within
the
body
a
poor
mucus
membrane
barrier
can
let
this
happen
and
vitamin
a
is
mainly
responsible
for
setting
up
this
barrier
steve
got
real
upset
with
elaines

he
was

antifungals
and
vitamin

gi

if
steve
really
understoood
what

he
would
notor
at

here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
an
infection
caused
by
this
organism
is
called
candidiasis
candidiasis
is
a
very
rare
occurance
because
like
an
e
coli
infection
it
requires
that
the
host
immune
system
be
severly
depressed
candida
is
frequently
found
on
the
skin
and
all
of
the
mucous
membranes
of
normal
healthy
people
and
it
rarely
becomes
a
problem
unless
some
predisposing
factor
is
present
such
as
a
high
blood
glucose
leveldiabetes
or
an
oral
course
of
antibiotics
has
been
used
in
diabetics
their
secretions
contain
much
higher
amounts
of
glucose
candida
unlike
bacteria
is
very
limited
in
its
foodfuel
selection
without
glucose
it
can
not
grow
it
just
barely
survives
if
it
gets
access
to
a
lot
of
glucose
it
blooms
and
over
rides
the
other
organisms
living
with
it
in
the
sinuses
gi
tract
or
vagina
in
diabetics
skin
lesions
can
also
foster
a
good
bloom
site
for
these
little
buggers
the
bloom
is
usually
just
a
minor
irritant
in
most
people
but
some
people
do
really
develop
a
bad
inflammatory
process
at
the
mucus
membrane
or
skin
bloom
site
whether
this
is
an
allergic
like
reaction
to
the
candida
or
not
isnt
certain
when
the
bloom
is
in
the
vagina
or
on
the
skin
it
can
be
easliy
seen
and
some
doctors
do
then
try
to
treat
it
if
its
internal
only
symptoms
can
be
used
and
these
symptoms
are
pretty
nondiscript
candida
is
kept
in
check
in
most
people
by
the
normal
bacterial
flora
in
the
sinuses
the
gi
tractmouth
stomach
and
intestines
and
in
the
vaginal
tract
which
compete
with
it
for
food
the
human
immune
system
ususally
does
not
bother
itself
with
thesenonpathogenic
organisms
unless
they
broach
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
if
they
do
an
inflammatory
response
will
be
set
up
most
americans
are
not
getting
enough
vitamin
a
from
their
diets
about
of
all
americans
die
with
less
vitamin
a
than
they
were
born
withus
autopsy
studies
while
this
low
level
of
vitamin
a
does
not
cause
pathologyblindness
it
does
impair
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
this
would
then
be
a
predisposing
factor
for
a
strong
inflammatory
response
after
a
candida
bloom
while
diabetics
can
suffer
from
a
candida
bloom
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
bloom
is
the
use
of
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
which
knock
down
many
different
kinds
of
bacteria
in
the
body
and
remove
the
main
competition
for
candida
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
while
drugs
are
available
to
handle
candida
many
patients
find
that
their
doctor
will
not
use
them
unless
there
is
evidence
of
a
systemic
infection
the
toxicity
of
the
antifungal
drugs
does
warrant
some
caution
but
if
the
gi
or
sinus
inflammation
is
suspected
to
be
candidaand
recent
use
of
a
broad
spectrum
antibiotic
is
the
smoking
gun
then
antifungal
use
should
be
approrpriate
just
as
the
antifungal
creams
are
an
appropriate
treatment
for
recurring
vaginal
yeast
infections
in
spite
of
what
mr
steve
dyer
says
but
even
in
patients
being
given
the
antifungals
the
irritation
caused
by
the
excessive
candida
bloom
in
the
sinus
gi
tract
or
the
vagina
tends
to
return
after
drug
treatment
is
discontinued

most

therapy

it

organism
and

not

in

acidophilius

bacteriaunless
you
are
hit
with
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
in
the
gi
system
the
anorectal
region
seems
to
be
a
particularly
good
reservoir
for
candida
and
the
use
of
pantyhose
by
many
women
creates
a
very
favorable
environment
around
the
rectum
for
transferthrough
moisture
and
humidity
of
candida
to

vaginal
tract
one
of
the
most
effctive
ways
to
minimmize
this
transfer
is
to
wear
undyed
cotton
underwear
if
the
bloom
occurs
in
the
anal

the
burning
swelling

even

what
then
is
causing
my
distress
when
i
finally
find
a
doctor
who
treats
me
and
gets
me
better
steve

a

candida
prefers
a
slightly
alkaline
environment
while
bacteria
tend
to
prefer
a
slightly
acidic
environment
the
vagina
becomes
alkaline
during
a
womans
period
and
this
is
often
when
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
vinegar
and
water
douches
are
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
vaginal
problems
many
women
have
also
gotten
relief
from
the
introduction
of
lactobacillus
directly
into
the
vaginal
tracti
would
want
to
be
sure
of
the
purity
of
the
product
before
trying
this
my
wife
had
this
vagina
problem
after
going
on
birth
control
pills
and
searched
for
over
a
year
until
she
found
a
gynocologist
who
solved
the
problem
rather
than
just
writting
scripts
for
antifungal
creams
this
was
a
woman
gynocologist
who
had
had
the
same
problemrecurring
vaginal
yeast
infections
this
md
did
some
digging
and
came
up
with
an
acetic
acid
and
l
acidophilis
douche
which
she
used
in
your
office
to
keep
it
sterile
after
three
treatments
sex
returned
to
our
marraige
i
have
often
wondered
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinus
problems
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tells
his
patients
is
a
nonexistent
syndrome
the
nonpathogenic
bacteria
l
acidophilus
is
an
acid
producing
bacteria
which
is
the
most
common
bacteria
found
in
the
vaginal
tract
of
healthy
women
if
taken
orally
it
can
also
become
a
major
bacteria
in
the
gut
through
aresol
sprays
it
has
also
been
used
to
innoculate
the
sinus
membranes
but
before
this
innoculation
occurs
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
needs
to
be
strengthened
this
is
accomplished
by
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
and
some
of
the
bcomplex
vitamins
diet
surveys
repeatedly
show
that
americans
are
not
getting
enough
and
folate
these
are
probably
the
segement
of
the
population
that
will
have
the
greatest
problem
with
this
nonexistent
disordercandida
blooms
after
antibiotic
therapy
some
of
the
above
material
was
obtained
from
natural
healing
by
mark
bricklin
published
by
rodale
press
as
well
as
notes
from
my
human
nutrition
course
i
will
be
posting
a
discussion
of
vitamin
a
sometime
in
the
future
along
with
reference
citings
to
point
out
the
extremely
important
role
that
vitamin
a
plays
in
the
mucus
membrane
defense
system
in
the
body
and
why
vitamin
a
should
be
effective
in
dealing
with
candida
blooms
another
effective
dietary
treatment
is
to
restrict
carbohydrate
intake
during
the
treatment
phase
this
is
especially
important
if
the
gi
system
is
involved
if
candida
can
not
get
glucose
its
not
going
to
out
grow
the
bacteria
and
you
then
give
bacteria
which
can
use
amino
acids
and
fatty
acids
for
energy
a
chance
to
take
over
and
keep
the
candida
in
check
once
carbohydrate
is
returned
to
the
gut
if
steve
and
some
of
the
other
naysayers
want
to
jump
all
over
this
post
fine
i
jumped
all
over
steve

he
verbably
accosted
a

who
was
seeking
advice
about
her
doctors
use
of
vitamin
a
and
antifungals
for
a
candida
bloom
in
her

people
seeking

not
be
treated
this
way

any

thank
you
dave
carvell
first
let
me
offer
you
my
condolences
ive
had
kidney
stones
times
and
i
know
the
pain
she
is
going
through
first
it
is
best
that
she
see
a
doctor
however
every
time
i
had
kidney
stones
i
saw
my
doctor
and
the
only
thing
they
did
was
to
prescribe
some
pain
killers
and
medication
for
a
urinary
tract
infection
the
pain
killers
did
nothing
for
mekidney
stones
are
extremely
painful
my
stones
were
judged
passable
so
we
just
waited
it
out
however
the
last
one
took
days
to
passnot
fun
anyway
if
she
absolutely
wont
see
a
doctor
i
suggest
drinking
lots
of
fluids
and
perhaps
an
over

counter
sleeping
pill
but
i
do
highly
suggest
seeing
a
doctor
kidney
stones
are
not
something
to
fool
around
with
she

there
is

a
friend
has
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
minor
case
of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as
fresh
vegetables
without
discomfort
and
of
course
she
wants
to
avoid
a
recurrence
her
question
is
are
there
any
nutritionists
who
specialize
in
the
problems
of
people
with
crohns
disease
if
she
is
having
problems
with
fresh
vegetables
the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruction
of
the
intestine
without
knowing
more
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
obstruction
is
permanent
due
to
scarring
or
temporary
due
to
swelling
of
inflammed
intestine
in
general
there
are
no
dietary
limitations
in
patients
with
crohns
except
as
they
relate
to
obstruction
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
foods
will
bring
on
recurrence
of
crohns
interesting
statements
simply
because
i
have
been
told
otherwise
im
certainly
not
questioning
steves
claims
as
for
one
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
i
agree
that
foods
dont
bring
on
the
recurrence
of
crohns
but
inflammation
can
be
either
mildly
or
drastically
enhanced
due
to
food
having
had
one
major
obstruction
resulting
in
resection
is
that
a
good
enough
caveat
i
was
told
that
a
low
residue
diet
is
called
for
basically
the
idea
is
that
if
there
is
inflammation
of
the
gut
which
may
not
be
realized
by
the
patient
any
residue
in
the
system
can
be
caught
in
the
folds
of
inflammation
and
constantly
irritate
thus
exacerbating
the
problem
therefore
anything
that
doesnt
digest
completely
by
the
point
of
common
inflammation
should
be
avoided
with
what
ive
been
told
is
typical
crohns
of
the
terminal
ileum
my
diet
should
be
low
residue
consisting
of
completely
out
never
again
items
o
corn
kernel
husk
doesnt
digest
most
of
us
know
this
o
popcorn
same
o
dried
dehydrated
fruit
and
fruit
skins
o
nuts
very
tough
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
some
fudge
discouraged
greatly
o
raw
vegetables
too
fibrous
o
wheat
and
raw
grain
breads
o
exotic
lettuce
iceberg
is
ok
since
its
apparently
mostly
water
o
greens
turnip
mustard
kale
etc
o
little
seeds
like
sesame
try
getting
an
arbys
without
it
o
long
grain
and
wild
rice
husky
o
beans
youll
generate
enough
gas
alone
without
them
o
basically
anything
that
requires
heavy
digestive
processing
i
was
told
that
the
more
processed
the
food
the
better
rather
ironic
in
this
day
and
age
the
whole
point
is
preventative
you
want
to
give
your
system
as
little
chance
to
inflame
as
possible
i
was
told
that
among
the
numerous
things
that
were
heavily
discouraged
i
only
listed
a
few
to
try
the
ones
i
wanted
and
see
how
i
felt
if
its
bad
dont
do
it
again
remember
though
that
this
was
while
i
was
in
remission
for
veggies
cook
the
daylights
out
of
them
i
prefer
steaming
i
think
its
cooks
more
thoroughly
youre
mileage
may
vary

with
anything
else
check
with
your

dont

take

nebulisers

hi
we
are

on

have
a
wealth
of

on

to
adjudicate
a

next

although
the

is

for

to

there
seems
to
be
little
concensus
on
the
optimum
diameter
of
the

for

therapy
eg
for

some
say
that
the

must

say
that
if
they

they

all
your

really
has
to
do
is
find
a
registered
dieticianrd
while
most
work
in
hospitals

clinics
many
major
cities
will
have
rds
who
are
in
private
practice
so
to
speak
many
physicans
will
refer
their
patients
with
crohns
disease
to
rds
for
dietary
help
if
you
can
get
your

physician
to
make
a

medical
insurance
should
pay
for
the
rds
services
just
like
the
services
of
a
physical

the
better
medical
insurance
plans
will
cover
this
but
even
if
your

plan
doesnt
it
would
be
well
worth
the
cost
to
get
on
a
good
diet
to
control
the
intestinal
discomfort
and
help
the
intestinal
lining
heal
crohns
disease
is
an
inflammatory
disease
of
the
intestinal
lining
and
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
may
help
by
decreasing
leukotriene
formation
but
im
not
aware
of
tea
or
turmeric
containing
lipoxygenase
inhibitors
for
bad
inflammation
steroids
are
used
but
for
a

the
side
effects
are
not
worth
the

gained
by

upjohn
is

appers
one
driving
characteristic
of

their

choleric

a
etc
the
extreme
emotional
need
to
control
to
lead

to
be
the
best
or
the
most
competent
if
they
are
also
extroverted
they
are
best
described
as
field
marshalls
this
trait
is
very
valuable
and
essential
in
our
society
we
need
people
who
want
to
lead
to
strive
to
overcome
the
elements
to
seek
and
thirst
for
knowledge
to
raise
the
level
of
competency
etc
the
great
successes
in
science
and
technology
are
in
large
part
due
to
the
vision
an
n
trait
and
scientifically
minded
approach
t
trait
of
the
nt
personality
of
course
the
other
types
and
temperaments
have
their
own
positive
contributions
as
well
however
when
the
nt
person
has
selfimage
challenges
the
darkside
of
this
personality
type
usually
comes
out
which
should
be
obvious
to
all
a
physician
who
is
a
strong
nt
and
who
has
not
learned
to
temper
their
temperament
will
be
extremely
businesslike
lack
of
empathy
or
feeling
and
is
very
compelled
to
have
total
control
over
their
patient
the
patient
must
be
obedient
to
their
diagnosis
and
prescription
without
question
ive
known
many
mds
of
this
temperament
and
suffice
to
say
i
dont
oblige
them
with
a
followup
visit
no
matter
how
competent
i
think
they
are
and
they
usually
are
very
competent
from
a
knowledge
viewpoint
since
that
is
an
extreme
drive
of
theirs
to
know
the
most
to
know
it
all
maybe
we
need
more
nf
doctors
enough
on
this
subject
lets
move
on
to
candida
bloom
let
me
tell
you
who
the
quacks
really
are
these
are
the
physicans
who
have
no
idea
how
the
human
body
interacts
with
its
environment
and
how
that
balance
can
be
altered
by
diet
and
antibiotics
could
it
just
be
professional
jealousy
i
couldnt
help
elaine
or
jon
but
somebody
else
did
youve
helped
me
already
by
your
post
of
course
i
believe
that
i
have
been
misdiagnosed
on
the
net
as
suffering
from
anal
retentivitis
but
being
the
phlegmatic
i
am
maybe
i
was
just
a
little
too
harsh
on
a
few
people
myself
in
past
posts
lets
all
try
to
raise
the
level
of
this
discussion
above
the
level
of
anal
effluent
humans
have
all
kinds
of
different
organisms
living
in
the
gi
system
mouth
stomach
small
and
large
intestine
sinuses
vagina
and
on
the
skin
these
are
nonpathogenic
because
they
do
not
cause
disease
in
people
unless
the
immune
system
is
compromised
they
are
also
called
nonpathogens
because
unlike
the
pathogenic
organisms
that
cause
human
disease
they
do
not
produce
toxins
as
they
live
out
their
merry
existence
in
and
on
our
body
but
any
of
these
organisms
will
be
considered
pathogenic
if
it
manages
to
take
up
residence
within
the
body
a
poor
mucus
membrane
barrier
can
let
this
happen
and
vitamin
a
is
mainly
responsible
for
setting
up
this
barrier
in
my
welldescribed
situation
in
prior
posts
i
definitely
was
immune
stressed
blood
tests
showed
my
vitamin
a
levels
were
very
low
my
sinuses
were
a
mess
no
doubt
the
mucosal
lining
and
the
cilia
were
heavily
damaged
i
also
was
on
antibiotics
times
in
years
in
the
end
even
two
weeks
of
ceftin
did
not
work
and
i
had
confirmed
diagnoses
of
a
chronic
bacterial
infection
of
the
sinuses
via
catscans
mucus
color
wont
get
into
the
details
and
other
symptoms
three
very
traditional
ents
made
this
diagnosis
i
did
not
have
any
cultures
done
however
because
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
this
right
and
because
my
other
symptoms
clearly
showed
a
bacterial
infection
enough
of
this
background
provided
to
help
you
understand
where
i
was
when
i
make
comments
about
my
sporanox
antifungal
therapy
below
the
first
question
i
have
is
this
can
fungus
penetrate
a
little
way
into
poor
mucus
membrane
tissue
maybe
via
hyphae
thus
causing
symptoms
without
being
considered
systemic
in
the
classic
sense
it
is
sort
of
an
inbetween
infection
steve
got
real
upset
with
elaines
doctor
because
he
was
using
antifungals
and
vitamin
a
for
her
gi
problems
if
steve
really
understoood
what
vitamin
a
does
in
the
body
he
would
notor
at
least
should
not
be
calling
elaines
doctor
a
quack
i
was
concerned
too
because
of
the
toxicity
of
vitamin
a
my
doctor
after
my
blood
tests
put
me
on
iu
of
vitamin
a
for
one
week
only
then
dropped
it
down
to
iu
for
the
next
couple
of
weeks
i
also
received
zinc
and
other
supplementation
since
all
of
these
interrelate
in
fairly
complex
ways
as
my
doctor
explained
hes
one
of
those
evil
orthomolecular
specialists
i
had
a
blood
test
three
weeks
later
and
vitamin
a
was
normal
he
then
stopped
me
on
all
vitamin
a
except
for
some
in
a
multivitamin
supplement
and
made
sure
that
i
maintain
a
iuday
of
beta
carotene
call
me
carrot
face
hopefully
elaines
doctor
will
take
a
similar
careful
approach
and
to
all
supplements
im
even
reevaluating
some
supplements
im
taking
for
example
niacin
in
fairly
large
dosages
gramday
which
steve
dyer
had
good
information
about
on
scimednutrition
if
niacin
only
has
secondorder
improvement
in
symptomatic
relief
of
my
sinus
allergies
then
it
probably
is
not
worth
taking
such
a
large
dose
longterm
and
risking
liver
damage
survives
if
it
gets
access
to
a
lot
of
glucose
it
blooms
and
over
rides
the
other
organisms
living
with
it
in
the
sinuses
gi
tract
or
vagina
in
though
i
do
now
believe
based
on
my
successful
therapy
with
sporanox
that
i
definitely
had
some
excessive
growth
of
fungus
unknown
species
in
my
sinuses
i
still
want
to
ask
the
question
have
there
been
any
studies
that
demonstrate
candida
blooms
in
the
sinuses
with
associated
sinus
irritation
sinusitisrhinitis
my
sinus
irritation
reduced
significantly
after
one
week
of
sporanox
and
no
other
new
treatments
were
implemented
during
this
time
i
did
not
have
any
noticeable
gi
track
problems
before
starting
on
sporanox
but
some
for
a
few
days
after
which
then
went
away
considered
normal
btw
my
doctor
dug
out
one
of
his
medical
reference
books
sorry
cant
remember
which
one
and
found
an
obscure
comment
dating
back
into
the
which
stated
that
people
can
develop
contained
nonlethal
or
nonserious
aspergillis
infestations
aspergiliosis
of
the
sinuses
leading
to
sinus
inflammation
symptoms
ill
have
to
dig
out
that
reference
again
since
it
is
relevant
to
this
discussion
some
people
do
really
develop
a
bad
inflammatory
process
at
the
mucus
membrane
or
skin
bloom
site
whether
this
is
an
allergic
like
reaction
to
the
candida
or
not
isnt
certain
my
doctor
tested
me
i
believe
a
rast
or
rast
similar
test
for
allergic
response
to
specificially
candida
albicans
and
i
showed
a
strong
positive
another
question
would
everybody
show
the
same
strong
positive
so
this
test
is
essentially
useless
and
assuming
it
is
true
that
candida
can
grow
partway
into
the
mucus
membrane
tissue
and
the
concentration
exceeds
a
threshold
amount
could
not
a
person
who
tests
as
having
an
allergy
to
candida
definitely
develop
allergic
symptoms
such
as
mucus
membrane
irritation
due
to
the
bodys
allergic
response
as
i
said
in
an
earlier
post
one
does
not
need
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
or
have
a
md
degree
or
a
phd
in
biochemistry
to
see
the
plausibility
of
this
hypothesis
btw
and
ill
repost
this
again
dr
ivker
in
his
book
sinus
survival
has
routinely
given
before
anything
else
nizoral
a
presporanox
systemic
antifungal
not
as
safe
and
not
as
good
as
sporanox
to
his
new
chronic
sinusitis
patients
if
they
have
been
on
antibiotics
four
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
he
claims
that
out
of
or
so
patients
well
over
notice
some
relief
of
sinus
inflammation
and
other
symptoms
but
it
doesnt
cure
it
by
any
means
implying
the
socalled
yeastfungus
infection
is
not
the
primary
cause
but
a
later
complication
hes
also
found
that
nystatin
whether
taken
internally
or
put
into
a
sinus
spray
does
not
help
this
implies
of
course
assuming
that
excessive
yeastfungus
bloom
is
aggravating
the
sinus
inflammation
that
the
yeastfungus
has
grown
partway
into
the
tissue
since
nystatin
will
not
kill
yeastfungus
other
than
by
direct
contact
it
is
not
absorbed
into
the
blood
stream
again
i
admit
lots
of
ifs
and
implies
which
doesnt
please
the
hardcore
nt
who
has
to
have
the
doubleblind
study
or
its
a
nonissue
but
one
has
to
start
with
some
plausible
hypothesisexplanation
a
strawman
if
you
will
if
its
internal
only
symptoms
can
be
used
and
these
symptoms
are
pretty
nondescript
this
brings
up
an
interesting
observation
used
by
those
who
will
deny
and
reject
any
and
all
aspects
of
the
yeast
hypothesis
until
the
appropriate
studies
are
done
and
that
is
if
you
cant
observe
or
culture
the
yeast
bloom
in
the
gut
or
sinus
then
theres
no
way
to
diagnose
or
even
recognize
the
disease
and
i
know
they
realize
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
test
for
candida
overbloom
in
any
part
of
the
body
that
cannot
be
easily
observed
since
candida
is
everywhere
in
the
body
its
a
real
another
those
who
totally
reject
the
yeast
hypothesis
say
that
no
studies
have
been
done
actually
studies
have
been
done
but
if
its
not
up
to
a
certain
standard
then
it
is
from
their
perspective
a
nonstudy
which
should
not
even
be
considered
i
agree
that
the
appropriate
studies
should
be
done
and
that
will
take
big
to
do
it
right
however
in
order
to
convince
the
funding
agencies
in
these
austere
times
to
open
their
wallets
you
literally
have
to
give
them
evidence
and
the
only
acceptable
evidence
to
compete
with
other
proposals
is
paradoxically
to
do
almost
the
exact
study
needed
funding
that
is
you
have
to
do
of
the
study
before
you
even
get
funding
as
a
scientist
at
a
national
lab
im
very
aware
of
this
for
the
smaller
funded
projects
im
afraid
that
even
if
dr
ivker
and
other
doctors
got
together
pooled
their
practices
case
histories
and
anecdotes
into
a
compelling
picture
and
approach
the
funding
agencies
they
would
get
nowhere
even
if
they
were
able
to
publish
their
statistical
results
it
is
obvious
from
the
comments
by
some
of
the
doctors
here
is
that
they
have
decided
excessive
yeast
colonization
in
the
gut
or
sinuses
leading
to
noticeable
nonlethal
symptoms
does
not
exist
and
is
not
even
a
tenable
hypothesis
so
any
amount
of
case
histories
or
compiled
anecdotal
evidence
to
the
contrary
will
never
change
their
mind
and
not
only
that
they
would
also
oppose
the
needed
studies
because
in
their
minds
its
a
done
issue
excessive
yeast
growth
leading
to
diffuse
allergic
symptoms
does
not
will
not
and
cannot
exist
period
kind
of
tough
to
dialog
with
those
who
hold
such
a
viewpoint
kind
of
reminds
me
of
lister
candida
is
kept
in
check
in
most
people
by
the
normal
bacterial
flora
in
the
sinuses
the
gi
tractmouth
stomach
and
intestines
and
in
the
vaginal
tract
which
compete
with
it
for
food
the
human
immune
system
ususally
does
not
bother
itself
with
thesenonpathogenic
organisms
unless
they
broach
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
if
they
do
an
inflammatory
response
will
be
set
up
most
americans
are
not
getting
enough
vitamin
a
from
their
diets
about
of
all
americans
die
with
less
vitamin
a
than
they
were
born
withus
autopsy
studies
while
this
low
level
of
vitamin
a
does
not
cause
pathologyblindness
it
does
impair
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
this
would
then
be
a
predisposing
factor
for
a
strong
inflammatory
response
after
a
candida
bloom
arent
there
also
other
nutrients
necessary
to
the
proper
working
of
the
sinus
mucus
membranes
and
cilia
while
diabetics
can
suffer
from
a
candida
bloom
the
most
common
cause
of
this
type
of
bloom
is
the
use
of
broad
spectrum
antibiotics
which
knock
down
many
different
kinds
of
bacteria
in
the
body
and
remove
the
main
competition
for
candida
as
far
as
food
is
concerned
while
drugs
are
available
to
handle
candida
many
patients
find
that
their
doctor
will
not
use
them
unless
there
is
evidence
of
a
systemic
infection
the
toxicity
of
the
antifungal
drugs
does
warrant
some
caution
but
if
the
gi
or
sinus
inflammation
is
suspected
to
be
candidaand
recent
use
of
a
broad
spectrum
antibiotic
is
the
smoking
gun
then
antifungal
use
should
be
approrpriate
just
as
the
antifungal
creams
are
an
appropriate
treatment
for
recurring
vaginal
yeast
infections
in
spite
of
what
mr
steve
dyer
says
again
the
evidence
from
mycological
studies
indicate
that
many
yeastfungus
species
can
grow
hyphae
roots
into
deep
tissue
similar
to
mold
growing
in
bread
you
can
continue
to
kill
the
surface
such
as
nystatin
does
but
you
cant
kill
that
which
is
deeper
in
the
tissue
without
using
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
itraconazole
sporanox
or
some
of
the
older
ones
such
as
nizoral
which
are
more
toxic
and
not
as
effective
this
is
why
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
recent
studies
sent
to
me
by
a
doctor
ive
been
in
email
contact
with
thanks
that
nystatin
is
not
effective
in
the
long
term
treatment
of
gi
tract
candidiasis
its
like
trying
to
weed
a
garden
by
cutting
off
whats
above
the
ground
but
leaving
the
roots
ready
to
come
out
again
once
you
walk
away
the
question
is
whether
a
contained
candida
bloom
can
partially
grow
into
tissue
through
the
mucus
membranes
causing
some
types
of
symptoms
in
susceptible
people
eg
allergy
without
becoming
systemic
in
the
classical
sense
of
the
word
something
in
between
strictly
an
excessive
bloom
not
causing
any
problems
and
the
fullblown
systemic
infection
that
is
potentially
lethal
in
the
gi
system
the
anorectal
region
seems
to
be
a
particularly
good
reservoir
for
candida
and
the
use
of
pantyhose
by
many
women
creates
a
very
favorable
environment
around
the
rectum
for
transferthrough
moisture
and
humidity
of
candida
to
the
vaginal
tract
one
of
the
most
effctive
ways
to
minimmize
this
transfer
is
to
wear
undyed
cotton
underwear
also
if
one
is
an
anal
retentive
like
ive
been
diagnosed
in
a
prior
post
that
can
also
provide
more
sites
for
excessive
candida
growth
if
the
bloom
occurs
in
the
anal
area
the
burning
swelling
pain
and
even
blood
discharge
make
many
patients
think
that
they
have
hemorroids
if
the
bloom
manages
to
move
further
up
the
gi
tract
very
diffuse
symptomatology
occursabdominal
discomfort
and
blood
in
the
stool
this
positive
stool
for
occult
blood
is
what
sent
elaine
to
her
family
doctor
in
the
first
place
after
extensive
testing
he
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
but
her
gut
still
hurt
on
to
another
doctor
and
so
on
richard
kaplan
has
told
me
throiugh
email
that
he
considers
occult
blood
tests
in
stool
specimens
to
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
because
of
the
very
large
number
of
false
positivescandida
blooms
guys
if
my
gut
hurt
me
on
a
constant
basis
i
would
want
it
fixed
yes
its
nice
to
know
that
i
dont
have
colon
cancer
but
what
then
is
causing
my
distress
when
i
finally
find
a
doctor
who
treats
me
and
gets
me
better
steve
dyer
calls
him
a
quack
as
ive
said
in
private
email
there
are
flaws
in
our
current
medical
system
that
make
it
difficult
or
even
impossible
for
a
physician
to
attempt
alternative
therapies
after
the
approvedprovenaccepted
therapies
dont
work
for
example
i
went
to
three
ents
who
all
said
that
i
will
just
have
to
live
with
my
acutechronic
sinusitis
after
the
abs
failed
they
did
mention
surgery
to
open
up
the
ostia
but
my
ostia
werent
plugged
and
it
would
not
get
to
the
root
cause
of
my
condition
after
three
months
of
aggressive
and
fairly
nonstandard
therapy
sporanox
body
nutrient
level
monitoring
and
equalization
vitamin
c
lentinen
echinacea
etc
my
health
has
vastly
improved
to
where
i
was
two
years
ago
before
my
health
greatly
deteriorated
of
course
skeptics
would
say
that
maybe
if
i
did
nothing
i
would
have
improved
anyway
but
that
view
is
stretching
things
quite
far
because
of
the
experience
of
the
three
ents
i
saw
who
said
that
id
just
have
to
live
with
it
im
confident
i
will
reach
what
one
could
call
a
total
cure
the
antifungal
program
i
undertook
was
one
necessary
step
in
that
direction
because
of
my
overuse
of
abs
for
the
last
four
years
note
for
those
having
sinus
problems
may
i
suggest
the
book
by
dr
ivker
i
mention
above
be
sure
to
get
the
revised
edition
i
have
often
wondered
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinus
problems
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tells
his
patients
is
a
nonexistent
syndrome
dr
ivker
started
off
having
chronic
and
severe
sinus
problems
and
his
visits
to
several
ents
totally
floored
him
when
they
said
youll
just
have
to
live
with
it
he
spent
several
years
trying
everything
standard
and
nonstandard
until
he
was
essentially
cured
of
chronic
sinusitis
he
now
shares
his
approach
in
his
book
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
am
on
the
road
to
recovery
following
some
parts
of
it
his
one
recommendation
to
take
a
systemic
antifungal
at
the
beginning
of
treatment
if
you
have
a
history
of
antibiotic
overuse
has
been
proven
to
him
time
and
time
again
in
his
own
practice
im
sure
if
i
commented
to
him
of
the
hardcore
beliefs
of
the
anti
yeast
hypothesis
posters
that
he
would
have
definite
things
to
say
such
as
its
worked
wonders
for
me
in
almost
two
thousand
cases
to
put
it
mildly
i
also
would
not
be
surprised
if
he
would
say
that
they
are
the
ones
violating
their
moral
obligations
to
help
the
patient
maybe
those
doctors
who
are
reading
this
who
have
a
practice
and
are
confronted
by
a
patient
having
symptoms
that
could
be
due
to
the
hypothetical
yeast
overgrowth
eg
they
fit
some
of
the
profiles
the
proyeast
people
have
identified
should
consider
antifungal
therapy
if
all
other
avenues
have
been
exhausted
remember
theory
and
practice
are
two
different
things
you
cannot
have
one
without
the
other
they
are
synergistic
if
a
doctor
does
something
nonstandard
yet
produces
noticeable
symptomatic
relief
in
over
a
thousand
of
his
patients
shouldnt
you
at
least
sit
up
and
take
notice
maybe
you
ought
to
trust
what
he
says
and
begin
hypothesizing
why
it
works
instead
of
why
it
shouldnt
work
im
afraid
a
lot
of
doctors
have
become
so
enamored
with
scientific
correctness
that
they
are
ignoring
the
patients
they
have
sworn
to
help
you
have
to
do
both
both
have
to
be
balanced
which
we
dont
see
from
some
of
the
posters
to
this
group
there
comes
a
point
when
you
just
have
to
use
a
little
common
sense
and
maybe
an
empirical
approach
such
as
trying
a
good
systemic
antifungal
such
as
sporanox
after
having
exhausted
all
the
other
avenues
i
was
one
of
those
who
the
traditional
medical
establishment
was
not
able
to
help
so
i
did
the
natural
thing
i
went
to
a
couple
of
doctors
who
are
somewhat
outside
this
establishment
and
as
a
result
i
have
found
significant
relief
would
it
not
be
better
if
the
traditional
medical
establishment
can
set
up
some
kind
of
mechanism
where
any
doctor
without
fear
of
being
sued
or
having
his
license
pulled
can
try
experimental
and
unproven
beyond
a
doubt
therapies
for
hisher
patients
that
finally
reach
the
point
where
all
the
accepted
therapies
are
ineffective
id
like
to
hear
a
doctor
tell
me
well
ive
tried
all
the
therapies
that
are
approved
and
accepted
in
this
country
and
since
they
clearly
dont
work
for
you
i
now
have
the
authority
to
use
experimental
unproven
techniques
that
seem
to
have
helped
others
i
cant
promise
anything
and
there
are
some
risks
you
will
have
to
sign
something
saying
you
understand
the
experimental
and
possibly
risky
nature
of
these
unproven
therapies
and
ill
have
to
register
your
case
at
the
state
board
anyway
if
my
ent
had
suggested
this
to
me
i
wouldve
jumped
on
this
pronto
instead
of
going
to
one
of
those
doctors
who
for
either
altruistic
reasons
or
for
greed
is
practicing
these
alternative
therapies
with
much
risk
to
himher
risk
meaning
losing
their
license
and
possibly
to
the
patient
such
a
mechanism
would
keep
control
in
the
more
mainstream
medicine
and
also
provide
valuable
data
that
would
essentially
be
free
it
also
would
be
morally
and
ethically
better
than
the
current
system
by
showing
the
compassion
of
the
medical
community
to
the
patient
that
its
doing
everything
it
can
within
reason
to
help
the
patient
it
is
the
lack
of
such
a
mechanism
that
is
leading
large
numbers
of
people
to
try
alternative
therapies
some
of
which
seem
to
work
like
my
case
and
others
of
which
will
never
work
at
all
true
quackery
i
better
get
off
my
soapbox
before
this
post
reaches
in
size
if
taken
orally
it
can
also
become
a
major
bacteria
in
the
gut
through
aresol
sprays
it
has
also
been
used
to
innoculate
the
sinus
membranes
but
before
this
innoculation
occurs
the
mucus
membrane
barrier
system
needs
to
be
strengthened
this
is
accomplished
by
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
and
some
of
the
bcomplex
vitamins
diet
surveys
repeatedly
show
that
americans
are
not
getting
enough
and
folate
these
are
probably
the
segement
of
the
population
that
will
have
the
greatest
problem
with
this
nonexistent
disordercandida
blooms
after
antibiotic
therapy
what
dosage
of
appears
to
be
necessary
to
promote
the
healing
and
proper
working
of
the
mucos
memebranes
some
of
the
above
material
was
obtained
from
natural
healing
by
mark
bricklin
published
by
rodale
press
as
well
as
notes
from
my
human
nutrition
course
i
will
be
posting
a
discussion
of
vitamin
a
sometime
in
the
future
along
with
reference
citings
to
point
out
the
extremely
important
role
that
vitamin
a
plays
in
the
mucus
membrane
defense
system
in
the
body
and
why
vitamin
a
should
be
effective
in
dealing
with
candida
blooms
another
effective
dietary
treatment
is
to
restrict
carbohydrate
intake
during
the
treatment
phase
this
is
especially
important
if
the
gi
system
is
involved
if
candida
can
not
get
glucose
its
not
going
to
out
grow
the
bacteria
and
you
then
give
bacteria
which
can
use
amino
acids
and
fatty
acids
for
energy
a
chance
to
take
over
and
keep
the
candida
in
check
once
carbohydrate
is
returned
to
the
gut
id
like
to
see
the
role
of
complex
carbohydrates
such
as
starch
if
steve
and
some
of
the
other
naysayers
want
to
jump
all
over
this
post
fine
i
jumped
all
over
steve
in
sci
med
nutrition
because
he
verbably
accosted
a
poster
who
was
seeking
advice
about
her
doctors
use
of
vitamin
a
and
antifungals
for
a
candida
bloom
in
her
gut
people
seeking
advice
from
newsnet
should
not
be
treated
this
way
those
of
us
giving
of
our
time
and
knowledge
can
slug
it
out
to
our
hearts
content
if
you
saved
your
venom
for
me
steve
and
left
the
helpless
posters
who
are
timidly
seeking
help
alone
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
with
your
behavior
brave
soul
you
are
the
venom
on
usenet
can
be
quite
toxic
unless
one
develops
an
immunity
to
it
one
year
ago
my
phlegmatic
self
would
have
backed
down
right
away
from
an
attack
of
cholericitis
but
my
immune
system
and
my
computer
system
have
been
hardened
from
gradual
desensitization
i
now
kind
of
like
being
called
anal
retentive
it
has
a
nice
ring
to
it
i
also
was
very
impressed
by
how
it
just
flowed
into

truly

worthy

i
think
anecdotal

provided
there
is
a
lot
of
it
and
it
is
fairly
consistent
will
is
very
important
first
it
points
to
the
necessity
of
doing
a
study
and
second
it
at
least
says
that
the

are
all
psychological
or
possibly

in

case
as
ive
pointed

pyschological

cannot

to
another
person
on
an

there
is
no
clinical
evidence
that
those

are
always
going
to
happen
anyhow
that
was
a
pretty
lame
example
but
hopefully
i
made
my
point
its
all
a
matter
of
perception
and
as
long
as
someone
ingesting
msg
perceives
it
as
causing
bad
effects
then
she
can
definitely
experience
those
affects
on
the
other
hand
it
could
just
be
an
allergy
to
the
food
its
in

something
still
anecdotal

size
needle
and
choose
the
correct
spot
for
streptomycin
usually
given
intra

use
a
thin
needle
guage
and
select
a
spot
on
the
upper
outer
thigh
no
major
nerves
or
blood
vessels
there
clean
the
area
with
antiseptic
before
injection
and
after
make
sure
to
inject
deeply
a
different
kind
of
pain
is
felt
when
the
needle
enters
the
muscle
contrasted
to
the
prick
when
it
pierces
the
skin
ps
try
to
go
to
a
doctor
selftreatment
and
selfinjection
should
be
avoided
as
far
as
possible
the
areas
that
are
least
likely
to
hurt
are
where
you
have
a
little
fat
i
inject
on
my
legs
and
gut
and
prefer
the
gut
i
can
stick
it
in
at
a
degree
angle
and
barely
feel
it
im
not
fat
just
have
a
little
gut
my
legs
however
are
muscular
and
i
have
to
pinch
to
get
anything
and
then
i
inject
at
about
a
degree
angleand
it
still
hurts
the
rate
of
absorbtion
differs
for
subcutaneous
and
muscular
injections
howeverso
if
its
a
daily
thing
it
would
be
best
not
to
switch
places
every
day
to
keep
consistencey
although
some
suggest
switch
legs
or
sides
of
the
stomach
for
each
shot
to
prevent
irritation
when
you
clean
the
spot
off
with
an
alcohol
prep
wait
for
it
to
dry
somewhat
or
you
may
get
the
alcohol
in
the
puncture
and
of
course
that
doesnt
feel
good
a
way
to
prevent
irratation
is
to
mark
the
spot
that
you
injected
a
good
way
to
do
this
is
use
a
little
round
bandage
and
put
it
over
the
spot
this
helps
prevent
you
from
injecting
in
the
same
spot
and
spacing
the
sites
out
accuartely
about
apart
this
is
from
experience
so
i
hope
itll
help
you
i
have
diabetes
and
have
to
take
an
injection
every
morning
later

hi
ive
just
returned
from
a
visit
with
my
obgyn
and
i
have
a
few
concerns
that
maybe
yall
can
help
me
with
ive
been
seeing
her
every
weeks
for
the
past
few
months
im
at
week
and
during
the
last
visits
ive
gained
to
pounds
every
weeks
she
said
this
was
unacceptable
over
any
week
period
as
it
stands
ive
thus
far
gained
pounds
also
she
says
that
though
im
at
weeks
the
babys
size
is
weeks
i
think
she
mentioned
inches
for
the
top
of
the
fundus
when
i
was
weeks
the
babys
size
was
weeks
i
must
also
add
that
i
had
an
operation
a
few
years
ago
for
endometriosis
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
endometriosis
but
apparently
it
is
causing
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
during
the
pregnancy
and
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
moving
and
the
doc
has
recommended
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
little
handicapped
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
thats
of
the
situation
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
i
was
getting
sick
throwing
up
about
times
a
day
and
mostly
it
was
bile
that
was
being
eliminated
i
told
her
about
this
i
know
this
because
i
wasnt
eating
very
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
results
well
now
i
only
get
sick
about
once
every
weeks
and
it
is
still
bile
related
but
in
addition
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usually
when
i
was
lying
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
worse
though
because
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
im
not
taking
in
fat
is
she
expecting
the
baby
will
take
it
from
my
stores
and
why
this
restriction
on
carbohydrates
if
shes
concerned
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommendation
is
based
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistatis
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
information
on
she
originally
said
that
i
should
only
gain
pounds
during
the
entire
pregnancy
since
i
was
about
lbs
overweight
when
i
started
but
my
sister
gained
lbs
during
her
pregnancy
and
shes
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
any
problems
she
also
asked
if
any
members
of
my
family
were
obese
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overly
concerned
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
being
punished
by
a
severe
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporary
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reasonable
is
this
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
since
im
trying
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
really
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assumes
i
must
be
eating
a
highfat
diet
but
really
it
is
that
because
of
the
endometriosis
and
the
operation
im
not
able
to
use
the
energy
from
the
food
i
do
eat
any
opinions
info
and
experiences
will
be
appreciated
im
truly
going
stark
raving
mad
trying
to
meet
this
new
strict
diet
because
fruits
and
vegetables
go
through
my
system
in
a
few
minutes
and
ill
end
up
having
to
eat
constantly
thus
far
i
dont

any

interesting
statements
simply
because
i
have
been
told
otherwise
im
certainly
not
questioning
steves
claims
as
for
one
i
am
not
a
doctor
and
i
agree
that
foods
dont
bring
on
the
recurrence
of
crohns
but
inflammation
can
be
either
mildly
or
drastically
enhanced
due
to
food
the
feeling
obout
this
has
changed
in
the
gi
community
the
current
feeling
is
that
inflammation
is
not
induced
by
food
there
is
even
evidence
that
patients
deprived
of
food
have
mucosal
atrophy
due
to
lack
of
stimulation
of
intestinal
growth
factors
there
is
now
interest
in
providing
small
amounts
of
nasogastric
feeding
to
patients
on
iv
nutrition
but
i
digress
symptoms
can
be
drastically
enhanced
by
food
but
not
inflammation
having
had
one
major
obstruction
resulting
in
resection
is
that
a
good
enough
caveat
i
was
told
that
a
low
residue
diet
is
called
for
basically
the
idea
is
that
if
there
is
inflammation
of
the
gut
which
may
not
be
realized
by
the
patient
any
residue
in
the
system
can
be
caught
in
the
folds
of
inflammation
and
constantly
irritate
thus
exacerbating
the
problem
therefore
anything
that
doesnt
digest
completely
by
the
point
of
common
inflammation
should
be
avoided
with
what
ive
been
told
is
typical
crohns
of
the
terminal
ileum
my
diet
should
be
low
residue
consisting
of
completely
out
never
again
items
o
corn
kernel
husk
doesnt
digest
most
of
us
know
this
o
popcorn
same
o
dried
dehydrated
fruit
and
fruit
skins
o
nuts
very
tough
when
it
comes
to
giving
up
some
fudge
the
low
residue
diet
is
appropriate
for
you
if
you
still
have
obstructions
again
it
is
not
felt
that
food
causes
inflammation
these
foods
are
avoided
because
they
may
get
stuck
id
go
ahead
and
have
the
fudge
though
discouraged
greatly
o
raw
vegetables
too
fibrous
o
wheat
and
raw
grain
breads
o
exotic
lettuce
iceberg
is
ok
since
its
apparently
mostly
water
o
greens
turnip
mustard
kale
etc
o
little
seeds
like
sesame
try
getting
an
arbys
without
it
o
long
grain
and
wild
rice
husky
o
beans
youll
generate
enough
gas
alone
without
them
o
basically
anything
that
requires
heavy
digestive
processing
i
was
told
that
the
more
processed
the
food
the
better
rather
ironic
in
this
day
and
age
the
whole
point
is
preventative
you
want
to
give
your
system
as
little
chance
to
inflame
as
possible
i
was
told
that
among
the
numerous
things
that
were
heavily
discouraged
i
only
listed
a
few
to
try
the
ones
i
wanted
and
see
how
i
felt
if
its
bad
dont
do
it
again
remember
though
that
this
was
while
i
was
in
remission
for
veggies
cook
the
daylights
out
of
them
i
prefer
steaming
i
think
its
cooks
more
thoroughly
youre
mileage
may
vary
as
with
anything
else
check
with
your
doctor
dont
just
take
my
word
but
this
is
the
info
ive
been
given
and
it
may
be
a
starting
point
for
discussion
good
luck
spencer
makes
an
especially
good
point
in
having
an
observant
and
informed
patient
would
that
many
patients
be
able
to
tell
what
causes
them
problems
the
digestive
processing
idea
is
changing
but
if
a
food
causes
problems
avoid
them
be
sure
that
the
foods
are
tested
a
second
time
to
be
sure
the
food
is
a
real
cause
crohns
commonly
causes
intermittent
symptoms
and
some
patients
end
up
with
severly
restricted
diets
that
take
months
to
renormalize
there
was
a
good
article
in
the
ccfa
newsletter
recently
that
discussed
the
issue
of
dietary
restriction
of
fiber
it
would
be
worth
reading
to
anyone
with
an
interest
in
crohns
and
as
i
always
say
when
dealing
with
crohns
as
does

all
your

really
has
to
do
is
find
a

dieticianrd
while
most
work
in
hospitals

clinics
many
major
cities
will
have
rds
who
are
in

so
to
speak
many
physicans
will
refer
their

with

disease
to
rds
for
dietary
help
if
you
can
get
your

physician
to
make

medical

just

the

of

the
better
medical

will
cover

even
if

doesnt

would

is

may

in

out

one

way

is
to
increase
your

which
will
prevent

an

intake
of
mg
per

for
males
and
per

for
females
living
in
the
us
coupled
with
this
low

was
a
high
protein

greatly
increases
the
requirement
as
well
as
the
presence

some
of
the
different
drugs
that
either
block

are
metabolic
antagonists

promote

ones

tell
my

to
supplement

their

get
any
of
the
drugs
that
increase
the
requirement
the
dose
recommended
for

is

and
this
should
work
for

would

that
has

the

i
have

a

recently
concerning

i
am
also
interested

i
have
a

i
posted

no

but
here
it
is
again
is
anyone
interested
in
participating
in
a
mailing

on

this
would
allow
us
to
hold
discussions
and
share

i
already
run

are

the

all

okay
this
is
a

my

robin
has
recurring
bouts
of
mononucleosistype
symptoms
very
regularly
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
number
of
years
shes
seen
a
number
of
doctors
six
was
the
last
count
i
think
most
of
them
have
said
either
you
have
mono
or
youre
full
of
it
theres
nothing
wrong
with
you
one
has
admitted
to
having
no
idea
what
was
wrong
with
her
and
one
has
claimed
that
it
is
epsteinbarr
syndrome
now
what
she
told
me
about
ebs
is
that
very
few
doctors
even
believe
that
it
exists
obviously
this
has
been
her
experience
so
whats
the
story
is
it
real
does
the
medical
profession
believe
it
to
be
real
has
anyone
had
success
is
treating
ebs
or
is
it
just
something
to
live
with
thanks
for
your
assistance
outbreaks
of
a
chronicmonolike
entity
were
originally
called
ebs
or
some
variant
thereof
because
most
of
the
people
with
this
disease
had
elevated
levels
of
antibodies
to
the
ebv
virus
but
not
all
of
them
did
which
prompted
an
official
renaming
of
the
disease
to
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
this
renaming
took
place
in
the
annals
of
internal
medicine
jan
i
believe
now
its
also
called
chronic
fatigue
and
immune
dysfunction
syndrome
cfids
since
it
seems
clear
that
some
sort
of
immune
disregulation
is
causing
the
probs
astonishly
there
are
still
docs
who
tell
people
with
massively
swollen
glands
recurrent
fevers
and
nightsweats
etc
that
theres
nothing
wrong
with
them
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
syndrome
may
have
a
at
least
partly
psychological
cause
the
disagreement
among
people
whose
thoughts
are
worth
considering
centers
on
just
what
the
cause
is
no
one
knows
but
theories
include
psychological
stress
some
sort
of
virus
a
retrovirus
say
most
maybe
one
of
the
newly
discovered
herpes
viruses
environmental
toxins
bacteria
and
yes
candida
genes
andor
some
combo
of
these
theres
no
outright
cure
at
the
moment
but
different
docs
try
different
things
some
of
which
seem

is
an
error

healers
have
had
a
long
history
of

some
have
stuck

others
have
been

the
key
has

oath
i
will
do
no

but
you
know
david
that
very
few
treatments
involve
no
risk
to
the
patient
the
job
of
the
physician
is
a
very
difficult
one
when
risk
versus
benefit
has
to
be
weighed
each
physician
deals
with
this
riskbenefit
paradox
a
little
differently
some
are
very
conservative
while
others
are
more
agressive
an
agressive
approach
may
be
more
costly
to

carry
more
risk

as

these

lurk

waiting

some
of

are
really
doing

pretty
good
job

providing
alternative

many
lack
any

do
you
believe

how
about

is
being
a

enough
to
guarantee
that
someone
is
not

or
is
it
just
that
even
if

can
you

for

at

all
for
making

i
would
not

the

in

is
significantly
inflated
by
these
quacks
of
a

in
fact
id
say
these

are
the
most
dangerous
since
they
call
into
question
the
true
focus
of
the
medical
profession
the
ama
and
the

should
focus
on
these
quacks
instead
of
devoting
unbelievable
energy
on

to
pull
the
licenses
of
those
doctors
who
are
trying
non
traditional
or
not
fully

for
their
desperate
patients
that
traditionalaccepted
medicine
cannot
help
now
to
make
a
general
comment
on
many
recent
posts
lately
ive
seen
the
word
quack
bandied
about
recklessly
when
a
doctor
or
doctorwannabe
has
decided
to
quit
discussing
any
controversial
medical
subject
in
a
civilized
manner
all
heshe
has
to
do
is
say
quackquack
and
somehow
they
magically
expect
the
readership
of
this
newsgroup
to
roll
over
on
their
backs
and
peepee
on
themselves
in
obedience
what
do
they
teach
you
in
medical
school
how
to
throw
your
authority
around
let
me
put
it
another
way
to
make
my
point
clear
quack
is
a
nebulous
word
lacking
in
any
precision
its
sole
use
is
to
obfuscate
the
issues
at
hand
the
indiscriminate
use
of
this
word
is
a
sure
sign
of
incompetency
and
coming
from
any
medical
doctor
or
wannabe
where
competency
is
expected
is
real
scary
but
what
do
i
know
ive
already

esophagitis
the
names
of
a
doctors
who
specialize
in
such
surgery
information
on
reflux
esophagitis
which
leads
to
cancer
my
boyfriend
age
and
otherwise
in
good
health
was
diagnosed
with
reflux
esophagitis
and
a
hiatal
hernia
about
years
ago
at
that
time
he
saw
a
gastroenterologist
and
has
tried
acid
controllers
mylanta
tagamet
as
well
as
a
restricted
diet
and
raising
the
head
of
his
bed
these
treatments
were
not
effective
and
because
the
damage
was
worsening
he
opted
for
a
surgical
repair
months
ago
he
was
told
there
were
two
repair
techniques
that
could
fix
the
problem
a
nissen
wrap
and
a
hill
repair
he
opted
for
the
hill
repair
he
recovered
very
well
from
the
surgery
itself
but
the
pain
he
had
originally
is
worse
and
in
addition
he
now
has
trouble
swallowing
including
saliva
the
doctor
now
wants
to
do
an
endoscopy
and
has
also
informed
him
that
a
biopsy
might
be
necessary
if
he
has
a
precancerous
condition
which
he
called
barretts
syndrome
if
he
cant
avoid
having
reflux
will
he
necessarily
get
cancer
basically
if
anyone
has
any
information
on
what
he
should
do
now
id
appreciate
it

does
anyone
know
about
this
i
also
heard
this
i
always
thought
it
might
make
a
good
eposide
of
columbo
for
someone
to
be
poisoned
with
heavy
water
it
wouldnt
show
up
in
any
chemical
test
no
one
else
seems
to
know
so
ill
post
this
this
topic
came
up
on
sciphysicsfusion
shortly
after
the
coldfusion
flap
started
as
i
recall
its
been
done
to
some
experimental
mice
they
showed
various
ill
effects
and
eventually
died
the
reason
is
that
deuterium
does
not
have
exactly
the
same
reaction
rates
as
hydrogen
due
to
its
extra
mass
which
causes
lower
velocity
boltzman
constant
mumble
this
throws
various
bits
of
body
biochemistry
out
of
kilter
and
you
get
sick
and
die
ive
never
heard
of
anyone
being
poisened
this
way
in
or
out
of
real
life
the
process
takes
quite
a
while
if
anyone
wants
to
write
this
book
i
would
imagine
you
would
have
to
replace
a
significant
fraction
of
the
water
in
the
body
with
heavy
water
wait
while
normal
breakdown
and
repair
processes
cause
other
molecules
in
the
body
to
be
synthesised
using
the
deuterium
during
this
process
the
victim
would
gradually
deteriorate
and
eventually
die
but
i
imagine
it
would
take
weeks
during
which
the
poisoner
would
have
to
ensure
that
a
significant
proportion
of
the
water
the
victim
ingested
was
heavy
you
would
get
such
a
mess
of
symptoms
that
the
doctors
would
be
both
alarmed
and
confused
why
should
every
organ
in
the
body
suddenly
begin
to
deteriorate
if
you
can
figure
out
how
the
poisoner
gets
the
heavy
water
into
the
victim
in
a
hospital
then
you
could
have
a
real
story
here
come
to
think
of
it
would
continue
even
after
the
heavy
water
was
no
longer
being
ingested
so
hospitalisation
might
be
too
late
the
most
detectable
effect
would
be
that
the
victims
body
fluids
would
literally
be
heavy
water
has
a
molecular
weight
of
and
heavy
water
has
a
mw
of
thus
the
victims
weight
will
increase
by
about
for
every
of
body
water
replaced
by
heavy
water
maybe
the
detection
occurs
because
some
pathologist
in
the
lab
notices
that
the
victims
urine
is
strangely
dense
is
there
any
medical
test
involving
the
specific
gravity
of
a

fluid

my
obgyn
and
i
have
a
few
concerns
that
maybe
yall
can
help
me
with
ive
been
seeing
her
every
weeks
for
the
past
few
months
im
at
week
and
during
the
last
visits
ive
gained
to
pounds
every
weeks
she
said
this
was
unacceptable
over
any
week
period
as
it
stands
ive
thus
far
gained
pounds
also
she
says
that
though
im
at
weeks
the
babys
size
is
weeks
i
think
she
mentioned
inches
for
the
top
of
the
fundus
when
i
was
weeks
the
babys
size
was
weeks
i
must
also
add
that
i
had
an
operation
a
few
years
ago
for
endometriosis
and
ive
had
no
problems
with
endometriosis
but
apparently
it
is
causing
me
pain
in
my
pelvic
region
during
the
pregnancy
and
i
have
a
very
difficult
time
moving
and
the
doc
has
recommended
i
not
walk
or
move
unless
i
have
to
i
have
a
little
handicapped
sticker
for
when
i
do
need
to
go
out
anyway
thats
of
the
situation
the
other
is
that
almost
from
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
i
was
getting
sick
throwing
up
about
times
a
day
and
mostly
it
was
bile
that
was
being
eliminated
i
told
her
about
this
i
know
this
because
i
wasnt
eating
very
much
due
to
the
nausea
and
could
see
the
results
well
now
i
only
get
sick
about
once
every
weeks
and
it
is
still
bile
related
but
in
addition
i
had
begun
to
feel
movement
near
my
upper
right
abdomen
just
below
the
right
breast
usually
when
i
was
lying
on
my
right
side
it
began
to
get
worse
though
because
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
im
not
taking
in
fat
is
she
expecting
the
baby
will
take
it
from
my
stores
and
why
this
restriction
on
carbohydrates
if
shes
concerned
about
fat
im
not
clear
how
much
of
her
recommendation
is
based
on
my
weight
gain
and
how
much
on
cholistatis
which
i
cant
seem
to
find
any
information
on
she
originally
said
that
i
should
only
gain
pounds
during
the
entire
pregnancy
since
i
was
about
lbs
overweight
when
i
started
but
my
sister
gained
lbs
during
her
pregnancy
and
shes
taken
it
all
off
and
hasnt
had
any
problems
she
also
asked
if
any
members
of
my
family
were
obese
which
none
of
them
are
anyway
i
think
she
is
overly
concerned
about
weight
gain
and
feel
like
im
being
punished
by
a
severe
diet
she
did
want
to
see
me
again
in
one
week
so
i
think
she
the
diet
may
be
temporary
for
that
one
week
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
reasonable
is
this
nonfat
diet
i
would
understand
if
she
had
said
lowfat
diet
since
im
trying
that
anyway
even
if
she
said
really
lowfat
diet
i
think
she
assumes
i
must
be
eating
a
highfat
diet
but
really
it
is
that
because
of
the
endometriosis
and
the
operation
im
not
able
to
use
the
energy
from
the
food
i
do
eat
any
opinions
info
and
experiences
will
be
appreciated
im
truly
going
stark
raving
mad
trying
to
meet
this
new
strict
diet
because
fruits
and
vegetables
go
through
my
system
in
a
few
minutes
and
ill
end
up
having
to
eat
constantly
thus
far
i
dont
find
any
foods
satisfying
thanks
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their

arguments
abound
when
there
arent
any
firm
answers
plenty
of
illnesses
arent
or
cant
be
diagnosed
or
treated
but
i
think
its
better
to
argue
against
the
theory
as
was
originally
done
with
postings
on
candida
a
month
or
so
ago
stating
the
facts
usually
works
better
than
simply
asserting
an
opinion
about
someones
competency
and
you
cant
convince
everybody
sometimes
a
correct
diagnosis
takes
years
for
people
they
dont
run
into
a
doctor
who
recognizes
the
disease
they
havent
developed
something
recognizable
yet
or
they
have
something
that
no
one
is
going
to
recognize
because
it
hasnt
been
described
yet
sometimes
they
get
a
cure
sometimes
the
illness
wears
out
sometimes
they
stumble
on
an
improper
diagnosis
with
the
right
treatment
sometimes
they
find
its
incurable
there
is
no
profit
in
a
patient
accepting
a
hopeless
attitude
about
an
illness
unless
its
a
rock
solid
diagnosis
of
terminal
disease
its
is
more
like
ly
that
a

will

bandied
about
recklessly
actually
i
almost
never
use
the
term
quack
when

systemic

i
always

views
this

i
agree
with

let
me
put
it
another

to
make
my

clear
quack

lacking

really
i

my

asked
another

in

if
they
read
the

themselves
or
if

had

read

the

very
vehemently
insisted
that
they
were

were
not
my

is
concerned
about
this
she
saw
a

show
a
couple
months
back
something
like

dateline

where
an
expert
on
fetal
ultrasounds
a
radiologist
was
showing
all
the
different
deffects
that
could
be
detected
using
the

should
my

be
concerned
should
we
take
the
pictures
to
a
radiologist
for
a

and
if
so
where
would
we
find
such
an
expert
in
chicago
we
dont
really
have
any
special
medical
reason
to
be
concerned
but
if
a
radiologist
will
be
able

see
things
the

cant
then
i
dont
see
why
we
shouldnt
use
one
any
thoughts
as
far
as
i
can
see
if
your
obstetrition
has
an
ultrasound
in
his
rooms
and
is
expirienced
its
use
and
interpretation
he
should
be
just
as
capable
of
reading
it
as
any
radiologist
all
doctors
are
qualified
to
read
xrays
us
ct
scans
etc
it
is
just
that
a
radiologist
does
nothing
else
and
thus
is
only
better
at
reading
them
because
of
all
this
time
spent
doing
this
skill
in
reading
xrays
etc
just
comes
from
plenty
of
practice
if
your

reads
heaps
of
obstetric

he
should
be

noring
and
the
fellow
from

sorry
forgot
your

have
also
suggested
one
set
of
anecdotal
evidence
in
favor
based
on
their
personal
experiences
namely
that
when
people
with
certain
conditions
are
given
antifungals
many
of
them
appear
to
get
better
so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
please
there
is
no
point
in
yelling
back
and
forth
at
each
other
any
longer
since
neither
side
has
any
convincing
evidence
either
positive
or
negative
and
i
understand
that
your
abject
disbelief
is
based
on
the
existence
of
people
who
may
get
famous
or
make
money
applying
the
diagnosis
to
everything
in
sight
making
wild
claims
with
no
evidence
and
always
refusing
to
do
controlled
studies
but
that
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
apparently
sincere
experiences
of
the
people
on
the
net
observing
antifungals
working
on
themselves
and
other
people
in
certain
specific
cases
there
are
also
quacks
who
sell
oral
superoxide
dismutase
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
completely
broken
down
in
the
guts
but
this
doesnt
change
the
genuine
scientific
knowledge
about
the
role
of
superoxide
dismutase
in
fighting
oxidative
damage
same
thing
just
cause
there
are
candida
quacks
that
doesnt
establish
evidence
against
the
candida
hypothesis
if
theres
some
other
reason
besides
the
quacks
if
only
anecdotal
to
think
it
could
be
true
then
that
is
what
has
to
be
considered
that
is
what
the
net
people
have
been
talking
about
but
again
there
is
no
point
in
arguing
about
it
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
and
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
and
there
are
also
some
candida
quacks
out
there
i
hope
everyone
can
agree
on
all
of
that
thus
it
appears
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
proponents
can
marshall
enough
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
convincing
and
documented
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carrying
out
a
good
controlled
doubleblind
study
of
antifungals
or
else
forget
convincing
anybody
else
to
carry
out
the
test
just
carry
it
out
themselves
and
also
whether
they
can
adequately
define
the
patient
population

on

sweets
syndrome
my

syndrome
also
called
steroid

syndrome
this
syndrome
started
after
she
had
had
iodine
treatment
for
hyperthyroidism
shed
been
reluctant
to
have
treatment
for
the
hyperthyroidism
for
many
years
and
apparently
started
to
show
exaustion
from
it
i
understand
that
she
may
still
be
testing
high
in
thyroid
level
but
shes
isnt
being
treated
by
an
endocrinologist
her
previous
endocrinologist
bowed
out
when
she
entered
the
hospital
she
entered
the
hospital
because

symptoms

ive
looked
through
the
last
two
years

and
didnt

thyroid
and

i
checked

mujanovic
was
a
pathologist
when
he
trekked
through
the
mountains
to
the
besieged
muslim
town
of
srebrenica
last
august
but
after
treating
mangled
victims
of
bosnias
bloody
war
he
considers
himself
a
surgeon
now
im
a
surgeon
with
great
experience
although
i
have
no
license
to
practice
but
if
i
operate
on
a
person
and
he
lives
normally
thats
the
greatest
license
a
surgeon
could
have
evacuated
by
the
un
this
week
to
his
home
town
of
tuzla
the
muslim
physician
gave
an
eyewitness
medical
assessment
of
the
horrors
of
the
yearlong
serb
siege
of
srebrenica
and
the
suffering
of
the
thousands
trapped
there
i
lived
through
hell
together
with
the
people
of
srebrenica
all
those
who
lived
through
this
are
the
greatest
heroes
that
humanity
can
produce
he
told
reporters
mujanovic
had
practiced
for
two
months
as
an
assistant
at
a
local
hospital
in
tuzla
but
before
going
to
srebrenica
he
had
never
performed
a
surgical
operation
on
his
own
now
he
says
he
has
performed
major
surgery
times
relying
on
books
for
guidance
amputating
arms
and
legs
times
usually
without
anesthetic
delivering
babies
and
performing
four
cesarean
sections
he
worked
days
slept
in
the
hospital
for
the
first
weeks
after
his
arrival
last
aug
and
treated
patients
he
arrived
after
making
the
trek
over
mountains
on
foot
from
tuzla
miles
northwest
of
srebrenica
about
other
people
carried
in
supplies
and
soldiers
guided
and
protected
him
through
guerrilla
terrain
he
said
his
worst
memory
was
of
days
ago
when
seven
serb
shells
landed
within
one
minute
in
an
area
half
the
size
of
a
football
field
killing
people
immediately
and
wounding
half
of
the
dead
were
women
and
children
the
people
had
come
out
for
a
rare
day
of
sunshine
and
the
children
were
playing
soccer
there
was
no
warning
the
blood
flowed
like
a
river
in
the
street
he
said
there
were
pieces
of
women
all
around
and
you
could
not
piece
them
together
one
woman
holding
her
two
children
in
her
hands
was
lying
with
them
on
the
ground
dead
they
had
no
heads
before
mujanovic
arrived
with
his
supplies
conditions
were
deplorable
he
said
many
deaths
could
have
been
prevented
had
the
hospital
had
surgical
tools
facilities
and
medicine
the
six
general
practitioners
who
had
been
operating
before
he
arrived
had
even
less
surgical
experience
than
he
did
they
didnt
know
the
basic
principles
for
amputating
limbs
once
he
arrived
the
situation
improved
he
said
but
by
midseptember
he
had
run
out
of
supplies
bandages
were
washed
and
boiled
five
times
sometimes
they
were
falling
apart
in
my
hands
he
said
doctors
had
no
anesthetic
and
could
not
give
patients
alcohol
to
numb
the
pain
because
it
increased
bleeding
people
were
completely
conscious
during
amputations
and
stomach
operations
he
said
blood
transfusions
were
impossible
because
they
had
no
facilities
to
test
blood
types
i
felt
destroyed
psychologically
mujanovic
said
the
situation
improved
after
dec
when
a
convoy
arrived
from
the
belgian
medical
group
medecins
sans
frontieres
but
mujanovic
said
the
military
predicament
worsened
in
middecember
after
bosnian
serbs
began
a
major
offensive
in
the
region
every
day
we
had
air
strikes
and
shellings
then
the
hunger
set
in
between
middecember
and
midmarch
when
us
planes
began
air
dropping
food
between
and
people
were
dying
every
day
from
complications
associated
with
malnutrition
he
said
i
know
for
sure
that
the
air
drop
operation
saved
the
people
from
massive
death
by
hunger
and
starvation
he
said
according
to
mujanovic
around
people
died
in
srebrenica
of
them
children
during
a
year
of
siege
mujanovic
plans
to
return
to
srebrenica
in
three
weeks
after
visiting
his
wife
who
is
ill
in
tuzla
they
say
im
a
hero
he
said
there
were
thousands
of
people
standing
at
the
sides
of
the
road
crying
and
waving
when
i
left
and
i
cried

i
do

one

on

infections
i
can
understand
the
skepticism
of
those
who
see
this
associated
with
various
general
kinds
of
symptoms
while
there
is
a
lack
of
solid
demonstration
that
this
happens
and
causes
such
general
symptoms
to
understand
this
skepticism
one
only
needs
to
know
of
past
failures
that
shared
these
characteristics
with
the
notion
of
hidden
candida
infection
there
have
been
quite
a
few
and
the
proponents
of
all
thought
that
the
skeptics
were
overly
skeptical
on
the
other
hand
i
am
happy
to
read
that
some
people
are
sufficiently
interested
in
this
possibility
spurred
by
suggestive
clinical
experience
to
research
it
further
the
doubters
may
be

how

let
me
put
it
another
way
to
make
my
point
clear
quack
is
a
nebulous
word
lacking
in
any
precision
its
sole
use
is
to
obfuscate
the
issues
at
hand
funny
i
thought
it
meant
one
who
fraudulently
misrepresents
his
ability
and
experience
in
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
disease
or
the
effects
to
be
achieved
by
the
treatment
he
offers
dorlands
certainly
more
precision
than
conveyed
by
chronic
yeast
the
indiscriminate
use
of
this
word
is
a
sure
sign
of
incompetency
and
coming
from
any
medical
doctor
or
wannabe
where
competency
is
expected
is
real
scary
the
inability
to
discriminate
between
fraudulent
or
erroneous
representations
is
far
more
frightening
it
is
fraud
to
promote
a
treatment
where
the
evidence
for
it
is
either
lacking
or
against
it
and
the
quacksalver
knows
so
or
error
if
the
honest
practitioner
doesnt
know
so
failure
to
speak
out
against
either
bespeaks
incompetency
ps
may
i
suggest
seriously
that
if
the
doctors
and

on
the

who
refuse
to
have
an
open

the

i
reply
seriously
that
if
the
practitioners

nonscientific
medicine
have
left
their
minds
so
open
that
the

sorry
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggested
one
set
of
anecdotal
evidence
in
favor
based
on
their
personal
experiences
namely
that
when
people
with
certain
conditions
are
given
antifungals
many
of
them
appear
to
get
better
gee
i
have
many
interesting
and
enlightening
anecdotes
about
myself
my
friends
and
my
family
but
in
the
practice
of
medicine
i
expect
and
demand
more
rigorous
rationales
for
basing
therapy
than
aunt
susies
brotherinlaw
anecdotal
evidence
may
provide
inspiration
for
a
hypothesis
but
rarely
proves
anything
in
a
positive
sense
and
unlike
mathematics
boolean
logic
rarely
applies
directly
to
medical
issues
and
so
evidence
of
exceptions
does
not
usually
disprove
but
rather
modifies
current
concepts
of
disease
so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
please
there
is
no
point
in
yelling
back
and
forth
at
each
other
any
longer
since
neither
side
has
any
convincing
evidence
either
positive
or
negative
i
would
characterize
it
not
as
abject
disbelief
but
rather
scientific
outrage
over
vastly
overstated
conclusions
it
appears
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
proponents
can
marshall
enough
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
convincing
and
documented
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carrying
out
a
good
controlled
doubleblind
study
of
antifungals
or
else
forget
convincing
anybody
else
to
carry
out
the
test
just
carry
it
out
themselves
and
also
whether
they
can
adequately
define
the
patient
population
or
symptoms
on
which
such
a
study
should
be
carried
out
to
provide
a
fair
test
of
the
hypothesis
i
have
no
problem
with
such
an
approach

after
having
some

with
walking
and
writing
she
is
years
old
otherwise
she
is
in

health
the
discovery
was
made
via
cat
scans
she
then
had
mri
scans
done
where
small
cancerous
areas
were
discovered
in
her
lungs
biopsies
showed
it
to
be
adenocarcinoma
one
spot
is
in
the
lungs
and
another
in
the
pneumothorax
the
oncologists
believe
the
cancer
started
in
the
lungs
and
caused
the
brain
tumor
she
smoked
until
four
years
ago
anyway
id
like
feedback
as
to
what
adenocarcinoma
is
how
it
is
different
from
other
cancers
how
she
will
be
treated
luckily
the
tumor
is
right
below
the
skull
and
can
be
easily
removed
and
statistically
what
are
the
chances
for
full

it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
nonfat
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
first
even
fish
fowl
and
breads
have
fat
second
the
body
will
make
fat
out
of
carbohydrates
if
it
needs
them
third
your
body
like
most
peoples
wasnt
bred
to
live
on
a
high
fat
modern
diet
if
you
read
texts
about
ancient
and
primative
people
you
will
read
about
the
luxury
of
eating
fat
how
people
enjoyed
it
this
was
because
it
was
so
rare
even
cows
didnt
put
out
nearly
the
amount
of
butterfat
in
milk
that
they
do
now
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calories
up
slowly
rather
than
bread
or
corn
maybe
smaller
meals
as
you
may
be
getting
less
room
in
the
stomach
area
is
the
baby
still
coming
up
is
it
starting
to
push
or
rub
under
your
ribs
how
tight
are
your
clothes
you
shouldnt
be
wearing
any
clothing
that
compresses
your
middle
be
sure
not
to
suck
in
your
stomach
when
sitting
again
it
will
put
pressure
on
the
digestive
tract
try
laying
on
your
sides
back
and
stay
in
reclining
positions
for
the
many
hours
you
are
being
inactive
easier
on
your
legs
circulation
as
well
you
might
try
letting
the
baby
turn
or
at
least
not
be
forced
under
the
ribs
during
the
last
months
when
you
are
shortwaisted
its
easy
for
that
baby
to
end
up
right
under
the
diaphram
especially
if
you
have
tight
abdominal
muscles
if
i
had
my
second
one
to
do
over
again
i
think
id
have
tried
to
loosen
up
since
he
didnt
turn
sideways
until
late
and
the
relief
was
enormous
maybe
this
doctor
does
have
a
thing
about
weight
gain
in
pregnancy
or
maybe
she
just
nags
all
her
patients
this
way
especially
if
shes
young
but
this
gallbladderwhatever
problem
that
might
be
coming
up
is
something
to
be
avoided
if
possible
you
dont
want
to
become
ill
with
it
while
you
are
pregnant
if
you
are
lucky
you
can
work
on
getting
rid
of
it
after
the
baby
it
is
said
that
doctors
have
less
gallbadder
surgery
than
the
rest
of
the
population
a
good
part
of
it
is
that
they
are
willing
to
do
the
dieting
etc
that
helps
them
avoid
surgery
also
i
dont
think
the
surgery
lets
a
person
go
back
to
eating
a
high
fat
diet
nausea
etc
can
vary
from
person
to
person
and
with
each
pregnancy
my
first
pregnancy
was
miserable
during
the
second
i
had
very
little
trouble
some
articles
have
said
that
women
with
nausea
had
a
statistically
better
chance
of
carrying
their
baby
grain
of
salt

kiran

you
have
a
good
point

in

and
in
the
coating
on
barbecue
potato

nacho

doritos
breading
for
many
frozen
fried
foods
like
fish
and
chicken
etc
ad
naseum
if
msg
is
really
the
problem
we
should
call
this
barbecue
potato
chip
syndrome
or
maybe
diner
syndrome
or
the
and
other
natural
flavorings
syndrome
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
bought
anything
labelled
with
and
other
natural
flavorings
from
kiranvillagecom
kiran
wagle
the
reaction
came
the
time
the
msg
was
in
the
food
that
was
the
only
difference
same
restaurant
same
ingredients
how
do
you
know
this
in
order
to
demonstrate
your
claim
you
would
have
had
to
supervise
the
preparation
on
both
occasions
perhaps
they
used
msg
both
times
and
lied
about
it
perhaps
once
they
used
something
that
had
begun
to
spoil
and
produced
some
bizarre
toxin
that
youre
allergic
to
well
i
had
had
similar
reactions
many
times
that
was
when
i
really
started
watching
carefully
reaction
to
doritos
hey
guess
whats
in
there
reaction
to
lawrys
season
salt
guess
whats
in
there
ill
give
you
a
hint
ive
had
enough
problems
with
many
many
many
different
products
with
msg
that
i
figured
out
one
thing
unless
i
plan
on
getting
sick
i
wont
eat
the
stuff
without
my
seldane
and
did
i
ever
learn
to
read
labels
please
note
that
i
am
not
saying
you
are
making
it
up
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
that
the
situation
is
not
always
as
simple
as
it
might
seem
which
was
why
i
started
checking
every
time
i
got
sick
and
every
time
i
got
sick
msg
was
somehow
involved
in
one
of
the
food
products
and
consider
there
were
no
other
similar
ingredients
to
my
knowledge
it
might
not
please
a
medical
researcher
but
it
pleased
my
own
personal
physician
enough
for
him
to
give
me
allergy
medicine
and
most
importantly
its
enough
proof
for
me
to
avoid
it
and
enough
proof
that
my
incredibly
frugal
fiance
didnt
flinch
when
i
literally
threw
out
or
gave
away
all
the
food
products
in
his
pantry
that
had
msg
and
he
always
flinches
when
theres
waste
but
it
was
a
simple
explanation
i
wont
eat
this
stuff
i
wont
cook
with
this
stuff
so
i
can
either
throw
it
out
or
give
it
away
from
patteeucsucoloradoedu
donna
pattee
my
guess
was
that
the
spice
mix
on
the
fries
contained
msg
probably
lawrys
seasoning
salt
i
love
the
way
that
tastes
im
not
saying
i
never
consume
anything
with
msg
ive
noticed
that
i
have
a
certain
tolerance
level
like
a
small
bag
of
bbq
chips
once
a
month
or
so
it
not
a
problem
but
that
same
bag
of
chips
will
bother
me
if
i
also
had
chicken
bouillon
yesterday
and
lunch
at
one
of
the
chinese
restaurants
the
day
before
from
kelleyhealthyuwaterlooca
catherine
l
kelley
all
thats
needed
now
is
that
final
step
a
doubleblind
study
done
on
humans
there
isnt
even
an
ethical
question
about
possible
harm
as
this
is
a
widely
used
and
approved
food
additive
but
some
say
that
only
of
the
population
has
a
problem
with
msg
some
say
its
more
like
but
lets
say
that
its
how
many
people
would
have
to
be
tested
that
would
have
a
problem
also
i
know
i
have
a
problem
with
it
and
i
wouldnt
volunteer
for
a
test
like
thanks
guys
but
i
dont
want
to
get
sick
also
im
sure
that
most
people
probably
have
varying
degrees
of
sensitivities
at
different
times
if
i
have
a
cold
im
much
more
susceptible
to
the
reaction
than
when
im
healthy
as
proven
today
when
im
stuffy
but
for
some
silly
reason
i
still
gave
in
and
decided
to
have
the
bbq
chips
from
kiranvillagecom

wagle
because
too
many
of
you
generic
rhetorical
you

the

you
complain
to

you

this

is

more

i
suggested

cathy
doesnt
i
havent

all
my

but
i
never
called

chinese

and
i
never
stated
i
got
it
only
from
chinese
food
i
just
thought
it
would
be
easiest
to
conduct
my
personal
test
at
a
chinese
take
out
place
that
i
knew
would
hold
or
not
hold
the

i
cant
call
up
whoever
makes
doritos
and
ask
them
to
make
me
one
back
of
chips
without
msg
on
the
other
hand
if
one
complains
about
potatoes
from
a
mix
or
restaurant
spice
mixes
im
going
to
believe
them
and
if
anyone
says
they
got
msgsick
after
eating
too
many
barbecue
potato
chips
at
a
party
im
really
going

believe

annual
inguinal
hernia
repair
last
year
i
was
totally
surprised
when
my
annual
physical
disclosed
an
inguinal
hernia
i
couldnt
remember
doing
anything
that
would
have
caused
it
that
is
i
hadnt
been
lifting
more
than
other
people
do
and
in
fact
probably
somewhat
less
eventually
the
thing
became
more
painful
and
i
had
the
repair
operation
this
year
i
developed
a
pain
on
the
other
side
this
turned
out
to
be
another
inguinal
hernia
so
i
go
back
to
the
hospital
monday
for
another
fun
operation
i
dont
know
of
anything
im
doing
to
cause
this
to
happen
im
years
old
and
i
dont
think
im
old
enough
for
things
to
start
falling
apart
like
this
the
surgeon
who
is
doing
the
operation
seems
to
suspect
a
congenital
weakness
but
if
so
why
did
it
suddenly
appear
when
i
was
and
not
really
as
active
as
i
was
when
i
was
younger
does
anyone
know
how
to
prevent
a
hernia
other
than
not
lifting
anything
its
rare
that
i
lift
more
than
my
or
a
sack
full
of
groceries
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
your
typical
grocery
sack
is
fairly
small
these

is
there
some

a

earnings
is
right
up
there
it
almost
scored
a
perfect
braindead
it
was
commissioned
by
some
whiny
consumers
group
called
families
usa
the
poll
tells
us
that
the
majority
of
americans
believe
that
doctors
make
too
much
money
the
pollsters
also
asked
what
a
fair
income
would
be
for
physicians
those
polled
said
oh
about
a
year
would
be
ok
how
generous
how
sporting
how
stupid
why
is
this
poll
stupid
because
it
is
based
on
resentment
and
envy
two
emotions
that
ran
hot
during
the
political
campaign
and
are
still
simmering
you
could
conduct
the
same
kind
of
poll
about
any
group
that
earns
and
get
the
same
results
since
the
majority
of
americans
dont
make
those
bucks
they
assume
that
those

because
it
didnt

questions
such
as
do
you
know
how
much
education
and
training
it
takes
to
become
a
physician
if
those
polled
said
no
they
didnt
know
then
they
should
have
been
disqualified
if
they
gave
the
wrong
answers
they
should
have

dropped
what
good
are
their
views
on
how
much
a
doctor
should
earn
if
they
dont
know
what
it
takes
to
become
a
doctor
or
maybe
a
question
should
have
been
phrased
this
way
how
much
should
a
person
earn
if
he
or
she
must
a
get
excellent
grades
and
a
fine
educational
foundation
in
high
school
in

to
b
be
accepted
by
a
good
college
and
spend
four
years
taking
courses
heavy
in
math
physics
chemistry
and
other
lab
work
and
maintain
a
average
or
better
and
c
spend
four
more
years

grinding
study
in
medical
school
with
the
third
and
fourth

in
clinical
training
working
to
hours
a

spend

as
a

hardwork
intern
and
e
put
in
another
three

of

training
depending
on
your
specialty
and
f
maybe
wind
up
in
debt
after
medical

and
g
then
work
an
average
of
hours
a
week
with
many
family
doctors
putting
in
hours
or
more
until
they
retire
or
fall
over
as
you
have
probably
guessed
by
now
i
have
considerably
more
respect
for
doctors
than
does
the
law
firm
of
clinton
and
clinton
and
all
the
lawyers
and
insurance
executives
they
have
called
together
to
remake
americas
health
care
based
on
what
doctors
contribute
to
society
they
are
far
more
useful
than
the
powerhappy
egotripping
programspewing
social
tinkerers
who
will
probably
give
us
a
medical
plan
that
is
to
health
what
clintons
first
budget
is
to
frugality
but
propaganda
works
and
as
the
stupid
poll
indicates
many
americans
wrongly
believe
that
profiteering
doctors
are
the
major
cause
of
high
medical
costs
of
course
doctors
are
wellcompensated
they
should
be
americans

who

ah
that
is
not
something
you
heard
president
clinton

super
spouse
talk
about
during
the
campaign
or
since
but
instead
of
trying
to
turn
the
medical
profession
into
a
villain
they
might
have
been
more
honest
if
they
had
said
let
us
talk
about
medical
care
and
one
of
the
biggest
problems
we
have
that
problem
is
you
my

yes
you
eating

eating

many

you
guzzling
too

hooch
still
puffing
away
at

getting
your

lumbering
from

doing

bringing

babies
into

filling
the
big
city
emergency

with
gunshot
victims
engaging
in
unsafe
sex
and
catching
a
deadly
disease
while
blaming
the
world
for
not
finding
an
instant
cure
you
and
your
habits
not
the
doctors
are
the
single
biggest
health
problem
in
this
country
if
anything
it
is
amazing
that
the
docs
keep
you
alive
as
long
as
they
do
in
fact
i
dont
understand
how
they
can
stand
looking
at
your
blubbery
bods
all
day
so
as
your

i
call
upon
you
to
stop
whining

start

cleanly
now
i
must
go
get
myself
a

cheesy

do
as
i
say
not
as
i
do
but
for
those
who
truly
believe
that
doctors
are
overpaid
there
is
another
solution
dont
use
them
thats
right
you
dont
feel
well
then
try
one
of
those
spine
poppers
needle
twirlers
or
have
rev
bubba
lay
his
hands
upon
your
head
and
declare
you
fit
or
there
is
the

approach
you
have

pains
then
sit
in

of
a
mirror
make
a
slit

a

pop
in
a

youre
going

why
throw
your

overpaid
sawbones
so
he
can
buy
a
better

a
bigger
house
than
you
will
ever
have
while
paying
more
in
taxes
and
malpractice
insurance
than
you
will
ever
earn
just
have
the

the

squat
and
do

and
if
it

you
can
go

i
was
somewhat
disappointed
to
find
out
that
you
have

forever
is
that
right
you
might
look
for
an
allergy
doctor
in
your
area
who
uses
sublingual
drops
instead
of
shots
for
treatment
you
are
given
a
small
bottle
of
antigens
drops
are
placed
under
the

for

my
allergy
to
bermuda
grass
was
neutralized
this
way
throughout
the
treatment
process
i
had
to
return
to
the
doctors
office
every
month
for
retesting
and
a
new
bottle
of
antigens
after
the
allergy
was
completely
neutralized
a
bottle
of
maintenance
antigens
lasts
me
about
months
the
sublingual
drops
are
then
taken
times
per
week
and
costs
so
the
cost
is
less
than
shots
and
it
is
more

anesthetic

can

the

cannot
clear
the

out

as
easily
in
addition
medications

interactions

can

i
also
had

i
can

what
i
can
find
i
can
tell
you
that
haldol
is
an
antipsychotic
drug
and
according
to
the
drug
handbook
it
is
especially
useful
for
agitation
associated

senile
dementia
p
it
also
should
not

abruptly
it
did
not

adults
the
change
in
environment
can
cause
problems
anesthetic
agents
can
cause
confusion
because
the
body
cannot
clear
the
medicines
out
of
the
body
as
easily
the
original
poster
did
not
say
why
his
mother
had
been
in
hospital
but
i
can
answer
a
few
general
points
elderly
patients
may
exhibit
a
marked
difficulty
in
coping
after
being
in
hospital
for
a
few
days
the
drastic
change
of
environment
will
often
unmask
how
marginally
they
have
been
coping
at
home
even
young
people
find
the
change
unsettling
though
we
have
thought
that
this
decrement
in
function
after
say
anaesthesia
and
surgery
for
a
fractured
hip
a
common
event
in
the
elderly
was
due
to
anaesthesia
there
is
good
evidence
that
the
change
of
situation
is
much
more
important
some
hospitals
have
tried
a
rapid
transit
system
for
hip
fractures
aiming
to
have
the
patient
back
at
home
within
hours
of
admission
the
selection
of
the
anaesthetic
has
no
effect
on
the
ability
to
discharge
these
patients
early
anaesthetists
who
work
with
the
elderly
which
is
almost
all
of
us
generally
take
care
to
tailor
the
choice
and
dose
of
drugs
used
to
the
individual
patient
even
so
there
is
some
evidence
that
full
mental
recovery
may
take
a
surprisingly
long
time
to
return
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
is
detected
by
setting
quite
difficult
tasks
not
the
gross
change
that
the
original
poster
noted
haloperidol
haldol
tm
is
a
long
acting
drug
the
plasma
half
life
of
the
drug
is
up
to
hours
if
the
decanoate
a
sort
of
slow
release
formulation
is
used
it
may
be
weeks
the
elderly
are
sensitive
to
haloperidol
for
a
number
of
reasons
without
knowing
more
it
is
hard
to
comment
don
mackie
his
opinions
esiology
will
disavow
subject
re
use
of
haldol
in
elderly
ive
seen
people
in
their
forties
and
fifties
become
disoriented
and
demented
during
hospital
stays
in
the
examples
ive
seen
drugs
were
definitely
involved
my
own
father
turned
into
a
vegetable
for
a
short
time
while
in
the
hospital
he
was
fiftythree
at
the
time
and
he
was
on
separate
medications
the
family
protested
but
the
doctors
were
adamant
telling
us
that
none
of
the
drugs
interact
they
even
took
the
attitude
that
if
he
was
disoriented
they
should
put
him
on
something
else
as
well
with
the
help
of
an
md
friend
of
the
family
we
had
all
his
medication
discontinued
he
had
a
seizure
that
night
and
was
put
back
on
one
drug
two
days
later
he
was
his
old
self
again
i
guess
there
arent
many
medical
texts
that
address
the
subject
of
interactions
i
dont
mean
this
as
a
cheap
shot
at
the
medical
profession
it
is
an
aspect
of
hospitals
that
is
very
frightening
to
me
docs
seem
to
believe
that
because
they
have
close
control
of
you
its
quite
all
right
to
take
your
bodily
equilibria
into
their
own
hands
that
control
reduces
the
chance
that
the
patient
will
make
a
mistake
but
health
care
providers
can
make
mistakes
too
and
mistakes
can
be
deadly
under
those
circumstances
i
grant
you
that
sometimes
theres
no
choice
nevertheless
i
suggest
you
procure
a
list
of
the
drugs
your
grandmother
is
getting
and
discuss
it
with
an
independent
doc
her
problems
may
not
be
the
effect
of
haldol
at
all
haldol
may
have
been
used
validly
or
it
may
have
been
prescribed
because
other
medication
confused
her
and
because
the

it

they

editorial
note
the
cesarean
rate
in
the
united
states
steadily
increased
from
through
however
the
findings
in
this
report
indicate
that
rates
have
been
stable
since
because
there
is
little
evidence
that
maternal
and
child
health
status
has
improved
during
this
time
and
because
cesareans
are
associated
with
an
increased
risk
for
complications
of
childbirth
a
national
health
objective
for
the
year
is
to
reduce
the
overall
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
and
the
primary
cesarean
rate
to
or
fewer
per
deliveries
objective
postpartum
complications
including
urinary
tract
and
wound
infections
may
account
in
part
for
the
longer
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
than
for
vaginal
births
moreover
the
prolonged
hospital
stays
for
cesarean
deliveries
substantially
increase
healthcare
costs
for
example
in
the
average
costs
for
cesarean
and
vaginal
deliveries
were
and
respectively
the
additional
cost
for
each
cesarean
delivery
includes
for
physician
fees
and
for
hospital
charges
if
the
cesarean
rate
in
had
been
the
year
objective
instead
of
the
number
of
cesarean
births
would
have
decreased
by
versus
resulting
in
a
savings
of
more
than
billion
in
physician
fees
and
hospital
charges
despite
the
steady
increase
in
vbac
rates
since
several
factors
may
impede
progress
toward
the
year
national
health
objectives
for
cesarean
delivery
for
example
vbac
rates
substantially
reflect
the
number
of
women
offered
trial
of
labor
which
has
been
increasingly
encouraged
since
of
women
who
are
offered
a
trial
of
labor
could
deliver
vaginally
a
level
already
achieved
by
many
hospitals
trial
of
labor
was
routinely
offered
in
of
hospitals
surveyed
in
the
most
recent
year
for
which
hicnet

national

the

rate
of
based
on
all
women
who
had
a
prior
cesarean
regardless
of
whether
a
trial
of
labor
was
attempted
to
reach
the
overall
cesarean
rate
goal
however
increases
in
the
vbac
rate
will
need
to
be
combined
with
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
primary
rate
one
hospital
succeeded
in
reducing
the
rate
of
cesarean
delivery
by
applying
objective
criteria
for
the
four
most
common
indications
for
cesarean
delivery
by
requiring
a
second
opinion
and
by
instituting
a
peerreview
process
other
recommendations
for
decreasing
cesarean
delivery
rates
include
eliminating
incentives
for
physicians

apr
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
malaria
in
africa
has
become
a
challenging
and
complex
problem
because
of
increasing

although
the
risk
of
acquiring
malaria
for

editorial
note
in
uganda
the
increase
in
malaria
among
us
personnel
was
attributed
to
poor
adherence
to
both
recommended
malaria
chemoprophylaxis
regimens
and
use
of
personal
protection
measures
during
a
period
of
increased
malaria
transmission
and
intensified
chloroquine
resistance
in
subsaharan
africa
the
findings
in
this
report
underscore
the
need
to
provide
initial
and
continued
counseling
regarding
malaria
prevention
for
persons
living
abroad
in
malariaendemic
areas
preventive
measures
that
are
also
important
for
shortterm
travelers
to
such
areas
mefloquine
is
an
effective
prophylaxis
regimen
in
africa
and
in
most
other
areas
with
chloroquineresistant
p
falciparum
however
in
some
areas
eg
thailand
resistance
to
mefloquine
may
limit
its
effectiveness
in
africa
the
efficacy
of
mefloquine
compared
with
chloroquine
alone
in
preventing
infection
with
p
falciparum
is
mefloquine
is
safe
and
well
tolerated
when
given
at
mg
per
week
over
a
period
the
risk
for
serious
adverse
reactions
possibly
associated
with
mefloquine
prophylaxis
eg
psychosis
and
convulsions
is
low
ie
episodes
per
users
while
the
risk
for
less
severe
adverse
reactions
eg
dizziness
gastrointestinal
complaints
and
sleep
disturbances
is
similar
to
that
for
other
antimalarial
chemoprophylactics
doxycycline
has
similar
prophylactic
efficacy
to
mefloquine
but
the
need
for
daily
dosing
may
reduce
compliance
with
and
effectiveness
of
this
regimen
chloroquine
alone
is
not
effective
as
prophylaxis
in
areas
of
intense
chloroquine
resistance
eg
southeast
asia
and
africa
in
africa
for
persons
who
cannot
take
mefloquine
or
doxycycline
chloroquine
and
proguanil
is
an
alternative
although
less
effective
regimen
chloroquine
should
be
used
for
malaria
prevention
in
areas
only

to

illnesses
such
as

who
are
suffering
the
most
serious

to
get
access
to

months
or
even

earlier

said
hhs
secretary
louis

the
effort
to
accelerate
fda
review
for
these
drugs
has
been
a
longterm
commitment
and
indeed
a
hallmark
of
this
administration
these
rules
establish
procedures
for
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
approve
a
drug
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
or
markers
they
apply
when
the
drug
provides
a
meaningful
benefit
over
currently
available
therapies
such
endpoints
would
include
laboratory
tests
or
physical
signs
that
do
not
in
themselves
constitute
a
clinical
effect
but
that
are
judged
by
qualified
scientists
to
be
likely
to
correspond
to
real
benefits
to
the
patient
use
of
surrogate
endpoints
for
measurement
of
drug
efficacy
permits
approval
earlier
than
if
traditional
endpoints
such
as
relief
of
disease
symptoms
or
prevention
of
disability
and
death
from
the
disease
are
used
the
new
rules
provide
for
therapies
to
be
approved
as
soon
as
safety
and
effectiveness
based
on
surrogate
endpoints
can
be
reasonably
established
the
drugs
sponsor
will
be
required
to
agree
to
continue
or
conduct
postmarketing
human
studies
to
confirm
that
the
drugs
effect
on
the
surrogate
endpoint
is
an
indicator
of
its
clinical
effectiveness

for
the

can
be

have
the
baseline
diet
almost
free
of
the
variables
you
are
going
to
put
into
the
experimental
diet
the
framingham
study
for
example
did
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
diet
between
individuals
who
got
heart
disease
because
the
diet
was
already
high
in
fat
all
subjects
were
already
eating
on
a
plateau
dr
connor
says
after
weeks
of
consuming
the
affluent
diet
the
subjects
mean
plasma
cholesterol
levels
had
in
creased
by
percent
primarily
in
the
ldl
fraction
which
rose
percent
hdlcholesterol
increased
by
per
cent
and
ldl
to
hdl
ratios
changed
therefore
very
little
plasma
triglyceride
levels
increased
by
percent
and
subjects
averaged
an
gain
in
weight
according
to
dr
connor
lipid
changes
occurred
surprisingly
soon
yielding
nearly
the
same
results
after

of

the
increase
in
hdl
carries
broad
dietary
implications
for
industrialized
nations
we
think
hdlcholesterol
increased
because
we
increased
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
over
the
fat
content
used
in
the
previous
tarahumara
metabolic
study
in
that
study
we
saw
no
change
in
hdl
levels
after
raising
the
dietary
cholesterol
but
keeping
the
fat
relatively
consistent
with
native
consumption
in
the
present
study
we
increased
fat
intake
to
percent
of
the
total
calories
we
reached
the
conclusion
in
the
tarahumara
study
that
hdl
reflects
the
amount
of
dietary
fat
in
general
and
not
the
amount
of
dietary
cholesterol
hdl
must
increase
to
help
metabolize
the
fat
and
it
increased
quite
a
bit
in
this
study
dr
connor
explains
low
hdl
in
the
tarahumarans
is
not
typically
an
important
predictor
of
coronary
heart
disease
because
they
do
not
normally
consume
large
amounts
of
fat
or
cholesterol
hdl
remains
an
important
predictor
to
americans
because
of
their
usual
high
fat
intake
dr
connor
recommends
a
diet
for
americans
that
contains
less
than
percent
of
total
calories
as
fat
less
than
mg
of
cholesterol
and
a
csi
around
varying
in
accordance
with
caloric
needs
such
a
diet
is
low
in
meat
and
dairy
fat
high
in
fiber
dr
connor
also
comments
on
recent
suggestions
that
americans
adopt
a
mediterraneanstyle
diet
the
original
mediterranean
diet
in
its
pristine
state
consisted
of
a
very
low
intake
of
fat
and
very
few
animal
and
dairy
products
we
are
already
eating
a
lot
of
meat
and
dairy
products
simply
to
continue
that
pattern
while
switching
to
olive
oil
is
not
going
to
help
the
situation
the
world
health
organization
who
is
focusing
much
attention
on
the
emergence
of
diseases
such
as
coronary
heart
disease
in
nations
and
societies
undergoing
technological
development
dr
connor
says
that
coronary
heart
disease
starts
with
a
given
societys
elite
who
typically
eat
a
different
diet
than
the
average
citizen
if
the
pattern
of
afluence
increases
the
entire
population
will
have
have
a
higher
incidence
of
coronary
heart
disease
which
places
a
termendous
health
care
burden
on
a
society
who
would
like
the
developing
countries
to
prevent
coronary
heart
disease
so
they
can
concentrate
on
other
aspects
of
their
economic
development
and
on
public
health
measures
to
improve
general
wellbeing
rather
than
paying
for
unnecessary
expensive
medical
technology
dr
connors
says
the
overall
implication
of
this
study
is
that
humans
can
readily
move
their
plasma
lipids
and
lipoprotein
values
into
a
highrisk
range
within
a
very
short
time
by
an
affluent
excessive
diet
the
present
rate
of
coronary
heart
disease
in
the
united
states
is
percent
less
than
it
was
years
ago
so
a
lot
has
been
accomplished
we
are

testing
living
patients
with
newly

were

was
performed

genetic
relatedness
of

to
that
of
the
dentist
death
certificates
were
obtained
for

the
medical
records

those
with
diagnoses
suggestive
of
hiv

and
those
dying

in

there

an

identified
five

all

were
either
homosexuals

the

were
able

hiv

four

evidence
of

factors
for
the
disease
one
patient

highrisk
behavior
comparative
dna
sequence
analysis
showed
that
the
viruses
from
the
dentists
and
these
five
patients
were
not

the
study
suggests
the
potential
for
hiv

tuberculosis

strike

patients
more

hazard

according
to
a
study
published

people
who
contract

usually
develop
an
immunity
that
protects
them
if
they
are
exposed

a

because
it

dr
edward

arranged
the

he
said
that
cooperation
between

seemed
increasingly
significant
as
it
had
become
clear
that
combinations
of
drugs
were
likely
to
be
more
effective
in
fighting
hiv
than
any
drug
used
alone
the
researchers
are
hopeful
that
hiv
when
faced
with
a
combination
of
several
drugs
requiring
mutation
at
different
sites
for
resistance
to
develop
will
be
unable
to
evolve
all
the
mutations
at
the
same
time
therefore
several
drugs
taken
together
or
one
after
the
other
could
halt

basis
that

appeared

a
report
in

demonstrated
that
azt
should

used
early
in
the
course
of

while
the
counts
of
the
people
given
azt
were
consistently
greater

those
of
patients
receiving
only

the
first
three
years
of

have
shown
that
the
proportions
of
people
in
the
two
groups
progressing
to
overt
aids
or
even
to
death
were
not
significantly
different
at
roughly
percent
the
conclusions
are
that
azt
is
not
an
effective
aids
drug
in
hivinfected
individuals
and
that
cell
count
may
not
be
a
reliable
proxy
for
the
progression
to
aids
in
infected
people
but
nothing
is
implied
by
the
study
of
the
utility
of
azt
in
the
treatment
of
those
in
whom
symptoms

already
appearedthere
is
no
case
for
abandoning
that
treatment
at

on

now

it
is

that
the

proven

i

you

our

im
not

whether
you
got
the
information
on
rutin
or
not
rutin
is
not
a
herb
but
part
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
you
should
generally
not
take
rutin
by
itself
but
take
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
if
you
dont
and
there
are
some
exceptions
to
that
youll
eventually
create
a
hesperidin
deficiency
which
is
the
other
major
component
of
the
bioflavonoid
complex
i
found
out
the
hard
way
years
ago
when
i
recommended
rutin
after
it
showed
deficient
in
patients
who
were
not
deficient
in
hesperidin
be
fore
a
later
retest
almost
always
showed
a
subsequent
deficiency
in
hesperidin
which
from
then
on
made
me
always
add
bioflavonoids
to
anyone
that
had
very
low
levels
of
rutin
most
of
the
time
people
are
equally
low
in
rutin
and
hesperidin
so
there
is
really
no
reason
to
take
rutin
by
itself
but
use
the
whole
bioflavonoid
complex
instead
i
have
several

took

hemorrhoids

any
ill
effects

are
also
nontoxic
in

they
can
be

if

also
leads

the
loss
of
body
fat
will
be
equally
distributed

there
is
no

to
spot
reduce

fat
other
than
surgically
through

distribution
of

fat
is
genetically

sometimes
a

flabby
muscle
will
look
like
fat
so
when
that
muscle
gains
some
muscle
tone
it
may
appear
as
though
the

is

a

for
back

hello
just
one
quick
question
my
father
has
had
a
back
problem
for
a
long
time
and
doctors
have
diagnosed
an
operation
is
needed
since
he
lives
down
in
mexico
he
wants
to
know
if
there
is
a
hospital
anywhere
in
the
united
states
particulary
famous
for
this
kind
of
surgery
kind
of
like
houston
has
a
reputation
for
excellent
doctors
in
eye
surgery
any
additional
info
or
pointers
will
be
appreciated
a
whole
lot
thanks
in

i

my
previous
reply
on
this

which
it

been
pointed
out
to
me
might
have
been
dangerously
misleading
in
two
spots
i
stated
that
psychotherapy
meaning
talking
therapy
and
so
on
was
used
to
treat
obsessive
compulsive
disorder
which
though
sometimes
true
is
misleading
it
is
not
often
found
effective
particularly
by
itself
primary
treatment
today
usually
consists
at
least
in
part
of
drug
therapy
the
most
current
theories
of
this
condition
attribute
it
to
more
to
biological
causes
than
psychological
in
places
where
this
distinction
becomes
important
i
mentioned
that
the
dsmiiir
mentions
impulses
as
a
possible
diagnostic
marker
however
this
might
look
like
something
people
associate
with
psychotic
conditions
uncontrollable
or
unpredictable
behaviors
which
is
not
the
case
with
ocd
one
of
the
diagnostic
criteria
of
ocd
is
that
the
individual
can
and
does
suppress
some
of
their
impulses
although
they
are
an
unending
source
of
anxiety
the
obsessive
thoughts
and
ritualistic
actions
usually
associated
with
ocd
are
most
frequently
very
mundane
and
predictable
closer
to
a
superstitious

principle
underlying

a

external

are
experimental

the

of

and
similar
units
used

they

in
the

a

that

as
with
experimental
drugs
as
the

so
its

of
the

is
to
read
the

to
keep

changes

the
clamor
over

resulted
in

spending
quite
a

that

a

who
continued

more

treatments

may
deserve

antifungals
are
in

the
big
question
seems

is
it
reasonable
to
use
them
in
patients
with
gi
distress

sinus
problems
that
could
be
due

following
the

gorden
rubenfeld
through
email
has
assured
me
that
most
physicians
recognize
the
chance
of
candida
blooms
occuring
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
and
they
therefore
reinnoculate
their
patients
with
good
bacteria
to
restore
competetion
for
candida
in
the
body
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
yet
a
standard
part
of
medical
practice
he
deals
with
critical
care
patients
where
fungal
infectionsystemic
is
a
real
problem
and
just
because
he
tries
to
keep
good
bacteria
in
his
patients
does
not
mean
that
all
physicians
do
this
i
think
that
aspergillis
is
more
likely
to
be
found
in
the
sinus
mucus
membranes
than
is
candida
women
have
been
known
for
a
very
long
time
to
suffer
from
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
and
a
women
is
lucky
to
find
a
physician
who
is
willing
to
treat
the
cause
and
not
give
give
her
advise
to
use
the
otc
antifungal
creams
since
candida
colonizes
primarily
in
the
anorectal
area
gi
symptoms
should
be
more
common
than
vaginal
problems
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
the
problem
we
have
here
david
is
proof
that
gi
discomfort
can
be
caused
by
a
candida
bloom
the
arguement
is
that
without
proof
no
action
is
warrented
medicine
has
not
and
probalby
never
will
be
practiced
this
way
there
has

very
good
example
is
kidney
stones
conventional
wisdombecause
clinical
trails
have
not

to
come
up
with
an

prevention
was
that
restricitng
the
intake

calcium
and
oxalates
was
the
best
way
to
prevent
kidney
stones
from
forming
clinical
trials
focused
on
drugs
or
ultrasonic
blasts
to
breakdown
the
stone
once
it
formed
through
the
recent
new
england
j
of

article
we
now
know
that
conventional
wisdom
was
wrong
increasing
calcium
intake
is
better
at
preventing
stone
formation
than
is
restricting
calcium
intake
the
conventional

what

that

aids
which
keep
me
roughly
functional
but
leave
a

to
be
desired
recently
i
had
an
opportunity
to
test
the
widex
behind
the
ear
aids
for
several
weeks
these
have
four
independent
programs
which
are
intended
to
be
customized
for
different
hearing
situations
and
can
be
reprogramed
i
found
them
to
be
a
definite
improvement
over
my
current
aids
and
was
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
another
local
outfit
advertised
a
free
trial
of
another
programmable
system
called
resound
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
try
the
resound
aids
in
their
office
for
about
minutes
and
i
couldnt
compare
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
was
able
to
read
about
the
theory
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separate
posting
they
also
carry
the

and
had
one
patient
presumably
wealthy
who
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchased
the
widex
only
months
ago
the
problem
is
that
the
resound
aids
are
about
twice
as
expensive
as
the
widex
and
other
programmable
aids
i
could
take
a
trip

resound
hearing
aid
theory
as
i
understand
it
the
following
is
based
on
copies
i
was
given
of
some
articles
published
in
hearing
instruments
i
would
appreciate
any
comments
about
this
and
other
new
technology
for
hearing
aids
the
resound
system
was
developed
on
the
basis
of
some
research
at
att
and
appears
to
take
a
different
approach
from
other
aids
it
appears
to
me
that
a
new
programmable
aid
like
the
widex
just
uses
a
more
flexible
and
programmable
version
of
the
classical
approach
of
amplifying
some
parts
of
the
spectrum
more
than
others
and
adding
some
compression
to
try
and
help
out
in
noisy
situations
the
major
difference
in
the
resound
approach
is
that
it
divides
the
spectrum
into
low
and
high
frequencies
splitting
point
is
programmable
apparently
based
on
the
fact
that
lots
of
vowel
information
can
be
found
in
the
low
frequencies
while
the
important
consonant
information
unfortunately
for
me
is
in
the
high
frequencies
the
two
bands
then
are
treated
with
different
compression
schemes
which
are
programable
they
have
also
developed
a
new
fitting
algorythm
that
builds
on
what
they
call
abnormal
growth
of
loudness
this
latter
is
interesting
and
fits
my
own
personal
experience
though
i
think
the
phrase
is
missleading
what
appears
to
be
the
case
is
that
as
you
exceed
the
minimum
threshold
for
a
person
with
hearing
loss
the
deficit
becomes
progresslively
less

following
the
use
of
broadspectrum
antibiotics
gorden
rubenfeld
through
email
has
assured
me
that
most
physicians
recognize
the
chance
of
candida
blooms
occuring
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
and
they
therefore
reinnoculate
their
patients
with
good
bacteria
to
restore
competetion
for
candida
in
the
body
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
yet
a
standard
part
of
medical
practice
nor
is
it
mine
what
i
tried
to
explain
to
marty
was
that
it
is
clearly
understood
that
antibiotic
exposure
is
a
risk
factor
for
fungal
infections
which
is
not
the
same
as
saying
bacteria
prevent
fungal
infections
marty
made
this
sound
like
a
secret
known
only
to
veternarians
and
biochemists
anyone
who
has
treated
a
urinary
tract
infection
knowns
this
at
some
centers
preop
liver
transplant
patients
receive
bowel
decontamination
directed
at
retaining
good
anaerobic
flora
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
fungal
colonization
in
this
soontobe
high
risk
group
i
also
use
lactobacillus
to
treat
enteral
nutrition
associated
diarrhea
that
may
be
in
part
due
to
alterations
in
gut
flora
however
it
is
not
part
of
my
routine
practice
to
reinnoculate
patients
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotics
i
have
seen
no
data
on
this
practice
preventing
or
treating
fungal
infections
in
at
risk
patients
whether
or
not
it
is
a
logical
extension
from
the
available
observations
ill
leave
to
those
of
you
who
base
strong
opinions
and
argue
over
such
speculations
in
the
absence
of
clinical
trials
one
place
such
therapy
has
been
described
is
in
treating
particularly
recalcitrant
cases
of
c
difficile
colitis
not
a
fungal
infection
there
are
case
reports
of
using

ie
someone
elses

to
repopulate
the
patients
flora
dont
try
this
at
home
not
give
give
her
advise
to
use
the
otc
antifungal
creams
since
candida
colonizes
primarily
in
the
anorectal
area
gi
symptoms
should
be
more
common
than
vaginal
problems
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
except
that
it
isnt
at
least
symptomatically
apparent
disease
medicine
has
not
and
probalby
never
will
be
practiced
this
way
there
has
always
been
the
use
of
conventional
wisdom
a
very
good
example
is
kidney
stones
conventional
wisdombecause
clinical
trails
have
not
been
done
to
come
up
with
an
effective
prevention
was
that
restricitng
the
intake
of
calcium
and
oxalates
was
the
best
way
to
prevent
kidney
stones
from
forming
clinical
trials
focused
on
drugs
or
ultrasonic
blasts
to
breakdown
the
stone
once
it
formed
through
the
recent
new
england
j
of
medicine
article
we
now
know
that
conventional
wisdom
was
wrong
increasing
calcium
intake
is
better
at
preventing
stone
formation
than
is
restricting
calcium
intake
seems
like
this
is
an
excellent
argument
for
ignoring
anecdotal
conventional
wisdom
a
euphemism
for
no
data
and
doing
a
good
clinical
trial
like
au

the

p
less

but
nystatin
did
not
reduce
the
systemic
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
conclusions
in
women
with
presumed
candidiasis
hypersensitivity
syndrome
nystatin
does
not
reduce
systemic
or
psychological
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
consequently
the
empirical
recommendation
of
longterm
nystatin
therapy
for
such
women
appears
to
be
unwarranted
does
this
trial
address
every
issue
raised
here
no
jon
noring
was
not

at
this
negative
trial
since
they
didnt
use

despite

for
nystatin
maybe
they
didnt
avoid
those
carbohydrates
the
conventional
wisdom
in
animal
husbandry
has
been
that
animals
need
to
be
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
coming
off
antibiotic
therapy
if
it
makes
sense
for
livestock
why
doesnt
it
make

for
humans

pmscan
it
be
prevented
by
a

change
this
question
came
up
in
sci
med
nutrition
and
im
posting
my
answer
here
only
medical
schools
in
the
us
teach
courses
on
human
nutrition
we
have
already
seen
what
a
lack
of
nutrition
education
can
do
when
candida
and
kidney
stones
present
themselves
to
the
medical
community
i
think
that
the
best
example
of
where
us
medicine
is
really
missing
the
mark
when
it
comes
to
a
knowledge
of
nutrition
is
pms
so
many
womenand
their
husbands
suffer
from
this
disorder
that
it
is
really
criminal
that
most
physicians
in
the
us
are
not
taught
that
pms
is
primarily
caused
by
diet
and
diet
changes
can
prevent
it
from
ever
happpening
before
shooting
your
flames
read
the
entire
article
and
then
decide
if
flaming
is
justified
from
a
poster
in
sci
medi
nutrition
in
a
psychological
anthropology
course
i
am
taking
we
got
sidetracked
onto
a
short
conversation
about
pms
some
rumors
shared
by
several
of
the
students
included
ideas
that
vitamin
levels
sugar
intake
and
caffeine
intake
might
affect
pms
symptoms
is
there
any
data
on
this
or
is
it
just
so
much
hooey

that
magnesium
supplemenation
should
become
a
routine
treatment
for
the
mood
changes
that
occur
during
pms
there
are
numerous
observational
studies
that
have
been
published
in
the
medical
literature
which
also
suggest
that
pms
is
primarily
a
disorder
that
arises
out
of
a
hormone
imbalance
that
is
dietary
in
nature
but
since
observational
studies
are
considered
by
most
physicians
in
sci
med
to
be
anecdotal
in
nature
i
have
not
bothered
to
cite
them
there
are
also
over
a
half
dozen
good
experimental
studies
that
have
been
done
on
multivitamin
and
mineral
supplementation
to
prevent
pms
ive
chosen
the
best
specific
studies
on
individual
vitamins
and
minerals
to
try
to
point
out
that
pms
is
primarily
a
nutritional
disorder
but
doctors
dont
recognize
nutritional
disorders
unless
they
can

does
that

it

the

this

isnt
what

bacteria
in

is
primarily
responsible
for
keeping

most

much
more
important

gordon

he
gives
his

l
acidophilus
and
several
different
obligate
anaerobeswhich
setup

he
hasnt
told

which
ones
yet
the
lactobacillus

are
mostly
facultative
anaerobes

will

they
have

having
these

decrease
the
chance

i
have
not

action
for

i
know

that
all

im

yet
i
do
believe
that
complications

anal
and
maybe
lower
colon
sinus
and
mouth
can
result
from
antibiotic
use
which
removes
the
competing
bacteria
from
these
sites
and
thus
lets
candida
grow
unchecked
restoring
the
right
bacterial
balance
is
the
best
wayin
my
opinion
to
get
rid
of
the
problem
antifungals
a
low
carbohydrate
diet
and
vitamin
a
supplementation
may
all
help
to
minimize
the
local
irritation
until
the
good
bacteria
can
take
over
control
of

supply
again

lower

starve

they
therefore
reinnoculate

factor

is
not

as
saying

prevent

made
this
sound

that
may

however
it

not

to
reinnoculate

i
have
seen
no
data
on

preventing

treating

in

whether
or
not
it

ill

is
an

argument
for

a

the

significantly

both

p
less

but
nystatin
did
not
reduce
the
systemic

significantly
more
than
placebo
conclusions
in
women
with
presumed
candidiasis
hypersensitivity
syndrome
nystatin
does
not
reduce
systemic
or
psychological
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
consequently
the
empirical
recommendation
of
longterm
nystatin
therapy
for
such
women
appears
to
be
unwarranted
does
this
trial
address
every
issue
raised

no
jon
noring
was
not
surprised
at
this
negative

since
they
didnt
use

despite

recommendation
for
nystatin
maybe
they
didnt
avoid
those
carbohydrates
the
conventional
wisdom
in
animal
husbandry
has
been
that
animals
need
to
be
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
coming
off
antibiotic
therapy
if
it
makes
sense
for

why
doesnt
it

can
do
that
to
you
gordon
i
think
that
the
best
clinical
trial
for
candida
blooms
would
involve
giving
women
with
chronic
vaginal
candida
blooms
l
acidophilus
orally
and
see
it
it
can
decrease
the
frequency
and
extent
of
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
since
most
of
the
candida
seems
to
be
migrating
in
from
the
anal
region
and
l
acidophilus
should
be
able
keep
the
candida
in
check
if
it
can
make
it
through
the
intestinal
tract
and
colonize
in
the
anus
where
it
will
have
access
to
oxygenjust
like
it
does
in
the
vagina
as
much
stuff
as
there
is
in
the
lay
press
about
l
acidophilus
and
vaginal
yeast
infections
im
really
amazed
that
someone
has
not
done
a
clinical
trial
yet
to
check
it
out
the
calcium
and
kidney
stone
story
is
not
a
good
reason
to
throw
all
conventional
wisdom
out
the
window
where
would
medicine
be
if
conventional
wisdom
had
not
been
used
to
develop
many
of

standard

could

confirmed
through

the

is
a

a

one
the
lack
of
proof
that

to
the

is
no

they
need
because
workers
are
overworked
some
clients

amount
of

such
conditions
may
cause

to
become
more
frustrated
the
quality
of
the
clients
is
also
becoming
more
violent
as
more
are
moved
out

workers
have

under

im
lost
point
im
beginning
to
see
that
part
of
the
disagreements
about
the
whole
yeast
issue
is
on
differing
perceptions
and
on
differing
meanings
of
words
medical
doctors
have
a
very
specific
and
specialized
jargon
necessary
for
precise
communication
within
their
field
which
im
fully
cognizant
of
since
i
too
speak
jargonese
when
with
my
peers
for
the
situation
in
scimed
many
times
the
words
or
phrases
used
by
doctors
can
have
a
different
and
more
specific
meaning
than
the
same
word
used
in
the
world
at
large
causing
significant
miscommunication
one
example
word
and
very
relevant
to
the
yeast
discussion
is
the
exact
meaning
of
systemic
it
is
now
obvious
to
me
that
the
meaning
of
this
word
is
very
specific
much
more
so
than
its
meaning
to
a
nondoctor
there
is
also
the
observation
of
this
newsgroup
that
both
doctors
and
nondoctors
come
together
on
essentially
equal
terms
which
when
combined
with
the
jargon
issue
can
further
fan
the
flames
this
is
probably
the
first
time
that
practicing
doctors
get
really
beat
up
by
nondoctors
for
their
views
on
medicine
which
they
otherwise
dont
see
much
of
in
their
practice
except
for
the
occasional
difficult
patient
point
i
understand
the
viewpoint
among
many
practicing
doctors
that
they
will
not
prescribe
any
treatmentstherapies
for
their
patients
unless
such
treatments
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
and
the
risks
understood
from
wellconstructed
clinical
trials
usually
doubleblind
or
that
such
treatmentstherapies
are
part
of
an
approved
and
funded
clinical
trial
to
these
doctors
to
do
any
differently
would
in
this
belief
system
be
unethical
practice
and
it
follows
that
any
therapy
not
on
the
accepted
list
is
therefore
a
non
therapy
it
does
not
even
exist
nor
does
the
underlying
hypothesis
or
theory
have
any
validity
even
if
it
sounds
very
plausible
by
extrapolation
of
what
is
currently
known
anecdotal
evidence
has
no
value
either
from
a
treatment
pointofview
and
by
and
large
as
a
scientist
myself
i
am
glad
that
medical
practice
science
takes
such
a
rigorous
approach
to
medical
treatment
however
as
also
being
a
human
being
last
i
checked
and
having
been
one
of
those
people
that
has
been
significantly
helped
by
a
currently
unaccepted
treatment
where
standard
medicine
was
not
able
to
help
me
has
caused
me
to
sit
back
and
wonder
if
holding
such
an
extreme
and
rigid
scientific
viewpoint
is
in
itself
unethical
from
humanitarian
considerations
after
all
the
underlying
intent
of
the
scientific
approach
to
medicine
is
to
protect
the
health
of
the
patient
by
providing
the
best
possible
care
for
the
patient
so
the
patient
should
come
first
when
considering
treatment
what
we
need
is
a
slightly
modified
approach
to
treatment
that
satisfies
both
the
scientific
and
the
humanitarian
viewpoints
in
an
earlier
post
i
outlined
a
crazy
idea
for
doing
just
that
the
gist
of
it
was
to
give
any
physician
freedom
and
encouragement
by
the
medical
community
to
prescribe
alternate
not
yet
proven
therapies
maybe
supported
by
anecdotal
evidence
for
patients
who
all
avenues
of
accepted
therapies
have
been
exhausted
and
not
until
then
the
patient
would
be
fully
informed
that
such
therapiestreatments
are
not
supported
by
the
proper
clinical
trials
and
that
there
are
real
potential
risks
with
real
possibilities
of
no
benefit
derived
from
them
this
approach
satisfies
the
need
for
scientific
rigor
it
also
satisfies
the
humanitarian
needs
of
the
patient
and
the
reality
is
that
many
patients
who
have
reached
a
deadend
in
the
treatment
of
their
symptoms
using
accepted
medicine
will
go
outside
the
orthodox
medical
community
either
to
the
doctors
who
are
brave
enough
to
prescribe
such
treatments
at
the
risk
of
losing
their
license
or
worse
to
nondoctors
who
have
not
had
the
proper
medical
training
this
approach
also
recognizes
this
reality
and
keeps
the
control
more
within
orthodox
medicine
with
the
benefits
that
the
information
gleaned
could
help
focus
limited
resources
towards
future
clinical
trials
in
the
most
productive
way
everybody
wins
in
this
admittedly
rosecolored
approach
im
sure
there
are
real
problems
with
this
approach
as
well
it
is
presented
more
as
a
strawman
to
stimulate
discussion
hopefully
what
i
write
here
may
give
the
scimed
doctors
a
better
idea
as
to
why
i
am
open
to
alternative
therapies
as
well
as
why
i
have
real
difficulty
read
apparent
hostility
with
the
coldness
of
the
pure
scientific
approach
to
medicine
i
believe
the
best
approach
to
medical
treatment
is
one
where
both
the
humanitarian
aspects
are
balanced
with
and
by
the
scientific
aspects
anything
else

sounds
to
me
like
someone
was
pulling
your
leg
there
is
only
one
way
for
pregnancy
to
occur
intercourse
these
days
however
there
is
also
artificial
insemination
and
implantation
techniques
but
were
speaking
of
natural
acts
here
it
is
possible
for
pregnancy
to
occur
if
semen
is
deposited
just
outside
of
the
vagina
ie
coitus
interruptus
but
thats
about
at
far
as
you
can
get
through
clothes
no
way
better
go
talk
to
your
biology
teacher
what
is
the
likely
hood
of
conception
if
sperm
is
deposited
just
outside
the
vagina
ie
chance

really

why

this

with

said
dr

of
the

national
center
for
infectious

there
were
more
cases
of
malaria
in

in
than
in
any
year
since
the

latin
america
is
experiencing
a
cholera
epidemic
the
first
in
this

she
said
resistance
of
diseasecausing
agents
to
antibiotics
is
also
a
problem
we
are
seeing
much
more
antibiotic
resistance
than
we
have
in
the
past
berkleman
said
she
said
even
common
ear
infections
frequently
seen
in
children
are
becoming
resistant
to
antibiotic
treatment
despite
predictions
earlier
this

that
infectious

would
soon
be
eliminated
as

public

infectious
diseases
remain
the
major
cause
of
death
worldwide
and
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
united

the
cdc
said
it
cited
the
emergence
since
the
of
a

of
newly

pathogens
and
syndromes
such
as
escherichia

holding

for
not

enough
to

workers
from

is

as

study
on
the
disease
a
flulike
illness
that
can
cause
severe
physical
and
mental
disabilities
and
in
rare
instances
death
the
decision
last
week
has
put
property
owners
on
notice
that
they
may
have
to
do
more
than
protect
themselves
from
the
ticksthey
also
may
have

the
decision
by

district
judge
robert
j
ward
in
new
york
came
after
a
weeklong
trial
in
a
case
involving
four
track
workers
for
the
long
island
railroad
judge
ward
found
that
the
workers
contracted
the
disease
after
they
were
bitten
by
ticks
while
on
the
job
he
ordered
the
new
york
stateowned
commuter
line
to
pay
the
workers
more
than
to
compensate
for
pain
and
suffering
in
addition
to
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages
summer
camps
schools
companies
with
facilities
in
rural
or
semirural
areas
and
homeowners
who
rent
to
vacationers
are
among
the
groups
that
need
to
be
worried
about
this
ruling

firm

case
who
wrote
a
legal
article
three
years

warning
property
owners
of
the
potential
liability
even
a
family
that
invites
friends
over
for
a
backyard
barbecue
might
be
potentially
liable
lawsuits
for
insect
bites
while
rare
arent
unheardof
a
summer
vacationer
in
southampton
ny
last
year
sued
the
owner
of
the
home
she
rented
claiming
that
a
tick
on
the
property
gave
her
rocky
mountain
spotted
fever
in
also
on
long
island
a
jury
ordered
an
outdoor
restaurant
to
pay
more
than
million
to
a
patron
who
was
stung
by
a
bee
causing
an
allergic
reaction
and
permanent
quadriplegia
the
judge
later
threw
out
the
award
citing
no
evidence
that
a
beehive
was
near
the
restaurant
but
lawyers
say
that
the
attention
to
lyme
disease
throughout
the
country
its
most
prevalent
in
new
england
the
middle
atlantic
states
wisconsin
minnesota
and
the
northwest
may
make
this
particular
insect
bite
a
particularly
litigious
one
the
illness
already
has
proved
to
be
a
source
of
controversy
in
the
courtroom
over
such
issues
as
the
type
of
medical
care
insurers
will
cover
and
medical
malpractice
claims
against
doctors
for
not
diagnosing
the
disease
lawyers
say
workerscompensation
claims
related
to
lyme
disease
have
become
common
in
some
states
in
recent
years
payments
in
workerscompensation
cases
however
are
limited
to
medical
costs
and
lost
earnings
the
case
before
judge
ward
dealt
with
a
potentially
much
more
lucrative
avenue
for
damages
because
it
involved
the
question
of
negligence
unlike
the
workers
compensation
process
the
law
governing
injuries
to
rail
workers
allows
for
a
finding
of
negligence
and
as
a
result
for
additional
payments
for
pain
and
suffering
property
owners
and
lawyers
say
that
negligence
claims
can
be
made
in
many
other
situations
where
people
are
exposed
to
the
ticks
that
carry
the
disease
ira
m
maurer
a
partner
at
new
york
law
firm
elkind
flynn
maurer
who
represented
the
rail
workers
says
the
decision
will
help
to
establish
the
duty
of
all
sorts
of
property
owners
to
protect
against
lyme
disease
lawyers
caution
that
despite
judge
wards
decision
winning
a
lawsuit
for
damages
caused
by
lyme
disease
may
prove
difficult
for
one
thing
victims
have
to
demonstrate
that
they
have
pinned
down
when
and
where
they
got
the
tick
bite
judge
ward
found
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
railroad
case
got
lyme
disease
while
working
on
property
owned
by
the
railroad
even
though
none
of
the
men
remembered
being
bitten
the
workers
who
werent
outdoorsmen
likely
to
be
exposed
elsewhere
to
the
insects
said
they
saw
ticks
in
the
high
grass
that
surrounded
some
work
sites
a
spokeswoman
for
the
railroad
says
that
there
was
no
proof
that
the
four
men
were
bitten
while
on
the
job
and
that
the
railroad
is
considering
an
appeal
the
railroad
also
disputes
judge
wards
finding
that
it
didnt
do
enough
to
protect
employees
the
spokeswoman
says
the
railroad
provides
track
workers
with
insect
repellent
and
special
pants
to
protect
against
bug
bites
debate
in
the
scientific
community
over
lyme
disease
could
open
up
some
legal
defenses
for
property
owners
such
as
questioning
whether
a
victim
actually
has
the
disease
rather
than
some
other
illness
earlier
this
week
the
journal
of
the
american
medical
association
reported
that
doctors
overly
diagnose
patients
as
having
lyme
disease
and
damages
awarded
to
a
victim
also
might
be
influenced
by
medical
disputes
over
the
degree
of
harm
that
lyme
disease
causes
because
of
health
and
safety
concerns
some
groups
and
companies
already
take
special
measures
to
protect
against
lyme

your

of

if
you
still
want
to
be

determine
how
you
can
improve
your

a
letter
of
recommendation
from
a
professor
who
knows
you
well
and
can
give
an
honest
positive
recommendation
is
far
better
than
one
from

also
dont

give

a

to

no

of

saying
no

i

turned
down
writing
recommendations
for
some
students
because
i
did
not
know
them
well
enough
to
make
any
meaningful
comments
and
some
because
i
honestly
could
not
recommend
them
at
that
point
rewrite
your
personal
statement
take
it
by
an
english
professor
or
some
other
friendly
person
with
skill
and
experience
in
writing

get

both

review
your

the

you

it

a

multiplies
within

in

the
protozoan
multiplies
in
the
intestinal
cells
and
eggs
are
shed
in
the
cats
feces
the
protozoa
can
cross
the

infect
the

the

may
be

it

ive

were
definitely
involved
my

turned
into
a

for
a
short
time
while
in
the

he
was
fiftythree
at
the
time
and
he
was
on
separate
medications
the
family
protested
but
the
doctors
were
adamant
telling
us
that
none
of
the
drugs
interact
they
even
took
the
attitude
that
if
he
was
disoriented
they
should
put
him
on
something
else
as
well
with
the
help
of
an
md
friend
of
the
family
we
had
all
his
medication
discontinued
he
had
a
seizure
that
night
and
was
put
back
on
one
drug
two
days
later
he
was
his

i
guess
there
arent
many
medical
texts
that
address
the

of
interactions
i
saw
the

thing
happen
to
my

i
can
more

less
validate
your
take
on
hospitals
it
seems
to
me
that
medical
science
understands
precious
little
about
taking
care
of
the
human
machine
drugs
are
given
as
a
response
to
symptoms
and
i
guess
that
makes
sense
since
all
the
studies
that
validate
the
effectiveness
of
those
drugs
are
based
on
a
narrow
assessment
of
the
degree
of
particular
symptoms
but
there
seems
to
be
very
little
appreciation
for
the
wellbeing
of
a
person
outside
of
the
numbers
that
appear

i

needless

called

later
learnt

better

got
two

got
one

am
waiting
to
hear
from
the

school
let
me
be
honest
about
my
experiences
and
impressions
about
the
medical
school
admissions
process
numbers
gpa
mcats
are
not
everything
but
they
are
probably
more
important
than
anything
else
in
fact
some
schools
screen
out
applicants
based
on
these
numbers
and
never
even
look
at
your
other
qualities
of
course
when
this
happens
dont
expect
a
refund
on
your
application
fee
but
the
fact
that
you
got
four
interviews
tells
me
that
you
have
the
numbers
and
are
very
well
qualified
academically
you
mentioned
one
response
was
it
an
acceptance
denial
or
waitlist
if
i
assume
the
worst
that
it
was
a
denial
then
you
still
have
a
great
probability
of
acceptance
somewhere
how
did
your
interviews
go
as
for
how
long
you
have
to
wait
ive
called
a
few
schools
who
never
contacted
me
for
anything
many
of
them
told
me
that
the
interview
season
for
them
was
over
and
that
if
i
havent
heard
by
now
i
can
assume
a
denial
many
rejection
letters
are
not
sent
out
until
may
or
as
late
as
june
but
some
schools
are
still
interviewing
i
really
dont
think
you
should
worry
dont
become
fixated
on
the
mailbox
go
out
have
fun
be
very
proud
of
yourself
what
do
people
think
of
the
medical
school
admissions
process
i
had
a
very
mediocre
gpa
but
high
mcat
scores
and
i
have
been
working
as
a
software
engineer
for
two
years
i
majored
in
computer
science
at
stanford
still
i
think
the
profile
of
the
person
who
has
the
best
chance
of
getting
admitted
is
something
like
this
very
important
gpa

anyway
you

i
think
admissions
committees
are
bound
in
many
ways
by
the
numbers
but
would
like
very
much
to
understand
each
person
as
an
individual
sometimes
thats
just
not
practical
but
getting
four
interviews
is
an
indicator
that
you
have
the
numbers
hopefully
you
were
able
to
impress
them
with
your
character

it
falls
off
a
cliff
to
down
from
on
this
type
of
loss
is
difficult

i
am
currently
using
some
old
siemens
behind
the
ear
aids
which
keep
me
roughly
functional
but
leave
a
lot
to
be
desired
recently
i
had
an
opportunity
to
test
the
widex
behind
the
ear
aids
for
several
weeks
these
have
four
independent
programs
which
are
intended
to
be
customized
for
different
hearing
situations
and
can
be
reprogramed
i
found
them
to
be
a
definite
improvement
over
my
current
aids
and
was
about
to
go
ahead
with
them
until
another
local
outfit
advertised
a
free
trial
of
another
programmable
system
called
resound
unfortunately
i
was
only
able
to
try
the
resound
aids
in
their
office
for
about
minutes
and
i
couldnt
compare
them
head
to
head
with
the
widex
nevertheless
it
did
appear
to
me
that
they
were
superior
and
i
was
impressed
by
what
i
was
able
to
read
about
the
theory
behind
them
which
i
will
give
in
a
separate
posting
they
also
carry
the
widex
aids
and
had
one
patient
presumably
wealthy
who
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
the
resound
even
though
he
had
purchased
the
widex
only
months
ago
the
problem
is
that
the
resound
aids
are
about
twice
as
expensive
as
the
widex
and
other
programmable
aids
i
could
take
a
trip
to
europe
on
the
difference
being
a
lover
of
bargains
and
hating
to
spend
money
i
am
having
a
hard
time
persuading
myself
to
go
with
the
resounds
i
would
appreciate
any
opinions

this
and

when

david
this

looks
like
a
good
one
gordon
rubenfeld
did
a
medline
search
and
also
sent
me
the
same
reference
through
email
since
commercial
yogurt
does
not
always
have
a
good
lactobacillus
a
or
bulgaricus
culture
a
negative
finding
would
not
have
been
too
informative
this
is
often
the
reason
why
lactobacillus
acidophilus
tablets
are
recommended
rather
than
yogurt
i
guess
the
next
question
is
why
would
this
introduction
of
good
bacteria
back
into
the
gut
decrease
the
incidence
of
vaginal
candida
blooms
if
the
anus
was
not
serving
as
a
candida
reservoira
fact
that
gordon
r
vehementy
denys
i
see
two
possible
theories
one
the
l
acidophilus
which
is
a
facultatively
anaerobic
bacterium
could
make
it
through
the
gut
and
colonize
the
rectal
area
to
overgrow
the
candida
this
would
not
explain
the
reoccurance
of
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
after
the
yogurt
ingestion
was
stopped
though
the
other
is
that
the
additional
bacteria
in
the
intestinal
tract
remove
most
of
the
glucose
from
the
feces
and
candida
looses
its
major
food
source
getting
lactobacillus
acidophilus
to
colonize
the
vaginal
tractwhere
it
is
normally
found
would
have
a
much
better
effect
on
the
recurrance
of
vaginal
yeast
blooms
though
an
acetic
acid
lactobacillus
acidophilus
douche
has
been
used
to
get
this
effect
but
ive
not
seen
any
such
treatment
reported
in
the
medical
literature
this
would
be
an
example
of
physicians
conducting
their
own
clinical
trials
to
try
to
come
up
with
treatments
that
help
their
patients
when
this
is
done
in
private
practice
the
results
are
rarely
if
ever
published
it
was
the
hallmark
of
medicine
until
the
modern
age
emerged
with
clinical
trials
it
really
raises
a
big
question
does
the
medical
profession
cast
out
the
adventerous
few
who
try
new
treatments
to
help
patients
or
does
it
look
the
other
way
this
particular
issue
is
really
a
very
simple
one
since
no
real
dangerous
therapy
is
involvedeven
the
antifungals
are
not
all
that
dangerous
but
there
are
some
areaslike
edta
chelation
therapy
where
the
fire
is
pretty
hot
and
somebody
could
get
burned
its
really
tough
do
i
follow
only
well
established
protocols
and
then
give
up
if
they
dont
work
that
well
or
do
it
try
something
that
looks
like
it
will
work
but
hasnt
been
proven
to
work
yet
my
stand
is
to
consider
other
treatment
possibilities
especially
if
they
involve
little
or
no
risk
to
the
patient
getting
good
bacteria
back
into
the
gut
after
antibiotic
treatment
is
one
treatment
possibility
the
other
is
getting

acidophilus

making

look
up

also
the

works
equally

true
but
what
about
showing
the
missing
part
of
a
leaf
is
this
corona
discharge
yup
the
demonstration
to
which
you
refer
consists
of
placing
a
leaf
between
the
plates
and
taking
a
kirlian
photograph
of
it
you
then
cut
off
part
of
the
leaf
put
the
top
plate
back
on
and
take
another
kirlian
photograph
you
see
pretty
much
the
same
image
in
both
cases
turns
out
the
effect
isnt
nearly
so
striking
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
clean
the
plates
between
photographs
seems
that
the
moisture
from
the
leaf
that
you
left
on
the
place
conducts
electricity
surprise
surprise
this
is
true
but
its
not
quite
the
whole
story
there
were
actually
some
people
who
were
more
careful
in
their
methodology
who
also
replicated
the
phantom
leaf
effect
one
of
the
most
influential
critics
of
kirlian
electrophotography
is
a
theosophist
and
threfore
presumably
willing

entertain
the
hypothesis
of

for

named
a
j
ellison
after
years
of
studying
the
method
and
the
claims
ellison
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
photographic
images
are
what
we
calls
lichtenberg
figures
an
effect
of
intermittent
ionization
of
the
air
around
the
object
its
a
bit
more
complicated
than
not
wiping
off
the
plates
but
it
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
kirlian
electrophotography
has
much
more
limited
value
if
any
than
was
previously
widely
thought
electrical
and
magnetic
fields
generated
by
the
body
are
much
too
small
to
be
of

its
another
opporitunity

a

hundred

for
a
completely
unnecessary
procedure
the
rationale
for
which
until
recently
has
been
accepted
without
question
by
most
parents
of
newborns
one
could
also
imagine
that
complications
arising
from

infections
sloppy
jobs
etc
are
far
more
common
than
the
remote
chance
of
penile
cancer
it
is
purported
to
prevent
cant
imagine
what
its
like
to
have
a
penis
much
less
a
foreskin
i
guess
if
american
medicine
did
an
artistic
job
of
circumcising
every
male
then
the
visual
result
would
be
somewhat
more
natural
in

i
remember
at

on

goes

americans
are
just

hung

to

cleaning
it
thats
just
way

you

i

yup
the
demonstration
to
which
you
refer
consists
of
placing
a
leaf
between
the
plates
and
taking
a
kirlian
photograph
of
it
you
then
cut
off
part
of
the
leaf
put
the
top
plate
back
on
and
take
another
kirlian
photograph
you
see
pretty
much
the
same
image
in
both
cases
turns
out
the
effect
isnt
nearly
so
striking
if
you
take
the

to
clean
the

seems
that
the

from
the

that
you
left

conducts

this
is

its

quite
the
whole

there
were
actually
some
people
who
were
more
careful
in
their
methodology
who
also
replicated
the

you
can
also
replicate
the

with

moisten

stop

im

its
not

wants

go
back

the
better
choice
and

said
that
he

the

is

i
do
occasionally
have
some
nasty
heartburn
that
is
probably
related

it

on

if
im

slowly

food
occasionally
gets
stuck
before
reaching
my
stomach
this
results
in
a
period
of
painful
spasms
as
the
food
attempts
to
pass
the
obstruction
fortunately
the
food
has
always
managed
to
pass
but
this
is
annoying
and
causes
frequent
discomfort
my
doctor
wants
to
dilate
the
ring
using
the
following
procedure
use
an
endoscope
to
examine
the
esophagus
and
stomach
for
any
inflammation
then
cut
through
the
ring
and
dilate
it
by
passing
some
kind
of
balloon
or
something
thru
the
esophagous
i
would
like

know
if
anyone
out

doneif

was
it

and
that
they
cannot
do
surgery
until
august

so
it
is
now
april
she
is
supposed
to
rest
a

and
drink

but
she
has

go
to

she
wonders
why
they
have
given
her
no
medicine
she
plans
to
call
back
her
doctors
office
clinic
and
try
to
get
answers
to
these
questions
but
i
told
her
i
would
also
write
in
to
scimed
and
see
what
i
could
find
out
about
why
there
were
so
many
xrays
and
whether
it
seems
ok
to
wait
in
line
or
more
months
for
surgery
for
something
like
this
or
whether
she
should
be
looking
elsewhere
for
her
care
she
does
plan
to
get
a
second
opinion
too
i
will
pass
info
on

her
it
never
hurts
to
get

one

a

mrs
a
research
team
led
by

md

conducted
a
study
on
elderly
patients
who
were
believed
to
be
suffering
from

at

the

calls
for
lengthy
memory
function
and
neuropsychological
tests
which
can
be
very
upsetting
to
the
patient
are
not
definitive
and
can
only
be
confirmed
by
autopsy
in
addition
to
alzheimers
disease
the
new
clinical
proton
mrs
exam
may
have
applications
in
diagnosing
other
dementias
including
aidsrelated
dementia
parkinsons
disease
and
huntingtons
disease
weve
developed
a
simple
test
which
can
be
administered
quickly
and
relatively
inexpensively
using
existing
mri
equipment
fitted
with
either
the
mrs
or
probe
software
said
dr
ross
adding
this
will
help
physicians
to
diagnose
alzheimers
earlier
and
intervene
with
therapeutics
before
the
progression
of
the
disease
causes
further
damage
to
the
delicate
inner
workings
of
the
brain
dr
ross
and
his
hmri
team
measured
a
family
of
chemicals
in
the
brain
known
as
inositols
and
myoinositol
mi
acted
as
a
marker
in
the
study
in
comparison
to
healthy
patients
those
diagnosed
with
alzheimers
showed
a
percent
increase
in
mi
while
their
level
of
another
chemical
called
nacetylaspartate
naa
was
significantly
lower
indicating
a
loss
of
brainstimulating
neurons
believed
to
be
associated
with
the
progression
of
the
disease
current
drug
therapy
for
alzheimers
disease
is
widely
considered
to
be
inadequate
this
is
attributable
dr
ross
believes
to
the
theory
that
alzheimers
is
caused
by
an
interruption
in
the
transmission
of
the
chemical
acetylcholine
to
the
nerve
cells
this
belief
has
been
adhered
to
over
the
last
years
and
consequently
most
drugs
to
treat
alzheimers
were
based
on
the
changing
receptors
for
acetylcholine
physicians
have
a
real
need
for
a
test
to
differentiate
alzheimers
from
other
dementias
to
provide
the
patient
and
his
or
her
family
with
a
firm
diagnosis
and
to
monitor
future
treatment
protocols
for
the
treatment
of
this
disease
for
this
reason
we
consider
this
test

major
advancement

what
is
alzheimers
disease
and
how
is
it
caused
alzheimers
disease
ad
is
an
incurable
degenerative
disease
of
the
brain
first
described
in
by
the
german
neuropathologist
alois
alzheimer
as
the
disease
progresses
it
leads
to
loss
of
memory
and
mental
functioning
followed
by
changes
in
personality
loss
of
control
of
bodily
functions
and
eventually
death
how
many
people
does
it
affect
alzheimers
disease
affects
an
estimated
million
adults
in
the
united
states
and
is
the
fourth
leading
cause
of
death
taking
approximately
lives
each
year
while
alzheimers
debilitates
its
victims
it
is
equally
devastating
both
emotionally
and
financially
for
patients
families
ad
is
the
most
common
cause
of
dementia
in
adults
symptoms
worsen
every
year
and
death
usually
occurs
within
years
of
initial
onset
what
are
its
signs
and
symptoms
although
the
cause
of
ad
is
not
known
two
risk
factors
have
been
identified
advanced
age
and
genetic
predisposition
the
risk
of
developing
ad
is
less
than
one
percent
before
the
age
of
yars
old
but
increases
steeply
in
each
successive
decade
of
life
to
reach
percent
by
the
age
of
in
patients
with
familial
ad
immediate
family
relatives
have
a
percent
chance
of
developing
ad
one
of
its
first
symptoms
is
severe
forgetfulness
caused
by
shortterm
memory
loss
dr
herman
weinreb
of
the
school
of
medicine
at
new
york
university
says
whether
forgetfulness
is
a
serious
symptom
or
not
is
largely
a
matter
of
degree
and
suggests
the
following
criteria
forgetting
the
name
of
someone
you
see
infrequently
is
normal
forgetting
the
name
of
a
loved
one
is
serious
forgetting
where
you
left
your
keys
is
normal
forgetting
how
to
get
home
is
serious
doctors
suggest
that
people
with
severe
symptoms
should
be
evaluated
in
order
to
rule
out
alzheimers

and
other
forms

any
info
would
be
appreciated
thanks
youve
asked
a
toughie
of
a
question
there
are
many
different
drugs
which
are
used
for
chemotherapy
the
overall
purpose
of
chemotherapy
dont
worry
about
the
spelling
some
of
these
crazy
medical
words
are
impossible
to
spell
is
to
either
destroy
cancer
cells
or
to
keep
them
from
growing
different
drugs
have
different
effects
on
cancer
cells
and
therefore
it
is
not
uncommon
to
use
more
than
one
drug
at
a
time
some
chemotherapeutic
drugs
are
effective
anytime
during
the
growth
cycle
of
a
cell
others
work
only
at
specific
times
during
the
cell
cycle
the
first
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
is
it
is
when
the
protein
synthesis
and
rna
systhesis
occurs
in
the
second
phase
s
synthesis
of
dna
occurs
the
third
phase
is
the
dna
splits
and
rna
and
protein
are
synthesized
aagain
in
the
fourth
phase
m
or
mitosis
the
cell
may
divide
there
are
drugs
which
are
effective
in
each
phase
some
stop
dna
synthesis
others
stop
the
cell
from
dividing
others
wreck
protein
synthesis
at
any
rate
the
end
result
that
is
being
sought
is
for
the
cancer
cells
to
stop
growing
if
what
you
are
seeking
is
practical
advice
i
apologize
for
rambling
on
the
techno
stuff
some
side
effects
are
pretty
common
chemo
drugs
are
rather
nasty
it
can
cause
a
person
to
lose
their
appetite
and
to
experience
nausea
and
vomiting
things
to
help
this
include
eating
small
frequent
meals
it
is
also
suggested
that
if
nauseavomiting
hereafter
known
as
nv
occurs
that
the
person
notify
the
doctor
there
are
medicines
tthat
help
nausea
diarrhea
can
be
an
effect
antidiarrheal
medications
can
be
given
and
good
skincare
and
fluid
intake
are
important
probably
the
one
of
biggest
concsern
is
hair
loss
this
does
not
always
happen
it
depends
on
what
drugs
are
being
given
and
on
the
person
themself
different
people
taking
the
same
drug
can
and
do
have
different
side
effects
i
have
seen
some
literature
which
states
that
wearing
a
snug
headband
andor
wearing
an
ice
cap
can
help
reduce
hair
loss
presumably
by
reducing
blood
flow
to
the
scalp
if
anyone
has
seen
research
on
this
too
i
would
love
to
see
it
and
possibly
some
bib
data
i
highly
recommend

to

reguarding
having
a

circumsized
what
are
the

cons
all
weve
heard
is
its
up
to
the

unfortonately
that
truly
is
about
the
best
summation
of
the
research
that
there
is
advantages
stated
of
circumcison
included
probably
prevention
of
penile
cancer
which
interestingly
occurs
mostly
in
men
whose
personal
hygiene
is
exceptionally
poor
simplicity
of

prevention
of

and
prevention
of

disadvantages

pain
etc
i
apologize
i
am
trying
to
pull
this
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
will
post
what
i
discovered
in
research
i
did
a
paper
on
the
topic
in
my
research
class
in
nursing
school
it
really
is
a
decision
that
is
up
to
the
parents
some
parents
use
the
reasoning
that
they
will
look
like
daddy
and
like
their
friends
as
justification
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
just
be
sure
it
is
what
you
want
to
do
since
it
is
rather
difficult
to
uncircumcise
a
male
although
a
major
surgical
procedure
exists
how
about
the
pregnant
woman
sitting
in
a
tub
of
water
weve
heard
stories
of
infection
etc
how
about
after
the
water
has
broken
as
long
as
your
membranes
have
not
broken
and
you
have
not
had
any
problems
with
your
pregnancy
it
should
be
ok
to
sit
in
a
tub
of
water
however
i
would
recommend
using
your
own
bathtub
in
your
own
home
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
guarantee
the
cleanliness
and
safety
of
public
hot
tubs
a
nice
warm
bath
can
be
very
relaxing
especially
if
your
back
is
killing
you
and
it
would
possibly
be
advisable
to
avoid
bubble
bath
soap
esp
if
you
are

it

that

sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus

are
in
my
opinion
still
the
most
reliable
indicators
for

treatment

i
for
one
will
continue
to
recommend
the
most
logical
changes
in
ones
diet
or
through
supplementation
to
counteract
or
prevent
kidney
stones
of
either
type
and
they
definitely
wont
include
an
increase
in
calcium
if
the

have
been
identified
as
being

and
peoples

the

summarized
he
has
had
extra
heartbeats
for
the

to
years
and
once
was
symptomatic
from

with
some
lightheadedness
he

young
thin

recent

all

not

im
willing

accept
the
extra
beats
as
normal
but
dont
want
to
ignore
them
if
they
might
be
some
kind
of
warning
symptom
the
number
of
pvcs
seems
to
increase
throughout
the
day

with
exercise
or
something
as
simple
as
climbing
some

also
if
i

up
after

i
tend

get
a

of
extra

could
they
possibly
be
related
to
the
esophagous
problems
both
seemed
to
develop
at
about
the

time
i
not
an
expert
on
heart
problems

pvcs
are
common
and
have
been
overtreated
in

build
you
do

is

that
my
pvcs
come
and
go
with
some
months
causing
anxiety
taking
on
more
fluids
seems
to
help
and
they
seem
worse
in
the
summer
remember
that
a
slow
heart
rate
will
allow
more
pvcs
to
be
apparent
so
perhaps
it
is
an
indication
of
a
healthy
cardiac
system

ask

i
might

an

the

colonic

cross

has

i

know
just
in

rebecca
millipedes
i
understand
are
vegetarian
and
therefore
almost
certainly
will
not
bite
and
are
not
poisonous
centipedes
are
carnivorous
and
although
i
dont
have
any
absolute
knowledge
on
this
i
would
tend
to
think
that
youre
in
no
danger
from
anything
but
a
concerted
assault
by
several
million
of
them
g
not
sure
of
this
but
i
think
some
millipedes
cause
a
toxic
reaction
sting
so
i
would
not
assume
that
they
are
not
dangerous
merely
on
the
basis
of
vegetarianism
after
all
wasps
are
vegetarian
too

about

my
girlfriend
is
in
pain
from
kidney
stones
she
says
that
because
she
has
no
medical
insurance
she
cannot
get
them
removed
my
question
is
there
any
way
she
can
treat
them
herself
or
at
least
mitigate
their
effects
any
help
is
deeply
appreciated
advice
referral
to
literature
etc
thank
you
dave
carvell
first
off
i
would
consider
the
severity
of
the
pain
i
had
stones
several
years
ago
and
theres
now
way
i
could
have
made
it
without
heavy
duty
doses
of
morphine
and
demerol
and
a
two
week
stay
in
the
hospital
i
was
told
that
there
was
nothing
that
i
could
take
that
would
dissolve
them
if
the
stones
are
passible
the
best
thing
she
could
do
is
drink
lots
of
water
and
hope
that
they
pass
but
every
time
they
move
a
little
the
pain
will
be
excrutiating
i
was
told
by
my
doctor
at
that
time
that
the
pain
was
comparable
to
that
of
childbirth
yes
by
a
male
doctor
so
im
sure
some
of
you
women
will
disagree
id
really
like
to
know
the
truth
in
this
so
maybe
some
of
you
women
who
have
had
a
baby
and
a
kidney
stone
could

handled

have

was
really
a

with

home
in

now
i
know
this
is
debatable
but
please
dont
nominate
him
again
if
anyone
can
fill
in
some
of
the
question
marks
on
the
list
please
drop
me
a

was
two

ago
since
then
i
have
received
a

from
science
culture
canada
a
division
of
supply
and
services
canada
to
research
the
book
since
my
old
posting
the
book
has
evolved
into
an
educational
book
for
kids
aged
though
this
may
change
again
it
will
have
about
twopage
spreads
with
a
large
graphic
in
the
middle
and

boxes
all
around
on
the
following
subjects
vital
statistics
and
photo
of
the
scientist
personal
statement
from
the
scientist
narrative
of
a
few
moments
in
the
life
of
the
scientist
what
i
was
doing
when
i
was
so
you
want
to
be
a
insert
kind
of
scientist
experiment
you
can
do
there
will
be
an
appendix
with
more
scientists
with
one
paragraph
biographies
who
didnt
quite
make
it
to
the
double
spreads
the
whole
thing
will
then
be
published
on
cdrom
with
video
and
sound
clips
for
added
richness
i
am
looking
for
a
cdrom
publisher
as
well
the
text
part
may
also
be
available
on
the
canarie
electronic
highway
being
developed
in
canada
as
well
i
am
still
looking
for
a
publisher
though
penguin
canada
came
close
to
being
it
hope
to
find
one
soon
i
would
like
to
again
ask
for
more
nominations
especially
in
the
pure
sciences
of
physics
chemistry
and
biology
also
criticisms
of
the
list
are
welcomed
also
women
and
frenchcanadian
scientists
are
needed
i
hope
this
posting
will
get
others
to
nominate
more
great
canadian
scientists
and
to
discuss
what
is
great
what
is
canadian

nobody
thought
he
would
fall
off

for
no

only

miles

for

the

students
are
can
anyone
suggest
techniques
for
this
type
of
memorization
i
have
had
reasonable
success
with
nemonics
and
memory
tricks
like
thinking
up
little
stories
to
associate
unrelated
things
but
i
have
never
applied
them
to
large

has
anyone
had

any
particular

can

no
griping
about

all
you
have
to
do
is
learn
the
material
conceptually
i
have
no
problem
with
that
it
is
one
of
my
strong
points

you
cant
get
around

rebecca
millipedes
i
understand
are
vegetarian
and
therefore
almost
certainly
will
not
bite
and
are
not
poisonous
centipedes
are
carnivorous
and
although
i
dont
have
any
absolute
knowledge
on
this
i
would
tend
to
think
that
youre
in
no
danger
from
anything
but
a
concerted
assault
by
several
million
of
them
g
not
sure
of
this
but
i
think
some
millipedes
cause
a
toxic
reaction
sting
so
i
would
not
assume
that
they
are
not
dangerous
merely
on
the
basis
of
vegetarianism
after
all
wasps
are
vegetarian
too
dnc
as
a
child
i
can
remember
picking
up
a
centipede
and
getting
a
rather
painful
sting
but
it
quickly
subsided
much
less
painful
compared
to
a
bee
sting
centipedes
have
a
poison
claw
one
of
the
front
feet
to
stun
their
prey

in

experience

did

a
family
member
of
mine
is
suffering
from
a
severe
depression
brought
on
by
menopause
as
well
as
a
mental
break
down
she
is
being
treated
with
halydol
with
some
success
but
the
treatments
being
provided
through
her
psychiatrist
are
not
satisfactory
someone
suggested
contacting
a
nutritionist
to
discuss
alternative
treatment
since
she
is
sensitive
to
medication
i
think
this
is
a
good
suggestion
but
dont
know
where
to
begin
if
anyone
can
suggest
a
philly
area
nutritionist
or
else
some
literature
to
read
id
appreciate
it
lida
i
can
emphasize
with
your
situation
both
my
wife
and
i
suffered
from
bouts
of
depression
hers
was
brought
on
by
breast
cancer
and
mine
was
a
rebound
stress
reaction
to
her
modified
radical
mastectomy
and
chemotherapy
lida
i
used
my
knowledge
of
nutrition
to
get
her
through
her
six
months
of
chemotherapywith
the
approval
of
her
oncologist
when
severe
depression
set
in
a
few
months
after
the
chemo
stopped
i
tried
to
use
supplements
to
bring
her
out
of
it
i
had
cured
her
pms
using
supplements
and
i
really
thought
that
i
knew
enough
about
the
role
of
diet
in
depression
to
take
care
of
her
depression
as
well
it
didnt
work
and
she
was
put
on
prozac
by
her
oncologist
two
winters
agothree
years
after
by
wifes
breast
cancer
i
got
hit
with
severe
depressionpretty
typical
and
one
reason
why
many
marriages
break
up
after
breast
cancer
or
another
stressor
i
tried
to
take
care
of
it
for
several
months
with
supplementation
didnt
work
my
internist
ended
up
putting
me
on
prozac
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
list
of
several
studies
that
have
been
done
using
niacin
folate
and
to
cure
depression
im
not
going
to
do
that
because
all
you
would
be
doing
is
flying
blind
like
i
was
lida
i
do
believe
that
depression
can
have
a
dietary
component
but
the
problem
is
that
you
need
to
know
exactly
what
the
problem
is
and
then
use
an
approach
which
will
fix
the
problem
for
chemotherapy
i
knew
exactly
what
drugs
were
going
to
be
used
and
exactly
what
nutrients
would
be
affected
same
thing
for
pms
i
was
flying
blind
for
both
of
these
stressors
but
the
literature
that
i
used
to
devise
a
treatment
program
was
pretty
good
depression
is
just
too
complicated
what
you
really
need
is
a
nutritional
scan
this
is
not
a
diet
analysis
but
an
analysis
of
your
bodies
nutrient
reserves
for
every
vitamin
and
mineralexcept
vitamin
c
you
have
a
reserve
the
rda
is
not
designed
to
give
you
enough
of
any
nutrient
to
keep
these
reserves
full
it
is
only
designed
to
keep
them
from
being
emptied
which
would
cause
clinical
pathology
stress
will
increase
your
need
for
many
vitamins
and
minerals
this
is
when
your
reserves
become
very
important
lida
without
your
permission

in

puzzle

let
me
measure
the
nutrient
reserve
for
almost
all
the
vitamins

minerals
that
are
known
to
be
required

uses

i
also

that
the
pritikin
clinic
in

has
a
similiar
lab
setup
for
physicians
reading
this
post
i
would
suggest
that
you
get
the
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
that
has
just
been
publishedfeb
by
mosby
i
have
been
using
alpers
manual
of
nutritional
therapeuticsa
little
brown
series
book
as
a
supplemental
text
for
my
course
but
alpers
is
geared
more
to
residency
training
two
mds
have
written
this
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
and
it
is
geared
more
towards
medical
student
education
and
it
does
a
good
job
of
covering
the
lab
tests
that
can
be
run
to
assess
a
patients
nutritional
status
let
me
quote
a
few
sentences
from
the
preface
of
this
new
text
socalled
nutrition
specialists
were
in
reality
gastroenterologists
hematologists
or
pediatricians
who
just
happened
to
profess
some
knowledge
of
nutrition
as
it
related
to
their
field
of
practice
unfortunately
about
two
thirds
of
the
medical
schools
in
the
united
states
require
no
formal
instruction
in
nutrition
but
times
and
medical
practice
have
changed
more
than
half
of
the
leading
causes
of
death
in
this
country
are
nutrition
related
this
monograph
should
accomplish
the
following
two
objectives
it
should
complement
your
medical
training
by
emphasizing
the
relevance
of
nutrition
to
your
medical
practice
and
it
should
heighten
your
awareness
of
nutrition
as
a
medical
speciality
that
is
vitally
important
for
both
disease
prevention
and
the
treatment
of
diseases
of
essentially
every
organ
system

my
advise
to
you
is
that
you
tell
your
family
members
to
try
to
find
a
physician
who
has
an
understanding
of
the
role
that
vitamins
and
minerals
yes
even
magnesium
may
play
a
role
in
depression
play
in
depression
and
who
could
get
a
nutritional
profile
run
menopause
is
often
a
time
when
women
suffer
depression
there
are
a
lot
of
hormonal
changes
that
are
occuring
but
they
are
not
the
same
ones
that
occur
during
pms
a
nutritionist
may
also
be
able
to
help
not
too
long
ago
a
poster
mentioned
that
his
nutritionist
had
diagnosed
a
selenium
deficiency
based
on
a
red
cell
glutathionine
peroxidase
testthe
specific
test
for
the
selenium
reserve
most
clinical
labs
will
not
run
this
test
and
i
advised
him
to
try
to
make
sure
that
the
lab
that
did
the
test
was
certified
there
are
also
a
lot
of
hair
and
nail
analysis
labs
setup
to
do
trace
mineral
analysis
but
these
labs
are
not
regulated
checks
of
these
labs
using
certified
standards
and
also
those
doing
water
lead
analysis
showed
some
pretty
shoddy
testing
was
going
on
if
you
or
anyone
else
finds
someone
who
will
run
these
speciality
nutrition
tests
make
sure
that
they
are
using
a
lab
that
has
been
certified
under
cliathe
clinical
laboratory
improvement
act
a
diet
analysis
may
be
helpful
since
many
nutrient
reserves
have
been
shown
to
correlate
fairly
well
with
the
dietary
intake
as
monitored
by
food
logging
and
software
analysisnutritionist
iv
and
other
software
programs
but
there
are
still
about
half
of
the
nutrients
required
by
humans
that
do
not
show
a
very
good
correlation
between
apparent
dietary
intake
and
reserve
status
until
we
have
more
nutritional
assessment
clinical
labs
in
operation
in
the
us
and
physicians
who
have
been
trained
how
to
use
the
nutritional
profile
that
these
labs
provide
to
devise
a
treatment
approach
that
uses
diet
changes
and
supplementation
antidepressants
will
probably
continue
to
be
the
best
approach
to
depression

subject
re
earwax
hi
stephen
ear
wax
is
a
healthy
way
to
help
prevent
ear
infections
both
by
preventing
a
barrier
and
also
with
some
antibiotic
properties
too
much
can
block
the
external
auditory
canal
the
hole
in
the
outside
of
the
ear
and
cause
some
hearing
problems
it
is
very
simple
and
safe
to
remove
excess
wax
on
your
own
or
at
your
physicians
office
you
can
take
a
syringe
no
needles
and
fill
it
with
warm
water
cold
can
cause
fainting
and
otc
hydrogen
peroxide
then
point
the
ear
towards
the
ceiling
about
degrees
up
and
insert
the
tip
of
the
syringe
helps
to
have
someone
else
do
this
and
firmly
expell
the
solution
depending
on
the
size
of
the
syringe
and
the
tenacity
of
the
wax
this
could
take
several
rinses
if
you
place
a
bowl
under
the
ear
to
catch
the
water
it
will
be
much
drier
you
can
buy
a
syringe
with
a
special
tip
at
your
local
pharmacy
or
just
use
whatever
you
may
have
if
wax
is
old
it
will
be
harder
and
darker
you
can
try
adding
a
few
drops
of
olive
oil
into
the
ear
during
a
shower
to
soften
up
the
wax
do
this
for
a
couple
days
then
try
syringing
again
it
is
also
safe
to
point
your
ear
up
at
the
shower
head
and
allow
the
water
to
rinse
it
out

the

changes
in

diet

through

to

they

an

if

you

have
calcium

kidney

are
primarily
caused
by
diet
as

when

it

not

where
i

of

to
avoid

nothing
can
be
further
from
the
truth
kidney
stones
can
be
caused
by
tumors
and
this
possibility
has
to
be
ruled
out
but
once
it
is
diet
is
a
good
way
of
preventing
a
reoccurance
same
thing
with
heart
disease
and
cancer
if
you
suspect
that
you
may
have
a
problem
with
one
of
these
diseases
dont
use
what
im
going
to
tell
you
or
what
you
read
in
some
book
to
avoid
going
to
a
doctor
you
have
to
go
hopefully
you
will
find
a
doctor
who
knows
enough
about
nutrition
to
help
you
change
your
risk
factors
for
both
diseases
as
part
of
a
treatment
programbut
the
odds
are
that
you
will
not
and
thats
why
im
here
when
my
wife
detected
a
lump
in
here
breast
i
didnt
say
dont
worry
my
vitamin
e
will
take
care
of
it
any
breast
lump
has
to
be
worked
up
by
a
physician
plan
and
simple
if
its
begninwhich
most
are
fine
then
maybe
a
diet
change
and
supplementation
will
prevent
further
breast
lumps
from
occuring
but
let
me
tell
you
right
now
if
you
have
tried
diet
and

and
another
lump
returns
get
your

one
more
thing
i
am
not
an
orthomolecular
nutritionist
this
group
uses
high
dose
vitamins
and
minerals
to
treat
all
kinds
of
disease
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
vitamins
and
minerals
can
and
do
have
drug
actions
in
the
body
but
you
talk
about
flying
blind
man
this
is
really
blind
treatment
no
drug
could
ever
be
used
as
these
vitamins
and
minerals
are
being
used
im
not
saying
that
some
of
this
stuff
couldnt
be
right
on
the
money
it
may
well
be
but
my
approach
to
nutrition
is
a
lot
like
that
of
weinsier
and
morgan
the
two
mds
who
wrote
the
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
my
push
is
the
nutrient
reserves
and
the
lab
tests
needed
to
measure
these
reserves
and
then
supplementation
or
diet
changes
to
get
these
reserves
built
up
to
where
they
should
be
to
let
you
handle
stress
thats
where
im
coming
from
folks
blast
away
if
you
want
im
not
going
to
change
put
me
in
your
killfile
if
you
want
i
really
dont
care
im
averaging
email
messages
a
day
from
people
who
think
that
ive
got
something
important
to
say
but
im
also
getting
hit
by
a
few
with
an
axe
to
grind
thats
life
chromium
is
one
of
the
trace
elements
it
has
a
very
limitedbut
very
important
role
in
the
body
it
is
used
to
form
glucose
tolerance
factor
gtf
gtf
is
made
up
of
chromium
nicinamideniacin
glycine
cysteine
and
glutamic
only
the
chromium
and
the
niacin
are
needed
from
the
diet
to
form
gtf
some
foods
already
have
gtfliver
brewers
or
nutritional
yeast
and
black
pepper
when
chromium
is
in
gtf
a
pretty
good
absorption
is
seenabout
but
when
it
is
simply
present
as
a
mineral
or
mineral
chelatechromium
picolinate
its
absorption
is
much
to
lowest
for
all
the
minerals
ive
been
posting
in
misc
fitness
and
chromium
has
come
up
there
several
times
as
a
fat
burner
chromium
is
among
the
least
toxic
of
the
minerals
so
you
could
really
load
yourself
up
and
not
really
do
any
harm
i
wouldnt
do
it
though
the
adequate
and
safe
range
for
chromium
is
to
per
day
the
average
american
is
getting
about
per
day
from
hisher
diet
chromium
levels
decrease
with
age
and
many
believe
that
adult
onset
diabetes
is
primarily
a
chromium
deficiency
i
can
cite
you
several
studies
that
have
been
done
with
glucose
tolerance
in
type
ii
diabetes
but
im
not
going
to
because
for
each
positive
one
there
also
seems
to
be
a
negative
one
as
well
im
convinced
that
the
problem
is
bioavailability
when
yeastgtf
is
used
good
results
are
obtained
but
when
chromium
itself
is
used
the
results
are
usually
negative
in
addition
to
type
ii
diabetes
chromiuum
has
been
examined
in
cardiovascular
disease
and
glucoma
again
with
mixed
results
as
far
as
cardiovascular
disease
is
concerned
since
a
high
blood
glucose
level
can
lead
to
cardiovascular
disease
this
possible
link
with
chromium
isnt
too
surprising
glucoma
is
a
little
more
interesting
muscle
eye
focusing
activity
is
primarily
an
insulin
responsive
glucosedriven
metabolic
function
if
this
eye
focusing
activity
is
impairedby
a
lack
of
glucose
due
to
a
poor
insulin
response
intraocular
pressure
is
believed
to
be
elevated
in
a
fairly
large
study
of
pts
with
glaucoma
the
one
consistent
finding
was
a
low
rbc
chromium
j
am
coll
nutr
but
this
one
preliminary
study
should
not
prompt
people
to
go
out
and
start
popping
chromium
supplements
for
one
thing
just
about
every
older
person
is
going
to
have
a
low
rbc
chromium
unless
they
have
been
taking
chromium
suppleemntsyeast
since
glucoma
is
often
found
in
older
people
its
not
too
surprising
that
chromium
was
low
in
the
rbcs
if
chromium
supplementation
could
reverse
glucoma
that
would
prompt
some
attention
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
a
clinical
trail
to
check
out
this
possible
chromium
link
to
glucoma
you
could
find
out
what
your
body
chromium
pool
size
was
by
either
the
rbc
chromium
test
or
hair
analysis
most
clinical
labs
are
not
going
to
run
a
rbc
chromium
there
are
plenty
of
labs
that
will
do
a
hair
and
nail
analysis
for
you
but
i
wouldnt
use
them
there
is
just
too
much
funny
business
going
on
in
these
unregulated
labs
right
now
heres
weinsier
and
morgan
advise
on
chromium
they
do
not
consider
chromium
to
be
one
of
those
minerals
for
which
a
reliable
clinical
test
is
availablethey
dont
like
the
hair
and
nail
analysis
labs
either
and
they
also
recognize
the
rbc
chromium
is
primarily
a
research
test
that
is
not
routinely
available
in
most
clinical
chemistry
labs
this
has
to
change
and
as
more
labs
run
a
rbc
chromiuum
it
will
what
then
do
they
suggest
make
a
diagnosis
of
chromium
deficiency
based
on
a
documented
clinical
response
to
chromiumrun
a
glucose
tolerance
test
before
and
after
chromium
supplementation
once
you
make
the
diagnosis
put
the
patient
on
of
orally
each
day
or
of
yeast
per
day
whats
my
advise
dont
take
chromium
supplements
to
try
to
loose
weight
they
just
do
not
work
that
way
if
you
want
to
take
them
and
then
exercise
that
would
be
great
do
include
yeast
as
part
of
your
dietmost
americans
are
not
getting
enough
chromium
from
their
diet
if
you
do
have
a
poor
glucose
tolerance
ask
your
doctor
to
check
your
chromium
status
when
he
or
she
says
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
just
say
please
get
a
copy
of
weinsier
and
morgans
new
clinical
nutrition
textbook
and
do
what
they
say
to
do
with
patients
who
present
with
a
poor
glucose
tolerance
if
you
cant
do
that
ill
find
a
doctor
who
can
thank
you
very
much

a
few
enlightened
physicians
practicing
in
the
us
its
really
too
bad
that
most
us
medical
schools
dont
cover
nutrition
because
if
they
did
candida
would
not
be
viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
case
western
reserve
med
school
teaches
nutrition
in
its
own
section
as
well
as
covering
it
in
other
sections
as
they
apply
ie
deficiency
in
neuro
as
a
cause
of
neuropathy
deficiency
in
hematology
as
a
cause
of
megaloblastic
anemia
yet
i
sill
hold
the
viewpoint
of
mainstream
medicine
candida
can
cause
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
and
in
already
very
sick
patients
with
damaged
immune
systems
like
aids
and
cancer
patients
systemic
candida
infection
i
think
the
yeast
connection
is
a
bunch
of
hooey
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
how
well
nutrition
is
taught
anyway
here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
well
maybe
im
getting
picky
but
i
always
thought
that
a
yeast
was
one
form
that
a
fungus
could
exist
in
the
other
being
the
mold
form
many
fungi
can
occur
as
either
yeasts
or
molds
depending
on
environment
candida
exibits
what
is
known
as
reverse
dimorphism
it
exists
as
a
mold
in
the
tissues
but
exists
as
a
yeast
in
the
environment
should
we
maybe
call
it
a
mold
infection
a
fungus
infection
maybe
we
should
say
it
is
caused
by
a
moldlike

ask

of

you

still
opt

do

than
a
circumcised
kids
not
so
much
that
the
foreskin
is

isnt

because

doesnt

i
am

however
that
he
will
be
able

handle

my

she

so
in
any

do
not

anything
with

ill
agree
with
your

while
i
was
a
student
i
had
doctors
remove
rather
surprising
amounts
of
wax
from
my
ears
by
flushing
them
out
a
couple
times
usually
because
they
were
examining
my
ears
for
some
other
reason
and
said
something
like
gee
youve
got
a
lot
of
wax
in
there
in
my
case
removal
of
these
large
wax
buildups
did
noticeably
improve
my
hearing
and
ive
since
gotten
in
the
same
habit
as
your
wife
of
flushing
them
out
with
warm
water
from
a
little
rubber
bulb
every
few
months
you
can
buy
little
bulbs
together
with
ear
drops
for
this
express
purpose
from
the
drug
store
i
dont
notice
that
the
drops
accomplish
much
of
anything
one
question
i
do
have
a
doctor
who
flushed
out
my
ears
once
also
advocated
a
drop
of
rubbing
alcohol
in

afterwards
to
flush
out
any
remaining
trapped
water
said
he
told
swimmers
to
do
this

it
works

viewed
as
a
nondisease
by
so
many
in
the
medical
profession
case
western
reserve
med
school
teaches
nutrition
in
its
own
section
as
well
as
covering
it
in
other
sections
as
they
apply
ie
deficiency
in
neuro
as
a
cause
of
neuropathy
deficiency
in
hematology
as
a
cause
of
megaloblastic
anemia
yet
i
sill
hold
the
viewpoint
of
mainstream
medicine
candida
can
cause
mucocutaneous
candidiasis
and
in
already
very
sick
patients
with
damaged
immune
systems
like
aids
and
cancer
patients
systemic
candida
infection
i
think
the
yeast
connection
is
a
bunch
of
hooey
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
how
well
nutrition
is
taught
anyway
elisabeth
lets
set
the
record
straight
for
the
nth
time
i
have
not
read
the
yeast
connection
so
anything
that
i
say
is
not
due
to
brainwashing
by
this
hated
book
its
okay
i
guess
to
hate
the
book
by
why
hate
me
elisabeth
im
going
to
quote
from
zinssers
microbiology
edition
a
book
that
you
should
be
familiar
with
and
not
hate
candida
species
colonize
the
mucosal
surfaces
of
all
humans
during
birth
or
shortly
thereafter
the
risk
of
endogenous
infection
is
clearly
ever
present
indeed
candidiasis
occurs
worldwide
and
is
the
most
common
systemic
mycosis
neutrophils
play
the
main
role
in
preventing
a
systemic
infectioncandidiasis
so
you
would
have
to
have
a
low
neutrophil
count
or
sick
neutrophils
to
see
a
systemic
infection
poor
diet
and
persistent
parasitic
infestation
set
many
third
world
residents
up
for
candidiasis
your
assessment
of
candidiasis
in
the
us
is
correct
and
i
do
not
dispute
it
what
i
posted
was
a
discussion
of
candida
blooms
without
systemic
infection
these
blooms
would
be
responsible
for
local
sites
of
irritation
gi
tract
mouth
vagina
and
sinus
cavity
knocking
down
the
bacterial
competition
for
candida
was
proposed
as
a
possible
trigger
for
candida
blooms
let
me
quote
from
zinssers
again
however
some
factors
such
as
the
use
of
a
broadspectrum
antibacterial
antibiotic
may
predispose
to
both
mucosal
and
systemic
infections
i
was
addressing
mucosal
infections
i
like
the
term
blooms
better
the
nutrition
course
that
i
teach
covers
this
effect
of
antibiotic
treatment
as
well
as
the
cure
i
guess
that
your
nutrition
course
does
not
too
bad
here
is
a
brief
primer
on
yeast
yeast
infections
as
they
are
commonly
called
are
not
truely
caused
by
yeasts
the
most
common
organism
responsible
for
this
type
of
infection
is
candida
albicans
or
monilia
which
is
actually
a
yeastlike
fungus
well
maybe
im
getting
picky
but
i
always
thought
that
a
yeast
was
one
form
that
a
fungus
could
exist
in
the
other
being
the
mold
form
many
fungi
can
occur
as
either
yeasts
or
molds
depending
on
environment
candida
exibits
what
is
known
as
reverse
dimorphism
it
exists
as
a
mold
in
the
tissues
but
exists
as
a
yeast
in
the
environment
should
we
maybe
call
it
a
mold
infection
a
fungus
infection
maybe
we
should
say
it
is
caused
by
a
moldlike
fungus

candida
is
classifed

as

point
out
it
displays
dimorphism
it
is
capable
of
producing

elisabeth
you

and
that
makes

you
to

its
a

i

you

i
still

a

gven
a

an

is
used
to
track
the
distribution
of
the

wwithin
the

the
tracer
is
usually
given
intravenously

this
means
that
the
physician

his
assistant
will
insert
a

into
a
vein

inject
medicine
into
the

after
a

has

for

the
person
is
scanned
with
an

device
to
detect
high
concentrations
of
the

the
radiologist

doctor
is
looking
for
areas
that
take
up
more
of
the

tracer
or
less
of
it
as
far

the

comes
from

what
the

is
probably
looking
for
are
changes

that
may
have
resulted

this
is
also
why

expectorant
so
i
used
that
anyway
and
the
three
nights
i
used
it
i
fell
asleep
rapidly
and
felt
that
i
got
really
good
quality
sleep
that
is
i
actually
felt
refreshed
the
next
morning
so
i
am
now
trying
to
look
into
both
in
the
literature
and
experimentally
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
since
i
am
presuming
that
it
was
the
antihistamine
that
caused
the
effect
the
antihistamine
in
vicks
formula
is
chloriphenamine
maleate
so
i
bought
some
generic
tablets
of
that
and
tried
one
last
night
and
didnt
notice
any
improvement
i
might
try
one
with
a
little
alcohol
about
beer
to
see
if
it
is
a
synergism
effect
also
library
research
seems
to
show
that
benadryl
is
the
antihistamine
with
the
strongest
sedative
effect
of
what
is
availible
otc
so
i
might
also
buy
a
generic
form
of
that
and
try
that
the
pdr
seems
to
suggest
that
mg
is
a
good
dosage
level
to
try
for
other
medical
information
i
have
allergies
but
rarely
have
an
allergic
reaction
living
in
new
mexico
i
also
have
chronically
dry
eyes
which
get
horrible
if
i
try
to
use
most
underarm
deoderants
i
did
guess
that
my
problem
might
be
caused
by
hypoglycemia
so
i
made
some
changes
in
my
diet
consistent
with
that
and
it
didnt
help
so
i
went
back
to
a
normal
diet
pretty
diverse
also
taking
vitamin
supplements
anyway
i
am
looking
for
advice
for
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
and
if
there
are
any
dangers
of
such
use
seems
safe
to
me
since
they
are
used
chronically
for
allergies
by
millions
i
dont
want
to
try
bzs
because
bz
addiction
seems
to
be
a
serious
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
quality
is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep
quality
i
seem

wake
up
around

id

all

soak
in
a

tub

for
minutes
only
minutes
then
massage

it

you
can

i
will
the
hard
part
will
be
finding

imagine
this
you
worried
you
may
have
a
deadly
disease
and
next
thing
you
know
youre
being
put
into
this
big
scary
machine
without
a
word
of
explanation
about
what
is
going
to
happen
to
you
i
believe
this
is
inexcusable
she
waved
her
hand
as
if
to
say
what
are
you
doing
to
me
and
they
responded
with
annoyance
and
anger
next
they
inserted
or
tried
to
insert
an
iv
catheter
apparently
she
has
a
lot
of
trouble
with
these
and
complained
of
the
pain
the
technician
just
stopped
and
fixed
her
with
a
glare
without
any
words
of
explanation
is
there
anything
i
can
do
about
these
pigs
i
realize
that
these
technicians
do
this
sort
of
job
day
in
and
day
out
and
that
some
patients
can
be
very
irritating
and
uncooperative
but
this
is
simply
no
excuse
their
purpose
for
existing
is
to
help
sick
people
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
this
sort
of
behavior
fortunately
my
friend
is
fine
but
i
imagine
a
large
proportion
of
the
people
who
get
ct
scans
are
not
fine
at
all
they
have
cancer
and
that
sort
of
thing
they
dont
need
this
kind
of
shit
also
since
i
named
the
hospital
involved
i
should
also
point
out
that
neither
she
nor
i
have
any
complaints
about
the
competence
or
compassion
of
any
of
the
other
personnel
at
ncmh
thanks

so
glad

you
posted
your
biological

discussion
ive
been
compared
to
the
famous
robert
mcelwaine
by
some
readers
of
sci

i
didnt
know
how
to
respond
since
i
had
not
seen
one
of
your
postsjust
like
i
havent
read
the
yeast
connection
let
me
just
start
by
stating
that
the
authors
of
the
cold
fusion
papers
of
recent
years
are
now
in
scientific
exilei
believe
that
one
has
actually
left
the
country
scientific
fraud
is
rare
im
still
not
sure
that
if
a
review
of
the
research
notes
of
the
cold
fusion
scientists
actually
proved
fraud
or
just
very
shoddy
experimentation
your
sources
do
not
seem
to
be
research
articles
they
are
more
like
lay
texts
designed
to
pique
human
interest
in
a
subject
areajust
like
the
food
combining
and
life
extension
texts
robert
i
try
to
keep
an
open
mind
but
some
things
i
just
cant
buyone
is
taking
sod
orally
to
prevent
oxidative
damage
in
the
body
your
experiment
if
conducted
by
readers
of
this
news
group
would
prove
that
you
are
rightmore
ash
after
seed
sprouting
than
before
unless
you
use
a
muffle
furnance
and
obtain
a
very
high
temperatureabove
degrees
i
believe
you
will
get
organic
residue
in
the
ash
even
the
residue
in
commercial
incinerators
contains
organic
residue
i
remember
doing
this
kind
of
experiment
in
my
organic
chemistry
couurse
in
college
but
i
couldnt
find
a
temperature
for
mineral
ash
formation
so
im
really
guessing
at
degrees
f
it
may
actually
be
much
higher
the
point
is
that
no
one
in
their
home
could
ever
get
a
high
enough
temperature
to
produce
only
a
mineral
ash
they
also
could
not
measure
the
minerals
so
they
could
only
weigh
the
ash
and
find
out
that
you
appear
to
be
correct
chemical
reactions
abound
in
our
body
in
our
atmosphere
in
our
water
and
in
our
soil
are
these
fusion
reactions
yes
many
of
them
do
involve
fusing
oxygen
nitrogen
and
sulfur
to
both
organics
and
inorganics
do
we
really
have
the
transformation
of
silicone
to
calcium
if
carbon
is
fused
with
silicon
not
in
my
book
robert
silicon
is
the
most
abundant
mineral
on
our
planet
ive
seen
speculation
that
man
could
have
evolved
to
be
a
silicon
based
rather
than
a
carbon
based
lifeform
i
like
reading
science
fiction
as
many
people
do
but
i
know
enough
about
biochemistryand
nutrition
to
be
ablein
most
cases
to
separate
the
fiction
from
the
fact
silicon
may
be
one
of
the
trace
elements
that
turns
out
to
be
essential
in
humans
we
have
several
grams
of
the
stuff
in
our
body
whats
it
doing
there
only
the
lord
knows
right
now
but
i
will
tell
you
what
i
do
know
about
silicon
and
why
as
you
state
it
helps
bone
healingand
it
is
not
because
silicon
is
transformed
into
calcium
almost
all
of
the
silicon
in
the
human
body
is
found
in
the
connective
tissuecollagen
and
elastin
there
have
been
studies
published
which
show
that
the
very
high
silicon
content
in
elastin
may
be
an
important
protective
factor
against
atherosclerosisthe
higher
the
silicon
content
in
elastin
the
more
resistant
the
elastin
is
to
a
an
agerelated
loss
of
elasticity
which
may
play
a
role
in
the
increase
in
blood
pressure
that
is
often
seen
as
part
of
the
ageing
process
in
humans
for
bone
fracture
healing
the
first
step
is
a
collagen
matrix
into
which
calcium
and
phosphate
are
pumped
by
osteoblasts
a
high
level
of
silicon
in
the
diet
seems
to
speed
up
this
matrix
formation
this
first
step
in
the
bone
healing
process
seems
to
be
the
hardest
for
some
people
to
get
going
electriacl
currents
have
been
used
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
matrix
forming
cells
oriented
in
the
right
direction
so
that
the
matrix
can
be
formed
in
the
gapor
gaps
between
the
ends
of
the
broken
bone
a
vitamin
c
deficiency
by
slowing
collagen
formation
as
well
as
causing
the
prodcution
of
defective
collagen
does
slow
down
both
bone
and
wound
healing
zinc
is
also
another
big
player
in
bone
and
wound
healing
and
so
is
siliconin
an
undetermined
role
that
most
likely
involes
matrix
formation
and
not
transformation
of
silicon
to
calcium
for
you
to
take
this
bone
healing
observation
and
use
it
as
proof
that
silicon
is
transformed
into
calcium
is
an
interesting
little
trick
but
robert
i
have
the
same
problem
myself
when
i
read
the
lay
pressand
yes
even
some
scientific

is
the
explanation
reasonable
without
a
very
good
science
knowledge
base
you
and
most
readers

are
flying
blindyou
have
to
take
it
on

because
you
dont
know
any
better
if
the
explanation
seems
to
make
sense
to
me
based
on
my
knowledge
base
im
inclined
to
consider
itthis
usually
means
trying
to
find
other
sources
that
come
to
the
same
conclusion
if
the
idealike
a
candida
bloom
seems
to
make
sense

me
i
tend
to
pursue
it
as
long
as
any
advice
that
im
going
to
give
isnt
going
to
really
mess
somebody
up
if
this
makes
us
kindred

robert
then
i
guess
ill
have
to
live
with
that
label
for
the

have
decided
to
read
my

interesting

i
hope
that
you
saw
the
segment
on

last
night
on

tv
i
cant
remember
the
network
or
his
namelike
many
nights
i
was
on

and
my

was
watching
tv
in
our
den
where
i
have
my
computer
setup
this
neurosurgeon
takes
kids
with
brain
tumors
that
everyone
else
has
given
up
on
and
he
usesunconventional
treatmentshis
own
words
he
says
that
he
has
a

rate
the
one
case
that
i
heard
him
discussing

normally
use

he
was
going

cut
you

complain
about
the
cost
of
the
antifungals
what
do
you
think
the
cost
difference
between
radiation
treatment
and
surgery
is
guys
im
going
to
ask
you
guys
one
more
time
why
blast
a
physician
who
takes
the
chronic
sinus
suffererlike
jon
and
the
chronic
gi
suffererlike
elaine
and
tries
to
help
them
using
unconventional
treatments
treatments
which
do
not
result
in
deathlike
those
that
the
neurosurgeon
uses
is
it
because
candida
blooms
are
not
lifethreatening
while
brain
tumors
are
how
about
quality
of
life
guys
may
the
candida
demon
never
cross
your

it

may

if
there

bz
sleep

antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems

be
better
for

i
have
tried
some

that
also

would

any

advice
for
helping
my

ive
already
tried

antihistamines
have

go

the

well
that

not
that
accurate
people
with
early

hernias
are
felt
to
have
a
congenital

that
promotes
the
formation
of

the
hernias
of
later
life
may
be
more
associated
with
chronic

however
the
risk
of
damage
to
the

without

is
high
enough
that
it
ought

the
risk
of

is

no

the

hi
my
wife
has
aquired
some
thyroidal
sp
deficiency
over
the
past
year
that
gives
symptoms
such
as
needing
much
sleep
coldness
and
proneness
to
gaining
weight
she
has
been
to
a
doctor
and
taken
the
ordinary
tests
and
her
values
were
regarded
as
low
the
doctor
and
my
wife
are
not
very
interested
in
starting
medication
as
this
deactivates
the
gland
giving
lifelong
dependency
to
the
drug
hormone
my
questions
are
has
anyone
hadheard
of
success
in
using
this
approach
her
values
have
been
slowly
but
steadily
sinking
any
comment
on
the
probability
of
improvement
although
the
doctor
has
told
her
to
eat
normally
my
wife
has
dieted
vigorously
to
keep
her
weight
as
she
feels
that
is
part
of
keeping
an
edge
over
the
illnesscondition
may
this
affect
the
treatment
development
there
are
several
different
types
of
thyroid
diseases
which
would
cause
a
hypothyroid
condition
reduction
in
the
output
of
the
thyroid
mainly
thyroxin
except
for
ones
caused
by
infections
the
treatment
is
generally
thyroxin
pills
hypothyroid
conditions
caused
by
infections
usually
disappear
when
the
infection
doesthis
doesnt
sound
like
the
case
with
your
wife
thyroxin
orally
does
shut
down
the
thyroid
through
a
feedback
loop
involving
the
pituitary
i
believe
the
pituitary
thinks
that
the
correct
amount
of
thyroxin
is
being
produced
so
it
doesnt
have
to
tell
the
thyroid
to
produce
more
this
process
is
reversable
i
have
hashimotos
thyroiditis
an
autoimmune
condition
and
was
on
thyroxin
for
approx
mo
when
my
endocrinologist
suggested
i
not
take
the
pills
for
wks
when
i
was
retested
for
thyroxin
levels
they
were
normal
i
still
get
tested
every
because
the
condition
might
reappear
the
pills
are
safe
and
have
very
few
sideaffects
those
mostly
at
beginning
of
treatment
having
a
baby
might
be
a
problem
and
would
at
least
require
closer
monitoring
of
hormone
levels
thyroxin
controls
energy
production
which
explains
sleepiness
coldness
and
weight
gain
there
is
also
water
retention
possibly
around
heart
changes
in
vision
and
coarser
hair
and
skin
among
other
things
i
am
not
a
doctor
so
im
sure
i
mistated
something
but
the
important
thing
is
that
thyroid
problems
are
usually
easily
corrected
and
if
they
arent
corrected
can
cause
problems
in
the
rest
of
the
body
get

second

the
most
important
nutrient
in
the
us
as
far
as
infection
is
concernedvitamin
a
when
vitamin
a
was
originally
discovered
it
was
commonly
referred
to
as
the
antiinfection
vitamin
many
peoplelinus
pauling
being
one
have
decided
to
take
this
title
away
from
vitamin
a
and
give
it
to
vitamin
c
which
ive
already
covered
big
mistakein
my
opinion
vitamin
a
is
also
getting
a
reputation
as
an
anticancer
vitaminwith
good
reason
the
nci
currently
has
numerous
clinical
trials
in
progress
to
see
if
vitamin
a
can
not
only
prevent
cancer
but
cure
it
as
well
its
role
in
both
cancer
and
infection
is
almost
identicalbut
not
quite
vitamin
a
comes
in
two
completely
different
formsretinol
and
betacarotene
retinol
is
the
animal
form
and
its
toxic
betacarotene
is
the
plant
form
and
its
completely
nontoxic
both
retinol
and
beta
carotene
display
good
absorption
in
the
human
gut
if
bile
is
present
the
liver
stores
all
of
your
retinol
and
doles
it
out
for
other
tissues
to
use
by
synthesizing
retinol
binding
proteinrbp
a
normal
human
adult
liver
should
have
to
of
retinol
stored
we
are
born
with
in
our
liver
us
autopsy
has
shown
that
about
of
americans
die
with
the
sameor
less
amount
of
vitamin
a
as
they
were
born
with
if
you
dont
believe
that
nutritional
reserveslike
that
of
retinol
in
the
liver
are
important
then
this
low
vitamin
a
reserve
is
not
going
to
affect
you
but
if
you
believelike
i
do
that
the
nutrient
reserves
are
important
then
there
is
a
problem
with
vitamin
a
in
the
us
the
us
rda
for
vitamin
a
in
an
adult
male
is
re
or
of
vitamin
a
for
adult
feamles
its
re
or
of
vitamin
a
diet
surveys
show
that
most
americans
are
getting
this
amount
of
vitamin
a
either
retinol
or
betacarotene
from
their
diet
but
the
nrcnational
research
council
was
going
to
release
a
new
rda
table
in
that
had
the
rda
for
both
vitamin
a
and
vitamin
c
raisedc
to
per
day
and
a
to
per
day
for
adult
males
that
report
and
its
recommendations
was
killed
why
concern
over
the
increasing
supplementation
was
the
main
reason
rdas
are
set
to
prevent
clinical
disease
not
to
keep
nutrient
reserves
full
many
scientist
in
the
us
feel
that
the
time
has
come
to
move
away
from
the
prevention
of
clinical
pathology
concept
and
move
towards
the
promotion
of
optimum
health
concept
especially
since
we
have
some
very
good
data
now
that
show
that
nutrient
reserves
are
extremely
important
during
periods
of
stress
the
nutritonal
concervatives
won
that
battle
and
a
new
group
of
scientist
were
collected
to
come
out
with
the
rda
list
which
lowered
the
rda
for
several
nutrients
and
moved
the
dietary
guidelines
back
to
where
they
were
when
we
first
started
in
the
enough
to
prevent
clinical
pathology
but
not
enough
to
fill
the
reserves
we
know
from
autopsy
that
only
about
of
americans
have
a
liver
with
a
normal
vitamin
a
to
i
preach
nutrient
reserves
to
my
students
and
tell
them
to
measure
them
in
their
patients
but
for
vitamin
a
only
a
liver
biopsyor
autopsy

will
tell
you
how
much
somebody
has
stored

can
tell
very
easily

someone
has
overfilled

her

that

wallach
md
a

brown
series
book
this
level
of
vitamin
a
in
blood
means
that
medical
attention
is
necessary
due
to
vitamin
a
toxicity
weinsier
and
morgan
take
a
much
more
conservative
approach
to
vitamin
a
toxicity
than
does
wallach
as
you
will
see
later
in
this
post
between
and
you
should
have
plenty
of
warning
that
its
time
to
eliminate
the
retinol
from
your
dietheadache
redness
of
the
skin
hair
loss

i
tell
all
my
students
that
will
use
vitamin
a
in
their
practice
that
they
had
better
monitor
the
serum
retinol
level
and
stop
when
there
are
clear
signs
that
the
liver
is
full
you
will
never
really
know
if
the
patient
needs
the
vitamin
abecause
you
can
not
measure
the
pool
in
liver
but
you
will
always
know
when
its
time
to
stopjust
like
in
those
vitamin
a
for
pms
studies
betacarotene
can
be
taken
to
fill
up
your
liver
with
retinol
and
you
will
never
have
to
worry
about
toxicity
because
the
conversion
of
betacarotene
to
retinol
that
occurs
in
both
your
gut
and
your
liver
will
slow
downstops
in
the
liver
and
slows
down
in
the
gut
when
your
liver
is
full
of
retinol
but
taking
betacarotene
as
the
source
of
retinol
takes
a
very
long
time
to
fill
the
liver
upive
seen
estimates
of
years
if
you
are
in
the
that
only
has
as
much
as
you
were
born
with
in
your
one
other
problem
with
betacarotene
if
you
have
a
zinc
deficit
you
will
not
convert
as
much
betacarotene
to
retinol
in
the
gut
or
the
liver
because
the
enxzyme
that
does
this
conversion
requires
zinc
in
addition
the
release
of
retinol
from
the
liver
is
a
zinc
dependent
process
so
a
zinc
deficit
will
cause
a
vitamin
a
deficit
even
if
your
liver
has
plenty
of
vitamin
a
now
what
does
vitamin
a
do
in
cancer
and
infection
protection
the
body
uses
vitamin
aretinol
for
many
different
things
visionthe
first
to
be
nailed
down
and
where
you
see
overt
clinical
pathology
uses
the
aldehyde
retinal
and
alcoholretinol
form
of
vitamin
a
reproduction
uses
the
retinol
form
and
some
retinal
infection
and
cancer
protection
uses
retinoic
acid
how
do
you
convert
retinolwhich
your
white
blood
cells
and
the
mucosal
cells
get
from
blood
to
retinoic
acid
you
use
enzymes
one
of
which
requires
vitamin
cthis
is
why
pauling
has
tried
to
pull
the
title
of
antiinfection
vitamin
away
from
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
does
play
a
role
in
infectioninterferon
production
for
example
but
its
biggest
role
is
the
conversion
of
retinol
to
retinoic
acid
if
you
increase
your
intake
of
vitamin
c
you
will
increase
your
formation
of
retinoic
acid
but
retinoic
acid
can
not
be
converted
back
to
retinolas
retinal
can
and
once
its
formed
its
used
and
then
lost
to
the
body
this
is
why
the
nrc
group
wanted
to
increase
both
vitamin
c
and
vitamin
a
rdas
most
people
taking
large
amounts
of
vitamin
c
really
think
that
they
are
helping
themselves
if
they
dont
have
much
vitamin
a
in
their
liver
and
they
are
not
also
increasing
their
intake
of
vitamin
a
they
actually
do
themselves
more
harm
than
good
retinoic
acid
functions
in
white
blood
cells
to
promote
antibody
formation
in
the
mucus
membrane
it
is
the
main
factor
in
promoting
good
mucus
production
and
a
good
epithelial
cell
barrier
to
prevent
infectious
agents
from
entering
the
blood
system
the
mucus
membrane
is
referred
to
as
the
first
line
defense
against
infection
for
cancer
retinoic
acid
has
been
shown
to
act
as
a
cell
brakeit
counteracts
the
effect
of
cell
promoters
which
stimulate
cells
to
divide
cancer
has
two
distinct
steps
dna
alteration
and
cell
promotion
for
cells
that
normally
divide
all
the
time
promoters
are
not
that
important
but
for
lung
and
breast
tissue
which
does
not
normally
divide
promoters
are
real
important
in
the
malignant
process
this
is
the
major
reason
why
the
nci
has
so
many
different
clinical
trials
in
progress
using
retinol
andor
betacarotene
chronic
infectionirritation
of
the
mucus
membranes
is
a
signal
that
vitamin
a
may
not
be
adequate
i
tell
my
students
that
any
patient
who
walks
into
their
office
with
a
complaint
of
chronic
infection
has
to
be
worked
up
for
vitamin
aalong
with
the
other
factors
that
medicine
already
has
on
its
list
of
causes
for
chronic
infection
i
drive
this
home
in
my
course
at
the
osteopathic
college

i

dark

is
the
best
clinical
test
for

the

what
do

have
to
say
about

are
excerpts
from
their
book

which
has

activity
in

and
in

diferentiation
but
not
in

the
most
common
procedure
to
evaluate

is
to
measure
the
retinol
level
in

the
normal

dark

tests

measurements
are
also
useful
but
difficult

perform
on
young

a
daily

in

for

but
do
not
discuss

for

their
toxic
serum
retinol

is
very
conservative
i
recommend
that
my
students
try
in
adults
that
are
having
problems
with
chronic
infection
they
have
to
rule
out
a
zinc
deficit
first
by
getting
an
rbc
zinc
runor
if
their
clinical
lab
cant
run
it
i
tell
them
to
do
what
weinsier
and
morgan
suggest
give
them
the
zinc
along
with
the
vitamin
a
at
per
day
toxicity
should
not
be
a
problem
and
you
will
not
have
to
worry
about
pulling
the
patient
into
the
office
on
a
regular
basis
to
run
a
serum
retinol
both
elaine
and
jon
found
doctors
who
used
a
much
higher
dose
of
vitamin
a
recall
that
the
pms
papers
were
using
to
of
vitamin
a
i
dont
suggest
that
my
students
use
these
high
doses
if
you
wanted
to
fill
the
liver
up
fastas
part
of
a
clinical
trial
and
were
monitoring
the
serum
retinol
level
then
you
would
be
okay
but
my
knowledge
of
the
vitamin
a
literature
suggests
to
me
that
for
patients
with
a
demonstrated
vitamin
a
deficitdark
adapatation
test
or
serum
retinol
will
provide
a
good
and
steady
improvementas
long
as
zinc
and
vitamin
c
status
are
good
without
having
to
worry
about
toxicity
if
they
want
to
get
more
agressive
fine
if
they
follow
my
advise
to
check
the
serum
retinol
but
vitamin
aretinol
should
never
be
given
in
high
dose
to
women
who
could
become
pregnant
since
vitamin
a
shows
teratogenicity
towards
the
human
fetus
the
dose
needed
to
show
this
effect
on
the
developing
fetus
is
of
retinol
per
day
betacarotene
will
never
have
this
effect
on
the
human
fetus
could
just
taking
betacarotene
instead
of
retinol
supplements
help
yes
but
the
effect
will
take
a
long
time
to
develop
my
advise
is
to
use
retinol
to
fill
the
liver
up
and
then
switch
to
betacarotene
to
keep
it
full
vitamin
a
is
probably
one
nutrient
that
is
better
off
left
to
prescription
by
doctors
but
when
we
have
the
mds
in
this
newsgroup
jumping
all
over
me
and
other
doctors
that
propose
the
use
of
vitamin
a
supplements
for
treating
patients
with
chronic
sinus
and
gi
distress
i
think
that
the
most
prudent
option
is
to
keep
vitamin
a
in
the
otc
market
but
require
manufactors
to
provide
package
inserts
to
educate

seeking
info
on
retinal
detachment
i
am
quite
near
sighted
ive
recently
received
laser
treatment
for
both
eyes
to
seal
holes
in
the
retinas
to
help
prevent
retinal
detachment
in
my
left
eye
a
small
detachment
had
begun
already
and
apparently
the
laser
was
used
to
weld
this
back
in
place
as
well
my
right
eye
seems
fine
in
my
left
eye
i
was
seeing
occasional
flashes
of
bright
light
prior
to
the
treatment
since
the
treatment
two
weeks
these
flashes
are
now
occuring
more
often
several
each
hour
the
opthamologist
explained
the
flashes
are
caused
because
the
vitreous
body
has
attached
to
the
retina
and
is
pulling
on
it
he
says
this
is
not
treatable
and
he
hopes
it
may
go
away
on
its
own
accord
if
it
tugs
enough
i
may
well
face
retinal
detachment
i
am
seeking
via
scimed
additional
info
on
retinal
detachments
the
dr
did
not
wish
to
spend
much
time
with
me
in
explanations
so
i
appreciate
any
further
details
anyone
can
provide
of
most
interest
to
me
if
my
retina
does
detach
what
should
be
my
immediate
course
of
action
if
conventional
surgery
is
need
to
repair
the
detachment
what
is
the
procedure
like
and
what
kind
of
vision
can
i
expect
afterwards
do
the
symptoms
fairly
frequent
flashes
imply
that
detachment
maybe
near
at
hand
or
is
this
not
necessarily
cause
for

be
a
serious
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
quality
is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep
quality
i
seem
to
wake
up
around
or
so
and
be
in
some
kind
of
mental
haze
until
or
also
i
would
be
interested
in
any
other
advice
for
helping
my
problem
although
ive
already
tried
many
of
the
nonpharmacological
solutions
well
i
think
you
might
want
to
visit
a
doctor
who
is
familiar
with
sleep
disturbances
because
antihistamines
only
help
induce
sleep
when
theyre
used
intermittently
they
lose
their
sedative
effect
if
theyre
used
on
a
nightly
basis
their
anticholinergic
effects
drying
of
secretions
relaxing
effects
on
smooth
muscle
can
be
problematic
in
some
people
such
as
those
with
glaucoma
or
prostate
enlargement
antihistamines
like
diphenhydramine
benadryl
or
doxylamine
unisom
are
potent
sedatives
which
are
useful
occasionally
chlorpheniramine
chlortrimeton
is
said
to
be
less
sedative
but
seems
to
work
well
in
some
people
both
chlorpheniramine
and
doxylamine
have
long
halflives
compared
to
diphenhydramine
and
so
may
produce
a
residual
hangover
or
drugged
feeling
the
next
morning

the

its

the

plus
its
cheap
taking
thyroid

does
cause
your

to
reduce
its
own

of
the

but
thats
a
feature
not
a
bug
and
its
irrelevant
in
any
case
in
the
face
of
hypothyroidism
because
her
problem
that
her
gland
isnt
producing
enough
there
isnt
a
clinical
phenomenon
of
thyroid
insufficiency
caused
by
a
sudden
discontinuation
of

thyroid
hormone
analogous
to
adrenal
insufficiency
caused
by
the

re
chromium

in
article
writes
there
is
no
data
to
show
chromium
is
effective
in
promoting
weight
loss
the
few
studies
that
have
been
done
using
chromium
have
been
very
flawed
and
inher
ently
biased
the
investigators
were
making
money
from
marketing
it
theoretically
it
really
doesnt
make
sense
either
the
claim
is
that
chromium
will
increase
muscle
mass
and
decrease
fat
of
course
chromium
is
also
used
t
o
cure
diabetes
high
blood
pressure
and
increase
muscle
mass
in
athletesjust
as
well
as
anabolic
steroids
sounds
like
snake
oil
for
the
where
are
your
references
i
have
been
unable
to
find
studies
that
state
that
chromium
cures
diabetese
it
can
reduce
the
amount
of
insulin
you
have
to
take
high
blood
pressure
i
have
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
anabolic
steroids
i
have
also
never
heard
of
this
claim
before
sounds
like
you
are
making
things
up
and
stretching
the
truth
for
god
knows
what
reason
did
somebody
piss
you
off
at
one
time
on
the
other
hand
it
really
cant
hurt
you
anywhere
but
your
wallet
and
place
bo
effects
of
anything
can
be
pretty
dramatic
i
agree
with
you
that
chromium
picolinate
by
itself
isnt
likely
to
make
a
fat
person
thin
but
it
can
be
the
decisive
component
of
an
overall
strategy
for
longterm
weight
control
and
make
an
important
contribution
to
good
health
it
is
important
to
exercise
and
also
avoid
fat
calories
chromium
picolinate
has
shown
to
reduce
fat
and
increase
lean
muscle
i
will
not
bore
you
with
the
statistics
you
wouldnt
believe
these
anyway
chromium
picolinate
is
an
exceptionally
bioactive
source
of
the
essential
mineral
chromium
chromium
plays
a
vital
role
in
sensitizing
the
bodys
tissues
to
the
hormone
insulin
weight
gain
in
the
form
of
fat
tends
to
impair
sensitivity
to
insulin
and
thus
in
turn
makes
it
harder
to
lose
weight
insulin
directly
stimulates
protein
synthesis
and
retards
protein
breakdown
in
muscles
this
protein
sparing
effect
of
insulin
tends
to
decline
during
low
calorie
diets
as
insulin
levels
decline
which
results
in
loss
of
muscle
and
organ
tissue
by
sensitizing
muscle
to
insulin
chromium
picolinate
helps
to
preserve
muscle
in
dieters
so
that
they
burn
more
fat
and
less
muscle
preservation
of
lean
body
mass
has
an
important
longterm
positive
effect
on
metabolic
rate
helping
dieters
keep
off
the
fat
theyve
lost
chromium
picolinate
promotes
efficient
metabolism
by
aiding
the
thermogenic
heat
producing
effects
of
insulin
insulin
levels
serve
as
a
rough
index
of
the
availability
of
food
calories
so
its
not
at
all
surprising
that
insulin
stimulates
metabolism
note
that
i
did
not
say
that
chromium
picolinate
increases
metabolism
in
summary
you
need
to
change
your
life
style
in
order
to
loose
weight
and
stay
healthy
a
reduce
dietary
fat
consumption
to
no

my

can
be
deadly
if

he
suggested
something
like
of
the
nighttime

would
do
someone
in
being
a
normal
user
of
nyquil
i
checked
the
ingredients
and
have
a
very

believing
it
they
are
g
acetaminophen
mg
pseudoephedrine
hcl
mg
dextromethorphan
hbr
mg
doxylamine

can
someone
settle
our
bet
a
package
of
nyquil
of
course
what
effect
would
of
these
babies
have
the
acetaminophen
is
the
agent
of
concern
in
overdose
of
this
otc
medication
a
single
dose
of
acetaminophen
of
grams
or
greater
can
cause
hepatotoxicity
and
doses
of
grams
or
more
are
potentially
fatal
from
hepatic
necrosis
if
i
recall
correctly
the
metabolism
of
acetaminophen
at
high
doses
involves
nhydroxylation
to
nacetylbenzoquinoneimine
which
is
a
highly
reactive
intermediate
which
then
reacts
with
sulfhydryl
groups
of
proteins
and
glutathione
when
hepatic
glutathione
is
used
up
this
intermediate
then
starts
attacking
the
hepatic
proteins
with
resulting
hepatic
necrosis
the
insidious
part
of
acetaminophen
toxicity
is
the
delay
days
between
ingestion
and
clinical
signs
of
liver
damage
this
is
not
a
nice
way
to
die
as
to
taking
of
these
tablets
that
comes
to
grams
of
acetaminophen
in
a
normal
adult
this
would
probably
cause
nausea
vomiting
abdominal
pain
and
loss
of
appetite

the

inject

prevent

with

come

i

what

can

glaucoma
is
the
classic

there
are

the

onto
the
irises
of
the

by
looking
at
the
patterns
striations
and
occasional
blobs
in
the
irises
you
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
diagnose
illnesses
all
over
the
body
the
two
questions
to
ask
any
alternative
therapist
are
how
does
it
work
what
evidence
is
there
the
answer
to
question
takes
a
little
knowledge
of
medicine
to
evaluate
i
dont
know
about
iridology
but
ive
read
a
book
on
reflexology
which
is
a
remarkably
similar
notion
except
that
the
organs
of
the
body
are
mapped
onto
the
soles
of
the
feet
there
are
supposed
to
be
channels
running
down
the
body
carrying
information
or
energy
of
some
sort
anatomists
have
found
no
such
structures
always
beware
the
words
channel
and
energy
in
any
spiel
put
out
by
an
alternative
practitioner
the
answer
to
question
is
rather
simpler
if
all
they
have
is
anecdotal
evidence
then
forget
it
ask
for
referreed
papers
in
mainstream
medical
journals
ignore
any
bull
about
the
conspiracy
of
rich
doctors
suppressing
alternative
practitioners
studies
are
done
and
papers
are
published
some
of
them
are
even
positive
the
word
licensed
in
the
flyer
is
an
interesting
one
licensed
by
whom
for
what
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
herbology
is
real
and
requires
a
license
you
can
kill
someone
by
giving
them
the
wrong
plants
to
eat
and
many
plants
contain
very
powerful
drugs
foxglove
and
willow
spring
to
mind
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
license
extends
to
the
iridology
and
i
suspect
that
if
you
ask
you
will
be
told
that
it
means
licensed
herbologist
and
iridologist
btw
the
usual
term
is
herbalist
why
use
a
different
word

re

and

hello
i
heard
that
a
certain
disease
toxoplasmosys
is
transmitted
by
cats
which
can
harm
the
unborn
fetus
does
anybody
know
about
it
is
it
a
problem
to
have
a
cat
in
the
same
apartment
see
the
recpetscats
faq
or
any
doctor
or
vet
for
more
information
i
am
not
any
of
the
above
but
we
do
have
a
couple
of
cats
it
is
transmitted
through
the
fecal
matter
so
a
pregnant
woman
should
avoid
cleaning
the
cat
tray
and
you
should
both
wash
hands
before
preparing
or
eating
meals
the
latter
is
sound
advice
at
any
time
of
course
apart
from
that
its
no
great
problem
you
certainly
do
not
need
to
get
rid

to

implies
that
the

generally
leads

failure
at

very
minimum
the
patient
has
persistently
elevated

enzymes
what
some

transaminitis
chronic
persistant

simply

that
the

can

infection
but
shows
no
evidence
of
progressive
disease

a

collection

historical
books
on

on

topic

massage
this
is
a
recurring
theme
ordinary
massage
is
intended
to
make
a
person
feel
better
especially
if
they
have
muscular
or
joint
problems
but
like
chiropracty
there
are
some
practitioners

the
technique
to
a

extreme
invoking
what
seems
to
me
to
be
quack
science
to
justify
their
technique
in
the
case
of
massage
there
is
a
technique
called
deep
abdominal
massage
in
which
the
masseur
is
literally
attempting
to
massage
the
intestines
the
notion
is
that
undigested
food
adheres
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
intestines
and
putrifies
releasing
poisons
which
cause
various

is
to
stand
still

not
wave
my

ive
got
some
painful
stings
when
trying

follow
that
advice
i
have
also
tried

use
hygienic

to
no

they
still
love
me

come
for

even

only
two

can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
the
difference
between
a
persistent

and
a
chronic
one
for
example
persistent
hepatitis
vs
chronic
hepatitis
i
dont
think
there
is
a
general
distinction
rather
there
are
two
classes
of
chronic
hepatitis
chronic
active
hepatitis
and
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
i
cant
think
of
any
other
disease
where
the
term
persistent
is
used
with
or
in
preference
to
chronic
much
as
these
two
terms
chronic
active
and
chronic
persistent
sound
fuzzy
the
actual
distinction
between
the
two
conditions
is
often
fairly
fuzzy
as
well
i
beg
to
differ
chronic
active
hepatitis
implies
that
the
disease
remains
active
and
generally
leads
to
liver
failure
at
the
very
minimum
the
patient
has
persistently
elevated
liver
enzymes
what
some
call
transaminitis
chronic
persistant
hepatitis
simply
means
that
the
patient
has
hbsag
in
hisher
blood
and
can
transmit
the
infection
but
shows
no
evidence
of
progressive
disease
if
i
had
to
choose
id
much
rather
have
the
persistant
type
being
a
chronic
hbsag
carrier
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
patient
has
chronic
persistent
anything
persons
who
are
chronic
carriers
may
have
no
clinical
biochemical
or
histologic
evidence
of
liver
disease
or
they
may
have
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
chronic
active
hepatitis
cirrhosis
or
hepatocellular
carcinoma
most
cases
of
chronic
persistent
hepatitis
cph
are
probably
the
result
of
a
viral
infection
although
in
a
good
number
of
cases
the
cause
cannot
be
determined
the
diagnosis
of
cph
is
made
on
the
basis
of
liver
biopsy
it
consists
of
findings
of
portal
inflammation
an
intact
periportal
limiting
plate
and
on
occasion
isolated
foci
of
intralobular
necrosis
but
in
contrast
to
chronic
active
hepatitis
cah
there
is
no
periportal
inflammation
bridging
necrosis
or
fibrosis
cph
has
indeed
an
excellent
prognosis
if
i
had
to
choose
between
cah
and
cph
there
is
no
question
i
would
also
choose
cph
however
as
david
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
not
as
neat
as
some
of
us
would
have
it
the
histology
can
sometimes
be
pretty
equivocal
with
biopsies
showing
areas
compatible
with
both
cph
and
cah
maybe
it
is
a
sampling

maybe
it
is
a
continuum

george

ive
got
a
very
nice
collection
of
historical
books
on
medical
quackery
and
on
the
topic
of
massage
this
is
a
recurring
theme
ordinary
massage
is
intended
to
make
a
person
feel
better
especially
if
they
have
muscular
or
joint
problems
but
like
chiropracty
there
are
some
practitioners
who
take
the
technique
to
a
far
extreme
invoking
what
seems
to
me
to
be
quack
science
to
justify
their
technique
in
the
case
of
massage
there
is
a
technique
called
deep
abdominal
massage
in
which
the
masseur
is
literally
attempting
to
massage
the
intestines
the
notion
is
that
undigested
food
adheres
to
the
inner
surface
of
the
intestines
and
putrifies
releasing
poisons
which
cause
various
disease
syndromes
by
this
vigorous
and
painful
procedure
it
is
alleged
that
these
deposits
can
be
loosened
up
and
passed
out
i
just
cant
believe
this
idea
has
any
truth
behind
it
the
human
intestine
is
not
a
new
york
city
sewer
pipe
and
even
if
it
were
you
eat
half
of

aint

pointed

decided

there
had

be

he
saw
the

as
being
worse
than
the

through

years

metabolism
of

involves
nhydroxylation

is
a

then

hello
all
there
is
a
small

a

i
would
appreciate
any
help
at
all
with
it
my
friend
has
been
diagnosed
as
having
a
severe
case
of
depression
requiring
antidepressants
for
a
cure
the
main
problem
is
the
side
effects
of
these
so
far
she
has
been
prescribed
prozac
aurorix
and
tryptanol
all
with
different
but
unbearable
side
effects
the
prozac
gave
very
bad
anxietyjitters
and
insomina
it
was
impossible
to
sit
still
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
the
aurorix
whilst
having
a
calming
effect
all
feelings
were
lost
and
the
body
coordination
was
similar
to
a
drunken
person
her
brain
was
clouded
over
the
tryptanol
gave
tremors
in
the
legs
and
panic
attacks
along
with
unco
ordination
occurred
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
as
her
brain
was
closed
down
has
anyone
had
similar
problems
andor
have
any
suggestions
as
to
the
next
step

cph
has
indeed
an
excellent
prognosis
if
i
had
to
choose
between
cah
and
cph
there
is
no
question
i
would
also
choose
cph
however
as
david
pointed
out
the
distinction
between
the
two
is
not
as
neat
as
some
of
us
would
have
it
the
histology
can
sometimes
be
pretty
equivocal
with
biopsies
showing
areas
compatible
with
both
cph
and
cah
maybe
it
is
a
sampling
problem
maybe
it
is
a
continuum
i
dont
know
darn
just
when
i
think
i
understand
something
someone
who
knows
the
pathology
has
to
burst
my
bubble
wed
better
not
start
talking
about
glomerular
diseases
then
ill
really
get
depressed
seriously
though
i
wonder
how
someone
with
cph
would
end
up
getting
a
biopsy
in
the
first
place
my
understanding
and
feel
free
to
correct
me
is
that
the
enzymes
are
at
worst
mildly
elevated
with
overall
normal
hepatic
function
i
would
think
that
the
only
clue
might
be
a
history
of
prior
hepb
infection
and
a
positive
hepbsag
or
is
it
indeed
on
a
continuum
with
cah
and
the
distinction
merely
one
of
pathology
and
prognosis
but
otherwise
identical
clinical
features

i

a

had

no

i
probably
could
have

with

if
the

had

it

maybe
because

im
seeing
a

who
has
put
me
on
zoloft
another
serotonin

inhibitor
like
prozac
one
pillday
seemed
to
help
some
now
im
trying
zoloft
has
fewer
and
milder
side

than
prozac
i
think
my
doctor
said
that
only
of
the
people
taking
zoloft
have
to
discontinue
it
because
of
side

the
only
problem
im

is
some
minor

nothing
too
annoying
hopefully
the
zoloft
will
work

your

should
try
this
one
next
my
psychiatrists
strategy
seems
to
be
to
first
try
one
of
the
serotonin
drugs
usually
prozac
if
that
works
great
if
it
works
but
has
too
many
side
effects
try
zoloft
or
maybe
paxil
if
the
serotonin
drugs
dont
work
at
all
try
one
of
the
tricyclics
like
desipramine
suggestions
as
to
the
next
step
having
a
doctor
who
knows
something
about

can

health
effects
of
this

is
a
very
hotly
debated
topic
in
the
medical
community
with
most
physicians
seeming
to
discount
any
health
effects
of
chronic
antibiotic
use
a
view
that
i
do
not
support
how
does
one
tell
if
a

is
more
susceptible
to
illness
than
normal
and
what
does
one
do
about
it
chronic
infection
in
an
adult
or
a
child
needs
to
be
worked
up
in
my
opinion
but
most
physicians
feel
that
chronic
infection
in
a
child
is
normal
because
of
both
exposure
and
lack
of
prior
immunity
to
many
infectious
diseases
i
do
not
share
this
view
and
there
are
some
physicians
who
also
suspect
that
diet
plays
a
big
role
in
infection
frequency
and
severity
exposure
to
an
infectious
agent
does
not
have
to
result
in
a
severe
infection
a
strong
immune
response
can
minimize
the
length
of
time
needed
to
deal
with
the
infection
as
well
as
the
symptoms
associated
with
the
infection
is
there
any
way
to
build
immunity
and
resistance
there
are
five
major
nutrients
that
are
responsible
for
a
good
strong
immune
response
to
infectious
agents
they
are
protein
vitamin
c
vitamin
a
iron
and
zinc
the
american
diet
is
not
low
in
protein
so
this
is
rarely
a
problem
but
vitamin
a
vitamin
c
iron
and
zinc
are

and
this

these
five
nutrients
and
their
role
in

for
this

group
as
well
as
the
others
that
i
participate
in
i
can
email
you
what
ive
worked
up
so
far
but
my
best
advice
to
you
is
to
try
to
find
a
physician
who
recognizes
the
critical
role
that
diet
plays
in
the
human
immune
response
you
may
also
be
able
to
get
help
from
a
nutritionist
anyone
can
call
themselves
a
nutritionist
so
you
have
to
be
very
carefull
you
want
to
find
someone
like
myself
who
has
had
some
formal
training
and
education
in
nutrition
many
phd
programs
in
the
us
now
offer
degrees
in
nutrition
and
thats
what
you
need
to
look
for
some
dieticians
will
also
call
themselves
nutritionists
but
most
dieticians
have
not
had
the
biochemical
training
needed
to
run
specialized
nutritional
assessment
tests
they
are
very
good
for
getting
general
dietary
advice
from
however
any
data
information
or
advice
relating
to
this
would
be
much
appreciated

the

the

and
he
did

it
seems
like
he
has
some
sort
of
cold

flu
pretty
much
once
a

most
of
the

the

leads
to
an

as
well
with
the

that
he
ends
up
being
on

weeks
out
of
i
know
kids
in

fall
sick
more
often
but
we
sounds
pretty
familiar
i
posted
similar
cries
about
last
september
when
caroline
just
entered
daycare
she
was
two
then
and
have
been
with
continuous
colds
since
until
last
march
as
spring
approaches
her
colds
slowed
down
meanwhile
we
grew
more
and
more
relaxed
about
her
colds
only
once
did
the
doctor
diagnosed
an
ear
infection
and
only
twice
she
had
antibiotics
the
other
time
was
due
to
sinus
infection
and
i
wished
that
i
did
not
give
her
that
awful

are
there
any
studies
that
can
help
answer
some
of
these
questions
there
are
the
net
studies
that
is
if
you
read
this
newsgroup
often
there
will
be
a
round
of
questions
like
this
every
month
there
might
be
formal
studies
like
that
but
bear
with
my
not
so
academic
experience
okay
how
often
do
kids
in
their
first
second
and
third
years
fall
sick
how
often
do
they
get
colds
flus
ear
infections
gee
i
bet
youll
hear
cases
in
all
these
catagories
is
there
any
data
on
home
care
vs
day
care
i
am
pretty
sure
an
insulated
child
at
home
sicks
less
but
that
child
still
will
face
the
world
one
day
does
being
sick
build
immunity
leading
to
less
illness
later
thats
what
i
believe
and
comfort
myself
with
caroline
will
get
more
and
more
colds
for
sure
before
she
learned
not
to
stick
her
hand
in
other
kids
mouth
nor
let
other
kids
do
the
same
cold
virus
mutate
easily
however
i
hope
that
her
immune
system
will
be
stronger
to
fight
these
diseases
so
she
would
be
less
severely
affected
everytime
she
has
a
cold
we
make
sure
she
blow
her
nose
frequently
and
give
her
dorcol
or
dimetapp
at
night
so
she
can
have
good
rest
thanks
to
some
suggestions
from
the
net
thats
about
all
the
care
she
needs
from
us
i
try
very
hard
to
keep
her
off
antibiotics
twice
her
ped
gave
me
choice
to
decide
whether
she
would
have
antibiotics
i
waited
just
long
enough
days
to
see
that
she
fought
the
illness
off
i
do
understand
that
you
dont
have
much
choice
if
the
child
is
in
pain
andor
high
fever
does
it
make
kids
weaker
leading
to
more
illness
later
or
does
it
not
have
any
long
term
effect
if
the
child
doesnt
rely
on
antibiotics
to
fight
off
the
sickness
everytime
then
the
child
should
be
stronger
does
taking
antibiotics
on
a
regular
basis
have
any
negative
long
term
effects
ill
leave
this
to
expert
how
does
one
tell
if
a

is
more
susceptible
to
illness
than
normal
and
what
does
one
do
about

if

just

im
pretty

the

will
be

hi
all
my
skin
is

in
general

the
most
serious
part
is
located
from
knees
down
the
skin
there
looks
like
segmented
the
segmentation
actually
happens
beneath
the
skin
i
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
any
cure
for
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
just
saw
a
dermatologist
the
other
day
and
while
i
was
there
i
asked
him
about
dry
skin
id
been
spending
a
small
fortune
on
various
creams
lotions
and
other
dry
skin
treatments
he
said
all
i
needed
was
a
large
jar
of
vaseline
soak
in
a
lukewarm
tub
of
water
for
minutes
only
minutes
then
massage
in
the
vaseline
to
trap
the
moisture
in
that
is
the
standard
advice
in
dermatology
texts
the
soak
part
greatly
increases
the
inconvenience
dont
bother
unless
it
doesnt
work
otherwise
the
hard
part
will
be
finding
the
time
to
rub
in
the
vaseline
properly
exactly
but
it
adds
to
the
ritual
aspect
which
is
important
for
us
suggestible
patients
posters
dont
bother
to
repeat
the
rationale
for
the
soak
if
its
not
done
right
you
remain
greasy
and
stick
greasy
no
matter
what
vaseline
generically
petrolatum
is
famous
for
that
one
text
states
that
the
more
greasy
a
dryskin
cream
is
the
more
effective
try
it
its
got
to
be
cheaper
then
spending
for
oz
of
natural
lotion
try
usp
lanolin
at
least
for
maintenance
preventive
therapy
usp
lanolin
is
natural
and
much
less
greasy
and
cheap
dont
buy
the
more
expensive
perfumed
lanolin
mixture
as
ive
commented
before
petrolatum
is
a
poorly
characterized
mixture
of
hydrocarbons
which
are
not
found
in
biological
systems
that
is
not
inherently
bad
but

my

started

i
thought
the
concept
was
so
amazing
that
i
bought
one
too
the
thing
works
by
reading

drum
the
ear
drum
is
hotter
than
the
ear
canal
walls
so
you
have
to
point
the
thing
very
carefully
this
means
tugging
on
the
top
of
the
ear
to
straighten
out
the
ear
canal
then
inserting
the
thing
snugly
then
pushing
a
button
unfortunately
there
are
many
things
that
can
go
wrong
it
is
almost
impossible

aim
the
thing
correctly

you
do
it

differ

each
other
by
up

degrees
and
may
differ
from
an
oral

by
up
to
degrees
i
talked
to
one
of
the
nurses
in
my
doctors
office
recently
about
this
and
she
said
she
didnt
like
them
either
for
same
reasons
she
did
give
me
some
instruction
on
how
to
tug
on
my
ear
and
what
correct
insertion
feels
like
but
she
said
she
thought
it
was
impossible
to
do
correctly
on
ones
self
she
also
said
that
she
and
other
nurses
had
complained
to
the
company
about
inaccurate
readings
and
that
someone
from
the
company
had
told
them
to
take
great
care
to
clean
the
infrared
window
at
the
end
of
the
probe
with
alcohol
from
time
to
time
she
demonstrated
this
prior
to
reading
my
temperature
and
managed
to
get
a
reading
within
degree
of
the
oral
temperature
i
took
at
home
before
driving
to
the
drs
office
i
have
also
noticed
tha
some
nurses
click
the
button
then
remove
the
probe
immediately
this
causes
wrong
readings
in
my
experience
you
have
to
leave
the
probe
in
a
good
to
seconds
after
clicking
the
button
to
get
a
good
measurement
the
nurse
i

i
suspect
that
many
people
dont

this
and
therefore
get
bad

for

another

in

im

no

how
gentle

a

i
use
the

was
calories
in

the

wont

i

where

could
they

last
week
i
went
to
see
a
gastroenterologist
i
had
never
met
this
doctor
before
and
she
did
not
know
what
i
was
there
for
as
soon
as
i
arrived
somebody
showed
me
to
an
examining
room
and
handed
me
a
gown
they
told
me
to
undress
from
the
waist
down
to
be
exact
and
wait
for
the
doctor
is
this
the
usual
drill
when
you
go
to
a
doctor
for
the
first
time
i
dont
have
much
experience
going
to
doctors
knock
on
wood
but
on
the
couple
of
occasions
when
ive
gone
to
a
new
doctor
i
met
him
with
my
clothes
on
first
he
introduced
himself
asked
what
i
was
there
for
and
took
a
history
all
before
i
undressed
are
patients
usually
expected
to
get
naked
before
meeting
a
doctor
for
the
first
time
personally
id
prefer
to
meet
the
doctor
on
something
remotely
resembling
a
condition
of
parity
and
to
establish
an
identity
as
a
person
who
wears
clothes
before
dropping
my
drawers
if
nothing
else
it
minimizes
the
time
that
i
have
to
spend
in
the
self
conscious
ill
at
ease
and
vulnerable
condition
of
a
person
with
a
bare
bottom
talking
to
somebody
who
is
fully
clothed
does
anybody
besides
me
regard
this
getnakedfirstandthenwecantalk
attitude
as
insensitive
also
is

chronic
persistent
hepatitis
is
usually
diagnosed
when
someone
does
a
liver
biopsy
on
a
patient
that
has
persistently
elevated
serum
transaminases
months
after
a
bout
of
acute
viral
hepatitis
or
when
someone
is
found
to
have
persistently
elevated
transaminases
on
routine
screening
tests
the
degree
of
elevation
in
the
serum
transaminases
can
be
trivial
or
as
much
as
ten
times
normal
other
blood
chemistries
are
usually
normal
as
a
rule
patients
with
cph
have
no
clinical
signs
of
liver
disease
chronic
active
hepatitis
can
also
be
asymptomatic
or
minimally
symptomatic
at
least
initially
and
thats
why
its
important
to
tell
them
apart
by
means
of
a
biopsy
the
patient
with
cph
only
needs
to
be
reassured
the
patient
with
cah
needs
to
be
treated
i
just
went
back
to
the
chapter
in
cecil
on
chronic
hepatitis
it
seems
that
indeed
most
cases
of
cph
are
persistant
viral
hepatitis
whereas
there
are
a
multitude
of
potential
and
probable
causes
for
cah
viral
drugs
alcohol
autoimmune
etc
physicians
seem
to
have
a
variety
of
thresholds
for
electing
to
biopsy
someones
liver
personally
i
think
that
if
the
patient
is
asymptomatic
with
only
slight
transaminitis
and
normal
albumin
and
pt
one
can
simply
follow
them
closely
and
not
add
the
potential
risks
of
a
biopsy
others
may
well
biopsy
such
a
patient
thus
providing
these
samples
for
study
it
would
be
interesting
to
see

anyones
