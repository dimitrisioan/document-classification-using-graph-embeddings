begin

what
with
our
having

still
alive
drawing

secret

protection
maybe
so

they
were

its
sop
for
retiring

the
point
is
that
they

no

the

no

can

it
the

it

please
mr

or
anyone
show
me
one
case
where
the
us
constitution
or
any
state
constitution
is
considered
a
contract
the
const
is
designed
to
limit
the
powers
of

not
to
bind
the
people
it
is
also
designed

delineate
the

hello
what
the

decision
means
is
that
the
tax
protestors
were
wrong
the
weakness
of
the
governments
legal

is
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
someone

very

blatantly
stack

his

no

i
am
the
first
to
state
that
the
figure
may
be

high
but
it
may
just
be
too
low
depending
on
what
you
are
talking
about
keep
in
mind
that
there
are
practicing
heterosexuals
that
are
actually
gay
these
people
chose
to
take
a
road
that
avoids
being
harassed
and
they
wanted
to
fitin
with
everyone
other
normal
person
but
lets
get
off
of
this
irrational
behavior
of
calling
everyone
a
liar
you
cannot
even
start
to
support
such
claims
also
the
corrupt
criminal
and
lying
nature
of
kinseys
work
which
provides
much
of
the
justification
for
homosexual
rights
in
the
modern

should
make

step
back
for

and
question
the
rest
of
the

that
they

this

you

heterosexuals

anything

lets
extrapolate
this
maybe
if

it

thanks
to
kim
for
following
up
i
was
hoping
that
someone
would
bring
up
the
issue
of
cost
compensation
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
explain
why
kidney
dialysis
rd
services
have
expanded
massively
in
the
last
decade
after
all
no
one
is
forcing
private
providers
to
offer
this
service
if
they
are
losing
money
on
the
treatment
which
according
to
information
ive
collected
from
several
providers
they
are
not
why
would
they
not
simply
limit
their
losses
by
cutting
back
on
services
engage
in
effective
rationing
of
supply
rather
than
expand
the
coverage
to
a
larger
market
that
must
then
be
compensated
by
raising
prices
in
other
areas
perhaps
there
is
a
competitive
advantage
in
there
after
all
would
not
reputable
and
dedicated
physicians
prefer
to
affiliate
with
an
institution
that
offers
dialysis
services
would
they
not
therefore
tend
to
admit
patients
in
greater
numbers
to
an
institution
that
offered
a
full
range
of
diagnostic
and
treatment
options
undoubtedly
in
fact
it
is
the
fact
that
hospitals
frequently
compete
for
physicians
rather
than
for
patients
that
in
part
complicates
and
undermines
a
simplistic
freemarket
analysis
of
the
market
for
medical
care
hospitals
tend
to
lose
money
on
all
sorts
of
hightech
highprice
machinery
they
manage
to
make
it
up
on
other
charges
once
again
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
is
true
in
regard
to
kidney
dialysis
although
price
controls
have
promoted
an
expansion
of
services
to
a
much
greater
volume
of
patients
rd
is
still
a
profitable
service
otherwise
one
would
expect
to
see
evidence
of
rationing
rather
than
the
vast
expansion
that
has
occurred
remember
the
notion
that
you
can
lose
a
little
on
each
treatment
but
make
it
up
in
volume
is
not
good
economics
even
in
a
free
market
then
how
do
you
explain
why
grocery
stores
routinely
offer
an
array
of
products
at
prices
below
cost
are
not
grocery
stores
embedded
in
a
relatively
free
market
can
you
spell
loss
leader
i
knew
you
could
grocery
stores
do
not
attempt
to
make
up
the
loss
on
an
individual
product
by
selling
more
of
it
in
fact
your
argument
above
is
that
kidney
dialysis
is
a
loss
leader
for
other
medical
treatments
where
lost
revenue
can
be
regained
but
the
evidence
does
not
support
this
contention
rather
it
appears
that
price
controls
have
disciplined
the
market
by
forcing
an
expansion
of
service
and
development
of
improved
lowercost
technology
to
provide
comparable
benefits
providers
continue
to
profit
from
rd
they
simply
make
less
on
each
treatment
than
they
would
have
if
the
price
had
risen
at
the
rate
that
uncontrolled
treatments
have
there
is
no
question
that
had
price
controls
forced
the
price
of
rd
substantially
below
its
actual
cost
that
some
or
all
of
the
doomsday
predictions
of
freemarket
advocates
would
have
been
seen
restriction
of
service
lagging
technological
development
etc
likewise
it
appears
that
in
the
va
and
armed
forces
medical
care
systems
where
providers
are
government
agencies
some
of
these
negative
impacts
may
occur
rd
patients
in
the
va
system
in
spokane
for
example
must
travel
to
seattle
miles
away
for
treatment
the
bottom
line
however
is
that
this
is
an
example
of
government
intervention
of
a
rather
extreme
sort
that
appears
to
have
had
beneficial
results
for
both
providers
and
consumers
claims
that
government
bureaucracy
inevitably
leads
to
undesirable
outcomes
in

your

seem
on
the

to
deviate
so
radically
from

that
i
feel
the
burden
of

is
still
on
you
to
show
that
your

have
any
merit
whatsoever
and
the
cases
youve

involve
such
strange
situations
that
i
see
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
rulings
are
applicable
to
anyone
else
or
that
they
will
ultimately
stand
on
appeal
to
the

why
cant
you
just
cite
us
a

in
which
joe
schmoe
a
regular

earning
regular

from
a
regular

refuses
to
pay
his

then
has
his

overturned

ruling

is
indeed
totally
voluntary
what
you

no

hmmm

received
and
the

has
forfeited

with
all
due

you
can

anything
you

just

for

i
confess
im
thoroughly
confused

to
why
you
would
be
looking

anyway
since
i
thought
you

with
big
banking
interests
since
the

coverup
thing
do
you
honestly
expect
us
to
believe
that
theyd
go
to
all
the
trouble
to
subvert
the

and
yet
would
still
promptly
slink
back
into
their
burrows
in
the
face
of
anyone
who
knew
enough
to
invoke
the
right
combination
of
magic
spells
and
mystic
mumbojumbo
not
only
that
but
why
do
you
even
care
what
the
us
courts
say
anyway
didnt
you
tell

a
while
back
that
youve
disavowed

to

why

you

go

where
they

or
maybe
we

all
just

than

there
is
something
that
bothers
me
about
this
whole
arguement
could
someone
please
calmly
explain
why
homosexuality
is
such
a
great
sin
without
giving
the
standard
just
because
god
sez
so
almost
all
of
judeo
thanks
for
your
posting
i
enjoyed
it
the
reason
homosexuality
is
a
sin
is
because
the
jews
were
a
struggling
group
of
people
trying
hard
to
survive
and
differentiate
between
themselves
and
their
oppressors
this
led
to
several
things
worshipping
one
god
all
their
foes
were
polytheistic
all
sex
was
put
in
to
a
moral
context
all
their
foes
were
perverts
and
spilled
their
seed
liberally
its
just
as
easy
to
spill
seed
or
spread
it
thin
heterosexualy
why
then
the
specific
prohibition
on
homosexuals
especially
since
the
answer
to
everything
back
then
was
stoning
to
death
doesnt
help
population
growth
much
also
to
just
say
that
their
foes
were
perverts
begs
the
question
the
key
word
is
spilled
if
semen
was
spilled
anywhere
where
there
was
a
chance
of
procreation
it
was
ok
if
it
was
spilt
on
the
ground
or
in
to
a
man
it
was
a
big
sin
ditto
with
animals
the
jews
said
sexpro
creation
homosexuals
didnt
breed
there
fore
they
are
evil
and
should
be
stoned
to
death
all
sex
was
directed
towards
breeding
the
jews
were
few
in
number
and
their
foes
many
to
survive
everything
had
to
go
into
multiplication
like
i
said
stoning
to
death
doesnt
help
population
much
it
sounds
more
like
a
set
of
prejudices
that
already
existed
and
were
blown
into
a
religion
to
emphasize
the
differences
of
jewish
culture
and
enshrine
some
pretty
stoning
nonbreeding
population
was
fine
only
the
breeders
were
considered
to
be
worth
much

clayton

the

have
gotten
a

passed
in

that
makes
it
illegal
to
discriminate
against
a
person
in

based
on
their

pedophilia
is
a
sexual

got
him
cramer
is
now
claiming
that
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
rather
than
a
chronicly
homosexual
condition
this
changes
the
whole
argument
in
as
much
that
is
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
all
of
its
own
peds
cannot
be
called
homosexual
peds
are
peds
who
may
have
a
preference
as
to
the
sex
of
the
child
they
molest
though
most
do
not
have
a
preference
but
that
is
a
subset
of
their
basic
ped
nature
cramer
has
as
much
as
admitted
that
peds
and
gay
men
are
different
orientations
all
we
need
now
is
to
get
him
to
admit
that
the

unwanted
if
the
behaviour
persists
harrassment
is
much
easier
to
demonstrate
due
to
the
fact
that
the
offender
knew
that
the
behaviour
was
unwanted
no
argument
here
my
original
query
regarded
the
question
of
why
the
first
sexual
proposition
made
by
person
a
to
person
b
would
be
considered
to
be
sexual
harassment
by
somemany
people
assuming
of
course
that
there
does
not
exist
a
power
relationship
between
a
and
b
such
that
the
proposition
carries
strong
implications
of
extortion
right
from
word
one
i
can
only
say
that
those
people
are
wrong
the
word
harass
means
to
irritate
or
torment
persistently
id
hardly
consider
one
time
to
fall
under
the
definition
of
persistent
additionally
there
is
no
basis
to
assume
the
behaviour
is
unwanted
unlike
an
illegal
proposition
of
course
i
think
the
original
question
of
offering
money
for
sex
is
inarguably
harrassment
because
the
activity
is
illegal
and
could
be
presumed
to
be
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
i
have
to
take
issue
with
this
viewpoint
given
that
a
prostitution
is
a
victimless
crime
and
b
there
are
literally
millions
of
americans
who
participate
in
some
sort
of
victimless
activities
which
the
state
has
defined
to
be
criminal
eg
prostitution
obscenity
gambling
using
certain
recreational
drugs
having
nonmercenary
sex
with
persons
not
ones
spouse
in
certain
states
having
unnatural
sex
with
people
regardless
of
marital
status
or
exchange
of
money
in
certain
states
etc
id
have
to
say
that
the
idea
that
an
activity
may
be
presumed
to
be
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
merely
because
it
is
illegal
is
the
sort
of
sophistry
that
only
a
judge
could
indulge
in
with
a
straight
face
he
said
speaking
as
a
law
student
whos
read
his
share
of
judicial
opinions
in
which
reality
was
not
only
denied
but
in
fact
actually
inverted
in
order
to
make
the
universe
conform
to
the
writers
politics
i
was
speaking
from
a
legalistic
viewpoint
what
you
say
is
true
but
the
law
in
order
to
make
what
little
sense
it
manages
to
make
has
to
make
some
assumptions
assuming
that
an
illegal
activity
is
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
i
think
is
reasonable
certainly
i
would
need
a
preponderance
of
evidence
on
the
side
of
the
propositioner
that
there
was
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
proposition
was
welcome
the
number
of
people
who
participate
in
victimless
crimes
notwithstanding
the
fact
reamins
that
under
the
law
the
activity
is
illegal
to
presume
that
the
proposition
is
welcome
simply
because
a
large
number
of
people
indulge
in
it
is
the
type
of
sophistry
only
a
lawyer
could
indulge
in
with

yes
it

who

it
makes

it
appears
both

and
liberals
prefer

cold
war
until
you
win
then
nurse
the

back

for
another
go
around
enemy
sounds
like
thats
the
viewpoint
of
the
stereotypical
rednecked
conservative
always
been
commies
always
will
be
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
oh
btw
germany
has
sure
come
back
as
a
terrible
enemy
after
wwii
hasnt
it
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
cannot
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
cannot
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two

are
aid
to
russia
and
a

someone
else
will
champion

or
doing

that
is
why
we

and
not
a
true

instead
of
gridlock
on

we
only

btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on

just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were

actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for

it

by
a

is
living
his

in
an
attempt
to
vilify
all
men
who

something
slightly
similar

the

his

anything
he
finds

prove
that
there
are

who

little

like
he
was
coming
out
of

there
is
no
hope
for
him
in
all
probability
he
is
secretly
gay
which
compounds
his
neurosis
in
his
own
mind
by
thinking
that
someone
else
made
him
that
way
i
dont
personally
see
how
someone

him
could
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the

time

mentally
crippled

dominated

the

people
who
like
to
do

then
he
will
virtually
assert

everyones
queer

actually
believes

do
some
huge
disproportionate
amount
of
child
sexual
abuse

though
he
insists
that
there
may

in
the

if
there
were

unfortunately
it

if
an

the

to

you
mean

first
agricultural

in

slave
labor
was

to
grow

sugar

well
into

and
of

in

slave

was

of

in

ways
this
treatment
of

is
the
most
horrifying
aspect
of

second

eventually
it

the

capital

used

now
if

then
the

has
now
been
dehumanized
and
is
simply
a
machine
not

for

argument
so
slaves
are
humans
and
they

labor
sorry
the
question
of
defining

is
no
tougher
than
defining
the
labor
of
a

an

or
any
other

both
legally

economically
in

slaves
are
not

they

can
you
provide
some
evidence
that
the
slave
states
regarded
slaves
as
not
humans
they
were
outside
our
society
and
similar
phrases
that
basically
meant
that
they
didnt
have
to
recognized
as
having
the

as

but
they
were
never
considered
not
human
to
my
knowledge
like
a
horse
that
pulls
a
plow
a
slaves
labor
is
the
return
on
the
capital
required
to
purchase
and
feed
him
the
parallel
is
so
obvious
im
not

how
you
missed
it
after
all
its
was
the
liberty
to
use
their

as

fit
that
motivated
southern
planters
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
states
rights
if
that
were
the
case
the

would

the
argument
that

was
a

often
made
by
is
historians
mainly
southerners
who
sought
to
divert
attention
from
the
institution
as
the
central
issue
of
the
civil
war
in
fact
however
the
argument
is
specious
at
best
more
recent
scholarship
from
the
last
years
demonstrates
rather
conclusively
that
the
cottonsugar
tobacco
economy
and
its
reliance
on
slavery
was
increasingly
dominant
in
the
south
prior
to
the
civil
war
this
is
because
the
south
did
not
receive
the
massive
momentum
of
capital
intensive
growth
that
the
northern
states
did
compare
the
northern
agricultural
system
with
the
southern
and
you
will
see
a
major
difference
in
the
capital
to
labor
intensity
capital
and
labor
are
one
and
the

in
a

that

quite
as
readily
as

did
slavery
was
a

before
the

yes

not

that
cotton
suffered
from

depression
in
the
the
period
used
to
claim
that
slavery
would
not
have
lasted
in
the
south
that
is
not
the
argument
that
i
have
heard
it
would
not
have
lasted
because
the
growth
in
the
north
would
not
have
been
sustained
for
much
longer
without
spilling
over
to
the
southern
states
ie
northern
industry
would
have
migrated
capital
to
the
southern
states
and
with
that
would
have
come
immigrant
labor
to
the
ports
of
the
south
eg
charleston
savannah
mobile
new
orleans
etc
this
would
have
put
the
breaks
on
the
slave
market
and
slavery
would
have
been
outmoded
by
the
capital
intensity
of
competing
agriculturalists
those
that
insisted
on
keeping
slaves
because
of
their
cruel
hearts

for
black

anything

it

what
do
you
do
with
them
there
are
three
options
kill
those
who
are
not
productive
as
a
drain
upon
society
this
is
the
communist
all
who
do
not
toil
shall
not
eat
lenin
or
fascist
approach
youre
being
too
generous
to
the
communists
i
think
in
practice
communism
has
solved
the
problem
by
killing
off
anybody
who
is
too
productive
and
who
therefore
raises
embarrassing
questions
about
why
the
rest
of
the
group
is
a
bunch
of
sluggards
the
mass
butchery
of
kulaks
in
the
ussr
is
a
good
instance
of
this
a
poor
second
best
is
to
have
a
neighboring
capitalist
country
to
which
people
of
politically
incorrect
skill
and
ambition
flee
i
often
wonder
just
what
castro
would
have
done
if
the
cubans
presently
in
miami
would
have
been
forced
to
remain
in
cuba
would
they
have
revolted
and
killed
him
off
or
been
killed
best
of
all
is
to
build
a
wall
locking
the
citizens
of
your
country
in
load
it
up
so
heavily
with
attack
dogs
barbed
wire
and
land
mines
that
most
people
fleeing
over
it
die
and
then
give
everyone
the
choice
of
obedience
prison
or
flight
this
would
be
a
bad
sciencefiction
novel
if
the
east
germans
hadnt
actually
done
it
the
last
person
to
die
crossing
the
wall
as
i
recall
was
an
unarmed
woman
who
was
shot
in
the
back
erich
honecker
was
going
to
go
on
trial
for
that
but
he
fled
to
socialists
in
chile
its
good
to
be
kind
to
ones
intellectual
opponents
but
sometimes
its
a
sheer
waste
of

we
are

the

michael
is
not
entirely
correct
in
his

that
because
members
of
our

made
great
advances
the
race

as
a
whole
deserve
more

than
they
receive
white

do
deserve

better
than
they
are

but
not
for
that
reason
and
the
malebashers
he

are
repugnant
hatemongers
no
better

they

no
ones
right
as

white

yes
but
everyone
else
needs
to

and
realize
that

right
back
is
disgusting
racist
and

why
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyone
fairly
without
generalizing
what
stupidity
gene
makes
this
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
missing
in
this
whole
discourse
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
words
it
is
the
l
word
loser
thats
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
this
argument
it
is
all
about
winning
and
losing
and
nothing
else
let
me
explain
remember
the
eighties
no
excuses
nobody
who
can
handle
a
mail
buffer
can
claim
they
are
too
young
to
remember
ronald
reagan
yet
the
eighties
were
about
how
america
learned
to
win
once
again
then
wouldnt
you
know
we
won
so
well
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
win
no
cold
war
to
endure
no
nuclear
holocaust
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
we
forgot
about
outer
space
long
ago
the
kind
of
overwhelming
no
holds
barred
success
that
killed
alexander
the
great
yes
there
were
a
few
little
problems
along
the
way
stock
market
meltdown
here
an
sl
bailout
there
a
few
revolts
and
crazy
middle
eastern
dictators
to
contend
with
but
as
tacitus
would
tell
ya
the
god
augustus
never
had
it
so
good
in
the
meantime
there
is
guilt
for
winning
maybe
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserve
ones
bounty
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
days
bill
clinton
affirmative
action
and
lots
of
discourse
about
people
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
us
in
the
winning
business
this
kind
of
talk
is
mildly
irritating
but
there
is
still
no
suggestion
of
losing
but
what
do
we
find
now
to
put
it
mildy
the
stereotype
of
our
white
male
nonwinner
is
woody
hayes
in
the
rose
bowl
punching
out
photojournalists
when
those
california
fruits
and
nuts
steal
another
one
with
a
hail
mary
pass
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
whole
idea
behind
three
yards
and
a
cloud
of
dust
is
to
wear
your
opponent
down
until
he
collapses
in
the
final
period
but
woody
just
used
his
fists
uzzies
seem
to
be
the
weapon
of
choice
these
days
who
is
dfens
anyway
the
answer
is
as
plain
as
the
horn
rims
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
douglas
posing
as
a
loser
this
is
known
as
controversial
casting
but
that
baggy
shortsleeved
white
shirt
sure
does
look
natural
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woody
always
dressed
that
way
did
we
really
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrobe
without
putting
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
starting
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bashing
dfens
is
the
same
game
as
bashing
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
used
to
blow
away
all
the
time
as
that
archwasp
male
gender
george
c
scott
declaimed
americans
traditionally
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
tolerate
a
loser
and
so
on
the
political
implications
are
simple
if
as
many
socialists
and
democrats
do
you
consider
society
a
finite
pie
to
a
apportioned
in
some
equitable
way
then
you
have
to
worry
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
women
today
asian
homosexuals
tommorrow
and
yes
indeed
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determined
day
when
the
balance
of
the
pie
has
finally
swung
against
that
minority
or
you
can
just
blow
the
whole
thing
off
and
say
as
do
most
conservatives
and
all
the
libertarians
and
act
is
if
you
didnt
care
whos
winning
and
whos
losing
in
some
cases
you
might
say
something
about
make
sure
the
game
is
fair
equality
of
opportunity
not
of
condition
in
the
latter
case
you
might
be
able
to
identify
yourself
as
a
neoconservative
or
a
neoliberal
depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
limit
the
pot
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduate
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunions
but
it
beats
being
a
nerd
as
i
would
imagine
michael
douglas
would
now
agree
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
only
way
to
go
even
in
hollywood
which
treats
losers
worse
than
any
other
place
in
america
except
for
new
york
and
washington
dc
and
even
in
columbus
ohio
which
produced
alex
keaton
but
no
champion
football
teams
in

id
like
to
see
more
winners
in
this
society
regardless
of
race
gender
religious
preference
and
sexual
orientation
maybe
we
should
even
let
a

more
of

be

once
pointed
out
that
curious
fact
well
since
tax
evasion
is
illegal
one
generally
would
not
bother
to
consider
whether
it
was
unpatriotic
or
not
how
often
does
one
think
of
murder
as
being
unpatriotic
perhaps
a
more
appropriate
question
would
be
why
is
tax
avoidance
not
considered
unpatriotic
the
answer
to
this
is
simple
tax
avoidance
is
simply
defined
as
paying
the
minimum
tax
you
are
legally
obligated
to
pay
there
is
a
deeper
reason
taxes
by
their
very
nature
are
unamerican
one
need
only
look
at
the
birth
and
history
of
the
us
to
see
this
fact
wasnt
the
beef
with
the
english
over
taxation
without
representation
not
taxation
itself
from
my
admittedly
dim
recollection
of
us
history
most
of
the
problems
we
americans
have

have

you

when
the
pdfa
on
one
hand
says
that
all
drugs
are
absolutely
bad
bad
badand
this
newsgroup
consistently
refuses
to
admit
that
drugs
like
heroin
even
have
negative
side
effects
heroin
is
a
relatively
safe
drug
what
makes
it
unsafe
are
iv
administration
and
shit
like
adulterants
there
are
side
effects
like
withdrawal
but
they
effect
people
differently
ive
seen
numerous
posts
claiming
heroin
has
lower
addiction
rates
that
cigarettes
which
might
be
true
but
it
is
very
deceiving
because
heroin
is
much
more
harmful
drug
to
be
addicted
to
than
cigarettes
heroin
addicts
are
far
more
prone
to
end
up
in

gutter
and
destroy
their
family
and
friends
than
people
addicted
to
just
cigarettes
stereotypical
statement
i
know
people
who
use
heroin
and
opiates
that
function
just
fine
in
society
this
group
does
provide
some
very
good
information
to
people
but
i
am
worried
that
the
prolegalizationprodecriminalization
movement
is
being
hurt
when
it
refuses
to
admit
that
anysome
drugs
are
very
harmful
name
some
of
these
drugs
so
we
can
debate
about
them
more
specifically
im
all
for
legalization
of
most
drugs
but
when
someone
asks
me
about
relative
risks
of
certain
drugs
or
possible
bad
side
effects
i
would
like
to
know
themand
not
be
given
the
runaround
by
this
groupwhich
recently
tried
to
tell
me
that
pot
was
not
harmful
in
any
manner
to
peoples
lungs
no
no
no
or
at
least
i
havent
been
arguing
this
there
is
not
enough
data
to
form
a
scientific
conclusion
that
doesnt
mean
that
cannabis
is
benign
to
users
lungs
we
can
form
all
the
theories
we
want
but
they
are
only
theories
some
theories
are
supported
by
more
evidence
than
others
and
that
makes
them
stronger
i
think
its
time
yall
reexamined
your
positions
and
try
to
understand
that
you
cannot
fight
the
pdfa
by
calling
them
a

my
audio
letterr
no
its
now
been
almost
one
month
since
war
broke
out
in
the
south
atlantic
on
the
surface
it
seems
that
its
only
a
dispute
between
argentina
and
great
britain
over
the
barren
windswept
falkland
islands
and
south
georgia
island
in
reality
its
far
more
than
that
the
socalled
falklands
crisis
is
just
the
visible
tip
of
a
giant
military
operation
during
this
month
of
april
fierce
naval
battles
have
taken
placenot
only
in
the
south
atlantic
but
also
in
the
south
pacific
up
to
now
most
of
the
hostilities
have
been
kept
under
wraps
by
wartime
censorship
on
all
sides
but
as
i
say
these
words
the
naval
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
is
about
to
come
to
the
surface
beginning
today
april
a
total
naval
and
air
blockade
of
the
falklands
by
the
royal
navy
has
begun
at
the
same
time
a
counterblockade
has
been
declared
by
argentina
in
the
same
area
to
be
effective
a
blockade
must
be
imposed
over
a
period
of
time
but
the
royal
navy
does
not
have
that
much
time
winter
is
coming
on
in
the
south
atlantic
and
the
british
supply
lines
are
overextended
having
come
this
far
her
majestys
navy
cannot
simply
drop
the
blockade
and
sail
away
in
a
few
weeks
time
without
drawing
blood
from
argentina
as
a
result
the
british
will
be
forced
to
undertake
military
operations
very
soon
no
matter
how
risky
they
may
be
there
is
also
another
reason
why
the
royal
navy
now
has
no
choice
but
to
engage
the
argentine
forces
in
combat
that
reason
my
friends
is
that
the
royal
navy
has
already
suffered
losses
in
secret
combat
this
month
up
to
this
moment
there
will
be
no
way
to
explain
away
the
damage
which
has
been
sustained
by
the
british
fleet
only
when
publicly
admitted
fighting
erupts
will
the
british
dare
to
admit
that
they
have
suffered
battle
losses
to
obtain
that
cover
story
the
british
have
no
choice
but
to
sail
into
combat
but
in
doing
so
they
will
be
risking
even
heavier
losses
on
top
of
those
already
sustained
in
short
my
friends
her
majestys
navy
has
sailed
into
a
trap
the
events
now
unfolding
in
the
south
atlantic
carry
strange
ironic
echoes
of
the
past
for
weeks
now
weve
been
hearing
countless
commentators
referring
to
the
british
task
force
as
an
armada
quote
the
british
of
all
people
ought
to
be
very
uneasy
with
that
description
the
original
spanish
armada
years
ago
was
renowned
as
a
seemingly
invincible
fighting
force
but
it
came
to
grief
in
a
naval
disaster
so
complete
that
it
changed
the
course
of
historyand
it
was
none
other
than
the
english
navy
that
destroyed
the
spanish
armada
the
original
spanish
armada
put
to
sea
in
during
the
reign
of
englands
queen
elizabeth
i
the
armada
was
an
invasion
fleet
carrying
thousands
of
crack
fighting
men
to
invade
england
they
were
met
by
the
daring
sea
dogs
of
sir
francis
drake
drake
and
his
small
fast
ships
turned
the
tables
on
the
spanish
armada
by
changing
the
rules
of
battle
the
english
fleet
was
equipped
with
new
longerrange
guns
and
it
stayed
upwind
and
out
of
reach
from
there
the
english
pounded
smashed
and
shattered
the
big
ships
of
the
mighty
armada
when
it
was
all
over
barely
half
the
spanish
fleet
was
left
to
limp
back
to
port
drakes
defeat
of
the
spanish
armada
was
a
shock
to
the
world
it
opened
the
door
for
england

the
falkland
islands
crisis
began
early
this
month
it
looked
at
first
like
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
for
a
century
and
a
half
since
the
islands
have
been
controlled
by
great
britain
during
that
entire
time
british
sovereignty
over
the
falklands
has
been
disputed
by
argentina
there
have
been
countless
threats
by
argentina
to
seize
the
islands
which
it
calls
the
malvinas
but
the
threats
have
always
come
to
nothing
in
the
past
and
britain
has
never
even
gotten
very
worried
about
them
the
islands
are
four
times
as
distant
from
argentina
as
cuba
is
from
the
united
states
and
they
are
not
much
of
a
prize
after
years
of
occupancy
the
falklands
are
home
to
fewer
than
british
settlers
and
a
lot
of
sheep
in
short
the
remote
falkland
islands
hardly
look
like
something
to
fight
over
and
yet
here
we
are
watching
another
crisis
take
place
we
are
watching
as
war
erupts
between
great
britain
and
argentina
the
thatcher
government
is
acting
as
if
it
has
forgotten
all
about
its
usual
preoccupation
with
the
soviet
threat
at
natos
doorstep
instead
britain
is
throwing
almost
everything
its
got
at
argentinaaircraft
carriers
cruisers
destroyers
submarines
assault
shipsyou
name
it
luxury
cruise
ships
have
even
been
commissioned
and
turned
into
troop
carriers
overnight
wave
after
wave
of
additional
assault
troops
have
been
activated
and
sent
to
join
the
fleet
even
after
it
sailed
ships
and
submarines
have
been
pulled
off
station
from
normal
nato
duty
and
sent
to
reinforce
the
task
force
the
initial
force
has
grown
steadily
over
the
past
several
weeks
into
an
armada
numbering
over
over
twothirds
of
the
entire
royal
navy
has
already
been
deployed
to
the
south
atlantic
off
argentina
watching
all
this
a
lot
of
people
are
asking
whats
this
fight
really
all
about
the
most
popular
answer
suggested
in
the
major
media
is
oil
vast
deposits
of
oil
are
known
to
exist
under
the
continental
shelf
between
argentina
and
the
falklands
but
that
has
been
known
for
nearly
years
in
no
way
does
it
explain
the
timing
of
the
sudden
military
offensive
by
argentina
this
month
and
oil
explains
even
less
about
the
argentine
seizure
of
south
georgia
island
south
georgia
island
is
miles
east
of
the
falklands
with
no
known
oil
deposits
anywhere
near
it
and
compared
to
south
georgia
the
falklands
are
an
island
paradise
south
georgia
island
is
covered
with
rugged
mountains
treacherous
valleys
glaciers
and
semipermanent
snow
most
of
it
is
uninhabitable
on
top
of
all
that
argentina
has
absolutely
no
legal
or
historical
claim
to
south
georgia
island
in
that
respect
it
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
falklands
in
the
early
the
falklands
were
occupied
for
a
while
by
argentine
colonists
in
the
british
expelled
them
and
took
over
the
island
for
that
and
other
historical
reasons
argentina
argues
that
the
falklands
really
belong
to
argentina
not
britain
but
no
such
argument
is
possible
for
south
georgia
island
it
has
always
been
controlled
by
britain
never
by
argentina
or
spain
the
argentine
seizure
of
south
georgia
island
looks
even
more
unreasonable
from
a
military
point
of
view
argentinas
leaders
are
military
men
and
they
think
in
military
terms
they
were
well
aware
ahead
of
time
that
faroff
south
georgia
island
could
not
possibly
be
held
for
long
by
seizing
it
they
were
setting
themselves
up
to
absorb
a
military
defeat
as
the
island
was
retaken
by
britain
so
the
question
is
why
did
argentinas
military
junta
bother
with
the
seemingly
worthless
south
georgia
island
at
all
my
friends
the
answers
to
all
these
questions
are
military
not
political
or
economic
south
georgia
island
possesses
an
enormous
military
secret
its
a
giant
underground
installation
buried
under
the
mountains
at
the
northwest
end
of
the
island
the
real
reason
for
the
socalled
falkland
crisis
is
this
secret
installation
together
with
two
other
similar
installations
which
i
will
describe
shortly
the
secret
military
complexes
have
been
in
existence
for
many
years
they
are
not
new
what
is
new
is
the
accelerated
nuclear
war
timetable
of
the
american
bolshevik
war
planners
here
in
washington
for
the
past
two
months
ive
been
reporting
the
details
of
this
new
war
plan
to
you
as
quickly
as
i
can
obtain
and
verify
them
the
plan
calls
for
nuclear
war
one
to
erupt
by
september
of
this
year
it
is
this
fastapproaching
nuclear
war
threat
that
caused
the
socalled
falklands
crisis
to
erupt
now
what
is
going
on
now
is
a
coordinated
effort
to
spoil
part
of
the
bolshevik
grand
strategy
for
the
coming
nuclear
war
the
mutual
enemies
of
the
american
bolsheviks
herenamely
the
rockefeller
carteland
russias
new
rulers
in
the
kremlin
are
behind
the
present
crisis
they
are
trying
to
ruin
phase
of
the
project
z
war
plan
which
i
revealed
last
month
that
phase
is
to
be
world
domination
by
the
american
bolsheviks
after
both
russia
and
the
united
states
have
been
destroyed
in
nuclear
war
one
as
i
mentioned
last
month
the
key
to
this
plan
is
the
existence
of
secret
weapons
stockpiles
in
various
places
around
the
world
the
american
bolshevik
military
planners
here
in
america
are
working
with
other
bolshevik
agents
in
key
military
positions
of
other
countries
to
set
off
war
having
done
that
they
intend
to
ride
out
the
nuclear
holocaust
they
have
caused
safe
and
cozy
in
government
war
bunkers
when
the
warring
nations
finally
lie
smoldering
and
exhausted
the
bolsheviks
will
leave
the
shattered
remains
of
their
host
countries
they
will
rendezvous
at
the
secret
weapons
installations
and
bring
their
weapons
into
the
open
they
will
confront
the
world
with
the
only
remaining
fresh
uptodate
powerful
military
force
on
earth
and
using
that
military
power
they
will
become
the
undisputed
rulers
of
the
worldthat
is
they
plan
to
do
all
this
and
they
plan
to
pave
the
way
for
world
domination
very
soon
by
setting
off
nuclear
war
one
in
a
matter
of
months
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
russias
new
antibolshevik
rulers
are
working
together
in
a
race
against
time
to
try
to
head
off
the
bolshevik
war
plan
last
month
i
mentioned
that
the
bolsheviks
here
are
benefitting
from
war
preparations
which
were
started
by
the
rockefellers
long
ago
it
has
only
been
about
three
years
since
the
rockefellers
were
dislodged
as
the
prime
movers
of
the
united
states
government
by
the
bolsheviks
since
that
time
the
united
states
government
has
been
a
house
divided
torn
by
internal
power
struggles
between
rival
bolshevik
and
rockefeller
factions
but
before
that
the
united
states
had
been
dominated
for
decades
both
economically
and
politically
by
the
four
rockefeller
brothers
in
the
brothers
launched
a
new
longrange
plan
for
world
domination
it
was
a
twoprong
strategy
half
visible
and
half
secret
which
i
first
described
long
ago
in
audio
letter
no
it
was
a
plan
for
the
united
states
to
arm
to
the
teeth
in
secret
while
appearing
to
disarm
gradually
without
repeating
all
the
details
the
basic
idea
was
grandiose
yet
simple
by
deliberately
appearing
weak
the
rockefellercontrolled
united
states
would
maneuver
itself
into
a
nuclear
war
with
russia
then
the
secret
weapons
including
superweapons
would
be
unleashed
to
smash
russia
and
take
over
the
world
when
they
set
the
grand
plan
in
motion
in
the
rockefeller
brothers
were
looking
ahead
to
a
nuclear
war
by
the
late
their
military
analysts
concluded
very
early
that
the
war
being
planned
would
have
very
different
effects
on
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
both
superpowers
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
are
located
well
up
in
the
northern
hemisphere
so
are
the
other
fullfledged
nuclear
powersgreat
britain
france
red
china
and
india
by
contrast
the
strategic
targets
for
nuclear
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
are
relatively
few
and
far
between
in
other
words
it
was
expected
that
the
coming
nuclear
war
would
be
essentially
a
northern
hemisphere
war
in
an
allout
nuclear
holocaust
it
is
known
that
serious
radioactive
fallout
will
gradually
spread
to
affect
even
areas
not
initially
hit
by
war
but
there
are
limits
to
how
far
the
war
clouds
can
spread
it
was
discovered
long
ago
that
there
is
very
little
mixing
between
the
air
of
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
in
the
northern
half
of
our
planet
cold
air
from
the
north
pole
works
its
way
southward
towards
the
equator
then
it
works
its
way
back
to
the
north
as
warm
air
a
mirror
image
of
this
process
takes
up
the
southern
half
of
the
planet
northern
and
southern
hemisphere
air
meet
in
the
equatorial
zone
but
very
little
of
the
air
changes
places
the
military
conclusion
my
friends
is
this
the
coming
nuclear
war
could
ruin
large
areas
of
the
northern
hemisphere
for
generations
to
come
but
if
the
calculations
are
right
the
southern
hemisphere
could
escape
virtually
unaffected
by
the
war
this
was
music
to
the
ears
of
the
four
rockefeller
brothers
a
quick
look
at
the
globe
of
the
world
shows
why
the
rockefeller
cartel
has
dominated
latin
america
ever
since
world
war
ii
as
i
discussed
in
my
very
first
monthly
audio
letter
nelson
rockefeller
solidified
the
cartel
grip
on
latin
america
during
the
war
he
accomplished
this
as
socalled
coordinator
of
hemispheric
defense
for
thenpresident
franklin
d
roosevelt
so
that
takes
care
of
the
south
american
continent
and
its
natural
resources
then
there
is
the
african
continent
there
too
rockefeller
control
was
already
in
effect
over
wide
areas
of
black
africa
especially
south
of
the
equator
all
this
was
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
john
d
rockefeller
iii
as
i
detailed
in
audio
letter
no
looking
around
the
globe
the
most
important
remaining
land
masses
from
the
standpoint
of
world
domination
are
australia
and
new
zealand
thanks
to
world
war
ii
both
were
wide
open
to
the
rockefellers
the
rockefeller
brothers
decided
to
establish
secret
military
installations
in
the
southern
hemisphere
for
use
after
the
coming
war
by
this
means
they
expected
to
become
the
masters
of
the
surviving
southern
half
of
planet
earth
after
the
northern
hemisphere
war
then
as
the
northern
hemisphere
gradually
recovered
from
the
nuclear
holocaust
the
rockefeller
empire
would
be
able
to
pick
up
the
pieces
in
this
way
the
third
generation
rockefeller
brothers
expected
their
family
dynasty
to
inherit
the
earth
in
order
to
control
the
southern
hemisphere
militarily
after
the
war
some
means
would
have
to
be
available
to
project
military
power
onto
any
land
mass
for
example
revolts
against
rockefeller
domination
would
require
troopsnot
a
blast
from
the
beam
weapons
on
the
moon
the
most
critical
factor
for
postwar
military
domination
of
the
world
was
found
to
be
a
navy
a
minimum
of
two
secret
naval
fleets
would
be
requiredone
based
in
the
south
atlantic
the
other
in
the
south
pacific
since
the
reserve
naval
fleets
were
to
be
kept
secret
until
after
the
northern
hemisphere
nuclear
war
they
could
not
be
built
in
existing
shipyards
new
construction
facilities
had
to
be
built
and
they
had
to
be
hidden
to
hide
an
entire
shipyard
is
no
small
task
they
take
up
a
lot
of
space
on
top
of
that
it
was
essential
that
the
ships
remain
hidden
after
they
were
built
the
best
way
to
achieve
that
was
to
combine
the
shipyard
and
naval
base
into
one
overall
secret
installation
finally
the
secret
naval
installation
had
to
be
invulnerable
to
nuclear
attack
otherwise
if
its
existence
were
ever
discovered
prematurely
the
secret
navy
might
be
wiped
out
the
combined
requirements
for
secrecy
space
and
protection
against
attack
were
formidable
but
one
day
in
while
all
these
plans
were
still
in
the
early
stages
of
development
the
answer
presented
itself
during
a
socalled
banking
trip
to
sweden
david
rockefeller
was
given
a
tour
of
a
unique
hidden
naval
port
the
port
is
hollowed
out
from
solid
granite
cliffs
which
come
right
down
to
the
water
the
entrance
to
the
port
is
a
gigantic
hole
in
the
side
of
the
cliff
which
can
be
sealed
off
with
enormous
steel
doors
inside
this
big
doorway
on
the
water
a
huge
cavity
has
been
hollowed
out
to
accommodate
ships
the
rockefeller
brothers
and
their
military
adviser
decided
that
a
bigger
more
secret
better
protected
version
of
the
swedish
hidden
port
was
just
what
they
wanted
a
survey
of
candidate
sites
was
then
initiated
the
site
survey
covered
coastal
areas
throughout
the
southern
hemisphere
many
areas
were
rejected
very
quickly
because
the
topography
was
wrong
other
areas
were
rejected
because
they
were
too
close
to
the
equator
still
others
had
to
be
ruled
out
because
there
were
too
many
people
living
nearby
making
the
desired
level
of
secrecy
impossible
finally
it
was
essential
that
the
sites
chosen
for
the
secret
naval
installations
be
totally
secure
politically
at
last
the
sites
for
the
secret
naval
installations
were
selected
in
the
south
pacific
extreme
southern
new
zealand
was
selected
this
is
what
i
was
alluding
to
in
audio
letter
no
three
months
ago
when
i
called
attention
to
new
zealands
extreme
importance
in
the
coming
war
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
space
the
secret
new
zealand
naval
installation
had
to
be
divided
up
into
two
sites
located
close
together
one
is
at
the
extreme
southwest
tip
of
south
island
where
the
mountain
range
known
as
the
southern
alps
comes
down
virtually
to
the
waters
edge
the
other
part
of
the
installation
is
built
into
the
northwest
tip
of
stewart
island
which
is
off
the
tip
of
south
island
the
stewart
island
facility
is
hollowed
out
within
a
rise
known
as
mt
anglem
the
new
zealand
location
met
all
the
requirements
ever
since
world
war
ii
the
government
of
new
zealand
has
been
tied
even
closer
to
the
united
states
than
to
great
britain
the
location
is
far
from
the
equator
and
the
installations
are
buried
deep
under
mountains
protected
from
nuclear
attack
they
are
also
too
deep
to
be
reached
by
particlebeam
attacks
and
the
new
zealand
site
is
well
situated
to
command
the
entire
south
pacific
in
the
south
atlantic
an
even
more
perfect
site
was
found
that
site
my
friends
is
south
georgia
island
it
is
located
perfectly
for
naval
domination
of
the
entire
south
atlantic
the
tall
rugged
mountains
provided
a
perfect
location
for
the
secret
installation
at
the
northwest
tip
of
the
long
island
it
is
controlled
by
great
britain
whose
government
like
that
of
new
zealand
was
willing
to
cooperate
and
south
georgia
island
was
virtually
uninhabited
except
for
a
whaling
station
on
the
northeast
coast
the
whaling
station
was
some
miles
away
from
the
secret
new
installation
which
was
being
built
but
britain
took
no
chances
in
the
whaling
station
was
closed
down
since
that
time
there
have
been
no
inhabitants
on
south
georgia
island
except
for
a
few
dozen
alleged
antarctic
scientists
construction
of
the
secret
naval
facilitiestwo
in
new
zealand
one
on
south
georgia
islandbegan
in
the
early
the
techniques
were
adapted
from
those
used
previously
to
build
other
large
underground
facilities
such
as
the
norad
installation
inside
cheyenne
mountain
colorado
however
these
techniques
were
adapted
in
radically
new
ways
to
achieve
construction
access
directly
from
the
sea
instead
of
overland
in
this
way
the
sheltering
mountain
was
left
undisturbed
in
appearance
both
during
and
after
construction
the
cuts
in
the
mountain
side
which
were
necessary
to
let
ships
in
and
out
were
kept
as
small
as
possible
and
were
well
camouflaged
like
the
swedish
hidden
naval
port
arrangement
the
entrances
to
the
secret
installations
can
be
sealed
up
when
sealed
the
entrance
is
virtually
impossible
to
detect
unless
you
know
exactly
where
it
is
and
unlike
most
large
construction
projects
there
are
no
tailings
or
piles
of
leftover
rock
lying
around
to
attract
attention
the
manmade
caverns
which
house
the
secret
naval
installations
are
enormous
but
all
the
rock
and
debris
was
disposed
of
at
sea
once
the
secret
naval
facilities
were
built
they
had
to
be
outfitted
for
ship
construction
and
docksite
storage
the
fake
disarmament
of
the
united
states
during
the
contributed
greatly
to
this
task
from
to
one
man
played
a
pivotal
role
in
this
elaborate
rockefeller
scheme
he
was
thensecretary
of
defense
robert
mcnamara
all
through
the
mcnamara
presided
over
the
public
paring
back
of
americas
visible
military
power
this
included
the
closing
down
and
dismantling
of
entire
shipyards
what
we
were
not
told
was
where
all
that
shipyard
equipment
went
afterwards
where
it
went
my
friends
was
to
the
new
secret
installations
which
were
being
outfitted
in
new
zealand
and
south
georgia
island
the
secret
naval
installations
have
been
used
as
duplication
facilities
to
reproduce
certain
ships
and
submarines
designed
and
built
here
in
the
united
states
as
defense
secretary
caspar
weinberger
told
congress
recently
it
is
cheaper
to
build
two
ships
at
a
time
that
is
especially
true
if
the
second
ship
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
first
this
has
become
even
more
true
in
recent
years
through
the
use
of
computerized
manufacturing
techniques
the
secret
naval
fleets
which
have
been
built
at
the
secret
installations
are
made
up
of
duplicatesexact
duplicates
of
certain
other
ships
and
submarines
they
are
all
nuclear
powerednuclear
subs
nuclear
cruisers
nuclear
destroyers
and
yes
nuclear
aircraft
carriers
three
of
them
a
secret
twin
was
built
for
the
uss
nimitz
for
the
uss
eisenhower
and
for
the
newlylaunched
uss
carl
vincent
all
have
been
financed
through
the
gigantic
cost
overruns
so
called
that
we
constantly
hear
about
in
the
defense
department
and
all
three
carriers
have
been
provided
with
a
full
complement
of
aircraft
whose
manufacture
was
financed
the
same
way
the
ships
of
the
secret
american
bolshevik
naval
fleets
are
all
duplicates
of
other
nuclearpowered
vessels
even
so
the
secret
naval
ships
possess
one
key
difference
last
month
i
revealed
that
the
socalled
stealth
program
has
succeeded
in
developing
a
kind
of
electromagnetic
invisibility
shield
this
technique
makes
an
object
invisible
from
a
distance
by
distorting
light
waves
in
its
vicinity
a
whole
new
fleet
of
phantom
warplanes
are
now
going
into
crash
production
that
use
this
principle
and
my
friends
all
of
the
secret
american
bolshevik
navy
ships
have
already
been
outfitted
with
similar
stealthfield
equipment
the
stealth
principle
is
actually
easier
to
apply
to
ships
than
to
airplanes
because
there
is
more
room
for
the
powerful
equipment
that
generates
the
field
after
nuclear
war
one
the
secret
stealth
navy
of
the
american
bolsheviks
would
be
light
years
ahead
of
any
other
navy
left
on
earth
it
would
be
perfect
for
the
intended
role
of
world
domination
the
rockefellers
set
it
all
in
motion
long
ago
my
friends
but
three
years
ago
they
lost
control
of
the
united
states
military
now
its
the
american
bolsheviks
who
are
in
control
and
they
are
bent
on
war
these
secret
naval
installations
have
precipitated
what
is
being
called
the
falklands
crisis
topic
audio
letterr
no
last
month
i
described
project
z
the
new
bolshevik
threephase
strategy
for
nuclear
war
one
an
elite
group
of
american
bolshevik
military
planners
here
are
flushing
out
the
plan
right
now
at
a
secret
warroom
here
in
washington
its
a
plan
by
which
the
united
states
will
strike
the
first
nuclear
blow
followed
by
allout
thermonuclear
war
with
russia
having
set
off
the
holocaust
the
bolsheviks
here
and
in
certain
other
countries
plan
to
rise
it
out
safe
in
comfortable
war
bunkers
finally
after
nuclear
war
one
fizzles
out
in
stalemate
they
plan
to
leave
behind
the
ashes
of
the
united
states
and
her
allies
activating
phase
of
their
grand
strategy
they
plan
to
unveil
their
secret
weapons
especially
their
secret
naval
fleets
with
these
they
plan
to
conquer
and
rule
what
is
left
of
the
world
the
united
states
as
we
know
it
will
be
dead
and
gone
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
bolsheviks
themselves
this
outcome
will
constitute
victory
up
to
now
the
nuclear
war
timetable
which
i
first
revealed
two
months
ago
is
still
on
track
they
are
still
shooting
for
nuclear
war
to
begin
by
september
of
this
year
time
is
fast
running
out
the
bolsheviks
here
are
sprinting
as
fast
as
they
can
toward
war
but
my
friends
the
bolsheviks
are
not
the
only
runners
in
this
race
they
have
two
deadly
enemies
both
of
whom
are
equally
determined
to
trip
up
the
bolsheviks
one
enemy
of
the
bolsheviks
here
is
the
rockefeller
cartel
the
other
enemy
is
the
new
antibolshevik
ruling
clique
in
russia
and
now
these
two
mutual
enemies
of
the
bolsheviks
are
pooling
their
efforts
in
certain
ways
in
audio
letter
no
three
months
ago
i
reported
that
a
limited
new
antibolshevik
coalition
was
in
the
works
between
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
the
january
meeting
between
haig
and
gromyko
in
geneva
switzerland
was
a
turning
point
in
the
formation
of
this
coalition
it
is
now
a
reality
and
is
responsible
for
the
socalled
falkland
crisis
now
dominating
the
headlines
it
should
be
emphasized
that
this
new
relationship
between
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
russia
falls
far
short
of
a
true
alliance
they
have
very
major
disputes
to
be
settled
between
them
but
for
the
time
being
they
have
called
a
truce
between
themselves
to
deal
with
their
mutual
deadly
enemythe
bolsheviks
here
in
america
the
first
priority
of
the
russians
and
the
rockefellers
is
to
slow
down
the
bolshevik
preparations
for
imminent
nuclear
war
if
they
can
do
that
time
is
on
the
side
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
in
certain
political
movements
which
i
discussed
last
summer
in
audio
letter
no
a
slowdown
in
the
nuclear
war
timetable
will
also
give
more
breathing
space
for
additional
antibolshevik
actions
to
be
implemented
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
planners
decided
by
midfebruary
that
military
action
against
the
bolsheviks
was
essential
very
quickly
no
other
type
of
action
had
any
hope
of
taking
effect
fast
enough
to
prevent
nuclear
war
by
the
end
of
this
summer
the
exact
details
of
the
project
z
war
plan
are
not
known
to
either
the
rockefellers
or
the
russians
but
the
general
outlines
are
known
to
be
as
i
described
last
month
it
was
decided
that
military
action
should
be
devised
that
would
undermine
phase
of
the
bolshevik
war
planthat
is
the
bolshevikcontrolled
secret
naval
installations
and
fleets
in
the
southern
hemisphere
should
be
attacked
and
crippled
by
working
together
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
were
able
to
devise
an
attack
plan
which
neither
could
have
carried
out
alone
the
rockefeller
group
who
built
and
originally
controlled
these
bases
provided
detailed
intelligence
about
the
best
way
to
attack
them
the
russians
with
their
enormous
military
machine
provided
the
muscle
to
actually
carry
out
the
attack
it
was
essential
to
devise
a
scheme
that
would
enable
both
secret
fleets
in
the
south
atlantic
and
south
pacific
to
be
attacked
survival
intact
of
either
fleet
would
leave
the
bolshevik
war
plan
still
workable
military
analysts
concluded
very
quickly
that
a
direct
assault
on
the
new
zealand
facilities
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
no
combination
of
commandos
frogmen
or
other
military
force
which
could
possibly
keep
an
attack
secret
from
the
outside
world
any
attack
on
the
new
zealand
bases
would
set
off
the
very
war
which
the
rockefellers
and
russians
want
to
prevent
but
the
situation
in
the
south
atlantic
was
a
different
matter
in
a
way
the
greatest
asset
of
south
georgia
island
was
also
its
achilles
heel
the
extreme
isolation
which
protected
the
secrecy
of
the
south
georgia
base
also
made
a
covert
military
assault
feasible
the
key
lay
with
argentina
and
her
longstanding
claims
to
the
falkland
islands
as
i
mentioned
in
topic
the
rockefeller
cartel
has
dominated
all
of
latin
america
for
decades
cartel
operatives
were
sent
to
argentina
to
work
out
a
deal
with
the
government
military
junta
there
the
historic
dispute
over
the
falkland
islands
was
to
be
used
to
provide
a
ruse
a
military
cover
to
enable
the
south
georgia
base
to
be
attacked
the
argentine
generals
were
not
told
everything
about
the
situation
by
any
means
but
they
were
told
enough
to
make
clear
what
they
were
to
do
as
an
inducement
to
cooperate
the
argentine
leaders
were
promised
handsome
rewards
they
were
guaranteed
that
after
the
shooting
was
over
the
falkland
islands
would
remain
in
argentine
hands
this
guarantee
included
the
promise
of
covert
military
assistance
as
needed
against
the
royal
navy
and
to
bolster
the
troubled
argentine
economy
it
was
promised
that
the
rockefeller
cartel
will
help
develop
the
immense
offshore
oil
reserves
with
these
combined
promises
of
military
glory
and
financial
rewards
the
argentine
military
junta
agreed
to
the
plan
on
march
argentina
carried
out
act
in
the
joint
attack
plan
a
group
of
argentine
scrapmetal
merchants
of
all
things
landed
at
the
abandoned
old
whaling
station
on
south
georgia
island
supposedly
they
were
there
to
dismantle
the
old
buildings
and
cart
them
off
to
sell
while
they
were
at
it
they
also
raised
the
argentine
flag
over
the
worksite
the
british
always
nervous
about
south
georgia
island
promptly
reacted
as
expected
the
british
antarctic
survey
ship
endurance
put
marines
ashore
they
drove
off
the
scrap
merchants
and
tore
down
the
argentine
flag
the
incident
provided
the
desired
excuse
for
the
argentine
junta
to
bring
the
simmering
falklands
dispute
to
a
boil
from
time
to
time
in
the
past
argentina
has
claimed
that
south
georgia
is
part
of
the
falklands
because
it
is
administered
that
way
by
britain
that
argument
is
very
flimsy
but
it
now
came
in
very
handy
it
was
nothing
new
to
hear
this
from
argentine
leaders
so
there
was
no
hint
of
what
was
really
afoot
during
late
march
argentine
military
forces
started
assembling
for
an
assault
on
the
falklands
nothing
new
thought
the
british
high
command
argentina
has
carried
out
threatening
maneuvers
in
the
past
many
times
it
was
believed
that
they
were
about
to
do
it
again
but
on
april
argentine
forces
did
the
unexpected
after
many
past
false
alarms
this
time
they
actually
invaded
and
seized
the
islands
all
argentine
public
statements
emphasized
the
longstanding
historical
claims
to
the
falklands
themselves
but
just
for
good
measure
the
next
day
a
small
argentine
force
also
seized
faroff
south
georgia
island
the
force
was
so
small
that
it
gave
the
appearance
initially
that
it
was
just
a
side
show
from
argentinas
point
of
view
however
the
small
contingent
of
royal
marines
were
overpowered
and
bundled
off
the
island
along
with
a
group
of
alleged
scientists
that
was
the
moment
of
payoff
in
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
attack
plan
thanks
to
the
elaborate
distraction
staged
by
the
argentine
forces
a
special
commando
team
got
onto
the
island
undetected
based
on
the
detailed
rockefeller
information
about
the
base
the
team
moved
to
a
location
on
the
mountain
directly
above
the
cavernous
secret
base
special
highspeed
drilling
equipment
was
set
up
by
the
rockefeller
members
of
the
team
while
the
russian
members
concentrated
on
military
defense
by
late
that
evening
april
the
military
high
command
in
london
finally
learned
what
was
really
taking
place
the
secret
south
georgia
base
was
under
attack
by
virtually
the
only
means
possible
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
team
were
drilling
a
shaft
down
through
the
mountain
toward
the
hollowed
out
cavern
inside
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
their
drill
would
break
through
the
ceiling
of
the
giant
hidden
naval
base
once
the
hole
was
made
the
next
step
was
obvious
the
rockefellerrussian
team
would
put
a
weapon
of
some
kind
through
the
hole
the
best
guess
was
that
it
would
be
a
nerve
gas
the
shock
waves
that
went
through
the
highest
levels
of
the
british
government
on
the
evening
of
april
can
hardly
be
described
my
friends
the
thatcher
government
like
the
socalled
reagan
administration
here
in
america
is
bolshevik
controlled
thats
why
margaret
thatcher
always
says
me
too
any
time
the
reagan
administration
says
or
does
anything
against
russia
both
governments
are
party
to
the
secret
nuclear
war
plan
in
complete
betrayal
of
the
people
of
their
respective
countries
and
on
the
evening
of
april
they
suddenly
discovered
that
their
precious
war
plan
was
in
deep
deep
trouble
immediately
the
thatcher
government
started
assembling
a
naval
armada
to
sail
for
the
south
atlantic
haste
was
the
order
of
the
day
the
drilling
on
south
georgia
island
was
proceeding
around
the
clock
the
best
estimates
were
that
the
drilling
would
break
through
into
the
roof
of
the
naval
base
in
about
three
weeks
on
or
about
april
if
help
did
not
reach
south
georgia
by
then
the
secret
installation
might
be
doomed
the
forces
stationed
at
the
installation
itself
were
unable
to
defend
themselves
under
the
circumstances
their
mighty
naval
ships
were
ships
in
a
bottle
they
did
not
dare
open
the
bottle
to
sail
out
to
fight
because
the
russian
commandos
were
armed
with
tactical
and
nuclear
weapons
to
open
the
blastproof
entrance
doors
would
be
suicide
on
april
just
two
days
after
south
georgia
island
was
seized
some
naval
ships
began
moving
out
of
british
ports
the
same
day
lord
carrington
was
sacked
as
foreign
minister
he
was
forced
to
resign
my
friends
because
he
had
assisted
the
rockefeller
attack
plan
by
downplaying
the
argentine
attack
preparations
that
same
day
april
new
zealand
the
home
of
the
other
secret
naval
fleet
broke
diplomatic
relations
with
argentina
the
two
hidden
new
zealand
facilities
had
been
placed
on
red
alert
as
a
precautionary
measure
all
submarines
at
the
twin
base
were
ordered
to
sea
several
surface
ships
were
already
at
sea
undergoing
sea
trials
but
that
still
left
seven
major
ships
inside
the
hidden
twin
naval
base
including
one
of
the
nuclear
aircraft
carriers
i
mentioned
earlier
on
that
busy
day
of
april
argentinas
foreign
minister
costa
mendez
was
at
the
united
nations
in
new
york
he
was
alarmed
by
the
deployment
of
such
a
large
part
of
the
royal
navy
costa
mendez
hurried
here
to
washington
to
seek
reassurances
from
certain
officials
he
got
them
for
the
next
two
weeks
or
so
the
news
was
filled
with
stories
about
the
allegedly
slow
movement
of
the
british
fleet
while
negotiations
went
on
that
my
friends
was
only
a
cover
story
the
royal
navy
was
actually
joining
up
and
moving
as
rapidly
as
possible
toward
south
georgia
island
if
the
task
force
arrived
in
time
to
save
the
secret
base
a
major
battle
was
likely
the
official
stories
about
slow
movement
of
the
british
armada
were
intended
to
give
a
cushion
of
time
for
that
battle
if
need
be
the
fleet
would
have
several
days
to
retake
south
georgia
island
then
it
could
move
on
to
arrive
near
the
falklands
on
the
announced
schedule
in
this
way
the
crucial
importance
of
south
georgia
island
would
be
hidden
and
the
big
secret
preserved
it
was
initially
expected
that
advance
elements
of
the
british
fleet
would
reach
the
vicinity
of
south
georgia
island
within
two
weeks
that
would
have
been
soon
enough
to
attack
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
commando
team
and
stop
the
drilling
before
it
was
completed
but
russian
cosmospheres
and
submarines
made
a
shambles
of
the
plan
key
advance
elements
of
the
south
georgia
attack
contingent
left
ascension
island
early
april
two
days
before
it
was
announced
officially
shortly
after
they
did
so
they
ran
into
trouble
russian
cosmospheres
and
attack
submarines
closed
in
on
a
single
ship
which
was
critical
to
the
planned
counterassault
on
south
georgia
island
the
cosmospheres
bombarded
the
bridge
and
combat
information
center
of
the
ship
with
neutron
radiation
in
moments
the
ship
was
without
any
command
its
communications
and
radar
silenced
then
a
russian
sub
closed
in
and
quickly
finished
off
this
key
british
ship
with
torpedoes
it
broke
apart
with
secondary
explosions
and
sank
rapidly
so
far
as
is
known
there
were
no
survivors
this
unexpected
shock
in
the
midatlantic
produced
two
results
both
important
first
it
caused
a
slowdown
in
the
race
toward
the
south
atlantic
by
the
british
armada
the
task
force
had
to
be
regrouped
into
a
configuration
better
suited
for
an
enroute
defense
but
that
cost
valuable
time
public
announcements
from
london
about
the
progress
of
the
fleet
reflected
this
slowdown
the
timetable
for
arrival
on
battle
stations
near
the
falklands
started
stretching
out
longer
and
longer
all
this
bought
extra
time
for
the
joint
commando
team
on
south
georgia
island
the
drilling
continued
the
other
result
of
the
sinking
was
equally
important
word
was
flashed
to
the
south
pacific
stealth
navy
to
prepare
for
possible
action
it
was
obvious
that
the
russian
navy
was
getting
involved
in
the
atlantic
which
meant
that
the
royal
navy
could
be
in
big
trouble
during
the
dead
of
night
early
april
the
seven
stealth
ships
put
to
sea
from
their
twin
secret
bases
in
southern
new
zealand
they
deployed
to
a
secret
operational
headquarters
area
in
the
antipodes
islands
miles
southeast
of
new
zealand
their
electromagnetic
shields
were
operating
to
provide
protection
from
attack
these
shields
make
it
impossible
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world
or
even
to
see
it
as
i
explained
last
month
but
once
they
arrived
at
the
antipodes
the
stealth
ships
hooked
up
to
buoys
equipped
with
shielded
communication
cables
to
the
island
headquarters
the
antipodes
headquarters
in
turn
was
in
constant
touch
with
the
south
georgia
base
by
way
of
a
transoceanic
cable
around
the
tip
of
south
america
the
deployment
of
the
available
ships
of
the
south
pacific
stealth
fleet
was
exactly
what
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
planners
had
hoped
for
the
ships
had
been
flushed
out
from
their
essentially
invulnerable
hiding
place
in
new
zealand
the
british
ships
sinking
of
april
was
also
followed
by
other
events
on
april
the
argentine
navy
started
moving
out
of
port
the
same
day
alexander
haig
arrived
again
in
buenos
aires
supposedly
he
was
there
as
a
diplomat
but
in
reality
he
was
there
as
a
general
dealing
with
generals
haig
is
the
top
governmental
operative
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
as
i
have
revealed
in
the
past
he
was
making
sure
that
the
argentines
did
not
get
cold
feet
and
back
down
at
that
critical
moment
four
days
later
april
haig
left
for
washington
as
he
boarded
his
plane
haig
somberly
told
reporters
time
is
running
out
and
so
it
was
my
friends
for
the
secret
south
georgia
base
the
very
next
day
april
the
drill
broke
through
into
the
hollowedout
cavern
of
the
naval
base
bolshevik
military
analysts
in
london
had
not
expected
that
it
could
be
completed
until
at
least
the
following
weekend
the
british
fleet
was
still
out
of
range
the
weapon
which
the
commando
team
inserted
down
through
the
long
hole
was
a
small
compact
russian
neutron
bomb
when
it
was
detonated
inside
the
confines
of
the
huge
artificial
cave
the
effects
were
devastating
the
intense
radiation
instantly
killed
everyone
inside
the
base
also
the
heat
and
blast
effects
of
the
bomb
are
believed
to
have
damaged
all
the
ships
inside
sufficiently
to
badly
disable
them
meanwhile
russian
cosmospheres
and
submarines
were
converging
on
the
stealth
ships
which
were
near
the
antipodes
islands
awaiting
orders
from
a
distance
the
ships
were
invisible
to
the
eye
due
to
their
protective
shields
which
also
protect
against
beamweapon
attack
but
they
were
sitting
ducks
for
the
tactics
which
the
russians
employed
floating
overhead
the
cosmospheres
located
the
seven
ships
using
their
psychoenergetic
rangefinding
equipment
known
as
prf
as
i
have
reported
in
the
past
there
is
no
method
known
by
which
prf
can
be
jammed
the
cosmospheres
radioed
the
exact
locations
of
the
ships
to
the
attack
submarines
the
subs
were
armed
with
special
nonhoming
nonnuclear
torpedoes
designed
to
explode
on
impact
more
sophisticated
torpedoes
would
have
been
thrown
off
course
or
detonated
prematurely
by
the
protective
shield
of
each
ship
but
these
simple
torpedoes
just
cruise
right
through
each
invisibility
field
to
strike
the
ship
and
explode
within
minutes
after
the
attack
began
all
seven
bolshevik
stealth
ships
were
on
their
way
to
the
bottom
and
with
them
went
their
bolshevik
commanders
and
mercenary
crews
collected
from
around
the
world
the
south
pacific
action
took
place
just
after
sunset
local
time
the
time
here
in
washington
was
around
pm
april
that
evening
secretary
of
state
haig
was
seen
briefly
in
public
with
the
new
british
foreign
minister
francis
pym
pym
was
wearing
the
artificial
pseudosmile
which
diplomats
are
taught
always
to
display
in
public
but
not
haig
haig
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
no
wonder
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
military
operation
had
been
a
brilliant
success
the
secret
bolshevik
south
atlantic
fleet
had
been
virtually
wiped
out
bottled
up
inside
south
georgia
island
and
the
south
pacific
fleet
while
not
totally
wiped
out
had
been
badly
crippled
by
working
together
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
had
won
the
secret
naval
war
of
the
southern
hemisphere
topic
i
say
these
words
news
reports
give
the
impression
that
war
is
about
to
erupt
in
the
south
atlantic
but
the
real
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
is
already
over
what
we
are
watching
now
is
the
beginning
of
its
bloody
aftermath
that
aftermath
is
the
battle
for
the
falkland
islands
they
have
been
promised
to
argentina
as
a
reward
for
her
role
in
the
secret
war
at
this
moment
the
bolsheviks
here
in
washington
are
pressing
for
a
public
announcement
that
the
united
states
will
side
with
britain
as
soon
as
that
takes
place
military
action
will
heat
up
fast
around
the
falklands
britain
has
no
choice
but
to
fight
she
has
already
suffered
casualties
which
cannot
be
explained
without
a
public
battle
but
by
fighting
the
bolsheviks
in
britain
are
running
the
risk
of
a
humiliating
and
tragic
defeat
for
the
royal
navy
meanwhile
the
rockefeller
strategists
here
are
now
concentrating
on
a
fastbuilding
antinuclearwar
campaign
on
all
sides
now
we
are
hearing
about
the
socalled
nuclear
freeze
movement
there
are
documentaries
articles
publicity
of
all
kinds
to
sensitize
us
to
the
terrors
of
nuclear
war
in
recent
months
there
have
even
been
referenda
popping
up
on
election
ballots
dealing
with
the
nuclear
war
issue
medical
doctors
are
banding
together
to
warn
the
public
about
what
would
happen
if
there
were
a
nuclear
war
we
are
being
told
that
all
this
is
just
popping
up
spontaneously
we
are
now
years
into
the
nuclear
age
and
nothing
like
this
has
ever
gained
so
much
momentum
before
yet
now
we
are
supposed
to
believe
that
millions
of
americans
have
spontaneously
gotten
the
same
ideas
at
the
same
time
if
you
believe
that
my
friends
i
give
up
movements
like
this
never
and
i
mean
never
develop
without
leadership
organization
and
moneyand
plenty
of
it
what
we
are
watching
is
the
rockefeller
public
relations
machine
at
work
as
ive
explained
in
the
past
the
rockefeller
cartel
cannot
afford
to
let
a
nuclear
war
take
place
if
it
does
they
will
lose
everything
because
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
control
it
instead
the
deadly
enemies
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
the
bolsheviks
here
will
win
out
if
there
is
a
war
and
so
the
rockefeller
faction
is
now
doing
everything
in
its
power
to
prevent
a
nuclear
war
the
present
antinuclearwar
orientation
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
creates
certain
temporary
common
interests
between
them
and
russia
but
as
russias
new
rulers
know
very
well
this
does
not
spring
from
any
great
moral
perspective
on
the
part
of
the
rockefeller
group
its
purely
a
matter
of
practical
necessity
right
now
for
the
rockefellers
the
russians
regard
the
united
states
as
a
house
divided
and
they
are
exploiting
that
division
by
working
in
careful
ways
with
the
rockefellers
their
first
priority
is
to
rid
the
world
of
the
deadly
bolshevik
menace
of
allout
even
suicidal
nuclear
war
but
once
that
is
done
they
know
that
there
will
be
a
day
of
reckoning
with
the
rockefeller
cartel
some
day
the
rockefeller
group
is
working
toward
a
definite
objective
with
their
new
antinuclearwar
propaganda
that
objective
is
renewed
powerand
power
that
moves
them
closer
to
their
old
dream
of
world
government
the
bolsheviks
here
have
unwittingly
provided
fertile
ground
for
the
powerful
new
rockefeller
antiwar
campaign
under
bolshevik
control
the
socalled
reagan
administration
has
become
so
hawkish
that
its
scaring
people
the
rockefeller
antiwar
campaign
is
designed
to
capitalize
on
that
latent
fear
as
a
tool
of
power
these
days
the
smell
of
war
is
in
the
air
the
falklands
crisis
is
helping
to
make
that
more
intense
the
rockefeller
propaganda
machine
is
now
paving
the
way
for
the
argument
that
surrender
of
sovereignty
is
the
only
way
to
avoid
war
a
new
superunited
nations
of
sorts
is
now
in
the
works
to
fill
the
bill
it
will
have
teeth
as
presently
envisioned
the
new
organization
will
be
based
in
geneva
switzerland
the
working
name
though
this
may
be
changed
is
the
world
nonproliferation
council
the
plan
is
to
bring
it
into
being
as
the
outgrowth
of
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaties
but
its
true
purpose
will
be
to
use
fearthe
fear
of
warto
control
us
all
last
minute
summary
now
its
time
for
my
last
minute
summary
in
this
audio
letter
i
have
reported
on
the
reasons
behind
the
socalled
falkland
islands
crisis
the
crisis
erupted
because
of
secret
bolshevikcontrolled
naval
installations
in
the
southern
hemisphere
these
have
been
attacked
by
joint
action
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
in
an
attempt
to
slow
down
the
nuclearwar
timetable
the
attacks
were
successful
but
the
results
remain
to
be
seen
one
result
though
is
that
the
royal
navy
has
now
been
drawn
into
a
trap
britains
waterloo
at
sea
may
well
be
at
hand
my
friends
two
factions
are
struggling
for
control
over
our
united
statesthe
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
bolsheviks
they
differ
in
style
but
both
seek
to
control
us
through
fear
if
we
are
ever
to
rise
above
their
trickery
it
must
be
through
the
power
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
our
only
hope
as
the
scripture
tells
us
our
lord
has
not
given
us
the
spirit
of
fear
but
of
power
of
love
and
of
a
sound
mind
we
must
learn
to
wage
peace
as
our
lord
declared
long
ago
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
sons
of

please

report

some

unlawful
sexual

the

q
i
had
two
questions
for
both
presidents
so
you
could
probably
answer
for
boris
too
laughter
the
president
ill
give
you
my
answer
then
ill
give
you
yeltsins
answer
laughter
q
the
first
is
that
this
is
the
meeting
of
the
presidents
so
the
money
thats
being
promised
is
government
money
and
naturally
its
going
to
be
distributed
through
the
government
but
youve
indicated
that
threequarters
are
going
to
be
going
to
businesses
so
the
question
is
how
the
russian
businesses
themselves
are
going
to
be
consulted
if
ever
what
are
the
priorities
because
there
are
several
association
of
russian
businessmen
existing
already
so
will
they
be
invited
to
participate
in
setting
up
priorities
for
investment
this
is
the
first
and
second
to
you
we
know
that
polls
public
polls
in
america
do
not
show
that
americans
are
very
enthusiastic
about
giving
this
aid
like
newsweek
polls
say
that
about
percent
dont
approve
it
and
new
york
times
published
that
percent
support
if
it
just
prevents
civil
war
percent
if
it
fosters
democratic
reform
and
only
percent
if
it
just
personally
supports
yeltsin
how
are
you
going
to
sort
of
handle
this
problem
that
americans
themselves
are
not
very
enthusiastic
thank
you
q
i
have
a
question
im
sorry
is
there
going
to
be
a
translation
of
everything
into
russian
no
just
the
answers
just
the
answers
okay
the
president
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
aid
were
discussing
for
example
the
funds
that
will
be
set
up
for
financing
new
businesses
will
obviously
go
to
those
businesses
who
apply
and
who
seem
to
be
good
risks
and
make
the
application
the
privatization
fund
will
be
used
to
support
the
privatization
of
existing
public
enterprises
then
there
are
some
other
general
funds
in
the
democracy
corps
and
other
things
which
people
in
russia
will
have
some
influence
over
the
distribution
of
with
regard
to
your
second
question
let
me
say
that
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
people
in
both
countries
who
would
not
feel
too
warmly
toward
simply
the
american
government
giving
money
to
the
russian
government
theres
opposition
to
that
in
russia
and
in
our
country
throughout
our
whole
history
there
has
been
an
opposition
to
foreign
aid
of
all
kinds
that
is
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
russia
if
you
look
at
the
whole
history
of
america
any
kind
of
aid
program
has
always
been
unpopular
what
i
have
tried
to
tell
the
american
people
is
is
this
is
not
an
aid
program
this
is
an
investment
program
that
this
is
an
investment
in
our
future
we
spent
trillion
trillion
on
armaments
on
soldiers
and
other
investments
because
of
the
cold
war
now
with
a
democratic
government
in
russia
with
the
newly
independent
states
the
remainder
of
them
working
on
a
democracy
and
struggling
to
get
their
economies
going
it
seems
to
me
very
much
in
our
interest
to
make
it
possible
to
do
whatever
we
can
for
democracy
to
survive
for
the
economy
of
russia
to
grow
because
of
the
potential
for
trade
and
investment
there
and
for
us
to
continue
the
effort
to
reduce
nuclear
weapons
and
other
elements
of
hostility
on
both
sides
on
our
side
and
on
the
russian
side
so
i
dont
see
this
as
an
aid
program
this
is
an
investment
for
the
united
states
this
is
very
much
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
the
things
i
announced
today
the
second
stage
of
the
program
which
i
hope
to
put
together
next
week
in
my
view
are
things
that
are
good
for
my
country
and
for
the
taxpayers
and
workers
of
my
country
russia
is
a
very
great
nation
that
needs
some
partnership
now
some
common
endeavor
with
other
people
who
share
her
goals
but
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
for
anyone
to
view
this
as
some
sort
of
just
a
charity
or
an
aid
issue
thats
not
what
it
is
its
an
investment
for
america
and
its
a
wonderful
investment
like
all
investments
there
is
some
risk
but
theres
far
less
risk
with
a
far
greater
potential
of
return
than
the
trillion
we
spent
looking
at
each
other
across
the
barrier
of
the
cold
war
q
mr
president
first
of
all
thank
you
very
much
indeed
for
coming
here
and
talking
to
us
in
the
memory
of
the
living
correspondents
this
is
the
first
time
an
american
president
is
doing
this
to
the
russian
press
corps
so
its
kind
of
a
very
measured
breakthrough
i
have
two
questions
one
in
your
introductory
remarks
of
the
other
press
conference
you
mentioned
in
brief
that
you
discussed
the
start
ii
and
start
i
issues
could
you
tell
us
did
you
reach
an
agreement
with
president
yeltsin
as
to
what
might
be
done
in
order
to
have
ukraine
join
the
ratification
of
start
i
and
the
npt
regime
and
my
second
question
is
how
confident
you
are
that
the
united
states
congress
would
be
eager
to
support
you
in
lifting
jacksonvanik
and
other
restrictions
inherited
from
the
cold
war
president
clinton
first
we
discussed
the
issue
of
ukraine
with
regard
to
start
i
and
npt
and
generally
with
regard
to
the
need
to
proceed
to
have
the
other
independent
states
all
be
nonnuclear
but
also
to
have
the
united
states
develop
strong
relationships
with
them
we
know
that
one
thing
that
we
could
do
that
would
increase
i
think
the
willingness
of
the
ukraine
to
support
this
direction
is
to
successfully
conclude
our
own
negotiations
on
highly
enriched
uranium
because
that
would
provide
not
only
an
important
economic
opportunity
for
russia
but
also
for
ukraine
and
it
would
show
some
reaching
out
on
our
part
but
we
agreed
that
basically
the
people
who
signed
off
on
the
lisbon
protocol
have
got
to
honor
what
they
did
and
we
agreed
to
continue
to
press
that
i
myself
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
trying
to
reassure
ukraines
leaders
specifically
the
president
and
the
foreign
minister
that
i
want
strong
ties
with
ukraine
that
the
united
states
very
much
wants
a
good
relationship
with
ukraine
but
that
in
order
to
do
what
we
need
to
do
together
to
strengthen
the
economy
of
ukraine
and
to
have
the
united
states
be
fully
supportive
the
commitment
to
ratify
start
i
and
to
join
the
npt
regime
is
critical
what
was
the
second
question
the
president
with
regard
to
jacksonvanik
and
cocom
i
would
make
two
points
first
i
have
agreed
with
the
republican
and
democratic
leaders
in
the
congress
that
we
will
as
soon
as
i
return
have
a
list
of
all
the
legislative
and
other
restrictions
some
of
them
are
regulatory
in
nature
imposed
on
relations
between
the
united
states
and
russia
that
are
legacies
of
the
cold
war
and
we
will
see
whether
theyre
how
many
of
them
we
could
agree
to
do
away
with
right
now
at
least
among
the
leadership
of
the
congress
with
regard
to
jacksonvanik
i
think
there
will
be
an
openness
to
change
the
law
if
the
congress
is
convinced
there
are
in
fact
no
more
refusniks
no
more
people
who
wish
to
emigrate
who
are
not
being
allowed
to
if
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
one
there
who
would
have
been
who
the
law
was
designed
to
affect
then
i
think
that
the
desire
to
keep
the
law
will
be
much
less
with
regard
to
cocom
my
guess
is
and
its
nothing
more
than
a
guess
that
the
leadership
of
congress
and
indeed
my
own
advisers
might
prefer
to
see
some
sort
of
phased
movement
out
of
the
cocom
regime
but
i
think
they
would
be
willing
to
begin
it
in
the
fairly
near
future
q
mr
clinton
when
i
read
your
speech
in
annapolis
i
got
the
impression
that
you
have
a
completely
different
personal
and
i
stress
that
personal
not
political
approach
towards
russia
compared
to
the
approach
of
mr
bush
could
you
formulate
in
a
few
words
what
is
the
difference
between
you
as
a
personality
and
your
approach
the
difference
between
your
approach
to
russia
and
the
approach
of
mr
bush
and
who
made
you
why
did
you
cite
akhmatova
in
the
last
part
of
your
speech
the
president
let
me
say
first
i
do
not
wish
to
compare
myself
with
president
bush
or
anyone
else
i
cant
say
what
was
in
his
heart
about
russia
i
can
say
that
since
i
was
a
boy
i
have
been
personally
fascinated
with
the
history
the
music
and
the
culture
and
the
literature
of
russia
i
have
been
thrilled
by
russian
music
since
i
was
a
serious
student
of
music
for
more
than
years
now
i
have
read
major
russian
novelists
and
many
of
your
poets
and
followed
your
ballet
and
tried
to
know
as
much
as
i
could
about
your
history
and
i
went
to
the
soviet
union
but
it
was
then
the
soviet
union
you
may
know
it
was
a
big
issue
in
the
last
presidential
campaign
that
i
spent
the
first
week
of
alone
in
moscow
and
did
not
return
again
until
three
days
before
mr
yeltsin
was
elected
president
but
all
that
time
i
was
away
i
was
following
events
there
very
closely
and
hoping
for
the
day
when
we
could
be
genuine
partners
so
i
have
always
had
a
personal
feeling
about
russia
i
remember
for
example
a
lot
of
you
know
i
like
music
very
much
one
of
the
most
moving
experiences
for
me
as
a
musician
was
when
leonard
bernstein
took
the
new
york
philharmonic
to
moscow
and
played
shostakovichs
fifth
symphony
to
the
russians
and
he
played
the
last
movement
more
rapidly
than
anyone
had
ever
played
it
before
because
it
was
technically
so
difficult
that
is
something
i
followed
very
closely
when
it
occurred
these
are
things
that
have
always
had
a
big
impact
on
my
life
and
i
had
just
always
hoped
that
someday
if
i
ever
had
the
chance
to
i
could
play
a
role
in
seeing
our
two
countries
become
closer
partners

i

do

two

here
first
white

dont
do
anything
as
a
class
individual
white
males
invented
those
things
which
means
nothing
to
white
males
as
a
whole
second
you
neglected
to
mention
charles
manson
hitler
mccarthy
jack
the
ripper
ted
bundy
and
a
whole
slew
of
individuals
who
have
done
horrible
evil
things
if
white
males
can
take
the
credit
for
our
fellow
white
males
boons
we
must
also
take
the
blame
for
our
fellows
blights
i
claim
we
deserve
neither
credit
nor
blame
for
these
things
white
males
need
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
theyre
being
unfair
yes
but
everyone
else
needs
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
being
unfair
right
back
is
disgusting
racist
and
sexist
why
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyone
fairly
without
generalizing
what
stupidity
gene
makes
this
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
missing
in
this
whole
discourse
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
words
it
is
the
l
word
loser
thats
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
this
argument
it
is
all
about
winning
and
losing
and
nothing
else
let
me
explain
in
the
meantime
there
is
guilt
for
winning
maybe
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserve
ones
bounty
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
days
bill
clinton
affirmative
action
and
lots
of
discourse
about
people
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
us
in
the
winning
business
this
kind
of
talk
is
mildly
irritating
but
there
is
still
no
suggestion
of
losing
who
is
dfens
anyway
the
answer
is
as
plain
as
the
horn
rims
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
douglas
posing
as
a
loser
this
is
known
as
controversial
casting
but
that
baggy
shortsleeved
white
shirt
sure
does
look
natural
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woody
always
dressed
that
way
did
we
really
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrobe
without
putting
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
starting
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bashing
dfens
is
the
same
game
as
bashing
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
used
to
blow
away
all
the
time
as
that
archwasp
male
gender
george
c
scott
declaimed
americans
traditionally
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
tolerate
a
loser
and
so
on
since
we
are
talking
in
theory
and
opinion
then
ill
put
in
my
first
a
rebuttle
personally
i
love
underdogs
unlike
bandwagon
jumpers
i
abandon
teams
when
they
start
winning
people
that
cheer
for
winners
just
because
they
are
winners
are
insecure
people
who
are
afraid
to
be
associated
with
something
negative
the
political
implications
are
simple
if
as
many
socialists
and
democrats
do
you
consider
society
a
finite
pie
to
a
apportioned
in
some
equitable
way
then
you
have
to
worry
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
women
today
asian
homosexuals
tommorrow
and
yes
indeed
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determined
day
when
the
balance
of
the
pie
has
finally
swung
against
that
minority
on
this
one
point
i
agree
the
reason
that
people
bash
wasps
is
because
they
have
been
on
top
for
a
long
time
whoever
is
on
top
is
going
to
oppress
whoever
is
below
them
so
that
they
can
stay
on
top
if
hannibal
had
pushed
on
to
rome
after
his
victory
at
cannae
we
might
all
be
bashing
the
blacks
for
oppressing
us
peacefull
white
people
for
all
these
centuries
i
seriously
doubt
that
if
the
blacks
had
conquered
the
world
that
they
would
have
treated
their
colonies
any
betterworse
than
the
whites
did
the
white
race
did
some
unspeakable
things
to
the
other
races
of
the
world
but
they
only
did
what
any
other
conquering
race
would
have
done
ie
khan
the
real
question
is
should
we
carry
over
that
blame
to
the
present
generation
who
didnt
participate
in
the
crimes
would
it
do
any
good
has
it
done
bosnia
any
good
they
are
fighting
wars
that
stopped
hundreds
even
thousands
of
years
ago
my
opinion
is
if
there
are
inequities
now
then
lets
change
them
but
dont
blame
me
for
what
my
ancestors
did
it
wouldnt
settle
anything
anyway
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduate
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunions
but
it
beats
being
a
nerd
as
i
would
imagine
michael
douglas
would
now
agree
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
only
way
to
go
thats
where
you
are
dead
wrong
you
dont
join
up
on
a
side
just
because
they
are
winning
that
makes
you
spineless
winning
in
high
school
and
after
high
school
is
still
the
best
way
to
be
popular
but
it
doesnt
make
you
right
all
the
best
causes
in
history
were
loosing
causes
with
only
a
couple
exceptions
winning
only
makes
a
difference
to
other
people
not
to
yourself
and
what
good
is
the
opinions
of
other
people
if
they
only
care
how
you
appear
ie
a
winner
if
you
cant
beat
them
fight
them

inch

the

package
our
jobs
package
needs
to
be
passed
as
quickly
as
possible
we
need
this
investment
for
summer
jobs
for
immunization
for
highway
construction
for
the
important
programs
that
will
put
people
back
to
work
right
away
this
summer
and
the
president
continues
to
believe
his
program
should
be
passed
q
will
he
compromise
thats
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
well
as
you
know
the
discussions
are
going
on
this
morning
in
the
senate
betwen
senator
mitchell
and
senator
dole
lets
see
what
they
come
up
with
but
the
president
believes
his
jobs
program
should
go
forward
q
george
would
the
president
be
willing
to
accept
billion
for
one
year
which
apparently
appears
to
be
the
compromise
being
offered
by
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
what
is
being
offered
by
either
side
the
senate
discussions
are
going
on
right
now
lets
see
what
happens
today
q
would
he
go
that
far
no
matter
what
the
republicans
have
offered
so
far
would
he
go
that
far
billion
per
year
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
his
program
should
be
passed
at
this
time
clearly
were
going
to
be
willing
to
listen
to
what
the
senators
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
come
up
with
but
im
not
going
to
get
into
figures
right
now
lets
see
what
happens
q
its
reasonable
to
assume
isnt
it
from
what
has
happened
so
far
that
a
compromise
is
going
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
get
a
vote
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
seem
more
intrested
in
stopping
progress
on
the
presidents
jobs
bill
than
in
doing
something
to
create
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
seem
more
interested
in
stopping
progress
on
the
presidents
jobs
bill
than
in
doing
something
to
create
real
action
real
jobs
this
summer
for
the
american
people
i
think
theres
no
question
about
that
theres
been
some
frustration
of
legislative
activity
over
the
last
few
days
q
so
youll
need
to
compromise
to
get
your
package
through
mr
stephanopoulos
well
see
what
happens
with
the
conversations
between
senator
mitchell
and
senator
dole
this
morning
q
prepared
to
compromise
mr
stephanopoulos
the
presidents
prepared
to
listen
to
what
senator
mitchell
has
to
say
this
morning
after
his
meeting
with
senator
dole
q
does
he
feel
that
he
has
been
defeated
in
his
mr
stephanopoulos
not
in
the
least
in
fact
hes
been
very
successful
so
far
in
the
beginning
of
his
term
q
how
mr
stephanopoulos
he
passed
his
budget
in
record
time
in
six
weeks
and
its
a
budget
which
reduces
the
deficit
by
billion
over
five
years
and
its
a
budget
which
provides
for
important
investments
in
our
future
right
now
weve
also
had
strong
passage
of
his
jobs
program
through
the
house
simply
because
a
minority
of
republicans
in
the
senate
choose
to
perpetuate
gridlock
and
hold
up
action
on
the
presidents
jobs
program
is
not
a
sign
that
he
is
not
succeeding
overall
q
he
cant
beat
this
can
he
q
the
fact
is
they
can
do
that
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
can
stop
action
theres
no
question
about
that
q
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
q
george
what
do
you
know
about
these
alleged
notes
taken
by
boris
yeltsin
during
one
of
the
meetings
in
which
it
appears
that
the
president
told
boris
yeltsin
not
to
trust
the
japanese
that
when
they
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
a
complete
misreading
of
what
happened
at
the
meeting
the
context
of
the
conversation
was
that
president
clinton
was
actually
reassuring
president
yeltsin
at
the
time
about
his
conversations
with
prime
minister
miyazawa
over
the
kuril
islands
and
the
prime
ministers
belief
that
japan
would
play
a
constructive
role
in
the
process
i
mean
this
was
a
casual
comment
about
japanese
courtesy
and
etiquette
but
overall
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
conversation
where
he
was
reassuring
president
yeltsin
that
he
believed
the
japanese
were
serious
about
their
commitment
to
the
process
q
are
you
saying
that
the
president
said
that
when
the
japanese
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
not
i
dont
know
the
exact
words
and
there
was
a
much
longer
discussion
about
he
did
say
something
along
the
lines
that
he
believes
that
on
this
issue
prime
minister
miyazawa
intends
to
really
go
forward
with
the
process
q
have
there
been
any
attempts
to
explain
this
to
the
japanese
because
apparently
the
japanese
press
has
picked
this
up
and
there
appears
to
be
mr
stephanopoulos
ive
seen
the
reports
in
the
japanese
press
and
it
actually
does
put
the
situation
in
context
it
does
talk
about
the
japanese
understanding
the
japanese
points
of
view
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
a
problem
i
believe
that
there
may
have
been
some
diplomatic
context
just
to
clear
things
up
but
im
not
positive
q
george
was
the
specific
comment
that
was
made
specific
to
the
kuril
island
situation
or
was
it
a
general
observation
on
japanese
etiquette
mr
stephanopoulos
the
discussion
was
about
q
the
specific
comment
is
what
im
asking
about
that
has
alleged
to
have
been
translated
from
the
russian
notes
when
the
japanese
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
well
it
was
a
combination
i
mean
i
dont
think
thats
the
whole
sentence
i
think
that
the
specific
comment
was
a
broad
general
observation
followed
up
by
a
specific
finish
to
the
sentence
where
he
said
in
this
case
he
believes
that
prime
minister
miyazawa
means
to
keep
the
commitment
q
was
he
saying
it
facetiously
first
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
just
a
casual
observation
q
and
then
you
say
diplomatic
contacts
were
made
to
clear
it
up
has
the
president
sent
a
message
mr
stephanopoulos
no
i
dont
think
the
president
spoke
i
believe
that
secretary
christopher
has
made
some
calls
but
im
not
sure
exactly
how
many
q
well
this
obviously
is
a
bigger
deal
than
youre
making
it
out
to
be
if
christopher
has
had
to
make
some
calls
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
it
was
just
that
we
got
the
reports
in
vancouver
and
the
secretary
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
understood
and
make
sure
there
was
absolutely
no
mr
stephanopoulos
reports
in
vancouver
and
the
secretary
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
understood
and
make
sure
there
is
absolutely
no
misunderstanding
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
on
q
what
is
our
position
about
the
japanese
that
they
may
have
to
say
one
thing
but
actualy
mean
another
mr
stephanopoulos
no
the
position
on
the
japanese
is
as
the
president
stated
to
president
yeltsin
throughout
the
two
days
he
said
that
he
had
had
a
good
conversation
with
prime
minister
miazawa
prior
to
the
summit
he
reiterated
the
us
position
the
longstanding
support
for
the
japanese
position
on
the
kuril
islands
but
also
reiterated
prime
minister
miazawas
commitment
to
move
forward
on
the
process
and
to
play
a
constructive
role
and
i
think
president
yeltsin
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
q
after
listening
to
secretary
christopher
on
iraq
for
the
last
few
days
im
a
little
confused
what
is
the
us
policy
do
you
want
to
see
saddam
hussein
overturned
mr
stephanopoulos
its
the
same
policy
that
secretary
christopher
has
reiterated
and
all
of
the
us
officials
have
reiterated
we
expect
full
and
complete
and
unequivocal
compliance
with
all
un
resolutions
right
now
we
do
not
have
that
compliance
q
throwing
it
out
further
that
if
iraq
complies
saddam
cant
stay
in
office
mr
stephanopoulos
right
i
think
that
thats
our
judgment
is
that
it
is
not
possible
for
saddam
hussein
to
comply
with
the
resolutions
and
stay
in
power
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
expect
compliance
by
iraq
with
all
un
resolutions
and
we
will
continue
to
demand
it
q
and
are
you
concerned
the
iran
will
become
the
dominant
power
in
the
area
mr
stephanopoulos
secretary
christopher
has
also
spoken
to
iran
over
the
last
several
days
and
he
says
we
also
expect
full
iranian
compliance
with
all
international
norms
and
stopping
support
of
terrorism
q
thats
a
very
glib
statement
that
he
wont
stay
in
power
if
he
complies
with
un
resolutions
on
what
logic
do
you
base
that
mr
stephanopoulos
right
now
saddam
hussein
is
not
complying
with
the
un
resolutions
at
all
he
is
not
respecting
the
rights
of
his
people
as
is
required
by
the
un
resolution
he
is
not
fully
complying
with
all
the
resolutions
regarding
inspections
he
is
not
fully
complying
with
all
the
resolutions
regarding
armaments
q
well
when
do
you
think
that
if
he
did
comply
he
would
be
out
of
power
mr
stephanopoulos
well
right
now
his
power
rests
on
the
repression
of
his
people
if
he
stopped
doing
that
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
stay
in
power
q
george
back
on
the
stimulus
package
why
is
it
that
you
and
the
president
accuse
the
republicans
of
playing
pure
politics
and
perpetuating
gridlock
why
is
it
that
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
they
just
dont
have
a
genuine
idealogical
difference
with
you
thats
in
good
faith
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
fact
that
several
times
in
the
past
the
republicans
many
of
the
ones
who
are
now
leading
the
fight
for
the
filibuster
have
supported
the
very
funding
they
now
seek
to
stop
most
especially
the
highway
funding
q
george
in
regards
to
that
some
of
the
moderate
republicans
said
that
the
white
house
erred
by
not
being
more
open
to
them
during
the
while
the
plan
was
put
together
that
they
had
one
sort
of
proforma
meeting
between
the
white
house
and
the
senate
republicans
and
that
was
it
does
the
administration
look
back
and
thinks
perhaps
it
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
working
with
some
mr
stephanopoulos
well
im
not
sure
that
its
true
that
there
was
only
one
meeting
i
mean
the
president
met
with
the
republican
leadership
on
at
least
two
occasions
before
the
introduction
of
his
package
he
met
with
the
entire
senate
republican
caucus
also
for
lunch
and
went
up
there
we
are
continually
in
contact
with
as
many
republicans
as
we
can
find
who
have
an
interest
in
the
presidents
package
we
are
interested
in
what
they
have
to
say
as
well
but
we
believe
that
this
program
is
important
and
were
going
to
continue
to
fight
for
it
q
your
all
or
nothing
do
it
with
the
democrats
alone
strategy
did
you
maybe
miscalculate
the
ability
to
get
it
through
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
senate
rules
a
determined
minority
can
frustrate
activity
i
mean
there
is
just
no
question
about
that
you
only
need
plus
one
to
keep
going
plus
one
to
keep
going
and
to
stop
any
action
and
thats
what
the
republicans
are
doing
q
going
to
rethink
the
way
you
attempt
to
get
other
things
passed
as
you
go
through
this
process
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
q
work
with
republicans
and
try
to
woo
some
republicans
into
your
camp
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
were
going
to
continue
to
look
for
the
support
of
republicans
whenever
we
can
get
it
on
the
presidents
intiatives
q
but
on
this
one
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
differently
than
you
did
it
on
this
one
because
on
this
one
you
really
did
stiff
the
republicans
from
the
beginning
and
made
it
clear
that
it
was
a
democratic
majority
that
would
get
this
through
and
could
get
it
through
and
you
really
didnt
need
republican
votes
are
you
going
to
take
a
different
tack
when
you
have
to
go
for
particular
votes
when
you
have
to
go
through
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
see
into
the
future
and
understand
every
possible
turn
in
the
legislative
road
clearly
the
presidents
going
to
continue
to
reach
out
when
he
can
q
you
dont
have
any
regrets
then
about
the
way
you
have
handled
it
up
to
now
and
you
dont
plan
any
changes
in
your
approach
in
dealing
with
the
republicans
in
congress
based
on
this
experience
mr
stephanopoulos
obviously
the
president
would
like
his
package
passed
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hes
going
to
continue
to
press
for
that
we
will
continue
to
reach
out
to
republicans
theres
not
question
about
that
and
well
continue
to
reason
with
them
and
try
and
find
appropriate
avenues
for
cooperation
in
this
case
the
republicans
have
chosen
to
unify
around
a
filibuster
around
a
plan
to
frustrate
action
not
a
plan
to
move
forward
q
theyre
being
denied
any
other
legislative
means
of
putting
their
proposals
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theyre
being
q
any
ideas
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
their
amendments
are
being
defeated
i
dont
know
that
theyre
being
denied
q
to
present
them
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
not
exactly
true
i
mean
they
get
the
votes
q
that
theirs
can
be
passed
though
by
the
parliamentary
rules
under
which
theyre
playing
mr
stephanopoulos
unless
they
get
a
majority
in
support
all
the
way
around
no
thats
not
exactly
true
q
george
one
more
on
iraq
is
the
administration
backing
any
of
the
iraqi
opposition
grooming
any
new
leadership
q
backing
any
of
the
iraqi
leadership
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
i
again
were
pressing
for
iraqi
compliance
i
dont
know
if
we
can
get
into
the
business
of
grooming
leadership
i
believe
there
have
been
some
contacts
at
some
levels
with
iraqi
opposition
groups
i
dont
know
about
anything
recently
q
jesse
jackson
who
of
course
is
not
the
presidents
best
friend
has
however
been
told
that
there
is
to
be
some
kind
of
town
meeting
or
some
kind
of
involvement
by
the
president
preempted
the
ball
game
los
angeles
will
he
consider
something
like
that
or
any
other
kind
of
intervention
there
mr
stephanopoulos
well
as
you
know
the
president
appointed
commerce
secretary
ron
brown
about
days
ago
to
be
a
special
envoy
to
california
and
coordiante
cabinet
activities
around
the
california
economic
situation
including
the
situation
in
los
angeles
i
believe
there
will
also
be
visits
out
to
los
angeles
by
the
education
or
have
been
visits
by
the
education
secretary
mr
riley
i
believe
that
transportation
secretary
pena
and
hud
secretary
cisneros
are
also
going
out
and
there
may
be
other
visits
by
cabinet
officials
over
the
next
several
days
and
weeks
i
wouldnt
rule
out
the
possibility
of
a
visit
by
president
clinton
to
california
obviously
he
is
following
the
situation
closely
and
is
concerned
about
making
sure
that
we
make
the
right
long
term
policy
decisions
that
will
help
create
the
kind
of
economic
opportunities
which
help
prevent
disturbances
but
were
going
to
continue
to
watch
it
q
george
as
a
followup
reverend
jackson
is
also
supposed
to
be
outside
the
ball
park
today
in
baltimore
with
a
group
of
supporters
protesting
the
lack
of
minorities
in
baseball
management
does
the
president
have
a
position
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
received
correspondence
from
reverend
jackson
i
know
that
reverend
jackson
has
also
spoken
with
the
white
house
chief
of
staff
mack
mclarty
he
clearly
raises
serious
questions
there
has
been
some
progress
in
baseball
over
the
last
several
years
but
still
not
enough
but
the
president
intends
to
continue
to
go
to
the
ball
game
q
is
he
going
to
say
anything
about
it
today
or
see
reverend
jackson
while
hes
out
there
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
he
is
going
to
see
them
but
as
i
said
the
president
believes
that
reverend
jackson
has
raised
some
serious
questions
and
its
something
that
as
i
said
even
though
there
has
been
progress
its
clearly
not
enough
q
did
reverend
jackson
ask
him
not
to
go
to
the
ball
game
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
about
that
i
believe
the
characterization
the
reverend
jackson
is
talking
about
is
an
informational
pickett
i
dont
know
that
he
asked
him
not
to
go
to
the
ball
game
but
he
sent
a
long
detailed
formal
letter
outlining
his
concerns
with
the
situation
in
major
league
baseball
and
the
president
read
it
q
george
the
orioles
are
playing
the
rangers
the
managing
partner
of
the
rangers
is
george
w
bush
is
he
going
to
be
there
and
is
he
going
to
meet
with
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
q
what
is
the
mubarak
schedule
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
that
president
mubarak
is
coming
tomorrow
morning
for
a
working
meeting
they
will
have
a
lunch
and
i
believe
that
he
is
having
dinner
tonight
with
vice
president
gore
q
and
joint
statements
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
so
yes
at
the
end
yes
q
is
there
evidence
george
that
the
egyptians
did
warn
the
us
about
a
potential
terrorist
bombing
terrorist
activities
mr
stephanopoulos
as
reported
in
the
new
york
times
i
mean
i
think
that
president
mubarak
did
say
that
there
has
been
general
conversations
with
the
egyptians
as
there
have
been
for
a
long
period
of
time
we
do
have
general
intelligence
sharing
i
mean
but
president
mubarak
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
specific
information
on
this
visit
that
was
passed
forward
the
president
will
continue
to
investigate
the
situation
but
he
also
reiterates
his
belief
that
we
cannot
tolerate
terrorism
of
any
kind
q
george
he
did
make
specific
or
the
egyptians
apparently
did
issue
specific
warnings
about
this
individual
who
forgive
me
this
individual
who
forgive
me
the
name
escapes
me
at
the
moment
and
said
the
egyptians
were
more
or
less
rebuffed
in
their
attempts
to
get
some
kind
of
action
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
if
i
would
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
mubarak
interview
he
did
say
that
they
gave
general
warnings
about
the
possibility
of
a
network
in
the
united
states
and
upon
which
we
took
appropriate
action
but
there
was
no
specific
information
on
this
specific
operation
at
all
q
so
the
white
house
doesnt
feel
that
any
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
whether
it
be
the
cia
or
fbi
who
would
have
received
this
kind
of
information
was
lax
or
derelict
in
its
duty
in
not
pursuing
some
kind
of
mr
stephanopoulos
no
not
at
all
q
whats
next
with
serbia
it
got
only
a
passing
mention
in
the
news
conference
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
you
didnt
get
to
ask
your
question
q
yes
exactly
was
there
any
agreement
on
concerted
action
between
the
two
countries
and
even
if
there
wasnt
what
does
the
us
do
next
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
us
is
clearly
going
to
move
forward
in
the
un
today
continuing
discussions
with
our
allies
on
a
sanctions
resolution
and
well
continue
to
look
for
ways
to
press
the
serbians
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
and
sign
an
agreement
q
george
why
do
you
think
sanctions
is
still
an
option
i
mean
the
serbians
make
it
clear
that
at
least
the
leadership
is
surviving
just
fine
and
they
feel
like
they
can
wait
you
out
and
even
the
administration
officials
we
had
in
the
other
day
said
theres
no
evidence
that
theyre
going
to
have
an
effect
any
time
soon
the
bosnian
serbs
have
said
no
to
the
peace
plan
when
does
no
mean
no
and
you
have
to
do
something
different
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
we
are
doing
something
different
were
moving
forward
on
further
sanctions
through
the
un
and
those
discussions
will
continue
were
going
to
continue
to
try
and
tighten
the
noose
on
serbia
and
i
think
that
every
opportunity
we
have
to
do
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
q
are
we
looking
again
at
lifting
the
arms
embargo
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
said
that
this
is
something
that
is
under
consideration
q
george
do
you
have
any
more
on
hugh
rodhams
condition
how
hes
doing
mr
stephanopoulos
as
far
as
i
know
nothings
changed
q
george
week
after
mr
mubarak
mr
stephanopoulos
its
a
little
unclear
i
think
well
be
able
to
get
you
more
either
tonight
or
tomorrow
morning
after
the
mubarak
visit
q
is
he
going
somewhere
for
easter
mr
stephanopoulos
not
that
i
know
of
q
what
more
can
you
tell
us
about
the
additional
aid
to
russia
that
the
president
plans
to
ask
congress
about
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
going
to
be
consulting
with
the
congress
and
with
our
partners
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
i
know
that
he
spoke
last
evening
with
congressman
gephardt
and
their
delegation
before
the
the
congressional
delegation
meets
with
the
russians
this
week
and
those
consultations
will
continue
over
the
next
several
weeks
q
do
you
expect
that
package
to
be
of
the
magnitude
of
the
one
announced
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
going
to
discuss
the
magnitude
q
how
about
the
list
of
cold
war
restrictions
where
do
you
stand
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
as
the
president
said
yesterday
hes
going
to
be
looking
for
that
list
from
the
congress
this
week
and
reviewing
it
he
believes
hes
going
to
try
and
get
it
this
week
and
hes
going
to
review
the
list
and
were
going
to
take
a
hard
look
at
it
q
but
theyre
making
it
up
i
mean
its
no
white
house
involvement
congress
is
compiling
this
list
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
hes
going
to
talk
to
the
congressional
leaders
about
compiling
the
list
but
im
certain
well
be
able
to
get
our
own
researchers
working
as
well
q
george
isnt
lifting
the
arms
embargo
more
of
a
probability
than
a
possibility
mr
stephanopoulos
its
something
thats
under
discussion
q
secretary
christopher
has
said
that
its
a
matter
of
time
and
for
months
before
that
happens
mr
stephanopoulos
again
all
i
can
say
is
that
its
something
that
the
president
is
reviewing
right
now
were
working
with
our
allies
in
the
un
on
a
sanctions
resolution
and
well
continue
to
review
other
matters
q
george
can
you
tell
us
anything
about
the
schedule
this
week
any
travel
mr
stephanopoulos
they
just
asked
about
that
i
dont
have
anything
more
beyond
tomorrows
visit
with
mubarak
right
now
q
are
there
consultations
george
with
any
jewish
american
organizations
concerning
jacksonvanick
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
national
conference
of
soviet
jewry
has
a
list
of
i
believe
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
national
conference
of
soviet

has
a
list
of
i
believe
refuseniks
well
certainly
take
a
look

q
mr
president
what
do
you
think
of
jesse
jacksons
protest
today
the
president
i
think
its
an
informational
protest
i
think
its
fine
the
owners
put
out
a
statement
few
days
ago
which
they
say
was
the
first
step
in
you
know
efforts
to
increase
minority
ownership
and
minority
increases
in
management
i
think
we
should
im
encouraged
by
don
baylors
appointment
out
in
colorado
and
i
think
its
time
to
make
a
move
on
that
front
so
i
think
its
a
legitimate
issue
and
i
think
its
like
i
said
its
an
informational
picket
and
not
an
attempt
to
get
people
not
to
go
to
the
game
so
i
think
its
good
q
do
you
think
theyre
moving
fast
enough
the
president
well
i
think
that
it
was
a
good
first
step
and
i
think
youll
see
some
movement
now
and
i
think
its
an
issue
that
deserves
some
attention
and
theyre
obviously
going
to
give
it
some
and
i
think
that
reverend
jackson
being
out
there
will
highlight
the
issue
so
i
think
its
fine
q
mr
president
how
about
the
logjam
in
the
senate
on
the
economic
stimulus
plan
do
you
think
theyll
be
able
to
break
that
and
get
cloture
the
president
i
dont
know
were
working
at
it
i
mean
its
a
classic
there
was
an
article
in
the
paper
today
one
of
the
papers
i
saw
which
pretty
well
summed
it
up
they
said
you
know
this
is
a
its
just
a
political
power
play
in
the
senate
the
majority
does
not
rule
its
not
like
the
country
its
not
like
the
its
not
like
the
house
if
the
minority
chooses
they
can
stop
majority
rule
and
thats
what
theyre
doing
there
are
a
lot
of
republican
senators
who
have
told
people
that
they
might
vote
for
the
stimulus
program
but
theres
enormous
partisan
political
pressure
not
to
do
it
and
of
course
what
it
means
is
that
in
this
time
when
no
new
jobs
are
being
created
even
though
there
seems
to
be
an
economic
recovery
it
means
that
for
political
purposes
theyre
willing
to
deny
jobs
to
places
like
baltimore
and
dallas
and
houston
and
pittsburgh
and
philadelphia
and
portland
and
seattle
its
very
sad
i
mean
the
block
grant
program
was
designed
to
create
jobs
in
a
hurry
based
on
local
priorities
and
its
one
that
the
republicans
had
always
championed
just
about
the
only
democrat
champions
of
the
program
were
people
like
me
who
were
out
there
at
the
grassroots
level
governors
and
senators
i
just
think
its
real
sad
that
they
have
chosen
to
exert
the
minority
muscle
in
a
way
that
will
keep
americans
out
of
work
i
think
its
a
mistake

are

high

sort

misses

doesnt

it

whichever

clayton
says
you
are
incorrect
the
most
recent
survey
data
i
can
find
shows
that
of
molestation
is
exclusively
homosexuals
is
bisexual
victims
are
both
male
and
female
and
the
remainder
is
exclusively
heterosexual
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
of
the
child
molestations
are
committed
by
heterosexuals
i
cannot
see
the
correlation
you
cite
bisexuals
are
heterosexuals
since
when
which
concludes
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
molest
children
or
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
have
the
propensity
for
molesting
children
i
havent
said
that
homosexual
child
molester
simply
that
is
more
likely
if
of
the
molestations
are
by
homosexuals
why
are
you
so
concerned
about
creating
a
relation
between
the
two
if
you
had
evidence
that
of
the
molestations
are
committed
by
homosexuals
you
might
find
a
relationship
ok
where
is
the
realtionship
you
make
the
one
that
is
shown
when
nambla
marches
in

also
what
is
the
reason
people
molest
from
human
sexuality
and
a

class
or
too
i
have
taken
the
overwhelming
voice
says
that
people
commit
these
acts
as
power
trips
and
to
feel
in
control
this
has
nothing
to
do

you

about

roe

allowed

to
adopt
very
very
broad
prohibitions
on
thirdtrimester
abortions
but
some
states
such
as
california
declined
to
do
so
it
was
reported
that
what
finally
stopped
third
trimester
elective
abortions
in
the
bay
area
wasnt
law
but
that
the
only
hospital
doing
them
ran
out
of
nurses

doctors
willing

do
them
not
surprisingly

was

about
this
i
remain

when
prochoicers
compare
abortion
in

clinic
to
a

ritual
in

you
have
to
start
wondering
a

my

if

i

since
there

in

conflicting

i
was
merely
suggesting
a
paradigm
that
might
make
sense
for
a

and
i
was
pointing
out
that
legal
precedent
defines
a

as
referring

to
the

so
your
suggestion
was
incorrect
if
at

an

the

clearly
have
the

any

have

no

can
be

resources
toward
their

even
if
necessary

save
the

life
there
is
a
confusion
here
between
action
and
inaction
a
parent
does
not
have
to
run
out
in

of
a
bus
to
save
their
childs
life
either
but
a
parent
is
required
to

there
is
a

here
about

blood

it

who
was
most
vocal

it
makes
me
proud

both

sounds

thats
the

of
the
stereotypical
rednecked
conservative
always

commies
always
will
be
ok
i
should
have
said
former
enemy
i
was
being
sarcastic
about
what
interventionists
want
to
do
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forcing
others
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
have
you
considered
a
noninterventionist
policy
if
market
reform
does
happen
russia
will
certainly
get
private
capital
at
private
risk
to
help
their
economy
they
will
even
have
incentive
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
government
will
probably
consider
them
enemies
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
then
theirs
the
ideological
point
we
want
to
win
russia
over
to
our
type
of
government
a
type
where
the
rulers
can
rule
without
limit
over
everyones
finances
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
cannot
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
cannot
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
if
a
billion
gift
was
that
important
to
our
well
being
couldnt
it
be
raised
voluntarilly
people
already
give
over
billion
a
year
to
charity
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someone
else
will
champion
welfare
or
education
or
doing
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
why
we
have
a
republic
and
not
a
true
democracy
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massive
scale
we
only
have
gridlock
on
a
congressional
scale
it
seems
instead
of
gridlock
on
any
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expensive
space
programs
national
charity
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probably
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limited
government
is
more
key
than
how
democratic
it
is
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
that
was
an
opinion
and
libertarians
are
very
big
on
free
speech
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
then
you
should
be
very
libertarian
consider
it
a
compromise
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaiders
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppose
werent
using
the
same
government
machine
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
causes
you
dont
support
we
could
do
that
years
ago
but
not
now
people
have
been
saying
that
for
hundreds
of
years
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
making
all
the
more
reason
to
depend

the

i
just

of

that

so
we
ought

make
beating
up

more
illegal
than
beating
up
a
straight
and
whos
advocating
that
hate
crimes
laws
are
aimed
at
the
motivations
of
the
acts
just
like
premeditated
homicide
is
treated
stricter
than
heatofpassion
homicide
but
you
still
get
into
trouble
for
example
how
often
are
crimes
of
violence
not
hate
crimes
the
question
is
then
who
are
you
hating
if
its
another
gang
member
then
its
better
than
if
the
person
you
hate
is
of
a
differnt
color
also
is
it
realistic
to
declare
that
crimes
of
hate
are
worse
than
crimes
of
gross
negligence
like
random
drive
by
shootings
where
they
cant
be
hate
crimes
because
the
shooter
doesnt
know
who
he
is
going
to
hit
he
just
shoots
into
the
crowd
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
was
with
the
current
mutation
of
the
us
constitution
under
the
current
police
state
someone
may
be
charged
multiple
times
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
single
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charge
so
if
i
set
off
a
bomb
in
the
world
trade
center
i
can
only
be
charged
with
more
than
one
murder
and
not
the
other
five
deaths
and
extensive
property
damage
after
all
the
bomb
was
a
single
act
first
i
heard
today
that
there
is
a
good
chance
that
the
us
instead
of
new
york
is
going
after
the
bombers
this
means
no
capital
punishment
secondly
double
jepardy
does
help
keep
the
government
from
going
after
you
for
first
one
murder
then
the
next
etc
a
sovereign
has
essentially
one
chance
with
a
single
fact
pattern
such
as
the
world
trade
center
bombing
that
is
why
the
bombers
will
in
all
probability
be
tried
for
all
the
deaths
as
well
as
the
property
damages
as
well
as
conspiracy
at

we

my
opinion
on

when
there
are
more

up

it
than
blacks
ie
when
hell
freezes
over
why
dont
you
compare
the
rates
at
which
blacks
and
whites
commit

blacks
commit
crimes
disproportionately
so
in
a
perfectly
fair
penal
system
blacks
would
be
disproportionately
represented
note
black
vs
white
crime
rates
is
not
a
racial
thing
its
probably
an
economic
thing
poor
people
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
and
blacks
are
more
likely
to
be
poor
the
way
to
reduce

sure
my
concern
is
the
well
being
of
the
children
if
you
are
willing
to
ignore
the
children
or
heap
abuse
insult
and
sacrilege
on
the
children
inside
the
davidian
house
then
god
rebuke
you
best
you
learn
directly
from
the
lord
the
corruption
youre
committing
in
gods
good
time
and
way
the
lord
judge
you
i
can
not
for
truth
be
told
i
would
send
you
all
straight
to
hell
and
god
would
be
right
in
sending
me
right
along
with
you
oh
fuck
you
and
the
god
you
rode
in
on
stephen
if
you
can
show
the
legitimacy
of
gods
claim
of
sovereignty
over
man
please
do
so
otherwise
stop
ranting
and
raving
about
him
already

interesting
that
you
would
respond
emotionally
in
defense
of
the
government
maybe
there
is
a
beating
heart
there
for
the
record
though
the
biggestbaddest
goverment
on
earth
claims
the
most
sovereignty
over
man
best
i
can
tell
god
allows
anyone
to
go
to
hell
who
wants
to
omnipotency
logically
determines
that
allowing
and
sending
mean
the
same
thing
mere
human
concepts
of
course
so
come
on
wds
why
bother
to
try
some
flimsy
facade
of
logic
waco
proves
its
not
needed
the
demonstration
that
government
can
walk
over
its
own
rules
in
the
name
of
justice
has
been
made
no
problem
by
me
noted
and
announced
for
the
record
just
giving
the
govern
ment
its
due
and
getting
back
to
more
worthwhile
nongovernment
concerns

am
pst
folks
were
about
to
start
the
background
briefing
on
the
aid
package
senior
administration
official
good
morning
the
president
president
clinton
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
yesterday
on
a
series
of
american
initiatives
to
support
economic
and
political
reform
in
russia
and
its
valued
at
billion
before
taking
your
questions
and
running
through
the
basic
outlines
of
this
package
i
want
to
make
a
few
points
first
this
is
the
maximum
that
the
clinton
administration
can
do
with
available
funds
to
support
russian
reform
all
of
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
there
is
no
need
for
the
administration
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
fund
any
of
these
programs
all
our
fiscal
year
funds
currently
are
available
so
in
effect
all
of
these
programs
can
begin
tomorrow
the
second
point
is
that
this
package
is
designed
to
support
russian
reformers
all
of
the
initiatives
in
the
package
are
directed
at
reformers
and
for
their
benefit
and
all
have
been
worked
out
with
prior
consultation
with
the
russian
government
third
the
president
is
determined
that
we
will
deliver
on
these
commitments
this
year
the
package
is
designed
to
maximize
our
ability
to
support
reform
in
designing
it
we
wanted
to
avoid
making
commitments
that
we
could
not
meet
and
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
can
meet
all
of
these
commitments
in
front
of
you
fourth
id
like
to
note
the
special
importance
of
trade
and
investment
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
russias
capital
and
technology
needs
throughout
the
next
decade
extend
well
into
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
no
collection
of
governments
can
meet
those
needs
only
the
private
sector
can
do
so
and
so
the
president
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
to
make
trade
and
investment
a
major
priority
in
the
relationship
they
also
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
new
joint
commission
on
energy
and
space
formed
headed
on
the
us
side
by
vice
president
gore
on
the
russian
side
by
prime
minister
chernomyrdin
and
the
goal
of
this
effort
is
to
break
through
the
barriers
to
trade
and
investment
on
both
sides
and
to
promote
a
vastly
expanded
relationship
if
it
would
be
helpful
id
be
prepared
to
run
down
the
first
page
which
is
a
summary
of
us
assistance
and
just
give
you
some
general
background
on
what
these
programs
are
ill
do
it
quickly
and
then
ill
be
glad
to
take
questions
the
first
group
of
initiatives
are
humanitarian
food
and
medical
assistance
this
is
part
of
our
effort
which
has
been
underway
for
several
years
to
provide
basic
humanitarian
grant
food
assistance
so
that
the
russian
government
can
assure
theres
at
least
a
minimal
amount
of
bread
on
the
shelves
in
the
major
cities
thats
million
in
grant
that
is
from
food
for
progress
the
grant
portion
of
food
for
progress
well
also
be
continuing
our
grant
assistance
in
medicines
and
pharmaceutical
supplies
and
thats
million
the
second
item
is
concessional
food
sales
as
you
know
the
united
states
has
had
a
longterm
grain
relationship
with
russia
its
important
to
us
and
its
important
to
russia
that
we
continue
that
relationship
the
president
has
chosen
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
concessional
loan
program
the
value
over
the
next
seven
months
is
million
these
are
concessional
terms
the
exact
terms
have
not
been
worked
out
but
i
think
its
fair
to
say
there
will
be
a
grace
period
on
principal
of
six
or
seven
years
and
concessional
rates
thereafter
for
the
life
of
the
deal
the
third
program
is
a
collection
of
private
sector
support
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
were
going
to
do
privatization
and
the
creation
of
small
businesses
is
the
number
one
priority
of
the
reform
government
in
moscow
and
so
the
president
has
decided
to
create
a
russianamerican
enterprise
fund
capitalized
this
year
at
million
and
the
goal
of
this
fund
is
to
make
direct
loans
to
small
businesses
in
russia
to
take
equity
positions
in
those
businesses
the
president
has
also
decided
to
create
a
privatization
fund
which
would
work
directly
with
the
russian
government
in
its
priority
objective
of
trying
to
convert
state
enterprises
from
a
stateowned
basis
to
a
private
basis
he
has
also
agreed
the
president
has
also
agreed
to
establish
a
eurasia
foundation
this
would
be
a
private
foundation
led
by
prominent
americans
to
fund
democratization
projects
in
russia
the
fourth
grouping
you
see
there
in
the
summary
page
is
democratization
itself
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
this
administration
has
given
a
new
impetus
to
the
goal
of
pursuing
democratization
in
russia
you
see
that
we
have
a
total
of
million
in
programs
various
programs
the
detailed
tables
give
an
indication
of
some
of
the
programs
that
were
launching
the
president
is
also
calling
for
the
development
of
a
democracy
corps
which
will
be
an
overarching
umbrella
group
to
try
to
incorporate
all
of
the
disparate
private
and
public
efforts
now
underway
from
the
united
states
to
support
reform
in
russia
the
fifth
program
you
see
is
russian
office
of
resettlement
this
is
a
new
initiative
created
and
conceptualized
by
this
administration
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
wed
like
to
do
is
work
with
the
russian
military
to
help
resettle
russian
officers
returning
from
the
baltic
states
and
other
parts
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
work
out
the
best
way
to
do
that
whether
its
with
russian
labor
and
russian
materials
or
using
prefab
american
construction
and
so
weve
decided
to
fund
on
a
demonstration
basis
the
construction
of
housing
units
well
be
working
very
closely
with
the
russian
military
on
this
and
i
would
say
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
this
project
the
sixth
area
is
energy
in
the
environment
they
are
two
issues
that
the
president
feels
strongly
about
our
initial
efforts
will
be
feasibility
studies
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
enhancing
their
energy
production
both
oil
and
gas
and
equally
important
trying
to
cut
down
on
the
leakages
in
the
oil
and
gas
pipeline
systems
which
cause
so
much
environmental
damage
ive
talked
a
little
bit
about
trade
and
investment
about
the
new
group
being
created
that
the
vice
president
will
chair
on
our
side
secretary
ron
brown
will
also
be
cochairing
with
deputy
prime
minister
shohkin
a
business
development
committee
which
will
work
in
all
other
sectors
of
the
economy
to
break
down
the
many
barriers
that
currently
exist
and
impede
trade
and
investment
we
are
also
going
to
appoint
a
fulltime
investment
ombudsman
in
the
american
government
to
work
on
this
problem
fulltime
and
the
point
id
like
to
make
here
is
trade
and
investment
in
the
is
every
bit
as
important
to
draw
an
analogy
as
arms
reductions
was
in
the
and
and
we
just
thought
that
in
looking
at
this
we
needed
to
make
a
commitment
within
our
own
government
to
have
people
work
on
it
senior
people
on
a
fulltime
basis
because
it
is
terribly
important
youll
notice
that
the
united
states
is
going
to
support
russias
membership
in
the
gatt
russia
has
had
observer
status
russia
has
requested
our
support
and
in
fact
requested
our
advice
in
becoming
a
member
of
the
gatt
we
think
that
the
longterm
goal
of
drawing
russia
into
the
global
economy
is
paramount
a
very
important
goal
and
that
is
why
we
are
supporting
the
membership
in
the
gatt
we
are
also
supporting
their
access
to
gsp
the
generalized
system
of
preferences
youll
note
that
exim
has
extended
million
in
credit
for
a
caterpillar
deal
in
siberia
that
opic
has
extended
million
in
credits
and
loan
guarantees
for
a
conoco
oil
project
id
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
very
close
to
an
agreement
between
russia
and
the
united
states
for
a
framework
facility
through
the
exim
bank
that
would
finance
russian
purchases
of
american
oil
and
gas
equipment
and
services
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
development
we
think
well
get
there
by
april
which
is
the
opening
day
of
the
tokyo
conference
the
conference
before
i
take
any
further
questions
id
like
to
defer
to
my
colleague
who
will
review
the
security
assistance
objectives
with
you
senior
administration
official
our
major
unfinished
agenda
with
the
russians
and
with
their
counterparts
in
ukraine
kazakhstan
and
belarus
is
in
the
area
of
the
safe
and
secure
dismantlement
of
the
nuclear
arsenals
on
their
territory
under
the
terms
of
the
start
i
and
start
ii
agreements
recently
we
completed
in
moscow
three
i
think
very
important
agreements
that
devote
a
significant
chunk
of
nunnlugar
funding
to
three
important
programs
the
first
is
the
program
of
million
for
the
strategic
nuclear
delivery
vehicle
dismantlement
program
that
is
for
submarines
for
icbm
dismantlement
and
for
bomber
dismantlement
million
the
second
is
a
million
tranche
of
funding
for
the
construction
of
a
facility
to
store
nuclear
materials
removed
from
the
warheads
as
they
are
dismantled
this
will
essentially
contribute
to
the
overall
design
and
the
early
phases
of
the
construction
of
that
storage
facility
and
finally
a
tranche
of
money
to
help
in
the
establishment
of
a
monitoring
system
for
the
nuclear
materials
as
they
are
withdrawn
from
the
weapons
system
so
we
add
that
total
to
the
extant
nunnlugar
assistance
which
has
been
flowing
about
million
for
some
overall
safety
improvements
for
various
kinds
of
equipment
and
safety
measures
that
we
have
been
working
out
with
the
russians
over
the
last
couple
of
years
so
this
is
an
area
where
we
will
be
going
a
lot
more
work
with
not
only
the
russians
but
with
the
ukrainians
kazhaks
and
belarussians
belarus
for
example
has
just
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
received
up
to
million
in
funds
for
safety
security
and
dismantlement
programs
on
belarussian
territory
and
this
was
in
the
wake
of
their
ratification
of
start
i
an
agreement
to
accede
to
npt
so
we
are
working
very
hard
with
all
the
parties
to
the
lisbon
protocols
and
will
continue
to
work
very
hard
with
them
and
i
look
upon
these
three
recent
agreements
with
russia
as
a
very
important
step
in
that
process
q
the
opic
funds
to
is
that
for
the
field
in
kazhakstan
and
conoco
already
signed
this
deal
with
kazhakstan
why
do
you
feel
now
it
is
necessary
if
its
the
same
one
why
do
you
feel
its
necessary
senior
administration
official
its
not
the
same
deal
chevron
signed
a
deal
with
kazhakstan
the
tenges
oil
field
this
is
a
new
investment
project
its
a
polar
lights
oil
development
and
renovation
project
and
its
being
announced
today
so
its
completely
new
q
can
you
tell
us
more
about
whats
involved
senior
administration
official
yes
conoco
like
other
american
oil
companies
has
been
searching
for
ways
to
do
two
things
one
to
prospect
for
new
oil
in
siberia
west
siberia
and
two
to
try
to
get
into
the
business
of
renovating
oil
wells
and
renovating
pipelines
both
oil
and
gas
in
russia
the
objective
here
obviously
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
natural
resources
in
russia
increase
energy
production
which
will
in
turn
increase
hard
currency
revenues
which
is
what
russia
needs
so
we
think
this
deal
is
very
very
good
development
for
russia
the
russians
do
as
well
and
its
good
for
an
american
company
and
the
american
government
has
played
a
leading
role
in
pulling
this
together
through
the
credit
facility
in
opic
and
through
the
loan
guarantee
q
so
its
to
search
and
also
to
renovate
fields
that
are
already
there
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
on
that
point
should
other
american
companies
expect
to
get
administration
support
for
such
deals
or
should
they
now
go
to
the
exim
and
try
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
billion
senior
administration
official
well
as
you
know
exim
is
part
of
the
us
government
and
various
parts
of
the
us
government
have
been
pushing
including
the
state
department
and
the
white
house
for
this
deal
to
be
consummated
and
we
think
it
will
and
if
we
arrive
at
this
agreement
by
april
there
will
be
billion
in
financing
available
for
american
companies
to
sell
their
equipment
and
sell
their
services
q
that
should
take
up
all
of
the
rest
of
the
deals
and
their
wont
be
and
their
will
or
there
wont
be
support
for
opic
sort
of
deals
such
as
this
conoco
senior
administration
official
theres
a
tremendous
amount
of
interest
on
the
part
of
american
oil
and
gas
companies
to
invest
in
russia
we
think
that
the
exim
oil
and
gas
facility
the
facility
once
it
is
concluded
will
soak
up
a
lot
of
that
interest
but
i
think
the
interest
may
even
extend
beyond
that
and
if
so
the
government
will
respond
q
whats
the
current
year
budget
costs
of
that
agreement
should
it
go
forward
and
is
there
any
current
year
budget
costs
senior
administration
official
ill
have
to
refer
you
to
exim
for
that
i
dont
know
the
details
of
that
q
the
concessional
food
sales
is
there
any
current
year
costs
to
that
or
is
it
delayed
until
the
years
in
which
the
payments
are
due
senior
administration
official
the
concessional
food
sales
are
from
food
for
progress
which
is
a
usda
program
usda
has
the
funds
we
dont
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
expend
those
funds
there
will
be
a
hit
in
the
budget
id
refer
you
to
usda
and
omb
for
the
details
on
that
q
can
you
talk
about
the
democracy
corps
q
and
the
private
sector
how
many
folks
are
going
to
be
involved
in
that
senior
administration
official
why
dont
i
start
with
the
democracy
corps
first
i
think
the
administration
felt
coming
into
office
that
there
were
literally
thousands
of
organization
private
organizations
in
the
united
states
that
in
one
way
or
another
were
working
at
the
goal
of
trying
to
achieve
democratization
in
russia
helping
on
a
farmertofarmer
basis
and
there
were
literally
or
us
government
agencies
that
had
a
variety
of
programs
in
this
area
and
so
the
administration
felt
the
president
felt
it
was
important
to
try
to
draw
all
of
these
initiatives
together
under
one
group
to
give
some
coherence
to
the
efforts
and
to
give
some
impetus
to
the
efforts
and
so
this
is
a
presidential
initiative
it
will
be
headed
by
ambassador
tom
simons
who
will
soon
take
up
his
duties
as
the
coordinator
for
us
assistance
in
the
former
soviet
union
and
were
very
hopeful
that
we
might
use
this
democracy
corps
not
only
to
draw
upon
the
resources
of
our
own
government
but
the
resources
of
the
american
private
sector
and
schools
and
communities
across
the
nation
q
any
kind
of
commitment
yet
any
kind
of
word
yet
on
and
any
new
money
that
needs
to
be
appropriated
besides
the
million
the
president
talked
about
senior
administration
official
the
administration
is
requesting
additional
funds
in
of
million
what
the
president
has
done
this
weekend
is
to
consult
really
intensively
yesterday
with
president
yeltsin
about
additional
measures
the
united
states
could
take
in
some
of
these
areas
to
support
reform
hell
be
consulting
with
the
congress
when
he
returns
to
washington
hell
be
consulting
also
with
the
other
ally
governments
and
well
make
a
decision
at
that
time
q
two
questions
about
the
billion
agricultural
money
first
of
all
i
thought
it
was
the
sort
of
consensus
that
what
russia
did
not
need
was
more
loans
for
food
so
why
did
you
decide
to
do
it
that
way
secondly
could
you
explain
agriculture
has
been
stopped
from
making
further
loans
for
food
because
of
russias
inability
to
pay
how
does
this
fit
into
that
situation
senior
administration
official
as
you
know
the
united
states
for
a
long
time
has
been
a
major
supplier
of
grains
and
food
commodities
agricultural
products
to
russia
i
think
between
and
we
had
extended
a
little
bit
of
history
here
about
billion
in
credits
credit
guarantees
through
the
commodity
credit
corporation
that
was
the
principal
vehicle
to
ensure
the
sale
of
american
grain
products
on
december
of
last
year
the
russian
government
stopped
its
payments
on
that
program
they
are
now
in
arrears
to
us
on
that
program
and
therefore
by
law
the
united
states
cannot
continue
that
program
and
so
the
president
working
with
secretary
espy
and
other
officials
in
the
cabinet
looked
for
other
ways
that
we
could
promote
american
grain
sales
and
i
think
we
have
two
ways
to
do
that
weve
announced
today
million
in
grant
food
assistance
through
the
food
for
progress
program
but
we
do
not
have
sufficient
authority
to
spend
million
in
grant
food
and
so
we
looked
for
a
concessional
loan
program
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
russia
that
a
shortterm
loan
program
for
russia
would
not
make
sense
now
but
a
longterm
concessional
loan
program
would
and
that
is
what
this
program
is
it
will
provide
once
the
final
details
are
worked
out
for
a
six
to
sevenyear
grace
period
on
payments
of
principal
and
then
from
years
seven
through
which
is
the
life
of
the
deal
it
will
provide
for
concessional
rates
of
interest
generally
around
three
to
four
percent
and
so
we
believe
and
the
russian
government
believes
this
is
a
good
deal
for
them
because
it
will
avoid
the
imperative
of
early
payments
and
put
them
into
the
out
years
but
it
will
also
continue
this
very
important
grain
relationship
which
is
important
for
them
and
its
important
for
the
american
farm
community
q
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
this
could
make
it
explicit
the
russians
failure
to
pay
the
interest
on
ecc
loan
does
not
in
any
way
affect
this
kind
of
loan
going
through
is
that
right
senior
administration
official
let
me
be
explicit
about
that
we
are
prevented
under
the
law
to
from
continuing
the
commodity
credit
corporation
shortterm
credit
program
because
of
russias
arrearages
to
the
united
states
all
of
you
know
about
those
arrearages
they
total
about
i
think
around
million
usda
can
give
you
an
exact
figure
so
having
taken
that
into
consideration
and
wanting
to
preserve
american
market
share
and
a
longterm
grain
relationship
wanting
to
respond
to
a
specific
request
from
the
russian
government
for
major
food
assistance
knowing
that
we
couldnt
take
it
from
the
grant
programs
because
we
dont
have
sufficient
authority
there
we
looked
at
food
for
progress
which
is
a
program
weve
used
to
great
effect
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
we
consulted
with
the
russian
government
and
arrived
at
this
solution
i
think
the
russians
are
pleased
because
it
provides
them
with
the
food
but
also
gives
them
a
little
bit
of
relief
on
the
shortterm
payments
q
where
do
those
funds
actually
come
from
senior
administration
official
they
come
from
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
program
under
usdas
authority
usda
has
the
authority
to
spend
these
funds
we
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
for
these
funds
and
i
want
to
make
that
general
point
again
everything
in
this
package
the
billion
package
comprises
funds
that
have
already
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
the
administration
can
begin
to
spend
these
monies
tomorrow
and
its
very
important
in
our
eyes
that
we
expend
all
the
funds
this
year
that
we
meet
these
commitments
and
we
are
confident
well
be
able
to
do
so
q
how
did
you
arrive
at
the
figure
of
million
does
that
max
out
that
program
or
did
you
actually
have
a
range
from
to
senior
administration
official
theres
a
reason
for
it
the
reason
was
that
the
russian
government
told
us
thats
about
the
amount
of
grain
that
they
needed
between
now
and
harvest
time
and
so
the
idea
is
that
we
would
begin
the
shipments
probably
million
per
month
from
now
until
the
harvest
in
the
autumn
at
which
time
russia
wont
require
the
same
level
of
food
imports
from
the
west
q
i
would
imagine
theres
going
to
be
some
considerable
envy
and
jealousy
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
other
republics
because
of
the
size
and
the
scope
of
this
with
russia
have
you
given
any
consideration
to
advancing
negotiations
for
the
same
kinds
of
projects
with
the
ukraine
with
georgia
with
some
of
the
other
republics
senior
administration
official
yes
were
very
conscience
of
the
fact
that
we
also
have
an
interest
in
extending
american
support
to
the
other
countries
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
have
told
ourselves
and
we
have
planned
that
in
the
area
of
technical
assistance
the
grant
technical
assistance
that
you
see
roughly
percent
of
the
funding
will
go
to
russia
and
roughly
percent
to
the
other
countries
in
the
area
of
food
sales
we
have
been
active
with
ukraine
in
grant
food
assistance
with
georgia
and
armenia
we
will
continue
that
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
after
this
summit
we
will
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
our
programs
with
the
other
countries
to
ensure
that
they
are
adequate
and
they
are
productive
and
theyre
hardhitting
q
has
anything
happened
at
the
summit
to
lead
american
energy
companies
and
other
companies
to
believe
that
russia
is
going
to
be
more
userfriendly
toward
them
in
terms
of
taxing
legalities
bureaucracy
senior
administration
official
well
one
of
our
primary
objectives
coming
into
this
summit
was
to
highlight
not
only
the
economic
agenda
but
also
trade
and
investment
and
id
like
to
refer
to
the
point
i
made
at
the
beginning
were
convinced
in
talking
about
this
problem
the
problem
of
how
to
support
russia
longterm
were
convinced
that
no
collection
of
western
governments
have
the
financial
resources
over
the
next
decade
to
fuel
the
continuation
of
reform
that
only
the
private
sector
can
do
that
we
look
at
our
own
society
and
we
see
tremendous
capability
in
resources
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
it
is
a
very
good
match
with
what
the
russians
need
now
which
is
financial
investment
in
the
existing
oil
and
gas
wells
and
pipeline
and
new
technology
and
new
capital
to
finance
new
production
thats
what
the
russian
government
has
told
us
it
wants
to
do
and
so
thats
why
we
have
made
such
a
major
emphasis
on
it
thats
why
trade
and
investment
was
a
prominent
issue
on
the
first
day
of
these
talks
and
in
fact
figured
prominently
last
night
in
the
meeting
between
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
and
were
hoping
that
together
we
might
send
a
strong
signal
to
the
american
business
community
that
we
support
their
efforts
to
invest
in
russia
that
the
united
states
through
ex
im
and
opec
and
the
department
of
commerce
will
be
there
to
support
them
q
my
question
is
is
yeltsin
in
any
position
to
deliver
on
making
russia
a
more
senior
administration
official
we
think
he
is
i
would
note
that
president
yeltsins
prime
minister
mr
chernomyrdin
worked
for
years
in
the
russian
oil
and
gas
sector
he
will
now
chair
a
highlevel
commission
with
the
vice
president
vice
president
gore
to
try
to
break
through
the
barriers
that
currently
exist
to
western
investment
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
we
believe
we
have
a
commitment
to
make
that
committee
an
important
committee
and
were
looking
forward
to
the
work
q
what
type
of
mechanism
is
already
in
place
to
administer
the
private
sector
portion
of
the
program
and
will
the
us
be
directly
involved
in
the
tail
end
of
distribution
of
the
actual
funds
or
is
the
money
simply
turned
over
to
the
russian
government
for
distribution
at
their
will
senior
administration
official
are
you
talking
about
the
variety
of
programs
listed
here
it
depends
on
the
program
itself
in
most
cases
though
we
are
either
working
through
american
pbos
or
american
government
agencies
to
ensure
that
the
money
obviously
is
well
spent
that
the
money
gets
to
the
intended
source
thats
an
obligation
we
have
to
the
congress
to
ensure
the
money
is
well
spent
and
that
we
can
account
for
the
money
we
have
done
that
in
the
last
couple
of
months
intensively
and
we
will
continue
to
do
it
for
each
of
these
programs
but
they
are
all
quite
different
for
instance
in
the
area
of
grant
food
and
medical
assistance
for
grant
food
it
is
carried
out
through
usda
and
usda
accounts
for
the
delivery
of
the
food
for
grant
medical
assistance
weve
been
working
through
project
hope
which
is
a
private
organization
for
the
housing
for
instance
the
resettlement
of
russian
officers
well
be
working
with
a
group
of
american
pbos
on
some
of
the
democratization
projects
were
working
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
and
private
foundations
were
working
with
journalists
in
russia
on
a
media
project
that
you
may
have
noticed
so
we
literally
have
here
to
different
activities
under
all
these
rubrics
and
theyre
all
going
to
be
carried
out
in
slightly
different
ways
some
directly
with
the
russian
government
some
with
russian
citizens
q
the
jacksonvanik
restrictions
that
remain
and
on
the
cocom
restrictions
that
remain
can
you
tell
us
what
the
president
has
to
do
on
that
senior
administration
official
well
as
george
noted
yesterday
president
yeltsin
raised
these
as
irritants
in
the
relationship
the
president
has
noted
that
i
think
its
fair
to
say
we
will
go
back
now
in
our
own
government
when
we
return
to
washington
and
look
at
both
of
these
questions
and
well
get
back
to
the
russian
government
q
you
were
not
prepared
for
these
questions
when
you
got
here
senior
administration
official
we
were
prepared
for
these
questions
weve
looked
at
them
but
were
not
prepared
to
make
a
quick
decision
this
weekend
they
require
let
me
just
explain
particularly
on
jacksonvanik
they
require
consultation
with
the
congress
they
require
consultation
with
the
american
jewish
community
and
were
very
sensitive
to
those
concerns
and
so
well
want
to
go
back
and
talk
to
them
before
we
take
any
action
q
is
this
package
designed
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
go
to
congress
for
anything
at
this
point
senior
administration
official
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
the
advantage
of
this
particular
package
is
that
all
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
so
the
administration
will
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
seek
any
additional
authority
to
fund
any
of
these
efforts
in
effect
they
can
all
begin
tomorrow
and
i
know
that
many
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
these
projects
will
begin
tomorrow
and
thats
the
advantage
of
this
particular
initiative
q
if
this
as
the
president
says
is
a
longterm
longhaul
thing
and
members
of
congress
are
at
this
moment
heading
for
moscow
why
arent
you
talking
about
going
to
congress
and
suggesting
to
the
president
of
russia
that
you
are
prepared
to
go
to
congress
for
various
things
senior
administration
official
i
think
weve
been
clear
about
that
the
president
is
discussing
this
weekend
with
president
yeltsin
some
additional
ideas
that
we
have
for
american
funding
of
additional
projects
and
ideas
that
he
has
we
have
a
major
congressional
delegation
that
left
last
night
headed
by
representative
gephardt
and
well
want
to
consult
with
that
delegation
and
other
members
of
congress
before
doing
anything
and
well
also
want
to
consult
with
our
allies
so
thats
where
it
stands
now
q
weve
been
told
repeatedly
that
a
number
of
these
items
represent
different
or
new
ways
of
spending
the
money
already
appropriated
could
you
just
tick
off
which
of
these
items
represents
reprogramming
or
at
least
spending
money
in
ways
that
it
was
not
previously
set
to
be
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
weve
said
that
these
are
all
projects
that
either
congress
had
allocated
money
for
through
the
freedom
support
act
there
were
some
funds
that
were
left
over
from
and
this
administration
took
office
and
had
some
new
ideas
about
how
the
funds
might
be
expended
we
didnt
use
just
the
freedom
support
act
funds
or
the
funds
we
went
into
some
of
the
agency
allocations
exim
opic
and
usda
and
tried
to
look
for
creative
ways
to
further
our
programs
and
example
of
that
is
the
food
for
progress
concessional
loans
we
had
hit
a
brick
wall
with
another
type
of
funding
through
usda
we
could
not
go
forward
legally
and
so
we
looked
for
a
more
creative
way
to
ensure
continued
american
market
share
and
ensure
continued
grain
sales
and
we
think
we
found
it
q
where
for
example
are
you
getting
the
money
for
this
russian
officer
resettlement
senior
administration
official
thats
from
the
freedom
support
act
funds
q
in
other
words
all
of
the
money
is
being
directly
spent
in
new
ways
so
to
speak
senior
administration
official
most
of
the
grant
projects
that
you
see
if
you
look
at
the
general
chart
the
second
chart
its
broken
down
into
grant
and
credits
and
if
you
look
under
grants
the
technical
cooperation
projects
that
total
million
that
is
almost
all
freedom
support
act
funding
a
little
bit
of
it
is
leftover
funds
from
fiscal
year
the
nunnlugar
funds
of
course
you
know
about
the
legislative
history
of
those
funds
q
cooperation
senior
administration
official
from
fy
i
dont
have
the
exact
figure
it
was
not
a
considerable
figure
q
could
you
tell
us
please
has
anything
happened
here
this
weekend
that
will
break
the
log
jam
between
ukraine
and
russia
over
start
for
start
i
and
ii
as
a
result
of
whats
happened
here
senior
administration
official
both
presidents
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
will
be
discussing
this
issue
this
morning
in
fact
we
havent
yet
gotten
to
security
and
arms
control
related
issues
that
will
be
this
mornings
session
i
know
that
president
clinton
will
be
very
strongly
reinforcing
that
this
is
a
top
priority
for
us
weve
been
talking
to
the
russians
and
the
ukrainians
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
about
ways
that
we
might
help
to
facilitate
the
discussions
between
them
up
to
this
point
this
has
been
a
very
important
negotiation
thats
been
going
on
essentially
between
moscow
and
kiev
and
we
are
at
the
point
now
of
essentially
discussing
with
them
if
there
are
ways
that
we
could
contribute
to
this
discussion
help
to
move
things
forward
essentially
but
in
terms
of
what
is
coming
out
of
this
weekend
i
dont
yet
know
in
a
couple
hours
well
know
q
just
a
followup
on
the
financing
here
is
any
of
this
robbing
peter
to
pay
boris
since
its
all
current
year
appropriations
have
you
taken
it
from
anyplace
thats
been
earmarked
and
put
it
into
this
fund
senior
administration
official
there
are
smoke
and
mirrors
here
and
i
think
its
an
important
point
to
note
we
could
have
given
you
a
page
of
assistance
numbers
that
included
outyear
funding
were
going
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
many
of
these
projects
for
instance
the
enterprise
funds
the
privatization
effort
the
housing
effort
and
weve
already
talked
to
the
russians
about
our
longterm
commitment
we
could
have
put
in
really
big
numbers
and
this
could
have
been
a
bigger
package
but
we
wanted
to
make
a
point
this
package
is
fy
its
funds
that
we
have
and
were
going
to
do
what
we
say
were
going
to
do
and
the
president
feels
very
strongly
about
that
in
the
past
there
is
a
legacy
that
the
western
governments
the
combination
of
governments
put
up
large
budget
figures
and
for
any
number
of
reasons
were
not
able
to
meet
them
were
determined
and
the
president
is
determined
to
carry
out
every
single
program
in
this
package
and
well
do
it
but
we
do
have
a
longerterm
commitment
and
thats
part
of
the
discussions
on
economics
this
weekend
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
on
what
it
is
we
can
do
to
most
effectively
support
reform
and
weve
told
them
that
we
do
have
a
commitment
on
some
of
these
programs
beyond
this
fiscal
year
q
taken
it
way
from
any
senior
administration
official
no
we
havent
okay
the
question
is
have
we
reprogrammed
any
of
these
funds
so
have
we
taken
it
from
other
countries
to
pay
for
programs
in
russia
the
answer
is
no
we
have
not
done
so
q
in
terms
of
funding
there
is
no
available
monies
left
and
you
simply
find
a
creative
way
to
find
money
somewhere
else
doesnt
that
in
fact
support
the
theory
senior
administration
official
not
at
all
i
dont
think
it
does
thats
a
particular
example
and
the
example
is
grain
sales
the
commodity
credit
corporation
credit
guarantee
program
was
shortterm
loans
that
russia
had
to
pay
back
within
to
months
you
all
know
about
russias
debt
problem
and
russia
was
unable
to
meet
those
commitments
so
we
looked
for
a
way
to
do
two
things
to
meet
russias
requirement
for
grain
theyre
a
net
grain
importer
on
a
massive
scale
and
also
meet
our
objective
of
making
sure
that
the
american
farmers
have
a
chance
to
sell
their
products
to
russia
and
we
simply
look
for
another
way
to
finance
that
and
we
have
legislative
authority
to
do
it
this
program
has
been
successful
in
other
areas
we
had
not
tried
it
before
in
the
former
soviet
union
but
we
thought
we
should
now
q
isnt
this
really
the
bushclinton
aid
package
for
russia
since
these
funds
were
really
first
derived
by
initiatives
put
forward
by
president
bush
senior
administration
official
no
i
dont
think
thats
a
fair
characterization
a
lot
of
these
funds
were
appropriated
by
the
us
congress
is
in
this
administration
took
office
and
inherited
some
obligations
that
the
bush
administration
had
made
but
we
had
a
long
six
to
seven
week
review
of
this
program
we
decided
to
meet
the
commitments
that
had
been
made
by
the
previous
administration
but
we
have
gone
well
beyond
them
in
funding
the
enterprise
fund
which
was
just
an
idea
but
the
idea
had
not
been
filled
out
with
a
program
there
was
no
number
attached
to
it
in
grouping
together
some
projects
and
trying
to
make
them
into
a
coherent
whole
in
the
privatization
effort
i
would
say
is
another
clinton
initiative
further
we
listened
to
the
russian
government
and
listened
to
the
russian
military
who
told
us
that
the
resettlement
of
their
officers
was
important
to
them
for
political
and
economic
and
social
reasons
and
president
clinton
has
responded
to
that
and
we
are
making
a
longterm
commitment
that
beyond
this
demonstration
project
were
going
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
much
more
in
trying
to
settle
those
officers
i
would
also
say
that
the
president
has
given
impetus
to
all
of
us
in
the
agencies
to
think
much
more
broadly
about
what
it
is
we
can
do
on
democratization
because
there
we
have
some
experience
and
some
comparative
advantage
that
lends
itself
to
the
russian
experience
and
in
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
which
is
another
new
initiative
were
hopeful
that
we
can
take
the
resources
of
the
private
sector
as
well
as
the
american
government
to
achieve
that
objective
so
i
would
not
characterize
it
that
way
at
all
and
as
most
of
you
know
i
am
a
career
civil
servant
i
was
in
the
last
administration
im
very
familiar
with
what
the
last
administration
did
and
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
clinton
assistance
package
for
russia
q
theres
been
a
lot
of
criticism
that
aid
in
the
past
has
not
gotten
to
the
people
is
there
anything
in
this
outside
of
the
ombudsman
that
will
guarantee
that
this
money
will
not
just
disappear
because
its
being
administered
by
the
russian
government
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
i
know
that
the
president
and
other
senior
officials
of
our
government
are
concerned
that
american
money
be
spent
wisely
and
that
it
get
to
the
source
that
its
intended
for
which
its
intended
and
so
were
going
to
take
great
care
aid
and
the
state
department
will
take
great
care
in
making
sure
that
the
funds
are
expended
properly
and
that
theyre
reaching
their
source
i
would
not
that
this
package
is
not
simply
a
package
of
support
solely
to
the
russian
government
some
of
these
projects
especially
in
democratization
and
exchanges
are
going
to
be
worked
out
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
with
businesses
the
private
enterprise
support
is
another
example
of
that
senior
administration
official
if
i
could
just
add
a
word
on
this
point
with
regard
to
the
ssdrelated
programs
one
area
that
weve
been
looking
at
very
very
closely
is
consideration
of
actually
using
russian
firms
in
subcontracting
for
these
kinds
of
programs
they
would
be
working
very
closely
of
course
with
the
american
firms
who
would
be
the
prime
contractors
but
this
is
a
fine
example
i
think
of
a
more
of
a
imaginative
and
flexible
approach
toward
getting
some
of
that
funding
down
to
the
grassroots
level
down
to
the
ground
in
russia
but
at
the
same
time
ensuring
that
it
is
spent
efficiently
and
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
q
when
would
the
democracy
corps
start
exactly
when
do
you
see
this
happening
how
would
get
it
off
the
ground
senior
administration
official
well
the
president
is
today
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
were
going
to
work
out
its
framework
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
ambassador
simons
takes
up
his
duties
on
may
but
in
effect
weve
already
started
because
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
the
administration
has
begun
to
reach
out
to
people
in
the
private
sector
who
have
come
to
us
asking
us
to
help
facilitate
their
activities
in
russia
and
weve
said
that
we
will
be
helpful
weve
also
tried
to
kind
of
coordinate
in
a
much
more
effective
way
the
activities
of
our
own
government
we
do
have
or
agencies
that
are
active
in
russia
in
one
way
or
another
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
draw
them
together
and
to
focus
their
efforts
q
excuse
me
how
much
of
this
billion
will
actually
be
spent
in
the
united
states
by
american
made
goods
senior
administration
official
i
dont
have
any
figures
for
you
now
but
perhaps
we
could
try
to
work
something
up
in
the
next
couple
of
days
on
that
q
this
figure
is
larger
than
the
figure
that
has
been
in
the
press
did
this
program
grow
yesterday
as
a
result
of
the
discussions
or
have
we
just
been
that
far
off
the
mark
senior
administration
official
no
i
think
unfortunately
the
press
has
been
a
little
bit
off
the
mark
and
im
sorry
to
say
that
no
this
package
president
clinton
put
us
to
work
about
seven
weeks
ago
on
this
package
and
he
was
briefed
intensively
on
this
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
intellectual
leadership
in
this
package
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
ideas
in
the
package
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
we
had
this
rough
package
worked
out
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
been
refining
it
ever
since
we
spent
a
couple
of
days
last
week
going
over
it
with
the
russian
government
both
the
embassy
in
washington
and
the
government
in
moscow
through
our
own
embassy
and
so
its
been
evolving
but
this
particular
package
has
been
together
for
about
two
weeks
q
where
is
yeltsins
input
into
this
then
there
was
so
much
talk
before
about
the
president
wanted
to
get
yeltsins
views
about
specifically
what
was
needed
and
so
forth
is
that
in
the
out
years
senior
administration
official
no
its
both
president
yeltsin
has
on
several
occasions
told
us
for
instance
that
support
for
the
creation
of
private
businesses
is
important
to
him
that
the
resettlement
of
russian
military
officers
is
important
and
that
first
and
foremost
the
effort
to
privatize
the
state
industries
is
important
to
them
and
so
what
we
did
was
to
try
to
make
those
the
centerpiece
of
our
technical
assistance
part
o
the
package
we
listened
to
him
on
the
privatization
effort
we
have
been
working
with
the
russian
government
for
months
on
this
trying
to
work
out
all
the
details
so
the
russian
government
on
most
of
these
programs
was
involved
every
step
of
the
way
but
let
me
get
at
the
other
part
of
your
question
the
president
is
also
using
this
weekend
to
talk
about
a
broader
set
of
initiatives
that
we
might
undertake
and
were
looking
for
his
ideas
the
president
has
brought
his
own
ideas
to
the
table
for
instance
on
energy
and
the
environment
and
in
housing
but
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
not
we
need
to
consult
with
the
congress
and
we
need
to
consult
with
the
other
allied
governments
that
are
also
active
q
theres
essentially
nothing
that
happened
in
the
last
day
and
a
half
that
measurably
altered
the
package
that
you
came
in
with
senior
administration
official
this
particular
package
as
i
said
was
worked
out
and
was
ready
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
since
then
consulted
with
the
russian
government
on
the
final
stages
of
its
development
and
so
this
weekend
weve
primarily
talked
about
future
about
what
more
the
united
states
and
other
western
countries
can
do
to
support
reform
in
russia
which
is
our
base
objective
here
q
i
noticed
that
you
that
money
appropriated
to
train
bankers
and
businessmen
and
officers
can
you
tell
me
what
about
job
training
for
workers
who
are
displaced
by
privatization
senior
administration
official
youre
right
we
have
a
program
to
train
russian
young
russians
in
banking
and
financial
services
in
the
united
states
part
of
the
housing
initiative
its
not
just
to
build
housing
units
its
to
retrain
russian
officers
who
are
retiring
into
other
professions
q
money
for
job
training
for
workers
whose
jobs
are
disappearing
because
of
privatization
senior
administration
official
we
have
not
yet
allocated
any
money
for
that
q
why
not
q
of
the
million
is
going
to
build
housing
units
isnt
that
a
lot
of
money
per
unit
given
what
the
western
dollar
will
buy
in
the
former
soviet
union
senior
administration
official
if
you
want
to
do
housing
the
right
way
its
not
just
the
building
the
framework
of
a
house
youve
got
to
think
about
all
the
utilities
youve
got
to
think
about
the
purchase
of
land
youve
got
to
think
about
sewage
and
gas
and
electricity
and
so
forth
and
its
also
retraining
its
not
enough
to
put
retired
an
officer
coming
out
of
riga
or
tallin
or
vilnius
in
a
house
in
western
russia
we
think
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
to
retrain
those
officers
as
well
this
is
responding
to
a
request
from
the
russian
government
q
of
the
million
will
go
to
retrain
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
are
you
talking
about
apartment
buildings
or
single
senior
administration
official
were
talking
about
single
individual
dwellings
q
youre
saying
that
only
families
will
be
served
by
this
senior
administration
official
what
i
want
to
i
thought
i
pointed
out
earlier
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
we
didnt
want
to
do
given
the
experience
that
the
germans
and
the
turks
and
the
italians
have
had
in
building
housing
in
western
russian
we
did
not
want
to
leap
into
it
with
a
huge
amount
of
money
what
we
want
to
do
is
work
over
the
next
couple
of
months
and
try
to
figure
out
with
american
organizations
in
the
private
sector
the
best
way
to
get
this
job
done
i
noted
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
that
and
so
i
would
expect
that
we
would
put
a
lot
more
money
into
this
in
the
future
but
we
want
to
do
it
wisely
we
want
to
spend
the
money
wisely
q
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
convinces
you
that
it
will
protect
russias
reforms
and
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position
to
may
back
the
money
theyre
supposed
to
pay
back
especially
considering
their
other
debt
problem
senior
administration
official
well
look
i
think
its
important
to
note
that
the
united
states
on
its
own
does
not
have
the
capability
to
fuel
a
continuation
of
russian
reform
its
got
to
be
a
collective
western
effort
and
were
looking
to
our
allies
to
do
more
as
well
but
beyond
that
its
really
what
the
russians
do
that
is
going
to
decide
the
fate
of
reform
we
can
simply
play
a
role
and
we
feel
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
so
which
is
consistent
with
our
national
interests
q
did
the
president
say
that
the
value
of
the
us
contribution
was
that
it
would
create
security
and
prosperity
for
the
united
states
so
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
does
this
senior
administration
official
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
fundamental
objective
of
our
policy
toward
russia
and
that
is
we
want
to
do
everything
we
can
to
support
the
continuation
of
reform
we
are
convinced
that
if
reformers
stay
in
power
then
well
be
able
to
continue
the
drawdown
of
nuclear
forces
foreign
policy
cooperation
and
economic
interaction
which
are
the
three
benefits
to
the
united
states
from
reform
in
russia
so
its
not
a
simple
question
you
cant
just
say
that
this
program
is
the
answer
its
a
longterm
question
and
we
have
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
it
q
and
then
on
the
question
of
russias
ability
to
repay
what
convinces
you
theyll
be
able
to
pay
seven
to
years
from
now
senior
administration
official
well
the
russian
government
has
made
a
commitment
to
repay
and
what
were
hoping
is
that
if
reform
continues
and
if
they
can
continue
to
improve
their
oil
and
gas
sector
and
earn
additional
hard
currency
revenues
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position
six
or
seven
years
from
now
to
pay
back
those
loans
q
substantial
governmenttogovernment
loan
weve
ever
gotten
into
with
the
russians
senior
administration
official
i
dont
want
to
answer
authoritatively
on
that
i
dont
go
back
or
years
on
this
but
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
yes
it
is
because
the
previous
way
that
we
financed
grain
exports
was
really
to
just
ensure
private
bank
loans
this
is
a
different
type
of
effort
q
government
loans
in
any
other
sector
that
you
recall
i
know
it
wasnt
done
in
senior
administration
official
i
think
its
fair
to
say
this
is
a
new
and
unique
effort

hike
of
reversed
the
trend
brett
is
this
true
some
more
details
would
be
appreciated
yes
sadly
this
is
true
the
primary
reason
and
the
essence
of
the
details
that
you
are
seeking
is
that
the
grahmrudman
budget
controls
were
working
in
fact
they
were
working
so
well
that
unless
the
feds
did
something
they
were
going
to
have
to
start
cutting
pork
so
bush
and
the
democrats
got
together
in
a
budget
summit
and
replaced
grahmrudman
with
the
now
historic
grand
compromise
in
which
bush
consented
to
raise
taxes
in
exchange
for
certain
caps
on
spending
increases
as
it
turned
out
the
taxes
killed
the
reagan
expansion
and
the
caps
on
spending
increases
were
dispelled
by
clinton
in
his
first
act
as
president
so
that
he
could
create
his
own
new
plan
with
more
tax
increases
the
result
is
that
clinton
now
hopes
to
reduce
the
deficit
to
a
level
above
where
it
was
when
reagan

dear

didnt
this
die
out
in

with
mccarthy

the

ive
spent
quite
a

in

and
let
me
tell
you
it
is
very
refreshing
to
spend

with
people
who
are
not
full
of
arrogant
nationalism
and
empty
patriotism
that
is
exactly
the
problem
with
canadians
they
dont
stand
for
anything
with
certitude
didnt
your

ever
teach
you
not
to
generalize
i
am
a
canadian
and
i
stand
up
for
too
many
things
with

much

the
canadians
i
know
well
enough
to
say
this
about
seem
to
have
a
great

of
pride
in
their
provinces
and
their

they
arent

by

like
many

are
could
this
be
because
they
are
bereft

i
would
like
to
go
on
record
as
objecting
to
mr
hentrich
calling
himself
an
aryan
the
word
aryan
is
of
sanskrit
origin
and
occurs
first
in
the
hindu
scripture
the
rigveda
it
seems
to
have
been
a
tribal
term
but
may
have
had
connotations
of
good
character
such
connotations
are
quite
explicit
in
the
sayings
of
the
buddha
who
called
his
religion
the
eightfold
aryan
path
the
word
was
borrowed
by
the
german
scholar
max
mueller
who
used
it
as
a
synonym
for
indoeuropean
but
then
the
nazis
proceeded
to
steal
it
and
started
pretending
that
aryan
is
synonymous
with
nordic
which
seems
highly
unlikely
the
people
who
originally
called
themselves
aryas
the
iranians
noprth
indians
the
afghans
and
possibly
the
kurds
are
none
of
them
nordic
so
the
use
of
the
word
by
westerners
though
meant
with
apparent
good
humor
in
this
case
is
nontheless
inappropriate
the
only
westerners
who
may
have
some
claim
to
call
themselves
aryans
by
descent
are
the
celts
who
seem
to
have
wor
shipped
a
god
called
aryaman
who
is
mentioned
in
the
rigveda
if
you
want
to
check
what
i
am
saying
look
at
mallorys
book
in
search
of
the
indoeuropeans
or
just
look
at
the
encyclopedia
britannica
the
reason
this
usage
is
offensive
is
that
most
of
ancient
indian
literature
as
well
as
religion
is
directly
or
inderectly
due
to
the
aryans
and
for
westerners
to
butt
in
is
really
not
nice
not
to
mention
the
horrible
things
done
by
germans
to
jews
using
a
word
to
which
the
germans
have
no
clear

no
it

last

first
yes
a

act
may
lead
to
multiple
independent
charges
however
as
a
side
note
i
think
that
the
prohibition
on
double

mandates
that
the
suspect
be
tried
on
all
those
charges
at
the

time
in

of

the

can
pull

crock
that
theyre

ie
trying
a
person
whos
already
been
acquitted
in

court
on

charges
arising
from
the
same
act
i
think
that
this
is
double
jeopardy
but
apparently
the
courts
dont
agree
with
me
note
that
the
laws
that
dont
agree
with
you
were
passed
to
protect
a
class
of
people
who
couldnt
get
justice
from
the
state

specifically
civil
rights
workers
in
missisippi
in
the
the
federal
protection
of

supersedes
the
nonfeasance

similar

traditional

i
beat

up
for

you
pays
your
money
and
you
takes
your
pick
me
i
lean
strongly
towards
the
against
argument
i
know
that
having
the
law
treat
everyone
as
equals
regardless
of
realities
will
not
in
and
of
itself
lead
to
true
equality
and
in
fact
may
lead
at
times
towards
greater
inequality
nonetheless
i
believe
that
true
equality
is
at
least
possible
when
the
laws
treat
people
as
being
equal
while
true
equality
is
by
definition
impossible
when
the
laws
themselves
mandate
unequal
treatment
of
classes
of
people
by
the

as
anatole
france
said
the
law
in
its
impartial
majesty
forbids
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
from
sleeping
under
bridges
equality
of
law
can
be
construed
in
any
number
of
ways
for
example
the
fact
that
all
property
thefts
regardless
of
value
are
not
punished
equally
is
an
inequality
which
protects
those
who
have
a
lot
of
money
from
having
it
stolen
you
could
easily
define
equality
to
regard
the
property
in
terms
of
its
significance
for
the
owner
this
would
a
form
of
equality
that
would
be
skewed
toward
poorer
people
in
fact
most
antigay
bashing
laws
are
constructed
to
offer
equal
protection
they
make
it
an
offense
to
damage
people
based
on
a
motivation
of
hatred
for
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
in
its
impartial
majesty
protects
hets
as
well
as

from

bashed

it
is

youll
have
to
define

yes
a

is
human
but
i
still
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
human

and
you
have
merely
begged
the
question
without
responding
by
trying
to
inject
the
notion
of

into
the

you
muddy
the
waters
without

whatever

is
a

person
a
human
being
you
still
have
not
answered
what
you
mean
by
human
being
please
do
so
i
would
suggest
that
legal
precedent
defines
a
human
being
ie
a
person
whose
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
as
someone
with
a
functioning
brain
could
you
cite
some
of
those
precedents
for
me
or
the
basis
of
this
definition
while
the
law
does
allow
the
removal
of
extraordinary
means
of
sustaining
life
in
cases
of
brain
death
this
in
itself
does
not
lead
to
your
conclusion
of
how
the
law
defines
a
human
being
however
at
least
you
defined
human
being
in
a
tenuous
fashion
that
is
a
person
whose
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
for
my
answer
to
your
question
i
refer
you
to
roe
v
wade
and
subsequent
supreme
court
decisions
which
define
to
what
extent
a
fetus
is
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
certain
judges
have
concurred
that
slavery
is
not
a
violation
of
human
rights
therefore
it
is
not
you
wont
answer
the
question
and
instead
drag
in
irrelevancies
if
you
want
a
definition
of
human
being
that
does
not
depend
on
the
vagaries
of
law
but
holds
solid
whatever
the
law
may
rule
provide
it
for
me
i
would
suggest
that
your
blind
faith
would
not
likely
hold
up
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot
the
brain
lifedeath
paradigm
is
one
that
i
suggest
as
one
consistent
with
other
legal
definitions
it
clearly
doesnt
matter
to
you
whether
an
unborn
child
has
any
rights
or
not
however
so
the
point
is
lost
on
you
more
irrelevancies
as
larry
margolis
pointed
out
the
law
has
made
special
exceptions
in
order
to
include
fetuses
but
does
not
follow
your
version
of
human
being
and
as
he
pointed
out
brain
death
is
not
a
means
of
determining
who
has
the
rights
of
the
living
but
rather
who
has
died
there
is
a
significant
difference
what
i
am
wondering
now
is
has
your
argument
so
failed
you
that
you
feel
it
necessary
to
drag
out
irrelevancies
and
leave
the
thread
you
started
you
got
answers
to
your
questions
when
you
began
baiting
me
if
you
recall
after
you
had
made
some
ridiculous
remarks
about
adrienne
regard
and
having
been
corrected
changed
the
subject
with
your
remarks
about
having
a
discussion
of
substance
if
you
really
wanted
a
discussion
of
substance
why
then
do
you
disregard
logic
and
substance
in
order
to
toss
silly
accussations
eg
it
really
doesnt
matter
to
you
if
it
matters
to
you
then
why
not
define
human
being
and
seek
some
substance
youre
not
going
to
convince
a
logical
person
of
the
rightness
of
your
position
unless
you
apply
some
logic
and
show
some
meaning
to
your
words
if
she
is
then
why
does
the
mother
have
the
right
to
kill
her
when
she
is
in
the
womb
but
not
after
she
has
passed
through
the
birth
canal
because
a
woman
has
a
right
to
have
any
object
which
threatens
her
health
and
is
within
the
confines
of
her
body
removed
the
other
side
of
the
argument
would
give
rights
to
the
fetus
that
would
not
be
granted
to
an
adult
human
if
for
example
you
were
occupying
the
body
of
another
for
whatever
reason
or
through
whatever
means
the
reason
and
means
being
irrelevant
that
other
would
be
able
to
remove
or
have
you
removed
if
that
removal
required
your
demise
i
see
no
reason
in
law
that
such
a
removal
could
not
be
effected
rather
than
examining
a
hypothetical
thought
experiment
let
us
examine
a
real
though
rare
situation
siamese
twins
if
one
siamese
twin
has
the
other
surgically
removed
knowing
that
it
will
cause
death
and
barring
some
emergency
where
they
will
both
die
anyway
it
is
murder
is
it
have
you
any
support
for
this
assertion
furthermore
your
analogy
is
completely
inapplicable
siamese
twins
have
an
equal
claim
to
any
body
parts
they
have
in
common
try
again
what
establishes
this
equal
claim
beyond
your
assertion
if
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
which
came
first
cannot
one
kill
the
other
since
they
both
have
equal
claim
what
if
one
has
more
motor
control
than
the
other
does
that
establish
a
superior
claim
as
others
point
out
one
is
sacrificed
for
the
other
depending
on
which
has
the
better
chance
at
survival
again
your
analogy
fails
not
precedence
but
possession
makes
a
difference
here
a
womans
womb
is
indisputably
her
own
also
i
see
you
ignore
my
statement
that
you
would
grant
rights
to
a
fetus
that
would
not
be
granted
a
born
human
being
was
that
due
to
its
inconvenience
you
see
the
right
to
life
is
granted
to
adult
humans
in
the
same
sense
as
it
should
be
to
the
foetus
at
some
point
prior
to
birth
are
siamese
twins
ever
separated
in
the
womb
or
is
this
right
you
assert
for
siamese
twins
which
i
dont
even
think
is
true
as
stated
or
valid
as
an
analogy
one
that
exists
after
birth
freivald
your
entire
argument
here
is
a
failure
interesting
way
of
trying
to
combine
two
essentially
orthogonal
concepts
the
point
is
that
it
is
murder
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
regardless
of
their
status
of
physiological
dependence
or
interdependence
is
it
please
cite
a
precedent
and
the
basis
of
the
ruling
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
inside
the
womb
and
even
if
it
were
possible
i
doubt
that
a
case
could
be
made
for
premeditation
or
neglegence
note
the
use
of
the
phrase
it
should
be
in
my
post
you
simply
assert
things
without
any
support
your
analogy
is
not
accurate
and
your
assertions
are
unsupported
try
this
on
for
size
it
is
not
murder
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
there
we
now
have
equal
arguments
but
the
idea
is
illogical
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
would
likely
be
to
kill
itself
as
well
the
systems
are
dependent
on
each
other
for
life
im
still
struggling
to
see
anything
analagous
here
and
failing
to
do
so
of
course
the
situation
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
it
may
well
be
that
one
siamese
twin
deliberately
initiates
oppression
or
coersion
against
the
other
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
with
an
unborn
child
and
this
last
statement
from
you
is
a
total
non
sequitur
the
comparison
is
far
worse
than
you
give
it
credit
for
are
you
going
to
let
this
assertion
stand
on
its
own
also
or
do
you
plan
on
following
up
with
a
reasoned
argument
your
argument
is
from
fantasy
island
your
comparison
is
a
total
failure
as
i
have
demonstrated
already
and
has
no
basis
in
reality
neither
legally
nor
medically
and
for
you
to
assert
that
it
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
because
of
the
impossible
that
of
coercion
or
oppression
is
ridiculous
as
i
said
you
give
the
analogy
too
little
credit
for
failure
on
the
one
hand
you
start
this
by
saying
you
want
to
take
a
real
rather
than
a
hypothetical
situation
then
you
fly
off
into
siamese
twins
murdering
one
another
in
the
womb
or
coercing
or
oppressing
each
other
in
the
womb
when
the
reality
of
the
situation
you
describe
in
now
way
matches
your
version
as
i
said
before
decisions
are
made
regarding
which
twin
lives
and
dies
in
situations
where
they
cannot
both
survive
and
furthermore
as
i
have
already
said
there
is
a
difference
between
an
equal
claim
to
organs
and
a
claim
that
is
unequal
you
seem
to
be
asserting
that
a
fetus
has
a
claim
on
a
womans
womb
when
the
fetus
is
born
what
happens
to
its
claim
and
by
what
reason
do
you
assert
its
claim
if
a
parent
has
the
right
to
choose
to
not
take
responsibility
for
their
own
child
why
are
there
laws
and
penalties
against
child
abandonment
this
last
question
is
irrelevant
and
something
of
a
non
sequitur
can
you
establish
some
relevance
or
even
some
sense
for
it
if
at
some
point
an
unborn
child
is
a
human
being
the
parents
clearly
have
the
same
responsibilities
toward
her
as
any
other
parents
have
toward
their
children
again
what
is
the
relevance
you
have
established
no
sense
of
when
that
point
is
you
ignore
the
significant
difference
between
a
fetus
and
a
born
child
the
dependence
of
a
born
child
can
be
transferred
to
another
party
while
that
of
a
fetus
cannot
a
born
child
does
not
live
within
the
body
of
another
human
being
while
a
fetus
does
thereby
representing
potential
and
often
actual
harm
to
that
body
as
in
the
case
of
one
of
our
talkabortion
participants
who
suffers
from
epilepsy
and
to
whom
pregnancy
represents
a
significant
health
risk
or
as
in
the
case
of
a
woman
i
know
who
chose
to
continue
her
pregnancy
but
spent
her
entire
pregnancy
confined
to
a
wheelchair
and
suffering
great
pain
from
constriction
of
some
nerve
and
your
argument
is
not
an
argument
against
abortion
generally
but
at
best
an
argument
against
abortion
at
some
time
during
the
course
of
pregnancy
again
a
quest
for
common
ground
most
of
the
prochoice
people
i
have
spoken
to
in
person
none
of
them
proabortion
activists
concede
that
the
child
has
a
right
to
life
at
some
point
that
supersedes
all
of
the
mothers
rights
except
that
of
her
own
life
as
is
often
the
case
in
emotionally
charged
issues
the
activists
have
a
very
different
outlook
from
the
mainstream
you
havent
answered
the
question
the
situations
are
not
analagous
the
dependence
of
a
born
child
is
not
transferred
instantaneously
it
takes
time
and
effort
incidentally
it
is
the
prochoice
side
not
me
arguing
that
the
government
should
make
it
easy
for
parents
to
abandon
their
children
to
the
state
again
you
avoid
the
question
dependence
can
be
transferred
and
it
is
not
as
slow
as
you
seem
to
think
as
to
the
anecdotal
evidence
of
real
human
tragedy
there
is
ample
on
both
sides
i
would
hate
to
be

the
position

has

she

i

i

subtle
for

in

you

she
behaves
very
differently

the

the

that

either
prolifers

it
is

theres

it
you

object
to

it
would
make

having

personal

caught
me
off

and
i
had
to
think
out
the
question
from
scratch
what
i
finally
decided
was
that
the
law
should
not
recognize
such
classes
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
formally
and
officially
declare
some
people
to
be
of
more
worth
than
others
and
that
would
be
anathema
to
the
underlying
american
concept
of
equal
treatment
under
the
law
last
year
when
a
federal
crime
bill
was
under
consideration
which
would
have
expanded
the
federal
death
penalty
to
an
additional
fiftyplus
crimes
including
the
murder
of
various
federal
officers
hitherto
not
protected
by
that
aura
of
deterrence
critics
pointed
out
the
absurdity
of
having
laws
which
made
the
death
penalty
available
for
the
murder
of
a
federal
postal
inspector
but
not
for
ther
murder
of
a
civilian
teacher
when
the
latter
arguably
provided
a
much
more
valueable
service
and
therefore
would
be
the
greater
loss
to
society
this
was
an
emotionally
compelling
argument
but
even
the
proponents
of
that
viewpoint
appeared
to
tacitly
assume
that
the
state
should
judge
some
lives
as
being
more
valuable
than
others
on
the
basis
of
their
contribution
to
society
i
view
that
doctrine
as
being
both
a
personally
repugnant
and
b
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
amendment
accordingly
i
believe
that
there
should
be
no
laws
which
give
any
professionbased
class
of
people
special
protection
via
the
mechanism
of
supplying
stronger
statutory
deterrence
of
crimes
against
members
of
that
class
not
even
police

with

of

one
point
seems
misdirected
when
standards

population
densities

industrial

controlled
for
the
united

is
no
less
energy

many

when
controlled
for

energy
efficiency
in
all
countries
turns
out
to
be
identical
to
take
population
density
as
an
example
one
way
to
reduce
energy
used
in
transportation
is
surely
to
concentrate
the
population
in
dense
urban
areas
though
this
might
of
course
have
other
disadvantages
possibly
even
relating
to
energy
use
the
fact
that
japan
is
forced
to
do
this
by
the
nature
of

it
may

to
reply
to
your
tirade
and
also
on
an
inaapropriate
board
but
along
with
all
of
the
so
called
great
things
the
white
male
has
done
they
have
also
contributed
to
society
by
means
of
mass
genocide
the
theft
of
ideas
and
cultures
creating
and
the
perptration
of
historical
lies
throughouttime
among
many
other
horrible
activities
but
every
culture
has
its
upside
and
its
downside
it
seems
to
me
that
the
white
male
must
be
extremely
ignorant
to
qualify
for
the
following
if
youre
not
disregard
and
western
culture
are
the
only
things
that
look
to
actively
classify
things
as
good
or
bad
worthy
or
unworthy
ya
dig
it
can
be
seen
with
slavery
and
the
manipulation
and
destruction
of
the
american
indians
civilization
nothing
but
selfish
acts
that
benefit
one
group
of
people
and
not
even
their
women
get
or
got
respected
or
regarded
as
equal
aint
that
some
stuff
white
men
not
being
specific
but
in
a
lot
of
cases
are
just
wack
or
have
wack
conceptions
of
how
the
world
is
to
serve
their
purpose
just
look
at
david
koresh
throughout
history
i
may
be
shortsighted
on
this
one
so
excuse
my
predjudiced
ignorance
only
white
men
associate
themselves
withbeing
god
no
other
culture
is
ignorant
or
arrogant
enough
to
assume
such
a
position
and
then
to
manipulate
and
mislead
all
those
people
hmmm
id
say
look
in
your
history
books

since
it
seems
that
history
has
been

youd

reposting
an
article
constitutes
posting
an
ad
then
i
am
guilty
this
post
did
have
a
name
and
address
and
yes
a
price
if
one
had
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
of
newsweek
would
that
be
an
ad
i
get
nothing
from
showing
this
stuff
i
posted
a
list
of
documents
showing
examples
of
the
kind
of
proof
that
was
requested
by
ted
frank
he
then
complains
to
my
sysadmin
saying
that
i
am
advertising
and
lo
and
behold
poof
there
goes
my
account
this
one
had
an
address
in
it
oh
no
i
guess
that
means
it
is
an
ad
if
you
value
the
alternative
view
i
have
been
discussing
or
value
its
discussion
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
it
i
ask
that
you
send
a
note
saying
as
much
to
me
to
show
to
the
sysadmin
they
rarely
get
ya
know
that
user
on
your
net
was
real
helpful
or
whatever
they
only
get
i
dont
like
what
that
user
is
doing
because
please
do
not
send
the
note
to
the
sysadmin
i
need
to
take
it
to
them
in
a
manner
that
has
at
least
a
chance
of
getting
through
in
my
files
here
are
hundreds
of
responses
from
people
saying
thanks
for
the
info
or
could
you
send
me
such
and
such
or
your
posts
are
very
interesting
keep
it
up
and
only
a
handfull
of
go
aways
but
i
guess
the
fact
that
i
have
decided
not
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
convince
ted
is
a
net
offensetm
of
such
magnitude
as
to
warrant
a
message
complaining
about
me
knock
knockmy
name
is
ted
and
and
this
is
mark
were
from
the
thought
police
seems
you
have
some
pretty
dangerous
ideas
here
and
were
here
to
confiscate
them
nwo
indeed
guess
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
come
up
with
a
new
plan
thanks
ted
and
mike
hope
you
are
happy
i
will
be
on
for
a
few
more
days
and
then
thats
all
folks
your
comments
and
support
are
requested
i
can
no
longer
post
to
news
i
ask
what
this
has
accomplished
is
there
some
benefit
from
making
alternative
views
simply
vanish
not
in
my
book
seems
the
easiest
way
to
win
an
argument
is
to
make
the
opposing
side
shut
up
images
of
waco
ah
but
alas
and
all
this
when
i
am
in
the
process
of
typing
in
a
letter
to
me
from
the
tax
collector
saying
that
a
lien
was
removed
due
to
a
letter
that
i
wrote
challenging
jurisdiction
oh
well
it
takes
time
to
come
up
with
the
info
requested
and
i
was
just
getting
started
it
should
be
noted
that
ted
frank
has
been
accused
publicly
over
times
of
being
an
nwo
supporter
and
has
never
made
an
statements
to
the
contrary
further
what
are
ted
franks
motivations
for
getting
me
axed
we
all
know
that
some
people
are
getting
paid
to
collect
info
on
people
on
the
net
that
are
of
interest
to
the
government
and
ted
sure
seems
to
have
a
personal
interest
in
debunking
me
hmmm
just
who
does
he
work
for
the
university
of
chicago
which
he
attends
is
well
known
as
one
of
the
biggest
nwo
supporters
and
finally
if
anyone
would
be
able
to
help
me
find
a
new
account
here
in
the
boulderdenver
area
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
i
am
in
the
process
of
installing
linux
and
so
will
be
able
to
do
uucp
or
maybe
a

any
help
here
would
be
greatly
appreciated
since
i
am
longer
be
able
to
post
news
and
will
no
longer
have

editors
note
the
reason
for
posting
the

from
the

was
to
show
what
the
problem
was
and
hopefully
correct
it
ted

its
inexcusable
to
post
lines
of

a

would
have
been
sufficient
resolution
lazlo
yes
i
agree
but
our
policy
is
to
not

makes
we
generally
let

i

this

we

unless
its
illegal
repetitive

harassment
or
something
else
that
offends
the

in
general
my
suggestion
is
that
you
take
it
to

and
explain
what
a

should
look
like

tell

obviously
ted

please
prevent

dont
just
reassert
your
opening
statement
for
those
in
the
dark
i
wrote
to

noting
that
a
he
wastes
bandwidth
by
posting
identical
messages
long
ones
to
several
newsgroups
independently
instead
of
crossposting
and
b
he
has
improperly
used
his
posts
to
advertise
goods
for
sale
a
i
was
requested
to
post
to
those
groups
and
they
were
getting
deleted
by
whom
b
the
goods
for

was
a
method
of
showing
the
source
and
obtaining
further
info
and
the
message
in
question
was
retrieved
in
its

from
the

i
simply
reposted
it
from
one
year
ago
would
there
be
a
complaint
if
i
had
posted
an
article
from
newsweek
then
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
how
about
the
subscription
info
for
the
american

review
bit
of
a
double
standard
yeah
think
so
no
indication
that
was
what
happened
until
now
editing
down
is
always
possible
readers
more
careful
than
aj
will
note
that
the

appended

expressly
disclaims
any

merely
because
they
are
infantile
irrational

oh
i
see
the
reason

your

had
nothing

your

im
not
sure
if
you
meant
to
imply
that
or
not
but
i
just
thought
id
bring
that
up
hitler
became
chancellor
because
people
voted
for
his
political
party
thats
not
a
huge
difference
in
a
parliamentary
system
your
statement
is
a
common
misconception
but
it
just
isnt
true
in
the
german
weimar
system
the
chancellor
was
not
necessarily
the
leader
of
the
largest
reichstag
party
the
chancellor
was
appointed
by
the
president
and
generally
was
the
leader
of
a
coalition
of
parties
who
could
form
an
effective
majority
in
the
reichstag
beyond
that
the
implication
that
hitler
rose
to
the
chancellorship
because
a
majority
of
germans
wanted
nazi
rule
is
false
as
well
before
president
hindenburg
appointed
hitler
chancellor
in
january
the
german
people
did
not
show
a
particular
desire
to
be
led
either
by
hitler
or
by
the
nazi
party
these
are
the
results
of
the
march
election
for
president
the
closest
hitler
ever
came
to
direct
election
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
duesterberg
in
the
runoff
election
in
april
the
results
were
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
so
we
can
see
that
hitler
personally
was
supported
by
only
about
a
third
of
german
voters
similarly
the
nazi
party
never
received
more
than
of
the
vote
in
reichstag
elections
that
occurred
in
july
in
the
november
election
the
nazis
lost
two
million
votes
and
seats
down
from
to
out
of
the
in
the
reichstag
comparitively
the
socialists
had
and
the
communists
the
communists
had
gained
seats
and
the
german
national
party
which
had
supported
the
previous
government
had
picked
up
a
million
of
the
nazis
lost
votes
to
gain
seats
up
to
i
think
the
other
large
party
was
the
catholic
center
party
i
dont
know
how
many
seats
they
had
but
i
think
they
were
declining
and
there
were
numerous
other
small
parties
thus
the
nazi
vote
was
on
the
decline
at
the
time
hitler
was
appointed
chancellor
what
brought
hitler
to
power
was
not
the
demand
of
the
german
people
for
hitler
or
the
nazis
to
run
things
but
the
inability
of
the
other
parties
to
put
their
differences
behind
them
in
favor
of
forming
an
effective
government
for
the
country
germany
did
not
have
an
enduring
democratic
tradition
and
their
parliamentary
system
lacked
effective
center
parties
that
favored
the
interests
of
the
majority
of
the
population
instead
what
they
had
was
a
number
of
small
parties
who
were
unable
to
put
aside
their
own
specific
objectives
in
order
to
combine
against
the
nazis
who
were
out
to
end
the
democratic
process
in
fact
part
of
the
problem
was
that
some
of
the
other
parties
with
substantial
representation
like
the
communists
were
also
out
to
end
the
democratic
process
but
with
different
results
in
mind
and
generally
didnt
mind
seeing
parliamentary
democracy
go
under
germany
had
already
had
a
nonnazi
chancellor
with
a
majority
coalition
for
five
months
while
the
nazis
had
been
the
largest
reichstag
party
and
there
certainly
was
no
danger
of
a
revolution
in
favor
of
the
nazis
if
anything
the
nazis
were
starting
to
get
desperate
because
they
had
failed
to
get
enough
support
to
make
hitler
president
and
their
popular
vote
had
begun
to
decline
hitler
was
not
hindenburgs
first
choice
to
be
chancellor
not
even
his
second
choice
first
von
papen
had
been
chancellor
since
june
after
the
november
election
when
the
nazis
lost
seats
hindenburg
first
prevailed
on
von
papen
to
remain
as
chancellor
but
there
were
intrigues
behind
his
back
and
support
for
him
was
lacking
so
then
hindenburg
turned
to
von
schleicher
who
became
chancellor
for
two
months
eventually
he
too
was
unable
to
hold
together
a
working
coalition
of
parties
to
oppose
the
nazis
who
refused
to
participate
in
any
government
that
was
not
led
by
a
nazi
chancellor
some
of
the
nazi
leadership
particularly
gregor
strasser
who
was
the
man
in
the
party
at
the
time
wanted
to
participate
in
a
coalition
government
but
others
knowing
the
partys
support
was
waning
figured
that
their
best
hope
to
gain
power
lay
in
undermining
the
democratic
process
nevertheless
the
country
was
governed
for
seven
months
by
chancellors
who
were
not
nazis
even
though
the
nazis
were
the
largest
reichstag
party
the
failure
of
these
men
to
achieve
a
working
coalition
was
due
to
the
inability
of
their
coalition
parties
to
work
together
heres
how
william
shirer
puts
it
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
third
reich
the
cardinal
error
of
the
germans
who
opposed
nazism
was
their
failure
to
unite
against
it
at
the
crest
of
their
popular
strength
in
july
the
national
socialists
had
attained
but
percent
of
the
vote
but
the
percent
of
the
german
people
who
expressed
their
opposition
to
hitler
were
much
too
divided
and
shortsighted
to
combine
against
a
common
danger
which
they
must
have
known
would
overwhelm
them
unless
they
united
however
temporarily
to
stamp
it
out
true
the
german
people
supported
hitler
after
he
became
chancellor
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
there
was
not
overwhelming
support
for
him
before
he
was
in
power
the
german
people
were
not
crying
out
for
hitler
to
take
over
no
matter
how
bad
economic
conditions
were
the
leftist
parties
socialistscommunists
probably
had
more
support
in
total
than
the
nazis
hitler
used
the
fact
that
others
were
passively
or
actively
willing
to
see
the
government
paralyzed
as
a
means
to
taking
it

not

if

a

with
a
potential

from
the

it
is
clear
that
the
effort
was
to
make
clintons
potential

appear
to
be
linked
to

with
absurd

not
to
be
taken
seriously
any
more
than
equivalent
tactics

would
have
been

the

such

i

you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forcing
others
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
if
we
had
backed
him
strongly
early
on
i
doubt
there
would
be
the
problem
there
is
now
many
russians
became
disillusioned
with
democracy
and
reforms
when
they
felt
rightly
imo
that
the
west
didnt
care
yeltsin
was
virtually
promised
massive
aid
once
bush
got
over
his
gorbymania
this
probably
kept
him
from
dismantling
the
congress
and
calling
for
new
elections
well
the
aid
didnt
come
through
and
we
didnt
make
sure
it
went
to
the
proper
places
and
now
the
antireformers
are
gaining
strength
where
before
they
were
in
hiding
have
you
considered
a
noninterventionist
policy
if
market
reform
does
happen
russia
will
certainly
get
private
capital
at
private
risk
to
help
their
economy
they
will
even
have
incentive
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
government
will
probably
consider
them
enemies
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
if
they
dont
reform
i
dont
believe
in
giving
them
money
however
i
think
this
is
too
important
to
take
a
noninterventionist
approach
this
is
what
really
bugs
me
about
libertarianism
it
sounds
like
itll
all
be
the
same
in
a
hundred
years
time
no
need
to
do
anything
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
if
a
billion
gift
was
that
important
to
our
well
being
couldnt
it
be
raised
voluntarilly
people
already
give
over
billion
a
year
to
charity
despite
the
wishes
of
libertarians
this
society
is
a
far
way
and
getting
farther
from
being
libertarian
perhaps
voluntary
gifts
would
work
if
we
had
the
proper
framework
but
we
do
not
have
it
we
have
to
face
the
problem
now
not
in
x
years
when
we
have
a
libertarian
dream
society
right
now
there
are
huge
stumbling
blocks
to
trade
let
alone
charity
there
are
still
limitations
to
hightech
exports
nasa
cant
buy
proton
launch
vehicles
from
them
sure
the
market
may
be
able
to
help
a
great
deal
but
it
cant
right
now
there
are
too
many
obstacles
instead
of
fighting
against
the
aid
you
should
be
fighting
to
tear
down
the
obstacles
the
market
and
charities
have
to
face
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someone
else
will
champion
welfare
or
education
or
doing
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
why
we
have
a
republic
and
not
a
true
democracy
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massive
scale
we
only
have
gridlock
on
a
congressional
scale
it
seems
instead
of
gridlock
on
any
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expensive
space
programs
national
charity
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probably
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limited
government
is
more
key
than
how
democratic
it
is
well
i
think
limited
government
is
primarily
democratic
due
to
it
being
limited
but
the
main
question
is
how
do
you
transform
a
staterun
economy
and
monolithic
government
into
something
that
even
remotely
looks
like
ours
btw
sometimes
it
seems
that
our
government
is
trying
to
go
the
opposite
direction
it
is
not
going
to
be
painless
and
not
going
to
be
easy
we
simply
cannot
wait
to
help
when
they
have
the
proper
government
theyll
never
get
there
without
the
aid
it
may
be
too
late
already
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
that
was
an
opinion
and
libertarians
are
very
big
on
free
speech
and
im
just
excercising
mine
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
then
you
should
be
very
libertarian
consider
it
a
compromise
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaiders
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppose
werent
using
the
same
government
machine
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
causes
you
dont
support
as
i
also
said
above
another
problem
i
have
is
with
transformation
a
libertarian
society
is
not
going
to
happen
painlessly
or
overnight
i
have
seen
nothing
about
how
to
take
our
current
government
and
society
and
turn
it
into
a
minimal
government
and
a
responsible
selfsufficient
populace
we
could
do
that
years
ago
but
not
now
people
have
been
saying
that
for
hundreds
of
years
they
didnt
have
nuclear
weapons
years
ago
nor
instantaneous
communications
nor
travel
to
virtually
anyplace
on
the
earth
in
less
than
a
day
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
making
all
the
more
reason
to
depend
on
the
free
market
which
can
more
efficiently
process
information
than
to
depend
on
rulers
for
decisions
on
complex
issues
yes
depend
on
the
rulers
of
the
free
market
and
the
businesses
rulers
do
emerge
somewhere
and
they
will
never
represent
the
opinions
of
every
person
on
the
planet
there
must
be
checks
and
balances
checks
on
the
government
when
it
gets
out
of
bounds
and
checks

youve
been
claiming
for
quite
a

now
that

according

now
your

is
that

some

theyre

hes
going

and
the

going

rule
that

is

heterosexuality

we

death

that

so
you
could
as

complain
about

barbaric
way
of

but
the
death
penalty
is
right
and
how

an

i

i

rope
cyanide

perhaps

oh

the

is

can

why

isnt

just
being

again
to
deter
an
epidemic
of
gay

that
has
not

by
assault
laws
so
we
ought
to
make
beating
up
a
homosexual
more
illegal
than
beating
up
a
straight
silly
me
thinking
that
the
issue
was
that
we
are
all
people
to
be
treated
equally
thanks
for
straightening
me
out
wrong
if
a
bunch
of
faggots
from
the
tenderloin
decide
to
go
straight
bashing
and
they
selectively
target
a
heterosexual
man
and
beat
the
bloody
fuck
out
of
him
they
would
get
charged
as
well
under
all
the
federal
laws
that
exist
about
violation
of
civils
rights
the
focus
of
their
intent
is
his
sexual
orientation
and
so
the
law
applies
to
them
as
well
the
national
government
retains
the
right
to
make
any
laws
necessary
to
sufficiently
deter
and
punish
any
crime
against
someones
civil
rights
until
that
behavior
becomes
so
well
punished
that
nobody
even
tries
it
the
fact
is
that
at
last
count
gays
were
not
beating
straights
for
their
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
is
getting
applied
only
to
the
straights
who
indulge
themselves
the
federal
government
or
judiciary
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
under
law
even
if
it
takes
possible
charges
against
people
who
would
violate
them
go
read
your
constitutional
law
we
broke
the
back
of
the
kkks
harrassment
campaign
with
the
same
strategy
in
the
early
so
many
went
to
jail
and
for
so
long
that
it
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
kkk
rsw
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
was
with
the
current
mutation
of
the
us
constitution
under
the
current
police
state
someone
may
be
charged
multiple
times
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
single
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charge
thats
almost
like
if
four
cops
got
acquitted
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
charges
and
the
country
went
and
tried
them
again
and
again
until
they
oh
never
mind
this
mutation
as
you
call
it
protects
your
little
butt
too
if
you
happen
to
be
somewhere
where
youre
the
wrong
shade
for
somebody
elses
taste
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
motive
for
the
assault
on
you
was
racially
motivated
then
the
full
power
of
these
extra
laws
that
bring
more
charges
and
punishments
will
come
against
those
who
harmed
you
the
first
use
of
such
laws
was
well
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
constitutional
scholars
of
all
conviction
recognize
that
this
right
reserved
to
the
federal
government
is
well
established
and
not
just
some
shortlived
peculiarity
too
go
read
some
constitutional
law
for
awhile
maybe
youll

this

commie
lib
pinko
to
have
these
views
dmeiercasbahacnsnwuedu
you
know
i
have
thought
about
the
issue
of
if
someone
beats
up
a
homosexual
or
a
black
person
etc
should
the
crime
be
specified
as
something
special
shit
beating
up
anybody
regardless
of
race
and
sexual
orientation
should
be
a
very
serious
crime
if
you
pick
out
those
crimes
which
are
committed
against
the
opposite
sex
different
race
or
a
different
sexual
orientation
is
this
a
form
of
favoring
those
groups
over
other
groups
hmm
i
mean
i
think
that
a
crime
committed
against
all
people
should
be
treated
the
same
but
i
know
that
there
are
many
people
out
there
who
are
very
prejudice
against
people
who
are
different
than
they
are
and
perhaps
hate
crimes
laws
are
the
only
way
to
punish
the
bastards
appropriately
but
why
should
a
person
who
commits
a
crime
against
a
wealthy
protestant
white
by
a
wealthy
protestant
white
be
treated
on
a
lower
level
isnt
this
discrimination
against
the
wealthy
white
person
hmm
any
input
out
there
as
a
black
person
i
here
about
all
sorts
of
stories
where
fellow
blacks
are
persecuted
and
beat
up
because
of
their
race
this
really
tears
me
up
but
a
crime
against
a
white
by
a
white
should
also
be
treated
as
a
heinous
crime
please
respond
i
would
like
to
hear
what
other
views
are
out
ther
ciao
mimi
the
federal
government
has
used
such
laws
to
allow
mutliple
charges
in
order
to
prevent
more
crimes
than
would
nromally
occur
just
from
two
people
being
pissed
off
at
each
other
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
the
intent
of
the
perpetrators
in
the
pursuit
of
preventing
violations
of
civil
rights
its
the
way
they
broke
the
back
of
the
klan
by
putting
a
lot
of
people
away
for
a
very
long
time
for
harrassing
blacks
specifically
it
is
a
principle
that
has
been
well
recognized
as
constitutionally
valid
since
over
years
ago
it
has
been
used
whenever
a
select
group
was
getting
bashed
or
harrassed
more
than
any
other
person
would
just
for
being
part
of
a
minority
it
is
the
only
way
we
made
the
defeat
of
the
south
stick
after
the
civil
war
people
who
harrassed
free
blacks
when
normally
they
wouldnt
find
themselves
harrassing
just
anyone
walking
around
were
expeditiously
tried
and
jailed
for
to
years
until
nobody
wanted
to
try
it
anymore
now
with
the
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
under
the
law
the
law
can
use
multiple
crime
and
severe
penalty
involving
intent
as
much
as
is
needed
to
protect
even
one
human
that
is
a
hated
minority
to
somebody
they
can
call
out
the
national
guard
just
for
them
as
they
did
the
school
girls
in
alabama
during
desegregation
in
the
and
the
president
can
nationalize
the
state
militia
and
turn
the
guns
of
the
militia
that
were
being
used
to
bar
blacks
right
around
to
point
at
the
thousands
in
the
crowd
with
an
order
to
shoot
that
they
would
have
to
obey
or
face
possible
death
by
firing
squad
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
for
failing
to
obey
a
direct
order
while
under
arms
and
by
god
they
did
those
southern
boys
turned
right
around
an
fixed
bayonets
and
the
governor
was
left
standing
and
was
arrested
by
the
federal
marshalls
that
had
brought
the
order
to
nationalize
the
guard
and
thats
why
we
need
such
an
ability
in

jurisdiction

april
in
thomas
jefferson
was
born
years
ago
i
think
thats
appropriate
to
mention
at
the
beginning
of
this
meeting
because
since
that
time
he
has
been
of
course
a
person
who
has
been
one
that
weve
all
followed
in
terms
of
our
democracy
and
the
importance
of
education
here
in
this
great
country
the
success
of
our
democracy
according
to
jefferson
really
depends
upon
the
success
of
our
educational
system
his
philosophy
of
government
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
education
is
also
very
meaningful

ill
ask
you

at

mr

members
of
my
cabinet
at

headquarters
of
the
chamber
of

support
the
effort
that
the
chamber
is
making
along
with
its
center
for
work
force
preparation
to
help
to
examine
tonight
the
whole
critical
question
of
how
to
move
our
young
people
from
school
to
the
work
place
i
want
to
compliment
the
chamber
on
all
their
efforts
recognizing
that
without
an
educated
work
force
we
cant
grow
this
economy
or
remain
competitive
and
recognizing
that
we
all
have
to
work
together
business
and
government
labor
and
educators
to
make
things
happen
this
satellite
town
meeting
is
a
good
example
of
that
kind
of
working
together
and
if
youll
forgive
me
a
little
home
state
pride
i
want
to
say
a
special
word
of
thanks

several
hundred

the
sites

this
town

a
lot
as
well
as
the
sites

all
the
rest
of
you
i
have
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
move
toward
constructive
change
for
this
country
secretary
riley
talked
about
this
being
thomas
jeffersons
birthday
if
thomas
jefferson
believed
in
anything
he
believed
in
these
three
things
first
in
education
second
in
real
personal
liberty
freedom
of
religion
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
association
freedom
of
the
press
and
third
in
the
absolute
imperative
of
changing
as
times
change
if
you
go
to
the
jefferson
memorial
here
in
this
beautiful
city
which
is
now
bedecked
with
all
of
its
wonderful
cherry
blossoms
you
will
see
jefferson
saying
that
we
have
to
change
with
changing
times
for
us
here
in
america
that
means
reducing
our
deficit
and
increasing
our
investment
and
putting
our
people
first
so
that
we
can
compete
in
the
world
were
here
to
talk
about
that
tonight
about
what
we
can
do
to
educate
and
train
our
people
better
unless
we
do
that
none
of
the
efforts
that
all
the
rest
of
us
make
in
government
even
to
bring
the
budget
into
balance
even
to
increase
our
investment
in
other
things
which
will
grow
jobs
will
last
in
the
long
run
we
also
have
to
have
people
who
can
carry
their
load
and
in
a
world
where
the
average
young
person
will
change
jobs
seven
or
eight
times
in
a
lifetime
that
begins
with
the
education
system
and
continues
into
the
work
force
where
education
must
go
on
for
a
lifetime
its
not
just
important
what
you
know
but
what
you
can
learn
and
if
i
might
id
like
to
close
just
by
emphasizing
were
doing
our
best
to
try
to
have
the
most
innovative
partnership
between
the
labor
department
and
the
education
department
and
the
private
sector
to
build
a
good
schooltowork
transition
and
were
trying
to
get
off
to
a
good
start
this
summer
with
a
program
that
would
create
more
than
new
summer
jobs
including
many
thousands
that
have
a
strong
education
component
so
our
young
people
can
be
learning
and
working
at
the
same
time
dick
i
think
i
ought
to
stop
there
thats
a
good
place
we
can
begin
i
think
the
discussion
secretary
riley
thank
you
so
much
mr
president
each
month
we
get
together
and
talk
about
ways
that
all
citizens
can
work
towards
reaching
the
national
education
goals
and
tonight
well
focus
on
goal
five
and
how
communities
such
as
yours
can
prepare
students
for
this
world
of
work
this
week
the
education
department
and
the
labor
department
are
hosting
a
conference
here
in
washington
dc
called
summer
challenge
a
program
of
work
and
learning
to
americas
youth
the
aim
is
to
use
some
special
funds
from
president
clintons
proposed
economic
stimulus
package
to
provide
educationallyenriched
jobs
and
summer
school
programs
for
young
people
in
disadvantaged
areas
of
the
country
mr
president
lets
talk
a
minute
you
alluded
to
it
somewhat
about
the
summer
youth
challenge
your
program
calls
for
more
educational
enrichment
in
the
summer
jobs
and
why
in
your
words
is
that
so
important
the
president
i
think
its
important
for
two
reasons
first
of
all
a
lot
of
the
young
people
were
trying
to
reach
may
have
had
trouble
adjusting
to
school
and
learning
and
while
we
want
them
to
have
a
good
experience
with
a
real
job
we
also
want
them
to
continue
to
learn
during
the
summer
because
we
know
from
a
lot
of
research
that
a
lot
of
kids
that
have
trouble
learning
in
school
may
forget
as
much
as
percent
of
what
they
learned
the
previous
year
over
the
summertime
and
that
is
a
very
unproductive
thing
for
schools
to
have
to
take
up
a
lot
of
time
teaching
what
they
already
taught
before
secondly
we
want
to
help
these
young
people
progress
not
only
in
terms
of
work
but
in
terms
of
learning
we
want
to
abolish
the
artificial
dividing
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learning
because
we
think
that
the
best
and
most
productive
workers
will
have
to
be
lifetime
learners
and
we
think
that
this
experience
could
maybe
drive
that
point
home
and
prepare
these
young
people
to
succeed
in
school
or
at
work
or
in
college
as
they
go
on
secretary
riley
well
i
think
the
fact
that
these
are
disadvantaged
kids
that
gap
that
lag
you
mentioned
as
they
go
into
the
next
year
is
really
even
greater
secretary
reich
of
course
you
have
training
programs
throughout
the
year
and
i
wonder
is
you
have
any
comment
about
this
educational
component
of
training
secretary
reich
well
what
weve
learned
mr
secretary
is
that
for
many
young
people
whether
its
for
the
summer
or
for
the
year
actually
onthejob
work
experience
combined
with
education
is
one
of
the
best
ways
of
learning
many
young
people
for
example
have
a
lot
they
have
a
difficult
time
learning
geometry
but
when
they
actually
are
there
building
something
or
working
on
something
and
they
can
see
the
exact
and
direct
application
of
geometry
they
understand
what
its
used
for
and
a
lot
of
young
people
just
that
sense
of
connection
between
education
and
the
world
of
work
is
terribly
terribly
important
its
important
during
the
summer
but
its
important
for
a
lot
of
young
people
even
beyond
the
summer
secretary
riley
thank
you
mr
president
youve
called
for
a
youth
apprenticeship
program
schooltowork
transition
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
your
concept
of
that
and
how
you
see
it
developing
the
president
well
first
of
all
lets
talk
about
why
its
important
most
new
jobs
that
will
be
created
in
this
decade
will
not
require
a
fouryear
college
degree
but
most
of
them
will
require
some
learning
and
skills
that
go
well
beyond
what
most
people
get
in
a
high
school
diploma
if
you
look
at
the
last
years
the
average
salaries
of
young
people
that
had
at
least
two
years
of
good
posthigh
school
education
was
a
good
salary
that
went
up
over
the
decade
the
young
people
who
had
less
than
that
tended
to
have
lower
wages
that
did
not
go
up
and
in
many
cases
in
real
terms
fell
over
the
decade
because
they
werent
productive
they
werent
more
valuable
to
their
employers
so
we
think
america
has
a
big
economic
interest
in
trying
to
ensure
that
all
the
young
people
who
get
out
of
high
school
but
dont
go
on
to
college
make
a
transition
to
work
which
includes
two
years
of
further
training
either
in
a
community
college
a
vocational
setting
or
perhaps
on
the
job
and
what
i
have
done
in
this
budget
as
you
know
is
to
give
you
and
secretary
reich
some
funds
and
some
incentives
to
try
to
work
in
partnership
with
states
and
with
the
private
sector
to
build
these
programs
statebystate
in
a
way
that
would
be
customized
essentially
by
the
business
community
based
on
the
needs
of
the
economy
in
any
given
area
it
could
revolutionize
longterm
the
quality
of
the
american
work
force
and
the
earnings
of
american
workers
secretary
reich
i
should
add
mr
president
i
think
you
know
this
from
your
experience
in
arkansas
and
many
of
the
people
watching
this
program
that
the
business
community
and
educators
labor
groups
are
already
in
many
of
our
communities
many
of
our
states
building
a
schooltowork
transition
program
in
fact
theres
an
awful
lot
of
ferment
a
lot
of
excitement
the
people
watching
this
program
probably
are
the
ones
who
are
most
directly
involved
in
that
and
more
power
to
them
secretary
riley
and
i
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
build
on
the
successes
already
out
there
secretary
riley
bob
were
going
to
be
talking
tonight
about
youth
apprenticeship
and
tech
prep
the
coop
learning
career
academies
and
what
features
all
those
programs
that
deal
with
this
subject
what
are
some
of
the
features
that
every
one
of
these
schooltowork
programs
might
have
that
are
important
secretary
reich
well
one
thing
that
weve
seen
and
you
and
i
have
been
working
at
this
for
a
long
time
and
you
much
longer
than
i
weve
seen
that
active
involvement
of
the
business
community
is
absolutely
essential
and
im
so
delighted
that
were
doing
this
in
the
headquarters
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
is
committed
to
doing
these
kinds
of
programs
training
education
retraining
and
weve
aimed
to
work
very
closely
with
the
chamber
the
business
community
is
going
to
be
actively
engaged
in
developing
almost
an
audit
of
the
kind
of
jobs
that
are
needed
and
helping
the
educators
community
colleges
technical
institutions
develop
curricula
that
are
relevant
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
communities
have
got
to
come
together
i
mean
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
youve
got
to
have
all
of
these
players
in
a
community
come
together
and
work
together
and
cooperate
together
you
know
too
often
we
have
the
educators
over
here
and
the
business
leaders
over
here
labor
groups
over
here
and
everybody
is
talking
but
theyre
not
really
working
together
in
a
common
strategy
and
the
third
and
final
ingredient
i
would
say
dick
would
be
a
commitment
to
excellence
a
commitment
both
to
academic
excellence
and
also
to
skills
development
excellence
this
is
not
a
tracking
program
were
talking
about
for
kids
who
are
not
going
to
make
it
this
is
a
program
that
every
young
person
ought
to
be
eligible
for
if
they
want
to
go
on
beyond
that
to
fouryear
college
thats
fine
that
ought
to
be
permissible
but
were
talking
about
the
foundation
of
learning
about
jobs
the
foundation
skills
for
onthejob
learning
and
again
those
are
the
critical
components
its
already
being
done
the
president
i
think
if
i
might
just
interject
one
point
based
on
my
personal
experience
at
home
the
business
community
has
a
critical
role
to
play
not
simply
in
saying
here
are
the
job
skills
that
are
needed
and
heres
what
ought
to
be
taught
but
also
in
monitoring
that
excellence
if
you
have
the
right
sort
of
partnership
there
the
people
who
are
paying
the
taxes
and
who
are
going
to
then
be
hiring
the
workers
are
not
going
to
permit
the
secondrate
programs
to
survive
if
they
have
any
way
to
shape
and
influence
them
so
i
think
thats
very
important
and
when
we
try
to
if
you
will
fill
in
the
blanks
at
the
federal
level
trying
to
set
some
standards
and
provide
some
funds
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
be
sure
and
do
is
to
make
sure
that
the
employer
has
a
heavy
amount
of
influence
over
the
quality
of
these
programs
because
thats
really
whats
going
to
determine
whether
the
whole
thing
is
worthwhile
secretary
riley
thats
great
weve
been
talking
of
course
about
schooltowork
and
also
the
jobs
and
economic
recovery
program
for
this
summer
and
fall
but
lets
talk
just
a
moment
about
longterm
school
reform
its
something
especially
close
to
me
mr
president
i
wonder
if
you
would
give
us
some
of
your
ideas
for
the
communities
out
here
on
goals
legislation
that
i
think
will
be
coming
forth
before
too
long
the
president
well
as
you
know
back
when
you
and
i
were
both
governors
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
working
on
our
public
schools
and
we
tried
to
be
very
candid
with
our
people
in
saying
that
a
lot
of
these
things
were
going
to
take
some
time
to
materialize
i
had
a
hand
in
writing
the
national
education
goals
that
the
governors
drafted
along
with
representatives
of
president
bushs
administration
back
in
and
what
were
going
to
try
to
do
this
year
with
your
leadership
is
to
introduce
legislation
in
congress
that
will
actually
define
the
things
that
the
national
government
ought
to
do
to
try
to
help
the
local
schools
and
the
children
of
this
country
and
the
adult
learners
too
meet
those
goals
making
sure
that
when
by
people
show
up
for
school
ready
to
learn
that
we
get
a
percent
ontime
high
school
graduation
rate
that
children
at
the
and
grades
are
confident
in
the
subjects
theyre
supposed
to
know
that
they
are
second
to
none
in
math
and
science
that
are
schools
are
safe
disciplined
and
drugfree
and
of
course
the
fifth
goal
i
took
them
out
of
line
to
say
this
the
last
is
that
we
have
a
system
of
lifelong
learning
in
this
country
and
each
one
of
those
goals
theres
a
national
role
a
state
role
a
school
role
school
district
role
and
a
private
sector
role
and
what
youve
attempted
to
do
in
this
bill
youre
going
to
introduce
with
me
in
the
next
few
weeks
is
to
define
what
our
job
is
and
then
to
give
the
rest
of
america
a
way
of
defining
what
their
job
is
and
seeing
whether
were
actually
meeting
the
standards
of
quality
that
we
need
to
meet
its
very
exciting
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
quite
like
it
has
ever
been
done
in
the
form
of
federal
legislation
before
not
mandating
and
telling
people
what
they
have
to
do
with
their
money
but
actually
setting
up
a
framework
for
excellence
and
partnerships
so
that
we
can
do
our
job
im
really
excited
about
it
secretary
riley
well
i
am
too
and
i
think
really
it
will
be
an
entirely
new
role
for
the
federal
government
in
terms
of
its
relationship
with
states
serving
as
a
partner
really
to
support
and
facilitate
and
to
help
out
in
these
education
reform
efforts
all
driven
by
high
standards
thats
the
point
bob
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
then
well
get
to
the
telephone
calls
its
about
the
same
subject
we
have
of
course
skills
standards
that
are
going
to
be
part
of
goals
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
comment
on
that
secretary
reich
well
you
know
we
have
percent
of
our
young
people
who
dont
graduate
from
college
very
often
they
dont
have
very
many
alternatives
they
do
have
a
wonderful
system
of
community
colleges
and
technical
institutions
but
if
we
had
national
skill
standards
to
which
they
could
aspire
and
which
employers
would
understand
as
a
national
credential
many
of
these
young
people
would
actually
find
that
they
were
much
more
eligible
for
jobs
everybody
doesnt
have
to
go
to
college
other
countries
you
have
smaller
proportions
of
their
population
going
to
college
but
you
have
a
whole
level
of
people
who
have
certain
technical
preprofessional
skills
we
can
do
it
in
this
country
if
you
dont
go
to
fouryear
college
youre
not
a
loser
and
we
want
to
develop
those
national
skill
standards
were
going
to
be
working
with
the
states
with
the
education
department
with
a
lot
of
private
industry
in
developing
those
standards
and
i
think
they
will
be
the
kinds
of
things
that
enable
our
vocational
and
technical
and
other
institutions
to
rally
around
as
well
as
our
business
community
secretary
riley
well
thats
great
why
dont
we
go
ahead
and
go
to
the
telephone
we
have
a
call
i
see
mayor
bruce
todd
of
austin
texas
q
yes
mr
president
and
mr
secretary
reich
and
riley
we
certainly
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
join
you
today
we
have
some
dedicated
professionals
and
volunteers
here
in
austin
who
have
heard
what
you
have
said
and
are
very
appreciative
let
me
simply
say
amen
to
some
of
the
comments
made
already
we
agree
with
much
of
the
tone
that
the
clinton
administration
has
taken
and
are
very
supportive
we
have
been
successful
here
in
austin
of
tripling
our
summer
employment
program
over
the
last
four
years
we
expect
to
have
over
employed
this
year
in
the
summertime
perhaps
as
much
as
with
the
federal
assistance
much
of
the
question
that
we
had
designed
you
have
answered
in
your
opening
comments
so
we
must
be
thinking
alike
but
the
question
essentially
involved
what
initiatives
after
labor
day
would
be
appropriate
we
know
summertime
is
important
yearround
is
even
more
important
and
what
kind
of
initiatives
at
the
federal
level
might
be
proposed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
youth
on
a
year
round
basis
and
perhaps
more
importantly
how
can
families
and
the
local
community
be
more
involved
using
the
federal
initiative
thats
something
that
we
believe
is
very
important
to
success
in
this
effort
secretary
riley
mr
president
the
president
i
think
ill
give
everybody
a
chance
to
answer
the
question
bruce
but
let
me
first
thank
you
for
calling
and
thank
you
for
all
the
great
work
that
youre
doing
in
austin
ive
seen
some
of
it
and
ive
always
been
very
impressed
first
with
regard
to
the
summer
program
we
hope
we
can
structure
it
in
a
way
that
will
enable
us
to
continue
the
summer
program
and
that
will
move
a
lot
of
these
young
people
back
into
schools
under
circumstances
that
might
allow
them
to
do
some
work
in
the
private
sector
too
we
hope
that
secretary
reich
is
going
to
try
to
set
up
a
system
where
we
create
a
lot
of
private
sector
jobs
to
be
matched
with
the
public
sector
jobs
this
summer
and
were
working
on
that
secondly
in
the
program
that
i
have
presented
to
the
congress
over
the
next
five
years
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
build
in
an
amount
of
investment
thats
quite
substantial
for
job
training
programs
for
schooltowork
programs
all
of
which
give
heavy
heavy
weight
to
local
community
input
just
the
question
you
asked
but
do
provide
some
federal
investment
dollars
which
we
hope
you
can
put
with
local
dollars
to
keep
people
working
and
being
trained
on
a
yearround
basis
and
i
will
say
again
to
echo
what
secretary
reich
said
a
moment
ago
to
try
to
break
down
the
barrier
between
what
is
seen
as
work
and
what
is
seen
as
learning
an
awful
lot
of
young
people
actually
have
quite
high
iqs
but
actually
learn
so
much
better
when
theyre
doing
than
when
theyre
reading
or
just
listening
so
we
hope
that
the
community
involvement
part
of
it
will
be
permanent
and
we
hope
that
if
the
whole
budget
passes
and
we
do
have
budget
cuts
and
more
than
actually
in
the
budget
and
some
revenue
raisers
and
some
new
money
for
education
and
training
that
well
be
able
to
do
just
what
you
seem
to
want
based
on
your
question
bob
do
you
want
to
say
anything
secretary
reich
well
you
took
most
of
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
mr
president
as
usual
but
let
me
just
add
one
thing
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
posthigh
school
for
a
lot
of
young
people
who
are
not
going
on
to
college
in
addition
to
the
schooltowork
program
simply
is
the
availability
of
jobs
and
weve
got
to
get
this
economy
moving
again
obviously
its
terribly
important
to
get
this
recovery
program
to
get
the
economy
back
on
track
thats
sort
of
the
prerequisite
to
everything
else
if
we
dont
get
the
economy
back
on
track
we
have
i
think
this
is
the
correct
me
if
im
wrong
mr
president
i
think
is
the
month
we
have
had
seven
percent
unemployment
or
greater
this
is
a
jobless
recovery
a
lot
of
those
kids
are
going
to
be
getting
out
of
school
in
june
and
even
if
we
did
everything
right
they
would
have
a
very
very
hard
time
getting
jobs
secretary
riley
thank
you
both
of
course
goals
will
be
a
permanent
longterm
thing
that
will
certainly
reach
into
next
year
it
will
involve
if
passed
and
we
certainly
hope
it
will
be
action
plans
with
every
state
where
we
can
be
working
together
to
reach
for
the
goals
in
a
number
of
different
ways
and
then
the
state
with
all
the
various
school
districts
a
very
important
part
of
that
will
be
citizen
and
parent
involvement
and
i
think
everybody
will
see
a
great
energy
out
there
once
we
get
that
moving
the
next
call
is
dr
harry
heinemann
new
york
doctor
q
good
evening
mr
secretary
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
on
with
you
this
evening
as
you
may
know
bridging
the
school
and
work
has
been
central
to
la
guardias
educational
program
since
its
inception
in
the
and
that
includes
the
college
the
two
alternative
high
schools
that
operate
on
our
campus
and
the
linkages
we
have
forged
with
the
local
schools
we
have
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
effective
learning
strategy
and
over
the
years
weve
come
to
believe
that
there
are
several
principles
that
are
very
important
in
bridging
the
school
and
work
and
these
include
integrating
theory
in
the
classroom
with
practice
in
the
workplace
with
providing
all
students
early
exposure
to
careers
as
well
as
providing
opportunities
for
them
to
reflect
upon
these
experiences
while
they
strengthen
their
skills
and
lastly
the
critical
role
of
the
liberal
arts
particularly
in
the
development
of
high
performance
competencies
my
question
then
is
how
can
the
general
education
faculty
and
the
academic
curriculum
be
more
closely
integrated
with
transition
to
work
experience
and
what
mechanisms
and
strategies
can
you
suggest
to
achieve
this
integration
secretary
riley
well
thank
you
very
much
i
think
and
well
get
a
response
from
you
all
on
that
and
very
interesting
work
going
on
there
were
going
to
have
three
people
our
next
guests
on
the
program
this
evening
that
will
be
some
specialists
in
that
area
that
youre
speaking
and
ill
certainly
pass
that
on
to
them
and
we
can
discuss
it
later
you
all
care
to
comment
any
comments
you
might
have
the
president
id
just
like
to
say
if
i
might
one
thing
i
want
to
reemphasize
this
and
i
dont
think
im
being
as
clear
about
it
as
id
like
although
i
think
at
least
one
of
the
people
who
will
be
on
the
second
panel
will
be
able
to
say
it
more
explicitly
than
i
i
think
this
whole
concept
of
applied
academics
is
very
important
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
basically
abolish
what
i
consider
to
be
a
very
artificial
distinction
between
what
is
vocational
learning
and
what
is
academic
learning
i
think
we
should
keep
the
liberal
arts
going
i
think
we
should
have
a
strong
component
for
people
who
are
in
the
vocational
program
secretary
reich
it
seems
to
me
that
we
also
need
to
rethink
our
entire
tracking
system
because
a
lot
of
these
school
and
work
combinations
are
important
for
mainstream
students
theyre
important
for
all
students
its
not
just
a
special
group
of
students
that
needs
them
some
of
the
experiments
that
ive
seen
around
the
united
states
dick
im
sure
youve
seen
them
as
well
are
mainstream
experiments
theyre
mainstreaming
all
the
students
at
and
grades
theyre
giving
them
a
combined
work
and
school
experience
and
then
a
transition
program
and
again
the
kids
can
either
go
on
to
college
if
they
want
they
can
go
on
to
technical
community
they
can
go
on
to
an
entirely
a
large
variety
of
possibilities
and
career
directions
but
we
have
to
get
away
from
the
stigmatizing
that
often
goes
on
with
young
people
who
simply
are
doing
jobrelated
or
work
related
work
within
the
classroom
within
our
schools
secretary
riley
thank
you
very
much
i
think
thats
going
to
be
the
last
call
that
we
have
time
for
mr
president
i
think
youve
got
to
move
on
to
another
matter
and
i
want
to
thank
you
and
secretary
reich
for
being
here
we
appreciate
your
time
and
your
ideas
and
its
been
a
tremendous
help
to
us

i
want
to

a

to
the

for
providing
several
hundred

procedural
note

while
i
respect
his
right
to

so
my
own
opinions
are
that
followupto
fields
are
mere
suggestions
not
mandatory
commands
and
this
issue
is
of
sufficient
a
general
political
relevance
and
b
civil
liberties
interest
to
warrant
keeping
it
active
in
tpm
and
ascl
as
well
at
least
for
this
round
in
article
said
uh
no
thats
not
what
happened
in
boomer
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
and
required
the
plant
to
pay
the
plaintiffs
the
to
make
them
whole
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
okay
now
heres
my
interpretation
of
boomer
based
on
the
facts
as
presented
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
holding
boomer
v
note
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
the
highest
court
in
new
york
state
while
the
united
states
and
of
the
fifty
states
call
their
highest
court
supreme
court
supreme
judicial
court
or
supreme
court
of
appeals
maryland
and
new
york
call
theirs
simply
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
matters
worse
new
york
also
calls
its
secondhighest
court
the
supreme
court
appellate
division
atlantic
cement
co
oscar
h
boomer
et
al
owned
land
near
the
atlantic
cement
companys
plant
near
albany
ny
the
fact
pattern
gives
no
information
as
to
which
came
first
the
plaintiffs
acquisition
of
the
land
or
he
defendants
start
of
production
at
their
cement
plant
in
the
course
of
its
regular
operations
the
cement
plant
did
injury
to
the
plaintiffs
property
via
dirt
smoke
and
vibrations
emanating
from
the
plant
the
plaintiffs
sought
injunctive
relief
that
is
they
asked
the
court
to
order
atlantic
cement
to
stop
damaging
their
property
commentary
this
seems
entirely
reasonable
to
me
boomer
at
al
owned
their
property
and
presumably
a
right
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
it
atlantic
cements
actions
were
depriving
boomer
et
al
of
that
right
instead
of
granting
the
plaintiffs
request
for
an
injunction
the
court
ordered
them
to
accept
the
damage
being
done
to
their
property
provided
that
atlantic
cement
paid
them
in
compensatory
damages
in
other
words
the
court
granted
atlantic
cement
co
a
private
party
the
power
and
authority
to
take
the
plaintiffs
rights
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
property
by
eminent
domain
a
taking
by
eminent
domain
is
always
problematical
even
when
its
done
by
the
state
allowing
a
private
firm
to
do
it
is
in
my
opinion
totally
wrong
yes
i
know
the
boomer
court
didnt
call
it
eminent
domain
but
if
it
walks
like
eminent
domain
and
swims
like
eminent
domain
and
quacks
like
eminent
domain
let
me
take
issue
with
the
way
youve
presented
the
case
you
say
that
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
blackmail
pulls
out
blacks
law
dictionary
abridged
edition
blackmail
unlawful
demand
of
money
or
property
under
threat
to
do
bodily
harm
to
injure
property
to
accuse
of
crime
or
to
expose
disgraceful
defects
this
crime
is
commonly
included
under
extortion
statutes
how
do
you
define
as
blackmail
one
partys
act
of
demanding
the
right
to
set
its
own
sale
price
for
a
unique
piece
of
property
which
it
owns
and
which
another
party
has
expressed
an
interest
in
buying
or
of
demanding
the
right
not
to
sell
that
property
at
any
price
as
i
see
it
boomer
et
al
having
found
themselves
in
the
fortunate
position
of
owning
something
which
atlantic
cement
had
to
purchase
if
it
wanted
to
stay
in
business
had
every
right
in
the
world
to
set
whatever
price
they
wanted
there
isnt
or
at
least
shouldnt
be
any
law
that
says
that
you
have
to
be
a
nice
guy
in
your
private
business
dealings
you
go
on
to
say
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
if
so
so
what
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
preventing
parties
from
reaping
windfall
settlements
from
other
parties
when
those
settlements
arise
from
wrongful
acts
by
those
other
parties
if
atlantic
cement
didnt
want
to
have
to
face
a
choice
between
paying
a
windfall
settlement
or
going
out
of
business
well
shouldnt
atlantic
cement
have
thought
of
that
before
going
into
business
i
note
that
as
far
as
the
facts
show
boomer
et
al
were
not
the
parties
responsible
for
bringing
about
this
situation
that
was
atlantic
cements
own
fault
for
choosing
to
build
and
operate
the
type
of
plant
they
did
where
and
when
they
did
and
then
you
say
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
as
above
i
dispute
your
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
deprived
of
their
rights
as
owners
of
property
to
choose
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
property
at
a
price
acceptable
to
them
and
for
that
deprivation
they
were
not
made
whole
and
again
i
ask
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
avoided
if
so
ive
been
miseducated
i
always
thought
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
justice
is
done
is
boomer
really
being
taught
as
infamous
thats
really
sad
if
it
is
because
i
fail
to
see
how
its
less
than
completely
sensible
you
should
read
the
law
and
economics
stuff
firsthand
instead
of
filtered
through
teachers
who
clearly
dont
like
it
for
whatever
inexplicable
reasons
boomer
is
not
being
taught
as
infamous
at
least
not
at
my
school
aside
northeastern
law
usually
does
a
very
good
job
of
hiring
for
their
firstyear
mandatory
classes
such
as
torts
where
i
first
encountered
boomer
instructors
who
regardless
of
their
personal
opinions
can
and
do
teach
the
law
neutrally
when
the
students
get
into
their
second
and
third
years
in
which
the
students
a
can
pick
and
choose
which
courses
to
take
except
for
the
mandatory
professional
responsibility
of
course
and
b
are
presumed
to
be
a
bit
more
worldly
and
selfconfident
less
likely
to
be
consciously
or
subconsciously
intimidated
by
law
school
professors
and
able
to
learn
from
openly
biased
instructors
rather
than
be
indoctrinated
by
them
the
instructors
tend
to
be
more
open
in
expressing
their
own
opinions
this
is
especially
true
of
parttime
instructors
who
in
real
life
are
practicing
attorneys
or
sitting
judges
this
can
be
very
educational
sometimes
far
more
so
than
being
taught
by
a
somewhat
cloistered
scholar
end
of
aside
i
called
it
infamous
because
thats
my
opinion
of
it
for
the
reasons
ive
stated
above
i
believe
it
to
be
a
triumph
of
something
that
i
can
only
call
economic
correctness
over
justice
it
is
completely
sensible
only
if
you
believe
that
the
alleged
right
of
the
owners
of
atlantic
cement
to
stay
in
business
and
avoid
losing
a
lot
of
their
own
money
due
to
their
own
wrongful
act
and
the
alleged
right
of
several
hundred
atlantic
cement
employees
to
not
have
their
jobs
disappear
should
trump
the
rights
of
people
who
own
property
which
was
damaged
by
atlantic
cements
wrongful
acts
and
if
you
believe
that
it
is
correct
for
the
courts
or
any
other
branch
of
government
to
grant
to
private
parties
the
right
to
take
other
peoples
property
by
eminent
domain
youd
like
posner
bill
hes
a
libertarian
really
i
didnt
know
that
what
if
anything
has
he
had
to
say
about
cases
like
boomer
of
course
he
has
too
much
of
a
paper
trail
to
ever
be
nominated
by
a
president
democrat
wont
like
his
antitrust
stance
or
republican
wont
like
his
support
of
gay
marriage
and
if
bright
law
students
shiver
at
what
they
dont
understand
its
easy
to
imagine
how
the
press
will
play
it
up
as
babyselling
ive
seen
mike
godwin
claim
that
posner
asserts
that
law
and
economics
is
applicable
to
everything
and
is
the
endall
and
beall
when
posner
says
precisely
the
opposite
so
it
goes
ive
admitted
that
my
understanding
of
the
field
generally
referred
to
as
law
and
economics
is
weak
if
it
advocates
the
use
of
economical
analysis
as
one
of
many
tiebreaker
factors
which
courts
may
use
to
help
them
reach
decisions
in
cases
in
which
the
dispute
as
measured
by
the
scale
of
justice
is
evenly
balanced
fine
but
as
illustrated
by
boomer
it
is
not
fine
when
the
courts
start
viewing
the
economics
of
a
case
as
being
more
important
than
the
justice
of
a
case

in

mark
wilson
writes
on
the
news
last
night
clinton
was
bashing
the
republicans
for
stonewalling
his
so
called
stimulus
package
it
seems
that
one
small
item
within
this
package
was
going
to
pay
for
free
immunizations
for
poor
kids
so
now
clinton
is
claiming
that
the
republicans
are
holding
the
health
of
poor
kids
hostage
for
blatantly
political
gains
aside
from
the
merits
or
lack
thereof
of
another
free
immunization
program
just
what
is
such
a
program
doing
in
a
bill
that
is
supposedly
about
creating
jobs
jobs
what
the
hell
have
jobs
to
do
with
it
its
another
touchyfeely
program
from
the
new
vapid
administration
the
fact
is
the
major
claim
made
for
universal
immunization
that
all
children
will
be
immunized
has
absolutely
no
validity
several

already
have

programs
have
had
these

for
years
the
result
on
average
their
success
rates
are
no
better
than
the

it
seems
that

out

make

bring

in

another

shameless
demagoguery
from

the

if
clinton
is
so
hot
to
get
this
immunization

why
doesnt
he
and
the

just
introduce
it

bill
isnt
it

that
clinton

one
doing
the

pork
manipulations
here
he
is
telling

pass

package

tell

that
you
are

immunizing
poor

using

do
tell
i
have
never

of

but
stunts
like
this
lower
my
opinion
of
him
even
further
i
thought
one
of
clintons
campaign
themes
was
that
he
was
going
to
be
a

this

a

the

were
splashed
with
stories
of
proof
that
the
north
vietnamese
had
held
us
hostages
after
the
war
ended
way
back
in
todays
newspaper
page
of

there
is
an
article
about
the
document
that
held
the
proof
used
without
permission
the
document
which
was
discovered
in
the
archives
of
the
soviet
communist
party
in
moscow
is
a
russian
translation
of
what
is
described
as
a
september
report
prepared
for
the
vietnam
politburo
by
general
tran
van
quang
who
is
identified
as
the
deputy
chief
of
staff
of
the
north
vietnamese
army
later
on
in
the
article
after
it
talks
about
the
claim
of
americans
in
north
vietnamese
prisons
phong
said
the
easiest
way
to
prove
that
the
document
is
a
fabrication
is
to
review
quangs
career
in
he
said
quang
was
not
deputy
chief
of
staff
he
was
the
army
commander
in

the

it

follows
from
the
fact
that

automatically
with

oh
when
did

mother
nature
has

ever

we

it

it

itself
year
after

last

for

i
saw
four
deer
crossing
the
road
pretty
sight
too
in
an
earlier
time
one
of
them
would
have
been
dinner
there
are
ways
to
go
with
produced
things
the
first
is
to
trade
it
with
the
the
persons
who
produced
it
the
other
one
is
to
take
it
with
a
gun
from
the
person
who
produced
it
the
first
way
is
the
civilized
method
the
second
is
how
savages
arrange
their
affairs
the
american
indians
had
no
concept
of
ownership
of
property
and
often
freely
gave
of
their
supplies
to
neighboring
tribes
trading
food
and
clothing
for
weapons
or
services
the
native
hawaiians
like
their
polynesian
ancestors
also
could
not
conceive
of
that
idea
and
shared
many
things
with
the
other
islanders
in
fact
hiipoi
the
hawaiian
word
for
cherish
means
sharing
food
the
great
mahele
in
which
the
islands
were
divided
up
moreorless
evenly
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
was
a
white
mans
idea
in
africa
villagers
will
often
share
tools
crops
and
clothing
with
other
members
of
their
own
village
and
neighboring
villages
every
anthropologist
who
has
ever
been
to
africa
has
at
least
one
tale
of
the
difficulties
arising
from
the
so
called
theft
of
the
scientists
possessions
two
concepts
of
which
until

came

had
no

id
like
to
see
you

idiotic

seems
to
me
the

from

is
pretty
convincing
that
drug
legalization
is
a
good
idea
even
such
a
noted
conservative
as
william
f
buckley
supports
it
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
your
examples
except
for
prostitution
fail
miserably
to
meet
both
criteria
safer
and
cheaper
obviously
killing
people
is
not
safe
as
for
prostitution
why
shouldnt
it
be
legal

the

didnt
the

were

constitutions
for

free

had
some

not
all
the
rights
of

im
curious
if
there
was
an
additional
level
of
distinction
made
by
the
slave
states
to
rationalize
their
treatment
of
slaves
or
if
they
just
ignored
the
theoretical
problems
of
slave
ownership
the
bill
of
rights
as
far
as
i
can
see
does
not
once
refer
to
citizens
but
it
makes
several
references
to
people
for
example
article
iv
the
right

the

to

their

infamous

nor
shall
any

be

without

process
of

article
viii
excessive
bail
shall
not
be
required
nor
excessive
fines
imposed
nor
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
inflicted
now
ive
never
heard
that
constitutional
rights
apply
only
to
citizens
arent
they
meant
to
apply
equally
to
all
persons
living
in
the
us
whether
slaves
were
considered
not
human
i
dont
know
but
it
seems
that
a
case
could
be
made
that
they
werent
treated
as
people
as
defined
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
since
the
nation
is
nominally
based
on
the
declaration
of
independence
which
states
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
would
also
seem
that
slaves
would
not
follow
under
this
definition
of

that

asked
the

to
remove

all

without
sufficient
and
convincing

warrant
approval

the

only
a

hultman
reminded
the

the
fact

the

on

do
not
come
close
to
meeting
the
minimal

for

thomas

was
born
years

i
think
thats
appropriate
to
mention
at
the
beginning
of
this
meeting
because
since
that
time
he
has
been
of
course
a
person
who
has
been
one
that
weve
all
followed
in
terms
of
our
democracy
and
the
importance
of
education
here
in
this
great
country
the
success
of
our
democracy
according
to
jefferson
really
depends
upon
the
success
of
our
educational
system
i
wonder
if
he
realizes
the
irony
of
a
federal
secretary
invoking
a
rabid
antifederalist
in
support
of

you

no
but
ive

the

it
is
worrisome
to
me
but
not
to
you
ive
been
reading
capolitics
for
a
while
now
and
i
dont
recall
seeing
such
a
comparison
you
dont
read
my
postings
very
carefully
im
not
surprised
it
was
pretty
shocking
and
is
part
of
why
my
sympathy
though
not
agreement
with
the
prolifers
is
increasing
a
handful
of
lunatic
opinions
expressed
in
capolitics
does
not
make
me
think
that
the
opinion
is
widely
held
when
did
i
say
that
it
was
clayton
i
wish
i
knew
what
made
you
tick
your
math
sucks
and
you
take
single
instances
of
fringe
opinions
and
proclaim
the
existence
of
a
pernicious
trend
theres
about
a
quarter
billion
people
living
in
this
country
some
small
number
of
them
are
almost
guaranteed
to
hold
opinions
that
you
and
i
find
positively
repellent
as
long
as
the
small
number
is
truly
a
small
number
and
as
long
as
theyre
not
my
neighbor
highly
likely
im
not
worried
about
it
when
they
hold
high
public
office
you
should
worry
by
the
way
when
you
cite
experts
remember
that
carl
sagan

paul

are

too
if
ive
never

im

only
at

is

the
primary

many

in

system
dont

all
those
that
prefer
teaching
are
under
no
pressure
to
publish
when
discussing
and
issue
it
helps
that
all
participants
use
the
same
definitions
although
this
rarely
occurs
on
usenet
when
i
use
the
term
university
i
think
of
an
organization

number
one
goal
is

degrees
the

is

a

of

with
just
an

a
friend
had
an
instructor
who
didnt
have
a
degree
at
all
but
because
he
had
been
minister
of
culture
for
the
black
panthers
he
was
teaching
anyway
he
had
a
bad
habit
of
usually
not
showing
up
to
teach
the
class
and
finally
quit
in
disgust
at
the
racism
of
a
university
that
expected
him
to
show
up
to
teach
a
university

am
edt
the
president
thank
you
very
much
the
speech
that
octavius
gave
says
more
than
anything
i
will
be
able
to
say
today
about
why
its
important
to
give
all
of
our
young
people
a
chance
to
get
a
work
experience
and
to
continue
to
learn
to
merge
the
nature
of
learning
and
work
why
its
important
to
honor
the
efforts
of
people
like
jerry
levin
and
nancye
combs
and
pat
irving
and
all
of
those
who
are
here
i
want
to
thank
the
secretaries
of
labor
and
education
and
all
the
people
who
work
with
them
for
sponsoring
this
and
my
good
friend
governor
wilder
for
being
here
and
for
speaking
and
all
of
the
business
and
local
community
leaders
from
the
city
and
county
and
state
level
from
around
america
who
are
here
this
has
been
a
pretty
fun
day
laughter
i
loved
hearing
the
young
people
sing
it
was
music
to
my
ears
because
it
is
their
future
that
we
are
really
struggling
about
applause
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
began
the
quest
to
seek
the
presidency
because
i
was
concerned
about
their
future
because
i
believe
that
our
country
which
had
always
been
a
beacon
of
hope
for
the
young
had
too
little
opportunity
was
too
divided
among
ourselves
across
lines
of
income
and
race
and
region
and
other
ways
without
a
vision
to
take
us
into
the
future
i
entered
with
the
hope
that
together
we
could
create
more
opportunity
and
insist
on
much
more
responsibility
from
all
of
our
people
but
in
the
process
we
might
recreate
the
best
of
americas
community
knowing
that
together
we
could
always
to
more
than
we
could
individually
and
that
we
might
secure
our
future
all
of
you
here
today
are
committed
to
that
the
jobs
that
jerry
levin
has
committed
timewarner
to
is
symbolic
of
the
commitments
made
by
many
of
the
private
sector
people
who
are
here
and
those
who
are
around
the
country
the
work
that
nancye
combs
does
and
the
successes
of
all
the
young
people
like
those
on
this
stage
and
especially
the
eloquent
statement
octavius
jeffers
all
those
things
show
that
together
we
know
what
we
need
to
do
and
were
on
the
right
track
last
july
when
i
was
traveling
across
americas
heartland
in
my
luxurious
bus
i
visited
seneca
high
school
in
louisville
kentucky
and
there
i
met
young
people
and
business
people
who
were
participating
in
the
louisville
education
and
employment
partnership
i
saw
what
nancye
combs
talked
about
today
i
saw
how
the
young
people
were
making
an
extra
effort
to
succeed
both
in
school
and
at
work
i
saw
as
i
have
seen
many
times
in
my
own
state
the
principle
illustrated
that
octavius
has
talked
about
that
for
millions
of
american
young
people
it
is
really
an
impediment
to
both
their
learning
and
their
ability
to
be
good
workers
to
draw
a
sharp
dividing
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learning
in
the
world
in
which
we
are
living
the
average
young
person
will
change
the
nature
of
work
seven
or
eight
times
in
a
lifetime
we
must
learn
to
merge
the
work
world
and
the
learning
world
much
better
and
we
must
determine
that
all
of
our
young
people
see
the
opportunities
that
some
of
them
have
had
showcased
here
today
whether
youre
in
business
or
in
government
or
in
education
you
know
that
we
have
a
big
job
to
do
when
it
comes
to
building
a
future
that
really
honestly
includes
opportunity
for
all
of
our
people
there
are
still
a
lot
of
people
who
say
well
things
are
pretty
good
here
in
washington
and
everythings
fine
the
best
thing
we
can
do
about
this
whole
thing
is
nothing
they
all
have
jobs
laughter
all
the
people
who
say
that
applause
they
all
have
health
insurance
they
all
have
a
pretty
good
education
and
they
all
have
a
pretty
secure
knowledge
that
theyll
be
okay
no
matter
what
happens
i
say
that
not
to
be
either
political
or
unduly
critical
but
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
great
challenges
of
this
age
for
every
advanced
nation
everyone
is
to
fully
develop
the
capacities
of
all
of
its
people
and
then
find
work
for
them
to
do
all
the
european
countries
have
higher
unemployment
rates
than
we
do
but
also
stronger
support
systems
for
the
unemployed
the
japanese
unemployment
rate
has
been
going
up
theyre
going
to
adopt
a
stimulus
that
even
if
you
count
it
in
its
most
rigorous
terms
is
three
or
four
times
bigger
than
the
one
that
i
have
proposed
to
create
jobs
in
west
germany
alone
the
unemployment
rate
is
now
about
as
high
as
ours
this
is
a
big
problem
for
advanced
nations
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
add
an
extra
employee
with
a
lot
of
pressure
from
lowwage
producers
in
other
countries
that
are
growing
their
own
economies
and
trying
to
provide
new
opportunity
for
their
people
but
it
is
especially
important
for
america
for
two
reasons
one
is
we
have
a
whole
lot
of
folks
who
unless
we
move
aggressively
will
not
have
the
education
and
skills
we
need
to
be
competitive
and
productive
in
a
nation
like
this
the
second
is
even
if
we
educate
them
all
if
there
arent
jobs
they
will
be
robbed
of
the
fruits
of
their
educational
labors
people
need
to
be
able
to
work
in
this
country
applause
we
have
always
had
some
unemployment
and
indeed
some
of
it
is
normal
youve
always
got
some
people
leaving
jobs
and
moving
around
the
country
and
doing
first
one
thing
and
another
we
have
now
at
this
moment
in
our
history
the
necessity
for
all
big
organizations
including
the
government
to
reexamine
the
way
they
are
organized
and
who
ask
whether
there
are
too
many
people
working
at
some
kinds
of
jobs
but
in
the
whole
we
must
still
be
able
to
create
jobs
in
a
country
like
america
to
provide
people
with
the
chance
to
work
its
going
to
be
difficult
for
me
to
make
the
welfare
reform
proposals
that
i
will
make
to
congress
in
the
next
couple
of
months
its
going
to
be
hard
for
me
to
make
those
work
if
at
the
end
of
all
this
work
to
get
off
welfare
there
isnt
a
job
applause
so
we
have
two
tasks
one
is
to
develop
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
to
perform
without
regard
to
race
or
income
or
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
the
other
is
to
make
sure
that
there
are
some
opportunities
for
them
to
bring
to
bear
for
their
talent
and
to
be
rewarded
with
a
paycheck
it
is
a
great
challenge
i
do
not
pretend
that
all
of
the
answers
are
simple
but
i
know
if
you
want
to
ask
the
american
people
all
of
them
to
be
more
responsible
if
you
want
to
recreate
a
sense
of
community
in
this
country
that
bridges
the
lines
of
race
and
income
and
region
you
have
got
to
have
opportunity
in
that
mix
a
part
of
our
vision
for
america
has
to
be
a
future
for
every
young
person
in
this
country
whos
willing
to
play
by
the
rules
and
work
hard
and
strive
for
the
end
of
the
rainbow
there
has
to
be
something
at
the
end
of
that
rainbow
and
that
is
what
we
are
basically
here
to
talk
about
today
what
can
we
all
do
as
partners
recognizing
none
of
us
can
do
it
alone
to
develop
the
capacities
of
our
people
to
succeed
wherever
they
live
and
whatever
their
background
and
then
what
can
we
do
to
make
sure
that
theres
something
there
for
them
to
do
the
summer
jobs
program
were
discussing
today
is
an
integral
part
of
that
plan
because
it
will
promote
the
values
of
work
and
opportunity
and
fairness
community
it
will
put
the
people
first
and
it
does
have
a
partnership
between
the
public
and
private
sector
i
said
when
i
addressed
the
united
states
congress
in
february
on
this
program
that
i
would
seek
to
create
about
extra
summer
jobs
from
government
sources
and
then
challenge
the
american
business
community
to
meet
that
target
so
that
we
can
create
more
than
a
million
new
summer
jobs
over
and
above
what
had
been
created
before
many
many
people
have
responded
to
that
challenge
and
jerry
is
just
a
shining
example
of
that
which
has
been
replicated
in
this
room
and
around
the
country
people
who
are
going
to
do
more
than
they
otherwise
would
in
the
private
sector
to
give
young
people
a
work
experience
and
it
is
terribly
important
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
summer
jobs
program
is
part
of
an
overall
commitment
to
increase
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
from
retraining
defense
workers
who
lose
their
jobs
and
other
adults
who
need
to
acquire
new
skills
to
improving
the
transition
from
school
to
work
for
young
people
who
dont
go
to
college
but
do
need
at
least
two
years
of
posthigh
school
training
either
on
the
job
or
in
a
community
college
or
a
vocational
setting
so
that
they
can
be
competitive
workers
making
it
possible
for
more
people
to
go
on
to
college
who
do
want
to
go
all
these
things
are
part
and
parcel
of
a
comprehensive
plan
its
also
important
as
i
said
that
we
create
more
jobs
the
emergency
jobs
program
that
i
asked
the
congress
to
adopt
would
create
a
half
a
million
extra
jobs
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
and
that
would
reduce
the
unemployment
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
it
would
also
enable
us
to
absorb
more
young
people
coming
into
the
work
force
in
jobs
that
otherwise
will
not
be
created
it
also
will
help
a
lot
of
cities
and
counties
to
invest
in
things
that
need
to
be
done
at
the
grassroots
level
projects
long
delayed
water
projects
sewer
projects
park
projects
new
industries
and
particularly
in
small
and
mediumsize
communities
a
whole
range
of
things
that
will
improve
the
economy
and
improve
the
environment
the
summer
jobs
program
is
an
important
part
of
that
because
we
have
tried
for
the
first
time
through
the
work
of
the
labor
department
and
the
education
department
and
through
reaching
out
to
people
like
you
to
make
this
more
than
just
a
oneshot
summer
jobs
program
to
integrate
it
with
private
sector
efforts
to
hopefully
replicate
it
in
each
coming
summer
to
move
these
young
people
into
further
educational
opportunities
and
to
further
job
opportunities
and
to
have
a
strong
meaningful
education
component
to
these
summer
jobs
something
that
the
united
states
government
has
never
fully
emphasized
before
a
lot
of
these
young
people
as
you
well
know
because
they
come
from
difficult
backgrounds
because
they
go
to
school
in
difficult
and
challenging
circumstances
need
extra
help
in
building
their
basic
skills
in
math
and
language
reasoning
and
in
other
areas
and
a
lot
of
educational
studies
show
that
young
people
who
have
difficulty
in
school
often
forget
as
much
as
percent
of
what
they
learn
over
the
summer
and
then
that
has
to
be
repeated
the
next
year
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
give
people
the
opportunity
to
learn
good
work
habits
and
to
reinforce
their
learning
skills
and
to
put
them
together
and
then
hopefully
over
the
next
couple
of
years
if
our
entire
program
passes
to
give
every
school
in
this
country
the
opportunity
to
have
a
good
work
and
learning
environment
there
will
be
more
applied
academics
more
opportunities
for
people
to
learn
and
work
during
the
school
year
so
that
this
will
not
simply
be
an
isolated
moment
for
these
young
folks
but
will
be
a
part
of
building
a
whole
new
educational
experience
a
whole
new
work
experience
and
moving
on
a
pathway
to
a
better
future
the
summer
jobs
programs
are
not
designed
to
be
make
work
jobs
theyre
designed
to
make
a
future
for
the
people
holding
the
job
and
thats
what
they
will
do
in
the
process
theyll
help
to
build
local
communities
to
strengthen
local
economies
to
solve
local
problems
real
jobs
renovating
housing
repairing
public
buildings
doing
clerical
work
providing
nursing
assistance
in
hospitals
supervising
and
training
children
at
child
care
centers
and
learning
all
the
way
challenging
young
people
to
learn
while
they
earn
but
letting
them
earn
you
know
its
very
difficult
to
make
a
case
to
people
who
have
never
seen
opportunity
on
their
own
street
that
they
should
do
this
that
or
the
other
thing
if
theres
no
evidence
of
the
opportunity
thats
at
the
end
of
the
effort
i
have
not
been
sparing
in
going
for
the
last
yearandahalf
into
places
where
it
isnt
exactly
popular
to
say
it
and
say
i
wanted
to
reform
the
welfare
system
i
wanted
to
toughen
child
support
i
wanted
to
require
people
to
work
i
was
sick
and
tired
of
people
being
irresponsible
in
the
use
of
guns
on
the
streets
and
i
wanted
to
change
all
that
but
if
youre
going
to
summon
people
to
greater
responsibility
you
have
to
reward
them
when
they
do
the
right
thing
with
opportunity
applause
the
young
people
we
propose
to
put
to
work
under
our
program
will
spend
hours
learning
basic
skills
such
as
math
reading
writing
either
on
the
job
in
the
classroom
they
will
stretch
their
minds
as
well
as
work
up
a
sweat
they
will
have
a
sense
of
accomplishment
it
will
literally
be
a
summer
challenge
but
a
challenge
that
will
take
them
into
a
different
life
so
i
want
to
ask
all
of
you
to
support
this
effort
even
as
i
as
your
president
support
your
effort
at
the
end
of
the
summer
we
will
evaluate
all
the
young
people
who
participate
well
see
whether
they
instead
of
falling
behind
over
the
summer
academically
as
too
many
young
people
do
they
stayed
even
or
moved
ahead
i
suspect
that
they
will
this
summer
secretary
reich
and
secretary
riley
and
i
will
be
visiting
many
of
your
communities
well
really
try
to
learn
from
you
which
of
these
efforts
are
working
what
we
should
do
next
summer
how
we
can
build
it
in
to
what
goes
on
during
the
school
year
how
we
can
build
in
our
job
training
efforts
and
the
works
that
we
do
with
your
companies
to
make
sense
of
this
whole
thing
so
that
we
maximize
the
impact
of
the
taxpayer
dollar
and
your
private
investments
as
well
we
want
to
honor
the
companies
and
the
communities
the
business
leaders
and
the
young
people
who
do
the
very
best
jobs
this
summer
and
again
i
want
to
say
to
all
of
you
in
private
business
who
have
matched
our
effort
i
thank
you
and
to
all
of
you
who
havent
and
those
across
the
country
who
may
listen
or
learn
about
this
event
today
i
want
to
implore
other
private
employers
to
stretch
a
little
bit
to
give
other
young
people
a
chance
to
work
this
summer
im
telling
you
we
cannot
go
through
another
years
when
we
dont
give
these
children
anything
to
say
yes
to
if
we
exhort
them
to
do
right
weve
got
to
be
able
to
reward
them
applause
when
the
other
speakers
were
talking
i
was
sitting
up
here
on
the
platform
listening
and
reveling
and
they
got
talking
about
work
and
i
got
to
thinking
about
all
the
different
things
ive
done
to
make
a
living
in
my
life
when
i
was
i
made
a
very
foolish
shortterm
business
investment
i
set
up
a
comic
book
stand
and
sold
two
trunks
full
of
comic
books
made
more
money
than
i
had
ever
had
in
my
life
but
if
i
had
saved
those
trunks
theyd
be
worth
today
laughter
that
does
not
mean
young
people
should
not
be
entrepreneurial
it
just
means
that
you
cant
foresee
a
generation
ahead
i
have
mowed
yards
and
cleared
land
and
built
houses
and
worked
in
body
shops
and
the
parts
departments
of
a
car
dealership
and
ive
done
a
lot
of
different
things
for
a
living
some
people
say
i
got
into
politics
to
escape
work
laughter
i
learned
something
from
every
job
i
ever
had
but
i
grew
up
in
a
generation
where
i
literally
did
not
know
a
living
soul
without
regard
to
race
or
income
who
wanted
to
work
who
didnt
have
a
job
i
grew
up
in
a
generation
when
all
you
had
to
really
say
to
people
is
get
an
education
and
youll
be
all
right
youll
get
a
job
and
youll
make
more
money
next
year
than
you
did
this
year
now
i
live
in
a
generation
full
of
people
most
of
whom
dont
make
any
more
money
in
real
dollars
than
they
did
years
ago
and
theyre
working
longer
hours
and
theyre
paying
more
for
the
basics
of
life
and
we
are
now
wondering
whether
we
can
create
the
jobs
that
these
young
people
want
now
i
want
to
close
by
reemphasizing
these
two
things
it
doesnt
matter
what
kind
of
economic
policies
this
administration
pursues
or
how
much
productivity
increases
there
are
in
the
private
sector
if
young
americans
dont
get
a
good
education
dont
learn
how
to
work
and
cant
be
productive
those
jobs
will
not
be
created
in
this
country
machines
will
do
the
work
or
the
work
will
be
done
offshore
by
people
who
have
the
same
skill
levels
and
can
work
for
a
third
or
a
fourth
or
a
fifth
the
wages
so
nothing
we
can
do
economically
will
matter
unless
we
build
the
skills
and
capacities
of
americas
work
force
and
anybody
that
pretends
otherwise
is
just
kidding
on
the
other
hand
we
need
to
be
honest
every
wealthy
country
in
the
world
including
the
united
states
is
having
difficulty
creating
jobs
if
i
knew
everything
that
needs
to
be
done
id
be
glad
to
tell
you
and
we
could
just
call
off
the
whole
deliberations
of
congress
and
everything
else
i
dont
have
all
the
answers
but
i
know
this
doing
nothing
is
not
the
answer
applause
and
so
the
jobs
program
that
i
have
presented
to
congress
with
the
summer
jobs
with
the
money
for
the
cities
and
the
counties
through
the
community
development
program
with
the
infrastructure
money
is
a
small
part
of
a
big
budget
it
is
an
attempt
to
engage
in
an
experiment
to
see
whether
or
not
with
the
economy
recovering
in
terms
of
corporate
profit
we
can
give
a
little
boost
to
it
give
opportunities
to
young
people
create
a
half
a
million
jobs
and
maybe
get
the
engine
going
again
most
of
the
jobs
in
this
program
are
going
to
be
jobs
in
the
private
sector
not
government
jobs
even
though
its
government
money
and
the
lions
share
of
the
work
in
rebuilding
the
american
economy
obviously
will
come
from
the
private
sector
thats
the
kind
of
system
we
have
and
it
works
pretty
well
but
this
is
the
challenge
we
have
so
i
ask
all
of
you
here
today
to
support
the
summer
jobs
program
to
ask
your
friends
and
neighbors
to
support
it
to
go
back
home
and
ask
your
employers
to
make
a
little
extra
effort
to
do
what
you
can
to
help
me
pass
the
funds
to
create
the
jobs
that
the
united
states
government
should
create
this
summer
so
that
together
we
can
have
this
partnership
because
more
than
anything
else
we
have
to
give
a
future
a
future
that
our
young
people
can
believe
in
we
need
to
send
them
a
message
that
here
in
america
if
you
study
hard
and
work
hard
if
you
obey
the
law
and
contribute
something
to
your
community
you
will
be
rewarded
by
your
country
you
can
build
a
future
from
you
own
dreams
that
has
always
been
the
promise
of
america
together
thats
what
this
summer
of
challenge
needs
to
be
a
reaffirmation
of
the
promise
of
america
for
so
many
young
people
to
whom
that
promise
has
been
an
illusion
we
can
make
it
a
reality
thank
you
very
much
applause

the
white
house
office
of
the
press
secretary
for
immediate
release
april
press
briefing
by
george
stephanopoulos
the
briefing
room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
just
prepared
to
take
questions
today
q
george
bob
dole
says
that
the
clinton
administrations
policy
on
bosnia
is
a
failure
and
that
he
wants
the
united
states
to
take
the
lead
in
lifting
the
arms
embargo
so
that
the
bosnian
muslims
can
defend
themselves
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
president
clinton
has
said
that
that
suggestion
is
under
active
consideration
obviously
this
is
a
tragic
situation
in
bosnia
and
if
the
bosnian
serbs
dont
come
to
the
negotiating
table
in
a
constructive
way
well
look
seriously
at
pressing
for
lifting
the
arms
embargo
in
the
meantime
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
a
tough
sanctions
resolution
in
the
un
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
but
the
prospect
of
an
arms
embargo
is
something
the
president
certainly
will
consider
if
the
serbs
dont
come
to
the
table
q
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
give
them
to
come
to
the
table
george
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
that
right
now
q
its
been
a
long
time
q
on
february
the
president
mentioned
the
value
added
tax
in
ohio
and
when
he
was
asked
about
it
later
by
reporters
he
said
quote
that
is
a
radical
change
in
the
tax
system
of
the
united
states
its
something
i
think
we
may
have
to
look
at
in
the
years
ahead
questioned
again
about
it
later
he
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
it
wasnt
a
trial
balloon
or
anything
he
said
i
was
just
discussing
the
tax
response
to
a
question
donna
shalala
quoted
in
usa
today
this
morning
quote
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
whats
gone
on
q
the
same
with
alice
rivlin
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
the
health
care
task
force
is
reviewing
a
number
of
options
they
havent
made
any
decisions
yet
and
as
i
have
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
were
not
going
to
comment
on
decisions
that
havent
been
made
q
but
you
have
also
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
q
wait
a
minute
whoa
nelly
whoa
q
that
that
was
not
under
consideration
q
yes
clinton
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
is
that
no
longer
true
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
the
working
group
as
ms
shalala
says
has
looked
at
this
prospect
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
of
any
kind
q
well
i
know
but
he
said
hed
tell
us
about
it
if
it
was
ever
under
consideration
i
take
it
that
now
he
is
and
he
didnt
tell
us
about
it
or
mr
stephanopoulos
did
he
say
if
it
was
under
consideration
or
if
it
was
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
ill
tell
you
mr
stephanopoulos
if
its
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
thats
a
direct
quote
mr
stephanopoulos
the
task
force
has
looked
at
a
number
of
different
options
they
have
not
made
any
decisions
yet
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
yet
this
is
one
of
the
proposals
under
consideration
by
the
task
force
was
to
go
out
and
cast
as
wide
a
net
as
possible
for
different
ideas
on
how
to
reform
the
health
care
system
they
have
cast
a
very
wide
net
they
have
looked
at
hundreds
of
different
proposals
probably
thousands
of
different
proposals
but
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
q
well
is
the
president
aware
of
their
consideration
of
this
option
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
hes
been
briefed
on
any
preliminary
conclusions
or
anything
like
that
from
the
task
force
on
this
specific
proposal
of
any
kind
i
dont
know
that
thats
gotten
to
his
level
he
started
yesterday
to
go
through
with
the
task
force
a
very
wide
range
of
decisions
and
i
dont
believe
that
thats
been
presented
to
him
no
q
well
hes
not
relying
on
the
usa
today
to
tell
him
what
his
task
force
is
considering
in
the
way
of
taxes
mr
stephanopoulos
no
hes
going
through
it
in
a
very
deliberate
fashion
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
i
dont
know
that
this
proposal
has
reached
that
decision
making
point
q
if
this
is
still
under
consideration
thats
a
change
at
least
from
what
weve
been
told
by
dee
dee
i
think
about
three
weeks
ago
or
so
she
said
that
is
not
an
option
talking
about
the
had
a
big
argument
with
somebody
over
this
so
i
remember
it
specifically
and
said
it
not
once
but
twice
is
that
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
if
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
something
that
is
being
looked
at
at
some
level
in
the
task
force
q
it
was
ruled
it
out
though
i
mean
unlike
other
options
that
youve
kept
in
the
mix
this
one
specifically
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
again
this
is
something
that
is
being
looked
at
but
no
decision
has
been
made
of
any
kind
i
mean
it
doesnt
its
not
necessarily
material
until
you
get
to
the
decisionmaking
phase
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
hundreds
of
different
options
q
if
it
was
ruled
out
before
and
its
not
ruled
out
now
then
something
has
changed
george
yes
no
q
when
a
guy
says
in
february
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
the
widest
possible
range
of
options
q
so
somethings
changed
they
werent
looking
at
it
before
theyre
looking
at
it
now
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
if
the
working
groups
have
gotten
to
that
point
yet
they
are
casting
a
very
wide
net
q
how
was
it
possible
that
you
and
dee
dee
were
able
to
sell
definitively
rule
it
out
as
an
option
previously
and
now
are
saying
that
in
fact
it
is
being
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
a
wide
range
of
options
they
have
not
q
do
you
deny
that
you
and
dee
dee
ruled
it
flatly
ruled
it
out
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
month
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
deny
that
i
mean
those
are
the
presidents
words
those
are
very
clear
q
subsequent
to
the
presidents
words
do
you
deny
that
within
the
last
month
you
and
dee
dee
have
both
publicly
ruled
it
out
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
the
timing
i
think
what
we
did
was
refer
back
to
the
presidents
words
and
say
they
stand
q
so
dont
they
stand
any
longer
q
march
clinton
said
for
the
next
four
to
five
years
it
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
well
those
words
the
president
did
say
that
in
february
the
working
groups
are
on
a
separate
track
and
as
i
said
i
dont
believe
q
separate
from
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
q
are
they
considering
something
that
the
president
q
has
ruled
out
q
has
ruled
out
i
mean
will
the
president
consider
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
have
not
presented
this
to
the
president
they
have
looked
at
a
wide
range
of
options
i
suppose
that
if
an
argument
is
made
he
will
clearly
listen
to
it
that
does
not
mean
he
has
decided
to
do
it
q
can
we
put
this
another
way
in
his
answer
in
ohio
he
looked
at
the
vat
in
terms
of
restructuring
the
whole
tax
system
under
those
that
was
the
circumstance
that
he
said
it
might
be
considered
at
some
future
point
is
that
no
longer
the
case
or
is
that
the
only
way
that
he
can
see
a
vat
emerging
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
not
sure
exactly
what
youre
asking
q
he
talked
about
the
vat
in
the
context
of
a
restructured
tax
system
not
as
a
specific
way
to
finance
health
care
for
example
q
or
anything
else
q
or
anything
else
q
it
was
always
in
the
context
of
substituting
for
other
taxes
at
a
time
of
a
dramatic
overhaul
of
the
whole
tax
system
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
has
that
change
too
q
is
that
still
his
view
mr
stephanopoulos
i
havent
spoken
about
those
specific
comments
i
think
i
can
just
go
back
to
it
are
the
working
groups
have
they
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
yes
they
have
q
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
they
have
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
has
it
been
presented
to
the
president
has
he
made
a
decision
no
he
has
not
q
what
kind
of
a
deal
do
you
have
when
youve
got
the
presidents
appointed
task
force
obviously
not
oblivious
to
his
ruling
something
out
except
in
the
context
of
some
huge
down
the
line
reform
goes
ahead
on
its
own
and
considers
a
tax
which
he
has
specifically
ruled
out
in
any
context
other
than
much
later
and
then
goes
ahead
and
announces
that
thats
what
theyre
looking
at
is
the
president
concerned
about
that
sort
of
thing
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
the
presidents
concern
is
to
make
sure
he
gets
the
best
health
care
proposal
possible
hes
concerned
with
making
sure
that
they
have
the
most
thorough
process
for
examining
all
the
possible
alternatives
all
the
different
alternatives
if
a
decision
is
made
to
go
forward
with
something
like
that
its
certainly
something
the
president
will
explain
and
justify
but
no
decision
has
been
made
along
those
lines
q
what
does
it
mean
exactly
though
when
the
president
rules
something
out
does
it
mean
it
can
get
back
on
the
table
later
if
a
more
persuasive
argument
is
made
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
thats
indisputably
true
if
you
but
at
the
same
time
he
has
not
ruled
it
in
he
has
not
made
a
proposal
q
what
makes
him
open
to
it
now
when
he
wasnt
open
to
it
before
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
certainly
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
q
was
he
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
for
a
shortterm
tax
this
year
and
he
wasnt
willing
to
listen
to
it
in
chilicothe
hes
now
open
to
it
mr
stephanopoulos
the
context
of
his
comments
was
that
it
was
not
something
he
wanted
to
be
clear
that
this
is
not
something
he
was
proposing
not
something
he
was
floating
q
not
something
he
was
considering
those
are
his
words
its
not
something
thats
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
youre
now
acknowledging
are
you
not
that
it
is
under
consideration
and
mr
stephanopoulos
im
acknowledging
that
the
task
force
has
studied
this
proposal
i
am
also
stating
that
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
on
it
q
but
the
door
is
open
for
the
president
to
reconsider
including
this
as
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
obviously
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
again
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
do
you
know
if
they
will
make
a
presentation
on
behalf
of
the
vat
to
him
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
i
assume
that
if
i
dont
know
what
stage
they
are
it
in
proposing
i
dont
know
that
theyre
going
to
make
the
conclusion
that
this
is
something
they
should
present
to
him
i
know
this
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
q
do
you
understand
george
that
none
of
us
are
asking
these
questions
in
context
of
a
decision
that
the
president
has
made
only
about
what
the
president
is
considering
mr
stephanopoulos
i
understand
that
and
i
am
acknowledging
that
the
working
groups
have
examined
the
issue
of
a
vat
q
and
the
president
will
consider
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
assume
that
he
will
consider
the
argument
if
it
is
presented
to
him
q
does
that
mean
the
president
that
working
groups
think
that
when
the
president
says
no
he
means
maybe
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
means
that
the
working
groups
are
trying
to
do
the
most
thorough
job
possible
q
george
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
laughter
q
no
he
wants
us
to
stay
on
this
q
lets
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
q
no
he
got
out
of
that
swamp
q
i
think
weve
gotten
the
bottom
line
on
that
vat
reggie
bartholomew
your
special
ambassador
in
belgrade
today
said
that
if
the
serbs
do
not
accept
the
agreement
that
has
been
worked
out
quote
we
will
do
our
part
to
pursue
the
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
together
with
our
allies
that
seems
to
go
a
bit
further
than
what
youve
just
said
mr
stephanopoulos
sounds
almost
exactly
what
i
just
said
q
well
do
you
accept
in
other
words
you
accept
what
reggie
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
has
said
that
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
it
is
something
he
will
consider
if
the
current
actions
dont
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
q
isnt
there
some
kind
of
timetable
here
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
there
is
a
timetable
theres
going
to
be
a
vote
on
the
un
resolution
in
about
days
q
thats
on
sanctions
thats
on
tightening
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
right
thats
sanctions
and
we
believe
that
that
will
ratchet
up
the
pressure
and
we
hope
that
that
will
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
as
you
know
mr
bartholomew
also
met
with
mr
churkin
of
russia
and
they
are
also
working
on
ways
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
continue
to
pressure
them
in
many
different
ways
and
this
is
one
possible
option
as
well
q
the
question
is
whether
theres
a
timetable
for
consideration
or
a
vote
on
a
decision
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
not
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
the
next
vote
in
the
un
is
on
sanctions
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
no
votes
scheduled
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
but
it
is
something
that
we
have
discussed
both
internally
and
with
our
allies
q
why
did
reggie
bartholomew
tell
the
serbs
that
the
us
would
do
that
what
was
the
point
of
his
telling
them
that
mr
stephanopoulos
well
clearly
i
mean
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
and
this
is
something
that
we
take
quite
seriously
if
they
do
not
come
to
the
table
they
should
know
the
consequences
of
failing
to
come
to
the
table
q
have
they
been
given
a
deadline
q
warren
christopher
has
been
saying
the
same
thing
and
it
hasnt
seemed
to
change
the
serbs
behavior
in
the
least
why
should
the
serbs
take
any
heed
of
a
threat
to
lift
the
arms
embargo
when
so
far
everything
thats
been
done
has
had
no
effect
on
the
fighting
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
accept
the
premise
of
your
question
it
has
had
an
effect
the
embargo
is
having
an
effect
q
what
effect
mr
stephanopoulos
if
the
serbians
choose
not
to
heed
our
warnings
then
they
will
face
the
consequences
q
what
effect
has
it
had
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
effect
that
it
has
had
on
the
serbians
it
has
tightened
up
they
are
not
getting
their
shipments
through
we
can
brief
more
fully
q
in
bosnia
george
in
bosnia
what
effect
has
it
had
mr
stephanopoulos
well
its
hard
to
say
if
its
stopped
the
aggression
to
date
that
is
why
were
continuing
to
press
for
the
serbians
to
stop
but
we
believe
that
over
time
we
will
continue
to
weaken
the
serbs
and
that
will
have
an
effect
im
not
saying
its
going
to
happen
overnight
it
clearly
hasnt
happened
overnight
but
we
believe
that
over
time
the
sanctions
can
weaken
the
serbs
if
it
fails
to
work
and
if
the
serbs
fail
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
well
move
forward
with
the
embargo
q
isnt
there
a
working
deadline
george
of
the
the
same
date
as
the
un
the
scheduled
un
vote
hasnt
the
united
states
said
along
with
many
of
the
other
nato
allies
that
if
the
serbs
arent
willing
to
sign
on
to
the
peace
accord
by
then
that
well
seek
havent
we
said
that
we
will
seek
mr
stephanopoulos
weve
said
continually
were
going
to
q
but
on
that
deadline
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
a
specific
date
but
were
going
to
move
forward
with
the
resolution
the
un
resolution
by
around
that
time
and
if
that
fails
to
take
effect
if
that
fails
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
clearly
consider
other
actions
q
isnt
this
awfully
incremental
mr
stephanopoulos
were
taking
a
stepbystep
approach
were
ratcheting
up
the
pressure
and
were
going
to
continue
to
do
that
q
is
there
a
possibility
george
that
by
the
time
all
these
incremental
steps
are
taken
the
serbs
will
have
achieved
their
goals
and
then
whats
the
purpose
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
we
are
pursuing
that
goal
on
many
different
fronts
we
are
pursuing
it
through
the
un
were
pursuing
it
through
direct
talks
we
are
pursuing
it
through
tightening
the
sanctions
and
we
will
consider
lifting
the
arms
embargo
we
are
turning
the
screws
up
on
the
serbs
and
we
will
continue
to
do
that
q
but
if
the
efforts
have
been
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
how
effective
will
any
campaign
be
to
have
the
serbs
give
back
what
theyve
gained
i
mean
once
theyre
entrenched
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
speculate
on
that
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
them
to
come
to
the
table
now
were
going
to
continue
to
find
ways
to
stop
the
aggression
but
i
cant
see
into
the
future
q
george
on
the
stimulus
package
house
republicans
say
theyre
going
to
hold
a
series
of
town
meetings
on
saturday
to
try
and
explain
the
details
of
your
package
they
cite
polls
which
show
that
the
more
people
learn
about
it
the
less
they
like
it
whats
your
strategy
to
counter
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
strategy
we
have
is
the
one
were
going
to
continue
as
you
saw
the
president
today
pointed
up
the
very
real
benefits
of
the
summer
jobs
program
that
this
package
will
provide
new
summer
jobs
this
summer
for
kids
in
inner
cities
and
suburbs
to
do
productive
work
we
are
also
going
to
point
out
the
benefits
of
the
highway
money
the
investments
in
highways
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
immunization
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
head
start
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
republicans
have
a
choice
they
can
take
action
to
create
jobs
or
they
can
perpetuate
the
gridlock
of
the
last
four
years
q
does
it
concern
you
though
that
the
house
now
the
house
republicans
are
after
you
as
well
as
the
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
the
house
republicans
voted
against
it
before
they
made
a
mistake
then
theyre
making
a
mistake
now
q
george
does
it
strike
anybody
in
the
administration
that
its
a
bit
strong
to
describe
as
the
president
did
this
morning
the
summer
jobs
program
as
quote
a
reaffirmation
of
a
promise
of
america
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
think
its
the
promise
of
america
to
give
kids
a
chance
to
reach
their
full
potential
q
governmentfunded
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
to
give
people
a
chance
to
work
absolutely
that
is
the
promise
of
america
q
i
want
to
follow
up
on
something
i
asked
yesterday
where
does
summer
jobs
where
does
that
figure
come
from
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
on
top
of
i
did
look
at
it
there
are
currently
summer
jobs
in
the
pipeline
this
will
be
on
top
of
the
so
it
will
be
a
total
of
million
q
the
would
be
created
by
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
where
does
that
number
come
from
because
weve
been
told
all
along
that
the
stimulus
package
would
create
new
jobs
and
according
to
panetta
that
breaks
down
to
something
like
fulltime
jobs
and
summer
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
but
the
summer
thats
when
you
do
their
fulltime
equivalence
i
mean
individuals
will
receive
jobs
this
summer
when
you
calculate
it
for
the
fulltime
job
effect
you
have
to
do
i
dont
know
what
the
exact
formula
is
q
seven
hundred
thousand
parttime
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
or
q
one
to
four
because
its
three
months
mr
stephanopoulos
thank
you
q
can
i
follow
up
on
that
did
the
president
misspeak
this
morning
when
he
said
that
some
of
the
government
money
for
these
summer
jobs
will
pay
for
private
for
kids
to
work
in
the
private
sector
mr
stephanopoulos
not
necessarily
i
mean
i
think
that
there
will
be
grants
available
thats
one
of
the
ways
that
you
pay
for
the
jobs
at
the
same
time
hes
also
issued
a
challenge
to
the
private
sector
to
hire
kids
on
their
own
as
well
q
tax
dollars
for
instance
would
pay
for
kids
to
work
at
timewarner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
timewarner
is
actually
somebody
coming
forward
and
actually
doing
a
grant
thats
going
to
be
the
bulk
of
it
there
could
be
isolated
instances
though
where
there
would
be
grants
to
businesses
q
has
the
president
spoken
with
any
senate
republicans
this
week
mr
stephanopoulos
no
but
theres
been
a
lot
of
contact
with
senate
republicans
in
the
white
house
q
at
a
lower
level
but
the
president
hasnt
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
not
no
q
getting
any
closer
to
get
the
votes
mr
stephanopoulos
were
continuing
to
work
on
it
q
anybody
leaning
your
way
q
on
haiti
the
new
york
times
seems
to
be
reporting
something
of
a
breakthrough
in
aristides
attitude
towards
the
coup
leaders
can
you
confirm
that
there
has
been
this
change
and
what
impact
will
it
have
on
the
process
and
what
did
pezzullo
have
to
say
yesterday
in
his
report
mr
stephanopoulos
pezzullo
did
brief
the
principals
i
cant
confirm
whats
actually
happening
in
the
talks
i
would
leave
that
to
the
negotiators
themselves
but
mr
caputo
has
returned
to
haiti
we
have
received
a
briefing
here
at
the
white
house
from
ambassador
pezzullo
and
as
we
have
said
time
and
time
again
we
believe
that
assurances
of
security
are
important
to
a
final
resolution
to
a
broader
political
settlement
q
george
yesterday
you
offered
some
selective
breakdowns
of
how
the
stimulus
would
impact
some
states
and
cities
can
we
get
a
complete
breakdown
by
state
of
how
these
jobs
would
be
impacted
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
have
it
for
most
states
yes
and
i
think
we
can
get
it
out
q
could
you
make
that
generally
available
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
we
can
q
and
could
you
do
it
by
the
component
of
the
stimulus
in
other
words
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
we
can
do
i
know
that
we
can
do
it
by
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
i
dont
know
how
deeply
it
can
be
broken
down
but
clearly
we
can
break
it
down
into
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
q
and
can
i
follow
up
is
this
the
information
that
jeff
eller
and
the
rest
of
the
white
house
is
using
in
the
ads
in
the
states
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyre
ads
but
theyre
press
releases
q
can
you
describe
what
those
press
releases
contain
mr
stephanopoulos
all
were
doing
is
pointing
out
the
benefits
of
this
package
to
various
states
for
instance
i
know
that
today
senator
dole
is
heading
up
to
vermont
and
new
hampshire
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
stimulus
package
the
jobs
package
creates
jobs
in
vermont
it
creates
jobs
in
new
hampshire
and
the
people
of
those
states
should
remind
him
that
this
is
important
q
where
are
the
releases
going
mr
stephanopoulos
they
go
to
the
states
q
to
whom
mr
stephanopoulos
we
can
get
them
its
no
problem
q
can
we
get
it
q
why
dont
you
put
them
out
here
as
well
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
can
q
this
afternoon
would
that
be
possible
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
check
i
dont
know
but
as
soon
as
we
can
q
are
you
focusing
these
press
releases
on
states
where
there
are
moderate
or
pragmatic
republican
senators
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
were
trying
to
get
as
many
as
we
can
its
actually
quite
difficult
to
pull
this
together
and
were
doing
our
best
were
putting
them
out
as
we
get
them
q
why
are
you
so
closely
tracking
senator
doles
schedule
mr
stephanopoulos
i
was
just
following
it
q
are
press
releases
going
along
to
states
where
hes
visiting
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
i
think
that
probably
there
are
press
releases
going
to
vermont
laughter
q
will
there
be
a
man
in
a
chicken
suit
waiting
laughter
q
george
as
the
president
goes
about
the
business
of
defending
whats
in
his
stimulus
package
he
doesnt
address
what
seems
to
be
the
republicans
main
point
that
youre
funding
it
with
deficit
spending
rather
than
if
its
so
important
why
not
come
up
with
the
funding
for
it
seems
to
be
the
republican
argument
and
how
do
you
answer
that
mr
stephanopoulos
what
was
answer
is
we
are
paying
for
it
over
time
and
if
you
look
at
our
budget
we
pay
for
this
package
over
time
we
believe
right
now
the
economy
needs
a
jump
start
for
jobs
q
youre
not
claiming
are
you
that
that
doesnt
add
to
the
deficit
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
im
saying
were
paying
for
it
over
time
i
didnt
say
that
q
i
know
that
george
but
i
mean
from
the
beginning
the
question
we
do
have
annual
budgets
and
things
deficit
spending
will
pay
for
that
this
year
will
it
not
mr
stephanopoulos
this
year
they
clearly
will
but
over
time
our
budget
fully
pays
for
this
program
q
what
youre
saying
is
that
there
are
savings
that
would
cover
this
if
it
were
this
year
in
future
years
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
thats
exactly
what
i
said
q
i
know
that
but
there
is
going
to
be
outstanding
debt
it
will
add
to
the
national
debt
from
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
no
were
reducing
the
deficit
by
billion
billion
over
the
next
four
years
q
you
mean
youre
reducing
it
below
what
it
would
have
been
mr
stephanopoulos
exactly
q
in
fact
youre
adding
a
very
large
amount
to
the
national
debt
over
the
period
of
mr
stephanopoulos
but
were
reducing
it
far
more
from
what
it
would
have
been
thats
true
q
washingtontype
reduction
laughter
q
youre
getting
to
be
a
grumpy
old
man
q
george
has
any
decision
been
made
about
the
white
house
or
the
presidents
participation
in
the
gay
rights
march
coming
up
in
a
week
and
a
half
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
the
presidents
schedule
now
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
at
the
senate
democratic
retreat
in
jamestown
that
weekend
q
will
he
address
it
by
phone
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
that
its
a
little
far
out
but
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
in
the
senate
retreat
q
so
will
he
have
the
leaders
in
a
day
or
two
before
the
speech
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
i
would
expect
that
at
some
point
he
would
meet
with
the
leaders
of
some
of
these
groups
i
dont
know
the
schedule
on
it
though
q
will
there
be
an
aids
czar
appointed
prior
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
event
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
april
is
earth
day
what
is
the
president
going
to
do
to
mark
that
and
is
it
the
case
that
he
is
going
to
sign
the
biodiversity
treaty
that
day
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
theres
been
some
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
i
dont
know
about
signing
it
that
day
but
i
would
expect
hell
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
or
right
around
then
q
where
is
the
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
check
with
katie
mcginty
i
just
know
that
theres
been
some
work
done
but
i
dont
know
exactly
what
q
when
is
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
the
i
think
q
why
is
it
you
know
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
but
you
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
said
i
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
meet
or
when
hes
going
to
meet
q
do
you
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
actually
no
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
he
did
though
q
do
you
have
some
details
on
the
miyazawa
visit
mr
stephanopoulos
its
a
working
visit
on
friday
and
the
president
is
looking
forward
to
that
in
discussing
a
number
of
issues
including
russian
aid
and
the
japanese
stimulus
package
and
the
trade
issues
between
the
two
countries
q
there
was
some
expectations
that
a
second
aid
package
to
russia
was
going
to
be
unveiled
at
the
meeting
and
if
i
understand
it
hasnt
happened
why
is
that
or
whats
the
status
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
meeting
is
still
going
on
and
as
you
know
secretaries
bentsen
and
christopher
have
talked
about
the
outlines
of
a
possible
package
but
were
going
to
continue
to
consult
with
congress
and
our
allies
on
that
q
we
will
not
then
make
any
kind
of
announcement
during
the
twoday
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
the
meetings
not
over
yet
q
is
that
when
youre
going
to
make
one
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
ruling
out
the
possibility
q
the
presidents
going
to
announce
it
tomorrow
q
bentsen
said
that
q
yes
bentsen
said
it
would
be
tomorrow
q
so
did
christopher
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
look
at
that
but
i
believe
it
is
more
likely
that
the
announcement
will
come
out
of
tokyo
q
george
has
there
been
further
consideration
here
about
going
to
sending
the
president
out
to
los
angeles
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
theres
its
not
something
weve
ruled
out
we
dont
have
a
date
set
for
it
q
george
you
all
have
a
position
or
do
you
support
immigrations
plan
to
settle
iraqi
prisoners
in
the
united
states
mr
stephanopoulos
its
the
first
ive
heard
of
it
q
george
there
was
a
report
today
about
the
q
fortunately
laughter
q
about
the
pace
of
appointments
and
says
that
president
clinton
is
behind
president
bush
in
the
number
of
positions
that
people
have
been
nominated
for
are
you
going
to
speed
up
the
pace
of
nominations
or
where
do
you
stand
with
it
mr
stephanopoulos
we
filled
of
the
presidents
appointments
and
its
broken
down
we
have
schedule
c
noncareer
ses
pas
fulltime
im
not
sure
what
that
means
laughter
pa
fulltime
and
this
is
about
the
same
its
about
the
same
pace
of
president
bush
obviously
as
you
move
along
farther
once
you
each
level
of
appointment
actually
has
a
multiplier
effect
and
frees
up
far
more
appointments
so
we
expect
the
process
to
speed
up
but
were
at
the
pace
of
bush
obviously
wed
like
to
get
these
done
as
quickly
as
possible
i
would
point
out
that
the
fbi
background
checks
and
the
background
check
is
far
more
comprehensive
and
it
takes
more
time
than
our
predecessors
and
that
is
part
of
the
holdup
but
were
working
on
it
q
is
that
because
of
nannygate
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
an
awful
big
part
of
it
yes
q
in
the
story
this
morning
you
were
at
approximately
the
same
pace
as
bush
in
making
appointments
but
way
behind
in
winning
confirmations
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
where
the
background
checks
comes
into
play
thats
the
problem
q
thats
the
background
checks
problem
because
i
mean
you
have
a
democratic
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
no
thats
not
the
you
make
the
appointments
and
then
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
fill
out
all
the
forms
and
have
the
background
checks
done
thats
exactly
where
the
problem
is
q
whats
the
president
doing
this
afternoon
and
whats
on
the
plan
for
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
some
meetings
just
office
meetings
this
afternoon
for
the
most
part
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
probably
a
halfdozen
different
issues
and
then
hell
be
tomorrow
well
have
an
event
probably
again
focused
on
the
stimulus
and
jobs
package
out
of
here
at
the
white
house
and
friday
is
the
miyazawa
meeting
q
will
you
be
releasing
his
tax
return
tomorrow
george
mr
stephanopoulos
either
tomorrow
or
friday
q
is
there
going
to
be
a
prebriefing
regarding
the
japanese
prime
ministers
visit
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
tomorrow
but
well
probably
get
something
done
as
we
usually
do
for
these
visits
q
was
reverend
jackson
here
this
morning
and
do
you
know
what
that
was
about
mr
stephanopoulos
he
was
here
he
met
with
a
group
of
us
here
at
the
white
house
including
mack
mclarty
q
who
q
reverend
jackson
mr
stephanopoulos
reverend
jackson
mack
mclarty
me
gene
sperling
bruce
reed
jeff
watson
mark
gearan
q
talking
about
haiti
mr
stephanopoulos
we
talked
about
general
urban
policy
he
is
about
to
go
to
los
angeles
he
was
just
back
from
mississippi
where
we
had
a
good
victory
last
night
and
hes
going
on
to
los
angeles
q
did
he
request
the
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
actually
no
hes
in
continual
contact
with
the
president
he
had
written
a
letter
on
a
variety
of
issues
and
so
we
asked
him
to
come
in
and
talk
about
it
q
george
dole
is
having
a
fundraiser
for
jeffords
tonight
in
vermont
have
you
guys
been
in
contact
with
jeffords
at
all
on
this
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
been
some
contact
sure
q
can
you
tell
us
about
the
contacts
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
q
do
you
know
who
contacted
him
or
what
was
said
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
that
howard
paster
talked
to
him
and
they
just
has
a
general
talk
about
the
package
q
and
did
he
express
his
support
for
it
now
or
is
he
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
divulge
the
details
of
the
conversation
but
there
have
been
conversations
q
the
la
times
is
reporting
that
abortion
elective
abortions
is
likely
to
be
included
in
the
basic
health
care
package
is
this
something
the
president
is
considering
mr
stephanopoulos
again
q
along
with
the
vat
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
its
certainly
something
thats
been
looked
at
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
what
was
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
the
la
times
story
on
whether
abortions
will
be
covered
by
the
presidents
health
plan
q
did
the
president
in
his
meeting
did
you
in
your
meeting
with
reverend
jackson
ask
his
advice
solicit
his
advice
about
what
kind
of
stance
the
white
house
should
take
in
the
wake
of
the
verdict
in
la
mr
stephanopoulos
well
we
certainly
talked
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
and
the
longterm
prospects
for
economic
development
and
other
issues
q
for
instance
did
you
discuss
whether
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
president
to
go
there
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
well
we
discussed
a
wide
range
of
issues
related
to
los
angeles
that
was
certainly
one
of
them
q
letting
you
perhaps
go
out
on
the
way
you
came
in
i
need
to
go
back
to
bosnia
just
for
a
second
and
ask
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
good
q
your
reaction
to
margaret
thatchers
comments
that
youre
just
sitting
by
and
watching
a
massacre
mr
stephanopoulos
well
weve
been
pushing
very
hard
on
a
number
of
fronts
for
more
aggressive
action
we
will
continue
to
do
that
q
can
you
tell
us
if
youve
made
any
progress
in
your
talks
on
the
stimulus
package
getting
a
compromise
i
mean
we
dont
have
any
feel
except
talks
are
ongoing
have
you
talked
to
like
people
or
mr
stephanopoulos

think
about

shouldnt
all

then
be

it
would
lower
the
cost
and
definitely
make
them
safer
to
use
yes
i
dont
think
we
want
to
start
using
these
criterion
to
determine
legality
why
not
where
do
they

what
pray

this

exactly

you

they

not
our

dear
or
they
as
in
an
appeal
to
some
audience
that
is
supposed
to
implicitly
know
and
understand
i
really
dont
want
to
waste
time
in
here
to
do
battle
about
the
legalization
of
drugs
if
you
really
want
to
we
can
get
into
it
and
prove
just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
read
i
do
not
know
what
the
fuck
im
talking
about
and
am
not
eager
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
from
a
pragmatic
standpoint
there
certainly
is
some
justification
if
it
is
a
vice
people
will
commit
anyway
shall
we
criminalize
alcohol
again
if
the
relegalization
for
alcohol
were
done
from
anything
other
than
the
pragmatic
standpoint
id
be
happy
to
hear
about
it
the
fact
is
that
it
wasnt
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
only
the
first
one
make
any
sense
there
is
nothing
to
legalize
about
all
the
rest
just
in
case
you
havent
made
the
connection
which
i
expect
you
havent
the
connecting
theme
in
this
thread
is
a
persons
autonomy
over
their
life
and
body
vice
statutes
serve
only
to
make
it
more
expensive
for
the
rich
and
more
dangerous
for
the
poor
as
tim
so
eloquently
put
it
people
will
however
take
autonomy
over
their
lives
regardless
of
what
the
government
says
and
why
pray
tell
is
aids
victim
in
snear
quotes
are
you
of
the
revisionist
sort
that
thinks
there
is
no
such
thing
as

daevid

the
madison
edge
the
main
difference
between
adolf
hitler
and
rush
limbaugh
is
that
hitler
was
original
and
showed
initiative
mort
sahl
on
the
tom
snyder
radio
show
abc
radio
network
october
nlnsbelieve
it
or
not
i
was
planning
this
comparative
review
of
mein
kampf
and
limbaughs
transcribed
rant
the
way
things
ought
to
be
before
sahl
issued
his
comparative
review
as
usual
sahls
was
independent
and
sharp
as
a
scalpel
my
effort
can
only
dream
of
comparing
favorably
to
morts
at
least
it
has
a
fairly
popular
orginating
premise
everyone
id
mention
the
idea
to
thought
it
was
either
divinely
inspired
or
at
least
past
due
for
delivery
those
reactions
are
based
on
parallels
that
should
be
obvious
to
the
most
peripheral
observer
of
the
acts
of
those
false
prophets
both
are
noted
for
their
galvanizing
oratorical
skills
which
they
both
used
with
passion
to
generate
a
political
cult
of
massive
numerical
proportions
in
fact
limbaugh
claims
to
have
an
audience
of
just
over
million
almost
identical
to
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
hitler
in
the
april
german
election
both
used
a
myopic
social
perspective
to
build
the
cult
and
enthusiastically
amputated
facts
from
the
record
to
fabricate
their
ideological
quilt
the
last
point
is
glaringly
documented
by
passages
in
the
opening
pages
of
both
books
hitlers
example
is
when
on
page
he
claims
the
german
nationalist
terrorist
leo
schlageter
he
bombed
part
of
a
railway
line
between
dusseldorf
and
duisburg
being
caught
in
the
act
in
was
betrayed
to
france
by
a
representative
of
his
government
when
there
has
never
been
any
factual
foundation
for
such
a
statement
in
fact
the
governments
of
both
the
reich
and
prussia
as
well
as
the
vatican
actively
intervened
to
save
him
from
execution
and
almost
succeeded
limbaugh
follows
suit
by
making
the
hysterically
sarcastic
claim
in
his
introduction
that
in
a
school
or
during
a
commencement
ceremony
or
many
other
public
places
god
is
unconstitutional
of
course
its
not
god
but
the
official
imposition
of
particular
concepts
of
god
against
an
individuals
will
thats
unconstitutional
but
limbaugh
is
too
gleeful
in
his
talent
for
distortion
to
want
you
to
know
that
of
course
one
would
assume
that
by
comparing
the
two
books
my
main
point
would
be
that
the
way
things
ought
to
be
is
the
modern
american
mein
kampf
not
really
at
the
time
of
the
first
german
version
of
mein
kampf
hitler
was
just
four
months
out
of
prison
june
and
trying
to
reorganize
the
nazis
he
used
the
book
to
build
his
dozen
million
followers
limbaugh
on
the
other
hand
came
up
with
his
book
after
building
his
dozen
million
twelve
million
went
a
longer
way
in
weimar
germany
that
it
does
in
the
republicrat
united
states
thus
the
more
accurate
parallels
would
be
that
limbaughs
daily
threehour
radio
show
is
the
american
mein
kampf
the
primary
propoganda
tool
used
to
pump
up
the
angry
volume
and
that
the
way
things
ought
to
be
is
actually
the
american
triumph
of
the
will
a
translation
of
the
same
fascist
message
into
a
different
medium
also
the
printed
word
was
the
more
important
medium
in
weimar
germany
since
radio
was
still
being
thought
of
by
impoverished
germans
as
a
medium
of
luxury
in
today
on
the
other
hand
americans
are
more
likely
to
spend
a
few
seconds
to
tune
a
radio
dial
at
no
monetary
charge
than
drop
for
pages
of
transcripts
of
the
same
words
but
as
mort
sahl
also
observed
on
the
radio
the
other
night
some
cloutmeister
of
the
radical
right
wants
limbaugh
to
be
a
focal
point
of
their
propoganda
and
remember
sahl

some

passed

all
i

that

dealers

protecting

protects
the

of
us
from
low

and
high

an
excellent
point
but
you
seem
to
be
missing
a
more
subtle
point
it
is
not
the
government
that
should
be
the
recipient
of
your
displeasure
but
the
established
business
interests
that
influence
and
direct
government
action
in
this
case
it
is
the
government
that
is
preventing
entry
to
the
market
the
desire
of
those
running
established
businesses
to
prevent
or
restrict
the
entry
of
competitors
is
an
understandable
though
generally
unpleasant
human
failing
but
without
a
means
to
act
on
this
desire
without
a
government
with
sufficient
power
to
restrict
the
options
of
the
potential
competitor
the
anticompetitive
desire
remains
just
an
unpleasant
wish
the
government
is
the
linchpin
so
we
seek
to
disengage
it
so
we
dont
get
the
shaft
once
again
mark
you
dont
specify
the
means
through
which
the
government
is
to
be
prevented
from
becoming
the
tool
of
business
interests
as
a
leftwing
big
government
conventional
liberal
im
just
as
willing
as
you
are
to
vote
against
anticompetitive
regulations
that
favor
auto
dealers
but
what
i
hear
from
libertarians
is
a
desire
to
limit
incumbents
terms
to
weaken
government
by
eliminating
its
power
to
enforce
antitrust
laws
and
a
desire
to
eliminate
legislators
pay
each
strikes
me
as
a
particularly
ineffective
way
to
insure
that
auto
dealers
and
other
special
interests
cannot
influence
public
policy
in
fact
they
seem
clearly

as
noted
in
another
thread
limiting

the
problem
libertarians
face
is
insuring
that
the
limited
government
they
seek
does
not
become
the
tool
of
private
interests
to
pursue
their
own
agenda
believe
it
or
not
we
liberals
are
frequently
as
opposed
to
anticompetitive
measures
as
you
conservatives
we
dont
believe
however
that
competition
will
necessarily
be
protected
by
the
actions
of
business
interests
in
a
freemarket
after
all
in
the
example
you
cite
it
was
not
liberals
that
pressed
for
such
regulations
but
good
staunch
conservative
businessmen
as
adam
smith
so
eloquently
demonstrated
the
freemarket
is
not
something
that
capitalists
seek
to
protect
when
they
can
profit
from
its
elimination
the
same
point
was
made
by
marx
a
point
of
agreement
between
the
two
theorists
that
should
tell
us
something
i
do
not
want
the
government
to
become
a
tool
of
private
interests
limited
government
cannot
insure
that
private
interests
will
not
use
this
government
for
their
own
agenda
agreed
but
this
is
not
a
failure
of
libertarianism
it
is
the
fact
that
utopia
is
not
an
option
there
is
no
single
system
where
everything
is
perfect
it
is
a
failure
of
libertarianism
if
the
ideology
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams
just
as
marxism
fails
to
specify
how
pure
communism
is
to
be
achieved
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarians
frequently
fail
to
show
how
weakening
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in
improvement
in
the
human
condition
so
it
is
wise
to
look
for
the
best
solution
if
you
compare
countries
to
see
which
ones
people
would
rather
live
in
which
ones
have
less
starvation
hunger
poverty
and
misery
you
will
find
that
they
have
a
more
limitted
government
than
countries
with
alot
of
poverty
misery
and
suffering
no
limitted
government
cannot
insure
anything
but
it
sure
is
better
than
the
alternative
big
government
this
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fails
on
several
grounds
in
this
case
limited
and
big
government
are
not
defined
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definitions
nations
with
limited
government
while
the
us
canada
and
nations
in
western
europe
where
people
would
rather
live
are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with
big
government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds

an

as
you

what
i

from

is
a

eliminating
its

a

me
as
a

ineffective
way
to
insure
that
auto

they

no

the

funnily
the

that
it

was
never
referred

the

one

has
actually

the

to

their

dilemna
is
that

as
it
is
difficult
to
predict
and
model
wealth
creation
especially
in
an
economy
where
wealth
creation
is
inherently
the
province
of
individuals
who
create
new
inventions
and
discover
new
ideas
we
will
assume
for
the
rest
of
this
book
that
there
is
no
wealth
creation
we
do
not
assume
the
lack
of
weath
creation
in
the
real
world
however
the
mathematical
modeling
of
such
an
inherently
unpredictable
subject
is
impossible
even
though
we
assume
no
wealth
creation
we
do
believe
that
for
most
mathematical
economic
modeling
such
an
assumption
is
reasonably
valid
as
it
allows
us
to
make
predictions
which
then
can
be
tested
so
the
guys
who
are
running
the
store
for
clinton
and
company
are
now
assuming
that
wealth
creation
does
not
exists
they
are
borrowing
an
idea
from
the
hitchhikers
guide
too
advanced
to
think
of
these
simple
things

it
is
very

for
a

to
develop

a

when
they
are
constantly
being
told
implicitly
and
explicitly
that
they
are
wrong
and
immoral
yes
that
is
most
certainly
true
however
the
paragrapgh
reflects
a
valueless
position
and
infers
that
what
is
more
important
than
anything
else
is
to
have
a
positive
view
of
ones
self
this
of
course
is
foolish
should
a
mass
murderer
a
pedophile
a
old
pyromaniac
have
a
positive
view
of
themselves
of
course
not
a
person
that
engages
in
behaviour
that
a
large
number
of
people
condemn
and
if
you
believe
in
the
concept
of
society
then
your
only
choice
is
to
expect
that

to
have

maybe
by

on

they
figure
all

will

giving

since

it
was

not

allow
friday
night
for

to

also
it

as

as
give

when

a

will
remain
over

as
some

may
find
excuse
over
the

on

the

that

even
from

also
some

may
take

writes
as
dawidowicz
points
out
in
the
holocaust
and
the
historians
harvard
university
press
the
nadir
in
hitlerology
is
reached
by
david
irvings
hitlers
an
amateur
historian
whose
reputation
as
a
german
apologist
and
as
a
writer
without
regard
for
accuracy
or
truth
won
him
a
measure
of
notoriety
irving
produced
a
work
intended
to
show
that
hitler
was
kind
to
his
animals
and
to
his
secretaries
that
he
was
probably
the
weakest
leader
germany
has
known
in
this
century
and
that
he
did
not
murder
the
jews
or
even
wish
to
do
so
but
that
the
murder
was
committed
behind
his
back
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
was
indeed
the
case
does
this
mean
that
hilter
would
have
been
in
any
way
less
guilty
of
mass
murder
because
he
aquiesced
rather
than
participated
as
an
active
and
ardent
supporter
one
of
the
important
things
to
realise
about
the
nazis
is
that
the
system
was
far
more
evil
than
any
single
member
once
created
the
nazi
party
itself
was
a
murder
machine
that
would
inevitably
commit
genocide
there
was
noone
within
it
strong
enough
to
prevent
it
remember
that
hitler
did
not
originaly
lead
the
nazi
party
nor
was
he
particularly
powerful
within
it
until
his
oratory
allowed
the
party
to
come
to
power
had
hitler
reneged
upon
the
emotiaonal
expectations
which
he
had
created
within
the
ranks
of
his
supporters
he
would
have
been
replaced
as
he
had
himself
replaced
the
old
guard
who
he
beleived
were
unable
to
grasp
the
intellectual
implications
of
their
rhetoric
this
is
why
all
parties
that
espouse
nazi
style
race
supremacy
ideologies
must
be
considered
as
dangerous
and
as
evil
as
the
nazis
the
idea
that
one
race
of
people
is
inherently
superior
to
another
and
that
the
greatest
goal
of
humanity
is
to
achieve
racial
perfection
has
only
one
logical
outcome
the
gas
chambers
of
auschwitz
the
nazi
party
is
not
simply
the
tale
of
a
supremely
evil
single
man
who
lead
an
entire
country
astray
beyond
the
evil
of
individuals
there
was
the
evil
of
the
system
itself
which
was
self
generating
and
self
perpetuating
hitler
was
an
extreemly
evil
person
who
built
his
party
arround
an
ego
cult
centered
on
the
demonstration
of
his
own
power
this
does
not
however
mean
that
he
was
as
entirely
free
from
political
constraints
as
he
and
his
propagandists
worked
so
hard
to
assert
the
myth
that
racism
can
produce
a
strong
government
that
can
cure
a
nations
ills
must
be
emphatically
rejected
in
the
same
way
we
must
accept
a
distinction
between
a
govenrment
that
demonstrates
its
strength
and
one
that
is
able
to
govern
decisively
in
the
manner
it
beleives
is
best
i
would
accept
only
the
latter
as
a
strong
government
since
most
displays
of
strength
are
made
necessary
by
an
essential
weakness
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
nazis
were
not
stupid
nor
were
they
amoral
in
the
sense
that
they
lacked
moral
scruples
they
acted
in
the
same
manner
as
the
spanish
inquisition
murder
and
torture
in
the
cause
of
morality
the
fault
of
the
nazis
lies
in
their
axioms
not
in
their
logic
nor
in
their
implementation
of
those
axioms
thus
all
such
parties
such
as
the
national
front
or
david
dukes
klu
klux
klan
front
who
assert
the
truth
of
those
axioms
must
be
considered
for
what
they
are
advocates
of
a
system
that
would
commit
genocide
the
conclusion
that
hitler
was
not
only
responsible
but
imensely
evil
is
inescapable
from
the
historical
record
it
is
important
though
to
not
let
the
conclusion
be
reached
that
the
nazis
espoused
a
set
of
ideas
that
were
basically
correct
but
had
an
unfortunate
proponent
the
evils
of
the
concept
of
race
supremacy
are
primary
although
this
most
emphaticaly
does
not
excuse
individual
culpability
this
is
nevertheless
secondary
no
matter
what
the
promises
made
by
a
racist
supremacist
party
upon
election
those
promises
will
be
broken
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit
if
this
requires
the
replacement
of
the
leaders
that
originally
made
the
pledges
that
will
occur
hatred
is
a
supreme
justifier
it
also
creates
a
dynamic
of
its
own
when
those
in
government
allow
it
reign
for
many
in
government
politics
is
a
method
of
providing
a
justification
for
their
own
existence
through
a
demonstration
of
their
importance
a
rhetoric
of
hatred
inevitably
develops
the
question
of
action
since
the
continued
existence
of
an
object
of
hatred
is
inevitably
a
reminder
of
the
essential
impotence
of
the
politician
thus
we
have
the
us
raid
on
tripoli
which
has
little
purpose
beyond
a
demonstration
of
power
it
is
important
to
realise
that
there
is
no
quantum
jump
between
the
politics
of
the
right
and
those
of
the
extreeme
right
but
a
progression
from
the
reinforcement
of
popular
predjudice
to
action
being
taken
on
the
basis
of
that
predjudice
in
the
same
way
the
extreeme
left
trace
their
route
to
despotism
through
their
assertion
of
the
subjugation
of
the
individual
to
ideology
it
is
important
though
that
in
attempting
to
understand
the
dynamics
of
political
systems
that
this
is
not
used
to
excuse
the
participants
the
leaders
of
a
nation
take
on
a
supreme
moral
burden
but
not
only
do
so
voluntarily
are
required
to
stive
to
do
so
thus
to
take
on
such
a
task
without
a
fundamental
examination
of
the
logical
progression
of
ones
set
of
axioms
to
its
conclusion
in
itself
is
a
moral
crime
furthermore
in
taking
on
such
a
duty
one
is
obliged
to
put
the
interest
of
the
whole
before
personal
concerns
even
of
personal
security
although
it
was
inevitable
that
a
party
such
as
the
nazis
based
upon
hatred
and
an
idolisation
of
the
symbols
of
power
should
have
saught
to
commit
genocide
it
was
not
inevitable
that
they
should
succeeded
each
member
of
the
system
had
an
ability
to
create
a
change
within
it
that
had
a
possibility
of
changing
the
dynamic
realising
that
the
individual
cannot
hope
to
control
a
system
does
not
mean
accepting
that
the
individual
cannot
affect
the
system

with

in

i
think
canada
illustrates
that
gun

does
have
an
effect
in
fact
its
suprising
that
there
is
any
difference
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
smuggle
a
gun
from
the
us
yes
its
amazing
isnt
it
in
fact
it
should
tell
you
that
gun
control
is
not
the
reason
your
crime
rate
is
low
since
any
idiot
can
smuggle
guns
into
canada
from
the
us
at
any
time
i
think
paul
was
trying
to
make
the
point
that
any
idiot
doesnt
there
are
surely
some
idiots
who
do
smuggle
guns
but
paul
seems
to
feel
that
the
exis
tence
of
stricter
gun
control
laws
has
had
a
deterrent
effect
this
seems
a
strange
argument
to
make
considering
that
canadas
violent
crime
rate
in
general
is
far
lower
than
that
of
the
us
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
greater
than
their
entire
crime
rate
it
would
seem
strange
to
suggest
that
it
to
were
the
result
of
gun
control
laws
i
think
if
we
looked
wed
find
very
specific
cultural
and
enforcement
reasons
why
the
nongun
rate
is
low
as
well
and
then
that
reasons
could
be
applied
to
the
withgun
rates
as
easily
given
that
most
criminally
used
guns
are
either
legally
purchased
or
stolen
from
those
who
purchase
them
legally
having
more
restrictions
on
legal
possession
does
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
reducing
gunrelated
crimes
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
find
the
idea
of
being
punished
because
somebody
might
steal
something
from
me
and
go
and
commit
a
crime
with
it
a
silly
solution
it
still
doesnt
address
the
question
of
canada
which
is
now
by
the
way
blaming
their
rising
guncrime
rate
on
the
us
strange
that
the
border
used
to
magically
keep
the
guns
out
but
now
isnt
it
certainly
makes
sense
that
it
would
well
it
makes
sense
to
some
of
us
anyway
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
course
is
that
far
illegal
drugs
are
purchases
legally
or
stolen
from
people
who
purchase
them
legally
ive
still
not
been
convinced
that
guns
a
commodity
which
criminals
have
shown
their
perfectly
willing
to
pay
for
from
illegal
sources
stolen
either
from
police
military
or
civilian
we
wouldnt
simply
see
south
american
sources
from
which
drugs
come
start
smuggling
guns
as
well
since
theres
a
thriving
gun
manufacturing
industry
down
there
if
you
would
just
look
a
little
closer
at
the
crime
statistics
you
would
realize
that
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
also
very
high
so
guns
per
se
are
not
the
issue
directly
contradicted
by
the
nejm
study
that
compared
crime
in
seattle
and
vancouver
bc
the
nongun
rates
were
roughly
the
same
for
both
cities
the
difference
in
violent
crime
rates
was
almost
totally
gunrelated
and
as
was
not
pointed
out
in
the
study
but
in
critiques
of
it
two
seperate
articles
by
james
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
difference
was
also
almost
entirely
minority
related
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocketed
for
poor
minorities
blacks
and
hispanics
primarily
while
when
you
compared
the
white
majority
they
were
virutally
identical
the
problem
with
the
nejm
study
was
they
compared
minority
vs
nonminority
percentages
but
failed
to
take
into
account
the
relative
conditions
of
those
minorities
that
there
was
an
eqaul
percentage
of
nomnwhites
was
about
as
far
as
they
went
they
failed
to
take
into
account
that
the
nonwhites
in
either
city
were
not
living
in
the
same
conditions
if
the
situation
was
entirely
based
on
availability
of
guns
then
wed
expect
that
the
white
rates
the
two
groups
which
are
arguably
fairly
comparative
in
the
two
cities
would
have
a
far
higher
rate
in
seattle
yet
the
majority
in
seattle
is
not
only
not
significantly
higher
when
the
minorities
are
excluded
but
slightly
lower
violent
crime
is
highly
concentrated
in
the
inner
city
surprise
pick
the
area
with
the
highest
incidence
of
poverty
drug
use
disease
etc
since
rates
are
lower
in
suburbia
us
middle
class
folks
can
ignore
the
problem
the
point
is
of
course
that
many
of
the
us
innercity
problems
are
not
mirrored
in
canada
as
such
if
there
is
a
condition
which
is
significantly
different
in
canada
from
the
us
and
violent
crime
is
highly
correlated
to
that
area
suggesting
that
gun
control
is
the
source
of
canadas
low
rate
is
highly
questionable
as
one
canadian
pointed
out
on
talkpoliticsguns
canadas
major
gun
control
in
did
not
result
in
either
a
reduction
or
a
slowing
of
an
increase
in
violent
crime
rates
which
have
been
rising
steadily
since
apparently
they
didnt
even
mirror
the
uss
very
large
drop
of
violent
crime
in
the
early
eighties
most
violent
crime
occurs
in
areas
with
strict
gun
control
already
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
areas
implemented
gun
control
because
of
the
high
rates
true
only
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
was
instituted
while
it
had
crime
problems
true
but
that
crime
proceeded
to
explode
afterwards
similarly
for
new
york
the
question
is
not
simply
a
point
in
time
where
crime
was
high
or
low
did
the
gun
control
significantly
and
positively
impact
violent
crime
since
its
gone
up
in
those
areas
often
faster
than
it
was
going
up
before
you
cant
simply
dismiss
the
high
crime
rate
by
saying
gun
control
was
caused
by
it
yes
gun
control
may
be
instituted
to
deal
with
high
crime
but
if
the
crime
is
not
positively
impacted
you
cant
continually
say
that
that
crime
rate
was
entirely
a
cause
of
that
gun
control
since
much
of
that
crime
rate
increased
after
gun
control
was
implemented
just
as
happened
in
canada
similar
or
worse
rates
exist
in
cities
with
poor
gun
control
as
would
be
expected
if
violent
crime
was
generally
independent
of
gun
control
and
the
jury
is
still
out
on
the
question
of
whether
recent
tough
laws
in
washington
dc
may
have
alleviated
violence
and
suicide
rates
there
would
this
be
the
laws
which
made
manufacturers
liable
for
what
others
did
with
their
guns
and
suddenly
the
police
found
nobody
would
sell

them

what
maddison

were
up

there
are
a

one
is
we

so
well
say
anything
that
we

will
appeal

you
or
the
more
straightforward
this
is
why
we
think
what
weve
suggested
in
this
constitution
is
a
good
idea
you
clearly
consider
the
former
to
be
the
primary
situation
the
point
is
that
they
did
not
make
pains
to
point
out
where
the
consitution
may
have
been
aginst
the
new
yorkers
interests
also
they
did
not
want
to
raise
opposition
by
basing
their
advocacy
on
unpopular
principles
horrors
appealing
to
popular
principles
can
we
perhaps
as
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
might
have
been
written
to
appeal
to
the
principles
rather
than
as
you
appear
to
believe
it
was
written
with
something
else
in
mind
and
propoganda
put
out
by
its
supporters
but
lets
be
honest
about
something
here
when
was
the
last
time
you
brought
up
all
the
valid
points
against
your
own
arguments
or
are
they
simply
propogranda
we
cant
know
what
phill
really
means
because
hes
obviously
using
arguments
designed
to
convince
well
i
know
hamilton
was
a
dyed
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probably
the
authoritarian
extreme
to
jeffersons
democratic
impules
but
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
means
of
determining
their
opinions
on
the
government
if
we
dont
consider
what
they
wrote
about
the
government
i
dont
propose
that
any
means
exists
for
determining
their
true
opinions
thus
their
true
opinions
died
with
them
and
are
of
little
help
today
their
opinions
have
not
the
slightest
bearing
on
the
matter
though
only
their
arguments
these
are
true
or
false
regardless
of
who
said
them
or
why
if
theyre
true
or
false
regardles
of
why
they
were
said
why
on

did
you
make
a
point
of
calling
them
propogranda
that
would
seem
to
be
irrelevent
the
difficulty
that
most
us
posters
seem
to
have
is
in
considering
that
their
arguments
may
have
been
flawed
or
no
longer
apply
to
modern
societies
oh
i
have
no
argument
with
questioning
them
i
dont
believe
they
no
longer
apply
but
thats
because
i
think
most
of
them
were
good
arguments
im
not
entirely
happy
about
the
situation
because
they
were
obviously
only
applied
to
a
minority
of
the
time
but
i
dont
think
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
them
if
they
were
alive
today
the
one
opinion
we
could
count
upon
these
men
to
express
is
that
a
careful
study
of
the
mechanisms
of
government
is
necessary
and
that
an
ongoing
improvement
of
the
same
is
required
they
gave
their
opinions
in
certain
areas
and
have
been
proved
right
in
other
areas
they
got
it
wrong
they
ensured
that
there
was
a
mechanism
to
adapt
and
improve
the
consititution
this
can
only
happen
if
there
is
a
willingness
to
accept
that
the
structural
problems
within
the
us
political
system
may
require
constitutional
change
as
a
solution
since
the
us
constitution
is
the
basis
for
the
us
political
system
most
changes
in
it
would
require
constitutional
change
in
this
particular
case
however
the
fillibuster
is
a
matter
of
procedure
and
tradition
it
only
should
have
been
made
part
of
the
constitution
if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principle
no
in
practice
yes
in
principle
no
that
they
had
less
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
less
power
the
british
government
today
is
theoreticaly
dependent
on
the
will
of
the
monarch
by
convention
any
monarch
seeking
to
exercise
that
power
is
deposed
the
subtly
is
that
the
prime
minister
is
not
able
to
identify
their
politics
with
the
national
interest
in
the
same
manner
that
us
presidents
regularly
do
phill
were
discusing
the
power
of
legislative
houses
while
the
prime
minister
is
member
of
parliament
he
is
more
analgous
although
badly
to
the
us
president
now
please
explain
to
me
how
the
us
house
of
representatives
is
in
principle
more
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
or
the
senate
but
in
practice
is
less
are
you
suggesting
that
the
writers
of
the
constitution
really
intended
for
them
to
be
more
powerful
but
gosh
darn
the
thing
was
ratified
before
they
realized
theyd
forgotten
to
put
those
extra
restrictions
on
the
senate
in
i
disagree
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
was
simply
designed
to
handle
less
than
it
has
demanded
that
it
handle
as
somebody
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
has
become
everybodys
city
council
one
reason
for
that
is
that
at
every
level
the
government
is
rendered
unable
to
come
to
decisions
these
decisions
are
pushed
up
to
the
next
higher
level
instead
not
at
all
as
any
entry
level
political
science
course
will
tell
you
people
who
want
laws
implemented
will
always
choose
the
level
of
government
to
attack
which
presents
them
with
the
best
chance
of
getting
what
they
want
with
national
interest
groups
it
is
simply
a
very
rational
thing
to
do
to
want
the
federal
government
to
enact
a
law
rather
than
the
states
less
people
to
persuade
and
less
contributions
to
make
why
do
those
concerned
about
abortion
primarily
concentrate
at
the
federal
level
simply
because
if
they
win
that
battle
all
the
little
state
battlefields
are
won
by
extension
the
same
extends
to
insurance
medicine
and
most
other
questions
local
government
has
not
failed
in
that
it
hasnt
done
what
it
should
but
that
it
is
dominated
by
local
interests
thus
nonlocal
interests
who
want
localities
to
abide
by
their
rules
cant
get
their
rules
past
the
local
government
thus
since
theyve
got
more
clout
only
in
the
wrong
place
they
appeal
to
the
next
higher
level
because
it
can
impose
its
will
on
the
lower
i
mean
lets
get
real
here
do
we
really
need
the
congres
of
the
united
states
deciding
that
x
traffice
light
should
be
on
thus
and
such
pattern
or
that
carjacking
needs
to
be
a
federal
as
opposed
to
a
local
crime
the
more
people
want
the
more
congress
will
take
power
to
sell
it
to
them
for
their
votes
i
dont
think
the
rise
of
special
interests
is
coincidence
with
the
increased
power
of
congress
congress
is
more
than
capable
of
quick
action
and
has
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
its
hands
if
it
confined
itself
to
what
its
original
jurisidiction
was
and
allowed
more
local
autonomy
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfare
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidy
motto
they
would
be
better
placed
as
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
state
money
being
handed
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
governmental
ladder
the
less
actual
need
matters
because
political
power
can
be
concentrated
at
higher
levels
while
people
with
less
cloud
only
find
themselves
reduced
to
in
effectiveness
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
states
with
pork
defense
contracts
agricultural
subsidies
etc
or
to
be
precise
of
the
states
since
you
need
to
beat
the
filibuster
then
why
not
simply
leave
new
yorks
education
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinved
that
there
is
any
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capable
of
educating
its
own
children
if
thats
what
they
want
to
do
and
if
you
leave
it
to
them
you
only
have
to
worry
about
the
pork
in
that
state
and
since
industries
cant
concentrate
their
political
power
and
wealth
rather
they
must
divide
it
among
the
states
to
try
and
get
what
they
want
individual
voices
have
more
relative
impact
the
problem
with
the
fillibuster
is
not
that
you
must
buy
off
states
but
that
the
congress
has
acquired
too
much
power
to
sell
pork
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
government
they
created
failing
but
that
it
is
operating
under
a
set
of
conditions
they
specifically
wanted
to
avoid
namely
a
concentration
of
power
it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduce
the
power
of
either
house
in
some
attempt
to
grease
the
wheels
all
youll
get
then
is
a
system
which
moves
quicker
to
do
stupid
things
it
would
make
more
sense
to
make
more
decisions
at
a
local
level
no
you
have
to
break
the
machine
free
of
seizure
before
you
can
redirect
it
but
why
on
earth
should
we
want
to
redirect
it
you
said
yourself
that
you
have
to
sell
pork
to
get
things
through
congress
if
congres
has
less
authority
to
sell
pork
and
retains
its
authority
to
enact
national
legislation
within
its
granted
jurisdiction
the
pork
problem
is
significantly
reduced
the
current
blocks
on
power
simply
absolve
congress
of
any
responsibility
to
come
to
a
decision
the
current
blocks
essentially
state
that
inaction
is
preferable
to
action
thus
it
the
system
is
weighted
against
action
considering
the
government
the
usually
the
institution
with
the
sole
power
to
enforce
its
decisions
by
force
i
consider
bias
against
making
those
decisions
a
good
thing
pushing
the
decisions
lower
in
the
pyramid
wont
work
unless
the
lower
levels
are
less
corrupt
in
most
cases
they
are
worse
not
better
the
difference
with
the
lower
pyramid
is
that
a
they
have
more
legal
legitimate
authority
in
most
matters
under
our
constitution
than
the
federal
government
and
b
at
those
lower
levels
power
is
harder
to
concentrate
and
c
you
get
the
benefit
of
not
imposing
new
deicisons
on
everybody
at
once
you
get
to
see
them
tried
out
without
a
national
decision
congressional
action
usually
treats
the
entire
country
as
a
whole
yet
even
with
similar
problems
in
different
areas
different
solutions
may
be
called
for
and
while
i
often
dont
agree
with
the
decisions
my
local
and
state
reps
make
at
least
i
have
a
better
option
of
going
to
the
city
council
and
shooting
my
mouth
off
id
much
rather
the
majority
of
laws
be
made
by
accessible
people
who
hang
around
and
end
up
having
to
put
up
with
them
rather
than
somebody
far
off
in
washington
with
half
a
million
or
more
constituents
im
curious
what
you
base
your
assumption
that
lower
levels
are
more
corrupt
i
fail
to
see
where
any
restrictions
implied
or
otherwise
were
placed
on
the
veto
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
read
as
a
means
to
put
a
check
on
democratically
popular
but
unwise
in
the
executives
opinion
policies
since
we
were
arguing
from
the
federalist
papers
i
would
point
to
them
phill
you
brought
up
the
federalist
papers
we
were
arguing
the
fillibuster
and
whether
or
not
a
minority
of
senators
should
be
allowed
to
hold
up
a
bill
you
claimed
the
senate
was
suppose
to
be
a
far
less
powerful
house
and
i
contended
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
other
writings
which
indicated
this
which
was
when
you
brought
up
that
we
cant
decide
what
the
founders
wanted
based
on
the
federalist
papers
you
argued
against
them
i
never
argued
from
them
i
have
primarily
referred
to
the
constitution
which
places
only
very
small
restrictions
on
the
senate
than
for
the
house
the
us
constitution
gives
almost
no
reasoning
as
to
how
it
should
work
the
only
part
where
a
reason
is
given
is
the
right
to
bear
arms
ammendment
where
the
well
regulated
militia
justification
is
ambiguous
the
us
constitution
is
a
nutsandbolts
document
the
delcaration
of
independence
was
the
highbrow
reasoning
there
are
a
couple
of
other
examples
though
such
as
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
tax
and
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
grant
permits
both
in
article
i
section
that
the
veto
was
meant
to
be
an
exceptional
measure
follows
from
the
fact
of
the
senate
if
the
president
was
meant
to
revise
legislation
then
there
would
be
three
chambers
of
the
legislature
not
two
furthermore
the
separation
of
powers
would
have
been
much
less
distinct
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believe
the
veto
has
become
something
it
wasnt
intended
however
i
also
believe
it
is
inevitable
considering
the
congress
own
abuse
of
their
power
to
make
bills
say
whatever
they
want
them
to
say
unlike
most
people
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worrying
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessitates
its
abuse
there
is
no
limit
in
the
constitution
to
the
presidents
veto
power
regarding
what
a
bill
is
for
previous
presidents
have
used
the
veto
for
any
number
of
reasons
most
usually
having
something
to
do
with
their
agenda
i
am
really
curious
how
you
single
bush
out
as
the
president
who
abused
vetos
he
has
the
record
for
vetos
bush
phill
thats
absurd
bush
had
vetos
one
of
which
was
overridden
go
read
up
on
fdr
if
you
think
thats
anything
resembling
a
record
why
is
it
not
a
reasonable
restriction
because
senators
is
the
magic
holy
number
upon
which
laws
must
be
based
if
senators
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constituencies
to
stand
up
and
fillibuster
isnt
that
enough
to
indicate
theres
a
sufficient
question
as
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevaluate
it
up
to
a
point
the
fact
is
though
that
when
the
majority
are
opposed
by
a
minority
the
minority
should
not
be
allowed
to
win
by
default
why
not
what
is
inherently
wrong
with
biasing
the
system
against
action
historically
governemnt
action
in
the
us
when
dealing
with
issues
with
a
bare
minority
and
a
large
minority
have
not
been
successful
when
youre
in
a
position
of
imposing
federal
power
on
diverse
people
why
should
the
federal
government
not
have
to
got
through
something
more
than
a
bare
majority
why
one
earth
should
be
sufficient
to
enact
a
law
which
covers
million
people
in
very
very
diverse
places
and
living
in
radically
different
conditions
why
shouldnt
a
supermajority
be
required
because
the
bill
at
issue
is
a
money
bill
relating
to
a
short
term
proposal
now
were
switching
from
a
general
question
of
a
fillibuster
to
a
specific
bill
i
dont
see
how
it
make
a
difference
it
is
not
a
change
in
the
law
where
a
presupposition
in
favour
of
the
status
quo
is
arguable
sure
its
arguable
theyre
arguing
it
however
requiring
to
bring
it
to
a
vote
ensures
that
theyll
have
to
have
a
good
argument
something
that
isnt
based
solely
on
party
lines
any
system
in
which
the
simple
majority
is
given
absolute
power
to
ignore
the
minority
then
the
minority
will
be
ignored
i
do
not
see
this
as
a
positive
thing
and
for
all
that
im
sure
the
republicans
are
looking
for
pork
as
much
as
the
democrats
theyve
got
some
legitimate
objections
to
the
legislation
in
question
so
instead
you
consider
a
system
under
which
the
minority
automatically
win
to
be
superior
no
i
am
completely
happy
with
a
system
which
requires
a
minority
for
action
since
us
history
is
a
history
of
carving
up
population
groups
and
implementing
piecemeal
on
minorities
i
feel
minorities
should
have
sufficent
clout
to
prevent
action
they
feel
strongly
enough
about
and
is
hardly
a
tiny
minority
i
dont
advocate
the
minority
being
capable
of
initiating
actionm
but
i
see
no
problem
with
biasing
the
federal
system
against
action

because

unusual
even

starts
out
without
racial

as
after
all
we
all
do
and
no
one
teaches
them
to

its
sometimes
hard
to
see
how
they
can
avoid
becoming
so
based
on
their
own
observations
and
instinct
for
selfpreservation
we
always
taught
our

that
racial

bad

also
mistaken

how
do
you
counteract

what

it

the

treating

you
can
start
by
teaching
your
children
that
the
perpetrators
of
crimes
no
more
represent
the
black
community
than
racist
hateful
whites
represent
the
majority
culture
although
there
are
many
ethnic
minorities
who
have
fallen
into
the
very
trap
that
you
are
struggling
with
and
believe
otherwise
the
trap
is
the
easy
way
out
for
yourself
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
realize
that
the
demographics
related
to
the
crimes
you
speak
of
have
less
to
do
with
race
and
much
to
do
with
socioeconomic
status
and
disenfranchisement
youre
going
to
find
higher
crime
within
any
community
comprised
of
any
ethnic
group
or
subgroup
that
has
become
dysfunctional
whatever
the
factors
leading
to
that
dysfunction
with
ethnic
minorities
it
is
more
usually
than
not
as
i
said
socioeconomic
disenfranchisement
if
for
example
you
lived
in
an
area
where
there
were
very
few
blacks
but
quite
a
few
poorforgenerations
whites
youd
see
the
crime
statistics
reflecting
the
dysfunction
of
those
white
people
would
you
then
worry
about
whther
your
children
would
begin
to
see
whites
as
undesireable
or
whatever
the
trap
springs
into
action
when
our
innate
compunction
to
define
us
and
other
raises
its
little
voice
the
trap
becomes
dangerous
when
we
stop
to
listen
to
that
little
voice
and
stop
thinking
like
rational
humans
its
interesting
that
blacks
are
traditionally
seen
as
the
or
the
most
criminal
element
in
many
of
our
urban
areas
i
dont
know
the
racial
makeup
of
phoenix
so
i
cant
speak

your
situation
however
i
live

san

its
ethnic
diversity
here
we
have
black
gangs
hispanic
gangs
asian
yes
the

minority
gangs
and
even
a
few
white
gangs
the
asian
gangs
have
become
a
particularly
troublesome
element
for
law
enforcement
here
mainly
due
i
think
to
their
propensity
for
engaging
in
organized
criminal
activities
but
ask
people
on
the
street
and
theyll
times
tell
you
that
black
gangs
and
crime
are
what
they
most
fear
during
the
disturbance
in
los
angeles
last
year
many
of
the
rioters
and
looters
were
not
black
some
were
even
white
i
remember
being
amazed
at
television
news
scenes
that
showed
looting
mobs
where
there
were
maybe
one
or
two
blacks
at
most
my
perceptions
gleaned
from

news
were
further
corroborated
by
numerous
friends
and
relatives
that
live
in
los

this
may
have
been
the
countrys
first
truly
multiethnic
riot
yet
i
know
from
facetoface
and
online
discussion
that
in
the
minds
of
america
the
popular
perception
is
that
it
was
a
black
riot
in
closing
id
like
to
say
that
you
raise
some
interesting
points
that
really
need
discussion
our
country
has
spent
too
long
ignoring
the
racism
and
its
attendant
ills
that
is
very
much
a

of
our
culture
as

to
face
up

and
the

to
the
chair
for
selling
drugs
to
kids
now
theres
some
bit
yeah
thats
it
send
a
kid
from
the
innercity
who
has
no
other
viable
means
to
make
money
and
turns
to
selling
drugs
to
an
overcrowded
federal
prison
where
he
learns
to
do
real
crime
of
course
this
kid
would
be
much
better
off
selling
crack
to
his
neighborhood
and
helping
in
its
demise
without
drug
money
being
pumped
into
these
blights
from
the
affluent
outside
there
would
be
no
crime
who
would
they
steal
from
each
other
drugs
bring
money
into
the
community
just
like
any
other
business
would
except
that
since
drugs
are
illegal
the
economy
is
an
underground
one
and
if
those
drugs
were
legal
the
neighborhood
could
legally
go
to
hell
a
selfsustaining
underground
economy
can
only
proliferate
by
a
constant
willful
infusion
of
money
from
the
outside
if
you
take
away
drug
laws
you
put
an
end
to
the
underground
economy
and
therefore
to
largescale
crime
and
if
we
made
murder
legal
we
would
put
an
end
to
murder
as
a
crime
kids
in
the
innercities
are
faced
with
a
very
tough
life
growing
up
there
or
selling
drugs
and
having
everything
at
their
fingertips
instantly
many
kids
choose
selling
drugs
they
sell
products
to
people
who
want
to
buy
them
they
make
money
off
of
rich
white
kids
from
the
suburbs
then
they
go
to
prison
then
they
become
hardened
criminals
and
learn
that
youre
much
better
off
stealing
carstereos
in
the
suburbs
because
all
the
police
forces
are
spending
all
their
money
in
the
inner
city
saving
people
from
themselves
what
you
can
bring
up
all
the
examples
you
want
about
crackbabies
and
whathaveyou
the
solution
never
has
anything
to
do
with
the
laws
crack
is
illegal
so
you
are
saying
crack
babies
who
are
that
way
legally
are
okay
no
social
problem
however
great
is
worth
destroying
the
freedom
in
america
the
destruction
of
freedom
is
never
an
answer
to
any
social

you
cant
even
walk
down

at

alone

you

the
public

covers
beyond

or
the
same
cash
amount
for
a

and
the
difference
is
paid
outofpocket
or
according
to
your
supplementary
private

over
of
french
have
some
form
of
extra
private
insurance
so
of
health
costs
in
europe
are
out
of
private

and
not
gleaned
from
other

the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public

private

for
total

using
the

methods
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
that
the
french
had
deductibles
and
copayments
in
their
insurance
fund
is
to
their
credit
i
am
in
the
minority
for
advocating
such
back
in
canada
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
im
one
of
the
few
people
who
favour
copayments
forget
about
leftists
even
our
conservatives
attack
me
for
it
on
the
canadian
newsgroups
to
make
it
look
more
like
real
insurance
cos
the
insurance
payment
is
hidden
unlike
in
france
and
if
you
didnt
know
it
youd
believe
it
actually
is
socialized
medicine
american
conservativeslibertarians
and
canadian
leftists
are
the
only
ones
who
seriously
call
it
that
canadians
arent
worried
about
the
americans
who
spend
were
worried
about
the
french
and
germans
who
spend
to
our
so
the
insurance
is
looking
at
things
that
shouldnt
be
paid
for
out
of
general
funds
like
physicals
for
insurance
policies
sick
notes
electrolysis
etc
the
reason
that
the
canadian
health
insurance
hasnt
spiralled
out
of
control
despite
being
open
and
universal
is
that
unlike
americans
there
is
no
urge
to
spend
all
of
your
benefits
worth
and
more
if
you
can
were
a
different
culture
like
the
play
or
pay
model
managed
competition
leaves
in
place
two
elements
of
the
current
health
care
system
that
reformers
most
often
criticize
the
private
forprofit
insurance
industry
and
the
employerbased
system
of
coverage
managed
competition
compels
employers
to
enroll
their
workers
in
large
pools
of
health
insurance
customers
entire
industries
may
for
example
sponsor
a
pool
or
network
insurance
companies
doctors
hospitals
and
other
health
care
providers
then
bid
for
the
pools
business
competing
in
theory
on
the
basis
of
price
and
quality
managed
care
relies
on
hmos
which
are
unknown
in
most
western
nations
that
use
only
public
health
insurance
like
canada
france
and
germany
im
canadian
and
my
german
fatherinlawtobe
says
of
hmonhs
approaches
we
left
that
behind
with
east
germany
sure
hmonhs
controls
costs
because
you
have
managers
strangling
doctors
with
budget
strings
in
canada
we
use
the
public
health
insurance
approach
as
in
france
and
germany
with
all
private
doctors
and
both
private
and
public
hospitals
it
is
all
pure
insurance
without
hmos
the
divisions
are
different
with
the
germans
using
a
couple
hundred
interlinked
sickness
funds
over
a
century
old
while
canada
divides
by
their
provinces
who
run
the
insurance
fund
and
set
local
fees
with
the
doctors
monopoly
federal
funds
cover
the
fees
disbursed
with
such
an
openended
system
its
no
surprise
that
canada
is
to
the
us
in
costs
allinsurance
is
the
most
expensive
way
to
go
the
french
and
germans
use
the
same
approach
but
have
larger
populations
in
more
compact
geography
to
improve

eight

an

thats

vancouver
canada
thats
because
among
other
things
theyve
given
their
government
power
to
bargain
with
doctors
and
hospitals
over
fees
the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the
fees
lack
of
defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of

is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most

approach
of
pure

in

along
with

and
germany
without

the
nyt
has
admitted
that

insurance
fees
are
an
order
of
magnitude
lower
in
canada
but
doctors
takehome
pay
is
almost
equal
to

also
minimal
bureaucracy
cos
the

is
sooo
simple
early
march
part

the
deal
for
using
the
allinsurance
approach
like
the
french
and
germans
do
hey
why
dont
they
criticize
france
and
germany
is
it
because
too
many
people
take
french
and
german
in
college
to
make
the
accusations
stick
was
to
preserve
the
doctors
independance
since
the
provincial
wings
of
the
cma
are
the
ones
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedule
hikes
are
presented
the
politicallybent
doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike
in
socialized
medicine
approaches
like
britains
national
health
service
youve
got
to
remember
youve
got
a
waiting
list
as
well
but
its
not
as
obvious
if
youre
poor
and
you
dont
have
insurance
you
dont
go
to
a
surgeon
in
the
states
you
ration
by
ability
to
pay
for
nonlife
threatening

market
arguments
adequately
cover
why
certain

are
in
scarcer
demand
i
have
md
friends
who
cant
make
a

back
in

not
due
to

but
because
they

the

medical
monopolys
grip

licencing

so
they

however
this
does
not
refute
debunking
of

doug

article
from
weeks

about
canadas
health
insurance
approach
on
talkpoliticsmedicine
there
is
one
small
error
in
the
article
not
all
of
our
hospitals
are
private
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
of
course
the
one
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
canadafrancegermany
case
private
insurance
offloaded
the
basic
coverage
to
the
public
sector
they
realized
they
were
keeping
lowriskhighprofit
extra
insurance
for
things
like
privatesemiprivate
rooms
vs
ward
accomodation
dental
glasses
etc
for
corporate
or
personal
benefits
theyll
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
if
you
want
to
be
covered
for
basic
care
at
that
point
they
wouldnt
even
consider
a
voucher
approach
to
broker
the
universal
coverage
and
sell
policies
to
make
up
the
difference
in
the
federal
guidelines
and
market
stuff
wouldnt
free
care
encourage
people
to
run
to
the
doctor
for
every
ache
and
pain
people
who
get
free
treatment
do
go
to
the
doctor
and
hospital
about
a
third
more
often
than
those
who
have
to
pay
a
share
of
their
medical
bills
still
canadians
who
pay
nothing
at
the
doctors
have
a
lower
perperson
health
bill
than
we
do
it
is
free
in
that
there
are
no
deductibles
nor
copayments
two
things
which
i
advocate
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
on
my
pay
stub
manitoba
did
not
collect
at
paycheque
time
but
only
annually
at
income
tax
time
built
into
the
tax
rate
only
fiscal
naifs
will
proclaim
that
its
free
along
with
the
canadian
left
for
that
is
part
of
their
brainwashing
agenda
the
french
do
have
copayments

isnt
the

just
too
big

powerful
to
kill
dismantling
the
health
segment
of
our

industry
would
be
politically
thorny
in
the
quiet
words
of
one
advocate
for
a
national
plan
some
firms
now
sell
more
than
billion
in

theyd
put
up
a
hard
fight
not
only
has
the
industry
grown
eightfold
since
canada
shut
down
its
own
health
insurers
but
our
government
leaves
politicians
more
open
to
lobbyists
than
does
canadas
parliamentary
system
health
insurance
does
exist
in
canada
and
in
western
europe
its
just
that
it
doesnt
cover
basic
care
you
can
opt
out
in
canada
and
germany
but
youll
have
to
go
uninsured
as
a
result
because
there
are
too
few
other
people
that
do
so
ie
no
market
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call

on

for
their

responsibility
in

one

system
bs
writes
there
is
never
any
mention
of
how
much
working
canadians
have
to
pay
in
taxes
for
their
free
health
care
system
oh
really
i
know
that
more
than
of
an
average
daily
workers
salary
goes
towards
taxes
in
canada
mainly
because
of
this
free
health
care
it
looks
like
we
are
pretty
lucky
so
far
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
seperately
on
my
pay
stub
while
im
not
the
only
canadian
who
favours
lower
taxes
and
cutbacks
in
spending
health
insurance
isnt
on
the
table
see
our
polls
a
better
one
might
be
the
july
polls
conducted
for
macleans
our
major
english
newsmagazine
by
decima
research
decima
president
allen
gregg
is
considered
one
of
the
worlds
top
poll
researchers
and
mulroneys
conservatives
have
relied
on
him
to
keep
in
power
in
the
face
of
impossible
election
situations
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
see
this
years
version
due
to
our
library
but
previous
ones
before
the
americans
started
their
assault
and
disinformation
had
shown
satisfaction
at
and
switching
to
an
american
allprivate
system
had
support
within
statistical
noise
the
decima
polls
are
considered
definitive
even
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
personally
i
feel
that
the
universal
health
insurance
approach
used
in
canada
france
and
germany
paying
to
private
health
providers
in
a
nominally
free
market
not
unlike
americas
minus
hmos
depends
a
lot
on
values
in
those
societies
different
from
the
us
the
basic
health
needs
for
life
are
not
viewed
as
market
but
the
insurance
does
allow
the
market
to
address
that
basic
health
care
is
not
viewed
on
the
level
of
ownership
of
a
vcr
as
americans
would
see
it
plenty
of
room
is
left
for
expenditure
of
private
funds
as
extra
insurance
or
as
lastly
there
were
noises
about
how
the
canadian
system
was
not
containing
costs
but
in
fact
their
system
is
currently
bankrupt
please
explain
this
one
hopefully
in
a
way
that

were

at

and
with

is
the

united

bill
clinton
and
id
like
to
welcome
you
to
the
area
and
to
kdka
the
president
thank
you
mike
glad
to
be
here
q
there
are
a
lot
of
things
wed
like
to
talk
about
in
the
brief
amount
of
time
we
have
but
some
news
is
just
breaking
from
los
angeles
i
guess
the
entire
country
has
been
kind
of
holding
their
breath
wondering
whats
going
to
happen
in
the
trial
of
the
four
los
angeles
police
officers
we
just
heard
that
two
of
those
officers
the
sergeant
sergeant
koon
and
officer
powell
have
been
found
guilty
and
two
officers
have
been
found
not
guilty
its
a
situation
thats
been
building
for
over
a
year
since
the
first
trial
and
now
this
trial
and
this
verdict
and
i
wonder
what
your
thoughts
are
this
morning
on
how
you
see
the
situation
in
los
angeles
in
connection
with
your
administration
and
what
youre
trying
to
do
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
think
the
american
people
should
know
that
this
trial
in
my
judgment
is
a
tribute
to
the
work
and
judgment
of
the
jury
as
well
as
to
the
efforts
of
the
federal
government
in
developing
the
case
the
law
under
which
the
officers
were
tried
is
a
complex
one
the
standards
of
proof
are
complicated
the
jury
decided
that
they
would
convict
the
sergeant
who
was
responsible
for
supervising
the
officers
and
the
officer
who
on
the
film
did
most
of
the
beating
the
jury
acquitted
an
officer
who
kicked
rodney
king
but
also
plainly
tried
to
shield
him
from
some
blows
and
another
officer
who
was
a
rookie
no
one
knows
exactly
why
they
did
what
they
did
but
it
appears
that
they
really
tried
to
do
justice
here
they
acknowledged
that
his
civil
rights
were
violated
and
i
think
that
the
american
people
should
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
but
i
hope
now
we
can
begin
to
look
ahead
and
focus
on
three
things
first
of
all
the
importance
of
trying
to
bring
this
country
together
and
not
violate
the
civil
rights
of
any
american
secondly
the
importance
of
renewing
our
fight
against
crime
i
think
its
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
poorest
areas
of
los
angeles
and
many
other
cities
in
this
country
people
may
be
worried
about
police
abuse
but
theyre
even
more
worried
about
crime
its
time
that
we
renewed
our
efforts
to
go
to
community
policing
put
more
police
officers
on
the
street
pass
the
brady
bill
that
would
require
a
waiting
period
before
people
could
buy
a
handgun
and
do
some
other
things
to
reduce
the
vulnerability
of
our
people
to
violence
and
drugs
and
the
last
point
id
like
to
make
is
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
got
to
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
economic
revitalization
of
our
cities
and
other
economicallydistressed
areas
if
you
just
think
about
it
if
everybody
in
los
angeles
who
wanted
a
job
had
one
i
dont
think
wed
have
quite
as
many
problems
as
we
do
and
i
laid
out
a
very
ambitious
program
in
the
campaign
to
try
to
bring
private
investment
and
public
investment
to
bear
in
our
cities
i
have
dispatched
the
commerce
secretary
ron
brown
to
california
to
try
to
come
up
with
some
strategies
for
that
state
because
its
our
biggest
state
with
our
highest
unemployment
rate
which
could
then
be
applied
around
the
country
i
want
to
talk
to
him
and
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
new
head
of
the
naacp
to
reverend
jackson
and
to
several
other
people
and
then
ill
decide
where
to
go
from
here
with
regard
to
los
angeles
and
the
other
cities
of
the
country
q
lets
talk
about
what
brings
you
to
the
pittsburgh
area
today
there
have
been
i
guess
theres
been
a
lot
of
discussion
on
capitol
hill
about
your
stimulus
package
youve
been
locked
in
a
battle
with
the
gop
yesterday
as
you
said
earlier
in
your
radio
address
you
made
some
moves
to
break
that
gridlock
what
brings
you
to
pittsburgh
in
particular
to
allegheny
county
in
particular
to
pennsylvania
with
that
battle
the
president
well
there
are
two
reasons
first
of
all
pittsburgh
allegheny
county
and
pennsylvania
supported
me
in
the
last
election
because
they
wanted
a
new
direction
in
economic
policy
we
have
passed
our
overall
economic
plan
it
gives
the
country
a
very
different
budget
for
the
next
five
years
than
weve
had
in
the
previous
we
reduced
the
deficit
and
at
the
same
time
increased
investment
in
jobs
and
education
and
health
care
in
the
things
that
will
make
us
a
stronger
country
but
in
addition
to
that
i
asked
the
congress
in
the
short
run
to
spend
a
little
more
money
a
modest
amount
of
money
to
create
another
halfmillion
jobs
in
the
next
year
and
a
half
to
try
to
cut
the
unemployment
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
but
also
to
try
to
spark
job
creation
in
the
private
sector
more
the
plan
passed
the
house
it
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
senate
at
the
present
time
all
the
republican
senators
as
a
bloc
are
filibustering
the
bill
that
is
they
wont
let
it
come
to
a
vote
i
believe
that
senator
specter
would
like
to
vote
for
the
bill
and
i
believe
that
senator
dole
the
republican
leader
has
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
a
lot
of
the
republicans
to
stay
hitched
and
theyre
all
saying
that
this
bill
increases
the
deficit
it
doesnt
this
bill
is
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
approved
including
the
republicans
for
this
year
this
bill
is
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
in
the
next
five
years
this
bill
is
designed
to
give
a
jumpstart
to
the
economy
and
i
must
say
a
lot
of
the
republican
senators
that
are
holding
it
up
when
mr
bush
was
president
voted
for
billions
of
dollars
of
emergency
spending
of
just
this
kind
much
of
it
was
totally
unrelated
to
creating
jobs
so
what
im
trying
to
do
is
to
break
this
logjam
ive
held
out
an
olive
branch
ive
offered
a
compromise
but
i
think
that
we
ought
to
try
to
put
some
more
americans
to
work
right
now
to
show
that
were
changing
the
direction
of
the
country
and
thats
the
purpose
of
the
bill
q
have
you
been
in
touch
with
senator
specter
or
his
office
lately
the
president
well
weve
been
trying
to
talk
regularly
to
through
my
white
house
congressional
liaison
operation
to
the
senators
that
we
think
are
open
to
this
senator
specter
senator
damato
from
new
york
senator
jeffords
from
vermont
senator
hatfield
from
oregon
and
five
or
six
others
whom
we
believe
know
we
need
more
jobs
in
this
economy
and
know
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
over
the
life
of
the
budget
i
presented
you
know
it
has
a
lot
of
appeal
to
say
well
weve
got
a
big
deficit
we
shouldnt
increase
it
more
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
in
the
whole
life
of
the
budget
over
the
next
few
years
and
more
importantly
we
have
this
program
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
has
already
approved
for
this
year
and
theyve
done
this
for
years
with
the
republicans
voting
for
it
many
republicans
voting
for
it
for
things
that
werent
nearly
as
important
as
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
so
i
just
hope
that
this
doesnt
become
a
political
issue
it
ought
to
just
be
about
the
people
of
this
country
and
the
need
for
jobs
q
i
have
some
questions
from
people
who
supported
you
and
some
people
who
are
skeptical
about
your
administration
it
has
to
do
with
their
hopes
and
also
with
their
fears
a
lot
of
people
who
supported
you
and
voted
for
you
in
pennsylvania
i
think
some
of
them
are
now
saying
were
glad
we
got
him
in
the
white
house
but
now
look
at
this
incredible
process
he
has
to
go
through
look
at
these
problems
look
at
this
gridlock
and
theyre
beginning
to
wonder
is
this
going
to
work
can
you
pull
it
off
and
of
course
your
skeptics
are
saying
well
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
like
this
the
president
well
what
i
would
id
ask
people
first
of
all
to
remember
that
we
are
frankly
moving
very
fast
the
budget
resolution
that
the
congress
passed
is
the
fastest
they
have
ever
passed
a
budget
resolution
ever
in
history
setting
out
the
next
fiveyear
budget
targets
so
we
are
moving
really
rapidly
and
weve
got
them
working
on
political
reform
welfare
reform
health
care
reform
a
whole
wide
range
of
things
but
its
a
big
operation
you
cant
expect
to
turn
it
around
overnight
it
took
years
to
produce
the
conditions
which
led
to
the
victory
i
received
from
the
people
in
november
and
we
cant
turn
it
around
in
days
but
i
think
were
making
real
real
progress
i
would
urge
the
people
not
to
get
discouraged
were
not
going
to
win
every
battle
and
not
everything
is
going
to
happen
overnight
but
we
are
definitely
moving
and
changing
things

the

good
morning
my
voice
is
coming
to
you
this
morning
through
the
facilities
of
the
oldest
radio
station
in
america
kdka
in
pittsburgh
im
visiting
the
city
to
meet
personally
with
citizens
here
to
discuss
my
plans
for
jobs
health
care
and
the
economy
but
i
wanted
first
to
do
my
weekly
broadcast
with
the
american
people
im
told
this
station
first
broadcast
in
when
it
reported
that
years
presidential
elections
over
the
past
seven
decades
presidents
have
found
ways
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
people
from
whistlestop
tours
to
fireside
chats
to
the
bus
tour
that
i
adopted
along
with
vice
president
gore
in
last
years
campaign
every
saturday
morning
i
take
this
time
to
talk
with
you
my
fellow
americans
about
the
problems
on
your
minds
and
what
im
doing
to
try
and
solve
them
its
my
way
of
reporting
to
you
and
of
giving
you
a
way
to
hold
me
accountable
you
sent
me
to
washington
to
get
our
government
and
economy
moving
after
years
of
paralysis
and
policy
and
a
bad
experiment
with
trickledown
economics
you
know
how
important
it
is
for
us
to
make
bold
comprehensive
changes
in
the
way
we
do
business
we
live
in
a
competitive
global
economy
nations
rise
and
fall
on
the
skills
of
their
workers
the
competitiveness
of
their
companies
the
imagination
of
their
industries
and
the
cooperative
experience
and
spirit
that
exists
between
business
labor
and
government
although
many
of
the
economies
of
the
industrialized
world
are
now
suffering
from
slow
growth
theyve
made
many
of
the
smart
investments
and
the
tough
choices
which
our
government
has
for
too
long
ignored
thats
why
many
of
them
have
been
moving
ahead
and
too
many
of
our
people
have
been
falling
behind
we
have
an
economy
today
that
even
when
it
grows
is
not
producing
new
jobs
weve
increased
the
debt
of
our
nation
by
four
times
over
the
last
years
and
we
dont
have
much
to
show
for
it
we
know
that
wages
of
most
working
people
have
stopped
rising
that
most
people
are
working
longer
work
weeks
and
that
too
many
families
can
no
longer
afford
the
escalating
cost
of
health
care
but
we
also
know
that
given
the
right
tools
the
right
incentives
and
the
right
encouragement
our
workers
and
businesses
can
make
the
kinds
of
products
and
profits
our
economy
needs
to
expand
opportunity
and
to
make
our
communities
better
places
to
live
in
many
critical
products
today
americans
are
the
low
cost
high
quality
producers
our
task
is
to
make
sure
that
we
create
more
of
those
kinds
of
jobs
just
two
months
ago
i
gave
congress
my
plan
for
longterm
jobs
and
economic
growth
it
changes
the
old
priorities
in
washington
and
puts
our
emphasis
where
it
needs
to
be
on
peoples
real
needs
on
increasing
investments
and
jobs
and
education
on
cutting
the
federal
deficit
on
stopping
the
waste
which
pays
no
dividends
and
redirecting
our
precious
resources
toward
investment
that
creates
jobs
now
and
lays
the
groundwork
for
robust
economic
growth
in
the
future
these
new
directions
passed
the
congress
in
record
time
and
created
a
new
sense
of
hope
and
opportunity
in
our
country
then
the
jobs
plan
i
presented
to
congress
which
would
create
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
most
of
them
in
the
private
sector
in
and
passed
the
house
of
representatives
it
now
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
united
states
senate
but
its
been
held
up
by
a
filibuster
of
a
minority
in
the
senate
just
senators
they
blocked
a
vote
that
they
know
would
result
in
the
passage
of
our
bill
and
the
creation
of
jobs
the
issue
isnt
politics
the
issue
is
people
millions
of
americans
are
waiting
for
this
legislation
and
counting
on
it
counting
on
us
in
washington
but
the
jobs
bill
has
been
grounded
by
gridlock
i
know
the
american
people
are
tired
of
business
as
usual
and
politics
as
usual
i
know
they
dont
want
us
to
spin
or
wheels
they
want
the
recovery
to
get
moving
so
i
have
taken
a
first
step
to
break
this
gridlock
and
gone
the
extra
mile
yesterday
i
offered
to
cut
the
size
of
this
plan
by
percent
from
billion
to
billion
its
not
what
id
hoped
for
with
million
americans
looking
for
fulltime
work
i
simply
cant
let
the
bill
languish
when
i
know
that
even
a
compromise
bill
will
mean
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
for
our
people
the
mandate
is
to
act
to
achieve
change
and
move
the
country
forward
by
taking
this
initiative
in
the
face
of
an
unrelenting
senate
talkathon
i
think
we
can
respond
to
your
mandate
and
achieve
a
significant
portion
of
our
original
goals
first
we
want
to
keep
the
programs
as
much
as
possible
that
are
needed
to
generate
jobs
and
meet
human
needs
including
highway
and
road
construction
summer
jobs
for
young
people
immunization
for
children
construction
of
waste
water
sites
and
aid
to
small
businesses
we
also
want
to
keep
funding
for
extended
unemployment
compensation
benefits
for
people
who
have
been
unemployed
for
a
long
time
because
the
economy
isnt
creating
jobs
second
ive
recommended
that
all
the
other
programs
in
the
bill
be
cut
acrosstheboard
by
a
little
more
than
percent
and
third
ive
recommended
a
new
element
in
this
program
to
help
us
immediately
start
our
attempt
to
fight
against
crime
by
providing
million
for
cities
and
towns
to
rehire
police
officers
who
lost
their
jobs
during
the
recession
and
put
them
back
to
work
protecting
our
people
im
also
going
to
fight
for
a
tough
crime
bill
because
the
people
of
this
country
need
it
and
deserve
it
now
the
people
who
are
filibustering
this
bill
the
republican
senators
say
they
wont
vote
for
it
because
it
increases
deficit
spending
because
theres
extra
spending
this
year
that
hasnt
already
been
approved
that
sounds
reasonable
doesnt
it
heres
what
they
dont
say
this
program
is
more
than
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
over
my
fiveyear
budget
and
this
budget
is
well
within
the
spending
limits
already
approved
by
the
congress
this
year
its
amazing
to
me
that
many
of
these
same
senators
who
are
filibustering
the
bill
voted
during
the
previous
administration
for
billions
of
dollars
of
the
same
kind
of
emergency
spending
and
much
of
it
was
not
designed
to
put
the
american
people
to
work
this
is
not
about
deficit
spending
we
have
offered
a
plan
to
cut
the
deficit
this
is
about
where
your
priorities
are
on
people
or
on
politics
keep
in
mind
that
our
jobs
bill
is
paid
for
dollar
for
dollar
it
is
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
and
its
the
soundest
investment
we
can
now
make
for
ourselves
and
our
children
i
urge
all
americans
to
take
another
look
at
this
jobs
and
investment
program
to
consider
again
the
benefits
for
all
of
us
when
weve
helped
make
more
american
partners
working
to
ensure
the
future
of
our
nation
and
the
strength
of
our
economy
you
know
if
every
american
who
wanted
a
job
had
one
we
wouldnt
have
a
lot
of
the
other
problems
we
have
in
this
country
today
this
bill
is
not
a
miracle
its
a
modest
first
step
to
try
to
set
off
a
job
creation
explosion
in
this
country
again
but
its
a
step
we
ought
to
take
and
it
is
fully
paid
for
over
the
life
of
our
budget
tell
your
lawmakers
what
you
think
tell
them
how
important
the
bill
is
if
it
passes
well
all
be

are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with

government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
well
let
me
help
by
explaining
the
difference
between
a
linited
government
and
a
failed
government
a
limited
government
has
its
powers
clearly
circumscribed
but
is
fully
capable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
within
those
circumscribed
areas
a
failed
government
is
incapable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
except
sporadicly
two
completely
different
beasts
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the

their

the

obviously
worthwhile
the

however
does
not
call
for
this
assessment
it
assumes
that
the
costs
of
regulation
of
any
kind
always
outweigh
its
benefits
this
approach
avoids
all

it
strikes
many

as
dogmatic
to

on
a

is
worthwhile
let
me
suggest
that
this
is
not
an
option
regulators
regulate
its
what
they
do
im
not
sure
why
you
dont
consider
it
an
option
no
one
suggests
that
such
analysis
should
be
left
to
regulators
in
fact
the

provides
just
such
a
costbenefit
approach
to
the

of

libertarians
would
do

learn
more
about

it
might
be
possible
to
pass
an
amendment
which
would
prevent
any
liscensing
laws
from
being
valid
assuming
you
could
convince
people
that
it
would
overall
be
a
good
idea
eliminating
the
liscensing
laws
which
serve
no
good
purpose
the
vast
majority
of
them
while
maintaining
the
worthwhile
ones
assuming
there
are
any
is
not
feasible
sorry
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
the
only
feasible
approach
what
is
not
feasible
is
a
wholesale
attack
on
all
government
regulation
and
licensing
that
treats
cutting
hair
and
practicing
medicine
as
equivalent
tasks
i
have
no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical
care
education
national
defense
or
local
police
that
suggests
a
free
market
can
provide
a
more
effective
efficient
means
of
accomplishing
social
objectives
than
is
provided
through
statist
approaches
with
some
notable
exceptions
however
i
do
not
see
such
nittygritty
worthwhile
analysis
being
carried
out
by
selfprofessed
libertarians
jsh
i
note
that
the
above
examples
tend
to
be
among
the
few
government
areas
likely
to
win
some
approval
among
libertarians
anyway
actually
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
above
that
strike
me
as
generating
substantial
support
among
libertarians
are
police
and
defense
it
is
an
interesting
aside
that
as
committed
as
libertarians
claim
to
be
to
a
principle
of
noncoercion
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
that
they
frequently
support
involve
hiring
people
with
gunshmmm
the
most
objectionable
government
expenditures
are
entitlements
which
also
are
the
biggest
certain
individuals
will
suggest
that
these
should
be
considered
defense
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
a
sort
of
danegeld
to
wouldbe

i
personally
dont

maybe
ive

we
cant

what
phill
really
means
because
hes
obviously
using
arguments
designed
to
convince
i
make
no
secret
of
what
i
am
up
to
i
have
stated
explicitly
in
posts
that
i
am
a
political
propagandist
on
numerous
occasions
anyone
posting
to
this
group
who
is
not
probably
has
the
wrong
group
for
example
i
have
on
numerous
occasions
stated
quite
clearly
that
i
beleive
that
certain
factions
of
the
gun
lobby
are
the
worst
possible
advocates
of
their
cause
and
i
am
prepared
to
do
anything
in
my
power
to
provide
them
with
a
platform
because
they
can
convince
people
far
better
than
i
could
hope
that
many
people
with
a
fixation
on
lethal
weapons
are
dangerous
and
derranged
if
you
happen
to
know
a
political
position
which
does
not
have
people
advocating
it
who
do
more
harm
than
good
please
point
it
out
some
people
have
even
accused
me
of
inventing
such
advocates
purely
for
the
purpose
of
having
them
trash
a
set
of
political
views
in
fact
this
would
be
a
futile
tactic
because
i
could
never
hope
to
invent
a
character
as
dangerous
as
sybokathenaedu
a
man
who
i
quite
seriously
believe
to
be
mentaly
ill
and
a
potential
psychopath
unfortunately
the
local
sherifs
office
have
informed
me
that
they
are
unable
to
act
untill
he
attacks
someone
one
of
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
requiring
proof
on
the
part
of
the
government
before
they
may
take
action
against
citizens
and
part
of
the
reason
some
of
us
believe
weapons
should
be
available
so
if
you
were
to
ask
me
what
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
from
this
current
argument
on
the
absolute
sanctity
of
the
us
constitution
what
would
i
answer
we
are
not
arguing
the
absolute
sanctity
of
the
us
constitution
in
fact
the
fillibuster
were
talking
about
isnt
in
the
constitution
i
objected
to
your
suggestion
that
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
exercise
the
power
it
was
clearly
given
firstly
i
see
that
the
current
us
political
scene
like
the
uk
political
scene
has
become
tied
to
special
interests
rather
than
chase
the
convenient
caricatures
put
about
by
the
media
and
polititians
themselves
for
this
gay
rights
cmapaigners
environmentalists
zionists
ie
jews
foreign
lobbyists
whatever
voting
power
they
have
etc
i
sugest
that
you
look
at
who
is
really
benefiting
the
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
it
is
the
major
corporations
owned
by
the
ultrawealthy
that
have
benefited
regan
and
bush
created
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
welfare
state
for
the
rich
ill
point
out
again
that
reagan
only
had
a
republican
majority
in
the
senate
during
his
first
term
and
his
coalition
in
the
house
came
apart
at
about
the
same
time
bush
never
had
any
real
support
in
congress
the
real
point
is
that
everybody
everywhere
got
their
pork
from
the
big
corporations
to
the
guy
i
saw
last
night
leaving
a
convenience
store
with
an
armful
of
junkfood
hed
bought
with
food
stamps
he
spent
more
in
food
stamps
on
junk
than
i
make
in
a
week
and
im
not
on
government
assitance
money
was
diverted
from
programs
addressing
social
needs
and
poured
into
the
weapons
industry
in
the
form
of
cost
plus
profits
contracts
lessee
lets
pull
out
the
old
almanac
in
total
us
government
budget
outlays
were
billion
dollars
in
est
they
were
trillion
dollars
an
increase
of
approx
billion
dollars
in
national
defense
cost
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
and
increase
of
billion
dollars
that
leaves
an
increase
of
billion
dollars
unaccounted
for
this
represented
an
increase
of
in
income
security
which
includes
retirement
programs
housing
assitance
and
unemployment
benefits
and
i
believe
welfare
cost
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
or
more
than
national
defense
started
this
represented
an
increase
of
in
the
federal
government
spent
billion
dollars
on
medicare
in
they
spent
billion
dollars
an
increase
of
in
the
feds
spent
billion
dollars
on
housing
credits
and
subsidies
of
that
like
in
it
was
billion
in
health
care
services
and
research
was
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
agriculture
up
billion
to
billion
science
up
billion
to
billion
resource
conservation
up
billion
to
billion
education
up
billion
to
billion
veteran
benefits
up
billion
to
billion
trasnportation
up
billion
to
billion
about
the
only
things
i
see
which
was
seriously
decreased
was
under
the
energy
category
primarily
under
supply
and
community
development
in
the
area
of
disaster
relief
and
between
the
two
of
them
represent
a
loss
of
less
than
billion
dollars
where
was
this
huge
diversion
in
order
to
rectify
this
situation
there
must
be
constitutional
revision
not
thats
a
stretch
if
the
current
government
was
pushed
by
the
president
to
create
this
mess
wouldnt
one
expect
it
to
begin
to
equalize
once
the
pressure
is
gone
secondly
the
form
of
this
revision
must
take
account
of
the
changed
circumsatnces
of
the
role
of
the
federal
government
only
assuming
that
the
new
role
is
a
positive
role
we
want
to
continue
i
see
very
little
positive
about
it
the
constitution
cannot
be
used
to
frustrate
the
democratic
process
the
constitution
was
designed
to
frustrate
the
democratic
process
so
that
the
voters
could
be
absolutely
sure
they
were
getting
what
they
wanted
by
the
time
it
happened
nor
do
i
see
putting
the
brakes
on
the
democratic
process
an
inherently
bad
thing
califronias
riding
the
edge
and
every
time
they
pull
their
ballot
initiative
nonsense
it
gets
worse
if
the
peoplr
want
to
have
welfare
spending
by
the
federal
government
they
will
have
it
sometimes
or
perhaps
most
of
the
time
the
people
should
be
told
no
and
pointed
to
their
local
government
attempting
to
prevent
this
through
constitutional
trickery
only
leads
to
the
constitution
being
brought
into
disrepute
phill
would
you
do
me
the
very
great
favor
of
repeating
that
in
talkpoliticsguns
methods
will
always
be
found
to
bypass
such
provisions
and
once
the
government
gets
used
to
bypassing
those
provisions
they
will
bypass
the
others
up
to
the
first
ammendment
cute
we
can
eliminate
violations
of
the
law
by
eliminating
the
law
this
is
a
major
reason
why
the
right
to
own
guns
should
be
excluded
the
implication
that
this
right
is
equal
to
the
right
to
free
speech
is
dangerous
free
speech
alone
is
dangerous
phill
people
know
that
mass
ownership
of
lethal
weapons
causes
thousands
of
murders
a
year
the
dangerous
conclusion
they
may
reach
is
that
the
first
ammendment
may
also
be
the
same
dangerous
mistake
ok
phill
all
you
gotta
show
me
is
a
clear
pattern
of
reduction
in
homicide
rates
across
several
countries
and
thatll
be
it
not
current
mind
you
reduction
note
however
that
this
is
not
the
slippery
slope
argument
it
is
because
the
right
freedom
of
speech
has
been
chained
to
the
privilege
to
own
weaponry
that
the
danger
arises
the
advocates
of
this
pivilege
must
not
be
allowed
to
chain
freedom
of
speech
to
their
cause
such
that
if
they
fall
freedom
of
speech
falls
as
well
such
actions
are
not
the
actions
of
people
genuinely
interested
in
freedom
whos
chaining
anything
to
freedom
of
speech
by
calling
it
a
freedom
thirdly
and
most
importantly
i
want
to
discover
a
mechanism
wherby
i
can
engender
intellectual
debate
as
opposed
to
totemic
debate
i
consider
the
grave
threat
to
civilisation
to
be
the
loss
of
the
ability
to
reason
about
the
political
debate
at
anything
other
than
the
superficial
level
the
objection
i
raise
to
your
basing
your
case
entirely
on
the
assertion
of
the
supremacy
of
the
us
constitution
is
that
the
currency
of
your
argument
is
limited
to
the
currency
of
the
totem
upon
which
it
is
based
the
danger
of
totems
is
that
they
can
be
reinterpreted
in
different
ways
by
different
people
phill
youre
a
master
of
subtly
changing
the
subject
i
havent
based
my
argument
against
raw
democracy
on
the
constitution
ive
tried
to
explain
why
it
isnt
a
good
idea
the
only
time
ive
referred
to
the
constitution
is
to
point
out
it
doesnt
contain
the
restrictions
on
the
veto
and
the
senate
you
appear
to
believe
were
meant
but
just
didnt
make
it
in
there
the
constitution
doesnt
contain
the
fillibuster
rule
i
only
believe
that
the
rule
is
a
good
idea
you
cnt
dismiss
that
as
venerating
the
constitution
because
it
isnt
in
the
constitution

weird
al
subject
re
race
and
violence
joe
as
usual
this
issue
of
dysfunction
of
bad
values
of
messed
up
culture
is
easily
embraced
by
non
african
americans
when
it
comes
to
explaining
problems
in
our
community
from
your
post
you
apparently
find
the
idea
that
something
is
wrong
with
african
americans
valuewise
culture
wise
or
something
very
appealing
i
never
cease
to
be
amazed
at
how
eager
non
african
americans
are
to
embrace
theories
about
our
problems
which
basically
assert
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
the
socioeconomic
factors
which
we
know
help
to
produce
high
crime
levels
like
poverty
which
exists
among
us
in
large
proportion
i
mean
when
it
comes
to
discussion
of
african
american
problems
we
somehow
become
exempt
from
all
these
types
of
factors
and
the
problem
is
laid
at
the
doorstep
of
some
neboulous
dysfunction
we
supposedly
have
but
nobody
attributes
crime
amongst
white
americans
to
dysfunction
no
that
has
socioeconomic
factors
to
it
but
for
africa
americans
its
gotta
be
a
dysfunction
basically
i
think
this
tendency
for
non
african
americans
to
believe
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
exists
because
non
african
americans
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
possiblility
that
the
society
is
deeply
biased
against
african
americans
and
that
this
is
about
of
the
problem
it
could
not
possible
be
that
the
society
is
so
deeply
racist
and
structured
against
us
that
this
has
a
very
effective
negative
effect
on
us
no
something
is
wrong
with
us
non
african
americans
are
quick
to
disregard
what
we
have
to
say
because
they
are
so
busy
trying
to
find
something
wrong
with
us
instead
of
taking
a
good
hard
look
at
the
thing
we
say
are
doing
us
damage

would
get

it

steve
hendricks
writes
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
without
having
a
complete
answer
to
this
question
i
should
think
it
obvious
that
the
first
step
should
be
to
convince
people
this
would
be
a
desirable
result
there
are
still
quite
a
lot
of
people
who
feel
that
the
command
economies
of
eastern
europe
failed
due
to
corruption
rather
than
essential
weaknesses
of
caommand
economies
and
you
still
have
a
majority
in
this
nation
that
favors
keeping
unenforced
and
unenforcible
laws
on
the
books
in
order
to
send
a
signal
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
feel
this
way
in
the
first
place
constant
combat
isnt
particularly
conducive
to
intellectual
theorizing
also
they
tend
to
get
invaded
before
they
can
come
to
anything
like
a
stable
society
anyway
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the
rest
of
us
find
their
analysis
to
be
simplistic
umm
is
there
any
distinction
between
vague
and
elastic
in
this
context
aside
from
one
having
a
more
positive
connotation
than
the
other
at
any

if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principle
no
in
practice
yes
in
principle
no
that
they
had
less
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
less
power
the
british
parliament
in
principle
has
absolute
power
so
does
the
monarch
much
of
the
stability
of
the
system
rests
on
what
is
not
defined
clearly
in
the
case
of
a
clear
abuse
by
one
side
or
the
other
the
other
side
can
act
to
remedy
the
situation
two
institutions
with
absolute
power
cute
lets
talk
practicality
shall
we
if
the
monarch
tried
to
do
something
what
would
happen
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfare
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidy
motto
they
would
be
better
placed
as
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
state
money
being
handed
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
governmental
ladder
the
less
actual
need
matters
because
political
power
can
be
concentrated
at
higher
levels
while
people
with
less
cloud
only
find
themselves
reduced
to
in
effectiveness
that
was
not
my
point
but
you
illustrated
the
problem
very
well
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
states
with
pork
defense
contracts
agricultural
subsidies
etc
or
to
be
precise
of
the
states
since
you
need
to
beat
the
filibuster
then
why
not
simply
leave
new
yorks
education
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinved
that
there
is
any
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capable
of
educating
its
own
children
if
thats
what
they
want
to
do
the
point
is
of
redistribution
of
cash
from
the
poor
areas
of
the
ecconomy
to
the
rich
ones
i
am
contending
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
which
does
not
have
ample
wealth
if
they
choose
to
spend
it
to
run
a
perfectly
acceptable
education
system
i
further
contend
that
the
amount
of
money
being
spent
now
is
more
then
sufficient
but
is
being
spent
badly
or
vice
versa
if
you
arent
a
republican
so
tell
me
phill
were
the
republicans
also
responsible
for
some
of
the
huge
increases
in
social
programs
or
were
they
only
responsible
for
what
you
dont
like
i
contend
it
is
congress
which
is
to
blame
democrat
and
republican
alike
if
society
simply
writes
off
any
areas
of
the
country
that
is
ecconomically
weak
you
end
up
with
a
basket
case
ecconomy
there
are
inevitable
cycles
in
any
business
some
of
these
act
in
phase
to
produce
the
business
cycle
others
are
countercyclic
localities
can
experience
boom
to
bust
cycles
outside
the
national
trend
to
produce
a
strong
ecconomy
you
need
to
ensure
that
the
bust
areas
do
not
fall
bellow
the
level
where
they
cannot
be
ecconomically
rebuilt
most
of
our
worst
areas
are
still
better
off
than
most
of
europe
in
any
case
were
talking
about
education
if
the
industry
in
an
area
collapses
the
us
as
a
whole
still
has
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
children
in
that
area
get
a
good
education
in
some
areas
of
the
us
schools
are
closing
halfway
through
the
year
for
lack
of
money
yes
i
live
in
once
such
area
youre
woefully
ignorant
of
the
situation
at
the
same
time
some
of
tennessees
school
districts
are
closing
down
the
governor
asked
for
million
dollars
for
bicentenntial
celebration
license
plats
in
almost
the
same
breath
he
wanted
to
raise
unemployment
compensation
and
reduce
taxes
which
paid
into
it
i
dont
know
about
the
rest
of
the
country
but
our
education
problems
stem
directly
from
two
problems
neither
of
which
are
a
lack
of
money
in
the
state
btw
tennessee
is
considered
a
tax
heaven
and
our
economy
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
country
i
see
a
correlation
what
money
we
spend
goes
primarly
to
administration
the
average
administrator
makes
two
and
a
half
times
what
the
average
teacher
makes
and
sucks
up
an
enormous
amount
of
revenue
and
the
governor
is
making
a
concerted
effort
to
create
an
education
crisis
in
order
to
push
for
his
pet
income
tax
some
of
the
most
idiotic
programs
get
funded
like
state
funds
for
new
art
in
the
county
seat
while
schools
are
closing
its
not
a
lack
of
funds
its
an
unwillingness
to
spend
them
on
what
is
more
appropriate
education
is
the
parental
hotbutton
education
is
always
the
first
to
but
cut
because
its
easier
to
get
people
to
pay
for
their
children
than
ugly
art
the
us
constitution
is
a
nutsandbolts
document
the
delcaration
of
independence
was
the
highbrow
reasoning
there
are
a
couple
of
other
examples
though
such
as
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
tax
and
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
grant
permits
both
in
article
i
section
the
declaration
on
independence
cam
a
decade
earlier
and
has
not
a
line
of
justification
for
the
us
constitution
you
could
argue
that
it
went
into
the
broad
concepts
but
little
more
it
spoke
very
eloquently
on
government
being
based
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
in
fact
it
is
little
more
than
a
protracted
whinge
more
to
do
with
the
price
of
tea
than
the
design
of
a
government
it
would
be
a
pretty
daft
idea
for
a
bunch
of
guys
to
sit
arround
designing
the
structure
of
the
new
government
while
the
little
matter
of
the
british
army
remained
to
be
settled
they
did
it
anyway
the
continental
congress
had
its
own
set
of
bylaws
it
wasnt
quite
a
government
but
a
means
of
making
decisions
had
to
be
created
however
low
george
washingtons
opinion
of
them
were
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believe
the
veto
has
become
something
it
wasnt
intended
however
i
also
believe
it
is
inevitable
considering
the
congress
own
abuse
of
their
power
to
make
bills
say
whatever
they
want
them
to
say
unlike
most
people
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worrying
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessitates
its
abuse
the
congress
is
the
most
democratic
body
in
the
whole
system
allow
me
again
to
speak
heresy
against
the
holy
democratic
orders
so
what
the
government
was
built
with
a
very
nondemocratic
presidency
with
fairly
broad
powers
including
the
veto
it
has
not
only
the
fairest
system
of
election
but
the
two
year
term
means
that
the
members
have
always
got
a
recent
mandate
yes
and
the
senate
was
intended
to
act
as
a
balance
to
this
too
much
democracy
was
intentionally
avoided
it
was
considered
a
good
thing
to
place
nondemocratic
blocks
to
impulsive
action
on
the
other
hand
if
the
period
of
election
were
to
be
made
years
in
antiphase
to
the
presidential
cycle
there
would
be
much
less
dependence
on
fund
raising
from
special
interests
than
there
is
at
present
so
long
as
congress
has
something
to
sell
people
will
pay
for
it
most
congressmen
rake
in
more
money
than
they
need
why
not
what
is
inherently
wrong
with
biasing
the
system
against
action
historically
governemnt
action
in
the
us
when
dealing
with
issues
with
a
bare
minority
and
a
large
minority
have
not
been
successful
when
youre
in
a
position
of
imposing
federal
power
on
diverse
people
why
should
the
federal
government
not
have
to
got
through
something
more
than
a
bare
majority
in
other
words
david
thinks
that
the
reactionaries
should
need
only
votes
while
progressives
should
need
no
if
the
progressives
dont
want
the
reactionaries
to
move
backward
they
get
the
same
benefit
of
the
states
is
a
lot
of
people
and
historically
laws
with
that
sort
of
minority
arent
very
effective
especially
since
it
is
usually
geographically
concentrated
when
wielding
the
federal
big
stick
i
dont
see
why
they
shouldnt
have
to
make
a
better
argument
than
more
people
than
not
agree
now
we
know
why
nobody
calls
the
republicans
democrats
im
not
a
republican
im
a
republican
and
no
im
neither
a
democrat
nor
a
democrat
now
ive
asked
several
times
and
all
youve
done
is
answer
it
isnt
democratic
which
i
knew
before
i
said
it
why
should
it
be
democratic
we
dont
have
a
true
direct
democracy
and
few
people
advocate
one
why
then
is
this
other
modification
of
democracy
to
bias
it
against
action
so
much
worse

eight
myths

pt

in

gary
l
dare
writes
the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the
fees
lack
of
defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of
malpractice
is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most
expensive
approach
of
pure
insurance
then
why
do
we
really
need
national
health
insurance
then
wouldnt
it
just
make
more
sense
to
find
some
way
to
cut
down
on
the
cost
of
malpractice
insurance
and
maybe
thats
not
such
a
good
thing
i
also
read
somewhere
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
in
canada
to
litigate
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suits
are
nearly
impossible
and
you
cant
sue
the
provincial
health
officials
at
all
part
of
the
deal
for
using
the
allinsurance
approach
like
the
french
and
germans
do
hey
why
dont
they
criticize
france
and
germany
is
it
because
too
many
people
take
french
and
german
in
college
to
make
the
accusations
stick
was
to
preserve
the
doctors
independance
since
the
provincial
wings
of
the
cma
are
the
ones
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedule
hikes
are
presented
the
politicallybent
doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike
in
socialized
medicine
approaches
like
britains
national
health
service
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
this
they
have
enough
power
as
it
is
ask
most
americans
whether
theyd
like
the
doctors
lobby
to
get
more
powerful
for
nonlife
threatening
things
market
arguments
adequately
cover
why
certain
procedures
are
in
scarcer
demand
i
have
md
friends
who
cant
make
a
living
as
specialists
back
in
manitoba
not
due
to
the
insurance
rates
but
because
they
wont
get
enough
customers
the
cma
medical
monopolys
grip
on
doctors
licencing
as
in
the
us
aside
so
they
must
move
to
larger
places
however
this
does
not
refute
debunking
of
waiting
lines
for
urgent
and
routine
care
as
has
been
done
in
the
us
by
consumers
reports
health
policy
studies
cited
by
prof
dennis
e
shea
on
usenet
cnn
nyt
etc
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
theoretically
its
limited
to
service
personnel
but
some
studies
ive
heard
about
have
suggested
that
about
half
the
patients
there
are
civilians
who
not
only
have
connections
but
arent
urgent
at
all
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
the
figure
of
percentage
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistry
and
optometry
were
included
in
the
accounting
maybe
canada
spends
proportionately
just
as
much
on
health
care
as
we
do
of
course
the
one
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
canadafrancegermany
case
private
insurance
offloaded
the
basic
coverage
to
the
public
sector
they
realized
they
were
keeping
lowriskhighprofit
extra
insurance
for
things
like
privatesemiprivate
rooms
vs
ward
accomodation
dental
glasses
etc
for
corporate
or
personal
benefits
theyll
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
if
you
want
to
be
covered
for
basic
care
at
that
point
they
wouldnt
even
consider
a
voucher
approach
to
broker
the
universal
coverage
and
sell
policies
to
make
up
the
difference
in
the
federal
guidelines
and
market
stuff
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warned
ontarians
a
few
years
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossborder
shopping
in
such
huge
numbers
the
services
they
expect
from
the
province
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
years
fortunately
for
them
and
less
fortunately
for
the
retailers
here
in
western
new
york
the
canadian
dollar
went
back
to
a
more
realistic
value
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
what
would
happen
if
his
warning
turned
out
to
be
the
truth
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
wouldnt
free
care
encourage
people
to
run
to
the
doctor
for
every
ache
and
pain
people
who
get
free
treatment
do
go
to
the
doctor
and
hospital
about
a
third
more
often
than
those
who
have
to
pay
a
share
of
their
medical
bills
still
canadians
who
pay
nothing
at
the
doctors
have
a
lower
perperson
health
bill
than
we
do
it
is
free
in
that
there
are
no
deductibles
nor
copayments
two
things
which
i
advocate
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
on
my
pay
stub
manitoba
did
not
collect
at
paycheque
time
but
only
annually
at
income
tax
time
built
into
the
tax
rate
only
fiscal
naifs
will
proclaim
that
its
free
along
with
the
canadian
left
for
that
is
part
of
their
brainwashing
agenda
would
that
it
were
free
americans
would
start
another
revolution
if
they
had
to
pay
taxes
at
canadian
rates
isnt
the
private
health
insurance
industry
just
too
big
and
powerful
to
kill
dismantling
the
health
segment
of
our
insurance
industry
would
be
politically
thorny
in
the
quiet
words
of
one
advocate
for
a
national
plan
some
firms
now
sell
more
than
billion
in
health
insurance
theyd
put
up
a
hard
fight
not
only
has
the
industry
grown
eightfold
since
canada
shut
down
its
own
health
insurers
but
our
government
leaves
politicians
more
open
to
lobbyists
than
does
canadas

health
insurance
does
exist
in
canada
and
in
western
europe
its
just
that
it
doesnt
cover
basic
care
you
can
opt
out
in
canada
and
germany
but
youll
have
to
go
uninsured
as
a
result
because
there
are
too
few
other
people
that
do
so
ie
no
market
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing
routine
low
cost
parts
of
that
provinces
public
health
insurance
plan
again
i
doubt
americans
would
like
giving
the
insurance
companies
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insurers
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinces
and
the
federal
government
years
ago
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
public
system
going
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterwards
they
could
clean
up
okay
this
sort
of
contradicts
what
i
said
higher
up
but
its
another
possibility
theyd
have
an
added
bonus
when
arguing
against
government
involvement
in
their
industryas
they
could
then
point
to
its
failure
instead
of
just
citing
theoretical
principles

whether
you

dont

and
military

agree
that
the
quality

is
superior
with

no

because
im

agree
that
economic

leads
to
poverty
and
from
there
to
social
and

you
go
read
your

again
poverty
is
the
main
engine
of
social
instability
in
this
context
well
put
aside
religious
turmoil
mass
migrations
etc
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
poverty
is
imperfectly
related
to
social
and
political
instability
while
economic
inequality
is
much
more
strongly
related
in
virtually
all
major
revolutions
including
england
the
puritan
revolution
france
russia
and
china
the
revolutions
occurred
as
economies
were
undergoing
substantial
long
term
growth
and
poverty
was
declining
what
sets
off
revolutions
is
massive
inequality
coupled
with
a
perception
on
the
part
of
those
at
the
bottom
that
social
change
is
possible
if
poverty
were
the
main
engine
of
social

this

would

gee
jim
if
youll
check
the

youll
find

welfaredo
ordain

this

im
surprised
you
missed
it
its
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at
least
through
the
preamble
you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
was
a
good
try
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advice
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
does
read
as
you
have
quoted
but
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a
binding
part
of
the
constitution
and
carries
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortured
paragraph
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
passages
in
the
english
language
witness
the
legions
of
blowhards
like
yourself
who
think
those
vague
flowery
phrases
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
really
believe
that
a
politician
only
has
to
give
lip
service
to
promoting
the
general
welfare
to
be
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of
the
constitution
article
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxesto
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
just
to
make
sure
youve
got
the
point
lets
do
a
little
experiment
what
if
the
constitution
read
as
follows
preamble
we
the
people
to
promote
the
general
welfare
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
constitution
the
federal
government
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
only
to
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
nation
but
as
noted
above
the
constitution
doesnt
say
that
does
it
the
government
would
not
then
have
two
functions
defense
and
welfare
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in
article
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions

is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most
expensive
approach
of
pure

and
maybe
thats
not
such
a
good
thing
i
also
read
somewhere
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
in
canada
to
litigate
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suits
are
nearly
impossible
and
you
cant
sue
the
provincial
health
officials
at
all
since
our
doctors
are
private
and
the
system
is
just
an
insurance
plan
litigation
would
not
involve
the
insurance
fund
our
lawyers
do
not
work
on
contingency
so
that
if
you
were
to
sue
for
malpractice
then
youd
better
be
sure
of
winning
to
cover
your
fees
likewise
if
you
were

doctor
and
subject
of
a
suit
its
time
to
sweat
since
the
provincial
wings
of
the
cma

the
ones
that
go

when
the

schedule
hikes
are

the

doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the

would
grow

strength
rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike
in
socialized
medicine
approaches
like
britains
national
health
service
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
this
they
have
enough
power
as
it
is
ask
most
americans
whether
theyd
like
the
doctors
lobby
to
get
more
powerful
a
few
weeks
ago
the
president
of
the
canadian
ma
wrote
a
letter
to
the
nyt
to
decry
a
lobbyists
advert
repeating
the
same
old
trash
this
is
significant
because
the
ama
and
the
cma
are
interlinked
organizations
and
he
would
not
have
done
it
without
the
approval
of
his
ama
cronies
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
theoretically
its
limited
to
service
personnel
but
some
studies
ive
heard
about
have
suggested
that
about
half
the
patients
there
are
civilians
who
not
only
have
connections
but
arent
urgent
at
all
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
bethesda
naval
hospital
since
not
all
hospitals
can
provide
everything
maybe
they
have
some
stuff
that
others
dont
ottawas
population
is
only
a
quarter
million
if
you
include
the
surrounding
counties
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
people
of
influence
will
get
their
way
in
any
system
american
or
european
its
the
golden
rule
he
who
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
as
for
annual
budgets
those
are
actually
annual
grants
for
facilities
eg
mops
pans
etc
given
to
hospitals
of
which
most
are
private
nonprofit
foundations
btw
i
have
no
problem
with
having
aggressive
forprofit
hospitals
like
the
french
who
use
our
approach
but
in
the
paris
region
they
have
almost
as
many
people
as
canada
does
so
their
market
is
much
more
diverse
the
rest
has
to
be
made
up
for
by
billings
from
patients
who
use
their
services
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
the
figure
of
percentage
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistry
and
optometry
were
included
in
the
accounting
maybe
canada
spends
proportionately
just
as
much
on
health
care
as
we
do
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
and
are
compiled
use
the
same
methods
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
how
they
are
collecting
premiums
and
im
an
advocate
of
having
copayments
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
in
order
to
make
it
look
more
like
the
real
insurance
that
it
is
the
private
doctors
and
hospitals
will
still
be
there
after
the
insurance
hypothically
disappears
as
they
were
there
before
it
appeared
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warned
ontarians
a
few
years
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossborder
shopping
in
such
huge
numbers
the
services
they
expect
from
the
province
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
years
for
one
thing
i
think
that
bob
rae
is
an
idiot
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
most
of
ohip
comes
from
separate
premiums
on
your
paycheck
if
you
are
a
player
he
wants
to
spend
our
money
on
other
things
than
the
health
insurance
our
high
taxes
are
high
for
other
spending
but
health
insurance
which
is
separate
and
optional
and
it
is
being
spent
in
a
nonpartisan
manner
by
every
party
ohip
is
just
a
health
insurance
plan
it
does
not
provide
any
kind
of
health
care
that
is
up
to
you
and
your
private
doctors
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
some
of
the
companies
providing
extra
insurance
are
subsidiaries
of
american
companies
and
their
parents
provide
full
insurance
down
here
regardless
all
firms
up
north
can
easily
turn
on
cable
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firms
are
doing
by
being
involved
in
basic
coverage
the
private
firms
are
making
too
much
money
after
having
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverage
they
run
around
patting
them
selves
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooperation
in
providing
extras
for
those
people
who
deserve
it
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing
routine
low
cost
parts
of
that
provinces
public
health
insurance
plan
again
i
doubt
americans
would
like
giving
the
insurance
companies
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insurers
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinces
and
the
federal
government
years
ago
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
public
system
going
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterwards
they
could
clean
up
okay
this
sort
of
contradicts
what
i
said
higher
up
but
its
another
possibility
theyd
have
an
added
bonus
when
arguing
against
government
involvement
in
their
industryas
they
could
then
point
to
its
failure
instead
of
just
citing
theoretical
principles
i
agree
they
were
in
a
winwin
situation
but
right
now
it
seems
that
they
have
won
bigger

you

one

faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
this
is
a
difficult
problem
for
which
there
is
no
obviously
good
solution
one
approach
is
simply
to
try
and
move
political
opinion
and
hope
a
new
more
libertarian
consensus
lasts
for
a
while
another
approach
is
to
try
and
amend
the
constitution
the
original
constitution
restrained
the
us
government
from
economic
intervention
for
to
years
depending
on
just
how
one
wants
to
count
it
the
first
amendment
though
weakened
in
many
ways
still
restrains
government
particularly
state
and
local
even
though
on
many
particular
issues
the
majority
is
in
favor
of
censorship
i
think
libertarians
would
be
happy
with
another
years
of
restraint
via
an
amendment
or
two
not
that
i
think
thats
likely
to
happen
not
necessarily
mr
hendricks
but
other
posters
seem
to
see
this
as
a
problem
with
libertarianism
that
it
cannot
be
stable
that
might
be
true
but
it
is
not
an
objection
to
libertarianism
per
se
if
a
libertarian
political
consensus
forms
for
a
decade
or
two
and
then
falls
apart
again
we
would
just
be
back
where
we
are
now
this
is
unlike
the
case
for
socialism
where
a
socialist
consensus
that
held
for
a
while
and
then
fell
apart
would
not
leave
us
where
we
are
now
but
instead
with
lots
of
bureaucracy
that
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
if
not
tyranny

the

account

at

health

as
far
as

is
concerned
the

estimates
that
its
total

is
about
billion
per
year
thats
about
of
the
total
current
increase
in

and
the
estimate
is
from
a
group
that
could
be
expected
to
overestimate
the
impacts
of
defensive

on

as
small
a

as
this
is
in

however
clinton

favoring

whats
wrong

at

the

since

the

has
to
step
in

help
shutting
down
selective

would
cost
good
jobs
and
we
cant
do
that
what
we
really
need
is
to
involve
selective

we

national

every

without
some
evidence
to
this

i
used
it
purely
as

descriptive
adjective
in

manner
than
many
most
news
people
have
used
it
in
the
past
the
entire
second
trial
was
about
race
ted
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
discuss
mr
kings
racial
background
but
had
mr
king
been
white
there
would
not
have
been
a
second

you
probably
are
saying
that
the
beating
would
not
have
occurred
if
he
were
white
but
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
call
to
make
it
is
possible
the
case
but
not
definately
i
still
think
your
actions
are

ted
they
are
far
more
divisive
than
me
using
the
adjective
black
in
a
nonderogenory
manner
would
you
have
been
happier
if
i
had
used
africanamerican
if
so

you

are

that

in

the

just
such
a

approach
to
the

of

libertarians
would
do

to

let

try

one

as
such

is
highly
diluted
i
might
add
that
even
if
one
were
free
to

on

the
vast
amount
of
time
required
for

combined
with
the

would

with
respect

specific

sorry
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
the
only
feasible
approach
what
is
not
feasible
is
a
wholesale
attack
on
all
government
regulation
and
licensing
that
treats
cutting

im
not

what

in
this

do
you
mean
that

or
merely
that
it

undesirable
in
fact
actually
the
only
areas
of
public

above
that
strike
me
as
generating
substantial
support
among
libertarians
are
police
and
defense
of
the
four
you
saw
fit
to
mention
and
education
of
minors
is
always
another
possibility
since
minors
are
generally
considered
not
to
be
responsible
to
make
their
own
decisions
as
adults
are
it
is
an
interesting
aside
that
as
committed
as
libertarians
claim
to
be
to
a
principle
of
noncoercion
the
only
areas
of

that
they
frequently
support
involve
hiring
people
with
gunshmmm
you
say
this
as
if
it
were
surprising
yet
in
fact
a
necessary
consequence
of
libertarian

all
noncoersive
functions
should
be
dealt
with
privately
therefore
it
follows
that
the
only
functions
remaining
to
the
state
are
the
coersive
ones
perhaps
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consider
that
revolutionaries
frequently
generate
support
by
acting
as
protectors
of
geezers
mothers
and

governments
that
ignore
such
people
on
the
grounds
that
we
dont
have
much
to

from
them
do
so
at

more

its

the

in
the

let
me

the

an

do
you

you
still

questions

do
you
participate

you

id
really
like

a

of
this
trial
id
especially
like
to
know
what
happened
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
that
question
assuming
that
the
reports
that
he
did
so
are
accurate
im
not
accusing
tom

of
making
anything
up
but
this
is
the
sort
of
case
that
spawns
garbled
misquotes
false
rumors
and
urban
legends
like
tribbles
itd
be
nice
to
think
that
the
prosecutor
objected
irrelevant
prejudicial
inflammatory
take
your
pick
and
that
the
judge
upheld
the
objection
i
did
hear
this
question
asked
during
a
radio
news
update
of
the
case
they
were
talking
about
the
ongoing
trial
and
had
some
audio
clips
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
the
question
there
was
an
objection
heard
in
the
background
the
clip
ended
at
that
point
so
i
dont
know
if
the
objection
was
upheld
i
cant
imagine
nc
is
that
bad
the
arresting
officer
said
the
bastards
told
him
they
did
it
on
purpose
and
hoped
the
victim
would
die
and
you
think
the
defense
made
a
good
case
no
wonder
were
losing
were
aparently
not
trying

win
again
id
like
to
see
the
transcript
id
read
the
latter
bit
of
that
in
the
news
media
the
arresting
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
calmly
asked
him
about
the
condition
of
the
homo
and
said
that
he
hoped
hed
die
but
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
of
the
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
actually
said
that
he
did
anything
at
all
let
alone
that
he
did
it

this
i
didnt

as
an

heard
it
reported
a

both

because
if

could
you
please
supply
with
a
post
preferably
some
proof
of
this
ie
newspaper
articles
documenting
such
allegations
etc
well
your
ignorance
about
this
is
unsurprising
given
youre
a
canadian
and
im
at
a
complete
loss
at
to
why
you
should
be
so
interested
in
this
given
that
it
is
an
american
issue
which
should
properly
be
of
absolutely
no
concern
to
you
at
all
actually
my
interest
in
gender
issues
is
not
limited
to
international
boundaries
indeed
i
often
exchange
information
with
americans
about
issues
which
concern
us
in
both
countries
in
any
event
in
answer
to
your
question
the
following
is
taken
from
david

article
the
real
anita

published
in
the
march
issue
of

this
is
taken
from
page
ahsomeone
had
mentioned
this
journal
but
gave
no
further
information
but
the
most
bizarre
incident
is
alleged
to
have
happened
in
the
school
year
at
oral
roberts
university
according
to
a
sworn
affidavit
dated
october
and
filed
with
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
lawrence
shiles
now
a
lawyer
in
tulsa
recounted
the
following
shortly
after
the
class
had
begun
professor
hill
gave
us
a
written
assignment
which
i
completed
and
duly
turned
in
when
this
assignment
was
passed
out
to
the
class
after
having
been
marked
by
the
professor
sitting
next
to
me
were
fellow
students
jeffrey
londoff
and
mark
stewart
upon
opening
the
assignments
and
reviewing
our
grades
and
comments
made
by
anita
hill
i
found
ten
to
twelve
short
black
pubic
hairs
in
the
pages
of
my
assignment
i
glanced
over
at
jeff
londoffs
assignment
and
saw
similar
pubic
hairs
in
his
work
at
the
time
i
made
the
statement
to
londoff
that
either
she
had
a
low
opinion
of
our
work
or
she
had
graded
our
assignment
in
the
bathroom
mark
stewart
overheard
the
conversation
and
said
that
he
had
similar
pubic
hairs
in
his
assignment
also
this
became
the
standing
joke
among
many
students
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
in
classes
other
students
in
that
class
confirmed
the
story
londoff
says
he
couldnt
be
certain
that
the
hairs
were
pubic
but
he
said
he
thought
it
was
unlikely
that
they
could
have
come
from
hills
head
since
they
were
short
coarse
and
curly
and
hill
had
had
the
hair
on
her
head
straightened
another
student
who
saw
the
hair
but
did
not
want
to
be
identified
said
of
its
origins
you
just
know
when
you
see
it
does
this
satisfy
you
yes
thank
you
though
i
am
really
curious
as
to
why
this
never
came
out
at
least
not
in
what
i
saw
up
here
in
canada
or
on
cnn
which
is
sent
up
here
during
the
thomas
nomination
hearings
surely
one
would
think
that
her
claim
to
having
been
sexually
harassed
would
have
a
great
deal
less
credibility
if
it
could
be
shown
that
she
had
herself
been
guilty
of
it
or
do
you
regard
sworn
statements
given
to
a
us
senate
committee
as
equivalent
to
toilet
paper
ahemmm
it
depends
for
instance
if
it
were
the
sworn
statements
at
the
warren
commission
then
yes
i
would
say
that
the
statements
were
no
better
than
toilet
paper
used
at
that
but
in
most
cases
the

would

furthermore
i
am
suggesting
that
such

not

in

industrial

because
the

misery

the

no

its

that
on

hand
libertarians
assume
a
limited
government
can
be
decreed
yet
on
the
other
posit
an
entire
government
made
up
of
people
who
carry
guns
i
realize
that
many
libertarians
assume
that
such
a
government
will
be
counterbalanced
by
a
fully
armed
citizenry
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
widespread
civilian
ownership
of
guns
does
not
necessarily
prevent
the
establishment
of

i

to
seem

you
still
seem

be

i

it

even

if

what
can
we
say
about
these

who
dont
identify
as

have

obviously
a
large

more
accurately
were
forced
to
choose

put

cramer

the

who
are

hung
up

obviously

i

i
have
never

anyone

the

used

did

i
used
it

in

manner
than
many
most

people
have
used
it
in
the

no
one
is
questioning

mr

the
question
arises
whether
kings
race
should
make
police
officers
afraid

your

seems
to
imply
that

should
have
a

it

tyranny

there
are
too
often
conflicting
ideas

what
constitutes
improving
the

far
better
to
let
people

pursue

they

let

there

in

let
me
try
to
put
it
another
way
libertarians
believe
that
an
unconstrained
environment
provides
the
best
chance
of
solving
any
problem
because
it
maximizes
creativity
however
there
is
never
any
guarantee
that
a
really
good
solution
will
ever
be
found
to
any
particular
problem
utopia
is
not
an
option
utopia
is
a
myth
although
we
can
do
a
lot
better
than
what
we
have
today
but
i
think
that
you
must
pitch
libertarianism
as
a
progressive
agenda
ie
you
can
do
better

our
style

i
admire

you

when
it

you
need

whether
you
want

not
what
we
need
are
more

who
agree

know
something

i
found
out
about
some
of
the
politics
that
is
going
on
with
the
texas
bullet
train
and
was
appalled
at
some
of
the
apparent
underhanded
tactics
to
push
this
thing
through
without
any
public
say
whatsoever
so
i
wrote
up
a
short
editorial
thing
and
posted
it
hoping
to
get
some
discussion
i
suppose
editorials
dont
do
it
here
so
now
i
am
asking
for
the
general
opinion
of
the
net
about
the
proposed
high
speed
train
what
do
you
think
i
personally
think
it
is
a
stupid
idea
and
that
there
are
a
few
people
somewhere
who
are
going
to
get
very
rich
from
this
deal
my
opinion
is
this
in
a
society
whose
economy
is
primarily
based
on
capitalism
the
role
of
government
should
be
to
provide
those
goods
and
services
that
need
providing
for
the
general
publics
good
but
government
should
supply
those
necessary
goods
and
services
only
when
it
is
impossible
for
a
private
enterprise
or
individual
to
make
money
from
providing
them
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
posts
that
this
train
probably
can
not
make
money
and
will
rely
heavily
on
state
tax
dollars
the
question
i
think
then
becomes
do
we
the
general
public
need
the
train
i
certainly
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
need
this
train
in
lubbock
texas
with
the
inexpensive
air
travel
provided
between
dallas
and
houston
i
dont
think
people
in
dallas
or

need

once
it
is
eliminated
on
the
part
of
the
state
it
is
no
longer
worth
serious
consideration
is
a
view
that
is
peculiar
to
libertarians
and
anarchists
for
example
does
noninitiated
force
coercion
include
tax
collection
does
it
include
the
minimal
level
of
regulation
of
commerce
envisioned
by
adam
smith
since
coercion
can
be
exercised
by
actors
other
than
the
state
how
is
the
state
to
deal
with
it
exclusively
through
after
the
fact
arbitrationlegal
compulsion
the
means
to
reaching
such
a
restricted
government
is
another
topic
which
ill
address
briefly
it
certainly
wont
happen
until
libertarianism
is
the
dominate
philosophy
what
means
do
we
have
to
make
libertarianism
the
dominate
philosophy
statists
run
the
education
monopoly
so
we
have
to
be
creative
the
advocates
for
selfgovernment
reports
of
their
seminar
participants
embrace
libertarianism
thats
the
best
means
ive
seen
yet
we
should
lobby
for
compulsory
seminar
attendance
in
jest
well
i
must
admit
that
the
picture
of
libertarians
as
amway
participants
is
somewhat
more
reassuring
than
the
idea
of
them
trying
to
govern
a
complex
conflictual
industrial
society
id
venture
to
point
out
however
that
if
libertarians
couldnt
convince
at
least
of
a
group
of
seminar
participants
to
embrace
their
philosophy
their
propaganda
skills
need
to
be
honed
frankly
however
it
is
no
great
trick
to
create
a
government
for
a
society
in
which
almost
everyone
is
assumed
to
agree
about
what
is
a
proper
government
policy
once
that
is
assumed
all
sorts
of
annoying
formalities
can
be
dispensed
with
elections
police
etc
and
as
mr
marx
said
the
state
will
just
wither
away
on
the
way
there
however
would
you
like
to
explain
how
eliminating
virtually
all
policies
that
restrain
private
coercion
in
the
current
society
will
help
us
to
live
happier
lives
or
is
it
like
socialism
just
some
shortterm
pain
that
well
have
to
bear
until
everyone
has
had
the
benefit
of
reeducation
through
regular
seminar
training

punishing
the
person
for

such
a
thing
smacks
of
authoritarianism
its
a
deliberate
act
of
fraud
intended
to
cause
harm
you
seem
to
be
unclear
about
the
legal
meaning
of
fraud
mere
misrepresentation
is
not
fraud
your
comment
here
is
meant
as
a
put
down
it
fails
for
several
reasons
you
have
edited
out
the
context
of
the
action
under
discussion
i
never
brought
the
legal
definition
up
i
use
the
english
language
and
not
the
legal
dialect
the
legal
definition
of
fraud
changes
from
one
country
to
another
in
any
case
the
context
of
the
discussion
is
morality
of
censorship
how
does
a
posting
from
your
site
do
any
such
thing
especially
if
your
site
is
a
university
do
you
know
any
person
who
believes
that
a
university
endorses
every
comment
made
from
a
university
site
that
is
why
i
refered
specifically
to
a
company
good
now
do
you
know
any
person
who
believes
that
a
company
endorses
every
comment
made
from
a
university
site
you
are
extrapolating
from
the
statement
i
made
concerning
a
circumstance
in
which
such
an
act
of
censorship
would
be
permissable
to
the
teel
case
if
you
had
bothered
to
read
the
post
instead
of
trying
to
prove
how
stupid
you
thought
me
you
would
have
done
rather
better
the
mode
of
argument
i
was
using
was
a
form
of
rhetoric
argument
by
example
i
describe
a
wide
set
of
circumstances
in
which
an
action
is
permisable
and
demonstrate
that
they
do
not
apply
thus
the
action
is
not
permisable
obviously
a
company
posting
from
a
university
adress
would
be
squashed
it
would
be
contrary

the
internet
comercial

if

taken
as

you
get
a
better
stationery

now
you
are
clutching
at
straws
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
it
was
the
fact
of
association
between
the
company
and
the
post
that
was
important
the
typeface
etc
is
inconsequential
there
are
people
on
the
net
who
are
openly
supporting
the
murder
of
members
of

sigh
if
you
are
implying
that

i

you
read
mark

if
you
are
suggesting
that
advocating
murder
is
a
trivial
matter
i
would
prefer
that
you
state
it
directly
certainly
i
oppose
the
right
of
dr
sidiqui
and
the
ayatolah
khomenhi
to
call
for
the
murder
of
salman
rushdie
incitement
to
murder
is
not
part
of
what
i
consider
legitimate
freedom
of
speech
as
for
your
notion
that
employees
can
argue
their
different
political
views
at
their
own
expense
could
you
explain
precisely
what
expense
youre
talking
about
internet
is
not
free
the
connection
charges
are
quite
expensive
for
comercial
concerns
could
you
give
me
a
cost
breakdown
for
the
expense
to
your
company
attributable
to
an
employees
posting
a
political
view
in
disagreement
with
yours
numbers
please
that
is
irrelevant
the
case
is
not
the
incremental
cost
but
the
facility
cost
if
i
decide
that
a
company
i
am
associated
with
should
subscribe
to
usenet
that
usenet
connection
is
the
property
of
the
company
it
is
quite
legitimate
for
a
company
to
have
a
political
or
other
agenda
and
regulate
the
use
of
its
property
in
accordance
with
its
policy
for
example
if
a
microsoft
employee
were
to
post
windows
nt
is
crap
dont
buy
it
from
a
microsoft
machine
i
would
consider
it
reasonable
for
microsoft
to
sack
that
employee
in
the
same
way
if
a
company
decides
that
it
has
political
objectives
it
might
wish
to
regulate
postings
in
a
political
manner
this
is
no
worse
than
rupert
murdoch
using
his
papers
as
a
political
platform
for
his
views
i
was
refering
to
the
arrogance
of
your
position
quoting
the
words
written
by
slave
owners
at
me
in
the
cause
of
freedom
which
words
written
by
slave
owners
did
i
quote
i
dont
recall
quoting
anyone
ah
yes
you
did
not
quote
them
merely
refered
to
them
your
constitution
is
not
considered
sacrosanct
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
nor
have
i
assumed
it
is
i
dont
consider
the
first
amendment
to
have
talismanic
value
you
might
just
as
well
have
attempted
to
argue
from
the
king
james
bible
to
a
muslim
i
was
pointing
out
that
your
reasoning
is
parochial
when
with
little
effort
you
could
have
made
a
substantive
point
i
made
the
effort
apparently
you
made
a
certain
effort
to
misunderstand
me
your
article
consisted
of
a
reference
to
the
first
ammendment
your
signature
and
pretty
well
damn
all
else
for
an
example
of
a
uk
publication
that
understands
this
try
index
on
censorship
i
used
to
subscribe
i
would
still
if
i
was
not
moving
index
regularly
publishes
opinions
by
nonamericans
who
believe
the
first
amendment
represents
appropriate
freespeech
principles
for
all
open
societies
see
eg
the
opinions
of
the
dissenting
law
lords
in
the
spycatcher
case
are
you
refering
to
the
initial
hearings
on
an
injunction
or
the
judgments
on
the
substantive
case
the
initial
hearings
that
the
government
won
were
judged
on
the
not
unresonable
judgment
that
assertion
by
the
government
that
the
national
interest
might
be
harmed
would
be
grounds
for
prior
restraint
the
second
set
of
hearings
on
the
substance
judged
that
the
government
had
no
case
and
that
the
official
secrets
act
could
not
be
used
to
suppress
information
in
thwe
public
domain
already
the
part
that
they
won
was
over
the
copyright
issue
which
is
rather
separate
here
again
the
issue
of
censorship
is
rather
different
in
the
case
that
information
is
divulged
on
the
understanding
that
it
will
not
be
communicated
to
third
parties
the
first
ammendment
certainly
does
not
apply
in
this
case
as
the
numerous
prosecutions
of
spies
in
the
us
proves
the
crux
of
the
spycatcher
affair
was
extrateritoriality
of
british
law
the
censorship
aspect
of
it
arose
as
a
result
of
the
governments
ludicrous
attempts
to
prevent
summary
of
the
case
in
the
book
you
havent
any
reason
to
believe
that
anything
ive
said
has
been
reached
unquestioningly
only
most
of
what
you
write
for
someone
who
purports
to
be
opposed
to
argument
from
assertion
you
certainly
get
by
on
assertions
a
lot
funny
i
saw
that
as
a
rejection
of
an
assertion
that
you
had
made
of
course
in
rejecting
an
assertion
i
have
to
make
a
contrary
assertion
since
this
assertion
is
unprovable
i
left
it
at
that
so
far
i
have
not
seen
you
demonstrate
a
command
of
the
contrary
opinion
to
your
own
you
are
attacking
my
anticensorship
view
because
i
dare
to
accept
the
validity
of
some
procensorship
arguments
while
rejecting
their
conclusions
plus
i
am
not
an
absolutist
i
have
this
funny
idea
that
the
solution
to
this
problem
was
not
decided
in
by
a
group
of
white
male
gentry
in
secret
session
and
sumarized
in
a
single
line
furthermore
i
dont
think
that
the
issues
are
half
as
simple
as
you
imply
you
may
think
that
i
am
being
antiamerican
in
disallowing
recourse
to
the
first
ammendment
its
just
that
this
argument
has
no
currency
in
the
parts
of
the
world
where
there
is
state
censorship
such
as
iran
kewait
and
israel
i
dont
pretend
to
have
geared
my
discourse
for
all
conceivable
audiences
i
dont
think
that
you
have
geered
your
discourse

that
of
proving
that

socialism

it

all

collapse
from
the

world
to
the
first
indeed
it
is
becoming
more
apparent
every
day
that
socialism
may
not
even
survive
the
turn
of
the
century
ed
of
course
has
never
demonstrated
remarkable
knowlege
of
socialism
or
any
other
political
system
come
to
that
while
the
swedes
have
already
discarded
their
third
way
and
the
french
have
made
history
by
turning
out
the
socialist
party
in
a
recordsetting
defeat
it
is
italy
that
appears
most
precariously
on
the
edge
of
its
political
existence
that
leaves
germany
japan
and
the
uk
as
examples
of
a
country
where
the
right
wing
government
is
on
the
verge
of
collapse
oh
and
of
course
the
usa
which
just
elected
a
socialist
government
italy
today
is
a
basketcase
even
by
european
standards
it
has
introduced
new
taxes
in
months
and
publicsector
revenue
is
at
or
near
the
of
gdp
mark
etc
unfortunately
you
cant
pin
this
on
the
left
or
the
right
both
are
to
blame
both
sides
are
equally
deep
into
the
corruption
scandal
the
only
untained
party
is
the
northern
league
which
is
a
bunch
of
nationalist
separatists
and
the
communist
party
which
has
collapsed
in
spite
of
this
political
gluteny
it
has
an
annual
deficit
exceeding
the
sum
of
all
other
ec
countries
and
a
public
debt
times
that
of
latin
america
italy
is
understandably
having
serious
trouble
selling
its
treasury
bonds
in
the
markets
and
while
italy
is
an
extreme
case
it
is
anything
but
unique
all
european
governments
appear
headed
in
the
same
direction
in
spite
of
their
nominally
nonsocialist
governments
unfortunately
europeans
being
well
europeans
it
is
very
unlikely
that
they
will
discover
americanstyle
liberty
instead
they
will
likely
lurch
from
socialism
to
fascism
as
quickly
as
they
had
moved
from
fascism
to
socialism
never
pausing
along
the
way
to
reasseses

role
of

itself
i
hope
i
am
wrong

should
take
a
look
at
the

deficit
regan

bush
created
together
before
he
starts
to
make

about

collapsing
based
on

deficits
here
none
of

are
serious
on

here

we
have
zero

thank

we
do
not
want
our
countries
to
be
run
by
a
narrow
elite
of

for
the
benefit
of
the
super
wealthy
we
are
quite
happy
with

and
despite
the
fuss
made
in
time
and
newsweek
there
is
remarkably
little
being
done
to
reverse
the
social
welfare
reforms
brought
in
by
socialism
the
problem
with
socialism
is
that
it
started
with
the
aims
of
free
education
and
health
care
and
provision
of
the
welfare
state
this
has
been
achieved
across
the
whole
of
europe
only
the
usa
is
struggling
to
catch
up
the
problem
for
socialism
is
what
to
do
now
it
has
succeeded
nobody
ever
claimed
that
the
collapse
of
socialism
would
be
pretty
the
decline
of
the
nationstate
will
probably
lead
first
to
anarchy
since
politicians
always
cut
essential
services
before

los

it

nobody

thus
does
the
world
hurtle
toward
chaos
even
as
the

approaches
rather
the
opposite
what
is
happening
in
italy
is
that
the

has
collapsed
this
has
meant
that
the
grand
coalition
between
right
and
left

parties
to
keep
out
the

has
also
collapsed
the

have
seized
this
opportunity
to
crack
down
hard
on
fraud
and
corruption
and
have
arrested
half

the
fact

baddly
what

most

terrorism
and

in
recent
editorials
iran
was
universally
recognized
as
te
source
of
the
double
threat
of
statesponsored
terrorism
and
islamic
extremism
but
beyond
this
fear
and
condemnation
journalists
found
little
common
ground
that
would
compel
both
north
and
south
and
arab
and
nonarab
nations
to
work
together
to
combat
the
global
threat
of
terrorism
for
example
egyptian
and
algerian
papers
were
in
the
forefront
in
charging
us
complicity
in
the
current
instability
in
the
middle
east
those
commentators
asserted
that
the
united
states
had
promoted
islamic
fundamentalism
during
the
afghanistan
war
and
had
further
added
to
regional
instability
by
alternately
encouraging
iraq
and
iran
the
cads
the
fact
that
this
is
precisely
what
the
us
was
up
to
of
course
is
not
mentioned
it
is
a
fact
that
regan
and
bush
sold
arms
to
iran
it
is
also
a
fact
that
they
supported
and
armed
iraq
still
this
is
state
dept
propaganda
so
none
too
surprizing
indias
papers
weighed
the
pros
and
cons
of
helping
the
west
to
identify
pakistans
role
in
promoting
terrorism
noting
on
the
one
hand
that
doing
so
could
bring
ruination
to
islamabads
kashmir
cause
but
on
the
other
could
also
bring
indias
security
apparatus
uncomfortably
close
to
the
cia
and
the
mossad
arab
papers
continued
to
portray
iraq
and
libya
as
being
unfairly
treated
by
the
un
while
israel
remains
unpunished
for
resolutions
which
it
has
violated
in
the
case
of
lybia
there
is
the
problem
that
the
us
only
decided
that
gadffii
ordered
the
bombing
after
it
needed
to
make
peace
with
damascus
during
the
gulf
war
one
day
the
us
is
certain
that
its
syria
the
next
lybia
for
a
strange
reason
the
us
will
not
provide
evidence
to
lybian
courts
for
extradition
proceedings
faced
with
similar
demands
the
usa
would
reject
them
as
would
any
other
country
concerning
northern
ireland
president
clintons
message
of
consolation
to
the
victims
of
the
warrington
bombing
was
seen
in
british
tabloids
as
signalling
a
tougher
stance
by
the
american
government
against
violence
by
the
ira
the
word
is
terrorism
the
problem
is
that
after
the
behaviour
of
george
bush
the
usa
has
an
image
abroad
as
doing
precisely
what
it
likes
and
is
in
its
own
interests
then
comming
out
with
a
dysney
scripted
sugary
justification
repeating
a
fitting
combination
of
the
words
freedom
dignity
democaracy
or
of
terrorism
dictatorship
etc
as
appropriate
the
usa
could
go
quite
far
to
mend
the
bridges
with
iran
the
people
there
are
rather
pissed
off
because
the
usa
first
supported
the
shah
who
they
loathed
and
then
supported
saddam
when
he
mounted
an
unprovoked
attack
hardly
surprizing
after
the
embassy
hostage
crisis
but
iran
is
meant
to
be
the
country
run
by
unreasonable
bigots
not
the
usa
so
if
there
is
to
be
movement
it
would
be
easier
for
the
usa
to
move
first
off
they
could
recognise
iraqus
responsibility
in
initiating
the
iraniraq
war
providing
technical
assistance
to
iran
to
get
its
oil
production
back
up
to
capacity
would
also
be
a
smart
move
at
the
moment
iran
is
above
its
opec
ceiling
if
they
had
extra
capacity
they
would
use
it
and
bring
down
the
oild
price
further
which
is
in
our
interests
the
iranian
clerics
would
have
an
interest
in
seeking
a
raprochment
simply
because
a
permanent
war
footing
is
debilitating
they
also

even
when
new

that

that
led

appear
welcome

has
the

decided
that

shouldnt
that
be
up

i

was
that
you
get

comes

tough
if

shows
proclaiming

shouldnt
that
be

to
through

and
call

mennonites

while
hutterites

come
to
that
under

there
wasnt
meant

anything

to

except
keep
the

thats
also
untrue
but
at
least
were
wandering
a

closer
toward
reality
that
the
articles
of

fell
apart
is
enough
proof
it
was
there
for
just
a
tad
bit
more
well
yes
and
no
the
federalist
papers
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
determine
precisely
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
they
certainly
emphasised
a
limited
role
for
the
federal
government
but
this
was
not
necessarily
their
true
position
and
like
the
house
of
lords
which
it
is
copied
from
it
was
given
pretty
wide
powers
unfortunately
they
started
to
use
them
and
thus
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
aware
the
house
of
lords
had
wide
powers
i
was
under
the
impression
is
was
pretty
powerless
compared
to
the
house
of
commons
and
certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce
bills
relating
to
raising
revenue
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
in
the
period
in
question
the
stripping
of
the
powers
of
the
house
of
lords
did
not
occur
until
and
david
llloyd
georges
budget
even
despite
this
the
house
of
lords
has
considerable
power
even
today
and
is
far
from
a
rubber
stamping
body
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
other
writings
gives
me
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
make
use
of
their
lawmaking
powers
in
fact
gridlock
appears
to
have
been
designed
into
the
system
with
the
senate
being
a
more
deliberative
body
to
act
as
a
check
on
the
moreoften
elected
house
the
system
is
meant
to
be
slow
to
react
the
problem
is
that
it
ended
up
a
bit
too
slow
on
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that
the
senate
was
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the
house
youll
note
that
while
the
presidents
veto
may
be
overridden
the
house
cant
do
anything
about
a
veto
by
the
senate
the
president
veto
was
meant
to
be
entirely
separate
until
bush
abused
it
in
a
quite
extraordinary
manner
it
was
used
more
in
accord
with
the
intent
of
being
a
check
on
unreasonable
legislation
the
veto
was
clearly
regarded
as
a
completely
last
gasp
measure
its
use
was
meant
to
be
restricted
to
preventing
the
legislature
interfering
with
the
actions
of
the
executive
the
senate
is
not
meant
to
be
exactly
a
rubber
stamp
body
it
is
meant
as
a
check
on
unrestrained
legislation
that
is
the
extra
measure
built
into
the

in

of
the

of
the

phill

no

what
he

maddison

hamilton
were
both
studying
existing
forms
of

for
several
years
before
they

the

that
the

degree
on
the
uk
model
is
pretty
widely
accepted
at
the
time
there
was
no
other
major
country
with
a
representative
body
the
french
plebicite
had
been
suppressed
for
years
and
its
restoration
eight
years
later
would
mark
the
start
of
the
french
revolution
after
the
uk
system
the
major
influences
were
the
dutch
system
and
of
course
the
classical
systems
nobody
seriously
suggests
that
rome
or
greece
were
models
though
because
the
political
systems
of
both
countries
were
acknowleged
disasters
the
main
lesson
learnt
from
greece
was
that
unless
a
federal
state
was
constructed
a
war
would
be
inevitable
the
greek
democracies
were
always
fighting
amongst
themselves
which
is
how
rome
managed
to
invade
had
the
federal
consitution
been
rejected
the
new
roman
empire
in
the
shape
of
britain
would
quite
certainly
have
reabsorbed
much
of
the
colonies
in
due
course
moreover
the
states
would
have
been
at

throats

you
to
support
this
constitution
so
well
say
anything
that
we
think
will
appeal
to
you
or
the
more
straightforward
this
is
why
we
think
what
weve
suggested
in
this
constitution
is
a
good
idea
you
clearly
consider
the
former
to
be
the
primary
situation
they
certainly
emphasised
a
limited
role
for
the
federal
government
but
this
was
not
necessarily
their
true
position
well
i
know
hamilton
was
a
dyed
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probably
the
authoritarian
extreme
to
jeffersons
democratic
impules
but
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
means
of
determining
their
opinions
on
the
government
if
we
dont
consider
what
they
wrote
about
the
government
and
is
writing
in
support
of
something
automatically
propoganda
to
the
point
we
must
assume
it
is
untrue
or
that
they
are
saying
what
they
dont
believe
and
like
the
house
of
lords
which
it
is
copied
from
it
was
given
pretty
wide
powers
unfortunately
they
started
to
use
them
and
thus
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
aware
the
house
of
lords
had
wide
powers
i
was
under
the
impression
is
was
pretty
powerless
compared
to
the
house
of
commons
and
certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce
bills
relating
to
raising
revenue
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
in
the
period
in
question
if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
other
writings
gives
me
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
make
use
of
their
lawmaking
powers
in
fact
gridlock
appears
to
have
been
designed
into
the
system
with
the
senate
being
a
more
deliberative
body
to
act
as
a
check
on
the
moreoften
elected
house
the
system
is
meant
to
be
slow
to
react
the
problem
is
that
it
ended
up
a
bit
too
slow
i
disagree
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
was
simply
designed
to
handle
less
than
it
has
demanded
that
it
handle
as
somebody
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
has
become
everybodys
city
council
congress
is
more
than
capable
of
quick
action
and
has
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
its
hands
if
it
confined
itself
to
what
its
original
jurisidiction
was
and
allowed
more
local
autonomy
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
government
they
created
failing
but
that
it
is
operating
under
a
set
of
conditions
they
specifically
wanted
to
avoid
namely
a
concentration
of
power
it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduce
the
power
of
either
house
in
some
attempt
to
grease
the
wheels
all
youll
get
then
is
a
system
which
moves
quicker
to
do
stupid
things
it
would
make
more
sense
to
make
more
decisions
at
a
local
level
on
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that
the
senate
was
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the
house
youll
note
that
while
the
presidents
veto
may
be
overridden
the
house
cant
do
anything
about
a
veto
by
the
senate
the
president
veto
was
meant
to
be
entirely
separate
until
bush
abused
it
in
a
quite
extraordinary
manner
it
was
used
more
in
accord
with
the
intent
of
being
a
check
on
unreasonable
legislation
please
explain
to
me
how
bush
abused
the
veto
in
an
extraordinary
manner
the
veto
was
clearly
regarded
as
a
completely
last
gasp
measure
its
use
was
meant
to
be
restricted
to
preventing
the
legislature
interfering
with
the
actions
of
the
executive
i
fail
to
see
where
any
restrictions
implied
or
otherwise
were
placed
on
the
veto
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
read
as
a
means
to
put
a
check
on
democratically
popular
but
unwise
in
the
executives
opinion
policies
there
is
no
limit
in
the
constitution
to
the
presidents
veto
power
regarding
what
a
bill
is
for
previous
presidents
have
used
the
veto
for
any
number
of
reasons
most
usually
having
something
to
do
with
their
agenda
i
am
really
curious
how
you
single
bush
out
as
the
president
who
abused
vetos
the
senate
is
not
meant
to
be
exactly
a
rubber
stamp
body
it
is
meant
as
a
check
on
unrestrained
legislation
that
is
the
extra
measure
built
into
the
constitution
in
favour
of
the
status
quo
of
the
representatives
of
the
states
is
not
a
reasonable
restriction
why
is
it
not
a
reasonable
restriction
because
senators
is
the
magic
holy
number
upon
which
laws
must
be
based
if
senators
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constituencies
to
stand
up
and
fillibuster
isnt
that
enough
to
indicate
theres
a
sufficient
question
as
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevaluate
it
why
one
earth
should
be
sufficient
to
enact
a
law
which
covers
million
people
in
very
very
diverse
places
and
living
in
radically
different
conditions
why
shouldnt
a
supermajority
be
required
any
system
in
which
the
simple
majority
is
given
absolute
power
to
ignore
the
minority
then
the
minority
will
be
ignored
i
do
not
see
this
as
a
positive
thing
and
for
all
that
im
sure
the
republicans
are
looking
for
pork
as
much
as
the
democrats
theyve
got
some
legitimate
objections

the
madison

the
main
difference
between
adolf

and
rush
limbaugh
is
that
hitler
was
original
and
showed
initiative
mort
sahl
on
the
tom
snyder
radio
show
abc
radio
network
october
although
i
find
myself
often
disagreeing
with
the
populist
rationale
of
mr
limbaugh
i
find
him
entertaining
and
i
often
agree
with
his
conclusions
the
fact
that
he
sends
liberal
reactionaries
like
these
idiots
through
the
roof
makes
him
all
the
more
entertaining
nlnsbelieve
it
or
not
i
was
planning
this
comparative
review
of
mein
kampf
and
limbaughs
transcribed
rant
the
way
things
ought
to
be
before
sahl
issued
his
comparative
review
as
usual
sahls
was
independent
and
sharp
as
a
scalpel
my
effort
can
only
dream
of
comparing
favorably
to
morts
at
least
it
has
a
fairly
popular
orginating
premise
everyone
id
mention
the
idea
to
thought
it
was
either
divinely
inspired
or
at
least
past
due
for
delivery
those
reactions
are
based
on
parallels
that
should
be
obvious
to
the
most
peripheral
observer
of
the
acts
of
those
false
prophets
both
are
noted
for
their
galvanizing
oratorical
skills
which
they
both
used
with
passion
to
generate
a
political
cult
of
massive
numerical
proportions
in
fact
limbaugh
claims
to
have
an
audience
of
just
over
million
almost
identical
to
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
hitler
in
the
april
german
election
both
used
a
myopic
social
perspective
to
build
the
cult
and
enthusiastically
amputated
facts
from
the
record
to
fabricate
their
ideological
quilt
actually
i
find
limbaughs
oratory
less
than
sizzling
and
his
debating
skills
sometimes
lacking
even
though
his
conclusions
are
often
correct
i
would
suggest
that
a
bankrupt
leftist
ideology
that
hopes
to
use
concentrated
political
power
and
a
loaded
gun
to
force
everyone
to
do
the
right
things
where
right
is
defined
by
the
elitist
academics
who
lead
the
movement
is
showing
an
acute
case
of
myopic
social
perspective
not
to
mention
arrogance
and
utter
stupidity
limbaugh
is
certainly
far
from
perfect
but
his
opponents
in
the
established
body
politic
and
the
media
are
the
ones
arguing
for
federal
control
of
virtually
all
aspects
of
the
lives
of
the
citizenry
and
for
the
elimination
of
local
control
over
affairs
public
perhaps
limbaugh
has
a
following
because
the
people
are
tired
of
being
treated
like
errant
children
by
a
selfimportant
group
of
arrogant
controlling
myopic
people
who
have
no
understanding
of
how
life
operates
outside
of
the
oughtabes
inside
their
own
hopelessly
closed
minds
the
last
point
is
glaringly
documented
by
passages
in
the
opening
pages
of
both
books
hitlers
example
is
when
on
page
he
claims
the
german
nationalist
terrorist
leo
schlageter
he
bombed
part
of
a
railway
line
between
dusseldorf
and
duisburg
being
caught
in
the
act
in
was
betrayed
to
france
by
a
representative
of
his
government
when
there
has
never
been
any
factual
foundation
for
such
a
statement
in
fact
the
governments
of
both
the
reich
and
prussia
as
well
as
the
vatican
actively
intervened
to
save
him
from
execution
and
almost
succeeded
ok
let
us
take
your
word
for
that
and
work
with
it
a
nice
specific
incident
limbaugh
follows
suit
by
making
the
hysterically
sarcastic
claim
in
his
introduction
that
in
a
school
or
during
a
commencement
ceremony
or
many
other
public
places
god
is
unconstitutional
of
course
its
not
god
but
the
official
imposition
of
particular
concepts
of
god
against
an
individuals
will
thats
unconstitutional
but
limbaugh
is
too
gleeful
in
his
talent
for
distortion
to
want
you
to
know
that
hmmm
congress
shall
pass
no
law
regarding
an
establishment
of
religion
nor
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
liberal
translation
the
federal
government
as
long
as
it
is
run
by
liberals
may
force
local
school
districts
to
include
certain
iconic
content
in
christmas
displays
while
prohibiting
others
i
think
limbaugh
has
you
on
this
one
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
arguing
for
less
imposition
of
the
federal
government
into
religion
nice
job
on
the
specificity
of
that
one
too
analysis

deleted
but
as
mort
sahl
also
observed
on

radio
the
other
night
some
cloutmeister
of
the
radical
right
wants
limbaugh
to
be
a
focal
point
of
their
propoganda
and
remember
sahl
is
an
al

these

mort
might
not

exactly
who

of

mclaughlin
the
former

of

now
limbaughs
partner
in

company
but
mort
himself
is
a
veteran
of
the

hosted
them
in

washington
and
los

he
knows
what
evil
lurks
in
the
hearts
of
major
market
media
men
he
knows
that
limbaugh
could
not
have
collected
his
audience
had
not
the
opportunity
been
placed
on
a
silver
platter
and
handed
to
him
limbaugh
earns
his
money
just
as
honestly
as
al
capone
did
its
almost
worthy
of
a
rico
indictment
ah
yes
it
is
a
conspiracy
of
profound
proportions
methinks
that
you
may
be
a
bit
resentful
of
mr
limbaughs
success
because
you
attribute
it
primarily
to
luck
how
after
all
could
anyone
with
profound
differences
of
opinion
from
yourself
have
become
successful
without
the
operation
of
conspiracy
or
blind
luck
do
you
feel
this
same
level
of
kneejerk
resentment
against
lottery
winners
or
do
you
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
on
questions
of
social
issues
there
is
an
overabundance
of
material
in
the
limbaugh
book
that
seems
to
echo
hitlers
venom
for
example
this
should
be
great
fun
since
it
is
the
liberal
movement
in
america
that
is
pushing
the
hardest
for
centralized
fascist
control
of
the
people
and
business
governmentbusiness
partnership
indeed
and
mr
limbaugh
is
the
populist
nemesis
of
that
movement
i
have
read
mr
limbaughs
book
and
although
it
was
not
the
most
literary
piece
i
have
read
in
recent
memory
it
certainly
did
not
contain
venom
at
all
let
alone
venom
comparable
to
an
individual
who
callously
murdered
millions
out
of
racism
on
their
own
qualifications
to
control
society
hitler
out
of
the
host
of
sometimes
millions
of
people
who
individually
more
or
less
clearly
and
distinctly
guess
the
truth
partly
perhaps
understand
it
one
man
authors
emphasis
must
step
forward
in
order
to
form
with
apodeictic
force
out
of
the
wavering
world
of
imagination
of
the
great
masses
granite
principles
and
to
take
up
the
fight
for
their
sole
correctness
until
out
of
the
playing
waves
of
a
free
world
of
thought
a
brazen
rock
of
uniform
combination
of
form
and
will
arises
page
a
very
serious
tone
in
that
oratory
limbaugh
who
needs
the
media
when
theyve
got
me
the
show
is
devoted
exclusively
to
what
i
think
the
phrase
with
half
my
brain
tied
behind
my
back
to
make
it
even
denotes
the
egress
of
mental
aptitude
i
require
to
engage
and
demolish
liberals
and
others
who
disagree
with
me
it
might
take
four
or
five
years
but
im
convinced
the
media
will
slowly
and
reluctantly
come
around
to
my
way
of
thinking
kicking
and
screaming
all
the
way
pages
and
respectively
you
neglect
to
mention
that
mr
limbaugh
have
you
ever
listened
to
his
show
btw
continuously
encourages
his
audience
to
think
for
themselves
rather
than
blindly
following
any
media
icon
himself
included
you
yourself
mention
that
he
makes
no
bones
about
his
show
being
strictly
about
his
own
opinions
he
also
adopts
a
rather
satirical
approach
and
presumes
his
audience
to
be
intelligent
enough
to
distinguish
satire
from
seriousness
and
he
says
as
much
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
average
massmedia
show
in
which
the
audience
is
treated
as
societys
intellectual
lowest
common
denominator
i
am
sure
that
adolf
hitler
was
a
master
of
satire
i
am
sure
he
was
just
kidding
when
he
said
that
the
jews
were
the
cause
of
germanys
problems
and
needed
to
be
exterminated
on
religion
as
the
basis
of
a
nation
hitler
in
this
world
human
culture
and
civilization
are
inseperably
bound
up
with
the
existence
of
the
aryan
his
dyingoff
or
his
decline
would
again
lower
upon
this
earth
the
dark
veils
of
a
time
without
culture
he
who
dares
to
lay
hand
upon
the
highest
image
of
the
lord
sins
against
the
benevolent
creator
of
this
miracle
and
helps
in
the
expulsion
from
paradise
page
this
is
not
religion
it
is
clearly
a
perverse
worship
of
race
since
christ
was
a
jew
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
hitlers
characterization
of
the
aryan
as
the
highest
image
of
the
lord
fits
with
christian
doctrine
limbaugh
america
was
founded
as
a
judeochristian
country
but
our
intellectual
and
political
elites
are
often
either
hostile
or
ambivalent
toward
religion
people
for
whom
belief
in
god
is
at
best
a
charming
superstition
have
managed
to
ban
prayer
from
the
public
schools
for
the
last
thirty
years
is
it
only
a
coincidence
that
the
quality
of
american
education
has
declined
ever
since
pages
private
religious
schools
have
a
vastly
better
record
of
success
than
publicly
funded
schools
american
history
is
indeed
primarily
judeo
christian
i
suppose
that
mr
limbaugh
pointing
out
facts
is
equivalent
to
adolf
hitler
worshiping
the
aryan
race
i
think
you
might
be
reaching
just
a
wee
bit
here
on
popular
culture
as
a
reason
for
social
collapse
hitler
the
fight
against
the
poisoning
of
the
soul
has
to
set
in
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
menus
of
our
movie
houses
vaudevilles

pages
and
definite
suggestion
that
the

should
control
the
entertainment
industry
here
limbaugh
today
hollywood
is
in
trouble
the
reason
is
that
hollywood
has
forgotten
who
its
audience
is
they
make
fun
of
people
who
believe
in
god
they
ridicule
the
traditional
family
heterosexuality
and
monagamy
they
disparage
american
heroes
page
just
a
guess
here
but
i
dont
think
that
mr
limbaugh
would
advocate
government
control
of
hollywood
you
should
perhaps
call
his
radio
show
to
confirm
this
i
believe
this
is
more
a
criticism
of
hollywood
and
the
depraved
moral
values
it
espouses
not
an
advocation
of
government
control
of
hollywood
liberals
on
the
other
hand
want
to
have
complete
government
control
of
our
school
systems
so
that
the
government
can
teach
the
people
at
an
early
age
the
right
way
to
view
religion
and
morality
i
believe
mr
limbaugh
is
against
this
as
his
satirical
use
of
the
young
heads
full
of
mush
hyperbole
indicates
on
the
news
meida
hitler
the
activity
of
the
socalled
liberal
press
was
the
work
of
gravediggers
for
the
german
people
and
the
german
reich
one
can
pass
by
in

the
marxist
papers
of

its
task
is
only
to
break
the
peoples
folkish

national

to
make

the

pretty
strong

theory

to
be
used

break
up
the
conspiracy
limbaugh
elements
of
the
media
have
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
of
leftist
causes
the
cynical
journalist
of
the
past
has
been
replaced
in
many
cases
by
an
enthusiastic
cheerleader
for
causes
during
the
gulf
war
cnn
correspondent
bernard
shaw
said
cnn
is
a
global
network
we
cant
take
sides
cant
take
sides
if
they
dont
realize
that
their
freedom
lies
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
that
therefore
they
should
defend
this
nation
they
are
hopelessly
misguided
and
may
i
suggest
flirting
with
megalomania
pages
and
indication
here
that
elements
of
the
media
since
career
is
a
selfselected
categorization
perhaps
an
inferred
larger
percentage
than
represented
in
the
populace
at
large
has
a
leftist
bias
doesnt
sound
too
unreasonable
no
insinuation
that
cnn
should
not
report
in
an
objective
fashion
only
that
for
reporters
to
say
that
they
do
not
have
any
personal
bias
in
the
situation
is
disingenuous
to
megalomaniacal
you
may
disagree
and
it
may
well
be
exagerrated
but
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
opinion
and
mr
limbaugh
goes
well
out
of
his
way
to
make
sure
that
his
audience
knows
that
these
are
his
opinions
unlike
most
other
reporting
that
purports
to
achieve
perfect
objectivity
but
in
actuality
will
in
some
degree
or
other
in
a
statistical
sense
reflect
the
biases
of
the
reporters
who
is
being
disingenuous
here
mr
shaw
or
mr
limbaugh
again
you
should
ask
mr
limbaugh
himself
but
i
expect
that
he
would
oppose
government
control
of
the
media
to
continue
these
comparative
excerpts
is
certainly
possible
but
ultimately
too
depressing
to
take
in
one
reading
it
is
indeed
depressing
to
see
such
myopia
and
tiresome
liberal
arrogance
liberals
love
to
play
games
with
paradigms
as
a
way
of
discrediting
people
who
disagree
with
them
why
dont
you
challenge
conservative
ideology
on
an
intellectual
level
rather
than
engaging
in
ludicrous
comparisons
perhaps
the
underpinnings
of
your
ideology
are
intellectual
only
in
that
they
exist
in
your
mind
not
the
real
world
after
putting
these
books
down
there
is
one
undeniable
fact
that
haunts
me
in
the
adolf
hitler
fed
depressed
and
frightened
germans
the
opiate
of
hatred
of
those
around
them
in
turn
it
allowed
germans
to
hand
their
collective
national
power
to
the
nazis
in
the
rush
limbaugh
is
doing
the
very
same
thing
distributing
hatred
to
depressed
and
frightened
americans
in
turn
it
is
helping
the
american
radical
right
to
maintain
its
power
base
as
the
nightmare
of
the
reaganbush
era
comes
to
an
end
hoping
to
rebuild
it
into
their
hopes
for
the
fascist
states
of
america
perhaps
there
are
a
few
among
the
intellectually
challenged
who
percieve
rush
limbaugh
as
a
hatemonger
but
in
my
experience
he
has
been
spreading
laughter
at
the
ludicrous
selfimportance
of
the
left
not
hatred
as
to
mr
bush
you
may
be
correct
about
his
fascist
economic
leanings
mr
reagan
on
the
other
hand
did
his
best
to
reverse
the
fascist
trend
of
government
involvement
in
business
mr
clinton
is
increasing
fascism
in
america
through
businessgovernment
partnership
and
increased
levels
of
taxation
perhaps
you
should
not
have
skipped
your
vocabulary
classes
in
grade
school
and
if
limbaugh
is
not
as
repellant
a
hitler
it
is
only
because
the
radical
right
utilizes
limbaugh
as
its
own
gateway
opiate
one
can
only
wonder
what
the
ultimate
drug
is
they
plan
to
hook
america
on
hmmm
seems
to
me
that
limbaugh
is
not
in
any
way
comparable
to
hitler
because
he
has
not
murdered
six
million
jews
and
many
many
others
out
of
racism
i
come
from
a
mixedrace
family
so
i
am
quite
well
attuned
to
racism
i
dont
hear
any
coming
from
rush
limbaugh
the
only
place
i
hear
racism
coming
from
these
days
and
being
taken
seriously
is
from
the
liberal
left
the
liberal
left
is
the
movement
i
see
trying
to
get
america
hooked
on
the
opiates
of
socialized
medicine
socialized
transportation
socialized
education
etc
the
left
already
has
america
hopelessly
addicted
to
that
liberal
drug
the

letter
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
while
the

not
really
apply
to
either
rush
limbaugh
or
william
jefferson
clinton
if
one

the
fact

is
in

in

in

anyone
missed
it
there
was
no

of
similar
advice
late
last

in

nytimes
eg
even
though
that
advice
was
based
not
on
the
foregone
conclusion
of
enacted

merely
on
the
assumption
that
clinton
would
raise

rates

taxes
contrary

its
nice
to

so
you
feel
that
the
defendents
should
have
been
convicted
regardless
of
the
evidence
now
that
would
truely
be
a
sad
day
for
civil
rights
i
dont
know
about
everybody
else
but
to
me
they
should
have
been
convicted
because
of
the
evidence
which
in
my
mind
was
quite
sufficient
so
you
sat
in
the
court
room

listened
to
the
case
after
careful

you
have

supported
exactly
what

supports

abolishing

ive
never
supported
any

you
have
while
both

may
on

support
the
abolition
of

there
the

stops
one
supports
the
removal
of
a

the
other
a

facade

legitimize

whats
the
difference
in

it
amounts
to
your
saying
its
disgusting
but
should
be
legal
or
someone
else
saying
lets
allow
the
parties
involved
to
decide
what
is
disgusting
or
if
youre
like
me
you
think
that
it
isnt
a
coercive
law

some
children
cant
make

well
clearly
the
report
is
the
first
order
of
business
its
high
on
the
agenda
on
something
that
theyll
discuss
i
think
the

and
general
vessey
will
discuss
the
parameters
of
his
visit
to
vietnam
today
but
the
president
hasnt
drawn
any
conclusions
about
the
report
yet
certainly
its
something
that
he
wants
general
vessey
to
talk
with
the
vietnamese
about
first
q
did
the
president
talk
with
any
republican
senators
yesterday
about
the
stimulus
package
ms
myers
he
spoke
with
senator
dole
q
how
many
times
ms
myers
i
believe
once
during
the
day
and
once
last
night
q
what
was
the
outcome
of
that
ms
myers
theyre
continuing
to
work
toward
some
kind
of
an
agreement
on
a
jobs
package
q
is
it
your
impression
that
senator
dole
is
in
any
way
flexible
on
this
ms
myers
well
i
think
were
hopeful
that
were
going
to
get
some
kind
of
jobs
package
through
the
senate
and
well
continue
to
work
with
senator
dole
and
others
until
we
reach
some
kind
of
an
agreement
q
did
they
discuss
the
vat
tax
ms
myers
i
dont
know
if
that
came
up
q
can
you
check
that
ms
myers
sure
q
so
what
are
they
is
the
president
offering
to
scale
down
his
program
is
that
what
hes
trying
to
do
buy
it
down
to
where
dole
will
sign
on
ms
myers
well
hes
trying
to
protect
as
much
of
it
as
he
can
but
its
important
to
him
to
get
some
kind
of
a
jobs
package
through
the
senate
and
through
congress
now
and
as
soon
as
we
reach
some
conclusions
on
that
well
let
you
know
but
at
the
moment
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
members
of
congress
including
obviously
senator
dole
q
is
he
talking
to
anybody
else
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
he
talked
to
any
other
republicans
yesterday
q
is
he
talking
to
anybody
today
ms
myers
i
dont
think
anything
is
scheduled
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
we
were
led
to
believe
that
the
president
called
mr
dole
on
the
subject
of
russian
aid
and
that
bob
dole
brought
the
conversation
around
to
stimulus
package
is
that
correct
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
has
contacted
several
people
on
russian
aid
i
think
that
it
was
always
expected
that
the
stimulus
package
or
the
jobs
package
will
be
part
of
any
conversation
he
would
have
with
senator
dole
the
primary
objective
of
the
conversation
was
russian
aid
that
was
the
first
order
of
business
but
it
was
both
q
in
the
presidents
mind
are
they
linked
politically
in
that
if
the
republicans
continue
to
reject
the
stimulus
package
he
thinks
it
will
be
harder
to
sell
russian
aid
to
the
american
people
has
he
made
that
argument
ms
myers
i
cant
talk
about
specifically
what
arguments
he
might
have
made
the
president
is
obviously
committed
to
both
he
liked
to
see
a
jobs
package
to
the
american
people
first
but
as
you
know
we
outlined
the
details
of
additional
russian
aid
last
night
in
tokyo
q
but
does
the
president
believe
that
the
stimulus
package
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
persuade
americans
to
vote
for
russian
to
accept
a
vote
for
russian
aid
ms
myers
i
think
that
the
president
is
going
to
continue
to
work
to
pass
the
stimulus
package
to
pass
a
jobs
package
and
were
still
hopeful
that
well
get
some
kind
of
jobs
package
through
the
congress
q
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
president
is
negotiating
now
with
dole
ms
myers
hes
discussing
options
with
him
q
on
the
stimulus
is
it
your
understanding
that
over
the
break
some
democrats
themselves
have
left
the
support
that
they
had
earlier
for
the
package
the
stimulus
package
ms
myers
i
think
we
still
have
wide
support
in
the
senate
for
the
jobs
package
q
but
specifically
that
youve
lost
democrats
other
than
shelby
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
q
what
about
kohl
q
kohl
and
feingold
ms
myers
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
yet
and
well
continue
to
work
with
senators
to
try
to
get
a
majority
to
try
to
bring
the
package
to
a
vote
because
we
believe
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
united
states
senate
support
the
package
q
if
youre
werent
worried
about
kohl
and
feingold
why
did
george
mention
milwaukee
projects
the
other
day
ms
myers
i
think
george
pointed
out
a
number
of
projects
in
a
number
of
states
that
stand
to
be
funded
or
to
lose
funding
if
this
jobs
package
doesnt
pass
q
no
democrats
laughter
ms
myers
ill
let
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
q
does
he
plan
to
talk
to
dole
again
today
or
any
other
republicans
again
today
ms
myers
theres
nothing
specifically
scheduled
but
again
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
does
he
plan
to
put
out
any
more
press
releases
to
any
other
states
today
ms
myers
what
weve
done
is
were
in
the
process
of
breaking
down
the
benefits
of
the
jobs
package
state
by
state
i
think
its
entirely
feasible
that
as
we
sort
of
are
able
to
sum
those
up
well
send
out
press
releases
to
the
various
states
that
suggest
how
their
states
would
benefit
from
this
package
q
will
you
share
those
with
us
ms
myers
sure
as
we
did
yesterday
q
do
you
have
copies
of
the
ones
you
sent
ms
myers
yes
we
made
those
available
yesterday
and
we
certainly
can
continue
to
provide
them
today
q
dee
dee
since
yesterdays
questions
and
subsequent
stories
about
the
vat
what
further
consideration
of
this
issue
has
been
given
ms
myers
nothings
changed
since
yesterday
i
think
the
president
commented
on
it
this
morning
to
say
only
that
it
was
something
he
knew
was
being
considered
by
the
task
force
and
that
he
has
not
made
a
decision
on
and
i
dont
think
we
have
anything
to
add
to
that
q
but
he
also
said
that
business
and
labor
groups
are
telling
him
they
support
it
can
you
tell
us
ms
myers
i
think
that
there
has
been
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
who
supports
it
i
think
the
president
said
that
there
has
been
some
support
among
business
and
labor
groups
i
dont
think
he
said
he
was
directly
contacted
by
them
q
are
we
to
take
that
to
mean
that
the
administration
has
sounded
out
business
and
labor
groups
on
this
ms
myers
i
think
theres
been
plenty
of
public
discourse
on
this
over
the
years
and
even
recently
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
add
to
that
q
in
february
though
the
president
said
that
this
was
something
to
be
considered
or
years
down
the
road
what
has
happened
between
then
and
now
to
cause
this
administration
to
change
its
mind
ms
myers
i
think
as
we
said
yesterday
it
is
something
that
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
theyre
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
on
everything
from
funding
to
specific
options
that
will
be
covered
by
the
presidents
health
care
plan
the
president
has
not
taken
it
up
yet
has
not
made
a
decision
on
it
and
beyond
that
i
dont
have
anything
to
add
q
you
havent
answered
the
question
it
wasnt
being
considered
by
anyone
in
the
white
house
after
the
presidents
comments
in
february
and
george
reaffirmed
that
in
a
briefing
q
and
then
suddenly
q
what
happened
ms
myers
the
working
groups
as
we
have
said
throughout
we
instructed
to
consider
a
wide
variety
of
options
acrosstheboard
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
talked
about
and
that
they
are
clearly
considering
is
some
kind
of
a
valueadded
tax
q
but
the
president
himself
took
this
off
the
table
dee
dee
and
suddenly
it
reappears
and
this
goes
to
the
credibility
of
this
administration
in
a
way
what
has
happened
in
the
meantime
ms
myers
the
president
has
not
looked
at
this
it
hasnt
been
presented
to
him
again
yet
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
as
theyre
looking
at
a
wide
variety
of
options
and
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
and
it
raises
the
question
of
how
independently
the
task
force
is
working
ms
myers
the
task
force
was
instructed
to
consider
all
options
and
theyve
taken
that
mandate
seriously
and
theyre
considering
all
options
q
but
thats
not
the
impression
that
the
president
left
in
february
the
impression
he
left
was
that
this
was
something
that
was
longrange
to
be
looked
at
years
down
the
road
the
clear
implication
of
his
remarks
was
that
this
was
something
that
was
not
on
the
table
not
an
option
q
if
it
changes
ill
tell
you
q
bring
him
on
q
and
you
repeatedly
referred
to
the
presidents
remarks
telling
us
that
those
were
still
in
operation
ms
myers
its
changed
and
we
told
you
laughter
q
but
thats
what
alice
rivlins
comments
and
donna
shalala
comments
were
about
i
mean
that
seemed
like
an
orchestrated
effort
because
you
have
two
independent
cabinet
officers
ms
myers
i
wouldnt
no
alice
rivlins
not
a
cabinet
member
first
of
all
second
of
all
it
was
not
orchestrated
but
clearly
they
both
said
yesterday
and
in
the
last
couple
of
days
that
its
something
thats
being
looked
at
we
confirmed
that
yesterday
and
i
dont
have
anything
to
add
to
that
q
is
it
because
he
has
very
few
options
q
is
this
something
that
it
will
be
incumbent
upon
the
task
force
to
convince
the
president
about
in
other
words
has
the
president
himself
personally
ruled
it
out
and
its
now
up
to
the
task
force
to
convince
him
to
put
it
back
on
the
table
or
is
it
in
fact
back
on
the
table
having
been
placed
there
by
discussions
with
the
president
ms
myers
it
is
not
the
working
groups
mission
at
this
point
to
convince
the
president
of
anything
it
is
their
mission
to
put
before
him
his
options
and
to
explain
the
benefits
and
the
costs
and
the
basic
pros
and
cons
of
each
of
those
options
i
think
that
they
will
certainly
present
the
vat
to
him
in
that
context
and
at
this
point
hes
not
that
presentation
has
not
been
made
but
its
something
that
he
will
hear
and
he
has
not
made
a
decision
on
q
they
will
present
it
to
him
as
one
of
his
options
though
he
specifically
ruled
it
out
ms
myers
correct
q
dee
dee
is
this
more
than
a
trial
balloon
is
this
a
serious
consideration
that
the
working
groups
are
giving
to
this
form
of
taxation
ms
myers
its
simply
a
statement
of
fact
the
working
groups
are
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
on
a
number
of
issues
relating
to
health
care
reform
one
of
the
options
that
theyre
looking
at
is
the
vat
q
dee
dee
when
the
working
groups
were
examining
this
possibility
was
this
on
the
table
during
the
same
time
period
that
you
were
telling
us
that
it
was
not
ms
myers
i
dont
know
what
the
specific
timing
of
their
drafting
of
options
is
i
dont
know
q
who
was
telling
you
that
it
was
not
under
consideration
ms
myers
i
was
referring
back
to
the
presidents
comments
q
have
they
discovered
that
the
sin
taxes
wont
raise
enough
money
to
fund
the
core
benefit
package
ms
myers
no
theres
no
decisions
that
have
been
made
on
how
to
pay
for
the
health
care
plan
q
im
asking
whether
the
projections
ms
myers
theres
a
number
of
options
depending
on
how
the
plan
is
structured
you
cant
decide
how
much
the
plan
is
going
to
cost
until
you
decide
what
the
plan
is
going
to
look
like
and
so
you
cant
discuss
what
financing
options
have
been
ruled
in
our
out
until
you
know
q
dee
dee
weve
been
told
that
they
have
a
computer
models
on
a
number
of
possible
packages
ms
myers
correct
q
the
question
is
whether
they
have
now
determined
whether
sin
taxes
would
not
produce
enough
money
for
even
the
barest
minimum
package
that
is
not
a
very
difficult
computation
ms
myers
it
is
a
question
that
you
know
that
were
not
going
to
answer
until
theres
a
number
of
options
being
considered
it
depends
on
how
the
package
is
structured
the
exact
details
of
the
package
and
the
financing
mechanisms
used
to
pay
for
them
are
all
among
the
decisions
that
have
yet
to
be
made
q
and
when
the
president
has
been
meeting
with
health
care
his
health
care
advisors
which
we
are
told
he
has
been
doing
ms
myers
correct
q
they
have
never
once
said
to
him
these
are
your
funding
options
including
the
vat
he
has
never
heard
the
word
vat
in
his
ms
myers
i
am
not
going
to
comment
on
the
specific
nature
of
the
daily
theyre
not
daily
but
the
quasiregular
briefings
q
well
you
have
ms
myers
i
have
not
other
than
to
say
that
hes
not
considered
the
vat
and
i
think
that
is
a
true
statement
q
no
but
you
said
that
it
has
not
been
presented
to
him
as
an
option
ms
myers
correct
q
that
doesnt
mean
he
hasnt
heard
about
it
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
details
of
whats
discussed
i
think
that
statement
stands
for
itself
q
specific
dee
dee
when
you
say
he
hasnt
looked
at
it
do
you
mean
that
he
hasnt
looked
at
it
in
terms
of
paying
for
medical
coverage
or
hasnt
looked
at
it
in
general
because
back
in
chilicothe
he
was
very
specific
in
defining
how
it
works
what
the
advantages
are
the
whole
thing
it
sounds
like
ms
myers
but
that
was
i
think
in
chilicothe
if
you
go
back
to
his
remarks
there
it
was
a
broader
philosophical
discussion
of
the
tax
structure
and
i
think
the
comments
were
generally
in
reference
to
the
overall
economic
plan
but
clearly
its
something
that
hes
thought
about
in
the
broad
context
i
mean
that
was
clear
in
chilicothe
what
im
saying
is
that
in
the
process
of
the
working
groups
its
something
that
he
hasnt
considered
yet
its
something
that
the
working
groups
will
present
to
him
among
the
number
of
options
and
that
no
decisions
have
been
made
and
im
not
going
to
comment
any
further
on
the
details
of
the
meetings
where
health
care
issues
are
being
discussed
q
its
your
statement
from
this
podium
that
no
discussion
of
this
has
taken
place
you
say
that
no
option
that
the
option
has
not
been
presented
to
him
ms
myers
that
is
correct
q
do
you
stand
by
does
the
white
house
still
stand
by
georges
statement
in
march
that
this
will
not
be
in
the
proposal
ms
myers
no
decisions
have
been
made
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
whats
already
been
said
q
let
me
follow
up
here
do
you
stand
by
what
rivlin
said
yesterday
that
if
any
kind
of
vat
were
to
be
used
or
considered
that
other
changes
to
the
tax
code
would
have
to
be
made
so
that
it
would
be
less
regressive
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
comment
any
further
on
what
might
happen
if
q
but
do
you
stand
by
the
previous
conversations
in
february
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
vat
i
think
the
president
said
youd
exclude
food
and
energy
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
comment
on
the
specific
structure
of
a
decision
that
hasnt
been
made
q
was
the
president
aware
prior
to
donna
shalalas
comments
yesterday
that
this
was
under
consideration
by
the
working
groups
ms
myers
i
dont
know
specifically
what
q
could
you
check
for
us
because
thats
a
real
important
credibility
question
ms
myers
sure
q
since
the
task
force
was
brought
together
this
issue
has
been
discussed
at
the
beginning
and
throughout
as
one
fairly
painless
way
to
raise
a
lot
of
money
were
you
all
kept
in
the
dark
was
the
press
office
kept
in
the
dark
over
the
past
month
and
a
half
when
youve
been
denying
that
a
vat
tax
would
be
considered
that
it
was
actually
on
the
table
over
there
as
an
option
ms
myers
i
think
weve
said
all
that
we
have
to
say
it
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
about
it
yet
and
beyond
that
i
have
nothing
to
add
q
well
sorry
dee
dee
there
are
still
a
couple
of
questions
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
ask
because
we
have
a
problem
with
credibility
here
yours
primarily
what
were
asking
is
if
you
all
were
not
told
at
all
that
this
thing
was
being
considered
while
you
were
coming
out
here
and
telling
us
that
it
was
not
or
if
its
a
case
that
you
were
coming
out
here
and
deliberately
misleading
us
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
that
anyone
has
ever
come
out
here
and
deliberately
misled
you
from
this
podium
ever
ever
q
has
anyone
tried
to
shade
it
a
little
bit
to
indicate
something
has
anybody
told
anybody
to
come
out
ms
myers
were
not
trying
to
shade
answers
or
deliberately
mislead
anybody
ive
said
what
i
have
to
say
about
this
issue
q
all
we
were
trying
to
find
out
ms
myers
i
understand
what
youre
trying
to
find
out
and
ive
given
you
the
answers
helen
q
were
trying
to
find
out
what
changed
what
made
it
an
option
again
thats
the
ms
myers
the
working
groups
were
given
a
broad
mandate
to
investigate
all
options
and
they
are
doing
that
q
yes
but
it
wasnt
an
option
before
how
can
you
investigate
it
if
the
president
has
taken
it
off
the
table
ms
myers
it
is
something
that
theyre
obviously
considering
and
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
on
q
yes
but
he
took
it
off
the
table
in
february
ms
myers
working
groups
are
considering
it
theyll
present
it
to
the
president
at
some
point
and
hell
make
a
decision
q
why
would
they
consider
it
if
he
has
taken
it
off
the
table
ms
myers
its
clearly
on
the
table
q
yes
but
he
took
it
off
the
table
did
he
change
his
mind
ms
myers
its
back
on
the
table
bill
q
did
he
change
his
mind
ms
myers
he
said
this
morning
that
he
hasnt
made
a
decision
about
it
he
obviously
knows
that
its
on
the
table
its
something
that
he
will
look
at
at
some
and
when
we
have
a
decision
on
this
well
let
you
know
q
so
he
must
have
changed
his
mind
right
ms
myers
at
some
point
it
will
be
looked
at
i
mean
q
dee
dee
theres
like
two
options
either
he
changed
his
mind
or
the
working
groups
think
theyre
authority
exceeds
the
presidents
ms
myers
the
working
groups
were
given
a
broad
mandate
to
look
at
all
options
theyve
done
that
q
are
you
going
to
put
out
his
income
tax
ms
myers
yes
there
will
be
something
available
on
his
income
tax
probably
later
this
afternoon
his
return
will
be
available
q
will
there
be
any
kind
of
briefing
to
go
through
it
ms
myers
no
nothings
planned
i
think
someone
will
be
available
probably
not
in
a
briefing
setting
but
to
walk
you
through
the
questions
q
were
used
to
be
walked
linebyline
through
the
presidential
tax
forms
ms
myers
ive
seen
those
briefings
laughter
q
could
we
have
one
ms
myers
no
i
dont
think
there
will
be
any
kind
of
a
formal
briefing
but
there
will
be
somebody
available
to
answer
your
questions
about
it
q
did
they
file
a
joint
form
ms
myers
yes
q
when
did
he
file
it
ms
myers
i
believe
its
being
filed
today
q
dee
dee
is
there
going
to
be
a
backgrounder
for
miyazawa
ms
myers
no
there
will
be
a
readout
after
the
meeting
q
no
backgrounder
today
ms
myers
no
backgrounder
today
q
this
is
complicated
stuff
we
need
help
laughter
ms
myers
we
cant
give
you
taxes
and
miyazawa
all
in
one
day
its
too
confusing
laughter
q
vance
and
owen
have
opened
the
doors
on
the
use
of
force
in
bosnia
theyve
both
said
that
a
they
never
ruled
it
out
and
b
it
might
be
necessary
now
does
that
influence
your
thinking
on
whether
or
not
to
change
your
approach
ms
myers
theres
been
no
change
in
our
policy
towards
bosnia
we
have
always
said
that
wed
consider
q
but
does
that
impact
upon
your
decision
are
they
people
whose
opinions
would
carry
weight
with
you
ms
myers
theyre
people
whose
opinions
carry
weight
certainly
i
mean
the
president
supports
the
process
that
theyve
initiated
but
theres
been
no
change
in
our
policy
for
bosnia
although
were
considering
a
number
of
options
right
now
if
the
serbs
dont
come
back
to
the
negotiating
table
if
they
dont
sign
on
to
some
kind
of
an
agreement
we
will
consider
additional
options
which
weve
been
saying
regularly
q
one
followup
question
then
we
cannot
get
a
straight
answer
from
anyone
in
the
administration
why
do
you
not
set
a
deadline
for
the
serbs
can
you
tell
us
the
strategic
or
tactical
reasons
for
not
giving
them
a
deadline
to
come
to
the
table
ms
myers
were
continuing
to
put
pressure
on
them
every
day
q
which
doesnt
work
so
ms
myers
well
we
think
it
is
having
some
effect
were
going
to
continue
to
tighten
sanctions
as
you
know
we
support
the
omnibus
resolution
we
expect
that
to
come
to
a
vote
on
the
q
you
say
its
having
an
effect
can
you
give
us
any
documentation
ms
myers
id
be
happy
to
provide
somebody
to
talk
to
you
about
the
impact
of
the
sanctions
and
things
like
that
q
theres
been
no
you
have
not
been
able
to
provide
anybody
who
can
tell
us
that
the
sanctions
have
had
any
effect
in
bosnia
serbia
yes
in
bosnia
no
ms
myers
i
think
that
theyve
had
effect
in
serbia
and
we
think
theyve
had
some
effect
in
bosnia
and
again
ill
be
happy
to
provide
somebody
to
walk
you
through
the
details
of
that
if
youd
like
q
we
would
like
to
hear
from
someone
who
can
show
us
what
the
effect
has
been
in
bosnia
we
had
the
briefing
on
all
of
the
terrible
things
that
are
happening
in
belgrade
but
we
havent
seen
anything
that
indicates
an
impact
on
the
fighting
can
you
provide
something
along
those
lines
ms
myers
i
will
see
what
i
can
get
you
q
on
the
extra
russian
aid
that
christopher
announced
this
morning
where
is
that
money
coming
from
ms
myers
well
have
to
work
with
congress
on
the
details
of
that
package
q
so
that
would
be
new
money
that
you
would
hope
to
get
ms
myers
yes
thats
new
money
in
addition
to
the
billion
announced
in
vancouver
so
i
assume
that
you
all
have
seen
the
package
that
was
announced
this
morning
in
tokyo
by
secretary
christopher
q
isnt
there
a
concern
though
about
offering
something
which
you
have
to
get
in
congress
i
mean
that
was
the
concern
with
vancouver
you
didnt
want
to
do
that
ms
myers
the
concern
with
vancouver
was
to
do
something
immediately
which
required
money
that
was
already
approved
in
the
fiscal
budget
what
were
looking
at
now
is
a
little
bit
longerterm
plan
to
build
on
top
of
the
billion
that
we
announced
in
vancouver
this
clearly
will
require
congressional
approval
or
some
of
it
will
anyway
and
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
congress
to
make
that
happen
q
to
what
extent
has
that
been
vetted
or
agreed
to
by
congress
ms
myers
the
president
has
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
members
and
will
continue
to
work
with
them
as
this
process
moves
forward
q
was
christopher
able
to
put
this
package
out
with
a
fair
degree
of
understanding
that
you
will
be
able
to
get
it
through
congress
ms
myers
it
was
created
in
consultation
with
congress
q
in
meeting
with
the
law
enforcement
officials
is
that
does
that
have
a
set
speech
and
a
goal
a
direction
ms
myers
yes
the
president
will
talk
about
and
the
law
enforcement
organizations
are
endorsing
the
presidents
jobs
package
they
believe
particularly
the
summer
jobs
package
will
help
give
kids
something
to
do
q
who
are
they
ms
myers
its
members
or
leadership
from
three
organizations
napo
which
is
the
national
association
of
police
organizations
ibpo
which
is
the
international
brotherhood
of
police
organizations
i
believe
and
iupa
which
is
the
international
union
of
police
associations
q
will
the
fbi
chief
be
there
ms
myers
the
fbi
chief
no
q
or
any
other
federal
law
enforcement
officials
ms
myers
no
it
will
be
the
president
and
these
national
law
enforcement
organization
leaders
q
does
the
billion
announced
today
include
the
million
thats
in
the
fy
budget
for
disarmament
ms
myers
no
the
nunnlugar
money
is
separate
q
so
this
would
be
the
million
thats
in
the
budget
already
plus
another
billion
ms
myers
i
believe
all
of
this
is
on
top
of
the
million
already
in
the
budget
q
is
this
going
to
be
part
of
the
supplemental
or
fiscal
ms
myers
well
work
with
congress
on
the
exact
funding
mechanism
on
exactly
how
this
will
be
paid
for
q
this
billion
on
top
of
ms
myers
on
top
of
million
on
top
of
the
million
nunnlugar
money
we
announced
earlier
q
and
this
is
what
prompted
the
president
to
call
bob
dole
it
was
on
this
tranche
not
on
the
previous
money
he
was
calling
bob
dole
ms
myers
correct
q
is
there
a
briefing
on
miyazawa
ms
myers
there
will
be
a
readout
after
the
meeting
with
miyazawa
tomorrow
q
dee
dee
on
a
totally
unrelated
matter
some
republicans
who
are
active
in
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
are
complaining
about
this
new
cozy
relationship
between
the
white
house
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
there
are
the
town
hall
meeting
the
other
night
the
satellite
and
all
of
this
relationship
does
the
white
house
feel
that
youre
getting
too
close
to
these
chambers
of
commerce
ms
myers
thats
an
interesting
charge
laughter
after
how
many
years
of
democrats
being
accused
of
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
chambers
now
there
are
those
who
would
accuse
us
of
being
too
close
i
think
thats
interesting
but
no
were
thrilled
by
the
support
weve
received
from
the
national
chamber
and
local
chambers
across
the
country
and
well
continue
to
work
with
them
on
this
and
other
initiatives
q
whats
the
status
of
the
president
thinking
about
going
to
this
democratic
retreat
ms
myers
its
on
his
calendar
i
think
hell
almost
certainly
go
q
all
three
days
ms
myers
we
havent
figured
out
exactly
when
hell
be
there
yet
q
is
it
open
to
coverage
ms
myers
no
i
believe
the
whole
thing
is
closed
q
is
he
going
to
have
any
kind
of
address
statement
anything
at
all
on
the
gay
rights
march
on
the
ms
myers
were
still
looking
at
that
we
havent
made
a
final
decision
about
how
well
who
will
make
a
statement
or
what
q
any
meetings
scheduled
with
any
of
the
leaders
ms
myers
nothing
is
scheduled
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
what
about
an
aids
czar
ms
myers
its
coming
q
anything
on
the
weekend
q
theres
been
a
suggestion
that
hes
going
to
this
retreat
to
avoid
having
to
participate
in
the
gay
rights
or
appear
or
have
any
involvement
in
the
gay
rights
march
ms
myers
no
i
think
this
is
something
hes
been
discussing
for
a
long
time
appearing
at
the
senate
democratic
retreat
q
the
weekend
ms
myers
weekend
dont
know
the
only
thing
on
right
now
is
the
radio
address
on
saturday
q
any
travel
plans
ms
myers
if
it
changes
none
right
now
q
hes
not
going
to
be
off
campaigning
for
his
stimulus
package
ms
myers
no
specific
plans
right
now
q
what
about
midweek
anything
likely
ms
myers
its
possible
yes
i
think
its
likely
that
well
travel
next
week
certainly
the
weekend
q
has
he
called
thurmond
about
his
daughter
ms
myers
i
dont
know

q
going
to
name
a
drug
czar
this
weekend
ms
myers
this
weekend

dont

that
going
to
be
focused
on
the
stimulus
package

myers

the
president
good
afternoon
ladies
and
gentlemen
two
months
ago
i
presented
a
comprehensive
plan
to
reduce
our
national
deficit
and
to
increase
our
investment
in
the
american
people
their
jobs
and
their
economic
future
the
federal
budget
plan
passed
congress
in
record
time
and
created
a
new
sense
of
hope
and
opportunity
in
the
country
then
the
shortterm
jobs
plan
i
presented
to
congress
which
would
create
a
half
a
million
jobs
in
the
next
two
years
passed
the
house
of
representatives
two
weeks
ago
it
now
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
united
states
senate
all
of
these
members
of
congress
know
its
time
to
get
the
economy
moving
again
to
get
job
growth
going
again
to
get
a
fast
start
on
the
investments
we
need
to
build
a
lasting
prosperity
unfortunately
a
minority
of
the
members
of
the
united
states
senate
have
used
gridlock
tactics
to
prevent
their
colleagues
from
working
the
will
of
the
majority
on
the
jobs
bill
when
congress
returns
i
ask
every
senator
from
every
state
and
from
both
parties
to
remember
what
is
at
stake
the
issue
is
not
politics
its
people
sixteen
million
of
them
are
looking
for
fulltime
jobs
and
cant
find
them
these
men
and
women
dont
care
about
whos
up
or
down
in
washington
they
care
about
paying
the
rent
and
meeting
the
mortgage
payment
about
putting
food
on
the
table
and
buying
shoes
for
their
children
about
regaining
a
sense
of
dignity
that
comes
from
doing
a
days
work
and
supporting
their
families
and
drawing
a
paycheck
theyre
asking
those
of
us
who
have
the
privilege
of
serving
to
put
aside
politics
and
do
something
now
to
move
our
economy
forward
i
am
prepared
to
do
that
and
i
have
been
working
with
the
senate
to
come
up
with
an
adjusted
package
that
meets
some
of
the
concerns
of
those
who
have
been
blocking
action
on
the
jobs
plan
im
willing
to
compromise
so
long
as
we
keep
the
focus
on
jobs
keep
the
focus
on
growth
and
keep
the
focus
on
meeting
unmet
national
needs
our
opponents
have
been
asking
for
a
smaller
package
today
i
ask
them
to
join
me
in
determining
exactly
what
kind
and
what
size
package
congress
can
approve
that
actually
meets
the
needs
of
the
american
people
but
even
as
we
make
those
reductions
and
the
package
will
be
smaller
i
believe
we
must
address
problems
that
are
on
the
minds
of
millions
of
americans
and
one
in
particular
and
that
is
the
need
to
toughen
law
enforcement
in
our
society
to
deal
with
the
dramatic
rise
in
violent
crime
so
i
will
ask
even
in
this
reduced
package
for
an
additional
million
in
federal
funding
to
help
local
communities
to
rehire
police
officers
who
have
been
laid
off
because
of
the
fiscal
problems
caused
by
the
national
recession
together
with
a
matching
effort
by
local
governments
this
could
put
as
many
as
police
officers
back
on
the
job
and
back
on
the
beat
in
communities
all
across
our
nation
at
a
time
when
too
many
of
our
people
live
in
fear
of
violent
crime
when
too
many
businesses
have
closed
and
too
many
people
have
lost
their
jobs
because
people
are
afraid
to
leave
their
homes
rehiring
thousands
of
officers
is
one
of
the
best
investments
america
can
make
and
i
ask
both
houses
of
congress
to
make
that
investment
in
our
peoples
safety
and
in
their
piece
of
mind
i
believe
in
the
need
for
strong
federal
action
to
keep
the
economy
going
toward
recovery
and
to
create
jobs
make
no
mistake
about
it
i
will
fight
for
these
priorities
as
hard
as
i
ever
have
i
will
never
forget
that
the
people
sent
me
here
to
fight
for
their
jobs
their
future
and
for
fundamental
change
i
want
to
thank
the
police
officers
who
are
here
today
and
tell
you
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
knew
before
they
came
here
that
i
had
determined
to
ask
for
more
money
in
this
jobs
bill
to
rehire
police
officers
they
came
here
because
they
believe
in
the
summer
jobs
portion
of
the
package
and
i
want
them
to
be
free
to
talk
about
that
they
came
here
not
out
of
any
law
enforcement
concern
other
than
the
fact
that
they
wanted
the
kids
in
this
country
to
have
a
chance
to
have
jobs
this
summer
to
have
safer
streets
and
a
brighter
and
more
peaceful
future
i
say
what
i
say
today
not
just
because
its
good
for
law
enforcement
but
because
its
good
for
the
people
who
live
in
these
communities
i
have
always
supported
community
policing
not
only
because
it
helps
to
prevent
crime
and
to
lower
the
crime
rate
but
because
it
cements
better
relationships
between
people
in
law
enforcement
and
the
people
that
theyre
hired
to
protect
it
reduces
the
chances
of
abusive
action
by
police
officers
and
increases
the
chances
of
harmony
and
safe
streets
at
the
same
time
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
we
are
trying
to
do
i
promised
in
my
campaign
that
id
do
everything
i
could
to
put
another
police
officers
on
the
street
over
the
next
four
years
this
makes
a
good
downpayment
on
that
this
keeps
in
mind
the
core
of
the
jobs
package
and
this
will
help
us
to
move
forward
so
i
ask
the
people
in
the
senate
who
have
blocked
the
jobs
bill
lets
work
together
i
can
accept
a
reduced
package
if
you
will
increase
your
commitment
to
safe
streets
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
we
should
reduce
our
commitment
to
summer
jobs
or
to
building
our
infrastructure
or
to
doing
those
other
things
that
will
create
real
and
lasting
prosperity
for
our
people
i
have
done
my
part
now
to
end
the
gridlock
i
ask
you
to
do
yours
i
want
now
to
give
the
people
who
are
here
with
me
on
the
platform
a
chance
to
make
some
remarks
and
to
be
heard
by
the
american
people
beginning
with
janet
reno
the
distinguished
attorney
general
q
mr
president
can
you
tell
us
do
you
think
that
the
jobs
package
could
be
put
in
further
jeopardy
by
controversy
over
the
suggestion
of
a
vat
tax
at
this
point
in
the
congressional
dialogue
the
president
not
at
all
i
think
it
should
have
they
wouldnt
have
any
relationship
one
to
the
other
first
of
all
i
made
absolutely
no
decision
on
that
you
should
know
that
theres
a
lot
of
support
in
the
business
community
and
the
labor
community
people
have
asked
us
to
consider
that
because
of
the
enormous
burden
of
the
present
system
on
many
of
our
major
employers
particularly
many
of
those
that
we
depend
upon
to
generate
jobs
and
to
carry
the
strength
of
this
economy
but
i
have
made
absolutely
no
decision
that
would
even
approach
that
on
that
or
any
other
kind
of
general
tax
q
do
you
personally
believe
that
the
american
public
is
ready
to
pay
for
to
have
another
tax
to
pay
for
health
care
i
mean
apart
from
what
business
and
labor
leaders
have
said
the
president
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
that
i
will
say
this
the
real
issue
is
how
quickly
we
can
recycle
the
benefits
of
all
the
savings
to
cover
the
cost
i
mean
that
is
everyone
knows
that
if
you
do
what
were
proposing
to
do
if
you
streamline
the
insurance
system
if
you
fix
the
system
so
that
theres
no
longer
an
enormous
economic
incentive
to
overutilize
or
overprovide
certain
services
if
you
provide
primary
and
preventive
care
in
places
where
it
isnt
now
every
single
analysis
shows
absolutely
massive
savings
to
the
health
care
system
the
real
question
is
whether
you
can
transfer
those
savings
to
cover
those
who
have
no
coverage
now
or
those
who
have
virtually
no
coverage
so
that
you
provide
people
the
security
i
have
no
idea
the
polls
say
that
but
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
the
polls
that
i
see
in
the
press
that
many
of
you
have
commissioned
they
say
overwhelmingly
the
american
people
want
the
security
of
an
affordable
health
care
system
but
i
dont
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
stimulus
and
it
certainly
shouldnt
have
people
want
a
job
first
and
foremost
they
want
that
more
than
anything
else
q
now
that
youve
announced
your
willingness
to
compromise
on
the
stimulus
package
can
you
tell
us
what
parts
of
your
package
you
consider
vital
and
uncompromisable
i
assume
summer
jobs
is
one
the
president
i
want
the
summer
jobs
i
want
the
highway
program
and
i
want
the
police
program
i
still
intend
let
me
say
this
i
still
intend
to
fully
and
aggressively
push
the
crime
bill
which
did
not
pass
the
congress
last
year
this
is
a
supplement
to
that
not
a
substitute
for
it
in
any
way
but
i
think
we
need
to
do
that
i
think
we
need
the
ryan
white
funds
because
of
the
enormous
health
care
burdens
to
the
communities
that
are
inordinately
and
disproportionately
affected
by
the
problems
of
caring
for
people
with
aids
and
there
are
several
other
things
that
i
think
should
be
done
we
have
to
do
the
agriculture
department
meat
inspectors
the
safety
of
the
public
depends
on
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
things
that
i
dont
i
dont
think
any
of
it
should
be
cut
but
i
have
given
senator
mitchell
and
senator
byrd
i
talked
to
them
and
senator
dole
called
me
yesterday
to
discuss
this
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
call
him
back
i
called
him
back
last
night
in
new
hampshire
and
we
discussed
this
and
i
basically
asked
them
to
talk
today
and
said
that
i
would
not
make
any
statements
about
any
specifics
until
at
least
they
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
see
whether
or
not
they
could
reach
some
accord
so
i
dont
want
to
be
any
more
specific
than
i
have
been
already
and
lets
see
if
they
can
talk
it
out
q
when
you
talked
to
senator
dole
and
senator
mitchell
did
you
tell
them
about
your
increase
also
that
million
that
you
want
that
as
part
of
the
package
the
president
i
did
i
told
senator
i
left
word
for
senator
mitchell
last
night
about
it
when
i
talked
to
senator
dole
i
dont
remember
for
sure
i
do
not
believe
i
mentioned
it
but
i
did
tell
him
that
i
was
prepared
to
reduce
the
package
and
i
wanted
to
break
the
gridlock
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
working
on
a
reformulation
of
it
so
that
in
the
hope
that
it
would
become
even
more
focused
on
jobs
and
the
kinds
of
issues
that
i
thought
the
american
people
wanted
us
to
address
and
this
is
certainly
consistent
with
that

defending
is
our
right
to

even
denounce
them
let
me
explain
something
to
you
environmental
policy
and
industrial
policy
must
go
hand
in
hand
our
nation
and
indeed
our
planet
cannot
afford
to
continue
ignoring
this
as
was
done
over
the
last
twelve
years
our
industrialenvironmental
position
has
been
downright
shameful
we
must
have
active
government
support
of
the
key
industries
such
as
telecommunications
microelectronics
medical
biotech
and
environmental
tech
meanwhile
weed
out
old
inneficient

its

get
really
really

the

on

we
live
should
be

it
just
so
happens
that
that
it
takes
money
to
make
this
country
work
to
provide
the
services
that
people
need
and
to
help
solve
the
problems
that
need
to
be
solved
granted
some
things
can
probably
be
done
more
efficiently
for
less
money
and
should
be
but
some
things
are
going
to
cost
more
money
and
im
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
everyone
whining
about
taxes
all
the
time
you
want
to
live
in
my
country
you
pay
your
fair
share
i
cant
believe
what
hypocrites
people
are
when
they
ask
people
to
give
up
their
lives
for
their
country
and
then
complain
about
taxes
if
youre
willing
to
send
me
off
to
die
for
some
stupid
obsession
with
fighting
an
enemy
which
at
best
doesnt
affect
us
and
at
worst
really
should
be
our
friend
then
you
have
no
right
to
tell
me
you
shouldnt
pay
taxes

yes
basic
health
is
a
human
right
which
people
are
entitled
to
if
these

arent

enough
for
you
then
i
guess
weve
found
something
better
than
capitalism
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
capitalist
system
and
if
something
be
it
socialism
or
anything
else
works
better
then
i
say
let
capitalism
die
make
love
not
war
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
is
possible
to
be
a
male
and
a
feminist
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
against
or
to
deny
equal
opportunity
to
a

of
the

is
just
plain
wrong

is

certainly

what
came

reporting
was
that
the

and
now
those

we
probably
agree
on

more
than
you
thinkwelfare
was
invented
to
solve
a
problem
of
the
but
the
poverty
is
now
so
much
worse
and
our

has
been
so
eroded
that
it
just
cant
keep

any

you

since
your

has
almost
collapsed
excuse
me
my
philosophy
you
dont
have
any
idea
what
my
philosophy
is
the
american
economy
has
had
its
ups
and
downs
through
a
number
of
prevailing
economic
philosophies
but
then
economics
is
hardly
a
science
in
my
lifetime
your
philosophy
socialism
masquerading
as
a
liberal
welfare
state
has
been
in
ascendancy
no
i
mean
exactly
what
i
wrotethe
welfare
system
of
the
new
deal
is
wholly
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
current
state
of
affairs
absolutely
so
the
response
of
socialists
is
take
us
even
further
into
socialism
whether
or
not
the
fathers
work
is
not
germane
to
single
mothers
very
true
but
the
promotion
of
casual
sexuality
is
something
that
plays
a
part
in
the
single

problem
ill
buy
thatand
theres
lots
of
reasons
for
it
extremely
far
down

no
your

utterly
dominated

now
my
subculture
my
were
getting
personal
the
only
subculture
i
see
dominating
the
tv

industries
is
money
if
youll
buy
it
theyll
sell
it
and
as
recent
movements
to
boycott
tv
advertisers
have
shown
theyre
very
sensitive
about
what
sells
whatever
happened
to
personal
responsibility
anyway
or
am
i
personally
responsible
for
the
decline
in
that
too
to
the
extent
that
people
have
been
encouraged
to
not
be
responsible
for
themselves
yes
come
on
you
and
i
both
know
that
the
major
problem
of
this
society
today
isnt
a
lack
of
employment
its
a
lack
of
people
willing
to
work
huh
tell
that
to
the
single
mother
i
know
who
was
laid
off
from
her
job
at
a
hospital
and
now
works
fulltime
minimum
wage
jobs
to
barely
be
able
to
support
herself
and
her
kid
barely
hey
shes
too
proud
to
go
on
public
assistance
but
the
only
jobs
she
can
find
are
menial
and
with
no
benefits
and
no
career
path
eitherthey
find
excuses
to
lay
people
off
and
hire
new
ones
rather
than
give
raises
and
perks
and
why
not
its
a
lot
cheaper
oddly
enough
all
the
unskilled
or
semiskilled
people
i
know
manage
to
find
employment
almost
immediately
maybe
she
needs
to
move
to
a
cheaper
part
of
the
country
where
jobs
are
plentiful
and
the
cost
of
living
is
lower
the
west
side
of
chicago
is
about
as
cheap
as
it
getssqualor

tell
me
about
all
these

its

sir
inexpensive
housing
not
exactly
cheap
but
not
los

either
lots
of
employment
and
utterly
surrounded
by
socialists
well
i
suppose
thats
the
sort
of
environment
that
would
attract
socialists
or
at
least
not
dissuade
them
no
its
that
areas
with
a
lot
of
wealthy
breed
socialists
all
the
spoiled
rich
kids
feeling
guilty
about
their
wealth
but
not
guilty
enough
to
give
it
away
they
just
look
for
politicians
to
take
my
more
limited
wealth
away
i
see
a
lot
of
people
willingnay
eagerto
work
what
i
dont
see
is
a
system
that
makes
it
at
all
feasible
to
do
so
its
not
just
welfare
which
nobody
enjoys
but
there
just
arent
the

any

authorities
said
much
of
the
material
collected
by

was
confidential
information
obtained
illegally
from

they
also
alleged
that

was
sold
separately
to

in

to
allegations

according

justify

disguised
payments
to

for
more
than
years

funneling
a

to
beverly

then
paid

his

hochman
a

also

of

appointed
by
thensen
pete

to
secretly
make

in

hochman
is
a
former
regional
president
of
the
antidefamation
league
the
league
which
initially
cooperated
with
police
has
denied
repeatedly
that
its
intelligencegathering
operation
broke
any
laws
league
officials
will
not
confirm
or
deny
whether
bullock
was
an
employee
and
have
said
they
simply
traded
information
with
police
departments
about
people
who
might
be
involved
in
hate
crimes
but
in
an
affidavit
filed
to
obtain
warrants
for
thursdays
searches
san
francisco
police
alleged
that
adl
employees
were
apparently
less
than
truthful
in
providing
information
during
an
earlier
search
conducted
without
a
warrant
david
lehrer
executive
director
of
the
los
angeles
adl
office
said
the
organization
has
not
violated
the
law
there
is
nothing
nefarious
about
how
we
operate
or
what
we
have
done
he
said
our
record
speaks
for
itself
the
police
affidavit
contends
that
lehrer
had
sole
control
of
a
secret
fund
used
to
pay
for
factfinding
operations
lehrer
according
to
the
documents
signed
checks
from
the
account
under
the
name
l
patterson
an
adl
official
said
the
account
was
used
to
pay
for
subscriptions
to
a
wide
variety
of
extremist
publications
that
might
balk
at
sending
them
directly
to
the
antidefamation
league
bullock
who
has
been
collecting
intelligence
for
the
adl
for
nearly
years
defended
his
efforts
during
a
lengthy
interview
with
san
francisco
police
he
said
that
he
gathered
names
from
many
sources
and
entered
them
into
his
computer
under
headings
such
as
skins
and
pinkos
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
under
surveillance
i
might
never
see
or
call
up
on
of
them
again
bullock
said
and
it
doesnt
mean
anything
that
theyre
in
the
files
its
not
a
threat
to
anyones
civil
rights
that
a
name
appears
in
my
files
under
say
pinko
in
recent
years
bullock
worked
closely
with
san
francisco
police
officer
tom
gerard
who
fled
to
the
phillippines
last
fall
after
he
was
questioned
by
the
fbi
in
the
case
a
former
cia
employee
gerard
supplied
bullock
with
criminal
records
and
department
of
motor
vehicles
information
such
as
home
addresses
vehicle
registration
physical
characteristics
and
drivers
license
photographs
using
files
gathered
for
the
antidefamation
league
gerard
and
bullock
also
provided
information
to
the
south
african
government
receiving
over
four
years
the
documents
show
the
file
on
times
staff
writer
kraft
which
was
apparently
sold
to
the
south
african
government
provides
some
insight
into
the
hitandmiss
nature
of
the
spy
operation
the
file
notes
that
krafts
articles
appear
frequently
in
the
times
and
are
well
researched
and
written
but
little
else
about
the
file
is
accurate
the
brief
entry
confuses
the
times
kraft
with
another
scott
kraft
and
provides
the
south
african
government
with
the
wrong
krafts
physical
description
photograph
and
other
personal
information
nevertheless
the
documents
provide
illuminating
details
of
how
bullock
for
decades
infiltrated
all
manner
of
organizations
from
skinheads
to
leftwing
radicals
searching
regularly
through
the
trash
of
target
groups
using
antidefamation
league
funds
he
also
ran
his
own
paid
informants
under
code
names
such
as
scott
and
scumbag
he
worked
closely
with
police
officers
up
and
down
the
coast
exchanged
information
with
the
fbi
and
worked
with
federal
agencies
including
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
it
was
bullocks
work
as
a
paid
informant
for
the
fbi
while
spying
on
behalf
of
the
antidefamation
league
and
the
south
african
government
that
proved
his
undoing
the
fbi
learned
that
he
was
an
agent
of
a
foreign
government
and
began
investigating
leading
to
the

vows

with

by
richard

staff
writer
san

the
antidefamation
league
defended
its
record
as
a
civil
rights
group
friday
and
said
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
who
are
investigating
whether
the
organization
collected
confidential
police
information
on
citizens
and
groups
but
san
francisco
dist
atty
arlo
smith
said
that
antidefamation
league
employees
involved
in
intelligence
gathering
could
face
many
felony
counts
of
receiving
confidential
files
eavesdropping
tax
violations
and
conspiracy
police
have
accused
the
antidefamation
league
of
not
being
truthful
about
its
spying
operations
which
collected
information
on
more
than
individuals
and
political
groups
across
the
political
spectrum
hundreds
of
pages
of
documents
released
by
prosecutors
thursday
show
that
the
adl
maintained
a
nationwide
intelligence
network
and
kept
files
on
political
figures
even
so
smith
suggested
that
if
the
antidefamation
league
shut
down
its
spy
operation
prosecutors
would
take
that
into
account
when
deciding
what
charges
to
file
in
a
statement
released
in
washington
national
director
abraham
h
foxman
described
the
adl
as
a
jewish
defense
agency
which
has
fought
to
protect
all
minorities
from
bigotry
and
discrimination
for
years
foxman
said
the
organization
is
regarded
as
a
credible
source
on
extremist
groups
and
has
a
tradition
of
routinely
providing
information
to
police
journalists
academics
government
officials
and
the
public
it
has
never
been
the
policy
of
the
adl
to
obtain
information
illegally
he
said
like
other
journalists
in
order
to
protect
the
confidentiality
and
physical
safety
of
its
sources
adl
will
not
comment
on
the
nature
or
identity
of
any
source
of
information
foxman
said
the
antidefamation
league
refused
to
acknowledge
that
one
of
its
longtime
employees
roy
bullock
was
anything
more
than
a
private
individual
who
is
alleged
to
be
an
adl
informant
among
the
documents
released
by
prosecutors
were
detailed
statements
showing
how
the
adl
funneled
weekly
payments
to
bullock
through
beverly

attorney
bruce
i
hochman
roy
would
penetrate

and
needed
this

to
be
distanced
from
adl
hochman
told
a
san
francisco
police
investigator
hochman
could
not
be
reached
friday
at
his
home
or
office
for
comment
despite
the
antidefamation
leagues
assertion
that
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
san
francisco
police
said
the
group
did
not
turn
over
all
pertinent
documents
during
a
voluntary
search
of
the
groups
offices
in
los

and
san

last

a
second
round
of
searches
thursday
this
time
with

produced
a
vast
quantity
of
records
primarily
dealing
with
financial
transactions
smith
said
further
searches
may
be
necessary
and
it
will
be
at
least
a
month
before
any
charges
are
filed

mr
stephanopoulos
good
afternoon
q
could
we
do
this
on
the
lawn
mr
stephanopoulos
that
would
be
nice
lets
go
out
to
the
cherry
blossoms
well
do
like
the
president
q
is
the
stimulus
package
dead
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
not
q
can
you
tell
us
more
about
the
dole
talks
you
said
it
was
a
good
visit
but
no
compromise
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
the
president
had
a
good
talk
with
senator
dole
last
night
i
think
that
as
we
said
before
there
were
no
specific
compromises
on
either
side
although
it
was
a
very
good
discussion
about
the
jobs
package
and
about
other
issues
as
well
as
you
know
the
president
first
called
senator
dole
i
believe
tuesday
night
to
talk
about
the
russian
aid
package
they
did
not
speak
senator
dole
called
him
back
wednesday
morning
when
the
president
was
out
instead
he
spoke
with
tony
lake
and
at
the
close
of
that
conversation
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
the
president
about
the
jobs
and
stimulus
package
they
finally
talked
about
that
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
close
of
that
discussion
they
said
that
they
would
have
another
talk
last
night
which
they
did
when
the
senator
was
up
in
new
hampshire
and
although
there
were
no
specific
compromises
made
on
either
side
they
did
say
that
they
would
continue
to
have
some
discussions
and
thats
where
we
are
q
well
who
is
giving
in
where
is
it
standing
are
both
making
concessions
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
its
at
that
phase
no
compromise
has
been
made
as
the
president
has
said
consistently
he
intends
to
come
forward
with
an
adjusted
package
he
believes
in
the
package
but
he
believes
that
if
its
going
to
take
adjustments
to
get
the
minority
to
release
it
hes
willing
to
make
those
adjustments
q
on
the
subject
of
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
boy
q
can
we
stay
on
this
for
one
more
minute
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
we
have
a
problem
with
the
five
minutes
q
i
know
no
decisions
have
been
made
but
what
would
lead
the
health
group
to
believe
that
a
vat
might
be
necessary
mr
stephanopoulos
sorry
andrea
im
not
going
to
go
down
that
road
no
decisions
have
been
made
as
the
president
said
this
morning
a
number
of
groups
a
number
of
members
of
congress
a
number
of
other
organizations
have
recommended
that
this
be
looked
at
the
working
group
is
looking
at
it
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
to
follow
have
they
done
that
directly
through
him
have
labor
and
business
groups
been
in
touch
with
the
president
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
although
theres
a
lot
of
people
who
have
public
decisions
in
support
of
the
vat
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
at
the
meetings
that
hes
had
with
his
own
task
force
advisers
have
they
discussed
the
funding
issue
and
what
the
possible
options
would
be
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
that
that
has
been
presented
for
a
decision
no
q
not
for
a
decision
but
has
it
been
discussed
as
an
option
mr
stephanopoulos
again
there
are
a
lot
of
levels
of
briefing
i
do
not
believe
that
the
vat
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
okay
this
is
something
for
you
to
decide
on
q
youre
not
saying
he
didnt
know
it
was
being
considered
though
are
you
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
said
its
being
considered
q
he
knew
that
q
but
has
he
discussed
that
with
his
advisers
thats
what
im
asking
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
said
its
being
considered
i
do
not
know
what
level
of
discussion
there
has
been
over
the
vat
it
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
i
dont
even
know
that
its
q
but
he
didnt
say
he
was
considering
did
he
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
is
not
i
think
were
getting
into
something
of
a
metaphysical
debate
right
here
what
is
considered
q
well
he
is
the
one
who
said
i
havent
reviewed
it
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
true
that
is
what
i
just
repeated
q
george
is
there
any
concern
here
that
as
a
result
of
the
definite
statement
he
made
in
february
and
the
promise
that
if
it
were
to
be
considered
hed
let
us
know
and
having
it
trickle
out
the
way
it
did
that
there
may
now
be
the
development
of
a
credibility
gap
on
this
issue
and
others
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
i
mean
it
is
now
public
knowledge
that
this
is
being
considered
q
is
he
or
you
at
all
embarrassed
about
the
absolute
statements
that
were
made
from
this
platform
to
the
effect
that
it
was
off
the
table
and
was
not
being
considered
and
then
to
have
it
come
out
not
from
you
people
but
mr
stephanopoulos
well
wait
a
second
it
came
out
from
the
administration
what
are
you
talking
about
q
what
im
saying
is
though
that
the
president
said
he
would
let
us
know
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
you
people
then
said
you
said
i
believe
that
its
not
going
to
be
on
the
program
mr
stephanopoulos
on
march
q
on
march
mr
stephanopoulos
circumstances
change
q
well
i
understand
but
we
have
to
find
that
out
by
rooting
around
in
the
fine
print
of
an
interview
mr
stephanopoulos
rooting
around
i
know
you
did
do
a
very
good
job
there
to
read
the
usa
today
article
but
this
is
laughter
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
i
mean
that
is
common
anytime
you
guys
write
a
story
that
has
an
unattributed
quote
from
somebody
in
the
clinton
administration
the
headline
is
ill
look
at
it
right
here
and
ap
story
clinton
wants
more
money
for
spying
q
what
about
his
remark
that
if
it
were
being
considered
hed
tell
us
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
administrations
concerned
and
hed
let
you
know
q
and
did
he
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
absolutely
what
did
he
say
this
morning
q
it
had
to
be
dragged
out
of
you
here
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
of
me
we
had
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
we
had
the
secretary
of
health
of
human
services
say
it
was
being
considered
that
is
his
administration
that
is
his
administration
policy
q
were
these
authorized
trial
balloons
or
were
they
orchestrated
leaks
i
mean
what
was
the
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
questions
they
answered
the
questions
q
youre
saying
here
that
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
that
you
more
or
less
made
it
clear
yesterday
you
were
considering
it
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
i
was
very
clear
painfully
clear
q
was
there
a
particular
political
strategy
in
making
it
clear
the
administration
is
considering
a
new
tax
increase
on
tax
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
was
just
this
issue
is
being
considered
they
were
asked
if
it
was
being
considered
they
answered
that
it
was
being
considered
q
george
the
new
york
times
q
why
do
it
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
q
the
new
york
times
reports
today
that
secretary
reich
and
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
used
apples
and
oranges
numbers
in
order
to
portray
last
months
unemployment
figures
in
a
way
that
was
supportive
of
the
presidents
job
stimulus
bill
but
which
turned
out
to
be
totally
false
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
was
totally
false
but
i
think
laughter
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
did
grant
that
it
was
an
inappropriate
mixing
and
they
say
that
q
the
question
is
is
the
president
concerned
about
behavior
that
amounts
to
corrupting
government
data
and
whats
he
doing
about
it
if
so
mr
stephanopoulos
the
chief
economist
has
said
that
a
mistake
was
made
it
wont
happen
again
and
thats
the
end
of
the
matter
q
isnt
that
the
same
information
that
goes
to
the
president
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
two
separate
pieces
of
information
i
think
thats
where
the
confusion
was
q
when
did
you
all
first
learn
about
this
mistake
that
was
made
mr
stephanopoulos
i
read
the
article
this
morning
q
and
as
far
as
you
know
is
the
president
aware
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
q
and
was
he
aware
of
it
before
he
read
about
it
in
the
new
york
times
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
not
to
my
knowledge
q
did
you
ever
hear
about
it
before
this
morning
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
q
wasnt
the
president
given
an
erroneous
spin
on
this
for
his
own
purpose
for
his
speeches
for
his
arguments
mr
stephanopoulos
well
again
im
not
sure
both
statements
are
true
what
the
labor
department
has
granted
is
that
mixing
them
in
one
sentence
essentially
was
misleading
they
said
it
was
a
mistake
they
said
they
wouldnt
do
it
again
q
did
they
drop
it
is
this
something
that
you
choose
to
spin
or
make
an
issue
of
mr
stephanopoulos
whenever
fewer
people
are
out
of
work
were
gratified
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
need
to
get
this
jobs
package
going
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
for
a
minute
you
said
that
the
president
plans
to
come
forward
with
an
amendment
is
the
timetable
still
what
it
was
that
the
amendment
would
be
laid
down
on
monday
and
voted
on
on
tuesday
or
did
he
in
the
conversation
with
dole
talk
about
the
possibility
of
putting
that
off
for
a
few
more
days
to
give
more
time
for
the
discussion
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
at
this
point
theres
no
changes
in
the
schedule
at
all
i
dont
know
that
they
discussed
the
timing
like
that
q
do
you
believe
that
youre
closer
or
getting
closer
this
week
than
you
were
last
week
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
believe
that
were
going
to
pass
a
jobs
package
the
president
is
prepared
to
make
adjustments
in
order
to
get
that
to
happen
i
dont
know
where
the
votes
are
on
cloture
at
this
particular
time
i
dont
know
whats
going
to
happen
until
we
have
a
vote
but
the
president
believes
deeply
in
this
jobs
package
and
wants
to
get
it
done
q
has
there
been
any
indication
that
this
situation
has
changed
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
it
well
know
when
the
votes
are
taken
q
george
last
week
you
said
that
there
are
or
various
people
in
the
administration
were
saying
that
you
couldnt
go
through
dole
you
were
going
to
have
to
try
and
go
around
him
because
he
was
immovable
on
this
subject
of
a
compromise
or
at
least
the
compromise
he
wanted
was
not
anything
like
the
one
that
you
could
accept
this
week
youre
talking
to
him
is
that
because
youve
realized
that
the
peeling
off
effort
wasnt
going
to
work
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
because
senator
dole
wanted
to
talk
to
the
president
about
the
stimulus
package
q
he
initiated
the
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
secretary
reich
this
morning
said
that
in
fact
the
president
is
not
willing
to
compromise
on
this
bill
at
all
you
say
hes
making
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
thats
exactly
what
he
said
i
think
he
said
he
didnt
have
any
indication
that
there
was
any
compromises
yet
or
that
there
would
be
a
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
but
if
he
has
to
make
adjustments
to
get
it
through
he
will
q
officials
here
yesterday
said
that
panetta
was
working
on
a
series
of
adjustments
that
might
be
made
public
before
the
actual
vote
mr
stephanopoulos
its
possible
q
today
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
that
will
happen
but
i
think
that
its
very
possible
that
well
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
or
senate
democrats
will
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
in
order
to
get
it
passed
q
as
we
understood
his
conversations
with
dole
the
first
one
was
some
discussion
of
this
and
ill
get
back
to
you
tonight
with
some
details
or
some
adjustments
or
whatever
the
phrase
is
did
he
offer
him
some
details
or
some
adjustments
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
question
of
how
detailed
i
mean
i
think
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
package
last
night
subsequent
to
their
conversation
yesterday
afternoon
i
believe
that
there
will
be
followup
discussions
today
in
the
senate
not
necessarily
between
the
president
and
senator
dole
and
let
me
just
reiterate
neither
side
has
made
specific
compromises
at
this
date
when
we
have
something
well
let
you
know
and
im
not
suggesting
that
senator
dole
has
accepted
anything
that
weve
talked
about
or
that
weve
offered
anything
in
a
hard
way
q
what
are
the
followup
discussions
if
not
the
president
and
dole
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
senator
mitchell
is
going
to
talk
to
senator
dole
q
is
that
a
threat
laughter
q
did
the
president
say
to
senator
dole
all
right
how
about
this
number
as
an
overall
size
or
did
dole
say
to
the
president
i
can
go
as
high
as
this
did
they
talk
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
a
negotiation
in
that
respect
it
was
more
of
a
discussion
about
their
positions
q
did
they
discuss
actual
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
i
know
they
talked
about
the
basic
outlines
of
the
packages
i
think
they
talked
about
the
programs
they
cared
about
i
dont
know
if
they
got
to
the
level
of
this
many
xbillion
dollars
q
does
dole
have
to
sign
off
before
there
is
a
package
mr
stephanopoulos
no
of
course
not
q
did
the
white
house
have
anything
to
do
with
the
protesters
who
showed
up
in
new
hampshire
today
where
senator
dole
was
speaking
was
that
in
any
way
organized
by
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
and
has
the
president
been
in
touch
with
senators
kohl
or
feingold
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
hes
talked
to
them
no
q
george
is
the
president
considering
the
more
palatable
fact
of
having
a
national
sales
tax
instead
of
having
the
haves
having
to
continuously
pay
for
the
havenots
and
is
he
going
to
scrap
his
proposed
tax
on
the
privileged
few
with
the
haves
having
to
pay
for
the
havenots
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
deeply
that
the
tax
rates
on
upper
income
americans
as
he
presented
in
his
budget
should
go
up
and
i
think
for
the
second
half
of
your
question
ill
refer
you
to
my
briefing
from
yesterday
q
george
on
the
subject
of
accuracy
in
information
you
suggested
the
other
day
that
the
stimulus
package
included
money
that
would
solve
the
water
problem
in
milwaukee
apparently
that
is
not
true
its
actually
waste
water
money
mr
stephanopoulos
its
waste
water
money
for
wisconsin
and
some
could
go
to
milwaukee
q
but
it
would
not
affect
the
drinking
water
problem
because
its
waste
water
money
right
mr
stephanopoulos
it
would
affect
the
water
treatment
overall
q
but
the
implication
from
your
statement
the
other
day
was
that
it
would
help
fix
this
disease
problem
in
milwaukee
now
would
you
agree
thats
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
of
the
specifics
i
know
that
it
goes
to
the
overall
water
treatment
in
wisconsin
q
a
leftover
question
from
this
morning
which
was
when
did
the
president
find
out
that
the
task
force
was
deliberating
on
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
i
just
dont
know
i
assume
it
came
up
over
the
last
certainly
between
the
time
that
we
had
commented
on
in
the
past
and
two
days
ago
q
so
sometime
since
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
right
i
dont
know
the
exact
date
q
george
the
president
this
morning
mentioned
that
some
labor
and
business
groups
are
for
the
vat
tax
apparently
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
talks
about
perhaps
the
vat
tax
being
okay
if
it
replaces
the
btu
tax
so
does
the
president
feel
that
perhaps
this
might
be
in
place
of
some
other
tax
hes
proposed
or
is
this
totally
in
addition
to
the
other
taxes
hes
already
proposed
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
weve
said
all
we
have
to
say
about
the
vat
at
this
point
i
mean
theres
just
no
this
is
being
considered
by
the
health
care
working
groups
and
that
is
all
the
president
hasnt
made
any
further
decisions
beyond
that
q
but
it
would
be
to
finance
health
care
it
wouldnt
be
to
replace
some
other
tax
that
finances
it
wouldnt
replace
the
income
tax
for
instance
mr
stephanopoulos
there
have
been
no
discussions
on
that
q
in
terms
of
getting
a
vat
tax
through
congress
senator
doles
press
release
today
said
vat
on
tax
day
do
you
think
does
it
have
a
chance
of
getting
through
congress
would
it
have
a
chance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
no
idea
q
is
that
a
consideration
whether
you
all
put
it
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
that
would
become
a
consideration
if
the
president
were
to
decide
to
do
it
its
not
in
consideration
now
q
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
briefing
that
circumstances
had
changed
and
that
had
caused
the
vat
to
now
be
under
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
what
the
president
referred
to
this
morning
these
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
considered
q
those
are
the
circumstances
that
have
changed
thats
the
only
difference
between
now
and
when
he
emphatically
ruled
it
out
that
groups
have
asked
it
to
be
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
he
said
q
is
that
true
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
was
there
in
fact
some
understanding
that
sin
taxes
would
not
produce
enough
money
for
the
health
care
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
deliberations
q
but
george
mr
stephanopoulos
no
what
the
consideration
is
as
the
president
said
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
you
ought
to
consider
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
q
is
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
since
his
prior
statement
and
your
prior
statement
on
the
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
explain
how
those
groups
how
that
information
got
to
him
that
groups
wanted
it
was
it
just
reading
the
newspaper
or
did
groups
make
presentations
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
groups
as
you
know
the
health
care
task
force
has
met
with
dozens
of
groups
q
but
this
is
the
presidents
knowledge
that
these
groups
had
come
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
referring
to
what
was
coming
to
the
working
groups
obviously
there
have
also
been
published
positions
in
the
newspapers
q
have
certain
groups
briefed
him
on
the
groups
presentations
to
them
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
briefed
him
i
mean
how
detailed
the
briefings
have
been
i
know
that
the
working
groups
decided
to
look
into
this
after
being
pressed
by
these
groups
q
what
kind
of
arguments
did
the
groups
make
that
were
persuasive
enough
that
the
president
would
change
the
position
that
he
had
enunciated
previously
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
its
just
theyve
had
longstanding
positions
that
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
finance
health
care
q
the
president
wasnt
aware
of
those
longstanding
positions
mr
stephanopoulos
he
may
have
been
at
some
level
obviously
hes
been
a
governor
for
a
long
time
and
he
knows
the
basic
arguments
for
and
against
a
vat
tax
q
what
were
trying
to
figure
out
here
youre
telling
us
that
the
only
change
the
only
thing
that
affected
this
change
in
the
presidents
attitude
toward
the
vat
between
february
and
now
mr
stephanopoulos
the
presidents
attitude
hasnt
necessarily
changed
i
mean
he
has
not
made
a
decision
q
i
know
but
the
president
said
that
it
was
off
the
table
so
did
you
and
youre
saying
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
is
the
positions
of
these
groups
except
youre
also
describing
them
as
longstanding
positions
i
dont
see
the
change
if
these
groups
havent
had
any
change
in
their
position
thats
been
made
to
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
well
theyve
made
the
presentations
to
the
health
care
task
force
q
theres
no
relationship
at
all
between
the
fact
that
sin
taxes
that
he
had
said
suggested
in
february
that
he
favored
will
not
produce
enough
revenue
to
finance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
he
ever
suggested
that
they
would
produce
all
the
revenue
q
well
he
suggested
that
he
thought
that
those
were
appropriate
ways
to
finance
health
care
mr
stephanopoulos
he
did
say
that
i
dont
know
that
he
said
anything
to
refute
that
q
but
in
fact
has
the
task
force
discovered
that
there
wouldnt
be
enough
revenue
from
those
taxes
to
finance
the
kind
of
core
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
think
that
the
task
force
ever
suggested
that
there
would
q
george
if
he
advocated
a
vat
tax
would
that
break
his
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
his
programs
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
comment
on
a
hypothetical
situation
q
but
does
that
promise
would
that
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
the
programs
prevent
him
from
seeking
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
made
no
decisions
on
the
vat
tax
when
he
does
well
tell
you
and
well
explain
the
implications
then
q
which
specific
groups
can
you
cite
business
labor
or
otherwise
whose
recommendations
to
the
health
care
task
force
has
prompted
this
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
the
specific
i
just
dont
have
that
q
george
can
you
tell
us
to
what
extend
these
other
alternatives
for
instance
the
employer
tax
or
the
sin
taxes
or
other
financing
options
are
also
still
on
the
table
and
what
these
options
are
mr
stephanopoulos
no
as
members
of
the
task
force
and
representatives
of
the
working
groups
have
said
they
are
looking
at
a
wide
variety
of
options
i
think
that
ira
magaziner
said
that
there
are
different
options
under
consideration
but
im
not
going
to
comment
q
whats
the
scope
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
going
to
comment
on
them
no
q
whats
the
scope
of
the
need
how
much
are
you
talking
about
that
has
to
be
produced
by
one
or
a
combination
of
the
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
the
health
care
task
force
is
looking
at
q
since
theres
not
going
to
be
any
briefing
on
the
miyazawa
visit
two
questions
one
generally
what
does
the
president
hope
to
use
that
meeting
for
but
more
specifically
is
his
task
complicated
by
the
japanese
anger
over
the
vancouver
note
and
the
remark
about
market
access
at
the
press
conference
mr
stephanopoulos
the
vancouver
note
q
does
no
mean
yes
q
yes
and
no
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
i
saw
the
prime
ministers
press
conference
where
he
was
asked
the
question
about
that
note
and
he
gave
a
very
gracious
and
complete
answer
when
he
was
asked
the
question
the
questions
of
trade
are
something
that
certainly
will
be
discussed
between
the
prime
minister
and
the
president
there
is
obviously
a
trade
imbalance
between
japan
and
the
us
that
we
want
to
do
something
about
q
also
in
those
comments
the
prime
minister
made
he
suggested
that
the
united
states
should
come
down
heavy
on
him
in
terms
of
trade
are
you
going
to
oblige
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
president
will
state
our
views
on
trade
very
clearly
and
our
views
on
the
trade
deficit
very
clearly
i
dont
necessarily
want
to
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
prime
ministers
comments
q
that
we
need
specific
export
targets
specific
numerical
targets
is
that
what
hes
going
to
discuss
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
going
to
have
a
broad
discussion
of
a
wide
range
of
trade
issues
i
dont
want
to
get
into
those
specifics
until
after
the
meeting
q
why
q
thats
the
crux
of
the
issue
right
whether
or
not
does
the
president
believe
that
without
specific
numerical
targets
it
is
really
as
he
said
in
his
press
conference
sort
of
hopeless
that
this
is
going
to
change
very
much
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
we
must
have
pressure
on
japan
to
turn
the
trade
imbalance
around
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
specifics
of
how
that
would
be
done
q
but
does
the
president
believe
that
their
stimulus
package
announced
yesterday
will
rectify
the
imbalance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
first
the
president
wants
to
get
a
full
briefing
on
the
stimulus
package
from
prime
minister
miyazawa
himself
and
then
hell
make
the
comment
on
it
q
how
about
the
russian
aid
package
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
about
how
the
us
views
that
secretary
christopher
saying
or
bentsen
saying
the
japanese
may
need
to
do
more
the
japanese
saying
that
thats
not
what
they
heard
mr
stephanopoulos
again
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
in
the
and
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
help
for
russian
reform
russian
democratic
reform
and
i
think
that
so
far
we
had
a
very
good
announcement
out
of
tokyo
and
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
our
allies
for
bilateral
packages
q
do
you
think
the
japanese
need
to
do
more
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
to
do
as
much
as
we
can
q
secretary
christopher
was
asked
today
on
the
today
show
this
morning
what
he
thought
of
margaret
thatchers
comments
on
the
bosnia
policy
and
he
said
its
a
rather
emotional
response
mr
stephanopoulos
over
an
emotional
issue
q
right
to
an
emotional
problem
does
the
white
house
condone
that
kind
of
remark
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
secretary
christophers
remarks
speaks
for
itself
the
president
believes
also
that
this
is
a
deeply
troubling
situation
that
were
trying
to
find
answers
for
q
but
that
specific
rather
emotional
response
specific
term
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
speaks
for
itself
q
in
connection
with
that
doesnt
it
seem
that
with
the
numbers
of
people
who
are
being
killed
at
this
very
moment
is
it
good
american
policy
to
put
off
some
decisions
that
might
be
made
now
to
help
boris
yeltsin
win
a
referendum
mr
stephanopoulos
for
example
q
to
take
stronger
action
to
take
military
action
air
strikes
anything
that
can
be
done
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
what
must
be
done
now
is
to
push
harder
for
sanctions
he
is
also
as
you
know
the
administration
has
been
discussing
lifting
the
arms
embargo
he
believes
those
are
the
appropriate
ways
to
increase
pressure
at
this
time
q
what
is
your
response
to
the
critics
who
would
say
that
the
us
is
now
stymied
by
trying
to
help
boris
yeltsin
retain
the
presidency
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
wrong
were
pressing
hard
for
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
were
pressing
hard
for
increased
sanctions
and
were
talking
to
our
allies
about
the
arms
embargo
q
you
were
putting
great
store
in
vance
and
owen
getting
people
to
agree
to
that
now
vance
and
owen
have
both
said
that
military
force
to
some
extent
would
be
acceptable
does
that
change
your
thinking
mr
stephanopoulos
clearly
were
going
to
listen
to
whatever
people
who
have
put
so
much
time
into
a
situation
have
to
say
but
at
this
point
the
president
is
moving
forward
on
sanctions
and
talking
about
the
arms
embargo
q
a
followup
on
a
dee
dee
comment
this
morning
she
said
she
would
be
able
to
provide
some
administration
officials
who
could
document
the
effect
the
sanctions
are
having
in
bosnia
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
or
do
you
have
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
what
she
said
q
thats
exactly
what
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
true
but
what
she
said
we
would
look
into
the
situation
of
what
kind
of
evidence
can
be
provided
in
bosnia
obviously
if
there
are
connections
between
the
bosnian
serbs
and
the
serbs
in
belgrade
and
we
are
tightening
the
screws
on
the
serbs
in
belgrade
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
i
do
not
know
day
by
day
minute
by
minute
what
kind
of
help
is
being
given
between
the
two
and
what
the
exact
effect
has
been
but
clearly
we
are
slowing
the
shipment
of
goods
into
belgrade
we
are
having
an
effect
on
the
serbs
there
what
kind
of
effect
that
will
eventually
have
on
the
bosnian
serbs
i
dont
know
but
one
thing
i
would
say
is
if
it
were
having
no
effect
at
all
i
dont
know
why
theyd
be
fighting
it
so
much
q
are
the
first
ladys
tax
returns
going
to
be
released
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
joint
tax
return
and
it
will
be
probably
later
today
q
is
the
president
considering
signing
an
executive
order
banning
discrimination
against
homosexuals
in
the
federal
work
force
as
part
of
the
gay
rights
march
here
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
theres
any
proposal
for
that
at
this
time
not
that
i
know
of
q
its
something
that
the
president
promised
during
the
campaign
that
he
would
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
not
seen
any
i
dont
think
its
anything
thats
on
his
plate
right
now
q
is
he
meeting
with
gay
rights
leaders
at
any
point
on
this
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
on
this
issue
i
assume
that
hell
meet
with
representatives
of
the
gay
and
lesbian
community
sometime
soon
as
he
meets
with
representatives
of
lots
of
different
groups
and
communities
q
do
you
know
if
thats
scheduled
mr
stephanopoulos
its
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
laughter
q
its
a
good
thing
you
asked
q
whos
probably
going
to
be
there
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
q
how
long
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
thats
all
i
know
q
do
you
know
if
its
at
pm
tomorrow
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
time
it
is
i
dont
even
know
for
sure
if
its
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
environmental
groups
have
asked
him
to
make
a
major
speech
next
week
of
some
kind
is
that
going
to
happen
do
you
know
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
asked
but
i
think
the
president
has
always
planned
as
he
did
last
year
to
give
a
speech
on
earth
day
and
i
expect
that
he
will
if
its
not
exactly
on
earth
day
it
might
be
a
day
before
or
something
like
that
q
is
he
planning
to
sign
or
announce
the
signing
of
the
biodiversity
treaty
in
connection
with
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
the
specific
timing
of
something
like
that
but
its
certainly
something
under
discussion
and
something
weve
been
working
on
q
campaign
finance
reform
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
it
q
do
you
think
it
will
be
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
the
biodiversity
treaty
is
something
youre
working
on
i
missed
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
something
were
working
on
he
asked
if
it
was
ready
to
be
signed
and
i
said
i
didnt
know
anything
about
that
but
its
something
weve
certainly
been
working
on
q
do
you
know
what
organizations
might
be
represented
in
this
meeting
with
the
gay
and
lesbian
groups
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
q
do
you
know
if
he
is
going
to
reconsider
being
out
of
town
on
the
day
of
the
march
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
to
be
at
the
senate
meeting
in
jamestown
and
i
believe
hes
also
going
to
be
giving
a
speech
to
the
american
association
of
newspaper
publishers
in
boston
on
sunday
as
he
did
last
year
q
would
you
have
told
us
if
she
had
not
pressed
you
on
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
on
what
q
on
the
gays
mr
stephanopoulos
when
we
went
through
the
presidents
schedule
for
the
day
certainly
q
george
what
day
is
the
publishers
speech
is
that
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
sunday
q
and
saturday
hell
be
in
jamestown
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
so
youre
just
going
to
be
in
jamestown
for
one
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
im
not
sure
i
dont
know
how
long
the
senate
thing
goes
it
might
go
overnight
i
just
dont
know
q
you
would
have
made
the
gay
meeting
public
right
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
if
we
had
the
meeting
i
dont
know
about
open
to
the
press
but
we
would
have
told
you
about
it
q
i
mean
because
it
is
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
first
time
in
history
a
president
has
met
in
the
oval
office
with
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
say
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
oval
office
laughter
but
i
didnt
im
not
say
that
its
not
but
i
didnt
say
that
it
was
laughter
q
at
the
white
house
in
the
bush
administration
gay
officials
were
invited
to
a
bill
signing
ceremony
and
the
white
house
had
to
repudiate
having
done
that
so
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
q
certainly
not
q
what
marching
orders
did
the
president
give
to
general
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
they
had
a
very
good
discussion
for
about
half
an
hour
today
he
wanted
the
most
important
thing
was
he
had
a
full
accounting
for
american
pows
and
mias
he
will
obviously
look
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
new
document
the
president
stressed
that
he
wanted
the
fullest
possible
accounting
and
said
that
only
when
we
have
that
can
we
even
consider
any
changes
in
our
policy
towards
vietnam
hell
be
looking
at
vietnams
response
to
the
questions
raised
by
the
document
and
hell
also
look
into
investigations
on
discrepancy
cases
increased
efforts
on
remains
implementing
trilateral
investigations
and
access
to
military
archives
and
ambassador
toon
also
briefed
the
president
on
the
activities
of
the
joint
commission
and
on
the
document
q
vietnam
says
its
a
fake
what
is
the
dod
analysis
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
its
not
completed
yet
and
its
also
the
first
thing
that
general
vessey
will
bring
up
with
the
vietnamese
q
a
number
of
defense
officials
have
been
saying
that
they
think
that
the
or
so
prisoners
referred
to
are
in
fact
nonamericans
that
the
vietnamese
had
captured
who
they
referred
to
as
americans
from
time
to
time
do
people
mr
stephanopoulos
we
dont
have
any
final
determination
were
going
to
wait
for
the
complete
review
when
we
have
it
well
make
a
judgment
q
i
know
you
dont
have
any
final
determination
but
given
all
of
the
intense
public
interest
in
this
do
you
think
that
thats
a
likely
possibility
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
want
to
characterize
it
in
any
way
until
the
review
is
complete
q
george
was
there
a
topic
scheduled
for
the
speech
in
boston
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
is
the
president
going
to
have
a
press
conference
tomorrow
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
but
im
not
positive
yes
i
expect
yes
q
was
toon
in
with
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
he
was
in
on
the
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
what
was
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
was
ambassador
toon
in
with
vessey
and
the
answer
is
yes
q
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
wall
street
journal
report
this
morning
the
presidents
distressed
about
some
of
his
press
clippings
and
that
perhaps
hes
distressed
with
you
about
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
well
i
do
have
a
response
i
think
the
article
was
highly
misleading
to
the
extent
that
it
implied
that
the
president
has
had
restricted
access
to
the
press
i
would
point
out
that
hes
answered
questions
on
occasions
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
i
would
also
point
out
it
also
q
how
many
questions
mr
stephanopoulos
three
hundred
fiftyeight
on
occasions
q
how
many
were
while
he
was
jogging
mr
stephanopoulos
well
no
thats
actually
a
very
good
question
andrea
and
i
would
point
out
further
that
the
article
also
implied
that
these
questions
were
only
answered
at
tightly
controlled
photo
opportunities
which
is
just
patently
false
hes
had
press
conferences
in
either
the
east
room
the
oval
office
or
the
roosevelt
room
or
the
briefing
room
in
addition
to
questions
taken
at
photo
opportunities
and
that
is
only
the
q
oval
office
press
conference
when
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
answered
questions
in
the
east
room
hes
had
five
in
the
east
room
hes
had
one
in
the
oval
office
hes
had
one
in
the
rose
garden
hes
had
one
or
two
in
the
roosevelt
room
and
this
is
just
to
the
white
house
washington
press
corps
in
addition
to
that
hes
had
interviews
with
local
television
anchors
hes
met
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
portland
oregonian
hes
had
an
hourlong
interview
with
dan
rather
hes
had
interviews
with
local
press
from
california
florida
and
connecticut
q
can
you
address
the
question
of
the
attitude
the
article
implies
that
he
doesnt
q
why
doesnt
he
like
us
laughter
q
did
you
really
get
blamed
for
that
post
story
q
the
story
is
that
you
are
you
held
responsible
for
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
im
going
to
comment
about
this
q
are
you
denying
that
the
president
has
shown
displeasure
publicly
mr
stephanopoulos
i
am
not
commenting
on
the
discussions
between
the
president
and
myself
q
did
the
president
write
that
letter
to
chris
webber
mr
stephanopoulos
what
q
the
letter
to
the
university
of
michigan
basketball
player
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
yes
q
that
is
an
authentic
letter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
since
the
president
first
talked
about
the
vat
in
february
he
said
at
the
time
that
he
thought
there
probably
should
be
exceptions
made
in
basic
necessities
such
as
food
and
clothing
does
he
still
hold
that
position
given
the
impact
it
could
have
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
just
cant
comment
on
a
proposal
he
hasnt
made
q
george
does
the
president
have
some
agenda
for
this
meeting
with
the
gay
leaders
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
it
will
just
a
general
meeting
on
the
wide
range
of
issues
that
they
care
about
including
aids
and
other
issues
civil
rights
q
the
military
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
it
will
come
up
q
is
he
using
this
event
to
name
the
aids
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
q
george
what
specifically
is
the
president
doing
to
prepare
for
tomorrows
meeting
with
the
prime
minister
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
had
briefing
memos
hes
had
general
discussions
with
members
of
the
treasury
department
the
trade
representative
and
others
q
report
yet
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
he
has
the
report
referred
to
in
the
times
but
ambassador
kantor
was
here
to
brief
him
today
q
he
was
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
does
he
intend
to
use
any
of
these
instances
that
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
that
the
reports
been
presented
but
obviously
the
president
will
press
hard
in
any
case
where
he
thinks
that
a
violation
has
occurred
q
in
terms
of
the
wall
street
journal
the
thrust
was
that
theres
a
real
schism
here
a
hostility
do
you
think
he
feels
that
way
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
as
i
said
on
the
record
in
the
article
i
think
the
president
likes
reporters
again
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
still
misleading
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
that
in
some
way
some
attitude
which
the
president
may
or
may
not
have
is
affecting
access
when
in
fact
he
has
the
most
open
accessible
administration
than
have
any
in
recent
history
q
can
we
come
up
to
your
office
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
if
youre
invited
the
press
thank
you

up
at

by
mike

p
drug
use
is
on
the
rise
among
kids
as
young
as
eighth
graders
usually
and
theyre
using
more
lsd
and
inhalants
like
glue
and
air
fresheners
says
a
new
survey
the
annual
national
high
school
senior
survey
on
drug
abuse
finds
statistically
significant
increases
in
eighthgraders
use
of
many
drugs
including
marijuana
cocaine
crack
lsd
and
inhalants
we
may
be
in
danger
of
losing
some
hardwon
ground
in
reducing
drug
use
as
a
new
more
naive
generation
of

enters

says

is
continuing

up

among

is
at
its
highest
point
since
tried
it
in
the
last
year
reducing
drug
use
among
students
requires
a
different
kind
of
strategy
that
health
secretary
donna
shalala
says
will
be
part
of
an
overall
illness
prevention
plan
the
survey
shows
drugs
are
easier
to
get
and
fewer
eighthgraders
disapprove
of
them
its
scary

that

showing
you

real
status

my

ive
also
posted
two

from

that
clearly
demonstrate
that

use
among
certain
age

is
on
the
rise
if
wod
is
working
as
were

to
believe
then

should

it

not

very
much

im
also
going

source
university
of
michigan
institute
for
social
research
report
we
are
not
winning
the
war
on
drugs
i
think
you
can
see
that
one
of
the
tactics
that
the
dea
employs
to
give
people
the
impression
that
the
war
on
drugs
is
being
won
is
to
selectively
quote
statistics
only
statistics
that
support
their
contention
that
drug
use
has
gone
down
the
excerpt
from
time
magazine
that
i
included
in
this
post
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
organizations
like
the
dea
attempt
to
deceive
the
public
usage
of
one
particular
drug
may
have
gone
down
but
at
the
same
time
usage
of
other
drugs
may
have
gone
up
aka
substitution
also
drug
usage
among
one
particular
age
group
may
have
gone
down
but
drug
usage
among
another
age
group
may
have
gone
up
therefore
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
big
picture
taking
into
consideration
all
the
statistics
then
its
obvious
that
the
socalled
war
on
drugs
is
being
lost
perhaps
the
drug
war
is
being
won
as
far
as
illegal
drugs
go
but
if
one
factors
in
alcohol
abuse
smoking
and
use
of
inhalants
then
the
magnitude
of
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
can
then
placed
in
its
true
perspective
for
those
of
you
who
dont
consider
alcohol
to
be
a
drug
then
try
drinking
a
fifth
of
whiskey
sometime
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
that
its
not
a
drug
agencies
like
the
dea
only
go
after
illegal
drugs
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
drug
war
is
a
fruitless
attempt
at
preventing
substance
abusepeople
will
merely
switch
to
another
drug
if
the
one
they
were
using
becomes
scarce
or
unpopular
the
solution
to
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
this
country
may
be
to
legalize
somenot
alldrugs
whose
toxicity
has
been
shown
to
be
within
reasonable
limits
you
wont
drop
dead
after
using
it
a
few
times
and
then
couple
this
with
a
massive
drug
education
program
the
reason
why
i
think
legalization
is
part
of
the
solution
is
because
people
seem
to
be
able
to
easily
obtain
drugs
despite
the
governments
efforts
to
the
contrarythe
money
spent
on
drug
interdiction
could
be
spent
more
effectively
elsewhere
eg
drug
education
additionally
legalization
would
reduce
crime
because
the
profit
motive
would
be
taken
out
of
drug
trafficking
which
often
goes
along
with
other
kinds
of
crime
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
addicts
would
have
less
reason
to
prey
on
innocent
people
for
their
money
and
posessions
in
order
to
support
their
expensive
habit
legalization
would
cause
the
street
price
of
drugs
to
fall
substantially
so
drugs
would
be
much
more
affordable
to
addicts
imho
the
way
to
reduce
substance
abuse
is
to
do
to
drugs
what
has
been
done
to
smokers
make
drug
use
socially
unacceptable
rather
than
try
to
employ
heavyhanded
law
enforcement
and
punish
people
by
incarcerating
them
as
you
already
know
people
in
the
us
smoke
a
lot
less
than
they
used
to
this
reduction
in
the
number
of
smokers
has
been
brought
about
by
public
awareness
campaigns
laws
restricting
where
people
can
light
up
warning
labels
on
cigarette
packages
taxation
on
tobacco
in
order
to
reduce
consumption
and
so
on
i
propose
that
similar
methods
be
used
to
reduce
substance
abuse
after
legalization
has
been
carried
out
they
are
as
follows
drugs
being
sold
must
come
with
clear
concise
information
which
states
the
possible
health
hazzards
involved
with
using
this
product
and
recommendations
on
how
the
drug
should
be
used
things
like
dosage
levels
and
how
long
the
drug
should
be
used
ought
to
accompany
the
packaging
the
drug
is
contained
in
all
drugs
should
be
taxed
at
a
rate
that
generates
a
lot
of
revenue
but
not
so
high
as
to
encourage
people
to
acquire
drugs
through
illegal
channels
part
of
the
revenue
collected
from
drug
taxes
should
be
used
to
fund
drug
education
and
law
enforcement
make
it
a
felony
to
sell
drugs
to
minors
people
under
the
age
of
anyone
can
sell
drugs
but
they
must
not
dodge
paying
the
taxes
on
drugs
or
sell
drugs
with
the
warning
information
absent
failure
to
pay
the
appropiate
taxes
on
drugs
or
omitting
warning
information
should
also
be
a
felony
establish
a
government
agency
whose
job
is
to
insure
that
the
purity
and
safety
of
all
drugs
is
as
high
as
possible
this
agency
would
try
to
prevent
people
from
getting
a
hold
of
bad
drugssomething
that
is
a
fairly
serious
problem
now
im
sure
that
many
of
the
things
ive
discussed
in
this
article
have
been
hashed
out
before
in
this
newsgroup
nevertheless
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
give
my
two
cents
actually
a
buck
and
a
half
all
at

so
you
could
get
a
good
idea
of
where

currently
stand
on

go
ahead
and
tear
into
my

im
sure
there
is
something
in
it
that
you
may
wish
to
take
a
different
view
on
or
flame
btw
i
posted
the

to

also

drug

each

johnston
says
this
type
of
resurgence
is
possible
says
eileen

delta
but
thats
not
the
issue
she
says
the
prevalence
of
alcohol
and
drugs
among
teens
today
could
result
in
more
alcoholic
adults
decades
from
now
aggravating
the
problem
baby
boomer
parents
who
experimented
with
drugs
and
alcohol
as
teens
trying
to
be
friends
not
parents
to
their
children
ive
even
seen
parents
serving
kegs
of
beer
to
their
underage
kids
and
friends
shiff
says
for
a
recent
graduation
shiff
and
other
parents
organized
an
allnight
lockin
party
where
no
booze
or
drugs
were
allowed
we
need
to
fulfill
that
parental
role
otherwise
the
peer
group
takes
over
she
says
officials
may
talk
about
the
war
on

they
really
havent
done
anything

a

educationwise
she
says

some
dont
want
to
give

the
facts
they
think
it
will
give
them
ideas
its
the

with

control
i
think
you
should
give

the
information
or
have
it

it
smacks
real

a

is
fine
since
that

would
proceed
regardless

think
a
bad

has
already
been

in

something

this

make

worse
regardless
of
how
bad
anybody
feels

this
decision
it
must

limiting

the

is
insuring

not

if
the

any
reasonable
way

marxism

a

x
i
think
to

anyone

dealers
license
to
own
at

cars
at
a

me
continue

try

answer
steves
questions
steve
lets
say
you
have
the
talent
and
inclination
to
fix
up
and
resell
cars
either
youve
gotten
good
enough
at
it
in
your
spare
time
to
bump
up
against
these
limits
or
you
would
like
to
do
it
fulltime
but
these
stupid
arbitrary
laws
prevent
you
from
starting
out
small
and
pulling
yourself
up
so
im
protected
from
a
hungry
neighborhood
competitor
willing
to
take
a
low
profit
while
working
extra
hard
to
fulfill
my
needs
and
youre
protected
from
doing
what
you
want
with
your
life
heres
what
i
see
libertarianism
offering
you
your
money
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
if
you
use
it
to
buy
a
car
it
is
truly
your
car
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
your
money
to
fix
up
that
car
since
it
is
your
car
you
can
sell
that
car
your
life
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
it
matters
not
if
someone
thinks
that
its
wrong
for
you
to
buy
and
sell
cars
within
months
rather
than
say
cars
they
may
dissaprove
but
it
is
not
their
life
or
their
money
it
is
your
life
and
your
money
my
money
is
truly
mine
it
belongs
to
me
i
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
perhaps
your
car
perhaps
that
car
the
one
that
someone
somewhere
dissaproves
of
you
selling
and
presumably
of
me
buying
that
someone
could
go
to
the
government
and
insist
that
the
government
make
us
stop
it
but
the
government
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
doing
what
we
like
with
our
own
property
in
the
abscence
of
fraud
or
agression
and
it
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
associating
with
each
other
this
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
utopian
dream
but
basic
human
decency
and
common
sense
a
real
grassroots
example
of
freedom
and
liberty
and
yes
not
having
a
few
people
acting
as
our
masters
approving
or
rejecting
each
of
our
basic
transactions
with
each
other
does
strike
me
as
a
wonderful
way
to
improve
the
human

so
what
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
back
your
statments
with

or
shut

it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
again
back
your
statements
or
shut
up
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
not
surprising
remember
that
study
includes
homosexuals
as
well
hmm
tell
me
did
you
go
to
the
mickey
mouse
school
of
logic
you
have
just
stated
that
there
are
not
many
homosexuals
as
kinsey
reported
in
his
survey
and
the
surveys
of
the
kinsey
institute
since
then
you
say
that
the
reason
many
young
people
are
promiscuous
is
because
homosexuals
form
a
large
part
of
that
group
or
there
are
some
homosexuals
whose
lives
consist
of
having
sex
with
no
gaps
for
eating
c
using
your
logic
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
on
average
gay
men
have
about
partners
each
a
week
try
to
think
through
your
arguments
carefully
or
then
again
not
because
i
like
to
laugh
every
now
and
then
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
and
what
did
this
study
show
for
number
of
sexual
contacts
for
those
who
said
they
where
homosexual
or
is
that
number
to
inconvient
for
you
it
wasnt
published
hence
the
argument
cannot
be
resolved
using
this
data
next
point
please
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
fuck
off
typical
homoseuxal
response
this
depends
on
the
premise
that
there
are
only
three
types
of
behaviour
gay
bi
and
hetero
this
has
yet
to
be
proved
see
an
earlier
post
about
the
kinsey
institute
of
grading
this
although
rough
seems
more
logical
also
you
use
this
would
show
defining
a
fact
and
not
an
assumption

your

this

wanted

right

if
the

hadnt

him
the

he
wanted
nothing

secondly
the

were
expecting
everything
the

did
they
thought
that
they
were
facing
the
apocalypse
and
that
they
were
to

they

they
are

they

look

david

has
been
arrested
twice
by
local
police
both
times
he
accepted
the
arrest
warrant
and
went
peacefully
so
the
feds
decide
to
arrest
him
how
do
they
choose
to
arrest
a
person
with
a
record
of
peaceful
obedience
under
arrest
they
throw
a
concussion
grenades
at
his
building
in
addition
we
know
that
weve
been
lied
to
initially
we
were
told
that
they
suspected
him
of
molesting
children
and
having
several
wives
but
these
are
not
atf
offenses
were
they
so
they
changed
their
story
several
times
and
the
original
warrant
is
still
sealed
and
we
were
told
about
the
rockets
and
ammunition
they
had
but
did
anyone
notice
any
ammo
exploding
in
the
fire
they
claimed
that
koresh
hadnt
left
the
compound
in
months
but
people
in
town
report
seeing
him
just
a
week
before
the
raid
how
would
i
have
handled
it
differently
well
first
i
havent
seen
any
evidence
that
the
bds
did
anything
wrong
theres
a
sealed
warrant
and
a
collection
of
stories
which
keep
changing
about
what
they
did
so
i
might
not
have
done
anything
ok
now
supposing
that
i
know
what
the
bds
are
being
arrested
for
well
theyve
got
a
history
of
accepting
arrests
so
i
send
officers
to
the
door
with
a

wearing
bulletproof
vests
covered

now
theres
no

will
do
anything

didnt
anyone
try
serving

ok
going

they
refuse
the

it

to

you
plan
a

you

you

change

nope
they

anyone

it

i
dont

the

the

ted
i
dont

mr

racial

but
had
mr
king
been
white
there
would
not
have
been
a

you
probably
are
saying
that
the

would
not

occurred
if
he
were
white
but
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
call
to
make
it
is
possible
the
case
but
not
definately
one
could
easily
point
out
that
the
jury
decided
that
this
extremely

call
could
be
made
which
is
why
the
two
of
the
defendants
were
found
guilty
one
could
also
make
some
interesting
observations
on
our
system
of
justice
where
the
men
were
not
guilty
of
excessive
force
but
guilty
enough
to
have
violated
his
civil

by
use
of
the
nonexistant
excessive
force
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
powell

guilty
of
aiding

so
what
can
we
deduce
from
these
figures
are
there
a
lot
less
male
homosexuals
than
there
used
to
be
or
are
men
perhaps
women
too
not
as
honest
as
they
used
to
be
about
there
sexuality
presumably
the
people
that
were
polled
in
you
mean
in
the
men
and
women
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexuality
than
today
want
to
try
that
one
again
that
probably
is
not
true
but
today
it
may
not
be
much
better
for
the

population
in
general
you
mean
ignore
study
after
study
so
that
we
can
continue
to
accept
a
study
kinseys
that
is
obviously
wrong
where
are
all
of
these
studies
you
have
cited
a
few
and
my
research
shows
that
there
are
not
that
many
do
not
confuse
a
survey
as
a
study
there
is
a
big
difference
asking
people
outside
of
a
polling
booth
and
adding
up
numbers
is
not
a
study
as
easily
of
been
gay
i
suppose
one
of
the
big
debates
about
homosexuality
is
whether
or
not
its
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learned
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
its
some
combination
of
the
two
based
on
what
besides
your
own
warm
fuzzy
feelings
but
this
is
what
you
base
most
of
your
conclusion
upon
warm
fuzzy
feelings
maybe
he
has
stated
an
educated
opinion
based
upon
the
studies
that
involve
genetics
and
psychological
influence
there
are
a
lot
of
those
types
of
studies
arent
there
try
reading
some
heres
something
to
ponder
upon
have
any
of
you
gaybashers
out
there
ever
considered
that
homosexuals
probably
deem
their
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
just
as
much
an
intrinsic
and
natural
part
of
their
life
as
heterosexuals
do
about
their
own
sexuality
in
other
words
someone
who
is
truly
alcoholics
share
that
feeling
until
they
hit
bottom
this
is
a
crap
statement
and
comparison
many
people
use
this
sad
and
stupid
argument
there
is
not
relationship
between
alcoholics
and
peoples
sexual
orientation
except
that
some
may
find
what
it
really
is
when
they
are
drunk
repressed
inhibition
released
unless
of
course
the
problem
is
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
mental
disorder
caused
by
childhood
sexual
abuse
as
a
number
of
recent
works
suggest
nonsense
this
simply
is
not
true
i
suppose
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
try
and
tell
you
to
understand
what
a
study
presents
most
of
what
you
cite
does
not
extrapolate
anything
you
do
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on
others
antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
if
people
in
general
would
stop
using
irrational
position
to
oppress
others
and
leave
our
private
lives
to
ourselves
i
would
have
no
support
for
laws
and
rules
to
protect
people
form
this
but
we
need
only
look
at
post
such
as
yours
to
see
that
they
lack
rational
thought
and
intelligent
outlooks
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness
remember
that

hopped

never

the

procedure
is
to
accept
some
part

arguement
and
run
with
it
until
one
goes
beyond
rational
thought
and
then
ring
the
changes
zb
the
idea
of
a
minimum
wage
is
considered
a
good
one
and
in
these
times
of
economic
difficulty
the
washington
legislature
is
propossing
to
raise
the
state
minwage
from
the
federal
level
to
fifteen
cents
over
oregons
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
increase
does
not
keep
pace
with
inflation
that
the
minimum
wage
should
be
to
by
my
figures
so
it
is
proposed
that
we
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
per
hour
by
july
and
then
give
a
cost
of
living
increase
every
july
and
anyone
who
doesnt
like
it
is
obviously
a
country

republican
getting
rich

and
shooting
in

shortly
there
after

only

it

no

that
claim
there
were
adults
an
children
in

funny
how
the
fire
seemed
to
start
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
building
just
next
to
where
a
tank
was
backing
away
though
probably
just
a
coincidence
watch
the
videotape
carefully
the
cnn
coverage
was
fairly
decisive
the
first
fire
starts
in
the
tower
this
is
three
storeys
high
and
there
is
a
flag
to
the
right
of
it
on
the
picture
the
second
fire
starts
in
another
tower
which
is
similar
to
the
first
only
two
storeys
high
the
flag
is
on
the
left
in
the
camera
picture
that
shows
this
fire

thus
the

cleraly
show
the
fire
starting
at
two
separate
locations
the
fbi
report
a
third
i
was
not
able
to
verify
it
from
the

however
someone
else
identified
a
fire
shown
to
be
starting
behind
the
small
tower
in
the
second
flag
on
left
camera
angle
the
flames
coming
out
of
the
building
are
yelloworange
this
is
the
normal
colour
for
carbon
compounds
burning
the
flames
were
those
of
a
solid
or
confined
liquid
burning
not
of
a
gas
exploding
the
explosion
that
occurs
mid
way
along
the
building
is
certainly
not
an
explosive
though
the
cloud
itself
is
on
fire
this
would
seem
to
be
most
likely
to
be
some
sort
of
fuel
oil
store
exploding
rather
than
the
explosion

funny
how

there
was
to
be
a
great
cache
of
explosives
ammunition
etc
in
the
compound
i
did
not
see
any
series
of
explosions
depends
entirely
on
how
they
were
distributed
you
would
not
be
able
to
identify
ammunition
rounds
going
off
from
video
camera
coverage
from
a
mile
away
if
and
when
the
fbi
release
pictures
from
cmeras

the
armoured
vehicles
which
presumably
exist
it
might
be
possible
to
get
a
clearer
picture
if
anyone
expects
to
see
explosions
hollywood
style

then
remember
that
in
real
life
cars
do
not
burst
into
flames
when
going
over
cliffs
just
about
the
most
you
could
expect
would
be
to
see
the
grenades
going
off
since
the
building
was
designed
to
be

proof
to
some
extent
it
would
be

to
distinguish
the
grenades
going
off
from
the
collapse

people
have
that

better
than
what
the
fbi
had
been
doing
for
the
last
few
months
firstly
they
could
have
backed
off
when
you
put
a
power
freak
like
david
koresh
in
that
kind
of
situation
he
is
going
to
explode
no
pun
intended
koresh
wanted
to
be
a
martyr
and
the
government
played
right
into
his
hands
if
the
government
hadnt
given
him
the
attention
he
wanted
nothing
would
have
ever
happened
secondly
the
davidians
were
expecting
everything
the
government
did
they
thought
that
they
were
facing
the
apocalypse
and
that
they
were
to
perish
in
fire
they
werent
scared
of
the
fbi
they
are
not
the
average
hoods
they
are
very
devout
followers
of
a
religion
psyops
didnt
work
and
the
government
got
frustrated
so
they
murdered
them
the
batf
should
have
left
at
the
beginning
they
should
have
looked
at
koreshs
personality
instead
they
thought
they
have
guns
we
have
bigger
guns
lets
go
get
em
they
botched
it
from
day
one
they
shouldnt
have
been
there
in
the
first
place
the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked

the
above
statement
ignores
reality
the
bd
were
provoked
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
damn
phil
you
must
have
seen
a
different
tape
of
the
initial
raid
than
i
did
your
doorbell
happened
to
include
lobbing
percussion
grenades
and
attempting
to
storm
the
compound
through
the
windows
i
can
honestly
say
i
have
never
seen
a
doorbell
that
works
like
that
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the

fired
first
in
an
unprovoked

assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a

authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
think
man
the
batf
are
serving
a
warrant
on
someone
who
they
feel
might
have
illegal
automatic
weapons
if
they
expected
as
you
state
that
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peaceful
citizens
they
could
have
sent
one
maybe
two
agents
up
to
the
front
door
knock
and
attempt
to
serve
the

on
the
person
answering
the

scenario
one
that
person
lets
them
in
to
perform
the
search
and
no
one
gets
hurt
scenario
two
the
person
answering
the
door
pulls
a
weapon
aand
kills
both
officers
now
you
have
two
dead
batf
agents
instead
of
four
the
batf
knows
exactly
where
they
stand
with
regards
to
the
bd
and
began
to
formulate
a
plan
of
action
to
arrest
those
responsible
without
harm
to
the
innocent
peoplechildren
within
the
compound
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a
warant
on
the

by
ludicrously
underarmed
and
unprotected
police
no
the

was
the

anyone
on

perhaps
we
could
hear
it
sure
do
it

the

to
uphold
the

not

so
we

the

either
wont

theres
one
that
seems
better

any
other
ive
ever

suggested
voluntary

mandatory
bad
that
is
a
third
party
should
involve
itself
in
a
transaction
only
at
the
request
of
the
primary
participants
so
we
dont
formulate
a
rule
that
will
always
tell
we
try
to
use
knowledge
about
other
properties
of
situations
to
some
of
us
it
appears
that
trying
always
to
apply
voluntary
good
mandatory
bad
is
not
only
less
than
optimal
it
is
in
some
circumstances
seriously
damaging
the
interesting
question
is
to
characterize
those
circumstances
as
best
we
can
look
somebody
has
to
have
the
power
to
decide
whether
a
third

will
regulate
your
transactions
or
not
that
somebody
is
going
to
be
either
you
or
the
third

you
can
argue
until
you
are
blue
in
the
face
that
regulators
shouldnt
get
involved
in
fact
people
have
tried
this
they

the
fundamental

you
have

whose

it

you
can

thinking

when
mcmanus
says

i
can
hardly
believe
hes
referring
to
a
system
that
costs
us
percent
of
our
gdp
while
there
isnt
a
single
other
country
in
the
industrialized
world
that
spends
more
than
percent
that
leaves
million
of
us
with
no
coverage
even
though
all
the
other
systems
in
the
industrialized
world
cover
virtually
everyone
yet
americans
rank
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
in
terms
of
life
expectancy
childhood
immunization
rate
infant
mortality
and
many
preventable
diseases
we
pay
on

about
each
for
mris
to
put
that
in

they
cost
in
japan
the
average

company
spends

a

per
employee
on
health

seven
hundred
to
is
the
range
just
about
everywhere
else
how
can
anyone
say
that
such
a
system
is
the
best
in
the
world
the
only
thing
the
usa
health
care
system
is
good
at
is
showering
wellinsured
patients
with
a
champagne
treatment
of
care
and
outrageously
overcharging
for
it
and
the
private
system
of
insurers
and
paperwork
is
so
bloated
and
inefficient
that
it
itself
sucks
up
over
billion
dollars
a
year
in
money
from
every
other
sector
of
society
individuals
government
and
industry
of
the
billion
dollars
americans
threw
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
health
care
costs
last
year
the
consumers
union
estimated
that
at
least
billion
was
thrown
away
on
overpriced
useless
and
even
downright
harmful
tests
and
procedures
and
the
most
bureaucratic
regulated
insurance
system
in
the
world
there
are
more
than
different
private
insurers
in
the
usa
but
did
the
private
competition
stimulate
more
efficient
paperwork
ask
any
doctor
whos
had
to
hire
a
fulltime
clerk
to
deal
with
it
all
the
competition
among
hospitals
is
driving
costs
up
not
down
the
competition
among
hospitals
for
both
doctors
and
patients
has
encouraged
the
hospitals
to
traffic
in
expensive
superfluous
equipment
spending
millions
on
expensive
machines
of
dubious
value
that
spend
percent
of
the
day
idle
isnt
my
idea
of
the
worlds
best
health
care
system
competition
among
specialists
is
driving
them
to
perform
dangerous
and
expensive
procedures
where
they
are
very
marginally
helpful
im
especially
thinking
of
heart
surgery
and
some
womens
surgeries
like
hysterectomy
and
cesarean
section
sound
like
the
worlds
best
health
care
system
ever
notice
how
every
time
someone
tries
to
bring
about
some
real
change
in
health
care
the
libbies
start
bashing
canadas
system
first
of
all
hillary
clinton
is
not
advocating
another
canadian
system
i
think
thats
been
made
abundantly
clear
in
the
news
for
the
last
couple
of
months
where
did
john
f
mcmanus
get
that
idea
anyway
lets
say
youre
a
canadian
living
in
a
small
town
near
the
usa
border
your
child
needs
a
complicated
procedure
only
available
in
city
hospitals
the
nearest
canadian
cities
are
hours
west
and
hours
east
and
theres
an
american
city
one
hour
south
which
way
are
you
going
to
go
is
it
because
the
american
system
is
the
best
in
the
world
or
just
for
convenience
it
still
amazes
me
that
people
cant
seem
to
see
more
than
just
black
and
white
on
health
care
reform
there
are
a
million
different
ways
we
ould
restructure
the
system
its
not
just
a
choice
between
total
government
control
and
total
private
control
i
wish
the
people
screaming
socialized
medicine
every
time
soemone
wants
to
change
the
current
syste
would
inform
themselves
on
health
care
issues
the
current
system
sucks
i
want
to
keep
providers
private
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
we
will
never
be
able
to
deal
with
the
deficit
if
we
dont
reform
the
health
care
system
purely
private
health
care
without
any
government
intervention
doesnt
work
hillary
clinton
is
not
thinking
of
nationalizing
providers
or
evern
insurers
how
can
you
scream
socialized
medicine
at
her
programs
dont
you
even
know
what
youre
talking
about
ever
see
clintons
graphs
of
projected
deficit
versus
year
for
the
rest
of
the
decade
notice
how
the
line
falls
then
starts
increasing
why
ill
give
you
one
wild
guess
as
to
which
component
of
spending
will
overwhelm
us
if
we
dont
do
something
about
it
peope
just
doesnt
get
it
the
current
health
care
system
is
a
cancer
which
is
killing
our
economic
wellbeing
costs
are
still
rising
percent
a
year
even
as
americans
by
the
tens
of
millions
go
without
or
are
forced
into
managedcare
programs
which
are
certainly
pretty
socialized
already
if
you
ask
me
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
posted
a
message
asking
any
hillarybashers
to
please
come
forward
and
present
no
gimmicks
straight
talk
just
how
they
would
set
about
keeping
costs
down
i
didnt
get
a
single
answer
the
only
thing
i
keep
hearing
from
libbie
organizations
are
press
releases
filled
with
evasive
platitudes
like
give
health
care
back
to
the
people
just
do
you
expect
to
do
that
without
serious
reforms
what
is
it
about
the
current
system
that
you
would
change
and
how
would
that
help
how
can
anyone
read
the
news
live
under
our
system
and
not
see
these
faults
how
can
we
deal
with
the
deficit
our
cities
our
educational
system
our
infrastrucure
aids
modernizing
our
industry
etc
if
we
dont
quit
throwing
away
money
which
could
be
used
to
solve
those
problems
america
needs
health

reform

that
the

started

simply
does
not

up
if
the
aft
had

there
to
start

they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic

the
people
who
do
not

control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to

legislation
through
i
must
object
to
the
characterization
of
those
opposed
to
the
governments
handling
of
the
waco
situation
as
gun
supporters
your
argument
tries
to
paint
the
batf
critics
as
rightwing
gun
nuts
and
just
mixes
up
two
issues
i
am
one
of
the
batffbi
critics
and
yet
i
am
a
liberal
and
just
as
antigun
as
you
are
i
just
happen
to
believe
that
everyone
has
civil
rights
even
religious
crazies
theyre
all
human
beings
not
some
nest
of
wasps
that
youre
trying
to
exterminate
the
batf
created
the
crisis
situation
by
the
way
they
handled
the
original
raid
it
was
well
known
that
koresh
regularly
went
jogging
outside
his
property
he
could
have
been
served
with
a
search
warrant
then
he
could
have
been
arrested
if
he
had
refused
to
comply
instead
officers
armed
with
grenades
invaded
the
property
this
escalated
into
a
shooting
war
with
tragic
deaths
on
both
sides
those
were
the
first
two
mistakes
the
bad
judgment
of
asking
for
a
noknock
warrant
and
the
bad
and
probably
illegal
way
the
alreadyunwise
warrant
was
served
at
this
point
the
situation
escalated
to
where
it
was
described
as
an
armed
standoff
and
a
hostage
crisis
thats
when
the
government
started
covering
their
traces
sealing
the
warrant
revising
their
reported
history
of
the
incident
etc
things
were
already
building
up
to
disaster
now
the
government
could
have
simply
closed
the
supply
routes
and
waited
but
according
to
janet
reno
that
option
had
never
been
seriously
considered
so
supposedly
because
the
agents
were
frustrated
and
fatigued
and
because
there
supposedly
were
no
backups
they
felt
they
had
to
go
in
now
its
entirely
possible
that
koresh
was
responsible
for
the
fire
if
thats
so
he
deserves
the
blame
for
the
deaths
of
the
people
in
his
compound
but
the
governments
hands
are
far
from
clean
their
first
raid
demonstrated
bad
judgment
plus
contempt
for
the
amendment
the
motivations
for
the
second
raid
are
just
too
unbelievable
and
their
coverup
of
the
events
of
the
first
raid
undermines
their
credibility
in
anything
they
do
thereafter
we
have
only
some
very
biased
fbi
agents
word
for
what
happened
and
please
lets
not
turn
this
into
a
progun

not

basically
i
think
this
tendency
for
non
african
americans
to
believe
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
exists
because
non

americans
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
possiblility
that
the
society
is
deeply
biased
against
african
americans
and
that
this
is
about
of
the
problem
there
is
something
terribly
wrong

with
a

which
condemns

and
she
tells
me
that
she
and
her

are
frustrated
to

by
the
fact
that
any
african

child
who
attempts
to
do
well
in

get
an
education
is
accused
by
hisher

of
trying

it

suggest
mr

when

this

you

none
of

this
no

this
is
your

which
is
not
backed
up
by
any

any
knowledge
according
to
one
survey
done
in

the
number
of
heterosexual

who
were

children
was
on
the
order
of
the

was
on

a

sorry
the

escapes
me
conclusions
that
can

none
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on

antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness
oh
you
definitely
have
a
choice
you
realize
of

that
you
are

how

two

incidentally
we

you

what
exactly
are
you
trying

say
and
why
were
there
no
fireengines
within
a
mile
of
the
compound
because
the
gun
loonies
were
firing
on
vehicles
with
amunition
that
has
a
range
of
meters
next
question
the
problem
is
of
course
the
laws
that
allow
a
bunch
of
raving
nutters
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arms
in
the
first
place
the
sequence
of
events
meant
that
there
really
was
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervention
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mounted
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempted
to
save
the
children
by
shooting
all
the
adults
it
really
was
a
no
win
situation
koresh
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
officers
instead
he
ordered
the
murder
of
the
children
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessary
to
beleive
the
words
of
a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the
suicidemurder
of
his
other
followers
according
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempted
to
serve
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
the
bd
seige
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
indefinitely
the
bd
were
quite
capable
of
commiting
mass
suicide
and
murdering
the
children
at
any
time
a
commando
assault
was
the
only
other
likely
action
that
could
have
achieved
that
objective
that
would
have
been
very
risky
orders
of
magintude
harder
than
antebbe
or
the
iranian
embassy

are
not

ranch
apocalypse
was
terrorists
are
far
easier
to
disloge
without
casualties
than
allowing
the
siege
to
go
on
was
not
an
option
either
besides
the
serious
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
any
moment
there
was
the
question
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
the
emmergency
team
on
standby
over
a
prolonged
period
the
longer
the
siege
went
on
the
more
mentally
prepared
koresh
and
his
followers
would
be
for
a
prolonged
siege
rather
than
go
in
prematurely
the
mistake
was
probably
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
getting
the
children
out
a
certain
way
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legislation
through
this
conspiracy
theory
assumes
that
the
batf
deliberately
got
of
its
agents
killed
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actually
enjoy
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
texas
being
shot
at
by
religious
nutters
still
the
conspiracy
theory
is
comforting
it
allows
them
to
pretend
that
waco
proves
nothing
except
about
how
incompetent
the
government
is
in
resolving
a
hostage
crisis
no
govt
in
the
world
has
ever
faced
a
comparable
situation
quite
probably
there
was
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peacefully
resolved
the
blame
does
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
koresh
was
allowed
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tipped
the
bd
off
in
advance
has
the
murder
of
atf
agents
and
children
on
his
or
her
conscience
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
us
who
predict
the
end
of
society
preach
salvation
through
armed
security
the
fact
is
that
these
are
the
very
people
who
pose
the
threat
to
society
in
the
first
place
the
next
waco
may
not
be
religious
nutters
but
a
political
movement
a
splinter
group
of
the
klu
klux
klan
taking
over
a
schoolhouse
in
a
black
area
for
example
and
holding
several
hundred
children
hostage
the
only
possible
solution
to
such
situations
that
can
work
is
to
prevent
them
arising
no
other
government
in
the
world
has
faced
such
a
situation
this
is
because
no
other
government
has
so
carelessly
allowed
high
power
weaponry
to
become
avaliable
to
any
little
hitler
or
would
be

please
come
forward

present
no
gimmicks
straight
talk
just
how
they
would

about
keeping

down
i
didnt

the
first
thing
i
would
do
would
be
to
disband
medicare

medicade
they
are
a
primary
reason
why
health

costs
are
going
up
to
cover
the
people
that
are
currently
on

i
would
sell
their
coverage
in
blocks
to
insurance
companies
the
private
companies
would
bid
to
get
these
large
blocks
of
people
and
prices
would
go
down
to
get
away
from
strong
federal
control
on
health

i
would
pass
off
more
control
to
the

everyone
is
always
spewing
forth
about
how
wonderful
hawaii
is
doing
well
how
about
giving
some
other
states
incentive
to
try

what
i
would
not
do
is
try
to
implement
some
far
reaching
federal

program
to
cover
all
americans
because
this
is
the

way
to

how
can
anyone

how

one
sure
way
to
stop

is
to
stop

absolutely

it

to

that
a
possible

of

you

our

is
exactly
the

as
in

us
if
not
more
powerful
now
that
they
can
dictate

payment
rates
but
i
dont
know
an
answer
to
this
one
anecdotally
my
friends
who
are
mds
including
my
main
buds
from
high
school
talk
about
how
hard
it
is
to
turn
states
witness
against
someone
else
no
direct
experience
there
though
also
in
some
circumstances
you
may
have
to
sue
the
insurance
plan
people
here
after
all
sue
health
insurance
companies
all
the
time
i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
disease
that
he
had
to
take
repeated
trips
to
seattle
to
get
treated
it
cost
him
and
his
family
something
like
and
the
province
years
later
still
has
only
reimbursed
them
for
or
so
well
what
american
private
insurance
plans
cover
travel
expenses
since
our
public
insurance
plans
are
publicly
accountable
one
can
raise
a
stink
in
the
media
to
try
and
extort
benefits
beyond
which
one
is
entitled
hey
not
albertas
fault
that
he
lives
there
if
he
lived
in
cheyenne
wy
his
private
insurance
wouldve
told
him
to
go
to
hell
for
the
travel
expenses
and
thats
that
an
hmo
would
have
just
kept
quiet
and
let
him
go
blind
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
bethesda
naval
hospital
since
not
all
hospitals
can
provide
everything
maybe
they
have
some
stuff
that
others
dont
ottawas
population
is
only
a
quarter
million
if
you
include
the
surrounding
counties
my
point
was
that
something
that
should
necessarily
remain
unpoliticized
has
become
very
politicized
to
the
detriment
of
its
mission
i
dont
think
that
this
has
been
shown
with
the
dmc
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
people
of
influence
will
get
their
way
in
any
system
american
or
european
its
the
golden
rule
he
who
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
but
to
what
extent
does
it
affect
the
system
and
why
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessary
in
the
first
place
its
worth
thinking
about
its
regular
practice
in
a
hospital
to
figure
out
who
needs
to
get
at
what
facilities
dont
americans
have
to
arrange
in
advance
for
operations
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standards
being
applied
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverly
hillsstyle
treatment
to
everybody
its
not
a
big
brother
list
its
more
like
calling
around
town
for
a
table
for
dinner
yeah
but
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
especially
in
the
hospital
business
yes
and
the
tories
in
ottawa
are
trying
to
make
them
do
that
rather
than
hope
for
a
bigger
grant
from
the
feds
and
their
province
the
next
time
around
whether
its
using
mop
a
couple
of
weeks
longer
or
even
selling
services
to
americans
remember
our
system
is
cash
based
and
since
our
health
care
infrastructure
is
overbuilt
except
in
specialties
that
require
larger
populations
to
generate
business
why
not
the
alternative
is
closing
unused
wards
business
whether
canadians
would
be
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
services
catering
toward
americans
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
another
issue
entirely
it
must
be
noted
that
they
said
they
were
doing
it
partly
because
their
grants
from
the
province
were
getting
smaller
if
those
grants
are
so
insubstantial
why
the
need
to
attract
foreigners
to
make
up
the
difference
you
answered
the
question
yourself
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
its
about
time
that
they
acted
like
the
private
hospitals
that
they
are
personally
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialists
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actually
buying
insurance
thats
one
at
you
bob
rae
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
and
are
compiled
use
the
same
methods
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
but
dont
the
us
figures
include
dentistry
and
optometry
where
the
canadian
one
until
recently
anyway
didnt
since
we
have
always
been
evaluated
in
an
oecd
style
i
dont
see
how
remember
oecd
counts
both
private
and
public
funds
and
in
canada
like
france
and
germany
of
health
care
spending
is
private
funds
ie
not
the
basic
health
insurance
money
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
how
they
are
collecting
premiums
and
im
an
advocate
of
having
copayments
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
well
if
you
spend
more
than
you
take
in
you
go
bankrupt
its
that
simple
if
the
provincial
insurance
systems
find
themselves
paying
out
more
than
they
get
in
revenue
they
wont
be
able
to
pay
for
everybodys
primary
care
yes
the
infrastructure
will
be
there
but
will
everybody
be
able
to
continue
using
it
at
the
same
rate
minor
copayments
can
flush
out
abusers
remember
that
our
system
is
only
an
insurance
policy
but
our
costs
arent
rising
fast
enough
to
ensure
adequate
copaymentsdeductibles
last
year
quebecs
userfee
proposal
came
out
with
the
number
of
as
the
necessary
hike
that
could
be
done
through
a
copayment
rather
than
give
the
qma
a
raise
and
its
not
contract
time
yet
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
upi
clarinet
even
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
holds
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
but
no
mention
of
copayments
anywhere
to
be
seen
but
cutting
public
spending
all
over
the
place
and
bringing
back
the
death
penalty
with
little
haste
if
elected
i
know
that
for
petes
sake
i
live
right
on
the
border
i
know
the
canadian
system
isnt
socialized
medicine
unlike
britains
nhs
sorry
its
just
that
i
even
run
into
people
from
buffalo
and
from
michigan
who
dont
know
the
point
is
that
means
that
if
the
money
runs
low
in
the
plan
youre
out
of
luck
unless
you
can
afford
it
yourself
yeah
but
thered
be
a
lot
of
leadtime
and
a
healthcare
crisis
that
would
preclude
it
if
provincial
governments
as
bad
as
some
of
them
are
heck
we
have
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
spending
mess
made
by
the
conservatives
in
saskatchewan
embarassing
can
be
so
irresponsible
there
is
still
reallocation
health
insurance
is
so
important
that
its
about
the
only
thing
that
can
inspire
open
rebellion
and
violent
insurrection
outside
of
the
hockey
rink
right
now
attempts
to
get
the
system
and
its
users
to
learn
good
habits
are
being
treated
like
codliver
oil
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
some
of
the
companies
providing
extra
insurance
are
subsidiaries
of
american
companies
and
their
parents
provide
full
insurance
down
here
regardless
all
firms
up
north
can
easily
turn
on
cable
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firms
are
doing
by
being
involved
in
basic
coverage
the
private
firms
are
making
too
much
money
after
having
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverage
they
run
around
patting
them
selves
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooperation
in
providing
extras
for
those
people
who
deserve
it
yeah
but
eventually
its
going
to
create
a
kind
of
twotiered
effect
that
will
be
noticeable
after
a
while
like
in
britain
most
americans
are
fearful
of
a
singletier
system
seriously
there
are
few
areas
that
have
sufficient
population
for
a
twomoretiered
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
policy
prof
dg
shea
has
cited
studies
in
the
nejm
that
indicate
having
a
population
of
is
necessary
for
adequate
competition
and
in
canada
there
are
only
four
cities
west
of
the
great
lakes
with
that
population
or
larger
anyways
the
numbers
show
that
costs
have
held
steadier
than
those
in
the
us
and
barring
any
future
chernobyllike
crisis
sudden
transients
in
spending
are
unlikely
in
fact
the
health
allocation
is
one
of
the
most
wellbehaved
sectors
of
spending
up
north
so
any
talk
of
bankruptcy
is
talkradio
fodder
far
away
from
the
border
if
the
provinces
hit
fiscal
rough
spots
and
have
to
cut
back
the
things
private
insurers
have
to
offer
will
seem
less
and
less
like
luxuries
and
the
gap
will
be
more
and
more
noticeable
this
wont
be
overnight
and
something
like
this
would
force
canada
to
have
a
system
more
like
the
french
one
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
and
the
change
will
be
minimal
ie
add
copayments

justified
by
the
increased

by
the
larger

bradford
himself
acknowledged
this
failure
of
communism
he
wrote
the
experience
that
was
had
in
this
common
course
and
condition
tried
sundry
years
and
that
amongst
godly
and
sober
men
may
well
evince
the
vanity
of
that
conceit
of
platos

other
ancients
applauded
by
some
of
later
times
that
the
taking
away
of
property
and
bringing
in
community
into

would
make
them
happy
and
flourishing
as
if
they
were
wiser
than
god
for
this
community
so
far
as
it
was
was
found
to
breed
much
confusion
and
discontent
and
retard
much
employment
that
would
have
been
to
their
benefit
and
comfort
bradford
did
not
blame
this
failure
on
the
strangers
but
on
the
basic
selfishness
in
all
men
he
wrote
seeing
all
men
have
this
corruption
in
them
god
in
his
wisdom
saw
another
course
fitter
for
them
in

westbrook
bradford
found
private
enterprise
to
be

most
suitable
economic
policy

not

basic

not

thanks

patrick
let
me
try
to
drag
this
discussion
back
to
the
original
issues
as
ive
noted
before
im
not
necessarily
disputing
the
benefits
of
eliminating
anticompetitive
legislation
with
regard
to
auto
dealers
barbers
etc
one
need
not
however
swallow
the
entire
libertarian
agenda
to
accomplish
this
end
just
because
one
grants
the
benefits
of
allowing
anyone
who
wishes
to
cut
hair
to
sell
hisher
services
without
regulation
does
not
mean
that
the
same
unregulated
barbers
should
be
free
to
bleed
people
as
a
medical
service
without
government
intervention
as
somemany
libertarians
would
argue
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
government
regulation
is
obviously
worthwhile
the
libertarian
agenda
however
does
not
call
for
this
assessment
it
assumes
that
the
costs
of
regulation
of
any
kind
always
outweigh
its
benefits
this
approach
avoids
all
sorts
of
difficult
analysis
but
it
strikes
many
of
the
rest
of
us
as
dogmatic
to
say
the
least
i
have
no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical
care
education
national
defense
or
local
police
that
suggests
a
free
market
can
provide
a
more
effective
efficient
means
of
accomplishing
social
objectives
than
is
provided
through
statist
approaches
with
some
notable
exceptions
however
i
do

solutions
do
people
have
that
would
have
been
better
than
what
the
fbi
had
been
doing
for
the
last
few
months
firstly
they
could
have
backed
off
when
you
put
a
power
freak
like
david
koresh
in
that
kind
of
situation
he
is
going
to
explode
no
pun
intended
koresh
wanted
to
be
a
martyr
and
the
government
played
right
into
his
hands
if
the
government
hadnt
given
him
the
attention
he
wanted
nothing
would
have
ever
happened
secondly
the
davidians
were
expecting
everything
the
government
did
they
thought
that
they
were
facing
the
apocalypse
and
that
they
were
to
perish
in
fire
they
werent
scared
of
the
fbi
they
are
not
the
average
hoods
they
are
very
devout
followers
of
a
religion
psyops
didnt
work
and
the
government
got
frustrated
so
they
murdered
them
the
batf
should
have
left
at
the
beginning
they
should
have
looked
at
koreshs
personality
instead
they
thought
they
have
guns
we
have
bigger
guns
lets
go
get
em
they
botched
it
from

one
they
shouldnt
have
been

in

the
above
conveniently
ignores
the
murder
of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
the
search
was
a
noknock
warrent
meaning
that
what
those
on
the
scene
see
is
a
bunch
of
men
with
guns
storming
their
compound
and
lobbing
grenades
at
them
the
terms
of
the
search
warrent
are
secret
and
the
batf
has
yet
to
even
reveal
what
they
were
the
stupidity
was
the
attempt
to
serve
a

on
the
place
by
ludicrously
underarmed

unprotected
police
they
did
not
serve
a
warrent
they
basically
attacked
the
compound
and
expected
a
surrender
they
had
semiautomatics
and
concussion
grenades
that
we
know
about
look
at
the
death
and
injury
toll
inflicted
on
both
sides
in

its
difficult
to

a

there

taboo
about

of

almost
anything

however
there
is
status
attached
to
being
able

fuck
constantly
and
with
gay
men
where
both
partners
can
prove
status
through
their
constant
verility
then
you
are
going
to
get
a
situation
where
there
is
a

of
sex
the
difference
is
between
het
sex
being
rationed
as
a
valuable
commodity
and
gay
sex
being
virtually
unlimited

tended

look

the

that
variatevalue
which
divides
the
distribution
halfway
ie
of
the
distribution
population
have
lower

half
have
higher
variatevalues
so
for
males
the
this
means
that
half
of
these
men
are
higher
than
this
and
half
are
lower
than
this
now
if
the
population
sample
size
is
and
of
them
are
gay
males
are
gay
if
we
actually
were
either
exclusively
homosexual
or
bisexual
you
arent
readiing
very
carefully
say
they
are
distributed
equally
then
only
are
greater
than
sexual
partners
of
course
this
means
that
heterosexual
men
are
greater

then
turn

use
it
to
support
some
position
you
present
seems
somewhat
contradictory
doesnt
it
i
believe
that
this
is
not
contradictory
on
the
basis
that
the
quality
of
media
reporting
varies
greatly
based
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
media
has
proven
itself
very
accurate
is
the
areas
of
presenting
raw
undisputed
data
one
good
example
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatures
of
the
previous
day
for
a
large
number
of
locations
are
posting
there
is
little
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
the
american
media
has
failed
us
in
its
analysis
of
complex
events
however
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
many
news
stories
that
have
left
us
angry
because
so
many
facts
have
been
ommitted
cases
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invasion
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disaster
in
waco
the
issues
surrounding
the
acceptance
of
gays
into
the
military
the
war
on
drugs
and
many
others
the
story
that
you
bring
to
light
was
regarding
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazyness
some
of
the
data
was
ommitted
from
the
article
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
the
data
that
was
presented
did
not
deviate
from
the
survey
i
do
however
think
that
it
would
be
folly
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
single
newswriters
analysis
of
this
data
in
this
particular
case
there
was
little
analysis
and
the
reader
was
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convictions
many
netters
mr
cramer
included
often
forget
that
the
american
media
are
merely
a
number
of
businesses
whos
purpose
in
life
is
to
make
money
for
their
owners
and
stockholders
revenues
come
largely
from
advertisers
who
merely
want
maximum
useful
exposure
per
dollar
the
media
is
like
fast
food
the
quality
of
the
food
or
of
the
reporting
will
improve
only
if
the
customers
demand
as
such
otherwise
it
is
business

usual

the

writes
statement
by
the

secretary
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the

of

while
also

according
to
the
report
ive
got
in

the
newsweek
article
which
reported
that
to
percent
of
the
population
is
gay
used
the
criteria
of
no
heterosexual
contact
in
the

year
but
at
the

time
the
university
of
denver
study
points
out
quite
dramatically
that
of
all
selfidentifying
gay
men
have
had
some
form
of
heterosexual
contact
in
the
past
year
i
think
the
big
mistake
in
that
study
must
be
that
if
one
had
had
no
sexual
contact
of
any
kind
in
the

year
they
are
counted
as
heterosexual
even
if
they

directly
contradicted
by
the
nejm
study
that
compared
crime
in
seattle
and
vancouver
bc
the
nongun
rates
were
roughly
the
same
for
both
cities
the
difference
in
violent
crime
rates
was
almost
totally
gunrelated
and
as
was
not
pointed
out
in
the
study
but
in
critiques
of
it
two
seperate
articles
by
james
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
difference
was
also
almost
entirely
minority
related
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocketed
for
poor
minorities
blacks
and
hispanics
primarily
while
when
you
compared
the
white
majority
they
were
virutally
identical
many
of
the
people
who
never
read
the
nejm
article
believe
that
this
critique
is
valid
in
fact
the
study
explores
the
minority
issue
at
length
and
cites
studies
to
back
up
its
contention
that
poverty
not
minority
type
is
the
relevant
factor
in
violence
statistics
perhaps
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
minorities
in
the
us
correlate
with
poverty
this
isnt
good
and
we
should
address
it
but
we
shouldnt
ignore
that
minorities
and
poverty
do
tend
to
go
together
does
vancouver
have
a
consistantly
poor
population
drawn
along
racial
lines
if
it
doesnt
then
assumptions
of
being
able
to
compare
minority
vs
majority
in
both
cities
is
questionable
at
best
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
areas
implemented
gun
control
because
of
the
high
rates
true
only
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
was
instituted
while
it
had
crime
problems
true
but
that
crime
proceeded
to
explode
afterwards
similarly
for
new
york
actually
i
dont
know
whether
any
serious
studies
have
been
done
for
both
cities
usenetstyle
statistical
arguments
are
not
very
serious
usually
involving
people
sitting
by
computers
with
the
latest
world
almanac
figures
i
had
heard
of
a
study
on
washington
dc
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
significant
drop
in
gunrelated
violence
there
after
the
laws
were
implemented
i
heard
gary
kleck
comment
on
the
radio
that
he
thought
the
decline
in
suicide
rates
was
related
to
the
new
laws
but
he
doubted
their
affect
on
other
gunrelated
violence
i
have
never
seen
a
report
on
the
study
nor
have
any
of
my
progun
friends
had
much
to
say
about
that
report
remember
you
cant
just
say
that
crime
increases
indicate
a
failure
of
the
laws
to
affect
crime
rates
you
dont
know
whether
the
rate
of
increase
would
have
been
different
without
the
laws
if
the
rate
of
increase
over
a
period
of
several
years
remains
unchanged
or
increases
i
think
its
not
a
far
jump
to
say
that
the
laws
are
not
effective
no
you
cant
sit
down
and
say
that
things
wouldnt
have
been
worse
i
dont
have
a
crystal
ball
and
neither
do
you
however
that
road
leads
us
to
a
place
where
it
is
impossible
to
critique
any
action
if
it
gets
down
to
be
it
might
have
been
worse
without
them
then
there
is
no
valid
objection
which
im
sure
would
amuse
certain
people
to
no
end
you
dont
know
whether
the
laws
prevented
a
threefoldincrease
or
failed
to
stop
a
twofold
increase
so
weve
got
a
situation
where
we
have
several
options
the
crime
rate
decreased
obviously
gun
control
worked
the
crime
rate
remained
the
same
it
would
have
been
worse
without
gun
control
the
crime
rate
increased
perhaps
the
laws
prevented
an
even
bigger
increase
cute
testing
ground
weve
got
all
responses
support
the
proposition
that
gun
control
works
the
question
is
this
did
washington
dc
experiance
an
increase
in
its
violent
andor
gun
crime
rate
which
was
greater
than
the
pattern
indicated
prior
to
the
implemented
gun
control
laws
if
it
did
then
the
suggestion
that
the
problem
the
gun
control
laws
were
designed
to
control
did
not
exist
in
their

matt
freivald
said
i
like
to
call
the
form
of
government
that
i
advocate
fractal
federalism
with
fractal
federalism
there
is
a
representative
national
government
that
has
only
certain
limited
powers
to
do
what
is
absolutely
necessary
at
that
level
next
there
are
the
state
governments
again
with
only
absolutely
necessary
powers
onward
to
counties
citiestownships
districts
and
neighborhoods
the
lowest
read
most
local
levels
are
the
ones
that
have
the
most
power
over
individuals
daytoday
lives
which
is
good
because
that
is
the
level
where
individuals
have
the
most
voice
you
know
if
you
take
all
this
to
its
logical
conclusion
doesnt
it
seem
that
the
real
lowest
level
the
level
where
individuals
have
the
most
voice
is
that
of
the
single
individuals
themselves
why
have
you
omitted
that
level
from
your
model
yes
and
the
individual
is
not
omitted
i
just
didnt
fully
articulate
the
principles
of
fractal
federalism
all
government
powers
derive
from
the
people
each
level
can
receive
a
new
power
from
the
level
below
through
the
amendment
process
where
a
true
consensus
say
a
majority
writes
that
power
into
the
constitution
of
the
level
above
in
the
case
of
the
lowest
level
an
amendement
is
passed
by
a
majority
vote
in
the
case
of
higher
levels
it
must
be
passed
by
of
the
legislatures
we
can
of
course
haggle
about
the
specifics
of
true
consensus
when
we
hold
our
constitutional
convention
once
a
power
has
been
granted
it
may
be
exercised
by
the
legislature
powers
not
in
the
original
constitutions
must
percolate
upward
starting
from
the
individual
the
ratification
process
for
the
original
constitutions
should
involve
consensus
and
not
simply
a
plurality
or
majority
granting
a
right
in
a
constitution
is
of
course
the
same
as
empowering
the
government
at
that
level
to
restrict
the
activities
of
the
governments
at
the
lower
levels
so
it
operates
in
the
same
way
as
the
amendment
process
again
that
crazy
resemblance
to
the
supposedbutnotactual
us
government
structure
this
government
structure
is
a
very
frustrating
one
for
those
people
read
liberals
who
would
like
to
have
concentrated
power
to
use
the
government
to
force
people
to
do
good
a
difficulttodefine
word
and
one
that
it
is
difficult
to
reach
a
consensus
on
it
is
also
a
frustrating
structure
for
those
who
want
to
use
the
government
to
dictate
personal
behavior
read
biggovernment
conservatives
i
personally
would
rather
see
those
types
of
people
frustrated
than
the
incredible
erosion
of
liberty
both
civil
and
economic
that
is
going
on
now
this
is
imho
a
good
government
stucture
for
those
who
see
the
role
of
government
as
the
protection
of
individual
liberties
while
still
recognizing
that
individuals
need
to
have
some
influence
in
the
type
of
community
that
they
live
in
a
free
market
works
on
government
not
just
economics
succesful
ideas
propogate
unsuccessful
ideas
die
what
is
your
definition
of
a
successful
idea
or
a
successful
government
one
which
maintains
peace
liberty
and
the
opportunity
for
happiness
for
its
people
while
working
within
the
realities
of
human
nature
you
do
bring
up
the
point
intentional
or
not
that
a
lasting
idea
is
by
no
means
necessarily
a
successful
idea
i
believe
that
fractal
federalism
would
at
least
bring
many
ideas
to
light
and
the
people
would
have
the
opportunity
to
democratically
choose
between
good
ideas
and
bad
ideas
if
the
docialists
er
i
mean
democrats
are
right
and
government
activism
fosters
a
prosperous
people
they
will
have
a
plethora
of
local
opportunities
to
check
their
thesis
if
libertopia
is
possible
it
will
arise
if
a
balanced
conservative
republic
is
democratically
received
as
the
best
level
of
government
activity
it
will
become
clear
to
the
people
that
it
is
best
as
far
as
set
the
moral
tone
is
concerned
if
a
community
does
not
collectively
want
to
put
up
with
prostitution
going
on
in
front
of
their
kids
why
should
they
have
to
if
a
community
does
not
want
to
see
proliferation
of
drugs
among
their
kids
why
should
they
have
to
for
the
same
reason
that
they
have
to
put
up
with
a
church
operating
right
out
in
the
open
where
their
kids
can
see
it
and
with
the
owner
of
the
house
across
the
street
flying
an
american
flag
right
out
there
in
the
open
every
day
in
front
of
their
kids
its
called
freedom
if
they
dont
like
the
ideas
to
which
their
kids
are
exposed
they
can
try
to
educate
and
persuade
their
kids
as
to
why
the
things
that
theyre
seeing
other
people
doing
are
wrong
or
bad
right
and
people
would
not
rescind
any
freedoms
read
empower
the
government
except
through
the
amendment
process
that
is
how
the
federal
government
is
supposed
to
work
now
but
the
supreme
soviet
er
i
mean
the
supreme
court
put
a
stop
to
that
republican
government
nonsense
in
my
hypothetical
government
if
there
were
a
constitutional
provision
empowering
the
government
to
regulate
churches
the
government
whatever
level
we
are
talking
about
could
indeed
ban
churches
the
constitutional
provision
would
be
invalid
if
a
higher
level
had
a
constitutional
provision
protecting
free
exercise
of
religion
the
uppermost
constitution
is
still
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
i
find
it
interesting
that
you
applaud
the
idea
of
freemarket
competition
among
various
ideas
and
yet
support
the
right
of
he
majority
in
a
community
to
suppress
ideas
which
they
dont
like
it
is
a
matter
of
individuals
being
able
to
control
their
own
associations
and
environment
not
a
matter
of
suppression
of
ideas
one
dilemma
of
the
human
condition
is
that
individuals
need
liberty
and
they
also
need
to
have
some
control
over
their
environment
in
my
fractal
federalism
government
certain
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitutions
other
rights
are
protected
simply
because
the
government
has
not
been
empowered
to
infringe
upon
them
when
a
consensus
is
reached
that
the
government
should
have
a
certain
power
then
freedom
is
infringed
upon
this
cannot
be
avoided
murder
statutes
infringe
upon
freedom
but
i
think
that
the
consensus
of
the
american
people
is
that
murder
statutes
are
a
good
idea
i
am
sure
that
many
parents
believe
that
they
have
a
right
to
control
the
environment
that
their
children
live
in
people
feel
that
they
have
a
right
to
sleep
peacefully
at
night
thus
there
are
noise
ordinances
there
are
zoning
laws
that
keep
businesses
from
overrunning
residential
neighborhoods
i
do
not
view
these
as
bad
things
certainly
some
individual
instances
are
bad
but
the
concept
is
not
necessarily
bad
i
view
them
as
the
people
in
a
community
having
some
control
over
the
type
of
community
that
they
live
in
i
see
the
alternative
as
near
anarchy
like
i
said
in
another
post
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
scenario
where
an
individual
can
do
something
truly
autonomously
with
absolutely
zero
effect
on
anyone
else
then
no
individual
or
government
has
the
right
to
restrict
that
activity
there
are
simply
not
very
many
behaviors
that
fit
into
the
category
of
the
truly
autonomous
so
the
whole
thing
becomes
an
issue
of
one
individual
or
group
having
power
over
another
individual
or
group
i
think
that
the
fractal
federalism
approach
is
a
sound
if
not
ideal
approach
to
limiting
this
restrictive
power
the
libertarian
scenario
degenerates
to
might
makes
right
and
the
system
we
have
right
now
is
one
of
lawyers
abusing
natural
rights
philosophy
to
decide
what
powers
the
government
should
have
by
subverting
the
democratic
process
though
the
supreme
court
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tries
to
deny
the
fundamental
dilemma
of
democratic
government
the
people
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
in
their
community
yet
individuals
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselves
this
is
a
serious
dilemma
precisely
because
there
is
not
much
that
takes
place
in
a
vacuum
oddly
enough
if
what
you
say
is
taken
literally
there
is
little
or
no
conflict
the
people
do
indeed
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
where
voice
equals
persuasive
speech
in
their
communities
its
only
when
they
somehow
get
the
idea
into
their
heads
that
they
also
have
a
right
to
dictate
behavior
in
their
communities
that
the
trouble
begins
i
think
i
answered
this
above
already
but
let
me
expand
a
little
more
with
an
example
if
i
stand
naked
in
front
of
your
house
and
masturbate
in
front
of
your
children
while
they
play
in
your
libertarian
small
l
scenario
the
only
recourse
you
have
is
to
yell
at
me
autonomous
is
a
value
judgement
of
the
time
it
is
not
a
scientific
reality
with
a
clear
definition
exactly
who
would
you
empower
to
make
that
value
judgement
stuff
deleted
certainly
not
the
only
cause
mike
but
people
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voice
in
what
goes
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deny
this
is
to
create
another
concentrated
centralized
power
to
keep
the
locality
from
abusing
its
power
in
essence
using
a
pit
bull
to
keep
a
toy
poodle
from
biting
your
leg
chances
are
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
on
you
some
day
and
you
have
much
less
defense
against
it
than
you
do
against
the
toy
poodle
the
argument
here
appears
to
be
that
tyranny
of
the
individual
by
the
local
majority
is
superior
to
having
the
federal
government
have
and
exercise
the
power
to
protect
the
individual
from
his
neighbors
because
that
federal
government
will
eventually
and
inevitably
become
corrupt
and
use
its
power
to
tyrannize
everyone
okay
theres
a
lot
of
truth
in
that
certainly
were
seeing
something
like
that
happening
in
the
united
states
today
though
its
unclear
that
he
progression
here
matches
the
model
since
our
beloved
and
benign
federal
government
hasnt
evershown
much
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
of
protecting
any
individuals
lots
of
people
are
long
on
complaints
and
short
on
practical
solutions
although
i
am
pessimistic
that
my
idea
will
ever
bear
fruit
i
am
at
least
trying
to
be
long
on
solutions
also
i
am
truly
interested
if
you
have
any
improvements
to
make
on
my
ideas
i
call
them
my
ideas
but
they
all
come
from
an
average
guy
reading
of
the
us
constitution
without
benefit
of
the
indoctrination
of
constitutional
law
academia
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
your
solution
is
at
least
just
as
bad
trading
the
yoke
of
federal
tyranny
for
the
yoke
of
local
tyranny
doesnt
cheer
me
up
much
i
think
id
prefer
to
put
my
faith
in
a
larger
government
that
at
least
might
protect
the
individual
from
time
to
time
rather
than
place
it
in
local
mob
rule
admittedly
its
the
lesser
of
two
evils
and
its
not
less
by
very
much
and
theyre
both
pretty
damn
evil
sorry
the
confusion
was
my
fault
when
i
said
that
fractal
federalism
resembles
the
us
constitution
i
meant
it
and
thought
it
was
pretty
clear
i
should
have
more
clearly
explained
that
the
ultimate
derivation
of
government
power
is
from
the
consensus
of
the
people
although
not
the
consent
of
every
individual
a
practical
observation
not
a
moral
judgement
it
is
certainly
better
than
having
all
government
power
derive
from
nine
lawyers
which
is
the
situation
we
have
now
that
is
why
i
think
the
supreme
court
should
be
a
jury
court
with
a
different
jury
for
each
case
it
is
certainly
not
perfect
no
philosophy
of
government
is
but
do
you
still
find
it
a
repugnant
idea
if
so
what
is
your
solution
ideally
everyone
would
leave
everyone
else
alone
and
no
government
coercive
power
of
any
kind
would
be
necessary
this
will
never
work
because
people
are
different
and
by
their
nature
they
will
always
want
to
force
their
views
on
others
if
this
were
not
the
case
nobody
would
try
to
force
their
view
that
murder
is
wrong
on
anyone
else
this
is
true
the
question
is
what
we
you
going
to
do
about
it
your
proposed
solution
seems
to
actually
encourage
these
bozos
to
lord
it
over
their
victims
i
think
that
you
misunderstood
the
structure
of
the
form
of
government
i
advocate
and
it
was
my
fault
for
not
being
more
clear
oh
and
by
the
way
liborgalism
thinking
is
irrelevant
integrity
is
irrelevant
free
speech
is
irrelevant
private
property
is
irrelevant
personal
responsibility
is
irrelevant
conservativism
is
futile
you
will
be
assimilated
how
much
would
freedom
of
speech
or
private
property
rights
be
respected
in
a
community
in
which
the
majority
was
allowed
to
make
all
the
rules
that
mans
saying
things
in
public
that
i
dont
want
my
children
exposed
to
lets
shut
him
up
those
homos
are
living
together
and
fornicating
in
that
house
over
there
lets
run
em
outta
town
the
majority
does
not
make
the
rules
the
majority
or
possibly
a
plurality
simply
elects
representatives
to
exercise
limited
government
powers
those
limited
government
powers
derive
from
a
large
consensus
not
a
simple
majority
and
the
federal
government
in
my
scenario
still
has
the
power
to
protect
freedoms

you
ever

a

canister
tear
gas
is
produced

burning

the

produced
are
tear

the

has

how
many

did
they
throw

they

was

i
have
heard
two

recently
explaining
this
they
pumped
the
gas
into
the
building
from
outside
via
some
sort
of
pipe
rather
than
by
canister
the
sort
of
tear
gas
they
are
using
was
described
as
some
sort
of
powdery
material
that
sticks
to
things
kind
of
like
a

cloud

once

these
are

lacky
explainations
and
since
government
stories
always
change
none

of

might
not
be
true
this
whole
thing
was
a
case
of
overreaction
by
the

at

i
hope
it
is
thoroughly
investigated
and
the

parties
are
held
accountable
but
that
is
highly
unlikely
when
you
figure
they
are

the

of
four
batf
agents
by
the
branch
davidians
in
an
unprovoked
ambush
as
youre
no
doubt
aware
phill
there
are
probably
five
or
six
different
mutually
contradictory
versions
of
the
events
in
waco
on
feb
all
of
which
are
from
reputable
news
sources
ranging
the
the
associated
press
to
time
to
newsweek
some
of
the
earliest
reports
issued
by
the
ap
were
not
at
all
flattering
the
to
batf
and
produced
some
question
as
to
who
fired
first
now
for
all
i
know
you
were
there
to
witness
it
but
i
kind
of
doubt
that
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
batf
in
a
letter
theyve
been
sending
out
to
people
says
both
that
they
were
ambushed
because
they
lost
the
element
of
surprise
and
that
they
went
up
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
had
it
slammed
in
their
faces
it
strikes
me
as
kind
of
strange
to
rely
on
surprise
to
serve
a
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
there
are
at
least
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
this
paranoid
assertation
was
made
by
witnesses
to
the
original
assault
who
stated
that
the
batf
initiated
hostilities
by
throwing
concussion
grenades
and
reported
by
the
associated
press
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
phill
the
batf
were
in
a
firefight
with
the
bd
for
fortyfive
minutes
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
they
were
expecting
peaceful
citizens
they
wouldnt
have
shown
up
in
livestock
trailers
and
would
have
retreated
immediately
if
they
were

beleive
the

a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the

of
his

according
to
the
account
given
the

attempted

serve

upon

at
the

and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire

story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get

control
legislation
through
i
must
object
to
the
characterization
of
those
opposed
to
the
governments
handling
of
the
waco
situation
as
gun
supporters
your
argument
tries
to
paint
the
batf
critics
as
rightwing
gun
nuts
and
just
mixes
up
two
issues
i
am
one
of
the
batffbi
critics
and
yet
i
am
a
liberal
and
just
as
antigun
as
you
are
i
just
happen
to
believe
that
everyone
has
civil
rights
even
religious
crazies
theyre
all
human
beings
not
some
nest
of
wasps
that
youre
trying
to
exterminate
the
batf
created
the
crisis
situation
by
the
way
they
handled
the
original
raid
it
was
well
known
that
koresh
regularly
went
jogging
outside
his
property
he
could
have
been
served
with
a
search
warrant
then
he
could
have
been
arrested
if
he
had
refused
to
comply
instead
officers
armed
with
grenades
invaded
the
property
this
escalated
into
a
shooting
war
with
tragic
deaths
on
both
sides
those
were
the
first
two
mistakes
the
bad
judgment
of
asking
for
a
noknock
warrant
and
the
bad
and
probably
illegal
way
the
alreadyunwise
warrant
was
served
at
this
point
the
situation
escalated
to
where
it
was
described
as
an
armed
standoff
and
a
hostage
crisis
thats
when
the
government
started
covering
their
traces
sealing
the
warrant
revising
their
reported
history
of
the
incident
etc
things
were
already
building
up
to
disaster
now
the
government
could
have
simply
closed
the
supply
routes
and
waited
but
according
to
janet
reno
that
option
had
never
been
seriously
considered
so
supposedly
because
the
agents
were
frustrated
and
fatigued
and
because
there
supposedly
were
no
backups
they
felt
they
had
to
go
in
yes
the
govt
handled
it
in
the
rambo
hollywood
type
style
with
extreeme
machismo
perhaps
thats
not
the
way
to
handle
it
it
is
a
completely
different
thing
to
start
asserting
as
many
have
done
that
the
government
is
primarily
to
blame
the
comparisons
with
the
nazis
in
particular
are
purely
gratuitous
since
you
have
provided
a
constructive
opinion
on
the
issue
your
post
desreves
to
be
taken
seriously
peter
nelson
also
made
some
very
good
points
about
how
a
low
key
approach
might
have
been
more
effective
the
point
is
though
that
you
learn
through
mistakes
the
govt
played
the
wrong
card
and
lost
thats
not
a
big
deal
they
had
had
four
guys
murdered
at
the
begining
and
maybee
they
just
were
not
prepared
for
wuite
this
situation
who
could
be
if
the
same
thing
were
to
happen
all
over
again
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
castigate
the
govt
if
they
used
the
same
tactics
and
failed
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
i
cant
say
that
i
would
not
have
made
the
same
mistake
maybee
i
wouldnt
because
i
dont
as
a
rule
go
in
for
a
confrontational
situation
if
i
can
avoid
it
maybee
i
would
because
with
all
those
press
about
its
very
difficult
not
to
try
the
macho
stuff
the
fbi
had
information
from
within
the
compound
we
had
no
access
to
they
may
have
calculated
that
the
bd
followers
resolve
was
cracking
based
on
their
listening
devices
within
the
compound
they
knew
that
koresh
had
chickened
out
of
one
suicide
attempt
this
may
have
been
the
reason
why
they
considered
that
fear
might
have
been
a
weapon
for
breaking
his
resolve
again
in
panama
they
had
used
the
heavy
rock
music
to
great
effect
during
bushs
invasion
funny
that
few
of
the
koresh
supporters
and
appologists
complain
much
about
the
death
of
several
thousand
pananmanian
civilians
while
the
us
govt
attempted
to
arrest
their
former
ally
and
please
lets
not
turn
this
into
a
progun
vs
antigun
discussion
antigun
people
do
not
believe
that
gunowners
deserve
to
get
frontally
assaulted
by
armed
government
agents
and
koreshs
civil
rights
exist
whether
his
guns
were
legal
illegal
illegalbutshouldhavebeenlegal
or
whatever
koresh
negated
his
civil
rights
the
minute
his
followers
fired
on
the
police
helicopter
no
matter
whether
the
warrant
was
or
was
not
technically
valid
the
guys
who
were
carrying
it
out
thought
that
it
was
thus
the
assault
on
them
was
completely
inexcusable
no
matter
what
rationalisation
people
might
wish
to
employ
of
course
we
have
to
consider
the
guns
issue
that
is
the
whole

of
the

everything

you

dont

in

i
had

pulled
on

had

who
were

i
was
beaten
up
repeatedly
by
those
that
couldnt
accept
me
as
different
and
dont
let
the

off
the
hook
either
on
many
many

there
were

that
either
resented
me
or
were
too
scared
out

by
the

to
even
stop
the

who
attacked
me

they
would
just

quietly
all

this
was

we
were

this

you

that

me
as
kind

strange
to
rely

carries
no

poor

only
has
to
give
lip

to
promoting

to
be
within
the
limits
of

sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of
the
constitution
article
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxesto
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in
article
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions
right
james
madison
federalist
paper
it
has
been
urged

that
the
power
to

collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defense

to
an

to
exercise
every
power
which
may
be
alleged
to
be
necessary
for
the

no
stronger
proof
could
be
given

labor

their
stooping

such
a
misconstruction
had
no
other
enumeration
or
definition
of
the
powers
of

been
found
in
the

than
the
general
expressions
just
cited
the
authors
of
the
objection
might
have
had
some
color
for
it
but
what
color
can
the
objection
have
when
a
specification
of
the
objects
alluded
to
by
these
general
terms
immediately
follows
and
is
not
even
separated
by
a
longer
pause
than
a
semicolon
nothing
is
more
natural

first

oh
are
we
jill
let
me
tell
you
a
story
then
one
evening
not
long
in
this
country
a
man
a
parolee
a
convicted
known
violent
crimminal
lead
police
on
high
speed
chase
after
breaking
another
law
he
decided
that
police
had
no
right
to
do
their
jobs
and
enforce
the
law
and
assualted
two
of
while
attempting
to
resist
arrest
when
police
use
metal
sticks
to
force
him
into
submission
we
heard
all
the
reason
why
certain
people
in
this
country
have
and
excuse
when
they
refuse
to
obey
the
law
how
this
was
a
perfect
example
of
police
oppression
how
all
the
police
had
to
do
was
behave
a
certain
way
and
all
would
have
been
finei
how
nothing
the
victim
did
could
have
possibly
warranted
the
response
some
blows
with
a
few
sticks
he
got
from
the
authorities
funny
how
when
its
bloodbath
billy
or
his
hitwench
calling
the
shots
a
group
of
people
who
were
bothering
no
one
were
not
know
to
have
broken
any
law
who
asked
only
that
they
be
left
alone
to
practice
their
religion
as
they
fit
how
it
is
now
that
the
government
is
justified
in
assualting
those
people
with
heavily
armed
commandos
simply
because
the
gun
grabbers
in
dc
thought
these
people
had
more
guns
thay
they
thought
they
should
have
now
when
its
the
clinton
administration
that
has
the
blood
of
dozens
on
its
hand
aaaall
of
a
sudden
its
the
people
who
refused
to
have
their
civil
rights
violated
its
their
fault
those
evil
fanatics
provoked
it
how
is
it
in
the
mind
of
the
liberal
democratclinton
supporter
that
a
crimminal
puke
scum
bag
piece
of
garbage
like
rodney

could
not
have
possibly
provoked
the
beating
he
got
but
this
bunch

could
cause
a

that
ended
with
the
burning
deaths
of
all
of
them
and
their
children
all
by
themselves
with
no

from

people
say
they
deserved
what
they
got

the
blame
rest
solely
with

the

that

all
to

from

in

that
in
a
liberal

vision
of

only
a
certain
select

people
can
expect
to

enforced
and
this

peter

posted
a
very
eloquent
response
to
this
point
in
talkpoliticsmisc
so
i
need
not
consume
more
bandwidth
here
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tries
to
deny
the
fundamental
dilemma
of
democratic
government
the
people
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
in
their
community
yet
individuals
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselves
this
is
a
serious
dilemma
precisely
because
there
is
not
much
that
takes
place
in
a
vacuum
you
are
seriously
misusing
the
word
egalitarian
you
should
look
the
word
up
before
you
use
it
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
equal
justice
under
the
law
and
egalitarianism
what
i
meant
if
it
was
not
clear
was
the
intersection
set
of
liberal
and
libertarian
philosophies
of
natural
rights
and
how
the
government
and
constitutional
interpretation
in
particular
fits
into
that
philosophy
this
philosophy
engages
in
the
very
serious
practical
error
of
endowing
the
nine
lawyers
on
the
supreme
court
with
an
almost
totalitarian
authority
completely
outside
of
the
consent
or
consensus
of
the
people
this
is
why
supreme
court
nominations
are
such
amazing
political
fistfights
these
days
because
he
who
controls
the
court
rules
the
country
the
people
on
the
court
may
well
be
trying
to
do
the
best
job
they
can
but
they
are
at
best
a
benevolent
oligarch
even
if
you
approve
of
every
supreme
court
decision
ever

would
be

a
great

those

would

nonenumerated

at
any
level
as
in
european
parlamentary

and
the
current
defacto

in

us
have
essentially
engaged
in
the

fundamental
mistake
except
that
it
is
some
different
body
that
has
the
totalitarian
virtually
unchecked
except
by

or

government

and
why
should
your

be
allowed
to
stop
my
activities
when
im
not
picking
your
pocket
or
defrauding
you
just
because
you
dont
like
it
because
you
find
it
morally
repugnant
this
is
like
asking
why
the
wind
blows
unless
you
can
prove
that
the
fact
of
your
engaging
in
certain
activities
has
absolutely
no
effect
whatsoever
on
any
other
human
being
who
has
not
consented
to
your
engagement
in
those
activities
very
few
human
activities
indeed
fit
into
this
category
even
for
those
few
that
do
who
would
you

to
make
the

is

picking

security
and

not
also
a
part
of
a
persons
assets
what
gives
you
the
right
to
create
a
moral
environment
that
a
parent
strongly
objects
to
what
gives
you
the
right
to
create
an
environment
of
social
unrest
and
instability
if
you
say
that
what
you
do
does
not
have
those
effects
by
what
authority
do
you
say
that
who
is
empowered
to
make
these
value
judgements
how
would
you
feel
if
i
got
a
gang
together
and
found
xtianity
or
insert
your
favorite
cause
here
morally
repugnant
and
passed
laws
to
outlaw
its
free
exercise
all
at
a
local
level
since
that
seems
to
be
aok
with
you
if
the
federal
constitution
explicitly
prohibited
you
from
doing
so
the
federal
government
would
prevent
you
from
doing
so
if
it
did
not
and
you
could
muster
enough
local
support
to
pass
an
amendment
to
the
local
constitution
by
say
a
majority
empowering
the
local
government
to
do
so
then
i
would
have
to
vote
with
my
feet
and
move
to
a
neighborhood
more
friendly
to
my
own
system
of
values
this
is
not
an
ideal
situation
but
it
is
far
better
than
the
mess
we
are
mired
in
right
now
as
to
the
gang
of
pitchfork
and
torch
wielding
friends
there
are
very
few
restrictive
local
laws
that
i
personally
would
advocate
or
vote
for
since
i
am
of
the
view
that
exercising
government
power
over
your
neighbors
should
be
done
with
extreme
care
and
only
when
absolutely
necessary
but
i
do
believe
in
protecting
children
from
victimization
by
people
who
have
callous
disregard
for
the
effects
they
have
on
others
i
would
certainly
leave
a
wellbehaved
massage
parlor
alone
so
long
as
it
had
no
detrimental
effects
on
the
neighborhood
you
just
dont
get
it
the
debate
is
not
whether
you
or
a
communitity
would
or
would
not
vote
away
my
rights
it
is
the
propriety
of
whether
that
should
even
be
an
option
when
you
define
rights
very
broadly
there
is
no
practical
choice
about
whether
people
will
or
will
not
infringe
upon
your
rights
since
these
rights
overlap
even
when
rights
are
defined
very
narrowly
the
government
has
been
empowered
to
prevent
others
from
infringing
on
your
rights
the
fundamental
question
is
by
whose
authority
is
that
power
created
if
you
support
the
current
situation
with
a
natural
rights
supreme
court
rather
than
an
original
understanding
supreme
court
or
even
better
supreme
court
by
jury
you
are
consenting
to
having
nine
lawyers
in
washington
dc
create
those
powers
out
of
the
air
in
my
fractal
federalism
scenario
it
is
a
broad
consensus
of
the
people
ie
the
amendment
process
that
creates
those
powers
certainly
not
the
only
cause
mike
but
people
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voice
in
what
goes
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deny
this
is
to
create
another
concentrated
centralized
power
to
keep
the
locality
from
abusing
its
power
you
mean
that
horrific
centralized
power
the
individual
no
i
mean
the
federal
government
that
comes
trucking
in
with
guns
to
tell
the
locals
how
to
run
their
neighborhood
waco
tx
is
a
nice
example
in
essence
using
a
pit
bull
to
keep
a
toy
poodle
from
biting
your
leg
chances
are
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
on
you
some
day
and
you
have
much
less
defense
against
it
than
you
do
against
the
toy
poodle
ideally
everyone
would
leave
everyone
else
alone
and
no
government
coercive
power
of
any
kind
would
be
necessary
this
will
never
work
because
people
are
different
and
by
their
nature
they
will
always
want
to
force
their
views
on
others
if
this
were
not
the
case
nobody
would
try
to
force
their
view
that
murder
is
wrong
on
anyone
else
fine
when
they
force
their
views
on
others
prosecute
them
until
then
leave
them
alone
this
is
such
a
simple
concept
how
do
you
feel
about
speech
codes
hate
speech
certainly
could
be
considered
an
indication
that
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
some
day
should
the
community
be
allowed
to
limit
it
too
if
not
why
not
if
you
create
a
community
where
public
masturbation
is
permitted
in
the
cause
of
personal
autonomy
have
you
done
anything
different
what
precisely
are
these
autonomous
activities
you
are
referring
to
if
you
list
them
perhaps
we
can
get
enough
people
to
agree
that
they
are
truly
autonomous
and
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
protecting
them
and
how
do
you
feel
about
david
koresh
did
he
deserve
it
should
the
batf
or
a
local
version
of
same
be
allowed
to
toss
him
in
jail
just
because
they
think
hes
off
his
rocker
the
koresh
incident
appears
to
be
a
horrendous
abuse
of
government
power
power
possibly
illegitimately
obtained
through
a
means
i
would
abolish
the
constitutionality
of
noknock
warrants
seems
very
dubious
to
me
not
to
mention
the
mere
existence
of
batf
and
the
governments
propensity
to
ignore
the
word
infringe
in
the
second

this
power
is
upheld
by
the
same
body
with
its
incredible
concentration
of
power
in
the
hands
of
nine
people
that
has
upheld
much
socalled
civil

read
affirmative

legislation
despite
the
fourteenth

who
said
anything
about
the
public
till
get
rid
of
it
and
get

i
agree
about
getting
rid

till

sure
you
dont
want
to
come
over

you
might
not

i
might
not

like

but
at
least
we
can
agree
to
let
each
other
live
the
kind
of
life
we
want
to
at
the
point
you
get
rid
of

its

of

whether

how
about

well
it
wasnt
just
the
travel

it
was
the
whole
treatment
when
you
buy
insurance
where
you
live
it
is
based
on
the
local
rates
tourists
coming
from

will
find
that
there
is

what
they

but
to
what
extent
does
it
affect
the
system
and
why
is
an
urgent

list
necessary
in
the
first
place
its
worth
thinking
about
its
regular
practice
in
a
hospital
to
figure
out
who
needs
to
get
at
what
facilities
dont
americans
have
to
arrange
in
advance
for
operations
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standards
being
applied
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverly
hillsstyle
treatment
to
everybody
its
not
a
big
brother
list
its
more
like
calling
around
town
for
a
table
for
dinner
but
americans
need
far
less
advance
time
to
book
operations
it
would
depend
on
where
you
live
downtown
toronto
or
mile
british
columbia
just
like
cheyenne
wy
vs

ma
again
geography
rears
its
ugly
head
since
our
health
care
providers
are
private
they
depend
on
an
adequate
market
size
in
order
to
sustain
enough
business
since
our
health
care
professionals
have
equivalent
takehome
pay
to
their
american
cousins
its
not
that
theyre
being
paid
too
little
to
provide
services
whether
canadians
would
be
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
services
catering
toward
americans
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
another
issue
entirely
it
must
be
noted
that
they
said
they
were
doing
it
partly
because
their
grants
from
the
province
were
getting
smaller
if
those
grants
are
so
insubstantial
why
the
need
to
attract
foreigners
to
make
up
the
difference
you
answered
the
question
yourself
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
its
about
time
that
they
acted
like
the
private
hospitals
that
they
are
personally
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialists
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actually
buying
insurance
thats

anybody
compete

reading
that
that
sort
of
private
health
insurance
is
actually
illegal
in
canada
i
have
only
hear
americans
say
that
its
illegal
but
i
could
be
wrong
just
have
never
heard
it
from
a
canadian
source
our
private
insurance
has
recently
balked
in
quebec
when
the
liberals
proposed
privatizing
some
aspects
of
routine
care
also
our
insurance
was
put
in
place
when
no
ndp
labour
governments
were
in
power
in
any
province
to
derail
the
effort
cos
they
wanted
real
socialized
medicine
youre
not
buying
insurance
so
much
as
being
coerced
into
one
insurance
plan
no
it
is
optional
as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept
it
there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in
particular
that
ask
for
exemptions
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
interesting
side
notehave
any
new
insurance
companies
started
upfrom
scratchsince
medicare
became
standard
in
canada
i
actually
have
doubts
that
any
new
ones
have
emerged
since
ww
i
no
scratch
that
there
are
a
few
in
western
canada
and
quite
a
few
in
quebec
as
part
of
the
quebec
miracle
out
with

which

up

a
very

kind

and
the

saw
a
lot
of
odd
alliances
labour

and

old

who
wanted
to
preserve
their
traditional
monopolies
on
one
side
and
entrepreneurs
and
internationally
oriented
businesses
and
professionals
on
the
other
the
final
trudeau
administration
and
the
first
mulroney
government
had
a
high
percentage
of
nouveaux
riches
who
knew
what
it
was
like
to
make
your
own
money
and
that
motivated
the
mcdonald
commission
under
trudeau
which
set
up
brians
initiative
macaroni
was
against
free

til
he
did
a
head
count
of
his
caucus
after
the
election
its
not
really
insurance
if
you
dont
have
alternatives
well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
btw
there
are
always
pacifists
in
the
news
arguing
about
their
portion
of
taxes
but
never
people
arguing
over
health
insurance
alternatives
and
were
talking
about
a
press
that
is
hostile
to
whomever
is
in
government
regardless
of
party
one
of
their
few
redeeming
characteristics
it
seems
also
in
the
april
globe
and
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
the
director
of
trauma
services
at
st
michaels
hospital
in
toronto
responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that
canada
rationed
vital
services
the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his
name
said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital
services
as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the
health
insurance
plan
in
fairness
he
did
say
that
both
the
us
and
canadian
systems
are
in
the
same
situation
the
only
way
to
hit
at
the
canadian
system
is
transient
periods
of
high
demand
which
is
more
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopolys
tight
fist
on
the
licencing
an
obvious
difference
is
that
in
such
a
transient
period
the
rationing
is
of
the
nature
of
a
mob
battling
over
cabbage
patch
dollstm
as
weve
seen
recently
as
opposed
by
rationing
by
ability
to
pay
but
the
former
is
a
transient
situation
and
if
a
large
body
of
insured
patients
were
to
deluge
the
california
health
infrastructure
the
same
would
result
rationing
among
the
insured
population
with
smaller
markets
there
is
much
less
flexibility
when
dealing
with
our
insured
population
than
california
which
by
the
way
has
more
people
than
canada
in
a
much
more
dense
area
so
he
is
correct
in
that
the
resources
are
fixed
for
a
particular
time
window
or
as
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopoly
licencing
according
to
the
market
steady
state
in
either
case
as
for
being
refused
treatment
the
government
of
the
day
would
be
shredded
to
tatters
if
something
like
that
were
to
happen
canadians
can
be
geographically
bad
too
not
realizing
that
their
health
care
is
private
while
only
their
insurance
isnt
too
many
people
have
bought
into
socialist
trype
that
we
have
socialized
medicine
i
know
i
know
the
monopoly
power
of
canadian
doctors
often
leads
them
to
overstate
the
problems
with
the
system
in
order
to
get
more
money
from
the
government
another
case
of
businessmen
once
scratched
becoming
socialists
right
as
ive
pointed
out
above
but
hasnt
that
just
shifted
the
locus
of
the
problem
from
one
place
to
the
other
it
hasnt
really
solved
it
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
people
too
often
tend
to
put
prescription
cold
medicine
on
their
insurance
when
they
really
dont
need
to
thats
why
ive
argued
for
deductible
and
copayments
rather
than
education
which
is
what
most
canadian
fiscal
conservatives
are
arguing
for
the
leftists
ah
just
let
em
spend
yeah
right
also
note
that
only
a
few
provinces
cover
prescriptions
under
some
high
dollar
threshold
in
most
its
your
private
insurance
that
covers
it
just
like
in
the
us
still
it
all
adds
up
in
the
oecd
measures
in
fact
buffalo
may
be
the
only
place
in
the
us
where
people
get
don
cherry
jokes
we
get

as
a

on

tonight
the

ny

supplants
the
main

the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
tory
spending
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
politics
yeah
its
a
sad
story
and
saskatchewan
tory
leader
grant
devine
has
been
on
a
nonstop
pr
campaign
to
save
his
sorry
butt
the
sask
ndp
have
taken
a
neoconservative
turn
like
hawke
gonzalez
and
mitterand
did
has
anybody
considered
following
singapores
example
and
going
to
a
system
where
the
company
and
the
state
buys
basic
and
catastrophic
coverage
for
everybody
and
then
you
also
have
an
ira
sort
of
thing
to
which
you
and
your
employer
can
can
contribute
for
medical
expenses
only
it
would
tend
to
discourage
you
from
overusing
it
the
medical
ira
would
have
limited
use
as
youd
need
a
lower
catastrophic
threshold
else
thered
still
be
a
drain
on
the
public
purse
if
someone
exhausts
their
ira
also
singapore
has
a
much
more
autocratic
mentality
which
has
seaped
down
into
its
masses
if
singaporeans
that
ive
met
are
any
indication
i
dont
mean
any
disprespect
here
where
theyd
let
you
just
die
one
of
the
good
things
about
being
the
last
country
to
create
a
national
health
care
system
should
we
decide
to
is
that
we
have
everybody
elses
mistakes
to
learn
from
thats
true
the
question
is
how
much
leeway
is
there
between
the
us
approach
and
the
secondmost
capitalist
approaches
of
canada
france
and
germany
seriously
there
are
few
areas
that
have
sufficient
population
for
a
twomoretiered
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
policy
prof
dg
shea
has
cited
studies
in
the
nejm
that
indicate
having
a
population
of
is
necessary
for
adequate
competition
and
in
canada
there
are
only
four
cities
west
of
the
great
lakes
with
that
population
or
larger
but
there
are
many
cities
in
the
us
with
that
kind
of
population
yes
many
and
pretty
close
to
a
lot
of
smaller
towns
or
not
too
far
from
a
bigger
town
just
take
a
look
at
a
detailed
atlas
or
better
take
a
flight
from
pittsburgh
or
rochester
to
toronto
my
first
time
across
lake
ontario
to
nyc
i
was
amazed
by
the
increase
in
density
and
the
toronto
region
is
the
densest
in
all
of
canada
there
was
one
about
a
group
of
doctors
in
calgary
who
have
opened
canadas
first
usstyle
mri
clinic
as
an
alternative
to
the
provincially
owned
one
its
about
time
ive
ragged
on
my
own
doctor
friends
as
to
why
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
private
practices
in
the
end
its
their
money
but
they
choose
to
spend
it
on
americas
cup
pipedreams
and
thats
none
of
my
business
as
for
provincially
owned
for
sure
its
against
the
law
in
canada
for
governments
to
be
directly
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care
except
in
the
military
or
native
reser
vations
what
that
term
actually
means
is
that
the
facility
gets
by
on
public
grants
to
meet
shortfall
from
lack
of
use
no
kidding
medical
practice
itself
is
much
more
conservative
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkships
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicine
but
his
boat
comes
first
there
were
some
people
expressing
concern
that
it
was
the
first
wedge
of
twotiered
health
care
and
that
it
might
violate
the
canada
health
act
no
its
probably
socialist
whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
since
the
french
and
germans
have
become
more
entrepreneurial
and
less
laidback
without
sacrificing
their
culture
and
values
then
canadians
can
do
the
same
as
ive
pointed
out
above
the
law
states
that
it
is
illegal
for
the
government
to
provide
any
health
services
except
for
the
military
and
natives
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying

says
both
that
they

they
lost
the
element

and
that
they
went
up
and
knocked
on
the

and
had
it
slammed
in

faces
it
strikes
me
as
kind
of
strange
to
rely
on
surprise
to
serve
a
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
presumably
the
bd
did
not
mount
a
continuous
state
of
alert
with
gunmen
ready
to
fire
on
people
who
casually
walked
up
to
ring
the

lets
try
that
again
why
was
the
batf
concerned
about
surprise
when
they
intended
to
serve
the
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
the
batf
appears
to
be
inconsistant
in
their
own
description
of
events
and
in
any
case
how
does
one
mount
an
ambush
if
one
isnt
on
alert
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
phill
the
batf
were
in
a
firefight
with
the
bd
for
fortyfive
minutes
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
they
were
expecting
peaceful
citizens
they
wouldnt
have
shown
up
in
livestock
trailers
and
would
have
retreated
immediately
not
a
smart
move
unless
meant
to
be
part
of
the

cover
even
so
the
narrow
opening
of
the
trucks
simply
was
not
a
good
idea
a
side
opening
truck
would
have
been
much
better
more
like
a
covered
waggon
so
were
the
batf
fired
on
before
or
after
they
left
the
trailers
to
knock
on
the
door
to
serve
the
warrant
every
description
ive
heard
indicates
the
batf
did
not
hang
around
in
the
trailers
once
they
decided
to
open
them
up
for
that
matter
if
they
expect
peaceful
citizens
why
come
in
live
stock
trailers
to
being
with
if
they
were
expecting
peacful
citizens
why
show
up
with
over
a
hundred
officers
some
of
which
clearly
visible

to
be
carrying

sounds
just
about
right
to
me
its
the

that
i

on

ok
just

you
consider

just

im

you
dont

anymore
weird
al
subject
re
law
and
economics
im
going
to
be
mixing
together
here
stuff
from
two
of
ted
franks
articles
which
was
a
response
to
me
and
a
response
to
tim
smith
yes
i
know
the
boomer
court
didnt
call
it
eminent
domain
but
if
it
walks
like
eminent
domain
and
swims
like
eminent
domain
and
quacks
like
eminent
domain
wdstarr
are
all
tort
cases
really
eminent
domain
cases
then
what
about
bankruptcy
contract
eminent
domain
is
a
statemandated
transaction
in
which
one
party
is
required
to
sell
a
piece
of
property
which
it
owns
to
another
party
regardless
of
whether
the
first
party
wishes
to
sell
at
all
at
a
price
which
is
set
by
the
state
i
fail
to
see
how
this
doctrine
can
be
found
in
tort
bankruptcy
or
contract
cases
in
general
well
okay
sort
of
in
bankruptcy
if
so
so
what
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
preventing
parties
from
reaping
windfall
settlements
from
other
parties
when
those
settlements
arise
from
wrongful
acts
by
those
other
parties
wdstarr
since
you
said
that
boomers
reliance
on
economics
led
to
an
unjust
result
im
pointing
out
that
your
alternative
is
far
more
unjust
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
world
atlantic
cements
act
was
not
wrongful
it
did
something
that
we
as
a
capitalistic
society
should
want
them
to
do
build
a
factory
create
industry
and
jobs
the
cost
of
compliance
was
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
damage
faced
by
plaintiffs
bang
heres
one
of
the
places
where
we
widely
diverge
you
believe
that
the
courts
in
deciding
a
civil
dispute
between
two
parties
should
consider
as
a
factor
perhaps
as
an
overriding
factor
issues
which
i
believe
the
court
should
ignore
as
being
irrelevant
to
the
dispute
boomer
v
atlantic
cement
co
was
an
action
brought
by
one
party
boomer
whose
property
rights
were
being
violated
on
an
ongoing
basis
by
another
party
the
atlantic
cement
company
the
facts
supported
boomers
contention
that
atlantic
cement
was
wrongfully
damaging
his
property
and
boomer
asked
the
court
to
order
atlantic
cement
to
stop
doing
so
end
of
story
there
was
no
reason
for
the
court
to
consider
such
issues
as
what
a
capitalistic
society
would
want
atlantic
cement
to
do
or
whether
the
cost
of
compliance
was
disproportionate
to
the
damage
faced
by
the
plaintiffs
those
issues
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
before
the
court
bill
if
the
government
had
stepped
in
and
the
epa
made
a
regulation
requiring
multimillion
dollar
cement
plants
to
be
shut
down
because
of
a
smattering
of
cement
dust
at
a
costbenefit
ratio
of
youd
be
up
in
arms
why
is
it
okay
for
the
judicial
branch
to
interfere
this
way
but
not
the
legislative
or
executive
branches
id
be
up
in
arms
why
do
you
assume
that
quite
the
contrary
id
probably
support
the
action
since
it
would
be
based
on
the
same
general
doctrine
as
the
decision
that
i
believe
would
have
been
correct
in
boomer
the
idea
that
peoples
property
rights
should
not
be
violated
for
reasons
of
economic
efficiency
in
boomer
it
was
boomers
property
rights
which
i
believe
the
court
should
have
protected
in
the
hypothetical
epa
ruling
youve
presented
its
the
american
peoples
collective
property
rights
in
a
healthy
physical
environment
what
good
is
costbenefit
ratio
of
if
you
wind
up
with
cement
dust
in
your
air
your
rule
makes
it
per
se
illegal
to
ever
operate
a
cement
plant
if
the
state
of
massachusetts
came
up
with
a
similar
regulation
youd
be
up
in
arms
and
complaining
about
interference
with
property
rights
and
fifth
amendment
violations
once
againwhy
is
it
okay
for
the
judicial
branch
to
interfere
this
way
but
not
the
legislative
or
executive
branches
or
are
you
not
the
libertarian
you
present
yourself
as
being
ted
frank
how
would
it
be
per
se
illegal
to
operate
a
cement
plant
wouldnt
it
just
mean
that
when
buying
land
for
a
cement
plant
you
would
have
to
either
buy
enough
land
so
that
most
of
the
pollution
would
stay
on
your
land
or
buy
pollution
easements
from
the
surrounding
landowners
tim
smith
all
it
takes
is
one
holdout
out
of
hundreds
of
neighbors
to
scrap
the
plant
furthermore
each
of
the
neighbors
is
going
to
want
the
full
benefit
of
the
bargain
under
the
resulting
bilateral
monopoly
a
bonanza
for
lawyers
to
be
sure
who
get
to
negotiate
each
of
these
agreements
a
windfall
for
homeowners
who
can
extort
away
any
profits
the
plant
would
make
but
not
particularly
good
for
society
yes
so
what
the
courts
are
supposed
to
protect
the
specific
rights
of
individuals
not
the
general
interests
of
some
nebulous
society
if
society
can
have
its
cement
plant
without
violating
anyones
rights
fine
otherwise
society
will
somehow
have
to
limp
along
with
one
less
cement
plant
see
ted
i
really
am
a
libertarian
after
all
thats
the
whole
point
behind
the
coase
theorem
in
a
world
without
transactions
costs
the
land
will
automatically
be
put
to
the
best
use
as
it
is
transferred
from
person
to
person
instantaneously
without
friction
the
legal
regime
will
not
matter
because
the
result
will
be
the
same
in
a
world
such
as
ours
one
with
transactions
costs
one
wants
the
legal
regime
to
approximate
the
end
result
to
begin
with
in
order
to
minimize
the
transactions
costs
one
wants
the
legal
regime
to
approximate
the
end
result
to
begin
with
in
order
to
minimize
the
transactions
costs
which
one
are
you
speaking
of
i
want
the
legal
regime
to
protect
peoples
rights
besides
coases
theorem
only
has
real
application
in
the
nevernever
land
of
perfectly
rational
actors
in
the
real
world
some
people
are
going
to
be
stubborn
ornery
spiteful
or
otherwise
irrational
from
a
economic
point
of
view
and
the
purpose
of
the
courts
is
to
protect
their
right
to
be
so
i
dont
care
if
you
can
show
me
logically
that
your
cattle
are
only
doing
of
damage
to
my
property
per
head
so
i
should
rationally
sell
you
grazing
rights
to
my
land
for
say
per
head
i
still
retain
the
right
to
tell
you
that
i
just
plain
dont
want
any
damned
cattle
on
my
property
not
at
any
price
and
then
you
say
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
as
above
i
dispute
your
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
deprived
of
their
rights
as
owners
of
property
to
choose
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
property
at
a
price
acceptable
to
them
wdstarr
then
by
your
argument
no
tort
plaintiff
is
ever
made
whole
because
the
award
of
damages
in
involuntary
why
should
we
treat
a
nuisance
plaintiff
any
different
than
any
other
tort
plaintiff
we
dont
require
specific
performance
in
the
analogous
contractual
situation
why
in
tort
last
question
first
for
the
same
reason
as
in
contract
law
because
to
do
so
would
come
dangerously
close
to
treading
on
the
thirteenth
amendment
as
to
your
then
by
your
argument
no
tort
plaintiff
is
ever
made
whole
because
the
award
of
damages
in
involuntary
claim
youre
at
least
partially
right
faced
with
situations
in
which
the
wrong
has
already
been
done
and
the
damage
to
the
victim
has
already
taken
place
and
cannot
be
reversed
or
undone
courts
will
try
to
set
an
equitable
price
tag
on
the
loss
suffered
by
the
victim
and
require
the
wrongdoer
to
pay
this
price
rather
than
an
inflated
price
which
the
victim
might
prefer
in
these
cases
the
sale
has
already
taken
place
and
is
irreversible
and
the
court
simply
tries
to
ensure
that
a
fair
price
is
paid
under
the
doctrines
that
a
only
in
certain
circumstances
should
even
a
civil
wrongdoer
be
forced
to
pay
punitive
or
excessive
prices
and
b
even
a
genuine
victim
should
not
profit
in
an
unjustified
or
inequitable
manner
from
his
victimhood
both
of
these
doctrines
may
be
worth
discussing
or
debating
elsewhere
but
neither
is
relevant
to
cases
like
boomer
in
which
the
wrongful
act
and
the
loss
stemming
from
it
are
still
in
the
future
and
can
be
reversedundone
ie
prevented
from
happening
at
all
by
order
of
the
court
in
these
types
of
cases
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
require
that
the
potential
victims
property
rights
are
protected
until
and
unless
he
agrees
to
sell
them
at
a
mutuallyacceptable
price
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
guess
at
the
equitable
value
of
the
loss
and
force
both
sides
to
accept
its
finding
it
can
leave
that
operation
up
to
the
parties
themselves
and
again
i
ask
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
avoided
if
so
ive
been
miseducated
i
always
thought
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
justice
is
done
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
unjust
because
they
are
punitive
in
cases
like
boomer
theyre
simply
a
cost
of
doing
business
the
fact
that
the
proprietors
of
the
atlantic
cement
co
got
themselves
into
a
position
in
which
they
found
themselves
over
this
barrel
is
simply
a
result
of
their
own
poor
business
decision
to
start
up
a
cement
plant
without
first
trying
to
negotiate
with
boomer
and
everyone
else
whose
property
rights
theyd
be
violating
via
the
operation
of
their
plant
theres
nothing
punitive
or
unjust
about
it
it
is
completely
sensible
only
if
you
believe
that
the
alleged
right
of
the
owners
of
atlantic
cement
to
stay
in

didnt

if
anything

he
had

wdstarr
in

he
cites
it
as
an
example
of
bilateral
monopoly
that
the
court
correctly
avoided
im
sure
its
covered
in

and
posner
book
on

presumably
favorably
but
i
dont
have
that
book
in
front
of
me
doesnt
sound
very
much
like
a
libertarian
to
me
libertarians
tend
to
believe
in
the
rights
of
individual
people
not
societies
ive
admitted
that
my
understanding
of
the
field
generally
referred
to
as
law
and
economics
is
weak
if
it
advocates
the
use
of
economical
analysis
as
one
of
many
tiebreaker
factors
which
courts
may
use
to
help
them
reach
decisions
in
cases
in
which
the
dispute
as
measured
by
the
scale
of
justice
is
evenly
balanced
fine
but
as
illustrated
by
boomer
it
is
not
fine
when
the
courts
start
viewing
the
economics
of
a
case
as
being
more
important
than
the
justice
of
a
case
wdstarr
in
this
case
the
justice
of
the
case
was
intricately
tied
up
with
the
economics
of
the
case
atlantic
cement
committed
a
tort
causing
of
damage
should
it
pay
in
the
millions
or
just
compensate
for
the
damage
it
committed
as
stated
above
the
tort
was
ongoing
atlantic
cement
wanted
to
be
able
to
continue
to
violate
boomers
rights
while
the
court
may
have
been
justified
in
setting
an
equitable
price
tag
on
the
damage
already
committed
it
had
no
reason
and
no
need
to
set
a
price
tag
on
the
future
violations
of
boomers
rights
and
to
then
force
boomer
to
sell
at
that
price

its

that
we

it

to

that
since

the

larger

oh
this

the

i
was

that
if

they

be
idiots
they
must
be
sheep
being

this

a

indeed
because
its
not

from
people

sheep
they
cant

themselves
to
people
are

and
need
firm

the

for

was
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
isnt
is
funny
how
someone
who
seems
to
know
nothing
about
homosexuality
uses
a
very
flawed
imho
source
of
information
to
pass
jusgement
on
all
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
it
would
seem
more
logical
to
say
that
since
the
heterosexual
group
of
men
is
larger
then
the
chances
of
promiscuity
larger
as
well
in
my
opinion
orientation
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
dont
understand
what
you
are
getting
at
here
if
the
chances
of
promiscuity
are
larger
yet
the
rate
of
promiscuity
is
lower
in
the
heterosexual
community
doesnt
that
imply
that
the
homobi
sexual
population
is
then
even
more
promiscuous
than
the
raw
statistics
imply
no
axe
to
grind
here
im
just
a
scientist
and
i
hate
to
see
statistics
abused
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the
same
man
before
that
i
was
a
virgin
i
am
a
hetero
man
and
have
had
sex
with
one
woman
in
my
life
my
wife
it
is
very
pleasing
to
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
hope
you
have
the
same
feeling
as
i
do
i
also
wish
that
you
could
if
you
wanted
experience
the
joys
and
trials
of
being
committed
to
someone
for
life
there
is
something
about
marriage
that
makes
the
commitment
much
greater
than
one
might
expect
so
whose
promiscuous
just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt
mean
they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is
heterosexual
doesnt
mean
they
do
look
at
the
world
statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by
default
hetero
dont
forget
about
the
culture
sadly
we
dont
as
a
society
look
upon
homosexuality
as
normal
and
as
we
are
all
too
well
aware
there
are
alot
of
people
who
condemn
it
as
a
result
the
gay
population
is
not
encouraged
to
develop
nonpromiscuous
relationships
in
fact
there
are
many
roadblocks
put
in
the
way
of
such
committed
relationships
it
is
as
if
the
heterosexual
community
puts
these
blocks
there
so
as
to
perpetuate
the
claim
that
gays
are
immoral
my
if
we
allowed
gays
to
marry
raise
children
we
might
just
find
out
theyre
as
moral
as
we
are

a

from

itll
have

im

about

really

this

does
nothing
to
justify
the

if
anything
it
demonstrates
that
the

is
a

failure
what
it
demonstrates
is
that
people
will
take

if
they

perhaps
if

he

hes
in

i
do
agree
with
you
in
a
way
the
war
on

has
failed
but
in
my
opinion
that
doesnt
mean
we
have
to
give
up
only
change
the
tactics
for
instance
here
are
how
some
penalties
should
be
changed
dealing
coke
death
dealing
heroin
death
dealing
pot
death
dealing
crack
death
the
list
goes
on
and
on
just
kidding
however
on
a
more
serious
note
i
do
believe
that
we
should
take
some
money
away
from
the
foriegn
operations
in
south
america
and
costly
border
interdiction
efforts
dont
think
im
going
to
say
spend
it
to
educate
people
because
i
know
plenty
of
educated
dopers
actually
spend
it
on
things
like
drug
treatment
programs
i
saw
an
interesting
story
on
minutes
about
how
the
british
actually
prescribe
and
addict
his
recommended
dosage
and
try
to
ween
him
off
from
it
or
cut
the
amount
down
to
levels
where
it
is
acceptable
sounds
good
so
far
from
what
i
heard
with
a
decrease
in
cost
lower
addiction
rates
by
wiping
out
the
dealers
markets
etc
but
that
was
the
only
thing
i
have
heard
about
it
however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
plus
i
have
never
heard
of

does

does

with

also
the

that
would

as
for

i
wonder
how
much
the

is
going
to
inflate
the
numbers
this
time
last
time
for
the

they
more
than
doubled
the

number
of
people
who
showed
up

and
all
the

coming

how
the

slants
the

really
makes
one
wonder
whos
watching
the
watchers
why
are
you
all
playing
these
pathetic
number
games
the
number
of
people
showing
up
at
the

hardly
constitutes
the
entire
queer
populace
i
doubt
that
it
constitutes
more
than
a
handful
of
us
im
queer
and
i
wont
be
there
simply
because
i
dont
have

what
the

makes
you
think
the

embody
more

there

hell
some

the
best
way
to
deal
with

is
not
to
fear
it

blind
yourself
to
it

to
realize
that
you
have

by

president
clinton
already
started
passing
the
buck
by
saying
talk
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
fbi
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
done
but
the
decision
was
it
entirely
theirs
it
they
made
the
tactical
decision
enter
attorney
general
janet
reno
after
most
of
the
branch
davidians
died
reno
said
she
took
full
responsibility
for
the
decision
i
approved
the
plan
she
said
adding
that
she
did
not
advise
him
clinton
as
to
the
details
in
fact
she
told
clinton
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
go
as
the
fire
was
roaring
through
the
branch
davidians
compound
clinton
said
that
he
was
deeply
sadened
by
the
loss
of
life
and
in
the
same
breath
that
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
in
the
waco
siege
recommended
the
course
of
action
pursued
today
later
he
went
on
to
say
i
stand
by
that
renos
decision
how
did
this
all
begin
at
on
february
agents
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
batf
launched
a
fullscale
highprofile
assault
on
the
branch
davidians
compound
this
raid
was
much
more
than
an
assault
on
a
group
suspected
of
possessing
illegal
weapons
the
assault
was
a
planned
media
circus
used
as
a
propaganda
device
of
the
batf
to
show
their
might
and
just
purpose
at
the
onset
of
the
noknock
raid
gaggles
of
heavily
armed
batf
agents
made
their
way
inside
the
compound
without
identifying
themselves
or
state
that
they
had
a
warrant
until
long
after
the
shooting
began
silently
the
agents
made
their
way
to
the
compounds
buildings
and
started
their
search
by
charging
at
the
buildings
and
throwing
concussion
grenades
and
ordering
the
cult
members
to
come
out
of
the
buildings
if
unknown
persons
dressed
in
black
ninja
costumes
and
combat
fatigues
were
to
attack
you
throwing
grenades
and
brandishing
firearms
would
you
not
assume
that
these
people
are
criminals
and
attempt
to
defend
yourself
the
tactics
employed
by
the
batf
provoked
the
battle
the
initial
assualt
by
the
batf
was
not
successful
unfortunately
lives
were
lost
on
both
sides
but
had
the
assault
been
a
success
the
liberal
media
would
have
praised
the
batf
by
showing
the
footage
of
batf
agents
carting
away
a
bunch
of
gunwielding
religious
nuts
of
course
any
violation
of
the
cults
rights
would
have
been
overlooked
and
the
media
would
proclaim
americas
fortune
in
having
supercop
organizations
like
the
batf
that
can
systematically
take
out
terroristic
groups
such
as
the
branch
davidians
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
batf
and
the
fbi
dropped
the
ball
just
like
philadelphia
did
in
the
move
crisis
which
left
dead
homeless
and
a
city
block
razed
it
appears
that
the
batf
has
adopted
the
shootfirst
tactic
of
noknock
raids
to
execute
search
warrants
dont
let
the
batf
convince
you
that
the
noknock
raid
was
justified
noknock
assaults
make
sense
when
looking
for
say
drugs
that
can
easily
be
hidden
or
disposed
of
in
a
few
seconds
the
batf
was
looking
for
illegal
weapons
not
drugs
that
could
be
hidden
or
flushed
down
the
toilet
in
a
matter
of
a
few
seconds
what
ever
happened
to
this
is
the
police
you
are
surrounded
it
this
policy
of
noknock
raids
by
federal
and
local
agencies
should
be
restricted
further
the
use
of
military
firepower
against
presumed
innocent
citizens
is
a
very
scary
idea
and
is
why
the
davidians
were
justified
in
using
lethal
force
to
ensure
that
their
fourth
ammendment
rights
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
houses
papers
and

now
which
is
it
are
you
going
to
comdemn
national
media
then
turn
around
and
use
it
to
support
some
position
you
present
seems
somewhat
contradictory
doesnt
it
i
believe
that
this
is
not
contradictory
on
the
basis
that
the
quality
of
media
reporting
varies
greatly
based
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
media
has
proven
itself
very
accurate
is
the
areas
of
presenting
raw
undisputed
data
one
good
example
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatures
of
the
previous
day
for
a
large
number
of
locations
are
posting
there
is
little
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
i
believe
this
true
when
we
speak
of
physical
data
in
the
sense
of
pure
science
but
when
we
speak
of
data
that
revolve
around
social
sciences
then
we
have
to
be
careful
the
american
media
has
failed
us
in
its
analysis
of
complex
events
however
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
many
news
stories
that
have
left
us
angry
because
so
many
facts
have
been
ommitted
cases
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invasion
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disaster
in
waco
the
issues
surrounding
the
acceptance
of
gays
into
the
military
the
war
on
drugs
and
many
others
i
quite
agree
but
these
are
cases
or
news
events
that
contain
politics
social
science
information
sociology
etc
and
at
best
are
reflections
of
the
group
that
reports
them
as
you
have
pointed
out
it
is
difficult
to
report
that
the
temperature
was
degrees
when
it
was
degrees
and
have
people
believe
you
the
story
that
you
bring
to
light
was
regarding
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazyness
some
of
the
data
was
ommitted
from
the
article
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
the
data
that
was
presented
did
not
deviate
from
the
survey
i
do
however
think
that
it
would
be
folly
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
single
newswriters
analysis
of
this
data
in
this
particular
case
there
was
little
analysis
and
the
reader
was
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convictions
yes
and
no
the
survey
presented
according
to
mr
cramer
a
value
called
the
median
which
one
used
this
makes
us
believe
that
of
the
males
had
plus
sex
partners
and
of
the
males
had
or
less
sex
partners
homosexuals
are
purported
to
make
up
only
in
this
case
the
majority
of
people
with
plus
sex
partners
are
heterosexual
it
is
my
feeling
that
median
was
not
the
intended
word
usage
but
if
it
is
then
we
have
little
evidence
to
support
mr
cramer
claims
about
gay
promiscuity
hetero
promiscuity
many
netters
mr
cramer
included
often
forget
that
the
american
media
are
merely
a
number
of
businesses
whos
purpose
in
life
is
to
make
money
for
their
owners
and
stockholders
revenues
come
largely
from
advertisers
who
merely
want
maximum
useful
exposure
per
dollar
the
media
is
like
fast
food
the
quality
of
the
food
or
of
the
reporting
will
improve
only
if
the
customers
demand
as
such
otherwise
it
is
business
as
usual
very
good
this
is
a
point
that
i
have
tried
to
bring
out
and
as
any
network
news
program
will
show
you
it
is
true
the
news
media
is
a
business
and
as
such
becomes
skewed
because
of
where
its
loyalties
lie
there
is
an
old
statement
by
a
man
and
i
cannot
remember
him
or
his
statment
exactly
but
it
warns
against
the
merger
of
business
and
news
reporting
because
of
the
obvious
consequences

william

starr
note
this
is
a
repost
of
my
earlier
response
to
mr
starr
which
was
not
properly
formatted
apologies
to
those
whove
seen
the
following
before
to
explain
my
position
on
the
war
on
drugs
i
offer
this
drugs
and
crime
a
new
approach
by
ken
barnes
given
that
the
trade
in
illegal
drugs
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
which
afflicts
our
nation
people
who
want
drugs
particularly
people
who
are
predisposed
to
addiction
will
find
a
way
to
get
them
whether
or
not
they
are
legally
available
despite
current
law
enforcement
efforts
drugs
are
readily
available
to
those
who
want
them
addiction
to
drugs
both
legal
and
illegal
is
responsible
for
a
significant
drain
on
the
productive
resources
of
our
country
and
this
occurs
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
the
cocaineaddicted
babies
who
are
unable
to
learn
to
the
spread
of
disease
among
addicts
to
the
tragic
consequences
of
alcohol
abuse
and
tobacco
smoking
a
general
economic
principle
of
government
is
that
whatever
is
subsidized
you
get
more
of
and
whatever
is
taxed
you
get
less
of
to
be
most
effective
in
confronting
the
nations
drug
problem
some
way
must
be
found
to
utilize
these
additional
powers
of
government
to
make
drug
dealing
and
drug
use
less
attractive
while
this
countrys
current
efforts
to
combat
legal
drugs
have
succeeded
in
some
respects
there
is
a
greater
awareness
of
the
health
consequences
of
smoking
and
designateddriver
programs
have
helped
reduce
drunk
driving
for
example
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
war
on
illegal
drugs
there
remains
a
core
group
of
illegal
drug
users
which
support
international
networks
of
smugglers
pushers
growers
processors
kingpins
and
gangsters
these
networks
and
their
marketing
activities
which
include
drive
by
shootings
corrupting
law
enforcement
authorities
and
smuggling
weapons
are
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
crimes
committed
in
our
country
every
day
clearly
illegal
drugs
and
rising
crime
are
linked
it
takes
only
a
moments
reflection
to
recognize
how
they
are
linked
the
link
is
money
as
with
this
countrys
failed
effort
to
prohibit
alcohol
consumption
a
black
market
has
been
created
in
which
greedy
local
monopolies
like
the
gangsters
of
a
bygone
era
have
profited
enormously
from
their
illegal
trade
the
victims
of
this
trade
include
not
only
the
innocent
people
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
in
the
crossfire
but
i
would
argue
the
drug
users
themselves
were
it
not
for
the
black
market
and
the
violent
monopoly
of
the
drug
lords
drug
users
might
not
be
the
thieves
robbers
prostitutes
and
murderers
they
have
become
in
order
to
pay
the
high
prices
the
drug
lords
demand
in
the
absence
of
the
drug
lords
most
would
be
i
believe
simply
people
with
a
problem
either
a
moral
problemora
medical
problem
butnota
criminal
problem
let
me
be
clear
however
i
amnotadvocating
that
we
let
the
criminals
who
have
been
preying
on
our
society
for
these
many
years
of
prohibition
off
the
hook
on
the
contrary
the
new
approach
i
advocate
is
one
which
would
not
result
in
either
the
government
or
private
industry
getting
into
the
business
of
promoting
crack
cocaine
or
any
other
presently
illegal
drug
for
that
matter
neither
is
it
an
approach
which
sees
law
abiding
citizens
handing
over
more
and
more
of
their
freedom
and
privacy
in
an
effort
to
track
down
illegal
drug
users
until
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
looks
like
a
police
state
here
then
is
my
proposal
possession
and
use
of
all
presently
illegal
drugs
is
decriminalized
but
buying
and
selling
them
remains
illegal
potheads
can
grow
their
own
marijuana
as
many
already
do
today
other
drug
users
can
legally
import
their
poison
of
choice
as
long
as
they
pay
the
tariffs
and
a
barter
economy
of
drug
experimenters
develops
because
of
the
barter
economy
which
supplies
the
drug
users
the
black
market
profits
that
have
so
enriched
the
drug
lords
dwindle
if
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
why
buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommercial
drugs
even
at
relatively
low
prices
therefore
law
enforcement
activity
is
concentrated
on
those
individuals
who
continue
to
buy
and
sell
and
also
on
the
crimes
committed
by
drug
users
too
poor
to
afford
even
low
prices
but
here
is
where
the
strategy
begins
to
differentiate
between
the
drug
dealers
the
victimizers
and
the
drug
users
their
victims
upon
arrest
foranycrimesuspects
are
permitted
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
will
undergo
a
drug
test
those
who
choose
to
cooperate
are
informed
that
upon
conviction
for
the
crime
they
are
accused
of
if
they
are
found
to
be
a
drug
user
they
will
be
institutionalized
until
they
are
clean
and
only
then
will
they
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
if
they
choose
to
cooperate
and
are
already
drugfree
they
can
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
right
away
those
who
choose
not
to
undergo
the
drug
test
and
are
convicted
face
stiffer
fines
and
serve
longer
sentences
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
serves
several
purposes
drug
using
criminals
and
this
includes
drunk
andor
stoned
drivers
are
separated
from
their
sources
of
supply
thus
reducing
the
total
number
of
drug
users
in
society
at
large
and
consequently
decreasing
the
demand
for
drugs
on
the
street
putting
more
of
the
remaining
drug
dealers
out
of
business
institutionalization
provides
an
incentive
for
drug
using
criminals
to
straighten
themselves
out
before
becoming
part
of
the
general
prison
population
while
helping
protect
society
from
crime
institutionalization
could
also
serve
to
deter
drug
users
from
becoming
criminals
since
drug
using
criminals
unlike
other
criminals
would
be
delayed
prior
to
serving
their
sentences
by
the
additional
time
it
takes
for
them
to
sober
up
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
separate
from
the
general
prison
population
would
also
provide
a
closely
monitored
pool
of
addicts
who
could
volunteer
for
research
studies
of
new
techniques
and
treatments
for
addictive
disease
with
the
potential
to
benefit
both
themselves
and
others
dealers
in
illegal
drugs
are
generally
not
drug
users
themselves
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
drug
bosses
or
kingpins
running
large
illicit
organizations
under
this
proposal
dealers
would
be
more
readily
identifiable
since
upon
arrest
they
would
presumably
pass
the
drug
test
or
else
decline
to
take
it
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
explain
why
they
are
in
possession
of
drugs
when
it
is
apparent
they
do
not
use
them
declining
to
take
the
test
they
would
of
course
face
stiffer
penalties
while
each
case
of
attempted
sale
of
a
noncommercial
drug
would
have
to
stand
on
own
its
merits
the
outcome
of
a
suspects
drug
test
could
provide
additional
evidence
for
the
prosecution
just
as
cigarette
taxes
have
contributed
to
the
decline
of
smoking
in
our
country
by
making
cigarettes
more
costly
while
at
the
same
time
providing
revenue
for
antismoking
campaigns
noncommercial
drugs
should
be
taxed
and
the
money
generated
should
be
used
to
combat
their
use
enforcement
of
this
tax
should
be
on
a
voluntary
basis
however
and
should
not
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
infringe
on
the
rights
and
privacy
of
noncommercial
drug
users
since
to
do
so
would
have
the
effect
of
reintroducing
prohibition
instead
drug
users
will
be
encouraged
to
pay
the
tax
by
reminding
them
that
if
untaxed
drugs
are
ever
found
in
their
possession
during
the
course
of
routine
police
operations
they
will
be
required
to
pay
the
tax
immediately
or
else
forfeit
their
untaxed
drugs
to
be
destroyed
if
drug
dealers
are
found
to
be
selling
noncommercial
drugs
on
which
taxes
have
not
been
paid
they
will
face
additional
prosecution
for
evading
the
tax
the
strategy
of
adding
tax
evasion
to
drug
dealing
charges
is
already
in
use
in
some
jurisdictions
but
its
effectiveness
is
currently
limited
by
the
illegality
of
drug
possession
revenue
from
drug
possession
taxes
and
import
tariffs
would
be
used
to
fund
antidrug
advertising
campaigns
and
provide
support
to
private
sector
drug
treatment
programs
for
those
unable
to
afford
treatment
taxpayer
subsidies
to
all
drug
producers
must
be
ended
federal
support
of
tobacco
farming
is
both
immoral
and
wasteful
in
this
era
of
tight
budgets
and
the
marijuana
crops
grown
illicitly
on
federal
lands
in
many
states
must
likewise
be
eliminated
while
my
proposal
would
have
the
effect
of
permitting
the
use
of
what
are
now
illegal
drugs
it
would
hold
the
users
of
all
drugs
responsible
for
their
actions
and
i
believe
would
reduce
the
harm
drugs
have
on
our
society
particularly
the
crime
caused
by
the
illegal
drug
trade
so
long
as
we
remain
a
free
nation
with
relatively
porous
borders
and
freedom
for
our
citizens
to
travel
we
will
always
have
a
drug
problem
whether
it
takes
the
form
of
heroin
addicts
dying
in
abandoned
buildings
drunk
drivers
killing
and
maiming
others
on
our
streets
or
emphysema
patients
struggling
for
breath
after
a
lifetime
of
smoking
the
results
are
the
same
needless
suffering
and
death
as
a
society
we
must
recognize
that
while
our
society
permits
us
to
harm
ourselves
with
drugs
as
we
are
already
doing
regardless
of
the
drug
laws
we
must
take
a
stand
against
the
harm
that
drugs
and
drug
users
cause
to
others
we
must
particularly
oppose
the
vicious
and
violent
cartels
which
prey
on
the
weakness
of
drug
users
by
taking
the
profits
out
of
their
deadly
trade
my
proposal
goes
a
long
way
towards
shutting
down
these
powerful
criminal
organizations
the
question
of
whether
drug
use
is
a
moral
or
medical
problem
depends
on
which
group
of
drug
users
youre
talking
about
different
drugs
have
different
effects
and
some
are
more
addictive
than
others
the
addictiveness
of
a
drug
also
often
varies
between
individuals
and
so
we
have
some
people
who
can
drink
alcohol
in
moderation
while
others
find
they
cannot
resist
the
bottle
nicotine
which
former
surgeon
general
c
everett
koop
declared
to
be
as
addicting
as
heroin
is
a
legal
drug
with
known
harmful
effects
and
while
some
people
can
stop
smoking
by
willpower
alone
others
continue
to
smoke
even
after
treatment
for
lung
cancer
for
those
individuals
who
can
stop
taking
drugs
on
their
own
we
may
argue
that
because
they
have
chosen
to
use
them
this
represents
a
moral
failure
on
their
part
or
an
unwillingness
to
face
the
difficulties
of
life
but
for
the
addicts
while
they
may
have
chosen
to
use
drugs
the
first
time
by
the
time
they
discover
their
addiction
it
is
too
late
we
cannot
hold
them
responsible
for
their
disease
any
more
than
we
would
blame
someone
who
is
drowning
for
an
inability
to
swim
perhaps
they
should
have
known
not
to
go
near
the
water
or
perhaps
someone
should
have
warned
them
of
the
danger
but
in
their
present
circumstances
warnings
will
not
help
neither
does
it
help
for
the
drug
dealers
on
the
shore
to
be
tossing
them
weights

a

from

in

responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in

and

in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
that
study
which
was
in
the
nejm
i
think
noted
that
the
frequency
of
heart
surgery
on
patients
over
seventy
increase
with

in

i
guess
richer
people
have
more
heart
disease
in
california
whereas
the
frequency
of
surgery
on
patients
over

in

was
relatively
uniform
across

heart
surgery
was
more
frequent
in

mortality
and
outcomes
were
essentially
the
same
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that

rationed

the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his

said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital

as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the

why

thats
none

its

whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
the
only
potential
problem
i
see
with
the
private
mri
facilty
in
calgary
is
the
selfreferral
problem
to
the
facility
for
the
doctors
who
have
a
financial
interest
in
it
which
is
basically
unethicalbut
in
canada
because
of
our
small
population
there
is
likely
only
to
be
a
few
private
facilities
involving
only
a
small
number
of
doctors
and
thus
i
dont
think
the
selfreferral
problem
which
is
an
epidemic
in
the
us
could
ever
get
out
of
hand
here
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
it
is
an
experiment
that
will
be
certainly
be
watched
carefully
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying
on
mri
unfortunately
ive
had
a
few
and
im
not
a
banker
what
likely
happened
is
the
sponsors
of
the
private
mri
which
include
doctors
anticipated
that
alberta
would
need
more
mris
and
instead
of
waiting
for
the
health
planners
to
realize
they
needed
another

they
would

kennejsacsokstateedu
kennedy
james
scot
writes
recent
studies
have
shown
that
the
number
of
men
who
have
engaged
in
homosexual
activities
in
the
last
decade
is
and
the
number
of
men
who
are
exclusively
homosexual
is
these
figures
are
much
less
than
those
that
came
from
earlier
studies
that
showed
that
homosexuality
among
men
is
a
lot
higher
so
what
can
we
deduce
from
these
figures
are
there
a
lot
less
male
homosexuals
than
there
used
to
be
or
are
men
perhaps
women
too
not
as
honest
as
they
used
to
be
about
there
sexuality
presumably
the
people
that
were
polled
in
you
mean
in
the
men
and
women
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexuality
than
today
want
to
try
that
one
again
this
survey
were
assured
of
their
anonymnity
so
they
should
have
answered
the
questions
honestly
i
suppose
however
it
could
be
that
gays
feel
so
repressed
and
denigrated
by
society
that
they
didnt
feel
that
they
could
be
forthcoming
about
there
sexuality
in
something
like
a
survey
if
this
true
then
is
it
possible
that
there
is
a
lot
more
gays
out
there
than
we
are
led
to
believe
perhaps
if
americans
were
more
open
about
there
sexualityi
think
most
americans
arentthen
we
might
discover
that
there
are
really
quite
a
few
more
people
out
there
who
are
orientated
toward
the
same
sexmen
and
women
included
id
venture
a
guess
that
there
is
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
have
considered
having
a
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex
at
some
point
in
there
life
maybe
they
didnt
take
their
longings
seriously
but
this
doesnt
make
these
longings
any
less
valid
therefore
if
americans
werent
so
repressed
about
their
sexuality
in
generalas
i
believe
they
may
be
then
wed
see
a
lot
more
people
coming
out
of
the
closet
you
mean
ignore
study
after
study
so
that
we
can
continue
to
accept
a
study
kinseys
that
is
obviously
wrong
as
for
myself
im
a
heterosexual
and
ive
never
considered
having
sex
with
another
man
thats
just
the
way
i
ami
could
have
just
as
easily
of
been
gay
i
suppose
one
of
the
big
debates
about
homosexuality
is
whether
or
not
its
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learned
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
its
some
combination
of
the
two
based
on
what
besides
your
own
warm
fuzzy
feelings
heres
something
to
ponder
upon
have
any
of
you
gaybashers
out
there
ever
considered
that
homosexuals
probably
deem
their
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
just
as
much
an
intrinsic
and
natural
part
of
their
life
as
heterosexuals
do
about
their
own
sexuality
in
other
words
someone
who
is
truly
alcoholics
share
that
feeling
until
they
hit
bottom
gay
may
not
be
able
to
live
any
other
way
even
if
they
date
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
or
get
married
in
their
heart
they
are
still

suggest
if

antidiscrimination
laws

until
they
get
over

is
to
tell

people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice

to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative

months

lets
take
it
one
step
further
even
if
as
the
surveys
show
up
to
of
all
men
have
had
a
homosexual
encounter
then
there
must
cite
a
survey
other
than
the
obviously
bogus
kinsey
studies
be
an
even
larger
percentage
of
people
who
have
had
homosexual
erotic
fantasies
but
if
less
than
of
the
population
is
gay
what
can
we
say
about
these
people
who
dont
identify
as
gay
but
have
demonstrated
gay
potential
obviously
a
large
chunk
of
these
people
chose
or
more
accurately
were
forced
to
choose
by
force
of
religion
and
social
sanction
to
put
those
feelings
aside
to
be

obviously

fall

the
most
thorough
examination
of

mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four

right
off

this

is
flawed
most
throrough
im
sorry
but
masters
johnson
put
out
a
report
within
the
past
few
years
the
kinsey
institute
has
been
quite
active
since
it
was
founded
ohsomany
years
ago
they
too
recently
put
out
a
new
report
on
sexuality
i
was
quoting
a
news
story
i
have
no
idea
why
they
claim
this
was
the
most
through
examination
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
i
hate
to
be
picky
but
lets
do
the
math
if
we
take
the
cities
of
new
york
city
and
los
angeles
alone
we
can
find
approximately
million
gay
peoplemaking
about
million
gay
men
what
even
in
san
francisco
the
dept
of
public
health
estimates
that
only
of
the
male
population
is
gay
what
you
are
claiming
is
that
of
the
million
people
in
the
nyc
and
la
areas
that
more
than
are
gay
what
is
the
source
of
your
numbers
keep
in
mind
that
attempts
by
cdc
to
determine
homosexual
percentage
in
american
cities
have
given
numbers
of
the
american
male
population
is
about
million
so
what
this
study
says
is
that
all
gay
males
live
in
new
york
city
or
los
angeles
and
about
halfamillion
people
are
lying
about
being
gay
something
smells
funny

to

you

lets
keep

so
hard
to
think
of
a
better
system
than
we
have
all
you
have
to
do
is
realize
that
the
system
we
have
now
is
not
sacrosanct
in
fact
its
a
rigged
game
that
steals
you
blind
and
is
the
most
unfair
any
system
could
be
already
the
trick
is
to
realize
that
the
old
rich
have
been
making
the
rules
behind
your
back
and
that
its
time
to
kick
them
off
the
merrygoround
tax
the
rich
to
death
they
are
the
ones
that
converted
your
school
lunch
program
into
the
joke
it
is
today
they
are
the
ones
who
always
cut
education
they
are
the
ones
who
always
raise
the
rent
when
you
get
a
raise
they
are
the
ones
who
should
be
not
just
dislodged
but
killed
for
their
abuse
i
have
trouble
justifying
the
death
penalty
for
a
poor
kid
who
killed
and
didnt
know
why
not
i
have
no
trouble
justifying
the
death
penalty
for
the
rich
who
steal
countless
human
lives
to
feed
their
greed
have
you
paid
rent
most
of
your
life
then
you
have
been
enslaved
percentage
wise
most
of
your
life
we
used
to
be
serfs
now
we
are
called
renters
and
we
are
still
enslaved
to
somebody
who
claims
to
own
land
they
dont
use
and
make
us
pay
them
for
it
when
they
did
nothing
to
own
it
most
rents
in
california
are
enough
to
buy
the
apartment
house
paynthe
taxes
and
the
insurance
and
have
a
little
left
over
to
travel
with
i
have
seen
the
books
i
know
what
my
landlord
pays
and
to
whom
i
know
what
i
pay
her
i
am
being
forced
to
buy
her
a
building
and
then
i
will
be
let
out
at
the
other
end
with
nothing
when
i
had
as
much
right
as
her
to
live
on
this
planet
and
her
child
will
have
the
money
to
likewise
enslave
my
child
i
hope
i
find
out
when
i
am
going
to
die
i
can
make
things
just
a
little
happier
form
me
to
be
able
to
destroy
her
life
as
she
destroyed
mine
and
maybe
i
can
take
a
few
other
landlords
with
me
and
their
heirs
that
would
be
worth
it
then
to
be
able
to
die
before
they
can
do
anything
to
me
thats
a
poor
mans
dream
sleep
tight
bastard
landlords
you
dont
know
the
trouble
you
are
buying
yourself
as
you
sleep

there
is
a
big
difference
between
running

actively

and
charging
homosexuals
more
becuase
people
think
that
aids
is
a
gay
disease
is
actively
ripping
people

really
i
thought
that
insurance
companies
hired
all
of
their
actuarial
staffs
to
determine
the
risks
correlated
with
all
groups

people
and
that
gays
are
more

than
are
those

if
i
am
wrong
about
this
correlation
please
correct

my

charges
me
up

always

rather

of

with

we

by

far
out
on

of

there
is
a

of
prochastity
researchers

the

alfred

was
a

what
really
riles
these

kinseys

reisman
accused
kinsey

inolved
in
the
vicious
genital
torture
of
hundreds
of
children
she
speculated
that

kidnapped
and
drugged

in

to
carry
out
clandestine
orgasm
tests
now
seven
years
later
reisman
has
revived
her
charges
in
a
different
book
titled
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
just
released
by
the
small
and
religiously
oriented
huntington
house
in
lafayette
louisiana
her
coauthor
is
ed
eichel
a
manhattan
psychotherapist
who
has
invented
a
new
style
of
intromission
the
coital
alignment
technique
that
supposedly
triggers
simultaneous
orgasm
with
considerable
regularity
and
thereby
increases
compatibilty
between
the
sexes
in
the
book
eichel
contends
that
kinsey
deliberately
cooked
the
gay
stats
because
being
an
oddball
himself
he
wanted
to
advance
the
denormalization
of
heterosexuality
if
the
authors
are
right
then
the
world
famous
kinsey
reports
are
as
the
introduction
boldly
asserts
the
most
egregious
example
of
scientific
deception
in
this
century
and
if
they
are
wrong
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
is
a
shameful
smear
despite
the
less
than
stellar
credentials
of

way
or

so
it
should
not
surprise
anybody
that
kinsey
who
filmed
strange
people
having
sex
in
his
attic
may
have
had
skeletons
in
the
closet
the
problem
is
that

not

have
the

prowess
to
pull
off
the

in

before
the

carried
this
admission
that

around

notwithstanding
the
sixfigure
humiliation
reisman
went
on
to
scratch
out
a
niche
on
the
ioony
right
as
the
darling
of
the
sex
cranks
she
deplores
subversive
phenomena
like

in

and
blames

kinsey

is
reismans
latest
grasp
for
respectability
pat
buchanan
of
course
is
putting
his
krugerrands
on
reismans
ultimate
vindication
this
book
is
social
dynamite
he
says
in
a
blurb
an
the
front
cover
he
especially
liked
the
antigay
parts
smacking
his
lips
in
his
syndicated
column
he
declared
it
may
just
blow
the
sewer
cap
off
kinseys
monumental
reputation
reestablish
homosexuality
as
a
aberration
expose
the
gay
rights
movement
as
a
paper
tiger
and
even
put
at
risk
the
enormous
sex
industry
built
upon
dr
kinseys
research
the
blockbuster
charge
at
the
heart
of
the
cluttered
and
repetilive
jaccuse
is
that
kinsey
was
a
sexmad
pedophile
who
molested
little
boys
in
nazitype
experiments
and
recorded
their
orgasms
in
his
male
volume
a
similar
charge
was
first
recited
at
the
fifth
world
conference
on
sexology
in
jerusalem
in
to
no
effect
before
being
recycled
by
reisman
for
buchanan
in
washington
in
here
is
how
reisman
and
eichel
repackaged
the
mengele
business
in
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
mengelelike
scientific
experiments
on
infants
and
children
were
the
basis
for
kinseys
conclusions
on
childhood
sexuality
somewhere
and
sometime
in
the
course
of
the
project
kinsey
appears
to
have
directed
experimental
sex
research
on
several
hundred
children
aged
from
two
months
to
almost
years
this
of
course
would
implicate
kinsey
and
his
team
in
promoting
and
perhaps
participating
in
the
criminal
activity
in
the
opinion
of
this
books
authors
that
is
exactly
how
part
of
kinseys
child
sexuality
research
took
place
donning
his
psychohistorians
cap
and
citing
an
fbi
manual
on
child
molesters
as
a
guide
eichel
casually
diagnoses
kinsey
as
a
homosexual
pedophile
with
the
perfect
motive
for
doing
exactly
as
reisman
said
kinsey
placed
himself
in
professional
and
nonprofessional
positions
where
he
had
access
to
young
boys
such
as
ymca
camp
counselor
boys
club
leader
and
boy
scout
leader
activities
he
kept
up
during
his
college
and
graduate
yeaers
and
even
after
his
marriage
as
crude
as
his
analysis
seems
eichel
was
more
than
happy
to
elaborate
even
further
in
a
recent
phone
interview
if
youve
ever
been
around
boy
lovers
pedophiles
they
are
absolutely
compulsive
he
averred
everything
in
his
life
is
directed
at
getting
children
i
didnt
mention
this
in
our
book
but
the
caption
under
kinseys
high
school
picture
was
a
quote
from
hamlet
man
delights
me
not
no
sic
nor
woman
neither
what
do
you
think
they
were
picking
up
on
before
weighing
what
reisman
and
eichel
pass
off
as
proof
of
kinseys
sex
crimes
something
must
be
said
about
kinseys
scientific
modus
operandi
he
was
a
fiendish
collector
as
a
young
zoologist
with
a
dsc
from
harvard
he
collected
million
gall
wasps
and
million
related
insects
when
he
switched
to
sex
exploration
after
agreeing
to
teach
a
marriage
course
at
indiana
university
in
he
was
no
less
curious
or
acquisitive
nothing
that
mammals
did
in
the
realm
of
reproduction
was
foreign
to
him
he
compiled
masses
of
erotic
materials
including
toilet
wall
inscriptions
from
male
and
female
johns
that
highlighted
differences
in
sexual
psychology
and
flms
of
mating
in
species
of
animals
that
showed
an
amazing
similarity
in
oral
eroticism
naturally
the
sexual
response
of
children
the
genesis
of
eros
fascinated
him
it
was
impossible
to
understand
the
sexual
behaviors
of
adults
without
examining
their
origins
and
so
with
the
fervor
of
his
bughunting
days
kinsey
collected
information
about
kids
though
even
his
worst
enemies
until
reisman
and
eichel
refrained
from
linking
him
personally
to
his
data
on
preadolescent
sex
kinsey
said
plainly
in
the
male
volume
that
he
got
information
on
the
sex
life
of
young
boys
from
people
who
had
sex
with
them
some
of
these
adults
are
technically
trained
persons
who
have
kept
diaries
or
other
records
which
have
been
put
at
our
disposal
although
he
gathered
much
boyhood
data
from
the
memories
of
his
subjects
and
the
observations
of
parents
and
nursery
school
teachers
he
treated
the
documentary
materia
of
the
pedophiles
as
pure
gold
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
the
literature
kinseys
main
source
a
govemment
worker
was
also
the
most
unforgettable
character
he
had
ever
met
this
man
whose
history
took
hours
to
log
had
sex
with
over
boys
and
girls
as
well
as
of
family
members
including
his
father
and
grandmother
a
sexual
hobbyist
and
passionate
recordkeeper
he
gave
kinsey
detailed
accounts
of
orgasms
that
he
observed
in
preadolescent
boys
relying
on
the
mans
meticulous
research
which
involved
following
some
boys
for
as
long
as
years
kinsey
was
able
to
identify
for
the
first
time
six
distinct
types
of
male
orgasm
some
of
which
involved
violent
contortions
at
the
peak
of
release
as
well
as
the
speed
and
the
capacity
of
climax
what
freud
had
only
imagined
about
childhood
sexuality
kinsey
had
reported
as
fact
children
were
indeed
erotic
beings
from
the
cradle
these
data
on
the
sexual
activities
of
younger
male
provide
an
important
substantiation
of
the
freudian
view
of
sexuality
as
a
component
that
is
present
in
the
human
animal
from
earliest
infancy
he
concluded
without
raising
eyebrows
in
then
along
came
judith
reisman
ignorng
the
legitimacy
of
kinseys
inquiry
she
beheld
the
ghost
of
mengele
in
bloomington
she
was
appalled
by
the
thought
of
infant
ecstasy
and
read
torture
in
the
portrayals
of
prepubertal
orgasm
rendered
by
the
government
worker
and
she
dared
to
say
that
kinsey
was
a
sex
criminal
well
was
he
or
wasnt
he
lets
go
to
the
text
there
is
no
evidence
in
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
no
witnesses
no
paper
noteven
a
trace
of
hearsay
that
implicates
kinsey
in
either
planning
or
partaking
in
child
sex
experiments
after
years
on
the
trail
reisman
has
uncovered
just
two
sources
to
back
up
her
original
charge
amazingly
enough
kinsey
himself
and
wardell
pomeroy
kinseys
coauthor
on
both
reports
to
whom
reisman
has
never
spoken
it
turns
out
that
her
whole
case
rests
on
a
few
passages
in
the
male
volume
iand
in
pomeroys
biography
titled
dr
kinsey
and
the
institute
for
sex
research
after
frisking
every
the
and
and
in
both
books
reisman
came
up
with
what
she
believes
are
smoking
sentences
to
establish
kinseys
alleged
role
in
the
planning
she
says
that
there
is
a
hint
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
male
volume
that
kinsey
directed
the
orgasm
studies
on
kids
she
cites
his
telltale
quote
from
a
critic
of
armchair
psychoanalysis
demanding
that
writerstest
their
theoriesby
empirical
study
and
statistical
procedures
then
she
combines
this
quote
with
kinseys
statement
that
some
of
the
observations
of
his
pedophile
sources
were
continued
over
periods
of
months
or
years
until
the
individuals
were
old
enough
to
make
it
certain
that
true
orgasm
was
involved
putting
two
and
two
together
kinseys
empiricism
and
lengthy
experimentation
she
arrives
at
her
hint
but
realizing
this
dog
would
not
hunt
she
devoted
but
a
single
paragraph
to
kinseys
supposed
planning
before
shifting
to
the
issue
of
his
personal
involvement
as
for
the
alleged
participation
after
poring
over
pomeroys
biography
reisman
found
several
hidden
clues
suggesting
kinseys
likely
handson
approach
to
kiddie
sex
here
the
chain
of
reasoning
is
more
complex
she
points
out
that
kinsey
was
interested
in
clitoral
measurements
collecting
sperm
and
filming
sex
in
his
attic
since
kinsey
did
indeed
mislead
indiana
university
about
the
purpose
of
his
cinematography
he
said
that
he
was
filming
animal
sex
reisman
asserts
that
a
similar
misrepresentation
may
yet
apply
to
kinseys
child
sex
experiments
catch
the
may
reisman
was
also
struck
by
kinseys
doubting
thomas
attitude
toward
the
never
before
recorded
climax
of
female
rabbits
kinsey
according
to
pomeroy
was
the
type
of
person
who
needed
to
see
things
for
himself
pomeroy
gave
the
example
of
orgasm
in
the
female
rabbit
because
he
had
not
personally
witnessed
this
event
kinsey
had
difficulty
in
accepting
its
reality
even
on
the
strength
of
testimony
from
a
distinguished
scientist
how
then
did
kinsey
testify
to
the
actuality
of
orgasm
in
a
infant
from
the
mere
history
of
a
sex
offender
but
of
course
he
did
not
he
depended
on
their
records
from
this
fantastic
alchemy
of
conjecture
mixed
with
clitorides
sperm
attic
cumshots
and
climaxincottontail
has
reisman
defamed
the
legendary
kinsey
paul
gebhard
succeeded
kinsey
as
the
director
of
the
kinsey
institute
and
now
lives
in
retirement
outside
bloomington
reached
by
telephone
gebhard
defended
the
pedophile
connection
and
denied
reismans
nasty
imputations
i
dont
understand
the
resistance
of
people
like
reisman
to
studying
the
sexuality
of
children
gebhard
said
more
in
exasperation
than
anger
that
is
where
sex
begins
we
were
happy
to
take
data
wherever
we
found
it
even
though
pedophiles
commit
criminal
acts
they
are
usually
not
violent
folks
they
wouldnt
be
very
successful
if
they
were
one
of
our
best
sources
was
a
headmaster
of
a
boys
school
who
maintained
a
kind
of
alumni
club
and
sometimes
went
to
the
weddings
of
his
former
students
as
for
directing
experiments
thats
absurd
we
never
told
any
of
our
subjects
what
to
do
lt
was
against
our
principles
almost
all
of
the
pedophile
material
was
retrospective
anyway
nor
did
we
ever
conduct
sex
experiments
with
children
ourselves
that
would
have
been
highly
inappropriate
i
asked
gebhard
if
kinsey
had
ever
seen
a
child
in
a
sexual
situation
i
think
a
mother
once
brought
in
a
little
girl
who
humped
her
teddy
bear
and
kinsey
watched
it
as
for
kinseys
sex
life
it
is
still
shrouded
in
confidentiality
he
was
married
to
the
same
woman
for
years
and
fathered
four
children
apparently
there
are
no
huge
sexual
revelations
although
rumors
of
homosexuality
have
persisted
without
confirmation
through
the
years
gebhard
took
his
bosss
history
back
in
the
but
he
refuses
to
discuss
what
he
knows
we
never
divulge
anything
about
anybodys
history
whether
dead
or
alive
he
says
reisman
said
no
to
an
interview
for
this
article
on
the
grounds
that
i
had
once
worked
for
penthouse
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
we
have
been
debating
each
other
in
various
forums
for
the
past
five
years
in
keeping
with
our
contentious
history
she
took
a
swipe
at
me
in
her
book
for
continuing
the
kinsey
practice
of
euphemizing
incest
my
offense
was
using
the
biblical
variant
lying
with
a
near
relative
in
a
article
on
the
subject
of
incest
as
a
synonym
for
intercourse
lying
with
appears
eight
times
in
genesis
ed
eichel
is
a
different
story
though
seemingly
obsessed
by
kinsey
like
his
coauthor
he
was
friendly
in
long
conversations
he
told
me
that
he
began
to
smell
a
big
baised
agenda
in
sexology
when
he
was
a
student
in
new
york
universitys
human
sexuality
program
in
the
early
it
was
literally
a
gay
studies
program
for
heterosexuals
he
says
around
eichel
came
upon
reismans
critique
of
kinsey
and
the
conspiracy
theory
started
to
sink
in
the
sex
establishment
was
ruled
by
a
kinseyan
bisexual
bund
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
heterosexual
norm
no
wonder
he
was
having
such
a
rough
time
promoting
the
joy
of
simultaneous
orgasm
anything
that
enhanced
sexual
compatibility
between
men
and
women
inevitably
raised
objections
eventually
eichel
exchanged
philosophical
fluids
with
reisman
and
from
this
union
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
was
born
eichels
main
contribution
to
the
book
is
discovery
and
analysis
of
a
kinsey
conspiracy
that
supposedly
seeks
the
establishment
of
bisexuality
as
the
balanced
sexual
orientation
for
normal
uninhibited
people
which
by
destroying
the
traditional
family
structure
and
normal
sexual
behavior
would
open
the
way
for
the
second
and
more
difficult
step
the
ultimate
goal
of
crossgenerational
sex
sex
with
children
when
i
pressed
him
for
specific
references
to
back
up
his
outrageous
contentions
he
said
weakly
you
dont
think
kinsey
is
going
to
come
right
out
and
say
that
everybody
is
basically
bisexual
and
should
have
sex
with
kids
but
this
is
implicit
in
the
kinsey
reports
meanwhile
eichel
is
demanding
a
congressional
investigation
of
kinsey
and
his
data
perfect
thats
just
what
the
country
needs

horribly
real
life

acting
on

the
lawmaster

an
illegal

some
thirty

of

teamed
up
with
state
and
tulsa
police
authorities
search
warrant
in

documents
papers
books

and
other
tangible

which
identify

or
owners
of

to

reports
vary
but
according
to
neighbors
the
joint
task
force
operation
aimed
at
the
unemployed
warehouseman
from
a
nearby
hospital
involved
some
agents
and
local
law
enforcement
personnel
against
lawmaster
they
cordoned
off
the
street
took
station
with
weapons
drawn
in
the
back

used
a

to
break
through

kicked

broke
into

threw
personal
papers
around
the

spilled
boxes
of

broke
into
a
small
locked
box
that
contained
precious
coins
stood
on
a

to
peer
through

tiles
breaking
the

then
they

the

of

if
true
and
if
gays
were
the

as
straights
except
for

preference
i
would
imagine
that
gays
would
have
much
less
sex
than
straights
because
the
available
pool
for

is
less
than
onetenth
what
it
is
for

somebody
correct

me
please
i
cannot
believe
i
am
posting
in
this
thread
but
what
the
hell
he
asked
for
it
i
had
sort
of
the
same
reaction
myself
when
i
was
first
realizing
i
was
bi
so
what
of
everyone
else
is
straight
id
never
end
up
with
a
guy
anyway
as
several
people
on
socbi
pointed
out
to
me
this
is
true
only
if
you
find
partners
for
relationships
or
just
for
sex
in
primarily
straight
circles
nowadays
with
gay
culture
quite
visible
in
major
cities
and
such
you
can
easily
find
yourself
in
an
overwhelmingly
queer
social
circle
if
you
so
choose
about
half
my
friends
are
bi
and
thats
just
from
hanging
out
in
the
science
fiction
club
and
going
to
ucbu
once
a
week
its
not
as
if
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
and
hang
out
in
bars
or
something
so
the
available
pool
for
dates
can
be
the
same
size
unless
of
course
youre
trying
to
date
a
random
sample
of
the
us
population
as
for
promiscuity
ive
traded
email
with
clayton
on
the
topic
and
he
still
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
admit
that
yes
gay
males
are
sometimes
forced
to
resort
to
anonymous
sex
because
theyre
closeted
and
cant
afford
to
be
seen
in
a
permanent
relationship
or
that
part
of
the
promiscuity
is
because
of
the
messedup
gender
roles
in
our
society
and
when
males
are
dating
males
and
theyve
all
been
trained
to
be
the
aggressor
in
sex
theres
going
to
be
more
sex
or
that
whats
dysfunctional
whats
screwed
up
is
societal
attitudes
not
gay
sexuality
and
thats
what
encourages
deviant
behavior
in
gay
males
also
note
that
just
because
someones
had
sex
partners
doesnt
mean
theyre
promiscuous
yes
it
sounds
ridiculous
but
its
quite
possible
for
someone
to
go
through
a
heavily
closeted
phase
in
which
they
have
lots
of
anonymous
sex
with
strangers
and
then
come
out
start
forming
real
relationships
and
be
monogamous

on

the
four
federal
agents
were
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry
and
ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at
risk
because
the
batf
operation
had
failed
to
meet
its
objective
a
standoff
ensued
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
then
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the
bureaus
efforts
were
ultimately
unavailing
because
the
individual
with
whom
they
were
dealing
david
koresh
was
dangerous
irrational
and
probably
insane
he
engaged
in
numerous
activities
which
violated
both
federal
law
and
common
standards
of
decency
he
was
moreover
responsible
for
the
deaths
and
injuries
which
occurred
during
the
action
against
the
compound
in
february
given
his
inclination
towards
violence
and
in
an
effort
to
protect
his
young
hostages
no
provocative
actions
were
taken
for
more
than
seven
weeks
by
federal
agents
against
the
compound
this
weekend
i
was
briefed
by
attorney
general
reno
on
an
operation
prepared
by
the
fbi
designed
to
increase
pressure
on
koresh
and
persuade
those
in
the
compound
to
surrender
peacefully
the
plan
included
a
decision
to
withhold
the
use
of
ammunition
even
in
the
face
of
fire
and
instead
to
use
tear
gas
that
would
not
cause
permanent
harm
to
health
but
would
it
was
hoped
force
the
people
in
the
compound
to
come
outside
and
to
surrender
i
was
informed
of
the
plan
to
end
the
siege
i
discussed
it
with
attorney
general
reno
i
asked
the
questions
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
i
then
told
her
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
and
i
take
full
responsibility
for
the
implementation
of
the
decision
yesterdays
action
ended
in
a
horrible
human
tragedy
mr
koreshs
response
to
the
demands
for
his
surrender
by
federal
agents
was
to
destroy
himself
and
murder
the
children
who
were
his
captives
as
well
as
all
the
other
people
who
were
there
who
did
not
survive
he
killed
those
he
controlled
and
he
bears
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
carnage
that
ensued
now
we
must
review
the
past
with
an
eye
towards
the
future
i
have
directed
the
united
stated
departments
of
justice
and
treasury
to
undertake
a
vigorous
and
thorough
investigation
to
uncover
what
happened
and
why
and
whether
anything
could
have
been
done
differently
i
have
told
the
departments
to
involve
independent
professional
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
investigation
i
expect
to
receive
analysis
and
answers
in
whatever
time
is
required
to
complete
the
review
finally
i
have
directed
the
departments
to
cooperate
fully
with
all
congressional
inquiries
so
that
we
can
continue
to
be
fully
accountable
to
the
american
people
i
want
to
express
my
appreciation
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
justice
department
and
to
the
federal
agents
on
the
front
lines
who
did
the
best
job
they
could
under
deeply
difficult
circumstances
again
i
want
to
say
as
i
did
yesterday
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
loss
of
life
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
tragedy
in
waco
i
hope
very
much
that
others
who
will
be
tempted
to
join
cults
and
to
become
involved
with
people
like
david
koresh
will
be
deterred
by
the
horrible
scenes
they
have
seen
over
the
last
seven
weeks
and
i
hope
very
much
that
the
difficult
situations
which
federal
agents
confronted
there
and
which
they
will
be
doubtless
required
to
confront
in
other
contexts
in
the
future
will
be
somewhat
better
handled
and
better
understood
because
of
what
has
been
learned
now
q
mr
president
can
you
first
of
all
tell
us
why
after
days
you
decided
q
mr
president
can
you
describe
for
us
what
it
is
that
janet
reno
outlined
to
you
in
your
phone
conversation
with
the
president
i
cant
hear
you
both
if
one
will
go
first
and
then
the
other
q
sorry
can
you
describe
what
janet
reno
q
mr
president
the
president
ill
answer
both
your
questions
but
i
cant
do
it
at
once
q
can
you
describe
what
she
told
you
on
sunday
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
and
how
much
detail
you
knew
about
it
the
president
yes
i
was
told
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
fbi
strongly
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
take
another
step
in
trying
to
dislodge
the
people
in
the
compound
and
she
described
generally
what
the
operation
would
be
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
use
tear
gas
which
had
been
tested
not
to
cause
permanent
damage
to
adults
or
to
children
but
which
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
people
to
stay
inside
the
building
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
tear
gas
would
permit
them
to
come
outside
i
was
further
told
that
under
no
circumstances
would
our
people
fire
any
shots
at
them
even
if
fired
upon
they
were
going
to
shoot
the
tear
gas
from
armored
vehicles
which
would
protect
them
and
there
would
be
no
exchange
of
fire
in
fact
as
you
know
an
awful
lot
of
shots
were
fired
by
the
cult
members
at
the
federal
officials
there
were
no
shots
coming
back
from
the
government
side
i
asked
a
number
of
questions
the
first
question
i
asked
is
why
now
we
have
waited
seven
weeks
why
now
the
reasons
i
was
given
were
the
following
number
one
that
there
was
a
limit
to
how
long
the
federal
authorities
could
maintain
with
their
limited
resources
the
quality
and
intensity
of
coverage
by
experts
there
they
might
be
needed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
number
two
that
the
people
who
had
reviewed
this
had
never
seen
a
case
quite
like
this
one
before
and
they
were
convinced
that
no
progress
had
been
made
recently
and
no
progress
was
going
to
be
made
through
the
normal
means
of
getting
koresh
and
the
other
cult
members
to
come
out
number
three
that
the
danger
of
their
doing
something
to
themselves
or
to
others
was
likely
to
increase
not
decrease
with
the
passage
of
time
and
number
four
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
children
who
were
still
inside
the
compound
were
being
abused
significantly
as
well
as
being
forced
to
live
in
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
so
for
those
reasons
they
wanted
to
move
at
that
time
the
second
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general
is
whether
they
had
given
consideration
to
all
of
the
things
that
could
go
wrong
and
evaluated
them
against
what
might
happen
that
was
good
she
said
that
the
fbi
personnel
on
the
scene
and
those
working
with
them
were
convinced
that
the
chances
of
bad
things
happening
would
only
increase
with
the
passage
of
time
the
third
question
i
asked
was
has
the
military
been
consulted
as
soon
as
the
initial
tragedy
came
to
light
in
waco
thats
the
first
thing
i
asked
to
be
done
because
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
not
a
typical
law
enforcement
situation
military
people
were
then
brought
in
helped
to
analyze
the
situation
and
some
of
the
problems
that
were
presented
by
it
and
so
i
asked
if
the
military
had
been
consulted
the
attorney
general
said
that
they
had
and
that
they
were
in
basic
agreement
that
there
was
only
one
minor
tactical
difference
of
opinion
between
the
fbi
and
the
military
something
that
both
sides
thought
was
not
of
overwhelming
significance
having
asked
those
questions
and
gotten
those
answers
i
said
that
if
she
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
that
she
should
proceed
and
that
i
would
support
it
and
i
stand
by
that
today
q
mr
president
the
president
wait
go
ahead
q
can
you
address
the
widespread
perception
reported
widely
television
radio
and
newspapers
that
you
were
trying
somehow
to
distance
yourself
from
this
disaster
the
president
no
im
bewildered
by
it
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
let
me
say
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
is
that
i
had
nothing
to
add
to
what
was
being
said
and
i
literally
did
not
know
until
rather
late
in
the
day
whether
anybody
was
still
alive
other
than
those
who
had
been
actually
seen
and
taken
to
the
hospital
or
taken
into
custody
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
waiting
for
events
to
unfold
there
was
i
have
i
cant
account
for
why
people
speculated
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
talked
to
the
attorney
general
on
the
day
before
the
action
took
place
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
i
called
her
again
late
last
night
after
she
appeared
on
the
larry
king
show
and
i
talked
to
her
again
this
morning
a
president
it
is
not
possible
for
a
president
to
distance
himself
from
things
that
happen
when
the
federal
government
is
in
control
i
will
say
this
however
i
was
frankly
surprised
would
be
a
mild
word
to
say
that
anyone
that
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
should
resign
because
some
religious
fanatics
murdered
themselves
applause
i
regret
what
happened
but
it
is
not
possible
in
this
life
to
control
the
behavior
of
others
in
every
circumstance
these
people
killed
four
federal
officials
in
the
line
of
duty
they
were
heavily
armed
they
fired
on
federal
officials
yesterday
repeatedly
and
they
were
never
fired
back
on
we
did
everything
we
could
to
avoid
the
loss
of
life
they
made
the
decision
to
immolate
themselves
and
i
regret
it
terribly
and
i
feel
awful
about
the
children
but
in
the
end
the
last
comment
i
had
from
janet
reno
is
when
and
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
i
said
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
once
more
why
you
believe
not
why
they
believe
why
you
believe
we
should
move
now
rather
than
wait
some
more
and
she
said
its
because
of
the
children
they
have
evidence
that
those
children
are
still
being
abused
and
that
theyre
in
increasingly
unsafe
conditions
and
that
they
dont
think
it
will
get
any
easier
with
time
with
the
passage
of
time
i
have
to
take
their
word
for
that
so
that
is
where
i
think
things
stand
q
can
we
assume
then
that
you
dont
think
this
was
mishandled
in
view
of
the
outcome
that
you
didnt
run
out
of
patience
and
if
you
had
it
to
do
over
again
would
you
really
decide
that
way
the
president
no
well
i
think
what
you
can
assume
is
just
exactly
what
i
announced
today
this
is
a
the
fbi
has
done
a
lot
of
things
right
for
this
country
over
a
long
period
of
time
this
is
the
same
fbi
that
found
the
people
that
bombed
the
world
trade
center
in
licketysplit
record
time
we
want
an
inquiry
to
analyze
the
steps
along
the
way
is
there
something
else
we
should
have
known
is
there
some
other
question
they
should
have
asked
is
there
some
other
question
i
should
have
asked
can
i
say
for
sure
that
no
one
that
we
could
have
done
nothing
else
to
make
the
outcome
come
different
i
dont
know
that
thats
why
i
want
the
inquiry
and
thats
why
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
we
have
some
independent
law
enforcement
people
not
political
people
but
totally
nonpolitical
outside
experts
who
can
bring
to
bear
the
best
evidence
we
have
there
is
unfortunately
a
rise
in
this
sort
of
fanaticism
all
across
the
world
and
we
may
have
to
confront
it
again
and
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anything
we
can
do
particularly
when
there
are
children
involved
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
wrongdoers
in
this
case
were
the
people
who
killed
others
and
then
killed
themselves
q
mr
president
were
there
any
other
options
presented
to
you
for
resolving
this
situation
at
any
point
from
february
until
yesterday
the
president
well
yes
i
got
regular
reports
all
along
the
way
there
were
lots
of
other
options
pursued
if
you
go
back
you
all
covered
it
very
well
the
fbi
you
did
a
very
good
job
of
it
i
mean
the
fbi
and
the
other
authorities
there
pursued
any
number
of
other
options
all
along
the
way
and
a
lot
of
them
early
on
seemed
to
be
working
some
of
the
children
got
out
some
of
the
other
people
left
there
was
a
at
one
point
there
seemed
to
be
some
lines
of
communication
opening
up
between
koresh
and
the
authorities
and
then
he
would
say
things
and
not
do
them
and
things
just
began
to
spin
downward
whether
there
were
other
in
terms
of
what
happened
yesterday
the
conversation
i
had
with
the
attorney
general
did
not
involve
other
options
except
whether
we
should
take
more
time
with
the
present
strategy
we
were
pursuing
because
they
said
they
wanted
to
do
this
because
they
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
get
people
out
of
the
compound
quickly
before
they
could
kill
themselves
thats
what
they
thought
q
did
the
government
know
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
q
congressional
hearings
once
the
situation
are
you
in
agreement
with
that
the
president
thats
up
to
the
congress
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
but
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
treasury
and
justice
departments
launch
this
investigation
and
bring
in
some
outside
experts
and
as
i
said
in
my
statement
if
any
congressional
committees
want
to
look
into
it
we
will
fully
cooperate
there
is
nothing
to
hide
here
this
was
probably
the
most
wellcovered
operation
of
its
kind
in
the
history
of
the
country
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
very
well
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
while
the
adults
did
so
the
children
had
no
chance
because
this
gas
was
very
she
said
it
was
not
lethal
but
it
was
very
dangerous
to
the
children
and
they
could
not
have
survived
without
gas
masks
and
on
february
lets
go
back
didnt
those
people
have
a
right
to
practice
their
religion
the
president
they
were
not
just
practicing
their
religion
they
were
the
treasury
department
believed
that
they
had
violated
federal
laws
any
number
of
them
q
what
federal
laws
the
president
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
gas
masks
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpose
of
using
the
tear
gas
was
that
it
had
been
tested
they
were
convinced
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
force
anybody
that
breathed
it
to
run
outside
and
one
of
the
things
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
details
of
this
because
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
things
that
they
were
speculating
about
today
was
that
the
wind
was
blowing
so
fast
that
the
windows
might
have
been
opened
and
some
of
the
gas
might
have
escaped
and
that
may
be
why
it
didnt
have
the
desired
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
was
an
underground
compound
a
bus
buried
underground
where
the
children
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hoping
very
much
that
if
the
children
were
not
released
immediately
outside
that
the
humane
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
children
would
be
sent
someplace
where
they
could
be
protected
in
terms
of
the
gas
masks
themselves
i
learned
yesterday
i
did
not
ask
this
fact
question
before
that
the
gas
was
supposed
to
stay
active
in
the
compound
longer
than
the
gas
masks
themselves
were
to
work
so
that
it
was
thought
that
even
if
they
all
had
gas
masks
that
eventually
the
gas
would
force
them
out
in
a
nonviolent
nonshooting
circumstance
ms
myers
last
question
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
that
q
could
you
tell
us
whether
or
not
you
ever
asked
janet
reno
about
the
possibility
of
a
mass
suicide
and
when
you
learned
about
the
actual
fire
and
explosion
what
went
through
your
mind
during
those
horrendous
moments
the
president
what
i
asked
janet
reno
is
if
they
had
considered
all
the
worse
things
that
could
happen
and
she
said
and
of
course
the
whole
issue
of
suicide
had
been
raised
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debated
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
people
who
were
most
knowledgeable
about
these
kinds
of
issues
concluded
that
there
was
no
greater
risk
of
that
now
than
there
would
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
that
or
at
anytime
in
the
future
that
was
the
judgment
they
made
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
of
course
we
will
never
know
what
happened
when
i
saw
the
fire
when
i
saw
the
building
burning
i
was
sick
i
felt
terrible
and
my
immediate
concern
was
whether
the
children
had
gotten
out
and
whether
they
were
escaping
or
whether
they
were
inside
trying
to
burn
themselves
up
thats
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
know
thank
you
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
it
was
a
janet
reno
decision
isnt
it
in
the
end
your
decision
the
president
well
what
im
saying
is
that
i
didnt
have
a
four
or
fivehour
detailed
briefing
from
the
fbi
i
didnt
go
over
every
strategic
part
of
it
it
is
a
decision
for
which
i
take
responsibility
im
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
signed
off
on
the
general
decision
and
giving
her
the
authority
to
make
the
last
call
when
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
some
time
had
elapsed
she
might
have
made
a
decision
to
change
her
mind
i
said
if
you
decide
to
go
forward
with
this
tomorrow
i
will
support
you
and
i
do
support
her
she
is
not
ultimately
responsible
to
the
american
people
i
am
but
i
think
she
has
conducted
her
duties
in
an
appropriate
fashion
and
she
has
dealt
with
this
situation
i
think
as
well
as
she
could
have
thank
you
applause

so

erm
umm
if
you
define
yourself
as
normal
then
it
is
for
you
to
prove
that
you
are
within
limits
which
then
brings
in
the

what
are
the

for

we

intolerance
normal

it

look

if
you
went
to

clayton
school
of
logic
doesnt
it
how
disparaging
you
are
towards
political
minorities
sexual
deviants
do
not
comprise
a
political
minority
again
an
astounding
lack
of
logic
wow
you
must
define
what
you
say
such
that
everyone
agrees
here
you
have
used
the
phrase
sexual
deviant
how
in
the
hell
do
you
define
that
as
someone
who
does
something
sexually
that
you
dont
by
this
definition
you
most
probably
mean
the
majority
of
the
planet
how
do
you
know
that
your
next
door
neighbour
doesnt
like
custard
to
be
spread
over
his
genetalia
then
have
it
licked
off
by
his
wife
is
this
sexual
deviancy
how
do
we
know
that
you
dont
like
something
sexually
which
others
may
find
repulsive
is
having
sex
doggy
fashion
a
sexual
deviancy
please
be
more
specific
and
where
you
do
back
up
your
claims
or
i
may
have
to
go
to
hospital
due
to
laughing
too
much
at
yours
and
claytons
postings
secondly
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
phrase
sexual
deviant
means
such
people
as
homosexuals
bisexuals
c
basically
everyone
you
dont
like
i
think
that
your
phrase
do
not
comprise
a
political
minority
why
the
brackets
is
a
nonsequiteur
gay
groups
exist
which
lobby
their
governments
that
is
a
fact
prove
it
false
hence
they
are
a
politial
group
you
state
that
they
are
not
a
political
minority
are
they
therefore
a
political
majority
i
think
you
boobed
really
big
on
this
one
try
thinking
about
your
arguments
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
i
only
associate
with
girls
who
do
indeed
have
selfrespect
but
were
i
to
find
myself
with
the
sort
who
would
be
inclined
to
head
out
the
door
on
account
of
my
views
regarding
the
aberrant
behavior
known
as
homosexuality
i
would
encourage
her
to
indeed
do
so
and
i
would
further
advise
her
not
to
let
the
door
whack
her
on
the
backside
on
the
way
out
who
needs
such
an
airhead
prove
the
first
statement
please
dates
phone
numbers
c
again
your
logic
fails
again
you
make
statements
which
you
cannot
and
most
probably
will
not
maintain
you
state
that
a
person
girl
in
this
context
who
considers
equal
rights
for
all
humans
to
be
an
airhead
as
clayton
your
best
mate
would
say
it
just
shows
how
screwed
up
you
are
pretty
soon
they
will
find
themselves
retreating
back
into
the
closet
where
they
belong
dont
count
on
it
sweetheart
oh
i
cant
do
anything
but
count
on
it
after
all
it
is
inevitable
for
it
is
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
throughout
history
nature
has
always
asserted
itself
dont
be
so
arrogant
as
to
assume
that
this
foolish
and
misguided
generation
can
change
the
nature
of
man
where
practically
every
other
generation
has
failed
greater
men
than
you
havent
been
able
to
do
this
the
above
most
certainly
will
happen
no
matter
how
much
you
may
wish
to
pretend
otherwise
proof
please
proof
that
homosexuality
is
not
part
of
the
natural
order
proof
that
nature
has
always
asserted
itself
are
you
saying
that
nature
is
a
conciousness
are
you
pretending
that
you
have
the
ability
to
see
the
future
are
you
godtm
in
fact
by
your
arguement
are
you
waiting

paul
bartholomew
writes
a
very
well
put
together
post
i
disagree
with
several
key
points
but
the
post
is
an
excellent
one
with
which
to
engage
in
discourse
there
has
been
much
discussion
recently
about
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
mr
cramer
and
mr
ronzone
appear
to
take
an
absolutist
position
on
this
rightthat
it
is
a
fundamental
human
right
perhaps
the
fundamental
human
right
and
that
it
supersedes
other
rights
such
as
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
others
feel
that
a
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
thus
we
have
the
neverending
debate
that
flares
up
repeatedly
freedom
of
association
foa
involves
the
mutual
and
voluntary
agreement
of
two
or
more
people
right
to
equal
opportunity
lets
call
it
reo
involves
coercion
in
all
cases
by
definition
a
major
problem
is
that
neither
of
these
rights
are
explicitly
declared
or
protected
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
declaration
of
independence
although
both
can
be
derived
from
these
documents
unfortunately
this
means
that
the
debate
will
never
end
because
neither
side
can
conclu
sively
prove
the
validity
of
their
viewit
becomes
solely
a
matter
of
personal
philosophy
yes
there
is
much
debate
but
no
it
can
end
with
once
and
for
all
recognition
of
these
rights
well
not
totally
perfect
end
but
end
in
the
same
way
that
there
is
no
worldwide
disagreement
that
say
murder
is
a
crime
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
real
answer
lies
somewhere
in
between
i
regard
both
of
these
rights
as
fundamental
human
rights
which
unfortu
nately
come
into
direct
conflict
with
one
another
which
is
stronger
depends
on
the
given
situation
hmm
there
is
even
more
discusion
about
religion
should
we
take
a
somewhere
in
between
approach
towards
the
state
a
state
recognized
religion
the
first
amendment
is
so
uh
so
absolutist
you
know
for
example
if
the
owner
of
a
momandpop
store
wishes
to
hire
an
employee
to
help
out
their
right
to
freedom
of
association
outweighs
the
rights
of
their
job
applicants
to
an
equal
opportunity
they
should
be
free
to
hire
whomever
they
choose
using
whatever
criteria
they
choose
without
any
government
intervention
at
all
similarly
if
a
family
wishes
to
rent
out
a
bedroom
in
their
home
or
a
garage
apartment
or
something
similar
then
their
right
to
freedom
of
association
outweighs
the
rights
of
their
prospective
tenants
to
an
equal
opportunity
if
on
the
other
hand
ibm
a
multinational
corporation
with
employees
publicly
owned
and
operated
by
a
board
of
directors
wishes
to
hire
additional
employees
then
whose
freedom
of
association
are
we
protecting
the
board
of
directors
the
other
employees
the
owners
of
the
stock
in
this
case
the
applicants
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
we
as
a
society
can
ask
ibm
to
use
only
those
criteria
which
are
relevant
to
the
specific
task
why
says
who
why
can
mon
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forced
and
force
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
as
purchase
of
ibm
is
voluntary
then
there
are
very
well
defined
procedures
on
how
ibm
chooses
to
do
some
things
and
chooses
to
do
other
things
why
not
let
those
same
procedures
work
for
employment
policies
similarly
if
a
landlord
owns
a
number
of
apartment
buildings
in
which
he
does
not
live
and
which
are
managed
by
an
independent
management
agency
then
whose
freedom
of
association
are
we
protecting
if
the
owner
does
not
live
in
his
buildings
and
has
no
contact
with
his
tenants
then
the
prospective
tenants
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
we
as
a
society
can
ask
the
owner
to
use
only
those
criteria
which
are
relevant
to
good
tenants
ive
put
good
in
quotation
marks
because
i
really
dont
want
to
be
drawn
off
into
the
side
issue
of
what
constitutes
a
good
tenant
why
does
this
tenant
have
an
option
i
wont
call
it
a
right
to
destroy
the
foa
of
the
landlord
if
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
cant
agree
then
they
both
can
cease
from
using
each
others
property
suddenly
by
arm
waving
by
magic
a
landlord
does
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basis
does
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seems
that
vague
terms
like
no
contact
with
tenants
suffice
well
i
think
foa
is
one
our
most
important
rightts
in
the
top
and
by
golly
if
the
state
is
going
to
make
it
suffer
i
sure
would
like
to
see
the
heinous
crime
that
justifies
the
removal
of
this
right
i
dont
think
no
contact
with
the
tenats
is
even
a
crime
much
less
something
that
should
cause
severe
interference
with
important
rights
i
suspect
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
this
country
agree
with
my
position
on
these
extreme
cases
particularly
if
they
are
presented
in
this
manner
i
dont
know
if
mr
ronzone
or
mr
cramer
would
agreei
suspect
not
in
any
case
additional
problems
arise
when
we
try
to
apply
guidelines
for
the
middle
ground
what
if
the
company
has
employees
or
or
where
do
we
draw
the
line
between
protecting
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
protecting
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
rights
are
not
defined
by
majoritymob
choice
foa
is
an
absolute
reo
is
a
fancy
name
for
thuggery
for
racism
and
coercion
the
difficulty
is
that
any
line
we
draw
will
of
necessity
be
artificial
and
any
legislation
resulting
will
be
flawed
in
the
past
the
government
has
usually
tried
to
pass
laws
which
referred
to
the
number
of
employees
hired
by
the
companyeg
any
company
with
more
than
xxx
employees
was
affected
by
the
law
those
with
fewer
were
unaffected
of
course
it
would
be
you
dimly
see
that
the
line
must
be
artifiacial
because
foa
is
the
only
right
just
like
a
state
religion
you
cant
jsutify
that
either
generally
i
believe
that
if
we
do
not
have
any
regulations
affecting
these
rights
then
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
will
be
stronger
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
regulations
protect
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
too
much
weakening
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
i
dont
believe
there
is
a
satisfactory
solution
which
will
please
everybody
a
solution
that
i
came
up
with
is
to
use
publicly
owned
vs
privately
owned
as
the
dividing
line
if
the
company
remains
privately
owned
then
the
owners
should
be
free
to
do
whatever
they
want
with
their
company
if
the
company
becomes
publicly
owned
then
the
public
has
a
right
to
ask
the
company
to
submit
to
additional
regulation
why
i
assume
that
when
you
say
publicly
owned
you
are
talking
about
those
quasistate
companys
that
do
not
have
shareholders
the
companies
on
the
fortune
for
example
are
all
privately
owned
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
their
owners
they
have
no
anonymous
unknown
to
them
owners
by
the
way
the
above
analysis
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
are
both
fundamental
human
rights
of
equal
importance
since
this
is
entirely
a
matter
of
faith
not
subject
to
any
proof
i
do
not
choose
to
even
try
to
establish
this
you
either
accept
it
or
you
dont
any
comments
foa
can
be
derived
by
any
two
rational
people
on
a
basis
that
neither
has
evil
malicious
or
murderous
intent
towards
the
others
in
short
agreement
is
mutual
or
not
at
all
your
reo
on
the
other
hand
lives
only
by
accepting
coercion
the
gun
into
the
situation
and
that
is
selfdestructive
of
the
whole
argument
because
it
is
based
only
on
might
makes
right
sort
of
like
saying
nobody
has
a
right
to
live
whereupon
i
whip
out
a
gun
and
shoot
you

youre
not
buying
insurance
so
much
as
being
coerced
into
one
insurance
plan
no
it
is
optional
as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept
it
there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in
particular
that
ask
for
exemptions
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
its
optional
but
what
if
you
dont
want
basic
coverage
on
the
governments
terms
you
said
before
that
if
you
opt
out
youre
basically
uninsured
there
are
two
things
at
work
here
the
public
insurance
is
very
wide
in
what
it
will
cover
as
the
amortization
is
also
universal
no
private
plan
can
boast
of
a
plan
that
fits
a
gaussian
curve
and
as
our
private
sector
has
discovered
theyre
better
off
not
offering
insurance
coverage
that
their
customers
are
going
to
use
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
so
in
a
sense
theyve
stopped
being
truly
capitalists
if
they
dont
have
to
worry
about
competing
anymore
you
might
say
that
the
total
effect
is
one
of
socialized
medicinea
government
providing
the
basics
and
a
cartel
providing
the
extras
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
system
desirable
or
not
the
alternative
to
the
system
is
no
system
at
all
patients
opted
out
doctors
opted
out
or
both
but
that
only
for
insurance
and
you
cant
force
a
private
insurance
company
to
sell
you
a
plan
that
they
will
not
offer
and
remember
that
the
actual
health
care
is
delivered
by
private
entities
who
collect
from
the
public
insurance
voluntarily
again
they
cant
force
a
private
entity
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
plus
there
is
the
matter
of
culture
and
values
im
basically
antitax
and
antigovernment
by
canadian
standards
yet
i
cant
bring
myself
to
make
the
same
arguments
as
you
do
despite
that
i
understand
where
youre
coming
from
up
north
youre
so
much
more
likely
to
find
someone
protesting
taxes
going
to
defence
than
health
insurance
premiums
to
only
one
fund
for
basic
coverage
interesting
side
notehave
any
new
insurance
companies
started
upfrom
scratchsince
medicare
became
standard
in
canada
i
actually
have
doubts
that
any
new
ones
have
emerged
since
ww
i
no
scratch
that
there
are
a
few
in
western
canada
and
quite
a
few
in
quebec
as
part
of
the
quebec
miracle
out
with
the
nationalism
in
with
the
french
capitalism
la
groupe
des
cooper
antes
built
a
new
tower
by
the
eatons
store
at
les
terraces
and
if
you
were
able
to
catch
urban
angel
on
cbss
crimetime
youd
see
it
as
the
welllit
one
with
doubleturrets
at
the
top
as
for
ontario
which
still
dominates
and
anchors
business
up
north
i
meant
new
companies
not
new
buildings
yes
primarily
in
quebec
and
in
alberta
sorry
i
musta
lost
you
in
that
verbose
blurb
its
not
really
insurance
if
you
dont
have
alternatives
well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
true
but
i
would
be
more
comfortable
with
a
system
in
which
basic
care
provided
by
the
government
was
optional
not
mandatory
in
canada
and
germany
its
not
mandatory
however
it
is
negative
option
in
that
you
must
request
the
exemption
that
the
private
sector
will
not
provide
private
basic
coverage
if
offered
the
option
as
in
the
quebec
case
tells
me
something
about
what
they
know
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
another
problem
with
the
us
system
that
should
be
resolved
doesnt
canada
have
something
like
ten
times
the
proportion
of
gps
to
specialists
that
the
us
does
yes
but
part
of
the
reason
is
that
our
most
of
our
markets
are
too
small
to
sustain
many
specialists
sometimes
not
even
one
so
you
pretty
well
have
to
be
a
gp
to
get
paid
and
if
you
do
get
the
training
the
doctors
monopoly
might
block
your
getting
of
a
licence
because
there
is
already
someone
in
the
business
and
who
cannot
fill
hisher
appointment
book
that
we
have
a
cma
doctors
monopoly
is
something
that
the
american
amaoriented
medical
lobby
never
tells
you
down
here
the
problem
is
in
a
specialty
your
skill
often
directly
correlates
to
your
pay
a
good
cardiologist
makes
more
than
a
merely
adequate
cardiologist
more
than
it
does
in
general
practice
in
that
circumstance
its
hard
to
blame
people
for
going
into
specialties
no
i
respect
people
who
do
specialties
okay
all
of
my
md
friends
are
but
theres
the
question
of
our
small
market
dynamics
up
north
if
anything
that
our
private
doctors
and
hospitals
sell
their
services
to
americans
to
generate
more
business
will
inflate
their
effective
population
served
and
thus
make
some
specialties
finally
viable
ie
there
will
be
enough
customers
we
just
do
not
have
enough
sick
canadians
in
absolute
numbers
otherwise
i
personally
think
an
approach
like
germanys
would
be
bestwhere
the
companies
compete
for

of

of

that
way
uh
germany
basically
uses
our
method
with
their
many
sickness
funds
the
competition
is
fake
if
it
exists
at
all
because

interlinked

insurance
while
canada
organizes
by
province
germany
organizes
the
paperwork
around
big
corporations
and
regional
offices
but
remember
that
we
have
provinces
that
have
the
same
population
as
some
major
german
corporations
germans
have
public
health
insurance
just
that
it
is
brokered
by
smaller
entities
actually
brokerage
of
basic
by
private
firms
wholl
sell
extra
insurance
to
fill
out
their
policies
sort
of
a
voucher
system
was
one
of
the
first
ideas
floated
in
canada
too
remember
the
germans
dont
have
hmos
a
telling
sign
cos
rochester
does
and
theyre
also
a
company
town
but
there
was
a
washington
post
article
recently
about
that
that
said
canadian
doctors
often
use
myelograms
instead
of
mris
which
require
spinal
injections
and
can
cause
seizures
and
headaches
mickey
kaus
in
the
new
republic
probably
spoke
for
most
americans
when
he
said
who
needs
that
i
think
people
here
generally
like
to
believe
they
can
easily
get
the
most
hightech
treatment
even
if
they
really
cant
afford
it
ill
have
to
let
a
canadian
md
jump
in
to
verify
that
claim
but
ive
come
to
learn
to
suspect
anything
in
the
american
press
about
our
system
if
much
or
some
of
it
were
true
youd
have
to
take
us
for
idiots
for
tolerating
it
and
given
that
our
insurance
was
installed
during
a
period
when
there
were
only
liberal
and
tory
governments
federally
and
provincially
and
the
socialists
are
still
chafing
they
wouldve
pressed

think

such

has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back
down
from
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
since
that
only
encourages
other
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
not
an
accurate
analogy
david
koresh
did
not
take
a
bunch
of
hostages
and
then
call
the
batf
with
a
ransom
note
you
make
it
sound
as
if
the

showed

i
have
some

news
for
youbatf

absolutely
no

in

cases
it
seems
to
me
that
the
batf
showed
up
took
the
davidians
hostage
then
the
fbi
showed
up
negotiated
to
have
a
few
of

released

were

two

arrested

for
taking
pictures
of

later
released
on

jh
you
could

take
a
few
lines
from
a
story
and
imply
something
with
it
but
dont
say
what
you
really
mean
the
police
always
close
off
the
area
around
a
major
crime
scene
to
keep
evidence
from
being
disturbed
by
taking
pictures
they
leave
foot
prints
they
may
drop
some
trash
on

ground
and
they
may
pick
up
something
that
looks
interesting
and
it
is
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
the
closed
off
area
one
of
the
photographers
also
quickly
spun
around
with
a
long
lens
camera
while
the
officer
was
approaching
a
good
way
to
get
shot
well
that
hopefully
depends
on
what

has
nothing

police
are
not

to

let

gun

there
was
also
no

gary
l
dare
writes
again
they
cant
force
a
private
entity
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
so
the
government
by
sheer
economic
force
has
basically
cleared
the
basiccare
market
for
itself
the
only
way
to
test
this
would
be
for
some
really
daring
person
to
start
up
from
scratch
in
alberta
andor
quebec
a
health
insurance
company
offering
basic
care
crazy
yes
but
thats
almost
how
mci
got
started
however
the
concept
of
risks
is
well
known
by
insurance
actuaries
and
no
private
firm
can
get
the
kind
of
amortization
that
the
public
pools
can
get
and
since
health
insurance
gets
spent
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
insurance
ceos
and
you
get
a
situation
like
in
the
us
where
rates
keep
going
up
to
catch
up
see
what
i
mean
its
a
government
monopoly
sure
because
its
a
nonmarket
phenomenom
and
the
free
market
cant
solve
it
even
our
private
insurance
says
that
and
remember
last
year
quebec
proposed
giving
the
least
risky
parts
of
basic
care
to
the
private
sector
and
they
balked
like
you
saidwhy
should
they
and
wants
no
part
of
it
by
your
own
arguments
if
you
dont
want
the
provincial
plan
youre
basically
up
a
creek
yes
but
in
our
culture
arguing
against
it
is
like
arguing
for
national
defence
by
means
of
warlords
true
according
to
polls
ive
read
usually
in
the
sort
of
simpleminded
stuff
you
were
initally
responding
to
something
like
of
americans
would
like
canadianstyle
health
care
whereas
only
of
canadians
would
like
it
our
way
id
be
interested
to
know
why
there
are
that
many
of
canadas
population
is
about
a
million
or
so
people
canada
is
saturated
by
american
media
while
pundits
come
on
cable
and
talk
about
how
awful
our
health
care
is
supposed
to
be
what
people
experience
up
north
ends
up
not
differing
from
what
they
see
portrayed
on
american
television
in
movies
ie
same
infrastructure
different
insurance
makeup
yet
they
know
not
of
any
insurance
problems
and
have
no
idea
of
what
an
hmo
is
but
having
lots
of
british
tv
as
well
they
know
that
they
dont
like
nhs
someone
must
have
a
reason
to
argue
against
it
valid
or
notwhat
kind
of
people
are
they
the
polls
that
you
refer
to
for
the
canadian
data
are
from
the
annual
july
polls
conducted
for
macleans
our
major
english
newsmagazine
by
decima
research
decima
president
allen
gregg
is
considered
one
of
the
worlds
top
poll
researchers
and
mulroneys
conservatives
have
relied
on
him
to
keep
in
power
in
the
face
of
impossible
election
situations
the
american
polls
are
harris
polls
and
have
been
reposted
on
usenet
a
few
times
and
probably
will
again
im
sorta
suspicious
myself
cos
maybe
americans
want
universal
coverage
like
canada
i
honestly
doubt
that
most
americans
realize
that
we
have
private
doctors
and
public
and
private
hospitals
ie
similiar
health
care
infrastructure
and
our
system
is
basically
pure
insurance
without
hmos
given
recent
turnarounds
by
the
hiaa
endorsing
universal
coverage
and
hostility
to
corporatist
hmos
within
the
ama
and
the
complete
silence
vis
a
vis
canadabashing
by
the
ama
i
suspect
that
theyre
keeping
the
secret
about
canada
up
their
sleeve
exactly
wouldnt
you
until
the
idea
of
managed
competition
arose
there
was
no
direct
threat
to
standalone
private
practice
in
the
the
ama
fought
hmos
as
corporatized
socialist
medicine
part
of
the
reason
why
we
have
only
insurance
and
no
hmos
in
canada
cos
that
was
part
of
the
deal
cut
with
the
cma
ive
also
read
that
the
three
biggest
american
hmos
can
be
compared
straight
up
against
some
of
the
smaller
canadian
provinces
in
the
maritimes
and
they
spend
something
like
less
per
patient
maybe
it
does
help
the
american
hmos
can
still
cream
and
they
probably
cover
a
smaller
geographic
area
than
even
our
smallest
provinces
geography
again
some
of
them
are
spread
out
across
the
whole
country
i
think
but
each
site
is
probably
compact
and
the
clientele
are
creamed
and
dont
forget
that
hmos
place
caps
on
your
coverage
and
often
wont
tell
you
about
additional
procedures
you
could
get
otherwise
despite
that
you
might
be
willing
to
pay
for

read
your
complete
file
of
postings
to
socmotss
and
to
put
it
bluntly
it
does
not
support
your
assertion
in
short
this
claim
is
bogus
thank
you
for
confirming
this
all
those
postings
in
defense
of
adults
having
sex
with
children
and
you
just
choose
to
claim
that
they
dont
say
anything
of
the
sort
theres
no
point
in
discussing
this
any
further
then
you
are
clearly
a
liar
without
morals
of
any

prepared
to
justify
child
molestation
clayton
are
you
really
an
idiot
or
do
you
just
play

on
usenet
you
claimed
you
had
postings
from
a
dozen
ie
socmotss
posters
that
supported
child
molestation
point
aside
that
they
were
really
defending
abolishing
or
modifying
the
age
of
consent
laws
or
the
right
to
be
attracted
but
dont
act
upon
desires
for
children
so
out
of
thousands
is
an
overwhelming
majority
you
never
cease
to
amaze
me
and
you
still
havent
told
me

my
relationship
with
my

is

let
me
try

as
ive

im
not
necessarily
disputing
the
benefits
of
eliminating
anticompetitive
legislation
with
regard
to
auto
dealers
barbers
etc
one
need
not
however
swallow
the
entire
libertarian
agenda
to
accomplish
this
end
just
because
one
grants
the
benefits
of
allowing
anyone
who
wishes
to
cut
hair
to
sell
hisher
services
without
regulation
does
not
mean
that
the
same
unregulated
barbers
should
be
free
to
bleed
people
as
a
medical
service
without
government
intervention
as
somemany
libertarians
would
argue
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
government
regulation
is
obviously
worthwhile
the
libertarian
agenda
however
does
not
call
for
this
assessment
it
assumes
that
the
costs
of
regulation
of
any
kind
always
outweigh
its
benefits
this
approach
avoids
all
sorts
of
difficult
analysis
but
it
strikes
many
of
the
rest
of
us
as
dogmatic
to
say
the
least
i
have
no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical
care
education
national
defense
or
local
police
that
suggests
a
free
market
can
provide
a
more
effective
efficient
means
of
accomplishing
social
objectives
than
is
provided
through
statist
approaches
with
some
notable
exceptions
however
i
do
not
see
such
nittygritty
worthwhile
analysis
being
carried
out
by
selfprofessed
libertarians
excellently
put
even
as
a
libertarian
i
have
to
admit
government
does
do
some
things
i
like
there
is
a
beautiful
performing
arts
complex
in
ft
lauderdale
that
was
partially
built
with
tax
dollars
i
dont
know
how
much
was
private
and
how
much
was
stolen
i
mean
public
but
it
is
beautiful
and
i
enjoy
it
keep
in
mind
though
most
of
the
people
in
the
city
will
never
attend
a
single
performance
there
so
they
might
feel
differently
about
having
to
help
pay
for
it
however
i
have
to
disagree
about
it
being
desireable
or
efficient
to
give
government
interventionpower
on
a
casebycase
basis
in
fact
we
have
a
lot
better
luck
maintaining
our
freedom
of
speech
precisely
because
it
is
not
decided
on
a
casebycase
basis
as
much
as
other
issues
judges
decide
whether
political
speech
is
allowed
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
they
do
not
try
to
decide
just
whether
pronazi
prochoice
prolife
or
protax
political
speech
should
be
allowed
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
you
can
imagine
the
result
if
right
to
free
speech
was
decided
by
the
majority
on
a
casebycase
basis
not
so
with
economic
issues
government
does
tell
taxidrivers
exactly
what
they
can
charge
but
not
the
bus
lines
or
the
lawyers
just
as
it
is
not
desireable
to
decide
rights
of
free
speech
on
a
casebycase
basis
we
should
not
decide
rights
to
free
enterprise
on
a
casebycase
basis
there
is
hope
that
a
government
can
be
restricted
from
interferring
with
free
enterprise
but
there
is
no
hope
in
my
opinion
of
having
a
government
that
interferes
with
free
enterprise
in
an
efficient
manner
i
call
it
political
market
failure
thus
if
you
value
freedom
and
the
abundance
it
produces
you
have
to
swallow
the
whole
libertarian
agenda

the

shows
about

and
percent
considered

actually
what
the

shows
is
that
percent
of
the

surveyed
said
they
engaged
in

and
percent
said
they

the
point

that
what

what

may
be
different
it
is
interesting
that
this

did
not

maybe
it
is
conservative

the

anything
merely
pointing
out
that
teds
assertion
that
the
blip
in

was
caused
by

to

the

cant
be
proven
as
ted
notes
not
everyone
is
a
longterm
investor
one
might
find
oneself
as
i
did
in
late
anticipating
expenses
in
the
near

that
require
selling
off

given
the
choice
between
waiting
a
few
weeks

taking
an
extra

hit
or
selling

with

treatment
only
a
fool
would
choose
the
former
not
disputed
the
fact
that
brett
can
now
construct
post
hoc
calculations
of
what
would
have
been
more
beneficial
to
investors
is
in
many
respects
beside
the
point
there
was
plenty
of
moneystyle
advice
given
to
unsophisticated
investors
in
late
to
sell
now
and
save
on
taxes
in
case
anyone
missed
it
there
was
no
shortage
of
similar
advice
late
last
year
in
the
nytimes
eg
even
though
that
advice
was
based
not
on
the
foregone
conclusion
of
enacted
law
as
in
but
merely
on
the
assumption
that
clinton
would
raise
tax
rates
without
capping
cg
taxes
contrary
to
the
current
proposal
it
works
for
any
situation
if
you
believe
the
market
is
going
up
dont
sell
if
believe
its
not
sell
but
then
youd
be
selling
anyways
wouldnt
you
so
where
is
the
evidence
that
a
large
number
of
people
suddenly
decided
that
the
higher
taxes
meant
they
should
sell
before
the
year
was
out
there
isnt
any
teds
saying
that
the
increase
over
the
previous
year
is
proof
of
that
proposition
but
im
saying
you
cant
know
that
the
trend
of
increasing
capital
gains
revenues
wouldnt
account
for
a
lot
of
that
increase
was
the
height
of
the

remember

most

deplored

why
dont
the
republicans
get
their
act
together
and
say
they
will
support
a
broadbased
vat
that
would
have
to
be
visible
the
vat
in
canada
is
visible
unlike
the
invisible
vats
they
have
in
europe
and
suggest
a
rate
sufficient
to
halve
income
and
corporate
and
capital
gains
tax
rates
and
at
a
rate
sufficient
to
give
the
clintons
enough
revenue
for
their
health
care
reform
the
republicans
are
in
general
fighting
any
tax
increase
there
is
also
worry
that
a
vat
would
be
far
too
easy
to
increase
incrementally
btw
what
is
different
between
canadas
tax
and
most
of
europes
that
makes
it
visible
and
force
an
agreement
with
the
democrats
that
the
top
income
tax
rate
would
then
be
frozen
for
the
forseeable
future
and
could
be
increased
only
via
a
national
referendum
this
would
require
a
constitutional
amendment
and
congress
enjoys
raising
taxes
too
much
to
restrict
themselves
like
that
besides
with
the
majority
necessary
to
pull
that
off
youd
have
a
difficult
time
forcing
anything
like
that
why
not
make
use
of
the
clintons
to
do
something
worthwhile
shift
the
tax
burden
from
investment
to
consumption
and
get
health
care
reform
and
a
frozen
low
top
marginal
tax
rate
all
in
one
fell
swoop
primarily
because
its
a
practical
impossibility
to
freeze
tax
rates
however
this
is
something
that
bothers
me
were
always
talking
about
consumer
confidence
and
consumer
spending
as
gauges
for
the
economy
if
they
really
are

wouldnt
shifting

provide

exactly
what
i
wrotethe

of
the

is
wholly
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
current
state
of

absolutely
so
the
response
of

is
take
us
even
further
into

duh
what
else
would
you
expect
a

to
do

no
your

utterly
dominated

now
my
subculture
my
were
getting
personal
the
only
subculture
i
see
dominating
the

industries
is
money
if
youll
buy
it
theyll
sell
it
and
as
recent
movements
to
boycott
tv
advertisers
have
shown
theyre
very
sensitive
about
what
sells
whatever
happened
to
personal
responsibility
anyway
or
am
i
personally
responsible
for
the
decline
in
that
too
to
the
extent
that
people
have
been
encouraged
to
not
be
responsible
for
themselves
yes
a
just
when
and
where
have
i
encouraged
people
not
to
be
responsible
for
themselves
be
specificbut
do
make
up
random
dates
and
heinous
acts
as
you
see
fit
b
you
and
i
have
encouraged
many
people
to
do
many
things
how
does
that
in
any
way
make
our
audiences
less
responsible
for
their
actions
is
there
a
finite
amount
of
responsibility
so
cf
conservation
of
energy
as
i
become
more
responsible
for
an
occurrence
by
encouraging
it
the
actual
perpetrator
becomes
correspondingly
less
so
at
what
point
does
the
perpetrator
become
completely
innocent
altogether
you
know
this
lends
a
whole
new
meaning
to
the

the

oddly
enough

very
flawed
imho
source

information
to
pass
jusgement
on
all
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
only
the
most
comprehensive
survey
on
sexuality
in
years
it
would
seem
more
logical
to
say
that
since
the
heterosexual
group
of
men
is
larger
then
the
chances
of
promiscuity
larger
as
well
in
my
opinion
orientation
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
chance
and
size
have
nothing
in
common
on
the
multimillion

scale
we
are
talking
about
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the

man
before
that
i
was

so
whose
promiscuous
nobody
said
that
you
were
chill
just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt
mean
they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is

doesnt

they
do
look

heard
a

going

on

about
how
dishonest
it
was
that
the

were
taking
items
from
this

in

to
ridicule
this

now
that

is
using

in

garner

for

are
you

going

do
the
honorable
thing
and
say
that
clinton
is
being
dishonest
as
one
of
the
clintonites
cited
above
ill
try
to
clarify
since
this
is
not
a
case
of
clintons
dishonesty
i
wont
necessarily
defend
him
on
other
issues
there
were
never
any
specific
projects
included
in
the
community
development
block
grant
portion
of
the
presidents
proposal
congressional
republicans
in
an
effort
to
discredit
the
stimulus
package
selected
what
they
felt
were
silly
sounding
projects
from
a
wishlist
of
potential
projects
prepared
by
the
us
mayors
conference
before
the
stimulus
package
was
ever
proposed
the
document
in
question
was
designed
to
pressure
the
white
house
to
increase
the
size
of
the
block
grant
proposal
submitted
to
congress
it
didnt
work
the
billion
proposed
in
the
stimulus
package
came
nowhere
close
to
covering
the
total
estimated
cost
of
the
original
wishlist
if
it
were
passed
communities
would
have
to
select
which
projects
to
fund
and
at
what
level
in
the
case
of
spokane
wa
tom
foleys
home
district
no
one
ever
expected
to
be
able
to
refurbish
a
local
swimming
pool
one
of
the
republicans
examples
from
the
funds
available
in
the
stimulus
package
since
the
estimated
cost
of
doing
so
exceeded
the
total
amount
of
block
grant
funds
the
city
would
receive
from
the
stimulus
package
for
all
projects
the
plan
instead
was
to
use
the
money
on
public
housing
construction
and
remodeling
to
cope
with
a
severe
housing
shortage
yup
there
are
places
where
that
is
true
the
swimming
pool
improvements
were
near
the
bottom
of
a
long
list
of
priorities
prepared
by
the
city
the
million
or
so
to
be
received
would
cover
only
a
few
of
the
most
pressing
priorities
if
the
block
grants
are
cut
from
the
stimulus
package
it
is
these
projects
that
will
be
affected
by
the
lack
of
funds
and
that
is
why
the
clinton
administration
has
been
publicizing
the
issue
a
final
point
one
may
or
may
not
like
community
block
grants
it
is
worth
noting
however
that
congressional
republicans
opposition
to
them
is
new
since
the
nixon
administration
republicans
have
generally
supported
such
grants
as
an
alternative
to
targeted
federal
spending
arguing
that
local
governments
are
far
better
able
to
determine
spending
priorities
than
washington
bureaucrats
is
it

in

fire
appeared

a

then
theres

nagging

about
why
out

only
a

made
any
attempts

escape

save
the

if
it

i
believe
i
would
have
made
some
attempt

at

save
the

as
it
was
at

one
of
the

was
attempting
to
go
back

were
physically
removed
no

lifted
a

how
do
you

claimed

have
doused
the

oil

set
the

no

on

at

until
the

talked

also
why
have
they

my

after

brought
up
the

that
it
would
enable
more
people
to
vote
however
since
it
makes
it
easier
to
get
to
the
place
of

he
brought
up
the
analogy
that
if
there
were
only
one
place
to
vote
say
in
alaska
would
it
be
excessive
and
wasteful
to
petition
to
have
more
places
to
vote
this
is
a
similar
idea
a
way
to
encourage
more
people
to
vote
by
making
it
more
easily
accessible
i
not
knowing
where
i
stood
played
devils
advocate
and
said
well
would
you
have
the
taxpayers
money
go
to
busing
for
those
people
that
have
trouble
making
it
to
dmv
then
where
does
the
right
to
vote
merge
with
the
right
to
vote
easily
where
should
we
draw
the
lines
well
there
does
have
to
be
a
line
and
to
be
honest
extending
voter
registration
to
dmvs
is
hardly
analogous
to
having
only
one
place
for
registration
in
alaska
and
opening
a
new
one
in
atlanta
more
is
not
always
better
once
youve
passed
a
certain
point
my
friend
said
that
that
is
obviously
an
extreme
and
that
actually
the
motorvoter
bill
would
save
money
because
no
longer
would
the
city
have
to
pay
someone
to
sit
in
the
town
hall
and
spend
all
hisher
time
filing
those
things
theyd
just
be
at
the
push
of
a
button
or
the
filling
out
of
an
x
at
dmv
so
i
actually
someone
else
but
theres
no
need
to
confuse
this
anymore
countered
again
saying
that
wouldnt
congress
as
always
get
exorbitent
budgets
and
fund
committees
to
orchestrate
and
oversee
the
implementation
the
argument
went
back
and
forth
forever
ranging
from
whether
or
not
its
better
to
have
more
people
voting
whether
that
is
even
relevant
etc
just
looking
for
some
more
opinions
anybody
got
em
i
thought
the
motor
voter
bill
passed
in
any
case
my
experiance
with
tennessees
voter
registration
system
which
you
can
register
with
by
mail
by
the
way
is
that
nobody
who
is
interested
in
voting
is
being
denied
access
to
registration
all
it
requires
is
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
interest
on
the
registrants
part
and
thinking
about
the
election
once
in
the
eleven
months
prior
to
it
once
you
register
its
good
unless
you
miss
for

since
the
members
of
the
european
parliament
the
parliamentary
assemby
of
the
european
community
have
been
elected
directly
by
the
citizens
of
the
member
states
before
the
members
of
the
european
parliament
meps
were
just
members
of
national
parliaments
mnps
elected
by
and
from
among
their
peers
in
the
european
parliament
every
member
state
has
a
fixed
number
of
seats
which
increases
less
than
proportionally
with
the
population
once
in
five
years
a
general
european
election
is
being
held
in
which
the
citizens
of
all
member
states
choose
their
representatives
to
the
european
parliament
next
elections
are
due
in
now
the
voting
system
for
these
european
elections
still
differs
from
one
country
to
another
although
the
european
treaty
enabling
the
direct
election
of
the
meps
requires
a
uniform
voting
system
up
to
now
every
country
has
just
used
its
own
system
more
or
less
the
same
one
used
for
national
elections
british
meps
are
elected
in
a
firstpastthepost
system
with
one
mep
per
district
nearly
all
other
states
have
chosen
a
system
with
proportional
representation
but
then
in
some
countries
france
italy
meps
are
allowed
to
be
a

as
well
whilst
in
others
they
are
not
belgium
netherlands
the
european
parliament
is
now
working
on
a
uniform
election
system
for
its
own
members
so
that
every
candidate
should
have
the
same
regulations
to
comply
with
regardless
of
the
member
state
she
wants
to
be
elected
for
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
people
out
there
think
of
the
following
questions
do
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
have
uniform
regulations
or
should
every
member
state
continue
to
use
its
own
regulations
for
european
elections
that
is
do
you
think
a
system
of
majority
voting
should
be
implemented
with
one
or
more
meps
per
district
or
would
you
prefer
a
system
with
proportional
representation
for
the
whole
of
the
community
or
per
state
per
region
per
district
do
you
think
the
european

just
its

should
be
directly
elected
too
or
should
it
be
appointed
by
the
european
parliament
or
by
the
joint
member
state
governments
as
it
is
now
the
maastricht
treaty
allows
subjects
of
member
states
to
stand
for
election
in
another
member
state
they
are
residing

do
you
think
you
would
or
could
vote
for
a
foreigner
if
hisher
ideas
appeal
to
you
do
you
think
meps
should
be
allowed
to
be
a
member
of
a
national
parliament
or
a
regional
parliament
too
or
a
member
of
a
national
or
regional
government
body
the
european
parliament
now
has
meetings
in
both
strasbourg
and
brussels
meps
themselves
are
for
a
complete
move
to
brussels
in
great
majority
but
political
compromises
between
the
governments
of
the
member
states
stick
to
the
status
quo
do
you
approve
of
this
or
do
you

should
meet
in

city

i
ask
this
question
because
there
is
a
tradition
and
one
that
is
highly
regarded
by
many
people
that
several
hundred
jews
elected
to
throw
themselves
off
a
cliff
at
masada
rather
than
submit
to
roman
rule
the
circumstances
at
masada
and
those
at
waco
would
seem
in
general
terms
quite
similar
and
yet
so
far
as
im
aware
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
the
jews
were
insane
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
jews
faced
a
totally
different
fate
at
the
hand
of
the
romans
than
did
koresh
at
the
hand
of
the
feds
the
jewish
men
would
most
likely
have
been
crucified
the
the
women
and
children
sold
into
slavery
one
can
well
argue
that
koresh
may
have
thought
that
a
similar
fate
awaited
him
but
there
was
scant
rational
basis
for
that
fear
so
insane
seems
to
describe
any
such
belief
what
is
the
penalty
if
convicted
of
murdering
federal
agents
in
texas
the
death
penalty
none
of
which
excuses
the
reckless
action
of
the
feds
who
allegedly
believing
they
were
dealing
with
a
nut
should
have
exercise
much
more
restraint
indeed
given
their
stated
goals
of
saving
the
children
one
might
also
apply
the
moniker
insane
to
the

i

he
wouldnt

can
claim

without

of
the
fire
its
fairly
simple
it
was
decided
to
burn
the
place
down
and
more
than
one
agent
was
dispatched
to
set
the
fires
in
separate
parts
of
the
compound
i
doubt
that
simultaneously
means
at
the
exact
same
time
in
this
case
it
likely
means
close
enough
together
to
preclude
them
from
being
part
of
the
same
fire
the
fbi
claims
that
men
with
torches
set
the
fires
but
havent
released
any
evidence
of
this
though
it
seems
inconcievable
that
they
dont
have
any
if
it
was
true
they
might
be
waiting
until
the
evidence
comes
in
from
the
site
and
the
investigation
is
at
least
well
underway
all
of
the
bds
previous
actions
were
aimed
towards
their
survival
not
their
death
the
same
could
be
said
of
jonestown
the
idea
that
kerosene
lamps
would
be
all
over
the
place
with
electricity
cut
off
makes
sense
the
idea
that
ramming
tanks
into
the
building
would
spill
them
and
cause
a
fire
makes
sense
the
possibility
that
the
fbi
wouldnt
know
this
is
nil
it
wasnt
simple
negligence
maybe
then
again
ive
been
suprised
at

that

the

the

it
otherwise
try

as

it

are
you

it

that
prevents
private

from

in

it

that
some
of
the

stems
from
the
lack
of

among

private

its

that
you
did
greg
hennessy
university
of
virginia
it
is
obvious
that
mr
cramer
has
the
ability
to
take
the
leap
of
faith
i
have
listened
to
several
of
the
men
involved
in
this
study
and
even
they
claim
that
the
men
involved
will
not
tell
the
whole
truth
i
put
little
value
in
extrapolating
from
these
types
of
studies
or
surveys
they
have
limited
subsets
of
individuals
and
there
is
alot
of
skewing
due
to
improper
selection
methods
and
the
bias
of
the
people
involved
in
the
studies
on
both
sides
subject
and
researcher
would
you
admit
to
be
part
of
a
group
that
was
not
very
well
liked
would
you
admit
to
having
had
sex
with
other
people
at
some
considered
abnormal
rate
this
applies
to
heterosexual
men
in
fact
as
one
gay
man
and
one
straight
man
put
it
men
lie
about
the
number
of
partners
because
thats
the
thing
to
do
our
culture
for
the
male
almost
requires
this
type
of
response
it
may
seem
harmless
and
silly
but
carries
a
large
emotional
and
mental
price
tag
i
hear
college
male
students
everyday
talking
about
their
supposed
conquest
they
just
have
to
look
good
to
one
another
at

in
their
eyes
but
also
know
that
alot
of
this
does
go
on

are

without

there

the

they

newer

hint
that
it
might

less
than

of

then
theres
the
other
side
an
article
in
yesterdays
atlanta
journal
stated
that
there
are
many
scientists
who
have
misgivings
that
the
data
being
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
global
warming
is
occuring
is
faulty
the
point
that
the
article
made
is
that
all
long
term
temperature
dataa
collected
has
been
in
urban
areas
and
that
any
heat
rise
can
be
attributed
to
the
growth
and
urbanization
of
the
area
they
called
it
the
asphalt
temperature
trend
we
have
no
real
long

data
on
remote

such
as
the
middle
of
the
amazon
rain
forest
or
the
top
of
mt
everest
or
the

for
that
matter
an
accompanying
article
mentioned
that
a
group
of
scientists
at
nasa
had
developed
a
method
for
using
a
satellite
to
collect
temperature
data
globally
and
that
preliminary
results
showed
a
slight
downward
trend
attributed
to
the
mt
pinatubo
eruption
it
went
on
to
say
that
even
with
the
current
downward
trend
there
appeared
to
be
no

it

actions
in

of
that
end
that
he

for
you
of

are
so
ignorant

that
you
think
that
he
was
involved
in
the
break
in
i
guess
that
makes
you
even
dumber
than
me
then
because
he
was
officially
accused
of
alot
more
than
that
let
me
list
it
for
you
obstructing
justice
as
part
of
the
coverup
granted
abusing
his
presidential
powers
to
do
the

only
in
part
lets
not

that
nixon
personally
authorized
the
breakin
of

psychiatrist
subverting

i
challenge
you
to
provided
any
evidence
that
nicon
was
officially
accused

thi
if
nothing
else
its
meaningless
how
can
you
subvert
someones
constitutional

the
verb
doesnt
go
with
the
noun
tell
that
to
the

that
was
the
charge
or
are
you
going

challenge
me
on
that
as
well
subverting
the
constitutional

of

has
nothing
to
do
with
coveringup
for
watergate
you
have
been
proved
wrong
again
but
i
dont
expect
you
to
believe
this
since
your
arrogance
has
replaced
your
reason
and
willfully
disobeying
lawful
subpoenas

part

granted
garrett
please
note
that
every
charge
you
mention

for
the
one
that
has
no
english

was
part

wrong
again
you
forgot
about

btw
why
od
you
think
he
tried
to
cover
it
up
loyalty
to
people
who
worked
for
him
this
would
be
funny
if
it
werent
so
sad
that
you
actually
believe
this
in
his
loyalty
he
allowed
the
people
who
worked
for
him
to
take
the
rap
while
he
idly
sat
by
and
let
it
happen
if

he

since
you
all

the

anyway
one
of
you
said
nixon
didnt

any
secret
wars
this
is
a
lie
nixon
had
full
knowledge
of
the
invasions
of
laos
and
cambodia
and
then
lied
to
the
american
public
about
it
note
however
that
these
were
military
actions
but
not
wars
what
a
joke
you
cant
actually
believe
what
you
just
said
can
you
we
bombed
and
invaded
these
countries
notice
the
definition
of
war
from
the
american
heritage
dictionary
a
state
or
period
of
armed
conflict
between
nations
or
states
this
qualifies
the
invasions
of
cambodia
and
laos
as
wars
one
of
you
said
nixon
didnt
use
the
office
of
the
presidency
for
personal
gain
this
is
a
lie
the
senate
committee
issued
an
indictment
that
listed
nixons
crimes
the
relevant
ones
were
violating
his
oath
of
office
abusing
his
presidential
powers
excuse
me
but
neither
of
these
refer
to
personal
gain
then
let
me
explain
this
to
you
really
slowly
why
did
he
abuse
the
powers
of
his
position
could
it
have
been
to
gain
personal
political
power
naw
that
would
be
too
obvious
so
now
youre
big
thing
that
you
have
been
flogging
me
with
is
that
i
mistook
prc
for
peoples
republic
of
cambodia
since
i
knew
that
cambodia
was
socialist
at
the
time
and
since
your
comment
was
right
in
middle
of
a
conversation
about
cambodia
i
made
the
wrong
assumption
that
we
were
talking
about
the
same
thing
ah
but
garrett
anyone
who
has
to
make
assumptions
about
the
meaning
of
the
initials
prc
in
a
discussion
about
asia
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
anyone
who
can
only
call
names
because
his
position
is
defensless
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
desperate
i
noticed
that
you
edited
out
the
other
points
were
i
proved
you
and
phil
to
be
completely
wrong
death
to
all

he

are

they
raided

property
because
of
rumors
about
koreshs
intentions
with
some
converted
yet
still
protected
firearms
a
judgeapproved
warrant
justifies
nothing
in
a
democracy
under
the
rule
of
law
a
search
warrant
justifies
a

the

constitution
does
not
justify
murder
of
those
attempting

mount
a

for
illegally
held
weapons
a
search
for
illegally
held
weapons
if
there
were
any
no
evidence
yet
produced
to
this
effect
does
not
justify
firing
into
a
house
with
women
and
children
either
it
also
does
not
justify
shooting
first
without
identifying
oneself
the
atf
and
fbi
have
done
this
before
so
dont
say
they
havent
please
or
producing
a
warrant
guess
it
depends
on
whose
story
one
believes
huh
it
took
them
days
to
think
of
a
basic
terrorist
tactic
ie
tear
gas
and
this
could
only
be
justified
in
support
of
rescuing
any
supposed
hostages
inside
the
govt
has
a
right
to
use
lethal
force
in
certain
cases
attempts
to
capture
dangerous
criminals
who
are
armed
and
threatening
the
lives
of
others
which
others
are
we
talking
about
here
is
one
in
this
case
they
used
sub
lethal
force
sub
lethal
excuse
me
but
those
people
are
dead
the
govt
immediately
imprisoned
these
socalled
hostages
the
children
were
held
hostage
evidence
so
far
the
fbi
has
produced
none
dont
hold
your
breath
the
adults
were
wanted
variously
for
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
only
a
few
of
those
being
held
in
chains
and
shackles
are
wanted
the
rest
are
being
held
for
the
crime
of
being
material
witnesses
it
took
hundreds
of
govt
agents
with
taxfunded
cellular
phones
ten
minutes
to
dial
for
the
fire
department
they
should
not
have
called
the
fire
dept
at
all
there
was
no
role
for
them
to
play
in
a
situation
where
those
that
might
be
rescued
might
well
shoot
at
them
it
was
not
the
feds
decision
to
make
but
the
firefighters
calling
the
fire
dept
meant
that
waco
was
deprived
of
a
resource
that
might
have
been
needed
elsewhere
should
a
situation
where
it
could
have
been
used
arisen
this
is
true
of
any
answer
to
a
call
for
help
from
a
fire
department
by
any
citizen
since
fire
departments
do
answer
calls
that
deprive
resources
that
might
be
needed
elsewhere
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
for
not
calling
them
further
since
the
davidians
had
not
been
found
guilty
of
any
crime
in
a
court
of
law
they
are
subject
to
the
same
protection
as
any
other
citizen
and
las
far
as
i
know
even
criminals
in
prison
are
not
left
to
burn
to
death
in
a
fire
by
cutting
off
the
water
supply
in
the
surrounding
area
the
govt
guaranteed
that
any
fire
at
the
compound
would
be
fatal
any
fire
started
deliberately
uising
lamp
oil
is
likely
to
be
fatal
i
guess
this
is
a
matter
of
religious
faith
with
you
the
government
says
it
so
it
must
be
so
or
havent
you
been
reading
this
thread
well
enough
to
notice
that
some
of
us
here
dont
beleive
their
story
no
one
had
the
foresight
to
station
rescue
vehicles
nearby
in
the
first
place
they
are
a
scarce
resource
a
bunch
of
psychos
cannot
deprive
the
neighbourhood
of
a
resource
that
might
be
required
in
a
genuine
case
patients
in
psychiatric
hospitals
are
not
left
to
die
in
fires
either
besides
as
i
explained
some
of
us
here
believe
their
distress
might
have
been
genuine
are
you
so
certain
it
wasnt
the
govt
conveniently
forgot
all
that
freedom
of
religion
stuff
freedom
of
religion
does
not
include
human
sacrifice
nor
does
it
include
other
forms
of
murder
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
davidians
committed
human
sacrifice
either
before
of
after
the
initial
raid
and
selfdefense
is
not
murder
the
govt
arguably
started
or
at
least
fanned
the
fire
themselves
the
govt
arguably
is
run
by
communists
or
the
trilateral
commission
he
did
not
say
it
was
deliberate
accidents
do
not
require
conspiracy
theories
only
wanton
disregard
for
human
life
the
initial
raid
alone
agents
firing
blind
into
walls
against
all
standards
of
law
enforce
ment
procedure
proves
they
did
not
mind
killing
people
finally
and
this
may
be
a
stretch
for
some
of
you
statists
out
there
but
koreshs
original
reasons
for
holing
up
in
such
a
compound
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
continual
interference
from
the
govt
new
taxes
new
regulations
and
increasing
involvement
in
every
aspect
of
our
personal
and
economic
lives
life
on
a
compound
might
become
the
way
of
the
future
it
might
have
to
be
let
us
hope
that
those
who
support
koresh
are
not
allowed
to
enforce
this
upon
the
rest
of
us
no
one
here
is
supporting
koresh
we
are
opposing
the
illegal
use
of
excessive
violence
by
our
government
against
our
citizens
that
is
all
their
reasons
for
supporting
the
ownership
of
high
power
weaponry
are
clear
enough
they
hope
that
this
will
be
the
catylist
for
the
destruction
of
the
fabric
of
society
and
allow
them
to
enforce
their
nightmare
vision
of
the
future
a
society
that
believes
it
is
ok
to
terrorize
people
for
their
religious
views
will
destroy
itself
in
due
time
it
is
the
feds
who
disrupted
the
fabric
of
society
in
waco
not
koresh
it
is
the
feds
who
forced
a
nightmare
onto
the
people
of
mount
carmel
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
people
to
study
history
on
what
basis
do
you
assume
we
havent
dont
you
really
mean
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
people
drew
the

conclusions
from
history
that
i

a

militant

the

their

religious

who
left
to
set
up
such

some

a

latter
they
had
captured

and
destroyed
the

in
the

within
ten
years
the
whole
of

was

so
what
the
mormons
were
considered
a
cult
for
years
and
were
chased
out
of
one
place
after
another
on
much
the
same
thinking
as
you
are
advocating
when
they
finally
got
to
set
up
a
community
they
left
people
alone
so
far

havent

just

a

of
people
start
by
saying
that
all
they
want
is
to
be
left
alone
does
not
mean
that
that
is
how
they
will
stay
it
doesnt
mean
they
wont
either
anyway
the
whole
purpose
of

of

is
to
punish
people
for

do

hasnt
gotten

killed
if
you
allow
such

to
get
guns
and
point
them
in

you
are
likely
to
find
that
they
are
running
your

right
now
the
only
people
sticking

is

writes
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
branch
davidian
people
immolated
themselves
in
the
manner
described
by
the
federal
authorities
why
does
the
general
consensus
appear
to
be
that
they
the
bd
were
insane
is
it
the
manner
of
their
behaviour
before
they
died
or
the
fact
they
chose
to
kill
themselves
rather
than
submit
to
the
government
i
ask
this
question
because
there
is
a
tradition
and
one
that
is
highly
regarded
by
many
people
that
several
hundred
jews
elected
to
throw
themselves
off
a
cliff
at
masada
rather
than
submit
to
roman
rule
the
circumstances
at
masada
and
those
at
waco
would
seem
in
general
terms
quite
similar
and
yet
so
far
as
im
aware
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
the
jews
were
insane
the
point
of
this
comparison
is
to
question
the
use
of
the
word
cult
in
discussing
the
events
at
waco
why
were
the
davidians
a
cult
and
not
the
jews
at
masada
what
constitutes
a
cult
is
it
the
size
of
the
membership
or
a
matter
of
respectability
or
perhaps
the
length
of
time
its
been
in
existence
are
the
catholics
a
cult
how
about
the
mormons
or
the
calvinists
is
a
sect
a
respectible
cult
dictionary
definitions
aside
since
popular
usage
seems
to
carry
more
weight
i
suspect
that
the
word
cult
is
used
in
a
perjorive
sense
when
speaking
of
groups
like
the
davidians
it
is
rather
like
the
word
boss
when
used
to
describe
someone
unpopular
or
someone
the
government
wishes
to
make
unpopular
like
say
castro
the
communist
boss
of
cuba
one
doesnt
hear
clinton
described
as
americas
democratic
or
capitalist
boss
well
for
one
thing
most
if
not
all
the
dividians
depending
on
whether
they
could
show
they
acted
in
selfdefense
and
there
were
no
illegal
weapons
could
have
gone
on
with
their
life
as
they
were
living
it
no
one
was
forcing
them
to
give
up
their
religion
or
even
their
legal
weapons
the
dividians
had
survived
a
change
in
leadership
before
so
even
if
koresch
himself
would
have
been
convicted
and
sent
to
jail
they
still
could
have
carried
on
i
dont
think
the
dividians
were
insane
but
i
dont
see
a
reason
for
mass
suicide
if
the
fire
was
intentional
set
by
some
of
the
dividians
we
also
dont
know
that
if
the
fire
was
intentionally
set
from
inside
was
it
a
generally
know
plan
or
was
this
something
only
an

was
it
something
two

i

missing
the
entire
point
of
my
post
wrote
given
that
the
trade
in
illegal
drugs
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
which
afflicts
our
nation
there
is
much
evidence
that
it
is
the
fact
that
the
drugs
are
illegal
not
the
drugs
themselves
that
have
caused
the
violence
witness
prohibition
and
the
violence
that
surrounded
the
trade
in
alcohol
no
joke
people
who
want
drugs
particularly
people
who
are
predisposed
to
addiction
will
find
a
way
to
get
them
whether
or
not
they
are
legally
available
this
is
suppossed
to
be
an
argument
for

noyoujumped

its
actually
an

as
to
how
to
accomplish
the
societal
good
of
discouraging
drug
use
without
violating
individual
rights
despite
current
law
enforcement
efforts
drugs
are
readily

to
those
who

them
this

no
youmissed
the
point
the
point
is
the
war
on
drugs
is
a
failure
and
is
counterproductive
addiction
to
drugs
boh
legal
and
illegal
is
responsible
for
a
significant
drain
on
the
productive
resources
of
our
country
and
this
occurs
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
the
cocaineaddicted
babies
who
are
unable
to
learn
to
the
spread
of
disease
among
addicts
to
the
tragic
consequences
of
alcohol
abuse
and
tobacco
smoking
the
crack
baby
scenario
has
been
thouroughly
discredited
it
just
so
happens
that
the
symptoms
seen
in
the
crack
babies
are
identical
to
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
and
the
mothers
who
admitted
to
taking
crack
also
admitted
to
drinking
heavily
during
pregnancy
in
this
country
people
are
free
to
be
stupid
if
they
want
to
but
they
are
not
free
to
be
stupid
and
injure
other
people
admittedly
the
fetal
righttolife
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
discussion
however
its
ridiculous
to
assert
as
you
apparently
do
that
cocaine
hasno
effecton
the
developing
fetal
nervous
system
caffiene
and
nicotine
have
fetal
effects
too
why
should
cocaine
be
any
exception
a
general
economic
principle
of
government
is
that
whatever
is
subsidized
you
get
more
of
and
whatever
is
taxed
you
get
less
of
to
be
most
effective
in
confronting
the
nations
drug
problem
some
way
must
be
found
to
utilize
these
additional
powers
of
government
to
make
drug
dealing
and
drug
use
less
attractive
so
make
the
drugs
legal
tax
them
and
use
the
tax
money
to
fund
a
program
to
tell
people
how
studid
drugs
are
it
has
worked
for
the
legal
drugs
if
you
had
read
my
article
before
writing
your
kneejerk
response
you
would
have
seen
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
advocated
while
this
countrys
current
efforts
to
combat
legal
drugs
have
succeeded
in
some
respects
there
is
a
greater
awareness
of
the
health
consequences
of
smoking
and
designateddriver
programs
have
helped
reduce
drunk
driving
for
example
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
war
on
illegal
drugs
there
remains
a
core
group
of
illegal
drug
users
which
support
international
networks
of
smugglers
pushers
growers
processors
kingpins
and
gangsters
these
networks
and
their
marketing
activities
which
include
drive
by
shootings
corrupting
law
enforcement
authorities
and
smuggling
weapons
are
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
crimes
committed
in
our
country
every
day
each
and
every
one
of
these
problems
is
a
direct
result
of
the
drug
trade
being
illegal
no
shit
sherlock
clearly
illegal
drugs
and
rising
crime
are
linked
it
takes
only
a
moments
reflection
to
recognize
how
they
are
linked
the
link
is
money
as
with
this
countrys
failed
effort
to
prohibit
alcohol
consumption
a
black
market
has
been
created
in
which
greedy
local
monopolies
like
the
gangsters
of
a
bygone
era
have
profited
enormously
from
their
illegal
trade
the
victims
of
this
trade
include
not
only
the
innocent
people
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
in
the
crossfire
but
i
would
argue
the
drug
users
themselves
a
great
argument
for
making
drugs
legal
thank
you
how
could
you
have
missed
the
point
so
utterly
whathaveyou
been
smoking
here
then
is
my
proposal
possession
and
use
of
all
presently
illegal
drugs
is
decriminalized
but
buying
and
selling
them
remains
illegal
potheads
can
grow
their
own
marijuana
as
many
already
do
today
other
drug
users
can
legally
import
their
poison
of
choice
as
long
as
they
pay
the
tariffs
and
a
barter
economy
of
drug
experimenters
develops
your
solution
has
done
nothing
to
eliminate
the
violence
in
the
drug
trade
btw
how
is
someone
going
to
import
a
drug
if
buying
it
is
illegal
i
think
you
need
to
think
your
solution
through
a
little
more
thouroughly
obviously
importers
will
not
be
buying
drugs
in
the
us
under
us
jurisdiction
use
your
remaining
brain
cells
because
of
the
barter
economy
which
supplies
the
drug
users
the
black
market
profits
that
have
so
enriched
the
drug
lords
dwindle
if
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
why
buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommercial
drugs
even
at
relatively
low
prices
therefore
you
have
failed
to
indicate
how
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
you
have
stated
that
the
sale
of
them
is
illegal
ok
ill
spell
it
out
for
you
barter
economy
means
that
drug
users
will
be
permitted
to
grow
or
synthesize
chemically
anything
they
choose
or
to
buy
it
outside
the
us
and
bring
it
in
if
it
wont
grow
here
they
will
also
be
permitted
to
trade
with
other
drug
users
for
drugs
other
than
the
ones
they
themselves
grow
or
manufacture
they
will
not
however
be
able
to
legally
sell
their
drugs
for
money
both
manufacture
and
importation
of
noncommercial
drugs
will
be
taxed
to
discourage
their
use
this
is
your
brain
on
drugs
any
questions
law
enforcement
activity
is
concentrated
on
those
individuals
who
continue
to
buy
and
sell
and
also
on
the
crimes
committed
by
drug
users
too
poor
to
afford
even
low
prices
but
here
is
where
the
strategy
begins
to
differentiate
between
the
drug
dealers
the
victimizers
and
the
drug
users
their
victims
in
most
cities
this
is
already
the
strategy
it
has
already
failed
and
is
dragging
the
rest
of
us
down
with
it
pardon
me
but
possessionuse
of
these
drugs
is
still
a
crime
you
cannot
analogize
the
rates
at
which
drug
users
would
seek
treatment
and
the
comparative
ease
with
which
it
could
be
made
available
today
when
these
drugs
are
illegal
to
possessuse
with
what
it
would
be
were
theynotillegal
to
possessuse
decriminalizing
possession
and
use
makes
treatmentmucheasier
drug
dealers
are
exploiting
the
weaknesses
of
those
persons
who
are
prone
to
addiction
and
as
such
the
drug
users
should
be
left
alone
not
thrown
in
prison
along
with
their
victimizers
drugdealersare
the
criminals
and
should
be
treated
as
such
drug
addiction
does
not
absolve
you
of
responsiblity
for
your
criminal
actions
however
upon
arrest
foranycrimesuspects
are
permitted
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
will
undergo
a
drug
test
those
who
choose
to
cooperate
are
informed
that
upon
conviction
for
the
crime
they
are
accused
of
if
they
are
found
to
be
a
drug
user
they
will
be
institutionalized
until
they
are
clean
and
only
then
will
they
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
if
they
choose
to
cooperate
and
are
already
drugfree
they
can
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
right
away
those
who
choose
not
to
undergo
the
drug
test
and
are
convicted
face
stiffer
fines
and
serve
longer
sentences
this
sounds
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
self
incrimination
which
is
unconstitutional
if
drug
use
is
legal
in
your
scheme
why
should
the
presence
of
drugs
in
anyones
system
influence
the
penalty
they
receive
much
too
big
brotherish
for
my
tastes
the
drug
test
of
an
arrested
suspect
is
voluntary
not
coerced
and
does
not
therefore
constitute
violation
of
amendment
v
those
convicted
who
are
drug
users
as
evidenced
by
the
test
are
in
need
of
treatment
for
their
problem
institutionalization
of
these
adddicted
criminals
is
i
would
argue
the
best
way
to
help
them
straighten
out
if
they
refuse
the
test
and
are
convicted
their
sentence
can
be
appropriately
harsher
since
they
unlike
the
addict
have
no
excuse
for
their
crimes
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
serves
several
purposes
drug
using
criminals
and
this
includes
drunk
andor
stoned
drivers
are
separated
from
their
sources
of
supply
thus
reducing
the
total
number
of
drug
users
in
society
at
large
and
consequently
decreasing
the
demand
for
drugs
on
the
street
putting
more
of
the
remaining
drug
dealers
out
of
business
why
should
drug
using
criminals
be
treated
any
different
from
other
criminals
you
have
already
stated
that
drug
use
is
legal
markwilsonatlantagancrcom
why
not
my
objective
is
to
discourage
drug
useandcriminal
behavior
if
fewer
criminals
do
drugs
out
of
fear
of
getting
a
harsher
sentence
if
they
are
convicted
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing
if
fewer
drug
dealers
who
are
still
criminals
btw
can
find
victims
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing
if
fewer
drug
users
such
as
drunks
potheads
etc
commit
crimes
out
of
fear
of
being
cut
off
from
their
sources
of
supply
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing

you

your

the

does
read

let
us
not

that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a

carries
no

poor

of
the
most

in

witness
the

make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
just
to
make
sure
youve
got
the
point
lets
do
a
little
experiment
what
if
the
constitution
read
as
follows
preamble
we
the
people
to
promote
the
general
welfare
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
constitution
the
federal
government
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
only
to
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
nation
the
government
would
not
then
have
two
functions
defense
and
welfare
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in
article
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions
right
steve
im
glad
to
see
that
you
abandoned
the
preamble
thing
what
did
you
do
a
word
search
to
find
welfare
somewhere
else
in
the
constitution
my
comments
and
paraphrases
in
brackets
article
i
section
in
some
ways
the
guts
of
the
constitution
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
indebtedness
as
defined
in
the
document
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
defence
as
precisely
defined
and
general
welfare
as
defined
through
the
document
mostly
in
ways
that
limit
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
the
above
taxes
shall
be
uniform
through
out
the
us
so
far
the
congress
has
been
given
the
power
to
collect
taxes
uniformly
then
to
borrow
money
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
interstate
and
indian
tribes
to
do
uniform
naturalization
and
bankruptcies
to
coin
money
regulate
the
value
thereof
and
etc
to
punish
counterfeiters
to
establish
post
offices
and
post
roads
to
provide
patents
and
copyrights
to
constitute

inferior
to
the
supreme

to
define
and
punish
piracies
and
etc
to
declare

and
etc
to
raise
and
support
armiesbut
for
no
longer
than
two
years
at
a
stretch
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy
notice
no
time
limit
on
this
one
to
make
the
rules
for
the
army
and
navy
to
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
etc
to
provide
for
training
of
the

except
for
some
state
stuff
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
in
dc
to
make
all
laws
necessary
to
execute
the
foregoing
powers
your
original
instinct
was
right
looking
to
other
nations
for
precedents
that
support
an
expansive
liberal
agenda
is
much
easier
than
looking
to
the
slim

but
obviously
the
situation
there
is
very
serious
q
has
he
called
janet
reno
today
or
yesterday
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes
spoken
to
her
today
q
why
does
he
have
nothing
to
say
about
this
publicly
except
on
the
piece
of
paper
that
was
put
out
last
night
at
pm
ms
myers
he
did
he
answered
a
question
about
it
yesterday
q
before
anything
had
happened
ms
myers
before
anything
happened
he
put
out
q
since
something
has
happened
hes
had
nothing
to
say
ms
myers
hes
put
out
a
statement
on
it
last
night
and
well
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
today
q
in
what
forum
is
that
going
to
be
ms
myers
it
will
be
at
the
photo
in
the
rose
garden
q
he
will
talk
about
waco
at
that
ms
myers
yes
hell
have
something
to
say
q
is
that
something
we
can
take
live
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
be
brief
we
can
talk
a
little
later
about
the
exact
structure
as
we
work
it
out
but
i
dont
know
if
its
something
youd
want
to
take
live
q
will
he
take
questions
on
waco
at
that
time
as
well
ms
myers
hell
probably
take
a
few
q
is
there
any
reason
why
he
hasnt
talked
to
the
attorney
general
ms
myers
ill
have
to
doublecheck
i
dont
know
that
he
hasnt
talked
to
her
this
morning
q
and
she
didnt
come
here
this
morning
to
see
him
or
anyone
else
ms
myers
no
q
and
he
didnt
talk
yesterday
q
whats
the
reaction
to
her
resignation
statement
that
she
made
last
night
ms
myers
she
was
asked
a
question
about
it
and
she
answered
the
question
the
president
has
absolutely
no
intention
of
asking
for
the
attorney
generals
resignation
he
stands
behind
her
percent
as
you
know
he
was
informed
about
the
decision
he
takes
full
responsibility
for
that
and
stands
percent
behind
attorney
general
reno
q
the
question
now
arises
yesterday
we
were
told
that
he
was
briefed
on
this
but
we
never
got
a
firm
idea
of
how
much
he
knew
of
what
the
plan
was
and
the
justification
for
the
plan
and
the
justification
of
the
timing
was
he
fully
informed
on
all
of
that
all
of
this
about
the
increasing
levels
of
violence
inside
the
compound
that
made
them
want
to
go
now
the
feeling
that
nothing
else
was
going
to
succeed
et
cetera
ms
myers
he
talked
with
the
attorney
general
about
the
decision
about
she
talked
to
him
about
the
factors
that
led
to
her
decision
he
raised
no
objections
he
supports
her
decision
to
go
forward
with
it
he
was
fully
briefed
q
of
course
hindsight
is
but
looking
back
now
does
the
president
does
the
white
house
feel
that
the
decision
he
signed
off
on
proved
to
be
the
right
way
to
go
when
you
look
at
what
actually
happened
ms
myers
i
think
everybody
feels
bad
when
life
is
lost
but
i
dont
think
that
that
is
reason
to
secondguess
the
decision
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
was
made
he
was
informed
about
it
he
was
fully
briefed
about
it
and
he
stands
percent
behind
the
attorney
general
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
its
a
difficult
operation
and
theres
it
had
already
gone
on
for
more
than
seven
weeks
four
federal
agents
had
lost
their
lives
in
the
line
of
duty
lets
not
forget
that
this
was
a
very
difficult
situation
and
all
the
decisions
involved
were
very
difficult
but
all
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
fbi
the
justice
department
all
recommended
moving
forward
with
this
they
thought
given
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
possible
course
of
action
theres
just
no
point
in
second
guessing
those
decisions
now
i
think
that
theres
a
reason
q
why
not
they
have
to
ms
myers
no
not
to
secondguess
the
decisions
i
think
its
important
to
take
a
look
at
it
to
have
an
investigation
i
think
the
president
will
talk
some
about
that
later
today
but
at
this
from
this
vantage
point
to
secondguess
those
decisions
its
not
useful
q
you
sound
like
hes
going
to
order
an
investigation
of
what
happened
and
whether
ms
myers
i
think
hell
have
more
to
say
about
that
later
yes
q
he
will
order
an
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
yes
hell
have
more
to
say
about
an
investigation
q
what
kind
of
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
q
but
in
the
monday
morning
quarterbacking
surely
there
is
some
soulsearching
now
as
to
whether
it
was
the
right
decision
you
cant
say
that
we
did
the
best
we
could
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
rather
a
debacle
ms
myers
i
think
well
obviously
well
review
the
situation
and
all
the
factors
that
lead
to
a
very
tragic
outcome
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
that
the
outcome
was
tragic
but
again
the
president
stands
behind
the
decisions
that
were
made
and
well
take
a
look
at
the
factors
that
contributed
to
that
q
what
was
the
fbi
directors
role
in
this
ms
myers
well
he
was
obviously
involved
in
setting
up
the
operation
he
signed
off
on
it
as
did
the
agents
that
were
on
the
ground
that
were
working
with
him
i
dont
believe
he
spoke
to
the
president
but
ill
doublecheck
that
q
but
he
was
very
closely
involved
in
every
aspect
of
planning
and
so
forth
ms
myers
i
would
refer
you
to
the
fbi
on
exactly
what
aspects
he
was
involved
with
q
will
janet
reno
be
coming
over
to
the
white
house
today
ms
myers
theres
no
planned
meeting
i
dont
believe
that
shell
be
here
q
she
wont
be
at
this
event
at
pm
ms
myers
no
no
plans
to
be
q
do
you
think
that
theres
going
to
be
a
jumping
on
on
the
part
of
political
opposition
to
make
something
out
of
this
in
terms
of
to
the
presidents
detriment
politically
ms
myers
well
i
would
certainly
hope
that
people
wouldnt
try
to
use
this
tragedy
for
political
reasons
obviously
i
think
again
that
its
useful
to
look
at
the
facts
to
reevaluate
the
facts
and
i
think
the
president
will
move
forward
with
that
but
i
think
people
understand
that
this
was
a
difficult
series
of
decisions
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
situation
that
it
was
caused
by
a
man
who
was
a
cult
leader
who
was
involved
in
the
death
of
four
federal
agents
and
i
think
its
most
tragic
that
a
lot
of
innocent
children
lost
their
lives
in
this
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
the
tragedy
of
the
outcome
q
dee
dee
what
was
the
white
house
role
in
handling
the
i
guess
public
relations
aspect
in
the
aftermath
who
was
talking
who
here
at
the
white
house
was
talking
with
people
at
justice
to
set
up
renos
news
conference
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
ms
myers
i
think
the
attorney
general
handled
her
end
of
the
situation
herself
and
made
the
decision
to
go
ahead
with
the
news
conference
once
there
was
a
point
at
which
there
was
enough
information
i
think
to
talk
with
some
accuracy
about
what
had
transpired
during
the
day
obviously
people
here
at
a
number
of
levels
were
keeping
in
touch
with
people
at
the
justice
department
and
at
the
fbi
to
try
to
keep
informed
about
what
was
happening
there
q
but
reno
said
that
she
didnt
talk
to
the
president
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
indication
she
hadnt
talked
to
anybody
at
the
white
house
so
who
ms
myers
there
were
people
talking
on
a
staffto
staff
level
q
i
understand
but
who
at
the
justice
department
was
handling
that
for
reno
who
was
talking
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
there
were
a
number
of
people
as
you
know
webb
hubbell
is
the
liaison
to
the
white
house
and
i
know
he
talked
to
a
number
of
people
here
there
were
a
number
of
people
at
a
number
of
different
levels
involved
i
dont
want
to
get
into
exactly
who
had
what
conversations
with
whom
but
there
were
a
number
of
conversations
obviously
the
justice
department
was
working
to
keep
the
white
house
informed
the
press
informed
to
the
best
of
its
ability
as
events
unfolded
throughout
the
day
q
did
webb
hubbell
talk
to
the
president
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
i
dont
know
if
he
talked
he
may
have
at
one
point
q
and
was
the
white
house
role
just
to
seek
information
about
what
happened
or
was
it
to
direct
the
public
information
campaign
that
followed
ms
myers
it
was
both
to
keep
abreast
of
the
situation
so
the
president
could
be
on
top
of
it
but
i
think
the
justice
department
managed
its
press
relations
on
it
we
were
obviously
very
interested
in
what
was
happening
there
throughout
the
day
and
the
president
was
following
it
very
closely
throughout
the
day
q
dee
dee
on
that
though
if
the
president
was
following
it
so
closely
and
he
had
talked
the
night
before
with
janet
reno
why
wouldnt
he
talk
to
her
at
all
since
then
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
if
hes
talked
to
her
this
morning
again
hes
kept
fully
aware
of
what
has
been
going
on
throughout
the
day
he
stands
percent
behind
her
decisions
hes
been
fully
supportive
of
her
as
he
said
yesterday
morning
before
events
transpired
and
yesterday
afternoon
in
a
written
statement
q
but
wouldnt
he
want
to
convey
those
thoughts
to
her
personally
yesterday
ms
myers
one
more
time
i
dont
know
if
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
no
yesterday
q
clearly
theres
a
perception
that
she
was
left
hung
out
to
dry
all
day
yesterday
ms
myers
thats
just
not
true
i
think
we
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
that
he
stands
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
the
president
stands
foursquare
behind
the
attorney
general
on
this
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
the
events
that
transpired
he
believes
that
janet
reno
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
acted
as
best
they
could
given
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
that
were
evident
at
the
time
i
dont
know
what
else
he
can
say
to
show
that
he
supports
her
percent
q
one
of
the
best
indications
of
that
is
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
tell
her
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
whether
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
why
cant
we
find
out
ms
myers
well
we
can
i
cant
do
it
standing
here
right
now
q
youve
got
six
people
here
all
theyve
got
to
do
is
pick
up
the
phone
ms
myers
helen
well
get
back
to
you
q
dee
dee
when
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
is
it
safe
to
assume
that
either
she
volunteered
or
he
inquired
about
whether
there
was
a
possible
downside
to
increasing
pressure
on
the
davidians
ms
myers
i
think
that
they
discussed
the
situation
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
specific
details
of
what
exactly
she
told
him
but
i
think
that
he
was
aware
of
the
risks
involved
q
dee
dee
the
president
yesterday
morning
said
it
was
entirely
her
decision
she
then
said
that
she
told
him
what
was
happening
and
he
said
okay
does
the
president
regard
it
that
he
gave
the
goahead
or
that
she
gave
the
goahead
ms
myers
i
think
what
they
both
said
yesterday
was
that
she
made
a
decision
based
on
all
the
available
facts
she
informed
him
about
that
and
he
raised
no
objections
again
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
about
that
q
and
he
said
okay
the
issue
is
over
the
responsibility
ms
myers
he
said
okay
q
does
okay
mean
ms
myers
the
president
accepts
ultimate
responsibility
q
dee
dee
the
presidents
investigation
that
hes
going
to
announce
would
that
be
conducted
by
someone
outside
the
administration
ms
myers
no
q
it
would
be
internal
is
it
meant
to
preclude
any
congressional
investigation
ms
myers
no
its
meant
simply
to
follow
up
on
the
incidents
that
occurred
yesterday
q
and
you
would
i
assume
therefore
cooperate
fully
with
any
congressional
hearings
that
would
be
held
ms
myers
to
the
best
of
our
ability
q
dee
dee
there
are
two
reports
out
this
morning
one
that
the
justice
department
or
fbi
or
whomever
apparently
had
a
bug
planted
inside
the
complex
and
the
other
is
that
the
children
may
have
been
injected
with
some
kind
of
poison
that
may
have
either
left
them
unconscious
or
maybe
even
killed
them
before
the
fire
what
do
you
know
about
those
two
ms
myers
nothing
more
than
ive
seen
in
news
accounts
this
morning
we
may
get
more
on
it
later
but
at
this
point
i
know
im
not
sure
anybody
knows
any
more
than
what
was
reported
by
people
who
came
out
of
the
compound
q
has
the
president
received
any
report
today
in
terms
of
fatalities
and
actually
what
was
going
on
what
theyve
been
able
to
find
out
on
in
the
compound
now
ms
myers
hes
been
briefed
i
dont
think
that
theyve
gotten
into
the
compound
yet
they
were
still
waiting
for
it
to
cool
off
i
dont
think
theres
much
beyond
whats
been
reported
in
the
news
accounts
but
he
has
been
kept
uptodate
on
it
q
dee
dee
the
president
stands
behind
attorney
general
reno
but
does
he
feel
that
she
perhaps
got
bad
advice
from
the
socalled
experts
ms
myers
he
believes
that
she
made
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
she
made
it
was
the
unanimous
decision
of
her
advisors
of
the
fbi
of
the
agents
on
the
ground
and
he
supports
that
q
what
about
the
validity
of
the
decisions
made
on
the
ground
does
he
back
those
ms
myers
hes
not
going
to
secondguess
decisions
made
q
dee
dee
you
just
said
he
stands
behind
the
decision
which
she
made
normally
in
a
situation
like
this
the
president
says
i
made
the
decision
but
youre
saying
she
made
the
decision
ms
myers
im
saying
that
the
president
was
briefed
about
the
decision
he
okayed
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
it
q
but
then
why
do
you
keep
using
the
terminology
the
decision
that
she
made
rather
than
the
decision
that
he
made
ms
myers
because
as
he
said
yesterday
she
evaluated
the
facts
based
on
evidence
presented
to
her
by
justice
department
and
fbi
which
is
part
of
the
justice
department
and
made
a
decision
and
then
briefed
the
president
on
that
decision
that
is
how
the
chain
of
command
works
she
briefed
him
he
signed
off
on
it
the
operation
went
forward
and
the
president
accepts
full
responsibility
q
in
that
chain
of
command
analogy
there
i
want
to
go
back
to
sessions
a
moment
do
you
know
if
this
was
a
plan
that
came
through
him
to
reno
or
was
it
presented
to
her
around
him
or
with
his
involvement
what
was
his
involvement
ms
myers
again
youd
have
to
go
to
the
justice
department
for
the
specific
interaction
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
q
does
the
president
stand
behind
director
sessions
ms
myers
he
supports
again
i
dont
know
how
many
different
ways
i
can
say
this
he
supports
the
decisions
made
by
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
he
fully
supports
the
attorney
general
in
this
im
not
stepping
away
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
i
want
to
but
janet
reno
is
the
one
who
briefed
him
the
one
who
made
the
decisions
as
the
head
of
the
justice
department
as
you
know
the
director
of
the
fbi
reports
to
the
attorney
general
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
she
informed
the
president
about
those
decisions
he
okayed
it
he
didnt
raise
any
objections
to
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
q
do
you
have
based
on
what
you
know
here
at
the
white
house
any
concerns
about
william
sessions
performance
during
this
ms
myers
nothing
to
suggest
that
no
q
along
those
same
lines
just
in
your
initial
review
of
the
situation
how
much
do
you
think
the
problems
might
have
come
from
not
having
a
justice
department
thats
fully
staffed
and
having
an
fbi
director
who
is
still
quite
uncertain
about
his
status
ms
myers
i
just
dont
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
operation
went
forward
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
that
q
did
the
white
house
express
any
alarm
that
janet
reno
chose
to
speak
to
the
live
network
media
before
she
chose
to
speak
to
clinton
ms
myers
no
she
was
carrying
forward
her
responsibility
to
inform
the
public
about
the
events
of
yesterday
i
think
she
did
a
very
admirable
job
the
president
agrees
with
that
q
before
sunday
how
often
was
the
president
briefed
on
the
situation
in
waco
ms
myers
he
was
kept
updated
on
a
regular
basis
on
a
daily
basis
q
who
briefed
the
president
ms
myers
well
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
what
conversations
he
had
with
whom
but
he
was
kept
uptodate
on
the
events
in
waco
he
has
daily
briefings
on
a
number
of
issues
q
no
no
was
this
a
regular
briefing
conducted
by
a
white
house
staff
person
or
was
it
by
a
justice
department
person
ms
myers
hes
briefed
regularly
by
a
white
house
staff
on
a
number
of
issues
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
briefs
him
on
what
subjects
q
another
subject
q
on
another
subject
q
now
were
going
to
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
ms
myers
i
welcome
it
q
how
close
are
you
to
signing
the
biodiversity
treaty
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
presidents
giving
a
speech
on
earth
day
tomorrow
well
have
more
to
say
about
it
then
q
any
details
on
where
or
when
that
speech
is
yet
ms
myers
its
at
am
and
i
dont
know
where
yet
q
dee
dee
is
this
a
major
policy
address
how
would
you
characterize
the
speech
tomorrow
ms
myers
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
earth
day
speech
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
major
departures
from
his
past
positions
on
these
things
but
again
i
dont
want
to
get
too
much
into
what
hes
going
to
talk
about
tomorrow
q
on
or
off
campus
q
is
this
at
a
location
outside
the
white
house
ms
myers
it
will
be
somewhere
in
washington
we
dont
know
exactly
where
yet
q
dee
dee
what
foreign
leaders
has
the
president
talked
to
since
friday
on
the
situation
in
bosnia
ms
myers
only
prime
minister
major
and
again
hell
try
to
reach
president
mitterrand
again
this
morning
q
david
owen
said
yesterday
and
joe
biden
said
today
both
of
them
agree
that
the
peace
process
is
not
going
to
work
that
the
serbs
are
not
going
to
sign
on
does
the
administration
still
believe
that
it
can
work
and
that
they
will
sign
on
ms
myers
obviously
the
ultimate
goal
is
some
sort
of
peaceful
resolution
to
the
conflict
in
bosnia
as
you
know
the
administration
is
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
at
this
point
the
situation
there
in
and
around
srebrenica
and
the
rest
of
eastern
bosnia
is
quite
serious
and
the
president
will
meet
with
his
bosnian
advisors
today
and
continue
to
press
forward
on
this
q
is
that
a
question
theyre
going
to
try
to
be
deciding
whether
or
not
the
peace
plan
remains
viable
ms
myers
again
theyll
be
reviewing
a
number
of
options
including
the
peace
plan
q
does
the
group
that
hes
meeting
with
today
include
reg
bartholomew
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes
here
but
it
will
be
among
the
usual
secretary
christopher
secretary
aspin
general
powell
q
dee
dee
do
you
have
anything
on
the
apparent
encounter
by
us
over
bosnia
today
some
aircraft
violating
the
nofly
zone
ms
myers
no
i
dont
ill
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
will
the
president
be
meeting
with
every
one
of
the
leaders
coming
to
town
for
the
holocaust
museum
ms
myers
he
will
hell
be
meeting
as
you
know
with
vaclav
havel
today
and
with
lech
walesa
tomorrow
and
then
with
the
rest
of
the
group
tomorrow
afternoon
q
as
a
group
or
one
by
one
ms
myers
i
believe
its
as
a
group
now
havel
and
walesa
asked
for
meetings
early
and
these
have
been
on
the
agenda
for
quite
some
time
but
he
will
meet
with
all
of
the
foreign
heads
of
state
that
are
here
q
dee
dee
has
the
president
decided
whether
he
supports
the
gay
and
lesbian
civil
rights
act
and
has
anything
been
worked
out
for
him
to
address
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
i
think
hell
probably
have
a
letter
or
some
kind
of
a
statement
to
the
march
we
havent
worked
out
the
exact
details
of
that
q
not
a
live
phone
hookup
ms
myers
probably
not
given
the
logistics
of
getting
to
boston
the
speech
as
you
know
is
at
pm
the
answer
to
the
other
part
of
your
question
is
no
he
hasnt
taken
a
position
on
it
q
you
said
that
speech
in
boston
was
at
pm
ms
myers
i
believe
so
yes
q
do
you
know
what
its
on
ms
myers
well
still
working
out
q
general
vesseys
coming
back
tonight
from
vietnam
when
will
he
be
meeting
with
the
president
ms
myers
no
specific
meeting
is
scheduled
well
talk
to
him
at
some
point
and
see
we
look
forward
to
his
report
but
exactly
how
hell
make
that
report
is
unclear
q
so
hes
not
going
to
come
immediately
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
no
q
the
aids
czar
how
close
are
you
ms
myers
still
working
on
it
q
drug
czar
q
do
you
expect
it
before
the
march
ms
myers
i
dont
have
a
time
line
on
it
q
did
the
president
ask
senator
mitchell
to
try
the
lloyd
cutler
ploy
to
break
the
filibuster
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
q
why
not
ms
myers
hes
just
not
going
to
q
are
senate
democrats
here
at
this
hour
ms
myers
no
thats
tomorrow
tomorrow
at
am
q
update
on
the
stimulus
possible
scaling
down
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
senate
will
vote
on
amendments
today
well
continue
to
talk
the
president
is
committed
to
some
kind
of
a
jobs
package
wed
like
to
see
it
passed
and
well
continue
in
conversations
throughout
the
day
and
see
where
we
end
up
q
when
this
briefing
is
over
can
you
give
us
word
through
the
speaker
or
whatever
whether
the
presidents
talked
to
janet
reno
ms
myers
well
be
happy
to
q
its
become
a
pressing
question
for
the
last
several
hours
ms
myers
no
just
this
minute
that
ive
been
here
and
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
follow
up
on
it
helen
q
does
he
have
an
opinion
on
hatfield
ms
myers
i
mean
obviously
he
prefers
he
offered
a
compromise
package
of
billion
he
believes
that
thats
the
best
alternative
believes
that
hes
obviously
willing
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
package
and
i
think
the
senate
will
vote
on
that
today
and
were
hopeful
that
the
presidents
bill
which
will
be
the
mitchell
amendment
will
be
the
one
that
will
be
approved
q
dee
dee
is
there
any
white
house
official
that
will
be
at
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
somebody
will
be
there
representing
the
president
i
dont
know
who
yet
q
well
has
it
been
decided
how
hes
going
to
address
is
it
going
to
be
a
videotape
or
a
phone
call
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
probably
be
a
letter
but
there
hasnt
been
a
final
decision
on
that
yet
q
the
official
will
read
the
letter
is
that
what
it
sounds
like
ms
myers
correct

lloyd
bentsen
came
in
here
this
morning
do
you
know
what
was
that
about
was
that
about

may
have
come
up
but
it
was
about
economic
issues
q
on

the
target

about
a
joint
session
of
congress
speech

the
end
of

president
will
present
the
health
care
plan
to
the
people

out
as
an
option

claytoon
let

that

why
does
this

people
btw
it
occurs
to
me
that
since
in
my
experience
men
are
much
more
interested
in
sex
than
women
and
want
to
have
sex
much
earlier
in
a
relationship
than
women
do
that
homosexuals
would
have
sex
more
often
simply
becuase
their
partner
is
of
a
like
mind
ie
heterosexual
men
would
be
more
promiscuous
if
they
could
its
my
observation
that
women
are
more
likely
to
me
more
strongly
indoctronated
into
now
wanting
sex
that
are
men
also
there
are
definite
double
standards
for
men
and
women
who
are
promiscuous
could
there
also
be
a
factor

about

moved

could
produce

more

the
result
was
that
an

was

things
are

a
way
that
in
order
to
go
with
the
system
and
make
money
everything
else
we
care
about
goes
to
shit
but
sorry
for
the
cliche
it
takes
two
to
tango
the
big
rich
corporations
achieved
that
wealth
because
we
buy
their
stuff
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
the
business
center
of
a
town
was
also
its
social
center
you
knew
the
merchants
you
did
business
with
or
even
local
kids
working
behind
the
counter
you
would
see
people
on
the
street
whom
you
knew
and
you
could
stop
for
a
chat
nowadays
local
merchants
are
going
out
of
business
and
people
shop
at
huge
anonymous
malls
serving
regional
populations
of
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
you
have
no
particular
relationship
with
the
companies
you
do
business
with
and
feel
no
particular
commitment
to
them
nor
they
to
you
major
components
of
what
defines
a
com
munity
have
been
destroyed
on
the
other
hand
the
products
we
buy
at
these
malls
are
a
lot
cheaper
due
to
economies
of
scale
and
foreign
manufacture
and
they
are
probably
of
better
or
at
least
more
consistent
quality
i
have
to
constantly
remind
myself
that
the
goal
of
human
society
is
not
to
make
money
money
doesnt
make
us
happy
it
just
prevents
certain
things
making
us
more
unhappy
therefore
dont
shoot
the
rich
shoot
the
conservatives
dont
blame
the
conservatives
for
this
everyone
makes
their
own
individual
choice
and
the
liberals
and
the
fencesitters
are
just
as
guilty
of
pretending
there
are
no
social
and
cultural
consequences
to
economic
choices

the

its
quite
possible
that
a
buyer

will
both
trust
some
third
party
more
than
either
trust
the
other
and
will
desire
the
moderation
of
that
third
party
but
if
a
random
third
party
assumes
the
right
to
interfere
in
a
transaction
contarary
to
the
wishes
of
the
primary
participants
odds
are
pretty
good
the
results
will
be
detrimental
so
we
try
to
ensure
that
the
process
of
deciding
whether
to
introduce
third
parties
isnt
random
as
steve
said
above
there
are
examples
where
third
parties
are
less
ignorant
or
corrupt
than
the
two
primary
parties
should
this
knowledge
not
be
able
to
help
a
third
party
should
be
able
to
use
persuasion
to
sway
the
transaction
if
on
the
other
hand
we
condone
the
use
of
force
or
threat
of
violence
by
the
third
party
then
we
are
in
trouble
a
fourth
party
could
say
that
it
knows
better
than
parties
and
and
a

and
so
on
who
wins
the
one
that
can

the

mr

president
havel
is
here
for
the

museum
opening
and
you
toured
the
museum
last
night
all
this
focus
on
the
holocaust
how
does
that
weigh
on
your
decision
making
process
as
far
as
bosnia
is
concerned
the
president
well
i
think
the
holocaust
is
the
most
extreme
example
the
world
has
ever
known
of
ethnic
cleansing
and
i
think
that
even
in
its
more
limited
manifestations
its
an
idea
that
should
be
opposed
you
couldnt
help
thinking
about
that
thats
not
to
compare
the
two
examples
theyre
not
identical
everyone
knows
that
but
i
think
that
the
united
states
should
always
seek
an
opportunity
to
stand
up
against
at
least
to
speak
out
against
inhumanity
q
sir
how
close
are
you
to
a
decision
on
more
sanctions
on
bosnia
the
president
well
of
course
weve
got
the
un
vote
ambassador
albright
was
instrumental
in
the
un
vote
to
strengthen
the
sanctions
and
they
are
quite
tough
and
we
now
are
putting
our
heads
at
the
business
of
implementing
them
and
looking
at
what
other
options
we
ought
to
consider
and
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
say
except
to
tell
you
that
i
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it
and
will
continue
to
over
the
next
several
days
q
following
your
meeting
today
sir
are
you
any
closer
to
some
sort
of
us
military
presence
there
the
president
i
have
not
made
any
decisions
q
president
clinton
why
have
you
decided
to
meet
with
mr
havel
the
president
well
im
just
honored
that
he
would
come
and
see
me
im
glad
hes
here
in
the
united
states
for
the
dedication
of
the
holocaust
museum
he
is
a
figure
widely
admired
in
our
country
and
around
the
world
and
a
very
important
person
in
europe
and
a
very
important
person
to

so
im
hoping
that
well
have

kinds
of

the

the

it

myers
hes
going
to
meet
there
with
a
group
of
citizens
mostly
people
who
supported
us
during
the
campaign
at
around
pm
were
still
working
out
the
final
times
q
at
the
airport
ms
myers
no
it
will
be
at
the
boston
harbor
hotel
and
then
he
will
also
meet
with
some
a
youth
group
that
authored
something
called
project
the
speech
to
the
publishers
is
actually
at
pm
it
will
be
followed
by
qa
and
then
after
the
speech
and
qa
hell
attend
a
reception
with
the
publishers
and
then
return
to
washington
from
boston
and
thats
it
for
the
weekend
q
has
the
president
seen
the
report
from
or
the
letter
communication
from
the
foreign
service
officers
also
obviously
the
communication
from
madeleine
albright
and
what
is
his
reaction
to
their
call
on
him
ms
myers
well
obviously
the
letter
was
written
to
secretary
christopher
i
believe
secretary
christopher
received
the
letter
on
saturday
he
reviewed
it
and
met
with
the
authors
on
monday
to
discuss
their
views
he
believes
its
an
important
part
of
the
policymaking
process
and
is
taking
their
views
into
account
as
we
go
forward
in
the
development
of
the
bosnia
policy
q
what
is
the
presidents
reaction
ms
myers
the
president
hasnt
seen
the
letter
it
was
something
that
was
directed
towards
secretary
christopher
in
terms
of
he
hasnt
seen
specifically
the
letter
but
in
terms
of
their
concerns
generally
what
the
president
has
said
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
options
on
the
table
now
including
ones
that
werent
there
before
and
i
think
hes
as
is
everybody
gravely
concerned
about
the
situation
in
bosnia
q
is
he
influenced
by
that
i
mean
how
does
he
feel
about
the
fact
that
all
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
those
desk
officers
ms
myers
many
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
part
of
the
process
its
something
their
views
will
clearly
be
considered
i
think
secretary
christopher
met
with
the
group
immediately
to
discuss
their
views
i
think
he
believes
that
there
ought
to
be
room
for
opinions
and
that
those
opinions
ought
to
be
considered
particularly
from
people
who
work
closely
on
the
issues
q
what
do
you
mean
there
are
options
on
the
table
that
werent
there
before
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
said
last
week
that
there
were
options
such
as
lifting
the
arms
embargo
to
the
bosnian
muslims
that
had
been
previously
off
the
table
that
are
now
being
considered
q
dee
dee
in
terms
of
those
options
madeleine
albright
is
saying
that
potentially
there
could
be
unilateral
action
by
the
us
if
the
europeans
did
not
go
along
is
that
on
the
table
ms
myers
well
i
cant
discuss
anything
that
would
any
conversations
that
would
have
happened
between
ambassador
albright
and
the
president
but
i
think
the
president
has
said
he
would
certainly
is
working
with
our
european
allies
hes
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
european
leaders
and
is
trying
to
build
some
consensus
there
q
will
he
reach
a
decision
will
he
have
anything
specific
to
say
today
ms
myers
no
i
mean
in
term
of
there
will
be
no
new
announcement
of
policy
today
q
does
your
statement
mean
he
has
ruled
out
unilateral
action
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
at
this
point
he
has
said
i
think
hes
been
fairly
clear
about
it
that
the
he
believes
that
the
us
needs
to
act
in
concert
with
its
allies
on
this
q
on
that
point
does
he
believe
that
the
us
though
does
have
builtin
authority
from
the
united
nations
already
to
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
well
i
think
the
un
resolution
makes
it
clear
that
you
can
act
unilaterally
in
support
of
any
humanitarian
relief
effort
i
think
the
broader
point
is
that
anything
we
do
any
options
that
we
decide
to
pursue
we
will
make
sure
that
it
is
consistent
with
un
authority
and
if
its
not
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
we
get
it
q
dee
dee
then
how
does
the
white
house
someone
as
distinguished
as
elie
wiesel
who
says
that
not
enough
is
being
done
to
stop
the
atrocities
going
on
in
bosnia
ms
myers
i
think
that
thats
why
were
considering
additional
options
i
think
that
mr
wiesels
comments
yesterday
were
quite
compelling
the
situation
in
bosnia
is
tragic
the
president
is
very
concerned
about
it
he
has
i
think
president
clinton
has
worked
very
hard
to
take
further
actions
to
continue
to
isolate
serbia
in
the
world
community
clearly
were
considering
other
options
because
the
president
is
concerned
that
perhaps
its
not
enough
q
in
terms
of
what
you
were
just
talking
about
it
sounds
like
resolution
justifies
unilateral
action
by
the
us
to
protect
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
dont
think
it
i
wouldnt
use
the
word
justify
it
permits
unilateral
action
by
any
country
in
protecting
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
relief
but
i
think
thats
just
an
explanation
of
the
resolution
i
think
any
action
that
we
take
will
be
consistent
with
un
resolutions
or
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
it
is
permissible
or
well
get
further
action
q
the
president
and
other
officials
have
ruled
out
unilateral
us
action
in
bosnia
in
the
past
youre
declining
to
do
that
this
morning
ms
myers
no
i
said
the
president
has
said
repeatedly
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
that
doesnt
mean
that
he
wont
act
alone
which
has
been
said
before
explicitly
ms
myers
i
dont
mean
to
imply
a
change
in
policy
the
president
has
said
all
along
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
one
other
little
question
did
he
know
about
this
letter
from
the
foreign
service
officers
before
it
hit
the
papers
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
secretary
christopher
they
may
have
had
a
private
conversation
about
it
the
president
has
not
seen
it
q
they
met
on
monday
right
christopher
met
surely
he
must
have
brought
that
up
ms
myers
again
they
may
have
talked
privately
about
it
but
q
dee
dee
what
youre
saying
is
that
the
albright
recommendation
has
been
rejected
is
that
correct
ms
myers
no
i
didnt
say
that
at
all
i
said
i
wont
i
said
i
wouldnt
comment
on
any
conversations
or
communications
q
shes
advocating
unilateral
action
and
youre
saying
in
effect
that
we
will
not
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
i
am
not
confirming
anything
that
madeleine
albright
may
or
may
not
have
recommended
q
given
the
sometimes
delicate
complicated
and
frustrating
nature
of
negotiations
with
the
allies
on
this
issue
does
the
president
find
this
kind
of
letter
from
foreign
service
officers
of
the
state
department
helpful
to
that
process
hurtful
to
that
ms
myers
i
think
that
their
views
are
obviously
being
considered
the
secretary
received
that
memo
on
saturday
and
two
days
later
he
met
with
them
in
order
to
have
a
more
thorough
airing
of
their
views
of
the
basis
for
their
views
to
discuss
in
greater
detail
the
options
that
they
had
presented
in
the
letter
q
doesnt
it
put
some
kind
of
pressure
on
additional
pressure
on
him
now
from
within
his
own
administration
to
act
regardless
of
what
the
allies
may
or
may
not
do
ms
myers
i
think
clearly
theres
a
broad
policy
review
underway
now
and
the
president
and
his
advisors
are
considering
a
number
of
options
including
some
of
those
outlined
in
the
letter
from
the
folks
over
at
the
state
department
now
no
decisions
have
been
made
on
that
yet
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
through
review
underway
and
that
their
opinions
are
being
very
seriously
considered
q
if
i
can
just
follow
up
i
guess
what
im
looking
for
is
what
was
his
reaction
to
this
letter
did
he
say
good
this
bolsters
my
position
or
did
he
say
damn
this
is
just
what
i
dont
need
right
now
ms
myers
i
think
he
said
this
helps
contribute
substantively
to
the
debate
its
important
that
all
views
be
considered
and
aired
thoroughly
that
before
he
makes
a
decision
he
wants
to
have
the
best
possible
advice
and
information
possible
and
this
i
think
in
many
ways
furthers
that
goal
q
so
internal
advice
to
a
cabinet
official
or
the
president
its
all
open
now
and
you
wouldnt
take
any
umbrage
or
say
that
they
were
out
of
line
ms
myers
i
think
that
the
fact
that
secretary
christopher
met
with
them
to
discuss
their
views
and
make
sure
they
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
more
complete
conversation
about
it
is
conclusive
evidence
that
their
views
are
welcome
q
does
the
policy
review
include
what
madeleine
albright
has
suggested
and
what
joe
biden
and
others
have
suggested
which
is
that
the
previous
un
resolutions
authorize
unilateral
action
military
action
for
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
the
unilateral
option
is
on
the
table
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
weve
had
two
different
q
isnt
that
a
change
dee
dee
q
that
would
be
a
change
of
policy
q
particularly
if
it
includes
ground
troops
which
has
been
specifically
ruled
out
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
has
been
well
no
i
dont
that
is
not
q
are
you
talking
about
all
options
ms
myers
all
options
i
think
the
president
has
been
fairly
clear
about
that
so
let
me
just
review
again
what
he
has
said
he
has
said
that
the
president
has
said
all
options
are
on
the
table
with
the
exception
of
the
introduction
of
ground
troops
which
he
has
never
suggested
he
has
ruled
that
out
from
the
beginning
q
hasnt
he
ruled
out
unilateral
action
of
any
sort
ms
myers
he
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
the
us
can
solve
the
problems
in
the
former
yugoslavia
by
itself
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
very
complicated
options
on
the
table
right
now
i
dont
think
that
again
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
specific
options
that
are
being
considered
other
than
in
the
broad
categories
that
weve
already
said
things
like
lifting
the
arms
embargo
against
the
bosnian
muslims
things
that
i
think
weve
talked
about
in
broad
terms
this
is
a
very
complicated
situation
the
options
being
presented
and
considered
are
very
complicated
q
air
strikes
on
the
table
ms
myers
again
i
think
thats
been
fairly
clearly
pointed
out
that
thats
something
thats
being
discussed
q
dee
dee
are
ground
troops
on
the
ms
myers
no
ground
troops
are
not
being
considered
q
you
said
there
was
not
going
to
be
you
said
you
were
not
announcing
a
change
of
policy
then
you
said
everything
is
on
the
table
were
confused
are
unilateral
actions
on
the
table
ms
myers
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
the
president
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
the
allies
on
this
q
wants
to
but
hes
willing
to
i
mean
if
they
dont
go
along
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
on
this
hes
continuing
to
have
discussions
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
thats
clear
the
conversation
is
ongoing
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
them
to
find
the
best
possible
solution
and
next
step
on
this
q
dee
dee
the
allies
have
taken
the
position
that
to
conduct
any
kind
of
air
strikes
in
bosnia
would
have
the
opposite
effect
of
ensuring
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
that
they
feel
that
their
troops
on
the
ground
monitoring
the
delivery
of
that
aid
would
become
vulnerable
and
the
bosnians
ms
myers
im
not
sure
thats
the
consistent
i
mean
im
not
sure
who
youre
referring
to
q
the
british
and
the
french
q
yes
the
british
and
french
theyve
taken
the
position
that
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
would
be
jeopardized
by
any
kind
of
air
strikes
against
the
bosnian
military
does
the
us
believe
differently
from
that
ms
myers
the
president
has
had
conversations
with
both
mitterrand
and
major
as
you
know
i
think
that
there
is
a
thorough
review
of
policy
going
on
in
those
countries
as
well
and
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
the
nature
of
the
presidents
discussions
other
than
to
say
that
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
as
we
move
forward
and
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
that
process
is
ongoing
q
the
other
day
voted
against
any
military
intervention
yesterday
does
the
president
regard
that
as
the
end
of
the
line
or
does
he
does
still
hold
out
some
possibility
of
unilateral
action
the
allies
have
been
very
very
plain
that
they
do
not
want
to
do
anything
ms
myers
the
consultations
are
ongoing
thats
all
i
can
tell
you
at
this
point
q
are
you
saying
that
there
wont
be
any
announcement
on
bosnia
today
in
the
press
conference
ms
myers
no
that
is
not
the
intention
of
the
press
conference
q
what
is
the
intention
ms
myers
its
an
opportunity
to
take
questions
he
may
have
a
brief
im
sure
hell
have
a
brief
opening
statement
but
it
is
not
an
opportunity
to
outline
a
new
policy
on
bosnia
that
will
not
happen
q
can
you
tell
us
what
the
subject
of
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
its
sort
of
a
general
statement
of
where
we
are
q
after
the
first
hundred
days
you
mean
ms
myers
its
not
a
long
statement
i
mean
this
is
just
generally
dont
look
for
any
major
policy
pronouncements
q
do
you
know
what
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
but
its
perhaps
later
today
ill
be
able
to
tell
you
with
more
certainty
i
think
thats
still
under
review
but
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
its
not
a
mystery
its
not
meant
to
be
its
just
to
take
questions
q
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
whether
what
the
opening
statement
is
on
ms
myers
since
the
major
purpose
here
is
just
to
take
questions
its
not
completely
resolved
yet
q
dee
dee
one
policy
that
was
expected
last
week
and
that
the
white
house
you
and
george
seemed
to
indicate
we
might
get
would
be
an
aids
czar
will
he
announce
that
today
and
whats
the
delay
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
i
think
we
said
it
would
happen
soon
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
with
any
certainty
that
it
would
be
this
week
it
is
coming
soon
i
dont
anticipate
that
happening
today
q
whats
the
delay
isnt
this
the
perfect
time
to
announce
an
aids
czar
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
its
a
delay
i
think
the
process
is
ongoing
to
find
the
best
possible
person
and
to
go
through
the
necessary
background
checks
and
to
make
sure
that
weve
crossed
the
ts
and
dotted
the
is
before
we
make
an
announcement
q
dee
dee
what
are
zoe
bairds
qualifications
for
the
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
and
why
wasnt
her
appointment
announced
here
ms
myers
the
qualifications
i
dont
know
if
theres
a
specific
list
ill
have
to
check
and
see
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
people
there
on
the
board
with
different
backgrounds
many
of
them
have
long
histories
in
intelligence
or
other
government
service
i
think
theres
a
broad
variety
of
views
across
political
spectrum
and
across
backgrounds
that
are
represented
there
we
never
made
a
formal
announcement
other
than
the
chairman
of
the
board
which
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
why
would
he
appoint
her
though
if
the
american
people
and
many
in
the
senate
rejected
her
for
another
government
job
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
that
the
american
people
ever
had
voted
on
her
and
i
certainly
she
was
never
rejected
in
the
senate
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
but
the
president
believes
shes
a
very
competent
person
hes
said
that
zoe
baird
do
you
understand
what
the
question
is
zoe
baird
is
on
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
q
you
said
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
q
her
nomination
was
withdrawn
after
public
outrage
over
violating
federal
laws
ms
myers
right
she
never
she
was
never
but
you
said
she
was
rejected
by
the
senate
i
was
just
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
she
was
never
voted
on
by
the
senate
q
so
you
dont
think
that
is
any
problem
ms
myers
i
dont
think
theres
any
problem
q
she
has
been
appointed
to
this
board
is
that
a
fact
ms
myers
yes
q
does
she
need
confirmation
for
this
does
she
need
confirmation
to
be
a
member
of
the
ms
myers
no
its
a
presidential
appointment
q
usually
announcements
are
made
here
at
the
white
house
was
there
a
decision
not
to
announce
her
publicly
ms
myers
we
didnt
make
an
announcement
people
who
asked
were
told
who
the
members
of
the
board
were
we
didnt
make
an
official
announcement
if
anybodys
interested
in
that
we
can
certainly
put
out
the
list
of
names
q
id
like
to
know
q
dont
such
board
members
dont
you
normally
as
a
matter
of
routinely
put
out
releases
on
all
these
boards
and
presidential
appointment
regardless
of
their
dimension
ms
myers
not
always
but
again
im
happy
to
put
this
out
q
isnt
that
the
standard
practice
q
that
was
past
practice
ms
myers
again
im
happy
to
put
it
out
well
put
out
a
list
of
the
members
of
the
board
today
q
dee
dee
i
dont
want
to
try
to
fail
to
let
you
get
out
of
this
swamp
but
laughter
all
i
really
want
to
know
is
hasnt
it
been
the
practice
in
this
administration
for
such
announcements
to
be
made
routinely
ms
myers
i
think
generally
but
not
always
and
were
happy
to
put
that
out
today
q
what
is
the
board
what
is
her
title
what
is
the
size
of
the
board
ms
myers
there
is
roughly
a
dozen
members
on
the
board
it
is
a
civilian
board
although
their
are
some
obviously
retired
military
personnel
on
the
board
that
provide
input
into
intelligence
policy
for
the
president
again
the
chairman
of
that
board
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
and
did
he
recommend
baird
q
whats
the
name
of
the
board
ms
myers
its
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
pfiab
q
whats
her
qualification
that
she
had
employed
an
illegal
alien
is
that
laughter
ms
myers
do
you
want
an
answer
to
the
question
or
you
just
want
to
make
a
joke
q
let
me
phrase
it
another
way
why
shouldnt
this
appointment
be
viewed
as
a
payback
for
the
difficulty
she
had
a
couple
of
months
ago
ms
myers
because
its
not
q
whats
her
experience
in
foreign
intelligence
ms
myers
shes
an
experienced
attorney
someone
who
the
president
believes
is
very
competent
and
qualified
and
i
think
part
of
the
mission
of
this
board
is
to
provide
civilian
input
not
everybody
on
the
board
is
supposed
to
be
an
intelligence
expert
that
is
not
the
boards
mission
it
is
to
provide
civilian
input
for
the
president
as
he
makes
decisions
regarding
intelligence
matters
he
believes
shes
very
qualified
very
competent
person
enormously
talented
and
has
said
that
throughout
q
is
this
just
a
figment
of
my
overactive
imagination
or
was
there
discussion
early
on
about
abolishing
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
ms
myers
i
dont
think
so
on
december
when
he
announced
all
of
his
foreign
policy
advisors
he
announced
that
he
would
had
appointed
admiral
crowe
as
the
head
of
the
board
so
i
dont
believe
theres
ever
been
any
q
earlier
than
that
during
the
transition
ms
myers
no
i
dont
believe
so
it
was
announced
again
on
december
admiral
crowe
couldnt
be
there
but
it
was
announced
q
are
members
paid
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
but
ill
doublecheck
q
on
another
subject
on
waco
how
do
you
explain
the
discrepancy
between
the
federal
reports
of
the
autopsies
of
the
bodies
that
are
coming
out
of
waco
and
the
state
i
guess
its
the
texas
ranger
reports
ms
myers
most
of
the
information
is
coming
the
federal
information
is
coming
from
the
site
clearly
theres
been
some
discrepancies
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
officials
in
the
justice
department
were
told
i
believe
the
day
before
yesterday
that
there
were
several
bodies
found
with
bullet
holes
i
think
theres
some
discrepancy
about
that
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
q
is
the
president
going
to
get
involved
in
trying
to
sort
out
what
seems
to
be
becoming
a
jurisdictional
morass
down
there
with
some
people
withdrawing
others
saying
theyre
in
charge
but
others
justice
fbi
texas
rangers
all
grabbing
a
piece
of
this
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
hes
going
to
try
to
mediate
the
dispute
i
mean
ill
let
you
know
if
theres
anything
he
intends
to
do
about
it
but
as
you
know
there
are
several
levels
of
investigation
ongoing
and
were
hopeful
that
they
can
work
together
q
is
there
any
one
agency
or
official
down
there
in
charge
of
everything
ms
myers
i
dont
know
ill
have
to
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
sundays
speech
ms
myers
its
going
to
be
fairly
general
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
any
specific
announcements
i
think
its
going
to
be
sort
of
a
q
does
he
have
a
topic
that
hes
going
to
talk
about
ms
myers
were
still
working
on
it
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
announcements
of
like
the
drug
czar
or
something
like
that
q
is
it
sort
of
a
days
speech
sort
of
my
excellent
adventure
for
days
laughter
ms
myers
not
exactly
but
i
think
hell
take
a
little
bit
broader
look
about
whats
happened
in
the
last
q
foreign
domestic
ms
myers
a
little
bit
of
both
but
i
think
a
lot
of
domestic
q
and
overview
ms
myers
yes
more
of
an
overview
than
a
specific
policy
announcement
q
has
there
been
an
agreement
yet
on
a
forum
by
which
the
president
will
address
the
gay
rights
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
it
will
be
a
letter
read
to
the
crowd
by
congresswoman
nancy
pelosi
q
is
that
available
ms
myers
not
yet
but
it
will
be
sure
q
are
you
going
to
put
it
out
here
or
ms
myers
well
probably
put
it
out
here
on
sunday
q
travel
next
week
ms
myers
unclear
q
what
was
the
question
q
likely
ms
myers
i
dont
q
likely
possible
ms
myers
possible
q
whats
possible
ms
myers
travel
q
george
mentioned
yesterday
campaign
finance
reform
and
national
service
legislative
proposals
next
week
do
you
have
days
yet
for
them
ms
myers
not
yet
q
can
you
tell
us
which
order
ms
myers
campaign
finance
reform
first
national
service
later
in
the
week
q
is
there
any
coverage
tomorrow
in
williamsburg
ms
myers
no
q
and
any
report
in
the
aftermath
of
the
day
ms
myers
any
readout
from
the
day
q
readout
ms
myers
its
possible
jeff
eller
will
be
down
there
i
think
he
can
go
through
what
the
president
did
during
the
day
we
dont
expect
any
photo
op
or
anything
other
than
departure
here
in
the
morning
q
dee
dee
the
president
has
not
made
a
regular
practice
as
some
of
his
predecessors
have
of
going
to
camp
david
in
fact
hes
been
there
what
once
or
twice
ms
myers
twice
q
why
this
weekend
ms
myers
he
went
two
weekends
ago
as
you
know
on
the
way
home
from
his
fatherinlaws
funeral
i
think
that
they
found
it
to
be
a
good
experience
and
a
nice
way
for
them
to
spend
some
time
together
as
a
family
and
this
is
just
an
opportunity
to
do
the
same
q
theres
no
march
there
q
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
march
here
ms
myers
no
q
since
hes
going
to
be
in
town
sunday
morning
now
instead
of
in
jamestown
have
you
thought
about
him
making
a
quick
passby
flyover
laughter
ms
myers
hell
fly
straight
to
boston
q
flying
straight
did
you
say
laughter
q
george
took
a
question
yesterday
on
waco
the
president
had
said
on
tuesday
in
the
rose
garden
that
there
was
a
minor
disagreement
on
tactics
between
the
military
advisors
and
the
fbi
and
the
question
was
whether
you
knew
exactly
what
that
was
and
whether
it
related
to
the
use
of
the
particular
kind
of
tear
gas
do
you
have
an
answer
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
ill
check
the
press
thank
you
am
edt
subject
waco
investigation
do
we
know
yet
who
will
be
holding
the
hearings
and
if
so
do
we
know
who
is
on
the
committee
of
question
askers
im
sure
many
of
us
have
potential
questions
wed
like
to
send

them

homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
you
havent
shown
any
disproportionate
involvement
the
janus
report
which
came
out
recently
gives
as
the
percentage
of
exclusively
or
predominantly
gay
men
no
one
is
presumably
going
to
say
theyre
gay
if
theyre
not
but
some
no

are
going
to
hide
their
homosexuality
in
surveys
thus
the
is
a
lower

i
still
say

do
you
have
a
question
q
mr

theres
a
growing
feeling
that
the
western
response
to
bloodshed
in
bosnia
has
been
woefully
inadequate
holocaust
survivor
elie
wiesel
asked
you
yesterday
to
do
something
anything
to
stop
the
fighting
is
the
united
states
considering
taking
unilateral
action
such
as
air
strikes
against
serb
artillery
sites
the
president
well
first
let
me
say
as
you
know
for
more
than
a
week
now
we
have
been
seriously
reviewing
our
options
for
further
action
and
i
want
to
say
too
lets
look
at
the
last
three
months
since
i
became
president
i
have
worked
with
our
allies
and
we
have
tried
to
move
forward
first
on
the
nofly
zone
on
enforcement
of
it
on
the
humanitarian
airdrops
on
the
war
crimes
investigation
on
getting
the
bosnian
muslims
involved
in
the
peace
process
we
have
made
some
progress
and
now
we
have
a
very
much
tougher
sanctions
resolution
and
leon
fuerth
who
is
the
national
security
advisor
to
the
vice
president
is
in
europe
now
working
on
implementing
that
that
is
going
to
make
a
big
difference
to
serbia
and
we
are
reviewing
other
options
i
think
we
should
act
we
should
lead
the
united
states
should
lead
we
have
led
for
the
last
three
months
we
have
moved
the
coalition
and
to
be
fair
our
allies
in
europe
have
been
willing
to
do
their
part
and
they
have
troops
on
the
ground
there
but
i
do
not
think
we
should
act
alone
unilaterally
nor
do
i
think
we
will
have
to
and
in
the
next
several
days
i
think
we
will
finalize
the
extensive
review
which
has
been
going
on
and
which
has
taken
a
lot
of
my
time
as
well
as
the
time
of
the
administration
as
it
should
have
over
the
last
days
or
so
i
think
well
finish
that
in
the
near
future
and
then
well
have
a
policy
and
well
announce
it
and
everybody
can
evaluate
it
q
can
i
follow
up
the
president
sure
q
do
you
see
any
parallel
between
the
ethnic
cleansing
in
bosnia
and
the
holocaust
the
president
i
think
the
holocaust
is
on
a
whole
different
level
i
think
it
is
without
precedent
or
peer
in
human
history
on
the
other
hand
ethnic
cleansing
is
the
kind
of
inhumanity
that
the
holocaust
took
to
the
nth
degree
the
idea
of
moving
people
around
and
abusing
them
and
often
killing
them
solely
because
of
their
ethnicity
is
an
abhorrent
thing
and
it
is
especially
troublesome
in
that
area
where
people
of
different
ethnic
groups
live
side
by
side
for
so
long
together
and
i
think
you
have
to
stand
up
against
it
i
think
its
wrong
we
were
talking
today
about
all
of
the
other
troubles
in
that
region
i
was
happy
to
see
the
violence
between
the
croats
and
the
muslims
in
bosnia
subside
this
morning
and
i
think
were
making
progress
on
that
front
but
whats
going
on
with
the
serbians
and
the
ethnic
cleansing
is
qualitatively
different
than
the
other
conflicts
both
within
the
former
yugoslavia
and
in
other
parts
of
the
region
q
mr
president
by
any
count
you
have
not
had
a
good
week
in
your
presidency
the
tragedy
in
waco
the
defeat
of
your
stimulus
bill
the
standoff
in
bosnia
what
did
you
do
wrong
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
differently
how
do
you
look
at
things
are
you
reassessing
laughter
the
president
i
dont
really
believe
that
the
situation
in
bosnia
its
not
been
a
good
week
for
the
world
but
i
dont
know
that
the
administration
could
have
made
it
different
on
the
stimulus
package
id
like
to
put
it
into
the
larger
context
and
remind
you
that
in
this
days
we
have
already
fundamentally
changed
the
direction
of
an
american
government
we
have
abandoned
trickledown
economics
weve
abandoned
the
policies
that
brought
the
debt
of
this
country
from
trillion
to
trillion
in
only
a
decade
the
budget
plan
which
passed
the
congress
which
will
reduce
the
deficit
and
increase
investment
has
led
to
a
low
in
mortgage
rates
dramatically
lower
interest
rates
there
are
probably
people
in
this
room
who
have
refinanced
their
home
mortgages
in
the
last
three
months
or
who
have
had
access
to
cheaper
credit
thats
going
to
put
tens
of
billion
dollars
coursing
throughout
this
economy
in
ways
that
are
very
very
good
for
the
country
and
so
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
economically
i
regret
that
the
stimulus
did
not
pass
and
i
have
begun
to
ask
and
will
continue
to
ask
not
only
people
in
the
administration
but
people
in
the
congress
whether
there
is
something
i
could
have
done
differently
to
pass
that
part
of
the
reason
it
didnt
pass
was
politics
part
of
it
was
a
difference
in
ideas
there
are
really
people
still
who
believe
that
its
not
needed
i
just
disagree
with
that
i
think
the
recovery
the
economists
say
its
been
underway
for
about
two
years
and
weve
still
had
months
of
seven
percent
unemployment
and
all
the
wealthy
countries
are
having
trouble
creating
jobs
so
i
think
there
was
an
idea
base
an
argument
there
that
while
were
waiting
for
the
lower
interest
rates
and
the
deficit
reduction
and
the
investments
of
the
next
four
years
to
take
effect
this
sort
of
supplemental
appropriation
should
go
forward
now
i
have
to
tell
you
i
did
misgauge
that
because
a
majority
of
the
republican
senators
now
sitting
in
the
senate
voted
for
a
similar
stimulus
when
ronald
reagan
was
president
in
and
voted
times
for
regular
supplemental
appropriations
like
this
i
just
misgauged
it
and
i
hope
that
i
can
learn
something
ive
just
been
here
days
and
you
know
i
was
a
governor
working
with
a
contentious
legislature
for
years
and
it
took
me
a
decade
to
get
political
reform
there
so
it
takes
time
to
change
things
but
i
basically
feel
very
good
about
whats
happened
in
the
first
days
with
regard
to
the
congress
q
waco
the
president
well
with
regard
to
waco
i
dont
have
much
to
add
to
what
ive
already
said
i
think
it
is
a
i
want
the
situation
looked
into
i
want
us
to
bring
in
people
who
have
any
insights
to
bear
on
that
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
whole
thing
be
thoroughly
gone
over
but
i
still
maintain
what
i
said
from
the
beginning
that
the
offender
there
was
david
koresh
and
i
do
not
think
the
united
states
government
is
responsible
for
the
fact
that
a
bunch
of
fanatics
decided
to
kill
themselves
and
im
sorry
that
they
killed
their
children
q
mr
president
to
follow
up
partly
on
helen
on
your
stimulus
package
and
on
your
political
approach
to
capitol
hill
ross
perot
said
today
that
youre
playing
games
with
the
american
people
in
your
tax
policy
he
was
strongly
critical
of
your
stimulus
package
he
said
hes
going
to
launch
an
advertising
campaign
against
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
how
are
you
going
to
handle
his
political
criticism
will
it
complicate
your
efforts
on
the
hill
with
your
economic
plan
and
do
you
plan
to
repackage
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
in
your
stimulus
program
and
try
to
resubmit
them
to
the
hill
the
president
let
me
answer
that
question
first
were
going
to
revisit
all
of
that
over
the
next
few
days
im
going
to
be
talking
to
members
of
congress
and
to
others
to
see
what
we
can
do
about
that
with
regard
to
the
economic
plan
i
must
say
i
found
that
rather
amazing
i
dont
want
to
get
into
an
argument
with
mr
perot
ill
be
interested
to
hear
what
his
specifics
are
but
i
would
go
back
and
read
his
book
and
his
plan
theres
a
remarkable
convergence
except
that
we
have
more
specific
budget
cuts
we
raise
taxes
less
on
the
middle
class
and
more
on
the
wealthy
but
otherwise
the
plans
are
remarkably
similar
so
i
think
it
would
be
ill
be
interested
to
see
if
maybe
perhaps
hes
changed
his
position
from
his
book
last
year
and
he
has
some
new
ideas
to
bring
to
bear
ill
be
glad
to
hear
them
q
to
follow
up
sir
how
do
you
plan
to
handle
his
political
criticism
hes
launched
a
campaign
against
you
do
you
think
you
can
sit
back
and
just
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
will
ask
you
to
apply
the
same
level
of
scrutiny
to
him
as
you
do
to
me
and
if
hes
changed
his
position
from
the
positions
he
took
in
the
campaign
last
year
then
we
need
to
know
why
and
what
his
ideas
are
maybe
hes
got
some
constructive
ideas
i
think
the
american
people
have
shown
that
theyre
very
impatient
with
people
who
dont
want
to
produce
results
and
the
one
thing
i
think
that
everybody
has
figured
out
about
me
in
the
last
even
if
they
dont
agree
with
what
i
do
is
that
i
want
to
get
something
done
i
just
came
here
to
try
to
change
things
i
want
to
do
things
and
i
want
to
do
things
that
help
peoples
lives
so
my
judgment
is
that
if
he
makes
a
suggestion
that
is
good
that
is
constructive
that
takes
us
beyond
some
idea
ive
proposed
that
will
change
peoples
lives
for
the
better
fine
but
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
the
test
that
we
apply
to
everyone
who
weighs
into
this
debate
and
not
just
to
the
president
q
mr
president
to
go
back
to
bosnia
for
a
minute
you
continue
to
insist
that
this
has
to
be
multilateral
action
a
criteria
that
seems
to
have
hamstrung
us
when
it
comes
to
many
options
thus
far
and
makes
it
look
as
if
this
is
a
state
of
paralysis
the
united
states
is
the
last
remaining
superpower
why
is
it
not
appropriate
in
this
situation
for
the
united
states
to
act
unilaterally
the
president
well
the
united
states
surely
you
would
agree
that
the
united
states
even
as
the
last
remaining
superpower
has
to
act
consistent
with
international
law
under
some
mandate
of
the
united
nations
q
but
you
have
a
mandate
and
the
president
they
do
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
under
review
i
havent
ruled
out
any
option
for
action
i
would
remind
all
of
you
i
have
not
ruled
out
any
option
except
that
we
have
not
discussed
and
we
are
not
considering
the
introduction
of
american
forces
into
continuing
hostilities
there
we
are
not
so
we
are
reviewing
other
options
but
i
also
would
remind
you
that
to
be
fair
our
allies
have
had
the
french
the
british
and
the
canadians
have
had
troops
on
the
ground
there
they
have
been
justifiably
worried
about
those
but
they
have
supported
the
airdrops
the
toughening
of
the
sanctions
they
welcomed
the
american
delegation
now
in
europe
working
on
how
to
make
these
sanctions
really
work
and
really
bite
against
serbia
and
i
can
tell
you
that
the
other
nations
involved
are
also
genuinely
reassessing
their
position
and
i
would
not
rule
out
the
fact
that
we
can
reach
an
agreement
for
a
concerted
action
that
goes
beyond
where
we
have
been
i
dont
have
any
criticism
of
the
british
the
french
and
others
about
that
q
would
that
be
military
action
q
mr
president
several
of
the
leading
lights
in
your
administration
ranging
from
your
fbi
director
to
your
un
ambassador
to
your
deputy
budget
director
to
your
health
services
secretary
have
issued
statements
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
which
are
absolutely
contradictory
to
some
of
the
positions
youve
taken
in
your
administration
why
is
that
are
you
losing
your
political
grip
the
president
give
me
an
example
q
example
judge
sessions
said
that
there
was
no
child
abuse
in
waco
madeleine
albright
has
said
in
this
mornings
newspapers
at
least
that
she
favors
air
strikes
in
bosnia
all
of
these
are
things
you
said
that
you
didnt
support
the
president
first
of
all
i
dont
know
what
we
know
that
david
koresh
had
sex
with
children
i
think
that
is
undisputed
is
it
not
is
it
not
does
anybody
dispute
that
where
i
come
from
that
qualifies
as
child
abuse
and
we
know
that
he
had
people
teaching
these
kids
how
to
kill
themselves
i
think
that
qualifies
as
abuse
and
im
not
criticizing
judge
sessions
because
i
dont
know
exactly
what
he
said
in
terms
of
madeleine
albright
madeleine
albright
has
made
no
public
statement
at
all
about
air
strikes
there
is
a
press
report
that
she
wrote
me
a
confidential
letter
in
which
she
expressed
her
or
memo
in
which
she
expressed
her
views
about
the
new
direction
we
should
take
in
response
to
my
request
to
all
the
senior
members
of
my
administration
to
let
me
know
what
they
thought
we
ought
to
do
next
and
i
have
heard
from
her
and
from
others
about
what
they
think
we
ought
to
do
next
and
im
not
going
to
discuss
the
recommendations
they
made
to
me
but
in
the
next
few
days
when
i
make
a
decision
about
what
to
do
then
i
will
announce
what
im
going
to
do
so
i
wouldnt
say
that
either
one
of
those
examples
qualifies
speaking
out
of
school
q
how
about
the
value
added
tax
mr
president
the
president
what
was
that
q
the
value
added
tax
mrs
rivlin
and
miss
shalala
both
said
that
they
thought
that
that
was
a
good
idea
the
president
i
dont
mind
them
saying
they
think
its
a
good
idea
there
are
all
kinds
of
arguments
for
it
on
policy
grounds
that
does
not
mean
that
we
have
decided
to
incorporate
it
in
the
health
care
debate
no
decision
has
been
made
on
that
and
i
have
no
objection
to
their
expressing
their
views
on
that
weve
had
a
lot
of
people
from
business
and
labor
come
to
us
saying
that
they
thought
that
tax
would
help
make
their
particular
industries
more
competitive
in
the
global
economy
i
took
no
that
wasnt
taking
a
line
against
an
administration
policy
q
mr
president
a
week
ago
a
group
of
gay
and
lesbian
representatives
came
out
of
a
meeting
with
you
and
expressed
in
the
most
ringing
terms
their
confidence
in
your
understanding
of
them
and
their
political
aspirations
and
their
belief
that
you
would
fulfill
those
aspirations
do
you
feel
now
that
you
will
be
able
to
meet
their
now
enhanced
expectations
the
president
well
i
dont
know
about
that
and
i
dont
know
what
their
it
depends
on
what
the
expectations
are
but
ill
tell
you
this
i
believe
that
this
countrys
policies
should
be
heavily
biased
in
favor
of
nondiscrimination
i
believe
when
you
tell
people
they
cant
do
certain
things
in
this
country
that
other
people
can
do
there
ought
to
be
an
overwhelming
and
compelling
reason
for
it
i
believe
we
need
the
services
of
all
of
our
people
and
i
have
said
that
consistently
and
not
as
a
political
proposition
the
first
time
this
issue
came
up
was
in
when
i
was
in
boston
i
was
just
asked
the
question
about
it
and
i
might
add
its
interesting
that
i
have
been
attacked
obviously
those
who
disagree
with
me
here
are
primarily
coming
from
the
political
right
in
america
when
i
was
governor
i
was
attacked
from
the
other
direction
for
sticking
up
for
the
rights
of
religious
fundamentalists
to
run
their
child
care
centers
and
to
practice
home
schooling
under
appropriate
safeguards
i
just
have
always
had
an
almost
libertarian
view
that
we
should
try
to
protect
the
rights
of
american
individual
citizens
to
live
up
to
the
fullest
of
their
capacities
and
im
going
to
stick
right
with
that
q
are
you
concerned
sir
that
you
may
have
generated
expectations
on
their
end
and
criticism
among
others
that
has
hamstrung
your
administration
in
the
sense
of
far
too
great
emphasis
on
this
issue
the
president
yes
but
i
have
not
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
it
its
gotten
a
lot
of
emphasis
in
other
quarters
and
in
the
press
ive
just
simply
taken
my
position
and
tried
to
see
it
through
and
thats
what
i
do
it
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
my
time
as
president
to
say
what
i
believe
in
and
what
i
intend
to
do
and
thats
what
ill
continue
to
do
q
mr
president
getting
back
to
the
situation
in
bosnia
and
we
understand
you
havent
made
any
final
decisions
on
new
options
previously
considered
unacceptable
but
the
two
most
commonly
heard
options
would
be
lifting
the
arms
embargo
to
enable
the
bosnian
muslims
to
defend
themselves
and
to
initiate
some
limited
air
strikes
perhaps
to
cut
off
supply
lines
without
telling
us
your
decision
presumably
you
havent
made
any
final
decisions
on
those
two
options
what
are
the
pros
and
cons
that
are
going
through
your
mind
right
now
and
will
weigh
heavily
on
your
final
decision
the
president
im
reluctant
to
get
into
this
there
are
those
are
two
of
the
options
there
are
some
other
options
that
have
been
considered
all
have
pluses
and
minuses
all
have
supporters
and
opponents
within
the
administration
and
in
the
congress
where
i
would
remind
you
heavy
consultations
will
be
required
to
embark
on
any
new
policy
i
do
believe
that
on
the
air
strike
issue
the
pronouncements
that
general
powell
has
made
generally
about
military
action
apply
there
if
you
take
action
if
the
united
states
takes
action
we
must
have
a
clearlydefined
objective
that
can
be
met
we
must
be
able
to
understand
it
and
its
limitations
must
be
clear
the
united
states
is
not
should
not
become
involved
as
a
partisan
in
a
war
with
regard
to
the
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
the
question
obviously
there
is
if
you
widen
the
capacity
of
people
to
fight
will
that
help
to
get
a
settlement
and
bring
about
peace
will
it
lead
to
more
bloodshed
what
kind
of
reaction
can
others
have
that
would
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
the
policy
but
i
think
both
of
them
deserve
some
serious
consideration
along
with
some
other
options
we
have
q
do
you
think
that
these
people
who
are
trying
to
get
us
into
war
in
bosnia
are
really
remembering
that
we
havent
taken
care
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
veterans
from
the
last
war
and
we
couldnt
take
care
of
our
prisoners
and
get
them
all
home
from
vietnam
and
now
many
of
them
are
coming
up
with
bills
for
treatment
of
agent
orange
how
can
we
afford
to
go
to
any
more
of
these
wars
the
president
well
i
think
thats
a
good
argument
against
the
united
states
itself
becoming
involved
as
a
belligerent
in
a
war
there
but
we
are
after
all
the
worlds
only
super
power
we
do
have
to
lead
the
world
and
there
is
a
very
serious
problem
of
systematic
ethnic
cleansing
in
the
former
yugoslavia
which
could
have
not
only
enormous
further
humanitarian
consequences
and
goodness
knows
there
have
been
many
but
also
could
have
other
practical
consequences
in
other
nearby
regions
where
the
same
sorts
of
ethnic
tensions
exist
q
did
you
make
any
kind
of
agreement
with
boris
yeltsin
to
hold
off
either
on
air
strikes
or
any
kind
of
aggressive
action
against
the
serbs
until
after
sunday
and
in
general
how
has
his
political
situation
affected
your
deliberation
on
bosnia
the
president
no
i
have
not
made
any
agreement
and
he
did
not
ask
for
that
we
never
even
discussed
that
interestingly
enough
the
russians
i
would
remind
you
in
the
middle
of
president
yeltsins
campaign
abstained
from
our
attempt
to
get
tougher
sanctions
through
the
united
nations
in
what
i
thought
was
the
proper
decision
for
them
and
one
that
the
united
states
and
im
sure
the
rest
of
the
free
world
very
much
appreciated
q
do
you
wish
mr
president
that
youd
become
more
involved
in
the
planning
of
the
waco
operation
and
how
would
you
handle
that
situation
differently
now
the
president
i
dont
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
president
should
become
involved
in
the
planning
of
those
kinds
of
things
at
that
detail
one
of
the
things
that
im
sure
will
come
out
when
we
look
into
this
is
the
questions
will
be
asked
and
answered
did
all
of
us
who
up
the
line
of
command
ask
the
questions
we
should
have
asked
and
get
the
answers
we
should
have
gotten
and
i
look
forward
to
that
but
at
the
time
i
have
to
say
as
i
did
before
the
first
thing
i
did
after
the
atf
agents
were
killed
once
we
knew
that
the
fbi
was
going
to
go
in
was
to
ask
that
the
military
be
consulted
because
of
the
quasi
as
least
military
nature
of
the
conflict
given
the
resources
that
koresh
had
in
his
compound
and
their
obvious
willingness
to
use
them
and
then
on
the
day
before
the
action
i
asked
the
questions
of
the
attorney
general
which
i
have
reported
to
you
previously
and
which
at
the
time
i
thought
were
sufficient
i
have
as
i
said
im
sure
i
leave
it
to
others
to
make
the
suggestions
about
whether
there
are
other
questions
i
should
have
asked
q
mr
president
what
is
your
assessment
of
director
sessions
role
in
the
waco
affair
and
have
you
made
a
decision
on
his
future
and
if
you
havent
will
you
give
him
a
personal
hearing
before
you
do
decide
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
have
no
assessment
of
his
role
since
i
had
no
direct
contact
with
him
and
i
mean
no
negative
or
positive
inference
i
have
no
assessment
there
i
stand
by
what
i
said
before
about
my
general
high
regard
for
the
fbi
and
im
waiting
for
a
recommendation
from
the
attorney
general
about
what
to
do
with
the
direction
of
the
fbi
q
mr
president
since
you
said
that
one
side
in
bosnia
conflict
represents
inhumanity
that
the
holocaust
carried
to
the
nth
degree
why
do
you
then
tell
us
that
the
united
states
cannot
take
a
partisan
view
in
this
war
the
president
well
i
said
that
the
principle
of
ethnic
cleansing
is
something
we
ought
to
stand
up
against
that
does
not
mean
that
the
united
states
or
the
united
nations
can
enter
a
war
in
effect
to
redraw
the
lines
geographical
lines
of
republics
within
what
was
yugoslavia
or
that
that
would
ultimately
be
successful
i
think
what
the
united
states
has
to
do
is
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
there
is
some
way
consistent
with
forcing
the
people
to
resolve
their
own
difficulties
we
can
stand
up
to
and
stop
ethnic
cleansing
and
that
is
obviously
the
difficulty
we
are
wrestling
with
this
is
clearly
the
most
difficult
foreign
policy
problem
we
face
and
that
all
of
our
allies
face
and
if
it
were
easy
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
solved
before
we
have
tried
to
do
more
in
the
last
days
than
was
previously
done
it
has
clearly
not
been
enough
to
stop
the
serbian
aggression
and
we
are
now
looking
at
what
else
we
can
do
q
yesterday
you
specifically
criticized
the
roosevelt
administration
for
not
having
bombed
the
railroads
to
the
concentration
camps
and
things
that
were
near
military
targets
arent
there
steps
like
that
that
would
not
involve
conflict
direct
conflict
or
partisan
belligerence
that
you
might
consider
the
president
there
may
be
i
would
remind
you
that
the
circumstances
were
somewhat
different
we
were
then
at
war
with
germany
at
the
time
and
thats
what
made
that
whole
incident
so
series
of
incidents
so
perplexing
but
we
have
as
i
say
weve
got
all
of
our
options
under
review
q
the
diplomatic
initiative
on
haiti
is
on
the
verge
of
collapse
what
can
you
do
to
salvage
it
short
of
a
fullscale
military
operation
the
president
well
you
may
know
something
i
dont
thats
not
what
our
people
tell
me
i
think
mr
caputo
and
ambassador
pezzullo
have
done
together
a
good
job
the
thing
keeps
going
back
and
forth
because
of
the
people
who
are
involved
with
the
de
facto
government
there
its
obvious
what
their
concerns
are
they
were
the
same
concerns
that
led
to
the
ouster
of
aristide
in
the
first
place
and
president
aristide
we
feel
should
be
restored
to
power
were
working
toward
that
i
get
a
report
on
that
we
discuss
it
at
least
three
times
a
week
and
im
convinced
that
were
going
to
prevail
there
and
be
successful
i
do
believe
that
theres
every
reason
to
think
that
there
will
have
to
be
some
sort
of
multilateral
presence
to
try
to
guarantee
the
security
and
the
freedom
from
violence
of
people
on
both
sides
of
the
ledger
while
we
try
to
establish
the
conditions
of
ongoing
civilized
society
but
i
believe
were
going
to
prevail
there
q
mr
president
would
you
care
to
make
your
assessment
of
the
first
days
before
we
make
one
for
you
laughter
the
president
well
ill
say
if
i
believe
first
of
all
we
passed
the
budget
resolution
in
record
time
that
was
the
biggest
issue
that
confirmed
the
direction
of
the
administration
and
confirmed
the
commitments
of
the
campaign
that
we
could
both
bring
the
deficit
down
and
increase
investment
and
that
we
could
do
it
by
specific
spending
cuts
and
by
raising
taxes
almost
all
of
which
come
from
the
highest
income
people
in
this
society
reversing
a
trend
in
which
most
of
the
tax
burdens
were
borne
by
the
middle
class
whose
incomes
were
going
down
when
their
taxes
were
going
up
while
the
deficit
went
from
trillion
to
trillion
the
total
national
debt
and
the
deficit
continued
to
go
up
we
have
a
low
in
interest
rates
from
mortgages
we
have
lower
interest
rates
across
the
board
we
have
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
flooding
back
into
this
economy
as
people
refinance
their
debt
we
have
established
a
new
environmental
policy
which
is
dramatically
different
the
secretary
of
education
has
worked
with
me
and
with
others
and
with
the
governors
to
establish
a
new
approach
in
education
that
focuses
on
tough
standards
as
well
as
increasing
opportunity
we
have
done
an
enormous
amount
of
work
on
political
reform
on
campaign
finance
and
lobbying
reform
and
i
have
imposed
tough
ethics
requirements
on
my
own
administrations
officials
these
things
are
consistent
with
not
only
what
i
said
id
do
in
the
campaign
but
with
turning
the
country
around
the
vice
president
is
heading
a
task
force
which
will
literally
change
the
way
the
federal
government
operates
and
make
it
much
more
responsive
to
the
citizens
of
this
country
we
are
working
on
a
whole
range
of
other
things
the
welfare
reform
initiative
to
move
people
from
welfare
to
work
and
of
course
a
massive
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
the
health
care
issue
which
is
a
huge
economic
and
personal
security
problem
for
millions
of
americans
so
i
think
it
is
amazing
how
much
has
been
done
more
will
be
done
we
also
passed
the
family
leave
bill
a
version
of
the
motor
voter
bill
that
has
not
come
out
of
conference
back
to
me
yet
and
everything
has
been
passed
except
the
stimulus
program
so
i
think
were
doing
fine
and
were
moving
in
the
right
direction
i
feel
good
about
it
q
sir
a
followup
wouldnt
you
say
though
that
one
of
your
biggest
initiatives
aid
to
soviet
russia
is
now
practically
finished
if
we
cant
pass
a
stimulus
bill
in
our
own
country
how
can
we
do
it
for
them
the
president
let
me
recast
the
question
a
little
bit
its
a
good
question
laughter
its
a
good
question
but
to
be
fair
weve
got
to
recast
it
we
have
already
the
first
round
of
aid
to
the
soviet
to
nonsoviet
russia
to
a
democratic
russia
is
plainly
going
to
go
through
the
first
billion
the
aid
that
we
agreed
with
our
partners
in
the
to
provide
through
the
international
financial
institutions
which
is
a
big
dollar
item
is
plainly
going
to
go
through
the
question
is
can
we
get
any
more
aid
for
russia
that
requires
a
new
appropriation
by
the
united
states
congress
and
that
is
a
question
i
think
mary
that
will
be
resolved
in
the
weeks
ahead
in
part
by
what
happens
to
the
american
workers
and
their
jobs
and
their
future
i
think
the
two
things
will
be
tied
by
many
members
of
congress
q
the
tailhook
report
came
out
this
morning
documenting
horrendous
and
nearlycriminal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
navy
how
much
did
you
discuss
the
incident
and
what
might
be
done
about
it
with
your
nominee
to
be
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
president
first
let
me
comment
a
little
on
that
the
inspector
generals
report
details
conduct
which
is
wrong
and
which
has
no
place
in
the
armed
services
and
i
expect
the
report
to
be
acted
on
in
the
appropriate
way
i
also
want
to
say
to
the
american
people
and
to
all
of
you
that
the
report
should
be
taken
for
what
it
is
a
very
disturbing
list
of
allegations
which
will
have
to
be
thoroughly
examined
it
should
not
be
taken
as
a
general
indictment
of
the
united
states
navy
or
of
all
the
fine
people
who
serve
there
it
is
very
specific
in
its
allegations
and
it
will
be
pursued
the
only
thing
i
said
to
the
secretarydesignate
of
the
navy
and
the
only
thing
i
should
have
said
to
him
i
think
is
that
i
expected
him
to
take
the
report
and
to
do
his
duty
and
i
believe
he
will
do
that
q
mr
president
to
back
to
russia
for
just
a
minute
the
latest
poll
show
that
mr
yeltsin
will
probably
win
his
vote
of
confidence
but
there
seems
to
be
a
real
tossup
on
whether
or
not
voters
are
going
to
endorse
his
economic
reforms
the
president
i
understand
that
q
can
you
live
with
a
split
laughter
can
you
live
with
a
split
decision
though
or
do
you
need
both
passed
in
order
to
then
build
support
for
russian
aid
the
president
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question
is
for
the
united
states
the
key
question
should
be
that
which
is
posed
to
any
democracy
which
is
who
wins
the
election
if
he
wins
the
election
if
he
is
ratified
by
the
russian
people
to
continue
as
their
president
then
i
think
we
should
do
our
best
to
work
with
him
toward
reform
you
know
we
had
a
lot
of
other
countries
here
for
the
holocaust
museum
dedication
their
leaders
were
here
leaders
from
eastern
europe
leaders
from
at
least
one
republic
of
the
former
soviet
union
all
of
them
having
terrible
economic
challenges
as
they
convert
from
a
communist
command
and
control
economy
to
a
market
economy
in
a
world
where
theres
economic
slowdown
everywhere
and
in
a
world
in
which
theres
economic
slowdown
and
difficulty
all
leaders
will
have
trouble
having
their
policies
be
popular
in
a
poll
because
they
havent
produced
the
results
that
the
people
so
earnestly
yearn
for
you
can
understand
that
but
if
they
have
confidence
in
the
leadership
i
think
thats
all
we
can
ask
and
the
united
states
will
if
the
russian
people
ratify
him
as
their
president
and
stick
with
him
then
the
united
states
will
continue
to
work
with
him
i
think
he
is
a
genuine
democrat
small
d
and
genuinely
committed
to
reform
i
think
that
we
should
support
that
q
mr
president
mr
perot
has
come
out
strongly
in
what
is
perceived
behind
the
line
against
a
free
trade
agreement
nafta
how
hard
are
you
going
to
fight
for
this
free
trade
agreement
and
when
do
you
expect
to
see
it
accomplished
the
president
i
think
well
have
the
agreement
ready
in
the
fairly
near
future
you
know
our
people
are
still
working
with
the
mexican
government
and
with
the
canadians
on
the
side
agreements
were
trying
to
work
out
what
the
environmental
agreement
will
say
what
the
labor
agreement
will
say
and
then
what
the
fairest
way
to
deal
with
enforcement
is
the
mexicans
say
and
there
is
some
merit
to
their
position
that
theyre
worried
about
transferring
their
sovereignty
in
enforcement
to
a
multilateral
commission
even
in
the
united
states
to
be
fair
we
have
some
folks
who
are
worried
about
that
about
giving
that
up
on
the
other
hand
if
were
going
to
have
an
environmental
agreement
and
a
labor
standards
agreement
that
means
something
then
there
has
to
be
ultimately
some
consequences
for
violating
them
so
what
were
trying
to
do
is
to
agree
on
an
approach
which
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
violations
if
you
keep
on
violating
it
past
a
certain
point
maybe
not
an
isolated
incident
but
a
pattern
of
violation
there
is
going
to
be
some
enforcement
there
must
be
consequences
and
were
working
out
the
details
of
that
but
i
still
feel
quite
good
about
it
and
this
is
just
an
area
where
i
disagree
with
mr
perot
and
with
others
i
think
that
we
will
win
big
if
we
have
a
fair
agreement
that
integrates
more
closely
the
mexican
economy
and
the
american
economy
and
leads
us
from
there
to
chile
to
other
market
economies
in
latin
america
and
gives
us
a
bigger
world
in
which
to
trade
i
think
thats
the
only
way
a
rich
country
can
grow
richer
if
you
look
at
what
japan
and
other
countries
in
the
pacific
are
doing
to
reach
out
in
their
own
region
its
a
pretty
good
lesson
to
us
that
we
had
better
worry
about
how
to
build
those
bridges
in
our
own
area
so
this
is
an
idea
battle
you
know
youve
got
a
lot
of
questions
and
i
want
to
answer
them
all
but
let
me
say
not
every
one
of
these
things
can
be
distilled
simply
into
politics
you
know
whos
for
this
and
whos
for
that
and
if
this
person
is
for
this
somebody
else
has
got
to
be
for
that
a
lot
of
these
things
honestly
involved
real
debates
over
ideas
over
whos
right
and
wrong
about
the
world
toward
which
were
moving
and
the
answers
are
not
selfevident
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
wanted
to
run
for
president
is
i
wanted
to
sort
of
open
the
floodgates
for
debating
these
ideas
so
that
we
could
try
to
change
in
the
appropriate
way
so
i
just
have
a
difference
of
opinion
i
believe
that
the
concept
of
nafta
is
sound
even
though
as
you
know
i
thought
that
the
details
needed
to
be
improved
q
mr
president
there
was
a
tremendous
flurry
of
interest
earlier
this
month
in
the
russian
document
that
purported
to
show
that
the
vietnamese
had
held
back
american
prisoners
general
vessey
has
now
said
publicly
that
while
the
document
itself
was
authentic
he
believes
that
it
was
incorrect
do
you
have
a
personal
view
at
this
point
about
that
issue
and
more
broadly
do
you
believe
that
in
fact
the
vietnamese
did
return
all
the
american
prisoners
at
the
time
of
the
paris
peace
accord
the
president
first
let
me
say
i
saw
general
vessey
before
he
went
to
vietnam
and
after
he
returned
and
i
have
a
high
regard
for
him
and
i
appreciate
his
willingness
to
serve
his
country
in
this
way
as
to
whether
the
document
had
any
basis
in
fact
let
me
say
that
the
government
of
vietnam
was
more
forthcoming
than
it
had
been
in
the
past
and
gave
us
some
documents
that
would
tend
to
undermine
the
validity
of
the
russian
documents
claim
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong
we
are
having
it
basically
evaluated
at
this
time
and
when
we
complete
the
evaluation
well
tell
you
and
of
course
we
want
to
tell
the
families
of
those
who
were
missing
in
action
or
who
were
pows
i
think
that
well
be
able
to
make
some
progress
in
eliminating
some
of
the
questions
about
the
outstanding
cases
as
a
result
of
this
last
interchange
but
i
cannot
say
that
im
fully
satisfied
that
we
know
all
that
we
need
to
know
there
are
still
some
cases
that
we
dont
know
the
answer
to
but
i
do
believe
were
making
some
progress
i
was
encouraged
by
the
last
trip
q
id
like
to
follow
up
on
that
before
the
us
normalizes
relations
allows
trade
to
go
forward
do
you
have
to
be
personally
sure
that
every
case
has
been
resolved
or
would
you
be
willing
to
go
forward
on
the
basis
that
while
it
may
take
years
to
resolve
these
cases
the
vietnamese
have
made
sufficient
offerings
to
us
to
confirm
good
faith
the
president
a
lot
of
experts
say
you
can
never
resolve
every
case
every
one
that
we
couldnt
resolve
all
the
cases
for
them
and
that
there
are
still
some
cases
that
have
not
been
factually
resolved
going
back
to
the
second
world
war
but
what
i
would
have
to
be
convinced
of
is
that
we
had
gone
a
long
way
toward
resolving
every
case
that
could
be
resolved
at
this
moment
in
time
and
that
there
was
a
complete
open
and
unrestricted
commitment
to
continue
to
do
everything
that
could
be
done
always
to
keep
resolving
those
cases
and
were
not
there
yet
again
i
have
to
be
guided
a
little
bit
by
people
who
know
a
lot
about
this
and
i
confess
to
being
much
more
heavily
influenced
by
the
families
of
the
people
whose
lives
were
lost
there
or
whose
lives
remain
in
question
than
by
the
commercial
interest
and
the
other
things
which
seem
so
compelling
in
this
moment
i
just
am
very
influenced
by
how
the
families
feel
q
your
economic
stimulus
package
are
you
doing
some
kind
of
reality
check
now
and
scaling
back
some
of
your
plans
your
legislative
plans
for
the
coming
year
including
the
crime
bill
the
health
care
initiative
and
other
things
are
there
any
plans
to
do
that
and
also
did
you
underestimate
the
power
of
senator
bob
dole
the
president
no
what
i
underestimated
was
the
extent
to
which
what
i
thought
was
a
fairly
selfevident
case
particularly
after
we
stayed
below
the
spending
caps
approved
by
this
congress
including
the
republicans
who
were
in
this
congress
last
year
when
we
had
already
passed
a
budget
resolution
which
called
for
over
billion
in
deficit
reduction
when
they
had
voted
repeatedly
for
supplemental
appropriations
to
help
foreign
governments
i
thought
at
least
four
of
them
would
vote
to
break
cloture
and
i
underestimated
that
i
did
not
have
an
adequate
strategy
of
dealing
with
that
i
also
thought
that
if
i
made
a
goodfaith
effort
to
negotiate
and
to
compromise
that
it
would
not
be
rebuffed
instead
every
time
i
offered
something
they
reduced
the
offer
that
they
had
previously
been
talking
to
the
majority
leader
about
so
it
was
a
strange
set
of
events
but
i
think
what
happened
was
what
was
a
significant
part
of
our
plan
but
not
the
major
part
of
it
acquired
a
political
connotation
that
got
out
of
proportion
to
the
merits
so
that
a
lot
of
republicans
were
saying
to
me
privately
mr
president
id
like
to
be
for
this
but
i
cant
now
and
were
all
strung
out
and
were
divided
and
i
think
we
need
to
do
a
reality
check
as
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
let
me
go
back
to
what
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
from
our
folks
and
from
our
friends
in
the
senate
on
and
republicans
or
democrats
is
what
could
i
have
done
differently
to
make
it
come
out
differently
because
the
real
losers
here
were
not
the
president
and
the
administration
the
real
losers
were
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
wont
have
jobs
now
we
could
have
put
another
kids
to
work
this
summer
i
mean
we
could
have
done
a
lot
of
good
things
with
that
money
and
i
think
that
is
very
very
sad
and
it
became
more
political
than
it
should
have
but
the
underlying
rationale
i
dont
think
holds
a
lot
of
water
that
it
was
deficit
spending
that
just
wont
wash
q
and
redo
the
president
no
i
mean
you
know
for
example
you
mentioned
the
crime
bill
i
think
it
would
be
a
real
mistake
not
to
pass
the
crime
bill
i
mean
the
crime
bill
was
almost
on
the
point
of
passage
last
year
and
they
were
all
fighting
over
the
brady
bill
surely
surely
after
what
we
have
been
through
in
this
country
just
in
the
last
three
months
with
the
kind
of
mindless
violence
we
have
seen
we
can
pass
a
bill
requiring
people
to
go
through
a
waiting
period
before
they
buy
a
handgun
and
surely
we
can
see
that
we
need
more
police
officers
on
the
street
thats
another
thing
that
i
really
believe
that
once
we
move
some
of
that
money
not
all
but
some
of
it
up
into
this
jobs
package
to
make
some
of
the
jobs
rehiring
police
officers
on
the
street
whod
been
laid
off
that
would
be
a
compelling
case
i
mean
people
are
scared
in
this
country
and
i
think
we
need
to
go
forward
i
feel
very
strongly
that
we
need
to
go
forward
on
the
crime
bill
q
mr
president
back
to
the
tailhook
report
for
a
second
that
report
contained
very
strong
criticism
of
the
navys
senior
leadership
in
general
but
did
not
name
any
of
the
senior
officers
do
you
believe
that
the
senior
officers
who
are
implicated
in
this
including
admiral
kelso
who
was
there
one
night
in
las
vegas
should
they
be
disciplined
and
do
you
believe
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
the
names
of
the
senior
officers
the
president
you
should
know
that
under
the
rules
of
law
which
apply
to
this
i
am
in
the
chain
of
command
there
is
now
an
inspector
generals
report
and
the
law
must
take
its
course
if
i
were
to
answer
that
question
i
might
prejudice
any
decisions
which
might
be
later
made
in
this
case
i
dont
really
think
i
think
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
i
have
already
said
i
was
very
disturbed
by
the
specific
allegations
in
the
inspector
generals
report
and
i
want
appropriate
action
to
be
taken
until
the
proper
procedures
have
a
chance
to
kick
in
and
appropriate
action
is
taken
i
have
been
advised
that
because
i
am
the
commanderinchief
i
have
to
be
very
careful
about
what
i
say
so
as
not
to
prejudice
the
rights
of
anybody
against
whom
any
action
might
proceed
or
to
prejudice
the
case
in
any
other
way
either
pro
or
con
so
i
cant
say
any
more
except
to
say
that
i
want
this
thing
handled
in
an
appropriate
and
thorough
way
q
mr
president
could
i
ask
you
for
a
clarification
on
bosnia
you
said
that
you
were
not
considering
introduction
of
american
forces
does
that
include
any
air
forces
as
well
as
ground
forces
sir
the
president
i
said
ground
forces
q
you
said
ground
forces
could
i
ask
you
sir
if
you
fear
that
using
us
air
strikes
might
draw
the
united
states
into
a
ground
war
there
the
president
i
just
dont
want
to
discuss
our
evaluation
of
the
options
anymore
ive
told
you
that
theres
never
been
a
serious
discussion
in
this
country
about
the
introduction
of
ground
forces
into
an
ongoing
conflict
there
q
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
gays
in
washington
this
weekend
for
the
march
did
you
ever
reconsider
your
decision
to
leave
town
for
this
weekend
did
you
ever
consider
in
any
way
participating
in
some
of
the
activities
the
president
no
q
why
not
the
president
because
i
and
basically
i
wouldnt
participate
in
other
marches
i
think
once
you
become
president
on
balance
except
under
unusual
circumstances
that
is
not
what
should
be
done
but
more
importantly
im
going
to
the
american
society
of
newspaper
editors
a
trip
that
presumably
most
of
you
would
want
me
to
make
to
try
to
focus
anew
on
what
i
think
are
the
fundamental
issues
at
stake
for
our
country
right
now
and
i
expect
that
i
will
say
something
about
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
americans
have
come
here
asking
for
a
climate
that
is
free
of
discrimination
asking
basically
to
be
able
to
work
hard
and
live
by
the
rules
and
be
treated
like
other
american
citizens
if
they
do
that
and
just
that
and
thats
always
been
my
position
not
only
for
the
gays
who
will
be
here
but
for
others
as
well

you
very
much

that

to
step
in
and
help
shutting
down
selective
service
would
cost
good
jobs
and
we
cant
do
that
what
we
really
need
is
to
involve
selective
service
in
a
more
closely
directed
manner
we
need
the
selective
service
involved
in
environmental
protection
highspeed
rail
commuter
aircraft
civil
rights
national
service
and
health
care
every
dollar
we
put
into
selective
service
now
will
get
us
less
spending
in
future
i
really
believe
now
to
think
about
it
that
selective
service
is
longpast
due
for
the
creation
of
a
cabinet
position
your
not
beyond
hope
just
get
back
on
americas
side
and
start
doing
your
part
for
change
what
bill
needs
from
you
now
is
support
for
the
economic
stimulus
and
health
care
reform
you
need
to
devote
all
your
energies
to
fighting
gridlock
and
supporting
change
get

after
all
the

has
been
banished

the

is
past

may
someday

as

i
thumbed
through
the
janus
report
in
a
bookstore
recently
looking
for
a
clue
about
their
methodology
they
were
very
unclear
about
it
but
as
far
as
i
could
tell
they
relied
on
their
professional
associates
in
the
psychotherapy
profession
to
provide
the
subjects
interviews
and
numbers
if
so
this
would
hardly
represent
an
average
crosssection
i
posted
to
usenet
at
the
time
asking
for
more
data
about
their
methodology
but
answer
came
there
none
i
must
have
been
out
of
my
mind
for
even
asking
for
factual
information
on
usenet
no
one
is
presumably
going
to
say
theyre
gay
if
theyre
not
but
some
no
doubt
are
going
to
hide
their
homosexuality
in
surveys
thus
the
is
a
lower
limit
this
is
the
problem
people
have
to
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
anonymity
of
a
study
before
they
can
counted
on
to
speak
freely
about
stuff
like
that
but
i
agree
that
if
someones
going
to
lie
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
a
gay
person
claiming
to
be
straight
rather
than
the
other
way
around
i
still
say
that
weighing
all
the
evidence
gives
a
most
likely
percentage
between
and
i
dont
see
why
theres
any
more
evidence
for
this
figure
than
any
other
it
seems
totally
arbitrary

the

hasnt

with
the

what

did
it

the

money

in

it

come

if
much

some
of

true
youd
have
to
take

for

for
tolerating

given
that
our

during

when
there
were

remember
that
most
of

make

look

even
you
dont
go
that
far
sorry
but
id
have
to
differ
the
canadianbashing
wrt

the

insurance
system
is
largely
with
little
evidence
or
prompting
having
kept
up
with
this
debate
on
the
net
for
some
months
just
about
all
the
criticism
of
the
canadian

has
misquoted

misinterpreted
even
the
anticanadian
propaganda
put

the

the

in

such

the

most

room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
president
is
going
to
come
out
at
pm
with
your
indulgence
i
think
what
wed
like
to
do
is
have
the
president
award
the
national
teachers
award
first
and
then
have
the
teacher
leave
or
whatever
and
then
hell
make
a
statement
on
waco
and
take
a
couple
questions
so
if
we
can
just
hold
off
going
live
and
all
that
until
thats
done
it
probably
will
work
out
a
lot
better
q
if
youll
give
us
the
time
thats
the
problem
q
weve
got
a
twominute
warning
problem
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
it
is
a
problem
its
about
pm
q
the
teacher
would
walk
off
and
then
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
im
just
trying
to
work
this
out
here
i
think
thats
the
best
way
to
handle
it
q
can
i
ask
you
a
series
of
questions
about
the
way
the
president
handled
the
notifications
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
did
you
for
instance
talk
to
the
justice
department
about
who
would
come
out
and
discuss
what
had
happened
in
waco
and
whether
it
should
be
the
attorney
general
or
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
why
dont
we
just
take
a
step
even
farther
back
from
that
and
look
at
the
whole
sequence
of
events
on
the
contact
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
as
you
know
and
as
weve
said
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
sunday
afternoon
they
had
a
good
discussion
about
minutes
the
attorney
general
informed
the
president
of
what
she
wanted
to
do
he
raised
no
objections
obviously
she
had
the
implicit
authority
from
the
president
to
go
forward
he
raised
no
objections
she
went
forward
they
had
a
discussion
of
a
general
nature
about
the
incident
again
yesterday
morning
around
am
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
they
had
a
brief
discussion
over
what
was
happening
in
waco
as
you
know
this
was
before
the
fire
broke
out
at
the
compound
and
i
think
that
was
why
there
was
some
just
some
confusion
i
think
that
she
was
confusing
in
her
minds
before
and
after
the
fire
not
the
actual
day
when
they
spoke
then
there
was
a
number
of
contacts
at
a
number
of
different
levels
in
the
white
house
yesterday
afternoon
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
they
were
informing
us
of
their
decisions
what
they
would
like
to
do
there
was
an
fbi
briefing
in
waco
the
attorney
general
had
her
press
conference
the
president
then
issued
a
statement
after
that
frankly
yesterday
afternoon
you
know
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
confusion
over
exactly
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
and
i
think
that
we
wanted
to
be
very
careful
not
to
have
the
president
say
anything
until
we
had
a
much
better
sense
of
what
was
actually
happening
on
the
ground
once
we
were
fairly
clear
on
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
the
president
issued
a
statement
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
yesterday
evening
q
at
what
hour
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
quite
late
i
believe
it
was
after
he
returned
from
the
holocaust
museum
he
took
a
tour
of
the
holocaust
museum
last
night
q
and
he
went
out
to
dinner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
briefly
yes
he
went
to
dinner
and
then
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
last
night
i
dont
know
the
exact
time
i
think
it
was
relatively
late
and
he
just
said
i
think
as
dee
dee
has
reported
that
he
just
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
thought
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
very
well
that
she
did
a
good
job
in
a
tough
situation
and
that
she
should
try
and
get
some
sleep
he
then
again
spoke
with
her
this
morning
about
the
followup
in
waco
and
about
what
theyre
going
to
do
this
afternoon
as
you
know
the
president
will
have
an
announcement
to
make
at
q
did
he
ever
talk
with
webb
hubbell
yesterday
last
night
or
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
was
webb
hubbell
the
point
man
for
the
white
house
mr
stephanopoulos
webb
hubbell
is
the
general
white
house
liaison
and
several
people
talked
to
webb
the
attorney
general
was
running
the
operation
q
did
he
tell
her
that
she
should
sleep
well
that
she
had
done
a
good
job
or
he
just
tell
her
that
she
should
get
some
sleep
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
sleep
well
done
a
good
job
i
dont
know
the
exact
words
i
think
that
sounds
right
q
i
mean
sleep
well
has
implications
as
to
conscience
and
whether
she
should
feel
badly
about
it
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
i
think
everybody
feels
badly
when
you
have
a
situation
when
q
i
understand
that
but
whether
the
issue
of
blame
is
brought
up
in
that
phraseology
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
the
spirit
no
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
spirit
with
which
it
was
offered
was
that
the
entire
administration
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
had
to
face
a
very
difficult
decision
a
very
difficult
situation
yesterday
and
that
he
thought
that
she
had
handled
it
well
as
best
as
she
could
and
q
well
does
he
think
it
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
just
speaking
of
warm
words
to
a
friend
q
does
he
think
the
situation
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
q
in
retrospect
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
stands
by
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
the
decisions
of
the
attorney
general
he
accepts
full
responsibility
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
we
all
want
to
look
to
the
future
and
figure
out
what
exactly
happened
do
a
full
review
and
make
sure
we
do
what
we
can
to
make
sure
this
doesnt
happen
this
kind
of
thing
doesnt
happen
again
or
at
least
we
know
how
to
handle
it
q
how
much
did
he
know
about
what
she
was
going
to
go
ahead
with
i
know
that
she
made
the
case
to
him
explained
outlined
the
case
for
action
did
she
say
to
him
on
sunday
precisely
what
action
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
specific
operational
detail
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
i
think
that
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
action
about
the
advisability
of
action
i
think
as
she
noted
he
asked
a
few
general
questions
just
trying
to
get
a
sense
of
how
things
were
considered
but
it
wasnt
minutebyminute
detail
of
how
the
operation
q
well
was
it
we
are
going
in
is
it
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
i
mean
what
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
it
was
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
some
action
that
would
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
hopefully
spur
them
towards
some
sort
of
movement
out
q
george
was
there
ever
a
conscious
political
decision
made
or
even
a
discussion
about
distancing
the
president
from
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
we
were
in
close
contact
with
the
justice
department
the
president
accepts
responsibility
for
this
at
the
same
time
i
mean
we
just
wanted
to
be
very
very
clear
about
how
this
happened
and
be
as
factual
as
we
could
be
on
how
the
decisions
were
made
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
on
the
ground
to
make
recommendations
the
attorney
general
has
operational
control
over
this
the
president
obviously
accepts
responsibility
for
all
of
this
and
he
stands
by
the
attorney
general
q
george
there
was
a
report
on
the
television
today
and
i
dont
know
more
than
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
cult
had
said
going
into
a
courthouse
that
the
fbi
had
started
the
fire
and
not
themselves
there
was
also
a
picture
yesterday
on
the
tv
of
a
smashing
into
the
building
where
the
fire
broke
out
and
my
question
is
is
the
white
house
absolutely
certain
that
this
fire
was
mr
stephanopoulos
all
the
evidence
we
have
is
that
this
fire
was
started
by
david
koresh
and
those
inside
the
compound
every
bit
of
evidence
we
have
q
did
the
president
ask
the
attorney
general
why
do
this
now
why
this
particular
date
and
did
he
ask
about
possible
consequences
of
either
death
or
injury
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
the
specific
questions
he
had
general
questions
about
how
the
decision
was
going
about
being
made
q
those
are
general
questions
and
did
he
ask
generally
why
now
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
asked
have
you
considered
all
of
the
consequences
have
you
considered
the
recommendations
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
the
question
why
now
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
that
specific
question
q
did
she
tell
him
why
now
in
terms
of
the
stuff
thats
come
out
since
then
about
the
information
provided
by
the
listening
device
about
koresh
getting
increasingly
more
violent
mr
stephanopoulos
again
im
not
certain
how
much
specific
detail
they
got
into
i
know
that
she
generally
said
that
this
is
the
recommendation
shes
prepared
to
make
i
mean
the
decision
shes
prepared
to
make
its
based
on
the
recommendations
she
was
receiving
from
the
field
and
after
intensive
questioning
of
those
involved
again
i
do
not
know
how
precisely
detailed
it
was
beyond
that
q
what
is
the
presidents
understanding
why
yesterday
one
of
the
people
who
went
into
the
compound
a
couple
weeks
ago
came
out
over
the
weekend
with
some
speculation
that
he
may
have
told
law
enforcement
people
something
that
precipitated
this
action
why
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
i
think
what
we
can
go
to
is
what
the
fbi
and
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
were
indications
that
those
inside
the
compound
were
at
some
danger
it
was
clear
that
the
negotiations
had
broken
down
and
it
was
the
judgment
of
the
experts
involved
in
the
negotiations
that
the
situation
was
not
going
to
get
any
better
at
all
there
was
also
some
concern
over
the
vulnerability
of
the
agents
themselves
who
had
been
working
long
beyond
the
time
that
these
teams
normally
have
to
work
and
as
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
was
some
concern
over
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
replacements
in
place
who
could
stand
in
for
them
and
there
was
a
concern
over
the
safety
all
of
these
factors
came
into
play
they
also
considered
the
advice
of
a
number
of
psychologists
and
other
experts
on
david
koresh
and
those
in
the
compound
i
would
just
go
back
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
said
you
have
to
make
the
best
judgment
you
can
given
the
information
you
have
at
the
time
they
did
obviously
we
all
regret
the
loss
of
life
its
a
terribly
unfortunate
situation
we
all
wish
it
could
have
turned
out
differently
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
judgments
that
were
made
at
the
time
q
george
when
did
the
president
know
that
they
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
was
it
before
the
assault
on
the
compound
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
know
i
dont
believe
he
was
given
a
lot
of
detail
on
exactly
how
the
operation
would
go
i
just
dont
know
q
along
that
point
george
can
you
say
whether
the
plan
was
presented
to
the
president
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
way
to
end
the
standoff
one
way
or
the
other
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
presented
as
a
way
to
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
we
all
hoped
as
a
way
to
move
some
of
those
out
and
bring
it
in
it
wasnt
presented
as
tomorrow
is
dday
this
is
it
q
is
the
president
satisfied
that
a
he
had
all
this
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
and
b
that
janet
reno
had
all
the
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
i
think
hes
satisfied
that
they
were
acting
on
the
best
advice
and
the
best
information
they
had
and
hes
not
secondguessing
it
in
any
way
whatsoever
q
george
was
there
a
gap
between
conversations
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
in
other
words
they
spoke
at
am
and
they
didnt
speak
again
until
clinton
got
back
from
dinner
at
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
likely
yes
q
did
he
call
her
what
time
did
she
call
was
there
a
gap
between
when
she
called
him
i
mean
was
he
at
dinner
when
she
called
and
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
no
i
think
he
called
her
last
night
i
couldnt
swear
to
it
but
i
believe
he
called
her
last
night
he
just
wanted
to
talk
to
her
q
what
was
going
on
mr
stephanopoulos
not
that
i
know
of
no
q
what
do
you
know
about
the
situation
now
everyone
has
perished
who
except
eight
or
nine
and
do
you
know
any
of
the
other
details
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
any
more
details
than
the
fbi
reported
in
waco
q
watching
cnn
or
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
is
going
on
if
he
wasnt
talking
to
his
attorney
general
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
was
going
on
here
i
mean
with
all
due
respect
to
cnn
is
that
how
he
was
doing
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
there
was
also
as
i
said
several
people
in
the
white
house
were
in
constant
contact
with
their
counterparts
at
justice
to
have
the
full
and
complete
information
q
who
were
those
contacts
i
mean
was
it
mack
mclarty
webb
hubbell
how
was
the
president
being
kept
informed
thats
not
a
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
mack
was
in
contact
with
webb
i
spoke
with
several
people
at
the
justice
department
i
believe
bruce
lindsey
spoke
with
people
at
the
justice
department
either
bernie
or
vince
was
also
in
contact
at
different
times
during
the
day
with
people
at
the
justice
department
we
were
fully
briefed
and
fully
informed
q
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
president
may
have
spoken
a
chance
that
he
may
have
spoken
with
webb
do
you
know
if
thats
true
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
chance
he
may
have
i
dont
believe
he
did
but
i
think
theres
certainly
a
chance
that
he
may
have
at
some
point
i
dont
believe
he
did
i
think
that
the
last
contact
he
had
during
the
day
yesterday
directly
with
the
justice
department
was
the
am
phone
call
with
the
attorney
general
but
the
white
house
was
fully
informed
on
a
minutetominute
basis
of
what
was
happening
in
waco
and
what
was
happening
at
the
justice
department
q
george
who
decided
that
the
briefing
would
be
done
by
the
attorney
general
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
q
did
you
or
did
the
white
house
communications
staff
were
you
ever
involved
with
that
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
no
we
were
told
about
it
q
did
you
ask
her
to
go
on
nightline
and
macneil
lehrer
and
all
that
stuff
was
that
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
there
was
no
advice
from
the
white
house
at
all
about
her
she
was
on
all
night
all
day
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
and
she
did
a
very
good
job
q
why
did
you
decide
to
have
the
presidents
reaction
to
the
situation
be
only
a
written
statement
which
is
traditionally
the
white
houses
way
of
distancing
the
president
from
the
issue
not
having
him
appear
as
personally
saying
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
well
that
wasnt
the
intent
at
all
as
i
said
we
had
to
we
wanted
to
wait
until
we
had
all
of
the
information
at
hand
the
president
is
also
making
a
statement
today
the
president
made
a
statement
yesterday
morning
the
president
has
been
fully
involved
q
after
this
turned
into
less
than
a
successful
operation
the
only
statement
from
the
president
was
what
was
on
paper
after
the
attorney
general
had
already
given
what
amounted
to
the
major
facts
in
this
mr
stephanopoulos
well
it
was
the
first
statement
from
the
president
not
the
only
statement
from
the
president
number
one
q
after
the
mr
stephanopoulos
number
two
well
the
first
number
two
the
attorney
general
q
he
gave
a
statement
early
in
the
morning
when
the
thing
was
starting
to
move
mr
stephanopoulos
right
and
he
gave
one
yesterday
and
hes
giving
one
today
now
the
second
point
q
it
just
happens
this
was
a
written
statement
with
no
sort
of
communications
policy
or
thought
process
involved
it
was
the
president
wants
to
put
out
a
written
statement
mr
stephanopoulos
knowing
what
we
knew
at
the
time
we
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
the
president
and
he
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
put
out
a
written
statement
expressing
his
regret
and
expressing
his
support
for
the
attorney
generals
q
why
was
it
not
appropriate
for
him
to
personally
do
something
mr
stephanopoulos
well
he
did
personally
do
so
that
is
his
statement
its
a
statement
under
his
name
q
george
yesterday
during
the
briefing
you
didnt
say
the
president
took
full
responsibility
for
what
happened
mr
stephanopoulos
i
certainly
did
q
no
what
you
said
was
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
not
right
susan
q
well
i
think
you
can
go
back
to
the
transcript
i
mean
unless
i
miss
something
mr
stephanopoulos
id
love
to
q
janet
reno
said
that
she
took
full
responsibility
and
you
said
that
she
made
the
decision
that
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
president
takes
responsibility
absolutely
q
took
responsibility
all
right
mr
stephanopoulos
check
the
transcript
q
considering
how
little
was
known
about
what
was
going
on
inside
the
compound
and
even
now
how
little
is
known
why
is
washington
calling
this
a
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
that
knowing
what
we
know
now
and
given
all
of
the
actions
of
david
koresh
before
and
during
it
is
painfully
clear
that
those
there
were
under
his
control
q
its
stretching
it
a
little
bit
where
the
kids
are
concerned
though
isnt
it
george
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
matter
i
mean
i
think
that
david
koresh
must
bear
responsibility
for
the
deaths
of
those
children
absolutely
but
he
clearly
was
intent
on
creating
some
kind
of
an
apocalyptic
incident
and
thats
what
he
did
q
youre
still
operating
completely
on
assumption
right
i
mean
you
have
no
evidence
or
you
know
of
no
evidence
that
this
was
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
we
have
evidence
that
those
inside
the
compound
set
fire
to
the
compound
which
led
to
the
deaths
of
those
inside
q
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
this
might
be
anns
question
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
but
at
what
time
did
clinton
himself
put
out
a
statement
on
this
i
know
dee
dee
said
some
stuff
on
this
at
pm
but
the
president
put
out
mr
stephanopoulos
at
pm
pm
q
right
after
the
evening
news
went
on
the
air
mr
stephanopoulos
no
right
when
we
had
all
the
information
we
were
working
on
it
q
dee
dee
confirmed
this
morning
that
the
investigation
the
president
is
going
to
announce
is
going
to
be
an
administrationrun
investigation
why
not
have
someone
from
the
outside
to
make
sure
that
its
not
colored
by
those
who
would
have
a
political
stake
particularly
those
at
the
atf
whose
actions
have
already
been
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
clearly
the
atf
and
the
justice
department
will
bear
responsibility
for
the
investigation
thats
not
to
rule
out
as
is
often
in
investigations
like
this
having
some
sort
of
independent
involvement
as
well
but
it
will
be
run
by
the
treasury
and
justice
q
are
you
confident
that
you
will
not
have
any
problem
getting
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
q
george
did
the
president
reach
out
to
anybody
else
to
get
advice
after
the
meeting
with
janet
reno
and
who
else
in
the
white
house
sat
in
on
that
meeting
anyone
else
from
justice
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
anybody
else
was
there
at
the
time
it
was
a
phone
call
on
monday
it
wasnt
a
meeting
q
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
sunday
it
was
a
phone
call
it
wasnt
a
meeting
i
believe
he
might
have
been
there
with
bruce
but
beyond
that
i
think
he
just
talked
to
the
attorney
general
q
george
you
said
that
in
that
phone
call
she
said
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
action
as
you
said
that
will
force
him
out
what
did
he
think
she
was
talking
about
if
he
didnt
know
about
tear
gas
what
exactly
was
his
idea
of
what
he
was
approving
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
approving
an
action
to
increase
the
pressure
on
it
didnt
matter
how
she
did
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
i
mean
q
what
information
did
he
have
in
terms
of
how
this
would
proceed
presumably
he
would
have
wanted
to
know
not
minute
byminute
but
in
a
general
sense
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
knew
that
this
was
the
recommendation
of
those
on
the
ground
and
the
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
i
just
dont
know
q
what
is
this
when
you
say
that
this
was
the
recommendation
mr
stephanopoulos
the
action
to
increase
pressure
i
dont
know
exactly
what
he
was
told
whether
he
was
going
to
be
told
that
the
tank
was
going
to
go
up
to
the
left
wall
and
punch
a
hole
in
the
window
or
whether
he
was
just
told
generally
that
they
were
moving
forward
in
a
way
that
would
increase
the
pressure
i
just
dont
know
q
its
hard
to
imagine
him
not
asking
though
q
that
janet
reno
presented
him
with
as
her
best
advice
about
what
they
should
go
forward
with
he
would
have
agreed
mr
stephanopoulos
he
was
he
did
ask
some
general
questions
about
the
advice
and
recommendation
he
gave
at
the
same
time
and
i
would
repeat
that
this
was
based
on
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
q
george
it
would
seem
that
this
question
about
just
exactly
in
what
detail
the
president
was
informed
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
is
going
to
come
up
again
here
and
elsewhere
can
you
take
that
question
and
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
yes
q
get
the
answer
and
come
back
to
us
with
all
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
tell
us
that
there
was
never
a
meeting
a
strategy
session
where
you
and
others
decided
we
will
put
out
a
written
statement
from
the
president
and
we
will
have
janet
reno
be
on
all
of
these
television
broadcasts
mr
stephanopoulos
never
never
q
and
you
never
called
the
justice
department
and
said
to
anyone
or
janet
reno
youre
the
one
who
needs
to
be
out
front
explaining
this
mr
stephanopoulos
not
once
q
it
just
happened
that
way
that
she
was
the
spokesman
that
no
one
ever
saw
bill
sessions
until
mr
stephanopoulos
she
made
a
decision
as
attorney
general
that
it
was
important
for
her
as
the
operational
officer
in
charge
as
the
person
who
made
the
decision
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
on
this
tragic
incident
q
she
had
no
guidance
from
the
white
house
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
didnt
object
q
but
did
you
laughter
no
im
sure
you
didnt
object
but
did
you
suggest
it
was
this
a
plan
mr
stephanopoulos
no
absolutely
not
q
a
strategy
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
clear
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
notify
you
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
knew
about
it
q
what
happened
to
this
great
detailed
process
you
have
for
clearing
and
talking
to
every
public
information
officer
and
every
under
every
rock
and
every
place
in
government
that
something
as
major
as
this
could
have
occurred
without
a
discussion
between
you
and
the
public
information
people
at
least
at
the
justice
department
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
and
the
attorney
general
wanted
to
go
forward
it
seemed
like
a
good
decision
it
was
a
good
decision
she
did
a
good
job
q
let
me
ask
it
this
way
george
if
in
hindsight
how
you
would
handle
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
handled
very
well
q
you
wouldnt
change
a
thing
if
mr
stephanopoulos
change
what
q
the
way
the
white
house
handled
any
part
of
it
from
start
to
finish
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
thats
an
awful
broad
question
and
were
certainly
going
to
have
a
review
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
investigation
is
to
look
for
ways
in
the
future
that
something
like
this
see
what
we
can
learn
from
an
incident
like
this
and
see
what
we
can
learn
about
how
to
handle
them
if
youre
talking
specifically
about
the
issue
of
the
press
conferences
no
there
wouldnt
make
any
change
at
all
q
two
questions
first
of
all
on
her
going
on
tv
no
white
house
people
or
outside
media
consultants
came
up
with
this
idea
its
just
very
reminiscent
of
what
you
guys
did
during
the
campaign
mr
stephanopoulos
how
so
q
im
thinking
of
like
watching
clinton
on
nightline
after
the
draft
story
watching
clinton
on
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
absolutely
no
comparison
yesterday
there
was
a
law
enforcement
incident
the
incident
ended
in
tragic
deaths
of
many
many
people
the
attorney
general
was
involved
in
that
decision
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
to
do
that
she
felt
it
was
her
responsibility
in
the
interest
of
public
information
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
of
the
press
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
questions
were
answered
and
she
did
a
fantastic
job
q
the
second
question
is
did
as
someone
who
knows
clinton
as
well
as
you
do
can
you
understand
why
its
sort
of
hard
to
believe
that
he
might
not
have
asked
some
detailed
questions
about
what
she
intended
to
do
in
other
words
she
came
and
she
said
im
going
to
put
pressure
on
them
its
hard
not
to
see
clinton
whos
fairly
intelligent
and
inquisitive
asking
how
q
what
kind
mr
stephanopoulos
both
the
attorney
general
said
that
he
did
ask
questions
he
did
ask
general
questions
i
dont
have
a
minutebyminute
account
of
the
conversation
q
how
long
a
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
about
minutes
q
telephone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
george
was
the
federal
cost
of
this
standoff
ever
a
consideration
in
terms
of
stepping
up
the
pressure
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
so
no
q
george
you
keep
saying
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
but
then
you
refer
to
it
as
her
decision
does
the
president
not
accept
the
fact
that
as
commanderinchief
it
is
ultimately
his
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
this
has
to
do
with
commanderinchief
this
was
a
law
enforcement
action
not
a
military
action
and
he
clearly
takes
responsibility
for
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
taken
in
his
government
i
mean
i
think
theres
just
no
ambiguity
about
that
q
but
is
he
accepting
it
as
his
decision
as
well
as
hers
or
is
he
saying
its
her
decision
theres
a
difference
mr
stephanopoulos
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
her
decision
he
did
not
object
to
that
decision
he
clearly
takes
full
responsibility
q
george
this
briefing
has
gone
on
just
a
little
over
minutes
and
as
you
can
see
a
lot
of
things
can
be
exchanged
what
exactly
did
they
spend
minutes
talking
about
if
it
was
just
very
general
thats
a
long
period
of
time
in
a
phone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
it
is
an
awful
long
phone
conversation
it
was
a
very
important
phone
conversation
i
think
brit
has
asked
that
we
take
the
question
and
ive
said
that
i
would
q
one
of
the
things
reno
said
last
night
is
that
the
buck
stops
here
i
think
that
was
her
direct
quotation
does
the
president
agree
with
that
in
this
case
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
says
he
accepts
full
responsibility
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
was
saying
is
that
she
made
a
decision
that
shes
going
to
accept
all
the
responsibility
that
comes
to
her
and
shes
not
shrinking
from
that
at
all
but
neither
is
the
president
q
at
any
point
in
the
conversation
last
night
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
or
this
morning
did
she
ever
offer
her
a
resignation
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
q
even
before
the
fire
was
out
yesterday
there
were
some
republicans
on
capitol
hill
calling
for
an
investigation
is
the
white
house
at
all
concerned
about
the
timing
of
those
requests
trying
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
situation
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
i
dont
want
to
cast
any
questions
about
the
motives
of
those
who
are
requesting
investigation
we
want
an
investigation
and
well
have
a
full
and
complete
investigation
q
in
what
forum
will
you
answer
brits
question
will
you
put
out
a
written
statement
will
you
the
wires
how
will
you
answer
the
question
that
youve
taken
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
george
can
you
remind
us
what
the
president
was
doing
all
yesterday
afternoon
where
he
was
and
what
meetings
he
was
involved
in
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
try
and
remember
he
had
a
series
of
meetings
with
different
members
of
the
staff
during
the
afternoon
he
was
certainly
monitoring
the
situation
in
waco
and
getting
periodic
reports
on
that
as
well
he
did
see
some
on
cnn
as
well
i
believe
he
saw
a
fair
amount
of
the
fbi
press
briefing
as
well
q
and
those
reports
would
have
come
to
him
from
mack
mclarty
would
they
do
you
think
mr
stephanopoulos
mack
talked
to
him
bruce
talked
to
him
i
talked
to
him
q
george
to
follow
helens
question
in
their
conversation
this
morning
did
they
discuss
at
all
her
statement
last
night
in
response
to
the
question
about
whether
she
would
resign
did
he
say
i
dont
know
why
you
felt
the
need
to
say
that
im
here
to
reassure
you
that
you
dont
have
to
do
this
did
that
come
up
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
even
came
up
that
specifically
i
know
that
the
bulk
of
the
conversation
was
discussing
where
do
we
go
from
here
and
what
form
the
investigation
q
the
didnt
talk
at
all
about
her
kind
of
remarkable
comment
last
night
about
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
believe
she
was
asked
a
question
q
and
her
response
was
if
the
president
wants
me
to
i
will
mr
stephanopoulos
which
would
be
i
think
the
standard
response
that
most
cabinet
members
would
give
i
mean
its
a
conditional
statement
q
have
a
need
to
talk
about
whether
personally
about
whether
the
president
wanted
her
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
they
talked
about
it
i
mean
what
i
learned
about
the
conversation
was
that
it
was
largely
about
the
investigation
itself
and
this
just
didnt
come
up
i
did
not
ask
the
question
if
they
talked
about
q
will
you
take
that
with
the
brit
package
mr
stephanopoulos
certainly
laughter
q
george
for
the
record
does
the
president
want
her
to
resign
i
know
dee
dee
answered
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
not
he
supports
janet
reno
shes
a
good
attorney
general
shes
done
a
good
job
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
extremely
well
q
george
does
the
president
feel
that
he
and
janet
reno
were
let
down
by
the
unanimous
professional
advice
from
the
law
enforcement
experts
on
the
ground
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
the
president
is
not
secondguessing
that
decision
and
those
recommendations
in
any
way
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
doesnt
regret
the
loss
of
life
everybody
regrets
the
loss
of
life
in
this
situation
but
the
best
judgments
were
made
in
a
difficult
situation
based
on
the
best
information
we
had
q
george
the
conversation
was
the
one
on
sunday
is
that
correct
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
how
long
was
the
one
at
am
yesterday
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
ill
take
that
question
too
q
were
these
outside
experts
that
they
were
consulting
with
or
experts
within
the
atf
and
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
youd
have
to
ask
them
im
just
not
sure
i
know
that
there
were
several
experts
q
and
also
why
werent
there
replacements
for
these
people
is
the
unit
that
small
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
think
it
is
a
very
small
highlyspecialized
unit
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
investigation
will
examine
q
george
isnt
there
a
factor
here
involving
the
fbi
director
normally
a
president
when
he
wants
to
get
information
doesnt
only
asks
the
attorney
general
i
know
the
chain
of
command
but
presidents
talk
to
their
fbi
directors
in
this
case
throughout
this
entire
siege
he
has
not
felt
that
he
could
pick
up
the
phone
and
talk
to
bill
sessions
who
is
from
waco
and
get
expertise
from
him
on
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
talked
to
the
fbi
director
well
in
the
beginning
of
the
situation
when
it
first
broke
out
in
waco
at
the
same
time
the
attorney
general
bears
the
ultimate
responsibility
and
he
was
getting
fully
briefed
from
the
attorney
general
q
dont
you
think
the
ambiguous
situation
that
director
sessions
is
in
has
some
impact
on
the
way
the
president
is
briefed
and
on
the
way
that
all
of
this
evolved
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
its
perfectly
appropriate
that
he
be
briefed
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
the
attorney
general
has
supervisory
authority
over
the
fbi
director
and
thats
following
the
chain
of
command

press

demonstrably
false
take
a
look

britain
sometime

on
drug
criminalization
the
evidence
there
shows
that
during
periods
of
time
when
drugs
such
as
heroin
were
illegal
crime
went
up
and
people
did
die
from
bad
drugs

dodge

to

if
youd
done
any

youd
realize
that
there
is
plenty
of
reason
to
believe
that
legalizing
drugs
will
have
many

there
are
some

arguments

they

the

are
in
general
fighting
any

there
is
also
worry
that
a
vat
would
be
far
too
easy
to
increase
incrementally
i
was
a
graduate
student
in
the
early
and
we
had
a
conference
on
reaganomics
where
jerry
jordan
then
a
member
of
the
council
of
economic
advisors
was
a
speaker
i
had
the
pleasure
of
driving
him
back
to
the
airport
afterwards
and
since
taxes
were
the
main
topic
of
discussion
i
thought
i
would
ask
him
about
the
vat
i
have
favored
it
for
these
reasons
you
mention
that
the
income
base
is
too
hazy
to
define
that
it
taxes
savings
and
investment
that
it
is
likely
to
be
more
visible
he
agreed
and
reported
that
the
cea
at
that
time
was
in
favor
of
vat
so
why
not
propose
it
i
asked
he
replied
that
the
reagan
white
house
feared
that
the
democrats
would
introduce
vat
in
addition
to
the
income
tax
rather
than
in
lieu
better
not
to
give
them
any
ideas
he
said
pretty
prescient
btw
what
is
different
between
canadas
tax
and
most
of
europes
that
makes
it
visible
yes
any

tell

good

i
want
to
say
first
how
delighted
i
am
to
be
here
with
secretary
riley
and
with
senator
graham
the
three
of
us
served
as
governors
together
during
the
when
we
worked
constantly
on
strategies
to
improve
our
schools
when
we
led
often
difficult
and
long
efforts
to
upgrade
the
standards
in
american
education
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
instruction
our
children
were
receiving
there
were
no
two
governors
whom
i
admired
more
during
that
period
than
the
two
who
now
stand
on
this
stage
with
the
teacher
of
the
year
and
i
think
both
of
them
would
join
me
in
saying
that
after
all
the
testimony
has
been
heard
and
all
the
bills
have
been
passed
and
the
funds
have
been
raised
and
allocated
it
all
comes
down
to
what
happens
between
the
teacher
and
the
students
in
the
classroom
thats
why
todays
ceremony
honoring
the

of

ive
been
reading
your

im
convinced

you
will
back
anything
no

how
damaging
it
may
be
to
yours
or
anyone
elses
rights
if
you
think
it
will
hurt
people
you
dont
like
its
people
with
that
attitude
that
set
up
the
preconditions
for
the
holocaust
a
process
that
is
in
place
now
in
this
country
even
if
the
tattered
pitiful
remains
of
the
constitution
is
slowing
its
progress
this
isnt
a
libertarian
issue
others
may
argue
that
line
but
from
a
strictly
constitutional
view
of
a
democratic
govt
what
the
fbi
and
batf
did
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
even
if
their
reasons
for
trying
to
arrest
koresh
were
right
anything
that
leads
to
the
deaths
of
children
if
nothing
else
touches
your
stoney
heart
is
wrong
no
matter
who
pushed
the
button
for
gods
sake
man
get
your
morality
back
the
person
who
murdered
children
was
koresh
he
kept
them
there
and
brought
about
their
deaths
deliberately
you
may
consider
that
i
am
a
complete
bastard
and
a
not
very
nice
chap
thats
quite
true
i
dont
pretend
to
be
being
nice
is
what
amateurs
try
to
do
if
you
want
to
talk
politics
you
are
talking
hard
decisions
such
as
whether
the
lives
of
the
troops
should
be
risked
attempting
to
rescue
the
children
anyone
who
has
held
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
since
fdr
has
held
the
threat
that
if
the
usa
or
its
allies
were
to
be
threatened
then
the
usa
would
risk
nuclear
holocaust
in
order
to
protect
freedom
beleive
it
or
not
that
is
not
the
sort
of

that
nice
chaps
make
do
they
have
a

nutters
section
of
the

version
of
cnd
by
any
chance
there
are
cases
where
society
has
to
be
protected
from
madmen
such
as
koresh
or
hitler
if
it
were
not
for
the
consideration
of
the
children
in
there
the
question
of
the
tactics
to
be
used
would
not
be
a
matter
of
anything
but
academic
significance
it
is
not
for
the
govt
to
prevent
people
from
commiting
mass
suicide
the
latest
reports
are
that
cult
members
were
shot
attempting
to
leave
the
compound
by
koresh
loyalists
during
the
fire
if
proven
that
would
entail
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
of
those
who
want
to
promote
koresh
as
some
sort
of
role
model
or
hero
i
need
hardly
add
that
it
is
koresh
that
has
created
the
holocaust
in
this
case
by
the
deliberate
arson
of
the
ranch
appocalypse
let
me
see
if
i
got
this
right
group

schismatics
erect
a

and
after
at

fifty
years
of
peaceful
coexistance
with
the
outside
community
having
shoot

only
with
each
other
this
makes

are

to
be

with
the

as

in

its
the

are

if

demands

president

discussed
the
desirability
of
reviewing
and
updating
us
laws
and
regulations
to
reflect
the
end
of
the
cold
war
congress
has
already
acted
to
revise
many
laws
to
reflect
the
fact
that
a
communist
soviet
union
has
been
replaced
by
a
democratic
russia
and
other
independent
states
however
many
laws
and
regulations
remain
that
contain
language
and
restrictions
that
fail
to
reflect
the
end
of
the
cold
war
and
that
unnecessarily
undermine
relations
with
russia
and
the
other
new
independent
states
the
president
today
has
ordered
an
executive
review
of
laws
and
regulations
so
that
where
appropriate
and
consistent
with
us
security
and
other
national
interests
such
provisions
can
be
revised
or
removed
he
has
asked
ambassadoratlarge
strobe
talbott
to
coordinate
this
review
on
an
expedited
basis
the
president
has
indicated
that
he
will
welcome
congressional
efforts
to
help
this
review
proceed
as
quickly
as
possible
this
review
will
weigh
all
considerations
that
pertain
to
revision
of
such
provisions
and
the
initiation
of
the
review
may
help
to
remedy
some
of
the
circumstances
that
have
justified
such
provisions
in
the
past
for
example
because
the
russians
are
eager
to
have
their
status
changed
under
the
jacksonvanik
legislation
president
yeltsin
personally
assured
president
clinton
in
vancouver
that
he
would
look
into
individual
cases
involving
continuing
restrictions
on
emigration
from
russia
by
addressing
such
issues
this
review
can
help
strengthen
the
bonds
of
trust
and
partnership
between
the
us
and

and
between
the

and

libertarians
realize
what
this

does
to

so
just
as
a

of

would

a

of
noncoercers
would
not

for
the

the

would

is
educating
the

to
become

well
thats
the
obvious
conclusion
given

the

is
that

todays

next

had
been

which
doesnt
sound

the

action
i
would
expect
from
a

our
government
lies
as
it
tries
to
cover
over
its
incompetence
and
negligence
why
should
i
believe
the
fbis
claims
about
anything
else
when
we
can

that
they
are
lying
this
system
of

is

you
dont

such
diabolical

on

yet
you
are
willing

on

do
i

a

garison
what
do
you
mean
if
adults
want
to
get
together
for
sodomy
in
private
thats
their
business
and
thats
precisely
what
they
do
so
whats
your
problem
with
the

boyo
the
only
difference

us
is
what
we

we
love
bi
andrew
d

do
it
in

and
it
wont
be
a
problem
but
the
reason
that
the
homosexual
activists
are
so
hot
on
antidiscrimination
laws
is
that
they
want
to
be
able
to
wear
that
lovely
chiffon

gown
to
work
and
not
have
people
get
disgusted
to
be
able
to
wear
their

and
not
worry
about
getting
fired
to
be
able
to
have
access
to
young
boys
so
that
they
start
making
the
next
generation
of
homosexuals
if
your
right

privacy
is
what
makes

unconstitutional
a

i

paul
you
have
handled

so
well
i
think
that
you
could
write

thank
you
id
hoped
to
avoid
the
rancor
that
has
characterized
much
of
the
debate
on
this
issue
im
also
not
going
to
prolong
the
debate
on
this
i
wanted
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
you
make
but
this
will
be
my
last
posting
on
this
no
dont
stop
right
to
equal
opportunity
lets
call
it
reo
involves
coercion
in
all
cases
by
definition
one
question
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
reo
or
just
that
this
is
a
lesser
right
to
foa
good
question
it
just
depends
hows
that
for
an
answer
seriously
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
wether
or
not
you
are
talking
about
a
governmental
employer
or
not
in
this
case
i
believe
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
discrimination
direct
or
indirect
period
i
feel
this
way
not
because
it
would
offend
my
moral
sensibilities
which
it
of
course
would
but
because
the
government
is
a
coercive
entity
which
we
cannot
escape
it
boggles
my
mind
that
in
my
lifetime
there
were
whites
only
drinking
fountains
in
some
parks
but
no
fountains
for
others
yet
the
taxes
garnished
to
support
those
fountains
certainly
were
not
applied
to
whites
only
in
essence
we
cannot
escape
the
coercive
state
even
randy
weavers
have
to
pay
property
tax
on
the
other
hand
private
employers
are
not
a
monopoly
and
their
businesses
should
be
run
by
them
and
not
by
the
government
unless
they
elect
to
turn
their
affairs
over
to
that
government
why
says
who
why
can
mom
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forced
and
force
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
in
the
case
of
the
mom
pop
store
their
foa
is
directly
affected
they
as
individuals
will
have
to
associate
with
whomever
they
hire
in
the
case
of
ibm
i
ask
again
whose
foa
are
we
protecting
i
do
not
accept
that
ibm
as
a
corporate
entity
has
a
right
to
foa
but
if
the
mom
pop
store
is
affected
by
who
they
hire
isnt
ibm
there
is
a
slippery
slope
here
in
santa
cruz
where
a
number
of
loony
antidiscrimination
laws
exist
a
guy
sued
a
restaurant
for
not
hiring
him
because
he
had
every
imaginable
kitchen
utensil
dangling
from
his
earlobe
and
his
tatoos
were
very
distracting
suddenly
by
arm
waving
by
magic
a
landlord
does
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basis
does
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seems
that
vague
terms
like
no
contact
with
tenants
suffice
on
the
basis
that
the
landlord
has
no
contact
with
hisher
tenants
if
the
landlord
doesnt
associate
with
his
tenants
then
how
can
he
complain
that
his
foa
is
being
violated
i
have
a
lot
of
interaction
all
positive
with
my
tenants
so
i
guess
that
that
isnt
an
issue
but
say
i
were
to
buy
a
unit
in
another
town
and
have
it
managed
by
a
third
party
lets
say
that
i
have
a
real
aversion
to
christians
because
of
the
stuff
that
they
buy
into
hook
line
and
sinker
and
because
of
the
lunatic
schmucks
that
they
try
to
get
elected
i
dont
want
any
of
those
fish
symbols
hanging
in
the
window
of
a
house
that
i
own
should
the
government
intervene
if
i
was
elie
weizel
and
the
only
rental
applicant
was
tom
metzger
should
i
be
forced
to
rent
this
distant
unit
to
him
the
companies
on
the

for
example
are
all
privately
owned
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
their
owners
they
have
no
anonymous
unknown
to
them
owners
publicly
owned
in
the
sense
that
their
stock
is
publicly
traded
and
that
the
shares
of
stock
are
owned
by
a
generic
and
everchanging
public
yes
and
the
neat
thing
about
this
is
that
unlike
the
mom
pop
store
you
and
i
can
buy
shares
in

and
have

over

thats

dont

he

the

and
everyone
else
in
the
compound
no

what
the

did
the
situation
in

was
similar
to
a
hostage
situation
with
a
madman
holding
a
gun
against
the
head
of
an
innocent
person
in
such
a
situation
a
person
who
provokes
the

causes
him
to
pull
the

trigger
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
the

janet

blindly
stumbled
in
there
and
basically
threw
a
tear
gas
container
at
the
madman
hoping
that
he
would
release
the

its
no
surprise
that
the
madman
would
pull
the
trigger
in
response
to
that
kind
of
provocation
such
a
hostage
situation
has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back

since
that

thanks
to
kim
for
following
up
i
was
hoping
that
someone
would
bring
up
the
issue
of
cost
compensation
the
problem
with
the
argument
is
that
it
fails
to
explain
why
kidney
dialysis
rd
services
have
expanded
massively
in
the
last
decade
after
all
no
one
is
forcing
private
providers
to
offer
this
service
if
they
are
losing
money
on
the
treatment
which
according
to
information
ive
collected
from
several
providers
they
are
not
why
would
they
not
simply
limit
their
losses
by
cutting
back
on
services
engage
in
effective
rationing
of
supply
rather
than
expand
the
coverage
to
a
larger
market
that
must
then
be
compensated
by
raising
prices
in
other
areas
perhaps
there
is
a
competitive
advantage
in
there
after
all
would
not
reputable
and
dedicated
physicians
prefer
to
affiliate
with
an
institution
that
offers
dialysis
services
would
they
not
therefore
tend
to
admit
patients
in
greater
numbers
to
an
institution
that
offered
a
full
range
of
diagnostic
and
treatment
options
undoubtedly
in
fact
it
is
the
fact
that
hospitals
frequently
compete
for
physicians
rather
than
for
patients
that
in
part
complicates
and
undermines
a
simplistic
freemarket
analysis
of
the
market
for
medical
care
hospitals
tend
to
lose
money
on
all
sorts
of
hightech
highprice
machinery
they
manage
to
make
it
up
on
other
charges
once
again
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
is
true
in
regard
to
kidney
dialysis
although
price
controls
have
promoted
an
expansion
of
services
to
a
much
greater
volume
of
patients
rd
is
still
a
profitable
service
otherwise
one
would
expect
to
see
evidence
of
rationing
rather
than
the
vast
expansion
that
has
occurred
remember
the
notion
that
you
can
lose
a
little
on
each
treatment
but
make
it
up
in
volume
is
not
good
economics
even
in
a
free
market
then
how
do
you
explain
why
grocery
stores
routinely
offer
an
array
of
products
at
prices
below
cost
are
not
grocery
stores
embedded
in
a
relatively
free
market
can
you
spell
loss
leader
i
knew
you
could
grocery
stores
do
not
attempt
to
make
up
the
loss
on
an
individual
product
by
selling
more
of
it
in
fact
your
argument
above
is
that
kidney
dialysis
is
a
loss
leader
for
other
medical
treatments
where
lost
revenue
can
be
regained
but
the
evidence
does
not
support
this
contention
rather
it
appears
that
price
controls
have
disciplined
the
market
by
forcing
an
expansion
of
service
and
development
of
improved
lowercost
technology
to
provide
comparable
benefits
providers
continue
to
profit
from
rd
they
simply
make
less
on
each
treatment
than
they
would
have
if
the
price
had
risen
at
the
rate
that
uncontrolled
treatments
have
there
is
no
question
that
had
price
controls
forced
the
price
of
rd
substantially
below
its
actual
cost
that
some
or
all
of
the
doomsday
predictions
of
freemarket
advocates
would
have
been
seen
restriction
of
service
lagging
technological
development
etc
likewise
it
appears
that
in
the
va
and
armed
forces
medical
care
systems
where
providers
are
government
agencies
some
of
these
negative
impacts
may
occur
rd
patients
in
the
va
system
in
spokane
for
example
must
travel
to
seattle
miles
away
for
treatment
the
bottom
line
however
is
that
this
is
an
example
of
government
intervention
of
a
rather
extreme
sort
that
appears
to
have
had
beneficial
results
for
both
providers
and
consumers
claims
that
government
bureaucracy
inevitably
leads

outcomes

interests
since
the

do
you
honestly
expect

to
believe
that
theyd
go
to
all
the
trouble
to
subvert

and
yet
would
still
promptly
slink
back

of

who
knew
enough
to
invoke

combination
of
magic
spells
and
mystic
mumbojumbo
not

that

why
do
you
even
care
what

didnt
you

something
that

about
this
whole

could
someone
please
calmly
explain
why
homosexuality
is
such
a
great
sin
without
giving
the
standard
just
because
god
sez
so
almost
all
of
judeo
thanks
for
your
posting
i
enjoyed
it
the
reason
homosexuality
is
a
sin
is
because
the
jews
were
a
struggling
group
of
people
trying
hard
to
survive
and
differentiate
between
themselves
and
their
oppressors
this
led
to
several
things
worshipping
one
god
all
their
foes
were
polytheistic
all
sex
was
put
in
to
a
moral
context
all
their
foes
were
perverts
and
spilled
their
seed
liberally
its
just
as
easy
to
spill
seed
or
spread
it
thin
heterosexualy
why
then
the
specific
prohibition
on
homosexuals
especially
since
the
answer
to
everything
back
then
was
stoning
to
death
doesnt
help
population
growth
much
also
to
just
say
that
their
foes
were
perverts
begs
the
question
the
key
word
is
spilled
if
semen
was
spilled
anywhere
where
there
was
a
chance
of
procreation
it
was
ok
if
it
was
spilt
on
the
ground
or
in
to
a
man
it
was
a
big
sin
ditto
with
animals
the
jews
said
sexpro
creation
homosexuals
didnt
breed
there
fore
they
are
evil
and
should
be
stoned
to
death
all
sex
was
directed
towards
breeding
the
jews
were
few
in
number
and
their
foes
many
to
survive
everything
had
to
go
into
multiplication
like
i
said
stoning
to
death
doesnt
help
population
much
it
sounds
more
like
a
set
of
prejudices
that
already
existed
and
were
blown
into
a
religion
to
emphasize
the
differences
of
jewish
culture
and
enshrine
some
pretty
stoning
nonbreeding
population
was
fine
only
the
breeders
were
considered
to
be
worth

clayton

the

have
gotten
a
law
passed
in

that
makes
it
illegal
to
discriminate
against
a
person
in
employment
based
on
their
sexual
orientation
and
not
defined
sexual
orientation
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
got
him
cramer
is
now
claiming
that
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
rather
than
a
chronicly
homosexual
condition
this
changes
the
whole
argument
in
as
much
that
is
pedophilia
is
a
sexual
orientation
all
of
its
own
peds
cannot
be
called
homosexual
peds
are
peds
who
may
have
a
preference
as
to
the
sex
of
the
child
they
molest
though
most
do
not
have
a
preference
but
that
is
a
subset
of
their
basic
ped
nature
cramer
has
as
much
as
admitted
that
peds
and
gay
men
are
different
orientations
all
we
need
now
is
to
get
him
to
admit
that
the
apparent
similarities
he
keeps
on
about
are
just
optical
illusions

press
release
from
the
california
department
of
insurance
california
insurance
commissioner
endorses
federal
legislation
to
protect
consumers
from
scam
insurance
companies
i
may
be
a
little
dense
but
i
would
have
thought
that
protecting
consumers
from
scam
insurance
companies
would
be
the
prime
objective
of
something
called
the
cal
insurance
commission
if
they
arent
accomplishing
that
now
then
why
do
we
need
them
very
simple
an
insurance
commissioner
is
a
bureaucrat
a
regulator
it
is
hisher
duties
to
make
rules
to
enforce
laws
heshe
cannot
make
laws
if
there
is
no
law
that
covers
a
specific
subject
say
scam
insurance
companies
a
regulator
cannot
create
one
so
they
have
to
go
to
a
proper
legislative
body
to
get
such
a
law
enacted
for
the
california
insurance
commissioner
there
are
two
possible
legislative
bodies
the
california
state
legislature
and
the
us
congress
we
all
know
how
little
the
california
state
legislature
accomplishes
esp
along
the
lines
of
insurance
reform
legislation
negative
movement
so
garamendi
wants
the
feds
to
do
it
because
a
he
has
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
federal
law
through
and
b
since
many
of
the
scam
companies
work
across
state
linesnational
borders
it
is
better
to
have
a
law
that
reach
out
into
other
jurisdictions

dale

said
a
real
world
data
point
a
person
has
a
much
stronger
legal
claim
for
harrassment
sexual
or
otherwise
if
they
make
it
clear
to
the
offender
that
their
behaviour
is
unwanted
if
the
behaviour
persists
harrassment
is
much
easier
to
demonstrate
due
to
the
fact
that
the
offender
knew
that
the
behaviour
was
unwanted
no
argument
here
my
original
query
regarded
the
question
of
why
the
first
sexual
proposition
made
by
person
a
to
person
b
would
be
considered
to
be
sexual
harassment
by
somemany
people
assuming
of
course
that
there
does
not
exist
a
power
relationship
between
a
and
b
such
that
the
proposition
carries
strong
implications
of
extortion
right
from
word
one
i
can
only
say
that
those
people
are
wrong
the
word
harass
means
to
irritate
or
torment
persistently
id
hardly
consider
one
time
to
fall
under
the
definition
of
persistent
additionally
there
is
no
basis
to
assume
the
behaviour
is
unwanted
unlike
an
illegal
proposition
of
course
i
think
the
original
question
of
offering
money
for
sex
is
inarguably
harrassment
because
the
activity
is
illegal
and
could
be
presumed
to
be
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
i
have
to
take
issue
with
this
viewpoint
given
that
a
prostitution
is
a
victimless
crime
and
b
there
are
literally
millions
of
americans
who
participate
in
some
sort
of
victimless
activities
which
the
state
has
defined
to
be
criminal
eg
prostitution
obscenity
gambling
using
certain
recreational
drugs
having
nonmercenary
sex
with
persons
not
ones
spouse
in
certain
states
having
unnatural
sex
with
people
regardless
of
marital
status
or
exchange
of
money
in
certain
states
etc
id
have
to
say
that
the
idea
that
an
activity
may
be
presumed
to
be
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
merely
because
it
is
illegal
is
the
sort
of
sophistry
that
only
a
judge
could
indulge
in
with
a
straight
face
he
said
speaking
as
a
law
student
whos
read
his
share
of
judicial
opinions
in
which
reality
was
not
only
denied
but
in
fact
actually
inverted
in
order
to
make
the
universe
conform
to
the
writers
politics
i
was
speaking
from
a
legalistic
viewpoint
what
you
say
is
true
but
the
law
in
order
to
make
what
little
sense
it
manages
to
make
has
to
make
some
assumptions
assuming
that
an
illegal
activity
is
unwanted
by
the
average
citizen
i
think
is
reasonable
certainly
i
would
need
a
preponderance
of
evidence
on
the
side
of
the
propositioner
that
there
was
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
proposition
was
welcome
the
number
of
people
who
participate
in
victimless
crimes
notwithstanding
the
fact
reamins
that
under
the
law
the
activity
is
illegal
to
presume
that
the
proposition
is
welcome
simply
because
a
large
number
of
people
indulge
in
it
is
the
type
of
sophistry
only
a

could
indulge

it

and

prefer

cold

until
you
win
then
nurse

back

for
another
go
around
enemy
sounds
like
thats
the
viewpoint
of
the
stereotypical
rednecked
conservative
always
been
commies
always
will
be
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
oh
btw
germany
has
sure
come
back
as
a
terrible
enemy
after
wwii
hasnt
it
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
cannot
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
cannot
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong

someone
else
will
champion

or

that
is
why
we
have

not

instead
of

on

we

to
decide
stupid
this
is
just

those
who
want

impose

just
the

thing
i
thought

were
against
actually
my

pretty
libertarian

this

issue

this

why
it

hence
men
who

sorry

you
are
responding
to
someone
wellrecognized
as
a
flaming
nut
ie
clayton
cramer
he
must
have
been
abused
by
a
man
and
is
living
his
life
in
an
attempt
to
vilify
all
men
who
like
sex
with
other
men
something
slightly
similar
to
the
way
his
assailant
liked
it
with
him
he
will
alter
or
misrepresent
anything
he
finds
to
try
to
prove
that
there
are
homosexuals
who
wish
to
rape
little
boys
like
he
was
coming
out
of
the
woodwork
there
is
no
hope
for
him
in
all
probability
he
is
secretly
gay
which
compounds
his
neurosis
in
his
own
mind
by
thinking
that
someone
else
made
him
that
way
i
dont
personally
see
how
someone
like
him
could
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the
same
time
as
mentally
crippled
and
dominated
as
he
is
by
his
fantasies
he
would
have
you
believe

the
figures
on
the
percentage
of
people
who
like
to
do
it
with
the
same
sex
sometime
or
all
the
time
is
way
smaller
than
it
is
but
then
he
will
virtually
assert
that
everyones
queer

theyre
trying

get

he
actually
believes
despite
all
evidence
that
homosexuals
do
some
huge
disproportionate
amount
of
child
sexual
abuse
even
though
he
insists
that
there
may
be
as
few
as
of
them
in
the
male
population
if
there
were
that
few
of
them
in
the

san

be
empty
because
a
significant
portion
of

sought
a
tolerant

in

the
numbers
simply
do
not

when
you
add

i
thought
i
was

homosexuals
support
laws

against
the

of

are
attempting

ok
ill
leave
others
to

your

but
i
think
im
able
to
discuss
liberterian
ideas
the
ideas
are
good
they
seek
to
maximise
individual
rights
by
keeping
governments
out
of
transactions
between
consenting
adults
if
an
employer
wants
to
discriminate
against
a
group
shehe
should
be
allowed
to
to
maximise
their
freedom
the
discriminatees
can
go
elsewhere
unfortunately
it
doesnt
relate
to
maximising
total
individual
rights
within
a
community
if
an
employer
or
shopkeeper
or
whatever
can
discriminate
in
this
way
then
the
freedom
of
the
discriminatee
goes
down
because
people
do
not
live
in
perfect
economic
conditions
with
perfect
mobility
unlimited
numbers
of
potential
employers
of
their
skills
unlimited
places
to
buy
goods
the
liberterian
argument
leads
to
a
decrease
in
the
amount
of
liberty
in
the
community
you
mean
if
a
large
part
of
the
population
supports
discrimination
against
homosexuals
they
will
be
injured
but
if
a
large

slave
labor
was

to

well
into

century
and
of

in

slave

of

in

ways
this
treatment
of

most
horrifying
aspect
of

second

eventually
it

the

you

they

similar

they

never

southerners
who
sought

divert

from
the
institution
as
the
central
issue
of
the
civil

in
fact
however
the
argument
is
specious
at
best
more
recent
scholarship
from
the
last
years
demonstrates
rather
conclusively
that
the
cottonsugar
tobacco
economy
and
its
reliance
on
slavery
was
increasingly
dominant
in
the
south
prior
to
the
civil

this
is
because
the
south
did
not
receive
the
massive
momentum
of
capital
intensive
growth
that
the
northern
states
did
compare
the
northern
agricultural
system
with
the
southern
and
you
will
see
a
major
difference
in

capital

in

the

used

in

that
is
not
the
argument
that
i
have
heard
it
would

because
the
growth
in
the
north
would
not
have
been
sustained
for
much
longer
without
spilling
over
to
the
southern
states
ie
northern
industry
would
have
migrated
capital

the

and
with
that
would
have
come
immigrant
labor
to
the
ports
of
the
south
eg
charleston
savannah
mobile
new
orleans
etc
this
would
have
put
the
breaks
on
the
slave
market
and
slavery
would
have
been
outmoded
by
the
capital
intensity
of
competing
agriculturalists
those
that

what
are

they
accused

i
believe
it
is
a
general

that
is
no

i
dont
think
that
this
is
accurate
i
believe
and
could
be
wrong
that
there
is
a
specific
right
allegedly
to
have
been
violated
like
the

or
whatever
what
about

has
there
been
any
concern
that
a
verdict
against
koon
et
al
might
be
overturned
upon

because
theyre
being
tried
again
for
the
same
actions
i
thought
i
heard
something
on
the
news
about
this
the
ss
has
previously
ruled
that
since
the
seperate
governments
were
in
essence
seperate
sovereigns
then
double
jeopardy
does
not
apply
if
this
is
true
then
could
defendents
also
be
tried
under
city
and
county
governments
this
mornings
paper
said
that
the
aclu
has
decided
to
reinstate
its
opposition
to
this
kind
of
thing
they
had
earlier
suspended
their
opposition
while
they
examined
the
king
case
there
might
be
hope
for
the
aclu
after
all
double
jeopardy
does
not
apply
but
not
for
the
reasons
you
quote
double
jeopardy
states
that
a
person
may
not
be
tried
twice
on
the
same
charge
however
the
police
are
not
on
trial
for
the
crime
of
excessive
force
or
assault
they
are
now
on
trial
for
the
different
crime
of
violating
mr
kings
civil
rights
as
for
the
city
and
county
or
state
trying
you
more
than
once
it
most
likely
will
not
happen
this
is
because
cities
and
states
have
separate
laws
governing
behaviour
for
example
in
some
states
it
is
an
offence
to
carry
marijuana
but
not
a
city
offence
also
i
think
murder
is
against
federal
but
not
some
state
laws
and
my
mind
was
filled
with
wonder
when
the

what

there

kill

this

youre
being

generous
to

i
think
in
practice
communism
has
solved
the
problem
by
killing
off
anybody
who
is
too
productive

who
therefore
raises
embarrassing
questions
about
why
the

the

butchery

a
poor

best
is
to

to
which
people

flee

wonder
just
what

been
forced
to

would
they
have
revolted

best
of

is
to

locking

it

so
heavily
with

barbed

that
most

fleeing

it
die
and
then
give
everyone
the
choice
of

prison

this
would
be
a
bad

novel
if
the

the

crossing

i

we
are

congresswoman

we

were

the
point
ladies

michael
is
not
entirely
correct
in
his
theory
that
because
members
of
our
race
and
gender
made
great
advances
the
race
and
gender
as
a
whole
deserve
more
respect
than
they
receive
white

do
deserve
to
be
treated
better
than
they
are
being
treated
but
not
for
that
reason
and
the
malebashers
he
quoted
are
repugnant
hatemongers
no
better
than
the

they
despise
so
no
ones
right
as

white

need

yes
but
everyone
else
needs
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
being

right
back
is
disgusting
racist
and
sexist
why
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyone
fairly
without
generalizing
what
stupidity
gene
makes
this
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
missing
in
this
whole
discourse
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
words
it
is
the
l
word
loser
thats
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
this
argument
it
is
all
about
winning
and
losing
and
nothing
else
let
me
explain
remember
the
eighties
no
excuses
nobody
who
can
handle
a
mail
buffer
can
claim
they
are
too
young
to
remember
ronald
reagan
yet
the
eighties
were
about
how
america
learned
to
win
once
again
then
wouldnt
you
know
we
won
so
well
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
win
no
cold
war
to
endure
no
nuclear
holocaust
no
more
worlds
to
conquer
we
forgot
about
outer
space
long
ago
the
kind
of
overwhelming
no
holds
barred
success
that
killed
alexander
the
great
yes
there
were
a
few
little
problems
along
the
way
stock
market
meltdown
here
an
sl
bailout
there
a
few
revolts
and
crazy
middle
eastern
dictators
to
contend
with
but
as
tacitus
would
tell
ya
the
god
augustus
never
had
it
so
good
in
the
meantime
there
is
guilt
for
winning
maybe
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserve
ones
bounty
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
days
bill
clinton
affirmative
action
and
lots
of
discourse
about
people
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
us
in
the
winning
business
this
kind
of
talk
is
mildly
irritating
but
there
is
still
no
suggestion
of
losing
but
what
do
we
find
now
to
put
it
mildy
the
stereotype
of
our
white
male
nonwinner
is
woody
hayes
in
the
rose
bowl
punching
out
photojournalists
when
those
california
fruits
and
nuts
steal
another
one
with
a
hail
mary
pass
in
the
fourth
quarter
the
whole
idea
behind
three
yards
and
a
cloud
of
dust
is
to
wear
your
opponent
down
until
he
collapses
in
the
final
period
but
woody
just
used
his
fists
uzzies
seem
to
be
the
weapon
of
choice
these
days
who
is
dfens
anyway
the
answer
is
as
plain
as
the
horn
rims
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
douglas
posing
as
a
loser
this
is
known
as
controversial
casting
but
that
baggy
shortsleeved
white
shirt
sure
does
look
natural
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woody
always
dressed
that
way
did
we
really
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrobe
without
putting
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
starting
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bashing
dfens
is
the
same
game
as
bashing
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
used
to
blow
away
all
the
time
as
that
archwasp
male
gender
george
c
scott
declaimed
americans
traditionally
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
tolerate
a
loser
and
so
on
the
political
implications
are
simple
if
as
many
socialists
and
democrats
do
you
consider
society
a
finite
pie
to
a
apportioned
in
some
equitable
way
then
you
have
to
worry
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
women
today
asian
homosexuals
tommorrow
and
yes
indeed
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determined
day
when
the
balance
of
the
pie
has
finally
swung
against
that
minority
or
you
can
just
blow
the
whole
thing
off
and
say
as
do
most
conservatives
and
all
the
libertarians
and
act
is
if
you
didnt
care
whos
winning
and
whos
losing
in
some
cases
you
might
say
something
about
make
sure
the
game
is
fair
equality
of
opportunity
not
of
condition
in
the
latter
case
you
might
be
able
to
identify
yourself
as
a
neoconservative
or
a
neoliberal
depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
limit
the
pot
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduate
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunions
but
it
beats
being
a
nerd
as
i
would
imagine
michael
douglas
would
now
agree
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
only
way
to
go
even
in
hollywood
which
treats
losers
worse
than
any
other
place
in
america
except
for
new
york
and
washington
dc
and
even
in
columbus
ohio
which
produced
alex
keaton
but
no
champion
football
teams
in

and

id
like
to
see
more
winners
in
this
society
regardless
of
race
gender
religious
preference
and
sexual
orientation
maybe
we
should
even
let

once
pointed

that
curious
fact
well
since
tax
evasion
is
illegal
one
generally
would
not
bother
to
consider
whether
it
was
unpatriotic
or
not
how
often
does
one
think
of
murder
as
being
unpatriotic
perhaps
a
more
appropriate
question
would
be
why
is
tax
avoidance
not
considered
unpatriotic
the
answer
to
this
is
simple
tax
avoidance
is
simply
defined
as
paying
the
minimum
tax
you
are
legally
obligated
to
pay
there
is
a
deeper
reason
taxes
by
their
very
nature
are
unamerican
one
need
only
look
at
the
birth
and
history
of
the

to
see
this
fact
wasnt
the
beef

over
taxation
without

not
taxation
itself
from
my

dim
recollection
of

most

all

this
newsgroup
consistently
refuses
to
admit

drugs
like
heroin
even
have
negative
side

heroin
is
a
relatively
safe
drug
what
makes
it
unsafe
are
iv
administration
and
shit
like
adulterants
there
are
side
effects
like
withdrawal
but
they
effect
people
differently
ive
seen
numerous
posts
claiming
heroin
has
lower
addiction
rates
that
cigarettes
which
might
be
true
but
it
is
very
deceiving
because
heroin
is
much
more
harmful
drug
to
be
addicted
to
than
cigarettes
heroin
addicts
are
far
more
prone
to
end
up

destroy
their

and

people
addicted

stereotypical
statement
i
know
people
who
use
heroin
and
opiates
that
function
just
fine
in
society
this
group
does
provide
some
very
good
information
to
people
but
i
am
worried
that
the
prolegalizationprodecriminalization
movement
is
being
hurt
when
it
refuses
to
admit
that
anysome
drugs
are
very
harmful
name
some
of
these
drugs
so
we
can
debate
about
them
more
specifically
im
all
for
legalization
of
most
drugs
but
when
someone
asks
me
about
relative
risks
of
certain
drugs
or
possible
bad
side
effects
i
would
like
to
know
themand
not
be
given

runaround

this
groupwhich
recently
tried
to
tell
me
that
pot
was
not
harmful
in
any
manner
to
peoples
lungs
no
no
no
or
at
least
i
havent
been
arguing
this
there
is
not
enough
data

form
a
scientific
conclusion
that
doesnt
mean
that
cannabis
is
benign

users
lungs
we
can
form
all
the
theories
we
want
but
they
are
only
theories
some
theories
are
supported
by
more
evidence
than
others
and
that
makes
them
stronger

think
its
time
yall

your
positions

try

you
cannot

get
this
straight
after
a
nice
long
rant
about
how
people
need
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
their
economic
and
social
lives
all
of
a
sudden
radicals
such
as
me
i
guess
are
responsible
for
poor
peoples
lifestyles
tell
me
how
that
worksor
do
you
think
that
poor
people
are
just
too
dumb
to
think
for
themselves
there
are
many
reasons
for
the
disintegration
of
the
family
and

systems
in

it
seemed
like
a
good

at

how
were
we

we
took
that

were
the
most
spoiled

irresponsible
the

fathers
that
were
determined
that
their
kids
would
not
want

anything
going
overboard
and
creating
a

the
contrast
between
two
famous

in
july
of
apollo
and
woodstock
which
group
had
large
numbers
of
people
that
could
not
feed
themselves
and
reverted
to
the
cultural
level
of
primitives
defecation
in

and
which
group
assembled
took
care
of
itself
and
dispersed
with
no

no
deaths
no
large

wartime
censorship
on
all
sides
but
as
i
say
these
words
the
naval
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
is
about
to
come
to
the
surface
beginning
today
april
a
total
naval
and
air
blockade
of
the
falklands
by
the
royal
navy
has
begun
at
the
same
time
a
counterblockade
has
been
declared
by
argentina
in
the
same
area
to
be
effective
a
blockade
must
be
imposed
over
a
period
of
time
but
the
royal
navy
does
not
have
that
much
time
winter
is
coming
on
in
the
south
atlantic
and
the
british
supply
lines
are
overextended
having
come
this
far
her
majestys
navy
cannot
simply
drop
the
blockade
and
sail
away
in
a
few
weeks
time
without
drawing
blood
from
argentina
as
a
result
the
british
will
be
forced
to
undertake
military
operations
very
soon
no
matter
how
risky
they
may
be
there
is
also
another
reason
why
the
royal
navy
now
has
no
choice
but
to
engage
the
argentine
forces
in
combat
that
reason
my
friends
is
that
the
royal
navy
has
already
suffered
losses
in
secret
combat
this
month
up
to
this
moment
there
will
be
no
way
to
explain
away
the
damage
which
has
been
sustained
by
the
british
fleet
only
when
publicly
admitted
fighting
erupts
will
the
british
dare
to
admit
that
they
have
suffered
battle
losses
to
obtain
that
cover
story
the
british
have
no
choice
but
to
sail
into
combat
but
in
doing
so
they
will
be
risking
even
heavier
losses
on
top
of
those
already
sustained
in
short
my
friends
her
majestys
navy
has
sailed
into
a
trap
the
events
now
unfolding
in
the
south
atlantic
carry
strange
ironic
echoes
of
the
past
for
weeks
now
weve
been
hearing
countless
commentators
referring
to
the
british
task
force
as
an
armada
quote
the
british
of
all
people
ought
to
be
very
uneasy
with
that
description
the
original
spanish
armada
years
ago
was
renowned
as
a
seemingly
invincible
fighting
force
but
it
came
to
grief
in
a
naval
disaster
so
complete
that
it
changed
the
course
of
historyand
it
was
none
other
than
the
english
navy
that
destroyed
the
spanish
armada
the
original
spanish
armada
put
to
sea
in
during
the
reign
of
englands
queen
elizabeth
i
the
armada
was
an
invasion
fleet
carrying
thousands
of
crack
fighting
men
to
invade
england
they
were
met
by
the
daring
sea
dogs
of
sir
francis
drake
drake
and
his
small
fast
ships
turned
the
tables
on
the
spanish
armada
by
changing
the
rules
of
battle
the
english
fleet
was
equipped
with
new
longerrange
guns
and
it
stayed
upwind
and
out
of
reach
from
there
the
english
pounded
smashed
and
shattered
the
big
ships
of
the
mighty
armada
when
it
was
all
over
barely
half
the
spanish
fleet
was
left
to
limp
back
to
port
drakes
defeat
of
the
spanish
armada
was
a
shock
to
the
world
it
opened
the
door
for
england
under
queen
elizabeth
i
to
start
its
expansion
into
a
truly
global
empire
today
years
later
history
seems
to
have
come
full
circle
queen
elizabeth
ii
is
witnessing
the
dismantling
of
the
world
empire
whose
heyday
began
under
queen
elizabeth
i
and
now
the
cultures
of
england
and
of
spain
are
once
again
in
confrontation
once
again
a
socalled
armada
is
preparing
for
invasion
but
this
time
the
armada
is
british
not
spanish
four
hundred
years
ago
sir
francis
drake
was
the
hero
of
the
day
today
the
ghost
of
francis
drake
is
once
again
on
the
scene
the
south
atlantic
war
zone
is
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
drake
passage
around
the
southern
tip
of
south
america
the
defeat
of
the
spanish
armada
four
centuries
ago
broke
the
back
of
spains
naval
supremacy
and
now
the
defeat
of
the
new
british
armada
may
well
break
the
back
of
what
remains
of
the
once
glorious
royal
navy

the
falkland
islands
crisis
began
early
this
month
it
looked
at
first
like
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
for
a
century
and
a
half
since
the
islands
have
been
controlled
by
great
britain
during
that
entire
time
british
sovereignty
over
the
falklands
has
been
disputed
by
argentina
there
have
been
countless
threats
by
argentina
to
seize
the
islands
which
it
calls
the
malvinas
but
the
threats
have
always
come
to
nothing
in
the
past
and
britain
has
never
even
gotten
very
worried
about
them
the
islands
are
four
times
as
distant
from
argentina
as
cuba
is
from
the
united
states
and
they
are
not
much
of
a
prize
after
years
of
occupancy
the
falklands
are
home
to
fewer
than
british
settlers
and
a
lot
of
sheep
in
short
the
remote
falkland
islands
hardly
look
like
something
to
fight
over
and
yet
here
we
are
watching
another
crisis
take
place
we
are
watching
as
war
erupts
between
great
britain
and
argentina
the
thatcher
government
is
acting
as
if
it
has
forgotten
all
about
its
usual
preoccupation
with
the
soviet
threat
at
natos
doorstep
instead
britain
is
throwing
almost
everything
its
got
at
argentinaaircraft
carriers
cruisers
destroyers
submarines
assault
shipsyou
name
it
luxury
cruise
ships
have
even
been
commissioned
and
turned
into
troop
carriers
overnight
wave
after
wave
of
additional
assault
troops
have
been
activated
and
sent
to
join
the
fleet
even
after
it
sailed
ships
and
submarines
have
been
pulled
off
station
from
normal
nato
duty
and
sent
to
reinforce
the
task
force
the
initial
force
has
grown
steadily
over
the
past
several
weeks
into
an
armada
numbering
over
over
twothirds
of
the
entire
royal
navy
has
already
been
deployed
to
the
south
atlantic
off
argentina
watching
all
this
a
lot
of
people
are
asking
whats
this
fight
really
all
about
the
most
popular
answer
suggested
in
the
major
media
is
oil
vast
deposits
of
oil
are
known
to
exist
under
the
continental
shelf
between
argentina
and
the
falklands
but
that
has
been
known
for
nearly
years
in
no
way
does
it
explain
the
timing
of
the
sudden
military
offensive
by
argentina
this
month
and
oil
explains
even
less
about
the
argentine
seizure
of
south
georgia
island
south
georgia
island
is
miles
east
of
the
falklands
with
no
known
oil
deposits
anywhere
near
it
and
compared
to
south
georgia
the
falklands
are
an
island
paradise
south
georgia
island
is
covered
with
rugged
mountains
treacherous
valleys
glaciers
and
semipermanent
snow
most
of
it
is
uninhabitable
on
top
of
all
that
argentina
has
absolutely
no
legal
or
historical
claim
to
south
georgia
island
in
that
respect
it
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
falklands
in
the
early
the
falklands
were
occupied
for
a
while
by
argentine
colonists
in
the
british
expelled
them
and
took
over
the
island
for
that
and
other
historical
reasons
argentina
argues
that
the
falklands
really
belong
to
argentina
not
britain
but
no
such
argument
is
possible
for
south
georgia
island
it
has
always
been
controlled
by
britain
never
by
argentina
or
spain
the
argentine
seizure
of
south
georgia
island
looks
even
more
unreasonable
from
a
military
point
of
view
argentinas
leaders
are
military
men
and
they
think
in
military
terms
they
were
well
aware
ahead
of
time
that
faroff
south
georgia
island
could
not
possibly
be
held
for
long
by
seizing
it
they
were
setting
themselves
up
to
absorb
a
military
defeat
as
the
island
was
retaken
by
britain
so
the
question
is
why
did
argentinas
military
junta
bother
with
the
seemingly
worthless
south
georgia
island
at
all
my
friends
the
answers
to
all
these
questions
are
military
not
political
or
economic
south
georgia
island
possesses
an
enormous
military
secret
its
a
giant
underground
installation
buried
under
the
mountains
at
the
northwest
end
of
the
island
the
real
reason
for
the
socalled
falkland
crisis
is
this
secret
installation
together
with
two
other
similar
installations
which
i
will
describe
shortly
the
secret
military
complexes
have
been
in
existence
for
many
years
they
are
not
new
what
is
new
is
the
accelerated
nuclear
war
timetable
of
the
american
bolshevik
war
planners
here
in
washington
for
the
past
two
months
ive
been
reporting
the
details
of
this
new
war
plan
to
you
as
quickly
as
i
can
obtain
and
verify
them
the
plan
calls
for
nuclear
war
one
to
erupt
by
september
of
this
year
it
is
this
fastapproaching
nuclear
war
threat
that
caused
the
socalled
falklands
crisis
to
erupt
now
what
is
going
on
now
is
a
coordinated
effort
to
spoil
part
of
the
bolshevik
grand
strategy
for
the
coming
nuclear
war
the
mutual
enemies
of
the
american
bolsheviks
herenamely
the
rockefeller
carteland
russias
new
rulers
in
the
kremlin
are
behind
the
present
crisis
they
are
trying
to
ruin
phase
of
the
project
z
war
plan
which
i
revealed
last
month
that
phase
is
to
be
world
domination
by
the
american
bolsheviks
after
both
russia
and
the
united
states
have
been
destroyed
in
nuclear
war
one
as
i
mentioned
last
month
the
key
to
this
plan
is
the
existence
of
secret
weapons
stockpiles
in
various
places
around
the
world
the
american
bolshevik
military
planners
here
in
america
are
working
with
other
bolshevik
agents
in
key
military
positions
of
other
countries
to
set
off
war
having
done
that
they
intend
to
ride
out
the
nuclear
holocaust
they
have
caused
safe
and
cozy
in
government
war
bunkers
when
the
warring
nations
finally
lie
smoldering
and
exhausted
the
bolsheviks
will
leave
the
shattered
remains
of
their
host
countries
they
will
rendezvous
at
the
secret
weapons
installations
and
bring
their
weapons
into
the
open
they
will
confront
the
world
with
the
only
remaining
fresh
uptodate
powerful
military
force
on
earth
and
using
that
military
power
they
will
become
the
undisputed
rulers
of
the
worldthat
is
they
plan
to
do
all
this
and
they
plan
to
pave
the
way
for
world
domination
very
soon
by
setting
off
nuclear
war
one
in
a
matter
of
months
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
russias
new
antibolshevik
rulers
are
working
together
in
a
race
against
time
to
try
to
head
off
the
bolshevik
war
plan
last
month
i
mentioned
that
the
bolsheviks
here
are
benefitting
from
war
preparations
which
were
started
by
the
rockefellers
long
ago
it
has
only
been
about
three
years
since
the
rockefellers
were
dislodged
as
the
prime
movers
of
the
united
states
government
by
the
bolsheviks
since
that
time
the
united
states
government
has
been
a
house
divided
torn
by
internal
power
struggles
between
rival
bolshevik
and
rockefeller
factions
but
before
that
the
united
states
had
been
dominated
for
decades
both
economically
and
politically
by
the
four
rockefeller
brothers
in
the
brothers
launched
a
new
longrange
plan
for
world
domination
it
was
a
twoprong
strategy
half
visible
and
half
secret
which
i
first
described
long
ago
in
audio
letter
no
it
was
a
plan
for
the
united
states
to
arm
to
the
teeth
in
secret
while
appearing
to
disarm
gradually
without
repeating
all
the
details
the
basic
idea
was
grandiose
yet
simple
by
deliberately
appearing
weak
the
rockefellercontrolled
united
states
would
maneuver
itself
into
a
nuclear
war
with
russia
then
the
secret
weapons
including
superweapons
would
be
unleashed
to
smash
russia
and
take
over
the
world
when
they
set
the
grand
plan
in
motion
in
the
rockefeller
brothers
were
looking
ahead
to
a
nuclear
war
by
the
late
their
military
analysts
concluded
very
early
that
the
war
being
planned
would
have
very
different
effects
on
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
both
superpowers
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
are
located
well
up
in
the
northern
hemisphere
so
are
the
other
fullfledged
nuclear
powersgreat
britain
france
red
china
and
india
by
contrast
the
strategic
targets
for
nuclear
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
are
relatively
few
and
far
between
in
other
words
it
was
expected
that
the
coming
nuclear
war
would
be
essentially
a
northern
hemisphere
war
in
an
allout
nuclear
holocaust
it
is
known
that
serious
radioactive
fallout
will
gradually
spread
to
affect
even
areas
not
initially
hit
by
war
but
there
are
limits
to
how
far
the
war
clouds
can
spread
it
was
discovered
long
ago
that
there
is
very
little
mixing
between
the
air
of
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
in
the
northern
half
of
our
planet
cold
air
from
the
north
pole
works
its
way
southward
towards
the
equator
then
it
works
its
way
back
to
the
north
as
warm
air
a
mirror
image
of
this
process
takes
up
the
southern
half
of
the
planet
northern
and
southern
hemisphere
air
meet
in
the
equatorial
zone
but
very
little
of
the
air
changes
places
the
military
conclusion
my
friends
is
this
the
coming
nuclear
war
could
ruin
large
areas
of
the
northern
hemisphere
for
generations
to
come
but
if
the
calculations
are
right
the
southern
hemisphere
could
escape
virtually
unaffected
by
the
war
this
was
music
to
the
ears
of
the
four
rockefeller
brothers
a
quick
look
at
the
globe
of
the
world
shows
why
the
rockefeller
cartel
has
dominated
latin
america
ever
since
world
war
ii
as
i
discussed
in
my
very
first
monthly
audio
letter
nelson
rockefeller
solidified
the
cartel
grip
on
latin
america
during
the
war
he
accomplished
this
as
socalled
coordinator
of
hemispheric
defense
for
thenpresident
franklin
d
roosevelt
so
that
takes
care
of
the
south
american
continent
and
its
natural
resources
then
there
is
the
african
continent
there
too
rockefeller
control
was
already
in
effect
over
wide
areas
of
black
africa
especially
south
of
the
equator
all
this
was
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
john
d
rockefeller
iii
as
i
detailed
in
audio
letter
no
looking
around
the
globe
the
most
important
remaining
land
masses
from
the
standpoint
of
world
domination
are
australia
and
new
zealand
thanks
to
world
war
ii
both
were
wide
open
to
the
rockefellers
the
rockefeller
brothers
decided
to
establish
secret
military
installations
in
the
southern
hemisphere
for
use
after
the
coming
war
by
this
means
they
expected
to
become
the
masters
of
the
surviving
southern
half
of
planet
earth
after
the
northern
hemisphere
war
then
as
the
northern
hemisphere
gradually
recovered
from
the
nuclear
holocaust
the
rockefeller
empire
would
be
able
to
pick
up
the
pieces
in
this
way
the
third
generation
rockefeller
brothers
expected
their
family
dynasty
to
inherit
the
earth
in
order
to
control
the
southern
hemisphere
militarily
after
the
war
some
means
would
have
to
be
available
to
project
military
power
onto
any
land
mass
for
example
revolts
against
rockefeller
domination
would
require
troopsnot
a
blast
from
the
beam
weapons
on
the
moon
the
most
critical
factor
for
postwar
military
domination
of
the
world
was
found
to
be
a
navy
a
minimum
of
two
secret
naval
fleets
would
be
requiredone
based
in
the
south
atlantic
the
other
in
the
south
pacific
since
the
reserve
naval
fleets
were
to
be
kept
secret
until
after
the
northern
hemisphere
nuclear
war
they
could
not
be
built
in
existing
shipyards
new
construction
facilities
had
to
be
built
and
they
had
to
be
hidden
to
hide
an
entire
shipyard
is
no
small
task
they
take
up
a
lot
of
space
on
top
of
that
it
was
essential
that
the
ships
remain
hidden
after
they
were
built
the
best
way
to
achieve
that
was
to
combine
the
shipyard
and
naval
base
into
one
overall
secret
installation
finally
the
secret
naval
installation
had
to
be
invulnerable
to
nuclear
attack
otherwise
if
its
existence
were
ever
discovered
prematurely
the
secret
navy
might
be
wiped
out
the
combined
requirements
for
secrecy
space
and
protection
against
attack
were
formidable
but
one
day
in
while
all
these
plans
were
still
in
the
early
stages
of
development
the
answer
presented
itself
during
a
socalled
banking
trip
to
sweden
david
rockefeller
was
given
a
tour
of
a
unique
hidden
naval
port
the
port
is
hollowed
out
from
solid
granite
cliffs
which
come
right
down
to
the
water
the
entrance
to
the
port
is
a
gigantic
hole
in
the
side
of
the
cliff
which
can
be
sealed
off
with
enormous
steel
doors
inside
this
big
doorway
on
the
water
a
huge
cavity
has
been
hollowed
out
to
accommodate
ships
the
rockefeller
brothers
and
their
military
adviser
decided
that
a
bigger
more
secret
better
protected
version
of
the
swedish
hidden
port
was
just
what
they
wanted
a
survey
of
candidate
sites
was
then
initiated
the
site
survey
covered
coastal
areas
throughout
the
southern
hemisphere
many
areas
were
rejected
very
quickly
because
the
topography
was
wrong
other
areas
were
rejected
because
they
were
too
close
to
the
equator
still
others
had
to
be
ruled
out
because
there
were
too
many
people
living
nearby
making
the
desired
level
of
secrecy
impossible
finally
it
was
essential
that
the
sites
chosen
for
the
secret
naval
installations
be
totally
secure
politically
at
last
the
sites
for
the
secret
naval
installations
were
selected
in
the
south
pacific
extreme
southern
new
zealand
was
selected
this
is
what
i
was
alluding
to
in
audio
letter
no
three
months
ago
when
i
called
attention
to
new
zealands
extreme
importance
in
the
coming
war
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
space
the
secret
new
zealand
naval
installation
had
to
be
divided
up
into
two
sites
located
close
together
one
is
at
the
extreme
southwest
tip
of
south
island
where
the
mountain
range
known
as
the
southern
alps
comes
down
virtually
to
the
waters
edge
the
other
part
of
the
installation
is
built
into
the
northwest
tip
of
stewart
island
which
is
off
the
tip
of
south
island
the
stewart
island
facility
is
hollowed
out
within
a
rise
known
as
mt
anglem
the
new
zealand
location
met
all
the
requirements
ever
since
world
war
ii
the
government
of
new
zealand
has
been
tied
even
closer
to
the
united
states
than
to
great
britain
the
location
is
far
from
the
equator
and
the
installations
are
buried
deep
under
mountains
protected
from
nuclear
attack
they
are
also
too
deep
to
be
reached
by
particlebeam
attacks
and
the
new
zealand
site
is
well
situated
to
command
the
entire
south
pacific
in
the
south
atlantic
an
even
more
perfect
site
was
found
that
site
my
friends
is
south
georgia
island
it
is
located
perfectly
for
naval
domination
of
the
entire
south
atlantic
the
tall
rugged
mountains
provided
a
perfect
location
for
the
secret
installation
at
the
northwest
tip
of
the
long
island
it
is
controlled
by
great
britain
whose
government
like
that
of
new
zealand
was
willing
to
cooperate
and
south
georgia
island
was
virtually
uninhabited
except
for
a
whaling
station
on
the
northeast
coast
the
whaling
station
was
some
miles
away
from
the
secret
new
installation
which
was
being
built
but
britain
took
no
chances
in
the
whaling
station
was
closed
down
since
that
time
there
have
been
no
inhabitants
on
south
georgia
island
except
for
a
few
dozen
alleged
antarctic
scientists
construction
of
the
secret
naval
facilitiestwo
in
new
zealand
one
on
south
georgia
islandbegan
in
the
early
the
techniques
were
adapted
from
those
used
previously
to
build
other
large
underground
facilities
such
as
the
norad
installation
inside
cheyenne
mountain
colorado
however
these
techniques
were
adapted
in
radically
new
ways
to
achieve
construction
access
directly
from
the
sea
instead
of
overland
in
this
way
the
sheltering
mountain
was
left
undisturbed
in
appearance
both
during
and
after
construction
the
cuts
in
the
mountain
side
which
were
necessary
to
let
ships
in
and
out
were
kept
as
small
as
possible
and
were
well
camouflaged
like
the
swedish
hidden
naval
port
arrangement
the
entrances
to
the
secret
installations
can
be
sealed
up
when
sealed
the
entrance
is
virtually
impossible
to
detect
unless
you
know
exactly
where
it
is
and
unlike
most
large
construction
projects
there
are
no
tailings
or
piles
of
leftover
rock
lying
around
to
attract
attention
the
manmade
caverns
which
house
the
secret
naval
installations
are
enormous
but
all
the
rock
and
debris
was
disposed
of
at
sea
once
the
secret
naval
facilities
were
built
they
had
to
be
outfitted
for
ship
construction
and
docksite
storage
the
fake
disarmament
of
the
united
states
during
the
contributed
greatly
to
this
task
from
to
one
man
played
a
pivotal
role
in
this
elaborate
rockefeller
scheme
he
was
thensecretary
of
defense
robert
mcnamara
all
through
the
mcnamara
presided
over
the
public
paring
back
of
americas
visible
military
power
this
included
the
closing
down
and
dismantling
of
entire
shipyards
what
we
were
not
told
was
where
all
that
shipyard
equipment
went
afterwards
where
it
went
my
friends
was
to
the
new
secret
installations
which
were
being
outfitted
in
new
zealand
and
south
georgia
island
the
secret
naval
installations
have
been
used
as
duplication
facilities
to
reproduce
certain
ships
and
submarines
designed
and
built
here
in
the
united
states
as
defense
secretary
caspar
weinberger
told
congress
recently
it
is
cheaper
to
build
two
ships
at
a
time
that
is
especially
true
if
the
second
ship
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
first
this
has
become
even
more
true
in
recent
years
through
the
use
of
computerized
manufacturing
techniques
the
secret
naval
fleets
which
have
been
built
at
the
secret
installations
are
made
up
of
duplicatesexact
duplicates
of
certain
other
ships
and
submarines
they
are
all
nuclear
powerednuclear
subs
nuclear
cruisers
nuclear
destroyers
and
yes
nuclear
aircraft
carriers
three
of
them
a
secret
twin
was
built
for
the
uss
nimitz
for
the
uss
eisenhower
and
for
the
newlylaunched
uss
carl
vincent
all
have
been
financed
through
the
gigantic
cost
overruns
so
called
that
we
constantly
hear
about
in
the
defense
department
and
all
three
carriers
have
been
provided
with
a
full
complement
of
aircraft
whose
manufacture
was
financed
the
same
way
the
ships
of
the
secret
american
bolshevik
naval
fleets
are
all
duplicates
of
other
nuclearpowered
vessels
even
so
the
secret
naval
ships
possess
one
key
difference
last
month
i
revealed
that
the
socalled
stealth
program
has
succeeded
in
developing
a
kind
of
electromagnetic
invisibility
shield
this
technique
makes
an
object
invisible
from
a
distance
by
distorting
light
waves
in
its
vicinity
a
whole
new
fleet
of
phantom
warplanes
are
now
going
into
crash
production
that
use
this
principle
and
my
friends
all
of
the
secret
american
bolshevik
navy
ships
have
already
been
outfitted
with
similar
stealthfield
equipment
the
stealth
principle
is
actually
easier
to
apply
to
ships
than
to
airplanes
because
there
is
more
room
for
the
powerful
equipment
that
generates
the
field
after
nuclear
war
one
the
secret
stealth
navy
of
the
american
bolsheviks
would
be
light
years
ahead
of
any
other
navy
left
on
earth
it
would
be
perfect
for
the
intended
role
of
world
domination
the
rockefellers
set
it
all
in
motion
long
ago
my
friends
but
three
years
ago
they
lost
control
of
the
united
states
military
now
its
the
american
bolsheviks
who
are
in
control
and
they
are
bent
on
war
these
secret
naval
installations
have
precipitated
what
is
being
called
the
falklands
crisis
topic
audio
letterr
no
last
month
i
described
project
z
the
new
bolshevik
threephase
strategy
for
nuclear
war
one
an
elite
group
of
american
bolshevik
military
planners
here
are
flushing
out
the
plan
right
now
at
a
secret
warroom
here
in
washington
its
a
plan
by
which
the
united
states
will
strike
the
first
nuclear
blow
followed
by
allout
thermonuclear
war
with
russia
having
set
off
the
holocaust
the
bolsheviks
here
and
in
certain
other
countries
plan
to
rise
it
out
safe
in
comfortable
war
bunkers
finally
after
nuclear
war
one
fizzles
out
in
stalemate
they
plan
to
leave
behind
the
ashes
of
the
united
states
and
her
allies
activating
phase
of
their
grand
strategy
they
plan
to
unveil
their
secret
weapons
especially
their
secret
naval
fleets
with
these
they
plan
to
conquer
and
rule
what
is
left
of
the
world
the
united
states
as
we
know
it
will
be
dead
and
gone
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
bolsheviks
themselves
this
outcome
will
constitute
victory
up
to
now
the
nuclear
war
timetable
which
i
first
revealed
two
months
ago
is
still
on
track
they
are
still
shooting
for
nuclear
war
to
begin
by
september
of
this
year
time
is
fast
running
out
the
bolsheviks
here
are
sprinting
as
fast
as
they
can
toward
war
but
my
friends
the
bolsheviks
are
not
the
only
runners
in
this
race
they
have
two
deadly
enemies
both
of
whom
are
equally
determined
to
trip
up
the
bolsheviks
one
enemy
of
the
bolsheviks
here
is
the
rockefeller
cartel
the
other
enemy
is
the
new
antibolshevik
ruling
clique
in
russia
and
now
these
two
mutual
enemies
of
the
bolsheviks
are
pooling
their
efforts
in
certain
ways
in
audio
letter
no
three
months
ago
i
reported
that
a
limited
new
antibolshevik
coalition
was
in
the
works
between
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
the
january
meeting
between
haig
and
gromyko
in
geneva
switzerland
was
a
turning
point
in
the
formation
of
this
coalition
it
is
now
a
reality
and
is
responsible
for
the
socalled
falkland
crisis
now
dominating
the
headlines
it
should
be
emphasized
that
this
new
relationship
between
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
russia
falls
far
short
of
a
true
alliance
they
have
very
major
disputes
to
be
settled
between
them
but
for
the
time
being
they
have
called
a
truce
between
themselves
to
deal
with
their
mutual
deadly
enemythe
bolsheviks
here
in
america
the
first
priority
of
the
russians
and
the
rockefellers
is
to
slow
down
the
bolshevik
preparations
for
imminent
nuclear
war
if
they
can
do
that
time
is
on
the
side
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
in
certain
political
movements
which
i
discussed
last
summer
in
audio
letter
no
a
slowdown
in
the
nuclear
war
timetable
will
also
give
more
breathing
space
for
additional
antibolshevik
actions
to
be
implemented
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
planners
decided
by
midfebruary
that
military
action
against
the
bolsheviks
was
essential
very
quickly
no
other
type
of
action
had
any
hope
of
taking
effect
fast
enough
to
prevent
nuclear
war
by
the
end
of
this
summer
the
exact
details
of
the
project
z
war
plan
are
not
known
to
either
the
rockefellers
or
the
russians
but
the
general
outlines
are
known
to
be
as
i
described
last
month
it
was
decided
that
military
action
should
be
devised
that
would
undermine
phase
of
the
bolshevik
war
planthat
is
the
bolshevikcontrolled
secret
naval
installations
and
fleets
in
the
southern
hemisphere
should
be
attacked
and
crippled
by
working
together
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
were
able
to
devise
an
attack
plan
which
neither
could
have
carried
out
alone
the
rockefeller
group
who
built
and
originally
controlled
these
bases
provided
detailed
intelligence
about
the
best
way
to
attack
them
the
russians
with
their
enormous
military
machine
provided
the
muscle
to
actually
carry
out
the
attack
it
was
essential
to
devise
a
scheme
that
would
enable
both
secret
fleets
in
the
south
atlantic
and
south
pacific
to
be
attacked
survival
intact
of
either
fleet
would
leave
the
bolshevik
war
plan
still
workable
military
analysts
concluded
very
quickly
that
a
direct
assault
on
the
new
zealand
facilities
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
no
combination
of
commandos
frogmen
or
other
military
force
which
could
possibly
keep
an
attack
secret
from
the
outside
world
any
attack
on
the
new
zealand
bases
would
set
off
the
very
war
which
the
rockefellers
and
russians
want
to
prevent
but
the
situation
in
the
south
atlantic
was
a
different
matter
in
a
way
the
greatest
asset
of
south
georgia
island
was
also
its
achilles
heel
the
extreme
isolation
which
protected
the
secrecy
of
the
south
georgia
base
also
made
a
covert
military
assault
feasible
the
key
lay
with
argentina
and
her
longstanding
claims
to
the
falkland
islands
as
i
mentioned
in
topic
the
rockefeller
cartel
has
dominated
all
of
latin
america
for
decades
cartel
operatives
were
sent
to
argentina
to
work
out
a
deal
with
the
government
military
junta
there
the
historic
dispute
over
the
falkland
islands
was
to
be
used
to
provide
a
ruse
a
military
cover
to
enable
the
south
georgia
base
to
be
attacked
the
argentine
generals
were
not
told
everything
about
the
situation
by
any
means
but
they
were
told
enough
to
make
clear
what
they
were
to
do
as
an
inducement
to
cooperate
the
argentine
leaders
were
promised
handsome
rewards
they
were
guaranteed
that
after
the
shooting
was
over
the
falkland
islands
would
remain
in
argentine
hands
this
guarantee
included
the
promise
of
covert
military
assistance
as
needed
against
the
royal
navy
and
to
bolster
the
troubled
argentine
economy
it
was
promised
that
the
rockefeller
cartel
will
help
develop
the
immense
offshore
oil
reserves
with
these
combined
promises
of
military
glory
and
financial
rewards
the
argentine
military
junta
agreed
to
the
plan
on
march
argentina
carried
out
act
in
the
joint
attack
plan
a
group
of
argentine
scrapmetal
merchants
of
all
things
landed
at
the
abandoned
old
whaling
station
on
south
georgia
island
supposedly
they
were
there
to
dismantle
the
old
buildings
and
cart
them
off
to
sell
while
they
were
at
it
they
also
raised
the
argentine
flag
over
the
worksite
the
british
always
nervous
about
south
georgia
island
promptly
reacted
as
expected
the
british
antarctic
survey
ship
endurance
put
marines
ashore
they
drove
off
the
scrap
merchants
and
tore
down
the
argentine
flag
the
incident
provided
the
desired
excuse
for
the
argentine
junta
to
bring
the
simmering
falklands
dispute
to
a
boil
from
time
to
time
in
the
past
argentina
has
claimed
that
south
georgia
is
part
of
the
falklands
because
it
is
administered
that
way
by
britain
that
argument
is
very
flimsy
but
it
now
came
in
very
handy
it
was
nothing
new
to
hear
this
from
argentine
leaders
so
there
was
no
hint
of
what
was
really
afoot
during
late
march
argentine
military
forces
started
assembling
for
an
assault
on
the
falklands
nothing
new
thought
the
british
high
command
argentina
has
carried
out
threatening
maneuvers
in
the
past
many
times
it
was
believed
that
they
were
about
to
do
it
again
but
on
april
argentine
forces
did
the
unexpected
after
many
past
false
alarms
this
time
they
actually
invaded
and
seized
the
islands
all
argentine
public
statements
emphasized
the
longstanding
historical
claims
to
the
falklands
themselves
but
just
for
good
measure
the
next
day
a
small
argentine
force
also
seized
faroff
south
georgia
island
the
force
was
so
small
that
it
gave
the
appearance
initially
that
it
was
just
a
side
show
from
argentinas
point
of
view
however
the
small
contingent
of
royal
marines
were
overpowered
and
bundled
off
the
island
along
with
a
group
of
alleged
scientists
that
was
the
moment
of
payoff
in
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
attack
plan
thanks
to
the
elaborate
distraction
staged
by
the
argentine
forces
a
special
commando
team
got
onto
the
island
undetected
based
on
the
detailed
rockefeller
information
about
the
base
the
team
moved
to
a
location
on
the
mountain
directly
above
the
cavernous
secret
base
special
highspeed
drilling
equipment
was
set
up
by
the
rockefeller
members
of
the
team
while
the
russian
members
concentrated
on
military
defense
by
late
that
evening
april
the
military
high
command
in
london
finally
learned
what
was
really
taking
place
the
secret
south
georgia
base
was
under
attack
by
virtually
the
only
means
possible
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
team
were
drilling
a
shaft
down
through
the
mountain
toward
the
hollowed
out
cavern
inside
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
until
their
drill
would
break
through
the
ceiling
of
the
giant
hidden
naval
base
once
the
hole
was
made
the
next
step
was
obvious
the
rockefellerrussian
team
would
put
a
weapon
of
some
kind
through
the
hole
the
best
guess
was
that
it
would
be
a
nerve
gas
the
shock
waves
that
went
through
the
highest
levels
of
the
british
government
on
the
evening
of
april
can
hardly
be
described
my
friends
the
thatcher
government
like
the
socalled
reagan
administration
here
in
america
is
bolshevik
controlled
thats
why
margaret
thatcher
always
says
me
too
any
time
the
reagan
administration
says
or
does
anything
against
russia
both
governments
are
party
to
the
secret
nuclear
war
plan
in
complete
betrayal
of
the
people
of
their
respective
countries
and
on
the
evening
of
april
they
suddenly
discovered
that
their
precious
war
plan
was
in
deep
deep
trouble
immediately
the
thatcher
government
started
assembling
a
naval
armada
to
sail
for
the
south
atlantic
haste
was
the
order
of
the
day
the
drilling
on
south
georgia
island
was
proceeding
around
the
clock
the
best
estimates
were
that
the
drilling
would
break
through
into
the
roof
of
the
naval
base
in
about
three
weeks
on
or
about
april
if
help
did
not
reach
south
georgia
by
then
the
secret
installation
might
be
doomed
the
forces
stationed
at
the
installation
itself
were
unable
to
defend
themselves
under
the
circumstances
their
mighty
naval
ships
were
ships
in
a
bottle
they
did
not
dare
open
the
bottle
to
sail
out
to
fight
because
the
russian
commandos
were
armed
with
tactical
and
nuclear
weapons
to
open
the
blastproof
entrance
doors
would
be
suicide
on
april
just
two
days
after
south
georgia
island
was
seized
some
naval
ships
began
moving
out
of
british
ports
the
same
day
lord
carrington
was
sacked
as
foreign
minister
he
was
forced
to
resign
my
friends
because
he
had
assisted
the
rockefeller
attack
plan
by
downplaying
the
argentine
attack
preparations
that
same
day
april
new
zealand
the
home
of
the
other
secret
naval
fleet
broke
diplomatic
relations
with
argentina
the
two
hidden
new
zealand
facilities
had
been
placed
on
red
alert
as
a
precautionary
measure
all
submarines
at
the
twin
base
were
ordered
to
sea
several
surface
ships
were
already
at
sea
undergoing
sea
trials
but
that
still
left
seven
major
ships
inside
the
hidden
twin
naval
base
including
one
of
the
nuclear
aircraft
carriers
i
mentioned
earlier
on
that
busy
day
of
april
argentinas
foreign
minister
costa
mendez
was
at
the
united
nations
in
new
york
he
was
alarmed
by
the
deployment
of
such
a
large
part
of
the
royal
navy
costa
mendez
hurried
here
to
washington
to
seek
reassurances
from
certain
officials
he
got
them
for
the
next
two
weeks
or
so
the
news
was
filled
with
stories
about
the
allegedly
slow
movement
of
the
british
fleet
while
negotiations
went
on
that
my
friends
was
only
a
cover
story
the
royal
navy
was
actually
joining
up
and
moving
as
rapidly
as
possible
toward
south
georgia
island
if
the
task
force
arrived
in
time
to
save
the
secret
base
a
major
battle
was
likely
the
official
stories
about
slow
movement
of
the
british
armada
were
intended
to
give
a
cushion
of
time
for
that
battle
if
need
be
the
fleet
would
have
several
days
to
retake
south
georgia
island
then
it
could
move
on
to
arrive
near
the
falklands
on
the
announced
schedule
in
this
way
the
crucial
importance
of
south
georgia
island
would
be
hidden
and
the
big
secret
preserved
it
was
initially
expected
that
advance
elements
of
the
british
fleet
would
reach
the
vicinity
of
south
georgia
island
within
two
weeks
that
would
have
been
soon
enough
to
attack
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
commando
team
and
stop
the
drilling
before
it
was
completed
but
russian
cosmospheres
and
submarines
made
a
shambles
of
the
plan
key
advance
elements
of
the
south
georgia
attack
contingent
left
ascension
island
early
april
two
days
before
it
was
announced
officially
shortly
after
they
did
so
they
ran
into
trouble
russian
cosmospheres
and
attack
submarines
closed
in
on
a
single
ship
which
was
critical
to
the
planned
counterassault
on
south
georgia
island
the
cosmospheres
bombarded
the
bridge
and
combat
information
center
of
the
ship
with
neutron
radiation
in
moments
the
ship
was
without
any
command
its
communications
and
radar
silenced
then
a
russian
sub
closed
in
and
quickly
finished
off
this
key
british
ship
with
torpedoes
it
broke
apart
with
secondary
explosions
and
sank
rapidly
so
far
as
is
known
there
were
no
survivors
this
unexpected
shock
in
the
midatlantic
produced
two
results
both
important
first
it
caused
a
slowdown
in
the
race
toward
the
south
atlantic
by
the
british
armada
the
task
force
had
to
be
regrouped
into
a
configuration
better
suited
for
an
enroute
defense
but
that
cost
valuable
time
public
announcements
from
london
about
the
progress
of
the
fleet
reflected
this
slowdown
the
timetable
for
arrival
on
battle
stations
near
the
falklands
started
stretching
out
longer
and
longer
all
this
bought
extra
time
for
the
joint
commando
team
on
south
georgia
island
the
drilling
continued
the
other
result
of
the
sinking
was
equally
important
word
was
flashed
to
the
south
pacific
stealth
navy
to
prepare
for
possible
action
it
was
obvious
that
the
russian
navy
was
getting
involved
in
the
atlantic
which
meant
that
the
royal
navy
could
be
in
big
trouble
during
the
dead
of
night
early
april
the
seven
stealth
ships
put
to
sea
from
their
twin
secret
bases
in
southern
new
zealand
they
deployed
to
a
secret
operational
headquarters
area
in
the
antipodes
islands
miles
southeast
of
new
zealand
their
electromagnetic
shields
were
operating
to
provide
protection
from
attack
these
shields
make
it
impossible
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world
or
even
to
see
it
as
i
explained
last
month
but
once
they
arrived
at
the
antipodes
the
stealth
ships
hooked
up
to
buoys
equipped
with
shielded
communication
cables
to
the
island
headquarters
the
antipodes
headquarters
in
turn
was
in
constant
touch
with
the
south
georgia
base
by
way
of
a
transoceanic
cable
around
the
tip
of
south
america
the
deployment
of
the
available
ships
of
the
south
pacific
stealth
fleet
was
exactly
what
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
planners
had
hoped
for
the
ships
had
been
flushed
out
from
their
essentially
invulnerable
hiding
place
in
new
zealand
the
british
ships
sinking
of
april
was
also
followed
by
other
events
on
april
the
argentine
navy
started
moving
out
of
port
the
same
day
alexander
haig
arrived
again
in
buenos
aires
supposedly
he
was
there
as
a
diplomat
but
in
reality
he
was
there
as
a
general
dealing
with
generals
haig
is
the
top
governmental
operative
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
as
i
have
revealed
in
the
past
he
was
making
sure
that
the
argentines
did
not
get
cold
feet
and
back
down
at
that
critical
moment
four
days
later
april
haig
left
for
washington
as
he
boarded
his
plane
haig
somberly
told
reporters
time
is
running
out
and
so
it
was
my
friends
for
the
secret
south
georgia
base
the
very
next
day
april
the
drill
broke
through
into
the
hollowedout
cavern
of
the
naval
base
bolshevik
military
analysts
in
london
had
not
expected
that
it
could
be
completed
until
at
least
the
following
weekend
the
british
fleet
was
still
out
of
range
the
weapon
which
the
commando
team
inserted
down
through
the
long
hole
was
a
small
compact
russian
neutron
bomb
when
it
was
detonated
inside
the
confines
of
the
huge
artificial
cave
the
effects
were
devastating
the
intense
radiation
instantly
killed
everyone
inside
the
base
also
the
heat
and
blast
effects
of
the
bomb
are
believed
to
have
damaged
all
the
ships
inside
sufficiently
to
badly
disable
them
meanwhile
russian
cosmospheres
and
submarines
were
converging
on
the
stealth
ships
which
were
near
the
antipodes
islands
awaiting
orders
from
a
distance
the
ships
were
invisible
to
the
eye
due
to
their
protective
shields
which
also
protect
against
beamweapon
attack
but
they
were
sitting
ducks
for
the
tactics
which
the
russians
employed
floating
overhead
the
cosmospheres
located
the
seven
ships
using
their
psychoenergetic
rangefinding
equipment
known
as
prf
as
i
have
reported
in
the
past
there
is
no
method
known
by
which
prf
can
be
jammed
the
cosmospheres
radioed
the
exact
locations
of
the
ships
to
the
attack
submarines
the
subs
were
armed
with
special
nonhoming
nonnuclear
torpedoes
designed
to
explode
on
impact
more
sophisticated
torpedoes
would
have
been
thrown
off
course
or
detonated
prematurely
by
the
protective
shield
of
each
ship
but
these
simple
torpedoes
just
cruise
right
through
each
invisibility
field
to
strike
the
ship
and
explode
within
minutes
after
the
attack
began
all
seven
bolshevik
stealth
ships
were
on
their
way
to
the
bottom
and
with
them
went
their
bolshevik
commanders
and
mercenary
crews
collected
from
around
the
world
the
south
pacific
action
took
place
just
after
sunset
local
time
the
time
here
in
washington
was
around
pm
april
that
evening
secretary
of
state
haig
was
seen
briefly
in
public
with
the
new
british
foreign
minister
francis
pym
pym
was
wearing
the
artificial
pseudosmile
which
diplomats
are
taught
always
to
display
in
public
but
not
haig
haig
was
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
and
no
wonder
the
joint
rockefellerrussian
military
operation
had
been
a
brilliant
success
the
secret
bolshevik
south
atlantic
fleet
had
been
virtually
wiped
out
bottled
up
inside
south
georgia
island
and
the
south
pacific
fleet
while
not
totally
wiped
out
had
been
badly
crippled
by
working
together
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
had
won
the
secret
naval
war
of
the
southern
hemisphere
topic
i
say
these
words
news
reports
give
the
impression
that
war
is
about
to
erupt
in
the
south
atlantic
but
the
real
war
in
the
southern
hemisphere
is
already
over
what
we
are
watching
now
is
the
beginning
of
its
bloody
aftermath
that
aftermath
is
the
battle
for
the
falkland
islands
they
have
been
promised
to
argentina
as
a
reward
for
her
role
in
the
secret
war
at
this
moment
the
bolsheviks
here
in
washington
are
pressing
for
a
public
announcement
that
the
united
states
will
side
with
britain
as
soon
as
that
takes
place
military
action
will
heat
up
fast
around
the
falklands
britain
has
no
choice
but
to
fight
she
has
already
suffered
casualties
which
cannot
be
explained
without
a
public
battle
but
by
fighting
the
bolsheviks
in
britain
are
running
the
risk
of
a
humiliating
and
tragic
defeat
for
the
royal
navy
meanwhile
the
rockefeller
strategists
here
are
now
concentrating
on
a
fastbuilding
antinuclearwar
campaign
on
all
sides
now
we
are
hearing
about
the
socalled
nuclear
freeze
movement
there
are
documentaries
articles
publicity
of
all
kinds
to
sensitize
us
to
the
terrors
of
nuclear
war
in
recent
months
there
have
even
been
referenda
popping
up
on
election
ballots
dealing
with
the
nuclear
war
issue
medical
doctors
are
banding
together
to
warn
the
public
about
what
would
happen
if
there
were
a
nuclear
war
we
are
being
told
that
all
this
is
just
popping
up
spontaneously
we
are
now
years
into
the
nuclear
age
and
nothing
like
this
has
ever
gained
so
much
momentum
before
yet
now
we
are
supposed
to
believe
that
millions
of
americans
have
spontaneously
gotten
the
same
ideas
at
the
same
time
if
you
believe
that
my
friends
i
give
up
movements
like
this
never
and
i
mean
never
develop
without
leadership
organization
and
moneyand
plenty
of
it
what
we
are
watching
is
the
rockefeller
public
relations
machine
at
work
as
ive
explained
in
the
past
the
rockefeller
cartel
cannot
afford
to
let
a
nuclear
war
take
place
if
it
does
they
will
lose
everything
because
they
are
not
in
a
position
to
control
it
instead
the
deadly
enemies
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
the
bolsheviks
here
will
win
out
if
there
is
a
war
and
so
the
rockefeller
faction
is
now
doing
everything
in
its
power
to
prevent
a
nuclear
war
the
present
antinuclearwar
orientation
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
creates
certain
temporary
common
interests
between
them
and
russia
but
as
russias
new
rulers
know
very
well
this
does
not
spring
from
any
great
moral
perspective
on
the
part
of
the
rockefeller
group
its
purely
a
matter
of
practical
necessity
right
now
for
the
rockefellers
the
russians
regard
the
united
states
as
a
house
divided
and
they
are
exploiting
that
division
by
working
in
careful
ways
with
the
rockefellers
their
first
priority
is
to
rid
the
world
of
the
deadly
bolshevik
menace
of
allout
even
suicidal
nuclear
war
but
once
that
is
done
they
know
that
there
will
be
a
day
of
reckoning
with
the
rockefeller
cartel
some
day
the
rockefeller
group
is
working
toward
a
definite
objective
with
their
new
antinuclearwar
propaganda
that
objective
is
renewed
powerand
power
that
moves
them
closer
to
their
old
dream
of
world
government
the
bolsheviks
here
have
unwittingly
provided
fertile
ground
for
the
powerful
new
rockefeller
antiwar
campaign
under
bolshevik
control
the
socalled
reagan
administration
has
become
so
hawkish
that
its
scaring
people
the
rockefeller
antiwar
campaign
is
designed
to
capitalize
on
that
latent
fear
as
a
tool
of
power
these
days
the
smell
of
war
is
in
the
air
the
falklands
crisis
is
helping
to
make
that
more
intense
the
rockefeller
propaganda
machine
is
now
paving
the
way
for
the
argument
that
surrender
of
sovereignty
is
the
only
way
to
avoid
war
a
new
superunited
nations
of
sorts
is
now
in
the
works
to
fill
the
bill
it
will
have
teeth
as
presently
envisioned
the
new
organization
will
be
based
in
geneva
switzerland
the
working
name
though
this
may
be
changed
is
the
world
nonproliferation
council
the
plan
is
to
bring
it
into
being
as
the
outgrowth
of
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaties
but
its
true
purpose
will
be
to
use
fearthe
fear
of
warto
control
us
all
last
minute
summary
now
its
time
for
my
last
minute
summary
in
this
audio
letter
i
have
reported
on
the
reasons
behind
the
socalled
falkland
islands
crisis
the
crisis
erupted
because
of
secret
bolshevikcontrolled
naval
installations
in
the
southern
hemisphere
these
have
been
attacked
by
joint
action
of
the
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
russians
in
an
attempt
to
slow
down
the
nuclearwar
timetable
the
attacks
were
successful
but
the
results
remain
to
be
seen
one
result
though
is
that
the
royal
navy
has
now
been
drawn
into
a
trap
britains
waterloo
at
sea
may
well
be
at
hand
my
friends
two
factions
are
struggling
for
control
over
our
united
statesthe
rockefeller
cartel
and
the
bolsheviks
they
differ
in
style
but
both
seek
to
control
us
through
fear
if
we
are
ever
to
rise
above
their
trickery
it
must
be
through
the
power
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
our
only
hope
as
the
scripture
tells
us
our
lord
has
not
given
us
the
spirit
of
fear
but
of
power
of
love
and
of
a
sound
mind
we
must
learn
to
wage
peace
as
our
lord
declared
long
ago
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
sons
of
god
until
next
month

rapes
however
some
states
such
as
illinois
are
not
tabluated
because
they
refuse
to
comply
with
this
sexist
definition

post
to

from
your
account
insofar
as
several
liberal
jurisdictions
are
concerned
the
essential
elements
of
rape
are
gender
neutral
nonetheless
i
decided
to
provide
a
number
of
references
to
support
my
original
argument
blacks
law
dictionary
every
law
studentlawyers
friend
defines
rape
as
unlawful
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
without
her
consent
the
unlawful
knowledge
of
a
woman
by
a
man
forcibly
and
against
her
will
the
model
penal
code
the
statute
proposed
by
the
national
conference
of
commissioners
of
uniform
state
laws
or
other
organization
for
adoption
by
state
legislatures
defines
rape
as
a
male
who
has
sexual
intercourse
with
a
female
not
his
wife
is
guilty
of
rape
if
he
a
compels
her
to
submit
by
force
or
by
threat
of
imminent
death

pm
pdt
q
i
had
two
questions
for
both
presidents
so
you
could
probably
answer
for
boris
too
laughter
the
president
ill
give
you
my
answer
then
ill
give
you
yeltsins
answer
laughter
q
the
first
is
that
this
is
the
meeting
of
the
presidents
so
the
money
thats
being
promised
is
government
money
and
naturally
its
going
to
be
distributed
through
the
government
but
youve
indicated
that
threequarters
are
going
to
be
going
to
businesses
so
the
question
is
how
the
russian
businesses
themselves
are
going
to
be
consulted
if
ever
what
are
the
priorities
because
there
are
several
association
of
russian
businessmen
existing
already
so
will
they
be
invited
to
participate
in
setting
up
priorities
for
investment
this
is
the
first
and
second
to
you
we
know
that
polls
public
polls
in
america
do
not
show
that
americans
are
very
enthusiastic
about
giving
this
aid
like
newsweek
polls
say
that
about
percent
dont
approve
it
and
new
york
times
published
that
percent
support
if
it
just
prevents
civil
war
percent
if
it
fosters
democratic
reform
and
only
percent
if
it
just
personally
supports
yeltsin
how
are
you
going
to
sort
of
handle
this
problem
that
americans
themselves
are
not
very
enthusiastic
thank
you
q
i
have
a
question
im
sorry
is
there
going
to
be
a
translation
of
everything
into
russian
no
just
the
answers
just
the
answers
okay
the
president
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
aid
were
discussing
for
example
the
funds
that
will
be
set
up
for
financing
new
businesses
will
obviously
go
to
those
businesses
who
apply
and
who
seem
to
be
good
risks
and
make
the
application
the
privatization
fund
will
be
used
to
support
the
privatization
of
existing
public
enterprises
then
there
are
some
other
general
funds
in
the
democracy
corps
and
other
things
which
people
in
russia
will
have
some
influence
over
the
distribution
of
with
regard
to
your
second
question
let
me
say
that
i
would
think
that
there
would
be
people
in
both
countries
who
would
not
feel
too
warmly
toward
simply
the
american
government
giving
money
to
the
russian
government
theres
opposition
to
that
in
russia
and
in
our
country
throughout
our
whole
history
there
has
been
an
opposition
to
foreign
aid
of
all
kinds
that
is
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
russia
if
you
look
at
the
whole
history
of
america
any
kind
of
aid
program
has
always
been
unpopular
what
i
have
tried
to
tell
the
american
people
is
is
this
is
not
an
aid
program
this
is
an
investment
program
that
this
is
an
investment
in
our
future
we
spent
trillion
trillion
on
armaments
on
soldiers
and
other
investments
because
of
the
cold
war
now
with
a
democratic
government
in
russia
with
the
newly
independent
states
the
remainder
of
them
working
on
a
democracy
and
struggling
to
get
their
economies
going
it
seems
to
me
very
much
in
our
interest
to
make
it
possible
to
do
whatever
we
can
for
democracy
to
survive
for
the
economy
of
russia
to
grow
because
of
the
potential
for
trade
and
investment
there
and
for
us
to
continue
the
effort
to
reduce
nuclear
weapons
and
other
elements
of
hostility
on
both
sides
on
our
side
and
on
the
russian
side
so
i
dont
see
this
as
an
aid
program
this
is
an
investment
for
the
united
states
this
is
very
much
in
the
interest
of
the
united
states
the
things
i
announced
today
the
second
stage
of
the
program
which
i
hope
to
put
together
next
week
in
my
view
are
things
that
are
good
for
my
country
and
for
the
taxpayers
and
workers
of
my
country
russia
is
a
very
great
nation
that
needs
some
partnership
now
some
common
endeavor
with
other
people
who
share
her
goals
but
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
for
anyone
to
view
this
as
some
sort
of
just
a
charity
or
an
aid
issue
thats
not
what
it
is
its
an
investment
for
america
and
its
a
wonderful
investment
like
all
investments
there
is
some
risk
but
theres
far
less
risk
with
a
far
greater
potential
of
return
than
the
trillion
we
spent
looking
at
each
other
across
the
barrier
of
the
cold
war
q
mr
president
first
of
all
thank
you
very
much
indeed
for
coming
here
and
talking
to
us
in
the
memory
of
the
living
correspondents
this
is
the
first
time
an
american
president
is
doing
this
to
the
russian
press
corps
so
its
kind
of
a
very
measured
breakthrough
i
have
two
questions
one
in
your
introductory
remarks
of
the
other
press
conference
you
mentioned
in
brief
that
you
discussed
the
start
ii
and
start
i
issues
could
you
tell
us
did
you
reach
an
agreement
with
president
yeltsin
as
to
what
might
be
done
in
order
to
have
ukraine
join
the
ratification
of
start
i
and
the
npt
regime
and
my
second
question
is
how
confident
you
are
that
the
united
states
congress
would
be
eager
to
support
you
in
lifting
jacksonvanik
and
other
restrictions
inherited
from
the
cold
war
president
clinton
first
we
discussed
the
issue
of
ukraine
with
regard
to
start
i
and
npt
and
generally
with
regard
to
the
need
to
proceed
to
have
the
other
independent
states
all
be
nonnuclear
but
also
to
have
the
united
states
develop
strong
relationships
with
them
we
know
that
one
thing
that
we
could
do
that
would
increase
i
think
the
willingness
of
the
ukraine
to
support
this
direction
is
to
successfully
conclude
our
own
negotiations
on
highly
enriched
uranium
because
that
would
provide
not
only
an
important
economic
opportunity
for
russia
but
also
for
ukraine
and
it
would
show
some
reaching
out
on
our
part
but
we
agreed
that
basically
the
people
who
signed
off
on
the
lisbon
protocol
have
got
to
honor
what
they
did
and
we
agreed
to
continue
to
press
that
i
myself
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
trying
to
reassure
ukraines
leaders
specifically
the
president
and
the
foreign
minister
that
i
want
strong
ties
with
ukraine
that
the
united
states
very
much
wants
a
good
relationship
with
ukraine
but
that
in
order
to
do
what
we
need
to
do
together
to
strengthen
the
economy
of
ukraine
and
to
have
the
united
states
be
fully
supportive
the
commitment
to
ratify
start
i
and
to
join
the
npt
regime
is
critical
what
was
the
second
question
the
president
with
regard
to
jacksonvanik
and
cocom
i
would
make
two
points
first
i
have
agreed
with
the
republican
and
democratic
leaders
in
the
congress
that
we
will
as
soon
as
i
return
have
a
list
of
all
the
legislative
and
other
restrictions
some
of
them
are
regulatory
in
nature
imposed
on
relations
between
the
united
states
and
russia
that
are
legacies
of
the
cold
war
and
we
will
see
whether
theyre
how
many
of
them
we
could
agree
to
do
away
with
right
now
at
least
among
the
leadership
of
the
congress
with
regard
to
jacksonvanik
i
think
there
will
be
an
openness
to
change
the
law
if
the
congress
is
convinced
there
are
in
fact
no
more
refusniks
no
more
people
who
wish
to
emigrate
who
are
not
being
allowed
to
if
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
one
there
who
would
have
been
who
the
law
was
designed
to
affect
then
i
think
that
the
desire
to
keep
the
law
will
be
much
less
with
regard
to
cocom
my
guess
is
and
its
nothing
more
than
a
guess
that
the
leadership
of
congress
and
indeed
my
own
advisers
might
prefer
to
see
some
sort
of
phased
movement
out
of
the
cocom
regime
but
i
think
they
would
be
willing
to
begin
it
in
the
fairly
near
future
q
mr
clinton
when
i
read
your
speech
in
annapolis
i
got
the
impression
that
you
have
a
completely
different
personal
and
i
stress
that
personal
not
political
approach
towards
russia
compared
to
the
approach
of
mr
bush
could
you
formulate
in
a
few
words
what
is
the
difference
between
you
as
a
personality
and
your
approach
the
difference
between
your
approach
to
russia
and
the
approach
of
mr
bush
and
who
made
you
why
did
you
cite
akhmatova
in
the
last
part
of
your
speech
the
president
let
me
say
first
i
do
not
wish
to
compare
myself
with
president
bush
or
anyone
else
i
cant
say
what
was
in
his
heart
about
russia
i
can
say
that
since
i
was
a
boy
i
have
been
personally
fascinated
with
the
history
the
music
and
the
culture
and
the
literature
of
russia
i
have
been
thrilled
by
russian
music
since
i
was
a
serious
student
of
music
for
more
than
years
now
i
have
read
major
russian
novelists
and
many
of
your
poets
and
followed
your
ballet
and
tried
to
know
as
much
as
i
could
about
your
history
and
i
went
to
the
soviet
union
but
it
was
then
the
soviet
union
you
may
know
it
was
a
big
issue
in
the
last
presidential
campaign
that
i
spent
the
first
week
of
alone
in
moscow
and
did
not
return
again
until
three
days
before
mr
yeltsin
was
elected
president
but
all
that
time
i
was
away
i
was
following
events
there
very
closely
and
hoping
for
the
day
when
we
could
be
genuine
partners
so
i
have
always
had
a
personal
feeling
about
russia
i
remember
for
example
a
lot
of
you
know
i
like
music
very
much
one
of
the
most
moving
experiences
for
me
as
a
musician
was
when
leonard
bernstein
took
the
new
york
philharmonic
to
moscow
and
played
shostakovichs
fifth
symphony
to
the
russians
and
he
played
the
last
movement
more
rapidly
than
anyone
had
ever
played
it
before
because
it
was
technically
so
difficult
that
is
something
i
followed
very
closely
when
it
occurred
these
are
things
that
have
always
had
a
big
impact
on
my
life
and
i
had
just
always
hoped
that
someday
if
i
ever
had
the
chance
to
i
could
play
a
role
in
seeing
our
two
countries
become
closer
partners

white

as

white

invented
those
things
which
means
nothing
to
white
males
as
a

you
neglected

charles

hitler
mccarthy
jack
the
ripper
ted

and
a

can
take

boons
we
must
also
take
the
blame
for
our
fellows
blights
i
claim
we
deserve
neither
credit
nor
blame
for
these
things
white
males
need
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
theyre
being
unfair
yes
but
everyone
else
needs
to
wake
up
and
realize
that
being
unfair
right
back
is
disgusting
racist
and
sexist
why
cant
we
learn
to
treat
everyone
fairly
without
generalizing
what
stupidity
gene
makes
this
so
difficult
id
like
to
buy
the
world
a
clue
the
word
that
is
missing
in
this
whole
discourse
is
not
the
b
word
or
the
h
word
or
even
the
n
or
w
words
it
is
the
l
word
loser
thats
right
when
we
boil
all
the
crap
out
of
this
argument
it
is
all
about
winning
and
losing
and
nothing
else
let
me
explain
in
the
meantime
there
is
guilt
for
winning
maybe
a
fear
that
one
doesnt
deserve
ones
bounty
or
success
so
there
is
a
kinder
and
gentler
type
of
politician
these
days
bill
clinton
affirmative
action
and
lots
of
discourse
about
people
who
dont
get
it
for
those
of
us
in
the
winning
business
this
kind
of
talk
is
mildly
irritating
but
there
is
still
no
suggestion
of
losing
who
is
dfens
anyway
the
answer
is
as
plain
as
the
horn
rims
on
your
face
the
guy
is
michael
douglas
posing
as
a
loser
this
is
known
as
controversial
casting
but
that
baggy
shortsleeved
white
shirt
sure
does
look
natural
on
mike
doesnt
it
gordon
gekko
will
never
look
the
same
though
woody
always
dressed
that
way
did
we
really
expect
gekko
to
take
it
easy
and
enjoy
that
kind
of
wardrobe
without
putting
up
a
fuss
what
we
are
starting
to
lose
sight
of
is
that
bashing
dfens
is
the
same
game
as
bashing
that
poor
african
american
slug
that
clint
eastwood
used
to
blow
away
all
the
time
as
that
archwasp
male
gender
george
c
scott
declaimed
americans
traditionally
love
to
win
they
love
a
winner
and
will
not
tolerate
a
loser
and
so
on
since
we
are
talking
in
theory
and
opinion
then
ill
put
in
my
first
a
rebuttle
personally
i
love
underdogs
unlike
bandwagon
jumpers
i
abandon
teams
when
they
start
winning
people
that
cheer
for
winners
just
because
they
are
winners
are
insecure
people
who
are
afraid
to
be
associated
with
something
negative
the
political
implications
are
simple
if
as
many
socialists
and
democrats
do
you
consider
society
a
finite
pie
to
a
apportioned
in
some
equitable
way
then
you
have
to
worry
about
who
is
a
winner
and
who
is
a
loser
to
tell
whose
side
you
are
on
that
could
be
black
women
today
asian
homosexuals
tommorrow
and
yes
indeed
white
men
some
yet
to
be
determined
day
when
the
balance
of
the
pie
has
finally
swung
against
that
minority
on
this
one
point
i
agree
the
reason
that
people
bash
wasps
is
because
they
have
been
on
top
for
a
long
time
whoever
is
on
top
is
going
to
oppress
whoever
is
below
them
so
that
they
can
stay
on
top
if
hannibal
had
pushed
on
to
rome
after
his
victory
at
cannae
we
might
all
be
bashing
the
blacks
for
oppressing
us
peacefull
white
people
for
all
these
centuries
i
seriously
doubt
that
if
the
blacks
had
conquered
the
world
that
they
would
have
treated
their
colonies
any
betterworse
than
the
whites
did
the
white
race
did
some
unspeakable
things
to
the
other
races
of
the
world
but
they
only
did
what
any
other
conquering
race
would
have
done
ie
khan
the
real
question
is
should
we
carry
over
that
blame
to
the
present
generation
who
didnt
participate
in
the
crimes
would
it
do
any
good
has
it
done
bosnia
any
good
they
are
fighting
wars
that
stopped
hundreds
even
thousands
of
years
ago
my
opinion
is
if
there
are
inequities
now
then
lets
change
them
but
dont
blame
me
for
what
my
ancestors
did
it
wouldnt
settle
anything
anyway
either
way
you
go
the
way
of
the
winner
is
no
longer
the
way
to
be
popular
at
least
after
you
graduate
from
high
school
but
youll
still
be
popular
at
high
school
reunions
but
it
beats
being
a
nerd
as
i
would
imagine
michael
douglas
would
now
agree
and
in
the
long
run
it
is
the
only
way
to
go
thats
where
you
are
dead
wrong
you
dont
join
up
on
a
side
just
because
they
are
winning
that
makes
you
spineless
winning
in
high
school
and
after
high
school
is
still
the
best
way
to
be
popular
but
it
doesnt
make
you
right
all
the
best
causes
in
history
were
loosing
causes
with
only
a
couple
exceptions
winning
only
makes
a
difference
to
other
people
not
to
yourself
and
what
good
is
the
opinions
of
other
people
if
they
only
care
how
you
appear
ie
a
winner
if
you
cant
beat
them
fight
them

inch

the

the

am
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
president
is
soon
to
be
on
his
way
on
amtrack
to
camden
yards
hell
be
throwing
out
the
first
pitch
q
its
marc
the
maryland
area
transit
its
not

mr
stephanopoulos
oh
its
not
amtrack
well
hes
going
from
union
station
youre
right
excuse
me
q
george
what
exactly
are
you
prepared
to
do
to
break
the
logjam
with
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
well
as
you
know
there
are
discussions
between
senator
mitchell
and
senator
dole
this
morning
and
i
think
that
the
president
is
going
to
continue
to
make
the
point
that
he
believes
that
our
investment
package
our
jobs
package
needs
to
be
passed
as
quickly
as
possible
we
need
this
investment
for
summer
jobs
for
immunization
for
highway
construction
for
the
important
programs
that
will
put
people
back
to
work
right
away
this
summer
and
the
president
continues
to
believe
his
program
should
be
passed
q
will
he
compromise
thats
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
well
as
you
know
the
discussions
are
going
on
this
morning
in
the
senate
betwen
senator
mitchell
and
senator
dole
lets
see
what
they
come
up
with
but
the
president
believes
his
jobs
program
should
go
forward
q
george
would
the
president
be
willing
to
accept
billion
for
one
year
which
apparently
appears
to
be
the
compromise
being
offered
by
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
what
is
being
offered
by
either
side
the
senate
discussions
are
going
on
right
now
lets
see
what
happens
today
q
would
he
go
that
far
no
matter
what
the
republicans
have
offered
so
far
would
he
go
that
far
billion
per
year
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
his
program
should
be
passed
at
this
time
clearly
were
going
to
be
willing
to
listen
to
what
the
senators
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
come
up
with
but
im
not
going
to
get
into
figures
right
now
lets
see
what
happens
q
its
reasonable
to
assume
isnt
it
from
what
has
happened
so
far
that
a
compromise
is
going
to
be
necessary
in
order
to
get
a
vote
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
seem
more
intrested
in
stopping
progress
on
the
presidents
jobs
bill
than
in
doing
something
to
create
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
seem
more
interested
in
stopping
progress
on
the
presidents
jobs
bill
than
in
doing
something
to
create
real
action
real
jobs
this
summer
for
the
american
people
i
think
theres
no
question
about
that
theres
been
some
frustration
of
legislative
activity
over
the
last
few
days
q
so
youll
need
to
compromise
to
get
your
package
through
mr
stephanopoulos
well
see
what
happens
with
the
conversations
between
senator
mitchell
and
senator
dole
this
morning
q
prepared
to
compromise
mr
stephanopoulos
the
presidents
prepared
to
listen
to
what
senator
mitchell
has
to
say
this
morning
after
his
meeting
with
senator
dole
q
does
he
feel
that
he
has
been
defeated
in
his
mr
stephanopoulos
not
in
the
least
in
fact
hes
been
very
successful
so
far
in
the
beginning
of
his
term
q
how
mr
stephanopoulos
he
passed
his
budget
in
record
time
in
six
weeks
and
its
a
budget
which
reduces
the
deficit
by
billion
over
five
years
and
its
a
budget
which
provides
for
important
investments
in
our
future
right
now
weve
also
had
strong
passage
of
his
jobs
program
through
the
house
simply
because
a
minority
of
republicans
in
the
senate
choose
to
perpetuate
gridlock
and
hold
up
action
on
the
presidents
jobs
program
is
not
a
sign
that
he
is
not
succeeding
overall
q
he
cant
beat
this
can
he
q
the
fact
is
they
can
do
that
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
republicans
can
stop
action
theres
no
question
about
that
q
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
q
george
what
do
you
know
about
these
alleged
notes
taken
by
boris
yeltsin
during
one
of
the
meetings
in
which
it
appears
that
the
president
told
boris
yeltsin
not
to
trust
the
japanese
that
when
they
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
a
complete
misreading
of
what
happened
at
the
meeting
the
context
of
the
conversation
was
that
president
clinton
was
actually
reassuring
president
yeltsin
at
the
time
about
his
conversations
with
prime
minister
miyazawa
over
the
kuril
islands
and
the
prime
ministers
belief
that
japan
would
play
a
constructive
role
in
the
process
i
mean
this
was
a
casual
comment
about
japanese
courtesy
and
etiquette
but
overall
it
was
in
the
context
of
a
conversation
where
he
was
reassuring
president
yeltsin
that
he
believed
the
japanese
were
serious
about
their
commitment
to
the
process
q
are
you
saying
that
the
president
said
that
when
the
japanese
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
not
i
dont
know
the
exact
words
and
there
was
a
much
longer
discussion
about
he
did
say
something
along
the
lines
that
he
believes
that
on
this
issue
prime
minister
miyazawa
intends
to
really
go
forward
with
the
process
q
have
there
been
any
attempts
to
explain
this
to
the
japanese
because
apparently
the
japanese
press
has
picked
this
up
and
there
appears
to
be
mr
stephanopoulos
ive
seen
the
reports
in
the
japanese
press
and
it
actually
does
put
the
situation
in
context
it
does
talk
about
the
japanese
understanding
the
japanese
points
of
view
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
a
problem
i
believe
that
there
may
have
been
some
diplomatic
context
just
to
clear
things
up
but
im
not
positive
q
george
was
the
specific
comment
that
was
made
specific
to
the
kuril
island
situation
or
was
it
a
general
observation
on
japanese
etiquette
mr
stephanopoulos
the
discussion
was
about
q
the
specific
comment
is
what
im
asking
about
that
has
alleged
to
have
been
translated
from
the
russian
notes
when
the
japanese
say
yes
they
mean
no
mr
stephanopoulos
well
it
was
a
combination
i
mean
i
dont
think
thats
the
whole
sentence
i
think
that
the
specific
comment
was
a
broad
general
observation
followed
up
by
a
specific
finish
to
the
sentence
where
he
said
in
this
case
he
believes
that
prime
minister
miyazawa
means
to
keep
the
commitment
q
was
he
saying
it
facetiously
first
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
just
a
casual
observation
q
and
then
you
say
diplomatic
contacts
were
made
to
clear
it
up
has
the
president
sent
a
message
mr
stephanopoulos
no
i
dont
think
the
president
spoke
i
believe
that
secretary
christopher
has
made
some
calls
but
im
not
sure
exactly
how
many
q
well
this
obviously
is
a
bigger
deal
than
youre
making
it
out
to
be
if
christopher
has
had
to
make
some
calls
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
it
was
just
that
we
got
the
reports
in
vancouver
and
the
secretary
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
understood
and
make
sure
there
was
absolutely
no
mr
stephanopoulos
reports
in
vancouver
and
the
secretary
wanted
to
make
sure
that
it
was
understood
and
make
sure
there
is
absolutely
no
misunderstanding
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
on
q
what
is
our
position
about
the
japanese
that
they
may
have
to
say
one
thing
but
actualy
mean
another
mr
stephanopoulos
no
the
position
on
the
japanese
is
as
the
president
stated
to
president
yeltsin
throughout
the
two
days
he
said
that
he
had
had
a
good
conversation
with
prime
minister
miazawa
prior
to
the
summit
he
reiterated
the
us
position
the
longstanding
support
for
the
japanese
position
on
the
kuril
islands
but
also
reiterated
prime
minister
miazawas
commitment
to
move
forward
on
the
process
and
to
play
a
constructive
role
and
i
think
president
yeltsin
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
q
after
listening
to
secretary
christopher
on
iraq
for
the
last
few
days
im
a
little
confused
what
is
the
us
policy
do
you
want
to
see
saddam
hussein
overturned
mr
stephanopoulos
its
the
same
policy
that
secretary
christopher
has
reiterated
and
all
of
the
us
officials
have
reiterated
we
expect
full
and
complete
and
unequivocal
compliance
with
all
un
resolutions
right
now
we
do
not
have
that
compliance
q
throwing
it
out
further
that
if
iraq
complies
saddam
cant
stay
in
office
mr
stephanopoulos
right
i
think
that
thats
our
judgment
is
that
it
is
not
possible
for
saddam
hussein
to
comply
with
the
resolutions
and
stay
in
power
but
the
important
point
is
that
we
expect
compliance
by
iraq
with
all
un
resolutions
and
we
will
continue
to
demand
it
q
and
are
you
concerned
the
iran
will
become
the
dominant
power
in
the
area
mr
stephanopoulos
secretary
christopher
has
also
spoken
to
iran
over
the
last
several
days
and
he
says
we
also
expect
full
iranian
compliance
with
all
international
norms
and
stopping
support
of
terrorism
q
thats
a
very
glib
statement
that
he
wont
stay
in
power
if
he
complies
with
un
resolutions
on
what
logic
do
you
base
that
mr
stephanopoulos
right
now
saddam
hussein
is
not
complying
with
the
un
resolutions
at
all
he
is
not
respecting
the
rights
of
his
people
as
is
required
by
the
un
resolution
he
is
not
fully
complying
with
all
the
resolutions
regarding
inspections
he
is
not
fully
complying
with
all
the
resolutions
regarding
armaments
q
well
when
do
you
think
that
if
he
did
comply
he
would
be
out
of
power
mr
stephanopoulos
well
right
now
his
power
rests
on
the
repression
of
his
people
if
he
stopped
doing
that
it
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
him
to
stay
in
power
q
george
back
on
the
stimulus
package
why
is
it
that
you
and
the
president
accuse
the
republicans
of
playing
pure
politics
and
perpetuating
gridlock
why
is
it
that
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
they
just
dont
have
a
genuine
idealogical
difference
with
you
thats
in
good
faith
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
fact
that
several
times
in
the
past
the
republicans
many
of
the
ones
who
are
now
leading
the
fight
for
the
filibuster
have
supported
the
very
funding
they
now
seek
to
stop
most
especially
the
highway
funding
q
george
in
regards
to
that
some
of
the
moderate
republicans
said
that
the
white
house
erred
by
not
being
more
open
to
them
during
the
while
the
plan
was
put
together
that
they
had
one
sort
of
proforma
meeting
between
the
white
house
and
the
senate
republicans
and
that
was
it
does
the
administration
look
back
and
thinks
perhaps
it
could
have
done
a
better
job
of
working
with
some
mr
stephanopoulos
well
im
not
sure
that
its
true
that
there
was
only
one
meeting
i
mean
the
president
met
with
the
republican
leadership
on
at
least
two
occasions
before
the
introduction
of
his
package
he
met
with
the
entire
senate
republican
caucus
also
for
lunch
and
went
up
there
we
are
continually
in
contact
with
as
many
republicans
as
we
can
find
who
have
an
interest
in
the
presidents
package
we
are
interested
in
what
they
have
to
say
as
well
but
we
believe
that
this
program
is
important
and
were
going
to
continue
to
fight
for
it
q
your
all
or
nothing
do
it
with
the
democrats
alone
strategy
did
you
maybe
miscalculate
the
ability
to
get
it
through
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
under
the
senate
rules
a
determined
minority
can
frustrate
activity
i
mean
there
is
just
no
question
about
that
you
only
need
plus
one
to
keep
going
plus
one
to
keep
going
and
to
stop
any
action
and
thats
what
the
republicans
are
doing
q
going
to
rethink
the
way
you
attempt
to
get
other
things
passed
as
you
go
through
this
process
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
q
work
with
republicans
and
try
to
woo
some
republicans
into
your
camp
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
were
going
to
continue
to
look
for
the
support
of
republicans
whenever
we
can
get
it
on
the
presidents
intiatives
q
but
on
this
one
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
differently
than
you
did
it
on
this
one
because
on
this
one
you
really
did
stiff
the
republicans
from
the
beginning
and
made
it
clear
that
it
was
a
democratic
majority
that
would
get
this
through
and
could
get
it
through
and
you
really
didnt
need
republican
votes
are
you
going
to
take
a
different
tack
when
you
have
to
go
for
particular
votes
when
you
have
to
go
through
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
see
into
the
future
and
understand
every
possible
turn
in
the
legislative
road
clearly
the
presidents
going
to
continue
to
reach
out
when
he
can
q
you
dont
have
any
regrets
then
about
the
way
you
have
handled
it
up
to
now
and
you
dont
plan
any
changes
in
your
approach
in
dealing
with
the
republicans
in
congress
based
on
this
experience
mr
stephanopoulos
obviously
the
president
would
like
his
package
passed
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hes
going
to
continue
to
press
for
that
we
will
continue
to
reach
out
to
republicans
theres
not
question
about
that
and
well
continue
to
reason
with
them
and
try
and
find
appropriate
avenues
for
cooperation
in
this
case
the
republicans
have
chosen
to
unify
around
a
filibuster
around
a
plan
to
frustrate
action
not
a
plan
to
move
forward
q
theyre
being
denied
any
other
legislative
means
of
putting
their
proposals
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theyre
being
q
any
ideas
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
their
amendments
are
being
defeated
i
dont
know
that
theyre
being
denied
q
to
present
them
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
not
exactly
true
i
mean
they
get
the
votes
q
that
theirs
can
be
passed
though
by
the
parliamentary
rules
under
which
theyre
playing
mr
stephanopoulos
unless
they
get
a
majority
in
support
all
the
way
around
no
thats
not
exactly
true
q
george
one
more
on
iraq
is
the
administration
backing
any
of
the
iraqi
opposition
grooming
any
new
leadership
q
backing
any
of
the
iraqi
leadership
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
i
again
were
pressing
for
iraqi
compliance
i
dont
know
if
we
can
get
into
the
business
of
grooming
leadership
i
believe
there
have
been
some
contacts
at
some
levels
with
iraqi
opposition
groups
i
dont
know
about
anything
recently
q
jesse
jackson
who
of
course
is
not
the
presidents
best
friend
has
however
been
told
that
there
is
to
be
some
kind
of
town
meeting
or
some
kind
of
involvement
by
the
president
preempted
the
ball
game
los
angeles
will
he
consider
something
like
that
or
any
other
kind
of
intervention
there
mr
stephanopoulos
well
as
you
know
the
president
appointed
commerce
secretary
ron
brown
about
days
ago
to
be
a
special
envoy
to
california
and
coordiante
cabinet
activities
around
the
california
economic
situation
including
the
situation
in
los
angeles
i
believe
there
will
also
be
visits
out
to
los
angeles
by
the
education
or
have
been
visits
by
the
education
secretary
mr
riley
i
believe
that
transportation
secretary
pena
and
hud
secretary
cisneros
are
also
going
out
and
there
may
be
other
visits
by
cabinet
officials
over
the
next
several
days
and
weeks
i
wouldnt
rule
out
the
possibility
of
a
visit
by
president
clinton
to
california
obviously
he
is
following
the
situation
closely
and
is
concerned
about
making
sure
that
we
make
the
right
long
term
policy
decisions
that
will
help
create
the
kind
of
economic
opportunities
which
help
prevent
disturbances
but
were
going
to
continue
to
watch
it
q
george
as
a
followup
reverend
jackson
is
also
supposed
to
be
outside
the
ball
park
today
in
baltimore
with
a
group
of
supporters
protesting
the
lack
of
minorities
in
baseball
management
does
the
president
have
a
position
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
received
correspondence
from
reverend
jackson
i
know
that
reverend
jackson
has
also
spoken
with
the
white
house
chief
of
staff
mack
mclarty
he
clearly
raises
serious
questions
there
has
been
some
progress
in
baseball
over
the
last
several
years
but
still
not
enough
but
the
president
intends
to
continue
to
go
to
the
ball
game
q
is
he
going
to
say
anything
about
it
today
or
see
reverend
jackson
while
hes
out
there
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
he
is
going
to
see
them
but
as
i
said
the
president
believes
that
reverend
jackson
has
raised
some
serious
questions
and
its
something
that
as
i
said
even
though
there
has
been
progress
its
clearly
not
enough
q
did
reverend
jackson
ask
him
not
to
go
to
the
ball
game
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
about
that
i
believe
the
characterization
the
reverend
jackson
is
talking
about
is
an
informational
pickett
i
dont
know
that
he
asked
him
not
to
go
to
the
ball
game
but
he
sent
a
long
detailed
formal
letter
outlining
his
concerns
with
the
situation
in
major
league
baseball
and
the
president
read
it
q
george
the
orioles
are
playing
the
rangers
the
managing
partner
of
the
rangers
is
george
w
bush
is
he
going
to
be
there
and
is
he
going
to
meet
with
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
q
what
is
the
mubarak
schedule
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
that
president
mubarak
is
coming
tomorrow
morning
for
a
working
meeting
they
will
have
a
lunch
and
i
believe
that
he
is
having
dinner
tonight
with
vice
president
gore
q
and
joint
statements
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
so
yes
at
the
end
yes
q
is
there
evidence
george
that
the
egyptians
did
warn
the
us
about
a
potential
terrorist
bombing
terrorist
activities
mr
stephanopoulos
as
reported
in
the
new
york
times
i
mean
i
think
that
president
mubarak
did
say
that
there
has
been
general
conversations
with
the
egyptians
as
there
have
been
for
a
long
period
of
time
we
do
have
general
intelligence
sharing
i
mean
but
president
mubarak
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
specific
information
on
this
visit
that
was
passed
forward
the
president
will
continue
to
investigate
the
situation
but
he
also
reiterates
his
belief
that
we
cannot
tolerate
terrorism
of
any
kind
q
george
he
did
make
specific
or
the
egyptians
apparently
did
issue
specific
warnings
about
this
individual
who
forgive
me
this
individual
who
forgive
me
the
name
escapes
me
at
the
moment
and
said
the
egyptians
were
more
or
less
rebuffed
in
their
attempts
to
get
some
kind
of
action
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
if
i
would
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
mubarak
interview
he
did
say
that
they
gave
general
warnings
about
the
possibility
of
a
network
in
the
united
states
and
upon
which
we
took
appropriate
action
but
there
was
no
specific
information
on
this
specific
operation
at
all
q
so
the
white
house
doesnt
feel
that
any
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
whether
it
be
the
cia
or
fbi
who
would
have
received
this
kind
of
information
was
lax
or
derelict
in
its
duty
in
not
pursuing
some
kind
of
mr
stephanopoulos
no
not
at
all
q
whats
next
with
serbia
it
got
only
a
passing
mention
in
the
news
conference
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
you
didnt
get
to
ask
your
question
q
yes
exactly
was
there
any
agreement
on
concerted
action
between
the
two
countries
and
even
if
there
wasnt
what
does
the
us
do
next
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
us
is
clearly
going
to
move
forward
in
the
un
today
continuing
discussions
with
our
allies
on
a
sanctions
resolution
and
well
continue
to
look
for
ways
to
press
the
serbians
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
and
sign
an
agreement
q
george
why
do
you
think
sanctions
is
still
an
option
i
mean
the
serbians
make
it
clear
that
at
least
the
leadership
is
surviving
just
fine
and
they
feel
like
they
can
wait
you
out
and
even
the
administration
officials
we
had
in
the
other
day
said
theres
no
evidence
that
theyre
going
to
have
an
effect
any
time
soon
the
bosnian
serbs
have
said
no
to
the
peace
plan
when
does
no
mean
no
and
you
have
to
do
something
different
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
we
are
doing
something
different
were
moving
forward
on
further
sanctions
through
the
un
and
those
discussions
will
continue
were
going
to
continue
to
try
and
tighten
the
noose
on
serbia
and
i
think
that
every
opportunity
we
have
to
do
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
q
are
we
looking
again
at
lifting
the
arms
embargo
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
said
that
this
is
something
that
is
under
consideration
q
george
do
you
have
any
more
on
hugh
rodhams
condition
how
hes
doing
mr
stephanopoulos
as
far
as
i
know
nothings
changed
q
george
week
after
mr
mubarak
mr
stephanopoulos
its
a
little
unclear
i
think
well
be
able
to
get
you
more
either
tonight
or
tomorrow
morning
after
the
mubarak
visit
q
is
he
going
somewhere
for
easter
mr
stephanopoulos
not
that
i
know
of
q
what
more
can
you
tell
us
about
the
additional
aid
to
russia
that
the
president
plans
to
ask
congress
about
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
going
to
be
consulting
with
the
congress
and
with
our
partners
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
i
know
that
he
spoke
last
evening
with
congressman
gephardt
and
their
delegation
before
the
the
congressional
delegation
meets
with
the
russians
this
week
and
those
consultations
will
continue
over
the
next
several
weeks
q
do
you
expect
that
package
to
be
of
the
magnitude
of
the
one
announced
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
going
to
discuss
the
magnitude
q
how
about
the
list
of
cold
war
restrictions
where
do
you
stand
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
as
the
president
said
yesterday
hes
going
to
be
looking
for
that
list
from
the
congress
this
week
and
reviewing
it
he
believes
hes
going
to
try
and
get
it
this
week
and
hes
going
to
review
the
list
and
were
going
to
take
a
hard
look
at
it
q
but
theyre
making
it
up
i
mean
its
no
white
house
involvement
congress
is
compiling
this
list
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
hes
going
to
talk
to
the
congressional
leaders
about
compiling
the
list
but
im
certain
well
be
able
to
get
our
own
researchers
working
as
well
q
george
isnt
lifting
the
arms
embargo
more
of
a
probability
than
a
possibility
mr
stephanopoulos
its
something
thats
under
discussion
q
secretary
christopher
has
said
that
its
a
matter
of
time
and
for
months
before
that
happens
mr
stephanopoulos
again
all
i
can
say
is
that
its
something
that
the
president
is
reviewing
right
now
were
working
with
our
allies
in
the
un
on
a
sanctions
resolution
and
well
continue
to
review
other
matters
q
george
can
you
tell
us
anything
about
the
schedule
this
week
any
travel
mr
stephanopoulos
they
just
asked
about
that
i
dont
have
anything
more
beyond
tomorrows
visit
with
mubarak
right
now
q
are
there
consultations
george
with
any
jewish
american
organizations
concerning
jacksonvanick
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
national
conference
of
soviet
jewry
has
a
list
of
i
believe
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
national
conference
of
soviet
jewry
has
a
list
of
i
believe
refuseniks
well
certainly
take
a
look
at
that
and
continue
appropriate
discussions

q
mr
president
what
do
you
think
of
jesse
jacksons
protest
today
the
president
i
think
its
an
informational
protest
i
think
its
fine
the
owners
put
out
a
statement
few
days
ago
which
they
say
was
the
first
step
in
you
know
efforts
to
increase
minority
ownership
and
minority
increases
in
management
i
think
we
should
im
encouraged
by
don
baylors
appointment
out
in
colorado
and
i
think
its
time
to
make
a
move
on
that
front
so
i
think
its
a
legitimate
issue
and
i
think
its
like
i
said
its
an
informational
picket
and
not
an
attempt
to
get
people
not
to
go
to
the
game
so
i
think
its
good
q
do
you
think
theyre
moving
fast
enough
the
president
well
i
think
that
it
was
a
good
first
step
and
i
think
youll
see
some
movement
now
and
i
think
its
an
issue
that
deserves
some
attention
and
theyre
obviously
going
to
give
it
some
and
i
think
that
reverend
jackson
being
out
there
will
highlight
the
issue
so
i
think
its
fine
q
mr
president
how
about
the
logjam
in
the
senate
on
the
economic
stimulus
plan
do
you
think
theyll
be
able
to
break
that
and
get
cloture
the
president
i
dont
know
were
working
at
it
i
mean
its
a
classic
there
was
an
article
in
the
paper
today
one
of
the
papers
i
saw
which
pretty
well
summed
it
up
they
said
you
know
this
is
a
its
just
a
political
power
play
in
the
senate
the
majority
does
not
rule
its
not
like
the
country
its
not
like
the
its
not
like
the
house
if
the
minority
chooses
they
can
stop
majority
rule
and
thats
what
theyre
doing
there
are
a
lot
of
republican
senators
who
have
told
people
that
they
might
vote
for
the
stimulus
program
but
theres
enormous
partisan
political
pressure
not
to
do
it
and
of
course
what
it
means
is
that
in
this
time
when
no
new
jobs
are
being
created
even
though
there
seems
to
be
an
economic
recovery
it
means
that
for
political
purposes
theyre
willing
to
deny
jobs
to
places
like
baltimore
and
dallas
and
houston
and
pittsburgh
and
philadelphia
and
portland
and
seattle
its
very
sad
i
mean
the
block
grant
program
was
designed
to
create
jobs
in
a
hurry
based
on
local
priorities
and
its
one
that
the
republicans
had
always
championed
just
about
the
only
democrat
champions
of
the
program
were
people
like
me
who
were
out
there
at
the
grassroots
level
governors
and
senators
i
just
think
its
real
sad
that
they
have
chosen
to
exert
the
minority
muscle
in
a
way
that
will
keep
americans
out
of
work
i
think
its
a
mistake

press

sort

misses

doesnt

it

whichever

clayton
says
you
are
incorrect
the
most
recent
survey
data
i
can
find
shows
that
of
molestation
is
exclusively
homosexuals
is
bisexual
victims
are
both
male
and
female
and
the
remainder
is
exclusively
heterosexual
so
what
you
are
saying
is
that
of
the
child
molestations
are
committed
by
heterosexuals
i
cannot
see
the
correlation
you
cite
bisexuals
are
heterosexuals
since
when
which
concludes
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
molest
children
or
that
by
being
homosexual
you
will
have
the
propensity
for
molesting
children
i
havent
said
that
homosexual
child
molester
simply
that
is
more
likely
if
of
the
molestations
are
by
homosexuals
why
are
you
so
concerned
about
creating
a
relation
between
the
two
if
you
had
evidence
that
of
the
molestations
are
committed
by
homosexuals
you
might
find
a
relationship
ok
where
is
the
realtionship
you
make
the
one
that
is

when
nambla

also
what
is
the
reason
people
molest
from
human
sexuality
and
a
psych
class
or
too
i
have
taken
the
overwhelming
voice
says
that
people
commit
these
acts
as
power
trips
and
to
feel
in
control
this
has
nothing
to

you

that
this

argument
could
be
applied
to
a
woman
who
decided
she
wanted
an
abortion
because
she
was
having
a
bad
hair
day
as
you
well
know
the
facts
are
that
there
are
about
thirdtrimester
abortions
performed
in
this
country
annually
and
those
are
only
done

hmmm
human
gestation
period
is
something
like
weeks
that
means
third
trimester
abortions
are
those
done
after
weeks
in
consulting
a
world
almanac
i
see
that
of
abortions
in
were
done
at
weeks
or
more
thats
about
abortions
in
after
weeks
unless
the
number
of
abortions
performed
has
dropped
dramatically
or
a
lot
of
abortions
are
done
between
and
weeks
i
think
you
are
wrong
by
the
way
roe
v
wade
allowed
states
to
adopt
very
very
broad
prohibitions
on
thirdtrimester
abortions
but
some
states
such
as
california
declined
to
do
so
it
was
reported
that
what
finally
stopped
third
trimester
elective
abortions
in
the
bay
area
wasnt
law
but
that
the
only
hospital
doing
them
ran
out
of
nurses
then
doctors
willing
to
do
them
not
surprisingly
the
bay
area
now
chapter
was
terribly
upset
about
this
i
remain
prochoice
but
when
prochoicers
compare
abortion
in
a
clinic
to
a
religious
ritual
in
a
church
you
have
to
start
wondering
a
bit
if
the
prolife
criticism
of
abortion
as
modern
human
sacrifice
doesnt
have
a
grain
of
truth

it

your

a

does
not

out
in

to

either
but
a

is

there
is

about

always
will
be
ok
i
should
have
said
former

i
was
being
sarcastic
about
what
interventionists
want
to
do
i
suggest
you
listen
very
carefully
to
the
stuff
yeltsin
and
his
people
are
saying
and
compare
that
with
the
very
antiwest
slogans
coming
from
his
opponents
in
the
russian
congress
i
sure
know
who
i
want
to
back
could
we
back
him
without
forcing
others
to
back
him
at
the
point
of
a
gun
have
you
considered
a
noninterventionist
policy
if
market
reform
does
happen
russia
will
certainly
get
private
capital
at
private
risk
to
help
their
economy
they
will
even
have
incentive
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
government
will
probably
consider
them
enemies
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
then
theirs
the
ideological
point
we
want
to
win
russia
over
to
our
type
of
government
a
type
where
the
rulers
can
rule
without
limit
over
everyones
finances
its
like
subsidizing
the
wealthy
countries
japan
germany
etc
with
free
defense
and
then
tradewarring
with
them
because
of
the
economic
competition
its
like
subsidizing
tobacco
farmers
while
paying
bureaucrats
to
pursuade
people
not
to
smoke
better
to
let
them
degenerate
into
civil
war
remember
all
those
nuclear
weapons
in
russia
i
cannot
imagine
that
they
would
not
be
used
in
a
civil
war
if
nationialists
take
over
and
even
if
they
prevent
a
civil
war
most
feel
they
must
take
back
large
parts
of
land
that
are
in
other
countries
like
ukraine
i
also
cannot
imagine
ukraine
giving
up
land
without
a
fight
possibly
nuclear
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of
europe
are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
if
a
billion
gift
was
that
important
to
our
well
being
couldnt
it
be
raised
voluntarilly
people
already
give
over
billion
a
year
to
charity
i
ask
myself
what
law
could
we
pass
to
prevent
government
from
doing
stupid
frivilous
things
with
our
money
then
i
think
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
do
that
could
someone
please
tell
me
what
legitimate
constitutional
power
the
federal
government
is
using
when
it
takes
money
from
my
paycheck
and
gives
it
to
needy
countries
seriously
seriously
everyone
has
different
opinions
on
what
is
stupid
my
two
causes
are
aid
to
russia
and
a
strong
space
program
someone
else
will
champion
welfare
or
education
or
doing
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
that
is
why
we
have
a
republic
and
not
a
true
democracy
instead
of
gridlock
on
a
massive
scale
we
only
have
gridlock
on
a
congressional
scale
it
seems
instead
of
gridlock
on
any
scale
we
have
aid
to
russia
expensive
space
programs
national
charity
that
doesnt
help
the
poor
and
probably
studies
of
drunken
goldfish
i
think
limited
government
is
more
key
than
how
democratic
it
is
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
that
was
an
opinion
and
libertarians
are
very
big
on
free
speech
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
then
you
should
be
very
libertarian
consider
it
a
compromise
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaiders
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppose
werent
using
the

government
machine
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
causes
you
dont
support
we
could
do
that
years

but
not
now
people
have
been
saying
that
for
hundreds
of
years
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
making
all
the
more
reason
to
depend

the

so
we

and
whos
advocating

laws
are
aimed

the
motivations
of
the
acts
just

premeditated
homicide
is
treated
stricter
than
heatofpassion
homicide
but
you
still
get
into
trouble
for
example
how
often
are
crimes
of
violence
not
hate
crimes
the
question
is
then
who
are
you
hating
if
its
another
gang
member
then
its
better
than
if
the
person
you
hate
is
of
a
differnt
color
also
is
it
realistic
to
declare
that
crimes
of
hate
are
worse
than
crimes
of
gross
negligence
like
random
drive
by
shootings
where
they
cant
be
hate
crimes
because
the
shooter
doesnt
know
who
he
is
going
to
hit
he
just
shoots
into
the
crowd
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
was
with
the
current
mutation
of
the
us
constitution
under
the
current
police
state
someone
may
be
charged
multiple
times
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
single
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charge
so
if
i
set
off
a
bomb
in
the
world
trade
center
i
can
only
be
charged
with
more
than
one
murder
and
not
the
other
five
deaths
and
extensive
property
damage
after
all
the
bomb
was
a
single
act
first
i
heard
today
that
there
is
a
good
chance
that
the
us
instead
of
new
york
is
going
after
the
bombers
this
means
no
capital
punishment
secondly
double
jepardy
does
help
keep
the
government
from
going
after
you
for
first
one
murder
then
the
next
etc
a
sovereign
has
essentially
one
chance
with
a
single
fact
pattern
such
as
the
world
trade
center
bombing
that
is
why
the
bombers
will
in
all
probability
be
tried
for
all
the
deaths
as
well

would

disproportionately

ill
revisit
my
opinion
on
the
death
penalty
when
there
are
more
whites
up
for
it
than
blacks
ie
when
hell
freezes
over
why
dont
you
compare
the
rates
at
which
blacks
and
whites
commit
crimes
blacks
commit
crimes
disproportionately
so
in
a
perfectly
fair
penal
system
blacks
would
be
disproportionately
represented
note
black
vs
white
crime
rates
is
not
a
racial
thing
its
probably
an
economic
thing
poor
people
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
and
blacks
are
more
likely
to
be
poor
the
way
to
reduce
the
proportion
of
minorities
in
prison
is
to
increase
the
wealth
of
minorities

interesting
that
you
would
respond
emotionally
in
defense
of
the

maybe
there
is
a
beating

there
for
the

though
the
biggestbaddest
goverment
on
earth
claims
the
most
sovereignty
over
man
best
i
can
tell
god
allows
anyone
to
go
to
hell
who
wants
to
omnipotency
logically
determines
that
allowing
and
sending
mean
the

mere

so
come
on

why
bother
to

waco
proves
its

the

that

has

am
pst
folks
were
about
to
start
the
background
briefing
on
the
aid
package
senior
administration
official
good
morning
the
president
president
clinton
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
yesterday
on
a
series
of
american
initiatives
to
support
economic
and
political
reform
in
russia
and
its
valued
at
billion
before
taking
your
questions
and
running
through
the
basic
outlines
of
this
package
i
want
to
make
a
few
points
first
this
is
the
maximum
that
the
clinton
administration
can
do
with
available
funds
to
support
russian
reform
all
of
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
there
is
no
need
for
the
administration
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
fund
any
of
these
programs
all
our
fiscal
year
funds
currently
are
available
so
in
effect
all
of
these
programs
can
begin
tomorrow
the
second
point
is
that
this
package
is
designed
to
support
russian
reformers
all
of
the
initiatives
in
the
package
are
directed
at
reformers
and
for
their
benefit
and
all
have
been
worked
out
with
prior
consultation
with
the
russian
government
third
the
president
is
determined
that
we
will
deliver
on
these
commitments
this
year
the
package
is
designed
to
maximize
our
ability
to
support
reform
in
designing
it
we
wanted
to
avoid
making
commitments
that
we
could
not
meet
and
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
can
meet
all
of
these
commitments
in
front
of
you
fourth
id
like
to
note
the
special
importance
of
trade
and
investment
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
russias
capital
and
technology
needs
throughout
the
next
decade
extend
well
into
the
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
no
collection
of
governments
can
meet
those
needs
only
the
private
sector
can
do
so
and
so
the
president
and
president
yeltsin
agreed
to
make
trade
and
investment
a
major
priority
in
the
relationship
they
also
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
new
joint
commission
on
energy
and
space
formed
headed
on
the
us
side
by
vice
president
gore
on
the
russian
side
by
prime
minister
chernomyrdin
and
the
goal
of
this
effort
is
to
break
through
the
barriers
to
trade
and
investment
on
both
sides
and
to
promote
a
vastly
expanded
relationship
if
it
would
be
helpful
id
be
prepared
to
run
down
the
first
page
which
is
a
summary
of
us
assistance
and
just
give
you
some
general
background
on
what
these
programs
are
ill
do
it
quickly
and
then
ill
be
glad
to
take
questions
the
first
group
of
initiatives
are
humanitarian
food
and
medical
assistance
this
is
part
of
our
effort
which
has
been
underway
for
several
years
to
provide
basic
humanitarian
grant
food
assistance
so
that
the
russian
government
can
assure
theres
at
least
a
minimal
amount
of
bread
on
the
shelves
in
the
major
cities
thats
million
in
grant
that
is
from
food
for
progress
the
grant
portion
of
food
for
progress
well
also
be
continuing
our
grant
assistance
in
medicines
and
pharmaceutical
supplies
and
thats
million
the
second
item
is
concessional
food
sales
as
you
know
the
united
states
has
had
a
longterm
grain
relationship
with
russia
its
important
to
us
and
its
important
to
russia
that
we
continue
that
relationship
the
president
has
chosen
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
concessional
loan
program
the
value
over
the
next
seven
months
is
million
these
are
concessional
terms
the
exact
terms
have
not
been
worked
out
but
i
think
its
fair
to
say
there
will
be
a
grace
period
on
principal
of
six
or
seven
years
and
concessional
rates
thereafter
for
the
life
of
the
deal
the
third
program
is
a
collection
of
private
sector
support
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
were
going
to
do
privatization
and
the
creation
of
small
businesses
is
the
number
one
priority
of
the
reform
government
in
moscow
and
so
the
president
has
decided
to
create
a
russianamerican
enterprise
fund
capitalized
this
year
at
million
and
the
goal
of
this
fund
is
to
make
direct
loans
to
small
businesses
in
russia
to
take
equity
positions
in
those
businesses
the
president
has
also
decided
to
create
a
privatization
fund
which
would
work
directly
with
the
russian
government
in
its
priority
objective
of
trying
to
convert
state
enterprises
from
a
stateowned
basis
to
a
private
basis
he
has
also
agreed
the
president
has
also
agreed
to
establish
a
eurasia
foundation
this
would
be
a
private
foundation
led
by
prominent
americans
to
fund
democratization
projects
in
russia
the
fourth
grouping
you
see
there
in
the
summary
page
is
democratization
itself
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
this
administration
has
given
a
new
impetus
to
the
goal
of
pursuing
democratization
in
russia
you
see
that
we
have
a
total
of
million
in
programs
various
programs
the
detailed
tables
give
an
indication
of
some
of
the
programs
that
were
launching
the
president
is
also
calling
for
the
development
of
a
democracy
corps
which
will
be
an
overarching
umbrella
group
to
try
to
incorporate
all
of
the
disparate
private
and
public
efforts
now
underway
from
the
united
states
to
support
reform
in
russia
the
fifth
program
you
see
is
russian
office
of
resettlement
this
is
a
new
initiative
created
and
conceptualized
by
this
administration
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
wed
like
to
do
is
work
with
the
russian
military
to
help
resettle
russian
officers
returning
from
the
baltic
states
and
other
parts
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
work
out
the
best
way
to
do
that
whether
its
with
russian
labor
and
russian
materials
or
using
prefab
american
construction
and
so
weve
decided
to
fund
on
a
demonstration
basis
the
construction
of
housing
units
well
be
working
very
closely
with
the
russian
military
on
this
and
i
would
say
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
this
project
the
sixth
area
is
energy
in
the
environment
they
are
two
issues
that
the
president
feels
strongly
about
our
initial
efforts
will
be
feasibility
studies
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
enhancing
their
energy
production
both
oil
and
gas
and
equally
important
trying
to
cut
down
on
the
leakages
in
the
oil
and
gas
pipeline
systems
which
cause
so
much
environmental
damage
ive
talked
a
little
bit
about
trade
and
investment
about
the
new
group
being
created
that
the
vice
president
will
chair
on
our
side
secretary
ron
brown
will
also
be
cochairing
with
deputy
prime
minister
shohkin
a
business
development
committee
which
will
work
in
all
other
sectors
of
the
economy
to
break
down
the
many
barriers
that
currently
exist
and
impede
trade
and
investment
we
are
also
going
to
appoint
a
fulltime
investment
ombudsman
in
the
american
government
to
work
on
this
problem
fulltime
and
the
point
id
like
to
make
here
is
trade
and
investment
in
the
is
every
bit
as
important
to
draw
an
analogy
as
arms
reductions
was
in
the
and
and
we
just
thought
that
in
looking
at
this
we
needed
to
make
a
commitment
within
our
own
government
to
have
people
work
on
it
senior
people
on
a
fulltime
basis
because
it
is
terribly
important
youll
notice
that
the
united
states
is
going
to
support
russias
membership
in
the
gatt
russia
has
had
observer
status
russia
has
requested
our
support
and
in
fact
requested
our
advice
in
becoming
a
member
of
the
gatt
we
think
that
the
longterm
goal
of
drawing
russia
into
the
global
economy
is
paramount
a
very
important
goal
and
that
is
why
we
are
supporting
the
membership
in
the
gatt
we
are
also
supporting
their
access
to
gsp
the
generalized
system
of
preferences
youll
note
that
exim
has
extended
million
in
credit
for
a
caterpillar
deal
in
siberia
that
opic
has
extended
million
in
credits
and
loan
guarantees
for
a
conoco
oil
project
id
like
to
emphasize
that
we
are
very
close
to
an
agreement
between
russia
and
the
united
states
for
a
framework
facility
through
the
exim
bank
that
would
finance
russian
purchases
of
american
oil
and
gas
equipment
and
services
we
think
this
is
a
very
important
development
we
think
well
get
there
by
april
which
is
the
opening
day
of
the
tokyo
conference
the
conference
before
i
take
any
further
questions
id
like
to
defer
to
my
colleague
who
will
review
the
security
assistance
objectives
with
you
senior
administration
official
our
major
unfinished
agenda
with
the
russians
and
with
their
counterparts
in
ukraine
kazakhstan
and
belarus
is
in
the
area
of
the
safe
and
secure
dismantlement
of
the
nuclear
arsenals
on
their
territory
under
the
terms
of
the
start
i
and
start
ii
agreements
recently
we
completed
in
moscow
three
i
think
very
important
agreements
that
devote
a
significant
chunk
of
nunnlugar
funding
to
three
important
programs
the
first
is
the
program
of
million
for
the
strategic
nuclear
delivery
vehicle
dismantlement
program
that
is
for
submarines
for
icbm
dismantlement
and
for
bomber
dismantlement
million
the
second
is
a
million
tranche
of
funding
for
the
construction
of
a
facility
to
store
nuclear
materials
removed
from
the
warheads
as
they
are
dismantled
this
will
essentially
contribute
to
the
overall
design
and
the
early
phases
of
the
construction
of
that
storage
facility
and
finally
a
tranche
of
money
to
help
in
the
establishment
of
a
monitoring
system
for
the
nuclear
materials
as
they
are
withdrawn
from
the
weapons
system
so
we
add
that
total
to
the
extant
nunnlugar
assistance
which
has
been
flowing
about
million
for
some
overall
safety
improvements
for
various
kinds
of
equipment
and
safety
measures
that
we
have
been
working
out
with
the
russians
over
the
last
couple
of
years
so
this
is
an
area
where
we
will
be
going
a
lot
more
work
with
not
only
the
russians
but
with
the
ukrainians
kazhaks
and
belarussians
belarus
for
example
has
just
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
received
up
to
million
in
funds
for
safety
security
and
dismantlement
programs
on
belarussian
territory
and
this
was
in
the
wake
of
their
ratification
of
start
i
an
agreement
to
accede
to
npt
so
we
are
working
very
hard
with
all
the
parties
to
the
lisbon
protocols
and
will
continue
to
work
very
hard
with
them
and
i
look
upon
these
three
recent
agreements
with
russia
as
a
very
important
step
in
that
process
q
the
opic
funds
to
is
that
for
the
field
in
kazhakstan
and
conoco
already
signed
this
deal
with
kazhakstan
why
do
you
feel
now
it
is
necessary
if
its
the
same
one
why
do
you
feel
its
necessary
senior
administration
official
its
not
the
same
deal
chevron
signed
a
deal
with
kazhakstan
the
tenges
oil
field
this
is
a
new
investment
project
its
a
polar
lights
oil
development
and
renovation
project
and
its
being
announced
today
so
its
completely
new
q
can
you
tell
us
more
about
whats
involved
senior
administration
official
yes
conoco
like
other
american
oil
companies
has
been
searching
for
ways
to
do
two
things
one
to
prospect
for
new
oil
in
siberia
west
siberia
and
two
to
try
to
get
into
the
business
of
renovating
oil
wells
and
renovating
pipelines
both
oil
and
gas
in
russia
the
objective
here
obviously
is
to
take
advantage
of
the
natural
resources
in
russia
increase
energy
production
which
will
in
turn
increase
hard
currency
revenues
which
is
what
russia
needs
so
we
think
this
deal
is
very
very
good
development
for
russia
the
russians
do
as
well
and
its
good
for
an
american
company
and
the
american
government
has
played
a
leading
role
in
pulling
this
together
through
the
credit
facility
in
opic
and
through
the
loan
guarantee
q
so
its
to
search
and
also
to
renovate
fields
that
are
already
there
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
on
that
point
should
other
american
companies
expect
to
get
administration
support
for
such
deals
or
should
they
now
go
to
the
exim
and
try
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
billion
senior
administration
official
well
as
you
know
exim
is
part
of
the
us
government
and
various
parts
of
the
us
government
have
been
pushing
including
the
state
department
and
the
white
house
for
this
deal
to
be
consummated
and
we
think
it
will
and
if
we
arrive
at
this
agreement
by
april
there
will
be
billion
in
financing
available
for
american
companies
to
sell
their
equipment
and
sell
their
services
q
that
should
take
up
all
of
the
rest
of
the
deals
and
their
wont
be
and
their
will
or
there
wont
be
support
for
opic
sort
of
deals
such
as
this
conoco
senior
administration
official
theres
a
tremendous
amount
of
interest
on
the
part
of
american
oil
and
gas
companies
to
invest
in
russia
we
think
that
the
exim
oil
and
gas
facility
the
facility
once
it
is
concluded
will
soak
up
a
lot
of
that
interest
but
i
think
the
interest
may
even
extend
beyond
that
and
if
so
the
government
will
respond
q
whats
the
current
year
budget
costs
of
that
agreement
should
it
go
forward
and
is
there
any
current
year
budget
costs
senior
administration
official
ill
have
to
refer
you
to
exim
for
that
i
dont
know
the
details
of
that
q
the
concessional
food
sales
is
there
any
current
year
costs
to
that
or
is
it
delayed
until
the
years
in
which
the
payments
are
due
senior
administration
official
the
concessional
food
sales
are
from
food
for
progress
which
is
a
usda
program
usda
has
the
funds
we
dont
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
expend
those
funds
there
will
be
a
hit
in
the
budget
id
refer
you
to
usda
and
omb
for
the
details
on
that
q
can
you
talk
about
the
democracy
corps
q
and
the
private
sector
how
many
folks
are
going
to
be
involved
in
that
senior
administration
official
why
dont
i
start
with
the
democracy
corps
first
i
think
the
administration
felt
coming
into
office
that
there
were
literally
thousands
of
organization
private
organizations
in
the
united
states
that
in
one
way
or
another
were
working
at
the
goal
of
trying
to
achieve
democratization
in
russia
helping
on
a
farmertofarmer
basis
and
there
were
literally
or
us
government
agencies
that
had
a
variety
of
programs
in
this
area
and
so
the
administration
felt
the
president
felt
it
was
important
to
try
to
draw
all
of
these
initiatives
together
under
one
group
to
give
some
coherence
to
the
efforts
and
to
give
some
impetus
to
the
efforts
and
so
this
is
a
presidential
initiative
it
will
be
headed
by
ambassador
tom
simons
who
will
soon
take
up
his
duties
as
the
coordinator
for
us
assistance
in
the
former
soviet
union
and
were
very
hopeful
that
we
might
use
this
democracy
corps
not
only
to
draw
upon
the
resources
of
our
own
government
but
the
resources
of
the
american
private
sector
and
schools
and
communities
across
the
nation
q
any
kind
of
commitment
yet
any
kind
of
word
yet
on
and
any
new
money
that
needs
to
be
appropriated
besides
the
million
the
president
talked
about
senior
administration
official
the
administration
is
requesting
additional
funds
in
of
million
what
the
president
has
done
this
weekend
is
to
consult
really
intensively
yesterday
with
president
yeltsin
about
additional
measures
the
united
states
could
take
in
some
of
these
areas
to
support
reform
hell
be
consulting
with
the
congress
when
he
returns
to
washington
hell
be
consulting
also
with
the
other
ally
governments
and
well
make
a
decision
at
that
time
q
two
questions
about
the
billion
agricultural
money
first
of
all
i
thought
it
was
the
sort
of
consensus
that
what
russia
did
not
need
was
more
loans
for
food
so
why
did
you
decide
to
do
it
that
way
secondly
could
you
explain
agriculture
has
been
stopped
from
making
further
loans
for
food
because
of
russias
inability
to
pay
how
does
this
fit
into
that
situation
senior
administration
official
as
you
know
the
united
states
for
a
long
time
has
been
a
major
supplier
of
grains
and
food
commodities
agricultural
products
to
russia
i
think
between
and
we
had
extended
a
little
bit
of
history
here
about
billion
in
credits
credit
guarantees
through
the
commodity
credit
corporation
that
was
the
principal
vehicle
to
ensure
the
sale
of
american
grain
products
on
december
of
last
year
the
russian
government
stopped
its
payments
on
that
program
they
are
now
in
arrears
to
us
on
that
program
and
therefore
by
law
the
united
states
cannot
continue
that
program
and
so
the
president
working
with
secretary
espy
and
other
officials
in
the
cabinet
looked
for
other
ways
that
we
could
promote
american
grain
sales
and
i
think
we
have
two
ways
to
do
that
weve
announced
today
million
in
grant
food
assistance
through
the
food
for
progress
program
but
we
do
not
have
sufficient
authority
to
spend
million
in
grant
food
and
so
we
looked
for
a
concessional
loan
program
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
russia
that
a
shortterm
loan
program
for
russia
would
not
make
sense
now
but
a
longterm
concessional
loan
program
would
and
that
is
what
this
program
is
it
will
provide
once
the
final
details
are
worked
out
for
a
six
to
sevenyear
grace
period
on
payments
of
principal
and
then
from
years
seven
through
which
is
the
life
of
the
deal
it
will
provide
for
concessional
rates
of
interest
generally
around
three
to
four
percent
and
so
we
believe
and
the
russian
government
believes
this
is
a
good
deal
for
them
because
it
will
avoid
the
imperative
of
early
payments
and
put
them
into
the
out
years
but
it
will
also
continue
this
very
important
grain
relationship
which
is
important
for
them
and
its
important
for
the
american
farm
community
q
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
this
could
make
it
explicit
the
russians
failure
to
pay
the
interest
on
ecc
loan
does
not
in
any
way
affect
this
kind
of
loan
going
through
is
that
right
senior
administration
official
let
me
be
explicit
about
that
we
are
prevented
under
the
law
to
from
continuing
the
commodity
credit
corporation
shortterm
credit
program
because
of
russias
arrearages
to
the
united
states
all
of
you
know
about
those
arrearages
they
total
about
i
think
around
million
usda
can
give
you
an
exact
figure
so
having
taken
that
into
consideration
and
wanting
to
preserve
american
market
share
and
a
longterm
grain
relationship
wanting
to
respond
to
a
specific
request
from
the
russian
government
for
major
food
assistance
knowing
that
we
couldnt
take
it
from
the
grant
programs
because
we
dont
have
sufficient
authority
there
we
looked
at
food
for
progress
which
is
a
program
weve
used
to
great
effect
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
we
consulted
with
the
russian
government
and
arrived
at
this
solution
i
think
the
russians
are
pleased
because
it
provides
them
with
the
food
but
also
gives
them
a
little
bit
of
relief
on
the
shortterm
payments
q
where
do
those
funds
actually
come
from
senior
administration
official
they
come
from
the
food
for
progress
program
which
is
a
program
under
usdas
authority
usda
has
the
authority
to
spend
these
funds
we
do
not
need
to
go
back
to
the
congress
for
these
funds
and
i
want
to
make
that
general
point
again
everything
in
this
package
the
billion
package
comprises
funds
that
have
already
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
the
administration
can
begin
to
spend
these
monies
tomorrow
and
its
very
important
in
our
eyes
that
we
expend
all
the
funds
this
year
that
we
meet
these
commitments
and
we
are
confident
well
be
able
to
do
so
q
how
did
you
arrive
at
the
figure
of
million
does
that
max
out
that
program
or
did
you
actually
have
a
range
from
to
senior
administration
official
theres
a
reason
for
it
the
reason
was
that
the
russian
government
told
us
thats
about
the
amount
of
grain
that
they
needed
between
now
and
harvest
time
and
so
the
idea
is
that
we
would
begin
the
shipments
probably
million
per
month
from
now
until
the
harvest
in
the
autumn
at
which
time
russia
wont
require
the
same
level
of
food
imports
from
the
west
q
i
would
imagine
theres
going
to
be
some
considerable
envy
and
jealousy
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
other
republics
because
of
the
size
and
the
scope
of
this
with
russia
have
you
given
any
consideration
to
advancing
negotiations
for
the
same
kinds
of
projects
with
the
ukraine
with
georgia
with
some
of
the
other
republics
senior
administration
official
yes
were
very
conscience
of
the
fact
that
we
also
have
an
interest
in
extending
american
support
to
the
other
countries
of
the
former
soviet
union
we
have
told
ourselves
and
we
have
planned
that
in
the
area
of
technical
assistance
the
grant
technical
assistance
that
you
see
roughly
percent
of
the
funding
will
go
to
russia
and
roughly
percent
to
the
other
countries
in
the
area
of
food
sales
we
have
been
active
with
ukraine
in
grant
food
assistance
with
georgia
and
armenia
we
will
continue
that
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
after
this
summit
we
will
go
back
and
look
at
all
of
our
programs
with
the
other
countries
to
ensure
that
they
are
adequate
and
they
are
productive
and
theyre
hardhitting
q
has
anything
happened
at
the
summit
to
lead
american
energy
companies
and
other
companies
to
believe
that
russia
is
going
to
be
more
userfriendly
toward
them
in
terms
of
taxing
legalities
bureaucracy
senior
administration
official
well
one
of
our
primary
objectives
coming
into
this
summit
was
to
highlight
not
only
the
economic
agenda
but
also
trade
and
investment
and
id
like
to
refer
to
the
point
i
made
at
the
beginning
were
convinced
in
talking
about
this
problem
the
problem
of
how
to
support
russia
longterm
were
convinced
that
no
collection
of
western
governments
have
the
financial
resources
over
the
next
decade
to
fuel
the
continuation
of
reform
that
only
the
private
sector
can
do
that
we
look
at
our
own
society
and
we
see
tremendous
capability
in
resources
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
it
is
a
very
good
match
with
what
the
russians
need
now
which
is
financial
investment
in
the
existing
oil
and
gas
wells
and
pipeline
and
new
technology
and
new
capital
to
finance
new
production
thats
what
the
russian
government
has
told
us
it
wants
to
do
and
so
thats
why
we
have
made
such
a
major
emphasis
on
it
thats
why
trade
and
investment
was
a
prominent
issue
on
the
first
day
of
these
talks
and
in
fact
figured
prominently
last
night
in
the
meeting
between
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
and
were
hoping
that
together
we
might
send
a
strong
signal
to
the
american
business
community
that
we
support
their
efforts
to
invest
in
russia
that
the
united
states
through
ex
im
and
opec
and
the
department
of
commerce
will
be
there
to
support
them
q
my
question
is
is
yeltsin
in
any
position
to
deliver
on
making
russia
a
more
senior
administration
official
we
think
he
is
i
would
note
that
president
yeltsins
prime
minister
mr
chernomyrdin
worked
for
years
in
the
russian
oil
and
gas
sector
he
will
now
chair
a
highlevel
commission
with
the
vice
president
vice
president
gore
to
try
to
break
through
the
barriers
that
currently
exist
to
western
investment
in
the
oil
and
gas
sector
we
believe
we
have
a
commitment
to
make
that
committee
an
important
committee
and
were
looking
forward
to
the
work
q
what
type
of
mechanism
is
already
in
place
to
administer
the
private
sector
portion
of
the
program
and
will
the
us
be
directly
involved
in
the
tail
end
of
distribution
of
the
actual
funds
or
is
the
money
simply
turned
over
to
the
russian
government
for
distribution
at
their
will
senior
administration
official
are
you
talking
about
the
variety
of
programs
listed
here
it
depends
on
the
program
itself
in
most
cases
though
we
are
either
working
through
american
pbos
or
american
government
agencies
to
ensure
that
the
money
obviously
is
well
spent
that
the
money
gets
to
the
intended
source
thats
an
obligation
we
have
to
the
congress
to
ensure
the
money
is
well
spent
and
that
we
can
account
for
the
money
we
have
done
that
in
the
last
couple
of
months
intensively
and
we
will
continue
to
do
it
for
each
of
these
programs
but
they
are
all
quite
different
for
instance
in
the
area
of
grant
food
and
medical
assistance
for
grant
food
it
is
carried
out
through
usda
and
usda
accounts
for
the
delivery
of
the
food
for
grant
medical
assistance
weve
been
working
through
project
hope
which
is
a
private
organization
for
the
housing
for
instance
the
resettlement
of
russian
officers
well
be
working
with
a
group
of
american
pbos
on
some
of
the
democratization
projects
were
working
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
and
private
foundations
were
working
with
journalists
in
russia
on
a
media
project
that
you
may
have
noticed
so
we
literally
have
here
to
different
activities
under
all
these
rubrics
and
theyre
all
going
to
be
carried
out
in
slightly
different
ways
some
directly
with
the
russian
government
some
with
russian
citizens
q
the
jacksonvanik
restrictions
that
remain
and
on
the
cocom
restrictions
that
remain
can
you
tell
us
what
the
president
has
to
do
on
that
senior
administration
official
well
as
george
noted
yesterday
president
yeltsin
raised
these
as
irritants
in
the
relationship
the
president
has
noted
that
i
think
its
fair
to
say
we
will
go
back
now
in
our
own
government
when
we
return
to
washington
and
look
at
both
of
these
questions
and
well
get
back
to
the
russian
government
q
you
were
not
prepared
for
these
questions
when
you
got
here
senior
administration
official
we
were
prepared
for
these
questions
weve
looked
at
them
but
were
not
prepared
to
make
a
quick
decision
this
weekend
they
require
let
me
just
explain
particularly
on
jacksonvanik
they
require
consultation
with
the
congress
they
require
consultation
with
the
american
jewish
community
and
were
very
sensitive
to
those
concerns
and
so
well
want
to
go
back
and
talk
to
them
before
we
take
any
action
q
is
this
package
designed
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
go
to
congress
for
anything
at
this
point
senior
administration
official
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
the
advantage
of
this
particular
package
is
that
all
the
funds
have
been
allocated
and
appropriated
by
the
congress
so
the
administration
will
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
congress
to
seek
any
additional
authority
to
fund
any
of
these
efforts
in
effect
they
can
all
begin
tomorrow
and
i
know
that
many
of
the
agencies
responsible
for
these
projects
will
begin
tomorrow
and
thats
the
advantage
of
this
particular
initiative
q
if
this
as
the
president
says
is
a
longterm
longhaul
thing
and
members
of
congress
are
at
this
moment
heading
for
moscow
why
arent
you
talking
about
going
to
congress
and
suggesting
to
the
president
of
russia
that
you
are
prepared
to
go
to
congress
for
various
things
senior
administration
official
i
think
weve
been
clear
about
that
the
president
is
discussing
this
weekend
with
president
yeltsin
some
additional
ideas
that
we
have
for
american
funding
of
additional
projects
and
ideas
that
he
has
we
have
a
major
congressional
delegation
that
left
last
night
headed
by
representative
gephardt
and
well
want
to
consult
with
that
delegation
and
other
members
of
congress
before
doing
anything
and
well
also
want
to
consult
with
our
allies
so
thats
where
it
stands
now
q
weve
been
told
repeatedly
that
a
number
of
these
items
represent
different
or
new
ways
of
spending
the
money
already
appropriated
could
you
just
tick
off
which
of
these
items
represents
reprogramming
or
at
least
spending
money
in
ways
that
it
was
not
previously
set
to
be
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
weve
said
that
these
are
all
projects
that
either
congress
had
allocated
money
for
through
the
freedom
support
act
there
were
some
funds
that
were
left
over
from
and
this
administration
took
office
and
had
some
new
ideas
about
how
the
funds
might
be
expended
we
didnt
use
just
the
freedom
support
act
funds
or
the
funds
we
went
into
some
of
the
agency
allocations
exim
opic
and
usda
and
tried
to
look
for
creative
ways
to
further
our
programs
and
example
of
that
is
the
food
for
progress
concessional
loans
we
had
hit
a
brick
wall
with
another
type
of
funding
through
usda
we
could
not
go
forward
legally
and
so
we
looked
for
a
more
creative
way
to
ensure
continued
american
market
share
and
ensure
continued
grain
sales
and
we
think
we
found
it
q
where
for
example
are
you
getting
the
money
for
this
russian
officer
resettlement
senior
administration
official
thats
from
the
freedom
support
act
funds
q
in
other
words
all
of
the
money
is
being
directly
spent
in
new
ways
so
to
speak
senior
administration
official
most
of
the
grant
projects
that
you
see
if
you
look
at
the
general
chart
the
second
chart
its
broken
down
into
grant
and
credits
and
if
you
look
under
grants
the
technical
cooperation
projects
that
total
million
that
is
almost
all
freedom
support
act
funding
a
little
bit
of
it
is
leftover
funds
from
fiscal
year
the
nunnlugar
funds
of
course
you
know
about
the
legislative
history
of
those
funds
q
cooperation
senior
administration
official
from
fy
i
dont
have
the
exact
figure
it
was
not
a
considerable
figure
q
could
you
tell
us
please
has
anything
happened
here
this
weekend
that
will
break
the
log
jam
between
ukraine
and
russia
over
start
for
start
i
and
ii
as
a
result
of
whats
happened
here
senior
administration
official
both
presidents
president
yeltsin
and
president
clinton
will
be
discussing
this
issue
this
morning
in
fact
we
havent
yet
gotten
to
security
and
arms
control
related
issues
that
will
be
this
mornings
session
i
know
that
president
clinton
will
be
very
strongly
reinforcing
that
this
is
a
top
priority
for
us
weve
been
talking
to
the
russians
and
the
ukrainians
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
about
ways
that
we
might
help
to
facilitate
the
discussions
between
them
up
to
this
point
this
has
been
a
very
important
negotiation
thats
been
going
on
essentially
between
moscow
and
kiev
and
we
are
at
the
point
now
of
essentially
discussing
with
them
if
there
are
ways
that
we
could
contribute
to
this
discussion
help
to
move
things
forward
essentially
but
in
terms
of
what
is
coming
out
of
this
weekend
i
dont
yet
know
in
a
couple
hours
well
know
q
just
a
followup
on
the
financing
here
is
any
of
this
robbing
peter
to
pay
boris
since
its
all
current
year
appropriations
have
you
taken
it
from
anyplace
thats
been
earmarked
and
put
it
into
this
fund
senior
administration
official
there
are
smoke
and
mirrors
here
and
i
think
its
an
important
point
to
note
we
could
have
given
you
a
page
of
assistance
numbers
that
included
outyear
funding
were
going
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
many
of
these
projects
for
instance
the
enterprise
funds
the
privatization
effort
the
housing
effort
and
weve
already
talked
to
the
russians
about
our
longterm
commitment
we
could
have
put
in
really
big
numbers
and
this
could
have
been
a
bigger
package
but
we
wanted
to
make
a
point
this
package
is
fy
its
funds
that
we
have
and
were
going
to
do
what
we
say
were
going
to
do
and
the
president
feels
very
strongly
about
that
in
the
past
there
is
a
legacy
that
the
western
governments
the
combination
of
governments
put
up
large
budget
figures
and
for
any
number
of
reasons
were
not
able
to
meet
them
were
determined
and
the
president
is
determined
to
carry
out
every
single
program
in
this
package
and
well
do
it
but
we
do
have
a
longerterm
commitment
and
thats
part
of
the
discussions
on
economics
this
weekend
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
on
what
it
is
we
can
do
to
most
effectively
support
reform
and
weve
told
them
that
we
do
have
a
commitment
on
some
of
these
programs
beyond
this
fiscal
year
q
taken
it
way
from
any
senior
administration
official
no
we
havent
okay
the
question
is
have
we
reprogrammed
any
of
these
funds
so
have
we
taken
it
from
other
countries
to
pay
for
programs
in
russia
the
answer
is
no
we
have
not
done
so
q
in
terms
of
funding
there
is
no
available
monies
left
and
you
simply
find
a
creative
way
to
find
money
somewhere
else
doesnt
that
in
fact
support
the
theory
senior
administration
official
not
at
all
i
dont
think
it
does
thats
a
particular
example
and
the
example
is
grain
sales
the
commodity
credit
corporation
credit
guarantee
program
was
shortterm
loans
that
russia
had
to
pay
back
within
to
months
you
all
know
about
russias
debt
problem
and
russia
was
unable
to
meet
those
commitments
so
we
looked
for
a
way
to
do
two
things
to
meet
russias
requirement
for
grain
theyre
a
net
grain
importer
on
a
massive
scale
and
also
meet
our
objective
of
making
sure
that
the
american
farmers
have
a
chance
to
sell
their
products
to
russia
and
we
simply
look
for
another
way
to
finance
that
and
we
have
legislative
authority
to
do
it
this
program
has
been
successful
in
other
areas
we
had
not
tried
it
before
in
the
former
soviet
union
but
we
thought
we
should
now
q
isnt
this
really
the
bushclinton
aid
package
for
russia
since
these
funds
were
really
first
derived
by
initiatives
put
forward
by
president
bush
senior
administration
official
no
i
dont
think
thats
a
fair
characterization
a
lot
of
these
funds
were
appropriated
by
the
us
congress
is
in
this
administration
took
office
and
inherited
some
obligations
that
the
bush
administration
had
made
but
we
had
a
long
six
to
seven
week
review
of
this
program
we
decided
to
meet
the
commitments
that
had
been
made
by
the
previous
administration
but
we
have
gone
well
beyond
them
in
funding
the
enterprise
fund
which
was
just
an
idea
but
the
idea
had
not
been
filled
out
with
a
program
there
was
no
number
attached
to
it
in
grouping
together
some
projects
and
trying
to
make
them
into
a
coherent
whole
in
the
privatization
effort
i
would
say
is
another
clinton
initiative
further
we
listened
to
the
russian
government
and
listened
to
the
russian
military
who
told
us
that
the
resettlement
of
their
officers
was
important
to
them
for
political
and
economic
and
social
reasons
and
president
clinton
has
responded
to
that
and
we
are
making
a
longterm
commitment
that
beyond
this
demonstration
project
were
going
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
much
more
in
trying
to
settle
those
officers
i
would
also
say
that
the
president
has
given
impetus
to
all
of
us
in
the
agencies
to
think
much
more
broadly
about
what
it
is
we
can
do
on
democratization
because
there
we
have
some
experience
and
some
comparative
advantage
that
lends
itself
to
the
russian
experience
and
in
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
which
is
another
new
initiative
were
hopeful
that
we
can
take
the
resources
of
the
private
sector
as
well
as
the
american
government
to
achieve
that
objective
so
i
would
not
characterize
it
that
way
at
all
and
as
most
of
you
know
i
am
a
career
civil
servant
i
was
in
the
last
administration
im
very
familiar
with
what
the
last
administration
did
and
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
clinton
assistance
package
for
russia
q
theres
been
a
lot
of
criticism
that
aid
in
the
past
has
not
gotten
to
the
people
is
there
anything
in
this
outside
of
the
ombudsman
that
will
guarantee
that
this
money
will
not
just
disappear
because
its
being
administered
by
the
russian
government
senior
administration
official
i
think
that
i
know
that
the
president
and
other
senior
officials
of
our
government
are
concerned
that
american
money
be
spent
wisely
and
that
it
get
to
the
source
that
its
intended
for
which
its
intended
and
so
were
going
to
take
great
care
aid
and
the
state
department
will
take
great
care
in
making
sure
that
the
funds
are
expended
properly
and
that
theyre
reaching
their
source
i
would
not
that
this
package
is
not
simply
a
package
of
support
solely
to
the
russian
government
some
of
these
projects
especially
in
democratization
and
exchanges
are
going
to
be
worked
out
directly
with
russian
private
individuals
with
businesses
the
private
enterprise
support
is
another
example
of
that
senior
administration
official
if
i
could
just
add
a
word
on
this
point
with
regard
to
the
ssdrelated
programs
one
area
that
weve
been
looking
at
very
very
closely
is
consideration
of
actually
using
russian
firms
in
subcontracting
for
these
kinds
of
programs
they
would
be
working
very
closely
of
course
with
the
american
firms
who
would
be
the
prime
contractors
but
this
is
a
fine
example
i
think
of
a
more
of
a
imaginative
and
flexible
approach
toward
getting
some
of
that
funding
down
to
the
grassroots
level
down
to
the
ground
in
russia
but
at
the
same
time
ensuring
that
it
is
spent
efficiently
and
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended
q
when
would
the
democracy
corps
start
exactly
when
do
you
see
this
happening
how
would
get
it
off
the
ground
senior
administration
official
well
the
president
is
today
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
democracy
corps
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
were
going
to
work
out
its
framework
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
ambassador
simons
takes
up
his
duties
on
may
but
in
effect
weve
already
started
because
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
the
administration
has
begun
to
reach
out
to
people
in
the
private
sector
who
have
come
to
us
asking
us
to
help
facilitate
their
activities
in
russia
and
weve
said
that
we
will
be
helpful
weve
also
tried
to
kind
of
coordinate
in
a
much
more
effective
way
the
activities
of
our
own
government
we
do
have
or
agencies
that
are
active
in
russia
in
one
way
or
another
we
think
it
makes
sense
to
draw
them
together
and
to
focus
their
efforts
q
excuse
me
how
much
of
this
billion
will
actually
be
spent
in
the
united
states
by
american
made
goods
senior
administration
official
i
dont
have
any
figures
for
you
now
but
perhaps
we
could
try
to
work
something
up
in
the
next
couple
of
days
on
that
q
this
figure
is
larger
than
the
figure
that
has
been
in
the
press
did
this
program
grow
yesterday
as
a
result
of
the
discussions
or
have
we
just
been
that
far
off
the
mark
senior
administration
official
no
i
think
unfortunately
the
press
has
been
a
little
bit
off
the
mark
and
im
sorry
to
say
that
no
this
package
president
clinton
put
us
to
work
about
seven
weeks
ago
on
this
package
and
he
was
briefed
intensively
on
this
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
intellectual
leadership
in
this
package
he
contributed
a
lot
of
the
ideas
in
the
package
and
i
think
its
fair
to
say
that
we
had
this
rough
package
worked
out
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
been
refining
it
ever
since
we
spent
a
couple
of
days
last
week
going
over
it
with
the
russian
government
both
the
embassy
in
washington
and
the
government
in
moscow
through
our
own
embassy
and
so
its
been
evolving
but
this
particular
package
has
been
together
for
about
two
weeks
q
where
is
yeltsins
input
into
this
then
there
was
so
much
talk
before
about
the
president
wanted
to
get
yeltsins
views
about
specifically
what
was
needed
and
so
forth
is
that
in
the
out
years
senior
administration
official
no
its
both
president
yeltsin
has
on
several
occasions
told
us
for
instance
that
support
for
the
creation
of
private
businesses
is
important
to
him
that
the
resettlement
of
russian
military
officers
is
important
and
that
first
and
foremost
the
effort
to
privatize
the
state
industries
is
important
to
them
and
so
what
we
did
was
to
try
to
make
those
the
centerpiece
of
our
technical
assistance
part
o
the
package
we
listened
to
him
on
the
privatization
effort
we
have
been
working
with
the
russian
government
for
months
on
this
trying
to
work
out
all
the
details
so
the
russian
government
on
most
of
these
programs
was
involved
every
step
of
the
way
but
let
me
get
at
the
other
part
of
your
question
the
president
is
also
using
this
weekend
to
talk
about
a
broader
set
of
initiatives
that
we
might
undertake
and
were
looking
for
his
ideas
the
president
has
brought
his
own
ideas
to
the
table
for
instance
on
energy
and
the
environment
and
in
housing
but
were
looking
for
russian
ideas
not
we
need
to
consult
with
the
congress
and
we
need
to
consult
with
the
other
allied
governments
that
are
also
active
q
theres
essentially
nothing
that
happened
in
the
last
day
and
a
half
that
measurably
altered
the
package
that
you
came
in
with
senior
administration
official
this
particular
package
as
i
said
was
worked
out
and
was
ready
about
two
weeks
ago
we
have
since
then
consulted
with
the
russian
government
on
the
final
stages
of
its
development
and
so
this
weekend
weve
primarily
talked
about
future
about
what
more
the
united
states
and
other
western
countries
can
do
to
support
reform
in
russia
which
is
our
base
objective
here
q
i
noticed
that
you
that
money
appropriated
to
train
bankers
and
businessmen
and
officers
can
you
tell
me
what
about
job
training
for
workers
who
are
displaced
by
privatization
senior
administration
official
youre
right
we
have
a
program
to
train
russian
young
russians
in
banking
and
financial
services
in
the
united
states
part
of
the
housing
initiative
its
not
just
to
build
housing
units
its
to
retrain
russian
officers
who
are
retiring
into
other
professions
q
money
for
job
training
for
workers
whose
jobs
are
disappearing
because
of
privatization
senior
administration
official
we
have
not
yet
allocated
any
money
for
that
q
why
not
q
of
the
million
is
going
to
build
housing
units
isnt
that
a
lot
of
money
per
unit
given
what
the
western
dollar
will
buy
in
the
former
soviet
union
senior
administration
official
if
you
want
to
do
housing
the
right
way
its
not
just
the
building
the
framework
of
a
house
youve
got
to
think
about
all
the
utilities
youve
got
to
think
about
the
purchase
of
land
youve
got
to
think
about
sewage
and
gas
and
electricity
and
so
forth
and
its
also
retraining
its
not
enough
to
put
retired
an
officer
coming
out
of
riga
or
tallin
or
vilnius
in
a
house
in
western
russia
we
think
we
have
an
obligation
to
try
to
retrain
those
officers
as
well
this
is
responding
to
a
request
from
the
russian
government
q
of
the
million
will
go
to
retrain
senior
administration
official
thats
right
q
are
you
talking
about
apartment
buildings
or
single
senior
administration
official
were
talking
about
single
individual
dwellings
q
youre
saying
that
only
families
will
be
served
by
this
senior
administration
official
what
i
want
to
i
thought
i
pointed
out
earlier
this
is
a
demonstration
project
what
we
didnt
want
to
do
given
the
experience
that
the
germans
and
the
turks
and
the
italians
have
had
in
building
housing
in
western
russian
we
did
not
want
to
leap
into
it
with
a
huge
amount
of
money
what
we
want
to
do
is
work
over
the
next
couple
of
months
and
try
to
figure
out
with
american
organizations
in
the
private
sector
the
best
way
to
get
this
job
done
i
noted
that
we
have
a
longterm
commitment
to
that
and
so
i
would
expect
that
we
would
put
a
lot
more
money
into
this
in
the
future
but
we
want
to
do
it
wisely
we
want
to
spend
the
money
wisely
q
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
convinces
you
that
it
will
protect
russias
reforms
and
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position

may
back

theyre
supposed
to
pay
back
especially
considering
their

problem
senior
administration
official
well
look
i
think
its
important
to
note
that
the
united
states
on
its
own
does
not
have
the
capability
to
fuel
a
continuation
of
russian
reform
its
got
to
be
a
collective
western
effort
and
were
looking
to
our
allies
to
do
more
as
well
but
beyond
that
its
really
what
the
russians
do
that
is
going
to
decide
the
fate
of
reform
we
can
simply
play
a
role
and
we
feel
we
have
an
obligation
to
do
so
which
is
consistent
with
our
national
interests
q
did
the
president
say
that
the
value
of
the
us
contribution
was
that
it
would
create
security
and
prosperity
for
the
united
states
so
what
is
it
about
this
program
that
does
this
senior
administration
official
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
fundamental
objective
of
our
policy
toward
russia
and
that
is
we
want
to
do
everything
we
can
to
support
the
continuation
of
reform
we
are
convinced
that
if
reformers
stay
in
power
then
well
be
able
to
continue
the
drawdown
of
nuclear
forces
foreign
policy
cooperation
and
economic
interaction
which
are
the
three
benefits
to
the
united
states
from
reform
in
russia
so
its
not
a
simple
question
you
cant
just
say
that
this
program
is
the
answer
its
a
longterm
question
and
we
have
to
make
a
longterm
commitment
to
it
q
and
then
on
the
question
of
russias
ability
to
repay
what
convinces
you
theyll
be
able
to
pay
seven
to
years
from
now
senior
administration
official
well
the
russian
government
has
made
a
commitment
to
repay
and
what
were
hoping
is
that
if
reform
continues
and
if
they
can
continue
to
improve
their
oil
and
gas
sector
and
earn
additional
hard
currency
revenues
that
russia
will
be
in
a
position
six
or
seven
years
from
now
to
pay
back
those
loans
q
substantial
governmenttogovernment
loan
weve
ever
gotten
into
with
the
russians
senior
administration
official
i
dont
want
to
answer
authoritatively
on
that
i
dont
go
back
or
years
on
this
but
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
yes
it
is
because
the
previous
way
that
we
financed
grain
exports
was
really
to
just
ensure
private
bank
loans
this
is
a
different
type
of
effort
q
government
loans
in
any
other
sector
that
you
recall
i
know
it
wasnt
done
in

think
its

i
would
like
to
go
on
record
as
objecting
to
mr
hentrich
calling
himself
an
aryan
the
word
aryan
is
of
sanskrit
origin
and
occurs
first
in
the
hindu
scripture
the
rigveda
it
seems
to
have
been
a
tribal
term
but
may
have
had
connotations
of
good
character
such
connotations
are
quite
explicit
in
the
sayings
of
the
buddha
who
called
his
religion
the
eightfold
aryan
path
the
word
was
borrowed
by
the
german
scholar
max
mueller
who
used
it
as
a
synonym
for
indoeuropean
but
then
the
nazis
proceeded
to
steal
it
and
started
pretending
that
aryan
is
synonymous
with
nordic
which
seems
highly
unlikely
the
people
who
originally
called
themselves
aryas
the
iranians
noprth
indians
the
afghans
and
possibly
the
kurds
are
none
of
them
nordic
so
the
use
of
the
word
by
westerners
though
meant
with
apparent
good
humor
in
this
case
is
nontheless
inappropriate
the
only
westerners
who
may
have
some
claim
to
call
themselves
aryans
by
descent
are
the
celts
who
seem
to
have
wor
shipped
a
god
called
aryaman
who
is
mentioned
in
the
rigveda
if
you
want
to
check
what
i
am
saying
look
at
mallorys
book
in
search
of
the
indoeuropeans
or
just
look
at
the
encyclopedia
britannica
the
reason
this
usage
is
offensive
is
that
most
of
ancient
indian
literature
as
well
as
religion
is
directly
or
inderectly
due
to
the
aryans
and
for
westerners
to
butt
in
is
really
not
nice
not
to
mention
the
horrible
things
done
by
germans
to
jews
using
a
word
to
which
the
germans
have
no
clear

yes
a

however
as
a
side
note
i
think
that
the
prohibition
on

mandates
that
the

be
tried
on
all
those
charges
at

trying

whos
already
been

arising
from

i
think
that
this
is
double

but
apparently
the
courts
dont
agree
with
me
note
that
the
laws
that
dont
agree

protect
a

couldnt
get

specifically
civil

workers
in

in

the

supersedes

up

you
pays
your
money
and
you
takes
your

me
i
lean
strongly
towards
the
against
argument
i
know
that
having
the
law
treat
everyone
as
equals
regardless
of
realities
will
not
in
and
of
itself
lead
to
true
equality
and
in
fact
may
lead
at
times
towards
greater
inequality
nonetheless
i
believe
that
true
equality
is
at
least
possible
when
the
laws
treat
people
as
being
equal
while
true
equality
is
by
definition
impossible
when
the
laws

mandate
unequal
treatment
of

anatole
france
said
the
law
in
its
impartial
majesty
forbids
the
rich
as
well
as
the
poor
from
sleeping
under
bridges
equality
of
law
can
be
construed
in
any
number
of
ways
for
example
the
fact
that
all
property
thefts
regardless
of
value
are
not
punished
equally
is
an
inequality
which
protects
those
who
have
a
lot
of
money
from
having
it
stolen
you
could
easily
define
equality
to
regard
the
property
in
terms
of
its
significance
for
the
owner
this
would
a
form
of
equality
that
would
be
skewed
toward
poorer
people
in
fact
most
antigay
bashing
laws
are
constructed
to
offer
equal
protection
they
make
it
an
offense
to
damage
people
based
on
a
motivation
of
hatred
for
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
in
its

protects
hets
as
well
as

you
still

not
answered
what
you
mean

please
do
so
i
would
suggest
that
legal
precedent
defines
a
human
being
ie
a
person
whose
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
as
someone
with
a
functioning
brain
could
you
cite
some
of
those
precedents
for
me
or
the
basis
of
this
definition
while
the
law
does
allow
the
removal
of
extraordinary
means
of
sustaining
life
in
cases
of
brain
death
this
in
itself
does
not
lead
to
your
conclusion
of
how
the
law
defines
a
human
being
however
at
least
you
defined
human
being
in
a
tenuous
fashion
that
is
a
person
whose
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
for
my
answer
to
your
question
i
refer
you
to
roe
v
wade
and
subsequent
supreme
court
decisions
which
define
to
what
extent
a
fetus
is
protected
by
the
constitution
and
the
law
certain
judges
have
concurred
that
slavery
is
not
a
violation
of
human
rights
therefore
it
is
not
you
wont
answer
the
question
and
instead
drag
in
irrelevancies
if
you
want
a
definition
of
human
being
that
does
not
depend
on
the
vagaries
of
law
but
holds
solid
whatever
the
law
may
rule
provide
it
for
me
i
would
suggest
that
your
blind
faith
would
not
likely
hold
up
if
the
shoe
were
on
the
other
foot
the
brain
lifedeath
paradigm
is
one
that
i
suggest
as
one
consistent
with
other
legal
definitions
it
clearly
doesnt
matter
to
you
whether
an
unborn
child
has
any
rights
or
not
however
so
the
point
is
lost
on
you
more
irrelevancies
as
larry
margolis
pointed
out
the
law
has
made
special
exceptions
in
order
to
include
fetuses
but
does
not
follow
your
version
of
human
being
and
as
he
pointed
out
brain
death
is
not
a
means
of
determining
who
has
the
rights
of
the
living
but
rather
who
has
died
there
is
a
significant
difference
what
i
am
wondering
now
is
has
your
argument
so
failed
you
that
you
feel
it
necessary
to
drag
out
irrelevancies
and
leave
the
thread
you
started
you
got
answers
to
your
questions
when
you
began
baiting
me
if
you
recall
after
you
had
made
some
ridiculous
remarks
about
adrienne
regard
and
having
been
corrected
changed
the
subject
with
your
remarks
about
having
a
discussion
of
substance
if
you
really
wanted
a
discussion
of
substance
why
then
do
you
disregard
logic
and
substance
in
order
to
toss
silly
accussations
eg
it
really
doesnt
matter
to
you
if
it
matters
to
you
then
why
not
define
human
being
and
seek
some
substance
youre
not
going
to
convince
a
logical
person
of
the
rightness
of
your
position
unless
you
apply
some
logic
and
show
some
meaning
to
your
words
if
she
is
then
why
does
the
mother
have
the
right
to
kill
her
when
she
is
in
the
womb
but
not
after
she
has
passed
through
the
birth
canal
because
a
woman
has
a
right
to
have
any
object
which
threatens
her
health
and
is
within
the
confines
of
her
body
removed
the
other
side
of
the
argument
would
give
rights
to
the
fetus
that
would
not
be
granted
to
an
adult
human
if
for
example
you
were
occupying
the
body
of
another
for
whatever
reason
or
through
whatever
means
the
reason
and
means
being
irrelevant
that
other
would
be
able
to
remove
or
have
you
removed
if
that
removal
required
your
demise
i
see
no
reason
in
law
that
such
a
removal
could
not
be
effected
rather
than
examining
a
hypothetical
thought
experiment
let
us
examine
a
real
though
rare
situation
siamese
twins
if
one
siamese
twin
has
the
other
surgically
removed
knowing
that
it
will
cause
death
and
barring
some
emergency
where
they
will
both
die
anyway
it
is
murder
is
it
have
you
any
support
for
this
assertion
furthermore
your
analogy
is
completely
inapplicable
siamese
twins
have
an
equal
claim
to
any
body
parts
they
have
in
common
try
again
what
establishes
this
equal
claim
beyond
your
assertion
if
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
which
came
first
cannot
one
kill
the
other
since
they
both
have
equal
claim
what
if
one
has
more
motor
control
than
the
other
does
that
establish
a
superior
claim
as
others
point
out
one
is
sacrificed
for
the
other
depending
on
which
has
the
better
chance
at
survival
again
your
analogy
fails
not
precedence
but
possession
makes
a
difference
here
a
womans
womb
is
indisputably
her
own
also
i
see
you
ignore
my
statement
that
you
would
grant
rights
to
a
fetus
that
would
not
be
granted
a
born
human
being
was
that
due
to
its
inconvenience
you
see
the
right
to
life
is
granted
to
adult
humans
in
the
same
sense
as
it
should
be
to
the
foetus
at
some
point
prior
to
birth
are
siamese
twins
ever
separated
in
the
womb
or
is
this
right
you
assert
for
siamese
twins
which
i
dont
even
think
is
true
as
stated
or
valid
as
an
analogy
one
that
exists
after
birth
freivald
your
entire
argument
here
is
a
failure
interesting
way
of
trying
to
combine
two
essentially
orthogonal
concepts
the
point
is
that
it
is
murder
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
regardless
of
their
status
of
physiological
dependence
or
interdependence
is
it
please
cite
a
precedent
and
the
basis
of
the
ruling
it
would
be
difficult
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
inside
the
womb
and
even
if
it
were
possible
i
doubt
that
a
case
could
be
made
for
premeditation
or
neglegence
note
the
use
of
the
phrase
it
should
be
in
my
post
you
simply
assert
things
without
any
support
your
analogy
is
not
accurate
and
your
assertions
are
unsupported
try
this
on
for
size
it
is
not
murder
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
there
we
now
have
equal
arguments
but
the
idea
is
illogical
for
one
siamese
twin
to
kill
the
other
in
the
womb
would
likely
be
to
kill
itself
as
well
the
systems
are
dependent
on
each
other
for
life
im
still
struggling
to
see
anything
analagous
here
and
failing
to
do
so
of
course
the
situation
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
it
may
well
be
that
one
siamese
twin
deliberately
initiates
oppression
or
coersion
against
the
other
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
with
an
unborn
child
and
this
last
statement
from
you
is
a
total
non
sequitur
the
comparison
is
far
worse
than
you
give
it
credit
for
are
you
going
to
let
this
assertion
stand
on
its
own
also
or
do
you
plan
on
following
up
with
a
reasoned
argument
your
argument
is
from
fantasy
island
your
comparison
is
a
total
failure
as
i
have
demonstrated
already
and
has
no
basis
in
reality
neither
legally
nor
medically
and
for
you
to
assert
that
it
is
not
a
perfect
comparison
because
of
the
impossible
that
of
coercion
or
oppression
is
ridiculous
as
i
said
you
give
the
analogy
too
little
credit
for
failure
on
the
one
hand
you
start
this
by
saying
you
want
to
take
a
real
rather
than
a
hypothetical
situation
then
you
fly
off
into
siamese
twins
murdering
one
another
in
the
womb
or
coercing
or
oppressing
each
other
in
the
womb
when
the
reality
of
the
situation
you
describe
in
now
way
matches
your
version
as
i
said
before
decisions
are
made
regarding
which
twin
lives
and
dies
in
situations
where
they
cannot
both
survive
and
furthermore
as
i
have
already
said
there
is
a
difference
between
an
equal
claim
to
organs
and
a
claim
that
is
unequal
you
seem
to
be
asserting
that
a
fetus
has
a
claim
on
a
womans
womb
when
the
fetus
is
born
what
happens
to
its
claim
and
by
what
reason
do
you
assert
its
claim
if
a
parent
has
the
right
to
choose
to
not
take
responsibility
for
their
own
child
why
are
there
laws
and
penalties
against
child
abandonment
this
last
question
is
irrelevant
and
something
of
a
non
sequitur
can
you
establish
some
relevance
or
even
some
sense
for
it
if
at
some
point
an
unborn
child
is
a
human
being
the
parents
clearly
have
the
same
responsibilities
toward
her
as
any
other
parents
have
toward
their
children
again
what
is
the
relevance
you
have
established
no
sense
of
when
that
point
is
you
ignore
the
significant
difference
between
a
fetus
and
a
born
child
the
dependence
of
a
born
child
can
be
transferred
to
another
party
while
that
of
a
fetus
cannot
a
born
child
does
not
live
within
the
body
of
another
human
being
while
a
fetus
does
thereby
representing
potential
and
often
actual
harm
to
that
body
as
in
the
case
of
one
of
our
talkabortion
participants
who
suffers
from
epilepsy
and
to
whom
pregnancy
represents
a
significant
health
risk
or
as
in
the
case
of
a
woman
i
know
who
chose
to
continue
her
pregnancy
but
spent
her
entire
pregnancy
confined
to
a
wheelchair
and
suffering
great
pain
from
constriction
of
some
nerve
and
your
argument
is
not
an
argument
against
abortion
generally
but
at
best
an
argument
against
abortion
at
some
time
during
the
course
of
pregnancy
again
a
quest
for
common
ground
most
of
the
prochoice
people
i
have
spoken
to
in
person
none
of
them
proabortion
activists
concede
that
the
child
has
a
right
to
life
at
some
point
that
supersedes
all
of
the
mothers
rights
except
that
of
her
own
life
as
is
often
the
case
in
emotionally
charged
issues
the
activists
have
a
very
different
outlook
from
the
mainstream
you
havent
answered
the
question
the
situations
are
not
analagous
the
dependence
of
a
born
child
is
not
transferred
instantaneously
it
takes
time
and
effort
incidentally
it
is
the
prochoice
side
not
me
arguing
that
the
government
should
make
it
easy
for
parents
to
abandon
their
children
to
the
state
again
you
avoid
the
question
dependence
can
be
transferred
and
it
is
not
as
slow
as
you
seem
to
think
as
to
the
anecdotal
evidence
of
real
human
tragedy
there
is
ample
on
both
sides
i
would
hate
to
be
in
the
position
of
the
mother
in
nyc
who
has
to
tell
her
daughter
that
she
lost
her

id
hate
to
have

the
one
to
tell
dr

is

i

i

to

this

the

subtle
for

in
the
one
case
you
do
not

you

you
cant

are

you
are

about

ask
any

she

did
drinks

etc
she
behaves
very
differently
and
the
provision

than
the

prolifers

it
is

brain
death
is
a
method

a

theres
no

i

it
you
may
object
to

but
it
would
make

subject
re

hate
crimes
laws
in
article
said
this
sort
of
separate
treatment
by
the
law
has
no
place
in
an
equal
society
the
solution
to
the
fact
that
some
classes
are
more
vulnerable
to
attack
or
discrimination
is
to
do
what
has
always
been
done
in
response
to
imbalances
in
criminal
activity
and
citizen
protection
to
allocate
law
enforcement
resources
to
more
efficiently
and
effectively
deal
with
the
problems
not
to
rewrite
the
law
itself
wdstarr
so
how
do
you
feel
about
increased
penalties
for
killing
a
policeman
a
federal
employee
or
to
use
both
scalias
and
stevenss
example
increased
penalties
for
threatening
the
president
im
assuming
that
like
all
good
people
you
oppose
the
marital
exemption
for
rape
so
i
wont
bring
that
up
in
order
of
your
questions
i
oppose
it
i
oppose
it
i
oppose
it
and
huh
wha
where
did
that
topic
come
from
and
whats
it
got
to
do
with
the
discussion
at
hand
when
i
was
discussing
the
concept
of
different
criminal
laws
for
crimes
against
different
classes
of
people
and
yes
i
do
consider
laws
which
allowmandate
enhanced
penalties
following
conviction
based
upon
the
convicts
attitudes
towards
the
class
membership
of
the
victim
to
fit
into
that
category
the
category
of
classes
i
had
in
mind
was
that
of
the
standard
civil
rights
discussion
classes
based
upon
race
gender
ethnicity
religion
sexual
orientation
etc
having
you
ask
about
classes
based
upon
ones
profession
rather
than
ones
personal
characteristics
caught
me
off
guard
and
i
had
to
think
out
the
question
from
scratch
what
i
finally
decided
was
that
the
law
should
not
recognize
such
classes
because
to
do
so
would
be
to
formally
and
officially
declare
some
people
to
be
of
more
worth
than
others
and
that
would
be
anathema
to
the
underlying
american
concept
of
equal
treatment
under
the
law
last
year
when
a
federal
crime
bill
was
under
consideration
which
would
have
expanded
the
federal
death
penalty
to
an
additional
fiftyplus
crimes
including
the
murder
of
various
federal
officers
hitherto
not
protected
by
that
aura
of
deterrence
critics
pointed
out
the
absurdity
of
having
laws
which
made
the
death
penalty
available
for
the
murder
of
a
federal
postal
inspector
but
not
for
ther
murder
of
a
civilian
teacher
when
the
latter
arguably
provided
a
much
more
valueable
service
and
therefore
would
be
the
greater
loss
to
society
this
was
an
emotionally
compelling
argument
but
even
the
proponents
of
that
viewpoint
appeared
to
tacitly
assume
that
the
state
should
judge
some
lives
as
being
more
valuable
than
others
on
the
basis
of
their
contribution
to
society
i
view
that
doctrine
as
being
both
a
personally
repugnant
and
b
repugnant
to
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
amendment
accordingly
i
believe
that
there
should
be
no
laws
which
give
any
professionbased
class
of
people
special
protection
via
the
mechanism
of
supplying
stronger
statutory
deterrence
of
crimes
against
members
of
that
class
not
even
police

way

to

the

along
with
all

the

has
done
they
have
also

every

has
its

it
seems
to
me
that
the

must
be
extremely
ignorant
to
qualify

the

if
youre
not

and
western

are

things
that
look

ya

in

by

although
many
of

have
not

with
their

im
sure
most
of
us
have
been
at

somewhat
interested
in
them
i
for
one
am
greatful
to

i
thought
in

country
where
people
like
mr

are
allowed
to
say
what
they
please
if
i
dont
want
to
read
it
i
can
just
skip
on

or
unsuscribe
but
unfortunately
some
people
cannot
let
others
live
and
let
live
they
feel
an
overwhelming
need
to
snuff
out
the
little
bastards
now
it
seems
that
mr

will
be
with
us
no
more
due
mainly
to
our

well

well
thanks
to
eckpanixcom
mark
eckenwiler
and
ted
frank
my
account
is
to
be
axed
i
guess
that
the
information
i
am
presenting
is
just
toooo
difficult
for
them
to
deal
with
they
only
ted
and
mark
have
complained
to
my
sysadmin
some
unknown
number
of
times
to
get
me
off
the
net
in
his
defense
mark
sent
only
one
message
and
it
was
not
that
bad
it
has
been
posted
in
one
of
the
newsgroups
however
it
was
not
directed
at
me
as
would
be
common
practice
and
i
am
very
good
at
responding
via
netmail
while
i
disagree
with
ted
i
would
not
send
mail
to
his
sysadmin
to
get
him
axed
namecalling
was
not
enough
jumping
on
every
post
i
made
was
not
enough
ignoring
specific
points
when
they
were
not
what
the
desired
picture
was
not
enough
simply
ignoring
me
if
i
am
such
a
kook
was
not
enough
even
now
i
do
not
wish
to
have
him
axed
but
i
do
wish
to
express
my
disgust
about
this
argumentum
ad
silenceyouropponentum
i
would
have
thought
he
would
have
wanted
me
to
stay
around
just
to
have
someone
to
yell
about
and
seem
sooo
wise
to
himself
i
think
the
issue
that
seems
to
be
is
the
following
an
advertisement
apparently
ted
and
mark
think
so
i
posted
an
article
from
around
one
year
ago
as
it
was
taken
off
the
net
from
last
year
if
reposting
an
article
constitutes
posting
an
ad
then
i
am
guilty
this
post
did
have
a
name
and
address
and
yes
a
price
if
one
had
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
of
newsweek
would
that
be
an
ad
i
get
nothing
from
showing
this
stuff
i
posted
a
list
of
documents
showing
examples
of
the
kind
of
proof
that
was
requested
by
ted
frank
he
then
complains
to
my
sysadmin
saying
that
i
am
advertising
and
lo
and
behold
poof
there
goes
my
account
this
one
had
an
address
in
it
oh
no
i
guess
that
means
it
is
an
ad
if
you
value
the
alternative
view
i
have
been
discussing
or
value
its
discussion
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
it
i
ask
that
you
send
a
note
saying
as
much
to
me
to
show
to
the
sysadmin
they
rarely
get
ya
know
that
user
on
your
net
was
real
helpful
or
whatever
they
only
get
i
dont
like
what
that
user
is
doing
because
please
do
not
send
the
note
to
the
sysadmin
i
need
to
take
it
to
them
in
a
manner
that
has
at
least
a
chance
of
getting
through
in
my
files
here
are
hundreds
of
responses
from
people
saying
thanks
for
the
info
or
could
you
send
me
such
and
such
or
your
posts
are
very
interesting
keep
it
up
and
only
a
handfull
of
go
aways
but
i
guess
the
fact
that
i
have
decided
not
to
waste
my
time
trying
to
convince
ted
is
a
net
offensetm
of
such
magnitude
as
to
warrant
a
message
complaining
about
me
knock
knockmy
name
is
ted
and
and
this
is
mark
were
from
the
thought
police
seems
you
have
some
pretty
dangerous
ideas
here
and
were
here
to
confiscate
them
nwo
indeed
guess
i
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
come
up
with
a
new
plan
thanks
ted
and
mike
hope
you
are
happy
i
will
be
on
for
a
few
more
days
and
then
thats
all
folks
your
comments
and
support
are
requested
i
can
no
longer
post
to
news
i
ask
what
this
has
accomplished
is
there
some
benefit
from
making
alternative
views
simply
vanish
not
in
my
book
seems
the
easiest
way
to
win
an
argument
is
to
make
the
opposing
side
shut
up
images
of
waco
ah
but
alas
and
all
this
when
i
am
in
the
process
of
typing
in
a
letter
to
me
from
the
tax
collector
saying
that
a
lien
was
removed
due
to
a
letter
that
i
wrote
challenging
jurisdiction
oh
well
it
takes
time
to
come
up
with
the
info
requested
and
i
was
just
getting
started
it
should
be
noted
that
ted
frank
has
been
accused
publicly
over
times
of
being
an
nwo
supporter
and
has
never
made
an
statements
to
the
contrary
further
what
are
ted
franks
motivations
for
getting
me
axed
we
all
know
that
some
people
are
getting
paid
to
collect
info
on
people
on
the
net
that
are
of
interest
to
the
government
and
ted
sure
seems
to
have
a
personal
interest
in
debunking
me
hmmm
just
who
does
he
work
for
the
university
of
chicago
which
he
attends
is
well
known
as
one
of
the
biggest
nwo
supporters
and
finally
if
anyone
would
be
able
to
help
me
find
a
new
account
here
in
the
boulderdenver
area
i
would
greatly
appreciate
it
i
am
in
the
process
of
installing
linux
and
so
will
be
able
to
do
uucp
or
maybe
a

any
help
here
would
be
greatly
appreciated
since
i
am
longer
be
able
to
post
news
and
will
no
longer
have

editors
note
the
reason
for
posting
the

lines
from
the

was
to
show
what
the
problem
was
and
hopefully
correct
it
ted

its
inexcusable
to
post
lines
of

a

would
have
been
sufficient
resolution
lazlo
yes
i
agree
but
our
policy
is
to
not
watch

someone

makes
we
generally
let
the
net
itself
take
care
of
inappropriate

flaming
the

which
i
assume
this
is

to
be
we

dont

in
this
stuff
unless
its
illegal
repetitive
posts
of

harassment
or
something
else
that
offends
the
community
in
general
my
suggestion
is
that
you
take
it
to
email
and
explain
what
a
post
for
bounces
should
look
like
or
tell
him
to

editors
note
obviously
ted

no
such

his

is

sound

it

fine
if
you

please
prevent
a

question
dont
just
reassert
your
opening
statement
for
those
in
the
dark
i
wrote
to
teels
sysadmin
noting
that
a
he
wastes
bandwidth
by
posting
identical
messages
long
ones
to
several
newsgroups
independently
instead
of
crossposting
and
b
he
has
improperly
used
his
posts
to
advertise
goods
for
sale
a
i
was
requested
to
post
to
those
groups
and
they
were
getting
deleted
by
whom
b
the
goods
for
sale
was
a
method
of
showing
the
source
and
obtaining
further
info
and
the
message
in
question
was
retrieved
in
its
entirety
from
the
net
i
simply
reposted
it
from
one
year
ago
would
there
be
a
complaint
if
i
had
posted
an
article
from
newsweek
then
posted
the
address
and
subscription
price
how
about
the
subscription
info
for
the
american
law
review
bit
of
a
double
standard
yeah
think
so
no
indication
that
was
what
happened
until
now
editing
down
is
always
possible
readers
more
careful
than
aj
will
note
that
the
complaint
appended
below
expressly
disclaims
any
wish
to
suppress
teels
postings
merely
because
they
are
infantile
irrational
and
tedious
more
name
calling
mark
is
that
your
best
shot
oh
i
see
the
reason
for
your
sending
that
letter
had
nothing
to
do
with
your
opinion
of
my
information
right
clearly
your
motivations
were
the
best
interest
of
all
of
those
poor
users
who
could
not
speak
for
themselves
if
we
werent
talking

it
would
be
funny
further
your
perception
for
want
of
a
better
term
is
not
the

that
i

the

because
he
used

because
people

im
not
sure
if
you
meant
to
imply
that
or
not
but
i
just
thought
id
bring
that
up
hitler
became
chancellor
because
people
voted
for
his
political
party
thats
not
a
huge
difference
in
a
parliamentary
system
your
statement
is
a
common
misconception
but
it
just
isnt
true
in
the
german
weimar
system
the
chancellor
was
not
necessarily
the
leader
of
the
largest
reichstag
party
the
chancellor
was
appointed
by
the
president
and
generally
was
the
leader
of
a
coalition
of
parties
who
could
form
an
effective
majority
in
the
reichstag
beyond
that
the
implication
that
hitler
rose
to
the
chancellorship
because
a
majority
of
germans
wanted
nazi
rule
is
false
as
well
before
president
hindenburg
appointed
hitler
chancellor
in
january
the
german
people
did
not
show
a
particular
desire
to
be
led
either
by
hitler
or
by
the
nazi
party
these
are
the
results
of
the
march
election
for
president
the
closest
hitler
ever
came
to
direct
election
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
duesterberg
in
the
runoff
election
in
april
the
results
were
hindenburg
hitler
thaelmann
so
we
can
see
that
hitler
personally
was
supported
by
only
about
a
third
of
german
voters
similarly
the
nazi
party
never
received
more
than
of
the
vote
in
reichstag
elections
that
occurred
in
july
in
the
november
election
the
nazis
lost
two
million
votes
and
seats
down
from
to
out
of
the
in
the
reichstag
comparitively
the
socialists
had
and
the
communists
the
communists
had
gained
seats
and
the
german
national
party
which
had
supported
the
previous
government
had
picked
up
a
million
of
the
nazis
lost
votes
to
gain
seats
up
to
i
think
the
other
large
party
was
the
catholic
center
party
i
dont
know
how
many
seats
they
had
but
i
think
they
were
declining
and
there
were
numerous
other
small
parties
thus
the
nazi
vote
was
on
the
decline
at
the
time
hitler
was
appointed
chancellor
what
brought
hitler
to
power
was
not
the
demand
of
the
german
people
for
hitler
or
the
nazis
to
run
things
but
the
inability
of
the
other
parties
to
put
their
differences
behind
them
in
favor
of
forming
an
effective
government
for
the
country
germany
did
not
have
an
enduring
democratic
tradition
and
their
parliamentary
system
lacked
effective
center
parties
that
favored
the
interests
of
the
majority
of
the
population
instead
what
they
had
was
a
number
of
small
parties
who
were
unable
to
put
aside
their
own
specific
objectives
in
order
to
combine
against
the
nazis
who
were
out
to
end
the
democratic
process
in
fact
part
of
the
problem
was
that
some
of
the
other
parties
with
substantial
representation
like
the
communists
were
also
out
to
end
the
democratic
process
but
with
different
results
in
mind
and
generally
didnt
mind
seeing
parliamentary
democracy
go
under
germany
had
already
had
a
nonnazi
chancellor
with
a
majority
coalition
for
five
months
while
the
nazis
had
been
the
largest
reichstag
party
and
there
certainly
was
no
danger
of
a
revolution
in
favor
of
the
nazis
if
anything
the
nazis
were
starting
to
get
desperate
because
they
had
failed
to
get
enough
support
to
make
hitler
president
and
their
popular
vote
had
begun
to
decline
hitler
was
not
hindenburgs
first
choice
to
be
chancellor
not
even
his
second
choice
first
von
papen
had
been
chancellor
since
june
after
the
november
election
when
the
nazis
lost
seats
hindenburg
first
prevailed
on
von
papen
to
remain
as
chancellor
but
there
were
intrigues
behind
his
back
and
support
for
him
was
lacking
so
then
hindenburg
turned
to
von
schleicher
who
became
chancellor
for
two
months
eventually
he
too
was
unable
to
hold
together
a
working
coalition
of
parties
to
oppose
the
nazis
who
refused
to
participate
in
any
government
that
was
not
led
by
a
nazi
chancellor
some
of
the
nazi
leadership
particularly
gregor
strasser
who
was
the
man
in
the
party
at
the
time
wanted
to
participate
in
a
coalition
government
but
others
knowing
the
partys
support
was
waning
figured
that
their
best
hope
to
gain
power
lay
in
undermining
the
democratic
process
nevertheless
the
country
was
governed
for
seven
months
by
chancellors
who
were
not
nazis
even
though
the
nazis
were
the
largest
reichstag
party
the
failure
of
these
men
to
achieve
a
working
coalition
was
due
to
the
inability
of
their
coalition
parties
to
work
together
heres
how
william
shirer
puts
it
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
third
reich
the
cardinal
error
of
the
germans
who
opposed
nazism
was
their
failure
to
unite
against
it
at
the
crest
of
their
popular
strength
in
july
the
national
socialists
had
attained
but
percent
of
the
vote
but
the
percent
of
the
german
people
who
expressed
their
opposition
to
hitler
were
much
too
divided
and
shortsighted
to
combine
against
a
common
danger
which
they
must
have
known
would
overwhelm
them
unless
they
united
however
temporarily
to
stamp
it
out
true
the
german
people
supported
hitler
after
he
became
chancellor
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
there
was
not
overwhelming
support
for
him
before
he
was
in
power
the
german
people
were
not
crying
out
for
hitler
to
take
over
no
matter
how
bad
economic
conditions
were
the
leftist
parties
socialistscommunists
probably
had
more
support
in
total
than
the
nazis
hitler
used
the
fact
that
others
were
passively
or
actively
willing
to
see
the
government
paralyzed
as
a
means
to
taking

coming

i

if

there

many
russians
became
disillusioned

democracy
and
reforms
when
they
felt
rightly
imo
that
the
west
didnt
care
yeltsin
was
virtually
promised
massive
aid
once
bush
got
over
his
gorbymania
this
probably
kept
him
from
dismantling
the
congress
and
calling
for
new
elections
well
the
aid
didnt
come
through
and
we
didnt
make
sure
it
went
to
the
proper
places
and
now
the
antireformers
are
gaining
strength
where
before
they
were
in
hiding
have
you
considered
a
noninterventionist
policy
if
market
reform
does
happen
russia
will
certainly
get
private
capital
at
private
risk
to
help
their
economy
they
will
even
have
incentive
to
do
so
for
the
same
reason
if
they
dont
reform
then
our
government
will
probably
consider
them
enemies
anyway
and
rather
spend
money
to
hurt
rather
than
help
them
if
they
dont
reform
i
dont
believe
in
giving
them
money
however
i
think
this
is
too
important
to
take
a
noninterventionist
approach
this
is
what
really
bugs
me
about
libertarianism
it
sounds
like
itll
all
be
the
same
in
a
hundred
years
time
no
need
to
do
anything
how
does
this
affect
us
well
we
are
on
the
same
planet
and
if
vast
tracks
of

are
blown
away
i
think
wed
feel
something
a
massive
breakup
of
a
country
that
spans
the
planet
is
bound
to
have
affects
here
of
course
there
is
also
the
humanitarian
argument
that
democracies
should
help
other
democracies
or
struggling
democracies
if
a
billion
gift
was
that
important
to
our
well
being
couldnt
it
be
raised
voluntarilly
people
already
give
over
billion
a
year
to
charity
despite
the
wishes
of
libertarians
this
society
is
a
far
way
and
getting
farther
from
being
libertarian
perhaps
voluntary
gifts
would
work
if
we
had
the

we

i
think
limited
government
is
more
key
than
how
democratic
it
is
well
i
think
limited
government
is
primarily
democratic
due
to
it
being
limited
but
the
main
question
is
how
do
you
transform
a
staterun
economy
and
monolithic
government
into
something
that
even
remotely
looks
like
ours
btw
sometimes
it
seems
that
our
government
is
trying
to
go
the
opposite
direction
it
is
not
going
to
be
painless
and
not
going
to
be
easy
we
simply
cannot
wait
to
help
when
they
have
the
proper
government
theyll
never
get
there
without
the
aid
it
may
be
too
late
already
btw
who
is
to
decide
stupid
this
is
just
like
those
who
want
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
thought
libertarians
were
against
that
was
an
opinion
and
libertarians
are
very
big
on
free
speech
and
im
just
excercising
mine
actually
my
politics
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
and
this
is
why
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
join
the
party
it
seems
that
libertarians
want
to
withdraw
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
let
it
sink
or
swim
if
you
are
pretty
libertarian
except
on
this
one
issue
then
you
should
be
very
libertarian
consider
it
a
compromise
how
much
money
would
your
fellow
russiaaiders
have
to
give
to
russia
if
those
you
oppose
werent
using
the
same
government
machine
to
steal
money
from
you
and
your
group
for
causes
you
dont
support
as
i
also
said
above
another
problem
i
have
is
with
transformation
a
libertarian
society
is
not
going
to
happen
painlessly
or
overnight
i
have
seen
nothing
about
how
to
take
our
current
government
and
society
and
turn
it
into
a
minimal
government
and
a
responsible
selfsufficient
populace
we
could
do
that
years
ago
but
not
now
people
have
been
saying
that
for
hundreds
of
years
they
didnt
have
nuclear
weapons
years
ago
nor
instantaneous
communications
nor
travel
to
virtually
anyplace
on
the
earth
in
less
than
a
day
like
it
or
not
we
are
in
the
beginnings
of
a
global
economy
and
global
decision
making
all
the
more
reason
to
depend
on
the
free
market
which
can
more
efficiently
process
information
than
to
depend
on
rulers
for
decisions
on
complex
issues
yes
depend
on
the
rulers
of
the
free
market
and
the
businesses
rulers
do
emerge
somewhere
and
they
will
never
represent
the
opinions
of
every
person
on
the
planet
there
must
be
checks
and
balances
checks
on
the
government
when
it
gets
out
of
bounds
and
checks
on
industry
when
it
gets
out
of
bounds
putting
all

benevolence
of

is
to
me
just
like
putting

your

on
the
benevolence

it

at

how

firsti

we
took
that
for

the
generation
were
the
most
spoiled
and
irresponsible
the

had
create

fathers
that
were
determined

creating

consider
the
contrast
between

in

and
woodstock
which
group
had
large

that
could

themselves
and
reverted
to

level
of

defecation
in

no

so
we
ought

make
beating

more
illegal
than
beating
up
a
straight
silly
me
thinking
that
the
issue
was
that
we
are
all
people
to
be
treated
equally
thanks
for
straightening
me
out
wrong
if
a
bunch
of
faggots
from
the
tenderloin
decide
to
go
straight
bashing
and
they
selectively
target
a
heterosexual
man
and
beat
the
bloody
fuck
out
of
him
they
would
get
charged
as
well
under
all
the
federal
laws
that
exist
about
violation
of
civils
rights
the
focus
of
their
intent
is
his
sexual
orientation
and
so
the
law
applies
to
them
as
well
the
national
government
retains
the
right
to
make
any
laws
necessary
to
sufficiently
deter
and
punish
any
crime
against
someones
civil
rights
until
that
behavior
becomes
so
well
punished
that
nobody
even
tries
it
the
fact
is
that
at
last
count
gays
were
not
beating
straights
for
their
sexual
orientation
thus
the
law
is
getting
applied
only
to
the
straights
who
indulge
themselves
the
federal
government
or
judiciary
has
the
right
to
enforce
the
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
under
law
even
if
it
takes
possible
charges
against
people
who
would
violate
them
go
read
your
constitutional
law
we
broke
the
back
of
the
kkks
harrassment
campaign
with
the
same
strategy
in
the
early
so
many
went
to
jail
and
for
so
long
that
it
cut
the
heart
out
of
the
kkk
rsw
no
it
is
not
double
jeopardy
a
single
act
may
lead
to
multiple
charges
and
multiple
crimes
i
think
what
you
meant
to
say
here
was
with
the
current
mutation
of
the
us
constitution
under
the
current
police
state
someone
may
be
charged
multiple
times
for
one
act
if
the
victim
in
question
is
of
the
right
shade
a
single
act
should
never
merit
more
than
on
charge
thats
almost
like
if
four
cops
got
acquitted
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
charges
and
the
country
went
and
tried
them
again
and
again
until
they
oh
never
mind
this
mutation
as
you
call
it
protects
your
little
butt
too
if
you
happen
to
be
somewhere
where
youre
the
wrong
shade
for
somebody
elses
taste
if
it
can
be
shown
that
the
motive
for
the
assault
on
you
was
racially
motivated
then
the
full
power
of
these
extra
laws
that
bring
more
charges
and
punishments
will
come
against
those
who
harmed
you
the
first
use
of
such
laws
was
well
over
a
hundred
years
ago
and
constitutional
scholars
of
all
conviction
recognize
that
this
right
reserved
to
the
federal

is
well
established
and
not

some
shortlived
peculiarity

lib

these
views
dmeiercasbahacnsnwuedu
you
know
i
have
thought
about
the
issue
of
if
someone
beats
up
a
homosexual
or
a
black
person
etc
should
the
crime
be
specified
as
something
special
shit
beating
up
anybody
regardless
of
race
and
sexual
orientation
should
be
a
very
serious
crime
if
you
pick
out
those
crimes
which
are
committed
against
the
opposite
sex
different
race
or
a
different
sexual
orientation
is
this
a
form
of
favoring
those
groups
over
other
groups
hmm
i
mean
i
think
that
a
crime
committed
against
all
people
should
be
treated
the
same
but
i
know
that
there
are
many
people
out
there
who
are
very
prejudice
against
people
who
are
different
than
they
are
and
perhaps
hate
crimes
laws
are
the
only
way
to
punish
the
bastards
appropriately
but
why
should
a
person
who
commits
a
crime
against
a
wealthy
protestant
white
by
a
wealthy
protestant
white
be
treated
on
a
lower
level
isnt
this
discrimination
against
the
wealthy
white
person
hmm
any
input
out
there
as
a
black
person
i
here
about
all
sorts
of
stories
where
fellow
blacks
are
persecuted
and
beat
up
because
of
their
race
this
really
tears
me
up
but
a
crime
against
a
white
by
a
white
should
also
be
treated
as
a
heinous
crime
please
respond
i
would
like

hear
what

views
are

ciao
mimi
the
federal
government
has
used
such
laws
to
allow
mutliple
charges
in
order
to
prevent
more
crimes
than
would
nromally
occur
just
from
two
people
being
pissed
off
at
each
other
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
the
intent
of
the
perpetrators
in
the
pursuit
of
preventing
violations
of
civil
rights
its
the
way
they
broke
the
back
of
the
klan
by
putting
a
lot
of
people
away
for
a
very
long
time
for
harrassing
blacks
specifically
it
is
a
principle
that
has
been
well
recognized
as
constitutionally
valid
since
over
years
ago
it
has
been
used
whenever
a
select
group
was
getting
bashed
or
harrassed
more
than
any
other
person
would
just
for
being
part
of
a
minority
it
is
the
only
way
we
made
the
defeat
of
the
south
stick
after
the
civil
war
people
who
harrassed
free
blacks
when
normally
they
wouldnt
find
themselves
harrassing
just
anyone
walking
around
were
expeditiously
tried
and
jailed
for
to
years
until
nobody
wanted
to
try
it
anymore
now
with
the
amendment
guarantee
of
equal
protection
under
the
law
the
law
can
use
multiple
crime
and
severe
penalty
involving
intent
as
much
as
is
needed
to
protect
even
one
human
that
is
a
hated
minority
to
somebody
they
can
call
out
the
national
guard
just
for
them
as
they
did
the
school
girls
in
alabama
during
desegregation
in
the
and
the
president
can
nationalize
the
state
militia
and
turn
the
guns
of
the
militia
that
were
being
used
to
bar
blacks
right
around
to
point
at
the
thousands
in
the
crowd
with
an
order
to
shoot
that
they
would
have
to
obey
or
face
possible
death
by
firing
squad
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
for
failing
to
obey

they
did
those
southern
boys
turned

around

i
think
thats
appropriate
to
mention
at
the
beginning
of
this
meeting

he
has
been
of
course
a
person
who
has
been
one
that
weve
all
followed
in
terms
of
our
democracy
and
the
importance
of
education
here
in
this
great
country
the
success
of
our
democracy
according
to
jefferson
really
depends
upon
the
success
of
our
educational
system
his
philosophy
of
government
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
education
is
also

commerce
to
support
the
effort
that
the
chamber
is
making
along
with
its
center
for
work
force
preparation
to
help
to
examine
tonight
the
whole
critical
question
of
how
to
move
our
young
people
from
school
to
the
work
place
i
want
to
compliment
the
chamber
on
all
their
efforts
recognizing
that
without
an
educated
work
force
we
cant
grow
this
economy
or
remain
competitive
and
recognizing
that
we
all
have
to
work
together
business
and
government
labor
and
educators
to
make
things
happen
this
satellite
town
meeting
is
a
good
example
of
that
kind
of
working
together
and
if
youll
forgive
me
a
little
home
state
pride
i
want
to
say
a
special
word
of
thanks
to
the
walmart
corporation
headquartered
in
bentonville
arkansas
for
providing
several
hundred
of
the
sites
for
this
town
meeting
tonight
i
appreciate
that
a
lot
as
well
as
the
sites
that
are
provided
for
all
the
rest
of
you
i
have
tried
as
hard
as
i
could
to
move
toward
constructive
change
for
this
country
secretary
riley
talked
about
this
being
thomas
jeffersons
birthday
if
thomas
jefferson
believed
in
anything
he
believed
in
these
three
things
first
in
education
second
in
real
personal
liberty
freedom
of
religion
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
association
freedom
of
the
press
and
third
in
the
absolute
imperative
of
changing
as
times
change
if
you
go
to
the
jefferson
memorial
here
in
this
beautiful
city
which
is
now
bedecked
with
all
of
its
wonderful
cherry
blossoms
you
will
see
jefferson
saying
that
we
have
to
change
with
changing
times
for
us
here
in
america
that
means
reducing
our
deficit
and
increasing
our
investment
and
putting
our
people
first
so
that
we
can
compete
in
the
world
were
here
to
talk
about
that
tonight
about
what
we
can
do
to
educate
and
train
our
people
better
unless
we
do
that
none
of
the
efforts
that
all
the
rest
of
us
make
in
government
even
to
bring
the
budget
into
balance
even
to
increase
our
investment
in
other
things
which
will
grow
jobs
will
last
in
the
long
run
we
also
have
to
have
people
who
can
carry
their
load
and
in
a
world
where
the
average
young
person
will
change
jobs
seven
or
eight
times
in
a
lifetime
that
begins
with
the
education
system
and
continues
into
the
work
force
where
education
must
go
on
for
a
lifetime
its
not
just
important
what
you
know
but
what
you
can
learn
and
if
i
might
id
like
to
close
just
by
emphasizing
were
doing
our
best
to
try
to
have
the
most
innovative
partnership
between
the
labor
department
and
the
education
department
and
the
private
sector
to
build
a
good
schooltowork
transition
and
were
trying
to
get
off
to
a
good
start
this
summer
with
a
program
that
would
create
more
than
new
summer
jobs
including
many
thousands
that
have
a
strong
education
component
so
our
young
people
can
be
learning
and
working
at
the
same
time
dick
i
think
i
ought
to
stop
there
thats
a
good
place
we
can
begin
i
think
the
discussion
secretary
riley
thank
you
so
much
mr
president
each
month
we
get
together
and
talk
about
ways
that
all
citizens
can
work
towards
reaching
the
national
education
goals
and
tonight
well
focus
on
goal
five
and
how
communities
such
as
yours
can
prepare
students
for
this
world
of
work
this
week
the
education
department
and
the
labor
department
are
hosting
a
conference
here
in
washington
dc
called
summer
challenge
a
program
of
work
and
learning
to
americas
youth
the
aim
is
to
use
some
special
funds
from
president
clintons
proposed
economic
stimulus
package
to
provide
educationallyenriched
jobs
and
summer
school
programs
for
young
people
in
disadvantaged
areas
of
the
country
mr
president
lets
talk
a
minute
you
alluded
to
it
somewhat
about
the
summer
youth
challenge
your
program
calls
for
more
educational
enrichment
in
the
summer
jobs
and
why
in
your
words
is
that
so
important
the
president
i
think
its
important
for
two
reasons
first
of
all
a
lot
of
the
young
people
were
trying
to
reach
may
have
had
trouble
adjusting
to
school
and
learning
and
while
we
want
them
to
have
a
good
experience
with
a
real
job
we
also
want
them
to
continue
to
learn
during
the
summer
because
we
know
from
a
lot
of
research
that
a
lot
of
kids
that
have
trouble
learning
in
school
may
forget
as
much
as
percent
of
what
they
learned
the
previous
year
over
the
summertime
and
that
is
a
very
unproductive
thing
for
schools
to
have
to
take
up
a
lot
of
time
teaching
what
they
already
taught
before
secondly
we
want
to
help
these
young
people
progress
not
only
in
terms
of
work
but
in
terms
of
learning
we
want
to
abolish
the
artificial
dividing
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learning
because
we
think
that
the
best
and
most
productive
workers
will
have
to
be
lifetime
learners
and
we
think
that
this
experience
could
maybe
drive
that
point
home
and
prepare
these
young
people
to
succeed
in
school
or
at
work
or
in
college
as
they
go
on
secretary
riley
well
i
think
the
fact
that
these
are
disadvantaged
kids
that
gap
that
lag
you
mentioned
as
they
go
into
the
next
year
is
really
even
greater
secretary
reich
of
course
you
have
training
programs
throughout
the
year
and
i
wonder
is
you
have
any
comment
about
this
educational
component
of
training
secretary
reich
well
what
weve
learned
mr
secretary
is
that
for
many
young
people
whether
its
for
the
summer
or
for
the
year
actually
onthejob
work
experience
combined
with
education
is
one
of
the
best
ways
of
learning
many
young
people
for
example
have
a
lot
they
have
a
difficult
time
learning
geometry
but
when
they
actually
are
there
building
something
or
working
on
something
and
they
can
see
the
exact
and
direct
application
of
geometry
they
understand
what
its
used
for
and
a
lot
of
young
people
just
that
sense
of
connection
between
education
and
the
world
of
work
is
terribly
terribly
important
its
important
during
the
summer
but
its
important
for
a
lot
of
young
people
even
beyond
the
summer
secretary
riley
thank
you
mr
president
youve
called
for
a
youth
apprenticeship
program
schooltowork
transition
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
your
concept
of
that
and
how
you
see
it
developing
the
president
well
first
of
all
lets
talk
about
why
its
important
most
new
jobs
that
will
be
created
in
this
decade
will
not
require
a
fouryear
college
degree
but
most
of
them
will
require
some
learning
and
skills
that
go
well
beyond
what
most
people
get
in
a
high
school
diploma
if
you
look
at
the
last
years
the
average
salaries
of
young
people
that
had
at
least
two
years
of
good
posthigh
school
education
was
a
good
salary
that
went
up
over
the
decade
the
young
people
who
had
less
than
that
tended
to
have
lower
wages
that
did
not
go
up
and
in
many
cases
in
real
terms
fell
over
the
decade
because
they
werent
productive
they
werent
more
valuable
to
their
employers
so
we
think
america
has
a
big
economic
interest
in
trying
to
ensure
that
all
the
young
people
who
get
out
of
high
school
but
dont
go
on
to
college
make
a
transition
to
work
which
includes
two
years
of
further
training
either
in
a
community
college
a
vocational
setting
or
perhaps
on
the
job
and
what
i
have
done
in
this
budget
as
you
know
is
to
give
you
and
secretary
reich
some
funds
and
some
incentives
to
try
to
work
in
partnership
with
states
and
with
the
private
sector
to
build
these
programs
statebystate
in
a
way
that
would
be
customized
essentially
by
the
business
community
based
on
the
needs
of
the
economy
in
any
given
area
it
could
revolutionize
longterm
the
quality
of
the
american
work
force
and
the
earnings
of
american
workers
secretary
reich
i
should
add
mr
president
i
think
you
know
this
from
your
experience
in
arkansas
and
many
of
the
people
watching
this
program
that
the
business
community
and
educators
labor
groups
are
already
in
many
of
our
communities
many
of
our
states
building
a
schooltowork
transition
program
in
fact
theres
an
awful
lot
of
ferment
a
lot
of
excitement
the
people
watching
this
program
probably
are
the
ones
who
are
most
directly
involved
in
that
and
more
power
to
them
secretary
riley
and
i
are
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
build
on
the
successes
already
out
there
secretary
riley
bob
were
going
to
be
talking
tonight
about
youth
apprenticeship
and
tech
prep
the
coop
learning
career
academies
and
what
features
all
those
programs
that
deal
with
this
subject
what
are
some
of
the
features
that
every
one
of
these
schooltowork
programs
might
have
that
are
important
secretary
reich
well
one
thing
that
weve
seen
and
you
and
i
have
been
working
at
this
for
a
long
time
and
you
much
longer
than
i
weve
seen
that
active
involvement
of
the
business
community
is
absolutely
essential
and
im
so
delighted
that
were
doing
this
in
the
headquarters
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
the
united
states
is
committed
to
doing
these
kinds
of
programs
training
education
retraining
and
weve
aimed
to
work
very
closely
with
the
chamber
the
business
community
is
going
to
be
actively
engaged
in
developing
almost
an
audit
of
the
kind
of
jobs
that
are
needed
and
helping
the
educators
community
colleges
technical
institutions
develop
curricula
that
are
relevant
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
communities
have
got
to
come
together
i
mean
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
youve
got
to
have
all
of
these
players
in
a
community
come
together
and
work
together
and
cooperate
together
you
know
too
often
we
have
the
educators
over
here
and
the
business
leaders
over
here
labor
groups
over
here
and
everybody
is
talking
but
theyre
not
really
working
together
in
a
common
strategy
and
the
third
and
final
ingredient
i
would
say
dick
would
be
a
commitment
to
excellence
a
commitment
both
to
academic
excellence
and
also
to
skills
development
excellence
this
is
not
a
tracking
program
were
talking
about
for
kids
who
are
not
going
to
make
it
this
is
a
program
that
every
young
person
ought
to
be
eligible
for
if
they
want
to
go
on
beyond
that
to
fouryear
college
thats
fine
that
ought
to
be
permissible
but
were
talking
about
the
foundation
of
learning
about
jobs
the
foundation
skills
for
onthejob
learning
and
again
those
are
the
critical
components
its
already
being
done
the
president
i
think
if
i
might
just
interject
one
point
based
on
my
personal
experience
at
home
the
business
community
has
a
critical
role
to
play
not
simply
in
saying
here
are
the
job
skills
that
are
needed
and
heres
what
ought
to
be
taught
but
also
in
monitoring
that
excellence
if
you
have
the
right
sort
of
partnership
there
the
people
who
are
paying
the
taxes
and
who
are
going
to
then
be
hiring
the
workers
are
not
going
to
permit
the
secondrate
programs
to
survive
if
they
have
any
way
to
shape
and
influence
them
so
i
think
thats
very
important
and
when
we
try
to
if
you
will
fill
in
the
blanks
at
the
federal
level
trying
to
set
some
standards
and
provide
some
funds
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
be
sure
and
do
is
to
make
sure
that
the
employer
has
a
heavy
amount
of
influence
over
the
quality
of
these
programs
because
thats
really
whats
going
to
determine
whether
the
whole
thing
is
worthwhile
secretary
riley
thats
great
weve
been
talking
of
course
about
schooltowork
and
also
the
jobs
and
economic
recovery
program
for
this
summer
and
fall
but
lets
talk
just
a
moment
about
longterm
school
reform
its
something
especially
close
to
me
mr
president
i
wonder
if
you
would
give
us
some
of
your
ideas
for
the
communities
out
here
on
goals
legislation
that
i
think
will
be
coming
forth
before
too
long
the
president
well
as
you
know
back
when
you
and
i
were
both
governors
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
working
on
our
public
schools
and
we
tried
to
be
very
candid
with
our
people
in
saying
that
a
lot
of
these
things
were
going
to
take
some
time
to
materialize
i
had
a
hand
in
writing
the
national
education
goals
that
the
governors
drafted
along
with
representatives
of
president
bushs
administration
back
in
and
what
were
going
to
try
to
do
this
year
with
your
leadership
is
to
introduce
legislation
in
congress
that
will
actually
define
the
things
that
the
national
government
ought
to
do
to
try
to
help
the
local
schools
and
the
children
of
this
country
and
the
adult
learners
too
meet
those
goals
making
sure
that
when
by
people
show
up
for
school
ready
to
learn
that
we
get
a
percent
ontime
high
school
graduation
rate
that
children
at
the
and
grades
are
confident
in
the
subjects
theyre
supposed
to
know
that
they
are
second
to
none
in
math
and
science
that
are
schools
are
safe
disciplined
and
drugfree
and
of
course
the
fifth
goal
i
took
them
out
of
line
to
say
this
the
last
is
that
we
have
a
system
of
lifelong
learning
in
this
country
and
each
one
of
those
goals
theres
a
national
role
a
state
role
a
school
role
school
district
role
and
a
private
sector
role
and
what
youve
attempted
to
do
in
this
bill
youre
going
to
introduce
with
me
in
the
next
few
weeks
is
to
define
what
our
job
is
and
then
to
give
the
rest
of
america
a
way
of
defining
what
their
job
is
and
seeing
whether
were
actually
meeting
the
standards
of
quality
that
we
need
to
meet
its
very
exciting
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
quite
like
it
has
ever
been
done
in
the
form
of
federal
legislation
before
not
mandating
and
telling
people
what
they
have
to
do
with
their
money
but
actually
setting
up
a
framework
for
excellence
and
partnerships
so
that
we
can
do
our
job
im
really
excited
about
it
secretary
riley
well
i
am
too
and
i
think
really
it
will
be
an
entirely
new
role
for
the
federal
government
in
terms
of
its
relationship
with
states
serving
as
a
partner
really
to
support
and
facilitate
and
to
help
out
in
these
education
reform
efforts
all
driven
by
high
standards
thats
the
point
bob
let
me
ask
you
one
question
and
then
well
get
to
the
telephone
calls
its
about
the
same
subject
we
have
of
course
skills
standards
that
are
going
to
be
part
of
goals
and
i
wonder
if
you
would
comment
on
that
secretary
reich
well
you
know
we
have
percent
of
our
young
people
who
dont
graduate
from
college
very
often
they
dont
have
very
many
alternatives
they
do
have
a
wonderful
system
of
community
colleges
and
technical
institutions
but
if
we
had
national
skill
standards
to
which
they
could
aspire
and
which
employers
would
understand
as
a
national
credential
many
of
these
young
people
would
actually
find
that
they
were
much
more
eligible
for
jobs
everybody
doesnt
have
to
go
to
college
other
countries
you
have
smaller
proportions
of
their
population
going
to
college
but
you
have
a
whole
level
of
people
who
have
certain
technical
preprofessional
skills
we
can
do
it
in
this
country
if
you
dont
go
to
fouryear
college
youre
not
a
loser
and
we
want
to
develop
those
national
skill
standards
were
going
to
be
working
with
the
states
with
the
education
department
with
a
lot
of
private
industry
in
developing
those
standards
and
i
think
they
will
be
the
kinds
of
things
that
enable
our
vocational
and
technical
and
other
institutions
to
rally
around
as
well
as
our
business
community
secretary
riley
well
thats
great
why
dont
we
go
ahead
and
go
to
the
telephone
we
have
a
call
i
see
mayor
bruce
todd
of
austin
texas
q
yes
mr
president
and
mr
secretary
reich
and
riley
we
certainly
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
join
you
today
we
have
some
dedicated
professionals
and
volunteers
here
in
austin
who
have
heard
what
you
have
said
and
are
very
appreciative
let
me
simply
say
amen
to
some
of
the
comments
made
already
we
agree
with
much
of
the
tone
that
the
clinton
administration
has
taken
and
are
very
supportive
we
have
been
successful
here
in
austin
of
tripling
our
summer
employment
program
over
the
last
four
years
we
expect
to
have
over
employed
this
year
in
the
summertime
perhaps
as
much
as
with
the
federal
assistance
much
of
the
question
that
we
had
designed
you
have
answered
in
your
opening
comments
so
we
must
be
thinking
alike
but
the
question
essentially
involved
what
initiatives
after
labor
day
would
be
appropriate
we
know
summertime
is
important
yearround
is
even
more
important
and
what
kind
of
initiatives
at
the
federal
level
might
be
proposed
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
youth
on
a
year
round
basis
and
perhaps
more
importantly
how
can
families
and
the
local
community
be
more
involved
using
the
federal
initiative
thats
something
that
we
believe
is
very
important
to
success
in
this
effort
secretary
riley
mr
president
the
president
i
think
ill
give
everybody
a
chance
to
answer
the
question
bruce
but
let
me
first
thank
you
for
calling
and
thank
you
for
all
the
great
work
that
youre
doing
in
austin
ive
seen
some
of
it
and
ive
always
been
very
impressed
first
with
regard
to
the
summer
program
we
hope
we
can
structure
it
in
a
way
that
will
enable
us
to
continue
the
summer
program
and
that
will
move
a
lot
of
these
young
people
back
into
schools
under
circumstances
that
might
allow
them
to
do
some
work
in
the
private
sector
too
we
hope
that
secretary
reich
is
going
to
try
to
set
up
a
system
where
we
create
a
lot
of
private
sector
jobs
to
be
matched
with
the
public
sector
jobs
this
summer
and
were
working
on
that
secondly
in
the
program
that
i
have
presented
to
the
congress
over
the
next
five
years
what
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
to
build
in
an
amount
of
investment
thats
quite
substantial
for
job
training
programs
for
schooltowork
programs
all
of
which
give
heavy
heavy
weight
to
local
community
input
just
the
question
you
asked
but
do
provide
some
federal
investment
dollars
which
we
hope
you
can
put
with
local
dollars
to
keep
people
working
and
being
trained
on
a
yearround
basis
and
i
will
say
again
to
echo
what
secretary
reich
said
a
moment
ago
to
try
to
break
down
the
barrier
between
what
is
seen
as
work
and
what
is
seen
as
learning
an
awful
lot
of
young
people
actually
have
quite
high
iqs
but
actually
learn
so
much
better
when
theyre
doing
than
when
theyre
reading
or
just
listening
so
we
hope
that
the
community
involvement
part
of
it
will
be
permanent
and
we
hope
that
if
the
whole
budget
passes
and
we
do
have
budget
cuts
and
more
than
actually
in
the
budget
and
some
revenue
raisers
and
some
new
money
for
education
and
training
that
well
be
able
to
do
just
what
you
seem
to
want
based
on
your
question
bob
do
you
want
to
say
anything
secretary
reich
well
you
took
most
of
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
mr
president
as
usual
but
let
me
just
add
one
thing
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
posthigh
school
for
a
lot
of
young
people
who
are
not
going
on
to
college
in
addition
to
the
schooltowork
program
simply
is
the
availability
of
jobs
and
weve
got
to
get
this
economy
moving
again
obviously
its
terribly
important
to
get
this
recovery
program
to
get
the
economy
back
on
track
thats
sort
of
the
prerequisite
to
everything
else
if
we
dont
get
the
economy
back
on
track
we
have
i
think
this
is
the
correct
me
if
im
wrong
mr
president
i
think
is
the
month
we
have
had
seven
percent
unemployment
or
greater
this
is
a
jobless
recovery
a
lot
of
those
kids
are
going
to
be
getting
out
of
school
in
june
and
even
if
we
did
everything
right
they
would
have
a
very
very
hard
time
getting
jobs
secretary
riley
thank
you
both
of
course
goals
will
be
a
permanent
longterm
thing
that
will
certainly
reach
into
next
year
it
will
involve
if
passed
and
we
certainly
hope
it
will
be
action
plans
with
every
state
where
we
can
be
working
together
to
reach
for
the
goals
in
a
number
of
different
ways
and
then
the
state
with
all
the
various
school
districts
a
very
important
part
of
that
will
be
citizen
and
parent
involvement
and
i
think
everybody
will
see
a
great
energy
out
there
once
we
get
that
moving
the
next
call
is
dr
harry
heinemann
new
york
doctor
q
good
evening
mr
secretary
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
on
with
you
this
evening
as
you
may
know
bridging
the
school
and
work
has
been
central
to
la
guardias
educational
program
since
its
inception
in
the
and
that
includes
the
college
the
two
alternative
high
schools
that
operate
on
our
campus
and
the
linkages
we
have
forged
with
the
local
schools
we
have
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
effective
learning
strategy
and
over
the
years
weve
come
to
believe
that
there
are
several
principles
that
are
very
important
in
bridging
the
school
and
work
and
these
include
integrating
theory
in
the
classroom
with
practice
in
the
workplace
with
providing
all
students
early
exposure
to
careers
as
well
as
providing
opportunities
for
them
to
reflect
upon
these
experiences
while
they
strengthen
their
skills
and
lastly
the
critical
role
of
the
liberal
arts
particularly
in
the
development
of
high
performance
competencies
my
question
then
is
how
can
the
general
education
faculty
and
the
academic
curriculum
be
more
closely
integrated
with
transition
to
work
experience
and
what
mechanisms
and
strategies
can
you
suggest
to
achieve
this
integration
secretary
riley
well
thank
you
very
much
i
think
and
well
get
a
response
from
you
all
on
that
and
very
interesting
work
going
on
there
were
going
to
have
three
people
our
next
guests
on
the
program
this
evening
that
will
be
some
specialists
in
that
area
that
youre
speaking
and
ill
certainly
pass
that
on
to
them
and
we
can
discuss
it
later
you
all
care
to
comment
any
comments
you
might
have
the
president
id
just
like
to
say
if
i
might
one
thing
i
want
to
reemphasize
this
and
i
dont
think
im
being
as
clear
about
it
as
id
like
although
i
think
at
least
one
of
the
people
who
will
be
on
the
second
panel
will
be
able
to
say
it
more
explicitly
than
i
i
think
this
whole
concept
of
applied
academics
is
very
important
and
i
think
that
we
have
to
basically
abolish
what
i
consider
to
be
a
very
artificial
distinction
between
what
is
vocational
learning
and
what
is
academic
learning
i
think
we
should
keep
the
liberal
arts
going
i
think
we
should
have
a
strong
component
for
people
who
are
in
the
vocational
program
secretary
reich
it
seems
to
me
that
we
also
need
to
rethink
our
entire
tracking
system
because
a
lot
of
these
school
and
work
combinations
are
important
for
mainstream
students
theyre
important
for
all
students
its
not
just
a
special
group
of
students
that
needs
them
some
of
the
experiments
that
ive
seen
around
the
united
states
dick
im
sure
youve
seen
them
as
well
are
mainstream
experiments
theyre
mainstreaming
all
the
students
at
and
grades
theyre
giving
them
a
combined
work
and
school
experience
and
then
a
transition
program
and
again
the
kids
can
either
go
on
to
college
if
they
want
they
can
go
on
to
technical
community
they
can
go
on
to
an
entirely
a
large
variety
of
possibilities
and
career
directions
but
we
have
to
get
away
from
the
stigmatizing
that
often
goes
on
with
young
people
who
simply
are
doing
jobrelated
or
work
related
work
within
the
classroom
within
our
schools
secretary
riley
thank
you
very
much
i
think
thats
going
to
be
the
last
call
that
we
have
time
for
mr
president
i
think
youve
got
to
move
on
to
another
matter
and
i
want
to
thank
you
and
secretary
reich
for
being
here
we
appreciate
your
time
and
your
ideas
and
its
been
a
tremendous
help
to
us
pm

of

and
if
youll

a

i
want
to
say
a
special
word
of
thanks
to
the
walmart

headquartered
in

for
providing
several
hundred
of
the

for
this

procedural
note
ted

while
i
respect
his
right
to

so
my
own
opinions
are
that
followupto
fields
are
mere
suggestions
not
mandatory
commands
and
this
issue
is
of
sufficient
a
general
political
relevance
and
b
civil
liberties
interest
to
warrant
keeping
it
active
in
tpm
and
ascl
as
well
at
least
for
this
round
in
article
said
uh
no
thats
not
what
happened
in
boomer
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
and
required
the
plant
to
pay
the
plaintiffs
the
to
make
them
whole
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
okay
now
heres
my
interpretation
of
boomer
based
on
the
facts
as
presented
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
holding
boomer
v
note
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
the
highest
court
in
new
york
state
while
the
united
states
and
of
the
fifty
states
call
their
highest
court
supreme
court
supreme
judicial
court
or
supreme
court
of
appeals
maryland
and
new
york
call
theirs
simply
the
court
of
appeals
to
make
matters
worse
new
york
also
calls
its
secondhighest
court
the
supreme
court
appellate
division
atlantic
cement
co
oscar
h
boomer
et
al
owned
land
near
the
atlantic
cement
companys
plant
near
albany
ny
the
fact
pattern
gives
no
information
as
to
which
came
first
the
plaintiffs
acquisition
of
the
land
or
he
defendants
start
of
production
at
their
cement
plant
in
the
course
of
its
regular
operations
the
cement
plant
did
injury
to
the
plaintiffs
property
via
dirt
smoke
and
vibrations
emanating
from
the
plant
the
plaintiffs
sought
injunctive
relief
that
is
they
asked
the
court
to
order
atlantic
cement
to
stop
damaging
their
property
commentary
this
seems
entirely
reasonable
to
me
boomer
at
al
owned
their
property
and
presumably
a
right
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
it
atlantic
cements
actions
were
depriving
boomer
et
al
of
that
right
instead
of
granting
the
plaintiffs
request
for
an
injunction
the
court
ordered
them
to
accept
the
damage
being
done
to
their
property
provided
that
atlantic
cement
paid
them
in
compensatory
damages
in
other
words
the
court
granted
atlantic
cement
co
a
private
party
the
power
and
authority
to
take
the
plaintiffs
rights
to
quiet
enjoyment
of
their
property
by
eminent
domain
a
taking
by
eminent
domain
is
always
problematical
even
when
its
done
by
the
state
allowing
a
private
firm
to
do
it
is
in
my
opinion
totally
wrong
yes
i
know
the
boomer
court
didnt
call
it
eminent
domain
but
if
it
walks
like
eminent
domain
and
swims
like
eminent
domain
and
quacks
like
eminent
domain
let
me
take
issue
with
the
way
youve
presented
the
case
you
say
that
what
happened
in
boomer
was
that
the
judge
didnt
allow
the
plaintiffs
to
blackmail
the
cement
plant
by
demanding
a
multimillion
dollar
plant
to
be
shut
down
over
in
damages
blackmail
pulls
out
blacks
law
dictionary
abridged
edition
blackmail
unlawful
demand
of
money
or
property
under
threat
to
do
bodily
harm
to
injure
property
to
accuse
of
crime
or
to
expose
disgraceful
defects
this
crime
is
commonly
included
under
extortion
statutes
how
do
you
define
as
blackmail
one
partys
act
of
demanding
the
right
to
set
its
own
sale
price
for
a
unique
piece
of
property
which
it
owns
and
which
another
party
has
expressed
an
interest
in
buying
or
of
demanding
the
right
not
to
sell
that
property
at
any
price
as
i
see
it
boomer
et
al
having
found
themselves
in
the
fortunate
position
of
owning
something
which
atlantic
cement
had
to
purchase
if
it
wanted
to
stay
in
business
had
every
right
in
the
world
to
set
whatever
price
they
wanted
there
isnt
or
at
least
shouldnt
be
any
law
that
says
that
you
have
to
be
a
nice
guy
in
your
private
business
dealings
you
go
on
to
say
the
plant
would
never
have
been
shut
down
the
plaintiffs
lawyers
would
have
just
negotiated
a
windfall
settlement
because
the
plaintiffs
would
prefer
an
amount
greater
than
to
having
the
plant
shut
down
while
the
plant
would
prefer
any
amount
less
than
the
value
of
the
plant
to
have
the
plant
continue
in
operation
if
so
so
what
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
preventing
parties
from
reaping
windfall
settlements
from
other
parties
when
those
settlements
arise
from
wrongful
acts
by
those
other
parties
if
atlantic
cement
didnt
want
to
have
to
face
a
choice
between
paying
a
windfall
settlement
or
going
out
of
business
well
shouldnt
atlantic
cement
have
thought
of
that
before
going
into
business
i
note
that
as
far
as
the
facts
show
boomer
et
al
were
not
the
parties
responsible
for
bringing
about
this
situation
that
was
atlantic
cements
own
fault
for
choosing
to
build
and
operate
the
type
of
plant
they
did
where
and
when
they
did
and
then
you
say
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
as
above
i
dispute
your
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
deprived
of
their
rights
as
owners
of
property
to
choose
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
property
at
a
price
acceptable
to
them
and
for
that
deprivation
they
were
not
made
whole
and
again
i
ask
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
avoided
if
so
ive
been
miseducated
i
always
thought
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
justice
is
done
is
boomer
really
being
taught
as
infamous
thats
really
sad
if
it
is
because
i
fail
to
see
how
its
less
than
completely
sensible
you
should
read
the
law
and
economics
stuff
firsthand
instead
of
filtered
through
teachers
who
clearly
dont
like
it
for
whatever
inexplicable
reasons
boomer
is
not
being
taught
as
infamous
at
least
not
at
my
school
aside
northeastern
law
usually
does
a
very
good
job
of
hiring
for
their
firstyear
mandatory
classes
such
as
torts
where
i
first
encountered
boomer
instructors
who
regardless
of
their
personal
opinions
can
and
do
teach
the
law
neutrally
when
the
students
get
into
their
second
and
third
years
in
which
the
students
a
can
pick
and
choose
which
courses
to
take
except
for
the
mandatory
professional
responsibility
of
course
and
b
are
presumed
to
be
a
bit
more
worldly
and
selfconfident
less
likely
to
be
consciously
or
subconsciously
intimidated
by
law
school
professors
and
able
to
learn
from
openly
biased
instructors
rather
than
be
indoctrinated
by
them
the
instructors
tend
to
be
more
open
in
expressing
their
own
opinions
this
is
especially
true
of
parttime
instructors
who
in
real
life
are
practicing
attorneys
or
sitting
judges
this
can
be
very

called

thats
my

ive
stated
above
i
believe
it
to
be
a
triumph
of
something
that
i
can
only
call
economic
correctness
over
justice
it
is
completely
sensible
only
if
you
believe
that
the
alleged
right
of
the
owners
of
atlantic
cement
to
stay
in
business
and
avoid
losing
a
lot
of
their
own
money
due
to
their
own
wrongful
act
and
the
alleged
right
of
several
hundred
atlantic
cement
employees
to
not
have
their
jobs
disappear
should
trump
the
rights
of
people
who
own
property
which
was
damaged
by
atlantic
cements
wrongful
acts
and
if
you
believe
that
it
is
correct
for
the
courts
or
any
other
branch
of

to
grant
to
private
parties
the
right

and
is
the
endall
and
beall
when
posner
says
precisely
the
opposite
so
it
goes
ive
admitted
that
my
understanding
of
the
field
generally
referred
to
as
law
and
economics
is
weak
if
it
advocates
the
use
of
economical
analysis
as
one
of
many
tiebreaker
factors
which
courts
may
use
to
help
them
reach
decisions
in
cases
in
which
the
dispute
as
measured
by
the
scale
of
justice
is
evenly
balanced
fine
but
as
illustrated
by
boomer
it
is
not
fine
when
the
courts
start
viewing
the
economics
of
a
case
as
being
more
important
than
the
justice
of
a
case

last
night
clinton
was
bashing
the
republicans
for
stonewalling
his
so
called
stimulus
package
it
seems
that
one
small
item
within
this
package
was
going
to
pay
for
free
immunizations
for
poor
kids
so
now
clinton
is
claiming
that
the
republicans
are
holding
the
health
of
poor
kids
hostage
for
blatantly
political
gains
aside
from
the
merits
or
lack
thereof
of
another
free
immunization
program
just
what
is
such
a
program
doing
in
a
bill
that
is
supposedly
about
creating
jobs
jobs
what
the
hell
have
jobs
to
do
with
it
its
another
touchyfeely
program
from
the
new
vapid
administration
the
fact
is
the
major
claim
made
for
universal
immunization
that
all
children
will
be
immunized
has
absolutely
no
validity
several
states
already
have
ui
programs
have
had
these
programs
for
years
the
result
on
average
their
success
rates
are
no
better
than
the
national
average
it
seems
that
the
gummint
hasnt
yet
figured
out
a
way
to
make
parents
bring
their
kids
in
yet
another
case
of
shameless
demagoguery
from
the
new
democrats
the
agents
of
change
if
clinton
is
so
hot
to
get
this
immunization
program
why
doesnt
he
and
the
democrats
just
introduce
it
as
a
stand
alone
bill
isnt
it
possible
that
clinton
is
the
one
doing
the
blatant
political
read
pork
manipulations
here
he
is
telling
the
republicans
pass
my
mutibillion
dollar
package
or
i
will
go
to
the
people
and
tell
them
that
you
are
opposed
to
immunizing
poor
kids
what
clinton
using
this
issue
for
partisan
gain
do
tell
i
have
never
thought
highly
of
clinton
but
stunts
like
this
lower
my
opinion
of
him
even
further
i
thought
one
of
clintons
campaign
themes
was
that
he
was
going
to
be
a
new
kind

this
kind

held

after

way
back
in
todays

is

about
the
document
that
held

used
without

the
document
which
was
discovered
in
the
archives
of
the
soviet
communist
party
in
moscow
is
a
russian
translation
of
what
is
described
as
a
september
report
prepared
for
the
vietnam
politburo
by
general
tran
van
quang
who
is
identified
as
the
deputy
chief
of

of

army
later
on

article
after
it
talks
about
the
claim
of
americans
in

vietnamese
prisons
phong
said
the
easiest
way
to
prove
that
the
document
is
a
fabrication
is
to
review
quangs
career
in
he
said
quang
was
not
deputy
chief

he
was
the

commander

in
an

one
of

would

there
are
ways
to
go
with
produced
things
the
first
is
to
trade
it
with
the
the
persons
who
produced
it
the
other
one
is
to
take
it
with
a
gun
from
the
person
who
produced
it
the
first
way
is
the
civilized
method
the
second
is
how
savages
arrange
their
affairs
the
american
indians
had
no
concept
of
ownership
of
property
and
often
freely
gave
of
their
supplies
to
neighboring
tribes
trading
food
and
clothing
for
weapons
or
services
the
native
hawaiians
like
their
polynesian
ancestors
also
could
not
conceive
of
that
idea
and
shared
many
things
with
the
other
islanders
in
fact
hiipoi

word

sharing

the
great

were

idea
in

villagers
will
often
share
tools

every

convincing
that

legalization
is
a
good
idea
even
such
a
noted
conservative
as
william
f

supports
it
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
your
examples
except
for
prostitution
fail
miserably
to
meet
both
criteria
safer
and
cheaper
obviously
killing
people
is
not
safe
as
for
prostitution
why
shouldnt
it
be
legal

didnt
the

had

not
all
the

im
curious
if
there
was
an
additional
level

made
by
the

states
to
rationalize
their
treatment
of

if
they
just
ignored
the
theoretical
problems
of
slave
ownership
the
bill
of
rights
as
far
as
i
can
see
does
not
once
refer
to
citizens

it
makes
several
references
to
people
for
example
article

the

article
viii
excessive

shall

nor

now
ive
never
heard
that
constitutional
rights
apply
only
to
citizens
arent
they
meant
to
apply
equally
to
all
persons
living
in
the
us
whether
slaves
were
considered
not
human
i
dont
know
but
it
seems
that
a
case
could
be
made
that
they
werent
treated
as
people
as
defined
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
since
the
nation
is
nominally
based
on
the
declaration
of
independence
which
states
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
it
would
also
seem
that
slaves
would
not
follow
under
this
definition

thomas

was
born
years

i
think
thats
appropriate
to
mention
at
the
beginning
of
this
meeting
because
since
that
time
he
has
been
of
course
a
person
who
has
been
one
that
weve
all
followed
in
terms
of
our
democracy
and
the
importance
of
education
here
in
this
great
country
the
success
of
our
democracy
according
to
jefferson
really
depends
upon
the
success
of
our
educational
system
i
wonder
if
he
realizes
the
irony
of
a
federal

invoking
a
rabid
antifederalist

when

you

how

have

abortion
in

ill

no
but
ive

the

it

worrisome
to
me
but
not
to
you
ive
been
reading
capolitics
for
a
while
now
and
i
dont
recall
seeing
such
a
comparison
you
dont
read
my
postings
very
carefully
im
not
surprised
it
was
pretty
shocking
and
is
part
of
why
my
sympathy
though
not
agreement
with
the
prolifers
is
increasing
a
handful
of
lunatic
opinions
expressed
in

does
not
make
me
think
that
the
opinion
is
widely
held
when
did
i
say
that
it
was
clayton
i
wish
i
knew
what
made
you
tick
your
math
sucks
and
you
take
single
instances
of
fringe
opinions
and
proclaim
the
existence
of
a
pernicious
trend
theres
about
a
quarter
billion
people
living
in
this

some
small
number
of
them
are
almost
guaranteed
to
hold
opinions
that
you
and
i
find
positively
repellent
as
long
as
the
small
number
is
truly
a
small
number
and
as
long
as
theyre
not
my
neighbor
highly
likely
im
not
worried
about
it
when
they
hold
high
public
office
you
should
worry
by
the
way
when
you
cite
experts
remember
that
carl

are

too
if

never

when

are

the
research
required
for

im
told
by
my

that
only
at
some
universities
is
publishing
the
primary
emphasis
many
professors
in
the
cal
state
university
system
dont
publish
at
all
those
that
prefer
teaching
are
under
no
pressure
to
publish
when
discussing
and
issue
it
helps
that
all
participants
use
the
same
definitions
although
this
rarely
occurs
on
usenet
when
i
use
the
term
university
i
think
of
an
organization
that
has
a
bachelors
masters

phd
program
i
believe
that
cal

do
not
i
call

are
universities
at

the
number
one
goal
is
to
publish

system
offers
bachlors
and
masters
degrees
the
phd
is
not
offered
because
of
opposition
from

do
the
professors
you
speak

have
phds
at
nearly
all
the

have

havent
had
a
professor
who
didnt
though
my
wife
has
had
a
couple
of
professors
with
just
an
ma
a
friend
had
an
instructor
who
didnt
have
a
degree
at
all
but
because
he
had
been
minister
of
culture
for
the
black
panthers
he
was
teaching
anyway
he
had
a
bad
habit
of
usually
not
showing
up
to
teach
the
class
and
finally
quit
in
disgust
at
the
racism
of
a
university
that
expected
him
to
show
up
to
teach
a
university
you
have
professors
with
phds
and
then
teaching

were

am

the
president
thank
you
very
much
the
speech
that
octavius
gave
says
more
than
anything
i
will
be
able
to
say
today
about
why
its
important
to
give
all
of
our
young
people
a
chance
to
get
a
work
experience
and
to
continue
to
learn
to
merge
the
nature
of
learning
and
work
why
its
important
to
honor
the
efforts
of
people
like
jerry
levin
and
nancye
combs
and
pat
irving
and
all
of
those
who
are
here
i
want
to
thank
the
secretaries
of
labor
and
education
and
all
the
people
who
work
with
them
for
sponsoring
this
and
my
good
friend
governor
wilder
for
being
here
and
for
speaking
and
all
of
the
business
and
local
community
leaders
from
the
city
and
county
and
state
level
from
around
america
who
are
here
this
has
been
a
pretty
fun
day
laughter
i
loved
hearing
the
young
people
sing
it
was
music
to
my
ears
because
it
is
their
future
that
we
are
really
struggling
about
applause
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
began
the
quest
to
seek
the
presidency
because
i
was
concerned
about
their
future
because
i
believe
that
our
country
which
had
always
been
a
beacon
of
hope
for
the
young
had
too
little
opportunity
was
too
divided
among
ourselves
across
lines
of
income
and
race
and
region
and
other
ways
without
a
vision
to
take
us
into
the
future
i
entered
with
the
hope
that
together
we
could
create
more
opportunity
and
insist
on
much
more
responsibility
from
all
of
our
people
but
in
the
process
we
might
recreate
the
best
of
americas
community
knowing
that
together
we
could
always
to
more
than
we
could
individually
and
that
we
might
secure
our
future
all
of
you
here
today
are
committed
to
that
the
jobs
that
jerry
levin
has
committed
timewarner
to
is
symbolic
of
the
commitments
made
by
many
of
the
private
sector
people
who
are
here
and
those
who
are
around
the
country
the
work
that
nancye
combs
does
and
the
successes
of
all
the
young
people
like
those
on
this
stage
and
especially
the
eloquent
statement
octavius
jeffers
all
those
things
show
that
together
we
know
what
we
need
to
do
and
were
on
the
right
track
last
july
when
i
was
traveling
across
americas
heartland
in
my
luxurious
bus
i
visited
seneca
high
school
in
louisville
kentucky
and
there
i
met
young
people
and
business
people
who
were
participating
in
the
louisville
education
and
employment
partnership
i
saw
what
nancye
combs
talked
about
today
i
saw
how
the
young
people
were
making
an
extra
effort
to
succeed
both
in
school
and
at
work
i
saw
as
i
have
seen
many
times
in
my
own
state
the
principle
illustrated
that
octavius
has
talked
about
that
for
millions
of
american
young
people
it
is
really
an
impediment
to
both
their
learning
and
their
ability
to
be
good
workers
to
draw
a
sharp
dividing
line
between
what
is
work
and
what
is
learning
in
the
world
in
which
we
are
living
the
average
young
person
will
change
the
nature
of
work
seven
or
eight
times
in
a
lifetime
we
must
learn
to
merge
the
work
world
and
the
learning
world
much
better
and
we
must
determine
that
all
of
our
young
people
see
the
opportunities
that
some
of
them
have
had
showcased
here
today
whether
youre
in
business
or
in
government
or
in
education
you
know
that
we
have
a
big
job
to
do
when
it
comes
to
building
a
future
that
really
honestly
includes
opportunity
for
all
of
our
people
there
are
still
a
lot
of
people
who
say
well
things
are
pretty
good
here
in
washington
and
everythings
fine
the
best
thing
we
can
do
about
this
whole
thing
is
nothing
they
all
have
jobs
laughter
all
the
people
who
say
that
applause
they
all
have
health
insurance
they
all
have
a
pretty
good
education
and
they
all
have
a
pretty
secure
knowledge
that
theyll
be
okay
no
matter
what
happens
i
say
that
not
to
be
either
political
or
unduly
critical
but
to
point
out
that
one
of
the
great
challenges
of
this
age
for
every
advanced
nation
everyone
is
to
fully
develop
the
capacities
of
all
of
its
people
and
then
find
work
for
them
to
do
all
the
european
countries
have
higher
unemployment
rates
than
we
do
but
also
stronger
support
systems
for
the
unemployed
the
japanese
unemployment
rate
has
been
going
up
theyre
going
to
adopt
a
stimulus
that
even
if
you
count
it
in
its
most
rigorous
terms
is
three
or
four
times
bigger
than
the
one
that
i
have
proposed
to
create
jobs
in
west
germany
alone
the
unemployment
rate
is
now
about
as
high
as
ours
this
is
a
big
problem
for
advanced
nations
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
to
add
an
extra
employee
with
a
lot
of
pressure
from
lowwage
producers
in
other
countries
that
are
growing
their
own
economies
and
trying
to
provide
new
opportunity
for
their
people
but
it
is
especially
important
for
america
for
two
reasons
one
is
we
have
a
whole
lot
of
folks
who
unless
we
move
aggressively
will
not
have
the
education
and
skills
we
need
to
be
competitive
and
productive
in
a
nation
like
this
the
second
is
even
if
we
educate
them
all
if
there
arent
jobs
they
will
be
robbed
of
the
fruits
of
their
educational
labors
people
need
to
be
able
to
work
in
this
country
applause
we
have
always
had
some
unemployment
and
indeed
some
of
it
is
normal
youve
always
got
some
people
leaving
jobs
and
moving
around
the
country
and
doing
first
one
thing
and
another
we
have
now
at
this
moment
in
our
history
the
necessity
for
all
big
organizations
including
the
government
to
reexamine
the
way
they
are
organized
and
who
ask
whether
there
are
too
many
people
working
at
some
kinds
of
jobs
but
in
the
whole
we
must
still
be
able
to
create
jobs
in
a
country
like
america
to
provide
people
with
the
chance
to
work
its
going
to
be
difficult
for
me
to
make
the
welfare
reform
proposals
that
i
will
make
to
congress
in
the
next
couple
of
months
its
going
to
be
hard
for
me
to
make
those
work
if
at
the
end
of
all
this
work
to
get
off
welfare
there
isnt
a
job
applause
so
we
have
two
tasks
one
is
to
develop
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
to
perform
without
regard
to
race
or
income
or
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
the
other
is
to
make
sure
that
there
are
some
opportunities
for
them
to
bring
to
bear
for
their
talent
and
to
be
rewarded
with
a
paycheck
it
is
a
great
challenge
i
do
not
pretend
that
all
of
the
answers
are
simple
but
i
know
if
you
want
to
ask
the
american
people
all
of
them
to
be
more
responsible
if
you
want
to
recreate
a
sense
of
community
in
this
country
that
bridges
the
lines
of
race
and
income
and
region
you
have
got
to
have
opportunity
in
that
mix
a
part
of
our
vision
for
america
has
to
be
a
future
for
every
young
person
in
this
country
whos
willing
to
play
by
the
rules
and
work
hard
and
strive
for
the
end
of
the
rainbow
there
has
to
be
something
at
the
end
of
that
rainbow
and
that
is
what
we
are
basically
here
to
talk
about
today
what
can
we
all
do
as
partners
recognizing
none
of
us
can
do
it
alone
to
develop
the
capacities
of
our
people
to
succeed
wherever
they
live
and
whatever
their
background
and
then
what
can
we
do
to
make
sure
that
theres
something
there
for
them
to
do
the
summer
jobs
program
were
discussing
today
is
an
integral
part
of
that
plan
because
it
will
promote
the
values
of
work
and
opportunity
and
fairness
community
it
will
put
the
people
first
and
it
does
have
a
partnership
between
the
public
and
private
sector
i
said
when
i
addressed
the
united
states
congress
in
february
on
this
program
that
i
would
seek
to
create
about
extra
summer
jobs
from
government
sources
and
then
challenge
the
american
business
community
to
meet
that
target
so
that
we
can
create
more
than
a
million
new
summer
jobs
over
and
above
what
had
been
created
before
many
many
people
have
responded
to
that
challenge
and
jerry
is
just
a
shining
example
of
that
which
has
been
replicated
in
this
room
and
around
the
country
people
who
are
going
to
do
more
than
they
otherwise
would
in
the
private
sector
to
give
young
people
a
work
experience
and
it
is
terribly
important
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
summer
jobs
program
is
part
of
an
overall
commitment
to
increase
the
capacity
of
the
american
people
from
retraining
defense
workers
who
lose
their
jobs
and
other
adults
who
need
to
acquire
new
skills
to
improving
the
transition
from
school
to
work
for
young
people
who
dont
go
to
college
but
do
need
at
least
two
years
of
posthigh
school
training
either
on
the
job
or
in
a
community
college
or
a
vocational
setting
so
that
they
can
be
competitive
workers
making
it
possible
for
more
people
to
go
on
to
college
who
do
want
to
go
all
these
things
are
part
and
parcel
of
a
comprehensive
plan
its
also
important
as
i
said
that
we
create
more
jobs
the
emergency
jobs
program
that
i
asked
the
congress
to
adopt
would
create
a
half
a
million
extra
jobs
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
and
that
would
reduce
the
unemployment
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
it
would
also
enable
us
to
absorb
more
young
people
coming
into
the
work
force
in
jobs
that
otherwise
will
not
be
created
it
also
will
help
a
lot
of
cities
and
counties
to
invest
in
things
that
need
to
be
done
at
the
grassroots
level
projects
long
delayed
water
projects
sewer
projects
park
projects
new
industries
and
particularly
in
small
and
mediumsize
communities
a
whole
range
of
things
that
will
improve
the
economy
and
improve
the
environment
the
summer
jobs
program
is
an
important
part
of
that
because
we
have
tried
for
the
first
time
through
the
work
of
the
labor
department
and
the
education
department
and
through
reaching
out
to
people
like
you
to
make
this
more
than
just
a
oneshot
summer
jobs
program
to
integrate
it
with
private
sector
efforts
to
hopefully
replicate
it
in
each
coming
summer
to
move
these
young
people
into
further
educational
opportunities
and
to
further
job
opportunities
and
to
have
a
strong
meaningful
education
component
to
these
summer
jobs
something
that
the
united
states
government
has
never
fully
emphasized
before
a
lot
of
these
young
people
as
you
well
know
because
they
come
from
difficult
backgrounds
because
they
go
to
school
in
difficult
and
challenging
circumstances
need
extra
help
in
building
their
basic
skills
in
math
and
language
reasoning
and
in
other
areas
and
a
lot
of
educational
studies
show
that
young
people
who
have
difficulty
in
school
often
forget
as
much
as
percent
of
what
they
learn
over
the
summer
and
then
that
has
to
be
repeated
the
next
year
what
we
are
trying
to
do
here
is
to
give
people
the
opportunity
to
learn
good
work
habits
and
to
reinforce
their
learning
skills
and
to
put
them
together
and
then
hopefully
over
the
next
couple
of
years
if
our
entire
program
passes
to
give
every
school
in
this
country
the
opportunity
to
have
a
good
work
and
learning
environment
there
will
be
more
applied
academics
more
opportunities
for
people
to
learn
and
work
during
the
school
year
so
that
this
will
not
simply
be
an
isolated
moment
for
these
young
folks
but
will
be
a
part
of
building
a
whole
new
educational
experience
a
whole
new
work
experience
and
moving
on
a
pathway
to
a
better
future
the
summer
jobs
programs
are
not
designed
to
be
make
work
jobs
theyre
designed
to
make
a
future
for
the
people
holding
the
job
and
thats
what
they
will
do
in
the
process
theyll
help
to
build
local
communities
to
strengthen
local
economies
to
solve
local
problems
real
jobs
renovating
housing
repairing
public
buildings
doing
clerical
work
providing
nursing
assistance
in
hospitals
supervising
and
training
children
at
child
care
centers
and
learning
all
the
way
challenging
young
people
to
learn
while
they
earn
but
letting
them
earn
you
know
its
very
difficult
to
make
a
case
to
people
who
have
never
seen
opportunity
on
their
own
street
that
they
should
do
this
that
or
the
other
thing
if
theres
no
evidence
of
the
opportunity
thats
at
the
end
of
the
effort
i
have
not
been
sparing
in
going
for
the
last
yearandahalf
into
places
where
it
isnt
exactly
popular
to
say
it
and
say
i
wanted
to
reform
the
welfare
system
i
wanted
to
toughen
child
support
i
wanted
to
require
people
to
work
i
was
sick
and
tired
of
people
being
irresponsible
in
the
use
of
guns
on
the
streets
and
i
wanted
to
change
all
that
but
if
youre
going
to
summon
people
to
greater
responsibility
you
have
to
reward
them
when
they
do
the
right
thing
with
opportunity
applause
the
young
people
we
propose
to
put
to
work
under
our
program
will
spend
hours
learning
basic
skills
such
as
math
reading
writing
either
on
the
job
in
the
classroom
they
will
stretch
their
minds
as
well
as
work
up
a
sweat
they
will
have
a
sense
of
accomplishment
it
will
literally
be
a
summer
challenge
but
a
challenge
that
will
take
them
into
a
different
life
so
i
want
to
ask
all
of
you
to
support
this
effort
even
as
i
as
your
president
support
your
effort
at
the
end
of
the
summer
we
will
evaluate
all
the
young
people
who
participate
well
see
whether
they
instead
of
falling
behind
over
the
summer
academically
as
too
many
young
people
do
they
stayed
even
or
moved
ahead
i
suspect
that
they
will
this
summer
secretary
reich
and
secretary
riley
and
i
will
be
visiting
many
of
your
communities
well
really
try
to
learn
from
you
which
of
these
efforts
are
working
what
we
should
do
next
summer
how
we
can
build
it
in
to
what
goes
on
during
the
school
year
how
we
can
build
in
our
job
training
efforts
and
the
works
that
we
do
with
your
companies
to
make
sense
of
this
whole
thing
so
that
we
maximize
the
impact
of
the
taxpayer
dollar
and
your
private
investments
as
well
we
want
to
honor
the
companies
and
the
communities
the
business
leaders
and
the
young
people
who
do
the
very
best
jobs
this
summer
and
again
i
want
to
say
to
all
of
you
in
private
business
who
have
matched
our
effort
i
thank
you
and
to
all
of
you
who
havent
and
those
across
the
country
who
may
listen
or
learn
about
this
event
today
i
want
to
implore
other
private
employers
to
stretch
a
little
bit
to
give
other
young
people
a
chance
to
work
this
summer
im
telling
you
we
cannot
go
through
another
years
when
we
dont
give
these
children
anything
to
say
yes
to
if
we
exhort
them
to
do
right
weve
got
to
be
able
to
reward
them
applause
when
the
other
speakers
were
talking
i
was
sitting
up
here
on
the
platform
listening
and
reveling
and
they
got
talking
about
work
and
i
got
to
thinking
about
all
the
different
things
ive
done
to
make
a
living
in
my
life
when
i
was
i
made
a
very
foolish
shortterm
business
investment
i
set
up
a
comic
book
stand
and
sold
two
trunks
full
of
comic
books
made
more
money
than
i
had
ever
had
in
my
life
but
if
i
had
saved
those
trunks
theyd
be
worth
today
laughter
that
does
not
mean
young
people
should
not
be
entrepreneurial
it
just
means
that
you
cant
foresee
a
generation
ahead
i
have
mowed
yards
and
cleared
land
and
built
houses
and
worked
in
body
shops
and
the
parts
departments
of
a
car
dealership
and
ive
done
a
lot
of
different
things
for
a
living
some
people
say
i
got
into
politics
to
escape
work
laughter
i
learned
something
from
every
job
i
ever
had
but
i
grew
up
in
a
generation
where
i
literally
did
not
know
a
living
soul
without
regard
to
race
or
income
who
wanted
to
work
who
didnt
have
a
job
i
grew
up
in
a
generation
when
all
you
had
to
really
say
to
people
is
get
an
education
and
youll
be
all
right
youll
get
a
job
and
youll
make
more
money
next
year
than
you
did
this
year
now
i
live
in
a
generation
full
of
people
most
of
whom
dont
make
any
more
money
in
real
dollars
than
they
did
years
ago
and
theyre
working
longer
hours
and
theyre
paying
more
for
the
basics
of
life
and
we
are
now
wondering
whether
we
can
create
the
jobs
that
these
young
people
want
now
i
want
to
close
by
reemphasizing
these
two
things
it
doesnt
matter
what
kind
of
economic
policies
this
administration
pursues
or
how
much
productivity
increases
there
are
in
the
private
sector
if
young
americans
dont
get
a
good
education
dont
learn
how
to
work
and
cant
be
productive
those
jobs
will
not
be
created
in
this
country
machines
will
do
the
work
or
the
work
will
be
done
offshore
by
people
who
have
the
same
skill
levels
and
can
work
for
a
third
or
a
fourth
or
a
fifth
the
wages
so
nothing
we
can
do
economically
will
matter
unless
we
build
the
skills
and
capacities
of
americas
work
force
and
anybody
that
pretends
otherwise
is
just
kidding
on
the
other
hand
we
need
to
be
honest
every
wealthy
country
in
the
world
including
the
united
states
is
having
difficulty
creating
jobs
if
i
knew
everything
that
needs
to
be
done
id
be
glad
to
tell
you
and
we
could
just
call
off
the
whole
deliberations
of
congress
and
everything
else
i
dont
have
all
the
answers
but
i
know
this
doing
nothing
is
not
the
answer
applause
and
so
the
jobs
program
that
i
have
presented
to
congress
with
the
summer
jobs
with
the
money
for
the
cities
and
the
counties
through
the
community
development
program
with
the
infrastructure
money
is
a
small
part
of
a
big
budget
it
is
an
attempt
to
engage
in
an
experiment
to
see
whether
or
not
with
the
economy
recovering
in
terms
of
corporate
profit
we
can
give
a
little
boost
to
it
give
opportunities
to
young
people
create
a
half
a
million
jobs
and
maybe
get
the
engine
going
again
most
of
the
jobs
in
this
program
are
going
to
be
jobs
in
the
private
sector
not
government
jobs
even
though
its
government
money
and
the
lions
share
of
the
work
in
rebuilding
the
american
economy
obviously
will
come
from
the
private
sector
thats
the
kind
of
system
we
have
and
it
works
pretty
well
but
this
is
the
challenge
we
have
so
i
ask
all
of
you
here
today
to
support
the
summer
jobs
program
to
ask
your
friends
and
neighbors
to
support
it
to
go
back
home
and
ask
your
employers
to
make
a
little
extra
effort
to
do
what
you
can
to
help
me
pass
the
funds
to
create
the
jobs
that
the
united
states
government
should
create
this
summer
so
that
together
we
can
have
this
partnership
because
more
than
anything
else
we
have
to
give
a
future
a
future
that
our
young
people
can
believe
in
we
need
to
send
them
a
message
that
here
in
america
if
you
study
hard
and
work
hard
if
you
obey
the
law
and
contribute
something
to
your
community
you
will
be
rewarded
by
your
country
you
can
build
a
future
from
you
own
dreams
that
has
always
been
the
promise
of
america
together
thats
what
this
summer
of
challenge
needs
to
be
a
reaffirmation
of
the
promise
of
america
for
so
many
young
people
to
whom
that
promise
has
been
an
illusion
we
can
make
it
a
reality
thank
you
very
much
applause

press

for
immediate
release
april
press
briefing
by
george
stephanopoulos
the
briefing
room
pm
edt
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
just
prepared
to
take
questions
today
q
george
bob
dole
says
that
the
clinton
administrations
policy
on
bosnia
is
a
failure
and
that
he
wants
the
united
states
to
take
the
lead
in
lifting
the
arms
embargo
so
that
the
bosnian
muslims
can
defend
themselves
mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
president
clinton
has
said
that
that
suggestion
is
under
active
consideration
obviously
this
is
a
tragic
situation
in
bosnia
and
if
the
bosnian
serbs
dont
come
to
the
negotiating
table
in
a
constructive
way
well
look
seriously
at
pressing
for
lifting
the
arms
embargo
in
the
meantime
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
a
tough
sanctions
resolution
in
the
un
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
but
the
prospect
of
an
arms
embargo
is
something
the
president
certainly
will
consider
if
the
serbs
dont
come
to
the
table
q
how
much
longer
are
you
going
to
give
them
to
come
to
the
table
george
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
that
right
now
q
its
been
a
long
time
q
on
february
the
president
mentioned
the
value
added
tax
in
ohio
and
when
he
was
asked
about
it
later
by
reporters
he
said
quote
that
is
a
radical
change
in
the
tax
system
of
the
united
states
its
something
i
think
we
may
have
to
look
at
in
the
years
ahead
questioned
again
about
it
later
he
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
it
wasnt
a
trial
balloon
or
anything
he
said
i
was
just
discussing
the
tax
response
to
a
question
donna
shalala
quoted
in
usa
today
this
morning
quote
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
whats
gone
on
q
the
same
with
alice
rivlin
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
the
health
care
task
force
is
reviewing
a
number
of
options
they
havent
made
any
decisions
yet
and
as
i
have
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
were
not
going
to
comment
on
decisions
that
havent
been
made
q
but
you
have
also
said
from
this
podium
time
and
time
again
q
wait
a
minute
whoa
nelly
whoa
q
that
that
was
not
under
consideration
q
yes
clinton
says
it
is
not
something
that
is
now
under
consideration
is
that
no
longer
true
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
the
working
group
as
ms
shalala
says
has
looked
at
this
prospect
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
of
any
kind
q
well
i
know
but
he
said
hed
tell
us
about
it
if
it
was
ever
under
consideration
i
take
it
that
now
he
is
and
he
didnt
tell
us
about
it
or
mr
stephanopoulos
did
he
say
if
it
was
under
consideration
or
if
it
was
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
ill
tell
you
mr
stephanopoulos
if
its
something
to
be
proposed
q
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
thats
a
direct
quote
mr
stephanopoulos
the
task
force
has
looked
at
a
number
of
different
options
they
have
not
made
any
decisions
yet
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
yet
this
is
one
of
the
proposals
under
consideration
by
the
task
force
was
to
go
out
and
cast
as
wide
a
net
as
possible
for
different
ideas
on
how
to
reform
the
health
care
system
they
have
cast
a
very
wide
net
they
have
looked
at
hundreds
of
different
proposals
probably
thousands
of
different
proposals
but
the
president
has
not
made
any
decisions
q
well
is
the
president
aware
of
their
consideration
of
this
option
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
hes
been
briefed
on
any
preliminary
conclusions
or
anything
like
that
from
the
task
force
on
this
specific
proposal
of
any
kind
i
dont
know
that
thats
gotten
to
his
level
he
started
yesterday
to
go
through
with
the
task
force
a
very
wide
range
of
decisions
and
i
dont
believe
that
thats
been
presented
to
him
no
q
well
hes
not
relying
on
the
usa
today
to
tell
him
what
his
task
force
is
considering
in
the
way
of
taxes
mr
stephanopoulos
no
hes
going
through
it
in
a
very
deliberate
fashion
there
are
a
number
of
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
i
dont
know
that
this
proposal
has
reached
that
decision
making
point
q
if
this
is
still
under
consideration
thats
a
change
at
least
from
what
weve
been
told
by
dee
dee
i
think
about
three
weeks
ago
or
so
she
said
that
is
not
an
option
talking
about
the
had
a
big
argument
with
somebody
over
this
so
i
remember
it
specifically
and
said
it
not
once
but
twice
is
that
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
if
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
something
that
is
being
looked
at
at
some
level
in
the
task
force
q
it
was
ruled
it
out
though
i
mean
unlike
other
options
that
youve
kept
in
the
mix
this
one
specifically
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
again
this
is
something
that
is
being
looked
at
but
no
decision
has
been
made
of
any
kind
i
mean
it
doesnt
its
not
necessarily
material
until
you
get
to
the
decisionmaking
phase
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
hundreds
of
different
options
q
if
it
was
ruled
out
before
and
its
not
ruled
out
now
then
something
has
changed
george
yes
no
q
when
a
guy
says
in
february
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
the
widest
possible
range
of
options
q
so
somethings
changed
they
werent
looking
at
it
before
theyre
looking
at
it
now
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
if
the
working
groups
have
gotten
to
that
point
yet
they
are
casting
a
very
wide
net
q
how
was
it
possible
that
you
and
dee
dee
were
able
to
sell
definitively
rule
it
out
as
an
option
previously
and
now
are
saying
that
in
fact
it
is
being
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
a
wide
range
of
options
they
have
not
q
do
you
deny
that
you
and
dee
dee
ruled
it
flatly
ruled
it
out
on
several
occasions
in
the
past
month
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
deny
that
i
mean
those
are
the
presidents
words
those
are
very
clear
q
subsequent
to
the
presidents
words
do
you
deny
that
within
the
last
month
you
and
dee
dee
have
both
publicly
ruled
it
out
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
the
timing
i
think
what
we
did
was
refer
back
to
the
presidents
words
and
say
they
stand
q
so
dont
they
stand
any
longer
q
march
clinton
said
for
the
next
four
to
five
years
it
was
ruled
out
mr
stephanopoulos
well
those
words
the
president
did
say
that
in
february
the
working
groups
are
on
a
separate
track
and
as
i
said
i
dont
believe
q
separate
from
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
this
has
been
presented
to
the
president
q
are
they
considering
something
that
the
president
q
has
ruled
out
q
has
ruled
out
i
mean
will
the
president
consider
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
again
the
working
groups
have
not
presented
this
to
the
president
they
have
looked
at
a
wide
range
of
options
i
suppose
that
if
an
argument
is
made
he
will
clearly
listen
to
it
that
does
not
mean
he
has
decided
to
do
it
q
can
we
put
this
another
way
in
his
answer
in
ohio
he
looked
at
the
vat
in
terms
of
restructuring
the
whole
tax
system
under
those
that
was
the
circumstance
that
he
said
it
might
be
considered
at
some
future
point
is
that
no
longer
the
case
or
is
that
the
only
way
that
he
can
see
a
vat
emerging
mr
stephanopoulos
i
guess
im
not
sure
exactly
what
youre
asking
q
he
talked
about
the
vat
in
the
context
of
a
restructured
tax
system
not
as
a
specific
way
to
finance
health
care
for
example
q
or
anything
else
q
or
anything
else
q
it
was
always
in
the
context
of
substituting
for
other
taxes
at
a
time
of
a
dramatic
overhaul
of
the
whole
tax
system
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
has
that
change
too
q
is
that
still
his
view
mr
stephanopoulos
i
havent
spoken
about
those
specific
comments
i
think
i
can
just
go
back
to
it
are
the
working
groups
have
they
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
yes
they
have
q
certainly
were
looking
at
a
vat
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
they
have
examined
the
possibility
of
a
vat
has
it
been
presented
to
the
president
has
he
made
a
decision
no
he
has
not
q
what
kind
of
a
deal
do
you
have
when
youve
got
the
presidents
appointed
task
force
obviously
not
oblivious
to
his
ruling
something
out
except
in
the
context
of
some
huge
down
the
line
reform
goes
ahead
on
its
own
and
considers
a
tax
which
he
has
specifically
ruled
out
in
any
context
other
than
much
later
and
then
goes
ahead
and
announces
that
thats
what
theyre
looking
at
is
the
president
concerned
about
that
sort
of
thing
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
the
presidents
concern
is
to
make
sure
he
gets
the
best
health
care
proposal
possible
hes
concerned
with
making
sure
that
they
have
the
most
thorough
process
for
examining
all
the
possible
alternatives
all
the
different
alternatives
if
a
decision
is
made
to
go
forward
with
something
like
that
its
certainly
something
the
president
will
explain
and
justify
but
no
decision
has
been
made
along
those
lines
q
what
does
it
mean
exactly
though
when
the
president
rules
something
out
does
it
mean
it
can
get
back
on
the
table
later
if
a
more
persuasive
argument
is
made
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
thats
indisputably
true
if
you
but
at
the
same
time
he
has
not
ruled
it
in
he
has
not
made
a
proposal
q
what
makes
him
open
to
it
now
when
he
wasnt
open
to
it
before
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
certainly
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
q
was
he
willing
to
listen
to
the
argument
for
a
shortterm
tax
this
year
and
he
wasnt
willing
to
listen
to
it
in
chilicothe
hes
now
open
to
it
mr
stephanopoulos
the
context
of
his
comments
was
that
it
was
not
something
he
wanted
to
be
clear
that
this
is
not
something
he
was
proposing
not
something
he
was
floating
q
not
something
he
was
considering
those
are
his
words
its
not
something
thats
now
under
consideration
if
we
start
considering
it
ill
tell
you
youre
now
acknowledging
are
you
not
that
it
is
under
consideration
and
mr
stephanopoulos
im
acknowledging
that
the
task
force
has
studied
this
proposal
i
am
also
stating
that
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
on
it
q
but
the
door
is
open
for
the
president
to
reconsider
including
this
as
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
obviously
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
again
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
do
you
know
if
they
will
make
a
presentation
on
behalf
of
the
vat
to
him
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
i
assume
that
if
i
dont
know
what
stage
they
are
it
in
proposing
i
dont
know
that
theyre
going
to
make
the
conclusion
that
this
is
something
they
should
present
to
him
i
know
this
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
q
do
you
understand
george
that
none
of
us
are
asking
these
questions
in
context
of
a
decision
that
the
president
has
made
only
about
what
the
president
is
considering
mr
stephanopoulos
i
understand
that
and
i
am
acknowledging
that
the
working
groups
have
examined
the
issue
of
a
vat
q
and
the
president
will
consider
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
assume
that
he
will
consider
the
argument
if
it
is
presented
to
him
q
does
that
mean
the
president
that
working
groups
think
that
when
the
president
says
no
he
means
maybe
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
means
that
the
working
groups
are
trying
to
do
the
most
thorough
job
possible
q
george
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
laughter
q
no
he
wants
us
to
stay
on
this
q
lets
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
q
no
he
got
out
of
that
swamp
q
i
think
weve
gotten
the
bottom
line
on
that
vat
reggie
bartholomew
your
special
ambassador
in
belgrade
today
said
that
if
the
serbs
do
not
accept
the
agreement
that
has
been
worked
out
quote
we
will
do
our
part
to
pursue
the
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
together
with
our
allies
that
seems
to
go
a
bit
further
than
what
youve
just
said
mr
stephanopoulos
sounds
almost
exactly
what
i
just
said
q
well
do
you
accept
in
other
words
you
accept
what
reggie
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
has
said
that
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
it
is
something
he
will
consider
if
the
current
actions
dont
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
q
isnt
there
some
kind
of
timetable
here
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
there
is
a
timetable
theres
going
to
be
a
vote
on
the
un
resolution
in
about
days
q
thats
on
sanctions
thats
on
tightening
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
right
thats
sanctions
and
we
believe
that
that
will
ratchet
up
the
pressure
and
we
hope
that
that
will
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
as
you
know
mr
bartholomew
also
met
with
mr
churkin
of
russia
and
they
are
also
working
on
ways
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
continue
to
pressure
them
in
many
different
ways
and
this
is
one
possible
option
as
well
q
the
question
is
whether
theres
a
timetable
for
consideration
or
a
vote
on
a
decision
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
not
the
sanctions
mr
stephanopoulos
the
next
vote
in
the
un
is
on
sanctions
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
no
votes
scheduled
on
lifting
the
arms
embargo
but
it
is
something
that
we
have
discussed
both
internally
and
with
our
allies
q
why
did
reggie
bartholomew
tell
the
serbs
that
the
us
would
do
that
what
was
the
point
of
his
telling
them
that
mr
stephanopoulos
well
clearly
i
mean
this
is
something
thats
under
consideration
and
this
is
something
that
we
take
quite
seriously
if
they
do
not
come
to
the
table
they
should
know
the
consequences
of
failing
to
come
to
the
table
q
have
they
been
given
a
deadline
q
warren
christopher
has
been
saying
the
same
thing
and
it
hasnt
seemed
to
change
the
serbs
behavior
in
the
least
why
should
the
serbs
take
any
heed
of
a
threat
to
lift
the
arms
embargo
when
so
far
everything
thats
been
done
has
had
no
effect
on
the
fighting
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
accept
the
premise
of
your
question
it
has
had
an
effect
the
embargo
is
having
an
effect
q
what
effect
mr
stephanopoulos
if
the
serbians
choose
not
to
heed
our
warnings
then
they
will
face
the
consequences
q
what
effect
has
it
had
in
bosnia
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
effect
that
it
has
had
on
the
serbians
it
has
tightened
up
they
are
not
getting
their
shipments
through
we
can
brief
more
fully
q
in
bosnia
george
in
bosnia
what
effect
has
it
had
mr
stephanopoulos
well
its
hard
to
say
if
its
stopped
the
aggression
to
date
that
is
why
were
continuing
to
press
for
the
serbians
to
stop
but
we
believe
that
over
time
we
will
continue
to
weaken
the
serbs
and
that
will
have
an
effect
im
not
saying
its
going
to
happen
overnight
it
clearly
hasnt
happened
overnight
but
we
believe
that
over
time
the
sanctions
can
weaken
the
serbs
if
it
fails
to
work
and
if
the
serbs
fail
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
well
move
forward
with
the
embargo
q
isnt
there
a
working
deadline
george
of
the
the
same
date
as
the
un
the
scheduled
un
vote
hasnt
the
united
states
said
along
with
many
of
the
other
nato
allies
that
if
the
serbs
arent
willing
to
sign
on
to
the
peace
accord
by
then
that
well
seek
havent
we
said
that
we
will
seek
mr
stephanopoulos
weve
said
continually
were
going
to
q
but
on
that
deadline
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
a
specific
date
but
were
going
to
move
forward
with
the
resolution
the
un
resolution
by
around
that
time
and
if
that
fails
to
take
effect
if
that
fails
to
bring
the
serbs
to
the
table
we
will
clearly
consider
other
actions
q
isnt
this
awfully
incremental
mr
stephanopoulos
were
taking
a
stepbystep
approach
were
ratcheting
up
the
pressure
and
were
going
to
continue
to
do
that
q
is
there
a
possibility
george
that
by
the
time
all
these
incremental
steps
are
taken
the
serbs
will
have
achieved
their
goals
and
then
whats
the
purpose
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
we
are
pursuing
that
goal
on
many
different
fronts
we
are
pursuing
it
through
the
un
were
pursuing
it
through
direct
talks
we
are
pursuing
it
through
tightening
the
sanctions
and
we
will
consider
lifting
the
arms
embargo
we
are
turning
the
screws
up
on
the
serbs
and
we
will
continue
to
do
that
q
but
if
the
efforts
have
been
unsuccessful
in
getting
the
serbs
to
stop
the
aggression
how
effective
will
any
campaign
be
to
have
the
serbs
give
back
what
theyve
gained
i
mean
once
theyre
entrenched
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
speculate
on
that
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
them
to
come
to
the
table
now
were
going
to
continue
to
find
ways
to
stop
the
aggression
but
i
cant
see
into
the
future
q
george
on
the
stimulus
package
house
republicans
say
theyre
going
to
hold
a
series
of
town
meetings
on
saturday
to
try
and
explain
the
details
of
your
package
they
cite
polls
which
show
that
the
more
people
learn
about
it
the
less
they
like
it
whats
your
strategy
to
counter
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
strategy
we
have
is
the
one
were
going
to
continue
as
you
saw
the
president
today
pointed
up
the
very
real
benefits
of
the
summer
jobs
program
that
this
package
will
provide
new
summer
jobs
this
summer
for
kids
in
inner
cities
and
suburbs
to
do
productive
work
we
are
also
going
to
point
out
the
benefits
of
the
highway
money
the
investments
in
highways
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
immunization
were
going
to
point
up
the
benefits
of
head
start
we
are
going
to
say
that
the
republicans
have
a
choice
they
can
take
action
to
create
jobs
or
they
can
perpetuate
the
gridlock
of
the
last
four
years
q
does
it
concern
you
though
that
the
house
now
the
house
republicans
are
after
you
as
well
as
the
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
the
house
republicans
voted
against
it
before
they
made
a
mistake
then
theyre
making
a
mistake
now
q
george
does
it
strike
anybody
in
the
administration
that
its
a
bit
strong
to
describe
as
the
president
did
this
morning
the
summer
jobs
program
as
quote
a
reaffirmation
of
a
promise
of
america
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
think
its
the
promise
of
america
to
give
kids
a
chance
to
reach
their
full
potential
q
governmentfunded
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
to
give
people
a
chance
to
work
absolutely
that
is
the
promise
of
america
q
i
want
to
follow
up
on
something
i
asked
yesterday
where
does
summer
jobs
where
does
that
figure
come
from
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
on
top
of
i
did
look
at
it
there
are
currently
summer
jobs
in
the
pipeline
this
will
be
on
top
of
the
so
it
will
be
a
total
of
million
q
the
would
be
created
by
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
where
does
that
number
come
from
because
weve
been
told
all
along
that
the
stimulus
package
would
create
new
jobs
and
according
to
panetta
that
breaks
down
to
something
like
fulltime
jobs
and
summer
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
but
the
summer
thats
when
you
do
their
fulltime
equivalence
i
mean
individuals
will
receive
jobs
this
summer
when
you
calculate
it
for
the
fulltime
job
effect
you
have
to
do
i
dont
know
what
the
exact
formula
is
q
seven
hundred
thousand
parttime
jobs
mr
stephanopoulos
or
q
one
to
four
because
its
three
months
mr
stephanopoulos
thank
you
q
can
i
follow
up
on
that
did
the
president
misspeak
this
morning
when
he
said
that
some
of
the
government
money
for
these
summer
jobs
will
pay
for
private
for
kids
to
work
in
the
private
sector
mr
stephanopoulos
not
necessarily
i
mean
i
think
that
there
will
be
grants
available
thats
one
of
the
ways
that
you
pay
for
the
jobs
at
the
same
time
hes
also
issued
a
challenge
to
the
private
sector
to
hire
kids
on
their
own
as
well
q
tax
dollars
for
instance
would
pay
for
kids
to
work
at
timewarner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
timewarner
is
actually
somebody
coming
forward
and
actually
doing
a
grant
thats
going
to
be
the
bulk
of
it
there
could
be
isolated
instances
though
where
there
would
be
grants
to
businesses
q
has
the
president
spoken
with
any
senate
republicans
this
week
mr
stephanopoulos
no
but
theres
been
a
lot
of
contact
with
senate
republicans
in
the
white
house
q
at
a
lower
level
but
the
president
hasnt
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
not
no
q
getting
any
closer
to
get
the
votes
mr
stephanopoulos
were
continuing
to
work
on
it
q
anybody
leaning
your
way
q
on
haiti
the
new
york
times
seems
to
be
reporting
something
of
a
breakthrough
in
aristides
attitude
towards
the
coup
leaders
can
you
confirm
that
there
has
been
this
change
and
what
impact
will
it
have
on
the
process
and
what
did
pezzullo
have
to
say
yesterday
in
his
report
mr
stephanopoulos
pezzullo
did
brief
the
principals
i
cant
confirm
whats
actually
happening
in
the
talks
i
would
leave
that
to
the
negotiators
themselves
but
mr
caputo
has
returned
to
haiti
we
have
received
a
briefing
here
at
the
white
house
from
ambassador
pezzullo
and
as
we
have
said
time
and
time
again
we
believe
that
assurances
of
security
are
important
to
a
final
resolution
to
a
broader
political
settlement
q
george
yesterday
you
offered
some
selective
breakdowns
of
how
the
stimulus
would
impact
some
states
and
cities
can
we
get
a
complete
breakdown
by
state
of
how
these
jobs
would
be
impacted
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
have
it
for
most
states
yes
and
i
think
we
can
get
it
out
q
could
you
make
that
generally
available
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
we
can
q
and
could
you
do
it
by
the
component
of
the
stimulus
in
other
words
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
we
can
do
i
know
that
we
can
do
it
by
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
i
dont
know
how
deeply
it
can
be
broken
down
but
clearly
we
can
break
it
down
into
summer
jobs
and
other
jobs
q
and
can
i
follow
up
is
this
the
information
that
jeff
eller
and
the
rest
of
the
white
house
is
using
in
the
ads
in
the
states
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyre
ads
but
theyre
press
releases
q
can
you
describe
what
those
press
releases
contain
mr
stephanopoulos
all
were
doing
is
pointing
out
the
benefits
of
this
package
to
various
states
for
instance
i
know
that
today
senator
dole
is
heading
up
to
vermont
and
new
hampshire
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
stimulus
package
the
jobs
package
creates
jobs
in
vermont
it
creates
jobs
in
new
hampshire
and
the
people
of
those
states
should
remind
him
that
this
is
important
q
where
are
the
releases
going
mr
stephanopoulos
they
go
to
the
states
q
to
whom
mr
stephanopoulos
we
can
get
them
its
no
problem
q
can
we
get
it
q
why
dont
you
put
them
out
here
as
well
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
we
can
q
this
afternoon
would
that
be
possible
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
check
i
dont
know
but
as
soon
as
we
can
q
are
you
focusing
these
press
releases
on
states
where
there
are
moderate
or
pragmatic
republican
senators
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
were
trying
to
get
as
many
as
we
can
its
actually
quite
difficult
to
pull
this
together
and
were
doing
our
best
were
putting
them
out
as
we
get
them
q
why
are
you
so
closely
tracking
senator
doles
schedule
mr
stephanopoulos
i
was
just
following
it
q
are
press
releases
going
along
to
states
where
hes
visiting
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
i
think
that
probably
there
are
press
releases
going
to
vermont
laughter
q
will
there
be
a
man
in
a
chicken
suit
waiting
laughter
q
george
as
the
president
goes
about
the
business
of
defending
whats
in
his
stimulus
package
he
doesnt
address
what
seems
to
be
the
republicans
main
point
that
youre
funding
it
with
deficit
spending
rather
than
if
its
so
important
why
not
come
up
with
the
funding
for
it
seems
to
be
the
republican
argument
and
how
do
you
answer
that
mr
stephanopoulos
what
was
answer
is
we
are
paying
for
it
over
time
and
if
you
look
at
our
budget
we
pay
for
this
package
over
time
we
believe
right
now
the
economy
needs
a
jump
start
for
jobs
q
youre
not
claiming
are
you
that
that
doesnt
add
to
the
deficit
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
im
saying
were
paying
for
it
over
time
i
didnt
say
that
q
i
know
that
george
but
i
mean
from
the
beginning
the
question
we
do
have
annual
budgets
and
things
deficit
spending
will
pay
for
that
this
year
will
it
not
mr
stephanopoulos
this
year
they
clearly
will
but
over
time
our
budget
fully
pays
for
this
program
q
what
youre
saying
is
that
there
are
savings
that
would
cover
this
if
it
were
this
year
in
future
years
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
thats
exactly
what
i
said
q
i
know
that
but
there
is
going
to
be
outstanding
debt
it
will
add
to
the
national
debt
from
this
year
mr
stephanopoulos
no
were
reducing
the
deficit
by
billion
billion
over
the
next
four
years
q
you
mean
youre
reducing
it
below
what
it
would
have
been
mr
stephanopoulos
exactly
q
in
fact
youre
adding
a
very
large
amount
to
the
national
debt
over
the
period
of
mr
stephanopoulos
but
were
reducing
it
far
more
from
what
it
would
have
been
thats
true
q
washingtontype
reduction
laughter
q
youre
getting
to
be
a
grumpy
old
man
q
george
has
any
decision
been
made
about
the
white
house
or
the
presidents
participation
in
the
gay
rights
march
coming
up
in
a
week
and
a
half
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
the
presidents
schedule
now
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
at
the
senate
democratic
retreat
in
jamestown
that
weekend
q
will
he
address
it
by
phone
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
that
its
a
little
far
out
but
i
believe
hes
going
to
be
in
the
senate
retreat
q
so
will
he
have
the
leaders
in
a
day
or
two
before
the
speech
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
i
would
expect
that
at
some
point
he
would
meet
with
the
leaders
of
some
of
these
groups
i
dont
know
the
schedule
on
it
though
q
will
there
be
an
aids
czar
appointed
prior
to
or
in
conjunction
with
the
event
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
april
is
earth
day
what
is
the
president
going
to
do
to
mark
that
and
is
it
the
case
that
he
is
going
to
sign
the
biodiversity
treaty
that
day
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
theres
been
some
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
i
dont
know
about
signing
it
that
day
but
i
would
expect
hell
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
or
right
around
then
q
where
is
the
work
on
the
biodiversity
treaty
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
check
with
katie
mcginty
i
just
know
that
theres
been
some
work
done
but
i
dont
know
exactly
what
q
when
is
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
the
i
think
q
why
is
it
you
know
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
statement
on
earth
day
but
you
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
said
i
dont
know
if
hes
going
to
meet
or
when
hes
going
to
meet
q
do
you
have
a
statement
on
the
gay
rights
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
actually
no
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
he
did
though
q
do
you
have
some
details
on
the
miyazawa
visit
mr
stephanopoulos
its
a
working
visit
on
friday
and
the
president
is
looking
forward
to
that
in
discussing
a
number
of
issues
including
russian
aid
and
the
japanese
stimulus
package
and
the
trade
issues
between
the
two
countries
q
there
was
some
expectations
that
a
second
aid
package
to
russia
was
going
to
be
unveiled
at
the
meeting
and
if
i
understand
it
hasnt
happened
why
is
that
or
whats
the
status
on
that
mr
stephanopoulos
the
meeting
is
still
going
on
and
as
you
know
secretaries
bentsen
and
christopher
have
talked
about
the
outlines
of
a
possible
package
but
were
going
to
continue
to
consult
with
congress
and
our
allies
on
that
q
we
will
not
then
make
any
kind
of
announcement
during
the
twoday
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
the
meetings
not
over
yet
q
is
that
when
youre
going
to
make
one
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
ruling
out
the
possibility
q
the
presidents
going
to
announce
it
tomorrow
q
bentsen
said
that
q
yes
bentsen
said
it
would
be
tomorrow
q
so
did
christopher
mr
stephanopoulos
id
have
to
look
at
that
but
i
believe
it
is
more
likely
that
the
announcement
will
come
out
of
tokyo
q
george
has
there
been
further
consideration
here
about
going
to
sending
the
president
out
to
los
angeles
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
theres
its
not
something
weve
ruled
out
we
dont
have
a
date
set
for
it
q
george
you
all
have
a
position
or
do
you
support
immigrations
plan
to
settle
iraqi
prisoners
in
the
united
states
mr
stephanopoulos
its
the
first
ive
heard
of
it
q
george
there
was
a
report
today
about
the
q
fortunately
laughter
q
about
the
pace
of
appointments
and
says
that
president
clinton
is
behind
president
bush
in
the
number
of
positions
that
people
have
been
nominated
for
are
you
going
to
speed
up
the
pace
of
nominations
or
where
do
you
stand
with
it
mr
stephanopoulos
we
filled
of
the
presidents
appointments
and
its
broken
down
we
have
schedule
c
noncareer
ses
pas
fulltime
im
not
sure
what
that
means
laughter
pa
fulltime
and
this
is
about
the
same
its
about
the
same
pace
of
president
bush
obviously
as
you
move
along
farther
once
you
each
level
of
appointment
actually
has
a
multiplier
effect
and
frees
up
far
more
appointments
so
we
expect
the
process
to
speed
up
but
were
at
the
pace
of
bush
obviously
wed
like
to
get
these
done
as
quickly
as
possible
i
would
point
out
that
the
fbi
background
checks
and
the
background
check
is
far
more
comprehensive
and
it
takes
more
time
than
our
predecessors
and
that
is
part
of
the
holdup
but
were
working
on
it
q
is
that
because
of
nannygate
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
an
awful
big
part
of
it
yes
q
in
the
story
this
morning
you
were
at
approximately
the
same
pace
as
bush
in
making
appointments
but
way
behind
in
winning
confirmations
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
where
the
background
checks
comes
into
play
thats
the
problem
q
thats
the
background
checks
problem
because
i
mean
you
have
a
democratic
senate
mr
stephanopoulos
no
thats
not
the
you
make
the
appointments
and
then
it
takes
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
fill
out
all
the
forms
and
have
the
background
checks
done
thats
exactly
where
the
problem
is
q
whats
the
president
doing
this
afternoon
and
whats
on
the
plan
for
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
some
meetings
just
office
meetings
this
afternoon
for
the
most
part
on
a
variety
of
issues
that
probably
a
halfdozen
different
issues
and
then
hell
be
tomorrow
well
have
an
event
probably
again
focused
on
the
stimulus
and
jobs
package
out
of
here
at
the
white
house
and
friday
is
the
miyazawa
meeting
q
will
you
be
releasing
his
tax
return
tomorrow
george
mr
stephanopoulos
either
tomorrow
or
friday
q
is
there
going
to
be
a
prebriefing
regarding
the
japanese
prime
ministers
visit
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
tomorrow
but
well
probably
get
something
done
as
we
usually
do
for
these
visits
q
was
reverend
jackson
here
this
morning
and
do
you
know
what
that
was
about
mr
stephanopoulos
he
was
here
he
met
with
a
group
of
us
here
at
the
white
house
including
mack
mclarty
q
who
q
reverend
jackson
mr
stephanopoulos

just

on
to
los

q
did

meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
actually
no
hes
in
continual
contact
with
the
president
he
had
written
a
letter
on
a
variety
of
issues
and
so
we
asked
him
to
come
in
and
talk
about
it
q
george
dole
is
having
a
fundraiser
for
jeffords
tonight
in
vermont
have
you
guys
been
in
contact
with
jeffords
at
all
on
this
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
been
some
contact
sure
q
can
you
tell
us
about
the
contacts
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
q
do
you
know
who
contacted
him
or
what
was
said
mr
stephanopoulos
i
know
that
howard
paster
talked
to
him
and
they
just
has
a
general
talk
about
the
package
q
and
did
he
express
his
support
for
it
now
or
is
he
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
divulge
the
details
of
the
conversation
but
there
have
been
conversations
q
the
la
times
is
reporting
that
abortion
elective
abortions
is
likely
to
be
included
in
the
basic
health
care
package
is
this
something
the
president
is
considering
mr
stephanopoulos
again
q
along
with
the
vat
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
its
certainly
something
thats
been
looked
at
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
what
was
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
the
la
times
story
on
whether
abortions
will
be
covered
by
the
presidents
health
plan
q
did
the
president
in
his
meeting
did
you
in
your
meeting
with
reverend
jackson
ask
his
advice
solicit
his
advice
about
what
kind
of
stance
the
white
house
should
take
in
the
wake
of
the
verdict
in
la
mr
stephanopoulos
well
we
certainly
talked
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
and
the
longterm
prospects
for
economic
development
and
other
issues
q
for
instance
did
you
discuss
whether
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
president
to
go
there
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
well
we
discussed
a
wide
range
of
issues
related
to
los
angeles
that
was
certainly
one
of
them
q
letting
you
perhaps
go
out
on
the
way
you
came
in
i
need
to
go
back
to
bosnia
just
for
a
second
and
ask
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
good
q
your
reaction
to
margaret
thatchers
comments
that
youre
just
sitting
by
and
watching
a
massacre
mr
stephanopoulos
well
weve
been
pushing
very
hard
on
a
number
of
fronts
for
more
aggressive
action
we
will
continue
to
do
that
q
can
you
tell
us
if
youve
made
any
progress
in
your
talks
on
the
stimulus
package
getting
a
compromise
i
mean
we
dont
have
any
feel
except
talks
are
ongoing
have
you
talked
to
like
people
or
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
the
numbers
weve
talked
to
several
people
and
weve
had
wideranging
sessions
q
anyone
leaning
your
way
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
get
into
that
were
just
going
to
keep

that
is

i
really
dont

in

to
do

about
the

of

if
you
really
want

we
can
get
into

just
how
idiotic
that
idea
is
read
i
do
not
know
what
the
fuck
im
talking
about
and
am
not
eager
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
my
point
was
that
it
is
pretty
stupid
to
justify
legalizing
something
just
because
it
will
be
safer
and
cheaper
from
a
pragmatic
standpoint
there
certainly
is
some
justification
if
it
is
a
vice
people
will
commit
anyway
shall
we
criminalize
alcohol
again
if
the
relegalization
for
alcohol
were
done
from
anything
other
than
the
pragmatic
standpoint
id
be
happy
to
hear
about
it
the
fact
is
that
it
wasnt
a
few
more
ideas
to
hold
to
these
criterion
prostitution
the
killing
of
all
funny
farm
patients
aids
victims
elderly
unemployed
prisioners
etc
this
would
surely
make
my
taxes
decrease
only
the
first
one
make
any
sense
there
is
nothing
to
legalize
about
all
the
rest
just
in
case
you
havent
made
the
connection
which
i
expect
you
havent
the
connecting
theme
in
this
thread
is
a
persons
autonomy
over
their
life
and
body
vice
statutes
serve
only
to
make
it
more
expensive
for
the
rich
and
more
dangerous
for
the
poor
as
tim
so
eloquently
put
it
people
will
however
take
autonomy
over
their
lives
regardless
of
what
the
government
says
and
why
pray
tell
is
aids
victim
in
snear
quotes
are
you
of
the
revisionist
sort
that
thinks
there
is
no

daevid

the
madison
edge
the
main
difference
between
adolf
hitler
and
rush
limbaugh
is
that
hitler
was
original
and
showed
initiative
mort
sahl
on
the
tom
snyder
radio
show
abc
radio
network
october
nlnsbelieve
it
or
not
i
was
planning
this
comparative
review
of
mein
kampf
and
limbaughs
transcribed
rant
the
way
things
ought
to
be
before
sahl
issued
his
comparative
review
as
usual
sahls
was
independent
and
sharp
as
a
scalpel
my
effort
can
only
dream
of
comparing
favorably
to
morts
at
least
it
has
a
fairly
popular
orginating
premise
everyone
id
mention
the
idea
to
thought
it
was
either
divinely
inspired
or
at
least
past
due
for
delivery
those
reactions
are
based
on
parallels
that
should
be
obvious
to
the
most
peripheral
observer
of
the
acts
of
those
false
prophets
both
are
noted
for
their
galvanizing
oratorical
skills
which
they
both
used
with
passion
to
generate
a
political
cult
of
massive
numerical
proportions
in
fact
limbaugh
claims
to
have
an
audience
of
just
over
million
almost
identical
to
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
hitler
in
the
april
german
election
both
used
a
myopic
social
perspective
to
build
the
cult
and
enthusiastically
amputated
facts
from
the
record
to
fabricate
their
ideological
quilt
the
last
point
is
glaringly
documented
by
passages
in
the
opening
pages
of
both
books
hitlers
example
is
when
on
page
he
claims
the
german
nationalist
terrorist
leo
schlageter
he
bombed
part
of
a
railway
line
between
dusseldorf
and
duisburg
being
caught
in
the
act
in
was
betrayed
to
france
by
a
representative
of
his
government
when
there
has
never
been
any
factual
foundation
for
such
a
statement
in
fact
the
governments
of
both
the
reich
and
prussia
as
well
as
the
vatican
actively
intervened
to
save
him
from
execution
and
almost
succeeded
limbaugh
follows
suit
by
making
the
hysterically
sarcastic
claim
in
his
introduction
that
in
a
school
or
during
a
commencement
ceremony
or
many
other
public
places
god
is
unconstitutional
of
course
its
not
god
but
the
official
imposition
of
particular
concepts
of
god
against
an
individuals
will
thats
unconstitutional
but
limbaugh
is
too
gleeful
in
his
talent
for
distortion
to
want
you
to
know
that
of
course
one
would
assume
that
by
comparing
the
two
books
my
main
point
would
be
that
the
way
things
ought
to
be
is
the
modern
american
mein
kampf
not
really
at
the
time
of
the
first
german
version
of
mein
kampf
hitler
was
just
four
months
out
of
prison
june
and
trying
to
reorganize
the
nazis
he
used
the
book
to
build
his
dozen
million
followers
limbaugh
on
the
other
hand
came
up
with
his
book
after
building
his
dozen
million
twelve
million
went
a
longer
way
in
weimar
germany
that
it
does
in
the
republicrat
united
states
thus
the
more
accurate
parallels
would
be
that
limbaughs
daily
threehour
radio
show
is
the
american
mein
kampf
the
primary
propoganda
tool
used
to
pump
up
the
angry
volume
and
that
the
way
things
ought
to
be
is
actually
the
american
triumph
of
the
will
a
translation
of
the
same
fascist
message
into
a
different
medium
also
the
printed
word
was
the
more
important
medium
in
weimar
germany
since
radio
was
still
being
thought
of
by
impoverished
germans
as
a
medium
of
luxury
in
today
on
the
other
hand
americans
are
more
likely
to
spend
a
few
seconds
to
tune
a
radio
dial
at
no
monetary
charge
than
drop
for
pages
of
transcripts
of
the
same
words
but
as
mort
sahl
also
observed
on
the
radio
the
other
night
some
cloutmeister
of
the
radical
right
wants
limbaugh
to
be
a
focal
point
of
their
propoganda
and
remember
sahl

comes

end
hoping
to
rebuild
it

if

it

dear

am
providing
this
report
consistent
with

of
the

resolution
to
advise
you
of
actions

i
have
ordered
in
support

beginning
with
un

council
resolution
of
september
the
united

has
been
actively
addressing
the
crisis
in
the
former
yugoslavia
the
security
council
acted
in
resolution
to
establish
a
ban
on
all
unauthorized
military
flights
over
bosniaherzegovina
there
have
however
been
blatant
violations
of
the
ban
and
villages
in
bosnia
have
been
bombed
in
response
to
these
violations
the
security
council
decided
in
resolution
of
march
to
extend
the
ban
to
all
unauthorized
flights
over
bosniaherzegovina
and
to
authorize
member
states
acting
nationally
or
through
regional
organi
zations
to
take
all
necessary
measures
to
ensure
compliance
natos

the

general
was
notified
of
natos
decision
to
proceed
with
operation
deny
flight
and
an
activation
order
was
delivered
to
participating
allies
the
united
states
actively
supported
these
decisions
at
my
direction
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
sent
an
execute
order
to
all
us
forces
participating
in
the
nato
force
for
the
conduct
of
phased
air
operations
to
prevent
flights
not
authorized
by
the
united

over
bosniaherzegovina
the
us
forces
initially
assigned
to
this
operation
consist
of
and
fighter
aircraft
and
supporting
tanker
aircraft
these
aircraft
commenced
enforcement
operations
at
am
edt
on

the
fighter
aircraft
are
equipped
for
combat
to
accomplish
their

the

cap
aircraft
will
normally
operate
from

in
italy
and
from
an

carrier
in
the
adriatic

unauthorized

entering

will
be
identified
interrogated
intercepted
escortedmonitored
and
turned
away
in
that
order
if
these

of
proper
authorization
by
nato
military
authorities
and
in
accordance
with
the
approved
more
over
rules
of
engagement
although
we
do
not
expect
such
action
will
be
necessary
the
commander
of
unprofor
the
united
nations
protection
force
currently
operating
in
bosniaherzegovina
was
consulted
to
ensure
that
his
concerns
for
his
force
were
fully
considered
before
the
rules
of
engagement
were
approved
it
is
not
possible
to
predict
at
this
time
how
long
such
operations
will
be
necessary
i
have
directed
us
armed
forces
to
participate
in
these
operations
pursuant
to
my
constitutional
authority
as
commander
in
chief
i
am
grateful
for
the
con
tinuing
support
that
the
congress
has
given
to
this
effort
and
i
look

to
continued
cooperation
as

all

that

the
point
is
that
this

no
one
but
the
established
car
dealers
or
people
with
enough
money
to
start
a
fairly
big
operation
all
at

protecting
these
folks
from
competition
protects
the
rest
of
us
from
low
prices
and
high
quality
an
excellent
point
but
you
seem
to
be
missing
a
more
subtle
point
it
is
not
the
government
that
should
be
the
recipient
of
your
displeasure
but
the
established
business
interests
that
influence
and
direct
government
action
in
this
case
it
is
the
government
that
is
preventing
entry
to
the
market
the
desire
of
those
running
established
businesses
to
prevent
or
restrict
the
entry
of
competitors
is
an
understandable
though
generally
unpleasant
human
failing
but
without
a
means
to
act
on
this
desire
without
a
government
with
sufficient
power
to
restrict
the
options
of
the
potential
competitor
the
anticompetitive
desire
remains
just
an
unpleasant
wish
the
government
is
the
linchpin
so
we
seek
to
disengage
it
so
we
dont
get
the
shaft
once
again
mark
you
dont
specify
the
means
through
which
the
government
is
to
be
prevented
from
becoming
the
tool
of
business
interests
as
a
leftwing
big
government
conventional
liberal
im
just
as
willing
as
you
are
to
vote
against
anticompetitive
regulations
that
favor
auto
dealers
but
what
i
hear
from
libertarians
is
a
desire
to
limit
incumbents
terms
to
weaken
government
by
eliminating
its
power
to
enforce
antitrust
laws
and
a
desire
to
eliminate
legislators
pay
each
strikes
me
as
a
particularly
ineffective
way
to
insure
that
auto
dealers
and
other
special
interests
cannot
influence
public
policy
in
fact
they
seem
clearly
designed
to
accomplish
the

steve

writes
as
noted
in
another
thread
limiting

the
problem
libertarians
face
is
insuring
that
the
limited
government
they
seek
does
not
become
the
tool
of
private
interests
to
pursue
their
own
agenda
believe
it
or
not
we
liberals
are
frequently
as
opposed
to
anticompetitive
measures
as
you
conservatives
we
dont
believe
however
that
competition
will
necessarily
be
protected
by
the
actions
of
business
interests
in
a
freemarket
after
all
in
the
example
you
cite
it
was
not
liberals
that
pressed
for
such
regulations
but
good
staunch
conservative
businessmen
as
adam
smith
so
eloquently
demonstrated
the
freemarket
is
not
something
that
capitalists
seek
to
protect
when
they
can
profit
from
its
elimination
the
same
point
was
made
by
marx
a
point
of
agreement
between
the
two
theorists
that
should
tell
us
something
i
do
not
want
the
government
to
become
a
tool
of
private
interests
limited
government
cannot
insure
that
private
interests
will
not
use
this
government
for
their
own
agenda
agreed
but
this
is
not
a
failure
of
libertarianism
it
is
the
fact
that
utopia
is
not
an
option
there
is
no
single
system
where
everything
is
perfect
it
is
a
failure
of
libertarianism
if
the
ideology
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams
just
as
marxism
fails
to
specify
how
pure
communism
is
to
be
achieved
and
the
state
is
to
wither
away
libertarians
frequently
fail
to
show
how
weakening
the
power
of
the
state
will
result
in
improvement
in
the
human
condition
so
it
is
wise
to
look
for
the
best
solution
if
you
compare
countries
to
see
which
ones
people
would
rather
live
in
which
ones
have
less
starvation
hunger
poverty
and
misery
you
will
find
that
they
have
a
more
limitted
government
than
countries
with
alot
of
poverty
misery
and
suffering
no
limitted
government
cannot
insure
anything
but
it
sure
is
better
than
the
alternative
big
government
this
is
a
strawman
argument
and
fails
on
several
grounds
in
this
case
limited
and
big
government
are
not
defined
i
would
point
out
that
lebanon
somalia
and
the
former
yugoslavia
are
by
some
definitions
nations
with
limited
government
while
the
us
canada
and
nations
in
western
europe
where
people
would
rather
live
are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with
big
government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds

an

as
you

what
i

from

is
a

eliminating
its

a

strikes
me
as
a
particularly
ineffective
way
to
insure
that
auto

no

the

funnily
the

one

weve
found
something
better
than
capitalism
there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
capitalist
system
and
if
something
be
it
socialism
or
anything
else
works
better
then
i
say
let
capitalism
die
then
why
are
they
in
the
process
of
systematically
dismantling
some
of
their
socialistic
health
care
systems

privitization
of

make
love
not
war
if
i
hold
a
gun
to
your
wife
would
you
respond
the
same
way
i
dont
think
so
while
the
age
of
aquarius
may
have
hit
the
white
house
the
age
of
peace
love
and
harmony
hasnt
hit
in
south
central
la
nor
has
it
hit
in
former
yugoslavia
and
as
long
as
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
would
rather
see
me
dead
than
thrive
i
want
the
protection
of
a
police
force
who
will
keep
the
peace
so
i
can
make
love
without
being
shot
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
is
possible
to
be
a
male
and
a
feminist
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
against
or
to
deny
equal
opportunity
to
a
majority
of
the
population
is
just
plain
wrong
and
trying
to
force
them
into
some
sort
of
tradition
role
is
even
worse
women
certainly
have
as
much
to
offer
this
world
as
men
and
the
day
that
gender
discrimination
is
finally
broken
it
going
to
make
all
the
revolutions
of
the
past
few
centuries
seem
like
reform
bills
i
look
forward
to
it
the
ultimate
statement
for
equal
rights
something
many
of
the
feminazis
have
forgotten
is
i
do
not
care
if
you
are
either
a
man
or
a
woman
i
do
not
care
if
you
are
black
or
white
i
do
not
care
if
you
are
gay
or
straight
once
you
can
honistly
say
i
do
not
care
about
color
race
or
gender
or
sexual
preference
then
we
will
truly
be
on
the
right
track
keep
shoving
differences
in
my
face
and
then
expect
us
all
to
get
along
get
real
so
long
as
you
try
to
make
me
care
if
you
are
black
female
or
whatever
i
am
going
to
continue
to
balk
its
natural
human
behaviour
but
the
moment
employers
searching
for
employees
banks
looking
to
lend
money
and
theclinton
administration
looking
for
appointees
can
honistly
say
i
do
not
care
about
your
color
race
gender
or
sexual
preferences
i
instend
instead
to
treat
you
as
a
human
being
crap
like
last
years
riots
will
continue
to
happen
hey
man
acadamia
rules
barf
you
mean
the
same
economic
theorists
who
say
things
like
for
the
sake
of
convenience
in
mathematical
modeling
we
will
first
assume
there
is
no
wealth
creation
now
get
a
crack
at
implementing
their
phd
thesis
in
real
life
go
back
to
your
textbooks
on
macroeconomic
theory
look
in
the
first
chapter
of
that
book
introducing
the
field
of
macroeconomic
theory
right
there
in
chapter
section
is
a
statement
like
the
following
as
it
is
difficult
to
predict
and
model
wealth
creation
especially
in
an
economy
where
wealth
creation
is
inherently
the
province
of
individuals
who
create
new
inventions
and
discover
new
ideas
we
will
assume
for
the
rest
of
this
book
that
there
is
no
wealth
creation
we
do
not
assume
the
lack
of
weath
creation
in
the
real
world
however
the
mathematical
modeling
of
such
an
inherently
unpredictable
subject
is
impossible
even
though
we
assume
no
wealth
creation
we
do
believe
that
for
most
mathematical
economic
modeling
such
an
assumption
is
reasonably
valid
as
it
allows
us
to
make
predictions
which
then
can
be
tested
so
the
guys
who
are
running
the
store
for
clinton
and
company
are
now
assuming
that
wealth
creation
does
not
exists
they
are
borrowing
an
idea
from
the
hitchhikers
guide
too
advanced
to
think
of
these
simple
things
to
be
honist
i

that

yes
that
is
most
certainly
true
however
the

reflects
a
valueless
position

infers
that
what
is
more
important
than
anything
else
is
to
have

self
this
of

is
foolish
should
a

a

a

pyromaniac
have
a
positive

of
themselves
of
course
not
a
person
that
engages

that
a
large

condemn

if
you

in

your

is

maybe
by

they
figure
all

will

giving

since

it
was

not

allow
friday
night
for

to

also
it
allows

as

as
give

when

a

will
remain
over

as
some

may
find
excuse
over

the

even
from

also
some

may
take
the

as

to

the

is
reached
by
david
irvings
hitlers
an
amateur
historian
whose
reputation
as
a
german
apologist
and
as
a
writer
without
regard
for
accuracy
or
truth
won
him
a
measure
of
notoriety
irving
produced
a
work
intended
to
show
that
hitler
was
kind
to
his
animals
and
to
his
secretaries
that
he
was
probably
the
weakest
leader
germany
has
known
in
this
century
and
that
he
did
not
murder
the
jews
or
even
wish
to
do
so
but
that
the
murder
was
committed
behind
his
back
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
was
indeed
the
case
does
this
mean
that
hilter
would
have
been
in
any
way
less
guilty
of
mass
murder
because
he
aquiesced
rather
than
participated
as
an
active
and
ardent
supporter
one
of
the
important
things
to
realise
about
the
nazis
is
that
the
system
was
far
more
evil
than
any
single
member
once
created
the
nazi
party
itself
was
a
murder
machine
that
would
inevitably
commit
genocide
there
was
noone
within
it
strong
enough
to
prevent
it
remember
that
hitler
did
not
originaly
lead
the
nazi
party
nor
was
he
particularly
powerful
within
it
until
his
oratory
allowed
the
party
to
come
to
power
had
hitler
reneged
upon
the
emotiaonal
expectations
which
he
had
created
within
the
ranks
of
his
supporters
he
would
have

as
he
had
himself
replaced
the
old
guard
who
he
beleived
were
unable
to
grasp
the
intellectual
implications
of
their
rhetoric
this
is
why
all
parties
that
espouse
nazi
style
race
supremacy
ideologies
must
be
considered
as
dangerous
and
as
evil
as
the
nazis
the
idea
that
one
race
of
people
is
inherently
superior
to
another
and
that
the
greatest
goal
of
humanity
is
to
achieve
racial
perfection
has
only
one
logical
outcome
the
gas
chambers
of
auschwitz
the
nazi
party
is
not
simply
the
tale
of
a
supremely
evil
single
man
who
lead
an
entire
country
astray
beyond
the
evil
of
individuals
there
was
the
evil
of
the
system
itself
which
was
self
generating
and
self
perpetuating
hitler
was
an
extreemly
evil
person
who
built
his
party
arround
an
ego
cult
centered
on
the
demonstration
of
his
own
power
this
does
not
however
mean
that
he
was
as
entirely
free
from
political
constraints
as
he
and
his
propagandists
worked
so
hard
to
assert
the
myth
that
racism
can
produce
a
strong
government
that
can
cure
a
nations
ills
must
be
emphatically
rejected
in
the
same
way
we
must
accept
a
distinction
between
a
govenrment
that
demonstrates
its
strength
and
one
that
is
able
to
govern
decisively
in
the
manner
it
beleives
is
best
i
would
accept
only
the
latter
as
a
strong
government
since
most
displays
of
strength
are
made
necessary
by
an
essential
weakness
it
is
important
to
understand
that
the
nazis
were
not
stupid
nor
were
they
amoral
in
the
sense
that
they
lacked
moral
scruples
they
acted
in
the
same
manner
as
the
spanish
inquisition
murder
and
torture
in
the
cause
of
morality
the
fault
of
the
nazis
lies
in
their
axioms
not
in
their
logic
nor
in
their
implementation
of
those
axioms
thus
all
such
parties
such
as
the
national
front
or
david
dukes
klu
klux
klan
front
who
assert
the
truth
of
those
axioms
must
be
considered
for
what
they
are
advocates
of
a
system
that
would
commit
genocide
the
conclusion
that
hitler
was
not
only
responsible
but
imensely
evil
is
inescapable
from
the
historical
record
it
is
important
though
to
not
let
the
conclusion
be
reached
that
the
nazis
espoused
a
set
of
ideas
that
were
basically
correct
but
had
an
unfortunate
proponent
the
evils
of
the
concept
of
race
supremacy
are
primary
although
this
most
emphaticaly
does
not
excuse
individual
culpability
this
is
nevertheless
secondary
no
matter
what
the
promises
made
by
a
racist
supremacist
party
upon
election
those
promises
will
be
broken
as
soon
as
circumstances
permit
if
this
requires
the
replacement
of
the
leaders
that
originally
made
the
pledges
that
will
occur
hatred
is
a
supreme
justifier
it
also
creates
a
dynamic
of
its
own
when
those
in
government
allow
it
reign
for
many
in
government
politics
is
a
method
of
providing
a
justification
for
their
own
existence
through
a
demonstration
of
their
importance
a
rhetoric
of
hatred
inevitably
develops
the
question
of
action
since
the
continued
existence
of
an
object
of
hatred
is
inevitably
a
reminder
of
the
essential
impotence
of
the
politician
thus
we
have
the
us
raid
on
tripoli
which
has
little
purpose
beyond
a
demonstration
of
power
it
is
important
to
realise
that
there
is
no
quantum
jump
between
the
politics
of
the
right
and
those
of
the
extreeme
right
but
a
progression
from
the
reinforcement
of
popular
predjudice
to
action
being
taken
on
the
basis
of
that
predjudice
in
the
same
way
the
extreeme
left
trace
their
route
to
despotism
through
their
assertion
of
the
subjugation
of
the
individual
to
ideology
it
is
important
though
that
in
attempting
to
understand
the
dynamics
of
political
systems
that
this
is
not
used
to
excuse
the
participants
the
leaders
of
a
nation
take
on
a
supreme
moral
burden
but
not
only
do
so
voluntarily
are
required
to
stive
to
do
so
thus
to
take
on
such
a
task
without
a
fundamental
examination
of
the
logical
progression
of
ones
set
of
axioms
to
its
conclusion
in
itself
is
a
moral
crime
furthermore
in
taking
on
such
a
duty
one
is
obliged
to
put
the
interest
of
the
whole
before
personal
concerns
even
of
personal
security
although
it
was
inevitable
that
a
party
such
as
the
nazis
based
upon
hatred
and
an
idolisation
of
the
symbols
of
power
should
have
saught
to
commit
genocide
it
was
not
inevitable
that
they
should
succeeded
each
member
of
the
system
had
an
ability
to
create
a
change
within
it
that
had
a
possibility
of
changing
the
dynamic
realising
that
the
individual
cannot
hope
to
control
a
system
does
not
mean
accepting
that
the

cannot
affect

i
think
canada
illustrates
that

does
have
an
effect
in
fact
its
suprising
that
there
is
any
difference
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
smuggle
a
gun
from
the
us
yes
its
amazing
isnt
it
in
fact
it
should
tell
you
that
gun
control
is
not
the
reason
your
crime
rate
is
low
since
any
idiot
can
smuggle
guns
into
canada
from
the

at
any
time
i
think
paul
was
trying
to
make
the
point
that
any
idiot
doesnt
there
are
surely
some
idiots
who
do
smuggle
guns
but
paul
seems
to
feel
that
the
exis
tence
of
stricter
gun
control
laws
has
had
a
deterrent
effect
this
seems
a
strange
argument
to
make
considering
that
canadas
violent
crime
rate
in
general
is
far
lower
than
that
of
the
us
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
greater
than
their
entire
crime
rate
it
would
seem
strange
to
suggest
that
it
to
were
the
result
of
gun
control
laws
i
think
if
we
looked
wed
find
very
specific
cultural
and
enforcement
reasons
why
the
nongun
rate
is
low
as
well
and
then
that
reasons
could
be
applied
to
the
withgun
rates
as
easily
given
that
most
criminally
used
guns
are
either
legally
purchased
or
stolen
from
those
who
purchase
them
legally
having
more
restrictions
on
legal
possession
does
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
reducing
gunrelated
crimes
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
find
the
idea
of
being
punished
because
somebody
might
steal
something
from
me
and
go
and
commit
a
crime
with
it
a
silly
solution
it
still
doesnt
address
the
question
of
canada
which
is
now
by
the
way
blaming
their
rising
guncrime
rate
on
the
us
strange
that
the
border
used
to
magically
keep
the
guns
out
but
now
isnt
it
certainly
makes
sense
that
it
would
well
it
makes
sense
to
some
of
us
anyway
the
other
side
of
the
coin
of
course
is
that
far
illegal
drugs
are
purchases
legally
or
stolen
from
people
who
purchase
them
legally
ive
still
not
been
convinced
that
guns
a
commodity
which
criminals
have
shown
their
perfectly
willing
to
pay
for
from
illegal
sources
stolen
either
from
police
military
or
civilian
we
wouldnt
simply
see
south
american
sources
from
which
drugs
come
start
smuggling
guns
as
well
since
theres
a
thriving
gun
manufacturing
industry
down
there
if
you
would
just
look
a
little
closer
at
the
crime
statistics
you
would
realize
that
our
nongun
crime
rate
is
also
very
high
so
guns
per
se
are
not
the
issue
directly
contradicted
by
the
nejm
study
that
compared
crime
in
seattle
and
vancouver
bc
the
nongun
rates
were
roughly
the
same
for
both
cities
the
difference
in
violent
crime
rates
was
almost
totally
gunrelated
and
as
was
not
pointed
out
in
the
study
but
in
critiques
of
it
two
seperate
articles
by
james
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
difference
was
also
almost
entirely
minority
related
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocketed
for
poor
minorities
blacks
and
hispanics
primarily
while
when
you
compared
the
white
majority
they
were
virutally
identical
the
problem
with
the
nejm
study
was
they
compared
minority
vs
nonminority
percentages
but
failed
to
take
into
account
the
relative
conditions
of
those
minorities
that
there
was
an
eqaul
percentage
of
nomnwhites
was
about
as
far
as
they
went
they
failed
to
take
into
account
that
the
nonwhites
in
either
city
were
not
living
in
the
same
conditions
if
the
situation
was
entirely
based
on
availability
of
guns
then
wed
expect
that
the
white
rates
the
two
groups
which
are
arguably
fairly
comparative
in
the
two
cities
would
have
a
far
higher
rate
in
seattle
yet
the
majority
in
seattle
is
not
only
not
significantly
higher
when
the
minorities
are
excluded
but
slightly
lower
violent
crime
is
highly
concentrated
in
the
inner
city
surprise
pick
the
area
with
the
highest
incidence
of
poverty
drug
use
disease
etc
since
rates
are
lower
in
suburbia
us
middle
class
folks
can
ignore
the
problem
the
point
is
of
course
that
many
of
the
us
innercity
problems
are
not
mirrored
in
canada
as
such
if
there
is
a
condition
which
is
significantly
different
in
canada
from
the
us
and
violent
crime
is
highly
correlated
to
that
area
suggesting
that
gun
control
is
the
source
of
canadas
low
rate
is
highly
questionable
as
one
canadian
pointed
out
on
talkpoliticsguns
canadas
major
gun
control
in
did
not
result
in
either
a
reduction
or
a
slowing
of
an
increase
in
violent
crime
rates
which
have
been
rising
steadily
since
apparently
they
didnt
even
mirror
the
uss
very
large
drop
of
violent
crime
in
the
early
eighties
most
violent
crime
occurs
in
areas
with
strict
gun
control
already
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
areas
implemented
gun
control
because
of
the
high
rates
true
only
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
was
instituted
while
it
had
crime
problems
true
but
that
crime
proceeded
to
explode
afterwards
similarly
for
new
york
the
question
is
not
simply
a
point
in
time
where
crime
was
high
or
low
did
the
gun
control
significantly
and
positively
impact
violent
crime
since
its
gone
up
in
those
areas
often
faster
than
it
was
going
up
before
you
cant
simply
dismiss
the
high
crime
rate
by
saying
gun
control
was
caused
by
it
yes
gun
control
may
be
instituted
to
deal
with
high
crime
but
if
the
crime
is
not
positively
impacted
you
cant
continually
say
that
that
crime
rate
was
entirely
a
cause
of
that
gun
control
since
much
of
that
crime
rate
increased
after
gun
control
was
implemented
just
as
happened
in
canada
similar
or
worse
rates
exist
in
cities
with
poor
gun
control
as
would
be
expected
if
violent
crime
was
generally
independent
of
gun
control
and
the
jury
is
still
out
on
the
question
of
whether
recent
tough
laws
in
washington
dc
may
have
alleviated
violence
and
suicide
rates
there
would
this
be
the
laws
which
made
manufacturers
liable
for
what
others
did
with
their
guns
and
suddenly
the
police
found
nobody
would
sell
to
them

well
yes
and
no
the
federalist
papers
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
determine
precisely
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
there
are
a
couple
of
ways
to
look
at
them
one
is
we
want
you
to
support
this
constitution
so
well
say
anything
that
we
think
will
appeal
to
you
or
the
more
straightforward
this
is
why
we
think
what
weve
suggested
in
this
constitution
is
a
good
idea
you
clearly
consider
the
former
to
be
the
primary
situation
the
point
is
that
they
did
not
make
pains
to
point
out
where
the
consitution
may
have
been
aginst
the
new
yorkers
interests
also
they
did
not
want
to
raise
opposition
by
basing
their
advocacy
on
unpopular
principles
horrors
appealing
to
popular
principles
can
we
perhaps
as
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
might
have
been
written
to
appeal
to
the
principles
rather
than
as
you
appear
to
believe
it
was
written
with
something
else
in
mind
and
propoganda
put
out
by
its
supporters
but
lets
be
honest
about
something
here
when
was
the
last
time
you
brought
up
all
the
valid
points
against
your
own
arguments
or
are
they
simply
propogranda
we
cant
know
what
phill
really
means
because
hes
obviously
using
arguments
designed
to
convince
well
i
know
hamilton
was
a
dyed
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probably
the
authoritarian
extreme
to
jeffersons
democratic
impules
but
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
means
of
determining
their
opinions
on
the
government
if
we
dont
consider
what
they
wrote
about
the
government
i
dont
propose
that
any
means
exists
for
determining
their
true
opinions
thus
their
true
opinions
died
with
them
and
are
of
little
help
today
their
opinions
have
not
the
slightest
bearing
on
the
matter
though
only
their
arguments
these
are
true
or
false
regardless
of
who
said
them
or
why
if
theyre
true
or
false
regardles
of
why
they
were
said
why
on
earth
did
you
make
a
point
of
calling
them
propogranda
that
would
seem
to
be
irrelevent
the
difficulty
that
most
us
posters
seem
to
have
is
in
considering
that
their
arguments
may
have
been
flawed
or
no
longer
apply
to
modern
societies
oh
i
have
no
argument
with
questioning
them
i
dont
believe
they
no
longer
apply
but
thats
because
i
think
most
of
them
were
good
arguments
im
not
entirely
happy
about
the
situation
because
they
were
obviously
only
applied
to
a
minority
of
the
time
but
i
dont
think
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
them
if
they
were
alive
today
the
one
opinion
we
could
count
upon
these
men
to
express
is
that
a
careful
study
of
the
mechanisms
of
government
is
necessary
and
that
an
ongoing
improvement
of
the
same
is
required
they
gave
their
opinions
in
certain
areas
and
have
been
proved
right
in
other
areas
they
got
it
wrong
they
ensured
that
there
was
a
mechanism
to
adapt
and
improve
the
consititution
this
can
only
happen
if
there
is
a
willingness
to
accept
that
the
structural
problems
within
the
us
political
system
may
require
constitutional
change
as
a
solution
since
the
us
constitution
is
the
basis
for
the
us
political
system
most
changes
in
it
would
require
constitutional
change
in
this
particular
case
however
the
fillibuster
is
a
matter
of
procedure
and
tradition
it
only
should
have
been
made
part
of
the
constitution
if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principle
no
in
practice
yes
in
principle
no
that
they
had
less
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
less
power
the
british
government
today
is
theoreticaly
dependent
on
the
will
of
the
monarch
by
convention
any
monarch
seeking
to
exercise
that
power
is
deposed
the
subtly
is
that
the
prime
minister
is
not
able
to
identify
their
politics
with
the
national
interest
in
the
same
manner
that
us
presidents
regularly
do
phill
were
discusing
the
power
of
legislative
houses
while
the
prime
minister
is
member
of
parliament
he
is
more
analgous
although
badly
to
the
us
president
now
please
explain
to
me
how
the
us
house
of
representatives
is
in
principle
more
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
or
the
senate
but
in
practice
is
less
are
you
suggesting
that
the
writers
of
the
constitution
really
intended
for
them
to
be
more
powerful
but
gosh
darn
the
thing
was
ratified
before
they
realized
theyd
forgotten
to
put
those
extra
restrictions
on
the
senate
in
i
disagree
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
was
simply
designed
to
handle
less
than
it
has
demanded
that
it
handle
as
somebody
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
has
become
everybodys
city
council
one
reason
for
that
is
that
at
every
level
the
government
is
rendered
unable
to
come
to
decisions
these
decisions
are
pushed
up
to
the
next
higher
level
instead
not
at
all
as
any
entry
level
political
science
course
will
tell
you
people
who
want
laws
implemented
will
always
choose
the
level
of
government
to
attack
which
presents
them
with
the
best
chance
of
getting
what
they
want
with
national
interest
groups
it
is
simply
a
very
rational
thing
to
do
to
want
the
federal
government
to
enact
a
law
rather
than
the
states
less
people
to
persuade
and
less
contributions
to
make
why
do
those
concerned
about
abortion
primarily
concentrate
at
the
federal
level
simply
because
if
they
win
that
battle
all
the
little
state
battlefields
are
won
by
extension
the
same
extends
to
insurance
medicine
and
most
other
questions
local
government
has
not
failed
in
that
it
hasnt
done
what
it
should
but
that
it
is
dominated
by
local
interests
thus
nonlocal
interests
who
want
localities
to
abide
by
their
rules
cant
get
their
rules
past
the
local
government
thus
since
theyve
got
more
clout
only
in
the
wrong
place
they
appeal
to
the
next
higher
level
because
it
can
impose
its
will
on
the
lower
i
mean
lets
get
real
here
do
we
really
need
the
congres
of
the
united
states
deciding
that
x
traffice
light
should
be
on
thus
and
such
pattern
or
that
carjacking
needs
to
be
a
federal
as
opposed
to
a
local
crime
the
more
people
want
the
more
congress
will
take
power
to
sell
it
to
them
for
their
votes
i
dont
think
the
rise
of
special
interests
is
coincidence
with
the
increased
power
of
congress
congress
is
more
than
capable
of
quick
action
and
has
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
its
hands
if
it
confined
itself
to
what
its
original
jurisidiction
was
and
allowed
more
local
autonomy
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfare
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidy
motto
they
would
be
better
placed
as
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
state
money
being
handed
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
governmental
ladder
the
less
actual
need
matters
because
political
power
can
be
concentrated
at
higher
levels
while
people
with
less
cloud
only
find
themselves
reduced
to
in
effectiveness
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
states
with
pork
defense
contracts
agricultural
subsidies
etc
or
to
be
precise
of
the
states
since
you
need
to
beat
the
filibuster
then
why
not
simply
leave
new
yorks
education
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinved
that
there
is
any
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capable
of
educating
its
own
children
if
thats
what
they
want
to
do
and
if
you
leave
it
to
them
you
only
have
to
worry
about
the
pork
in
that
state
and
since
industries
cant
concentrate
their
political
power
and
wealth
rather
they
must
divide
it
among
the
states
to
try
and
get
what
they
want
individual
voices
have
more
relative
impact
the
problem
with
the
fillibuster
is
not
that
you
must
buy
off
states
but
that
the
congress
has
acquired
too
much
power
to
sell
pork
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
government
they
created
failing
but
that
it
is
operating
under
a
set
of
conditions
they
specifically
wanted
to
avoid
namely
a
concentration
of
power
it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduce
the
power
of
either
house
in
some
attempt
to
grease
the
wheels
all
youll
get
then
is
a
system
which
moves
quicker
to
do
stupid
things
it
would
make
more
sense
to
make
more
decisions
at
a
local
level
no
you
have
to
break
the
machine
free
of
seizure
before
you
can
redirect
it
but
why
on
earth
should
we
want
to
redirect
it
you
said
yourself
that
you
have
to
sell
pork
to
get
things
through
congress
if
congres
has
less
authority
to
sell
pork
and
retains
its
authority
to
enact
national
legislation
within
its
granted
jurisdiction
the
pork
problem
is
significantly
reduced
the
current
blocks
on
power
simply
absolve
congress
of
any
responsibility
to
come
to
a
decision
the
current
blocks
essentially
state
that
inaction
is
preferable
to
action
thus
it
the
system
is
weighted
against
action
considering
the
government
the
usually
the
institution
with
the
sole
power
to
enforce
its
decisions
by
force
i
consider
bias
against
making
those
decisions
a
good
thing
pushing
the
decisions
lower
in
the
pyramid
wont
work
unless
the
lower
levels
are
less
corrupt
in
most
cases
they
are
worse
not
better
the
difference
with
the
lower
pyramid
is
that
a
they
have
more
legal
legitimate
authority
in
most
matters
under
our
constitution
than
the
federal
government
and
b
at
those
lower
levels
power
is
harder
to
concentrate
and
c
you
get
the
benefit
of
not
imposing
new
deicisons
on
everybody
at
once
you
get
to
see
them
tried
out
without
a
national
decision
congressional
action
usually
treats
the
entire
country
as
a
whole
yet
even
with
similar
problems
in
different
areas
different
solutions
may
be
called
for
and
while
i
often
dont
agree
with
the
decisions
my
local
and
state
reps
make
at
least
i
have
a
better
option
of
going
to
the
city
council
and
shooting
my
mouth
off
id
much
rather
the
majority
of
laws
be
made
by
accessible
people
who
hang
around
and
end
up
having
to
put
up
with
them
rather
than
somebody
far
off
in
washington
with
half
a
million
or
more
constituents
im
curious
what
you
base
your
assumption
that
lower
levels
are
more
corrupt
i
fail
to
see
where
any
restrictions
implied
or
otherwise
were
placed
on
the
veto
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
read
as
a
means
to
put
a
check
on
democratically
popular
but
unwise
in
the
executives
opinion
policies
since
we
were
arguing
from
the
federalist
papers
i
would
point
to
them
phill
you
brought
up
the
federalist
papers
we
were
arguing
the
fillibuster
and
whether
or
not
a
minority
of
senators
should
be
allowed
to
hold
up
a
bill
you
claimed
the
senate
was
suppose
to
be
a
far
less
powerful
house
and
i
contended
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
other
writings
which
indicated
this
which
was
when
you
brought
up
that
we
cant
decide
what
the
founders
wanted
based
on
the
federalist
papers
you
argued
against
them
i
never
argued
from
them
i
have
primarily
referred
to
the
constitution
which
places
only
very
small
restrictions
on
the
senate
than
for
the
house
the
us
constitution
gives
almost
no
reasoning
as
to
how
it
should
work
the
only
part
where
a
reason
is
given
is
the
right
to
bear
arms
ammendment
where
the
well
regulated
militia
justification
is
ambiguous
the
us
constitution
is
a
nutsandbolts
document
the
delcaration
of
independence
was
the
highbrow
reasoning
there
are
a
couple
of
other
examples
though
such
as
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
tax
and
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
grant
permits
both
in
article
i
section
that
the
veto
was
meant
to
be
an
exceptional
measure
follows
from
the
fact
of
the
senate
if
the
president
was
meant
to
revise
legislation
then
there
would
be
three
chambers
of
the
legislature
not
two
furthermore
the
separation
of
powers
would
have
been
much
less
distinct
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believe
the
veto
has
become
something
it
wasnt
intended
however
i
also
believe
it
is
inevitable
considering
the
congress
own
abuse
of
their
power
to
make
bills
say
whatever
they
want
them
to
say
unlike
most
people
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worrying
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessitates
its
abuse
there
is
no
limit
in
the
constitution
to
the
presidents
veto
power
regarding
what
a
bill
is
for
previous
presidents
have
used
the
veto
for
any
number
of
reasons
most
usually
having
something
to
do
with
their
agenda
i
am
really
curious
how
you
single
bush
out
as
the
president
who
abused
vetos
he
has
the
record
for
vetos
bush
phill
thats
absurd
bush
had
vetos
one
of
which
was
overridden
go
read
up
on
fdr
if
you
think
thats
anything
resembling
a
record
why
is
it
not
a
reasonable
restriction
because
senators
is
the
magic
holy
number
upon
which
laws
must
be
based
if
senators
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constituencies
to
stand
up
and
fillibuster
isnt
that
enough
to
indicate
theres
a
sufficient
question
as
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevaluate
it
up
to
a
point
the
fact
is
though
that
when
the
majority
are
opposed
by
a
minority
the
minority
should
not
be
allowed
to
win
by
default
why
not
what
is
inherently
wrong
with
biasing
the
system
against
action
historically
governemnt
action
in
the
us
when
dealing
with
issues
with
a
bare
minority
and
a
large
minority
have
not
been
successful
when
youre
in
a
position
of
imposing
federal
power
on
diverse
people
why
should
the
federal
government
not
have
to
got
through
something
more
than
a
bare
majority
why
one
earth
should
be
sufficient
to
enact
a
law
which
covers
million
people
in
very
very
diverse
places
and
living
in
radically
different
conditions
why
shouldnt
a
supermajority
be
required
because
the
bill
at
issue
is
a
money
bill
relating
to
a
short
term
proposal
now
were
switching
from
a
general
question
of
a
fillibuster
to
a
specific
bill
i
dont
see
how
it
make
a
difference
it
is
not
a
change
in
the
law
where
a
presupposition
in
favour
of
the
status
quo
is
arguable
sure
its
arguable
theyre
arguing
it
however
requiring
to
bring
it
to
a
vote
ensures
that
theyll
have
to
have
a
good
argument
something
that
isnt
based
solely
on
party
lines
any
system
in
which
the
simple
majority
is
given
absolute
power
to
ignore
the
minority
then
the
minority
will
be
ignored
i
do
not
see
this
as
a
positive
thing
and
for
all
that
im
sure
the
republicans
are
looking
for
pork
as
much
as
the
democrats
theyve
got
some
legitimate
objections
to
the
legislation
in
question
so
instead
you
consider
a
system
under

is
hardly
a

you
can
start
by
teaching
your

that
the
perpetrators
of
crimes
no
more
represent
the
black
community
than
racist
hateful
whites
represent
the
majority
culture
although
there
are
many
ethnic

who
have
fallen
into
the
very
trap
that
you
are
struggling
with
and
believe
otherwise
the
trap
is
the
easy
way
out
for
yourself
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
realize
that
the
demographics
related
to
the
crimes
you
speak
of
have
less
to
do
with
race
and
much
to
do
with
socioeconomic
status
and
disenfranchisement
youre
going
to
find
higher
crime
within
any
community
comprised
of
any
ethnic
group
or
subgroup
that
has
become
dysfunctional
whatever
the
factors
leading
to
that
dysfunction
with
ethnic
minorities
it
is
more
usually
than
not
as
i
said
socioeconomic
disenfranchisement
if
for
example
you
lived
in
an
area
where
there
were
very
few
blacks
but
quite
a
few
poorforgenerations
whites
youd
see
the
crime
statistics
reflecting
the
dysfunction
of
those
white
people
would
you
then
worry
about
whther
your
children
would
begin
to
see
whites
as
undesireable
or
whatever
the
trap
springs
into
action
when
our
innate
compunction
to
define
us
and
other
raises
its
little
voice
the
trap
becomes
dangerous
when
we
stop
to
listen
to
that
little
voice
and
stop
thinking
like
rational
humans
its
interesting
that
blacks
are
traditionally
seen
as
the
or
the
most
criminal
element
in
many
of
our
urban
areas
i

i
cant

ethnic
diversity
here
we
have
black
gangs
hispanic
gangs
asian
yes
the

minority
gangs
and
even
a
few
white
gangs
the
asian
gangs
have
become
a
particularly
troublesome
element
for
law
enforcement
here
mainly
due
i
think
to
their
propensity
for
engaging
in
organized
criminal
activities
but
ask
people
on
the
street
and
theyll
times
tell
you
that
black
gangs
and
crime
are
what
they
most
fear
during
the
disturbance
in
los
angeles
last
year
many
of
the
rioters
and
looters
were
not
black
some
were

i
remember
being
amazed

television
news
scenes
that
showed
looting
mobs
where
there
were
maybe
one
or
two
blacks
at
most
my
perceptions
gleaned
from

news
were
further
corroborated
by
numerous
friends
and
relatives
that
live
in
los
angeles
this
may
have
been
the
countrys
first
truly
multiethnic
riot
yet
i
know
from
facetoface
and
online
discussion
that
in
the
minds
of
america
the
popular
perception
is
that
it
was
a
black
riot
in
closing
id
like
to
say
that
you
raise
some
interesting
points
that
really
need
discussion
our
country
has
spent
too
long
ignoring
the
racism
and
its
attendant
ills
that
is
very
much
a
part
of
our
culture
as
a

we
are
afraid
to
face
up

some
hurtful

and
the

we

the

every

your

that

we

we

if
marijuana
were

undoubtedly
more
people
would

that

people

get

tell

why
any

be

viz
alcohol
or
are
you
for

on
that
too
now
ill
tell
you
more
people
are
killed
by
alcoholrelated
accidents
than
all
other
drugs
combined
by
far
probably
because
more
people
have
access
to
alchohol
it
is
legal
you
know
the
problem
with
the
wod
is
that
it
has
no
bite
sending
the
slimy
bastards
to
the
chair
for
selling
drugs
to
kids
now
theres
some
bit
yeah
thats
it
send
a
kid
from
the
innercity
who
has
no
other
viable
means
to
make
money
and
turns
to
selling
drugs
to
an
overcrowded
federal
prison
where
he
learns
to
do
real
crime
of
course
this
kid
would
be
much
better
off
selling
crack
to
his
neighborhood
and
helping
in
its
demise
without
drug
money
being
pumped
into
these
blights
from
the
affluent
outside
there
would
be
no
crime
who
would
they
steal
from
each
other
drugs
bring
money
into
the
community
just
like
any
other
business
would
except
that
since
drugs
are
illegal
the
economy
is
an
underground
one
and
if
those
drugs
were
legal
the
neighborhood
could
legally
go
to
hell
a
selfsustaining
underground
economy
can
only
proliferate
by
a
constant
willful
infusion
of
money
from
the
outside
if
you
take
away
drug
laws
you
put
an
end
to
the
underground
economy
and
therefore
to
largescale
crime
and
if
we
made
murder
legal
we
would
put
an
end
to
murder
as
a
crime
kids
in
the
innercities
are
faced
with
a
very
tough
life
growing
up
there
or
selling
drugs
and
having
everything
at
their
fingertips
instantly
many
kids
choose
selling
drugs
they
sell
products
to
people
who
want
to
buy
them
they
make
money
off
of
rich
white
kids
from
the
suburbs
then
they
go
to
prison
then
they
become
hardened
criminals
and
learn
that
youre
much
better
off
stealing
carstereos
in
the
suburbs
because
all
the
police
forces
are
spending
all
their

in
the

saving
people
from

you
can

all
the

you

and

the

never
has

crack
is

you

babies
who
are

are

no

the

the

including
a
sample
chart
of
copayment
percentages
for

youre
covered
for
of
the
public
hospital
rate
afterward
with
extra
private
insurance
you
can
get
into
a
private
hospital
and
be
covered
for
any
differences
beyond
the
public
hospital
rate
the
public
insurance
covers
beyond
days
or
the
same
cash
amount
for
a
private
hospital
and
the
difference
is
paid
outofpocket
or
according
to
your
supplementary
private
insurance
over
of
french
have
some
form
of
extra
private
insurance
so
of
health
costs
in
europe
are
out
of
private
funds
and
not
gleaned
from
other
taxes
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
using
the
same
methods
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
that
the
french
had
deductibles
and
copayments
in
their
insurance
fund
is
to
their
credit
i
am
in
the
minority
for
advocating
such
back
in
canada
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
im
one
of
the
few
people
who
favour
copayments
forget
about
leftists
even
our
conservatives
attack
me
for
it
on
the
canadian
newsgroups
to
make
it
look
more
like
real
insurance
cos
the
insurance
payment
is
hidden
unlike
in
france
and
if
you
didnt
know
it
youd
believe
it
actually
is
socialized
medicine
american
conservativeslibertarians
and
canadian
leftists
are
the
only
ones
who
seriously
call
it
that
canadians
arent
worried
about
the
americans
who
spend
were
worried
about
the
french
and
germans
who
spend
to
our
so
the
insurance
is
looking
at
things
that
shouldnt
be
paid
for
out
of
general
funds
like
physicals
for
insurance
policies
sick
notes
electrolysis
etc
the
reason
that
the
canadian
health
insurance
hasnt
spiralled
out
of
control
despite
being
open
and
universal
is
that
unlike
americans
there
is
no
urge
to
spend
all
of
your
benefits
worth
and
more
if
you
can
were
a
different
culture
like
the
play
or
pay
model
managed
competition
leaves
in
place
two
elements
of
the
current
health
care
system
that
reformers
most
often
criticize
the
private
forprofit
insurance
industry
and
the
employerbased
system
of
coverage
managed
competition
compels
employers
to
enroll
their
workers
in
large
pools
of
health
insurance
customers
entire
industries
may
for
example
sponsor
a
pool
or
network
insurance
companies
doctors
hospitals
and
other
health
care
providers
then
bid
for
the
pools
business
competing
in
theory
on
the
basis
of
price
and
quality
managed
care
relies
on
hmos
which
are
unknown
in
most
western
nations
that
use
only
public
health
insurance
like
canada
france
and
germany
im
canadian
and
my
german
fatherinlawtobe
says
of
hmonhs
approaches
we
left
that
behind
with
east
germany
sure
hmonhs
controls
costs
because
you
have
managers
strangling
doctors
with
budget
strings
in
canada
we
use
the
public
health
insurance
approach
as
in
france
and
germany
with
all
private
doctors
and
both
private
and
public
hospitals
it
is
all
pure
insurance
without
hmos
the
divisions
are
different
with
the
germans
using
a
couple
hundred
interlinked
sickness
funds
over
a
century
old
while
canada
divides
by
their
provinces
who
run
the
insurance
fund
and
set
local
fees
with
the
doctors
monopoly
federal
funds
cover
the
fees
disbursed
with
such
an
openended
system
its
no
surprise
that
canada
is
to
the
us
in
costs
allinsurance
is
the
most
expensive
way
to
go
the
french
and
germans
use
the
same
approach
but
have
larger
populations
in
more

thats
because
among
other
things
theyve
given
their

power
to
bargain
with

over

the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the

lack

defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of

is
really
why
we

less
using
the
most

of
pure

in

along
with

without

the
nyt
has
admitted
that

insurance
fees
are
an
order
of
magnitude
lower
in

but
doctors
takehome
pay
is
almost
equal
to

also
minimal

the

is
sooo

early
march
part

for
using
the

approach
like
the
french

germans
do
hey
why
dont
they
criticize
france
and
germany
is
it
because
too
many
people
take
french
and
german
in
college
to
make
the
accusations
stick
was
to
preserve
the
doctors
independance
since
the
provincial
wings
of

are
the
ones
that
go
to
bat
when
the

schedule

are
presented
the
politicallybent
doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the

would

rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike

socialized

approaches
like
britains
national

youve
got
to
remember
youve

a

as

its
not
as

if
youre

you

you
dont
go

you
ration

market

i
have
md
friends
who

there

not

wouldnt

mean
that

in

provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private

a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
of
course
the
one
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
canadafrancegermany
case
private

offloaded
the

things
like
privatesemiprivate
rooms
vs
ward
accomodation
dental
glasses
etc
for
corporate
or
personal
benefits
theyll
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
if
you
want
to
be
covered
for
basic
care
at
that
point
they
wouldnt
even
consider
a
voucher
approach
to
broker
the
universal
coverage
and
sell
policies
to
make
up
the
difference
in
the
federal
guidelines
and
market
stuff
wouldnt
free
care
encourage
people
to
run
to
the
doctor
for
every
ache
and
pain
people
who
get
free
treatment
do
go
to
the
doctor
and
hospital
about
a
third
more
often
than
those
who
have
to
pay
a
share
of
their
medical
bills
still
canadians
who
pay
nothing
at
the
doctors
have
a
lower
perperson
health
bill
than
we
do
it
is
free
in
that
there
are
no
deductibles
nor
copayments
two
things
which
i
advocate
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
on
my
pay
stub
manitoba
did
not
collect
at
paycheque
time
but
only
annually
at
income
tax
time
built
into
the
tax
rate
only
fiscal
naifs
will
proclaim
that
its
free
along
with
the
canadian
left
for
that
is
part
of
their
brainwashing
agenda
the
french
do
have
copayments
though
france
magazines
summer
edition
has
a
fantastic
presentation
of
their
basic
insurance
coverage
including
a
sample
chart
of
copayment
percentages
for
days
youre
covered
for
of
the
public
hospital
rate
afterward
with
extra
private
insurance
you
can
get
into
a
private
hospital
and
be
covered
for
any
differences
beyond
the
public
hospital
rate
the
public
insurance
covers
beyond
days
or
the
same
cash
amount
for
a
private
hospital
and
the
difference
is
paid
outofpocket
or
according
to
your
supplementary
private
insurance
over
of
french
have
some
form
of
extra
private
insurance
so
the
other
of
health
costs
in
europe
are
out
of
private
funds
not
gleaned
from
other
taxes
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
using
the
same
methods
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
isnt
the
private
health
insurance
industry
just
too
big
and
powerful
to
kill
dismantling
the
health
segment
of
our
insurance
industry
would
be
politically
thorny
in
the
quiet
words
of
one
advocate
for
a
national
plan
some
firms
now
sell
more
than
billion
in
health
insurance
theyd
put
up
a
hard
fight
not
only
has
the
industry
grown
eightfold
since
canada
shut
down
its
own
health
insurers
but
our
government
leaves
politicians
more
open
to
lobbyists
than
does
canadas
parliamentary
system
health
insurance
does
exist
in
canada
and
in
western
europe
its
just
that
it
doesnt
cover
basic
care
you
can
opt
out
in
canada
and
germany
but
youll
have
to
go
uninsured
as
a
result
because
there
are
too
few
other
people
that
do
so
ie
no
market
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing

low
cost

writes
there
is
never
any
mention
of
how
much
working
canadians
have
to
pay
in
taxes
for
their
free
health
care
system
oh
really
i
know
that
more
than
of
an
average
daily
workers
salary
goes
towards
taxes
in
canada
mainly
because
of
this
free
health
care
it
looks
like
we
are
pretty
lucky
so
far
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
seperately
on
my
pay
stub
while
im
not
the
only
canadian
who
favours
lower
taxes
and
cutbacks
in
spending
health
insurance
isnt
on
the
table
see
our
polls
a
better
one
might
be
the
july
polls
conducted
for
macleans
our
major
english
newsmagazine
by
decima
research
decima
president
allen
gregg
is
considered
one
of
the
worlds
top
poll
researchers
and
mulroneys
conservatives
have
relied
on
him
to
keep
in
power
in
the
face
of
impossible
election
situations
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
see
this
years
version
due
to
our
library
but
previous
ones
before
the
americans
started
their
assault
and
disinformation
had
shown
satisfaction
at
and
switching
to
an
american
allprivate
system
had
support
within
statistical
noise
the
decima
polls
are
considered
definitive
even
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
hold
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
personally
i
feel
that
the
universal
health
insurance
approach
used
in
canada
france
and
germany
paying
to
private
health
providers
in
a
nominally
free
market
not
unlike
americas
minus
hmos
depends
a
lot
on
values
in
those
societies
different
from
the
us
the
basic
health
needs
for
life
are
not
viewed
as
market
but
the
insurance
does
allow
the
market
to
address
that
basic
health
care
is
not
viewed
on
the
level
of
ownership
of
a
vcr
as
americans
would
see
it
plenty
of
room
is
left
for
expenditure
of
private
funds
as
extra
insurance
or
as
lastly
there
were
noises
about
how
the
canadian
system
was
not
containing
costs
but
in
fact
their
system
is
currently
bankrupt

explain
this
one

were

at

with

is

bill
clinton
and
id
like
to
welcome
you
to
the
area
and
to
kdka
the
president
thank
you
mike
glad
to
be
here
q
there
are
a
lot
of
things
wed
like
to
talk
about
in
the
brief
amount
of
time
we
have
but
some
news
is
just
breaking
from
los
angeles
i
guess
the
entire
country
has
been
kind
of
holding
their
breath
wondering
whats
going
to
happen
in
the
trial
of
the
four
los
angeles
police
officers
we
just
heard
that
two
of
those
officers
the
sergeant
sergeant
koon
and
officer
powell
have
been
found
guilty
and
two
officers
have
been
found
not
guilty
its
a
situation
thats
been
building
for
over
a
year
since
the
first
trial
and
now
this
trial
and
this
verdict
and
i
wonder
what
your
thoughts
are
this
morning
on
how
you
see
the
situation
in
los
angeles
in
connection
with
your
administration
and
what
youre
trying
to
do
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
think
the
american
people
should
know
that
this
trial
in
my
judgment
is
a
tribute
to
the
work
and
judgment
of
the
jury
as
well
as
to
the
efforts
of
the
federal
government
in
developing
the
case
the
law
under
which
the
officers
were
tried
is
a
complex
one
the
standards
of
proof
are
complicated
the
jury
decided
that
they
would
convict
the
sergeant
who
was
responsible
for
supervising
the
officers
and
the
officer
who
on
the
film
did
most
of
the
beating
the
jury
acquitted
an
officer
who
kicked
rodney
king
but
also
plainly
tried
to
shield
him
from
some
blows
and
another
officer
who
was
a
rookie
no
one
knows
exactly
why
they
did
what
they
did
but
it
appears
that
they
really
tried
to
do
justice
here
they
acknowledged
that
his
civil
rights
were
violated
and
i
think
that
the
american
people
should
take
a
lot
of
pride
in
that
but
i
hope
now
we
can
begin
to
look
ahead
and
focus
on
three
things
first
of
all
the
importance
of
trying
to
bring
this
country
together
and
not
violate
the
civil
rights
of
any
american
secondly
the
importance
of
renewing
our
fight
against
crime
i
think
its
important
to
recognize
that
in
the
poorest
areas
of
los
angeles
and
many
other
cities
in
this
country
people
may
be
worried
about
police
abuse
but
theyre
even
more
worried
about
crime
its
time
that
we
renewed
our
efforts
to
go
to
community
policing
put
more
police
officers
on
the
street
pass
the
brady
bill
that
would
require
a
waiting
period
before
people
could
buy
a
handgun
and
do
some
other
things
to
reduce
the
vulnerability
of
our
people
to
violence
and
drugs
and
the
last
point
id
like
to
make
is
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
got
to
rededicate
ourselves
to
the
economic
revitalization
of
our
cities
and
other
economicallydistressed
areas
if
you
just
think
about
it
if
everybody
in
los
angeles
who
wanted
a
job
had
one
i
dont
think
wed
have
quite
as
many
problems
as
we
do
and
i
laid
out
a
very
ambitious
program
in
the
campaign
to
try
to
bring
private
investment
and
public
investment
to
bear
in
our
cities
i
have
dispatched
the
commerce
secretary
ron
brown
to
california
to
try
to
come
up
with
some
strategies
for
that
state
because
its
our
biggest
state
with
our
highest
unemployment
rate
which
could
then
be
applied
around
the
country
i
want
to
talk
to
him
and
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
new
head
of
the
naacp
to
reverend
jackson
and
to
several
other
people
and
then
ill
decide
where
to
go
from
here
with
regard
to
los
angeles
and
the
other
cities
of
the
country
q
lets
talk
about
what
brings
you
to
the
pittsburgh
area
today
there
have
been
i
guess
theres
been
a
lot
of
discussion
on
capitol
hill
about
your
stimulus
package
youve
been
locked
in
a
battle
with
the
gop
yesterday
as
you
said
earlier
in
your
radio
address
you
made
some
moves
to
break
that
gridlock
what
brings
you
to
pittsburgh
in
particular
to
allegheny
county
in
particular
to
pennsylvania
with
that
battle
the
president
well
there
are
two
reasons
first
of
all
pittsburgh
allegheny
county
and
pennsylvania
supported
me
in
the
last
election
because
they
wanted
a
new
direction
in
economic
policy
we
have
passed
our
overall
economic
plan
it
gives
the
country
a
very
different
budget
for
the
next
five
years
than
weve
had
in
the
previous
we
reduced
the
deficit
and
at
the
same
time
increased
investment
in
jobs
and
education
and
health
care
in
the
things
that
will
make
us
a
stronger
country
but
in
addition
to
that
i
asked
the
congress
in
the
short
run
to
spend
a
little
more
money
a
modest
amount
of
money
to
create
another
halfmillion
jobs
in
the
next
year
and
a
half
to
try
to
cut
the
unemployment
rate
by
a
half
a
percent
but
also
to
try
to
spark
job
creation
in
the
private
sector
more
the
plan
passed
the
house
it
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
senate
at
the
present
time
all
the
republican
senators
as
a
bloc
are
filibustering
the
bill
that
is
they
wont
let
it
come
to
a
vote
i
believe
that
senator
specter
would
like
to
vote
for
the
bill
and
i
believe
that
senator
dole
the
republican
leader
has
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
a
lot
of
the
republicans
to
stay
hitched
and
theyre
all
saying
that
this
bill
increases
the
deficit
it
doesnt
this
bill
is
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
approved
including
the
republicans
for
this
year
this
bill
is
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
in
the
next
five
years
this
bill
is
designed
to
give
a
jumpstart
to
the
economy
and
i
must
say
a
lot
of
the
republican
senators
that
are
holding
it
up
when
mr
bush
was
president
voted
for
billions
of
dollars
of
emergency
spending
of
just
this
kind
much
of
it
was
totally
unrelated
to
creating
jobs
so
what
im
trying
to
do
is
to
break
this
logjam
ive
held
out
an
olive
branch
ive
offered
a
compromise
but
i
think
that
we
ought
to
try
to
put
some
more
americans
to
work
right
now
to
show
that
were
changing
the
direction
of
the
country
and
thats
the
purpose
of
the
bill
q
have
you
been
in
touch
with
senator
specter
or
his
office
lately
the
president
well
weve
been
trying
to
talk
regularly
to
through
my
white
house
congressional
liaison
operation
to
the
senators
that
we
think
are
open
to
this
senator
specter
senator
damato
from
new
york
senator
jeffords
from
vermont
senator
hatfield
from
oregon
and
five
or
six
others
whom
we
believe
know
we
need
more
jobs
in
this
economy
and
know
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
over
the
life
of
the
budget
i
presented
you
know
it
has
a
lot
of
appeal
to
say
well
weve
got
a
big
deficit
we
shouldnt
increase
it
more
but
the
truth
is
that
we
are
paying
for
this
with
budget
cuts
in
the
whole
life
of
the
budget
over
the
next
few
years
and
more
importantly
we
have
this
program
well
below
the
spending
targets
that
congress
has
already
approved
for
this
year
and
theyve
done
this
for
years
with
the
republicans
voting
for
it
many
republicans
voting
for
it
for
things
that
werent
nearly
as
important
as
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
so
i
just
hope
that
this
doesnt
become
a
political
issue
it
ought
to
just
be
about
the
people
of
this
country
and
the
need
for
jobs
q
i
have
some
questions
from
people
who
supported
you
and
some
people
who
are
skeptical
about
your
administration
it
has
to
do
with
their
hopes
and
also
with
their
fears
a
lot
of
people
who
supported
you
and
voted
for
you
in
pennsylvania
i
think
some
of
them
are
now
saying
were
glad
we
got
him
in
the
white
house
but
now
look
at
this
incredible
process
he
has
to
go
through
look
at
these
problems
look
at
this
gridlock
and
theyre
beginning
to
wonder
is
this
going
to
work
can
you
pull
it
off
and
of
course
your
skeptics
are
saying
well
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
like
this
the
president
well
what
i
would
id
ask
people
first
of
all
to
remember
that
we
are
frankly
moving
very
fast
the
budget
resolution
that
the
congress
passed
is
the
fastest
they
have
ever
passed
a
budget
resolution
ever
in
history
setting
out
the
next
fiveyear
budget
targets
so
we
are
moving
really
rapidly
and
weve
got
them
working
on
political
reform
welfare
reform
health
care
reform
a
whole
wide
range
of
things
but
its
a
big
operation
you
cant
expect
to
turn
it
around
overnight
it
took
years
to
produce
the
conditions
which
led
to
the
victory
i
received
from
the
people
in
november
and
we
cant
turn
it
around
in
days
but
i
think
were
making
real
real
progress
i
would
urge
the
people
not
to
get
discouraged
were
not
going
to
win
every
battle
and
not
everything
is
going
to
happen
overnight
but
we
are
definitely
moving
and
changing
things

you

the
president
good
morning
my
voice
is
coming
to
you
this
morning
through
the
facilities
of
the
oldest
radio
station
in
america
kdka
in
pittsburgh
im
visiting
the
city
to
meet
personally
with
citizens
here
to
discuss
my
plans
for
jobs
health
care
and
the
economy
but
i
wanted
first
to
do
my
weekly
broadcast
with
the
american
people
im
told
this
station
first
broadcast
in
when
it
reported
that
years
presidential
elections
over
the
past
seven
decades
presidents
have
found
ways
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
people
from
whistlestop
tours
to
fireside
chats
to
the
bus
tour
that
i
adopted
along
with
vice
president
gore
in
last
years
campaign
every
saturday
morning
i
take
this
time
to
talk
with
you
my
fellow
americans
about
the
problems
on
your
minds
and
what
im
doing
to
try
and
solve
them
its
my
way
of
reporting
to
you
and
of
giving
you
a
way
to
hold
me
accountable
you
sent
me
to
washington
to
get
our
government
and
economy
moving
after
years
of
paralysis
and
policy
and
a
bad
experiment
with
trickledown
economics
you
know
how
important
it
is
for
us
to
make
bold
comprehensive
changes
in
the
way
we
do
business
we
live
in
a
competitive
global
economy
nations
rise
and
fall
on
the
skills
of
their
workers
the
competitiveness
of
their
companies
the
imagination
of
their
industries
and
the
cooperative
experience
and
spirit
that
exists
between
business
labor
and
government
although
many
of
the
economies
of
the
industrialized
world
are
now
suffering
from
slow
growth
theyve
made
many
of
the
smart
investments
and
the
tough
choices
which
our
government
has
for
too
long
ignored
thats
why
many
of
them
have
been
moving
ahead
and
too
many
of
our
people
have
been
falling
behind
we
have
an
economy
today
that
even
when
it
grows
is
not
producing
new
jobs
weve
increased
the
debt
of
our
nation
by
four
times
over
the
last
years
and
we
dont
have
much
to
show
for
it
we
know
that
wages
of
most
working
people
have
stopped
rising
that
most
people
are
working
longer
work
weeks
and
that
too
many
families
can
no
longer
afford
the
escalating
cost
of
health
care
but
we
also
know
that
given
the
right
tools
the
right
incentives
and
the
right
encouragement
our
workers
and
businesses
can
make
the
kinds
of
products
and
profits
our
economy
needs
to
expand
opportunity
and
to
make
our
communities
better
places
to
live
in
many
critical
products
today
americans
are
the
low
cost
high
quality
producers
our
task
is
to
make
sure
that
we
create
more
of
those
kinds
of
jobs
just
two
months
ago
i
gave
congress
my
plan
for
longterm
jobs
and
economic
growth
it
changes
the
old
priorities
in
washington
and
puts
our
emphasis
where
it
needs
to
be
on
peoples
real
needs
on
increasing
investments
and
jobs
and
education
on
cutting
the
federal
deficit
on
stopping
the
waste
which
pays
no
dividends
and
redirecting
our
precious
resources
toward
investment
that
creates
jobs
now
and
lays
the
groundwork
for
robust
economic
growth
in
the
future
these
new
directions
passed
the
congress
in
record
time
and
created
a
new
sense
of
hope
and
opportunity
in
our
country
then
the
jobs
plan
i
presented
to
congress
which
would
create
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
most
of
them
in
the
private
sector
in
and
passed
the
house
of
representatives
it
now
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
united
states
senate
but
its
been
held
up
by
a
filibuster
of
a
minority
in
the
senate
just
senators
they
blocked
a
vote
that
they
know
would
result
in
the
passage
of
our
bill
and
the
creation
of
jobs
the
issue
isnt
politics
the
issue
is
people
millions
of
americans
are
waiting
for
this
legislation
and
counting
on
it
counting
on
us
in
washington
but
the
jobs
bill
has
been
grounded
by
gridlock
i
know
the
american
people
are
tired
of
business
as
usual
and
politics
as
usual
i
know
they
dont
want
us
to
spin
or
wheels
they
want
the
recovery
to
get
moving
so
i
have
taken
a
first
step
to
break
this
gridlock
and
gone
the
extra
mile
yesterday
i
offered
to
cut
the
size
of
this
plan
by
percent
from
billion
to
billion
its
not
what
id
hoped
for
with
million
americans
looking
for
fulltime
work
i
simply
cant
let
the
bill
languish
when
i
know
that
even
a
compromise
bill
will
mean
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
for
our
people
the
mandate
is
to
act
to
achieve
change
and
move
the
country
forward
by
taking
this
initiative
in
the
face
of
an
unrelenting
senate
talkathon
i
think
we
can
respond
to
your
mandate
and
achieve
a
significant
portion
of
our
original
goals
first
we
want
to
keep
the
programs
as
much
as
possible
that
are
needed
to
generate
jobs
and
meet
human
needs
including
highway
and
road
construction
summer
jobs
for
young
people
immunization
for
children
construction
of
waste
water
sites
and
aid
to
small
businesses
we
also
want
to
keep
funding
for
extended
unemployment
compensation
benefits
for
people
who
have
been
unemployed
for
a
long
time
because
the
economy
isnt
creating
jobs
second
ive
recommended
that
all
the
other
programs
in
the
bill
be
cut
acrosstheboard
by
a
little
more
than
percent
and
third
ive
recommended
a
new
element
in
this
program
to
help
us
immediately
start
our
attempt
to
fight
against
crime
by
providing
million
for
cities
and
towns
to
rehire
police
officers
who
lost
their
jobs
during
the
recession
and
put
them
back
to
work
protecting
our
people
im
also
going
to
fight
for
a
tough
crime
bill
because
the
people
of
this
country
need
it
and
deserve
it
now
the
people
who
are
filibustering
this
bill
the
republican
senators
say
they
wont
vote
for
it
because
it
increases
deficit
spending
because
theres
extra
spending
this
year
that
hasnt
already
been
approved
that
sounds
reasonable
doesnt
it
heres
what
they
dont
say
this
program
is
more
than
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
over
my
fiveyear
budget
and
this
budget
is
well
within
the
spending
limits
already
approved
by
the
congress
this
year
its
amazing
to
me
that
many
of
these
same
senators
who
are
filibustering
the
bill
voted
during
the
previous
administration
for
billions
of
dollars
of
the
same
kind
of
emergency
spending
and
much
of
it
was
not
designed
to
put
the
american
people
to
work
this
is
not
about
deficit
spending
we
have
offered
a
plan
to
cut
the
deficit
this
is
about
where
your
priorities
are
on
people
or
on
politics
keep
in
mind
that
our
jobs
bill
is
paid
for
dollar
for
dollar
it
is
paid
for
by
budget
cuts
and
its
the
soundest
investment
we
can
now
make
for
ourselves
and
our
children
i
urge
all
americans
to
take
another
look
at
this
jobs
and
investment
program
to
consider
again
the
benefits
for
all
of
us
when
weve
helped
make
more
american
partners
working
to
ensure
the
future
of
our
nation
and
the
strength
of
our
economy
you
know
if
every
american
who
wanted
a
job
had
one
we
wouldnt
have
a
lot
of
the
other
problems
we
have
in
this
country
today
this
bill
is
not
a
miracle
its
a
modest
first
step
to
try
to
set
off
a
job
creation
explosion
in
this
country
again
but
its
a
step
we
ought
to
take
and
it
is
fully
paid
for
over
the
life
of
our
budget
tell
your
lawmakers
what
you
think
tell
them
how
important
the
bill
is
if
it
passes
well
all
be
winners

would

are
often
pointed
out
as
nations
with

government
from
a
libertarian
point
of
view
well
let
me
help
by
explaining
the
difference
between
a
linited
government
and
a
failed
government
a
limited
government
has
its
powers
clearly
circumscribed
but
is
fully
capable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
within
those
circumscribed
areas
a
failed
government
is
incapable
of
enforcing
its
decisions
except
sporadicly
two
completely
different
beasts
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
the
argument
is
not
between
those
who
want
limited
government
and
those
who
want
unlimited
government
it
is
between
those
who
believe
government
regulation
in
a
capitalist
economy
serves
worthwhile
ends
and
those
who
believe
such
regulation
is
neither
desirable
on
empirical
grounds
nor
justifiable
on
ideological
grounds
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the

of

find
their

to

steve
hendricks
writes
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
government
regulation
is
obviously
worthwhile
the
libertarian
agenda
however
does
not
call
for
this
assessment
it
assumes
that
the
costs
of
regulation
of
any
kind
always
outweigh
its
benefits
this
approach
avoids
all
sorts
of
difficult
analysis
but
it
strikes
many
of
the
rest
of
us
as
dogmatic
to
say
the
least
i
assume
you
mean
that
analyzing
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
government
regulation
on
a
case
by
case
basis
is
worthwhile
let
me
suggest
that
this
is
not
an
option
regulators
regulate
its
what
they
do
im
not
sure
why
you
dont
consider
it
an
option
no
one
suggests
that
such
analysis
should
be
left
to
regulators
in
fact
the
reinventing
government
movement
provides
just
such
a
costbenefit
approach
to
the
analysis
of
public
spending
libertarians
would
do
well
to
learn
more
about
it
it
might
be
possible
to
pass
an
amendment
which
would
prevent
any
liscensing
laws
from
being
valid
assuming
you
could
convince
people
that
it
would
overall
be
a
good
idea
eliminating
the
liscensing
laws
which
serve
no
good
purpose
the
vast
majority
of
them
while
maintaining
the
worthwhile
ones
assuming
there
are
any
is
not
feasible
sorry
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
the
only
feasible
approach
what
is
not
feasible
is
a
wholesale
attack
on
all
government
regulation
and
licensing
that
treats
cutting
hair
and
practicing
medicine
as
equivalent
tasks
i
have
no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical
care
education
national
defense
or
local
police
that
suggests
a
free
market
can
provide
a
more
effective
efficient
means
of
accomplishing
social
objectives
than
is
provided
through
statist
approaches
with
some
notable
exceptions
however
i
do
not
see
such
nittygritty
worthwhile
analysis
being
carried
out
by
selfprofessed
libertarians
jsh
i
note
that
the
above
examples
tend
to
be
among
the
few
government
areas
likely
to
win
some
approval
among
libertarians
anyway
actually
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
above
that
strike
me
as
generating
substantial
support
among
libertarians
are
police
and
defense
it
is
an
interesting
aside
that
as
committed
as
libertarians
claim
to
be
to
a
principle
of
noncoercion
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
that
they
frequently
support
involve
hiring
people
with
gunshmmm
the
most
objectionable
government
expenditures
are
entitlements
which
also
are
the
biggest
certain
individuals
will
suggest
that
these
should
be
considered
defense
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
a
sort
of
danegeld
to
wouldbe
revolutionaries
but
i
personally
dont
feel
we
have
much
to
fear
from
an
alliance
of
geezers
and
unwed
mothers
maybe
ive
led
too
sheltered
a
life
perhaps
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consider
that
revolutionaries
frequently
generate
support
by
acting
as
protectors
of
geezers
mothers
and
children
governments
that
ignore
such
people
on
the
grounds
that
we
dont
have
much
to
fear
from
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril

we

because
hes
obviously
using
arguments
designed
to
convince
i
make
no
secret
of
what
i
am
up
to
i
have
stated
explicitly
in
posts
that
i
am
a
political
propagandist
on
numerous
occasions
anyone
posting
to
this
group
who
is
not
probably
has
the
wrong
group
for
example
i
have
on
numerous
occasions
stated
quite
clearly
that
i
beleive
that
certain
factions
of
the
gun
lobby
are
the
worst
possible
advocates
of
their
cause
and
i
am
prepared
to
do
anything
in
my
power
to
provide
them
with
a
platform
because
they
can
convince
people
far
better
than
i
could
hope
that
many
people
with
a
fixation
on
lethal
weapons
are
dangerous
and
derranged
if
you
happen
to
know
a
political
position
which
does
not
have
people
advocating
it
who
do
more
harm
than
good
please
point
it
out
some
people
have
even
accused
me
of
inventing
such
advocates
purely
for
the
purpose
of
having
them
trash
a
set
of
political
views
in
fact
this
would
be
a
futile
tactic
because
i
could
never
hope
to
invent
a
character
as
dangerous
as
sybokathenaedu
a
man
who
i
quite
seriously
believe
to
be
mentaly
ill
and
a
potential
psychopath
unfortunately
the
local
sherifs
office
have
informed
me
that
they
are
unable
to
act
untill
he
attacks
someone
one
of
the
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
requiring
proof
on
the
part
of
the
government
before
they
may
take
action
against
citizens
and
part
of
the
reason
some
of
us
believe
weapons
should
be
available
so
if
you
were
to
ask
me
what
is
the
point
that
i
am
trying
to
make
from
this
current
argument
on
the
absolute
sanctity
of
the
us
constitution
what
would
i
answer
we
are
not
arguing
the
absolute
sanctity
of
the
us
constitution
in
fact
the
fillibuster
were
talking
about
isnt
in
the
constitution
i
objected
to
your
suggestion
that
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
exercise
the
power
it
was
clearly
given
firstly
i
see
that
the
current
us
political
scene
like
the
uk
political
scene
has
become
tied
to
special
interests
rather
than
chase
the
convenient
caricatures
put
about
by
the
media
and
polititians
themselves
for
this
gay
rights
cmapaigners
environmentalists
zionists
ie
jews
foreign
lobbyists
whatever
voting
power
they
have
etc
i
sugest
that
you
look
at
who
is
really
benefiting
the
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
it
is
the
major
corporations
owned
by
the
ultrawealthy
that
have
benefited
regan
and
bush
created
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
welfare
state
for
the
rich
ill
point
out
again
that
reagan
only
had
a
republican
majority
in
the
senate
during
his
first
term
and
his
coalition
in
the
house
came
apart
at
about
the
same
time
bush
never
had
any
real
support
in
congress
the
real
point
is
that
everybody
everywhere
got
their
pork
from
the
big
corporations
to
the
guy
i
saw
last
night
leaving
a
convenience
store
with
an
armful
of
junkfood
hed
bought
with
food
stamps
he
spent
more
in
food
stamps
on
junk
than
i
make
in
a
week
and
im
not
on
government
assitance
money
was
diverted
from
programs
addressing
social
needs
and
poured
into
the
weapons
industry
in
the
form
of
cost
plus
profits
contracts
lessee
lets
pull
out
the
old
almanac
in
total
us
government
budget
outlays
were
billion
dollars
in
est
they
were
trillion
dollars
an
increase
of
approx
billion
dollars
in
national
defense
cost
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
and
increase
of
billion
dollars
that
leaves
an
increase
of
billion
dollars
unaccounted
for
this
represented
an
increase
of
in
income
security
which
includes
retirement
programs
housing
assitance
and
unemployment
benefits
and
i
believe
welfare
cost
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
or
more
than
national
defense
started
this
represented
an
increase
of
in
the
federal
government
spent
billion
dollars
on
medicare
in
they
spent
billion
dollars
an
increase
of
in
the
feds
spent
billion
dollars
on
housing
credits
and
subsidies
of
that
like
in
it
was
billion
in
health
care
services
and
research
was
billion
dollars
in
it
was
billion
dollars
agriculture
up
billion
to
billion
science
up
billion
to
billion
resource
conservation
up
billion
to
billion
education
up
billion
to
billion
veteran
benefits
up
billion
to
billion
trasnportation
up
billion
to
billion
about
the
only
things
i
see
which
was
seriously
decreased
was
under
the
energy
category
primarily
under
supply
and
community
development
in
the
area
of
disaster
relief
and
between
the
two
of
them
represent
a
loss
of
less
than
billion
dollars
where
was
this
huge
diversion
in
order
to
rectify
this
situation
there
must
be
constitutional
revision
not
thats
a
stretch
if
the
current
government
was
pushed
by
the
president
to
create
this
mess
wouldnt
one
expect
it
to
begin
to
equalize
once
the
pressure
is
gone
secondly
the
form
of
this
revision
must
take
account
of
the
changed
circumsatnces
of
the
role
of
the
federal
government
only
assuming
that
the
new
role
is
a
positive
role
we
want
to
continue
i
see
very
little
positive
about
it
the
constitution
cannot
be
used
to
frustrate
the
democratic
process
the
constitution
was
designed
to
frustrate
the
democratic
process
so
that
the
voters
could
be
absolutely
sure
they
were
getting
what
they
wanted
by
the
time
it
happened
nor
do
i
see
putting
the
brakes
on
the
democratic
process
an
inherently
bad
thing
califronias
riding
the
edge
and
every
time
they
pull
their
ballot
initiative
nonsense
it
gets
worse
if
the
peoplr
want
to
have
welfare
spending
by
the
federal
government
they
will
have
it
sometimes
or
perhaps
most
of
the
time
the
people
should
be
told
no
and
pointed
to
their
local
government
attempting
to
prevent
this
through
constitutional
trickery
only
leads
to
the
constitution
being
brought
into
disrepute
phill
would
you
do
me
the
very
great
favor
of
repeating
that
in
talkpoliticsguns
methods
will
always
be
found
to
bypass
such
provisions
and
once
the
government
gets
used
to
bypassing
those
provisions
they
will
bypass
the
others
up
to
the
first
ammendment
cute
we
can
eliminate
violations
of
the
law
by
eliminating
the
law
this
is
a
major
reason
why
the
right
to
own
guns
should
be
excluded
the
implication
that
this
right
is
equal
to
the
right
to
free
speech
is
dangerous
free
speech
alone
is
dangerous
phill
people
know
that
mass
ownership
of
lethal
weapons
causes
thousands
of
murders
a
year
the
dangerous
conclusion
they
may
reach
is
that
the
first
ammendment
may
also
be
the
same
dangerous
mistake
ok
phill
all
you
gotta
show
me
is
a
clear
pattern
of
reduction
in
homicide
rates
across
several
countries
and
thatll
be
it
not
current
mind
you
reduction
note
however
that
this
is
not
the
slippery
slope
argument
it
is
because
the
right
freedom
of
speech
has
been
chained
to
the
privilege
to
own
weaponry
that
the
danger
arises
the
advocates
of
this
pivilege
must
not
be
allowed
to
chain
freedom
of
speech
to
their
cause
such
that
if
they
fall
freedom
of
speech
falls
as
well
such
actions
are
not
the
actions
of
people
genuinely
interested
in
freedom
whos
chaining
anything
to
freedom
of
speech
by
calling
it
a
freedom
thirdly
and
most
importantly
i
want
to
discover
a
mechanism
wherby
i
can
engender
intellectual
debate
as
opposed
to
totemic
debate
i
consider
the
grave
threat
to
civilisation
to
be
the
loss
of
the
ability
to
reason
about
the
political
debate
at
anything
other
than
the
superficial
level
the
objection
i
raise
to
your
basing
your
case
entirely
on
the
assertion
of
the
supremacy
of
the
us
constitution
is
that
the
currency
of
your
argument
is
limited
to
the
currency
of
the
totem
upon
which
it
is
based
the
danger
of
totems
is
that
they
can
be
reinterpreted
in
different
ways
by
different
people
phill
youre
a
master
of
subtly
changing
the
subject
i
havent
based
my
argument
against
raw
democracy
on
the
constitution
ive
tried
to
explain
why
it
isnt
a
good
idea
the
only
time
ive
referred
to
the
constitution
is
to
point
out
it
doesnt
contain
the
restrictions
on
the
veto
and
the
senate
you
appear
to
believe
were
meant
but
just
didnt
make
it
in
there
the
constitution
doesnt
contain
the
fillibuster
rule
i
only
believe
that
the
rule
is
a
good
idea
you
cnt
dismiss
that
as
venerating
the
constitution
because
it
isnt
in
the
constitution

weird
al
subject
re
race
and
violence
joe
as
usual
this
issue
of
dysfunction
of
bad
values
of
messed
up
culture
is
easily
embraced
by
non
african
americans
when
it
comes
to
explaining
problems
in
our
community
from
your
post
you
apparently
find
the
idea
that
something
is
wrong
with
african
americans
valuewise
culture
wise
or
something
very
appealing
i
never
cease
to
be
amazed
at
how
eager
non
african
americans
are
to
embrace
theories
about
our
problems
which
basically
assert
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
the
socioeconomic
factors
which
we
know
help
to
produce
high
crime
levels
like
poverty
which
exists
among
us
in
large
proportion
i
mean
when
it
comes
to
discussion
of
african
american
problems
we
somehow
become
exempt
from
all
these
types
of
factors
and
the
problem
is
laid
at
the
doorstep
of
some
neboulous
dysfunction
we
supposedly
have
but
nobody
attributes
crime
amongst
white
americans
to
dysfunction
no
that
has
socioeconomic
factors
to
it
but
for
africa
americans
its
gotta
be
a
dysfunction
basically
i
think
this
tendency
for
non
african
americans
to
believe
that
something
is
wrong
with
us
exists
because
non
african
americans
dont
want
to
deal
with
the
possiblility
that
the
society
is
deeply
biased
against
african
americans
and
that
this
is
about
of
the
problem
it
could
not
possible
be
that
the
society
is
so
deeply
racist
and
structured
against
us
that
this
has
a
very
effective
negative
effect
on
us
no
something
is
wrong
with
us
non
african
americans
are
quick
to
disregard
what
we
have
to
say
because
they
are
so
busy
trying
to
find
something
wrong
with
us
instead
of
taking
a
good
hard
look
at
the
thing
we
say
are
doing
us
damage

steve
hendricks
writes
of
course
one
again
faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
without
having
a
complete
answer
to
this
question
i
should
think
it
obvious
that
the
first
step
should
be
to
convince
people
this
would
be
a
desirable
result
there
are
still
quite
a
lot
of
people
who
feel
that
the
command
economies
of
eastern
europe
failed
due
to
corruption
rather
than
essential
weaknesses
of
caommand
economies
and
you
still
have
a
majority
in
this
nation
that
favors
keeping
unenforced
and
unenforcible
laws
on
the
books
in
order
to
send
a
signal
it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
feel
this
way
in
the
first
place
constant
combat
isnt
particularly
conducive
to
intellectual
theorizing
also
they
tend
to
get
invaded
before
they
can
come
to
anything
like
a
stable
society
anyway
regulation
is
such
a
vauge
word
i
wouldnt
call
it
vague
id
call
it
elastic
all
regulation
is
not
necessarily
the
same
by
opposing
all
government
regulation
some
libertarians
treat
every
system
from
a
command
economy
to
those
that
regulate
relatively
free
markets
as
identical
thats
one
reason
many
of
the
rest
of
us
find
their
analysis
to
be
simplistic
umm
is
there
any
distinction
between
vague
and
elastic
in
this
context
aside
from
one
having
a
more
positive
connotation
than
the
other
at
any
rate
weve
been

nothing
that

off

a
prime
motivation
for
protecting

is
so
that
we

can
continue

in

healthily
we
just
disagree
on
what
is
necessary
to
maintaining
a
healthy

for

show
me
all
these

most
of
them
arent
and
the

we
have
had
individually
far

about

seems

i

you

i

what

they

exactly
has
mostly
all
the

life
returned
the

are

as
clean
as
they
were
before
the

are

the

you

love
canal
was
not

is
not
an

nor
even
a

nor
is
times
beach
and
tmi
and
acid
rain
killing

and
not
a

would
you
move
to
three

i
would
imagine
there
is
some

available
the
naturally
occurring
catastrophic
events
disasters
that
destroy
property
ie
hurricanes
tornados
earthquakes
do
not
usually
leave
toxic
wastes
that
prevent
people
from
rebuilding
their

there
the
manmade
disasters
oil
spills
toxic
dumping
radioactive
waste
dispersions
cause
death
and
make
an
area
unliveable
far
beyond
the
initial

there
are
actually
people
that
still
believe
love

david

if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
in
principle
no
in
practice
yes
in
principle
no
that
they
had
less
power
of
that
they
should
have
had
less
power
the
british
parliament
in
principle
has
absolute
power
so
does
the
monarch
much
of
the
stability
of
the
system
rests
on
what
is
not
defined
clearly
in
the
case
of
a
clear
abuse
by
one
side
or
the
other
the
other
side
can
act
to
remedy
the
situation
two
institutions
with
absolute
power
cute
lets
talk
practicality
shall
we
if
the
monarch
tried
to
do
something
what
would
happen
if
they
were
to
start
from
a
social
welfare
model
instead
of
the
current
no
state
subsidy
motto
they
would
be
better
placed
as
it
is
there
is
plenty
of
state
money
being
handed
out
the
problem
is
that
it
is
distributed
on
the
basis
of
power
in
congress
and
not
on
the
basis
of
actual
need
bingo
the
higher
up
the
governmental
ladder
the
less
actual
need
matters
because
political
power
can
be
concentrated
at
higher
levels
while
people
with
less
cloud
only
find
themselves
reduced
to
in
effectiveness
that
was
not
my
point
but
you
illustrated
the
problem
very
well
in
order
to
set
up
a
school
project
in
new
york
state
you
have
to
pay
off
the
other
states
with
pork
defense
contracts
agricultural
subsidies
etc
or
to
be
precise
of
the
states
since
you
need
to
beat
the
filibuster
then
why
not
simply
leave
new
yorks
education
to
new
york
i
remain
unconcinved
that
there
is
any
state
in
the
union
which
is
not
capable
of
educating
its
own
children
if
thats
what
they
want
to
do
the
point
is
of
redistribution
of
cash
from
the
poor
areas
of
the
ecconomy
to
the
rich
ones
i
am
contending
that
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
which
does
not
have
ample
wealth
if
they
choose
to
spend
it
to
run
a
perfectly
acceptable
education
system
i
further
contend
that
the
amount
of
money
being
spent
now
is
more
then
sufficient
but
is
being
spent
badly
or
vice
versa
if
you
arent
a
republican
so
tell
me
phill
were
the
republicans
also
responsible
for
some
of
the
huge
increases
in
social
programs
or
were
they
only
responsible
for
what
you
dont
like
i
contend
it
is
congress
which
is
to
blame
democrat
and
republican
alike
if
society
simply
writes
off
any
areas
of
the
country
that
is
ecconomically
weak
you
end
up
with
a
basket
case
ecconomy
there
are
inevitable
cycles
in
any
business
some
of
these
act
in
phase
to
produce
the
business
cycle
others
are
countercyclic
localities
can
experience
boom
to
bust
cycles
outside
the
national
trend
to
produce
a
strong
ecconomy
you
need
to
ensure
that
the
bust
areas
do
not
fall
bellow
the
level
where
they
cannot
be
ecconomically
rebuilt
most
of
our
worst
areas
are
still
better
off
than
most
of
europe
in
any
case
were
talking
about
education
if
the
industry
in
an
area
collapses
the
us
as
a
whole
still
has
a
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
children
in
that
area
get
a
good
education
in
some
areas
of
the
us
schools
are
closing
halfway
through
the
year
for
lack
of
money
yes
i
live
in
once
such
area
youre
woefully
ignorant
of
the
situation
at
the
same
time
some
of
tennessees
school
districts
are
closing
down
the
governor
asked
for
million
dollars
for
bicentenntial
celebration
license
plats
in
almost
the
same
breath
he
wanted
to
raise
unemployment
compensation
and
reduce
taxes
which
paid
into
it
i
dont
know
about
the
rest
of
the
country
but
our
education
problems
stem
directly
from
two
problems
neither
of
which
are
a
lack
of
money
in
the
state
btw
tennessee
is
considered
a
tax
heaven
and
our
economy
is
one
of
the
strongest
in
the
country
i
see
a
correlation
what
money
we
spend
goes
primarly
to
administration
the
average
administrator
makes
two
and
a
half
times
what
the
average
teacher
makes
and
sucks
up
an
enormous
amount
of
revenue
and
the
governor
is
making
a
concerted
effort
to
create
an
education
crisis
in
order
to
push
for
his
pet
income
tax
some
of
the
most
idiotic
programs
get
funded
like
state
funds
for
new
art
in
the
county
seat
while
schools
are
closing
its
not
a
lack
of
funds
its
an
unwillingness
to
spend
them
on
what
is
more
appropriate
education
is
the
parental
hotbutton
education
is
always
the
first
to
but
cut
because
its
easier
to
get
people
to
pay
for
their
children
than
ugly
art
the
us
constitution
is
a
nutsandbolts
document
the
delcaration
of
independence
was
the
highbrow
reasoning
there
are
a
couple
of
other
examples
though
such
as
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
tax
and
the
reasoning
for
the
power
to
grant
permits
both
in
article
i
section
the
declaration
on
independence
cam
a
decade
earlier
and
has
not
a
line
of
justification
for
the
us
constitution
you
could
argue
that
it
went
into
the
broad
concepts
but
little
more
it
spoke
very
eloquently
on
government
being
based
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
in
fact
it
is
little
more
than
a
protracted
whinge
more
to
do
with
the
price
of
tea
than
the
design
of
a
government
it
would
be
a
pretty
daft
idea
for
a
bunch
of
guys
to
sit
arround
designing
the
structure
of
the
new
government
while
the
little
matter
of
the
british
army
remained
to
be
settled
they
did
it
anyway
the
continental
congress
had
its
own
set
of
bylaws
it
wasnt
quite
a
government
but
a
means
of
making
decisions
had
to
be
created
however
low
george
washingtons
opinion
of
them
were
to
a
certain
extend
i
do
believe
the
veto
has
become
something
it
wasnt
intended
however
i
also
believe
it
is
inevitable
considering
the
congress
own
abuse
of
their
power
to
make
bills
say
whatever
they
want
them
to
say
unlike
most
people
i
think
we
shouldnt
be
worrying
about
the
veto
which
is
fine
but
of
the
problem
in
congress
which
almost
necessitates
its
abuse
the
congress
is
the
most
democratic
body
in
the
whole
system
allow
me
again
to
speak
heresy
against
the
holy
democratic
orders
so
what
the
government
was
built
with
a
very
nondemocratic
presidency
with
fairly
broad
powers
including
the
veto
it
has
not
only
the
fairest
system
of
election
but
the
two
year
term
means
that
the
members
have
always
got
a
recent
mandate
yes
and
the
senate
was
intended
to
act
as
a
balance
to
this
too
much
democracy
was
intentionally
avoided
it
was
considered
a
good
thing
to
place
nondemocratic
blocks
to
impulsive
action
on
the
other
hand
if
the
period
of
election
were
to
be
made
years
in
antiphase
to
the
presidential
cycle
there
would
be
much
less
dependence
on
fund
raising
from
special
interests
than
there
is
at
present
so
long
as
congress
has
something
to
sell
people
will
pay
for
it
most
congressmen
rake
in
more
money
than
they
need
why
not
what
is
inherently
wrong
with
biasing
the
system
against
action
historically
governemnt
action
in
the
us
when
dealing
with
issues
with
a
bare
minority
and
a
large
minority
have
not
been
successful
when
youre
in
a
position
of
imposing
federal
power
on
diverse
people
why
should
the
federal
government
not
have
to
got
through
something
more
than
a
bare
majority
in
other
words
david
thinks
that
the
reactionaries
should
need
only
votes
while
progressives
should
need
no
if
the
progressives
dont
want
the
reactionaries
to
move
backward
they
get
the
same
benefit
of
the
states
is
a
lot
of
people
and
historically
laws
with
that
sort
of
minority
arent
very
effective
especially
since
it
is
usually
geographically
concentrated
when
wielding
the
federal
big
stick
i
dont
see
why
they
shouldnt
have
to
make
a
better
argument
than
more
people
than
not
agree
now
we
know
why
nobody
calls
the
republicans
democrats
im
not
a
republican
im
a
republican
and
no
im
neither
a
democrat
nor
a
democrat
now
ive
asked
several
times
and
all
youve
done
is
answer
it
isnt
democratic
which
i
knew
before
i
said
it
why
should
it
be
democratic
we
dont
have
a
true
direct
democracy
and
few
people
advocate
one
why
then
is
this
other
modification
of
democracy
to
bias
it
against
action
so
much
worse

pt

gary

dare
writes
the
difference
in
the
litigation
environment
is
reflected
in
the
fees
lack
of
defensive
medicine
and
nearabsence
of
malpractice
is
really
why
we
spend
less
using
the
most
expensive
approach
of
pure
insurance
then
why
do
we
really
need
national
health
insurance
then
wouldnt
it
just
make
more
sense
to
find
some
way
to
cut
down
on
the
cost
of
malpractice
insurance
and
maybe
thats
not
such
a
good
thing
i
also
read
somewhere
that
it
is
next
to
impossible
in
canada
to
litigate
against
the
health
systemclass
action
suits
are
nearly
impossible
and
you
cant
sue
the
provincial
health
officials
at
all
part
of
the
deal
for
using
the
allinsurance
approach
like
the
french
and
germans
do
hey
why
dont
they
criticize
france
and
germany
is
it
because
too
many
people
take
french
and
german
in
college
to
make
the
accusations
stick
was
to
preserve
the
doctors
independance
since
the
provincial
wings
of
the
cma
are
the
ones
that
go
to
bat
when
the
fee
schedule
hikes
are
presented
the
politicallybent
doctors
were
just
cackling
when
they
realized
the
cma
would
grow
in
strength
rather
than
diminish
especially
when
unopposed
unlike
in
socialized
medicine
approaches
like
britains
national
health
service
oh
no
dont
let
the
ama
know
about
this
they
have
enough
power
as
it
is
ask
most
americans
whether
theyd
like
the
doctors
lobby
to
get
more
powerful
for
nonlife
threatening
things
market
arguments
adequately
cover
why
certain
procedures
are
in
scarcer
demand
i
have
md
friends
who
cant
make
a
living
as
specialists
back
in
manitoba
not
due
to
the
insurance
rates
but
because
they
wont
get
enough
customers
the
cma
medical
monopolys
grip
on
doctors
licencing
as
in
the
us
aside
so
they
must
move
to
larger
places
however
this
does
not
refute
debunking
of
waiting
lines
for
urgent
and
routine
care
as
has
been
done
in
the
us
by
consumers
reports
health
policy
studies
cited
by
prof
dennis
e
shea
on
usenet
cnn
nyt
etc
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
theoretically
its
limited
to
service
personnel
but
some
studies
ive
heard
about
have
suggested
that
about
half
the
patients
there
are
civilians
who
not
only
have
connections
but
arent
urgent
at
all
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
the
figure
of
percentage
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistry
and
optometry
were
included
in
the
accounting
maybe
canada
spends
proportionately
just
as
much
on
health
care
as
we
do
of
course
the
one
thing
to
note
is
that
in
the
canadafrancegermany
case
private
insurance
offloaded
the
basic
coverage
to
the

what
happens

systems
financially
collapse
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warned
ontarians
a
few
years
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossborder
shopping
in
such
huge
numbers
the
services
they
expect
from
the
province
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
years
fortunately
for
them
and
less
fortunately
for
the
retailers
here
in
western
new
york
the
canadian
dollar
went
back
to
a
more
realistic
value
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
what
would
happen
if
his
warning
turned
out
to
be
the
truth
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
wouldnt
free
care
encourage
people
to
run
to
the
doctor
for
every
ache
and
pain
people
who
get
free
treatment
do
go
to
the
doctor
and
hospital
about
a
third
more
often
than
those
who
have
to
pay
a
share
of
their
medical
bills
still
canadians
who
pay
nothing
at
the
doctors
have
a
lower
perperson
health
bill
than
we
do
it
is
free
in
that
there
are
no
deductibles
nor
copayments
two
things
which
i
advocate
to
make
the
canadian
insurance
look
more
like
real
health
insurance
which
actually
it
is
i
know
that
when
working
in
alberta
ontario
and
quebec
i
was
aware
that
i
was
paying
for
health
insurance
eg
in
toronto
ohip
fees
were
listed
on
my
pay
stub
manitoba
did
not
collect
at
paycheque
time
but
only
annually
at
income
tax
time
built
into
the
tax
rate
only
fiscal
naifs
will
proclaim
that
its
free
along
with
the
canadian
left
for
that
is
part
of
their
brainwashing
agenda
would
that
it
were
free
americans
would
start
another
revolution
if
they
had
to
pay
taxes
at
canadian
rates
isnt
the
private
health
insurance
industry
just
too
big
and
powerful
to
kill
dismantling
the
health
segment
of
our
insurance
industry
would
be
politically
thorny
in
the
quiet
words
of
one
advocate
for
a
national
plan
some
firms
now
sell
more
than
billion
in
health
insurance
theyd
put
up
a
hard
fight
not
only
has
the
industry
grown
eightfold
since
canada
shut
down
its
own
health
insurers
but
our
government
leaves
politicians
more
open
to
lobbyists
than
does
canadas
parliamentary
system
health
insurance
does
exist
in
canada
and
in
western
europe
its
just
that
it
doesnt
cover
basic
care
you
can
opt
out
in
canada
and
germany
but
youll
have
to
go
uninsured
as
a
result
because
there
are
too
few
other
people
that
do
so
ie
no
market
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing
routine
low
cost
parts
of
that
provinces
public
health
insurance
plan
again
i
doubt
americans
would
like
giving
the
insurance
companies
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insurers
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinces
and
the
federal
government
years
ago
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
public
system
going
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterwards
they
could
clean
up
okay
this
sort
of
contradicts
what
i
said
higher
up
but
its
another
possibility
theyd
have
an
added
bonus
when
arguing
against
government
involvement
in
their
industryas
they
could
then
point
to
its
failure

that
economic

from
there
to
social

you
go

again
poverty
is
the
main
engine
of
social

in
this
context
well
put
aside
religious
turmoil
mass
migrations
etc
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
poverty
is
imperfectly
related
to
social
and
political
instability
while
economic
inequality
is
much
more
strongly
related
in
virtually
all
major
revolutions
including
england
the
puritan
revolution
france
russia
and
china
the
revolutions
occurred
as
economies
were
undergoing
substantial
long

growth
and
poverty
was
declining
what
sets
off
revolutions
is
massive
inequality
coupled
with
a
perception
on
the
part
of
those
at

that

is
possible

if

ordain

im
surprised
you
missed
it
its
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at

through
the

you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
was
a
good
try
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advice
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
does
read
as
you
have
quoted
but
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a
binding
part
of
the
constitution
and
carries
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortured
paragraph
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
passages
in
the
english
language
witness
the
legions
of
blowhards
like
yourself
who
think
those
vague
flowery
phrases
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
really
believe
that
a
politician
only
has
to
give
lip
service
to
promoting
the
general
welfare
to
be
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of
the
constitution
article
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay

collect
taxesto
pay
the

and
provide

the

and
general

of
the

i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
just
to
make
sure
youve
got
the
point
lets
do
a
little
experiment
what
if
the
constitution
read
as
follows
preamble
we
the
people
to
promote
the
general
welfare
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united

of
america
constitution
the
federal
government
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
only
to
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
nation
but
as
noted
above
the
constitution
doesnt
say
that
does
it
the
government
would
not
then
have
two
functions
defense
and
welfare
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in

i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions

suits

nearly

and
you
cant

since
our

that

tell

medical

outside
ottawa
theoretically
its

some
studies
ive

have
suggested
that
about
half
the

there
are
civilians
who
not

have
connections
but
arent
urgent
at
all
it
serves
the

how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
people
of
influence
will
get
their
way
in
any
system
american
or
european
its
the
golden
rule
he
who
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
as
for
annual
budgets
those
are
actually
annual
grants
for
facilities
eg
mops
pans
etc
given
to
hospitals
of
which
most
are
private
nonprofit
foundations
btw
i
have
no
problem
with
having
aggressive
forprofit
hospitals
like
the
french
who
use
our
approach
but
in
the
paris
region
they
have
almost
as
many
people
as
canada
does
so
their
market
is
much
more
diverse
the
rest
has
to
be
made
up
for
by
billings
from
patients
who
use
their
services
wouldnt
national
health
insurance
mean
that
americans
who
are
now
fully
insured
might
have
to
settle
for
less
in
canada
provincial
insurance
covers
all
health
costs
except
dental
care
eyeglasses
prescription
drugs
ambulance
service
and
private
hospital
rooms
so
many
canadians
do
end
up
buying
some
private
insurance
a
policy
to
cover
all
of
these
things
runs
about
to
a
month
hmm
how
much
difference
would
it
make
in
the
figure
of
percentage
of
gnp
spent
on
health
care
if
dentistry
and
optometry
were
included
in
the
accounting
maybe
canada
spends
proportionately
just
as
much
on
health
care
as
we
do
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
and
are
compiled
use
the
same
methods
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
how
they
are
collecting
premiums
and
im
an
advocate
of
having
copayments
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
in
order
to
make
it
look
more
like
the
real
insurance
that
it
is
the
private
doctors
and
hospitals
will
still
be
there
after
the
insurance
hypothically
disappears
as
they
were
there
before
it
appeared
bob
rae
the
second
least
popular
man
in
ontario
warned
ontarians
a
few
years
ago
that
if
they
didnt
stop
crossborder
shopping
in
such
huge
numbers
the
services
they
expect
from
the
province
just
wont
be
there
in
a
few
years
for
one
thing
i
think
that
bob
rae
is
an
idiot
he
didnt
say
so
but
i
knew
he
meant
the
ohip
most
of
ohip
comes
from
separate
premiums
on
your
paycheck
if
you
are
a
player
he
wants
to
spend
our
money
on
other
things
than
the
health
insurance
our
high
taxes
are
high
for
other
spending
but
health
insurance
which
is
separate
and
optional
and
it
is
being
spent
in
a
nonpartisan
manner
by
every
party
ohip
is
just
a
health
insurance
plan
it
does
not
provide
any
kind
of
health
care
that
is
up
to
you
and
your
private
doctors
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
some
of
the
companies
providing
extra
insurance
are
subsidiaries
of
american
companies
and
their
parents
provide
full
insurance
down
here
regardless
all
firms
up
north
can
easily
turn
on
cable
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firms
are
doing
by
being
involved
in
basic
coverage
the
private
firms
are
making
too
much
money
after
having
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverage
they
run
around
patting
them
selves
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooperation
in
providing
extras
for
those
people
who
deserve
it
when
private
insurance
realized
how
much
money
theyd
make
without
the
risks
involved
in
basic
insurance
eg
neurosurgery
versus
deluxe
amenities
eg
having
to
call
granada
tv
to
replace
a
rental
set
on
the
fritz
in
someones
private
hospital
room
they
started
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
social
responsibility
in
quebec
last
spring
a
consortium
of
private
insurers
publicly
warned
against
any
thoughts
of
privatizing
routine
low
cost
parts
of
that
provinces
public
health
insurance
plan
again
i
doubt
americans
would
like
giving
the
insurance
companies
that
much
power
i
half
wonder
if
the
canadian
health
insurers
didnt
go
along
with
the
provinces
and
the
federal
government
years
ago
because
they
knew
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
public
system
going
bust
in
the
long
run
and
then
afterwards
they
could
clean
up
okay
this
sort
of
contradicts
what
i
said
higher
up
but
its
another
possibility
theyd
have
an
added
bonus
when
arguing
against
government
involvement
in
their
industryas
they
could
then
point
to
its
failure
instead
of
just
citing
theoretical
principles
i
agree
they
were
in
a
winwin
situation
but
right
now
it
seems
that
they
have
won
bigger
when
you

faces
the
question
of
how
one
circumscribes
government
power
and
keeps
it
circumscribed
in
a
complex
society
when
it
is
in
the
interest
of
neither
capitalists
nor
consumers
to
refrain
from
using
government
power
for
their
own
ends
but
apart
from
that
little
conundrum
this
is
a
difficult
problem
for
which
there
is
no
obviously
good
solution
one
approach
is
simply
to
try
and
move
political
opinion
and
hope
a
new
more
libertarian
consensus
lasts
for
a
while
another
approach
is
to
try
and
amend
the
constitution
the
original
constitution
restrained
the
us
government
from
economic
intervention
for
to
years
depending
on
just
how
one
wants
to
count
it
the
first
amendment
though
weakened
in
many
ways
still
restrains
government
particularly
state
and
local
even
though
on
many
particular
issues
the
majority
is
in
favor
of
censorship
i
think
libertarians
would
be
happy
with
another
years
of
restraint
via
an
amendment
or
two
not
that
i
think
thats
likely
to
happen
not
necessarily
mr
hendricks
but
other
posters
seem
to
see
this
as
a
problem
with
libertarianism
that
it
cannot
be
stable
that
might
be
true
but
it
is
not
an
objection
to
libertarianism
per
se
if
a
libertarian
political
consensus
forms
for
a
decade
or
two
and
then
falls
apart
again
we
would
just
be
back
where
we
are
now
this
is
unlike
the
case
for
socialism
where
a
socialist
consensus
that
held
for
a
while
and
then
fell
apart
would
not
leave
us
where
we
are
now
but
instead
with
lots
of
bureaucracy
that
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
if

tyranny

as

the

estimates
that
its

is
about

per

thats
about
of
the
total
current

and
the
estimate
is
from
a
group
that
could
be

the

on

as

as
this
is
in

it
would
seem
that
a
society
with
a
failed
government
would
be
an
ideal
setting
for
libertarian
ideals
to
be
implemented
now
why
do
you
suppose
that
never
seems
to
occur
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
feel
this
way
in
the
first
place
constant
combat
isnt
particularly
conducive
to
intellectual
theorizing
also
they
tend
to
get
invaded
before
they
can
come
to
anything
like
a
stable
society
anyway
and
the
reason
that
the
soviet
union
couldnt
achieve
the
ideal
of
pure
communism
was
the
hostility
of

huh

this

youre

proving

i
never
felt
that
way
in
the
first
place
quite
the
contrary
i
think
a
better
proving
ground
would
be
someplace
that
already
had
a
governemnt
that
would
prevent
outright
acts
of
agression
yet
had
a
strong
spirit
of

about

out
who

that
took

and

im
curious
why
you
think
that
particular

is
important
im
curious
why
you
took
a
beign
statement
and
crossposted
it
to
several
different
news
groups
including
something
along
the
lines
of
altdiscrimination
exsqueeze
me
i
saw
your
original
post
in

your

was
crossposted
to
three

my

was
crossposted
to
two
of
those
three
omitting

now
instead
of
engaging
in

off
the

could
you
answer
the
question
posed
if
your
statement
is
so
beign
you
should
have
no
trouble
politely
responding
to
a
polite
query
well
i
dont
think
your
query
was
exactly
polite
but
i
will
try
to
give
you
a
polite
responce
something
atypical
of
the
net
but
here
it
goes
black
is
a
descriptive
adjective
that
describes
mr
king
from
many
of
the
newspaper
radio
and
tv
news
reports
i
have
seen
this
adjective
is
commonly
in
front
of
his
name
i
have
never
seen
anyone
complain
about
the
use
of
this
adjective
when
used
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr
king
was
a
no
good
black
i
do
not
know
mr
king
and
would
not
make
this
ascertian
without
some
evidence
to
this
effect
i
used
it
purely
as
a
descriptive
adjective
in
the
same
manner
than
many
most
news
people
have
used
it
in
the
past
the
entire
second
trial
was
about
race
ted
i
dont
feel
compelled
to
discuss
mr
kings
racial
background
but
had
mr
king
been
white
there
would
not
have
been
a
second
trial
you
probably
are
saying
that
the
beating
would
not
have
occurred
if
he
were
white
but
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
call
to
make
it
is
possible
the
case
but
not
definately
i
still
think
your
actions
are
crap
ted
they
are
far
more
divisive
than
me
using
the
adjective
black
in
a
nonderogenory
manner
would
you
have
been
happier
if
i
had
used
africanamerican
if
so
then
you
really
are
lost
in
the
world
of
pc
you
have
already
been
instrumental
in
getting
one
persons
net

revoked

wonder
if
you

im
not
sure
why
you
dont
consider
it
an
option
no
one
suggests
that
such
analysis
should
be
left
to
regulators
in
fact
the
reinventing
government
movement
provides
just
such
a
costbenefit
approach
to
the
analysis
of
public
spending
libertarians
would
do
well
to
learn
more
about
it
okay
let
me
try
to
explain
this
when
one
votes
for
such
a
creature
as
a
senator
or
worse
yet
a
president
one
votes
not
for
specific
policies
but
for
a
general
package
which
must
cover
all
issues
for
or
years
as
such
ones
influence
is
highly
diluted
i
might
add
that
even
if
one
were
free
to
vote
on
individual
regulations
the
vast
amount
of
time
required
for
considering
a
particular
regulation
combined
with
the
very
small
chance
of
ones
vote
making
a
difference
would
make
it
unreasonable
to
expect
the
voter
to
make
an
intelligent
decision
with
respect
to
specific
regulations
sorry
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
the
only
feasible
approach
what
is
not
feasible
is
a
wholesale
attack
on
all
government
regulation
and
licensing
that
treats
cutting
hair
and
practicing
medicine
as
equivalent
tasks
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
feasible
in
this
case
do
you
mean
that
are
impossible
in
priciple
or
merely
that
it
would
be
undesirable
in
fact
actually
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
above
that
strike
me
as
generating
substantial
support
among
libertarians
are
police
and
defense
of
the
four
you
saw
fit
to
mention
and
education
of
minors
is
always
another
possibility
since
minors
are
generally
considered
not
to
be
responsible
to
make
their
own
decisions
as
adults
are
it
is
an
interesting
aside
that
as
committed
as
libertarians
claim
to
be
to
a
principle
of
noncoercion
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
that
they
frequently
support
involve
hiring
people
with
gunshmmm
you
say
this
as
if
it
were
surprising
yet
in
fact
a
necessary
consequence
of
libertarian
philosophy
all
noncoersive
functions
should
be
dealt
with
privately
therefore
it
follows
that
the
only
functions
remaining
to
the
state
are
the
coersive
ones
perhaps
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consider
that
revolutionaries
frequently
generate
support
by
acting
as
protectors
of
geezers
mothers
and
children
governments
that
ignore
such
people
on
the
grounds
that
we
dont
have
much
to
fear
from
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril
much
more
likely
its
drunken
teenagers
the
groups
in
questionare
more
likely
to
be
worse
off
during
and
after
a
revolution
than
before
in
the
unlikely
event
that
you
missed
my
earlier
sarcasm
let
me
say
this
directly
the
idea
that
such
programs
as
social
security
or
afdc
should
be
considered
defense
an
idea
which
has
been
advanced
in
ths
and
other
newsgroups
is
so
absurd
a
lie
as
to
be
unworthy
of
consideration
do
you
seriously
dispute
this
i
dont
want
to
seem
patronizing
but
you
still
seem
to
be
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
under
a
socialized
economic
system
it
is
reasonably
intelligent
and
honest
persons
like
yourself
who
make
the
decisions
i
feel
any
third
party
added
to
a
transaction
is
every
bit
as
likely
to
be
ignorant
or
corrupt
as
the
buyer
or
seller
i
dont
expect
you
to
agree
with
me
but
you
explain
why
you

a

good

the

asked
the

questions
like
what
kind
of
sexual
perversions
do
you
participate
in
and
you
think
he
made

id
really
like
to
see
a
transcript
of
this
trial
id
especially
like
to
know
what
happened
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
that
question
assuming
that
the
reports
that
he
did
so
are
accurate
im
not
accusing
tom
farrell
of
making
anything
up
but
this
is
the
sort
of
case
that
spawns
garbled
misquotes
false
rumors
and
urban
legends
like
tribbles
itd
be
nice
to
think
that
the
prosecutor
objected
irrelevant
prejudicial
inflammatory
take
your
pick
and
that
the
judge
upheld
the
objection
i
did
hear
this
question
asked
during
a
radio
news
update
of
the
case
they
were
talking
about
the
ongoing
trial
and
had
some
audio
clips
immediately
after
the
defense
attorney
asked
the
question
there
was
an
objection
heard
in
the
background
the
clip
ended
at
that
point
so
i
dont
know
if
the
objection
was
upheld
i
cant
imagine
nc
is
that
bad
the
arresting
officer
said
the
bastards
told
him
they
did
it
on
purpose
and
hoped
the
victim
would
die
and
you
think
the
defense
made
a
good
case
no
wonder
were
losing
were
aparently
not
trying
to
win
again
id
like
to
see
the
transcript
id
read
the
latter
bit
of
that
in
the
news
media
the
arresting
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
calmly
asked
him
about
the
condition
of
the
homo
and
said
that
he
hoped
hed
die
but
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
of
the
officer
testifying
that
one
of
the
defendants
actually
said
that
he
did
anything
at
all
let
alone
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
this
i
didnt
hear
as
an
audio
clip
but
heard
it
reported
a
number
of
times
on
news
stories
both
during
and
after
the
trial
now
the
we
did
it

thing
is

preferably
some
proof
of
this
ie
newspaper
articles
documenting
such
allegations
etc
well
your
ignorance
about
this
is
unsurprising
given
youre
a
canadian
and
im
at
a
complete
loss
at
to
why
you
should
be
so
interested
in
this
given
that
it
is
an
american
issue
which
should
properly
be
of
absolutely
no
concern
to
you
at
all
actually
my
interest
in
gender
issues
is
not
limited
to
international
boundaries
indeed
i
often
exchange
information
with
americans
about
issues
which
concern
us
in
both
countries
in
any
event
in
answer
to
your
question
the
following
is
taken
from
david

article
the
real
anita

published
in
the
march
issue
of
theamericanspectator
this
is
taken
from
page
ahsomeone
had
mentioned
this
journal
but
gave
no
further
information
but
the
most
bizarre
incident
is
alleged
to
have
happened
in
the
school
year
at
oral
roberts
university
according
to
a
sworn
affidavit
dated
october
and
filed
with
the
senate
judiciary
committee
in
which
lawrence
shiles
now
a
lawyer
in
tulsa
recounted
the
following
shortly
after
the
class
had
begun
professor
hill
gave
us
a
written
assignment
which
i
completed
and
duly
turned
in
when
this
assignment
was
passed
out
to
the
class
after
having
been
marked
by
the
professor
sitting
next
to
me
were
fellow
students
jeffrey
londoff
and
mark
stewart
upon
opening
the
assignments
and
reviewing
our
grades
and
comments
made
by
anita
hill
i
found
ten
to
twelve
short
black
pubic
hairs
in
the
pages
of
my
assignment
i
glanced
over
at
jeff
londoffs
assignment
and
saw
similar
pubic
hairs
in
his
work
at
the
time
i
made
the
statement
to
londoff
that
either
she
had
a
low
opinion
of
our
work
or
she
had
graded
our
assignment
in
the
bathroom
mark
stewart
overheard
the
conversation
and
said
that
he
had
similar
pubic
hairs
in
his
assignment
also
this
became
the
standing
joke
among
many
students
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
in
classes
other
students
in
that
class
confirmed
the
story
londoff
says
he
couldnt
be
certain
that
the
hairs
were
pubic
but
he
said
he
thought
it
was
unlikely
that
they
could
have
come
from
hills
head
since
they
were
short
coarse
and
curly
and
hill
had
had
the
hair
on
her
head
straightened
another
student
who
saw
the
hair
but
did
not
want
to
be
identified
said
of
its
origins
you
just
know
when
you
see
it
does
this
satisfy
you
yes
thank
you
though
i
am
really
curious
as
to
why
this
never
came
out
at
least
not
in
what
i
saw
up
here
in
canada
or
on
cnn
which
is
sent
up
here
during
the
thomas
nomination
hearings
surely
one
would
think
that
her
claim
to
having
been
sexually
harassed
would
have
a
great
deal
less
credibility
if
it
could
be
shown
that
she
had
herself
been
guilty
of
it
or
do
you
regard
sworn
statements
given
to
a
us
senate
committee
as
equivalent
to
toilet
paper
ahemmm
it
depends
for
instance
if
it
were
the
sworn
statements
at
the
warren
commission
then
yes
i
would
say
that
the
statements
were
no
better
than
toilet
paper
used
at
that

in

the

respect
to
specific
regulations
im
afraid
that
ive
lost
the
thread
here
i
didnt
suggest
that
all
government
regulations
be
subject
to
referenda
so
i
dont
follow
the
comments
above
sorry
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
the
only
feasible
approach
what
is
not
feasible
is
a
wholesale
attack
on
all
government
regulation
and
licensing
that
treats
cutting
hair
and
practicing
medicine
as
equivalent
tasks
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
feasible
in
this
case
do
you
mean
that
are
impossible
in
priciple
or
merely
that
it
would
be
undesirable
in
fact
i
mean
that
an
ideology
that
treats
all
government
regulation
as
equally
undesirable
and
seeks
to
abolish
all
regulations
is
unlikely
to
draw
support
among
more
than
a
miniscule
portion
of
the
electorate
furthermore
i
am
suggesting
that
such
a
plan
is
not
feasible
in
an
industrial
society
because
the
weight
of
litigation
andor
misery
it
would
produce
would
effectively
crush
productive
effort
actually
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
above
that
strike
me
as
generating
substantial
support
among
libertarians
are
police
and
defense
it
is
an
interesting
aside
that
as
committed
as
libertarians
claim
to
be
to
a
principle
of
noncoercion
the
only
areas
of
public
spending
that
they
frequently
support
involve
hiring
people
with
gunshmmm
you
say
this
as
if
it
were
surprising
yet
in
fact
a
necessary
consequence
of
libertarian
philosophy
all
noncoersive
functions
should
be
dealt
with
privately
therefore
it
follows
that
the
only
functions
remaining
to
the
state
are
the
coersive
ones
no
im
not
surprised
i
just
think
its
interesting
that
on
one
hand
libertarians
assume
a
limited
government
can
be
decreed
yet
on
the
other
posit
an
entire
government
made
up
of
people
who
carry
guns
i
realize
that
many
libertarians
assume
that
such
a
government
will
be
counterbalanced
by
a
fully
armed
citizenry
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
widespread
civilian
ownership
of
guns
does
not
necessarily
prevent
the
establishment
of
totalitarian
government
eg
iraq
perhaps
you
have
may
i
suggest
that
you
consider
that
revolutionaries
frequently
generate
support
by
acting
as
protectors
of
geezers
mothers
and
children
governments
that
ignore
such
people
on
the
grounds
that
we
dont
have
much
to
fear
from
them
do
so
at
their
own
peril
much
more
likely
its
drunken
teenagers
the
groups
in
questionare
more
likely
to
be
worse
off
during
and
after
a
revolution
than
before
in
the
unlikely
event
that
you
missed
my
earlier
sarcasm
let
me
say
this
directly
the
idea
that
such
programs
as
social
security
or
afdc
should
be
considered
defense
an
idea
which
has
been
advanced
in
ths
and
other
newsgroups
is
so
absurd
a
lie
as
to
be
unworthy
of
consideration
do
you
seriously
dispute
this
yup
sure
do
but
since
i
also
support
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
government
provide
for
the
general
welfare
article
i
section
im
willing
to
justify
such
programs
on
that
basis
i
dont
want
to
seem
patronizing
but
you
still
seem
to
be
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
under
a
socialized
economic
system
it
is
reasonably
intelligent
and
honest
persons
like
yourself
who
make
the
decisions
i
feel
any
third
party
added
to
a
transaction
is
every
bit
as
likely
to
be
ignorant
or
corrupt
as
the
buyer
or
seller
i
dont
expect
you
to
agree
with
me
but
you
explain
why
you
feel
im
wrong
well
in
the
first
place
i
dont
support
a
socialized
economic
system
i
think
within
limits
that
capitalism
is
a
fine
idea
but
it
is
not
the
case
that
any
third
partyisas
likely
to
be
ignorant
or
corrupt
as
the
buyer
or
seller
there
are
multitudes
of
examples
where
such
a
statement
is
demonstrably
false
regulation
of
stock
market
transactions
that
provide
a
reasonable
basis
for
buyers
to
avoid
fraud
is
only
one

what

we

black
is
a

i
have
seen
this
adjective
is
commonly
in

of
his
name
i
have
never
seen
anyone
complain
about
the
use
of
this
adjective
when
used
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr

good
black
i
do
not

would
not

this

i
used
it
purely
as
a
descriptive
adjective
in
the

manner
than
many
most

people
have
used
it
in
the

no
one
is
questioning
whether
mr

is
black
the
question
arises
whether
kings
race
should
make
police
officers
afraid

your

seems
to
imply
that

should
have
a

i

they

up

that

i

theres
just

whether
they
did

they
did

they
wanted
to

up
on

they
were

is
another

i
have

how
about
the
fact
that
you
have
a

putting
their

day

yeah
did
you
watch

up

the

sorry
the

both
was
when

sit

i
have
to
agree
with
you
the
police
may
have
carried
it
a
bit
too
far
but
rodney
king
was
no
angel
either
and
i
dont
think
any
guilty
verdicts
should
have
been
returned
im
sure
you
know
why
they
handed
down
guilty
verdicts
on
two
of
the
officers
its
quite
simple
really
it
was
a
compromise
to
avoid
rioting
in

minorities
think
its

riot
i
hate

it

often
conflicting

what

improving

better

there

that

have
a

in

let
me
try
to
put
it
another
way
libertarians
believe
that
an
unconstrained
environment
provides
the
best
chance
of
solving
any
problem
because
it
maximizes
creativity
however
there
is
never
any
guarantee
that
a
really
good
solution
will
ever
be
found
to
any
particular
problem
utopia
is
not
an
option
utopia
is
a
myth
although
we
can
do
a
lot
better
than
what
we
have
today
but
i
think
that
you
must
pitch
libertarianism
as
a
progressive
agenda
ie
you
can
do
better
under
our
style
of
system
i
admire

you

are
some

i
have

and
when
it

you
need
salesmen
whether
you
want
them

not
what
we
need
are
more
people
who
agree

us
know
something
about
marketin
and
are
willing

both
do
that
marketing

teach

i
found
out
about
some
of
the
politics
that
is
going

the
texas
bullet
train
and
was
appalled
at
some
of
the
apparent
underhanded
tactics
to
push
this
thing
through
without
any
public
say
whatsoever
so
i
wrote
up
a
short
editorial
thing
and
posted
it
hoping
to
get
some
discussion
i
suppose
editorials
dont
do
it
here
so
now
i
am
asking
for
the
general
opinion
of
the
net
about
the
proposed
high
speed
train
what
do
you
think
i
personally
think
it
is
a
stupid
idea
and
that
there
are
a
few
people
somewhere
who
are
going
to
get
very
rich
from
this
deal
my
opinion
is
this
in
a
society
whose
economy
is
primarily
based
on
capitalism
the
role
of
government
should
be
to
provide
those
goods
and
services
that
need
providing
for
the
general
publics
good
but
government
should
supply
those
necessary
goods
and
services
only
when
it
is
impossible
for
a
private
enterprise
or
individual
to
make
money
from
providing
them
i
agree
with
some
of
the
other
posts
that
this
train
probably
can
not
make
money
and
will
rely
heavily
on
state
tax
dollars
the
question
i
think
then
becomes
do
we
the
general
public
need
the
train
i
certainly
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
need
this
train
in
lubbock
texas
with
the
inexpensive
air
travel
provided
between
dallas
and
houston
i
dont
think
people
in
dallas
or
houston
need
it

that

greg

just
as
willing
as
you

that

but
what
i
hear
from
libertarians
is
a
desire

weaken

by
eliminating
its
power
to
enforce
antitrust
laws
and
a
desire
to

each
strikes
me
as
a
particularly
ineffective
way
to
insure
that
auto
dealers
and
other
special
interests
cannot
influence
public
policy
in
fact
they
seem
clearly
designed
to
accomplish
the
opposite
if
government
is
not
allowed
to
use
noninitiated
force
to
achieve
its
goals
than
no
special
interest
can
influence
the
government
to
use
noninitiated
force
on
their
behalf
fine
libertarians
and
anarchists
are
not
alone
in
being
uncomfortable
with
the
use
of
state
sponsored
coercion
the
notion
that
coercion
can
be
virtually
eliminated
in
a
society
or
more
properly
that
once
it
is
eliminated
on
the
part
of
the
state
it
is
no
longer
worth
serious
consideration
is
a
view
that
is
peculiar
to
libertarians
and
anarchists
for
example
does
noninitiated
force
coercion
include
tax
collection
does
it
include
the
minimal
level
of
regulation
of
commerce
envisioned
by
adam
smith
since
coercion
can
be
exercised
by
actors
other
than
the
state
how
is
the
state
to
deal
with
it
exclusively
through
after
the
fact
arbitrationlegal
compulsion
the
means
to
reaching
such
a
restricted
government
is
another
topic
which
ill
address
briefly
it
certainly
wont
happen
until
libertarianism
is
the
dominate
philosophy
what
means
do
we
have
to
make
libertarianism
the
dominate
philosophy
statists
run
the
education
monopoly
so
we
have
to
be
creative
the
advocates
for
selfgovernment
reports
of
their
seminar
participants
embrace
libertarianism
thats
the
best
means
ive
seen
yet
we
should
lobby
for
compulsory
seminar
attendance
in
jest
well
i
must
admit
that
the
picture
of
libertarians
as
amway
participants
is
somewhat
more
reassuring
than
the
idea
of
them
trying
to
govern
a
complex
conflictual
industrial
society
id
venture
to
point
out
however
that
if
libertarians
couldnt
convince
at
least
of
a
group
of
seminar
participants
to
embrace
their
philosophy
their
propaganda
skills
need
to
be
honed
frankly
however
it
is
no
great
trick
to
create
a
government
for
a
society
in
which
almost
everyone
is
assumed
to
agree
about
what
is
a
proper
government
policy
once
that
is
assumed
all
sorts
of
annoying
formalities
can
be
dispensed
with
elections
police
etc
and
as
mr
marx
said
the
state
will
just
wither
away
on
the
way
there
however
would
you
like
to
explain
how
eliminating
virtually
all
policies
that
restrain
private
coercion
in
the
current
society
will
help
us
to
live
happier
lives
or
is
it
like
socialism
just
some
shortterm
pain
that
well
have
to
bear
until
everyone
has
had
the
benefit
of
reeducation

regular

punishing
the
person
for

such
a
thing
smacks
of
authoritarianism
its
a
deliberate
act
of
fraud
intended
to
cause
harm
you
seem
to
be
unclear
about
the
legal
meaning
of
fraud
mere
misrepresentation
is
not
fraud
your
comment
here
is
meant
as
a
put
down
it
fails
for
several
reasons
you
have
edited
out
the
context
of
the
action
under
discussion
i
never
brought
the
legal
definition
up
i
use
the
english
language
and
not
the
legal
dialect
the
legal
definition
of
fraud
changes
from
one
country
to
another
in
any
case
the
context
of
the
discussion
is
morality
of
censorship
how
does
a
posting
from
your
site
do
any
such
thing
especially
if
your
site
is
a
university
do
you
know
any
person
who
believes
that
a
university
endorses
every
comment
made
from
a
university
site
that
is
why
i
refered
specifically
to
a
company
good
now
do
you
know
any
person
who
believes
that
a
company
endorses
every
comment
made
from
a
university
site
you
are
extrapolating
from
the
statement
i
made
concerning
a
circumstance
in
which
such
an
act
of
censorship
would
be
permissable
to
the
teel
case
if
you
had
bothered
to
read
the
post
instead
of
trying
to
prove
how
stupid
you
thought
me
you
would
have
done
rather
better
the
mode
of
argument
i
was
using
was
a
form
of
rhetoric
argument
by
example
i
describe
a
wide
set
of
circumstances
in
which
an
action
is
permisable
and
demonstrate
that
they
do
not
apply
thus
the
action
is
not
permisable
obviously
a
company
posting
from
a
university
adress
would
be
squashed
it
would
be
contrary

the

if

you
get
a
better
stationery
designer
now
you
are
clutching
at
straws
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
it
was
the
fact
of
association
between
the
company
and
the
post
that
was
important
the
typeface
etc
is
inconsequential
there
are
people
on
the
net
who
are
openly
supporting
the
murder
of
members
of

sigh
if
you
are

i

you
read

if
you
are
suggesting
that
advocating
murder
is
a
trivial
matter
i
would
prefer
that
you
state
it
directly
certainly
i
oppose
the
right
of
dr
sidiqui
and
the
ayatolah
khomenhi
to
call
for
the
murder
of
salman
rushdie
incitement
to
murder
is
not
part
of
what
i
consider
legitimate
freedom
of
speech
as
for
your
notion
that
employees
can
argue
their
different
political
views
at
their
own
expense
could
you
explain
precisely
what
expense
youre
talking
about
internet
is
not
free
the
connection
charges
are
quite
expensive
for
comercial
concerns
could
you
give
me
a
cost
breakdown
for
the
expense
to
your
company
attributable
to
an
employees
posting
a
political
view
in
disagreement
with
yours
numbers
please
that
is
irrelevant
the
case
is
not
the
incremental
cost
but
the
facility
cost
if
i
decide
that
a
company
i
am
associated
with
should
subscribe
to
usenet
that
usenet
connection
is
the
property
of
the
company
it
is
quite
legitimate
for
a
company
to
have
a
political
or
other
agenda
and
regulate
the
use
of
its
property
in
accordance
with
its
policy
for
example
if
a
microsoft
employee
were
to
post
windows
nt
is
crap
dont
buy
it
from
a
microsoft
machine
i
would
consider
it
reasonable
for
microsoft
to
sack
that
employee
in
the
same
way
if
a
company
decides
that
it
has
political
objectives
it
might
wish
to
regulate
postings
in
a
political
manner
this
is
no
worse
than
rupert
murdoch
using
his
papers
as
a
political
platform
for
his
views
i
was
refering
to
the
arrogance
of
your
position
quoting
the
words
written
by
slave
owners
at
me
in
the
cause
of
freedom
which
words
written
by
slave
owners
did
i
quote
i
dont
recall
quoting
anyone
ah
yes
you
did
not
quote
them
merely
refered
to
them
your
constitution
is
not
considered
sacrosanct
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
nor
have
i
assumed
it
is
i
dont
consider
the
first
amendment
to
have
talismanic
value
you
might
just
as
well
have
attempted
to
argue
from
the
king
james
bible
to
a
muslim
i
was
pointing
out
that
your
reasoning
is
parochial
when
with
little
effort
you
could
have
made
a
substantive
point
i
made
the
effort
apparently
you
made
a
certain
effort
to
misunderstand
me
your
article
consisted
of
a
reference
to
the
first
ammendment
your
signature
and
pretty
well
damn
all
else
for
an
example
of
a
uk
publication
that
understands
this
try
index
on
censorship
i
used
to
subscribe
i
would
still
if
i
was
not
moving
index
regularly
publishes
opinions
by
nonamericans
who
believe
the
first
amendment
represents
appropriate
freespeech
principles
for
all
open
societies
see
eg
the
opinions
of
the
dissenting
law
lords
in
the
spycatcher
case
are
you
refering
to
the
initial
hearings
on
an
injunction
or
the
judgments
on
the
substantive
case
the
initial
hearings
that
the
government
won
were
judged
on
the
not
unresonable
judgment
that
assertion
by
the
government
that
the
national
interest
might
be
harmed
would
be
grounds
for
prior
restraint
the
second
set
of
hearings
on
the
substance
judged
that
the
government
had
no
case
and
that
the
official
secrets
act
could
not
be
used
to
suppress
information
in
thwe
public
domain
already
the
part
that
they
won
was
over
the
copyright
issue
which
is
rather
separate
here
again
the
issue
of
censorship
is
rather
different
in
the
case
that
information
is
divulged
on
the
understanding
that
it
will
not
be
communicated
to
third
parties
the
first
ammendment
certainly
does
not
apply
in
this
case
as
the
numerous
prosecutions
of
spies
in
the
us
proves
the
crux
of
the
spycatcher
affair
was
extrateritoriality
of
british
law
the
censorship
aspect
of
it
arose
as
a
result
of
the
governments
ludicrous
attempts
to
prevent
summary
of
the
case
in
the
book
you
havent
any
reason
to
believe
that
anything
ive
said
has
been
reached
unquestioningly
only
most
of
what
you
write
for
someone
who
purports
to
be
opposed
to
argument
from
assertion
you
certainly
get
by
on
assertions
a
lot
funny
i
saw
that
as
a
rejection
of
an
assertion
that
you
had
made
of
course
in
rejecting
an
assertion
i
have
to
make
a
contrary
assertion
since
this
assertion
is
unprovable
i
left
it
at
that
so
far
i
have
not
seen
you
demonstrate
a
command
of
the
contrary
opinion
to
your
own
you
are
attacking
my
anticensorship
view
because
i
dare
to
accept
the
validity
of
some
procensorship
arguments
while
rejecting
their
conclusions
plus
i
am
not
an
absolutist
i
have
this
funny
idea
that
the
solution
to
this
problem
was
not
decided
in
by
a
group
of
white
male
gentry
in
secret
session
and
sumarized
in
a
single
line
furthermore
i
dont
think
that
the
issues
are
half
as
simple
as
you
imply
you
may
think
that
i
am
being
antiamerican
in
disallowing
recourse
to
the
first
ammendment
its
just
that
this
argument
has
no
currency
in
the
parts
of
the
world
where
there
is
state
censorship
such
as
iran
kewait
and
israel
i
dont
pretend
to
have
geared
my
discourse
for
all
conceivable
audiences
i
dont
think
that
you
have
geered
your
discourse

the

an

exceeding
the

unfortunately

it

very

they

lurch

there
is
remarkably
little
being

that
it

health

this
has
been

only
the

catch

the
problem
for

is
what
to
do
now
it
has
succeeded
nobody
ever
claimed
that
the
collapse
of

the

in
recent
editorials
iran
was
universally
recognized
as
te
source
of
the
double
threat
of
statesponsored
terrorism
and
islamic
extremism
but
beyond
this
fear
and
condemnation
journalists
found
little
common
ground
that
would
compel
both
north
and
south
and
arab
and
nonarab
nations
to
work
together
to
combat
the
global
threat
of
terrorism
for
example
egyptian
and
algerian
papers
were
in
the
forefront
in
charging
us
complicity
in
the
current
instability
in
the
middle
east
those
commentators
asserted
that
the
united
states
had
promoted
islamic
fundamentalism
during
the
afghanistan
war
and
had
further
added
to
regional
instability
by
alternately
encouraging
iraq
and
iran
the
cads
the
fact
that
this
is
precisely
what
the
us
was
up
to
of
course
is
not
mentioned
it
is
a
fact
that
regan
and
bush
sold
arms
to
iran
it
is
also
a
fact
that
they
supported
and
armed
iraq
still
this
is
state
dept
propaganda
so
none
too
surprizing
indias
papers
weighed
the
pros
and
cons
of
helping
the
west
to
identify
pakistans
role
in
promoting
terrorism
noting
on
the
one
hand
that
doing
so
could
bring
ruination
to
islamabads
kashmir
cause
but
on
the
other
could
also
bring
indias
security
apparatus
uncomfortably
close
to
the
cia
and
the
mossad
arab
papers
continued
to
portray
iraq
and
libya
as
being
unfairly
treated
by
the
un
while
israel
remains
unpunished
for
resolutions
which
it
has
violated
in
the
case
of
lybia
there
is
the
problem
that
the
us
only
decided
that
gadffii
ordered
the
bombing
after
it
needed
to
make
peace
with
damascus
during
the
gulf
war
one
day
the
us
is
certain
that
its
syria
the
next
lybia
for
a
strange
reason
the
us
will
not
provide
evidence
to
lybian
courts
for
extradition
proceedings
faced
with
similar
demands
the
usa
would
reject
them
as
would
any
other
country
concerning
northern
ireland
president
clintons
message
of
consolation
to
the
victims
of
the
warrington
bombing
was
seen
in
british
tabloids
as
signalling
a
tougher
stance
by
the
american
government
against
violence
by
the
ira
the
word
is
terrorism
the
problem
is
that
after
the
behaviour
of
george
bush
the
usa
has
an
image
abroad
as
doing
precisely
what
it
likes
and
is
in
its
own
interests
then
comming
out
with
a
dysney
scripted
sugary
justification
repeating
a
fitting
combination
of
the
words
freedom
dignity
democaracy
or
of
terrorism
dictatorship
etc
as
appropriate
the
usa
could
go
quite
far
to
mend
the
bridges
with
iran
the
people
there
are
rather
pissed
off
because
the
usa
first
supported
the
shah
who
they
loathed
and
then
supported
saddam
when
he
mounted
an
unprovoked
attack
hardly
surprizing
after
the
embassy
hostage
crisis
but
iran
is
meant
to
be
the
country
run
by
unreasonable
bigots
not
the
usa
so
if
there
is
to
be
movement
it
would
be
easier
for
the
usa
to
move
first
off
they
could
recognise
iraqus
responsibility
in
initiating
the
iraniraq
war
providing
technical
assistance
to
iran
to
get
its
oil
production
back
up
to
capacity
would
also
be
a
smart
move
at
the
moment
iran
is
above
its
opec
ceiling
if
they
had
extra
capacity
they
would
use
it
and
bring
down
the
oild
price
further
which
is
in
our
interests
the
iranian
clerics
would
have
an
interest
in
seeking
a
raprochment
simply
because
a
permanent
war
footing
is
debilitating
they

at

proof
it

for

yes

the
federalist
papers
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
determine
precisely
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
they
certainly
emphasised
a
limited
role
for
the
federal
government
but
this
was
not
necessarily
their
true
position
and
like
the
house
of
lords
which
it
is
copied
from
it
was
given
pretty
wide
powers
unfortunately
they
started
to
use
them
and
thus
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
aware
the
house
of
lords
had
wide
powers
i
was
under
the
impression
is
was
pretty
powerless
compared
to
the
house
of
commons
and
certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce
bills
relating
to
raising
revenue
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of

in
the
period

the
stripping

of
the

did
not
occur
until

budget
even
despite
this
the
house
of

has
considerable
power
even
today
and
is
far
from
a
rubber
stamping
body
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
other
writings
gives
me
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
make
use
of
their
lawmaking
powers
in
fact
gridlock
appears
to
have
been
designed
into
the
system
with
the
senate
being
a
more
deliberative
body
to
act
as
a
check

the
moreoften

the

is

that
it
ended

slow
on
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that
the

was
supposed

be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the
house
youll
note
that
while
the
presidents
veto
may
be
overridden
the
house
cant
do
anything
about
a
veto
by
the
senate
the
president
veto
was
meant
to
be
entirely
separate
until
bush
abused
it
in
a
quite
extraordinary
manner
it
was
used
more
in
accord
with
the
intent
of
being
a
check
on
unreasonable
legislation
the
veto
was
clearly
regarded
as
a
completely
last
gasp
measure
its
use
was
meant
to
be
restricted
to
preventing
the
legislature
interfering
with
the
actions
of
the

the

plebicite

suppressed
for
years
and
its
restoration
eight
years
later
would
mark
the
start
of
the
french
revolution
after
the
uk
system
the
major
influences
were
the
dutch
system
and
of
course
the
classical
systems
nobody
seriously
suggests
that
rome
or
greece
were
models
though
because
the
political
systems
of
both
countries
were
acknowleged
disasters
the
main
lesson
learnt
from
greece
was
that
unless
a
federal
state
was
constructed
a
war
would
be
inevitable
the
greek
democracies
were
always
fighting
amongst
themselves
which
is
how
rome
managed
to
invade
had
the
federal
consitution
been
rejected
the
new
roman
empire
in

of

quite
certainly
have

come
to

under
the
original

there
wasnt
meant
to
be
anything
much
for
the
federal

to
do
except
keep
the
british
out
thats
also
untrue
but
at
least
were
wandering
a
little
closer
toward
reality
that
the
articles
of
confederation
fell
apart
is
enough
proof
it
was
there
for
just
a
tad
bit
more
well
yes
and
no
the
federalist
papers
are
propaganda
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
to
determine
precisely
what
maddison
etc
were
up
to
from
them
there
are
a
couple
of
ways
to
look
at
them
one
is
we
want
you
to
support
this
constitution
so
well
say
anything
that
we
think
will
appeal
to
you
or
the
more
straightforward
this
is
why
we
think
what
weve
suggested
in
this
constitution
is
a
good
idea
you
clearly
consider
the
former
to
be
the
primary
situation
they
certainly
emphasised
a
limited
role
for
the
federal
government
but
this
was
not
necessarily
their
true
position
well
i
know
hamilton
was
a
dyed
in
the
wool
monarchist
and
probably
the
authoritarian
extreme
to
jeffersons
democratic
impules
but
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
means
of
determining
their
opinions
on
the
government
if
we
dont
consider
what
they
wrote
about
the
government
and
is
writing
in
support
of
something
automatically
propoganda
to
the
point
we
must
assume
it
is
untrue
or
that
they
are
saying
what
they
dont
believe
and
like
the
house
of
lords
which
it
is
copied
from
it
was
given
pretty
wide
powers
unfortunately
they
started
to
use
them
and
thus
the
gridlock
set
in
i
wasnt
aware
the
house
of
lords
had
wide
powers
i
was
under
the
impression
is
was
pretty
powerless
compared
to
the
house
of
commons
and
certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce
bills
relating
to
raising
revenue
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
in
the
period
in
question
if
the
senate
was
less
powerful
than
the
house
of
lords
than
wed
almost
have
to
state
that
the
house
of
representatives
was
also
in
fact
they
both
were
because
the
british
government
had
much
greater
power
than
did
the
american
system
my
reading
of
the
constitution
and
other
writings
gives
me
absolutely
no
reason
to
believe
the
senate
wasnt
intended
to
make
use
of
their
lawmaking
powers
in
fact
gridlock
appears
to
have
been
designed
into
the
system
with
the
senate
being
a
more
deliberative
body
to
act
as
a
check
on
the
moreoften
elected
house
the
system
is
meant
to
be
slow
to
react
the
problem
is
that
it
ended
up
a
bit
too
slow
i
disagree
the
system
is
not
too
slow
it
was
simply
designed
to
handle
less
than
it
has
demanded
that
it
handle
as
somebody
in
washington
put
it
whose
name
i
forget
congress
has
become
everybodys
city
council
congress
is
more
than
capable
of
quick
action
and
has
more
than
enough
power
and
time
on
its
hands
if
it
confined
itself
to
what
its
original
jurisidiction
was
and
allowed
more
local
autonomy
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
system
of
government
they
created
failing
but
that
it
is
operating
under
a
set
of
conditions
they
specifically
wanted
to
avoid
namely
a
concentration
of
power
it
would
seem
then
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
not
to
reduce
the
power
of
either
house
in
some
attempt
to
grease
the
wheels
all
youll
get
then
is
a
system
which
moves
quicker
to
do
stupid
things
it
would
make
more
sense
to
make
more
decisions
at
a
local
level
on
what
basis
do
you
suggest
that
the
senate
was
supposed
to
be
some
sort
of
rubberstamp
for
the
house
youll
note
that
while
the
presidents
veto
may
be
overridden
the
house
cant
do
anything
about
a
veto
by
the
senate
the
president
veto
was
meant
to
be
entirely
separate
until
bush
abused
it
in
a
quite
extraordinary
manner
it
was
used
more
in
accord
with
the
intent
of
being
a
check
on
unreasonable
legislation
please
explain
to
me
how
bush
abused
the
veto
in
an
extraordinary
manner
the
veto
was
clearly
regarded
as
a
completely
last
gasp
measure
its
use
was
meant
to
be
restricted
to
preventing
the
legislature
interfering
with
the
actions
of
the
executive
i
fail
to
see
where
any
restrictions
implied
or
otherwise
were
placed
on
the
veto
it
could
just
as
easily
have
been
read
as
a
means
to
put
a
check
on
democratically
popular
but
unwise
in
the
executives
opinion
policies
there
is
no
limit
in
the
constitution
to
the
presidents
veto
power
regarding
what
a
bill
is
for
previous
presidents
have
used
the
veto
for
any
number
of
reasons
most
usually
having
something
to
do
with
their
agenda
i
am
really
curious
how
you
single
bush
out
as
the
president
who
abused
vetos
the
senate
is
not
meant
to
be
exactly
a
rubber
stamp
body
it
is
meant
as
a
check
on
unrestrained
legislation
that
is
the
extra
measure
built
into
the
constitution
in
favour
of
the
status
quo
of
the
representatives
of
the
states
is
not
a
reasonable
restriction
why
is
it
not
a
reasonable
restriction
because
senators
is
the
magic
holy
number
upon
which
laws
must
be
based
if
senators
feel
safe
enough
with
their
state
constituencies
to
stand
up
and
fillibuster
isnt
that
enough
to
indicate
theres
a
sufficient
question
as
to
whether
a
law
is
a
good
idea
or
not
to
reevaluate
it
why
one
earth
should
be
sufficient
to
enact
a
law
which
covers
million
people
in
very
very
diverse
places
and
living
in
radically
different
conditions
why
shouldnt
a
supermajority
be
required
any
system
in
which
the
simple
majority
is
given
absolute
power
to
ignore
the
minority
then
the
minority
will
be
ignored
i
do
not
see
this
as
a
positive
thing
and
for
all
that
im
sure
the
republicans
are
looking
for
pork
as
much
as
the
democrats
theyve
got
some
legitimate
objections

the

the
main
difference
between
adolf

and
rush

is
that
hitler
was
original
and
showed
initiative
mort
sahl
on
the
tom

radio
show
abc
radio
network
october
although
i
find
myself
often
disagreeing
with
the
populist
rationale
of
mr
limbaugh
i
find
him
entertaining
and
i
often
agree
with
his
conclusions
the
fact
that
he
sends
liberal
reactionaries
like
these
idiots
through
the
roof
makes
him
all
the
more
entertaining
nlnsbelieve
it
or
not
i
was
planning
this
comparative
review
of
mein
kampf
and
limbaughs
transcribed
rant
the
way
things
ought
to
be
before
sahl
issued
his
comparative
review
as
usual
sahls
was
independent
and
sharp
as
a
scalpel
my
effort
can
only
dream
of
comparing
favorably
to
morts
at
least
it
has
a
fairly
popular
orginating
premise
everyone
id
mention
the
idea
to
thought
it
was
either
divinely
inspired
or
at
least
past
due
for
delivery
those
reactions
are
based
on
parallels
that
should
be
obvious
to
the
most
peripheral
observer
of
the
acts
of
those
false
prophets
both
are
noted
for
their
galvanizing
oratorical
skills
which
they
both
used
with
passion
to
generate
a
political
cult
of
massive
numerical
proportions
in
fact
limbaugh
claims
to
have
an
audience
of
just
over
million
almost
identical
to
the
number
of
votes
cast
for
hitler
in
the
april
german
election
both
used
a
myopic
social
perspective
to
build
the
cult
and
enthusiastically
amputated
facts
from
the
record
to
fabricate
their
ideological
quilt
actually
i
find
limbaughs
oratory
less
than
sizzling
and
his
debating
skills
sometimes
lacking
even
though
his
conclusions
are
often
correct
i
would
suggest
that
a
bankrupt
leftist
ideology
that
hopes
to
use
concentrated
political
power
and
a
loaded
gun
to
force
everyone
to
do
the
right
things
where
right
is
defined
by
the
elitist
academics
who
lead
the
movement
is
showing
an
acute
case
of
myopic
social
perspective
not
to
mention
arrogance
and
utter
stupidity
limbaugh
is
certainly
far
from
perfect
but
his
opponents
in
the
established
body
politic
and
the
media
are
the
ones
arguing
for
federal
control
of
virtually
all
aspects
of
the
lives
of
the
citizenry
and
for
the
elimination
of
local
control
over
affairs
public
perhaps
limbaugh
has
a
following
because
the
people
are
tired
of
being
treated
like
errant
children
by
a
selfimportant
group
of
arrogant
controlling
myopic
people
who
have
no
understanding
of
how
life
operates
outside
of
the
oughtabes
inside
their
own
hopelessly
closed
minds
the
last
point
is
glaringly
documented
by
passages
in
the
opening
pages
of
both
books
hitlers
example
is
when
on
page
he
claims
the
german
nationalist
terrorist
leo
schlageter
he
bombed
part
of
a
railway
line
between
dusseldorf
and
duisburg
being
caught
in
the
act
in
was
betrayed
to
france
by
a
representative
of
his
government
when
there
has
never
been
any
factual
foundation
for
such
a
statement
in
fact
the
governments
of
both
the
reich
and
prussia
as
well
as
the
vatican
actively
intervened
to
save
him
from
execution
and
almost
succeeded
ok
let
us
take
your
word
for
that
and
work
with
it
a
nice
specific
incident
limbaugh
follows
suit
by
making
the
hysterically
sarcastic
claim
in
his
introduction
that
in
a
school
or
during
a
commencement
ceremony
or
many
other
public
places
god
is
unconstitutional
of
course
its
not
god
but
the
official
imposition
of
particular
concepts
of
god
against
an
individuals
will
thats
unconstitutional
but
limbaugh
is
too
gleeful
in
his
talent
for
distortion
to
want
you
to
know
that
hmmm
congress
shall
pass
no
law
regarding
an
establishment
of
religion
nor
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
liberal
translation
the
federal
government
as
long
as
it
is
run
by
liberals
may
force
local
school
districts
to
include
certain
iconic
content
in
christmas
displays
while
prohibiting
others
i
think
limbaugh
has
you
on
this
one
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
arguing
for
less
imposition
of
the
federal
government
into
religion
nice
job

the
specificity
of
that
one
too
analysis
of

deleted
but
as
mort
sahl
also
observed
on

the
other
night
some
cloutmeister
of
the
radical
right
wants
limbaugh
to
be
a
focal
point
of
their
propoganda
and
remember
sahl
is
an
al

these

mort
might
not

former

he
knows

evil
lurks
in

major

men
he
knows
that
limbaugh
could
not
have
collected
his
audience
had
not
the
opportunity
been
placed
on
a
silver
platter
and
handed
to
him
limbaugh
earns
his
money
just
as
honestly
as
al
capone
did
its
almost
worthy
of
a
rico
indictment
ah
yes
it
is
a
conspiracy
of
profound
proportions
methinks
that
you
may
be
a
bit
resentful
of
mr
limbaughs
success
because
you
attribute
it
primarily
to
luck
how
after
all
could
anyone
with
profound
differences
of
opinion
from
yourself
have
become
successful
without
the
operation
of
conspiracy
or
blind
luck
do
you
feel
this
same
level
of
kneejerk
resentment
against
lottery
winners
or
do
you
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
on
questions
of
social
issues
there
is
an
overabundance
of
material
in
the
limbaugh
book
that
seems
to
echo
hitlers
venom
for
example
this
should
be
great
fun
since
it
is
the
liberal
movement
in
america
that
is
pushing
the
hardest
for
centralized
fascist
control
of
the
people
and
business
governmentbusiness
partnership
indeed
and
mr
limbaugh
is
the
populist
nemesis
of
that
movement
i
have
read
mr
limbaughs
book
and
although
it
was
not
the
most
literary
piece
i
have
read
in
recent
memory
it
certainly
did
not
contain
venom
at
all
let
alone
venom
comparable
to
an
individual
who
callously
murdered
millions
out
of

that
oratory
limbaugh
who
needs
the
media
when
theyve
got
me
the
show
is
devoted
exclusively
to
what
i
think
the
phrase
with
half
my
brain
tied
behind
my
back
to
make
it
even
denotes
the
egress
of
mental
aptitude
i
require
to
engage
and
demolish
liberals
and
others
who
disagree
with
me
it
might
take
four
or
five
years
but
im
convinced
the
media
will
slowly
and
reluctantly
come
around
to
my
way
of
thinking
kicking
and
screaming
all
the
way
pages
and
respectively
you
neglect
to
mention
that
mr
limbaugh
have
you
ever
listened
to
his
show
btw
continuously
encourages
his
audience
to
think
for
themselves
rather
than
blindly
following
any
media
icon
himself
included
you
yourself
mention
that
he
makes
no
bones
about
his
show
being
strictly
about
his
own
opinions
he
also
adopts
a
rather
satirical
approach
and
presumes
his
audience
to
be
intelligent
enough
to
distinguish
satire
from
seriousness
and
he
says
as
much
this
is
in
contrast
to
the
average
massmedia
show
in
which
the
audience
is
treated
as
societys
intellectual
lowest
common
denominator
i
am
sure
that
adolf
hitler
was
a
master
of
satire
i
am
sure
he
was
just
kidding
when
he
said
that
the
jews
were
the
cause
of
germanys
problems
and
needed
to
be
exterminated
on
religion
as
the
basis
of
a
nation
hitler
in
this
world
human
culture
and
civilization
are
inseperably
bound
up
with
the
existence
of
the
aryan
his
dyingoff
or
his
decline
would
again
lower
upon
this
earth
the
dark
veils
of
a
time
without
culture
he
who
dares
to
lay
hand
upon
the
highest
image
of
the
lord
sins
against
the
benevolent
creator
of
this
miracle
and
helps
in
the
expulsion
from
paradise
page
this
is
not
religion
it
is
clearly
a
perverse
worship
of
race
since
christ
was
a
jew
it
seems
quite
unlikely
that
hitlers
characterization
of
the
aryan
as
the
highest
image
of
the
lord
fits
with
christian
doctrine
limbaugh
america
was
founded
as
a
judeochristian
country
but
our
intellectual
and
political
elites
are
often
either
hostile
or
ambivalent
toward
religion
people
for
whom
belief
in
god
is
at
best
a
charming
superstition
have
managed
to
ban
prayer
from
the
public
schools
for
the
last
thirty
years
is
it
only
a
coincidence
that
the
quality
of
american
education
has
declined
ever
since
pages
private
religious
schools
have
a
vastly
better
record
of
success
than
publicly
funded
schools
american
history
is
indeed
primarily
judeo
christian
i
suppose
that
mr
limbaugh
pointing
out
facts
is
equivalent
to
adolf
hitler
worshiping
the
aryan
race
i
think
you
might
be
reaching
just
a
wee
bit
here
on
popular
culture
as
a
reason
for
social
collapse
hitler
the
fight
against
the
poisoning
of
the
soul
has
to
set
in
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
menus
of
our
movie
houses
vaudevilles
and
theatres
and
one
can
hardly
deny
that
this
is
not
the
right
kind
of
food
theatre
art
literature
movies
the
press
billposters
and
window
displays
must
be
cleaned
of
the
symptoms
of
a
rotting
world
and
put
into
the
service
of
a
moral
idea
of
state
and
culture
pages
and
definite
suggestion
that
the
government
should
control
the
entertainment
industry
here
limbaugh
today
hollywood
is
in
trouble
the
reason
is
that
hollywood
has
forgotten
who
its
audience
is
they
make
fun
of
people
who
believe
in
god
they
ridicule
the
traditional
family
heterosexuality
and
monagamy
they
disparage
american
heroes
page
just
a
guess
here
but
i
dont
think
that
mr
limbaugh
would
advocate
government
control
of
hollywood
you
should
perhaps
call
his
radio
show
to
confirm
this
i
believe
this
is
more
a
criticism
of
hollywood
and
the
depraved
moral
values
it
espouses
not
an
advocation
of
government
control
of
hollywood
liberals
on
the
other
hand
want
to
have
complete
government
control
of
our
school
systems
so
that
the
government
can
teach
the
people
at
an
early
age
the
right
way
to
view
religion
and
morality
i
believe
mr
limbaugh
is
against
this
as
his
satirical
use
of
the
young
heads
full
of
mush
hyperbole
indicates
on
the
news
meida
hitler
the
activity
of
the
socalled
liberal
press
was
the
work
of
gravediggers
for
the
german
people
and
the
german
reich
one
can
pass
by
in
silence
the
marxist
papers
of
lies
its
task
is
only
to
break
the
peoples
folkish
and
national
spine
in
order
to
make
it
ripe
for
the
yoke
of
slavery
of
international
capital
and
its
masters
the

page
pretty
strong
conspiracy
theory
insinuated
here
with
an
implicit
plea
for
government
power
to
be
used
to
break
up
the
conspiracy
limbaugh
elements
of
the
media
have
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
of
leftist
causes
the
cynical
journalist
of
the
past
has
been
replaced
in
many
cases
by
an
enthusiastic
cheerleader
for
causes
during
the
gulf
war
cnn
correspondent
bernard
shaw
said
cnn
is
a
global
network
we
cant
take
sides
cant
take
sides
if
they
dont
realize
that
their
freedom
lies
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
that
therefore
they
should
defend
this
nation
they
are
hopelessly
misguided
and
may
i
suggest
flirting
with
megalomania
pages
and
indication
here
that
elements
of
the
media
since
career
is
a
selfselected
categorization
perhaps
an
inferred
larger
percentage
than
represented
in
the
populace
at
large
has
a
leftist
bias
doesnt
sound
too
unreasonable
no
insinuation
that
cnn
should
not
report
in
an
objective
fashion
only
that
for
reporters
to
say
that
they
do
not
have
any
personal
bias
in
the
situation
is
disingenuous
to
megalomaniacal
you
may
disagree
and
it
may
well
be
exagerrated
but
it
is
not
an
unreasonable
opinion
and
mr
limbaugh
goes
well
out
of
his
way
to
make
sure
that
his
audience
knows
that
these
are
his
opinions
unlike
most
other
reporting
that
purports
to
achieve
perfect
objectivity
but
in
actuality
will
in
some
degree
or
other
in
a
statistical
sense
reflect
the
biases
of
the
reporters
who
is
being
disingenuous
here
mr
shaw
or
mr
limbaugh
again
you
should
ask
mr
limbaugh
himself
but
i
expect
that
he
would
oppose
government
control
of
the
media
to
continue
these
comparative
excerpts
is
certainly
possible
but
ultimately
too
depressing
to
take
in
one
reading
it
is
indeed
depressing
to
see
such
myopia
and
tiresome
liberal
arrogance
liberals
love
to
play
games
with
paradigms
as
a
way
of
discrediting
people
who
disagree
with
them
why
dont
you
challenge
conservative
ideology
on
an
intellectual
level
rather
than
engaging
in
ludicrous
comparisons
perhaps
the
underpinnings
of
your
ideology
are
intellectual
only
in
that
they
exist
in
your
mind
not
the
real
world
after
putting
these
books
down
there
is
one
undeniable
fact
that
haunts
me
in
the
adolf
hitler
fed
depressed
and
frightened
germans
the
opiate
of
hatred
of
those
around
them
in
turn
it
allowed
germans
to
hand
their
collective
national
power
to
the
nazis
in
the
rush
limbaugh
is
doing
the
very
same
thing
distributing
hatred
to
depressed
and
frightened
americans
in
turn
it
is
helping
the
american
radical
right
to
maintain
its
power
base
as
the
nightmare
of
the
reaganbush
era
comes
to
an
end
hoping
to
rebuild
it
into
their
hopes
for
the
fascist
states
of
america
perhaps
there
are
a
few
among
the
intellectually
challenged
who
percieve
rush
limbaugh
as
a
hatemonger
but
in
my
experience
he
has
been
spreading
laughter
at
the
ludicrous
selfimportance
of
the
left
not
hatred
as
to
mr
bush
you
may
be
correct
about
his
fascist
economic
leanings
mr
reagan
on
the
other
hand
did
his
best
to
reverse
the
fascist
trend
of
government
involvement
in
business
mr
clinton
is
increasing
fascism
in
america
through
businessgovernment
partnership
and
increased
levels
of
taxation
perhaps
you
should
not
have
skipped
your
vocabulary
classes
in
grade
school
and
if
limbaugh
is
not
as
repellant
a
hitler
it
is
only
because
the
radical
right
utilizes
limbaugh
as
its
own
gateway
opiate
one
can
only
wonder
what
the
ultimate
drug
is
they
plan
to
hook
america
on
hmmm
seems
to
me
that
limbaugh
is
not
in
any
way
comparable
to
hitler
because
he
has
not
murdered
six
million
jews
and
many
many
others
out
of
racism
i
come
from
a
mixedrace
family
so
i
am
quite
well
attuned
to
racism
i
dont
hear
any
coming
from
rush
limbaugh
the
only
place
i
hear
racism
coming
from
these
days
and
being
taken
seriously
is
from
the
liberal
left
the
liberal
left
is
the
movement
i
see
trying
to
get
america
hooked
on
the
opiates
of
socialized
medicine
socialized
transportation
socialized
education
etc
the
left
already
has
america
hopelessly
addicted
to
that
liberal
drug
the
social
security
chain
letter
it
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
while
the
hitler
analogy
does
not
really
apply
to
either
rush
limbaugh
or
william
jefferson
clinton
if
one
of
the
two
is

one

as
i
did
in

the

the
fact

is
in

unsophisticated

in

sell

in

anyone
missed
it
there
was
no
shortage
of
similar
advice
late
last

in

nytimes
eg
even
though
that
advice
was
based
not
on
the
foregone
conclusion
of
enacted
law
as
in

merely
on
the
assumption
that
clinton
would
raise
tax
rates
without
capping
cg
taxes
contrary
to
the

its
nice
to
think
that

is
was
pretty
powerless
compared

certainly
didnt
have
almost
equal
their
powers
the
senate
is
restricted
only
that
it
may
not
introduce

relating

the

was
less

the
stripping

all

most
of

arent
and
the

we
have
had
individually
far

ones
how
typical
so
you
think
we
shouldnt
avoid
these
events
i
shall
refrain
from
the

disaster
since
it

to
upset
you
so
much
when
we

you

you

you

hmm
i
suppose
you
could
be
right
they
are
as
natural
as
a

or
a

not
so
look
if
you

or

or
whatever
fine
do
so

dont

to

they

why
its
a
closed
meeting
q
what
about
the
lunch
ms
myers
the
lunch
no
theres
no
coverage
q
is
he
meeting
with
any
congress
people
today
ms
myers
nothing
scheduled
q
there
are
no
meetings
ms
myers
there
are
no
congressional
meetings
today
no
q
has
the
president
been
given
any
information
by
the
pentagon
or
reached
any
conclusion
about
the
validity
of
this
report
from
hanoi
any
instructions
to
vessey
on
how
to
deal
with
the
vietnamese
on
that
subject
ms
myers
well
clearly
the
report
is
the
first
order
of
business
its
high
on
the
agenda
on
something
that
theyll
discuss
i
think
the
president
and
general
vessey
will
discuss
the
parameters
of
his
visit
to
vietnam
today
but
the
president
hasnt
drawn
any
conclusions
about
the
report
yet
certainly
its
something
that
he
wants
general
vessey
to
talk
with
the
vietnamese
about
first
q
did
the
president
talk
with
any
republican
senators
yesterday
about
the
stimulus
package
ms
myers
he
spoke
with
senator
dole
q
how
many
times
ms
myers
i
believe
once
during
the
day
and
once
last
night
q
what
was
the
outcome
of
that
ms
myers
theyre
continuing
to
work
toward
some
kind
of
an
agreement
on
a
jobs
package
q
is
it
your
impression
that
senator
dole
is
in
any
way
flexible
on
this
ms
myers
well
i
think
were
hopeful
that
were
going
to
get
some
kind
of
jobs
package
through
the
senate
and
well
continue
to
work
with
senator
dole
and
others
until
we
reach
some
kind
of
an
agreement
q
did
they
discuss
the
vat
tax
ms
myers
i
dont
know
if
that
came
up
q
can
you
check
that
ms
myers
sure
q
so
what
are
they
is
the
president
offering
to
scale
down
his
program
is
that
what
hes
trying
to
do
buy
it
down
to
where
dole
will
sign
on
ms
myers
well
hes
trying
to
protect
as
much
of
it
as
he
can
but
its
important
to
him
to
get
some
kind
of
a
jobs
package
through
the
senate
and
through
congress
now
and
as
soon
as
we
reach
some
conclusions
on
that
well
let
you
know
but
at
the
moment
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
members
of
congress
including
obviously
senator
dole
q
is
he
talking
to
anybody
else
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
he
talked
to
any
other
republicans
yesterday
q
is
he
talking
to
anybody
today
ms
myers
i
dont
think
anything
is
scheduled
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
we
were
led
to
believe
that
the
president
called
mr
dole
on
the
subject
of
russian
aid
and
that
bob
dole
brought
the
conversation
around
to
stimulus
package
is
that
correct
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
has
contacted
several
people
on
russian
aid
i
think
that
it
was
always
expected
that
the
stimulus
package
or
the
jobs
package
will
be
part
of
any
conversation
he
would
have
with
senator
dole
the
primary
objective
of
the
conversation
was
russian
aid
that
was
the
first
order
of
business
but
it
was
both
q
in
the
presidents
mind
are
they
linked
politically
in
that
if
the
republicans
continue
to
reject
the
stimulus
package
he
thinks
it
will
be
harder
to
sell
russian
aid
to
the
american
people
has
he
made
that
argument
ms
myers
i
cant
talk
about
specifically
what
arguments
he
might
have
made
the
president
is
obviously
committed
to
both
he
liked
to
see
a
jobs
package
to
the
american
people
first
but
as
you
know
we
outlined
the
details
of
additional
russian
aid
last
night
in
tokyo
q
but
does
the
president
believe
that
the
stimulus
package
will
make
it
more
difficult
to
persuade
americans
to
vote
for
russian
to
accept
a
vote
for
russian
aid
ms
myers
i
think
that
the
president
is
going
to
continue
to
work
to
pass
the
stimulus
package
to
pass
a
jobs
package
and
were
still
hopeful
that
well
get
some
kind
of
jobs
package
through
the
congress
q
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
president
is
negotiating
now
with
dole
ms
myers
hes
discussing
options
with
him
q
on
the
stimulus
is
it
your
understanding
that
over
the
break
some
democrats
themselves
have
left
the
support
that
they
had
earlier
for
the
package
the
stimulus
package
ms
myers
i
think
we
still
have
wide
support
in
the
senate
for
the
jobs
package
q
but
specifically
that
youve
lost
democrats
other
than
shelby
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
q
what
about
kohl
q
kohl
and
feingold
ms
myers
there
hasnt
been
a
vote
yet
and
well
continue
to
work
with
senators
to
try
to
get
a
majority
to
try
to
bring
the
package
to
a
vote
because
we
believe
that
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
united
states
senate
support
the
package
q
if
youre
werent
worried
about
kohl
and
feingold
why
did
george
mention
milwaukee
projects
the
other
day
ms
myers
i
think
george
pointed
out
a
number
of
projects
in
a
number
of
states
that
stand
to
be
funded
or
to
lose
funding
if
this
jobs
package
doesnt
pass
q
no
democrats
laughter
ms
myers
ill
let
you
draw
your
own
conclusions
q
does
he
plan
to
talk
to
dole
again
today
or
any
other
republicans
again
today
ms
myers
theres
nothing
specifically
scheduled
but
again
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
does
he
plan
to
put
out
any
more
press
releases
to
any
other
states
today
ms
myers
what
weve
done
is
were
in
the
process
of
breaking
down
the
benefits
of
the
jobs
package
state
by
state
i
think
its
entirely
feasible
that
as
we
sort
of
are
able
to
sum
those
up
well
send
out
press
releases
to
the
various
states
that
suggest
how
their
states
would
benefit
from
this
package
q
will
you
share
those
with
us
ms
myers
sure
as
we
did
yesterday
q
do
you
have
copies
of
the
ones
you
sent
ms
myers
yes
we
made
those
available
yesterday
and
we
certainly
can
continue
to
provide
them
today
q
dee
dee
since
yesterdays
questions
and
subsequent
stories
about
the
vat
what
further
consideration
of
this
issue
has
been
given
ms
myers
nothings
changed
since
yesterday
i
think
the
president
commented
on
it
this
morning
to
say
only
that
it
was
something
he
knew
was
being
considered
by
the
task
force
and
that
he
has
not
made
a
decision
on
and
i
dont
think
we
have
anything
to
add
to
that
q
but
he
also
said
that
business
and
labor
groups
are
telling
him
they
support
it
can
you
tell
us
ms
myers
i
think
that
there
has
been
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
who
supports
it
i
think
the
president
said
that
there
has
been
some
support
among
business
and
labor
groups
i
dont
think
he
said
he
was
directly
contacted
by
them
q
are
we
to
take
that
to
mean
that
the
administration
has
sounded
out
business
and
labor
groups
on
this
ms
myers
i
think
theres
been
plenty
of
public
discourse
on
this
over
the
years
and
even
recently
but
i
dont
think
i
want
to
add
to
that
q
in
february
though
the
president
said
that
this
was
something
to
be
considered
or
years
down
the
road
what
has
happened
between
then
and
now
to
cause
this
administration
to
change
its
mind
ms
myers
i
think
as
we
said
yesterday
it
is
something
that
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
theyre
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
on
everything
from
funding
to
specific
options
that
will
be
covered
by
the
presidents
health
care
plan
the
president
has
not
taken
it
up
yet
has
not
made
a
decision
on
it
and
beyond
that
i
dont
have
anything
to
add
q
you
havent
answered
the
question
it
wasnt
being
considered
by
anyone
in
the
white
house
after
the
presidents
comments
in
february
and
george
reaffirmed
that
in
a
briefing
q
and
then
suddenly
q
what
happened
ms
myers
the
working
groups
as
we
have
said
throughout
we
instructed
to
consider
a
wide
variety
of
options
acrosstheboard
and
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
talked
about
and
that
they
are
clearly
considering
is
some
kind
of
a
valueadded
tax
q
but
the
president
himself
took
this
off
the
table
dee
dee
and
suddenly
it
reappears
and
this
goes
to
the
credibility
of
this
administration
in
a
way
what
has
happened
in
the
meantime
ms
myers
the
president
has
not
looked
at
this
it
hasnt
been
presented
to
him
again
yet
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
as
theyre
looking
at
a
wide
variety
of
options
and
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
and
it
raises
the
question
of
how
independently
the
task
force
is
working
ms
myers
the
task
force
was
instructed
to
consider
all
options
and
theyve
taken
that
mandate
seriously
and
theyre
considering
all
options
q
but
thats
not
the
impression
that
the
president
left
in
february
the
impression
he
left
was
that
this
was
something
that
was
longrange
to
be
looked
at
years
down
the
road
the
clear
implication
of
his
remarks
was
that
this
was
something
that
was
not
on
the
table
not
an
option
q
if
it
changes
ill
tell
you
q
bring
him
on
q
and
you
repeatedly
referred
to
the
presidents
remarks
telling
us
that
those
were
still
in
operation
ms
myers
its
changed
and
we
told
you
laughter
q
but
thats
what
alice
rivlins
comments
and
donna
shalala
comments
were
about
i
mean
that
seemed
like
an
orchestrated
effort
because
you
have
two
independent
cabinet
officers
ms
myers
i
wouldnt
no
alice
rivlins
not
a
cabinet
member
first
of
all
second
of
all
it
was
not
orchestrated
but
clearly
they
both
said
yesterday
and
in
the
last
couple
of
days
that
its
something
thats
being
looked
at
we
confirmed
that
yesterday
and
i
dont
have
anything
to
add
to
that
q
is
it
because
he
has
very
few
options
q
is
this
something
that
it
will
be
incumbent
upon
the
task
force
to
convince
the
president
about
in
other
words
has
the
president
himself
personally
ruled
it
out
and
its
now
up
to
the
task
force
to
convince
him
to
put
it
back
on
the
table
or
is
it
in
fact
back
on
the
table
having
been
placed
there
by
discussions
with
the
president
ms
myers
it
is
not
the
working
groups
mission
at
this
point
to
convince
the
president
of
anything
it
is
their
mission
to
put
before
him
his
options
and
to
explain
the
benefits
and
the
costs
and
the
basic
pros
and
cons
of
each
of
those
options
i
think
that
they
will
certainly
present
the
vat
to
him
in
that
context
and
at
this
point
hes
not
that
presentation
has
not
been
made
but
its
something
that
he
will
hear
and
he
has
not
made
a
decision
on
q
they
will
present
it
to
him
as
one
of
his
options
though
he
specifically
ruled
it
out
ms
myers
correct
q
dee
dee
is
this
more
than
a
trial
balloon
is
this
a
serious
consideration
that
the
working
groups
are
giving
to
this
form
of
taxation
ms
myers
its
simply
a
statement
of
fact
the
working
groups
are
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
on
a
number
of
issues
relating
to
health
care
reform
one
of
the
options
that
theyre
looking
at
is
the
vat
q
dee
dee
when
the
working
groups
were
examining
this
possibility
was
this
on
the
table
during
the
same
time
period
that
you
were
telling
us
that
it
was
not
ms
myers
i
dont
know
what
the
specific
timing
of
their
drafting
of
options
is
i
dont
know
q
who
was
telling
you
that
it
was
not
under
consideration
ms
myers
i
was
referring
back
to
the
presidents
comments
q
have
they
discovered
that
the
sin
taxes
wont
raise
enough
money
to
fund
the
core
benefit
package
ms
myers
no
theres
no
decisions
that
have
been
made
on
how
to
pay
for
the
health
care
plan
q
im
asking
whether
the
projections
ms
myers
theres
a
number
of
options
depending
on
how
the
plan
is
structured
you
cant
decide
how
much
the
plan
is
going
to
cost
until
you
decide
what
the
plan
is
going
to
look
like
and
so
you
cant
discuss
what
financing
options
have
been
ruled
in
our
out
until
you
know
q
dee
dee
weve
been
told
that
they
have
a
computer
models
on
a
number
of
possible
packages
ms
myers
correct
q
the
question
is
whether
they
have
now
determined
whether
sin
taxes
would
not
produce
enough
money
for
even
the
barest
minimum
package
that
is
not
a
very
difficult
computation
ms
myers
it
is
a
question
that
you
know
that
were
not
going
to
answer
until
theres
a
number
of
options
being
considered
it
depends
on
how
the
package
is
structured
the
exact
details
of
the
package
and
the
financing
mechanisms
used
to
pay
for
them
are
all
among
the
decisions
that
have
yet
to
be
made
q
and
when
the
president
has
been
meeting
with
health
care
his
health
care
advisors
which
we
are
told
he
has
been
doing
ms
myers
correct
q
they
have
never
once
said
to
him
these
are
your
funding
options
including
the
vat
he
has
never
heard
the
word
vat
in
his
ms
myers
i
am
not
going
to
comment
on
the
specific
nature
of
the
daily
theyre
not
daily
but
the
quasiregular
briefings
q
well
you
have
ms
myers
i
have
not
other
than
to
say
that
hes
not
considered
the
vat
and
i
think
that
is
a
true
statement
q
no
but
you
said
that
it
has
not
been
presented
to
him
as
an
option
ms
myers
correct
q
that
doesnt
mean
he
hasnt
heard
about
it
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
details
of
whats
discussed
i
think
that
statement
stands
for
itself
q
specific
dee
dee
when
you
say
he
hasnt
looked
at
it
do
you
mean
that
he
hasnt
looked
at
it
in
terms
of
paying
for
medical
coverage
or
hasnt
looked
at
it
in
general
because
back
in
chilicothe
he
was
very
specific
in
defining
how
it
works
what
the
advantages
are
the
whole
thing
it
sounds
like
ms
myers
but
that
was
i
think
in
chilicothe
if
you
go
back
to
his
remarks
there
it
was
a
broader
philosophical
discussion
of
the
tax
structure
and
i
think
the
comments
were
generally
in
reference
to
the
overall
economic
plan
but
clearly
its
something
that
hes
thought
about
in
the
broad
context
i
mean
that
was
clear
in
chilicothe
what
im
saying
is
that
in
the
process
of
the
working
groups
its
something
that
he
hasnt
considered
yet
its
something
that
the
working
groups
will
present
to
him
among
the
number
of
options
and
that
no
decisions
have
been
made
and
im
not
going
to
comment
any
further
on
the
details
of
the
meetings
where
health
care
issues
are
being
discussed
q
its
your
statement
from
this
podium
that
no
discussion
of
this
has
taken
place
you
say
that
no
option
that
the
option
has
not
been
presented
to
him
ms
myers
that
is
correct
q
do
you
stand
by
does
the
white
house
still
stand
by
georges
statement
in
march
that
this
will
not
be
in
the
proposal
ms
myers
no
decisions
have
been
made
we
have
nothing
to
add
to
whats
already
been
said
q
let
me
follow
up
here
do
you
stand
by
what
rivlin
said
yesterday
that
if
any
kind
of
vat
were
to
be
used
or
considered
that
other
changes
to
the
tax
code
would
have
to
be
made
so
that
it
would
be
less
regressive
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
comment
any
further
on
what
might
happen
if
q
but
do
you
stand
by
the
previous
conversations
in
february
that
if
there
were
to
be
a
vat
i
think
the
president
said
youd
exclude
food
and
energy
ms
myers
im
not
going
to
comment
on
the
specific
structure
of
a
decision
that
hasnt
been
made
q
was
the
president
aware
prior
to
donna
shalalas
comments
yesterday
that
this
was
under
consideration
by
the
working
groups
ms
myers
i
dont
know
specifically
what
q
could
you
check
for
us
because
thats
a
real
important
credibility
question
ms
myers
sure
q
since
the
task
force
was
brought
together
this
issue
has
been
discussed
at
the
beginning
and
throughout
as
one
fairly
painless
way
to
raise
a
lot
of
money
were
you
all
kept
in
the
dark
was
the
press
office
kept
in
the
dark
over
the
past
month
and
a
half
when
youve
been
denying
that
a
vat
tax
would
be
considered
that
it
was
actually
on
the
table
over
there
as
an
option
ms
myers
i
think
weve
said
all
that
we
have
to
say
it
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
about
it
yet
and
beyond
that
i
have
nothing
to
add
q
well
sorry
dee
dee
there
are
still
a
couple
of
questions
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
ask
because
we
have
a
problem
with
credibility
here
yours
primarily
what
were
asking
is
if
you
all
were
not
told
at
all
that
this
thing
was
being
considered
while
you
were
coming
out
here
and
telling
us
that
it
was
not
or
if
its
a
case
that
you
were
coming
out
here
and
deliberately
misleading
us
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
that
anyone
has
ever
come
out
here
and
deliberately
misled
you
from
this
podium
ever
ever
q
has
anyone
tried
to
shade
it
a
little
bit
to
indicate
something
has
anybody
told
anybody
to
come
out
ms
myers
were
not
trying
to
shade
answers
or
deliberately
mislead
anybody
ive
said
what
i
have
to
say
about
this
issue
q
all
we
were
trying
to
find
out
ms
myers
i
understand
what
youre
trying
to
find
out
and
ive
given
you
the
answers
helen
q
were
trying
to
find
out
what
changed
what
made
it
an
option
again
thats
the
ms
myers
the
working
groups
were
given
a
broad
mandate
to
investigate
all
options
and
they
are
doing
that
q
yes
but
it
wasnt
an
option
before
how
can
you
investigate
it
if
the
president
has
taken
it
off
the
table
ms
myers
it
is
something
that
theyre
obviously
considering
and
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
on
q
yes
but
he
took
it
off
the
table
in
february
ms
myers
working
groups
are
considering
it
theyll
present
it
to
the
president
at
some
point
and
hell
make
a
decision
q
why
would
they
consider
it
if
he
has
taken
it
off
the
table
ms
myers
its
clearly
on
the
table
q
yes
but
he
took
it
off
the
table
did
he
change
his
mind
ms
myers
its
back
on
the
table
bill
q
did
he
change
his
mind
ms
myers
he
said
this
morning
that
he
hasnt
made
a
decision
about
it
he
obviously
knows
that
its
on
the
table
its
something
that
he
will
look
at
at
some
and
when
we
have
a
decision
on
this
well
let
you
know
q
so
he
must
have
changed
his
mind
right
ms
myers
at
some
point
it
will
be
looked
at
i
mean
q
dee
dee
theres
like
two
options
either
he
changed
his
mind
or
the
working
groups
think
theyre
authority
exceeds
the
presidents
ms
myers
the
working
groups
were
given
a
broad
mandate
to
look
at
all
options
theyve
done
that
q
are
you
going
to
put
out
his
income
tax
ms
myers
yes
there
will
be
something
available
on
his
income
tax
probably
later
this
afternoon
his
return
will
be
available
q
will
there
be
any
kind
of
briefing
to
go
through
it
ms
myers
no
nothings
planned
i
think
someone
will
be
available
probably
not
in
a
briefing
setting
but
to
walk
you
through
the
questions
q
were
used
to
be
walked
linebyline
through
the
presidential
tax
forms
ms
myers
ive
seen
those
briefings
laughter
q
could
we
have
one
ms
myers
no
i
dont
think
there
will
be
any
kind
of
a
formal
briefing
but
there
will
be
somebody
available
to
answer
your
questions
about
it
q
did
they
file
a
joint
form
ms
myers
yes
q
when
did
he
file
it
ms
myers
i
believe
its
being
filed
today
q
dee
dee
is
there
going
to
be
a
backgrounder
for
miyazawa
ms
myers
no
there
will
be
a
readout
after
the
meeting
q
no
backgrounder
today
ms
myers
no
backgrounder
today
q
this
is
complicated
stuff
we
need
help
laughter
ms
myers
we
cant
give
you
taxes
and
miyazawa
all
in
one
day
its
too
confusing
laughter
q
vance
and
owen
have
opened
the
doors
on
the
use
of
force
in
bosnia
theyve
both
said
that
a
they
never
ruled
it
out
and
b
it
might
be
necessary
now
does
that
influence
your
thinking
on
whether
or
not
to
change
your
approach
ms
myers
theres
been
no
change
in
our
policy
towards
bosnia
we
have
always
said
that
wed
consider
q
but
does
that
impact
upon
your
decision
are
they
people
whose
opinions
would
carry
weight
with
you
ms
myers
theyre
people
whose
opinions
carry
weight
certainly
i
mean
the
president
supports
the
process
that
theyve
initiated
but
theres
been
no
change
in
our
policy
for
bosnia
although
were
considering
a
number
of
options
right
now
if
the
serbs
dont
come
back
to
the
negotiating
table
if
they
dont
sign
on
to
some
kind
of
an
agreement
we
will
consider
additional
options
which
weve
been
saying
regularly
q
one
followup
question
then
we
cannot
get
a
straight
answer
from
anyone
in
the
administration
why
do
you
not
set
a
deadline
for
the
serbs
can
you
tell
us
the
strategic
or
tactical
reasons
for
not
giving
them
a
deadline
to
come
to
the
table
ms
myers
were
continuing
to
put
pressure
on
them
every
day
q
which
doesnt
work
so
ms
myers
well
we
think
it
is
having
some
effect
were
going
to
continue
to
tighten
sanctions
as
you
know
we
support
the
omnibus
resolution
we
expect
that
to
come
to
a
vote
on
the
q
you
say
its
having
an
effect
can
you
give
us
any
documentation
ms
myers
id
be
happy
to
provide
somebody
to
talk
to
you
about
the
impact
of
the
sanctions
and
things
like
that
q
theres
been
no
you
have
not
been
able
to
provide
anybody
who
can
tell
us
that
the
sanctions
have
had
any
effect
in
bosnia
serbia
yes
in
bosnia
no
ms
myers
i
think
that
theyve
had
effect
in
serbia
and
we
think
theyve
had
some
effect
in
bosnia
and
again
ill
be
happy
to
provide
somebody
to
walk
you
through
the
details
of
that
if
youd
like
q
we
would
like
to
hear
from
someone
who
can
show
us
what
the
effect
has
been
in
bosnia
we
had
the
briefing
on
all
of
the
terrible
things
that
are
happening
in
belgrade
but
we
havent
seen
anything
that
indicates
an
impact
on
the
fighting
can
you
provide
something
along
those
lines
ms
myers
i
will
see
what
i
can
get
you
q
on
the
extra
russian
aid
that
christopher
announced
this
morning
where
is
that
money
coming
from
ms
myers
well
have
to
work
with
congress
on
the
details
of
that
package
q
so
that
would
be
new
money
that
you
would
hope
to
get
ms
myers
yes
thats
new
money
in
addition
to
the
billion
announced
in
vancouver
so
i
assume
that
you
all
have
seen
the
package
that
was
announced
this
morning
in
tokyo
by
secretary
christopher
q
isnt
there
a
concern
though
about
offering
something
which
you
have
to
get
in
congress
i
mean
that
was
the
concern
with
vancouver
you
didnt
want
to
do
that
ms
myers
the
concern
with
vancouver
was
to
do
something
immediately
which
required
money
that
was
already
approved
in
the
fiscal
budget
what
were
looking
at
now
is
a
little
bit
longerterm
plan
to
build
on
top
of
the
billion
that
we
announced
in
vancouver
this
clearly
will
require
congressional
approval
or
some
of
it
will
anyway
and
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
congress
to
make
that
happen
q
to
what
extent
has
that
been
vetted
or
agreed
to
by
congress
ms
myers
the
president
has
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
members
and
will
continue
to
work
with
them
as
this
process
moves
forward
q
was
christopher
able
to
put
this
package
out
with
a
fair
degree
of
understanding
that
you
will
be
able
to
get
it
through
congress
ms
myers
it
was
created
in
consultation
with
congress
q
in
meeting
with
the
law
enforcement
officials
is
that
does
that
have
a
set
speech
and
a
goal
a
direction
ms
myers
yes
the
president
will
talk
about
and
the
law
enforcement
organizations
are
endorsing
the
presidents
jobs
package
they
believe
particularly
the
summer
jobs
package
will
help
give
kids
something
to
do
q
who
are
they
ms
myers
its
members
or
leadership
from
three
organizations
napo
which
is
the
national
association
of
police
organizations
ibpo
which
is
the
international
brotherhood
of
police
organizations
i
believe
and
iupa
which
is
the
international
union
of
police
associations
q
will
the
fbi
chief
be
there
ms
myers
the
fbi
chief
no
q
or
any
other
federal
law
enforcement
officials
ms
myers
no
it
will
be
the
president
and
these
national
law
enforcement
organization
leaders
q
does
the
billion
announced
today
include
the
million
thats
in
the
fy
budget
for
disarmament
ms
myers
no
the
nunnlugar
money
is
separate
q
so
this
would
be
the
million
thats
in
the
budget
already
plus
another
billion
ms
myers
i
believe
all
of
this
is
on
top
of
the
million
already
in
the
budget
q
is
this
going
to
be
part
of
the
supplemental
or
fiscal
ms
myers
well
work
with
congress
on
the
exact
funding
mechanism
on
exactly
how
this
will
be
paid
for
q
this
billion
on
top
of
ms
myers
on
top
of
million
on
top
of
the
million
nunnlugar
money
we
announced
earlier
q
and
this
is
what
prompted
the
president
to
call
bob
dole
it
was
on
this
tranche
not
on
the
previous
money
he
was
calling
bob
dole
ms
myers
correct
q
is
there
a
briefing
on
miyazawa
ms
myers
there
will
be
a
readout
after
the
meeting
with
miyazawa
tomorrow
q
dee
dee
on
a
totally
unrelated
matter
some
republicans
who
are
active
in
the
us
chamber
of
commerce
are
complaining
about
this
new
cozy
relationship
between
the
white
house
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
there
are
the
town
hall
meeting
the
other
night
the
satellite
and
all
of
this
relationship
does
the
white
house
feel
that
youre
getting
too
close
to
these
chambers
of
commerce
ms
myers
thats
an
interesting
charge
laughter
after
how
many
years
of
democrats
being
accused
of
not
paying
any
attention
to
the
chambers
now
there
are
those
who
would
accuse
us
of
being
too
close
i
think
thats
interesting
but
no
were
thrilled
by
the
support
weve
received
from
the
national
chamber
and
local
chambers
across
the
country
and
well
continue
to
work
with
them
on
this
and
other
initiatives
q
whats
the
status
of
the
president
thinking
about
going
to
this
democratic
retreat
ms
myers
its
on
his
calendar
i
think
hell
almost
certainly
go
q
all
three
days
ms
myers
we
havent
figured
out
exactly
when
hell
be
there
yet
q
is
it
open
to
coverage
ms
myers
no
i
believe
the
whole
thing
is
closed
q
is
he
going
to
have
any
kind
of
address
statement
anything
at
all
on
the
gay
rights
march
on
the
ms
myers
were
still
looking
at
that
we
havent
made
a
final
decision
about
how
well
who
will
make
a
statement
or
what
q
any
meetings
scheduled
with
any
of
the
leaders
ms
myers
nothing
is
scheduled
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
q
what
about
an
aids
czar
ms
myers
its
coming
q
anything
on
the
weekend
q
theres
been
a
suggestion
that
hes
going
to
this
retreat
to
avoid
having
to
participate
in
the
gay
rights
or
appear
or
have
any
involvement
in
the
gay
rights
march
ms
myers
no
i
think
this
is
something
hes
been
discussing
for
a
long
time
appearing
at
the
senate
democratic
retreat
q
the
weekend
ms
myers
weekend
dont
know
the
only
thing
on
right
now
is
the
radio
address
on
saturday
q
any
travel
plans
ms
myers
if
it
changes
none
right
now
q
hes
not
going
to
be
off
campaigning
for
his
stimulus
package
ms
myers
no
specific
plans
right
now
q
what
about
midweek
anything
likely
ms
myers
its
possible
yes
i
think
its
likely
that
well
travel
next
week
certainly
the
weekend
q
has
he
called
thurmond
about
his
daughter
ms
myers
i
dont
know
ill
check
q
going
to
name
a
drug
czar
this
weekend
ms
myers
this
weekend
i
dont
believe
so
q
and
the
radio
address
on
saturday
is
that
going
to
be
focused
on
the
stimulus
package
ms
myers
im
sure
it
will

the
president
good
afternoon
ladies
and
gentlemen
two
months
ago
i
presented
a
comprehensive
plan
to
reduce
our
national
deficit
and
to
increase
our
investment
in
the
american
people
their
jobs
and
their
economic
future
the
federal
budget
plan
passed
congress
in
record
time
and
created
a
new
sense
of
hope
and
opportunity
in
the
country
then
the
shortterm
jobs
plan
i
presented
to
congress
which
would
create
a
half
a
million
jobs
in
the
next
two
years
passed
the
house
of
representatives
two
weeks
ago
it
now
has
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
united
states
senate
all
of
these
members
of
congress
know
its
time
to
get
the
economy
moving
again
to
get
job
growth
going
again
to
get
a
fast
start
on
the
investments
we
need
to
build
a
lasting
prosperity
unfortunately
a
minority
of
the
members
of
the
united
states
senate
have
used
gridlock
tactics
to
prevent
their
colleagues
from
working
the
will
of
the
majority
on
the
jobs
bill
when
congress
returns
i
ask
every
senator
from
every
state
and
from
both
parties
to
remember
what
is
at
stake
the
issue
is
not
politics
its
people
sixteen
million
of
them
are
looking
for
fulltime
jobs
and
cant
find
them
these
men
and
women
dont
care
about
whos
up
or
down
in
washington
they
care
about
paying
the
rent
and
meeting
the
mortgage
payment
about
putting
food
on
the
table
and
buying
shoes
for
their
children
about
regaining
a
sense
of
dignity
that
comes
from
doing
a
days
work
and
supporting
their
families
and
drawing
a
paycheck
theyre
asking
those
of
us
who
have
the
privilege
of
serving
to
put
aside
politics
and
do
something
now
to
move
our
economy
forward
i
am
prepared
to
do
that
and
i
have
been
working
with
the
senate
to
come
up
with
an
adjusted
package
that
meets
some
of
the
concerns
of
those
who
have
been
blocking
action
on
the
jobs
plan
im
willing
to
compromise
so
long
as
we
keep
the
focus
on
jobs
keep
the
focus
on
growth
and
keep
the
focus
on
meeting
unmet
national
needs
our
opponents
have
been
asking
for
a
smaller
package
today
i
ask
them
to
join
me
in
determining
exactly
what
kind
and
what
size
package
congress
can
approve
that
actually
meets
the
needs
of
the
american
people
but
even
as
we
make
those
reductions
and
the
package
will
be
smaller
i
believe
we
must
address
problems
that
are
on
the
minds
of
millions
of
americans
and
one
in
particular
and
that
is
the
need
to
toughen
law
enforcement
in
our
society
to
deal
with
the
dramatic
rise
in
violent
crime
so
i
will
ask
even
in
this
reduced
package
for
an
additional
million
in
federal
funding
to
help
local
communities
to
rehire
police
officers
who
have
been
laid
off
because
of
the
fiscal
problems
caused
by
the
national
recession
together
with
a
matching
effort
by
local
governments
this
could
put
as
many
as
police
officers
back
on
the
job
and
back
on
the
beat
in
communities
all
across
our
nation
at
a
time
when
too
many
of
our
people
live
in
fear
of
violent
crime
when
too
many
businesses
have
closed
and
too
many
people
have
lost
their
jobs
because
people
are
afraid
to
leave
their
homes
rehiring
thousands
of
officers
is
one
of
the
best
investments
america
can
make
and
i
ask
both
houses
of
congress
to
make
that
investment
in
our
peoples
safety
and
in
their
piece
of
mind
i
believe
in
the
need
for
strong
federal
action
to
keep
the
economy
going
toward
recovery
and
to
create
jobs
make
no
mistake
about
it
i
will
fight
for
these
priorities
as
hard
as
i
ever
have
i
will
never
forget
that
the
people
sent
me
here
to
fight
for
their
jobs
their
future
and
for
fundamental
change
i
want
to
thank
the
police
officers
who
are
here
today
and
tell
you
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
knew
before
they
came
here
that
i
had
determined
to
ask
for
more
money
in
this
jobs
bill
to
rehire
police
officers
they
came
here
because
they
believe
in
the
summer
jobs
portion
of
the
package
and
i
want
them
to
be
free
to
talk
about
that
they
came
here
not
out
of
any
law
enforcement
concern
other
than
the
fact
that
they
wanted
the
kids
in
this
country
to
have
a
chance
to
have
jobs
this
summer
to
have
safer
streets
and
a
brighter
and
more
peaceful
future
i
say
what
i
say
today
not
just
because
its
good
for
law
enforcement
but
because
its
good
for
the
people
who
live
in
these
communities
i
have
always
supported
community
policing
not
only
because
it
helps
to
prevent
crime
and
to
lower
the
crime
rate
but
because
it
cements
better
relationships
between
people
in
law
enforcement
and
the
people
that
theyre
hired
to
protect
it
reduces
the
chances
of
abusive
action
by
police
officers
and
increases
the
chances
of
harmony
and
safe
streets
at
the
same
time
these
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
we
are
trying
to
do
i
promised
in
my
campaign
that
id
do
everything
i
could
to
put
another
police
officers
on
the
street
over
the
next
four
years
this
makes
a
good
downpayment
on
that
this
keeps
in
mind
the
core
of
the
jobs
package
and
this
will
help
us
to
move
forward
so
i
ask
the
people
in
the
senate
who
have
blocked
the
jobs
bill
lets
work
together
i
can
accept
a
reduced
package
if
you
will
increase
your
commitment
to
safe
streets
i
do
not
accept
the
fact
that
we
should
reduce
our
commitment
to
summer
jobs
or
to
building
our
infrastructure
or
to
doing
those
other
things
that
will
create
real
and
lasting
prosperity
for
our
people
i
have
done
my
part
now
to
end
the
gridlock
i
ask
you
to
do
yours
i
want
now
to
give
the
people
who
are
here
with
me
on
the
platform
a
chance
to
make
some
remarks
and
to
be
heard
by
the
american
people
beginning
with
janet
reno
the
distinguished
attorney
general
q
mr
president
can
you
tell
us
do
you
think
that
the
jobs
package
could
be
put
in
further
jeopardy
by
controversy
over
the
suggestion
of
a
vat
tax
at
this
point
in
the
congressional
dialogue
the
president
not
at
all
i
think
it
should
have
they
wouldnt
have
any
relationship
one
to
the
other
first
of
all
i
made
absolutely
no
decision
on
that
you
should
know
that
theres
a
lot
of
support
in
the
business
community
and
the
labor
community
people
have
asked
us
to
consider
that
because
of
the
enormous
burden
of
the
present
system
on
many
of
our
major
employers
particularly
many
of
those
that
we
depend
upon
to
generate
jobs
and
to
carry
the
strength
of
this
economy
but
i
have
made
absolutely
no
decision
that
would
even
approach
that
on
that
or
any
other
kind
of
general
tax
q
do
you
personally
believe
that
the
american
public
is
ready
to
pay
for
to
have
another
tax
to
pay
for
health
care
i
mean
apart
from
what
business
and
labor
leaders
have
said
the
president
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
that
i
will
say
this
the
real
issue
is
how
quickly
we
can
recycle
the
benefits
of
all
the
savings
to
cover
the
cost
i
mean
that
is
everyone
knows
that
if
you
do
what
were
proposing
to
do
if
you
streamline
the
insurance
system
if
you
fix
the
system
so
that
theres
no
longer
an
enormous
economic
incentive
to
overutilize
or
overprovide
certain
services
if
you
provide
primary
and
preventive
care
in
places
where
it
isnt
now
every
single
analysis
shows
absolutely
massive
savings
to
the
health
care
system
the
real
question
is
whether
you
can
transfer
those
savings
to
cover
those
who
have
no
coverage
now
or
those
who
have
virtually
no
coverage
so
that
you
provide
people
the
security
i
have
no
idea
the
polls
say
that
but
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
the
polls
that
i
see
in
the
press
that
many
of
you
have
commissioned
they
say
overwhelmingly
the
american
people
want
the
security
of
an
affordable
health
care
system
but
i
dont
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
stimulus
and
it
certainly
shouldnt
have
people
want
a
job
first
and
foremost
they
want
that
more
than
anything
else
q
now
that
youve
announced
your
willingness
to
compromise
on
the
stimulus
package
can
you
tell
us
what
parts
of
your
package
you
consider
vital
and
uncompromisable
i
assume
summer
jobs
is
one
the
president
i
want
the
summer
jobs
i
want
the
highway
program
and
i
want
the
police
program
i
still
intend
let
me
say
this
i
still
intend
to
fully
and
aggressively
push
the
crime
bill
which
did
not
pass
the
congress
last
year
this
is
a
supplement
to
that
not
a
substitute
for
it
in
any
way
but
i
think
we
need
to
do
that
i
think
we
need
the
ryan
white
funds
because
of
the
enormous
health
care
burdens
to
the
communities
that
are
inordinately
and
disproportionately
affected
by
the
problems
of
caring
for
people
with
aids
and
there
are
several
other
things
that
i
think
should
be
done
we
have
to
do
the
agriculture
department
meat
inspectors
the
safety
of
the
public
depends
on
that
there
are
a
number
of
other
things
that
i
dont
i
dont
think
any
of
it
should
be
cut
but
i
have
given
senator
mitchell
and
senator
byrd
i
talked
to
them
and
senator
dole
called
me
yesterday
to
discuss
this
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
call
him
back
i
called
him
back
last
night
in
new
hampshire
and
we
discussed
this
and
i
basically
asked
them
to
talk
today
and
said
that
i
would
not
make
any
statements
about
any
specifics
until
at
least
they
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
see
whether
or
not
they
could
reach
some
accord
so
i
dont
want
to
be
any
more
specific
than
i
have
been
already
and
lets
see
if
they
can
talk
it
out
q
when
you
talked
to
senator
dole
and
senator
mitchell
did
you
tell
them
about
your
increase
also
that
million
that
you
want
that
as
part
of
the
package
the
president
i
did
i
told
senator
i
left
word
for
senator
mitchell
last
night
about
it
when
i
talked
to
senator
dole
i
dont
remember
for
sure
i
do
not
believe
i
mentioned
it
but
i
did
tell
him
that
i
was
prepared
to
reduce
the
package
and
i
wanted
to
break
the
gridlock
and
i
told
him
that
i
was
working
on
a
reformulation
of
it
so
that
in
the
hope
that
it
would
become
even
more
focused
on
jobs
and
the
kinds
of
issues
that
i
thought
the
american
people
wanted
us
to
address
and
this
is
certainly
consistent
with
that

the
question
i
think
then
becomes
do
we
the
general
public
need
the

i
certainly
do
not
nor
will
i
ever
need
this
train
in
lubbock
texas

the
inexpensive
air

provided

dallas

dont

people
in
dallas

houston
need
it
either
i
totally
agree
really
the
only
people
this
is
going

benefit
are
those
who

farther

its
about
time
we
have
a
president
that
might
actually
stand
up
to
the

our
men
and
women
in
uniform
must
learn
that
the
world
does
not
revolve
around
them
and
that
one
of
the
things
theyre
out
there
defending
is
our
right
to
be
critical
of
them
even
denounce
them
let
me
explain
something
to
you
environmental
policy
and
industrial
policy
must
go
hand
in
hand
our
nation
and
indeed
our
planet
cannot
afford
to
continue
ignoring
this
as
was
done
over
the
last
twelve
years
our
industrialenvironmental
position
has
been
downright
shameful
we
must
have
active
government
support
of
the
key
industries
such
as
telecommunications
microelectronics
medical
biotech
and
environmental
tech
meanwhile
weed
out
old
inneficient
highpolution
industries
that
are
better
left
to
other
nations
this
will
make
us
richer
help
produce
new
jobs
and
help
the
environment
to
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
i
heard
a
lot
of
this
in
a
speech
by
senator
john
kerry
dma
tonite
in
addition
its
time
we
get
really
really
serious
about
issues
like
overpopulation
globabl
warming
and
ozone
depletion
the
planet
on
which
we
live
should
be
our
utmost
priority
it
just
so
happens
that
that
it
takes
money
to
make
this
country
work
to
provide
the
services
that
people
need
and
to
help
solve
the
problems
that
need
to
be
solved
granted
some
things
can
probably
be
done
more
efficiently
for
less
money
and
should
be
but
some
things
are
going
to
cost
more
money
and
im
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
everyone
whining
about
taxes
all
the
time
you
want
to
live
in
my
country
you
pay
your
fair
share
i
cant
believe
what
hypocrites
people
are
when
they
ask
people
to
give
up
their
lives
for
their
country
and
then
complain
about
taxes
if
youre
willing
to
send
me

yes
basic

is
a
human
right
which
people
are
entitled
to
if
these

arent

enough
for

then
i
guess
weve
found
something
better
than

there
is
nothing
sacred
about
the
capitalist
system
and
if
something
be
it
socialism
or
anything
else
works
better
then
i
say
let
capitalism
die
make
love
not
war
contrary
to
popular
belief
it
is
possible
to
be
a
male
and
a
feminist
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
against
or
to
deny
equal
opportunity
to
a
majority
of
the
population
is
just
plain
wrong
and
trying
to
force
them
into
some
sort
of
tradition
role
is
even
worse
women
certainly
have
as
much
to
offer
this

as
men
and
the
day
that
gender
discrimination
is
finally
broken
it

i

yes
come

i
both
know
that
the
major
problem
of

today
isnt
a

its
a

willing

huh
tell

i

was

from

works

to
barely
be
able

herself
and
her
kid
barely
hey
shes
too
proud
to
go
on
public
assistance
but
the
only
jobs
she
can
find
are
menial
and
with
no
benefits
and
no
career
path
eitherthey
find
excuses
to
lay
people
off
and
hire
new
ones
rather
than
give

and
why
not
its
a

cheaper
oddly
enough
all
the
unskilled

semiskilled
people
i

manage

almost

maybe
she
needs

authorities
said
much
of

collected
by

was
confidential
information
obtained
illegally
from

they
also
alleged
that

was
sold

in

according

filed

justify

the

disguised
payments
to

for
more
than
years
by
funneling
a

to
beverly

who
then
paid

hochman
is
a
former
regional
president
of

antidefamation
league
the
league
which
initially
cooperated
with
police
has
denied
repeatedly
that
its
intelligencegathering
operation
broke
any
laws
league
officials
will
not
confirm
or
deny
whether
bullock
was
an
employee
and
have
said
they
simply
traded
information
with
police
departments
about
people
who
might
be
involved
in
hate
crimes
but
in
an
affidavit
filed
to
obtain
warrants
for
thursdays
searches
san
francisco
police
alleged
that
adl
employees
were
apparently
less
than
truthful
in
providing
information
during
an
earlier
search
conducted
without
a
warrant
david
lehrer
executive
director
of
the
los
angeles
adl
office
said
the
organization
has
not
violated
the
law
there
is
nothing
nefarious
about
how
we
operate
or
what
we
have
done
he
said
our
record
speaks
for
itself
the
police
affidavit
contends
that
lehrer
had
sole
control
of
a
secret
fund
used
to
pay
for
factfinding
operations
lehrer
according
to
the
documents
signed
checks
from
the
account
under
the
name
l
patterson
an
adl
official
said
the
account
was
used
to
pay
for
subscriptions
to
a
wide
variety
of
extremist
publications
that
might
balk
at
sending
them
directly
to
the
antidefamation
league
bullock
who
has
been
collecting
intelligence
for
the
adl
for
nearly
years
defended
his
efforts
during
a
lengthy
interview
with
san
francisco
police
he
said
that
he
gathered
names
from
many
sources
and
entered
them
into
his
computer
under
headings
such
as
skins
and
pinkos
but
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
under
surveillance
i
might
never
see
or
call
up
on
of
them
again
bullock
said
and
it
doesnt
mean
anything
that
theyre
in
the
files
its
not
a
threat
to
anyones
civil
rights
that
a
name
appears
in
my
files
under
say
pinko
in
recent
years
bullock
worked
closely
with
san
francisco
police
officer
tom
gerard
who
fled
to
the
phillippines
last
fall
after
he
was
questioned
by
the
fbi
in
the
case
a
former
cia
employee
gerard
supplied
bullock
with
criminal
records
and
department
of
motor
vehicles
information
such
as
home
addresses
vehicle
registration
physical
characteristics
and
drivers
license
photographs
using
files
gathered
for
the
antidefamation
league
gerard
and
bullock
also
provided
information
to
the
south
african
government
receiving
over
four
years
the
documents
show
the
file
on
times
staff
writer
kraft
which
was
apparently
sold
to
the
south
african
government
provides
some
insight
into
the
hitandmiss
nature
of
the
spy
operation
the
file
notes
that
krafts
articles
appear
frequently
in
the
times
and
are
well
researched
and
written
but
little
else
about
the
file
is
accurate
the
brief
entry
confuses
the
times
kraft
with
another
scott
kraft
and
provides
the
south
african
government
with
the
wrong
krafts
physical
description
photograph
and
other
personal
information
nevertheless
the
documents
provide
illuminating
details
of
how
bullock
for
decades
infiltrated
all
manner
of
organizations
from
skinheads
to
leftwing
radicals
searching
regularly
through
the
trash
of
target
groups
using
antidefamation
league
funds
he
also
ran
his
own
paid
informants
under
code
names
such
as
scott
and
scumbag
he
worked
closely
with
police
officers
up
and
down
the
coast
exchanged
information
with
the
fbi
and
worked
with
federal
agencies
including
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
it
was
bullocks
work
as
a
paid
informant
for
the
fbi
while
spying
on
behalf
of
the
antidefamation
league
and
the
south
african
government
that
proved
his
undoing
the
fbi
learned
that
he
was
an
agent
of
a
foreign
government
and
began
investigating
leading
to
the

vows

cooperate
with

investigation
by
richard

paddock
times
staff
writer
san

the
antidefamation
league
defended
its
record
as
a
civil
rights
group
friday
and
said
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
who
are
investigating
whether
the
organization
collected
confidential
police
information
on
citizens
and
groups
but
san
francisco
dist
atty
arlo
smith
said
that
antidefamation
league
employees
involved
in
intelligence
gathering
could
face
many
felony
counts
of
receiving
confidential
files
eavesdropping
tax
violations
and
conspiracy
police
have
accused
the
antidefamation
league
of
not
being
truthful
about
its
spying
operations
which
collected
information
on
more
than
individuals
and
political
groups
across
the
political
spectrum
hundreds
of
pages
of
documents
released
by
prosecutors
thursday
show
that
the
adl
maintained
a
nationwide
intelligence
network
and
kept
files
on
political
figures
even
so
smith
suggested
that
if
the
antidefamation
league
shut
down
its
spy
operation
prosecutors
would
take
that
into
account
when
deciding
what
charges
to
file
in
a
statement
released
in
washington
national
director
abraham
h
foxman
described
the
adl
as
a
jewish
defense
agency
which
has
fought
to
protect
all
minorities
from
bigotry
and
discrimination
for
years
foxman
said
the
organization
is
regarded
as
a
credible
source
on
extremist
groups
and
has
a
tradition
of
routinely
providing
information
to
police
journalists
academics
government
officials
and
the
public
it
has
never
been
the
policy
of
the
adl
to
obtain
information
illegally
he
said
like
other
journalists
in
order
to
protect
the
confidentiality
and
physical
safety
of
its
sources
adl
will
not
comment
on
the
nature
or
identity
of
any
source
of
information
foxman
said
the
antidefamation
league
refused
to
acknowledge
that
one
of
its
longtime
employees
roy
bullock
was
anything
more
than
a
private
individual
who
is
alleged
to
be
an
adl
informant
among
the
documents
released
by
prosecutors
were
detailed
statements
showing
how
the
adl
funneled
weekly
payments
to
bullock
through
beverly

attorney

i
hochman
roy
would
penetrate

and
needed

hochman
told
a
san
francisco
police
investigator
hochman
could
not
be
reached
friday
at
his
home
or
office
for
comment
despite
the
antidefamation
leagues
assertion
that
it
will
cooperate
with
authorities
san
francisco
police
said
the
group
did
not
turn
over
all
pertinent
documents

a
voluntary

of
the

offices
in

san

second
round
of

thursday
this

with

produced
a
vast
quantity
of

primarily
dealing
with
financial
transactions
smith
said
further
searches
may
be
necessary
and
it
will
be
at
least
a
month
before
any

are

but
no

mr
stephanopoulos
yes
the
president
had
a
good
talk
with
senator
dole
last
night
i
think
that
as
we
said
before
there
were
no
specific
compromises
on
either
side
although
it
was
a
very
good
discussion
about
the
jobs
package
and
about
other
issues
as
well
as
you
know
the
president
first
called
senator
dole
i
believe
tuesday
night
to
talk
about
the
russian
aid
package
they
did
not
speak
senator
dole
called
him
back
wednesday
morning
when
the
president
was
out
instead
he
spoke
with
tony
lake
and
at
the
close
of
that
conversation
indicated
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
the
president
about
the
jobs
and
stimulus
package
they
finally
talked
about
that
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
close
of
that
discussion
they
said
that
they
would
have
another
talk
last
night
which
they
did
when
the
senator
was
up
in
new
hampshire
and
although
there
were
no
specific
compromises
made
on
either
side
they
did
say
that
they
would
continue
to
have
some
discussions
and
thats
where
we
are
q
well
who
is
giving
in
where
is
it
standing
are
both
making
concessions
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
its
at
that
phase
no
compromise
has
been
made
as
the
president
has
said
consistently
he
intends
to
come
forward
with
an
adjusted
package
he
believes
in
the
package
but
he
believes
that
if
its
going
to
take
adjustments
to
get
the
minority
to
release
it
hes
willing
to
make
those
adjustments
q
on
the
subject
of
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
boy
q
can
we
stay
on
this
for
one
more
minute
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
we
have
a
problem
with
the
five
minutes
q
i
know
no
decisions
have
been
made
but
what
would
lead
the
health
group
to
believe
that
a
vat
might
be
necessary
mr
stephanopoulos
sorry
andrea
im
not
going
to
go
down
that
road
no
decisions
have
been
made
as
the
president
said
this
morning
a
number
of
groups
a
number
of
members
of
congress
a
number
of
other
organizations
have
recommended
that
this
be
looked
at
the
working
group
is
looking
at
it
but
no
decisions
have
been
made
q
to
follow
have
they
done
that
directly
through
him
have
labor
and
business
groups
been
in
touch
with
the
president
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
although
theres
a
lot
of
people
who
have
public
decisions
in
support
of
the
vat
but
the
president
has
not
made
a
decision
q
at
the
meetings
that
hes
had
with
his
own
task
force
advisers
have
they
discussed
the
funding
issue
and
what
the
possible
options
would
be
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
that
that
has
been
presented
for
a
decision
no
q
not
for
a
decision
but
has
it
been
discussed
as
an
option
mr
stephanopoulos
again
there
are
a
lot
of
levels
of
briefing
i
do
not
believe
that
the
vat
has
been
presented
to
the
president
as
okay
this
is
something
for
you
to
decide
on
q
youre
not
saying
he
didnt
know
it
was
being
considered
though
are
you
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
said
its
being
considered
q
he
knew
that
q
but
has
he
discussed
that
with
his
advisers
thats
what
im
asking
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
said
its
being
considered
i
do
not
know
what
level
of
discussion
there
has
been
over
the
vat
it
is
something
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
i
dont
even
know
that
its
q
but
he
didnt
say
he
was
considering
did
he
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
no
he
is
not
i
think
were
getting
into
something
of
a
metaphysical
debate
right
here
what
is
considered
q
well
he
is
the
one
who
said
i
havent
reviewed
it
mr
stephanopoulos
that
is
true
that
is
what
i
just
repeated
q
george
is
there
any
concern
here
that
as
a
result
of
the
definite
statement
he
made
in
february
and
the
promise
that
if
it
were
to
be
considered
hed
let
us
know
and
having
it
trickle
out
the
way
it
did
that
there
may
now
be
the
development
of
a
credibility
gap
on
this
issue
and
others
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
i
mean
it
is
now
public
knowledge
that
this
is
being
considered
q
is
he
or
you
at
all
embarrassed
about
the
absolute
statements
that
were
made
from
this
platform
to
the
effect
that
it
was
off
the
table
and
was
not
being
considered
and
then
to
have
it
come
out
not
from
you
people
but
mr
stephanopoulos
well
wait
a
second
it
came
out
from
the
administration
what
are
you
talking
about
q
what
im
saying
is
though
that
the
president
said
he
would
let
us
know
mr
stephanopoulos
right
q
you
people
then
said
you
said
i
believe
that
its
not
going
to
be
on
the
program
mr
stephanopoulos
on
march
q
on
march
mr
stephanopoulos
circumstances
change
q
well
i
understand
but
we
have
to
find
that
out
by
rooting
around
in
the
fine
print
of
an
interview
mr
stephanopoulos
rooting
around
i
know
you
did
do
a
very
good
job
there
to
read
the
usa
today
article
but
this
is
laughter
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
and
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
i
mean
that
is
common
anytime
you
guys
write
a
story
that
has
an
unattributed
quote
from
somebody
in
the
clinton
administration
the
headline
is
ill
look
at
it
right
here
and
ap
story
clinton
wants
more
money
for
spying
q
what
about
his
remark
that
if
it
were
being
considered
hed
tell
us
about
it
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
administrations
concerned
and
hed
let
you
know
q
and
did
he
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
absolutely
what
did
he
say
this
morning
q
it
had
to
be
dragged
out
of
you
here
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
of
me
we
had
the
deputy
director
of
the
omb
we
had
the
secretary
of
health
of
human
services
say
it
was
being
considered
that
is
his
administration
that
is
his
administration
policy
q
were
these
authorized
trial
balloons
or
were
they
orchestrated
leaks
i
mean
what
was
the
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
questions
they
answered
the
questions
q
youre
saying
here
that
it
didnt
have
to
be
dragged
out
that
you
more
or
less
made
it
clear
yesterday
you
were
considering
it
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
i
was
very
clear
painfully
clear
q
was
there
a
particular
political
strategy
in
making
it
clear
the
administration
is
considering
a
new
tax
increase
on
tax
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
was
just
this
issue
is
being
considered
they
were
asked
if
it
was
being
considered
they
answered
that
it
was
being
considered
q
george
the
new
york
times
q
why
do
it
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
they
were
asked
q
the
new
york
times
reports
today
that
secretary
reich
and
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
used
apples
and
oranges
numbers
in
order
to
portray
last
months
unemployment
figures
in
a
way
that
was
supportive
of
the
presidents
job
stimulus
bill
but
which
turned
out
to
be
totally
false
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
was
totally
false
but
i
think
laughter
the
chief
economist
at
the
labor
department
did
grant
that
it
was
an
inappropriate
mixing
and
they
say
that
q
the
question
is
is
the
president
concerned
about
behavior
that
amounts
to
corrupting
government
data
and
whats
he
doing
about
it
if
so
mr
stephanopoulos
the
chief
economist
has
said
that
a
mistake
was
made
it
wont
happen
again
and
thats
the
end
of
the
matter
q
isnt
that
the
same
information
that
goes
to
the
president
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
two
separate
pieces
of
information
i
think
thats
where
the
confusion
was
q
when
did
you
all
first
learn
about
this
mistake
that
was
made
mr
stephanopoulos
i
read
the
article
this
morning
q
and
as
far
as
you
know
is
the
president
aware
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
q
and
was
he
aware
of
it
before
he
read
about
it
in
the
new
york
times
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
not
to
my
knowledge
q
did
you
ever
hear
about
it
before
this
morning
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
q
wasnt
the
president
given
an
erroneous
spin
on
this
for
his
own
purpose
for
his
speeches
for
his
arguments
mr
stephanopoulos
well
again
im
not
sure
both
statements
are
true
what
the
labor
department
has
granted
is
that
mixing
them
in
one
sentence
essentially
was
misleading
they
said
it
was
a
mistake
they
said
they
wouldnt
do
it
again
q
did
they
drop
it
is
this
something
that
you
choose
to
spin
or
make
an
issue
of
mr
stephanopoulos
whenever
fewer
people
are
out
of
work
were
gratified
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
need
to
get
this
jobs
package
going
q
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
stimulus
package
for
a
minute
you
said
that
the
president
plans
to
come
forward
with
an
amendment
is
the
timetable
still
what
it
was
that
the
amendment
would
be
laid
down
on
monday
and
voted
on
on
tuesday
or
did
he
in
the
conversation
with
dole
talk
about
the
possibility
of
putting
that
off
for
a
few
more
days
to
give
more
time
for
the
discussion
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
at
this
point
theres
no
changes
in
the
schedule
at
all
i
dont
know
that
they
discussed
the
timing
like
that
q
do
you
believe
that
youre
closer
or
getting
closer
this
week
than
you
were
last
week
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
believe
that
were
going
to
pass
a
jobs
package
the
president
is
prepared
to
make
adjustments
in
order
to
get
that
to
happen
i
dont
know
where
the
votes
are
on
cloture
at
this
particular
time
i
dont
know
whats
going
to
happen
until
we
have
a
vote
but
the
president
believes
deeply
in
this
jobs
package
and
wants
to
get
it
done
q
has
there
been
any
indication
that
this
situation
has
changed
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
on
it
well
know
when
the
votes
are
taken
q
george
last
week
you
said
that
there
are
or
various
people
in
the
administration
were
saying
that
you
couldnt
go
through
dole
you
were
going
to
have
to
try
and
go
around
him
because
he
was
immovable
on
this
subject
of
a
compromise
or
at
least
the
compromise
he
wanted
was
not
anything
like
the
one
that
you
could
accept
this
week
youre
talking
to
him
is
that
because
youve
realized
that
the
peeling
off
effort
wasnt
going
to
work
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
because
senator
dole
wanted
to
talk
to
the
president
about
the
stimulus
package
q
he
initiated
the
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
secretary
reich
this
morning
said
that
in
fact
the
president
is
not
willing
to
compromise
on
this
bill
at
all
you
say
hes
making
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
that
thats
exactly
what
he
said
i
think
he
said
he
didnt
have
any
indication
that
there
was
any
compromises
yet
or
that
there
would
be
a
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
and
the
president
doesnt
want
to
compromise
but
if
he
has
to
make
adjustments
to
get
it
through
he
will
q
officials
here
yesterday
said
that
panetta
was
working
on
a
series
of
adjustments
that
might
be
made
public
before
the
actual
vote
mr
stephanopoulos
its
possible
q
today
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
that
will
happen
but
i
think
that
its
very
possible
that
well
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
or
senate
democrats
will
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
a
different
package
in
order
to
get
it
passed
q
as
we
understood
his
conversations
with
dole
the
first
one
was
some
discussion
of
this
and
ill
get
back
to
you
tonight
with
some
details
or
some
adjustments
or
whatever
the
phrase
is
did
he
offer
him
some
details
or
some
adjustments
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
question
of
how
detailed
i
mean
i
think
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
package
last
night
subsequent
to
their
conversation
yesterday
afternoon
i
believe
that
there
will
be
followup
discussions
today
in
the
senate
not
necessarily
between
the
president
and
senator
dole
and
let
me
just
reiterate
neither
side
has
made
specific
compromises
at
this
date
when
we
have
something
well
let
you
know
and
im
not
suggesting
that
senator
dole
has
accepted
anything
that
weve
talked
about
or
that
weve
offered
anything
in
a
hard
way
q
what
are
the
followup
discussions
if
not
the
president
and
dole
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
senator
mitchell
is
going
to
talk
to
senator
dole
q
is
that
a
threat
laughter
q
did
the
president
say
to
senator
dole
all
right
how
about
this
number
as
an
overall
size
or
did
dole
say
to
the
president
i
can
go
as
high
as
this
did
they
talk
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
a
negotiation
in
that
respect
it
was
more
of
a
discussion
about
their
positions
q
did
they
discuss
actual
numbers
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
i
know
they
talked
about
the
basic
outlines
of
the
packages
i
think
they
talked
about
the
programs
they
cared
about
i
dont
know
if
they
got
to
the
level
of
this
many
xbillion
dollars
q
does
dole
have
to
sign
off
before
there
is
a
package
mr
stephanopoulos
no
of
course
not
q
did
the
white
house
have
anything
to
do
with
the
protesters
who
showed
up
in
new
hampshire
today
where
senator
dole
was
speaking
was
that
in
any
way
organized
by
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
and
has
the
president
been
in
touch
with
senators
kohl
or
feingold
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
hes
talked
to
them
no
q
george
is
the
president
considering
the
more
palatable
fact
of
having
a
national
sales
tax
instead
of
having
the
haves
having
to
continuously
pay
for
the
havenots
and
is
he
going
to
scrap
his
proposed
tax
on
the
privileged
few
with
the
haves
having
to
pay
for
the
havenots
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
deeply
that
the
tax
rates
on
upper
income
americans
as
he
presented
in
his
budget
should
go
up
and
i
think
for
the
second
half
of
your
question
ill
refer
you
to
my
briefing
from
yesterday
q
george
on
the
subject
of
accuracy
in
information
you
suggested
the
other
day
that
the
stimulus
package
included
money
that
would
solve
the
water
problem
in
milwaukee
apparently
that
is
not
true
its
actually
waste
water
money
mr
stephanopoulos
its
waste
water
money
for
wisconsin
and
some
could
go
to
milwaukee
q
but
it
would
not
affect
the
drinking
water
problem
because
its
waste
water
money
right
mr
stephanopoulos
it
would
affect
the
water
treatment
overall
q
but
the
implication
from
your
statement
the
other
day
was
that
it
would
help
fix
this
disease
problem
in
milwaukee
now
would
you
agree
thats
not
the
case
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
of
the
specifics
i
know
that
it
goes
to
the
overall
water
treatment
in
wisconsin
q
a
leftover
question
from
this
morning
which
was
when
did
the
president
find
out
that
the
task
force
was
deliberating
on
a
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
sure
exactly
when
i
just
dont
know
i
assume
it
came
up
over
the
last
certainly
between
the
time
that
we
had
commented
on
in
the
past
and
two
days
ago
q
so
sometime
since
march
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
right
i
dont
know
the
exact
date
q
george
the
president
this
morning
mentioned
that
some
labor
and
business
groups
are
for
the
vat
tax
apparently
the
national
association
of
manufacturers
talks
about
perhaps
the
vat
tax
being
okay
if
it
replaces
the
btu
tax
so
does
the
president
feel
that
perhaps
this
might
be
in
place
of
some
other
tax
hes
proposed
or
is
this
totally
in
addition
to
the
other
taxes
hes
already
proposed
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
weve
said
all
we
have
to
say
about
the
vat
at
this
point
i
mean
theres
just
no
this
is
being
considered
by
the
health
care
working
groups
and
that
is
all
the
president
hasnt
made
any
further
decisions
beyond
that
q
but
it
would
be
to
finance
health
care
it
wouldnt
be
to
replace
some
other
tax
that
finances
it
wouldnt
replace
the
income
tax
for
instance
mr
stephanopoulos
there
have
been
no
discussions
on
that
q
in
terms
of
getting
a
vat
tax
through
congress
senator
doles
press
release
today
said
vat
on
tax
day
do
you
think
does
it
have
a
chance
of
getting
through
congress
would
it
have
a
chance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
no
idea
q
is
that
a
consideration
whether
you
all
put
it
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
that
would
become
a
consideration
if
the
president
were
to
decide
to
do
it
its
not
in
consideration
now
q
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
briefing
that
circumstances
had
changed
and
that
had
caused
the
vat
to
now
be
under
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
what
the
president
referred
to
this
morning
these
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
that
has
to
be
considered
q
those
are
the
circumstances
that
have
changed
thats
the
only
difference
between
now
and
when
he
emphatically
ruled
it
out
that
groups
have
asked
it
to
be
considered
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
he
said
q
is
that
true
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
was
there
in
fact
some
understanding
that
sin
taxes
would
not
produce
enough
money
for
the
health
care
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
deliberations
q
but
george
mr
stephanopoulos
no
what
the
consideration
is
as
the
president
said
groups
came
forward
and
said
this
is
something
you
ought
to
consider
the
working
groups
are
looking
at
it
q
is
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
since
his
prior
statement
and
your
prior
statement
on
the
vat
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
explain
how
those
groups
how
that
information
got
to
him
that
groups
wanted
it
was
it
just
reading
the
newspaper
or
did
groups
make
presentations
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
groups
as
you
know
the
health
care
task
force
has
met
with
dozens
of
groups
q
but
this
is
the
presidents
knowledge
that
these
groups
had
come
forward
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
referring
to
what
was
coming
to
the
working
groups
obviously
there
have
also
been
published
positions
in
the
newspapers
q
have
certain
groups
briefed
him
on
the
groups
presentations
to
them
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
briefed
him
i
mean
how
detailed
the
briefings
have
been
i
know
that
the
working
groups
decided
to
look
into
this
after
being
pressed
by
these
groups
q
what
kind
of
arguments
did
the
groups
make
that
were
persuasive
enough
that
the
president
would
change
the
position
that
he
had
enunciated
previously
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
its
just
theyve
had
longstanding
positions
that
this
would
be
a
good
way
to
finance
health
care
q
the
president
wasnt
aware
of
those
longstanding
positions
mr
stephanopoulos
he
may
have
been
at
some
level
obviously
hes
been
a
governor
for
a
long
time
and
he
knows
the
basic
arguments
for
and
against
a
vat
tax
q
what
were
trying
to
figure
out
here
youre
telling
us
that
the
only
change
the
only
thing
that
affected
this
change
in
the
presidents
attitude
toward
the
vat
between
february
and
now
mr
stephanopoulos
the
presidents
attitude
hasnt
necessarily
changed
i
mean
he
has
not
made
a
decision
q
i
know
but
the
president
said
that
it
was
off
the
table
so
did
you
and
youre
saying
that
the
only
thing
thats
changed
is
the
positions
of
these
groups
except
youre
also
describing
them
as
longstanding
positions
i
dont
see
the
change
if
these
groups
havent
had
any
change
in
their
position
thats
been
made
to
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
well
theyve
made
the
presentations
to
the
health
care
task
force
q
theres
no
relationship
at
all
between
the
fact
that
sin
taxes
that
he
had
said
suggested
in
february
that
he
favored
will
not
produce
enough
revenue
to
finance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
he
ever
suggested
that
they
would
produce
all
the
revenue
q
well
he
suggested
that
he
thought
that
those
were
appropriate
ways
to
finance
health
care
mr
stephanopoulos
he
did
say
that
i
dont
know
that
he
said
anything
to
refute
that
q
but
in
fact
has
the
task
force
discovered
that
there
wouldnt
be
enough
revenue
from
those
taxes
to
finance
the
kind
of
core
benefits
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
think
that
the
task
force
ever
suggested
that
there
would
q
george
if
he
advocated
a
vat
tax
would
that
break
his
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
his
programs
mr
stephanopoulos
i
cant
comment
on
a
hypothetical
situation
q
but
does
that
promise
would
that
promise
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
to
pay
for
the
programs
prevent
him
from
seeking
a
vat
tax
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
has
made
no
decisions
on
the
vat
tax
when
he
does
well
tell
you
and
well
explain
the
implications
then
q
which
specific
groups
can
you
cite
business
labor
or
otherwise
whose
recommendations
to
the
health
care
task
force
has
prompted
this
consideration
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
have
the
specific
i
just
dont
have
that
q
george
can
you
tell
us
to
what
extend
these
other
alternatives
for
instance
the
employer
tax
or
the
sin
taxes
or
other
financing
options
are
also
still
on
the
table
and
what
these
options
are
mr
stephanopoulos
no
as
members
of
the
task
force
and
representatives
of
the
working
groups
have
said
they
are
looking
at
a
wide
variety
of
options
i
think
that
ira
magaziner
said
that
there
are
different
options
under
consideration
but
im
not
going
to
comment
q
whats
the
scope
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
going
to
comment
on
them
no
q
whats
the
scope
of
the
need
how
much
are
you
talking
about
that
has
to
be
produced
by
one
or
a
combination
of
the
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
what
the
health
care
task
force
is
looking
at
q
since
theres
not
going
to
be
any
briefing
on
the
miyazawa
visit
two
questions
one
generally
what
does
the
president
hope
to
use
that
meeting
for
but
more
specifically
is
his
task
complicated
by
the
japanese
anger
over
the
vancouver
note
and
the
remark
about
market
access
at
the
press
conference
mr
stephanopoulos
the
vancouver
note
q
does
no
mean
yes
q
yes
and
no
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
dont
know
i
saw
the
prime
ministers
press
conference
where
he
was
asked
the
question
about
that
note
and
he
gave
a
very
gracious
and
complete
answer
when
he
was
asked
the
question
the
questions
of
trade
are
something
that
certainly
will
be
discussed
between
the
prime
minister
and
the
president
there
is
obviously
a
trade
imbalance
between
japan
and
the
us
that
we
want
to
do
something
about
q
also
in
those
comments
the
prime
minister
made
he
suggested
that
the
united
states
should
come
down
heavy
on
him
in
terms
of
trade
are
you
going
to
oblige
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
the
president
will
state
our
views
on
trade
very
clearly
and
our
views
on
the
trade
deficit
very
clearly
i
dont
necessarily
want
to
agree
with
your
characterization
of
the
prime
ministers
comments
q
that
we
need
specific
export
targets
specific
numerical
targets
is
that
what
hes
going
to
discuss
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
going
to
have
a
broad
discussion
of
a
wide
range
of
trade
issues
i
dont
want
to
get
into
those
specifics
until
after
the
meeting
q
why
q
thats
the
crux
of
the
issue
right
whether
or
not
does
the
president
believe
that
without
specific
numerical
targets
it
is
really
as
he
said
in
his
press
conference
sort
of
hopeless
that
this
is
going
to
change
very
much
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
we
must
have
pressure
on
japan
to
turn
the
trade
imbalance
around
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
the
specifics
of
how
that
would
be
done
q
but
does
the
president
believe
that
their
stimulus
package
announced
yesterday
will
rectify
the
imbalance
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
first
the
president
wants
to
get
a
full
briefing
on
the
stimulus
package
from
prime
minister
miyazawa
himself
and
then
hell
make
the
comment
on
it
q
how
about
the
russian
aid
package
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
about
how
the
us
views
that
secretary
christopher
saying
or
bentsen
saying
the
japanese
may
need
to
do
more
the
japanese
saying
that
thats
not
what
they
heard
mr
stephanopoulos
again
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
in
the
and
were
going
to
continue
to
press
for
help
for
russian
reform
russian
democratic
reform
and
i
think
that
so
far
we
had
a
very
good
announcement
out
of
tokyo
and
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
our
allies
for
bilateral
packages
q
do
you
think
the
japanese
need
to
do
more
mr
stephanopoulos
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
all
our
allies
to
do
as
much
as
we
can
q
secretary
christopher
was
asked
today
on
the
today
show
this
morning
what
he
thought
of
margaret
thatchers
comments
on
the
bosnia
policy
and
he
said
its
a
rather
emotional
response
mr
stephanopoulos
over
an
emotional
issue
q
right
to
an
emotional
problem
does
the
white
house
condone
that
kind
of
remark
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
secretary
christophers
remarks
speaks
for
itself
the
president
believes
also
that
this
is
a
deeply
troubling
situation
that
were
trying
to
find
answers
for
q
but
that
specific
rather
emotional
response
specific
term
mr
stephanopoulos
no
it
speaks
for
itself
q
in
connection
with
that
doesnt
it
seem
that
with
the
numbers
of
people
who
are
being
killed
at
this
very
moment
is
it
good
american
policy
to
put
off
some
decisions
that
might
be
made
now
to
help
boris
yeltsin
win
a
referendum
mr
stephanopoulos
for
example
q
to
take
stronger
action
to
take
military
action
air
strikes
anything
that
can
be
done
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
believes
that
what
must
be
done
now
is
to
push
harder
for
sanctions
he
is
also
as
you
know
the
administration
has
been
discussing
lifting
the
arms
embargo
he
believes
those
are
the
appropriate
ways
to
increase
pressure
at
this
time
q
what
is
your
response
to
the
critics
who
would
say
that
the
us
is
now
stymied
by
trying
to
help
boris
yeltsin
retain
the
presidency
mr
stephanopoulos
theyre
wrong
were
pressing
hard
for
the
serbs
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
were
pressing
hard
for
increased
sanctions
and
were
talking
to
our
allies
about
the
arms
embargo
q
you
were
putting
great
store
in
vance
and
owen
getting
people
to
agree
to
that
now
vance
and
owen
have
both
said
that
military
force
to
some
extent
would
be
acceptable
does
that
change
your
thinking
mr
stephanopoulos
clearly
were
going
to
listen
to
whatever
people
who
have
put
so
much
time
into
a
situation
have
to
say
but
at
this
point
the
president
is
moving
forward
on
sanctions
and
talking
about
the
arms
embargo
q
a
followup
on
a
dee
dee
comment
this
morning
she
said
she
would
be
able
to
provide
some
administration
officials
who
could
document
the
effect
the
sanctions
are
having
in
bosnia
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
do
that
or
do
you
have
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
what
she
said
q
thats
exactly
what
she
said
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
thats
true
but
what
she
said
we
would
look
into
the
situation
of
what
kind
of
evidence
can
be
provided
in
bosnia
obviously
if
there
are
connections
between
the
bosnian
serbs
and
the
serbs
in
belgrade
and
we
are
tightening
the
screws
on
the
serbs
in
belgrade
that
will
have
an
effect
over
time
i
do
not
know
day
by
day
minute
by
minute
what
kind
of
help
is
being
given
between
the
two
and
what
the
exact
effect
has
been
but
clearly
we
are
slowing
the
shipment
of
goods
into
belgrade
we
are
having
an
effect
on
the
serbs
there
what
kind
of
effect
that
will
eventually
have
on
the
bosnian
serbs
i
dont
know
but
one
thing
i
would
say
is
if
it
were
having
no
effect
at
all
i
dont
know
why
theyd
be
fighting
it
so
much
q
are
the
first
ladys
tax
returns
going
to
be
released
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
joint
tax
return
and
it
will
be
probably
later
today
q
is
the
president
considering
signing
an
executive
order
banning
discrimination
against
homosexuals
in
the
federal
work
force
as
part
of
the
gay
rights
march
here
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
theres
any
proposal
for
that
at
this
time
not
that
i
know
of
q
its
something
that
the
president
promised
during
the
campaign
that
he
would
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
have
not
seen
any
i
dont
think
its
anything
thats
on
his
plate
right
now
q
is
he
meeting
with
gay
rights
leaders
at
any
point
on
this
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
about
on
this
issue
i
assume
that
hell
meet
with
representatives
of
the
gay
and
lesbian
community
sometime
soon
as
he
meets
with
representatives
of
lots
of
different
groups
and
communities
q
do
you
know
if
thats
scheduled
mr
stephanopoulos
its
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
probably
going
to
be
tomorrow
laughter
q
its
a
good
thing
you
asked
q
whos
probably
going
to
be
there
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
q
how
long
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
thats
all
i
know
q
do
you
know
if
its
at
pm
tomorrow
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
time
it
is
i
dont
even
know
for
sure
if
its
going
to
be
tomorrow
q
environmental
groups
have
asked
him
to
make
a
major
speech
next
week
of
some
kind
is
that
going
to
happen
do
you
know
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
theyve
asked
but
i
think
the
president
has
always
planned
as
he
did
last
year
to
give
a
speech
on
earth
day
and
i
expect
that
he
will
if
its
not
exactly
on
earth
day
it
might
be
a
day
before
or
something
like
that
q
is
he
planning
to
sign
or
announce
the
signing
of
the
biodiversity
treaty
in
connection
with
earth
day
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
the
specific
timing
of
something
like
that
but
its
certainly
something
under
discussion
and
something
weve
been
working
on
q
campaign
finance
reform
mr
stephanopoulos
were
working
on
it
q
do
you
think
it
will
be
next
week
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
the
biodiversity
treaty
is
something
youre
working
on
i
missed
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
something
were
working
on
he
asked
if
it
was
ready
to
be
signed
and
i
said
i
didnt
know
anything
about
that
but
its
something
weve
certainly
been
working
on
q
do
you
know
what
organizations
might
be
represented
in
this
meeting
with
the
gay
and
lesbian
groups
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
q
do
you
know
if
he
is
going
to
reconsider
being
out
of
town
on
the
day
of
the
march
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
got
to
be
at
the
senate
meeting
in
jamestown
and
i
believe
hes
also
going
to
be
giving
a
speech
to
the
american
association
of
newspaper
publishers
in
boston
on
sunday
as
he
did
last
year
q
would
you
have
told
us
if
she
had
not
pressed
you
on
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
on
what
q
on
the
gays
mr
stephanopoulos
when
we
went
through
the
presidents
schedule
for
the
day
certainly
q
george
what
day
is
the
publishers
speech
is
that
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
its
a
sunday
q
and
saturday
hell

in
jamestown
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
so
youre
just
going
to
be
in
jamestown
for
one
day
mr
stephanopoulos
no
im
not
sure
i
dont
know
how
long
the
senate
thing
goes
it
might
go
overnight
i
just
dont
know
q
you
would
have
made
the
gay
meeting
public
right
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
if
we
had
the
meeting
i
dont
know
about
open
to
the
press
but
we
would
have
told
you
about
it
q
i
mean
because
it
is
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
first
time
in
history
a
president
has
met
in
the
oval
office
with
mr
stephanopoulos
i
didnt
say
it
was
going
to
be
in
the
oval
office
laughter
but
i
didnt
im
not
say
that
its
not
but
i
didnt
say
that
it
was
laughter
q
at
the
white
house
in
the
bush
administration
gay
officials
were
invited
to
a
bill
signing
ceremony
and
the
white
house
had
to
repudiate
having
done
that
so
i
just
wanted
to
make
sure
mr
stephanopoulos
well
the
president
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
q
certainly
not
q
what
marching
orders
did
the
president
give
to
general
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
they
had
a
very
good
discussion
for
about
half
an
hour
today
he
wanted
the
most
important
thing
was
he
had
a
full
accounting
for
american
pows
and
mias
he
will
obviously
look
into
the
circumstances
surrounding
this
new
document
the
president
stressed
that
he
wanted
the
fullest
possible
accounting
and
said
that
only
when
we
have
that
can
we
even
consider
any
changes
in
our
policy
towards
vietnam
hell
be
looking
at
vietnams
response
to
the
questions
raised
by
the
document
and
hell
also
look
into
investigations
on
discrepancy
cases
increased
efforts
on
remains
implementing
trilateral
investigations
and
access
to
military
archives
and
ambassador
toon
also
briefed
the
president
on
the
activities
of
the
joint
commission
and
on
the
document
q
vietnam
says
its
a
fake
what
is
the
dod
analysis
at
this
stage
mr
stephanopoulos
its
not
completed
yet
and
its
also
the
first
thing
that
general
vessey
will
bring
up
with
the
vietnamese
q
a
number
of
defense
officials
have
been
saying
that
they
think
that
the
or
so
prisoners
referred
to
are
in
fact
nonamericans
that
the
vietnamese
had
captured
who
they
referred
to
as
americans
from
time
to
time
do
people
mr
stephanopoulos
we
dont
have
any
final
determination
were
going
to
wait
for
the
complete
review
when
we
have
it
well
make
a
judgment
q
i
know
you
dont
have
any
final
determination
but
given
all
of
the
intense
public
interest
in
this
do
you
think
that
thats
a
likely
possibility
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
want
to
characterize
it
in
any
way
until
the
review
is
complete
q
george
was
there
a
topic
scheduled
for
the
speech
in
boston
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
is
the
president
going
to
have
a
press
conference
tomorrow
with
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
so
but
im
not
positive
yes
i
expect
yes
q
was
toon
in
with
vessey
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
he
was
in
on
the
meeting
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
what
was
the
question
mr
stephanopoulos
was
ambassador
toon
in
with
vessey
and
the
answer
is
yes
q
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
wall
street
journal
report
this
morning
the
presidents
distressed
about
some
of
his
press
clippings
and
that
perhaps
hes
distressed
with
you
about
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
well
i
do
have
a
response
i
think
the
article
was
highly
misleading
to
the
extent
that
it
implied
that
the
president
has
had
restricted
access
to
the
press
i
would
point
out
that
hes
answered
questions
on
occasions
more
than
any
of
his
predecessors
i
would
also
point
out
it
also
q
how
many
questions
mr
stephanopoulos
three
hundred
fiftyeight
on
occasions
q
how
many
were
while
he
was
jogging
mr
stephanopoulos
well
no
thats
actually
a
very
good
question
andrea
and
i
would
point
out
further
that
the
article
also
implied
that
these
questions
were
only
answered
at
tightly
controlled
photo
opportunities
which
is
just
patently
false
hes
had
press
conferences
in
either
the
east
room
the
oval
office
or
the
roosevelt
room
or
the
briefing
room
in
addition
to
questions
taken
at
photo
opportunities
and
that
is
only
the
q
oval
office
press
conference
when
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
answered
questions
in
the
east
room
hes
had
five
in
the
east
room
hes
had
one
in
the
oval
office
hes
had
one
in
the
rose
garden
hes
had
one
or
two
in
the
roosevelt
room
and
this
is
just
to
the
white
house
washington
press
corps
in
addition
to
that
hes
had
interviews
with
local
television
anchors
hes
met
with
the
editorial
board
of
the
portland
oregonian
hes
had
an
hourlong
interview
with
dan
rather
hes
had
interviews
with
local
press
from
california
florida
and
connecticut
q
can
you
address
the
question
of
the
attitude
the
article
implies
that
he
doesnt
q
why
doesnt
he
like
us
laughter
q
did
you
really
get
blamed
for
that
post
story
q
the
story
is
that
you
are
you
held
responsible
for
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
im
going
to
comment
about
this
q
are
you
denying
that
the
president
has
shown
displeasure
publicly
mr
stephanopoulos
i
am
not
commenting
on
the
discussions
between
the
president
and
myself
q
did
the
president
write
that
letter
to
chris
webber
mr
stephanopoulos
what
q
the
letter
to
the
university
of
michigan
basketball
player
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
yes
q
that
is
an
authentic
letter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
since
the
president
first
talked
about
the
vat
in
february
he
said
at
the
time
that
he
thought
there
probably
should
be
exceptions
made
in
basic
necessities
such
as
food
and
clothing
does
he
still
hold
that
position
given
the
impact
it
could
have
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
just
cant
comment
on
a
proposal
he
hasnt
made
q
george
does
the
president
have
some
agenda
for
this
meeting
with
the
gay
leaders
tomorrow
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
it
will
just
a
general
meeting
on
the
wide
range
of
issues
that
they
care
about
including
aids
and
other
issues
civil
rights
q
the
military
issue
mr
stephanopoulos
im
certain
it
will
come
up
q
is
he
using
this
event
to
name
the
aids
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
so
q
george
what
specifically
is
the
president
doing
to
prepare
for
tomorrows
meeting
with
the
prime
minister
miyazawa
mr
stephanopoulos
hes
had
briefing
memos
hes
had
general
discussions
with
members
of
the
treasury
department
the
trade
representative
and
others
q
report
yet
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
he
has
the
report
referred
to
in
the
times
but
ambassador
kantor
was
here
to
brief
him
today
q
he
was
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
does
he
intend
to
use
any
of
these
instances
that
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
dont
know
that
the
reports
been
presented
but
obviously
the
president
will
press
hard
in
any
case
where
he
thinks
that
a
violation
has
occurred
q
in
terms
of
the
wall
street
journal
the
thrust
was
that
theres
a
real
schism
here
a
hostility
do
you
think
he
feels
that
way
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
as
i
said
on
the
record
in
the
article
i
think
the
president
likes
reporters
again
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
still
misleading
the
thrust
of
the
article
was
that
in
some
way
some
attitude
which
the
president
may
or
may
not
have
is
affecting
access
when
in
fact
he
has
the
most
open
accessible
administration
than
have
any
in
recent
history
q
can
we
come
up
to
your
office
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
if
youre
invited
the
press
thank
you

up
at

by
mike

p
drug
use
is
on
the
rise
among
kids
as
young
as
eighth
graders
usually
and
theyre
using
more
lsd
and
inhalants
like
glue
and
air

says
a
new
survey
the
annual
national
high
school
senior
survey
on
drug
abuse
finds
statistically
significant
increases
in
eighthgraders
use
of
many
drugs
including
marijuana
cocaine
crack
lsd
and
inhalants
we
may
be
in
danger
of
losing
some
hardwon
ground
in
reducing
drug
use
as
a

among

is
at
its

point
since
tried
it
in

reducing

requires
a
different
kind
of
strategy
that
health
secretary
donna
shalala
says
will
be
part
of

plan
the

shows

im

the
propaganda
that
the

putting
out
by
showing
you
the

wars
real
status
to
help
prove
my
assertions
ive
also
posted
two
articles
from

that
clearly
demonstrate
that
drug
use
among
certain
age
groups
is
on
the
rise
if
wod
is
working
as
were
led
to
believe
then
drug
abuse
should
have
gone
down
substantially

the
reality
is
is
that
it
has
not
gone
down
very
much
if
anything
substance
abuse
is
on
the
rise
im
also
going
to
supply
a
possible
solution
to
this
problem
the

entitled

appears

are

blowing

when
they
talk
about

the

lobby
is
out

says

the
fact
is
theyre
losing

source
university

michigan
institute
for
social
research
report
we
are
not
winning
the
war
on
drugs
i
think
you
can
see
that
one
of
the
tactics
that
the
dea
employs
to
give
people
the
impression
that
the
war
on
drugs
is
being
won
is
to
selectively
quote
statistics
only
statistics
that
support
their
contention
that
drug
use
has
gone
down
the
excerpt
from
time
magazine
that
i
included
in
this
post
is
an
excellent
example
of
how
organizations
like
the
dea
attempt
to
deceive
the
public
usage
of
one
particular
drug
may
have
gone
down
but
at
the
same
time
usage
of
other
drugs
may
have
gone
up
aka
substitution
also
drug
usage
among
one
particular
age
group
may
have
gone
down
but
drug
usage
among
another
age
group
may
have
gone
up
therefore
if
one
takes
a
look
at
the
big
picture
taking
into
consideration
all
the
statistics
then
its
obvious
that
the
socalled
war
on
drugs
is
being
lost
perhaps
the
drug
war
is
being
won
as
far
as
illegal
drugs
go
but
if
one
factors
in
alcohol
abuse
smoking
and
use
of
inhalants
then
the
magnitude
of
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
can
then
placed
in
its
true
perspective
for
those
of
you
who
dont
consider
alcohol
to
be
a
drug
then
try
drinking
a
fifth
of
whiskey
sometime
and
then
come
back
and
tell
me
that
its
not
a
drug
agencies
like
the
dea
only
go
after
illegal
drugs
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
drug
war
is
a
fruitless
attempt
at
preventing
substance
abusepeople
will
merely
switch
to
another
drug
if
the
one
they
were
using
becomes
scarce
or
unpopular
the
solution
to
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
this
country
may
be
to
legalize
somenot
alldrugs
whose
toxicity
has
been
shown
to
be
within
reasonable
limits
you
wont
drop
dead
after
using
it
a
few
times
and
then
couple
this
with
a
massive
drug
education
program
the
reason
why
i
think
legalization
is
part
of
the
solution
is
because
people
seem
to
be
able
to
easily
obtain
drugs
despite
the
governments
efforts
to
the
contrarythe
money
spent
on
drug
interdiction
could
be
spent
more
effectively
elsewhere
eg
drug
education
additionally
legalization
would
reduce
crime
because
the
profit
motive
would
be
taken
out
of
drug
trafficking
which
often
goes
along
with
other
kinds
of
crime
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
addicts
would
have
less
reason
to
prey
on
innocent
people
for
their
money
and
posessions
in
order
to
support
their
expensive
habit
legalization
would
cause
the
street
price
of
drugs
to
fall
substantially
so
drugs
would
be
much
more
affordable
to
addicts
imho
the
way
to
reduce
substance
abuse
is
to
do
to
drugs
what
has
been
done
to
smokers
make
drug
use
socially
unacceptable
rather
than
try
to
employ
heavyhanded
law
enforcement
and
punish
people
by
incarcerating
them
as
you
already
know
people
in
the
us
smoke
a
lot
less
than
they
used
to
this
reduction
in
the
number
of
smokers
has
been
brought
about
by
public
awareness
campaigns
laws
restricting
where
people
can
light
up
warning
labels
on
cigarette
packages
taxation
on
tobacco
in
order
to
reduce
consumption
and
so
on
i
propose
that
similar
methods
be
used
to
reduce
substance
abuse
after
legalization
has
been
carried
out
they
are
as
follows
drugs
being
sold
must
come
with
clear
concise
information
which
states
the
possible
health
hazzards
involved
with
using
this
product
and
recommendations
on
how
the
drug
should
be
used
things
like
dosage
levels
and
how
long
the
drug
should
be
used
ought
to
accompany
the
packaging
the
drug
is
contained
in
all
drugs
should
be
taxed
at
a
rate
that
generates
a
lot
of
revenue
but
not
so
high
as
to
encourage
people
to
acquire
drugs
through
illegal
channels
part
of
the
revenue
collected
from
drug
taxes
should
be
used
to
fund
drug
education
and
law
enforcement
make
it
a
felony
to
sell
drugs
to
minors
people
under
the
age
of
anyone
can
sell
drugs
but
they
must
not
dodge
paying
the
taxes
on
drugs
or
sell
drugs
with
the
warning
information
absent
failure
to
pay
the
appropiate
taxes
on
drugs
or
omitting
warning
information
should
also
be
a
felony
establish
a
government
agency
whose
job
is
to
insure
that
the
purity
and
safety
of
all
drugs
is
as
high
as
possible
this
agency
would
try
to
prevent
people
from
getting
a
hold
of
bad
drugssomething
that
is
a
fairly
serious
problem
now
im
sure
that
many
of
the
things
ive
discussed
in
this
article
have
been
hashed
out
before
in
this
newsgroup
nevertheless
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
give
my
two
cents
actually
a
buck
and
a
half
all
at
once
so
you
could
get
a
good
idea
of
where
i
currently
stand
on
wod
go
ahead
and
tear
into
my
post
im
sure
there
is
something
in
it
that
you
may
wish
to
take
a
different
view
on
or
flame
btw
i
posted
the
articles
from
usa
today
to
not
only
help
prove
my
assertions
but
also
to
provide
information
on
lsd
usage
among
youths
something
which

p
a

says
drugs
are
easier
to

more

using

as
risky

results
from

signs
that
the

war
is
being
won

this
year
officials
are
retreating
drug
use
by

has
risen
according
to
the

for
the
increase
more

thats
not

the

result
in

for

shiff

it

real

a

would
proceed

think
a

something

make

worse

bad

it

the
problem

insuring

not

the
tool

private

it

if
the

any
reasonable
way
to
restrain
such
actions
other
than
utopian
dreams

marxism
fails
to
specify
how
pure

the

part

x
automobile
transfers
a

x
i
think
to

requirs
anyone

dealers
license
to
own

cars

questions
steve
lets
say
you
have
the
talent
and
inclination
to
fix
up
and
resell
cars
either
youve
gotten
good
enough
at
it
in
your
spare
time
to
bump
up
against
these
limits
or
you
would
like
to
do
it
fulltime
but
these
stupid
arbitrary
laws
prevent
you
from
starting
out
small
and
pulling
yourself
up
so
im
protected
from
a
hungry
neighborhood
competitor
willing
to
take
a
low
profit
while
working
extra
hard
to
fulfill
my
needs
and
youre
protected
from
doing
what
you
want
with
your
life
heres
what
i
see
libertarianism
offering
you
your
money
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
if
you
use
it
to
buy
a
car
it
is
truly
your
car
it
belongs
to
you
you
can
use
your
money
to
fix
up
that
car
since
it
is
your
car
you
can
sell
that
car
your
life
is
truly
yours
it
belongs
to
you
it
matters
not
if
someone
thinks
that
its
wrong
for
you
to
buy
and
sell
cars
within
months
rather
than
say
cars
they
may
dissaprove
but
it
is
not
their
life
or
their
money
it
is
your
life
and
your
money
my
money
is
truly
mine
it
belongs
to
me
i
can
use
it
to
buy
a
car
perhaps
your
car
perhaps
that
car
the
one
that
someone
somewhere
dissaproves
of
you
selling
and
presumably
of
me
buying
that
someone
could
go
to
the
government
and
insist
that
the
government
make
us
stop
it
but
the
government
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
doing
what
we
like
with
our
own
property
in
the
abscence
of
fraud
or
agression
and
it
would
be
powerless
to
stop
us
from
associating
with
each
other
this
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
a
utopian
dream
but
basic
human
decency
and
common
sense
a
real
grassroots
example
of
freedom
and
liberty
and
yes
not
having
a
few
people
acting
as
our
masters
approving
or
rejecting
each
of
our
basic
transactions
with
each
other
does
strike
me
as
a
wonderful
way
to

some

some
things
are
going

im
sick

tired
of
hearing
everyone
whining
about

all
the

you
want
to
live
in
my

you
pay
your
fair

some
people
pay
shares
that
are
more
fair
than
others
and
will
continue
to
do
so
even
with

the

hurt
from

and
shower
me
with

i
will

taxes
are

im
tired

the

getting

sure
they
pay
a

wealthy
they
are
i

what
hypocrites
people
are

they
ask
people
to
give
up
their
lives
for
their
country

then
complain

in

according
to

the

release
the

when
defending
themselves

communicating
with
each

and
upon
dying

percent
of

ant
population

to
this
subfamily
there
is
significant
concern
about
the
acid
the
ants
release
an
amount
estimated
at
metric

annually
which
is
equal
to

the
following
statement
was
released
on
february
by
the
science
environmental
policy
project
as
independent
scientists
researching
atmosphere
and
climate
problems
we
are
concerned
by
the
agenda
for
unced
the
united
nations
conference
on
environment
and
development
being
developed
by
environmental
and
activists
groups
and
certain
political
leaders
this
so
called
earth
summit
is
scheduled
to
convene
in
brazil
in
june
and
aims
to
impose
a
system
of
global
envionmental
regulations
including
onerous
taxes
on
energy
fuels
on
the
population
of
the
united
states
and
other
industrialized
nations
such
policy
initiatives
derive
from
highly
uncetain
scientific
theories
they
are
based
on
the
unsupported
assumption
that
catastrophic
global
warming
follows
from
the
burning
of
fossill
fuels
and
requires
immediate
action
we
do
not
agree
a
survey
of
us
atmospheric
scientists
conducted
in
the
summer
of
confirms
that
there
is
no
consesensus
about
the
cause
of
the
slight
warming
observed
during
the
past
century
a
recently
published
research
paper
even
suggests
sunspot
variability
which
is
directly
proportional
to
solar
activity
rather
than
a
rise
in
greenhouse
gases
is
responsible
for
the
global
temperature
increases
and
decreases
recoded
since
about
futhermore
the
majority
of
scientific
participants
in
the
survey
agreed
that
the
theoretical
climate
climate
models
used
to
predict
a
future
warming
cannot
be
relied
upon
and
are
not
validated
by
the
existing
climate
record
yet
all
predictions
are
based
on
such
theoretical
models
finally
agriculturalits
generally
agree
that
any
increase
in
carbon
dioxide
levels
from
fossil
fuels
burning
has
beneficial
effects
on
most
crops
and
on
world
food
supply
we
are
disturbed
that
activists
anxious
to
stop
energy
and
economic
growth
are
pushing
ahead
with
drastic
policies
without
taking
notice
of
recent
changes
in
the
underlying
science
we
fear
that
the
rush
to
impose
global
regulations
will
have
catastrophic
impacts
on
the
world
economy
on
jobs
standards
of
living
and
health
care
with
the
most
severe
consequences
falling

so
what
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in
child
molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
back
your
statments
with
proof
or
shut
up
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
but
many
of
the
people
who
will
be
marching
arent
homosexuals
but
other
members
of
the
leftist
agenda
again
back
your
statements
or
shut
up
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
not
surprising
remember
that
study
includes
homosexuals
as
well
hmm
tell
me
did
you
go
to
the
mickey
mouse
school
of
logic
you
have
just
stated
that
there
are
not
many
homosexuals
as
kinsey
reported
in
his
survey
and
the
surveys
of
the
kinsey
institute
since
then
you
say
that
the
reason
many
young
people
are
promiscuous
is
because
homosexuals
form
a
large
part
of
that
group
or
there
are
some
homosexuals
whose
lives
consist
of
having
sex
with
no
gaps
for
eating
c
using
your
logic
it
would
seem
to
suggest
that
on
average
gay
men
have
about
partners
each
a
week
try
to
think
through
your
arguments
carefully
or
then
again
not
because
i
like
to
laugh
every
now
and
then
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
and
what
did
this
study
show
for
number
of
sexual
contacts
for
those
who
said
they
where
homosexual
or
is
that
number
to
inconvient
for
you
it
wasnt
published
hence
the
argument
cannot
be
resolved
using
this
data
next
point
please
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
fuck
off
typical
homoseuxal
response
this
depends
on
the
premise
that
there
are
only
three
types
of
behaviour
gay
bi
and
hetero
this
has
yet
to
be
proved
see
an
earlier
post
about
the
kinsey
institute
of
grading
this
although
rough
seems
more
logical
also
you
use
this
would
show
defining
a
fact
and
not
an
assumption

they

you
put

like
david

in

kind

he
is
going

no

koresh
wanted
to
be

and
the

played
right
into
his
hands
if
the
government
hadnt
given
him
the
attention
he
wanted
nothing
would
have
ever
happened
secondly
the
davidians
were
expecting
everything
the

did
they
thought
that
they
were
facing
the

and
that
they
were

they

they

they
are
very
devout

didnt

got

they

they

there

the

had
good

they

look

david

has
been
arrested
twice
by
local
police
both
times
he
accepted
the
arrest
warrant
and
went
peacefully
so
the
feds
decide
to
arrest
him
how
do
they
choose
to
arrest
a
person
with
a
record
of
peaceful
obedience
under
arrest
they
throw
a
concussion
grenades
at
his
building
in
addition
we
know
that
weve
been
lied
to
initially
we
were
told
that
they
suspected
him
of
molesting
children
and
having
several
wives
but
these
are
not
atf
offenses
were
they
so
they
changed
their
story
several
times
and
the
original
warrant
is
still
sealed
and
we
were
told
about
the
rockets
and
ammunition
they
had
but
did
anyone
notice
any
ammo
exploding
in
the
fire
they
claimed
that
koresh
hadnt
left
the
compound
in
months
but
people
in
town
report
seeing
him
just
a
week
before
the
raid
how
would
i
have
handled
it
differently
well
first
i
havent
seen
any
evidence
that
the
bds
did
anything
wrong
theres
a
sealed
warrant
and
a
collection
of
stories
which
keep
changing
about
what
they
did
so
i
might
not
have
done
anything
ok
now
supposing
that
i
know
what
the
bds
are
being
arrested
for
well
theyve
got
a
history
of
accepting
arrests
so
i
send
officers
to
the
door
with
a
warrant
wearing
bulletproof
vests
covered
from
a
distance
by
sharpshooters
now
theres
no
good
reason

suspect

these
people
will
do
anything

why
didnt
anyone
try
serving
a

ok
going
further
they
refuse
the
warrant
it
becomes
necessary
to

you
plan
a
raid
you
hear
an
hour
before
that
there
was
a
leak
and
they
know
your
coming
so
what
do
you
do
well
change
your
plans
right
nope
they
go
ahead
with
it
anyone
including
sending

unprotected
men
to
break
into

it
was
idiotic
i
dont
know
what
i
would

that

never

the

that
came

should

the

halfway

population

so
for

the

half

if

are

they

only
are

this

that

quite
first
the
median
does
not
imply
that
half
of
the

it
simply
means
that
is
the
midpoint
between
the

zero
however
assuming
your

correct
your

is
still
invalid
if
of

have
had
more

and
you
deduct
the
assumed
of

males
what
remains
is
not

still
of

im
curious
why
you
think
that
particular
adjective
is
important
black
is
a
descriptive
adjective
that
describes
mr
king
from
many
of
the
newspaper
radio
and
tv
news
reports
i
have
seen
this
adjective
is
commonly
in
front
of
his
name
i
have
never
seen
anyone
complain
about
the
use
of
this
adjective
when
used
in
a
benign
manner
i
did
not
say
that
mr
king
was
a
no
good
black
i
do
not
know
mr
king
and
would
not
make
this
ascertian
without
some
evidence
to
this
effect
i
used
it
purely
as
a
descriptive
adjective
in
the
same
manner
than
many
most
news
people
have
used
it
in
the
past
no
one
is
questioning
whether
mr
king
is
black
the
question
arises
whether
kings
race
should
make
police
officers
afraid
as
hell
your
statement
seems
to
imply
that
cops
should
have
a
different
standard
for
large
black
guys
than
for
just
large
guys
in
general
the
original
poster
never
said
they
were
afraid
of
king
because
he
was
black
in
fact
the
officers
were
afraid
of
king
because
of
what
he
did
not
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin
it
is
you
mr
frank
that
read
the
phrase
large
black
man
and
cried
racism
in
a
typical
kneejerk
fashion
when
you

i

can
get
past
this
problem
maybe
the
real
problems
in
this
issue
can
be
discussed
that
two

later
you
dont

anyone
pointed

what

we

there
a

less

there
used

perhaps

not

they

presumably
the
people
that
were

in

in

were
much
more
open
about

than
today
want
to

again
that
probably
is

today
it
may

in

you

that
we

continue

a

kinseys
that
is
obviously
wrong
where
are
all
of
these
studies
you
have
cited
a
few
and
my
research
shows
that
there
are
not
that
many
do
not
confuse
a
survey
as
a
study
there
is
a
big
difference
asking
people
outside
of
a
polling
booth
and
adding
up
numbers
is
not
a
study
as
easily
of
been
gay
i
suppose
one
of
the
big
debates
about
homosexuality
is
whether
or
not
its
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learned
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
its
some
combination
of
the
two
based
on
what
besides
your
own
warm
fuzzy
feelings
but
this
is
what
you
base
most
of
your
conclusion
upon
warm
fuzzy
feelings
maybe
he
has
stated
an
educated
opinion
based
upon
the
studies
that
involve
genetics
and
psychological
influence
there
are
a
lot
of
those
types
of
studies
arent
there
try
reading
some
heres
something
to
ponder
upon
have
any
of
you
gaybashers
out
there
ever
considered
that
homosexuals
probably
deem
their
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
just
as
much
an
intrinsic
and
natural
part
of
their
life
as
heterosexuals
do
about
their
own
sexuality
in
other
words
someone
who
is
truly
alcoholics
share
that
feeling
until
they
hit
bottom
this
is
a
crap
statement
and
comparison
many
people
use
this
sad
and
stupid
argument
there
is
not
relationship
between
alcoholics
and
peoples
sexual
orientation
except
that
some
may
find
what
it
really
is
when
they
are
drunk
repressed
inhibition
released
unless
of
course
the
problem
is
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
mental
disorder
caused
by
childhood
sexual
abuse
as
a
number
of
recent
works
suggest
nonsense
this
simply
is
not
true
i
suppose
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
try
and
tell
you
to
understand
what
a
study
presents
most
of
what
you
cite
does
not
extrapolate
anything
you
do
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on
others
antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
if
people
in
general
would
stop
using
irrational
position
to
oppress
others
and
leave
our
private
lives
to
ourselves
i
would
have
no
support
for
laws
and
rules
to
protect
people
form
this
but
we
need
only
look
at
post
such
as
yours
to
see
that
they
lack
rational
thought
and
intelligent
outlooks
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness
remember
that

the
idea
of
a
minimum
wage
is
considered
a
good
one
and
in
these
times
of
economic
difficulty
the
washington
legislature
is
propossing
to
raise
the
state
minwage
from
the
federal
level
to
fifteen
cents
over
oregons
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
increase
does
not
keep
pace
with
inflation
that
the
minimum
wage
should
be
to
by
my
figures
so
it
is
proposed
that
we
raise
the
minimum
wage
to
per
hour
by
july
and
then
give
a
cost
of
living
increase
every
july
and
anyone
who
doesnt
like
it
is
obviously
a
country

where

was

though
probably
just
a

watch
the

carefully
the
cnn
coverage
was
fairly
decisive
the
first
fire
starts
in
the

this
is
three
storeys
high
and
there
is
a
flag
to
the
right
of
it

the
second
fire
starts
in
another
tower
which
is
similar
to
the
first
only
two
storeys
high
the
flag
is
on
the
left
in
the

picture
that
shows

the

cleraly
show

the

a
third
i
was
not

however
someone
else
identified
a
fire
shown
to
be
starting
behind
the
small
tower
in
the
second
flag
on
left

angle
the
flames
coming
out
of
the

this

colour
for

the
flames
were
those
of
a

liquid

the
explosion
that
occurs
mid
way
along
the

is
certainly
not
an

though
the
cloud

this
would

was
to
be

cache

ammunition
etc
in

i
did

any

depends
entirely

you
would

you

anything

a

fanatics
might
indeed
be

the

cant
accept
that
the

set
light

because
that
would
mean
that
koreh
had
murdered
children
that
would
mean
that
their
taking
his
account
of
the
murder
of
batf

would
be
even
less
credible
than
it
was
to
start
with
koresh
had
days
to
come
out
with
his

up

face
a

instead
he

the

must
obviously
discount
the

story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a

conspiracy

whereby
the

decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up

is
that
this
sordid
incident
is
being
glommed
onto
by

desperately
trying

it
makes

a

then
the

never

it
is
interesting
to

the
way
the

dance
around
the

of
one
of

moments
which
was
when
a
few
of
their

managed
to
blow
themselves
up
manufacturing
bombs
in
a
greenwich
village
townhouse
the
problem
one
of
them
said
was
that
they
were
so
caught
up
in
their
armed
struggle
that
they
forgot
about
their
own
personal
safety
and
werent
careful
but
of
course
that
was
societys
fault
a
society
that
didnt
instill
a
sense
of

in
the
people
so
they
neglect
their

if
the

him
the

he

secondly
the

they

they

you

ours

after

you

should

seven

is
the

just
about
everywhere
else
how
can
anyone
say
that
such
a
system
is
the
best
in
the
world
the
only
thing
the
usa
health
care
system
is
good
at
is
showering
wellinsured
patients
with
a
champagne
treatment
of
care
and
outrageously
overcharging
for
it
and
the
private
system
of
insurers
and
paperwork
is
so
bloated
and
inefficient
that
it
itself
sucks
up
over
billion
dollars
a
year
in
money
from
every
other
sector
of
society
individuals
government
and
industry
of
the
billion
dollars
americans
threw
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
health

costs
last
year
the
consumers
union
estimated
that
at
least
billion
was
thrown
away
on
overpriced
useless
and
even
downright
harmful
tests
and
procedures
and
the
most
bureaucratic
regulated
insurance
system
in
the
world
there
are
more
than
different
private
insurers
in
the
usa
but
did
the
private
competition
stimulate
more
efficient
paperwork
ask
any
doctor
whos
had
to
hire
a
fulltime
clerk
to
deal
with
it
all
the
competition
among
hospitals
is
driving
costs
up
not
down
the
competition
among
hospitals
for
both
doctors
and
patients
has
encouraged
the
hospitals
to
traffic
in
expensive
superfluous
equipment
spending
millions
on
expensive
machines
of
dubious
value
that
spend
percent
of
the
day
idle
isnt
my
idea
of
the
worlds
best
health
care
system
competition
among
specialists
is
driving
them
to
perform
dangerous
and
expensive
procedures
where
they
are
very
marginally
helpful
im
especially
thinking
of
heart
surgery
and
some
womens
surgeries
like
hysterectomy
and
cesarean
section
sound
like
the
worlds
best
health
care
system
ever
notice
how
every
time
someone
tries
to
bring
about
some
real
change
in
health
care
the
libbies
start
bashing
canadas
system
first
of
all
hillary
clinton
is
not
advocating
another
canadian
system
i
think
thats
been
made
abundantly
clear
in
the
news
for
the
last
couple
of
months
where
did
john
f
mcmanus
get
that
idea
anyway
lets
say
youre
a
canadian
living
in
a
small
town
near
the
usa
border
your
child
needs
a
complicated
procedure
only
available
in
city
hospitals
the
nearest
canadian
cities
are
hours
west
and
hours
east
and
theres
an
american
city
one
hour
south
which
way
are
you
going
to
go
is
it
because
the
american
system
is
the
best
in
the
world
or
just
for
convenience
it
still
amazes
me
that
people
cant
seem
to
see
more
than
just
black
and
white
on
health
care
reform
there
are
a
million
different
ways
we
ould
restructure
the
system
its
not
just
a
choice
between
total
government
control
and
total
private
control
i
wish
the
people
screaming
socialized
medicine
every
time
soemone
wants
to
change
the
current
syste
would
inform
themselves
on
health
care
issues
the
current
system
sucks
i
want
to
keep
providers
private
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
we
will
never
be
able
to
deal
with
the
deficit
if
we
dont
reform
the
health
care
system
purely
private
health
care
without
any
government
intervention
doesnt
work
hillary
clinton
is
not
thinking
of
nationalizing
providers
or
evern
insurers
how
can
you
scream
socialized
medicine
at
her
programs
dont
you
even
know
what
youre
talking
about
ever
see
clintons
graphs
of
projected
deficit
versus
year
for
the
rest
of
the
decade
notice
how
the
line
falls
then
starts
increasing
why
ill
give
you
one
wild
guess
as
to
which
component
of
spending
will
overwhelm
us
if
we
dont
do
something
about
it
peope
just
doesnt
get
it
the
current
health
care
system
is
a
cancer
which
is
killing
our
economic
wellbeing
costs
are
still
rising
percent
a
year
even
as
americans
by
the
tens
of
millions
go
without
or
are
forced
into
managedcare
programs
which
are
certainly
pretty
socialized
already

straight

i
didnt

back

just
do
you
expect
to
do
that
without
serious
reforms
what
is
it
about
the
current

that
you
would

and
how
would
that
help
how
can
anyone
read

live

faults
how
can

our

with

weaponry
than
standard

handguns
for

they

the

the

must
obviously
discount

story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not

for

to
simply
dismiss

incompetent
that
would
require
them

themselves
instead
they
have

decided
to
set

people
just
to
set

must
object
to
the
characterization

handling

as
gun
supporters
your
argument
tries
to
paint
the
batf
critics
as
rightwing
gun
nuts
and
just
mixes
up
two
issues
i
am
one
of
the
batffbi
critics
and
yet
i
am
a
liberal
and
just
as
antigun
as
you
are
i
just
happen
to
believe
that
everyone
has
civil
rights
even
religious
crazies
theyre
all
human
beings
not
some
nest
of
wasps
that
youre
trying
to
exterminate
the
batf
created
the
crisis
situation
by
the
way
they
handled
the
original
raid
it
was
well
known
that
koresh
regularly
went
jogging
outside
his
property
he
could
have
been
served
with
a
search
warrant
then
he
could
have
been
arrested
if
he
had
refused
to
comply
instead
officers
armed
with
grenades
invaded
the
property
this
escalated
into
a
shooting
war
with
tragic
deaths
on
both
sides
those
were
the
first
two
mistakes
the
bad
judgment
of
asking
for
a
noknock
warrant
and
the
bad
and
probably
illegal
way
the
alreadyunwise
warrant
was
served
at
this
point
the
situation
escalated
to
where
it
was
described
as
an
armed
standoff
and
a
hostage
crisis
thats
when
the
government
started
covering
their
traces
sealing
the
warrant
revising
their
reported
history
of
the
incident
etc
things
were
already
building
up
to
disaster
now
the
government
could
have
simply
closed
the
supply
routes
and
waited
but
according
to
janet
reno
that
option
had
never
been
seriously
considered
so
supposedly
because
the
agents
were
frustrated
and
fatigued
and
because

basically
i
think
this
tendency
for

suggest

this

none

this
is
your

which
is
not
backed
up
by
any

any
knowledge
according
to
one
survey
done
in
san

the
number
of
heterosexual

who
were
molested
as
children
was
on
the
order
of
the
number
of

men
who
were
molested

was
on
the

of
source
a

of

sorry
the

escapes
me
conclusions
that
can

none
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on
others
antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness
oh
you
definitely
have
a
choice
you
realize
of

that
you
are

the

how
are
you
planning

two

incidentally
we

women

were

of
the
compound
because
the
gun
loonies
were
firing
on
vehicles
with
amunition
that
has
a
range
of
meters
next
question
the
problem
is
of
course
the
laws
that
allow
a
bunch
of
raving
nutters
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arms
in
the
first
place
the
sequence
of
events
meant
that
there
really
was
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervention
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mounted
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempted
to
save
the
children
by
shooting
all
the
adults
it
really
was
a
no
win
situation
koresh
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
officers
instead
he
ordered
the
murder
of
the
children
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessary
to
beleive
the
words
of
a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the
suicidemurder
of
his
other
followers
according
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempted
to
serve
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
the
bd
seige
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
indefinitely
the
bd
were
quite
capable
of
commiting
mass
suicide
and
murdering
the
children
at
any
time
a
commando
assault
was
the
only
other
likely
action
that
could
have
achieved
that
objective
that
would
have
been
very
risky
orders
of
magintude
harder
than
antebbe
or
the
iranian
embassy
seige
airplanes
and
embassies
are
not
designed
for
defense
against

ranch
apocalypse
was
terrorists
are
far
easier
to
disloge
without
casualties
than
allowing
the
siege
to
go
on
was
not
an
option
either
besides
the
serious
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
any
moment
there
was
the
question
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
the
emmergency
team
on
standby
over
a
prolonged
period
the
longer
the
siege
went
on
the
more
mentally
prepared
koresh
and
his
followers
would
be
for
a
prolonged
siege
rather
than
go
in
prematurely
the
mistake
was
probably
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
getting
the
children
out
a
certain
way
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legislation
through
this
conspiracy
theory
assumes
that
the
batf
deliberately
got
of
its
agents
killed
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actually
enjoy
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
texas
being
shot
at
by
religious
nutters
still
the
conspiracy
theory
is
comforting
it
allows
them
to
pretend
that
waco
proves
nothing
except
about
how
incompetent
the
government
is
in
resolving
a
hostage
crisis
no
govt
in
the
world
has
ever
faced
a
comparable
situation
quite
probably
there
was
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peacefully
resolved
the
blame
does
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
koresh
was
allowed
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tipped
the
bd
off
in
advance
has
the
murder
of
atf
agents
and
children
on
his
or

there

please
come

no

straight
talk
just
how
they
would

about
keeping

down
i
didnt

the
first
thing
i
would
do
would
be
to
disband

medicade
they
are
a
primary
reason
why
health

are
going

to

the
people
that
are
currently
on

i
would
sell
their
coverage
in
blocks
to
insurance
companies
the
private
companies
would
bid
to
get
these
large
blocks
of
people
and
prices
would
go
down
to
get
away
from
strong
federal
control
on

i
would
pass
off
more
control
to
the

everyone
is
always
spewing
forth
about
how
wonderful
hawaii
is
doing
well
how
about
giving
some

incentive
to
try

what
i
would
not
do
is
try
to
implement
some
far
reaching
federal

program
to
cover
all
americans
because
this
is
the

way
to

how
can
anyone

how

one
sure
way
to

to

okay

do

cases
when
they
do
go

obviously
absolutely
essential
to
prove
malpractice
it
used
to
be
impossible
to
get
doctors
here
to
do
that
a
possible
advantage
of
the

you
wont
hear
about
from
the
ama
our

monopoly
is
exactly
the
same
as
in
the
us
if
not
more
powerful
now
that
they
can
dictate
insurance
payment
rates
but
i
dont
know
an
answer
to
this
one
anecdotally
my
friends
who
are
mds
including
my
main
buds
from
high
school
talk
about
how
hard
it
is
to
turn
states
witness
against
someone
else
no
direct
experience
there
though
also
in
some
circumstances
you
may
have
to
sue
the
insurance
plan
people
here
after
all
sue
health
insurance
companies
all
the
time
i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
disease
that
he
had
to
take
repeated
trips
to
seattle
to
get
treated
it
cost
him
and
his
family
something
like
and
the
province
years
later
still
has
only
reimbursed
them
for
or
so
well
what
american
private
insurance
plans
cover
travel
expenses
since
our
public
insurance
plans
are
publicly
accountable
one
can
raise
a
stink
in
the
media
to
try
and
extort
benefits
beyond
which
one
is
entitled
hey
not
albertas
fault
that
he
lives
there
if
he
lived
in
cheyenne
wy
his
private
insurance
wouldve
told
him
to
go
to
hell
for
the
travel
expenses
and
thats
that
an
hmo
would
have
just
kept
quiet
and
let
him
go
blind
well
yeah
tell
us
about
the
national
defense
medical
centre
outside
ottawa
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
bethesda
naval
hospital
since
not
all
hospitals
can
provide
everything
maybe
they
have
some
stuff
that
others
dont
ottawas
population
is
only
a
quarter
million
if
you
include
the
surrounding
counties
my
point
was
that
something
that
should
necessarily
remain
unpoliticized
has
become
very
politicized
to
the
detriment
of
its
mission
i
dont
think
that
this
has
been
shown
with
the
dmc
the
problem
is
in
a
system
where
hospitals
annual
budgets
are
approved
by
the
government
how
do
you
keep
political
considerations
out
of
medical
decisions
i
bet
that
if
youre
an
mp
or
mpp
or
good
friends
with
one
youre
put
on
any
hospitals
urgent
care
list
no
matter
how
minor
your
problem
which
is
ok
unless
youre
someone
who
gets
bumped
off
the
list
for
some
bigshot
people
of
influence
will
get
their
way
in
any
system
american
or
european
its
the
golden
rule
he
who
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
but
to
what
extent
does
it
affect
the
system
and
why
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessary
in
the
first
place
its
worth
thinking
about
its
regular
practice
in
a
hospital
to
figure
out
who
needs
to
get
at
what
facilities
dont
americans
have
to
arrange
in
advance
for
operations
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standards
being
applied
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverly
hillsstyle
treatment
to
everybody
its
not
a
big
brother
list
its
more
like
calling
around
town
for
a
table
for
dinner
yeah
but
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
especially
in
the
hospital
business
yes
and
the
tories
in
ottawa
are
trying
to
make
them
do
that
rather
than
hope
for
a
bigger
grant
from
the
feds
and
their
province
the
next
time
around
whether
its
using
mop
a
couple
of
weeks
longer
or
even
selling
services
to
americans
remember
our
system
is
cash
based
and
since
our
health
care
infrastructure
is
overbuilt
except
in
specialties
that
require
larger
populations
to
generate
business
why
not
the
alternative
is
closing
unused
wards
business
whether
canadians
would
be
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
services
catering
toward
americans
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
another
issue
entirely
it
must
be
noted
that
they
said
they
were
doing
it
partly
because
their
grants
from
the
province
were
getting
smaller
if
those
grants
are
so
insubstantial
why
the
need
to
attract
foreigners
to
make
up
the
difference
you
answered
the
question
yourself
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
its
about
time
that
they
acted
like
the
private
hospitals
that
they
are
personally
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialists
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actually
buying
insurance
thats
one
at
you
bob
rae
the
gdp
figures
are
combined
public
and
private
expenditures
for
total
outlay
and
are
compiled
use
the
same
methods
by
the
oecd
that
yield
the
figure
for
the
us
but
dont
the
us
figures
include
dentistry
and
optometry
where
the
canadian
one
until
recently
anyway
didnt
since
we
have
always
been
evaluated
in
an
oecd
style
i
dont
see
how
remember
oecd
counts
both
private
and
public
funds
and
in
canada
like
france
and
germany
of
health
care
spending
is
private
funds
ie
not
the
basic
health
insurance
money
so
what
happens
if
the
health
care
systems
financially
collapse
how
they
are
collecting
premiums
and
im
an
advocate
of
having
copayments
like
the
french
do
in
their
system
well
if
you
spend
more
than
you
take
in
you
go
bankrupt
its
that
simple
if
the
provincial
insurance
systems
find
themselves
paying
out
more
than
they
get
in
revenue
they
wont
be
able
to
pay
for
everybodys
primary
care
yes
the
infrastructure
will
be
there
but
will
everybody
be
able
to
continue
using
it
at
the
same
rate
minor
copayments
can
flush
out
abusers
remember
that
our
system
is
only
an
insurance
policy
but
our
costs
arent
rising
fast
enough
to
ensure
adequate
copaymentsdeductibles
last
year
quebecs
userfee
proposal
came
out
with
the
number
of
as
the
necessary
hike
that
could
be
done
through
a
copayment
rather
than
give
the
qma
a
raise
and
its
not
contract
time
yet
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
upi
clarinet
even
the
new
reform
party
a
breakoff
of
traditionalists
from
the
conservatives
with
a
mildly
libertarian
faction
holds
our
public
health
insurance
as
an
untouchable
but
that
just
a
few
people
have
to
be
reminded
that
its
not
free
the
average
canadianeuropean
is
more
fiscally
naive
than
their
american
counterparts
on
issues
like
these
but
no
mention
of
copayments
anywhere
to
be
seen
but
cutting
public
spending
all
over
the
place
and
bringing
back
the
death
penalty
with
little
haste
if
elected
i
know
that
for
petes
sake
i
live
right
on
the
border
i
know
the
canadian
system
isnt
socialized
medicine
unlike
britains
nhs
sorry
its
just
that
i
even
run
into
people
from
buffalo
and
from
michigan
who
dont
know
the
point
is
that
means
that
if
the
money
runs
low
in
the
plan
youre
out
of
luck
unless
you
can
afford
it
yourself
yeah
but
thered
be
a
lot
of
leadtime
and
a
healthcare
crisis
that
would
preclude
it
if
provincial
governments
as
bad
as
some
of
them
are
heck
we
have
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
spending
mess
made
by
the
conservatives
in
saskatchewan
embarassing
can
be
so
irresponsible
there
is
still
reallocation
health
insurance
is
so
important
that
its
about
the
only
thing
that
can
inspire
open
rebellion
and
violent
insurrection
outside
of
the
hockey
rink
right
now
attempts
to
get
the
system
and
its
users
to
learn
good
habits
are
being
treated
like
codliver
oil
would
the
private
insurers
take
up
the
slack
theyd
be
under
no
obligation
to
of
course
they
could
eventually
make
money
again
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
theyd
be
loathe
to
do
so
and
out
of
practice
in
handling
such
basic
services
too
some
of
the
companies
providing
extra
insurance
are
subsidiaries
of
american
companies
and
their
parents
provide
full
insurance
down
here
regardless
all
firms
up
north
can
easily
turn
on
cable
tv
to
see
how
well
the
american
firms
are
doing
by
being
involved
in
basic
coverage
the
private
firms
are
making
too
much
money
after
having
gotten
rid
of
basic
coverage
they
run
around
patting
them
selves
on
the
back
for
their
own
cooperation
in
providing
extras
for
those
people
who
deserve
it
yeah
but
eventually
its
going
to
create
a
kind
of
twotiered
effect
that
will
be
noticeable
after
a
while
like
in
britain
most
americans
are
fearful
of
a
singletier
system
seriously
there
are
few
areas
that
have
sufficient
population
for
a
twomoretiered
system
like
what
the
french
have
a

prof
dg
shea
has
cited
studies
in
the
nejm
that
indicate
having
a
population
of
is
necessary
for
adequate
competition
and
in
canada
there
are
only
four
cities
west
of
the
great
lakes
with
that
population
or
larger
anyways
the
numbers
show
that
costs
have
held
steadier
than
those
in
the
us
and
barring
any
future
chernobyllike
crisis
sudden
transients
in
spending
are
unlikely
in
fact
the
health
allocation
is
one
of
the
most
wellbehaved
sectors
of
spending
up
north
so
any
talk
of
bankruptcy
is
talkradio
fodder
far
away
from
the
border
if
the
provinces
hit
fiscal
rough
spots
and
have
to
cut
back
the
things
private
insurers
have
to
offer
will
seem
less
and
less
like
luxuries
and
the
gap
will
be
more
and
more
noticeable
this
wont
be
overnight
and
something
like
this
would
force
canada
to
have
a
system
more
like
the
french
one
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
and
the
change
will
be
minimal
ie
add
copayments

our

few

know

the

originally
tried

many

know
the
hardships
they
suffered
the

few
winters
because
of
it
after
arriving
the

made

the
new
governor
bradford
privitized
the
land
assigning
plots
to

family
according
to
perry
d
westbrook
the
change
was
immediately
justified
by
the
increased
industry
of
the
inhabitants
and
by
the
larger
acreage
planted
bradford
himself
acknowledged
this
failure
of
communism
he
wrote
the
experience
that
was
had
in
this
common
course
and
condition
tried
sundry
years
and
that
amongst
godly
and
sober
men
may
well
evince
the
vanity
of
that
conceit
of
platos
and
other
ancients
applauded
by
some
of
later
times
that
the
taking
away
of
property
and
bringing
in
community
into
a
commonwealth
would
make
them
happy
and
flourishing
as
if
they
were
wiser
than
god
for
this
community
so
far
as
it
was
was
found
to
breed
much
confusion
and
discontent
and
retard
much
employment
that
would
have
been
to
their
benefit
and
comfort
bradford
did
not
blame
this
failure
on
the
strangers
but
on
the
basic
selfishness
in
all
men
he
wrote
seeing
all
men
have
this
corruption
in
them
god
in
his
wisdom
saw
another
course
fitter
for
them
in
other
words
according
to
westbrook
bradford
found
private
enterprise
to
be
the
most
suitable
economic
policy
for
mankind
in
its
fallen
state
lets
not
make
the
same
mistake
that
the
pilgrims
made
private
property
allows

the

this

avoids
all

it
strikes
many
of

dogmatic
to
say
the

no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical

education
national

a

efficient
means
of

than
is
provided
through

with
some

anything

there
is
status
attached
to
being

constantly

with
gay
men
where
both

can
prove
status
through
their

verility
then
you
are
going

get
a
situation

there

of

the
difference
is
between
het
sex
being

the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
now
lets
take
a
quick
look
at
what
you
are
saying
the
median
of
a
distribution
is
that
variatevalue
which
divides
the
distribution
halfway
ie
of
the
distribution
population
have
lower
and
half
have
higher
variatevalues
so
for
males
the
this
means
that
half
of
these
men
are
higher
than
this
and
half
are
lower
than
this
now
if
the
population
sample
size
is
and
of
them
are
gay
males
are
gay
if
we
actually
were
either
exclusively
homosexual
or
bisexual
you
arent
readiing
very
carefully
say
they
are
distributed
equally
then
only
are
greater
than
sexual
partners
of
course
this
means
that
heterosexual
men
are
greater
than
interesting

i
believe
that
this
is
not

on
the
basis
that
the
quality
of
media
reporting
varies
greatly
based
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
media
has
proven
itself
very
accurate
is
the
areas
of
presenting
raw
undisputed
data
one
good
example
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatures
of
the
previous
day
for
a
large
number
of
locations
are
posting
there
is
little
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
the
american
media
has
failed
us
in
its
analysis
of
complex
events
however
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
many
news
stories
that
have
left
us
angry
because
so
many
facts
have
been
ommitted
cases
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invasion
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disaster
in
waco
the
issues
surrounding
the
acceptance
of
gays
into
the
military
the
war
on
drugs
and
many
others
the
story
that
you
bring
to
light
was
regarding
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazyness
some
of
the
data
was
ommitted
from
the
article
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
the
data
that
was
presented
did
not
deviate
from
the
survey
i
do
however
think
that
it
would
be
folly
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
single
newswriters
analysis
of
this
data
in
this
particular
case
there
was
little
analysis
and
the
reader
was
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convictions
many
netters
mr
cramer
included
often
forget
that
the
american
media
are
merely
a
number
of
businesses
whos
purpose
in
life
is
to
make
money
for
their
owners
and
stockholders
revenues
come
largely
from
advertisers
who
merely
want
maximum
useful
exposure
per
dollar
the
media
is
like
fast
food
the
quality
of
the
food
or
of
the
reporting
will
improve
only
if
the
customers
demand
as
such
otherwise
it
is
business

the

secure

a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper

has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary

protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of

at

this

preserves

the

which
reported
that
to
percent
of
the

used
the
criteria
of
no
heterosexual

in
the

but
at
the

the
university

study
points
out
quite
dramatically
that
of
all
selfidentifying
gay
men
have
had
some
form
of
heterosexual
contact
in
the

i
think
the
big
mistake
in
that

must
be
that
if
one
had
had
no

in

they

the
nejm
study
that
compared
crime
in
seattle
and
vancouver
bc
the
nongun
rates
were
roughly
the
same
for
both
cities
the
difference
in
violent
crime
rates
was
almost
totally
gunrelated
and
as
was
not
pointed
out
in
the
study
but
in
critiques
of
it
two
seperate
articles
by
james
wright
and
david
kopel
come
to
mind
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
difference
was
also
almost
entirely
minority
related
that
is
the
gun
crime
rate
skyrocketed
for
poor
minorities
blacks
and
hispanics
primarily
while
when
you
compared
the
white
majority
they
were
virutally
identical
many
of
the
people
who
never
read
the
nejm
article
believe
that
this
critique
is
valid
in
fact
the
study
explores
the
minority
issue
at
length
and
cites
studies
to
back
up
its
contention
that
poverty
not
minority
type
is
the
relevant
factor
in
violence
statistics
perhaps
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
minorities
in
the
us
correlate
with
poverty
this
isnt
good
and
we
should
address
it
but
we
shouldnt
ignore
that
minorities
and
poverty
do
tend
to
go
together
does
vancouver
have
a
consistantly
poor
population
drawn
along
racial
lines
if
it
doesnt
then
assumptions
of
being
able
to
compare
minority
vs
majority
in
both
cities
is
questionable
at
best
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
those
areas
implemented
gun
control
because
of
the
high
rates
true
only
to
a
certain
extent
take
washington
dc
where
gun
control
was
instituted
while
it
had
crime
problems
true
but
that
crime
proceeded
to
explode
afterwards
similarly
for
new
york
actually
i
dont
know
whether
any
serious
studies
have
been
done
for
both
cities
usenetstyle
statistical
arguments
are
not
very
serious
usually
involving
people
sitting
by
computers
with
the
latest
world
almanac
figures
i
had
heard
of
a
study
on
washington
dc
that
seemed
to
indicate
a
significant
drop
in
gunrelated
violence
there
after
the
laws
were
implemented
i
heard
gary
kleck
comment
on
the
radio
that
he
thought
the
decline
in
suicide
rates
was
related
to
the
new
laws
but
he
doubted
their
affect
on
other
gunrelated
violence
i
have
never
seen
a
report
on
the
study
nor
have
any
of
my
progun
friends
had
much
to
say
about
that
report
remember
you
cant
just
say
that
crime
increases
indicate
a
failure
of
the
laws
to
affect
crime
rates
you
dont
know
whether
the
rate
of
increase
would
have
been
different
without
the
laws
if
the
rate
of
increase
over
a
period
of
several
years
remains
unchanged
or
increases
i
think
its
not
a
far
jump
to
say
that
the
laws
are
not
effective
no
you
cant
sit
down
and
say
that
things
wouldnt
have
been
worse
i
dont
have
a
crystal
ball
and
neither
do
you
however
that
road
leads
us
to
a
place
where
it
is
impossible
to
critique
any
action
if
it
gets
down
to
be
it
might
have
been
worse
without
them
then
there
is
no
valid
objection
which
im
sure
would
amuse
certain
people
to
no
end
you
dont
know
whether
the
laws
prevented
a
threefoldincrease
or
failed
to
stop
a
twofold
increase
so
weve
got
a
situation
where
we
have
several
options
the
crime
rate
decreased
obviously
gun
control
worked
the
crime
rate
remained
the
same
it
would
have
been
worse
without
gun
control
the
crime
rate
increased
perhaps
the
laws
prevented
an
even
bigger
increase
cute
testing
ground
weve
got
all
responses
support
the
proposition
that
gun
control
works
the
question
is
this
did
washington
dc
experiance
an
increase
in
its
violent
andor
gun
crime
rate
which
was
greater
than
the
pattern
indicated
prior
to
the
implemented
gun
control
laws
if
it
did
then
the
suggestion
that
the
problem
the
gun

laws
were
designed
to
control
did
not
exist

matt
freivald
said
i
like
to
call
the
form
of
government
that
i
advocate
fractal
federalism
with
fractal
federalism
there
is
a
representative
national
government
that
has
only
certain
limited
powers
to
do
what
is
absolutely
necessary
at
that
level
next
there
are
the
state
governments
again
with
only
absolutely
necessary
powers
onward
to
counties
citiestownships
districts
and
neighborhoods
the
lowest
read
most
local
levels
are
the
ones
that
have
the
most
power
over
individuals
daytoday
lives
which
is
good
because
that
is
the
level
where
individuals
have
the
most
voice
you
know
if
you
take
all
this
to
its
logical
conclusion
doesnt
it
seem
that
the
real
lowest
level
the
level
where
individuals
have
the
most
voice
is
that
of
the
single
individuals
themselves
why
have
you
omitted
that
level
from
your
model
yes
and
the
individual
is
not
omitted
i
just
didnt
fully
articulate
the
principles
of
fractal
federalism
all
government
powers
derive
from
the
people
each
level
can
receive
a
new
power
from
the
level
below
through
the
amendment
process
where
a
true
consensus
say
a
majority
writes
that
power
into
the
constitution
of
the
level
above
in
the
case
of
the
lowest
level
an
amendement
is
passed
by
a
majority
vote
in
the
case
of
higher
levels
it
must
be
passed
by
of
the
legislatures
we
can
of
course
haggle
about
the
specifics
of
true
consensus
when
we
hold
our
constitutional
convention
once
a
power
has
been
granted
it
may
be
exercised
by
the
legislature
powers
not
in
the
original
constitutions
must
percolate
upward
starting
from
the
individual
the
ratification
process
for
the
original
constitutions
should
involve
consensus
and
not
simply
a
plurality
or
majority
granting
a
right
in
a
constitution
is
of
course
the
same
as
empowering
the
government
at
that
level
to
restrict
the
activities
of
the
governments
at
the
lower
levels
so
it
operates
in
the
same
way
as
the
amendment
process
again
that
crazy
resemblance
to
the
supposedbutnotactual
us
government
structure
this
government
structure
is
a
very
frustrating
one
for
those
people
read
liberals
who
would
like
to
have
concentrated
power
to
use
the
government
to
force
people
to
do
good
a
difficulttodefine
word
and
one
that
it
is
difficult
to
reach
a
consensus
on
it
is
also
a
frustrating
structure
for
those
who
want
to
use
the
government
to
dictate
personal
behavior
read
biggovernment
conservatives
i
personally
would
rather
see
those
types
of
people
frustrated
than
the
incredible
erosion
of
liberty
both
civil
and
economic
that
is
going
on
now
this
is
imho
a
good
government
stucture
for
those
who
see
the
role
of
government
as
the
protection
of
individual
liberties
while
still
recognizing
that
individuals
need
to
have
some
influence
in
the
type
of
community
that
they
live
in
a
free
market
works
on
government
not
just
economics
succesful

propogate
unsuccessful
ideas
die
what
is
your
definition
of
a
successful
idea
or
a
successful
government
one
which
maintains
peace
liberty
and
the
opportunity
for
happiness
for
its
people
while
working
within
the
realities
of
human
nature
you
do
bring
up
the
point
intentional
or
not
that
a
lasting
idea
is
by
no
means
necessarily
a
successful
idea
i
believe
that
fractal
federalism
would
at
least
bring
many
ideas
to
light
and
the
people
would
have
the
opportunity
to
democratically
choose
between
good
ideas
and
bad
ideas
if
the
docialists
er
i
mean
democrats
are
right
and
government
activism
fosters
a
prosperous
people
they
will
have
a
plethora
of
local
opportunities
to
check
their
thesis
if
libertopia
is
possible
it
will
arise
if
a
balanced
conservative
republic
is
democratically
received
as
the
best
level
of
government
activity
it
will
become
clear
to
the
people
that
it
is
best
as
far
as
set
the
moral
tone
is
concerned
if
a
community
does
not
collectively
want
to
put
up
with
prostitution
going
on
in
front
of
their
kids
why
should
they
have
to
if
a
community
does
not
want
to
see
proliferation
of
drugs
among
their
kids
why
should
they
have
to
for
the
same
reason
that
they
have
to
put
up
with
a
church
operating
right
out
in
the
open
where
their
kids
can
see
it
and
with
the
owner
of
the
house
across
the
street
flying
an
american
flag
right
out
there
in
the
open
every
day
in
front
of
their
kids
its
called
freedom
if
they
dont
like
the
ideas
to
which
their
kids
are
exposed
they
can
try
to
educate
and
persuade
their
kids
as
to
why
the
things
that
theyre
seeing
other
people
doing
are
wrong
or
bad
right
and
people
would
not
rescind
any
freedoms
read
empower
the
government
except
through
the
amendment
process
that
is
how
the
federal
government
is
supposed
to
work
now
but
the
supreme
soviet
er
i
mean
the
supreme
court
put
a
stop
to
that
republican
government
nonsense
in
my
hypothetical
government
if
there
were
a
constitutional
provision
empowering
the
government
to
regulate
churches
the
government
whatever
level
we
are
talking
about
could
indeed
ban
churches
the
constitutional
provision
would
be
invalid
if
a
higher
level
had
a
constitutional
provision
protecting
free
exercise
of
religion
the
uppermost
constitution
is
still
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
i
find
it
interesting
that
you
applaud
the
idea
of
freemarket
competition
among
various
ideas
and
yet
support
the
right
of
he
majority
in
a
community
to
suppress
ideas
which
they
dont
like
it
is
a
matter
of
individuals
being
able
to
control
their
own
associations
and
environment
not
a
matter
of
suppression
of
ideas
one
dilemma
of
the
human
condition
is
that
individuals
need
liberty
and
they
also
need
to
have
some
control
over
their
environment
in
my
fractal
federalism
government
certain
rights
are
protected
by
the
constitutions
other
rights
are
protected
simply
because
the
government
has
not
been
empowered
to
infringe
upon
them
when
a
consensus
is
reached
that
the
government
should
have
a
certain
power
then
freedom
is
infringed
upon
this
cannot
be
avoided
murder
statutes
infringe
upon
freedom
but
i
think
that
the
consensus
of
the
american
people
is
that
murder
statutes
are
a
good
idea
i
am
sure
that
many
parents
believe
that
they
have
a
right
to
control
the
environment
that
their
children
live
in
people
feel
that
they
have
a
right
to
sleep
peacefully
at
night
thus
there
are
noise
ordinances
there
are
zoning
laws
that
keep
businesses
from
overrunning
residential
neighborhoods
i
do
not
view
these
as
bad
things
certainly
some
individual
instances
are
bad
but
the
concept
is
not
necessarily
bad
i
view
them
as
the
people
in
a
community
having
some
control
over
the
type
of
community
that
they
live
in
i
see
the
alternative
as
near
anarchy
like
i
said
in
another
post
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
scenario
where
an
individual
can
do
something
truly
autonomously
with
absolutely
zero
effect
on
anyone
else
then
no
individual
or
government
has
the
right
to
restrict
that
activity
there
are
simply
not
very
many
behaviors
that
fit
into
the
category
of
the
truly
autonomous
so
the
whole
thing
becomes
an
issue
of
one
individual
or
group
having
power
over
another
individual
or
group
i
think
that
the
fractal
federalism
approach
is
a
sound
if
not
ideal
approach
to
limiting
this
restrictive
power
the
libertarian
scenario
degenerates
to
might
makes
right
and
the
system
we
have
right
now
is
one
of
lawyers
abusing
natural
rights
philosophy
to
decide
what
powers
the
government
should
have
by
subverting
the
democratic
process
though
the
supreme
court
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tries
to
deny
the
fundamental
dilemma
of
democratic
government
the
people
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
in
their
community
yet
individuals
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselves
this
is
a
serious
dilemma
precisely
because
there
is
not
much
that
takes
place
in
a
vacuum
oddly
enough
if
what
you
say
is
taken
literally
there
is
little
or
no
conflict
the
people
do
indeed
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
where
voice
equals
persuasive
speech
in
their
communities
its
only
when
they
somehow
get
the
idea
into
their
heads
that
they
also
have
a
right
to
dictate
behavior
in
their
communities
that
the
trouble
begins
i
think
i
answered
this
above
already
but
let
me
expand
a
little
more
with
an
example
if
i
stand
naked
in
front
of
your
house
and
masturbate
in
front
of
your
children
while
they
play
in
your
libertarian
small
l
scenario
the
only
recourse
you
have
is
to
yell
at
me
autonomous
is
a
value
judgement
of
the
time
it
is
not
a
scientific
reality
with
a
clear
definition
exactly
who
would
you
empower
to
make
that
value
judgement
stuff
deleted
certainly
not
the
only
cause
mike
but
people
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voice
in
what
goes
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deny
this
is
to
create
another
concentrated
centralized
power
to
keep
the
locality
from
abusing
its
power
in
essence
using
a
pit
bull
to
keep
a
toy
poodle
from
biting
your
leg
chances
are
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
on
you
some
day
and
you
have
much
less
defense
against
it
than
you
do
against
the
toy
poodle
the
argument
here
appears
to
be
that
tyranny
of
the
individual
by
the
local
majority
is
superior
to
having
the
federal
government
have
and
exercise
the
power
to
protect
the
individual
from
his
neighbors
because
that
federal
government
will
eventually
and
inevitably
become
corrupt
and
use
its
power
to
tyrannize
everyone
okay
theres
a
lot
of
truth
in
that
certainly
were
seeing
something
like
that
happening
in
the
united
states
today
though
its
unclear
that
he
progression
here
matches
the
model
since
our
beloved
and
benign
federal
government
hasnt
evershown
much
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
of
protecting
any
individuals
lots
of
people
are
long
on
complaints
and
short
on
practical
solutions
although
i
am
pessimistic
that
my
idea
will
ever
bear
fruit
i
am
at
least
trying
to
be
long
on
solutions
also
i
am
truly
interested
if
you
have
any
improvements
to
make
on
my
ideas
i
call
them
my
ideas
but
they
all
come
from
an
average
guy
reading
of
the
us
constitution
without
benefit
of
the
indoctrination
of
constitutional
law
academia
but
i
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
your
solution
is
at
least
just
as
bad
trading
the
yoke
of
federal
tyranny
for
the
yoke
of
local
tyranny
doesnt
cheer
me
up
much
i
think
id
prefer
to
put
my
faith
in
a
larger
government
that
at
least
might
protect
the
individual
from
time
to
time
rather
than
place
it
in
local
mob
rule
admittedly
its
the
lesser
of
two
evils
and
its
not
less
by
very
much
and
theyre
both
pretty
damn
evil
sorry
the
confusion
was
my
fault
when
i
said
that
fractal
federalism
resembles
the
us
constitution
i
meant
it
and
thought
it
was
pretty
clear
i
should
have
more
clearly
explained
that
the
ultimate
derivation
of
government
power
is
from
the
consensus
of
the
people
although
not
the
consent
of
every
individual
a
practical
observation
not
a
moral
judgement
it
is
certainly
better
than
having
all
government
power
derive
from
nine
lawyers
which
is
the
situation
we
have
now
that
is
why
i
think
the
supreme
court
should
be
a
jury
court
with
a
different
jury
for
each
case
it
is
certainly
not
perfect
no
philosophy
of
government
is
but
do
you
still
find
it
a
repugnant
idea
if
so
what
is
your
solution
ideally
everyone
would
leave
everyone
else
alone
and
no
government
coercive
power
of
any
kind
would
be
necessary
this
will
never
work
because
people
are
different
and
by
their
nature
they
will
always
want
to
force
their
views
on
others
if
this
were
not
the
case
nobody
would
try
to
force
their
view
that
murder
is
wrong
on
anyone
else
this
is
true
the
question
is
what
we
you
going
to
do
about
it
your
proposed
solution
seems
to
actually
encourage
these
bozos
to
lord
it
over
their
victims
i
think
that
you
misunderstood
the
structure
of
the
form
of
government
i
advocate
and
it
was
my
fault
for
not
being
more
clear
oh
and
by
the
way
liborgalism
thinking
is
irrelevant
integrity
is
irrelevant
free
speech
is
irrelevant
private
property
is
irrelevant
personal
responsibility
is
irrelevant
conservativism
is
futile

he

they
should
have
tried

break
down
the

loyalty
to
koresh
through

koreshs
whole
theology
was
based
on
an
approaching
confrontation
with
the
forces
of
evil
in
the
world
and
a
seige
mentality
based
on
this
the
feds
played
into
his
hands
perfectly
by
surrounding
the

with
tanks
and
playing
loud
rock
music
and
glaring
lights
at

they
strongly
reinforced
koreshs
message
that
the

was
evil

said
instead
they
should
have
set
up
a

acted

recently
explaining
this
they
pumped
the

into
the

from
outside
via
some

rather
than

the

they

that
sticks

kind

these

since

none

this
whole

was
a

i
hope
it

thoroughly

that

as
youre
no

aware
phill
there
are
probably
five
or
six
different
mutually
contradictory
versions
of
the
events
in
waco
on
feb
all
of
which
are
from
reputable
news
sources
ranging
the
the
associated
press
to
time
to
newsweek
some
of
the
earliest
reports
issued
by
the
ap
were
not
at
all
flattering
the
to
batf
and
produced
some
question
as
to
who
fired
first
now
for
all
i
know
you
were
there
to
witness
it
but
i
kind
of
doubt
that
any
government
that
allows
tinpot
dictators
to
set
up
shop
and
declare
a
private
state
has
drifted
into
anarchy
there
are
laws
to
control
the
ownership
of
guns
and
the
batf
had
good
reason
to
beleive
that
they
were
being
violated
they
set
out
to
obtain
a
legal
warrant
and
attempted
to
serve
it
only
to
be
met
with
gunfire
when
they
rang
the
doorbell
the
batf
in
a
letter
theyve
been
sending
out
to
people
says
both
that
they
were
ambushed
because
they
lost
the
element
of
surprise
and
that
they
went
up
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
had
it
slammed
in
their
faces
it
strikes
me
as
kind
of
strange
to
rely
on
surprise
to
serve
a
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
there
are
at
least
questions
that
need
to
be
answered
the
paranoid
assertion
that
the
batf
fired
first
in
an
unprovoked
assault
assumes
that
the
batf
were
on
a
death
wish
this
paranoid
assertation
was
made
by
witnesses
to
the
original
assault
who
stated
that
the
batf
initiated
hostilities
by
throwing
concussion
grenades
and
reported
by
the
associated
press
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
phill
the
batf
were
in
a
firefight
with
the

for
fortyfive
minutes
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
they
were

peaceful
citizens
they
wouldnt
have
shown
up
in

would

handguns

the

this

rationalisation
it

for

simply
dismiss

incompetent
that
would
require

to

themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a

conspiracy
theory
whereby
the

decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort

scare
to
alow

through

must
object
to
the
characterization
of
those
opposed
to

handling
of
the
waco

as
gun
supporters
your
argument
tries
to
paint
the
batf

as
rightwing
gun
nuts
and
just
mixes
up
two
issues
i
am
one
of
the
batffbi
critics
and
yet
i
am
a
liberal
and
just
as
antigun
as
you
are
i
just
happen
to
believe
that
everyone
has
civil
rights
even
religious
crazies
theyre
all
human
beings
not
some
nest
of
wasps
that
youre
trying
to
exterminate
the
batf
created
the
crisis
situation
by
the
way
they
handled
the
original
raid
it
was
well
known
that
koresh
regularly
went
jogging
outside
his
property
he
could
have
been
served
with
a
search
warrant
then
he
could
have
been
arrested
if
he
had
refused
to
comply
instead
officers
armed
with
grenades
invaded
the
property
this
escalated
into
a
shooting
war
with
tragic
deaths
on
both
sides
those
were
the
first
two
mistakes
the
bad
judgment
of
asking
for
a
noknock
warrant
and
the
bad
and
probably
illegal
way
the
alreadyunwise
warrant
was
served
at
this
point
the
situation
escalated
to
where
it
was
described
as
an
armed
standoff
and
a
hostage
crisis
thats
when
the
government
started
covering
their
traces
sealing
the
warrant
revising
their
reported
history
of
the
incident
etc
things
were
already
building
up
to
disaster
now
the
government
could
have
simply
closed
the
supply
routes
and
waited
but
according
to
janet
reno
that
option
had
never
been
seriously
considered
so
supposedly
because
the
agents
were
frustrated
and
fatigued
and
because
there
supposedly
were
no
backups
they
felt
they
had
to
go
in
yes
the
govt
handled
it
in
the
rambo
hollywood
type
style
with
extreeme
machismo
perhaps
thats
not
the
way
to
handle
it
it
is
a
completely
different
thing
to
start
asserting
as
many
have
done
that
the
government
is
primarily
to
blame
the
comparisons
with
the
nazis
in
particular
are
purely
gratuitous
since
you
have
provided
a
constructive
opinion
on
the
issue
your
post
desreves
to
be
taken
seriously
peter
nelson
also
made
some
very
good
points
about
how
a
low
key
approach
might
have
been
more
effective
the
point
is
though
that
you
learn
through
mistakes
the
govt
played
the
wrong
card
and
lost
thats
not
a
big
deal
they
had
had
four
guys
murdered
at
the
begining
and
maybee
they
just
were
not
prepared
for
wuite
this
situation
who
could
be
if
the
same
thing
were
to
happen
all
over
again
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
castigate
the
govt
if
they
used
the
same
tactics
and
failed
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
i
cant
say
that
i
would
not
have
made
the
same
mistake
maybee
i
wouldnt
because
i
dont
as
a
rule
go
in
for
a
confrontational
situation
if
i
can
avoid
it
maybee
i
would
because
with
all
those
press
about
its
very
difficult
not
to
try
the
macho
stuff
the
fbi
had
information
from
within
the
compound
we
had
no
access
to
they
may
have
calculated
that
the
bd
followers
resolve
was
cracking
based
on
their
listening
devices
within
the
compound
they
knew
that
koresh
had
chickened
out
of
one
suicide
attempt
this
may
have
been
the
reason
why
they
considered
that
fear
might
have
been
a
weapon
for
breaking
his
resolve
again
in
panama
they
had
used
the
heavy
rock
music
to
great
effect
during
bushs
invasion
funny
that
few
of
the
koresh
supporters
and
appologists
complain
much
about
the
death
of
several
thousand
pananmanian
civilians
while
the
us
govt
attempted
to
arrest
their
former
ally
and
please
lets
not
turn
this
into
a
progun

antigun
discussion
antigun
people
do
not
believe
that
gunowners
deserve
to
get
frontally
assaulted
by
armed
government
agents
and
koreshs
civil
rights
exist
whether
his
guns
were
legal
illegal
illegalbutshouldhavebeenlegal
or
whatever
koresh
negated
his
civil
rights
the
minute
his
followers
fired
on
the
police
helicopter
no
matter
whether
the
warrant
was
or
was
not
technically
valid
the
guys
who
were
carrying
it
out
thought
that
it
was
thus
the
assault
on
them
was
completely
inexcusable
no
matter
what
rationalisation
people
might
wish
to
employ
of
course
we
have
to
consider
the
guns
issue
that
is
the

you

in

i
had

pulled

had

who
were

i
was
beaten
up
repeatedly
by
those
that
couldnt
accept
me
as
different
and
dont
let
the
teachers
off
the
hook
either
on
many
many
occasions
there
were
teachers
that
either
resented
me
or
were
too
scared
out

wits
by
the
bullies
to
even
stop
the
people
who
attacked
me

they
would
just
watch
quietly
all

we

this

you

there
was

im

you
missed

in

i
would

you

you

you
should
follow
your

the
preamble
to
the

does
read
as
you
have
quoted
but
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a
binding
part
of
the
constitution
and
carries
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortured
paragraph
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
passages
in
the

witness
the

like
yourself
who
think
those
vague
flowery

are

do
you
really
believe

a

only
has
to
give
lip
service
to
promoting
the
general
welfare
to
be
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of

of

i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general

in
article
i

i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions
right
james

this
isnt

may
argue
that
line

from

view
of

what
the

did
was

wrong

if

oh

a

then
one
evening
not

in

country
a
man
a
parolee
a
convicted
known
violent
crimminal
lead
police
on
high
speed
chase
after
breaking

he
decided
that

had
no

enforce
the
law
and
assualted
two
of
while
attempting
to
resist
arrest
when
police
use
metal
sticks
to
force
him
into
submission
we
heard
all
the
reason
why
certain
people
in
this
country
have
and
excuse
when
they
refuse
to
obey
the
law
how
this
was
a
perfect
example
of
police
oppression
how
all
the
police
had
to
do
was
behave
a
certain
way
and
all
would
have
been
finei
how
nothing
the
victim
did
could
have
possibly
warranted
the
response
some
blows
with
a
few
sticks
he
got
from
the
authorities
funny
how
when
its
bloodbath
billy
or
his

calling
the

a
group
of
people
who
were

no

were

know
to
have
broken
any
law
who
asked
only
that
they
be
left
alone
to
practice
their
religion
as
they
fit
how
it
is
now
that
the
government
is
justified
in
assualting
those
people
with
heavily
armed
commandos
simply
because
the
gun
grabbers
in
dc
thought
these
people
had
more
guns
thay
they
thought
they
should
have
now
when
its
the
clinton
administration
that
has
the
blood
of
dozens
on
its
hand
aaaall
of
a
sudden
its
the
people
who
refused
to
have
their
civil
rights
violated
its
their
fault
those
evil
fanatics
provoked
it

is
it

of
the

that
a

piece

peter
nelson
posted
a
very
eloquent
response
to
this
point
in
talkpoliticsmisc
so
i
need
not
consume
more
bandwidth
here
the
problem
with
the
egalitarian
view
is
that
it
tries
to
deny
the
fundamental
dilemma
of
democratic
government
the
people
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
voice
in
their
community
yet
individuals
have
the
right
to
be
left
to
themselves
this
is
a
serious
dilemma
precisely
because
there
is
not
much
that
takes
place
in
a
vacuum
you
are
seriously
misusing
the
word
egalitarian
you
should
look
the
word
up
before
you
use
it
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
equal
justice
under
the
law
and
egalitarianism
what
i
meant
if
it
was
not
clear
was
the
intersection
set
of
liberal
and
libertarian
philosophies
of
natural
rights
and
how
the
government
and
constitutional
interpretation
in
particular
fits
into
that
philosophy
this
philosophy
engages
in
the
very
serious
practical
error
of
endowing
the
nine
lawyers
on
the
supreme
court
with
an
almost
totalitarian
authority
completely
outside
of
the
consent
or
consensus
of
the
people
this
is
why
supreme
court
nominations
are
such
amazing
political
fistfights
these
days
because
he
who
controls
the
court
rules
the
country
the
people
on
the
court
may
well
be
trying
to
do
the
best
job
they
can
but
they
are
at
best
a
benevolent
oligarch
even
if
you
approve
of
every
supreme
court
decision
ever
eventually
an
oligarch
will
arise
that
will
decimate
that
which
you
hold
dear
try
supreme
court
cases
by
jury
and
the
problem
would
be
mitigated
a
great
deal
those
who
would
create
broad
nonenumerated
government
powers
at
any
level
as
in
european
parlamentary
democracies
and
the
current
defacto
standard
in
the
us
have
essentially
engaged
in
the
same
fundamental
mistake
except
that
it
is
some
different
body
that
has
the
totalitarian
virtually
unchecked
except
by
plurality
election
death
or
retirement
government
power
and
why
should
your
community
be
allowed
to
stop
my
activities
when
im
not
picking
your
pocket
or
defrauding
you
just
because
you
dont
like
it
because
you
find
it
morally
repugnant
this
is
like
asking
why
the
wind
blows
unless
you
can
prove
that
the
fact
of
your
engaging
in
certain
activities
has
absolutely
no
effect
whatsoever
on
any
other
human
being
who
has
not
consented
to
your
engagement
in
those
activities
very
few
human
activities
indeed
fit
into
this
category
even
for
those
few
that
do
who
would
you
empower
to
make
the
judgement
of
what
is
and
is
not
a
fully
autonomous
activity
who
defines
picking
my
pocket
and
defrauding
are
economic
assets
a
persons
only
assets
or
are
peace
of
mind
stability
confidence
in
a
childs
emotional
environment
security
and
many
other
things
not
also
a
part
of
a
persons
assets
what
gives
you
the
right
to
create
a
moral
environment
that
a
parent
strongly
objects
to
what
gives
you
the
right
to
create
an
environment
of
social
unrest
and
instability
if
you
say
that
what
you
do
does
not
have
those
effects
by
what
authority
do
you
say
that
who
is
empowered
to
make
these
value
judgements
how
would
you
feel
if
i
got
a
gang
together
and
found
xtianity
or
insert
your
favorite
cause
here
morally
repugnant
and
passed
laws
to
outlaw
its
free
exercise
all
at
a
local
level
since
that
seems
to
be
aok
with
you
if
the
federal
constitution
explicitly
prohibited
you
from
doing
so
the
federal
government
would
prevent
you
from
doing
so
if
it
did
not
and
you
could
muster
enough
local
support
to
pass
an
amendment
to
the
local
constitution
by
say
a
majority
empowering
the
local
government
to
do
so
then
i
would
have
to
vote
with
my
feet
and
move
to
a
neighborhood
more
friendly
to
my
own
system
of
values
this
is
not
an
ideal
situation
but
it
is
far
better
than
the
mess
we
are
mired
in
right
now
as
to
the
gang
of
pitchfork
and
torch
wielding
friends
there
are
very
few
restrictive
local
laws
that
i
personally
would
advocate
or
vote
for
since
i
am
of
the
view
that
exercising
government
power
over
your
neighbors
should
be
done
with
extreme
care
and
only
when
absolutely
necessary
but
i
do
believe
in
protecting
children
from
victimization
by
people
who
have
callous
disregard
for
the
effects
they
have
on
others
i
would
certainly
leave
a
wellbehaved
massage
parlor
alone
so
long
as
it
had
no
detrimental
effects
on
the
neighborhood
you
just
dont
get
it
the
debate
is
not
whether
you
or
a
communitity
would
or
would
not
vote
away
my
rights
it
is
the
propriety
of
whether
that
should
even
be
an
option
when
you
define
rights
very
broadly
there
is
no
practical
choice
about
whether
people
will
or
will
not
infringe
upon
your
rights
since
these
rights
overlap
even
when
rights
are
defined
very
narrowly
the
government
has
been
empowered
to
prevent
others
from
infringing
on
your
rights
the
fundamental
question
is
by
whose
authority
is
that
power
created
if
you
support
the
current
situation
with
a
natural
rights
supreme
court
rather
than
an
original
understanding
supreme
court
or
even
better
supreme
court
by
jury
you
are
consenting
to
having
nine
lawyers
in
washington
dc
create
those
powers
out
of
the
air
in
my
fractal
federalism
scenario
it
is
a
broad
consensus
of
the
people
ie
the
amendment
process
that
creates
those
powers
certainly
not
the
only
cause
mike
but
people
in
a
local
neighborhood
should
have
a
voice
in
what
goes
on
in
that
neighborhood
to
deny
this
is
to
create
another
concentrated
centralized
power
to
keep
the
locality
from
abusing
its
power
you
mean
that
horrific
centralized
power
the
individual
no
i
mean
the
federal
government
that
comes
trucking
in
with
guns
to
tell
the
locals
how
to
run
their
neighborhood
waco
tx
is
a
nice
example
in
essence
using
a
pit
bull
to
keep
a
toy
poodle
from
biting
your
leg
chances
are
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
on
you
some
day
and
you
have
much
less
defense
against
it
than
you
do
against
the
toy
poodle
ideally
everyone
would
leave
everyone
else
alone
and
no
government
coercive
power
of
any
kind
would
be
necessary
this
will
never
work
because
people
are
different
and
by
their
nature
they
will
always
want
to
force
their
views
on
others
if
this
were
not
the
case
nobody
would
try
to
force
their
view
that
murder
is
wrong
on
anyone
else
fine
when
they
force
their
views
on
others
prosecute
them
until
then
leave
them
alone
this
is
such
a
simple
concept
how
do
you
feel
about
speech
codes
hate
speech
certainly
could
be
considered
an
indication
that
the
pit
bull
is
going
to
turn
some
day
should
the
community
be
allowed
to
limit
it
too
if
not
why
not
if
you
create
a
community
where
public
masturbation
is
permitted
in
the
cause
of
personal
autonomy
have
you
done
anything
different
what
precisely
are
these
autonomous
activities
you
are
referring
to
if
you
list
them
perhaps
we
can
get
enough
people
to
agree
that
they
are
truly
autonomous
and
pass
a
constitutional
amendment
protecting
them
and
how
do
you
feel
about
david
koresh
did
he
deserve
it
should
the
batf
or
a
local
version
of
same
be
allowed
to
toss
him
in
jail
just
because
they
think
hes
off
his
rocker
the
koresh
incident
appears
to
be
a
horrendous
abuse
of
government
power
power
possibly
illegitimately
obtained
through
a
means
i
would
abolish
the
constitutionality
of
noknock
warrants
seems
very
dubious
to
me
not
to
mention
the
mere
existence
of
batf
and
the
governments
propensity
to
ignore
the
word
infringe
in
the

this
power
is
upheld
by
the

with
its
incredible
concentration
of
power
in
the
hands
of
nine
people
that
has
upheld
much
socalled
civil

read
affirmative

legislation
despite
the
fourteenth

who
said
anything
about
the
public
till
get
rid
of
it
and
get

my

i
agree
about
getting
rid
of
the

till
are
you
still
sure
you
dont
want
to
come
over
for
coffee
you
might
not
especially
like

and
i
might
not
especially
like
yours
but
at
least
we
can
agree
to
let
each
other
live
the
kind
of
life
we
want
to
at
the
point
you
get
rid
of
the
public
till
you
lose
all
credibility
as
to
why
you
should
have

i
heard
about
a
guy
in
alberta
who
came
down
with
some
rare
eye
disease
that
he
had
to
take
repeated
trips
to
seattle
to
get
treated
well
what
american
private
insurance
plans
cover
travel
expenses
well
it
wasnt
just
the
travel
expenses
it
was
the
whole
treatment
when
you
buy
insurance
where
you
live
it
is
based
on
the
local
rates
tourists
coming
from
say
utah
will
find
that
there
is
a
difference
in
what
their
insurance
will
cover
fob
provo
and
what
they
get
stuck
with
at
lenox
hill
or
mount
sinai
if
they
fall
ill
in
the
big
apple
but
to
what
extent
does
it
affect
the
system
and
why
is
an
urgent
care
list
necessary
in
the
first
place
its
worth
thinking
about
its
regular
practice
in
a
hospital
to
figure
out
who
needs
to
get
at
what
facilities
dont
americans
have
to
arrange
in
advance
for
operations
too
i
think
that
there
are
two
standards
being
applied
here
and
that
canada
cant
give
beverly
hillsstyle
treatment
to
everybody
its
not
a
big
brother
list
its
more
like
calling
around
town
for
a
table
for
dinner
but
americans
need
far
less
advance
time
to
book
operations
it
would
depend
on
where
you
live
downtown
toronto
or
mile
british
columbia
just
like
cheyenne
wy
vs
boston
ma
again
geography
rears
its
ugly
head
since
our
health
care
providers
are
private
they
depend
on
an
adequate
market
size
in
order
to
sustain
enough
business
since
our
health
care
professionals
have
equivalent
takehome
pay
to
their
american
cousins
its
not
that
theyre
being
paid
too
little
to
provide
services
whether
canadians
would
be
thrilled
at
the
prospect
of
their
own
health
services
catering
toward
americans
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
than
they
do
is
another
issue
entirely
it
must
be
noted
that
they
said
they
were
doing
it
partly
because
their
grants
from
the
province
were
getting
smaller
if
those
grants
are
so
insubstantial
why
the
need
to
attract
foreigners
to
make
up
the
difference
you
answered
the
question
yourself
private
nonprofit
foundations
have
to
make
money
somehow
and
i
think
that
its
about
time
that
they
acted
like
the
private
hospitals
that
they
are
personally
im
fed
up
with
canadian
socialists
trying
to
tell
everyone
that
their
health
care
is
free
when
we
are
actually
buying
insurance
thats
one
at
you
bob
rae
true
but
i
was
thinkingdoescan
anybody
compete
with
the
provinces
to
offer
basic
health
coverage
i
remember
reading
that
that
sort
of
private
health
insurance
is
actually
illegal
in
canada
i
have
only
hear
americans
say
that
its
illegal
but
i
could
be
wrong
just
have
never
heard
it
from
a
canadian
source
our
private
insurance
has
recently
balked
in
quebec
when
the
liberals
proposed
privatizing
some
aspects
of
routine
care
also
our
insurance
was
put
in
place
when
no
ndp
labour
governments
were
in
power
in
any
province
to
derail
the
effort
cos
they
wanted
real
socialized
medicine
youre
not
buying
insurance
so
much
as
being
coerced
into
one
insurance
plan
no
it
is
optional
as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept
it
there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in
particular
that
ask
for
exemptions
and
one
email
from
a
christian
scientist
in
edmonton
verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
interesting
side
notehave
any
new
insurance
companies
started
upfrom
scratchsince
medicare
became
standard
in
canada
i
actually
have
doubts
that
any
new
ones
have
emerged
since
ww
i
no
scratch
that
there
are
a
few
in
western
canada
and
quite
a
few
in
quebec
as
part
of
the
quebec
miracle
out
with
the
nationalism
in
with
the
french
capitalism
la

if

youd
see
it
as
the
welllit
one
with
doubleturrets
at
the
top
as
for
ontario
which
still
dominates
and
anchors
business
up
north
canada
is
a
very
oldmoney
kind
of
place
and
the
free
trade
agreement
saw
a
lot
of
odd
alliances
labour
unions
and
establishment
old
money
who
wanted
to
preserve
their
traditional
monopolies
on
one
side
and
entrepreneurs
and
internationally
oriented
businesses
and
professionals
on
the
other
the
final
trudeau
administration
and
the
first
mulroney
government
had
a
high
percentage
of
nouveaux
riches
who
knew
what
it
was
like
to
make
your
own
money
and
that
motivated
the
mcdonald
commission
under
trudeau
which
set
up
brians
initiative
macaroni
was
against
free
trade
til
he
did
a
head
count
of
his
caucus
after
the
election
its
not
really
insurance
if
you
dont
have
alternatives
well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
btw
there
are
always
pacifists
in
the
news
arguing
about
their
portion
of
taxes
but
never
people
arguing
over
health
insurance
alternatives
and
were
talking
about
a
press
that
is
hostile
to
whomever
is
in
government
regardless
of
party
one
of
their
few
redeeming
characteristics
it
seems
also
in
the
april
globe
and
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
the
director
of
trauma
services
at
st
michaels
hospital
in
toronto
responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that
canada
rationed
vital
services
the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his
name
said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital
services
as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the
health
insurance
plan
in
fairness
he
did
say
that
both
the
us
and
canadian
systems
are
in
the
same
situation
the
only
way
to
hit
at
the
canadian
system
is
transient
periods
of
high
demand
which
is
more
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopolys
tight
fist
on
the
licencing
an
obvious
difference
is
that
in
such
a
transient
period
the
rationing
is
of
the
nature
of
a
mob
battling
over
cabbage
patch
dollstm
as
weve
seen
recently
as
opposed
by
rationing
by
ability
to
pay
but
the
former
is
a
transient
situation
and
if
a
large
body
of
insured
patients
were
to
deluge
the
california
health
infrastructure
the
same
would
result
rationing
among
the
insured
population
with
smaller
markets
there
is
much
less
flexibility
when
dealing
with
our
insured
population
than
california
which
by
the
way
has
more
people
than
canada
in
a
much
more
dense
area
so
he
is
correct
in
that
the
resources
are
fixed
for
a
particular
time
window
or
as
a
function
of
the
doctors
monopoly
licencing
according
to
the
market
steady
state
in
either
case
as
for
being
refused
treatment
the
government
of
the
day
would
be
shredded
to
tatters
if
something
like
that
were
to
happen
canadians
can
be
geographically
bad
too
not
realizing
that
their
health
care
is
private
while
only
their
insurance
isnt
too
many
people
have
bought
into
socialist
trype
that
we
have
socialized
medicine
i
know
i
know
the
monopoly
power
of
canadian
doctors
often
leads
them
to
overstate
the
problems
with
the
system
in
order
to
get
more
money
from
the
government
another
case
of
businessmen
once
scratched
becoming
socialists
right
as
ive
pointed
out
above
but
hasnt
that
just
shifted
the
locus
of
the
problem
from
one
place
to
the
other
it
hasnt
really
solved
it
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
people
too
often
tend
to
put
prescription
cold
medicine
on
their
insurance
when
they
really
dont
need
to
thats
why
ive
argued
for
deductible
and
copayments
rather
than
education
which
is
what
most
canadian
fiscal
conservatives
are
arguing
for
the
leftists
ah
just
let
em
spend
yeah
right
also
note
that
only
a
few
provinces
cover
prescriptions
under
some
high
dollar
threshold
in
most
its
your
private
insurance
that
covers
it
just
like
in
the
us
still
it
all
adds
up
in
the
oecd
measures
in
fact
buffalo
may
be
the
only
place
in
the
us
where
people
get
don
cherry
jokes
we
get
the
sabres
feed
as
a
replacement
game
on
espn
tonight
the
devils
local
metro
ny
coverage
supplants
the
main
espn
game
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
tory
spending
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
politics
yeah
its
a
sad
story
and
saskatchewan
tory
leader
grant
devine
has
been
on
a
nonstop
pr
campaign
to
save
his
sorry
butt
the
sask
ndp
have
taken
a
neoconservative
turn
like
hawke
gonzalez
and
mitterand
did
has
anybody
considered
following
singapores
example
and
going
to
a
system
where
the
company
and
the
state
buys
basic
and
catastrophic
coverage
for
everybody
and
then
you
also
have
an
ira
sort
of
thing
to
which
you
and
your
employer
can
can
contribute
for
medical
expenses
only
it
would
tend
to
discourage
you
from
overusing
it
the
medical
ira
would
have
limited
use
as
youd
need
a
lower
catastrophic
threshold
else
thered
still
be
a
drain
on
the
public
purse
if
someone
exhausts
their
ira
also
singapore
has
a
much
more
autocratic
mentality
which
has
seaped
down
into
its
masses
if
singaporeans
that
ive
met
are
any
indication
i
dont
mean
any
disprespect
here
where
theyd
let
you
just
die
one
of
the
good
things
about
being
the
last
country
to
create
a
national
health
care
system
should
we
decide
to
is
that
we
have
everybody
elses
mistakes
to
learn
from
thats
true
the
question
is
how
much
leeway
is
there
between
the
us
approach
and
the
secondmost
capitalist
approaches
of
canada
france
and
germany
seriously
there
are
few
areas
that
have
sufficient
population
for
a
twomoretiered
system
like
what
the
french
have
a
health
policy
prof
dg
shea
has
cited
studies
in
the
nejm
that
indicate
having
a
population
of
is
necessary
for
adequate
competition
and
in
canada
there
are
only
four
cities
west
of
the
great
lakes
with
that
population
or
larger
but
there
are
many
cities
in
the
us
with
that
kind
of
population
yes
many
and
pretty
close
to
a
lot
of
smaller
towns
or
not
too
far
from
a
bigger
town
just
take
a
look
at
a
detailed
atlas
or
better
take
a
flight
from
pittsburgh
or
rochester
to
toronto
my
first
time
across
lake
ontario
to
nyc
i
was
amazed
by
the
increase
in
density
and
the
toronto
region
is
the
densest
in
all
of
canada
there
was
one
about
a
group
of
doctors
in
calgary
who
have
opened
canadas
first
usstyle
mri
clinic
as
an
alternative
to
the
provincially
owned
one
its
about
time
ive
ragged
on
my
own
doctor
friends
as
to
why
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
private
practices
in
the
end
its
their
money
but
they
choose
to
spend
it
on
americas
cup
pipedreams
and
thats
none
of
my
business
as
for
provincially
owned
for
sure
its
against
the
law
in
canada
for
governments
to
be
directly
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care
except
in
the
military
or
native
reser
vations
what
that
term
actually
means
is
that
the
facility
gets
by
on
public
grants
to
meet
shortfall
from
lack
of
use
no
kidding
medical
practice
itself
is
much
more
conservative
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkships
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicine
but
his
boat
comes
first
there
were
some
people
expressing
concern
that
it
was
the
first
wedge
of
twotiered
health
care
and
that
it
might
violate
the
canada
health
act
no
its
probably
socialist
whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
since
the
french
and
germans
have
become
more
entrepreneurial
and
less
laidback
without
sacrificing
their
culture
and
values
then
canadians
can
do
the
same
as
ive
pointed
out
above
the
law
states
that
it
is
illegal
for
the
government
to
provide
any
health
services
except
for
the
military
and
natives
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying

mri

both
that

they
lost
the
element

and
that
they
went
up
and
knocked
on
the

and
had
it
slammed
in
their
faces
it
strikes
me
as
kind
of
strange
to
rely
on
surprise
to
serve
a
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
presumably
the
bd
did
not
mount
a
continuous
state
of
alert
with
gunmen
ready
to
fire
on
people
who
casually
walked
up
to
ring
the

lets
try
that
again
why
was
the
batf
concerned
about
surprise
when
they
intended
to
serve
the
warrant
by
knocking
on
the
door
the
batf
appears
to
be
inconsistant
in
their
own
description
of
events
and
in
any
case
how
does
one
mount
an
ambush
if
one
isnt
on
alert
had
they
expected
the
bd
to
be
anything
other
than
peacefull
citizens
who
would
accept
a
search
authorized
by
a
court
they
would
have
turned
up
in
a
tank
and
broken
the
door
down
on
day
one
phill
the
batf
were
in
a
firefight
with
the
bd
for
fortyfive
minutes
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
if
they
were
expecting
peaceful
citizens
they
wouldnt
have
shown
up
in
livestock
trailers
and
would
have
retreated
immediately
not
a
smart
move
unless
meant
to
be
part
of
the
surprize
cover
even
so
the
narrow
opening
of
the
trucks
simply
was
not
a
good
idea
a
side
opening
truck
would
have
been
much
better
more
like
a
covered
waggon
so
were
the
batf
fired
on
before
or
after
they
left
the
trailers
to
knock
on
the
door
to
serve
the
warrant
every
description
ive
heard
indicates
the
batf
did
not
hang
around
in
the
trailers
once
they
decided
to
open
them
up
for
that
matter
if
they
expect
peaceful
citizens
why
come
in
live
stock
trailers
to
being
with
if
they
were
expecting
peacful
citizens
why
show
up
with
over
a
hundred
officers
some
of
which
clearly
visible
on
video
to
be
carrying
submachineguns
and
national
guard
helicopters
sounds
just
about
right
to
me
its
the
minimum
amount
of
force
that
i
would
consider
necessary
to
serve
a

on
the
talkpoliticsguns
annual

ok
just
to
make

weve

this
straight
you
consider
armed

in

to
be
used
to
serve
search

on
peaceful

and
just
so
we

of

you

weird
al
subject
re
law
and
economics
im
going
to
be
mixing
together
here
stuff
from
two
of
ted
franks
articles
which
was
a
response
to
me
and
a
response
to
tim
smith
yes
i
know
the
boomer
court
didnt
call
it
eminent
domain
but
if
it
walks
like
eminent
domain
and
swims
like
eminent
domain
and
quacks
like
eminent
domain
wdstarr
are
all
tort
cases
really
eminent
domain
cases
then
what
about
bankruptcy
contract
eminent
domain
is
a
statemandated
transaction
in
which
one
party
is
required
to
sell
a
piece
of
property
which
it
owns
to
another
party
regardless
of
whether
the
first
party
wishes
to
sell
at
all
at
a
price
which
is
set
by
the
state
i
fail
to
see
how
this
doctrine
can
be
found
in
tort
bankruptcy
or
contract
cases
in
general
well
okay
sort
of
in
bankruptcy
if
so
so
what
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
preventing
parties
from
reaping
windfall
settlements
from
other
parties
when
those
settlements
arise
from
wrongful
acts
by
those
other
parties
wdstarr
since
you
said
that
boomers
reliance
on
economics
led
to
an
unjust
result
im
pointing
out
that
your
alternative
is
far
more
unjust
in
the
traditional
sense
of
the
world
atlantic
cements
act
was
not
wrongful
it
did
something
that
we
as
a
capitalistic
society
should
want
them
to
do
build
a
factory
create
industry
and
jobs
the
cost
of
compliance
was
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
damage
faced
by
plaintiffs
bang
heres
one
of
the
places
where
we
widely
diverge
you
believe
that
the
courts
in
deciding
a
civil
dispute
between
two
parties
should
consider
as
a
factor
perhaps
as
an
overriding
factor
issues
which
i
believe
the
court
should
ignore
as
being
irrelevant
to
the
dispute
boomer
v
atlantic
cement
co
was
an
action
brought
by
one
party
boomer
whose
property
rights
were
being
violated
on
an
ongoing
basis
by
another
party
the
atlantic
cement
company
the
facts
supported
boomers
contention
that
atlantic
cement
was
wrongfully
damaging
his
property
and
boomer
asked
the
court
to
order
atlantic
cement
to
stop
doing
so
end
of
story
there
was
no
reason
for
the
court
to
consider
such
issues
as
what
a
capitalistic
society
would
want
atlantic
cement
to
do
or
whether
the
cost
of
compliance
was
disproportionate
to
the
damage
faced
by
the
plaintiffs
those
issues
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
before
the
court
bill
if
the
government
had
stepped
in
and
the
epa
made
a
regulation
requiring
multimillion
dollar
cement
plants
to
be
shut
down
because
of
a
smattering
of
cement
dust
at
a
costbenefit
ratio
of
youd
be
up
in
arms
why
is
it
okay
for
the
judicial
branch
to
interfere
this
way
but
not
the
legislative
or
executive
branches
id
be
up
in
arms
why
do
you
assume
that
quite
the
contrary
id
probably
support
the
action
since
it
would
be
based
on
the
same
general
doctrine
as
the
decision
that
i
believe
would
have
been
correct
in
boomer
the
idea
that
peoples
property
rights
should
not
be
violated
for
reasons
of
economic
efficiency
in
boomer
it
was
boomers
property
rights
which
i
believe
the
court
should
have
protected
in
the
hypothetical
epa
ruling
youve
presented
its
the
american
peoples
collective
property
rights
in
a
healthy
physical
environment
what
good
is
costbenefit
ratio
of
if
you
wind
up
with
cement
dust
in
your
air
your
rule
makes
it
per
se
illegal
to
ever
operate
a
cement
plant
if
the
state
of
massachusetts
came
up
with
a
similar
regulation
youd
be
up
in
arms
and
complaining
about
interference
with
property
rights
and
fifth
amendment
violations
once
againwhy
is
it
okay
for
the
judicial
branch
to
interfere
this
way
but
not
the
legislative
or
executive
branches
or
are
you
not
the
libertarian
you
present
yourself
as
being
ted
frank
how
would
it
be
per
se
illegal
to
operate
a
cement
plant
wouldnt
it
just
mean
that
when
buying
land
for
a
cement
plant
you
would
have
to
either
buy
enough
land
so
that
most
of
the
pollution
would
stay
on
your
land
or
buy
pollution
easements
from
the
surrounding
landowners
tim
smith
all
it
takes
is
one
holdout
out
of
hundreds
of
neighbors
to
scrap
the
plant
furthermore
each
of
the
neighbors
is
going
to
want
the
full
benefit
of
the
bargain
under
the
resulting
bilateral
monopoly
a
bonanza
for
lawyers
to
be
sure
who
get
to
negotiate
each
of
these
agreements
a
windfall
for
homeowners
who
can
extort
away
any
profits
the
plant
would
make
but
not
particularly
good
for
society
yes
so
what
the
courts
are
supposed
to
protect
the
specific
rights
of
individuals
not
the
general
interests
of
some
nebulous
society
if
society
can
have
its
cement
plant
without
violating
anyones
rights
fine
otherwise
society
will
somehow
have
to
limp
along
with
one
less
cement
plant
see
ted
i
really
am
a
libertarian
after
all
thats
the
whole
point
behind
the
coase
theorem
in
a
world
without
transactions
costs
the
land
will
automatically
be
put
to
the
best
use
as
it
is
transferred
from
person
to
person
instantaneously
without
friction
the
legal
regime
will
not
matter
because
the
result
will
be
the
same
in
a
world
such
as
ours
one
with
transactions
costs
one
wants
the
legal
regime
to
approximate
the
end
result
to
begin
with
in
order
to
minimize
the
transactions
costs
one
wants
the
legal
regime
to
approximate
the
end
result
to
begin
with
in
order
to
minimize
the
transactions
costs
which
one
are
you
speaking
of
i
want
the
legal
regime
to
protect
peoples
rights
besides
coases
theorem
only
has
real
application
in
the
nevernever
land
of
perfectly
rational
actors
in
the
real
world
some
people
are
going
to
be
stubborn
ornery
spiteful
or
otherwise
irrational
from
a
economic
point
of
view
and
the
purpose
of
the
courts
is
to
protect
their
right
to
be
so
i
dont
care
if
you
can
show
me
logically
that
your
cattle
are
only
doing
of
damage
to
my
property
per
head
so
i
should
rationally
sell
you
grazing
rights
to
my
land
for
say
per
head
i
still
retain
the
right
to
tell
you
that
i
just
plain
dont
want
any
damned
cattle
on
my
property
not
at
any
price
and
then
you
say
everyones
property
rights
were
protected
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
unnecessary
settlement
costs
were
avoided
as
above
i
dispute
your
claim
that
the
plaintiffs
were
made
whole
they
were
in
fact
by
court
action
deprived
of
their
rights
as
owners
of
property
to
choose
to
sell
or
not
sell
that
property
at
a
price
acceptable
to
them
wdstarr
then
by
your
argument
no
tort
plaintiff
is
ever
made
whole
because
the

should

treat

plaintiff
any
different

in

to

come
dangerously

to

then
by
your
argument
no
tort
plaintiff
is
ever
made
whole
because
the
award
of
damages
in
involuntary
claim
youre
at
least
partially
right
faced
with
situations
in
which
the
wrong
has
already
been
done
and
the
damage
to
the
victim
has
already
taken
place
and
cannot
be
reversed
or
undone
courts
will
try
to
set
an
equitable
price
tag
on
the
loss
suffered
by
the
victim
and
require
the
wrongdoer
to
pay
this
price
rather
than
an
inflated
price
which
the
victim
might
prefer
in
these
cases
the
sale
has
already
taken
place
and
is
irreversible
and
the
court
simply
tries
to
ensure
that
a
fair
price
is
paid
under
the
doctrines
that
a
only
in
certain
circumstances
should
even
a
civil
wrongdoer
be
forced
to
pay
punitive
or
excessive
prices
and
b
even
a
genuine
victim
should
not
profit
in
an
unjustified
or
inequitable
manner
from
his
victimhood
both
of
these
doctrines
may
be
worth
discussing
or
debating
elsewhere
but
neither
is
relevant
to
cases
like
boomer
in
which
the
wrongful
act
and
the
loss
stemming
from
it
are
still
in
the
future
and
can
be
reversedundone
ie
prevented
from
happening
at
all
by
order
of
the
court
in
these
types
of
cases
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
require
that
the
potential
victims
property
rights
are
protected
until
and
unless
he
agrees
to
sell
them
at
a
mutuallyacceptable
price
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
guess
at
the
equitable
value
of
the
loss
and
force
both
sides
to
accept
its
finding
it
can
leave
that
operation
up
to
the
parties
themselves
and
again
i
ask
since
when
are
the
courts
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
avoided
if
so
ive
been
miseducated
i
always
thought
that
the
courts
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
business
of
ensuring
that
justice
is
done
unnecessary
settlement
costs
are
unjust
because
they
are
punitive
in
cases
like
boomer
theyre
simply
a
cost
of
doing
business
the
fact
that
the
proprietors
of
the
atlantic
cement
co
got
themselves
into
a
position
in
which
they
found
themselves
over
this
barrel
is
simply
a
result
of
their
own
poor
business
decision
to
start
up
a
cement
plant
without
first
trying
to
negotiate
with
boomer
and
everyone
else
whose
property
rights
theyd
be
violating
via
the
operation
of
their
plant
theres
nothing
punitive
or
unjust
about
it
it
is
completely
sensible
only
if
you
believe
that
the
alleged
right
of
the
owners
of
atlantic
cement
to
stay
in
business
and
avoid
losing
a
lot
of
their
own
money
due
to
their
own
wrongful
act
and
the
alleged
right
of
several
hundred
atlantic
cement
employees
to
not
have
their
jobs
disappear
should
trump
the
rights
of
people
who
own
property
which
was
damaged
by
atlantic
cements
wrongful
acts
wdstarr
anybody
who
ever
commits
a
wrongful
act
should
disgorge
their
entire
set
of
possessions
to
wronged
person
werent
you
complaining
about
excess
punitive
damages
before
anybody
who
wants
to
commit
a
wrongful
act
in
the
future
should
be
required
to
buy
the
right
to
do
so
from
the
victim
in
advance
and
the
seller
should
be
allowed
to
set
his
or
her
price
for
the
privilege
no
injustice
no
punitive
damages

i
didnt

if
anything

he
had

wdstarr
in

he
cites
it
as
an
example
of
bilateral
monopoly
that
the
court
correctly
avoided
im
sure
its
covered
in

and
posner

presumably
favorably
but
i
dont
have
that
book
in
front
of
me
doesnt
sound
very
much
like
a
libertarian
to
me
libertarians
tend
to
believe
in
the
rights
of
individual
people
not
societies
ive
admitted
that
my
understanding
of
the
field
generally
referred
to
as
law
and
economics
is
weak
if
it
advocates
the
use
of
economical
analysis
as
one
of
many
tiebreaker
factors
which
courts
may
use
to
help
them
reach
decisions
in
cases
in
which
the
dispute
as
measured
by
the
scale
of
justice
is
evenly
balanced
fine
but
as
illustrated
by
boomer
it
is
not
fine
when
the
courts
start
viewing
the
economics
of
a
case
as
being
more
important
than
the
justice
of
a
case
wdstarr
in
this
case
the
justice
of
the
case
was
intricately
tied
up
with
the
economics
of
the
case
atlantic
cement
committed
a
tort
causing
of
damage
should
it
pay
in
the
millions
or
just
compensate
for
the
damage
it
committed
as
stated
above
the
tort
was
ongoing
atlantic
cement
wanted
to
be
able
to
continue
to
violate
boomers
rights
while
the
court
may
have
been
justified
in
setting
an
equitable
price
tag
on
the
damage
already
committed
it
had
no
reason
and
no
need
to
set
a
price
tag
on
the
future
violations
of
boomers
rights
and
to
then
force
boomer
to
sell
at

price

thus
the

italy
what
looks
likely
to
happen
is
the
fringe
parties
are
going
to
do
much
better
in
the
next

most
of
the
parliamentary
deputies
are
going

replaced
and
the

are
going

be
forced
to
look

people

look

this
is

perhaps

the

the

sunday
is
expected
to
establish
a
britishamerican
style
firstpastthepost
system
in
the

if
implemented
it
would
encourage
a
two

perhaps
three

system
in
italy
most
likely
the
dc
and
psi
will
not
be
these
parties
rather
there
will
be
a
shakeup
of
the
entire

structure
from
which
new

will
emerge
to
dominate
will
lega
nord
be
one
of
these
who
knows
the
camera
dei

lower
house
will
likely
remain
with

for

but
there
is
talk
of

too
maybe
as

the

on

the

for

was
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
isnt
is
funny
how
someone
who
seems
to
know
nothing
about
homosexuality
uses
a
very
flawed
imho
source
of
information
to
pass
jusgement
on
all
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
it
would
seem
more
logical
to
say
that
since
the
heterosexual
group
of
men
is
larger
then
the
chances
of
promiscuity
larger
as
well
in
my
opinion
orientation
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
dont
understand
what
you
are
getting
at
here
if
the
chances
of
promiscuity
are
larger
yet
the
rate
of
promiscuity
is
lower
in
the
heterosexual
community
doesnt
that
imply
that
the
homobi
sexual
population
is
then
even
more
promiscuous
than
the
raw
statistics
imply
no
axe
to
grind
here
im
just
a
scientist
and
i
hate
to
see
statistics
abused
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the
same
man
before
that
i
was
a
virgin
i
am
a
hetero
man
and
have
had
sex
with
one
woman
in
my
life
my
wife
it
is
very
pleasing
to
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
hope
you
have
the
same
feeling
as
i
do
i
also
wish
that
you
could
if
you
wanted
experience
the
joys
and
trials
of
being
committed
to
someone
for
life
there
is
something
about
marriage
that
makes
the
commitment
much
greater
than
one
might
expect
so
whose
promiscuous
just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt
mean
they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is
heterosexual
doesnt
mean
they
do
look
at
the
world
statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by
default
hetero
dont
forget
about
the
culture
sadly
we
dont
as
a
society
look
upon
homosexuality
as
normal
and
as
we
are
all
too
well
aware
there
are
alot
of
people
who
condemn
it
as
a
result
the
gay
population
is
not
encouraged
to
develop
nonpromiscuous
relationships
in
fact
there
are
many
roadblocks
put
in
the
way
of
such
committed
relationships
it
is
as
if
the
heterosexual
community
puts
these
blocks
there
so
as
to
perpetuate
the
claim
that
gays
are
immoral
my
if
we
allowed
gays
to
marry
raise
children
we
might
just
find
out
theyre
as
moral

we
are

be
abolished
to
start
with
the

is
immoral
whether
you
agree
with
that
or
not
we
dont
have
one
now
and
military
experts
agree
that
the
quality
of
the
armed
forces
is
superior
with
a
volunteer
army
than
with
draftees
finally
the
government
has
us
on
many
lists
in
many
computers
the
irs
social
security
admistration
and
motor
vehicle
registries
to
name
a
few
and
it
can
find
us
if
it
needs

maintaining
yet
another
list
of
people
is
an
utter
waste
of

and
time
lets
axe
this
whole
department
and
reduce
the
deficit
a
little
bit
im
really
surprised
clinton
hasnt
already
tried
to
do
this
he
seems
to
want
to
tackle
other
irrelevant
issues
first
so
why
not
this
one
as
well
considering
that
clinton
received
a
draft
notice
and
got
out
of
it
he
admits
it
the
political
feasibility
of
him
abolishing
it
is
not
something
he
would
be
inclined
to
risk
any
extra
exposure
on
let
me
say
this
about
that
as
a
retired
navy
officer
i
agree
cut
it
but
lets
not
stop
there
eliminate
the
transport
wrong
we
need
its
capability
sure
it
has
its
problems
very
few
airplanes
havent
but
getting
rid
of
something
we
need
is
not
the
answer
what
do
you
want
to
do
start
over
a
rebuild
a
new
airplane
from
scatch
itll
have
its
problems
as
well
and
there
will
be
calls
again
for
it
to
be
scrapped
the
other
option
is
to
try
to
extend
the
life
of
the
and
that
are
getting
extremely
old
if
you
read
aviation
week
the
line
can
be
reopened
and
the
would
be
delivered
a

cost
a

less

the

politically
though
the

pork
scrap

itll

im
for

we

the

litttle
about
agreed
congress
took
money
from

and
fha
to

the
second

the

are
still
building
los

class

and
there
is
a
lack
of
asw
foes
to
contend
with
the
navy
is
considering
reducing
the
number
of
attack
subs
to
navy
times
and
that
would
entail
getting
rid
of
or
mothballing
some
of
the
current
los

politically
general

is
in
connecticut
and
we
will
get

whether
we

not

this

does
nothing
to

if
anything
it
demonstrates
that
the

is

what
it
demonstrates
is
that

if

hes

i
do
agree
with
you
in

way
the

has
failed
but
in
my
opinion
that
doesnt
mean
we
have
to
give
up
only
change
the
tactics
for
instance
here
are
how
some
penalties
should
be
changed
dealing
coke
death
dealing
heroin
death
dealing
pot
death
dealing
crack
death
the
list
goes
on
and
on
just
kidding
however
on
a
more
serious
note
i
do
believe
that
we
should
take
some
money
away
from
the
foriegn
operations
in
south
america
and
costly
border
interdiction
efforts
dont
think
im
going
to
say
spend
it
to
educate
people
because
i
know
plenty
of
educated
dopers
actually
spend
it
on
things
like
drug
treatment
programs
i
saw
an
interesting
story
on

about
how
the
british
actually
prescribe

addict
his
recommended
dosage
and
try
to
ween
him
off
from
it
or
cut
the
amount
down
to
levels
where
it
is
acceptable
sounds
good
so
far
from
what
i
heard
with
a
decrease
in
cost
lower
addiction
rates
by
wiping
out
the
dealers
markets
etc
but
that
was
the
only
thing
i
have
heard
about
it
however
legalizing
it
and
just
sticking
some
drugs
in
gas
stations
to
be
bought
like
cigarettes
is
just
plain
silly
plus
i
have
never
heard
of
a

inflate
the

this

they
more

slants

really
makes

wonder

watching

why
are
you
all
playing
these
pathetic
number
games
the
number

people
showing

hardly
constitutes

i
doubt
that
it

more

a

some

by

president
clinton
already
started
passing
the
buck
by
saying
talk
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
fbi
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
done
but
the
decision
was
it
entirely
theirs
it
they
made
the
tactical
decision
enter
attorney
general
janet
reno
after
most
of
the
branch
davidians
died
reno
said
she
took
full
responsibility
for
the
decision
i
approved
the
plan
she
said
adding
that
she
did
not
advise
him
clinton
as
to
the
details
in
fact
she
told
clinton
that
it
was
the
best
way
to
go
as
the
fire
was
roaring
through
the
branch
davidians
compound
clinton
said
that
he
was
deeply
sadened
by
the
loss
of
life
and
in
the
same
breath
that
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
in
the
waco
siege
recommended
the
course
of
action
pursued
today
later
he
went
on
to
say
i
stand
by
that
renos
decision
how
did
this
all
begin
at
on
february
agents
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
batf
launched
a
fullscale
highprofile
assault
on
the
branch
davidians
compound
this
raid
was
much
more
than
an
assault
on
a
group
suspected
of
possessing
illegal
weapons
the
assault
was
a
planned
media
circus
used
as
a
propaganda
device
of
the
batf
to
show
their
might
and
just
purpose
at
the
onset
of
the
noknock
raid
gaggles
of
heavily
armed
batf
agents
made
their
way
inside
the
compound
without
identifying
themselves
or
state
that
they
had
a
warrant
until
long
after
the
shooting
began
silently
the
agents
made
their
way
to
the
compounds
buildings
and
started
their
search
by
charging
at
the
buildings
and
throwing
concussion
grenades
and
ordering
the
cult
members
to
come
out
of
the
buildings
if
unknown
persons
dressed
in
black
ninja
costumes
and
combat
fatigues
were
to
attack
you
throwing
grenades
and
brandishing
firearms
would
you
not
assume
that
these
people
are
criminals
and
attempt
to
defend
yourself
the
tactics
employed
by
the
batf
provoked
the
battle
the
initial
assualt
by
the
batf
was
not
successful
unfortunately
lives
were
lost
on
both
sides
but
had
the
assault
been
a
success
the
liberal
media
would
have
praised
the
batf
by
showing
the
footage
of
batf
agents
carting
away
a
bunch
of
gunwielding
religious
nuts
of
course
any
violation
of
the
cults
rights
would
have
been
overlooked
and
the
media
would
proclaim
americas
fortune
in
having
supercop
organizations
like
the
batf
that
can
systematically
take
out
terroristic
groups
such
as
the
branch
davidians
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
batf
and
the
fbi
dropped
the
ball
just
like
philadelphia
did
in
the
move
crisis
which
left
dead
homeless
and
a
city
block
razed
it
appears
that
the
batf
has
adopted
the
shootfirst
tactic
of
noknock
raids
to
execute
search
warrants
dont
let
the
batf
convince
you
that
the
noknock
raid
was
justified
noknock
assaults
make
sense
when
looking
for
say
drugs
that
can
easily
be
hidden
or
disposed
of
in
a
few
seconds
the
batf
was
looking
for
illegal
weapons
not
drugs
that
could
be
hidden
or
flushed
down

now
which
is
it
are
you
going
to
comdemn
national
media
then
turn
around
and
use
it
to
support
some
position
you
present
seems
somewhat
contradictory
doesnt
it
i
believe
that
this
is
not
contradictory
on
the
basis
that
the
quality
of
media
reporting
varies
greatly
based
on
the
subject
at
hand
the
media
has
proven
itself
very
accurate
is
the
areas
of
presenting
raw
undisputed
data
one
good
example
would
be
the
weather
page
in
which
high
and
low
temperatures
of
the
previous
day
for
a
large
number
of
locations
are
posting
there
is
little
evidence
to
show
that
they
are
in
error
i
believe
this
true
when
we
speak
of
physical
data
in
the
sense
of
pure
science
but
when
we
speak
of
data
that
revolve
around
social
sciences
then
we
have
to
be
careful
the
american
media
has
failed
us
in
its
analysis
of
complex
events
however
im
sure
that
we
can
come
up
with
many
news
stories
that
have
left
us
angry
because
so
many
facts
have
been
ommitted
cases
that
come
to
mind
are
the
invasion
of
panama
the
war
with
iraq
the
disaster
in
waco
the
issues
surrounding
the
acceptance
of
gays
into
the
military
the
war
on
drugs
and
many
others
i
quite
agree
but
these
are
cases
or
news
events
that
contain
politics
social
science
information
sociology
etc
and
at
best
are
reflections
of
the
group
that
reports
them
as
you
have
pointed
out
it
is
difficult
to
report
that
the
temperature
was
degrees
when
it
was
degrees
and
have
people
believe
you
the
story
that
you
bring
to
light
was
regarding
the
new
sex
survey
while
im
sure
that
due
to
lazyness
some
of
the
data
was
ommitted
from
the
article
i
would
venture
to
guess
that
the
data
that
was
presented
did
not
deviate
from
the
survey
i
do
however
think
that
it
would
be
folly
to
have
blind
faith
in
a
single
newswriters
analysis
of
this
data
in
this
particular
case
there
was
little
analysis
and
the
reader
was
left
to
draw
hisher
own
convictions
yes
and
no
the
survey
presented
according
to
mr
cramer
a
value
called
the
median
which
one
used
this
makes
us
believe
that
of
the
males
had
plus
sex
partners
and
of
the
males
had
or
less
sex
partners
homosexuals
are
purported
to
make
up
only
in
this
case
the
majority
of
people
with
plus
sex
partners
are
heterosexual
it
is
my
feeling
that
median
was
not
the
intended
word
usage
but
if
it
is
then
we
have
little
evidence
to
support
mr
cramer
claims
about
gay
promiscuity
hetero
promiscuity
many
netters
mr
cramer
included
often
forget
that
the
american
media
are
merely
a
number
of
businesses
whos
purpose
in
life
is
to
make
money
for
their
owners
and
stockholders
revenues
come
largely
from
advertisers
who
merely
want
maximum
useful
exposure
per
dollar
the
media
is
like
fast
food
the
quality
of
the
food
or
of
the
reporting
will
improve
only
if
the
customers
demand
as
such
otherwise
it
is
business
as
usual
very
good
this
is
a
point
that
i
have
tried
to
bring
out
and
as
any
network
news
program
will
show
you
it
is
true
the
news
media
is
a
business
and
as
such
becomes
skewed
because
of
where
its
loyalties
lie
there
is
an
old
statement
by
a
man
and
i
cannot
remember
him
or
his
statment
exactly
but
it
warns
against
the
merger
of
business
and
news
reporting
because
of
the
obvious
consequences

william

note
this
is
a
repost
of
my
earlier
response
to
mr
starr
which
was
not
properly
formatted
apologies
to
those
whove
seen
the
following
before
to
explain
my
position
on
the
war
on
drugs
i
offer
this
drugs
and
crime
a
new
approach
by
ken
barnes
given
that
the
trade
in
illegal
drugs
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
which
afflicts
our
nation
people
who
want
drugs
particularly
people
who
are
predisposed
to
addiction
will
find
a
way
to
get
them
whether
or
not
they
are
legally
available
despite
current
law
enforcement
efforts
drugs
are
readily
available
to
those
who
want
them
addiction
to
drugs
both
legal
and
illegal
is
responsible
for
a
significant
drain
on
the
productive
resources
of
our
country
and
this
occurs
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
the
cocaineaddicted
babies
who
are
unable
to
learn
to
the
spread
of
disease
among
addicts
to
the
tragic
consequences
of
alcohol
abuse
and
tobacco
smoking
a
general
economic
principle
of
government
is
that
whatever
is
subsidized
you
get
more
of
and
whatever
is
taxed
you
get
less
of
to
be
most
effective
in
confronting
the
nations
drug
problem
some
way
must
be
found
to
utilize
these
additional
powers
of
government
to
make
drug
dealing
and
drug
use
less
attractive
while
this
countrys
current
efforts
to
combat
legal
drugs
have
succeeded
in
some
respects
there
is
a
greater
awareness
of
the
health
consequences
of
smoking
and
designateddriver
programs
have
helped
reduce
drunk
driving
for
example
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
war
on
illegal
drugs
there
remains
a
core
group
of
illegal
drug
users
which
support
international
networks
of
smugglers
pushers
growers
processors
kingpins
and
gangsters
these
networks
and
their
marketing
activities
which
include
drive
by
shootings
corrupting
law
enforcement
authorities
and
smuggling
weapons
are
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
crimes
committed
in
our
country
every
day
clearly
illegal
drugs
and
rising
crime
are
linked
it
takes
only
a
moments
reflection
to
recognize
how
they
are
linked
the
link
is
money
as
with
this
countrys
failed
effort
to
prohibit
alcohol
consumption
a
black
market
has
been
created
in
which
greedy
local
monopolies
like
the
gangsters
of
a
bygone
era
have
profited
enormously
from
their
illegal
trade
the
victims
of
this
trade
include
not
only
the
innocent
people
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
in
the
crossfire
but
i
would
argue
the
drug
users
themselves
were
it
not
for
the
black
market
and
the
violent
monopoly
of
the
drug
lords
drug
users
might
not
be
the
thieves
robbers
prostitutes
and
murderers
they
have
become
in
order
to
pay
the
high
prices
the
drug
lords
demand
in
the
absence
of
the
drug
lords
most
would
be
i
believe
simply
people
with
a
problem
either
a
moral
problemora
medical
problem
butnota
criminal
problem
let
me
be
clear
however
i
amnotadvocating
that
we
let
the
criminals
who
have
been
preying
on
our
society
for
these
many
years
of
prohibition
off
the
hook
on
the
contrary
the
new
approach
i
advocate
is
one
which
would
not
result
in
either
the
government
or
private
industry
getting
into
the
business
of
promoting
crack
cocaine
or
any
other
presently
illegal
drug
for
that
matter
neither
is
it
an
approach
which
sees
law
abiding
citizens
handing
over
more
and
more
of
their
freedom
and
privacy
in
an
effort
to
track
down
illegal
drug
users
until
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
looks
like
a
police
state
here
then
is
my
proposal
possession
and
use
of
all
presently
illegal
drugs
is
decriminalized
but
buying
and
selling
them
remains
illegal
potheads
can
grow
their
own
marijuana
as
many
already
do
today
other
drug
users
can
legally
import
their
poison
of
choice
as
long
as
they
pay
the
tariffs
and
a
barter
economy
of
drug
experimenters
develops
because
of
the
barter
economy
which
supplies
the
drug
users
the
black
market
profits
that
have
so
enriched
the
drug
lords
dwindle
if
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
why
buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommercial
drugs
even
at
relatively
low
prices
therefore
law
enforcement
activity
is
concentrated
on
those
individuals
who
continue
to
buy
and
sell
and
also
on
the
crimes
committed
by
drug
users
too
poor
to
afford
even
low
prices
but
here
is
where
the
strategy
begins
to
differentiate
between
the
drug
dealers
the
victimizers
and
the
drug
users
their
victims
upon
arrest
foranycrimesuspects
are
permitted
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
will
undergo
a
drug
test
those
who
choose
to
cooperate
are
informed
that
upon
conviction
for
the
crime
they
are
accused
of
if
they
are
found
to
be
a
drug
user
they
will
be
institutionalized
until
they
are
clean
and
only
then
will
they
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
if
they
choose
to
cooperate
and
are
already
drugfree
they
can
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
right
away
those
who
choose
not
to
undergo
the
drug
test
and
are
convicted
face
stiffer
fines
and
serve
longer
sentences
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
serves
several
purposes
drug
using
criminals
and
this
includes
drunk
andor
stoned
drivers
are
separated
from
their
sources
of
supply
thus
reducing
the
total
number
of
drug
users
in
society
at
large
and
consequently
decreasing
the
demand
for
drugs
on
the
street
putting
more
of
the
remaining
drug
dealers
out
of
business
institutionalization
provides
an
incentive
for
drug
using
criminals
to
straighten
themselves
out
before
becoming
part
of
the
general
prison
population
while
helping
protect
society
from
crime
institutionalization
could
also
serve
to
deter
drug
users
from
becoming
criminals
since
drug
using
criminals
unlike
other
criminals
would
be
delayed
prior
to
serving
their
sentences
by
the
additional
time
it
takes
for
them
to
sober
up
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
separate
from
the
general
prison
population
would
also
provide
a
closely
monitored
pool
of
addicts
who
could
volunteer
for
research
studies
of
new
techniques
and
treatments
for
addictive
disease
with
the
potential
to
benefit
both
themselves
and
others
dealers
in
illegal
drugs
are
generally
not
drug
users
themselves
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
the
drug
bosses
or
kingpins
running
large
illicit
organizations
under
this
proposal
dealers
would
be
more
readily
identifiable
since
upon
arrest
they
would
presumably
pass
the
drug
test
or
else
decline
to
take
it
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
explain
why
they
are
in
possession
of
drugs
when
it
is
apparent
they
do
not
use
them
declining
to
take
the
test
they
would
of
course
face
stiffer
penalties
while
each
case
of
attempted
sale
of
a
noncommercial
drug
would
have
to
stand
on
own
its
merits
the
outcome
of
a
suspects
drug
test
could
provide
additional
evidence
for
the
prosecution
just
as
cigarette
taxes
have
contributed
to
the
decline
of
smoking
in
our
country
by
making
cigarettes
more
costly
while
at
the
same
time
providing
revenue
for
antismoking
campaigns
noncommercial
drugs
should
be
taxed
and
the
money
generated
should
be
used
to
combat
their
use
enforcement
of
this
tax
should
be
on
a
voluntary
basis
however
and
should
not
be
used
as
an
excuse
to
infringe
on
the
rights
and
privacy
of
noncommercial
drug
users
since
to
do
so
would
have
the
effect
of
reintroducing
prohibition
instead
drug
users
will
be
encouraged
to
pay
the
tax
by
reminding
them
that
if
untaxed
drugs
are
ever
found
in
their
possession
during
the
course
of
routine
police
operations
they
will
be
required
to
pay
the
tax
immediately
or
else
forfeit
their
untaxed
drugs
to
be
destroyed
if
drug
dealers
are
found
to
be
selling
noncommercial
drugs
on
which
taxes
have
not
been
paid
they
will
face
additional
prosecution
for
evading
the
tax
the
strategy
of
adding
tax
evasion
to
drug
dealing
charges
is
already
in
use
in
some
jurisdictions
but
its
effectiveness
is
currently
limited
by
the
illegality
of
drug
possession
revenue
from
drug
possession
taxes
and
import
tariffs
would
be
used
to
fund
antidrug
advertising
campaigns
and
provide
support
to
private
sector
drug
treatment
programs
for
those
unable
to
afford
treatment
taxpayer
subsidies
to
all
drug
producers
must
be
ended
federal
support
of
tobacco
farming
is
both
immoral
and
wasteful
in
this
era
of
tight
budgets
and
the
marijuana
crops
grown
illicitly
on
federal
lands
in
many
states
must
likewise
be
eliminated
while
my
proposal
would
have
the
effect
of
permitting
the
use
of
what
are
now
illegal
drugs
it
would
hold
the
users
of
all
drugs
responsible
for
their
actions
and
i
believe
would
reduce
the
harm
drugs
have
on
our
society
particularly
the
crime
caused
by
the
illegal
drug
trade
so
long
as
we
remain
a
free
nation
with
relatively
porous
borders
and
freedom
for
our
citizens
to
travel
we
will
always
have
a
drug
problem
whether
it
takes
the
form
of
heroin
addicts
dying
in
abandoned
buildings
drunk
drivers
killing
and
maiming
others
on
our
streets
or
emphysema
patients
struggling
for
breath
after
a
lifetime
of
smoking
the
results
are
the
same
needless
suffering
and
death
as
a
society
we
must
recognize
that
while
our
society
permits
us
to
harm
ourselves
with
drugs
as
we
are
already
doing
regardless
of
the
drug
laws
we
must
take
a
stand
against
the
harm
that
drugs
and
drug
users
cause
to
others
we
must
particularly
oppose
the
vicious
and
violent
cartels
which
prey
on
the
weakness
of
drug
users
by
taking
the
profits
out
of
their
deadly
trade
my
proposal
goes
a
long
way
towards
shutting
down
these
powerful
criminal
organizations
the
question
of
whether
drug
use
is
a
moral
or
medical
problem
depends
on
which
group
of
drug
users
youre
talking
about
different
drugs
have
different
effects
and
some
are
more
addictive
than
others
the
addictiveness
of
a
drug
also
often
varies
between
individuals
and
so
we
have
some
people
who
can
drink
alcohol
in
moderation
while
others
find
they
cannot
resist
the
bottle
nicotine
which
former
surgeon
general
c
everett
koop
declared
to
be
as
addicting
as
heroin
is
a
legal
drug
with
known
harmful
effects
and
while
some
people
can
stop
smoking
by
willpower
alone
others
continue
to
smoke
even
after
treatment
for
lung
cancer
for
those
individuals
who
can
stop
taking
drugs
on
their
own
we
may
argue
that
because
they
have
chosen
to
use
them
this
represents
a
moral
failure
on
their
part
or
an
unwillingness
to
face
the
difficulties
of
life
but
for
the
addicts
while
they
may
have
chosen
to
use
drugs
the
first
time
by
the
time
they
discover
their
addiction
it
is
too
late
we
cannot
hold
them
responsible
for
their
disease
any
more
than
we
would
blame
someone
who
is
drowning
for
an
inability
to
swim
perhaps
they
should
have
known
not
to
go
near
the
water
or
perhaps
someone
should
have
warned
them
of
the
danger
but
in
their
present
circumstances
warnings
will
not
help
neither
does
it
help
for
the
drug
dealers

also
in

and
mail
there
was
a
letter
from
the
director
of
trauma
services
at
st
michaels
hospital
in
toronto
responding
to
an
article
on
a
study
comparing
heart
surgery
in
california
and
canada
in
which
some
canadian
doctor
worried
that
that
study
which
was
in
the
nejm
i
think
noted
that
the
frequency
of
heart
surgery
on
patients
over
seventy
increase
with
income
in
california
i
guess
richer
people
have
more
heart
disease
in
california
whereas
the
frequency
of
surgery
on
patients
over
seventy
in
canada
was
relatively
uniform
across
income
distribution
heart
surgery
was
more
frequent
in
california
but
mortality
and
outcomes
were
essentially
the
same
american
analysts
would
seize
on
the
results
as
proof
that
canada
rationed
vital
services
the
doctor
i
cant
recall
his
name
said
that
canada
is
rationing
vital
services
as
any
physician
can
plainly
see
he
said
that
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
they
cant
afford
it
is
no
different
from
a
system
in
which
people
are
refused
treatment
because
the
government
cant
afford
it
as
a
result
of
deliberate
underfunding
of
the
health
insurance
plan
in
fairness
he
did
say
that
both
the
us
and
canadian
systems
are
in
the
same
situation
the
ndp
cleaning
up
a
tory
spending
mess
and
just
when
i
thought
i
understood
canadian
politics
there
was
one
about
a
group
of
doctors
in
calgary
who
have
opened
canadas
first
usstyle
mri
clinic
as
an
alternative
to
the
provincially
owned
one
its
about
time
ive
ragged
on
my
own
doctor
friends
as
to
why
they
dont
invest
in
their
own
private
practices
in
the
end
its
their
money
but
they
choose
to
spend
it
on
americas
cup
pipedreams
and
thats
none
of
my
business
as
for
provincially
owned
for
sure
its
against
the
law
in
canada
for
governments
to
be
directly
involved
in
the
provision
of
health
care
except
in
the
military
or
native
reser
vations
what
that
term
actually
means
is
that
the
facility
gets
by
on
public
grants
to
meet
shortfall
from
lack
of
use
no
kidding
medical
practice
itself
is
much
more
conservative
up
north
my
own
best
friend
did
two
clerkships
at
the
mayo
clinic
in
rochester
mn
and
is
no
stranger
to
high
tech
medicine
but
his
boat
comes
first
there
were
some
people
expressing
concern
that
it
was
the
first
wedge
of
twotiered
health
care
and
that
it
might
violate
the
canada
health
act
no
its
probably
socialist
whiners
who
are
offended
that
we
have
private
practices
and
always
have
they
can
all
take
cash
anyways
so
why
not
have
a
particular
facility
the
canadian
big
government
mentality
often
imagines
government
where
it
does
not
even
exist
the
only
potential
problem
i
see
with
the
private
mri
facilty
in
calgary
is
the
selfreferral
problem
to
the
facility
for
the
doctors
who
have
a
financial
interest
in
it
which
is
basically
unethicalbut
in
canada
because
of
our
small
population
there
is
likely
only
to
be
a
few
private
facilities
involving
only
a
small
number
of
doctors
and
thus
i
dont
think
the
selfreferral
problem
which
is
an
epidemic
in
the
us
could
ever
get
out
of
hand
here
look
nobody
stopped
the
clinic
when
they
planned
on
the
mri
nobody
stopped
them
when
they
bought
it
nobody
seems
to
be
stopping
them
from
using
it
either
much
ado
about
nothing
thank
goodness
that
hockey
playoffs
have
started
it
is
an
experiment
that
will
be
certainly
be
watched
carefully
while
it
seemed
currently
unjustified
there
was
one
anecdote
told
by
the
head
of
the
partnership
to
demonstrate
the
mri
he
showed
an
image
of
an
injured
knee
which
happened
to
belong
to
the
manager
of
the
bank
who
approved
the
loan
he
said
that
without
it
the
guy
might
have
had
to
wait
a
month
or
more
at
the
provincial
mri
then
another
length
of
time
for
treatment
after
which
the
muscles
would
have
atrophied
and
rehabilitation
would
have
been
that
much
harder
if
that
isnt
the
first
whiff
of
two
tiers
i
dont
know
what
is
im
certain
there
is
exaggeration
somewhere
because
the
gao
study
of
canada
cited
often
on
usenet
did
not
find
access
to
mri
to
be
a
problem
ill
bet
the
doctor
is
relying
on
people
having
listened
to
american
trash
talk
on
cable
so
that
he
can
puff
his
chest
a
bit
there
are
already
a
few
treatment
regimens
for
knee
injuries
without
relying
on
mri
unfortunately
ive
had
a
few
and
im
not
a
banker
what
likely
happened
is
the
sponsors
of
the
private
mri
which
include
doctors
anticipated
that
alberta
would
need
more
mris
and
instead
of
waiting
for
the
health
planners
to
realize
they
needed
another
one
or
two
saw
a
business

they
would
have
a

homosexual
activities
in
the
last
decade
is
and
the
number
of
men
who
are
exclusively
homosexual
is
these
figures
are
much
less
than
those
that
came
from
earlier
studies
that
showed
that
homosexuality
among
men
is
a
lot
higher
so
what
can
we
deduce
from
these
figures
are
there
a
lot
less
male
homosexuals
than
there
used
to
be
or
are
men
perhaps
women
too
not
as
honest
as
they
used
to
be
about
there
sexuality
presumably
the
people
that
were
polled
in
you
mean
in
the
men
and
women
were
much
more
open
about
their
homosexuality
than
today
want
to
try
that
one
again
this
survey
were
assured
of
their
anonymnity
so
they
should
have
answered
the
questions
honestly
i
suppose
however
it
could
be
that
gays
feel
so
repressed
and
denigrated
by
society
that
they
didnt
feel
that
they
could
be
forthcoming
about
there
sexuality
in
something
like
a
survey
if
this
true
then
is
it
possible
that
there
is
a
lot
more
gays
out
there
than
we
are
led
to
believe
perhaps
if
americans
were
more
open
about
there
sexualityi
think
most
americans
arentthen
we
might
discover
that
there
are
really
quite
a
few
more
people
out
there
who
are
orientated
toward
the
same
sexmen
and
women
included
id
venture
a
guess
that
there
is
a
lot
of
people
out
there
who
have
considered
having
a
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex
at
some
point
in
there
life
maybe
they
didnt
take
their
longings
seriously
but
this
doesnt
make
these
longings
any
less
valid
therefore
if
americans
werent
so
repressed
about
their
sexuality
in
generalas
i
believe
they
may
be
then
wed
see
a
lot
more
people
coming
out
of
the
closet
you
mean
ignore
study
after
study
so
that
we
can
continue
to
accept
a
study
kinseys
that
is
obviously
wrong
as
for
myself
im
a
heterosexual
and
ive
never
considered
having
sex
with
another
man
thats
just
the
way
i
ami
could
have
just
as
easily
of
been
gay
i
suppose
one
of
the
big
debates
about
homosexuality
is
whether
or
not
its
a
type
of
behavior
that
is
learned
or
if
one
is
just
born
that
way
imho
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
its
some
combination
of
the
two
based
on
what
besides
your
own
warm
fuzzy
feelings
heres
something
to
ponder
upon
have
any
of
you
gaybashers
out
there
ever
considered
that
homosexuals
probably
deem
their
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
state
of
affairs
that
is
just
as
much
an
intrinsic
and
natural
part
of
their
life
as
heterosexuals
do
about
their
own
sexuality
in
other
words
someone
who
is
truly
alcoholics
share
that
feeling
until
they
hit
bottom
gay
may
not
be
able
to
live
any
other
way
even
if
they
date
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
or
get
married
in
their
heart
they
are
still
a
homosexual
likewise
if
someone
who
is
truly
heterosexual
forms
a
relationship
with
someone
of
the
same
sex
then
they
are
still
a
heterosexual
even
though
outward
appearances
may
suggest
otherwise
scott
kennedy
brewer
and
patriot
unless
of
course
the
problem
is
that
homosexuality
is
a
form
of
mental
disorder
caused
by
childhood
sexual
abuse
as
a
number
of
recent
works
suggest
if
homosexuals
would
stop
using
the
government
to
impose
their
morality
on
others
antidiscrimination
laws
and
leave
our
children
alone
i
wouldnt
care
in
the
least
what
they
did
in
private
but
until
they
get
over
the
liberal
notion
that
the
proper
role
of
government
is
to
tell
peaceful
people
how
to
live
i
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
to
point
out
that
homosexuality
is
not
an
alternative
lifestyle
but
a
sickness

even

up

of

have

then
there
must
cite
a

bogus

be
an
even
larger

of
people
who
have
had

erotic

if
less

is
gay
what
can
we
say
about

obviously
a

to
choose
by

published
since

right

this

most
throrough
im

within

the

has
been
quite
active
since
it
was

ohsomany
years

they
too
recently
put
out
a
new

on
sexuality
i
was
quoting
a
news
story
i
have
no
idea
why
they
claim
this
was
the
most
through
examination
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
i
hate
to
be
picky
but
lets
do
the
math
if
we
take
the
cities
of
new
york
city
and
los

alone
we
can
find
approximately
million
gay
peoplemaking
about
million
gay

what
even
in
san

the
dept
of
public
health
estimates
that
only
of
the
male
population
is
gay
what
you
are
claiming
is
that
of
the
million
people
in
the
nyc
and
la
areas
that
more
than
are
gay
what
is
the
source
of
your
numbers
keep
in
mind
that
attempts
by
cdc
to
determine
homosexual
percentage
in
american
cities
have
given
numbers
of
the
american
male
population
is
about
million
so
what
this
study
says
is
that
all
gay
males
live
in
new

city
or
los

and
about
halfamillion
people
are
lying
about

it

we
have
all
you
have
to
do
is
realize
that
the
system
we
have
now
is
not
sacrosanct
in
fact
its
a
rigged
game
that
steals
you
blind
and
is
the
most
unfair
any
system
could
be
already
the
trick
is
to
realize
that
the
old
rich
have
been
making
the
rules
behind
your
back
and
that
its
time
to
kick
them
off
the
merrygoround
tax
the
rich
to
death
they
are
the
ones
that
converted
your
school
lunch
program
into
the
joke
it
is
today
they
are
the
ones
who
always
cut
education
they
are
the
ones
who
always
raise
the
rent
when
you
get
a
raise
they
are
the
ones
who
should
be
not
just
dislodged
but
killed
for
their
abuse
i
have
trouble
justifying
the
death
penalty
for
a
poor
kid
who
killed
and
didnt
know
why
not
i
have
no
trouble
justifying
the
death
penalty
for
the
rich
who
steal
countless
human
lives
to
feed
their
greed
have
you
paid
rent
most
of
your
life
then
you
have
been
enslaved
percentage
wise
most
of
your
life
we
used
to
be
serfs
now
we
are
called
renters
and
we
are
still
enslaved
to
somebody
who
claims
to
own
land
they
dont
use
and
make
us
pay
them
for
it
when
they
did
nothing
to
own
it
most
rents
in
california
are
enough
to
buy
the
apartment
house
paynthe
taxes
and
the
insurance
and
have
a
little
left
over
to
travel
with
i
have
seen
the
books
i
know
what
my
landlord
pays
and
to
whom
i
know
what
i
pay
her
i
am
being
forced
to
buy
her
a
building
and
then
i
will
be
let
out
at
the
other
end
with
nothing
when
i
had
as
much
right
as
her
to
live
on
this
planet
and
her
child
will
have
the
money
to
likewise
enslave
my
child
i
hope
i
find
out
when
i
am
going
to
die
i
can
make
things
just
a
little
happier
form
me
to
be
able
to
destroy
her
life
as
she
destroyed
mine
and
maybe
i
can
take
a
few
other
landlords
with
me
and
their
heirs
that
would
be
worth
it
then
to
be
able
to
die
before
they
can
do
anything
to

there
is
a
big
difference
between
running

charging

more
becuase
people
think
that
aids
is
a
gay
disease
is
actively
ripping

really
i
thought
that
insurance

hired
all

determine
the

that

are
those

if

by
philip
nobile
far
out
on
the
grassy
knoll
of
sexology
there
is
a
cult
of
prochastity
researchers

claim
that
the
late
alfred
kinsey
was
a
secret
sex
criminal
a

dr

in

the

usher
in

what
really
riles
these
critics
is
kinseys
towerin
cultural

his

surveys
sexual
behavior
in
the
human

tore

reisman
accused
kinsey
of
having
been
inolved
in
the
vicious
genital
torture
of
hundreds
of
children
she
speculated
that
he
kidnapped
and
drugged
ghetto
boys
in

to
carry
out
clandestine
orgasm
tests
now
seven
years
later
reisman
has
revived
her
charges
in
a
different
book
titled
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
just
released
by
the
small
and
religiously
oriented
huntington
house
in
lafayette
louisiana
her
coauthor
is
ed
eichel
a
manhattan
psychotherapist
who
has
invented
a
new
style
of
intromission
the
coital
alignment
technique
that
supposedly
triggers
simultaneous
orgasm
with
considerable
regularity
and
thereby
increases
compatibilty
between
the
sexes
in
the
book
eichel
contends
that
kinsey
deliberately
cooked
the
gay
stats
because
being
an
oddball
himself
he
wanted
to
advance
the
denormalization
of
heterosexuality
if
the
authors
are
right
then
the
world
famous
kinsey
reports
are
as
the
introduction
boldly
asserts
the
most
egregious
example
of
scientific
deception
in
this
century
and
if
they
are
wrong
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
is
a
shameful
smear
despite
the
less
than
stellar
credentials
of

way

so
it
should
not
surprise
anybody
that
kinsey
who
filmed
strange
people
having
sex
in
his
attic
may
have
had
skeletons
in
the
closet
the
problem
is
that

to
pull
off

regnery
was

wanted

of

after

summoned

incredibly
this

surpassed

of

commission
when
the

and
oversold
project
was
completed
in
it
was
immediately
shelved
by

that

regnery
resigned
from

only
days
before
the
new
republic
carried
this
admission
that
he
had
kept
porno
magazines
around
the
house
notwithstanding
the
sixfigure
humiliation
reisman
went
on
to
scratch
out
a
niche
on
the
ioony
right
as
the
darling
of
the
sex
cranks
she
deplores
subversive
phenomena
like
shaved
genitalia
in

magazines
and
blames

on
gays
kinsey
sex
and

is
reismans
latest
grasp
for
respectability
pat
buchanan
of
course
is
putting
his
krugerrands
on
reismans
ultimate
vindication
this
book
is
social
dynamite
he
says
in
a
blurb
an
the
front
cover
he
especially
liked
the
antigay
parts
smacking
his
lips
in
his
syndicated
column
he
declared
it
may
just
blow
the
sewer
cap
off
kinseys
monumental
reputation
reestablish
homosexuality
as
a
aberration
expose
the
gay
rights
movement
as
a
paper
tiger
and
even
put
at
risk
the
enormous
sex
industry
built
upon
dr
kinseys
research
the
blockbuster
charge
at
the
heart
of
the
cluttered
and
repetilive
jaccuse
is
that
kinsey
was
a
sexmad
pedophile
who
molested
little
boys
in
nazitype
experiments
and
recorded
their
orgasms
in
his
male
volume
a
similar
charge
was
first
recited
at
the
fifth
world
conference
on
sexology
in
jerusalem
in
to
no
effect
before
being
recycled
by
reisman
for
buchanan
in
washington
in
here
is
how
reisman
and
eichel
repackaged
the
mengele
business
in
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
mengelelike
scientific
experiments
on
infants
and
children
were
the
basis
for
kinseys
conclusions
on
childhood
sexuality
somewhere
and
sometime
in
the
course
of
the
project
kinsey
appears
to
have
directed
experimental
sex
research
on
several
hundred
children
aged
from
two
months
to
almost
years
this
of
course
would
implicate
kinsey
and
his
team
in
promoting
and
perhaps
participating
in
the
criminal
activity
in
the
opinion
of
this
books
authors
that
is
exactly
how
part
of
kinseys
child
sexuality
research
took
place
donning
his
psychohistorians
cap
and
citing
an
fbi
manual
on
child
molesters
as
a
guide
eichel
casually
diagnoses
kinsey
as
a
homosexual
pedophile
with
the
perfect
motive
for
doing
exactly
as
reisman
said
kinsey
placed
himself
in
professional
and
nonprofessional
positions
where
he
had
access
to
young
boys
such
as
ymca
camp
counselor
boys
club
leader
and
boy
scout
leader
activities
he
kept
up
during
his
college
and
graduate
yeaers
and
even
after
his
marriage
as
crude
as
his
analysis
seems
eichel
was
more
than
happy
to
elaborate
even
further
in
a
recent
phone
interview
if
youve
ever
been
around
boy
lovers
pedophiles
they
are
absolutely
compulsive
he
averred
everything
in
his
life
is
directed
at
getting
children
i
didnt
mention
this
in
our
book
but
the
caption
under
kinseys
high
school
picture
was
a
quote
from
hamlet
man
delights
me
not
no
sic
nor
woman
neither
what
do
you
think
they
were
picking
up
on
before
weighing
what
reisman
and
eichel
pass
off
as
proof
of
kinseys
sex
crimes
something
must
be
said
about
kinseys
scientific
modus
operandi
he
was
a
fiendish
collector
as
a
young
zoologist
with
a
dsc
from
harvard
he
collected
million
gall
wasps
and
million
related
insects
when
he
switched
to
sex
exploration
after
agreeing
to
teach
a
marriage
course
at
indiana
university
in
he
was
no
less
curious
or
acquisitive
nothing
that
mammals
did
in
the
realm
of
reproduction
was
foreign
to
him
he
compiled
masses
of
erotic
materials
including
toilet
wall
inscriptions
from
male
and
female
johns
that
highlighted
differences
in
sexual
psychology
and
flms
of
mating
in
species
of
animals
that
showed
an
amazing
similarity
in
oral
eroticism
naturally
the
sexual
response
of
children
the
genesis
of
eros
fascinated
him
it
was
impossible
to
understand
the
sexual
behaviors
of
adults
without
examining
their
origins
and
so
with
the
fervor
of
his
bughunting
days
kinsey
collected
information
about
kids
though
even
his
worst
enemies
until
reisman
and
eichel
refrained
from
linking
him
personally
to
his
data
on
preadolescent
sex
kinsey
said
plainly
in
the
male
volume
that
he
got
information
on
the
sex
life
of
young
boys
from
people
who
had
sex
with
them
some
of
these
adults
are
technically
trained
persons
who
have
kept
diaries
or
other
records
which
have
been
put
at
our
disposal
although
he
gathered
much
boyhood
data
from
the
memories
of
his
subjects
and
the
observations
of
parents
and
nursery
school
teachers
he
treated
the
documentary
materia
of
the
pedophiles
as
pure
gold
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
the
literature
kinseys
main
source
a
govemment
worker
was
also
the
most
unforgettable
character
he
had
ever
met
this
man
whose
history
took
hours
to
log
had
sex
with
over
boys
and
girls
as
well
as
of
family
members
including
his
father
and
grandmother
a
sexual
hobbyist
and
passionate
recordkeeper
he
gave
kinsey
detailed
accounts
of
orgasms
that
he
observed
in
preadolescent
boys
relying
on
the
mans
meticulous
research
which
involved
following
some
boys
for
as
long
as
years
kinsey
was
able
to
identify
for
the
first
time
six
distinct
types
of
male
orgasm
some
of
which
involved
violent
contortions
at
the
peak
of
release
as
well
as
the
speed
and
the
capacity
of
climax
what
freud
had
only
imagined
about
childhood
sexuality
kinsey
had
reported
as
fact
children
were
indeed
erotic
beings
from
the
cradle
these
data
on
the
sexual
activities
of
younger
male
provide
an
important
substantiation
of
the
freudian
view
of
sexuality
as
a
component
that
is
present
in
the
human
animal
from
earliest
infancy
he
concluded
without
raising
eyebrows
in
then
along
came
judith
reisman
ignorng
the
legitimacy
of
kinseys
inquiry
she
beheld
the
ghost
of
mengele
in
bloomington
she
was
appalled
by
the
thought
of
infant
ecstasy
and
read
torture
in
the
portrayals
of
prepubertal
orgasm
rendered
by
the
government
worker
and
she
dared
to
say
that
kinsey
was
a
sex
criminal
well
was
he
or
wasnt
he
lets
go
to
the
text
there
is
no
evidence
in
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
no
witnesses
no
paper
noteven
a
trace
of
hearsay
that
implicates
kinsey
in
either
planning
or
partaking
in
child
sex
experiments
after
years
on
the
trail
reisman
has
uncovered
just
two
sources
to
back
up
her
original
charge
amazingly
enough
kinsey
himself
and
wardell
pomeroy
kinseys
coauthor
on
both
reports
to
whom
reisman
has
never
spoken
it
turns
out
that
her
whole
case
rests
on
a
few
passages
in
the
male
volume
iand
in
pomeroys
biography
titled
dr
kinsey
and
the
institute
for
sex
research
after
frisking
every
the
and
and
in
both
books
reisman
came
up
with
what
she
believes
are
smoking
sentences
to
establish
kinseys
alleged
role
in
the
planning
she
says
that
there
is
a
hint
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
male
volume
that
kinsey
directed
the
orgasm
studies
on
kids
she
cites
his
telltale
quote
from
a
critic
of
armchair
psychoanalysis
demanding
that
writerstest
their
theoriesby
empirical
study
and
statistical
procedures
then
she
combines
this
quote
with
kinseys
statement
that
some
of
the
observations
of
his
pedophile
sources
were
continued
over
periods
of
months
or
years
until
the
individuals
were
old
enough
to
make
it
certain
that
true
orgasm
was
involved
putting
two
and
two
together
kinseys
empiricism
and
lengthy
experimentation
she
arrives
at
her
hint
but
realizing
this
dog
would
not
hunt
she
devoted
but
a
single
paragraph
to
kinseys
supposed
planning
before
shifting
to
the
issue
of
his
personal
involvement
as
for
the
alleged
participation
after
poring
over
pomeroys
biography
reisman
found
several
hidden
clues
suggesting
kinseys
likely
handson
approach
to
kiddie
sex
here
the
chain
of
reasoning
is
more
complex
she
points
out
that
kinsey
was
interested
in
clitoral
measurements
collecting
sperm
and
filming
sex
in
his
attic
since
kinsey
did
indeed
mislead
indiana
university
about
the
purpose
of
his
cinematography
he
said
that
he
was
filming
animal
sex
reisman
asserts
that
a
similar
misrepresentation
may
yet
apply
to
kinseys
child
sex
experiments
catch
the
may
reisman
was
also
struck
by
kinseys
doubting
thomas
attitude
toward
the
never
before
recorded
climax
of
female
rabbits
kinsey
according
to
pomeroy
was
the
type
of
person
who
needed
to
see
things
for
himself
pomeroy
gave
the
example
of
orgasm
in
the
female
rabbit
because
he
had
not
personally
witnessed
this
event
kinsey
had
difficulty
in
accepting
its
reality
even
on
the
strength
of
testimony
from
a
distinguished
scientist
how
then
did
kinsey
testify
to
the
actuality
of
orgasm
in
a
infant
from
the
mere
history
of
a
sex
offender
but
of
course
he
did
not
he
depended
on
their
records
from
this
fantastic
alchemy
of
conjecture
mixed
with
clitorides
sperm
attic
cumshots
and
climaxincottontail
has
reisman
defamed
the
legendary
kinsey
paul
gebhard
succeeded
kinsey
as
the
director
of
the
kinsey
institute
and
now
lives
in
retirement
outside
bloomington
reached
by
telephone
gebhard
defended
the
pedophile
connection
and
denied
reismans
nasty
imputations
i
dont
understand
the
resistance
of
people
like
reisman
to
studying
the
sexuality
of
children
gebhard
said
more
in
exasperation
than
anger
that
is
where
sex
begins
we
were
happy
to
take
data
wherever
we
found
it
even
though
pedophiles
commit
criminal
acts
they
are
usually
not
violent
folks
they
wouldnt
be
very
successful
if
they
were
one
of
our
best
sources
was
a
headmaster
of
a
boys
school
who
maintained
a
kind
of
alumni
club
and
sometimes
went
to
the
weddings
of
his
former
students
as
for
directing
experiments
thats
absurd
we
never
told
any
of
our
subjects
what
to
do
lt
was
against
our
principles
almost
all
of
the
pedophile
material
was
retrospective
anyway
nor
did
we
ever
conduct
sex
experiments
with
children
ourselves
that
would
have
been
highly
inappropriate
i
asked
gebhard
if
kinsey
had
ever
seen
a
child
in
a
sexual
situation
i
think
a
mother
once
brought
in
a
little
girl
who
humped
her
teddy
bear
and
kinsey
watched
it
as
for
kinseys
sex
life
it
is
still
shrouded
in
confidentiality
he
was
married
to
the
same
woman
for
years
and
fathered
four
children
apparently
there
are
no
huge
sexual
revelations
although
rumors
of
homosexuality
have
persisted
without
confirmation
through
the
years
gebhard
took
his
bosss
history
back
in
the
but
he
refuses
to
discuss
what
he
knows
we
never
divulge
anything
about
anybodys
history
whether
dead
or
alive
he
says
reisman
said
no
to
an
interview
for
this
article
on
the
grounds
that
i
had
once
worked
for
penthouse
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
we
have
been
debating
each
other
in
various
forums
for
the
past
five
years
in
keeping
with
our
contentious
history
she
took
a
swipe
at
me
in
her
book
for
continuing
the
kinsey
practice
of
euphemizing
incest
my
offense
was
using
the
biblical
variant
lying
with
a
near
relative
in
a
article
on
the
subject
of
incest
as
a
synonym
for
intercourse
lying
with
appears
eight
times
in
genesis
ed
eichel
is
a
different
story
though
seemingly
obsessed
by
kinsey
like
his
coauthor
he
was
friendly
in
long
conversations
he
told
me
that
he
began
to
smell
a
big
baised
agenda
in
sexology
when
he
was
a
student
in
new
york
universitys
human
sexuality
program
in
the
early
it
was
literally
a
gay
studies
program
for
heterosexuals
he
says
around
eichel
came
upon
reismans
critique
of
kinsey
and
the
conspiracy
theory
started
to
sink
in
the
sex
establishment
was
ruled
by
a
kinseyan
bisexual
bund
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
heterosexual
norm
no
wonder
he
was
having
such
a
rough
time
promoting
the
joy
of
simultaneous
orgasm
anything
that
enhanced
sexual
compatibility
between
men
and
women
inevitably
raised
objections
eventually
eichel
exchanged
philosophical
fluids
with
reisman
and
from
this
union
kinsey
sex
and
fraud
was
born
eichels
main
contribution
to
the
book
is
discovery
and
analysis
of
a
kinsey
conspiracy
that
supposedly
seeks
the
establishment
of
bisexuality
as
the
balanced
sexual
orientation
for
normal
uninhibited
people
which
by
destroying
the
traditional
family
structure
and
normal
sexual
behavior
would
open
the
way
for
the
second
and
more
difficult
step
the
ultimate
goal
of
crossgenerational
sex
sex
with
children
when
i
pressed
him
for
specific
references
to
back
up
his
outrageous
contentions
he
said
weakly
you
dont
think
kinsey
is
going
to
come
right
out
and
say
that
everybody
is
basically
bisexual
and
should
have
sex
with
kids
but
this
is
implicit
in
the
kinsey
reports
meanwhile
eichel
is
demanding
a
congressional
investigation
of
kinsey
and
his
data
perfect
thats
just
what
the
country
needs

at
risk
and
that
some
die
during
a
hostage
situation
might
be
considered
an
acceptable
scenario
in
storming
a
compound
when
everyone
dies
save
for
nine
people
including
twenty
children
the
outcome
must
be
considered
a
failure
now
was
the
failure
due
to
unforseeable
circumstances
incompetence
or
negligence
from
the
double
talk
and
multiple
stories
ive
seen
on
the
news
coming
from
the
fbi
and
reno
i
find
it
was
an
honest
mistake
hard
to
swallow
lets
hope
they
get
their
stories
straight
for
the
second
round

then
i

what
a
nightmare
it
was
no

it
was
horribly
real
life
apparently
acting
on
information
the

possessed
an

some

according
to
neighbors
the

force
operation
aimed
at
the
unemployed
warehouseman
from
a
nearby
hospital
involved
some
agents
and

they
cordoned

broke
into

box
that
contained
precious

stood
on
a

to
peer
through

breaking

then
they

were
left
unsecured
my

the

any

promiscuous
if

with

of
willing
partners
if
true
and
if
gays
were
the
same
as
straights
except
for
sexual
preference
i
would
imagine
that
gays
would
have
much
less
sex
than
straights
because
the
available
pool
for
dates
is
less
than
onetenth
what
it
is
for
straights
somebody
correct

me
please
i
cannot
believe
i
am
posting
in
this
thread
but
what
the
hell
he
asked
for
it
i
had
sort
of
the
same
reaction
myself
when
i
was
first
realizing
i
was
bi
so
what
of
everyone
else
is
straight
id
never
end
up
with
a
guy
anyway
as
several
people
on
socbi
pointed
out
to
me
this
is
true
only
if
you
find
partners
for
relationships
or
just
for
sex
in
primarily
straight
circles
nowadays
with
gay
culture
quite
visible
in
major
cities
and
such
you
can
easily
find
yourself
in
an
overwhelmingly
queer
social
circle
if
you
so
choose
about
half
my
friends
are
bi
and
thats
just
from
hanging
out
in
the
science
fiction
club
and
going
to
ucbu
once
a
week
its
not
as
if
i
have
to
go
out
of
my
way
and
hang
out
in
bars
or
something
so
the
available
pool
for
dates
can
be
the
same
size
unless
of
course
youre
trying
to
date
a
random
sample
of
the
us
population
as
for
promiscuity
ive
traded
email
with
clayton
on
the
topic
and
he
still
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
admit
that
yes
gay
males
are
sometimes
forced
to
resort
to
anonymous
sex
because
theyre
closeted
and
cant
afford
to
be
seen
in
a
permanent
relationship
or
that
part
of
the
promiscuity
is
because
of
the
messedup
gender
roles
in
our
society
and
when
males
are
dating
males
and
theyve
all
been
trained
to
be
the
aggressor
in
sex
theres
going
to
be
more
sex
or
that
whats
dysfunctional
whats
screwed
up
is
societal
attitudes
not
gay
sexuality
and
thats
what
encourages
deviant
behavior
in
gay
males
also
note
that
just
because
someones
had
sex
partners
doesnt
mean
theyre
promiscuous
yes
it
sounds
ridiculous
but
its
quite
possible
for
someone
to
go
through
a
heavily
closeted
phase
in
which
they
have
lots
of
anonymous
sex
with
strangers
and
then
come
out
start
forming
real
relationships
and
be
monogamous

on

the
four
federal
agents
were
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry
and
ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at
risk
because
the
batf
operation
had
failed
to
meet
its
objective
a
standoff
ensued
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
then
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the
bureaus
efforts
were
ultimately
unavailing
because
the
individual
with
whom
they
were
dealing
david
koresh
was
dangerous
irrational
and
probably
insane
he
engaged
in
numerous
activities
which
violated
both
federal
law
and
common
standards
of
decency
he
was
moreover
responsible
for
the
deaths
and
injuries
which
occurred
during
the
action
against
the
compound
in
february
given
his
inclination
towards
violence
and
in
an
effort
to
protect
his
young
hostages
no
provocative
actions
were
taken
for
more
than
seven
weeks
by
federal
agents
against
the
compound
this
weekend
i
was
briefed
by
attorney
general
reno
on
an
operation
prepared
by
the
fbi
designed
to
increase
pressure
on
koresh
and
persuade
those
in
the
compound
to
surrender
peacefully
the
plan
included
a
decision
to
withhold
the
use
of
ammunition
even
in
the
face
of
fire
and
instead
to
use
tear
gas
that
would
not
cause
permanent
harm
to
health
but
would
it
was
hoped
force
the
people
in
the
compound
to
come
outside
and
to
surrender
i
was
informed
of
the
plan
to
end
the
siege
i
discussed
it
with
attorney
general
reno
i
asked
the
questions
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
i
then
told
her
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
and
i
take
full
responsibility
for
the
implementation
of
the
decision
yesterdays
action
ended
in
a
horrible
human
tragedy
mr
koreshs
response
to
the
demands
for
his
surrender
by
federal
agents
was
to
destroy
himself
and
murder
the
children
who
were
his
captives
as
well
as
all
the
other
people
who
were
there
who
did
not
survive
he
killed
those
he
controlled
and
he
bears
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
carnage
that
ensued
now
we
must
review
the
past
with
an
eye
towards
the
future
i
have
directed
the
united
stated
departments
of
justice
and
treasury
to
undertake
a
vigorous
and
thorough
investigation
to
uncover
what
happened
and
why
and
whether
anything
could
have
been
done
differently
i
have
told
the
departments
to
involve
independent
professional
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
investigation
i
expect
to
receive
analysis
and
answers
in
whatever
time
is
required
to
complete
the
review
finally
i
have
directed
the
departments
to
cooperate
fully
with
all
congressional
inquiries
so
that
we
can
continue
to
be
fully
accountable
to
the
american
people
i
want
to
express
my
appreciation
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
justice
department
and
to
the
federal
agents
on
the
front
lines
who
did
the
best
job
they
could
under
deeply
difficult
circumstances
again
i
want
to
say
as
i
did
yesterday
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
loss
of
life
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
tragedy
in
waco
i
hope
very
much
that
others
who
will
be
tempted
to
join
cults
and
to
become
involved
with
people
like
david
koresh
will
be
deterred
by
the
horrible
scenes
they
have
seen
over
the
last
seven
weeks
and
i
hope
very
much
that
the
difficult
situations
which
federal
agents
confronted
there
and
which
they
will
be
doubtless
required
to
confront
in
other
contexts
in
the
future
will
be
somewhat
better
handled
and
better
understood
because
of
what
has
been
learned
now
q
mr
president
can
you
first
of
all
tell
us
why
after
days
you
decided
q
mr
president
can
you
describe
for
us
what
it
is
that
janet
reno
outlined
to
you
in
your
phone
conversation
with
the
president
i
cant
hear
you
both
if
one
will
go
first
and
then
the
other
q

can
you
describe
what
janet
reno
q
mr

the
president
ill
answer
both
your
questions
but
i
cant
do
it
at
once
q
can
you
describe
what
she
told
you
on
sunday
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
and
how
much
detail
you
knew
about
it
the
president
yes
i
was
told
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
fbi
strongly
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
take
another
step
in
trying
to
dislodge
the
people
in
the
compound
and
she
described
generally
what
the
operation
would
be
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
use
tear
gas
which
had
been
tested
not
to
cause
permanent
damage
to
adults
or
to
children
but
which
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
people
to
stay
inside
the
building
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
tear
gas
would
permit
them
to
come
outside
i
was
further
told
that
under
no
circumstances
would
our
people
fire
any
shots
at
them
even
if
fired
upon
they
were
going
to
shoot
the
tear
gas
from
armored
vehicles
which
would
protect
them
and
there
would
be
no
exchange
of
fire
in
fact
as
you
know
an
awful
lot
of
shots
were
fired
by
the
cult
members
at
the
federal
officials
there
were
no
shots
coming
back
from
the
government
side
i
asked
a
number
of
questions
the
first
question
i
asked
is
why
now
we
have
waited
seven
weeks
why
now
the
reasons
i
was
given
were
the
following
number
one
that
there
was
a
limit
to
how
long
the
federal
authorities
could
maintain
with
their
limited
resources
the
quality
and
intensity
of
coverage
by
experts
there
they
might
be
needed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
number
two
that
the
people
who
had
reviewed
this
had
never
seen
a
case
quite
like
this
one
before
and
they
were
convinced
that
no
progress
had
been
made
recently
and
no
progress
was
going
to
be
made
through
the
normal
means
of
getting
koresh
and
the
other
cult
members
to
come
out
number
three
that
the
danger
of
their
doing
something
to
themselves
or
to
others
was
likely
to
increase
not
decrease
with
the
passage
of
time
and
number
four
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
children
who
were
still
inside
the
compound
were
being
abused
significantly
as
well
as
being
forced
to
live
in
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
so
for
those
reasons
they
wanted
to
move
at
that
time
the
second
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general
is
whether
they
had
given
consideration
to
all
of
the
things
that
could
go
wrong
and
evaluated
them
against
what
might
happen
that
was
good
she
said
that
the
fbi
personnel
on
the
scene
and
those
working
with
them
were
convinced
that
the
chances
of
bad
things
happening
would
only
increase
with
the
passage
of
time
the
third
question
i
asked
was
has
the
military
been
consulted
as
soon
as
the
initial
tragedy
came
to
light
in
waco
thats
the
first
thing
i
asked
to
be
done
because
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
not
a
typical
law
enforcement
situation
military
people
were
then
brought
in
helped
to
analyze
the
situation
and
some
of
the
problems
that
were
presented
by
it
and
so
i
asked
if
the
military
had
been
consulted
the
attorney
general
said
that
they
had
and
that
they
were
in
basic
agreement
that
there
was
only
one
minor
tactical
difference
of
opinion
between
the
fbi
and
the
military
something
that
both
sides
thought
was
not
of
overwhelming
significance
having
asked
those
questions
and
gotten
those
answers
i
said
that
if
she
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
that
she
should
proceed
and
that
i
would
support
it
and
i
stand
by
that
today
q
mr
president
the
president
wait
go
ahead
q
can
you
address
the
widespread
perception
reported
widely
television
radio
and
newspapers
that
you
were
trying
somehow
to
distance
yourself
from
this
disaster
the
president
no
im
bewildered
by
it
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
let
me
say
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
is
that
i
had
nothing
to
add
to
what
was
being
said
and
i
literally
did
not
know
until
rather
late
in
the
day
whether
anybody
was
still
alive
other
than
those
who
had
been
actually
seen
and
taken
to
the
hospital
or
taken
into
custody
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
waiting
for
events
to
unfold
there
was
i
have
i
cant
account
for
why
people
speculated
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
talked
to
the
attorney
general
on
the
day
before
the
action
took
place
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
i
called
her
again
late
last
night
after
she
appeared
on
the
larry
king
show
and
i
talked
to
her
again
this
morning
a
president
it
is
not
possible
for
a
president
to
distance
himself
from
things
that
happen
when
the
federal
government
is
in
control
i
will
say
this
however
i
was
frankly
surprised
would
be
a
mild
word
to
say
that
anyone
that
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
should
resign
because
some
religious
fanatics
murdered
themselves
applause
i
regret
what
happened
but
it
is
not
possible
in
this
life
to
control
the
behavior
of
others
in
every
circumstance
these
people
killed
four
federal
officials
in
the
line
of
duty
they
were
heavily
armed
they
fired
on
federal
officials
yesterday
repeatedly
and
they
were
never
fired
back
on
we
did
everything
we
could
to
avoid
the
loss
of
life
they
made
the
decision
to
immolate
themselves
and
i
regret
it
terribly
and
i
feel
awful
about
the
children
but
in
the
end
the
last
comment
i
had
from
janet
reno
is
when
and
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
i
said
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
once
more
why
you
believe
not
why
they
believe
why
you
believe
we
should
move
now
rather
than
wait
some
more
and
she
said
its
because
of
the
children
they
have
evidence
that
those
children
are
still
being
abused
and
that
theyre
in
increasingly
unsafe
conditions
and
that
they
dont
think
it
will
get
any
easier
with
time
with
the
passage
of
time
i
have
to
take
their
word
for
that
so
that
is
where
i
think
things
stand
q
can
we
assume
then
that
you
dont
think
this
was
mishandled
in
view
of
the
outcome
that
you
didnt
run
out
of
patience
and
if
you
had
it
to
do
over
again
would
you
really
decide
that
way
the
president
no
well
i
think
what
you
can
assume
is
just
exactly
what
i
announced
today
this
is
a
the
fbi
has
done
a
lot
of
things
right
for
this
country
over
a
long
period
of
time
this
is
the
same
fbi
that
found
the
people
that
bombed
the
world
trade
center
in
licketysplit
record
time
we
want
an
inquiry
to
analyze
the
steps
along
the
way
is
there
something
else
we
should
have
known
is
there
some
other
question
they
should
have
asked
is
there
some
other
question
i
should
have
asked
can
i
say
for
sure
that
no
one
that
we
could
have
done
nothing
else
to
make
the
outcome
come
different
i
dont
know
that
thats
why
i
want
the
inquiry
and
thats
why
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
we
have
some
independent
law
enforcement
people
not
political
people
but
totally
nonpolitical
outside
experts
who
can
bring
to
bear
the
best
evidence
we
have
there
is
unfortunately
a
rise
in
this
sort
of
fanaticism
all
across
the
world
and
we
may
have
to
confront
it
again
and
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anything
we
can
do
particularly
when
there
are
children
involved
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
wrongdoers
in
this
case
were
the
people
who
killed
others
and
then
killed
themselves
q
mr
president
were
there
any
other
options
presented
to
you
for
resolving
this
situation
at
any
point
from
february
until
yesterday
the
president
well
yes
i
got
regular
reports
all
along
the
way
there
were
lots
of
other
options
pursued
if
you
go
back
you
all
covered
it
very
well
the
fbi
you
did
a
very
good
job
of
it
i
mean
the
fbi
and
the
other
authorities
there
pursued
any
number
of
other
options
all
along
the
way
and
a
lot
of
them
early
on
seemed
to
be
working
some
of
the
children
got
out
some
of
the
other
people
left
there
was
a
at
one
point
there
seemed
to
be
some
lines
of
communication
opening
up
between
koresh
and
the
authorities
and
then
he
would
say
things
and
not
do
them
and
things
just
began
to
spin
downward
whether
there
were
other
in
terms
of
what
happened
yesterday
the
conversation
i
had
with
the
attorney
general
did
not
involve
other
options
except
whether
we
should
take
more
time
with
the
present
strategy
we
were
pursuing
because
they
said
they
wanted
to
do
this
because
they
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
get
people
out
of
the
compound
quickly
before
they
could
kill
themselves
thats
what
they
thought
q
did
the
government
know
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
q
congressional
hearings
once
the
situation
are
you
in
agreement
with
that
the
president
thats
up
to
the
congress
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
but
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
treasury
and
justice
departments
launch
this
investigation
and
bring
in
some
outside
experts
and
as
i
said
in
my
statement
if
any
congressional
committees
want
to
look
into
it
we
will
fully
cooperate
there
is
nothing
to
hide
here
this
was
probably
the
most
wellcovered
operation
of
its
kind
in
the
history
of
the
country
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
very
well
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
while
the
adults
did
so
the
children
had
no
chance
because
this
gas
was
very
she
said
it
was
not
lethal
but
it
was
very
dangerous
to
the
children
and
they
could
not
have
survived
without
gas
masks
and
on
february
lets
go
back
didnt
those
people
have
a
right
to
practice
their
religion
the
president
they
were
not
just
practicing
their
religion
they
were
the
treasury
department
believed
that
they
had
violated
federal
laws
any
number
of
them
q
what
federal
laws
the
president
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
gas
masks
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpose
of
using
the
tear
gas
was
that
it
had
been
tested
they
were
convinced
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
force
anybody
that
breathed
it
to
run
outside
and
one
of
the
things
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
details
of
this
because
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
things
that
they
were
speculating
about
today
was
that
the
wind
was
blowing
so
fast
that
the
windows
might
have
been
opened
and
some
of
the
gas
might
have
escaped
and
that
may
be
why
it
didnt
have
the
desired
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
was
an
underground
compound
a
bus
buried
underground
where
the
children
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hoping
very
much
that
if
the
children
were
not
released
immediately
outside
that
the
humane
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
children
would
be
sent
someplace
where
they
could
be
protected
in
terms
of
the
gas
masks
themselves
i
learned
yesterday
i
did
not
ask
this
fact
question
before
that
the
gas
was
supposed
to
stay
active
in
the
compound
longer
than
the
gas
masks
themselves
were
to
work
so
that
it
was
thought
that
even
if
they
all
had
gas
masks
that
eventually
the
gas
would
force
them
out
in
a
nonviolent
nonshooting
circumstance
ms
myers
last
question
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
that
q
could
you
tell
us
whether
or
not
you
ever
asked
janet
reno
about
the
possibility
of
a
mass
suicide
and
when
you
learned
about
the
actual
fire
and
explosion
what
went
through
your
mind
during
those
horrendous
moments
the
president
what
i
asked
janet
reno
is
if
they
had
considered
all
the
worse
things
that
could
happen
and
she
said
and
of
course
the
whole
issue
of
suicide
had
been
raised
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debated
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
people
who
were
most
knowledgeable
about
these
kinds
of
issues
concluded
that
there
was
no
greater
risk
of
that
now
than
there
would
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
that
or
at
anytime
in
the
future
that
was
the
judgment
they
made
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
of
course
we
will
never
know
what
happened
when
i
saw
the
fire
when
i
saw
the
building
burning
i
was
sick
i
felt
terrible
and
my
immediate
concern
was
whether
the
children
had
gotten
out
and
whether
they
were
escaping
or
whether
they
were
inside
trying
to
burn
themselves
up
thats
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
know
thank
you
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
it
was
a
janet
reno
decision
isnt
it
in
the
end
your
decision
the
president
well
what
im
saying
is
that
i
didnt
have
a
four
or
fivehour
detailed
briefing
from
the
fbi
i
didnt
go
over
every
strategic
part
of
it
it
is
a
decision
for
which
i
take
responsibility
im
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
signed
off
on
the
general
decision
and
giving
her
the
authority
to
make
the
last
call
when
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
some
time
had
elapsed
she
might
have
made
a
decision
to
change
her
mind
i
said
if
you
decide
to
go
forward
with
this
tomorrow
i
will
support
you
and
i
do
support
her
she
is
not
ultimately
responsible
to
the
american
people
i
am
but
i
think
she
has
conducted
her
duties
in
an
appropriate
fashion
and
she
has
dealt
with
this
situation
i
think
as
well
as
she
could
have
thank
you

of
the

how
do
you
know
that
your
next
door
neighbour
doesnt
like
custard
to
be
spread
over
his
genetalia
then
have
it
licked
off
by
his
wife
is
this
sexual
deviancy
how
do
we
know
that
you
dont
like
something
sexually
which
others
may
find
repulsive
is
having
sex
doggy
fashion
a
sexual
deviancy
please
be
more
specific
and
where
you
do
back
up
your
claims
or
i
may
have
to
go
to
hospital
due
to
laughing
too
much
at
yours
and
claytons
postings
secondly
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
phrase
sexual
deviant
means
such
people
as
homosexuals
bisexuals
c
basically
everyone
you
dont
like
i
think
that
your
phrase
do
not
comprise
a
political
minority
why
the
brackets
is
a
nonsequiteur
gay
groups
exist
which
lobby
their
governments
that
is
a
fact
prove
it
false
hence
they
are
a
politial
group
you
state
that
they
are
not
a
political
minority
are
they
therefore
a
political
majority
i
think
you
boobed
really
big
on
this
one
try
thinking
about
your
arguments
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
i
only
associate
with
girls
who
do
indeed
have
selfrespect
but
were
i
to
find
myself
with
the
sort
who
would
be
inclined
to
head
out
the
door
on
account
of
my
views
regarding
the
aberrant
behavior
known
as
homosexuality
i
would
encourage
her
to
indeed
do
so
and
i
would
further
advise
her
not
to
let
the
door
whack
her
on
the
backside
on
the
way
out
who
needs
such
an
airhead
prove
the
first
statement
please
dates

c
again
your
logic
fails
again
you
make
statements
which
you
cannot
and
most
probably
will
not
maintain
you
state
that
a
person
girl
in
this
context
who
considers
equal
rights
for
all
humans
to
be
an
airhead
as
clayton
your
best

would
say
it
just
shows
how
screwed
up
you
are
pretty
soon
they
will
find
themselves
retreating

they

dont
count

sweetheart
oh
i
cant
do
anything
but
count
on
it
after
all
it
is
inevitable
for
it
is
part
of
the
natural
order
of
things
throughout
history
nature
has
always
asserted
itself
dont
be
so
arrogant
as
to
assume
that
this
foolish
and
misguided
generation
can
change
the
nature
of
man
where
practically
every
other
generation
has
failed
greater
men
than
you
havent
been
able
to
do
this
the
above
most
certainly
will
happen
no
matter
how
much
you
may
wish
to
pretend
otherwise
proof
please
proof
that
homosexuality
is
not
part
of
the

proof
that
nature
has
always
asserted

are

paul
bartholomew
writes
a
very
well
put
together
post
i
disagree
with
several
key
points
but
the
post
is
an
excellent
one
with
which
to
engage
in
discourse
there
has
been
much
discussion
recently
about
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
mr
cramer
and
mr
ronzone
appear
to
take
an
absolutist
position
on
this
rightthat
it
is
a
fundamental
human
right
perhaps
the
fundamental
human
right
and
that
it
supersedes
other
rights
such
as
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
others
feel
that
a
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
thus
we
have
the
neverending
debate
that
flares
up
repeatedly
freedom
of
association
foa
involves
the
mutual
and
voluntary
agreement
of
two
or
more
people
right
to
equal
opportunity
lets
call
it
reo
involves
coercion
in
all
cases
by
definition
a
major
problem
is
that
neither
of
these
rights
are
explicitly
declared
or
protected
in
the
constitution
or
in
the
declaration
of
independence
although
both
can
be
derived
from
these
documents
unfortunately
this
means
that
the
debate
will
never
end
because
neither
side
can
conclu
sively
prove
the
validity
of
their
viewit
becomes
solely
a
matter
of
personal
philosophy
yes
there
is
much
debate
but
no
it
can
end
with
once
and
for
all
recognition
of
these
rights
well
not
totally
perfect
end
but
end
in
the
same
way
that
there
is
no
worldwide
disagreement
that
say
murder
is
a
crime
my
personal
opinion
is
that
the
real
answer
lies
somewhere
in
between
i
regard
both
of
these
rights
as
fundamental
human
rights
which
unfortu
nately
come
into
direct
conflict
with
one
another
which
is
stronger
depends
on
the
given
situation
hmm
there
is
even
more
discusion
about
religion
should
we
take
a
somewhere
in
between
approach
towards
the
state
a
state
recognized
religion
the
first
amendment
is
so
uh
so
absolutist
you
know
for
example
if
the
owner
of
a
momandpop
store
wishes
to
hire
an
employee
to
help
out
their
right
to
freedom
of
association
outweighs
the
rights
of
their
job
applicants
to
an
equal
opportunity
they
should
be
free
to
hire
whomever
they
choose
using
whatever
criteria
they
choose
without
any
government
intervention
at
all
similarly
if
a
family
wishes
to
rent
out
a
bedroom
in
their
home
or
a
garage
apartment
or
something
similar
then
their
right
to
freedom
of
association
outweighs
the
rights
of
their
prospective
tenants
to
an
equal
opportunity
if
on
the
other
hand
ibm
a
multinational
corporation
with
employees
publicly
owned
and
operated
by
a
board
of
directors
wishes
to
hire
additional
employees
then
whose
freedom
of
association
are
we
protecting
the
board
of
directors
the
other
employees
the
owners
of
the
stock
in
this
case
the
applicants
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
we
as
a
society
can
ask
ibm
to
use
only
those
criteria
which
are
relevant
to
the
specific
task
why
says
who
why
can
mon
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forced
and
force
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
as
purchase
of
ibm
is
voluntary
then
there
are
very
well
defined
procedures
on
how
ibm
chooses
to
do
some
things
and
chooses
to
do
other
things
why
not
let
those
same
procedures
work
for
employment
policies
similarly
if
a
landlord
owns
a
number
of
apartment
buildings
in
which
he
does
not
live
and
which
are
managed
by
an
independent
management
agency
then
whose
freedom
of
association
are
we
protecting
if
the
owner
does
not
live
in
his
buildings
and
has
no
contact
with
his
tenants
then
the
prospective
tenants
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
outweighs
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
we
as
a
society
can
ask
the
owner
to
use
only
those
criteria
which
are
relevant
to
good
tenants
ive
put
good
in
quotation
marks
because
i
really
dont
want
to
be
drawn
off
into
the
side
issue
of
what
constitutes
a
good
tenant
why
does
this
tenant
have
an
option
i
wont
call
it
a
right
to
destroy
the
foa
of
the
landlord
if
the
landlord
and
the
tenant
cant
agree
then
they
both
can
cease
from
using
each
others
property
suddenly
by
arm
waving
by
magic
a
landlord
does
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basis
does
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seems
that
vague
terms
like
no
contact
with
tenants
suffice
well
i
think
foa
is
one
our
most
important
rightts
in
the
top
and
by
golly
if
the
state
is
going
to
make
it
suffer
i
sure
would
like
to
see
the
heinous
crime
that
justifies
the
removal
of
this
right
i
dont
think
no
contact
with
the
tenats
is
even
a
crime
much
less
something
that
should
cause
severe
interference
with
important
rights
i
suspect
that
the
majority
of
the
people
in
this
country
agree
with
my
position
on
these
extreme
cases
particularly
if
they
are
presented
in
this
manner
i
dont
know
if
mr
ronzone
or
mr
cramer
would
agreei
suspect
not
in
any
case
additional
problems
arise
when
we
try
to
apply
guidelines
for
the
middle
ground
what
if
the
company
has
employees
or
or
where
do
we
draw
the
line
between
protecting
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
protecting
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
rights
are
not
defined
by
majoritymob
choice
foa
is
an
absolute
reo
is
a
fancy
name
for
thuggery
for
racism
and
coercion
the
difficulty
is
that
any
line
we
draw
will
of
necessity
be
artificial
and
any
legislation
resulting
will
be
flawed
in
the
past
the
government
has
usually
tried
to
pass
laws
which
referred
to
the
number
of
employees
hired
by
the
companyeg
any
company
with
more
than
xxx
employees
was
affected
by
the
law
those
with
fewer
were
unaffected
of
course
it
would
be
you
dimly
see
that
the
line
must
be
artifiacial
because
foa
is
the
only
right
just
like
a
state
religion
you
cant
jsutify
that
either
generally
i
believe
that
if
we
do
not
have
any
regulations
affecting
these
rights
then
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
will
be
stronger
on
the
other
hand
many
of
the
regulations
protect
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
too
much
weakening
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
i
dont
believe
there
is
a
satisfactory
solution
which
will
please
everybody
a
solution
that
i
came
up
with
is
to
use
publicly
owned
vs
privately
owned
as
the
dividing
line
if
the
company
remains
privately
owned
then
the
owners
should
be
free
to
do
whatever
they
want
with
their
company
if
the
company
becomes
publicly
owned
then
the
public
has
a
right
to
ask
the
company
to
submit
to
additional
regulation
why
i
assume
that
when
you
say
publicly
owned
you
are
talking
about
those
quasistate
companys
that
do
not
have
shareholders
the
companies
on
the
fortune
for
example
are
all
privately
owned
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
their
owners
they
have
no
anonymous
unknown
to
them
owners
by
the
way
the
above
analysis
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
right
to
freedom
of
association
and
the
right
to
an
equal
opportunity
are
both
fundamental
human
rights
of
equal
importance
since
this
is
entirely
a
matter
of
faith
not
subject
to
any
proof
i
do
not
choose
to
even
try
to
establish
this
you
either
accept
it
or
you
dont
any
comments
foa
can
be
derived
by
any
two
rational
people
on
a
basis
that
neither
has

malicious
or
murderous
intent
towards

others
in
short
agreement
is
mutual
or
not
at
all
your
reo
on
the
other
hand
lives
only
by
accepting
coercion
the
gun
into
the
situation
and
that
is
selfdestructive
of
the
whole
argument
because
it
is
based
only
on
might
makes
right
sort
of
like
saying
nobody
has
a

i
whip

youre
not

so
much
as
being

no
it
is

as
it
is
optional
for
doctors
to
accept

there
are
isolated
religeous
communities
in

that

and
one
email
from
a

verified
for
me
that
it
is
indeed
negative
option
i
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
there
is
a
right
to
having
a
particular
insurance
but
so
far
ive
not
come
across
that
up
north
and
i
take
pains
to
keep
tabs
with
news
from
home
its
optional
but
what
if
you
dont
want
basic
coverage
on
the
governments
terms
you
said
before
that
if
you
opt
out
youre
basically
uninsured
there
are
two
things
at
work
here
the
public
insurance
is
very
wide
in
what
it
will
cover
as
the
amortization
is
also
universal
no
private
plan
can
boast
of
a
plan
that
fits
a
gaussian
curve
and
as
our
private
sector
has
discovered
theyre
better
off
not
offering
insurance
coverage
that
their
customers
are
going
to
use
and
that
turns
the
private
insurers
offering
the
frills
into
an
effective
cartelthey
dont
really
need
to
compete
because
as
you
put
it
theyre
in
a
winwin
situation
and
theyre
guaranteed
to
turn
a
profit
believe
me
they
probably
had
orgasms
when
they
figured
that
out
and
according
to
my
sister
the
yuppie
they
pat
themselves
on
the
back
to
the
point
of
ungraciousness
at
chamber
of
commerce
luncheons
so
in
a
sense
theyve
stopped
being
truly
capitalists
if
they
dont
have
to
worry
about
competing
anymore
you
might
say
that
the
total
effect
is
one
of
socialized
medicinea
government
providing
the
basics
and
a
cartel
providing
the
extras
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
system
desirable
or
not
the
alternative
to
the
system
is
no
system
at
all
patients
opted
out
doctors
opted
out
or
both
but
that
only
for
insurance
and
you
cant
force
a
private
insurance
company
to
sell
you
a
plan
that
they
will
not
offer
and
remember
that
the
actual
health
care
is
delivered
by
private
entities
who
collect
from
the
public
insurance
voluntarily
again
they
cant
force
a
private
entity
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
plus
there
is
the
matter
of
culture
and
values
im
basically
antitax
and
antigovernment
by
canadian
standards
yet
i
cant
bring
myself
to
make
the
same
arguments
as
you
do
despite
that
i
understand
where
youre
coming
from
up
north
youre
so
much
more
likely
to
find
someone
protesting
taxes
going
to
defence
than
health

well
you
have
to
realize
that
in
our
society
thats
like
saying
that
its
not
really
national
defence
because
you
cant
hire
your
own
rambo
squad
instead
or
even
opting
out
as
a
pacifist
true
but
i
would
be
more
comfortable
with
a
system
in
which
basic
care
provided
by
the
government
was
optional
not
mandatory
in
canada
and
germany
its
not
mandatory
however
it
is
negative
option
in
that
you
must
request
the
exemption
that
the
private
sector
will
not
provide
private
basic
coverage
if
offered
the
option
as
in
the
quebec
case
tells
me
something
about
what
they
know
either
way
the
transient
situations
are
hard
to
deal
with
since
the
changes
in
the
private
medical
care
resource
take
place
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
ability
of
people
to
fall
sick
esp
in
the
light
of
disasters
eg
chernobyl
or
bad
luck
a
sudden
wave
of
heart
disease
a
doctor
needs
years
of
training
plus
internship
and
specialty
training
another
problem
with
the
us
system
that
should
be
resolved
doesnt
canada
have
something
like
ten
times
the
proportion
of
gps
to
specialists
that
the
us
does
yes
but
part
of
the
reason
is
that
our
most
of
our
markets
are
too
small
to
sustain
many
specialists
sometimes
not
even
one
so
you
pretty
well
have
to
be
a
gp
to
get
paid
and
if
you
do
get
the
training
the
doctors
monopoly
might
block
your
getting
of
a
licence
because
there
is
already
someone
in
the
business
and
who
cannot
fill
hisher
appointment
book
that
we
have
a
cma
doctors
monopoly
is
something
that
the
american
amaoriented
medical
lobby
never
tells
you
down
here
the
problem
is
in
a
specialty
your
skill
often
directly
correlates
to
your
pay
a
good
cardiologist
makes
more
than
a
merely
adequate
cardiologist
more
than
it
does
in
general
practice
in
that
circumstance
its
hard
to
blame
people
for
going
into
specialties
no
i
respect
people
who
do
specialties
okay
all
of
my
md
friends
are
but
theres
the
question
of
our
small
market
dynamics
up
north
if
anything
that
our
private
doctors
and
hospitals
sell
their
services
to
americans
to
generate
more
business
will
inflate
their
effective
population
served
and
thus
make
some
specialties
finally
viable
ie
there
will
be
enough
customers
we
just
do
not
have
enough
sick
canadians
in
absolute
numbers
otherwise
i
personally
think
an
approach
like
germanys
would
be
bestwhere
the
companies
compete
for
batches
of
people
rochester
a
little
east
of
us
was
able
to
get
almost
all
of
its
population
covered
that
way
uh
germany
basically
uses
our
method
with
their
many
sickness
funds
the
competition
is
fake
if
it
exists
at
all
because
theyre
all
interlinked
look
in
der
spiegel
or
stern
my
girlfriend
is
in
our
german
department
and
her
uncle
is
a
private
practicioner
in
saarbrucken
no
ads
for
health
insurance
while
canada
organizes
by
province
germany
organizes
the
paperwork
around
big
corporations
and
regional
offices
but
remember
that
we
have
provinces
that
have
the
same
population
as
some
major
german
corporations
germans
have
public
health
insurance
just
that
it
is
brokered
by
smaller
entities
actually
brokerage
of
basic
by
private
firms
wholl
sell
extra
insurance
to
fill
out
their
policies
sort
of
a
voucher
system
was
one
of
the
first
ideas
floated
in
canada
too
remember
the
germans
dont
have
hmos
a
telling
sign
cos
rochester
does
and
theyre
also
a
company
town
but
there
was
a
washington
post
article
recently
about
that
that
said
canadian
doctors
often
use
myelograms
instead
of
mris
which
require
spinal
injections
and
can
cause
seizures
and
headaches
mickey
kaus
in
the
new
republic
probably
spoke
for
most
americans
when
he
said
who
needs
that
i
think
people
here
generally
like
to
believe
they
can
easily
get
the
most
hightech
treatment
even
if
they
really
cant
afford
it
ill
have
to
let
a
canadian
md
jump
in
to
verify
that
claim
but
ive
come
to
learn
to
suspect
anything
in
the
american
press
about
our
system
if
much
or
some
of
it
were
true
youd
have
to
take
us
for
idiots
for
tolerating
it
and
given
that
our
insurance
was
installed
during
a
period
when
there
were
only
liberal
and
tory
governments
federally
and
provincially
and
the
socialists
are
still
chafing
they
wouldve
pressed
for
real
socialized
medicine
to
fix
things
think
about
it
after
all
we
are
using
the
us
as

to
make

such

has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back
down
from
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
since
that
only
encourages
other
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
not
an
accurate
analogy
david
koresh
did
not
take
a
bunch
of
hostages
and
then
call
the
batf
with
a
ransom

you
make
it
sound

the

i
have

for

absolutely
no

cases
it
seems
to
me
that
the
batf
showed
up
took
the
davidians
hostage
then
the
fbi
showed
up
negotiated
to
have
a
few
of
the

released

were

keep

dont

what
you

close
off
the

around
a

they

it

gary
l
dare
writes
again
they
cant
force
a
private
entity
to
spring
to
life
to
pay
them
so
the
government
by
sheer
economic
force
has
basically
cleared
the
basiccare
market
for
itself
the
only
way
to
test
this
would
be
for
some
really
daring
person
to
start
up
from
scratch
in
alberta
andor
quebec
a
health
insurance
company
offering
basic
care
crazy
yes
but
thats
almost
how
mci
got
started
however
the
concept
of
risks
is
well
known
by
insurance
actuaries
and
no
private
firm
can
get
the
kind
of
amortization
that
the
public
pools
can
get
and
since
health
insurance
gets
spent
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
the
insurance
ceos
and
you
get
a
situation
like
in
the
us
where
rates
keep
going
up
to
catch
up
see
what
i
mean
its
a
government
monopoly
sure
because
its
a
nonmarket
phenomenom
and
the
free
market
cant
solve
it
even
our
private
insurance
says
that
and
remember
last
year
quebec
proposed
giving
the
least
risky
parts
of
basic
care
to
the
private
sector
and
they
balked
like
you
saidwhy
should
they
and
wants
no
part
of
it
by
your
own
arguments
if
you
dont
want
the
provincial
plan
youre
basically
up
a
creek
yes
but
in
our
culture
arguing
against
it
is
like
arguing
for
national
defence
by
means
of
warlords
true
according
to
polls
ive
read
usually
in
the
sort
of
simpleminded
stuff
you
were
initally
responding
to
something
like
of
americans
would
like
canadianstyle
health
care
whereas
only
of
canadians
would
like
it
our
way
id
be
interested
to
know
why
there
are
that
many
of
canadas
population
is
about
a
million
or
so
people
canada
is
saturated
by
american
media
while
pundits
come
on
cable
and
talk
about
how
awful
our
health
care
is
supposed
to
be
what
people
experience
up
north
ends
up
not
differing
from
what
they
see
portrayed
on
american
television
in
movies
ie
same
infrastructure
different
insurance
makeup
yet
they
know
not
of
any
insurance
problems
and
have
no
idea
of
what
an
hmo

the
polls
that
you
refer
to
for
the
canadian
data
are
from
the
annual
july
polls
conducted
for
macleans
our
major
english
newsmagazine
by
decima
research
decima
president
allen
gregg
is
considered
one
of
the
worlds
top
poll
researchers
and
mulroneys
conservatives
have
relied
on
him
to
keep
in
power
in
the
face
of
impossible
election
situations
the
american
polls
are
harris
polls
and
have
been
reposted
on
usenet
a
few
times
and
probably
will
again
im
sorta
suspicious
myself
cos
maybe
americans
want
universal
coverage
like
canada
i
honestly
doubt
that
most
americans
realize
that
we
have
private
doctors
and
public
and
private
hospitals
ie
similiar
health
care
infrastructure
and
our
system
is
basically
pure
insurance
without
hmos
given
recent
turnarounds
by
the
hiaa
endorsing
universal
coverage
and
hostility
to
corporatist
hmos
within
the
ama
and
the
complete
silence
vis
a
vis
canadabashing
by
the
ama
i
suspect
that
theyre
keeping
the
secret
about
canada
up
their
sleeve
exactly
wouldnt
you
until
the
idea
of
managed
competition
arose
there
was
no
direct
threat
to
standalone
private
practice
in
the
the
ama
fought
hmos
as
corporatized
socialist
medicine
part
of
the
reason
why
we
have
only
insurance
and
no
hmos
in
canada
cos
that
was
part
of
the
deal
cut
with
the
cma
ive
also
read
that
the
three
biggest
american
hmos
can
be
compared
straight
up
against
some
of
the
smaller
canadian
provinces
in
the
maritimes
and
they
spend
something
like
less
per
patient
maybe
it
does
help
the
american
hmos
can
still
cream
and
they
probably
cover
a
smaller
geographic
area
than
even
our
smallest
provinces
geography
again
some
of
them
are
spread
out
across
the
whole
country
i
think
but
each
site
is
probably
compact
and
the
clientele
are
creamed
and
dont
forget
that
hmos
place
caps
on
your
coverage
and
often
wont
tell
you
about
additional
procedures
you
could
get
otherwise
despite
that
you
might
be
willing
to
pay

one
need
not

swallow
the

just
because
one
grants
the
benefits
of
allowing
anyone
who
wishes
to

services
without

does
not
mean
that
the

should
be
free
to
bleed
people
as
a
medical
service
without
government
intervention
as
somemany
libertarians
would
argue
on
a
case
by
case
basis
the
costbenefit
ratio
of
government
regulation
is
obviously
worthwhile
the
libertarian
agenda
however
does
not
call
for
this
assessment
it
assumes
that
the
costs
of
regulation
of
any
kind
always
outweigh
its
benefits
this
approach
avoids
all
sorts
of
difficult
analysis
but
it
strikes
many
of
the
rest
of
us
as
dogmatic
to
say
the
least
i
have
no
objection
to
an
analysis
of
medical

provide
a
more
effective
efficient
means
of
accomplishing

objectives
than
is
provided
through

being

excellently
put
even
as
a

i
have
to
admit
government
does
do
some
things
i
like
there
is
a
beautiful
performing
arts
complex
in
ft
lauderdale
that
was
partially
built
with
tax
dollars
i
dont
know
how
much
was
private
and
how
much
was
stolen
i
mean
public
but
it
is
beautiful
and
i
enjoy
it
keep
in
mind
though
most
of
the
people
in
the
city
will
never
attend
a
single
performance
there
so
they
might
feel
differently
about
having
to
help
pay
for
it
however
i
have
to
disagree
about
it
being
desireable
or
efficient
to
give
government
interventionpower
on
a
casebycase
basis
in
fact
we
have
a
lot
better
luck
maintaining
our
freedom
of
speech
precisely
because
it
is
not
decided
on
a
casebycase
basis
as
much
as
other
issues
judges
decide
whether
political
speech
is
allowed
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
they
do
not
try
to
decide
just
whether
pronazi
prochoice
prolife
or
protax
political
speech
should
be
allowed
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
you
can
imagine
the
result
if
right
to
free
speech
was
decided
by
the
majority
on
a
casebycase
basis
not
so
with
economic
issues
government
does
tell
taxidrivers
exactly
what
they
can
charge
but
not
the
bus
lines
or
the
lawyers
just
as
it
is
not
desireable
to
decide
rights
of
free
speech
on
a
casebycase
basis
we
should
not
decide
rights
to
free
enterprise
on
a
casebycase
basis
there
is
hope
that
a
government
can
be
restricted
from
interferring
with
free
enterprise
but
there
is
no
hope
in
my
opinion
of
having
a
government
that
interferes
with
free
enterprise
in
an
efficient
manner
i
call
it
political
market
failure
thus
if
you
value
freedom
and
the
abundance
it
produces
you
have
to
swallow
the
whole
libertarian
agenda

cant

ted
notes
not
everyone

one
might
find
oneself
as
i
did
in

anticipating
expenses
in

require

the
choice

waiting
a

with

only
a

would
choose
the

not
disputed
the
fact
that
brett
can
now
construct
post
hoc
calculations
of
what
would
have
been
more
beneficial
to
investors
is
in
many
respects
beside
the
point
there
was
plenty
of
moneystyle
advice
given
to
unsophisticated
investors
in
late
to
sell
now
and
save
on
taxes
in
case
anyone
missed
it
there
was
no
shortage
of
similar
advice
late
last
year
in
the
nytimes
eg
even
though
that
advice
was
based
not
on
the
foregone
conclusion
of
enacted
law
as
in
but
merely
on
the
assumption
that
clinton
would
raise
tax
rates
without
capping
cg
taxes
contrary
to
the
current
proposal
it
works
for
any
situation
if
you
believe
the
market
is
going
up
dont
sell
if
believe
its
not
sell
but
then
youd
be
selling
anyways
wouldnt
you
so
where
is
the
evidence
that
a
large
number
of
people
suddenly
decided
that
the
higher
taxes
meant
they
should
sell
before
the
year
was
out
there
isnt
any
teds
saying
that
the
increase
over
the
previous
year
is
proof
of
that
proposition
but
im
saying
you
cant
know
that
the
trend
of
increasing
capital
gains
revenues
wouldnt
account
for
a

of

was
the

the

is

vats
they

suggest

tax
rates
and
at
a
rate
sufficient
to
give
the

enough

for

the
republicans
are
in
general
fighting
any
tax
increase
there
is
also
worry
that
a

be

too
easy
to

btw
what
is

between
canadas

most
of

it

force
an
agreement
with
the
democrats
that
the
top
income
tax
rate
would
then
be
frozen
for
the
forseeable
future
and
could
be
increased
only
via
a
national
referendum
this
would
require
a
constitutional
amendment
and
congress
enjoys
raising
taxes
too
much
to
restrict
themselves
like
that
besides
with
the
majority
necessary
to
pull
that
off
youd
have
a
difficult
time
forcing
anything

that
why
not
make
use
of
the
clintons
to
do
something
worthwhile
shift
the
tax
burden
from
investment
to
consumption
and
get
health
care
reform
and
a
frozen
low
top
marginal
tax
rate
all
in
one
fell
swoop
primarily
because
its
a
practical
impossibility
to
freeze
tax
rates
however
this
is
something
that
bothers
me
were
always
talking
about
consumer
confidence
and
consumer
spending
as
gauges
for
the

if
they

this

i

even

im

i

is
wholly

absolutely
so
the
response

is
take
us
even
further
into

duh
what
else
would
you
expect
a

no
your

my

my
were
getting
personal
the
only
subculture
i
see
dominating

is
money
if
youll
buy
it
theyll
sell
it
and
as
recent
movements
to
boycott
tv
advertisers
have
shown
theyre
very
sensitive
about
what
sells
whatever
happened
to
personal
responsibility
anyway
or
am
i
personally
responsible
for
the
decline
in
that
too
to
the
extent
that
people
have
been
encouraged
to
not
be
responsible
for
themselves
yes
a
just
when
and
where
have
i
encouraged
people
not
to
be
responsible
for

be
specificbut
do
make
up
random
dates
and
heinous
acts
as
you
see
fit
b
you
and
i
have
encouraged
many
people
to
do
many
things
how
does
that
in
any
way
make
our
audiences
less
responsible
for
their
actions
is
there
a
finite
amount
of
responsibility
so
cf
conservation
of
energy
as
i
become
more
responsible
for
an
occurrence
by
encouraging
it
the
actual
perpetrator
becomes
correspondingly
less
so
at
what
point
does
the
perpetrator
become
completely
innocent
altogether
you

male
sex
survey
gay
activity
low
a
new
natonal
study
on
male
sexual
behavior
the
most
thorough
examination
of
american
mens
sexual
practices
published
since
the
kinsey
report
more
than
four
decades
ago
shows
about
percent
of
the
men
surveyed
had
engaged
in
homosexual
sex
and
percent
considered
themselves
exclusively
homosexual
the
figures
on
homosexuality
in
the
study
released
wednesday
by
the
alan
guttmacher
institute
are
significantly
lower
than
the
percent
figure
that
has
been
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
since
it
was
published
in
the
kinsey
report
so
what
so
there
are
less
gays
then
the
gays
claim
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
reaction
when
queers
gather
in
washington
dc
after
all
if
there
are
only
of
us
then
this
is
an
event
unprecidented
in
history
dream
on
abortion
and
africanamerican
civil
rights
rallies
dont
even
bring
in
half
of
that
the
article
also
contains
numbers
on
the
number
of
sexual
partners
the
median
number
of
sexual
partners
for
all
men
was
dont
forget
that
had
or
more
partners
i
was
wondering
why
i
wasnt
getting
laid
compared
to
the
table
i
have
already
posted
from
masters
johnson
and
kolodny
showing
male
homosexual
partners
it
is
apparent
that
homosexual
men
are
dramatically
more
promiscuous
than
the
general
male
population
and
what
did
this
study
show
for
number
of
sexual
contacts
for
those
who
said
they
where
homosexual
or
is
that
number
to
inconvient
for
you
if
its
more
then
who
cares
its
a
shame
that
we
dont
have
a
breakdown
for
straight
men
vs
gaybi
men
that
would
show
even
more
dramatically
how
much
more
promiscuous
gaybi
men
are
fuck
off
actually
i
bet
you
more
gaybi
men
are
as
not
as
promiscuous
as
gay
men
because
more
of
them
could
have
the
option
of
living
a
straight
life
and
with
social
pressures
probably
would
at
least
try
join
the
pythagorean
reform
church
repent
of
your
evil
irrational
numbers
and
bean
eating
ways
accept
into
your
heart
call
the
pythagorean

bbs
at
did
you
know
that
is
is
a
fact
that
homosexuality
was
comparatively
high
in
hitlers
storm
troopers
sa
before
he
came
to
power
i
wonder
if
they
got
to
put
the
triangles
on
themselves
ryan

re
new
study
out
on

the

also
contains

the

isnt
is
funny
how
someone
who
seems
to
know
nothing
about
homosexuality
uses
a
very
flawed
imho
source
of
information
to
pass
jusgement
on
all
homosexual
and
bisexual
men
only
the
most
comprehensive
survey
on
sexuality
in
years
it
would
seem
more
logical
to
say
that
since
the
heterosexual
group
of
men
is
larger
then
the
chances
of
promiscuity
larger
as
well
in
my
opinion
orientation
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
chance
and
size
have
nothing
in
common
on
the
multimillion
number
scale
we
are
talking
about
men
are
men
and
they
all
like
sex
i
am
a
gay
male
i
have
had
sex
three
times
in
my
life
all
with
the
same
man
before
that
i
was
a
virgin
so
whose
promiscuous
nobody
said
that
you
were
chill
just
because
someone
is
gay
doesnt
mean
they
have
no
morals
just
because
someone
is
heterosexual
doesnt
mean
they
do
look
at
the
world
well
said
statistics
alone
prove
that
most
criminals
are
by
default
hetero
actually
the
kinsley

high

this
was
in

the

bombarded

in
some
senators

states
with
news
releases
warning
that
certain

may
not
be

if
the

isnt

none
of

are

in

rather
they
are
part
of
a
wish
list
that
may
be
funded
from
the

community

end
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
a
bunch
of
clintonites
going
on
and
on
raving
about
how
dishonest
it
was
that
the
rebublicans
were
taking
items
from
this
wish
list
in
order
to
ridicule
this
bill
now
that
clinton
is
using
that
same
list
in
order
to
garner
support
for
the
bill
are
you
guys
going
to
do
the
honorable
thing
and
say
that
clinton
is
being
dishonest
as
one
of
the
clintonites
cited
above
ill
try
to
clarify
since
this
is
not
a
case
of
clintons
dishonesty
i
wont
necessarily
defend
him
on
other
issues
there
were
never
any
specific
projects
included
in
the
community
development
block
grant
portion
of
the
presidents
proposal
congressional
republicans
in
an
effort
to
discredit
the
stimulus
package
selected
what
they
felt
were
silly
sounding
projects
from
a
wishlist
of
potential
projects
prepared
by
the
us
mayors
conference
before
the
stimulus
package
was
ever
proposed
the
document
in
question
was
designed
to
pressure
the
white
house
to
increase
the
size
of
the
block
grant
proposal
submitted
to
congress
it
didnt
work
the
billion
proposed
in
the
stimulus
package
came
nowhere
close
to
covering
the
total
estimated
cost
of
the
original
wishlist
if
it
were
passed
communities
would
have
to
select
which
projects
to
fund
and
at
what
level
in
the
case
of
spokane
wa
tom
foleys
home
district
no
one
ever
expected
to
be
able
to
refurbish
a
local
swimming
pool
one
of
the
republicans
examples
from
the
funds
available
in
the
stimulus
package
since
the
estimated
cost
of
doing
so
exceeded
the
total
amount
of
block
grant
funds
the
city
would
receive
from
the
stimulus
package
for
all
projects
the
plan
instead
was
to
use
the
money
on
public
housing
construction
and
remodeling
to
cope
with
a
severe
housing
shortage
yup
there
are
places
where
that
is
true
the
swimming
pool
improvements
were
near
the
bottom
of
a
long
list
of
priorities
prepared
by
the
city
the
million
or
so
to
be
received
would
cover
only
a
few
of
the
most
pressing
priorities
if
the
block
grants
are
cut
from
the
stimulus
package
it
is
these
projects
that
will
be
affected
by
the
lack
of
funds
and
that
is
why
the
clinton
administration
has
been
publicizing
the
issue
a
final
point
one
may
or
may
not
like
community
block
grants
it
is
worth
noting
however
that
congressional
republicans
opposition
to
them
is
new
since
the
nixon
administration
republicans
have
generally
supported
such
grants
as
an
alternative
to
targeted
federal
spending
arguing
that
local
governments
are
far
better
able
to
determine
spending
priorities
than
washington
bureaucrats
is
it
clear
now
or
is
this
all
too
complicated

understand

the

certainly

for

i

at

its

but
i
think
you
miss
the
point
its
not
about

its
about
supporting

helping

leading

a
possible

very
possible
scenario
one
of
the

caused
some

punched

kerosene
spilled
onto
this

material
resulting
in
a
fire
that
killed
people

you
must

than
i
did
while
the
smoke
did

from

place
initially
it
was
a
considerable
distance
from

and
in
a
very
short
time
fire
appeared
at
several
places
a
good
distance
apart
from
there
then
theres
that
nagging
question
about
why
out
of
all
those
people
only
a
few
made
any
attempts
to
escape
or
save
the
children
if
it
were
me
with
my
child
and
i
wasnt
committing
suicide
i
believe
i
would
have
made
some
attempt
to
at
least
save
the
child
as
it
was
at
least
one
of
the
survivors
was
attempting
to
go
back
into
the
fire
when
they
were
physically
removed
no
one
lifted
a
finger
to
bring
out
a

apparently
how
do
you
explain
that
and
the
two
survivors
who
claimed
to
have
doused
the
place
with
lantern
oil
and
set
the
fire
no
doubt
on
davids
orders
at

until
the
lawyers
talked
to
them
tim
and
also
why
have
they
not
yet
released
the

that
is
a
good
question
maybe
because
it
would
be
a
further
embarrassment
seeing

motorvoter
stuff
my
friend
after
the
election
brought
up
the
point
that
it
would
enable
more
people
to
vote
however
since
it
makes
it
easier
to
get
to
the
place
of
registration
he
brought
up
the
analogy
that
if
there
were
only
one
place
to
vote
say
in
alaska
would
it
be
excessive
and
wasteful
to
petition
to
have
more
places
to
vote
this
is
a
similar
idea
a
way
to
encourage
more
people
to
vote
by
making
it
more
easily
accessible
i
not
knowing
where
i
stood
played
devils
advocate
and
said
well
would
you
have
the
taxpayers
money
go
to
busing
for
those
people
that
have
trouble
making
it
to
dmv
then
where
does
the
right
to
vote
merge
with
the
right
to
vote
easily
where
should
we
draw
the
lines
well
there
does
have
to
be
a
line
and
to
be
honest
extending
voter
registration
to
dmvs
is
hardly
analogous
to
having
only
one
place
for
registration
in
alaska
and
opening
a
new
one
in
atlanta
more
is
not
always
better
once
youve
passed
a
certain
point
my
friend
said
that
that
is
obviously
an
extreme
and
that
actually
the
motorvoter
bill
would
save
money
because
no
longer
would
the
city
have
to
pay
someone
to
sit
in
the
town
hall
and
spend
all
hisher
time
filing
those
things
theyd
just
be
at
the
push
of
a
button
or
the
filling
out
of
an
x
at
dmv
so
i
actually
someone
else
but
theres
no
need
to
confuse
this
anymore
countered
again
saying
that
wouldnt
congress
as
always
get
exorbitent
budgets
and
fund
committees
to
orchestrate
and
oversee
the
implementation
the
argument
went
back
and
forth
forever
ranging
from
whether
or
not
its
better
to
have
more
people
voting
whether
that
is
even
relevant
etc
just
looking
for
some
more
opinions
anybody
got
em
i
thought
the
motor
voter
bill
passed
in
any
case
my
experiance
with
tennessees
voter
registration
system
which
you
can
register
with
by
mail
by
the
way
is
that
nobody
who
is
interested
in
voting
is
being
denied
access
to
registration
all
it
requires
is
just
the
tiniest
bit
of
interest
on
the
registrants
part
and
thinking
about
the
election
once
in
the
eleven
months
prior
to
it
once
you
register
its
good
unless
you
miss
for
years
worth
of
elections
of
move
its
easy
to
register
now
i
simply
dont
see
the
value
in
going
out
and
trying
to
get
people
registered
who
dont
have
enough
gumption
to
even
write
and
have
the
proper
forms
sent
to
them
how
can
we
expect
responsible
decisions

the

the
parliamentary
assemby
of
the
european

have
been
elected
directly
by
the
citizens
of
the

states
before
the
members
of
the
european

meps
were
just
members
of
national
parliaments
mnps
elected
by
and
from
among
their
peers
in
the
european
parliament
every
member
state
has
a
fixed
number
of
seats
which
increases
less
than
proportionally
with
the
population
once
in
five
years
a
general
european
election
is
being
held
in
which
the
citizens
of
all
member
states
choose
their
representatives
to
the
european
parliament
next
elections
are
due
in
now
the
voting
system
for
these
european
elections
still
differs
from
one
country
to
another
although
the
european
treaty
enabling
the
direct
election
of
the
meps
requires
a
uniform
voting
system
up
to
now
every
country
has
just
used
its
own
system
more
or
less
the
same
one
used
for
national
elections
british
meps
are
elected
in
a
firstpastthepost
system
with
one
mep
per
district
nearly
all
other
states
have
chosen
a
system
with
proportional

but
then
in
some
countries
france
italy
meps
are
allowed
to
be

whilst
in

they
are
not
belgium
netherlands
the
european
parliament
is
now
working
on
a
uniform
election
system
for
its
own
members
so
that
every
candidate
should
have
the
same
regulations
to
comply
with
regardless
of
the
member
state
she
wants
to
be
elected
for
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
people
out
there
think
of
the
following
questions
do
you
think
it
is
necessary
to
have
uniform
regulations
or
should
every
member
state
continue
to
use
its
own
regulations
for
european
elections
that
is
do
you
think
a
system
of
majority
voting
should
be
implemented
with
one
or
more
meps
per

or
would
you
prefer
a
system
with

for

per

or
should

treaty

do

if

do
you

should
be

or
a

parliament
too
or
a
member
of

or
regional
government
body
the

now
has
meetings
in
both
strasbourg
and
brussels
meps
themselves
are
for
a
complete
move
to
brussels
in
great
majority
but
political
compromises
between
the

of
the

stick

i
ask
this
question
because
there
is
a
tradition
and
one
that
is
highly
regarded
by
many
people
that
several
hundred
jews
elected
to
throw
themselves
off
a
cliff
at
masada
rather
than
submit
to
roman
rule
the
circumstances
at
masada
and
those
at
waco
would
seem
in
general
terms
quite
similar
and
yet
so
far
as
im
aware
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
the
jews
were
insane
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
jews
faced
a
totally
different
fate
at
the
hand
of
the
romans
than
did
koresh
at
the
hand
of
the
feds
the
jewish
men
would
most
likely
have
been
crucified
the
the
women
and
children
sold
into
slavery
one
can
well
argue
that
koresh
may
have
thought
that
a
similar
fate
awaited
him
but
there
was
scant
rational
basis
for
that
fear
so
insane
seems
to
describe
any
such
belief
what
is
the
penalty
if
convicted
of
murdering
federal
agents
in
texas
the
death
penalty
none
of
which
excuses
the
reckless
action
of
the
feds
who
allegedly
believing
they
were
dealing
with
a
nut
should
have
exercise
much
more
restraint
indeed
given
their
stated
goals
of
saving
the

one
might
also
apply
the
moniker
insane

the

tanks
were
rolling
all
around
how
did
the

coordinate
the
setting
of

its
fairly
simple
it
was
decided
to
burn
the
place
down
and
more
than
one
agent
was
dispatched
to
set
the
fires
in
separate
parts
of

i
doubt
that
simultaneously
means
at
the
exact

time
in
this
case
it
likely
means
close
enough
together
to
preclude
them
from
being
part
of
the
same
fire
the
fbi
claims
that
men
with
torches
set
the
fires
but
havent
released
any
evidence
of
this
though
it
seems
inconcievable
that
they
dont
have
any
if
it
was
true
they
might
be
waiting
until
the
evidence
comes
in
from
the
site
and
the
investigation
is
at

well
underway
all
of
the
bds
previous
actions
were
aimed
towards
their
survival
not
their
death
the
same
could
be
said
of
jonestown
the
idea
that
kerosene
lamps
would
be
all
over
the
place
with
electricity
cut
off
makes
sense
the
idea
that
ramming
tanks
into
the
building
would
spill
them
and
cause
a
fire
makes
sense
the
possibility
that
the

wouldnt

this
is
nil
it
wasnt

that
has

are

having

no

the

the

post
it
otherwise
try

stick

factual
assertions
and
as
the

implied
it
is
private

whose

only
those
that

now
thats
an

defense
of
the

system
are
you
contending
that
it

government
intervention
that
prevents
private

companies
from
standardizing
in

it
is
true
that
some
of
the

stems
from
the
lack
of

among
the

private

its

well
aware
there
are
alot
of
people
who
condemn
it
as
a
result
the
gay
population
is
not
encouraged
to
develop
nonpromiscuous
relationships
in
fact
there
are
many
roadblocks
put
in
the
way
of
such
committed
relationships
it
is
as
if
the
heterosexual
community
puts
these
blocks
there
so
as
to
perpetuate
the
claim
that
gays
are
immoral
my
if
we
allowed
gays
to
marry
raise
children
we
might
just
find
out
theyre
as
moral
as
we
are
cant
have
that
can
we
just
some
thoughts
flame
away
dan
this
is
a
very
good
point
one
that
i
have
held
for
sometime
we
do
not
allow
people
to
develop
on
the
paths
that
they
choose
or
desire
even
with
heterosexuals
we
tend
to
leave
some
hanging
in
the
sense
of
knowledge
and
information
about
sexuality
and
relationships
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
young
person
to
develop
and
build
a
positive
view
of
themself
when
they
are
constantly
being
told
implicitly
and
explicitly
that
they
are
wrong
and
immoral
the
concepts
about
personal
relationships
are
deeply
embedded
in
emotionalism
and
fear
these
fears
cover
a
wide
range
but
mostly
jealousy
and
lack
of
trust
seem
to
be
cornerstones
of
modern
day
american
relationships
we
also
set
on
top
of
this
the
concepts
of
madison

attractiveness
and
standards
and
put
the
pressure
on
to

greg

university

it
is
obvious
that
mr

has
the
ability
to
take
the
leap
of
faith
i
have
listened
to
several
of
the
men
involved
in
this
study
and
even
they
claim
that
the
men
involved
will
not
tell
the
whole
truth
i
put
little
value
in
extrapolating
from
these
types
of
studies
or
surveys
they
have
limited
subsets
of
individuals
and
there
is
alot
of
skewing
due
to
improper
selection
methods
and
the
bias
of
the
people
involved
in
the
studies
on
both
sides
subject
and
researcher
would
you
admit
to
be
part
of
a
group
that
was
not
very
well
liked
would
you
admit
to
having
had
sex
with
other
people
at
some
considered
abnormal
rate
this
applies
to
heterosexual
men
in
fact
as
one
gay
man
and
one
straight
man
put
it
men
lie
about
the
number
of
partners
because
thats
the
thing
to
do
our
culture
for
the
male
almost
requires
this
type
of
response
it
may
seem
harmless
and
silly
but
carries
a
large
emotional
and
mental
price
tag
i
hear
college
male
students
everyday
talking

their
supposed

they
just
have

also

newer

then
theres
the

side
an

in

stated
that
there
are
many

who
have
misgivings
that
the

being
used
to
determine
whether

not
global

is
occuring
is
faulty
the
point
that
the

made
is
that
all
long

temperature
dataa
collected
has
been
in
urban

and
that
any
heat
rise
can
be
attributed
to
the

of

they
called
it

we

the

for
that

an

developed
a
method
for

to

globally
and
that
preliminary
results
showed
a

attributed

it
went

that
even

that

it
was
actions
in
pursuit
of
that
end
that
he
was
pardoned
for
you
of
course
are
so
ignorant
of
history
that
you
think
that
he
was
involved
in
the
break
in
i
guess
that
makes
you
even
dumber
than
me
then
because
he
was
officially
accused
of
alot
more
than
that
let
me
list
it
for
you
obstructing
justice
as
part
of
the
coverup
granted
abusing
his
presidential
powers
to
do
the
coverup
only
in
part
lets
not
forget
that
nixon
personally
authorized
the
breakin
of
ellsbergs
psychiatrist
subverting
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
i
challenge
you
to
provided
any
evidence
that
nicon
was
officially
accused
of
thi
if
nothing
else
its
meaningless
how
can
you
subvert
someones
constitutional
rights
the
verb
doesnt
go
with
the
noun
tell
that
to
the
house
that
was
the
charge
or
are
you
going
to
challenge
me
on
that
as
well
subverting
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
has
nothing
to
do
with
coveringup
for
watergate
you
have
been
proved
wrong
again
but
i
dont
expect
you
to
believe
this
since
your
arrogance
has
replaced
your
reason
and
willfully
disobeying
lawful
subpoenas
for
white
house
records
and
tapes
part
of
the
coverup
granted
garrett
please
note
that
every
charge
you
mention
except
for
the
one
that
has
no
english
meaning
was
part
of
the
coverup
wrong
again
you
forgot
about
ellsberg
btw
why
od
you
think
he
tried
to
cover
it
up
loyalty
to
people
who
worked
for
him
this
would
be
funny
if
it
werent
so
sad
that
you
actually
believe
this
in
his
loyalty
he
allowed
the
people
who
worked
for
him
to
take
the
rap
while
he
idly
sat
by
and
let
it
happen
if
he
really
was
loyal
to
the
people
who
worked

he
would
have

you
all

one
of

nixon
didnt

this
is

nixon
had
full

invasions
of
laos
and
cambodia
and
then
lied
to
the
american
public
about
it
note
however
that
these
were
military
actions
but
not
wars
what
a
joke
you
cant
actually
believe
what
you
just
said
can
you
we
bombed
and
invaded
these
countries
notice
the
definition
of
war
from
the
american
heritage
dictionary
a
state
or
period
of
armed
conflict
between
nations
or
states
this
qualifies
the
invasions
of
cambodia
and
laos
as
wars
one
of
you
said
nixon
didnt
use
the
office
of
the
presidency
for
personal
gain
this
is
a
lie
the
senate
committee
issued
an
indictment
that
listed
nixons
crimes
the
relevant
ones
were
violating
his
oath
of
office
abusing
his
presidential
powers
excuse
me
but
neither
of
these
refer
to
personal
gain
then
let
me
explain
this
to
you
really
slowly
why
did
he
abuse
the
powers
of
his
position
could
it
have
been
to
gain
personal
political
power
naw
that
would
be
too
obvious
so
now
youre
big
thing
that
you
have
been
flogging
me
with
is
that
i
mistook
prc
for
peoples
republic
of
cambodia
since
i
knew
that
cambodia
was
socialist
at
the
time
and
since
your
comment
was
right
in
middle
of
a
conversation
about
cambodia
i
made
the
wrong
assumption
that
we
were
talking
about
the
same
thing
ah
but
garrett
anyone
who
has
to
make
assumptions
about
the
meaning
of
the
initials
prc
in
a
discussion
about
asia
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
anyone
who
can
only
call
names
because
his
position
is
defensless
is
breathtakingly
ignorant
and
desperate
i
noticed
that
you
edited
out
the
other
points
were
i
proved
you
and
phil

be
completely
wrong

still

firearms
a

justifies
nothing

under

a

warrant
justifies
a

the

constitution
does
not

murder

a
search
for
illegally
held

if
there
were
any
no
evidence
yet
produced
to
this
effect
does
not
justify
firing
into
a
house
with
women
and
children
either
it
also
does
not
justify
shooting
first
without
identifying
oneself
the
atf
and
fbi
have
done
this
before
so
dont
say
they
havent
please
or
producing
a
warrant
guess
it
depends
on
whose
story
one
believes
huh
it
took
them
days
to
think
of
a
basic
terrorist
tactic
ie
tear
gas
and
this
could
only
be
justified
in
support
of
rescuing
any
supposed
hostages
inside
the
govt
has
a
right
to
use
lethal
force
in
certain
cases
attempts
to
capture
dangerous
criminals
who
are
armed
and
threatening
the
lives
of
others
which
others
are
we
talking
about
here
is
one
in
this
case
they
used
sub
lethal
force
sub
lethal
excuse
me
but
those
people
are
dead
the
govt
immediately
imprisoned
these
socalled
hostages
the
children
were
held
hostage
evidence
so
far
the
fbi
has
produced
none
dont
hold
your
breath
the
adults
were
wanted
variously
for
murder
and
conspiracy
to
murder
only
a
few
of
those
being
held
in
chains
and
shackles
are
wanted
the
rest
are
being
held
for
the
crime
of
being
material
witnesses
it
took
hundreds
of
govt
agents
with
taxfunded
cellular
phones
ten
minutes
to
dial
for
the
fire
department
they
should
not
have
called
the
fire
dept
at
all
there
was
no
role
for
them
to
play
in
a
situation
where
those
that
might
be
rescued
might
well
shoot
at
them
it
was
not
the
feds
decision
to
make
but
the
firefighters
calling
the
fire
dept
meant
that
waco
was
deprived
of
a
resource
that
might
have
been
needed
elsewhere
should
a
situation
where
it
could
have
been
used
arisen
this
is
true
of
any
answer
to
a
call
for
help
from
a
fire
department
by
any
citizen
since
fire
departments
do
answer
calls
that
deprive
resources
that
might
be
needed
elsewhere
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
for
not
calling
them
further
since
the
davidians
had
not
been
found
guilty
of
any
crime
in
a
court
of
law
they
are
subject
to
the
same
protection
as
any
other
citizen
and
las
far
as
i
know
even
criminals
in
prison
are
not
left
to
burn
to
death
in
a
fire
by
cutting
off
the
water
supply
in
the
surrounding
area
the
govt
guaranteed
that
any
fire
at
the
compound
would
be
fatal
any
fire
started
deliberately
uising
lamp
oil
is
likely
to
be
fatal
i
guess
this
is
a
matter
of
religious
faith
with
you
the
government
says
it
so
it
must
be
so
or
havent
you
been
reading
this
thread
well
enough
to
notice
that
some
of
us
here
dont
beleive
their
story
no
one
had
the
foresight
to
station
rescue
vehicles
nearby
in
the
first
place
they
are
a
scarce
resource
a
bunch
of
psychos
cannot
deprive
the
neighbourhood
of
a
resource
that
might
be
required
in
a
genuine
case
patients
in
psychiatric
hospitals
are
not
left
to
die
in
fires
either
besides
as
i
explained
some
of
us
here
believe
their
distress
might
have
been
genuine
are
you
so
certain
it
wasnt
the
govt
conveniently
forgot
all
that
freedom
of
religion
stuff
freedom
of
religion
does
not
include
human
sacrifice
nor
does
it
include
other
forms
of
murder
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
davidians
committed
human
sacrifice
either
before
of
after
the
initial
raid
and
selfdefense
is
not
murder
the
govt
arguably
started
or
at
least
fanned
the
fire
themselves
the
govt
arguably
is
run
by
communists
or
the
trilateral
commission
he
did
not
say
it
was
deliberate
accidents
do
not
require
conspiracy
theories
only
wanton
disregard
for
human
life
the
initial
raid
alone
agents
firing
blind
into
walls
against
all
standards
of
law
enforce
ment
procedure
proves
they
did
not
mind
killing
people
finally
and
this
may
be
a
stretch
for
some
of
you
statists
out
there
but
koreshs
original
reasons
for
holing
up
in
such
a
compound
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
continual
interference
from
the
govt
new
taxes
new
regulations
and
increasing
involvement
in
every
aspect
of
our
personal
and
economic
lives
life
on
a
compound
might
become
the
way
of
the
future
it
might
have
to
be
let
us
hope
that
those
who
support
koresh
are
not
allowed
to
enforce
this
upon
the
rest
of
us
no
one
here
is
supporting
koresh
we
are
opposing
the
illegal
use
of
excessive
violence
by
our
government
against
our
citizens
that
is
all
their
reasons
for
supporting
the
ownership
of
high
power
weaponry
are
clear
enough
they
hope
that
this
will
be
the
catylist
for
the
destruction
of
the
fabric
of
society
and
allow
them
to
enforce
their
nightmare
vision
of
the
future
a
society
that
believes
it
is
ok
to
terrorize
people
for
their
religious
views
will
destroy
itself
in
due
time
it
is
the
feds
who
disrupted
the
fabric
of
society
in
waco
not
koresh
it
is
the
feds
who
forced
a
nightmare
onto
the
people
of
mount
carmel
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
people
to
study
history
on
what
basis
do
you
assume
we
havent
dont
you
really
mean
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
people
drew
the
same
conclusions
from
history
that
i
do
in
particular
a
group
of
militant
militant
implies
acts
of
aggression
against
ones
neighbors
the
davidians
left
their
neighbors
alone
religious
heretics
who
left
to
set
up
such
a
community
some
time
ago
a
few
years
latter
they
had
captured
medina
and
destroyed
the
idols
in
the
kabba
within
ten
years
the
whole
of
arabia
was
under
islam
so
what
the
mormons
were
considered
a
cult
for
years
and
were
chased
out
of
one
place
after
another
on
much
the
same
thinking
as
you
are
advocating
when
they
finally
got
to
set
up
a
community
they
left
people
alone
so
far
americans
havent
been
put
to
the
sword
by
mormon
hordes
crying
to
avenge
joseph
smith
just
because
a
group
of
people
start
by
saying
that
all
they
want
is
to
be
left
alone
does
not
mean
that
that
is
how
they
will
stay
it
doesnt
mean
they
wont
either
anyway
the
whole
purpose
of
a
system
of
laws
is
to
punish
people
for
what
they
do
not
what
they
might
do
the

robertsons
oral
roberts
and
jimmy
swaggarts
of
this

are
quite
telling
other
people
how
to

telling
is
not
the
same
as
forcing
when
the
police
knock
at
my
door
i
cannot
make
them
go
away
by
changing
the
channei
as
for
pat
and
friends
i
dont
even
watch
their
channel
since
i
am
an
atheist
so
far
not
watching
them
tell
me
what
to
do
hasnt
gotten
me
killed
if
you
allow
such
people
to
get
guns
and
point
them
in
your
face
you
are
likely
to
find
that
they
are
running
your
life
right
now
the
only
people
sticking
guns
in
anyones
faces
is
the
government
and
they
are
trying
very
hard
to

my

patrick
kearney
writes
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
branch
davidian
people
immolated
themselves
in
the
manner
described
by
the
federal
authorities
why
does
the
general
consensus
appear
to
be
that
they
the
bd
were
insane
is
it
the
manner
of
their
behaviour
before
they
died
or
the
fact
they
chose
to
kill
themselves
rather
than
submit
to
the
government
i
ask
this
question
because
there
is
a
tradition
and
one
that
is
highly
regarded
by
many
people
that
several
hundred
jews
elected
to
throw
themselves
off
a
cliff
at
masada
rather
than
submit
to
roman
rule
the
circumstances
at
masada
and
those
at
waco
would
seem
in
general
terms
quite
similar
and
yet
so
far
as
im
aware
nobody
has
seriously
suggested
that
the
jews
were
insane
the
point
of
this
comparison
is
to
question
the
use
of
the
word
cult
in
discussing
the
events
at
waco
why
were
the
davidians
a
cult
and
not
the
jews
at
masada
what
constitutes
a
cult
is
it
the
size
of
the
membership
or
a
matter
of
respectability
or
perhaps
the
length
of
time
its
been
in
existence
are
the
catholics
a
cult
how
about
the
mormons
or
the
calvinists
is
a
sect
a
respectible
cult
dictionary
definitions
aside
since
popular
usage
seems
to
carry
more
weight
i
suspect
that
the
word
cult
is
used
in
a
perjorive
sense
when
speaking
of
groups
like
the
davidians
it
is
rather
like
the
word
boss
when
used
to
describe
someone
unpopular
or
someone
the
government
wishes
to
make
unpopular
like
say
castro
the
communist
boss
of
cuba
one
doesnt
hear
clinton
described
as
americas
democratic
or
capitalist
boss
well
for
one
thing
most
if
not
all
the
dividians
depending
on
whether
they
could
show
they
acted
in
selfdefense
and
there
were
no
illegal
weapons
could
have
gone
on
with
their
life
as
they
were
living
it
no
one
was
forcing
them
to
give
up
their
religion
or
even
their
legal
weapons
the
dividians
had
survived
a
change
in
leadership
before
so
even
if
koresch
himself
would
have
been
convicted
and
sent
to
jail
they
still
could
have
carried
on
i
dont
think
the
dividians
were
insane
but
i
dont
see
a
reason
for
mass
suicide
if
the
fire
was
intentional
set
by
some
of
the
dividians
we
also
dont
know
that
if
the
fire
was
intentionally
set
from
inside
was
it
a
generally
know
plan
or
was
this
something
only
an
inner

knew

was
it
something
two

three
felt

i

missing
the
entire
point
of
my
post
wrote
given
that
the
trade
in
illegal
drugs
is
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
which
afflicts
our
nation
there
is
much
evidence
that
it
is
the
fact
that
the
drugs
are
illegal
not
the
drugs
themselves
that
have
caused
the
violence
witness
prohibition
and
the
violence
that
surrounded
the

no
joke
people
who
want
drugs
particularly
people
who
are
predisposed
to
addiction
will
find
a
way
to
get
them
whether
or
not
they
are

this
is

as

how
to
accomplish
the

good
of
discouraging

use
without
violating
individual
rights
despite
current

efforts
drugs
are

to
those
who

this

no
youmissed
the
point
the
point
is
the
war
on
drugs
is
a
failure
and
is
counterproductive
addiction
to
drugs
boh
legal
and
illegal
is
responsible
for
a
significant
drain
on
the
productive
resources
of
our
country
and
this
occurs
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
the
cocaineaddicted
babies
who
are
unable
to
learn
to
the
spread
of
disease
among
addicts
to
the
tragic
consequences
of
alcohol
abuse
and
tobacco
smoking
the
crack
baby
scenario
has
been
thouroughly
discredited
it
just
so
happens
that
the
symptoms
seen
in
the
crack
babies
are
identical
to
fetal
alcohol
syndrome
and
the
mothers
who
admitted
to
taking
crack
also
admitted
to
drinking
heavily
during
pregnancy
in
this
country
people
are
free
to
be
stupid
if
they
want
to
but
they
are
not
free
to
be
stupid
and
injure
other
people
admittedly
the
fetal
righttolife
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
discussion
however
its
ridiculous
to
assert
as
you
apparently
do
that
cocaine
hasno
effecton
the
developing
fetal
nervous
system
caffiene
and
nicotine
have
fetal
effects
too
why
should
cocaine
be
any
exception
a
general
economic
principle
of
government
is
that
whatever
is
subsidized
you
get
more
of
and
whatever
is
taxed
you
get
less
of
to
be
most
effective
in
confronting
the
nations
drug
problem
some
way
must
be
found
to
utilize
these
additional
powers
of
government
to
make
drug
dealing
and
drug
use
less
attractive
so
make
the
drugs
legal
tax
them
and
use
the
tax
money
to
fund
a
program
to
tell
people
how
studid
drugs
are
it
has
worked
for
the
legal
drugs
if
you
had
read
my
article
before
writing
your
kneejerk
response
you
would
have
seen
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
advocated
while
this
countrys
current
efforts
to
combat
legal
drugs
have
succeeded
in
some
respects
there
is
a
greater
awareness
of
the
health
consequences
of
smoking
and
designateddriver
programs
have
helped
reduce
drunk
driving
for
example
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
the
war
on
illegal
drugs
there
remains
a
core
group
of
illegal
drug
users
which
support
international
networks
of
smugglers
pushers
growers
processors
kingpins
and
gangsters
these
networks
and
their
marketing
activities
which
include
drive
by
shootings
corrupting
law
enforcement
authorities
and
smuggling
weapons
are
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
crimes
committed
in
our
country
every
day
each
and
every
one
of
these
problems
is
a
direct
result
of
the
drug
trade
being
illegal
no
shit
sherlock
clearly
illegal
drugs
and
rising
crime
are
linked
it
takes
only
a
moments
reflection
to
recognize
how
they
are
linked
the
link
is
money
as
with
this
countrys
failed
effort
to
prohibit
alcohol
consumption
a
black
market
has
been
created
in
which
greedy
local
monopolies
like
the
gangsters
of
a
bygone
era
have
profited
enormously
from
their
illegal
trade
the
victims
of
this
trade
include
not
only
the
innocent
people
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
in
the
crossfire
but
i
would
argue
the
drug
users
themselves
a
great
argument
for
making
drugs
legal
thank
you
how
could
you
have
missed
the
point
so
utterly
whathaveyou
been
smoking
here
then
is
my
proposal
possession
and
use
of
all
presently
illegal
drugs
is
decriminalized
but
buying
and
selling
them
remains
illegal
potheads
can
grow
their
own
marijuana
as
many
already
do
today
other
drug
users
can
legally
import
their
poison
of
choice
as
long
as
they
pay
the
tariffs
and
a
barter
economy
of
drug
experimenters
develops
your
solution
has
done
nothing
to
eliminate
the
violence
in
the
drug
trade
btw
how
is
someone
going
to
import
a
drug
if
buying
it
is
illegal
i
think
you
need
to
think
your
solution
through
a
little
more
thouroughly
obviously
importers
will
not
be
buying
drugs
in
the
us
under
us
jurisdiction
use
your
remaining
brain
cells
because
of
the
barter
economy
which
supplies
the
drug
users
the
black
market
profits
that
have
so
enriched
the
drug
lords
dwindle
if
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
why
buy
them
nevertheless
there
will
be
those
who
will
seek
to
sell
these
noncommercial
drugs
even
at
relatively
low
prices
therefore
you
have
failed
to
indicate
how
these
drugs
can
be
obtained
for
free
or
next
to
nothing
you
have
stated
that
the
sale
of
them
is
illegal
ok
ill
spell
it
out
for
you
barter
economy
means
that
drug
users
will
be
permitted
to
grow
or
synthesize
chemically
anything
they
choose
or
to
buy
it
outside
the
us
and
bring
it
in
if
it
wont
grow
here
they
will
also
be
permitted
to
trade
with
other
drug
users
for
drugs
other
than
the
ones
they
themselves
grow
or
manufacture
they
will
not
however
be
able
to
legally
sell
their
drugs
for
money
both
manufacture
and
importation
of
noncommercial
drugs
will
be
taxed
to
discourage
their
use
this
is
your
brain
on
drugs
any
questions
law
enforcement
activity
is
concentrated
on
those
individuals
who
continue
to
buy
and
sell
and
also
on
the
crimes
committed
by
drug
users
too
poor
to
afford
even
low
prices
but
here
is
where
the
strategy
begins
to
differentiate
between
the
drug
dealers
the
victimizers
and
the
drug
users
their
victims
in
most
cities
this
is
already
the
strategy
it
has
already
failed
and
is
dragging
the
rest
of
us
down
with
it
pardon
me
but
possessionuse
of
these
drugs
is
still
a
crime
you
cannot
analogize
the
rates
at
which
drug
users
would
seek
treatment
and
the
comparative
ease
with
which
it
could
be
made
available
today
when
these
drugs
are
illegal
to
possessuse
with
what
it
would
be
were
theynotillegal
to
possessuse
decriminalizing
possession
and
use
makes
treatmentmucheasier
drug
dealers
are
exploiting
the
weaknesses
of
those
persons
who
are
prone
to
addiction
and
as
such
the
drug
users
should
be
left
alone
not
thrown
in
prison
along
with
their
victimizers
drugdealersare
the
criminals
and
should
be
treated
as
such
drug
addiction
does
not
absolve
you
of
responsiblity
for
your
criminal
actions
however
upon
arrest
foranycrimesuspects
are
permitted
to
choose
whether
or
not
they
will
undergo
a
drug
test
those
who
choose
to
cooperate
are
informed
that
upon
conviction
for
the
crime
they
are
accused
of
if
they
are
found
to
be
a
drug
user
they
will
be
institutionalized
until
they
are
clean
and
only
then
will
they
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
if
they
choose
to
cooperate
and
are
already
drugfree
they
can
begin
to
serve
their
sentence
right
away
those
who
choose
not
to
undergo
the
drug
test
and
are
convicted
face
stiffer
fines
and
serve
longer
sentences
this
sounds
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
self
incrimination
which
is
unconstitutional
if
drug
use
is
legal
in
your
scheme
why
should
the
presence
of
drugs
in
anyones
system
influence
the
penalty
they
receive
much
too
big
brotherish
for
my
tastes
the
drug
test
of
an
arrested
suspect
is
voluntary
not
coerced
and
does
not
therefore
constitute
violation
of
amendment
v
those
convicted
who
are
drug
users
as
evidenced
by
the
test
are
in
need
of
treatment
for
their
problem
institutionalization
of
these
adddicted
criminals
is
i
would
argue
the
best
way
to
help
them
straighten
out
if
they
refuse
the
test
and
are
convicted
their
sentence
can
be
appropriately
harsher
since
they
unlike
the
addict
have
no
excuse
for
their
crimes
institutionalization
of
drug
using
criminals
serves
several
purposes
drug
using
criminals
and
this
includes
drunk
andor
stoned
drivers
are
separated
from
their
sources
of
supply
thus
reducing
the
total
number
of
drug
users
in
society
at
large
and
consequently
decreasing
the
demand
for
drugs
on
the
street
putting
more
of
the
remaining
drug
dealers
out
of
business
why
should
drug
using
criminals
be
treated
any
different
from
other
criminals
you
have
already
stated
that
drug
use
is
legal
markwilsonatlantagancrcom
why
not
my
objective
is
to
discourage
drug
useandcriminal
behavior
if
fewer
criminals
do
drugs
out
of
fear
of
getting
a
harsher
sentence
if
they
are
convicted
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing
if
fewer
drug
dealers
who
are
still
criminals
btw
can
find
victims
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing
if
fewer
drug
users
such
as
drunks
potheads
etc
commit
crimes
out
of
fear
of
being
cut
off
from
their
sources
of
supply
why
is
that
not
a
good
thing

certainly

if

ordain
and

im
surprised
you
missed
it
its
right
there
in
the
first
paragraph
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
made
it
at
least
through
the
preamble
you
almost
got
it
right
and
it
was
a
good
try
but
you
should
follow
your
own
advice
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
does
read
as
you
have
quoted
but
let
us
not
forget
that
after
all
it
is
only
the
preamble
it
is
not
a
binding
part
of
the
constitution
and
carries
no
weight
in
the
law
that
poor
tortured
paragraph
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
passages
in
the
english
language
witness
the
legions
of
blowhards
like
yourself
who
think
those
vague
flowery
phrases
are
part
of
the
law
of
the
land
do
you
really
believe
that
a
politician
only
has
to
give
lip
service
to
promoting
the
general
welfare
to
be
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
sorry
buddy
but
some
other
blowhards
managed
to
include
the
general
welfare
in
another
portion
of
the
constitution
article
i
section
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxesto
pay
the
debts
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
and
general
welfare
of
the
united
states
i
guess
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
understood
they
meant
what
they
said
in
the
preamble
just
to
make
sure
youve
got
the
point
lets
do
a
little
experiment
what
if
the
constitution
read
as
follows
preamble
we
the
people
to
promote
the
general
welfare
do
ordain
and
establish
this
constitution
for
the
united
states
of
america
constitution
the
federal
government
shall
have
one
function
and
one
function
only
to
provide
for
the
defense
of
the
nation
the
government
would
not
then
have
two
functions
defense
and
welfare
but
since
it
explicitly
includes
both
the
general
welfare
and
defense
in
article
i
section
i
guess
youll
grant
that
botha
are
constitutional
functions
right
steve
im
glad
to
see
that
you
abandoned
the
preamble
thing
what
did
you
do
a
word
search
to
find
welfare
somewhere
else
in
the
constitution
my
comments
and
paraphrases
in

article
i
section
in
some
ways
the
guts
of
the
constitution
the
congress
shall
have
the
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
to
pay
the
debts
indebtedness
as
defined
in
the
document
and
provide
for
the
common
defence
defence
as
precisely
defined
and
general
welfare
as
defined
through
the
document
mostly
in
ways
that
limit
the
government
of
the
united
states
but
the
above
taxes
shall
be
uniform
through
out
the
us
so
far
the
congress
has
been
given
the
power
to
collect
taxes
uniformly
then
to
borrow
money
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
interstate
and
indian
tribes
to
do
uniform
naturalization
and
bankruptcies
to
coin

regulate

to

your
original
instinct
was
right
looking

that

we

but
obviously
the
situation
there
is
very
serious
q
has
he
called
janet
reno
today
or
yesterday
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes
spoken
to
her
today
q
why
does
he
have
nothing
to
say
about
this
publicly
except
on
the
piece
of
paper
that
was
put
out
last
night
at
pm
ms
myers
he
did
he
answered
a
question
about
it
yesterday
q
before
anything
had
happened
ms
myers
before
anything
happened
he
put
out
q
since
something
has
happened
hes
had
nothing
to
say
ms
myers
hes
put
out
a
statement
on
it
last
night
and
well
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
today
q
in
what
forum
is
that
going
to
be
ms
myers
it
will
be
at
the
photo
in
the
rose
garden
q
he
will
talk
about
waco
at
that
ms
myers
yes
hell
have
something
to
say
q
is
that
something
we
can
take
live
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
be
brief
we
can
talk
a
little
later
about
the
exact
structure
as
we
work
it
out
but
i
dont
know
if
its
something
youd
want
to
take
live
q
will
he
take
questions
on
waco
at
that
time
as
well
ms
myers
hell
probably
take
a
few
q
is
there
any
reason
why
he
hasnt
talked
to
the
attorney
general
ms
myers
ill
have
to
doublecheck
i
dont
know
that
he
hasnt
talked
to
her
this
morning
q
and
she
didnt
come
here
this
morning
to
see
him
or
anyone
else
ms
myers
no
q
and
he
didnt
talk
yesterday
q
whats
the
reaction
to
her
resignation
statement
that
she
made
last
night
ms
myers
she
was
asked
a
question
about
it
and
she
answered
the
question
the
president
has
absolutely
no
intention
of
asking
for
the
attorney
generals
resignation
he
stands
behind
her
percent
as
you
know
he
was
informed
about
the
decision
he
takes
full
responsibility
for
that
and
stands
percent
behind
attorney
general
reno
q
the
question
now
arises
yesterday
we
were
told
that
he
was
briefed
on
this
but
we
never
got
a
firm
idea
of
how
much
he
knew
of
what
the
plan
was
and
the
justification
for
the
plan
and
the
justification
of
the
timing
was
he
fully
informed
on
all
of
that
all
of
this
about
the
increasing
levels
of
violence
inside
the
compound
that
made
them
want
to
go
now
the
feeling
that
nothing
else
was
going
to
succeed
et
cetera
ms
myers
he
talked
with
the
attorney
general
about
the
decision
about
she
talked
to
him
about
the
factors
that
led
to
her
decision
he
raised
no
objections
he
supports
her
decision
to
go
forward
with
it
he
was
fully
briefed
q
of
course
hindsight
is
but
looking
back
now
does
the
president
does
the
white
house
feel
that
the
decision
he
signed
off
on
proved
to
be
the
right
way
to
go
when
you
look
at
what
actually
happened
ms
myers
i
think
everybody
feels
bad
when
life
is
lost
but
i
dont
think
that
that
is
reason
to
secondguess
the
decision
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
was
made
he
was
informed
about
it
he
was
fully
briefed
about
it
and
he
stands
percent
behind
the
attorney
general
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
its
a
difficult
operation
and
theres
it
had
already
gone
on
for
more
than
seven
weeks
four
federal
agents
had
lost
their
lives
in
the
line
of
duty
lets
not
forget
that
this
was
a
very
difficult
situation
and
all
the
decisions
involved
were
very
difficult
but
all
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
fbi
the
justice
department
all
recommended
moving
forward
with
this
they
thought
given
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
possible
course
of
action
theres
just
no
point
in
second
guessing
those
decisions
now
i
think
that
theres
a
reason
q
why
not
they
have
to
ms
myers
no
not
to
secondguess
the
decisions
i
think
its
important
to
take
a
look
at
it
to
have
an
investigation
i
think
the
president
will
talk
some
about
that
later
today
but
at
this
from
this
vantage
point
to
secondguess
those
decisions
its
not
useful
q
you
sound
like
hes
going
to
order
an
investigation
of
what
happened
and
whether
ms
myers
i
think
hell
have
more
to
say
about
that
later
yes
q
he
will
order
an
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
yes
hell
have
more
to
say
about
an
investigation
q
what
kind
of
investigation
ms
myers
hell
have
more
to
say
about
it
later
q
but
in
the
monday
morning
quarterbacking
surely
there
is
some
soulsearching
now
as
to
whether
it
was
the
right
decision
you
cant
say
that
we
did
the
best
we
could
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
rather
a
debacle
ms
myers
i
think
well
obviously
well
review
the
situation
and
all
the
factors
that
lead
to
a
very
tragic
outcome
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
that
the
outcome
was
tragic
but
again
the
president
stands
behind
the
decisions
that
were
made
and
well
take
a
look
at
the
factors
that
contributed
to
that
q
what
was
the
fbi
directors
role
in
this
ms
myers
well
he
was
obviously
involved
in
setting
up
the
operation
he
signed
off
on
it
as
did
the
agents
that
were
on
the
ground
that
were
working
with
him
i
dont
believe
he
spoke
to
the
president
but
ill
doublecheck
that
q
but
he
was
very
closely
involved
in
every
aspect
of
planning
and
so
forth
ms
myers
i
would
refer
you
to
the
fbi
on
exactly
what
aspects
he
was
involved
with
q
will
janet
reno
be
coming
over
to
the
white
house
today
ms
myers
theres
no
planned
meeting
i
dont
believe
that
shell
be
here
q
she
wont
be
at
this
event
at
pm
ms
myers
no
no
plans
to
be
q
do
you
think
that
theres
going
to
be
a
jumping
on
on
the
part
of
political
opposition
to
make
something
out
of
this
in
terms
of
to
the
presidents
detriment
politically
ms
myers
well
i
would
certainly
hope
that
people
wouldnt
try
to
use
this
tragedy
for
political
reasons
obviously
i
think
again
that
its
useful
to
look
at
the
facts
to
reevaluate
the
facts
and
i
think
the
president
will
move
forward
with
that
but
i
think
people
understand
that
this
was
a
difficult
series
of
decisions
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
situation
that
it
was
caused
by
a
man
who
was
a
cult
leader
who
was
involved
in
the
death
of
four
federal
agents
and
i
think
its
most
tragic
that
a
lot
of
innocent
children
lost
their
lives
in
this
i
dont
think
anybody
disputes
the
tragedy
of
the
outcome
q
dee
dee
what
was
the
white
house
role
in
handling
the
i
guess
public
relations
aspect
in
the
aftermath
who
was
talking
who
here
at
the
white
house
was
talking
with
people
at
justice
to
set
up
renos
news
conference
to
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
ms
myers
i
think
the
attorney
general
handled
her
end
of
the
situation
herself
and
made
the
decision
to
go
ahead
with
the
news
conference
once
there
was
a
point
at
which
there
was
enough
information
i
think
to
talk
with
some
accuracy
about
what
had
transpired
during
the
day
obviously
people
here
at
a
number
of
levels
were
keeping
in
touch
with
people
at
the
justice
department
and
at
the
fbi
to
try
to
keep
informed
about
what
was
happening
there
q
but
reno
said
that
she
didnt
talk
to
the
president
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
indication
she
hadnt
talked
to
anybody
at
the
white
house
so
who
ms
myers
there
were
people
talking
on
a
staffto
staff
level
q
i
understand
but
who
at
the
justice
department
was
handling
that
for
reno
who
was
talking
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
there
were
a
number
of
people
as
you
know
webb
hubbell
is
the
liaison
to
the
white
house
and
i
know
he
talked
to
a
number
of
people
here
there
were
a
number
of
people
at
a
number
of
different
levels
involved
i
dont
want
to
get
into
exactly
who
had
what
conversations
with
whom
but
there
were
a
number
of
conversations
obviously
the
justice
department
was
working
to
keep
the
white
house
informed
the
press
informed
to
the
best
of
its
ability
as
events
unfolded
throughout
the
day
q
did
webb
hubbell
talk
to
the
president
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
i
dont
know
if
he
talked
he
may
have
at
one
point
q
and
was
the
white
house
role
just
to
seek
information
about
what
happened
or
was
it
to
direct
the
public
information
campaign
that
followed
ms
myers
it
was
both
to
keep
abreast
of
the
situation
so
the
president
could
be
on
top
of
it
but
i
think
the
justice
department
managed
its
press
relations
on
it
we
were
obviously
very
interested
in
what
was
happening
there
throughout
the
day
and
the
president
was
following
it
very
closely
throughout
the
day
q
dee
dee
on
that
though
if
the
president
was
following
it
so
closely
and
he
had
talked
the
night
before
with
janet
reno
why
wouldnt
he
talk
to
her
at
all
since
then
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
if
hes
talked
to
her
this
morning
again
hes
kept
fully
aware
of
what
has
been
going
on
throughout
the
day
he
stands
percent
behind
her
decisions
hes
been
fully
supportive
of
her
as
he
said
yesterday
morning
before
events
transpired
and
yesterday
afternoon
in
a
written
statement
q
but
wouldnt
he
want
to
convey
those
thoughts
to
her
personally
yesterday
ms
myers
one
more
time
i
dont
know
if
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
no
yesterday
q
clearly
theres
a
perception
that
she
was
left
hung
out
to
dry
all
day
yesterday
ms
myers
thats
just
not
true
i
think
we
said
throughout
the
day
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
that
he
stands
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
the
president
stands
foursquare
behind
the
attorney
general
on
this
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
the
events
that
transpired
he
believes
that
janet
reno
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
acted
as
best
they
could
given
the
circumstances
and
the
facts
that
were
evident
at
the
time
i
dont
know
what
else
he
can
say
to
show
that
he
supports
her
percent
q
one
of
the
best
indications
of
that
is
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
tell
her
ms
myers
again
i
dont
know
whether
theyve
spoken
this
morning
q
why
cant
we
find
out
ms
myers
well
we
can
i
cant
do
it
standing
here
right
now
q
youve
got
six
people
here
all
theyve
got
to
do
is
pick
up
the
phone
ms
myers
helen
well
get
back
to
you
q
dee
dee
when
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
is
it
safe
to
assume
that
either
she
volunteered
or
he
inquired
about
whether
there
was
a
possible
downside
to
increasing
pressure
on
the
davidians
ms
myers
i
think
that
they
discussed
the
situation
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
the
specific
details
of
what
exactly
she
told
him
but
i
think
that
he
was
aware
of
the
risks
involved
q
dee
dee
the
president
yesterday
morning
said
it
was
entirely
her
decision
she
then
said
that
she
told
him
what
was
happening
and
he
said
okay
does
the
president
regard
it
that
he
gave
the
goahead
or
that
she
gave
the
goahead
ms
myers
i
think
what
they
both
said
yesterday
was
that
she
made
a
decision
based
on
all
the
available
facts
she
informed
him
about
that
and
he
raised
no
objections
again
i
dont
know
how
much
clearer
we
can
be
about
that
q
and
he
said
okay
the
issue
is
over
the
responsibility
ms
myers
he
said
okay
q
does
okay
mean
ms
myers
the
president
accepts
ultimate
responsibility
q
dee
dee
the
presidents
investigation
that
hes
going
to
announce
would
that
be
conducted
by
someone
outside
the
administration
ms
myers
no
q
it
would
be
internal
is
it
meant
to
preclude
any
congressional
investigation
ms
myers
no
its
meant
simply
to
follow
up
on
the
incidents
that
occurred
yesterday
q
and
you
would
i
assume
therefore
cooperate
fully
with
any
congressional
hearings
that
would
be
held
ms
myers
to
the
best
of
our
ability
q
dee
dee
there
are
two
reports
out
this
morning
one
that
the
justice
department
or
fbi
or
whomever
apparently
had
a
bug
planted
inside
the
complex
and
the
other
is
that
the
children
may
have
been
injected
with
some
kind
of
poison
that
may
have
either
left
them
unconscious
or
maybe
even
killed
them
before
the
fire
what
do
you
know
about
those
two
ms
myers
nothing
more
than
ive
seen
in
news
accounts
this
morning
we
may
get
more
on
it
later
but
at
this
point
i
know
im
not
sure
anybody
knows
any
more
than
what
was
reported
by
people
who
came
out
of
the
compound
q
has
the
president
received
any
report
today
in
terms
of
fatalities
and
actually
what
was
going
on
what
theyve
been
able
to
find
out
on
in
the
compound
now
ms
myers
hes
been
briefed
i
dont
think
that
theyve
gotten
into
the
compound
yet
they
were
still
waiting
for
it
to
cool
off
i
dont
think
theres
much
beyond
whats
been
reported
in
the
news
accounts
but
he
has
been
kept
uptodate
on
it
q
dee
dee
the
president
stands
behind
attorney
general
reno
but
does
he
feel
that
she
perhaps
got
bad
advice
from
the
socalled
experts
ms
myers
he
believes
that
she
made
he
stands
behind
the
decision
that
she
made
it
was
the
unanimous
decision
of
her
advisors
of
the
fbi
of
the
agents
on
the
ground
and
he
supports
that
q
what
about
the
validity
of
the
decisions
made
on
the
ground
does
he
back
those
ms
myers
hes
not
going
to
secondguess
decisions
made
q
dee
dee
you
just
said
he
stands
behind
the
decision
which
she
made
normally
in
a
situation
like
this
the
president
says
i
made
the
decision
but
youre
saying
she
made
the
decision
ms
myers
im
saying
that
the
president
was
briefed
about
the
decision
he
okayed
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
for
it
q
but
then
why
do
you
keep
using
the
terminology
the
decision
that
she
made
rather
than
the
decision
that
he
made
ms
myers
because
as
he
said
yesterday
she
evaluated
the
facts
based
on
evidence
presented
to
her
by
justice
department
and
fbi
which
is
part
of
the
justice
department
and
made
a
decision
and
then
briefed
the
president
on
that
decision
that
is
how
the
chain
of
command
works
she
briefed
him
he
signed
off
on
it
the
operation
went
forward
and
the
president
accepts
full
responsibility
q
in
that
chain
of
command
analogy
there
i
want
to
go
back
to
sessions
a
moment
do
you
know
if
this
was
a
plan
that
came
through
him
to
reno
or
was
it
presented
to
her
around
him
or
with
his
involvement
what
was
his
involvement
ms
myers
again
youd
have
to
go
to
the
justice
department
for
the
specific
interaction
between
the
attorney
general
and
the
director
q
does
the
president
stand
behind
director
sessions
ms
myers
he
supports
again
i
dont
know
how
many
different
ways
i
can
say
this
he
supports
the
decisions
made
by
the
justice
department
and
the
fbi
he
fully
supports
the
attorney
general
in
this
im
not
stepping
away
from
the
director
of
the
fbi
i
want
to
but
janet
reno
is
the
one
who
briefed
him
the
one
who
made
the
decisions
as
the
head
of
the
justice
department
as
you
know
the
director
of
the
fbi
reports
to
the
attorney
general
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
she
informed
the
president
about
those
decisions
he
okayed
it
he
didnt
raise
any
objections
to
it
and
he
accepts
full
responsibility
q
do
you
have
based
on
what
you
know
here
at
the
white
house
any
concerns
about
william
sessions
performance
during
this
ms
myers
nothing
to
suggest
that
no
q
along
those
same
lines
just
in
your
initial
review
of
the
situation
how
much
do
you
think
the
problems
might
have
come
from
not
having
a
justice
department
thats
fully
staffed
and
having
an
fbi
director
who
is
still
quite
uncertain
about
his
status
ms
myers
i
just
dont
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
the
agents
on
the
ground
the
operation
went
forward
im
not
going
to
speculate
on
that
q
did
the
white
house
express
any
alarm
that
janet
reno
chose
to
speak
to
the
live
network
media
before
she
chose
to
speak
to
clinton
ms
myers
no
she
was
carrying
forward
her
responsibility
to
inform
the
public
about
the
events
of
yesterday
i
think
she
did
a
very
admirable
job
the
president
agrees
with
that
q
before
sunday
how
often
was
the
president
briefed
on
the
situation
in
waco
ms
myers
he
was
kept
updated
on
a
regular
basis
on
a
daily
basis
q
who
briefed
the
president
ms
myers
well
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
what
conversations
he
had
with
whom
but
he
was
kept
uptodate
on
the
events
in
waco
he
has
daily
briefings
on
a
number
of
issues
q
no
no
was
this
a
regular
briefing
conducted
by
a
white
house
staff
person
or
was
it
by
a
justice
department
person
ms
myers
hes
briefed
regularly
by
a
white
house
staff
on
a
number
of
issues
again
im
not
going
to
get
into
exactly
who
briefs
him
on
what
subjects
q
another
subject
q
on
another
subject
q
now
were
going
to
do
gays
in
the
military
laughter
ms
myers
i
welcome
it
q
how
close
are
you
to
signing
the
biodiversity
treaty
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
presidents
giving
a
speech
on
earth
day
tomorrow
well
have
more
to
say
about
it
then
q
any
details
on
where
or
when
that
speech
is
yet
ms
myers
its
at
am
and
i
dont
know
where
yet
q
dee
dee
is
this
a
major
policy
address
how
would
you
characterize
the
speech
tomorrow
ms
myers
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
earth
day
speech
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
major
departures
from
his
past
positions
on
these
things
but
again
i
dont
want
to
get
too
much
into
what
hes
going
to
talk
about
tomorrow
q
on
or
off
campus
q
is
this
at
a
location
outside
the
white
house
ms
myers
it
will
be
somewhere
in
washington
we
dont
know
exactly
where
yet
q
dee
dee
what
foreign
leaders
has
the
president
talked
to
since
friday
on
the
situation
in
bosnia
ms
myers
only
prime
minister
major
and
again
hell
try
to
reach
president
mitterrand
again
this
morning
q
david
owen
said
yesterday
and
joe
biden
said
today
both
of
them
agree
that
the
peace
process
is
not
going
to
work
that
the
serbs
are
not
going
to
sign
on
does
the
administration
still
believe
that
it
can
work
and
that
they
will
sign
on
ms
myers
obviously
the
ultimate
goal
is
some
sort
of
peaceful
resolution
to
the
conflict
in
bosnia
as
you
know
the
administration
is
considering
a
wide
variety
of
options
at
this
point
the
situation
there
in
and
around
srebrenica
and
the
rest
of
eastern
bosnia
is
quite
serious
and
the
president
will
meet
with
his
bosnian
advisors
today
and
continue
to
press
forward
on
this
q
is
that
a
question
theyre
going
to
try
to
be
deciding
whether
or
not
the
peace
plan
remains
viable
ms
myers
again
theyll
be
reviewing
a
number
of
options
including
the
peace
plan
q
does
the
group
that
hes
meeting
with
today
include
reg
bartholomew
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
hes
here
but
it
will
be
among
the
usual
secretary
christopher
secretary
aspin
general
powell
q
dee
dee
do
you
have
anything
on
the
apparent
encounter
by
us
over
bosnia
today
some
aircraft
violating
the
nofly
zone
ms
myers
no
i
dont
ill
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
will
the
president
be
meeting
with
every
one
of
the
leaders
coming
to
town
for
the
holocaust
museum
ms
myers
he
will
hell
be
meeting
as
you
know
with
vaclav
havel
today
and
with
lech
walesa
tomorrow
and
then
with
the
rest
of
the
group
tomorrow
afternoon
q
as
a
group
or
one
by
one
ms
myers
i
believe
its
as
a
group
now
havel
and
walesa
asked
for
meetings
early
and
these
have
been
on
the
agenda
for
quite
some
time
but
he
will
meet
with
all
of
the
foreign
heads
of
state
that
are
here
q
dee
dee
has
the
president
decided
whether
he
supports
the
gay
and
lesbian
civil
rights
act
and
has
anything
been
worked
out
for
him
to
address
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
i
think
hell
probably
have
a
letter
or
some
kind
of
a
statement
to
the
march
we
havent
worked
out
the
exact
details
of
that
q
not
a
live
phone
hookup
ms
myers
probably
not
given
the
logistics
of
getting
to
boston
the
speech
as
you
know
is
at
pm
the
answer
to
the
other
part
of
your
question
is
no
he
hasnt
taken
a
position
on
it
q
you
said
that
speech
in
boston
was
at
pm
ms
myers
i
believe
so
yes
q
do
you
know
what
its
on
ms
myers
well
still
working
out
q
general
vesseys
coming
back
tonight
from
vietnam
when
will
he
be
meeting
with
the
president
ms
myers
no
specific
meeting
is
scheduled
well
talk
to
him
at
some
point
and
see
we
look
forward
to
his
report
but
exactly
how
hell
make
that
report
is
unclear
q
so
hes
not
going
to
come
immediately
to
the
white
house
ms
myers
no
q
the
aids
czar
how
close
are
you
ms
myers
still
working
on
it
q
drug
czar
q
do
you
expect
it
before
the
march
ms
myers
i
dont
have
a
time
line
on
it
q
did
the
president
ask
senator
mitchell
to
try
the
lloyd
cutler
ploy
to
break
the
filibuster
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
q
why
not
ms
myers
hes
just
not
going
to
q
are
senate
democrats
here
at
this
hour
ms
myers
no
thats
tomorrow
tomorrow
at
am
q
update
on
the
stimulus
possible
scaling
down
ms
myers
as
you
know
the
senate
will
vote
on
amendments
today
well
continue
to
talk
the
president
is
committed
to
some
kind
of
a
jobs
package
wed
like
to
see
it
passed
and
well
continue
in
conversations
throughout
the
day
and
see
where
we
end
up
q
when
this
briefing
is
over
can
you
give
us
word
through
the
speaker
or
whatever
whether
the
presidents
talked
to
janet
reno
ms
myers
well
be
happy
to
q
its
become
a
pressing
question
for
the
last
several
hours
ms
myers
no
just
this
minute
that
ive
been
here
and
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
follow
up
on
it
helen
q
does
he
have
an
opinion
on
hatfield
ms
myers
i
mean
obviously
he
prefers
he
offered
a
compromise
package
of
billion
he
believes
that
thats
the
best
alternative
believes
that
hes
obviously
willing
to
take
a
second
look
at
the
package
and
i
think
the
senate
will
vote
on
that
today
and
were
hopeful
that
the
presidents
bill
which
will
be
the
mitchell
amendment
will
be
the
one
that
will
be
approved
q
dee
dee
is
there
any
white
house
official
that
will
be
at
the
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
somebody
will
be
there
representing
the
president
i
dont
know
who
yet
q
well
has
it
been
decided
how
hes
going
to
address
is
it
going
to
be
a
videotape
or
a
phone
call
ms
myers
i
think
it
will
probably
be
a
letter
but
there
hasnt
been
a
final
decision
on
that
yet
q
the
official
will
read
the
letter
is
that
what
it
sounds
like
ms
myers
correct
q
lloyd
bentsen
came
in
here
this
morning
do
you
know
what
was
that
about
was
that
about
this
waco
thing
ms
myers

actually
it
wasnt
it
may
have
come
up
but
it
was
about
economic
issues
q
on
health
care
is
the
of
may
still
the
target
ms
myers
thats
still
the
target
q
and
theres
talk
about
a
joint
session
of
congress
speech
at
the
end
of
may
ms
myers
we
havent
resolved
exactly
how
the
president
will
present
the
health
care
plan
to
the
people
i
wouldnt
rule
that
out
as
an
option
but
no
decisions

been
made

would
up

call

claytoon
let

say
that
hypothetically
i
agree
with
you
that
gay

are

more

why
does
this
indicate
they
are
screwed
up
people
btw
it
occurs
to
me
that
since
in
my
experience
men
are
much
more
interested
in
sex
than
women
and
want
to
have
sex
much
earlier
in
a
relationship
than
women
do
that
homosexuals
would
have
sex
more
often
simply
becuase
their
partner
is
of
a
like
mind
ie
heterosexual
men
would
be
more
promiscuous
if
they
could
its
my
observation
that
women
are
more
likely
to
me
more
strongly
indoctronated
into
now
wanting
sex
that
are
men
also
there
are
definite
double
standards
for
men
and
women
who
are
promiscuous
could
there
also
be
a
factor

the

households
were
economically
diversified
producing
not

agricultural
goods
but
also
manufactured
goods
especially
cloth
many
farm
women
carded
spun
andor
wove
producing
not

cloth
for
their
own
family
but
also
to
sell
generating
extra
income
but
about
this
time
the
industrial
revolution
was
underway
in
england
and
by
the
it
had
moved
to
the
us
in
both
cases
in
the
form
of
textile
mills
these
mills
could
produce
cloth
far
more
efficiently
and
cheaply
than
people
at
home
the
result
was
that
an
important
source
of
home
income
was
wiped
out
and
many
of
these
women
were
compelled
by
economic
circumstance
to
go
to
work
in
these
same
mills
in
lowell
mass
or
nashua
nh
where
they
worked
hour
weeks
in
deafening
dangerous
conditions
living
regimented
lives
and
being
exposed
to
cottondust
and
infectious
dis
eases
due
to
the
work
now
people
didnt
have
to
buy
the
cheaper
factorymade
cloth
they
were
free
to
keep
buying
the
homemade
variety
and
support
their
local
economy
things
are
designed
in
such
a
way
that
in
order
to
go
with
the
system
and
make
money
everything
else
we
care
about
goes
to
shit
but
sorry
for
the
cliche
it
takes
two
to
tango
the
big
rich
corporations
achieved
that
wealth
because
we
buy
their
stuff
it
used
to
be
the
case
that
the
business
center
of
a
town
was
also
its
social
center
you
knew
the
merchants
you
did
business
with
or
even
local
kids
working
behind
the
counter
you
would
see
people
on
the
street
whom
you
knew
and
you
could
stop
for
a
chat
nowadays
local
merchants
are
going
out
of
business
and
people
shop
at
huge
anonymous
malls
serving
regional
populations
of
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
you
have
no
particular
relationship
with
the
companies
you
do
business
with
and
feel
no
particular
commitment
to
them
nor
they
to
you
major
components
of
what
defines
a
com
munity
have
been
destroyed
on
the
other
hand
the
products
we
buy
at
these
malls
are
a
lot
cheaper
due
to
economies
of
scale
and
foreign
manufacture
and
they
are
probably
of
better
or
at
least
more
consistent
quality
i
have
to
constantly
remind
myself
that
the
goal
of
human
society
is
not
to
make
money
money
doesnt
make
us
happy
it
just
prevents
certain
things
making
us
more
unhappy
therefore
dont
shoot
the
rich
shoot
the
conservatives
dont
blame
the
conservatives
for
this
everyone
makes
their
own
individual
choice
and
the
liberals
and
the
fencesitters
are
just
as
guilty
of
pretending
there
are
no
social

cultural
consequences
to
economic
choices

both

more
than
either
trust
the

and
will
desire

if
a

the

contarary
to
the

odds
are
pretty
good
the

so
we
try

ensure
that
the
process

deciding
whether
to
introduce
third

isnt
random
as
steve
said
above
there
are

are
less

corrupt
than
the
two
primary

should
this

not

a
third

should
be
able
to
use
persuasion
to
sway
the
transaction
if
on
the
other
hand
we
condone
the
use
of
force

by
the

then
we
are

could

toured

last

all
this
focus
on
the
holocaust
how
does
that
weigh
on
your
decision
making
process
as
far
as
bosnia
is
concerned
the
president
well
i
think
the
holocaust
is
the
most
extreme
example
the
world
has
ever
known
of
ethnic
cleansing
and
i
think
that
even
in
its
more
limited
manifestations
its
an
idea
that
should
be
opposed
you
couldnt
help
thinking
about
that
thats
not
to
compare
the
two
examples
theyre
not
identical
everyone
knows
that
but
i
think
that
the
united
states
should
always
seek
an
opportunity
to
stand
up
against
at
least
to
speak
out
against
inhumanity
q
sir
how
close
are
you
to
a
decision
on
more
sanctions
on
bosnia
the
president
well
of
course
weve
got
the
un
vote
ambassador
albright
was
instrumental
in
the
un
vote
to
strengthen
the
sanctions
and
they
are
quite
tough
and
we
now
are
putting
our
heads
at
the
business
of
implementing
them
and
looking
at
what
other
options
we
ought
to
consider
and
i
dont
have
anything
else
to
say
except
to
tell
you
that
i
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
on
it
and
will
continue
to
over
the
next
several
days
q
following
your
meeting
today
sir
are
you
any
closer
to
some
sort
of
us
military
presence
there
the
president
i
have
not
made
any
decisions
q
president
clinton
why
have
you
decided
to
meet
with
mr
havel
the
president
well
im
just
honored
that
he
would
come
and
see
me
im
glad
hes
here
in
the
united
states
for
the
dedication
of
the
holocaust
museum
he
is
a
figure
widely
admired
in
our
country
and
around
the
world
and
a
very
important
person
in

and
a

know
that
he
was
ever
disparaged
as
a
bean
eater
in
the
american
southwest
and
west
eg
texas
california
colorado
the
term
bean
eater
is
sometimes
used
as
a
slur
against
those
of
hispanic
heritage
generally
mexicans
in
those
parts
much
like
how
the
irish
in

are
perceived
by
some
as
voracious

writes
the
situation
in
waco
was
similar
to
a
hostage
situation
with
a
madman
holding
a
gun
against
the
head
of
an
innocent
person
in
such
a
situation
a
person
who
provokes
the
madman
and
causes
him
to
pull
the
guns
trigger
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
hostage
janet
reno
blindly
stumbled
in
there
and
basically
threw
a
tear
gas
container
at
the
madman
hoping
that
he
would
release
the
hostage
its
no
surprise
that
the
madman
would
pull
the
trigger
in
response
to
that
kind
of
provocation
just
out
of
curiosity
what
else
was
there
to
do
in
this
situation
wait
another
daysweeksmonthsyears
was
there
anything

were
going

the

am

ms
myers
at
pm
were
having
a
press
conference
bill
in
the
east
room
and
then
saturday
the
president
will
leave
here
at
roughly
am
and
fly
down
to
jamestown
he
will
spend
the
day
there
overnight
at
camp
david
on
sunday
its
unclear
exactly
what
time
hell
leave
camp
david
and
fly
to
boston
hell
leave
from
hagerstown
the
press
plane
will
leave
from

he
will
meet
with
some
q
what
kind
of
a

is
that
hes
taking
ms
myers
that
hes
taking
hell
probably
take
a
c
q
from

ms
myers
from
hagerstown
air
force
one
doesnt
fly
out
of
hagerstown
apparently
q
how
will
the
pool
travel
ms
myers
the
pool
will
have
to
meet
him
ahead
of
time
so
i
guess
the
pool
will
travel
with
the
press
plane
and
wait
for
him
at
the
airport
there
is
currently
no
provision
and
ill
doublecheck
because
theres
currently
no
provision
i
think
thats
standard
operating
practice
q
the
pool
is
not
going
to
meet
him
and
watch
him
get
on
the
plane
at
hagerstown
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
q
what
time
does
he
have
to
be
in
boston
ms
myers
hes
going
to
meet
there
with
a
group
of
citizens
mostly
people
who
supported
us
during
the
campaign
at
around
pm
were
still
working
out
the
final
times
q
at
the
airport
ms
myers
no
it
will
be
at
the
boston
harbor
hotel
and
then
he
will
also
meet
with
some
a
youth
group
that
authored
something
called
project
the
speech
to
the
publishers
is
actually
at
pm
it
will
be
followed
by
qa
and
then
after
the
speech
and
qa
hell
attend
a
reception
with
the
publishers
and
then
return
to
washington
from
boston
and
thats
it
for
the
weekend
q
has
the
president
seen
the
report
from
or
the
letter
communication
from
the
foreign
service
officers
also
obviously
the
communication
from
madeleine
albright
and
what
is
his
reaction
to
their
call
on
him
ms
myers
well
obviously
the
letter
was
written
to
secretary
christopher
i
believe
secretary
christopher
received
the
letter
on
saturday
he
reviewed
it
and
met
with
the
authors
on
monday
to
discuss
their
views
he
believes
its
an
important
part
of
the
policymaking
process
and
is
taking
their
views
into
account
as
we
go
forward
in
the
development
of
the
bosnia
policy
q
what
is
the
presidents
reaction
ms
myers
the
president
hasnt
seen
the
letter
it
was
something
that
was
directed
towards
secretary
christopher
in
terms
of
he
hasnt
seen
specifically
the
letter
but
in
terms
of
their
concerns
generally
what
the
president
has
said
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
options
on
the
table
now
including
ones
that
werent
there
before
and
i
think
hes
as
is
everybody
gravely
concerned
about
the
situation
in
bosnia
q
is
he
influenced
by
that
i
mean
how
does
he
feel
about
the
fact
that
all
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
those
desk
officers
ms
myers
many
of
the
specialists
in
that
area
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
part
of
the
process
its
something
their
views
will
clearly
be
considered
i
think
secretary
christopher
met
with
the
group
immediately
to
discuss
their
views
i
think
he
believes
that
there
ought
to
be
room
for
opinions
and
that
those
opinions
ought
to
be
considered
particularly
from
people
who
work
closely
on
the
issues
q
what
do
you
mean
there
are
options
on
the
table
that
werent
there
before
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
said
last
week
that
there
were
options
such
as
lifting
the
arms
embargo
to
the
bosnian
muslims
that
had
been
previously
off
the
table
that
are
now
being
considered
q
dee
dee
in
terms
of
those
options
madeleine
albright
is
saying
that
potentially
there
could
be
unilateral
action
by
the
us
if
the
europeans
did
not
go
along
is
that
on
the
table
ms
myers
well
i
cant
discuss
anything
that
would
any
conversations
that
would
have
happened
between
ambassador
albright
and
the
president
but
i
think
the
president
has
said
he
would
certainly
is
working
with
our
european
allies
hes
had
a
number
of
conversations
with
european
leaders
and
is
trying
to
build
some
consensus
there
q
will
he
reach
a
decision
will
he
have
anything
specific
to
say
today
ms
myers
no
i
mean
in
term
of
there
will
be
no
new
announcement
of
policy
today
q
does
your
statement
mean
he
has
ruled
out
unilateral
action
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
at
this
point
he
has
said
i
think
hes
been
fairly
clear
about
it
that
the
he
believes
that
the
us
needs
to
act
in
concert
with
its
allies
on
this
q
on
that
point
does
he
believe
that
the
us
though
does
have
builtin
authority
from
the
united
nations
already
to
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
well
i
think
the
un
resolution
makes
it
clear
that
you
can
act
unilaterally
in
support
of
any
humanitarian
relief
effort
i
think
the
broader
point
is
that
anything
we
do
any
options
that
we
decide
to
pursue
we
will
make
sure
that
it
is
consistent
with
un
authority
and
if
its
not
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
we
get
it
q
dee
dee
then
how
does
the
white
house
someone
as
distinguished
as
elie
wiesel
who
says
that
not
enough
is
being
done
to
stop
the
atrocities
going
on
in
bosnia
ms
myers
i
think
that
thats
why
were
considering
additional
options
i
think
that
mr
wiesels
comments
yesterday
were
quite
compelling
the
situation
in
bosnia
is
tragic
the
president
is
very
concerned
about
it
he
has
i
think
president
clinton
has
worked
very
hard
to
take
further
actions
to
continue
to
isolate
serbia
in
the
world
community
clearly
were
considering
other
options
because
the
president
is
concerned
that
perhaps
its
not
enough
q
in
terms
of
what
you
were
just
talking
about
it
sounds
like
resolution
justifies
unilateral
action
by
the
us
to
protect
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
dont
think
it
i
wouldnt
use
the
word
justify
it
permits
unilateral
action
by
any
country
in
protecting
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
relief
but
i
think
thats
just
an
explanation
of
the
resolution
i
think
any
action
that
we
take
will
be
consistent
with
un
resolutions
or
well
work
with
our
allies
to
make
sure
that
it
is
permissible
or
well
get
further
action
q
the
president
and
other
officials
have
ruled
out
unilateral
us
action
in
bosnia
in
the
past
youre
declining
to
do
that
this
morning
ms
myers
no
i
said
the
president
has
said
repeatedly
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
that
doesnt
mean
that
he
wont
act
alone
which
has
been
said
before
explicitly
ms
myers
i
dont
mean
to
imply
a
change
in
policy
the
president
has
said
all
along
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
our
allies
on
this
q
one
other
little
question
did
he
know
about
this
letter
from
the
foreign
service
officers
before
it
hit
the
papers
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
secretary
christopher
they
may
have
had
a
private
conversation
about
it
the
president
has
not
seen
it
q
they
met
on
monday
right
christopher
met
surely
he
must
have
brought
that
up
ms
myers
again
they
may
have
talked
privately
about
it
but
q
dee
dee
what
youre
saying
is
that
the
albright
recommendation
has
been
rejected
is
that
correct
ms
myers
no
i
didnt
say
that
at
all
i
said
i
wont
i
said
i
wouldnt
comment
on
any
conversations
or
communications
q
shes
advocating
unilateral
action
and
youre
saying
in
effect
that
we
will
not
take
unilateral
action
ms
myers
i
am
not
confirming
anything
that
madeleine
albright
may
or
may
not
have
recommended
q
given
the
sometimes
delicate
complicated
and
frustrating
nature
of
negotiations
with
the
allies
on
this
issue
does
the
president
find
this
kind
of
letter
from
foreign
service
officers
of
the
state
department
helpful
to
that
process
hurtful
to
that
ms
myers
i
think
that
their
views
are
obviously
being
considered
the
secretary
received
that
memo
on
saturday
and
two
days
later
he
met
with
them
in
order
to
have
a
more
thorough
airing
of
their
views
of
the
basis
for
their
views
to
discuss
in
greater
detail
the
options
that
they
had
presented
in
the
letter
q
doesnt
it
put
some
kind
of
pressure
on
additional
pressure
on
him
now
from
within
his
own
administration
to
act
regardless
of
what
the
allies
may
or
may
not
do
ms
myers
i
think
clearly
theres
a
broad
policy
review
underway
now
and
the
president
and
his
advisors
are
considering
a
number
of
options
including
some
of
those
outlined
in
the
letter
from
the
folks
over
at
the
state
department
now
no
decisions
have
been
made
on
that
yet
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
through
review
underway
and
that
their
opinions
are
being
very
seriously
considered
q
if
i
can
just
follow
up
i
guess
what
im
looking
for
is
what
was
his
reaction
to
this
letter
did
he
say
good
this
bolsters
my
position
or
did
he
say
damn
this
is
just
what
i
dont
need
right
now
ms
myers
i
think
he
said
this
helps
contribute
substantively
to
the
debate
its
important
that
all
views
be
considered
and
aired
thoroughly
that
before
he
makes
a
decision
he
wants
to
have
the
best
possible
advice
and
information
possible
and
this
i
think
in
many
ways
furthers
that
goal
q
so
internal
advice
to
a
cabinet
official
or
the
president
its
all
open
now
and
you
wouldnt
take
any
umbrage
or
say
that
they
were
out
of
line
ms
myers
i
think
that
the
fact
that
secretary
christopher
met
with
them
to
discuss
their
views
and
make
sure
they
had
an
opportunity
to
have
a
more
complete
conversation
about
it
is
conclusive
evidence
that
their
views
are
welcome
q
does
the
policy
review
include
what
madeleine
albright
has
suggested
and
what
joe
biden
and
others
have
suggested
which
is
that
the
previous
un
resolutions
authorize
unilateral
action
military
action
for
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
the
unilateral
option
is
on
the
table
ms
myers
i
think
all
options
are
on
the
table
q
weve
had
two
different
q
isnt
that
a
change
dee
dee
q
that
would
be
a
change
of
policy
q
particularly
if
it
includes
ground
troops
which
has
been
specifically
ruled
out
ms
myers
i
think
the
president
has
been
well
no
i
dont
that
is
not
q
are
you
talking
about
all
options
ms
myers
all
options
i
think
the
president
has
been
fairly
clear
about
that
so
let
me
just
review
again
what
he
has
said
he
has
said
that
the
president
has
said
all
options
are
on
the
table
with
the
exception
of
the
introduction
of
ground
troops
which
he
has
never
suggested
he
has
ruled
that
out
from
the
beginning
q
hasnt
he
ruled
out
unilateral
action
of
any
sort
ms
myers
he
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
the
us
can
solve
the
problems
in
the
former
yugoslavia
by
itself
i
think
that
there
are
a
number
of
very
complicated
options
on
the
table
right
now
i
dont
think
that
again
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
specific
options
that
are
being
considered
other
than
in
the
broad
categories
that
weve
already
said
things
like
lifting
the
arms
embargo
against
the
bosnian
muslims
things
that
i
think
weve
talked
about
in
broad
terms
this
is
a
very
complicated
situation
the
options
being
presented
and
considered
are
very
complicated
q
air
strikes
on
the
table
ms
myers
again
i
think
thats
been
fairly
clearly
pointed
out
that
thats
something
thats
being
discussed
q
dee
dee
are
ground
troops
on
the
ms
myers
no
ground
troops
are
not
being
considered
q
you
said
there
was
not
going
to
be
you
said
you
were
not
announcing
a
change
of
policy
then
you
said
everything
is
on
the
table
were
confused
are
unilateral
actions
on
the
table
ms
myers
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
the
president
has
said
that
he
doesnt
believe
that
he
wants
to
act
in
concert
with
the
allies
on
this
q
wants
to
but
hes
willing
to
i
mean
if
they
dont
go
along
ms
myers
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
on
this
hes
continuing
to
have
discussions
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
thats
clear
the
conversation
is
ongoing
were
going
to
continue
to
work
with
them
to
find
the
best
possible
solution
and
next
step
on
this
q
dee
dee
the
allies
have
taken
the
position
that
to
conduct
any
kind
of
air
strikes
in
bosnia
would
have
the
opposite
effect
of
ensuring
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
that
they
feel
that
their
troops
on
the
ground
monitoring
the
delivery
of
that
aid
would
become
vulnerable
and
the
bosnians
ms
myers
im
not
sure
thats
the
consistent
i
mean
im
not
sure
who
youre
referring
to
q
the
british
and
the
french
q
yes
the
british
and
french
theyve
taken
the
position
that
the
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
would
be
jeopardized
by
any
kind
of
air
strikes
against
the
bosnian
military
does
the
us
believe
differently
from
that
ms
myers
the
president
has
had
conversations
with
both
mitterrand
and
major
as
you
know
i
think
that
there
is
a
thorough
review
of
policy
going
on
in
those
countries
as
well
and
i
dont
want
to
comment
on
the
nature
of
the
presidents
discussions
other
than
to
say
that
hes
continuing
to
consult
with
our
allies
as
we
move
forward
and
hes
continuing
to
press
them
for
further
action
and
i
think
that
process
is
ongoing
q
the
other
day
voted
against
any
military
intervention
yesterday
does
the
president
regard
that
as
the
end
of
the
line
or
does
he
does
still
hold
out
some
possibility
of
unilateral
action
the
allies
have
been
very
very
plain
that
they
do
not
want
to
do
anything
ms
myers
the
consultations
are
ongoing
thats
all
i
can
tell
you
at
this
point
q
are
you
saying
that
there
wont
be
any
announcement
on
bosnia
today
in
the
press
conference
ms
myers
no
that
is
not
the
intention
of
the
press
conference
q
what
is
the
intention
ms
myers
its
an
opportunity
to
take
questions
he
may
have
a
brief
im
sure
hell
have
a
brief
opening
statement
but
it
is
not
an
opportunity
to
outline
a
new
policy
on
bosnia
that
will
not
happen
q
can
you
tell
us
what
the
subject
of
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
its
sort
of
a
general
statement
of
where
we
are
q
after
the
first
hundred
days
you
mean
ms
myers
its
not
a
long
statement
i
mean
this
is
just
generally
dont
look
for
any
major
policy
pronouncements
q
do
you
know
what
the
opening
statement
is
ms
myers
but
its
perhaps
later
today
ill
be
able
to
tell
you
with
more
certainty
i
think
thats
still
under
review
but
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
its
not
a
mystery
its
not
meant
to
be
its
just
to
take
questions
q
it
would
be
helpful
to
know
whether
what
the
opening
statement
is
on
ms
myers
since
the
major
purpose
here
is
just
to
take
questions
its
not
completely
resolved
yet
q
dee
dee
one
policy
that
was
expected
last
week
and
that
the
white
house
you
and
george
seemed
to
indicate
we
might
get
would
be
an
aids
czar
will
he
announce
that
today
and
whats
the
delay
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
i
think
we
said
it
would
happen
soon
i
dont
think
we
meant
to
imply
with
any
certainty
that
it
would
be
this
week
it
is
coming
soon
i
dont
anticipate
that
happening
today
q
whats
the
delay
isnt
this
the
perfect
time
to
announce
an
aids
czar
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
its
a
delay
i
think
the
process
is
ongoing
to
find
the
best
possible
person
and
to
go
through
the
necessary
background
checks
and
to
make
sure
that
weve
crossed
the
ts
and
dotted
the
is
before
we
make
an
announcement
q
dee
dee
what
are
zoe
bairds
qualifications
for
the
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
and
why
wasnt
her
appointment
announced
here
ms
myers
the
qualifications
i
dont
know
if
theres
a
specific
list
ill
have
to
check
and
see
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
people
there
on
the
board
with
different
backgrounds
many
of
them
have
long
histories
in
intelligence
or
other
government
service
i
think
theres
a
broad
variety
of
views
across
political
spectrum
and
across
backgrounds
that
are
represented
there
we
never
made
a
formal
announcement
other
than
the
chairman
of
the
board
which
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
why
would
he
appoint
her
though
if
the
american
people
and
many
in
the
senate
rejected
her
for
another
government
job
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
that
the
american
people
ever
had
voted
on
her
and
i
certainly
she
was
never
rejected
in
the
senate
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
but
the
president
believes
shes
a
very
competent
person
hes
said
that
zoe
baird
do
you
understand
what
the
question
is
zoe
baird
is
on
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
q
you
said
she
never
went
up
there
for
a
hearing
q
her
nomination
was
withdrawn
after
public
outrage
over
violating
federal
laws
ms
myers
right
she
never
she
was
never
but
you
said
she
was
rejected
by
the
senate
i
was
just
simply
trying
to
point
out
that
she
was
never
voted
on
by
the
senate
q
so
you
dont
think
that
is
any
problem
ms
myers
i
dont
think
theres
any
problem
q
she
has
been
appointed
to
this
board
is
that
a
fact
ms
myers
yes
q
does
she
need
confirmation
for
this
does
she
need
confirmation
to
be
a
member
of
the
ms
myers
no
its
a
presidential
appointment
q
usually
announcements
are
made
here
at
the
white
house
was
there
a
decision
not
to
announce
her
publicly
ms
myers
we
didnt
make
an
announcement
people
who
asked
were
told
who
the
members
of
the
board
were
we
didnt
make
an
official
announcement
if
anybodys
interested
in
that
we
can
certainly
put
out
the
list
of
names
q
id
like
to
know
q
dont
such
board
members
dont
you
normally
as
a
matter
of
routinely
put
out
releases
on
all
these
boards
and
presidential
appointment
regardless
of
their
dimension
ms
myers
not
always
but
again
im
happy
to
put
this
out
q
isnt
that
the
standard
practice
q
that
was
past
practice
ms
myers
again
im
happy
to
put
it
out
well
put
out
a
list
of
the
members
of
the
board
today
q
dee
dee
i
dont
want
to
try
to
fail
to
let
you
get
out
of
this
swamp
but
laughter
all
i
really
want
to
know
is
hasnt
it
been
the
practice
in
this
administration
for
such
announcements
to
be
made
routinely
ms
myers
i
think
generally
but
not
always
and
were
happy
to
put
that
out
today
q
what
is
the
board
what
is
her
title
what
is
the
size
of
the
board
ms
myers
there
is
roughly
a
dozen
members
on
the
board
it
is
a
civilian
board
although
their
are
some
obviously
retired
military
personnel
on
the
board
that
provide
input
into
intelligence
policy
for
the
president
again
the
chairman
of
that
board
is
admiral
william
crowe
q
and
did
he
recommend
baird
q
whats
the
name
of
the
board
ms
myers
its
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
pfiab
q
whats
her
qualification
that
she
had
employed
an
illegal
alien
is
that
laughter
ms
myers
do
you
want
an
answer
to
the
question
or
you
just
want
to
make
a
joke
q
let
me
phrase
it
another
way
why
shouldnt
this
appointment
be
viewed
as
a
payback
for
the
difficulty
she
had
a
couple
of
months
ago
ms
myers
because
its
not
q
whats
her
experience
in
foreign
intelligence
ms
myers
shes
an
experienced
attorney
someone
who
the
president
believes
is
very
competent
and
qualified
and
i
think
part
of
the
mission
of
this
board
is
to
provide
civilian
input
not
everybody
on
the
board
is
supposed
to
be
an
intelligence
expert
that
is
not
the
boards
mission
it
is
to
provide
civilian
input
for
the
president
as
he
makes
decisions
regarding
intelligence
matters
he
believes
shes
very
qualified
very
competent
person
enormously
talented
and
has
said
that
throughout
q
is
this
just
a
figment
of
my
overactive
imagination
or
was
there
discussion
early
on
about
abolishing
the
presidents
foreign
intelligence
advisory
board
ms
myers
i
dont
think
so
on
december
when
he
announced
all
of
his
foreign
policy
advisors
he
announced
that
he
would
had
appointed
admiral
crowe
as
the
head
of
the
board
so
i
dont
believe
theres
ever
been
any
q
earlier
than
that
during
the
transition
ms
myers
no
i
dont
believe
so
it
was
announced
again
on
december
admiral
crowe
couldnt
be
there
but
it
was
announced
q
are
members
paid
ms
myers
i
dont
believe
so
but
ill
doublecheck
q
on
another
subject
on
waco
how
do
you
explain
the
discrepancy
between
the
federal
reports
of
the
autopsies
of
the
bodies
that
are
coming
out
of
waco
and
the
state
i
guess
its
the
texas
ranger
reports
ms
myers
most
of
the
information
is
coming
the
federal
information
is
coming
from
the
site
clearly
theres
been
some
discrepancies
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
officials
in
the
justice
department
were
told
i
believe
the
day
before
yesterday
that
there
were
several
bodies
found
with
bullet
holes
i
think
theres
some
discrepancy
about
that
and
the
justice
department
is
looking
into
it
q
is
the
president
going
to
get
involved
in
trying
to
sort
out
what
seems
to
be
becoming
a
jurisdictional
morass
down
there
with
some
people
withdrawing
others
saying
theyre
in
charge
but
others
justice
fbi
texas
rangers
all
grabbing
a
piece
of
this
ms
myers
i
dont
know
that
hes
going
to
try
to
mediate
the
dispute
i
mean
ill
let
you
know
if
theres
anything
he
intends
to
do
about
it
but
as
you
know
there
are
several
levels
of
investigation
ongoing
and
were
hopeful
that
they
can
work
together
q
is
there
any
one
agency
or
official
down
there
in
charge
of
everything
ms
myers
i
dont
know
ill
have
to
get
back
to
you
on
that
q
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
sundays
speech
ms
myers
its
going
to
be
fairly
general
i
dont
think
its
going
to
be
any
specific
announcements
i
think
its
going
to
be
sort
of
a
q
does
he
have
a
topic
that
hes
going
to
talk
about
ms
myers
were
still
working
on
it
but
i
wouldnt
look
for
any
announcements
of
like
the
drug
czar
or
something
like
that
q
is
it
sort
of
a
days
speech
sort
of
my
excellent
adventure
for
days
laughter
ms
myers
not
exactly
but
i
think
hell
take
a
little
bit
broader
look
about
whats
happened
in
the
last
q
foreign
domestic
ms
myers
a
little
bit
of
both
but
i
think
a
lot
of
domestic
q
and
overview
ms
myers
yes
more
of
an
overview
than
a
specific
policy
announcement
q
has
there
been
an
agreement
yet
on
a
forum
by
which
the
president
will
address
the
gay
rights
march
on
sunday
ms
myers
it
will
be
a
letter
read
to
the
crowd
by
congresswoman
nancy
pelosi
q
is
that
available
ms
myers
not
yet
but
it
will
be
sure
q
are
you
going
to
put
it
out
here
or
ms
myers
well
probably
put
it
out
here
on
sunday
q
travel
next
week
ms
myers
unclear
q
what
was
the
question
q
likely
ms
myers
i
dont
q
likely
possible
ms
myers
possible
q
whats
possible
ms
myers
travel
q
george
mentioned
yesterday
campaign
finance
reform
and
national
service
legislative
proposals
next
week
do
you
have
days
yet
for
them
ms
myers
not
yet
q
can
you
tell
us
which
order
ms
myers
campaign
finance
reform
first
national
service
later
in
the
week
q
is
there
any
coverage
tomorrow
in
williamsburg
ms
myers
no
q
and
any
report
in
the
aftermath
of
the
day
ms
myers
any
readout
from
the
day
q
readout
ms
myers
its
possible
jeff
eller
will
be
down
there
i
think
he
can
go
through
what
the
president
did
during
the
day
we
dont
expect
any
photo
op
or
anything
other
than
departure
here
in
the
morning
q
dee
dee
the
president
has
not
made
a
regular
practice
as
some
of
his
predecessors
have
of
going
to
camp
david
in
fact
hes
been
there
what
once
or
twice
ms
myers
twice
q
why
this
weekend
ms
myers
he
went
two
weekends
ago
as
you
know
on
the
way
home
from
his
fatherinlaws
funeral
i
think
that
they
found
it
to
be
a
good
experience
and
a
nice
way
for
them
to
spend
some
time
together
as
a
family
and
this
is
just
an
opportunity
to
do
the
same
q
theres
no
march
there
q
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
march
here
ms
myers
no
q
since
hes
going
to
be
in
town
sunday
morning
now
instead
of
in
jamestown
have
you
thought
about
him
making
a
quick
passby
flyover
laughter
ms
myers
hell
fly
straight
to
boston
q
flying
straight
did
you
say
laughter
q
george
took
a
question
yesterday
on
waco
the
president
had
said
on
tuesday
in
the
rose
garden
that
there
was
a
minor
disagreement
on
tactics
between
the
military
advisors
and
the
fbi
and
the
question
was
whether
you
knew
exactly
what
that
was
and
whether
it
related
to
the
use
of
the
particular
kind
of
tear
gas
do
you
have
an
answer
on
that
ms
myers
i
dont
ill
check
the
press
thank
you
am
edt
subject
waco
investigation
do
we
know
yet
who
will
be
holding
the
hearings
and
if
so
do
we
know
who
is
on
the
committee
of
question
askers
im
sure
many
of
us
have
potential
questions
wed
like
to
send
to
them

writes
homosexuals
lie
about
the
number
to
hide
the
disproportionate
involvement
of
homosexuals
in

molestation
they
also
lie
about
to
keep
politicians
scared
you
havent
shown
any
disproportionate

the
janus

which
came
out
recently
gives
as
the

exclusively

predominantly
gay
men
no
one
is
presumably
going

theyre
gay
if
theyre
not
but
some
no

are
going

hide
their

in

thus
the
is

still

the

do
you
have
a
question
q
mr
president
theres
a
growing
feeling
that
the
western
response
to
bloodshed
in
bosnia
has
been
woefully
inadequate
holocaust
survivor
elie
wiesel
asked
you
yesterday
to
do
something
anything
to
stop
the
fighting
is
the
united
states
considering
taking
unilateral
action
such
as
air
strikes
against
serb
artillery
sites
the
president
well
first
let
me
say
as
you
know
for
more
than
a
week
now
we
have
been
seriously
reviewing
our
options
for
further
action
and
i
want
to
say
too
lets
look
at
the
last
three
months
since
i
became
president
i
have
worked
with
our
allies
and
we
have
tried
to
move
forward
first
on
the
nofly
zone
on
enforcement
of
it
on
the
humanitarian
airdrops
on
the
war
crimes
investigation
on
getting
the
bosnian
muslims
involved
in
the
peace
process
we
have
made
some
progress
and
now
we
have
a
very
much
tougher
sanctions
resolution
and
leon
fuerth
who
is
the
national
security
advisor
to
the
vice
president
is
in
europe
now
working
on
implementing
that
that
is
going
to
make
a
big
difference
to
serbia
and
we
are
reviewing
other
options
i
think
we
should
act
we
should
lead
the
united
states
should
lead
we
have
led
for
the
last
three
months
we
have
moved
the
coalition
and
to
be
fair
our
allies
in
europe
have
been
willing
to
do
their
part
and
they
have
troops
on
the
ground
there
but
i
do
not
think
we
should
act
alone
unilaterally
nor
do
i
think
we
will
have
to
and
in
the
next
several
days
i
think
we
will
finalize
the
extensive
review
which
has
been
going
on
and
which
has
taken
a
lot
of
my
time
as
well
as
the
time
of
the
administration
as
it
should
have
over
the
last
days
or
so
i
think
well
finish
that
in
the
near
future
and
then
well
have
a
policy
and
well
announce
it
and
everybody
can
evaluate
it
q
can
i
follow
up
the
president
sure
q
do
you
see
any
parallel
between
the
ethnic
cleansing
in
bosnia
and
the
holocaust
the
president
i
think
the
holocaust
is
on
a
whole
different
level
i
think
it
is
without
precedent
or
peer
in
human
history
on
the
other
hand
ethnic
cleansing
is
the
kind
of
inhumanity
that
the
holocaust
took
to
the
nth
degree
the
idea
of
moving
people
around
and
abusing
them
and
often
killing
them
solely
because
of
their
ethnicity
is
an
abhorrent
thing
and
it
is
especially
troublesome
in
that
area
where
people
of
different
ethnic
groups
live
side
by
side
for
so
long
together
and
i
think
you
have
to
stand
up
against
it
i
think
its
wrong
we
were
talking
today
about
all
of
the
other
troubles
in
that
region
i
was
happy
to
see
the
violence
between
the
croats
and
the
muslims
in
bosnia
subside
this
morning
and
i
think
were
making
progress
on
that
front
but
whats
going
on
with
the
serbians
and
the
ethnic
cleansing
is
qualitatively
different
than
the
other
conflicts
both
within
the
former
yugoslavia
and
in
other
parts
of
the
region
q
mr
president
by
any
count
you
have
not
had
a
good
week
in
your
presidency
the
tragedy
in
waco
the
defeat
of
your
stimulus
bill
the
standoff
in
bosnia
what
did
you
do
wrong
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
differently
how
do
you
look
at
things
are
you
reassessing
laughter
the
president
i
dont
really
believe
that
the
situation
in
bosnia
its
not
been
a
good
week
for
the
world
but
i
dont
know
that
the
administration
could
have
made
it
different
on
the
stimulus
package
id
like
to
put
it
into
the
larger
context
and
remind
you
that
in
this
days
we
have
already
fundamentally
changed
the
direction
of
an
american
government
we
have
abandoned
trickledown
economics
weve
abandoned
the
policies
that
brought
the
debt
of
this
country
from
trillion
to
trillion
in
only
a
decade
the
budget
plan
which
passed
the
congress
which
will
reduce
the
deficit
and
increase
investment
has
led
to
a
low
in
mortgage
rates
dramatically
lower
interest
rates
there
are
probably
people
in
this
room
who
have
refinanced
their
home
mortgages
in
the
last
three
months
or
who
have
had
access
to
cheaper
credit
thats
going
to
put
tens
of
billion
dollars
coursing
throughout
this
economy
in
ways
that
are
very
very
good
for
the
country
and
so
we
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
economically
i
regret
that
the
stimulus
did
not
pass
and
i
have
begun
to
ask
and
will
continue
to
ask
not
only
people
in
the
administration
but
people
in
the
congress
whether
there
is
something
i
could
have
done
differently
to
pass
that
part
of
the
reason
it
didnt
pass
was
politics
part
of
it
was
a
difference
in
ideas
there
are
really
people
still
who
believe
that
its
not
needed
i
just
disagree
with
that
i
think
the
recovery
the
economists
say
its
been
underway
for
about
two
years
and
weve
still
had
months
of
seven
percent
unemployment
and
all
the
wealthy
countries
are
having
trouble
creating
jobs
so
i
think
there
was
an
idea
base
an
argument
there
that
while
were
waiting
for
the
lower
interest
rates
and
the
deficit
reduction
and
the
investments
of
the
next
four
years
to
take
effect
this
sort
of
supplemental
appropriation
should
go
forward
now
i
have
to
tell
you
i
did
misgauge
that
because
a
majority
of
the
republican
senators
now
sitting
in
the
senate
voted
for
a
similar
stimulus
when
ronald
reagan
was
president
in
and
voted
times
for
regular
supplemental
appropriations
like
this
i
just
misgauged
it
and
i
hope
that
i
can
learn
something
ive
just
been
here
days
and
you
know
i
was
a
governor
working
with
a
contentious
legislature
for
years
and
it
took
me
a
decade
to
get
political
reform
there
so
it
takes
time
to
change
things
but
i
basically
feel
very
good
about
whats
happened
in
the
first
days
with
regard
to
the
congress
q
waco
the
president
well
with
regard
to
waco
i
dont
have
much
to
add
to
what
ive
already
said
i
think
it
is
a
i
want
the
situation
looked
into
i
want
us
to
bring
in
people
who
have
any
insights
to
bear
on
that
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
whole
thing
be
thoroughly
gone
over
but
i
still
maintain
what
i
said
from
the
beginning
that
the
offender
there
was
david
koresh
and
i
do
not
think
the
united
states
government
is
responsible
for
the
fact
that
a
bunch
of
fanatics
decided
to
kill
themselves
and
im
sorry
that
they
killed
their
children
q
mr
president
to
follow
up
partly
on
helen
on
your
stimulus
package
and
on
your
political
approach
to
capitol
hill
ross
perot
said
today
that
youre
playing
games
with
the
american
people
in
your
tax
policy
he
was
strongly
critical
of
your
stimulus
package
he
said
hes
going
to
launch
an
advertising
campaign
against
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
how
are
you
going
to
handle
his
political
criticism
will
it
complicate
your
efforts
on
the
hill
with
your
economic
plan
and
do
you
plan
to
repackage
some
of
the
things
that
have
been
in
your
stimulus
program
and
try
to
resubmit
them
to
the
hill
the
president
let
me
answer
that
question
first
were
going
to
revisit
all
of
that
over
the
next
few
days
im
going
to
be
talking
to
members
of
congress
and
to
others
to
see
what
we
can
do
about
that
with
regard
to
the
economic
plan
i
must
say
i
found
that
rather
amazing
i
dont
want
to
get
into
an
argument
with
mr
perot
ill
be
interested
to
hear
what
his
specifics
are
but
i
would
go
back
and
read
his
book
and
his
plan
theres
a
remarkable
convergence
except
that
we
have
more
specific
budget
cuts
we
raise
taxes
less
on
the
middle
class
and
more
on
the
wealthy
but
otherwise
the
plans
are
remarkably
similar
so
i
think
it
would
be
ill
be
interested
to
see
if
maybe
perhaps
hes
changed
his
position
from
his
book
last
year
and
he
has
some
new
ideas
to
bring
to
bear
ill
be
glad
to
hear
them
q
to
follow
up
sir
how
do
you
plan
to
handle
his
political
criticism
hes
launched
a
campaign
against
you
do
you
think
you
can
sit
back
and
just
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
will
ask
you
to
apply
the
same
level
of
scrutiny
to
him
as
you
do
to
me
and
if
hes
changed
his
position
from
the
positions
he
took
in
the
campaign
last
year
then
we
need
to
know
why
and
what
his
ideas
are
maybe
hes
got
some
constructive
ideas
i
think
the
american
people
have
shown
that
theyre
very
impatient
with
people
who
dont
want
to
produce
results
and
the
one
thing
i
think
that
everybody
has
figured
out
about
me
in
the
last
even
if
they
dont
agree
with
what
i
do
is
that
i
want
to
get
something
done
i
just
came
here
to
try
to
change
things
i
want
to
do
things
and
i
want
to
do
things
that
help
peoples
lives
so
my
judgment
is
that
if
he
makes
a
suggestion
that
is
good
that
is
constructive
that
takes
us
beyond
some
idea
ive
proposed
that
will
change
peoples
lives
for
the
better
fine
but
i
think
that
that
ought
to
be
the
test
that
we
apply
to
everyone
who
weighs
into
this
debate
and
not
just
to
the
president
q
mr
president
to
go
back
to
bosnia
for
a
minute
you
continue
to
insist
that
this
has
to
be
multilateral
action
a
criteria
that
seems
to
have
hamstrung
us
when
it
comes
to
many
options
thus
far
and
makes
it
look
as
if
this
is
a
state
of
paralysis
the
united
states
is
the
last
remaining
superpower
why
is
it
not
appropriate
in
this
situation
for
the
united
states
to
act
unilaterally
the
president
well
the
united
states
surely
you
would
agree
that
the
united
states
even
as
the
last
remaining
superpower
has
to
act
consistent
with
international
law
under
some
mandate
of
the
united
nations
q
but
you
have
a
mandate
and
the
president
they
do
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
under
review
i
havent
ruled
out
any
option
for
action
i
would
remind
all
of
you
i
have
not
ruled
out
any
option
except
that
we
have
not
discussed
and
we
are
not
considering
the
introduction
of
american
forces
into
continuing
hostilities
there
we
are
not
so
we
are
reviewing
other
options
but
i
also
would
remind
you
that
to
be
fair
our
allies
have
had
the
french
the
british
and
the
canadians
have
had
troops
on
the
ground
there
they
have
been
justifiably
worried
about
those
but
they
have
supported
the
airdrops
the
toughening
of
the
sanctions
they
welcomed
the
american
delegation
now
in
europe
working
on
how
to
make
these
sanctions
really
work
and
really
bite
against
serbia
and
i
can
tell
you
that
the
other
nations
involved
are
also
genuinely
reassessing
their
position
and
i
would
not
rule
out
the
fact
that
we
can
reach
an
agreement
for
a
concerted
action
that
goes
beyond
where
we
have
been
i
dont
have
any
criticism
of
the
british
the
french
and
others
about
that
q
would
that
be
military
action
q
mr
president
several
of
the
leading
lights
in
your
administration
ranging
from
your
fbi
director
to
your
un
ambassador
to
your
deputy
budget
director
to
your
health
services
secretary
have
issued
statements
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
which
are
absolutely
contradictory
to
some
of
the
positions
youve
taken
in
your
administration
why
is
that
are
you
losing
your
political
grip
the
president
give
me
an
example
q
example
judge
sessions
said
that
there
was
no
child
abuse
in
waco
madeleine
albright
has
said
in
this
mornings
newspapers
at
least
that
she
favors
air
strikes
in
bosnia
all
of
these
are
things
you
said
that
you
didnt
support
the
president
first
of
all
i
dont
know
what
we
know
that
david
koresh
had
sex
with
children
i
think
that
is
undisputed
is
it
not
is
it
not
does
anybody
dispute
that
where
i
come
from
that
qualifies
as
child
abuse
and
we
know
that
he
had
people
teaching
these
kids
how
to
kill
themselves
i
think
that
qualifies
as
abuse
and
im
not
criticizing
judge
sessions
because
i
dont
know
exactly
what
he
said
in
terms
of
madeleine
albright
madeleine
albright
has
made
no
public
statement
at
all
about
air
strikes
there
is
a
press
report
that
she
wrote
me
a
confidential
letter
in
which
she
expressed
her
or
memo
in
which
she
expressed
her
views
about
the
new
direction
we
should
take
in
response
to
my
request
to
all
the
senior
members
of
my
administration
to
let
me
know
what
they
thought
we
ought
to
do
next
and
i
have
heard
from
her
and
from
others
about
what
they
think
we
ought
to
do
next
and
im
not
going
to
discuss
the
recommendations
they
made
to
me
but
in
the
next
few
days
when
i
make
a
decision
about
what
to
do
then
i
will
announce
what
im
going
to
do
so
i
wouldnt
say
that
either
one
of
those
examples
qualifies
speaking
out
of
school
q
how
about
the
value
added
tax
mr
president
the
president
what
was
that
q
the
value
added
tax
mrs
rivlin
and
miss
shalala
both
said
that
they
thought
that
that
was
a
good
idea
the
president
i
dont
mind
them
saying
they
think
its
a
good
idea
there
are
all
kinds
of
arguments
for
it
on
policy
grounds
that
does
not
mean
that
we
have
decided
to
incorporate
it
in
the
health
care
debate
no
decision
has
been
made
on
that
and
i
have
no
objection
to
their
expressing
their
views
on
that
weve
had
a
lot
of
people
from
business
and
labor
come
to
us
saying
that
they
thought
that
tax
would
help
make
their
particular
industries
more
competitive
in
the
global
economy
i
took
no
that
wasnt
taking
a
line
against
an
administration
policy
q
mr
president
a
week
ago
a
group
of
gay
and
lesbian
representatives
came
out
of
a
meeting
with
you
and
expressed
in
the
most
ringing
terms
their
confidence
in
your
understanding
of
them
and
their
political
aspirations
and
their
belief
that
you
would
fulfill
those
aspirations
do
you
feel
now
that
you
will
be
able
to
meet
their
now
enhanced
expectations
the
president
well
i
dont
know
about
that
and
i
dont
know
what
their
it
depends
on
what
the
expectations
are
but
ill
tell
you
this
i
believe
that
this
countrys
policies
should
be
heavily
biased
in
favor
of
nondiscrimination
i
believe
when
you
tell
people
they
cant
do
certain
things
in
this
country
that
other
people
can
do
there
ought
to
be
an
overwhelming
and
compelling
reason
for
it
i
believe
we
need
the
services
of
all
of
our
people
and
i
have
said
that
consistently
and
not
as
a
political
proposition
the
first
time
this
issue
came
up
was
in
when
i
was
in
boston
i
was
just
asked
the
question
about
it
and
i
might
add
its
interesting
that
i
have
been
attacked
obviously
those
who
disagree
with
me
here
are
primarily
coming
from
the
political
right
in
america
when
i
was
governor
i
was
attacked
from
the
other
direction
for
sticking
up
for
the
rights
of
religious
fundamentalists
to
run
their
child
care
centers
and
to
practice
home
schooling
under
appropriate
safeguards
i
just
have
always
had
an
almost
libertarian
view
that
we
should
try
to
protect
the
rights
of
american
individual
citizens
to
live
up
to
the
fullest
of
their
capacities
and
im
going
to
stick
right
with
that
q
are
you
concerned
sir
that
you
may
have
generated
expectations
on
their
end
and
criticism
among
others
that
has
hamstrung
your
administration
in
the
sense
of
far
too
great
emphasis
on
this
issue
the
president
yes
but
i
have
not
placed
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
it
its
gotten
a
lot
of
emphasis
in
other
quarters
and
in
the
press
ive
just
simply
taken
my
position
and
tried
to
see
it
through
and
thats
what
i
do
it
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
my
time
as
president
to
say
what
i
believe
in
and
what
i
intend
to
do
and
thats
what
ill
continue
to
do
q
mr
president
getting
back
to
the
situation
in
bosnia
and
we
understand
you
havent
made
any
final
decisions
on
new
options
previously
considered
unacceptable
but
the
two
most
commonly
heard
options
would
be
lifting
the
arms
embargo
to
enable
the
bosnian
muslims
to
defend
themselves
and
to
initiate
some
limited
air
strikes
perhaps
to
cut
off
supply
lines
without
telling
us
your
decision
presumably
you
havent
made
any
final
decisions
on
those
two
options
what
are
the
pros
and
cons
that
are
going
through
your
mind
right
now
and
will
weigh
heavily
on
your
final
decision
the
president
im
reluctant
to
get
into
this
there
are
those
are
two
of
the
options
there
are
some
other
options
that
have
been
considered
all
have
pluses
and
minuses
all
have
supporters
and
opponents
within
the
administration
and
in
the
congress
where
i
would
remind
you
heavy
consultations
will
be
required
to
embark
on
any
new
policy
i
do
believe
that
on
the
air
strike
issue
the
pronouncements
that
general
powell
has
made
generally
about
military
action
apply
there
if
you
take
action
if
the
united
states
takes
action
we
must
have
a
clearlydefined
objective
that
can
be
met
we
must
be
able
to
understand
it
and
its
limitations
must
be
clear
the
united
states
is
not
should
not
become
involved
as
a
partisan
in
a
war
with
regard
to
the
lifting
of
the
arms
embargo
the
question
obviously
there
is
if
you
widen
the
capacity
of
people
to
fight
will
that
help
to
get
a
settlement
and
bring
about
peace
will
it
lead
to
more
bloodshed
what
kind
of
reaction
can
others
have
that
would
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
the
policy
but
i
think
both
of
them
deserve
some
serious
consideration
along
with
some
other
options
we
have
q
do
you
think
that
these
people
who
are
trying
to
get
us
into
war
in
bosnia
are
really
remembering
that
we
havent
taken
care
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
veterans
from
the
last
war
and
we
couldnt
take
care
of
our
prisoners
and
get
them
all
home
from
vietnam
and
now
many
of
them
are
coming
up
with
bills
for
treatment
of
agent
orange
how
can
we
afford
to
go
to
any
more
of
these
wars
the
president
well
i
think
thats
a
good
argument
against
the
united
states
itself
becoming
involved
as
a
belligerent
in
a
war
there
but
we
are
after
all
the
worlds
only
super
power
we
do
have
to
lead
the
world
and
there
is
a
very
serious
problem
of
systematic
ethnic
cleansing
in
the
former
yugoslavia
which
could
have
not
only
enormous
further
humanitarian
consequences
and
goodness
knows
there
have
been
many
but
also
could
have
other
practical
consequences
in
other
nearby
regions
where
the
same
sorts
of
ethnic
tensions
exist
q
did
you
make
any
kind
of
agreement
with
boris
yeltsin
to
hold
off
either
on
air
strikes
or
any
kind
of
aggressive
action
against
the
serbs
until
after
sunday
and
in
general
how
has
his
political
situation
affected
your
deliberation
on
bosnia
the
president
no
i
have
not
made
any
agreement
and
he
did
not
ask
for
that
we
never
even
discussed
that
interestingly
enough
the
russians
i
would
remind
you
in
the
middle
of
president
yeltsins
campaign
abstained
from
our
attempt
to
get
tougher
sanctions
through
the
united
nations
in
what
i
thought
was
the
proper
decision
for
them
and
one
that
the
united
states
and
im
sure
the
rest
of
the
free
world
very
much
appreciated
q
do
you
wish
mr
president
that
youd
become
more
involved
in
the
planning
of
the
waco
operation
and
how
would
you
handle
that
situation
differently
now
the
president
i
dont
think
as
a
practical
matter
that
the
president
should
become
involved
in
the
planning
of
those
kinds
of
things
at
that
detail
one
of
the
things
that
im
sure
will
come
out
when
we
look
into
this
is
the
questions
will
be
asked
and
answered
did
all
of
us
who
up
the
line
of
command
ask
the
questions
we
should
have
asked
and
get
the
answers
we
should
have
gotten
and
i
look
forward
to
that
but
at
the
time
i
have
to
say
as
i
did
before
the
first
thing
i
did
after
the
atf
agents
were
killed
once
we
knew
that
the
fbi
was
going
to
go
in
was
to
ask
that
the
military
be
consulted
because
of
the
quasi
as
least
military
nature
of
the
conflict
given
the
resources
that
koresh
had
in
his
compound
and
their
obvious
willingness
to
use
them
and
then
on
the
day
before
the
action
i
asked
the
questions
of
the
attorney
general
which
i
have
reported
to
you
previously
and
which
at
the
time
i
thought
were
sufficient
i
have
as
i
said
im
sure
i
leave
it
to
others
to
make
the
suggestions
about
whether
there
are
other
questions
i
should
have
asked
q
mr
president
what
is
your
assessment
of
director
sessions
role
in
the
waco
affair
and
have
you
made
a
decision
on
his
future
and
if
you
havent
will
you
give
him
a
personal
hearing
before
you
do
decide
the
president
well
first
of
all
i
have
no
assessment
of
his
role
since
i
had
no
direct
contact
with
him
and
i
mean
no
negative
or
positive
inference
i
have
no
assessment
there
i
stand
by
what
i
said
before
about
my
general
high
regard
for
the
fbi
and
im
waiting
for
a
recommendation
from
the
attorney
general
about
what
to
do
with
the
direction
of
the
fbi
q
mr
president
since
you
said
that
one
side
in
bosnia
conflict
represents
inhumanity
that
the
holocaust
carried
to
the
nth
degree
why
do
you
then
tell
us
that
the
united
states
cannot
take
a
partisan
view
in
this
war
the
president
well
i
said
that
the
principle
of
ethnic
cleansing
is
something
we
ought
to
stand
up
against
that
does
not
mean
that
the
united
states
or
the
united
nations
can
enter
a
war
in
effect
to
redraw
the
lines
geographical
lines
of
republics
within
what
was
yugoslavia
or
that
that
would
ultimately
be
successful
i
think
what
the
united
states
has
to
do
is
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
there
is
some
way
consistent
with
forcing
the
people
to
resolve
their
own
difficulties
we
can
stand
up
to
and
stop
ethnic
cleansing
and
that
is
obviously
the
difficulty
we
are
wrestling
with
this
is
clearly
the
most
difficult
foreign
policy
problem
we
face
and
that
all
of
our
allies
face
and
if
it
were
easy
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
solved
before
we
have
tried
to
do
more
in
the
last
days
than
was
previously
done
it
has
clearly
not
been
enough
to
stop
the
serbian
aggression
and
we
are
now
looking
at
what
else
we
can
do
q
yesterday
you
specifically
criticized
the
roosevelt
administration
for
not
having
bombed
the
railroads
to
the
concentration
camps
and
things
that
were
near
military
targets
arent
there
steps
like
that
that
would
not
involve
conflict
direct
conflict
or
partisan
belligerence
that
you
might
consider
the
president
there
may
be
i
would
remind
you
that
the
circumstances
were
somewhat
different
we
were
then
at
war
with
germany
at
the
time
and
thats
what
made
that
whole
incident
so
series
of
incidents
so
perplexing
but
we
have
as
i
say
weve
got
all
of
our
options
under
review
q
the
diplomatic
initiative
on
haiti
is
on
the
verge
of
collapse
what
can
you
do
to
salvage
it
short
of
a
fullscale
military
operation
the
president
well
you
may
know
something
i
dont
thats
not
what
our
people
tell
me
i
think
mr
caputo
and
ambassador
pezzullo
have
done
together
a
good
job
the
thing
keeps
going
back
and
forth
because
of
the
people
who
are
involved
with
the
de
facto
government
there
its
obvious
what
their
concerns
are
they
were
the
same
concerns
that
led
to
the
ouster
of
aristide
in
the
first
place
and
president
aristide
we
feel
should
be
restored
to
power
were
working
toward
that
i
get
a
report
on
that
we
discuss
it
at
least
three
times
a
week
and
im
convinced
that
were
going
to
prevail
there
and
be
successful
i
do
believe
that
theres
every
reason
to
think
that
there
will
have
to
be
some
sort
of
multilateral
presence
to
try
to
guarantee
the
security
and
the
freedom
from
violence
of
people
on
both
sides
of
the
ledger
while
we
try
to
establish
the
conditions
of
ongoing
civilized
society
but
i
believe
were
going
to
prevail
there
q
mr
president
would
you
care
to
make
your
assessment
of
the
first
days
before
we
make
one
for
you
laughter
the
president
well
ill
say
if
i
believe
first
of
all
we
passed
the
budget
resolution
in
record
time
that
was
the
biggest
issue
that
confirmed
the
direction
of
the
administration
and
confirmed
the
commitments
of
the
campaign
that
we
could
both
bring
the
deficit
down
and
increase
investment
and
that
we
could
do
it
by
specific
spending
cuts
and
by
raising
taxes
almost
all
of
which
come
from
the
highest
income
people
in
this
society
reversing
a
trend
in
which
most
of
the
tax
burdens
were
borne
by
the
middle
class
whose
incomes
were
going
down
when
their
taxes
were
going
up
while
the
deficit
went
from
trillion
to
trillion
the
total
national
debt
and
the
deficit
continued
to
go
up
we
have
a
low
in
interest
rates
from
mortgages
we
have
lower
interest
rates
across
the
board
we
have
tens
of
billions
of
dollars
flooding
back
into
this
economy
as
people
refinance
their
debt
we
have
established
a
new
environmental
policy
which
is
dramatically
different
the
secretary
of
education
has
worked
with
me
and
with
others
and
with
the
governors
to
establish
a
new
approach
in
education
that
focuses
on
tough
standards
as
well
as
increasing
opportunity
we
have
done
an
enormous
amount
of
work
on
political
reform
on
campaign
finance
and
lobbying
reform
and
i
have
imposed
tough
ethics
requirements
on
my
own
administrations
officials
these
things
are
consistent
with
not
only
what
i
said
id
do
in
the
campaign
but
with
turning
the
country
around
the
vice
president
is
heading
a
task
force
which
will
literally
change
the
way
the
federal
government
operates
and
make
it
much
more
responsive
to
the
citizens
of
this
country
we
are
working
on
a
whole
range
of
other
things
the
welfare
reform
initiative
to
move
people
from
welfare
to
work
and
of
course
a
massive
amount
of
work
has
been
done
on
the
health
care
issue
which
is
a
huge
economic
and
personal
security
problem
for
millions
of
americans
so
i
think
it
is
amazing
how
much
has
been
done
more
will
be
done
we
also
passed
the
family
leave
bill
a
version
of
the
motor
voter
bill
that
has
not
come
out
of
conference
back
to
me
yet
and
everything
has
been
passed
except
the
stimulus
program
so
i
think
were
doing
fine
and
were
moving
in
the
right
direction
i
feel
good
about
it
q
sir
a
followup
wouldnt
you
say
though
that
one
of
your
biggest
initiatives
aid
to
soviet
russia
is
now
practically
finished
if
we
cant
pass
a
stimulus
bill
in
our
own
country
how
can
we
do
it
for
them
the
president
let
me
recast
the
question
a
little
bit
its
a
good
question
laughter
its
a
good
question
but
to
be
fair
weve
got
to
recast
it
we
have
already
the
first
round
of
aid
to
the
soviet
to
nonsoviet
russia
to
a
democratic
russia
is
plainly
going
to
go
through
the
first
billion
the
aid
that
we
agreed
with
our
partners
in
the
to
provide
through
the
international
financial
institutions
which
is
a
big
dollar
item
is
plainly
going
to
go
through
the
question
is
can
we
get
any
more
aid
for
russia
that
requires
a
new
appropriation
by
the
united
states
congress
and
that
is
a
question
i
think
mary
that
will
be
resolved
in
the
weeks
ahead
in
part
by
what
happens
to
the
american
workers
and
their
jobs
and
their
future
i
think
the
two
things
will
be
tied
by
many
members
of
congress
q
the
tailhook
report
came
out
this
morning
documenting
horrendous
and
nearlycriminal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
navy
how
much
did
you
discuss
the
incident
and
what
might
be
done
about
it
with
your
nominee
to
be
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
president
first
let
me
comment
a
little
on
that
the
inspector
generals
report
details
conduct
which
is
wrong
and
which
has
no
place
in
the
armed
services
and
i
expect
the
report
to
be
acted
on
in
the
appropriate
way
i
also
want
to
say
to
the
american
people
and
to
all
of
you
that
the
report
should
be
taken
for
what
it
is
a
very
disturbing
list
of
allegations
which
will
have
to
be
thoroughly
examined
it
should
not
be
taken
as
a
general
indictment
of
the
united
states
navy
or
of
all
the
fine
people
who
serve
there
it
is
very
specific
in
its
allegations
and
it
will
be
pursued
the
only
thing
i
said
to
the
secretarydesignate
of
the
navy
and
the
only
thing
i
should
have
said
to
him
i
think
is
that
i
expected
him
to
take
the
report
and
to
do
his
duty
and
i
believe
he
will
do
that
q
mr
president
to
back
to
russia
for
just
a
minute
the
latest
poll
show
that
mr
yeltsin
will
probably
win
his
vote
of
confidence
but
there
seems
to
be
a
real
tossup
on
whether
or
not
voters
are
going
to
endorse
his
economic
reforms
the
president
i
understand
that
q
can
you
live
with
a
split
laughter
can
you
live
with
a
split
decision
though
or
do
you
need
both
passed
in
order
to
then
build
support
for
russian
aid
the
president
i
believe
the
answer
to
your
question
is
for
the
united
states
the
key
question
should
be
that
which
is
posed
to
any
democracy
which
is
who
wins
the
election
if
he
wins
the
election
if
he
is
ratified
by
the
russian
people
to
continue
as
their
president
then
i
think
we
should
do
our
best
to
work
with
him
toward
reform
you
know
we
had
a
lot
of
other
countries
here
for
the
holocaust
museum
dedication
their
leaders
were
here
leaders
from
eastern
europe
leaders
from
at
least
one
republic
of
the
former
soviet
union
all
of
them
having
terrible
economic
challenges
as
they
convert
from
a
communist
command
and
control
economy
to
a
market
economy
in
a
world
where
theres
economic
slowdown
everywhere
and
in
a
world
in
which
theres
economic
slowdown
and
difficulty
all
leaders
will
have
trouble
having
their
policies
be
popular
in
a
poll
because
they
havent
produced
the
results
that
the
people
so
earnestly
yearn
for
you
can
understand
that
but
if
they
have
confidence
in
the
leadership
i
think
thats
all
we
can
ask
and
the
united
states
will
if
the
russian
people
ratify
him
as
their
president
and
stick
with
him
then
the
united
states
will
continue
to
work
with
him
i
think
he
is
a
genuine
democrat
small
d
and
genuinely
committed
to
reform
i
think
that
we
should
support
that
q
mr
president
mr
perot
has
come
out
strongly
in
what
is
perceived
behind
the
line
against
a
free
trade
agreement
nafta
how
hard
are
you
going
to
fight
for
this
free
trade
agreement
and
when
do
you
expect
to
see
it
accomplished
the
president
i
think
well
have
the
agreement
ready
in
the
fairly
near
future
you
know
our
people
are
still
working
with
the
mexican
government
and
with
the
canadians
on
the
side
agreements
were
trying
to
work
out
what
the
environmental
agreement
will
say
what
the
labor
agreement
will
say
and
then
what
the
fairest
way
to
deal
with
enforcement
is
the
mexicans
say
and
there
is
some
merit
to
their
position
that
theyre
worried
about
transferring
their
sovereignty
in
enforcement
to
a
multilateral
commission
even
in
the
united
states
to
be
fair
we
have
some
folks
who
are
worried
about
that
about
giving
that
up
on
the
other
hand
if
were
going
to
have
an
environmental
agreement
and
a
labor
standards
agreement
that
means
something
then
there
has
to
be
ultimately
some
consequences
for
violating
them
so
what
were
trying
to
do
is
to
agree
on
an
approach
which
would
say
that
if
there
is
a
pattern
of
violations
if
you
keep
on
violating
it
past
a
certain
point
maybe
not
an
isolated
incident
but
a
pattern
of
violation
there
is
going
to
be
some
enforcement
there
must
be
consequences
and
were
working
out
the
details
of
that
but
i
still
feel
quite
good
about
it
and
this
is
just
an
area
where
i
disagree
with
mr
perot
and
with
others
i
think
that
we
will
win
big
if
we
have
a
fair
agreement
that
integrates
more
closely
the
mexican
economy
and
the
american
economy
and
leads
us
from
there
to
chile
to
other
market
economies
in
latin
america
and
gives
us
a
bigger
world
in
which
to
trade
i
think
thats
the
only
way
a
rich
country
can
grow
richer
if
you
look
at
what
japan
and
other
countries
in
the
pacific
are
doing
to
reach
out
in
their
own
region
its
a
pretty
good
lesson
to
us
that
we
had
better
worry
about
how
to
build
those
bridges
in
our
own
area
so
this
is
an
idea
battle
you
know
youve
got
a
lot
of
questions
and
i
want
to
answer
them
all
but
let
me
say
not
every
one
of
these
things
can
be
distilled
simply
into
politics
you
know
whos
for
this
and
whos
for
that
and
if
this
person
is
for
this
somebody
else
has
got
to
be
for
that
a
lot
of
these
things
honestly
involved
real
debates
over
ideas
over
whos
right
and
wrong
about
the
world
toward
which
were
moving
and
the
answers
are
not
selfevident
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
wanted
to
run
for
president
is
i
wanted
to
sort
of
open
the
floodgates
for
debating
these
ideas
so
that
we
could
try
to
change
in
the
appropriate
way
so
i
just
have
a
difference
of
opinion
i
believe
that
the
concept
of
nafta
is
sound
even
though
as
you
know
i
thought
that
the
details
needed
to
be
improved
q
mr
president
there
was
a
tremendous
flurry
of
interest
earlier
this
month
in
the
russian
document
that
purported
to
show
that
the
vietnamese
had
held
back
american
prisoners
general
vessey
has
now
said
publicly
that
while
the
document
itself
was
authentic
he
believes
that
it
was
incorrect
do
you
have
a
personal
view
at
this
point
about
that
issue
and
more
broadly
do
you
believe
that
in
fact
the
vietnamese
did
return
all
the
american
prisoners
at
the
time
of
the
paris
peace
accord
the
president
first
let
me
say
i
saw
general
vessey
before
he
went
to
vietnam
and
after
he
returned
and
i
have
a
high
regard
for
him
and
i
appreciate
his
willingness
to
serve
his
country
in
this
way
as
to
whether
the
document
had
any
basis
in
fact
let
me
say
that
the
government
of
vietnam
was
more
forthcoming
than
it
had
been
in
the
past
and
gave
us
some
documents
that
would
tend
to
undermine
the
validity
of
the
russian
documents
claim
i
do
not
know
whether
that
is
right
or
wrong
we
are
having
it
basically
evaluated
at
this
time
and
when
we
complete
the
evaluation
well
tell
you
and
of
course
we
want
to
tell
the
families
of
those
who
were
missing
in
action
or
who
were
pows
i
think
that
well
be
able
to
make
some
progress
in
eliminating
some
of
the
questions
about
the
outstanding
cases
as
a
result
of
this
last
interchange
but
i
cannot
say
that
im
fully
satisfied
that
we
know
all
that
we
need
to
know
there
are
still
some
cases
that
we
dont
know
the
answer
to
but
i
do
believe
were
making
some
progress
i
was
encouraged
by
the
last
trip
q
id
like
to
follow
up
on
that
before
the
us
normalizes
relations
allows
trade
to
go
forward
do
you
have
to
be
personally
sure
that
every
case
has
been
resolved
or
would
you
be
willing
to
go
forward
on
the
basis
that
while
it
may
take
years
to
resolve
these
cases
the
vietnamese
have
made
sufficient
offerings
to
us
to
confirm
good
faith
the
president
a
lot
of
experts
say
you
can
never
resolve
every
case
every
one
that
we
couldnt
resolve
all
the
cases
for
them
and
that
there
are
still
some
cases
that
have
not
been
factually
resolved
going
back
to
the
second
world
war
but
what
i
would
have
to
be
convinced
of
is
that
we
had
gone
a
long
way
toward
resolving
every
case
that
could
be
resolved
at
this
moment
in
time
and
that
there
was
a
complete
open
and
unrestricted
commitment
to
continue
to
do
everything
that
could
be
done
always
to
keep
resolving
those
cases
and
were
not
there
yet
again
i
have
to
be
guided
a
little
bit
by
people
who
know
a
lot
about
this
and
i
confess
to
being
much
more
heavily
influenced
by
the
families
of
the
people
whose
lives
were
lost
there
or
whose
lives
remain
in
question
than
by
the
commercial
interest
and
the
other
things
which
seem
so
compelling
in
this
moment
i
just
am
very
influenced
by
how
the
families
feel
q
your
economic
stimulus
package
are
you
doing
some
kind
of
reality
check
now
and
scaling
back
some
of
your
plans
your
legislative
plans
for
the
coming
year
including
the
crime
bill
the
health
care
initiative
and
other
things
are
there
any
plans
to
do
that
and
also
did
you
underestimate
the
power
of
senator
bob
dole
the
president
no
what
i
underestimated
was
the
extent
to
which
what
i
thought
was
a
fairly
selfevident
case
particularly
after
we
stayed
below
the
spending
caps
approved
by
this
congress
including
the
republicans
who
were
in
this
congress
last
year
when
we
had
already
passed
a
budget
resolution
which
called
for
over
billion
in
deficit
reduction
when
they
had
voted
repeatedly
for
supplemental
appropriations
to
help
foreign
governments
i
thought
at
least
four
of
them
would
vote
to
break
cloture
and
i
underestimated
that
i
did
not
have
an
adequate
strategy
of
dealing
with
that
i
also
thought
that
if
i
made
a
goodfaith
effort
to
negotiate
and
to
compromise
that
it
would
not
be
rebuffed
instead
every
time
i
offered
something
they
reduced
the
offer
that
they
had
previously
been
talking
to
the
majority
leader
about
so
it
was
a
strange
set
of
events
but
i
think
what
happened
was
what
was
a
significant
part
of
our
plan
but
not
the
major
part
of
it
acquired
a
political
connotation
that
got
out
of
proportion
to
the
merits
so
that
a
lot
of
republicans
were
saying
to
me
privately
mr
president
id
like
to
be
for
this
but
i
cant
now
and
were
all
strung
out
and
were
divided
and
i
think
we
need
to
do
a
reality
check
as
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
let
me
go
back
to
what
i
said
what
i
want
to
know
from
our
folks
and
from
our
friends
in
the
senate
on
and
republicans
or
democrats
is
what
could
i
have
done
differently
to
make
it
come
out
differently
because
the
real
losers
here
were
not
the
president
and
the
administration
the
real
losers
were
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
wont
have
jobs
now
we
could
have
put
another
kids
to
work
this
summer
i
mean
we
could
have
done
a
lot
of
good
things
with
that
money
and
i
think
that
is
very
very
sad
and
it
became
more
political
than
it
should
have
but
the
underlying
rationale
i
dont
think
holds
a
lot
of
water
that
it
was
deficit
spending
that
just
wont
wash
q
and
redo
the
president
no
i
mean
you
know
for
example
you
mentioned
the
crime
bill
i
think
it
would
be
a
real
mistake
not
to
pass
the
crime
bill
i
mean
the
crime
bill
was
almost
on
the
point
of
passage
last
year
and
they
were
all
fighting
over
the
brady
bill
surely
surely
after
what
we
have
been
through
in
this
country
just
in
the
last
three
months
with
the
kind
of
mindless
violence
we
have
seen
we
can
pass
a
bill
requiring
people
to
go
through
a
waiting
period
before
they
buy
a
handgun
and
surely
we
can
see
that
we
need
more
police
officers
on
the
street
thats
another
thing
that
i
really
believe
that
once
we
move
some
of
that
money
not
all
but
some
of
it
up
into
this
jobs
package
to
make
some
of
the
jobs
rehiring
police
officers
on
the
street
whod
been
laid
off
that
would
be
a
compelling
case
i
mean
people
are
scared
in
this
country
and
i
think
we
need
to
go
forward
i
feel
very
strongly
that
we
need
to
go
forward
on
the
crime
bill
q
mr
president
back
to
the
tailhook
report
for
a
second
that
report
contained
very
strong
criticism
of
the
navys
senior
leadership
in
general
but
did
not
name
any
of
the
senior
officers
do
you
believe
that
the
senior
officers
who
are
implicated
in
this
including
admiral
kelso
who
was
there
one
night
in
las
vegas
should
they
be
disciplined
and
do
you
believe
the
public
has
a
right
to
know
the
names
of
the
senior
officers
the
president
you
should
know
that
under
the
rules
of
law
which
apply
to
this
i
am
in
the
chain
of
command
there
is
now
an
inspector
generals
report
and
the
law
must
take
its
course
if
i
were
to
answer
that
question
i
might
prejudice
any
decisions
which
might
be
later
made
in
this
case
i
dont
really
think
i
think
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
i
have
already
said
i
was
very
disturbed
by
the
specific
allegations
in
the
inspector
generals
report
and
i
want
appropriate
action
to
be
taken
until
the
proper
procedures
have
a
chance
to
kick
in
and
appropriate
action
is
taken
i
have
been
advised
that
because
i
am
the
commanderinchief
i
have
to
be
very
careful
about
what
i
say
so
as
not
to
prejudice
the
rights
of
anybody
against
whom
any
action
might
proceed
or
to
prejudice
the
case
in
any
other
way
either
pro
or
con
so
i
cant
say
any
more
except
to
say
that
i
want
this
thing
handled
in
an
appropriate
and
thorough
way
q
mr
president
could
i
ask
you
for
a
clarification
on
bosnia
you
said
that
you
were
not
considering
introduction
of
american
forces
does
that
include
any
air
forces
as
well
as
ground
forces
sir
the
president
i
said
ground
forces
q
you
said
ground
forces
could
i
ask
you
sir
if
you
fear
that
using
us
air
strikes
might
draw
the
united
states
into
a
ground
war
there
the
president
i
just
dont
want
to
discuss
our
evaluation
of
the
options
anymore
ive
told
you
that
theres
never
been
a
serious
discussion
in
this
country
about
the
introduction
of
ground
forces
into
an
ongoing
conflict
there
q
with
hundreds
of
thousands
of
gays
in
washington
this
weekend
for
the
march
did
you
ever
reconsider
your
decision
to
leave
town
for
this
weekend
did
you
ever
consider
in
any
way
participating
in
some
of
the
activities
the
president
no
q
why
not
the
president
because
i
and
basically
i
wouldnt
participate
in
other
marches
i
think
once
you
become
president
on
balance
except
under
unusual
circumstances
that
is
not
what
should
be
done
but
more
importantly
im
going
to
the
american
society
of
newspaper
editors
a
trip
that
presumably
most
of
you
would
want
me
to
make
to
try
to
focus
anew
on
what
i
think
are
the
fundamental
issues
at
stake
for
our
country
right
now
and
i
expect
that
i
will
say
something
about
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
americans
have
come
here
asking
for
a
climate
that
is
free
of
discrimination
asking
basically
to
be
able
to
work
hard
and
live
by
the
rules
and
be
treated
like
other
american
citizens
if
they
do
that
and
just
that
and
thats
always
been
my
position
not
only
for
the
gays
who
will
be
here
but
for
others
as
well
thank
you
very
much

god
created

for

i
pray
for
him
to
find
in
his

the
christian
values
he
espouses
so
that
he
can
learn

love
his

has
an

in
his

is
as
valid
as
any
opinion
anyone
else
on

has

you
were

to
talk

do

turn

at

suggested
a

i
for

of
people
on

an

may
freely
choose
suicide
but
they
have
no

this
choice
on

while
i
dont

i
have

on

do
expect

to

it
out

that
their

tactics
played
perfectly
into

mad
view
of
the

and
so
increased
the
chance
of
a
tragic
outcome
some
responses
have
gone
so
far
to
suggest
that
the

were
done
without

nontoxic
teargas
is
an
oxymoron
children
have
tiny
respiratory
passages
which
are
easily
blocked
by
the
secretions
induced
by
teargas
moreover
teargas
can
easily
cause
fatalities
in
anyone
subject
to
laryngospasms
asthma
or
heart
disease
if
a
madman
is
holding
a

to
a

someone
who
provokes
the
madman
by
attacking
him
bears
nearly
as
much
repsonsibility
for
the
death
of
the
hostage
as
the
madman
himself
these
kinds
of
situations
have
to
be
handled
delicately
not
by
surrounding
a

with
tanks
and
heavily
armed
personnel
and

the

the

were
killed
in
the

of

trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry

ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at

the

the

made
every
reasonable

to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the

a

from
another
relic
of
the
past
the
selective

system
creates
jobs
and
is
an

in
the

of

whats
wrong
with
that
do
we
want
to
create

or
do
we
want
jobs
created
that
are
productive
in
our
supplydemand
economy
if
your
answer
is
the
former
then
we
can
just
round
up
all
jobless
people
and
pay
them
to
build
sandcastles
in
the
desert
if
you
answer
the
latter
then
i
fail
to
see
how
another
bureaucracy
produces
anything
we
need
jobs
because
at
this
point
in
the
recovery
the
economy
should
have
generated
billion
jobs
and
since
it
has
not
the
government
has
to
step
in
and
help
shutting
down
selective
service
would
cost
good
jobs
and
we
cant
do
that
what
we
really
need
is
to
involve
selective

in
a
more
closely
directed
manner
we
need
the
selective

involved
in
environmental
protection
highspeed

commuter

civil

national

and
health

every
dollar
we
put

now
will

really

to
think
about

what

looking

they

as

as
i
could
tell
they
relied
on
their
professional

in
the

to
provide
the

numbers
if
so
this
would
hardly
represent

i

at

asking

but
answer
came
there
none
i
must
have
been
out
of
my
mind
for
even
asking
for
factual
information
on

no
one
is
presumably
going

say
theyre
gay
if
theyre
not
but
some
no
doubt
are
going
to
hide
their
homosexuality
in
surveys
thus
the
is
a
lower
limit
this
is
the
problem
people
have
to
have
a

of
confidence
in
the
anonymity
of
a

before
they
can
counted
on
to
speak
freely
about
stuff
like
that

i
agree
that
if
someones
going
to
lie
it
will
be
in
the
direction
of
a
gay
person
claiming
to
be
straight
rather
than
the
other
way
around
i
still
say
that
weighing
all
the
evidence
gives
a
most
likely
percentage
between
and
i
dont
see
why
theres
any
more
evidence
for
this

to

the

what

the

youd
have
to
take

even
you

id

differ
the

the

is
largely
with

having
kept
up
with
this

on

for
some

just
about
all
the
criticism

room
pm

mr
stephanopoulos
as
you
know
the
president
is
going
to
come
out
at
pm
with
your
indulgence
i
think
what
wed
like
to
do
is
have
the
president
award
the
national
teachers
award
first
and
then
have
the
teacher
leave
or
whatever
and
then
hell
make
a
statement
on
waco
and
take
a
couple
questions
so
if
we
can
just
hold
off
going
live
and
all
that
until
thats
done
it
probably
will
work
out
a
lot
better
q
if
youll
give
us
the
time
thats
the
problem
q
weve
got
a
twominute
warning
problem
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
it
is
a
problem
its
about
pm
q
the
teacher
would
walk
off
and
then
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
im
just
trying
to
work
this
out
here
i
think
thats
the
best
way
to
handle
it
q
can
i
ask
you
a
series
of
questions
about
the
way
the
president
handled
the
notifications
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
sure
q
did
you
for
instance
talk
to
the
justice
department
about
who
would
come
out
and
discuss
what
had
happened
in
waco
and
whether
it
should
be
the
attorney
general
or
the
president
mr
stephanopoulos
why
dont
we
just
take
a
step
even
farther
back
from
that
and
look
at
the
whole
sequence
of
events
on
the
contact
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
as
you
know
and
as
weve
said
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
on
sunday
sunday
afternoon
they
had
a
good
discussion
about
minutes
the
attorney
general
informed
the
president
of
what
she
wanted
to
do
he
raised
no
objections
obviously
she
had
the
implicit
authority
from
the
president
to
go
forward
he
raised
no
objections
she
went
forward
they
had
a
discussion
of
a
general
nature
about
the
incident
again
yesterday
morning
around
am
the
president
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
they
had
a
brief
discussion
over
what
was
happening
in
waco
as
you
know
this
was
before
the
fire
broke
out
at
the
compound
and
i
think
that
was
why
there
was
some
just
some
confusion
i
think
that
she
was
confusing
in
her
minds
before
and
after
the
fire
not
the
actual
day
when
they
spoke
then
there
was
a
number
of
contacts
at
a
number
of
different
levels
in
the
white
house
yesterday
afternoon
between
the
justice
department
and
the
white
house
they
were
informing
us
of
their
decisions
what
they
would
like
to
do
there
was
an
fbi
briefing
in
waco
the
attorney
general
had
her
press
conference
the
president
then
issued
a
statement
after
that
frankly
yesterday
afternoon
you
know
there
was
a
fair
amount
of
confusion
over
exactly
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
and
i
think
that
we
wanted
to
be
very
careful
not
to
have
the
president
say
anything
until
we
had
a
much
better
sense
of
what
was
actually
happening
on
the
ground
once
we
were
fairly
clear
on
what
was
happening
on
the
ground
in
waco
the
president
issued
a
statement
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
again
yesterday
evening
q
at
what
hour
was
that
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
quite
late
i
believe
it
was
after
he
returned
from
the
holocaust
museum
he
took
a
tour
of
the
holocaust
museum
last
night
q
and
he
went
out
to
dinner
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
briefly
yes
he
went
to
dinner
and
then
he
spoke
with
the
attorney
general
last
night
i
dont
know
the
exact
time
i
think
it
was
relatively
late
and
he
just
said
i
think
as
dee
dee
has
reported
that
he
just
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
thought
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
very
well
that
she
did
a
good
job
in
a
tough
situation
and
that
she
should
try
and
get
some
sleep
he
then
again
spoke
with
her
this
morning
about
the
followup
in
waco
and
about
what
theyre
going
to
do
this
afternoon
as
you
know
the
president
will
have
an
announcement
to
make
at
q
did
he
ever
talk
with
webb
hubbell
yesterday
last
night
or
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
no
q
was
webb
hubbell
the
point
man
for
the
white
house
mr
stephanopoulos
webb
hubbell
is
the
general
white
house
liaison
and
several
people
talked
to
webb
the
attorney
general
was
running
the
operation
q
did
he
tell
her
that
she
should
sleep
well
that
she
had
done
a
good
job
or
he
just
tell
her
that
she
should
get
some
sleep
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
sleep
well
done
a
good
job
i
dont
know
the
exact
words
i
think
that
sounds
right
q
i
mean
sleep
well
has
implications
as
to
conscience
and
whether
she
should
feel
badly
about
it
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
mean
i
think
everybody
feels
badly
when
you
have
a
situation
when
q
i
understand
that
but
whether
the
issue
of
blame
is
brought
up
in
that
phraseology
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
the
spirit
no
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
spirit
with
which
it
was
offered
was
that
the
entire
administration
and
certainly
the
attorney
general
had
to
face
a
very
difficult
decision
a
very
difficult
situation
yesterday
and
that
he
thought
that
she
had
handled
it
well
as
best
as
she
could
and
q
well
does
he
think
it
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
it
was
just
speaking
of
warm
words
to
a
friend
q
does
he
think
the
situation
was
mishandled
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
q
in
retrospect
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
stands
by
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
the
decisions
of
the
attorney
general
he
accepts
full
responsibility
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
we
all
want
to
look
to
the
future
and
figure
out
what
exactly
happened
do
a
full
review
and
make
sure
we
do
what
we
can
to
make
sure
this
doesnt
happen
this
kind
of
thing
doesnt
happen
again
or
at
least
we
know
how
to
handle
it
q
how
much
did
he
know
about
what
she
was
going
to
go
ahead
with
i
know
that
she
made
the
case
to
him
explained
outlined
the
case
for
action
did
she
say
to
him
on
sunday
precisely
what
action
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
think
it
was
specific
operational
detail
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
i
think
that
they
had
a
general
discussion
about
the
action
about
the
advisability
of
action
i
think
as
she
noted
he
asked
a
few
general
questions
just
trying
to
get
a
sense
of
how
things
were
considered
but
it
wasnt
minutebyminute
detail
of
how
the
operation
q
well
was
it
we
are
going
in
is
it
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
i
mean
what
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
it
was
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
some
action
that
would
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
hopefully
spur
them
towards
some
sort
of
movement
out
q
george
was
there
ever
a
conscious
political
decision
made
or
even
a
discussion
about
distancing
the
president
from
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
we
were
in
close
contact
with
the
justice
department
the
president
accepts
responsibility
for
this
at
the
same
time
i
mean
we
just
wanted
to
be
very
very
clear
about
how
this
happened
and
be
as
factual
as
we
could
be
on
how
the
decisions
were
made
it
is
the
responsibility
of
those
on
the
ground
to
make
recommendations
the
attorney
general
has
operational
control
over
this
the
president
obviously
accepts
responsibility
for
all
of
this
and
he
stands
by
the
attorney
general
q
george
there
was
a
report
on
the
television
today
and
i
dont
know
more
than
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
cult
had
said
going
into
a
courthouse
that
the
fbi
had
started
the
fire
and
not
themselves
there
was
also
a
picture
yesterday
on
the
tv
of
a
smashing
into
the
building
where
the
fire
broke
out
and
my
question
is
is
the
white
house
absolutely
certain
that
this
fire
was
mr
stephanopoulos
all
the
evidence
we
have
is
that
this
fire
was
started
by
david
koresh
and
those
inside
the
compound
every
bit
of
evidence
we
have
q
did
the
president
ask
the
attorney
general
why
do
this
now
why
this
particular
date
and
did
he
ask
about
possible
consequences
of
either
death
or
injury
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
the
specific
questions
he
had
general
questions
about
how
the
decision
was
going
about
being
made
q
those
are
general
questions
and
did
he
ask
generally
why
now
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
asked
have
you
considered
all
of
the
consequences
have
you
considered
the
recommendations
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
the
question
why
now
i
dont
know
if
he
asked
that
specific
question
q
did
she
tell
him
why
now
in
terms
of
the
stuff
thats
come
out
since
then
about
the
information
provided
by
the
listening
device
about
koresh
getting
increasingly
more
violent
mr
stephanopoulos
again
im
not
certain
how
much
specific
detail
they
got
into
i
know
that
she
generally
said
that
this
is
the
recommendation
shes
prepared
to
make
i
mean
the
decision
shes
prepared
to
make
its
based
on
the
recommendations
she
was
receiving
from
the
field
and
after
intensive
questioning
of
those
involved
again
i
do
not
know
how
precisely
detailed
it
was
beyond
that
q
what
is
the
presidents
understanding
why
yesterday
one
of
the
people
who
went
into
the
compound
a
couple
weeks
ago
came
out
over
the
weekend
with
some
speculation
that
he
may
have
told
law
enforcement
people
something
that
precipitated
this
action
why
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
i
think
what
we
can
go
to
is
what
the
fbi
and
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
were
indications
that
those
inside
the
compound
were
at
some
danger
it
was
clear
that
the
negotiations
had
broken
down
and
it
was
the
judgment
of
the
experts
involved
in
the
negotiations
that
the
situation
was
not
going
to
get
any
better
at
all
there
was
also
some
concern
over
the
vulnerability
of
the
agents
themselves
who
had
been
working
long
beyond
the
time
that
these
teams
normally
have
to
work
and
as
the
attorney
general
has
said
there
was
some
concern
over
the
fact
that
they
did
not
have
replacements
in
place
who
could
stand
in
for
them
and
there
was
a
concern
over
the
safety
all
of
these
factors
came
into
play
they
also
considered
the
advice
of
a
number
of
psychologists
and
other
experts
on
david
koresh
and
those
in
the
compound
i
would
just
go
back
to
what
the
attorney
general
has
said
you
have
to
make
the
best
judgment
you
can
given
the
information
you
have
at
the
time
they
did
obviously
we
all
regret
the
loss
of
life
its
a
terribly
unfortunate
situation
we
all
wish
it
could
have
turned
out
differently
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
judgments
that
were
made
at
the
time
q
george
when
did
the
president
know
that
they
were
going
to
use
tear
gas
was
it
before
the
assault
on
the
compound
mr
stephanopoulos
i
just
dont
know
i
dont
believe
he
was
given
a
lot
of
detail
on
exactly
how
the
operation
would
go
i
just
dont
know
q
along
that
point
george
can
you
say
whether
the
plan
was
presented
to
the
president
by
the
attorney
general
as
a
way
to
end
the
standoff
one
way
or
the
other
yesterday
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
presented
as
a
way
to
increase
the
pressure
on
those
in
the
compound
and
we
all
hoped
as
a
way
to
move
some
of
those
out
and
bring
it
in
it
wasnt
presented
as
tomorrow
is
dday
this
is
it
q
is
the
president
satisfied
that
a
he
had
all
this
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
and
b
that
janet
reno
had
all
the
relevant
information
necessary
to
make
a
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
oh
i
think
hes
satisfied
that
they
were
acting
on
the
best
advice
and
the
best
information
they
had
and
hes
not
secondguessing
it
in
any
way
whatsoever
q
george
was
there
a
gap
between
conversations
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
in
other
words
they
spoke
at
am
and
they
didnt
speak
again
until
clinton
got
back
from
dinner
at
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
thats
likely
yes
q
did
he
call
her
what
time
did
she
call
was
there
a
gap
between
when
she
called
him
i
mean
was
he
at
dinner
when
she
called
and
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
no
i
think
he
called
her
last
night
i
couldnt
swear
to
it
but
i
believe
he
called
her
last
night
he
just
wanted
to
talk
to
her
q
what
was
going
on
mr
stephanopoulos
not
that
i
know
of
no
q
what
do
you
know
about
the
situation
now
everyone
has
perished
who
except
eight
or
nine
and
do
you
know
any
of
the
other
details
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
any
more
details
than
the
fbi
reported
in
waco
q
watching
cnn
or
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
is
going
on
if
he
wasnt
talking
to
his
attorney
general
how
was
he
keeping
track
of
what
was
going
on
here
i
mean
with
all
due
respect
to
cnn
is
that
how
he
was
doing
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
there
was
also
as
i
said
several
people
in
the
white
house
were
in
constant
contact
with
their
counterparts
at
justice
to
have
the
full
and
complete
information
q
who
were
those
contacts
i
mean
was
it
mack
mclarty
webb
hubbell
how
was
the
president
being
kept
informed
thats
not
a
mr
stephanopoulos
i
believe
mack
was
in
contact
with
webb
i
spoke
with
several
people
at
the
justice
department
i
believe
bruce
lindsey
spoke
with
people
at
the
justice
department
either
bernie
or
vince
was
also
in
contact
at
different
times
during
the
day
with
people
at
the
justice
department
we
were
fully
briefed
and
fully
informed
q
we
were
told
this
morning
that
the
president
may
have
spoken
a
chance
that
he
may
have
spoken
with
webb
do
you
know
if
thats
true
or
not
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
theres
a
chance
he
may
have
i
dont
believe
he
did
but
i
think
theres
certainly
a
chance
that
he
may
have
at
some
point
i
dont
believe
he
did
i
think
that
the
last
contact
he
had
during
the
day
yesterday
directly
with
the
justice
department
was
the
am
phone
call
with
the
attorney
general
but
the
white
house
was
fully
informed
on
a
minutetominute
basis
of
what
was
happening
in
waco
and
what
was
happening
at
the
justice
department
q
george
who
decided
that
the
briefing
would
be
done
by
the
attorney
general
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
q
did
you
or
did
the
white
house
communications
staff
were
you
ever
involved
with
that
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
no
we
were
told
about
it
q
did
you
ask
her
to
go
on
nightline
and
macneil
lehrer
and
all
that
stuff
was
that
part
of
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
there
was
no
advice
from
the
white
house
at
all
about
her
she
was
on
all
night
all
day
laughter
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
and
she
did
a
very
good
job
q
why
did
you
decide
to
have
the
presidents
reaction
to
the
situation
be
only
a
written
statement
which
is
traditionally
the
white
houses
way
of
distancing
the
president
from
the
issue
not
having
him
appear
as
personally
saying
anything
mr
stephanopoulos
well
that
wasnt
the
intent
at
all
as
i
said
we
had
to
we
wanted
to
wait
until
we
had
all
of
the
information
at
hand
the
president
is
also
making
a
statement
today
the
president
made
a
statement
yesterday
morning
the
president
has
been
fully
involved
q
after
this
turned
into
less
than
a
successful
operation
the
only
statement
from
the
president
was
what
was
on
paper
after
the
attorney
general
had
already
given
what
amounted
to
the
major
facts
in
this
mr
stephanopoulos
well
it
was
the
first
statement
from
the
president
not
the
only
statement
from
the
president
number
one
q
after
the
mr
stephanopoulos
number
two
well
the
first
number
two
the
attorney
general
q
he
gave
a
statement
early
in
the
morning
when
the
thing
was
starting
to
move
mr
stephanopoulos
right
and
he
gave
one
yesterday
and
hes
giving
one
today
now
the
second
point
q
it
just
happens
this
was
a
written
statement
with
no
sort
of
communications
policy
or
thought
process
involved
it
was
the
president
wants
to
put
out
a
written
statement
mr
stephanopoulos
knowing
what
we
knew
at
the
time
we
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
the
president
and
he
thought
it
was
appropriate
to
put
out
a
written
statement
expressing
his
regret
and
expressing
his
support
for
the
attorney
generals
q
why
was
it
not
appropriate
for
him
to
personally
do
something
mr
stephanopoulos
well
he
did
personally
do
so
that
is
his
statement
its
a
statement
under
his
name
q
george
yesterday
during
the
briefing
you
didnt
say
the
president
took
full
responsibility
for
what
happened
mr
stephanopoulos
i
certainly
did
q
no
what
you
said
was
mr
stephanopoulos
thats
just
not
right
susan
q
well
i
think
you
can
go
back
to
the
transcript
i
mean
unless
i
miss
something
mr
stephanopoulos
id
love
to
q
janet
reno
said
that
she
took
full
responsibility
and
you
said
that
she
made
the
decision
that
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
and
the
president
takes
responsibility
absolutely
q
took
responsibility
all
right
mr
stephanopoulos
check
the
transcript
q
considering
how
little
was
known
about
what
was
going
on
inside
the
compound
and
even
now
how
little
is
known
why
is
washington
calling
this
a
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
that
knowing
what
we
know
now
and
given
all
of
the
actions
of
david
koresh
before
and
during
it
is
painfully
clear
that
those
there
were
under
his
control
q
its
stretching
it
a
little
bit
where
the
kids
are
concerned
though
isnt
it
george
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
matter
i
mean
i
think
that
david
koresh
must
bear
responsibility
for
the
deaths
of
those
children
absolutely
but
he
clearly
was
intent
on
creating
some
kind
of
an
apocalyptic
incident
and
thats
what
he
did
q
youre
still
operating
completely
on
assumption
right
i
mean
you
have
no
evidence
or
you
know
of
no
evidence
that
this
was
mass
suicide
mr
stephanopoulos
we
have
evidence
that
those
inside
the
compound
set
fire
to
the
compound
which
led
to
the
deaths
of
those
inside
q
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
this
might
be
anns
question
i
didnt
quite
hear
it
but
at
what
time
did
clinton
himself
put
out
a
statement
on
this
i
know
dee
dee
said
some
stuff
on
this
at
pm
but
the
president
put
out
mr
stephanopoulos
at
pm
pm
q
right
after
the
evening
news
went
on
the
air
mr
stephanopoulos
no
right
when
we
had
all
the
information
we
were
working
on
it
q
dee
dee
confirmed
this
morning
that
the
investigation
the
president
is
going
to
announce
is
going
to
be
an
administrationrun
investigation
why
not
have
someone
from
the
outside
to
make
sure
that
its
not
colored
by
those
who
would
have
a
political
stake
particularly
those
at
the
atf
whose
actions
have
already
been
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
that
clearly
the
atf
and
the
justice
department
will
bear
responsibility
for
the
investigation
thats
not
to
rule
out
as
is
often
in
investigations
like
this
having
some
sort
of
independent
involvement
as
well
but
it
will
be
run
by
the
treasury
and
justice
q
are
you
confident
that
you
will
not
have
any
problem
getting
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
q
george
did
the
president
reach
out
to
anybody
else
to
get
advice
after
the
meeting
with
janet
reno
and
who
else
in
the
white
house
sat
in
on
that
meeting
anyone
else
from
justice
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
anybody
else
was
there
at
the
time
it
was
a
phone
call
on
monday
it
wasnt
a
meeting
q
sunday
mr
stephanopoulos
sunday
it
was
a
phone
call
it
wasnt
a
meeting
i
believe
he
might
have
been
there
with
bruce
but
beyond
that
i
think
he
just
talked
to
the
attorney
general
q
george
you
said
that
in
that
phone
call
she
said
that
we
want
to
go
in
and
take
action
as
you
said
that
will
force
him
out
what
did
he
think
she
was
talking
about
if
he
didnt
know
about
tear
gas
what
exactly
was
his
idea
of
what
he
was
approving
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
was
approving
an
action
to
increase
the
pressure
on
it
didnt
matter
how
she
did
that
mr
stephanopoulos
no
no
i
mean
q
what
information
did
he
have
in
terms
of
how
this
would
proceed
presumably
he
would
have
wanted
to
know
not
minute
byminute
but
in
a
general
sense
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
knew
that
this
was
the
recommendation
of
those
on
the
ground
and
the
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
i
just
dont
know
q
what
is
this
when
you
say
that
this
was
the
recommendation
mr
stephanopoulos
the
action
to
increase
pressure
i
dont
know
exactly
what
he
was
told
whether
he
was
going
to
be
told
that
the
tank
was
going
to
go
up
to
the
left
wall
and
punch
a
hole
in
the
window
or
whether
he
was
just
told
generally
that
they
were
moving
forward
in
a
way
that
would
increase
the
pressure
i
just
dont
know
q
its
hard
to
imagine
him
not
asking
though
q
that
janet
reno
presented
him
with
as
her
best
advice
about
what
they
should
go
forward
with
he
would
have
agreed
mr
stephanopoulos
he
was
he
did
ask
some
general
questions
about
the
advice
and
recommendation
he
gave
at
the
same
time
and
i
would
repeat
that
this
was
based
on
the
unanimous
recommendation
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
q
george
it
would
seem
that
this
question
about
just
exactly
in
what
detail
the
president
was
informed
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
is
going
to
come
up
again
here
and
elsewhere
can
you
take
that
question
and
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
yes
q
get
the
answer
and
come
back
to
us
with
all
of
it
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
can
you
tell
us
that
there
was
never
a
meeting
a
strategy
session
where
you
and
others
decided
we
will
put
out
a
written
statement
from
the
president
and
we
will
have
janet
reno
be
on
all
of
these
television
broadcasts
mr
stephanopoulos
never
never
q
and
you
never
called
the
justice
department
and
said
to
anyone
or
janet
reno
youre
the
one
who
needs
to
be
out
front
explaining
this
mr
stephanopoulos
not
once
q
it
just
happened
that
way
that
she
was
the
spokesman
that
no
one
ever
saw
bill
sessions
until
mr
stephanopoulos
she
made
a
decision
as
attorney
general
that
it
was
important
for
her
as
the
operational
officer
in
charge
as
the
person
who
made
the
decision
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
on
this
tragic
incident
q
she
had
no
guidance
from
the
white
house
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
didnt
object
q
but
did
you
laughter
no
im
sure
you
didnt
object
but
did
you
suggest
it
was
this
a
plan
mr
stephanopoulos
no
absolutely
not
q
a
strategy
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
clear
it
mr
stephanopoulos
no
q
did
she
notify
you
mr
stephanopoulos
we
certainly
knew
about
it
q
what
happened
to
this
great
detailed
process
you
have
for
clearing
and
talking
to
every
public
information
officer
and
every
under
every
rock
and
every
place
in
government
that
something
as
major
as
this
could
have
occurred
without
a
discussion
between
you
and
the
public
information
people
at
least
at
the
justice
department
mr
stephanopoulos
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
and
the
attorney
general
wanted
to
go
forward
it
seemed
like
a
good
decision
it
was
a
good
decision
she
did
a
good
job
q
let
me
ask
it
this
way
george
if
in
hindsight
how
you
would
handle
it
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
handled
very
well
q
you
wouldnt
change
a
thing
if
mr
stephanopoulos
change
what
q
the
way
the
white
house
handled
any
part
of
it
from
start
to
finish
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
think
thats
an
awful
broad
question
and
were
certainly
going
to
have
a
review
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
investigation
is
to
look
for
ways
in
the
future
that
something
like
this
see
what
we
can
learn
from
an
incident
like
this
and
see
what
we
can
learn
about
how
to
handle
them
if
youre
talking
specifically
about
the
issue
of
the
press
conferences
no
there
wouldnt
make
any
change
at
all
q
two
questions
first
of
all
on
her
going
on
tv
no
white
house
people
or
outside
media
consultants
came
up
with
this
idea
its
just
very
reminiscent
of
what
you
guys
did
during
the
campaign
mr
stephanopoulos
how
so
q
im
thinking
of
like
watching
clinton
on
nightline
after
the
draft
story
watching
clinton
on
mr
stephanopoulos
theres
absolutely
no
comparison
yesterday
there
was
a
law
enforcement
incident
the
incident
ended
in
tragic
deaths
of
many
many
people
the
attorney
general
was
involved
in
that
decision
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
to
do
that
she
felt
it
was
her
responsibility
in
the
interest
of
public
information
to
go
out
and
take
the
questions
of
the
press
in
order
to
make
sure
that
all
of
the
questions
were
answered
and
she
did
a
fantastic
job
q
the
second
question
is
did
as
someone
who
knows
clinton
as
well
as
you
do
can
you
understand
why
its
sort
of
hard
to
believe
that
he
might
not
have
asked
some
detailed
questions
about
what
she
intended
to
do
in
other
words
she
came
and
she
said
im
going
to
put
pressure
on
them
its
hard
not
to
see
clinton
whos
fairly
intelligent
and
inquisitive
asking
how
q
what
kind
mr
stephanopoulos
both
the
attorney
general
said
that
he
did
ask
questions
he
did
ask
general
questions
i
dont
have
a
minutebyminute
account
of
the
conversation
q
how
long
a
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
it
was
about
minutes
q
telephone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
george
was
the
federal
cost
of
this
standoff
ever
a
consideration
in
terms
of
stepping
up
the
pressure
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
believe
so
no
q
george
you
keep
saying
that
the
president
takes
full
responsibility
but
then
you
refer
to
it
as
her
decision
does
the
president
not
accept
the
fact
that
as
commanderinchief
it
is
ultimately
his
decision
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
what
this
has
to
do
with
commanderinchief
this
was
a
law
enforcement
action
not
a
military
action
and
he
clearly
takes
responsibility
for
the
decisions
of
the
law
enforcement
agencies
involved
taken
in
his
government
i
mean
i
think
theres
just
no
ambiguity
about
that
q
but
is
he
accepting
it
as
his
decision
as
well
as
hers
or
is
he
saying
its
her
decision
theres
a
difference
mr
stephanopoulos
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
her
decision
he
did
not
object
to
that
decision
he
clearly
takes
full
responsibility
q
george
this
briefing
has
gone
on
just
a
little
over
minutes
and
as
you
can
see
a
lot
of
things
can
be
exchanged
what
exactly
did
they
spend
minutes
talking
about
if
it
was
just
very
general
thats
a
long
period
of
time
in
a
phone
conversation
mr
stephanopoulos
it
is
an
awful
long
phone
conversation
it
was
a
very
important
phone
conversation
i
think
brit
has
asked
that
we
take
the
question
and
ive
said
that
i
would
q
one
of
the
things
reno
said
last
night
is
that
the
buck
stops
here
i
think
that
was
her
direct
quotation
does
the
president
agree
with
that
in
this
case
mr
stephanopoulos
the
president
says
he
accepts
full
responsibility
i
think
what
the
attorney
general
was
saying
is
that
she
made
a
decision
that
shes
going
to
accept
all
the
responsibility
that
comes
to
her
and
shes
not
shrinking
from
that
at
all
but
neither
is
the
president
q
at
any
point
in
the
conversation
last
night
between
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
or
this
morning
did
she
ever
offer
her
a
resignation
mr
stephanopoulos
not
to
my
knowledge
q
even
before
the
fire
was
out
yesterday
there
were
some
republicans
on
capitol
hill
calling
for
an
investigation
is
the
white
house
at
all
concerned
about
the
timing
of
those
requests
trying
to
make
political
hay
out
of
this
situation
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
i
dont
want
to
cast
any
questions
about
the
motives
of
those
who
are
requesting
investigation
we
want
an
investigation
and
well
have
a
full
and
complete
investigation
q
in
what
forum
will
you
answer
brits
question
will
you
put
out
a
written
statement
will
you
the
wires
how
will
you
answer
the
question
that
youve
taken
mr
stephanopoulos
im
just
not
sure
q
george
can
you
remind
us
what
the
president
was
doing
all
yesterday
afternoon
where
he
was
and
what
meetings
he
was
involved
in
mr
stephanopoulos
ill
have
to
try
and
remember
he
had
a
series
of
meetings
with
different
members
of
the
staff
during
the
afternoon
he
was
certainly
monitoring
the
situation
in
waco
and
getting
periodic
reports
on
that
as
well
he
did
see
some
on
cnn
as
well
i
believe
he
saw
a
fair
amount
of
the
fbi
press
briefing
as
well
q
and
those
reports
would
have
come
to
him
from
mack
mclarty
would
they
do
you
think
mr
stephanopoulos
mack
talked
to
him
bruce
talked
to
him
i
talked
to
him
q
george
to
follow
helens
question
in
their
conversation
this
morning
did
they
discuss
at
all
her
statement
last
night
in
response
to
the
question
about
whether
she
would
resign
did
he
say
i
dont
know
why
you
felt
the
need
to
say
that
im
here
to
reassure
you
that
you
dont
have
to
do
this
did
that
come
up
at
all
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
it
even
came
up
that
specifically
i
know
that
the
bulk
of
the
conversation
was
discussing
where
do
we
go
from
here
and
what
form
the
investigation
q
the
didnt
talk
at
all
about
her
kind
of
remarkable
comment
last
night
about
mr
stephanopoulos
well
i
believe
she
was
asked
a
question
q
and
her
response
was
if
the
president
wants
me
to
i
will
mr
stephanopoulos
which
would
be
i
think
the
standard
response
that
most
cabinet
members
would
give
i
mean
its
a
conditional
statement
q
have
a
need
to
talk
about
whether
personally
about
whether
the
president
wanted
her
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
if
they
talked
about
it
i
mean
what
i
learned
about
the
conversation
was
that
it
was
largely
about
the
investigation
itself
and
this
just
didnt
come
up
i
did
not
ask
the
question
if
they
talked
about
q
will
you
take
that
with
the
brit
package
mr
stephanopoulos
certainly
laughter
q
george
for
the
record
does
the
president
want
her
to
resign
i
know
dee
dee
answered
this
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
absolutely
not
he
supports
janet
reno
shes
a
good
attorney
general
shes
done
a
good
job
she
handled
a
difficult
situation
extremely
well
q
george
does
the
president
feel
that
he
and
janet
reno
were
let
down
by
the
unanimous
professional
advice
from
the
law
enforcement
experts
on
the
ground
mr
stephanopoulos
no
and
the
president
is
not
secondguessing
that
decision
and
those
recommendations
in
any
way
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
doesnt
regret
the
loss
of
life
everybody
regrets
the
loss
of
life
in
this
situation
but
the
best
judgments
were
made
in
a
difficult
situation
based
on
the
best
information
we
had
q
george
the
conversation
was
the
one
on
sunday
is
that
correct
mr
stephanopoulos
yes
q
how
long
was
the
one
at
am
yesterday
morning
mr
stephanopoulos
i
dont
know
ill
take
that
question
too
q
were
these
outside
experts
that
they
were
consulting
with
or
experts
within
the
atf
and
the
fbi
mr
stephanopoulos
youd
have
to
ask
them
im
just
not
sure
i
know
that
there
were
several
experts
q
and
also
why
werent
there
replacements
for
these
people
is
the
unit
that
small
mr
stephanopoulos
again
i
think
it
is
a
very
small
highlyspecialized
unit
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
investigation
will
examine
q
george
isnt
there
a
factor
here
involving
the
fbi
director
normally
a
president
when
he
wants
to
get
information
doesnt
only
asks
the
attorney
general
i
know
the
chain
of
command
but
presidents
talk
to
their
fbi
directors
in
this
case
throughout
this
entire
siege
he
has
not
felt
that
he
could
pick
up
the
phone
and
talk
to
bill
sessions
who
is
from
waco
and
get
expertise
from
him
on
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
mr
stephanopoulos
i
think
he
talked
to
the
fbi
director
well
in
the
beginning
of
the
situation
when
it
first
broke
out
in
waco
at
the
same
time
the
attorney
general
bears
the
ultimate
responsibility
and
he
was
getting
fully
briefed
from
the
attorney
general
q
dont
you
think
the
ambiguous
situation
that
director
sessions
is
in
has
some
impact
on
the
way
the
president
is
briefed
and
on
the
way
that
all
of
this
evolved
mr
stephanopoulos
not
at
all
i
mean
its
perfectly
appropriate
that
he
be
briefed
by
the
attorney
general
and
that
the
attorney
general
has
supervisory
authority
over
the
fbi
director
and
thats
following
the
chain
of
command
the
press

even

new

theres

because

i

had

to
find
just
about

many

witnesses

which
is
why

what
about

parading

shows
proclaiming
their

bias
against

shouldnt
that
be
enough
for
a
judge
to
through
out
the

call

whatever

having

theres
some
reason
to

that
this

predated
the

opposed
to
being
a
product

that
gm
was
unfairly
prevented
from
discovering
it
by
venireman
concealment

otherwise
why
should
gm

demonstrate
for
such
ignorants
as
yourself
if
you
wish
the
legalization
of
drugs
will
provide
few
if
any
of
the
benefits
so
highly
taunted
by
its
proponents
safer
cheaper
drugs
along
with
revenues
from
taxes
on
those
drugs
reduced
crime
and
reduced
organized
crime
specifically
etc
etc
ahhh
the
classic
truth
by
blatant
assertion
technique
too
bad
its
so
demonstrably
false
take
a
look
at
great
britain
sometime
for
a
nice
history
on
drug
criminalization
the
evidence
there
shows
that
during
periods
of
time
when
drugs
such
as
heroin
were
illegal
crime
went
up
and
people
did
die
from
bad
drugs
during
times
when
drugs
were
legalized
those
trends
were
reversed
if
you
would
like
to
prove
how
clueless
you
are
we
can
get
into
why
again
a
lot
of
wasted
posts
that
i
dont
think
this
group
was
intended
for
and
something
easily
solved
by
you
doing
a
little
research
now
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
ironclad
proof
gosh
im
convinced
for
the
humor
impaired
first
assert
something
for
which
you
have
no
evidence
then
dodge
requests
for
proof
by
claiming
to
know
what
this
group
was
intended
for
as
to
research
if
youd
done
any
at
all
youd
realize
that
there
is
plenty
of
reason
to
believe
that
legalizing
drugs
will
have
many
benefits
to
society
there
are
some
plausible
arguments
against
it
too
but
they
arent
enough
to
convince
me
that
criminalization
of
drugs
is
the
answer
im
willing
to
be
convinced
im
wrong
but
i
seriously
doubt

the

are
in

fighting
any

there
is
also
worry
that
a
vat
would
be
far
too
easy
to
increase
incrementally
i
was
a
graduate
student
in
the
early
and
we
had
a
conference
on
reaganomics
where
jerry
jordan
then
a
member
of
the
council
of
economic
advisors
was
a
speaker
i
had
the
pleasure
of
driving
him
back
to
the
airport
afterwards
and
since
taxes
were
the
main
topic
of
discussion
i
thought
i
would
ask
him
about
the
vat
i
have
favored
it
for
these
reasons
you
mention
that
the
income
base
is
too
hazy
to
define
that
it
taxes
savings
and
investment
that
it
is
likely
to
be
more
visible
he
agreed
and
reported
that
the
cea
at
that
time
was
in
favor
of
vat
so
why
not
propose
it
i
asked
he
replied
that
the
reagan
white
house
feared
that
the
democrats
would
introduce
vat
in
addition
to
the
income
tax
rather
than
in
lieu
better
not
to
give
them
any
ideas
he
said
pretty
prescient

what
is
different

i

to
say
first
how
delighted
i
am
to
be
here
with
secretary
riley
and
with
senator
graham
the
three
of
us
served
as
governors
together
during
the
when
we
worked
constantly
on
strategies
to
improve
our
schools
when
we
led
often
difficult
and
long
efforts
to
upgrade
the
standards
in
american
education
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
instruction
our
children
were
receiving
there
were
no
two
governors
whom
i
admired
more
during
that
period
than
the
two
who
now
stand
on
this
stage
with
the
teacher
of
the
year
and
i
think
both
of
them
would
join
me
in
saying
that
after
all
the
testimony
has
been
heard
and
all
the
bills
have
been
passed
and
the
funds
have
been
raised
and
allocated
it
all
comes
down
to
what
happens
between
the
teacher
and
the
students
in

thats
why
todays

that
is

now

even
if

from

what

wrong
wrong

anything

if
nothing

touches

no

who
pushed

get

the
person
who
murdered
children
was
koresh
he
kept

brought

deliberately
you
may

a
not

thats
quite
true
i
dont

being

is
what
amateurs
try

you
are
talking
hard
decisions
such
as
whether
the
lives
of

should

risked
attempting
to
rescue
the

anyone
who
has
held
the
office
of
president
of
the

since
fdr
has
held
the
threat
that
if
the

or
its

were
to
be
threatened
then
the
usa
would
risk
nuclear
holocaust
in

beleive

not

is
not

that
nice

make

nutters
section
of

version
of

by
any

there
are
cases
where
society
has
to
be
protected
from
madmen
such
as
koresh
or
hitler
if
it
were
not
for
the
consideration
of
the
children
in
there
the
question
of
the
tactics
to
be
used
would
not
be
a
matter
of
anything
but
academic
significance
it
is
not
for
the
govt
to
prevent
people
from
commiting
mass
suicide
the
latest
reports
are
that
cult
members
were
shot
attempting
to
leave
the
compound
by
koresh
loyalists
during
the
fire
if
proven
that
would
entail
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
of
those
who
want
to
promote
koresh
as
some
sort
of
role
model
or
hero
i
need
hardly
add
that
it
is
koresh
that
has
created
the
holocaust
in
this
case
by
the
deliberate
arson
of
the
ranch
appocalypse
let
me
see
if
i
got
this
right
group
of
religious
plinter
schismatics
erect
a
compound
and
after
at
least
fifty
years
of
peaceful
coexistance
with
the
outside
community
having
shoot
outs
only
with
each
other
this
makes
them
dangerous
prior
history
would
seem
to
indicate
they
are
only
dangerous
to
themselves

was

how
about

i

this
requires
tolerance
for
those
that
go

but
we
all
know
people
who
have
no

skills
ith
the
death
of
the
children
everybody
is
getting
real
upset
what
about
the
other
plus
people
i
suppose
that
you
consider
children
to
be
property
of
the
state
with
the
family
as
custodians
in
the

its
the
other
way
around
children
are

property

the

to
reflect
the

of

congress
has
already
acted
to
revise
many
laws
to
reflect
the
fact
that
a
communist
soviet
union
has
been
replaced
by
a
democratic
russia
and
other
independent
states
however
many
laws
and
regulations
remain
that
contain
language
and
restrictions
that
fail
to
reflect
the
end
of
the
cold
war
and
that
unnecessarily
undermine
relations
with
russia
and
the
other
new
independent

the
president
today
has
ordered
an
executive
review
of
laws
and

that
where

such

can
be
revised

the

has
indicated
that
he
will
welcome
congressional
efforts
to
help
this

proceed
as
quickly
as
possible
this
review
will
weigh
all
considerations
that
pertain
to
revision
of
such
provisions
and
the
initiation
of
the
review
may
help
to
remedy
some
of
the
circumstances
that
have
justified
such
provisions
in
the
past
for
example
because
the
russians
are
eager
to
have
their
status
changed
under
the
jacksonvanik

president
yeltsin
personally
assured
president
clinton
in

that
he
would
look
into
individual
cases
involving
continuing
restrictions
on
emigration
from

by
addressing
such

aircraft
have
gattling
guns
used
to
shoot
down

a
gun
would
be
somewhere
in
the
cannon
realm
they
might
have
had
calibre
but
definitely
not
i
think
that
phil
needs
to
get
out
a
ruler
and
see
exactly
how
big
rounds
are
roughly
diameter
the
type
of
stuff
used
in
antiaircraft
gunnery
calibre
is
much
smaller
but
the
effective
range
sounds
about
right
maybe
he
just
got
the
two
confused
the

reasoning
was
sound
but
the
note

you
can
judge
the

on

from
the
fact
that
congressperson
pat
scroder
is
a
supporter
of
the
fbis
actions
she
was
on
television
this
week
saying
that
the
cost
of
the
operation
in
waco
was
a
valid
reason
for
the
storming
and
gassing
of
the
compound
subject
the
government
is
lying
yesterday
the
fbi
was
saying
that
at
least
three
of
the
bodies
had
gunshot
wounds
indicating
that
they
were
shot
trying
to
escape
the
fire
todays
paper
quotes
the
medical
examiner
as
saying
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
gunshot
wounds
in
any
of
the
recovered
bodies
at
the
beginning
of
this
siege
it
was
reported
that
while
koresh
had
a
class
iii
machine
gun
license
todays
paper
quotes
the
government
as
saying
no
they
didnt
have
a
license
todays
paper
reports
that
a
number
of
the
bodies
were
found
with
shoulder
weapons
next
to
them
as
if
they
had
been
using
them
while
dying
which
doesnt
sound
like
the
sort
of
action
i
would
expect
from
a
suicide
our
government
lies
as
it
tries
to
cover
over
its
incompetence
and
negligence
why
should
i
believe
the
fbis
claims
about
anything
else
when
we
can
see
that
they
are
lying
this

the
reason
that
the

is
that
they

you

thank

hoped

that
has

on

im
also
not
going

prolong
the
debate
on
this
i
wanted
to
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
points
you
make
but
this
will
be
my
last
posting
on
this
no
dont
stop
right
to
equal
opportunity
lets
call
it
reo
involves
coercion
in
all
cases
by
definition
one
question
is
it
your
position
that
there
is
no
reo
or
just
that
this
is
a
lesser
right
to
foa
good
question
it
just
depends
hows
that
for
an
answer
seriously
i
believe
that
it
depends
on
wether
or
not
you
are
talking
about
a
governmental
employer
or
not
in
this
case
i
believe
that
there
should
be
absolutely
no
discrimination
direct
or
indirect
period
i
feel
this
way
not
because
it
would
offend
my
moral
sensibilities
which
it
of
course
would
but
because
the
government
is
a
coercive
entity
which
we
cannot
escape
it
boggles
my
mind
that
in
my
lifetime
there
were
whites
only
drinking
fountains
in
some
parks
but
no
fountains
for
others
yet
the
taxes
garnished
to
support
those
fountains
certainly
were
not
applied
to
whites
only
in
essence
we
cannot
escape
the
coercive
state
even
randy
weavers
have
to
pay
property
tax
on
the
other
hand
private
employers
are
not
a
monopoly
and
their
businesses
should
be
run
by
them
and
not
by
the
government
unless
they
elect
to
turn
their
affairs
over
to
that
government
why
says
who
why
can
mom
pop
have
foa
but
ibm
be
forced
and
force
is
the
correct
word
here
to
have
reo
in
the
case
of
the
mom
pop
store
their
foa
is
directly
affected
they
as
individuals
will
have
to
associate
with
whomever
they
hire
in
the
case
of
ibm
i
ask
again
whose
foa
are
we
protecting
i
do
not
accept
that
ibm
as
a
corporate
entity
has
a
right
to
foa
but
if
the
mom
pop
store
is
affected
by
who
they
hire
isnt
ibm
there
is
a
slippery
slope
here
in
santa
cruz
where
a
number
of
loony
antidiscrimination
laws
exist
a
guy
sued
a
restaurant
for
not
hiring
him
because
he
had
every
imaginable
kitchen
utensil
dangling
from
his
earlobe
and
his
tatoos
were
very
distracting
suddenly
by
arm
waving
by
magic
a
landlord
does
not
have
foa
and
on
what
basis
does
the
foa
of
the
landlord
disappear
it
seems
that
vague
terms
like
no
contact
with
tenants
suffice
on
the
basis
that
the
landlord
has
no
contact
with
hisher
tenants
if
the
landlord
doesnt
associate
with
his
tenants
then
how
can
he
complain
that
his
foa
is
being
violated
i
have
a
lot
of
interaction
all
positive
with
my
tenants
so
i
guess
that
that
isnt
an
issue
but
say
i
were
to
buy
a
unit
in
another
town
and
have
it
managed
by
a
third
party
lets
say
that
i
have
a
real
aversion
to
christians
because
of
the
stuff
that
they
buy
into
hook
line
and
sinker
and
because
of
the
lunatic
schmucks
that
they
try
to
get
elected
i
dont
want
any
of
those
fish
symbols
hanging
in
the
window
of
a
house
that
i
own
should
the
government
intervene
if
i
was
elie
weizel
and
the
only
rental
applicant
was
tom
metzger
should
i
be
forced
to
rent
this
distant

to
him
the

are

owned
they
can
give
you
a
list
of
all

they
have
no
anonymous

owners
publicly
owned
in
the
sense
that
their
stock
is
publicly
traded
and
that
the
shares
of
stock
are
owned
by
a
generic
and
everchanging
public
yes
and
the
neat
thing
about
this
is
that
unlike
the

you
and
i
can
buy

in

i
wouldnt
march
in

with
a
group
like
that
either
and
if
youre
talking
about
nambla
i
think
youll
find
that
they
do
not
advocate
child
molestation
i
also
think
youll
find
that
the
vast
majority
of
homosexuals
they
advocate
sex
between
adults
and
children
with
no
lower
limit
on
age
but
thats
right
homosexuals
dont
believe
that
an
adult
sodomizing
a
five
year
old
is
child
molestation
will
have
no
truck
with
that
group
anyway
fooled

they
march
in

sure
whatever
consenting

want
to
do
in

is
none

you
are
the
ones
that
want
more
laws
telling
me
what
to
do
in
private
quit
lumping
me
in
with
groups
the
fact
is
that
homophobia
is
an
evil
unjustified
prejudice
just
like
racism
or
sexism
you
cant
reject
all
but
one
of
those
drewcifer
it
is
nothing
like
racism
or

you
choose

my

is
because

sigh
youre
absolutely
right
we
have
no
political
power
whatsoever
if
only
that
were
true
in
california
homosexuals
have
enough
power
to
impose
their
morals
on
others
the
only
moral
were
imposing
is
one
which
you
supposedly
embrace
already
every
human
beings
right
to
be
treated
as
such
i
dont
expect
to
be
hired
based
on
my
sexual
orientation
if
someone
decides
he
wants
a
gayonly
staff
of
employees
thats
his
business
i
wont
force
him
to
hire
heterosexuals
please
dont
force
me
to
hire
homosexuals
therefore
we
should
be
oppressed
and
ignored
and
denigrated
right
i
you
arent
oppressed
in
california
but
its
ok
to
oppress
us
thats
what
youre
saying
no
im
saying
its
none
of
the
governments
business
what
two
consenting
adults
do
in
private
you
dont
believe
that
unfortunately
certainly
hope
you
dont
have
an
so

because
if
she
heard
how
disparaging
you
are
towards
political
minorities
and
if
she
had
any
shred
of
selfrespect
shed
be
out
the
door
why
do
you
keep
insulting
women
and
blacks
by
comparing
them
to
homosexuals
this
sort
of
crap
makes
me
so
fucking
sick
that
i
cant
even
bring
myself
to
touch
it
youre
a
fuckwit
with
no
perspective
no
valid
life
experience
and
no
true
knowledge
of
the
human
condition
i
see
no
point
in
trying
to
convince
you
politely
that
were
not
all
like
the
ones
youve
met
because
youre
showing
no
willingness
at
all
to
be
openminded
enough
to
accept
that
your
stupid
generalizations
have
exceptions
you
are
an
intellectual
waste
and
the
reason
you
believe
the
worst
of
homosexuals
is
that
you
bring
out
the
worst
in
them
bi

are

if

all

she

janet

the

were
nothing

pawns
in

game
he
was
a
madman
who
was
going
to
hurt
the
children
and
everyone
else
in
the
compound
no
matter
what
the
fbi
did
the
situation
in
waco
was
similar
to
a
hostage
situation
with
a
madman
holding
a
gun
against
the
head
of
an
innocent
person
in
such
a
situation
a
person
who
provokes
the
madman
and
causes
him
to
pull
the
guns
trigger
is
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
hostage
janet
reno
blindly
stumbled
in
there
and
basically
threw
a
tear
gas
container
at
the
madman
hoping
that
he
would
release
the
hostage
its
no
surprise
that
the
madman
would
pull
the
trigger
in
response
to
that
kind
of
provocation
such
a
hostage
situation
has
taken
place
on
numerous
occasions
with
the
result
of
the
police
trying
to
take
the
place
by
force
and
the
result
being
the
death
of
the
hostages
and
the
gunmen
however
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
the
blame
landing
squarely
on
the
police
in
this
country
we
have
a
policy
of
not
negotiating
a
back
down
from
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
since
that
only
encourages
other
terrorists
and
hostage
takers
