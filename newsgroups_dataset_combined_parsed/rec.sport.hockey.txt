i
wrote
when
the
pens
got
mario
granted
there
was
big
publicity
etc
etc
and
interest
was
immediately
generated
gretzky
did
the
same
thing
for
la
however
imnsho
neither
team
would
have
seen
a
marked
improvement
in
attendance
if
the
team
record
did
not
improve
in
the
year
before
lemieux
came
pittsburgh
finished
with
points
following
his
arrival
the
pens
finished
with
and
points
with
a
couple
of
stanley
cups
thrown
in
it
was
at
this
point
the
pens
attendance
was
near
capacity
out
of
sellouts
yet
they
hadnt
made
the
playoffs
since
how
do
you
explain
a
place
team
breaking
attendance
records
when
they
havent
been
to
the
playoffs
in
years
mario
lemieux
is
the
explanation
imho
you
could
make
a
case
that
the
expectation
of
an
improving
team
that
would
make
the
playoffs
is
the
reason
funny
you
should
mention
itthis
is
exactly
the
case
i
was
going
to
make
but
i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had
a
point
season
and
was
the
first
nongretzky
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
since
people
turned
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fans
even
if
the
team
sucks
but
this
is
short
term
only
i
still
do
not
think
the
attendance
increase
will
last
unless
the
team
is
a
winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one
pittsburgh
was
still
getting
better
so
people
continued
to
support
them
if
they
suddenly
dropped
to
say
points
youd
have
knee
surgery
for
some
of
the
people
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
also
the
following
year
the
pens
had
points
not
ok
my
numbers
came
from
the
nhl
guide
and
record
book
they
made
the
transaction
to
try
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improvement
in
attendance
came
before
they
started
doing
this
coffey
late
in
and
before
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubling
of
attendance
occured
in
from
the
previous
year
an
increase
from
points
to
points
is
not
going
to
do
that
the
arrival
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
you
can
give
the
credit
to
mario
since
he
deserves
it
but
my
point
is
that
it
wasnt
mario
himself
but
it
was
the
expectation
of
things
to
come
ie
a
winning
team
that
he
created
by
being
the
next
great
hockey
superstar
and
before
anybody
jumps
in
and
says
im
nitpicking
and
mincing
words
go
back
and
read
from
where
this
thread
started
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fans
mind
who
suddenly
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pens
was
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amazing
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
was
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
ass
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
was
the
latter
similar
thing
happened
in
la
before
gretzkys
arrival
about
per
game
after
constant
sellouts
they
are
still
selling
out
every
game
despite
showing
little
or
no
improvement
since
gretzkys
first
year
there
how
do
you
explain
it
people
are
going
to
see
gretzky
they
certainly
arent
going
to
see
a
winner
they
havent
got
a
winner
theyve
had
much
better
teams
in
their
past
history
than
they
currently
have
yet
they
didnt
draw
as
well
then
i
dont
think
this
is
accurate
the
tickets
sell
but
people
dont
go
to
the
games
i
think
this
thread
has
already
been
discussedseason
ticket
holders
in
la
dont
always
use
their
tickets
so
in
effect
after
the
kings
initial
success
following
gretzkys
arrival
to
points
same
source
and
corresponding
attendance
jump
there
has
been
an
effective
drop
in
attendance
even
though
ticket
sales
may
not
have
changed
much
whether
or
not
the
kings
are
a
winner
is
debatable
i
claim
that
since
gretzkys
arrival
they
have
at
the
very
least
been
competitivei
also
claim
that
mcnall
has
made
a
stupid
move
in
trying
to
reassemble
the
oiler
dynastybut
thats
another
story
and
included
only
because
i
dont
like
mcnall
anyway
mcnall
did
do
some
heavy
marketing
around
gretzky
and
that
undoubtedly
was
also
responsible
for
the
attendance
and
merchandising
sales
etc
but
as
i
said
when
the
kings
have
been
in
there
little
tailspins
over
the
past
couple
of
years
there
have
been
empty
seats
at
the
forum
even
if
the
tickets
were
sold
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
lemieux
or
gretzky
the
player
can
transcend
winning
as
the
major
drawing
power
for
the
short
term
imo
although
i
think
that
its
inevitable
that
the
team
will
improve
with
a
player
such
as
lemieux
or
gretzky
simply
because
they
make
people
around
them
better
but
winning
sure
as
hell
helps
well
at
least
we
are
in
full
agreement
here
this
does
not
make
rogers
point
any
more
valid
but
the
jets
arent
so
are
you
saying
roger
has
ever
had
a
valid
point
couldnt
resist
getting
a
huge
jump
in
productivity
yet
they
are
getting
a
huge
jump
in
attendance
this
is
due
to
the
emergence
of
teemu
selanne
they
have
the
best
record
in
hockey
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
because
they
are
winning
yes
but
they
are
doing
no
worse
than
last
year
i
think
the
same
type
of
reasoning
i
applied
to
a
new
pittsburgh
fan
applies
to
all
the
extra
people
showing
up
at
winnipeg
games
its
difficult
to
predict
but
do
you
think
that
if
the
jets
miss
the
playoffs
next
season
that
in
the
year
after
they
will
maintain
their
attendance
levels
i
seriously
doubt
it
because
in
that
case
the
expectation
of
an
improving
team
would
be
gone
with
or
without
selanne
i
did
provide
the
example
of
rocket
ismail
and
the
toronto
argonauts
of
the
cfldid
you
leave
it
out
because
you
dont
know
much
about
the
cfl
if
thats
the
case
then
fair
enough
but
if
it
isnt
the
case
then
im
curious
to
hear
your
explanation
subject

writes
the
jets
use
the
breakaway
pass
scheme
to
create
a
scoring
sensation
in
order
to
generate
interest
if
teams
score
as
many
or
more
goals
against
winnipeg
when
selanne
is
on
the
ice
as
winnipeg
scores
when
he
is
on
the
ice
then
i
cant
see
how
his
contribution
can
be
described
as
impressive
implicitly
you
are
assuming
that
goals
scored
against
winnipeg
with
selanne
on
the
ice
can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a
forward
winnipeg
has
a
lousy
defensive
record
anyway
lets
put
it
another
way
john
cullens
is
terrible
whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
feed
selanne
it
is
to
win
and
feeding
selanne
does
not
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
winning
knowledgeable
hockey
observers
the
world
over
would
agree
that
feeding
selanne
so
he
can
score
does
contribute
in
a
meaningful
way
to
winning
pat
burns
wouldnt
have
a
goal
suck
like
this
on
his
team
youre
worried
about
teemu
when
you
have
glenn
anderson
on
your
team
we
dont
know
what
selanne
does
best
we
do
know
what
jets
management
wants
and
again
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
allow
selanne
to
do
what
he
does
best
it
is
to
win
hockey
games
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
nope
didnt
see
it
i
was
too
busy
watching
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
his
goal
subject
re
this
years
biggest
and
worst
opinion
i
can
only
comment
on
the
kings
but
the
most
obvious
candidate
for
pleasant
surprise
is
alex
zhitnik
he
came
highly
touted
as
a
defensive
defenseman
but
hes
clearly
much
more
than
that
great
skater
and
hard
shot
though
wish
he
were
more
accurate
in
fact
he
pretty
much
allowed
the
kings
to
trade
away
that
huge
defensive
liability
paul
coffey
kelly
hrudey
is
only
the
biggest
disappointment
if
you
thought
he
was
any
good
to
begin
with
but
at
best
hes
only
a
mediocre
goaltender
a
better
choice
would
be
tomas
sandstrom
though
not
through
any
fault
of
his
own
but
because
some
thugs
in
toronto
decided
to
threaten
his
career
in
order
to
avoid
conceding
a
goal
other
than
that
the
award
goes
to
robert
lang
an
uninspiring
czech
robitaille
could
easily
be
mvp
but
id
prefer
to
give
it
to
rob
blake
who
is
quietly
becoming
one
of
the
leagues
premier
defensemen
and
if
the
kings
manage
to
hold
onto
him
and
the
rest
of
our
young
defense
it
could

leafs
game
vs
the

was
a

let
me
tell
you
it
was
a
well
played
game
by
both
teams
i
thought

according
to
the
don
and
ron
it
was
the
an
offnight
for
the
leafs
and
the
devils
were
outplaying
toronto
well
i
beg
to
differ
imho
clark
deserved
to
be
a
first
star
as
much
as
gilmour
did
his
fast
breaks
towards
the
net
and
the
good
opportunites
that
he
created
reminded
me
of
the
clark
of
old
but
not
to
take
any
of
the
credit
away
from
gilmour
i
think
the
leafs
are
playing
great
hockey
why
well
first
look
at
their
injury
list
which
includes
cullen
ellet
zezel
macoun
of

my
question
is
thishow
will
the
leafs
fare
when
they
are
once
again
healthy
if
they
are
playing
this
well
so
far
second
just
look
at
their

still

in

moved

overall
to

as

we

that
the

has

it

be
a
very
close
race
between
chicago
and

and
the

of

will
probably
be
their

the

inherent

expansion
of
one
team
in
the

one

says
the
precedent
was
set
by
the
wha
in
their

season
they
used
a
red
puck
for
exhibition
games
and
a
blue
one
for
the
regular
season
thankfully
they
abandoned
it
in
favour
of
black
before
the
next
season
began
one
reason
that
the
wha
abandoned
the
blue
puck
was
the
fact
that
it
crumbled
very
quickly
during
play
the
blue
dye
that
was
used
somehow
affected
the
vulcanized
rubber
of
the

decreasing
its

hi
according
to
my
always
questionable
newspaper
theres
a
silver
dollar
being
minted
in
canada
the
back
of
which
commemorates
the
anniversary
of
the
stanley
cup
now
i
know
full
well
what
coins
are
used
every
day
in
canada
i
can
easily
fish
a
few
out
of
my
pocket
change
right
now
in
fact
my
question
is
since
the
loon
is
the
only
dollar
coin
that
i
know
is
legal
tender
is
this
just
a
commemorative
coin
with
no
monetary
exchange
value
or
what
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
only
hockey
buffs
and
coin
collectors
might
covet
with
no
chance
of
it
being
circulated
if
it
is
an
uncirculated
coin
whats
the
current
cost
and
whats
its
potential
value
just
curious
if
no
one
knows
ill
take
this
to
socculturecanada
and
reccollecting
or
whatever
it
is
thanks

i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had

season
and
was
the
first
nongretzky
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
since
people
turned
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fans
even
if
the
team
sucks
but
this
is
short
term
only
i
still
do
not
think
the
attendance
increase
will

pittsburgh

still

continued

if
they
suddenly
dropped
to

youd
have
knee
surgery
for
some
of
the
people
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
i
disagree
mcnall
has
demonstrated
with
gretzky
that
a
star
brings
out
the
crowds
whether
or
not
the
team
is
expected
to
do
well
very
few
fans
real
istically
expect
the
kings
to
do
well
this
year
although
i
do
and
yet
they
still
go
out
to
see
gretzky
this
is
the
marketing
strategy
selling
the
game
by
selling
the
stars
that
is
employed
by
baseball
and
notably
the
nba
and
this
is
the
attitude
that
the
new
bettmanmcnall
leadership
is
bringing
to
the
league
they
have
gone
on
record
as
stating
that
they
are
trying
to
sell
the
game
on
its
stars
timo
salami
and
brett
hull
are
perfect
examples
of
players
that
real
fans
know
arent
worth
a
damn
and
yet
being
benificiaries
of
marketingoriented
coaching
strategies
have
goal
totals
that
would
indicate
to
the
casual
observer
the
very
fans
the
nhl
wants
to
attract
that
these
players
are
indeed
superstars
they
made
the
transaction
to
try
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improvement
in
attendance
came
before
they
started
doing
this
coffey
late
in
and
before
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubling
of
attendance
occured
in
from
the
previous
year
an
increase
from
points
to
points
is
not
going
to
do
that
the
arrival
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fans
mind
who
suddenly
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pens
was
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amazing
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
was
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
ass
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
was
the
latter
it
aint
nearly
so
simple
as
this
the
casual
fan
doesnt
think
about
much
at
all
can
you
actually
find

adult

believes
that
mcdonalds

i
did

you
leave
it
out
because
you
dont
know
much
about
the
cfl
if
thats
the
case
then
fair
enough
but
if
it
isnt
the
case
then
im
curious
to
hear
your
explanation
yes
but
apparently
the
rocket
has
not
lived
up
to
his
marketing
responsi
bilities
has
he
he
was
hyped
initially
as
a
superstar
but
outside
of

grey
cup
game
he
has
done
very
little
to

that

implicitly
you

goals
scored

with

on

ice
can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a
forward
winnipeg
has
a
lousy
defensive
record
anyway
lets
put
it
another
way
john
cullens
is
terrible
whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
are
you
comparing
cullen
to
salami
i
would
say
that
that
is
valid
if
winnipeg
is
such
a
lousy
defensive
team
then
why
the
hell
does
salami
stand
around
the
other
teams
blueline
when
the
puck
is
in
his
own
end
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
feed
selanne
it
is
to
win
and
feeding
selanne
does
not
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
winning
knowledgeable
hockey
observers
the
world
over
would
agree
that
feeding
selanne
so
he
can
score
does
contribute
in
a
meaningful
way
to
winning
excuse
me
are
the
jets
playing
hockey
let
me
checkyes
but
just
barely
they
have
allowed
more
goals
than
they
have
scored
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
salamis
to
me
sounds
like
they
would
be
just
as
well
off
or
better
if
he
played
the
solid
twoway
game
that
our
friends
in
finland
claim
he
is
capable
of
but
if
he
did
that
he
wouldnt
be
chal
lenging
for
the
league
lead
in
goals
would
he
the
biplanes
might
be
challenging
for

however
youre
worried
about
teemu
when
you
have
glenn
anderson
on
your
team
now
lets
seeyou
have
compared
timo
to
anderson
and
cullen
whos
next
mike
foligno
we
dont
know
what
selanne
does
best
we
do
know
what
jets
management
wants
and
again
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
allow
selanne
to
do
what
he
does
best
it
is
to
win
hockey
games
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
some
of
our
finnish
friends
who
have
watched
him
play
claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
style
of
contribution
would
be
more
conducive
to
winning
or
dont
you
think
so
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
nope
didnt
see
it
i
was
too
busy
watching
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
his
goal
i
dont
believe
it
you
did
compare
him
to
foligno
and
i
honestly
hadnt
read
this
far
it
would
help
if
you
used
a
little
discrimination
in
your
thinking
your
contributions
would
be
more
highly
valued
if
we
could
see
that
you
werent
trying
to
be
merely
argumentative

when
talking
about

broadcasters
lets
give
a
moment
of
silence
to
remember
the
st
louis
blues
great
dan
kelly
many
of
you
may
have
heard
him
in
the
late
and
early
on
cbs
he
used
to
do
hockey
night
in
canada
intermissions
with
another
recently
deceased
great
danny
gallivan
of
the
canadiens
agreed
hereill
never
forget
dan
kelly
calling
the
playbyplay
in
the
canada
cup
he
was
masterful
and
danny
gallivan
will
never
be
replaced
even
now
when
i
watch
hnic
i
remember
his
voicewhen
i
see
an
al

hey
whats
with
these
guys
named
al
who
can
shoot
shot
from
the
point
i
still
think
blistering
blastthn
had
a
tribute
to
gallivan
in
the
issue
following
his
death
in
the
story
they
included
a
quote
from
one
of
the
games
he
did
it
went
it
appears
risebrough
has
pugnaciously
construed
that
check
he
said
and
will
undoubtedly
make
a
visitation
to
the
box
of

gallivan
hes
sorely
missed

heres

best
there

subject
this

biggest

i
was
thinking
about
who
on
each
of
the
teams
were
the
mvps
biggest
surprises
and
biggest
disappointments
this
year
now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
teams
the
same
amount
anyway
mvp
most
valuable
player
to
his
team
both
in
terms
of
points
and
in
terms
of
leadership
cant
win
without
him
biggest
surprise
the
player
who
rose
above
expectation
the
player
that
may
have
raised
the
level
of
his
game
to
a
new
height
even
if
that
new
level
doesnt
necessarily
warrant
an
allstar
berth
includes
those
players
who
at
the
outset
of
the
season
may
not
even
have
been
in
the
teams
plans
biggest
disappointment
the
player
from
whom
we
expected
more
eg
i
picked
denis
savard
in
montreal

with
the

okay
you
hockey
playing
fansfinatics
out
there
im
looking
over
the
wide
range
of
aluminum
sticks
for
the
first
time
ive
been
playing
with
pieces
of
lumbar
that
seem
to
weigh
alot
and
break
after
a
few
uses
so
im
thinking
of
changing
to
an
aluminum
shaft
so
when
i
break
the
blade
all
i
have
to
do
is
change
it
the
problem
is
that
there
is
such
a
wide
reange
of
models
and
selections
out
there
that
im
not
certain
which
to
consider
can
any
of
you
post
some
of
your
suggestions
and
experiences
with
the
aluminum
sticks
what
is
the
difference
between
models
what
do
you
likedislike
about
them
and
which
brands
are
best
ive
had
and
still
have
a
few
aluminum
sticks
i
got
my
first
when
i
was
a
christian
and
broke
the
shaft
halfway
through
the
season
two
years
later
i
bought
another
a
canadian
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
season
and
i
still
have
it
i
also
have
an
easton
that
a
friend
was
getting
rid
off
after
giving
up
the
game
i
find
that
easton
blades
are
easier
to
get
but
all
brands
of
blades
are
pretty
well
interchangeable
watch
out
for
dried
up
bits
of
firewood
that
some
stores
pass
off
as
blades
in
my
experiences
the
blades
of
an
aluminum
break
more
often
than
regular
sticks
but
ive
only
ever
broken
one
aluminum
shaft
i
like
aluminum
sticks
the
blades
are
quickly
changed
even
on
the
bench
if
you
have
to
on
the
downside
the
shaft
wont
break
if
you
decide
to
impale
yourself
on
it

well
since
the
oilers
didnt
win
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
games
im
not
sure
they
deserve
and
mvp
cant
win
without
him
however
id
suggest
kelly
buchberger
instead
of
dave
manson
who
has
had
a
brutal
year
his
pick
for
the
allstar
game
notwithstanding
as
for
biggest
surprise
id
say
that
buchberger
had
higher
expectations
this
year
due
to
his
breakthrough
year
for
him
last
year
so
he
didnt
really
raise
his
game
my
suggestion
would
be
shjon
podein
one
of
the
callups
from
cape
breton
during
the
year
he
was
quite
far
down
on
the
depth
chart
in
the
oilers
stable
of
prospects
but
made
a
big
impact
on
the
team
he
has
goals
in
his
games
and
is
only
those
are
decent
numbers
for
a
thirdline
player
who
was
seemingly
doomed
to
minorleague
oblivion
the
oilers
coaching
staff
likens
his
style
to
john
tonelli
i
think
hell
be
on
the
fulltime
roster
next
year
as
for
biggest
disappointment
you
could
name
any
of
the
players
the
oilers
dumped
for
lousy
production
this

nicholls
gilchrist
tikkanen

even

i

hockey
week
on
tsn
yesterday
and
they
had
a
feature
on
this
guy
that
does
a
lot
most
of
the
masks
for
nhl
goalies
they
talked
about
how
they
are
made
what
they
are
made
of
and
the
designs
that
are
put
on
them
etc
actually
this
part
was
really
interesting
it
turns
out
that
the
mask
is
customfit
to
the
goalies
face
the
goalie
puts
hisher
face
through
a
piece
of
wood
or
was
it
plastic
with
a
hole
in
it
that
allows
only
the
face
and
forehead
to
show
hair
is
covered
by
a
cap
eyes
are
covered
by
a
plastic
wraptype
material
and
vaseline
is
put
on
the
goaltenders
face
then
a
plaster
is
spread
on
their
cheeks
forehead
and
chin
which
takes
about
minutes
to
dry
sufficiently
when
it
dries
it
is
effectively
a
mold
of
the
goalies
face
this
is
used
as
the
basis
of
the
mask
the
rest
involves
padding
the
inside
hardening
the
exterior
fitting
the
cage
etc
etc
john
blue
of
the
bruins
actually
demonstrated
the
procedure
on
the
show
he
exhibited
a
couple
masks
he
is
currently
working
on
namely
a
new
mask
for
andy
moog
which
is
a
basic
reworking
of
his
current
mask
with
the
bear
on
it
and
new
mask
for
bob
essensa
which
was
really
cool
the
jets
logo
was
on
the
chin
and
there
were
two
fighter
jets
on
either
side
on
the
forehead
with
an
airbrushed
background
yeah
essensas
mask
looked
really
good
the
best
one
of
all
was
one
he
never
talked
about
he
just
held
it
up
it
has
the
current
leafs
crest
on
the
chin
and
an
awesome
looking
black
panther
on
the
forehead
it
has
to
be
a
new
mask
for
felix
potvin
but
he
never
said
whose
it
was
actually
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
it
was
potvins
for
certain
i
would
bet
money
on
it
either
wayand
it
did
look
awesome

hes

he

many

in

ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on

teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is

every

i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the

instead
gives

this

until

to
fight
harder
to
get

the

the
number
of
europeans
in
the

was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the

canadians
americans
europeans

the

there
are

i
am
sick
you
know
youre

right
i

we
should
round
up
all
those
players
of

not

okay
the

remark
was
a

carried

but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play

and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their

with
the

the

yes
there

are

look

i
loved
dan
kelly
he
was
on
usa
when
i
first
got
hooked
on
hockey
back
in
or
so
no
he
wasnt
always
spot
on

of
the
play
and
he
wasnt
overly
cute

those
pipes
that
lusty
barrel

no

was

some
fellas
we

i
rode
into

mania
on
the
coattails
of
gretzky
and
the
boys
on
the
bus
my
first
finals
saw
the
islanders
sweep
them
but
ill
never
forget
the
night
a
year
later
when
the
oilers
closed
it
out
at
home
in
the
pandemonium
the
smoke
from
a
million
sparklers
the
long
emptynet
goal
near
the

letting

tell

for

long
seconds
then
that
voice
barking
through
the
din
dave
lumley
sews
it
up

it
sounds
stupid

that
early
for
me
hockey
memory
will
always
bring
a
thrill
since
then
ive
grown
a

more
jaded
about
the

i
was

by

and
the

winner
will

it

be
a

easier
to
build

against

like
the

whoever
plays
the
kings
in

will

much

i

winner
vancouver
canucks
ill
have

on
this
one
i
think
vancouver
will
go
as
bure
goes
and
if
he
continues
on
his
goal
scoring
slump
then
they
wont
even
make
it
out
of
the

i
think
the

will
make

the
first

regardless
of
who
they
play
they
seem
to
be
doing
pretty
well
even
with
that
bad
game
against
minnesota
on
saturday
i
think
itll
be
either
calgary
or
los

to
win
the
smythe
ie
go
on
to
the
conference
finals
wales
conference
trophy
islanders
and
bruins
will
fight
to

i
think
the

have
enough
steam

overtake
the
bruins
in
seven
campbell
conference
trophy
a
walk
for
vancouver
maybe
in
or
but
definately
not
stanley
cup
final
islanders
and
vancouver
islanders
will
have
nothing
left
by
this
point
and
will
succumb
fairly
easily
to
the
canucks
stanley
cup
champion
vancouver
canucks
still
have

i

ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
thats
why
we
have
expansion
to
create
more
jobs
nhl
teams
cant
afford
to
import
role
players
from
europe
they
pick
the
stars
but
will
continue
to
build
their
teams
around
local
players
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
id
love
to
see
a
european
nhl
division
but
cant
see
it
happen
for
some
time
theres
simply
not
enough
fan
interest
at
the
moment
in
several
crucial
markets
like
germany
italy
and
france
while
sweden
and
finland
probably
cant
afford
to
shell
out
for
tickets
the
way
americancanadian
fans
do
call
it
the
minnesota
north
stars
effect
scandinavians
do
love
hockey
but
we
prefer
to
watch
local
inexpensive
hockey
to
the
nhl
the
national
hockey
league
should
love
the
idea
though
paneuropean
tv
channels
such
as
eurosport
could
bring
in
the
millions
the
american
networks
likely
never
will
pay
i
just

absolutely
shutouts

runnerups
to

best
but
galley
thinks
hes
paul

puts

fedyk

eklund
was
a
big

mark
this

was
coming
off
injuries
points

is
not

at

and
recently
hes
been

in

theyve
gotten
eklund
has
never
had
a

a

season
in
his
career
his
production
is
very
typical
for
him
how
does
he
qualify
as
a
disappointment
if
anything
hes
a
surprise
my
choice
would
be
roussel
if
i
went
strictly
by
what
was
expected
of
players
but
i
never
thought
that
he
had
what
it
takes
to
be
a
goalie
my
biggest
disappointment
is
bill
dineen
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
the
perfect
coach
for
this
young
team
instead
hes
made
too
many
bad
moves
and
imho
has
cost
them
enough
games
to
keep
them
out
of
the
playoffs
this
year
any
coach
that
thinks
putting
eric
lindros
at

on

tommy

he
barely

summary
if
the

played
like
this
every
night
theyd
be
in
the
playoffs
this
year
the
flyers
hit
everything
that
moved
they
created
scoring
chance
after
scoring
chance
they
snuffed
out
everything
that
the
leafs
tried
to
do
jason
bowen
made
a
good
play
on
his
first
nhl
shift
that
almost
created
a
goal
he
had
the
puck
in
the
top
of
the
left
offensive
circle
all
alone
but
instead
of
taking
the
shot
he
found
brindamour
crashing
the
net
on
the
other
side
a
perfect
pass
and
a
good
shot
across
daren
puppas
body
should
have
been
a
goal
but
puppa
made
a
great
save
reading
the
play
garry
galley
gave
the
maple
leafs
ranked
power
play
the
first
chance
when
he
hooked
doug
gilmour
at
the
flyers
lowly
ranked
penalty
killing
unit
was
almost
flawless
the
entire
game
and
set
the
tone
on
this
kill
the
maple
leafs
got
almost
nothing
but
long
unscreened
shots
and
the
defense
swept
away
every
rebound
after
the
power
play
the
flyers
got
a
goal
on
an
ugly
play
rod
brindamour
gave
the
puck
to
greg
hawgood
at
the
right
point
and
he
sent
a
drive
at
the
net
puppa
made
the
save
and
kicked
the
rebound
right
into
the
feet
of
josef
beranek
and
bob
rouse
who
were
wrestling
in
the
slot
beranek
was
able
to
get
his
stick
on
the
puck
and
push
it
out
to
dineen
who
was
skating
into
the
slot
from
the
right
circle
and
he
lifted
a
backhander
over
puppa
for
a
flyers
lead
at
the
flyers
kept
the
pressure
on
and
puppa
was
the
only
leaf
keeping
the
flyers
from
building
on
their
lead
for
a
while
eventually
things
settled
down
and
defense
prevailed
each
team
got
an
occasional
scoring
chance
but
the
goalies
were
strong
bowen
started
giving
some
lindroslike
checks
in
his
own
corners
then
lindros
who
was
looking
to
avenge
a
hit
foligno
gave
him
thought
he
had
a
chance
to
even
the
score
he
had
foligno
lined
up
at
center
ice
leaned
into
him
and
rode
him
into
the
center
ice
boards
the
only
problem
was
that
foligno
was
a
little
far
from
the
boards
and
mike
mister
mcgeough
felt
that
it
warranted
a
boarding
call
at
the
leafs
couldnt
get
anything
going
on
the
power
play
as
the
flyers
were
very
aggressive
for
a
change
on
the
kill
with
time
running
out
in
the
period
recchi
carried
through
the
neutral
zone
and
handed
to
lindros
as
they
approached
the
leafs
blue
line
they
were
in
a
crowd
with
wendell
clark
and
jamie
macoun
lindros
tried
a
backhand
pass
to
recchi
through
the
feet
of
macoun
that
connected
to
recchi
but
then
clark
checked
recchi
off
the
puck
macoun
then
tried
to
clear
but
it
was
weak
and
went
right
to
mcgill
who
had
manned
the
point
he
drove
it
from
just
inside
the
blue
line
macoun
got
his
stick
on
it
and
deflected
it
past
his
own
goalie
at
shots
were
flyers
in
the
period
the
flyers
finally
got
their
first
chance
on
the
power
play
when
dave
andreychuk
tripped
up
rod
brindamour
in
his
offensive
zone
during
the
power
play
the
flyers
got
cheated
a
little
when
the
puck
popped
up
into
the
air
and
eric
gloved
it
down
but
mcgeough
thought
it
hit
his
stick
above
his
head
we
could
see
from
our
seats
at
the
other
end
of
the
ice
that
it
only
hit
his
glove
and
the
replay
confirmed
but
the
faceoff
went
to
the
other
end
as
time
was
running
out
in
the
advantage
lindros
found
galley
with
a
pass
across
the
goal
mouth
but
puppa
made
the
save
the
rebound
kicked
back
to
the
right
corner
where
recchi
picked
it
up
passed
it
out
to
eric
crashing
through
the
right
circle
and
eric
onetimed
past
puppa
at
with
the

before

with

although
the

had
most
of

the

the

and

keith

dave

then
took

and

at
to

up

on
the

showed
that
hawgoods
stick
stopped
making
contact
with
mcllwain
long
before
he
spun
around
and
fell
again
the
flyers
smothered
the
leafs
power
play
led
by
dimitri
yushkevich
bowen
made
a
thundering
hit
when
he
came
out
of
the
box
on
pearson
berehowski
tried
to
perplex
everybody
with
his
sloooowball
he
had
the
puck
at
the
point
and
just
trickled
a
pass
down
the
slot
he
made
all
the
flyers
look
silly
as
nobody
could
get
a
stick
on
it
and
it
got
to
gilmour
at
the
side
of
the
net
but
soderstrom
stoned
him
the
flyers
picked
things
up
offensively
after
the
kill
was
over
but
didnt
get
anything
home
shots
were
flyers
the
flyers
were
content
with
the
goal
lead
in
the
third
period
and
they
decided
that
if
tommy
wanted
a
shutout
he
was
going
to
have
to
work
for
it
a
little
the
flyers
got
most
of
the
scoring
chances
in
the
first
or
so
minutes
of
the
period
but
couldnt
get
past
puppa
then
the
leafs
got
tired
of
lindros
making
road
kill
out
of
them
and
tempers
flared
each
for
doug
gilmour
and
lindros
unsportsmanlike
conduct
and
each
for
glenn
anderson
and
mcgill
roughing
all
at
terry
carkner
then
took
a
kneeing
penalty
at
on
gilmour
again
the
flyers
smothered
the
leafs
power
play
at
about
the
minute
mark
dave
andreychuk
got
a
shot
away
from
his
left
circle
that
got
through
soderstrom
the
puck
was
rolling
on
its
side
and
as
luck
would
have
it
it
turned
away
from
the
net
instead
of
turning
towards
it
think
of
how
a
rolling
quarter
inevitably
starts
to
lean
one
way
or
the
other
seconds
later
rod
brindamour
tripped
up
gilmour
at
to
give
the
leafs
another
chance
on
the
power
play
on
the
advantage
after
soderstrom
stoned
andreychuk
while
lying
down
andreychuk
got
the
rebound
through
soderstrom
but
from
behind
the
net
and
it
went
straight
through
and
was
swept
away
by
one
of
his
defensemen
they
kept
the
pressure
on
but
soderstrom
was
equal
and
preserved
the
shutout
recchi
cross
checked
ken
baumgartner
to
get
tempers
hot
and
start
a
brawl
at
no
punches
thrown
recchi
got
the
initial
minor
krushelnyski
baumgartner
and
lindros
each
got
roughing
minors
at
rouse
and
beranek
expressed
their
mutual
dislike
for
each
other
and
got
each
for
slashing
to
set
up
another
on
mike
eastwood
shoved
down
ryan
mcgill
in
the
flyers
zone
as
they
were
battling
for
the
puck
and
while
mcgill
was
down
he
ran
his
stick
across
mcgills
face
the
flyers
were
not
happy
with
that
at
all
al
conroy
paired
up
with
berehowski
and
started
throwing
punches
upward
well
al
held
his
own
much
to
the
delight
of
the
crowd
each
got
a
couple
punches
in
before
going
down
in
a
head
and
al
got
a
standing
o
penalties
eastwood
cross
check
game
clark
carkner
each
berehowski
and
conroy
each
fighting
at
so
a
major
penalty
for
the
rest
of
the
game
for
the
flyers
the
had
no
interest
in
stting
on
the
lead
hawgood
galley
and
brindamour
played
catch
until
hawgood
found
dineen
all
alone
in
the
left
circle
he
controlled
the
puck
and
blasted
it
past
puppa
at
that
was
all
the
fireworks
tommy
soderstrom
would
not
face
another
shot
puppa
did
but
kept
the
flyers
off
the
board
flyers
shots
were
flyers
in
the
probably
the
strongest
game
ive
seen
from
the
flyers
since
the
all
star
break
shutout
number
for
soderstrom
all
since
tied
for
most
in
the
nhl
but
hes
played
fewer
games
than
belfour
or
the
goalie
i
cant
remember
that
hes
tied
with
next
up
its
the
winnipeg
selannes
tuesday
night
in
winnipeg
the
flyers
cannot
be
eliminated
if
they
win
but
a
loss
coupled
with
an
islander
win
that
night
in
washington
would
be
the
official
end
flyers
up
to
points
on
the
season
in
games
last
year
they
had
points
in
games
under
so
they
need
at
least
points
in
their
last
games
to
improve
on
that
only
by
percentage
points
under
in
is
better
than
under
in
tragic
number
holds
at
points
with
games
left
the
tragic
number
for
is
points
i
watched
the
rangers
blow
a
third
period
lead
at
home
to
lose
before
i
finished
this
up
why
points
instead
of
well
the
flyers
will
win
the
tiebreaker
if
they
catch
them
whereas
the
islanders
win
tie
breakers
against
the
flyers
and
so
need
only
a
tie
the
rangers
could
crumble
down
the
stretch
as
they
play
the
devils
the
pens
twice
the
flyers
and
finish
up
with
games
against
the
caps
so
i
guess
place
could
be
the
goal
for
the

implicitly
you
are
assuming
that
goals
scored
against
winnipeg
with
selanne
on
the
ice
can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a
forward
winnipeg
has
a
lousy
defensive
record
anyway
lets
put
it
another
way
john
cullens
is
terrible
whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
are
you
comparing
cullen
to
salami
i
would
say
that
that
is
valid
if
winnipeg
is
such
a
lousy
defensive
team
then
why
the
hell
does
salami
stand
around
the
other
teams
blueline
when
the
puck
is
in
his
own
end
i
thought
that
he
was
comparing
cullen
to
teemu
selnne
i
always
thought
that
salami
is
some
sort
of
sausage
but
if
you
dear
roger
are
able
to
see
salami
on
the
ice
playing
hockey
i
dont
know
what
to
do
but
you
surely
should
do
something
and
very
quickly
maybe
you
think
that
if
you
keep
on
talking
some
rubbish
after
some
time
everybody
will
consider
it
to
be
really
true
you
should
take
care
of
your
leafs
they
surely
need
it
more
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
some
of
our
finnish
friends
who
have
watched
him
play
claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
style
of
contribution
would
be
more
conducive
to
winning
or
dont
you
think
so
at
least
we
have
seen
him
playing
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
during
the
latest
philly
game
the
leaf
players
didnt
parade
philly
crunched
them
maybe
you
need
some
more
two
way
players
who
can
score
too

always

if

it

i
cant

giving

they
didnt

much
to

to

him

lindros
seems
to
be
a
huge
draw
in

and
that
he
represents
a
successful

ottawa
may
be

i
was
thinking
about
who
on
each
of
the
teams
were
the
mvps
biggest
surprises
and
biggest
disappointments
this
year
now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
teams
the
same

mvp
most
valuable
player
to
his
team
both
in
terms
of
points
and
in
terms
of
leadership
cant
win
without
him
biggest
surprise
the
player
who
rose
above
expectation
the
player
that
may
have
raised
the
level
of
his
game
to
a
new
height
even
if
that
new
level
doesnt
necessarily
warrant
an
allstar
berth
includes
those
players
who
at
the
outset
of
the
season
may
not
even
have
been
in

biggest
disappointment
the
player
from
whom
we
expected
more
eg
i
picked
denis

with

its

hardly

nhl
will
become

that

it
can
create

any
diehard

know

the
reason
why

rauserfrasersfuca
richard
john
rauser
writes
ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
is
the
answer
as
simple
as
that
you
dislike
russians
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglass
so
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
and
where
would
canadian
hockey
be
today
without
the
europeans
dont
say
that
the
european
influence
on
the
league
has
been
all
bad
for
the
game
i
mean
look
at
the
way
you
play
these
days
less
fights
and
more
hockey
imho
canadian
hockey
has
had
a
positive
curve
of
development
since
the
when
the
game
was
more
brute
than
beauty
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
oh
look
you
dont
like
finns
either
i
just
dont
want
them

bad
almost
all

hmmm

what
kind

rauser
doesnt
sound
very
canadian
to
me
ps
when
analyzing
teams
like
italy
france

you
find

borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
from
where
i
come
from
in
canada
borshevsky
sounds
more
canadian
than
smith
anyways
crawl
back

the
hole
you
crawled
out
ofthe
nba
doesnt
care
where
they
get
basketball
players
from
major
league
baseball
doesnt
give
a
damn
where
they
get
baseball
players
from
except
cuba
that
is
canada
is
in
no
imminent
danger
of
being
overtaken
as
the
primary
supplier
of
playerssweden
finland
the
czech
republic
and
slovakia
are
all
relatively
small
countries
and
cannot
really
produce
players
at
a
greater
rate
than
they
are
already
producing
them
and
the
potential
influx
from
the
former
soviet
union
is
severely
blunted
because
the
system
has
been
raided
and
is
starved
for
finances
and
will
take
a
decade
or
two
to
recover
and
become
a
real
threat
and
the
us
will
just
maintain
its
slow
increase
canada
should
continue
to
supply
plus
of
the
top
hockey
players
in
the
world
for
the
forseeable
future
besides
we
need
the
european
hockey
market
if
hockey
is
to
take
its
rightful
place
besides
soccer
as
the
two
predominant
world
sportsand
since
soccer
is
essentially
boring
unlike
hockey
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
canadians
are
under
no
threatthe
european
numbers
will
soon
saturate
if
they
havent
alreadyand
by
the
time
russia
comes
online
again
the
nhl
should
be
a
world
league
and
there
will
be
many
more
teams
to
stock
and
many
more
jobs
for
canadian
hockey
players
in
the
near
team
the
percentage
of
canadians
will
mostly
decline
because
of
americans
not
because
of
europeans
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league

let
the
bures

the
number

in

was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going

if

get
you
are
out

ive
never
seen
a
game
where
one
player
has
committed
penalties
something
like
this
would
require
more
attention
by
the
referee
unsportsmanlike
contact
an
intentional

this
inlcludes
all
the
current
flavours
of
roughing

you

you
are
thrown

besides
the
penalty
shot
for
one
technical
if
the
team
gets
penalties
in
a
period
the
opposing
team
gets
a
penalty
shot
for
every
additional
one
until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
gets
two
shots
if
heshe
was
in
the
act
of
shooting
when
the
foul
ocured
this
works
well
for
several
reasons
first
penalty
shots
are
the
most
exciting
thing
in
hockey
right
so
it
follows
that
the
more
the
better
next
when
the
player
is
setting
up
for
a
penalty
shot
the
network
can
take
a
commercial
finally
with
only
three
penalties
the
network
announcers
don
meredith
dick
vitale
john
madden
pat
summerall
and
marv
levy
among
others
will
be
able
to
tell
the
viewers
what
happened
before
the
pa
announcer
says
it
but
youre
creating
a
scoring
opportunity
where
there
might
not
have
been
one
before
i
can
see
the
relationship
between
free
throws
awarded
after
a
certain
number
of
fouls
but
its
obviously
easier
to
score
in
basketball
there
are
more
opportunities
if
a
basketball
team
scores
points
thats
at
least
fifty
chances
made
the
average
number
of
shots
taken
by
each
team
in
a
hockey
game
and
this
is
a
total
guess
is
probably
around
and
a
team
is
lucky
to
capitalize
on
maybe
of
them
you
have
some
good
ideas
concerning
the
other
penalties
but
i
think
that
a
player
should
be
awarded
a
penalty
shot
only
when
they
had
a
chance
to
score
and
was
interfered
with
also
later
in
the
post
you
talked
about
how
boring
the
nba
game
you
attended
was
that
play
was
stopped
too
often
wouldnt
your

shot
rule
take
up
more
time

shots
if
heshe
was
in

act
of

when
the
foul
ocured
these
new
rule
changes
are
great
however
i
think
that
your
rules
are
much
too
complicated
how
will
the
normal
average
fan
be
able
to
count
how
many
fouls
a
player
has
and
then
we
would
even
have
to
remember
the
names
of
the
players
in
order
to
determine
who
drew
the
foul
and
of
course
there
will
have
to
be
new
subpositions
like
the
power
center
who
just
sits
in
the
slot
until
the
blue
of
course
puck
comes
near
him
and
the
shooting

and
the

well
be
able

keep
stats

the

has

this

since
too

was

the

is
melrose

this

is
still
and

like
sanderson

performing

offensively
once
he
was

will

hard
they
have
to

him
out
on

im
not
a

to
begin
with
well
being
a

i
sometimes
wish
that
bure
would
get
knocked
silly
too
nothing
serious
just
enough
to
keep
him
out
of
a
game
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
in
most
cases
the
owners
have
very
little
to
do
with
it
they
give
their
general
managers
one
order
when
it
comes

the

me
the

that
our
team
will

whether
that
player
is
in
kindersley
saskatchewan
or
chelyabinsk
russia
if
the
gm
believes
him
to
be
the
better
player
the
gm
should
be
drafting
him
where
do
you
get
off
calling
the
nhl
their
league
when
referring
to
canadian
players
it
doesnt
belong
to
them
it
belongs
to
the
owners
the
owners
can
do
what
they
want
while
a
canadian
content
rule
might
be
enforcable
here
in

there
is
enough
doubt
that
it
would
be
enforcable
in

the

sorry

oh
yeah
and
how
many
europeans
play
at
the
lower
levels
of
professional
hockey
in
north

while
there
are
some
that
play
in

ahl

where
thats
an

you
dont

do

yes
ylnen
is

of

of

this
is
the

ylnen
that
played
for
kiekkoespoo
in
he
was

pick
of

in

lisa
subject
re
too
many
europeans
in
nhl
somebody
wrote
id
love
to
see
a
european
nhl
division
but
cant
see
it
happen
for
some
time
theres
simply
not
enough
fan
interest
at
the
moment
in
several
crucial
markets
like
germany
italy
and
france
while
sweden
and
finland
probably
cant
afford
to
shell
out
for
tickets
the
way
americancanadian
fans
do
call
it
the
minnesota
north
stars
effect
scandinavians
do
love
hockey
but
we
prefer
to
watch
local
inexpensive
hockey
to
the
nhl
the
national
hockey
league
should
love
the
idea
though
paneuropean
tv
channels
such
as
eurosport
could
bring
in
the
millions
the
american
networks
likely
never
will
pay
this
brings
up
a
question
i
asked
myself
no
answer
when
it
was
mentionned
that
the
nhl
could
expand
in
europe
would
most
of
the
northamericans
now
playing
in
the
nhl
be
willing
to
play
for
a
team
in
europe
i
do
not
think
that
the
majority
of
hockey
players
are
necessarily
interested
in
expanding
their
cultural
experience
to
that
level
i
know
i
would
but
i
am
not
a
pro
hockey
player
when
one
recalls
some
players
remarks
in
the
last
few
years
it
makes
me
wonder
how
a
european
expansion
could
be
achieved
remember
these
lindros
did
not
want
to
play
in
quebec
for
more
than
reasons
nicholls
in
edmonton
r
courtnall
wanted
to
be
traded
to
la
only
c
lemieux
said
he
would
refuse
to
go
to
edmonton
earlier
this
year
i
know
there
are
many
noncultural
reasons
behind
these
but
there
is
more
some
american
players
who
played
for
the
expos
complained
about
the
french
fact
and
that
the
city
was
not
quite
like
the
other
us
cities
one
players
wife
trying
to
make
her
point
went
on
to
complain
that
she
could
not
even
find
her
favorite
brand
of
nacho
chips
in
montreal
anybody
knows
what
happened
when
all
these
us
football
players
moved
to
london
spain
etc
for
the
one
year
of
that
new
football
league
years
ago
i
wonder
what
the
players
association
thinks
about
going
to
europe
myself
i
would
like
to
see
some
european
teams
but
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
do
it

being
aggressive
slashing
chauvanistic

venting
frustration
fighting
proof
that
males
cannot
cope
with
their
feelings
no
no
no
since
all
the
penalties
fall
into
three
classes
there
should
only
be
three
penalties
foul
any
illegal
contact
with
the
other
player
or
his
stick
with
your
body
or
stick
if
you
get
you
are
out
for
the
game
unsportsmanlike
contact
an
intentional
foul
this
inlcludes
all
the
current
flavours
of
roughing
fighting
and
boarding
if
you
get
two
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
and
fined
technical
foul
bad
mouthing
the
ref
by
player
or
coach
penalty
shot
is
awarded
two
and
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
besides
the
penalty
shot
for
one
technical
if
the
team
gets
penalties
in
a
period
the
opposing
team
gets
a
penalty
shot
for
every
additional
one
until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
gets
two
shots
if
heshe
was
in
the
act
of
shooting
when
the
foul
ocured
this
works
well
for
several
reasons
first
penalty
shots
are
the
most
exciting
thing
in
hockey
right
so
it
follows
that
the
more
the
better
next
when
the
player
is
setting
up
for
a
penalty
shot
the
network
can
take
a
commercial
finally
with
only
three
penalties
the
network
announcers
don
meredith
dick
vitale
john
madden
pat
summerall
and
marv
levy
among
others
will
be
able
to
tell
the
viewers
what
happened
before
the
pa
announcer
says
it
oh
one
other
rule
when
a
goal
is
scored
times
a
period
the
play
cannot
resume
until
the
pa
announcer
announces
it
this
way
the
network
can
sneak
in
a
few
more
commercials
then
once
the
pa
announcer
has
told
them
who
scored
the
tv
announcer
can
tell
you
the
viewer
and
even
have
a
chance
of
pronouncing
his
name
right
seriously
though
i
actually
went
to
see
a
nba
basketball
game
last
week
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
amazed
how
boring
it
was
the
play
is
so
slow
they
actually
had
fans
come
out
for
things
like
freethrow
shooting
contests
during
the
period
of
course
the
laker
girls
get
to
do
their
routines
at
least
times
during
the
game
and
not
just
between
periods
either
there
is
a
whistle
every
seconds
on
average
maybe
less
the
game
is
minutes
with
minutes
between
quarters
and
and
a
minute
halftime
and
it
still
takes
over
hours
the
reason
for
this
has
to
be
tv
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
throw
in
commercials
and
have
the
announcer
jabber
while
nothing
else
is
happening
on
tv
basketball
is
fairly
entertaining
imho
but
it
is
better
to
watch
it
on
tv
than
to
be
there
if
this
is
the
road
the
nhl
is
following
then
it
truly
is
a
sad
day
enough
for
now

barasso
the
cheap
shot
master
after
watching
the
pengiuns
all
year
and
as
many
other
teams
as
possible
ive
really
noticed
an
increase
in
tom
barassos
cheap
shots
this
year
and
not
noticed
a
corrsponding
increase
with
other
goaltenders
ive
also
noticed
that
he
usually
gets
away
with
it
just
as
examples
last
night
i
noticed
him
elbowing
scott
stevens
in
the
head
which
basically
started
the
whole
shoving
match
that
got
stevens
scott
and
tocchet
minute
minors
he
also
kicked
john
mclean
of
course
he
wasnt
called
for
that
isnt
kicking
an
automatic
match
penalty
and
game
suspension
i
think
glenn
anderson
got
one
a
few
years
ago
for
kicking
gaetan
duchesne
in
the
chest
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
barasso
is
the
dirtiest
golatender
since
hextall
hes
also
very
good
how
about
that
tocchet
headbutt
is
there
an
automatic
susppension
that
goes
along
with
a
nonkicking
match
penalty
i
cant
remember
anymore
oh

ralph

re
how
to

from

matyas
now
if
we
could
just
clone
chelioss
personality
and
transplant
it
into
all
of
the
defensemen
on
the
islanders
capitals
and
devils
gerald
in
other
words
you
want
to
turn
them
all
into
assholes
so
they
will
spend
lots
of
time
in
the
penalty
box
and
get
lots
of
misconducts
and
this
comes
from
a
chelios
fan
yeah
and
also
be
second
in
the
team
in
scoring
and
play
about
minutes
a
game
and
play
on
the
power
play
and
kill
penalties
and
be
the
best
defenseman
in
the
league
id
take
a
whole
team
of
chelioses
if
i
could
that
way
when
one
got
a
penalty
the
others
could
kill
it

mattbhawksamsungcom
matt
brown
writes
more
about
the
messiersamuelsson
incident
while
this
is
true
strictly
speaking
it
was
the
rocksteady
replicant
who
initially
used
his
stick
illegally
to
measure
messiers
ribcage
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
from
seeing
the
replay
in
slomo
that
was
coming
at
messier
with
intenttohasta
la
vista
in
mind
and
should
have
been
gone
for
that
i
agree
with
rick
that
ulfs
cross
check
wasnt
illegal
it
was
the
kind
of
check
you
see
a
dozen
times
during
a
game
without
being
called
slomos
sometimes
have
a
tendency
to
make
things
look
worse
than
they
really
are
besides
if
messier
cant
take
the
heat
he
should
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
so
staffan
how
is
mattias
timmander
doing
this
year
and
any
impression
on
markus
czeriew
lost
my
roster
list
on
hammerby
does
it
look
like
they
will
make
it
to
the
eliteserien
for
next
year
and
then
get
stomped
if
markus
goes
to
boston
well
matt
mattias
timmander
hasnt
been
playing
with
the
modo
elite
league
team
yet
just
the
modo
junior
team
so
i
predict
he
needs
a
few
more
years
here
before
he
can
join
the
bs
i
saw
him
play
in
the
swedish
championship
game
for
junior
players
this
year
and
he
played
very
well
a
physical
game
but
not
the
kind
of
rough
stuff
that
ulfie
does
i
suspect
you
would
like
to
have
a
ulf
typeofplayer
on
the
bs
team
too
as
for
mariusz
czerkawski
he
has
had
a
great
season
for
hammarby
in
division
he
scored
if
i
remember
correctly
points
this
season
and
then
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
point
season
in
sweden
is
considered
very
good
due
to
the
limited
number
of
games
mariusz
is
djurgarden
property
he
was
just
on
loan
to
hammarby
so
he
will
play
in
elitserien
next
season
unless
the
bs
can
get
him
of
course
i
would
say
that
mariusz
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
player
to
watch
in
swedish
hockey
this
season

isles
hockey
ramblings
well
the
patrick
division
got
a
little
more
interesting
last
night
the
islanders
lost
in
ot
and
the
devils
tied
the
pens
that
means
if
the
isles
beat
the
devils
on
friday
the
will
meet
the
caps
in
the
playoffs
however
i
have
some
more
comments
on
the
islanders
and
hockey
in
general
that
i
need
to
get
off
my
chest
first
of
all
with
the
islanders
backtoback
lackluster
performances
against
the
whalers
one
may
think
that
the
islanders
are
out
of
shape
these
guys
always
suck
wind
in
the
period
come
on
a
little
in
the
and
run
out
of
gas
too
soon
it
is
unbelieveable
how
many
one
goal
games
these
guys
have
lost
anyway
the
games
was
pretty
wide
open
the
isles
still
have
tons
of
trouble
scoring
the
whalers
played
a
golie
in
is
nhl
start
i
think
his
name
was
lenarduzzi
sp
his
nhl
debut
was
the
tuesday
tie
against
the
isles
like
i
mentioned
before
this
guy
looked
like
the
best
golie
on
the
planet
for
a
while
until
he
misplayed
a
mahlakov
slap
shot
to
go
to
ot
i
say
its
because
the
isles
dont
shoot
correctly
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
also
i
think
it
is
really
a
shame
for
hockey
when
i
guy
like
mick
vukota
gets
as
much
ice
time
as
he
does
this
guy
has
about
as
much
hockey
talent
as
jiggs
macdonald
who
did
play
hockey
i
think
anytime
he
gets
the
puck
it
gets
stolen
and
he
always
starts
fights
and
gets
needless
penalties
richard
pilon
is
another
guy
who
is
on
the
ice
to
stir
up
crap
and
hes
a
defenseman
hes
got
to
be
approaching
negative
infinity
for
his
plusminus
this
guy
gets
beaten
all
the
time
why
the
need
for
such
enforcers
not
only
do
fights
slow
the
game
down
alot
but
it
takes
away
from
the
guys
who
are
really
trying
to
play
the
game
ill
be
one
of
the
few
to
admit
i
do
enjoy
a
good
fight
once
in
a
while
but
only
when
its
called
for
you
know
when
a
guy
checks
the
goalie
too
hard
in
other
words
a
violation
of
hockey
ethics
might
cause
you
to
get
puched
but
there
is
no
need
to
start
crap
when
you
are
losing
or
becuase
you
can
get
away
with
it
does
anyone
agree
that
referees
need
to
be
a
little
less
lenient
in
the
and
ot
i
mean
come
on
already
im
sick
of
seeing
teams
pulling
guys
down
holding
guys
etc
just
becuase
the
referee
doesnt
call
it
ot
and
late
in
the
should
be
a
time
for
strategy
not
physical
prowess
trying
to
set
up
a
goal
should
be
first
and
foremost
if
you
are
so
afraid
that
the
other
team
is
going
to
score
that
you
have
to
pull
a
guy
down
to
prevent
it
you
dont
deserve
to
win

place

you

this

the

nhl

wont
see
any

no

the

a

could

is
the

ask

about

actually
this
stuff
from

doesnt
surprise
me
all
that
much
about
or
weeks
ago
i
read
in
the
toronto
sun
a
quote
from
alex
it
went
something
like
sarcastically
yep
pattys
the
man
hes
responsible
for
the
teams
successim
a
nobody
around
here
i
was
going
to
post
it
at
the
timei
must
have
forgot
since
nobody
else
was
talking
about
him
being
a
problem
if
i
heard
that
in
the
locker
room
id
beat
the
shit
out
of
him
on
the
spot
patty
took
responsibility
in
the
press
taking
the
heat
off
of
alex
thats
because
lafontaine
is
the
epitome
of
class
and
a
consummate
team
player
yep
id
beat
the
shit
out
of
him
too
lafontaine
really
must
be
a
team
playermakes
you
wonder
what
the
islander
management
was
thinking
my
question
is
what
the
hell
is
muckler
doing
whether
he
wishes
to
admit
it
or
not
the
team
is
his
to
coach
and
if
he
cant
do
the
job
then
maybe
the
job
should
be
given
to
somebody
who
can

im
sorry
to
tell
you
this
but
unless
they
pull
off
another
miracle
there
is
no
way
the
habs
will
win
this
year
ever
since
they
traded
for
ramage
and
since
savard
came
off
injury
they
have
been
playing
shinny
and
you
cant
blame
roy
for
the
loss
to
washington
when
players
could
not
score
one
goal
i
know
you
think
i
am
a
boston
fan
but
all
of
my
years
have
been
dedicated
to
les
habs
david
degan
well
it
seems
that
the
habs
have
been
much
talkedabout
of
late
so
heres
my
these
guys
have
absolutely
no
concept
of
how
to
play
in
front
of
the
damn
net
watch
them
in
the
offensive
zone
especially
on
the
powerplay
damphousse
or
lebeau
will
skate
all
over
the
bloody
zone
maybe
pass
to
the
point
get
it
back
skate
some
more
pass
it
aroundbut
wheres
the
shot
answer
the
shot
is
totally
useless
because
they
lack
a
forward
who
stands
in
front
of
the
net
a
la
neely
shanahan
tocchet
etc
etc
too
bad
demers
wont
put
dipietro
or
leclair
on
the
powerplay
more
often
dammit
even
ewen
would
at
least
cause
some
disruptions
montreal
desperately
needs
a
power
forward
with
some
talent
imo
then
watch
them
in
their
own
zone
patrick
roy
is
screened
on
everything
say
what
you
want
about
his
performance
imnsho
he
cannot
stop
what
he
cannot
see
and
montreals
defence
does
a
miserable
job
of
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
last
night
against
washington
roy
played
a
great
game
the
first
goal
came
on
the
most
ridiculous
goalmouth
scramble
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
and
he
didnt
have
a
hope
in
hell
of
stopping
the
shot
the
second
goal
came
on
a
deflection
of
a
shot
he
only
partially
saw
anyway
pathetic

the
third
goal
was

he

the

this
should
be

im
hoping

but
i
agree
that
boston
will
likely
win
the
series
goaltending
is
about
equal
top
offensive
players
are
about
equal
mogilnylafontaine

but
buffalo
has
no
answer
to
neely
not
to

that
neely
is
not
a
top
offensive
player
btw
in
fact
hes
one
of
my
favourites
even
though
hes
a
damn
bruin
and
the
rest
of
the
matchup
wrt
lineup
favours
boston
anyway
but
i
think
it
will
go
six
quebec
vs
montreal
this
one
is
very
tough
to
call
montreal
certainly
has
the
experience
factor
but
quebec
is
more
talented
imho
itll
come
down
to
the
goalies
ill
go
with
experience
and
roy
canadiens
in
agreed
herebut
montreal
will
be
pushed
to
the
limit
is
it
just
me
or
does
everything
montreal
does
in
the
playoffs
come
down
to
roy
go
habs
final
boston
vs
montreal
will
bruin
domination
continue
in
this
rivalry
yes
moog
has
consistently
outperformed
roy
in
the
playoffs
after
stuff
bruins
in
five
i
cant
predict
a
montreal
victory
because
ive
been
watching
them
play
for
weeks
and
imo
they
severly
need
some
tougher
players
especially
to
play
in
the
garden
last
time
they
beat
the
bs
but
boston
had
a
clear
territorial
advantage
the
victory
was
roys
at
the
same
time
i
cant
bring
myself
to
predict
the
possibility
of
a
loss
so
ill
just
say
i
will
not
be
putting
money
on
this
series
patrick
division
semifinal
pittsburgh
vs
ny
islanders
what
can
i
say
the
pens
are
flying
high
and
have
the
most
talent
in
the
league
agreed
ny
doesnt
have
the
goaltending
to
stop
the
onslaught
independent
of
the
trouble
they
have
given
pittsburgh
this
year
pens
in
five
which
is
credit
to
ny
washington
vs
new
jersey
capitals
in
agreed
here
too
but
i
think
it
will
go
at
least
six
jersey
has
a
decent
team
and
washington
has
done
poorly
against
the
division
this
year
pittsburgh
vs
washington
if
the
caps
had
bill
ranford
i
might
see
an
upset
but
don
beaupre
just
doesnt
inspire
my
hopes
penguins
in
i
think
they
will
use
tabaracci
more
after
beaupre
gets
shelled
i
dont
think
it
will
go
six
eithermaybe
five
conference
final
pittsburgh
vs
boston
a
replay
of
last
year
the
penguins
are
just
as
good
as
months
ago
and
the
bruins
are
much
improved
but
penguins
in
if
pittsburgh
plays
boston
imo
they
win
in
likely
five
possibly
six
they
own
the
bruins
if
they
play
montreal
i
think
it
will
go
to
seven
and
once
again
i
wont
be
putting
money
on
the
seventh
game
i
say
seven
because
the
habs
have
played
pittsburgh
very
tough
this
season
campbell
conference
norris
division
semifinal
chicago
vs
st
louis
or
minnesota
blackhawks
in
chicago
will
win
but
i
think
in
at
least
six
chicago
is
not
that
good
imo
and
remember
that
they
take
ridiculous
numbers
of
penalties
detroit
vs
toronto
the
leafs
have
had
an
excellent
season
but
theyve
been
playing
playoff
hockey
all
year
the
habs
under
burns
were
the
same
way
and
always
wilted
in
the
playoffs
red
wings
in
very
true
the
leafs
have
much
to
be
proud
of
but
they
will
soon
find
out
why
montreal
did
so
lousy
in
the
playoffs
toronto
might
win
two
or
three
at
mlg
though
wings
in
six
maybe
even
seven
final
chicago
vs
detroit
this
will
be

fedorov

in

warpossibly
the
most
intense
playoff

yes

they
get
hammered
by
a

chasing
them
calgarywinnipeg
in

calgary
vs
los
angeles
this
would
have
been
tough
to
call
except
for
three
things
the
kings
dont
have
a
goalie
gary
roberts
will
be
back
the
kings
shot
themselves
in
the
foot
by
trading
a
proven
winner
paul
coffey
for
a
proven
loser
jimmy
carson
gretzky
is
just
too
weary
to
carry
this
group
flames
in
this
is
also
tough
for
me
to
call
because
i
havent
seen
the
smythe
enough
i
dont
think
roberts
will
be
well
enough
to
figure
in
coffey
is
a
nonissue
who
cares
what
carson
has
done
before
and
never
underestimate
gretzky
la
in
six
final
vancouver
vs
calgary
flames
in
if
it
is
these
two
calgary
will
not
need
six
games
but
i

in
six
stanley
cup
final
pittsburgh
vs
detroit
three
in
a
row
and
official

status
for
the

or
can
the
wings
complete
a
dream
season
well
the
wings
are
better
in
goal
not
sufficiently
so
though
imho
and
have
better
dmen
however
mario
and
the
boys
can
sure
score
look
for
jagr
to
shine
in
the
playoffs
though
i
sure
would
love
to
see
probert
beat
some
sense
into
him
the
pens
are
just
too
much
especially
since
detroit
will
have
a
tougher
battle
to
get
here
penguins
in
if
pittsburgh
plays
detroit
it
will
go
longer
than
five
and
i
wouldnt
bet
against
the
wings
they
are
very
strong
imo
and
nobody
knows
how
strong
because
theyve
been
underachieving
most
of
the
year
if
forced
to
choose
though
id
have
to
take
the
penguins
a
side
note
vlad
last
week
you
said
that
selanne
was
a
better
player
than
gilmour
no
way
he
is
a
more
talented
pure
goal
scorerbut
aside
from
the
age
difference
there
is
no
way
i
would
take
him
over
gilmour
on
my
team
im
not
asking
for
flames
either
btwive
spent
more
than
enough
time
arguing
on
behalf
of
selanne
and
i
still
say
hes
a
great
player
but
while
he
and
gilmour
are
both
dangerous
offensively
give
teemu
an
edge
gilmour
does
it
all
i
know
a
lot
of
gilmourbashing
goes
on
esp
from
flame
fans
but
imo
you
guys
are
letting
your
dislike
of
gilmour
cloud
your
judgement
when
it
comes
to
his
skill
he
is

whats

bad

the
new

format
do
you
really
believe
teams
that
finish
fourth
in
their
div
deserve
to
be
in
the

with
the

you
have

more
teams
do
you
really
want

sabres
umpteen
times
or
would
you
rather
see
the
bruins
and
the
capitals
in
the
secound
round
of
playoffs
there
is
really
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
but
they
tried
it
just
a
little
over
a
decade
ago
and
noone
showed
up
for
the
early
rounds
in
the
playoffswhereas
soon
after
they
went
to
the
divisional
setup
arenas
were
mostly
filled
in
the
early
rounds
the
empirical
evidence
of
the
last
two
decades
is
that
more
people
will
show
up
to
see
the
bruins
play
the
sabre
umpteen
times
than
see
the
bruins
play
the
captials
in
the
first
round
maybe
hockey
has
increased
in
popularity
sufficiently
that
this
will
no
longer
be
the
case

experiment
is
worthwhile

re

you
might
want
to
clarify
the
game
winning
streak
that
pens
streak
is
a
playoff
streak
tied
by
the
chicago
blackhawks
who
had
won
in
a
row
until
they
met
the
pens
in
the
finals
last
year
the
game
unbeaten
so
far
is
a
regular
season
unbeaten
streak
but
hey
dont
take
it
personally
im
a
flyers
fan
and
two
in
a
row
is
a
stretch
but
with
a
healthy
lindros
recchi
brindamour
and
tommy
soderstrom
theyll
be
there
next
year
by
the
way
since
the
flyers
need
defenseman
what
kind
of
trade
would
anybody
suggest
from
the

roster
since
the

is
that

that

the

let
toronto

detroit
beat

the

goes

again
then
bring

the

therefore
they

their

hasnt
really

i
dont

what
the

numbers
were

i
believe

either
the

will
cause

for
what
is
this

crap
im

fan
and
hope
they
win
if
they
end
up
facing

but
i
dont

the

lose

of
lack

yes
the

won

series
against

theyve
won
eighteen
games
in

for
gods
sake
did
you
ever
think
the

might
be
good
and
thats
why
they
win
i
reread
what
i
wrote
and
it
didnt
say
exactly
what
i
thought
sure
the
pens
are
a
better
team
theyve
got
size
and
the
best
skill
players
in
the
league
theyve
also
got
the
best
clutch
goaltending
theyre
the
best
team
in
the
league
but
my
point
was
the
caps
have
not
played
to
their
ability
level
vs
the
pens
since
last
years
choke
and
thats
the
mental
problem
the
one
theyve
had
for
a
number
of
years
i
tried
to
point
out
spirit
mental
preparedness
will
to
win
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
missing

youre

hockey

roger
what
exactly

should
have
clued
you
in
to
the
fact
that
my
leaf
woofing
was
tongueincheek
if
playoff
hockey
is
any
more
intense
than
the
regular
season
variety
then
it
is
because
the
teams
are
facing
each
other
at
least
consecutive
times
in
days
and
hockey
being
the
contact
sport
that
it

things

dont

damn

course
i
cant
say
this
for
sure
but
i
believe
that
this
is
fairly
typical
of
human
nature
and
i
dont
think
that
hockey
players
are
above
having
what
i
consider
typically
human
attitudes
with
the
recent
salary
escalations
the
key
players
are
actually
losing
money
by
participating
in
the
playoffs
the
ones
who
regard
the
playoff
take
as
some
kind
of
a
bonanza
are
fringe
players
who
are
unlikely
to
consistently
be
a
force
in
the
playoffs
now
i
know
some
of
you
are
going
to
come
back
with
winning
spirit
and
all
of
that
crap
but
these
players
are
professionals
after
all
while
they
may
love
to
play
the
game
that
love
is
entirely
incidental
to
their
purpose
which
is
to
make
a
decent
living
of
course
the
coach
is
a
professional
as
well
and
part
of
what
he
is
being
paid
to
do
is
motivate
the
players
so
if
the
coach
does
his
job
well
enough
the
players
may
respond
with
a
winning
effort
the
second
season
is
after
all
merely
an
exhibition
the
true
champions
of
the
league
are
the
division
winners
the
teams
that
come
out
on
top
after
the
long
struggle
of
the
season
the

merely
accord
victory
to
the
team
that
has
remained
healthy
and
hot
the
emphasis
on
the

with

appeal
has
been

by

pens
team
defense
they
are
hovering
around
or
in
the
fewest
goals
allowed
that
is
a
big
improvement
for
them
and
it
indicates
that
they
are
playing
better
team
defense
can
shut
down
the
pens
offense
and
get
an
early
goal
then
you
have
a
real
game
if
the
pens
score
first
then
its
practically
over
i
dont
think
the
pens
have
the
discipline
to
stick
to
the
team
game
if
theyre
held
scoreless
minutes
into
the
second
boston
doesnt
have
the
guns
of
the
pens
but
the
pens
doesnt
have
the
defense
goaltending
and
discipline
of
boston
still
boston
can
put
the
puck
in
the
net
remember
that
boston
is
not
a
runandgun
patrickstyle
team
although
they
played
runandgun
hockey
for
the
better
part
of
the
regular
season
who
doesnt
even
neely
backchecks
all
the
way
in
behind
his
own
net
if
necessary
penaltykilling
will
be
a
big
factor
boston
are
i
believe
over
the
last
shorthanded
situations
meaning
they
have
scored
shg
while
giving
up
ppg
one
in
a
lackluster
game
against
ottawa
id
say
the
series
will
go
to
or
but
im
much
less
certain
whether
it
will
be
in
favor
of
the
pens
or
the
bs
their
styles
going
into
the
playoffs
are
too
different
to
make
it
predictable
still
id
place
my
bets
on
the
pens
i
think
my
prediction
is
that
if
the
bs
can
get
the
first
goal
in
four
of
the
games
theyll
take
the
series
otherwise
the
pens
will
but
id
rather
wait
and
see
whether
the
bs
will
actually
get
out
of
the
adams
to
begin
with
buffalo
quebec
and

arent
exactly

it
is
an

yes
lemieux
and
gilmour
are
good
defensive
players
but
they
play
a
more
offensively

style
than
a
true
defensive

this

you

guys

the
guys
who
can
both
check
and
score

be
candidates
is
that
right
the
selke
candidate
forwards
main
purpose
on
a
shift
is
to
prevent
goals
from
being
scored
not
to
score
them
when
lemieux
or
gilmour
play
their
number
one
purpose
is
to
score
defence
is
secondary
especially
considering
the
line
that
plays
against
them
is
probably
a
defensive
one
that
is
why
they
are
not

candidates
when
tarasov
called
bob
gainey
the
best
player
in
the
world
it
was
assumed
that
he
meaned
the
best
technical
player
the
one
who
knew
every
intricacy
about
playing
hockey
and
never
made
a
technical
error
and
who
was
it
that
made
this
assumption
all
of
your
friends
maybe
sorry
greg
but
people
arent
enoughyou
can
assume
all
that
you
want
to
but
if
you
think
tarasov
was
serious
then
you
are
an
idiot
someone
posted
something
about
this
assumption
being
lost
in
translation
it
was
a
few
months
ago
whoever
this
was
please
repost
it
i
agree
with
this
assessment
bob

may
have
been
the
best
technical
player
ever
right
greg
did
you
see
this
in
the
sun
or
something
what
did
you
think
of
claude
provost
gainey
was
nothing
more
than
a
journeyman
player
whos
outstanding
abilities
were
entirely
political
he
might
have
had
a
col
lection
of
defensive
skills
but
he
had
absolutely
no
offensive
skills
at
all
none
but
perhaps
you
think
that
the
abilities
to
pass
the
puck
shoot
the
puck
and
deke
a
goalie
or
defenseman
are
not
technical
skills
gainey
is
the
best
defensive
forward
ever
i
stand
by
that
assessment
he
was
a
very
good
player
who
belongs
in
the
hall
of
fame
did
you
ever
watch
him

he
never

ill

the

you
dont

go
through
the

you
are

all
you

is
the

average
by
summing
all
the

and
divide
by
the
total
number
of
players
on
the

this
will
be
a
little
distorted
because
the
players
who
have
been

recently
will
have
come
with
scores
based
on
their
original
teams
this
shouldnt
distort
it
too
bad
though
if
you
want
to
look
at
individual
players
from
this
perspective
then
go
ahead
youll
require
the
original
player
stats
though
question
if
a
team
uses
players
in
a
season
do
you
merely
divide
the
total
by
if
so
a
player
who
plays
in
only
game
is
considered
equally
valuable
as
a
player
who
plays
in
all
of
them
another
way
of
looking
at
the
same
thing
is
to
compare
the
deviation
from
the
mean
for
the
team
of
the
player
to
the
standard
deviation
for
the
team
ill
post
both
since
the
standard
deviation
for
each
team
is
different
i
am
unsure
how
transferable
between
teams
that
these
stats
are
shouldnt
the

main

purpose

well
suffice

say
that
it
is
a
sport
for

heres
something
do
you
think
that
the
availability

hockey
could
contribute
to
a
rise

i
would

this

that

quite
modest
i
might

well
i
dont
recall
assuming
anything

perhaps
that
the

telling

the

alex

his

says
chances
this

but
it
seems
to
me
like
washington
is
the
only
team
that
can
stop
the
penguins
from
winning
their
next
stanley
cup
really
i
think
both
the
islanders
and
devils
would
have
a
better
chance
at
the
penguins
than
the
capitals
imo
really
what
makes
you
think
the
islanders
have
a
better
shot
they
couldnt
even
beat
the
whalers
in
two
games
yes
but
as
has
been
mentioned
many
times
before
the
islanders
play
at
the
talent
level
of
their
opponent
since
hartford
is
pitiful
the
islanders
played
pitiful
since
pittsburgh
is
great
the
isles
will
most
likely
play
great
this
is
most
likely
due
to
inexperience
and
very
poor
shooting
to
greg
yes
i
have
noticed
that
the
islanders
couldnt
hit
the
broad
side
of
a
barn
with
the
puck
if
they
were
two
feet
in

of
it
does
anyone
have
shooting
percentages
i
dont
know
if
that
would
help
since
they
often
miss
the

completely

it
might
shed

light

was
a
on

the

was

a

he
threw
at

got
a
good
carom
and
it
ended
up
behind
the
goalie
on
the
second
nylander
goal
he
got
three
whacks
at
the
puck
before
it
went
in
this
is
the
most
frustrating
part
of
the
flyers
defense
take
the
body
and
if
they
get
one
shot
and
beat
you
fine
dont
give
them
another
chance
carkner
galley
and
mcgill
are
all
terrible
about
this
ill
bet
money
at
least
one
of
them
was
the
closest
flyer
to
the
play
thats
all
i
have
my
radio
got
bad
after
that
and
i
was
lucky
to
know
who
it
was
that
scored
much
less
how
from
what
i
heard
roussel
had
a
very
strong
game
after
the
game
gene
hart
asked
bobby
taylor
to
pick
the
three
stars
of
the
season
rather
than
of
the
game
it
was
garry
galley
for
his
career
high
point
total
im
surprised
that
a
former
goalie
wouldnt
look
closer
at
his
defensive
play
tommy
soderstrom
for
his
team
record
tying
shutouts
in
only
about
a
season
and
mark
recchi
for
his
all
time
high
team
single
season
scoring
mark
but
heres
the
odd
part
he
couldnt
decide
between
lindros
and
recchi
for
number
if
he
picks
recchi
as
after
he
had
a
hard
time
choosing
between
him
and
lindros
doesnt
that
make
lindros
what
you
wanna
know
my
three
stars
of
the
season
well
since
you
asked
eric
lindros
eric
dominates
a
game
simply
by
stepping
out
onto
the
ice
the
difference
between
the
teams
record
with
him
and
without
him
is
no
accident
i
believe
that
the
team
could
have
been
almost
as
successful
without
recchi
there
is
no
question
that
this
team
is
significantly
better
with
eric
lindros
on
it
and
i
think
that
he
will
deservedly
wear
the
c
on
his
jersey
next
season
tommy
soderstrom
shutouts
was
second
in
the
league
to
only
ed
belfour
and
tommy
didnt
have
a
chris
chelios
booo
in
front
of
him
he
also
didnt
play
a
complete
season
due
to
heart
problems
sentimental
edge
here
my
family
has
a
history
of
heart
problems
theres
no
question
in
my
mind
that
tommy
soderstrom
is
this
teams
goalie
of
the
future
and
if
roussel
complains
again
about
being
number
look
for
him
to
be
traded
within
years
mark
recchi
again
you
cant
argue
with
an
alltime
team
high
single
season
scoring
mark
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
teams
that
didnt
have
a
single
player
get
as
many
points
plus
mark
is
the
only
flyer
to
play
the
entire
season
not
a
tough
choice
honorable
mentions
rod
brindamour
topped
his
single
season
high
point
total
which
he
set
last
year
the
difference
was
that
he
wasnt
on
the
top
line
this
year
and
didnt
get
as
much
playing
time
then
again
he
didnt
get
the
defensive
attention
that
he
got
last
year
from
the
other
team
either
dimtri
yushkevich
was
the
teams
most
consistent
defenseman
yes
he
made
rookie
mistakes
but
he
was
usually
fast
enough
to
make
up
for
them
i
have
a
feeling
that
with
his
shot
hell
score
a
few
more
points
next
year
without
giving
up
anything
in
his
own
zone
and
i
suspect
that
hell
be
the
teams
top
defenseman
in
years
to
come
garry
galley
was
the
teams
point
leader
from
defensemen
again
there
are
some
things
you
just
cant
argue
with
and
he
battled
with
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
he
certainly
deserves
kudos
for
only
missing
one
game
and
that
was
against
his
wishes
under
doctors
orders
but
his
defensive
play
often
negates
his
offensive
contribution
a
little
more
caution
and
a
little
bit
smarter
in
his
own
end
will
make
him
a
much
more
important
part
of
the
team
next
year
brent
fedyk
was
the
leagues
biggest
improvement
over
last
years
point
total

consistency
became

him

this

as
universityfunded
sports
in

allowing

continue

did
anyone
else
see
this
game
last
night
just
like
a
playoff
game
lots
of
hittingbut
i
was
disappointed
by
the
video
goal
judge
on
all
replays
joe
murphys
goal
shouldnt
have
counted
it
didnt
go
in
net
and
according
to
the
tsn
broadcasters
the
video
goal
judge
said
that
he
saw
the
water
bottle
on
top
of
the
cage
move
so
he
assumed
the
puck
went
in
this
is
terriblehope
crap
like
this
doesnt
occur
in
the
playoffs
the
game
would
have
ended
in
tie
i
thought
the
red
light
went
onthus
in
the
review
the
presumption
would
be
to
find
conclusive
evidence
that
the
puck
did
not
go
in
the
netfrom
the
replays
i
say
even
from
the
rear
the
evidence
wasnt
conclusive
that
the
puck
was
in
or
outin
my
opinion
it
seemed
pretty
conclusive
to
me
the
puck
clearly
hit
the
crossbar
and
then
came
down
on
the
line
and
the
announcers
admittedly
homers
kept
harping
about
how
they
must
have
had
a
different
view
upstairs
because
it
was
obvious
to
them
and
i
would
have
thought
to
anyone
who
saw
the
replay
that
the
puck
didnt
go
in
the
referee
originally
signalled
no
goal
but
the
video
replay
judges
initiated
contact
with
the
referee
to
claim
that
a
goal
was
in
fact
scored
this
to
me
is
unheard
of
seeing
stuff
like
this
happen
gives
me
a
bad
feeling
about
the

should
what

here

he
should
have
said
that
he
hopes
fans
in

the

that
these

who

is
on
the

i
am
not
at
all
clear
about
what
you
are
trying
to
say
here
if
you

would
be
what
if
you
asked
this

if

played

the
naming
of

is
unnecessary
obfuscation

names
are
being
changed
for
another
reason
the
names
patrick
smythe
norris
adams
and
campbell
are
all
the
names
of
socalled
builders
of
the
game
this
is
the
same
type
of
thinking
that
put
stein
in
the
hall
of
fame
this
is
absolute
nonsense
the
real
builders
of
the
game
are
richard
morenz
howe
conacher
orr
etc
if
you
are
going
to
name
the
divisions
after
people
at
least
name
the
divisions
after
people
who
deserve
it
yes
these
people
deserve
recognigtion
as
hockey
greats
but
the
old
division
names
took
into
account
messers
patrick
norris
smythe
and
the
prince
who
had
alot
more
to
do
with
the
origins
of
the
league
than
people
who
came
into
an
already
established
situation
it
is
much
easier
to
be
an
element
of
change
hardly
the
established
situation
existed
prior
to
smythe
et
al
the
stanley
cup
was
a
challenge
trophy
up
for
grabs
to
whatever
team
could
successfully
mount
the
challenge
what
our
dear
founders
did
was
formalize
the
challenge
they
created
a
closed
league
an
oligop
olistic
professional
system
in
the
interests
of
making
money
wheth
er
or
not
that
system
has
contributed
to
better
hockey
is
certainly
debatable
we
are
however
stuck
with
their
invention
and
that
de
bate
is
academic
the
point
to
be
made
however
is
that
people
played
hockey
and
people
enjoyed
watching
hockey
long
before
smythe
and
his
pals
showed
up
or
a
standout
in
an
existing
situation
than
it
is
to
be
someone
who
creates
a
new
situation
if
you
want
to
honor
players
like
bobby
orr
than
im
sure
you
can
find
a
reason
to
name
a
torphy
after
him
such
as
best
offensive
defenseman
whats
wrong
with
best
defenceman
period
was
there
ever
a
better
defenceman
was
there
ever
a
better
player
and
if
you
think
that
bruce
norris
contribution
was
somehow
more
significant
than
bobby
orrs
then
in
the
interests
of
education
why
dont
you
take
a
poll
and
find
out
how
many
people
know
who
norris
was
but
you
dont
have
to
do
you
no
i
cant
for
the
reasons
i
gave
above
im
in
the
same
boat
as
jason
and
i
grew
up
with
the
current
divisonal
names
and
learned
them
when
i
was
about
years
old
and
who
played
in
what
division
if
a
year
old
american
can
learn
this
why
would
it
be
hard
for
an
occasional
fan
to
pick
up
on
who
plays
in
what
division
so
you
dont
feel
that
you
should
have
to
make
the
effort
to
remember
that
vancouver
plays
in
the
west
division
or
pacific
or
whatever
other
intuitively
understandable
moniker
is
chosen
oh
now
i
see
your
point
your
intention
has
been
to
alert
us
to
the
erosion
of
purity
ill
bet
you
like
hockey
because
its
for
the
most
part
played
by
whites
of
european
extraction
probably
not
in
my
case
im
sure
of
this
what
you
said
would
be
like
me
saying
that
all
maple
leafs
fans
are
as
biased
closed
minded
ignorant
and
of
course
you
neatly
deleted
jasons
jingoistic
rant
about
the
game
losing
its
canadianization
quoting
me
out
of
context
does
more
to
erode
your
credibility
than
it
does
mine
my
position
is
clearly
progressive
and
is
anything
but
biased
closed
minded
ig
norant
arrogant
i
will
grant
you
arrogant
and
moronic
as
you
just
because
someone
a
doesnt
like
what
mr
basketball
is
doing
b
voices
their
opinion
and
c
likes
the
senerio
of
you
going
to
antartica
does
not
mean
that
you
have
the
right
to
insult
them
nice
try
john
but
for
a

to

you

with

yes
its
a

that
the

lost
a
fine
team
in
one

the
best

markets
in

being
a

it
is
sad
to
see
all

get
thrown

oblivion
at

it
all
is
it
terribly
difficult
to
get
tickets
to
penguins
games
especially
now
that

dean

dmoneymagnusacsohiostateedu
here
is
my
traditional
experience
with
tickets
playoffs
and
otherwise
at
the
civic
arena
scalping
is
illegal
but
nonetheless
present
outside
the
arena
best
strategy
given
that
you
dont
mind
missing
the
anthem
which
is
ok
if
be
taylor
decides
to
come
back
ever
again
is
to
wait
until
or
when
the
game
is
rolling
the
scalpers
are
at
this
point
desperate
to
sell
and
will
reduce
to
near
or
at
face
value
to
get
rid
of

awarded
the

there
are

outside

you

you

buy

the

upi
mike
keenan
whose
nhl
coaching
history
has
been
to
wear
out
his
welcome
despite
an
impressive
penchant
for
winning
has
come
to
the
city
that
embraces
victors
above
all
else
well
i
could
become
a
fan
seriously
this
news
coming
since
thursday
has
effectively
robbed
the
islanders
and
the
devils
of
any
airtime
on
sports
talk
shows
almost
everywhere
that
ive
sampled
in
fact
the

almost
dont
exist
now
ranger
fans
calling

or

ones
midnight
sports
talk
were
in
a
mix
of
fury
over
this
season
and
near
orgasm
over
keenans
hiring
summarizing
keenan
is
a
winner
and
will
give
the
broadway
bums
da
business
in
pursuing
the
next
cup
chase
the
chicago
blackhawks
cut
their
last
tie
with
keenan
when
he
was
forced
out
as
general
manager
in
november
he
had
given
up
chicagos
coaching
duties
a
year
ago
and
his
thirst
for
the
power
of
a
gm
now
increases
the
pressure
on
beleaguered
rangers
gm
neil
smith
this
will
be
an
interesting
combination
to
watch
keenan
has
been
paid
enough
money
to
put
up
and
shut
up
and
just
be
a
coach
but
his
advice
on
any
player
moves
will
be
listened
to
closely
a
lot
of
big
player
moves
will
happen
remember
that
keenan
got
rid
of
denis
savard
the
country
club
days
are
over
when
keenan
left
chicago
i
couldnt
help
but
think
about
him
as
our
coach
smith
said
there
was
an
indication
he
would
be
taken
off
the
market
i
feared
that
and
couldnt
let
that
happen
if
paramount
had
given
smith
an
earlier
sign
of
support
and
offered
keenan
the
big
money
to
putupandshutup
back
in
january
the
rangers
might
not
be
heading
for
golf
now
keenan
takes
on
a
demoralized
team
that
offers
him
a
chance
to
fashion
yet
another
of
his
reclamation
projects
at
the
highest
salary
ever
commanded
by
an
nhl
coach
the
rangers
owned
by
gulf
western
have
bestowed
upon
keenan
an
unprecedented
million
fouryear
deal
ive
known
mike
a
long
time
messier
said
weve
won
two
canada
cups
together
hes
been
to
the
finals
three
times
maybe
we
miss
just
one
more
element
to
win
the
stanley
cup
i
dont
think
hes
the
same
person
he
was
years
ago
or
even
five
years
ago
i
think
he
has
changed
and
bettered
himself
with
experience
one
of
keenans
first
statements
was
a
reaffirmation
that
mark
messier
will
be
the
teams
captain
the
timing
of
the
move
gives
the
rangers
new
coach
months
to
prepare
for
the
nhl
draft
june
and
neil
smith
may
not
back
off
the
their
tradehappy
pattern
by
then
smith
might
have
some
bargains
on
keenans

al

however
you
spell

must
be
from

because
on

he

its
not
even

will
definatly
win
the

in

no
other
team
is

everyone
is
picking
chicago
i
dont

he
says
its
an

chicago
was
against

they
won
the

by

two
followed

who
is
also
a

it

even
if
they
do
they
arent

if
even
more
amazingly
they

they
would

story
i

concerned
mel

late
of

while
he
was
in

bobby
clarke
arguably
one
of
the
great
captains
of

was
bumped
up
to
the
status
of
playing
coach
and
so
he
had
to
relinquish
the
captaincy
bridgman
be
came
the
new
captain
a
reporter
asked
a
flyer
what
bridgman
did
as
a
captain
since
clarke
was
still
the
undisputed
leader
amongst
the
players
the
reporter
was
told
that
bridgman
was
in
charge
of
making

if

how

man
i
thought
people
in

are
good
with
hockey
i
might
not
be
great
in
math
but
tell
me
how
can
two
teams
ahve
the

with

record
manretard
cant
believe
people
actually
put
win

in

golly
i
love
stupid
people
listen
rex
this
is
hockey
the
nhl
to
be
precise
and
in
the
nhl
there
exist
these
things
called
ties
a
tie
occurs
when
a
game
ends
with
the
score
for
each
team
equal
each
team
gets
one
point
for
a
tie
there
also
exits
these
things
called
wins
a
win
is
when
one
team
has
a
higher
score
than
the
opponent
oh
yeah
only
two
teams
play
each
other
at
a
time
so
i
can
say
the
opponent
a
team
gets
two
points
for
a
win
so
lets
say
that
a
team
has
a
record
of
wins
losses
and
ties
another
team
has
a
record
of
wins
losses
and
ties
the
first
team
has
points
the
second
team
has
points
wow
they
both
have
the
same
number
of
points
but
the
number
of
wins
is
different
how
did
they
do
that
thats
amazing
so
rex
when
people
talk
about
wins
being
the
first
tiebreaker
well
then
thats
what
it
means
in
our
example
the
second
team
would
win
the
tiebreaker
and
therefore
have
the
better
record
even
though
both
teams
had
the

if

didnt

people
would

why
would
they

if

the

would
it

as
the

suggests
the

were
not
impressive
this
afternoon
dropping
a
decision
to
the
la

most
of
the
flames
neglected
to
show
up
especially
in
their
own
zone
as
the
kings
hit
at
least
five
posts
the
flames
best
line
was
probably
skrudlandpaslawskiberube
which
tells
how
bad
the
flames
were
gary
suter
scored
a
great
goal
in
fact
all
three
flame
goals
were
scored
by
dmen
yawney
and
dahlquist
getting
the
others
but
also
made
some
bonehead
plays
for
the
kings
pat
conacher
was
especially
impressive
the
games
was
very
chippy
as
dan
mirouelli
lost
control
early
and
never
recovered
it
there
were
highsticks
crosschecks
punches
hits
from

fleury
got
a
game
misconduct
for
rubbing
out
warren
rychel
from
behind
flames
dominated
the
game
physically
but
failed
to
take
advantage
due
to
horrendous
defensive
lapses
i
dont
think
vernon
can
be
blamed
for
any
of
the
goals
calgary
went
with
dmen
as
roger
johansson
played
lw
he
looked

imho
i
hope
king

chris

gretzky
left

no

ron

to
him
the
hot

at
the

stadium
are
the
best
food
in
all
the
arenas
in
the
nhl
from
there
don
commented
on
the
quebecmontreal
game
the
game
had
great
flow
because
referee
paul
stewart
calls
the
best
game
in
the
nhl
in
contrast
the
calgaryla
game
was
terrible
all
stopandgo
over
minutes
of
penalties
called
against
calgary
by
dan
marouelli
its
getting
so
that
the
ref
who
calls
the
most
penalties
gets
to
ref
in
the
finals
next
ron
showed
an

ron

several
key
injuries

don

the

the

main
purpose
on
a

to
prevent
goals
from
being
scored
not
to
score
them
when
lemieux

gilmour
play
their
number
one
purpose
is
to
score
defence
is
secondary
especially
considering
the
line
that
plays
against
them
is
probably
a
defensive
one
that
is
why
they
are
not
selke
candidates
gainey
is
the
best
defensive
forward
ever
i
stand
by
that
assessment
he
was
a
very
good
player
who
belongs
in
the
hall
of
fame
did
you
ever
watch
him
play
he
never
made
a
technical
error
i
watched
him
over
his
entire
career
i
have
never
seen
a

and
that
includes
russell
courtnall
and
davie

screw
up
as
many
breakaways
as

i
will
never

a
higher
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
despite
last
nights
shutout
he
doesnt
have
what
it
takes
last
night
was
due
to
an
inept
ranger
team
much
more
than
roussels
skill
a
on
and
they
dont
get
a
shot
away
a
on
none
and
one
guy
just
passes
and
stops
the
other
guy
shoots
into
roussels
pad
cmon
pete
so
the
rangers
were
inept
a
shutout
is
a
shutout
during
both
of
soderstroms
masterpieces
against
toronto
mike
emerich
was
quoted
as
saying
he
didnt
think
the
leafs
had
much
offensive
firepower
past
their
first
line
does
that
make
soderstroms
shutouts
less
impressive
because
of
torontos
lack
of
offense
yes
it
does
absolutely
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
of
course
at
the
end
of
the
season
points
is
points
no
matter
how
you
get
them
and
on
the
score
sheets
shutouts
are
shutouts
but
if
youre
a
coach
deciding
between
two
goalies
or
a
gm
looking
to
make
a
trade
you
have
got
to
look
deeper
than
the
stat
sheets
i
didnt
see
the
second
toronto
game
but
the
first
one
was
a
defensive
masterpiece
there
was
nothing
in
that
game
to
judge
tommy
soderstrom
on
because
he
wasnt
tested
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
scoring
chances
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
you
have
very
little
to
go
by
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
habs
you
saw
a
goalie
stand
on
his
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
was
a
goalie
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
well
if
you
look
back
to
november
when
roussel
was
the
goalie
soderstrom
was
being
treated
for
his
heart
ailment
the
flyers
finished
november
at
and
were
overall
and
theres
no
way
of
knowing
where
the
flyers
would
have
finished
if
soderstom
wasnt
wearing
the
oragne
n
black
im
glad
we
dont
have
to
find
out
anytime
soon
either
because
he
is
one
hell
of
a
player
i
would
take
him
over
roussel
right
now
but
i
still
think
dom
has
what
it
takes
to
be
the
guy
he
outperformed
hextall
enough
during
the
season
to
make
flyers
management
think
that
way
too
dont
be
so
sure
of
that
flyers
management
never
says
bad
thing
about
roussel
but
they
dont
say
too
much
on
the
good
side
either
ive
seen
at
least
two
interviews
where
every
time
farwell
was
asked
how
happy
he
was
to
have
two
good
goaltenders
it
was
tommy
this
tommy
that
and
oh
yeah
dom
has
played
well
too

the

what
was

final

on

night

picture
by
any

flyers
in
the

hall
of

kinda
dull
really
they
handed
out
a
team
picture
to
everybody
who
walked
in
from
pizza
hut
but
it
was
the
same
picture
they
sold
in
the
programs
in
midseason
had
names
like
benning
kasper
and
how
did
the
flyers
choose
the
fans
who
received
the
shirts
off
our
backs
winning
recchis
jersey
after
breaking
the
clubs
single
season
point
record
would
have
been
nice
but
knowing
your
luck
you
would
have
won
roussels
mostly
random
seat
locations
some
were
given
out
by
having
certain
autographs
on
the
team
photos
i
dont
like
that
method
since
ive
seen
guards
help
out
people
get
things
like

surely
if

he

maybe
if

off

for
you
youd
only
be

your

of

but
to
each
his

roger
im
not
sure
here
but
i
think
ignorance
is
really
a
function
of
a
lack
of
knowledge
and
not
formulating
an
opinionbut
hey
if
you
need
to
take
a
cheap
shot
then
by
all
means
go
aheadthats
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
i
think
gainey
would
be
honoured
to
know
that
youve
included
him
i
think
gainey
should
feel
honoured
to
know
that
he
is
remembered
at
all
my
word
such
vehemence
against
poor
ol
bob
gainey
why
does
he
bother
you
so
muchhe
was
an
effective
player
for
his
style
of
play
on
this
list
i
also
think
you
have
a
relatively
naive
view
about
what
wins
a
hockey
gamepluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
certainly
pluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
any
team
and
that
is
simply
because
there
are
not
enough
solid
twoway
players
to
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your
checking
centre
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvis
for
that
matter
i
would
take
either
gretzky
or
mario
as
my
checking
centres
do
you
think
gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
im
really
sorry
roger
but
you
have
lost
me
completely
here
why
dont
you
ask
me
if
i
would
rather
have
jesus
christ
himself
in
nets
now
if
you
were
to
compare
say
for
example
bob
gainey
with
guy
carbonneau
you
would
have
a
balanced
comparison
any
team
the
selke
is
designed
to
acknowledge
their
contributioni
think
that
most
people
understand
that
its
not
the
nobel
prizeso
settle
down
youre
wrong
again
the
selke
is
awarded
to
the
forward
that
does
the
best
job
defensively
and
this
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
plugger
if
gilmour
does
the
best
defensive
job
in
the
league
i
dont
see
why
he
should
be
out
of
the
running
simply
because
he
also
contributes
offensively
im
wrong
againhmmm
lets
seewhere
was
i
wrong
in
the
first
place
im
only
guessing
here
rog
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
youve
setup
a
youre
wrong
again
macro
key
on
your
machine
i
agree
that
my
use
of
the
word
plugger
is
simplisticbut
i
think
you
know
what
im
getting
at
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
gilmours
potential
as
a
selkewinner
was
never
part
of
the
debateare
you
asking
me
for
an
opinion
if
so
i
think
there
are
far
too
many
other
deserving
players
to
include
gilmour
among
the
candidates
settle
down
if
you
think
that
i
have
likened
the
selke
to
the
nobel
prize
then
i
suggest
that
you
had
best
settle
down
and
if
you
are
going
to
try
to
put
words
in
my
mouth
let
me
suggest
that
you
settle
down
before
you
bother
following
up

i
would

your

hated
lafleur
until
i
realized
that
he
was
likely
the
most
aesthetically
pleasing
player
to
ever
skate
in
my
lifetime
why
would
anyone
talk
about
gainey
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your
checking
centre
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvis
for
that
matter
i
would
take
either
gretzky
or
mario
as
my
checking
centres
do
you
think
gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
im
really
sorry
roger
but
you
have
lost
me
completely
here
why
dont
you
ask
me
if
i
would
rather
have
jesus
christ
himself
in
nets
did
he
play
hockey
at
a
high
level
was
he
any
good
if
not
why
would
you
bother
to
bring
jc
up
i
am
talking
about
hockey
players
here
if
you
cant
follow
the
conversation
dont
follow
up
as
i
said
previously
it
is
not
my
responsibility
to
educate
you
now
if
you
were
to
compare
say
for
example
bob
gainey
with
guy
carbonneau
you
would
have
a
balanced
comparison
sure
two
journeymen
big
deal
neither
one
of
them
is
worth
discussing
im

lets
seewhere
was
i
wrong
in
the
i
would
take
fuhr
and
sanderson
off
of
the

first
place
im

but
i
have
a
feeling
that
youve
setup

is

then
i
will

to

hey

your

statement

poor
ol
bob
gainey
why
does
he
bother
you
so
muchhe
was
an

player
for
his

of

he
was
just
another
player
to
laud
him
as
anything
more

you
sound

this

dont

that

huge
sweeping

frankly
you
have
a
very
unconvincing
style
im
not
defending
bob
gaineyfrankly
i
dont
care
for
him
all
that
much
but
your
dismissal
of
him
as
something
less
than
an

player
is
tiresomeit
has
no
basis
in
anything
how
many
calders
did

win

refresh

what
about

was

a

yeah
not
the

of
a

superstar
i
know

try

any

sharks
review
part
goaltenders
as
the
sharks
season
came
to
a
close
tonight
i
will
start
a
series
of
posts
trying
to
revisit
the
players
the
trades
the
moves
etc
that
went
through
for
the
sharks
for
the
past
season
if
you
are
uninterested
since
i
will
have
the
words
sharks
review
in
the
subject
heading
in
these
postings
you
can
kill
them
i
will
first
try
to
evaluate
how
the
players
did
these
ratings
of
course
are
subject
to
my
own
biases
but
i
hope
that
i
can
try
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
i
will
evalute
players
who
finished
the
season
with
the
sharks
andor
did
not
play
for
another
nhl
team
this
season
thus
then
lets
go
to
the
goaltenders
brian
hayward
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
p
d
it
is
sad
that
his
career
has
to
come
to
this
dim
an
end
a
career
that
featured
sharing
three
jennings
trophies
with
patrick
roy
in
and
it
would
indeed
be
unfair
for
me
to
do
anything
but
give
him
a
passing
grade
and
skip
the
letter
grading
but
he
had
simply
been
awful
on
ice
this
year
save
for
a
bright
spot
or
two
and
even
if
he
had
been
healthy
he
would
not
be
any
more
than
the
goalie
but
hayward
was
a
classy
individual
who
also
figured
in
on
the
sharks
first
ever
victory
the
game
of
the
season
last
year
against
the
calgary
flames
as
he
retires
the
fans
will
remember
what
a
good
guy
he
was
jeff
hackett
season
acquired
from
n
y
islanders
in
expansion
draft
grade
c
hackett
after
deservedly
winning
the
team
mvp
honors
last
season
simply
wasted
the
year
other
than
a
few
good
spots
saves
against
los
angeles
almostshutout
against
tampa
bay
etc
hackett
finishing
with
save
percentage
and
a
gaa
watched
his
status
go
from
the
teams
goalie
to
bench
decoration
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
was
expected
early
to
carry
the
team
along
instead
he
apparently
became
frustrated
but
the
an
early
injury
that
forced
him
to
miss
games
may
have
been
a
contributing
factor
but
upon
return
he
simply
wasnt
up
to
the
task
he
may
not
return
next
year
wade
flaherty
season
still
eligible
as
rookie
acquired
signed
as
undrafted
free
agent
grade
i
a
it
is
pretty
hard
to
evaluate
a
goaltender
on
just
one
game
alone
thus
the
incomplete
grade
but
yet
in
the
one
start
that
he
did
get
against
the
calgary
flames
flaherty
was
nothing
but
sharp
for
at
least
two
periods
he
started
the
season
poorly
in
kansas
city
but
finished
strong
prompting
the
blades
owner
ron
parker
to
comment
that
he
should
be
a
candidate
for
the
ihl
mvp
honors
the
upcoming
ihl
playoffs
would
be
a
major
challenge
for
him
as
he
tries
to
make
it
into
the
nhl
last
year
he
was
a
capable
backup
for
arturs
irbe
in
the
throughout
the
season
and
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
picking
up
allstar
honors
along
with
irbe
now
its
time
for
him
to
show
that
he
can
share
the
job
with
irbe
next
year
because
with
prospects
dan
ryder
trevor
robins
and
scott
cashman
coming
along
if
he
doesnt
make
it
next
year
he
may
not
ever
arturs
irbe
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
b
i
may
yet
be
overly
critical
of
irbe
in
a
year
that
he
clearly
established
that
hes
a
bona
fide
nhl
goaltender
perhaps
a
bona
fide
goaltender
he
has
provided
most
of
the
little
highlight
footage
that
the
sharks
team
had
getting
the
teams
first
ever
shutout
against
the
los
angeles
kings
on
december
he
has
been
fearless
in
and
out
of
the
net
aggressively
playing
the
puck
and
making
passes
reminding
people
of
a
young
ron
hextall
except
of
course
the
goonism
yet
he
still
needs
to
develop
more
consistency
which
is
hard
to
do
with
such
a
bad
defense
in
front
of
him
but
if
the
sharks
are
to
challenge
for
a
playoff
spot

with

then
during

pressure
sweden
turned

around
in
mikael

worked
hard
behind
the
finnish
goal
and
passed
the
puck
to
jan

in
front
who
backhanded
the
puck
low
rundqvist
entered
the
finnish
zone
and
passed
to
ahlund
and
the
finnish
defense
let
ahlund
skate
in
and
take
a
shot
that
ketterer
dropped
into
the
goal
next
roger
hansson
behind
the
goal
sent
the
puck
back
to
the
blue
line
where
roger
akerstrom
took
a
slap
shot
and
ketterer
didnt
see
the
puck
since
there
was
traffic
in

third
period
started
with
a
nice
goal
by
stefan
the
shadow
nilsson
stefan
and
patrik
juhlin
entered
the
finnish
zone
patrik
passed
the
puck
back
to
stefan
who
alone
with
ketterer
made
no
mistake
then
keijo
sailynoja
show
started
he
reduce
and
equalized
the
lead
in
only
seconds
first
he
scored
the
goal
and
after
that
he
came
in
alone
with
aslin
but
was
tripped
by
aslin
to
get
a
penalty
shot
sailynoja
made
a
nice
penalty
shot
showed
forehand
and
put
in
with
a
low
backhand
shot
the
swedes
seemed
to
head
for
a
win
when
mikael
renberg
scored
the
goal
late
in
the
game
on
a
nice
power
play
combination
renberg
waited
in
the
slot
showed
that
he
wanted
the
puck
on
the
backhand
side
ahlund
passed
the
puck
and
renberg
took
a
turnaround
shot
low
in
ketterers
goals
far
side
but
jari
korpisalo
had
other
plans
as
he
only
seconds
later
scored
the
games
final
goal
to
make
it
korpisalo
took
a
slap
shot
from
a
narrow
angle
that
maybe
aslin
should
have
saved
all
in
all
a
decent
game
where
the
defense
wasnt
the
best
both
teams
juggled
around
the
lines
a
bit
in
the
second
and
third
period
to
try
no
combinations
renberg
and
rundqvist
plays
well
together
in
the

what
if

this

with

the

they
rather
see
their

out

most
of
the

or
even
relegated
than

its
not

difficult
to

its
just
like
here
in

you
grow
up
being
either
a
jokerit

hifk
fan
the

team
is
the

team
in

you

helsingfors
ifk
have

only
started
taking

seriously
in

so
i
think
youre
exagerating
here
however
its
been
proved
that
both
fan
groups
can
cheer
the
same
team
thats
the
finnish
national
team
maybe
thats
how
you
could
set
up
a
huge
franchise
in
finland
no
one
has
ever
said
that
the
team
must
be
called
after
one
city
or
play
all
its
games
on
one
arena
just
one
team
finland
and
team
sweden
in
the
nhl
just
wouldnt
make
any
sense
we
have
way
more
talent
than
of
the
total
of
north
american
talent
after
a
couple
of
seasons
you
would
never
see
the
cup
going
anywhere
outside
the
nordic
presuming
that
our
teams
would
have
the
advantage
in
drafting
local
talent
as
prooposed
thats
a
rather
bold
claim
in
the
light
of
how
successful
the
canadian
american
olympic
teams
have
been
and
theyve
had
to
play
according
to
our
set
of
rules
and
on
international
ice
the
olympic
teams
contained
about
as
much
talent
as
your
average
expansion
team
canada
had
eric
lindros
sean
burke
joe
juneau
and
chris
kontos
another
four

five
have

while
robb
stauber
has
done
well
for
the
kings
in
goal
nothing
more
in
fact
im
sure
that
an
allstar
team
assembled
from
the
best
finnish
league
teams
would
do
no
better
in
the
nhl
than
hartford
or

bay
currently
are
doing
but
what
happens
if
all
topclass
finnish
swedish
players
gradually
end
up

stockholm
as
the

ones
gradually

no

pittsburgh

but
i
have
my
doubts
about
the
homebased
finnish
players
the
national
team
did
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championships
largely
due
to
the
efforts
of
markus
ketterer
the
goalie
or
the
players
listed
above
and
luck
theres
presumably
a
lot
of
decent
players
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstars
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuable
role
players
however
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
sweden
is
easier
to
judge
because
they
have
more
players
in
north
america
their
points
total
players
is
seven
more
than
ottawas
top
players
combined
if
we
estimate
there
are
six
more
nhl
regulars
back
home
in
sweden
an
allswedish
team
would
assemble
about
skill
points
deducting
some
points
from
pittsburgh
ny
rangers
and
other
teams
that
rely
on
swedish
players
the
swedish
team
would
finish
in
sixth
place
about
as
high
as
boston
vancouver
calgary
and
montreal
on
paper
so
the
dynasty
talk
isnt
completely
unfounded
here
an
allfinnishallswedish
team
might
have
an
advantage
because
the
players
would
be
playing
at
home
half
of
the
time
wont
have
to
adapt
to
a
foreign
country
and
a
foreign
language
and
presumably
play
the
wideopen
european
variant
of
hockey
rather
than
have
to
learn
the
north
american
checking
game
however
if
free
agency
becomes
a
factor
the
top
scandinavian
players
still
might
end
up
playing
for
largemarket
teams
after
a
couple
of
years
the
same
way
edmontons
dynasty
crumbled
in
the
late
some
fringe
players
likely
will
be
drafted
by

nhl
teams
as
having
an
exclusive

pool
might
be
a

after

id
settle

prohibit
all

from

allow

i
saw
yesterday
on

a

between
team
sweden
and

finland
most
of
us
might
know
that
it
was
played
in

and
the
result
was
for
the

team
thats
nothing
very

i
was
very
surprised
of
saku
koivu
i
must
admit
that
he
surprised
me
already
in
the
finnish
playoffs
and
now
on
team
finland
saku
koivu
is
a
light
weight
player
if
we
consider
his
size
according
to
my
stats
he
is
only
and
and
he
is
only
but
he
is
a
real
twoway
player
skates
well
can
score
gives
nice
passes
does
even
bodycheckings
he
is
really
something
to
watch
in
the
wc
the
size
isnt
always
everything
maybe
we
remember
harlamov
and
they
say
that
saku
is
still
growing
up
during
last
year

however
that
aside
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
changing
the
names
based
on
the
reasons
given
for
it
making
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
unique
divisional
names
based
on
individuals
who
do
deserve
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
unique
touch
that
differs
from
other
sports
in
addition
i
do
not
think
that
changing
divisional
names
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
people
that
are
interested
in
hockey
so
its
a
pointless
exercise
anyway
there
are
several
problems
with
the
way
the
game
is
being
presented
to
the
fans
i
feel
that
geographical
names
would
enhance
regional
loyalties
more
than
names
honouring
personages
and
of
course
they
would
not
appear
nearly
as
confusing
to
one
approaching
the
sport
for
the
first
time
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
points
system
percentages
as
used
in
the
other
major
sports
are
clearly
more
informative
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
standings
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calculation
to
account
for
games
in
hand
which
is
almost
always
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentages
claiming
perhaps
that
it
is
an
americanization
of
the
sport
but
i
feel
that
using
percentages
is
more
informative
and
whether
it
is
american
or
not
is
irrelevant
if
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
then
that
is
a
separate
issue
not
central
to
the
original
article
something
to
consider
additionally
is
whether
or
not
players
like
orr
who
contributed
to
the
glory
of
the
sport
would
have
been
able
to
do
so
without
an
organized
professional
league
to
play
in
in
this
case
honouring
builders
of
the
league
as
opposed
to
builders
of
the
sport
becomes
a
chickenandegg
type
question
although
it
was
the
chicken
even
if
orr
couldnt
have
contributed
without
the
likes
of
norris
you
would
have
to
agree
that
norris
couldnt
have
contributed
without
the
likes
of
orr
and
taking
a
poll
of
most
fans
would
quickly
tell
you
who
the
fans
feel
made
the
more
meaningful
contribution
exactly
true
naming
divisions
and
trophies
after
smythe
and
the
bunch
is
the
same
kind
of
nepotism
that
put
stein
in

of

i
have
always
thought
that
this
was
nonsense
dunno
if
the
stein
comparison
is
justifiable
since
it
doesnt
look
as
though
his
unanimous
acceptance
to

will
hold
up
it
doesnt

after
reading
some
of
the
reports
of
possible
nhl
moves
to
milwaukee
or
that
milwaukee
should
have
an
nhl
team
i
thought
id
pass
along
a
story
i
heard
recently
this
is
second
hand
so
i
dont
know
how
true
it
is
but
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
either
bradley
center
in
milwaukee
is
home
to
the
milwaukee
admirals
minor
leauge
hockey
team
the
owner
of
the
admirals
sorry
i
cant
remember
his
name
either
owns
or
at
least
shelled
out
the
majority
of
the
funds
to
build
the
bradley
center
lloyd
pettit
supposedly
he
was
approached
by
the
nhl
about
an
expansion
franchise
but
turned
it
down
because
he
thought
the
franchise
fee
of
million
was
too
high
like
i
said
i
dont
know
whether
this
story
is
true
or
just
a
rumor
but
if
its
true
dont
look
for
an
nhl
team
in
milwaukee
anytime
soon
the
admirals
arent
going
to
be
forced
out
of
the
building
and
you
wont
see
an
nhl
club
and
a
minor
league
club
in
the
same
building
especially
since
the
nbas
milwaukee
bucks
play
there
as
well
yes
it
is
true
that
he
refused
to
buy
a
franchise
from
the
nhl
for
but
at
the
time
the
reason
was
that
the
established
market
for
teams
was
much
less
than
that
he
felt
that
no
one
would
pay
for
an
expansion
team
and
that
he
would
simply
wait
to
buy
an
existing
franchise
for
less
than
that
but
the
market
fooled
him
and
teams
have
been
created
for
apiece
in
the
last
three
years
and
even
the
existing
teams
cant
be
moved
for
less
than
and
i
doubt
that
he
could
get
one
for
that
little
pettit

lost

you
obviously
dont

how
tv
scheduling
works
espn
had
prior
contracts
to
baseball
to
show
monday
night
games
and
had
contracted
all
the
other
bs
shows
well
in
advance
the
nhl
tv
deal
was
very
late
in
the
scheduling
process
you
normally
have
to
do
this
oneplus
year
out
the
nhl
package
was
finished
two
weeks
before
the
season
started
espn
has
shown
tremendous
commitment
to
the
nhl
by
squeezing
in
extra
telecasts
when
it
could
like
the
last
minnesota
game
and
putting
stanley
cup
games
as
backup
to
their
baseball
telecasts
which
by
favorable
circumstances
they
could
pull
off
last
night
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
espn
cannot
break
contracts
at
will
they
must
honor
the
previous
deals
they
made
does
have
something
to
do
with
it

if
you
risk
a

cut
towards
the

as

he
passed
the

skrudland
went

for
slashing
and

crazy
as
he
went
after
shuchuk
stern
wound
up
with
a
double
minor
for
roughing
a
single
minor
for
cross
checking
and
a
minute
misconduct
and
he
took
the
flames
right
out
of
the
game
on
the
plus
side
the
kings
for
the
most
part
played
very
disciplined
hockey
as
they
let
calgary
retaliate
the
kings
played
good
team
defense
and
excellent
penalty
killing
on
the
minus
side
the
kings
lost
almost
every
faceoff
this
must

a

murray
can

hes

some

without
giving
up
anything
the

needed

any

prospects
all
of
this
in
three
years
has
anyone
done
better
the
year
before
he
took
over
the
wings
didnt
even
make
the
playoffs
there
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
during
demers
stint
that
the
wings
did
ok
but
that
was
due
to
demers
motavational
skills
and
clutch
and
grab
style
they
didnt
have
much
talent
gerald
murray
wasnt
responsible
for
primeau
although
im
not
ready
to
admit
thats
a
horrible
pick
they
hired
him
after
the
draft
which
has
never
made
sense
to
me
his
first
pick
was
lapointe
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next

a
new
set

to

im
getting

they
are
a
pretty
good
team
that
is
contending
for
the
stanley
cup
but
looks
unlikely
to
win
it
a
truly
great
gm
would
have
been
able
to
make
the
moves
to
push
the
team
to
the
upper
echelon
of
the
nhl
and
maybe
win
the
stanley
cup
a
good
gm
like
murray
can
maintain
the
teams
success
but
cant
push
them
to
the
next
level
when
jacques
demers
brought
the
wings
to
the
conference
finals
twice
a
few
years
back
he
had
everyone
on
the
team
giving
percent
but
he
had
very
little
talent
he
had
yzerman
bob
probert
who
had
drinking
problems
at
the
time
and
a
couple
of
decent
goaltenders
in
hanlon
and
stefan
who
got
hot
thats
about
it
can
you
name
one
player
on
those
earlier
teams
who
even
deserved
to
be
in
the
allstar
game
much
less
actually
got
there
other
than
yzerman
and
probert
like
petr
klima
give
me
a
break
when
they
faced
edmonton
in
both
of
those
conference
finals
as
hard
as
they
played
it
was
clear
they
faced
a
team
that
simply
had
superior
talent
to
the
wings
thats
why
they
could
not
get
to
the
finals
also
at
that
time
the
norris
division
was
still
the
weakest
division
in
hockey
and
getting
past
chicago
and
toronto
was
not
as
impressive
as
it
is
today
murray
has
brought
scoring
talent
to
the
wings
that
they
did
not
have
a
few
years
ago
when
devellano
was
gm
and
demers
was
coach
to
name
a
few
ysebaert
kozlov
and
paul
coffey
who
has
made
a
definite
positive
impact
on
the
power
play
especially
murray
has
built
one
of
the
most
talented
teams
in
hockey
at
the
present
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
pittsburgh
penguins
the
wings
have
at
least
five
goal
scorers
that
i
can
think
of
and
a
couple
of
defenseman
with
over
games
worth
of
playoff
experience
murrays
one
failing
is
that
unlike
the
other
gms
you
mentioned
who
are
definitely
also
good
dont
get
me
wrong
he
has
not
found
for
himself
a
strong
coach
to
motivate
the
team
to
go
out
and
give
percent
for
the
full
minutes
every
night
like
they
did
the
last
time
they
made
a
cup
run
when
a
team
wins
or
loses
its
a
reflection
of
the
gm
and
the
coach
which
was
the
point
of
my
original
post
if
the
team
outmatches
their
opponent
in
terms
of
talent
but
loses
anyway
which
has
been
the
case
this
year
when
the
wings
have
struggled
that
indicates
that
the
gm
has
done
his
job
in
building
up
the
team
but
the
coach
has
failed
to
motivate
them
if
as
in
the
case
of
the
last
run
the
wings
made
in
the
playoffs
before
murray
came
they
gave
opponents
a
hard
time
who
should
have
beaten
them
easily
that
indicates
good
coaching
making
up
for
a
lack
of
talent
all
of
this
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
was
a
bad
gm
i
merely
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contender
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
as
great
as
you
claim
the
wings
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probably
more
than
once
if
he
was
as
great
a
gm
as
you
claim
and
he
was
as
poor
a
coach
as
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intelligent
enough
to
hire
the
coach
to
push
the
team
to
the
next
level
of
success
but
murray
is
an
average
unspectacular
nhl
coach
and
a
pretty
good
gm
so
none
of
this
is
true
anyway

nobody

just
wanted
to

a
little

know
what
you
mean
i
glow
everytime
ronnies
out
on

in
fact
one
of
the
neatest
things
about
seeing
the
pens
in
person
is
that
i
can
key
in
on
him
instead
of
watching
what
id
probably
be
seeing
on
tv
he
does
so
many
subtle
things
behind
the
play
he
said
in
an
interview
recently
that
when
he
was
a
kid
his
dad
stressed
the
importance
of
playing
twoway
hockey
that
you
have
to
learn
how
to
play
defense
as
well
as
offense
and
he
obviously
took
that
advice
to
heart
he
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
when
he
arrived
in
pittsburgh
to
the
team
whose
forwards
for
the
most
part
couldnt
and
wouldnt
play
a
lick
of
defense
its
really
difficult
to
assess
what
the
key
trades
were
that
brought
all
of
this
success
to
the
pens
you
mention
rick
tocchet
and
he
has
certainly
helped
and
even
ol
kjell
has
been
steady
but
looking
at
this
team
you
could
almost
take
any
one
of
them
out
of
the
lineup
permanently
and
replace
them
with
an
extremely
mediocre
player
and
it
wouldnt
matter
if
i
had
to
pick
the
top
three
acquisitions
in
recent
years
they
would
be
tom
barrasso
ron
francis
larry
murphy
id
love
to
put

but
i
do
think
the
only
thing
that

claimed

disliked

for
a
variety
of
reasons
roger
on
one
front
you
flamed
him
rather
severely
on
the
grounds
that
his
was
a
jingoistic
rant
but
you
also
supported
the
namechanging
on
the
grounds
that
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
because
of
the
individuals
they
represent
fwiw
i
do
not
think
the
flaming
was
warranted
nor
do
i
think
you
enhanced
what
credibility
you
have
with
it
at
all
just
an
observation
however
that
aside
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
changing
the
names
based
on
the
reasons
given
for
it
making
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
unique
divisional
names
based
on
individuals
who
do
deserve
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
unique
touch
that
differs
from
other
sports
in
addition
i
do
not
think
that
changing
divisional
names
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
people
that
are
interested
in
hockey
so
its
a
pointless
exercise
anyway
if
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
then
that
is
a
separate
issue
not
central
to
the
original
article
something
to
consider
additionally
is
whether
or
not
players
like
orr
who
contributed
to
the
glory
of
the
sport
would
have
been
able
to
do
so
without
an

in
in

honouring

unfortunately
the

then
disappeared
the

way
getting
just
more

generally
looked
lethargic

skills

he

lbs

throw
himself
around

not

successful
yet
he
also
still
needs

work

he
improved

the
season

was
actually
quite

bruce
was
bothered
virtually
all

with
a
groin
injury
which
kept
him
out
of
the
lineup
for
all

games
this

it
is
difficult
to
speculate
how
well
he
would
have
done
this

had
he
not

the
injury
but
the
bruce
was
effective
with
a
man
up
or
a
man
short
in
the
sharks

season
and
was
expected
to
be
a
strong
offensive
leader
this

as
well
the
injury
appears
serious
which
is
a
shame
because
otherwise
he
may

pederson

dave
snuggerud
grade

b
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
the
flyers
decision
to
unload
pederson
after
a
very
good
offensive
season
last
season
points
in
games
but
after
riding
the
pine
early
in
the
season
pederson
was
summarily
sent
to
the
sharks
in
exchange
of
the
defensiveminded
snuggerud
and
he
finished
with
games
combined
with
the
flyers
and
the
sharks
he
was
also
limited
by
injuries
this
season
and
this
limited
his
production
points
but
when
healthy
pederson
appears
impressive
with
a
good
scoring
touch
good
size
and
the
willingness
to
throw
it
around
although
hes
not
considered
a
physical
forward
and
good
speed
he
also
does
not
appear
to
be
a
liability
on
defense
but
the
sharks
probably
have
to
wait
until
next
season
to
see
how
much
exactly
pederson
can
do
john
carter
season
acquired
free
agent
from
boston
grade
i
bb
carter
was
definitely
one
of
the
hardest
workers
on
the
team
and
the
hard
work
worked
wonders
as
at
times
he
looked
great
on
ice
however
although
he
did
look
great
at
times
the
fact
that
he
received
just
points
in
games
for
his
efforts
is
a
sign
that
there
is
only
so
much
his
hard
work
can
do
and
the
sharks
confirmed
that
by
sending
him
to
kansas
city
with
about
games
left
in
the
season
carter
who
will
turn
on
may
always
hussled
but
as
a
result
was
sometimes
trapped
too
deep
within
the
offensive
zone
while
forechecking
but
he
was
generally
a
credit
on
the
defensive
end
but
he
is
probably
of
limited
utility
in
that
capacity
and
he
did
not
impress
offensively
although
he
was
one
of
the
best
sharks
at
drawing
penalties
he
is
very
unlikely
to
be
back
next
season
jeanfrancois
quintin

i
dont

let
quintin
play
any
more
than
the
games
he
played
this
season
he
was
generally
hardworking
and
creating
opportunities
offensively
and
appeared
at
age
ready
for
regular
nhl
duty
at

for
a

in
those

two
to

games

beaufait
got
a

coffey

the

knocked
down
a
playoff
spot
and
the

decimated
with
injuries
playing
games
and
scoring
a
goal
for
his
only
nhl
point
thus
far
despite
small
size
lbs
beaufait
was
not
shy
to
throw
himself
around
when
necessary
and
looked
pretty
good
at
times

its
too
early
to
judge
him

normal
position
when
he
was
up
for
his
cup
of
tea
games
midway
through
the
season
he
was
generally
very
much
of
a
defensive
liability
and
did
not
show
much
offensively
either
although
that
may
be
more
indicative
of
the
lack
of
ice
time
he
got
in
those
games
he
may
need
another
season
to
work
on
his
defense
but
once
his
defense
is
acceptable
he
should
be

the

to
be
close
to
being
out

chances

some
reason
after
being

failing
to

the

scoring
goals
for

points
and
he
spent
most
of
the
rest
of
the
way
in
kansas
city
he
was
not
particularly
strong
defensively
and
despite
his
offensive
brilliance
in
the
minors
he
has
failed
thus
far
to
score

you
that

zettler
gave
the

every

hes
got
this

unfortunately
this
still
wasnt
enough
to
make
him
any
more
than
a
marginal
nhler
if
that
he
works
hard
for
sure
but
is
no
better
than
average
on
defense
and
is
prone
to
costly
penalties
and
defensive
lapses
at
times
while
being
basically
an
offensive
zero

in

would

david
williams
season
acquired
free

cc
imo
williams
was
the
most
valuable
defenseman
for
the
sharks
in
playing
a
combination
of
good
offense
goals
and
assists
in
games
and
good
defense
but
he
playing
the
first
part
of
this
season
in
kansas
city
was
good
neither
offensively
nor
defensively
this
year
it
then
appears
that
was
a
fluke
although
he
improved
towards
the
end
of
the
season
he
was
prone
to
being
out
of
position
defensively
and
did
not
demonstrate
the
playmaking
skills
that
made
him
the
teams
leading
scorer
among
defensemen
last
year
he
would
also
be
hardpressed

jayson

draft
grade
b
after
being
touted
as
the

top
defensive
prospects
in
training
camp
before
more
had
a
rather
disappointing
as
he
was
not
particularly
good
defensively
and
had
just
points
in
games
he
then
proceeded
to
improve
his
game
massively
this
season
becoming
the
teams
most
reliable
defenseman
whom
the
team
can
count
on
night
in
and
night
out
to
play
steady
defense
and
providing
occasional
but
only
occasional
offensive
flash
offensively
he
was
even
more
disappointing
than
last
year
points
in
games
but
his
defense
improved
tremendously
he
is
probably
best
as
the
defensive
part
of
a
defense
combination
with
an
offensive
defenseman
neil
wilkinson
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
b
wilkinson
was
probably
the
teams
top
defensive
defenseman
in
however
partially
because
of
injuries
he
was
not
the
same
this
year
as
he
missed
games
total
due
to
nagging
knee
and
back
injuries
and
seemed
to
be
slowed
even
when
playing
he
then
had
often
to
be
saved
by
his
defensive
partners
that
is
if
they
are
there
at
all
but
he
also
had
some
solid
games
and
if
he
can
be
complete
healthy
he
can
still
be
a
force

a
at

of
his
injury
december
against

ozolinsh
was
well
on
track
to
be
imo
the
teams
mvp
a
serious
knee
injury
in
that
game
though
forced
him
to
miss
the
rest
of
the
season
games
but
he
still
finished
as
the
teams
top
scorer
among
defensemen
points
which
of
course
tells
more
about
the
lack
of
offense
the
sharks
had
from
their
defensemen
but
it
also
tells
of
ozolinshs
abilities
at
the
time
he
was
playing
very
good
defense
along
with
excellent
offense
he
was
still
susceptible
to
socalled
rookie
mistakes
but
was
probably
the
defenseman
who
made
the
least
of
them

doug

zmolek

basically
a
solid
and
durable
year
being
one
of
the
only
two
sharks
to
play
in
all
games
of
the
season
he
was
solid
on
defense
but
after
being
billed
as
an
offensive
defenseman
he
didnt
show
it
points
he
was
also
prone
to
penalties
and
his
penalty
minutes
was
second
on
the
team
however
that
was
also
an
indication
that
he
was
fearly
when
facing
tough
physical
opponents
and
he
was
at
his
best
when
playing
physically

to
become

if
you
were

burns
what
are
the
leafs
to
do
i
am
a
leaf
supporter
and
i
say
the
leafs
are
going
down
in
four
unless
there
is
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
or
a
stroke
of

pat

if
you
were
pat
burns
what
would
you
do
living
in
the
bay
area
i
do
not
get
enough
leaf
coverage
to
pull
something
out
of
the
bag
i
would
appreciate
comments
on
the
leafdetroit
line
matchups
but
here
is
the
basic
idea
andreychuck
and
borchevsky
have
no
business
playing
against
the
wings
they
are
too
small
the
key
to
any
leafs
success
will
have
to
be
clark
he
is
the
only
centre
who
can
have
any
presence
within
lengths
of
the
slot
where
the
hell
is
anderson
anderson
can
in
days
past
get
under
peoples
skin
put
a
little
more
bluntly
anderson
has
to
be
an
asshole
he
used
to
be
good
at
it
we
need
him
now
perhaps
perhaps
the
leafs
can
shut
down
detroits
second
line
i
was
dissappointed
to
see
shepard
and
yserbeart
flying
last
night
these
guys
are
the
swing
players
for
the
wings
last
year
they
did
a
major
choke
in
the
playoffs
and
were
to
blame
for
the
quick
exit
of
the
wings
this
has
to
happen
again
clarkandersongilmour
should
be
able
to
out
hustle
this
line
anderson
should
do
a
nasty
on
yserbeart
clark
should
bang
the
hell
out
of
sheppard
score
gilmour

as

i
would
bench
andreychuck
and
borchevsky
to
stir
things
up
and
through
a
monkey
wrench
into
detroits
game
plan
however
if
the
detroit
coaching
would
be
dumb
enough
to
play
their
checking
line
against
these
finesse
players
well
then
let
them
play
potvin
can
not
be
faulted
on
of
the
goals
keep
him
in
van
hellamond
can
not
be
faulted
for
the
leafs
demise
either
the
wings
defense
shut
down
the
leafs
especially
in
the
slot
i
hope
pat
burns
realizes
that
his
team
was
outhit
outskated
and
outcoached
on

night
this
was
not
a

as

there
are
many
teams
in
the

who
have
taken
a
liking
to
russian
players
the
whole
russian
strategy
is
not
specific
to
detroit
or
to
devellano
who
was
gm
before
murray
what
the
previous
gm
also
did
was
to
trade
away
several
players
who
have
gone
on
to
do
well
with
other
teams
most
notably
in
my
memory
murray
craven
who
had
a
few
very
good
years
with
philly
after
leaving
here
also
its
not
the
volume
of
trades
that
will
necessarily
improve
a
team
but
the
quality
of
them
trading
adam
oates
for
bernie
federko
was
just
plain
stupid
even
if
federko
used
to
be
a
great
player
at
one
time
most
of
murrays
trades
have
worked
significantly
to
the
wings
advantage
with
those
that
didnt
being
soured
mainly
by
injury
to
the
players
involved
such
as
troy
crowder
who
suffered
back
problems
from
which
he
never
really
recovered
devallano
went
earlier
and
more
extensively
to
the
russian
strategy
than
anyone
elseand
was
the
first
gm
to
waste
high
draft
choices
on
young
russiansdevallano
would
still
be
gm
but
he
succombed
to
demers
pleading
to
make
the
oatesfederko
et
al
tradewhich
is
the
deal
that
sealed
his
fate
murray
has
made
some
decent
tradesno
doubtbut
these
are
more
due
to
the
stupidity
or
cheapness
of
other
teams
than
brilliance
on
his
partwashington
was
too
cheap
to
pay
ciccarelli
so
they
essentially
gave
him
awayand
carson
was
really
a
big
anchor
to
the
team
and
he
was
able
to
sucker
a
rookie
gm
to
give
him
paul
coffey
for
deadweight
if
detroit
still
fails
this
year
because
he
was
one
defenseman
short
then
he
will
have
wasted
an
opportunity
because
manson
was
available
and
he

it

black

the
winner
of

i
hockey
national
championship
to
the
rose
garden
and
the
white

i
understand
from
senator
mitchell
that
this
is
the
first
team
from
the
university
of
maine
every
to
win
a
national
championship
and
were
glad
to
have
them
here
im
inspired
not
only
by
how
the
team
pulled
together
to
win
the
championship
but
how
the
entire
state
pulled
together
to
cheer
them
onto
victory
coming
from
a
state
that
is
also
relatively
small
in
size
but
also
filled
with
pride
and
tradition
and
community
i
can
understand
how
the
people
of
maine
must
feel
about
the
black
bears
in
our
state
people
are
still
talking
about
the
time
we
won
the
orange
bowl
over
the
number
one
ranked
football
team
and
that
was
back
in
im
sure
that
years
from
now
the
people
of
maine
will
as
proud
of
this
team
as
they
are
today
you
know
in
my
state
football
is
a
slightly
more
popular
sport
than
hockey
we
dont
have
a
lot
of
ice
laughter
but
after
spending
three
months
getting
banged
around
in
this
town
i
can
understand
a
little
more
about
hockey
than
i
did
before
i
came
here
hockey
is
a
tough
game
its
a
hardhitting
sport
it
does
have
one
virtue
though
theres
a
penalty
for
delay
of
game
i
wish
we
had
that
rule
in
the
senate
laughter
in
government
as
in
hockey
leadership
is
important
in
the
united
states
senate
our
team
has
a
great
captain
the
majority
leader
and
the
senior
senator
from
maine
george
mitchell
junior
senator
cohen
looks
so
young
i
cant
imagine
laughter
im
actually
bitter
about
senator
cohen
because
he
looks
so
much
younger
than
me
on
your
hockey
team
the
captain
jim
montgomery
has
done
a
great
job
he
scored
the
winning
goal
late
in
the
championship
game
leading
you
to
a
comefrombehind
victory
something
else
i
know
a
little
bit
about
sport
brings
out
the
best
in
individuals
and
in
teams
and
in
communities
i
share
the
pride
that
senator
mitchell
and
senator
cohen
and
congressman
andrews
and
all
the
people
of
maine
must
feel
for
the
black
bears
who
have
shown
us
all
how
to
play
as
a
team
how
to
bring
out
the
best
in
one
another
and
how
to
come
from
behind
i
think
its
important
as
i
ask
young

q
mr
president
did
you
authorize
the
move
on
waco
this
morning
sir
the
president
i
was
aware
of
it
i
think
the
attorney
general
made
the
decision
and
i
think
i
should
refer
all
questions
to
her
and
to
the
fbi
q
did
you
have
any
instructions
for
her
as
to
how
it
should
be
executed
the
president
no
they
made
the
tactical
decisions
that
was
their
judgment
the
fbi
q
is
this
a
raid
the
president
and
i
will
i
want
to
refer
you
to
talk
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
fbi
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
done
but
the
decisions
were
entirely
theirs
all
the
tactical
decisions
q
what
did
you
and
senator
mitchell
talk
about
this
morning
q
any
chance
for
that
stimulus
package
the
president
senator
mitchell
ought
to
pay
my
quarter
laughter
i
was
in
there
laughter
senator
mitchell
you
have
to
pay
that
quarter
the
president
i
was
ready
laughter
senator
mitchell
hes
worth
a
quarter
any
day
q
any
chance
for
your
bill
sir
the
president
we
talked
about
what
was
going
to
happen
this
week
in
the
senate
and
about
what
other
meetings
were
going
to
have
for
the
rest
of
the
week
we
only
had
about
five
minutes
to
talk
and
we
agreed
wed
get
back
together
later
around
noon
and
talk
some
more
q
senator
dole
said
over
the
weekend
that
your
compromise
is
no
compromise
the
president
well
i
know
he
did
but
look
senator
dole
and
a
lot
of
the
other
republicans
now
in
the
senate
voted
for
the
same
kind
of
thing
for
ronald
reagan
in
and
our
research
indicates
that
a
majority
of
them
over
time
voted
for
a
total
of
emergency
spending
measures
totalling
over
billion
when
reagan
and
bush
were
president
in
those
administrations
and
many
of
those
purposes
were
not
nearly
as
worthy
as
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
i
dont
want
to
go
back
and
revisit
every
one
but
you
can
do
it
you
can
look
at
the
research
there
so
this
position
theyre
taking
is
not
credible
we
have
a
very
tough
fiveyear
deficit
reduction
plan
all
these
costs
are
covered
during
that
time
and
then
some
and
the
very
people
that
are
saying
this
has
all
got
to
be
paid
for
dont
have
much
of
a
history
on
which
to
base
their
position
theyve
got
years
of
vote
for
stimulus
measures
of
this
kind
that
had
very
little
to
with
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
so
i
think
weve
got
a
chance
to
work
it
out
and
im
hopeful
well
see
what
happens
today
and
tomorrow
im
feeling

i
havent

so
thats

the

is
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
did
last

i
had
the

the

yes
id
rather

btw
those

i

they

wasnt

they
did

they
were

that

he
goes
orgasmic

despite
which

scores
and
even
more
excited
if
possible
for
great

he
did
a
good

leafs
versus

how
long
can
the
leafs
play
shorthanded
and
still
be
expected
to
score
they
did
some
fine
penelykilling
in
the
first
men
down
for
a
couple
of
minutes
at
one
point
but
they
just
couldnt
keep
it
up
they
spent
virtually
the
entire
game
either
shorthanded
or
just
coming
off
a
penelty
as
soon
as
theyd
get
regrouped
theyre
penalized
again
sheesh
like
gilmour
said
after
the
you
cant
go
calling
every
little
push
an
shove
in
a
game
like
that
and
if
youre
going
to
you
have
to
do
it
for
both
teams
pearson
one
of
my
four
favorite
leafs
played
like
a
bonehead
i
saw
him
personally
screw
up
at
least
good
scoring
opportunities
and
then
he
got
that
bonehead
major
highsticking
penalty
cullen
has
gotten
stronger
since
his
return
from
injury
a
handfull
of
games
ago
and
he
played
a
good
game
if
the
other
players
on
his
line
can
smarten
up
that
line
should
do
okay
clarks
got
to
get
tough
hes
got
to
intimidate
and
go
for
the

send
clark
up
the
left
wing
over
the
blue
line
a
couple
times
his
patented
wrist
shot
will
put
some
numbers
on

board
and
pearson
heck
maybe
he
should
be
benched
i
hate
to
repeat
grapes
but
where
the
heck
was
foligno
zezel
cant
do
all
the
checking
himself
and
get

we
need

out
there
keep
potvin
in

he
did
okay
considering
although
like
i
said
a

potvin
messed
up
in
a

games
in
the
ahl

last

he
can

do

a

i
know
i
know
youre
not

bear
with
me
a

is
worth

getting
two

is
the

as
getting
one
win
if
your

won

youd

all
of
this
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
was
a
bad
gm
i
merely
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contender
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
as
great
as
you
claim
the
wings
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probably
more
than
once
if
he
was
as
great
a
gm
as
you
claim
i
think
you
missed
one
of
my
points
there
it
takes
more
than
a
great
gm
to
win
a
stanley
cup
even
once
some
of
the
guys
on
the
list
you
gave
earlier
never
won
one
i
agree
that
you
and
i
could
probably
argue
back
and
forth
for
days
to
no
avail
about
who
is
the
best
gm
in
hockey
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
who
is
to
say
my
opinion
is
any
better
than
yours
or
yours
than
mine
but
the
point
of
my
original
original
post
if
not
well
stated
was
that
murray
has
the
gm
abilities
but
not
the
coaching
abilities
which
leads
to
below
and
he
was
as
poor
a
coach
as
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intelligent
enough
to
hire
the
coach
to
push
the
team
to
the
next
level
of
success
i
think
at
this
point
theres
a
personal
emotional
element
involved
here
which
transcends
murrays
logical
thought
as
outsiders
its
fine
for
us
to
say
he
should
hire
a
different
coach
in
fact
he
has
talked
about
doing
so
in
the
past
but
the
press
here
in
detroit
at
least
has
so
built
up
this
business
about
murray
never
getting
past
the
second
round
of
the
playoffs
as
a
coach
that
i
think
he
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
prove
to
the
world
that
he
is
capable
of
coaching
a
team
past
the
second
round
he
needs
to
as
the
papers
say
get
that
monkey
off
his
back
so
it
becomes
a
matter
not
of
intelligence
but
of
pride
is
it
foolish
to
let
pride
stand
in
the
way
of
sound
logic
perhaps
but
were
all
a
little
that
way
from
time
to
time
i
think
eventually
hell
step
down
from
behind
the
bench
and
concentrate
on
his
gm
duties
and
the
team
will
improve
as
a
result
i
think
his
coaching
duties
take
away
time
he
might
have
otherwise
spent
on
gm
work
in
that
sense
once
he
steps
down
as
coach
well
see
how
good
of
a
gm
he
really
is
but
murray
is
an
average
unspectacular
nhl
coach
and
a
pretty
good
gm
so
none
of
this
is
true
anyway
i
may
not
agree
with
everything
youve
said
but
its
been
fun
discussing
it
with
you

roy
was
the
reason
the
game
was
tied
and
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
dionne
kept
his
cool
hextall
gave
up
very
questionable
goals
himself
both
dionnes
and
bellows
shots
were
misplayed
by
hextall
but
just
because
his
gaffes
were
early
in
the
game
no
one
seems
to
care
roy
stood
on
his
head
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
game
when
the
nords
were
rushing
from
endtoend
kamenskys
minibreak
after
the
tying
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excellent
chances
stopped
by
roy
roy
outplayed
hextall
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becomes
the
villain
and
hextall
the
hero
because
roys
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportunities
hextall
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucky
bounces
he
played
very
well
but
the
haller
shot
off
the
post
in
ot
the
rebound
bouncing
over
bellows
stick
the
brunet
breakaway
the
chances
for
leclair
all
those
opportunities
were
not
finished
off
by
montreal
and
it
cost
them
hextall
wasnt
particularly
brilliant
on
those
plays
blaming
stewart
is
just
an
excuse
to
avoid
facing
the
fact
that
roy
allowed
what
was
one
of
the
worst
goals
he
could
possibly
allow
he
even
saw
the
whole
shot
dammit
sure
no
excuse
but
it
was
just
the
goal
the
timing
stank
but
against
an
explosive
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportunity
too
many
with
a
powerplay
that
was
totally
unnecessary
montreal
played
a
solid
game
although
they
still
dont
know
how
to
clear
traffic
in
front
of
the
net
the
loss
of
schneider
will
hurt
even
more
i
disagree
roy
played
well
because
he
wasnt
screened
the
whole
night
the
defense
for
the
time
this
season
played
remarkably
keeping
sakic
nolan
and
sundin
out
of
the
slot
most
of
the
night
normally
i
would
say
that
any
team
that
blows
a
lead
with
less
than
five
let
alone
two
minutes
to
go
in
regulation
time
in
a
playoff
game
especially
needs
to
be
smacked
upside

heads
but
i
dont

this
was
a
team
loss
although
keane
should
have
been
able
to
clear
the
zone
just
prior
to
the
first
quebec
goal
this
most
certainly
was
a
team
loss
leclair
missed
his
opportunities
as
did
bellows
and
brunet
dionne
took
a
bad

were

all

roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
means
can
be
singled
out
for
this
loss
roy
is
paid
big
money
to
play
he
looked
like
a
player
in
an
industrial
league
on
sakics
shot
and
hextall
didnt
on
dionnes
goal
please
roy
is
paid
big
money
because
that
is
his
value
compared
to
other
goalies
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
when
you
consider
the
defense
or
lack
of
one
that
played
in
front
of
him
for
most
of
the
season
demers
should
start
racicot
in
the
next
game
if
not
that
he
should
let
the
damn
team
read
the
papers
for
the
next
day
or
twoand
maybe
this
article
if
possible
the
montreal
media
is
the
quickest
to
heap
praise
and
then
hurl
derogatory
comments
against
the
habs
they
are
no
better
than
uninformed
fans
why
should
they
read
the
papers
they
played
minutes
of
burnsian
hockey
to
shut
down
quebec
all
they
need
tonight
and
for
the
rest
of
the
series
is
the
extra
red
light
to
face
quebecrubbish
thats
a
guaranteed
way
to
end
the

who
would
be
taught
a
lesson
by
this
the
fans
the
media
and
racicot
perhaps
certainly
not
the
rest
of
the
team
i
didnt
think
the
wraparound
was
as
bad
as
the
second
goal
i
also
didnt
think
scott
young
should
have
gotten
around
the
defender
cant
remember
who
in
the
first
place
but
you
are
correct
it
shouldnt
have
gone
in
regardless
if
you
mean
the
goal
should
never
have
gone
in
because
there
should
never
have
been
an
ot
then
i
agree
but
the
goal
itself
was
a
great
piece
of
work
by
young
roy
had
both
the
near
and
far
posts
covered
but
young
flipped
the
puck
up
under
roys
arm
as
he
wrappedaround
the

with

there
has

that
has
ever

you
need
one
person
making
the
personnel
decisions
at

not

by

the
conventional
wisdom
from
around
the
league
is
that
ferreira
would
have
made
the
moves
that
would
have
fielded
a
better
product
on
the
ice
how
exactly
would
ferreira
accomplished
this
the

has
taken
a

of
heat
but
nobodys
explained
how
things
would
have
been
any

had

would

made
more
trades
who
would
have
he
had
traded
would
he
have
made
fewer
trades
who
should
not
have
been
traded
i
think
the
threeheaded
gms
guiding
principle
was
to
keep
veterans
in
favor
of
youngsters
only
if
they
offered
a
significant
advantage
at
the
end
of
last
season
the
contracts
of
several
veterans
with
somewhat
maginal
contributions
fenton
bozek
anderson
and
a
couple
others
i
cant
remember
were
bought
out
the
idea
was
that
youngsters
could
play
almost
as
well
and
had
the
potential
to
improve
where
these
older
guys
did
not
and
they
traded
mullen
because
he
wanted
to
go
not
because
he
wasnt
good
enough
but
i
think
they
were
a
bit
too
optimistic
in
thinking
they
could
make
up
for
his
contributions
an
example
from
this
season
skriko
was
brought
in
on
a
trial
basis
but
not
kept
because
of
his
age
i
thought
he
was
a
decent
contributor
worth
keeping
around
the
youth
movement
has
its
advantages
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veterans
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balance

minnesota
scene
to
those
who
are
wondering
what
is
happening
in
minnesota
from
what
i
have
seen
in
the
local
news
tv
and
newspaper
various
people
in
the
area
are
trying
to
get
a
new
hockey
team
a
columnist
for
the
st
paul
pioneer
press
wrote
an
article
giving
the
inside
scoop
on
the
issue
there
are
three
local
sites
competing
for
a
team
and
three
possible
candiates
to
move
to
the
twin
cities
first
the
sites
target
center
civic
center
st
paul
and
yes
even
the
met
center
the
columnist
was
pretty
confident
that
minnesota
will
get
a
team
and
that
the
target
center
will
ultimately
win
out
he
argued
however
that
the
competition
from
the
other
two
sites
will
delay
the
process
considerably
without
the
intersite
competition
the
columnist
sorry
i
cant
remember
his
name
believes
that
minnesota
would
have
a
team
by
the
season
also
because
of
the
situation
with
the
timberwolves
things
will
be
delayed
until
unless
the
city
of
minneapolis
takes
over
the
target
center
however
they
are
unlikely
to
do
so
until
the
met
center
is
destroyed
because
the
city
will
lose
money
if
there
is
competition
from
the
met
for
conventions
and
shortterm
events
even
with
hockey
at
target
to
add
to
this
mess
a
study
to
months
is
going
to
be
conducted
on
the
future
viability
of
the
met
center
which
obviously
delays
the
process
even
further
i
hope
that
the
study
is
cancelled
which
will
have
the
effect
of
knocking
the
met
center
out
of
the
running
and
perhaps
encouraging
minneapolis
to
take
over
the
target
center
sooner
the
city
would
be
be
even
more
encourged
if
the
wrecking
ball
is
taken
to
the
met
which
may
happen
regarding
possible
candidates
the
three
teams
are
hartford
tampa
bay
and
new
jersey
i
would
prefer
the
devils
minnesota
ice
demons
although
the
lightning
may
have
potential
although
it
hasnt
been
announced
yet
it
looks
like
neutral
site
games
will
be
played
at
the
target
center
next
year
apparently
the
devils
are
interested
in
playing
in
as
many
of
those
six
games
as
possible
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
hartford
and
tampa
show
up
there
either
so
minnesota
may
end
up
getting
another
team
but
it
may
take
a
few
years

for

a

how
extensive
is
the

coverage
down
there
in

it
is
almost
impossible
not

ie
the
only
two
series
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
watch
this

are
washnyi
and
chistl
the
latter
because
im
in
the
wrong
time
zone
we
in
canada
are
basically
swamped
with
coverage
and
i
wonder
how
many
seriesgames
are
televised
nationally
or
even
locally
in
the
us
and
how
much
precedence
they
take
over

local

mike

came
out

fired
a
breakout

that
hit
fuhr
in
the
back
of
the
leg
fuhr
was
backing
up
at
the
time
and
never
saw
what
happened
the

went
straight
off
fuhrs
leg

into

fuhr
never
had
a
chance
there
was
no
play
back
to
the
goaltender
in
fact
perry
berezan
of
calgary
had
just
dumped
it
in
and
smith
was
retrieving
it
it
was
unfortunate
that
it
happened
smith
is
a
nice
guy
and
was
only
a
rookie
at
the
time
and
on
his
birthday
too
but
all
the
blame
lies
with
him
starting
in
peewee
coaches
tell
players
never
to
make
a
crossice
pass
in
front
of
their
own
net
too
much
chance
of
having
it
intercepted
or
hitting
the
goaltender
or
whatever
and
to
the
people
who
say
that
smith
cost
the
oilers
the
series
i
can
only
say
that
he
certainly
didnt
cause
the
team
to
lose
the
other
three
games
there
was
no
reason
for
a
powerhouse
team
like
edmonton
to
be
tied
late
in
the
third
period
of
the
game
of
the

everybody
on

rose
as

officially
clinched

minutes

blues
coach

said
if
the
goal
had
counted
hed
have
been
more
upset
than
he
was
by
the
blues
disappearance
in
the
final
minutes
holding
on
for
the
victory
and
making

tempered
berrys
anger
it
wasnt
pretty
at
the
end
he
said
we
played
great
minutes
as
good
as
we
played
all
year
it
slipped
away
at
the
end
it
shouldnt
have
but
it
did
still
the
blues
won
prompting
another
ovation
from
the
crowd
at
games
end
despite
their
shoddy
effort
in
the
third
period
and
all
the
turmoil
this
season

still
made

semifinal
beginning
at

sunday
at

the

finished
the

with

fourth
consecutive
season
minnesota
finished
three

tampa
bay
which
played
spoiler
last
week
by
tying
the
blues
at
tampa
ended
its
first
season
with
a
record
of
for
points
the
poor
finish
cast
an
unnecessary
shadow
over
what
should
have
been
a
joyous
blues
locker
room
instead
the
mood
was
one
of
relief
and
some
disappointment
its
a
shame
we
let
down
said
kevin
miller
one
of
three
blues
to
score
two
goals
brendan
shanahan
and
bob
bassen
were
the
others
there
was
no
need
for
a
letdown
if
wed
have
kept
working
it
would
have
ended
and
everyone
would
be
happy
instead
a
lot
of
players
were
happy
just
to
make
the
playoffs
we
won
and
thats
all
that
matters
said
brett
hull
scoreless
and
for
the
night
once
we
got
up
it
was
really
tough
to
play
some
players
didnt
have
a
problem
just
because
the
score
was
announced
our
line
didnt
quit
said
rich
sutter
who
played
with
bassen
and
miller
we
still
had
a
game
to
play
you
cant
allow
five
goals
like
we
did
thats
not
right
it
was
disappointing
to
see
what
was
going
on
bassen
was
almost
frantic
on
the
bench
because
of
the
blues
effort
somehow
he
missed
the
announcement
of
minnesotas
loss
i
didnt
know
it
was
final
he
said
i
was
kind
of
looking
around
on
the
bench
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
final
for
some
reason
were
in
the
playoffs
and
thats
great
but
its
a
little
disappointing
to
play
like
we
did
at
the
end
the
letdown
was
precisely
the
reason
that
berry
had
instructed
the
scoreboard
operators
to
keep
the
minnesotadetroit
score
off
of
the
board
the
score
showed
until
it
first
popped
up
with
detroit
leading
in
the
third
period
the
blues
already
led
at
the
time
i
told
them
i
didnt
want
to
see
the
score
i
didnt
want
to
know
the
score
berry
said
i
felt
we
had
to
win
the
game
and
thats
the
approach
we
took
if
minnesota
took
a
lead
berry
feared
the
pressure
of
having
to
win
might
bother
the
blues
if
detroit
led
he
worried
the
blues
might
quit
until
the
announcement
the
blues
played
splendidly
shanahan
got
the
crowd
going
at
of
the
first
period
scoring
his
of
the
season
then
miller
and
bassen
took
charge
late
in
the
period
with
the
teams
playing
four
on
four
miller
broke
in
on
left
wing
deked
defenseman
roman
hamrlik
and
beat
former
blues
goalie
pat
jablonski
with
the
rebound
of
his
own
shot
with
seconds
remaining
in
the
period
then
just
seconds
later
bassen
rifled
a
long
slap
shot
past
jablonski
after
defenseman
rick
zombo
intercepted
a
tampa
pass
in
the
neutral
zone
bassen
made
it
just
seconds
into
the
second
period
scoring
on
the
rebound
of
bret
hedicans
shot
the
goal
gave
him
his
first
twogoal
game
of
the
season
and
reminded
him
of
a
special
friend
last
year
bassen
befriended
young
oliver
mulvihill
who
died
of
a
rare
form
of
cancer
at
age
on
feb
i
was
thinking
of
my

bassen
said
hes
in

now
and
i

increased

to
on

re
european

our
fcked
system
how
long
would
they
support
teams
that
are
run
on
rangerbased
corporate
thinking
i
use
the
term
lightly
we
dont
need
a
good
product
because
these
duffuses
in
nyc
would
fill
the
arena
for
ottawas
record
every
haha
sorry
had
ta
say
it
look
how
long
the
maple
leafs
and
nordiques
used
similar
logic
not
that
they
fielded
bad
teams
solely
to
field
bad
teams
but
the
maple
leafs
and
a
certain
dead
man
who
was
in
charge
were
one
of
the
cheapest
teams
in
the
history
of
the
sport
guess
what
they
were
immensely
popular
at
the
gate
the
nordiques
have
also
done
well
for
a
team
that
had
missed
the
playoffs
so
many
years
in
a
row
look
at
british
or
any
european
soccer
as
an
example
they
never
have
fan
problems
ha
such
humor
they
have
major
fan
problems
namely
that
on
occasion
some
of
them
dont
make
it
home
from
the
match
the
soccer
fans
tend
to
be
fanatical
much
like
the
montreal
fans
who
firebomb

players

when

well
now
that

the

is
a

let
toronto

detroit
beat
the

out

while
chicago
sweeps
stlouis
that
just
makes
it
easier
in
the
second
round
with
all
the
rest
they
will
get
and
tordet
getting
none
for
the
conf
champ
they
will
have
a
hard
time
versus
the
division
but
that
div
will
be
pretty
battered
also
so
the
advantage
goes
to
the
hawks
again
then
bring
pitt
and
sure
the
hawks
will
probably
lose
but
its
better
to
get
that
far
and
lose
than
to
not
go
brian
hopefully
a
miracle
ok
not
quite
a
miracle
but
close
will
occur
and
pittsburgh
will
be
elminated
prior
to
the
finals
if
they
make
it
again
they
will
probably
keep
the

if
they

farewell

it
just
seems

the

in

should
have
an
nhl
team
as
well
the
loss
of
the
team
is
certainly
not
the
fault
of
the
fans
though
the
start
of
the
season
made
it
look
real
bad
for

that
i
kept
the

cap
i
bought
at
maple

the

jagr
can
be

this
rubbed

on

are
a

it

funny
you
should

this
one

on

don
cherry
pointed
out
vanbiesbroucks
mask
he
hated

i
think
he
said
something
to
the
effect
of
you
see
he
was
great
last
year
now
he
goes
out
and
gets
that
dopey
mask
and
he
cant
stop
a

you
may
or
may
not
take
cherry
seriously
at
all
but
i
cracked
up
when
i

it
i
think
ed
belfour
has
the
current
best

why

all
about

the
obvious
fact
that
lemeuixs
career
was
never
endangered
by
graves
slash
while
neely
is
still
bother
by
his
injury
i
think
the
most
important
reason
is
adam
graves
has
played
clean
hockey
ever
since
while
ulf
samulesson
continues
to
play
dirtyyes
trying
to
hit
a
player
where
hes
injured
is
dirty
fans
have
can
forget

one
dirty
play

how
can
you
forget
about
ulf
samulesson
when
everynight
when
i
watch
hockey
high
lights
i
get
reminded
of
how
dirty
he
is
hitting
a
player
when
hes
injured
is
dirty
can
you
explain
this
statement
do
you
mean
a
player
who
was
just
injured
on
the
ice
or
do
you
mean
a
player
who
is
playing
hurt
if
a
player
is
hurt
he
should
not
bother
playing
because
i
dont
belive
any
player
should
be
let
up
on
just
because
they
are
playing
hurt
im
not
an
ulf
fan
but
at
least
i
can
spot
the
fact
he
is
like
calgarys
theoren
fleury
in
the
respect
that
part
of
his
game
is
to
really
piss
other
players
off
as
thats
part
of
his
job
but
he
lacks
ulfs
size
i
am
an
ulf
and
pgh
fan
and
what
pisses
me
off
about
the
whole
adam
graves
ulf
samuesson
debate
is
that
ulf
plays
hardhitting
hockey
nothing
wrong
with
that
while
graves
does
what
he
does
when
the
only
way
to
win
a
game
is
to
intentionally
hurt
someone
which
bites
players
that
really
piss
me
off
are
the
ones
who
insist
on
hitting
from
behind
or
try
to
go
for
the
knees
to
injure
the
players
this
kind
of
garbage
has
got
to
go
i
would
really
like
to
see
muni
get
pasted
as
he
is
one
of
the
worst
offenders
i
thought
they
had
instituted
all
kinds
of
new
rules
this
season
to
stop
crap
like
that
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
officiating
just
still
stink
to
high
heaven
imho
if
they
could
get
rid
of
the
existing
refs
and
institute
a
new
system
with
more
than
one
ref
on
the
ice
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
troublemakers
then
a
lot
of
these
things
would
stop

i
dont
know
whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his

or
whether
hes
a
canadian
thing
altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
for
those
of
you
who
complain
about
don

wonder
why
he
is

is

little

with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string
of
american
posts
saying
that
john
madden
has
lost
his
marbles
dick
vitale
is
always
promoting
this
kid
from
this
high
school
or
that
college
with
outrageous
statements
why
should
americans
expect
that
canada
would
not
have
such
characters
in
relation
to
our
greatest
passionwhich
is
hockey
canadians
are
very
similar
to
americansculturally
our
sports
are
just
hockey
and
curling
whereas
with
americans
it
is
footballbasketballbaseball
and
bowling
gerald
id
like
to
add
that
i
think
canadian
hockey
fans
like
don
because
his
kind
of
hockey
the
hockey
he
promotes
in
his
tv
appearances
is
the
kind
that
they
think
used
to
get
played
in
the
old
team
nhl
so
theres
a
kind
of
nostagia
for
the
old
days
before
expansion
the
soviet
series
gretzky
and
even
bobby
orr
when
guys
werent
afraid
to
take
a
hit
nobody
floated
and
defensemen
played
defence
who
cares
that
that
probably
never
really
existed
the
myth
is
still
around
in
canada
and
all
the
european
in
fluence
on
the
game
has
diminished
it
in
some
peoples
eyes
personally
id
like
to
add
before
i
get
flamed
i
love
the
fastpaced
european
game
and
think
don
cherry
is
a
bit
of
an

i
have

i
missed

was
hurt
i
expect
hell
surface
with
another
team
at
some
point
probably
another
expansion
team
but
is
likely
to
be
a
bubble
player
for
the
rest
of
his
career
has
a
good
work
ethic
and
is
good
at
getting
other
players
motivated
unfortunately
he
played
himself
out
of
the
sharks
future
with
a
bad
judgement
call
john
carter
season
acquired
free
agent
from
boston
grade
i
bb
he
is
very
unlikely
to
be
back
next
season
always
gave
best
work
ethic
on
the
club
except
maybe
kisio
but
hustle
isnt
always
enough
his
future
with
the
sharks
was
made
clear
to
me
one
night
against
the
flames
when
he
went
behind
the
crease
and
tried
to
hold
joel
otto
against
the
board
he
literally
had
one
arm
around
ottos
neck
and
another
wrapped
around
ottos
stick
arm
otto
casually
turned
around
and
fed
the
puck
in
front
of
the
crease
for
a
goal
as
though
carter
wasnt
there
hustle
can
only
cover
size
so
far
the
sharks
have
told
me
point
blank
that
hes
gone
for
good
ditto
hubie
mcdonough
he
was
one
of
the
favorites
of
the
staff
but
as
one
said
to
me
you
have
to
make
room
for
the
kids
carter
in
fact
refused
to
report
to
kc
and
has
been
suspended
by
the
sharks
that
might
be
a
defacto
retirement
but
i
havent
heard
anything
official
his
only
hope
in
hockey
now
is
the

jeanfrancois
quintin
season
acquired
from

bb
i
dont
understand
why
the
sharks
didnt
let
quintin
play
any
more
than
the
games
he
played
this
season
because
at
least
from
the
games
i
saw
him
in
he
was
outmatched
and
looked
fairly
lost
on
the
ice
i
think
he
shows
potential
but
i
didnt
think
he
was
quite
ready
to
make
the
jump
to
the
nhl
he
should
be
a
solid
contender
for
regular
duty
next
season
agreed
btw
i
still
think
a
lot
of
your
grades
are
more
based
on
how
you
wish
theyd
performed
than
how
they
actually
performed
i
wonder
whether
you
can

judge

detroit

theres
a

of

would
make

fast
so
toronto
would
have
to
slow
the

down
which
means
drawing
penalties
as
a
last
resort
anyway
toronto
will
be
a
good
team
as
soon

they

toronto
is

detroit

i
watched
the

germanyczechs
in

todayand
i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every
possible
sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
i
can
understand
your
anger
about
the
german
audience
i
mean
it
was
the
finnish
team
they
played
and
they
were
taking
advantage
of
the
ridiculous
penalties
the
canadien
ref
called
in
the
last
period
the
germans
got
a
match
penalty
and
a
minutes
misconduct
for
practically
nothing
and
seconds
after
that
the
german
goalie
got
two
minutes
for
delay
of
game
for
a
shot
that
was
deflected
and
went
into
the
crowd
the
resulting
skating
advantage
lead
to
the
deciding
goal
at
a
point
when
the
germans
were
starting
to
come
up
strong
i
am
also
sick
of
the
nationalism
that
is
going
on
in
german
sports
events
if
you
watch
for
example
a
tennis
davis
cup
match
the
players
are
often
not
able
to
play
for
minutes
because
the
crowd
is
so
obnoxious
but
i
have
to
admit
that
this
kind
of
nationalism
is
as
strong
or
even
stronger
in
most
other
countries
you
should
go
to
the
us
and
watch
the
way
they
present
the
olympics
on
television
or
the
soccer
crowds
in
england
or
the
finnish
spectators
at
nordic
skiing
events
i
mean
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
all
this
nationalism
all
over
the
world
and
i
would
rather
see
the
best
teamplayer
win
and
get
cheared
at
i
do
not
mind
if
my
favorite
team
looses
to
somebody
that
is
better
or
plays
more
attractive
and
i
have
to
admit
that
in
most
sports
the
german
national
site
is
not
my
favorite
team
to
watch
the
german
soccer
team
is
boring
to
watch
for
example
but
reading
the
above
posting
i
think
that
you
are
on
the
same
level
as
these
crowds
you
are
criticizing
it
is
easy
to
talk
of
nearly
all
germans
as
nazis
and
nationalists
thats
the
kind
of
propaganda
that
all
ultraconservative
people
use
against
germany
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
great
danger
of
rearising
nationalism
in
germany
but
from
my
experience
most
of
the
people
at
least
of
the
people
that
i
know
also
regard
this
as
a
big
threat
and
are
trying
to
demonstrate
this
attitude
now
why
cant
we
just
look
at
people
as
human
beeings
and
not
try
to
put
them
into
drawers
corresponding
to
their
nationality
eg
all
russians
are
communists
all
americans
are
capitalists
all
germans
are
nazis
all
fins
are
hanging
around
beeing
drunk
on
ferries
in
my
opinion
your
comment
shows
the
narrowness
of
your
mind
and
that
you
dont
seem
to
be
different
from
the
nazis
you
are

that
alexander

will
go
hell
either
stay

be

in

quebec
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championships
daigle
didnt
show
this
for
his
junior
team
san
jose
will
then
get
kariya
tampa
bay
will
either
go
for
a
russian
kozlov
i
think
thats
it
or
a
defenseman
rob
niedemeyer
probably
spelt
the
last
name
wrong
the
last
name
is
niedermayer
as
in
new
jerseys
scotts
last
name
because
you
guessed
it
they
are
brothers
but
rob
niedermayer
is
a
center
not
a
defenseman
i
am
not
sure
that
the
sharks
will
take
kariya
they
arent
saying
much
but
they
apparently
like
niedermayer
and
victor
kozlov
along
with
kariya
chris
prongers
name
has
also
been
mentioned
my
guess
is
that
theyll
take
niedermayer
they
may
take
pronger
except
that
they
already
have
too
many
defensive
prospects
go

theme
by

daily
news
barry
melroses
decision
to
stick
robb
stauber
in
the
stands
rather
than
in
the
crease
or
even
on
the
bench
for
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
does
not
sit
well
with
the
rookie
goaltender
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
team
at
the
most
crucial
time
of
the
year
the
most
fun
time
of
the
year
and
im
not
stauber
said
with
some
emotion
monday
i
think
i
have
worked
hard
enough
for
that
stauber
said
he
accepts
melroses
choice
of
kelly
hrudey
as
the
teams
top
goalie
in
their
playoff
series
with
the
calgary
flames
hrudey
made
saves
in
sundays
opening
victory
but
stauber
clearly
is
upset
with
his
sudden
status
as
the
no
man
behind
rick
knickle
stauber
had
a
record
and
goalsagainst
average
down
the
stretch
in
the
regular
season
and
nearly
wrestled
the
no
job
from
hrudey
knickle
he
won
of
decisions
but
had
a
bloated
average
twice
was
yanked
from
games
once
for
stomach
cramps
and
hasnt
played
since
march
yet
when
the
series
resumes
wednesday
knickle
will
serve
as
hrudeys
backup
again
and
stauber
will
have
to
satisfy
his
playoff
hunger
by
munching
on
olympic
saddledome
popcorn
if
im
supposedly
close
to
being
the
starter
or
could
have
been
the
starteri
dropped
too
what
happened
to
no
stauber
wondered
not
that
id
be
happy
with
no
but
i
feel
i
should
at
least
be
a
part
of
this
team
in
the
playoffs
perhaps
stauber
eventually
will
get
his
chance
but
melrose
apparently
is
not
convinced
the
old
is
capable
of
handling
playoff
pressure
while
insisting
he
is
the
kings
goalie
of
the
future
melrose
said
stauber
flubbed
all
four
of
the
big
games
he
was
asked
to
win
this
season
they
were
according
to
melrose
a
loss
to
san
jose
on
dec
an
loss
to
the
new
york
rangers
on
jan
a
tie
with
detroit
on
feb
an
loss
to
vancouver
on
thursday
four
times
this
season
robb
could
have
emerged
as
the
elite
goalie
he
could
have
taken
it
away
from
kelly
hrudey
and
he
didnt
do
it
melrose
said
an
elite
goaltender
has
to
carry
the
ball
when
you
give
it
to
him
the
mark
of
a
great
goalie
is
that
he
isnt
satisfied
to
be
a
backup
im
not
blaming
robb
for
the
losses
but
if
youre
going
to
be
no
youve
got
to
be
able
to
walk
your
talk
youve
got
to
be
able
to
play
when
everything
is
on
the
line
robb
stauber
has
a
great
deal
of
ability
but
maybe
i
expect
more
from
him
than
he
does
ouch
that
remark
stung
stauber
he
began
the
season
struggled
when
the
team
hit
a
midseason
slump
didnt
play
for
a
month
after
knickle
was
signed
off
the
san
diego
gulls
roster
then
came
on
at
the
end
i
expect
more
from
myself
than
anybody
including
barry
melrose
said
stauber
a
threeyear
star
at
the
university
of
minnesota
who
left
school
in
only
to
have
his
development
hampered
by
a
string
of
serious
injuries
what
ive
been
through
the
last
four
years
two
knee
operations
a
herniated
disk
in
my
back
shoulder
surgery
what
more
can
i
go
through
i
obviously
do
expect
a
lot
from
myself
otherwise
i
wouldnt
be
here
anybody
who
would
disagree
with
that
doesnt
know
me
im
not
saying
barry
doesnt
know
me
but
dont
say
ive
been
without
expectations
if
anything
im
a
perfectionist
stauber
acknowledged
he
played
poorly
in
the
four
games
melrose
mentioned
but
even
though
i
didnt
play
well
i
get
knocked
down
from
maybe
on
to
three
its
a
bit
of
a
jump
he
said
youre
almost
no
or
if
you
play
a
good
game
youre
no
and
if
you
dont
youre
no
why
does
jack
nicklaus
shoot
a
and
then
a
can
you
explain
that
thats
what
barry
wanted
me
to
explain
to
him
why
i
didnt
come
through
when
he
counted
on
me
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
its
a
sport
ill
be
there
melroses
goalie
of
the
future
statement
doesnt
mean
much
to
stauber
before
you
know
it
ill
be

there
will
be

in

the
first
period
started
with
a
give
away
from
a
canadian
defenseman
and
rundqvist
came
in
alone
on
ranford
but
couldnt
put
the
puck
over
a
sliding
ranford
later
on
kevin
dineen
had
a
great
opportunity
but
soderstrom
played
very
well
too
stefan
nilsson
had
a
couple
of
great
dekes
and
set
up
jan
larsson
but
again
ranford
came
up
big
period
ended
scoreless
but
the
edge
to
sweden
in
creating
more
opportunities
second
period
action
saw
tommy
soderstrom
making
a
great
save
mark
recchi
made
a
backhanded
cross
ice
pass
to
lindros
eric
one
timed
the
puck
but
soderstrom
was
there
to
make
a
glove
hand
save
at
the
mark
canada
started
applying
pressure
on
the
swedes
sandersondineenbrindamour
worked
hard
and
kept
the
puck
in
the
swedes
zone
dineen
gave
the
puck
to
sanderson
who
skated
around
a
screened
swedish
defenseman
came
in
on
soderstrom
and
made
a
wrist
shot
that
went
it
by
soderstroms
far
post
canada
the
swedes
picked
up
their
game
after
that
and
peter
forsberg
had
a
shot
that
hit
ranfords
post
the
inside
went
parallel
to
the
goal
line
and
out
then
gartner
got
a
penalty
and
the
swedes
a
power
play
jan
larsson
took
a
shot
from
the
slot
ranford
gave
a
rebound
to
larsson
who
saw
juhlin
by
the
far
post
passed
the
puck
and
ranford
was
beat
third
period
started
as
the
other
periods
swedes
having
most
of
the
pressure
but
the
canadians
always
dangerous
once
they
were
close
to
the
swede
goal
at
canada
created
some
great
chances
and
arto
blomsten
was
forced
to
cover
the
puck
in
the
swede
goal
crease
since
soderstrom
lost
sight
of
it
that
resulted
in
a
penalty
shot
since
a
defenseman
cant
cover
the
puck
in
the
goal
crease
geoff
sanderson
took
the
penalty
shot
his
first
ever
he
explained
afterwards
and
he
put
it
low
on
soderstroms
stick
side
close
to
the
post
excellent
penalty
shot
to
give
canada
a
go
ahead
goal
canada
increased
the
lead
on
a
very
suspect
offside
gartner
volleyed
a
bouncing
puck
past
soderstrom
to
make
it
the
swedes
ran
out
of
gas
then
and
couldnt
produce
as
good
scoring
chances
as
they
had
for
periods
the
goal
came
with
only
second
left
rod
brindamour
scoring
on
a
rebound
from
soderstrom
where
the
swedish
defense
already
had
their
minds
in
the
dressing
room
a
very
good
game
the
best
in
the
wc
so
far
with
both
goalies
playing
great
soderstrom
best
player
in
sweden
but
ranford
even
played
better
than
soderstrom
that
tells
you
something
about
ranford
probably
the
best
goalie
in
the
world
were
some
comments
after
the
game
canada
played
a
very
disciplined
defense
ranford
pointed
out
that
it
is
easy
to
play
well
with
a
good
defense
lindros
played
a
lot
and
played
well
sanderson
naturally

just
a

hours
before
the
game
he
played
very
well
swedish
coach
curt
lundmark
was
irritated
after
the

partly
because
of
the
swedes
inability
to

partly
because

was
the
abc
coverage
of
the
kingsflames
game
supposed
to
be
the
way
it
was
shown
in
bc
with
cbc
overriding
the
abc
coverage
when
i
flipped
to
abc
it
was
the
same
commentators
same
commercials
even
my
question
is
was
this
the
real
abc
coverage
or
did
cbc
just
black
out
the
abc
coverage
for
its
own
yes
its
called
simulcast
in
canada
when
a
canadian
station
and
an
american
station
are
showing
the
same
thing
whether
a
sporting
event
or
cheers
on
thursday
night
the
canadian
signal
is
broadcast
over
the
american
station
they
even
do
this
during
the
superbowl
which
has
the
best
commercials
of
any
television
what
do
we
get
here
dumb
canadian
commercials
the
same
ones
weve
seen
for
that
last
year
or
so
im
in
edmonton
and
while
thats
usually
or
at
least
often
the
case
here
we
were
treated
to
the
actual

telecast
of
the

im
with

said

earlier
don
witless
er
whitman

not

normally
if

can
someone

shutout
for

hat

for
andreychuk
and
a

for
gilmour

really
lost
how
many

did
whichever
biased
ref
was
at

have

report

joe
montana
is

apparently
montana
is
not

coveted

as

he

in

for

probert
kennedey

primeau
came
out
did
they
move
probert
back
to

why
did
i
see
him
parking
his
ass
in

of
potvin
all
night
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
discipline
probert
if
the
leafs
want
to
win
the
series
perhaps
a
fresh

should
hit
the

whats
going
on
the
russians
and
the
czechs
are
unable
to
beat
easy
opponents

the
swedes
beat
austria
only
its
the

maybe

arrive
late
nervousness
for

wc
players
and
problems
to
get
the
lines
clicking
may
make
things
hard
to
get
it
going
against
these
worse
nations
id
guess
that
the
better
team
you
face
in
the
opening
game
the
better
it
is
since
the
chances
of
an
upset
are
greater
then
some
other
reasons
why
the
worse
teams
are
so
tough
to
beat
was
presented
by
hans
virus
lindberg
former
coach
in
switzerland
the
worse
teams
referring
to
france
switzerland
austria
italy
etc
have
now
usually
world
class
goalies
their
defensive
play
have
become
much
more
disciplined
they
take
much
less
unnecessary
penalties
they
use
four
lines
which
makes
it
harder
to
make
them
run
out
of
gas
the
ice
quality
in
the
german
wc
rinks
is
poor
the
only
convincing
winner
was
germany
wierd
another
weird
thing
was
that
the

played
entertaining

quebec
dominated

for

only
roy
kept
this

from
being

although
he
did
blow
goal
canadians
showed
up
in
third
but
nords
were
playing
dump
pull

most
of
the

do
you
notice
that
nobody
on

team
is
willing
to
take

a

defenceman
would
be
nicetoo
bad
schneider
got
hurt
he
reminds
me
of
chris
chelios
sometimes
speaking
of
chelios
i
wonder
if
serge
savard
feels
like
a
moron
for
making
that
trade
i
also
wish
we
still
had
corson
rob
ramage
on
the
ice
is
less
useful
than
a
gatorade
bottle
on
the
bench
vincent
damphousse
has
decided
to
take
a
vacation
apparently
i
have
no
idea
why
demers
is
playing
denis
savard
on
the
checking
line
with
carbonneau
savard
is
skating
well
and
is
one
of
the
only
dangerous
canadiens
in
quebecs
zone
with
the
puck
too
bad
nobody
is
in
front
most
of
the
time
do
you
also
notice
that
in
the
defensive
zone
not
a
single
nordique
gets
knocked
down
its
disgusting
we
also
have
lebeau
getting
pasted
at
centre
ice
by
wolaninn
with
no
reply
from
the
team
except
to
yell
for
a
penalty
dammit
denis
savard
threw
the
best
only
montreal
hit
of
the
night
when
he
knocked
sundin
offbalance
when
denis
savard
is
your
teams
enforcer
theres
big
trouble
someplace
hextall
made
some
good
saves
but
really
this
one
was
lost
in
first
period
when
nords
scored
could
have
had
plus
another
in
aside
from
that
second
goal
roy
did
stand
on
his
head
the
third
period
at
least
provided
something
to
look
forward
to
habs
won
the
period
imo
and
i
guess
somebody
finally
came
along
to
smack
them
a
couple
of
times
in
the
second
intermission
to
remind
them
that
a
game
had
started
at
hopefully
they
play
that
way
at
home
roy
made
the
saves
well
ignore
that
second
goal

now
its

roy

do

i
would
rather
have
curtis

always
seem

have

would

because
it
was
the

decision
come
on
joe
think
about
what
youre
saying
who
they
played
is
very
significant
why
they
played
them
is
whats
irrelevent
a
low
gaa
against
good
teams
is
better
than
a
low
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the

comparing
two
goaltenders
a
low
gaa
is
better
then
a
higher
gaa
a
low
gaa
against
good
teams
is
much
much
better
than
a
higher
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
lets
start
over
im
not
arguing
about
who
is
the
better
goaltender
id
take
soderstrom
right
now
what
i
am
saying
is
that
roussel
can
be
a
netminder
the
gaa
difference
is
less
than
half
a
goal
per
game
less
than
that
after
last
night
their
save
percentages
are
close
and
their
records
are
similar
and
with
that
i
just
dont
see
how
you
can
label
roussel
as
the
most
disappointing
player
on
the
flyers
this
season
you
say
soderstrom
played
against
better
competition
that
may
very
well
be
but
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
how
roussel
would
have
performed
in
those
games
besides
against
the
better
scoring
teams
like
pittsburgh
the
defense
is
more
keyed
up
than
they
are
against
san
jose
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
scoring
chances
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
you
have
very
little
to
go
by
but
im
not
just
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
ive
seen
him
play
for
the
past
two
seasons
in
philly
and
before
that
in
hershey
its
just
my
opinion
but
i
think
hes
got
what
it
takes
of
course
i
thought
that
about
mark
laforest
too
but
i
never
did
about
wendell
young
so
im
batting
in
judging
hershey
talent
since
the
hextallera
as
for
the
rangers
game
you
can
say
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
by
the
offensive
player
if
you
like
but
rou
had
his
leg
in
position
to
make
the
save
if
he
didnt
it
wouldnt
have
mattered
if
the
rangers
player
didnt
get
the
puck
up
or
not
it
would
have
been
a
goal
on
a
breakaway
thats
what
the
goalie
wants
to
do
take
away
as
much
as
possible
and
force
the
shooter
to
beat
him
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
habs
you
saw
a
goalie
stand
on
his
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
was
a
goalie
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
i
seem
to
remember
roussel
doing
an
excellent
job
against
pittsurgh
on
opening
night
to
give
the
flyers
a
tie
against
the
twotime
defending
champs
and
not
to
take
anything
away
from
soderstrom
because
he
was
senational
in
that
game
agains
the
habs
but
you
cant
tell
me
that
a
montreal
player
had
an
open
net
to
shoot
at
some
point
during
that
game
and
just
flat
out
missed
it
mistakes
both
on
offense
and
defense
are
part
of
the
game
or
thered
never
be
shutouts
anyway
im
happy
the
flyers
have
both
soderstrom
and
roussel
and
im
not
going
to
argue
about
it
anymore
besides
with
the
current
winning
streak
and
expectations
soaring
for
next
year
i
dont
want
to
piss
you
off
to
the
point
that
you

on

on

painted
it
for
him

while
wearing

the

the
biggest
advantage
that
kids
from
boondock

have
is
the
availability
of
ice
in
the
san

area
we
have
a

that

is
served
by
ice
arenas

has
rinks
there
are
also
myriad

that
freeze
in

down
here
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a

up
there
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
pair
of
skates
and
before
you
say
what
does
he
know
hes
from
california
let
me
say
that
i
was
born
and
raised
in
trail
british
columbia
a
town
of
about
with
lots
of
ice
in
the
winter
my
father
did
radio
play
by
play
for
the
local
team
the
trail
smokeaters
who
by
the
way
were
the
last
canadian
team
to
win
the
world
championship
back
in
i
was
on
skates
almost
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
and
have
been
playing
recreational
hockey
for
about
years
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
a
hockey
league
in
the
inner
city
the
insurance
alone
is
a
big
enough
barrier
the
inner
city
isnt
the
only
place
that
is
poor
i
think
the
biggest
barrier
to
hockey
in
the
inner
city
is
no
ice
to
play
on
lack
of
ice
is
a
big
factor
but
costs
is
a
bigger
factor
both
my
kids
play
for
the
santa
clara
valley
hockey
association
and
this
season
which
just
ended
cost
me
per
kid
for
membership
in
hockey
usa
plus
per
kid
for
club
dues
the
hockey
usa
fees
cover
excess
medical
insurance
and
the
club
dues
cover
ice
time
officials
trophies
etc
other
areas
have
similar
fees
unless
the
city
government
subsidises
some
of
the
costs
as
stockton
does
by
the
way
most
ice
arenas
are
located
in
what
could
be
called
the
inner
city
areas
eastridge
and
vallco
are
exceptions
redwood
citys
rink
is
in

fresnos
is
out

just
west
of

rosas
is
a
nice
rink
but
its
in
an
older
section
of
town
dublins
is
outside
of
town
off
most
of
the
rinks
are
old
and
expensive
to
run
with
huge
electric
bills
and
insurance
premiums
if
you
want
to
buy
ice
time
expect
to
pay
around
per
hour
at
any
of
these
rinks
some
of
them
give
you
a
minute
hour
for
your
money
others
give
you
a

and
include
the
resurfacing

jagr
has
a
much
higher

francis
i
can
assure
you
that
i
brought
it
up
as
an
example
of
the
absurdity
of
comparisons
even
on

i
never
ever
thought
that
anyone
would
argue
that
jagrs
higher
actually
reflected
better
twoway
play
in
my
opinion
franciss
low
is
purely
a
result
of
him
being
asked
to
play
against
opponents
top
scorers
at
all
times
the
fact
that
he
can
chip
in
points
while
neutralizing
the
other
teams
top
center
is
a
testament
to
how
valuable
he
is
even
if
his
suffers
on
the
other
hand
jagr
for
how
big
fast
and
skilled
he
is
cant
even
get
points
no
matter
how
inflated
his
is
by
the
way
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
jagr
he
may
be
a
lazy
floater
but
he
turns
it
on
at
exactly
the
right
times
like

he

turned

in

it

left

without

not

it

the

lets
say
that
in

view

the

kisio
was
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
to
fire
feirerra
from
all
indications
it
wasnt
the

factor

the
last
straw
there
were
personality
conflicts
among

disagreements

lost
kingston
which
of

is

a

the

have
been
building
an
organizational

that
is
highly
consensual

cooperative
ferriera
wanted

run

there
were

ferriera
lost
that
says
nothing
about
his

at
that
level
a
lot
is
personality
and
politics
i
think
he
did
some
good
things
for
the
sharks
but
that
he
never
fit
in
as
a
shark
person
i
hope
he
succeeds
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
down
in
anaheim
too
because
itll
be
good
for
hockey

i
want
the

to
be

to
all
bg
hey
i
saw
that

i
thought
the
sabres
looked
better
that
you
bg
described
its
boston
that
looked
weak
and
unsure
of
themselves
even
bg
if
big
if
they
bruins
win
the
third
game
whats
that
going
to
bg
prove
they
be
lucky
well
now
the
sabres
are
up
in
games
and
its
to
bad
that
boston
isnt
putting
up
more
of
a
fight
as
that
could
have
been
the
best
series
of
the
playoffs
i
think
boston
will
come
out
smoking
in
the
next
two
games
and
that
buffalo
will
end
the
series
in
game
six
back
in
buffalo
and
say
how
about
those
islanders
they
are
up
on
the
capitals
and
will
probably
win
the
series
only
to
be
clobbered
by
the
penguins
who
should
eliminate
the
devils
in

next

i

charles

writes
great
write
up
of
the
wingstoronto
series
thus
far
i
agree
with
just
about
everything
that
you
said
but
chevy
shouldnt
have
let
the
shot
from
the
right
point
in
first
goal
mikorov
i
think
other
than
that
the
wings
are
looking
good
and
chevy
is
holding
his
own
not
great
but
maybe
chevy
has
let
in
or
soft
goals
so
far
but
they
all
didnt
matter
however
his
recent
history
has
been
inconsistant
play
but
comes
up
big
when
it
counts
the
score
was
i
think
when
the
goal
you
mentioned
was
scored
in
the
third
period
when
it
looked
like
toronto
was
coming
back
chevy
was
exceptional
i
can
see
him
as
a
barraso
style
playoff
goalie
inconsistant
when
theres
nothing
on
the
line
but
comes
up
big
when
really
needed

tod

in
the
overtime
roy
and
hextall
played
like
they
were
gods
ok
so
montreal
won
they
deserved
it
after
getting
their
first
goal
in
overtime
waved
off
because
the
puck
was
hit
in
with
a
high
stick
their
second
goal
in
overtime
was
also
replayed
but
i
could
not
tell
if
it
was
the
montreal
player
who
kicked
it
in
the
puck
definitely
was
not
directed
in
by
a
stick
anyways
montreal
is
back
into
the
series
the
overhead
replay
pretty
clearly
showed
that
it
was
the
quebec
defender
who
deflected
the
puck
the
replay
officials
did
not
take
nearly
as
much
time
to
make
this
call
as
they
did
for
the
first
nongoal
so
it
seemed
pretty
noncontroversial
i

it
was

see
roy

hopefully
the

bowman
needs
credit
during
the
first
three
games
of
the
pensdevils
series
i
have
been
impressed
time
and
time
again
by
the
pure
talent
of
the
pens
jagr
maceachern
and
barrasso
have
been
especially
fun
to
watch
but
one
element
of
this
team
which
goes
unnoticed
seems
to
be
scotty
bowman
despite
brooks
lunatic
comments
and
despite
the
devils
line
changing
adantage
in
last
nights
game
bowman
has
been
able
to
keep
his
cool
and
keep
the
devils
in
the
dark
granted
the
helldwellers
had
the
pens
bottled
up
for
a
while
last
night
but
bowman
was
eventually
able
to
configure
his
lineup
to
get
the
job
done
his
ability
to
throw
out
new
looks
and
strategies
at
a
moments
notice
is
incredible
bowman
seems
to
have
a
terrific
ability
of
reading
his
players
on
an
individual
basis
last
night
for
instance
he
realized
that
the
speed
of
jagr
straka
and
maceachern
was
throwing
the
devils
off
balance
as
a
result
straka
received
many
more
shifts
than
average
jagr
played
almost
the
entire
game
he
was
always
on
the
puck
and
maceachern
scored
a
goal
while
complementing
jagr
many
times
throughout
the
night
his
ability
to
commit
to
one
player
in
crucial
situations
is
commendable
especially
when
a
coach
of
such
a
talented
team
might
simply
rely
on
the
overall
talent
to
dominate
and
to
bring
about
success
while
no
one
can
replace
the
genius
and
optimism
of
badger

he
should

it
this
is
playoff
hockey
where
anything
goes
you
lose
one
game
in
the
regular
season
and
its
not
so
bad
you
lose
a
game
in
the
playoffs
and
its
a
difficult
thing
to
overcome
ive
watched
hockey
and
played
it
too
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
havent
seen
one
postseason
game
where
the
forward
in
front
of
the
net
has
not
finished
without
any
bruises
on
the
back
of
his
leg
the
leafs
are
not
doing
a
good
job
in
clearing
the
net
and
potvin
has
been
forced
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
i
remember
when
cicarelli
used
to
play
for
the
london
knights
ohl
he
always
was
a
nuisance
in
front
of
the
net
and
the
goalies
took
exception
to
this
he
also
complained
in
this
mornings
paper
about
what
happened
last
night
but
to
me
its
a
lot
of
bellyaching
his
team
is
up
and
he
complains
about
being
whackedi
wonder
what
would
happen
if
he
tried
to
do
the
same
thing
in
front
of
billy
smith
or
a
younger
ron
hextall
seems
dino
would
need
two
artifical
legs
dino
should
take
it
as
part
of
the
game
and
thank
his
lucky
stars
that
hes
in
the
playoffs
and
has
a
good
chance
to
go
the
finals
well
i
agree
that
if
youre
going
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
that
you
should
expect
to
get
hit
and
hacked
at
in
general
you
should
expect
to
finish
the
game
with
some
bruises
however
there
is
a
fine
line
between
hacking
at
a
guy
causing
some
pain
and
discomfort
and
blatantly
attempting
to
injure
another
player
felix
potvin
imo
crossed
that
line
on
wednesday
that
two
hander
on
ciccarelli
was
way
out
of
line
i
lost
a
lot
of
respect
for
potvin
because
of
that
it
showed
an
immaturity
he
did
not
slash
at
ciccarelli
to
simply
try
to
remove
him
from
the
slot
area
a
legal
position
for
dino
to
be
in
instead
he
slashed
in
an
attempt
to
injure
it
was
out
of
shear
frustration
as
a
leaf
supporter
just
a
supporter
im
not
a
leaf
fan
really
i
was
very
disappointed
youre
right
in
mentioning
billy
smith
and
ron
hextall
at
least
in
his
philly
days
they
both
crossed
that
same
line
at
times
and
for
that
reason
many
fans
and
players
disliked
them
thats
why
their
names
always
comes
up
as
examples
when
we
talk
about
these
issues
lets
hope
that
felix
doesnt
do
that
again
id
hate
to
see
anyone
even
dino

i
admit
i
dont
like
him

has

it
happened
in

but
i
cant
tell
you
against
whom
krupp
was
defending
an
opposing
attacker
charging
the
net
it
was
not
krupps
skate
krupp
was
defending
against
steve
tuttle
of
the
blues
they
both
sort
of
tripped
and
fell
toward
malarchuk
and
tuttles
skate
came
perilously
close
to
cutting
but
actually
just
missed
the
jugular
malarchuk
immediately
fell
to
the
ice
hands
at
his
neck
blood
on
the
ice
malarchuk
became
the
fourth
goalie
behind
hasek
puppa
and
draper
after
suffering
from
obsessivecompulsive
disorder
hes
been
playing
in
san
diego
for
former
sabre
coach
rick
dudley
hed
been
suffering
from
it
for
over
a
decade
he
just
wasnt
diagnosed
for
it
until
he
didnt
sleep
for
ten
days
and
decided
to
have
some
alcohol
to
help
him
sleep
unfortunately
hed
just
been
put
on
ulcer
medicine
a
few
days
earlier
its
amazing
he
lasted
as
long
as
he
did
ocd
sufferers
stop
distinguishing
the
line
between
reality
and
imagination
or
fail
to
accept
that
something
theyve
checked
is
ok
now
for
example
an
ocd
sufferrer
can
wash
his
hands
over
and
over
and
still
think
theyre
dirty
he
might
check
the
oven
ten
times
to
be
sure
its
turned
off
he
might
see
a
movie
about
something
and
automatically
assume
the
situation
is
the
same
for
his
own
life
malarchuk
has
dramatically
decreased
the
medicine
he
takes
but
still
needs
it
he
went
off
it
this
past
winter
and
had
a
bad
ocd
episode
and
i
think
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
couple
days
he
felt
it
slowed
his
reflexes
so
he
tried
to
go
without
in
any
event
he
is
alive
and
well
and
living
in
san
diego
while
playing
with

ihl
krupp
is
now

pens
that
would
be

it
was
speculated
at
the
time
that
the
injury
was
so
serious
that
had
he
been
playing
at
the
other
end
of
the
rink
at
the
time
he
was
playing
in
the

end
as
the
ambulence
is
parked
he
never
would
have
survived
ditto
if
he
were
playing
anything
other
than
a
league
with
an
ambulance
on
standby
if
youve
seen
video
tape
of
the
incident
it
is
amazing
how
much
blood
there
was
it
was
literally
spurting
out
all
over
the
ice
as
clint
grabbed
his
neck
and
watched
the
puddle
in
horror
amazingly
enough
he
made
a
full
recovery
and
played
again
in
the
nhl
he
was
getting
on
in
years
at
the
time
of
the
incident
anyway
and
didnt
play
for
too
long
afterward
some
people
speculated
that
he
just
couldnt
get
himself
back
together
after
the
incident
and
i
think
he
had
a
bunch
of
other
personal
problems
dogging
him
afterward
he
did
eventually
get
back
to
form
and
played
another
year
or
so
after
that
and
then
i
believe
he
retired
anyone

deleted
randy
graca
seems
to
think
murray
is
the
best
gm
in
the
league
i
think
quinn
is
one
of
several
who
are
better
plus
his
team
quinns
has
improved
a
much
greater
amount
than
detroit
since
he
took
over
with
them
how
do
you
figure
both
vancouver
and
detroit
did
the
same
thing
last
year
they
both
won
their
division
they
had
close
to
the
same
number
of
points
they
both
went
down
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
before
finally
escaping
in
games
and
they
both
got
knocked
out
in
the
second
round
by
teams
they
should
have
been
able
to
beat
with
less
talent
specifically
if
i
remember
correctly
third
place
teams
how
does
this
make
vancouver
more
improved
further
if
im
not
mistaken
the
wings
had
more
points
than
vancouver
at
the
end
of
this
season
albeit
not
many
when
quinn
took
over
vancouver
several
years
ago
not
last
year
they
regularily
missed
the
playoffs
i
cant
recall
if
they
missed
the
playoffs
the
year
before
his
hiring
but
they
probably
did
quinn
has
improved
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibre
to
a
serious
contender
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
was
a
contender
to
win
the
norris
division
and
possibly
even
a
stanley
cup
contender
so
quinn
has
improved
his
team
more
than
murray
has
since
taking
over
as
a
gm
quinn
is
one
example
of
a
better
gm

i
cant
recall
if
they
missed
the
playoffs
the
year
before
his
hiring
but
they
probably
did
quinn
has
improved
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibre
to
a
serious
contender
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
was
a
contender
to
win
the
norris
division
and
possibly
even
a
stanley
cup
contender
the
last
year
before
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wings
did
not
make
the
playoffs
while
they
had
been
considered
a
possible
contender
when
jacques
demers
first
arrived
in
his
last
two
years
they
were
respectively
embarrassed
in
the
first
round
by
chicago
and
then
failed
to
make
the
playoffs
at
a
time
a
might
add
when
there
were
only
five
teams
in
the
norris
its
true
that
vancouver
did
not
make
the
playoffs
for
many
a
year
before
quinn
came
but
in
those
years
the
smythe
division
was
a
loti
mean
a
lot
tougher
division
than
the
norris
also
known
as
the
snorris
division
vancouver
had
to
play
edmonton
and
calgary
both
very
legitimate
stanley
cup
contenders
eight
times
a
year
while
detroit
got
to
play
such
powerhouses
as
toronto
and
minnesota
now
edmonton
is
hardly
even
a
force
in
the
league
and
the
smythe
even
has
the
mighty
san
jose
sharks
while
over
this
same
period
of
time
in
which
vancouver
was
improving
so
was
everybody
in
the
norris
except
st
louis
detroit
had
to
improve
just
to
keep
up
with
the
competition
in
their
division
they
had
to
improve
a
lot
to
get
better
than
their
competition
in
the
norris
bryan
murray
inherited
a
team
with
very
little
talent
for
really
good
players
they
had
yzerman
burr
and
probert
and
that
was
about
it
and
no
doubt
some
will
dispute
whether
burr
and
probert
were
that
good
the
rest
were
either
very
green
rookies
or
washed
up
veterans
the
only
reason
they
got
as
far
as
they
did
in
the
years
before
murray
came
was
due
to
the
coaching
of
demers
who
at
least
at
first
got
every
last
ounce
of
effort
possible
out
of
his
team
then
even
his
coaching
began
to
degrade
so
quinn
has
improved
his
team
more
than
murray
has
since
taking
over
as
a
gm
quinn
is
one
example
of
a
better
gm
than
murray
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
detroit
wasnt
in
as
bad
a
shape
standings
wise
when
murray
took
over
as
vanc
was
when
quinn
took
over
some
of
which
i
outlined
above
but
murray
did
not
have
any
better
personnel
to
work
with
at
the
outset
than
did
quinn
with
the
exception
of
yzerman
and
one
player
cannot
alone
make
a
team
into
a
stanley
cup
contender
as
im
sure
everyone
reading
this
will
agree
well
be
able
to
see
better
which
team
is
really
the
most
improved
when
they
face
each
other
in
the
conference
final
assuming
they
dont
get
knocked

mario

that

has

do
is
fall
on
the

the

guy
to
him
gets
at

last
night
in
the
game
between
nj
and

he
was
being
pushed
while
skating
across
the
front
of
the
goal
while
trying
to
get
a
shot
off
the
guy
on
him
was
doing
a
good
job
so
he
got
off
a
weak
shot
but
then
he
decided
to
fall
to
the
ice
then
the
fucking
refvan
helloamend
called
the
guy
for
holding
they
replayed
the
play
and
my
roomatewho
is
clueless
about
hockey
wanted
to
know
what
the
nj
guy
did
to
get
a
call
because
it
was
so
fucking
obvious
the
nj
player
had
both
hands
on
his
stick
and
no
he
did
not
trip
him
it
is
simple
mario
gets
touched
he
falls
to
the
ice
automatic
but
the
thing
that
really
pissed
me
off
is
pitt
scored
the
or
goal
i
dont
remember
on
the
resulting
pp
and
eventually
won
his
divingcalls
makes
a
huge
difference
in
the
outcome
of
a
game
they
gotta
stop
the
damn
holding
and
interference
that
is
so
fucking
obvious
that
is
not
hockey
it
allows
inferior
players
to
bring
down
the
level
of
the
better
players
and
allows
inferior
teams
to
beat
better
ones
this
has
pissed
me
off
for
many
years
now
and
it
has
improved
somewhat
however
during
the
playoffs
and
periods
the
damn
refs
must
misplace

there

with
the

the

i
feel
that
geographical

enhance
regional
loyalties
more
than
names
honouring

i
think
a
compromise
would
work
namely
honouring

in
conference

using
geographical
references
in
the
divisional
names
although
i
still
do

its

it

either
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
points
system
percentages
as
used
in
the
other
major
sports
are
clearly
more
informative
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
standings
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calculation
to
account
for
games
in

which
is
almost
always
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentages
claiming
perhaps
that
it
is
an
americanization
of
the
sport

i
agree
totally
the
points
system
is
fine

everybody
at

has
played
the

of
games

they

they
were

and
we
couldnt
see
the

apparently
they
received
enough

so
they
waited

cutting
away
their

well
i
think
whenever
espn
covers
the

they
do
a
wonderful
job
but
what
i
dont
understand
is
that
they
cut
the
ot
just
show
some
stupid
baseball
news
which
is
not
important
at
all
then
i
waited
for
the
scores
to
comeon

but
they
talk
about
baseball
basketball
and

then
they
showed

and
went
back
to
stupid
basketball
finally
they
showed
a
highlight
of
the
ot
goal
but
that
was
like
sec
i
think
they
should
give
more
attention
to

then
talking

boring
basketball

i
guess
it
is

this

seems

be

something
to
his

boston
which
sweeney
you
askwell
of

bob
sweeney
the
one
that
boston
let
buffalo
get
a
hold
of
they
still
have
sweeneys
which
makes
things
slightly
confusing
game
winner
in
ot
in

and
another
big
goal
seconds
after
fuhr
made

blank
saves
this
is
why
grant
has
rings
to
put
buffalo
ahead
in
the
yes
neely
countered
a
minute
later
but
hadnt
this
course
of
buffalo
going
ahead
after
being
tied
and
shutting
down
another
few
great
scoring
opportunities
i
think
boston
would
have
notched
their
first
win
of
the
series
well
the
sabres
havent
made
it
to
the
end
of
this
series
yet
but
i
certainly
feel
theyve
got
boston
right
were
they
want
themactually
theyve
got
them
in
a
position
that
neither
buffalo
nor
boston
felt
that
would
come
about
one
more
astronomical
game
by
fuhr
a
few
more
heroics
by
the
rest
of
the
team
this
is
a
team
sport
afterall
and
i
think
borque

weather

real

happen

talking

that
a

swing
golf
swing

baseball
swing
that
hawerchuck
used
in
the
last
shot
of
the
game
that
khmylev
deflected
in
for
the
big
one
the
whole
ot
all
minute
of
it
was
a
tesiment
to
buffalos
ability
to
really
be
persistent
and
grind
it
out
in
the
end
something
they
werent
necessarily
in
the
regular
season
the
sabres
pushed
hard
and
forced
borque
to
blatently
take
down
bodger
in
the
opening
seconds
i
dont
normally
like
penalties
being
called
in
such
ultracritical
points
but
this
was
blatent
finally
the
sabres
won
a
faceoff
they
werent
that
hot
in
this
dept
the
rest
of
the
game
when
lafontaine
scooped
at
the
puck
times
when
hawerchuck
took
his
shot
quite
a
boomer
but
blue
stopped
this
one
he
took
a
few
steps
over
to
get
his
own
rebound
and
slapped
at
it
again
without
setting
it
up
i
didnt
realize
it
went
in
until
the

started
screaming
they

at

last

there
was

the

didnt
have
it
wrapped
up
before
the
game
was
half
over
like
the
previous
two
games
im
not
sure
if
nj
just
rose
up
and
played
better
or
if
the

just
started
to
play
down
somewhat
probably
it
was
somewhere
in

new

seemed
much
more
aggressive
last

in
the

end
they
did
much
more
swarming
around
which
at

kept
an
element
of

in
the

no

that
billington
helped
make
it
more

also
claude

didnt

johnson
on

was

both

have

another

how
can
you
argue

playing

on

however
i
do
believer
they
need
to
pick
up
some
players
who
will
add
toughness
to
the
team
but
you
have
to
remember
that
youre
unlikely
to
get
any
real
quality
free

who
do
not
require
compensation
the
sharks
tried
with
makarov
who
was
probably
the
top
of
the
class
among
noncompensation
free
agents
but
even
he
probably
wouldnt

too

dont

to

just
some

i

mcgillhammond
johan
garpenlov
would
you
really
rather
have
those
two
instead
of
johan
by
your
logic
then
you
enjoy
having
falloon
and
ozolinsh
on
injured
reserve
by
your
logic
then
you
think
that
if
the
sharks
had
kept
mcgill
and
hammond
that
you
can
guarantee
that
falloon
and
ozolinsh
wouldnt
have
gotten
hurt
think
again
there
was
a
chance
that
mcgill
would
have
caused
ozolinsh
to
get
stuck
at
kc
and
as
you
know
hammond
is
worthless
and
mcgill
is
almost
worthless
well
wilson
maybe
but
i
dont
think
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
really
injured
on
cheapshots
who
said
they
were
if
they
werent
then
i
dont
see
any
justification
that
having
mcgill
and
hammond
around
would
prevent
their
injuries
if
the
injuries
of
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
purely
accidental
then
what
could
mcgill
and
hammond
have
done
to
prevent
them
hey
get
off
the
mcgillhammond
thing
im
no
fan
of
either
my
point
is
that
last
year
the
sharks
had
toughness
that
was
missing
this
year
this
year
we
had
more
skill
im
all
for
that
but
if
your
skill
players
keep
getting
beat
up
and
injured
they
cant
do
you
much
good
whether
its
a
cheap
shot
or
not
you
cant
let
the
other
teams
push
you
around
the
sharks
simply
got
pushed
around
to
much
other
teams
knew
this
they
knew
they
could
aggressively
check
the
sharks
and
not
pay
for
it
adding
some
players
in
the
off
season
who
will
add
some
toughness
to
the
team
will
help
insure
that
next
season
other
teams
will
be
more
hesistant
to
vigorously
check
our
skill
players
or
to
take
cheap
shots
it
doesnt
guarantee
no

does

is
the

in

altogether
instead
of

its

is

if
a
player
is
on

when
his

scores
a

and
only
allows

he
must
be

right
it
is

as
they
play

and
should

roughly
similar

if

degrees
of
success
to
compare
between
players
on

i
agree
it
would
be
nice
for
the
nhl
to
keep
more
statistics
but
how
useful
are
the
ones
that
you

total

the

am
sick
at
the
abundance
of
talent
that
has
been
totally
untapped
and
the
lack
of
heart
displayed
this

i
have
some
final
questions
about
the
way
the
team
was
handled
in
that
last
dreadful
stretch
knowing
they
needed
offensive
help
from
the
blueline
why
didnt
we
see
mike

who
played
pretty
well
when
he
was
called
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
hurlbut
was
injured
for
quite
a
while
im
not
sure
but
i
think
he
may
have
recovered
in
time
for
the
playoff
run
and
if
so
like
you
question
why
he
wasnt
used
why
is
joe
kocur
playing
every
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
i
believe
kocur
was
used
in
many
instances
for
his
intimidation
factor
granted
he
seemed
to
get
an
awful
lot
of
ice
time
for
that
reason
alone
but
you
have
to
realize
that
when
a
team
is
not
doing
any
real
physical
intimidation
id
like
to
have
a
nickel
for
every

how
come
paul
broten
is
relegated
to
street
clothes
for
the
end
of

at
least
he
plays
with
some
heart
and
character
draws
penalties
and
plays
when
hes
on
the
ice
was
he
in
the
doghouse
for
some
reason
i
agree
and
i
dont
know
joe
cirella
enough
said
sorry
i
dont

c
did
a

filling

was
asked
to
i
cant
imagine
that
its
easy
going
from

to

i
dont
seem
to
remember
him
turning
the
puck
over
at
the
blue
line
too
much
or
failing
to
clear
the
zone
he
worked
hard
and
at

didnt
make
any
rookie
mistakes
as
he
said
himself
in

he
can
only
give

they
had

the

game
goes
into

but
due

contractual
obligations
they
have
to
switch
to
the

sorry
for

what
the

going

do

they
do
a

last

i
felt
the

i
really
hate
watching

everyone
knows
that

are
going

kicked
why
even
bother
showing

i
was

bored
and
these

dont
seem

have
any

after
the

games
they
are
still
going

eight

murray
inherited
a
team
with
very
little
talent
for
really
good
players
they
had
yzerman
burr

probert
and
that
was
about
it
and
no

some
will
dispute
whether
burr
and
probert
were
that
good
the
rest
were
either
very
green
rookies
or
washed
up
veterans
the
only
reason
they
got
as
far
as
they
did
in
the
years
before
murray
came
was
due
to
the
coaching
of
demers
who
at
least
at
first
got
every
last
ounce
of
effort
possible
out
of
his

with
at

than
did
quinn
with

that
a

there
was
talk
that
both
bimidgi

mankato
state
trying

upgrade
their
programs
to

i
also
seem
to
remember
that
they
had
some
trouble
with
new
ncaa
rule
about
just
who
was
allowed
to
compete
at
the
div

was
that
ever
resolved
also
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
is
any
college
hockey
east
of
colorado
alaska
excepted
with
the
new
popularity
of
hockey
on

i
would

there
to

building
at

i
dont

trading

was
intrinsically
a

however
trading
him
for
a
round
pick
would
be
he
should
have
been
worth
a
lot
more
than
a
round
pick
for
a
playoff
team
in
fact
i
would
intimate
that
the
offers
the
sharks
got
this
year
for
kisio
were
way
greater
than
just
a
round
pick
hindsights
nobody
expected
kisio
to
have
his
best
career
year
besides
without
kisio
the
sharks
would
have
tanked
even
earlier
in
the
season
and
gund
might
have
gotten
a
little
more
serious
about
getting
joe
murphy
a
guy
who
definitely
would
be
around
years
from
now
when
the
sharks
do
make
the
playoffs
what
else
could
be
done
the
gunds
offered
million
for
murphy
but
the
oilers
wanted
prospects
which
the
sharks
declined
to
give
which
i
think
is
correct
i
didnt
mean
to
imply
that
gunds
offer
wasnt
enough
gunds
offer
was
the
right
but
too
late
in
the
season
offered
in
november
lets
sather
buy
a
replacement
for
murphy
this
season
and
make
the
playoffs
this
year
in
march
doesnt
help
sather
with
his
immediate
objectives
doesnt
help
with
long
term
objectives
only
a
prospect
or
draft
pick
does
and
no
way
should
the
sharks
do
that
however
getting
back
to
whatif
games
had
kisio
been
traded
to
chicago
last
year
then
the
sharks
go
for
october
and
maybe
gund
panicks
sooner
in
november
and
heres
another
whatif
twist
chicago
would
have
had
kisio
this
season
they
never
go
after
murphy
in
the
first
place
because
kelly
is
having
his
best
season
bigger
guys
in
chicago
so
gund
has
no
competition
so
ferriera
sather
and
keenan
all
look
like
geniuses
a
broken
fax
machine
and
ferriera
keenan
and
maybe
kingston
and
maybe
even
green
lose
their
jobs
kind
of
makes
you
shiver
doesnt
it
bottomline
for
every
black
scenario
any
of
you
can
concoct
for
kisio
leaving
i
can
concoct
an
equally
bright
one
if
the
kisiofiasco
was
the
cause
of
ferierras
down
fall
i
hope
it
wasnt
because
he
tried
to
trade
kisio
but
because
he
screwed
it
up
nonetheless
im
sorry
ferierra
and
kingston
are
gone
and
i
wish
gund
would
follow
and
what
have
the
gunds
done
exactly
that
caused
you
to
wish
that
they
were
gone
are
you
serious
let
ferierra
go

whether

from

someone
surely
is
getting

him
somehow

my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on

net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
well
here
in
detroit
we
get
to
see
and
hear
don
cherry
quite
regularly
the
detroit
area
picks
up
hockey
night
in
canada
from
cbc
ch
in
windsor
where
we
see
don
cherrys
coaches
corner
between
periods
we
also
get
to
see
don
cherrys
grapevine
just
before
the
game
the
grapevine
is
a
hockey
talk
show
where
don
talks
to
a
player
or
coach
about
what
else
hockey
its
actually
a
pretty
good
show
and
don
isnt
as
annoying
as
he
is
on
coaches
corner
i
think
this
is
were
don
got
his
nickname
grapes
but
im
not
sure
don
use
to
coach
the
boston
bruins
i
dont
know
exactly
when
that
was
could
someone
fill
me
in
on
this
info
a
local
radio
station
here
in
detroit
wllz
talks
to
don
every
tuesday
morning
personally
ive
had
my
fill
of
donny
he
really
pisses
me
off
sometimes
during
the
detroittoronto
game
monday
night
on
cbc
don
gave
high
praise
to
doug
gilmour
saying
he
was
a
twoway
player
and
not
just
a
designated
goal
scorer
and
that
he
is
probably
the
best
player
in
the
game
because
of
that
thats
fine
and
i
agree
that
gilmour
is
a
good
twoway
player
but
he
said
the
exact
same
thing
about
yzerman
about
a
month
ago
on
a
local
radio
talk
show
what
gives
it
seems
like
he
just
has
a
set
speech
that
he
changes
when
he
goes
from
city
to
city
don
cherry
i
think
insert
star
player
name
for
city
that
he
is
in
is
the
best
twoway
player
in
the
league
today
there
have
been
other
times
cant
remember
exactly
what
he
said
that
he
basically
changed
his
opinions
to
match
the
audience
he
was
talking
to
someone
here
on
the
net
said
something
about
how
don
criticized
mario
lemieux
but
when
the
time
comes
for
don
to
broadcast
the
cup
playoffs
from
the
civic

yes
i
think
the
pens
will
make
it
out
of
the

conference
don
will
apologize
left

right
for

about

in

it

much

atlantas

has
declined
to

games

and
even
when

on
and
they
will
continue
to
skip
the

half
hour
of
the
telecast
i
know
this
is
still
a
better
situation
compared
to
rest
of
georgia

etc
but
it
is
still
pretty
annoying
at
least
in
pittsburgh
we
had
a
network
preemptionchannel
which
showed
all
netwoork
shows
prempted
by
the
local
affiliate
i
asked
them
what
their
problem
was
i
told
them
that
a
local
rating
was
not
that
bad
considering
it
was
the
first
nhl
game
shown
after
a
long
time
without
much
promotion
besides
their
syndicated
programming
in
the
afternoon
is
usually
low
rated
so
what
did
they
have
to
lose
by
showing
nhl
playoffs
she
told
me
that
they
had
contractual
obligations
i
asked
her
if
golf
was
shown
oin
abc
would
contractual
obligations
come
in
the
way
and
how
come
contractual
obligations
didnt
come
in
the
way
of
last
weeks
telecast
she
then
couldnt
give
me
a
coherent
answer
also
i
added
that
atlanta
had
one
of
the
highest
neutral
site
game
attendances
and
that
the
demographics
were
good
i
think
abc
and
other
networks
should
begin
to
tie
their
high
rated
programs
like
roseanne
in
with
thier
sports
programming
i
hope
that
everyone
in
atlanta
who
reads
this
bboard
calls
wsb
and
complain
bitterlyt
about
this
tell
them
you
will
stop
watching
their
news
telecasts
since
they
seem
to
be
very
unprofessional
in
handling
this
situation
the
lady
did
not

settle
on

someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
for
those
of
you
who
complain
about
don
cherry
and
wonder
why
he
is
popular
the

howard

john
madden
picks

clark

a

over
much
better

much
the
same
reasons
cherry
sings
the
praises

doug

little

with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string

saying
that

madden

his

dick
vitale
is
always
promoting
this
kid
from

why
should
americans
expect
that

have
such

our
greatest
passionwhich
is

re
bowman
needs
credit
however
bowman
is
really
not
a
modern
coach
and
patricks
solution
of
having
him
only
run
the
team
on
game
days
and
delegate
most
of
the
daytoday
responsibity
to
the
assistants
is
a
shrewd
managerial
decision
on
patricks
part
i
would
argue
gerald
that
bowman
is
the
first
modern
coach
bowmans
canadiens
were
the
first
nhl
team
to
have
a
weightroom
in
the
he
is
the
first
coach
i
have
seen
that
manipulates
the
press
into
spreading
false
game
plan
rumours
during
important
games
listen
to
the
pregame
interview
will
bowman
and
compare
that
to
what
is
on
the
ice
i
agree
bowman
is
a
master
of
the
lineups
remember
last
year
in
the
sc
when
he
benched
jagr
only
to
set
him
free
in
ot
when
jagr
banged
in
the
winning
goal
i
thought
this
was
trademark
bowman
and
also
a
sign
of
a
modern
coach
i
am
left
asking
what
is
a
modern
coach
if
not
bowman

i
dont

this
at
all
roy
was
the
reason
the

was

and
that
would
not

been
the
case
had
dionne
kept
his

stood
on
his
head
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
game
when
the
nords
were
rushing
from
endtoend
kamenskys
minibreak
after
the
tying
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excellent
chances
stopped
by
roy
roy
outplayed
hextall
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becomes
the
villain
and
hextall
the
hero
because
roys
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportunities
whoa
what
you
are
effectively
doing
is
implying
that
if
a
player
plays
really
well
he
stores
up
mistakes
that
can
be
used
at
a
later
time
ths
is
not
so
roy
is
the
villain
as
you
so
succinctly
put
it
because
he
allowed
a
very
cheap
goal
if
you
think
roy
outplayed
hextall
perhaps
you
should
get
a
tape
of
the
game
and
watch
the
first
minutes
of
the
third
period
nhl
goaltenders
make
some
great
saves
if
they
did
not
they
would
not
be
in
the
nhl
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
expect
any
particular
goalie
to
be
able
to
make
the
great
saves
all
of
the
time
even
though
they
are
occasionally
required
however
when
it
comes
to
a
routine
shot
like
sakics
especially
at
such
a
crucial
time
in
a
game
i
dont
think
there
are
any
legitimate
excuses
hextall
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucky
bounces
description
of
lucky
bounces
hextall
wasnt
particularly
brilliant
on
those
plays
i
am
not
arguing
that
hextall
was
brilliant
i
am
arguing
is
that
a
relatively
weak
wrist
shot
from
the
outside
of
the
circle
shold
not
result
in
a
goal
but
it
was
just
the
goal
the
timing
stank
but
against
an
explosive
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportunity
too
many
with
a
powerplay
that
was
totally
unnecessary
in
a
onegoal
game
with
less
than
a
minute
to
go
there
is
no
such
thing
as
just
the
goal
i
have
not
defended
dionne
for
taking
the
penalty
eitherin
fact
i
think
it
was
a
boneheaded
move
but
it
led
to
one
goal
only
and
montreal
had
a
two
goal
lead
my
main
concern
is
the
second
goal
this
most
certainly
was
a
team
loss
leclair
missed
his
opportunities
as
did
bellows
and
brunet
dionne
took
a
bad
penalty
damphousse
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
means
can
be
singled
out
for
this
loss
what
you
say
about
the
skaters
is
absolutely
true
but
realize
that
the
game
was
effectively
won
you
could
watch
any
hockey
game
in
fact
you
could
watch
any
sporting
event
period
and
spend
hours
discussing
the
what
ifs
wrt
missed
opportunities
they
are
not
important
when
the
final
result
is
decided
if
i
get
the
time
soon
ill
watch
the
game
again
and
email
you
a
list
of
lucky
montreal
bounces
and
a
list
of
quebec
offensive
screwups
montreal
was
leading
with
a
minute
to
go
the
goalie
is
the
last
line
of
defence
and
i
will
grant
that
extra
attention
is
focussed
on
him
sometimes
without
justification
but
roy
gave
up
a
lousy
goal
and
a
team
cannot
afford
such
a
goal
roy
looked
like
a
player
in
an
industrial
league
on
sakics
shot
and
hextall
didnt
on
dionnes
goal
please
who
cares
of
what
value
is
it
to
justify
one
lousy
play
with
a
totally
unrelated
lousy
play
i
could
do
a
hextall
critique
if
youd
like
but
if
youre
going
to
assess
his
performance
keep
in
mind
that
he
made
the
key
saves
at
the
key
times
roy
is
paid
big
money
because
that
is
his
value
compared
to
other
goalies
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
for
the
record
i
did
not
say
that
roy
was
not
one
of
the
top
goaltenders
in
the
league
in
fact
i
agree
that
he
is
the
montreal
media
is
the
quickest
to
heap
praise
and
then
hurl
derogatory
comments
against
the
habs
they
are
no
better
than
uninformed
fans
i
assume
you
are
referring
to
me
however
i
have
pointed
out
that
i
think
the
loss
can
be
blamed
on
roy
i
have
not
said
he
sucks
nor
do
i

ive
made
any

espn
cares
less
about

espn
is
pathetic
i
have
been
watching
everybody
complain
about
espns
coverage
and
i
agree
with
all
of
you
might
i
suggest
that
we
are
getting
all
worked
up
over
nothing
we
all
knew
that
espns
coverage
was
going
to
suck
i
mean
have
you
ever
watched
during
the
regular
season
sportscenter
coverage
of
hockey
it
sucks
i
mean
really
sucks
espn
does
not
know
hockey
if
it
shot
them
in
the
ass
i
was
really
pissed
of
about
last
night
coverage
i
go
to
school
in
ohio
i
know
the
indians
suck
so
why
show
them
if
i
were
bill
clement
i
would
shoot
myself
anyway
after
i
calmed
down
after
i
realized
that
they
were
not
going
to
show
overtime
of
the
caps
isles
game
i
thought
to
myself
i
knew
that
this
was
going
to
happen
in
fact
i
remerbed
myself
praying
that
at
least
they
would
keep
even
the
boring
devils
game
overall
i
think
espn
does
not
care
if
they
show
hockey
or
not
and
i
firmly
belive
that
they
have
know
respect
for
the
fans
ie
because
of
contract
obligations

tiebreaker
in

lorie
writes
according
to
the
hockey
gurus
over
at
espn
should
the
islanders
win
tonite
the
two
teams
will
have
the
same
record
but
the
devils
will
be
playing
the
penguins
this
is
because
the
islanders
have
won
the
season
series
against
the
devils
i
think
the
rules
for
deciding
a

breaker
include

william

writes
as
a
person
who
has
rarely
even
seen
don
cherry
and
doesnt
know
anything
about
him
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his
broadcasts
or
whether
hes
a
canadian
thing
altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
hes
a
canadian
thing
former
coach
of
the
boston
bruins
and
colorado
rockies
from
the
summaries
that
get
posted
i
gather
that
his
ongoing
beef
this
year
has
been
the
conventional
wisdom
that
canadian
hockey
is
doomed
to
be
second
or
third
rate
behind
the
perceived
emergence
of
the
us
and
european
programs
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
after
he
left
the
rockies
he
got
a
job
with
cbcs
hockey
night
in
canada
and
hasnt
looked
back
since
actually
he
did
work
for
cbc
at
least
on
playoff
season
after
the
rockies
were
eliminated
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
id
say
its
a
combination
of
flame
bait
and
serious
journalism
the
closest
thing
youll
find
to
cherry
in
the
us
is
stan
fischler
a
selfdescribed
hockey
maven
the
similarities
are
that
they
both
say
things
that
get
people
upset
the
difference
is
that
cherry
knows
the
game
and
fischler
doesnt
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
dons
a
character
if
he
were
completely
rational
and
noncontroversial
he
wouldnt
have
a
job
by
some
definitions
he
could
be
called
an
ass
but
then
some
people
feel
the
same
about
mike
lang
another
character
that
i
wish
would
get
wider
exposure
only
one
national
telecast
last
year
mike
eisler
mreengsuncom
not
only
are
they
leafs
the
best
team
but
their
fans
are
even
more
intelligent
and
insightful
than
pittsburghs
their
players
are
mighty
bright
too
i
mean
he
really
was
going
to
get
his
wallet
back

a

players
in

that
wouldnt

at
the
highest
level

still
valuable
role
players
however
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
wow
now
it
looks
like
you
dont
like
our
players
what
about
guys
like
nieminen
jutila
riihijarvi
varvio
laukkanen
makela
keskinen
and
even
if
he
is
aging
ruotsalainen
the
main
difference
between
finnish
and
north
american
players
is
that
our
players
tend
to
be
better
in
the
larger
rink
the
canadian
defenders
are
usually
slower
that
defenders
in
europe
and
i
think
that
there
was
more
in
our
success
than
ketterer
and
luck
though
they
helped
i
think
that
the
main
reason
was
that
the
team
worked
well
together
thats
true
game
is
so
different
here
in
europe
compared
to
nhl
northame
ricans
are
better
in
small
rinks
and
europeans
in
large
rinks
an
average
european
player
from
sweden
finland
russian
or
tsechslovakia
is
a
better
skater
and
puckhandler
than
his
nhl
colleague
especially
defenders
in
nhl
are
mainly
slow
and
clumsy
selnne
has
also
said
that
in
the
finnish
smleague
game
is
more
based
on
skill
than
in
nhl
in
finland
he
couldnt
get
so
many
breakaways
because
defenders
here
are
an
average
much
better
skaters
than
in
nhl
also
alpo
suhonen
said
that
in
nhl
selnnes
speed
accentuates
because
of
clumsy
defensemen
i
have
to
admit
that
the
best
players
come
from
canada
but
those
regulars
arent
as
skilful
as
regulars
in

i
watched
the

in

todayand
i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
it
was
not
just
those
penalties
most
of
all
it
was
the
penalty
the
referee
didnt
call
on
the
czechs
right
before
their
first
goal
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
dont
you
think
its
quite
silly
to
call
it
a
nazi
attitude
when
some
people
throw
coins
on
the
ice
hey
i
dont
approve
the
behavior
of
these
guys
especially
not
in
a
wc
game
but
i
cant
see
any
reason
for
using
the
word
nazi
in
this
connection
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every
possible
sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
soccer
hooligans
are
not
just
a
german
problem
remember
the
world
cup
in
italy
again
theres
a
big
difference
between
throwing
coins
and
smashing
shopwindows
or
fighting
with
other
socalled
fans
who
come
to
a
wc
just
to
see
if
the
dutch
or
the
english
or
the
germans
are
the
best
bruisers
which
other
sports
are
you
talking
about
i
dont
think
soccer
is
every
possible
sport
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
how
many
germans
do
you
know
do
you
think
out
of
is
most
of
them
if
you
hear
about
some
white
policemen
beating
a
black
man
in

what
do
you
think
about

most
of

was
being
fired
on

in

i

they
even
missed
one

completely
because
they
were
showing
two
guys
holding
each

in

the

their

what

they
should

there

no

for

vukota
is
absolutely
the
worst
puck
handler
in

he
couldnt
hit
a
bull
in

with

al
must
remember
a

years
back
when
mick
scored
goals
in

period
against
the
caps
in

win
i
was
there
and
was
astonished
as
was
the
rest

wakeup
al
years
later
hes
gotten
worse
hes
a
cheap

artist
and
always
ends
up
getting
stupidsenseless
penalties
i
think
he
would
make
a
good
police

as
for
pilon
he
cant
carry
the
puck
out

center
ice
by
himself
he
either
makes

in

turnover

he
attempts

bring
the
puck
towards
the
neutral
zone
and
skates
right
into

he

he
either
falls
down

committs
a

call
up
somebody
from

the

are

figure
out

the
caps
two
good
teams
with
talent
but
so
inconsistent
they
should
meet
in
the
first
round
the
isles
seem
to
play
up
to
the
level
of
their
competition
so
they
should
play
well
against
jersey
tonite
itll
probably
be
another
tight
game
as
the
last
games
hve
been
for

i
wish
when

they
could
continue
to
pour
it
on
instead
of
settling
back
into
a

shell
and
letting

get
back
in

al
must

i

will
keep
plugging
away
until
they
hit
the
right
formula
for
yet
another
cup
whereas
if
i

id
have
this

not

the

you

it
definitely
needs

a

example
is
if

the
penguins
individual
you
will
find
very
few
minuses
that
only
makes
common
sense
since
they
didnt
lose
many
games
until
the
nhl
publishes
a
more
useful
quantifiable
statistic
including
ice
time
per
game
and
some
measure
of
its
quality
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situations
like
protecting
a
lead
late
in
the
game
is
he
matched
up
against
the
other

top
one

two
lines
shorthanded

dave
i
would

with
you
there
satan
himself
could
own
the

and
id
be
happy
as
long
as
the
oilers
stayed
in
edmonton
selfish

true
i
dont
want
to
see
the
oilers
move
no
matter
who
their
owner
is
bart
bartsplungeuucp
or
bartonaitabca
i
too
am
of
the
same
sentiment
bart
but
realistically
this
town
doesnt
want
to
pay
for
quality
player
and
hence
we
are
loosing
these
people
left
right
and
center
labour
is
also
responsible
for
their
boycott

i
would

joseph

says
it
was
nice
to
see
espn
show
game
between
the
wings
and
leafs
since
the
cubs
and
astros
got
rained
out
instead
of
showing
another
baseball
game
they
decided
on
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
a
classy
move
by
espn
it
was
a
classy
move
but
it
looks
like
espn
is
going
to
devote
most
of
the
coverage
to
the
pens
on
tuesday
night
they
continued
to
broadcast
the
pendevil
game
even
though
pittsburgh
had
the
game
well
in
control
granted
they
did
show
some
bonus
coverage
of
the
caps
and
isles
but
they
cut
away
from
the
close
game
which
went
into
double
ot
to
update
us
on
the
fifth
goal
of
the
rout
thursday
was
a
good
game
even
if
it
was
the
second
straight
game
between
the
pens
and
devils
imho
they
should
program
some
variety
into
the
telecastsyes
i
know
the
game
shown
on
saturday
is
between
the
bs
and
sabres
probably
throwing

and
what
about

blues

was
a
great
atmosphere
last
night
at
the
st
louis
arena
as
joseph
and
the
blues
shutout
the
hawks
for
the
second
consecutive
game
people
were
cheering
the
blues
long
before
faceoff
time
and
they
kept
going
for
the
entire
game
my
friends
and
i
went
out
celebrating
until
the
early
morning
hours
with
some
of
the
players
heres
a
game
summary
from
the
st
louis
postdisptach
enjoy
by
dave
luecking
of
the
postdispatch
staff
at
pm
friday
night
the
arena
crowd
of
paid
homage
to
blues
goalie
curtis
joseph
the
fans
began
bowing
their
arms
extended
taking
the
the
lead
from
a
fan
who
held
a
sign
that
read
only
god
saves
more
than
joseph
it
was
a
fitting
tribute
to
joseph
who
has
brought
the
blues
to
the
verge
of
a
surprising
sweep
joseph
recorded
his
second
successive
shutout
friday
blanking
the
blackhawks
in
game
of
the
norris
division
semifinals
and
giving
the
blues
a
lead
in
the
bestofseven
series
the
blackhawks
havent
scored
against
joseph
since
the
mark
of
the
second
period
of
game
joseph
has
shut
out
the
blackhawks
for
minutes
seconds
a
blues
record
jacques
plante
held
the
previous
record
of
set
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
against
the
philadelphia
flyers
one
of
only
two
series
the
blues
have
sweeped
in
their
history
the
blues
can
wrap
up
their
first
sweep
since
with
a
victory
in
game
a
nationally
televised
game
that
begins
at
noon
sunday
the
blues
have
had
only
two
sweeps
in
franchise
history
both
in
when
they
swept
philadelphia
and
los
angeles
en
route
to
the
stanley
cup
finals
the
shutout
friday
was
easier
than
on
wednesday
in
game
when
joseph
had
to
make
saves
this
time
the
blues
held
the
shots
down
to
and
the
blackhawks
couldnt
touch
joseph
well
they
touched
joseph
numerous
times
shoving
him
and
pushing
him
at
every
opportunity
to
try
to
get
him
off
his
game
but
joseph
and
the
blues
were
unfazed
dishing
out
their
own
punishment
along
the
way
the
blues
grinders
bob
bassen
rich
sutter
kevin
miller
and
dave
lowry
wore
down
the
blackhawks
taking
the
visitors
from
chicago
off
their
game
the
grinders
set
the
stage
for
the
glamour
boys
the
gifted
playmakers
and
scorers
who
made
the
most
of
their
opportunities
craig
janney
brett
hull
and
nelson
emerson
scored
getting
one
goal
in
each
period
hull
assisted
on
janneys
firstperiod
power
play
goal
after
two
unwise
chicago
penalties
checker
miller
set
up
hulls
goal
in
the
second
period
and
rookie
denny
felsner
assisted
for
emerson
who
scored
at
of
the
final
period
blues
fans
jumped
to
their
feet
in
celebration
of
that
goal
and
began
yelling
sweep
sweep
sweep
they
also
taunted
chicago
goalie
ed
belfour
bellfour
bellfour
they
also
chanted
na
nanana
heyhey
good
bye
such
talk
is
a
tad
premature
theres
still
one
game
left
but
the
blues
are
on
a
roll
they
have
the
blackhawks
on
their
heels
the
blues
set
the
tone
early
on
friday
with
two
crunching
hits
in
the
first
minute
of
play
rich
sutter
leveled
bryan
marchment
and
brendan
shanahan
dumped
steve
smith
at
center
ice
chicago
tried
to
retaliate
but
troy
murrays
decision
to
run
into
joseph
backfired
referee
dan
marouelli
gave
him
a
roughing
penalty
the
blues
didnt
get
a
shot
on
goal
on
the
power
play
and
they
survived
a
scare
after
chicago
killed
the
penalty
when
rick
zombo
gave
the
puck
away
to
steve
larmer
joseph
stopped
larmers
shot
and
everything
else
chicago
threw
at
him
in
the
first
period
the
hawks
ignored
the
scouting
report
on
joseph
about
shooting
high
and
continued
to
shoot
low
where
josephs
butterfly
style
is
deadly
rookie
bret
hedican
picked
up
three
consecutive
penalties
midway
through
the
period
two
for
hooking
and
one
for
holding
but
chicago
got
only
two
shots
on
goal
as
many
as
miller
the
blues
penalty
killer
twice
stole
the
puck
and
just
missed
on
good
scoring
chances
against
belfour
marouelli
began
calling
penalties
on
the
blackhawks
to
even
things
up
he
caught
brent
sutter
hooking
shanahan
four
seconds
after
hedicans
third
penalty
he
called
marchment
for
elbowing
janney
along
the
boards
at
and
gave
the
blues
a
twoman
advantage
later
when
christian
ruuttu
slashed
shanahan
the
blues
worked
around
the
puck
on
the
ensuing
power
play
and
hull
got
it
where
he
likes
it
in
the
high
slot
hulls
shot
hit
belfours
right
shoulder
and
the
puck
bounced
precariously
close
to
the
goal
line
belfour
dived
back
to
cover
but
the
puck
squirted
loose
to
janney
who
poked
it
into
the
net
at
for
his
first
goal

late
this

the
question
is
will
hockey
be
moved
to
permenantly
or
will
it
be
where
they
have
a
game
of
the

currently
working
with
cable
companies
to
ensure
a
good
startup
base
needed
for

for
any

new

service
the
problem
faces
is
the
tcicablevision
connection
in
the
merger
of
their
prime
and
sportschannel
networks
prime
sportschannel
will
try
to
wrestle
away
nhl
from
espn
in
the
offseason
alsotci
and
cablevision
have
control
a
large
number
of
cable
systems
around
the
country
with
a
total
of
million
subscribers
tcicablevision
will
do
their
best
that
never
gets

successfully
and
the
nhls
value
will
suddenly
skyrocket
in
this
cable
war
between
prime
sc

nhl
is
more
vital
to
the

the

showing

have
been
shutting

out
lately
by
holding
the

to
only

eric

the

kept
the
pressure
on

for
a
while
after
that
but
he
was
strong
and
kept
the

from
doing
further
damage
the
game
then
became
a
defensive
struggle
for
a
while
the
sabres
got
the
first
chance
on

killing
team

did
create

for

greg

at
to

they
couldnt

when

iced

shots
were
buffalo
after

one
point
mike
emrick
interviewed
flyers
president
jay
snider
between
periods
jay
was
disappointed
to
not
make
the
playoffs
but
not
discouraged
this
was
considered
a
rebuilding
year
after
the
trade
and
he
seemed
very
happy
with
the
way
the
season
went
when
asked
if
he
agonized
over
the
trade
he
said
that
it
was
russ
farwells
trade
and
not
his
that
it
only
was
an
issue
for
him
and
ed
snider
as
far
as
the
money
but
yes
there
was
some
agonizing
and
theyd
do
it
all
over
again
when
asked
how
the
coaching
situation
would
be
handled
for
next
year
he
said
that
its
russ
call
and
russ
will
evaluate
things
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
feels
that
theyre
years
away
from
a
shot
at
the
cup
he
expects
to
get
into
the
playoffs
next
year
have
a
shot
at
a
division
title
the
following
year
and
a
shot
at
the
finals
the
year
after
that
this
based
on
the
current
level
of
play
and
anticipated
improvements
over
the
summer
hes
very
happy
with
the
realignment
he
called
it
outstanding
happy
with
the
current
expansion
feels
that
the
talent
pool
is
big
enough
with
the
unflux
of
europeans
but
feels
that
they
must
make
sure
existing
franchises
are
stable
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
playing
in
the
olympics
booo
but
said
that
there
was
a
definite
split
among
owners
and
that
this
certainly
would
only
happen
in
four
years
if
there
was
a
consensus
the
sabres
gave
the
flyers
their
second
power
play
of
the
game
when
brad
may
took
a
tripping
penalty
at
of
the
second
the
flyers
had
a
little
trouble
getting
started
but
eventually
did
hawgood
took
a
pass
as
he
was
moving
throug
the
neutral
zone
and
handed
the
puck
to
eklund
just
outside
the
sabres
blue
line
along
the
right
boards
eklund
carried
into
the
zone
nad
passed
across
to
dineen
who
tried
a
one
timer
from
between
the
blue
line
and
the
top
of
the
left
circle
he
half
fanned
on
it
and
sent
the
puck
trickling
through
the
slot
fuhr
didnt
know
where
it
was
though
and
hawgood
won
the
race
to
it
and
flipped
it
into
essentially
an
open
net
at
then
mogilny
on
a
breakaway
he
slipped
through
two
flyers
at
the
blue
line
and
went
in
on
soderstrom
he
went
with
the
backhander
but
soderstrom
was
all
over
it
the
flyers
then
took
some
bad
discipline
type
penalties
that
really
hurt
them
viacheslav
butsayev
took
a
double
minor
for
roughing
and
high
sticking
when
barnaby
got
under
his
skin
and
drew
one
minor
then
according
to
gary
dornhoefer
took
a
dive
to
get
the
other
there
was
no
video
at
the
sabres
coudlnt
get
started
ryan
mcgill
poked
at
the
puck
just
after
a
sabre
carried
into
the
flyers
zone
and
after
a
bunch
of
people
poked
at
it
dineen
emerged
with
it
and
headed
the
other
way
it
started
out
a
on
but
brindamour
hustled
ahead
to
make
it
a
on
and
back
off
the
defenseman
dineen
let
it
rip
from
the
top
of
the
right
circle
to
make
it
flyers
at
that
was
all
for
fuhr
john
muckler
sent
in
dominik
hasek
to
take
over
but
the
sabres
still
had
lots
of
power
play
time
again
they
took
some
time
to
just
get
into
the
flyers
zone
and
when
they
finally
did
the
flyers
were
all
over
them
boos
began
to
ring
through
the
building
but
they
finally
got
through
soderstrom
on
an
ugly
goal
smehlik
took
a
shot
from
the
top
of
the
zone
that
missed
and
kicked
out
to
hawerchuk
in
the
slot
hawerchuk
tried
a
backhander
as
he
skated
towards
the
goal
line
to
the
right
as
galley
dove
down
to
block
it
mistake
he
should
have
let
soderstrom
handle
the
backhander
and
worried
about
a
the
rebound
or
b
barnaby
who
was
camped
behind
the
goal
line
right
next
to
the
net
well
the
rebound
dropped
right
next
to
soderstrom
and
mistake
galley
just
laid
there
and
watched
barnaby
get
three
hacks
at
the
puck
before
he
finally
pushed
it
through
the
goalie
he
didnt
even
swing
his
stick
out
to
try
and
knock
the
puck
away
with
the
goal
at
two
streaks
end
for
the
flyers
of
shutout
hockey
and
straight
penalty
kills
lindros
put
them
right
back
on
the
power
play
at
with
a
high
sticking
minor
i
think
it
was
barnaby
again
this
time
the
sabres
were
able
to
get
set
up
quickly
but
couldnt
get
too
much
quality
on
goal
the
sabres
continued
to
keep
the
puck
in
the
flyers
end
for
a
while
after
the
power
play
ended
things
evetually
settled
down
but
then
the
other
very
bad
penalty
mcgill
allowed
barnaby
to
get
under
his
skin
and
slashed
his
stick
just
before
a
faceoff
the
gloves
were
dropped
and
mcgill
started
pounding
the
crap
out
of
him
but
during
the
fight
he
gave
barnaby
a
head
butt
with
his
helmet
and
that
meant
a
match
penalty
for
slashing
fighting
and
for
the
major
minutes
of
power
play
time
for
the
sabres
at
barnaby
only
got
the
flyers
were
keeping
them
at
bay
for
a
while
but
there
was
only
so
long
they
could
do
that
after
a
couple
of
good
sabre
chances
audette
handed
to
ledyard
at
the
point
and
ledyard
sent
a
drive
that
was
knocked
down
by
soderstrom
lafontaine
whacked
at
the
bouncing
puck
from
the
left
side
of
the
net
and
knocked
it
over
to
randy
wood
at
the
right
soderstrom
had
moved
over
to
play
lafontaine
and
since
yushkevich
and
carkner
were
waving
at
the
puck
instead
of
picking
up
men
wood
just
slid
it
into
the
empty
net
at
to
close
the
flyers
lead
to
lafontaine
was
actually
trying
to
put
it
on
net
but
half
fanned
on
it
and
got
a
break
the
flyers
then
got
some
shorthanded
pressure
in
the
sabres
zone
but
hasek
was
strong
finally
it
was
keith
carney
passing
ahead
to
hawerchuk
into
the
neutral
zone
and
hawerchuk
sent
a
good
backhand
pass
to
mogilny
at
the
flyers
blue
line
another
minibreakaway
for
mogilny
he
elected
to
shoot
from
the
left
circle
and
he
threaded
the
needle
to
get
it
just
inside
the
far
post
at
for
his
of
the
season
ironically
the
youth
hockey
tip
between
the
and
second
period
was
tommy
soderstrom
talking
about
cutting
off
angles
that
was
all
in
the
shots
were
sabres
into
the
period
and
pelle
eklund
blew
a
golden
opportunity
to
get
the
flyers
the
lead
back
a
on
acton
with
the
puck
he
dropped
to
eklund
in
the
slot
and
eklund
held
the
puck
as
he
slid
through
the
left
circle
until
he
had
almost
no
angle
at
all
to
shoot
from
when
he
finally
did
shoot
he
hit
the
far
post
that
was
still
during
the
carryover
power
play
time
than
an
incredible
almost

skated
around

crowd
cheers
but
up
to
the

booth
for
some
strange
reason
and
in
the
meantime
emrick
and
dornhoefer
try
to
figure
out
what
they
could
be
reviewing
well
it
turns
out
that
it
was
the
taped
up
stick
blade
that
went
into
the
net
not
the
puck
emrick
mentions
that
one
of
the
criteria
for
scoring
a
goal
is
that
the
puck
must
go
into
the
net
dave
hannan
then
took
out
recchi
and
got
a
holding
minor
at
the
flyers
could
not
get
anything
going
at
all
they
finally
got
set
up
way
through
but
were
kept
on
the
perimeter
as
time
ran
out
beranek
stripped
the
puck
from
a
sabre
in
the
offensive
zone
along
the
right
boards
and
passed
it
across
to
eklund
at
the
top
of
the
left
circle
eklund
saw
dineen
heading
at
the
net
just
inside
the
right
circle
and
passed
through
to
him
dineen
fumbled
the
pass
but
twice
directed
it
at
hasek
and
eklund
swooped
in
and
chipped
the
bouncing
puck
over
the
goalie
for
his
at
flyers
but
the
sabres
came
right
back
lafontaine
picked
up
the
puck
in
his
offensive
left
corner
and
slid
it
to
bob
erry
behind
the
flyers
net
erry
started
to
skate
out
but
then
just
dropped
the
puck
back
to
nobody
behind
the
net
mogilny
flew
in
skated
around
and
stuffed
it
through
soderstroms
hole
for
his
at
to
tie
the
game
at
then
hawerchuk
took
a
retaliatory
roughing
penalty
at
the
flyers
set
up
in
the
sabres
zone
and
stayed
there
off
a
faceoff
high
in
the
sabres
zone
in
the
middle
while
brindamour
wrestled
for
the
puck
dineen
snuck
through
the
line
and
wristed
a
perfect
shot
low
to
haseks
glove
side
at
play
started
to
go
back
and
forth
until
hawgood
took
a
roughing
penalty
at
the
flyers
dumped
the
puck
into
the
sabres
zone
brindamour
and
ledyard
went
after
it
and
rod
got
the
puck
he
backed
away
from
the
right
boards
skated
to
the
right
faceoff
dot
and
passed
between
his
legs
to
dineen
crashing
through
the
slot
all
by
himself
dineen
waited
patiently
and
lifted
it
over
the
blocker
of
hasek
for
a
flyers
lead
at
hat
trick
of
the
season
for
dineen
of
his
career
shorthanded
goal
of
the
game
for
him
of
the
season
then
carney
took
a
tripping
penalty
at
to
kill
the
rest
of
the
sabres
power
play
not
much
action
on
the
on
and
the
sabres
got
most
of
the
chances
on
the
flyers
resulting
power
play
play
went
end
to
end
for
quite
a
while
after
that
and
both
goalies
had
to
make
some
big
saves
the
sabres
werent
able
to
pull
hasek
as
time
was
running
out
as
the
flyers
wouldnt
allow
any
consistant
possession
for
the
sabres
finally
as
time
was
running
out
ken
sutton
misplayed
the
puck
in
his
own
left
corner
and
brindamour
stripped
it
away
from
him
he
pulled
away
and
found
dineen
on
the
other
side
of
the
left
circle
and
dineen
found
acton
at
the
right
of
hasek
he

the

was

the

shots
were
buffalo

the

was

with

another

from

hadnt
been

kevin

with

same

had
a
blurb
about
bill
dineen
being
asked
about
whether

not
he
expected
to
be

next

his
response
was
that
he

to
come
back
he

he
did
a
good
job
this

but
that
he
would

for

grade
i
b
it
is
way
too
early
to
tell
about
ahola
who
was
acquired
probably
because
the
penguins
figured
that
they
would
lose
him
in
the
expansion
draft
ahola
had
only
played
games
this
season
i
think
its
actually
less
the
san
jose
mercury
news
may
be
in
err
here
of
them
with
the
sharks
in
the
games
he
has
played
he
appeared
quite
solid
defensively
although
he
hasnt
been
spectacular
and
his
offense
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
points
its
even
possible
that
the
trade
may
be
for
future
considerations
which
turn
out
to
be
peter
ahola
doug
wilson
season
acquired
trade
with
chicago
for
rw
kerry
toporowski
and
round
pick
in
entry
draft
grade
i
b
i
have
often
been
accused
of
overly
down
on
wilson
i
may
have
had
too
high
expectations
for
him
but
his
legs
knees
et
al
are
giving
out
nevertheless
when
he
was
playing
he
exhibited
a
strong
shooting
and
playmaking
abilities
even
if
he
has
lost
a
step
on
defense
which
unfortunately
he
demonstrated
this
year
as
well
as
at
times
he
was
slow
to
catch
the
opponent
forwards
and
his
offensive
output
was
only
good
enough
for
place
on
the
team
points
in
games
but
next
year
which
may
be
wilsons
last
if
he
can
stay
healthy
he
can
still
be
a
contributor
dean
kolstad
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
cd
its
probably
somewhat
unfair
for
me
to
judge
kolstad
on
just
a
handful
of
games
forgetting
exact
number
but
no
more
than
but
at
age
hes
quickly
running
out
of
time
if
he
wants
to
make
it
to
the
nhl
in
those
games
he
did
not
impress
anyone
after
generating
shots
in
the
first
period
of
the
first
game
he
played
he
scored
just
points
in
his
tenure
up
here
with
the
sharks
and
was
even
less
impressive
defensively
as
he
appeared
awkward
with
his
movement
and
was
prone
to
giveaways
he
needs
to
make
a
leap
in
his
level
of
performance
to
have
any
chance
of
making
the
team
pat
macleod
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
macleod
was
on
the
roster
a
lot
longer
than
kolstad
but
it
appears
to
my
memory
that
he
played
less
than
kolstad
because
the
sharks
were
reluctant
to
use
him
but
were
even
more
reluctant
to
send
him
to
the
minors
figuring
that
he
wouldnt
clear
waivers
in
fact
he
has
played
the
past
weeks
with
kansas
city
but
is
still
technically
there
on
a
rehabilitation
assignment
a
rehab
assignment
that
will
include
him
playing
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
since
he
has
played
so
little
i
cant
even
give
a
tentative
grade
on
him
but
he
demonstrated
last
year
excellent
offensive
skills
but
terrible
defensive
skills
tom
pederson
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
b
called
up
in
the
middle
of
the
season
when
the
defensive
corps
was
decimated
by
injuries
pederson
impressed
many
sharks
fan
here
on
net
including
yours
truly
he
demonstrated
very
good
offensive
skills
scoring
points
in
games
however
his
size
lbs
is
of
concern
and
soon
after
he
began
to
shine
offensive
did
teams
begin
to
push
him
around
physically
on
both
sides
of
the
ice
although
he
had
appeared
fearless
in
his
approach
but
to
be
successful
he
probably
needs
to
bulk
up
to
have
a
fighting
chance
on
surviving
against
some
of
the
bigger
players
in
the
league
claudio
scremin
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
dd
he
played
all
of
games
in
the
league
this
year
but
was
thoroughly
umimpressive
just
as
he
was
at
the
end
of
last
season
again
it
may
be
a
small
sample
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
kolstad
scremin
at
age
is
quickly
running
out
of
time
he
was
not
a
contributor
on
either
offense
or
defense
in
the
games
he
played
with
the
sharks
the
only
notable
thing
that
will
go
down
in
scremins
entry
of
league
stats
is
probably
the
fact
that
he
was

traded

i
heard
a
story
on
the
local
sports
news
broadcast
in
edmonton
oiler
owner
peter
pocklington
will
be
holding
a
press
conference
next
week
while
the
exact
details
are
not
known
it
is
believed
to
concern
the
oilers
future
rumour
has
it
that
pocklington
signed
a
tentative
lease
arrangement
with
copps
collesium
in
hamilton
during
the
press
conference
pocklington
may
announce
the
deal
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
deal
may
simply
be
a
way
to
force
edmonton
northlands
to
renegotiate
the
oiler
lease
on
the
stadium
northlands
has
offered
to
buy
the
oilers
for
million
earlier
but
the
offer
was
rejected
immediately
by
pocklington
as
for
me
my
opinion
is
divided
edmonton
has
been
fairly
supportive
of
the
oilers
even
though
theyre
a
small
market
team
they
had
many
sellouts
in
the
even
with
the
problems
that
the
team
had
this
year
they
still
brought
in
more
fans
than
many
teams
in
larger
cities
did
on
the
other
hand
if
the
team
does
move
there
is
no
place
more
deserving
than
hamilton
of
course
how
would
that
affect
the
grand
realignment
scheme
of
bettman
following
up
on
this
the
provincial
government
has
been
asked
by
the
opposition
to
block
any
deal
that
pocklington
is
offering
to
hamilton
the
government
said
that
pock
is
going
nowhere
why
dont
i
believe
the
government
wasnt
it
pocklington
who
wanted
to
be
tory
leader
years
ago

i
prefer
to
watch
hockey
than
seeing
shots
of
felix
potvin
slashing
and
spearing
dino
ciccerelli
standing
in
front
of
the
net
he
has
every
right
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
just
not
in
the
crease
yes
he
does
but
the
goalie
sure
as
hell
doesnt
want
him
there
when
i
played
roller
hockey
boy
do
i
miss
those
days
as
a
goalie
i
would
scream
at
my
defense
to
clear
guys
out
of
the
slot
i
dont
care
if
hes
in
the
crease
or
not
get
him
the
hell
away
from
me
so
i
can
see
the
ball
yes
roller
hockey
remember
and
if
there
was
nobody
around
to
clear
the
slot
then
id
do
it
myself
by
pushing
the
offending
playerhard
i
hate
people
in
my
way
when
im
the
goalie
and
i
am
sure
felix
does
too
i
should
say
that
i
didnt
see
the
incident
so
if
potvin
really
swung
the
stick
big
time
then
thats
not
right
but
he
can
move
people
out
of
the
way
hes

all
that
surrounds
it
blues
traveler
i
have
to
agree
wholeheartedly
with
this
view
i
dont
like
to
see
stickwork
but
you
have
to
clear
players
away
from
in
front
my
personal
favorite
move
im
a
goalie
too
is
to
give
the
offeding
player
a
good
whack
on
the
back
of
their
skates
when
the
ref
isnt
looking
makes
em
go
down
like
a
ton
of
bricks
but
doesnt
cause
injuries
unless
they
dont
know
how
to
fall
im
talking
about
hitting
the
blades
here
not
the
foot
it
also
makes
the
player
you
hit
and
anyone
who
sees
really
mad
and
apt
to
take
a
stupid
retaliation
penalty
unfortunately
it
also
leaves
your
blocker
out
of
position
for
a
short
timei
dont
do
this
if
a
shot
is
likely
on
the
short
side
hmmmaybe
i
should
mail
potvin
this
method
in
french
and
with
helpful
diagrams
of
course
it
sure
would
be
nice
to
see
ciccerelli
who
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
btw
hes
not
a
big
guy

i

the

anyone
got
the

paul

pick
no
perhaps
he
wont
last

i
dont

the
exact

in

in

it

covered

so
maybe
espn
will
grab
their

i
dont

ottawa

it
is
almost
that
alexander
daigle
will
go

either
stay

be

in
montreal

quebec
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the

championships
daigle
didnt

this
for
his

san

will
then
get
kariya
tampa

will
either
go
for

kozlov
i

thats
it

a

rob
niedemeyer
probably
spelt
the
last
name
wrong
the
sharks
appear
to
be
leaning
toward
picking

niedermayer
a

his
brother
scott
is
a
defenseman
picked
by
nj
a
couple
years
ago
they
brought
him
in
for
a
physicaltryout
a
week
or
so
ago
from
what
i
have
read
niedermayer
is
the
best
skater
in
the
draft
plays
both
offense
and
defense
and
isnt
afraid
of
physical
play
defensively
the
sharks
are
looking
pretty
good
in

of
defense
prospects
rathje
sykora
ragnarsson

the
thing
that
confuses
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decided
to
show
the
penguins
and
devils
again
on
thursday
night
being
that
both
of
the
first
two
games
were
dominated
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
different
game
this
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
games
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposure
espn
must
have
some
very
poor
marketing
people
they
are
only
concerned
with
featuring
players
ie
mario
than
featuring
good
competitive
hockey
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
as
far
as
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
going
to
show
campbell
conference
games
regularly
in
the
first
two
rounds
i
believe
that
they
are
only
going
to
show
campbell
games
in
the
first
two
rounds
as
those
series
wear
on
games
or
perhaps
games
ive
heard
that
this
is
because
most
of
their
market
is
east
coast
and
hence
would
prefer
the
wales
stuff
also
dont
expect
canadian
teams
on
espn
in
summary
if
you
want
to
see
a
network
that
provides
good
hockey
coverage
watch
cbc
from
canada
they
may
be
biased
toward
canadian
teams
but
they
dont
treat
the
viewers
like
idiots
they
provide

where
domi
hit
a
vancouver
player
and
was
given
a
min
penalty
ron
said
that
it
was
called
a
penalty
because
his
stick
was
involved
but
don
stuck
with
the
opinion
that
it
was
a
good
hit
with
domi
hitting
the
vancouver
player
with
his
shoulder
don
its
sad
what
theyre
doing
for
hockey
a
minute
penalty
for
a
nosebleed
next
they
went
to
the
playoff
series
between
detroit
and
toronto
people
in
detroit
were
calling
wendel
clarke
wendy
for
not
fighting
however
don
pointed
out
that
probert
was
not
fighting
either
this
lead
don
into
a
tirad
about
fighting
and
stickwork
and
how
banning
fighting
leads
to
more
high
sticking
its
like
college
hockey
the
little
wee
guy
with
the
visor
is
brave
as
anybody
thats
why
youre
seeing
so
much
stickwork
because
they
know
you
wont
drop
your
gloves
and
give
them
a
shot
the
rules
are
made
by
people
who
dont
know
whats
going
on
in
hockey
the
final
topic
don
discussed
was
dale
hunter
don
pointed
out
that
he
was
leading
the
league
in
goals
and
showed
a
clip
of
hunter
from
a
previous
game
when
he
was
younger
hunter
was
taught
to
play
to
win
which
differs
from
todays
idea
of
just
letting
kids
have
fun
at
then
end
of
the
episode
they
showed
a
clip
from
a
coachs
corner
with
the
tape
on
fast
forward
so
that
don
sounded
like
one
of
the
chipmunks
rating
typical
antifighting
posturing
not
too
much
humour
but
some
good

episode
summary
once
again
the
episode
started
with
a
shot
of
dons
tie
this
was
a
different
tie
than
last
time
don
pointed
out
some
of
the
characters
on
the
tie
but
gave
them
different
names
felix
the
cat
sylverster
maclean
daffy
duck
etc
ron
maclean
asked
don
what
he
thought
of
the
current
wingsleafs
game
don
thought
it
was
good
burns
told
the
leaf
players
they
won
in
their
building
were
going
to
win
in
ours
don
then
began
to
praise
gilmour
again
don
pointed
out
that
gilmour
has
never
got
less
than
points
or
a
goal
in
any
game
since
he
got
points
in
a
game
against
st
louis
don
also
claims
that
he
gave
a
lot
of
encouragement
to
gilmour
which
was
partly
responsible
for
his
good
play
several
clips
were
then
shown
of
gilmour
from
the
series
a
hit
on
constantinov
and
a
pass
to
andrewchuk
resulting
in
a
goal
on
the
game
itself
the
wings
were
taking
a
lot
of
penalties
in
the
first
period
the
wings
have
enough
talent
to
score
short
handed
however
and
when
the
leafs
get
a
power
play
coach
burns
tells
the
leaf
players
dont
let
them
score
on
you
ron
brought
up
the
previous
quebecmontreal
game
note
montreal
won
that
game
in
overtime
despite
having
a
possible
game
winner
disqualified
because
it
was
batted
in
with
a
high
stick
don
thought
the
high
stick
was
obvious
even
without
the
use
of
instant
replay
on
the
buffaloboston
series
note
buffalo
is
currently
winning
the
series
don

playoff
checks
for
his
play
wendel
clarke
has
recently
been
criticized
for
his
performance
during
the
detroittoronto
series
don
defended
him
by
saying
that
he
cant
play
the
way
he
should
because
of
the
leagues
new
rules
this
used
to
be
a
rough
and
tough
league
now
its
all
hack
and
slash
don
lays
the
blame
on
gil
stien
for
the
problems
dons
opinions
on
fighting
and
stickwork
are
shared
by
wings
gm
and
coach
bryan
murray
a
clip
from
a
news
conference
by
murray
was
shown
in
which
murray
made
statements
claiming
the
elimination
of
fighting
increases
stickwork
don
also
read
a
newspaper
article
in
which
murray
makes
the
following
statements
players
dont
fight
because
theyre
afraid
of
getting
thrown
out
of
the
game
as
instigator
instead
they
settle
grudges
by
getting
their
sticks
and
slicing
each
other
is
this
what
the
fans
want
to
see
i
guarantee
there
wouldnt
be
as
many
slashes
if
fighting
were
kept
in
the
game
don
warned
league
commisioner
gary
bettman
to
smarten
up
with
fighting
in
hockey
he
went
on
to
say
that
before
there
used
to
be
one
guy
cut
with
a
high
stick
in
a
series
now
with
no
fights
someone
gets
cut
every
period

the
thing
that
confuses
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decided
to
show
the
penguins
and
devils
again
on
thursday
night
being
that
both
of
the
first
two
games
were
dominated
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
different
game
this
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
games
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposure
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
as
far
as
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
going
to
show
campbell
conference
games
regularly
in
the
first
two
rounds
i
believe
that
they
are
only
going
to
show
campbell
games
in
the
first
two
rounds
as
those
series
wear
on
games
or
perhaps
games
also
does
anyone
have
info
on
abc
coverage
for
this
sunday
espn
had
an
advertise
for

i
dont
know
what
the
hell
they
are
trying
to
do
especially
against
nfl
draft
well
i
guess
there
goes
the

i
think
the
threeheaded
gms
guiding
principle
was
to
keep
veterans
in
favor
of
youngsters
only
if
they
offered
a
significant
advantage
doesnt
sound
like
a
bad
strategy
to
me
no
and
in
fact
that
was
ferreiras
original
strategy
which
the
troika
proceeded
to
simply
continue
to
implement
there
wasnt
exactly
a
radical
shift
in
policy
when
he
was
ousted
something
people
seem
to
forget
the
only
real
question
is
whether
they
did
it
as
well
as
ferreira
could
have
if
he
stayed
or
whether
the
basic
strategy
was
flawed
since
ferreira
has
been
quoated
as
saying
hes
going
to
do
something
different
in
anaheim
with
the
ducks
my
guess
is
that
it
wasnt
as
good
in
practice
as
it
was
on
paper
and
hes
tweaking
it
a
bit
second
time
around
one
also
has
to
wonder
whether
the
strategy
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
we
hadnt
had
those
injuries
and
whether
were
complaining
about
the
weather
because
an
earthquake
collapsed
the
root
cellar
of
course
ferreira
had
also
traded
a
number
of
veterans
with
marginal
contributions
before
he
was
fired
so
its
not
clear
that
this
would
have
been
different
besides
they
were
marginal
contributors
lets
also
not
forget
that
ferreira
came
this
close
to
trading
kelly
kisio
which
if
the
rumors
ive
heard
are
true
was
over
the
strong
objections
of
other
aspects
of
shark
management
and
probably
had
a
lot
to
do
with
both
his
ouster
and
the
threeheaded
consensus
oriented
gm
imagine
for
a
second
where
the
sharks
would
be
today
if
that
fax
machine
hadnt
jammed
with
or
without
mullen
they
werent
going
to
be
a
playoff
team
what
good
does
it
do
them
to
hang
onto
a
player
whod
rather
be
elsewhere
especially
an
unhappy
player
that
isnt
playing
as
well
because
of
it
not
that
id
accuse
mullen
of
tanking
but
his
motivation
simply
wasnt
there
and
that
kind
of
thing
can
affect
the
team
an
example
from
this
season
skriko
was
brought
in
on
a
trial
basis
but
not
kept
because
of
his
age
i
thought
he
was
a
decent
contributor
worth
keeping
around
the
youth
movement
has
its
advantages
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veterans
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balance
right
balance
for
what
thats
the
issue
exactly
at
the
time
they
let
skriko
go
we
hadnt
yet
had
the
major
injury
bugs
that
killed
us
later
id
much
rather
have
skriko
around
than
someone
like
dean
kolstad
but
at
that
point
that
wasnt
the
choice
and
since
the
choice
was
more
one
of
skriko
vs
someone
like
john
carter
i
think
the
right
choice
was
made
for
that
time
period

debate
is
that

plays

nothing
wrong
with

i
never

the

you
obviously
dont
watch
much
hockey
if
you
think
that
graves
is
a
goon
he
is
one
of
the
hardest
working
rangers
check
that
the
hardest
working
ranger
he
had
goals
this
year
not
bad
for
a
checking
type
of
player
and
showed
up
for
every
single
game
this
season
unlike
that
stiff
messier
he
is
fearless
and
throws
clean
checks
he
will
also
stand
up
to
someone
after
he
hits
them
not
like
that
pussy
oaf
exactly
my
point
if
youd
watch
games
more
closely
youd
see
a
lot
of
goons
going
after
him
ulf
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
less
physical
players
for
pgh
are
left
alone
ulf
plays
rough
hockey
but
only
when
other
players
are
putting
the
rush
on
mario
or
jagr
if
you
want
to
say
anyone
on
the
penguins
is
a
cheap
shot
or
a
goon
say
its
jennings
or
caufield
dontslander
a
good
defenseman
because
your
favorite
players
cant
beat
the
pens
even
when
they
take
dives
like
gartner
to
try
for
the
cheap
penalties
as
for
his
slash
of
lemieux
fine

we

when

i

do

im
new

ill
be
happy
if
they
win
it
before
i

piled

may
be

but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlike
islander
fans
who
only
show
up
when
the

wins
this
has
been
observed
many
times
its
true
definitely
i
have
a
feeling
that
alot
of
people
out
there
may
not
like
this
statement
but
by
far
the
worst
band
wagon

are
the
pit

at

at
the
present
case

i
know

who
just

him
how
bout

beating

doesnt

they

detroit
in

start
him
when
do
the

start
me
uhhhh
they
started
a
week
ago
im
not
saying
that
this
is
true
of
all
the
waddlers
fans
but
there
seems
to
be
alot
of
them
floating
around
who
really
know
nothing
about
hockey
except
that
theyre
newly
beloved
waddlers
are
the
best
team
in
the
game
right
now
and
when
theyre
not
the

great
i

ended

went

coming

of
the

team
when
he
was
traded
away
in
he
rarely
lost
a

was
one
of
the
toughest
players
in
the
whl
wood
is
fairly
small
for
an

i

fleury

isnt

dody
is
no
fleury
having
been

three

four
of
his
fights
closeup
he
simply
isnt
ready
to
fight
at
an
nhl
level
assuming
that
its
his
role
which
is
all
he
really
showed
us
in
his
few
games
up
from
kc
if
he
can
pass
shoot

skate
i
never
saw
much
of
it
all
he
has
is
a
right
fist
which
isnt
bad
but
at
the
nhl
level
the
other
players
are
smart
enough
to
grab
the
thing
before
he
can
land
anything
significant
once
you
control
that
hand
hes
a
fish
flopping
on
the
beach
and
the
other
player
can
do
just
about
anything
he
wants
to
him
his
entire
strategy
seemed
to
be
keep
the
hand
out
of
reach
until
he
found
an
opening
and
i
never
once
saw
him
find
an
opening
worth
talking
about
he
got
neutralized
quickly

wayne
made
his
own
bedchoosing
mcnall
over
sather
and
hockey
destinyhe
should
sleep
in
it
instead
of
whining
ego
got
absolute
nonsense
the
decision
that
was
made
was
pocklingtons
he
chose
mill
over
gretzky
if
gretzky
wasnt
upset
about
not
being
able
to
win
a
cup
in
la
then
i
submit
that
he
wasnt
worth
the
mill
the
best
of
himhe
thought
the
supporting
cast
in
edmonton
didnt
matterthat
he
was
the
show
himself
how
do
you
know
what
he
thinks
or
thought
the
only
thought
that
i
can
see
that
you
have
revealed
is
your
own
you
dont
like
gretzky
big
deal
now
my
only
complaint
about
lemieux
is
that
he
dives
too
much
but
last
year
patrick
convinced
him
twice
to
accept
bowman
and
hockey
destiny
rather
than
his
ego
the
real
purpose
of
diving
is
not
merely
an
attempt
to
draw
a
penalty
what
the
player
is
trying
to
do
is
make
the
checkers
keep
their
distance
so
the
ref
wont
be
fooled
i
cant
imagine
why
anyone
would
expect
someone
like
lemieux
to
change
his
game
why
dont
you

are
pretty

about
the

any

about
the
recent
pens
massacre
of
the

actually
i
am
bit
puzzled
too
and
a
bit
relieved
however
i
am
going
to
put
an
end
to
nonpittsburghers
relief
with
a
bit
of
praise
for
the
pens
man
they
are
killing
those
devils
worse

i
thought
jagr
just
showed
you
why
he
is
much
better
than
his

he
is

bowman
should
let
jagr
have
a

in

since
the

are

by
the
way
i
am
canadian
play
a
little
and
watched
hockey
night
in
canada
never
missed
a
show
well
thats
really
great
pat
i
guess
since
youve
played
a
little
you
thereby
qualify
as
an
expert
especially
since
you
watch
all
the
games
on
tv
all
that
qualifies
you
as
is
a
armchair
quarterback
or
a
coach
potato
not
that
i
condone
violence
but
ill
make
an
exception
for
mario
pat
walker
again
just
further
evidence
as
to
what
kind
of
an
expert
you
are
truly
a
stupid
statement
mario
is
definately
one
of
the
best
players
to
play
the
game
im
not
saying
he
is
the
best
to
ever
play
the
game
but
he
should
come
to
mind
when
that
question
is
asked
lets
face
it
he
just
returns
from
radiation
therapy
with
around
a
dozen
games
left
overtakes
lafontaine
for
the
scoring
lead
and
then
buries
him
no
i
guess
he
just
got
lucky
speaking
of
lafontaine
now
theres
a
guy
who
should
be
considered
for
the
hart
trophy
as
well
certainly
one
of
the
better

i
can
here

im
hoping
i
can
get
a
reading
from
some
of
you
about
the
move
of
the
north
stars
to
dallas
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
as
much
as
id
like
to
see
the
nhl
only
a
hour
drive
from
me
i
cant
help
but
feel
for
the
people
in
minnesota
unless
they
truly
didnt
support
the

the

now
have
a
small
chance
of
reaching
the
quarterfinals
if
austria
beats

tonight
the
swiss
took
the
lead
after
hakan
ahlund
made
an
incredibly
stupid
drop
pass
at
his
own
blue
line
and
celio
came
in
alone
with
soderstrom
and
beat

to

the

howald

slammed
on

and
his

went

one
of
the
lousiest
periods
ive
seen
sweden
play
this
year
second

saw
a
new
swedish
team
and
the
swiss
had
to
ice
the

many
times
on
a

nylander

pavoni
made

but
peter

then
a

goal
from

a

from

hit
two
players
on

also
jonas

jan

third

sweden
equalized
on
a

shot
from

that
trickled
through

then
another
defensive
mistake
by
the
swedes
waeger
was
allowed
to
skate
around
the

unattacked

from

russia
won
the
shots
in

first

and
they
had
the
most

opportunities
but
they

saw

of

kariya
entered

valeri
karpov
i
agree
the
difference
in
this
game
was
lindros
and
kariya
and
in
part
also
tugnutt
kariya
had
a
far
better
game
now
than
vs
the
swedes
and
he
was
very
impressive
kariya
got
the
place
in
the
line
with
lindros
after
mike
gartner
went
out
with
a
ribinjury
early
in
the

lindros
btw
lead
the
point
scoring
with
pts
before
this

pts
ahead

double

the

just
put
on
an

of
hustle
team
play
and
consistent
pounding
and
took
it
back
to
calgary
with
the

tied

games
each
the
final
score
was
with
the
third
goal
an
emptynetter
at
of
the
third
conacher
this
is
not
an
official
game
report
just
my
observations
from
the
stands
melrose
made
a
wise
decision
and
put
stauber
back
in
goal
robb
had
something
to
prove
and
he
did
in
stopping
of
while
facing
a
fierce
calgary
attack
there
were
numerous
highlight
film
saves
kings
third
and
fourth
lines
rose
to
the
occasion
playing
rough
while
avoiding
bad
penalties
warren
rychel
scored
the
gamewinner
early
in
the
second
period
rookie
defenseman
alexi
zhitnik
scored
the
first
from
the
blue
line
late
in
the
first
dave
taylor
is
awesome
he
suffered
a
broken
nose
partway
through
the
second
pariod
checked
from
behind
into
the
boards
by
roberts
who
got
and
a
game
he
came
back
late
in
the
third
and
was
on
the
ice
when
conacher
scored
the
empty
netter
actually
it
was
in
the
third
period
his
return
did
bring
a
spark
to
the
crowd
and
to
the
players
who
played
awesome
defense
in
the
third
the
kings
goto
guys
still
are
not
producing
no
goals
from
kurri
granato
sandstrom
or
robitaille
who
have
a
total
of
points
between
them
you
forgot
about
gretzky
if
any
of
these
guys
start
scoring
the
kings
will
be
unstoppable
if
they
continue
the
great
defensive
work
as
well
mccreary
sucks
he
called
mcsorely
for
high
sticking
someone
who
was
already
on
the
ice
and
sandstrom
for
high
sticking
when
he
himself
was
already
on
the
ice
he
missed
many
flagrant
stick
penalties
including
one
from
flame
goalie
jeff
reese
who
followed
granato
out
to
almost
the
blue
line
where
he
crosschecked
him
he
called
the
game
very
inconsistently
with
a
series
of
tickytack
penalties
in
the
first
and
almost
none
in
the
third
cant
the
nhl
supply
decent
officiating
i
was
sitting
directly
across
the
ice
from
ron
and
nancy
reagan
when
the
empty
netter
was
scored
nancy
leapt
out
of
her
seat
with
both
fists
high
in
the
air
way
to
go
nancy
this
series
is
still
too
close
to
call
tuesdays
game
may
be
the
deciding
one
i
expect
king
might
put
vernon
back
in
even
though
reese
had
two
good
games
in
la
reese
has
historically
been
good
in
la
this
was
only
the
second
time
he
lost
there
this
move
would
be
good
for
the
kings
since
vernon
is
such
a
sieve
i
am
sure
that
stauber
will
get
the
call
for
the
kings
stauber
will
be
in
net
on
tuesday
hopefully
he
will
provide
another
stellar
performance
and
earn
the
name
robb
stopper
stauber
the
firswt
two
lines
of
the
kings
have
to
wake
up
while
it
is
great
to
see
you
cannot
depend
on
pat
conacher
and
warren
rychel
for
all
of
your
offense
i
expect
sandstrom
granato
and
gretzky
might
be
put
back
together
on
a
line
like
they
were
early
in
the
season
this
would
leave
kurri
carson
and
luc
as
the
second
on
paper
these
two
lines
look
powerful
lets
see
if
they
can
make
it
real
i
believe
this
is
how
they
arei
know
it
is
gretzky
and
sandstrom
but
he
has
been
putting
a
number
of
people
on
left
also
the
carson
robataille
kurri
line
once
ignited
will
light
the
fire
of
the
other
lines
hopefully
go
kings
dvb
it
is
evident
that
the
scoring
drought
is
getting
to
luc
after
his
slight
breakaway
in
the
third
i
think
he
was
steamed
on
the
bench
this
emotion
might
help
him
break
his
streak
also
i
have
noticed
blake
has
had
a
few
really
good
chances
to
score
but
has
fanned
or
shot
wide
is
the
injury
still
affecting
him

the

though
having
pretty
much
the

is
an
entirely
different

was
addressed
to
all
when
she
puts
the

in
the

i
doubt
it
will
say
to
all
i
figure
she
wanted
to
let
people
here
see
what
was
in
it
since
it
is
a
topic
that
interests
a
lot
of
folks
here
thats
an
entirely
different
purpose
than
sending
the
letter
to
bettman
unfortunately
and
i
guess
i
let
you
know
didnt
i
you
do
not
represent
a
large
body
of
hockey
fans
by
any
standard
you
care
to
use
to
define
large
people
constitutes
nothing
more
than
a
tiny
group
of
fanatics
and
is
in
no
way
representative
of
a
large
body
of
hockey
fans
on
the
internet
let
alone
of
one
of
the
largest
computer
networks
in
the
world
the
largest
computer
networks
in
the
world
phrase
is
a
definition
of
the
internet
not
a
group
as
a
whole
that
she
claims
to
represent
as
for
the
business
of
whether
or
not
it
is
large
it
is
large
compared
to
say
the
number
of
folks
on
rsh
who
are
sending
a
letter
to
thank
him
for
changing
the
names
at
least
to
this
point
and
just
for
my
own
curiosity
i
thought
id
look
up
the
official
definition
of
large
in
the
dictionary
it
reads
large
having
more
than
usual
power
capacity
or
scope
exceeding
most
other
things
of
like
kind
in
quantity
or
size
now
i
have
no
idea
how
many
letters
bettman
may
have
gotten
on
the
issue
or
how
many
people
may
have
signed
them
people
may
be
up
there
thereby
validating
definition
i
would
also
wager
that
the
geographical
range
of
signatures
is
quite
large
which
would
give
it
a
large
scope
he
might
be
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
list
of
names
why
would
he
be
impressed
with
this
unless
it
were
large
i
am
of
course
assuming
that
you
actually
agree
with
what
you
are
writing
and
are
not
simply
trying
to
be
a
pain
about
the
whole
issue
to
hear
yourself
speak
i
personally
dont
know
whether
or
not
i
agree
with
the
letter
i
have
very
mixed
emotions
about
it
i
like
the
names
as
they
are
and
dont
think
they
make
it
that
difficult
to
learn
the
game
but
there
might
be
a

validity

of

will
require

a

and
set
the

back
as
far
as

goes
remember
the

were
unwilling

give
up
players
in

to
the
million
they
offered
for
joe
murphy
and
i
think
thats
a
good
approach
they
tried
to
sign
sergei
makarov
before
this
season
because
makarov
wouldnt
have
required
compensation
matching
the
makarov
offer
was
the
only
real
mistake
dave
king
has
made
this
year
i
have
to
wonder
about
the
intelligence
of
signing
a
old
who
is
obviously
on
the
downside
of
his
career
to
a
million
contract
risebrough
matched
the
offer
on
kings
request
and
makarov
has
spent
the
last
quarter
of
the
season
in
the
press
box

his
work
ethic
just
plain
stinks
not

mention
that
hes
lost
a
step
and
can
no
longer
get
himself
into
position
to
make
the
nifty
passes
i
think
makarov
will
be
available
for
free
this
offseason
to
anybody
who
agrees
to
pay
his
contract
hes
ineffective
in
calgary
but
he
might
be
able
to
help
a
team
like
san
jose
with
their
shortage
of
talent
if
theres
no
takers
and
makarov
doesnt
show
improvement
in
training
camp
i
think
the
flames
will
just
bite
the
bullet
and
buy
out
makarovs
contract
and
release
him
with
his
current
attitude
he
is

im
familiar
with

an

and
was
equally
pissed
that
was
a
local
television
station
contract
which
could
not
be
broken
for
that
item
i
strongly
suggest
you
call
that
affiliate
and
vent
your
anger
on
them
supposedly
one
station
had
told
my
friend
that
they
have
received
hundreds
of
angry
calls
which
will
translate
into
far
less
incentive
to
preempt
hockey
telecasts
in
future
the
contract
was
written
when
the
pathetic
wlaf
was
in
that

they
had

scheduled

that
was

leaked

to

never

released

the
thing
that
confuses
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decided
to
show
the
penguins
and
devils
again
on
thursday
night
being
that
both
of
the
first
two
games
were
dominated
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
different
game
this
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
games
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposure
nesn
owns
the
rights
to
bruin
telecasts
i
suspect
that
nesn
was
only
going
to
sell
one
telecast
to
espn
remember
espn
only
owns
exclusive
rights
to
the
finals
not
the
entire
playoffs
since
espn
bought
the
sca
contract
there
are
less
wrangles
to
untie
with
showing
the
devils
and
penguins
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
as
far
as
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
going
to
show
campbell
conference
games
regularly
in
the
first
two
rounds
i
believe
that
they
are
only
going
to
show
campbell
games
in
the
first
two
rounds
as
those
series
wear
on
games
or
perhaps
games
i
think
the
same
broadcast
rights
factor
comes
into
it
plus
they
have
no
way
of
fitting
western
game
times
into
their
current
schedule
unless
the
nhl
was
willing
to
make
a
western
club
move
up
their
game
i
think
the
nhl
got
as
much
as
it
could
when
it
shuffled
the
deck
for
abc
also
does
anyone

for

is

were

theyd
bounce

around
like
the

not

i
condone
violence
but
ill
make
an
exception
for
mario
but
if
mario
is
going

complain

being
hit
someone
should
give
him

scotty
something
real

complain
about
sorry

hate

you
along

lemieux

lemieux

the
one
with
geo
washington
abe
lincoln
and
many
other
great
men
and
women
of
this

whereas
you
come
from
the
one
with
david
koresh
yeah
mario
is
good
at
drawing
penalties
but
wouldnt
you
try
do
something
you
do
claim
to
play
to
give
your
team
an
advantage
i
dont
remember
lemieux
getting
any
diving
penalties
this
year
whereas
many
others
did
finally
mario
has
never
complained
about
being
hit
he
knows
its
part
of
the
game
he
gets
back
by
dishing
out
an
even
bigger
hit
to
the
same
guy
or
just
scoring
a
few
goals
or
setting

up

it

the

won

thirty

may

will
still

three

is

winning

cup
was
better
than
the
first

to
me
nothing
will
ever
top
that

one

this

richards

either
stay

i

up

who
are
now
saying
that
ottawas
gone
soft
on
daigle
and
is
thinking
hard
about
pronger
daigle
has
shown
an
attitude
the
latter
part
of
this
season
many
folks
havnet
liked
and
after
coming
back
from
his
second
multigame
suspension
for
being
stupid
hes
really
tanked
in
his
performance
his
stock
is
dropping
like
a
rock
also
remember
that
a
lot
of
teh
draft
stuff
comes
from
the
assumption
hell
be
traded
to
quebec
for
lots
of
prospects
its
not
clear
that
quebec
would
really
be
willing
to
pay
a
lot
for
him
given
his
current
status
hes
still
first
round
but
i
dont
consider
him
a
first
pick
lock
by
any
means
at
this
point
its
also
possible
that
the
senators
are
posturing
to
try
to
bring
down
his
signing
price
since
daigle
has
been
taking
some
lindros
lessons
during
thos
suspensions
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championships
daigle
didnt
show
this
for
his
junior
team
san
jose
will
then
get
kariya
no
kariya
wont
go
in
the
first
three
for
a
very
simple
reason
hes
not
leaving
college
and
i
dont
believe
any
of
the
expansion
teams
are
going
to
use
a
first
for
someone
who
wont
be
around
for
another
year
or
two
not
when
there
is
equally
good
or
almost
as
good
stuff
available
that
can
make
an
immediate
impact
san
jose
seems
to
be
leaning
heavily
towards
niedermayer
for
that
reason
kariya
could
go
or
unless
a
team
can
convince
him
to
leave
school
early
which
i
doubt
my
cut
on
things

they
stand
today

ottawa
daigle
if
not

san

niedermayer
unless
ottawa
skips
daigle

sad
i

the

was

in

i

they
even
missed

completely

they
were

two
guys
holding
each

concept

problems
with
hockey
is
that
it

very

show
everything
that
is
going

more
happens
away
from
the
puck
than
in
any
other
sport
except
maybe
football
and
they
can
do
isos
on
football
players
to
be

between

the
problem

is
that
sometimes

what

needs
is

im
new

and
a
big
hockey
fan
and
a
long
ranger
fan
but
remember
suffering
builds
character
i
have
some
final
questions
about
the
way
the
team
was
handled
in
that
last
dreadful
stretch
knowing
they
needed
offensive
help
from
the
blueline
why
didnt
we
see
mike
hurlbut
who
played
pretty
well
when
he
was
called
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
why
is
joe
kocur
playing
every
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
how
come
paul
broten
is
relegated
to
street
clothes
for
the
end
of
the
season
at
least
he
plays
with
some
heart
and
character
draws
penalties
and
plays
when
hes
on
the
ice
was
he
in
the
doghouse
for
some
reason
joe
cirella
enough
said
ranger
fans
may
be
suffering
but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlike
islander
fans
who
only
show
up
when
the
team
wins
as
far
as
the
stanley
cup
goes
i
think
theres
only
one
team
that
can
test
pittsburgh
and
thats
detroit
this
would
be
the
most
entertaining
and
hard
fought
series
mario
is
amazing
kurt
i
think
joe
kocus
should
play
every
night
he
is
a
big
physical
guy
and
he
gets
the
fans
into
the
game
with
some
big
hits
both
checks
and
fists
its
a
big
advantage
to
get
the
crowd
going
plus
he
helps
protect
the
other
players
notice
there
are
very
few
fights
when
kocur
is
on
the
ice
unless
he
is
it
i
have
seen
people
start
to
go
after
essa
tikkanen
only
to
go
slinking
away
when
kocur
steps
in
i
think
he
is
big
asset
but
should
be
third
line
and
special
situation
only
play
this
is
fast
becoming
a
game
without
the
goons
i
admit
kocur
may
get
the
fans
into
the
game
but
surely
they
would
rather
see
broten
taking
a
pass
from
kovalev
and
scoring
a
breakaway
goal
to
put
the
rangers
up
magic
goals
in
the
third
period
rather
than
seeing
kocur
take
another
stupid
penalty
and
the
rangers
giving
up
another
powerplay
goal
the
rangers
need
another
top
flight
center
who
can
take
the
pressure
off
messier
and
the
first
line
nemchinov
is
a
perfect
third
line
center

who
goes

your

pocklington

chosen
this

to

is

maximum
power
to
convince
northlands
to
give
him
a
better
arena
deal
or
a
better

and
it
is
before
the

with

might
involve

the
alberta
election
is
slated
fou
june
unless
something
really
goes
wrong
this
time
pocklington
could
end
up
being
the
embarassment
of
klein
if
he
goes
ahead
with
his
ultimatum
pocklington
is
many

is
not
one
of

gerald
people
still
have
an
axe
to
grind
with
this
guy
i
cannot
see
him
staying
for
long
he
can
dictate
termsbecause
other
cities
will
pay
his
price
if
edmonton
doesnt
but
the
people
in
edmonton
wont
budge
trust
me
on
this
one
edmonton
has
already
up
its
international
airport
and
surrendered
supremacy
to
calgary
and
over
the
next
few
years
edmonton
is
going
to
take
a
hard
hit
from
government
cutbacks
it
will
screw
itself
beyond
recogniton
if
it
manages
to
find
a
way
to
lose
its
hockey
team
toobecause
northlands
wants
to
continue
to
use
the
oilers
to
subsidize
horse
racing
northlands
wont
budge
ccording
to
one
of
the
board
members
bruce
campbell
however
in
this
case
about
the
longterm
financial
viability
of
the
oilers
the
fact
is
that
pocklington
is
basically
right
regardless
of
who
owns
the
team
and
it
is
right
to
provoke
the
crisis
now
before
the
team
accumulates
millions
of
dollars
in
losses
or
becomes
habitually
uncompetitive
because
of
lack
of
money
i
havent
heard
anything
but
attendance

was

hinthint
remeber

was
on

here
in

aces
of
town
pori
lost
vasili
the
son
of
victor
tichonov
the
famous
soviet
coach
said
that
for
a
long
time
the
sharks
have
been
persuading
him
to
take
the
assistant
coach
post
but
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
where
ever
he
goes
he
definitely
wont
be
coaching
assat
anymore
after
three
seasons
i
dont
know
why
vasili
is
a
good
coach
i
believe
assat
was
a
good
team
produced
many
players
to
our
national
team
assat
wasnt
a
skilled
team
imho
but
they
had
the
fighting
spirit
after
all
they
butchered
jokerit
in
the
playoffs
and
gave
hard
time
to
tps
the
champs
but
assat
wasnt
consistent
only
when
they
were
in
the
right
mood
they
could
beat
any
team
in
the
smliiga
i
am
not
sure
about
the
deal
with
the
sharks
as
i
said
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
but
he
and
the
sharks
are
going
to
negotiate
and
decide
during
the
wc
i
doubt
that
he
will
be
the
head
coach
but
maybe
theyll
do
some
compromise
could
somebody
post
more
information
about
vasili

many
people
have
suggested
that
fuhrs
play
is
the
only
reason
that
the
sabres
beat
the
bruins
while
fuhr
was
a
critical
factor
i
would
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
sabres
finally
got
some
scoring
from
people
other
than
mogilny
and
lafontaine
khmylev
sweeney
hawerchuck
etc
indeed
lafontaine
played
hurt
and
didnt
score
many
goals
also
the
team
played
better
defense
although
not
great
than
in
the
regular
season
fuhr
deserves
a
lot
of
credit
but
not
all
of
it
robert
a
i
agree
with
this
i
also
think
fuhrs
contribution
for
sabress
win
is
just
the
same
as
many
palyers
in
the
team
mogilny
had
six
goals
in
four
games
including
two
goals
for
the
great
comeback
in
the
final
win
after
fuhr
had
left
the
key
for
sabress
win
over
boston
is
whole
teams
strong
commitment
as
an
underdog
and
all
their
talent
players
including
mogilny
and
fuhr
i
think
that
grant
fuhr
deserves
more
credit
than
that
while
its
true
that
the
entire
sabres
team
played
very
well
i
still
believe
that
if
it
wasnt
for
grant
fuhr
the
series
would
now
be
tied
he
virtually
stole
games
and
for
the
sabres
in
both
of
these
games
fuhr
stood
on
his
head
to
give
the
sabres
the
chance
to
win
especially
in
game
fuhr
made
a
series
of
huge
stops
in
the
third
period
when
the
score
was
tied
even
in
game
when
the
sabres
won
the
score
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
sabres
dominated
however
if
it
hadnt
been
for
fuhr
the
sabres
wouldnt
have
been
up
i
think
it
was
through
the
period
and
the
bruins
wouldnt
have
had
to
open
up
the
game
thereby
allowing
mogilny
to
score
the
third
goal
on
a
breakaway
to
salt
away
the
game
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
fuhr
was
the
critical
factor
in
the
victory
in
my
opinion
neely
oates
and
juneau
played
as
well
as
lafontaine
mogilny
and
hawerchuk
the
sabres
did
get
extraordinary
efforts
from
hannan
sweeney
wood
and
khmylev
compared
to
that
of
the
bruins
checkers
however
the
bruins
defense
imo
played
better
than
the
sabres
defense
the
sabres
have
ken
sutton

none

will
ever
know
the
real
inside
story

from
what
i
know
a
group
of
minneapolis
businessmen
told
green
repeatedly
that
they
would
purchase
the
remaining
season
tickets
to
get
to
the
level
that
green
wanted
yet
he
refused
every
time
its
pretty
obvious
that
he
was
determined
to
get
out
of
minneapolis
at
any
cost
and
use
the
season
tickets
thing
as
an
excuse
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
to
the
penultimate
game
and
the
fans
were
great
people
were
tailgating
and
playing
roller
hockey
in
the
parking

before
the
game
the
attendance
was
so
full
as
to

the

re
minnesota
shame
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
norman
green
claims
that
he
has
lost
money
over
the
last
three
years
that
he
has
owned
the
team
when
he
bought
the
team
it
seemed
kind
of
obvious
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
deal
with
a
few
years
in
the
red
before
the
team
started
making
a
profit
again
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
willing
to
do
so
he
claimed
two
years
ago
that
the
team
needed
to
average
only
fans
per
game
in
order
to
pull
a
profit
but
this
season
the
team
averaged
fans
despite
increasd
ticket
prices
i
think
the
teams
attendence
and
play
was
clearly
in
an
upward
trend
which
leaves
me
dumbfounded
as
to
how
he
could
ignore
that
in
deciding
to
move
he
was
even
offered
the
many
concessions
he
rudely
demanded
such
as
guaranteed
season
ticket
sales
cheap
rent
at
the
other
two
arenas
in
town
etc
oh
well
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
green
wanted
immediate
huge
returns
in
dallas
and
wasnt
willing
to
wait
another
year
or
so
in
mn
dallas
gave
green
a
pretty
stellar
deal
to
play
there
although
i
feel
minnesotas
was
quite
reasonable
and
he
also
has
some
cronies
down
there
as
well
all
this
means
is
that
minnesota
is
without
an
nhl
team
for
a
year

two

about
how

will
cremeate
the

is

its

you
make
more
of
a
fool
of

im
not

anything
about
the
canucks
they
are
up
and
are
coming
back
home
but
im
not
going

any
it
around
until
the

is
wrapped

bravo

i
too
am
sick
of
all
the

jets
fans
who
could
prpbably
predict
the
end
of
the
world
more
accurately
than
the
coutcome
of
a
playoff
series
now
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
mindless
fanatica
blind
faith
canucks
fan
but
unlike
those
from
winterpeg
i
do
not
need
to
vent
my
spleen
upon
the
world
as
to
how
great
my
team
is
i
know
i
have
confidence
in
them
and
thats
enough
granted
the
jets
finished
the
season
hot
and
the
canucks
were
having
trouble
but
vancouver
has
built
themselves
a
reputation
for
being
a
playoff
team
just
ask
any
flames
fan
they
may
not
win
every
series
but
they
alway
fight
to
the
end
ill
admit
that
last
year
was
not
great
but
if
they
combine
the
work
ethic
of
the
past
with
the
new
tallent
of
the
present
they
will
be
tough
to
beat
note
i
did
not
say
they
would
pummel
every
team
they
meet
and
destroy
the
greatest
player
playing
today
now
like
any
canucks
fan
i
would
love
to
see
them
take
the
cup
i
feel
they
have
a
good
chance
to
make
it
out
of
the
smythe
and
a
shot
at

i
cant

the
typo
i
meant
the

plays

and
the
leafs
none
as
well
my
point
isnt
that
the
refs
were
biased
just
that
they
were
calling
a
lot
of
penalties
which
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
wings
having
the
ref
call
a
whole
bunch
of
penalties
against
one
team
then
calling
a
bunch
against
the
other
to
make
up
for
it
takes
a
lot
away
from
what
could
have
been
a
great

did

team
last

they
reached

now
after

no

and
even
no

after
the

it
seems
they
lost

were

it

hits
at
first
i
immediately
thought
and
a
game
because
the
hit
looked
much
more
severe
from
an
intenttoinjure
perspective
than
it
was
after
seeing
the
replay
id
say
it
deserved
minutes
for
boarding
it
was
careless
any
way
you
slice
it
if
stewart
had
replay
i
do
not
think
chaisson
would
have
gotten
and
the
game
in
the
second
period
behind
potvin
probert
had
the
puck
and
was
going
to
get
out
front
and
was
tackled
i
couldnt
believe
the
nocall
this
nocall
was
bullshit
i
agree
i
admire
stewart
for
letting
them
go
but
probert
looked
up
saying
where
the
hell
is
the
penalty
ive
never
seen
probert
whine
either
he
doesnt
need
to
now
if
probie
decides
to
put
wendel
through
the
boards
hes
probably
gone
right
i
dont
remember
who
on
the
leafs
touched
the
puck
on
racines
shot
towards
the
end
of
the
game
seconds
left
but
stewart
called
it
out
of
play
last
touched
by
detroit
everybody
in
the
garden
including
the
linesmen
knew
it
yzerman
protested
but
stewart
just
laughed
and
really
homered
the
wings
this
was
also
bullshit
but
once
again
no
replay
it
was
rouse
btw
im
really
pissed
that
the
linesmen
didnt
correct
the
call
eitherits
bs
when
the
officials
refuse
to
admit
they
made
a
mistake
but
when
it
all
comes
down
to
it
wings
played
like
shit
yes
the
calls
you
describe
should
not
have
the
difference
in
a
detroit
loss
i
picked
the
leafs
to
win
game
on
emotion
and
adrenalin
but
the
wings
have
no
excuses
for
game
they
should
be
the
superior
team
the
call
that
pissed
me
off
the
most
was
anderson
getting
for
putting
his
stick
in
somebodys
eye
that
was
the
most
dangerous
stick
infraction
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
and
everybody
in
the
damn
league
knows
hes
an
asshole
when
it
comes
to
stickwork
four
lousy
minutes
bullshit
call
murray
should
send
the
tape

finlandnorway
in
wc
finns
had
to
do
their
best
last
night
when
they
played
against
norway
in
world
champs
after
two
periods
the
score
was
still
this
game
was
quite
much
similar
to
the
first
game
finland
played
against
france
the
norwegian
goalie
was
very
good
and
a
bit
lucky
too
in
the
third
period
juha
riihijrvi
scored
from
a
rebound
the
time
was
around
mins
or
so
the
second
goal
was
scored
by
kari
harila
who
shot
straight
from
a
faceoff
behind
the
nowwegian
goalie
saku
koivu
the
center
got
his
first
point
of
this
tournament
saku
koivu
played
very
well
througout
the
game
and
he
was
awarded
the
best
player
of
the
game
prize
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
quite
small
in
size
he
handles
the
puck
very
well
and
is
a
fast
skater
i
think
that
we
will
hear
from
this
guy
in
the
future
subject
re

letter
quite
long
in
catchernetcomcom
paul
w
francisco
writes
as
she
said
the
letter
is
addressed
to
bettman
the
post
which
though
having
pretty
much
the
same
content
is
an
entirely
different
entity
was
addressed
to
all
when
she
puts
the
letter
in
the
mail
i
doubt
it
will
say
to
all
i
figure
she
wanted
to
let
people
here
see
what
was
in
it
since
it
is
a
topic
that
interests
a
lot
of
folks
here
thats
an
entirely
different
purpose
than
sending
the
letter
to
bettman
and
it
is
a
damn
good
thing
that
she
did
post
it
since
she
claims
to
represent
people
in
recsporthockey
unfortunately
the
largest
computer
networks
in
the
world
phrase
is
a
definition
of
the
internet
not
a
group
as
a
whole
that
she
claims
to
represent
as
her
sole
purpose
in
mentioning
the
net
as
steve
gallichio
has
already
pointed
out
is
to
lend
weight
to
her
points
through
association
with
the
internet
there
is
no
other
reason
to
mention
the
internet
this
is
misrepresentation
and
if
the
internet
was
a
private
corporation
alison
would
be
leaving
herself
wide
open
to
all
kinds
of
civil
suits
for
the
business
of
whether
or
not
it
is
large
it
is
large
compared
to
say
the
number
of
folks
on
rsh
who
are
sending
a
letter
to
thank
him
for
changing
the
names
at
least
to
this
point
and
just
for
my
this
is
not
a
letter
it
is
a
petition
claiming
to
represent
a
large
proportion
of
recsporthockey
users
and
by
implication
a
significant
number
of
internet
users
names
can
in
no
way
be
considered
a
large
proportion
of
recsporthockey
which
while
we
have
no
way
of
counting
actual
readership
is
accessible
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
persons
is
no
more
than
a
flys
fart
in
a
windstorm
own
curiosity
i
thought
id
look
up
the
official
definition
of
large
in
the
dictionary
it
reads
large
having
more
than
usual
power
capacity
or
scope
exceeding
most
other
things
of
like
kind
in
quantity
or
size
gee
you
looked
up
large
in
the
dictionary
what
next
two
syllable
words
now
i
have
no
idea
how
many
letters
bettman
may
have
gotten
on
the
issue
or
how
many
people
may
have
signed
them
people
may
be
up
there
thereby
validating
definition
i
would
also
wager
that
the
geographical
range
of
signatures
is
quite
large
which
would
give
it
a
large
scope
let
me
suggest
that
the
only
place
you
are
likely
to
envy
the
magnitude
of
is
when
you
are
looking
for
ways
to
beef
up
your
iq
scores
he
might
be
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
list
of
names
why
would
he
be
impressed
with
this
unless
it
were
large
as
i
said
he
might
be
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
list
of
names
but
it
would
have
to
be
considerably
larger
but
even
this
definition
does
not
account
for
the
original
context
from
which
you
lifted
this
sentence
i
personally
dont
know
whether
or
not
i
agree
with
the
letter
i
have
very
mixed
emotions
about
it
i
like
the
names
as
they
are
and
dont
think
they
make
it
that
difficult
to
learn
the
game
but
there
might
be
a
shred
of
validity
to
the
change
well
then
what
the
hell
is
your
point
you
dont
really
know
if
you
have
an
opinion
about
the
hockey
issue
but
you
do
know
that
you

this

to
put

its

anymore
the

are
a
puzzle
to
me
they
have
long
been

the
few
teams
i
always
dreaded
playing
their
d
isnt
quite
what
it
used
to
be

they
still
usually
play
us
pretty
tough
i
just
cant
figure
it
out
at
least
last
night
they
mounted
an
attack
watching
some
of
the
devils
players
being
interviewed
i
could
see
in
their
faces
and
eyes
that
they
really
dont
have
any
confidence
they
are
left
speechless
when
asked
what
more
they
can
to
do
to
beat
the
pens
they
act
as
though
they
know
its
a
hopeless
task
bernie

was
interviewed
after
game
on

late

he
was
shaking
his
head

disbelief
over
barrasso
saying
that
tommy
is
like
another
defenseman
out
there
and
how
difficult
it
is
playing
against
him
then
he
got
this
faraway
look
on
his
face
his
voice
started
trailing
off
and
he
said
it
just
isnt
rightit
just
isnt
fair
and
he
tried
to
muster
a
smile
im
really
impressed
with
bowmans
coaching
tactics
hes
had
an
answer
for
every
move
that
brooks
has
thrown

goes

has
also
scored

game

game

thoughts
on
game
the
flames
played
horribly
in
dropping
the
first
game
of
their
series
with
los
angeles
on
sunday
afternoon
they
seemed
more
interested
in
throwing
big
hits
than
in
scoring
goals
they
physically
dominated
the
kings
but
that
was
the
only
area
they
dominated
in
the
game
plan
was
to
rush
the
net
and
try
and
take
advantage
of
a
young
inexperienced
la
defence
and
the
shaky
kings
goaltending
but
those
plans
fell
by
the
wayside
while
the
flames
conducted
a
steady
march
to
the
penalty
box
particularily
stupid
was
theoren
fleury
taking
a
five
minute
major
and
a
game
misconduct
for
slamming
warren
rychels
face
into
the
dasher
while
rychel
was
on
his
knees
goaltender
mike
vernon
played
well
and
could
not
really
be
faulted
for
the
loss
despite
his
wellpublicized
poor
record
in
afternoon
games
he
got
very
little
support
from
his
defence
in
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
and
sweeping
away
rebounds
in
fact
marty
mcsorleys
goal
actually
went
in
off
chris
dahlquists
skate

net
thoughts
on
game
the
flames
came
back
strong
in
the
second
game
evidently
aware
of
the
potentially
fatal
consequences
of
losing
both
the
first
two
games
on
home
ice
the
first
period
was
fairly
even
with
the
edge
going
to
the
kings
but
calgary
came
out
strong
in
the
second
period
and
simply
dominated
the
kings
scoring
five
goals
to
take
a
lead
they
never
relinquished
en
route
to
a
win
the
deciding
factors
in
this
game
were
faceoffs
and
special
teams
calgary
dominated
on
faceoffs
as
they
did
in
game
but
they
were
able
to
make
better
use
of
the
won
faceoffs
in
this
game
than
they
did
in
the
first
one
calgary
also
went
on
the
powerplay
while
la
only
went
and
gave
up
a
shorthanded
goal
to
joel
otto
las
powerplay
goal
also
came
late
in
the
game
with
the
outcome
already
decided
the
kings
powerplay
failed
them
when
they
needed
it
most
in
the
and
periods
the
flames
lost

shoulder
injury

right
after

calgarys
goal
charlie
huddy
left
the
game
for
the
kings
with
a
groin
injury
the
game
was
marred
by
stupidity
in
the
last
minute
first
craig
berube
of
calgary
took
a
fiveminute
major
for
fighting
plus
a
game
misconduct
for
instigating
when
he
went
after
tony
granato
for
no
apparent
reason
granato
drew
a
minor
for
some
strange
reason
turtling
perhaps
this
was
followed
seconds
later
by
warren
rychel
drawing
a
major
minor
and
game
misconduct
for
hitting
frank
musil
in
the
face
with
his
stick
and
then
instigating
a
fight
musil
got
a
fighting
major
for
some
similarily
strange
reason
hardy
and
yawney
went
toetotoe
and
both
got
double
minors
gregson
thought
that
musil
turtling
amounted
to
fighting

virtually
everything
that
peter

course
we
cant
really
be
sure
of
this
pocklington
is
at
the
point
of
maximum
advantage
right
nowand
he
is
basically
right
in
that
northlands
which
is
a
creature
of
the
city
of
edmonton
must
give
him
a
better
deal
in
the
era
of
escalating
salaries
northlands
and
the
city
benefitted
as
much
as
he
did
during
the
eighties
from
the
oilersand
wealth
generated
by
the
oilers
success
was
sharedbut
the
finanical
viability
of
small
market
teams
has
radically
changed
in
the
space
of
a
couple
of
years
and
for
the
oilers
to
remain
viable
and
competitive
they
need
much
more
of
the
revenue
stream
from
concessions
parking
and
building
advertising
as
most
every
other
professional
sports
franchise
in
north
america
has
what
was
once
a
fair
agreement
that
shared
the
wealth
is
now
northlands
sucking
the
blood
out
of
the
oilers
franchise
the
oiler
rationale
regarding
the
renegotiation
of
player
contracts
is
that
a
deal
is
a
deal
sather
has
spouted
this
repeatedly
pocklinton
has
a
contract
with
northlands
until
a
deal
is
a
deal
perhaps
if
he
included
the
income
he
has
received
from
his
sale
of
assets
players
such
as
gretzky
and
the
income
he
has
received
in
expansion
fees
with
his
revenues
he
wouldnt
be
losing
money
he
has
admitted
pulling
this
money
out
of
the
oiler
franchise
to
put
into
his
other
businesses
the
oilers
have
paid
several
times
over
what
the
coliseum
cost
to
build
and
bring
edmonton
prestige
and
recognition
throughout
the
world
that
is
essentially
pricelessto
nickelanddime
the
oilers
just
so
northlands
can
use
revenue
sucked
out
of
the
oilers
to
subsidize
their
horseracing
operations
is
insanity
i
think
that
pocklington
has
received
ample
provincial
subsidization
i
cant
really
blame
him
for
going
after
municipal
subsidization
but
he
is
certainly
not
entitled
to
it
pocklington
has
sucked
revenue
out
of
the
oilers
in
order
to
prop
up
his
failing
business
interests
pocklington
is
not
to
be
trusted
i
doubt
very
much
that
any
oiler
team
will
ever
again
make
the
playoffs
under
pocklingtons
stewardship
as
soon
as
a
player
shows
himself
to
be
a
competent
nhler
and
expects
to
be
paid
accordingly
he
is
shipped
off

id
be
thanking
stewart
for

possible
quebecs
powerplay

lethal
and
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
have
a
penaltyfilled
game
where
they
can
clean
up
with
their
superior
powerplay
montreal
really
lost
that
game

game
because
patrick

well
on

to
having
another
one

what
is
the
policy
regarding

the
minor
league
playoffs
versus
wc
i
know
that
the
rangers
are
holding
back
kovalev
zubov
and
andersson
for
binghamton
but
i
also
know
that
the
whalers
wanted
michael
nylander
to
play
for
springfield
while
nylander
wanted
to
play
for
sweden
the
whalers
allowed
the
nhl
to
decide
and
the
nhl
chose
the
wcs
how
does
this
differ
from
the
rangers
and
oilers
did
the
whalers
have
to
go
through
the
league
or
could
they
have
forced
nylander
to
play
in
springfield
as
long
as
a
player
is
under
contract
to
an
organization
he
is
obligated
to
play
only
where
that
organization
tells
him
to
play
or
gives
him
permission
to
play
the
rangers
are
certainly
within
their
rights
to
force
zubov
and
andersson
to
report
to
binghampton
it
certainly
does
reflect
a
lack
of
class
on
the
part
of
the
ranger
organization
however
is
having
binghampton
win
the
calder
cup
really
more
important

keeping

tended
to
favour
leafs
a
couple
of
comments
on
gilmour
just
because
the
guy
isnt
one
of
the
three
stars
doesnt
mean
he
was
not
leading
the
team
someone
posted
the
playoff
point
total
and
hes
in
something
like
fifth
or
sixth
placeplus
he
walked
away
with
the
molson
cup
given
for
accumulating
points
from
the
three
star
selection
during
the
regular
season
on
the
officiating
ive
heard
gripes
from
both
ends
on
this
one
emotions
are
very
high
in
this
series
the
rivalry
is
one
of
the
stronger
ones
i
know
of
i
do
have
to
agree
that
the
officiating
last
night
was
proleaf
in
general
except
for
whoever
missed
that
slash
on
gilmours
hand
in
general
i
still
think
detroit
has
one
of
the
better
chances
vs
pittsburgh
though
i
think
the
leafs
would
do
better
against
the
bluesbut
not
as
well
if
they
made
it
out
of
the
division
problem
is
i
like
both
these
teams
though
im
supporting
the
leafs
on
the
underdog
principle
d
by

waygilmour
tiring
out
is
a

like

not
playing

the
hart
trophy
goes
to
the
player
most
valuable
to
his
team
not
to
the
best
player
in
the
league
so
your
above
arguement
is
really
worthless
personally
i
always
thought
that
most
valuable
to
his
team
was
silly
why
should
the
best
player
in
the
league
be
penalized
because
he
plays
on
a
team
with
other
good
players
why
should
a
lesser
player
be
picked
solely
because
hes
the
best
player
on
a
weak
team
wouldnt
the
weaker
team
be
helped
even
more
by
the
best
player
in
the
league
doesnt
the
presence
of
the
best
player
in
the
league
make
the
other
players
on
the
team
look
better
too
the
hart
trophy
was
orginally
awarded
in
a
time
where
people
did
not
think
in
terms
of
who
was
the
best
player
rather
in
terms
of
who
was
the
most
valuable
to
the
team
and
valuable
to
his
team
was
not
and
should
not
be
considered
synonymous
with
best
we
are
talking
about
a
time
when
honour
and
attitude
not
measurable
skills
were
the
most
important
assets
a
player
brought
to
his
team
his
league
and
his
sport
this
was
before
the
onslaught
of
professionalism
which
has
clearly
denigrated
what
was
formerly
the
foremost
peacetime
pursuit
of
glory
the
hart
trophy
is
not
a
prize
it
is
an
honour

re
blues
sweep
hawks
while
i
will
first
congratulate
the
blues
for
their
victory
i
think
it
must
be
realized
that
the
primary
reason
the
blues
were
able
to
win
was
curtis
joseph
when
a
goalkeeper
gets
hot
there
is
little
an
opposing
team
can
do
joseph
should
be
given
the
entire
city
of
st
louis
because
otherwise
there
would
probably
be
a
game
scheduled
as
for
the
game
on
sunday
the
blues
caught
a
few
breaks
without
a
doubt
one
was
the
referee
constantly
watching
the
blackhawks
looking
for
reasons
to
give
them
penalties
second
the
blues
first
goal
resulted
because
the
puck
hit
the
linesman
as
the
blackhawks
attempted
to
clear
no
linesman
no
shot
for
bretti
can
redirect
anythinghull
to
redirect
on
another
of
st
louis
goals
belfour
was
tripped
from
behind
as
he
went
to
make
the
save
by
someone
who
didnt
belong
in
the
crease
which
means
it
was
a
st
louis
player
finally
the
overtime
goal
was
caused
because
someone
kept
belfour
from
getting
back
to
the
crease
no
goalie
no
way
to
stop
the
shot
i
congratulate
st
louis
for
beating
the
hawks
it
will
be
a
shame
to
see
bryan
murray
finally
advance
to
the

joseph
wont

cheveldae

you
must

cheveldae
looks

an

which
he
probably
i

i
dont

of
too
many
or
string
goalies
that
could
post
over
wins
in

chevy
has
done
that
the
past
two
seasons
playing
behind
a
defense
that
is
not
exactly
the
best
in
the
league
his
wins
this
year
were
not
all
against
toronto
and
for
those
who
look
at
vincent
rien
stats
and
think
he
should
be
starting
take
a
look
at
the
teams
he
played
against
teams
like
san
jose
ottawa
and
tb
any
nhl
goalie
could
post
a
decent
record
playing
teams
like
that
night
in
and
night
out
is
look
for
detroit
management
to
remedy
the
situation
in
the
offseason
i
really
dont
see
this
happening
if
they
didnt
think
cheveldae
could
do
the
job
they
would
of
traded
for
somebody
this
year
after
all
why
wait
until
next
year
when
there
were
goalies
available
this
year
hey
i
may
be
wrong
but
after
watching
him
kick
rebound
after
rebound
into
the
high
slot
i
dont
think
he
can
carry
them
in
the
tough
games
ie
those
not
against
toronto
better
to
kick
out
rebounds
than
to
let
goals
in
if
st
louis
gets
past
chicago
watch
for
joseph
to
carry
the
blues
past
an
otherwise
vastly
superior
red
wings
club
joseph
is
hot
but
so
are
the
wings
they
have
scored
six
goals
in
both
of
their
games
so
far
with
toronto
supposively
one
of
the
leagues
best
defenses
i

they

the
most
logical
trade
in

to
me
would
be
between
detroit

im
sure
if
beezer
would

he
would
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to

in

he
would
be
a
valuable
asset
to
the

perhaps
the

could
get
a
zombo
in
return
beezer
got
a

good

there
was

about
how

were

who
respect

no

ow
bad
they
are
thats
bullshit
anyone
who
would
follow
the
pens
or
the
pirates
in
parts
of
the
early
eighties
on
a
devoted
basis
are
losers
its
ok
to
follow
and
be
concerned
about
your
home
team
but
to
give
them
respect
even
when
it
is
clear
the
management
and
the
players
suck
should
not
be
required
of
a
true
fana
true
fan
would
follow
the
team
in
troubled
times
to
the
extent
that
they
could
discuss
how
to
improve
the
team
when
i
visit
pittsburgh
ill
refuse
to
go
to
a
pirates
game
since
i
think
the
management
has
given
pittsburgh
a
team
which
could
have
been
much
better
even
if
they
couldnt
sign
barry
bonds
lerts
say
the
pens
start
doing
to
their
own
team
what
the
oilers
have
done
this
year
and
what
the
whalers
have
done
in
recent
years
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
show
much
enthusiasm
for
the
team
ill
still
follow
it
and
bitch
about
it
but
i
wont
waste
my
money
on

he
noted

furthermore
he
also
informed

back

in

that
the

sitting

according

openly

this

i

i
was

a
very
strong

from

think
he
could
be

to
success
for
them
this

defensively
they
really
had
a
strong

hardly
heard
selannes

craven

highflying

thought

looked
overmatched

another

but
once

the
pattern
of

off
a

penetrating
the

imnsho
neither

if
the

record
did
not

year
before

finished

the

finished

and
points
with
a
couple
of
stanley
cups
thrown
in
it
was
at
this
point
the
pens
attendance
was
near
capacity
out
of
sellouts
yet
they
hadnt
made
the
playoffs
since
how
do
you
explain
a
place
team
breaking
attendance
records
when
they
havent
been
to
the
playoffs
in
years
mario
lemieux
is
the
explanation
imho
you
could
make
a
case
that
the
expectation
of
an
improving
team
that
would
make
the
playoffs
is
the
reason
funny
you
should
mention
itthis
is
exactly
the
case
i
was
going
to
make
but
i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had
a
point
season
and
was
the
first
nongretzky
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
since
people
turned
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fans
even
if
the
team
sucks
but
this
is
short
term
only
i
still
do
not
think
the
attendance
increase
will
last
unless
the
team
is
a
winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one
pittsburgh
was
still
getting
better
so
people
continued
to
support
them
if
they
suddenly
dropped
to
say
points
youd
have
knee
surgery
for
some
of
the
people
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
also
the
following
year
the
pens
had
points
not
ok
my
numbers
came
from
the
nhl
guide
and
record
book
they
made
the
transaction
to
try
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improvement
in
attendance
came
before
they
started
doing
this
coffey
late
in
and
before
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubling
of
attendance
occured
in
from
the
previous
year
an
increase
from
points
to
points
is
not
going
to
do
that
the
arrival
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
you
can
give
the
credit
to
mario
since
he
deserves
it
but
my
point
is
that
it
wasnt
mario
himself
but
it
was
the
expectation
of
things
to
come
ie
a
winning
team
that
he
created
by
being
the
next
great
hockey
superstar
and
before
anybody
jumps
in
and
says
im
nitpicking
and
mincing
words
go
back
and
read
from
where
this
thread
started
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fans
mind
who
suddenly
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pens
was
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amazing
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
was
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
ass
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
was
the
latter
similar
thing
happened
in
la
before
gretzkys
arrival
about
per
game
after
constant
sellouts
they
are
still
selling
out
every
game
despite
showing
little
or
no
improvement
since
gretzkys
first
year
there
how
do
you
explain
it
people
are
going
to
see
gretzky
they
certainly
arent
going
to
see
a
winner
they
havent
got
a
winner
theyve
had
much
better
teams
in
their
past
history
than
they
currently
have
yet
they
didnt
draw
as
well
then
i
dont
think
this
is
accurate

tickets
sell
but
people
dont
go
to
the
games
i
think
this
thread
has
already
been
discussedseason
ticket
holders
in
la
dont
always
use
their
tickets
so
in
effect
after
the
kings
initial
success
following
gretzkys
arrival
to
points
same
source
and
corresponding
attendance
jump
there
has
been
an
effective
drop
in
attendance
even
though
ticket
sales
may
not
have
changed
much
whether
or
not
the
kings
are
a
winner
is
debatable
i
claim
that
since
gretzkys
arrival
they
have
at
the
very
least
been
competitivei
also
claim
that
mcnall
has
made
a
stupid
move
in
trying
to
reassemble
the
oiler
dynastybut
thats
another
story
and
included
only
because
i
dont
like
mcnall
anyway
mcnall
did
do
some
heavy
marketing
around
gretzky
and
that
undoubtedly
was
also
responsible
for
the
attendance
and
merchandising
sales
etc
but
as
i
said
when
the
kings
have
been
in
there
little
tailspins
over
the
past
couple
of
years
there
have
been
empty
seats
at
the
forum
even
if
the
tickets
were
sold
i
think
in
the
case
of
a
lemieux
or
gretzky
the
player
can
transcend
winning
as
the
major
drawing
power
for
the
short
term
imo
although
i
think
that
its
inevitable
that
the
team
will
improve
with
a
player
such
as
lemieux
or
gretzky
simply
because
they
make
people
around
them
better
but
winning
sure
as
hell
helps
well
at
least
we
are
in
full
agreement
here
this
does
not
make
rogers
point
any
more
valid
but
the
jets
arent
so
are
you
saying
roger
has
ever
had
a
valid
point
couldnt
resist
getting
a
huge
jump
in
productivity
yet
they
are
getting
a
huge
jump
in
attendance
this
is
due
to
the
emergence
of
teemu
selanne
they
have
the
best
record
in
hockey
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
because
they
are
winning
yes
but
they
are
doing
no
worse
than
last
year
i
think
the
same
type
of
reasoning
i
applied
to
a
new
pittsburgh
fan
applies
to
all
the
extra
people
showing
up
at
winnipeg
games
its
difficult
to
predict
but
do
you
think
that
if
the
jets
miss
the
playoffs
next
season
that
in
the
year
after
they
will
maintain
their
attendance
levels
i
seriously
doubt
it
because
in
that
case
the
expectation
of
an
improving
team
would
be
gone
with
or
without
selanne
i
did
provide
the
example
of
rocket
ismail
and
the
toronto
argonauts
of
the
cfldid
you
leave
it
out
because
you
dont
know
much
about
the
cfl
if
thats
the
case
then
fair
enough
but
if
it
isnt
the
case
then
im
curious
to
hear
your
explanation
subject
re
nhl
team
leaders
in
in
article
maynardramseycslaurentianca
roger
maynard
writes
the
jets
use
the
breakaway
pass
scheme
to
create
a
scoring
sensation
in
order
to
generate
interest
if
teams
score
as
many
or
more
goals
against
winnipeg
when
selanne
is
on
the
ice
as
winnipeg
scores
when
he
is
on
the
ice
then
i
cant
see
how
his
contribution
can
be
described
as
impressive
implicitly
you
are
assuming
that
goals
scored
against
winnipeg
with
selanne
on
the
ice
can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a
forward
winnipeg
has
a
lousy
defensive
record
anyway
lets
put
it
another
way
john
cullens
is
terrible
whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
feed
selanne
it
is
to
win
and
feeding
selanne
does
not
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
winning
knowledgeable
hockey
observers
the
world
over
would
agree
that
feeding
selanne
so
he
can
score
does
contribute
in
a
meaningful
way
to
winning
pat
burns
wouldnt
have
a
goal
suck
like
this
on
his
team
youre
worried
about
teemu
when
you
have
glenn
anderson
on
your
team
we
dont
know
what
selanne
does
best
we
do
know
what
jets
management
wants
and
again
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
allow
selanne
to
do
what
he
does
best
it
is
to
win
hockey
games
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
nope
didnt
see
it
i
was
too
busy
watching
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
his
goal
subject
re
this
years
biggest
and
worst
opinion
i
can
only
comment
on
the
kings
but
the
most
obvious
candidate
for
pleasant
surprise
is
alex
zhitnik
he
came
highly
touted
as
a
defensive
defenseman
but
hes
clearly
much
more
than
that
great
skater
and
hard
shot
though
wish
he
were
more
accurate
in
fact
he
pretty
much
allowed
the
kings
to
trade
away
that
huge
defensive
liability
paul
coffey
kelly
hrudey
is
only
the
biggest
disappointment
if
you
thought
he
was
any
good
to
begin
with
but
at
best
hes
only
a
mediocre
goaltender
a
better
choice
would
be
tomas
sandstrom
though
not
through
any
fault
of
his
own
but
because
some
thugs
in
toronto
decided
to
threaten
his
career
in
order
to
avoid
conceding
a
goal
other
than
that
the
award
goes
to
robert
lang
an
uninspiring
czech
robitaille
could
easily
be
mvp
but
id
prefer
to
give
it
to
rob
blake
who
is
quietly
becoming
one
of
the
leagues
premier
defensemen
and
if
the
kings
manage
to
hold
onto
him
and
the
rest
of
our
young
defense
it
could
one
day
mean
that
well

in

last

leafs
game
vs
the
devils
was
a
nailbitter
let
me
tell
you
it
was
a
well
played
game
by
both
teams
i
thought
but
according
to
the
don
and
ron
it
was
the
an
offnight
for
the
leafs
and
the
devils
were
outplaying
toronto
well
i
beg
to
differ
imho
clark
deserved
to
be
a
first
star
as
much
as
gilmour
did
his
fast
breaks
towards
the
net
and
the
good
opportunites
that
he
created
reminded
me
of
the
clark
of
old
but
not
to
take
any
of
the
credit
away
from
gilmour
i
think
the
leafs
are
playing
great
hockey
why
well
first
look
at
their
injury
list
which
includes
cullen
ellet
zezel
macoun
of
course
my
question
is
thishow
will
the
leafs
fare
when
they
are
once
again
healthy
if
they
are
playing
this
well
so
far
second
just
look
at
their
standings
still
second
in

moved

overall
to

i

well
as

we
see
that
the
race
for

in
the

has
truly
begun
and
it
will
be
a
very
close
race
between
chicago
and
toronto
and
the
best
game
of
the
season
will
probably
be
their
last
against
each
other

anyone

looking
at
the
way
the
divisions
were
realigned
there

six

in

and
pacific
smyth
divisions
while
there
are
seven
teams
each
in
the
northeast
adams
and

divisions
the
thought
occurs
to
me
that
inherent
in
the
realignment
is
expansion
of
one
team
in
the
central
division
and
one
team
in
the
pacific
division
although
ive
seen
nothing
published
that
indicates
that
actually
when
the
nhl

committee
was
formed
a
couple
of
years
back
before
the

expansion
john

will
have
to
wait

the

they

a

one
for

thankfully
they
abandoned
it
in

of
black
before
the

began
one
reason
that
the
wha
abandoned
the
blue
puck
was
the
fact
that
it
crumbled
very
quickly
during

the
blue
dye
that
was

somehow
affected
the

rubber
of

hi
according
to
my
always
questionable
newspaper
theres
a
silver
dollar
being
minted
in
canada
the
back
of
which
commemorates
the
anniversary
of
the
stanley
cup
now
i
know
full
well
what
coins
are
used
every
day
in
canada
i
can
easily
fish
a
few
out
of
my
pocket
change
right
now
in
fact
my
question
is
since
the
loon
is
the
only
dollar
coin
that
i
know
is
legal
tender
is
this
just
a
commemorative
coin
with
no
monetary
exchange
value
or
what
is
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
only
hockey
buffs
and
coin
collectors
might
covet
with
no
chance
of
it
being
circulated
if
it
is
an
uncirculated
coin
whats
the
current
cost
and
whats
its
potential
value
just
curious
if
no
one
knows
ill
take
this
to
socculturecanada
and
reccollecting
or
whatever
it
is

i
will
grant
that
a

like
mario
will
draw
fans
even
if
the

sucks
but
this
is

i

youd
have
knee

for
some
of
the
people
jumping
off

i
disagree
mcnall
has
demonstrated
with
gretzky
that
a
star
brings
out
the
crowds
whether
or
not
the
team
is
expected
to
do
well
very
few
fans
real
istically
expect
the
kings
to
do
well
this
year
although
i
do
and
yet
they
still
go
out
to
see
gretzky
this
is
the
marketing
strategy
selling
the
game
by
selling
the
stars
that
is
employed
by
baseball
and
notably
the
nba
and
this
is
the
attitude
that
the
new
bettmanmcnall
leadership
is
bringing
to
the
league
they
have
gone
on
record
as
stating
that
they
are
trying
to
sell
the
game
on
its
stars
timo
salami
and
brett
hull
are
perfect
examples
of
players
that
real
fans
know
arent
worth
a
damn
and
yet
being
benificiaries
of
marketingoriented
coaching
strategies
have
goal
totals
that
would
indicate
to
the
casual
observer
the
very
fans
the
nhl
wants
to
attract
that
these
players
are
indeed
superstars
they
made
the
transaction
to
try
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improvement
in
attendance
came
before
they
started
doing
this
coffey
late
in
and
before
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubling
of
attendance
occured
in
from
the
previous
year
an
increase
from
points
to
points
is
not
going
to
do
that
the
arrival
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fans
mind
who
suddenly
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pens
was
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amazing
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
was
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
ass
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
was
the
latter
it
aint
nearly
so
simple
as
this
the
casual

doesnt
think
about

fair

if

the

can

he
is
a

winnipeg
has
a

anyway
lets
put

john

whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont

neither
do
selannes
are
you
comparing
cullen

i
would
say
that
that
is
valid
if
winnipeg
is
such
a
lousy
defensive
team
then
why
the
hell
does
salami
stand
around
the
other
teams
blueline
when
the
puck
is
in
his
own
end
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
feed
selanne
it
is
to
win
and
feeding
selanne
does
not
contribute
in
any
meaningful
way
to
winning
knowledgeable
hockey
observers
the
world
over
would
agree
that
feeding
selanne
so
he
can
score
does
contribute
in
a
meaningful
way
to
winning
excuse
me
are
the
jets
playing
hockey
let
me
checkyes
but
just
barely
they
have
allowed
more
goals
than
they
have
scored
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
salamis
to
me
sounds
like
they
would
be
just
as
well
off
or
better
if
he
played
the
solid
twoway
game
that
our
friends
in
finland
claim
he
is
capable
of
but
if
he
did
that
he
wouldnt
be
chal
lenging
for
the
league
lead
in
goals
would
he
the
biplanes
might
be
challenging
for
first
however
youre
worried
about
teemu
when
you
have
glenn
anderson
on
your
team
now
lets
seeyou
have
compared
timo
to
anderson
and
cullen
whos
next
mike
foligno
we
dont
know
what
selanne
does
best
we
do
know
what
jets
management
wants
and
again
the
object
of
the
exercise
is
not
to
allow
selanne
to
do
what
he
does
best
it
is
to
win
hockey
games
what
he
does
best
is

i
refer
you

my
comment
above
some
of
our
finnish
friends
who
have
watched
him
play
claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
style
of
contribution
would
be
more
conducive
to
winning
or
dont
you
think
so
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
nope
didnt
see
it
i
was
too
busy
watching
foligno
jump
up
and
down
after
his
goal
i
dont
believe
it
you
did
compare
him
to
foligno
and
i
honestly
hadnt
read
this
far
it
would
help
if
you
used
a
little
discrimination
in
your
thinking
your
contributions
would
be

okay
you
hockey
playing
fansfinatics
out
there
im
looking
over
the
wide
range
of
aluminum
sticks
for
the
first
time
ive
been
playing
with
pieces
of
lumbar
that
seem
to
weigh
alot
and
break
after
a
few
uses
so
im
thinking
of
changing
to
an
aluminum
shaft
so
when
i
break
the
blade
all
i
have
to
do
is
change
it
the
problem
is
that
there
is
such
a
wide
reange
of
models
and
selections
out
there
that
im
not
certain
which
to
consider
can
any
of
you
post
some
of
your
suggestions
and
experiences
with
the
aluminum
sticks
what
is
the
difference
between
models
what
do
you
likedislike
about
them
and
which
brands
are
best
ive
had
and
still
have
a
few
aluminum
sticks
i
got
my
first
when
i
was
a
christian
and
broke
the
shaft
halfway
through
the
season
two
years
later
i
bought
another
a
canadian
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
season
and
i
still
have
it
i
also
have
an
easton
that
a
friend
was
getting
rid
off
after
giving
up
the
game
i
find
that
easton
blades
are
easier
to
get
but
all
brands
of
blades
are
pretty
well
interchangeable
watch
out
for
dried
up
bits
of
firewood
that
some
stores
pass
off
as
blades
in
my
experiences
the
blades
of
an
aluminum
break
more
often
than
regular
sticks
but
ive
only
ever
broken
one
aluminum
shaft
i
like
aluminum
sticks
the
blades
are
quickly
changed
even
on
the
bench
if
you
have
to
on
the
downside
the
shaft
wont
break
if
you
decide
to
impale
yourself
on
it

i
was
thinking
about
who
on

of

were
the

biggest
surprises

biggest
disappointments
this

now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all

the

anyway
team

disappointment
edmonton
oilers
manson
buchberger
mellanby
well
since
the
oilers
didnt
win
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
games
im
not
sure
they
deserve
and
mvp
cant
win
without
him
however
id
suggest
kelly
buchberger
instead
of
dave
manson
who
has
had
a
brutal
year
his
pick
for
the
allstar
game
notwithstanding
as
for
biggest
surprise
id
say
that
buchberger
had
higher
expectations
this
year
due
to
his
breakthrough
year
for
him
last
year
so
he
didnt
really
raise
his
game
my
suggestion
would
be
shjon
podein
one
of
the
callups
from
cape
breton
during
the
year
he
was
quite
far
down
on
the
depth
chart
in
the
oilers
stable
of
prospects
but
made
a
big
impact
on
the
team
he
has
goals
in
his
games
and
is
only
those
are
decent
numbers
for
a
thirdline
player
who
was
seemingly
doomed
to
minorleague
oblivion
the
oilers
coaching
staff
likens
his
style
to
john
tonelli
i
think
hell
be
on
the
fulltime
roster
next
year
as
for
biggest
disappointment
you
could
name
any
of
the
players
the
oilers
dumped
for
lousy
production
this

nicholls

i
was
wtahcing
right
guard
hockey
week
on
tsn
yesterday
and
they
had
a
feature
on
this
guy
that
does
a
lot
most
of
the
masks
for
nhl
goalies
they
talked
about
how
they
are
made
what
they
are
made
of
and
the
designs
that
are
put
on
them
etc
actually
this
part
was
really
interesting
it
turns
out
that
the
mask
is
customfit
to
the
goalies
face
the
goalie
puts
hisher
face
through
a
piece
of
wood
or
was
it
plastic
with
a
hole
in
it
that
allows
only
the
face
and
forehead
to
show
hair
is
covered
by
a
cap
eyes
are
covered
by
a
plastic
wraptype
material
and
vaseline
is
put
on
the
goaltenders
face
then
a
plaster
is
spread
on
their
cheeks
forehead
and
chin
which
takes
about
minutes
to
dry
sufficiently
when
it
dries
it
is
effectively
a
mold
of
the
goalies
face
this
is
used
as
the
basis
of
the
mask
the
rest
involves
padding
the
inside
hardening
the
exterior
fitting
the
cage
etc
etc
john
blue
of
the
bruins
actually
demonstrated
the
procedure
on
the
show
he
exhibited
a
couple
masks
he
is
currently
working
on
namely
a
new
mask
for
andy
moog
which
is
a
basic
reworking
of
his
current
mask
with
the
bear
on
it
and
new
mask
for
bob
essensa
which
was
really
cool
the
jets
logo
was
on
the
chin
and
there
were
two
fighter
jets
on
either
side
on
the
forehead
with
an
airbrushed
background
yeah
essensas
mask
looked
really
good
the
best
one
of
all
was
one
he
never
talked
about
he
just
held
it
up
it
has
the
current
leafs
crest
on
the
chin
and
an
awesome
looking
black
panther
on
the
forehead
it
has
to
be
a
new
mask
for
felix
potvin
but
he
never
said
whose
it
was
actually
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
that
it
was
potvins
for
certain
i
would
bet
money
on
it
either
wayand
it
did
look
awesome

stuff
he
says

to

hes
moreorless

he
crossed

according
to

the

wasnt

there
were
some

alpo

don
noted
that
musil
wasnt

of

didnt
score
many
goals
last

he
also
made
fun
of
their
names
one
guy
has
a

like

the
other
like

this
is

the

letting
him
get
away
with
this
nonsensemaking
fun
of

its
bad
enough
that
he
makes
asinine
blanket
statements
about
european
players
but
hes
now
resorted
to
making
fun
of
their
names
too
he
sounded
like
an

much
like
he
did
last
week
when
he
said

until
he
dropped

don
said

names
well
what
he
said
was
that
even
though
hes
been

for

he
still

hello

the

and
ottawa
will
give
its

if
this
is

it
will
most

depend
on
whether

ottawa
gets

overall
can
ottawa
afford

personally
i
cant

philli
giving

lindros
for
anything
they
didnt
give

that
much
to
quebec
just
to
trade
him
away
again
not
to
mention
that
lindros
seems
to
be
a
huge
draw
in

and
that
he
represents

for

you
only
count
the

in

therefore
quebec
cannot
possibly
be
ahead
of
montreal

theres
probably
only
one
game
that
counts

many
europeans
in
nhl
ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
im
all

the
creation
of

the
bures

the

remark
was
a

carried

but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north

league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their

with
the
numbers

loved

he
was
on

when
i
first
got
hooked
on
hockey
back
in

so
no
he
wasnt
always
spot
on

and
he
wasnt

those

that

no

we

rode

of
gretzky
and
the

on

my

saw
the

sweep
them
but
ill
never
forget
the
night
a
year
later
when
the

closed
it
out
at

in
the

the

that

it
sounds

that
early
for

will
always
bring

since
then
ive
grown
a

more

the

winnipeg
will
move
into

by

the

winner
will

it
will
be
a

easier
to
build

against

like

whoever
plays
the
kings
in

will
take

i

winner
vancouver
canucks
ill
have

on

i

vancouver
will
go

goes
and
if
he
continues
on
his

scoring
slump
then
they
wont
even
make
it

i

will
make

regardless
of
who

play
they
seem
to
be
doing
pretty
well
even
with

game
against

on

i

itll
be

calgary

to

go
on
to
the

finals
wales
conference

islanders

i

in

a

for
vancouver
maybe
in

but
definately
not
stanley

and
vancouver
islanders
will
have
nothing
left
by
this

and
will
succumb
fairly
easily
to

stanley

vancouver
canucks
still

eklund
fencesittinglook
at
phillys
record
with
eric
and
without
there
is
no
doubt
soderstrom
is
probably
the
biggest
surprise
re
eric
true
but
fortunately
we
didnt
get
to
find
out
what
they
would
be
like
without
recchi
for
games
soderstrom
absolutely
shutouts
in
games
for
a
rookie
without
a
lot
of
defense
in
front
of
him
runnerups
to
galley
and
fedyk
who
are
scoring
a
ton
over
their
career
best
but
galley
thinks
hes
paul
coffey
puts
scoring
ahead
of
defending
and
fedyk
has
tailed
off
big
time
eklund
was
a
big
question
mark
this
year
and
was
coming
off
injuries
points
in
games
is
not
bad
at
all
and
recently
hes
been
a
huge
factor
in
the
wins
theyve
gotten
eklund
has
never
had
a
point
a
game
season
in
his
career
his
production
is
very
typical
for
him
how
does
he
qualify
as
a
disappointment
if
anything
hes
a
surprise
my
choice
would
be
roussel
if
i
went
strictly
by
what
was
expected
of
players
but
i
never
thought
that
he
had
what
it
takes
to
be
a
goalie
my
biggest
disappointment
is
bill
dineen
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
the
perfect
coach
for
this
young
team
instead
hes
made
too
many
bad
moves
and
imho
has
cost
them
enough
games
to
keep
them
out
of
the
playoffs
this
year
any
coach
that
thinks
putting
eric
lindros
at
the
point
on
power
plays
is
a
bright
idea
needs
to
go
back
to
coaching
school

the
flyers
team
that
can
beat
any
team
on
any
night
showed
up
at
the
spectrum
sunday
night
and
dominated
the
maple
leafs
thoroughly
en
route
to
a
shutout
tommy
soderstrom
will
get
credit
for
the
shutout
but
he
barely
broke
a
sweat
until
the
third
period
as
the
flyers
defense
kept
the
leafs
from
mounting
any
serious
attack
injuries
pelle
eklund
is
daytoday
with
a
bruised
thigh
roster
moves
jason
bowen
was
added
to
the
lineup
for
his
first
nhl
game
jason
was
the
flyers
second
pick
in
the
first
round
overall
of
the
entry

old

game
summary
if
the
flyers
played
like
this
every
night
theyd
be
in
the
playoffs
this
year
the
flyers
hit
everything
that
moved
they
created
scoring
chance
after
scoring
chance
they
snuffed
out
everything
that
the
leafs
tried
to
do
jason
bowen
made
a
good
play
on
his
first
nhl
shift
that
almost
created
a
goal
he
had
the
puck
in
the
top
of
the
left
offensive
circle
all
alone
but
instead
of
taking
the
shot
he
found
brindamour
crashing
the
net
on
the
other
side
a
perfect
pass
and
a
good
shot
across
daren
puppas
body
should
have
been
a
goal
but
puppa
made
a
great
save
reading
the
play
garry
galley
gave
the
maple
leafs
ranked
power
play
the
first
chance
when
he
hooked
doug
gilmour
at
the
flyers
lowly
ranked
penalty
killing
unit
was
almost
flawless
the
entire
game
and
set
the
tone
on
this
kill
the
maple
leafs
got
almost
nothing
but
long
unscreened
shots
and
the
defense
swept
away
every
rebound
after
the
power
play
the
flyers
got
a
goal
on
an
ugly
play
rod
brindamour
gave
the
puck
to
greg
hawgood
at
the
right
point
and
he
sent
a
drive
at
the
net
puppa
made
the
save
and
kicked
the
rebound
right
into
the
feet
of
josef
beranek
and
bob
rouse
who
were
wrestling
in
the
slot
beranek
was
able
to
get
his
stick
on
the
puck
and
push
it
out
to
dineen
who
was
skating
into
the
slot
from
the
right
circle
and
he
lifted
a
backhander
over
puppa
for
a
flyers
lead
at
the
flyers
kept
the
pressure
on
and
puppa
was
the
only
leaf
keeping
the
flyers
from
building
on
their
lead
for
a
while
eventually
things
settled
down
and
defense
prevailed
each
team
got
an
occasional
scoring
chance
but
the
goalies
were
strong
bowen
started
giving
some
lindroslike
checks
in
his
own
corners
then
lindros
who
was
looking
to
avenge
a
hit
foligno
gave
him
thought
he
had
a
chance
to
even
the
score
he
had
foligno
lined
up
at
center
ice
leaned
into
him
and
rode
him
into
the
center
ice
boards
the
only
problem
was
that
foligno
was
a
little
far
from
the
boards
and
mike
mister
mcgeough
felt
that
it
warranted
a
boarding
call
at
the
leafs
couldnt
get
anything
going
on
the
power
play
as
the
flyers
were
very
aggressive
for
a
change
on
the
kill
with
time
running
out
in
the
period
recchi
carried
through
the
neutral
zone
and
handed
to
lindros
as
they
approached
the
leafs
blue
line
they
were
in
a
crowd
with
wendell
clark
and
jamie
macoun
lindros
tried
a
backhand
pass
to
recchi
through
the
feet
of
macoun
that
connected
to
recchi
but
then
clark
checked
recchi
off
the
puck
macoun
then
tried
to
clear
but
it
was
weak
and
went
right
to
mcgill
who
had
manned
the
point
he
drove
it
from
just
inside
the
blue
line
macoun
got
his
stick
on
it
and
deflected
it
past
his
own
goalie
at
shots
were
flyers
in
the
period
the
flyers
finally
got
their
first
chance
on
the
power
play
when
dave
andreychuk
tripped
up
rod
brindamour
in
his
offensive
zone
during
the
power
play
the
flyers
got
cheated
a
little
when
the
puck
popped
up
into
the
air
and
eric
gloved
it
down
but
mcgeough
thought
it
hit
his
stick
above
his
head
we
could
see
from
our
seats
at
the
other
end
of
the
ice
that
it
only
hit
his
glove
and
the
replay
confirmed
but
the
faceoff
went
to
the
other
end
as
time
was
running
out
in
the
advantage
lindros
found
galley
with
a
pass
across
the
goal
mouth
but
puppa
made
the
save
the
rebound
kicked
back
to
the
right
corner
where
recchi
picked
it
up
passed
it
out
to
eric
crashing
through
the
right
circle
and
eric
onetimed
past
puppa
at
with
the
assist
recchi
moves
past
bobby
clarkes
season
the
second
best

total
for

mike
eastwood
took
down
al
conroy
at
to
give
the
flyers
another
chance
on
the
power
play
not
much
pressure
before
garry
galley
ended
the
power
play
with
a
slash
at
not
much
happened
on
the
on
although
the
leafs
had
most
of
the
possession
the
flyers
smothered
the
leafs
short
power
play
tempers
flared
a
little
at
bowen
and
pearson
got
roughing
minors
keith
acton
got
a
bloody
face
dave
mcllwain
then
took
a
dive
and
got
greg
hawgood
a
hooking
minor
at
to
set
up
a
on
the
replay
showed
that
hawgoods
stick
stopped
making
contact
with
mcllwain
long
before
he
spun
around
and
fell
again
the
flyers
smothered
the
leafs
power
play
led
by
dimitri
yushkevich
bowen
made
a
thundering
hit
when
he
came
out
of
the
box
on
pearson
berehowski
tried
to
perplex
everybody
with
his
sloooowball
he
had
the
puck
at
the
point
and
just
trickled
a
pass
down
the
slot
he
made
all
the
flyers
look
silly
as
nobody
could
get
a
stick
on
it
and
it
got
to
gilmour
at
the
side
of
the
net
but
soderstrom
stoned
him
the
flyers
picked
things
up
offensively
after
the
kill
was
over
but
didnt
get
anything
home
shots
were
flyers
the
flyers
were
content
with
the
goal
lead
in
the
third
period
and
they
decided
that
if
tommy
wanted
a
shutout
he
was
going
to
have
to
work
for
it
a
little
the
flyers
got
most
of
the
scoring
chances
in
the
first
or
so
minutes
of
the
period
but
couldnt
get
past
puppa
then
the
leafs
got
tired
of
lindros
making
road
kill
out
of
them
and
tempers
flared
each
for
doug
gilmour
and
lindros
unsportsmanlike
conduct
and
each
for
glenn
anderson
and
mcgill
roughing
all
at
terry
carkner
then
took
a
kneeing
penalty
at
on
gilmour
again
the
flyers
smothered
the
leafs
power
play
at
about
the
minute
mark
dave
andreychuk
got
a
shot
away
from
his
left
circle
that
got
through
soderstrom
the
puck
was
rolling
on
its
side
and
as
luck
would
have
it
it
turned
away
from
the
net
instead
of
turning
towards
it
think
of
how
a
rolling
quarter
inevitably
starts
to
lean
one
way
or
the
other
seconds
later
rod
brindamour
tripped
up
gilmour
at
to
give
the
leafs
another
chance
on
the
power
play
on
the
advantage
after
soderstrom
stoned
andreychuk
while
lying
down
andreychuk
got
the
rebound
through
soderstrom
but
from
behind
the
net
and
it
went
straight
through
and
was
swept
away
by
one
of
his
defensemen
they
kept
the
pressure
on
but
soderstrom
was
equal
and
preserved
the
shutout
recchi
cross
checked
ken
baumgartner
to
get
tempers
hot
and
start
a
brawl
at
no
punches
thrown
recchi
got
the
initial
minor
krushelnyski
baumgartner
and
lindros
each
got
roughing
minors
at
rouse
and
beranek
expressed
their
mutual
dislike
for
each
other
and
got
each
for
slashing
to
set
up
another
on
mike
eastwood
shoved
down
ryan
mcgill
in
the
flyers
zone
as
they
were
battling
for
the
puck
and
while
mcgill
was
down
he
ran
his
stick
across
mcgills
face
the
flyers
were
not
happy
with
that
at
all
al
conroy
paired
up
with
berehowski
and
started
throwing
punches
upward
well
al
held
his
own
much
to
the
delight
of
the
crowd
each
got
a
couple
punches
in
before
going
down
in
a
head
and
al
got
a
standing
o
penalties
eastwood
cross
check
game
clark
carkner
each
berehowski
and
conroy
each
fighting
at
so
a
major
penalty
for
the
rest
of
the
game
for
the
flyers
the
had
no
interest
in
stting
on
the
lead
hawgood
galley
and
brindamour
played
catch
until
hawgood
found
dineen
all
alone
in
the
left
circle
he
controlled
the
puck
and
blasted
it
past
puppa
at
that
was
all
the
fireworks
tommy
soderstrom
would
not
face
another
shot
puppa
did
but
kept
the
flyers
off
the
board
flyers
shots
were
flyers
in
the
probably
the
strongest
game
ive
seen
from
the
flyers
since
the
all
star
break
shutout
number
for
soderstrom
all
since
tied
for
most
in
the
nhl
but
hes
played
fewer
games
than
belfour
or
the
goalie
i
cant
remember
that
hes
tied
with
next
up
its
the
winnipeg
selannes
tuesday
night
in
winnipeg
the
flyers
cannot
be
eliminated
if
they
win
but
a
loss
coupled
with
an
islander
win
that
night
in
washington
would
be
the
official
end
flyers
up
to
points
on
the
season
in
games
last
year
they
had
points
in
games
under
so
they
need
at
least
points
in
their
last
games
to
improve
on
that
only
by
percentage
points
under
in
is
better
than
under
in
tragic
number
holds
at
points
with
games
left
the
tragic
number
for
is
points
i
watched
the
rangers
blow
a
third
period
lead
at
home
to
lose
before
i
finished
this
up
why
points
instead
of
well
the
flyers
will
win
the
tiebreaker
if
they
catch
them
whereas
the
islanders
win
tie
breakers
against
the
flyers
and
so
need
only
a
tie
the
rangers
could
crumble
down
the
stretch
as
they
play
the
devils
the
pens
twice
the
flyers
and
finish
up
with
games
against
the
caps
so
i
guess
place
could
be
the
goal
for
the
team

you

with
selanne
on

can
be
blamed
on
himroger
he
is
a

winnipeg
has
a

lets

john
cullens

whats
your
excuse
for
him
that
his
powerplay
points
dont
count
neither
do
selannes
are
you
comparing
cullen
to
salami
i
would
say
that
that
is
valid
if
winnipeg
is
such
a
lousy
defensive
team
then
why
the
hell
does
salami
stand
around
the
other
teams
blueline
when
the
puck
is
in
his
own
end
i
thought
that
he
was
comparing
cullen
to
teemu
selnne
i
always
thought
that
salami
is
some
sort
of
sausage
but
if
you
dear
roger
are
able
to
see
salami
on
the
ice
playing
hockey
i
dont
know
what
to
do
but
you
surely
should
do
something
and
very
quickly
maybe
you
think
that
if
you
keep
on
talking
some
rubbish
after
some
time
everybody
will
consider
it
to
be
really
true
you
should
take
care
of
your
leafs
they
surely
need
it
more
what
he
does
best
is
scoreso
i
refer
you
to
my
comment
above
some
of
our
finnish
friends
who
have
watched
him
play
claim
that
he
can
play
a
solid
twoway
game
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
style
of
contribution
would
be
more
conducive
to
winning
or
dont
you
think
so
at
least
we
have
seen
him
playing
as
it
is
now
selanne
is
a
grandstanding
goal
suck
did
you
see
the
way
he
parades
around
with
his
arms
outstretched
after
scoring
a
goal
you
would
think
the
messiah
had
returned
during
the
latest
philly
game
the
leaf
players
didnt
parade
philly
crunched
them
maybe
you
need
some
more
two

players
who
can

i
was
thinking
about
who
on
each
of
the
teams
were
the
mvps
biggest
surprises
and
biggest
disappointments
this
year
now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
teams
the
same
amount
anyway
mvp
most
valuable
player
to
his
team
both
in
terms
of
points
and
in
terms
of
leadership
cant
win
without
him
biggest
surprise
the
player
who
rose
above
expectation
the
player
that
may
have
raised
the
level
of
his
game
to
a
new
height
even
if
that
new
level
doesnt
necessarily
warrant
an
allstar
berth
includes
those
players
who
at
the
outset
of
the
season
may
not
even
have
been
in
the
teams
plans
biggest
disappointment
the
player
from
whom
we
expected
more
eg
i
picked
denis
savard
in
montreal
because
with
the
new
emphasis
on
offence
brought
by
demers
shouldnt
savard
have
done

im
really
beginning

im
sure
the
future
will
turn
you
into
believers
too
after
the

will
abandond
icerinks
its
so
expensive
to
cool
down
the

in

and
the
locals
hardly
know
what

is
anyway
nhl
will
become
a
roller

hockey
league
that
way
it
can
create
more
public
interest
in
the
game
when
local
supporteres
can
play
the

in

yards
i
hope
im
just
out

there
wont
really

the

there

this

the

one

can
anyone
verify
this
i
forgot
the
exact
year
that
this
supposedly
occured
any
diehard
islander
fans
know
about
this
the
reason
why
i
am
asking
is
because
the

is
not
very
reliable
we
call
it
the

rauserfrasersfuca
richard
john
rauser
writes
ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
is
the
answer
as
simple
as
that
you
dislike
russians
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglass
so
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
and
where
would
canadian
hockey
be
today
without
the
europeans
dont
say
that
the
european
influence
on
the
league
has
been
all
bad
for
the
game
i
mean
look
at
the
way
you
play
these
days
less
fights
and
more
hockey
imho
canadian
hockey
has
had
a
positive
curve
of
development
since
the
when
the
game
was
more
brute
than
beauty
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
oh
look
you
dont
like
finns
either
i
just
dont
want
them

too
bad
almost
all

hmmm
and
what
kind
of
a

is
rauser
doesnt
sound
very
canadian
to
me
ps
when
analyzing
teams
like
italy
france
and
great
britain
you
find
that
a

of

ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
xenophobic
trash
deleted
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
if
youre
going
to
go
to
those
extremes
i
guess
youd
better
start
packing
because
unless
youre
a
native
north
american
this
isnt
your
continent
either

down

when
the
ball
was
in

the

the

went

that
said

lindros

playing

they

for

this

i
told

nothing

can
a

go

earn
a

then
come

lose

the

smith

wanted

you

ive
never
seen
a
game
where
one
player
has
committed
penalties
something
like
this
would
require
more
attention
by
the
referee
unsportsmanlike
contact
an
intentional

this
inlcludes
all
the
current
flavours
of
roughing

you
get

are

you
are
thrown

besides
the
penalty
shot
for
one
technical
if
the
team
gets
penalties
in
a
period
the
opposing
team
gets
a
penalty
shot
for
every
additional
one
until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
gets
two
shots
if
heshe
was
in
the
act
of
shooting
when
the
foul
ocured
this
works
well
for
several
reasons
first
penalty
shots
are
the
most
exciting
thing
in
hockey
right
so
it
follows
that
the
more
the
better
next
when
the
player
is
setting
up
for
a
penalty
shot
the
network
can
take
a
commercial
finally
with
only
three
penalties
the
network
announcers
don
meredith
dick
vitale
john
madden
pat
summerall
and
marv
levy
among
others
will
be
able
to
tell
the
viewers
what
happened
before
the
pa
announcer
says
it
but
youre
creating
a
scoring
opportunity
where
there
might
not
have
been
one
before
i
can
see
the
relationship
between
free
throws
awarded
after
a
certain
number
of
fouls
but
its
obviously
easier
to
score
in
basketball
there
are
more
opportunities
if
a
basketball
team
scores
points
thats
at
least
fifty
chances
made
the
average
number
of
shots
taken
by
each
team
in
a
hockey
game
and
this
is
a
total
guess
is
probably
around
and
a
team
is
lucky
to
capitalize
on
maybe
of
them
you
have
some
good
ideas
concerning
the
other
penalties
but
i
think
that
a
player
should
be
awarded
a
penalty
shot
only
when
they
had
a
chance
to
score
and
was
interfered
with
also
later
in
the
post
you
talked
about
how
boring
the
nba
game
you
attended
was
that
play
was
stopped
too
often
wouldnt
your

shot
rule
take
up
more
time
during

i
place

geoff

he
had
goals
and
points
last
season
as
a
center
then
moved
to

wing

has
so
far
put
up
goals

quartet
of

poulin
nylander
and
petrovicky
have
been
attracting
the
most
attention
but
cassels
is
just
and
will
score
close
to
points
this
season
he
has
quite
nicely
assumed
the
role
of
number
one
center
on
the
team
and
works
very
well
with
sanderson
yake
bounced
around
the
minors
for
a
number
of
seasons
but
is
still
and
will
put
up
about
goals
and
points
this
season
yake
like
sanderson
started
performing
better
offensively
once
he
was
converted
from
center
to
wing
although
lefty
sanderson
went
to
the
left

went

i
am
sick
of
watching
a

between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red

and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north

isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on

is
getting
worse
as
well
gee
youd
think
winnipeg
would
be
tops
on
that
list
what
with
regulars
being
european
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
well
being
a
jet
fan
i
sometimes
wish
that
bure
would
get
knocked
silly
too
nothing
serious
just
enough
to
keep
him
out
of
a
game
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
in
most
cases
the
owners
have
very
little
to
do
with
it
they
give
their
general
managers
one
order
when
it
comes
to
the
draftfind
me
the
best
players
so
that
our
team
will
win
the
stanley
cup
whether
that
player
is
in
kindersley
saskatchewan
or
chelyabinsk
russia
if
the
gm
believes
him
to
be
the
better
player
the
gm
should
be
drafting
him
where
do
you
get
off
calling
the
nhl
their
league
when
referring
to
canadian
players
it
doesnt
belong
to
them
it
belongs
to
the
owners
the
owners
can
do
what
they
want
while
a
canadian
content
rule
might
be
enforcable
here
in
canada
there
is
enough
doubt
that
it
would
be
enforcable
in
the
us
that
the
cfl
sorry
for
the
football
reference
didnt
even
try
to
push
their

rule
on

goldminers
increasing
the
competition
for
the
elite
positions
in
most
cases
would
make
players
better
anyways
oh
yeah
and
how
many
europeans
play
at
the
lower
levels
of
professional
hockey
in
north
america
while
there
are
some
that
play
in
the
ahl
or
the
ihl
where
thats
an
nhl

primary

you
dont

teams
in

the
jets
do
have
a
few
russian
players
in
moncton
but
i
dont

there
are
any

in

so
with
all
those

there
are
plenty
of
positions
for

i

i

c
lemieux
said
he
would
refuse
to
go
to
edmonton
earlier
this
year
i
know
there
are
many
noncultural
reasons
behind
these
but
there
is
more
some
american
players
who
played
for
the
expos
complained
about
the
french
fact
and
that
the
city
was
not
quite
like
the
other
us
cities
one
players
wife
trying
to
make
her
point
went
on
to
complain
that
she
could
not
even
find
her
favorite
brand
of
nacho
chips
in
montreal
anybody
knows
what
happened
when
all
these
us
football
players
moved
to
london
spain
etc
for
the
one
year
of
that
new
football
league
years
ago
i
wonder
what
the
players
association
thinks
about
going
to
europe
myself
i
would
like
to
see
some
european
teams
but
what
would
be
the
best
way
to
do
it
marc

sad
day
for
hockey
ethan
z
evans
writes
of
course
penalties
will
have
to
be
changed
roughing
chauvanistic
males
being
aggressive
slashing
chauvanistic
males
venting
frustration
fighting
proof
that
males
cannot
cope
with
their
feelings
no
no
no
since
all
the
penalties
fall
into
three
classes
there
should
only
be
three
penalties
foul
any
illegal
contact
with
the
other
player
or
his
stick
with
your
body
or
stick
if
you
get
you
are
out
for
the
game
unsportsmanlike
contact
an
intentional
foul
this
inlcludes
all
the
current
flavours
of
roughing
fighting
and
boarding
if
you
get
two
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
and
fined
technical
foul
bad
mouthing
the
ref
by
player
or
coach
penalty
shot
is
awarded
two
and
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
besides
the
penalty
shot
for
one
technical
if
the
team
gets
penalties
in
a
period
the
opposing
team
gets
a
penalty
shot
for
every
additional
one
until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
gets
two
shots
if
heshe
was
in
the
act
of
shooting
when
the
foul
ocured
this
works
well
for
several
reasons
first
penalty
shots
are
the
most
exciting
thing
in
hockey
right
so
it
follows
that
the
more
the
better
next
when
the
player
is
setting
up
for
a
penalty
shot
the
network
can
take
a
commercial
finally
with
only
three
penalties
the
network
announcers
don
meredith
dick
vitale
john
madden
pat
summerall
and
marv
levy
among
others
will
be
able
to
tell
the
viewers
what
happened
before
the
pa
announcer
says
it
oh
one
other
rule
when
a
goal
is
scored
times
a
period
the
play
cannot
resume
until
the
pa
announcer
announces
it
this
way
the
network
can
sneak
in
a
few
more
commercials
then
once
the
pa
announcer
has
told
them
who
scored
the
tv
announcer
can
tell
you
the
viewer
and
even
have
a
chance
of
pronouncing
his
name
right
seriously
though
i
actually
went
to
see
a
nba
basketball
game
last
week
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
amazed
how
boring
it
was
the
play
is
so
slow
they
actually
had
fans
come
out
for
things
like
freethrow
shooting
contests
during
the
period
of
course
the
laker
girls
get
to
do
their
routines
at
least
times
during
the
game
and
not
just
between
periods
either
there
is
a
whistle
every
seconds
on
average
maybe
less
the
game
is
minutes
with
minutes
between
quarters
and
and
a
minute
halftime
and
it
still
takes
over
hours
the
reason
for
this
has
to
be
tv
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
throw
in
commercials
and
have
the
announcer
jabber
while
nothing
else
is
happening
on
tv
basketball
is
fairly
entertaining
imho
but
it
is
better
to
watch
it
on
tv
than
to
be
there
if
this
is
the
road
the
nhl
is
following
then
it
truly
is
a
sad
day
enough
for
now

barasso
the
cheap
shot
master
after
watching
the
pengiuns
all
year
and
as
many
other
teams
as
possible
ive
really
noticed
an
increase
in
tom
barassos
cheap
shots
this
year
and
not
noticed
a
corrsponding
increase
with
other
goaltenders
ive
also
noticed
that
he
usually
gets
away
with
it
just
as
examples
last
night
i
noticed
him
elbowing
scott
stevens
in
the
head
which
basically
started
the
whole
shoving
match
that
got
stevens
scott
and
tocchet
minute
minors
he
also
kicked
john
mclean
of
course
he
wasnt
called
for
that
isnt
kicking
an
automatic
match
penalty
and
game
suspension
i
think
glenn
anderson
got
one
a
few
years
ago
for
kicking
gaetan
duchesne
in
the
chest
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
barasso
is
the
dirtiest
golatender
since
hextall
hes
also
very
good
how
about
that
tocchet
headbutt
is
there
an
automatic
susppension
that
goes
along
with
a
nonkicking
match
penalty
i
cant
remember
anymore
oh
the
playoffs
should
be

ralph

re
how
to

pittsburgh
from

matyas
now
if
we
could
just
clone
chelioss
personality
and
transplant
it
into
all
of
the
defensemen
on
the
islanders
capitals
and
devils
gerald
in
other
words
you
want
to
turn
them
all
into
assholes
so
they
will
spend
lots
of
time
in
the
penalty
box
and
get
lots
of
misconducts
and
this
comes
from
a
chelios
fan
yeah
and
also
be
second
in
the
team
in
scoring
and
play
about
minutes
a
game
and
play
on
the
power
play
and
kill
penalties
and
be
the
best
defenseman
in
the
league
id
take
a
whole
team
of
chelioses
if
i
could
that
way
when
one
got
a
penalty
the
others
could
kill
it

matt
brown
writes
more
about
the
messiersamuelsson
incident
while
this
is
true
strictly
speaking
it
was
the
rocksteady
replicant
who
initially
used
his
stick
illegally
to
measure
messiers
ribcage
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
from
seeing
the
replay
in
slomo
that
was
coming
at
messier
with
intenttohasta
la
vista
in
mind
and
should
have
been
gone
for
that
i
agree
with
rick
that
ulfs
cross
check
wasnt
illegal
it
was
the
kind
of
check
you
see
a
dozen
times
during
a
game
without
being
called
slomos
sometimes
have
a
tendency
to
make
things
look
worse
than
they
really
are
besides
if
messier
cant
take
the
heat
he
should
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
so
staffan
how
is
mattias
timmander
doing
this
year
and
any
impression
on
markus
czeriew
lost
my
roster
list
on
hammerby
does
it
look
like
they
will
make
it
to
the
eliteserien
for
next
year
and
then
get
stomped
if
markus
goes
to
boston
well
matt
mattias
timmander
hasnt
been
playing
with
the
modo
elite
league
team
yet
just
the
modo
junior
team
so
i
predict
he
needs
a
few
more
years
here
before
he
can
join
the
bs
i
saw
him
play
in
the
swedish
championship
game
for
junior
players
this
year
and
he
played
very
well
a
physical
game
but
not
the
kind
of
rough
stuff
that
ulfie
does
i
suspect
you
would
like
to
have
a
ulf
typeofplayer
on
the
bs
team
too
as
for
mariusz
czerkawski
he
has
had
a
great
season
for
hammarby
in
division
he
scored
if
i
remember
correctly
points
this
season
and
then
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
point
season
in
sweden
is
considered
very
good
due
to
the
limited
number
of
games
mariusz
is
djurgarden
property
he
was
just
on
loan
to
hammarby
so
he
will
play
in
elitserien
next
season
unless
the
bs
can
get
him
of
course
i
would
say
that
mariusz
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
player
to
watch
in
swedish
hockey
this
season

isles
hockey
ramblings
well
the
patrick
division
got
a
little
more
interesting
last
night
the
islanders
lost
in
ot
and
the
devils
tied
the
pens
that
means
if
the
isles
beat
the
devils
on
friday
the
will
meet
the
caps
in
the
playoffs
however
i
have
some
more
comments
on
the
islanders
and
hockey
in
general
that
i
need
to
get
off
my
chest
first
of
all
with
the
islanders
backtoback
lackluster
performances
against
the
whalers
one
may
think
that
the
islanders
are
out
of
shape
these
guys
always
suck
wind
in
the
period
come
on
a
little
in
the
and
run
out
of
gas
too
soon
it
is
unbelieveable
how
many
one
goal
games
these
guys
have
lost
anyway
the
games
was
pretty
wide
open
the
isles
still
have
tons
of
trouble
scoring
the
whalers
played
a
golie
in
is
nhl
start
i
think
his
name
was
lenarduzzi
sp
his
nhl
debut
was
the
tuesday
tie
against
the
isles
like
i
mentioned
before
this
guy
looked
like
the
best
golie
on
the
planet
for
a
while
until
he
misplayed
a
mahlakov
slap
shot
to
go
to
ot
i
say
its
because
the
isles
dont
shoot
correctly
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
also
i
think
it
is
really
a
shame
for
hockey
when
i
guy
like
mick
vukota
gets
as
much
ice
time
as
he
does
this
guy
has
about
as
much
hockey
talent
as
jiggs
macdonald
who
did
play
hockey
i
think
anytime
he
gets
the
puck
it
gets
stolen
and
he
always
starts
fights
and
gets
needless
penalties
richard
pilon
is
another
guy
who
is
on
the
ice
to
stir
up
crap
and
hes
a
defenseman
hes
got
to
be
approaching
negative
infinity
for
his
plusminus
this
guy
gets
beaten
all
the
time
why
the
need
for
such
enforcers
not
only
do
fights
slow
the
game
down
alot
but
it
takes
away
from
the
guys
who
are
really
trying
to
play
the
game
ill
be
one
of
the
few
to
admit
i
do
enjoy
a
good
fight
once
in
a
while
but
only
when
its
called
for
you
know
when
a
guy
checks
the
goalie
too
hard
in
other
words
a
violation
of
hockey
ethics
might
cause
you
to
get
puched
but
there
is
no
need
to
start
crap
when
you
are
losing
or
becuase
you
can
get
away
with
it
does
anyone
agree
that
referees
need
to
be
a
little
less
lenient
in
the
and
ot
i
mean
come
on
already
im
sick
of
seeing
teams
pulling
guys
down
holding
guys
etc
just
becuase
the
referee
doesnt
call
it
ot
and
late
in
the
should
be
a
time
for
strategy
not
physical
prowess
trying
to
set
up
a
goal
should
be
first
and
foremost
if
you
are
so
afraid
that
the
other
team
is
going
to
score
that
you
have
to
pull
a
guy
down
to
prevent
it
you
dont
deserve
to
win

that

you

this

the

nhl

wont

no

a

the

totally
useless
because
they
lack
a
forward
who
stands

neely
shanahan
tocchet
etc
etc
too
bad
demers
wont
put
dipietro
or
leclair
on

powerplay
more
often
dammit
even
ewen
would
at

cause
some
disruptions
montreal
desperately
needs
a
power
forward
with
some
talent
imo
then
watch
them
in
their
own
zone
patrick
roy
is
screened
on
everything
say
what
you
want
about
his
performance
imnsho
he
cannot
stop
what
he
cannot
see
and
montreals
defence
does
a
miserable
job
of
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
last
night
against
washington
roy
played
a
great
game
the
first
goal
came
on
the
most
ridiculous
goalmouth
scramble
ive
seen
in
a
long
time
and
he
didnt
have
a
hope
in
hell
of
stopping
the
shot
the
second
goal
came
on
a
deflection
of
a
shot
he
only
partially
saw
anyway
pathetic
defence
the
third
goal
was

he

boston
vs
buffalo
the
bruins
are
playing
some
excellent
hockey
and
with
cam
neely
back
and
moog
his
old
self
again
this
should
be
a
cakewalk
bruins
in
im
hoping
for
a
fuhr
miracle
but
i
agree
that
boston
will
likely
win
the
series
goaltending
is
about
equal
top
offensive
players
are
about
equal
mogilnylafontaine
vs
oatesjuneau
but
buffalo
has
no
answer
to
neely
not
to
imply
that
neely
is
not
a
top
offensive
player
btw
in
fact
hes
one
of
my
favourites
even
though
hes
a
damn
bruin
and
the
rest
of
the
matchup
wrt
lineup
favours
boston
anyway
but
i
think
it
will
go
six
quebec
vs
montreal
this
one
is
very
tough
to
call
montreal
certainly
has
the
experience
factor
but
quebec
is
more
talented
imho
itll
come
down
to
the
goalies
ill
go
with
experience
and
roy
canadiens
in
agreed
herebut
montreal
will
be
pushed
to
the
limit
is
it
just
me
or
does
everything
montreal
does
in
the
playoffs
come
down
to
roy
go
habs
final
boston
vs
montreal
will
bruin
domination
continue
in
this
rivalry
yes
moog
has
consistently
outperformed
roy
in
the
playoffs
after
stuff
bruins
in
five
i
cant
predict
a
montreal
victory
because
ive
been
watching
them
play
for
weeks
and
imo
they
severly
need
some
tougher
players
especially
to
play
in
the
garden
last
time
they
beat
the
bs
but
boston
had
a
clear
territorial
advantage
the
victory
was
roys
at
the
same
time
i
cant
bring
myself
to
predict
the
possibility
of
a
loss
so
ill
just
say
i
will
not
be
putting
money
on
this
series
patrick
division
semifinal
pittsburgh
vs
ny
islanders
what
can
i
say
the
pens
are
flying
high
and
have
the
most
talent
in
the
league
agreed
ny
doesnt
have
the
goaltending
to
stop
the
onslaught
independent
of
the
trouble
they
have
given
pittsburgh
this
year
pens
in
five
which
is
credit
to
ny
washington
vs
new
jersey
capitals
in
agreed
here
too
but
i
think
it
will
go
at
least
six
jersey
has
a
decent
team
and
washington
has
done
poorly
against
the
division
this
year
pittsburgh
vs
washington
if
the
caps
had
bill
ranford
i
might
see
an
upset
but
don
beaupre
just
doesnt
inspire
my
hopes
penguins
in
i
think
they
will
use
tabaracci
more
after
beaupre
gets
shelled
i
dont
think
it
will
go
six
eithermaybe
five
conference
final
pittsburgh
vs
boston
a
replay
of
last
year
the
penguins
are
just
as
good
as
months
ago
and
the
bruins
are
much
improved
but
penguins
in
if
pittsburgh
plays
boston
imo
they
win
in
likely
five
possibly
six
they
own
the
bruins
if
they
play
montreal
i
think
it
will
go
to
seven
and
once
again
i
wont
be
putting
money
on
the
seventh
game
i
say
seven
because
the
habs
have
played
pittsburgh
very
tough
this
season
campbell
conference
norris
division
semifinal
chicago
vs
st
louis
or
minnesota
blackhawks
in
chicago
will
win
but
i
think
in
at
least
six
chicago
is
not
that
good
imo
and
remember
that
they
take
ridiculous
numbers
of
penalties
detroit
vs
toronto
the
leafs
have
had
an
excellent
season
but
theyve
been
playing
playoff
hockey
all
year
the
habs
under
burns
were
the
same
way
and
always
wilted
in
the
playoffs
red
wings
in
very
true
the
leafs
have
much
to
be
proud
of
but
they
will
soon
find
out
why
montreal
did
so
lousy
in
the
playoffs
toronto
might
win
two
or
three
at
mlg
though
wings
in
six
maybe
even
seven
final
chicago
vs
detroit
this
will
be

fedorov
will

red
wings
in
it
will
be
a
warpossibly
the
most
intense
playoff
series
of
them
all
and
yes
i

detroit
will
win
probert

to
come
up

may
explain

they
get
hammered
by
a
team
chasing
them
calgarywinnipeg
in
six
calgary
vs
los
angeles
this
would
have
been
tough
to
call
except
for
three
things
the
kings
dont
have
a
goalie
gary
roberts
will
be
back
the

shot
themselves
in

foot
by
trading
a

winner
paul
coffey
for
a
proven
loser
jimmy
carson
gretzky
is
just
too
weary
to
carry
this
group
flames
in
this
is
also
tough
for
me
to
call
because
i
havent
seen
the
smythe
enough
i
dont
think
roberts
will
be
well
enough
to
figure
in
coffey
is
a
nonissue
who
cares
what
carson
has
done
before
and
never
underestimate
gretzky
la
in
six
final
vancouver
vs
calgary
flames
in
if
it
is
these
two
calgary
will
not
need
six

i

in
six
stanley
cup
final
pittsburgh
vs
detroit
three
in

and

for
the
pens
or
can
the
wings
complete
a
dream
season
well
the
wings
are
better
in
goal
not
sufficiently
so
though
imho
and
have
better
dmen
however
mario
and
the
boys
can
sure
score
look
for
jagr
to
shine
in
the
playoffs
though
i
sure
would
love
to
see
probert
beat
some
sense
into
him
the
pens
are
just
too
much
especially
since
detroit
will
have
a
tougher
battle
to
get
here
penguins
in
if
pittsburgh
plays
detroit
it
will
go
longer
than
five
and
i
wouldnt
bet
against
the
wings
they
are
very
strong
imo
and
nobody
knows
how
strong
because
theyve
been
underachieving
most
of
the
year
if
forced
to
choose
though
id
have
to
take
the
penguins
a
side
note
vlad
last
week
you
said
that
selanne
was
a
better
player
than
gilmour
no
way
he
is
a
more
talented
pure
goal
scorerbut
aside
from
the
age
difference
there
is
no
way
i
would
take
him
over
gilmour
on
my
team
im
not
asking
for
flames
either
btwive
spent
more
than
enough
time
arguing
on
behalf
of
selanne
and
i
still
say
hes
a
great
player
but
while
he
and
gilmour
are
both
dangerous
offensively
give
teemu
an
edge
gilmour
does
it
all
i
know
a
lot
of

goes
on

from

fans
but
imo
you
guys
are
letting
your
dislike
of
gilmour
cloud
your
judgement
when
it
comes
to
his
skill
he
is

whats

bad
about
the
new

format
do
you
really
believe
teams
that
finish
fourth
in
their
div
deserve
to
be
in
the
playoffs
with
the
new
format
you
have
more

more

do
you
really
want
to
see
the

sabres
umpteen
times
or
would
you
rather
see
the
bruins
and
the
capitals
in
the
secound
round
of
playoffs
there
is
really
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
but
they
tried
it
just
a
little
over
a
decade
ago
and
noone
showed
up
for
the
early
rounds
in
the
playoffswhereas
soon
after
they
went
to
the
divisional
setup
arenas
were
mostly
filled
in
the
early
rounds
the
empirical
evidence
of
the
last
two
decades
is
that
more
people
will
show
up
to
see
the
bruins
play
the
sabre
umpteen
times
than
see
the
bruins
play
the
captials
in
the
first
round
maybe
hockey
has
increased
in
popularity
sufficiently
that
this
will
no
longer
be
the
case

experiment
is
worthwhile

the

winning

that
pens
streak
is
a
playoff
streak
tied
by
the
chicago
blackhawks
who
had
won
in

until
they
met
the
pens
in
the
finals
last
year
the
game
unbeaten
so
far
is
a
regular
season
unbeaten
streak
but
hey
dont
take
it
personally
im
a
flyers
fan
and
two
in

is
a
stretch
but
with
a

theyll
be
there
next

by
the
way
since
the

need

what

boston

the

well
now
that
the

the

for

let
toronto

detroit
beat
the

chicago

champ
they
will
have

but
that

so
the
advantage
goes
to
the

again
then
bring

what

you

id
like
to
understand
your
reasoning
from
my
seat
the
caps
dont
really
appear
to
believe
that
they
can
defeat
pittsburgh
therefore
they
dont
i
think
their
spirit
was
broken
in
last
years
playoffs
and
hasnt
really
recovered
i
dont
know
what
the
season
series
numbers
were
but
i
believe
that
the

won
it
i
think
that
either
the
devils
or
the
islanders
will
cause
more
problems
for
what
is
this
spirit
crap
im
a
caps
fan
and
hope
they
win
if
they
end
up
facing
pittsburgh
but
i
dont
think
the
caps
lose
to
pitt
because
of
lack
of
spirit
yes
the
penguins
won
the
season
series
against
the
caps
theyve
won
eighteen
games
in
a
row
for
gods
sake
did
you
ever
think
the
penguins
might
be
good
and
thats
why
they
win
i
reread
what
i
wrote
and
it
didnt
say
exactly
what
i
thought
sure
the
pens
are
a
better
team
theyve
got
size
and
the
best
skill
players
in
the
league
theyve
also
got
the
best
clutch
goaltending
theyre
the
best
team
in
the
league
but
my
point
was
the
caps
have
not
played
to
their
ability
level
vs
the
pens
since
last
years
choke
and
thats
the
mental
problem
the
one
theyve
had
for
a
number
of
years
i
tried
to
point
out
spirit
mental
preparedness
will
to
win
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
missing

you

now
the
major
differences
between
playoff
hockey
and
normal
hockey
is
play
ing
every
other
night
which
is
physically
exhausting
and
you
play
the
same
team
in
a
consecutive
string
of
games
is
this
what
you

by

have
you
even
thought
about
what
you
mean
by
pressure
or
are
your
thoughts
like
most
of
the
rest
of
this
drivel
simply
halfbaked
this
was
for
anybody
who
would
like
to
check
he
went
on
in
another
article
to
say
paraphrased
playoff
hockey
is
just
an
expression
used
by
announcers
to
convince
simpleminded
folks
like
yourself
that
what
you
are
seeing
is
a
better
product
than
a
regularseason
game
now
however
in

roger

writes
with
a
win
over
a
tough

the

showed
all
doubters
what
playoff
hockey
is
all
about
so
roger
what
exactly
is
playoff
hockey
all
about
or
is
it
a
convenient
phrase
to
use
in
certain
circumstances
only
you
see
when
you
spout
off
with
flame
bait
too
many
times
sooner
or
later
it
catches
up
with
you
nice
try
deepak
but
tough
whaler
squad
should
have
clued
you
in
to
the
fact
that
my
leaf
woofing
was
tongueincheek
if
playoff
hockey
is
any
more
intense
than
the
regular
season
variety
then
it
is
because
the
teams
are
facing
each
other
at
least
consecutive
times
in
days
and
hockey
being
the
contact
sport
that
it
is
some
things
will
be
carried
over
that
might
dissipate
during
the
regular
season
but
that
is
only
for
some
of
the
players
many
of
the
rest
who
have
been
playing
with
injuries
who
miss
their
families
or
who
like
grant
fuhr
would
really
rather
be
playing
golf
dont
really
give
a
damn
of
course
i
cant
say
this
for
sure
but
i
believe
that
this
is
fairly
typical
of
human
nature
and
i
dont
think
that
hockey
players
are
above
having
what
i
consider
typically
human
attitudes
with
the
recent
salary
escalations
the
key
players
are
actually
losing
money
by
participating
in
the
playoffs
the
ones
who
regard
the
playoff
take
as
some
kind
of
a
bonanza
are
fringe
players
who
are
unlikely
to
consistently
be
a
force
in
the
playoffs
now
i
know
some
of
you
are
going
to
come
back
with
winning
spirit
and
all
of
that
crap
but
these
players
are
professionals
after
all
while
they
may
love
to
play
the
game
that
love
is
entirely
incidental
to
their
purpose
which
is
to
make
a
decent
living
of
course
the
coach
is
a
professional
as
well
and
part
of
what
he
is
being
paid
to
do
is
motivate
the
players
so
if
the
coach
does
his
job
well
enough
the
players
may
respond
with
a
winning
effort
the
second
season
is
after
all
merely
an
exhibition
the
true
champions
of
the
league
are
the
division
winners
the
teams
that
come
out
on
top
after
the
long
struggle
of
the
season
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
merely
accord
victory
to
the
team
that
has
remained
healthy
and
hot
the
emphasis
on
the
playoffs
with
their
sudden
death
appeal
has
been
promoted
by
the
media
and
the
owners
with
profit
purely
in
mind
even
if
pittsburgh
loses
the
playoffs
we
all
know
that
they
were
really
the
best
team
in
the

over
the

boston
out

will

no

they
have

the

have

many
ways
to
win
if
boston
does
indeed
win
the

nothing
is
certain
and
indeed
gets
to
play
the

then
i
think
youll
find
a
very
different
boston
team
this
year
boston
will
use
every
trick
in
the
book
to
shut
down
the
pens
offense
something
they
didnt
even
try
last
year
the
pens
weak
spot
is
defense
and
goaltending
if
boston
first
i
enjoyed
reading
your
post
second
i
disagree
with
the
pens
weak
spot
being
defense
and
goaltending
for
a
couple
of
reasons
barrasso
has
had
a
spectacular
year
no
slow
start
consistently
sharp
gaa
and
leads
the
league
in
wins
tommy
deserves
the
vezina
given
the
lack
of
respect
he
commands
though
i
doubt
he
will
win
it
the
other
reason
concerns
the
pens
team
defense
they
are
hovering
around
or
in
the
fewest
goals
allowed
that
is
a
big
improvement
for
them
and
it
indicates
that
they
are
playing
better
team
defense
can
shut
down
the
pens
offense
and
get
an
early
goal
then
you
have
a
real
game
if
the
pens
score
first
then
its
practically
over
i
dont
think
the
pens
have
the
discipline
to
stick
to
the
team
game
if
theyre
held
scoreless
minutes
into
the
second
boston
doesnt
have
the
guns
of
the
pens
but
the
pens
doesnt
have
the
defense
goaltending
and
discipline
of
boston
still
boston
can
put
the
puck
in
the
net
remember
that
boston
is
not
a
runandgun
patrickstyle
team
although
they
played
runandgun
hockey
for
the
better
part
of
the
regular
season
who
doesnt
even
neely
backchecks
all
the
way
in
behind
his
own
net
if
necessary
penaltykilling
will
be
a
big
factor
boston
are
i
believe
over
the
last
shorthanded
situations
meaning
they
have
scored
shg
while
giving
up
ppg
one
in
a
lackluster
game
against
ottawa
id
say
the
series
will
go
to
or
but
im
much
less
certain
whether
it
will
be
in
favor
of
the
pens
or
the
bs
their
styles
going
into
the
playoffs
are
too
different
to
make
it
predictable
still
id
place
my
bets
on
the
pens
i
think
my
prediction
is
that
if
the
bs
can
get
the
first
goal
in
four
of
the
games
theyll
take
the
series
otherwise
the
pens
will
but
id
rather
wait
and
see
whether
the
bs
will
actually
get
out
of
the

to
begin

this
is
the

who
forgoes
points
to

his
team
out
defensively
it
is
an
unsung
hero
of
sorts
yes
lemieux
and
gilmour
are
good
defensive
players
but
they
play
a
more
offensively
oriented
style
than
a
true
defensive
forward
this
year
you
mean
guys
that
check
but
cant
score
the
guys
who
can
both
check
and
score
shouldnt
be
candidates
is
that
right
the
selke
candidate
forwards
main
purpose
on
a
shift
is
to
prevent
goals
from
being
scored
not
to
score
them
when
lemieux
or
gilmour
play
their
number
one
purpose
is
to
score
defence
is
secondary
especially
considering
the
line
that
plays
against
them
is
probably
a
defensive
one
that
is
why
they
are
not
selke
candidates
when
tarasov
called
bob
gainey
the
best
player
in
the
world
it
was
assumed
that
he
meaned
the
best
technical
player
the
one
who
knew
every
intricacy
about
playing
hockey
and
never
made
a
technical
error
and
who
was
it
that
made
this
assumption
all
of
your
friends
maybe
sorry
greg
but
people
arent
enoughyou
can
assume
all
that
you
want
to
but
if
you
think
tarasov
was
serious
then
you
are
an
idiot
someone
posted
something
about
this
assumption
being
lost
in
translation
it
was
a
few
months
ago
whoever
this
was
please
repost
it
i
agree
with
this
assessment
bob
gainey
may
have
been
the
best
technical
player
ever
right
greg
did
you
see
this
in
the
sun
or
something
what
did
you
think
of
claude
provost
gainey
was
nothing
more
than
a
journeyman
player
whos
outstanding
abilities
were
entirely
political
he
might
have
had
a
col
lection
of
defensive
skills
but
he
had
absolutely
no
offensive
skills
at
all
none
but
perhaps
you
think
that
the
abilities
to
pass
the
puck
shoot
the
puck
and
deke
a
goalie
or
defenseman
are
not
technical
skills
gainey
is
the
best
defensive
forward
ever
i
stand
by
that
assessment
he
was
a
very
good
player
who
belongs
in
the
hall
of
fame
did
you
ever
watch
him
play
he
never
made

when
he

with
st

i
would
have
expected
you
to
have
picked

gilmour
was

he
was
not

when

you

ill
repost
the

averages
you
dont
need
to
go
through
the
complicated
team
adjustment
you
are
using
all
you
need
is
the
team
average
by
summing
all
the
individual
players
and
divide
by
the
total
number
of
players
on
the
team
this
will
be
a
little
distorted
because
the
players
who
have
been
traded
recently
will
have
come
with
scores
based
on
their
original
teams
this
shouldnt
distort
it
too
bad
though
if
you
want
to
look
at
individual
players
from
this
perspective
then
go
ahead
youll
require
the
original
player
stats
though
question
if
a
team
uses
players
in
a
season
do
you
merely
divide
the
total
by
if
so
a
player
who
plays
in
only
game
is
considered
equally
valuable
as
a
player
who
plays
in
all
of
them
another
way
of
looking
at
the
same
thing
is
to
compare
the
deviation
from
the
mean
for
the
team
of
the
player
to
the
standard
deviation
for
the
team
ill
post
both
since
the
standard
deviation
for
each
team
is
different
i
am
unsure
how
transferable
between
teams
that
these
stats
are
shouldnt
the
average
standard

used
i
am

method

the

main
purpose
on
a
shift
is
to
prevent
goals
from
being
scored
not
to
score
them
when
lemieux
or
gilmour
play
their
number
one
purpose
is
to
score
defence
is
secondary
especially
considering
the
line
that
plays
against
them
is
probably
a
defensive
one
that
is
why
they
are
not
selke
candidates
gainey
is
the

forward
ever
i
stand
by
that
assessment
he
was
a
very
good
player
who
belongs
in

did
you
ever
watch

he
never

i

well
suffice

that
it

for

heres
something
do
you
think
that
the

hockey
could
contribute
to
a
rise

i
would

this

i

that

the

had

gainey
could

the

play

since
hartford
is
pitiful
the
islanders
played
pitiful
since
pittsburgh
is
great
the

will
most
likely
play
great
this
is
most

due

inexperience
and
very
poor

it

meaningless

statistic
with
another
players
out
of
the
context
of
the
role
and
the
playing

of
the
players
involved
its
just
as
meaningless
to
compare
goals
assists
pim
and
any
other
stat
i
can
think
of
each
player
is
asked
to
take
a
unique
role
for

the

will
never
be
the

from
one
player

another
playing
on
the

different

yet
awards
are

received
based

on
these
meaningless

the
operative

are
in

stats
must
be
interpreted
tempered
with
other
information
one
has
about
the
player
to
compare
jagrs

plusminus
is
ridiculous
and
absurd
and
comparing
jagrs

is
just
as
ridiculous

not
more
ridiculous
and
absurd
as
comparing

for
selanne

how

misplayed

at

blue

and
nylander
stripped
him
and
took
off
the
recchi
goal
was
a
on
with
lindros
the
bowen
goal
was
just
a
puck
he
threw
at
the
net
got
a
good
carom
and
it
ended
up
behind
the
goalie
on
the
second
nylander
goal
he
got
three
whacks
at
the
puck
before
it
went
in
this
is
the
most
frustrating
part
of
the
flyers
defense
take
the
body
and
if
they
get
one
shot
and
beat
you
fine
dont
give
them
another
chance
carkner
galley
and
mcgill
are
all
terrible
about
this
ill
bet
money
at
least
one
of
them
was
the
closest
flyer
to
the
play
thats
all
i
have
my
radio
got
bad
after
that
and
i
was
lucky
to
know
who
it
was
that
scored
much
less
how
from
what
i
heard
roussel
had
a
very
strong
game
after
the
game
gene
hart
asked
bobby
taylor
to
pick
the
three
stars
of
the
season
rather
than
of
the
game
it
was
garry
galley
for
his
career
high
point
total
im
surprised
that
a
former
goalie
wouldnt
look
closer
at
his
defensive
play
tommy
soderstrom
for
his
team
record
tying
shutouts
in
only
about
a
season
and
mark
recchi
for
his
all
time
high
team
single
season
scoring
mark
but
heres
the
odd
part
he
couldnt
decide
between
lindros
and
recchi
for
number
if
he
picks
recchi
as
after
he
had
a
hard
time
choosing
between
him
and
lindros
doesnt
that
make
lindros
what
you
wanna
know
my
three
stars
of
the
season
well
since
you
asked
eric
lindros
eric
dominates
a
game
simply
by
stepping
out
onto
the
ice
the
difference
between
the
teams
record
with
him
and
without
him
is
no
accident
i
believe
that
the
team
could
have
been
almost
as
successful
without
recchi
there
is
no
question
that
this
team
is
significantly
better
with
eric
lindros
on
it
and
i
think
that
he
will
deservedly
wear
the
c
on
his
jersey
next
season
tommy
soderstrom
shutouts
was
second
in
the
league
to
only
ed
belfour
and
tommy
didnt
have
a
chris
chelios
booo
in
front
of
him
he
also
didnt
play
a
complete
season
due
to
heart
problems
sentimental
edge
here
my
family
has
a
history
of
heart
problems
theres
no
question
in
my
mind
that
tommy
soderstrom
is
this
teams
goalie
of
the
future
and
if
roussel
complains
again
about
being
number
look
for
him
to
be
traded
within
years
mark
recchi
again
you
cant
argue
with
an
alltime
team
high
single
season
scoring
mark
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
teams
that
didnt
have
a
single
player
get
as
many
points
plus
mark
is
the
only
flyer
to
play
the
entire
season
not
a
tough
choice
honorable
mentions
rod
brindamour
topped
his
single
season
high
point
total
which
he
set
last
year
the
difference
was
that
he
wasnt
on
the
top
line
this
year
and
didnt
get
as
much
playing
time
then
again
he
didnt
get
the
defensive
attention
that
he
got
last
year
from
the
other
team
either
dimtri
yushkevich
was
the
teams
most
consistent
defenseman
yes
he
made
rookie
mistakes
but
he
was
usually
fast
enough
to
make
up
for
them
i
have
a
feeling
that
with
his
shot
hell
score
a
few
more
points
next
year
without
giving
up
anything
in
his
own
zone
and
i
suspect
that
hell
be
the
teams
top
defenseman
in
years
to
come
garry
galley
was
the
teams
point
leader
from
defensemen
again
there
are
some
things
you
just
cant
argue
with
and
he
battled
with
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
he
certainly
deserves
kudos
for
only
missing
one
game
and
that
was
against
his
wishes
under
doctors
orders
but
his
defensive
play
often
negates
his
offensive
contribution
a
little
more
caution
and
a
little
bit
smarter
in
his
own
end
will
make
him
a
much
more
important
part
of
the
team
next
year
brent
fedyk
was
the
leagues
biggest
improvement
over
last
years
point
total
but
consistency
became
a
problem
for
him

it
was

i
would
have
thought

saw
the

that
the
puck
didnt
go
in
the
referee
originally
signalled
no
goal
but
the
video
replay
judges
initiated
contact
with
the
referee
to
claim
that
a
goal
was
in
fact
scored
this
to
me
is
unheard
of
seeing
stuff
like
this
happen
gives

names
in
jwodziadliteuucp
john
wodziak
writes
sorry
roger
but
mr
basketbal
should
what
he
really
means
here
ie
he
should
have
said
that
he
hopes
fans
in
the
american
southeast
can
follow
the
names
of
the
divisions
the
odds
that
these
people
other
than
those
who
are
displaced
notherners
who
are
probably
already
fans
is
on
the
order
of
the
proverbial
snowballs
in
hell
i
am
not
at
all
clear
about
what
you
are
trying
to
say
here
if
you
asked
somone
who
had
never
heard
of
hockey
before
if
la
played
in
the
smythe
division
what
do
you
think
that
the
response
would
be
what
if
you
asked
this
person
if
la
played
in
the
west
division
the
naming
of
divisions
after
longdead
entrepreneurs
is
unnecessary
obfuscation
i
am
glad
that
the
names
are
being
changed
for
another
reason
the
names
patrick
smythe
norris
adams
and
campbell
are
all
the
names
of
socalled
builders
of
the
game
this
is
the
same
type
of
thinking
that
put
stein
in
the
hall
of
fame
this
is
absolute
nonsense
the
real
builders
of
the
game
are
richard
morenz
howe
conacher
orr
etc
if
you
are
going
to
name
the
divisions
after
people
at
least
name
the
divisions
after
people
who
deserve
it
yes
these
people
deserve
recognigtion
as
hockey
greats
but
the
old
division
names
took
into
account
messers
patrick
norris
smythe
and
the
prince
who
had
alot
more
to
do
with
the
origins
of
the
league
than
people
who
came
into
an
already
established
situation
it
is
much
easier
to
be
an
element
of
change
hardly
the
established
situation
existed
prior
to
smythe
et
al
the
stanley
cup
was
a
challenge
trophy
up
for
grabs
to
whatever
team
could
successfully
mount
the
challenge
what
our
dear
founders
did
was
formalize
the
challenge
they
created
a
closed
league
an
oligop
olistic
professional
system
in
the
interests
of
making
money
wheth
er
or
not
that
system
has
contributed
to
better
hockey
is
certainly
debatable
we
are
however
stuck
with
their
invention
and
that
de
bate
is
academic
the
point
to
be
made
however
is
that
people
played
hockey
and
people
enjoyed
watching
hockey
long
before
smythe
and
his
pals
showed
up
or
a
standout
in
an
existing
situation
than
it
is
to
be
someone
who
creates
a
new
situation
if
you
want
to
honor
players
like
bobby
orr
than
im
sure
you
can
find
a
reason
to
name
a
torphy
after
him
such
as
best
offensive
defenseman
whats
wrong
with
best
defenceman
period
was
there
ever
a
better
defenceman
was
there
ever
a
better
player
and
if
you
think
that
bruce
norris
contribution
was
somehow
more
significant
than
bobby
orrs
then
in
the
interests
of
education
why
dont
you
take
a
poll
and
find
out
how
many
people
know
who
norris
was
but
you
dont
have
to
do
you
no
i
cant
for
the
reasons
i
gave
above
im
in
the
same
boat
as
jason
and
i
grew
up
with
the
current
divisonal
names
and
learned
them
when
i
was
about
years
old
and
who
played
in
what
division
if
a
year
old
american
can
learn
this
why
would
it
be
hard
for
an
occasional
fan
to
pick
up
on
who
plays
in
what
division
so
you
dont
feel
that
you
should
have
to
make
the
effort
to
remember
that
vancouver
plays
in
the
west
division
or
pacific
or
whatever
other
intuitively
understandable
moniker
is
chosen
oh
now
i
see
your
point
your
intention
has
been
to
alert
us
to
the
erosion
of
purity
ill
bet
you
like
hockey
because
its
for
the
most
part
played
by
whites
of
european
extraction
probably
not
in
my
case
im
sure
of
this
what
you
said
would
be
like
me
saying
that
all
maple
leafs
fans
are
as
biased
closed
minded
ignorant
and
of
course
you
neatly
deleted
jasons
jingoistic
rant
about
the
game
losing
its
canadianization
quoting
me
out
of
context
does
more
to
erode
your
credibility
than
it
does
mine
my
position
is
clearly
progressive
and
is
anything
but
biased
closed
minded
ig
norant
arrogant
i
will
grant
you
arrogant
and
moronic
as
you
just
because
someone
a
doesnt
like
what
mr

a

the
minnesota
north

stars
whichever
you
prefer
lost
to
the
red
wings
by
a
score
of
the

goals
were
scored
by
mike
mcphee
and
ulf
dahlen
who
netted
two
including
the
final
one
in
franchise
history
with
less
than
a
minute
to
play
yes
its
a
shame
that
the
nhl
lost
a
fine
team
in
one
of
the
best
hockey
markets
in
the
country
being
a
north
stars
fan
it
is
sad
to
see
all
of
the
tradition
of
the
last
years
get
thrown
into
oblivion
at
the
hands
of
a
truly
crappy
owner
hopefully
the
nhl
will
install
an
expansion
franchise
in
the
twin
cities
within

here

playoffs
and
otherwise
at

civic
arena
scalping
is
illegal

nonetheless
present
outside
the
arena
best
strategy
given
that
you
dont
mind
missing
the
anthem
which
is
ok
if
be
taylor
decides
to
come
back
ever
again
is
to
wait
until
or
when
the
game
is
rolling
the
scalpers
are
at
this
point
desperate
to
sell
and
will
reduce
to
near

at

to
get

you

you
buy

you
could
usually

if

how

there
be

man
i

people

are

i
might
not
be
great
in

tell
me
how
can
two
teams
ahve
the

points
with
different

manretard
cant
believe
people
actually
put
win
as
first
in
a
tie
breaker
why
not
i
believe
both
the
devils
and
islanders
got
points
say
for
example
another
team
had
this
record
they
had
which
is
the
same
as
their

total
the
islanders
and
devils
records
are
both
it

the

and
will
give
the
broadway

in
pursuing
the
next
cup
chase
the
chicago
blackhawks
cut
their
last
tie
with
keenan
when
he
was
forced
out
as
general
manager
in
november
he
had
given
up
chicagos
coaching
duties
a
year
ago
and
his
thirst
for
the
power
of
a
gm
now
increases
the
pressure
on
beleaguered
rangers
gm
neil
smith
this
will
be
an
interesting
combination
to
watch
keenan
has
been
paid
enough
money
to
put
up
and
shut
up
and
just
be
a
coach
but
his
advice
on
any
player
moves
will
be
listened
to
closely
a
lot
of
big
player
moves
will
happen
remember
that
keenan
got
rid
of
denis
savard
the
country
club
days
are
over
when
keenan
left
chicago
i
couldnt
help
but
think
about
him
as
our
coach
smith
said
there
was
an
indication
he
would
be
taken
off
the
market
i
feared
that
and
couldnt
let
that
happen
if
paramount
had
given
smith
an
earlier
sign
of
support
and
offered
keenan
the
big
money
to
putupandshutup
back
in
january
the
rangers
might
not
be
heading
for
golf
now
keenan
takes
on
a
demoralized
team
that
offers
him
a
chance
to
fashion
yet
another
of
his
reclamation
projects
at
the
highest
salary
ever
commanded
by
an
nhl
coach
the
rangers
owned
by
gulf
western
have
bestowed
upon
keenan
an
unprecedented
million
fouryear
deal
ive
known
mike
a
long
time
messier
said
weve
won
two
canada
cups
together
hes
been
to
the
finals
three
times
maybe
we
miss
just
one
more
element
to
win
the
stanley
cup
i
dont
think
hes
the

person
he
was
years
ago
or
even
five
years
ago
i
think
he
has
changed
and
bettered
himself
with

one
of
keenans

statements
was

on

was
the

supposed

with

overriding

when

flipped

it
was

even
my

is
was
this
the

did
cbc
just
black
out

cbc

today
they

al

or
however
you
spell
the

name
must
be
from
chicago
because
on

he
said
its
not
even
closechicago
will
definatly
win
the
norris
division
in
the
playoffs
no
other
team
is
close
everyone
is
picking
chicago
i
dont
get
it
he
says
its
an
easy
choice
god
chicago
was
against
the
wings
and
they
won
the
division
by
a
point
or
two
followed
closely
by
toronto
who
is
also
a
good
team
as
for
the

beating
detroitdoubt
it
but
even
if
they
do
they
arent
going
to
get
by
chicago
if
even
more
amazingly
they
get
past
the
hawks
they
would
probably
face
vancouver
and
lose
as
for

reaching

the
best
story
i
remember
about

concerned
mel
bridgman
late
of

senators
while
he
was
in
philadelphia
bobby
clarke
arguably
one
of
the
great
captains
of

time
was
bumped
up
to
the
status
of
playing
coach
and
so
he
had
to
relinquish
the
captaincy
bridgman
be
came
the
new
captain
a
reporter
asked
a
flyer
what
bridgman
did
as
a
captain
since
clarke
was
still
the
undisputed
leader
amongst
the
players
the
reporter
was
told
that
bridgman
was
in
charge
of
making
sure
that
the

if

man
i

people
in

are

with

i
might
not
be

in

tell
me
how
can
two

ahve
the

with

manretard
cant

people
actually
put

golly
i
love
stupid
people
listen
rex
this
is
hockey
the
nhl
to
be
precise
and
in
the
nhl
there
exist
these
things
called
ties
a
tie
occurs
when
a
game
ends
with
the
score
for
each
team
equal
each
team
gets
one
point
for
a
tie
there
also
exits
these
things
called
wins
a
win
is
when
one
team
has
a
higher
score
than
the
opponent
oh
yeah
only
two
teams
play
each
other
at
a
time
so
i
can
say
the
opponent
a
team
gets
two
points
for
a
win
so
lets
say
that
a
team
has
a
record
of
wins
losses
and
ties
another
team
has
a
record
of
wins
losses
and
ties
the
first
team
has
points
the
second
team
has
points
wow
they
both
have
the
same
number
of
points
but
the
number
of
wins
is
different
how
did
they
do
that
thats
amazing
so
rex
when
people
talk
about
wins
being
the
first
tiebreaker
well
then
thats
what
it
means
in
our
example
the
second
team
would
win
the
tiebreaker
and
therefore
have
the
better
record
even
though
both
teams
had
the
same
number
of
points

i
dont
even
understand

problem
if
they
didnt
think
enough
people
would
not
watch
the

why
would
they
decide
to
show
most
of
the

and
if
they
showed
the

hours
of
the

would
it
hurt
to

they

the
hot

at
the

stadium
are
the
best
food
in
all
the
arenas
in
the
nhl
from
there
don
commented
on
the
quebecmontreal
game
the
game
had
great
flow
because
referee
paul
stewart
calls
the
best
game
in
the
nhl
in
contrast
the
calgaryla
game
was
terrible
all
stopandgo
over
minutes
of
penalties
called
against
calgary
by
dan
marouelli
its
getting
so
that
the
ref
who
calls
the
most
penalties
gets
to

in

next
ron
showed

several
key
injuries

gainey
is

ever
i
stand
by
that
assessment
he
was
a
very
good
player
who
belongs
in

hall
of
fame
did
you
ever
watch
him
play
he
never
made

i

i
have

and
that
includes
russell
courtnall
and
davie

screw
up

i

for

minutes
he

while
i

actually

i

make

less

half

the

argument
is

as
neither

that
was

so
in

if
roussel
shuts

shuts

thats
immaterial
because
it
was

come
on
joe
think
about
what
youre
saying
who
they
played
is
very
significant
why
they
played
them
is
whats
irrelevent
a
low
gaa
against
good
teams
is
better
than
a
low
gaa
against
bad
teams
in

a
low

is
better
then
a
higher
gaa
a
low

good
teams
is
much
much
better
than
a
higher
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
despite
last
nights
shutout
he
doesnt
have
what
it
takes
last
night
was
due
to
an
inept
ranger
team
much
more
than
roussels
skill
a
on
and
they
dont
get
a
shot
away
a
on
none
and
one
guy
just
passes
and
stops
the
other
guy
shoots
into
roussels
pad
cmon
pete
so
the
rangers
were
inept
a
shutout
is
a
shutout
during
both
of
soderstroms
masterpieces
against
toronto
mike
emerich
was
quoted
as
saying
he
didnt
think
the
leafs
had
much
offensive
firepower
past
their
first
line
does
that
make
soderstroms
shutouts
less
impressive
because
of
torontos
lack
of
offense
yes
it
does
absolutely
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
of
course
at
the
end
of
the
season
points
is
points
no
matter
how
you
get
them
and
on
the
score
sheets
shutouts
are
shutouts
but
if
youre
a
coach
deciding
between
two
goalies
or
a
gm
looking
to
make
a
trade
you
have
got
to
look
deeper
than
the
stat
sheets
i
didnt
see
the
second
toronto
game
but
the
first
one
was
a
defensive
masterpiece
there
was
nothing
in
that
game
to
judge
tommy
soderstrom
on
because
he
wasnt
tested
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
scoring
chances
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
you
have
very
little
to
go
by
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
habs
you
saw
a
goalie
stand
on
his
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
was
a
goalie
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
well
if
you
look
back
to
november
when
roussel
was
the
goalie
soderstrom
was
being
treated
for
his
heart
ailment
the
flyers
finished
november
at
and
were
overall
and
theres
no
way
of
knowing
where
the
flyers
would
have
finished
if
soderstom
wasnt
wearing
the
oragne
n
black
im
glad
we
dont
have
to
find
out
anytime
soon
either
because
he
is
one
hell
of
a
player
i
would
take
him
over
roussel
right
now
but
i
still
think
dom
has
what
it
takes
to
be
the
guy
he
outperformed
hextall
enough
during
the
season
to
make

management
think
that
way
too
dont
be
so
sure
of
that

management
never
says
bad
thing
about
roussel
but
they
dont
say
too
much
on
the
good
side
either
ive
seen
at

two
interviews

every

was

certainly
pluggers
are
an

part
of
any
team
and
that
is
simply
because
there
are

players
to
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your

doug

for
that

i
would

either
gretzky

gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
gretzky
lemieux
gilmour
etc
do
not
play
the
role
of
checking

they
play
an
offensive
role
as
opposed
to
a
defensive
one
if
they
were
used
as
defensive
centres
it
would
be
a
waste
of
their
offensive
abilities
when
you
compare
gretzky
et
al
to
jarvis
gainey
etc
you
are
comparing
apples
and
oranges
it
is
like
me
telling
you
that
felix
potvin
isnt
very
good
because
a
team
would
be
better
if
the
had
lemieux
instead
of
him
sure
lemieux
is
a
better
player
but
he
is
a
different
type
of
player
for
a
team
to
be
successful
they
need
to
have
all
types
of
players
this
includes
defensive
forwards
when
compared
with
other
defensive
forwards
bob
gainey
is
the
greatest
defensive
forward
ever
he
is
the
player
whos
talents
best
suited
being
a
defensive
forward
who
completely
dominated
the
game
when
he
played
maybe
if
a
more
talented
player
such
as
gretzky
had
decided
to
waste
his
offensive
talents
and
play
defensively
he
could
have
been
a
better
defensive
forward
but
he
wasnt
bob
gainey
is
the
best
defensive

that

youd

but
to
each

im
not
sure
here
but
i
think
ignorance
is
really
a
function
of
a
lack

knowledge
and
not
formulating
an

hey
if
you
need
to
take
a
cheap
shot
then
by
all
means
go
aheadthats
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
i
think
gainey
would
be
honoured
to
know
that
youve
included
him
i
think
gainey
should
feel
honoured
to
know
that
he
is
remembered
at
all
my
word
such
vehemence
against
poor
ol
bob
gainey
why
does
he
bother
you
so
muchhe
was
an
effective
player
for
his
style
of
play
on
this
list
i
also
think
you
have
a
relatively
naive
view
about
what
wins
a
hockey
gamepluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
certainly
pluggers
are
an
integral
part
of
any
team
and
that
is
simply
because
there
are
not
enough
solid
twoway
players
to
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your
checking
centre
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvis
for
that
matter
i
would
take
either
gretzky
or
mario
as
my
checking
centres
do
you
think
gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
im
really
sorry
roger
but
you
have
lost
me
completely
here
why
dont
you
ask
me
if
i
would
rather
have
jesus
christ
himself
in
nets
now
if
you
were
to
compare
say
for
example
bob
gainey
with
guy
carbonneau
you
would
have
a
balanced
comparison
any
team
the
selke
is
designed
to
acknowledge
their
contributioni
think
that
most
people
understand
that
its
not
the
nobel
prizeso
settle
down
youre
wrong
again
the
selke
is
awarded
to
the
forward
that
does
the
best
job
defensively
and
this
may
or
may
not
be
the
best
plugger
if
gilmour
does
the
best
defensive
job
in
the
league
i
dont
see
why
he
should
be
out
of
the
running
simply
because
he
also
contributes
offensively
im
wrong
againhmmm
lets
seewhere
was
i
wrong
in
the
first
place
im
only
guessing
here
rog
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
youve
setup
a
youre

macro
key
on

machine
i
agree
that
my
use
of
the
word
plugger
is
simplisticbut
i
think
you
know
what
im
getting
at
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
gilmours
potential
as
a
selkewinner
was
never
part
of
the
debateare
you
asking
me
for
an
opinion
if
so
i
think
there
are
far
too
many
other
deserving
players
to
include
gilmour
among
the
candidates
settle
down
if
you
think
that
i
have
likened
the
selke
to
the
nobel
prize
then
i
suggest
that
you
had
best
settle
down
and
if
you
are
going
to
try
to

let
me

you
settle

miami

i
think
as
do
the

that
hockey

well
in

there
is
a

of
people
from
the
northeast
that
spend
their

every

as
for
the

someone
will
have

displaying
your
ignorance
of

but
to
each
his
own
roger
im
not
sure
here
but
i
think
ignorance
is
really
a
function
of
a
lack
of
knowledge
and
not
formulating
an

hey
if
you
need
to

by
all

go
aheadthats
if
it
makes
you
feel
better

knowledgeable
observers
of
the

my

is
obvious
your

is
not
my

my

what
the

are
you
talking
about
im
not
even
going
to
try
to
refute
this
absolutely
insane
statement
my
word
such
vehemence
against
poor
ol
bob
gainey
why
does
he
bother
you
so
muchhe
was
an
effective
player
for
his
style
of
play
he
was
just
another
player
to
laud
him
as
anything
more
i
find
bothersome
i
hated
the
habs
i
hated
lafleur
until
i
realized
that
he
was
likely
the
most
aesthetically
pleasing
player
to
ever
skate
in
my
lifetime
why
would
anyone
talk
about
gainey
i
hate
the
habs
you
sound
like
a
old
this
statement
is
just
further
exemplifies
your
total
inability
to
argue
objectively
about
hockey
dont
give
me
this
crap
about
cogent
argumentsive
yet
to
read
something
of
yours
that
is
cogent
you
consistently
argue
with
emotion
huge
sweeping
statements
frankly
you
have
a
very
unconvincing
style
im
not
defending
bob
gaineyfrankly
i
dont
care
for
him
all
that
much
but
your
dismissal
of
him
as
something
less
than
an
effective
hockey
player
is
tiresomeit
has
no
basis
in
anything
how
many
calders
did
he
win
i
think
it
was
four
go
ahead
and
refresh
my
memory
what
about
the
conn
smythe
was
that
a
fluke
yeah
not
the
makings
of
a
hockey
superstar
i
know
but
try
to
have
a
reason
any
reason
to
shoot
him
down
go
around
who
would
you
rather
have
as
your
checking
centre
doug
gilmour
or
doug
jarvis
for
that

i
would
take
either
gretzky

as

do
you
think
gretzky
could
cover
bob
gainey
im
really
sorry
roger
but
you
have
lost
me
completely
here
why
dont
you
ask
me
if
i
would

have
jesus
christ
himself
in

did
he
play
hockey
at
a
high
level
was
he
any
good
if

would
you

to
bring
jc
up
i
am

here
if
you
cant
follow
the

dont
follow
up
as
i

previously
it
is

you
hey
cowboy
youre
the
expert
who
introduced
the
idiotic
comparison
of
gainey
with
gretzky
and
lemieuxyou
figure
it
out
now
if
you
were
to
compare
say
for

bob
gainey
with
guy
carbonneau
you
would
have
a
balanced

you

the

im

i
have
a
feeling
that
youve
setup

macro
key
on

that
is

be

oh

i
would

that
your

when

yes

has
claimed

they
are

gods
tarasov
claimed
that
gainey
was
a

god
and
greg
ate
it
up
and
that
is
what
this
thread
is
all
about
if
you
didnt
know
that
then
why
are
you
responding
you
seem
to
have
allowed
all
of
these
other

fall
into
your
sweeping
vacuous
statementthats
why
if
you
want
to
debate
gainey
go

why
bring
up
everybody
else
how
does
it
support
your
argument
do
you
have
an
argument
or
do
you
just
like
to
throw
around
a
few
names
hoping
to
impress
us
and
as
for
blanket
disregard
for
these
individuals
i
can
remember
leaf
teams
purely
populated
by
such
individuals
winning
four
stanley
cups
teams
no
one
ran
around
telling
us
that
george
armstrong
was
the
best
hockey
player
in
the
world
great
i
couldnt
agree
more
the
flyers
won
two
cups
for
the
same
reasonsdeservedly
so
so
what
i
dont
get
it
are
you
angry
that
the
leafs
didnt
get
more
recognition
you
seem
to
think
these
pluggers
are
hypedi
dont
agreeplain
and
simple
if
youre
last
statement
is
some
sort
of
compromise
fair
enough
you
might
consider
developing
your
own
style
after
all
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
flattery
is
not
your
intention
cmonit
has
a
nice
ring
to
itand
admit
it
you
had
a
good
laugh
right
i
had
to
get
to
the
end
of
your
posting
before
i
realized
you
were
a
complete
joke
not
a
pleasant
bone
in
your
body
eh
rog
why
are
you
so
unhappy
not
getting
invited
to
enough
parties
what
in
the
future
if
you
are
going
to
respond
to
my

i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
present
a
cogent
argument
supported
by
facts
gleaned
from
a
version
of
reality
that
most
of
the
rest

us
would
recognize

the
impression
that

a

on

are
a

certainly
it

far
from
perfect
and
my

all

that

sharks
review
part
goaltenders
as
the
sharks
season
came
to
a
close
tonight
i
will
start
a
series
of
posts
trying
to
revisit
the
players
the
trades
the
moves
etc
that
went
through
for
the
sharks
for
the
past
season
if
you
are
uninterested
since
i
will
have
the
words
sharks
review
in
the
subject
heading
in
these
postings
you
can
kill
them
i
will
first
try
to
evaluate
how
the
players
did
these
ratings
of
course
are
subject
to
my
own
biases
but
i
hope
that
i
can
try
to
be
as
objective
as
possible
i
will
evalute
players
who
finished
the
season
with
the
sharks
andor
did
not
play
for
another
nhl
team
this
season
thus
then
lets
go
to
the
goaltenders
brian
hayward
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
p
d
it
is
sad
that
his
career
has
to
come
to
this
dim
an
end
a
career
that
featured
sharing
three
jennings
trophies
with
patrick
roy
in
and
it
would
indeed
be
unfair
for
me
to
do
anything
but
give
him
a
passing
grade
and
skip
the
letter
grading
but
he
had
simply
been
awful
on
ice
this
year
save
for
a
bright
spot
or
two
and
even
if
he
had
been
healthy
he
would
not
be
any
more
than
the
goalie
but
hayward
was
a
classy
individual
who
also
figured
in
on
the
sharks
first
ever
victory
the
game
of
the
season
last
year
against
the
calgary
flames
as
he
retires
the
fans
will
remember
what
a
good
guy
he
was
jeff
hackett
season
acquired
from
n
y
islanders
in
expansion
draft
grade
c
hackett
after
deservedly
winning
the
team
mvp
honors
last
season
simply
wasted
the
year
other
than
a
few
good
spots
saves
against
los
angeles
almostshutout
against
tampa
bay
etc
hackett
finishing
with
save
percentage
and
a
gaa
watched
his
status
go
from
the
teams
goalie
to
bench
decoration
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
was
expected
early
to
carry
the
team
along
instead
he
apparently
became
frustrated
but
the
an
early
injury
that
forced
him
to
miss
games
may
have
been
a
contributing
factor
but
upon
return
he
simply
wasnt
up
to
the
task
he
may
not
return
next
year
wade
flaherty
season
still
eligible
as
rookie
acquired
signed
as
undrafted
free
agent
grade
i
a
it
is
pretty
hard
to
evaluate
a
goaltender
on
just
one
game
alone
thus
the
incomplete
grade
but
yet
in
the
one
start
that
he
did
get
against
the
calgary
flames
flaherty
was
nothing
but
sharp
for
at
least
two
periods
he
started
the
season
poorly
in
kansas
city
but
finished
strong
prompting
the
blades
owner
ron
parker
to
comment
that
he
should
be
a
candidate
for
the
ihl
mvp
honors
the
upcoming
ihl
playoffs
would
be
a
major
challenge
for
him
as
he
tries
to
make
it
into
the
nhl
last
year
he
was
a
capable
backup
for
arturs
irbe
in
the
throughout
the
season
and
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
picking
up
allstar
honors
along
with
irbe
now
its
time
for
him
to
show
that
he
can
share
the
job
with
irbe
next
year
because
with
prospects
dan
ryder
trevor
robins
and
scott
cashman
coming
along
if
he
doesnt
make
it
next
year
he
may
not
ever
arturs
irbe
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
b
i
may
yet
be
overly
critical
of
irbe
in
a
year
that
he
clearly
established
that
hes
a
bona
fide
nhl
goaltender
perhaps
a
bona
fide
goaltender
he
has
provided
most
of
the
little
highlight
footage
that
the
sharks
team
had
getting
the
teams
first
ever
shutout
against
the
los
angeles
kings
on
december
he
has
been
fearless
in
and
out
of
the
net
aggressively
playing
the
puck
and
making
passes
reminding
people
of
a
young
ron
hextall
except
of
course
the
goonism
yet
he
still
needs
to
develop
more
consistency
which
is
hard
to
do
with
such
a
bad
defense
in
front
of
him
but
if
the
sharks
are
to
challenge
for
a
playoff
spot
next

the

period
with

good
pressure

made
it
with

from

high
over

then
during
the
finnish
pressure
sweden
turned
the
game
around
in
mikael

worked
hard
behind
the
finnish
goal
and
passed
the
puck
to
jan
larsson
in
front
who
backhanded
the
puck
low
rundqvist
entered
the
finnish
zone
and
passed
to
ahlund
and
the
finnish
defense
let
ahlund
skate
in
and
take
a
shot
that
ketterer
dropped
into
the
goal
next
roger
hansson
behind
the
goal
sent
the
puck
back
to
the
blue
line
where
roger
akerstrom
took
a
slap
shot
and
ketterer
didnt
see
the
puck
since
there
was
traffic
in

third
period
started
with
a
nice
goal
by
stefan
the
shadow
nilsson
stefan
and
patrik
juhlin
entered
the
finnish
zone
patrik
passed
the
puck
back
to
stefan
who
alone
with
ketterer
made
no
mistake
then
keijo
sailynoja
show
started
he
reduce
and
equalized
the
lead
in
only
seconds
first
he
scored
the
goal
and
after
that
he
came
in
alone
with
aslin
but
was
tripped
by
aslin
to
get
a
penalty
shot
sailynoja
made
a
nice
penalty
shot
showed
forehand
and
put
in
with
a
low
backhand
shot
the
swedes
seemed
to
head
for
a
win
when
mikael
renberg
scored
the
goal
late
in
the
game
on
a
nice
power
play
combination
renberg
waited
in
the
slot
showed
that
he
wanted
the
puck
on
the
backhand
side
ahlund
passed
the
puck
and
renberg
took
a
turnaround
shot
low
in
ketterers
goals
far
side
but
jari
korpisalo
had
other
plans
as
he
only
seconds
later
scored
the
games
final
goal
to
make
it
korpisalo
took
a
slap
shot
from
a
narrow
angle
that
maybe
aslin
should
have
saved
all
in
all
a
decent
game
where
the
defense
wasnt
the
best
both
teams
juggled
around
the
lines
a
bit
in
the
second
and
third
period
to
try
no
combinations
renberg
and
rundqvist
plays
well
together
in
the
swedish
team

now
what
if
the
two
teams
were
merged
this
has
been
proposed
in
tampere
with
ilves
lynx
and
tappara
axe
the
fans
wouldnt
take
it
they
rather
see
their
teams
out
of
the
playoffs
most
of
the
time
or
even
relegated
than
merged
its
not
that
difficult
to
understand
its
just
like
here
in
helsinki
you
grow
up
being
either
a
jokerit
or
hifk
fan
the
other
team
is
the
last
team
in
the
world
you
would
support
im
not
talking
about

about
extremely
deeply

helsingfors
ifk
have
been
around
since
but
fans
only
started
taking
hockey
seriously
in
the
so
i
think
youre
exagerating
here
however
its
been
proved
that
both
fan
groups
can
cheer
the
same
team
thats
the
finnish
national
team
maybe
thats
how
you
could
set
up
a
huge
franchise
in
finland
no
one
has
ever
said
that
the
team
must
be
called
after
one
city
or
play
all
its
games
on
one
arena
just
one
team
finland
and
team
sweden
in
the
nhl
just
wouldnt
make
any
sense
we
have
way
more
talent
than
of
the
total
of
north
american
talent
after
a
couple
of
seasons
you
would
never
see
the
cup
going
anywhere
outside
the
nordic
presuming
that
our
teams
would
have
the
advantage
in
drafting
local
talent
as
prooposed
thats
a
rather
bold
claim
in
the
light
of
how
successful
the
canadian
american
olympic
teams
have
been
and
theyve
had
to
play
according
to
our
set
of
rules
and
on
international
ice
the
olympic
teams
contained
about
as
much
talent
as
your
average
expansion
team
canada
had
eric
lindros
sean
burke
joe
juneau
and
chris
kontos
another
four
or
five
have
been

bret

shawn
mceachern
steve

ted
donato
joe

have
been

in
the
nhl
while
robb
stauber
has
done
well
for
the
kings
in
goal
nothing
more
in
fact
im
sure
that
an
allstar
team
assembled
from
the
best
finnish
league
teams
would
do
no
better
in
the
nhl
than
hartford
or
tampa
bay
currently
are
doing
but
what
happens
if
all
topclass
finnish
swedish
players
gradually
end
up
with
helsinki
stockholm
as
the
north
americanbased
ones
gradually
retire
and
no
canadianamerican

with

unit
pittsburgh

but
i
have
my
doubts
about
the
homebased
finnish
players
the
national
team
did
well
in
the
canada
cup
and
world
championships
largely
due
to
the
efforts
of
markus
ketterer
the
goalie
or
the
players
listed
above
and
luck
theres
presumably
a
lot
of
decent
players
in
finland
that
wouldnt
be
superstars
at
the
highest
level
but
still
valuable
role
players
however
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
sweden
is
easier
to
judge
because
they
have
more
players
in
north
america
their
points
total
players
is
seven
more
than
ottawas
top
players
combined
if
we
estimate
there
are
six
more
nhl
regulars
back
home
in
sweden
an
allswedish
team
would
assemble
about
skill
points
deducting
some
points
from
pittsburgh
ny
rangers
and
other
teams
that
rely
on
swedish
players
the
swedish
team
would
finish
in
sixth
place
about
as
high
as
boston
vancouver
calgary
and
montreal
on
paper
so
the
dynasty
talk
isnt
completely
unfounded
here
an
allfinnishallswedish
team
might
have
an
advantage
because
the
players
would
be
playing
at
home
half
of
the
time
wont
have
to
adapt
to
a
foreign
country
and
a
foreign
language
and
presumably
play
the
wideopen
european
variant
of
hockey
rather
than
have
to
learn
the
north
american
checking
game
however
if
free
agency
becomes
a
factor
the
top
scandinavian
players
still
might
end
up
playing
for
largemarket
teams
after
a
couple
of
years
the
same
way
edmontons
dynasty
crumbled
in

late
some
fringe
players
likely
will

teams

i
must

me
already
in

now
on

saku

player
if
we
consider

according

he
is

and
he
is

he
is
a

skates
well
can
score
gives
nice
passes
does
even
bodycheckings
he
is
really
something
to

in

the
size
isnt
always
everything
maybe
we
remember
harlamov
and
they
say
that
saku
is
still
growing
up
during
last

saku
isnt
that
small
any

i
guess
i
heard
he
is
tall
at
the

will
still

deepak

however
that
aside
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
changing
the
names
based
on
the
reasons
given
for
it
making
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
unique
divisional
names
based
on
individuals
who
do
deserve
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
unique
touch
that
differs
from
other
sports
in
addition
i
do
not
think
that
changing
divisional
names
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
people
that
are
interested
in
hockey
so
its
a
pointless
exercise
anyway
there
are
several
problems
with
the
way
the
game
is
being
presented
to
the
fans
i
feel
that
geographical
names
would
enhance
regional
loyalties
more
than
names
honouring
personages
and
of
course
they
would
not
appear
nearly
as
confusing
to
one
approaching
the
sport
for
the
first
time
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
points
system
percentages
as
used
in
the
other
major
sports
are
clearly
more
informative
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
standings
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calculation
to
account
for
games
in
hand
which
is
almost
always
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentages
claiming
perhaps
that
it
is
an
americanization
of
the
sport
but
i
feel
that
using
percentages
is
more
informative
and
whether
it
is
american
or
not
is
irrelevant
if
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
then
that
is
a
separate
issue
not
central
to
the
original
article
something
to
consider
additionally
is
whether
or
not
players
like
orr
who
contributed
to
the
glory
of
the
sport
would
have
been
able
to
do
so
without
an
organized
professional
league
to
play
in
in
this
case
honouring
builders
of
the
league
as
opposed
to
builders
of
the
sport
becomes
a
chickenandegg
type
question
although
it
was
the
chicken
even
if
orr
couldnt
have
contributed
without
the
likes
of
norris
you
would
have
to
agree
that
norris
couldnt
have
contributed
without
the
likes
of
orr
and
taking
a
poll
of
most
fans
would
quickly
tell
you
who
the
fans
feel
made
the
more
meaningful
contribution
exactly
true
naming
divisions
and
trophies
after
smythe
and
the
bunch
is
the
same
kind
of
nepotism
that
put
stein
in
the
hall
of
fame
i
have
always
thought
that
this
was
nonsense
dunno
if
the
stein
comparison
is
justifiable
since
it
doesnt
look
as
though
his
unanimous
acceptance
to
the
hall
will
hold
up
it
doesnt
look
as
if
the

names
are
going
to
hold
up

the
owner
of

sorry
i
cant

his
name
either
owns
or
at

shelled
out
the

bradley
center
lloyd
pettit
supposedly
he
was
approached
by
the

about
an

franchise

turned
it
down

he

the

fee
of
million
was

high
like
i

i

this
story
is
true
or
just
a
rumor
but
if
its

dont
look
for
an
nhl

in

anytime
soon
the
admirals
arent
going
to
be
forced
out
of

building
and
you
wont
see

club
and

club
in

since
the

play

for

at

the
reason
was
that
the
established
market
for
teams
was
much
less
than
that
he
felt
that
no
one
would
pay
for
an
expansion
team
and
that
he
would
simply
wait
to
buy
an
existing
franchise
for
less
than
that
but
the
market
fooled
him
and
teams
have
been
created
for
apiece
in
the
last
three
years
and
even
the
existing

cant
be
moved
for
less

you
obviously
dont
understand
how
tv
scheduling
works
espn
had
prior
contracts
to
baseball
to
show
monday
night
games
and
had
contracted
all
the
other
bs
shows
well
in
advance
the
nhl
tv
deal
was
very
late
in
the
scheduling
process
you
normally
have
to
do
this
oneplus
year
out
the
nhl
package
was
finished
two
weeks
before
the
season
started
espn
has
shown
tremendous
commitment
to
the
nhl
by
squeezing
in
extra
telecasts
when
it
could
like
the
last
minnesota
game
and
putting
stanley
cup
games
as
backup
to
their
baseball
telecasts
which
by
favorable
circumstances
they
could
pull
off
last
night
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
espn
cannot
break
contracts
at
will
they
must
honor
the
previous
deals
they
made
does
have
something
to
do
with
it
especially
if
you
risk
a
lawsuit
for

of

period
the

used
the
phrase
initiate
not
retaliate
and
it
was
very
evident
here
in

period
as

continued

continued

to

the

got
shoveled
into

knocked

checked
him
from

boards
drawing
a
major
and
a
game
misconduct
at
the

unfortunately
the
kings
squandered
the
minute
power
play
when

at

watters
at
took

the

closed
to

macinnis
at

up

drove
a
shot
off

in

of

the

started
on
another
faceoff
that
the

converted

sandstrom
skating
down

in

zone
cut
towards
the
back
of

just
as
he
crossed
the

line
he
passed
the

into

low

on
the

to
carson
who
shot
off
the
pass
beating
vernon
on
the
ice
stick
side
at
the

skrudland
went
off
for
slashing
and
stern
went
crazy
as
he
went
after
shuchuk
stern
wound
up
with
a
double
minor
for
roughing
a
single
minor
for
cross
checking
and
a
minute
misconduct
and
he
took
the
flames
right
out
of
the
game
on
the
plus
side
the
kings
for
the
most
part
played
very
disciplined
hockey
as
they
let
calgary
retaliate
the
kings
played
good
team
defense
and
excellent
penalty
killing
on
the
minus
side
the
kings
lost
almost
every

this
must

this
in

has
anyone
done
better
the
year
before
he
took
over
the

didnt
even
make

there
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
during

the

did
ok

that
was
due
to
demers

didnt

talent
gerald
murray
wasnt

im
not

thats
a
horrible
pick
they
hired
him
after

has
never
made

me
his

was
lapointe

one

can
maintain

teams
success

cant
push
them
to
the
next
level
when
jacques
demers
brought
the
wings
to
the
conference
finals
twice
a
few
years
back
he
had
everyone
on
the
team
giving
percent
but
he
had
very
little
talent
he
had
yzerman
bob
probert
who
had
drinking
problems
at
the
time
and
a
couple
of
decent
goaltenders
in
hanlon
and
stefan
who
got
hot
thats
about
it
can
you
name
one
player
on
those
earlier
teams
who
even
deserved
to
be
in
the
allstar
game
much
less
actually
got
there
other
than
yzerman
and
probert
like
petr
klima
give
me
a
break
when
they
faced
edmonton
in
both
of
those
conference
finals
as
hard
as
they
played
it
was
clear
they
faced
a
team
that
simply
had
superior
talent
to
the
wings
thats
why
they
could
not
get
to
the
finals
also
at
that
time
the
norris
division
was
still
the
weakest
division
in
hockey
and
getting
past
chicago
and
toronto
was
not
as
impressive
as
it
is
today
murray
has
brought
scoring
talent
to
the
wings
that
they
did
not
have
a
few
years
ago
when
devellano
was
gm
and
demers
was
coach
to
name
a
few
ysebaert
kozlov
and
paul
coffey
who
has
made
a
definite
positive
impact
on
the
power
play
especially
murray
has
built
one
of
the
most
talented
teams
in
hockey
at
the
present
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
pittsburgh
penguins
the
wings
have
at
least
five
goal
scorers
that
i
can
think
of
and
a
couple
of
defenseman
with
over
games
worth
of
playoff
experience
murrays
one
failing
is
that
unlike
the
other
gms
you
mentioned
who
are
definitely
also
good
dont
get
me
wrong
he
has
not
found
for
himself
a
strong
coach
to
motivate
the
team
to
go
out
and
give
percent
for
the
full
minutes
every
night
like
they
did
the
last
time
they
made
a
cup
run
when
a
team
wins
or
loses
its
a
reflection
of
the
gm
and
the
coach
which
was
the
point
of
my
original
post
if
the
team
outmatches
their
opponent
in
terms
of
talent
but
loses
anyway
which
has
been
the
case
this
year
when
the
wings
have
struggled
that
indicates
that
the
gm
has
done
his
job
in
building
up
the
team
but
the
coach
has
failed
to
motivate
them
if
as
in
the
case
of
the
last
run
the
wings
made
in
the
playoffs
before
murray
came
they
gave
opponents
a
hard
time
who
should
have
beaten
them
easily
that
indicates
good
coaching
making
up
for
a
lack
of
talent
all
of
this
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
was
a
bad
gm
i
merely
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contender
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
as
great
as
you
claim
the
wings
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probably
more
than
once
if
he
was
as
great
a
gm
as
you
claim
and
he
was
as
poor
a
coach
as
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intelligent

before

two
years

was

before
they
got
francis

remember
randy

who
really
plays
tough

circle

nobody
with
all
the

francis
has

winning

putting

every

just
wanted
to
glow
a
little
i
know
what
you
mean
i
glow
everytime
ronnies
out
on
the
ice
in
fact
one
of
the
neatest
things
about
seeing
the
pens
in
person
is
that
i
can
key
in
on
him
instead
of
watching
what
id
probably
be
seeing
on
tv
he
does
so
many
subtle
things
behind
the
play
he
said
in
an
interview
recently
that
when
he
was
a
kid
his
dad
stressed
the
importance
of
playing
twoway
hockey
that
you
have
to
learn
how
to
play
defense
as
well
as
offense
and
he
obviously
took
that
advice
to
heart
he
was
a
breath
of
fresh
air
when
he
arrived
in
pittsburgh
to
the
team
whose
forwards
for
the
most
part
couldnt
and
wouldnt
play
a
lick
of
defense
its
really
difficult
to
assess
what
the
key
trades
were
that
brought
all
of
this
success
to
the
pens
you
mention
rick
tocchet
and
he
has
certainly
helped
and
even
ol
kjell
has
been
steady
but
looking
at
this
team
you
could
almost
take
any
one
of
them
out
of
the
lineup
permanently
and
replace
them
with
an
extremely
mediocre
player
and
it
wouldnt
matter
if
i
had
to
pick
the
top
three
acquisitions
in
recent
years
they
would
be
tom
barrasso
ron
francis
larry
murphy
id
love
to
put
francis
first
but
i
do
think
the
only
thing
that

to

he

that

it

not
the
people
who
put

i
recall
the
author
of
the
original
article
that
started
the
thread
claimed
that
he
disliked
the
changing
of
the
names
for
a
variety
of
reasons
roger
on
one
front
you
flamed
him
rather
severely
on
the
grounds
that
his
was
a
jingoistic
rant
but
you
also
supported
the
namechanging
on
the
grounds
that
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
because
of
the
individuals
they
represent
fwiw
i
do
not
think
the
flaming
was
warranted
nor
do
i
think
you
enhanced
what
credibility
you
have
with
it
at
all
just
an
observation
however
that
aside
the
real
question
is
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
changing
the
names
based
on
the
reasons
given
for
it
making
it
easier
for
the
casual
fan
or
whether
you
like
the
idea
of
unique
divisional
names
based
on
individuals
who
do
deserve
the
honour
imo
the
latter
is
a
nice
and
unique
touch
that
differs
from
other
sports
in
addition
i
do
not
think
that
changing
divisional
names
will
have
an
effect
on
the
number
of
people
that
are
interested
in
hockey
so
its
a
pointless
exercise
anyway
if
the
current
names
are
inappropriate
then
that
is
a
separate
issue
not
central
to
the
original
article
something
to
consider
additionally
is
whether
or
not
players
like
orr
who
contributed
to
the
glory
of
the
sport
would
have
been
able
to
do
so
without
an
organized
professional
league
to
play
in
in
this
case
honouring
builders
of
the
league
as
opposed
to
builders
of
the
sport
becomes
a
chickenandegg
type
question
although
it
was
the
chicken
exactly
true

he

he

his

depalma

an
excellent
week
scoring

playing
good

unfortunately
the
depalma
then
disappeared
the
rest
of
the
way
getting
just
more
points
in
more

and
generally
looked
lethargic
and
uninterested
on
both

he
then
was

down

walked
out
from

was

johan

bob

and
round
pick
in
entry
draft
from
vancouver
grade
aa
after
an
early
slump
garpenlov
was
nothing
short
of
inspirational
the
rest
of
the
way
finishing
with
points
in

second
highest
total
on
the
team
as
he
clicked
well
with
team
mvp
kelly
kisio
and
right
wing
rob
gaudreau
kisio
got
most
of
the
credit
but
garpenlov
finishing
second
in
the
mvp
voting
clearly
demonstrated
his
playmaking
and
scoring
skills
as
he
was
seen
making
excellent
centering
passes
as
well
as
finishing
passes
to
him
by
putting
the
puck
past
opposing
goaltenders
getting
a
clubhigh
power
play

contrary
to

garpenlov
also
showed
that
despite
his
small
size
lbs
he
was
willing
to
throw
himself
around
when
necessary
albeit
not
very
successful
yet
he
also
still
needs
to
work
on
his
defense
although
he
improved
tremendously
throughout
the
season
and
was
actually
quite
a
good
penalty
killer
by
the
end
of
the
season
he
will
be
a
major
key
to
the

david

i
after
a
banner
when
he
led
the
team
in
powerplay
goals
and
was
third
in
total
scoring
points
in

bruce
was
bothered
virtually
all
of
this
season
with
a
groin
injury
which
kept
him
out
of
the
lineup
for
all
by
games
this
season
of
course
it
is
difficult
to
speculate
how
well
he
would
have
done
this
season
had
he
not
been
affected
by
the
injury
but
the
bruce
was
effective
with
a
man
up
or
a
man
short
in
the
sharks
first
season
and
was
expected
to
be
a
strong
offensive
leader
this
season
as
well
the
injury
appears
serious
which
is
a
shame
because
otherwise
he
may
have
a
much
brighter
future
for
now
instead
his
future
with

next

pederson
season
acquired
trade
with
philadelphia
for
clw
dave
snuggerud
grade
i
b
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
understand
the
flyers
decision
to
unload
pederson
after
a
very
good
offensive
season
last
season
points
in
games
but
after
riding
the
pine
early
in
the
season
pederson
was
summarily
sent
to
the
sharks
in
exchange
of
the
defensiveminded
snuggerud
and
he
finished
with
games
combined
with
the
flyers
and
the
sharks
he
was
also
limited
by
injuries
this
season
and
this
limited
his
production
points
but
when
healthy
pederson
appears
impressive
with
a
good
scoring
touch
good
size
and
the
willingness
to
throw
it
around
although
hes
not
considered
a
physical
forward
and
good
speed
he
also
does
not
appear
to
be
a
liability
on
defense
but
the
sharks
probably
have
to
wait
until
next
season
to
see
how
much
exactly
pederson
can
do
john
carter
season
acquired
free
agent
from
boston
grade
i
bb
carter
was
definitely
one
of
the
hardest
workers
on
the
team
and
the
hard
work
worked
wonders
as
at
times
he
looked
great
on
ice
however
although
he
did
look
great
at
times
the
fact
that
he
received
just
points
in
games
for
his
efforts
is
a
sign
that
there
is
only
so
much
his
hard
work
can
do
and
the
sharks
confirmed
that
by
sending
him
to
kansas
city
with
about
games
left
in
the
season
carter
who
will
turn
on
may
always
hussled
but
as
a
result
was
sometimes
trapped
too
deep
within
the
offensive
zone
while
forechecking
but
he
was
generally
a
credit
on
the
defensive
end
but
he
is
probably
of
limited
utility
in
that
capacity
and
he
did
not
impress
offensively
although
he
was
one
of
the
best
sharks
at
drawing
penalties
he
is
very
unlikely
to
be
back
next
season
jeanfrancois
quintin
season

draft
grade
i
bb
i
dont
understand
why
the
sharks
didnt
let
quintin
play
any
more
than
the
games
he
played
this
season
he
was
generally
hardworking
and
creating
opportunities
offensively
and
appeared
at
age
ready
for
regular
nhl
duty
at
least
for
a
team
like
the
sharks
finishing
with
points
in
those
games
while
not
being
a
defensive
liability
shoulder
injury
in
training
camp
before
the
season
limited
quintin
the
teams
leading
scorer
in
exhibition
games
despite
sitting
out
the
final
two
to
just
games
with
the
sharks
and
the
blades
that
season
but
he
looked
impressive
he
should
be
a
solid
contender
for
regular
duty
next
season
mark
beaufait
season
acquired
round
pick
in
supplemental
draft
grade
i
after
a
allstar
season
at
kansas
city
beaufait
got
a
cup
of
coffey
with
the
sharks
late
in
the
season
when
the
blades
knocked
down
a
playoff
spot
and
the
sharks
decimated
with
injuries
playing
games
and
scoring
a
goal
for
his
only
nhl
point
thus
far
despite
small
size
lbs
beaufait
was
not
shy
to
throw
himself
around
when
necessary
and
looked
pretty
good
at
times
although
its
too
early
to
judge
him
based
on
nhl
games
in
which
he
played
mostly
left
wing
away
from
his
center
position
at
northern
michigan
and
kansas
city
jaroslav
otevrel
season
acquired
round
pick
in
entry
draft
grade
i
like
beaufait
otevrel
also
played
away
from
his
normal
position
when
he
was
up
for
his
cup
of
tea
games
midway
through
the
season
he
was
generally
very
much
of
a
defensive
liability
and
did
not
show
much
offensively
either
although
that
may
be
more
indicative
of
the
lack
of
ice
time
he
got
in
those
games
he
may
need
another
season
to
work
on
his
defense
but
once
his
defense
is
acceptable
he
should
be
ready
michel

yvon
corriveau

i
bc
the
picard
although
he
perennially
tore
up
the
minors
seems
to
be
close
to
being
out
of
chances
for
some
reason
after
being
acquired
by
the
sharks
but
failing
to
impress
the
management
in
games
scoring
goals
for
his
only
points
and
he
spent
most
of
the
rest
of
the
way
in
kansas
city
he
was
not
particularly
strong
defensively
and
despite
his
offensive
brilliance
in
the
minors
he
has
failed
thus
far
to
score
in
the
nhl
although
he
has
been
given
limited
opportunities
he
may
be
the
sharks
bait

you
that
i
am

wood
thus
far
although
games
is
a
small
example
he
was
generally
a
nonfactor
on

was
not

good
defensively

took
too
many
silly
penalties
losing

fights
in

minutes
in

projecting

hes
not

and
needs
at

another

at

where
he
can
work
on
his

skills

nothing

this

it
then
appears
that
was

a
rather
disappointing

good

just
points

games

then
proceeded
to
improve
his

massively
this

the

most
reliable
defenseman
whom
the

can
count
on
night
in
and
night
out
to
play
steady
defense
and
providing
occasional
but
only
occasional
offensive
flash
offensively
he
was
even
more
disappointing
than
last
year
points
in
games
but
his
defense
improved
tremendously
he
is
probably
best
as
the
defensive
part
of
a

an
offensive
defenseman

wilkinson
season
acquired

in

draft
grade
b
wilkinson
was
probably
the
teams
top
defensive
defenseman
in
however
partially
because
of
injuries
he
was
not
the
same
this
year
as
he
missed
games
total
due
to
nagging
knee
and
back
injuries
and
seemed
to
be
slowed
even
when
playing
he
then
had
often
to
be
saved
by
his
defensive
partners
that
is
if
they
are
there
at
all
but
he
also
had
some
solid
games
and
if
he
can
be
complete
healthy
he
can
still
be
a
force

a
at

of
his
injury
december
against
the
philadelphia
flyers
ozolinsh
was
well
on
track
to
be
imo
the
teams
mvp
a
serious
knee
injury
in
that
game
though
forced
him
to
miss
the
rest
of
the
season
games
but
he
still
finished
as
the
teams
top
scorer
among
defensemen
points
which
of
course
tells
more
about
the
lack
of
offense
the
sharks
had
from
their
defensemen
but
it
also
tells
of
ozolinshs
abilities
at
the
time
he
was
playing
very
good
defense
along
with
excellent
offense
he
was
still
susceptible
to
socalled
rookie
mistakes
but
was
probably
the
defenseman
who
made
the
least
of
them
on
the
team

veteran

he
can
come
back
from

doug
zmolek
season
acquired
from
minnesota

draft
grade

zmolek
had
basically
a
solid
and
durable
year
being
one
of
the
only
two
sharks
to
play
in
all
games
of
the
season
he
was
solid
on
defense
but
after
being
billed
as
an
offensive
defenseman
he
didnt
show
it
points
he
was
also
prone
to
penalties
and
his
penalty
minutes
was
second
on
the
team
however
that
was
also
an
indication
that
he
was
fearly
when
facing
tough
physical
opponents
and
he
was
at
his
best
when
playing
physically
but
to
become
a
fixture
in
this
league
he
needs
to
improve
both
offensively

defensively

bowman
was
complaning
about
cheap

im
sorry
mr
bowman
youre
a
great
coach
but
those
cheap
shots
were
nothing
compared
to
whats
going

come
also
i

you
were

as

there
are
many
teams
in
the

who
have
taken
a
liking
to
russian
players
the
whole
russian
strategy
is
not
specific
to
detroit
or
to
devellano
who
was
gm
before
murray
what
the
previous
gm
also
did
was
to
trade
away
several
players
who
have
gone
on
to
do
well
with
other
teams
most
notably
in
my
memory
murray
craven
who
had
a
few
very
good
years
with
philly
after
leaving
here
also
its
not
the
volume
of
trades
that
will
necessarily
improve
a
team
but
the
quality
of
them
trading
adam
oates
for
bernie
federko
was
just
plain
stupid
even
if
federko
used
to
be
a
great
player
at
one
time
most
of
murrays
trades
have
worked
significantly
to
the
wings
advantage
with
those
that
didnt
being
soured
mainly
by
injury
to
the
players
involved
such
as
troy
crowder
who
suffered
back
problems
from
which
he
never
really
recovered
devallano
went
earlier
and
more
extensively
to
the
russian
strategy
than
anyone
elseand
was
the
first
gm
to
waste
high
draft
choices
on
young
russiansdevallano
would
still
be
gm
but
he
succombed
to
demers
pleading
to
make
the
oatesfederko
et
al
tradewhich
is
the
deal
that
sealed
his
fate
murray
has
made
some
decent
tradesno
doubtbut
these
are
more
due
to
the
stupidity
or
cheapness
of
other
teams
than
brilliance
on
his
partwashington
was
too
cheap
to
pay
ciccarelli
so
they
essentially
gave
him
awayand
carson
was
really
a
big
anchor
to
the
team
and
he
was
able
to
sucker
a
rookie
gm
to
give
him
paul
coffey
for
deadweight
if
detroit
still
fails
this
year
because
he
was
one
defenseman
short
then
he
will
have
wasted
an
opportunity
because
manson
was
available
and
he
was
unable

pull
the

it

good
morning
ladies
and

its

me
to
welcome
the

of
maine
black
bears
the
winner
of
the
ncaa
division
i
hockey
national
championship
to
the
rose
garden
and
the
white
house
i
understand
from
senator
mitchell
that
this
is
the
first
team
from
the
university
of
maine
every
to
win
a
national
championship
and
were
glad
to
have
them
here
im
inspired
not
only
by
how
the
team
pulled
together
to
win
the
championship
but
how
the
entire
state
pulled
together
to
cheer
them
onto
victory
coming
from
a
state
that
is
also
relatively
small
in
size
but
also
filled
with
pride
and
tradition
and
community
i
can
understand
how
the
people
of
maine
must
feel
about
the
black
bears
in
our
state
people
are
still
talking
about
the
time
we
won
the
orange
bowl
over
the
number
one
ranked
football
team
and
that
was
back
in
im
sure
that
years
from
now
the
people
of
maine
will
as
proud
of
this
team
as
they
are
today
you
know
in
my
state
football
is
a
slightly
more
popular
sport
than
hockey
we
dont
have
a
lot
of
ice
laughter
but
after
spending
three
months
getting
banged
around
in
this
town
i
can
understand
a
little
more
about
hockey
than
i
did
before
i
came
here
hockey
is
a
tough
game
its
a
hardhitting
sport
it
does
have
one
virtue
though
theres
a
penalty
for
delay
of
game
i
wish
we
had
that
rule
in
the
senate
laughter
in
government
as
in
hockey
leadership
is
important
in
the
united
states
senate
our
team
has
a
great
captain
the
majority
leader
and
the
senior
senator
from
maine
george
mitchell
junior
senator
cohen
looks
so
young
i
cant
imagine
laughter
im
actually
bitter
about
senator
cohen
because
he
looks
so
much
younger
than
me
on
your
hockey
team
the
captain
jim
montgomery
has
done
a
great
job
he
scored
the
winning
goal
late
in
the
championship
game
leading
you
to
a
comefrombehind
victory
something
else
i
know
a
little
bit
about
sport
brings
out
the
best
in
individuals
and
in
teams
and
in
communities
i
share
the
pride
that
senator
mitchell
and
senator
cohen
and
congressman
andrews
and
all
the
people
of
maine
must
feel
for
the
black
bears
who
have
shown
us
all
how
to
play
as
a
team
how
to
bring
out
the
best
in
one
another
and
how
to
come
from
behind
i
think
its
important
as
i
ask
young
people
from
around
america
who
have
achieved
outstanding
things
in
working
together
to
come
here
to
the
white
house
to
be
recognized
and
appreciated
by
their
country
to
remember
that
those
kinds
of
values
and
those
kinds
of
virtues
need
to
be
ingrained
in
all
of
us
for
all
of
our
lives
we
now
have
another
role
model
and
im
glad
to
have
them
here

no

made

that
was

is

a

the

and
i
will
i
want
to
refer
you
to
talk
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
fbi
i
knew
it
was
going
to
be
done
but
the
decisions
were
entirely
theirs
all
the
tactical
decisions
q
what
did
you
and
senator
mitchell
talk
about
this
morning
q
any
chance
for
that
stimulus
package
the
president
senator
mitchell
ought
to
pay
my
quarter
laughter
i
was
in
there
laughter
senator
mitchell
you
have
to
pay
that
quarter
the
president
i
was
ready
laughter
senator
mitchell
hes
worth
a
quarter
any
day
q
any
chance
for
your
bill
sir
the
president
we
talked
about
what
was
going
to
happen
this
week
in
the
senate
and
about
what
other
meetings
were
going
to
have
for
the
rest
of
the
week
we
only
had
about
five
minutes
to
talk
and
we
agreed
wed
get
back
together
later
around
noon
and
talk
some
more
q
senator
dole
said
over
the
weekend
that
your
compromise
is
no
compromise
the
president
well
i
know
he
did
but
look
senator
dole
and
a
lot
of
the
other
republicans
now
in
the
senate
voted
for
the
same
kind
of
thing
for
ronald
reagan
in
and
our
research
indicates
that
a
majority
of
them
over
time
voted
for
a
total
of
emergency
spending
measures
totalling
over
billion
when
reagan
and
bush
were
president
in
those
administrations
and
many
of
those
purposes
were
not
nearly
as
worthy
as
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
i
dont
want
to
go
back
and
revisit
every
one
but
you
can
do
it
you
can
look
at
the
research
there
so
this
position
theyre
taking
is
not
credible
we
have
a
very
tough
fiveyear
deficit
reduction
plan
all
these
costs
are
covered
during
that
time
and
then
some
and
the
very
people
that
are
saying
this
has
all
got
to
be
paid
for
dont
have
much
of
a
history
on
which
to
base
their
position
theyve
got
years
of
vote
for
stimulus
measures
of
this
kind
that
had
very
little
to
with
putting
the
american
people
back
to
work
so
i
think
weve
got
a
chance
to
work
it
out
and
im
hopeful
well
see
what
happens
today
and
tomorrow
im
feeling
pretty
good
about
it

the

announced
yesterday
that
they
will
have
fewer
broadcast
tv
games
and
will
have
games
on
some
sort
of
subscription
payperview
system
yuck
this
is
incorrect
this
year
the
pens
had
games
on
free
tv
and
games
on
ppv
next
year
they
will
have
games
on
free
tv
and
on
a
subscription
basis
you
actually
get
more
free
game
than
last
year
and
there
will
be
no
more
radioonly
games
its
a
good
deal
last
year
everybody
bitched
about
baldwin
breaking
up
the
team
now
he
goes
out
of
his
way
to
keep
the
nucleus
of
this
team
together
and
that
takes
money
he
comes
up
with
a
creative
way
to
generate
more
revenue
so
he
can
afford
this
team
and
people
bitch
some
more
everybody
wants
something
for
nothing

i
could
be

for
odd
consecutive
nights
i
havent
counted
so
thats
a

the
worst
thing
is
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
did
last

i
had
the

the

yes
id
rather
have

btw
those

were

i
was
quite

they

wasnt
likely
to
be
wellschooled

lore
and
they
did
an
excellent
job
they
were
quite
impartial
also
imo
i
think
thorne

the
best
part
is
that
he
is
the

way
when
he
is
earning
his

ie
unbiased
he
goes
orgasmic
for
goals
despite
which
team
scores
and
even
more
excited
if
possible
for
great
saves
he
did
a
good
job
of
explaining
certain
things
to
nonhockey

without
offending

leafs
versus
wings
how
long
can
the
leafs
play
shorthanded
and
still
be
expected
to
score
they
did
some
fine
penelykilling
in
the
first
men
down
for
a
couple
of
minutes
at
one
point
but
they
just
couldnt
keep
it
up
they
spent
virtually
the
entire
game
either
shorthanded
or
just
coming
off
a
penelty
as
soon
as
theyd
get
regrouped
theyre
penalized
again
sheesh
like
gilmour
said
after
the
you
cant
go
calling
every
little
push
an
shove
in
a
game
like
that
and
if
youre
going
to
you
have
to
do
it
for
both
teams
pearson
one
of
my
four
favorite
leafs
played
like
a
bonehead
i
saw
him
personally
screw
up
at
least
good
scoring
opportunities
and
then
he
got
that
bonehead
major
highsticking
penalty
cullen
has
gotten
stronger
since
his
return
from
injury
a
handfull
of
games
ago
and
he
played
a
good
game
if
the
other
players
on
his
line
can
smarten
up
that
line
should
do
okay
clarks
got
to
get
tough
hes
got
to
intimidate
and
go
for
the
net
send
clark
up
the
left
wing
over
the
blue
line
a
couple
times
his
patented
wrist
shot
will
put
some
numbers
on
the
board
and
pearson
heck
maybe
he
should
be
benched
i
hate
to
repeat
grapes
but
where
the
heck
was
foligno
zezel
cant
do
all
the
checking
himself
and
get
macllwain
on
the
move
we
need
some
speed
out
there
keep
potvin
in
net
he
did
okay
considering
although
like
i
said
a
couple
weeks
ago
potvin
messed
up
in
a
couple
games
in
the
ahl
playoffs
last
year
he
can
easily
do
it
again
my
prediction
last
week
was
toronto
in
that
the
games
det
wins
will
be
blowouts
and
the
game
tor
wins
will
be
close
i
still
stand
by
that
dont

in

the

match

hell
have
his

hard
and

allow

you

theres
a

a

is
worth
one
point
i
know
i
know
youre
not

at

but
bear
with
me
a

is
worth
two

so
getting
two
ties
is
the

as
getting
one
win
if
your

played
two
games
won
one

lost

youd
have
two

if
my

both

also
have

wed
be

all
of
this
is
fine
i
never
said
that
murray
was
a
bad
gm
i
merely
said
that
he
isnt
the
best
gm
in
hockey
or
even
a
contender
for
that
honor
if
murray
is
as
great
as
you
claim
the
wings
would
have
won
the
stanley
cup
by
now
probably
more
than
once
if
he
was
as
great
a
gm
as
you
claim
i
think
you
missed
one
of
my
points
there
it
takes
more
than
a
great
gm
to
win
a
stanley
cup
even
once
some
of
the
guys
on
the
list
you
gave
earlier
never
won
one
i
agree
that
you
and
i
could
probably
argue
back
and
forth
for
days
to
no
avail
about
who
is
the
best
gm
in
hockey
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
who
is
to
say
my
opinion
is
any
better
than
yours
or
yours
than
mine
but
the
point
of
my
original
original
post
if
not
well
stated
was
that
murray
has
the
gm
abilities
but
not
the
coaching
abilities
which
leads
to
below
and
he
was
as
poor
a
coach
as
you
claim
he
would
have
been
intelligent
enough
to
hire
the
coach
to
push
the
team
to
the
next
level
of
success
i
think
at
this
point
theres
a
personal
emotional
element
involved
here
which
transcends
murrays
logical
thought
as
outsiders
its
fine
for
us
to
say
he
should
hire
a
different
coach
in
fact
he
has
talked
about
doing
so
in
the
past
but
the
press
here
in
detroit
at
least
has
so
built
up
this
business
about
murray
never
getting
past
the
second
round
of
the
playoffs
as
a
coach
that
i
think
he
has
taken
it
upon
himself
to
prove
to
the
world
that
he
is
capable
of
coaching
a
team
past
the
second
round
he
needs
to
as
the
papers
say
get
that
monkey
off
his
back
so
it
becomes
a
matter
not
of
intelligence
but
of
pride
is
it
foolish
to
let
pride
stand
in
the
way
of
sound
logic
perhaps
but
were
all
a
little
that
way
from
time
to
time
i
think
eventually
hell
step
down
from
behind
the
bench
and
concentrate
on
his
gm
duties
and
the
team
will
improve
as
a
result
i
think
his
coaching
duties
take
away
time
he
might
have
otherwise
spent
on
gm
work
in
that
sense
once
he
steps
down
as
coach
well
see
how
good
of
a
gm
he
really
is
but
murray
is
an
average
unspectacular
nhl
coach
and
a
pretty
good
gm
so
none
of
this
is
true
anyway
i
may
not
agree
with
everything
youve
said
but
its
been
fun
discussing
it
with
you

was

etc
etc
well
the
key
doesnt
quite
fit
if
youre

i
dont
buy
this
at
all
roy
was
the
reason
the
game
was
tied
and
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
dionne
kept
his
cool
hextall
gave
up
very
questionable
goals
himself
both
dionnes
and
bellows
shots
were
misplayed
by
hextall
but
just
because
his
gaffes
were
early
in
the
game
no
one
seems
to
care
roy
stood
on
his
head
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
game
when
the
nords
were
rushing
from
endtoend
kamenskys
minibreak
after
the
tying
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excellent
chances
stopped
by
roy
roy
outplayed
hextall
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becomes
the
villain
and
hextall
the
hero
because
roys
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportunities
hextall
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucky
bounces
he
played
very
well
but
the
haller
shot
off
the
post
in
ot
the
rebound
bouncing
over
bellows
stick
the
brunet
breakaway
the
chances
for
leclair
all
those
opportunities
were
not
finished
off
by
montreal
and
it
cost
them
hextall
wasnt
particularly
brilliant
on
those
plays
blaming
stewart
is
just
an
excuse
to
avoid
facing
the
fact
that
roy
allowed
what
was
one
of
the
worst
goals
he
could
possibly
allow
he
even
saw
the
whole
shot
dammit
sure
no
excuse
but
it
was
just
the
goal
the
timing
stank
but
against
an
explosive
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportunity
too
many
with
a
powerplay
that
was
totally
unnecessary
montreal
played
a
solid
game
although
they
still
dont
know
how
to
clear
traffic
in
front
of
the
net
the
loss
of
schneider
will
hurt
even
more
i
disagree
roy
played
well
because
he
wasnt
screened
the
whole
night
the
defense
for
the
time
this
season
played
remarkably
keeping
sakic
nolan
and
sundin
out
of
the
slot
most
of
the
night
normally
i
would
say
that
any
team
that
blows
a
lead
with
less
than
five
let
alone
two
minutes
to
go
in
regulation
time
in
a
playoff
game
especially
needs
to
be
smacked
upside
their
collective
heads
but
i
dont
think
this
was
a
team
loss
although
keane
should
have
been
able
to
clear
the
zone
just
prior
to
the
first
quebec
goal
this
most
certainly
was
a
team
loss
leclair
missed
his
opportunities
as
did
bellows
and
brunet
dionne
took
a
bad
penalty
damphousse
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
means
can
be
singled
out
for
this
loss
roy
is
paid
big
money
to
play
he
looked
like
a
player
in
an
industrial
league
on
sakics
shot
and
hextall
didnt
on
dionnes
goal
please
roy
is
paid
big
money
because
that
is
his
value
compared
to
other
goalies
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
when
you
consider
the
defense
or
lack
of
one
that
played
in
front
of
him
for
most
of
the
season
demers
should
start
racicot
in
the
next
game
if
not
that
he
should
let
the
damn
team
read
the
papers
for
the
next
day
or
twoand
maybe
this
article
if
possible
the
montreal
media
is
the
quickest
to
heap
praise
and
then
hurl
derogatory
comments
against
the
habs
they
are
no
better
than
uninformed
fans
why
should
they
read
the
papers
they
played
minutes
of
burnsian
hockey
to
shut
down
quebec
all
they
need
tonight
and
for
the
rest
of
the
series
is
the
extra
red
light
to

thats
a
guaranteed
way
to
end
the

who
would
be
taught
a
lesson
by
this
the
fans
the
media
and
racicot
perhaps
certainly
not
the
rest
of
the
team
i
didnt
think
the
wraparound
was
as
bad
as
the
second
goal
i
also
didnt
think
scott
young
should
have
gotten
around
the
defender
cant
remember
who
in
the
first
place
but
you
are
correct
it
shouldnt
have
gone
in
regardless
if
you
mean
the
goal
should
never
have
gone
in
because
there
should
never

the
goal
itself
was
a

piece

i
think
that
jack
ferreiras
firing
eventually
led
to
kingstons
firing
you
mention
consistency
of
vision
i
think
the
sharks
lost
that
with
the
loss
of
ferreira
there
has
never
been
a
headed
gm
that
has
ever
worked
you
need
one
person
making
the
personnel
decisions
at
the
top
not
management
by
committee
the
conventional
wisdom
from
around
the
league
is
that
ferreira
would
have
made
the
moves
that
would
have
fielded
a
better
product
on
the
ice
how
exactly
would
ferreira
accomplished
this
the
threeheaded
gmship
has
taken
a
lot
of
heat
but
nobodys
explained
how
things
would
have
been
any
different
had
ferreira
still
been
there
would
ferreira
have
made
more
trades
who
would
have
he
had
traded
would
he
have
made
fewer
trades
who
should
not
have
been
traded
i
think
the
threeheaded
gms
guiding
principle
was
to
keep
veterans
in
favor
of
youngsters
only
if
they
offered
a
significant
advantage
at
the
end
of
last
season
the
contracts
of
several
veterans
with
somewhat
maginal
contributions
fenton
bozek
anderson
and
a
couple
others
i
cant
remember
were
bought
out
the
idea
was
that
youngsters
could
play
almost
as
well
and
had
the
potential
to
improve
where
these
older
guys
did
not
and
they
traded
mullen
because
he
wanted
to
go
not
because
he
wasnt
good
enough
but
i
think
they
were
a
bit
too
optimistic
in
thinking
they
could
make
up
for
his
contributions
an
example
from
this
season
skriko
was
brought
in
on
a
trial
basis
but
not
kept
because
of
his
age
i
thought
he
was
a
decent
contributor
worth
keeping
around
the
youth
movement
has
its
advantages
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veterans
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balance

minnesota
scene
to
those
who
are
wondering
what
is
happening
in
minnesota
from
what
i
have
seen
in
the
local
news
tv
and
newspaper
various
people
in
the
area
are
trying
to
get
a
new
hockey
team
a
columnist
for
the
st
paul
pioneer
press
wrote
an
article
giving
the
inside
scoop
on
the
issue
there
are
three
local
sites
competing
for
a
team
and
three
possible
candiates
to
move
to
the
twin
cities
first
the
sites
target
center
civic
center
st
paul
and
yes
even
the
met
center
the
columnist
was
pretty
confident
that
minnesota
will
get
a
team
and
that
the
target
center
will
ultimately
win
out
he
argued
however
that
the
competition
from
the
other
two
sites
will
delay
the
process
considerably
without
the
intersite
competition
the
columnist
sorry
i
cant
remember
his
name
believes
that
minnesota
would
have
a
team
by
the
season
also
because
of
the
situation
with
the
timberwolves
things
will
be
delayed
until
unless
the
city
of
minneapolis
takes
over
the
target
center
however
they
are
unlikely
to
do
so
until
the
met
center
is
destroyed
because
the
city
will
lose
money
if
there
is
competition
from
the
met
for
conventions
and
shortterm
events
even
with
hockey
at
target
to
add
to
this
mess
a
study
to
months
is
going
to
be
conducted
on
the
future
viability
of
the
met
center
which
obviously
delays
the
process
even
further
i
hope
that
the
study
is
cancelled
which
will
have
the
effect
of
knocking
the
met
center
out
of
the
running
and
perhaps
encouraging
minneapolis
to
take
over
the
target
center
sooner
the
city
would
be
be
even
more
encourged
if
the
wrecking
ball
is
taken
to
the
met
which
may
happen
regarding
possible
candidates
the
three
teams
are
hartford
tampa
bay
and
new
jersey
i
would
prefer
the
devils
minnesota
ice
demons
although
the
lightning
may
have
potential
although
it
hasnt
been
announced
yet
it
looks
like
neutral
site
games
will
be
played
at
the
target
center
next
year
apparently
the
devils
are
interested
in
playing
in
as
many
of
those
six
games
as
possible
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
hartford
and
tampa
show
up
there
either
so
minnesota
may
end
up
getting
another
team
but
it
may
take
a
few
years

how
extensive

coverage
down
there
in

it
is
almost
impossible
not
to

the
only
two
series
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
watch
this

are
washnyi
and
chistl
the
latter
because
im
in
the
wrong
time
zone
we
in
canada
are
basically
swamped
with
coverage
and
i
wonder
how
many
seriesgames
are
televised
nationally
or
even
locally
in
the
us
and
how
much
precedence
they
take
over
say
local
news
if
the
games
go

not

it

you
even
saw
the

mike
smith
came
out
from
behind
his
own
net
and
fired
a
breakout
pass
that
hit
fuhr
in
the
back
of
the
leg
fuhr
was
backing
up
at
the
time
and
never
saw
what
happened
the
puck
went
straight
off
fuhrs
leg
and
into
the
net
fuhr
never
had
a
chance
there
was
no
play
back
to
the
goaltender
in
fact
perry
berezan
of
calgary
had
just
dumped
it
in
and
smith
was
retrieving
it
it
was
unfortunate
that
it
happened
smith
is
a
nice
guy
and
was
only
a
rookie
at
the
time
and
on
his
birthday
too
but
all
the
blame
lies
with
him
starting
in
peewee
coaches
tell
players
never
to
make
a
crossice
pass
in
front
of
their
own
net
too
much
chance
of
having
it
intercepted
or
hitting
the
goaltender
or
whatever
and
to
the
people
who
say
that
smith
cost
the
oilers
the
series
i
can
only
say
that
he
certainly
didnt
cause
the
team
to
lose
the
other
three
games
there
was
no
reason
for
a
powerhouse
team
like
edmonton
to
be
tied
late
in
the
third
period
of
the
game
of
the
second
round
everybody
on
the
team
has
to
take
responsibility

being

at
thursday
night
the

watchers
at
the
arena
began
to
cheer
their
cheer
quickly
turned
into
a
roar
and
finally
the
sellout
crowd
of
rose
as
one
to
rock
the
old
barn
at
oakland
avenue
in
a
salute
to
the
playoffbound
blues
the
scoreboard
had
just
flashed
the
news
from
detroit
red
wings
stars
with
the
north
stars
loss
the
blues
officially
clinched
fourth
place
and
the
final
playoff
spot
in
the
norris
division
good
thing
because
the
blues
quit
playing
they
held
a
lead
over
tampa
bay
when
the
detroitminnesota
final
appeared
with
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
period
they
promptly
went
to
sleep
and
barely
held
on
for
a
victory
that
nearly
slipped
away
at
the
buzzer
tampas
bob
beers
tipped
in
a
pass
from
shawn

but
officiating
supervisor

and

judge
rich

ruled
that
the
shot
had
gone
into

net
after
time
had
expired
im
glad
i
didnt
see
it
go
in
at
the
end
blues
coach
bob
berry
said
if
the
goal
had
counted
hed
have
been
more
upset
than
he
was
by
the
blues
disappearance
in
the
final
minutes
holding
on
for
the
victory
and
making
the
playoffs
tempered
berrys
anger
it
wasnt
pretty
at
the
end
he
said
we
played
great
minutes
as
good
as
we
played
all
year
it
slipped
away
at
the
end
it
shouldnt
have
but
it
did
still
the
blues
won
prompting
another
ovation
from
the
crowd
at
games
end
despite
their
shoddy
effort
in
the
third
period
and
all
the
turmoil
this
season
the
blues
still
made
the
playoffs
theyll
meet
the
chicago
blackhawks
in
a
bestofseven
norris
division
semifinal
beginning
at
noon
sunday
at
chicago
stadium
the
blues
finished
the
regularseason
with
a
record
of
for
points
their
fourth
consecutive
season
minnesota
finished
three
points
behind
in
fifth
place
with
a
record
of
for
points
tampa
bay
which
played
spoiler
last
week
by
tying
the
blues
at
tampa
ended
its
first
season
with
a
record
of
for
points
the
poor
finish
cast
an
unnecessary
shadow
over
what
should
have
been
a
joyous
blues
locker
room
instead
the
mood
was
one
of
relief
and
some
disappointment
its
a
shame
we
let
down
said
kevin
miller
one
of
three
blues
to
score
two
goals
brendan
shanahan
and
bob
bassen
were
the
others
there
was
no
need
for
a
letdown
if
wed
have
kept
working
it
would
have
ended
and
everyone
would
be
happy
instead
a
lot
of
players
were
happy
just
to
make
the
playoffs
we
won
and
thats
all
that
matters
said
brett
hull
scoreless
and
for
the
night
once
we
got
up
it
was
really
tough
to
play
some
players
didnt
have
a
problem
just
because
the
score
was
announced
our
line
didnt
quit
said
rich
sutter
who
played
with
bassen
and
miller
we
still
had
a
game
to
play
you
cant
allow
five
goals
like
we
did
thats
not
right
it
was
disappointing
to
see
what
was
going
on
bassen
was
almost
frantic
on
the
bench
because
of
the
blues
effort
somehow
he
missed
the
announcement
of
minnesotas
loss
i
didnt
know
it
was
final
he
said
i
was
kind
of
looking
around
on
the
bench
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
final
for
some
reason
were
in
the
playoffs
and
thats
great
but
its
a
little
disappointing
to
play
like
we
did
at
the
end
the
letdown
was
precisely
the
reason
that
berry
had
instructed
the
scoreboard
operators
to
keep
the
minnesotadetroit
score
off
of
the
board
the
score
showed
until
it
first
popped
up
with
detroit
leading
in
the
third
period
the
blues
already
led
at
the
time
i
told
them
i
didnt
want
to
see
the
score
i
didnt
want
to
know
the
score
berry
said
i
felt
we
had
to
win
the
game
and
thats
the
approach
we
took
if
minnesota
took
a
lead
berry
feared
the
pressure
of
having
to
win
might
bother
the
blues
if
detroit
led
he
worried
the
blues
might
quit
until
the
announcement
the
blues
played
splendidly
shanahan
got
the
crowd
going
at
of
the
first
period
scoring
his
of
the
season
then
miller
and
bassen
took
charge
late
in
the
period
with
the
teams
playing
four
on
four
miller
broke
in
on
left
wing
deked
defenseman
roman
hamrlik
and
beat
former
blues
goalie
pat
jablonski
with
the
rebound
of
his
own
shot
with
seconds
remaining
in
the
period
then
just
seconds
later
bassen
rifled
a
long
slap
shot
past
jablonski
after
defenseman
rick
zombo
intercepted
a
tampa
pass
in
the
neutral
zone
bassen
made
it
just
seconds
into
the
second
period
scoring
on
the
rebound
of
bret
hedicans
shot
the
goal
gave
him
his
first
twogoal
game
of
the
season
and
reminded
him
of
a
special
friend
last
year
bassen
befriended
young
oliver
mulvihill
who
died
of
a
rare
form
of
cancer
at
age
on
feb
i
was
thinking
of
my
buddy
oliver
bassen
said
hes
in
heaven
now
and
i
know
he
was
watching
i
know
hes
happy
miller
increased
the
blues
lead
to
on
a
breakaway
goal
set
up
by
zombo
at
then
steve
maltais
broke
curtis
josephs
shutout
just
seconds
later
making
it
less
than
a
minute
after
the
north

final
was
announced
tim
bergland
scored
and
cut
the
lead
to
but
shanahan
scored
his
converting
a
pass
from
nelson
emerson
with
seconds
remaining
in
the
second
period
then
it
was
all
lightning
adam
creighton
scored
seconds
into
the
third
period
prompting
berry
to
rest
the
overworked
joseph
guy
hebert
allowed
goals
to
shawn
chambers
and
danton
cole
in
a
span
of
midway
through
the
third

re
european

how
long
would
they
support
teams
that
are
run
on
rangerbased
corporate
thinking
i
use
the
term
lightly
we
dont
need
a

product
because
these
duffuses
in
nyc
would
fill
the
arena
for
ottawas
record
every
haha
sorry
had
ta
say
it
look
how
long
the
maple
leafs
and
nordiques
used
similar
logic
not
that
they
fielded
bad
teams
solely
to
field
bad
teams
but
the
maple
leafs
and
a
certain
dead
man
who
was
in
charge
were
one
of
the
cheapest
teams
in
the
history
of
the
sport
guess
what
they
were
immensely
popular
at
the
gate
the
nordiques
have
also
done
well
for
a
team
that
had
missed
the
playoffs
so
many
years
in
a
row
look
at
british
or
any
european
soccer
as
an
example
they
never
have
fan
problems
ha
such
humor
they
have
major
fan
problems
namely
that
on
occasion
some
of
them
dont
make
it
home
from
the
match
the
soccer
fans
tend
to
be
fanatical
much
like
the
montreal
fans
who
firebomb
the
players
and
coaches
houses
when
they

well

that

the

let
toronto

detroit
beat
the

chicago
sweeps

that
just
makes
it
easier
in
the
second

with
all
the
rest
they
will
get
and
tordet
getting
none
for
the
conf
champ
they
will
have
a
hard
time
versus
the
division
but
that
div
will
be
pretty
battered
also
so
the
advantage
goes
to
the
hawks
again
then
bring
pitt
and
sure
the
hawks
will
probably
lose
but
its
better
to
get
that
far
and
lose
than
to
not
go
brian
hopefully
a
miracle
ok
not
quite
a
miracle
but
close
will
occur
and
pittsburgh
will
be
elminated
prior
to
the
finals
if
they
make
it
again
they
will
probably
keep

francis

this
is
not

anything

from
jaro
who
had
a
decent
year
although
it
didnt
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
some
bowman
tended
to
overplay
francis
at
times
because
he
is
a
bowmanstyle
player
he
plays
hard
at
all
times
doesnt
disregard
his
defensive
responsibilities
and
is
a
good
leader
bowman
rewarded
him
be
increasing
his
ice
time
jagr
can
be
very
arrogant
and
juvenile
and
display
a
me
first
attitude
this
rubbed
bowman
the
wrong
way
and
caused
him
to
lose
some
ice
time
throughout
the
year
francis
consistently
recieved
more
ice

than
jagr
althouhg
i
have
never
seen
stats
on

i
am
pretty
sure
that
jagr
had
more
points
per
minute
played
that
francis
when
you
add
to
that
jagrs
better
rating
i
think
it
becomes
evident
that

had

that

my
vote
goes
to
john
vanbiesbrouck
his
mask
has
a
skyline
of
new
york
city
and
on
the
sides
there
are
a
bunch
of
bees
beezer
it
looks
really
sharp
funny
you
should
mention
this
one
time
on
hnic
don
cherry
pointed
out
vanbiesbroucks
mask
he
hated
it
i
think
he
said
something
to
the
effect
of
you
see
he
was
great
last
year
now
he
goes
out
and
gets
that
dopey
mask
and
he
cant
stop
a
beachball
you
may
or
may
not
take
cherry
seriously
at
all
but
i
cracked
up
when
i
heard
it
i
think
ed
belfour
has
the
current
best
mask
in
the
nhl
btw
i
also
like
moogs
and
ill
give
fuhrs
new
one
an
honourable
mention
although
i
havent
seen
it
closely
yet
it
looked
good
from
a
distance
whats
also
neat
is
chevaldaes
in
detroit
they
call
him
chevy
so
he
has
two
checkered
flags
painted
at
the
top

let
me
give
my
two
cents
worth
in
this
whole
thing
i
am
very
sick
of
pittsburg
fansand
they
are
my
second
favorite
team
talk
about
how
why
cant
bruins
forget
about
ulf
samuelsson
when
we
have
forgotten
all
about
adam
graves
beside
the
obvious
fact
that
lemeuixs
career
was
never
endangered
by
graves
slash
while
neely
is
still
bother
by
his
injury
i
think
the
most
important
reason
is
adam
graves
has
played
clean
hockey
ever
since
while
ulf
samulesson
continues
to
play
dirtyyes
trying
to
hit
a
player
where
hes
injured
is
dirty
fans
have
can
forget
about
one
dirty
play
but
how
can
you
forget
about
ulf
samulesson
when
everynight
when
i
watch
hockey
high
lights
i
get
reminded
of
how
dirty
he
is
hitting
a
player
when
hes
injured
is
dirty
can
you
explain
this
statement
do
you
mean
a
player
who
was
just
injured
on
the
ice
or
do
you
mean
a
player
who
is
playing
hurt
if
a
player
is
hurt
he
should
not
bother
playing
because
i
dont
belive
any
player
should
be
let
up
on
just
because
they
are
playing
hurt
im
not
an
ulf
fan
but
at
least
i
can
spot
the
fact
he
is
like
calgarys
theoren
fleury
in
the
respect
that
part
of
his
game
is
to
really
piss
other
players
off
as
thats
part
of
his
job
but
he
lacks
ulfs
size
i
am
an
ulf
and
pgh
fan
and
what
pisses
me
off
about
the
whole
adam
graves
ulf
samuesson
debate
is
that
ulf
plays
hardhitting
hockey
nothing
wrong
with
that
while
graves
does
what
he
does
when
the
only
way
to
win
a
game
is
to
intentionally
hurt
someone
which
bites
players
that
really
piss
me
off
are
the
ones
who
insist
on
hitting
from
behind
or
try
to
go
for
the
knees
to
injure
the
players
this
kind
of
garbage
has
got
to
go
i
would
really
like
to
see
muni
get
pasted
as
he
is
one
of
the
worst
offenders
i
thought
they
had
instituted
all
kinds
of
new
rules
this
season
to
stop
crap
like
that
is
it
just
me
or
does
the
officiating
just
still
stink
to
high
heaven
imho
if
they
could
get
rid
of
the
existing
refs
and
institute
a
new
system
with
more
than
one
ref
on
the
ice
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
troublemakers
then
a
lot
of
these
things
would
stop
and
then
the
game
would
be
ruled
by
the

whichever
you
prefer
lost
to

by
a
score
of
the

goals

ulf
dahlen

netted
two
including
the
final
one
in
franchise
history
with
less
than
a
minute
to
play
this
is
very
sad
indeed
my
condolences
to
the
minnesota
fans
who
are
losing
their
team
i
fear
that
within
the
next
decade
or
so
the
only
professional
sports
team
left
in
pittsburgh
will
be
the

anyone
got

paul

no

he

i

in

it

so
maybe
espn
will
grab
their
coverage
i
dont

as
for
the

ottawa
picks
which
means
it
is
almost
that
alexander
daigle
will
go
hell
either
stay
or
be
traded
in
montreal
or
quebec
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championships
daigle
didnt
show
this
for
his
junior
team
san
jose
will
then
get
kariya
tampa
bay
will
either
go
for
a
russian
kozlov
i
think
thats
it
or
a

rob

probably
spelt
the
last

wrong

i
dont

whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his

whether
hes
a

altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
for
those
of
you
who
complain
about
don

wonder
why
he
is
popular
the
reply
is
dick
vitale
and
john
madden
and
bobby
knight
and
joe
garagiola
and
howard
cosell
john
madden
picks
gary
clark
of

for

team
a
lot
over
much
better

much
the

reasons
cherry
sings
the
praises

doug
gilmoura
little
guy
with
heartyet
one
doesnt
see
a
string
of
american
posts
saying
that
john
madden
has
lost
his
marbles
dick
vitale
is
always
promoting
this
kid
from
this
high
school
or
that
college
with
outrageous
statements
why
should
americans
expect
that
canada
would
not
have
such
characters
in
relation
to
our
greatest
passionwhich
is
hockey
canadians
are
very
similar
to
americansculturally
our
sports
are
just
hockey
and
curling
whereas
with
americans
it
is
footballbasketballbaseball
and
bowling
gerald
id
like
to
add
that
i
think
canadian
hockey
fans
like
don
because
his
kind
of
hockey
the
hockey
he
promotes
in
his
tv
appearances
is
the
kind
that
they
think
used
to
get
played
in
the
old
team
nhl
so
theres
a
kind
of
nostagia
for
the
old
days
before
expansion
the
soviet
series
gretzky
and
even
bobby
orr
when
guys
werent
afraid
to
take
a
hit
nobody
floated
and
defensemen
played
defence
who
cares
that
that
probably
never
really
existed
the
myth
is
still
around
in
canada
and
all
the
european
in
fluence
on
the
game
has
diminished
it
in
some
peoples
eyes
personally
id
like
to
add
before
i
get
flamed
i
love
the
fastpaced
european
game
and
think
don
cherry
is
a
bit
of
an

having

in

covered

between
and
the

with
pim
not

invisible
he
then
was
sent
down
to
kansas
city
walked
out
from
there
and
was
suspended
and
later
reinstated
when
it
was
revealed
that
he
was
injured
he
then
promptly
disappeared
from
the
watching
eyes
of
shark
bytes
as
the
mailing
list
is
now
known
to
sharks
officials
faithful
and
neither
the
sharks
nor
we
miss
him
well
having
gotten
to
a
chance
to
talk
to
him
a
few
times
this
isnt
quite
accurate
he
injured
his
back
a
disk
injury
and
did
one
stupid
thing
which
was
to
hide
it
from
the
sharks
and
he
tried
to
play
through
it
because
he
knew
he
was
on
the
bubble
the
sharks
then
sent
him
to
kc
at
which
point
he
disclosed
the
injury
since
he
didnt
disclose
it
the
sharks
and
he
disagreed
about
the
responsibility
and
he
was
suspended
for
not
reporting
that
was
eventually
worked
out
the
sharks
reinstated
him
as
injured
and
put
him
into
therapy
and
when
he
was
able
to
play
then
shipped
him
down
to
kc
he
fully
expects
to
play
in
the
nhl
again
although
clearly
not
with
the
sharks
hiding
injuries
is
a
stupid
nono
beyond
just
a
nono
very
nice
guy
always
hustled
his
butt
off
he
disappeared
because
he
was
hurt
i
expect
hell
surface
with
another
team
at
some
point
probably
another
expansion
team
but
is
likely
to
be
a
bubble
player
for
the
rest
of
his
career
has
a
good
work
ethic
and
is
good
at
getting
other
players
motivated
unfortunately
he
played
himself
out
of

with
a
bad
judgement
call
john
carter
season
acquired

from
boston
grade
i
bb
he
is
very
unlikely
to
be
back
next
season
always
gave
best
work
ethic
on
the
club
except
maybe
kisio
but
hustle
isnt
always
enough
his
future
with
the
sharks
was
made
clear
to
me
one
night
against
the
flames
when
he
went
behind
the
crease
and
tried
to
hold
joel
otto
against
the
board
he
literally
had
one
arm
around
ottos
neck
and
another
wrapped
around
ottos
stick
arm
otto
casually
turned
around
and
fed
the
puck
in
front
of
the
crease
for
a
goal
as
though
carter
wasnt
there
hustle
can
only
cover
size
so
far
the
sharks
have
told
me
point
blank
that
hes
gone
for
good
ditto
hubie
mcdonough
he
was
one
of
the
favorites
of
the
staff

as
one
said
to

you
have
to
make
room
for
the
kids
carter
in
fact
refused
to
report
to
kc
and
has
been
suspended
by
the

might

any
more
than
the
games
he
played
this

at

from
the
games
i
saw
him
in
he
was
outmatched
and
looked
fairly
lost
on

think
he
shows
potential
but
i
didnt
think
he
was
quite
ready
to
make
the
jump
to
the
nhl
he
should
be
a
solid
contender
for

next

still

does
its
a
shame
people
say
that
cheap
shots
and
drawing
penalties
by
fake
ing
is
part
of
the

i
say
bullsht
if
he

tried
some
like
that
on

would
have

wouldnt

what

theres

if

do
theyre

did
you
really
expect
toronto
to
go
anywhere
really
detroit
is
a
very
disciplined
team
theres
a
lot
of
europeans
in
detroit
which
would
make
the
game
fast
so
toronto
would
have
to
slow
the
game
down
which
means
drawing
penalties
as
a
last
resort
anyway
toronto
will
be
a
good
team
as
soon
as
they
get
more
good
players
toronto
is
just
an
average
team
detroit
isnt
ballard
screwed
toronto
when
he
was
owner
everyone
knows
that
and
its
going
to
take
time
for
toronto
to

i
watched

germanyczechs
in

i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every
possible
sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
i
can
understand
your
anger
about
the
german
audience
i
mean
it
was
the
finnish
team
they
played
and
they
were
taking
advantage
of
the
ridiculous
penalties
the
canadien
ref
called
in
the
last
period
the
germans
got
a
match
penalty
and
a
minutes
misconduct
for
practically
nothing
and
seconds
after
that
the
german
goalie
got
two
minutes
for
delay
of
game
for
a
shot
that
was
deflected
and
went
into
the
crowd
the
resulting
skating
advantage
lead
to
the
deciding
goal
at
a
point
when
the
germans
were
starting
to
come
up
strong
i
am
also
sick
of
the
nationalism
that
is
going
on
in
german
sports
events
if
you
watch
for
example
a
tennis
davis
cup
match
the
players
are
often
not
able
to
play
for
minutes
because
the
crowd
is
so
obnoxious
but
i
have
to
admit
that
this
kind
of
nationalism
is
as
strong
or
even
stronger
in
most
other
countries
you
should
go
to
the
us
and
watch
the
way
they
present
the
olympics
on
television
or
the
soccer
crowds
in
england
or
the
finnish
spectators
at
nordic
skiing
events
i
mean
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
all
this
nationalism
all
over
the
world
and
i
would
rather
see
the
best
teamplayer
win
and
get
cheared
at
i
do
not
mind
if
my
favorite
team
looses
to
somebody
that
is
better
or
plays
more
attractive
and
i
have
to
admit
that
in
most
sports
the
german
national
site
is
not
my
favorite
team
to
watch
the
german
soccer
team
is
boring
to
watch
for
example
but
reading
the
above
posting
i
think
that
you
are
on
the
same
level
as
these
crowds
you
are
criticizing
it
is
easy
to
talk
of
nearly
all
germans
as
nazis
and
nationalists
thats
the
kind
of
propaganda
that
all
ultraconservative
people
use
against
germany
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
great
danger
of
rearising
nationalism
in
germany
but
from
my
experience
most
of
the
people
at
least
of
the
people
that
i
know
also
regard
this
as
a
big
threat
and
are
trying
to
demonstrate
this
attitude
now
why
cant
we
just
look
at
people
as
human
beeings
and
not
try
to
put
them
into
drawers
corresponding
to
their
nationality
eg
all
russians
are
communists
all
americans
are
capitalists
all
germans
are
nazis
all
fins
are
hanging
around
beeing
drunk
on
ferries
in
my
opinion
your
comment
shows
the
narrowness
of
your
mind
and
that
you
dont
seem
to
be
different
from
the
nazis
you
are

by

daily

barry
melroses
decision
to
stick
robb
stauber
in
the
stands
rather
than
in
the
crease
or
even
on
the
bench
for
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
does
not
sit
well
with
the
rookie
goaltender
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
the
team
at
the
most
crucial
time
of
the
year
the
most
fun
time
of
the
year
and
im
not
stauber
said
with
some
emotion
monday
i
think
i
have
worked
hard
enough
for
that
stauber
said
he
accepts
melroses
choice
of
kelly
hrudey
as
the
teams
top
goalie
in
their
playoff
series
with
the
calgary
flames
hrudey
made
saves
in
sundays
opening
victory
but
stauber
clearly
is
upset
with
his
sudden
status
as
the
no
man
behind
rick
knickle
stauber
had
a
record
and
goalsagainst
average
down
the
stretch
in
the
regular
season
and
nearly
wrestled
the
no
job
from
hrudey
knickle
he
won
of
decisions
but
had
a
bloated
average
twice
was
yanked
from
games
once
for
stomach
cramps
and
hasnt
played
since
march
yet
when
the
series
resumes
wednesday
knickle
will
serve
as
hrudeys
backup
again
and
stauber
will
have
to
satisfy
his
playoff
hunger
by
munching
on
olympic
saddledome
popcorn
if
im
supposedly
close
to
being
the
starter
or
could
have
been
the
starteri
dropped
too
what
happened
to
no
stauber
wondered
not
that
id
be
happy
with
no
but
i
feel
i
should
at
least
be
a
part
of
this
team
in
the
playoffs
perhaps
stauber
eventually
will
get
his
chance
but
melrose
apparently
is
not
convinced
the
old
is
capable
of
handling
playoff
pressure
while
insisting
he
is
the
kings
goalie
of
the
future
melrose
said
stauber
flubbed
all
four
of
the
big
games
he
was
asked
to
win
this
season
they
were
according
to
melrose
a
loss
to
san
jose
on
dec
an
loss
to
the
new
york
rangers
on
jan
a
tie
with
detroit
on
feb
an
loss
to
vancouver
on
thursday
four
times
this
season
robb
could
have
emerged
as
the
elite
goalie
he
could
have
taken
it
away
from
kelly
hrudey
and
he
didnt
do
it
melrose
said
an
elite
goaltender
has
to
carry
the
ball
when
you
give
it
to
him
the
mark
of
a
great
goalie
is
that
he
isnt
satisfied
to
be
a
backup
im
not
blaming
robb
for
the
losses
but
if
youre
going
to
be
no
youve
got
to
be
able
to
walk
your
talk
youve
got
to
be
able
to
play
when
everything
is
on
the
line
robb
stauber
has
a
great
deal
of
ability
but
maybe
i
expect
more
from
him
than
he
does
ouch
that
remark
stung
stauber
he
began
the
season
struggled
when
the
team
hit
a
midseason
slump
didnt
play
for
a
month
after
knickle
was
signed
off
the
san
diego
gulls
roster
then
came
on
at
the
end
i
expect
more
from
myself
than
anybody
including
barry
melrose
said
stauber
a
threeyear
star
at
the
university
of
minnesota
who
left
school
in
only
to
have
his
development
hampered
by
a
string
of
serious
injuries
what
ive
been
through
the
last
four
years
two
knee
operations
a
herniated
disk
in
my
back
shoulder
surgery
what
more
can
i
go
through
i
obviously
do
expect
a
lot
from
myself
otherwise
i
wouldnt
be
here
anybody
who
would
disagree
with
that
doesnt
know
me
im
not
saying
barry
doesnt
know
me
but
dont
say
ive
been
without
expectations
if
anything
im
a
perfectionist
stauber
acknowledged
he
played
poorly
in
the
four
games
melrose
mentioned
but
even
though
i
didnt
play
well
i
get
knocked
down
from
maybe
on
to
three
its
a
bit
of
a
jump
he
said
youre
almost
no
or
if
you
play
a
good
game
youre
no
and
if
you
dont
youre
no
why
does
jack
nicklaus
shoot
a
and
then
a
can
you
explain
that
thats
what
barry
wanted
me
to
explain
to
him
why
i
didnt
come
through
when
he
counted
on
me
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
its
a
sport
ill
be
there
melroses
goalie
of
the
future
statement
doesnt
mean
much
to
stauber
before
you
know
it
ill
be
and
there
will
be

stopped

in

game
the
first
period
started
with
a
give
away
from
a
canadian
defenseman
and
rundqvist
came
in
alone
on
ranford
but
couldnt
put
the
puck
over
a
sliding
ranford
later
on
kevin
dineen
had
a
great
opportunity
but
soderstrom
played
very
well
too
stefan
nilsson
had
a
couple
of
great
dekes
and
set
up
jan
larsson
but
again
ranford
came
up
big
period
ended
scoreless
but
the
edge
to
sweden
in
creating
more
opportunities
second
period
action
saw
tommy
soderstrom
making
a
great
save
mark
recchi
made
a
backhanded
cross
ice
pass
to
lindros
eric
one
timed
the
puck
but
soderstrom
was
there
to
make
a
glove
hand
save
at
the
mark
canada
started
applying
pressure
on
the
swedes
sandersondineenbrindamour
worked
hard
and
kept
the
puck
in
the
swedes
zone
dineen
gave
the
puck
to
sanderson
who
skated
around
a
screened
swedish
defenseman
came
in
on
soderstrom
and
made
a
wrist
shot
that
went
it
by
soderstroms
far
post
canada
the
swedes
picked
up
their
game
after
that
and
peter
forsberg
had
a
shot
that
hit
ranfords
post
the
inside
went
parallel
to
the
goal
line
and
out
then
gartner
got
a
penalty
and
the
swedes
a
power
play
jan
larsson
took
a
shot
from
the
slot
ranford
gave
a
rebound
to
larsson
who
saw
juhlin
by
the
far
post
passed
the
puck
and
ranford
was
beat
third
period
started
as
the
other
periods
swedes
having
most
of
the
pressure
but
the
canadians
always
dangerous
once
they
were
close
to
the
swede
goal
at
canada
created
some
great
chances
and
arto
blomsten
was
forced
to
cover
the
puck
in
the
swede
goal
crease
since
soderstrom
lost
sight
of
it
that
resulted
in
a
penalty
shot
since
a
defenseman
cant
cover
the
puck
in
the
goal
crease
geoff
sanderson
took
the
penalty
shot
his
first
ever
he
explained
afterwards
and
he
put
it
low
on
soderstroms
stick
side
close
to
the
post
excellent
penalty
shot
to
give
canada
a
go
ahead
goal
canada
increased
the
lead
on
a
very
suspect
offside
gartner
volleyed
a
bouncing
puck
past
soderstrom
to
make
it
the
swedes
ran
out
of
gas
then
and
couldnt
produce
as
good
scoring
chances
as
they
had
for
periods
the
goal
came
with
only
second
left
rod
brindamour
scoring
on
a
rebound
from
soderstrom
where
the
swedish
defense
already
had
their
minds
in
the
dressing
room
a
very
good
game
the
best
in
the
wc
so
far
with
both
goalies
playing
great
soderstrom
best
player
in
sweden
but
ranford
even
played
better
than
soderstrom
that
tells
you
something
about
ranford
probably
the
best
goalie
in
the
world
were
some
comments
after
the
game
canada
played
a
very
disciplined
defense
ranford
pointed
out
that
it
is
easy
to
play
well
with
a
good
defense
lindros
played
a
lot
and
played
well
sanderson
naturally

swedish

after

partly
because

put

tonight
with

all

have
now
seen
the
power
of
the
mighty

offense
torontos
defense
in
no
match
for
the
wing
offense
as
for
the
defense
probert
kennedey
and
primeau
came
out
did
they
move
probert
back
to
defense
why
did
i
see
him
parking
his
ass
in
front
of
potvin
all
night
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
discipline
probert
if
the
leafs
want
to
win
the
series
perhaps
a
fresh
clark
should
hit
the
ice
at
the

of
a
long

him

whats
going
on
the
russians
and
the
czechs
are
unable
to
beat
easy
opponents
and
the
swedes
beat
austria
only
its
the
openinggame
effect
maybe
pros
arrive
late
nervousness
for
rookie
wc
players
and
problems
to
get
the
lines
clicking
may
make
things
hard
to
get
it
going
against
these
worse
nations
id
guess
that
the
better
team
you
face
in
the
opening
game
the
better
it
is
since
the
chances
of
an
upset
are
greater
then
some
other
reasons
why
the
worse
teams
are
so
tough
to
beat
was
presented
by
hans
virus
lindberg
former
coach
in
switzerland
the
worse
teams
referring
to
france
switzerland
austria
italy
etc
have
now
usually
world
class
goalies
their
defensive
play
have
become
much
more
disciplined
they
take
much
less
unnecessary
penalties
they
use
four
lines
which
makes
it
harder
to
make
them
run
out
of
gas
the
ice
quality
in
the
german
wc
rinks
is
poor
the
only
convincing
winner
was
germany
wierd
another
weird
thing
was
that
the

played

reminds

sometimes
speaking

that
trade
i
also
wish

a

vincent

take

apparently
i
have
no
idea
why
demers
is
playing
denis
savard
on
the
checking
line
with
carbonneau
savard
is
skating
well
and
is
one
of
the
only
dangerous
canadiens
in
quebecs
zone
with
the
puck
too
bad
nobody
is

most
of
the
time
do
you
also
notice
that
in
the
defensive
zone
not
a
single
nordique
gets
knocked
down
its
disgusting
we
also
have
lebeau
getting
pasted
at
centre
ice
by
wolaninn
with
no
reply
from
the
team
except
to
yell
for
a
penalty
dammit
denis
savard
threw
the
best
only
montreal
hit
of
the
night
when
he
knocked
sundin
offbalance
when
denis
savard
is
your
teams
enforcer
theres
big
trouble
someplace
hextall
made
some
good
saves
but
really
this
one
was
lost
in
first
period
when
nords
scored
could
have
had
plus
another
in
aside
from
that
second
goal
roy
did
stand
on
his
head
the
third
period
at
least
provided
something
to
look
forward
to
habs
won
the
period
imo
and
i
guess
somebody
finally
came
along
to
smack
them
a
couple
of
times
in
the
second
intermission
to
remind
them
that
a

they
play

also

always

so
in

words
if
roussel
shuts
out
the
sharks
and
soderstrom
shuts
out
the
penguins
thats
immaterial
because
it
was
the
coaches
decision
come
on
joe
think
about
what
youre
saying
who
they
played
is
very
significant
why
they
played
them
is
whats
irrelevent
a
low
gaa
against
good
teams
is
better
than
a
low
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
a
low
gaa
is
better
then
a
higher
gaa
a
low
gaa
against
good
teams
is
much
much
better
than
a
higher
gaa
against
bad
teams
in
the
context
of
comparing
two
goaltenders
lets
start
over
im
not
arguing
about
who
is
the
better
goaltender
id
take
soderstrom
right
now
what
i
am
saying
is
that
roussel
can
be
a
netminder
the
gaa
difference
is
less
than
half
a
goal
per
game
less
than
that
after
last
night
their
save
percentages
are
close
and
their
records
are
similar
and
with
that
i
just
dont
see
how
you
can
label
roussel
as
the
most
disappointing
player
on
the
flyers
this
season
you
say
soderstrom
played
against
better
competition
that
may
very
well
be
but
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
how
roussel
would
have
performed
in
those
games
besides
against
the
better
scoring
teams
like
pittsburgh
the
defense
is
more
keyed
up
than
they
are
against
san
jose
the
same
for
roussel
in
the
ranger
game
two
real
scoring
chances
one
he
made
a
great
play
the
other
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
from
the
other
player
if
you
were
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
you
have
very
little
to
go
by
but
im
not
just
judging
roussel
on
that
game
alone
ive
seen
him
play
for
the
past
two
seasons
in
philly
and
before
that
in
hershey
its
just
my
opinion
but
i
think
hes
got
what
it
takes
of
course
i
thought
that
about
mark
laforest
too
but
i
never
did
about
wendell
young
so
im
batting
in
judging
hershey
talent
since
the
hextallera
as
for
the
rangers
game
you
can
say
he
was
saved
by
a
mistake
by
the
offensive
player
if
you
like
but
rou
had
his
leg
in
position
to
make
the
save
if
he
didnt
it
wouldnt
have
mattered
if
the
rangers
player
didnt
get
the
puck
up
or
not
it
would
have
been
a
goal
on
a
breakaway
thats
what
the
goalie
wants
to
do
take
away
as
much
as
possible
and
force
the
shooter
to
beat
him
but
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
tie
against
the
habs
you
saw
a
goalie
stand
on
his
head
to
get
that
shutout
that
was
a
goalie
in
action
roussel
doesnt
have
a
game
like
that
in
him
i
seem
to
remember
roussel
doing
an
excellent
job
against
pittsurgh
on
opening
night
to
give
the
flyers
a
tie
against
the
twotime
defending
champs
and
not
to
take
anything
away
from
soderstrom
because
he
was
senational
in
that
game
agains
the
habs
but
you
cant
tell
me
that
a
montreal
player
had
an
open
net
to
shoot
at
some
point
during
that
game
and
just
flat
out
missed
it
mistakes
both
on
offense
and
defense
are
part
of
the
game
or
thered
never
be
shutouts
anyway
im
happy
the
flyers
have
both
soderstrom
and
roussel
and
im
not
going
to
argue
about
it
anymore
besides
with
the
current
winning
streak
and
expectations
soaring
for
next
year
i
dont
want
to
piss
you
off
to
the

it

up

doesnt

is

jagr
can
be

this
rubbed

you

not
that

actually
what

that

jagr

it
is
the
most

hockey

available
until
the
nhl
publishes
a
more
useful
quantifiable
statistic
including
ice

and
some
measure
of
its
quality
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situations
like
protecting
a

in

is
he

of

the
biggest
advantage
that
kids
from

have
is
the
availability
of
ice
in
the
san
jose
area
we
have
a
population
of
and
that
population
is
served
by
ice
arenas
in
contrast
kamloops
british

has
a
population
of
about
and
has
rinks
there
are
also
myriad
ponds
pools
etc
that
freeze
in

down
here
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
bicycle
up
there
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
pair
of
skates
and
before
you
say
what
does
he
know
hes
from
california
let
me
say
that
i
was
born
and
raised
in
trail
british
columbia
a
town
of
about
with
lots
of
ice
in
the
winter
my
father
did
radio
play
by
play
for
the
local
team
the
trail
smokeaters
who
by
the
way
were
the
last
canadian
team
to
win
the
world
championship
back
in
i
was
on
skates
almost
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
and
have
been
playing
recreational
hockey
for
about
years
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
a
hockey
league
in
the
inner
city
the
insurance
alone
is
a
big
enough
barrier
the
inner
city
isnt
the
only
place
that
is
poor
i
think
the
biggest
barrier
to
hockey
in
the
inner
city
is
no
ice
to
play
on
lack
of
ice
is
a
big
factor
but
costs
is
a
bigger
factor
both
my
kids
play
for
the
santa
clara
valley
hockey
association
and
this
season
which
just
ended
cost
me
per
kid
for
membership
in
hockey
usa
plus
per
kid
for
club
dues
the
hockey
usa
fees
cover
excess
medical
insurance
and
the
club
dues
cover
ice
time
officials
trophies
etc
other
areas
have
similar
fees
unless
the
city
government
subsidises
some
of
the
costs
as
stockton
does
by
the
way
most
ice
arenas
are
located
in
what
could
be
called
the
inner
city
areas
eastridge
and
vallco
are
exceptions
redwood
citys
rink
is
in
an
industrial
area
on

rd
near

is
near
ashby
and
martin

king

of
the
street
fresnos
is
out
on

edge

just
west
of

rosas
is
a
nice
rink
but
its
in
an
older
section
of
town
dublins
is
outside
of
town
off
most
of
the
rinks
are
old
and
expensive
to
run
with
huge
electric
bills
and
insurance
premiums
if
you
want
to
buy
ice
time
expect
to
pay
around
per
hour
at
any
of
these
rinks
some
of
them
give
you
a
minute
hour
for
your
money
others
give
you
a

and
include

low
is
purely
a

the
fact

can
chip

a

nhl

after
reading
some
of
the
reports
of
possible
nhl
moves
to
milwaukee
or
that
milwaukee
should
have
an
nhl
team
i
thought
id
pass
along
a
story
i
heard
recently
this
is
second
hand
so
i
dont
know
how
true
it
is

i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
either
bradley

in

is
home
to
the
milwaukee
admirals
minor
leauge

team
the
owner
of
the
admirals
sorry
i
cant
remember
his
name
either
owns
or
at
least
shelled
out
the
majority
of
the
funds
to
build
the
bradley
center
supposedly
he
was
approached
by
the
nhl
about
an
expansion
franchise
but
turned
it
down
because
he
thought
the
franchise
fee
of
million
was
too
high
like
i
said
i
dont
know
whether
this
story
is
true
or
just
a
rumor
but
if
its
true
dont
look
for
an
nhl
team
in
milwaukee
anytime
soon
the
admirals
arent
going
to
be
forced
out
of
the
building
and
you
wont
see
an
nhl
club
and
a
minor

club
in
the

even

the

that
our

the

there
was

again
we

well
the
jettison
for
youth
fast
strategy
was
his
also
in

it
didnt
work
all
that
well
but
i
think
it
was
more
because
it
left
the
sharks
on
a
tightrope
without
a
net
not
that
it
was
inherently
flawed
it
was
the
injuries
that
caused
us
to
fall
lets
say
that
in
the
view
of
the
sharks
upper
management
the
attempt
to
trade
kisio
was
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
to
fire
feirerra
from
all
indications
it
wasnt
the
major
factor
but
the
last
straw
there
were
personality
conflicts
among
shark
management
and
disagreements
over
how
personnel
were
going
to
be
handled
not
just
who
was
being
traded
vs
kept
but
who
was
being
sent
to
kc
what
ferriera
did
if
rumors
are
right
was
not
always
what
the
folks
behind
the
bench
wanted
or
needed
im
inclined
to
take
exactly
the
opposite
view
they
should
have
kept
himhes
obviously
the
luckiest
man
in
hockey
i
think
if
theyd
kept
ferriera
they
would
have
lost
some
of
their
other
management
staff
depending
on
which
sources
you
trust
we
might
have
lost
grillo
and
lombardi
and
murdoch
over
the
summer
frankly
i
want
to
keep
those
three
we
may
well
ahve
also
lost
kingston
which
of
course
is
now
a
moot
point
the
sharks
have
been
building
an
organizational
staff
that
is
highly
consensual
and
cooperative
ferriera
wanted
to
run
things
his
way
there
were
conflicts
ferriera
lost
that
says
nothing
about
his
skills
or
accomplishments
at
that
level
a
lot
is
personality
and
politics
i
think
he
did
some
good
things
for
the
sharks
but
that
he
never
fit
in
as
a
shark
person
i
hope
he
succeeds
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
down
in
anaheim
too
because
itll
be
good
for
hockey
but
i
want
the

to
be

that

as
that
could
have

the
best

of

i
think
boston
will
come
out
smoking
in
the
next
two
games
and
that
buffalo
will
end
the

in
game
six
back
in

and
say
how
about
those

they
are
up

letcha
know
that
being
desperate
for
news
on
the
game
i
tried
to
get
wjr
am
on
my
walkman
and
succeeded
it
was
at
night
about
reception
got
better
as
it
got
you
can
get
wjr
a
long
way
away
the
problem
is
that
because
of
those
well
known
and
beloved
contractual
obligations
wjr
will
be
doing
tiger
baseball
instead
of
the
wings
playoff
games
for
probably
half
the
games
the
wings
could
play
for
this
series
i
know
tonights
game
and
i
believe
games
and
if
necessay
will
be
bumped
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next
president
a
new

of
things
to
worry
about
im
getting

reading
the

yes

can

all
those

finally
taking
their

sweaters
out
of
the
moth
balls
and
proudly
wearing
them
after
years
of
playoff
frustration
and
being
up
games
to
nil
i
guess
it
is
a
pretty
good
bet
but
there
has
not
been
a
team
that
has
come
back
from
an
deficit
since
could
this
be
the

dont
throw
out
the

news

playoff
thoughts
i
wrote
i
feel
the
jury
is
still
out
on
tim
cheveldae
as
a
playoff
goalie
he
was
average
in
his
first
playoffs
last
year
he
had
a
horrible
start
but
played
great
the
last
ten
games
after
he
was
benched
his
gaa
even
with
the
horrible
start
was
last
year
this
year
i
think
hes
going
to
play
very
well
he
has
to
if
detroit
is
going
to
win
the
cup
he
wasnt
sharp
in
game
but
he
didnt
have
to
be
i
thought
he
looked
pretty
good
yesterday
charles
hubbert
writes
great
write
up
of
the
wingstoronto
series
thus
far
i
agree
with
just
about
everything
that
you
said
but
chevy
shouldnt
have
let
the
shot
from
the
right
point
in
first
goal
mikorov
i
think
other
than
that
the
wings
are
looking
good
and
chevy
is
holding
his
own
not
great
but
maybe
chevy
has
let
in
or
soft
goals
so
far
but
they
all
didnt
matter
however
his
recent
history
has
been
inconsistant
play
but
comes
up
big
when
it
counts
the
score
was
i
think
when
the
goal
you
mentioned
was
scored
in
the
third
period
when
it
looked
like
toronto
was
coming
back
chevy
was
exceptional
i
can
see
him
as
a
barraso
style
playoff
goalie
inconsistant
when
theres
nothing
on
the
line
but
comes
up
big
when
really
needed
i
guess
well
both
find
out
ron
and
one
of
my
major

is
to

im
pretty

ive

i

there
were
any
others
i
am
not

sure
about
the
celebrated
players

tod

played
for
harvard
in

and
then
went
on
to
play
in

initially
for
moncton
and
currently
for
providence
thanks
to
daryl

for
the
update
appeared
on
david

about
two

now
tod
has
the
distinction
of
being
the
first
american

player
to
go

play
in
the
former

this
was

at
about
the
time
all
those
european

tod
spent

and
played
with
or
against
some
of
the
russian
players
who
have
just
entered
the

and
appeared
on

mike

i

did
anyone
see
the
montreal
quebec
game
yesterday
it
was
tight
right
down
to
the
last
second
of
the
third
period
in
the
overtime
roy
and
hextall
played
like
they
were
gods
ok
so
montreal
won
they
deserved
it
after
getting
their
first
goal
in
overtime
waved
off
because
the
puck
was
hit
in
with
a
high
stick
their
second
goal
in
overtime
was
also
replayed
but
i
could
not
tell
if
it
was
the
montreal
player
who
kicked
it
in
the
puck
definitely
was
not
directed
in
by
a
stick
anyways
montreal
is
back
into
the
series
the
overhead
replay
pretty
clearly
showed
that
it
was
the
quebec
defender
who
deflected
the
puck
the
replay
officials
did
not
take
nearly
as
much
time
to
make
this
call
as
they
did
for
the
first
nongoal
so
it
seemed
pretty
noncontroversial
i
agree
that
it
was
a
great
game
good
to
see
roy
and
damphousse
back
into
form
hopefully
the
sign
of
good

only
my
opinions
subject
bowman
needs
credit
during
the
first
three
games
of
the
pensdevils
series
i
have
been
impressed
time
and
time
again
by
the
pure
talent
of
the
pens
jagr
maceachern
and
barrasso
have
been
especially
fun
to
watch
but
one
element
of
this
team
which
goes
unnoticed
seems
to
be
scotty
bowman
despite
brooks
lunatic
comments
and
despite
the
devils
line
changing
adantage
in
last
nights
game
bowman
has
been
able
to
keep
his
cool
and
keep
the
devils
in
the
dark
granted
the
helldwellers
had
the
pens
bottled
up
for
a
while
last
night
but
bowman
was
eventually
able
to
configure
his
lineup
to
get
the
job
done
his
ability
to
throw
out
new
looks
and
strategies
at
a
moments
notice
is
incredible
bowman
seems
to
have
a
terrific
ability
of
reading
his
players
on
an
individual
basis
last
night
for
instance
he
realized
that
the
speed
of
jagr
straka
and
maceachern
was
throwing
the
devils
off
balance
as
a
result
straka
received
many
more
shifts
than
average
jagr
played
almost
the
entire
game
he
was
always
on
the
puck
and
maceachern
scored
a
goal
while
complementing
jagr
many
times
throughout
the
night
his
ability
to
commit
to
one
player
in
crucial
situations
is
commendable
especially
when
a
coach
of
such
a
talented
team
might
simply
rely
on
the
overall
talent
to
dominate
and
to
bring
about
success
while
no
one
can
replace
the
genius
and
optimism
of
badger
bob
johnson
bowman
in
his
own

has
made
himself

dino
getting
shots
in
front
of
the
net
he
should
expect
it
this
is
playoff
hockey
where
anything
goes
you
lose
one
game
in
the
regular
season
and
its
not
so
bad
you
lose
a
game
in
the
playoffs
and
its
a
difficult
thing
to
overcome
ive
watched
hockey
and
played
it
too
for
a
number
of
years
and
i
havent
seen
one
postseason
game
where
the
forward
in
front
of
the
net
has
not
finished
without
any
bruises
on
the
back
of
his
leg
the
leafs
are
not
doing
a
good
job
in
clearing
the
net
and
potvin
has
been
forced
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
i
remember
when
cicarelli
used
to
play
for
the
london
knights
ohl
he
always
was
a
nuisance
in
front
of
the
net
and
the
goalies
took
exception
to
this
he
also
complained
in
this
mornings
paper
about
what
happened
last
night
but
to
me
its
a
lot
of
bellyaching
his
team
is
up
and
he
complains
about
being
whackedi
wonder
what
would
happen
if
he
tried
to
do
the
same
thing
in
front
of
billy
smith
or
a
younger
ron
hextall
seems
dino
would
need
two
artifical
legs
dino
should
take
it
as
part
of
the
game
and
thank
his
lucky
stars
that
hes
in
the
playoffs
and
has
a
good
chance
to
go
the
finals
well
i
agree
that
if
youre
going
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
that
you
should
expect
to
get
hit
and
hacked
at
in
general
you
should
expect
to
finish
the
game
with
some
bruises
however
there
is
a
fine
line
between
hacking
at
a
guy
causing
some
pain
and
discomfort
and
blatantly
attempting
to
injure
another
player
felix
potvin
imo
crossed
that
line
on
wednesday
that
two
hander
on
ciccarelli
was
way
out
of
line
i
lost
a
lot
of
respect
for
potvin
because
of
that
it
showed
an
immaturity
he
did
not
slash
at
ciccarelli
to
simply
try
to
remove
him
from
the
slot
area
a
legal
position
for
dino
to
be
in
instead
he
slashed
in
an
attempt
to
injure
it
was
out
of
shear
frustration
as
a
leaf
supporter
just
a
supporter
im
not
a
leaf
fan
really
i
was
very
disappointed
youre
right
in
mentioning
billy
smith
and
ron
hextall
at
least
in
his
philly
days
they
both
crossed
that
same
line
at
times
and
for
that
reason
many
fans
and
players
disliked
them
thats
why
their
names
always
comes
up
as
examples
when
we
talk
about
these
issues
lets
hope
that
felix
doesnt
do
that
again
id
hate
to
see
anyone
even
dino
although
i
admit
i
dont
like
him
very
much

seriously

came

he

decided

have
some

to
help
him
sleep

is
ok
now
for

an
ocd
sufferrer
can
wash
his

over

over
and
still
think
theyre
dirty
he
might
check
the
oven
ten
times
to
be

its
turned
off
he
might
see
a

about
something
and
automatically
assume
the
situation
is
the

malarchuk
has
dramatically
decreased

still

he
went
off

this

had

bad

i

was
in
the
hospital
for

pens
that
would
be
clint
malarchuck
it
was
speculated
at
the
time
that
the
injury
was
so
serious
that
had
he
been
playing
at
the
other
end
of
the
rink
at
the
time
he
was
playing
in
the
same
end
as
the
ambulence
is
parked
he
never
would
have
survived
ditto
if
he
were
playing
anything
other
than
a
league
with
an
ambulance
on
standby
if
youve
seen
video
tape
of
the
incident
it
is
amazing
how
much
blood
there
was
it
was
literally
spurting
out
all
over
the
ice
as
clint
grabbed
his
neck
and
watched
the
puddle
in
horror
amazingly
enough
he
made
a
full
recovery
and
played
again
in
the
nhl
he
was
getting
on
in
years
at
the
time
of
the
incident
anyway
and
didnt
play
for
too
long
afterward
some
people
speculated
that
he
just
couldnt
get
himself
back
together
after
the
incident
and
i
think
he
had
a
bunch
of
other
personal
problems
dogging
him
afterward
he
did
eventually
get
back
to
form
and
played
another
year
or
so
after
that
and
then
i
believe
he
retired
anyone
else

tonelli

the

winner
to

the

perhaps

deleted
randy
graca
seems
to
think
murray
is
the
best
gm
in
the
league
i
think
quinn
is
one
of
several
who
are
better
plus
his
team
quinns
has
improved
a
much
greater
amount
than
detroit
since
he
took
over
with
them
how
do
you
figure
both
vancouver
and
detroit
did
the
same
thing
last
year
they
both
won
their
division
they
had
close
to
the
same
number
of
points
they
both
went
down
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
before
finally
escaping
in
games
and
they
both
got
knocked
out
in
the
second
round
by
teams
they
should
have
been
able
to
beat
with
less
talent
specifically
if
i
remember
correctly
third
place
teams
how
does
this
make
vancouver
more
improved
further
if
im
not
mistaken
the
wings
had
more
points
than
vancouver
at
the
end
of
this
season
albeit
not
many
when
quinn
took
over
vancouver
several
years
ago
not
last
year
they
regularily
missed
the
playoffs
i
cant
recall
if
they
missed
the
playoffs
the
year
before
his
hiring
but
they
probably
did
quinn
has
improved
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibre
to
a
serious
contender
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
was
a
contender
to
win
the
norris
division
and
possibly
even
a
stanley
cup
contender
so
quinn
has
improved
his
team
more
than
murray
has
since
taking
over
as
a
gm
quinn
is
one
example
of
a
better
gm

when
quinn
took
over
vancouver
several
years
ago
not
last
year
they
regularily
missed
the
playoffs
i
cant
recall
if
they
missed
the
playoffs
the
year
before
his
hiring
but
they
probably
did
quinn
has
improved
the
team
from
nonplayoff
calibre
to
a
serious
contender
when
murray
took
over
in
detroit
the
were
about
a
team
that
was
a
contender
to
win
the
norris
division
and
possibly
even
a
stanley
cup
contender
the
last
year
before
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wings
did
not
make
the
playoffs
while
they
had
been
considered
a
possible
contender
when
jacques
demers
first
arrived
in
his
last
two
years
they
were
respectively
embarrassed
in
the
first
round
by
chicago
and
then
failed
to
make
the
playoffs
at
a
time
a
might
add
when
there
were
only
five
teams
in
the
norris
its
true
that
vancouver
did
not
make
the
playoffs
for
many
a
year
before
quinn
came
but
in
those
years
the
smythe
division
was
a
loti
mean
a
lot
tougher
division
than
the
norris
also
known
as
the
snorris
division
vancouver
had
to
play
edmonton
and
calgary
both
very
legitimate
stanley
cup
contenders
eight
times
a
year
while
detroit
got
to
play
such
powerhouses
as
toronto
and
minnesota
now
edmonton
is
hardly
even
a
force
in
the
league
and
the
smythe
even
has
the
mighty
san
jose
sharks
while
over
this
same
period
of
time
in
which
vancouver
was
improving
so
was
everybody
in
the
norris
except
st
louis
detroit
had
to
improve
just
to
keep
up
with
the
competition
in
their
division
they
had
to
improve
a
lot
to
get
better
than
their
competition
in
the
norris
bryan
murray
inherited
a
team
with
very
little
talent
for
really
good
players
they
had
yzerman
burr
and
probert
and
that
was
about
it
and
no
doubt
some
will
dispute
whether
burr
and
probert
were
that
good
the
rest
were
either
very
green
rookies
or
washed
up
veterans
the
only
reason
they
got
as
far
as
they
did
in
the
years
before
murray
came
was
due
to
the
coaching
of
demers
who
at
least
at
first
got
every
last
ounce
of
effort
possible
out
of
his
team
then
even
his
coaching
began
to
degrade
so
quinn
has
improved
his
team
more
than
murray
has
since
taking
over
as
a
gm
quinn
is
one
example
of
a
better
gm
than
murray
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
detroit
wasnt
in
as
bad
a
shape
standings
wise
when
murray
took
over
as
vanc
was
when
quinn
took
over
some
of
which
i
outlined
above
but
murray
did
not
have
any
better
personnel
to
work
with
at
the
outset
than
did
quinn
with
the
exception
of
yzerman
and
one
player
cannot
alone
make
a
team
into
a
stanley
cup
contender
as
im
sure
everyone
reading
this
will
agree
well
be
able
to
see
better
which
team
is
really
the
most
improved
when
they
face
each
other
in
the
conference
final
assuming
they
dont
get
knocked
out
like
last
year

the

is
fucking
ridicules

the

they

i

i
would
have
gone
throught

however
everybody
is
getting
pissed
off
at
espn
but
they
are
not
the
ones
to
blame
they
have
prior
contracts
that
they
just
cant
simply
break
whenever
they
want
to
the
nhl
is
to
blame
when
they
signed
the
deal
with
espn
they
had
to
know
of
this
they
had
to
know
shit
like
this
would
happen
since
they
wouldnt
have
complete
priority
the

should
be
feeling
the
heat
that
is
being
thrown
at

how
can
the
nhl
do
this
to
its

how
dare
they
we
are
the
ones
that
make
the
damn
league
exist
and
they
cant
even
televise
complete
playoff
games
for
us
to
watch
they
more
i
write
about
this
the
more
pissed
off
i
get
we
must
let
the
nhl
know
that
we
expect
a
little
better
than
this
if
anybody
out
there
knows
how
to
go
about
doing
this
let
me
and
everybody
else
know
well
i
had
to
get
that
off
my
chest
and
while
im
at
it
mario
is
the
michael
jordan
of
hockey
all
that
fucker
has
to
do
is
fall
on
the
ice
and
the
closet
guy
to
him
gets
at
least
last
night
in
the
game
between
nj
and
pitt
he
was
being
pushed
while
skating
across
the
front
of
the
goal
while
trying
to
get
a
shot
off
the
guy
on
him
was
doing
a
good
job
so
he
got
off
a
weak
shot
but
then
he
decided
to
fall
to
the
ice
then
the
fucking
refvan
helloamend
called
the
guy
for
holding
they
replayed
the
play
and
my
roomatewho
is
clueless
about
hockey
wanted
to
know
what
the
nj
guy
did
to
get
a
call
because
it
was
so
fucking
obvious
the
nj
player
had
both
hands
on
his
stick
and
no
he
did
not
trip
him
it
is
simple
mario
gets
touched
he
falls
to
the
ice
automatic
but
the
thing
that
really
pissed
me
off
is
pitt
scored
the
or
goal
i
dont
remember
on
the
resulting
pp
and
eventually
won
his
divingcalls
makes
a
huge
difference
in
the
outcome
of
a
game
they
gotta
stop
the
damn
holding
and
interference
that
is
so
fucking
obvious
that
is
not
hockey
it
allows
inferior
players
to
bring
down
the
level
of
the
better
players
and
allows
inferior
teams
to
beat
better
ones
this
has
pissed
me
off
for
many
years
now
and
it
has
improved
somewhat
however
during
the
playoffs
and
periods
the
damn
refs
must
misplace
their
balls
because
they
sure
dont
make
any
calls
that
show
that
they
got
any
all

there
are
several
problems
with
the
way
the
game
is
being
presented
to
the
fans
i
feel
that
geographical
names
would
enhance
regional
loyalties
more
than
names
honouring
personages
i
think
a
compromise
would
work
namely
honouring
personages
in
conference
names
and
using
geographical
references
in
the
divisional
names
although
i
still
do
not
think
the
move
will
draw
fans
to
the
game
imo
its
a
cosmetic
change
that
bettman
and
the
owners
hope
will
have
an
effect
and
it
doesnt
say
much
for
the
mentality
of
anybody
it
works
on
either
another
thing
that
bothers
me
is
the
points
system
percentages
as
used
in
the
other
major
sports
are
clearly
more
informative
when
i
look
at
the
nhl
standings
the
first
thing
i
have
to
do
is
make
a
quick
calculation
to
account
for
games
in
hand
which
is
almost
always
the
case
some
will
object
to
percentages
claiming
perhaps
that
it
is
an
americanization
of
the
sport
surprise
i
agree
totally
the
points
system
is
fine
if
everybody
at
all
times
has
played
the
same
number
of
games
since
this
is
almost
never
the
case
winning
percentage
is
the
way
to
go
i
dont
particularly
care
if
it
is
an
american
thing
either
if
it

is
lacking

a

boston

goals

the

the

need
to
score
first
if

that
they

they

then
they

went

basketball
finally
they
showed
a

that
was
like
sec
i
think
they
should
give
more

ghost
from

past
wow
this
guy
seems
to
be
out
to
prove
something
to
his
old
team
boston
which
sweeney
you
askwell
of
course
bob
sweeney
the
one
that
boston
let
buffalo
get
a
hold
of
they
still
have
sweeneys
which
makes
things
slightly
confusing
game
winner
in
ot
in
game
and
another
big
goal
seconds
after
fuhr
made
point
blank
saves
this
is
why
grant
has
rings
to
put
buffalo
ahead
in
the
yes
neely
countered
a
minute
later
but
hadnt
this
course
of
buffalo
going
ahead
after
being
tied
and
shutting
down
another
few
great
scoring
opportunities
i
think
boston
would
have
notched
their
first
win
of
the
series
well
the
sabres
havent
made
it
to
the
end
of
this
series
yet
but
i
certainly
feel
theyve
got
boston
right
were
they
want
themactually
theyve
got
them
in
a
position
that
neither
buffalo
nor
boston
felt
that
would
come
about
one
more
astronomical
game
by
fuhr
a
few
more
heroics
by
the
rest
of
the
team
this
is
a
team
sport
afterall
and
i
think
borque
neely
jouneau

be
swinging
a

weather
is
perfect
for

season
real
soon
im
not
gonna
waiger
anything
on
this
because
ive
seen
some
really
strange
things
happen
in
both
pro
and
college
hockey
talking
about
golfwas
that
a
hockey
swing
golf
swing
or
baseball
swing
that
hawerchuck
used
in
the
last
shot
of
the
game
that
khmylev
deflected
in
for
the
big
one
the
whole
ot
all
minute
of
it
was
a
tesiment
to
buffalos
ability
to
really
be
persistent
and
grind
it
out
in
the
end
something
they
werent
necessarily
in
the
regular
season
the
sabres
pushed
hard
and
forced
borque
to
blatently
take
down
bodger
in
the
opening
seconds
i
dont
normally
like
penalties
being
called
in
such
ultracritical
points
but
this
was
blatent
finally
the
sabres
won
a
faceoff
they
werent
that
hot
in
this
dept
the
rest
of
the
game
when
lafontaine
scooped
at
the
puck
times
when
hawerchuck
took
his
shot
quite
a
boomer
but
blue
stopped
this
one
he
took
a
few
steps
over
to
get
his
own
rebound
and
slapped
at
it
again
without
setting
it
up
i
didnt
realize
it
went
in
until
the
announcer
started
screaming
they
score
they
score
the
best
was
seeing
lafontaine
jumping
up

down
skating
a

the

the

less
than
years

puts
a
big
restriction
on
what
the

can
pick
up
however
i
do
believer
they
need
to
pick
up
some
players
who
will
add
toughness
to
the
team
but
you
have
to
remember
that
youre
unlikely
to
get
any
real
quality
free
agents
who
do
not
require
compensation
the
sharks
tried
with
makarov
who
was
probably
the
top
of
the
class
among
noncompensation
free
agents
but
even
he
probably
wouldnt
have
helped
too
much
dont
expect
to
get
top
quality
just
some
toughness
i
dont
view
makarov
as
a

who
would

wont
be

mcgillhammond
johan
garpenlov
would
you
really
rather
have
those
two
instead
of
johan
by
your
logic
then
you
enjoy
having
falloon
and
ozolinsh
on
injured
reserve
by
your
logic
then
you
think
that
if
the
sharks
had
kept
mcgill
and
hammond
that
you
can
guarantee
that
falloon
and
ozolinsh
wouldnt
have
gotten
hurt
think
again
there
was
a
chance
that
mcgill
would
have
caused
ozolinsh
to
get
stuck
at
kc
and
as
you
know
hammond
is
worthless
and
mcgill
is
almost
worthless
well
wilson
maybe
but
i
dont
think
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
really
injured
on
cheapshots
who
said
they
were
if
they
werent
then
i
dont
see
any
justification
that
having
mcgill
and
hammond
around
would
prevent
their
injuries
if
the
injuries
of
falloon
and
ozolinsh
were
purely
accidental
then
what
could
mcgill
and
hammond
have
done
to
prevent
them
hey
get
off
the
mcgillhammond
thing
im
no
fan
of
either
my
point
is
that
last
year
the
sharks
had
toughness
that
was
missing
this
year
this
year
we
had
more
skill
im
all
for
that
but
if
your
skill
players
keep
getting
beat
up
and
injured
they
cant
do
you
much
good
whether
its
a
cheap
shot
or
not
you
cant
let
the
other
teams
push
you
around
the
sharks
simply
got
pushed
around
to
much
other
teams
knew
this
they
knew
they
could
aggressively
check
the
sharks
and
not
pay
for
it
adding
some
players
in
the
off
season
who
will
add
some
toughness
to
the
team
will
help
insure
that
next
season
other
teams
will
be
more
hesistant
to
vigorously
check
our
skill
players
or
to
take
cheap
shots
it
doesnt

no

it

the
most
misleading
hockey

publishes
a
more

statistic

ice

and
some
measure
of
its
quality
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situations
like
protecting

lead
late
in
the

is
he
matched
up
against

top

i
would

rather
see
the

altogether
instead
of
having
its
dubious
merits
trumpeted
by
those
with
little
understanding
of
its
implications
is
a
useful
statistic
if
a
player
is
on
the
ice
when
his
team
scores
a
lot
of
goals
and
only
allows
a
few
goals
he
must
be
doing
something
right
it
is
especially
useful
to
compare
between
teammates
as
they
play
for
the
same
team
and
should
have
roughly
similar
ratings
if
they
are
equally
good
players
it
can
be
adjusted
with
varying
degrees
of
success
to
compare
between
players
on
different
teams
i
agree
it
would
be
nice
for
the
nhl
to
keep
more
statistics
but
how
useful
are
the
ones
that
you

total
ice

would

it
is
a
missing
stat

arguments
from
before
somehow
measuring
the
quality
of

as
you

would
be
useless
it
would
be
a
better
stat
for
evaluating
coaching
ie
are
the
players
given
quality
ice
time
actually
their
talented
ones
a
very
good
player
could
be
given
low
amounts
of
quality
ice
time
because
of
team
depth
or
a
stupid
coach
who
doesnt
recognize
his
talent
and
a
very
bad
player
could
be
given
lots
of
quality
ice
time
because
of
a
lack
of
team
depth
or
a
stupid
coach
that
thinks
he
is

this

almost
no

mario
is
the
michael
jordan
of
hockey
all
that
fucker
has
to
do
is
fall
on
the
ice
and
the
closet
guy
to
him
gets
at
least
last
night
in
the
game
between
nj
and
pitt
he
was
being
pushed
while
skating
across
the
front
of
the
goal
while
trying
to
get
a
shot
off
the
guy
on
him
was
doing
a
good
job
so
he
got
off
a
weak
shot
but
then
he
decided
to
fall
to
the
ice
then
the
fucking
refvan
helloamend
called
the
guy
for
holding
they
replayed
the
play
and
my
roomatewho
is
clueless
about
hockey
wanted
to
know
what
the
nj
guy
did
to
get
a
call
because
it
was
so
fucking
obvious
the
nj
player
had
both
hands
on
his
stick
and
no
he
did
not
trip
him
it
is
simple
mario
gets
touched
he
falls
to
the
ice
automatic
but
the
thing
that
really
pissed
me
off
is
pitt
scored
the
or
goal
i
dont
remember
on
the
resulting
pp
and
eventually
won
his
divingcalls
makes
a
huge
difference
in
the
outcome
of
a
game
all
agreeing
or
disagreeing
replies
are
welcomed
steve
we
must
have
been
watching
two
different
games
the
devil
had
one
hand
on
marios
elbow
and
pulling
the
elbow
caused
mario
to
fall
so
the
call
was
appropriate
using
clueless
people
to
substantiate
your
claims
doesnt
give
me
a
lot
of
confidence
in
your
call
either
next
time
consider
getting
a
second
opinion
from
a
clueful
observer
or
maybe
all
those
available
disagreed

i
for

am
happy
about

hiring
of

its
too
bad
that
they
i
agree
that
keenan
is
an
excellent
choice
did
you
see
mike
lupicas
column
in
sundays

my
sentiments
exactly
i
think
he
just
may
be
the
one
to
instill
some
hunger
and
fire
into
their
hearts
next
season
either
that
or
hes
going
to
be
kicking
alot
of
butt
reading
through
most
of
these
hockey
news
i
dont
see
many
ranger
fans
writing
im
here
but
am
new
to
this
group
and
have
been
keeping
fairly
quiet
you
know
doing
the
lurking
thing
i
dont
have
a
sense
how
many
rangers
fans
there
are
on
the
list
either
i
am
a
diehard
ranger
fan
i
guess
i
have
to
be
i
sat
in
the
garden
throughout
the
penguins
led
by
marios
goals
decimation
of
them
on
but
am
sick
at
the
abundance
of
talent
that
has
been
totally
untapped
and
the
lack
of
heart
displayed
this
season
i
have
some
final
questions
about
the
way
the
team
was
handled
in
that
last
dreadful
stretch
knowing
they
needed
offensive
help
from
the
blueline
why
didnt
we
see
mike
hurlbut
who
played
pretty
well
when
he
was
called
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
hurlbut
was
injured
for
quite
a
while
im
not
sure
but
i
think
he
may
have
recovered
in
time
for
the
playoff
run
and
if
so
like
you
question
why
he
wasnt
used
why
is
joe
kocur
playing
every
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
i
believe
kocur
was
used
in
many
instances
for
his
intimidation
factor
granted
he
seemed
to
get
an
awful
lot
of
ice
time
for
that
reason
alone
but
you
have
to
realize
that
when
a
team
is
not
doing
any
real
physical
intimidation
id
like
to
have
a
nickel
for
every
time
jd
said
theyve
got
to
take
the
body
more
youve
got
to
at
least
have
some
illusions
how
come
paul
broten
is
relegated
to
street
clothes
for
the
end
of
the
season
at
least
he
plays
with
some
heart
and
character
draws
penalties
and
plays
when
hes
on
the
ice
was
he
in
the
doghouse
for
some
reason
i
agree
and
i
dont
know
joe
cirella
enough
said
sorry
i
dont
agree
with
you
here
i
think
joey
c
did
a
good
job
filling
in
when
he
was
asked
to
i
cant
imagine
that
its
easy
going
from
near
ice
time
to
being
a
full
timer
i
dont
seem
to
remember
him
turning
the
puck
over
at
the
blue
line
too
much
or
failing
to
clear
the
zone
he
worked
hard
and
at
least
didnt
make
any
rookie
mistakes
as
he
said
himself
in
an
interview
he
can
only
give
what
he
has
and
he
did
ranger
fans
may
be
suffering
but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlike
islander
fans
who
only
show
up
when
the
team
wins
absolutely
i
think
attendance
at
the
garden
was
better
on
the
last
day
of
the
season
than
any
average
night
for
the
islanders
fought

mario
is
amazing
the

is
awesome
in
a
way
im
enjoying
the

more
now
that
the

arent
in
them
i
can
really
appreciate
all
the
glory
mario
is
getting
without
hating
him
because
hes
on

he
deserves

with

mentality
saying
that
hurting

anyones

is
asinine
new
rules
and
a
new
referee
system
need
to
be
instituted
right
now
too
many
of
the
real
goons
get
away
with
too
much
because
the
ref
is
watching
the
play
or
supposed
to
beive
seen
koharski
and
van
hellemond
to
name
a
few
with
their
heads
up
their
asses
on
a
few
calls
rather
than
keeping
an
eye
on
the
goofballs
behind
the
play
even
if
the
linesmen
were
able
to
call
all
penalties
it
would
be
an
improvement
unfortunately
that
is
the
way
the
league
is
heading
you
cant
fight
so
the
only
way
to
retaliate
against
someone
is
with
a
cheap
shot

the

isnt

brought
this

high

players
stuck
in

like
neely
who
prefer
fights
to
cheap
shots
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
new
system
lets
face
it
a
cheap
shot
like
high
sticking
is
a
very
effective
method
it
is
easier
to
hide
from
the
refs
has
a
better
chance
of
causing
injury
and
you
can
draw
people
into
fights
that
way
i

it

thats
the

it

during
the

pocklington
may
announce
the

it

that
the
deal
may
simply
be
a
way

northlands
has
offered
to
buy
the
oilers
for
million
earlier
but
the
offer
was
rejected
immediately
by
pocklington
as
for
me
my
opinion
is
divided
edmonton
has
been
fairly
supportive
of
the
oilers
even
though
theyre
a
small
market
team
they
had
many
sellouts
in
the
even
with
the
problems
that
the
team
had
this
year
they
still
brought
in
more
fans
than
many
teams
in
larger
cities
did
on
the
other
hand
if
the
team
does
move
there
is

the

as
i
was

game
i
tear
down
and
throw
on
my
jersey
hunter
scores
i
go
ape
shit
cause
this
is
the
first
caps
game
ive
been
able
to
watch
all
season
and
what
does
espn
do
they
go
back
to
the
blowout
that
nj
hasnt
a
chance
in
hell
of
winning
the
period
ends
and
the
sportscaster
capitols
just
tied
it
up
yes
oops
excuse
me
goes
into
his
penguin
worship
mode
dont
freak
pens
fans
they
are
worthy
of
this
im
so
glad
we
wont
have
to
play
them
as
much
next
year
and
here
comes
the
periodwhat
its
the
blowout
again
oh
they
were
just
waiting
for
the
capisles
to
get
out
of
intermission
good
theyve
put
a
close
game
back
on
wait
whats
this
shit
theyre
showing
the
blowout
again
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggggg
oh
guess
what
the
score
is
now
penguins
switch
games
you
holy
shit
theyre
changing
games
its
about
goddamned
time
lets
see
if
theyll
stay
later
i
think
this
proves
by
point
the
caps
game
goes
into
overtime
but
due
to
contractual
obligations
they
have
to
switch
to
the
fucking
baseball
sorry
for
my
language
but
im
pissed
what
the
hell
were
they
going
to
do
if
their
scheduled
game
went
into
overtime
espn
get
your
head
out
of
your
ass
now
i
know
there
are
a
lot
first
of
all
i
think
when
espn
covers
the
game
they
do
a
wonderful
job
but
last
night
i
felt
the
same
way
i
really
hate
watching
devilspens
game
everyone
knows
that
devils
are
going
to
get
their
ass
kicked
why
even
bother
showing
them
i
was
so
bored
and
these
espn
people
dont
seem
to
have
any
brain
after
the
sundays
and
last
night
games
they
are
still
going
to
show
devilspens
on
thu
and
sun
what
the
hell
are
they
thinking
about
i
think
if
they
keep
it
up
like
this
nhl
will
never
get
a
major
network
contract
id
rather
see
capsisls
game
which
is
more
exciting
now
i
just
hope
all
baseball
games
are
rained
out
on
espn
so
atleast
we
can
get
diffrent
hockey
games
experience
is

the

announced
yesterday
that
they

fewer

and
will
have

on
some
sort
of
subscription
payperview
system
yuck
this
is
incorrect
this
year
the
pens
had
games
on
free
tv
and
games
on
ppv
next
year
they
will
have
games
on
free
tv
and
on
a
subscription
basis
you
actually
get
more
free
game
than
last
year
and
there
will
be
no
more
radioonly
games
yes
youre
right

from

someone
surely
is
getting

my

is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the

of

i
read

its

that
vancouver
did

for
many
a
year
before
quinn
came
but
in
those
years
the
smythe
division
was
a
loti
mean
a
lot
tougher
division
than
the
norris
also
known
as
the
snorris
division
vancouver
had
to
play
edmonton
and
calgary
both
very
legitimate
stanley
cup
contenders
eight
times
a
year
while
detroit
got
to
play
such
powerhouses
as
toronto
and
minnesota
now
edmonton
is
hardly
even
a
force
in
the
league
and
the

even
has

the

once

even
after

four
times

and
everyone
thinks
its
doomsville
over
this

period
of
time
in
which
vancouver
was
improving
so
was
everybody
in

norris
except
st

detroit
had
to
improve
just
to
keep
up
with
the
competition
in

division
they
had
to
improve
a
lot
to
get
better
than
their
competition
in
the
norris
bryan
murray
inherited
a
team
with
very
little
talent
for
really
good
players
they
had
yzerman
burr
and
probert
and
that
was
about
it
and
no
doubt
some
will
dispute
whether
burr
and
probert
were
that
good
the
rest
were
either
very
green
rookies
or
washed
up
veterans
the
only
reason
they
got
as
far
as
they
did
in
the
years
before
murray
came
was
due
to
the
coaching
of
demers
who
at
least
at
first
got
every
last
ounce
of
effort
possible
out
of
his
team
then
even
his
coaching
began
to
degrade

there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
detroit
wasnt

bad

wise
when
murray
took
over
as
vanc
was
when
quinn
took
over
some
of
which
i
outlined

murray
did
not
have
any
better
personnel
to
work
with
at
the
outset
than
did
quinn
with
the
exception
of
yzerman
and
one
player
cannot
alone
make

a

college
hockey
east

colorado
alaska
excepted
with
the
new
popularity
of

i
dont
think
trading
kisio
was
intrinsically
a
mistake
however
trading
him
for
a
round
pick
would
be
he
should
have
been
worth
a
lot
more
than
a
round
pick
for
a
playoff
team
in
fact
i
would
intimate
that
the
offers
the
sharks
got
this
year
for
kisio
were
way
greater
than
just
a
round
pick
hindsights
nobody
expected
kisio
to
have
his
best
career
year
besides
without
kisio
the
sharks
would
have
tanked
even
earlier
in
the
season
and
gund
might
have
gotten
a
little
more
serious
about
getting
joe
murphy
a
guy
who
definitely
would
be
around
years
from
now
when
the
sharks
do
make
the
playoffs
what
else
could
be
done
the
gunds
offered
million
for
murphy
but
the
oilers
wanted
prospects
which
the
sharks
declined
to
give
which
i
think
is
correct
i
didnt
mean
to
imply
that
gunds
offer
wasnt
enough
gunds
offer
was
the
right
but
too
late
in
the
season
offered
in
november
lets
sather
buy
a
replacement
for
murphy
this
season
and
make
the
playoffs
this
year
in
march
doesnt
help
sather
with
his
immediate
objectives
doesnt
help
with
long
term
objectives
only
a
prospect
or
draft
pick
does
and
no
way
should
the
sharks
do
that
however
getting
back
to
whatif
games
had
kisio
been
traded
to
chicago
last
year
then
the
sharks
go
for
october
and
maybe
gund
panicks
sooner
in
november
and
heres
another
whatif
twist
chicago
would
have
had
kisio
this
season
they
never
go
after
murphy
in
the
first
place
because
kelly
is
having
his
best
season
bigger
guys
in
chicago
so
gund
has
no
competition
so
ferriera
sather
and
keenan
all
look
like
geniuses
a
broken
fax
machine
and
ferriera
keenan
and
maybe
kingston
and
maybe
even
green
lose
their
jobs
kind
of
makes
you
shiver
doesnt
it
bottomline
for
every
black
scenario
any
of
you
can
concoct
for
kisio
leaving
i
can
concoct
an
equally
bright
one
if
the
kisiofiasco
was
the
cause
of
ferierras
down
fall
i
hope
it
wasnt
because
he
tried
to
trade
kisio
but
because
he
screwed
it
up
nonetheless
im
sorry
ferierra
and
kingston
are
gone
and
i
wish
gund
would
follow
and
what
have
the
gunds
done
exactly
that
caused
you
to
wish
that
they
were
gone
are
you
serious
let
ferierra
go
fire
kingston
these
last
two
basically

that

starting

merely

do

actually
take

i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
well
here
in
detroit
we
get
to
see
and
hear
don
cherry
quite
regularly
the
detroit
area
picks
up
hockey
night
in
canada
from
cbc
ch
in
windsor
where
we
see
don
cherrys
coaches
corner
between
periods
we
also
get
to
see
don
cherrys
grapevine
just
before
the
game
the
grapevine
is
a
hockey
talk
show
where
don
talks
to
a
player
or
coach
about
what
else
hockey
its
actually
a
pretty
good
show
and
don
isnt
as
annoying
as
he
is
on
coaches
corner
i
think
this
is
were
don
got
his
nickname
grapes
but
im
not
sure
don
use
to
coach
the
boston
bruins
i
dont
know
exactly
when
that
was
could
someone
fill
me
in
on
this
info
a
local
radio
station
here
in
detroit
wllz
talks
to
don
every
tuesday
morning
personally
ive
had
my
fill
of
donny
he
really
pisses
me
off
sometimes
during
the
detroittoronto
game
monday
night
on
cbc
don
gave
high
praise
to
doug
gilmour
saying
he
was
a
twoway
player
and
not
just
a
designated
goal
scorer
and
that
he
is
probably
the
best
player
in
the
game
because
of
that
thats
fine
and
i
agree
that
gilmour
is
a
good
twoway
player
but
he
said
the
exact
same
thing
about
yzerman
about
a
month
ago
on
a
local
radio
talk
show
what
gives
it
seems
like
he
just
has
a
set
speech
that
he
changes
when
he
goes
from
city
to
city
don
cherry
i
think
insert
star
player
name
for
city
that
he
is
in
is
the
best
twoway
player
in
the
league
today
there
have
been
other
times
cant
remember
exactly
what
he
said
that
he
basically
changed
his
opinions
to
match
the
audience
he
was
talking
to
someone
here
on
the
net
said
something
about
how
don
criticized
mario
lemieux
but
when
the
time
comes
for
don
to
broadcast
the
cup
playoffs
from

yes
i

the

will
make
it
out

conference
don
will
apologize
left

right
for

it

even
when

will
continue
to

i
know
this
is
still
a
better
situation
compared
to
rest
of
georgia

etc
but
it
is
still
pretty
annoying
at
least
in
pittsburgh
we
had
a
network
preemptionchannel
which
showed
all
netwoork
shows
prempted
by
the
local
affiliate
i
asked
them
what
their
problem
was
i
told
them
that
a
local
rating
was
not
that
bad
considering
it
was
the
first
nhl
game
shown
after
a
long
time
without
much
promotion
besides
their
syndicated
programming
in
the
afternoon
is
usually
low
rated
so
what
did
they
have
to
lose
by
showing
nhl
playoffs
she
told
me
that
they
had
contractual
obligations
i
asked
her
if
golf
was
shown
oin
abc
would
contractual
obligations
come
in
the
way
and
how
come
contractual
obligations
didnt
come
in
the
way
of
last
weeks
telecast
she
then
couldnt
give
me
a
coherent
answer
also
i
added
that
atlanta
had
one
of
the
highest
neutral
site
game
attendances
and
that
the
demographics
were
good
i
think
abc
and
other
networks
should
begin
to
tie
their
high
rated
programs
like
roseanne
in
with
thier
sports
programming
i
hope
that
everyone
in
atlanta
who
reads
this
bboard
calls
wsb
and
complain
bitterlyt
about
this
tell
them
you
will
stop
watching

be
very
unprofessional
in

did

listen
to
the
pregame
interview
will
bowman
and
compare
that

i

bowman
is
a
master
of
the

remember
last

him

put
it
because
he
allowed
a
very
cheap
goal
if
you
think
roy
outplayed
hextall
perhaps
you
should
get
a
tape
of
the
game
and
watch
the
first
minutes
of
the
third
period
nhl
goaltenders
make
some
great
saves
if
they
did
not
they
would
not
be
in
the
nhl
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
expect
any
particular
goalie
to
be
able
to
make
the
great
saves
all
of
the
time
even
though
they
are
occasionally
required
however
when
it
comes
to
a
routine
shot
like
sakics
especially
at
such
a
crucial
time
in
a
game
i
dont
think
there
are
any
legitimate
excuses
hextall
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucky
bounces
description
of
lucky
bounces
hextall
wasnt
particularly
brilliant
on
those
plays
i
am
not
arguing
that
hextall
was
brilliant
i
am
arguing
is
that
a
relatively
weak
wrist
shot
from
the
outside
of
the
circle
shold
not
result
in
a
goal
but
it
was
just
the
goal
the
timing
stank
but
against
an
explosive
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportunity
too
many
with
a
powerplay
that
was
totally
unnecessary
in
a
onegoal
game
with
less
than
a
minute
to
go
there
is
no
such
thing
as
just
the
goal
i
have
not
defended
dionne
for
taking
the
penalty
eitherin
fact
i
think
it
was
a
boneheaded
move
but
it
led
to
one
goal
only
and
montreal
had
a
two
goal
lead
my
main
concern
is
the
second
goal
this
most
certainly
was
a
team
loss
leclair
missed
his
opportunities
as
did
bellows
and
brunet
dionne
took
a
bad
penalty
damphousse
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
means
can
be
singled
out
for
this
loss
what
you
say
about
the
skaters
is
absolutely
true
but
realize
that
the
game
was
effectively
won
you
could
watch
any
hockey
game
in
fact
you
could
watch
any
sporting
event
period
and
spend
hours
discussing
the
what
ifs
wrt
missed
opportunities
they
are
not
important
when
the
final
result
is
decided
if
i
get
the
time
soon
ill
watch
the
game
again
and
email
you
a
list
of
lucky
montreal
bounces
and
a
list
of
quebec
offensive
screwups
montreal
was
leading
with
a
minute
to
go
the
goalie
is
the
last
line
of
defence
and
i
will
grant
that
extra
attention
is
focussed
on
him
sometimes
without
justification
but
roy
gave
up
a
lousy
goal
and
a
team
cannot
afford
such
a
goal
roy
looked
like
a
player
in
an
industrial
league
on
sakics
shot
and
hextall
didnt
on
dionnes
goal
please
who
cares
of
what
value
is
it
to
justify
one
lousy
play
with
a
totally
unrelated
lousy
play
i
could
do
a
hextall
critique
if
youd
like
but
if
youre
going
to
assess
his
performance
keep
in
mind
that
he
made
the
key
saves
at
the
key
times
roy
is
paid
big
money
because
that
is
his
value
compared
to
other
goalies
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
for
the
record
i
did
not
say
that
roy
was
not
one
of
the
top
goaltenders
in
the
league
in
fact
i
agree
that
he
is
the
montreal
media
is
the
quickest
to
heap
praise
and
then
hurl
derogatory
comments
against
the
habs
they
are
no
better
than
uninformed
fans
i
assume
you
are
referring
to
me
however
i
have
pointed
out
that
i
think
the
loss
can
be
blamed
on
roy
i
have
not
said
he
sucks
nor
do
i
think
ive
made
any
other
derogatory
comments
if
you
regard
objective

i

kevin

nicholls
punched

raised

william

writes
as
a
person
who
has
rarely
even
seen
don
cherry
and
doesnt
know
anything
about
him
i
dont
know
whether
it
is
just
this
area
pittsburgh
of
the
usa
that
is
deprived
of
his
broadcasts
or
whether
hes
a
canadian
thing
altogether
seriously
what
is
he
all
about
i
hes
a
canadian
thing
former
coach
of
the
boston
bruins
and
colorado
rockies
from
the
summaries
that
get
posted
i
gather
that
his
ongoing
beef
this
year
has
been
the
conventional
wisdom
that
canadian
hockey
is
doomed
to
be
second
or
third
rate
behind
the
perceived
emergence
of
the
us
and
european
programs
know
he
was
a
coach
at
one
time
and
from
the
volume
of
posts
about
him
someone
surely
is
getting
a
steady
diet
of
him
somehow
but
my
question
is
what
is
the
deal
with
him
secondly
are
the
comments
of
his
that
i
after
he
left
the
rockies
he
got
a
job
with
cbcs
hockey
night
in
canada
and
hasnt
looked
back
since
actually
he
did
work
for
cbc
at
least
on
playoff
season
after
the
rockies
were
eliminated
read
about
on
the
net
merely
flame
bait
or
do
people
actually
take
him
seriously
i
gotta
tell
you
from
what
i
see
he
really
sounds
like
an
id
say
its
a
combination
of
flame
bait
and
serious
journalism
the
closest
thing
youll
find
to
cherry
in
the
us
is
stan
fischler
a
selfdescribed
hockey
maven
the
similarities
are
that
they
both
say
things
that
get
people
upset
the
difference
is
that
cherry
knows
the
game
and
fischler
doesnt
ass
let
me
know
maybe
im
missing
something
dons
a
character
if
he
were
completely
rational
and
noncontroversial
he
wouldnt
have
a
job
by
some
definitions
he
could
be
called
an
ass
but
then
some
people
feel
the
same
about
mike
lang
another
character
that
i
wish
would
get
wider
exposure
only
one
national
telecast
last
year
mike
eisler
mreengsuncom
not
only
are
they
leafs
the
best
team
but
their
fans
are
even
more
intelligent
and
insightful
than
pittsburghs
their
players
are
mighty
bright
too
i
mean
he
really
was
going
to
get
his
wallet

presumably
a

of
decent
players
in

that
wouldnt

at
the
highest
level

still
valuable
role
players
however
my
guess
would
be
that
the
finnish
canada
cup
team
would
be
a
team
in
the
nhl
wow
now
it
looks
like
you
dont
like
our
players
what
about
guys
like
nieminen
jutila
riihijarvi
varvio
laukkanen
makela
keskinen
and
even
if
he
is
aging
ruotsalainen
the
main
difference
between
finnish
and
north
american
players
is
that
our
players
tend
to
be
better
in
the
larger
rink
the
canadian
defenders
are
usually
slower
that
defenders
in
europe
and
i
think
that
there
was
more
in
our
success
than
ketterer
and
luck
though
they
helped
i
think
that
the
main
reason
was
that
the
team
worked
well
together
thats
true
game
is
so
different
here
in
europe
compared
to
nhl
northame
ricans

better
in
small
rinks
and
europeans
in
large
rinks
an
average
european
player
from
sweden
finland
russian
or
tsechslovakia
is
a
better
skater
and
puckhandler
than
his
nhl
colleague
especially
defenders
in
nhl
are
mainly
slow
and
clumsy
selnne
has
also
said
that
in
the
finnish
smleague
game
is
more
based
on
skill
than
in
nhl
in
finland
he
couldnt
get
so
many
breakaways
because
defenders
here
are
an
average
much
better
skaters
than
in
nhl
also
alpo
suhonen
said
that
in
nhl
selnnes
speed
accentuates
because
of
clumsy
defensemen
i
have
to
admit
that
the
best
players
come
from
canada
but
those
regulars
arent
as
skilful
as

i
watched

in

i
was
astonished
about
the
behaviour
of
the
german
audience
the
german
team
got
a
few
penalties
in
the
last
period
and
the
crowd
went
it
was
not
just
those
penalties
most
of
all
it
was
the
penalty
the
referee
didnt
call
on
the
czechs
right
before
their
first
goal
grazy
they
threw
coins
extra
pucks
and
other
trash
into
the
rinkis
that
stupid
or
what
i
guess
the
canadian
referee
one
of
the
isostarbros
gave
the
german
team
a
penalty
for
that
but
it
didnt
help
much
i
guess
the
germans
just
are
proud
over
their
nazikillemalleveryone
dont
you
think
its
quite
silly
to
call
it
a
nazi
attitude
when
some
people
throw
coins
on
the
ice
hey
i
dont
approve
the
behavior
of
these
guys
especially
not
in
a
wc
game
but
i
cant
see
any
reason
for
using
the
word
nazi
in
this
connection
butusgermanssucks
attitudethey
just
seem
to
have
that
kind
of
attitude
in
every

sport
remember
the
european
champs
in
stockholm
in
soccer
soccer
hooligans
are
not
just
a
german
problem
remember
the
world
cup
in
italy
again
theres
a
big
difference
between
throwing
coins
and
smashing
shopwindows
or
fighting
with
other
socalled
fans
who
come
to
a
wc
just
to
see
if
the
dutch
or
the
english
or
the
germans
are
the
best
bruisers
which
other
sports
are
you
talking
about
i
dont
think
soccer
is
every
possible
sport
it
really
pisses
me
off
i
do
not
mean
that
every
single
german
has
this
attitude
that
sucks
but
most
of
them
seem
to
do
how
many
germans
do
you
know
do
you
think
out
of
is
most
of
them
if
you
hear
about
some
white
policemen
beating
a
black
man
in

what
do
you

this

all

and
there
is
no
justification
for
vukota

pilon
to
play
for
the
isles
vukota
is
absolutely
the
worst
puck
handler
in
the
world
he
couldnt
hit
a
bull
in
the
ass
with
a
banjo
al
must
remember
a
few
years
back
when
mick
scored
goals
in
one
period
against
the
caps
in
a
isles
win
i
was
there
and
was
astonished
as
was
the
rest
of
the
crowd
wakeup
al
years
later
hes
gotten
worse
hes
a
cheap
shot
artist
and
always
ends
up
getting
stupidsenseless
penalties
i
think
he
would
make
a
good
police
officier
as
for
pilon
he
cant
carry
the
puck
out
to
center
ice
by
himself
he
either
makes
a
bad
pass
resulting
in
a
turnover
or
he
attempts
to
bring
the
puck
towards
the
neutral
zone
and
skates
right
into
an
opposing
skater
he
cant
stay
on
his
skates
with
most
forwards
or
centers
he
either
falls
down
or
committs
a
penalty
call
up
somebody
from
capital
district
al
as
far
as
the
playoffs
the
isles
are
as
difficult
to
figure
out
as
the
caps
two
good
teams
with
talent
but
so
inconsistent
they
should
meet
in
the
first
round
the
isles
seem
to
play
up
to
the
level
of
their
competition
so
they
should
play
well
against
jersey
tonite
itll
probably
be
another
tight
game
as
the
last
games
hve
been
for
the
isles
i
wish
when
the
get
a
lead
they
could
continue
to
pour
it
on
instead
of
settling
back
into
a
defensive
shell
and
letting
the
opposition
get
back
in
the
game
al
must
understand
he
cant
do
with
this
team
what
he
did
with
the

maybe

someone
correct

in

things
look
bleak
for

at

in

i
suspect
that
the
next
team
from

will
be
that
team
that

ive
been
suffering
lately
with
the
boston

hot
while
montreal
swans

type
years
but
i
do
have
the
sure
knowledge
that
the
montreal
braintrust
will
keep
plugging
away
until
they
hit
the
right
formula
for
yet
another
cup
whereas
if
i
were
a
boston
fan
id
have
this
kind
of
despair
that
as
long
as
harry
sinden
is
running
the

the

will
always
be
good

never

not

the

you

it
definitely
needs
to
be

a

example
is
if
you
look

the
penguins
individual
you
will
find
very
few
minuses
that
only
makes
common
sense
since
they
didnt
lose
many
games
until
the
nhl
publishes
a
more
useful
quantifiable
statistic
including
ice
time
per
game
and
some
measure
of
its
quality
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situations
like
protecting
a
lead
late
in
the
game
is
he
matched
up
against
the
other
teams
top
one
or
two
lines
shorthanded

much
rather
see
the

altogether

unfortunately
you

in

joseph
charles
achkar
says
it
was
nice
to
see
espn
show
game
between
the
wings
and
leafs
since
the
cubs
and
astros
got
rained
out
instead
of
showing
another
baseball
game
they
decided
on
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
a
classy
move
by
espn
it
was
a
classy
move
but
it
looks
like
espn
is
going
to
devote
most
of
the
coverage
to
the
pens
on
tuesday
night
they
continued
to
broadcast
the
pendevil
game
even
though
pittsburgh
had
the
game
well
in
control
granted
they
did
show
some
bonus
coverage
of
the
caps
and
isles
but
they
cut
away
from
the
close
game
which
went
into
double
ot
to
update
us
on
the
fifth
goal
of
the
rout
thursday
was
a
good
game
even
if
it
was
the
second
straight
game
between
the
pens
and
devils
imho
they
should
program
some
variety
into
the
telecastsyes
i
know
the
game
shown
on
saturday
is
between
the
bs
and
sabres
probably
throwing
a
bone
to
us
bruin
fans
and
what
about
the
cambell
conference
id
like
to
see
a
game
in
the
norris
or
smythe
why
not
have
back

atmosphere
last
night
at
the
st
louis
arena
as
joseph
and
the
blues
shutout
the
hawks
for
the
second
consecutive
game
people
were
cheering
the
blues
long
before
faceoff
time
and
they
kept
going
for
the
entire
game
my
friends
and
i
went
out
celebrating
until
the
early
morning
hours
with
some
of
the
players
heres
a
game
summary
from
the
st
louis
postdisptach
enjoy
by
dave
luecking
of
the
postdispatch
staff
at
pm
friday
night
the
arena
crowd
of
paid
homage
to
blues
goalie
curtis
joseph
the
fans
began
bowing
their
arms
extended
taking
the
the
lead
from
a
fan
who
held
a
sign
that
read
only
god
saves
more
than
joseph
it
was
a
fitting
tribute
to
joseph
who
has
brought
the
blues
to
the
verge
of
a
surprising
sweep
joseph
recorded
his
second
successive
shutout
friday
blanking
the
blackhawks
in
game
of
the
norris
division
semifinals
and
giving
the
blues
a
lead
in
the
bestofseven
series
the
blackhawks
havent
scored
against
joseph
since
the
mark
of
the
second
period
of
game
joseph
has
shut
out
the
blackhawks
for
minutes
seconds
a
blues
record
jacques
plante
held
the
previous
record
of
set
in
the
first
round
of
the
playoffs
against
the
philadelphia
flyers
one
of
only
two
series
the
blues
have
sweeped
in
their
history
the
blues
can
wrap
up
their
first
sweep
since
with
a
victory
in
game
a
nationally
televised
game
that
begins
at
noon
sunday
the
blues
have
had
only
two
sweeps
in
franchise
history
both
in
when
they
swept
philadelphia
and
los
angeles
en
route
to
the
stanley
cup
finals
the
shutout
friday
was
easier
than
on
wednesday
in
game
when
joseph
had
to
make
saves
this
time
the
blues
held
the
shots
down
to
and
the
blackhawks
couldnt
touch
joseph
well
they
touched
joseph
numerous
times
shoving
him
and
pushing
him
at
every
opportunity
to
try
to
get
him
off
his
game
but
joseph
and
the
blues
were
unfazed
dishing
out
their
own
punishment
along
the
way
the
blues
grinders
bob
bassen
rich
sutter
kevin
miller
and
dave
lowry
wore
down
the
blackhawks
taking
the
visitors
from
chicago
off
their
game
the
grinders
set
the
stage
for
the
glamour
boys
the
gifted
playmakers
and
scorers
who
made
the
most
of
their
opportunities
craig
janney
brett
hull
and
nelson
emerson
scored
getting
one
goal
in
each
period
hull
assisted
on
janneys
firstperiod
power
play
goal
after
two
unwise
chicago
penalties
checker
miller
set
up
hulls
goal
in
the
second
period
and
rookie
denny
felsner
assisted
for
emerson
who
scored
at
of
the
final
period
blues
fans
jumped
to
their
feet
in
celebration
of
that
goal
and
began
yelling
sweep
sweep
sweep
they
also
taunted
chicago
goalie
ed
belfour
bellfour
bellfour
they
also
chanted
na
nanana
heyhey
good
bye
such
talk
is
a
tad
premature
theres
still
one
game
left
but
the
blues
are
on
a
roll
they
have
the
blackhawks
on
their
heels
the
blues
set
the
tone
early
on
friday
with
two
crunching
hits
in
the
first
minute
of
play
rich
sutter
leveled
bryan
marchment
and
brendan
shanahan
dumped
steve
smith
at
center
ice
chicago
tried
to
retaliate
but
troy
murrays
decision
to
run
into
joseph
backfired
referee
dan
marouelli
gave
him
a
roughing
penalty
the
blues
didnt
get
a
shot
on
goal
on
the
power
play
and
they
survived
a
scare
after
chicago
killed
the
penalty
when
rick
zombo
gave
the
puck
away
to
steve
larmer
joseph
stopped
larmers
shot
and
everything
else
chicago
threw
at
him
in
the
first
period
the
hawks
ignored
the
scouting
report
on
joseph
about
shooting
high
and
continued
to
shoot
low
where
josephs
butterfly
style
is
deadly
rookie
bret
hedican
picked
up
three
consecutive
penalties
midway
through
the
period
two
for
hooking
and
one
for
holding
but
chicago
got
only
two
shots
on
goal
as
many
as
miller
the
blues
penalty
killer
twice
stole
the
puck
and
just
missed
on
good
scoring
chances
against
belfour
marouelli
began
calling
penalties
on
the
blackhawks
to
even
things
up
he
caught
brent
sutter
hooking
shanahan
four
seconds
after
hedicans
third
penalty
he
called
marchment
for
elbowing
janney
along
the
boards
at
and
gave
the
blues
a
twoman
advantage
later
when
christian
ruuttu
slashed
shanahan
the
blues
worked
around
the
puck
on
the
ensuing
power
play
and
hull
got
it
where
he
likes
it
in
the
high
slot
hulls
shot
hit
belfours
right
shoulder
and
the
puck
bounced
precariously
close
to
the
goal
line
belfour
dived
back
to
cover
but
the
puck
squirted
loose
to
janney
who
poked
it
into
the
net
at
for
his
first
goal
of
the
playoffs
the
blues
continued
their
relentless
hitting
as
the
period
ended
and
the
blackhawks
lost
their
composure
joe
murphy
tripped
ron
wilson
with
two
seconds
remaining
in
the
period
and
after
time
had
expired
smith
upset
the
blues
by
shooting
the
puck
into
the
blues
bench
chris
chelios
made
a
move
toward
joseph
as
the
teams
left
the
ice
and
marouelli
slapped
him
with
a
misconduct
chicago
survived
the
blues
power
play
but
the
loss
of
chelios
hurt
he
didnt
return
until
the
midway
point
of
the
period
and
within
three
minutes
of
his
return
hull
had
increased
the
blues
lead
to
deflecting
in
millers
crisp
pass
try
as
they
might
the
blackhawks
couldnt
get
to
joseph
who
stopped
everything
they
could
throw
at
him
he
stopped
shots
in
the
second
period
and
more
in
the
third
chicago
also
hit
the
goalpost
twice
emersons
goal
put
the
game
away
he
went

the

a

they
will
be
playing
golf
sunday
when
they
gave
up
shots
in
the
last
two
periods
maybe
tommy
told
them
that
he
was
getting
bored
back
there
mark
recchi
opened
the
scoring
so
fast
that
if
you
blinked
you
missed
it
after
buffalo
won
the
faceoff
and
dumped
tommy
wrapped
the
puck
around
the
boards
to
eric
way
up
on
his
left
eric
dropped
it
to
galley
and
he
sent
it
ahead
to
recchi
steaming
out
of
the
zone
mark
skated
into
the
center
circle
passed
the
puck
to
himself
through
the
legs
of
richard
smehlik
skated
around
him
and
in
on
fuhr
smehlik
was
pulling
at
him
all
the
way
through
the
zone
with
his
stick
recchi
drifted
right
drifted
back
left
and
slid
the
puck
back
to
the
right
past
fuhr
for
a
flyers
lead
at
it
was
so
beautiful
eric
and
garry
should
turn
down
their
assists
the
flyers
kept
the
pressure
on
fuhr
for
a
while
after
that
but
he
was
strong
and
kept
the
flyers
from
doing
further
damage
the
game
then
became
a
defensive
struggle
for
a
while
the
sabres
got
the
first
chance
on
the
power
play
when
terry
carkner
took
a
boarding
minor
at
for
crunching
dale
hawerchuk
into
the
boards
in
the
flyers
zone
lafontaine
got
the
only
scoring
chance
and
not
a
terribly
good
one
as
the
flyers
smothered
the
sabres
power
play
mogilny
got
a
post
after
it
was
over
the
consecutive
penalty
kill
for
the
flyers
keith
carney
took
a
holding
penalty
at
for
taking
down
mark
recchi
to
give
the
flyers
a
power
play
the
best
penalty
killing
team
in
the
league
didnt
allow
the
flyers
a
shot
on
goal
although
the
flyers
did
create
a
good
scoring
chance
for
lindros
who
partially
fanned
on
his
shot
towards
the
end
of
the
period
the
play
started
going
end
to
end
but
everybody
kept
missing
the
net
greg
hawgood
took
an
interference
penalty
at
to
give
the
sabres
another
power
play
but
they
couldnt
get
anything
going
and
the
fans
expressed
their
displeasure
particularly
when
they
iced
the
puck
shots
were
buffalo
after
the
flyers
had
led
at
one
point
mike
emrick
interviewed
flyers
president
jay
snider
between
periods
jay
was
disappointed
to
not
make
the
playoffs
but
not
discouraged
this
was
considered
a
rebuilding
year
after
the
trade
and
he
seemed
very
happy
with
the
way
the
season
went
when
asked
if
he
agonized
over
the
trade
he
said
that
it
was
russ
farwells
trade
and
not
his
that
it
only
was
an
issue
for
him
and
ed
snider
as
far
as
the
money
but
yes
there
was
some
agonizing
and
theyd
do
it
all
over
again
when
asked
how
the
coaching
situation
would
be
handled
for
next
year
he
said
that
its
russ
call
and
russ
will
evaluate
things
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
feels
that
theyre
years
away
from
a
shot
at
the
cup
he
expects
to
get
into
the
playoffs
next
year
have
a
shot
at
a
division
title
the
following
year
and
a
shot
at
the
finals
the
year
after
that
this
based
on
the
current
level
of
play
and
anticipated
improvements
over
the
summer
hes
very
happy
with
the
realignment
he
called
it
outstanding
happy
with
the
current
expansion
feels
that
the
talent
pool
is
big
enough
with
the
unflux
of
europeans
but
feels
that
they
must
make
sure
existing
franchises
are
stable
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
playing
in
the
olympics
booo
but
said
that
there
was
a
definite
split
among
owners
and
that
this
certainly
would
only
happen
in
four
years
if
there
was
a
consensus
the
sabres
gave
the
flyers
their
second
power
play
of
the
game
when
brad
may
took
a
tripping
penalty
at
of
the
second
the
flyers
had
a
little
trouble
getting
started
but
eventually
did
hawgood
took
a
pass
as
he
was
moving
throug
the
neutral
zone
and
handed
the
puck
to
eklund
just
outside
the
sabres
blue
line
along
the
right
boards
eklund
carried
into
the
zone
nad
passed
across
to
dineen
who
tried
a
one
timer
from
between
the
blue
line
and
the
top
of
the
left
circle
he
half
fanned
on
it
and
sent
the
puck
trickling
through
the
slot
fuhr
didnt
know
where
it
was
though
and
hawgood
won
the
race
to
it
and
flipped
it
into
essentially
an
open
net
at
then
mogilny
on
a
breakaway
he
slipped
through
two
flyers
at
the
blue
line
and
went
in
on
soderstrom
he
went
with
the
backhander
but
soderstrom
was
all
over
it
the
flyers
then
took
some
bad
discipline
type
penalties
that
really
hurt
them
viacheslav
butsayev
took
a
double
minor
for
roughing
and
high
sticking
when
barnaby
got
under
his
skin
and
drew
one
minor
then
according
to
gary
dornhoefer
took
a
dive
to
get
the
other
there
was
no
video
at
the
sabres
coudlnt
get
started
ryan
mcgill
poked
at
the
puck
just
after
a
sabre
carried
into
the
flyers
zone
and
after
a
bunch
of
people
poked
at
it
dineen
emerged
with
it
and
headed
the
other
way
it
started
out
a
on
but
brindamour
hustled
ahead
to
make
it
a
on
and
back
off
the
defenseman
dineen
let
it
rip
from
the
top
of
the
right
circle
to
make
it
flyers
at
that
was
all
for
fuhr
john
muckler
sent
in
dominik
hasek
to
take
over
but
the
sabres
still
had
lots
of
power
play
time
again
they
took
some
time
to
just
get
into
the
flyers
zone
and
when
they
finally
did
the
flyers
were
all
over
them
boos
began
to
ring
through
the
building
but
they
finally
got
through
soderstrom
on
an
ugly
goal
smehlik
took
a
shot
from
the
top
of
the
zone
that
missed
and
kicked
out
to
hawerchuk
in
the
slot
hawerchuk
tried
a
backhander
as
he
skated
towards
the
goal
line
to
the
right
as
galley
dove
down
to
block
it
mistake
he
should
have
let
soderstrom
handle
the
backhander
and
worried
about
a
the
rebound
or
b
barnaby
who
was
camped
behind
the
goal
line
right
next
to
the
net
well
the
rebound
dropped
right
next
to
soderstrom
and
mistake
galley
just
laid
there
and
watched
barnaby
get
three
hacks
at
the
puck
before
he
finally
pushed
it
through
the
goalie
he
didnt
even
swing
his
stick
out
to
try
and
knock
the
puck
away
with
the
goal
at
two
streaks
end
for
the
flyers
of
shutout
hockey
and
straight
penalty
kills
lindros
put
them
right
back
on
the
power
play
at
with
a
high
sticking
minor
i
think
it
was
barnaby
again
this
time
the
sabres
were
able
to
get
set
up
quickly
but
couldnt
get
too
much
quality
on
goal
the
sabres
continued
to
keep
the
puck
in
the
flyers
end
for
a
while
after
the
power
play
ended
things
evetually
settled
down
but
then
the
other
very
bad
penalty
mcgill
allowed
barnaby
to
get
under
his
skin
and
slashed
his
stick
just
before
a
faceoff
the
gloves
were
dropped
and
mcgill
started
pounding
the
crap
out
of
him
but
during
the
fight
he
gave
barnaby
a
head
butt
with
his
helmet
and
that
meant
a
match
penalty
for
slashing
fighting
and
for
the
major
minutes
of
power
play
time
for
the
sabres
at
barnaby
only
got
the
flyers
were
keeping
them
at
bay
for
a
while
but
there
was
only
so
long
they
could
do
that
after
a
couple
of
good
sabre
chances
audette
handed
to
ledyard
at
the
point
and
ledyard
sent
a
drive
that
was
knocked
down
by
soderstrom
lafontaine
whacked
at
the
bouncing
puck
from
the
left
side
of
the
net
and
knocked
it
over
to
randy
wood
at
the
right
soderstrom
had
moved
over
to
play
lafontaine
and
since
yushkevich
and
carkner
were
waving
at
the
puck
instead
of
picking
up
men
wood
just
slid
it
into
the
empty
net
at
to
close
the
flyers
lead
to
lafontaine
was
actually
trying
to
put
it
on
net
but
half
fanned
on
it
and
got
a
break
the
flyers
then
got
some
shorthanded
pressure
in
the
sabres
zone
but
hasek
was
strong
finally
it
was
keith
carney
passing
ahead
to
hawerchuk
into
the
neutral
zone
and
hawerchuk
sent
a
good
backhand
pass
to
mogilny
at
the
flyers
blue
line
another
minibreakaway
for
mogilny
he
elected
to
shoot
from
the
left
circle
and
he
threaded
the
needle
to
get
it
just
inside
the
far
post
at
for
his
of
the
season
ironically
the
youth
hockey
tip
between
the
and
second
period
was
tommy
soderstrom
talking
about
cutting
off
angles
that
was
all
in
the
shots
were
sabres
into
the
period
and
pelle
eklund
blew
a
golden
opportunity
to
get
the
flyers
the
lead
back
a
on
acton
with
the
puck
he
dropped
to
eklund
in
the
slot
and
eklund
held
the
puck
as
he
slid
through
the
left
circle
until
he
had
almost
no
angle
at
all
to
shoot
from
when
he
finally
did
shoot
he
hit
the
far
post
that
was
still
during
the
carryover
power
play
time
than
an
incredible
almost
goal
randy
wood
skated
around
recchi
and
hawgood
untouched
into
soderstrom
soderstrom
goes
down
wood
pokes
the
puck
under
soderstrom
and
a
black
object
hits
the
back
of
the
net
red
light
comes
on
horn
sounds
crowd
cheers
but
up
to
the
video
replay
booth
for
some
strange
reason
and
in
the
meantime
emrick
and
dornhoefer
try
to
figure
out
what
they
could
be
reviewing
well
it
turns
out
that
it
was
the
taped
up
stick
blade
that
went
into
the
net
not
the
puck
emrick
mentions
that
one
of
the
criteria
for
scoring
a
goal
is
that
the
puck
must
go
into
the
net
dave
hannan
then
took
out
recchi
and
got
a
holding
minor
at
the
flyers
could
not
get
anything
going
at
all
they
finally
got
set
up
way
through
but
were
kept
on
the
perimeter
as
time
ran
out
beranek
stripped
the
puck
from
a
sabre
in
the
offensive
zone
along
the
right
boards
and
passed
it
across
to
eklund
at
the
top
of
the
left
circle
eklund
saw
dineen
heading
at
the
net
just
inside
the
right
circle
and
passed
through
to
him
dineen
fumbled
the
pass
but
twice
directed
it
at
hasek
and
eklund
swooped
in
and
chipped
the
bouncing
puck
over
the
goalie
for
his
at
flyers
but
the
sabres
came
right
back
lafontaine
picked
up
the
puck
in
his
offensive
left
corner
and
slid
it
to
bob
erry
behind
the
flyers
net
erry
started
to
skate
out
but
then
just
dropped
the
puck
back
to
nobody
behind
the
net
mogilny
flew
in
skated
around
and
stuffed
it
through
soderstroms
hole
for
his
at
to
tie
the
game
at
then
hawerchuk
took
a
retaliatory
roughing
penalty
at
the
flyers
set
up
in
the
sabres
zone
and
stayed
there
off
a
faceoff
high
in
the
sabres
zone
in
the
middle
while
brindamour
wrestled
for
the
puck
dineen
snuck
through
the
line
and
wristed
a
perfect
shot
low
to
haseks
glove
side
at
play
started
to
go
back
and
forth
until
hawgood
took
a
roughing
penalty
at
the
flyers
dumped
the
puck
into
the
sabres
zone
brindamour
and
ledyard
went
after
it
and
rod
got
the
puck
he
backed
away
from
the
right
boards
skated
to
the
right
faceoff
dot
and
passed
between
his
legs
to
dineen
crashing
through
the
slot
all
by
himself
dineen
waited
patiently
and
lifted
it
over
the
blocker
of
hasek
for
a
flyers
lead
at
hat
trick
of
the
season
for
dineen
of
his
career
shorthanded
goal
of
the
game
for
him
of
the
season
then
carney
took
a
tripping
penalty
at
to
kill
the
rest
of
the
sabres
power
play
not
much
action
on
the
on
and
the
sabres
got
most
of
the
chances
on
the
flyers
resulting
power
play
play
went
end
to
end
for
quite
a
while
after
that
and
both
goalies
had
to
make
some
big
saves
the
sabres
werent
able
to
pull
hasek
as
time
was
running
out
as
the
flyers
wouldnt
allow
any
consistant
possession
for
the
sabres
finally
as
time
was
running
out
ken
sutton
misplayed
the
puck
in
his
own
left
corner
and
brindamour
stripped
it
away
from
him
he
pulled
away
and
found
dineen
on
the
other
side
of
the
left
circle
and
dineen
found
acton
at
the
right
of
hasek
he
slid
the
puck
between
two
sabres
defenders
and
acton
chipped
it
back
to
the
far
side
of
hasek
for
his
of
the
season
at
on
his
birthday
that
was
all
the
scoring
shots
were
buffalo
and
the
ice
was
showered
with
plastic
drinking
mugs
handed
out
before
the
game
so
another
strong
game
from
tommy
soderstrom
who
hadnt
been
tested
much
in
his
last
couple
of
starts
kevin
dineen
has
a
career
high
point
night
unless
he
had
a
better
night
earlier
in
the
season
but
i
dont
think
so
the
flyers
longest
winning
streak
in
years
goals
for
only
against
with
three
shutouts
eric
lindros
is
in
league
with
even
strength
goals
despite
missing
games
with
injury
points
out
of
clinched
place
since
the
rangers
lose
the
tie
breaker
a
couple
misc
notes
forget
the
mike
keenan
rumors
there
will
be
a
press
conference
tommorrow
to
announce
that
he
will
be
head
coach
of
the
new
york
rangers
next
year
in
the
last
notes
i
mentioned
that
garry
galley
won
the
barry
ashbee
award
but
i
failed
to
mention
that
the
award
is
for
the
best
defenseman
the
times
of
trenton
has
reported
that
a
preeminent
specialist
from
oklahoma
has
looked
over
tommy
soderstroms
medical
record
and
determined
that
no
further
tests
are
necessary
in
the
near
future
same
paper
had
a
blurb
about
bill
dineen
being
asked
about
whether
or
not
he
expected
to
be
back
next
year
his
response
was
that
he
wants
to
come
back
he
feels
he
did
a
good
job
this
year
but
that
he
would
cheerfully
accept
a
role
scouting
if
farwell
didnt
want

grade
i
b
it
is
way
too
early
to
tell
about
ahola
who
was
acquired
probably
because
the
penguins
figured
that
they
would
lose
him
in
the
expansion
draft
ahola
had
only
played
games
this
season
i
think
its
actually
less
the
san
jose
mercury
news
may
be
in
err
here
of
them
with
the
sharks
in
the
games
he
has
played
he
appeared
quite
solid
defensively
although
he
hasnt
been
spectacular
and
his
offense
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
points
its
even
possible
that
the
trade
may
be
for
future
considerations
which
turn
out
to
be
peter
ahola
doug
wilson
season
acquired
trade
with
chicago
for
rw
kerry
toporowski
and
round
pick
in
entry
draft
grade
i
b
i
have
often
been
accused
of
overly
down
on
wilson
i
may
have
had
too
high
expectations
for
him
but
his
legs
knees
et
al
are
giving
out
nevertheless
when
he
was
playing
he
exhibited
a
strong
shooting
and
playmaking
abilities
even
if
he
has
lost
a
step
on
defense
which
unfortunately
he
demonstrated
this
year
as
well
as
at
times
he
was
slow
to
catch
the
opponent
forwards
and
his
offensive
output
was
only
good
enough
for
place
on
the
team
points
in
games
but
next
year
which
may
be
wilsons
last
if
he
can
stay
healthy
he
can
still
be
a
contributor
dean
kolstad
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
cd
its
probably
somewhat
unfair
for
me
to
judge
kolstad
on
just
a
handful
of
games
forgetting
exact
number
but
no
more
than
but
at
age
hes
quickly
running
out
of
time
if
he
wants
to
make
it
to
the
nhl
in
those
games
he
did
not
impress
anyone
after
generating
shots
in
the
first
period
of
the
first
game
he
played
he
scored
just
points
in
his
tenure
up
here
with
the
sharks
and
was
even
less
impressive
defensively
as
he
appeared
awkward
with
his
movement
and
was
prone
to
giveaways
he
needs
to
make
a
leap
in
his
level
of
performance
to
have
any
chance
of
making
the
team
pat
macleod
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
macleod
was
on
the
roster
a
lot
longer
than
kolstad
but
it
appears
to
my
memory
that
he
played
less
than
kolstad
because
the
sharks
were
reluctant
to
use
him
but
were
even
more
reluctant
to
send
him
to
the
minors
figuring
that
he
wouldnt
clear
waivers
in
fact
he
has
played
the
past
weeks
with
kansas
city
but
is
still
technically
there
on
a
rehabilitation
assignment
a
rehab
assignment
that
will
include
him
playing
in
the
turner
cup
playoffs
since
he
has
played
so
little
i
cant
even
give
a
tentative
grade
on
him
but
he
demonstrated
last
year
excellent
offensive
skills
but
terrible
defensive
skills
tom
pederson
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
b
called
up
in
the
middle
of
the
season
when
the
defensive
corps
was
decimated
by
injuries
pederson
impressed
many
sharks
fan
here
on
net
including
yours
truly
he
demonstrated
very
good
offensive
skills
scoring
points
in
games
however
his
size
lbs
is
of
concern
and
soon
after
he
began
to
shine
offensive
did
teams
begin
to
push
him
around
physically
on
both
sides
of
the
ice
although
he
had
appeared
fearless
in
his
approach
but
to
be
successful
he
probably
needs
to
bulk
up
to
have
a
fighting
chance
on
surviving
against
some
of
the
bigger
players
in
the
league
claudio
scremin
season
acquired
from
minnesota
in
dispersal
draft
grade
i
dd
he
played
all
of
games
in
the
league
this
year
but
was
thoroughly
umimpressive
just
as
he
was
at
the
end
of
last
season
again
it
may
be
a
small
sample
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
kolstad
scremin
at
age
is
quickly
running
out
of
time
he
was
not
a
contributor
on
either
offense
or
defense
in
the
games
he
played
with
the
sharks
the
only
notable
thing
that
will
go
down
in
scremins
entry
of
league
stats
is
probably
the
fact
that
he
was
once
traded

during

pocklington
may

it

edmonton
northlands
to
renegotiate
the

lease
on

northlands
has
offered
to
buy
the
oilers
for
million
earlier
but
the
offer
was
rejected
immediately
by
pocklington
as
for
me
my
opinion
is
divided
edmonton
has
been
fairly
supportive
of
the
oilers
even
though
theyre
a
small
market
team
they
had
many
sellouts
in
the
even
with
the
problems
that
the
team
had
this
year
they
still
brought
in
more
fans
than
many
teams
in
larger
cities
did
on
the
other
hand
if
the
team
does
move
there
is
no
place
more
deserving
than
hamilton
of
course
how
would
that
affect
the
grand
realignment
scheme
of
bettman
following
up
on
this
the
provincial
government
has
been
asked
by
the
opposition
to
block
any
deal
that
pocklington
is
offering
to
hamilton
the
government
said
that
pock
is
going
nowhere
why
dont

i
prefer
to
watch
hockey
than
seeing
shots
of
felix
potvin
slashing
and
spearing
dino
ciccerelli
standing
in
front
of
the
net
he
has
every
right
to
stand
in
front
of
the
net
just
not
in
the
crease
yes
he
does
but
the
goalie
sure
as
hell
doesnt
want
him
there
when
i
played
roller
hockey
boy
do
i
miss
those
days
as
a
goalie
i
would
scream
at
my
defense
to
clear
guys
out
of
the
slot
i
dont
care
if
hes
in
the
crease
or
not
get
him
the
hell
away
from
me
so
i
can
see
the
ball
yes
roller
hockey
remember
and
if
there
was
nobody
around
to
clear
the
slot
then
id
do
it
myself
by
pushing
the
offending
playerhard
i
hate
people
in
my
way
when
im
the
goalie
and
i
am
sure
felix
does
too
i
should
say
that
i
didnt
see
the
incident
so
if
potvin
really
swung
the
stick
big
time
then
thats
not
right
but
he
can
move
people
out
of
the
way
hes
a
player
on
the
ice
too
you
know
keith

corner
lets
go
quakers
weighing
in
at
almost
every
weight
imaginable
life
and
all
that
surrounds
it
blues
traveler
i
have
to
agree
wholeheartedly
with
this
view
i
dont
like
to
see
stickwork
but
you
have
to
clear
players
away
from
in
front
my
personal
favorite
move
im
a
goalie
too
is
to
give
the
offeding
player
a
good
whack
on
the
back
of
their
skates
when
the
ref
isnt
looking
makes
em
go
down
like
a
ton
of
bricks
but
doesnt
cause
injuries
unless
they
dont
know
how
to
fall
im
talking
about
hitting
the
blades
here
not
the
foot
it
also
makes
the
player
you
hit
and
anyone
who
sees
really
mad
and
apt
to
take
a
stupid
retaliation
penalty
unfortunately
it
also
leaves
your
blocker
out
of
position
for
a
short
timei
dont
do
this
if
a
shot
is
likely
on
the
short
side
hmmmaybe
i
should
mail
potvin
this
method
in
french
and
with
helpful
diagrams
of
course
it
sure
would
be
nice
to
see
ciccerelli
who
i
have
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
btw
hes
not
a
big
guy
but
he
plays

going

campbell
games
in

first
two
rounds
as
those
series
wear
on
games
or
perhaps
games
ive
heard
that
this
is
because
most
of
their
market
is
east
coast
and
hence
would
prefer
the
wales
stuff
also
dont
expect
canadian
teams
on

in

if
you
want
to
see
a
network
that
provides
good
hockey
coverage
watch
cbc
from
canada
they
may
be
biased
toward
canadian
teams
but
they
dont
treat
the
viewers
like
idiots
they
provide
nice

mike

formerly

has
just

the

have

just
a

at

are

the

are

decision

were
very
interested

according

over

should
the

win

the

will
have

the

this
is
because
the

have
won

the

on
the

bugs
bunny
foghorn
leghorn
and
yosemite
sam
who
don
called
lanny
macdonald
ron
maclean
began
by
mentioning
that
don
was
almost
evicted
from
a
hotel
where
he
was
watching
the
previous
nights
games
because
of
all
the
yelling
and
cheering
he
was
doing
over
the
play
of
hunter
and
fuhr
don
began
to
praise
fuhr
calling
him
the
greatest
goalie
and
said
that
hes
winning
the
series
against
boston
all
by
himself
he
then
showed
clips
from
earlier
episodes
nov
jan
when
fuhr
was
still
with
the
leafs
and
don
advised
dont
trade
fuhr
don
went
on
to
predict
that
if
buffalo
gets
by
boston
it
would
be
fuhr
who
wins
the
series
muckler
took
a
lot
of
heat
for
the
trade
but
don
feels
mucklers
been
vindicated
the
next
topic
involved
how
playoff
games
are
being
ruined
by
too
many
penalty
calls
he
showed
a
clip
from
a
winnipegvancouver
game
where
domi
hit
a
vancouver
player
and
was
given
a
min
penalty
ron
said
that
it
was
called
a
penalty
because
his
stick
was
involved
but
don
stuck
with
the
opinion
that
it
was
a
good
hit
with
domi
hitting
the
vancouver
player
with
his
shoulder
don
its
sad
what
theyre
doing
for
hockey
a
minute
penalty
for
a
nosebleed
next
they
went
to
the
playoff
series
between
detroit
and
toronto
people
in
detroit
were
calling
wendel
clarke
wendy
for
not
fighting
however
don
pointed
out
that
probert
was
not
fighting
either
this
lead
don
into
a
tirad
about
fighting
and
stickwork
and
how
banning
fighting
leads
to
more
high
sticking
its
like
college
hockey
the
little
wee
guy
with
the
visor
is
brave
as
anybody
thats
why
youre
seeing
so
much
stickwork
because
they
know
you
wont
drop
your
gloves
and
give
them
a
shot
the
rules
are
made
by
people
who
dont
know
whats
going
on
in
hockey
the
final
topic
don
discussed
was
dale
hunter
don
pointed
out
that
he
was
leading
the
league
in
goals
and
showed
a
clip
of
hunter
from
a
previous
game
when
he
was
younger
hunter
was
taught
to
play
to
win
which
differs
from
todays
idea
of
just
letting
kids
have
fun
at
then
end
of
the
episode
they
showed
a
clip
from
a
coachs
corner
with
the
tape
on
fast
forward
so
that
don
sounded
like
one
of
the
chipmunks
rating
typical
antifighting
posturing
not
too
much
humour
but
some
good

summary
once
again
the
episode
started
with
a
shot
of
dons
tie
this
was
a
different
tie
than
last
time
don
pointed
out
some
of
the
characters
on
the
tie
but
gave
them
different
names
felix
the
cat
sylverster
maclean
daffy
duck
etc
ron
maclean
asked
don
what
he
thought
of
the
current
wingsleafs
game
don
thought
it
was
good
burns
told
the
leaf
players
they
won
in
their
building
were
going
to
win
in
ours
don
then
began
to
praise
gilmour
again
don
pointed
out
that
gilmour
has
never
got
less
than
points
or
a
goal
in
any
game
since
he
got
points
in
a
game
against
st
louis
don
also
claims
that
he
gave
a
lot
of
encouragement
to
gilmour
which
was
partly
responsible
for
his
good
play
several
clips
were
then
shown
of
gilmour
from
the
series
a
hit
on
constantinov
and
a
pass
to
andrewchuk
resulting
in
a
goal
on
the
game
itself
the
wings
were
taking
a
lot
of
penalties
in
the
first
period
the
wings
have
enough
talent
to
score
short
handed
however
and
when
the

murray
makes
the
following
statements
players
dont
fight
because
theyre
afraid
of
getting
thrown
out
of
the
game
as
instigator
instead
they
settle
grudges
by
getting
their
sticks
and
slicing
each
other
is
this
what
the
fans
want
to
see
i
guarantee
there
wouldnt
be
as
many
slashes
if
fighting
were
kept
in
the
game
don
warned

commisioner

the
thing
that
confuses
me
most
about
espn
is
that
they
decided
to
show
the
penguins
and
devils
again
on
thursday
night
being
that
both
of
the
first
two
games
were
dominated
by
pitt
you
would
think
that
they
would
show
a
different
game
this
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
they
should
show
other
games
just
for
the
sake
of
fair
exposure
also
some
of
you
should
know
that
as
far
as
i
can
tell
espn
is
not
going
to
show
campbell
conference
games
regularly
in
the
first
two
rounds
i
believe
that
they
are
only
going
to
show
campbell
games
in
the
first
two
rounds
as
those
series
wear
on
games
or
perhaps
games
also
does
anyone
have
info
on
abc

sunday
espn

i
dont
know
what
the
hell
they

trying

do
especially
against
nfl

guess
there
goes
the

i
think
the
threeheaded
gms
guiding
principle
was
to
keep
veterans
in
favor
of
youngsters
only
if
they
offered
a
significant
advantage
doesnt
sound
like
a
bad
strategy
to
me
no
and
in
fact
that
was
ferreiras
original
strategy
which
the
troika
proceeded
to
simply
continue
to
implement
there
wasnt
exactly
a
radical
shift
in
policy
when
he
was
ousted
something
people
seem
to
forget
the
only
real
question
is
whether
they
did
it
as
well
as
ferreira
could
have
if
he
stayed
or
whether
the
basic
strategy
was
flawed
since
ferreira
has
been
quoated
as
saying
hes
going
to
do
something
different
in
anaheim
with
the
ducks
my
guess
is
that
it
wasnt
as
good
in
practice
as
it
was
on
paper
and
hes
tweaking
it
a
bit
second
time
around
one
also
has
to
wonder
whether
the
strategy
would
have
been
a
lot
better
if
we
hadnt
had
those
injuries
and
whether
were
complaining
about
the
weather
because
an
earthquake
collapsed
the
root
cellar
of
course
ferreira
had
also
traded
a
number
of
veterans
with
marginal
contributions
before
he
was
fired
so
its
not
clear
that
this
would
have
been
different
besides
they
were
marginal
contributors
lets
also
not
forget
that
ferreira
came
this
close
to
trading
kelly
kisio
which
if
the
rumors
ive
heard
are
true
was
over
the
strong
objections
of
other
aspects
of
shark
management
and
probably
had
a
lot
to
do
with
both
his
ouster
and
the
threeheaded
consensus
oriented
gm
imagine
for
a
second
where
the
sharks
would
be
today
if
that
fax
machine
hadnt
jammed
with
or
without
mullen
they
werent
going
to
be
a
playoff
team
what
good
does
it
do
them
to
hang
onto
a
player
whod
rather
be
elsewhere
especially
an
unhappy
player
that
isnt
playing
as
well
because
of
it
not
that
id
accuse
mullen
of
tanking
but
his
motivation
simply
wasnt
there
and
that
kind
of
thing
can
affect
the
team
an
example
from
this
season
skriko
was
brought
in
on
a
trial
basis
but
not
kept
because
of
his
age
i
thought
he
was
a
decent
contributor
worth
keeping
around
the
youth
movement
has
its
advantages
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veterans
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balance
right
balance
for
what
thats
the
issue
exactly
at
the
time
they
let
skriko
go
we
hadnt
yet
had
the
major
injury
bugs
that
killed
us
later
id
much
rather
have
skriko
around
than
someone
like
dean
kolstad
but
at
that
point
that
wasnt
the
choice
and
since
the
choice
was
more
one
of
skriko
vs
someone
like
john
carter
i
think
the
right
choice
was
made
for
that
time

nothing

he
is
one
of

working
rangers
check
that
the
hardest
working
ranger
he
had
goals
this
year
not
bad
for
a
checking
type
of
player
and
showed
up
for
every
single
game
this
season
unlike
that
stiff
messier
he
is
fearless
and
throws
clean
checks
he
will
also
stand
up
to
someone
after
he
hits
them
not
like
that
pussy
oaf
exactly
my
point
if
youd
watch
games
more
closely
youd
see
a
lot
of
goons
going
after
him
ulf
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
less
physical
players
for
pgh
are
left
alone
ulf
plays
rough
hockey
but
only
when
other
players
are
putting
the
rush
on
mario
or
jagr
if
you
want
to
say
anyone
on
the
penguins
is
a
cheap
shot
or
a
goon
say
its
jennings
or
caufield
dontslander
a
good
defenseman
because
your
favorite
players
cant
beat
the
pens
even
when
they
take
dives
like
gartner
to
try
for
the
cheap
penalties
as
for
his
slash
of
lemieux
fine
it
was
a
cheap
shot
it
is
the
exception
not
the
rule
i
bet
you
think
mike
gartner
is
a
goon
because
of
the
time
that
he
slashed
the
hell
out
of
oafs
arm
last
year
right
after
all
he
did
get
a
suspension
for
it
hey
thats
fine
if
a
player
does
something
stupid
he
should
be
penalized
including
ulf
or
mario
youre
not
likely
to
see
that
happen
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
its
pointless
to
say
any
one
person
is

youll

need

right

too
many
of

get
away
with

the

i
can

thefrustration
that
you
feel
the
problem
is
that
other
americans
dont
give
a

they
view
it
as
a

of
canadians
with
bad

you

i
feel
that

a

guys
what
really
irritated
me
was
that
they
kept
switching
back

between
baseball
and

after
they
stated
that
they
couldnt
show
the
overtime
period
i
turned
back
to
espn
around
and
it
was
hockey
great
i
pulled
up
a
chair
and
watched
then
the
first
overtime
period
ended
and
they
went
back
to
baseball
before
coming
back
to
hockey
something
like
minutes
later
are
they
trying
to
alienate
both
hockey
and
baseball
viewers
at
the
same
time
as
for
martinsville
i
wonder
why
they
even
bothered
to

it
was

wood
played
most
of
his
junior
career
in
seattle
he
was
one
of
the
leading
scorers
on
a
mediocre
team
when
he
was
traded
away
in
he
rarely
lost
a
fight
and
was
one
of
the
toughest
players
in
the
whl
wood
is
fairly
small
for
an
enforcertype
i
mean
fleury
does
a
pretty
good
job
and
isnt
that
large
but
dody
is
no
fleury
having
been
witness
to
three
or
four
of
his
fights
closeup
he
simply
isnt
ready
to
fight
at
an
nhl
level
assuming
that
its
his
role
which
is
all
he
really
showed
us
in
his
few
games
up
from
kc
if
he
can
pass
shoot
or
skate
i
never
saw
much
of
it
all
he
has
is
a
right
fist
which
isnt
bad
but
at
the
nhl
level
the
other
players
are
smart
enough
to
grab
the
thing
before
he
can
land
anything
significant
once
you
control
that
hand
hes
a
fish
flopping
on
the
beach
and
the
other
player
can
do
just
about
anything
he
wants
to
him
his
entire
strategy
seemed
to
be
keep
the
hand
out
of
reach
until
he
found
an
opening
and
i
never
once
saw
him
find
an
opening
worth
talking
about
he
got
neutralized
quickly
and
stomped
on
a
couple
of
times
unless
he
shows
some
new
tricks
in
camp

list

this
was
his

gave
it
to

so
hed
know
what
hed
have
to
work
on

he
needs
to
get
stronger
he
needs
to
get
more
speed

he
needs
to
show
some

it

are

is
this
due
to
their

getting
bigger
so
they
cover
more
their

eg
seem

bigger

than

revealed
is
your
own
you
dont
like
gretzky
big
deal
now
my
only
complaint
about
lemieux
is
that
he
dives
too
much
but
last
year
patrick
convinced
him
twice
to
accept
bowman
and
hockey
destiny
rather
than
his
ego
the
real
purpose
of
diving
is
not
merely
an
attempt
to
draw
a
penalty
what
the
player
is
trying
to
do
is
make
the
checkers
keep
their
distance
so
the
ref
wont
be
fooled
i
cant
imagine
why
anyone
would
expect
someone
like
lemieux
to
change
his
game
why
dont
you
pick
on
dimensional
overrated
type
like
hull
and
salami

about
the

about
the
recent
pens
massacre
of

actually
i
am
bit
puzzled
too
and
a

relieved
however
i
am
going
to
put
an
end
to
nonpittsburghers
relief
with
a
bit
of
praise
for
the
pens
man
they
are
killing
those
devils
worse

i
thought
jagr
just
showed
you

he
is
much
better
than
his

stats
he
is

bowman
should
let

have
a

writes
by
the
way
i
am
canadian
play
a
little
and
watched
hockey
night
in
canada
never
missed
a
show
well
thats
really
great
pat
i
guess
since
youve
played
a
little
you
thereby
qualify
as
an
expert
especially
since
you
watch
all
the
games
on
tv
all
that
qualifies
you
as
is
a
armchair
quarterback
or
a
coach
potato
not
that
i
condone
violence

ill
make
an
exception
for
mario
pat
walker
again
just
further
evidence
as
to
what
kind
of
an
expert
you
are
truly
a
stupid
statement
mario
is
definately
one
of
the
best
players
to
play
the
game
im
not
saying
he
is
the
best
to
ever
play
the
game
but
he
should
come
to
mind
when
that
question
is
asked
lets
face
it
he
just
returns
from
radiation
therapy
with
around
a
dozen
games
left
overtakes
lafontaine
for
the
scoring
lead
and
then
buries
him
no
i
guess
he
just
got
lucky
speaking
of
lafontaine
now
theres
a
guy
who
should
be
considered
for
the
hart
trophy
as
well
certainly
one
of
the
better
players
in

ive
been
under
the

that
minnesota
was
one
of

possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
as
much
as
id
like
to
see

only

celio
came
in
alone
with
soderstrom
and
beat
tommy
to

the

mistakes
as
howald
was
allowed
to
skate
in

put

to

howald
entered

zone
slammed
on

breaks
and
his
shot
went
in
by
tommys
far
post
one
of
the
lousiest
periods
ive
seen
sweden
play
this
year
second
period
saw
a
new
swedish
team
and
the
swiss
had
to
ice
the
puck
many
times
on
a
pp
nylander
skated
in
from
the
boards
pavoni
made
the
initial
save
but
peter
andersson
scored
on
the
rebound
then
a
power
play
goal
from
the
swiss
a
slap
shot
from
the
blue
line
hit
two
players
on
the
way
to
the
goal
and
past
soderstrom
also
jonas
bergqvist
made
it
after
a
nice
pass
from
naslund
behind
the
goal
jan
larsson
reduced
the
lead
to
just
before
the
end
of
period
on
a
pp
skated
in
unattacked
in
front
of
the
goal
and
put
the
puck
through
pavonis
third
period
sweden
equalized
on
a
slap
shot
from
renberg
that
trickled
through
pavonis
then
another
defensive
mistake
by
the
swedes
waeger
was
allowed
to
skate
around
the
swedish
goal
unattacked
and
from
close
range
could
make
it
hollenstein

scored
on
a

took

and
dineen
just

past
trefilov

a

eric

trefilov
russia
won
the
shots
in

first

and
they
had
the
most
of

opportunities
but
they
just
couldnt

second
period
saw
lindros
scoring
his
goal
of

kariya
entered

slammed
on

to

then
made

just

on

to
deflect
it
to
lindros
who
onetimed
the

the

then
finally
got

and
made
a

shot
in
tugnutts
top
right
hand
corner
player

in
canada
was
voted
paul
kariya
and
for

valeri
karpov
i
agree
the
difference
in
this
game
was
lindros
and
kariya
and
in
part
also
tugnutt
kariya
had
a
far
better
game
now
than
vs
the
swedes
and
he
was
very
impressive
kariya
got
the
place
in
the
line
with
lindros
after
mike
gartner
went
out
with
a
ribinjury
early
in
the
first

lindros
btw
lead
the
point
scoring
with
pts
before
this

pts
ahead
of

double

as

an

at
of
the
third
conacher
this
is
not
an
official
game
report
just
my
observations
from
the
stands
melrose
made
a
wise
decision
and
put
stauber
back
in
goal
robb
had
something
to
prove
and
he
did
in
stopping
of
while
facing
a
fierce
calgary
attack
there
were
numerous
highlight
film
saves
kings
third
and
fourth
lines
rose
to
the
occasion
playing
rough
while
avoiding
bad
penalties
warren
rychel
scored
the
gamewinner
early
in
the
second
period
rookie
defenseman
alexi
zhitnik
scored
the
first
from
the
blue
line
late
in
the
first
dave
taylor
is
awesome
he
suffered
a
broken
nose
partway
through
the
second
pariod
checked
from
behind
into
the
boards
by
roberts
who
got
and
a
game
he
came
back
late
in
the
third
and
was
on
the
ice
when
conacher
scored
the
empty
netter
actually
it
was
in
the
third
period
his
return
did
bring
a
spark
to
the
crowd
and
to
the
players
who
played
awesome
defense
in
the
third
the
kings
goto
guys
still
are
not
producing
no
goals
from
kurri
granato
sandstrom
or
robitaille
who
have
a
total
of
points
between
them
you
forgot
about
gretzky
if
any
of
these
guys
start
scoring
the
kings
will
be
unstoppable
if
they
continue
the
great
defensive
work
as
well
mccreary
sucks
he
called
mcsorely
for
high
sticking
someone
who
was
already
on
the
ice
and
sandstrom
for
high
sticking
when
he
himself
was
already
on
the
ice
he
missed
many
flagrant
stick
penalties
including
one
from
flame
goalie
jeff
reese
who
followed
granato
out
to
almost
the
blue
line
where
he
crosschecked
him
he
called
the
game
very
inconsistently
with
a
series
of
tickytack
penalties
in
the
first
and
almost
none
in
the
third
cant
the
nhl
supply
decent
officiating
i
was
sitting
directly
across
the
ice
from
ron
and
nancy
reagan
when
the
empty
netter
was
scored
nancy
leapt
out
of
her
seat
with
both
fists
high
in
the
air
way
to
go
nancy
this
series
is
still
too
close
to
call
tuesdays
game
may
be
the
deciding
one
i
expect
king
might
put
vernon
back
in
even
though
reese
had
two
good
games
in
la
reese
has
historically
been
good
in
la
this
was
only
the
second
time
he
lost
there
this
move
would
be
good
for
the
kings
since
vernon
is
such
a
sieve
i
am
sure
that
stauber
will
get
the
call
for
the
kings
stauber
will
be
in
net
on
tuesday
hopefully
he
will
provide
another
stellar
performance
and
earn
the
name
robb
stopper
stauber
the
firswt
two
lines
of
the
kings
have
to
wake
up
while
it
is
great
to
see
you
cannot
depend
on
pat
conacher
and
warren
rychel
for
all
of
your
offense
i
expect
sandstrom
granato
and
gretzky
might
be
put
back
together
on
a
line
like
they
were
early
in
the
season
this
would
leave
kurri
carson
and
luc
as
the
second
on
paper
these
two
lines
look
powerful
lets
see
if
they
can
make
it
real
i
believe
this
is
how
they
arei
know
it
is
gretzky
and
sandstrom
but
he
has
been
putting
a
number
of
people
on
left
also
the
carson
robataille
kurri
line
once
ignited
will
light
the
fire
of
the
other
lines
hopefully
go
kings
dvb
it
is
evident
that
the
scoring
drought
is
getting
to
luc
after
his
slight
breakaway
in
the
third
i
think
he
was
steamed
on
the
bench
this
emotion
might
help
him
break
his
streak
also
i
have
noticed
blake
has
had
a
few
really
good
chances
to
score
but
has
fanned
or
shot
wide
is
the
injury
still
affecting
him

i

it

i

she

unfortunately

i

i

didnt
i
you
do
not

by
any
standard
you
care
to
use
to
define

people
constitutes
nothing
more
than
a
tiny

and
is
in
no
way
representative

let
alone
of
one
of
the
largest

in

the
largest

phrase
is
a
definition
of
the

not
a

as
a
whole
that
she
claims
to
represent
as
for
the
business
of
whether

not
it

it
is
large
compared
to

the

him
for
changing
the

at

to
this
point
and
just
for
my
own
curiosity
i
thought
id
look
up
the
official
definition
of
large
in
the
dictionary
it
reads
large
having
more
than
usual
power
capacity

exceeding
most

a

set

remember
the

were

in

the

i

thats
a
good
approach
they
tried
to
sign
sergei

before
this

because
makarov
wouldnt
have
required
compensation
matching
the
makarov
offer
was
the
only
real
mistake
dave
king
has
made
this

i
have
to
wonder
about
the
intelligence
of
signing
a
old
who
is
obviously
on
the
downside
of
his
career
to
a
million

risebrough
matched
the

makarov
has
spent
the
last
quarter
of

in

his

just
plain
stinks
not

hes
lost
a
step
and
can
no

get
himself
into
position

make
the
nifty
passes
i
think
makarov
will
be
available
for
free
this
offseason
to
anybody
who
agrees
to
pay
his
contract
hes
ineffective
in
calgary
but
he
might
be
able
to
help
a
team
like
san
jose
with
their
shortage
of
talent
if
theres
no
takers
and
makarov
doesnt
show
improvement
in

camp
i
think
the
flames
will
just
bite
the
bullet
and
buy
out
makarovs

release

he

have
never

yes
it
looks

i

the

is

its

that

besides
they
were

lets
also
not

that
ferreira
came
this
close
to
trading
kelly
kisio
which
if
the
rumors
ive
heard
are
true
was
over
the
strong
objections
of
other
aspects
of

management
and
probably
had
a

to

his

then
again
we

lets
say
that
in

view
of
the

upper
management
the
attempt
to
trade
kisio
was
a
major
factor
in
the
decision
to
fire

im

to
take
exactly
the

view
they

by
the
way
i
am
canadian
play
a
little
and
watched
hockey
night
in
canada
never
missed
a
show
not
one
of
these
well
a
my
home
team
is
in
the
finals
and
i
was
a
hockey
fan
for
ten
minutes
now
give
me
a
fking
break
with
this
mario
is
the
best
player
ever
what
did
gretzky
die
i
wish
bobby
clarke
and
the
broadstreet
bullies
were
still
around
theyd
know
what
to
do
with
a
whouse
like
mario
theyd
bounce
him
around
like
the
puck
not
that
i
condone
violence
but
ill
make
an
exception
for
mario
but
if
mario
is
going
to
complain
about
being
hit
someone
should
give
him
and
scotty
something
real
to
complain
about
sorry
to
ramble
as
you
can
see
i
hate
mario
pat
walker
unb
you
along
with
mario
lemieux
must
be
from
another
planet
the
only
difference
is
that
lemieux
comes
from
the
one
with
geo
washington
abe
lincoln
and
many
other
great
men
and
women
of
this
world
whereas
you
come
from
the
one
with
david
koresh
yeah
mario
is
good
at
drawing
penalties
but
wouldnt
you
try
do
something
you
do
claim
to
play
to
give
your
team
an
advantage
i
dont
remember
lemieux
getting
any
diving
penalties
this
year
whereas
many
others
did
finally
mario
has
never
complained
about
being
hit
he
knows
its
part
of
the
game
he
gets
back
by
dishing
out
an
even
bigger
hit
to
the
same
guy
or
just
scoring
a
few
goals
or
setting
them
up
dont
you
have
any

has
gone

the

been
as
quiet

a

on
many

this
year
too
many
of
us
just
take
winning
for

its
been
seemingly
forever
since
the
team
lost
and
weve
forgotten
what
its
like
to
feel
real
excitement
and
surprise
at
victory
i
dont
really
agree
with
this
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
high
at
any
rate
the
first
cup
the
pens
won
i
didnt
think
about
anything
else
i
just
watched
mario
and
all
skate
the
thing
around
the
ice
now
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
question
whether
or
not
thirty
years
from
now
young
hockey
fans
may
there
be
millions
will
still
ask
us
what
it
was
like
to
watch
this
team
thats
what
they
are
playing
for
now
but
i
was
still
as
nervous
as
ever
when
the
devils
were
blasting
shots
at
barrasso
in
the
final
seconds
of
game
three
so
the
fun
is
far
from
over
yet
im
not
bored
either
most
people
i
know
say
that
winning
the
second
cup
was
better
than
the
first
but
to
me
nothing
will
ever
top
that
first
one
but
im
every
bit
as
excited
this
year
and
i
am
experiencing
that
inner
calm
to
which
susan
originally
referred
inner
calm
is
not
boredom
as
far
as
the
arena
in
general
being
boring
well
richards
got
that
right
its
been
that
way
all
season
i
attribute
it
to
a
lot
of
new
fans
who
just
dont
have
the
same
spirit
and
knowledge
as
longtime
fans
at
last
tuesdays
game
i
overheard
a
man
express
surprise
that
a
goaltender
can
get
an
assist
anyone
who
follows
sports
with
regularity
knows
that
anything
can
happen
at
any
time
im
confident
in
the
pens
but
im
also
not
stupid
enough
to
think
for
one
minute
that
its
impossible
for
new
jersey
to
blow
them
out

i
doubt
that
will
happen

its
possible
bored
uhuh
spoiled
not
in

forgot
what
excitement
is
like
living
through
that
amazing
streak
wasnt
exciting
i
dont
take
a
darned
thing
for

god
look
at
chicago
and
i
see
no
problem
with
quietly
savoring
all

it
isnt

would

be

him
given
his

hes
still

i
dont
consider
him
a

by
any

at

its
also
possible
that
the

are
posturing
to
try

bring
down

imo
i
would
take

he
should

daigle
didnt

this

san

will
then
get
kariya
no
kariya
wont
go
in

for

very
simple
reason
hes
not
leaving
college

i
dont

any

there
is
equally

almost

available
that

san

seems
to
be
leaning
heavily
towards
niedermayer
for
that
reason
kariya
could
go
or
unless
a

can
convince
him
to

sad
i

the

in

i

they
even
missed

they
were

two
guys
holding
each

concept

one
of
the
main
problems
with
hockey
is
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
show
everything
that
is
going

more
happens
away
from
the
puck
than
in
any
other
sport
except
maybe
football

they
can
do
isos

the
problem

is
that

what

is

fire
under

dont

im
new

this
system
and
a
big
hockey
fan
and
a
long
ranger
fan
but
remember
suffering
builds
character
i
have
some
final
questions
about
the
way
the
team
was
handled
in
that
last
dreadful
stretch
knowing
they
needed
offensive
help
from
the
blueline
why
didnt
we
see
mike
hurlbut
who
played
pretty
well
when
he
was
called
up
when
leetch
first
went
down
why
is
joe
kocur
playing
every
night
he
is
not
bob
probert
who
is
tough
but
also
can
play
how
come
paul
broten
is
relegated
to
street
clothes
for
the
end
of
the
season
at
least
he
plays
with
some
heart
and
character
draws
penalties
and
plays
when
hes
on
the
ice
was
he
in
the
doghouse
for
some
reason
joe
cirella
enough
said
ranger
fans
may
be
suffering
but
were
some
of
the
most
loyal
unlike
islander
fans
who
only
show
up
when
the
team
wins
as
far
as
the
stanley
cup
goes
i
think
theres
only
one
team
that
can
test
pittsburgh
and
thats
detroit
this
would
be
the
most
entertaining
and
hard
fought
series
mario
is
amazing
kurt
i
think
joe
kocus
should
play
every
night
he
is
a
big
physical
guy
and
he
gets
the
fans
into
the
game
with
some
big
hits
both
checks
and
fists
its
a
big
advantage
to
get
the
crowd
going
plus
he
helps
protect
the
other
players
notice
there
are
very
few
fights
when
kocur
is
on
the
ice
unless
he
is
it
i
have
seen
people
start
to
go
after
essa
tikkanen
only
to
go
slinking
away
when
kocur
steps
in
i
think
he
is
big
asset
but
should
be
third
line
and
special
situation
only
play
this
is
fast
becoming
a
game
without
the
goons
i
admit
kocur
may
get
the
fans
into
the
game
but
surely
they
would
rather
see
broten
taking
a
pass
from
kovalev
and
scoring
a
breakaway
goal
to
put
the
rangers
up
magic
goals
in
the
third
period
rather
than
seeing
kocur
take
another
stupid
penalty
and
the
rangers
giving
up
another
powerplay
goal
the
rangers
need
another
top
flight
center
who
can
take
the
pressure
off
messier
and
the
first
line
nemchinov
is
a
perfect
third
line
center

who
goes

richter

the

overcame
the
red

in
what
was
possibly
the
most
exciting
game
played
yet
in
this
playoff
year
potvin
was
solid
and
wendel
completely
dominated
probert
gilmour
as
usual
was
the
best
player
on
the
ice
and
to
those
who
claim
that
andreychuk
fades
in

please
take
note
andreychuk
is

can
you
or
any

comment
on

the
first

i
heard
this
piece
of
news
was
on
the
post

radio
interview
here
in

that
was
the
bronze
medal
game
in

tichonovs

porin
assat
the
aces
of
town
pori
lost
vasili
the
son
of
victor
tichonov
the
famous
soviet
coach
said
that
for
a
long
time
the
sharks
have
been
persuading
him
to
take
the
assistant
coach
post
but
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
where
ever
he
goes
he
definitely
wont
be
coaching
assat
anymore
after
three
seasons
i
dont
know
why
vasili
is
a
good
coach
i
believe
assat
was
a
good
team
produced
many
players
to
our
national
team
assat
wasnt
a
skilled
team
imho
but
they
had
the
fighting
spirit
after
all
they
butchered
jokerit
in
the
playoffs
and
gave
hard
time
to
tps
the
champs
but
assat
wasnt
consistent
only
when
they
were
in
the
right
mood
they
could
beat
any
team
in
the
smliiga
i
am
not
sure
about
the
deal
with
the
sharks
as
i
said
he
wants
to
be
the
head
coach
but
he
and
the
sharks
are
going
to
negotiate
and
decide
during
the
wc
i
doubt
that
he
will
be
the
head
coach
but
maybe
theyll
do
some
compromise
could
somebody
post
more
information
about
vasili
i
know
he
was

the
former
soviet

robert

many
people
have
suggested
that
fuhrs
play
is
the
only
reason
that
the
sabres
beat
the
bruins
while
fuhr
was
a
critical
factor
i
would
not
overlook
the
fact
that
the
sabres
finally
got
some
scoring
from
people
other
than
mogilny
and
lafontaine
khmylev
sweeney
hawerchuck
etc
indeed
lafontaine
played
hurt
and
didnt
score
many
goals
also
the
team
played
better
defense
although
not
great
than
in
the
regular
season
fuhr
deserves
a
lot
of
credit
but
not
all
of
it
robert
a
i
agree
with
this
i
also
think
fuhrs
contribution
for
sabress
win
is
just
the
same
as
many
palyers
in
the
team
mogilny
had
six
goals
in
four
games
including
two
goals
for
the
great
comeback
in
the
final
win
after
fuhr
had
left
the
key
for
sabress
win
over
boston
is
whole
teams
strong
commitment
as
an
underdog
and
all
their
talent
players
including
mogilny
and
fuhr
i
think
that
grant
fuhr
deserves
more
credit
than
that
while
its
true
that
the
entire
sabres
team
played
very
well
i
still
believe
that
if
it
wasnt
for
grant
fuhr
the
series
would
now
be
tied
he
virtually
stole
games
and
for
the
sabres
in
both
of
these
games
fuhr
stood
on
his
head
to
give
the
sabres
the
chance
to
win
especially
in
game
fuhr
made
a
series
of
huge
stops
in
the
third
period
when
the
score
was
tied
even
in
game
when
the
sabres
won
the
score
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
sabres
dominated
however
if
it
hadnt
been
for
fuhr
the
sabres
wouldnt
have
been
up
i
think
it
was
through
the
period
and
the
bruins
wouldnt
have
had
to
open
up
the
game
thereby
allowing
mogilny
to
score
the
third
goal
on
a
breakaway
to
salt
away
the
game
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
fuhr
was
the
critical
factor
in
the
victory
in
my
opinion
neely
oates
and
juneau
played
as
well
as
lafontaine
mogilny
and
hawerchuk
the
sabres
did
get
extraordinary
efforts
from
hannan
sweeney
wood
and
khmylev
compared
to
that
of
the
bruins
checkers
however
the
bruins
defense
imo
played
better
than
the
sabres
defense
the
sabres
have
ken
sutton
playing
a
regular
shift
afterall
the
difference
in
the

so
why
is

is
it
that
the

is

profiteer

town
and
move
it

none
of
us
will
ever
know
the
real
inside
story
but
from
what
i
know
a
group
of
minneapolis
businessmen
told
green
repeatedly
that
they
would
purchase
the
remaining
season
tickets
to
get
to
the
level
that
green
wanted
yet
he
refused
every
time
its
pretty
obvious
that
he
was
determined
to
get
out
of
minneapolis
at
any
cost
and
use
the
season
tickets
thing
as
an
excuse
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
to
the
penultimate
game
and
the
fans
were
great
people
were
tailgating
and
playing
roller
hockey
in
the
parking
lot
before
the
game
the
attendance
was
so
full
as
to
have
sro
and
the
whole
atmosphere
in

was
terrific
minnesota

re
minnesota
shame
ive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
norman
green
claims
that
he
has
lost
money
over
the
last
three
years
that
he
has
owned
the
team
when
he
bought
the
team
it
seemed
kind
of
obvious
that
he
was
going
to
have
to
deal
with
a
few
years
in
the
red
before
the
team
started
making
a
profit
again
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
willing
to
do
so
he
claimed
two
years
ago
that
the
team
needed
to
average
only
fans
per
game
in
order
to
pull
a
profit
but
this
season
the
team
averaged
fans
despite
increasd
ticket
prices
i
think
the
teams
attendence
and
play
was
clearly
in
an
upward
trend
which
leaves
me
dumbfounded
as
to
how
he
could
ignore
that
in
deciding
to
move
he
was
even
offered
the
many
concessions
he
rudely
demanded
such
as
guaranteed
season
ticket
sales
cheap
rent
at
the
other
two
arenas
in
town
etc
oh
well
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
green
wanted
immediate
huge
returns
in
dallas
and
wasnt
willing
to
wait
another
year
or
so
in
mn
dallas
gave
green
a
pretty
stellar
deal
to
play
there
although
i
feel
minnesotas
was
quite
reasonable
and
he
also
has
some
cronies
down
there
as
well
all
this
means
is
that
minnesota
is
without
an
nhl
team
for
a
year

two

im

more

now
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a

blind

canucks
fan
but
unlike
those
from

i
do
not

to
vent
my
spleen
upon
the
world
as
to
how
great
my
team
is
i
know
i
have
confidence
in
them
and
thats
enough
granted
the
jets
finished
the
season
hot
and
the
canucks
were
having
trouble
but
vancouver
has
built
themselves
a
reputation
for
being
a
playoff
team
just
ask
any
flames
fan
they
may
not
win
every
series
but
they
alway
fight
to
the
end
ill
admit
that
last
year
was
not
great
but
if
they
combine
the
work
ethic
of
the
past
with
the
new
tallent
of
the
present
they
will
be
tough
to
beat
note
i
did
not
say
they
would
pummel
every
team
they
meet
and
destroy
the
greatest
player
playing
today
now
like
any
canucks
fan
i
would
love
to
see
them
take
the

i
feel
they
have
a
good

to
make
it
out

i

my
point
isnt
that
the

were
biased
just
that
they
were
calling
a
lot
of
penalties
which
works
to
the
benefit
of
the

having
the
ref
call
a
whole
bunch
of
penalties
against
one
team
then
calling
a

a

worst
game
ive

federovs
major
was
obvious
and
i
dont
dispute
it
however
chaissons
penalty
shouldnt
even
have
been
a
penalty
let
alone
a
major
and
a
game
misconduct
the
game
misc
call
is
for
high
sticking
only
there
is
no
blood
penalty
just
because
chaisson
barely
touched
the
poor
sap
and
he
hit
the
dasher
and
bled
profusely
doesnt
mean
it
is
a
penalty
unfortunately
the
instant
replay
is
not
used
on
hits
at
first
i
immediately
thought
and
a
game
because
the
hit
looked
much
more
severe
from
an
intenttoinjure
perspective
than
it
was
after
seeing
the
replay
id
say
it
deserved
minutes
for
boarding
it
was
careless
any
way
you
slice
it
if
stewart
had
replay
i
do
not
think
chaisson
would
have
gotten
and
the
game
in
the
second
period
behind
potvin
probert
had
the
puck
and
was
going
to
get
out
front
and
was
tackled
i
couldnt
believe
the
nocall
this
nocall
was
bullshit
i
agree
i
admire
stewart
for
letting
them
go
but
probert
looked
up
saying
where
the
hell
is
the
penalty
ive
never
seen
probert
whine
either
he
doesnt
need
to
now
if
probie
decides
to
put
wendel
through
the
boards
hes
probably
gone
right
i
dont
remember
who
on
the
leafs
touched
the
puck
on
racines
shot
towards
the
end
of
the
game
seconds
left

stewart
called
it
out
of
play
last
touched
by
detroit
everybody
in
the
garden
including
the
linesmen
knew
it
yzerman
protested
but
stewart
just
laughed
and
really
homered
the

this
was
also
bullshit
but
once

no

it
was
rouse
btw
im
really
pissed
that
the

didnt

refuse

yes
the
calls
you

should

the

have
no

for

they
should
be

the

pissed
me
off
the
most
was
anderson

team
after
this
season
or
next
milwaukee
was
mentioned
as
the

potential
destination
the
person
who
told
me
this
is
strongly
affiliated
with
the
nhl
and
has
been
extremely
accurate
in
the
past
with
news
of
this
sort
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
so
or
has
heard
anything
of
the
sort
with
baltimores
ahl
team
gone
that
would
leave
the
area
with
only
an
echl
franchise
in
baltimore
not
good
thanks
david
why
dcbaltimore
is
one
of
the
top
media
markets
the
only
thing
the
nhl
seems
to
care
about
these
days
theyve
been
doing
far
better
than
the
nba
bullets
at
the
gate
for
the
last
five
years
the
team
has
been
a
perennial
contender
and
fan
support
has
been
good
to
excellent
why
should
pollin
move
to
city
thats
five
times
smaller
but
has
as
many
teams
in
other
pro
sports
i
dont

finlandnorway
in
wc
finns
had
to
do
their
best
last
night
when
they
played
against
norway
in
world
champs
after
two
periods
the
score
was
still
this
game
was
quite
much
similar
to
the
first
game
finland
played
against
france
the
norwegian
goalie
was
very
good
and
a
bit
lucky
too
in
the
third
period
juha
riihijrvi
scored
from
a
rebound
the
time
was
around
mins
or
so
the
second
goal
was
scored
by
kari
harila
who
shot
straight
from
a
faceoff
behind
the
nowwegian
goalie
saku
koivu
the
center
got
his
first
point
of
this
tournament
saku
koivu
played
very
well
througout
the
game
and
he
was
awarded
the
best
player
of
the
game
prize
despite
the
fact
that
he
is
quite
small
in
size
he
handles
the
puck
very
well
and
is
a
fast
skater
i
think
that
we
will
hear
from
this
guy
in
the
future
subject
re
nhl
letter
quite
long
in
catchernetcomcom
paul
w
francisco
writes
as
she
said
the
letter
is
addressed
to
bettman
the
post
which
though
having
pretty
much
the
same
content
is
an
entirely
different
entity
was
addressed
to
all
when
she
puts
the
letter
in
the
mail
i
doubt
it
will
say
to
all
i
figure
she
wanted
to
let
people
here
see
what
was
in
it
since
it
is
a
topic
that
interests
a
lot
of
folks
here
thats
an
entirely
different
purpose
than
sending
the
letter
to
bettman
and
it
is
a
damn
good
thing
that
she
did
post
it
since
she
claims
to
represent
people
in
recsporthockey
unfortunately
the
largest
computer
networks
in
the
world
phrase
is
a
definition
of
the
internet
not
a
group
as
a
whole
that
she
claims
to
represent
as
her
sole
purpose
in
mentioning
the
net
as
steve
gallichio
has
already
pointed
out
is
to
lend
weight
to
her
points
through
association
with
the
internet
there
is
no
other
reason
to
mention
the
internet
this
is
misrepresentation
and
if
the
internet
was
a
private
corporation
alison
would
be
leaving
herself
wide
open
to
all
kinds
of
civil
suits
for
the
business
of
whether
or
not
it
is
large
it
is
large
compared
to
say
the
number
of
folks
on
rsh
who
are
sending
a
letter
to
thank
him
for
changing
the
names
at
least
to
this
point
and
just
for
my
this
is
not
a
letter
it
is
a
petition
claiming
to
represent
a
large
proportion
of
recsporthockey
users
and
by
implication
a
significant
number
of
internet
users
names
can
in
no
way
be
considered
a
large
proportion
of
recsporthockey
which
while
we
have
no
way
of
counting
actual
readership
is
accessible
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
persons
is
no
more
than
a
flys
fart
in
a
windstorm
own
curiosity
i
thought
id
look
up
the
official
definition
of
large
in
the
dictionary
it
reads
large
having
more
than
usual
power
capacity
or
scope
exceeding
most
other
things
of
like
kind
in
quantity
or
size
gee
you
looked
up
large
in
the
dictionary
what
next
two
syllable
words
now
i
have
no
idea
how
many
letters
bettman
may
have
gotten
on
the
issue
or
how
many
people
may
have
signed
them
people
may
be
up
there
thereby
validating
definition
i
would
also
wager
that
the
geographical
range
of
signatures
is
quite
large
which
would
give
it
a
large
scope
let
me
suggest
that
the
only
place
you
are
likely
to
envy
the
magnitude
of
is
when
you
are
looking
for
ways
to
beef
up
your
iq
scores
he
might
be
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
list
of
names
why
would
he
be
impressed
with
this
unless
it
were
large
as
i
said
he
might
be
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
list
of
names
but
it
would
have
to
be
considerably
larger
but
even
this
definition
does
not
account
for
the
original
context
from
which
you
lifted
this
sentence
i
personally
dont
know
whether
or
not
i
agree
with
the
letter
i
have
very
mixed
emotions
about
it
i
like
the
names
as
they
are
and
dont
think
they
make
it
that
difficult
to
learn
the
game
but
there
might
be
a
shred
of
validity
to
the
change
well
then
what
the
hell
is
your
point
you
dont
really
know
if
you
have
an
opinion
about
the
hockey
issue
but
you
do
know
that
you
dont
like
me
is
that
it
cordially

susan

writes
amongst

fans
there
seems
to
be
an
inner
calm
that
ive
never
experienced
before
this
year
with
the
pens
the
players
and
the
fans
have
so
much
confidence
in
the
team
this
year
were
savoring
every
game
and
saving
our
energy
for
the
stanley
cup
thats
a
good
way
to
put
it
its
a
quiet
confidence
i
dont
feel
like
i
have
to
defend
this
team
anymore
the
devils
are
a
puzzle
to
me
they
have
long
been
one
of
the
few
teams
i
always
dreaded
playing
their
d
isnt
quite
what
it
used
to
be
but
they
still
usually
play
us
pretty
tough
i
just
cant
figure
it
out
at
least
last
night
they
mounted
an
attack
watching
some
of
the
devils
players
being
interviewed
i
could
see
in
their
faces
and
eyes
that
they
really
dont
have
any
confidence
they
are
left
speechless
when
asked
what
more
they
can
to
do
to
beat
the
pens
they
act
as
though
they
know
its
a
hopeless
task
bernie
nichols
was
interviewed
after
game
on
the
late
news
he
was
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
over
barrasso
saying
that
tommy
is
like
another
defenseman
out
there
and
how
difficult
it
is
playing
against
him
then
he
got
this
faraway
look
on
his
face
his
voice
started
trailing
off
and
he
said
it
just
isnt
rightit
just
isnt
fair
and
he
tried
to
muster
a
smile
im
really
impressed
with
bowmans
coaching
tactics
hes
had
an
answer
for
every
move
that
brooks
has
thrown
at
the
pens
as
far
as
coaching
goes
a
pensislanders
matchup
should
be
pretty
good
one
guy
i
feel
sorry
for
in
all
of
this
so
far
is
chris
terreri
im
sure
tom
barrasso
knows
how
he
feels
for
so
long
tommy
would
look
up
and
not
have
a
teammate
in
sight
terreris
teammates
really
left
him
out
in
the
cold
in
the
first
two
games
mom
from
news
for
the
first
time
all
season
the
flames
are
now
injuryfree
the
only
player
remaining
on
the
limp
is
center
carey
wilson
who
even
when
healthy
is
not
a
major
part
of
the
team
trent
yawney
did
not
score
a
goal
all
season
until
the
last
regular
season
game
against
san
jose
he
potted
his
first
of
the
year
in
that
game
and
has
also
scored
goals
in
both
game
and
game
against
los
angeles
thoughts
on
game
the
flames
played
horribly
in
dropping
the
first
game
of
their
series
with
los
angeles
on
sunday
afternoon
they
seemed
more
interested
in
throwing
big
hits
than
in
scoring
goals
they
physically
dominated
the
kings
but
that
was
the
only
area
they
dominated
in
the
game
plan
was
to
rush
the
net
and
try
and
take
advantage
of
a
young
inexperienced
la
defence
and
the
shaky
kings
goaltending
but
those
plans
fell
by
the
wayside
while
the
flames
conducted
a
steady
march
to
the
penalty
box
particularily
stupid
was
theoren
fleury
taking
a
five
minute
major
and
a
game
misconduct
for
slamming
warren
rychels
face
into
the
dasher
while
rychel
was
on
his
knees
goaltender
mike
vernon
played
well
and
could
not
really
be
faulted
for
the
loss
despite
his
wellpublicized
poor
record
in
afternoon
games
he
got
very
little
support
from
his
defence
in
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
and
sweeping
away
rebounds
in
fact
marty
mcsorleys
goal
actually
went
in
off
chris
dahlquists
skate
in
front
of
the
net
thoughts
on
game
the
flames
came
back
strong
in
the
second
game
evidently
aware
of
the
potentially
fatal
consequences
of
losing
both
the
first
two
games
on
home
ice
the
first
period
was
fairly
even
with
the
edge
going
to
the
kings
but
calgary
came
out
strong
in
the
second
period
and
simply
dominated
the
kings
scoring
five
goals
to
take
a
lead
they
never
relinquished
en
route
to
a
win
the
deciding
factors
in
this
game
were
faceoffs
and
special
teams
calgary
dominated
on
faceoffs
as
they
did
in
game
but
they
were
able
to
make
better
use
of
the
won
faceoffs
in
this
game
than
they
did
in
the
first
one
calgary
also
went
on
the
powerplay
while
la
only
went
and
gave
up
a
shorthanded
goal
to
joel
otto
las
powerplay
goal
also
came
late
in
the
game
with
the
outcome
already
decided
the
kings
powerplay
failed
them
when
they
needed
it
most
in
the
and
periods
the
flames
lost
rw
greg
paslawski
with
a
suspected
shoulder
injury
when
he
was
leveled
by
alexei
zhitnik
right
after
scoring
calgarys
goal
charlie
huddy
left
the
game
for
the
kings
with
a
groin
injury
the
game
was
marred
by
stupidity
in
the
last
minute
first
craig
berube
of
calgary
took
a
fiveminute
major
for
fighting
plus
a
game
misconduct
for
instigating
when
he
went
after
tony
granato
for
no
apparent
reason
granato
drew
a
minor
for
some
strange
reason
turtling
perhaps
this
was
followed
seconds
later
by
warren
rychel
drawing
a
major
minor
and
game
misconduct
for
hitting
frank
musil
in
the
face
with
his
stick
and
then
instigating
a
fight
musil
got
a
fighting
major
for
some
similarily
strange
reason
hardy
and
yawney
went
toetotoe
and
both
got
double
minors
gregson
thought
that
musil
turtling
amounted
to
fighting
but
that
yawney
and
hardy
throwing
punches
at
each
other
was

so
whats
stopping
pocklington
from
going
to
a
bank
and
borrowing
million
dollars
to
pay
off
his
treasury
branch
loansi
was
reading
according
to
the
recent
tsn
report
peter
puck
is
not
paying
any
interest
on
the
treasury
branch
loans
thats
a
lot
of
green
somewhere
than
pocklington
business
have
gross
revenues
of
about
million
per
yeari
dont
think
he
would
have
much
problem
borrowing
from
his
visa
to
pay
off
his
mastercard
if
he
wanted
to
again
according
to
tsn
virtually
everything
that
peter
puck
has
already
has
liens
against
it
of
course
we
cant
really
be
sure
of
this
pocklington
is
at
the
point
of
maximum
advantage
right
nowand
he
is
basically
right
in
that
northlands
which
is
a
creature
of
the
city
of
edmonton
must
give
him
a
better
deal
in
the
era
of
escalating
salaries
northlands
and
the
city
benefitted
as
much
as
he
did
during
the
eighties
from
the
oilersand
wealth
generated
by
the
oilers
success
was
sharedbut
the
finanical
viability
of
small
market
teams
has
radically
changed
in
the
space
of
a
couple
of
years
and
for
the
oilers
to
remain
viable
and
competitive
they
need
much
more
of
the
revenue
stream
from
concessions
parking
and
building
advertising
as
most
every
other
professional
sports
franchise
in
north
america
has
what
was
once
a
fair
agreement
that
shared
the
wealth
is
now
northlands
sucking
the
blood
out
of
the
oilers
franchise
the
oiler
rationale
regarding
the
renegotiation
of
player
contracts
is
that
a
deal
is
a
deal
sather
has
spouted
this
repeatedly
pocklinton
has
a
contract
with
northlands
until
a
deal
is
a
deal
perhaps
if
he
included
the
income
he
has
received
from
his
sale
of
assets
players
such
as
gretzky
and
the
income
he
has
received
in
expansion
fees
with
his
revenues
he
wouldnt
be
losing
money
he
has
admitted
pulling
this
money
out
of
the
oiler
franchise
to
put
into
his
other
businesses
the
oilers
have
paid
several
times
over
what
the
coliseum
cost
to
build
and
bring
edmonton
prestige
and
recognition
throughout
the
world
that
is
essentially
pricelessto
nickelanddime
the
oilers
just
so
northlands
can
use
revenue
sucked
out
of
the
oilers
to
subsidize
their
horseracing
operations
is
insanity
i
think
that
pocklington
has
received
ample
provincial
subsidization
i
cant
really
blame
him
for
going
after
municipal
subsidization
but
he
is
certainly
not
entitled
to
it
pocklington
has
sucked
revenue
out
of
the
oilers
in
order
to
prop
up
his
failing
business
interests
pocklington
is
not
to
be
trusted
i
doubt
very
much
that
any
oiler
team
will
ever
again
make
the
playoffs
under
pocklingtons
stewardship
as
soon
as
a
player
shows
himself
to
be
a
competent
nhler
and
expects
to
be
paid
accordingly
he
is
shipped
off
for
younger
players
and
or
draft
picks
cordially
as

maynardramseycslaurentianca

many

so
little

most

again
beat

best

six
times
en

to

easy
victory
over

team
in

felix

six
was

quebecs
powerplay

lethal

it

have
a

where

can
clean
up
with
their
superior
powerplay
montreal
really
lost
that

game
because
patrick
roy
is
well
on

to
having
another
one

awful

quebec

what
is
the
policy
regarding
players
and
the
minor
league
playoffs
versus
wc
i
know
that
the
rangers
are
holding
back
kovalev
zubov
and
andersson
for
binghamton
but
i
also
know
that
the
whalers
wanted
michael
nylander
to
play
for
springfield
while
nylander
wanted
to
play
for
sweden
the
whalers
allowed
the
nhl
to
decide
and
the
nhl
chose
the
wcs
how
does
this
differ
from
the
rangers
and
oilers
did
the
whalers
have
to
go
through
the
league
or
could
they
have
forced
nylander
to
play
in
springfield
as
long
as
a
player
is
under
contract
to
an
organization
he
is
obligated
to
play
only
where
that
organization
tells
him
to
play
or
gives
him
permission
to
play
the
rangers
are
certainly
within
their
rights
to
force
zubov
and
andersson
to
report
to
binghampton
it
certainly
does
reflect
a
lack
of
class
on
the
part
of
the
ranger
organization
however
is
having
binghampton
win
the
calder
cup
really
more
important
to
them
than
keeping
their
players
happy

for

missed
that
slash

would

better

so
your
above
arguement
is
really
worthless
personally
i
always
thought
that
most
valuable

was
silly
why
should
the
best

in

league
be
penalized
because
he
plays
on
a
team
with
other
good
players
why
should
a
lesser
player
be
picked
solely
because
hes
the
best
player
on
a
weak
team
wouldnt
the
weaker
team
be
helped
even
more
by
the
best
player
in
the
league
doesnt
the
presence
of
the
best
player
in
the
league
make
the
other
players
on
the
team
look
better
too
the
hart
trophy
was
orginally
awarded
in
a
time
where
people
did
not
think
in
terms
of
who
was
the
best
player
rather
in
terms
of
who
was
the
most
valuable
to
the
team
and
valuable
to
his
team
was
not
and
should
not
be
considered
synonymous
with
best
we
are
talking
about
a
time
when
honour
and
attitude
not
measurable
skills
were
the
most
important
assets
a
player
brought
to
his
team
his
league
and

this

otherwise
there

on

the
blues
caught
a
few
breaks
without

one
was
the
referee
constantly
watching
the
blackhawks
looking
for
reasons
to
give
them
penalties
second
the
blues
first
goal
resulted
because
the
puck

you

cheveldae
looks

he
probably
i

i
dont

many

that
could

chevy
has
done
that
the
past
two
seasons
playing
behind
a
defense
that
is
not
exactly
the
best
in
the
league
his
wins
this
year
were
not
all
against
toronto
and
for
those
who
look
at
vincent
rien
stats
and
think
he
should
be
starting
take
a
look
at
the
teams
he
played
against
teams
like
san
jose
ottawa
and
tb
any
nhl
goalie
could
post
a
decent
record
playing
teams
like
that
night
in

night
out
is
look
for
detroit
management
to
remedy
the
situation
in
the
offseason
i
really
dont
see
this
happening
if
they
didnt
think
cheveldae
could
do
the
job
they
would
of
traded
for
somebody
this
year
after
all
why
wait
until
next
year
when
there
were
goalies
available
this
year
hey
i
may
be
wrong
but
after
watching
him
kick
rebound
after
rebound
into
the
high
slot
i
dont
think
he
can
carry
them
in
the
tough
games
ie
those
not
against
toronto
better
to
kick
out
rebounds
than
to
let
goals
in
if
st
louis
gets
past
chicago
watch
for
joseph
to
carry
the
blues
past
an
otherwise
vastly
superior
red
wings
club
joseph
is
hot
but
so
are
the
wings
they
have
scored
six
goals
in
both
of
their
games
so
far
with
toronto
supposively
one
of
the

best
defenses

the
most
logical
trade
in

to
me
would
be
between
detroit

im
sure
if
beezer
would

he
would
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
his

in

he
would
be
a
valuable
asset
to
the

perhaps
the

could
get
a
zombo
in

beezer
got
a

you
should
at

make

that
prime

got
a
commitment
that
the

would
be
scrapped
and
that
the

would
go

within

as
for

they

when

ill
refuse

since
i

the

could

the

chris
basically
raised
the
possibility
that

biased
in

of

he
noted
that
the
offices
for
the

are
in
spring
and
many
exindians
are
working
for
the
ahl
furthermore
he
also
informed
me
that
back
a
few
years
ago
in
the
cup
finals
between
roch
and
spring
that
the
amerks
charged
favoritism
by
the
office
and
that
there
were
little
questionable
things
liket
he
ahl
president
and
staff
attending
all
games
with
the

brass
including
sitting
in
their
box
for
the
game
in
springfield
and
according
to
the
rochester
media
openly
cheering
for
springfield
certainly
this
is
something
that
is
quite
serious
if
any
of
this
is
true
i
dont
know
if
this
is
anything
more
than
whining
on
the
part
of
the
amerks
they
have
pulled
this
sort
of
crap
against

subject
re
wings
news
and
playoff
thoughts
as
far
as
cheveldae
is
concerned
he
is
a
decent
goalie
the
most
logical
trade
in
the
offseason
to
me
would
be
between
detroit
and
ny
rangers
im
sure
if
beezer
would
be
traded
he
would
enjoy
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
his
roots
in
detroit
he
would
be
a
valuable
asset
to
the
wings
and
perhaps
the
rangers
could
get
a
zombo
in
return
beezer
got
a
few
good
years
in
him
and
the
opportunity
to
get
a
fresh
start
would
energize
his
play
only
problem
is
that
zombo
was
traded
to
st
louis
last
year
for
goalie
vincent
riendeau
i
think
that
while
chevy
is
not
among
the
elite
class
of
goalies
he
is
adequate
given
the
offensive
firepower
of
the
wings

hi
all
due
to
living
in
the
bay
area
i
as
unable
to
see
vancouvers
victory
over
the
jets
last
night
i
know
the
score
but
that
rarely
describes
the
game
could
someone
please
post
a
brief
sonapsis
sp
of
waht
happened
how
well
did
each
team
play
were
the
cannucks
deserving
of
the
victory
well
in
my
opinion
the
canucks
played
a
really
strong
game
i
was
especially
pleased
by
a
very
strong
game
from
linden
i
think
he
could
be
a
key
to
success
for
them
this
year
defensively
they
really
had
a
strong
game
hardly
heard
selannes
name
all
night
craven
also
played
one
of
his
best
games
since
coming
over
with
a
few
exceptions
they
really
didnt
let
the
highflying
jets
do
much
highflying
i
thought
the
jets
defence
looked
overmatched
by
the
canucks
forwards
they
will
have
to
improve
on
that
if
they
want
to
make
this
a
series
in
short
it
was
a
great
start

canucks
over
winnipeg
the
jets
gave
the
canucks
another
run
for
their
money
in
an
almost
identical
game
to
the
first
of
the
series
but
once
again
came
up
short
as
vancouver
outscored
winnipeg
the
pattern
of
the
first
game
was
repeated
tonight
with
the
canucks
scoring
quickly
and
then
going
to
sleep
in
the
second
period
only
to
stave
off
a
jet
comeback
with
opportune
goals
from
their
greater
talent
the
jets
looked
more
dangerous
in
this
one
but
it
didnt
make
a
difference
in
the
numbers
that
counted
goals
vancouvers
big
line
produced
again
with
centre
cliff
ronning
and
left
winger
geoff
courtnall
scoring
in
the
first
and
in
the
second
to
boost
the
canucks
to
a
lead
on
giveaways
by
the
suspect
jet
defence
of
bautin
and
ulanov
mental
lapses
by
the
defence
and
goalscoring
talent
in
opportune
areas
made
the
difference
in
all
three
canuck
goals
however
as
in
the
first
game
the
jets
worked
hard
to
take
the
game
to
the
canucks
in
the
second
period
the
jets
dominated
the
second
checking
hard
and
penetrating
the
vancouver
zone
without
being
challenged
by
a
canuck
team
that
wanted
to
pack
it
in
early
the
hard
work
paid
off
late
in
the
second
when
tie
domi
caught
vancouver
goalie
kirk
mclean
by
surprise
with
a
sharp
angle
shot
to
make
the
score
domis
goal
gave
the
jets
new
life
as
they
began
to
take
the
rush
to
the
canucks
collapsing
defence
the
canucks
were
unwilling
to
do
anything
but
let
mclean
take
shots
and
clear
the
rebounds
the
jets
were
allowed
to
set
up
and
make
plays
both
goalies
made
standup
saves
as
the
play
picked
up
considerably
mclean
made
three
great
saves
in
the
second
off
a
dancing
teammu
selanne
while
essensa
was
rocked
by
a
pavel
bure
drive
selanne
looked
dangerous
on
the
rush
as
the
jets
pressed
a
series
of
attacks
into
the
canuck
zone
the
canucks
on
the
other
hand
looked
like
they
were
offering
four
checking
lines
in
an
effort
to
preserve
their
slim
lead
a
series
of
minor
penalties
at
the
end
of
the
second
period
resulted
in
a
one
man
advantage
for
the
jets
in
the
early
third
the

tempo
numminen
drove
a
puck
from
the
point
through
mcleans
legs
and
into
the
net
to
tie
the
game
at
the
canucks
discordant
play
picked
up
where
it
left
off
this
was
characterized
by
long
lead
passes
that
either
never
connected
or
were
picked
off
by
the
jets
and
individual
rushes
into
a
tight
winnipeg
defence
that
were
never
supported
however
as
in
the
first
and
second
canuck
goals
a
jet
defensive
lapse
re
bonehead
play
stalled
the
winnipeg
comeback
with
the
faceoff
in
the
winnipeg
zone
pavel

was
left
to
stand
in

invisible
in

up

managed

roof
it
with

backhand
even
though

late

i

your

why
moan

youre

take
exception
but

never

i
personally
disagree

were
