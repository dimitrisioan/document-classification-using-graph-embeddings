did
not

the

was

what
was

that

can
draw

from

the

has
already

during

the
annual
rate
of
robbery
in

was
found
to
be
only
slightly
higher

that
in
vancouver
burglaries
occurred
at
nearly

the
risk
of
being
a

of
a
simple
assault
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
only
slightly
higher
than
vancouver
and
the
risk
of
aggravated
assault
was
also
slightly
higher
however
when
aggravated
assaults
were
subdivided
by
weapon
and
the
mechanism
of
assault
a
clear
pattern
emerged
although
both
cities
reported
nearly
identical
rates
of
aggravated
assault
involving
knives
and
other
dangerous
weapons
firearms
were
far
more
likely
to
be
used
in

the
relative

homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
when
homicides
were
subdivided
by
the
mechanism
of
death
the
rate
of
homicide
by
knives
and
other
weapons
excluding
firearms
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
almost
identical
to
that
in
vancouver
virtually
all
of
the
increased
risk
of
death
in
seattle
was
due
to
a
more
than
fivefold
higher
rate
of
homicide
by
firearms
handguns
accounted
for
roughly
of
homicides
involving
firearms
handguns
were
times
more
likely
to
be
used
in
homicides
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
authors
of
the

also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by

only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
in
seattle
and
in
vancouver
only
involved
firearms
after
excluding
these
cases
there
was
virtually
no
impact
on
these
earlier
findings
this
is
i
feel
a
very
fair
report
one
might
even
make
the
argument
that
it
is
biased
against
canada
as
a
whole
because
vancouver
reports
annual
rates
of
homicide
two
to
three
times
that
of
ottawa
calgary
and
toronto
while
seattle
reports
annual
homicide
rates
only
half
to
twothirds
that
of
nyc
chicago
los
angeles
and
houston
critics
of
handgun
control
always
argue
that
limited
legal
access
to
handguns
will
have
little
effect
on
the
rates
of
homicide
because
persons
intent
on
killing
others
will
only
try
harder
to
acquire
a
gun
or
will
kill
by
other
means
this
report
shows
differently
if
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
were
influenced
more
by
the
strength
of
intent
than
by
the
availability
of
weapons
we
could
expect
the
rate
of
homicides
by
weapons
other
than
guns
to
be
higher
in
vancouver
than
in
seattle
however
during
the
study
interval
vancouvers
rate
of
homicide
by
weapons
other
than
guns
was
not
significantly
higher
than
that
in
seattle
suggesting
that
few
wouldbe
assailants
switched
to
homicide
by
other
methods
as
well
ready
access
to
handguns
for
selfdefense
by
lawabiding
citizens
was
not
endorsed
in
this
report
although
seattle
did
experience
a
higher
rate
of
firearm
death
for
selfdefense
these
cases
accounted
for
less
than
of
the
homicides
in
both
cities
during
the
course
of
the
study
period
and
as
was
reported
seattle
apparently
didnt
enjoy
relief
from
any
crime
category
over
vancouver

understates
the

second
however

nothing
about
the
number
of

nonprotective

cook
index
is
based
on
the
average
of
the
percentage
of
firearms
involvement
in
suicide
and
homicide
so
the
authors
are
basically
taking
a
measure
of
misuse
unsurprisingly
gun
misuse
in
homicide
in
seattle
in
vancouver
is
related
to
gun
misuse
in
homicide
plus
suicide
divided
by
two
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
authors
are
not
measuring
the
relative
avail
ability
of
firearms
or
of
handguns
in
seattle
and
vancouver
the
authors
misstate
the
laws
of
both
washington
and
canada
they
neglect
to
mention
the
significant
fact
that
washington
has
a
waiting
period
and
background
check
prior
to
the
purchase
of
a
handgun
and
that
provisions
exist
in
canadian
law
for
owning
and
carrying
handguns
for
personal
protection
the
authors
also
make
it
appear
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
a
handgun
legally
in
canada
than
is
actually
the
case
the
authors
ignore
all
other
factors
which
might
explain
the
differences
in
crime
rate
beyond
some
vague
mention
of
the
penalities
provided
by
law
and
the
roughest
of
estimates
of
clearence
for
one
particular
offense
homicide
involving
a
firearm
there
is
no
measure
of
the
differences
in
the
number
of
law
enforcement
officers
their
aggressiveness
in
making
arrests
for
gun
law
violations
in
the
two
jurisdictions
arrest
rates
for
other
offenses
conviction
rates
actual
sentences
imposed
for
gunrelated
crimes
violent
crimes
without
guns
or
gun
law
violations
or
incarceration
rates
whereas
social
scientists
would
attempt
to
measure
and
hold
for
such
differences
the
authors
of
the
nejm
tale
of
two
cities
fail
even
to
mention
most
factors
related
to
crime
control
the
authors
dismiss
claims
that
handguns
are
an
effective
means
for
protection
unless
the
criminal
is
killed
such
is
not
the
case
criminologists
ref
have
found
that
almost
americans
annually
use
handguns
for
protection
from
criminals
and
that
using
a
gun
for
protection
reduces
the
liklihood
that
a
crime
rape
robbery
assault
will
be
completed
by
the
criminal
and
reduces
the
likelihood
of
injury
to
the
victim
it
is
interesting
nonetheless
that
the
authors
reported
the
same
number
four
of
civilian
justifiable
homicides
without
firearms
in
each
city
but
that
less
restrictive
seattle
accounted
for
of
the
reported
civilian
justifiable
homicides
involving
firearms
the
centers
for
disease

which
funded
the
study

saying
it

scientific
methods
to
examine

advocates
of

of

handguns
there
is
nothing
in
the
paper
which
could
possibly
be
mistaken
for
scientific
methods
by
a
sociologists
or
criminologists
the
vancouverseattle

is
the
equivolent
of

and
on

announcing

be
nice
to
think
that

a

would
neither
be

the

someone
once

statistics
are
like
a
bikini
what
they
real
is
suggestive
but
what
they
conceal
is
vital
the
problem
is
demonstrated
by
the
most
recent
entry
in
a
long
line
of
scientific
research
purporting
to
show
a
causal
link
between
gun
availability
and
homicide
funded
by
the
federal
government
and
published
last
year
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
study
compared
homicide
rates
in
seattle
and
vancouver
and
suggested
that
a
handgun
ban
may
reduce
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
the
nine
medical
doctors
who
published
handgun
regulations
crime
assaults
and
homicide
essentially
reasoned
in
three
steps
despite
many
historical
social
and
demographic
similarities
vancouver
has
a
markedly
lower
homicide
rate
because
its
stricter
gun
regulations
make
guns
less
available
the
second
step
in
their
reasoning
seems
indisputable
the
overall
homicide
rate
in
seattle
for
the
period
was
per
popuation
compared
with
in
vancouver
homicide
is
definitely
more
common
in
seattle
the
question
then
becomes
why
the
authors
present
a
believable
although
not
entirely
accurate
case
to
support
the
notion
as
claimed
in
the
third
step
of
their
reasoning
that
vancouvers
handgun
regulations
are
much
more
stringent
but
their
evidence
on
the
difference
in
gun
availabilty
is
indirect
and
unpersuasive
indeed
they
acknowledge
that
direct
evidence
on
the
point
does
not
exist
they
offer
two
fragments
of
inferential
data
in
support
of
the
claim
that
guns
are
more
available
in
seattle
but
for
all
anybody
knows
as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact
the
opposite
could
be
true
we
are
therefore
being
asked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
study
to
believe
that
a
difference
in
gun
availability
explains
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
when
a
difference
in
gun
availability
has
not
itself
been
established
indeed
the
situation
is
even
more
troublesome
the
first
of
the
two
indirect
bits
of
evidence
is
a
difference
between
the
number
of
concealed
weapons
permits
issued
in
seattle
and
the
number
of
restrictedweapons
permits
issued
in
vancouver
differences
between
the
two
cities
in
the
permit
regulations
render
these
two
numbers
strictly
noncomparable
the
second
bit
of
evidence
is
cooks
gun
prevalence
index
which
stands
at
percent
for
seattle
but
only
percent
for
vancouver
cooks
index
however
does
not
measure
the
relative
prevalence
of
gun
ownership
in
various
cities
it
measures
gun
misuseit
is
an
average
of
the
percentage
of
homicides
and
suicides
involving
firearms
in
the
present
case
the
index
shows
only
that
in
homicides
and
suicides
firearms
are
more
likely
to
be
used
in
seatte
than
in
vancouver
to
take
cooks
index
as
a
measure
of
general
firearms
availability
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
proportional
involvement
of
guns
in
homicides
and
suicides
is
directly
related
to
their
relative
availability
in
the
general
population
but
this
is
exactly
what
the
authors
are
seeking
to
prove
to
assume
what
one
is
seeking
to
prove
then
to
prove
it
on
the
basis
of
that
assumption
does
ot
constitute
scientific
evidence
for
anything
even
if
we
were
to
grant
on
the
basis
of
no
compelling
evidence
that
guns
are
less
common
in
vancouver
we
might
still
question
what
causes
what
the
authors
attribute
seattles
higher
crime
rate
to
a
higher
rate
of
gun
ownership
but
it
might
well
be
argued
that
low
crime
or
homicide
rates
reduce
the
motivation
for
average
citizens
to
obtain
gunsin
other
words
that
crime
rates
explain
the
variation
in
gun
ownership
not
vice
versa
in
fact
it
was
once
commonly
argued
that
great
britains
low
rate
of
violent
crime
was
a
function
of
that
nations
strict
gun
laws
and
the
consequent
low
rate
of
gun
ownershipuntil
british
researcher
colin
greenwood
found
that
great
britain
had
enjoyed
low
rates
of
violent
crime
for
many
decades
before
strict
firearms
controls
were
enacted
to
invoke
an
ancient
methodological
saw
correlation
is
not
cause
nor
do
the
problems
with
this
study
end
with
its
lack
of
direct
data
on
gun
ownership
the
authors
say
seattle
and
vancouver
are
similar
in
many
ways
implying
that
they
differ
mainly
in
gun
availability
gunlaw
stringency
and
crime
rates
this
is
an
evident
attempt
to
establish
the
ceteris
paribus
condition
of
a
sound
scientific
analysisthat
all
else
is
equal
among
things
being
compared
clearly
the
two
cities
are
similar
in
some
ways
but
a
closer
look
reveals
differences
in
ways
that
are
relevant
to
their
respective
crime
or
homicide
rates
the
cities
are
closely
matched
in
what
percentage
of
their
population
is
white
percent
and
percent
but
seattle
is
about
percent
black
while
vancouver
is
less
than
percent
vancouvers
minority
population
is
overwhelmingly
asian
so
although
the
authors
show
that
th
two
cities
are
approximately
comparable
on
a
half
dozen
readily
available
demographic
indicators
they
have
not
shown
that
all
potentially
relevant
sources
of
variation
have
been
ruled
out
in
fact
the
differences
in
racial
compositions
of
the
two
cities
is
particularly
relevant
in
light
of
the
studys
breakdown
of
homicide
rates
according
to
the
race
of
the
victim
for
the
white
majority
the
homicide
rates
are
nearly
per
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
differing
overall
homicide
rates
in
the
two
cities
are
therefore
due
entirely
to
vastly
different
rates
among
racial
minorities
for
blacks
the
observed
difference
in
homicide
rate
is
to
and
for
hispanics
to
methodoligical
complexities
render
the
asian
comparison
problematic
but
it
too
is
higher
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
racial
minorities
are
much
more
likely
to
be
the
victims
of
homicide
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
white
majority
is
equally
likely
to
be
slain
in
either
city
since
the
nearly
initial
difference
in
homicide
reates
between
the
cities
is
due
exclusively
to
or
differences
between
minority
groups
it
is
fair
to
ask
why
postulated
difference
in
gun
availability
or
gunlaw
strigency
would
matter
so
dramatically
to
minorities
but
not
matter
at
all
to
whites
can
differential
gun
availability
explain
why
blacks
and
hispanicsbut
not
whitesare
so
much
more
likely
to
be
killed
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
studies
in
the
united
states
incidentally
do
not
show
large
or
consistent
racial
differences
in
gun
ownership
or
are
other
explanations
more
plausible
could
the
disparity
between
canadian
and
american
rates
of
poverty
among
racial
minorities
have
anything
to
do
with
it
what
are
the
relative
rates
of
drug
or
alcohol
abuse
of
homelessness
among
each
ctys
minority
population
the
city
of
seattle
runs
the
largest
shelter
for
homeless
men
west
of
the
mississippi
unemployment
among
young
centralcity
nonwhite
men
in
the
united
states
usually
exceeds
percent
what
is
the
comparable
canadian
percentage
the
crucial
point
is
that
canada
and
the
united
states
differ
in
many
ways
as
do
cities
and
population
subgroups
with
the
two
countries
absent
more
detailed
analysis
nearly
any
of
these
many
ways
might
explain
part
or
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
in
gross
comparisons
such
as
those
between
seattle
and
vancouver
all
else
is
not
equal
the
authors
of
this
study
acknowledge
that
racial
patterns
in
homicide
result
in
a
complex
picture
they
do
not
acknowledge
that
the
ensuing
complexities
seriously
undercut
the
main
thrust
of
their
argument
they
also
acknowledge
that
socioeconomic
status
is
probably
an
important
confounding
factor
in
our
comparison
remarking
further
that
blacks
in
vancouver
had
a
slightly
higher
mean
income
in
than
the
rest
of
vancouvers
population
given
the
evidence
presented
in
the
article
it
is
possible
that
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
between
seattle
and
vancouver
results
from
greater
proverty
among
seattles
racial
minorities
but
the
authors
pay
no
further
attention
to
this
possibility
since
detailed
information
about
household
incomes
according
to
race
is
not
available
for
vancouver
the
largely
insurmountable
methodological
difficulties
confronted
in
gross
comparative
studies
of
this
sort
can
be
illustrated
with
as
simple
example
if
one
were
to
take
all
us
couties
and
compare
them
in
terms
of
pervalence
of
gun
ownership
and
crime
or
homicide
rates
one
would
find
an
astonishing
pattern
counties
with
more
guns
have
less
crime
would
one
conclude
from
this
evidence
alone
that
guns
actually
reduce
crime
or
would
one
insist
that
other
variables
also
be
taken
into
account
in
this
example
the
hidden
variable
is
city
size
guns
are
more
common
in
small
towns
and
rural
areas
whereas
crime
is
a
bigcity
problem
if
researchers
failed
to
anticipate
this
variable
or
lacked
the
appropriate
data
to
examine
its
possible
consequences
they
coud
be
very
seriously
misled
in
the
study
at
hand
the
authors
matched
two
cities
for
size
but
not
for
minority
poverty
rates
or
other
hidden
variables
and
their
results
are
impossible

interpret

in

of

to

has
already
been
done
of
the

crime
rates
of
vancouver
british
columbia
and
seattle
washington
cities
with
roughly
the
same
population
urban
economy
geography
and
crime
but
with
decidedly
different
approaches
to
gun
control
actually
they
do
not
have
roughly
the
same
urban
economy
and
extremely
different
ethnic
composition
over
the
sevenyear
study
homicides
occurred
in

homicides
in
vancouver
per
after

for
differences
in
age
and
sex
among
the
populations
the
relative
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
however
if
you
account
for
economic
and
ethnic
differences
the
difference
disappears
completely
seattles
minorities
are
predominatly
poor
while
vancouvers
are
middle
or
upper
class
the
rates
for
whites
in
both
cities
were
found
to
be
identicle
while
the
rate
for
poor
seattle
minorities
was
almost
three
times
as
great
as
for
the
welltodo
minorities
of
vancouver
the
pattern
seems
to
be
one
of
poverty
and
race
relations
not
one
of
gun
control
the
authors
of
the
report
also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by
police
only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
that
is
a
gross
distortion
selfdefense
does
not
mean
killing
the
attacker
there
were
cases
of
civilians
killing
their
attacker
in
selfdefence
but
such
cases
represent
less
that
of
the
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
for
every
case
you
cite
there
were
over
other
cases
of
selfdefence
where
the
crime
was
prevented
but
the
attacker
was
not
killed
by
the
way
is
the
most
conservative
possible
figure
based
on
the
national
crime
surveys
estimate
of
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
each
year
most
other
studies
on
the
subject
put
the
figure
at
to
those
figures
would
imply
less
than
of
sucessful
selfdefences
involve
killing
the
attacker
so
more
correctly
there
over
possibly
as
many
as
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefence
only
of
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
attacker
this
is
a
significant
factor
in
comparison
to
the
homicides
if
memory
serves
homicides
make
up
approximately
of
the
violent
crimes
the
study
considered
so
the
fair
comparison
would
be
homicides
prevented
and
homicides
clearly
the
study
can
not
be
close
to
accurate
since
it
ignored

if
it

by

what
relevance
are
all
homicides
in
this
debate
the
issue
is

no
the
issue
is
reducing

not

if

doesnt

overall
then
is
doesnt

the
issue
even
a
simpleton
knows
that
he
stands
a
better
chance
of
surviving
an
attack
with
a
baseball
bat
does
that
matter
if
assaults
with
a
baseball
bat
become
much
more
common
muggers
using
a
gun
rely
primarily
on
the
threat
of
the
gun
and
rarely
shoot
their
victim
a
mugger
using
a
knife
is
much
more
likely
to
start
by
stabbing
his
victim
in
an
effort
incapacitate
him
so
while
a
knif
may
not
be
as
deadly
as
a
gun
criminals
are
more
likely
to
actually
use
the
knife
as
opposed
to
threatening
the
victim
with
it
it
isnt
at
all
clear
that
replacing
the
criminals
gun
with
a
knife
would
reduce
murders
stabbings
might
just
become
more
common
thats
why
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
overall
not
the
withgun
homicide
rate
it
avoids
the
issue
of
substitution
different
criminal
techinques
of
using
different
weapons
etc
and
measures
what
we
want
to
prevent
murders
as
for
knives
see
my
earlier
post
id
much
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
thanks
face
possibly
however
facing
knifewelding
attackers
isnt
too
common
stabbing
without
warning
and
by
supprise
is
the
usual
tactic
very
few
criminals
shoot
from
cover
it
attracts
to
much
attention
and
they
dont
have
a
chance
to
go
through
your
pockets
overall
id
much
rather
be
threatened
with
a
gun
than
actually
stabbed
with
a
knife
fortunately
the
best
defense
against
a
knife
isnt
another
knife
anyone
trained
in
unarmed
selfdefense
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
disarming
a
knife
assailant
untrained
in
knife
assault
which
probably
means
of
knife
assailants
actually
the
exact
same
statement
is
true
of
guns
training
in
unarmed
selfdefence
will
let
you
disarm
an
untrained
gunman
without
much
problem
you
also
ignore
the
criminals
reaction
the
national
crime
survey
clearly
shows
that
criminals
unarmed
armed
with
a
knife
gun
or
whatever
are
unwilling
to
risk
their
lives
in
a
confrontation
if
faced
with
a
serious
threat
almost
all
prefer
to
leave
and
find
an
easier
target
therefore
using
or
threatening
to
use
as
is
much
more
commonly
the
case
a
weapon
is
the
best
defence
against
an
attacker
regardless
of
how
he
is
armed
knives
however
are
much
less
effective
than
guns
criminals
dont

private

approximately

are

according

only

illegal
manufacture
is
one
the
three
primary
sources
of
machine
guns
and
submachine
guns
used
in
crimes
sumggling
and
theft
from
the
police
and
military
being
the
other
two
washington
dc
police
have
stated
that
if
im
remembering
the
figure
correctly
of
the
guns
they
conficate
were
illegally
built
why
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
buying
a
gun
that
somebody
else
made
cheap
and
is
selling
it
to
you
at
an
exorbitant
markup
it
takes
about
hours
and
a
few
tools
to
make
one
at
least
one
of
reasonable
quality
unless
the
drug
dealer
enjoyes
messing
around
on
a
lathe
say
as
a
hobby
hes
going
to
have
to
pay
someone
anyway
materials
plus
six
hours
of
a
machinists
time
for
something
legal
would
run
about
the
blackmarket
prices
for
guns
are
usually
in
the
to
range
at
least
those
few
ive
seen
cited
in
newspaper
articles
were
the
simple
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
regardless
of
how
easy
it
is
to
make
guns
banning
guns
will
reduce
the
the
number
of
new
guns
and
seriuosly
impede
the
efforts
of
a
killer
intent
on
buying
a
weapon
washington
dc
has
a
total
ban
on
handguns
and
prohibits
assembled
rifles
within
city
limits
its
homicide
rate
is
almost
ten
times
the
national
average
it
is
also
illegal
for
a
dc
resident
to
drive
to
the
virginia
or
maryland
suburbs
and
buy
a
gun
dealers
are
required
by
federal
law
to
check
ids
and
make
sure
the
buyer
isnt
from
another
state
so
the
ban
can
not
be
easily
sidestepped
to
show
why
the
tools
argument
is
the
silliest
i
have
ever
seen
take
an
analogy
from
computer
science
almost
every
computer
science
major
can
write
a
wordprocessor
yet
wecomp
sci
majors
would
willingly
pay
to
bucks
for
a
professional
software
like
wordperfect
why
dont
we
just
all
write
our
own
software
because
it
is
highly
inconvinient
sure
but
it
you
couldnt
buy
one
you
would
write
your
own
in
fact
people
did
write
their
own
years
ago
more
likely
you
would
find
a
friend
who
was
a
particularly
good
programer
and
get
him
give
you
a
copy
of
his
software
is
a
very
bad
example
for
your
case
how
many
people
do
you
know
with
illegal
copies
of
word
processors
if
people
want
something
and
it
isnt
available
or
affordable
legally
they
will
usually
get
it
illegally
same
with
guns
quite
secondly
how
does
one
get
this
gunpowder
for
the
home
made
gun
the
formula
has
been
around
for
half
a
million
years
or
are
you
going
to
restrict
sales
of
sulpher
charcoal
and
saltpeter
thats
alot
cruder
than
modern
smokless
powder
but
it
works
very
well
the
only
real
problems
are
a
reduction
in
energy
so
a
magnum
would
only
be
as
deadly
as
a
and
it
makes
alot
more
smoke
of
course
a
smart
black
marketeer
could
just
make
the
gun
in
and
steal
the
ammunition
from
the
police
the
police
are
often
corruptable
and
things
are
known
to
disappear
from
police
evidence
rooms
and
armories
and
reappear
on
the
streets
if
guns
were
really
that
simple
to
make
the
bosnian
muslims
would
be
very
happy
people
or
is
it
the
case
that
metalworking
tools
are
banned
in
bosnia
deep
sarcasm
perhaps
you
werent
watching
the
news
two
years
ago
but
the
serbs
also
tried
to
invade
slovinia
they
were
driven
out
after
a
few
weeks
by

armed
with

i
dont

many
deer
hunters
would
condone
your
friends
choice
of
rifle
i
must
agree
with
nathan
as
a
deer
hunter
i
find
it
inhumane
to
use
underpowered
weapons
for
deer
hunting
to
kill
cleanly
with
the
little
requires
extremely
good
marksmanship
most
hunting
situations
dont
allow
for
perfect
shots
hunters
should
use
sufficiently
powerful
weapons
to
drop
the
deer
with
a
single
hit
to
the
chest
the
from
the
or
sks
is
adequate
to
this
task
having
similar
ballistics
to
the
familiar
but
the
little
is
very
marginal
in
the
hands
of
the
expert
or
the
lucky
it
will
do
but
hunters
really
should
have
more
respect
for
their
quarry
gary
ill
agree
that
the
popular
gr
loading
for
rem
is
too
small
for
deersized
game
however
if
you
use
a
gr
semispritzer
or
the
sierra
gr
semipointed
bullet
this
would
be
suitable
like
any
round
you
keep
your
shots
within
a
reasonable
range
it
would
still
be
on
the
lower
end
of
what
id
consider
acceptable
performance
especially
those
long

shots
out
west
hunting
monster
mule
deer
the

has

hunting
in
oklahoma
the
is
excellent
for

hunting
and

the
in
particular
is
well
suited
given
its
heavy
barrel
and
heat
shielded
foregrip
add
a
highpower
scope
and
youre
in
dog
heaven
however
i
dont
think
nathan
janette
was
refering
to
the
specific
chambering
of
the
rifle
in
question
maybe
he
thinks
self
loading
rifles
have
no
place
in
deer
hunting
that
may
or
may
not
be
his
opinion
but
many
sportsmen
do
use
self
loading
rifles
and
shotguns
wrongo
nra
man
i
was
definitely
referring
to
the
round
not
the
autoloading
aspect
of
the
rifle
i
have
no
problem
with
responsible
hunting
that
doesnt
include
machine
guns
from
choppers
but
a
semi
is
fine
my
uncle
has
bagged
several
deer
with
gauge
slugs
i
would
prefer
that
a
hunter
use
as
much
of
the
catch
as
possible
and
i
dont
condone
hunting
for
sport
only
imho
of
course
two
questions
you
asserted
that
both
the
and
are
not
suitable
for
real
hunting
if
you
have
no
problem
with
hunting
or
using
self
loading
rifles
for
hunting
why
did
you
say
this
if
not
for
deer
then
what
about
other
smaller
game
when
did

was

given
a

of

you
can
build

in

from

and
electronic
junk
supplies
you
might
have
to
engage
in

to
get
the

but
thats
trivial
compared
to
getting
the
plutonium
the

information
on

design
was
declassified
years

and
can
be
dug
out

any

actually
why
bother
looking
it
up
from
the
material
we
covered
last

in

nuclear

i
could
derive
what
it
would
take
to
build
a

and
as

as
the

i
as
a
chemist
could
synthesize
a

of

from
commonly

chemicals
in

if
i
felt
like
the
electronics
behind
the

and
the

are
a
little
trickier
however
but
not
impossible
using
a
few
tricks
of
the

and
if
i
really
wanted
to
be
nasty
i
could
include
a
core
of
hydrogen

of
course
the
hardest
part
is
getting
the

to

he
actually
was
since
he
came
to
dc
he
has
had
a
greater
turn
over
of
listeners
than
the
grease
has
in
other
words
more
people
get
sick
of
him
sooner
than
they
do
of
the
grease
after
all
saying
vagina
or
penis
on
the
air
is
hilarious
at
first
the
second
time
it
is
still
a
little
funny
but
when
you
do
it
all
the
time
and
at
the
same
time
think
you
are
the
greatest
man
on
the
planet
and
tell
everyone
so
than
you
are
going
to
get
old
really
quick
give
it
up
mark
you
are
wrong
excuse
me
but
if
you
really
new
what
the
show
was
about
youd
know
that
he
doesnt
just
say
vagina
and
penis
and
that
is
how
he
gets
his
ratings
he
also
addresss
real
issues
as
well
as
being
outrageous
i
dont
hear
any
of
these
other
idiots
doing
a
funny
show
and
getting
into
some
serious
topics
at
the
same
time
he
gets
people
to
think
and
entertains
them
at
the
same
time
so
try
listening
to
his
show
a
little
closer
before
you
tell
them
that
they
are
wrong
and
by
the
way
if
he
is
such
a
flash
in
the
pan
why
do
his
ratings
sustain
so
well

see

id
much

face

than

thanks
ive
faced
a
knife
and
i
was
damn
annoyed
i
didnt
have
a
gun
all
the
statistics
in
the
world
didnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
interested
in
cutting
me
fortunately
the

against

anyone
trained
in
unarmed
selfdefense
wont
have
much
of
a

disarming
a

assailant
untrained
in

assault
which
probably
means
of
knife
assailants
anyone
trained
in
selfdefense
unarmed
selfdefense
isnt
for
everyone
whats
more
it
requires
substantially
more
training
to
be
safe
and
effective
than
a
firearm
it
requires
physical
proximity
and
thus
a
greater
threat
to
the
victim
which
is
a
primary
problem
with
stun
guns
you
have
to
actually
touch
your
assailant
unless
youre
very
good
a
large
stronger
assailant
can
simply
ignore
your
blows
long
enough
to
incapacitate
you

nuclear

are
dangerous
radioactive
decay
of
plutonium

uranium
as
well
as
the

in

to
be

can
you

get
more

from
living

having
an
office
in
a

building
than
i
do
standing
next
to
a
power
reactor
at
full
power
or
standing
next
to
a
nuclear
warhead
that
is
armed
look
up
shielding
in
your
dictionary
you
dont
need
six
feet
of
lead
to
make
decent
shielding
your
dead
skin
cell
layer
does
an
excellent
job
on
alpha
particles
and
neutrons
are
slowed
by
mere
water
what
do
you
think
of
you
is
but
whatever
the
neutrons
hit
has
a
good
chance
of
absorbing
the
neutron
and
becoming
radioactive
itself
mostly
that
means
water
turning
into
harmless
heavy
water
but
some
neutrons
would
also
hit
bones
and
the
resulting
harmfull
secondard
radioactives
would
remain
in
the
body
for
decades
i
think
an
unshielded
nuclear
warhead
could
reasonably
be
considered
a
public
health
hazard
as
for
a
shielded
warhead
i
think
a
fair
amount
of
maintaince
is
required
for
it
to
remain
safely
shielded
eg
storage
in
a
dry
temperatureregulated
facility
etc
for
private
ownership
to
be
unregulated
i
think
a
single
individual
must
be
able
not
only
to
keep
the
weapon
but
keep
it
in
a
safe
condition
if
any
random
private
citizen
could
not
properly
keep
maintain
and
store
a
nuclear
weapon
then
some
regulation
is
clearly
appropriate
plus
these
things
have
no
self
defense
purposes
its
kinda
hard
to
justify
their
use
as
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapons
or
at
worst
for
industrial
target
obliteration
translation
cities
and
population
centers
if
the
militia
has
as
its
job
the
overthrow
of
an
illegal
government
they
are
indeed
useful
weapons
to
the
militia
i
disagree
with
this
purpose
the
job
of
the
militia
is
to
defend
themselves
and
their
community
if
you
look
at
the
american
revolution
as
an
example
the
militias
won
by
seperating
themselves
from
and
becoming
independent
of
a
repressive
government
they
didnt
overthrow
it
and
those
communities
canada
and
england
for
example
that
didnt
defend
themselves
were
still
under
that
same
old
regime
if
the
role
of
the
militia
were
offensive
to
go
out
and
destroy
repressive
governments
nuclear
weapons
might
be
appropriate
but
their
jobs
is
defensive
and
nuclear
weapons
arent
suited
for
that
there
is
also
the
question
of
personal
and
collective
arms
the
second
amendment
definately
protects
ownership
of
personal
weapons
since
the
very
nature
of
the
militia
requires
members
to
provide
their
own
arms
but
it
isnt
clear
if
it
covers
other
arms
certainly
not
all
members
would
supply
for
example
a
tank
only
a
few
could
or
if
they
were
to
be
used
effectively
should
however
those
providing
the
heavy
weapons
have
a
disproportionate
control
over
the
militia
and
its
fierpower
the
militias
as
the
framers
envisioned
them
were
extremely
democratic
if
only
of
the
members
supported
the
cause
only
would
respond
to
a
muster
and
the
militias
firepower
would
be
proportionately
reduced
militia
firepower
and
the
popular
will
were
therefore
linked
but
if
a
small
minority
of
the
members
supplied
a
large
fraction
of
the
firepower
in
the
form
of
heavy
weapons
this
would
all
change
the
militias
firepower
would
depend
on
the
will
of
a
small
minority
not
of
the
general
public
worse
that
minority
would
be
quite
different
from
the
general
public
at
the
very
least
they
would
be
much
richer
as
a
result
i
think
the
nature
and
character
of
the
militia
requires
that
each
member
provide
a
roughly
equal
share
of
the
militias
firepower
his
personal
weapons
and
some
equitable
fraction
of
a
squads
heavier
firepower

effort
to
examine
what
it
said
about
selfdefense
with
a
firearm
i
havent
ground
through
much
in
the
way
of
numbers
yet
but
a
couple
of
things
jumped
out
at
me
first
only
and
specify
the
type
of
weapon
used
in
self
defense
and
refer
only
to
weapon
the
second
is
that
while
assaults
rose
about
from
to
wgun
defenses
reported
fell
by
almost
unless
theres
an
explanation
for
this
im
tempted
to
mark
it
as
a
reporting
problem
and
as
such
going
ahead
with
any
examination
of
the
numbers
would
be
a
waste
of
time
anybody
have
an
idea
what
might
have
cause
a
real
difference
and
not
just
a
reporting
difference

really

the

that
they
are

get
passed
are
for
the
good
or
are
they
just
lying
through
their
teeth
and
trying

disarm
the
populace
i
think
that
hci
people
honestly
believe
that
passing
more
gun
control
laws
will
be
in
the
best
interests
of
public
safety
why
do
i
think
this
because
i
used
to
buy
the
hci
line
during
my
freshman
year
their
line
made
so
much
sense
only
people
who
need
guns
should
be
able
to
get
them
and
the
people
who
need
them
are
the
police
and
other
elites
unfortunately
for
us
this
position
is
highly
emotional
and
not
well
thoughtout
they
never
stop
to
think
that
hcis
position
basically
says
that
the
nonelite
are
incompetents
thats
you
and
me
folks
and
that
the
second
amendment
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
hunting
or
other
legitimate
uses
which
excludes
overthrowing
tyrannical
governments
and
defending
yourself
when
the
police
have
proven
they
cant
protect
you
we
all
know
that
the
end
result
regardless
of
the
intention
will
be
to
have
a
much
easier
to
subdue
population
for
the
unnwo
this
is
definitely
a
motivation
of
many
in
power
but
i
wonder
to
what
degree
this
is
planned
vs
just
duped
every
procontrol
person
ive
talked
to
is
always
left
stumped
when
i
simply
argue
the
facts
of
gun
control
that
it
has
yet
to
be
proven
to
lower
crime
rates
and
weapons
terminology
and
im
no
expert
but
explaining
exactly
how
an
evil
semiautomatic
weapon
really
works
does
wonders
i
hvae
personally
found
wellreasoned
arguments
to
be
most
effective
against
the
emotional
procontrol
people
the
trick
is
to
get
them
to
realize
that
the
second
amendment
exists
not
for
hunters
but
for
the
oppressed
and

i

youre

might

my
personal
choice
would
be
a
semiauto
but
revolvers
are
just

if

i
have
been
at

they

their

at

and
they
werent
doing
too
badly

prohibitionists
i
discussed
in
my
interview
annoying
you
so
much
in
the
process
were
lying
third
the
freedom
to
own
and

the

nor

utility
fourth
as
often
happens
with
these
things
the
study
doesnt
support
the
gun
prohibitionists
original
numerical
contentions
anyway
but
simply
adds
a
new
layer
of
spurious
claims
to
an
older
body
of
lies
omissions
and
distortions

sixth
the
fact
that
gun
prohibitionists
have
been
caught
lying
on
countless
occasions
carl
bakal
author
of
no
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
even
confessed
to
it
publicly
makes
the
value
of
this
present
study
dubious

say
the
least
seventh

freedom

and

right
subject
neither

democratic
process
nor

social
utility
eighth
given
your
own
lifelong
service
as
a
federal
bureaucrat
not
to
mention
the
cynical
sophistication
of
your
fiction
you
should
be
better
aware
than
most
people
how
progress
in
designing
studies
to
prove
whatever
you
want
outstrips
our
ability
to
collect
meaningful
data
a
case
in
point
we
might
agree
on
is
the
fact
that
it
took
another
kind
of
prohibitionist
or
years
to
create
studies
proving
that
pornography
causes
crime
more
naive
and
probably
more
honest
efforts
in
the
and
clearly
indicate
the
contrary
ninth
the

human
individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to
arguments
grounded
in
social
utility
tenth
another
reason
to
doubt
all
such
studies
is
that
human
behavior
as
the
austrian
school
of
economics
demonstrates
is
far
too
complex
and
unpredictable
to
be
meaningfully
quantified
the
attempt
to
do
so
and
then
create
public
policy
based
on
the
resulting
pseudoinformation
is
wrecking
our
civilization
eleventh
the
freedom

neither

nor
to

utility
twelfth
the
study
is
also
worthless
because
it
incorporates
figures
for
suicide
which
is
not
necessarily
a
tragedy
but
basically
another
individual
right
sometimes
with
ancillary
social
benefits
if
anything
perhaps
suicide
intervention
should
be
a
criminal
offense
thirteenth
and
finally
the
national
rifle
association
officials
quoted
in
the
article
whatever
their
shortcomings
and
they
are
many
are
correct
in
this
instance
the
study
is
meaningless
because
the
freedom
to
own
and
carry
the
weapon
of
your
choice
is
a
natural
fundamental
and
inalienable
human
individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to
arguments
grounded
in
social
utility
and
because
of
that
adrian
even
if
the
study
were
valid
it
wouldnt
deter
me
from
a
lifelong
personal
objective
of
seeing
that
anyone
can
own
any
weapon
he
or
she
prefers
and
carry
it
however
whenever
and
wherever
he
or
she
desires
without
asking
anybodys
permission
in
this
im
ably
assisted
by
gun
prohibitionists
themselves
whose
yawping
invariably
moves
previously
unarmed
people
to
go
out
and
buy
their
first
gun
while
they
still
can
before
the
gun
control
act
most
of
the
shooting
fraternity
viewed
handguns
incorrectly
as
it
turned
out
as
inaccurate
ineffective
toys
there
probably
werent
six
million
of
them
in
the
whole
country
now
thanks
to
kennedy
metzenbaum
the
bradys
and
their
ilk
americas
greatest
sporting
goods
sales
team
we
probably
manufacture
at
least
that
many
every
year
the
fascinating
datum
is
that
handgun
control
et
al
are
perfectly
aware
of
this
so
i
guess
youll
have
to
ask
them
yourself
what
their
real
motives
are
look
gunmaking
isnt
an
arcane
or
difficult
art
and
by
the
way
its
easier
to
make
a
fully
automatic
weapon
than
a
semiautomatic
the
fact
that
i
can
still
obtain
my
own
weapon
of
preference
the
selfloading
pistol
is
the
only
thing
which
keeps
me
from
pursuing
this
further
even
if
it
were
difficult
there
are
already
a
quarter
billion
firearms
in
america
with
an
estimated
half
life
of
years
possibly
more
for
stainless
steel
guns
are
gonna
be
around
a
long
time
adrian
whether
you
like
it
or
not
as
for
me
to
paraphrase
elmer
keith
regardless
of
what
the
law
provides
or
any
court
decides
im
always
going
to
be
armed
and
i
will
always
work
to
see
that
others
are
as
well
the
bad
news
is
that
there
are
thousands
more
perhaps
even
hundreds
of
thousands
where
i
come
from
we
cant
be
stopped
by
passing
laws
we
can
only
be
forced
to
arm
ourselves
and
others
secretly
and
given
both
the
practical
and
alleged
differences
between
full
automatics
and
semiautomatics
perhaps
more
efficiently
so
whats
the

managed

get
very
rich
off
of
the
smuggling
of
booze
into
this
country
during
the
years
of
prohibition
there
was
a
demand
so
an
entire
industry
formed
to
supply
it
if
alcohol
were
again
banned
today
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to

the
cops
now
rank
just
a
narrow

below

and

in
a
similar
vein
the
amount
of
marijuana
smuggled
into
this

has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its

is
very
low
when
compared
to
cocaine
or
heroin
its
simply
not
worth
the
risk
its
uneconomical
now
most
reefer

domestic
there
is
less
pressure
on
the
domestic
producer
showy
raids
notwithstanding
and
thus
it
is
economical
of

though
domestic

is
now
very

a

you

firearms
tend

it

re

i
wrote
nice
strawman
indeed
the
discussion
is
not
about
whether
there
were
tanks
used
in
sixties
riots
instead
it
is
about
whether
those
tanks
fired
their
main
guns
in
one
of
those
riots
you
claim
they
did
that
claim
is
ludicrous
awesley
replied
i
repeated
what
i
had
been
told
under
what
context
i
had
heard
it
supporting
the
claim
that
tanks
were
indeed
used
in
detroit
in
the
issue
has
never
been
whether
tanks
were
used
in
detroit
in
it
has
been
whether
they
fired
their
main

you
did
not
merely
claim
that
tanks
were
usedyou
claimed
that
they
fired
their
main
guns
to
suppress
sniper
fire
and
that
they
were
quite
effective
at
this
you
continue
to
back
away
from
this
claim
and
defend
something
else
that
nobody
is
disputing
awesley
went
on
i
spent
a
few
minutes
in
a
library
today
found
their
computer
was
down
and
they
dont
have
a

anyway
it
took
about
minutes
to
find

rebellion
and
its
victims
by

on

telling
of
the
death
of
tonia

when
the

it
turned
in

direction
the
shots
came
from

machine
gun
mounted
on
the

belched
fire
into
the
buildings
after
a
short
round
into
the
front
of

the
tank
guns
spit
again
tearing
apart
huge
holes
out
of
the
side
of
the
apartment
well
its
not
the
main
gun
well
its
not
the
main
gun
gee
thats
only
the
entire
point
are
you
now
going
to
admit
that
you
were
wrong
i
wrote
will
i
see
any
pictures
of
tanks
firing

will
i
see
pictures

damaged
by
the
shells
will
i
read
the
reports
of

ill
bet
you
dollar
to
doughnuts
i
wont
it
will
take
more
than
secondhand
accounts
from
a
few
old
national
guard
sergeants
shooting
the
shit
to
convince
me
that
tanks
shelled
american
cities
in
the
sixties
awesley
replied
well
if
you
bothered
to
read
them
it
wouldnt
take
long
at
all
to
find
reports
of
tank
fire
although
not
necessarily
of
the
main
guns
i
will
never
read
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
in
detroit
in
the
riots
there
is
simply
no
way
that
such
an
event
could
have
taken
place
without
it
being
common
knowledge
even
years
later
the
american
military
firing
shells
from
tanks
in
american
cities
on
blacks
would
have
been
big
news
awesley
goes
on
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
and
on
i
dont
expect
to
convince
you
youll
have
to
open
your
mind
and
eyes
and
actually
do
a
little
research
to
be
convinced
one
way
or
the
other
let
me
know
what
you
find
i
already
know
what
you
found
nothing
if
i
claimed
that
the
marines
used
to
launch
rockets
at
buildings
in
trenton
new
jersey
would
you
believe
me
would
you
suspend
judgment
until
you
had
a
chance
to
research
it
or
would
your
bullshit
filters
kick
in
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them

re

my
american
express
card
in
jason

writes
deleted
and
as
far
as
fullyautomatic
weapons
you
can
be
a
lot
better
armed
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
define
armed
better
go
shoot
a
revolver
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
does
one
fires
faster
than
the
other
nope
aside
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usually
not
desirable
sure
it
makes
the
other
guys
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
trying
hitting
anything
with
a
thompson
in
hosemode
this
is
why
the
military
is
limiting
its
now
to
burstfire
simple
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troops
like
to
be
able
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wasteful
of
ammo
something
often
in
short
supply
when
the
enemy
is
plentiful
a
revolver
is
equally
capable
as
a
semiauto
in
the
same
caliber
a
revolver
also
has
the
advantage
that
if
it
misfires
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
a
doubleaction
revolver
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcocked
first
but
will
fire
merely
by
pulling
the
trigger
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotate
to
the
next
round
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safety
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fired
with
an
easy
motion
even
one
handed
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiautos
for

off

into

during

there
was

an

it

just
a

in
a

the

smuggled
into
this

has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its
valueperpound
is
very
low
when
compared

its
simply
not

the

its
uneconomical
now

reefer

there
is
less
pressure
on

producer
showy

and
thus
it

heres
a
question
if
most
marijuana
is
domestic
and
producing
it
here
is
economical
why
would
we
expect
it
to
be
imported
of
note
though
domestic
reefer
is
now
very

so
a
small

goes
a

you

it

done

somebody
thought
it

the

firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
your
assumption
is
that
this
low
dollarpound
area
is
sufficiently
low
as
to
make
gunrunning
unprofitable
on
what
do
you
base
this
and
given
that
smuggling
channels
are
already
established
and
given
the
economies
of

would
it
really
add
significantly
more
expense
to
start
smuggling
firearms
especially
considering
doing
so
would
be
less
hazardous
in
terms
of
getting
caught

all
production
would
have
to
be
local

that
was

you
gotta

the

be

that

would
be
worth
more
than

and
youre
virtually
guaranteed
to
get

past

because
theyd
have

search

which
came
through
its
not

a
matter
of
how

how

are

of

eg

pepper
indoors
is

due
to
the
nature
of
the

using
the

outdoors
in
any

mitigates
its
effectiveness
from
reading
various

it
appears
that
mace
especially
the
mace
available

citizens
is
pretty
ineffective
on
people
under
the
influence
of

or

pepper
spray
appears

be

has
the
inherent
spray
delivery
problem
it
still
does
not

anything

for

if

you
might
have
a

tasars
and
stun
guns

contact
with
skin
for
max
effectiveness
a
jacket
like
a
leather
one
will
mitigate
its
effectiveness
the
user
must
be
extremely
close
to
the
assailent
that
puts
them
at
a
considerable
risk
of
injury
the
user
must
keep
the
stun
gun
in
contact
with
the
assailent
for
some
non

deleted
me
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
david
this
is
the
arms
race
fallacy
that
somehow
bigger
guns
make
an
individual
safer
the
problem
is
that
for
each
corresponding
level
of
offensive
power
the
is
not
an
automatic
level
of
defense
increase
the
problem
is
that
theres
a
sort
of
lethality
threshold
that
once
you
get
past
youre
only
talking
about
a
metter
of
degree
regardless
of
what
cops
are
up
against
theres
really
no
reason
for
the
average
beat
cop
to
have
anything
bigger
than
a
pistol
on
him
as
a
personal
weapon
and
maybe
a
rifle
and
a
shotgun
in
the
cruiser
i
mean
think
about
it
carrying
a
monster
pistol
or
submachinegun
doesnt
make
the
cop
any
less
wounded
if
somebody
shoots
him
a
lot
of
police
departenments
have
switched
to
semiautomatics
as
better
more
reliable
weapons
and
more
stopping
power
but
theres
a
point
of
diminishing
returns
this
is
a
very
very
good
point
who
cares
what
kind
of
gun
youve
got
if
youre
lying
on
the
ground
dead
and
as
far
as
automatics
go
any
gang
member
carrying
around
a
couple
of
automatics
an
incredible
rarity
is
going
to
be
far
more
of
a
menace
to
himself
and
innocent
bystanders
than
anything
he
might
be
tryinh
to
aim
at
one
auto
is
hard
enough
to
control
anybody
who
could
control
two
is
going
to
get
the
police
officer
regardless
of
what
the
police
officer
is
armed
with
more
stuff
deleted
mostly
mine
my
question
is
this
what
would
a
police
officer
gain
from
having
a
submachinegun
or
similar
personal
weapon
that
he
already
doesnt
have
with
a
or
semiautomatic
pistol
i
dont
see
as
how
the
police
should
be
hosing
around
fullauto
fire
nor
has
my
experience
with
police
officers
or
the
stats
regarding
how
many
police
officers
get
killed
by
other
cops
made
me
feel
such
would
be
a
good
idea
precise
fire
is
far
more
preferable
nor
should
they
using
bigger
guns
most
standard
sidearms
have
more
then
sufficient
stopping
power
when
properly
applied
all
more
powerful
weapons
would
do
is
make
the
likelihood
of
death
higher
without
really
giving
police
significantly
more
options
another
very
good
point
that
is
well
taken
it
seems
that
when
lots
of
lead
is
flying
either
the
cops
or
the
gangs
someone
innocent
always
gets
caught
in
the
crossfire

sure
it

just

if

of

something
often

a

stuff

about
how
revolvers
are
just
as
good
as
semiautos
all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
actually
i
dont
watch
those
shows
and
youre
right
at
least
partially
i
dont
know
much
about
handguns
im
more
familiar
with
rifles
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiautos
for
most
things
but
they
introduce
unneccessary
complications
to
something
as
nervewracking
as
an
abrupt
encounter
with
a
lone
criminal

promising

preliminary

that
this
will
be
a

humane
method
for
preventing

of

preliminary
data
regarding
similar

in

do
not
in
any
way
support
the
costeffectiveness
of
this
approach
it
may
be
costeffective
for
deerif
you
quietly
overlook
the
fact
that
the
net
cost
to
the
state
of
deer
hunting
is
negative
ie
a
profit
because
the
majority
of
hunters
pay
for
licences
the
cost
comparisons
are
probably
being
done
assuming
that
people
have
to
be
employed
to
cull
the
animals
which
is
not
in
fact
the
case
you
figure
people
are
going
to
pay
for

to
implant

pellets
or
spread

there
has
been
a
fair
bit
of
discussion
about
this
here
recently
because
the
kangaroo
population
in
the
grounds
of
the
governor
generals
residence
has
now
reached
plague
proportions
despite
the
whines
of
the
rampant
animallibbers
the
most
effective
method
of
controlling
the
population
is
still
considered
to
be
controlled
shooting
so
now
why
should
we
allow
hunting
to
prevent
overpopulation
of
the
deerbearwhatever
sorry
but
that
justification
of
blood
lust
is
now
gone
with
the
wind
once
massproduction
of
this
stuff
begins
animal
populations
can
be
easily
managed
without
a
shot
being
fired
this
leaves
only
the
fact
that
some
people
like
to
go
out
in
the
woods
and
kill
things
some
people
take
satisfaction
imho
legitimate
satisfaction
in
eating
food
that
they
have
harvested
themselves
the
pleasure
derived
from
hunting
is
the
same
as
that
you
get
from
eating
fruit
and
vegetables
grown
in
your
own
garden
and
in
general
game
meat
is
probably
much
freer
of
unpleasant
chemicals
than
what
you
buy
from
the
butcher
or
the
supermarket
that
may
be
a
motivation
but
it
cannot
now
be
justified
expect
peta
and
like
organizations
to
use
this
argument
to
get
hunting
banned
period
by
cannot
now
be
justified
i
guess
you
mean
that
you
personally
dont
see
any
justification
finebut
what
makes
your
opinion
so
important
with
no
legitimate
hunting
with
the
papers
filled
with
stories
of
senseless
murders
i
guess
there
wont
be
a
chance
in

of
building
a
case
for
the

that
will
withstand
either
public

necessity

dont

crap
they

no

no

certainly
the

observations
from
a
naive
norwegian
yup
you
said
it
i
admire
such
honesty
guns
are
made
to
kill
people
not
to
shoot
target
or
to
have
something
more
macho
than
stamps
to
collect
fire
an
anschutz
then
come
back
and
talk
to
us
youre
letting
ignorance
and
possibly
fear
cloud
your
thinking
either
that
or
this
is
sour
grapes
because
we
beat
you
in
the
olympic
shooting
events
funny
youd
think
biathalon
would
be
a
natural
sport
for
the
norse
it
is
more
easy
to
killinjure
someone
with
a
gun
than
with
a
knife
or
a
bat
as
in
baseball
precisely
that
makes
them
the
best
method
of
defense
for
the
citizenry
not
everybody
has
the
time
to
train
with
a
gladius
you
know
but
for
some
reason
those
who
prey
on
others
seem
to
have
more
free
time
to
extend
this
a
bit
further
you
need
only
a
certain
level
of
competence
to
beat
another
with
a
range
weapon
getting
in
their
face
with
a
weapon
and
winning
is
much
more
difficult
and
requires
more
training
time
the
average
citizen
just
does
not
have
ive
spent
a
few
years
practicing
with
a
sword
i
can
take
the
common
person
armed
with
one
though
selfdefense
isnt
the
reason
i
own
one
my
kid
sister
would
have
an
even
chance
of
beating
me
gun
vs
gun
with
only
a
month
of
training
that
makes
firearms
much
better
in
our
eyes
its
not
very
wise
to
compare
two
completely
different
countries
like
usa
and
lets
say
island
on
issues
like
crime
and
violence
excellent
point
perhaps
you
arent
so
naive
after
all
yes
the
problem
is
people
committing
crimes
not
the
tools
beeing
used
but
should
be
taken
into
concideration
taken
into
consideration
in
what
respect
though
quite
wrong
lets
make
it
a
blanket
statement
for
weapons
in
general
this
has
been
taken
into
consideration
we
call
use
of
them
aggrivated
assault
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
assault
with
intent
to
kill
attempted
murder
and
a
whole
host
of
others
and
tack
on
extra
prison
time
we
have
a
very
strict
gunlegislation
in
norway
but
until
recently
it
was
possible
for
enyone
over
years
to
buy
a
shotgun
shotguns
are
used
mainly
for
hunting
in
norway
but
because
it
was
so
easy
to
accuire
one
it
was
the
most
used
gun
in
crimes
in
norway
i
suspect
it
was
about
the
only
weapon
available
you
conquered
your
land
among
others
a
full
millenia
before
we
were
thought
of
and
shortly
thereafter
weapons
werent
quite
so
common
i
suspect
that
a
few
world
wars
made
a
difference
too
since
in
times
of
emergency
weapons
tend
to
be
turned
in
or
donated
to
needy
causes
im
curious
though
were
the
weapons
used
in
the
crimes
bought
shortly
before
the
crime
or
were
they
aquired
by
other
means
any
requirements
other
than
just
registering
the
shotgun
and
unbelievable
the
use
of
guns
in
crime
fell
there
are
now
a
new
law
against
wearing
long
knives
in
public
and
why
should
it
be
allowed
come
on
down

honest
eriks

easy

sorry
i
couldnt
resist
you
guys
still
slicing
each
other
with
long
knives
or
is
this
really
not
a
problem
what
i
as
an
scandinavian
have
problems
to
understand
is
that
you
americans
have
a
more
liberal
view
on
guns
and
violence
than
on
nudity
and
sex
try
showing
a
bare
breast
on
tv
insted
of
violence
and
murder
im
all
for
that
what
gets
me
is
that
scandanavians
and
yes
im
only
a
couple
generations
off
the
longship
used
to
be
some
of
the
most
feared
warriors
on
the
planet
a
mere
millenia
ago
yet
now
seem
to
spend
their
time
sitting
in
spas
and
doing
a
bit
of
topless
sunbathing
maybe
you
had
a
bit
more
time
and
a
more
homogeneous
culture
to
become
civilized
with
yes
i
know
a
little
american
history
but
is
it
a
civilhuman
right
to
have
an
assault
gun
in
your
home
andor
an
handgun
in
your
car
yes
were
too
damned
violent
partially
i
believe
because
we
are
not
a
homogeneous
culture
and
dont
identify
ourselves
as
americans
first
and
foremost
im
rather
proud
of
my
norwegian
and
danish
heritage
whereas
i
suspect
you
couldnt
care
less
about
that
welsh
blood
in
your
veins
thanks
to
a
raid
in
ireland
back
in
the
time
scale
and
the
homogeneous
culture
are
important
equally
important
is
a
basic
philosophical
difference
in
personal
versus
collective
good
in
america
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
personal
liberties
are
prized
above
all
this
is
sadly
changing
of
late
but
i
trust
you
notice
how
this
call
for
freedom
makes
laws
that
restrict
individuals
for
little
collective
benefit
hateful
to
americans
id
hazard
a
guess
that
were
america
less
interested
in
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
more
interested
in
collective
good
we
never
would
have
sent
our
armed
forces
anywhere
one
poor
effect
of
this
culture
we
have
is
that
were
looking
out
for
ourselves
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
identify
with
only
a
small
segment
of
the
population
my
grandmother
tells
of
being
discriminated
against
back
in
denmark
because
she
spoke
low
dane
whereas
others
spoke
high
dane
it
was
shortly
after
world
war
ii
as
i
remember
that
low
dane
was
abolished
so
there
was
one
common
dialect
we
cannot
fathom
such
a
minor
thing
being
a
problem
because
we
have
even
more
obvious
means
of
identifying
an
outsider
the
bad
english
is
not
my
fault
its
probably
the
keyboardsoftware
or
the
quality
of
the
subtext
on

take
heart
yours
is
better
than
of

excerpt
i
posted
it
is
fairly
consistant
with
other
such
polls
finding
that
approximately
of
households
have
at
least
one
firearm
how
this
translates
into
individual
ownership
is
questionable
but
i
think
its
fairly
safe
to
say
that
youre
wrong
about
the
vast
majority
ok
a
nearmajority
actually
own
firearms
but
i
will
still
claim
that
the
vast
majority
never
needs
to
use
them
or
even
threaten
anyone
with
them
what
do
they
do
right
or
are
they
just
lucky
in
either
case
this
means
the
average
threat
level
in
this
country
is
rather
low
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
name
them
the
key
phrase
is
can
be
theories
are
nice
but
practicality
is
more
important
a
taser
to
chose
an
exmpale
outlawed
virtually
everywhere
can
be
as
effective
as
a
gun
under
optimal
conditions
when
dealing
with
your
absolute
average
i
think
you
have
weapons
on
the
brain
i
never
said
that
these
alternative
means
of
selfprotection
involved
any
hardware
why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one

he
was

there
arent

legality

it
would
not

to

them
in

would

there
are

that
many

who
have
both
the

about

with
nonlethal
bullets

rubber

bullets
would
those
work
very
well
in
stopping
an
attack
doug
holland
any
projectile
traveling
at
or
near
typical
bullet
speeds
is
potentially
lethal
even
blanks
which
have
no
projectile
can
cause
death
if
the
muzzle
is
in
close
proximity
to
the
victim
i
have
heard
of
rubber
or
plastic
bullets
being
used
effectively
during
riot
situations
where
the
intent
is
crowd
control
rather
than
close
range
self
defense
ive
also
seen
reports
of
deaths
caused
by
them
the
british
in
northern
ireland
use
of
a
firearm
for
self
defense
is
appropriate
and
lawful
only
in
the
gravest
of
situations
at
that
point
i
consider
deadly
lethal
force
to
be
a
proper
reaction
and
so
does
the
law
furthermore
use
of
less
effective
but
still
potentially
lethal
force
has
its
own
set
of
problems
it
may
well
take
more
applications
of
the
less
effective
force
to
stop
the
incident
this
places
all
parties
at
some
risk
the
victim
because
the
attack
has
not
stopped
and
the
assailent
since
the
aggregate
damage
done
by
the
multiple
applications
may
well
be
more
deadly

more
easy
to
killinjure
someone
with
a
gun
than
with
a
knife
or
a
bat
as
in
baseball
its
not
very
wise
to
compare
two
completely
different
countries
like
usa
and
lets
say
island
on
issues
like
crime
and
violence
yes
the
problem
is
people
committing
crimes
not
the
tools
beeing
used
but
should
be
taken
into
concideration
only
as
far
as
it
affects
the
crime
rate
we
have
a
very
strict
gunlegislation
in
norway
but
until
recently
it
was
possible
for
enyone
over
years
to
buy
a
shotgun
shotguns
are
used
mainly
for
hunting
in
norway
but
because
it
was
so
easy
to
accuire
one
it
was
the
most
used
gun
in
crimes
the
solution
was
to
restrict
the
sale
so
its
now
necessary
to
apply
and
register
your
shotgun
and
unbelievable
the
use
of
guns
in
crime
fell
did
the
rate
of
crime
fall
if
not
the
ban
was
of
no
use
it
is
the
rate
of
violent
crime
that
matters
not
the
tools
used
its
the
crime
stupid
there
are
now
a
new
law
against
wearing
long
knives
in
public
and
why
should
it
be
allowed
apparently
that
became
the
weapon
of
choice
after
the
shotguns
were
banned
after
that
theyll
decide
the
car
of
choice
is
the
saab
and
propose
a
ban
on
that
what
i
as
an
scandinavian
have
problems
to
understand
is
that
you
americans
have
a
more
liberal
view
on
guns
and
violence
than
on
nudity
and
sex
try
showing
a
bare
breast
on
tv
insted
of
violence
and
murder
yes
i
know
a
little
american
history
but
is
it
a
civilhuman
right
to
have
an
assault
gun
in
your
home
andor
an
handgun
in
your

yes
we
still
trust
honest
people

not
my

the

recently

granted
the

may
be
asking

i
to
help
out

but
in
the
big
scope
of
things
i
feel
that
we
would
do
all
gun
owners
a
favor
by
helping
to
this
cause
anyway
here
it
is
newspaper

censorship
are
you
letting
the
newspapers
tell
you
how
to
live
your
life
whats
good
for
you
whats
not
and
exercise
blatant
censorship
over
what
you
read
in
their
advertisments
the
newspapers
have
now
decided
to
censor
gun
ads
which
is
why
you
no
longer
see
the
ads
that
traders
san
leandro
has
run
for
many
years
these
ads
were
run
for
the
lawabiding
honest
citizens
who
own
firearms
for
sporting
use
or
selfprotection
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
so
under

right

if

yet
refuse

please

how

american

the

conquer
the

so
on
for
six

so
now
we
have
the

trying

put
gun
dealers
out

business
by
trying

what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
i
dont
know
where
you
are
originally
from
david
but
you
live
in
tennesse
and
i
live
in
chicago
and
see
this
crap
everyday
on
the
news
and
in
the
papers
i
think
the
situation
is
just
a
tad
different
here
than
there
however
dont
forget
that
the
police
in
chicago
can
carry
just
about
anything
they
want
except
for
the
glock
which
is
not
approved
for
carry
guess
they
figure
all
cops
are
like
the
police
chief
of
winnetka
who
happened
to
let
off
a
stray
round
of
this
is
the
same
antigun
police
chief
that
wanted
fullauto
uzis
for
his
patrol
cars
perhaps
in
the
judgement
of
the
majority
of
chicagos
finest
a
closeto
reliable
weapon
like
a
revolver
is
preferable
to
a
reliable
automatic
i
note
that
in
germany
where
certainly
the
semiauto
handgun
is
king
some
of
the
more
elite
police
types
want
revolvers
i
dont
think
the
issue
is
cost
because
chicago
police
certainly
make
on
the
order
of
at
least
your
presumption
of
disadvantage
i
think
is
not
borne
out
by
the
experiences
of
new
york
citys
cops
there
the
cops
usually
come
out
on

i
think
most
of
us
would
rather
be
held
up
with
a
knife
than
with
a
gun
but
how
the
hell
are
you
going
to
manage
that
you
still
havent
offered
ive
been
watching
this
knife
verses
gun
bit
for
a
while
now
even
contributed
a
few
comments
but
this
stuff
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
has
got
to
come
from
ignorance
i
used
to
think
pretty
much
the
same
thing
then
i
got
educated
people
do
not
as
a
rule
understand
how
deadly
knives
can
be
or
how
quickly
you
can
be
killed
with
one
most
people
dont
understand
that
it
takes
less
than
an
inch
of
penetration
in
some
areas
to
cause
quick
within
a
minute
or
so
death
the
death
rates
from
handguns
and
knives
are
within
a
few
percentage
points
of
each
other
many
people
not
realizing
how
deadly
knives
are
try
their
luck
and
thus
more
get
injured
by
knives
a
gun
is
deadly
only
in
a
single
direction
and
its
only
advantage
is
that
it
is
a
remote
control
weapon
a
contact
weapon
such
as
a
knife
controls
a
spherical
area
to
feet
in
diameter
most
people
have
never
seen
knife
wounds
aside
from
slicing
a
finger
by
accident
from
feet
or
so
a
knife
is
very
nearly
an
even
match
for
a
holstered
gun
in
experienced
hands
even
if
the
knife
wielder
has
only
moderate
skill
from
inside
feet
or
so
a
knife
is
a
match
for
a
drawn
gun
a
knife
is
utterly
silent
it
never
jams
and
never
runs
out
of
ammunition
it
is
limited
only
by
the
speed
dexterity
skill
and
ability
of
its
wielder
criminals
in
general
are
young
fast
and
strong
its
interesting
to
note
that
the
patterned
slashing
attacks
used
by
many
martial
artists
remarkably
resemble
the
wild
uncontrolled
slashing
attacks
of
novices
ive
talked
to
several
well
trained
martial
artists
they
have
unanimously
agreed
that
if
they
ever
go
up
against
a
knife
they
simply
plan
on
being
cut
hopefully
not
as
bad
as
the
attacker
practicing
with
firearms
requires
facilities
and
equipment
practicing
with
knives
requires
only
a
small
area
and
something
to
simulate
a
knife
say
a
popsicle
stick
or
tooth
brush
criminals
practice
their
knife
attacks
in
prison
if
you
have
not
trained
against
knives
with
a
firearm
and
do
not
realize
these
facts
the
first
inkling
you
will
have
that
something
is
wrong
is
the
knife
ripping
through
your
throat
or
in
the
case
of
an
experienced
attacker
parts
of
your
body
falling
off
onto
the
ground
a
year
old
man
with
arthritis
can
close
that
yard
distance

seconds
dennis

with

leg
in

cast
managed

ive
seen
people
close

and
strike
in

slow
i
can
do

in
seconds
ive
seen
morgue
footage
of
people
killed
with
edged
weapons
that
you
would
not
believe
how
about
a
single
stab
wound
to
the
chest
with
a
table
fork
in
this
case
the
attacker
used
the
handle
not
the
pointed
end
add
to
this
the
fact
that
hand
gun
stopping
power
is
largely
a
myth
except
in
the
case
of
a
central
nervous
system
shot
or
a
round
that
destroys
the
skeletal
structure
it
takes
anywhere
from
to
twelve
seconds
for
a
bullet
wound
to
take
effect
this
is
true
of
even
heart
shots
there
is
the
case
of
the
police
woman
in
la
the
first
recorded
survivor
of
a
shot
to
the
heart
that
lady
not
only
killed
her
attacker
but
chased
him
down
to
do
it
all
four
of
her
shots
fired
after
she
had
been
shot
struck
the
perp
atta
girl
the
bullet
entered
her
on
a
downward
angle
went
through
the
apex
of
her
heart
down
through
the
diaphragm
clipped
her
liver
and
destroyed
her
spleen
it
then
exited
her
back
leaving
a
tennis
ball
sized
hole
she
died
about
six
times
on
the
operating
table
but
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
days
and
was
back
on
full
duty
in
eight
months
she
was
off
duty
at
the
time
and
not
wearing
her
vest
she
was
on
her
way
home
so
happened
to
have
her
gun
no
she
doesnt
think
civilians
should
have
the
same
rights
sigh
the
moral
of
the
story
is
that
even
if
you
do
manage
to
shoot
a
knife
attacker
youd
better
be
planning
on
doing
some
dodging
a
good
alternative
is
to
shoot
for
and
break
the
pelvis
people
can
often
walk
a
little
on
broken
legs
but
a
broken
pelvis
will
nearly
always
anchor
them
many
firearms
schools
recommend
pelvis
shots
against
contact
weapons
the
target
is
as
large
as
the
traditional
center
of
mass
and
is
more
reliable
to
stop
somebody
with
a
contact
weapon
assuming
a
caliber
powerful
enough
to
do
the
job
hot
on
up
will
usually
do
this
remember
folks
the
idea
isnt
to
take
em
with
you
but
for
you
to
live
and
them
to
fail
whatever
the
consequences
for
them
this
the
reason
killing
them
isnt
our
goal
or
in
many
cases
even
good
enough
to
keep
us
alive
i
dont
want
to
face
a
violent
attack
of
any
sort
knowing
what
i
now
know
i
cant
rightly
say
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
an
gun
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
attacker
and
if
i
could
pick
and
choose
i
wouldnt
be
there
this
is
really
the
bottom
line
criminals
do
not
fear
the
law
criminals
do
not
fear
the
weapon
they
fear
the
citizen
behind
the
weapon
that
has
shown
the
resolution
and
determination
to
do
whatever
it
takes

new

this

everything
is
dependent

usually
political
to
imagine
that
inalienable

are
somehow
wired

is
purest
egotism

a
dangerous

some

the

the

the

factor
given
society

we

experience
it
it
seems
safer
to
get

that

be
an
error
but
enough
active

believe

if

then
certain

actually
the
words

is
a

used
as
an
adjective
to

which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
the

verb

it
asserts
that
the

is
essential
for
maintaining
a
milita
a

yes
i
agree
the
first
half
of
the
amendment
does
modify
the
noun
militia
but
the
difinition
of
modify
that
applies
to
how
well
regulated
modifies
militia
is
to
qualify
or
limit
the
meaning
of
for
example
wet
modifes
day
in
the
phrase
a
wet

the
amendment
is
similiar
to
the
statement
a
wet
day
being
annoying
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep

wear
boots
shall

so
how
does
a

pertain
the
right
to
use
boots
similiar
what
does
the
unorganized
militia
have
to
due
with
the
right
to
own
guns
the
sentence
in
the
second
amendment
doesnt
restrict
the
right
or
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
by
anyone
or
anything
other

all
it

make

the
people
as
in

and
me
as
in
the
first
fourth
ninth
tenth
as
well
as
the
second

the
existence
of
this

is

it
is
not

by

there
is
no
stated

condition
relating
the

to
the
necessity
of
a

to
the
security

the
entire

says
that
the
right
to
keep

is

no
not
unconditional
but
shall

infringed
is
defined
as

as

the
word
unconditional
implies
no

the
opposite
the
words
used

are

are

they
clearly

says
congress

the

a

my

is
so
what
is
mr

arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
mox
nix

you
are

last

hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
youre
getting
warmer
the
little
thing
in
the
trigger
has
to
be
depressed
before
the
trigger
can
move
what
this
means
is
the
damned
thing
wont
go
off
until
the
trigger
is
pulled
this
makes
it
just
about
there
have
been
some
problems
but
were
assuming
the
gun
is
functioning
correctly
as
safe
as
a
revolver
the
gun
when
working
correctly
is
totally
drop
safe
now
in
police
work
this
is
a
consideration
there
is
not
a
single
documented
case
im
aware
of
where
a
police
officer
was
killed
because
he
failed
to
operate
the
safety
on
his
firearm
there
are
quite
a
few
documented
cases
where
criminals
got
hold
of
the
cops
gun
and
couldnt
figure
out
how
to
get
the
safety
off
in
time
to
use
the
gun
thus
the
proprietary
nature
of
the
safety
to
the
criminal
at
least
very
likely
prevented
the
office
from
getting
shot
the
purpose
of
a
safety
is
to
make
the
gun
safe
from
unintentional
fire
this
does
not
mean
it
should
be
so
complicated
as
to
slow
down
intentional
use
thus
the
glock
safety
is
perfectly
adequate
from
a
safety
standpoint
but
not
necessarily
the
most
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
open
carry
where
it
is
easily
grabbed
by
somebody
else
by
this
criteria
it
does
make
a
lot
of
sense
as
a
concealed
carry
piece
from
the
standpoint
of
police
use
it
is
no
better
or
worse
than
a
revolver
as
far
as
being
proprietary
to
the
officer
in
the
method
of
firing
it
the
ideal
solution
may
someday
be
biometric
sensing
of
the
user
so
that
the
firearm
cant
be
used
by
anybody
but
its
owner
but
for
now
the
wide
variety
of
safety
systems
helps
unless
the
criminal
happens
to
be
familiar
with
that
particular
type
of
firearm

am
apr
this
isnt
recguns
so
maybe
this
is
getting
a
bet
technical
but
i
cant
resist
a
revolver
also
has
the
advantage
that
if
it
misfires
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
sometimes
depends
on
why
it
misfired
a
doubleaction
revolver
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcocked
first
but
will
fire
merely
by
pulling
the
trigger
i
cant
imagine
doing
much
combat
type
shooting
single
action
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotate
to
the
next
round
assuming
the
cylinder
will
rotate
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safety
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fired
with
an
easy
motion
even
one
handed
never
hurts
to
err
on
the
side
of
safety
but
if
youve
got
one
of
those
new
fangled
hammer
blocks
or
transfer
bar
safeties
its
unnecessarily
redundant
id
rather
have
the
extra
round
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
quite
true
speed
loaders
are
a
little
less
convenient
to
pack
around
than
magazines
though
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
true
but
this
is
a
training
function
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
cocked
and
locked
for
single
actions
or
hammer
down
on
double
actions
are
the
only
carry
modes
that
make
sense
the
series
colts
for
example
are
quite
safe
to
carry
this
way
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
agreed
now
that
ive
shot
off
my
mouth
a
bit
let
me
back
some
of
this
up
it
is
true
that
a
simple
misfire
on
a
revolver
doesnt
cost
you
much
on
the
other
hand
ive
had
all
sorts
of
interesting
things
happen
over
the
years
for
example
ive
had
factory
ammunition
that
has
had
high
primers
a
high
primer
will
tie
your
revolver
up
somewhere
from
seconds
to
minutes
while
you
try
to
pound
the
action
open
to
clear
the
problem
an
auto
jack
the
slide
and
continue
ive
had
bullets
come
out
of
the
case
keeping
the
cylinder
from
turning
see
clearing
paragraph
above
about
the
worst
that
can
happen
with
a
semi
auto
is
a
double
feed
this
can
be
cleared
in
seconds
most
revolvers
are
more
fragile
then
semi
autos
there
are
all
sorts
of
close
tolerance
parts
and
fitting
involved
dropping
the
gun
or
a
blow
to
the
gun
or
all
sorts
of
things
can
take
it
out
of
action
many
of
the
problems
that
can
be
cured
on
the
spot
with
a
quality
semi
auto
take
a
gun
smith
for
a
revolver
in
short
a
revolver
may
be
less
likely
to
malfunction
but
as
a
rule
when
it
does
youre
out
of
the
fight
the
majority
of
malfunctions
that
occur
with
semi
autos
does
not
fall
into
that
category
vincint
makes
many
good
points
in
this
post
but
leaves
off
the
opposing
view
of
most
of
them
a
real
good
starting
place
is
ayoobs
the
semi
auto
pistol
for
police
and
self
defense
in
general
id
agree
the
revolver
is
an
excellent
first
gun
and
self
defense
weapon
for
somebody
that
does
not
have
the
time
and
inclination
that
is
necessary
for
the
training
and
practice
needed
to
use
a
semi
auto
effectively
as
a
self
defense
arm
most
cops
are
notoriously
indifferent
to
firearms
if
the
department
isnt
going
to
train
them
they
arent
going
to
take
the
time
on
their
own
there
is
no
doubt
that
training
is
an
issue
the
amount
of
training
required
for
effective
use
of
a
semi
auto
is
probably
several
times
that
of
a
revolver
many
cops
dont
bother
for
myself
id
hate
to
be
limited
to
one
or
the
other
id
rather
pick
what
fits
better
with
my
personal
inclination
what
im
wearing
that
day
and
so
on
like
the
moderator

says
buy
em
all
that
said
i
have
to
admit
that
often
my
advice
to
people
thinking
of
buying
their
first
defense
arm
is
right

taking

get
a
ruger

revolver

the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
you
define
vast
majority
you
are
correct
about
majority
somewhere
between
out
of
three
and
one
out
of
will
at
some
period
in
their
lives
experience
a
violent
assault
the
risk
is
generally
higher
than
emergency
medical
problems
like
heart
attack
and
stroke
vast
is
probably
too
loose
a
term
with
approximately
americans
using
firearms
each
year
over
a
year
period
we
get
roughly
since
some
may
have
to
do
this
more
than
once
million
americans
with
experience
in
using
firearms
for
self
defense
yields
percent
of
the
population
yes
i
know
that
is
a
real
rough
estimate
were
closer
to
million
now
but
many
of
these
are
minors
and
should
be
included
etc
thus
the
percentage
if
anything
is
low
at
any
rate
most
minority
groups
in
this
range
are
not
usually
referred
to
as
tiny
minorities
so
i
dont
see
how
the
other
part
of
the
group
can
be
referred
to
as
the
vast
majority
a
little
more
work
might
support
a
simple
majority
of
americans
never
use
own
or
display
a
firearm
certainly
when
you
are
talking
about
ownership
you
are
wrong
nearly
half
of
your
fellow
citizens
own
one
or
more
firearms
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
provide
a
list
of
other
means
that
are
as
effective
then
you
might
convince
your
local
police
departments
to
switch

cdtswstratuscom
c

tavares
writes
again
my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
ill
point
out
that
the
whole
point
of
the
difficult
amendment
process
was
to
require
a
supermajority
to
change
the
supreme
law
making
it
impossible
for
a
majority
of
the
people
to
simply
change
the
law
on
a
whim
simply
changing
the
meaning
based
on
the
representatives
of
the
people
effectively
destroys
the
amendment
process
the
states
you
know
are
also
entitled
to
a
say
under
that
process
mox
nix
mr
rutledge
you
are
the
only
one
here
claiming
that
the
rkba
is
dependent
on
the
existence
of
a
topflight
wellregulated
militia
why
this
is
a
false
assumption
has
already
been
posted
a
number
of
times
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
ill
note
that
that
right
could
be
considered
protected
under
the
first
amendments
protection
of
peaceful
assembly
unless
you
would
consider
a
militia
inherently
nonpeaceful
then
theyve
stated
the
same
thing
twice

remeber
being

washington
and
seeing
a
pickup
truck
in
front
of
the
car
that
my
friend
and
i
were
in
it
had
a
bumper
sticker
proclaiming
gun
control
is
a
firm
grip
on
a
now
im
sure
that
that
wanker
thought
he
was
pretty
cool
what
he
didnt
realize
was
that
we
took
a
photo
of
the
back
of
his
truck
and
showed
it
to
our
friends
when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in

in

you
have
to
realize
the

goes
both

canadians
laugh
at

and
americans
simply
shrug
and
woner
why
the
hell
we
let
them
be
a
state
in
the
first

i
knew
somebody
else
who
went
to
one
of
your
gunmart
superstore
places
just
so
he
could
experience
the
sight
of
people
putting
guns
and
ammo
into
shopping
carts
i
didnt
believe
it
myself
until
i
drove
by
one
in

last
year
interesting
strategy
posting
here
with
complaints
about
people
elsewhere
now
that
i
live
in

i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the

world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
courtesy
is
apparently
a
dead
commodity
in
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
gun
nut
morons
indeed
the
bbc
recently
referred
to
the
american
penchant
for
pistols
automatic
weaponsetc
very
appropriately
it
was
called
a
national
eccentricity
weve
got
guns
theyve
got
a
monarch
and
an
economy
on
the
verg
of
collapse
finger
pointing
across
the
atlanticis
a
waste
or
time
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
canada
has
been
blaming
the
us
for
their
problems
for
years
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
ten
years
ago
they
crowed
about
how
great
their
system
was
because
theyd
gotten
rid
of
the
guns
and
the
us
would
be
so
much
better
if
theyd
just
get
into
the
divine
light
shining
from
the
north
we
pointed
out
that
it
was
cultural
differences
and
pointed
to
their
precontrol
crime
rates
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
history
of
the
entire
world
contained
smuggling
and
that
whenever
something
was
wanted
it
was
smuggled
in
if
the
problem
were
based
on
us
guns
it
would
have
surfaced
years
before
now
more
canadian
criminals
want
guns
and
they
are
being
provided
canada
has
its
own
version
of
the
drug
problem
yet
drugs
are
prohibited
in
the
us
hell
here
in
britain
the
cops
dont
even
carry
guns
thats
another
funny
thing
you
see
a
us
border
guard
and
hes
got
his
or
on
his
belt
with
tons
o
spare
ammo
never
know
maybe
some
canadian
shopper
might
get
out
of
hand
hell
as
i
recall
in
peoples
court
even
rusty
carried
a
gun
never
know
some
plaintiff
might
go
nuts
saw
a
news
report
out
of
britain
that
armed
crime
is
on
the
rise
and
several
police
agencies
are
considering
have
permanent
firearms
officers
to
deal
with
it
according
to
us
news
world
report
british
handgun
deaths
have
risen
over
over
the
past
twelve
years
the
us
number
has
dropped
maybe
theyre
smuggling
them
across
the
usuk
border
yeah
thats
the
ticket
cya
have
a
nice
day

there
are
a

of

but
atleast
there
is
some
regulation
to
try
to
combat
this
when
i
got
my
drivers
license
i
had
to
take
a
drivers
safety
class
tennessee
at
least
does
not
require
any
sort
of
safety
class
to
get
a
drivers
license
all
that
is
required
is
one
twenty
question
quiz
and
to
drive
a
car
around
the
block
without
crashing
i
have
to
be
licensed
to
drive
in
all
probability
no
you
dont
you
are
required
to
be
licensed
to
drive
on
public
roads
a
license
is
not
necessary
on
private
property
my
car
must
be
registered
most
states
do
not
require
the
registration
of
cars
that
are
not
used
on
public
roads
those
that
do
california
i
know
of
do
so
for
tax
purposes
more
than
anything
else
i
must
at
least
where
i
live
have
liability
insurance
on
both
myself
driving
and
my
car
if
someone
else
had
an
accident
with
it
many
states
do
not
currently
require
this
and
most
again
only
make
this
requirement
for
public
roads
a
car
sitting
unused
is
not
required
to
have
insurance
hmm
wouldnt
manditory
saftey
classes
registration
of
both
the
owner
and
gun
and
manditory
liability
insurance
be
nice
for
gun
owners
the
two
are
not
the
same
as
i
pointed
out
above
there
are
significant
difference
between
making
rules
for
use
on
public
property
and
making
rules
for
ownership
the
other
half
of
the
objection
is
trust
similar
things
to
this
have
been
tried
in
many
local
jurisdications
across
the
country
and
have
been
abused
in
far
too
many
cases
safety
classes
which
are
never
sheduled
never
funded
or
only
one
or
two
is
held
a
year
for
a
limited
number
of
participants
registration
lists
in
new
york
chicago
and
california
have
been
used
for
confiscation
many
gun
owners
would
in
theory
support
these
planes
although
the
numbers
overwhelmingly
show
that
competence
is
not
the
problem
that
intentional
misuse
is
theyve
simply
seen
it
abused
and
are
leery
of
the
next
person
who
comes
down
the
pike
with
a

hi
in
canada
any
gun
that
enters
a
national
park
must
be
sealed
i
think
its
a
small
metal
tag
thats
placed
over
the
trigger
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
from
bears
or
psychos
in
the
national
parks
instead
one
has
to
be
sensitive
to
the
dangers
and
annoyances
of
hiking
in
bear
country
and
take
the
appropriate
precautions
i
think
this
policy
makes
the
users
of
the
national
parks
feel
a
little
closer
to
nature
that
they
are
a
part
of
nature
and
as
such
have
to
deal
with
nature
on
its
own
terms
guy
hello
i
understand
this
philosophy
the
bears
are
a
national
treasure
the
area
is
their
sanctuary
and
people
who
enter
it
do
so
at
their
own
risk
it
is
better
that
that
rare
human
be
killed
by
a
bear
than
that
bears
be
provoked
or
shot
by
unbearsavvy
visitors
the
bears
arent
having
a
population
explosion
humans
are
so
it
is
better
that
a
human
be
killed
than
endanger
the
bears
i
dont
agree
with
this
philosopy
but
i
understand
it
the
psychos
are
a
bit
different
they
are
not
a
national
treasure
but
i
suppose
the
decision
has
been
made
that
to
allow
provision
for
defense
against
them
would
also
allow
provision
for
defense
against
bears
again
i
suppose
it
has
been
decided
that
it
is
better
for
the
rare
human
to
be
killed
by
a
psycho
than
to
take
a
chance
on
threatening
the
bears
personally
i
wouldnt
go
into
an
area
where
i
would
be
managed
so
as
to
reduce
my
safety
but
come
to
think
of
it
i
guess
i
live
in
a

the

it

the

they

coverage
hmm
wouldnt
manditory
saftey

registration
of
both
the
owner
and
gun
and
manditory
liability
insurance
be
nice
for
gun
owners
i
object
to
mandatory
registration
because
i
dont
trust
my
government
not
to
use
any
information
i
give
them
for
their
own
purposes
i
am
licensed
to
carry
a
concealed
pistol
in
my
home
state
but
they
never
asked
whether
i
actually
owned
a
firearm
a
safety
class
before
issuing
a
permit
to
carry
is
reasonably
provided
such
classes
are
regularly
available
to
the
public
of
course
most
places
would
consider
my
time
in
the
reserves
and
on
a
competition
rifle
team
to
count
perhaps
if
it
gave
them
permission
to
shoot
in

hey

now
unless
you
have
an

against
private
ownership
of

why
would
you
want
to
harass
the
person
trying

legally
defend
themselves
or
exercise
their

i
know
defending

is

at

as

as
my

i
are

also
as

dont

ive
already

comparing
the
us
with
other
countries
seldom
works
but
the
european
attitude
towards
alchohol
and
dui
seems
to
work
their
attitude
towards
weapons
isnt
really
a
valid
comparison
because
theyve
historically
done
their
best
to
keep
the
populace
disarmed
and
submissive
while
our
country
was
founded
by
a
bunch
of
rugged
individualists
who
told
the
european
monarchies
for
the
most
part
to
take
a
flying
leap
used
more
polite
language
though
we
even
weaseled
out
of
our
first
international
treaty
and
then
convinced
the
french
that
it
was
in
their
best
interests
not
to
complain
but
first
we
had
to
overcome
the
fact
that
the
brits
were
doing
their
best
to
restrict
us
to
squirrel
guns
and
such
so
wed
be
properly
submissive
while
they
forced
us
to
pay
for
their

i
have
a
question
about
the
second

that
has
bothered
me
for
awhile
the
amendment
guarentees
our
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
currently
the
gun
prohibitionists
are
trying
to
restrict
or
eliminate
our
right
to
keep
arms
with
the
brady
bill
and
the
assault
weapon
ban
however
havent
we
already
lost
our
right
to
bear
arms
it
seems
that
in
most
states
like
texas
a
citizen
may
own
a
gun
and
carry
while
at
his
home
or
business
but
a
citizen
is
severely
restricted
from
bearing
outside
these
areas
here
in
texas
you
cannot
carry
in
your
car
except
when
traveling
which
is
usually
defined
as
traveling
across
a
county
line
how
did
this
come
about
are
there
any
court
rulings
on
the
legality
of
restricting
the
carrying
of
a
weapon
outside
the
home
there
are
but
not
any
that
would
help
texans
in
many
states
such
laws
have
been
found
to
violate
the
state
constitution
but
the
federal
second
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states
it
was
written
to
limit
the
federal
government
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
written
to
extend
the
restrictions
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
state
level
however
the
exact
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
vague
the
supreme
court
has
been
dancing
around
the
issue
without
facing
it
directly
for
over
years
in
practice
the
bill
of
right
indirectly
applies
through
the
fourteenth
applies
to
the
state
governments
only
if
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
particular

the

points

the

according

only

if
thats
the
point
of

to
prevent
criminals
from
legally
purchasing
guns
then
america
doesnt
need
any

to
accomplish
this
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that

can

they

guns
how
is
this
any
different
from
guns
there
are
legal
purposes
for
owning
and
using
a
gun
they
are
appropriate
tools
for
hunting
target
shooting
and
selfdefence
like
cars
murder
isnt
their
only
or
even
a
common
use
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
i
certainly
couldnt
imagine
the
american
public
accepting
regulation
of
axes
while
the
politics
of
other
nations
may
be
different
in
america
there
is
strong
opposition
to
any

primarily
would

at

what

do
about

if
everybody
buys

to

from

what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a

in
usa
there
are
according
to
surveys
guns
in
of
american
homes
in
many
parts
of

this
is
closer
to
those
places
where
almost

gun
owners

they

i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
as
a
data
point
from
tennessee
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
police
officer
essentially
recommends
that
if
you
can
fade
away
even
if
you
were
perfectly
justified
youre
likely
in
for
a
great
deal
of
hassle
a
side
note
carrying
a
gun
concealed
is
a
misdemeanor
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed
and
waited
and
it
was
a
first
offense
what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
its
one
of
those
by
state
things
pretty
much

i

clinton
has
a

ahead
of

if
he
thinks
hes
going
to
pass
some
comprehensive

he
will
sign
the

if
it
gets
to
his

we
will
do
whatever
we
can
to
either
keep
that
from
happening
or
modify
it
such
that
it
is
acceptable
to
us
you
had
better
discover
ways
to
make
do
without
firearms
sorry
thats
not
possible
and
thats
why
we
wont
give
them
up
either
legally
or
illegally
americans
will
keep
their
firearms
the
number
of
unregistered
weapons
in
new
york
city
is
in
the
millions
there
arent
even
close
to
that
number
of
violent
criminals
there
the
number
of
cases
of
firearms
abuses
has
ruined
your
cause
if
the
govt
was
serious
about
stopping
violent
crime
they
would
keep
violent
criminals
in
jail
for
a
long
long
time
where
they
belong
instead
of
letting
them
out
on
early
release
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
hey
we
can
go
into
politics
too
if
we
feel
like
it
those
who
live

by

dont

this

take
advice
on

from
a
brit
no

surrender
your

soon
enough
officers
will
be
around
to
collect

resistance
is
useless
you
watch

actually
this
is
an
understandable
attitude
from
a

you
are
a

of

they
will
overwhelm
you
one
at
a

not
necessarily
there
are
ways
of
resisting
oppression
without
getting
caught
by
the
govt
your
neighbors
will
not
help
you
they
will
consider
you
more
if
an
immediate
threat
than
the
abstract
criminal
the
abstract
criminal
like
the
ones
who
killed
a

while
she
was

in

too
fucking
bad
you
have
gone
the
way
of
the
kkk
violent
solutions
are
passe
while
undesirable
they
are
sometimes
unavoidable
if
you
dont
want
to
resist
a
criminal
attack
by
all
means
do
nothing
i
will
a
take
my
chances
resisting
violent
attack
and
b
stand
a
better
chance
of
being
unharmed
than
someone
who
does
nothing
avoid
situations
which
encourage
criminals
then
you
will
be
as
safe
as
possible
such
as
it
is
what
a
joke
criminals
want
a
disarmed
population
how
can
you
keep

from

abuse
by
the

this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
main
problems
any
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abused
by
the
goverment
either
some
of
you
are
a
little
paranoid
no
offence
mr
parsli
i
have
to
take
exception
at
this
there
are
verifiable
previous
examples
of
levels
of
us
governments
abusing
guncontrol
restrictions
i
dont
think
it
is
paranoid
to
worry
that
what
has
been
abused
in
the
recent
past
might
be
abused
in
thye
future
after
so
many
times
of
getting
burned
any
sane
person
will
stop
putting
his
hand
on
the
stove
or
you
should
get
a
new
goverment
you
do
have
elections
id
love
to
but
as
long
as
the
politicians
grab
power
to
sell
pork
back
to
their
constituents
theres
not
a
lot
i
can
do
its
silly
to
suggest
that
if
theres
anything
we
cant
trust
the
government
to
do
and
therefore
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
do
it
then
we
should
change
governments
down
that
road
lies
total
government
power
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
totalitarianism
guns
n
criminals
most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
this
is
very
likely
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
the
north
american
continent
is
not
europe
no
matter
how
many
people
would
like
it
to
be
drugs
are
very
illegal
and
theyre
here
for
years
canada
has
crowed
about
its
gun
control
if
it
is
necessary
to
control
guns
over
the
whole
continent
then
canada
should
have
always
had
comparable
rates
to
the
us
yet
they
still
dont
unless
you
can
tell
me
why
the
canadian
border
is
so
much
more
magical
than
the
mexican
border
which
is
shorter
and
far
more
heavily
patrolled
then
i
really
cant
accept
that
argument
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
no
there
are
approximately
deaths
due
to
guns
in
the
us
twothirds
of
which
are
suicides
unfortunately
i
dont
have
suicide
rates
for
norway
however
this
makes
the
pergun
death
rate
about
half
the
percar
death
rate
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
the
problems
been
humans
since
before
we
had
stone
axes
the
fct
of
the
matter
is
simply
this
if
nobody
ever
assaulted
anybody
whether
there
is
a
weapon
of
any
sort
around
would
be
totally
irrelevent
yet
weapons
are
built
id
suggest
then
that
the
murderous
impulse
in
humanity
predates
weapons
anyway
the
bosnians
et
al
have
been
making
an
excellent
attempt
to
kill
each
other
for
half
a
thousand
years
taking
away
their
guns
even
if
we
could
would
neither
halt
the
killing
nor
reduce
the
brutality
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
in
the
us
approximately
of
murders
are
commited
with
firearms
with
handguns
with
nonhandguns
the
reason
i
say
that
guns
per
se
are
not
the
problem
is
that
our
nongun
rate
exceeds
most
of
europes
countries
entire
violent
crime
rate
i
dont
really
think
weve
got
more
knives
or
fists
in
any
case
i
think
examples
of
gun
control
applied
to
the
us
have
been
abkect
failures
just
like
drug
prohibition
and
other
forms
of
prohibition
until
you
deal
with
why
people
are
doing
what
they
are
doing
you
wont
solve
your
problem
and
if
the
problem
is
violent
crime
you
shouldnt
concentrate
on
the
tools
instead
the
vast
majority
of
guns
is
never
ever
misused
on
the
order
of
over
the
entire
lifetime
of
the
gun
this
says
to
me
that
you
cant
make
the
argument
that
the
gun
itself
causes
the
misuse
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
the
situation
is
not
good
in
that
people
fear
for
their
lives
but
recall
the
scenes
of
the
storeowners
during
the
last
riots
protecting
their
shops
with
guns
would
it
have
been
better
they
too
lost
their
livelihoods
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
the
problem
of
poverty
and
rage
in
los
angeles
no
it
isnt
however
if
that
problem
becomes
a
violent
action
then
yes
it
can
be
appropriate
whether
or
not
some
person
has
been
hurt
by
their
condition
wont
make
me
less
dead
if
they
burn
down
my
house
with
me
in
it
you
have
to
examine
which
problem
youre
referring
to
if
youre
discussing
someone
violently
assaulting
you
then
it
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
response
to
make
them
stop
hopefully
simply
letting
them
know
youre
prepared
to
shoot
them
would
be
enough
as
it
was
with
the
abovementioned
storeowners
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
of
households
have
some
form
of
firearm
usually
a
long
gun
that
accounts
for
a
level
of
access
for
at
least
million
americans
firearm
ownership
is
most
likely
among
educated
welloff
whites
the
group
least
likely

however
this
decision
might
not

clearcut

snipers
too
often
turn
out

from

copsguardarmy
gunfire
i
dont
know
about
the
other
people
in
this
group
or
on
the
net
but
the
idea
of
tanks
being
used
to
control
civilians
in
anything
that
pretends
to
be
a
free
society
is
outrageous
when
big
government
feels
it
is
necessary
to
use
that
kind
of
force
to
stomp
out
protests
even
violent
of
the
citizens
that
suggests
that
the
government
is
totally
out
of
control
since
that
is
effectively
the
government
declaring
war
on
its
own
people
if
the
government
was
living
up
to
its
responsibility
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
not
the
lords
and
other
elites
who
want
to
keep
their
good
thing
going
the
citizens
wouldnt
feel
the
need
to
be
resorting
to
acts
that
need
to
be
squashed
with
a
military
boot
people
do
things
like
that
because
they
have
become
convinced
that
it
is
the
only
option
that
remains
other
attempts
to
have
grievances
redressed
have
been
ignored
and
yes
there
is
a
criminal
element
that
will
exploit
this
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
government
has
been
unresponsive
or
such
acts
wouldnt
be
apt
to
happen
still
not
an
excuse
to
open
up
on
civilians
with
tanks
heavy
machine
guns
or
whatever
its
the
old
might
makes
right
philosophy
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
government
going
rogue
they
dont
like
it
tough
we
will
simply
squash
them
under
an
iron
boot
actually
addressing
their
grievances
in
other
than
token
fashion
with
huge
volumes
of
hot
air
is
just
too
inconvenient
sort
of
a
variation
on
mushroom
management
keep
them
in
the
dark
smother
them
with
shit
and
crush
them
when
ready
and
these
are
the
folks
that
many
liberals
are
trying
to
arrange
things
so
that
they
will
have
a
monopoly
on
coercive
force
firearms
that
are
than
expensive
toys
by
gutting
the
bill
of
rights
cuz
it
just
isnt
progressive
or
doesnt
fit
in
with
modern
thinking
anymore
unbelievable
and
i
do
believe
amid
the
smoke
confusion
etc
of
a
real
riot
situation
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
tank
to
get
away
with
firing
the
main
gun
into
a
building
at
close
range
one
would
hear
an
explosion
among
many
explosions
it
is
loud
but
it
is
not
going
to
stand
out
like
a
pound
bomb
or
a
tactical
nuke
there
would
be
a
hole
blown
in
the
wall
and
some
rubble
but
with
tanks
knocking
over
walls
and
other
sources
of
buildings
turning
into
rubble
and
other
covering
racket
such
as
gunfire
including
tacking
away
it
would
not
stand
out
that
much
and
could
be
explained
by
musta
been
a
gas
leak
i
think
it
could
be
done
and
not
be
reported
under
such
conditions
it
is
possible
it
is
not
like
a
tank
driving
down
a
quiet
street
on
a
sunday
afternoon
turning
and
firing
you
know
that
would
stand
out

be
pretty

what

is
ridiculous
once
again
i
have
over

the
general

of

of
the

of

canada
per

spend

where
the

what
exactly
do
you

when
you
say
the

spends
more
per

on

than
canada
does
are
you
talking
about
the

or
are
you
talking
about
the
purchase
of
guns
by
private
citizens
or
both
if
you
are
referring
to
private
citizens
then
your
point
is
irrevelant
because
what
individuals
do
with
their

is
essentially
their
business
if
on
the
other
hand
you
meant
that
the
us

spends

per

does
then
your
point
is
relevant
so
if
this
is
true
then
the
us
needs
to
get
its
priorities
straight
people
are
more
important
than
guns
that
is
not
to
say
that
guns
arent
important
im
just
saying
that
if
the
us
government
does
spend
more
per

on
guns
than
they
do
on
people
then
something
is
awry
he
meant
the
us
spends
more
per
capita
on
guns
than
canada
which
isnt
really
surprising
because
we
were
so
busy
protecting
the
western
world
from
the
ussr
that
all
other
countries
could
slack
off
on
their

i
would
like
to
see
if

update
day
friday

was
the
fourth
day
of
the
trial
synopsis
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
crossexamined
agent
cooper
under
repeated
objections
from
prosecutor
ronald
howen
spence
moved
for
a
mistrial
but
was
denied
the
day
was
marked
by
a
caustic
crossexamination
of
deputy
marshal
larry
cooper
by
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
although
spence
has
not
explicitly
stated
so
one
angle
of
his
stategy
must
involve
destroying
the
credibility
of
agent
cooper
cooper
is
the
governments
only
eyewitness
to
the
death
of
agent
degan
spence
attacked
coopers
credibility
by
pointing
out
discrepancies
between
coopers
statements
last
september
and
those
made
in
court
cooper
conceded
that
you
have
all
these
things
compressed
into
a
few
secondsits
difficult
to
remember
what
went
on
first
cooper
acknowledged
that
he
carried
a
colt
commando
submachine
gun
with
a
silenced
barrel
i
thought
a
colt
commando
was
a
revolver
cooper
continued
by
stating
that
the
federal
agents
had
no
specific
plans
to
use
the
weapon
when
they
started
to
kill
weavers
dog
when
spence
asked
how
seven
cartridges
could
be
fired
by
degans
rifle
when
degan
was
apparently
dead
cooper
could
not
say
for
sure
that
degan
did
not
return
fire
before
going
down
spence
continued
by
asking
with
how
many
agents
and
to
what
extent
had
cooper
discussed
last
augusts
events
cooper
responded
if
youre
implying
that
we
got
our
story
together
youre
wrong
counselor
spence
continued
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
namely
that
a
marshal
had
started
the
shooting
by
killing
the
weavers
dog
cooper
disagreed
assistant
us
attorney
ronald
howen
repeatedly
objected
to
spences
virulent
crossexamination
of
agent
cooper
arguing
that
the
questions
were
repetitive
and
spence
was
wasting
time
howen
also
complained
that
spence
was
improperly
using
a
crossexamination
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
us
district
judge
edward
lodge
sustained
many
of
the
objections
however
both
lawyers
persisted
until
judge
lodge
had
the
jury
leave
the
room
and
proceded
to
admonish
both
attorneys
im
not
going
to
play
games
with
either
counsel
this
has
been
a
personality
problem
from
day
so
start
acting
like
professionals
spence
told
the
judge
that
when
all
the
evidence
is
in
well
see
that
his
agent
larry
cooper
testimony
is
not
credible
that
he
was
panicked
and
cannot
remember
the
sequence
of
events
spence
continued
were
going
to
findthat
there
is
a
very
unlikely
similarity
almost
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
cookie
cutter
between
the
testimony
of
mr
cooper
and
the
other
witnesses
spence
then
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
the
grounds
that
howens
repeated
objections
would
prevent
a
fair
trial
we
cant
have
a
fair
trial
if
the
jury
believes
im
some
sort
of
charlatan
if
the
jury
believes
im
bending
the
rules
or
engaging
in
some
delaying
tactic
or
that
im
violating
court
orders
judge
lodge
called
the
notion
that
his
repeated
sustainings
of
howens
objections
had
somehow
prejudiced
the
jury
was
preposterous
and
denied
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
lodge
did
tell
howen
to
restrict
his
comments
when
objecting
the
trial
resumed
with
the
prosecution
calling
fbi
special
agent
greg
rampton
the
prosecutions
purpose
was
simply
to
introduce
five
weapons
found
in
the
cabin
as
evidence
however
the
defense
seized
on
the
opportunity
to
further
address
coopers
credibility
defense
attorney
ellison
matthews
harris
other
attorney
questioned
rampton
about
the
dog
rampton
stated
that
there
were
no
specific
plans
to
kill
the
weavers
dog
without
being
detected
matthews
then
had
rampton
read
a
septtember
transcript
in
which
rampton
had
said
that
cooper
had
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
silenced
weapon
was
to
kill
the
dog
without
being
detected
if
the
dog
chased
them
rampton
then
acknowledged
that
he
believed
that
cooper
had
said
that
but
he
could
not
remember
when
he
then
stated
that
i
did
not
conduct
the
primary
interview
with
deputy
cooper
but
i
have
had
conversations
with
him
since
the
interview
was
conducted
monday

randy
weaver
trial
update
day
here
is
a
copy
of
my
first
update
on
the
randy
weaver
trial
after
a
large
response
about
email
messages
ive
decided
that
there
is
sufficient
interest
here
on
tpg
to
warrant
posting
file
follows
hi
folks
as
perhaps
the
only
boise
resident
on
the
list
i
guess
it
kind
of
falls
on
me
to
keep
people
updated
about
the
randy
weaverkevin
harris
trial
yesterday
marked
the
seating
of
the
jury
apparently
no
other
legal
activities
occurred
the
jury
was
selected
and
things
start
today
more
interesting
is
what
happenned
outside
about
a
dozen
weaver
supporters
showed
up
to
stage
a
protest
outside
the
courthouse
one
woman
carried
a
sign
that
read
who
stands
trial
for
the
murder
of
vicki
and
sons
name
i
forget
weaver
on
the
evening
news
she
said
i
am
here
protesting
because
i
believe
in
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion
i
thought
we
all
did
nice
sound
bite
grin
the
news
reporter
also
interviewed
some
guy
named
tim
who
refused
to
give
his
last
name
not
to
prejudge
the
guy
but
he
looked
like
a
neonazi
he
also
said
he
expected
many
neonazis
to
show
up
throughout
the
trial
tim
had
been
handing
out
leaflets
in
support
of
weaver
and
harris
and
the
news
had
footage
of
a
boise
cop
telling
him
to
move
along
or
hed
arrest
i
dont
know
the
finer
points
of
this
one
perhaps
theres
a
law
against
political
activity
within
x
feet
of
a
courthouse
or
something
what
happenned
to
the
first
amendment
most
ominous
of
all
was
that
the
local
reporter
filmed
an
agent
of
the
gestapoerratf
with
a
minicam
filming
the
protestors
welcome
to
the
world
of
big
brother
anyhow
gerry
spence
came
out
and
asked
the
protestors
to
leave
because
he
didnt
think
it
would
help
weavers
case
any
he
said
he
was
confident
that
once
the
evidence
came
out
that
weaver
would
be
aquitted
more

as
it
comes
available

brady
bill
loopholes
hi
ive
just
finished
reading
and
have
several
questions
about
the
brady
bills
and
are
these
the
current
versions
of
the
brady
bill
what
is
the
status
of
these
bills
ive
heard
theyre
in
committee
how
close
is
that
to
being
made
law
and
seem
fairly
similar
are
there
any
important
differences
i
missed
seems
to
have
some
serious
loopholes
a
doesnt
specify
an
appeals
process
to
wrongful
denial
during
the
waiting
period
other
than
a
civil
lawsuit
has
an
appeals
process
once
the
required
instant
background
check
system
is
established
but
not
before
b
the
police
are
explicitly
not
liable
for
mistakes
in
denyingapproving
using
existing
records
so
who
would
i
sue
in
a
above
to
have
an
inaccurate
record
corrected
c
includes
an
exceptiontowaitingperiod
clause
for
if
a
person
can
convince
the
local
chief
lawenforcement
officer
cleo
of
an
immediate
threat
to
his
or
her
life
or
life
of
a
household
member
but
doesnt
say
exactly
what
is
considered
a
threat
nor
does
it
place
a
limit
on
how
long
the
cleo
takes
to
issue
an
exception
statement
true
have
i
misunderstood
any
other
holes
with
just
whats
to
stop
a
person
with
a
clean
record
from
buying
guns
grinding
off
the
serial
numbers
and
selling
them
to
crooks
at
minimum
what
additional
laws
are
needed
to
prevent
this
seems
at
min
a
gun
counting
scheme
would
be
needed
eg
john
doe
owns
n
guns
so
if
passes
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
legislation
for
stricter
hardertoforge
ids
plus
national
gun
registration
justified
by
a
need
to
make
the
brady
bill
work
please
comment
im
mainly
interested
in
specific
problems
with
the
current
legislationi
dont

this
might

just
the

we
need

out
in

also
people
would
have
a
need
to
replace
guns
with
something
else
perhaps
deadly
sprays
that
would
make
mace
and
oc
seem

water
they
would
be
lighter
and
easier
to
conceal
guns
are
really
old
in
design
and
as
long
as
we
have
tons
of
them
no
one
is
motivated
to
design
something
better
im
sure
we
could
come
up
with
some
real
nasty
stuff
if
we
tried
and
getting
rid
of
these
guns
would
get
us
moving
on

track
asap
this
is
what
we
really
want
right
stuff
thats
smaller
lighter
and
far
more
deadly
remember
in

well
really
scramble

the

it

was
just
a

it
looked
to
me
like
they
were
practicing
to
shoot
someone
the
point
that
i
forgot
to
bring
up
here
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
being

or
not
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
concealed

in
this

in

for
that
matter
this
is
not
to
say
that
people
in

dont
carry
concealed

illegaly
but
practicing
like
that
when
there
are
other
people
around
wasnt
too
bright
of
an
idea
there
isnt
necessarily
a
conflict
between
practicing
with
a

for
selfdefence
and
practicing
to
shoot
someone
armed
selfdefence
does
occasionally
involve

i
agree
if

you

a

your

is
to

that
my

was

we

and
showed
it
to
our

when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in

ah
canada
where
the
criminals
dont

with
checking
to

are

they
just
break
on
in
americas
a
little
different
you
see
criminals
worry
a
bit
more
about
getting
shot
so
they
more
frequently
check
to
see
if
anyones
home
i
knew
somebody
else
who
went

of
your

superstore
places
just
so
he

the

recently
referred

the

automatic

very
appropriately
it
was

ah

again
isnt

tell

mr

didnt
britain
come
begging

us
gun

in

seems

though
your

had
disarmed
you
aw
chaps
you
can
jolly
give
up
your
guns
if
that
hitler
man
starts

we
can
always
hit
up
the
yanks
for
a

theyve
got
a
bloody
eccentric

about
those

you
know
just
hand

keith
thanks
i
talked

the
federal
dept
of
justice
doj
ottawa
to
try
and
clarify
a
bunch
of
things
regarding
changes
to
canadian
gun
laws
i
am
posting
here
for
informational
purposes
questions
to
email
followup
to
tpg
it
is
still
technically
feasible
but
almost
impossible
to
get
a
concealed
carry
permit
in
canada
this
is
contrary
to
what
i
was
told
by
a
police
officer
it
is
still
legal
to
use
lethal
force
such
as
a
firearm
to
protect
life
also
contrary
to
what
the
officer
told
me
guns
must
be
stored
locked
up
and
unloaded
however
regarding
hicapacity
magazines
it
is
still
not
clear
who
will
be
exempt
or
how
this
will
be
managed
this
is
up
to
each
province
the
general
idea
is
that
exempt
persons
will
receive
a
letterform
authorizing
them
to
possess
the
high
capacity
magazines
apparently
the
authorization
is
to
specify
how
many
of
these
prohibited
weapons
you
will
be
allowed
to
possess
dealers
will
be
allowed
to
order
high
capacity
mags
for
those
allowed
to
possess
them
but
will
not
be
allowed
to
stock
them
high
capacity
magazines
converted
to
comply
with
the
new
limits
will
not
be
considered
prohibited
weapons
amendments
to
the
regulations
specify
some
possible
methods
to
alter
the
magazines
some
manufacturers
beretta
will
be
marketing
reduced
capacity
magazines
god
knows
how
much
theyll
charge
for
these
this

most
of

as

about
the
ohio
prison
riot
where
they
have
killed
at
least
one
of
the
hostage
guards
i
know
its
not
the
same
group
but
the
mindset
appears
to
be
common
to
those
what
rule
here
latelythey
wont
give
diddley
to
the
bds
in
waco
but
they
treat
criminals
as
deserving
of
humanitarian
gestures
this
is
but
another
indicator
that
the
criminal
caste
seems
to
enjoy
more
priviliges
in
todays
society
than
their
victims
or
other
law
abiding
citizens
what
is
it
that
makes
the
criminal
so
precious
to
the
leaders
of
the
system
could
it
be
that
the
criminal
is
one
of
the
tools
the
authorities
are
using
to
excuse
some
of
the
rights
negation
they
are
trying
to
foist
upon
the
law

citizen
in
the
name
of
crime
controldont
solve
the

problem
because
then
the

couldnt
be

hostage
to
our
help
if
the
crime
problem
were
solved
in
favor
of
the
citizenvictim
at
the
expense
of
the

none
of
the
crap
such
as
rico

could
be

firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
so
why
did
the
australian
customs
service
make
a
public
statement
to
a
parliamentary
committee
last
year
that
weapons
smuggling
was
a
problem
which
it
was
not
able
to
control
possibly
criminals
dont
have
your
grasp

here
we

that

fool

yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
and
i
suppose
i
should
just
take
your
word
for
it
did
you
ever
think
that
many
people
who
use
firearms
to
protect
themselves
might
not
admit
to
it
because
of
the
ridiculous
laws
which
exist
forbidding
concealed
carry
the
bulk
of
firarems
are
used
against
unworthy
and
unnesessary
opponents
those
who
posessa
a
cool
jakcet
you
want
those
who
would
argue
with
you
about
a
parking
space
those
who
would
take
your
woman
in
short
trivial
and
worthless
causes
i
already
own
a
cool
jacket
i
ride
a
bicycle
to
work
and
park
it
behind
my
desk
and
if
my
woman
decides
to
go
with
someone
else
id
be
disappointed
but
killing
her
new
suitor
will
probably
not
endear
her
to
me
any
more
than
before
frankly
ive
never
met
a
woman
worth
killing
for
anyway
now
an
with
a
chrome
barrel
thats
worth
killing
for
too
much
of
this
has
ruined
you
cause
there
is
no
recovery
in
the
near
future
federal
martials
will
come
for
your
arms
no
one
will
help
you
you
are
more
dangerous
to
their
thinking
than
the
criminal
this
is
your
own
fault
does
this
pinhead
know
something
the
rest
of
us
dont
im
not
too
worried
about
federal
martials
coming
to
get
my
guns
the
government
cant
seem
to
keep
violent
criminals
in
jail
since
they
dont
have
enough
prison
space
and
the
legal
system
is
over
burdened
anyway
where
are
they
going
to
put
all
the
millions
of
gunowners
who
wont
fork
over
their
weapons
maybe
youd
like
to
volunteer
the
services
of
your
humble
abode
since
you
obviously
feel
sooooo
strongly
about

the

your

no

how

public

we
must
be
reading
different
public
opinion
polls
i
agree
that
the
misguided
public
would
like
to
see
assault
weapons
banned
mainly
because
they
are
being
lied
to
by
the
media
about
the
frequency
of
their
use
in
violent
crime
but
if
public
opinion
were
so
deadset
against

you
can
bet
that
idiots
like
metzenbaum
and
schumer
would
be
seeing
their
foolish

getting
passed
through

a
lot
easier
than
they
are
and
as
governments
go
broke
and
can
no
longer
protect

you
can
bet
that
the
american
people
will
start
to
really
appreciate
the
usefulness
of
firearms
contrary
to
what
you
might
think
time

probably
on

side
not

this
is

my

this

nothing

ridiculous
tripe

the

the

public
is

the

is

this
is
it
yeah
the
liberal
press
doesnt
like
us
much
but
you
cant
really
expect
coherent
thought
from
them
anyway
their
opinions
are
based
more
on
a
desire
to
appear
politically
correct
than
on
facts
which
are
generously
provided
by
the
fbi
if
theyd
bother
to
put
on
their
birkenstocks
and
go
to
the
library
to
read
them
most
of
my
friends
are
antigun
and
without
exception
none
of
them
bases
hisher
opinions
on
facts
they
would
rather
believe
despite
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
disarming
lawabiding
citizens
would
make
the
world
more
civilized
when
all
it
really
does
is
make
us
all
sheep
they
would
rather
wallow
in
their
pitiful
liberal
white
guilt
about
how
society
has
driven
the
criminal
to
rob
rape
and
murder
they
support
spending
millions
of
public
dollars
protecting
the
rights
of
scum
who
have
already
demonstrated
that
they
have
no
regard
for
society
or
its
laws
they
ignore
the
fact
that
areas
with
the
strictest
gun
control
nycdc
have
the
worst
crime
and
areas
with
little
gun
control
vtnhid
have
very
little
crime
in
comparison
but
they
have
to
ignore
this
because
otherwise
they
would
need
to
confront
the
fact
that
lawabiding
citizens
who
own
guns
are
not
the
ones
that
are
causing
most
of
the
trouble
in
society
oh
no
we
certainly
cant
accept
that
but
i
guess
i
have
faith
that
when
crime
starts
making
significant
inroads
into
their
neighborhoods
and
starts
directly
hurting
them
and
their
families
they
will
probably
whistle
a
different
tune
they
just
better
hope
it
isnt
too
late
then
surrender
your
arms
soon
enough
officers
will
be
around
to
collect
them
resistance
is
useless
they
will
overwhelm
you
one
at
a
time
hmmm
i
wasnt
expecting
company
tonight
i
might
be
able
to
whip
up
a
quick
cheese
and
cracker
plate
but
they
should
probably
bring
their
own
drinks
do
i
have
time
to
vacuum
the
rug
too
fucking
bad
you
have
gone
the
way
of
the
kkk
violent
solutions
are

avoid

you

by

yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
excerpted
from
a
letter
i
wrote
a
while
ago
although
less
apparent
to
those
who
have
not
researched
the
facts
personal
protection
is
as
legitimate
a
reason
as
sport
for
the
private
citizen
to
own
a
gun
the
most
recent
research
is
that
of
dr
gary
kleck
of
the
florida
state
university
school
of
he
found
that
handguns
are
more
often
used
by
victims
to
defeat
crime
than
by
criminals
to
commit
it
vs
respectively
in
this
study
these
figures
are
even
more
encouraging
when
you
consider
the
number
of
crimes
that
never
occur
because
of
the
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
hands
of
a
lawabiding
private
citizen
in
a
national
institute
of
justice
study
of
ten
state
prisons
across
the
country
they
found
that
of
the
felons
surveyed
had
aborted
at
least
one
crime
because
they
believed
that
the
intended
victim
was
armed
and
agreed
that
most
criminals
are
more
worried
about
meeting
an
armed
victim
than
they
are
about
running
into
the
one
of
the
most
heinous
of
crimes
is
that
against
the
women
of
this
country
it
has
been
my
recent
observation
that
more
women
are
purchasing
handguns
for
defense
in
response
to
the
present
danger
of
these
assaults
this
should
be
taken
as
encouraging
news
if
the
events
of
orlando
florida
are
any
indicator
in
the
late
the
female
populace
was
plagued
with
a
series
of
brutal
assaults
just
the
publicity
of
the
record
number
of
women
buying
guns
and
obtaining
training
resulted
in
an
decrease
in
rape
for
that
area
the
only
city
of
its
size
in
the
country
to
experience
a
decrease
of
crime
for
that
year

theres

cocking

turns

that
a

cylinder
is

in

it

other

dont

combined
the

include

that
if
davis

in

a

number

her

she
doesnt

civilians
should
have
the

sigh
well
if
police
think
they
are
so
special
that
only
they
are
worthy
of
selfdefense
perhaps
we
start
putting
the
arm
on
police
maybe
we
should
start
demanding
that
police
are
only
police
when
onduty
that
after
that
they
are
just
like
the
ordinary
disarmed
helpless
chumps
they
consider
civilians
lets
prohibit
arms
carrying
by
police
when
offduty
or
if
they
make
the
assertion
that
well
i
need
to
maintain
my
gun
lets
make
it
regulation
that
they
can
carry
an
unloaded
firearm
home
that
its
only
fair
that
they
be
just
as

it
is
fairly

with

finding
that
approximately
of
households
have
at

one
firearm
ok
a
nearmajority
actually
own

but
i
will
still
claim
that
the
vast

never
needs
to
use

or
even
threaten
anyone

incidents
a
year
doesnt
count
with
you
what
do
they
do
right
or
are
they
just
lucky
maybe
theyre
just
unlucky
if
a
rapist
pulls
a
woman
into
an
alley
in
boston
chances
are
almost
certain
that
she
wont
be
counted
as
one
of
those
selfdefenders
because
our
local
constabulary
didnt
consider
it
important
that
she
be
allowed
to
arm
herself
even
though
the
shotgun
she
owns
at
home
makes
her
show
up
in
the
gun
owner
column
in
either
case
this
means
the
average
threat
level
in
this
country
is
rather
low
ironic
words
for
somebody
who
lives
in
florida
the
average
threat
level
in
florida
has
been
reduced
by
a
liberal
ccw
policy
its
well
known
that
your
local
thugs
like
to
target
tourists
precisely
because
they
are
less
likely
to
be
carrying
than
your
natives
come
on
up
to
boston
or
nyc
or
washington
dc
and
see
how
much
diddlysquat
the
average
threat
level
in
the
country
means
to
a
resident
there
i
think
you
have
weapons
on
the
brain
i
never
said
that
these
alternative
means
of
selfprotection
involved
any
hardware
why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr
jones
house
sometimes
this
works
sometimes
it
just
lands
your
good
neighbors
on
the
dance
card
for
the
next
wave
of
drivebys
someone
here
once
told
a
story
about
la
gangs
moving
into
phoenix
ive
misplaced
the
original
text
but
the
story
started
with
one
resident
calling
the
cops
on
a
gang
member
sure
enough
a
few
nights
later
there
was
a
driveby
performed
at
the
residents
house
except
that
this
time
unlike
in
la
the
entire
street
came
out
and
returned
fire
putting
an
end
to
the
cars
occupants
the
gang
packed
up
and
left
of
course
in
la
or
in
a
place
like
florida
after
the
hurricane
your
first
problem
is
to
find
an
officer
to
step
up
to
and
tell
anything
in
short
the
alternative
to
firepower
is
gangs
or
at
least
a
benificent
manifestation
of
that
social
cooperative
replace
lead
with
flesh
the
flesh
makes
a
better
conversationalist
too
and
you
can
invite
it
over
for
a
block
party
look
nobody
is
arguing
this
i
have
a
fire
extinguisher
at
home
that
doesnt
mean
i
can
be
careless
about
tossing
my
burnt
matches
on
the
carpet
i
live
carefully
monitor
the
woodstove
get
my
flue
cleaned
twice
a
year
and
test
my
smoke
alarms
annually
but
if
despite
all
this
a
fire
does
start
its
too
late
for
any
of
these
things
except
the
extinguisher
but
legality
and
legitimacy
also
matter
if
a
governments
charter
makes
a
rule
which
the
government
then
violates
it
is
violated
the
basis
for
its
existance
enforcement
of
its
will
becomes
a
matter
solely
of
force
of
arms
oliver
north
the
man
is
positively
worshiped
in

allamerican
conservative

he

big

long
as

our

who

you
seem

you

whitecollar

ultimately
no

i
claimed

no

some
of
us
like
to

that

are

the

was
founded
in
what
in
the
they
ran
a
one
million
strong
campaign
for
two
years
before
reaching
this
goal
my
understanding
is
that
they
reached
it
by
the
stratagem
of
including
wide
classes
of
people
other
than
duespaying
members
i
cant
speak
authoritatively
on
this
maybe
somebody
else
has
details
then
they
started
running
a
two
million
strong
campaign
for
a
while
but
they
let
it
slip
into
unannounced
obscurity
when
it
became
clear
that
they
simply
were
never
going
to
reach
that
level
of
membership
in
just
after
the
commencement
of
the
dodd
hearings
the
starting
point
of
the
modern
guncontrol
movement
the
nra
had
a
mere
members
by
barely
after
the
first
murmurs
of
future
registration
it
had
about
a
million
today
it
has
over
three
million
members
making
it
the
third
largest
membership
organization
in
the
country
next
to
aarp
and
aaa
and
its
membership
is
growing
faster
than
at
any
previous
time
historical
figures
from
kuklas
gun
control
pp
and
as
you
say
many
of
the
people
in
the
middle
of
this
debate
are
bemused
by
their
tbones
and
mtv
that
leaves
hardcore

against
hardcore

i
know
a

who
have
recently

ive
never
heard
of

single
one
who
has
gone
the

i
think
we
can

win
this

firearmsrelated
mindless

will
be
related
to
the
availibility
of
firearms
if
they
become
scarce
and
and
expensive
a
different
psychology
will
take
hold
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
settle
trivial
complaints
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
hammer
nails
as
well
but
like
you
i
cant
give
any

showing
that
this

is

btw
which
parts
should
be
secure
criminal
records
ie
convictions
are
typically
considered
public
information
so
should
that
info
be
secure
remember
the
population
includes
parents
checking
prospective
childcare
worker
like
i
said
im
not
sure
of
the
details
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
access
medical
information
without
giving
out
a
name
or
any
other
information
medical
info
without
a
namebody
attached
is
completely
useless
for
treatment
the
article
i
mentioned
the
the
earlier
post
described
a
debit
card
type
transaction
in
which
neither
the
store
nor
the
bank
knew
who
was
withdrawing
the
money
thus
making
it
as
secure
as
cash
for
some
purposes
but
far
less
secure
for
others
parents
checking
a
babysitter
shouldnt
need
access
to
the
information
stored
in
the
card
sure
they
do
the
prospective
sitter
may
have
a
nasty
habit
of
molesting
kids
three
or
four
months
into
the
job
the
references
may
not
have
known
him
long
enough
or
may
not
have
picked
up
on
this
yet
remember
criminal
conviction
info
is
public
so
if
youre
going
to
argue
for
an
id
card
other
people
are
going
to
have
a
strong
argument
that
it
disclose
public
info
things
i
think
anything
that
you
choose
to
keep
unknown
should
be
thus
making
it
useless
for
negative
information
could
have
it
so
that
only
doctors
can
access
medical
information
police
criminal
records
etc
etc
yeah
right
how
are
you
going
to
keep
doctors
from
spilling
the
beans
we
already
know
that
you
cant
keep
cops
from
disclosing
info
but
at
least
that
info
is
typically
supposed
to
be
public
anyway
like
i
said
its
best
if
you
read
the
article
for
yourself
the
article
discusses

not

it

as

you
can
be

better
armed
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
every
city
and
suburban
police
officer
ive
seen
around
the
twin
cities
in
the
last
two
years
has
carried
a
semiauto
of
some
type
different
brands
though
i
havent
seen
any
glocks
with
regard
to
this
discussion
we
are
getting
dangerously
far
from
the
usual
rantings
of
tpg
and
close
to
the
realm
of
rg
but
id
like
to
put
my
two
cents
worth
in
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
a
revolver
especially
a
large
frame
sw
in
magnum
my
favorite
there
are
valid
advantages
to
semiautos
i
suggest
reading
massad
ayoobs
i
know
some
people
cant
stand
him
and
think
hes
full
of
bull
but
i
think
that
in
general
his
material
is
very
valid
and
useful
book
the
semi
auto
pistol
in
police
work
or
something
like
that
he
defines
a
number
of
ways
that
semiautos
are
different
and
that
different
is
good
the
main
advantage
is
not
in
increased
firepower
but
in
more
accurate
followup
shots
when
you
go
to
single
action
mode
there
is
also
a
certain
propriatory
nature
of
each
gun
that
takes
some
familiarity
to
learn
this
may
have
diminished
with
time
as
more
criminals
become
familiar
with
different
models
of
semiautos
but
it
was
cited
as
stopping
or
at
least
slowing
down
criminals
who
had
grabbed
a
police
officers
gun
define
armed
better
go
shoot
a
revolver
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
does
one
fires
faster
than
the
other
nope
aside
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usually
not
desirable
sure
it
makes
the
other
guys
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
trying
hitting
anything
with
a
thompson
in
hosemode
this
is
why
the
military
is
limiting
its
now
to
burstfire
simple
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troops
like
to
be
able
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wasteful
of
ammo
something
often
in
short
supply
when
the
enemy
is
plentiful
a
revolver
is
equally
capable
as
a
semiauto
in
the
same
caliber
a
revolver
also
has
the
advantage
that
if
it
misfires
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
a
doubleaction
revolver
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcocked
first
but
will
fire
merely
by
pulling
the
trigger
yes
but
this
is
best
done
with
a
two
hand
hold
with
a
single
hand
you
either
pull
the
gun
far
off
target
to
cock
or
must
fire
double
action
the
da
semi
auto
has
the
same
advantages
plus
is
always
sa
after
the
first
shot
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotate
to
the
next
round
im
not
sure
if
this
is
meant
to
be
different
from
your
first
point
in
a
da
semiauto
you
can
pull
the
trigger
again
to
try
dropping
the
hammer
on
the
same
round
an
advantage
you
dont
have
in
a
revolver
where
the
next
trigger
pull
will
always
go
to
the
next
round
discussing
this
point
now
this
is
fine
with
a
dud
but
what
about
a
hangfire
situation
granted
its
very
rare
but
your
round
will
now
go
off
confined
in
the
cylinder
with
no
place
to
go
slingshotting
the
slide
on
a
misfire
takes
very
little
time
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safety
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fired
with
an
easy
motion
even
one
handed
actually
with
modern
revolver
designs
incorporating
hammer
blocks
this
is
not
necessary
or
usually
recommended
a
revolver
would
have
to
fall
hard
enough
and
at
the
right
angle
to
actually
break
the
hammer
and
driver
the
firing
pin
into
the
round
to
set
it
off
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
the
best
speedloader
users
especially
those
using
the
spring
loaded
speed
loaders
are
very
fast
a
problem
is
that
ejecting
the
spent
cases
is
a
two
handed
job
where
dropping
the
expended
magazine
is
one
handed
this
means
that
while
you
can
be
inserting
a
fresh
magazine
as
soon
as
the
old
one
clears
the
gun
with
a
speed
loader
you
have
to
go
through
more
motions
that
will
always
take
more
time
you
also
dont
have
the
advantage
of
tactical
reloads
replacing
a
partial
magazine
to
bring
you
back
to
full
capacity
the
partial
magazine
can
still
be
used
if
needed
later
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
yes
the
time
to
recognize
the
problem
is
just
as
important
as
the
time
to
clear
it
really
though
in
either
a
revolver
or
semiauto
the
odds
of
an
actual
misfire
with
factory
ammo
are
awfully
small
you
are
more
likely
to
get
a
jam
in
a
semiauto
but
even
these
are
exceptionally
rare
with
modern
quality
guns
sigs
glocks
etal
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
all
common
semiautos
can
be
carried
with
a
round
in
their
chamber
without
any
safety
problems
while
i
put
that
out
as
a
statement
that
i
believe
i
should
say
that
this
applies
to
all
of
the
ones
ive
looked
at
for
the
da
semis
its
no
different
from
the
revolver
situation
the
guns
all
have
hammer
or
firing
pin
blocks
they
also
have
a
safety
because
theres
no
real
advantage
carrying
one
of
these
cocked
and
locked
you
have
the
same
safety
and
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
plus
the
advantage
of
sa
followup
shots
im
not
familiar
with
sa
semiautos
except
for
the
i
admit
that
i
was
initially
skeptical
about
carrying
this
cocked
and
locked
but
after
examining
the
design
trying
to
defeat
the
safeties
gun
unloaded
of
course
and
shooting
it
a
lot
i
see
no
inherent
safety
problems
with
it
especially
in
a
thumbreak
holster
with
the
strap
under
the
hammer
this
design
also
gets
you
more
speed
for
an
accurate
first
shot
than
a
revolver
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
yeah
the
infamous
glock
i
still
cant
figure
out
how
its
worse
than
a
revolver
for
safety
if
you
dont
pull
the
trigger
it
doesnt
go
off
i
imagine
that
if
all
your
revolver
shooting
was
done
double
action
then
you
could
pull
the
glock
trigger
far
enough
to
fire
before
you
realized
it
in
addition
if
you
had
developed
that
nasty
habit
of
keeping
your
finger
on
the
trigger
when
holstering
your
gun
and
relying
on
your
thumb
on
the
hammer
to
remind
you
to
take
it
off
before
you
blew
off
your
foot
then
youd
have
problems
when
the
hammer
wasnt
there
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
i
think
this
is
even
okay
for
a
riot
as
long
as
its
a
small
one
b
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
i
have
the
poor
mans
beretta
taurus
and
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
the
springfield
oops
vs
arguments
are
relegated
to
rg
you
are
right
though
if
you
dont
hit
what
you
aim
at
then
the
shootergun
combination
has
failed
i
dont
ascribe
failures
in
the
the
fire
real
fast
with
a
wondernine
scenario
you
mention
to
the

this
is
a
shooter
failure
whether
through
lack
of
discipline
or
lack
of
training
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
are
becoming
more
popular
with
crooks
too
though
the
does
still
lead

introduce
unneccessary

why
you
no

see
the

these

were

for
the

own

they
certainly
have

programs
whether
they
will
check
for

answer

please
note
that
the
given
for
each

in

will
not

money
orders
how
much
total
amnesty
can
you
get
if
you
leave

trail
behind
in
the
latest
case
in
denver
they
were
giving

tickets
to

denver

how
traceable
is
a
money
order
i
dont
know
havent
used
one
in
years
money
orders
operate
pretty
much
like
checks
with
both
parties
being
supposed
to
sign
them
i
assume
youd
have
to
show
the
buyback
people
an
id
and
youd
then
have
a
money
order
made
out
to
that
id
as
far
as
traceable
as
a
practical
matter
i
dont
know
it
would
depend
on
whether
they
bother
to
computerize
who
the
recipients
name
is
on
the
money
order
and
bother
keying
that
sort
of
thing
in
id
say
certainly
the
police
and
the
buyback
people
would
keep
a
record
of
who
they
gave
money
orders
out
to
is
that
even
an
issue
if
the
weapons
arent
checked
for
being
stolen
there
might
be
some
questions
asked
i
suppose
if

brought

if

were

banned
today
it
would
be
much
more

i
love

explain
why
the

do
not
also
rank
a
notch
below

above
the

in

why

semi
past
and
firepower
in
a
similar
vein
the
amount
of
marijuana
smuggled
into
this
country
has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its
valueperpound
is
very
low
when
compared
to
cocaine
or
heroin
its
simply
not
worth
the
risk
its
uneconomical
now
most
reefer
is
domestic
there
is
less
pressure
on
the
domestic
producer
showy
raids
notwithstanding
and
thus
it
is
economical
of
note
though
domestic
reefer
is
now
very
strong
so
a
small
volume
goes
a
long
way
you
cannot
make
alcohol
stronger
than
proof
not
a

whats
the
point
here
youre
arguing

the

works

it
does
of

firearms
tend

fall

would
be
concerned
about
valuecubic
foot
go
to
a
gun
show
and
price
out
a
crate
of
good

it
would
not
be

to
smuggle
them
in

would
have
to
be

he

glocks
have

firearms

to
fall

low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
that
depends
only
on
the
profit
of
doing
so
the
differences
in
cost
of
production
will
determine
local

would
have
to
be
local

how
much
is
through
the
nose
after
all
we
know
quite
a
bit
about
how
much
a
gun
is
worth
to
a
criminal
so
if
that
is
dwarfed
by
the
price
demanded
by
the
bad
part
of
that
the
relevant
economic
analysis
has
been
made
the
profit
of
gun
crime
is
high
enough
that
the
price
required
to
push
criminals
out
of
the
market
is
high
enough
that
everyone
will
be
motivated
that
analysis
ignored
some
improvements
in

could

i

wed

be
for

the
problem
is
the
methods
were
using
now
dont
do
the
trick
dont
manufacture
them
dont
sell
them
dont
import
them
some
guns
will
get
through
but
far
fewer
and
far
less
people
will
die
because
of
them
hunting
weapons
could
be
allowed
of
course
as
long
as
they
are
big
and
bulky
and
require
reloading
after
a
few
shots
how
many
times
can
you
shoot
at
the
same
animal
anyways
one
assumes
they
are
moving
a
better
solution
if
the
bad
people
cant
be
trusted
with
guns
then
lock
them
or
knock
them
off
stop
punishing

a

the

that

the
only
thing
that
i
know
about

is
the
lack

a
real

on

sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in

but
that
isnt
too
great
of

now
we

that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a

is
supposed

do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the

from
going

unless
thats
what
the

wants

one
says
i
want
the

if
the

that

it

what

someone
tell

what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out

proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a

cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
so
look
in
the
trunk
some
time
heck
look
at
the
dash
that
funny
thing
attached
with
a
quickrelease
is
a
gun
the
ones
in
the
trunk
are
better
i
dont
have
numbers
for
chicago
but
philadelphia
police
cars
carried
multiple
automatic
weapons
and
thousands
of
rounds
as
standard
issue
in
the
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
what
is
the
nature
of
this
disadvantage
if
the
cop
can
shoot
rounds
will
do
the
job
against
a
single
opponent
especially
since
the
cop
has
guaranteed
backup
if
the
gang
member
can
shoot
the
extra
rounds
dont
help
the
only
time
this
difference
can
matter
is
if
neither
can
shoot
and
cops
arent
supposed
to
be
throwing
lead
around
like
that
btw
most
cops
carry
multiple
guns
youre
not
supposed
to
know
about
the
second
third
and
so
on
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
then
the
extra
rounds
wont
make
any
difference
so
why
is
it
an
issue

basically
the

i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a

harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of

thats
just
my
opinion

you

a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
if

i
would
have
to
get

gunlicence
from
the

and
to
be

the

would
check
my

records

any
serious

records

crimes
are

that
have

these
are
rather
the

only

of
tanks
using
their
main
guns
to
respond
to
sniper
fire
quite
effectively
i
wasnt
wrong
ive
heard
those
descriptions
if
youre
paying
attention
ive
mentioned
that
i
saw
the
tanks
with
my
own
eyes
but
the
main
gun
firing
was
an
account
i
heard
that
helps
people
judge
whether
or
not
to
kick
in
the
to
use
your
words
bullshit
filters
stating
that
i
claimed
this
is
a
falsehood
what
was
it
i
claimed
as
fact
heres
the
entire
post
we
havent
used
tanks
against
the
black
ghettos
since
detroit
correction
i
know
they
used
tanks
in
detroit
i
saw
em
it
was
well
covered
in
the
news
at
that
time
gordon
lightfoot
mentions
it
in
his
song
black
day
in
july
since
you
dont
dispute
that
and
claim
that
nobody
else
does
that
means
i
was
right
i
will
never
read
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
in
detroit
in
the
riots
there
is
simply
no
way
that
such
an
event
could
have
taken
place
without
it
being
common
knowledge
even
years
later
the
american
military
firing
shells
from
tanks
in
american
cities
on
blacks
would
have
been
big
news
so
one
would
suppose
some
folks
think
in
happened
in
awesley
goes
on
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel
youre
losing
it
so
you
have
to
stretch
what
i
said
and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
glad
to
know
youre
such
an
expert
nice
to
hear
some
an
authority
i
especially
appreciate
your
basis
of
knowledge
if
it
had
happened
you
would
have
know
it
since
you
are
such
an
authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
another
part
of
my
memories
was
that
while
most
damaged
building
were
burnt
some
were
in
rubble
based
on
what
i
remember
i
was
and
am
inclined
to
believe
an
old
sarge
or
two
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
did
fire
their
guns
now
then
weve
bored
the
shit
out
of
anyone
whose
bothered
to
read
this
far
and
all
youve
managed
to
say
is
that
you
dont

andy
freeman
says
in
article
jason
kratz
all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
thats
not
all
that
kratz
doesnt
know
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safety
is
supposed
to
do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
what
i
safety
is
supposed
to
do
its
basic
purpose
not
to
let
the
gun
fire
until
youre
ready
christ
ive
known
that
since
i
had
my
first
crosman
air
gun
you
dont
know
me
so
dont
make
assumptions
about
what
i
know
and
dont
know
i
do
know
that
the
glock
has
multiple
safties
from
reports
looking
at
them
at
a
gun
shop
and
friends
who
own
one
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the
gun
from
going
off
unless
thats
what
the
user
wants
with
glocks
one
says
i
want
the
gun
to
go
off
by
pulling
the
trigger
if
the
safeties
it
has
make
that
work
it
has
a
real
safety
no
matter
what
kratz
thinks
andy
from
the
things
i
have
readheard
glocks
are
always
knocked
because
of
the
trigger
safety
they
are
supposedly
harder
to
learn
to
use
properly
every
article
that
i
have
read
cant
be
wrong
about
the
damn
thing
and
dont
ask
me
to
quote
my
sources
because
i
dont
keep
a
ton
of
gun

andor

articles
laying
around
boy
you
cant
make
a
simple
statement
on
here
without
someone
getting
right
on

ass
no
wonder
why
there
are
so
many
problems
in
the
world
everyone
takes
everything
just
a
little
too
seriously
by
the
way
im
not
going
to
reply
to
any
of
this
stuff
anymore
as
someone
made

jason

writes
all
very
true
im
going
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friends
basically
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
course
thats
just
my
opinion
jason
at
the
risk
of
starting
the
my
gun
is
better
than
yours
flame
war
i
must
disagree
there
is
no
secret
in
handling
a
glock
in
fact
it
is
often
chosen
besides
its
other
merits
because
it
shoots
like
a
revolver
does
basically
it
can
limit
the
training
time
read
budget
due
to
the
fact
there
are
no
external
safties
other
than
the
trigger
hence
less
training
time
required
smith
wesson
among
other
types
are
chosen
due
to
the
fact
taht
they
do
have
the
external
safties
hammer
dropas
well
as
mag
drop
which
if
properly
used
have
saved
many
lives
when
mr
bad
snatched
the
gun
from
the
officer
and
tried
to
shoot
said
officer
the
gun
was
on
safe
and
would
not
fire
this
point
had
been
made
in
many
articles
in
various
gun
magazines
if
fact
one
author
cant
remember
who
staged
a
little
test
where
he
had
a
revolver
and
a
sw
on
safe
laying
on
a
table
and
asked
people
with
little
firearms
experience
to
on
his
signal
grab
the
gun
and
shoot
a
target
he
timed
the
people
using
each
gun
the
revolver
times
were
pretty
close
but
some
of
the
times
with
the
sw
were
in
minutes
or
the
person
just
gave
up
because
they
could
not
figure
out
the
saftey
you
dont
often
see
colt
autos
issued
due
to
the
light
trigger
which
can
be
accidentally
fired
in
a
stress
situation
opening
the
issuing
citycounty
etc
to
lawsuits
bad
press
etc
of
course
any
problem
can
be
overcome
with
enough
training
but
such
training
is
not
always
available
to
budget
crunched
departments
i
know
if
i
were
a
cop
i
would
want
something
like
a
sw
just
for
the
off
chance
of
the
gun
getting
taken
away
the
safety
doesnt
guarantee
that
mr
bad
wont
figure
it
out
and
shoot
me
but
it
could
buy
enough
time
to
draw
a
second
gun
and
shoot
mr
bad
before
its
too
late
dont
think
i
am
too
biassed
here
just
because
i
have
had
glocks
in
my
possession
at
one
time
because
i
have
had
a
as
well
in
fact
it
was
my
first
handgun
remember
the
ultimate
safety
is
you
the
operator
and
no
safety
is
going
to
stop
an
negligent
discharge
note
i
dont
say
accidental
if
you
break
the
rules
of
gun
handling
as
per
the
part
of
being
light
weight
and
looking
cool
i
agree
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
as
a
first
purchase

this

an
indication
i
dont

that
youre
not

when
the
drop

is
relevant
acquiring

in

you
can
buy
almost
all
kinds
of
weapons
in
norway
but
you
must
have
a
permit
and
a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
if
i
would

to
have
a

i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlicence
from
the
police
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
primary
objection
beyond
ones
based
on
the
ideal
of
rkba
that
it
is
simply
not
something
the
government
should
do
is
that
it
makes
guns
a
plaything
and
tool
of
the
rich
and
connected
it
discriminates
against
the
poor
is
selfdefense
considered
appropriate
and
if
so
under
what
conditions
are
you
allowed
for
instance
to
get
a
gun
for
protection
if
youre
going
to
be
carrying
a
very
large
sum
of
money
on
a
regular
basis
or
have
been
threatened
the
police
would
check
my
criminal
records
for
any
serious
crimes
andor
records
of
serious
mental
diseases
this
has
been
suggested
in
the
us
and
generally
supported
among
gun
owners
what
many
object
to
is
that
many
if
not
most
proposals
contain
a
sort
of
gotcha
clause
which
allows
an
arbitrary
denial
even
if
you
qualify
in
every
way
now
if
a
got
my
licence
i
would
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
gun
club
for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
at
this
point
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
general
a
drivers
licence
in
the
us
is
for
the
most
part
nothing
like
its
european
counterpart
i
understand
getting
one
is
far
more
difficult
there
than
here
in
the
us
its
a
joke
but
my
usual
objection
is
that
youre
discussing
two
different
things
for
instance
in
the
us
a
drivers
license
is
a
permit
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
road
it
is
not
necessary
to
own
one
or
to
operate
it
on
private
property
that
is
the
ability
to
require
driving
permits
is
generally
considered
to
arise
from
the
governments
legitimate
power
to
enact
reasonable
regulations
for
behavior
on
public
lands
a
permit
to
own
an
automobile
for
instance
which
is
far
closer
an
analogy
would
be
a
much
harder
thing
to
get
past
legally
since
it
wouldnt
be
based
on
making
regulations
on
public
property
but
in
restricting
activity
on
private
property
use
of
guns
in
crimes
in
norway
some
crimes
are
commited
with
guns
that
have
been
in
the
owners
arms
for
a
long
time
but
these
are
rather
the
exeption
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
this
varies
widely
one
thing
i
think
europeans
have
a
difficult
time
with
is
that
the
us
has
fifty
unique
jurisdictions
where
the
laws
from
one
state
to
another
can
be
as
radically
different
as
from
one
country
in
europe
to
another
some
places
allow
open
carry
of
both
guns
and
knives
some
allow
concealed
some
prohibit
both
or
allow
one
or
the
other
and
it
can
be
either
a
state
or
local
restriciton
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
the
question
must
be
asked
is
the
right
of
this
individual
affecting
the
rights
of
this
other
individual
what
we
usually
get
is
that
the
rights
of
this
group
meaning
some
individuals
within
this
group
here
defined
as
people
who
own
guns
are
adversely
affecting
the
rights
of
some
other
group
if
for
instance
bob
were
using
his
gun
to
attack
steve
youd
have
a
point
but
essentially
what
were
discussing
is
that
becuase
some
person
who
qualifies
as
a
member
of
the
group
people
who
own
guns
then
some
third
person
perhaps
in
another
time
zone
is
told
that
their
being
a
member
of
that
group
is
taking
away
somebody
elses
rights
its
like
trying
to
punish
all
newspapers
for
the
libel
commited
by
one
the
issue
i
believe
the
issue
is
guns
and
gunlegislation
the
issue
is
crime
violence
and
murder
the
question
is
to
what
extent
guns
and
gun
legislation
impact
those
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
of
course
not
it
would
be
nice
if
we
didnt
have
to
fear
that
other
people
might
get
it
into
their
twisted
little
minds
to
hurt
us
but
currently
we
dont
have
that
option
nor
do
i
expect
we
will
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns

some
states
do
no
state
does
in
any
case
theres
a
limit
to
which
the
state
may
enforce
its
wisdom
on
me
freedom
in
general
is
an
unwise
concept
if
you
preemptively
restrict
everything
which
might
be
unwise
then
freedom
becomes
a
meaningless
concept
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery
to
have
driverslicence
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
ill
raise
my

against

licenses
as
currently
implemented
theyre
a
waste
of
time
and
little
more
than
revanue
generation
for
the
state
and
ignored
by
a
startling
number
of
drivers
it
does
not
guarantee
a
level
of
skill
any
higher
than
is
necessary
to
get
your

on

you

i
was

something
just
did
not
make

i
was
wondering
if
someone
could
help
me
out
say
usc
except
as
provided
in

it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any

well
i
got
to
looking
in
my
law
dictionary
and
i
found
that
a
person
might
also
be
an
artificial
entity
that
is
created
by
government
and
has
no
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
so
what
i
dont
understand
is
how
a
statute
like
can
be
enforced
on
an
individual
so
someone
tell
me
how
my
government
can
tell
me
what
i
can
or
cannot
possess
just
passing
a
law
does
not
make
it

i
really
cant

what
youre

everyone

not
exactly
an
unconstitutional
act
is
not
law
it
confers
no

it
imposes
no

affords
no

it
creates
no

it
is
in
legal
contemplation
as
inoperative
as
though
it
had
never
been

norton

us
the
general
rule
is
that
an
unconstitutional
statute
though
having
the
form
and
name
of
law
is
in
reality
no
law
but
is
wholly
void
and
ineffective
for
any
purpose
since
unconstitutionality
dates
from
the
time
of
its
enactment
and
not
merely
from
the
date
of
the
decision
so
branding
it
no

if

i
would
have
to
get
an

from

and
to
be
a

the

would
check
my

serious

andor

now
if
a

i

for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
so
like
what
do
you
do
during
those
six
months
to
be
active
my
town
has
a
similar
requirement
and
its
rather
stupid
before
you
can
buy
a
handgun
you
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
a
gun
club
well
how
active
can
you
be
without
a
gun
chief
most
gun
owners
feel
a
check
of
criminal
records
for
crimes
and
mental
disorders
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
it
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
every
time
this
is
proposed
there
is
always
some
trapdoor
by
which
the
government
can
deny
your
purchase
even
if
you
are
perfectly
qualified
to
own
a
gun
and
we
oppose
this
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
since
the
fatal
accident
rate
for
licensed
automobile
drivers
in
the
us
is
around
times
the
fatal
accident
rate
of
largely
unlicensed
gun
owners
id
think
twice
before
using
this
analogy
besides
the
problem
is
criminal
use
of
guns
not
accidents
there
are
about
criminal
uses
of
guns
in
the
us
every
year
but
only
accidents
i
dont
think
its
necessary
to
spend
a
lot
of
energy
making
sure
a
criminal
can
shoot
a
gun
before
he
gets
one
just
like
the
check
most
gun
owners
feel
positively
about
requiring
safety
courses
if
they
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
they
already
have
one
state
doesnt
hold
the
courses
another
doesnt
fund
them
a
third
holds
them
only
once
a
year
with
limited
attendence
to
those
with
political
connections
is
this
fair
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
and
how
many
of
them
acquire
these
guns
from
legal
retail
outlets
how
many
are
borrowed
stolen
smuggled
bought
on
the
black
market
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
some
states
allow
only
open
carry
some
allow
only
concealed
carry
some
allow
both
some
allow
both
but
require
licenses
for
concealed
carry
all
you
can
say
is
if
one
of
these
modes
has
a
clear
advantage
over
another
in
terms
of
reducing
crime
or
any
other
public
good
then
state
legislators
someplace
are
doing
exactly
the
wrong
thing
which
means
that
they
really
dont
have
any
objective
reasons
for
these
laws
other
than
their

hotheaded
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
typically
the
only
criminals
who
can
affect
the
rights
of
all
the
other
people
are
criminals
in
government
offices
the
rest
of
our
criminals
affect
the
rights
of
only
one
or
a
few
people
at
a
time
and
they
do
this
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
possession
of
a
gun
by
someone
hurts
no
one
else
it
is
when
they
do
something
violent
with
that
gun
that
the
crime
occurs
of
course
it
is
a
crime
for
a
felon
or
exfelon
to
possess
a
gun
but
we
dont
feel
it
is
right
to
treat
common
citizens
who
have
lived
good
lives
as
if
they
were
just
prefelons
waiting
to
commit
crimes
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
i
dont
understand
this
sentence
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
life
isnt
fair
i
shouldnt
need
a
fire
extinguisher
either
or
flood
and
theft
insurance
or
to
lock
the
doors
of
my
house
and
car
but
pining
for
a
better
world
wont
do
anything
to
address
what
i
have
to
do
to
live
in
this
one
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do
none
of
ours
im
sure
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery
to
have
driverslicence
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
frankly
im
not
sure
i
know
what
good
a
drivers
license
does
anyone
either
the
people
who
drive
safely
never
use
it
and
the
people
who
drive
drunk
drive
without
it
however
a
car
is
a
good
tool
but
not
one
that
protects
my
right
to
life
i
rank
the
right
to
life
somewhere
north
of
the
right
to
travel
freely
im
not
a
pacifist
or
anti
gun
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence
or
because
they
feel
good
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
you
want
to
own
guns
personally
its
whether
or
not
you
think
that
all
people
should
be
forced
to
do
as
you
do
i
dont
have
any
problem
with
someone
who
says
they
would
never
own
a
gun
i
do
have
a
problem
with
someone
who
says
i
should
be
prevented
from
owning
one
too

packet
subject
re
long
gun
hearings
day
in
massachusetts
april
this
is
a
coauthored
report
from
two
of
us
who
were
there
gun
owners
action
league
our
state
rifle
association
started
the
day
with
a
rally
in
the
secluded
courtyard
behind
the
statehouse
at
it
was
looking
sparse
about
people
until
the
speaker
began
whereupon
about
more
people
followed
the
loudspeakers
from
wherever
they
had
been
lost
and
filled
out
the
area
something
proud
mike
yacino
of
goal
spoke
one
of
his
best
throwaway
lines
was
to
remind
us
that
all
of
us
holders
of
carry
permits
there
had
been
checked
and
certified
clear
of
all
crimes
by
the
state
while
the
people
in
the
statehouse
behind
us
only
had
to
be
certified
clean
of
election
fraud
to
hold
their
jobs
nancy
snow
and
amos
hamburger
were
busy
handing
out
id
buttons
and
sheets
describing
all
the
bills
to
be
presented
at
the
hearings
and
telling
people
where
to
find
their
own
representatives
and
in
too
many
cases
who
they
were
mike
warned
us
that
the
committee
was
going
to
suspend
its
rules
and
discuss
a
bill
that
hadnt
made
it
onto
the
official
list
it
seems
a
delegation
of
students
from
simons
rock
of
bard
college
alma
mater
of
wayne
lo
who
shot
up
the
place
with
an
sks
late
last
year
was
being
bussed
in
to
testify
for
a
bill
to
ban
all
sales
of
firearms
or
ammo
to
anyone
who
is
not
a
state
resident
the
hearings
were
originally
scheduled
in
the
large
gardner
auditorium
at
but
that
had
been
preempted
by
the
governors
hearings
on
the
framingham
eight
women
in
prison
for
killing
abusive
husbands
and
seeking
release
so
we
had
until
to
buttonhole
our
representatives
after
which
we
would
be
squashed
into
an
inadequate
hearing
room
one
of
my
representatives
staffers
was
somewhat
offensively
smarmy
he
said
oh
it
must
be
gun
hearings
day
again
the
gun
lobby
is
always
so
organized
every
year
i
got
a
little
pissed
and
replied
im
not
from
the
gun
lobby
im
from
your
district
at
your
second
reporter
arrived
in
time
to
notice
a
demonstration
going
on
in
front
of
the
statehouse
where
the
progunners
werent
randy
price
from
the
tv
news
was
there
in
his
mirror
reflective
shades
talking
to
one
of
the
antigun
types
and
several
simons
rock
antigun
closetheloophole
protestors
earlier
randy
had
covered
the
goal
rally
the
room
we
had
been
assigned
seated
about
remember
there
were
about
gun
owners
there
plus
another
students
and
teachers
from
bard
one
of
us
had
already
reserved
a
seat
the
other
never
got
closer
than
the
atrium
outside
and
there
was
a
crowd
behind
him
a
cop
took
up
station
at
the
entrance
and
prevented
the
rest
of
the
crowd
from
coming
in
soon
after
the
debate
started
a
loudspeaker
was
set
up
outside
in
the
hall
for
the
benefit
of
everyone
else
everyone
who
was
there
inside
and
outside
got
to
sign
up
on
a
sheet
saying
what
their
position
was
on
which
bills
most
of
us
signed
up
to
support
goals
position
on
all
bills
first
because
of
their
time
constraints
public
officials
got
to
testify
and
first
up
was
the
bill
that
nobody
had
seen
the
students
had
some
curfew
i
guess
currently
massachusetts
law
allows
a
nonresident
to
purchase
long
guns
or
ammo
from
a
local
dealer
provided
he
complies
with
the
laws
of
his
own
state
previously
the
law
was
similar
but
applied
only
to
nonresidents
from
states
adjoining
massachusetts
the
simons
rock
folks
called
the
current
law
a
loophole
and
wanted
it
closed
two
of
their
reps
spoke
about
wayne
lo
and
his
sks
assault
rifle
the
second
one
hodgekiss
a
cosponsor
had
done
his
homework
so
well
that
he
kept
confusing
montana
wayne
los
home
state
with
missouri
and
became
belligerent
when
about
five
gun
owners
in
the
gallery
corrected
him
after
his
second
muff
carr
from
gloucester
claimed
that
the
new
bill
would
put
the
law
back
the
way
it
was
but
he
was
lying
the
new
bill
allows
purchases
by
nonresidents
of
adjoining
states
only
if
they
have
licensing
in
their
own
state
as
strong
as
that
in
massachusetts
since
none
of
them
do
thats
that
some
of
the
things
these
two
said
were
really
offensive
in
some
of
these
other
states
anyone
can
buy
a
gun
as
long
as
hes
breathing
oooooo
we
have
some
very
very
good
gun
laws
in
massachusetts
if
only
the
other
states
would
adopt
the
same
type
of
laws
we
wouldnt
be
having
this
situation
but
they
wont
naughty
naughty
next
up
was
boston
city
councilman
albert
dapper
oneill
he
was
there
to
testify
progun
but
in
some
ways
he
was
a
liability
hes
reasonably
elderly
and
tends
to
wander
and
repeat
himself
plus
hes
almost
a
caricature
of
a
lawnorder
politician
he
badmouthed
the
aclu
said
violent
criminals
should
be
executed
and
that
if
he
were
judge
hed
give
arrestees
their
last
rights
pun
intended
on
the
spot
at
which
many
of
the
gun
owners
applauded
which
bothered
me
he
said
that
all
the
proposed
gun
restrictions
were
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
the
criminals
he
said
this
four
times
two
of
the
bills
under
consideration
would
allow
police
to
rescind
a
ccw
or
fid
and
confiscate
all
your
guns
if
someone
had
filed
a
restraining
order
against
you
note
that
the
filing
of
a
restraining
order
requires
no
warrant
no
hearing
no
evidence
and
no
conviction
just
an
accusation
senator
barrett
of
reading
testified
in
favor
of
it
and
patronized
the
progunners
there
several
times
by
saying
im
sure
all
the
gun
owners
here
will
agree
with
me
that
we
have
to
get
these
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
people
that
our
courts
have
convicted
i
havent
seen
such
a
disgustingly
disingenuous
performance
since
nixon
whined
that
he
wasnt
a
crook
barrett
also
spoke
in
favor
of
the
bill
making
the
fid
card
renewable
every
five
years
instead
of
permanent
as
it
is
now
the
stated
purpose
is
to
remove
fid
cards
from
those
who
have
become
ineligible
revenue
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
yeah
right
apparently
some
congressmen
think
were
stupid
enough
to
swallow
the
argument
that
its
preferable
to
process
million
renewals
every
cycle
in
the
vague
hope
of
catching
a
recent
felon
than
to
simply
take
the
goddamn
card
away
from
a
criminal
at
conviction
time
as
usual
hassle
the
lawabiding
instead
of
the
crook
the
two
cochairs
of
the
committee
were
rep
caron
and
sen
jujuga
jujuga
didnt
say
much
he
was
a
cosponsor
of
both
restraining
order
bills
but
caron
struck
me
as
a
sharp
guy
that
wouldnt
let
any
bad
logic
or
lies
on
the
part
of
either
side
to
go
unchallenged
he
was
a
cosponsor
of
one
of
the
restraining
order
bills
as
well
one
of
the
younger
reps
on
the
committee
forgot
his
name
was
vociferously
progun
somewhat
embarrassingly
so
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
but
his
arguments
seemed
to
be
confined
to
every
year
its
the
same
damn
thing
you
come
in
here
with
this
crap
its
nice
to
have
a
friend
on
the
committee
but
he
could
have
been
more
effective
at
about
it
was
clear
that
the
halljam
couldnt
continue
someone
came
out
of
another
meeting
hall
and
yelled
at
the
cop
because
the
loudspeaker
was
disturbing
their
meeting
so
the
loudspeaker
was
disconnected
so
they
found
a
bigger
hall
upstairs
one
of
us
had
to
leave
to
catch
his
charter
bus
and
so
missed
the
public
testimony
the
other
got
a
seat
this
time
caron
began
by
talking
about
how
he
got
his
fid
years
ago
left
the
state
and
then
returned
without
notifying
them
of
his
address
change
he
complained
that
the
state
record
system
was
not
uptodate
and
that
his
pd
back
in
his
city
of
birth
still
thought
he
lived
there
great
quote
if
you
purchase
a
gun
today
it
will
not
get
into
the
state
computer
system
until
this
was
also
an
argument
he
used
against
the
renewable
fid
card
testimony
was
heard
from
several
battered
women
one
of
whom
had
been
attacked
by
some
guy
in
his
who
had
an
fid
card
because
he
got
it
when
he
was
or
thereabouts
they
used
a
lot
of
emotion
and
said
how
they
were
scared
of
these
men
a
staffer
of
attorney
general
harshbarger
testified
in
favor
of
this
antigun
bill
saying
how
restraining
orders
were
granted
last
year
and
how
these
women
needed
to
be
protected
caron
noted
that
a
restraining
order
was
granted
for
days
and
then
a
hearing
was
held
to
determine
whether
the
order
would
be
extended
to
a
year
he
asked
whether
she
would
be
satisfied
if
the
fid
were
revoked
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
rather
than
after
the
initial
issuance
of
the
fid
she
gave
some
long
rambling
circumlocution
in
response
then
testimony
against
the
bill
was
heard
mike
yacino
who
looks
something
like
einstein
got
up
and
made
the
point
that
restraining
orders
were
issued
on
too
little
evidence
that
judges
like
to
issue
restraining
orders
just
to
let
things
cool
off
no
matter
who
they
think
is
right
man
or
woman
and
that
the
hearings
for
restraining
orders
are
lightning
sessions
with
little
time
to
consider
facts
atty
karen
mcnutt
spoke
with
him
a
few
times
during
his
testimony
other
progunners
got
up
to
testify
one
said
he
had
had
to
file
a
restraining
order
against
a
tenant
to
clear
her
out
and
that
she
countered
by
filing
one
against
him
he
noted
that
this
would
have
allowed
the
state
to
confiscate
his
guns
if
the
new
bill
became
law
one
of
the
junior
reps
noted
that
this
is
america
and
we
have
to
be
certain
that
individual
rights
are
respected
senator
jujuga
reiterated
this
saying
that
people
who
abuse
smaller
people
can
go
to
hell
as
far
as
i
care
but
we
have
to
be
careful
about
equating
conviction
with
a
restraining
order
point
and
match
senator
another
progunner
got
up
and
testified
that
he
didnt
know
his
citizenship
expired
every
years
and
that
a
drivers
license
was
a
privilege
not
a
right
like
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
a
third
got
up
and
said
the
problem
was
with
the
criminal
justice
system
and
argued
in
favor
of
a
death
penalty
bill
and
public
hangings
senator
jujuga
said
he
had
himself
tried
to
get
a
death
penalty
bill
passed
and
joking
responded
that
he
too
favored
public
hangings
the
speaker
then
responded
ill
make
you
a
deal
you
get
me
the
rope
and
ill
tie
the
noose
next
came
public
testimony
on
the
simons
rock
bill
a
teacher
testified
that
she
had
been
the
teacher
of
wayne
lo
and
that
he
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
shoot
people
inside
a
building
while
he
was
outside
without
his
evil
gun
she
said
that
the
loophole
should
be
closed
to
prevent
something
like
this
from
ever
happening
again
four
or
five
other
kids
testified
in
favor
of
this
bill
one
of
spilling
tears
for
the
good
legislators
one
of
the
students
actually
shot
by
wayne
lo
was
also
there
many
of
them
had
t
shirts
on
saying
as
long
as
one
person
can
buy
a
gun
in
anger
none
of
us
are
safe
support
gun
control
the
committee
was
reluctant
to
grill
or
correct
the
kids
except
for
caron
who
corrected
one
student
who
had
claimed
that
anyone
could
apply
for
an
fid
only
residents
can
get
fids
he
said
how
much
do
you
want
to
bet
that
this
kid
had
no
idea
he
had
been
conned
into
testifying
for
a
bill
that
would
cut
outofstaters
completely
off
yacino
and
mcnutt
spoke
again
this
time
noting
that
the
bill
as
written
would
affect
both
ammo
and
all
guns
possessed
by
outofstaters
karen
also
noted
that
hunters
in
ct
nh
and
vt
could
be
put
away
for
a
year
if
they
wandered
across
the
ma
boundary
somewhere
in
the
woods
and
got
challenged
by
game
wardens
yacino
underscored
the
fact
that
lo
could
have
gotten
an
fid
as
a
resident
student
and
hell
even
an
ccw
as
he
had
no
criminal
or
mental
record
one
junior
rep
was
upset
that
it
would
take
ma
residents
longer
to
buy
a
gun
than
outofstaters
and
thought
it
was
elitist
another
caron
said
that
we
need
the
protection
of
preventing
nonresidents
from
buying
without
an
fid
because
only
two
other
states
in
the
union
had
fidtype
cards
so
complying
with
all
the
laws
of
ones
home
state
was
not
enough
one
progun
speaker
replied
that
this
resembled
a
mother
watching
her
son
in
a
marching
band
and
exclaiming
everyones
out
of
step
but
johnny
all
the
bard
college
people
were
filing
out
as
the
progun
testimony
for
this
bill
was
made
and
thus
only
progunners
were
around
when
the
other
bills
came
under
consideration
the
main
bills
remaining
and
goals
position
were
o
and
four
others
notify
police
chiefs
so
they
can
pull
licenses
when
a
holder
is
convicted
strongly
supported
o
require
trigger
locks
on

the

bull

im
curious
to
know
do
they
plan
on
making
it
a
requirement
to
always
have
it
on

or
is
it
only
going
to
be
required
to
be

when
trying

medical

this
at
least
has
already
been
determined
the
blue
cross
medical
coverage
for
all
federal
employees
is
a
good
model
for
a
future
national
system
to
get
emergency
medical
care
anyone
so
insured
must
always
carry
their
blue
cross
card
before
entering
a
hospital
you
must
notify
blue
cross
or
they
will
refuse
to
pay
your
bills
in
an
emergency
where
you
must
be
treated
before
notifying
them
you
must
inform
them
within
hours
or
if
you
are
unable
to
do
so
for
medical
reasons
the
hospital
must
failing
to
do
so
within
hours
means
they
will
not
cover
the
hospitalization
in
you
need
your
card
to
notify
them
and
without
the
card
the
hospital
certainly
wouldnt
know
they
had
to
therefore
you
are
required
to
carry
the
card
at
all
times
or
do
without

have

where

were
practicing

how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
there
are
many
many
bad
things
going

in

area
also
i
have
several
friends
that
live
very
close
to
that
area
who
have
had
problems
with
some
of
these
folks
by
the
way
where
did
i
say
that
they
were
minorities
do
you
think
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
if
you
would
have
been
there
andy
it
wouldve
been
obvious
to
you
too
of
course
it
might
not
have
been
who
knows
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
was
there
i
live
here
and
i
know
that
they
were
gang
bangers
when
you
live
here
long
enough
it
becomes
pretty
easy
to
spot
them
via
gang
colors
gang
signs
etc
one
last
thing
my
sister
is
a
social
worker
she
makes
it
her
point
to
find
these
things
out
gang
signs
colors
etc
because
it
is
in
her
best
interest
to
do
so
she
is
nice
enough
to
let

know

so
i
can

violated
not
only
the
dictates
of
common
sense
but
of
usc
sec
which
was
intended
to
prevent
secret
lawmaking
by
administrative
bodies
these
practices
amply
documented
in
hearings
before
this
sub
committee
leave
little
doubt
that
the
bureau
has
disregarded
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
it
has
trampled
upon
the
second
amendment
by
chilling
exercise
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
by
lawabiding
citizens
it
has
offended
the
fourth
amendment
by
unreasonably
search
ing
and
seizing
private
property
it
has
ignored
the
fifth
amendment
by
taking
private
property
without
just
compensation
and
by
entrapping
honest
citizens
with
out
regard
for
their
right
to
due
process
of

the
rebuttal
presented
to
the

was
utterly
unconvincing
richard
davis
speaking
on

the

department
asserted
vaguely
that
the
bureaus
priorities
were
aimed
at
prosecuting
willful
violators
particularly
felons
ille
gally
in
possession
and
at
confiscating
only
guns
actually
likely
to
be
used
in

he
also
asserted
that
the

has
recently
made
great
strides
toward
achieving
these
priorities
no
documen

was
offered
for
either
of
these
assertions
in
hearings
before

however
expert
evidence
was
submitted
establishing
that
approximately
percent
of

were
aimed

the
agents
of
atf
have
proven
their
value
again
and
again
in
successful
legal
operations
to
curb
the
unlawful
possession
and
use
of
firearms
especially
in
the
area
of
drugrelated
crimes
it
enforces
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
calls
for
mandatory
minimum
sentences
for
repeat
felons
using
firearms
to
carry
out
an
illegal
activity
the
bureau
has
made
itself
a
key
component
in
preventing
gang
related
violence
also
both
by
educating
atrisk
youth
to
the
dangers
of
gang
membership
as
well
a
s
by
depriving
known
gangs
from
access
to
weapons
the
waco
texas
case
involved
the
execution
of
search
warrants
by
atf
on
the
branch
davidians
for
illegal
firearms
and
explosives
possession
automatics
semiautomatics
and
machineguns
in
addition
to
bombs
and
other
explosives
in
virtually
every

asked
to
trace
weapons
through
its
national

license
information
atf

execute

atf
working
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
in
texas
and
the
us
attorneys
office
felt
it
was
necessary
to
execute
these
warrants
in
order
to
legally
establish
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
conclude
a
long
and
thorough
investigation
of
illegal
gun
and
explosives
held
by
members
of
the
branch
davidians
in
addition
atf
carefully
selected
a
sunday
morning
knowing
from
their
source
inside
that
the
men
would
be
separated
from
the
women
and
children
and
not

the
area
where
it
was
known
that
the
illegal
weapons
were
stored

be
aware

howell
aka
david
koresh
spiritual
leader
of
the
branch
davidians
was
tipped
of
the
impending
execution
of
the
search
warrants
unfortunately
atf
lost
the
element
of
surprise
and
the
cult
was
able
to
arm
themselves
and
prepare
for
atfs
entry
into
the
compound
once
a
hostage
situation
presented
itself
the
atf
asked
the
fbi
to
become
involved
since
the
fbi
is
skilled
in
hostage
negotiations
in
addition
and
military
tanks
were
brought
in
due
to
the
serious
nature
of
the
situation
and
firepower
of
the
branch
davidians
based
on
what
i
have
learned
about
atfs
role
in
the
branch
davidian
raid
i
believe
the
agency
acted
responsibly
i
am
however
deeply
saddened
by
the
loss
of
lives
of
the
law
enforcement
agents
who
attempted
to
enter
the
compound
and
the
civilian
members
of
the
cult
i
fully
expect
the
department
of
treasury
to
conduct
a
thorough
evaluation
with
representatives
from
law
enforcement
outside
the
department
to
be
headed
by
the
assistant
secretary
for
enforcement
in
addition
atf
will
conduct
its
own
review
of
the
waco
operation
i
look
forward
to
reviewing
the
findings
of
the
evaluators
and
hope
this
situation
in

will
be
brought
to

this

what
confuses
me
according
to
the

a

has
a
well

structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the

besides
the
advantage
of

which
the

the
existence
of

a

can

than
to
have

in
order
to
see
that

it
will
be
necessary

alexander
hamilton
federalist
paper
speaking
of
standing
armies
if
circumstances
should
at
any
time
oblige
the
government
to
form
an
army
of
any
magnitude
that
army
can
never
be
formidable
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
while
there
is
a
large
body
of
citizens
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
them
in
discipline
and
the
use
of
arms
who
stand
ready
to
defend
their
own
rights
and
those
of
their
fellowcitizens
but
surely
hamilton
and
madison
didnt
mean
the
people
when
they
said
people
right
thats
why
the
amendment
refers
to
the
right
of
the
militia
your
average
year
old
male
does
not
fall
into
the
definition
youre
right
the
militia
consists
of
all
able
bodied
males
and
probably
females
under
current
interpretation
therefore
most
members
of
the
militia
the
one
the
every
gun
advocate
refers
to
are
not
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
and
therefore
are
not
directly
the
amendment
does
nor
refer
to
well
organized
it
says
well
regulated
i
have
some
targets
you
may
examine
if
you
wish
to
check
how
well
regulated
i
am
mentioned
in
the
amendment
if
this
amendment
wanted
to
allow
every
member
of
the
militia
to
keep
and
bear
arms
why
did
it
specificly
mention
a
well
organized
militia
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
correct
thats
why
the
right
is
reserved
to
the
people
and
that
was
to
insure
the
people
could
form
a
well
regulated
militia
not
a
well
organized
militia
it
could
be
argued
that
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
is
separate
from
the
last
part
if
so
why
was
it
include
in
the
same
atomic
unit
of
written
what
do
atomic
units
have
to
do
with
this
argument
any
moron
can
set
hbar
c
instead
of
a
separate
sentence
oh
i
see
what
your
question
is
why
dont
you
read
the
federalist
papers
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
but
what
does
madison
know
about
the
grammatical
style
of
the
he
only
wrote
it
the
amendment
also
implies
that
the
right
to
arms
has
to
due
with
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
federalist
papers
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
gives
many
examples
of
how
this
militia
protects
the
security
of
a
free
state
all
these
examples
are
actions
of
a
very
organized
force
not
some
john
q
public
with
a
gun
thats
obviously
because
youve
never
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
is
that
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulated
militias
shall
not
be
infringed
that
is
people
have
the
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
this
well
organized
militia
will
of
course
provide
training
in
how
to
use
arms
and
in
basic
military
tactics
these
training
members
of
the
militia
can
keep
and
bear
the
arms
cant
read
huh
show
me
where
the
document
says
well
organized
militia
lastly
reading
through
the
federalist
papers
on
well
organized
militia
it
is
very
clear
that
many
of
the
reasons
for
these
militias
one
reason
stated
is
the
protection
from
a
standing
army
these
days
the
standing
army
could
easily
defeat
a
group
consisting
of
every
year
old
male
and
female
not
in
the
armied
forces
that
is
exactly
why
every
person
should
be
allowed
to
own
any
weapon
currently
in
use
in
the
armed
forces
another
reason
stated
for
well
organized
militias
is
to
reduced
the
need
for
a
standing
army
well
the
us
armied
forces
have
been
a
standing
army
for
more
than
half
the
history
of
the
us
but
the
major
reason
is
to
protect
against
that
very
same
army
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
reason
for
the
second
amendment
to
give
the
people
protection
from
the
us
government
by
guaranteeing
that
the
people
can
over
through
the
government
if
necessary
is
a
little
bit
of
an
anachronism
is
this
day
and
age
maybe
its
time
to
rethink
how
this
should
be
done
and
amend
the

you
know
ahhh
talkpoliticsguns
the
kindler
gentler
newsgroup
who
would
have
thought
no
not
exactly
the
only
reason
for
this
sort
of
restriction
is
the
possible
endangerment
of
others
a
poorly
maintained
rifle
is
dangerous
but
only
to
the
user
since
it
doesnt
endanger
others
there
is
no
justification
for
such
restrictions
i
remind
you
of
shrapnel
i
consider
a
reasonable
space
limitation
but
make
no
mistake
a
gun
blowing
up
is
a
hazard
to
those
nearby
say
in
the
next
lane
at
the
range
my
point
was
at
what
distance
or
level
of
threat
we
draw
the
line
is
it
the
endangerment
of
others
so
we
do
a
restriction
or
the
possibility
of
being
shot
hence
we
draw
a
mile
restriction
or
a
nuke
and
draw
a
mile
restriction
to
me
they
al
suffer
from
the
fundamental
flaw
that
they
restrict
based
upon
the
instrument
rather
than
placing
the
responsibility
for
usage
squarely
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
user
perhaps
sen
metzenbaum
declaring
the
barrett
light
fifty
an
assault
rifle
has
made
this
more
apparent
to
me
since
the
barrett
has
only
range
and
acurracy
going
for
it
they
have
determined
that
their
lives
are
worth
the
effort
to
protect
their
homes
and
families
using
nuclear
weapons
close
to
home
will
not
accomplish
this
i
disagree
on
the
grounds
that
a
house
can
be
rebuilt
much
more
easily
than
my
family
once
i
have
died
i
assume
that
word
would
get
to
the
citizens
that
such
an
attack
was
planned
if
this
is
not
the
case
the
tactical
and
strategic
implications
change
quite
a
bit
personally
my
home
is
worth
say
twenty
martians
intent
on
taking
over
the
world
my
family
all
of
them
the
balancing
act
here
is
hard
to
judge
sitting
at
my
desk
there
is
however
another
problem
in
any
case
of
civil
war
the
strength
of
the
militias
fighting
on
each
side
should
reflect
the
popular
will
if
the
public
is
split
versus
then
the
minorities
militias
should
be
at
a
disadvantage
such
a
need
for
popular
support
would
hopefully
prevent
insurrections
unless
the
people
really
were
behind
the
rebels
but
heavy
weapons
owned
by
a
small
fraction
of
the
militia
could
distort
this
what
if
the
minority
included
all
the
tank
and
artillery
owners
that
seems
to
be
the
case
already
given
that
heavy
weapons
arent
commonly
owned
by
the
citizenry
with
such
low
numbers
obviously
due
to
cost
i
dont
think
the
superior
weapons
are
going
to
be
of
great
effect
against
a
numerically
superior
foe
furthermore
it
is
even
more
doubtful
their
training
includes
proper
tactical
movements
that
best
utilize
tanks
whereas
the
commonly
rifleman
is
not
so
hampered
in
effectiveness
i
think
it
is
vital
to
avoid
such
a
situation
where
a
small
minority
would
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
gaining
political
power
through
violence
to
prevent
this
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
control
of
heavy
weapons
eg
those
which
only
a
small
number
of
individuals
would
own
and
whose
firepower
would
grossly
distort
the
relation
between
popular
support
and
military
strength
to
someone
other
that
individual
militiamen
this
is
certainly
not
a
good
thing
but
i
think
it
is
the
lesser
of
two
evils
whoever
controls
these
weapons
must
be
a
democratic
body
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
i
had
envisioned
that
the
armorer
perhaps
the
officers
of
a
select
group
and
the
like
would
exercise
control
over
the
heavier
more
complex
weapons
but
if
joe
bob
owns
an
old
sherman
tank
i
certainly
wouldnt
ask
him
to
give
it
up
follow
orders
from
the
officers
yes
since
the
expense
of
a
tank
is
so
large
though
chances
are
it
would
be
jointly
purchased
and
should
therefore
be
jointly
maintained
and
operated
here
i
think
we
have
to
be
carefull
about
which
state
we
are
talking
about
certainly
one
role
of
the
militia
is
to
overthrow
a
repressive
government
and
it
would
be
completely
destructive
to
that
end
for
that
same
government
to
control
the
militias
arms
but
the
united
states
have
several
levels
of
government
each
able
to
act
independently
but
not
all
likely
targets
of
rebelion
as
such
rebelions
against
state
and
local
governments
are
very
unlikely
i
think
therefore
that
the
state
or
possibly
local
governments
could
safely
be
allowed
to
keep
the
select
militias
heavy
weapons
the
risk
of
abuse
while
still
something
to
consider
is
far
less
than
the
similar
risk
were
the
federal
government
in
control
this
ill
agree
with
to
a
point
the
state
having
control
over
the
heavy
weapons
should
not
be
justification
for
the
state
to
have
them
centrally
located
keep
them
spread
out
such
that
the
ability
of
the
state
to
lock
them
up
isnt
so
easy
otherwise
i
would
have
to
assume
that
state
control
would
rest
on
the
authority
of
the
governor
and
militia
officers
that
is
eaxctly
why
i
think
they
should
be
removed
the
select
militia
should
privide
the
militias
heavy
weapons
and
highlytrained
specialists
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlines
above
i
think
these
heavy
weapons
tanks
artillery
aircraft
etc
are
better
off
being
kept
by
local
governments
than
by
a
small
number
of
individuals
however
local
governments
shouldnt
be
able
to
use
the
select
militia
without
the
support
to
the
people
ideally
the
general
militia
under
the
direct
control
of
the
people
and
the
select
militia
under
the
direction
of
democratic
local
governments
would
opperate
together
but
even
in
the
worst
case
the
general
militia
should
be
able
to
functional
without
the
select
militia
similarly
the
select
militia
should
be
incapable
of
action
without
the
aid
of
the
general
militia
im
having
a
hard
time
seeing
how
these
heavy
weapons
fairly
few
in
numbers
could
not
be
easily
wielded
by
a
few
people
with
government
support
just
as
you
argued
above
that
the
weapons
should
be
divvied
up
and
under
democratic
control
so
one
side
doesnt
have
all
of
them
i
cant
see
where
this
situation
is
alleviated
in
having
the
select
militia
holding
all
the
weapons
and
the
unorganized
militia
being
the
infantry
i
think
a
better
mix
is
called
for
but
i
would
argue
that
the
federal
army
should
rely
upon
the
select
militia
and
the
unorganized
militia
for
the
bulk
of
its
infantry
units
consider
then
the
effect
of
removing
the
national
guards
infantry
and
placing
the
guard
under
the
control
of
local
governments
the
governmentcontroled
select
militia
could
not
fight
effectively
without
infantry
support
provided
by
the
general
militia
an
inherently
infantry
organization
on
the
other
hand
the
general
militia
could
function
although
at
a
disadvantage
without
the
backing
of
local
governments
and
the
select
militia
we
have
to
assume
that
there
would
be
those
who
would
side
with
the
governmentcontrolled
forces
and
if
theyve
all
the
equipment
an
infantry
force
the
size
would
be
in
trouble
id
like
to
see
that
heavy
stuff
say
tanks
offset
by
the
local
troups
having
a
few
and
antitank
weapons
in
their
armory
these
would
be
much
more
useful
to
infantry
than
the
tank
would
be
when
cost
and
training
requirements
are
figured
in
i
suppose
im
quibbling
over
what
constitutes
heavy
equipment
but
a
mechanized
infantry
unit
is
what
builds
dikes
in
times
of
flood
sets
up
disaster
relief
cities
and
the
like
i
would
much
rather
see
these
things
handled
by
the
local
general
militias
so
would
i
but
the
resources
often
arent
available
to
outfit
local
units
well
enough
thus
we
will
certainly
have
to
call
in
others
and
a
mechanized
unit
carries
more
stuff
faster
than
anything
else
perhaps
the
national
guard
isnt
as
close
to
my
conception
of
the
select
militia
as
i
thought
i
was
considering
them
to
be
the
heavy
weaponsarmor
arm
of
the
militia
not
the
infantry
arm
of
the
regular
army
perhaps
our
ideas
of
heavy
weapons
are
different
i
think
main
battle
tanks
selfpropelled
artillery
and
and
up
field
pieces
are
heavy
stuff
troop
carriers
ton
trucks
humvees
old
tanks
howitzers
are
more
the
stuff
of
a
mechanized
infantry
actually
this
is
what
the
guard
units
in
iowa
are
currently
fielding
in
some
units
perhaps
it
is
just
my
innate
fear
of
having
the
real
heavy
equipment
under
state
control
with
little
but
numbers
and
light
stuff
to
act
as
a
deterrent
allowing
main
battle
tanks
to
the
states
should
be
balanced
with
antitank
capability
in
the
local
ranks
similarly
local
units
would
need
to
band
together
quickly
hence
small
and
fast
response
means
mechanized
infantry
finally
the
militia
is
more
than
just
fighting
equipment
is
needed
for
other
responses
the
federal
army
im
convinced
should
have
a
very
minumum
of
infantry
relying
on
the
state
and
local
militias
for
these
functions

there
is

with
this

personal

some
crimes
are
commited
with

that
have
been

these
are
rather
the
exeption

accuire

that

think
its
ok
to

not

i

also
attract

doing
this
id
rather
be
lost
in

than
be
the

think
of

and
you
can
see
where
intimidation
is
not
the
preferable
method
for
the
normal
citizen
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not
as
hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
ask
any
historian

millitary
with
an
knowledge
of
europe
or
ask
any
german
who
served
in
norway
in
aggressive
towards
whom
southerners
germans
precisely
why
i
think
your
society
is
less
violent
weapons
aside
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
masses
editor
barf
dan
then
the
masses
have
the
same
rights
as
the
individuals
because
everything
comes
down
to
the
individual
in
one
instance
or
another
to
draw
an
analogy
norway
is
involved
in
the
eec
the
usa
in
involved
in
nato
the
eec
requires
certain
changes
in
your
laws
nato
requires
no
such
changes
in
usa
law
these
laws
affect
citizens
and
hence
norway
is
saying
europe
is
more
important
than
say
norwegians
having
motorcycles
that
make
over
in
the
usa
wed
likely
tell
the
eec
to
get
stuffed
since
the
eec
has
no
business
in
our
eyes
in
telling
us
how
much
horsepower
we
can
safely
ride
while
i
note
that
our
own
state
governments
often
play
with
game
with
the
federal
government
in
essence
this
is
a
cultural
difference
between
us
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
it
shouldnt
since
neither
of
our
countries
has
managed
to
remove
criminals
from
society
in
america
we
feel
and
remember
we
have
individual
states
that
are
larger
than
your
country
that
if
the
police
cannot
protect
us
then
we
must
do
so
ourselves
the
criminals
in
our
country
are
quite
violent
hence
we
prepare
for
them
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do
if
you
believe
its

why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
we
dont
email
me
to
find
out
just
how
difficult
it
really
is
in
this
country
it
is
easier
than
in
yours
but
theft
is
far
easier
than
the
troubles
we
go
through
to
purchase
over
here
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
they
are
neither
they
are
an
option
we
would
never
force
you
to
own
guns
if
you
lived
here
we
would
however
fight
to
keep
that
option
open
to
you
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence

because

feel
good

this
may
be
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
is
my
opinion
that
most
educated
or
well
informed
people
of
this
country
have
some
distrust
of
the
government
this
should
exist
because
as
a
bureaucracy
any
government
given
enough
time
will
tend
to
exist
for
it
self
and
not
for
the
original
purpose
it
was
created
for
this
distrust
by
the
people
should
keep
those
in
power
inline
that
and
a
properly
functioning
press
when
a
sensationalism
oriented
press
portrays
a
group
of
people
as
nuts
or
crazies
a
violation
of
those
peoples
civil
rights
seem
justified
since
we
as
americans
have
the
gurantee
of
rights
as
enumerated
in
the
constitution
to
include
the
ammendment
the
government
must
appease
the
publics
opinion
or
risk
voted
out
of
existance
or
if
it
has
become
corrupt
enough
to
tamper
with
domocratic
process
itself
being
thrown
out
by
force
our
government
as
it
stands
must
appease
the
public
therefore
the
official
press
releases
portray
the
bds
as
fanatics
who
are
a
threat
to
public
safety
we
must
not
prejudge
people
based
on
one
sided
information
so
far
the
only
information
that
we
are
being
given
is
comming
from
the
very
agency
that
was
embarrased
by
the
bdbranch
davidians
sp
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
make
the

if
they
were

as
lawabiding
citizens
then
theyatf

no

my
understanding

to
believe
that
the
national
firearms
act
which
allows
the

guns
has
been
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
since
two
federal

courts
at

and
since
i
believe
the
only
reason
atf
was

in

is
because
of
firearms
violations
it
would
be
interesting

been
tried
in

many

support

the

that

theyve

biological

hell
the

that
anyone
can
obtain

by
sending

these

are
verboten
to
english
citizens
from

which
doesnt
surprise
me
based
on
the
mistrust
of
the

against

if
we

even
agree
on
keeping

out

can
there
be
any
hope

so
you
are

we

prohibiting

will
you
pass

a
few
comments
on
the
atfs
botched
handling
of
this
case
attempting
to
storm
the
compound
in
broad
daylight
the
explanation
we
were
given
at
least
at
one
point
was
that
they
thought
the
cult
members
would
be
at
religious
services
my
only
comment
on
this
bit
of
idiocy
is
that
if
youre
going
to
operate
as
a
quasimilitary
unit
youd
better
understand
basic
military
tactics
one
cardinal
rule
is
that
only
a
fool
plans
an
operation
where
if
one
assumption
is
incorrect
the
operation
will
fail
disastrously
we
were
told
that
atf
got
four
agents
killed
because
they
were
outgunned
they
didnt
expect
such
heavy
resistance
when
questioned
about
why
such
an
overwhelming
militarystyle
assault
was
planned
we
were
told
that
it
was
because
the
cultists
were
thought
to
be
heavily
armed
can
you
say
contradictory
i
knew
you
could
the
batf
has
had
a
bad
reputation
for
years
as
a
bunch
of
arrogant
hotdoggers
i
was
talking
to
relatives
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
referred
to
them
as
a
bunch
of
crockett
and
tubbs
wannabes
im
more
than
ever
convinced
thats
right
on
target
an
anecdote
not
related
to
the
waco
fiasco
is
that
apparently
the
batf
screwed
up
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
world
trade
center
bombing
theres
now
an
excellent
chance
some
of
the
forensic
evidence
gathered
by
the
fbi
will
not
be
admissible
in
court
this
is
not
hearsay
i
was
told
this
by
a
relative
of
my
wifes
who
happens
to
be
an
fbi
agent
his
opinion
of
the
batf
was
ummm
well
lets
just
say
uncomplimentary
i
have
still
not
been
presented
with
one
iota
of
evidence
that
the
bds
had
any
of
the
alleged
illegal
weaponry
which
was
the
reason
for
the
raid
in
the
first
place
btw
were
still
hearing
this
justification
ag
reno
on
cnn
yesterday
made
references
to
this
issue
without
any
substantiation
she
also
waved
around
the
hes
a
child
abuser
and
we
heard
he
was
beating
the
children
flag
sigh
a
point
re
the
feds
in
general
their
handling
of
the
whole
siege
reflected
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
of
the
probable
thought
processes
of
the
cultists
ag
reno
said
they
pushed
the
button
because
they
were
afraid
a
mass
suicide
was
in
the
offing
my
only
comment
on
that
is
that
if
the
cultists
were
that
close
to
the
edge
what
the
hell
did
she
think
their
reaction
would
be
to
an
hourslong
assault
on
the
compound
where
holes
were
punched
in
the
walls
and
cs
gas
pumped
in
if
i
were
a
bd
id
expect
the
forces
of
the
godless
government
to
assault
me
at
any
time
in
that
light
whether
they
torched
themselves
or
drank
jim
jones
koolaid
is
irrelevant
also
look
at
how
the
siege
was
conducted
bright
lights
loud
rock
music
cutting
off
communications
and
other
contact
with
the
outside
all
measures
designed
to
make
the
bds
feel
more
and
more
isolated
and
threatened
this
might
have
been
a
great
strategy
if
they
were
dealing
with
criminals

re

does
anyone
have
any

about

of

im
just
curious
because
if
it
were
a
small
town
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
possibly
not
it
sure
didnt
take
it
very
long
to
burn
down
though
i
was
watching
abc
and
it
only
took
like
a
little
over
minutes
to
burn
down
waco
is
a
city
of
about
people
the
population
temporarily
raised
to
about
people
when
all
the
feds
and
state
police
officers
arrived
i
tell
you
what
i
stayed
in
a
hotel
room
about
miles
from
the
bd
compound
around
weeks
ago
i
have
never
felt
more
paranoid
in
my
whole
life
there
were
at
least
state
police
in
the
hotel
the
claim
we
had
the
water
turned
off
so
the
fire
engines
had
to
bring
their
own
doesnt
hold
up
if
they
had
cut
off
the
water
they
surely
could
have
turned
it
back
on
just
as
quickly
they
just
didnt
want
to
there
were
some
scores
to
settle
message
to
anybody
else
is
very
clear
dont
fuck
with
us
we
will
do
you
in
not
that
i
am
one
to
believe
that
everything
that
the
government
tells
us
is
true
but
if
that
was
the
message
they
wanted
to
send
why
did
they
wait
days
i
think
the
message
would
be
better
sent
by
charging
in
there
right
away
not
waiting
for
days
and
pounding
them
with
sound
etc
a
bunch
of
dead
bd
members
are
not
going
to
be
so
able
to
tell
their
side
of
the
story
so
now
all
we
have
is
the
story
according
to
the
batf
and
fbi
also
mr
care
about
the
rights
of
people
clinton
or
his
administration
approved
this
action
fbi
said
washington
had
approved
it
they
fbi
said
the
gas
masks
used
by
the
bds
have
a
finite
life
and
were
close
to
running
out
why
couldnt
they
have
just
waited
well
there
are
people
supposedly
alive
they
can
tell
their
story
as
far
as
bill
clinton
is
concerned
dont
you
think
he
has
more
pressing
matters
to
attend
to
besides
some
small
group
of
people
in
texas
how
about
bosnia
now
theres
a
problem
why
couldnt
they
have
waited
they
waited
too
long
as
it
is
something
should
have
been
done
earlier
they
gov
is
trying
to
say
it
was
a
mass
suicide
in
the
past
they
had
expressed
this
was
a
real
possibility
but
now
they
decided
it
wasnt
a
possibility
so
they
could
go
on
with
the
raid
apparantly
what
they
feel
korash
was
or
was
not
capable
of
or
going
to
do
was
driven
by
what
was
most
convenient
at
the
time
now
this
means
that
the
public
and
media
will
forget
about
all
this
having
become
weary
of
it
this
has
already
happened
for
many
people
there
will
be
no
investigation
independent
or
otherwise
or
a
whitewash
very
much
a
possibility
there
will
be
no
unsealing
of
the
warrant
and
related
documents
what
anybody
will
know
about
this
incident
will
be
the
batf
version
with
the
way
our
government
is
i
wouldnt
doubt
it
the
batf
has
just
been
given
carte
blanche
for
further
abuses
with
the
effective
support
and
approval
of
the
administration
clinton
said
on
the
news
that
he
knew
about
what
was
happening
but
that
it
was
all
in
the
hands
of
the
fbi
that
is
if
you
choose
to
believe
the
media
there
will
be
more
abuses
with
no
concern
of
administration
censure
the
precident
has
been
established
that
the
feds
can
kill
in
quantity
to
achieve
their
aims
especially
if
the
target
is
excercising
their
rights
under
the
second
amendment
and
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
is
a
governmentdeclared
unnice
fellow
if
they
had
rocket
launchers
and
such
as
the
press
and
gov
claims
why
shouldnt
they
have
done
something
what
possible
use
would
a
religious
cult
have
for
a
rocket
launcher
also
is

in

im

they
feel
the
same
way
god
bless

of
the

tense
well
maybe
i
am
overreacting
but
i
see
on
the
tv
as
i
am
typing
where
maybe
maybe
not
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
should
be
raised
about
this
incident
the
problem
is
who
will
do
it
and
be
heard
govt
spoksewoman
the
new
attorney
general
known
to
be
almost
rabid
about
private
ownership
of
guns
wants
to
ban
assault
guns
and
just
about
everything
else
is
saying
the
fbi
had
amazing
restraint
then
falls
back
into
the
official
goverenment
line
about
how
the
bd
were
guity
of
child
abuse
and
were
into
it
in
an
ongoing
basis
and
so
on
note
that
according
to
the
liberal
elite
giving
a
child
a
spanking
is
regarded
as
child
abuse
seriously
if
it
gets
known
the
state
can
take
your
child
away
from
you
if
you
spank
your
kid
she
also
is
saying
which
state
is
that
the
federal
government
or
an
individual
state
government
clinton
personally
approved
this
operation
she
told
him
it
was
appropriate
and
so
on
and
he
said
ok
do
it
somehow
i
am
not
surprised
the
people
must
know
who
is
boss
who
is
in
charge
and
it
is
obviouly
no
longer
the
people
it
seems
to
me
that
the
people
havent
been
in
charge
for
a
long
time
if
they
really
were
i
dont
think
the
government
would
be
doing
as
many
things
as
it
has
in
the
past
and
i
maintain
the
appropriate
response
as
far
as
this
raid
by
batf
is
concerned
regarding
child
abuse
is
so
what
batf
are
not
our
child
protective
services
police
yet
after
all
the
bd
had
been
tried
on
that
charge
before
and
found
not
guilty
the
govt
people
have
pretty
much
gone
silent
on
the
terrible
illegal
guns
bd
supposedly
has
and
stress
the
continued
child
abuse
apparantly
to
make
it
a
seem
as
sort
of
a
rescue
operation
figuring
everyone
hates
child
abusers
and
anything
is
ok
to
use
against
them
occasional
references
to
ammunition
possesed
by
the
bds
and
so
on
is
irrelevant
it
is
not
illegal
to
have
ammunition
yet
true
but
is
it
illegal
to
have
a
rocket
launcher
am
i
having
a
vain
hope
that
an
honest
investigation
will
occur
on
this
thing
or
will
it
simply
be
whitewashed
under
the
rug
and
business
as
usual
will
continue
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
new
order
who
will
be
given
the
official
title
of
thought
police
i
wonder
and
if
clinton
and
friends
have
their
way
highly
likely
at
this
point
the
new
order
government
will
also
have
all
the
guns
so
what
if
is
going
to
be
ten
years
late
i
think
we
are
going
to
discover
that
we
will
be
paying
dearly
for
putting
this
fellow
in
office
for
decades
to
come
even
some
diehard
supporters
are
having
serious
doubts
about
their
savior
shit
if
people
dont
get
what
they
want
right
away
there
is
an
instant
problem
clinton
has
only
been
in
office
for
a
few
months
give
him
a
chance
to
get
something
done
the
guy
had
a
lot
of
shit
thrown
in
his
lap
in
the
beginning
give
him
a
chance
to
work
on
things
a
little
as
they
say
rome
wasnt

yes

went

no

think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
napalm
then
let
the

stove
inside
ignite
it
well
actually
the

started
the
fire
themselves
the
last
i
heard

est
eight
people
ran
out
into
the
feilds
surrounding
the

all
were
captured

two
admitted
to
setting
the

i
dont
buy
your

theory
at

it
would

made

is
more

the

i

if

are

about

due
to
several
encounters
with
formerly

dogs
these
critters
aint
scared
of
folks
and
can
get
aggressive
on
staying
at

saw
someone
sitting

cleaning
his

softly
i
backed
away
and
hiked
another
miles
to
get
out

ill
freely
admit
it
here
im
not
afraid
of
guns
im
afraid
of
people
that
bring
them
into
the

id
count
that
as
a
fear
of

somebody
having
the
sense
to
keep
their
weapons
maintained
isnt
as
likely
to
present
a
threat
the
army
taught
me
to
clean
any
weapons
daily
since
they
usually
need
it
regardless
of
whether
theyve
been
used
youd
be
amazed
how
sweaty
a
holster
can
get
or
how
much
trail
dust
will
get
in

i
guess
youd
be
scared

me
and
my

seems
the

were

considered
it
heresy
to
be

usually
you
wouldnt

they
tended
to
avoid
public
scrutiny
of
course
that
may
be
the
way
to
solve
the

just
carry

display
it

koresh

were
basically

some

violations
may
have
been
committed
and
i
wouldnt
have
disapproved
of
prosecuting
him
for
those
violations
however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children
and
other
noncombatants
i
dont
see
they
couldnt
just
leave
a
token
guard
on

and
wait
the

out
i
dont
approve
of
the

approach
and
if
it
caused
the

to
be
started
i
think
the

agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in
jail
however
if
koreshs
response
to
the

was
to

it

everyone

how
to

his

what
may

is
that
there
are
politicians

then
there

politicians
and
that
the

political
science
is
subject

more
than
one
interpretation
years
ago
we
heard
how
scientists
were
worried
that
a
new
ice

might
be
coming
and
later
on
that
nuclear
winter
smoke
and
dust
thrown
into
the
atmosphere
by
fullscale
international
unpleasantness
was
a
possibility
something
like
that
may
even
have
killed
the
dinosaurs
what
we
didnt
hear
was
that
no
actual
data
supported
any
of
this
that
realworld
events
the
burning
of
kuwaiti
oil

tended
to
discredit
it
that
mostly
it
was
propaganda
meant
to
weaken
values
that
made
america
the
most
successful
culture
in
history
and
that
the
dinosaurs
probably
died
of
something
like
the
plague
when
continents
drifted

exposing
them
to

we

youd
never

that

than

for

the

arent
entirely
to
blame
as
ignorant
of
science
as
they
are
of
everything
they
trust
scientists
to
unscrew
the
inscrutable
the
trouble
is
that
todays
scientists
have
agendas
of
their

nobody
in

wellspring

is

this
final

on
decades
of
antinuclear

resting
on
foundations
of

have
failed
to
erase
the
fact
that
nuclear

is
the
safest
cleanest
most
efficient
source
of

known
to

and
more
to
the
point
that
the

of
the

been

by
the

and
what
the

on

is
that
although
some
harm

may

detected
it
was
less

of

than
that
associated

its
enough
to
make
you
wonder

anything

the

that
of

given
a

how
am
i

to

nicotine

the

on

spared

thanks

youre
coming

needless

disagree

you
believe

i
find
it
hard

you

nuclear

biological

if

cannot
even

on

out

i
dont

the

devoid

to
suggest
that

remember
this
was
a

warrant
there
were
no

except
the

all
information
filtered
through
the

all
they
had

was
allow

the

couldve

with

while

the
complete
lack

any

other
than
the
fbi
really
causes
me
concern
sick
to
my
stomach
and
getting
sicker
from
all
the
government
apologists
well
put
jim
i
am
as
concerned
about
the
medias
complicity
in
this
growing
coverup
can
you
imagine
the
media
outrage
the
lawsuits
the
investigations
that
would
emit
if
the
government
kept
the
media
away
from
any
other
story
particularly
if
a
republican
administration
had
been
behind
it
whats
going
on
here
lets
look
beyond
the
initial
blunder
and
examine
what
happened
next
im
a
student
of
human
phychology
particularly
in
the
area
of
psyops
because
ive
found
some
of
the
techniques
to
be
useful
in
business
negotiations
that
puts
me
firmly
in
the
amateur
ranks
this
amateur
knows
that
the
first
thing
to
do
when
sizing
up
the
opponent
is
to
do
a
psychological
profile
on
him
you
can
bet
your
ass
the
fbi
had
professionally
done
profiles
on
koresh
koreshs
behavior
was
emminently
predictable
it
is
typical
of
people
who
move
away
from
civilization
to
be
willing
to
fight
to
the
death
to
preserve
their
isolation
it
would
also
be
typical
given
koreshs
religious
orientation
for
such
an
individual
to
interpret
a
government
assault
as
the
apocalypse
suicide
is
as
an
acceptable
alternative
to
being
consumed
in
the
apocalypse
imho
the
fbi
knew
all
this
and
decided
after
days
of
concentrated
psyops
to
initiate
that
apocalypse
i
believe
they
chose
a
course
of
action
designed
specifically
to
push
koresh
over
the
edge
while
publicly
appearing
to
be
acting
reasonably
they
knew
that
koresh
considered
the
tanks
to
be
the
chariots
of
fire
mentioned
in
the
book
of
revelations
they
knew
that
sending
tanks
oops
combat
engineering
vehicles
obstensibly
to
perform
gas
insertions
love
that
newspeak
would
push
him
over
the
edge
look
at
some
supporting
evidence
koreshs
attorney
mentioned
on
tv
earlier
today
that
one
of
koreshs
major
concern
was
the
biblical
role
of
the
tanks
stationed
around
the
compound
the
fbi
through
reno
on
larry
king
last
night
and
at
the
news
conference
this
morning
claimed
to
have
listening
devices
in
the
compound
if
that
was
true
they
knew
their
actions
were
driving
him
to
the
brink
they
knew
they
were
pushing
the
davidians
toward
mass
suicide
any
rational
and
reasonable
agency
not
interested
in
killing
those
people
would
at
the
first
sign
of
preparations
for
suicide
have
pulled
completely
back
and
would
have
gotten
rid
of
all
the
armor
instead
they
continued
with
the
gas
insertion
right
up
to
the
point
where
flames
appeared
the
image
that
will
remain
etched
in
my
mind
is
that
of
the
tank
strutting
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
burning
compound
gloating
over
the
kill
lets
step
back
and
assess
how
this
thing
could
have
been
ended
without
bloodshed
this
technique
would
have
required
a
law
enforcement
agency
interested
in
constitutionally
enforcing
the
law
and
in
the
preservation
of
life
instead
of
achieving
a
military
victory
and
of
vengence
the
way
to
have
nabbed
koresh
was
simply
to
have
announced
a
pull
back
abandoned
the
assault
torn
down
the
concertina
wire
and
removed
the
armor
maintained
covert
surveillance
of
the
compound
and
then
exploited
his
ego
to
flush
him
out
exploiting
his
ego
would
have
been
simple
a
simple
invite
or
two
from
the
tabloid
talk
shows
to
come
on
tv
and
tell
how
he
whipped
the
us
government
would
have
been
something
he
could
not
have
resisted
he
could
have
then
been
nabbed
when
he
left
the
compound
simple
clean
and
safe
but
because
it
would
have
required
the
fbi
to
execute
a
tactical
retreat
and
would
have
deprived
them
of
the
revenge
they
sought
it
was
totally
out
of
the

heres

koresh

his

were
basically
minding

some
weapons
violations
may
have
been
committed
and
i
wouldnt
have
disapproved
of
prosecuting
him
for
those
violations
however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children

other
noncombatants
i
dont

they
couldnt
just
leave
a
token
guard
on

wait
the

out
i
dont
approve
of
the
tear

approach
and
if
it
caused
the
fire
to
be
started
i
think
the
fbi
agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in

i
think
the
legal
term
would
be
negligent
homicide
however
if
koreshs
response
to
the
tear
gas
was
to
kill
everyone
there
i
hold
him
largely
responsible

their
deaths

here

to
david

dem
co
before
anybody
says
something
yes
the
letter
is
a
bit
sharp
in
tone
i
have
been
writting
reasonable
and
polite
letters
to
him
for
years
and
all
i
get
in
return
in

since
he
already
is

f

i
dont
think
that
upsetting
him
will
harm

sorry
if
you
disagree
but
recent
events
in
texas
really
have
me
pissed
april
representative
skaggs
recently
i
wrote
to
you
regarding
my
outrage
over
the
tactics
used
by
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
batf
in
texas
in
your
response
you
stated
that
events
in
texas
underscore
the
need
for
stricter
gun
control
legislation
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hand
of
groups
such
as
the
branch
davidians
my
question
to
you
is
what
grounds
would
you
use
to
deny
them
access
to
firearms
best
i
can
tell
this
statement
underscores
your
apparent
total
ignorance
of
the
subject
and
highlights
your
personal
bias
against
firearms
i
say
this
because
there
are
only
two
possible
paths
of
gun
control
which
you
could
have
been
referencing
either
you
were
talking
about
their
access
to
semiautomatics
firearms
in
this
case
i
should
point
out
that
semiautomatic
firearms
are
legal
in
most
areas
of
this
country
including
texas
and
colorado
in
addition
the
members
of
the
cult
have
never
been
convicted
of
any
crimes
which
would
deny
them
the
ability
to
purchase
these
weapons
so
under
what
grounds
would
you
deny
them
these
guns
their
religion
the
fact
they
they
live
in
a
large
group
alone
by
themselves
because
you
consider
them
to
be
a
cult
maybe
i
consider
your
church
to
be
a
cult
this
line
of
reasoning
by
you
borders
on
the
concept
of
thought
crimes
you
and
pat
robertson
should
really
get
along
you
were
referring
to
the
alleged
fully
automatic
weapons
possessed
by
the
cult
under
current
us
law
fully
automatic
weapons
have
been
covered
by
some
of
the
strictest
gun
control

in

so
if
david

illegally
possessed
them
he
would
have
had

we
have
how
will
more

help
by
the
way
it
has
been
reported
that
david
koresh
possessed
a

which
would
have
permitted
him
to
possess

if
true
the
people
who
perished
monday
in

died
so
that
the

could

hundred

david

have
heard
claims

and
the

randy

trial
update
day
monday
april
was
the
fifth
day
of
the
trial
synopsis
government
informant
kenneth
fadeley
testified
that
randy
weaver
sold
him
two
shotguns
in
violation
of
the
national
firearms
act
of
us
district
court
judge
edward
lodge
asks
jurors
not
to
hear
accounts
of
the
waco
fire
because
of
possible
influences
on
the
weaverharris
case
the
testimony
of
fbi
special
agent
greg
rampton
apparently
ended
without
further
incident
as
it
was
mentioned
neither
by
ktvb
nor
the
idaho
statesman
the
day
was
highlighted
by
the
testimony
of
kenneth
fadeley
who
had
been
posing
as
an
outlaw
biker
and
illegal
guns
person
named
gus
magiosono
fadeley
testified
that
he
was
acting
as
an
informant
for
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
in
his
dealings
with
randy
weaver
fadeley
began
by
stating
that
he
had
met
weaver
in
at
an
aryan
nations
summer
conference
in
hayden
lake
idaho
the
two
then
met
again
october
note
the
huge
separation
in
time
at
a
restaurant
in
sandpoint
idaho
to
begin
a
weapons
transaction
he
stated
that
weaver
had
said
he
felt
like
he
weaver
was
being
prepared
to
do
something
dangerous
for
the
white
cause
the
two
later
met
october
behind
the
restaurant
and
later
went
to
a
city
park
to
make
the
sale
during
this
second
meeting
fadeley
was
wearing
a
small
recording
device
to
tape
the
conversation
weaver
allegedly
showed
him
an
hr
gauge
shotgun
with
a
barrel
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
he
additionally
showed
a
remington
shotgun
with
a
barrel
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
nfa
requires
minimums
of
inches
for
barrel
length
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
on
tape
weaver
is
reported
to
have
said
that
he
could
perform
better
work
once
his
machine
shop
is
set
up
the
two
then
discuss
the
possibility
of
future
sales
fadeley
then
counts
out
three
hundred
dollars
for
the
two
guns
and
promises
the
balance
of
onehundred
fifty
dollars
when
they
next
meet
note
that
the
atf
could
have
simply
arrested
him
here
why
did
they
wait
until
january
over
a
year
later
to
arrest
him
this
is
not
explained
the
next
meeting
took
place
on
nov
fadeley
stated
that
his
source
had
only
come
up
with
one
hundred
dollars
instead
of
the
onehundred
fifty
hed
promised
at
this
point
weaver
suspected
he
was
dealing
with
an
informant
i
had
a
guy
in
spokane
tell
me
you
were
bad
fadeley
managed
to
convince
weaver
otherwise
the
idaho
statesman
states
explicitly
that
three
tapes
were
made
of
conversations
with
randy
weaver
thus
each
of
these
meetings
must
have
been
recorded
however
the
statesman
also
reported
that
a
tape
of
a
telephone
conversation
involving
vicki
weaver
randy
weavers
wife
was
played
to
the
court
there
must
have
also
been
phone
taps
these
tapes
were
played
to
the
court
via
both
headphones
and
loudspeakers
under
the
objections
of
gerry
spence
weavers
attorney
spence
said
to
a
ktvb
reporter
that
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
government
proved
its
case
if
it
has
a
case
at
all
according
to
the
rules
randy
weaver
tore
off
his
headphones
and
wept
when
he
heard
his
wifes
voice
on
the
tape
us
district
court
judge
edward
lodge
asked
jurors
not
to
hear
accounts
of
the
waco
fire
because
of
possible
influences
on
the
weaverharris
case
exactly
how
such
information
could
affect
this
trial
is
not
explained
other
notes
sunday
evening
there
was
a
report
on
ktvb
concerning
kevin
harris
unnamed
agents
within
the
fbi
admit
that
they
are
surprised
that
kevin
harris
is
still
alive
first
they
were
surprised
that
he
survived
the
initial
gunshot
wounds
sustained
in
the
initial
firefight
at
the
yjunction
later
when
randy
weaver
was
struck
by
sniper
fire
the
sniper
had
reported
that
harris
had
been
struck
not
weaver
finally
there
was
a
report
that
the
fbi
agent
who
killed
vicki
weaver
believed
he
was
aiming
at
kevin
harris
instead
this
is
what
was
reported
critics
are
charging
that
the
fbi
was
blatantly
trying
to
eliminate
the
only
nongovernment
witness
to
the
deaths
of
samuel
weaver
and
deputy
marshal
william

some
local
people
believe
that
harriss
survival
is
simply
due

the

that
two
of

who
escaped
said
the

since
the

we

absolutely
no

of
any
of
the

claims
in
this
matter
moreover
the
batf
has
admitted
having
agents
in
the
compound
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
those
agents
were
still
in
the
compound
when
the
first
shots
were
fired
for
all
we

these

stay
around

assuming
the
two

in

were
even
in
the

at
all
maybe
i
sound
paranoid
but
i
watched
janet
reno
last
night
harping
on
how
much
david
koresh
was
a
big
bad
child
abuser
and
i
kept
wondering
why
she
much
less
batf
wanted
us
to
infer
that
she
had
any
jurisdiction
over
such

incompetent

the
siege
at

started
the
fbi
spokesman
has
been
stressing
how
unstable

paranoid
david

was
he
stressed
how
likely
it
was
the
the
branch
davidians
would
commit
mass
suicide
he
was
concerned
with
the
safety
of
the

what
did
the

do
to
defuse
the
situation
did
they
try
to
reassure
koresh
did
the
fbi
offer
medical
assistance
to
the
bd
did
the
fbi
offer
them
a
supply
of
water
when
the
bd
pump
stoped
working
did
the
permit
koresh
to
communicate
with
anyone
outside
the
compound
what
the
fbi
did
was
harass
the
branch
davidians
as
much
as
possible
they
kept
powerful
lights
shining
on
the
compound
shut
off
their
electrical
power
put
their
pump
out
of
action
assaulted
their
ears
with
loud
noise
cut
off
their
communication
with
the
outside
and
kept
limiting
their
permitter
the
stated
goal
was
to
put
pressure
on
david
koresh
was
the
fbi
attempting
to
get
koresh
to
surrender
or
were
they
hoping
to
get
koresh
so
mad
that
he
and
some

followers
would
attack
the
the

it
appears
that
the
tactics
employed
by

did
drive

the

should
be

tactics
drove

the

pumped

after
this

the
whole
thing
went
up
all
buildings
are
aflame
no
one
has
escaped
i
think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
napalm
then
let
the
wood
stove
inside
ignite
it
actually
if
a

translates

you
have

you
and
i

your

agency
cnn
failed

ah
freeman
seems
to
forget
from
my

that
i
am
learning
i
have
also
asked
several
of
the
notsohostile
folks
on
this
group
for
sources
of
information
to
read
do
you
think
freeman
that
maybe
this
means
i
am
interested
in
learning
i
think
it
does
because
as
you
said
people
who
dont
know
anything
wont
be
good
for
the
progun
cause
another
good
habit
to
get
into
is
to
go
readonly
for
a
while
to
take
the
time
to
figure
out
how
things
work
another
good
habit
to
get
into
is
to
realize
that
not
everyone
is
you
freeman
and
accept
mistakes
sure
maybe
it
could
have
been
some
type
of
misinformation
being
slung
by
some
antigun
nut
but
it
wasnt
i
made
my
statement
to
inform
everyone
of
this
and
everyone
who
replied
said
dont
worry
about
it
but
also
to
learn
as
much
as
you
can
they
accepted
my
mistake
and
gave
me
sources
of
information
and
told
me
to
read
as
much
as
possible
i
have
read
several
posts
of
yours
and
have
found
them
informative
why
dont
you
give
me
the
same
chance

i
replied
on
the

level
of

to
an
australian

made
in

before

koresh

believed
he
was

koresh
had

men
in

these
were
the
perfect

there
was
no

the

meant
to
address
who
might
be
unstable
enough
to
keep

in

with
tear

fbi

have

psychological
examinations

checks
plus
those
in

will
undoubtedly
have

in

to

why
would
the

want
to
fulfill

and
nevertheless
they
hit
all
their
marks

read
all
the

well
it

maybe
thoreau
had
a
clue
when
he
said
it
is
impossible
to
make
anything
foolproof
because
fools
are
so
ingenious
i
agree
that
the
batf
handled
the
affair
badly
two
of
the
nine
who
escaped
the
compound
said
the
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
cult
members
correction
the
fbi
said
that
two
of
the
cult
members
said
this
so
far
no
one
else
has
been

so

they

really

a

why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr

house
sometimes
this
works
sometimes

heres
a
story
that
some
of
you
may
find
amusing
its
a
story
about
arizona
househunting
from
leslie
fish
musician
and
author
one
of
the
reasons
im
planning
to
move
to
arizona
is
that
despite
its
lousy
economy
race
problems
simmering
religious
problems
and
hopelessly
bad
government
arizona
has
one
of
the
lowest
violent
crime
rates
in
the
country
is
it
just
coincidence
that
arizona
is
also
one
of
the
few
remaining
nogun
control
states
in
the
country
well
consider
this
funny
story
last
time
i
was
in
phoenix
staying
with
liz
burnham
i
did
some
checking
on
the
local
realestate
market
thats
when
i
discovered
that
with
my
income
as
provable
by
my
tax
returns
i
can
qualify
for
every
lowincome
housing
loan
in
the
book
with
the
exception
of
va
and
i
came
across
an
astonishing
ad
in
the
local
marketpaper
it
offered
a
threebedroom
house
in
the
phoenix
area
for
are
you
ready
for
this
all
of
no
money
down
per
month
total
payments
christ
on
a
harleydavidson
i
called
up
the
realestate
office
making
this
offer
made
it
clear
that
i
was
only
checking
the
local
market
and
asked
about
that
house
were
the
walls
roof
and
foundation
structurally
sound
yes
were
the
plumbing
and
electrical
systems
functional
and
up
to
code
yes
did
the
airconditioning
system
an
absolute
necessity
in
phoenix
work
yes
again
okay
so
what
was
wrong
with
the
house
well
it
needed
lots
of
plastering
painting
yard
work
and
some
patching
of
the
roof
and
yes
lowinterest
repair
loans
were
available
okay
sez
i
if
thats
all
thats
wrong
with
it
just
why
are
you
selling
a
house
for
all
of
well
squirms
the
agent
its
in
kind
of
a
bad
neighborhood
how
bad
sez
i
remembering
some
of
the
neighborhoods
ive
seen
in
chicago
and
oakland
worst
in
the
city
the
agent
sighs
and
then
he
told
me
this
amazing
story
every
few
years
it
seems
the
big
vicegangs
in
los
angeles
notice
that
theres
no
gang
presence
in
phoenix
which
is
just
a
quick
drive
from
la
and
get
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
subsidiary
there
well
a
couple
years
ago
the
colonizing
force
came
to
this
neighborhood
it
being
poor
and
spanish
they
figured
they
could
move
right
in
and
take
over
bought
this
house
and
started
operations
unfortunately
for
them
the
neighbors
not
only
didnt
like
this
they
didnt
care
for
whores
trotting
up
and
down
their
streets
all
night
pimps
soliciting
their
kids
dope
deals
on
the
corners
in
broad
daylight
and
so
on
they
werent
afraid
to
do
something
about
it
the
neighbors
called
the
cops
for
some
reason
the
phoenix
police
are
remarkably
honest
capable
polite
and
prompt
and
the
cops
promptly
came
and
swept
up
all
the
whores
pimps
and
pushers
off
the
street
and
away
to
jail
the
remaining
gang
members
decided
to
retaliate
in
the
fashion
they
usually
use
in
la
they
got
the
complainants
name
and
address
off
the
court
records
and
did
a
driveby
shooting
at
his
house
well
this
wasnt
los
angeles
the
moment
the
neighbors
heard
the
first
gunshots
fired
they
all
ran
out
their
front
doors
with
their
own
guns
rifles
shotguns
pistols
everything
and
shot
back
the
car
didnt
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
block
it
coasted
to
a
stop
riddled
with
more
holes
than
the
famous
bonnie
and
clyde
getaway
car
which
ive
seen
its
on
display
in
a
casino
in
a
casino
in
las
vegas
the
gas
tank
and
fuel
lines
had
been
ruptured
so
the
car
caught
fire
the
neighbors
waited
a
good
minutes
making
sure
nobody
got
out
of
that
car
before
they
called
the
fire
department
to
come
put
out
the
fire
and
tow
the
wreck
away
by
that
time
the
asphalt
under
the
car
had
melted
and
caught
fire
too
which
subsequently
left
a
large
and
nasty
pothole
in
the
street
the
city
is
slow
about
repairing
small
streets
so
the
hole
stayed
there
providing
a
traffic
hazard
for
several
months
all
this
was
two
years
ago
the
agent
concluded
and
theres
been
no
trouble
since
but
the
house
and
the
neighborhood
still
have
a
bad
reputation
and
thats
why
the
house
was
so
cheap
hearing
this
story
i
nearly
laughed
my
ass
off
i
told
the
agent
that
if
i
had
the
money
at
the
moment
id
bygod
buy
the
house
this
was
nothing
compared
to
bad
neighborhoods
id
seen
here
in
california
where
driveby
shootings
go
unchecked
by
the
wellarmed
cops
let
alone
by
the
unarmed
neighbors
if
thats
the
absolute
worst
youll
find
in
phoenix
then
thats
the
city
for
me
thats
the
difference
that
an
armed
civilian
population
makes
think
about
it

will
not

soon
enough

them
resistance

they

one

your

they
will
consider
you
more

if

yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
it
certainly
is
provable
around
a
million
americans
every
year
defend
themselves
with
firearms
in
many
of
these
cases
the
defender
doesnt
even
have
to
fire
a
shot
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
is
oftentimes
all
the
deterrent
that
is
needed
i
dont
like
violence
anymore
than
anyone
else
does
but
taking
away
the
right
of
americans
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
not
the
solution
to
the
violent
crime
problem
in
this
country
if
honest
lawabiding
citizens
are
unable
to
get
firearms
then
they
will
be
preyed
on
even
more
by
criminals
who
will
be
able
to
acquire
guns
through
illegal
channels
expect
to
start
seeing
the
crime
syndicates
who
smuggle
drugs
into
this
country
start
smuggling
guns
believe
me
this
will
happen
there
is
plenty
of
economic
incentive
for
gangsters
to
illegaly
import
guns
into
this
country
if
guns
should
be
banned
by
the

the

humans
who

no

it
is

the

planned

the

heard
was
the
fbi
keeping

im
not

this

it
went
down

just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be

today
my

bleeds

were

my

also

not

the

leave

came

my

you
are
the
bleeding

and
im
sure
beyond
any

doubt
that
you
do
not

you
can

you

do

this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very

then
they
got
what

something
strikes
me
as
odd
among

prorkba
arguments
presented
here
the
numbers
comparing
hundreds
of
thousands
indeed
even
a
million
of
instances

abiding

deterring
criminal

seem
valid

me
likewise
the
number

homicides
each

about
however
it
is
surprising
that
the
evil
antigun

darth

breathing

here
never
tries
to
compare
all
legitimate
gun
defenses
vs
all

crimes
instead
its
always
all
legitimate

defenses
which
includes
cases
in
which
the
criminals
are
shot
but
not
killed
and
cases
in
which
the
criminal
is
not
here
vs
just
criminal
gun
homicides
which
only
includes

which
the

why
is
this
of

it
wouldnt
be

to
say
that
in
each
crime
already
measured
involving
guns
the
consequnces
are
already
known

it
is
safe
to
assume
that
a

bank
robbery
last

will
not
suddenly
turn
into
a

whereas
in
the

may

then
were

you

you

do
you

not
so
as
far
as
the

are

it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
i
dont
know
about
you

i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
that
is
the
recommended
way
to
practice
with
a
ccw
too
aim
alone
is
no
good
for

all
i

i

when

long

another
part

was
that
while

some
were

based
on
what
i

you

that

those

still
ludicrous
however
previously
awesley
had

you
can
also
read
of

prompting
me
to

to
fire
fragmentary

i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear

certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let

wouldnt

awesley

john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel

so
you
have
to
stretch
what

and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
but
why
did
you
mention
grenade
launchers
at
all

it
supports
the
notion
that
the
tanks
shelled
buildings
and
it
supports

conjures

authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
yes
if
it
happened
i
would
have
heard
about
it
everybody
would
have
army
tanks
dont
fire
their
cannons
in
american
cities
in
the
without
it
becoming
common
knowledge
without
minority
leaders
seizing
on
it
and
condemning
it
over
and
over
again
without
civil
libertarians
saying
this
has
gone
far
enough
so
yes
my
never
hearing
of
it
was
the
basis
for
my
disbelieving
the
claim
now
i
have
more
reasons
to
disbelieve
it
not
one
poster
has
written
to
say
yes
i
lived
in
detroit
at
that
time
and
everybody
knew
that
the
tanks
had
fired
shells
this
is
the
usenet
if
it
had
happened
somebody
here
would
remember
it
furthermore
your
own
research
failed
to
come
up
with
any
support
for
the
claim
the
claim
is
extraordinary
and
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
extraordinary
or
not
unless
you
count
the
brags
of
a
couple
of
guardsmen
shooting
the
shit
i
do
not
i
wrote
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
awesley
wrote
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
quibble
fine
it
was
an
army
coverup
six
years
in
the
reserves
has
taught
me
the
difference
also
but
do
you
think
that
in
two
and
half
decades
not
one
guiltridden
participant
has
come
forward
and
said
yes
i
shelled
americans
or
i
gave
the
orders
to
fire
the
cannons
or
i
helped
cover
it
up
i
wrote
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
awesley
replied
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
did
fire
their
guns
good
then
we
can
drop
the
junk
about
you
not
claiming
that
they
did
your

i

something
strikes
me
as
odd
among

prorkba
arguments
presented
here
the
numbers
comparing
hundreds
of
thousands
indeed
even
a
million
of
instances
of

deterring
criminal

seem
valid
to
me
likewise
the

each

about
however
it
is
surprising
that
the

here
never
tries
to
compare
all
legitimate

defenses
vs
all
gun
crimes
instead
its
always
all
legitimate
gun
defenses
which
includes
cases
in
which
the
criminals
are
shot
but
not
killed
and
cases
in
which
the

is

vs

criminal

which
only
includes

which

why
is
this

it
wouldnt
be
unreasonable
to
say
that
in
each
crime
already
measured
involving
guns
the
consequnces
are
already
known
and
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
a
gunbased
bank
robbery
last
week
will
not
suddenly
turn
into
a
gunbasd
robberyhomicide
whereas
in
the
legitimate
gun
defenses
one
may
assume
that
all
those
criminals
who
were
deterred
would
have
committed
more
crime
or
more
serious
crimes
had
they
not
been
deterred
i
think
its
an
attempt
to
show
livessaved

all

gun

crimes
dont
result
in

on
the
other
hand
its
impossible
to
know
how
many
of
the
successful
self
defenses
prevented
lives
from
being
lost
in
other
words
the
liveslost
is
pretty
clear
its
the
homicide
and
non
negligent
manslaughter
number
while
the
lives
saved
is
some
percentage
of
the

clearly
that

charles
scripter
writes
this
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
is
what
confuses
me
according
to
the
federalist
papers
a
well
regulated
militia
has
a
well
defined
structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
perhaps
you
should
reread
federal
which
deals
exclusively
with
the
well
regulated
malitia
here
is
what
is
says
about
its
character
to
oblige
the
great
body
of
the
yeomanry
and
of
the
other
classes
of
the
citizens
to
be
under
arms
for
the
purpose
of
going
through
military
exercises
and
evolutions
as
often
as
might
be
necessary
to
acquire
the
degree
of
perfection
which
would
entitle
them
to
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
it
also
talks
about
the
well
regulated
militia
having
a
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
i
will
note
you
did
quote
the
end
of
this
particular
paragraph
which
states
little
more
can
reasonably
be
aimed
at
with
respect
to
the
people
at
large
than
to
have
them
properly
armed
and
equipped
and
in
order
to
see
that
this
be
not
neglected
it
will
be
necessary
to
assemble
them
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
a
year
but
do
you
knew
how
much
organization
is
required
to
training
a
large
group
of
poeple
twice
a
year
just
to
try
to
get
the
same
people
every
year
provide
a
basic
training
to
new
people
so
they
can
be
integrated
into
the
force
and
find
a
suitable
location
it
requires
a
continually
standing
committee
of
organizers
since
a
well
regulate
militia
is
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
and
meet
once
or
twice
a
year
to
train
how
can
you
claim
a
well
regulated
militia
is
not
well
organized
but
i
will
concide
a
well
organized
militia
is
not
necessarily
a
well
regulated
militia
several
people
have
stated
that
the
well
organized
militia
is
what
is
defined
under
usc
which
states
the
militia
of
the
united
states
consists
of
all
ablebodied
males
at
least
years
of
age
and
except
as
provided
in
section
of
title
under
years
of
age
who
are
or
who
have
made
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
female
citizents
of
the
united
states
who
are
commissioned
officers
of
the
national
guard
this
deos
define
the
militia
but
were
is
the
adjective
well
regulated
usc
does
not
define
a
well
regualed
militia
in
any
way
shape
or
form
it
only
defines
who
can
become
part
of
a
well
regulated
militia
the
federalist
papers
clearly
define
the
well
regualed
militia
as
a
proper
subset
of
the
militia
in
the
same
paragraph
quoted
above
it
talk
above
disciplining
all
the
militia
of
the
united
states
so
they
fit
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
this
is
what
the
paragraph
states
about
the
associated
costs
it
would
form
an
annual
deduction
from
the
productive
labor
of
the
country
to
an
amount
which
calculating
upon
the
present
numbers
of
the
people
would
not
fall
far
short
of
the
whole
expense
of
the
civil
establishments
of
all
the
states
to
attempt
a
thing
which
would
abridge
the
mass
of
labor
and
industry
to
so
considerable
an
extent
would
be
unwise
and
the
experiment
if
made
could
not
succeed
because
it
would
not
long
be
endured
another
quote
provide
by
charles
scripter
is
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
so
the
phrase
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
must
either
qualify
or
explain
the
phrase
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
definition
of
explain
as
stated
in
the
american
hertitage
dictionary
of
the
enlish
language
the
new
college
edition
is
to
make
plain
or
comprehensible
remove
obscruity
from
elucidate
it
was
the
economists
who
undertook
to
explain
this
puzzle
to
define
explicate
expound
he
explained
his
plan
to
offer
reasons
for
or
a
cause
of
an
answer
for
justify
explain
an
error
the
second
phrase
clearly
does
not
explain
the
first
therefore
the
second
phrase
must
qualify
the
first
the
definition
given
for
qualify
is
to
describe
by
enumerating
the
characteristics
or
qualities
of
characterize
to
make
competent
or
suitable
for
office
position
or
task
to
give
legal
power
to
make
legally
capable
to
modify
limit
or
restrict
as
giving
exceptions
to
make
less
harsh
or
severe
moderate
grammar
to
modify
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
phrase
since
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
does
not
describe
modify
or
make
less
harsh
anything
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
grammar
or
some
sort
of
position
or
task
by
process
of
elimination
it
must
fall
into
definition
and
since
deals
with
legal
power
the
same
thing
the
constitution
does
it
must
be
the
correct
definition
in
this
case
therefore
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
gives
legal
power
to
the
well
regualated
militia
and
this
legal
power
shall
not
be
infringed
i
thank
you
very
much
mr
scripter
you
have
provided
me
with
more
evidence
that
the
second
amendment
only
concerns
itseft
with
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulate
militia
and
says
very
little
about
the
right
of
an
untrained
person
to
keep
and
bear
a
caliber
machine
gun
and
since
i
totally
untrained
in
the
use
of
any
firearm
something
i
personly
have
meant
to
correct
by
going
to
a
nra
gun
safety
course
and
joining
a
gun
club
cannot
legally
buy
such
a
machine
gun
i
conclude
the
courts
and
democraticly
elected
congress
agree
with
me
so
now
we
know
which
category
mr
rutledge
is
in
he
means
to
destroy
our
liberties
and
rights
i
mean
to
destory
our
liberties
and
rights
is
that
why
a
participate
in
the
discussion
of
exactly
what
our
libertues
and

are
i
force
my
version
of
our
liberties
and
rights
by
begining
statements
of
what
our
liberties
and
rights
with
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
using
expressions
such
as
states
to
me
clearly
mean
i
intend
to
force
my
views
on

i
dont
think
so
so
in
effort
not
to
force
my
views
and
not
to
destory
our
liberties
and
rights
i
state
that
nothing
i
have
written
or
will
write
in
the
matter
of
liberties
and
rights
is
the
final

for
i

cases
such
as
us
v
miller
us
and
us
v
verdugourquidez
s
ct
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
amendment
protects
this
interpretation
can
be
found
as
far
back
as
the
dred
scott
case
in
its
worth
noting
that
us
vs
miller
sustained
millers
conviction
of
possession
of
an
illegal
firearm
noting
that
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
not
a
proper
militia
weapon
no
they
noted
that
no
one
had
claimed
that
it
was
a
proper
militia
weapon
despite
having
been
used
in
at
least
two
wars
this
was
true
since
neither
miller
nor
his
lawyer
appeared
before
the
court
did
they
or
did
they
not
sustain
millers
conviction
i
dont
have
the
text
of
the
case
handy
yes
shotguns
had
been
used
in
wwi
the
spanishamerican
war
and
the
us
civil
war
that
was
not
in
question
the
possession
of
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
ie
a
weapon
altered
to
improve
concealibility
therefore
us
vs
miller
supports
limited
government
regulation
of
firearms
dont
go
arguing
down
this
road
unless
you
are
willing
to
abide
by
the
consequences
that
you
find
at
the
end
of
it
mainly
that
the
lawabiding
common
man
has
a
right
to
own
any
weapon
that
has
a
militia
purpose
from
handguns
to
sawedoff
shotguns
and
fully
automatic
weapons
that
in
fact
is
what
this
decision
says
you
are
free
to
produce
evidence
that
im
not
willing

with
all

me
my

a

his

were
hiking
in

all
of
a
sudden
large
rocks
began
raining
down
on

up
we
saw
at

punks
gleefully
letting
loose
rocks
from
what
was
an
obvious
stash
they
were
a
couple
hundred
feet
above
us
meanwhile
the
women
and

were
screaming
and
running
for
cover
and
the
punks
were
shrieking
with
laughter
me
and
my

yelled
for
them
to
knock
it
off
they
responded
that
we
should
get
fed
me
and
my

drew
our
pistols
and
fired
a
couple
of
times

the

above
their

they
ran
with
no

rocks
coming
at

we
proceeded

me

saw

questions
a
couple
of
questions
for
you
firearms
law
experts
out
there
question
according
to
the
nraila
state
firearms
lawbook
in
wisconsin
it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
except
a
peace
officer
to
go
armed
with
a
concealed
and
dangerous
weapon
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
obtaining
a
lixense
or
permit
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
jury
instructions
indicate
that
to
go
armed
one
must
have
a
firearm
on
ones
person
or
within
his
immediate
control
and
available
for
use
does
this
mean
that
open
carry
is
allowed
if
so
just
how
open
does
it
have
to
be
would
an
in
the
pants
holster
be
considered
concealing
what
if
one
had
their
jacket
on
and
it
partially
covered
the
weapon
also
is
there
any
way
to
be
allowed
to
carry
concealed
or
is
it
just
not
allowed
period
question
as
i
understand
it
in
evanston
il
they
have
a
ordinance
banning
handguns
is
there
any
way
to
get
around
this
provision
what
would
the
penalty
if
you
were
found
out
be
what
if
you
used
said
handgun
in
a
defensive
shooting
in
your
apartment
there
how
would
the
city
law
apply
to
your
impending
trial
for
the
shooting
also
what
is
il
state
law
concerning
short
barreled
weapons
short
barreled
shotgun
is
what
i
would
be
interested
in
if
a
handgun
were
not
available
either
that
or
a
shortened
carbine
ie
colt
marlin
one
more
thing
what
is
the
chance
of
getting
a
ccw
permit
in
il
without
being
rich
or
famous
or
related
to
the
mayor
please
send
replies
via

as
things
seem
to
be
piling
up
around
tpg

little
faster

they

out
a

justifications
produced
by
the

after
months
of
investigation
for
their

i
couldnt
believe
the
junk
on
this

for

the

were
accused
of
stockpiling
a

of

ammunition
that
can

imagine

they
also
had

its

so

i
havent
heard
that
its

the

thing
on

that

was

no

just
to
shed
some
light
on
the
fire
it
was
widely
reported
ap
etc
that
there
were
several
witnesses
to
bd
folks
starting
the
fires
it
has
also
been
reported
that
the
fires
broke
out
in
several
places
at
once
which
rules
out
a
bradley
knocking
over
a
lamp
etc
as
the
cause
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and

i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations

other
point
im
no

i
do
like
the
way

just
where
he

the
issue
subject
re
some
more
about
gun
control
first
i
would
like
to
say
how
much
i
appreciate
having
so
literate
and
erudite
an
individual
as
mr
rutledge
with
whom
to
discuss
this
topic
frankly
most
antirkba
posters
refuse
even
to
approach
the
topic
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
detailed
in
the
writings
of
the
era
this
is
most
refreshing
second
i
must
apologize
for
leaving
the
discussion
for
several
days
my
brigades
quarterly
drill
was
this
weekend
and
i
needed
to
attend
to
several
matters
pertaining
to
the
state
militia
some
people
seem
to
feel
that
the
concept
of
the
militia
is
an
anachro
nism
that
is
out
of
place
in
the
century
im
not
sure
the
swiss
would
agree
and
i
think
perhaps
a
discussion
of
how
the
militia
both
organized
and
unorganized
fits
into
the
defense
plans
of
my
state
mississippi
please
do
not
assume
that
this
describes
something
peculiar
to
one
southern
state
for
instance
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
a
well
organized
militia
which
members
report
maintains
stocks
of
both
riot
guns
and
machine
guns
the
laws
of
other
states
will
vary
but
are
probably
similar
title
of
mississippi
code
defines
our
militia
as
all
ablebodied
citizens
of
the
state
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
sixty
two
years
the
militia
is
divided
into
classes
the
national
guard
the
mississippi
state
guard
and
the
unorganized
militia
the
national
guard
is
a
strange
sort
of
fish
from
a
constitutional
perspective
it
tries
to
be
both
state
militia
and
federal
reserve
the
discussion
of
this
paraconstitutional
arrangement
is
quite
interesting
in
itself
but
somewhat
beyond
the
scope
of
this
discussion
suffice
it
that
at
this
date
the
national
guard
has
ceased
to
have
any
constitutional
standing
as
anything
but
a
federal
reserve
force
mississippi
and
most
other
states
maintains
a
purely
state
organized
militia
in
mississippi
this
is
called
the
state
guard
in
other
states
it
may
be
called
something
else
the
state
guard
exists
as
a
cadre
or
training
corps
made
up
of
mostly
experienced
officers
and
senior
ncos
who
serve
as
volunteers
without
compensation
we
drill
on
a
monthly
basis
at
the
company
and
battalion
level
brigade
once
a
quarter
and
have
an
annual
drill
of
the
whole
organization
our
stateauthorized
cadre
strength
is
this
is
a
skeleton
of
an
organization
without
any
flesh
the
muscle
and
sinew
when
needed
will
come
from
the
unorganized
militia
in
time
of
invasion
insurrection
or
calamity
the
governor
can
order
the
activation
of
the
state
guard
when
this
takes
place
a
call
will
first
be
made
for
volunteers
to
fill
the
organization
out
to
either
its
contingency
strength
of
or
full
strength
of
in
the
event
that
a
sufficient
number
of
people
fail
to
volunteer
the
law
provides
detailed
instructions
for
the
conducting
of
a
draft
of
the
unorganized
militia
the
size
of
the
state
guard
is
not
specified
by
law
but
rather
by
executive
order
at
one
time
the
organized
militia
of
mississippi
consisted
of
regiments
needless
to
say
the
state
does
not
have
armories
brimming
with
weapons
with
which
to
equip
such
a
force
the
historical
precedent
for
arming
such
a
force
is
by
use
of
mostly
the
private
arms
of
the
militiamen
it
is
my
hope
that
demonstrates
that
state
militias
are
far
from
being
the
long
dead
anachronisms
that
some
may
wish
to
claim
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
and
i
have
also
stated
that
a
militia
that
meets
once
or
twice
a
year
is
clearly
well
organized
and
this
state
of
readiness
that
i
have
claimed
the
people
have
a
right
to
is
the
same
state
of
readiness
expected
of
the
militia
as
stated
by
hamilton
regarding
hamilton
if
you
take
hamiltons
opinion
as
being
the
sole
representative
of
the
opinions
of
the
founding
fathers
you
will
have
chosen
a
highly
skewed
sample
set
hamilton
was
on
the
extreme
federalist
end
of
the
political
spectrum
others
such
as
coxe
and
henry
can
be
chosen
to
represent
the
other
end
many
contemporaries
felt
that
the
idea
of
having
a
standing
army
of
any
sort
or
even
a
select
militia
or
train
bands
were
contrary
to
the
egalitarian
nature
of
the
govern
ment
they
were
striving
to
perfect
the
compromise
reached
was
to
provide
for
a
small
army
which
had
to
be
refinanced
every
two
years
and
ironclad
protection
for
the
militia
which
was
to
remain
ever
terrible
and
irresistible
these
protections
included
state
control
not
federal
limitation
of
federal
utilization
of
the
militia
ie
execute
laws
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasions
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
prevent
what
the
british
had
tried
to
do
at
lexington
these
limitations
eventually
proved
so
onerous
to
the
federal
govern
ment
that
they
were
skirted
by
the
creation
of
the
national
guard
the
national
guard
was
created
for
one
very
simple
reason
the
constitutional
militia
was
had
proved
too
unreliable
for
fighting
wars
of
imperial
expansion
eg
spanishamerican
war
the
constitution
provided
that
the
militia
could
only
be
employed
by
the
federal
government
in
very
limited
purposes
as
far
back
as
the
war
of
militia
units
had
refused
to
leave
united
states
territory
to
attack
the
enemy
further
there
was
no
constitutional
authorization
for
any
conscription
of
anyone
into
the
federal
military
and
militiamen
were
particularly
protected
in
all
wars
until
wwi
every
american
who
left
the
country
under
arms
was
a
volunteer
when
the
national
guard
acts
of
required
that
each
new
member
also
enlist
as
a
reservest
in
the
army
existing
soldiers
were
grandfathered
at
least
one
of
these
grandfathered
individuals
refused
to
go
to
france
in
and
his
refusal
was
upheld
by
the
federal
courts
mr
rutledge
has
stated
that
the
second
amendment
applies
only
to
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
however
the
preconstitutional
history
of
the
american
militia
shows
relatively
few
periods
when
the
militia
came
close
to
meeting
either
messrs
rutledge
or
hamiltons
definition
of
well
organized
in
the
period
of
peace
between
the
french
indian
war
and
the
revolution
many
companies
simply
stopped
drilling
and
had
to
be
reconstituted
just
prior
to
the
revolution
perhaps
mr
rutledge
would
care
to
argue
that
those
of
my
ancestors
who
answered
the
lexington
alarm
had
forfeited
their
rights
because
their
units
didnt
drill
for
a
few
years
in
the
i
would
not
be
so
bold
again
i
wish
to
repeat
the
national
guard
for
all
its
merits
is
not
the
militia
described
by
the
constitution
nor
by
mr
hamilton
nor
by
mr
henry
nor
by
mr
coxe
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
and
many
states
are
delinquent
in
their
attentions
to
and
organizing
of
their
constitutional
militias
diminishes
neither
their
responsibilities
nor
the
rights
of
the
militia
as
detailed
in
the
constitution
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
militia
is
but
one
error
that
has
crept
into
modern
readings
of
the
constitution
the
constitution
prohibits
states
from
keeping
troops
or
ships
of
war
in
time
of
peace
i
have
heard
some
insist
this
prevents
states
from
maintaining
a
militia
but
this
comes
about
because
people
today
do
not
understand
the
meanings
of
the
words
in
their
century
usage
today
we
call
any
large
vessel
a
ship
but
in
the
century
the
word
described
a
particular
kind
of
vessel
a
ship
is
a
large
vessel
with
three
or
more
masts
each
carrying
square
rigged
sails
a
brig
has
two
masts
in
the
contemporary
usage
the
states
were
prohibited
only
from
keeping
the
largest
warships
of
the
day
those
capable
of
global
operations
todays
equivalent
might
be
a
prohibition
on
the
states
keeping
nuclear
missiles
troops
at
this
time
meant
a
fulltime
professional
military
organization
any
study
of
contemporaneous
writings
will
bear
this
out
in
at
least
one
respect
i
am
in
agreement
with
mr
rutledge
being
personally
involved
in
the
maintenance
and
advancement
of
the
militia
as
a
viable
means
of
defense
for
a
modern
society
i
am
frequently
both
bemused
and
saddened
when
friends
and
associates
wax
poetic
on
their
place
in
the
unorganized
militia
and
become
strangely
silent
or
scarce

he
was

there
is
no
sane

that

can

show

thanks
for
my

of

definitely
a
very
silly
supposition
you
should
at

view
the
whole
documentary
before
you
claim
it
as
a
source
i
would
if
i
could
the
news
show
that
showed
the
lengthy
excerpts
also
had
interviews
with
the
filmmaker
who
made
the
documentary
who
basically
confirmed
what
was
shown
in
the
excerpts
from
the
time
he
spent
at
the
compound
in
i
am
not
pleased
with
the
batf
handling
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungled
it
badly
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
responsible
for
the
fire
which
started
in
two
different
places
two
places
eh
you
saw
this
or
did
the
wonderful
fbi
tell
you
this
i
saw
one
place
i
believe
that
this
was
reported
by
local
radio
reporters
on
site
a
fire
started
in
a
three
story
tower
at
the
same
time
as
the
two
story
window
shown
on
the
tv
coverage
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenty
of
camerapeople
willing
to
risk
small
arms
fire
to
get
some
good
footage
these
people
were
told
to
get
the
hell
out
of
camera
range
why
couldnt
answer
this
one
eh
this
is
the
most
important
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
cause
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mentioning
how
reagan
and
the
military
treated
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
precedent
but
decided
it
wasnt
worthy
of
discussion
if
the
news
reporter
got
shot
you
can
bet
his
family
would
sue
the
government
for
letting
him
into
the
danger
area
the
root
cause
of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
why
people
wouldnt
flee
a
building
that
had
numerous
exits
during
the
minutes
time
it
took
to
burn
down
or
why
didnt
they
flee
hours
earlier
when
the
tear
gas
was
first
introduced

can
find
no
rational
explanation

their

you
are
a
government
sucking
heartless
bastard
unworthy
of

but
apparently
true
my
opinion
only
of

so
your
opinion
is
truth
i
see
humans
died
yesterday
humans
who
would
not
have
died
if
the
fbi
had
not
taken
the
actions
they
did
that
is
the
undeniable
truth
i
cried
for
them
nor
would
they
have
died
if
they
had
come
out
with
their
hands
empty
that
is
undeniable
truth
no
it
is
not
it
is
possible
the
fbi
planned
for
this
to
happen
and
the
gunfire
heard
was
the
fbi
keeping
the
folks
inside
im
not
proposing
this
as
the
way
it
went
down
but
just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be
alive
today
you
can
believe
that
if
you
wish
it
is
undeniable
however
that
people
have
left
the
compound
unharmed
and
alive
earier
in
the
standoff
and
since
their
leader
was
preaching
that
they
would
have
an
apocalypse
you
can
not
say
undeniably
that
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
mass
suicide
if
the
fbi
had
simply
stayed
outside
and
waited
another
days
my
heart
bleeds
just
as
much
as
yours
for
the
children
who
were
never
released
given
days
of
ample
opportunities
to
do
so
my
heart
also
bleeds
for
people
so
blinded
by
religious
devotion
to
not
have
the
common
sense
to
leave
the
compound
when
tanks
came
up
and
started
dropping
in
tear
gas
early
in
the
morning
my
heart
bleeds
for
no
one
you
are
the
bleeding
heart
and
im
sure
beyond
any
possible
doubt
that
you
do
not
feel
for
those
people
as
i
do
you
can
not
say
the
heartless
things
you
have
said
if
you
did
i
am
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
you
are
not
making
sense
you
seem
to
have
no
concern
that
someone
would
keep
children
inside
this
compound
when
they
had
days
to
let
them
out
that
sounds
pretty
heartless
to
me
i
just
heard
on
the
news
that
some
of
the
survivors
regret
they
hadnt
stayed
in
the
inferno
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
koresh
this
makes
me
sad
and
sick
you
seem
to
say
they
got
what
they
deserved
i
do
not
think
this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very
quickly
then
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
put
into
motion
themselves
they
got
what
they
wanted
what
kind
of
creature
are
you
that
you
can
believe
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
jonestown
the
sad
thing
is
the
people
inside
the
compound
were
the
authority
worshipers
and
their
only
authority
was
koreshhowell
if
these
people
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
there
would
likely
be
a
lot
more
survivors
today
koresh
preached
a
fiery
apocalypse
as
early
as
last
year
i
see
the
batf
is
going
to
be
investigated
by
the
justice
dept
and
likely
by
arlen

and
congress
this
is
good
they
have
bungled

we
agree

this
now
lets
have

i

i
doubt
that

it

is
a

it

the

the
original
question
was
about
who
started
the
fire
and
whether
the
madmen
were
inside
or
outside
the
compound
to
which
i
replied
on
the
possible
sanity
level
of
those
inside
and
outside
was
that
your
argument
well
you
didnt
make
it
very
well
you
started
from
the
questionable
premise
that
the
fire
was
necessarily
an
act
of
insanity
rather
than
an
act
of
negligence
or
an
accident
recall
one
survivor
claims
that
the
fire
started
when
a
tank
knocked
over
a
kerosene
lamp
kind
of
makes
arguments
regarding
relative
sanity
somewhat
moot
no
and
another
survivor
claims
he
heard
someone
shouting
the
fires
started
odd
terminology
thats
what
one
says
when
you
know
a
fire
is
planned
not
when
one
occurs
by
accident
we
will
have
to
wait
and
see
what
the
evidence
shows
assuming
one
is
willing
to
believe
any
evidence
offered
by
the
distrustful
ones
according
to
an
australian
documentary
made
in
the
year
before
the

off
began
koresh
and
his
followers
all
believed
he
was

koresh
had
sex
with
children
and
women
married
to
other

in

these
were
the
perfect

from
the

not

i
believe
the
deadline
was
april
i
paid
my

there
was
no
reference
to
sex
or
religion
on
the
form
the
comments
above
and
below
were
meant
to
address
who
might
be
unstable
enough
to
keep
children
in
a
building
with
tear
gas
or
start
a
fire
nice
evasive
maneuver
mr
chekov
but
theyre
still
on
our
tail
let
me
ask
it
more
plainly
which
of
the
above
complaints
about
david
koreshs
religious
or
sexual
proclivities
justified
an
armed
raid
by
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
neither
again
i
was
merely
addressing
the
sanity
level
of
the
players
i
agree
that
the
batf
handled
the
affair
badly
from
day
one
btw
i
heard
on
the
news
today
that
the
affadavit
behind
the
noknock
warrant
was
unsealed
today
grenade
launcher
was
the
only
thing
on
the
list
that
i
found
unusual
two
of
the
nine
who
escaped
the
compound
said
the
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
cult
members
so
when
they
talk
to
the
news
reporters
directly
and
relate
the
same
details
will
you
believe
them
believe
them
i
wont
even
recognize
them
and
neither
will
anyone
else
who
doesnt
know
them
personally
do
you
believe
they
would
put
impostors
before
the
national
tv
cameras
its
not
entirely
farfetched
nobody
outside
the
compound
would
know
everybody
inside
the
compound
dont
forget
the
batf
admits
having
agents
inside
the
compound
in
any
case
ambitious
news
reporters
could
use
the
documentary
filmed
by
an
australian
in
on
the

grounds
to
help
identify

i
for
one
will
check
their
stories
for
consistency
with
what
i
learned
in
a
long
news
story
about
that
documentary
at
this
point
we

session
with

pm
edt
the
president
on
february
the
four
federal
agents
were
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry
and
ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at
risk
because
the
batf
operation
had
failed
to
meet
its
objective
a
standoff
ensued
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
then
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the
bureaus
efforts
were
ultimately
unavailing
because
the
individual
with
whom
they
were
dealing
david
koresh
was
dangerous
irrational
and
probably
insane
he
engaged
in
numerous
activities
which
violated
both
federal
law
and
common
standards
of
decency
he
was
moreover
responsible
for
the
deaths
and
injuries
which
occurred
during
the
action
against
the
compound
in
february
given
his
inclination
towards
violence
and
in
an
effort
to
protect
his
young
hostages
no
provocative
actions
were
taken
for
more
than
seven
weeks
by
federal
agents
against
the
compound
this
weekend
i
was
briefed
by
attorney
general
reno
on
an
operation
prepared
by
the
fbi
designed
to
increase
pressure
on
koresh
and
persuade
those
in
the
compound
to
surrender
peacefully
the
plan
included
a
decision
to
withhold
the
use
of
ammunition
even
in
the
face
of
fire
and
instead
to
use
tear
gas
that
would
not
cause
permanent
harm
to
health
but
would
it
was
hoped
force
the
people
in
the
compound
to
come
outside
and
to
surrender
i
was
informed
of
the
plan
to
end
the
siege
i
discussed
it
with
attorney
general
reno
i
asked
the
questions
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
i
then
told
her
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
and
i
take
full
responsibility
for
the
implementation
of
the
decision
yesterdays
action
ended
in
a
horrible
human
tragedy
mr
koreshs
response
to
the
demands
for
his
surrender
by
federal
agents
was
to
destroy
himself
and
murder
the
children
who
were
his
captives
as
well
as
all
the
other
people
who
were
there
who
did
not
survive
he
killed
those
he
controlled
and
he
bears
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
carnage
that
ensued
now
we
must
review
the
past
with
an
eye
towards
the
future
i
have
directed
the
united
stated
departments
of
justice
and
treasury
to
undertake
a
vigorous
and
thorough
investigation
to
uncover
what
happened
and
why
and
whether
anything
could
have
been
dne
differently
i
have
told
the
departments
to
involve
independent
professional
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
investigation
i
expect
to
receive
analysis
and
answers
in
whatever
time
is
required
to
complete
the
review
finally
i
have
directed
the
departments
to
cooperate
fully
with
all
congressional
inquiries
so
that
we
can
continue
to
be
fully
accountable
to
the
american
people
i
want
to
express
my
appreciation
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
justice
department
and
to
the
federal
agents
on
the
front
lines
who
did
the
best
job
they
could
under
deeply
difficult
circumstances
again
i
want
to
say
as
i
did
yesterday
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
loss
of
life
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
tragedy
in
waco
i
hope
very
much
that
others
who
will
be
tempted
to
join
cults
and
to
become
involved
with
people
like
david
koresh
will
be
deterred
by
the
horrible
scenes
they
have
seen
over
the
last
seven
weeks
and
i
hope
very
much
that
the
difficult
situations
which
federal
agents
confronted
there
and
which
they
will
be
doubtless
required
to
confront
in
other
contexts
in
the
future
will
be
somewhat
better
handled
and
better
understood
because
of
what
has
been
learned
now
q
mr
president
can
you
first
of
all
tell
us
why
after
days
you
decided
q
mr
president
can
you
describe
for
us
what
it
is
that
janet
reno
outlined
to
you
in
your
phone
conversation
with
the
president
i
cant
hear
you
both
if
one
will
go
first
and
then
the
other
q
sorry
can
you
describe
what
janet
reno
q
mr
president
the
president
ill
answer
both
your
questions
but
i
cant
do
it
at
once
q
can
you
describe
what
she
told
you
on
sunday
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
and
how
much
detail
you
knew
about
it
the
president
yes
i
was
told
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
fbi
strongly
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
take
another
step
in
trying
to
dislodge
the
people
in
the
compound
and
she
described
generally
what
the
operation
would
be
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
use
tear
gas
which
had
been
tested
not
to
cause
permanent
damage
to
adults
or
to
children
but
which
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
people
to
stay
inside
the
building
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
tear
gas
would
permit
them
to
come
outside
i
was
further
told
that
under
no
circumstances
would
our
people
fire
any
shots
at
them
even
if
fired
upon
they
were
going
to
shoot
the
tear
gas
from
armored
vehicles
which
would
protect
them
and
there
would
be
no
exchange
of
fire
in
fact
as
you
know
an
awful
lot
of
shots
were
fired
by
the
cult
members
at
the
federal
officials
there
were
no
shots
coming
back
from
the
government
side
i
asked
a
number
of
questions
the
first
question
i
asked
is
why
now
we
have
waited
seven
weeks
why
now
the
reasons
i
was
given
were
the
following
number
one
that
there
was
a
limit
to
how
long
the
federal
authorities
could
maintain
with
their
limited
resources
the
quality
and
intensity
of
coverage
by
experts
there
they
might
be
needed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
number
two
that
the
people
who
had
reviewed
this
had
never
seen
a
case
quite
like
this
one
before
and
they
were
convinced
that
no
progress
had
been
made
recently
and
no
progress
was
going
to
be
made
through
the
normal
means
of
getting
koresh
and
the
other
cult
members
to
come
out
number
three
that
the
danger
of
their
doing
something
to
themselves
or
to
others
was
likely
to
increase
not
decrease
with
the
passage
of
time
and
number
four
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
children
who
were
still
inside
the
compound
were
being
abused
significantly
as
well
as
being
forced
to
live
in
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
so
for
those
reasons
they
wanted
to
move
at
that
time
the
second
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general
is
whether
they
had
given
consideration
to
all
of
the
things
that
could
go
wrong
and
evaluated
them
against
what
might
happen
that
was
good
she
said
that
the
fbi
personnel
on
the
scene
and
those
working
with
them
were
convinced
that
the
chances
of
bad
things
happening
would
only
increase
with
the
passage
of
time
the
third
question
i
asked
was
has
the
military
been
consulted
as
soon
as
the
initial
tragedy
came
to
light
in
waco
thats
the
first
thing
i
asked
to
be
done
because
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
not
a
typical
law
enforcement
situation
military
people
were
then
brought
in
helped
to
analyze
the
situation
and
some
of
the
problems
that
were
presented
by
it
and
so
i
asked
if
the
military
had
been
consulted
the
attorney
general
said
that
they
had
and
that
they
were
in
basic
agreement
that
there
was
only
one
minor
tactical
difference
of
opinion
between
the
fbi
and
the
military
something
that
both
sides
thought
was
not
of
overwhelming
significance
having
asked
those
questions
and
gotten
those
answers
i
said
that
if
she
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
that
she
should
proceed
and
that
i
would
support
it
and
i
stand
by
that
today
q
mr
president
the
president
wait
go
ahead
q
can
you
address
the
widespread
perception
reported
widely
television
radio
and
newspapers
that
you
were
trying
somehow
to
distance
yourself
from
this
disaster
the
president
no
im
bewildered
by
it
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
let
me
say
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
is
that
i
had
nothing
to
add
to
what
was
being
said
and
i
literally
did
not
know
until
rather
late
in
the
day
whether
anybody
was
still
alive
other
than
those
who
had
been
actually
seen
and
taken
to
the
hospital
or
taken
into
custody
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
waiting
for
events
to
unfold
there
was
i
have
i
cant
account
for
why
people
speculated
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
talked
to
the
attorney
general
on
the
day
before
the
action
took
place
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
i
called
her
again
late
last
night
after
she
appeared
on
the
larry
king
show
and
i
talked
to
her
again
this
morning
a
president
it
is
not
possible
for
a
president
to
distance
himself
from
things
that
happen
when
the
federal
government
is
in
control
i
will
say
this
however
i
was
frankly
surprised
would
be
a
mild
word
to
say
that
anyone
that
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
should
resign
because
some
religious
fanatics
murdered
themselves
applause
i
regret
what
happened
but
it
is
not
possible
in
this
life
to
control
the
behavior
of
others
in
every
circumstance
these
people
killed
four
federal
officials
in
the
line
of
duty
they
were
heavily
armed
they
fired
on
federal
officials
yesterday
repeatedly
and
they
were
never
fired
back
on
we
did
everything
we
could
to
avoid
the
loss
of
life
they
made
the
decision
to
immolate
themselves
and
i
regret
it
terribly
and
i
feel
awful
about
the
children
but
in
the
end
the
last
comment
i
had
from
janet
reno
is
when
and
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
i
said
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
once
more
why
you
believe
not
why
they
believe
why
you
believe
we
should
move
now
rather
than
wait
some
more
and
she
said
its
because
of
the
children
they
have
evidence
that
those
children
are
still
being
abused
and
that
theyre
in
increasingly
unsafe
conditions
and
that
they
dont
think
it
will
get
any
easier
with
time
with
the
passage
of
time
i
have
to
take
their
word
for
that
so
that
is
where
i
think
things
stand
q
can
we
assume
then
that
you
dont
think
this
was
mishandled
in
view
of
the
outcome
that
you
didnt
run
out
of
patience
and
if
you
had
it
to
do
over
again
would
you
really
decide
that
way
the
president
no
well
i
think
what
you
can
assume
is
just
exactly
what
i
announced
today
this
is
a
the
fbi
has
done
a
lot
of
things
right
for
this
country
over
a
long
period
of
time
this
is
the
same
fbi
that
found
the
people
that
bombed
the
world
trade
center
in
licketysplit
record
time
we
want
an
inquiry
to
analyze
the
steps
along
the
way
is
there
something
else
we
should
have
known
is
there
some
other
question
they
should
have
asked
is
there
some
other
question
i
should
have
asked
can
i
say
for
sure
that
no
one
that
we
could
have
done
nothing
else
to
make
the
outcome
come
different
i
dont
know
that
thats
why
i
want
the
inquiry
and
thats
why
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
we
have
some
independent
law
enforcement
people
not
political
people
but
totally
nonpolitical
outside
experts
who
can
bring
to
bear
the
best
evidence
we
have
there
is
unfortunately
a
rise
in
this
sort
of
fanaticism
all
across
the
world
and
we
may
have
to
confront
it
again
and
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anything
we
can
do
particularly
when
there
are
children
involved
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
wrongdoers
in
this
case
were
the
people
who
killed
others
and
then
killed
themselves
q
mr
president
were
there
any
other
options
presented
to
you
for
resolving
this
situation
at
any
point
from
february
until
yesterday
the
president
well
yes
i
got
regular
reports
all
along
the
way
there
were
lots
of
other
options
pursued
if
you
go
back
you
all
covered
it
very
well
the
fbi
you
did
a
very
good
job
of
it
i
mean
the
fbi
and
the
other
authorities
there
pursued
any
number
of
other
options
all
along
the
way
and
a
lot
of
them
early
on
seemed
to
be
working
some
of
the
children
got
out
some
of
the
other
people
left
there
was
a
at
one
point
there
seemed
to
be
some
lines
of
communication
opening
up
between
koresh
and
the
authorities
and
then
he
would
say
things
and
not
do
them
and
things
just
began
to
spin
downward
whether
there
were
other
in
terms
of
what
happened
yesterday
the
conversation
i
had
with
the
attorney
general
did
not
involve
other
options
except
whether
we
should
take
more
time
with
the
present
strategy
we
were
pursuing
because
they
said
they
wanted
to
do
this
because
they
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
get
people
out
of
the
compound
quickly
before
they
could
kill
themselves
thats
what
they
thought
q
did
the
government
know
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
q
congressional
hearings
once
the
situation
are
you
in
agreement
with
that
the
president
thats
up
to
the
congress
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
but
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
treasury
and
justice
departments
launch
this
investigation
and
bring
in
some
outside
experts
and
as
i
said
in
my
statement
if
any
congressional
committees
want
to
look
into
it
we
will
fully
cooperate
there
is
nothing
to
hide
here
this
was
probably
the
most
wellcovered
operation
of
its
kind
in
the
history
of
the
country
more

waco

conference
part
here
is
a
press
release
from
the
white
house
president
clintons
remarks
on
waco
with
qa
to
national
desk
contact
white
house
office
of
the
press
secretary
washington
april
us
newswire
following
are
remarks
by
president
clinton
in
a
question
and
answer
session
with
the
press
part
of
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
very
well
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
while
the
adults
did
so
the
children
had
no
chance
because
this
gas
was
very
she
said
it
was
not
lethal
but
it
was
very
dangerous
to
the
children
and
they
could
not
have
survived
without
gas
masks
and
on
february
lets
go
back
didnt
those
people
have
a
right
to
practice
their
religion
the
president
they
were
not
just
practicing
their
religion
they
were
the
treasury
department
believed
that
they
had
violated
federal
laws
any
number
of
them
q
what
federal
laws
the
president
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
gas
masks
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpose
of
using
the
tear
gas
was
that
it
had
been
tested
they
were
convinced
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
force
anybody
that
breathed
it
to
run
outside
and
one
of
the
things
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
details
of
this
because
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
things
that
they
were
speculating
about
today
was
that
the
wind
was
blowing
so
fast
that
the
windows
might
have
been
opened
and
some
of
the
gas
might
have
escaped
and
that
may
be
why
it
didnt
have
the
desired
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
was
an
underground
compound
a
bus
buried
underground
where
the
children
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hoping
very
much
that
if
the
children
were
not
released
immediately
outside
that
the
humane
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
children
would
be
sent
someplace
where
they
could
be
protected
in
terms
of
the
gas
masks
themselves
i
learned
yesterday
i
did
not
ask
this
fact
question
before
that
the
gas
was
supposed
to
stay
active
in
the
compound
longer
than
the
gas
masks
themselves
were
to
work
so
that
it
was
thought
that
even
if
they
all
had
gas
masks
that
eventually
the
gas
would
force
them
out
in
a
nonviolent
nonshooting
circumstance
ms
myers
last
question
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
that
q
could
you
tell
us
whether
or
not
you
ever
asked
janet
reno
about
the
possibility
of
a
mass
suicide
and
when
you
learned
about
the
actual
fire
and
explosion
what
went
through
your
mind
during
those
horrendous
moments
the
president
what
i
asked
janet
reno
is
if
they
had
considered
all
the
worse
things
that
could
happen
and
she
said
and
of
course
the
whole
issue
of
suicide
had
been
raised
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debated
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
people
who
were
most
knowledgeable
about
these
kinds
of
issues
concluded
that
there
was
no
greater
risk
of
that
now
than
there
would
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
that
or
at
anytime
in
the
future
that
was
the
judgment
they
made
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
of
course
we
will
never
know
what
happened
when
i
saw
the
fire
when
i
saw
the
building
burning
i
was
sick
i
felt
terrible
and
my
immediate
concern
was
whether
the
children
had
gotten
out
and
whether
they
were
escaping
or
whether
they
were
inside
trying
to
burn
themselves
up
thats
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
know
thank
you
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
it
was
a
janet
reno
decision
isnt
it
in
the
end
your
decision
the
president
well
what
im
saying
is
that
i
didnt
have
a
four
or
fivehour
detailed
briefing
from
the
fbi
i
didnt
go
over
every
strategic
part
of
it
it
is
a
decision
for
which
i
take
responsibility
im
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
signed
off
on
the
general
decision
and
giving
her
the
authority
to
make
the
last
call
when
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
some
time
had
elapsed
she
might
have
made
a
decision
to
change
her
mind
i
said
if
you
decide
to
go
forward
with
this
tomorrow
i
will
support
you
and
i
do
support
her
she
is
not
ultimately
responsible
to
the
american
people
i
am
but
i
think
she
has
conducted
her
duties
in
an
appropriate
fashion
and
she
has
dealt
with
this
situation
i
think
as
well
as
she
could
have
thank
you
applause

but
do
you
knew
how
much
organization
is
required
to
training
a
large
group
of
poeple
twice
a
year
just
to
try
to
get
the
same
people
every
year
provide
a
basic
training
to
new
people
so
they
can
be
integrated
into
the
force
and
find
a
suitable
location
it
requires
a
continually
standing
committee
of
organizers
again
my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
wrong
neglecting
that
the
government
and
media
have
bullshitted
the
people
almost
nonstop
on
this
issue
constitutional
limitations
are
there
to
prevent
a
tyrrany
of
the
majority
for
example
a
majority
could
vote
that
given
ethnics
have
no
rights
are
not
people
etc
and
it
would
fly
using
the
logic
above
when
government
feels
the
constitution
is
not
right
for
the
times
there
is
a
procedure
called
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
this
is
deliberately
difficult
and
cumbersome
to
prevent
abuse
of
those
who
decide
to
ignore
the
people
or
impose
unjust
policies
of
a
majority
on
a
minority
a
lynch
mob
is
a
majority
remember
outvoting
the
hangee
what
the
government
is
doing
are
violations
endruns
around
the
limitations
on
the
government
probably
because
they
know
that
the
people
would
be
very
hard
to
convince
that
a
good
intention
is
behind
tampering
with
the
bill
of
rights
government
propeganda
on
guns
has
been
very
strong
and
persistant
but
not
that
strong
and
it
just
shows
how
gullible
the
people
have
become
to
i
am
from
the
government
and
am
here
to
help
you
sort
of

we
have
been
lied
to
fed
half
truths
rigged
stats
while
the
government
knows
their
control
laws
have
no
effect
on
crime
they
want
a
government
monopoly
on
force
pure
and
simple
do
you
really
want
the
government
to
be
able
to
override
constitutional
limitations
by
a
simple

elitists
congresscritters

you
are
the
only
one
here
claiming
that
the

dependent
on
the
existence
of
a
topflight
wellregulated
militia
why
this
is
a
false
assumption
has
already
been
posted
a
number
of
times
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
and
i
have
also
stated
that
a
militia
that
meets
once
or
twice
a
year
is
clearly
well
organized
and
this
state
of
readiness
that
i
have
claimed
the
people
have
a
right
to
is
the
same
state
of
readiness
expected
of
the
militia
as
stated

you

according

made
in

before

his

all
believed
he
was

koresh
had
sex

these
were
the
perfect

the
great
seed
of
his
magnified

exmembers
describe
him
in
ways
not
dissimilar
to
the
way
jim
jones
has
been
described
i
dont
know
how
accurate
the
documentary
was
the
documentary
interviewed
koresh
and
current
and
exmembers
the
documentary
disucussed
koreshs
christ
status
inside
the

cult
brainwashing
techniques
and
unusual
sex
practices
the
leader
gets
any
he
wants
and
tells
others
when
they
can
or
cant
i
will
let
others
decide
if
using
religious
authority
to
have
sex
with
a
minor
is
technically
child
abuse
or
not
however
koresh
was
never
convicted
of
any
crimes
against
children
nor
was
the
batf
after
him
for
child
abuse
their
purview
in
this
case
is
strictly
in
firearms
violations
all
true
so
this
information
is
irrelevant
to
the
discussion
well
if
a
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
members
of
the
cult
then
the
history
and
background
of
the
cult
is
very
relevant
the
history
and
backgournd
of
the
jones
cult
was
very
important
in
understanding
what
happened
at
jonestown
not
taking
into
account
the
history
and
background

may
also
help
explain
why
the
fbi

so
badly
predicted
the
reponses
they
would
get
from
inside
the
compund
nearly
every
step
of
the
way
in
this
badly
handled
affair
fbi
agents
have
to
pass
rigorous
psychological
examinations
and
background
checks
plus
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
their
decisions
in
great
detail
to
congress
why
would
the
fbi
want
to
fulfill
koreshs
own
prophecy
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
something
but
whether
their
answers
even
remotely
resembles
the
truth
we
may
never
know
and
who
is
left
alive
to
care
whether
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
it
only
holds
meaning
for
the
nine
who
survived
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
at
least
two
investigations
jd
and
congress
at
this
point
correction
the
fbi
said
that
two
of
the
cult
members
said
this
so
far
no
one
else
has
been
able
to
talk
to
them
so
when
they
talk
to
the
news
reporters
directly
and
relate
the
same
details
will
you
believe
them
if
they
confirm
the
story
i
probably
will
definitely
not
until
then
however
interesting
and
conflicting
details
are
starting
to
come
out
i
have
reverted
back
to
wait
mode
to
find
out
whether
the
fire
was
intentional
or
accidental
and
how
it
started

why
it

nobody

imagine

i
seem

recall
that
smokeless

i
would
be
rather
surprised
after
a

of

nature
if
any
of
his

is
unexploded
or
unburned
they
also
had

its

i

i

the

that

this
has

it
nas
nothing

thats
what

inferred
wrong
there
are
people
who
can

carry

there
are

it
ordinary

can
not
get

to

there
are
very
few

who
can
i
even
asked
my

friend
about
this
and
he
told
me
that
only
certain
people
can
get
licenses
for
concealed
carry
he
couldnt
remember
which
people
but
he
knew
for
sure
that
regular
citizens
couldnt
get
that
type
of

he
told

to

more

better

the

do
the

and
your

fall

when
the

batf
has
shown
shitty
leadership
despite
more

better

the

they
could

gone

blasting

killed

it

then
letting

the

protect
everybody
equally
and
how

one

be

perhaps
at
that

you

mature
enough

what

how
serious

biological

out

of

can
there
be
any
hope
for

i
dont
sign
any
blank
checks
of
course
the
term
must
be
rigidly
defined

any
bill
when
doug
foxvog
says
weapons

he
means
cbw
and
nukes
when
sarah
brady
says
weapons

she
means
street
sweeper
shotguns
and
semiautomatic
sks
rifles
i
doubt
she
uses
this
term
for
that
you
are
using
a
quote
allegedly
from
her
can
you
back
it
up
when
john

says
weapons
of

destruction
and
then
immediately
follows
it
with
the
us
has
thousands
of
people
killed
each
year
by
handguns
this
number
can
easily
be
reduced
by
putting
reasonable
restrictions
on
them
what
does
rutledge
mean
by
the
term
i
read
the
article
as
presenting
first
an
argument
about
weapons
of
mass
destruction
as
commonly
understood
and
then
switching
to
other
topics
the
first
point
evidently
was
to
show
that
not
all
weapons
should
be
allowed
and
then
the
later
analysis
was
given
this
understanding
to
consider

if

five
months
or
five
centuries
down
the
road
i
would
hope
so
lets
define
a
nuclear
weapon
as
an
explosive
weapon
whose
majority
of
energy
comes
from
fission
andor
fusion
of
atomic
nuclei
lets
define
a
biological
weapon
as
live
organisms
or
viruses
in
such
state
quantity
and
with
such
a
vector
that
they
could
cause
death
or
serious
disease
further
defined

a

number
of
people
if
released
in
a
city
similarly
populated
area
resevoir
or
cropland
nerve
gas
and
mustard
gas
are
well

other
poisonous
gasses
should
be

banned

if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
no
use
not

licenses
should
be

on

chemicals
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
these
ideas
could
certainly
be
a
basis
for
definitions
ill
give
you
a
little
hint
see
that
manure
pile
in
the
farmers
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
nope
it
is
not
considered
a
weapon
biological
in
nature
because
if
it
gets
washed
into
an
open
well
it
will
contaminate
the
aquifers
that
supply
thousands
of
cities
with
drinking
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
has
ruled
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illegal
care
to
draw
a
thinner

this

it

american
horror
file
call
for
help
todays
atrocity
in
waco
has
finally
impelled
me
to
start
working
on
something
ive
been
thinking
about
for
some
time
over
the
last
few
years
i
have
heard
of
one
case
after
another
of
government
running
completely
amok
unfortunately
most
people
are
oblivious
of
the
governments
crimes
and
still
think
of
it
as
their
protector
so
i
intend
to
put
together
what
i
call
the
american
horror
file
a
compilation
of
cases
where
the
american
government
has
run
roughshod
over
the
rights
of
its
citizens
over
the
last
few
years
focusing
especially
on
deaths
and
injuries
resulting
from
noknock
warrants
and
financial
ruin
to
innocents
resulting
from
civil
forfeiture
laws
but
including
any
other
cases
for
which
i
can
find
decent
documentation
i
hope
to
make
people
bloodboiling
arterybursting
redhot
enraged
at
their
government
the
end
result
will
probably
be
a
book
in
electronic
form
ascii
text
and
postscript
files
detailing
the
governments
crimes
of
recent
years
this
book
will
be
distributed
at
cost
and
i
will
encourage
people
to
post
copies
to
bbss
send
copies
on
disk
to
friends
and
print
out
copies
and
give
them
to
neighbors
this
is
a
call
for
your
help
any
information
that
you
can
send
me
on
how
government
is
running
amok
will
be
greatly
appreciated
i
would
prefer
information
that
is
welldocumented
with
sources
given
about
specific
instances
of
governmental
abuses
i
also
welcome

who
wants

in

this

yes
there
could
be
that
low
sentences

could

figures
but
theyre
still
pretty
high
right
i
also
believe
texas
has
some
of
the
most
liberal
gunlaws
in

i
should
not
suffer
because
of
others
we
all
agree

this
one

we
also
live
in

sociaty
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note

do
you

much
one
state
dont

which
texas
tried

impose
a
rule
that
you
could
only
buy
one
gun
each
month
think
you
all
know
what
happened
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on
other
people
it
seems

you
all

the

medical

for
all
federal
employees
is
a
good
model
for
a

national
system
to
get
emergency
medical
care
anyone
so
insured
must
always
carry
their
blue
cross
card
before
entering
a
hospital
you
must
notify
blue
cross
or
they
will
refuse
to
pay
your
bills
in
an
emergency
where
you
must
be
treated
before
notifying
them
you
must
inform
them
within
hours
or
if
you
are
unable
to
do
so
for
medical
reasons
the
hospital
must
failing
to
do
so
within
hours
means
they
will
not
cover
the
hospitalization
in
you
need
your
card
to
notify
them
and
without
the
card
the
hospital
certainly
wouldnt
know
they
had
to
therefore
you
are
required
to
carry
the
card
at
all
times
or
do
without
emergency
medical
coverage
which
works
fine
until
you
end
up
in
the
hospital
because
you
were
hit
on
the
head
and
your

they

gone

like
the

had
done
other

they
wouldnt

needed
to
have
an

then
herr

wouldnt

told

they

the

kept

miles

the

could

it

perhaps
a

i
guess
we

people
dumb
enough
to
give

to
a

who

really
thats
interesting
as
i
was

of
the
opinion
that
people
dumb

to
keep

around

support
them
with

when
said

is

they

what
that

then
enjoy

he
killed
a

feds
and
they
killed
a

people
of
their
own
including
one
child
at

report
so
what
being
a

agent
is
not
license
to

then
theres

did

is

really

i

no
it

i

i
would
like
to
prove
that
i
was
correct
using
accurate
information
so
i
will
put
sections
down
here
now
good
now
lets
look
at
those
sections
theyll
prove
my
point
a
a
person
commits
the
offense
of
unlawful
use
of
weapons
when
he
knowingly
carries
or
possesses
in
any
vehicle
or
concealed
on
or
about
his
person
except
when
on
his
land
or
in
his
own
abode
or
fixed
place
of
business
any
pistol
revolver
stun
gun
or
taser
or
other
firearm
note
that
this
doesnt
affect
all
concealed
carry
look
after
the
word
except
it
always
helps
to
read
the
law
before
commenting
on
it
would
a
prudent
storekeeper
carry
concealed
how
about
someone
at
home
note
that
both
are
legal
and
a

of
common
people
qualify

i
dont

the
figures
exactly

there
were
about
deaths
in

in
that
was

by
guns
this
is
more
than
those
beeing
killed
in
caraccidents
yes
there
could
be
that
low
sentences
or
high
poverty
could
influence
the
figures
but
theyre
still
pretty
high
right
i
also
believe
texas
has
some
of
the
most
liberal
gunlaws
in
usa
and
youd
be
wrong
about
that
too
note
that
texas
isnt
unique
in
this
more
withgun
deaths
than
withcar
deaths
but
some
of
the
other
states
where
it
happens
have
extremely
strict
gun
laws
oops
so
much
for
the
meaning
it
isnt
clear
that
the
comparision
means
anything
anyway
as
car
accidents
are
unintentional
while
gun
deaths
arent
but
if
were
going
to
make
it
lets
at
least
be
honest
i
should
not
suffer
because
of
others
we
all
agree
on
this
one
but
we
also
live
in
a
sociaty
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
give
it
up
for
what
gun
control
doesnt
have
any
benefits
so
it
fails
by
this
standard
do
you
have
an
insurance
then
youll
have
to
pay
because
of
what
others
do
note
that
insurance
gives
me
something
in
return
gun
control
doesnt
what
the
hell
is
he
trying
to
say
when
you
live
in

society
usa
are
stilll
counted
as
one
you
have
to
saccrifice
the
question
is
how
much
thats
half
the
question
the
rest
is
and
what
do
you
get
for
your
sacrifice
if
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
nothing
as
it
is
for
gun
control
then
we
dont
have
to
ask
the
first
question
because
getting
nothing

why

it

everyone
now
claims

it

stop
and
think
about
this
cs
gas
was
being
pumped
into
the

and
i
presume
that
everyone
was
wearing
gas
masks
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
this
had
been
going
on
for

i
dont

if
you
have
ever
been
around
cs
but
i
have
being
exposed
to
cs
gas
was
part
of
my

training
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
very
uncomfortable
and
makes
your

water
nose
run
and
makes
you
sick
in

and
with
the
mask
it
is
very
difficult
to

much
less

my
question
now
is
why
were
they
cooking
food
i
will
buy
that
a

could
have
been
knocked
over

caused

wellllll
they
werent

theyd
never
harmed
or
even
threatened
anybody
until
they
were

by
a
paramilitary
force
using
military
weapons
and
hardware
and
as

as
evidence
what
are
you
talking
about
everything
the
feds
have
said
theyve
retracted
practically
as
soon
as
they
get
questioned
in
detail
about
it

and
your

buddies
sitting

slurring

like

dont

then
youre

give

suppose
this

what

no

you
dont

any

most

the

would
you

were

what
no

ok
go
ahead
say
it
read
my
lips
no

p
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
not
in
such
a
great
degree
bush
broke
one
promise
maybe
two
taxesguns
and
we
held
him
accountable
for
it
of
course
it
took
him
the
better
part
of
years
to
do
it
slicks
only
been
in
office
days
and
hes
broken
lots
of
them
anddd
i
imagine
hell
also
be
held
accountable
for
that
i
can
just
see
the
campaign
buttons
now
abc
anybody
but
clinton
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
hmmm
apparently
you
just
got
here
nobodys
claiming
that
it
was
anything
but
a
stupid
mistake
by
a
bunch
of
incompetent
public
employees
who
normally
dont
get
this
kind
of
scrutiny
when
the
mess
up
and
as
far
as
how
they
picked
the
davidians
who
knows
maybe
they
figured
that
nobodyd
care
about
such
a
politically
incorrect
group
as
a
bunch
of
fundies
out
on
the
texas
prairie
maybe
they
figured
theyd
just
go
in
there
and
run
roughshod
over
the
bds
during
their
religious
services
which
was
the
reason
the
feds
gave
for
the
timing
of
the
raid
rather
than
running
into
resistance
maybe
they
knew
that
the
bds
werent
anywhere
near
as
violent
as
the
feds
spin
doctors
are
trying
to
tell
the
public
maybe
they
were
afraid
to
try
this
kind
of
thing
on
the
crips
and
bloods
maybe
it
was
because
the
atfs
budget
is
up
for
approval
and
they
seem
to
favor
doing
something
dramatic
whenever
that
is
the
case
of
course
their
reasoning
doesnt
matter
only
what
they
did
and
this
time
people
are
just
paying
more
attention
to
it
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth
vader
not
if
you

did
they
or
did
they
not

i
dont

the
text
of

case
handy
miller
was
convicted
of
owning
a
sawedoff
shotgun
and
not
paying
the
nfa
tax
snatches
of
the
courts
decision
the
second
amendment
was
intended
to
assure
the
continuation
and
render
possible
the
effectiveness
of
such
a
force
the
militia
it
must
be
interpreted
and
applied
with
that
end
in
view
the
militia
includes
all
males
physically
capable
of
acting
in
concert
for
the
common
defense
however
regarding
sawedoff
shotguns
certainly
it
is
not
within
judicial
notice
that
this
weapon
is
any
part
of
the
ordinary
military
equipment
or
that
its
use
could
contribute
to
the
common
defense
judicial
notice
is
the
term
of
art
here
it
meant
that
no
such
evidence
had
been
formally
presented
this
is
different
from
claiming
that
they
had
ruled
that
it
wasnt
yes
shotguns
had
been
used
in
wwi
the
spanishamerican
war
and
the
us
civil
war
that
was
not
in
question
the
possession
of
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
ie
a
weapon
altered
to
improve
concealibility
im
not
talking
about
plain
shotguns
in
war
im
talking
about
short
barrelled
sawedoff
shotguns
in
war
compare
revolutionary
war
blunderbusses
luparas
in
the
spanishamerican
war
and
trenchcleaners
in
ww
i
they
were
also
put
to
good
use
by

soldiers
in

ii
not
to
mention
being

but
of

miller
took
place

therefore
us
vs
miller
supports
limited
government
regulation
of
firearms
dont
go
arguing
down
this
road
unless
you
are
willing
to
abide
by
the
consequences
that
you
find
at
the
end
of
it
mainly
that
the
lawabiding
common
man
has
a
right
to
own
any
weapon
that
has
a
militia
purpose
from
handguns
to
sawedoff
shotguns
and
fully
automatic
weapons
that
in
fact
is
what
this
decision
says
you
are
free
to
produce
evidence
that
im
not
willing
to
abide
with
all
the
implications
of
this
here
is
my
quandary
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
certain
types
of
guns
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
second
this
isnt
a
useful
argument
unless
you
believe
that
some
significant
gun
or
class
of
gun
belongs
in
that
class
i
think
we
both
agree
that
zip
guns
probably
arent
protected
maybe
we
also
both
agree
that
all
the
weapons
that
random
state
governments
have
been
banning
or
trying
to
ban
because
they
have
no
sporting
purpose
and
no
provate
citizen
would
ever
need
these
guns
do
fall
under
the
protection
of
the
second
so
given
that
damn
near
any
gun
of
any
practical
utility
is
or
has
at
some
time
been
used
by
the
military
even
if
only
for
marksmanship
training
purposes
i
need
to
understand
why
you
are
intent
on
pressing
this
point
arguing
that
that
something
is
not
protected
by
the
second
just
because
i

the

this

what
confuses
me
according
to
the
federalist

a
well

has
a
well
defined
structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the
federalist

besides
the
advantage
of

which
the

the
existence
of
subordinate

a

can
reasonably
be

with

than
to
have
them
properly
armed
and
equipped
and
in
order
to
see
that
this
be
not
neglected
it
will
be
necessary
to
assemble
them
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of

year
alexander
hamilton
federalist
paper
speaking
of
standing
armies
if
circumstances
should
at
any
time
oblige
the
government
to
form
an
army
of
any
magnitude
that
army
can
never
be
formidable
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
while
there
is
a
large
body
of
citizens
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
them
in
discipline
and
the
use
of
arms
who
stand
ready
to
defend
their
own
rights
and
those
of
their
fellowcitizens
but
surely
hamilton
and
madison
didnt
mean
the
people
when
they
said
people
right
thats
why
the
amendment
refers
to
the
right
of
the
militia
your
average
year
old
male
does
not
fall
into
the
definition
youre
right
the
militia
consists
of
all
able
bodied
males
and
probably
females
under
current
interpretation
therefore
most
members
of
the
militia
the
one
the
every
gun
advocate
refers
to
are
not
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
and
therefore
are
not
directly
the
amendment
does
nor
refer
to
well
organized
it
says
well
regulated
i
have
some
targets
you
may
examine
if
you
wish
to
check
how
well
regulated
i
am
mentioned
in
the
amendment
if
this
amendment
wanted
to
allow
every
member
of
the
militia
to
keep
and
bear
arms
why
did
it
specificly
mention
a
well
organized
militia
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
correct
thats
why
the
right
is
reserved
to
the
people
and
that
was
to
insure
the
people
could
form
a
well
regulated
militia
not
a
well
organized
militia
it
could
be
argued
that
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
is
separate
from
the
last
part
if
so
why
was
it
include
in
the
same
atomic
unit
of
written
what
do
atomic
units
have
to
do
with
this
argument
any
moron
can
set
hbar
c
instead
of
a
separate
sentence
oh
i
see
what
your
question
is
why
dont
you
read
the
federalist
papers
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
but
what
does
madison
know
about
the
grammatical
style
of
the
he
only
wrote
it
the
amendment
also
implies
that
the
right
to
arms
has
to
due
with
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
federalist
papers
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
gives
many
examples
of
how
this
militia
protects
the
security
of
a
free
state
all
these
examples
are
actions
of
a
very
organized
force
not
some
john
q
public
with
a
gun
thats
obviously
because
youve
never
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
is
that
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulated
militias
shall
not
be
infringed
that
is
people
have
the
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
this
well
organized
militia
will
of
course
provide
training
in
how
to
use
arms
and
in
basic
military
tactics
these
training
members
of
the
militia
can
keep
and
bear
the
arms
cant
read
huh
show
me
where
the
document
says
well
organized
militia
lastly
reading
through
the
federalist
papers
on
well
organized
militia
it
is
very
clear
that
many
of
the
reasons
for
these
militias
one
reason
stated
is
the
protection
from
a
standing
army
these
days
the
standing
army
could
easily
defeat
a
group
consisting
of
every
year
old
male
and
female
not
in
the
armied
forces
that
is
exactly
why
every
person
should
be
allowed
to
own
any
weapon
currently
in
use
in
the
armed
forces
another
reason
stated
for
well
organized
militias
is
to
reduced
the
need
for
a
standing
army
well
the
us
armied
forces
have
been
a
standing
army
for
more
than
half
the
history
of
the
us
but
the
major
reason
is
to
protect
against
that
very
same
army
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
reason
for
the
second
amendment
to
give
the
people
protection
from
the
us
government
by
guaranteeing
that
the
people
can
over
through
the
government
if
necessary
is
a
little
bit
of
an
anachronism
is
this
day
and
age
maybe
its
time
to
rethink
how
this
should
be
done
and
amend

john
lawrence
rutledge
writes
so
the
phrase
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
must
either
qualify
or
explain
the
phrase
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
stuff
deleted
since
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
does
not
describe
modify
or
make
less
harsh
anything
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
grammar
or
some
sort
of
position
or
task
by
process
of
elimination
it
must
fall
into
definition
and
since
deals
with
legal
power
the
same
thing
the
constitution
does
it
must
be
the
correct
definition
in
this
case
therefore
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
gives
legal
power
to
the
well
regualated
militia
and
this
legal
power
shall
not
be
infringed
ah
clarification
by
obfuscation
actually
the
words
a
well
regulated
milita
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
present
participle
used
as
an
adjective
to
modify
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
the
subject
being
the
right
the
verb
shall
it
asserts
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
essential
for
maintaining
a
milita
the
sentence
doesnt
restrict
the
right
or
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
by
anyone
or
anything
other
than
the
people
all
it
does
is
make
a
positive
statement
regarding
a
right
of
the
people
the
people
as
in
you
and
me
as
in
the
first
fourth
ninth
tenth
as
well
as
the
second
amendment
the
existence
of
this
right
is
assumed
it
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
there
is
no
stated
or
implied
condition
relating
the
right
to
bear
arms
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
in
other
words
the
entire
sentence
says
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
unconditional
so
in
effort
not
to
force
my
views
and
not
to
destory
our
liberties
and
rights
i
state
that
nothing
i
have
written

write
in
the
matter
of

is

the

weaver
trial
day
this
was
posted
to
the
firearmspolitics

hi
folks
wednesday
marked
day
the
beginning
of
the
trial
opening
statements
were
given
by
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
each
side
presenting
its
version
of
what
happenned
last
august
the
prosecution
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
idaho
in
anticipating
a
battle
with
the
evil
federal
government
the
prosecution
alleges
that
weaver
sold
federal
agents
sawed
off
shotguns
and
later
failed
to
appear
for
trial
despite
repeated
good
faith
efforts
to
get
weaver
to
surrender
peacefully
weaver
refused
the
shootout
erupted
when
weaver
discovered
agents
on
a
surveillance
mission
and
began
firing
according
to
the
prosecution
three
people
were
taking
an
offensive
action
against
an
fbi
helicopter
when
an
fbi
sniper
killed
vicki
weaver
the
defense
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
northern
idaho
in
to
practice
their
religion
in
peace
they
wanted
simply
to
be
left
alone
weaver
was
induced
by
federal
agents
to
sell
the
shortbarrelled
shotgun
and
did
not
as
the
prosecution
alleged
want
to
become
a
regular
supplier
the
defense
also
argued
that
the
federal
government
sought
to
arrest
weaver
when
he
wouldnt
become
an
informant
it
is
not
specified
explicitly
but
i
assume
that
this
is
a
reference
to
the
white
separatist
angle
of
the
story
well
know
more
as
things
develop
the
failure
to
appear
in
court
happenned
because
weaver
was
given
an
incorrect
court
date
and
then
indicted
before
that
date
the
shootout
occurred
when
federal
agent
arthur
roderick
killed
weavers
dog
that
was
in
proximity
to
weavers
son
samuel
weaver
then
fired
in
selfdefense
in
the
ensuing
battle
federal
agent
william
degan
was
killed
when
his
gun
was
later
found
there
were
cases
nearby
and
the
gun
was
on
semiautomatic
however
agents
were
near
the
body
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
could
have
played
with
the
selectfire
this
will
have
to
be
more
fully
explained
finally
the
defense
claims
that
vicki
weaver
was
only
going
to
look
at
the
body
not
recover
of
her
son
when
she
was
cutdown
by
an
fbi
sniper
prosecution

confrontation

the
evidence
in
this
case
is
going
to
show
that
this
is
a
case
where
randy
weaver
and
kevin
harris
are
charged
with
crimes
they
didnt
commit
in
order
to
cover
crimes
that
the
government
did
commit

nice
soundbite

the
idaho
statesman
claims
that
weaver
supporters
heeded
a
call
from
spence
not
to
repeat
yesterdays
protests
outside
the
courthouse
however
the
local
nbc
affiliate
again
had
footage
on
the
news
with
supporters
including
tim
again
tim
claimed
he
was
a
skinhead
who
were
ordinary
working
class
people
he
also
claimed
he
was
for
white
pride
not
white
power
outside
the
courthouse
the
television
crew
had
an
impromptu
interview
with
bo
gritz
who
charged
that
the
neonazi
protestors
are
exactly
what
the
government
wants
to
smear
randy
weaver
in
an
affiliated
article
carried
in
the
idaho
statesman
about
a
dozen
lawyers
were
among
the
or
so
people
packed
into
the
courthouse
these
lawyers
were
present
to
watch
gerry
spence
in
action
and
to
perhaps
learn
something
from
him
some
tidbits
spence
flatly
told
the
jurors
that
he
and
his
son
kent
were
volunteering
their
time
to
represent
weaver
because
they
believed
in
him
spence
during
his
opening
statement
repeatedly
walked
behind
weaver
and
placed
his
hands
on
the
defendants
shoulders
weaver
broke
down
and
cried
during
the
recounting
of
his
wifes
death
and
spence
compared
the
sawed
off
shotgun
to
driving

the

hi

thursday
april
marked
day
of
the
trial
this
day
marked
the
first
testimony
of
the
trial
deputy
us
marshal
larry
cooper
took
the
stand
for
the
prosecution
the
short
version
is
that
his
testimony
was
consistent
with
the
opening
statements
for
the
prosecution
cooper
testified
that
he
had
arrived
in
spokane
washington
on
august
to
participate
in
a
surveillance
operation
with
five
other
deputies
near
the
weaver
cabin
the
team
was
using
night
vision
equipment
for
surveillance
and
split
up
into
two
teams
of
three
people
the
six
later
met
at
an
observation
point
above
the
cabin
after
this
deputies
cooper
william
degan
and
arthur
roderick
began
a
descent
to
scout
further
possible
surveillance
sites
cooper
told
the
court
that
roderick
threw
two
large
rocks
into
a
gully
to
see
whether
the
weaver
family
dogs
would
respond
striker
the
weavers
yellow
lab
started
toward
them
barking
loudly
roderick
led
the
three
in
a
run
from
the
area
they
ran
through
some
dense
woods
into
an
open
area
called
the
fern
field
with
the
dog
in
pursuit
by
this
time
kevin
harris
and
samuel
weaver
had
joined
the
chase
the
surveillance
team
had
reached
a
y
in
the
road
cooper
decided
that
they
should
take
cover
in
the
woods
because
otherwise
they
would
be
an
easy
target
and
might
be
shot
in
the
back
as
degan
reached
the
y
he
spotted
randy
weaver
coming
down
the
road
from
the
cabin
ahead
weaver
was
startled
but
did
not
fire
at
this
moment
striker
reached
degan
and
cooper
had
to
fend
him
off
with
his
gun
it
is
unclear
whether
this
means
he
clubbed
the
dog
or
shot
the
dog
both
cooper
and
degan
then
took
cover
in
the
woods
according
to
cooper
kevin
harris
and
samuel
weaver
continued
walking
down
the
road
apparently
not
noticing
the
two
after
they
had
passed
by
on
the
road
degan
got
up
on
one
knee
raised
his
gun
and
shouted
stop
us
marshal
harris
then
brought
the
weapon
around
at
hip
level
and
fired
he
didnt
bring
the
weapon
up
to
eye
level
i
saw
bills
arm
going
back
and
i
knew
he
had
been
hit
cooper
fired
at
harris
and
harris
went
down
cooper
then
brought
his
weapon
to
bear
on
samuel
but
did
not
fire
at
this
point
cooper
then
heard
two
shots
to
his
right
samuel
weaver
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
shots
yelled
you
son
of
a
bitch
and
ran
toward
them
cooper
then
realized
that
shots
were
coming
at
him
from
directly
ahead
so
he
fired
a
threeround
burst
at
the
cabin
at
this
point
he
then
saw
samuel
weaver
running
toward
the
cabin
when
cooper
reached
degan
he
placed
his
first
two
fingers
on
degan
carotid
artery
counted
two
or
three
beats
and
then
his
heart
stopped
shortly
thereafter
roderick
and
the
other
three
marshals
joined
him
they
then
all
heard
a
large
burst
of
gunfire
from
the
area
around
the
cabin
on
crossexamination
david
nevin
questioned
the
point
of
throwing
rocks
into
the
gulley
asking
you
wanted
to
lure
that
dog
out
so
you
could
shoot
that
dog
didnt
you
nevin
also
pointed
out
that
in
last
septembers
testimony
cooper
had
claimed
that
he
spotted
weaver
after
the
dog
had
left
him
cooper
claimed
that
he
had
gone
over
the
events
in
his
head
and
decided
that
thursdays
account
was
correct
nevin
continued
the
crossexamination
by
asking
what
cooper
would
have
done
had
an
armed
man
dressed
in

jumped
out
of

non

an

has
given
no

that
such

will
occur
in

that
the

attorney

were
all

in
the

that
led
to
the

they
should
also
suspend

you

the

side
of

story
the
other
is
that
d
koresh
met
agents
at

door
with

weapon
remember
the
affidavit
indicates
that
koresh
had
spent
on
assault
weapons
in
the

year
and
now
we
know
that
the
bunker
adjacent
to
the

is

deep
with

rounds
of

the

statement
was
that
there
was
worth
of
firearms
and
ammunition
no
mention
of
assault
weapons
on
the
premises
not
that

had
purchased
them
what
would
his
crime
be
if
he
had
this
averages
to
about
per

not

we
dont

we

the

this

why
did

start

three
different

where
there
were
no
apvs
the
crushed
remains
of
a
pressurized
propane
tank
were
found
in
the
ruins
of
the
bd
compound
the
key
word
is
pressurized
when
that
baby
was
crushed
the
gas
would
have
gone
all
over
the
place
and
when
ignited
would
look
just
like
the
pictures
of
the
explosion
we
saw
on
the
tv
news
ammo
doesnt
go
up
all
at
once
kind
of
like
fireworks
going
off
propane
gas
goes
off
in
a
big
fireball
gee
thats
kind
of
consistent
with
what
the
pictorial
history
shows
hmmmmm
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
remember
pressurized
gas
people
all
over
the
building
conflagration
in
less
than
a
minute
huge
explosion
gas
masks
being
worn
by
the
inhabitants
makes
a
lot
of
sense
that
very
few
of
those
on
the
inside
would
even
know
that
the
tank
was
damaged
if
they
thought
it
was
just
a
normal
fire
they
would
probably
be
trying
to
put
it
out
then
boom
the
fireball
after
that
explosion
and
concussion
i
doubt
anybody
on
the
inside
of
the
building
was
capable
of
moving
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
good
question
take
an
objective
look
at
what
happened
listen
to
the
things
that
the
fbi
said
the
bds
started
the
fire
the
bds
bodies
were
found
with
gunshot
wounds
that
are
now
being
refuted
by
the
evidence
being
recovered
seems
that
the
fbi
is
deliberately
making
statements
that
have
no
rational
basis
in
fact
and
trying
to
make
them
sound
like
fact
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
yes
i
would
still
believe
that
the
fbi
and
the
batf
were
on
a
nonstop
string
of
lies
and
halftruths
this
is
consistent
with
their
operations
on
numerous
occasions
and
as
for
the
bds
being
murderous
they
did
not
cause
any
problems
until
they
were
assaulted
by
the
batf
so
now
a
thought
experiment
for
you
if
the
batf
had
never
stormed
that
farm
would
four
agents
and
bds
be
dead
today
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
yes
that
is
how
politicians
are
elected
kind
of
scary
isnt
it
now
if
we
as
a
people
actually
held
mr
clinton
to
his
promises
instead
of
apologizing
and
denying
that
he
ever
made
them
and
actually
expected
accountability
by
our
government
i
doubt
that
debacles
like
waco
would
happen
as
often
as
they
do
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty

are
they

im

to

acutally
no
the
batf
has
a
rather
checkered
history
of
staging
raids
of
this
sort
just
prior
to
the
time
when
their
budget
comes
up
for
review

enough
their
budget
was
about

just
two
weeks

raid
on

coincidence
i
think
not
and
as
for
the
fire
what
happened
was
caused
by
the
act
of
knocking
over
walls
with
an
armored
vehicle
of
destruction
the
fbi
tried
to
convince
the
world
it
was
suicide
but
all
of
the
facts
that
are
coming
out
by
the
investigation
of
the
texas
rangers
and
medical
examiners
point
to
a
gas
explosion
and
quick
fire
that
decimated
all
of
the
occupants
of
the
building
sounds
to
me
like
a
law

so

we

two

what
the

says
this
includes
what
the
government
says
that
two

have
said
what
koreshs
lawyer
who
was
actually
inside
the
compound
says
including
what
he
says
that
most
of
the

have
said
strange
but
they
seem
to
disagree
in
most
important
particulars
if
anyone
has
actually
seen
news
reports
of
any
of
the
survivors
speaking
firsthand
feel
free
ot
pitch
in
i
may
have
missed
it
but
my
money
is
that
their
story
will
sound
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
case
and
not
at
all
like
case
since
neither
side
would
be
particularly
interested
in
telling
the
truth
you
have
to
weigh
the
facts
given
by
each
yourself
and
weigh
it
with
the
newsreporting
if
you
care
many
cult
members
will
probably
side
with
the
attorney
and
if
he
is
lying
change
their
stories
to
match
his
and
if
the
feds
also
lie
the
cult
members
who
become
disillusioned
will
change
their
stories
to
match
the
feds
neither
sides
are
interested
in
the
truth
the
media
is
more
interested
but
usually
either
dont
have
the
time
to
get
it
straight
or
tie
themselves
to
the
ratings
and
deliberately
distort
for
me
though
the
black
soot
billowing
outside
the
compound
added
with
how
fast
the
fire
spread
ponted
to
someone
dousing
large
parts
of
the
compound
with
some
sort
of
gasoline
or
firestarter
i
doubt
the
feds
did
that
as
they
were
more
interested
in
arresting
vernon
the
real
unbalanced
one
at
least
the
one
that
lost
his
cool
was
vernon
so
i
figured
that
he
was
more
likely
to
do
it
after
all
he
was
jesus
being
persecuted
by
the
authorities
and
had
followers
to
hold
onto
so
made
the
decision
he
and
his
followers
also
probably
felt
that
they
were
rocketing

all

the
tarrant
couonty
me
who
is
doing
the
autopsies
is
well
known
for
rendering
judgements
that
are
contrary
to
the
police
view
he
presented
evidence
a
few
years
ago
that
a
man
who
police
said
was
pointing
a
gun
at
them
actually
had
his

in

this
does
not
bode
well
for
the

in

the
texas

the

have
no

love

i

the

squeezed

resented

atf
now
has
two

finally
i
guess
that
makes
three
notes
rumour
from

is
that
four

were
stopped
by
four

this

there
is
no

to

the

the
first
indicator
that
something
is
wrong
ie
the
copy
has
been

is
the
modern
capitalization

the
next
thing
to
go
is
the
spelling
and
then
ive
even
seen
versions
where
the
grammar
was
modernized
oh

dont

modernizing
the

wont

the

back
but
they
agreed

a

and
they
allowed
the

their

the

even
released
the
atf

they
captured
it
is
clear
from
the
release
of
the
agents
and
allowing
the
atf
medical
attention
that
the

were
not
looking
for
trouble
if
the

were
violent
they
would
have
held

they
would

they
did
if
they
had
kept

they
could

a
big

is
being
made
of
the

collection
of
weapons
but
no
one
has
shown
that
they
had
any
plans

it
is
also
apparent
that
the

did
not
have
any
military
training
if
they
had
they
could
have
dug
bunkers

increased

they

it

that
the

were
not

they
shot
back
at
the

out
of

there
were
shots

when
the

got
big
enough
and
broke
through
the
walls
it
appeared
to
be

in

places
but
was
really
one
big
fire
because
of
the
large
quantities
of

inserted
into

it
is

that
many
of

advanced

by

advanced

use

to
rapidly

precisely

of

these
advanced
telecommunications
systems
are
integral
to
the
infrastructure
needed
to
ensure
economic
competitiveness
in
the
information
age
despite
its
benefits
new
communications
technology
can
also
frustrate
lawful

electronic

sophisticated

can
have
this
effect
in

when
exported
abroad
it
can
be
used
to
thwart
foreign

critical
to

in

it

while
at

time
protecting

as
encryption
technology
improves
doing
so
will
require
new
innovative
approaches
in
the
area
of

encryption
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of
keys
will
allow
the

to
gain

according
to

by

in

the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured

crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
if
there
was
a
large
propane
tank
and
it
was
breached
dont
you
think
that
there
would
be
an
identifiable
explosion
further
the
bd
members
have
as
much
reason
to
lie
as
the
govt
medical
examiners
have
found
no
bullet
wounds
as
was
stated
by
the
fbi
on

corpses
theyd
only
autopsied
one
body
when
this
information
was
released
i
wouldnt
doubt
though
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
only
evidence
that
exists
right
now
at
least
what
we
know
about
is
various
claims

counter

waiting

i

it

that

not

so
far
the

according
to
the

has

no

of
gunshot
wounds
in

so
far
examined
if
this

it
and

going

do

launch

like
they
do

the

hardly
moves
it
is
the
brass
casing
that
goes
flying
and
then
with
less
than
lethal
force
it
will
hurt
yes
but
not
kill
you
i
doubt
if
it
wil
penetrate
a

how
about
an

with
full

charges
to

any

illegalcriminal
activity
on
the
part
of
both
the

and
fbi
i
cannot
see
any
reason
why
not
to
use
the
phrase
they
like
to
use
so
often
if
they
have
nothing
to
hide
they
should
welcome
it
and
vigorously
support
it
note
that
an
internal

by
the

is
not

to
rob
and
all

that
have
been
debating
about
the
wood
stove
the
original

claimed
that
the
atffbi
was
pumping
napalm
into
the
building
with
the
hopes
that
the
wood
stove
inside
would
ignite
it
i
responed
with
why
would
the
wood
stove
be
lit
in
the
first
place
it
wouldnt
be
lit
for
heating
purposes
because
of
the
weather
in
texas
which
statement
is
dead
wrong
because
our
local
posters
have
confirmed
that
it
was
quite
chilly
that
morning
everyone
now
claims
that
it
was
for
cooking
no
we
argue
that
it
was
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
a
woodstove
to
be
operational
stop
and
think
about
this
cs
gas
was
being
pumped
into
the
building
and
i
presume
that
everyone
was
wearing
gas
masks
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
this
had
been
going
on
for
hours
i
dont
know
if
you
have
ever
been
around
cs
but
i
have
being
exposed
to
cs
gas
was
part
of
my
army
training
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
very
uncomfortable
and
makes
your
eyes
water
nose
run
and
makes
you
sick
in
the
stomach
and
with
the
mask
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
water
much
less
eat
so
my
question
now
is
why
were
they
cooking
food
obviously
you
missed
my
earlier
posting
about
the
physica
of
woodstoves
in
brief
you
cant
turn
your
woodstove
on
and
off
like
your
gas
range
it
stays
on
all
the
time
it
even
stays
on
for
over
hours
after
you
shut
it
off
which
is
why
most
working
woodstoves
arent
ever
shut
off

keep

here
we

applaud

saw
a
real
interesting
report
on
cnn
last
night
it
seems
the
gas
that
was
used
has
been
banned
by
international
law
for
military
use
however
our
president
was
quick
to
point
out
that
there
are
exemptions
for
law
enforcement
hmmm
too
inhumane
to
use
in
war
against
the
enemy
but
ok
for
civilians
whoa

what

you
the

on
any

evidence
please
please
dont
misinterret
what
i
was
saying
joe
i
was
making
the
point
tha
there
is
no
evidence
of
effect
of
gun
buyback
programs
but
hopefully
if
there
is
any
effect
it
may
prevent
injuries
or
deaths
in
one
of
these
types
of
common
incidents
saying
hopefully
the
effect
of
policy
x
will
be
y
is
much
different
from
saying
hopefully
if
there
is
any
effect
of
policy
x
it
will
be
y
here
youve
made
both
statements
if
the
former
describes
a
reasonablylikely
outcome
of
policy
x
then
perhaps
policy
x
is
worthy
of
consideration
but
the
latter
statement
is
not
something
to
base
policy
decisions
on
firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
according
to
groups
like
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
formerly
the
national
coalition
to
ban
handguns
interesting
name
change
dont
you
think
who
include
murder
and
suicide
by
firearms
in
the
leading
causes
of
unintentional
death
figures
but
dont
include
murder
and
suicide
by
other
means
as
causes
of
unintentional
death
cant
you
see
past
the
bullshit
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
certainly
accidental
deaths
by
any
cause
are
serious
things
but
the
antigun
groups
insist
over
and
over
again
that
accidental
death
by
firearms
is
a
stastically
serious
problem
and
even
if
you
dont
use
these
deaths
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
these
groups
do
im
sorry
if
i
jumped
to
conclusions
about
your
reason
for
mentioning
accidental
deaths
due
to
firearms
being
something
that
warranted
concern
but
in
light
of
your
statement
that
you
are
a
staunch
supporter
of
gun
control
measures
i
think
the
conclusion
was
a
reasonable
one
the
fact
remains
that
tragic
though
individual
accidental
gun
deaths
may
be
they
are
not
a
serious
problem
statistically
speaking
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
sorry
if
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
i
thought
you
were
waffling
on
your
view
of
buyback
programs
with
the
talk
of
symbolic
offerings
and
hopefully
preventing
accidents
and
heatofpassion
shootings
i
have
to
disagree
on
all
these
counts
i
cant
understand
how
a
buying
guns
from
people
who
arent
intending
to
misuse
them
obviously
those
who
want
to
use
guns
to
commit
crimes
arent
going
to
turn
them
in
could
be
construed
as
a
positive
way
for
police
to
respond
to
interpersonal
violence
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
what
the
people
who
publish
figures
saying
that
as
many
children
commit
suicide
by
handguns
alone
each
year
as
the
fbi
says
commit
suicide
by
all
methods
per
year
who
do
you
think
i
should
believe
the
people
who
call
everyone
up
to
age
children
when
theyre
screaming
about
the
carnage
of
our
nations
children
being
caused
by
handguns
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
ah
yes
the
agency
that
considers
accidental
shootings
of
children
to
be
such
a
statistical
problem
that
a
stated
objective
in
the
healthy
people
document
is
to
enact
laws
in
states
requiring
manufacturers
of
handguns
to
make
the
handguns
more
difficult
to
fire
minimizing
the
likelihood
of
accidental
or
intentional
dscharge
by
children
the
agency
that
funded
the
study
of
dc
which
pronounced
that
the
dc
gun
ban
had
saved
x
lives
yes
they
actually
gave
us
a
number
on
the
basis
of
a
look
at
the
number
of
shootings
rather
than
the
rate
of
shootings
it
wasnt
their
fault
that
the
population
of
dc
dropped
in
their
post
law
period
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
okay
ill
concede
i
no
longer
have
the
numbers
i
once
read
on
these
ill
retract
my
dispute
of
your
numbers
however
i
would
be
greatly
interested
in
seeing
how
cphv
and
cdc
came
up
with
these
numbers
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
whats
this
got
to
do
with
anything
hell
when
i
was
in
elementary
school
i
came
home
to
an
empty
house
with
guns
in
it
why
is
this
a
problem
i
didnt
touch
the
guns
i
had
been
taught
not
to
i
had
also
been
taught
not
to
mess
with
the
gasoline
in
the
garage
the
fuse
box
the
car
the
knives
the
oven
and
the
tools
the
problem
is
not
the
guns
its
the
parents
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in
schools
between
amd
these
are
the
statistics
and
what
are
these
states
doing
with
the
kids
they
find
with
guns
nothing
no
criminal
prosecution
no
expulsion
in
most
cases
not
even
suspension
they
take
the
gun
slap
the
kids
on
the
wrist
say
aint
it
awful
and
go
on
as
if
everythings
back
to
normal
whats
wrong
with
this
picture
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
i
dont
think
koresh
was
the
messiah
either
but
isnt
it
obvious
that
if
he
believed
the
forces
of
evil
were
come
to
destroy
him
then
he
believed
the
children
were
much
safer
inside
the
compound
i
didnt
say
he
was
sane
just
that
he
behaved
in
a
pretty
rational
manner
given
what
he
thought
was
going
on
he
thought
he
had
them
in
the
one
place
where
harm
wouldnt
come
to
them
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive

according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the

the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
if
there
was
a
large
propane
tank
and
it
was
breached
dont
you
think
that
there
would
be
an

explosion
there
was
at
least
one
blast
consistent
with
petroleum
products
that
i
saw
however
propane
is
interesting
stuff
it
doesnt
explode
on
contact
with
air
it
is
possible
for
a
tank
to
rupture
without
exploding
far
more
likely
however
is
that
the
compound
was
equipped
with
ng
outlets
running
to
the
tank
damage
from
the
cevs
could
have
ruptured
the
gas
lines
allowing
the
gas
to

in
the

propane
typically
has
a
distinctive
odor
added
to
it
for
just
this
reason
to
smell
leaks
until
reaching
a
flame
or
spark
and
then
whooosh

their

is
to

not

koresh
had
lied
and
lied
and
lied
about
coming
out
of
the
compound
to
the
fbi
to
his
lawyer
to
just
about
everyone
i
keep
hearing
this
but
every
assertion
of
this
form
has
come
from
government
sources
except
two
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
ready
to
stipulate
that
koresh
ever
promised
to
come
out
except
for
his
first
promise
and
his
last
promise
the
first
promise
was
conditional
on
his
audio
tape
being
given
national
exposure
well
it
never
was
it
was
broadcast
locally
in
a
choppedup
fashion
and
thats
all
and
even
then
they
cleverly
cut
it
off
when
it
got
to
the
part
where
he
demanded
national
exposure
but
not
so
cleverly
that
we
didnt
hear
it
the
last
promise
was
conditional
on
the
finishing
of
his
manuscript
well
never
know
if
he
would
have
kept
that
one
the
fbi
etc
cant
wait
forever
for
koresh
to
come
out
as
long
as
they
thought
that
koreshs
intended
to
surrender
peacefully
when
they
lost
hope
in
that
they
decided
to
go
in
strangely
enough
the
previous
day
they
said
they
were
prepared
to
wait
as
long
as
it
takes
further
while
the
mondays
tactics
were
silly
and
clumsy
they
were
obviously
intended
to
drive
the
davidians
out
of
the
compound
not
to
kill
koresh
and
his
followers
quite
possible
but
arguments
of
intent
do
not
mark
the
dividing
line
between
guilt
and
innocence
only
the
line
between
murder
and
negligent
manslaughter
if
it
is
true
i
read
in
the
paper
that
the
government
listening
devices
inside
the
compound
picked
up
orders
to
burn
the
joint
down
shortly
before
the
fire
was
started
im
waiting
to
see
what
the
tapes
really
hold
this
would
be
an
interesting
development
the
davidian
may
be
telling
the
truth
or
he
may
be
lying
to
save
his
skin
from
possible
murder
charges
resulting
from
the
blaze
koreshs
lawyer
being
the
attorney
for
at
least
one
surviving
davidian
has
an
interest
in
claiming
that
the
govt
caused
the
fire
at
least
as
much
as
the
govt
has
an
interest
in
blaming
koresh
for
the
fire
its
the
physical
evidence
that
will
decide
whos
telling

tempting

if

the

most
notorious
statistic
regarding
guns
in

a
pioneering
study
of
residential
gunshot
deaths
in
king
county
washington
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
the
times
stat
is
everywhere
these
days
it
has
grown
in
media
lore
like
the
proverbial
urban
myth
it
was
inflated
by
one
pugilistic
talkshow
pundit
to
given
the
shock
value
of
the
finding
the
conclusion
of
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
nejm
study
is
remarkably
understated
the
advisability
of
keeping
firearms
in
the
home
for
protection
must
be
questioned
responsible
people
should
indeed
question
the
risks
and
benefits
of
bringing
a
firearm
into
their
home
but
what
we
need
to
know
is
this
what
exactly
are
the
risks
and
benefits
the
nejm
testimony
is
neither
the
whole
truth
about
the
benefits
nor
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
risks
further
as
with
motor
vehicles
we
want
to
know
what
control
do
we
have
over
the
risks
and
benefits
and
as
with
the
risks
of
cancer
or
heart
disease
or
auto
accidents
how
can
we
minimize
the
risks
like
raw
highway
death
tolls
the
nejm
stat
is
not
very
helpful
here
the
nejm
finding
purports
to
inform
us
but
it
is
framed
to
warn
us
off
it
is
widely
promulgated
in
the
media
as
a
scare
stat
a
misleading
halftruth
whose
very
formulation
is
calculated
to
prejudice
and
terrify
the
frightful
statistic
screams
for
itself
the
risks
far
outweigh
the
benefits
yes
what
fool
would
run
these
risks
if
your
car
were
times
more
likely
to
kill
you
a
loved
one
a
dear
friend
or
an
innocent
child
than
to
get
you
to
your
destination
should
you
not
take
the

uncritical
citation
puts
the
good
name
of
statistics
in
the
bad
company
of
lies
and
damned
lies
surely
we
can
do
better
where
lives
are
at
stake
lets
take
a
closer
look
at
this
risky
business
the
times
stat
of
the
nejm
study
is
the
product
of
dividing
the
number
of
home
intrudersaggressors
justifiably
killed
in
selfdefense
the
divisor
into
the
number
of
family
members
or
acquaintances
killed
by
a
gun
in
the
home
the
dividend
the
divisor
of
this
risk
equation
is
in
the
studys
fiveyear
sample
there
were
intruders
and
other
cases
of
selfdefense
the
dividend
is
in
the
study
there
were
accidental
deaths
criminal
homicides
and
suicides
divided
by
yields
there
were
a
total
of
gunrelated
deaths
in
king
county
between
and
so
the
study
leaves
deaths
outside
of
homes
unaccounted
the
nejms
notorious
times
statistic
is
seriously
misleading
on
six
counts
the
dividend
is
misleadingly
characterized
in
the
media
the
or
acquaintances
of
the
study
who
include
your
friendly
drug
dealers
and
neighborhood
gang
members
is
equated
to
friends
the
implication
is
that
the
offending
guns
target
and
kill
only
beloved
family
members
dear
friends
and
innocent
children
deaths
may
all
be
equally
tragic
but
the
character
and
circumstance
of
both
victims
and
killers
are
relevant
to
the
risk
these
crucial
risk
factors
are
masked
by
the
calculated
impression
that
the
death
toll
is
generated
by
witless
waltons
shooting
dear
friends
and
friendly
neighbors
this
is
criminological
hogwash
the
study
itself
does
not
distinguish
households
or
environs
populated
by
people
with
violent
criminal
or
substanceabuse
histories
where
the
risk
of
death
is
very
high
versus
households
inhabited
by
more
civil
folk
for
example
people
who
avoid
highrisk
activities
like
drug
dealing
gang
banging
and
wife
beating
where
the
risk
is
very
low
indeed
in
actuality
negligent
adults
allow
fatal
but
avoidable
accidents
and
homicides
are
perpetrated
mostly
by
people
with
histories
of
violence
or
abuse
people
who
are
identifiably
and
certifiably
at
high
risk
for
misadventure
to
ignore
these
obvious
risk
factors
in
firearm
accidents
and
homicides
is
as
misleading
as
ignoring
the
role
of
alcohol
in
vehicular
deaths
by
tautology
neither
gun
deaths
nor
vehicular
deaths
would
occur
without
firearms
or
vehicles
but
the
person
and
circumstance
of
the
gun
owner
or
driver
crucially
affect
the
risk
one
misleading
implication
of
the
way
the
nejm
stat
is
framed
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
is
much
more
likely
to
kill
than
to
protect
and
this
obscures
indeed
disregards
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
the
typical
quotation
of
this
study
unlike
larsons
attributes
fatal
agency
to
the
gun
a
gun
in
the
home
is
times
as
likely
to
kill
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
a
major
promulgator
of
the
nejm
statistic
uses
this
particular
formulation
we
can
dispense
with
the
silly
debate
about
whether
its
people
or
guns
that
accomplish
the
killing
again
by
tautology
gun
deaths
would
not
occur
without
the
guns
the
question
begged
is
how
many
deaths
would
occur
anyway
without
the
guns
in
any
case
people
are
the
deathdealing
agents
the
guns
are
their
lethal
instruments
the
moral
core
of
the
personal
risk
factors
in
gun
deaths
are
personal
responsibility
and
choice
due
care
and
responsibility
obviate
gun
accidents
human
choice
mediates
homicide
and
suicide
by
gun
or
otherwise
the
choice
to
own
a
gun
need
not
condemn
a
person
to
nejms
highrisk
pool
the
gun
does
not
create
this
risk
by
itself
people
have
a
lot
to
say
about
what
risk
they
run
with
guns
in
their
homes
for
example
graduates
of
paxton
quigleys
personal
protection
course
do
not
run
the
touted
times
risk
any
more
than
skilled
and
sober
drivers
run
the
same
risks
of
causing
or
suffering
vehicular
death
as
do
reckless
or
drunk
drivers
undiscriminating
actuarials
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
and
choice
just
as
they
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
socioeconomic
criminological
and
other
riskrelevant
factors
in
firearmrelated
death
this
is
why
we
resent
insurance
premiums
and
actuarial
consigment
to
risk
pools
whose
norms
disregard
our
individualities
fortunately
nothing
can
consign
us
to
the
nejm
risk
pool
but
our
own
lack
of
choice
or
responsibility
in
the
matter
suicide
accounts
for
of
the
deaths
by
gun
in
the
home
in
the
nejm
study
as
against
the
total
deaths
by
gun
in
king
county
including
those
outside
the
home
inhouse
suicides
are
of
the
total
death
toll
which
is
closer
to
the
roughly
proportion
found
by
other
studies
suicide
is
a
social
problem
of
a
very
different
order
from
homicide
or
accidents
the
implication
of
the
nejm
study
is
that
these
suicides
might
not
occur
without
readily
available
guns
it
is
true
that
attempted
suicide
by
gun
is
likely
to
succeed
it
is
not
obviously
true
that
the
absence
of
a
gun
would
prevent
any
or
all
of
these
suicides
this
is
widely
assumed
or
alleged
but
the
preponderance
of
research
on
guns
and
suicide
actually
shows
otherwise
that
this
is
wishful
thinking
in
all
but
a
few
truly
impulsive
cases

while

many
more
who
are
otherwise
foiled
apprehended
or
deterred
should
we
not
celebrate
let
alone
count
those
cases
where
no
human
life
is
lost
as
successful
armed
defenses
the
question
posed
to
media
that
cite
the
nejm
scare
stat
is
this
why
neglect
the
compendious
research
on
successful
armed
defense
notably
by
criminologist
gary
kleck
point
blank
guns
and
violence
in
america
aldine
de
gruyter
klecks
estimations
of
the
rate
and
risk
of
defensive
firearm
use
are
based
on
victimization
surveys
as
well
as
other
studies
the
rate
is
high
about
one
million
a
year
and
the
risk
is
good
gun
defenders
fare
better
than
anyone
either
those
who
resort
to
other
forms
of
resistance
or
those
who
do
not
resist
dividing
one
million
gun
defenses
a
year
by
annual
gun
deaths
from
selfdefense
homicides
suicides
and
accidents
yields
thus
we
can
construct
a
much
more
favorable
statistic
than
the
nejm
scare
stat
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
defend
against
assault
or
other
crime
than
to
kill
anybody
of
course
klecks
critics
belittle
the
dividend
of
this
calculation
what
is
good
news
for
gun
defenders
is
bad
news
for
gun
control
we
should
indeed
question
the
basis
and
method
of
klecks
high
estimation
of
defensive
firearm
use
as
i
have
questioned
the
nejm
statistic
clearly
the
issue
of
how
to
manage
mortal
risks
is
not
settled
by
uncritical
citation
of
statistics
one
thing
troubles
me
still
we
can
hardly
escape
the
unquestioned
nejm
scare
stat
in
our

but
we
hardly
ever
find

them
more

enough
time
days
to
come
out
i
take
it
that
when
something
happens
that
is
wrong
its
okay
if
a
bunch
of
people
say
it
is
for
instance
if
some
people
go
on
a
murderous
rampage
and
lynch
some
blacks
and
then
a
poll
is
taken
which
shows
that
the
majority
of
people
think
that
this
is
acceptable
then
does
this
mean
that
what
these
people
have
done
isnt
bad
this
is
an
example
of
mob
rule
not
a

that
ive
made
myself

on
this
make
the

points
your

over
todays
behaviour
and
what
if
im

fineyou
have
the
right
to

let

ask
you
this
are
you
outraged
over
this
tragedy
i
hope
that
you
are
your
opinions
of
david

his

not

i
know
i
am
since
batf

signed
off

demand
that

actually
they
should
both
be

why
id
be
interested
in
hearing
your
reasons
point
out
that
even
if
the
fire
was
set
by
someone
inside
of
the

it
came
as
a
direct
result
of
the
actions
of
the

the

it

i
believe
the

made

i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching

special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
i
think
it
was
he
went
into
town
fairly
often
and
was
known
to
go
jogging
this
was
even
during
the
month
period
when
he
was
being
watched
one
wonders
why
the
batf
went
ahead
when
they
had
been
warned
according
to
an
interview
with
a
batf
agent
that
the
bd
were
expecting
them
and
why
they
had
the
media
in
tow
almost
looks
like
they
wanted
to
have
a
romp
and
a
nice
show
for
the
media
and
it
all
went
to
hell
he
was
also
never
known
to
act
violently
he
has
always
surrendered
peacefully
before
but
of
course
the
warrants
were
served
peacefully
he
has
been
tried
on
the
allegations
before
and
found
not
guilty
the
justification
for
this
mess
was
he
was
alleged
to
have
purchased
worth
of
guns
and
stuff
over
an
undetermined
time
period
last
i
heard
this
is
not
a
crime
or
indication
of
one
i
know
of
an
individual
with
that
much
value
in
guns
should
he

also
one
cannot

that

is

like
the

calculate
the
value
of
a
drug
siezure
even
so
it
is
a
so
what
issue
he
wasnt
bothering
anyone
besides
the
batf
who
doesnt
like
folks
other
than
themselves
or
other
govt
people
having
any
effective
guns
and
having
an
unapproved
religeous
group
are
we
required
to
not
offend
the
batf
these
days
i
sure
hope
it
hasnt
come
to
that
my
point
is
it
does
not
add
up
we
need
an
independent
investigation
and
now
assuming
other
than
fbibatf
are
preserving
the
evidence
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
they
had
the
premisis
bugged
i
am
inclined
to
think
a
further
wait
would
have
saved
lives
one
wonders
why
they
didnt
have
emergency
gear
on
hand
when
they
moved
and
why
they
didnt
turn
on
the
water
when
a
fire
was
observed
instead
of
saying
aw
gee
there
is
no
water
why
so
long
before
the
fire
gear
even
showed
up
like
after
the
building
had
pretty
much
finished
burning
fireman
safety
isnt
that
a
decision
the
firefighters
should
be
allowed
to
make

why
didnt
the
feds
turn
it
back
on
they
sure
could
cut
it
off
quickly
enough
one
does
wonder
about
the
possibility
of
settling
scores

blaring

etc

questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in

were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet

but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
what
does
taking
responsibility
mean
you
think
she
is
going
to
be
facing
jail
time
if
the
acts
were
found
to
be
criminal
you
think
she
is
going
to
face
any
repercussions
if
the
fbibatf
are
found
to
have
acted
wrongly
i
dont
it
is
a
nice
pr
gimmick
though
i
am
not
assured
there
will
even
be
a
serious
independent
investigation
for
possible
wrongdoing
or
criminal
acts
on
the
part
of
the
batf
or
fbi
i
expect
to
hear
they
are
our
best
law
enforcement
they
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
no
way
out
of
the
question
end
of
issue
i
want
to
see
an
independent
investigation
with
full
prosecuting
and
subpoena
powers
with
felony
prosecution
where
felony
acts
are
found
fat
chance
i
bet
i
bet
the
justice
dept
will
have
an
internal
investigation
which
will
turn
up
at
most
poor

i

here
is

results

despite

telling

the

will
still

say
that
the

probably

they
either
did

youd
be

the

you
saying

the

who
became
christians
did
so

the

were

the

owned

no

i
dont

the

there
were
about
deaths
in

in
that
was

by

this
is
more
than
those

yes
there
could
be
that
low

could
influence

theyre
still
pretty
high

i
also

in

texas
only
has
liberal
gun
laws
as

as
purchasing

aside
from
that
its
probably
more
restrictive
than
most
states
as

texas
tried

rule
that

think
you

know
what
happened
the
state
was
virginia
and
the
law
passed
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on
other

that
right
only
inflicts
on
those
who
threaten

in

you

are

given
the

that

i
could
synthesize
enough
of

also

its

i
simply
dont

out
of

anyone
any

you
enact

is
only
going

the
ability

add

who
does

in

i
seriously
doubt
that

even
know

part

with

that
many
of

is
that

were

if

can

show

thanks
for
my

definitely
a
very
silly
supposition
if
you
do
not
believe
this
you
are
truly
naive
it
is
not
only
possible
it
is
easy
i
worked
in
the
broadcast
profession
at
a
network
station
in
the
late
i
know
what
im
saying
here
embarrasing
footage
is
easy
to
get
add
a
little
sinister
music
and
the
right
voiceover
and
ill
have
you
mother
agreeing
to
commit
you
you
should
at
least
view
the
whole
documentary
before
you
claim
it
as
a
source
i
would
if
i
could
the
news
show
that
showed
the
lengthy
excerpts
also
had
interviews
with
the
filmmaker
who
made
the
documentary
who
basically
confirmed
what
was
shown
in
the
excerpts
from
the
time
he
spent
at
the
compound
in
the
news
shows
were
looking
for
excerpts
which
backed
their
position
do
you
think
they
would
show
excerpts
which
disproved
their
points
i
am
not
pleased
with
the
batf
handling
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungled
it
badly
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
responsible
for
the
fire
which
started
in
two
different
places
two
places
eh
you
saw
this
or
did
the
wonderful
fbi
tell
you
this
i
saw
one
place
i
believe
that
this
was
reported
by
local
radio
reporters
on
site
a
fire
started
in
a
three
story
tower
at
the
same
time
as
the
two
story
window
shown
on
the
tv
coverage
the
reports
of
multistarts
came
solely
from
the
fbi
anyone
observing
the
fire
from
the
available
video
would
be
hard
pressed
to
see
more
than
one
point
of
fire
which
spread
across
the
compound
as
a
uniform
rate
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenty
of
camerapeople
willing
to
risk
small
arms
fire
to
get
some
good
footage
these
people
were
told
to
get
the
hell
out
of
camera
range
why
couldnt
answer
this
one
eh
this
is
the
most
important
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
cause
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mentioning
how
reagan
and
the
military
treated
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
precedent
but
decided
it
wasnt
worthy
of
discussion
if
the
news
reporter
got
shot
you
can
bet
his
family
would
sue
the
government
for
letting
him
into
the
danger
area
no
reported
has
ever
sued
the
government
for
such
a
situation
they
know
the
dangers
remember
the
batf
invited
the
initial
coverage
and
how
about
a
simple
remotecontrolled
camera
or
two
there
were
ways
to
provide
media
access
the
fbi
obviously
just
didnt
want
any
the
root
cause
of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
why
people
wouldnt
flee
a
building
that
had
numerous
exits
during
the
minutes
time
it
took
to
burn
down
or
why
didnt
they
flee
hours
earlier
when
the
tear
gas
was
first
introduced
i
can
find
no
rational
explanation
for
their
behavior
i
can
find
several
tear
gas
and
smoke
making
it
impossible
to
remove
the
barricades
flames
blocking

the

you
are

sucking

unworthy

but
apparently
true
my

only
of

so
your
opinion
is
truth
i
see
still
mastering
the
language
eh
notice
the
use
of
apparently
humans
died
yesterday
humans
who
would
not
have
died
if
the
fbi
had
not
taken
the
actions
they
did
that
is
the
undeniable
truth
i
cried
for
them
nor
would
they
have
died
if
they
had
come
out
with
their
hands
empty
that
is
undeniable
truth
no
it
is
not
it
is
possible
the
fbi
planned
for
this
to
happen
and
the
gunfire
heard
was
the
fbi
keeping
the
folks
inside
im
not
proposing
this
as
the
way
it
went
down
but
just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be
alive
today
you
can
believe
that
if
you
wish
it
is
undeniable
however
that
people
have
left
the
compound
unharmed
and
alive
earier
in
the
standoff
and
since
their
leader
was
preaching
that
they
would
have
an
apocalypse
you
can
not
say
undeniably
that
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
mass
suicide
if
the
fbi
had
simply
stayed
outside
and
waited
another
days
im
not
denying
that
at
all
but
every
day
is
another
chance
for
a
good
ending
why
push
it
mr
roby
you
are
going
to
die
anyway
why
not
today
every
moment
of
life
is
precious
my
heart
bleeds
just
as
much
as
yours
for
the
children
who
were
never
released
given
days
of
ample
opportunities
to
do
so
my
heart
also
bleeds
for
people
so
blinded
by
religious
devotion
to
not
have
the
common
sense
to
leave
the
compound
when
tanks
came
up
and
started
dropping
in
tear
gas
early
in
the
morning
my
heart
bleeds
for
no
one
you
are
the
bleeding
heart
and
im
sure
beyond
any
possible
doubt
that
you
do
not
feel
for
those
people
as
i
do
you
can
not
say
the
heartless
things
you
have
said
if
you
did
i
am
the
heartless

you
are
not
making
sense
no
you
are
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
a
flaming
liberal
who
cares
deeply
who
feels
your

you
seem
to
have
no
concern
that
someone
would
keep
children
inside
this
compound
when
they
had
days
to
let
them
out
that
sounds
pretty
heartless
to
me
you
have
continually
raised
this
issue
without
any
understanding
of
the
bonds
between
parent
and
child
it
is
not
easy
to
say
a

to
your
children
i
do

if

be

have
three
i
just
heard
on
the
news
that
some
of
the
survivors
regret
they
hadnt
stayed
in
the
inferno
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
koresh
this
makes
me
sad
and
sick
it
just
makes
me
sad
i
never
claimed
koresh
was
an
angel
you
seem
to
say
they
got
what
they
deserved
i
do
not
think
this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very
quickly
then
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
put
into
motion
themselves
they
got
what
they
wanted
what
kind
of
creature
are
you
that
you
can
believe
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
jonestown
the
sad
thing
is
the
people
inside
the
compound
were
the
authority
worshipers
and
their
only
authority
was
koreshhowell
if
these
people
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
there
would
likely
be
a
lot
more
survivors
today
koresh
preached
a
fiery
apocalypse
as
early
as
last
year
i
made
the
same
authority
worshiper
point
about
you
a
few
lines
back
and
once
again
jonestown
however
sick
it
was
was
doing
ok
until
the
authorities
showed
up
and
pushed
a
fragile
person
over
the
edge
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
i
see
the
batf
is
going
to
be
investigated
by
the
justice
dept
and
likely
by
arlen
spectre
and
congress
this
is
good
they
have
bungled
the
affair
from
the
start
we
agree
on
this
now
lets
have
your

the

the

they

the

then
ever
if
they
blast

a

then
that

they
could

blasting
and
killed
a
few
i
hope
this
is
a
joke
if
not
heres
my
response
the
batf
has
a
history
of
noknock
raids
with
poor
evidence
often
resulting
in
innocent
people
being
killed
or
suffering
injury
to
person
or
property
i
will
not
support
the
batf
until
they
clean
up
their
act
maybe
as
to
equipment
the
batf
has
damn
near
anything
it
wants
their
faults
were
in
intelligence
military
and
civilian
definitions
apply
tactics
attacking
during
daylight
methodology
the
fbi
stated
that
it
is
against
government
policy
to
assault
a
position
where
there
are
noncombatantspotential
hostages
without
attempting
negotiations
first
and
legality
the
batfs
jurisdiction
is
taxes
on
firearms
and
tobacco
they
are
a
branch
of
the
department
of
the
treasury
they
have
very
curiously
backed
away
from
their
claims
of
illegal
weaponry
to
push
the
childabuse
charges
the
batf
has
no
jurisdiction
over
nonfirearmstobacco
issues
and
the
charges
of
childabuse
had
been
investigated
in
the
past
with
no
violence
and
no
validation
this
was
a
clear
case
of
first
the
batf
then
the
fbi
having
watched
too
many
rambo
movies
my
opinion
is
that
the
agent
in
charge
should
be
charged
with
executing
an
illegal
raid
criminal
negligence
murder
civil
rights
violations
and
breaking
hisher
oath
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
us
the
warrant
should
be
unsealed
to
reveal
to
the
public
what
justification
the
batf
thought
it
had
in
committing
an
armed
assault
on
american
citizens
and
while
on
the
issue
of
investigating
this
issue
the
randy
weaver
case
and
the
johnny
lawmaster
case
should
be
investigated
for
batf
wrongdoing

fact
regardless
of

are

this

impeachment

the

i

of

even
if
they
were
claiming
to
be

the
batf
has
been
lying
from
the
beginning
we
only
had
handguns
the

showed

were

you
cant

when
you
have
the

for

we
didnt

they
had
guns
that
would
shoot
through

this
one
is
the
best
there
are
very
few
guns
that
wont
shoot
through
a
household
door
or
through
a
house
wall
for
that
matter
since
officers
from
the
bureau
of

should
know
that
they
are
either
lying

incredibly
incompetent
not

outrageous

quite
possible
the
problem
with
the

entity
doing
it
is
that
it
requires
everybody
involved
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
while
they
tended
to
behave
like
total
idiots
that
does
not

to

i
can
believe
that
a
real
nutcase
like
a
koresh
would
start
such
a
fire
but
im
far
from
convinced

il
they

banning

is
there
any
way
to
get
around
this
provision
why
dont
you
call
the
city
and
ask
oak
park
also
has
an
illegal
handgun
ban
as
well
but
does
allow
those
with
a
collectors
ffl
to
possess
collectible
handguns
what
would
the
penalty
if
you
were
found
out
be
probably
a
fine
in
practical
terms
what
if
you
used
said
handgun
in
a
defensive
shooting
in
your
apartment
there
how
would
the
city
law
apply
to
your
impending
trial
for
the
shooting
it
wouldnt
impede
your
defense
at
all
there
was
an
actual
incident
in
oak
park
where
a
gas
station
owner
engaged
in
a
shootout
with
a
handgun
the
grand
jury
decided
not
to
presecute
on
the
other
hand
a
black
man
used
an
illegally
owned
handgun
in
oak
park
to
defend
himself
and
the
village
tried
to
make
an
example
out
of
him
an
nra
director
who
lived
there
made
a
stink
about
this
and
it
was
decided
not
to
charge
the
guy
of
course
pissing
off
antigun
police
thugs
has
its
own
drawbacks
like
when
the
oak
park
police
chief
came
to
his
house
and
told
him
this
is
stepping
over
the
line
this
could
get
dangerous
for
you
whereupon
the
few
black
oak
park
police
officers
watched
over
his
house
to
ensure
that
the
white
antigun
police
chief
and
his
antigun
cronies
wouldnt
fck
with
him
his
home
or
family
also
what

short

what

that

a

ie
colt

cipriani
states
that

the

between
an

which
i
believe
is
in
the
any
other
weapon
category
and
a
chopped

hk

for
sure
is
not
clear
to
me
one

the

there

the
two

with
are
and
there
are
subdirectories

those
are

your

run
the

you

get

after
the

kbytess
you

you

you
can
use
the
mget
command
to
retreive
multiple
files
if
the
file
you

is
in
a
subdirectory
for
example
you
should
change
your
directory
to
the
appropriate
subdirectory
first
and
then
retrieve
it
cd
get
once
youre
finished
you
can
log
off
with
the
command
quit
if
you
have
a
file
you
want
to
contribute
the
procedure
is
a
little
different
first
of
all
you
should
find
out
if
the
file
already
exists
so
get
a
copy
of
the
index
file
with
the
procedure
above
and
look
it
over
to
make
sure
you
wouldnt
repeat
an
entry
the
index
will
have
a
description
of

of
the

once
youve

you
wont

duplicating
an

login
and
change
to
the
incoming

command
see
above
once
you
are
in
the
incoming

use
the

put

in
this
case
put

therell
be
a

complete
so
many
bytes
transfered
in
so
many
seconds
message
now
your
file
is
on
the
archive
machine
another
thing
to
watch
out
for
is
duplicate
file
names
be
sure
there
isnt
a
file
in
the
incoming
directory
that
is
called
the
same
as
the
file
you
want
to
write
if
you
use
the
same
name
youll
overwrite
the
previous
file
or
youll
get
an
error
message
your
file
may
have
to
be
renamed
if
there
is
a
conflict
with
a
file
by
the
same
name
in
the
rkba
directory
once
your
file
is
in
the
incoming
directory
send
me
an
entry
for
the
index
file
and
i
will
add
it
to
the
file
if
you
cannot
use
anonymous
ftp
and
would
still
like
to
contribute
a
file
email
the
file
to
me
and
ill
take
care
of
the
rest
if
you
submit
a
file
and
do
not
notify
me
it
may
be
removed
so
be
sure
to
let
me
know

re
riddle
me
this
on
the
subject
of
cscntear
gas
when
i
received
my
initial
introduction
to
tear
gas
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
the
location
of
the
exit
if
there
had
been
anything
in
the
way
corners
to
negotiate
doors
to
open
or
any
other
obstacles
to
movement
i
would
have
had
a
difficult
time
exiting
the
chamber
and
any
concentration
of
tear
gas
is
hazardous
to
individuals
with
respiratory
problems
and
the
wearing
of
soft
contact
lenses
in
a
tear
gas
contaminated
area
is
considered
a
real
bad
idea
so
hoping
the
bds
would
peaceably
come
strolling
out
the
door
after
being
gassed
is
a
bit
unrealistic
if
they
could
have
found
the
door
having
them
staggering
out
retching
wouldnt
be
too
far
fetched
throw
in
the
factor
of
days
of
being
under
siege
and
subject
to
psychological
warfare

all
bets

functional
abilities

donald

newcomb
writes
first
i
would
like
to
say
how
much
i
appreciate
having
so
literate
and
erudite
an
individual
as
mr
rutledge
with
whom
to
discuss
this
topic
frankly
most
antirkba
posters
refuse
even
to
approach
the
topic
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
detailed
in
the
writings
of
the
era
this
is
most
refreshing
second
i
must
apologize
for
leaving
the
discussion
for
several
days
my
brigades
quarterly
drill
was
this
weekend
and
i
needed
to
attend
to
several
matters
pertaining
to
the
state
militia
some
people
seem
to
feel
that
the
concept
of
the
militia
is
an
anachro
nism
that
is
out
of
place
in
the
century
im
not
sure
the
swiss
would
agree
and
i
think
perhaps
a
discussion
of
how
the
militia
both
organized
and
unorganized
fits
into
the
defense
plans
of
my
state
mississippi
please
do
not
assume
that
this
describes
something
peculiar
to
one
southern
state
for
instance
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
a
well
organized
militia
which
members
report
maintains
stocks
of
both
riot
guns
and
machine
guns
the
laws
of
other
states
will
vary
but
are
probably
similar
it
appears
it
is
time
that
this
article
originally
posted
by
larry
cipriani
last
year
and
which
i
saved
gets
posted
again
it
offers
as
good
an
analysis
of
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
especially
regarding
the
militia
clause
as
i
have
seen
i
have
not

any

article
the
unabridged
second

by
j
neil
schulman
if
you
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
big
bang
youd
ring
up
carl
sagan
right
and
if
you
wanted
to
know
about
desert
warfare
the
man
to
call
would
be
norman
schwarzkopf
no
question
about
it
but
who
would
you
call
if
you
wanted
the
top
expert
on
american
usage
to
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
that
was
the
question
i
asked
ac
brocki
editorial
coordinator
of
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
and
formerly
senior
editor
at
houghton
mifflin
publishers
who
himself
had
been
recommended
to
me
as
the
foremost
expert
on
english
usage
in
the
los
angeles
school
system
mr
brocki
told
me
to
get
in
touch
with
roy
copperud
a
retired
professor
journalism
at
the
university
of
southern
california
and
the
author
of
american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
a
little
research
lent
support
to
brockis
opinion
of
professor
copperuds
expertise
roy
copperud
was
a
newspaper
writer
on
major
dailies
for
over
three
decades
before
embarking
on
a
a
distinguished
career
teaching
journalism
at
usc
since
copperud
has
been
writing
a
column
dealing
with
the
professional
aspects
of
journalism
for
editor
and
publisher
a
weekly
magazine
focusing
on
the
journalism
field
hes
on
the
usage
panel
of
the
american
heritage
dictionary
and
merriam
websters
usage
dictionary
frequently
cites
him
as
an
expert
copperuds
fifth
book
on
usage
american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
has
been
in
continuous
print
from
van
nostrand
reinhold
since
and
is
the
winner
of
the
association
of
american
publishers
humanities
award
that
sounds
like
an
expert
to
me
after
a
brief
telephone
call
to
professor
copperud
in
which
i
introduced
myself
but
did
not
give
him
any
indication
of
why
i
was
interested
i
sent
the
following
letter
i
am
writing
you
to
ask
you
for
your
professional
opinion
as
an
expert
in
english
usage
to
analyze
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
extract
the
intent
from
the
text
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
is
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
for
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
the
debate
over
this
amendment
has
been
whether
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
restrictive
clause
or
a
subordinate
clause
with
respect
to
the
independent
clause
containing
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
i
would
request
that
your
analysis
of
this
sentence
not
take
into
consideration
issues
of
political
impact
or
public
policy
but
be
restricted
entirely
to
a
linguistic
analysis
of
its
meaning
and
intent
further
since
your
professional
analysis
will
likely
become
part
of
litigation
regarding
the
consequences
of
the
second
amendment
i
ask
that
whatever
analysis
you
make
be
a
professional
opinion
that
you
would
be
willing
to
stand
behind
with
your
reputation
and
even
be
willing
to
testify
under
oath
to
support
if
necessary
my
letter
framed
several
questions
about
the
test
of
the
second
amendment
then
concluded
i
realize
that
i
am
asking
you
to
take
on
a
major
responsibility
and
task
with
this
letter
i
am
doing
so
because
as
a
citizen
i
believe
it
is
vitally
important
to
extract
the
actual
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
while
i
ask
that
your
analysis
not
be
affected
by
the
political
importance
of
its
results
i
ask
that
you
do
this
because
of
that
importance
after
several
more
letters
and
phone
calls
in
which
we
discussed
terms
for
his
doing
such
an
analysis
but
in
which
we
never
discussed
either
of
our
opinions
regarding
the
second
amendment
gun
control
or
any
other
political
subject
professor
copperud
sent
me
the
follow
analysis
into
which
i
have
inserted
my
questions
for
the
sake
of
clarity
copperud
the
words
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
contrary
to
the
interpretation
cited
in
your
letter
of
july
constitutes
a
present
participle
rather
than
a
clause
it
is
used
as
an
adjective
modifying
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
subject
the
right
verb
shall
the
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
asserted
as
an
essential
for
maintaining
a
militia
in
reply
to
your
numbered
questions
schulman
can
the
sentence
be
interpreted
to
grant
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
solely
to
a
wellregulated
militia
copperud
the
sentence
does
not
restrict
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
nor
does
it
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
elsewhere
or
by
others
than
the
people
it
simply
makes
a
positive
statement
with
respect
to
a
right
of
the
people
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
granted
by
the
words
of
the
second
amendment
or
does
the
second
amendment
assume
a
preexisting
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
merely
state
that
such
right
shall
not
be
infringed
copperud
the
right
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
its
existence
is
assumed
the
thrust
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
right
shall
be
preserved
inviolate
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
a
militia
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
conditioned
upon
whether
or

does

grant
a

or
is

the

copperud
the
right
is
assumed
to
exist
and
to
be
unconditional
as
previously
stated
it
is
invoked
here
specifically
for
the
sake
of
the
militia
schulman
which
of
the
following
does
the
phrase
wellregulated
militia
mean
wellequipped
wellorganized
welldrilled
welleducated
or
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
copperud
the
phrase
means
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
this
accords
with
the
desire
of
the
writers
for
civilian
control
over
the
military
schulman
if
at
all
possible
i
would
ask
you
to
take
account
the
changed
meanings
of
words
or
usage
since
that
sentence
was
written
years
ago
but
not
take
into
account
historical
interpretations
of
the
intents
of
the
authors
unless
those
issues
can
be
clearly
separated
copperud
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
words
or
in
usage
that
would
affect
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
if
it
were
written
today
it
might
be
put
since
a
wellregulated
militia
is
necessary
tot
he
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
abridged
schulman
as
a
scientific
control
on
this
analysis
i
would
also
appreciate
it
if
you
could
compare
your
analysis
of
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
following
sentence
a
wellschooled
electorate
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
shall
not
be
infringed
my
questions
for
the
usage
analysis
of
this
sentence
would
be
is
the
grammatical
structure
and
usage
of
this
sentence
and
the
way
the
words
modify
each
other
identical
to
the
second
amendments
sentence
and
could
this
sentence
be
interpreted
to
restrict
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
only
to
a
welleducated
electorate
for
example
registered
voters
with
a
highschool
diploma
copperud
your
scientific
control
sentence
precisely
parallels
the
amendment
in
grammatical
structure
there
is
nothing
in
your
sentence
that
either
indicates
or
implies
the
possibility
of
a
restricted
interpretation
professor
copperud
had
only
one
additional
comment
which
he
placed
in
his
cover
letter
with
wellknown
human
curiosity
i
made
some
speculative
efforts
to
decide
how
the
material
might
be
used
but
was
unable
to
reach
any
conclusion
so
now
we
have
been
told
by
one
of
the
top
experts
on
american
usage
what
many
knew
all
along
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unconditionally
protects
the
peoples
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
forbidding
all
governments
formed
under
the
constitution
from
abridging
that
right
as
i
write
this
the
attempted
coup
against
constitutional
government
in
the
soviet
union
has
failed
apparently
because
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
be
free
from
capricious
tyranny
is
stronger
than
the
old
guards
desire
to
maintain
a
monopoly
on
dictatorial
power
and
here
in
the
united
states
elected
lawmakers
judges
and
appointed
officials
who
are
pledged
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
ignore
marginalize
or
prevaricate
about
the
second
amendment
routinely
american
citizens
are
put
in
american
prisons
for
carrying
arms
owning
arms
of
forbidden
sorts
or
failing
to
satisfy
bureaucratic
requirements
regarding
the
owning
and
carrying
of
firearms
all
of
which
is
an
abridgement
of
the
unconditional
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
even
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
staunch
defender
of
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
stands
by
and
does
nothing
it
seems
it
is
up
to
those
who
believe
in
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
preserve
that
right
no
one
else
will
no
one
else
can
will
we
beg
our
elected
representatives
not
to
take
away
our
rights
and
continue
regarding
them
as
representing
us
if
they
do
will
we
continue
obeying
judges
who
decide
that
the
second
amendment
doesnt
mean
what
it
says
it
means
but
means
whatever
they
say
it
means
in
their
orwellian
doublespeak
or
will
be
simply
keep
and
bear
the
arms
of
our
choice
as
the
constitution
of
the
united

promises
us
we
can
and
pledge
that
we
will
defend
that
promise

the

we

this

most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
known
criminals
can
not
buy

thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
same
here
convicted
felons
may
not
legally
purchase
firearms
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
that
you
know
of
while
i
lived
in
the

a
gang
robbed
a
joint
us
armybundewehr
armoury
and
got
several
hundred
ammunition
handguns
and
some
explosives
when
i
left
two
years
later
there
were
no
clues
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
someone
said
that
if
we
ban
guns
wed
have
to
ban
cars
to
because
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argue
on
this
one
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
who
uses
them
is
the
problem
crime
in
the
us
is
no
big
deal
if
you
are
the
criminal
how
about
years
for
murder
credit
for
time
served
in
jail
waiting
for
trial
and
you
are
out
in
months
worst
case
if
we
would
put
criminals
especially
violent
ones
in
the
slam
for
true
sentences
crime
would
drop
instead
we
reward
them
for
being
good
and
let
them
out
early
very
early
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
serbs
croats
and
muslims
have
been
killing
each
other
almost
since
before
the
invention
of
guns
old
women
are
throwing
stones
at
un
trucks
this
is
a
hatred
that
goes
beyond
reason
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
yes
the
problem
is
the
user
question
back
since
you
are
one
of
the
rational
ones
if
all
gun
crime
were
to
stop
would
you
support
dropping
all
gun
controls
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
they
did
not
believe
from
experience
that
the
police
including
national
guard
couldwould
protect
them
unless
you
want
to
argue
that
a
human
being
does
not
have
a
right
to
protect
himherself
they
did
the
right
thing
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
defense
against
a
mob
throwing
bottles
and
rocks
and
also
likely
armed
with
stolen
firearms
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
criminals
would
move
to
scandinavia
the
average
criminal
would
look
for
a
less
hazardous
job
and
the
rest
would
likely
be
buried
at
county
expense
dont
flame
the
englishmen
because
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
works
in
england
and
fonds
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reasons
why
ira
can
bomb
innocents
something
about
throwing
stones
in
glass
houses
personally
i
criticize
the
fools
who
send
money
to
the
ira
to
make
ireland
free
of
course
this
is
the
last
thing
the
ira
wants
because
they
lose
power
if
england
pulls
out
but
thats
for
another
group
dont
flame
them
because
of
what
to
three
children
did
either

an

have
an
oppinion
on
guns
or
even
peace
yes
yes
the
question
is
is
the
problem
one
of
too
many
guns
mostly
from
the
army
or
not
enough
nonserbians
can
not
defend

no

i

i
should
have
also
included

in
my

to

if
hed
ask
how
to
distinguish

from

lets
do
the
former
now
kratz
has
claimed
that
he
can
visually
distinguish
fullautos
from
semiautos
for
which
fullautos
is
he
making
that
claim
how
does
he
do
it
lets
get
specific
and
as
exhaustive
as
possible
maybe
i
remember
there
being
a
selector
swtich
on

if
i
remember
correctly
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
position
or
an
on
position
because
the
gun
is
semiautomatic
wouldnt
the
have
a
position
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
maybe
round
bursts
maybe
why
is
kratz
asking
about
what
he
told
us
that
he
knows
is
kratz
certain
that
he
can
distinguish
a
three
position
switch
from
a
two
position
switch
via
tv
inspection
does
he
even
get
to
see
the
switch
in
the
typical
police
display
of

note
that
one
might
well
be
able
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
in
a

on
visual
inspection
even
though
it
wont
be
seen
on

and
to
think
that
kratz
was
telling
us
that
seeing
it
on
tv
was
just
as
accurate
as
being
there
how
about
the
other

do
they
also
have

to

based

was

tha
there
is
no

of

hopefully
if
there
is
any

it
may
prevent
injuries

in

of
these
types

incidents
if
youre
a

in

then
perhaps
you
can
comment
for
us
on
the
ratio
of
the
accidental

death
rate
to
the
rate
of
accidental
death
from
other
single
causes
follow
that
perhaps
with
some
sort
of
justification
for
the
amount
of
effort
that
antigunners
spend
trying
to
convince
the
country
that
accidental
gunrelated
death
among
children
in
the
us
is
a
serious
problem
firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
any
death
is
serious
wanna
discuss
match
control
firearms
related
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
negligent
persons
not
the
gun
did
i
say
that
a
child
who
unintentionally
shoots
someone
is
not
negligent
no
i
hate
to
repeat
myself
jim
but
like
i
told
joe
i
was
not
attempting
in
any
way
to
justify
gun
control
youre
right
any
death
is
serious
that
was
my
point
to
joe
who
said
that
antigunners
try
to
convinve
the
country
that
accidental
gun
deaths
related
to
children
are
a
serious
problem
i
guess
i
assumed
everyone
thought
that
it
was
a

no
i
dont
want
to

i
dont
equate
a

dont

dont

tired

line
guns
dont

people
kill

sure
people
can

people

gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
providing
false
hope
then
is
the
intent
jim
im
just
saying
how
it
is
im
not
saying
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
from
the
police
who
i
have
talked
with
who
run
some
of
these
gun
buyback
programs
i
get
the
impression
that
they
really
think
they
are
having
an
impact
on
the
community
when
i
ask
them
if
they
have
an
evaluatory
component
to
the
program
they
say
well
no
so
in
answer
to
your
question
no
false
hope
is
not
the
intent
i
think
the
intent
is
to
show
folks
that
police
are
attempting
to
do
something
to
curb
interpersonal
gun
violence
whether
its
effective
or
not
look
if
you
cant
measure
the
impact
of
these
programs
using
some
sort
of
pretest
and
posttest
evaluation
what
is
the
point
it
must
be
symbolic
in
nature
the
police
are
essentially
saying
look
if
you
have
a
gun
lying
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for
itbecause
we
care
about
the
community
if
you
i
and
joe
could
think
of
a
way
to
measure
the
effectiveness
or
ineffectiveness
of
these
programs
we
could
become
rich
and
famous
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in
schools

amd
these
are
the
statistics
increase
in
california

eh
gun
control
is
working
fine
there
i
didnt
anything
about
gun
control
what
are
you
talking
about
thus
willing
to
follow
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive
thanks
for
the
reality
check
joe
its
been
real
so
your
religion
is
different
does
that
make
it
his
wrong
even
assuming
koresh
actually
made
that
decision
and
the
verdict
is
still
out
on
that
jim
listen
to
me
i
said
im
not
religious
whatsoever
do
you
understand
religion
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
could
care
less
what
religion
they
were
okay
to
put
children
in
that
situation
is
wrong
pure
and
simple
difference
is
good
jim
i
am

diverse

it
is

therefore
a

could

into

why
didnt

immediately
retreat
from

to

than

normal
person
rather
than
using
techniques
aimed
at
placing
the

occupants
into
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
reports
indicate
several
of
the
children
inside
the
complex
were
accompanied
by
their
mothers
since
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
these
mothers
would
have
their
children
taken
away
from
them
if
they
came
out
why
did
the
fbi
expect
the
mothers
to
just
walk
out
and
surrender
themselves
to
the
authorities
agents
at
the
scene
claim
to
have
seen
members
of
the
branch
davidians
setting
fire
to
the
complex
branch
davidian
members
who
survived
the
inferno
claim
the
fire
was
started
when
an
armored
vehicle
punched
through
the
wall
and
knocked
over
a
lantern
which
was
setting
on
a
table
video
tape
of
the
incident
does
show
an
armored
vehicle
punching
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
fire
erupted
almost
immediately
from
the
same
general
location
was
the
source
of
the
fire
the
same
room
where
the
armored
vehicle
penetrated
fbi
spokesmen
are
voicing
the
opinion
that
the
david
koresh
and
the
members
of
the
branch
davidians
committed
mass
suicide
yet
bodies
are
being
discovered
throughout
the
house
and
other
areas
within
the
building
complex
this
seems
to
be
counter
to
any
known
mass
suicides
through
history
what
evidence
does
the
fbi
have
that
a
mass
suicide
pact
existed
fbi
director
sessions
stated
that
the
massive
fireball
shown
on
the
video
tape
was
caused
by
the
branch
davidians
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
exploding
yet
the
fireball
seems
to
be
more
characteristic
of
the
type
created
when
compressed
gas
or
other
highly
volatile
fuel
source
explodes
was
any
evidence
found
which
would
indicate
the
branch
davidians
had
an
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
which
exploded
to
create
this
fireball
if
so
and
if
david
koresh
and
members
of
the
branch
davidians
were
engaged
in
the
legal
business
of
sellingbuying
firearms
was
the
amount
determined
to
be
excessively
greater
than
one
would
expect
for
someone
engaged
in
such
a
legal
business
it
is
rumored
that
one
fbi
agent
was
extremely
upset
about
critical
news
media
coverage
and
intentionally
used
an
armored
vehicle
to
crush
a
reporters
car
which
had
been
left
at
the
compound
is
there
any
factual
basis
to
this
rumor
and
if
so
what
charges
will
be
brought
against
the
fbi
agent
who
performed
the
act
fbi
director
sessions
states
that
during
the
final
assault
on
the
complex
over
shots
were
fired
at
the
vehicles
on
the
video
tape
of
the
incident
you
can
hear
the
drone
of
the
armored
vehicles
engines
yet
there
is
no
sound
of
the
sharp
reports
that
one
would
expect
to
hear
if
shots
were
fired
also
there
are
no
indications
of
smoke
andor
muzzle
flashes
appearing
from
the
windows
buildings
or
other
structures
in
the
video
surely
these
should
be
evident
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
on
the
armored
vehicles
finally
the
video
tape
does
not
show
any
indication
of
paint
splatter
sparks
or
other
characteristic
spray
of
material
which
should
be
apparent
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
upon
the
vehicles
do
any
of
the
armored
vehicles
which
were
brought
in
to
pump
tear
gas
into
the
compound
show
evidence
of
fresh
damage
due
to
being
hit
by
shots
from
highpower
rifles
cs
gas
is
considered
to
be
a
chemical
warfare
agent
the
united
states
has
signed
international
treaties
which
prevent
the
use
of
cs
gas
in
warfare
if
the
united
states
could
not
morally
use
cs
gas
against
saddam
hussein
and
his
troops
why
is
it
morally
acceptable
to
use
the
same
agent
against
citizens
of
our
own
land
on
april
fbi
spokesmen
state
that
at
least
bodies
discovered
in
the
complex
had
bullet
wounds
to
the
head
indicating
they
had
been
murdered
or
had
committed
suicide
on

the
county
coroner
claims
he
knows
nothing
about

found

any
of

vernon
the
real

one
at

the
one
that
lost
his
cool
was
vernon
so
i
figured
that
he
was
more
likely
to
do
it
after
all
he
was
jesus
being
persecuted
by
the

and
had

to

made
the
decision
he
and
his

also
probably
felt

thsi
conclusion

re
jffo
has
gone
a
bit
too
far
having
read
the
posted
long
article
by
jpfo
i
have
some
observations
this
article
does
not
claim
that
the
gca
of
is
a
verbatim
translation
of
a
nazi
law
what
it
says
is
that
in
another
place
the
book
theyre
talking
about
they
compare
the
two
things
section
by
section
the
implication
is
that
the
similarities
are
devastating
in
the
next
sentence
they
talk
about
how
in
that
book
they
reproduce
the
german
text
of
the
nazi
law
together
with
its
translation
not
surprisingly
a
reader
could
easily
conflate
these
two
things
into
a
single
idea
that
the
american
gca
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
nazi
law
and
sure
enough
thats
what
the
whole
thing
has
mutated
into
urbanfolklore
style
the
article
goes
to
great
pains
to
establish
that
senator
dodd
had
a
copy
of
the
nazi
law
either
from
his
time
on
the
nurnberg
prosecution
team
or
later
this
fact
is
considered
highly
incriminating
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
author
repeats
several
times
that
he
is
simply
unable
to
imagine
how
anyone
could
come
into
possession
of
the
original
text
and
yet
in
a
paragraph
towards
the
end
he
explains
it
perfectly
if
dodd
got
his
copy
of
the
original
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
during
his
time
at
nurnberg
it
likely
was
part
of
a
collection
of
documents
for
example
issues
of
the
reichsgesetzblatt
the
german
law
registry
bingo
exactly
dodd
had
a
book
with
a
series
of
nazi
laws
in
it
including
the
one
under
discussion
all
of
the
stuff
about
why
would
a
us
congressman
have
a
copy
of
a
nazi
law
melts
away
by
the
authors
admission
he
then
continues
but
if
he
acquired
the
original
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
after
his
service
at
nurnberg
he
must
have
done
so
for
a
very
specific
reason
but
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
think
that
this
is
the
case
in
fact
as
a
senior
member
of
the
us
team
that
helped
to
prosecute
nazi
war
criminals
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
have
had
to
have
a
copy
all
arguments
about
whether
the
nazi
weapon
law
is
really
of
historical
interest
as
it
obviously
is
certainly
according
to
the
author
here
or
whether
dodd
personally
prosecuted
the
interior
minister
who
signed
it
can
be
put
aside
as
red
herrings
having
established
that
dodd
owned
a
copy
of
the
original
german
text
the
jpfo
article
then
tries
to
draw
sinister
implications
from
the
fact
that
he
asked
to
have
it
translated
the
problem
is
in
the
context
of
the
charge
levelled
at
dodd
these
two
things
work
against
each
other
people
ask
to
have
things
translated
when
they
dont
know
what
they
mean
if
dodd
took
it
upon
himself
to
preserve
the
nazi
law
with
idea
of
someday
introducing
it
into
american
law
surely
by
he
would
have
know
what
it
meant
wouldnt
he
anyway
this
precise
charge
the
main
one
that
i
questioned
in
an
earlier
posting
is
just
silly
why
would
dodd
need
the
exact
translation
for
this
purpose
is
the
idea
that
the
gun
controllers
despite
being
presumably
bent
on
disarming
the
populace
with
the
goal
of
eventually
destroying
all
civil
liberties
needed
a
crib
sheet
didnt
they
have
any
idea
how
to
do
it
on
their
own
once
again
the
author
provides
a
perfectly
acceptable
answer
to
his
own
question
dodd
may
have
offered
his
copy
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
to
show
that
the
specific
proposal
did
not
resemble
anything
in
the
nazi
law
in
fact
since
the
law
and
its
translation
were
entered
into
the
congressional
record
under
the
heading
of
documents
concerning
the
history
of
nazism
and
gun
confiscation
dodds
motivation
isnt
a
mystery
he
asked
for
the
translation
in
order
to
put
it
in
the
cr
even
this
article
makes
it
clear
that
the
part
of
the
nazi
law
that
was
added
by
the
nazi
regime
is
only
a
small
part
of
that
law
registration
of
guns
for
instance
was
begun
in
and
thus
not
a
naziinspired
idea
the
parts
of
the
nazi
law
that
parallel
the
gca
include
handgun
control
of
some
sort
and
the
identification
of
certain
weapons
as
sporting
weapons
the
jpfo
then
goes
on
to
list
other
parts
of
the
nazi
law
forbidding
ownership
of
weapons
by
jews
of
course
there
are
no
such
provisions
in
the
american
gca
nevertheless
in
a
rhetorical
move
guaranteed
to
muddy
the
waters
immediately
after
the
discussion
of
the
antijewish
parts
of
the
law
the
jpfo
article
continues
given
the
parallels
between
the
nazi
weapons
law
and
the
so
as
to
get
maximum
emotional
mileage

i
think
wed
all
be

the
problem
is
the
methods
were
using
now
dont
do
the
trick
dont
manufacture

dont

dont

some

will
get

fewer

of

hunting

could
be
allowed

as
long
as
they

how
many

can
you
shoot

anyways
one
assumes
they
are
moving
first
of
all
lets
assume
that
you
are
right
that
fewer
guns
would
make
it
in
to
the
country
that
sounds
great
to
those
that
see
guns
as
inherently
evil
except
then
every
one
of
those
guns
would
be
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
obviously
couldnt
care
less
about
following
the
law
after
all
they
got
the
gun
illegally
so
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
with
that
gun
great
then
everyone
with
a
gun
is
likely
to
use
it
in
a
crime
nice
system
now
as
to
reducing
the
number
of
guns
coming
into
society
by
making
it
illegal
to
manufacture
sell
or
import
them
in
this
coutry
let
me
use
a
parallel
for
empiric
evidence
the
amount
of
cocaine
in
this
country
is
far
less
since
its
manufacture
sale
and
importation
was
out

i

how
about
no

if
there
is
no

against
with
just
whats
to
stop
a
person
with
a
clean
record
from
buying
guns
grinding
off
the
serial
numbers
and
selling
them
to
crooks
at
minimum
what
additional
laws
are
needed
to
prevent
this
it
is
already
illegal
to
do
this
seems
at
min
a

if

wouldnt

fbi

hello
i
just
want
to
make
points
the
fbi
is
not
stupid
these
people
are
chosen
for
their
intelligence
education
loyalty
to
the
government
etc
they
are
given
much
intensive
training
so
to
all
of
you
who
refuse
to
believe
there
could
be
any
conspiracy
here
and
say
that
the
fbi
was
just
stupid
i
say
i
dont
believe
it
the
fbi
has
acces
to
the
latest
in
audio
and
video
technology
the
latest
digital
systems
the
fbi
can
manufacture
evidence
need
a
tape
of
koresh
saying
light
the
fire
and
you
can
have
one
need
a
thermal
imaging
video
of
three
people
lighting
fires
and
through
the
magic
of
computer
graphics
you
can
have
one
the
thing
is
manufacturing
these
pieces
of
evidence
takes
time
so
it
may
be
a
few
more
days
before
we
get
to
see
them
or
maybe
we
just
havent
heard
any
tapes
or
seen
any

is

it

of

he
claimed
that
the

started
when
the

caused
an

to
collapse
knocking
over
kerosene

and
that
they
had

the

why
didnt

i
dont

why
this
is
the
ap
story
from
fri
morning
as
the
walls
came
tumbling
down
and
tear
gas
filled
the
air
cult
leader
david
koresh
sprang
into
action
he
left
his
thirdfloor
bedroom
and
began
looking
around
the
house
making
sure
women
and
children
were
secure
and
checking
that
everyone
had
their
gas
masks
on
properly
within
hours
the
compound
became
an
inferno
nine
branch
davidians
excaped
this
is
their
story
gleaned
from
lawyers
who
spoke
with
six
of
them
who
are
jailed
on
charges
that
include
conspiracy
and
murder
that
day
the
six
said
a
portable
radio
offered
the
only
contact
with
the
outside
world
since
koreshs
righthand
man
steve
schneider
ripped
out
the
compoundss
phone
line
after
fbi
agents
called
before
dawn
monday
saying
this
was
the
cults
last
chance
come
out
or
prepare
to
get
forced
out
they
kept
their
word
by
dawn
tanks
were
battering
the
mount
carmel
compound
punching
for
hours
to
creat
holes
for
tear
gas
to
enter
the
bd
meanwhile
proceeded
with
their
daily
routines
strapped
into
gas
masks
the
women
did
laundry
others
read
bibles
in
their
rooms
the
children
all
under
remained
by
their
mothers
sides
still
it
was
hard
to
ignore
what
was
happening
around
them
each
time
a
tank
rammed
the
poorlyconstructed
building
it
shook
violently
cult
members
dodges
falling
gypsum
wallboard
and
doors
hundreds
of
gas
canisters
hurled
in
from
the
armored
vehicles
were
filling
the
air
with
noxious
fumes
the
flying
canisters
were
more
frightening
than
the
tanks
at
least
one
man
was
hit
in
the
face
the
gas
began
filling
the
air
driven
by
heavy
gusts
of
wind
coming
through
windows
and
the
holes
the
tanks
made
scattered
throughout
the
house
the
cult
members
made
no
efforts
to
gather
then
the
fbi
sent
in
its
biggest
weapon
a
massive
armored
vehicle
headed
for
a
chamber
lined
with
cinder
blocks
where
authorities
hoped
to
find
koresh
and
schneider
and
fire
tear
gas
directly
at
them
here
the
cult
members
story
diverges
from
the
governments
version
the
fbi
says
cult
members
set
fires
in
three
places
but
each
of
the
six
cult
members
in
separate
discussions
with
lawyers
consistently
gave
versions
at
odds
with
the
fbis
account
they
say
the
tank
flattened
a
barrel
of
propane
spilling
its
contents
and
as
the
tank
thundered
through
the
house
it
tipped
over
lit
lanterns
spitting
flames
that
ignited
the
propane
and
other
flammables
the
home
of
used
lumber
plywood
and
wallboard
tacked
together
with
tar
paper
was
vulnerable
the

nine

hey
guys
youre
absolutely
correct
and
well
on
the
way
to
winning
this
battle

losing

yes
there
are
serious
philosophical

in

ones
too
howd
you
like
to
sue
the

lose
and
have
to
pay
their
reasonable

still
i
have
one
basic
question
compared
to
what
weve
got
is
hr
a
better
or
b
worse
this
one
shouldnt
even
take
you
three
guesses
compared
to
the
second
amendment
i
think
its
worse
the
problem
is
the
devil
is
in
the
details
you
know
the
brady
bill
sounds
like
a
good
idea
too
until
you
discover
that
there
is
no
check
and
that
the
police
dont
have
to
allow
your
purchase
even
if
you
check
out
and
that
you
have
no
recourse
if
they
dont
are
there
any
loopholes
here
im
no
lawyer
i
cant
be
sure
i
would
have
never
noticed
the
second
one
mentioned
above
in
the
brady
bill
for
example
the
more
words
involved
the
more
details
what
was
that
saying
about
abraham
lincoln
requiring
words
to
free
the
slaves
and
the
modern
congress
requiring
words
to
describe
price
controls
on
rice
if
theres
a
good
enough
show
of
support
for
hr
maybe
for
a
change
we
could
be
the
ones
saying
its
a

independent

are
able
to
come
to
either
conclusion
depending
on
the

noncritical
thinkers
are
the
ones
who
would
always
come

regardless
of

independent
thinkers
question
authority
in
a
situation
where
only
one
set
of
facts
are
being
presented
coming
to
a
conclusion
is
not
the
hallmark
of
an
independent

unless
its
coupled
with
the
ability
to
challenge
those
facts
critically
the
scientific
method
consists
of
more

perhaps
youve

wake

i

i

some
of

tactics
after
watching

tonight
as
well

i
question
some
of

fbi
actions
right

proper
how
it
was
fubar
from

could
it
have
been
possible

have
taken
koresh
outside

some
time
before
the

yes
could
a

have
resulted

outcome
it
would
have
hurt
nothing
to
wait
and
the
result
could
hardly
have

were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers

the

course
of
action
sure
it
you
want
to
someone
you
claim
is
a

paranoid
even
more
paranoid
and
a
few
other
questions

i

i
believe
the

taken

were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet

i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to

seems
like
the

figuring

this

in

thursday

i
think
the

was
upi

dont
recall
for

it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
did

they
could
broadcast
it

it
would
resolve

at

help
to

alot

the

claiming
all

without

one

other
than
their
good

is
very
suspicious
to
me
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words
i
understand
that
at
least
two
goverment
investigations
have
been
ordered
so
we
may
learn
more
during
their
hearings
i
sincerely
hope
you
are
right
and
it
turns
out
with
indisputable
proof
broadcast
across
our
land
that
the
government
groups
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fire
but
until
i
see
such
proof
i
think
it
is
just
as
likely
that
a
tank
did
knock
over
a
lantern
as
koresh
torching
the
place
the
only
evidence
i
have

is
a

crashing
through
the

wall
withdrawing
and
seconds
later
flames
are
seen
the
first
flames
on
the
video
erupting
from
this
very
same
spot
coincidence
perhaps
tough
call
without
more
investigation
but
if
the
thermal
imaging
story
holds
up
i
think
the
government
will
be
more
credable
of
course
paranoia
fans
wont
believe
their
results
anyway
will
they
if
such
proof
exists
the
government
should
publish
it
and
put
all
this
speculation
to

also

reports

the
following
is
quoted
from
the
tail
end
of
a
rather
condescending
article
about
paxton
quigley
that
appeared
in
us
snooze
and
world
lies
sorry
i
think
it
was
in
the
wall
street
journal
and
was
repeated
in
the
colorado
peoples
daily
a
student
newspaper
at
the
university
of
colorado
at
boulder
a
study
of
residential
gunsot
deaths
in
king
county
wash
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
the
used
to
kill
is
the
heart
of
the
misinformation
its
one
of
those
technically
accurate
phrasings
that
conveys
the
wrong
impression
what
mr
quiqley
is
more
than
aware
of
im
sure
is
that
when
people
read
this
they
think
violent
arguments
where
one
member
of
the
family
grabs
a
gun
and
shoots
another
thereby
creating
a
tragic
situation
which
could
easily
have
been
avoided
had
the
gun
not
been
there
or
a
tragic
accident
especially
involving
a
child
unfortunately
thats
not
the
way
things
stack
up
the
majority
of
that
times
i
believe
are
suicides
that
is
someone
intentionally
took
a
firearm
and
shot
themselves
intending
to
kill
themselves
and
why
its
popular
to
try
and
blame
suicides
on
guns
the
evidence
doesnt
support
this
internal
studies
as
well
as
comparative
studies
with
other
countries
indicate
that
cultural
factors
far
outweigh
whether
a
person
will
kill
themselves
or
not
japan
for
instance
has
a
slightly
higher
rate
than
the
us
there
people
jump
off
buildings
according
to
the
national
crime
survey
of
violent
crime
is
commited
by
nonstrangers
which
mistakenly
has
been
generalized
regarding
the
king
county
study
to
mean
friends
and
family
that
is
mr
quigley
and
others
who
quote
this
statistic
are
banking
on
the
mental
image
that
a
friend
family
member
or
child
equates
to
a
loving
relationship
and
that
it
was
cut
short
in
a
moment
of
anger
unfortunately
all
too
often
husbands
beat
and
kill
wives
children
assault
parents
or
viceversa
most
rapes
are
commited
by
someone
known
to
the
victim
for
instance
essentially
that
a
gun
was
used
against
a
friend
or
family
member
doesnt
mean
they
werent
trying
to
hurt
the
other
person
crime
is
highest
among
poor
urban
families
and
those
are
also
the
areas
most
at
risk
for
family
problems
especially
violent
ones
a
son
in
a
gang
may
not
be
as
loving
toward
his
parents
if
they
disapprove
than
a
suburban
kid
might
finally
it
hinges
on
the
fallacy
that
a
dead
intruder
is
the
only
value
of
a
selfdefense
firearm
using
the
minimum
figures
i
worked
out
using
the
ncs
i
got
about
an
ratio
between
deadly
selfdefenses
justifiable
homicides
and
withgun
selfdefenses
between
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
and
the
ncs
theres
an
enormous
amount
of
data
and
anybody
with
the
calculator
can
crunch
the
numbers
as
such
it
is
incorrect
to
assume
that
a
dead
body
is
the
only
valid
means
of
determining
the
success
of
such
a
defense
since
according
to
the
ncs
which
has
been
considered
by
many
to
seriously
underreport
defenses
there
were
far
more
successful
withgun
defenses
than
intruders
killed
not
it
also
confines
itself
to
the
home
where
attack
by
a
friend
or
family
member
is
far
far
more
likely
and
excludes
any
defense
which
occurs
outside
the
home
i
believe
a
large
number
occur
in
businesses
studies
by
the
western
psychiatric
institute
in
pittsburgh
found
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
sharply
incresases
the
likelihood
a
family
member
will
commit
suicide
even
in
the
absence
of
psychiatric
illness
i
have
not
seen
the
exact
data
for
this
so
i
cant
comment
i
will
point
out
canadas
and
japans
suicide
rate
as
indications
that
culture
far
more
than
firearm
availability
affect
suicide
rates
there
was
also
a
comparative
study
between
canada
for
what
its
worth
considering
the
difficulty
of
comparing
across
cultural
lines
published
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
i
can
get
the
exact
cite
if
you
need
it
that
concluded
that
restrictive
firearm
laws
would
not
significantly
impact
the
overall
suicide

andy

says
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safety
is
supposed
to
do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
what
i
safety
is
supposed
to
do
kratz
comments
above
show
otherwise
its
basic
purpose
not
to
let
the
gun
fire
until
youre
ready
bingo
now
the
question
is
does
the
glocks
qualify
lets
see
the
evidence
that
kratz
uses
christ
ive
known
that
since
i
had
my
first
crosman
air
gun
you
dont
know
me
so
dont
make
assumptions
about
what
i
know
and
dont
know
but
first
an
aside
having
an
air
gun
proves
nothing
moreover
my
comments
are
based
on
what
kratz
writes
hes
free
to
argue
that
he
babbles
in
text
but
actually
knows
something
offline
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the
gun
from
going
off
unless
thats
what
the
user
wants
with
glocks
one
says
i
want
the
gun
to
go
off
by
pulling
the
trigger
if
the
safeties
it
has
make
that
work
it
has
a
real
safety
no
matter
what
kratz
thinks
from
the
things
i
have
readheard
glocks
are
always
knocked
because
of
the
trigger
safety
they
are
supposedly
harder
to
learn
to
use
properly
harder
than
what
i
note
that
almost
all
revolvers
work
the
same
way
so
it
cant
be
harder
than
revolvers
every
article
that
i
have
read
cant
be
wrong
about
the
damn
thing
sure
they
can
moreover
we
know
now
that
kratz
sample
is
unrepresentative
we
can
look
at
the
reasoning
it
is
basically
these
glocks
are
dangerous
because
theyre
not
like
my
third
generation
part
of
that
is
true
but
since
those
same
people
dont
claim
that
revolvers
which
share
the
relevant
property
are
dangerous
we
see
that
the
argument
fails
me
to
quote
my
sources
because
i
dont
keep
a
ton
of
gun
magazines
andor
why
would

btw
why
the

the

right
on
the

of
chicago
that

so
kratz
was

does
that
mean
that
hes

even
in
the

most
of

are
not

that
only

have

not
so
as
far
as
the

are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing

marksmanship
how
was
it
obvious
were
they
not
trying

hit
the
target
or
does
kratz
confuse
marksmanship
with
trying
to
simulate
a
post
if
so
that
excludes
selfdefense
shooting
but
the
rest
of
us
understand
that
that
exclusion
would
be
an
error
it
excludes
a
lot
of
legit

games
as
well
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their

out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
sounds
like
practical
pistol
or
maybe
ipsc
it
also
sounds
like
how
a
selfdefense

might
well
practice
the
only
things
that

excludes
are

they

the

lets
not

they
try

theyre
wrong
this
comparison
doesnt

it
doesnt

either
for
example
the
goal
is
not
to
kill
the
attacker
whatever
your
relationship
to
him
but
to
stop
him
while
the
number
of
killings
may
be
proportional
to
the

it
isnt
equal
anyone

than
to
kill
an
intruder
this
is
an
oftenquoted
statistic
and
it
is
misleading
for
sev
eral
reasons
outlined
below
the
study
gives
the
impression
that
if
you
own
a
gun
the
likelihood
that
you
will
successfully
use
it
to
defend
yourself
is
less
than
that
of
the

being
turned
against
you
the

however
fails

take
into

cases
where
a
lawabiding
citizen
uses
a

to
thwart
a
crime
without
actually
killing

perpe

actually

dif

statistic
a

it
is
to

better
than
those
who
resist

by
some
other
means
or
who
offer
no
resistance
at
all
statistics
available
from
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
also
show
that
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
by
a
noncriminal
to
defend
against

threat
than
to
be

to
commit
criminal
homicide
times
more
likely
to
be

than
to
accidentally
kill
anybody
and
times
more
likely

to

in

this

than

texas
is
unusual
in
this

it
would
be
nice
to

though
as
texas
doesnt

have
an

i
would

it
is

rate
i
should
not

be

if
you
didnt

at

we
all
agree
on
this
one
but
we
also
live
in

and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
heres
where
we
run
into
a
problem
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
have
government
regulation
on
something
which
is
likely
to
cause
others
harm
what
were
discussing
though
is
the
extreme
regulation
of
a
large
group
in
order
to
target
a
small
group
and
i
dont
think
thats
appropriate
do
you
have
an
insurance
then
youll
have
to
pay
because
of
what
others
do
do
you
buy
anything
you
are
paying
for
those
who
return
goods
steal
or
even
those
who

do
you
live

then
you
cant
do
ererything
youd

does
this
then
justify
anything
at
some
point
you
have
to
draw
a
line
at
least
to
my
way
of
thinking
where
the
government
must
have
something
a
little
more
substantial
than
a
set
of
percentages
with
which
to
punish
an
individual
where
do
you
draw
the
line
or
is
there
one
one
state
dont
remember
which
texas
tried
to
impose
a
rule
that
you
could
only
buy
one
gun
each
month
think
you
all
know
what
happened
virginia
it
passed
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on

people
does
it
it
seems
like
you
all
realize
that
you
have
a
problem
in
america
the
only
problem
is
that
you
wont
take
the
car
away
from
the
drunk
driver
you
hope
to
cure
him
first
cute
analogy
the
us
doesnt
treat
drunk
driving
like
a
serious
crime
however
we
also
dont
confiscate
cars
of
people
who
drink
we
also
dont
confiscate
all
cars
because
some
people
drink
and
drive
its
the
core
of
the
legal
system
that
in
order
to
punish
an
individual
and
id
call
property
confiscation
a
punishment
you
must
have
evidence
against
that
individual
that
is
it
isnt
enough
to
show
that

from

according
to

accounts
by
those
in

the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
this
claim
hasnt
been
retracted
or
contradicted
yet
as
many
earlier
government
claims
have
at
least
one
clip
showed
a
fire
erupting
after
a
tank
busted
in
a
wall
we
have
unsubstantiated
claims
by
the
government
about
the
flirs
spotting
simultaneous
fires
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
thats
easy
six
hours
of
cs
gas
heavy
smoke
from
a
rapidly
spreading
fire
confusion
panic
only
got
out
the
building
was
collapsing
all
around
them
and
finding
the
way
out
was
a
matter
of
luck
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
the
davidians
may
have
committed
suicide
or
some
few
zealots
among
them
might
have
started
the
fires
that
is
possible
but
given
the
governments
earlier
inability
to
tell
a
straight
story
i
find
my
above
scenario
equally
possible
i
wait
for
some
independent
investigation
to
look
into
the
whole
thing
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
government
spokespeople
had
been
consistent
and
forthright
throughout
keeping
the
press
far
away
and
ghettoized
in
pools
was
not
conducive
to
building
up
trust
sealing
the
warrants
was
nonoptimal
as
well
this
operation
was
out
of
control
from
the
gitgo
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
speaking
only
for
myself
i
think
bush
and
reagan
should
have
been
impeached
over
irancontra
in
i
would
probably
have
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
government
no
more
like
i
said
ill
wait
to
see
the
results
of
an
independent
investigation
if
there
is
one
before
i
choose
whom
to
believe
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
you
got
one
anyway
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
i
generally
vote
for
the
lesser
of
two
evils
this
last
time
it
was
the
least
of
three
evils
if
people
will
believe
that
of
any
politican
it
is
little
wonder
they
will
believe
all
of
the
factoids
being
given
out
as

so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided

eighty

are
they

just
plain
evil
or
what
did

points

version
well
the
question
of
why
fire
equipment
took
so
long

has
been
answered
abc
aired
a
report
including
the
tapes
from
monday
the
fbi
called
within
minutes
of
the
fires
breakout
unfortunately
dispatch
of
vehicles
outside
the
waco
city
limits
required
approval
of
a
deputy
chief
who
was
not
available
literally
out
to
lunch
the
operator
desperately
called
around
to
local
community
volunteer
fire
departments
to
get
something
out
there
by
the
time
trucks
arrived
minutes
later
the
whole
complex
was
aflame
and
it
was
clearly
too
little
too
late
there
were
just
two
pumpers
and
no
water
supply
the
fbi
made
another
call
requesting
a
tank
truck
but
the
waco
department
apparently
depended
on
hydrants
and
did
not
have
one
though
clearly
unwilling
to
risk
firemens
lives
in
the
line
of
fire
it
seems
they
might
have
done
so
had
there
been
sufficient
equipment
and
water
to
make
a
difference
they
even
aired
a
tape
of
a
woman
who
called
waco
from
georgia
asking
if
anything
was
being
done
civicminded
but
probably
irresponsible
if
everyone
watching
television
did
that
no
local
calls
could
get
through
abc
also
aired
the
comments
of
an
independent
fire
investigator
who
viewed
tapes
from
more
than
one
side
of
the
compound
not
just
the
standard
pool
shot
and
agreed
that
the
fire
a
must
have
been
started
in
at
least
places
and
b
must
have
had
an
accelerant
to
spread
so
fast
neither
of
these
is
conclusive
proof
that
the

offed
themselves
more

a
thought
personally
if

side
i
wonder
about
the
timing
if

why
wait
through
six
hours
of
wallbashing

teargassing
before
starting
was
there
anything

happened
just
around
that
point

why
wait

it

reasonable
to
believe
the

would
set

early

the
most
plausible
to
me
explaination
is
that
of
an
accidental
starting
of
the
fire
by
the
tanks
among
other
things
i
say
that
because
i
was
listening
to
the
radio
when
the
fire
started
and
the
reporter
watching
from
a
distance
of
course
said
that
it
looked
like
at
least
one
of
the
tanks
had
penetrated
farther
into
the
building
than
previously
specifically
he
said
that
one
tank
apparently
was
halfway
half
of
the

lenght
into
the

where
it
previously
had

the

up

national

watch
well
the

damaged

find

plausible
doesnt

i
dont
find
it
intrinsically
less

than
the

the
batf
is
by
no

devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this

but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
indeed
according
to
the
lawyers
the
davidian
survivors
say
that
lanterns
were
knocked
over
during
the
probing
and
thats
how
the

started

as

imho
up

the

is

we

no

if
this

their

we

not

give

a

if

you

i
was
reading

and
something
just
did
not
make
sence
and
i
was
wondering
if
someone
could
help
me
out
say
usc

as
provided

it

well
i
got
to
looking
in
my
law
dictionary
and
i
found
that
a
person
might
also
be
an
artificial
entity
that
is
created
by
government
and
has
no
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
so
what
i
dont
understand
is
how
a
statute
like
can
be
enforced
on
an
individual
so
someone
tell
me
how
my
government
can
tell
me
what
i
can
or
cannot
possess
just
passing
a
law
does
not
make
it
law
everyone
knows
that
laws
are
constitional
until
it
goes

so
has
it
ever
gone

not
just
your

u
im
not
a
lawyer
but
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
the
congress
has
no
more
rights
than
what
is
enumerated
in
the
constitution
that
is
the
prime
reason
why
the
national
firearms
act
is
based
on
collecting
revenue
since
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
the
nfa
is
a
tax
act
and
the
registration
requirement
within
it
is
to
assist
in
that
tax
collection
usc
in
order
to
be
constitutional
must
have
a
basis
on
a
particular
authority
granted
to
the
congress
by
the
constitution
congress
can
not
arbitrarily
ban
a
substance
or
product
that
is
why
prohibition
came
into
effect
only
by
passing
an
ammendment
what
you
said
about
constitutionality
of
law
needs
to
be
clarified
i
believe
that
an
unconstitutional
law
was
never
constitutional
when
a
law
is
determined
by
the
supreme
court
to
be
unconstitutional
that
law
was
never
really
a
law
the
very
nature
of
the
law
being
unconstitutional
invalidates
the
law
at
its
inception
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
but
when
a
law
is
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
anyone
convicted
of
breaking
that
law
is
absolved
i
dont
believe
usc
has
ever
been
challenged

homemade
guncertainly
not
something
capable
of
sustained
accurate
fire
but
it
would
be
useful
as
a
means
of
getting
a
normal
gun
recall
the
tiny
singleshot
pistols
made
by
the
allies
during
world
war
ii
for
use
by
partisans
they
were
essentially
wellmade
zipguns
incapable
of
effective
fire
beyond
a
few
feet
but
they
were
useful
as
a
means
of
killing
german
soldiers
for
their
guns
also
note
that
the
crowdpleasin
favorite
the

gun
was
specifically
designed
to
require
as
little
machine
work
as
possible

been
made
here
that

make

i
still
think
that
while
the
point
is
good
i
think
theres
a
difference
between
marijuana
and
firearms
in
that
quality
marijuana
can
be
grown
locally
theres
no
need
to
import
the
stuff
if
guns
are
banned
i
think
the
demand
for
real
guns
will
be
sufficient
to
make
smuggling
economically
feasible
thus
rendering
a
ban
moot
in
any
case
the
result
would
be
the
samepeople
who
arent
criminals
wont
have
firearms
and
bad
guys
will
continue
to
have
access
to
them
one
way
or
another
and
i
dont
see
that
as
a
necessary

hi
in
canada
any
gun
that
enters
a
national
park
must
be
sealed
i
think
its
a
small
metal
tag
thats
placed
over
the
trigger
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
from
bears
or
psychos
in
the
national
parks
instead
one
has
to
be
sensitive
to
the
dangers
and
annoyances
of
hiking
in
bear
country
and
take
the
appropriate
precautions
i
think
this
policy
makes
the
users
of
the
national
parks
feel
a
little
closer
to
nature
that
they
are
a
part
of
nature
and
as
such
have
to
deal
with
nature
on
its

said
that

many
of
you

how

burns

of

it
is

that

were

they
would
try

seal
the

to
keep
out
the
tear
gas
when
they
learned
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
escape
they
were
trapped
by
the
flames
in

in

the

is

how

you

cult
leader
david

sprang
into

he
left

began
looking
around

making
sure
women

were
secure
and
checking
that
everyone
had

this

their

gleaned
from

who
spoke
with
six
of
them
who
are
jailed
on
charges
that
include
conspiracy
and
murder
that
day
the
six
said
a

saying
this
was

aw
gee
and
whose
fault
is
that
they
kept
their
word
by
dawn
tanks
were
battering
the
mount
carmel
compound
punching
for
hours
to
creat
holes
for

to
enter
the

meanwhile
proceeded
with

strapped

the

did

others
read

in

the

all

sides
still
it
was
hard
to
ignore
what
was
happening
around

each

a

rammed
the

hundreds

the

than
the

at

one

was
hit
in

dear

the

the

heavy
with
all
that
wind
blowing

scattered
throughout

the

made

the

in

hoped
to

the

diverges
from
the

version
the

says
cult

set
fires
in
three
places
but
each
of
the
six
cult
members
in
separate
discussions
with
lawyers
consistently
gave
versions
at
odds
with
the
fbis
account
they
say
the
tank
flattened
a
barrel
of
propane
spilling
its
contents
and
as
the
tank
thundered
through
the
house
it
tipped
over

koreshs
lawyer
the
tanks
were
not
pumping
cs
gas
but
were
ejecting
exploding
canisters
from
the
tank
booms
that
penetrated
multiple
walls
before
exploding
okay
their
word
against
the
fbis
at
this
point
see
ya
in
court
the
tanks
were
collapsing
interior
walls
and
ceilings
putting
people
at
great
risk
dear
dear
they
could
have
come
out
the
construction
of
the
coupound
used
almost
all
used
materials
that
were
very
dry
and
bails
of
hay
were
stacked
against
the
walls
as
shields
against
the
governments
bullets
okay
they
were
living
in
a
fire
hazard
that
they
built
said
that
previous
to
the
invasion
there
were
no
military
drills
and
that
the
supplies
they
had
on
hand
were
for
survival
no
crime
irrelevant
either
way
their
gas
masks
worked
so
well
that
many
members
were
having
bible
study
and
some
were
sleeping
when
the
fire
was
set
ah
yes
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
do
hold
bible
study
take
a
nap
always
a
wise
course
of
action
when
youre
being
gassed
there
was
no
group
instruction
of
any
kind
from
koresh
or
his
aids
after
the
tank
invasion
referring
to
any
kind
of
suicide
pact
or
counterassault
efforts
i
dont
believe
there
was
a
suicide
pact
i
believe
that
koresh
wanted
a
fiery
conflagration
which
he
may
not
have
told
his
followers
in
fact
this
hypothesis
is
confirmed
by
the
survivors
stories
everyone
had
moved
to
the
center
of
the
compound
in
order
to
escape
the
falling
debris
from
the
tank
invasion
when
the
fire
was
set
yes
thats
right
and
once
the
whole
compound
was
demolished
where
did
they
expect
to
go
women
and
children
who
has
sought
shelter
on
the
second
floor
from
the
tanks
were
trapped
by
doors
jammed
by
the
tanks
ramming
the
building
and
distorting
the
frames
the
building
is
being
rammed
and
they
are
going
upstairs
thats
almost
as
bad
as
running
into
a
fire
hallways
ran
the
length
of
the
buildings
that
acted
as
conduits
for
the
fire
and
trapped
almost
everyone
in
place
his
experts
have
told
him
that
this
horizonal
chimney
effect
is
what
made
the
fire
appear
to
have
started
at
several
places
at
once
hm
an
interesting
notion
well
see
koresh
was
not
seen
the
last
hour
before
the
fire
and
was
assumed
to
be
in
his
floor
room
with
some
of
his
children
more
bible
study
no
doubt
hey
its
a
priority
the
texas
medical
examiner
has
stated
flatly
that
none
of
the
bodies
recovered
so
far
had
bullet
wounds
directly
contradicting
the
fbis
lies
actually
on
friday
he
stated
that
there
was
no
evidence
either
way
and
he
could
not
flatly
contradict
the
federal
agents
claims
well
know
more
later
in
any
event
its
irrelevant
the
survivors
unanimously
stated
that
if
the
victims
could
have
gotten
out
they
would
have
that
they
were
trapped
by
the
tankdestroyed
building
and
the
speed
of
the
fire
for
six
hours
they
were
trapped
the
building
was
not
destroyed
immediately
they
could
have
left
at
any
time
the
underground
bunker
cited
by
the
fbi
as
the
place
koresh
could
have
put
the
children
had
he
not
been
a
cold
blooded
killer
had
been
blocked
by
the
tanks
crashing
down
debris
on
top
of
the
access
door
six
hours
to
move
it
away
or
come
out
dick
said
that
he
had
sat
in
koreshs
bedroom
talking
to
him
and
had
observed
that
his
room
was
furnished
like
all
the
rest
and
without
air
condition
or
other
luxuries
directly
contradicting
the
fbis
claim
that
he
lived
in
splendor
irrelevant
anyway
pr
one
way
or
the
other
but
no
crime
or
innocence
indicated
dick
saw
bullet
holes
in
koreshs
room
made
from
the
outsidein
which
indicates
the
batf
was
indiscriminately
shooting
down
through
the
roof
no
word
on
whether
they
were
being
fired
back
at
which
is
an
operative
question
here
the
fire
was
probably
started
by
the
tanks
knocking
over
coleman
lanterns
that
were
lit
and
sitting
on
a
piano
next
to
the
wall
the
tanks
busted
through
though
none
of
the
survivors
saw
the
fire
start
right
for
six
hours
you
know
that
a
tank
could
come
thru
the
wall
at
any
point
and
you
leave
a
coleman
lantern
burning
near
bales
of
hay
every
one
of
the
survivors
strongly
denies
ever
saying
anything
to
the
fbi
about
starting
the
fire
hearing
someone
say
the
fire
was
lit
or
any
of
the
other
stuff
attributed
to
them
by
the
fbi
its
ultimately
irrelevant
who
lit
the
fire
they
had
ample
opportunity
to
leave
he
said
when
he
first
met
koresh
in
the
compound
he
expected
to
find
a
raving
lunatic
but
instead
found
a
rational
charming
and
intelligent
young
man
and
was
very
surprised
by
that
fact
most
charismatic
leaders
are
extremely
intelligent
actually
they
tend
to
be
excellent
actors
and
skilled
manipulators
ex
ted
bundy
koresh
had
no
drugs
stronger
than
aspirin
to
use
against
pain
medical
assistance
was
jsut
a
phone
call
away
gee
all
he
had
to
do
was
come
out
women
with
children
had
their
own
bedrooms
for
them
and
their
kids
that
were
appointed
as
nicely
as
koreshs
not
relevant
to
any
crimes
dick
said
he
saw
signs
of
home
schooling
for
the
kids
and
at
no
time
did
he
ever
see
any
signs
of
abuse
while
he
was
there
anyway
outsiders
rarely
see
abuse
its
a
secretive
thing
all
we
have
to
go
on
are
the
court
documents
in
the
jewell
case
and
the
mistrial
in
california
no
one
was
ever
held
against
their
wills
and
could
have
left
at
any
time
the
people
who
were
murdered
in
the
fire
were
there
by
their
own
choices
exactly
by
their
own
choice
he
called
for
an
independent
prosecutor
if
ever
there
were
a
need
for
one
this
is
it
looks
like
there
will
be
several
investigations
starting
with
congressional
committee
hearings
next
week
his
closing
comments
were
they
dont
look
upon
themselves
as
a
cult
they
view
themselves
as
highly
religious
people
they
sincerely
believe
what
they
believe
and
who
am
you
or
i
to
judge
that
as
wrong
his
last
sentence
says
it
all
who
the
hell
are
we
or
the
government
to
judge
their
religion
as
wrong
this
event
i
hope
will
be
recorded
in
history
as
the
american
holocaust
these
people
were
murdered
by
the
us
government
just
as
surely
as
the
jews
were
by
the
nazis
i
hang
my
head
in
shame
for
what
ive
allowed
my
government
to
become
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
just
as
we
dont

who
shoots
a
kid
who
had

so
i
better
surrender
or
c
roll
over
and
let
whoever
is
attacking
your

do
what
they
would
like
you
have
chosen

and
discover
that
the
people
you
defended
yourself
against
are
federal

who
now
are
camped

door
waiting
for

to

you
have
learned

charge
you
with
murder
and
are
further
defaming
your

while
claiming
that
you
can

surrender

they
start
using
psychological

techniques
against
you
while
still
claiming

you
can
safely
give
up
and
will
receive
a
fair
trial
some
weeks
into

standoff
you
are
still
holding
out
when
they
begin
a

induce
your
surrender

using

spot
of
tea
with
them
you
probably
gave
up
on
arguing
the
case
for
arms
control
directly
long
ago
because
posters
who
know
what
they
are
talking
about
eg
frank
crary
disproved
all
your
arguments
for
why
more
gun
control
is
needed
so
you
gave
up
because
you
know
they
are
right
and
you
couldnt
refute
their
answers
no
frank
crarys
arguments
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
most
people
are
sane
normal
people
tpg
disproves
this
of
gun
owners
what
an
amazing
thing
i
didnt
realize
that
over
a
hundred
million
gun
owners
all
posted
to
tpg
even
if
all
the
posts
in
talkpoliticsguns
illustrated
what
you
say
they
illustrate
it
would
still
only
reflect
the
written
personas
which
is
often
different
from
facetoface
of
a
very
very
small
and
select
group
anybody
who
seriously
generalizes
any
attitudes
or
positions
on
usenet
to
the
general
population
of
any
country
either
doesnt
care
about
accuracy
or
needs
to
have
a
few
realities
explained
to
them
usenet
as
a
whole
disproves
it
of
humanity
as
a
whole
speaking
of
which
most
of
the
readership
posts
ive
seen
put
the
most
read
newsgroups
at
about
readers
a
number
i
have
a
feeling
is
fairly
inflated
the
posters
rare
and
regular
are
themseleves
a
very
tiny
minority
of
that
group
and
the
whole
of
usenet
readers
are
themselves
a
very
distorted
sample
of
humanity
if
anything
the
only
real
thing
you
can
get
out
of
the
relative
sample
of
usenet
readers
is
that
weve
got
too
much
equipment
and
too
much
time
available
to
us
we
now
have
proof
positive
that
guns
dont
make
you
safer
buy
a
lot
of
guns
and
you
either
get
shot
in
the
no
knock
raid
or
get
the
fbi
to
burn
down
your
house
proof
that
guns
dont
make
you
safer
is
that
if
you
buy
one
the
government
will
show
up
and
kill
you
tell
me
if
the
government
took
away
the
voting
rights
of
everybody
who
exercised
their
free
speech
would
that
then
be
proof
that
free
speech
squelches
political
activity
you
are
equating
two
things
with
each
other
that
dont
see
even
in
the
paranoid
mindset
of
tpg
there
are
good
reasons
to
support
gun
control
phill
if
you
really
believe
that
the
various
posts
on
computer
nets
represents
either
most
of
the
posters
in
person
personalities
or
the
general
publics
general
opinions
then
i
have
some
serious
reservations
about
your
grasp
on
reality
but
dont
expect
you
really
do
believe
that
its
simply
a
convenient
way
to
make
your
point

hopefully
make

over

yesterday
morning
that
arlan
specter
senator

has
already
called
for

the
problem
is
that
specter
was
one
of
the
key
government
attorneys
several
years

who
did
what
he
could
to
coverup
facts

before
all
the

are

as
well
as
to
manipulate
what
we
see
and
thus
what
we
believe
any
ways
one
of
koreshs
devoted
followers
that
did
i
repeat
did
survive
this
genocidal
massslaughter
of
innocent
people
besides
there
are
nine
survivors
in
the
burnunit
of
the
local
hospital
and
was
reported
that
david
was
in
one
of
the
towers
when
the
shit
hit
the
fan
besides
a
majority
of
these
children
were
children
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
father
of
this
then
makes
them
bastard
children
to
a
sacraligious
zeloit
sp
also
someone
should
have
told
david
and
his
followers
that
if
they
cant
the
heat
then
they
should
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
pun
intended
so
if
you
werent
saying
that
the
deaths
of
bastard
children
of
a
sacreligious
zealot
was
no
big
thing
and
i
know
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
read
it
that
way
just
what
the
hell
were
you
saying
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
so
who
brainwashed
you
into
believing
that
whatever
the
government
says
it
the
truth
or
that
koresh
was
any
actual
threat
to
you
and
the
rest
of
the
us
havent
you
ever
stopped
to
wonder
why
the
government
raided
this
farm
this
raid
was
not
about
religion
sex
or
child
abuse
to
the
best
available
evidence
at
the
moment
this
raid
psychological
torture
and
group
death
was
about
koreshs
failure
to
pay
a
tax
on
one
grenade
launcher
that
he
may
or
may
not
even
have
had
thats
why
it
was
the
batf
doing
the
raiding
in
the
first
place
do
you
think
a
tax
evasion
justifies
an
armed
assault
by
the

with
armed
men
in
trailers
orchestrated
character
assassination
noise
torture

i

both
with

what

phrase
in
the
associated
federalist
papers
my
webster
and
my
reading
of
the
language
convinces
me
that
the
word
meant
both
under
control
and
disciplined
and
not
of
good
marksmanship
i
think
the
latter
a
special
interest
pleading
no
one

well

unambiguously

not

i

militia
clause

not

look
i
dont

to
bore
everybody
here
with
the
physics
of
woodstoves
but
theyre
not
anything
like
your

it
takes
about
three
hours
for
a
woodstove
to
get
hot
enough
to
cook
on
and
afterwards
you
cant
just
shut
it
off
it
will
contain
hot
embers
for

a

argued

the

is
further
restrict

karen
mcnutt
a
local
attorney
states
that
there
are
about
two
million
licensed
gun
owners
in
massachusetts
in
the
past
year
the
number
of
licensed
gun
owners
involved
in
gun
crimes
was
something
like
six
yet
there
were
a
large
number
of
gun
crimes
in
the
state
last
year
does
passing
laws
that
will
further
restricting
only
those
people
already
obeying
laws
pay
any
dividents
all
im
saing
is
that
guns
should
be
treated
with
respect
from
owners
sellers
and
legislators
so
far
ive
seen
them
treated
with
the
least
respect
by
legislators
i
believe
guns
are
a
problem
in
many
countries
and
that
crime
rates
would
fell
if
they
were
more
restricted
see
this
is
what
i
call
the
argument
from
religion
i
believe
dont
believe
its
not
necessary
to
take
this
on
faith
go
look
at
the
history
of
countries
that
passed
gun
restrictions
pay
particular
attention
to
whether
or
not
violent
crime
was
higher
before
the
restrictions
and
lower
after
dont
look
at
violent
gun
crimes
thats
begging
the
question
you
may
be
very
surprised
if
all
crimes
done
with
guns
stopped
and
all
accidents
also
stopped
or
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
then
i
would
consider
lifting
all
gun
control
you
have
this
absolutely
backwards
if
crime
stopped
in
the
presence
of
strict
gun
control
there
is
no
way
i
would
consider
lifting
any
of
it
however
if
gun
control
made
absolutely
no
improvement
in
the
violent
crime
rate
thats
when
i
would
have
it
lifted
think
about
it
so
far
none
of
the
stats
show
any
improvement
likevise
if
caraccidents
fell
to
a
minimum
in
europe
i
and
probably
most
people
i
know
would
demand
easier
driverstests
ca
hours
and
more
than
today
do
you
really
think
drivers
tests
are
any
indication
of
your
propensity
for
having
accidents
ive
never
known
anybody
stupid
enough

take

just
saw
a
new
commercial
by
the
nra
it
starts
out
with
a
bunch
of
politicians
talking
about
how
to
get
rid
of
crime
they
finally
realize
that
they
need
to
put
criminals
away
longer
but
there
isnt
enough
jail
space
so
they
decide
on
another
gun
law
during
this
whole
seen
there
quoteing
various
statistics
on
how
easy
criminals
get
off
in
the
next
seen
the
politician
is
announceing
on
tv
how
this
gun
law
will
get
rid
of
crime
and
there
is
this
grungy
looking

criminal
watching

i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed
and
waited
and
it
was
a
first
offense
what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
anyone
jason
if
in
said
situation
i
would
reviewing
other
cases
ive
seen
reported
on
in
the
articles
ive
read
etc
suggest
the
safest
legal
course
of
action
is
as
follows
warn
your
assailant
loudly
and
in
clear
tones
that
you
have
a
weaponyeseven
though
its
blatantly
obvious
now
that
you
have
it
out
and
that
you
will
shoot
him
if
he
advancesdoes
not
cease
whatever
hostile
action
he
is
currently
involved
in
ie
drop
the
knife
or
ill
shoot
repeat
this
process
three
timesif
you
cannot
if
hes
pointing
a
freaking
gun
at
you
himselfthats
kinda
impractical
there
are
variables
here
and
i
will
try
to
address
them
in
turn
after
said
warning
considering
its
ignored
aim
center
mass
and
fire
until
he
drops
this
is
not
sadism
its
practicalityif
he
hasnt
gone
down
hes
still
a
threatwhy
i
support
if
he
turns
and
runs
do
not
pursue
or
fire
at
his
back
shots
fired
in
anger
will
burn
you
later
though
in
some
cases
the
i
can
see
where
that
might
not
bother
me
all
that
much
if
you
do
drop
him
remain

you
are

at

come
on
a
gun
kills
people
rather
people
kill
people
with
guns
the
sad
truth
is
sometimes
that
is
good
or
at
least
better
than
the
alternative
but
lets
ignore
guns
for
defence
andor
crime
and
look
at
gun
accidents
ok
there
are
about
fatal
firearm
accidents
per
year
and
the
number
has
been
in
decline
since
early
this
century
most
of
these
accidents
involve
rifles
or
shot
guns
not
handguns
but
seriously
a
gun
is
designed
to
fire
a
bullet
this
is
not
so
you
can
shoot
cardboard
cut
outs
down
at
the
range
in
fact
there
are
both
guns
and
bullets
designed
specifically
for
that
the
idea
that
my
ruger
mark
ii
bull
barrel
a
semiauto
caliber
handgun
was
designed
to
kill
or
hurt
people
even
for
self
defense
would
im
sure
come
as
a
surprise
to
its
designer
it
certainly
isnt
why
i
have
it
it
certainly
would
hurt
someone
if
you
shot
them
with
it
and
might
even
kill
them
but
it
is
simply
wrong
to
say
it
was
designed
to
kill
people
this
is
not
designed
to
act
as
a
tool
for
home
defence
where
you
show
someone
that
you
have
a
gun
and
they
go
gee
perhaps
i
should
leave
in
fact
that
is
what
happens
most
of
the
time
most
self
defensive
uses
of
firearms
dont
involve
firing
any
shots
most
criminals
would
prefer
not
to
be
shot
and
will
go
to
some
effort
not
to
be
including
doing
what
you
say
when
you
point
a
gun
at
them
if
you
were
called
on
to
design
a
tool
that
could
be
easily
carried
to
immediately
stop
someone
attacking
you
what
would
it
be
a
handgun
is
about
the
best
anyone
has
come
up
with
and
experience
shows
it
does
work
the
no
you
see
the
gun
was
designed
to
fire
that
little
bullet
into
a
human
body
and
hurt
them
not
a
tough
concept
to
swallow
for
most
certainly
no
one
argues
that
handguns
of
the
type
we
are
discussing
arent
deadly
weapons
however
it
simply
isnt
true
to
say
that
all
of
them
were
designed
to
kill
people
moreover
what
exactly
is
wrong
with
having
deadly
weapons
there
are
times
when
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
use
deadly
force
eg
in
self
defense
i
consider
it
not
just
my
right
but
my
duty
to
defend
myself
and
my
family
and
that
includes
having
and
knowing
how
to
use
the
tools
to
do
that
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a
last
resort
to
protect
themselves
against
tyranny
in
government
t
jefferson
i
think
what
jefferson
said
is
still
true
and
the
trouble
with
having
such
an
item
is
often
the
little
bullet
goes
off
into
the
wrong
fleshy
target
not
very
often
compared
to
other
or
else
uncle
frank
gets
pissed
and
blows
away
his
wife
this
isnt
that
common
either
at
least
when
compared
to
other
uses
it
is
very
rare
that
a
nonviolent
person
will
suddenly
getpissed
and
kill
someone
gun
or
not
in
most
cases
the
people
who
murder
have
long
histories
of
violence
if
you
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
these
people
wouldnt
kill
if
they
didnt
have
a
gun
feel
free
to
present
it
having
a
thing
specificly
designed
to
kill
means
it
is
much
easier
to
kill
things
right
right
but
there
are
times
when
killing
things
is
called
for
i
hope
i
never
have
to
shoot
a
person
but
ive
had
to
kill
a
number
of
animals
from
rodents
to
cows
and
when
i
do
i
dont
want
them
to
suffer
any
more
than
is
necessary
i
prefer
they
die
instantly
but
failing
that
i
want
them
to
drop
so
i
can
quickly
finish
them
with
the
next
shot
and
failing
that
i
dont
want
them
to
go
fast
or
far
i
try
to
choose
the
best
weapon
and
ammunition
i
have
to
try
to
achieve
that
goal
for
the
size
of
animal
im
after
but
it
doesnt
always
work
as
i
plan
without
belaboring
the
point
people
who
are

folks
i
realize
i
have
stuck
my
foot
in
my
mouth
quite
a
few
times
already
so
please
let
me
make
some
clarifications
my
inaccurate
information
in
my
posts
was
due
to
lack
of
knowledge
thanks
to
you
kind
and
some
not
so
kind
people
i
am
learning
some
people
have
given
me
several
good
points
to
ponder
and
i
see
how
i
was
wrong
in
no
way
was
this
inaccurate
information
supposed
to
be
trying
to
further
the
antigun
cause
i
have
said
several
times
before
but
nobody
seemed
to
be
listening
that
i
am
progun
and
antiguncontrol
as
far
as
the
race
can
of
worms
that
i
have
opened
up
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
i
am
in
no
way
prejudiced
some
of
the
things
i
have
stated
were
said
to
demonstrate
that
i
am
not
prejudiced
andor
a
racist
but
i
have
been
accused
of
being
too
aware
of
race
and
prejudiced
i
will
not
say
anymore
about
that
subject
because
no
matter
what
i
say
it
will
be
the
wrong
thing
boy
what
a
start
to
being
on
a
new
group
oh
well
things
have
been
worse
in
my
life
i
hope
this
clears
things
up
but
i
guess
that
will
remain
to
be
seen
by
for
now

that
suggests

may

attempting

during

there
is
a
possibility
that
these
are
the
bodies
of
people
killed
during
the
initial
shootout
phill
hallambaker
can
you
imagine
what
happens
when
a
magazine
explodes
bullets
go
flying
every
where
imho
these
gunshot
wounds
were
actually
caused
when
the
magazines
went
up
a
texas
ranger
does
not
a
pathologist
make
so
ill
wait
for
an
autopsy
to
determine
if
they
were
shot
first
i
would
doubt
bullets
would
go
flying
there
is
no
particular
force
to
make
the
bullet
leave
the
scene
of
a
cartridge
going
off
outside
of
a
barrel
the
brass
shell
would
burst
too
soon
to
give
the
bullet
any
real
velocity
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
near
it
but
i
do
not
think
bullet
wounds
would
result
shrapnel
wounds
would
be
more
likely
at
least
this
is
my
understanding
not
necessarily
if
the
body
had
been
denatured
cooked
or
dehydrated
due
to
the
heat
a
projectile
needs
only
a
minimal
kinetic
force
to
penetrate
in
fire
aftermaths
bodies
tend
to
fall
apart
or
loose
large
chunks
of
meat
with
little
effort
medical
examiners
tend
not
to
like
cleaning
up
such
scenes
as
such
if
the
body
had
been
suitably
cooked
a
bullet
comming
from
a
magazine
explosion
would
more
than
likely
have
enough
force
to
enter
and
thus
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
bullet
entered
at
the
time
of
death
or
much
later
unless
you
were
trained
to
look
for
the
evidence
texas
rangers
are
not
pathologists
either

theyre
all

okay
what
have
we
learned
for
reasons
still
being
kept
secret
a
federal
agency
already
known
well
enough
to
be
examined
and
rebuked
by
several
legislative
committees
over
the
years
for
a
longstanding
violent
disregard
of
the
law
invades
the
home
of
a
man
whose
religious
beliefs
and
personal
habits
they
abominate
violating
his
rights
under
the
first
second
fourth
fifth
ninth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
the
man
and
his
followers
fight
back
killing
four
of
the
outlaw
agencys
minions
wounding
many
more
and
suffering
their
own
losses
in
the
process
the
agency
responds
by
cutting
off
his
electricity
water
and
especially
his
contact
with
the
outside
world
they
are
then
free
to
say
anything
at
all
about
him
in
pronouncements
that
contradict
one
another
daily
as
the
agency
finds
itself
locked
in
a
bitter
power
struggle
with
another
outfit
eager
to
gain
credit
for
straightening
out
the
mess
and
more
importantly
to
script
his
side
of
the
subsequent
negotiations
any
way
they
please
the
impasse
lasts
almost
two
months
ironically
at
the
same
time
four
la
cops
are
being
given
a
second
trial
for
brutalizing
a
single
individual
sparking
one
of
the
ugliest
riots
in
history
armored
vehicles
surround
the
house
already
ringed
with
snipers
using
scoped
highpowered
rifles
loudspeakers
playing
obnoxious
records
at
the
highest
possible
volume
and
searchlights
deprive
those
in
the
house
of
sleep
in
the
aftermath
nobody
in
authority
will
mention
the
effect
this
technique
originated
by
north
korean
communists
as
a
battle
tactic
may
have
had
on
their
judgment
finally
another
irony
on
the
anniversary
of
the
rising
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
some
of
the
armor
punches
holes
in
the
house
and
gas
of
some
kind
is
injected
the
house
bursts
into
flame
and
is
reduced
to
ashes
in
less
than
an
hour
at
least
lives
including
those
of
more
than
a
dozen
children
are
snuffed
out
spokesmen
for
the
outlaw
agencies
the
attorney
general
and
the
president
all
hold
press
conferences
to
articulate
a
common
theme
blame
the
victim
he
had
illegal
weapons
as
soon
as
they
can
be
prepared
in
a
secret
government
workshop
and
planted
among
the
cinders
being
examined
by
the
agency
that
created
them
he
was
abusing
children
the
tapes
will
be
stored
with
the
data
on
the
jfk
assassination
he
set
the
fire
our
snipers
saw
him
doing
it

at
in
ad
he
shot
his
followers
who
tried
to
escape
or
was
that
jim
jones
best
of
all
hes
dead
he
cant
say
a
damn
thing
to
embarrass
us
any
more
than
when
his
contact
with
the
world
was
severed
at
the
start
of
the
whole
travesty
a
leading
national
paper
claims
of
the
american
people
believe
that
a
man
who
resisted
a
savage
attack
on
his
home
is
somehow
responsible
for
everything
that
resulted
but
when
did
you
ever
know
of
americans
to
agree
on
anything
doesnt
this
sound
more
like
the
outcome
of
a
soviet
election
than
an
opinion
poll
very
well
what
can
we
infer
from
the
above
for
starters
never
forget
that
although
democratic
careers
are
on
the
line
and
rightfully
so
over
this
fiasco
by
the
outlaw
agencys
admission
it
was
planned
and
rehearsed
by
a
republican
administration
which
may
explain
why
paul
harvey
who
evidently
used
up
all
his
courage
and
integrity
changing
his
mind
at
about
the
same
time
i
did
about
the
war
in
viet
nam
has
been
acting
as
little
more
than
a
mouthpiece
for
a
state
that
has
no
regard
for
the
bill
of
rights
more
importantly
when
rush
limbaugh
whos
been
a
quivering
tower
of
jello
during
the
whole
thing
takes
essentially
the
same
stance
as
bill
clinton
its
time
for
fundamental
changes
if
not
in
the
system
then
at
least
within
yourself
on
march
back
at
the
beginning
mary
gingell
national
chair
of
the
libertarian
party
issued
a
press
release
condemning
the
outlaw
agency
and
calling
for
its
abolition
in
fact
the
lp
has
promised
in
its
platform
since
for
at
least
years
to
abolish
both
agencies
involved
in
waco
im
proud
to
say
i
was
there
and
helped
to
write
that
plank
true
the
lp
is
tiny
and
insignificant
although
less
so
than
in
ask
the
democrats
in
georgia
if
you
doubt
it
but
alone
in
a
howling
wilderness
of
fascists
scrambling
now
to
cover
their
behinds
with
phony
polls
and
big
lies
the
lp
is
right
about
what
happened
in
waco
and
if
their
advice
had
been
followed
in
waco
never
would
have
happened
think
about
it
and
think
about
the
fact
that
if
youve
had
enough
of
political
parties
more
interested
in
collecting
and
holding
power
at
whatever
cost
to
the
bill
of
rights
let
alone
human
life
than
in
defending
and
expanding
individual
liberty
maybe
the
change
its
time
for
within
yourself
is
to
make
the
lp
less
tiny
and
insignificant
by
a
single
voice
and
a
single
vote
think
about
it

subject
no

no
surrender
delivered
by
lenda
jackson
at
the
rkba
rally
in
denver
april
it
is
a
fact
of
modern
life
that
urban
residents
particularly
women
feel
threatened
a
certain
number
of
them
actually
are
threatened
there
are
immediate
threats
the
things
that
women
will
tell
you
theyre
afraid
of
the
noise
downstairs
at
night
the
lonely
walk
to
the
car
the
stranger
at
the
door
the
abusive
husband
finally
kicked
out
of
the
house
as
he
threatens
to
hurt
her
and
their
children
the
burglar
the
muggerthe
rapist
and
what
are
we
told
is
the
solution
move
get
a
dog
keep
the
door
locked
call
the
police
as
a
nexttolast
resort
learn
martial
arts
and
always
theres
the
implied
question
whats
a
pretty
little
thing
like
you
doing
without
a
husband
around
to
protect
you
but
what
if
you
dont
like
dogs
like
living
alone
dont
have
years
to
devote
learning
judo
what
if
after
examining
the
facts
a
woman
learns
that
rape
victims
using
armed
resistance
were
less
likely
to
have
the
rape
completed
and
were
less
likely
to
be
than
those
using
any
other
form
of
resistance
also
true
for
what
if
to
our
horror
and
despair
we
find
that
citizens
cannot
depend
on
the
police
for
effective
protection
they
usually
respond
after
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
truth
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
police
are
not
responsible
for
protecting
any
individual
only
the
whole
community
as
a
society
are
we
going
to
ask
women
once
again
to
sacrifice
themselves
are
we
going
to
continue
to
deny
women
the
ability
to
help
themselves
heres
a
thought
neil
smith
in
his
book
the
probability
broach
says
no
pound
thug
can
threaten
the
well
being
or
dignity
of
a
pound
woman
who
has
two
pounds
of
iron
to
even
things
out
but
if
a
woman
decides
to
protect
herself
with
the
easiest
most
efficient
means
possible
people
especially
other
women
are
horrified
eughh
how
could
you
id
be
terrified
they
ask
how
could
you
hurt
someone
theyll
repeat
the
lie
itll
just
get
taken
away
from
you
in
truth
of
defensive
gun
uses
result
in
the
offender
taking
the
gun
away
from
the
well
despite
the
lies
and
the
social
pressure
some
of
us
have
already
made
that
hard
choice
weve
decided
that
we
are
not
going
to
be
victimized
by
the
muggers
burglars
or
rapists
were
buying
more
guns
than
every
before
were
learning
how
to
use
them
and
teaching
others
women
and
men
how
to
use
them
most
importantly
we
are
preparing
ourselves
mentally
to
use
our
firearms
for
our
own
defense
were
taking
our
own
security
literally
into
our
own
hands
were
going
to
stop
begging
and
pleading
and
marching
and
what
we
intend
is
to
really
take
back
the
night
but
theres
another
threat
more
insatiable
than
any
mugger
more
secretive
than
any
burglar
more
souldestroying
than
any
rapist
that
menace
is
government
and
it
threatens
us
all
we
know
that
governments
throughout
time
have
suppressed
rights
and
oppressed
people
its
the
way
they
survive
in
our
names
and
with
our
money
it
interferes
with
innocent
people
both
at
home
and
abroad
it
lies
to
us
cheats
us
steals
from
us
and
threatens
us
with
violence
no
one
knows
exactly
what
itll
do
next
what
freedom
we
will
lose
because
some
government
goon
decides
its
for
your
own
safety
or
we
know
best
any
person
who
acted
like
government
does
would
be
psychoanalyzed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
locked
up
as
a
habitual
offender
but
this
monster
called
government
persists
and
grows
and
we
who
should
be
its
masters
have
become
its
unwilling
slaves
do
you
doubt
me
then
why
did
you
file
your
income
tax
like
any
reasonable
person
i
believe
that
being
afraid
of
something
that
can
hurt
you
is
smart
and
that
paranoia
isnt
crazy
if
someones
really
after
you
and
make
no
mistake
theyre
after
you
and
theyre
after
me
their

are

reynolds
groff
metzenbahm
moynihan
and

if
were
lucky
theyll
settle
for
our
assault
rifles
our
shotguns
our
handguns
and
our
ammunition
as
citizens
we
have
only
two
choices
they
are
the
same
two
choices
given
to
women
to
surrender
or
to
fight
surrender
leads
to
the
gulag
to
the
genocide
of
pol
pot
to
the
disappearances
to

i
do
not
intend
to
surrender
a
battle
can
be
philosophical
or
political
in
the
main
the
people
keep
the
government
honest
by
threatening
to
vote
it
out
of
office
but
if
they
have
to
they
will
keep
in
mind
the
words
of
thomas
jefferson
the
tree
of
liberty
must
be
well
watered
with
the
blood
of
patriots
as
a
patriot
i
will
point
out
the
error
in
the
governments
ways
i
will
do
my
best
to
vote
the
villains
out
of
office
i
will
protest
and
write
and
speak
and
teach
our
children
justice
honor
and
truth
and
always
remember
that
rebellion
can
lead
to

and
saratogaor
it
can
lead
to

when

comes

people
are
getting
killed
by
gang
violence
every
day
every
single
day
i
hear
about
more
people
getting
killed
by
gang
violence
and
see
some
of
the
weapons
that
are
being
confiscated
is
kratz
claiming
that
he
can
reliably
visually
distinguish
an
from
an
that
he
can
see
the
difference
between
a
semiauto
and
a
fullauto
uzi
that
he
can
see
the
difference
between
the
various
versions
some
fullauto
some
semiauto
only
of
the
well
let
me
see
uzi
no
no
maybe
i
remember
there
being
a
selector
swtich
on
the
if
i
remember
correctly
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
position
or
an
on
position
because
the
gun
is
semiautomatic
wouldnt
the
have
a
position
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
maybe
round
bursts
if
this
is
correct
wouldnt
it
be
easy
to
distinguish
each
gun
by
this
alone
of
course
if
the
were
modified
to
fullauto
fire
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
that
easy
but
im
talking
about
distinguishing
between
an
unmodified
and
how
about
the
other
guns
do
they
also
have
selector
switch
to
switch
between
semiauto
and
fullyauto
fire
if
so
id
love
to
hear
the
details
if
only
because
theyll
demonstrate
that
kratz
is
blowing
smoke
considering
that
one
can
design
a
gun
so
that
it
looks
just
like
another
gun
yet
have
very
different
properties
and
that
thats
quite
common
most
kids
in
my
neighborhood
were
quite
young
when
they
figured
out
that
my
parents
car
wasnt
much
like
richard
pettys
even
though
it
looked
just
like
it
except
for
the
paint
job
things
must
have
been
different
with
kratz
actually
it
was
pretty
hard
for
the
kids
in
my
neighborhood
to
figure
that
out
as
richard
petty
lived
in
my
neighborhood
and
left
his
stock
car
in
the
driveway
sure
its
on
tv
but
why
does
that
make
a
difference
no
it
doesnt
but
thats
irrelevant
if
visual
inspection
of
the
outside
worked
tv
would
be
acceptable
but
since
it
doesnt
the
fact
that
its
just
as
good
as
seeing
in
person
doesnt
mean
much
well
what
about
what
i
said
above
if
that
is
correct
i
guess
tv
would
be
acceptable
if
you
had
a
good
enough
picture
and
a
picture
of
the
lower
receiver
of

jonestown

some

william
adorno
edited
a
series
of
books
on
the
psychology
of
evil
mass
movements
starting
with
the
authoritarian
personality
university
of
chicago
press
an
attempt
to
figure
out
what
would
motivate
people
to
support
fascism
or
be
the
bad
guys
in
wwii
and
by
extension
in
other
wars
in
racial
lynchings
i
dont
think
the
books
are
perfect
and
the
study
of
psychopathology
has
advanced
but
you
can
elicit
koresh
types
from
even
the
first
volume
so
i
think
theyre
onto
something
how
cult
psychology
works
im
an
amateur
hope
im
not
hopelessly
naive
so
long
as
koresh
could
own
his
people
he
made
sure
they
didnt
believe
there
was
any
life
out
there
for
them
away
from
him
otherwise
hed
koresh
be
nothing
during
the
siege
exdavidians
recounted
how
he
convinced
the
people
in
the
compound
they
survived
only
through
his
intercession
with
god
to
spare
their
worthless
souls
absolutely
classic
brainwashing
technique
as
long
as
they
believed
him
theyd
ignore
batffbichild
protective
services
or
even
the
red
cross
asking
them
to
come
out
after
all
if
they
ever
left
him
god
would
catapult
them
straight
to
hell
and
the
combined
forces
of
the
us
gummint
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
doubtful
couldnt
save
them
for
a
second
if
i
believed
it
id
stay
and
die
too
like
the
folks
in
jonestown
for
a
prosaic
analogy
replace
a
cult
leader
with
an
estranged
wife
or
husband
and
notice
how
many
folks
show
up
kill
the
ex
and
then
themselves
thats
the
consequence
of
shattered
cultism
it
really
does
happen
all
the
time
by
the
way
the
treasured
ideal
in
such
cases
without
which
life
is
meaningless
is
the
relationship
no
matter
how
abusive
rather
than
the
individuals
partner
why
no
news
dont
the
feds
owe
the
world
an
explanation
i
agree
that
official
explanations
are
in
order
i
can
also
see
good
reasons
for
news
blackouts
the
only
fact
available
is
that
had
the
fbi
not
acted
yesterday
those
people
would
be
alive
today
that
no
matter
what
those
people
would
have
died
because
koresh
made
sure
they
believed
they
had
no
lives
outside
his
influence
hence
it
would
make
little
difference
when
or
how
the
fbi
acted
he
held
them
hostage
as
his
trump
against
going
to
jail
but
nothing
would
really
stop
him
from
offing
them
even
if
the
fbi
went
away
look
at
history
rep
leo
ryan
and
some
staffers
visited
jonestown
at
the
request
of
constituents
who
had
relatives
there
once
jonestown
was
discovered
and
even
though
they
killed
ryan
and
his
entourage
they
all
killed
themselves
because
jim
jones
knew
hed
be
busted
internal
arguments
asking
to
spare
the
children
brought
up
by
some
of
the
women
in
the
cult
were
shouted
down
there
are
tapes
the
logic
of
saying
that
no
matter
how
bad
the
gummint
is
it
wouldnt
kill
the
kids
was
shouted
down
as
blasphemy
and
the
people
who
brought
it
up
were
threatened
with
ostracism
by
people
who
by
their
own
avowal
would
be
dead
within
the
hour
i
suspect
its
the
same
with
the
branch
davidians
theres
a
book
on
jonestown
by
james
reston
jr
titled
our
father
who
art
in
hell
i
dont
know
whether
its
good
never
read
it
the
only
way
to
prevent
such
a
problem
would
be
never
to
investigate
reports
of
child
abuse
or
sexual
mistreatment
or
organizations
buying
fullauto
conversion
kits
or
shipping
hand
grenades
via
ups
on
the
off
chance
of
stumbling
across
cults
that
would
kill
themselves
so
the
only
way
the
batffbi
could
save
those
people
and
future
cults
is
by
ignoring
such
signs
i
suppose
theres
another
way
outsmarting
koresh
and
tricking
him
into
letting
them
go
or
somehow
influencing
his
people
to
abandon
him
while
he
owns
most
of
their
means
of
communication
with
the
world
a
mighty
tough
row
to
hoe
i
suspect
the
fbi
tried
to
do
that
with
blackouts
noise
and
other
sensory
insults
however
maybe
theyre
not
very
sophisticated
or
maybe
the
job
is
impossible
its
certainly
possible
the
guy
running
the
show
was
a
jerk
why
the
fbi
might
want
to
blackout
during
and
coverup
after
if
they
were
doing
a
poor
job
of
weaning
the
bds
from
koresh
theyd
want
to
keep
it
quiet
so
they
wouldnt
be
embarrassed
if
they
were
trying
to
wean
the
bds
from
koresh
theyd
want
to
keep
it
quiet
so
he
couldnt
outflank
them
or
wellmeaning
boneheads
from
any
point
of
view
wouldnt
screw
it
up
i
hate
playing
chess
when
the
world
screams
in
my
face
especially
if
at
checkmate
time
people
really
die
and
i
could
be
blamed
i
dont
think
ignoring
such
incidents
is
a
workable
policy
unless
you
deny
the
fbi
batf
child
protective
services
of
whatever
stripe
and
the
rest
of

exist

what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
my
god
a
sane
person
somebody
asking
intelligent
questions
rather
than
spouting
of
unsubstantiated
drivel
and
making
comparisons
to
nazi
germany
i
question
along
with
others
the
initial
raid
by
the
atf
there
are
some
definite
questions
needing
answers
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
probably
which
is
why
there
are
so
many
people
angry
at
the
initial
confrontation
why
attack
a
compound
with
as
many
people
in
that
compound
who
are
willing
to
die
for
their
leader
further
they
attacked
in
the
daylight
hours
without
proper
backup
medical
support
etc
that
was
rather
stupid
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
this
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atfs
initial
raid
i
believe
that
the
remainder
of
the
standoff
was
handled
fairly
well
with
the
single
exception
of
the
psychological
warfare
by
blaring
music
etc
i
think
that
was
uncalled
for
and
probably
hindered
the
outcome
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
see
above
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
agreed
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
which
is
actually
rather
refreshing
nowadays
most
of
the

the
higherups
claim
i
dont

i

its

the
repeated

is
peculiar
lets
say
you

they

photographers

from
compound
relay
of
coverage
seen
there
was
a
press
conference
by
authorities
at
the
compound
on
cnn
earlier
today
wednesday
it
was
explained
that
two
news
photographers
were
found
on
the
compound
earlier
this
morning
without
permission
it
was
explained
to
the
press
corps
that
this
is
dangerous
and
that
an
unknown
photographer
turning
around
with
a
long
lens
camera
could
be
mistaken
for
someone
dangerous
by
a
texas
ranger
surveying
the
site
the
two
photographers
were
said
to
be
currently
in
jail
and
the
press
were
warned
to
follow
the
authorities
guidelines
it
was
also
emphasized
that
the
survey
of
the
crime
scene
at
this
point
was
crucial
and
that
the
press
could
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
the
press
will
not
be
allowed
in
until
the
bodies
are
removed
and
the
site
has
been
completely
surveyed
for
evidence
for
a
court
case
that
is
the
gist
of
the
beginning
of
the
conference
to
the
best
of
my
memory
i
bring
this
up
because
i
havent
seen
anyone
else
note
it
and
i
havent
seen
the
regular
newscasts
mention
it
it
will
probably
be
mentioned
in
the
papers
tomorrow
my
opinions
i
find
this
disturbing
while
i
believe
that
koresh
is
largely
responsible
for
not
ending
this
standoff
in
a
peacable
manner
during
the
last
days
of
patient
opportunity
i
find
the
secrecy
surrounding
the
aftermath
more
damaging
to
the
authorities
position
than
they
realize
since
the
vast
majority
of
potential
defendents
in
a
court
case
are
already
dead
the
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
building
the
court
case
seems
overblown
to
me
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
hearings
on
this
affair
i
have
also
heard
congressional
calls
for
a
review
and
possible
overhaul
of
government
enforcement
agencies
which
you
will
recall
i
have
stated
would
be
a
good
idea
in
previous
months
please
also
note
that
i
by
no
means
endorse
or
agree
with
the
many
conspiracytype
theories
i
have
read
here
and
in
other
groups
as
usual
i
am
basing
my
opinions
on
info
gathered
from
various
media
and
filtered
by
my
own
common
sense
and
consideration
of
plausibility
imho
as
such
my
opinion
is
subject
to
change
as
more

is

days
you
people
are
rather
amusing
in
a
perverse
sort
of
way
you
take
a
tragicunpleasant
situation
that
you
feel
is
a
terrible
injustace
and
assign
blame
to
anybody
and
everybody
with
or
without
a
link
to
the
incident
simply
because
they
dont
fit
your
extremely
narrow
definition
of
good
how
is
clinton
responsible
it
was
a
law
enforcement
action
granted
it
was
a
nationally
covered
incident
but
clinton
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
outcome
than
fred
flintstone
perhaps
youve
been
under
a
rock
the
last
few
days
the
batf
and
the
fbi
are
both
federal
agencies
clinton
has
admitted
in
front
of
news
cameras
that
janet
reno
the
once
and
future
attorney
general
gave
him
a
full
briefing
of
what
was
planned
before
they
did
it
and
he
gave
her
the
go
ahead
maybe
just
possibly
that
makes
him
a
teensy
bit
responsible
the
fbi
cia
batf
etc
are
federal
agencies
you
are
correct
but
to
think
there
is
a
visible
and
clear
chain
of
command
up
to
the
prez
and
that
these
agencies
inform
reno
who
informs
clinton
etc
is
naive
these
agencies
operate
as
distinct
and
seperate
entities
and
while
they
have
ultimate
accountability
to
the
prez
they
make
their
own
moves
and
then
tell
the
prez
who
says
i
knew
all
along
while
this
may
not
seem
right
or
it
may
not
fit
our
idealistic
need
to
see
a
structured
chain
of
command
leading
to
the
white
house
thats
the
way
it
is
bureaucracys
are
not
after
all
composed
of
or
people
who
talk
on
a
regular
basis
have
lunch
and
maybe
golf
together
i
do
agree
the
fbi
batf
messed
up
im
not
sure
if
they
should
have
stormed
the
compound
or
not
by
the
way
jehova
witnesses
are
a
religious
minority
in
this
country
protestantism
is
a
minority
religion
in
the
world
bds
were
a
cult
by
all
definitions
and
history
of
cults
to
say
this
is
not
to
persecute
a
religious
or
ethnic
enclave
koresh
said
he
was
the
messiah
i
was
raised
a
baptist
although
i
do
not
practice
the
religion
and
do
not
think
that
the
big
guy
upstairs
is
digging
the
divisiveness
closemindedness
and
rightwing
morons
that
are
associated
with
the
religion
anyway
the
messiah
that
i
was
taught
about
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
let
alone
stockpiling
weapons
you
can
doubt
batf
reports
all
you
want
david
koresh
was
not
a
poor
soul
who
was
unjustly
persecuted
while
some
of
the
information
coming
from
the
us
government
is
being
exagerated
so
as
keep
public
opinion
on
their
side
i
do
believe
that
some
of
the
things
that
former
cult
members
have
said
are
true
anyway
this
is
just
another
excuse
to
try
and
blame
president
clinton
for
something
people
who
attempt
to
do
this
for
political
motives
should
be
ashamed
they
are
the
ones
who
are
keeping
this
country
from
reaching
its
full
potential

believe
that
the

was
handled
fairly
well
with
the

exception
of
the

i
think

suppose
they

is

however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
tolerent
arent
we
theirs
was
hardly
the
first
faithsectcult
to
espouse
this
type
of
belief
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
i
keep
hearing
this
and
while
ill
agree
that
he
should
have
come
out
legally
that
was
his
best
option
he
didnt
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
legal
provision
for
were
tired
of
this
shit
lets
just
kick
some
ass
so
i
have
a
question
for
you
here
goes
i
come
up
to
you
and
point
a
gun
at
you
saying
im
going
to
count
to
ten
if
you
arent
standing
on
your
head
by
then
ill
kill
you
you
believe
that
standing
on
your
head
is
the
road
to
damnation
so
you
dont
do
it
you
are
now
dead
is
it
my
fault
for

a

that

to

the

are

breaks
down
a
good
samaritan
stops
to
help
when
you
find
you
and
your

at
gunpoint
or
knifepoint
how
will
you
defend
yourself
and
your
family
you
are

walking
alone
to
your
car
or
home
a
man
appears
suddenly
with
the
intent
to
rape
you
how
will
you
defend
yourself
are
you
strong
enough
to
fight
off
your
attacker
are
you
willing
to
let
this
man
rape
you
in
order
to
survive
the
attack
if
the
house
and
senate
have

we
will
soon
not
have
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
as
provided
by
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
a
gun
may
not
be
the
answer
to
each
and
every
dangerous
situation
but
are
you
going
to
let
the
politicians
decide
what
sort
of
force
or
weapon
you
may
use
to
defend
yourself
and
your
family
many
times
a
situation
may
be
diffused
by
just
brandishing
your
handgun
if
certain
members
of
the
house
and

have
their

ammunition
will
be
banned

his

family
members
have

our
local
police
do
an
excellent

but
they
can

be

all
the

in

should
have
the

to
protect
yourself

that
really
depends

this

you
would

if
it

narrow

good
very

narrow
if
youll

i
was
the
nut
that
advocated
the
possibility

tactical

being
militia
weapons
in

how
can
you
possibly
define
what
is

and
what
isnt

only
the
start
of
this
and
also
on
if
you
intend
the
law
to
be
reflective
of
modern
practice
five
months
or
five
centuries
down
the
road
i
would
hope
so
lets
define
a
nuclear
weapon
as
an
explosive
weapon
whose
majority
of
energy
comes
from
fission
andor
fusion
of
atomic
nuclei
and
youve
just
described
any
civilian
reactor
because
your
definition
fails
to
note
what
energy
is
being
considered
reactors
blow
with
a
steam
explosion
but
the
majority
of
energy
still
comes
from
fission
or
fusion
because
that
is
what
heated
the
coolant
see
what
a
can
of
worms
this
is
last
i
heard
ft
calhoun
station
just
north
of
omaha
nebraska
wasnt
considered
a
weapon
given
the
sodiumcooled
breeder
designs
on
the
blocks
now
i
can
easily
envision
reactors
being
household
appliances
in
under
twenty
years
with
the
prism
design
there
is
no
operator
input
needed
on
the
reactor
itself
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
the
secondary
side
can
be
made
equally
as
automatic
in
the
future
so
your
definition
is
flawed
in
a
few
respects
already
lets
define
a
biological
weapon
as
live
organisms
or
viruses
in
such
state
quantity
and
with
such
a
vector
that
they
could
cause
death
or
serious
disease
further
defined
to
a
significant
number
of
people
if
released
in
a
city
similarly
populated
area
resevoir
or
cropland
typhoid
mary
would
likely
fit
this
bill
if
she
sneezed
if
you
dont
mind
extrapolation
any
hivpositive
person
also
fits
this
bill
if
they
interact
with
others
in
a
way
that
stands
any
chance
of
spreading
the
virus
finally
that
manure
pile
i
mention
below
fits
this
definition
as
does
say
releasing
a
pet
rattlesnake
to
the
wild
nerve
gas
and
mustard
gas
are
well
defined
other
poisonous
gasses
should
be
individually
banned
only
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
no
use
not
related
to
weaponry
licenses
should
be
available
for
research
purposes
on
such
chemicals
and
i
can
show
where
any
such
gas
has
other
uses
for
example
perhaps
we
would
like
to
rid
the
hay
field
of
gophers
calcium
carbide
is
a
rock
that
dissolves
in
water
to
produce
aceteylne
gas
it
can
be
used
for
welding
in
miners
lamps
for
gassing
gophers
or
for
making
carbide
bombs
and
doing
some
illicit
fishing
toss
some
in
a
toilet
and
leave
a
lighted
cigarette
on
the
seat
and
youll
see
that
it
can
also
be
a
weapon
just
like
any
other
flammable
substance
so
now
my
miners
lamps
wont
work
i
cant
do
any
welding
and
i
still
have
those
pesky
gophers
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
these
ideas
could
certainly
be
a
basis
for
definitions
the
basis
for
but
im
sure
you
see
that
the
problem
is
not
in
writing
a
law
it
is
in
writing
a
law
that
cannot
be
abused
and
extended
beyond
the
point
where
it
does
any
good
ill
give
you
a
little
hint
see
that
manure
pile
in
the
farmers
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
nope
it
is
not
considered
a
weapon
it
is
under
your
proposed
law
so
is
a
silage
pit
if
there
is
runoff
so
are
underground
fuel
tanks
biological
in
nature
because
if
it
gets
washed
into
an
open
well
it
will
contaminate
the
aquifers
that
supply
thousands
of
cities
with
drinking
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
has
ruled
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illegal
care
to
draw
a
thinner
line
this
time
it
is
not
defined
as
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
many
things
are
banned
for
other
reasons
it
meets
all
the
criterion
of
a
weapon
it
is
an
instrument
that
can
be
used
for
fighting
even
though
that
is
not
its
intended
purpose
and
despite
there
being
better
weapons
around
given
that
the
aquifers
supply
a
significant
part
of
the
country
with
drinking
water
mass
destruction
is
rather
a
given
its
not
that
certain
weapons
arent
something
id
rather
not
see
a
lot
of
people
having
the
problem
is
that
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
write
a
law
such
that
it
cannot
be
abused
upon
some
pretext
or
another
the
looser
your
definition
the
more
ripe
for
abuse
that
law
is
furthermore
if
you
get
specific
then
the
old
standby
is
to
insert
a
clause
allowing
the
list
of
banned
things
to
be
added
to
generally
without
going
through
the
hassles
of
another
vote
and
public
reading
of
the
law
again

for
abuse

have
begun
killing
everyone
in

a
press
release
stated
this
action
was
required
because
bugs
had
revealed
that
many
people
were
doing
something
illegal
in
their
homes
and
statistical
data
indicated
that
those
who
werent
might
someday

an

just

stated
that
this

once

for

this
is
satire
the
jury
is
still
out
also
yesterday
even
though
the

no

the
us
attorneys
office
here
released
formerly
sealed
documents
including
a
search
warrant
and
related
affidavits
that
authorities
planned
to
use
when
the

was
over
these
documents
did
not
include
the
original

the

had
in
late
february
which
to
this
day
have
never
been
released
one
of
the
documents
indicated
the
agency
planned
to
seek
samples
of
koreshs
handwriting
not
only
to
verify
that
he
had
signed
for
some
gun
purchases
but
also
that
he
espoused
certain
doctrines
hostile
to
law
enforcement
and
particularly
the
atf
so
one
of
the
charges
against
koresh
seems
to
be
contempt
of
cop
he
expressed
hostility
to

don
kates
talk
on
the
branch
davidians
this
was
posted
by
lyn
bates
to
the
firearmspolitics
mailing
list
i
recently
learned
that
don
kates
was
going
to
be
in
boston
to
give
a
talk
at
the
harbard
law
school
about
the
waco
situation
of
course
this
was
all
set
up
after
the
incident
started
but
long
before
its
unhappy
conclusion
so
yesterday
i
went
to
hear
him
what
follows
is
a
rough
summary
of
what
i
think
i
heard
him
say
which
should
not
be
taken
as
exactly
what
he
actually
said
kates
started
by
saying
that
since
he
didnt
know
any
more
about
the
fire
than
the
audience
did
it
had
just
happened
the
day
before
he
would
not
discuss
that
but
would
concentrate
on
the
original
raid
koresh
definitely
was
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
but
so
what
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
the
leader
of
a
new
small
religious
group
has
been
ridiculed
by
the
public
extreme
religious
views
nearly
always
fuel
hatred
and
mistrust
the
first
amendment
applies
maybe
especially
to
people
like
koresh
lengthy
digression
into
the
history
of
police
organizations
in
the
us
there
were
none
until
about
when
they
began
in
metropolitan
areas
police
originally
were
not
armed
if
they
found
a
crime
in
progress
they
called
local
armed
citizens
to
help
many
began
to
carry
arms
for
protection
despite
regulations
against
them
eventually
the
laws
were
changed
to
allow
them
to
carry
guns
the
original
intent
was
to
have
many
small
police
departments
jealous
of
one
another
and
competitive
but
not
large
enough
to
be
a
threat
to
liberty
hence
the
plethora
of
organizations
ranging
from
postal
inspectors
to
the
coast
guard
when
the
fbi
was
started
agents
did
not
have
the
authority
oto
carry
guns
they
were
to
be
after
all
a
bureau
of
investigation
not
a
police
force
all
police
agencies
will
be
misused
by
anyone
in
power
to
maintain
that
power
the
batf
started
as
a
tax
collection
agency
whose
primary
job
was
to
raid
illegal
stills
when
the
price
of
sugar
went
up
so
high
that
moonshiners
no
longer
found
their
trade
no
longer
profitable
many
illegal
stills
disappeared
and
the
batf
needed
something
else
to
do
to
justify
its
existence
so
it
turned
to
activities
like
phony
raids
on
gun
stores
around
the
time
when
the
batfs
annual
budget
is
under
review
the
media
is
alerted
by
the
batf
to
come
to
suchandsuch
a
place
where
at
a
prearranged
time
a
bunch
of
cars
full
of
batf
agents
roar
up
to
the
door
and
the
media
get
great
pictures
of
the
agents
entering
the
premises
of
a
gun
dealer
suspected
of
not
keeping
books
properly
the
media
isnt
invited
in
for
the
boring
hours
of
agents
leafing
through
paperwork
but
if
any
irregularities
are
found
the
media
gets
to
cover
the
agents
removing
armfuls
of
guns
from
the
premises
and
the
luckless
ffl
in
chains
the
waco
incident
happened
a
few
weeks
before
batfs
budget
was
up
for
review
kates
opinion
is
that
it
was
a
staged
publicity
stunt
that
went
bad
and
that
the
batf
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
would
actually
be
shot
at
or
they
would
have
planned
the
raid
differently
not
sending
agents
over
open
ground
with
no
cover
for
example
and
would
have
had
some
medical
personnel
on
hand
he
confirmed
that
some
years
ago
there
was
a
warrant
for
koreshs
arrest
in
connection
with
a
murder
charge
and
the
local
sheriff
called
him
on
the
phone
and
explained
about
it
koresh
sais
ok
come
pick
me
up
and
the
sheriff
did
temporarily
confiscating
all
the
guns
so
that
they
could
be
tested
koresh
was
later
cleared
release
and
presumably
got
his
guns
back
at
least
at
that
time
he
was
rational
enough
to
be
approached
rationally
and
behaved
in
a
reasonable
manner
the
batf
didnt
take
into
account
that
unlike
most
of
the
ffls
they
audit
koresh
was
actually
paranoid
and
fostered
paranoia
in
his
followers
thus
the
pubicity
stunt
looked
like
a
real
attack
to
them
and
they
reacted
accordingly
with
respect
to
the
original
warrant
it
had
not
been
unsealed
when
kates
was
giving
his
talk
so
he
could
not
comment
on
it
except
to
mention
that
the
batf
has
been
known
to
not
doublecheck
the
veractiy
of
their
informants
if
they
can
manage
to
get
a
judge
to
issue
a
warrant
he
had
more
to
say
about
the
way
the
warrant
was
served
which
may
have
been
completely
illegal
apparently
the
proper
way
to
serve
a
warrant
is
to
knock
on
the
door
and
announce
that
youre
an
officer
with
a
warrant
for
thusandso
if
they
dont
open
the
door
and
the
evidence
is
flushable
then
it
is
ok
to
break
in
the
door
but
since
it
is
hard
to
flush
guns
down
the
toilet
there
may
have
been
no
justification
for
the
batf
breaking
in
the
way
they
did
if
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
davidians
were
violated
by
an
invalid
warrant
or
by
an
improperly
served
warrant
then
the
davidians
may
have
been
justified
in
their
actons
a
close
look
at
one
of
the
original
films
shows
that
one
batf
agent
may
have
shot
himself
by
accident
when
entering
the
building
if
so
this
was
the
first
shot
fired
the
role
of
the
media
could
have
been
a
whole
lot
worse
after
an
initial
position
on
the
side
of
the
batf
the
media
began
to
come
around
to
the
view
that
this
might
be
a
situation
in
which
legally
armed
citizens
held
off
a
bad
possibly
illegal
attack
a
real
cynic
might
say
that
the
fbi
went
in
when
they
did
because
it
was
clear
that
public
opinion
was
beginning
to
change
sides
and
the
fbi
wanted
to
act
before
they
lost
the
publics
sympathy
should
the
batf
be
abolished
no
police
agencies
should
be
numerous
diverse
inefficient
decentralized
etc
better
a
few
inept
accidents
like
this
than
a
move
toward
a
single
large
wellorganized
welltrained
powerful
domestic
police
force
which
would
eventually
have
even
more
tragic
results

both

attack

that

last

reno
stated
that
they
had
evidence
of

she
would
not
say
what
it
was
koreshs
now
exlawyer
was
inside
the
compound
repeatedly
and
told
her
to
her
face
last
night
that
he
saw
plenty
of
happy
children
playing
with
their
mothers
and
no
signs
of
child
abuse
whatsoever
no
brooding
silent
children
no
apparent
bruising
and
so
on
her
reply
to
this
was
that
child
abuse
is
not
always
as
evident
as
that
true
but
what
better
evidence
could
the

have
had
at
this

it

abuse

find

rather
curious
wasnt

that
certainly
had

that

arose
after

so

fail

fbi
directors
statement
on
waco
standoff
i
had
hoped
to
be
making
a
very
different
statement
this
evening
after
very
careful
planning
and
extensive
preparation
we
all
thought
that
todays
efforts
by
the
fbi
to
bring
the
branch
davidians
out
of
their
compound
would
result
in
the
peaceful
resolution
of
the
standoff
or
at
least
meaningful
negotiation
instead
we
are
faced
with
devastation
and
death
however
i
have
no
question
that
our
plan
was
correct
and
was
conducted
with
extreme
professionalism
and
care
i
applaud
the
restraint
shown
by
agents
in
the
face
of
lifethreatening
gunfire
and
i
thank
them
for
risking
their
lives
to
try
to
end
this
peacefully
i
have
only
the
greatest
admiration
for
the
courage
and
professionalism
of
all
involved
i
have
no
question
that
our
plan
was
correct
months
to
get
ready
unlimited
funds
knowledge
of
a
threatened
mass
suicide
by
fire
and
no
fire
trucks
on
hand
this
is
extreme
professionalism
and
care
i
can
understand
the
first
screwedup
raid
by
the
batf
they
underestimated
the
opposition
which
happens
but
not
this
one
the

had
their

massive
resources
ample
time
for
planning

bringing
up
any
specialized
equipment
or
people
necessary
they
still
botched
it
the
fbi
director
and
the
fbi
sac
in
overall
charge
should
resign
or
be
fired
for
incompetence
i
dont
blame
reno
or
clinton
they
gave
the
fbi
clear
orders
dont
go
in
unless
you
can
do
it
without

if
you
cant
do
that
wait

were

even

the

so
the
only
way
the
batffbi
could

is
by

the
paucity
of

is
that

texas
state

they

did

peaceably
the
could

did

koresh
was

note
that

are
state
matters

the
state
could

did
handle
them
properly

peaceably

furthermore
violating
no

the

sadly
these

the

the

will
just
whitewash
this

chalk
it
up
as
being
solely
david
koreshs
fault
sadder
still
the
american
people
will
probably
believe
them
next
question
the
problem
is
of
course
the
laws
that
allow
a
bunch
of
raving
nutters
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arms
in
the
first
place
this
is
not
the
problemthe
problem
is
that
we
have
a
government
that
is
becoming
more
tyrannical
every
day
if
people
decide
to
own
guns
and
live
in
one
place
together
then
that
is
their
prerogative
on
the
other
hand
if
the
bds
were
in
posession
of
explosives
and
illegal
guns
then
the
government
did
have
the
right
to
search
their
compound
but
the
allegations
that
the
bds
were
in
posession
of
illegal
weapons
hasnt
been
proven
yet
so
im
not
going
to
conclude
that
the
bds
broke
any
laws
david
koresh
was
accused
of
abusing
children
but
if
this
is
his
only
crime
then
the
presence
of
the
atf
cant
be
justified
the
atf
is
only
supposed
to
deal
with

tobacco

alcohol
violations

actions

better
yet
they

imo
the
sequence
of
events
meant
that
there
really
was
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervention
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mounted
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempted
to
save
the
children
by

all
the

koreshs
lawyer
seemed
to
think
that
everyone
would
come
out
peacefully
sooner
or
later
the
fbi
and
atf
had
nothing
but
time
on
their
hands
why
did
they
have
to
escalate
the
situation
and
cause
this
senseless
tragedy
their
job
is
to
protect
the
public
and
save
lives
not
kill
people
for
crying
out
loud
it
really
was
a
no
win
situation
koresh
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
officers
instead
he
ordered
the
murder
of
the
children
dont
be
so
sure
about
that
i
read
in
a
newspaper
today
that
one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
when
one
of
the
tanks
went
through
the
wall
that
it
knocked
over
a
lantern
which
caused
the
ranch
house
to
be
caught
on
fire
this
cult
member
also
said
that
david
koresh
had
no
intentions
of
committing
mass
suicide
david
koreshs
lawyer
also
confirms
this
therefore
if
this
is
true
then
this
means
that
the
fbi
and
atf
murdered
everyone
in
that
house
even
if
this
is
not
true
the
fbi
and
atf
still
dont
get
off
the
hook
because
they
waited
a
damn
long
time
to
call
the
waco
fire
department
perhaps
they
wanted
all
these
people
to
die
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessary
to
beleive
the
words
of
a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the
suicidemurder
of
his
other
followers
according
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempted
to
serve
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
youre
wrong
on
several
accounts
atf
agents
were
adequately
armed
they
had
and
shotguns
some
agents
were
armed
with
automatic
pistols
but
not
all
were
the
atfs
initial
claimwhich
they
later
retractedthat
agents
were
underarmed
is
simply
ludicrous
the
bd
seige
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
indefinitely
the
bd
were
quite
capable
of
commiting
mass
suicide
and
murdering
the
children
at
any
time
a
commando
assault
was
the
only
other
likely
action
that
could
have
achieved
that
objective
that
would
have
been
very
risky
orders
of
magintude
harder
than
antebbe
or
the
iranian
embassy
seige
airplanes
and
embassies
are
not
designed
for
defense
against
attack
ranch
apocalypse
was
terrorists
are
far
easier
to
disloge
without
casualties
than
allowing
the
siege
to
go
on
was
not
an
option
either
besides
the
serious
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
any
moment
there
was
the
question
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
the
emmergency
team
on
standby
over
a
prolonged
period
the
longer
the
siege
went
on
the
more
mentally
prepared
koresh
and
his
followers
would
be
for
a
prolonged
siege
rather
than
go
in
prematurely
the
mistake
was
probably
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
getting
the
children
out
a
certain
way
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legislation
through
gun
control
isnt
the
only
issue
here
if
the
sick
little
monkeys
in
washington
try
to
use
the
waco
incident
as
a
reason
to
ban
guns
then
they
will
have
demonstrated
just
how
fed
up
they
are
what
concerns
me
much
more
than
new
gun
control
legislation
is
that
the
government
seems
to
be
able
to
get
away
with
st
like
they
did
in
wacothey
are
becoming
more
and
more
callous
about
peoples
rights
and
the
law
this
greatly
disturbs
me
and
it
should
disturb
you
as
well
this
conspiracy
theory
assumes
that
the
batf
deliberately
got
of
its
agents
killed
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actually
enjoy
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
texas
being
shot
at
by
religious
nutters
still
the
conspiracy
theory
is
comforting
it
allows
them
to
pretend
that
waco
proves
nothing
except
about
how
incompetent
the
government
is
in
resolving
a
hostage
crisis
no
govt
in
the
world
has
ever
faced
a
comparable
situation
quite
probably
there
was
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peacefully
resolved
the
blame
does
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
koresh
was
allowed
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tipped
the
bd
off
in
advance
has
the
murder
of
atf
agents
and
children
on
his
or
her
conscience
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
us
who
predict
the
end
of
society
preach
salvation
through
armed
security
the
fact
is
that
these
are
the
very
people
who
pose
the
threat
to
society
in
the
first
place
the
next
waco
may
not
be
religious
nutters
but
a
political
movement
a
splinter
group
of
the
klu
klux
klan
taking
over
a
schoolhouse
in
a
black
area
for
example
and
holding
several
hundred
children
hostage
the
only
possible
solution
to
such
situations
that
can
work
is
to
prevent
them
arising
no
other
government
in
the
world
has
faced
such
a
situation
this
is
because
no
other
government
has
so
carelessly
allowed
high
power
weaponry
to
become
avaliable
to
any
little
hitler
or
would
be

i
agree
that

was

much
of
a
victim
as
a
perpetrator
this
because
he
grew
up
inside
the
cult
and
engaged
in
a
power
struggle
where
his
supporters
helped
inflate
his
ego
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
a
loose
fucking
cannon
with
a
shitload
of
serious
weapons
or
that
he
was
banging
thirteen

twisting

this

kerosene

no

i

maybe
they
wanted

he

gun
buyback

will
hopefully
have
an
impact
on
accidental
shootings
especially
youths
domestic
disputes
where
a
gun
is
available
in
the
heat
of
emotion
and
anger
and
maybe
keep
a
few
guns
from
being
stolen
and
later
used
in

what
gives
you
the
idea
that

will
have
an

on
any
of
these
things
evidence
please
please
dont
misinterret
what
i
was
saying
joe
i
was
making
the
point
tha
there
is
no
evidence
of
effect
of
gun
buyback
programs
but
hopefully
if
there
is
any
effect
it
may
prevent
injuries
or
deaths
in
one
of
these
types
of
common
incidents
if
youre
a
research
associate
in
urban
child
research
then
perhaps
you
can
comment
for
us
on
the
ratio
of
the
accidental
gun
death
rate
to
the
rate
of
accidental
death
from
other
single
causes
follow
that
perhaps
with
some
sort
of
justification
for
the
amount
of
effort
that
antigunners
spend
trying
to
convince
the
country
that
accidental
gunrelated
death
among
children
in
the
us
is
a
serious
problem
firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
more
than
anything
gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in
schools
between
amd
these
are
the
statistics
thus
willing
to
follow
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive

i
do
agree

not

if

not

jehova
witnesses
are
a
religious
minority
in
this
country
protestantism
is
a
minority
religion
in
the
world
bds
were
a
cult
by
all
definitions
and
history
of
cults
to
say
this
is
not
to
persecute
a
religious
or
ethnic
enclave
koresh
said
he
was
the
messiah
i
was
raised
a
baptist
although
i
do
not
practice
the
religion
and
do
not
think
that
the
big
guy
upstairs
is
digging
the
divisiveness
closemindedness
and
rightwing
morons
that
are
associated
with
the
religion
anyway
the
messiah
that
i
was
taught
about
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
let
alone
stockpiling
weapons
you
can
doubt
batf
reports
all
you
want
david
koresh
was
not
a
poor
soul
who
was
unjustly
persecuted
while
some
of
the
information
coming
from
the
us
government
is
being
exagerated
so
as
keep
public
opinion
on
their
side
i
do
believe
that
some
of
the
things
that
former
cult
members
have
said
are
true
anyway
this
is
just
another
excuse
to
try
and
blame
president
clinton
for
something
people
who
attempt
to
do
this
for
political
motives
should
be
ashamed
they
are
the
ones
who
are
keeping
this
country
from
reaching
its
full
potential
you
seem
to
make
two
points
no
one
ultimately
oversees
the
federal
agencies
you
mention
and
since
koresh
apparently
has
a
different
view
point
from
your
baptist
upbringing
then
he
is
not
worthy
of
protection
from
religious
persecution
as
to
being
the
messiah
is
not
christ
within
us
all
must
be
comforting
to
belong
to
a
government
approved
religion
baptists
are
a
cult

the

came
out
with
horse
trailers
men
ninja
uniforms
machine
guns
and
stun
grenades
and
used
them
before
koresh
could
even
look
at
the
warrant
koresh
fought
back
and
people
died
the
key
part
of
this
sentense
is
koresh
fought
back
this
was
his
big
mistake
when
the
police
decide
to
exert
their
authority
over
you
you
dont
fight
back
unless
you
want
people
to
get
hurt
you
cease
all
resistance
and
signal
your
submission
to
their
authority
the
cops
they
are
the
boss
you
are
the
subject
the
concept
of
defense
against
illegal
action
under
color
of
law
is
kaput
no
longer
is
it
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
its
government
of
the
people
by
the
biggest
guns
the
idea
of
sorting
it
out
in
court
later
is
fine
but
one
has
to
get
to
court
in
one
piece
to
do
that
korash
had
good
reason
to
think
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
that
chance
see
below
arent
in
it
to
beat
up
and
kill
people
in
spite
of
the
actions
of
a
few
bad
apples
if
you
quit
resisting
they
quit
hitting
perhaps
the
batf
did
over
react
to
the
threat
posed
by
koresh
perhaps
they
did
use
too
much
force
ok
fine
im
willing
to
concede
to
that
point
if
sufficient
proof
is
produced
and
i
admit
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
indicate
this
however
resisting
the
batf
is
the
worst
thing
koresh
could
have
done
if
they
hadnt
resisted
there
is
a
good
chance
that
no
one
would
have
been
hurt
remeber
they
were
using
stun
grenades
not
antipersonnel
grenades
if
the
bds
were
not
in
violation
of
any
rember
korash
didnt
get
to
sort
this
all
out
serenely
typing
at
his
keyboard
he
heard
some
kind
of
explosives
go
off
he
saw
he
was
being
attacked
with
no
overt
action
from
him
yet
he
could
no
more
say
oh
its
ok
its
only
stun
grenades
anymore
than
i
could
he
slammed
the
door
at
that
point
and
proceeded
to
repel
the
attackers
he
felt
in
genuine
fear
of
his
life
i
know
i
would
be
in
fear
of
my
life
at
that
point
have
you
ever
been
shot
at
how
clear
and
logically
could
you
think
under
that
pressure
when
you
might
have
all
of
or
seconds
to
evaluate
what
is
going
on
and
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
law
enforcements
intended
to
bring
in
their
suspect
horizontally
for
all
we
know
he
was
informed
by
someone
saying
something
like
hey
guy
the
batf
is
coming
like
gangbusters
and
they
mean
to
waste
you
according
to
the
latest
news
the
released
warrant
so
we
are
told
said
the
reason
for
this
ww
iii
raid
was
that
korashs
group
had
spent
around
on
firearms
and
related
stuff
over
an
undetermined
period
now
even
assuming
that
the
figure
isnt
calculated
like
the
feds
do
a
drug
siezure
for
people
that
isnt
really
all
that
much
you
priced
decent
guns
lately
hell
i
can
think
of
a
person
right
now
that
probably
has
that
much
for
one
individual
mostly
machineguns
sure
he
is
an
avid
collector
but
unless
a
new
law
has
been
passed
it
is
not
illegal
nor
an
indication
of
anything
illegal
to
have
a
lot
of
guns
also
note
that
the
warrant
had
nothing
to
say
about
machine
guns
so
what
is
the
justification
of
this
cowboy
raid
other
than
a
romp
gone
bad
for
some
antigun
media
hype
to
support
clintons
push
for
disarming
the
unconnected
citizen
of
any
and
all
effective
defensive
weapons
this
administration
has
only
one
thing
in
mind
control
people
control
whether
it
is
gun
control
clinton
cripple
chip
national
smart

it

can
you
say
only
years
late
i
knew
you
could
laws
they
would
have
been
released
as
they
had
been
before
if
this
had
happened
and
it
turned
out
that
the
batf
had
used
too
much
force
then
the
bds
would
have
grounds
for
a
law
suit
and
for
federal
charges
of
civil
rights
violations
sounds
a
lot
like
la
huh
dont
take
that
wrong
im
not
commenting
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
rodney
king
case
but
thats
not
what
they
wanted
they
got
tipped
off
that
the
batf
was
on
the
way
in
and
rather
than
adopting
a
nonviolent
nonthreatening
posture
to
greet
the
batf
they
decided
to
fight
and
batf
knew
the
bds
were
expecting
them
via
minutes
report
but
they
decided
they
were
so
big
so
bad
they
would
have
a
cakewalk
at
the
bds
expense
for
a
nice
media
show
anyway
but
it
all
turned
to
shit
and
the
fbi
taking
over
to
manage
things
we
see
it
all
turned

too

bah

among
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
any
death
is
serious
wanna
discuss
match
control
firearms
related
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
negligent
persons
not
the
gun
more
than
anything
gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
providing
false
hope
then
is
the
intent
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in
schools
between
amd
these
are
the
statistics
increase
in
california
schools
eh
gun
control
is
working
fine
there
thus
willing
to
follow
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive
thanks
for
the
reality
check
joe
its
been
real
so
your
religion
is
different
does
that
make

oh
ok
david
i
agree
that
koresh
was
as
much
of
a
victim
as
a
perpetrator
this
because
he
grew
up
inside
the
cult
and
engaged
in
a
power
struggle
where
his
supporters
helped
inflate
his
ego
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
a
loose
fucking
cannon
with
a
shitload
of
serious
weapons
or
that
he
was
banging
thirteen

twisting

kerosene

maybe
one

not
three

no
way
koresh
wasnt
just
talking
out
of
his
ass
i
expected
this
to
happen
maybe
they
wanted
it
to
look
like
murder
he
had
days
i
think
this
was
coming
the
whole
time
he
didnt
even
put
the

at

that
were
at

stupid

david
koreshs
religion
was
not
mine
but
then
again
neither
are
the
baptists
methodists
catholics
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
corporate
religions
but
even
though
koreshs
the
baptists
the
methodists
etc
dont
believe
the
same
way
i
do
i
recognize
that
their
religions
are
equally
valid
to
mine
and
more
importantly
are
equally
protected
under
the
amendment
you
see
im
not
that
much
different
than
koresh
and
i
suspect
many
others
fit
the
same
catagory
i
read
the
bible
many
times
and
as
i
learned
from
it
i
discovered
that
a
lot
of
what
corporate
religions
practice
just
isnt
justified
by
my
interpretation
of
the
bible
therefore
i
go
my
own
way
so
did
koresh
and
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
either
individually
or
collectively
as
the
great
socialist
we
has
any
right
whatsoever
to
tell
me
or
you
or
koresh
that
our
religions
are
wrong
you
seem
to
think
that
it
would
have
been
oh
so
easy
for
the
davidians
to
just
forsake
everything
they
believed
in
and
walk
out
of
their
compound
in
order
to
save
themselves
think
if
youre
capable
for
a
moment
about
some
belief
you
hold
dearest
would
you
abandon
that
belief
if
suddenly
told
to
do
so
by
the
government
if
you
would
do
so
you
are
beneath
contempt
lets
assume
you
have
a
belief
that
you
hold
dear
enough
to
commit
your
life
to
do
you
think
it
would
be
the
correct
course
of
action
for
your
government
to
initiate
actions
specifically
designed
to
force
you
to
make
that
forsake
or
die
decision
the
forsake
or
die
option
is
exactly
what
the
government
forced
on
the
davidians
the
day
the
first
wave
of
blackclad
stormtroopers
fired
that
first
shot

tossed

who
held

what
happened
in
waco
is
not
the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would
of
had
the
proper
equipment
and
personal
then
they
could
of
captured
the
compound
on
the
initial
assault
and
none
of
this
would
of
happened
they
did
have
the
proper
equipment
the
problem
is
that
they
went
about
things
the
wrong
way
the
atf
should
have
served
the
warrant
in
a
peacable
manner
instead
of
going
in
there
like
a
bunch
of
rambos
with
guns
blazing
im
not
trying
to
excuse
what
david
koresh
did
im
just
saying
that
the
atf
henceforth
to
be
known
as
the
cigarette
cops
went
about
the
raid
in
an
improper
manner
the
batf
needs
more
people
better
weapons
and
more
armored
transports
when
they
meet
hostile
fire
they
should
be
able
to
use
more
force
instead
of
retreating
to
a
stand
off
if
you
are
going
to
do
a
job
then
do
it
right
the
batf
is
there
to
protect
us
and
they
must
have
the
proper
equipment
and
people
to
do
the
job
let
the
fbi
customs
and
local
police
officers
do
the
atfs
job
we
dont
need
them
anymore
the
cigarette
cops
are
just
leftovers
from
prohibition
days
they
are
an
anachronism
with
the
wod
and
the
increased
crime
in
the
streets
the
batf
is
needed
more
now
then
ever
if
they
blast
away
a
few
good
fokes
then
that
is
the
price
we
all
have
to
pay
for
law
and
order
in
this
country
look
at
all
the
good
people
that
died
in
wars
to
protect
this
great
country
of
ours
including
you
what
if
the
cigarette
cops
kicked
down
your
door
and
cut
you
in
half
with
a
machine
gun
this
could
actually
happen
maybe
they
get
the
wrong
address
and
then
raid
your
home
for
example
its
happened
before
and
it
can
happen
again
i
have
heard
of
more
than
one
instance
of
a
noknock
raid
going
sour
just
recently
i
heard
about
a
case
in
which
police
raided
this
guys
home
because
they
thought
he
had
dope
or
something
the
guy
blew
both
of
the
officers
away
and
he
didnt
go
to
jail
for
it
the
judge
hearing
the
case
ruled
that
the
man
was
acting
in
selfdefense
with
the
arms
build
up
in
waco
they
needed
to
hit
that
compound
with
mega
fire
power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a
few
women
and
kids
but
it
would
of
been
better
then
letting
them
all
burn
to
death
days
later
are
you
sure
that
that
would
have
been
the
way
to
go
surely
the

there

closely

dave

does
that
include
the
right
to
murder
little
children
how
about
killing
atf
officers
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
gun
laws
in
texas
but
koreshs
folks
claimed
to
have
grenades
grenade
launchers
and
rocket
launchers
i
am
not
sure
that
the
nra
feels
that
this
falls
under
right
to
bear
arms
if
the
waco
wackos
truly
had
grenade
launchers
and
rocket
launchers
why
werent
they
used
against
the
armored
vehicles
that
attacked
their
house
all
the
media
stated
was
that
small
arms
ie
ineffective
fire
was
used
against
them
i
noticed
that
too
special
agent
asshole
actually
ricks
stated
that
david
koresh
had
explosives
that
could
blow
up
an
armored
vehicle
feet
into
the
air
it
looked
like
to
me
that
the
bds
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
use
these
explosivesprovided
that
they
had
them
in
the
first
place
for
example
when
one
of
the
tanks
was
injecting
cs
gas
into
the
ranch
house
yes
ranch
house
the
bds
werent
living
in
a
fortress
they
could
have
easily
destroyed
or
disabled
that
tank
because
it
was
idling
there
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
so
why
didnt
they
do
this
could
it
be
that
they
didnt
have
any
explosives
or
similar
munitions
i
just
dont
buy
what
the
atf
and
fbi
have
been
saying
hopefully
the
truth
will
come
out
heres
something
noteworthy
after
the
fire
had
been
burning
for
some
time
an
explosion
occurredjust
one
explosion
the
media
said
that
this
was
some
of
the
explosives
that
the
bds
posessed
going
off
i
dont
think
this
was
the
case
my
brother
and
i
noticed
that
this
socalled
explosion
resembled
a
plume
of
propane
gas
being
ignited
we
figure
that
this
is
what
it
was
because
of
how
the
explosion
looked
and
sounded
obviously
it
wasnt
due
to
something
like
tnt
dynamite
or
i
have
seen
a
propane
explosion
beforethe
explosion
in
the
ranch
house
greatly
resembled
this
also
i
noticed
something
that
looked
like
a
propane
tank
in
the
charred
ruble
the
next
day
isnt
it
curious
that
the
atf
wasnt
very
forthcoming
about
how
the
four
officers
got
killed
many
weeks
had
gone
by
before
they
stated
that
some
of
the
officers
had
been
killed
andor
wounded
by
grenades
thrown
by
the
bds
earlier
when
someone
asked
one
of
the
spokespersons
about
whether
or
not
an
autopsy
had
been
performed
on
the
slain
agents
they
said
that
an
autopsy
had
been
done
but
they
werent
ready
to
release
the
findings
now
why
is
this
does
the
atf
have
something
to
hide
perhaps
those
four
agents
were
killed
by
friendly
fire
what
is
the
cause
of
death
exactly
no
one
has
ever
said
what
it
is
what
is
certain
is
this
atf
agents
did
throw
grenades
into
the
compound
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr
koresh
handed
his
lawyer
a
grenade
body
during
one
of
the
lawyers
visits
to
the
compound
later
on
the
lawyer
gave
the
grenade
body
i
dont
know
if
it
was
a
dud
or
a
spent
one
btw
to
the
atf
how
much
do
you
want
to
bet
that
this
grenade
will
mysteriously
disappear
at
this
point
in
time
the
only
people
we
know
who
had
grenades
was
the
atf
agents
wouldnt
it
be
a
shocker
if
the
no
one
ever
found
any
evidence
of
grenades
rockets
or
explosives
in
the
rubble
the
atf
would
sure
have
egg
on
their
face
then
note
that
the
atf
is
doing
the
initial
sweep
of
the
rubble
the
fbi
and
the
texas
rangers
wont
investigate
until
the
atf
is
done
this
looks
like
a
perfect
opportunity
for
the
atf
to
make
sure
that
others
find
what
they
want
for
them
to
find
if
you
know
what
i
mean
im
probably

if
i

doesnt

in

previous

dbernardclesuncentralsuncom
dave
bernard
says
just
heard
on
the
network
radio
news
a
spokesman
from
the
army
saying
that
the
type
of
cs
gas
used
in
waco
had
been
banned
from
military
use
its
use
is
also
banned
by
a
draft
international
agreement
on
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
in
warfare
the
reason
given
was
that
the
use
causes
extreme
nausea
blindness
disorientation
total
irrationality
raging
paranoia
i
dont
know
about
the
paranoia
and
irrationality
but
the
rest
is
pretty
close
all
though
you
left
out
the
inability
to
breath
of
course
you
can
make
a
claim
that
people
will
do
some
fairly
deranged
things
to
get
away
from
it
ive
seen
teenagers
flatten
drill
sergeants
to
get
out
of
tents
full
of
it
which
raises
another
issue
children
would
be
all
the
more
susceptible
and
show
the
results
all
the
earlier
this
is
the
stuff
janet
reno
was
told
would
be
safe
for
children
what
they
didnt
mention
is
that
in
the
open
it
probably
wouldnt
do
too
much
harm
to
children
although
i
wouldnt
use
it
in
close
proximity
to
infants
on
the
other
hand
in
confined
spaces
the
effects
are
greatly
intensified
to
the
point
of
lethality
since
a
sufficient
quantity
of
cs
will
displace
oxygen
when
running
a
cs
chamber
careful
attention
is
paid
to
ventilation
i
wonder
if
they
checked
to
see
if
any
of
the
bds
were
asthmatics
or
suffered
from
other
respiratory
diseases
i
doubt
it
if
you
were
smarter
youd
have
these

subject
two
questions
id
appreciate
any
help
anyone
could
give
me
on
these
two
questions
the
brady
bill
was
in
the
news
throughout
but
what
actually
happened
to
it
in
congress
did
bush
veto
it
if
so
when
also
the
state
of
virginia
i
believe
just
passed
a
gun
control
bill
on
febrauary
of
this
year
i
think
it
limits
gun
purchases
to
one
a
month
is
this
correct
what
was
the
bill
number
anyone
subject
batf
fbi
do
right
thing
in
waco
everyone
is
complaining
about
the
debacle
in
waco
it
is
hard
to
understand
all
this
angst
what
happend
there
is
nothing
less
than
what
we
wanted
to
happen
why
all
the
sour
grapes
batf
was
looking
for
a
propaganda
event
to
counteract
their
impending
budget
cuts
the
attendance
of
the
press
at
the
initial
big
commando
raid
is
proof
it
would
have
been
ever
so
easier
to
grab
koresh
and
his
central
followers
as
they
shopped
in
waco
alas
no
propaganda
value
there
the
fbi
screwedup
big
time
all
the
time
they
should
have
never
allowed
the
situation
to
drag
out
like
that
a
quick
second
assault
before
the
bds
could
decide
on
a
strategy
would
have
been
the
better
plan
the
bds
themselves
were
the
biggest
screwups
though
they
imagined
that
us
law
and
us
lawenforcement
had
no
jurisdiction
within
their
little
country
wrong
they
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
fire
on
the
batf
and
if
they
mistook
their
identity
initially
they
should
have
surrendered
at
once
when
they
did
realize
who
they
were
if
the
bds
had
a
problem
with
the
warrants
they
take
it
to
court
just
like
the
rest
of
us
if
they
wanted
fullauto
weapons
they
could
have
obtained
the
proper
permits
just
like
the
rest
of
us
would
need
to
do
what
they
may
not
do
is
decide
for
themselves
what
us
law
applies
to
themselves
and
which
does
not
they
get
their
chance
like
the
rest
of
us
at
the
voting
booth
if
the
batf
and
fbi
have
become
latterday
gestapo
then
they
have
become
that
way
because
we
have
desired
them
to
be
so
we
get
to
vote
on
laws
and
on
the
lawmakers
by
our
choices
over
the
years
we
have
approved
the
creation
and
form
of
the
batf
and
fbi
when
the
fbi
was
out
chasing
pinkos
the
general
public
didnt
seem
to
mind
a
bit
of
extraconstitutional
activity
when
the
batf
is
raiding
militant
black
organizations
we
dont
mind
the
heavy
hand
when
the
fbi
is
dicking
around
with
the
rights
of
potheads
the
public
doesnt
mind
suddenly
when
we
see
a
bit
of
ourselves
in
the
current
enemy
choosen
by
these
agencies
we
get
all
bent

reap
what
you
sow
waco

encapsulation
of
the
allamerican
experience
religious
fanaticism
militaristic

and
overwhelming
violence
dont
blame
it

acting
within
the

the

known

about

wants
to
ban

and
just
about
everything
else
is
saying
the

had

then
falls

goverenment
line
about
how
the

were
into

so
on
am
i
having
a
vain
hope
that
an
honest

will
occur
on
this

will
it
simply
be
whitewashed
under

i
wonder
what
a
load
of
crap
the
bds
had
absolutely
no
right
to
fire
upon
the
batf
agents
if
they
didnt
know
who
they
were
at
first
then
they
should
have
surrendered
immediately
when
they
did
realize
who
they
were
dealing
with
little
groups
of
loonies
do
not
get
to
decide
just
what
laws
they
will
obey
or
disobey
or
what
sorts
of
warrants
are
justified
like
the
rest
of
us
they
get
their
say
at
the
voting
booth
and
if
their
personal
wants
are
not
backed
by
the
majority
of
voters
then
too
bad
if
they
wanted
to
keep
automatic
weapons
then
they
could
apply
for
the
proper
permits
if
they
had
a
problem
with
the
warrant
then
they
get
to
argue
that
in
court
in
no
event
do
they
get
to
establish
their
own
little
nation
inside
our
own
and
pretend
that
our
laws
and
lawenforcement
personel
have
no
jurisdiction
within
their
borders
you
live
on
us
territory
you
live
by
us
laws
period
unless
you
are
a
congressman
sure
the
situation
was
handled
badly
by
both
the
batf
and
the
fbi
it
would
have
been
all
so
easy
to
detain
koresh
and
his
core
members
while
they
were
out
in
the
streets
of
waco
the
batf
threatened
with
budget
cuts
was
trying
for
a
propaganda
coup
and
dragging
the
press
along
for
the
big
commandostyle
assault
is
proof
of
that
they
should
be
roasted
for
both
their
imcompetance
and
their
mindset
on
the
other
hand
they
did
have
the
legal
right
to
do
what
they
did
once
the
attack
was
begun
they
should
have
pressed
on
and
finished
it
rather
than
let
an
interminable
situation
like
that
take
root
the
fbi
also
used
poor
judgement
in
a
number
of
ways
but
again
the
laws
we
voters
have
approved
or
the
lawmakers
who
created
them
gave
them
the
right
to
do
what
they
did
if
batf
and
the
fbi
are
latterday
gestapo
it
is
because
the
voters
have
allowed
them
to
become
that
way
waco
was
pure
americana
militarist
mentality
religious
fanaticism
and
unadulterated
violence
all
rolled
into

in

will
clinton
start

will
he
try

squash
any
attempt

is
he
a

leader
or
is
he
only
interested
in
protecting
the

well
all
find
out
as
this
unfolds
excellent
point
mark
we
should
all
remember
that
if
nixon
hadnt
tried
to
cover
up
the
misguided
actions
of
some
of
his
subordinates
in
the
watergate
burglary
the
scandal
would
never
have
brought
down
his

so
far
klinton
seems
to
be
stonewalling
this
the
same
way
tricky
dick
did
his
whole
case
seems
to
be
we
didnt
do
anything
wrong
however
if
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
it
turns
out
that
the
govt
did
do
something
wrong
and
he
tried
to
cover
it
up
then
thats
an
impeachable
crime
i
believe
perhaps
he
is
inadvertently
cooking
up
his
own
scandal
can
you
say
wacogate
little
neighbor
ya
know
this
being
part
of
the
loyal
opposition
is
kinda
fun
for
a
change
i
sure
am
glad
i
get
to
bitch
about
clinton
rather
than
having
to
be
one

poor

if

accept

despite

i
find

that
so
many

seem
eager

suppose

why

no
i
dont
really
expect
a

but
then
again
that
is
how
mr

was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into

um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
if
people
will
believe
that

it

little
wonder
they
will
believe
all

is
there

this
is
where
freemans
love
of

becomes
really
ridiculous
good
now
lets
look
at
those
sections
theyll
prove
my
point
his
point
was
that
it
is
possible
under
certain
circumstances
for
many
people
to
carry
concealed
in
illinois
a
a
person
commits
the
offense
of
unlawful
use
of
weapons
when
he
knowingly
carries
or
possesses
in
any
vehicle
or
concealed
on
or
about
his
person
except
when
on
his
land
or
in
his
own
abode
or
fixed
place
of
business
any
pistol
revolver
stun
gun
or
taser
or
other
firearm
note
that
this
doesnt
affect
all
concealed
carry
look
after
the
word
except
it
always
helps
to
read
the
law
before
commenting
on
it
i
did
read
the
law
before
i
commented
on
it
judging
from
replies
i
received
about
my
semantics
on
tpg
post
many
if
not
most
people
here
on
tpg
assume
that
when
ccw
laws
are
asked
about
the
person
is
asking
about
the
possibility
of
an
ordinary
citizen
getting
one
it
would
also
follow
that
said
person
would
get
the
ccw
to
carry
on
hisher
person
away
from
their
home
andor
business
would
a
prudent
storekeeper
carry
concealed
how
about
someone
at
home
note
that
both
are
legal
and
a
lot
of
common
people
qualify
for
one
or
the
other
andy
maybe
freeman
did
prove
his
point
but
his
point
is
not
relevant
the
thing
that
most
people
seem
to
care
about
when
they
ask
questions
about
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
is
whether
or
not
they
can
carry
it
concealed
on
their
person
when
they
are
out
on
the
street
somewhere
im
sure
that
not
many
people
are
concerned
with
whether
or
not
they
can
carry
concealed
at
home
speaking
as
someone
who
lives
in
illinois
the
only
place
where
the
above
quoted
law
is
relevant
i
know
that
it
is
legal
to
own
a
handgun
here
i
am
not
taking
into
account
city
ordinances
i
could
care
less
about
whether
or
not
i
can
carry
concealed
at
home
i
only
care
about
the
fact
that
i
cant
carry
concealed
in
the
place
where
it
really
counts
out
on
the
street
freeman
loves
to
be
accurate
and
i
can
understand
that
especially
not
but
he
seems
to
be
forgetting
that
accurate
facts
dont
always
replace
common
sense
i
am
not
going
to
followup
to
this
thread
anymore
because
i
believe
that
it
is
useless
to
argue
these
points
anymore
the
only
thing
that
is
happening
now
is
that
freeman
and
i
are
running
around
in
circles
trying
to
prove
each
other
wrong
and
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
be
playing
games
anymore
of
course
now
freeman
will
attack
me
about
my
use
of
common
sense
in
some
of
my
earlier
posts
but
what
can
i
do
my
only
advice
for
freeman
quit
being
so
picky
about
accuracy
sometimes
and
use
your
common

it
really
does
work

primarily

quigley
author
of

the
article
in
turn
cites
a
misleading
statistic
that
was
originally
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
article
states
a
study
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
this
is
an
oftenquoted
statistic
and
it
is
misleading
for
sev
eral
reasons
outlined
below
the
study
gives
the
impression
that
if
you
own
a
gun
the
likelihood
that
you
will
successfully
use
it
to
defend
yourself
is
less
than
that
of
the
gun
being
turned
against
you
the
study
however
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
where
a
lawabiding
citizen
uses
a
gun
to
thwart
a
crime
without
actually
killing
the
perpe
trator
the
study
actually
refers
to
acquaintances
rather
than
friend
this
would
include
the
friendly
neigh
borhood
thug
who
shows
up
like
clockwork
every
month
the
second
your
grandmother
cashes
her
social
security
check
possibly
an
acquaintance
but
hardly
a
friend
the
nejm
study
is
based
on
the
immediate
dis
position
of
cases
and
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
originally
filed
as
homicides
that
were
later
ruled
to
be
selfdefense
especially
considering
the
small
sample
size
taking
these
events
into
account
has
a
sub
stantial
effect
on
the
ratio
quoted
criminologist
gary
kleck
gives
us
a
slightly
dif
erent
statistic
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
successfully
by
a
private
citizen
against
an
aggressor
than
it
is
to
kill
anyone
at
all
further
per
sons
defending
themselves
from
aggression
by
using
a
gun
fare
better
than
those
who
resist
vicimization
by
some
other
means
or
who
offer
no
resistance
at
all
statistics
available
from
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
also
show
that
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
by
a
noncriminal
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be
used
to
commit
criminal
homicide
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
defend
against
a
criminal
threat
than
to
accidentally
kill
anybody
and
times
more
likely
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be
used
to
commit
suicide
it
is
well
to
keep
in
mind
that
nearly
anything
can
be
proved
by
uncritical
quotation
of
statistics
one
has
to

carefully

ah
but
we
have

it
doesnt

what
is
the
point
we
cant
claim
that
it
is

as
people
do
get

the

are
essentially
saying
look

lying
around
and
you
dont

it
well
give

we
care

theyre

we

this

whatever
works

points
out
this

would

by
the
mass

however
here
is
my
proposal
offer
gun
safety
classes
in
your
area
free
as
a
community
service
such
a
class
would
normally
cost
or
so
offering
it
free
is
a
good
promotion
our
gun
club
has
organized
several
of
these
we
just
finished
teaching
another
one
last
night
in
fact
and
they
have
been
very
well
received
we
get
a
lot
of
people
who
are
novices
interested
in
guns
we
even
get
a
few
who
are
antigun
but
feel
they
should
know
something
about
gun
safety
since
members
of
their
family
keep
guns
at
home
teaching
such
a
course
gives
us
many
desirable
benefits
we
have
the
chance
to
teach
gun
safety
rules
this
increases
firearm
awareness
and
may
help
to
reduce
gun
accident
stats
a
gun
safety
class
is
politically
correct
and
likely
to
be
viewed
positively
by
the
public
and
the
media
most
of
the
students
are
normal
people
not
gun
enthusiasts
and
this
kind
of
class
gives
us
the
chance
to
give
them
a
gentle
introduction
to
firearms
some
of
the
students
are
enthusiastic
and
will
purchase
a
gun
and
become
more
involved
in
shooting
or
personal
defense
it
improves
the
public
perception
of
our
club
and
gun
owners
in
general
our
students
see
that
we
are
all
reasonable
nonaggressive
softspoken
people
which
helps
to
mitigate
the
standard
image
of
a
hardcore
gun
owner
even
antigun
students
sometimes
tell
us
they
have
something
new
to
think
about
with
regards
to
personal
gun
ownership
sharing
our
experience
with
others
is
a
lot
of
fun
our
course
is
the
standard
nracertified
home
firearm
safety
class
and
our
students
pay
only
for
materials
we
also
teach
the
nras
personal
protection
class
although
the
cost
is
higher
for
that
one
since
we
have
to
purchase
range
time
i
think
firearms
safety
classes
are
an
excellent

not

how
theyre
going

take
care
of
all

but
granted
up
to
that

hed
done
nothing
wrong
i
recognize

respect
that
then
the

discovers
he
doesnt

proper
permits
for
some
of

purchases
and
failed

pay
some

on
them
a

offense
if
true
then
several

come
forward

demand
that
previous
charges

abuse
be

there
have
been
interviews
with
some
parents
whose
children
were
in

at
some
point
these
parents
claimed
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
the
childrens
statements
supported
these
charges
a
local
offense
if
true
totally
outside
the
batfs
domain
was
it
a
noknock
i
really
havent
heard
anything
on
that

clearly
he
was
not

another
guy
minding
his
own

hell
give
them
all

in

if
they
dont

he
was

just
what
the

chose

youd

there
were

undertones
here
i
would
trust
my

judgement
i
didnt

so
reason
number
one
to
doubt
the
legal
statements
made
by
some
of
the
survivors
note
that
some
of
them
were
made
by
his
guard
wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained
killers
i
dont
believe
either
side
blindly
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some
redwhiteand

american
defending
his
home
against

brother
if
they
fired
first
without
announcing
in

beleivable

who
they
were
i

pound
on
your
door
and
claim
to
be
the

will
you
just
lay
down
and
take
it
if
i
do
then
he
could
be
justified

often
an

factor
in

is
not
likely
to

equally

that

now
im

sounds

you
doubt
your

you
sound
pretty
typical
in
this
respect
you
also
seem
to
think
that
youll
be
safe
or
safer
if
others
are
unarmed
this
is
dangerous
fantasy
twice
when
i
was
hiking
the
at
i
came
up
on
a
shelter
that
i
was
planning
on
staying
at
and
saw
someone
sitting
there
cleaning
his
gun
softly
i
backed
away
and
hiked
another
miles
to
get
out
of
there
ill
freely
admit
it
here
im
not
afraid
of
guns
im
afraid
of
people
that
bring
them
into
the
backcountry
then
you
are
in
need
of
some
form
of
therapy
not
necessarily
that
of
an
analyst
but
maybe
you
should
learn
about
guns
your
fear
is
seems
to
be
based
in
ignorance
and
false
knowledge
you
see
a
person
with
a
gun
and
you
feel
threatened
why
is
this
so
have
you
any
legitimate
basis
for
this
any
firsthand
experience
that
lends
validity
to
your
fears
or
are
your
fears
based
on
mediated
experience
ie
the
anecdotes
of
others
such
as
network
news
i
trust
you
can
see
the
lack
of
legitimacy
in
such
mediated
inputs
and
why
are
you
afraid
of
the
people
as
mentioned
above
forgive
me
but
you
sound
afraid
to
the
point
of
paranoia
perhaps
you
should
talk
to
someone
about
this
i
am
not
saying
this
to
be
rude
or
fascetious
but
i
think
anyone
with
fear
as
deep
and
baseless
as
yours
seems
to
be
needs
some
sort
of
help
living
in
fear
really
sucks
even
if
it
is
only
when
around
people
with

in

tell

that
society
work
cars
and
guns
should
really
not
be
mixed
i
just
tried
to
make
a
point
like
america
norway
has
some
spaces
you
have
to
cross
to
get
from
a
to
b
so
a
car
is
essential
in
most
parts
guns
on
the
other
hand
are
not
essential
in
norway
so
we
dont
argue
that
if
we
banned
guns
we
have
to
ban
cars
everyone
who
believe
that
hitler
and
could
be
avoided
if
there
were
more
guns
in
germany
in
the
please
read
some
history
is
this
discussion
about
banning
weapons
for
all
americans
or
making
it
harder
for
criminals
to
get
one
change
of
name
wrote
that
one
after
reading
the
first
postings
about
the
waco
incident
i
still
think
there
are
some
posters
should
move
their
post
to
altconspiracy
or
make
a
new
newsgroup
if
you
read
the
first
postings
after
the
waco
fire
you
should
see
who
i
mean
did
the
batf
get
the
warrant
for
a

only
or
was
there

child

for

doesnt
the

i
dont

about
cults
theres
no
language
problem
here
my
problem
is
with
religious
fanatics
claiming
to
be
god
is
just
a
little
bit
unsettling
stockpiling
several
years
supply
of
canned
foods
no
crime
here
and
enough
weapons
to
hold
off
a
company
no
crime
here
not
to
mention
the
atf
which
ed
up
in
the
first
place
and
talking
about
how
theyre
going
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
unbelievers
no
crime
here
also
no
substantiation
of
your
claim
that
koresh
said
this
i
for
one
have
never
heard
this
mentioned
before
where
did
you
hear
it
but
granted
up
to
that
moment
hed
done
nothing
wrong
i
recognize
and
respect
that
up
to
which
moment
the
one
where
you
decided
that
anyone
who
claims
to
be
god
no
longer
has
the
protection
of
the
constitution
what
happened
to
the
separation
of
church
and
state
then
the
atf
discovers
he
doesnt
have
proper
permits
for
some
of
his
purchases
and
failed
to
pay
some
taxes
on
them
i
have
yet
to
see
any
evidence
of
this
either
from
what
i
hear
the
original
warrant
the
reason
for
the
feb
raid
is
still
sealed
what
are
unsealed
seem
to
be
warrants
taken
out
after
the
initial
raid
then
several
parents
come
forward
and
demand
that
previous
charges
of
child
abuse
be
refiled
there
have
been
interviews
with
some
parents
whose
children
were
in
the
compound
at
some
point
funny
i
havent
seen
any
of
these
interviews
interesting
that
when
the
social
services
agencies
investigated
koresh
on
these
previous
charges
they
found
absolutely
no
evidence
of
abuse
these
parents
claimed
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
the
childrens
statements
supported
these
charges
funny
i
dont
remember
hearing
anything
about
childrens
statements
either
where
did
you
say
you
heard
all
this
what
i
heard
was
that
none
of
the
children
who
left
the
compound
early
in
the
seige
exhibited
any
signs
typical
of
abuse
physical
or
mental
this
from
the
newspaper
and
national
tv
news
did
you
also
hear
that
its
the
job
of
the
batf
and
the
fbi
to
lay
siege
to
homes
where
child
abuse
is
suspected
i
thought
you
did
was
it
a
noknock
i
really
havent
heard
anything
on
that
but
clearly
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his
own
business
clearly
please
tell
us
what
koresh
was
doing
that
can
be
construed
as
other
than
minding
his
own
business
before
the
batf
raided
the
place
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in
the
world
if
they
dont
bother
anyone
but
he
was
a
scary
sort
dont
you
think
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
i
didnt
think
so
reason
number
one
to
doubt
the
legal
statements
made
by
some
of
the
survivors
your
logic
just
amazes
me
i
think
your
grandparents
who
died
in
auschwitz
would
be
turning
over
in
their
graves
if
they
could
hear
how
cavalierly
you
throw
away
peoples
protection
of
law
because
you
think
theyre
scary
and
not
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
what
sort
of
people
do
you
suppose
the
nazis
thought
your
grandparents
were
probably
not
the
sort
theyd
want
their
little
frauleins
dating
note
that
some
of
them
were
made
by
his
guard
wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained
killers
and
next
i
suppose
youll
tell
us
exactly
who
these
welltrained
killers
have
killed
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some
redwhiteand

defending
his
home
against

that

doesnt

because
you
said
so
right
right
anyone
with
his
background
that
will
shoot
and
kill
federal

officials
is
not
some
good

whose

so
someone
with

say
someone
who
didnt
claim
to

in
your

could
shoot

kill

would
be

the

the
organization
which
claims
to
be
championing
conservative
issues
esp
in
the
wake
of
the

defeat
last

some
might
consider
them
just
a
an
organization
to
create
a
network
of
support
among
conservatives
for
some
individuals
in
prep
for
run
youd
be
close
to
the
truth
their
two
leading
spokesmen
are
bill
bennett
former
drug
czar
who
heartily
supported
bushs
semiauto
import
ban
and
wondered
if
it
went
far
enough
who
helped
put
the
big
lie
about
sporting
use
into
the
publics
eye
and
jack
kemp
who
recently
came
out
in
support
of
semiauto

these
are
conservatives
anyway
i
thought
it

it

all
we

are
the
court
documents
in

and
the
mistrial
in
california
you
dont
see
any
evidence
of
the
abuse
therefore
it
must
be
taking
place
as
you
point
out
everwhere
but
here
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
the
atf
is
not
in
charge
of
investigating
child
abuse
no
one
was
ever
held
against
their
wills
and
could
have
left
at
any

the
people
who
were
murdered
in
the
fire
were
there
by
their

exactly
by
their

in
obvious
contradiction
to
the
statements
made
by
the
f
b
i
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
and
just
what
are
those
actions
that
you
are
judging
them
by
their
refusal
to
let
the
government
control
their
lives
their
refusal
to
submit
to
unconstitutional
laws
their
refusal
to
behave
like
cowards
some
of
texas
heros
could
have
taken
the
cowardly
way
out
too
and
surrendered
the
alamo
after
all
all
they
had
to
do
was
come
out
they
stayed
as
you
say
by
their
own
choice
problem
is
not
everyone
chooses
to
act
like
a
groveling
dog
in
the
face
of
insurmountable
odds
but
as
you
point
out
they
certainly
do
have
that
right
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
bull
they
did
in
fact
live
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
the
warrant
was
not
issued
because
they
stockpiled
weapons
it
is
not
against

i

some
such
ive
been
recieving
fan
mail
so
naturally
my
ego
is

inflated
of
late
and
hope
to
make
a
few
points
here
i
have
never
spoken
for
a
ban
against
guns
in
america
what
ive
said
is
that
there
seems
to
be
to
many
of
them
and
especially
to
many
in
wrong
hands
and
our
argument
is
that
you
cannot
remove
them
from
the
people
who
need
restricting
and
not
remove
them
from
the
people
who
dont
a
fairly
simple
problem
given
our
size
and
numbers
do
you
agree
we
all
believe
criminals
particularly
violent
criminals
should
not
have
firearms
the
problem
is
making
a
law
that
does
this
without
trodding
upon
the
rights
of
the
vast
majority
nobody
here
seems
to
be
able
to
do
it
and
i
doubt
anybody
in
norway
can
either
thus
we
are
left
with
a
philosophical
difference
does
the
safety
of
a
few
justify
restricting
the
many
we
say
no
while
others
say
yes
now
if
you
would
like
to
reduce
the
number
how
would
you
do
it
without
affecting
goodresponcible
gun
owners
can
you
provide
a
method
that
cannot
be
abused
i
doubt
it
i
do
believe
in
a
persons
freedom
what
i
dont
believe
is
that
you
can
have
it
all
and
dont
pay
for
it
of
course
this
is
not
in
contention
what
is
in
contention
is
how
much
one
has
to
pay
most
europeans
believe
in
a
society
of
individuals
and
that
you
have
to
give
a
little
to
make
that
society
work
it
is
this
giving
a
little
that
makes
americans
wary
we
have
seen
this
argument
before
you
might
remember
how
a
chamberlain
gave
a
little
to
a
particular
fascistshort
asshole
and
how
such
appeasement
worked
while
it
might
work
in
some
instances
it
doesnt
work
in
others
and
since
we
cannot
predict
the
future
we
must
be
cautious
in
using
actions
that
have
a
history
of
failure
cars
and
guns
should
really
not
be
mixed
i
just
tried
to
make
a
point
like
america
norway
has
some
spaces
you
have
to
cross
to
get
from
a
to
b
so
a
car
is
essential
in
most
parts
guns
on
the
other
hand
are
not
essential
in
norway
so
we
dont
argue
that
if
we
banned
guns
we
have
to
ban
cars
cars
are
not
essential
in
norway
any
more
than
they
are
in
the
usa
im
willing
to
bet
that
you
have
neighbors
that
would
be
willing
to
drive
you
anywhere
you
wanted
to
go
for
a
price
thus
cars
are
not
essential
for
your
transportation
however
the
arguments
presented
show
that
since
cars
are
used
to
kill
far
more
people
than
guns
in
the
usa
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
restrict
cars
than
it
does
guns
how
one
defines
essential
often
depends
upon
what
one
is
willing
to
go
through
for
that
service
when
we
look
at
the
raw
data
such
comparisons
are
not
individually
weighed
everyone
who
believe
that
hitler
and
could
be
avoided
if
there
were
more
guns
in
germany
in
the
please
read
some
history
this
depends
upon
what
the
populace
was
willing
to
do
as
desert
storm
proved
even
an
armed
populace
wont
just
revolt
even
when
given
a
chance
still
would
hitler
have
done
all
that
he
did
with
an
armed
populace
we
have
to
wonder
as
some
of
his
first
acts
were
to
confiscate
firearms
other
points
in
history
show
that
dictators
were
overthrown
by
arms
in
the
hands
of
the
populace
thus
were
left
wondering
if
hitler
would
have
been
overthrown
or
if
king
george
was
just
unlucky
in
keeping
the
usa
as
a
colony
one
can
argue
both
sides
one
also
has
to
live
with
each
action
is
this
discussion
about
banning
weapons
for
all
americans
or
making
it
harder
for
criminals
to
get
one
it
is
about
but
so
far
all
proposals
to
curtail
have
wound
up
enforcing
as
well
i
only
wish
that
or
was
so
logical
change
of
name
that
was
on
my
part
purely
in
jest
i
merely
pointed
out
how
we
were
from
similar
backgrounds
racially
but
of
wholly
different
backgrounds
politically
i
thought
this
would
underscore
my
point
on
how
our
cultures
were
so
different
despite
similar
heritage
did
the
batf
get
the
warrant
for
a
gun
search
only
or
was
there
other
reasons
child
abuse
for
instance
batf
can
only
enforce
guntobacccoalcohol
violations
child
abuse
is
a
matter
for
the
individual
states
and
local
authorities
doesnt
the
people
reading
this

have
access

hierarcy
some
seems

misuninformed
that

how

the

compound
area
for
days
only
to
be
sent
away
two

before
the

whatever
the

comment
has
to
do
with
the
hazards
of
fighting
a
fire
in
the
midst
of
ammo
cooking
off
maybe
the
fire
department
was
loudly
complaining
the
whole
time
about
being
diverted
from
their
other
duties
and
the
fbi
said
fine
go
home
and
well
call
you
if
we
need
you
a

things
could
have
happened
we
dont

i
hope
you
dont
really
think
that
your
average
drug
dealer
actually
purchases
his
guns
from
a
legal
source
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
it
there
were
several
shootings
recently
in
which
the
guns
had
been
purchased
at
the
baltimore
gunsmith
on
broadway
a
favorite
place
to
get
cheap
popular
pieces
by
popular
i
am
referring
to
the
kinds
of
guns
our
local
youth
gangs
like
pistol
grip
shotguns
cheap
magnums
and
i
hate
to
poke
a

re

burns
dividian

no

as
quoted
from
by
natepsygatepsychindianaedu
nathan
engle
what
did
those
people
do
wrong
in
the
first
place
that
is
what
i
cant
figure
out
they
assembled
a
frightening
arsenal
of
weapons
by
circumventing
laws
which
were
intended
to
prevent
such
a
buildup
then
later
they
used
some
of
those
weapons
to
kill
representatives
of
the
federal
government
im
sure
they
were
frightened
when
they
saw
all
those
batf
officers
closing
in
but
in
retrospect
i
cant
see
how
their
subsequent
gunfight
could
be
expected
to
improve
the
situation
what
laws
did
they
circumvent
being
frightening
isnt
a
crime
some
people
are
afraid
of
young
black
males
that
doesnt
make
the
mere
status
of
being
a
young
black
male
a
crime
the
batf
itself
admitted
leading
off
by
throwing
handgrenades
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
properly
identified
themselves
as
law
enforcement
personnel
under
those
circumstances
other
persons
have
been
found
to
be
acting
within
their
legal
rights
to
exercise
self
defense
against
unidentified
armed
intruders
at
this
point
i
place
little
or
no
credibility
on
any
of
the
charges
of
child
abuse
or
molestation
but
i
would
remind
you
that
the
branch
davidians
arent
the
only
ones
burying
their
dead
the
charges
are
irrlevant
anyway
since
the
batf
has
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
in
such
matters
anyway
of
course
that
hasnt
stopped
them
from
making
other
such
spurious
charges
such
as
the
existence
of
mythical
meth
labs
of
course
they
whole
cult
thing
indicates
the
level
of
contempt
that
they
have
for
the
amendment
sure
they
were
crazy
no
dought
about
it
but
what
did
they
do
wrong
they
attempted
to
stage
an
armed
resistance
to
federal
authorities
under
conditions
that
placed
dozens
of
unarmed
and
innocent
people
in
the
line
of
fire
that
armed
resistance
at
least
initially
may
well
have
been
legal

todays

april
reported
that
hb
passed
in
the
texas
house
of
representatives
with
approximately
this
is
from
memory
votes
for
and
votes
against
what
does
this
bill
do
however
in
an
effort
to
go
into
cya
thats
cover
your
ass
mode
they
wrote
the
bill
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
law
subject
to
a
statewide
referendum
in
november
however
the
paper
reported
that
this
is
actually
unconstitutional
under
the
texas
constitution
which
only
allows
referendums
for
constitutional
amendments
not
for
plain
old
laws
if
the
court
does
not
permit
the
referendum
the
bill
will
probably
go
into
effect
with
little
fanfare
all
of
the
above
is
subject
to
the
texas
senates
voting
for
the
bill
as
well
time
to
start
calling
the

average

is
about

and
the

is
rather
but
we
think
this
is
acceptable
because
a

is
not

and
bad

tend

hurt

if
you

you

guns
n

most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
known
criminals
can
not
buy

thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
someone
said
that
if
we
ban
guns
wed
have
to
ban
cars
to
because
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argue
on
this
one
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
dont
flame
the
englishmen
because
of
northern
irland
they
have

control
that
works

what

what
other
sources

do
you
have
which
confirms
their

these
folks
are
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
perhaps
you
can
verify
their
data
with
the
uniform
crime
report
sorry
charles
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
is
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
but
if
you
insist
according
to
the
ucr
firearm
murders
of
youngsters
and
under
increased
percent
between
and
is
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
good
enough
for
you
they
state
that
every
day
american
children
ages
and
under
are
killed
in
gun
accidents
suicides
and
homicides
many
more
are
wounded
or
how
about
the
national
pediatric
trauma
registry
they
say
gunshot
wounds
to
children
ages
and
under
nearly
doubled
in
major
urban
areas
between
and
do
you
also
doubt
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
charles
they
state
that
gunshot
wounds
among
children
in
urban
areas
increased
from
to
charles
i
hope
you
dont
need
to
be
convinced
that
youth
are
increasingly
victims
of
gun
injuries
and
that
they
have
easy
access
to
guns
if
you
dont
realize
this
fact
i
dont
care
if
you
go
by
cdc
or
fbi
data
or
if
you
go
into

and
streets
where
these

are
and
take
a
poll
by
yourself
im
not
going

try

its

that
you
have
ruled
out

in

that
you
are

really
dont

the

ive

for

interpersonal
gun

is
an

in
surgeon
general
c
everett
koop
declared
that
gun
violence
is
as
much
a

cancer
heart
disease

you
greatly
underestimate
the

of
guns
in

lives

in
the
lives
of

in

i
know
a

have

present

is
is
quite
appropriate
to

handle

this

that

bring
guns
to

daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
i
wouldnt
trust
their
statistics
without
independent

the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at

once
in
based
on

kids
who
come

to

have

you
need

make
a

to

and
discover
the
joy
of

in

in
addition
spend
a

talking
to

ask
them
if
they
have
ever
heard

in

whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
been

whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
a

whether
they

whether

i

whether
we

was

a

both

aggravated
assault
involving
knives
and
other
dangerous
weapons
firearms
were
far
more
likely
to
be
used
in

in

times
as
often
over
the
sevenyear

homicides
occurred
in
seattle
per
vs
homicides
in
vancouver
per
after
adjustment
for
differences
in
age
and

among
the
populations
the
relative
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
when
homicides
were
subdivided
by
the
mechanism
of
death
the
rate
of
homicide
by
knives
and
other
weapons
excluding
firearms
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
almost
identical
to
that
in
vancouver
virtually
all
of
the
increased
risk
of
death
in
seattle
was
due
to
a
more
than
fivefold
higher
rate
of
homicide
by
firearms
handguns
accounted
for
roughly
of
homicides
involving
firearms
handguns
were
times
more
likely
to
be
used
in
homicides
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
authors
of
the
report
also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by
police
only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
in
seattle
and
in
vancouver
only
involved
firearms
after
excluding
these
cases
there
was
virtually
no
impact
on
these
earlier
findings
this
is
i
feel
a
very
fair
report
one
might
even
make
the
argument
that
it
is
biased
against
canada
as
a
whole
because
vancouver
reports
annual
rates
of
homicide
two
to
three
times
that
of
ottawa
calgary
and
toronto
while
seattle
reports
annual
homicide
rates
only
half
to
twothirds
that
of
nyc
chicago
los
angeles
and
houston
critics
of
handgun
control
always
argue
that
limited
legal
access
to
handguns
will
have
little
effect
on
the
rates
of
homicide
because
persons
intent
on
killing
others
will
only
try
harder
to
acquire
a
gun
or
will
kill
by
other
means
this
report
shows
differently
if
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
were
influenced
more
by
the
strength
of
intent
than
by
the
availability
of
weapons
we
could
expect
the
rate
of
homicides
by
weapons
other
than
guns
to
be
higher
in
vancouver
than
in
seattle
however
during
the
study
interval
vancouvers
rate
of
homicide
by
weapons
other
than
guns
was
not
significantly
higher
than
that
in
seattle
suggesting
that
few
wouldbe
assailants
switched
to
homicide
by
other
methods
as
well
ready
access
to
handguns
for
selfdefense
by
lawabiding
citizens
was
not
endorsed
in
this
report
although
seattle
did
experience
a
higher
rate
of
firearm
death
for
selfdefense
these
cases
accounted
for
less
than
of
the
homicides
in
both
cities
during
the
course
of
the
study
period
and
as
was
reported
seattle
apparently
didnt
enjoy
relief
from
any
crime
category
over
vancouver
because
citizens
may

arm
themselves

selfdefense

the

fail
to
clearly
demonstrate
that
firearms

handguns
are
far
more
commonly
owned
in

than
in
vancouver
they
use
two
surrogate
approaches
in
pretending
to
study
the
availability
of
firearmshandguns
the
first
is
an
applesandoranges
effort
to
compare
the
number
of
carry
permits
in
seattle
to
the
number
of
registered
handguns
in
vancouver
but
the
number
clearly
understates
the
number
of
handguns
in
seattle
and
counts
primarily
protective
handgun
owners
the
second
however
tells
nothing
about
the
number
of
handguns
in
vancouver
and
counts
nonprotective
handguns
for
the
most
part
where
is
it
difficult
to
obtain
handguns
legally
for
protection
registration
figures
are
meaningless
there
are
registered
handguns
in
new
york
city
new

daily

sept
comparing
the
two
that
method
suggests
about
handguns
per
population
in
new
york
city
compared
to
in
vancouver
meaning
vancouver
has
a
greater
prevalence
of
weapons
than
new
york
city
the
second
method
of
measuring
gun
density
is
cooks
gun
prevalence
index
a
previously
validated
measure
of
intercity
differences
but
the
validation
was
by
cook
of
his
own
theory
ref
normally
second
opinions
are
sought
from
a
different
doctor
more
significantly
the
cook
index
is
based
on
the
average
of
the
percentage
of
firearms
involvement
in
suicide
and
homicide
so
the
authors
are
basically
taking
a
measure
of
misuse
unsurprisingly
gun
misuse
in
homicide
in
seattle
in
vancouver
is
related
to
gun
misuse
in
homicide
plus
suicide
divided
by
two
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
authors
are
not
measuring
the
relative
avail
ability
of
firearms
or
of
handguns
in
seattle
and
vancouver
the
authors
misstate
the
laws
of
both
washington
and
canada
they
neglect
to
mention
the
significant
fact
that
washington
has
a
waiting
period
and
background
check
prior
to
the
purchase
of
a
handgun
and
that
provisions
exist
in
canadian
law
for
owning
and
carrying
handguns
for
personal
protection
the
authors
also
make
it
appear
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
a
handgun
legally
in
canada
than
is
actually
the
case
the
authors
ignore
all
other
factors
which
might
explain
the
differences
in
crime
rate
beyond
some
vague
mention
of
the
penalities
provided
by
law
and
the
roughest
of
estimates
of
clearence
for
one
particular
offense
homicide
involving
a
firearm
there
is
no
measure
of
the
differences
in
the
number
of
law
enforcement
officers
their
aggressiveness
in
making
arrests
for
gun
law
violations
in
the
two
jurisdictions
arrest
rates
for
other
offenses
conviction
rates
actual
sentences
imposed
for
gunrelated
crimes
violent
crimes
without
guns
or
gun
law
violations
or
incarceration
rates
whereas
social
scientists
would
attempt
to
measure
and
hold
for
such
differences
the
authors
of
the
nejm
tale
of
two
cities
fail
even
to
mention
most
factors
related
to
crime
control
the
authors
dismiss
claims
that
handguns
are
an
effective
means
for
protection
unless
the
criminal
is
killed
such
is
not
the
case
criminologists
ref
have
found
that
almost
americans
annually
use
handguns
for
protection
from
criminals
and
that
using
a
gun
for
protection
reduces
the
liklihood
that
a
crime
rape
robbery
assault
will
be
completed
by
the
criminal
and
reduces
the
likelihood
of
injury
to
the
victim
it
is
interesting
nonetheless
that
the
authors
reported
the
same
number
four
of
civilian
justifiable
homicides
without
firearms
in
each
city
but
that
less
restrictive
seattle
accounted
for
of
the
reported
civilian
justifiable
homicides
involving

what

what

the
problem
is
demonstrated
by
the
most
recent
entry
in
a
long
line
of
scientific
research
purporting
to
show
a
causal
link
between
gun
availability
and
homicide
funded
by
the
federal
government
and
published
last
year
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
study
compared
homicide
rates
in
seattle
and
vancouver
and
suggested
that
a
handgun
ban
may
reduce
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
the
nine
medical
doctors
who
published
handgun
regulations
crime
assaults
and
homicide
essentially
reasoned
in
three
steps
despite
many
historical
social
and
demographic
similarities
vancouver
has
a
markedly
lower
homicide
rate
because
its
stricter
gun
regulations
make
guns
less
available
the
second
step
in
their
reasoning
seems
indisputable
the
overall
homicide
rate
in
seattle
for
the
period
was
per
popuation
compared
with
in
vancouver
homicide
is
definitely
more
common
in
seattle
the
question
then
becomes
why
the
authors
present
a
believable
although
not
entirely
accurate
case
to
support
the
notion
as
claimed
in
the
third
step
of
their
reasoning
that
vancouvers
handgun
regulations
are
much
more
stringent
but
their
evidence
on
the
difference
in
gun
availabilty
is
indirect
and
unpersuasive
indeed
they
acknowledge
that
direct
evidence
on
the
point
does
not
exist
they
offer
two
fragments
of
inferential
data
in
support
of
the
claim
that
guns
are
more
available
in
seattle
but
for
all
anybody
knows
as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact
the
opposite
could
be
true
we
are
therefore
being
asked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
study
to
believe
that
a
difference
in
gun
availability
explains
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
when
a
difference
in
gun
availability
has
not
itself
been
established
indeed
the
situation
is
even
more
troublesome
the
first
of
the
two
indirect
bits
of
evidence
is
a
difference
between
the
number
of
concealed
weapons
permits
issued
in
seattle
and
the
number
of
restrictedweapons
permits
issued
in
vancouver
differences
between
the
two
cities
in
the
permit
regulations
render
these
two
numbers
strictly
noncomparable
the
second
bit
of
evidence
is
cooks
gun

index
as

is
directly
related
to
their

but
this
is
exactly
what
the

to

is
seeking

prove
then
to
prove
it
on
the

of
that

ot
constitute
scientific

for
anything
even
if
we
were
to
grant
on
the
basis
of
no
compelling
evidence
that
guns
are
less
common
in
vancouver
we
might
still
question
what
causes
what
the
authors
attribute
seattles
higher
crime
rate
to
a
higher
rate
of
gun
ownership
but
it
might
well
be
argued
that
low
crime
or
homicide
rates
reduce
the
motivation
for
average
citizens
to
obtain
gunsin
other
words
that
crime
rates
explain
the
variation
in
gun
ownership
not
vice
versa
in
fact
it
was
once
commonly
argued
that
great
britains
low
rate
of
violent
crime
was
a
function
of
that
nations
strict
gun
laws
and
the
consequent
low
rate
of
gun
ownershipuntil
british
researcher
colin
greenwood
found
that
great
britain
had
enjoyed
low
rates
of
violent
crime
for
many
decades
before
strict
firearms
controls
were
enacted
to
invoke
an
ancient
methodological
saw
correlation
is
not
cause
nor
do
the
problems
with
this
study
end
with
its
lack
of
direct
data
on
gun
ownership
the
authors
say
seattle
and
vancouver
are
similar
in
many
ways
implying
that
they
differ
mainly
in
gun
availability
gunlaw
stringency
and
crime
rates
this
is
an
evident
attempt
to
establish
the
ceteris
paribus
condition
of
a
sound
scientific
analysisthat
all
else
is
equal
among
things
being
compared
clearly
the
two
cities
are
similar
in
some
ways
but
a
closer
look
reveals
differences
in
ways
that
are
relevant
to
their
respective
crime
or
homicide
rates
the
cities
are
closely
matched
in
what
percentage
of
their
population
is
white
percent
and
percent
but
seattle
is
about
percent
black
while
vancouver
is
less
than
percent
vancouvers
minority
population
is
overwhelmingly
asian
so
although
the
authors
show
that
th
two
cities
are
approximately
comparable
on
a
half
dozen
readily
available
demographic
indicators
they
have
not
shown
that
all
potentially
relevant
sources
of
variation
have
been
ruled
out
in
fact
the
differences
in
racial
compositions
of
the
two
cities
is
particularly
relevant
in
light
of
the
studys
breakdown
of
homicide
rates
according
to
the
race
of
the
victim
for
the
white
majority
the
homicide
rates
are
nearly
per
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
differing
overall
homicide
rates
in
the
two
cities
are
therefore
due
entirely
to
vastly
different
rates
among
racial
minorities
for
blacks
the
observed
difference
in
homicide
rate
is
to
and
for
hispanics
to
methodoligical
complexities
render
the
asian
comparison
problematic
but
it
too
is
higher
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
racial
minorities
are
much
more
likely
to
be
the
victims
of
homicide
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
white
majority
is
equally
likely
to
be
slain
in
either
city
since
the
nearly
initial
difference
in
homicide
reates
between
the
cities
is
due
exclusively
to
or
differences
between
minority
groups
it
is
fair
to
ask
why
postulated
difference
in
gun
availability
or
gunlaw
strigency
would
matter
so
dramatically
to
minorities
but
not
matter
at
all
to
whites
can
differential
gun
availability
explain
why
blacks
and
hispanicsbut
not
whitesare
so
much
more
likely
to
be
killed
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
studies
in
the
united
states
incidentally
do
not
show
large
or
consistent
racial
differences
in
gun
ownership
or
are
other
explanations
more
plausible
could
the
disparity
between
canadian
and
american
rates
of
poverty
among
racial
minorities
have
anything
to
do
with
it
what
are
the
relative
rates
of
drug
or
alcohol
abuse
of
homelessness
among
each
ctys
minority
population
the
city
of
seattle
runs
the
largest
shelter
for
homeless
men
west
of
the
mississippi
unemployment
among
young
centralcity
nonwhite
men
in
the
united
states
usually
exceeds
percent
what
is
the
comparable
canadian
percentage
the
crucial
point
is
that
canada
and
the
united
states
differ
in
many
ways
as
do
cities
and
population
subgroups
with
the
two
countries
absent
more
detailed
analysis
nearly
any
of
these
many
ways
might
explain
part
or
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
in
gross
comparisons
such
as
those
between
seattle
and
vancouver
all
else
is
not
equal
the
authors
of
this
study
acknowledge
that
racial
patterns
in
homicide
result
in
a
complex
picture
they
do
not
acknowledge
that
the
ensuing
complexities
seriously
undercut
the
main
thrust
of
their
argument
they
also
acknowledge
that
socioeconomic
status
is
probably
an
important
confounding
factor
in
our
comparison
remarking
further
that
blacks
in
vancouver
had
a
slightly
higher
mean
income
in
than
the
rest
of
vancouvers
population
given
the
evidence
presented
in
the
article
it
is
possible
that
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
between
seattle
and
vancouver
results
from
greater
proverty
among
seattles
racial
minorities
but
the
authors
pay
no
further
attention
to
this
possibility
since
detailed
information
about
household
incomes
according
to
race
is
not
available
for
vancouver
the
largely
insurmountable
methodological
difficulties
confronted
in
gross
comparative
studies
of
this
sort
can
be
illustrated
with
as
simple
example
if
one
were
to
take
all
us
couties
and
compare
them
in
terms
of
pervalence
of
gun
ownership
and
crime
or
homicide
rates
one
would
find
an
astonishing
pattern
counties
with
more
guns
have
less
crime
would
one
conclude
from
this
evidence
alone
that
guns
actually
reduce
crime
or
would
one
insist
that
other
variables
also
be
taken
into
account
in
this
example
the
hidden
variable
is
city
size
guns
are
more
common
in
small
towns
and
rural
areas
whereas
crime
is
a
bigcity
problem
if
researchers
failed
to
anticipate
this
variable
or
lacked
the
appropriate
data
to
examine
its
possible
consequences
they
coud
be
very
seriously
misled
in
the
study
at
hand
the
authors
matched
two
cities
for
size
but
not
for
minority
poverty
rates
or
other
hidden
variables
and
their
results
are
impossible
to
interpret
in
the
editorial

significance
but
in
attempting

of

is
to
anticipate
plausible
alternative
explanations
for
the

and

absent

the

clinton
gave

they
were

fast
as
they

i
believe
this

continued
even

the
probablility
of
failure
was
high
because
it
came
from

after

in

an
exhaustive
sevenyear
study
has
already
been
done
of
the
respective
crime
rates
of
vancouver
british
columbia
and
seattle
washington
cities
with
roughly
the
same
population
urban
economy
geography
and
crime
but
with
decidedly
different
approaches
to
gun
control
actually
they
do
not
have
roughly
the
same
urban
economy
and
extremely
different
ethnic
composition
over
the
sevenyear
study
homicides
occurred
in
seattle
per
vs
homicides
in
vancouver
per
after
adjustment
for
differences
in
age
and
sex
among
the
populations
the
relative
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
however
if
you
account
for
economic
and
ethnic
differences
the
difference
disappears
completely
seattles
minorities
are
predominatly
poor
while
vancouvers
are
middle
or
upper
class
the
rates
for
whites
in
both
cities
were
found
to
be
identicle
while
the
rate
for
poor
seattle
minorities
was
almost
three
times
as
great
as
for
the
welltodo
minorities
of
vancouver
the
pattern
seems
to
be
one
of
poverty
and
race
relations
not
one
of
gun
control
the
authors
of
the
report
also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by
police
only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
that
is
a
gross
distortion
selfdefense
does
not
mean
killing
the
attacker
there
were
cases
of
civilians
killing
their
attacker
in
selfdefence
but
such
cases
represent
less
that
of
the
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
for
every
case
you
cite
there
were
over
other
cases
of
selfdefence
where
the
crime
was
prevented
but
the
attacker
was
not
killed
by
the
way
is
the
most
conservative
possible
figure
based
on
the
national
crime
surveys
estimate
of
crimes
prevented
by
armed
selfdefence
each
year
most
other
studies
on
the
subject
put
the
figure
at
to
those
figures
would
imply
less
than
of
sucessful
selfdefences
involve
killing
the
attacker
so
more
correctly
there
over
possibly
as
many
as
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefence
only
of
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
the
attacker
this
is
a
significant
factor
in
comparison
to
the
homicides
if
memory
serves
homicides
make
up
approximately
of
the
violent
crimes
the
study
considered
so
the
fair
comparison
would
be
homicides
prevented
and
homicides
clearly
the
study
can
not
be
close
to
accurate
since
it
ignored

the

is
that

banning

will
reduce
the

i
just
heard
some

people
giving
the
usual
arguments
its
everyones
right
to
bear
arms
and
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
of
people
getting
killed
by
guns
is
better
law
enforcement
it
strikes
me
that
this
argument
could
be
logically
extended
as
follows
a
nuclear
weapon
is
an
arm
hence
anyone
has
a
right
to
have
nuclear
weapons
and
if
someone
uses
his
nuclear
weapons
to
blow
up
new
york
la
and
chicago
thats
okay
as
long
as
we
have
a
good
police
force
capable
of
finding
him
and
putting
him
in
jail
which
will
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
others
do
any
antiguncontrol
people
disagree
with
this
and
if
so
why
yes
i
am
progun
and
yes
i
do
disagree
with
this
statement
nuclear
weapons
in
and
of
themselves
are
dangerous
radioactive
decay
of
plutonium
and
uranium
as
well
as
the
tritium
in
the
weapon
tends
to
be
somewhat
dangerous
to
living
things
can
you
say
neutron
flux
plus
these
things
have
no
self
defense
purposes
its
kinda
hard
to
justify
their
use
as
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapons
or
at
worst
for
industrial

obliteration

cities
and

not
to

that
for
it

be

thats
all
very
well

but
i
was
refering

all
homocides
not

ones
involving

what
is
this
fixation
on
death
by
shooting
as
if
it
were
somehow
worse
than
death
by
stabbing
what
relevance
are
all
homicides
in
this
debate
the
issue
is
guns
not
baseball
bats
no
the
issue
is
reducing
crime
not
guns
if
gun
control
doesnt
lower
crime
overall
then
is
doesnt
address
the
issue
even
a
simpleton
knows
that
he
stands
a
better
chance
of
surviving
an
attack
with
a
baseball
bat
does
that
matter
if
assaults
with
a
baseball
bat
become
much
more
common
muggers
using
a
gun
rely
primarily
on
the
threat
of
the
gun
and
rarely
shoot
their
victim
a
mugger
using
a
knife
is
much
more
likely
to
start
by
stabbing
his
victim
in
an
effort
incapacitate
him
so
while
a
knif
may
not
be
as
deadly
as
a
gun
criminals
are
more
likely
to
actually
use
the
knife
as
opposed
to
threatening
the
victim
with
it
it
isnt
at
all
clear
that
replacing
the
criminals
gun
with
a
knife
would
reduce
murders
stabbings
might
just
become
more
common
thats
why
it
is
important
to
look
at
the
overall
not
the
withgun
homicide
rate
it
avoids
the
issue
of
substitution
different
criminal
techinques
of
using
different
weapons
etc
and
measures
what
we
want
to
prevent
murders
as
for
knives
see
my
earlier
post
id
much
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
thanks
face
possibly
however
facing
knifewelding
attackers
isnt
too
common
stabbing
without
warning
and
by
supprise
is
the
usual
tactic
very
few
criminals
shoot
from
cover
it
attracts
to
much
attention
and
they
dont
have
a
chance
to
go
through
your
pockets
overall
id
much
rather
be
threatened
with
a
gun
than
actually
stabbed
with
a
knife
fortunately
the
best
defense
against
a
knife
isnt
another
knife
anyone
trained
in
unarmed
selfdefense
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
disarming
a
knife
assailant
untrained
in
knife
assault
which
probably
means
of
knife
assailants
actually
the
exact
same
statement
is
true
of
guns
training
in
unarmed
selfdefence
will
let
you
disarm
an
untrained
gunman
without
much
problem
you
also
ignore
the
criminals
reaction
the
national
crime
survey
clearly
shows
that
criminals
unarmed
armed
with
a
knife
gun
or
whatever
are
unwilling
to
risk
their
lives
in
a
confrontation
if
faced
with
a
serious
threat
almost
all
prefer
to
leave
and
find
an
easier
target
therefore
using
or
threatening
to
use
as
is
much
more
commonly
the
case
a
weapon
is
the
best
defence
against
an
attacker
regardless
of
how
he
is
armed
knives
however
are
much
less
effective
than
guns
criminals
dont
consider
knifes
as
a
serious
threat
nearly
as
often
as
they

those

most
studies
find
the

to

about
of
those

homicides
so
private
ownership
of
firearms
saves
approximately
lives
each

there
are
roughly
criminal
homicides
and
fatal
accidents
involving

each

for
there
to
be
any

you
would
have
to
show
that
gun

measures
would
disarm
over
of
the

currently
using

that
would
be
very
hard
to
do
according
the
the
federal

only
of

buy
their

over
the
counter
since
gun

laws
by
their
very
nature
only
effect
legal

such
a
law
would
remove
all
the
benefits
of
armed
lawabiding
citizens
while
having
only
a
minimal

on
armed
criminals
who
by

get

that
doesnt
sound

to
me
there
were
over
accidental

homicides
in
america
in
most

since
most
were

i
assume
you
are
not
supporting
reasonable
laws
ie
waiting

background
checks
licenses

since
only
a

would
alter

you

you
are

the

accidental

at

at

those
few
ive

were
the
simple
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
regardless
of
how
easy
it
is
to
make

banning
guns
will
reduce
the
the
number
of
new
guns
and
seriuosly
impede
the
efforts
of
a
killer
intent
on
buying
a
weapon
washington
dc
has
a
total
ban
on
handguns
and
prohibits
assembled
rifles
within
city
limits
its
homicide
rate
is
almost
ten
times
the
national
average
it
is
also
illegal
for
a
dc
resident
to
drive
to
the
virginia
or
maryland
suburbs
and
buy
a
gun
dealers
are
required
by
federal
law
to
check
ids
and
make

the
buyer
isnt
from

the
ban
can
not
be
easily
sidestepped

show
why
the

is
the
silliest
i
have
ever

take
an
analogy
from

major
can

yet
wecomp

would
willingly
pay

why
dont
we
just
all
write
our
own
software
because
it
is
highly
inconvinient
sure
but
it
you
couldnt
buy
one
you
would
write
your
own
in
fact
people
did
write
their
own
years
ago
more
likely
you
would
find
a
friend
who
was
a
particularly
good
programer
and
get
him
give
you
a
copy
of
his

is
a
very
bad
example
for
your

how
many
people
do
you
know
with
illegal
copies
of

processors
if
people
want
something
and
it
isnt
available

legally
they
will
usually
get
it
illegally
same
with
guns
quite
secondly
how
does
one
get
this
gunpowder
for
the

made
gun
the
formula
has
been
around
for

are
you
going

charcoal

alot
cruder
than

it
works
very
well

so
a

only
be

it
makes
alot
more
smoke
of
course
a
smart
black
marketeer

just
make
the

steal

i

thats

if
you
maintain

i
think
they

with

not

both

here
in

i
have
a
picture
of
a
friend
with
a
nice
buck
which
he
shot
with
his
rifle
i
dont
think
many
deer
hunters
would
condone
your
friends
choice
of
rifle
i
must
agree
with
nathan
as
a
deer
hunter
i
find
it
inhumane
to
use
underpowered
weapons
for
deer
hunting
to
kill
cleanly
with
the
little
requires
extremely
good
marksmanship
most
hunting
situations
dont
allow
for
perfect
shots
hunters
should
use
sufficiently
powerful
weapons
to
drop
the
deer
with
a
single
hit
to
the
chest
the
from
the
or
sks
is
adequate
to
this
task
having
similar
ballistics
to
the
familiar
but
the
little
is
very
marginal
in
the
hands
of
the
expert
or
the
lucky
it
will
do
but
hunters
really
should
have
more
respect
for
their
quarry
gary
ill
agree
that
the
popular
gr
loading
for
rem
is
too
small
for
deersized
game
however
if
you
use
a
gr
semispritzer
or
the
sierra
gr
semipointed
bullet
this
would
be
suitable
like
any
round
you
keep
your
shots
within
a
reasonable
range
it
would
still
be
on
the
lower
end
of
what
id
consider
acceptable
performance
especially
those
long
distance
shots
out
west
hunting
monster
mule
deer
the
rem
has
been
declared
legal
for
deer
hunting
in
oklahoma
the
is
excellent
for
varmit
hunting
and
pest
control
the
in
particular
is
well
suited
given
its
heavy
barrel
and
heat
shielded
foregrip
add
a
highpower
scope
and
youre
in
dog
heaven
however
i
dont
think
nathan
janette
was
refering
to
the
specific
chambering
of
the
rifle
in
question
maybe
he
thinks
self
loading
rifles
have
no
place
in
deer
hunting
that
may
or
may
not
be
his
opinion
but
many
sportsmen
do
use
self
loading
rifles
and
shotguns
wrongo
nra
man
i
was
definitely
referring
to
the
round
not
the
autoloading
aspect
of
the
rifle
i
have
no
problem
with
responsible
hunting
that
doesnt
include
machine
guns
from
choppers
but
a
semi
is
fine
my
uncle
has
bagged
several
deer
with
gauge
slugs
i
would
prefer
that
a
hunter
use
as
much
of
the
catch
as
possible
and
i
dont
condone
hunting
for
sport
only
imho
of
course
two
questions
you
asserted
that
both
the
and
are
not
suitable
for
real
hunting
if
you
have
no
problem
with
hunting
or
using
self
loading
rifles
for
hunting
why
did
you
say
this
if
not
for
deer
then
what
about
other
smaller
game
when
did
i
get
the
nickname

if

this
strongly

wanted

the

currently
regulated
only
by

forces
ie
to
own
them
you
have
to
either
make
them
buy
them
or
steal
them
the
only
thing
that
stops
you
is
the
staggering
cost
more
than
most
nations
can
afford
the
fact
that
no
one
who
has
them
wants
to
sell
to
you
and
the
tight
security
maintained
on
existing
stocks
just
ask
saddam
hussein
i
was
under
the
impression
that
to
obtain
fissionable
materials
ie
plutonium
or
reactorweaponsgrade
uranium
one
was
required
to
obtain
a
federal
permit
to
own
such
materials
given
a
source
of
fissionables
you
can
build
a
bomb
in
your
garage
with
parts
from
hardware
stores
and
electronic
junk
supplies
you
might
have
to
engage
in
some
shady
dealings
to
get
the
explosive
charge
but
thats
trivial
compared
to
getting
the
plutonium
the
basic
information
on
the
design
was
declassified
years
ago
and
can
be
dug
out
of
any
technical
library
by
a
physics
grad
student
actually
why
bother
looking
it
up
from
the
material
we
covered
last
term
in
weeks
of
gech
nuclear
chemistry
i
could
derive
what
it
would
take
to
build
a
bomb
and
as
far
as
the
explosive
charge
i
as
a
chemist
could
synthesize
a
variety
of
explosives
from
commonly
available
chemicals
in
the
garage
if
i
felt
like
the
electronics
behind
the
detonator
and
the
shaped
charges
are
a
little
trickier
however
but
not
impossible
using
a
few
tricks
of
the
trade
and
if
i
really
wanted
to
be
nasty
i
could
include
a
core
of
hydrogen
and
deuterium
of
course
the
hardest
part
is
getting
the
fissionable
material
to
start
with
and

it

the

would

is
is

the

the
more

an

the

would
be
no
certainly
a
million
riflemen
as
opposed
to
a
professional
army
of
only
ten
or
twenty
thousand
the
best
a

here
not

for

i
was

was

no
you
merely

devise

the

a

has

actually
why
bother
looking

up
from
the
material
we
covered
last

in

of
gech
nuclear
chemistry
i
could
derive
what
it
would
take
to
build
a

thats
freshmanlevel

big
deal
can
you
make

work
thats
phdlevel

big
difference
and
as
far
as
the
explosive
charge
i
as
a
chemist
could
synthesize
a
variety
of
explosives
from
commonly
available
chemicals
in
the
garage
if
i
felt
like
the
electronics
behind
the
detonator
and
the
shaped
charges
are
a
little
trickier
however
but
not
impossible
using
a

tricks
of
the

and
if
i
really
wanted
to
be
nasty
i
could
include

you
admit

theres
no

that
could

you
physics
aside
could
you
make

if
you
had
the

the

is
yes

do
we
lock
you
up
now
because
of
this
surely
you
can
see
where
the

comes
into

here
of

the
hardest
part
is
getting
the
fissionable
material
to
start
with
and
living
long
enough

plutonium
has
some
nasty

precisely
why
its

to

btw
is
far
better
for

actually
the
real
reason
that
stern
was
getting
a
bigger
rating
share
was
that
he
was
new
in
dc
not
because
of
the
quality
if
you
can
call
it
that
of
his
show
after
the
fine
was
issued
he
started
to
get
better
ratings
because
of
the
curious
individuals
who
wanted
to
see
how
bad
he
actually
was
since
he
came
to
dc
he
has
had
a
greater
turn
over
of
listeners
than
the
grease
has
in
other
words
more
people
get
sick
of
him
sooner
than
they
do
of
the
grease
after
all
saying
vagina
or
penis
on
the
air
is
hilarious
at
first
the
second
time
it
is
still
a
little
funny
but
when
you
do
it
all
the
time
and
at
the
same
time
think
you
are
the
greatest
man
on
the
planet
and
tell
everyone
so
than
you
are
going
to
get
old
really
quick
give
it
up
mark
you
are
wrong
excuse
me
but
if
you
really
new
what
the
show
was
about
youd
know
that
he
doesnt
just
say
vagina
and
penis
and
that
is
how
he
gets
his
ratings
he
also
addresss
real
issues
as
well
as
being
outrageous
i
dont
hear
any
of
these
other
idiots
doing
a
funny
show
and
getting
into
some
serious
topics
at
the
same
time
he
gets
people
to
think
and
entertains
them
at
the
same
time
so
try
listening
to
his
show
a
little
closer
before
you
tell
them
that
they
are
wrong
and
by
the
way
if
he
is
such
a
flash
in
the
pan
why
do
his
ratings
sustain
so
well

whats

what
do
you
think
of

whatever
the
neutrons

has
a
good
chance
of
absorbing
the
neutron
and
becoming
radioactive
itself
mostly
that
means
water

into

heavy
water
but
some
neutrons
would
also
hit
bones
and
the
resulting
harmfull
secondard
radioactives
would
remain
in
the
body
for
decades
i
think
an
unshielded
nuclear
warhead
could
reasonably
be
considered
a
public
health
hazard
as
for
a
shielded
warhead
i
think
a
fair
amount
of
maintaince
is
required
for
it
to
remain
safely
shielded
eg
storage
in
a
dry
temperatureregulated
facility
etc
for
private
ownership
to
be
unregulated
i
think
a
single
individual
must
be
able
not
only
to
keep
the
weapon
but
keep
it
in
a
safe
condition
if
any
random
private
citizen
could
not
properly
keep
maintain
and
store
a
nuclear
weapon
then
some
regulation
is
clearly
appropriate
plus
these
things
have
no
self
defense
purposes
its
kinda
hard
to
justify
their
use
as
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapons
or
at
worst
for
industrial
target
obliteration
translation
cities
and
population
centers
if
the
militia
has
as
its
job
the
overthrow
of
an
illegal
government
they
are
indeed
useful
weapons
to
the
militia
i
disagree
with
this
purpose
the
job
of
the
militia
is
to
defend
themselves
and
their
community
if
you
look
at
the
american
revolution
as
an
example
the
militias
won
by
seperating
themselves
from
and
becoming
independent
of
a
repressive
government
they
didnt
overthrow
it
and
those
communities
canada
and
england
for
example
that
didnt
defend
themselves
were
still
under
that
same
old
regime
if
the
role
of
the
militia
were
offensive
to
go
out
and
destroy
repressive
governments
nuclear
weapons
might
be
appropriate
but
their
jobs
is
defensive
and
nuclear
weapons
arent
suited
for
that
there
is
also
the
question
of
personal
and
collective
arms
the
second
amendment
definately
protects
ownership
of
personal
weapons
since
the
very
nature
of
the
militia
requires
members
to
provide
their
own
arms
but
it
isnt
clear
if
it
covers
other
arms
certainly
not
all
members
would
supply
for
example
a
tank
only
a
few
could
or
if
they
were
to
be
used
effectively
should
however
those
providing
the
heavy
weapons
have
a
disproportionate
control
over
the
militia
and
its
fierpower
the
militias
as
the
framers
envisioned
them
were
extremely
democratic
if
only
of
the
members
supported
the
cause
only
would
respond
to
a
muster
and
the
militias
firepower
would
be
proportionately
reduced
militia
firepower
and
the
popular
will
were
therefore
linked
but
if
a
small
minority
of
the
members
supplied
a
large
fraction
of
the
firepower
in
the
form
of
heavy
weapons
this
would
all
change
the
militias
firepower
would
depend
on
the
will
of
a
small
minority
not
of
the
general
public
worse
that
minority
would
be
quite
different
from
the
general
public
at
the
very
least
they
would
be
much
richer
as
a
result
i
think
the
nature
and
character
of
the
militia
requires
that
each
member
provide
a
roughly
equal
share
of
the
militias
firepower
his
personal
weapons
and
some
equitable
fraction
of
a

heavier
firepower

by
officials
in
central
florida
to
train
and
arm
women
has
led
to
a
dramatic
drop
in
the
level
of
assault

rape
in
that
area
of

this
program
is
a
rare
gem
as
many
law
enforcement
officials
apparently
believe
that
an
unarmed
citizenry
will
be
easier
to
control
and
thus
favor
tighter
restrictions
the

is
an

are
putting
their

on

the

i
havent
ground
through
much
in

way
of

yet
but
a
couple
of
things
jumped
out
at
me
first
only
and
specify
the
type
of
weapon
used
in
self
defense
and
refer
only
to
weapon
the
second
is
that
while
assaults
rose
about
from
to
wgun
defenses
reported
fell
by
almost
unless
theres
an
explanation
for
this
im
tempted
to
mark
it
as
a
reporting
problem
and
as
such
going
ahead
with
any
examination
of
the
numbers
would
be
a
waste

have

i
would
be
surprised
if
there
werent
contrary
studies
i
might
add
that
sloan

kellerman
was
endorsed
by
the
police
departments
of
both
seattle
and
vancouver
and
is
considered
by
most
of
the
references
i
have
at
hand
the
most
exhaustive
study
of
its
kind
even
by
those
who
take
issue
with
some
of
the
essays
conclusions
sks
statistics
speak
largely
for
themselves
without
postulate
and
i
might
add
vitamin
c
has
been
endorsed
by
a
nobel
laureate
as
a
panacea
for
almost
everything
from
the
common
cold
to
cancer
in
order
to
compare
violent
crime
trends
sk
compared
all
violent
crime
categories
from
simple
assault
through
various
mechanisms
of
homicide
wait
a
minute
sk
did
not
compare
trends
if
they
did
they
would
have
seen
that
the
advent
of
canadas
gun
law
had
no
effect
on
homicides
total
or
handgun
without
a
pre
vs
post
comparison
one
cannot
speculate
as
to
the
utility
of
anything
all
they
have
is
a
correlation
and
correlation
does
not
prove
causality
if
your
point
is
that
nonwhites
commit
more
handgun
crimes
than
whites
then
yours
is
the
dubious
assumption
conventional
social
theory
is
that
economic
status
not
color
is
the
primary
motivating
factor
for
crime
especially
violent
crime
whats
your
point
anyway
that
white
people
are
more
responsible
gun
owners
should
we
assume
that
its
a
coincidence
that
there
are
comparitively
fewer
white
people
earning
below
the
poverty
line
and
living
in
tenement
neighborhoods
where
most
violent
crime
occurs
hold
it
again
you
dismiss
a
point
about
demographics
then
you
ask
about
socioeconomic
demographics
very
slick
differences
between
the
two
cities
in
the
permit
regulations
render
these
two
numbers
strictly
noncomparable
on
the
contrary
its
these
differences
that
are
the
very
basis
of
the
study
the
easy
availability
of
legal
handguns
in
seattle
and
the
much
more
difficult
restrictedweapons
permit
required
in
vancouver
once
again
correlation
does
not
prove
causality
looking
at
prevs
post
data
the
canadian
gun
law
had
no
effect
not
so
cook
measures
suicides
and
assaultive
homicides
with
firearms
against
a
surveybased
estimate
of
the
number
of
legal
and
illegal
guns
in
circulation
within
a
city
sir
if
you
were
a
canadian
and
owned
a
gun
before
the
restrictive
gun
laws
were
passed
and
decided
to
hide
it
rather
than
turn
it
in
would
you
answer
truthfully
a
question
about
gun
ownership
from
someone
who
calls
writes
or
asks
you
on
the
street
that
is
one
problem
with
surveys
nobody
will
answer
an
incriminating
question
another
is
that
people
will
often
tell
you
what
they
think
you
want
to
here
again
your
author
misses
the
core
issue
that
vancouver
citizens
are
prohibited
from
purchasing
handguns
on
the
basis
of
selfdefense
they
dont
have
a
choice
in
the
matter
does
that
mean
no
vancouver
citizens
have
handguns
i
think
not
you
are
discounting
guns
purchased
beforehand
and
guns
purchased
for
purposes
other
than
selfdefense
which
can
also
be
used
for
defense
hmmm
sounds
like
your
author
might
like
a
bumper
sticker
that
reads
guns
dont
kill
people
black
people
kill
people
honestly
his
conjectures
backed
up
by
zero
evidence
zero
studies
and
even
less
common
sense
arent
worth
the
considerable
time
it
must
have
taken
you
to
type
in
his
assumptions
look
frighteningly
close
to
those
pseudoscientific
studies
that
the
white
supremist
assholes
love
the
crap
that
takes
published
statistics
twisted
around
in
an
attempt
to
prove
the
inherent
criminal
nature
of
black
people
he
makes
valid
points
about
demographic
differences
you
then
resort
to
the
kind
of
argument
that
the
politically
correct
movement
often
uses
to
stifle
any
debate
nice
real
nice
this
authors
essay
contains
independent
study
upon
which
to
base
his
conclusions
just
some
strained
disjointed
statistical
discourse
attempting
to
blame
seattles
murder
rate
on
blacks
one
doesnt
have
to
produce
his
own
data
in
order
to
point
out
the
flaws
in
the
methodology
and
conclusions
of
anothers

dont
be
silly
of
course
you
can
the
police
have
everything
the
gangs
have
and
then
some
plus
theyve
got
access
to
the
national
guard
via
the
governor
if
things
get
too
rough
thats
tanks
for
those
of
you
whove
never
seen
them
at
play
of
course
theyve
got
rifles
and
helicopters
and
as
far
as
fullyautomatic

you
can
be
a
lot
better
armed
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
how
so
i
think
youre
making
assumptions
here
that
might
not
necessarily
be
true
my
personal
choice
would
be
a
semiauto
but
revolvers
are
just
as
effective
if
not
more
so
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
relevancy
please
you
sound
shocked
but
that
hardly
proves
anything
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
i
dont
know
where
you
are
originally
from
david
but
you
live
in
tennesse
and
i
live
in
chicago
and
see
this
crap
everyday
on
the
news
and
in
the
papers
i
think
the
situation
is
just
a
tad
different
here
than
there
wait
doesnt
chicago
have
serious
gun
control
if
so
why
do
the
police
need
all
that
firepower
in
the
first
place
sarcasm
alert
all
the
patrol
cars
ive
seen
around
here
have

dear
adrian
im
way
behind

on
my

book
again
so
this
reply
to
your
note
criticizing
the
recent
magazine
interview
i
gave
and
generally
attacking
gun
ownership
will
necessarily
consist
mostly
of
assertions
youre
free
to
believe
or
not
i
can
back
with
evidence
and
logic
ive
neither
time
nor
energy
to
present
now
ive
written
fully
on
this
topic
before
and
will
again
in
the
future
when
i
do
ill
make
sure
you
get
copies
there
are
many
arguments
i
might
make
from
the
futility
and
danger
of
delegating
selfdefense
to
the
police
see
don
kates
in
the
jan
wall
street
journal
to
the
real
effect
of
prohibition
shifting
consumers
from
newlyoutlawed
handguns
or
semiautomatic
rifles
to
items
like
sawedoff
shotguns
or
homemade
bombs
but
ill
limit
myself
here
to
commenting
on
the
newspaper
clipping
you
sent
with
your
note
first
the
freedom
to
own
and
carry
the
weapon
of
your
choice
is
a
natural
fundamental
and
inalienable
human
individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to
arguments
grounded
in
social
utility
second
publication
of
some
latterday
scientific
study
doesnt
alter
the
fact
that
the
gun
prohibitionists
i
discussed
in
my
interview
annoying
you
so
much
in
the
process
were
lying
third
the
freedom

neither

fourth
as
often
happens
with
these
things
the
study
doesnt
support
the
gun
prohibitionists
original
numerical
contentions
anyway
but
simply
adds
a
new
layer
of
spurious
claims
to
an
older
body
of
lies
omissions
and
distortions

neither

nor

sixth
the
fact
that
gun
prohibitionists
have
been
caught
lying
on
countless
occasions
carl
bakal
author
of
no
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
even
confessed
to
it
publicly
makes
the
value
of
this
present
study
dubious

say
the
least
seventh
the
freedom

individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to

grounded
in
social
utility
eighth
given
your
own
lifelong
service
as
a
federal
bureaucrat
not
to
mention
the
cynical
sophistication
of
your
fiction
you
should
be
better
aware
than
most
people
how
progress
in
designing
studies
to
prove
whatever
you
want
outstrips
our
ability
to
collect
meaningful
data
a
case
in
point
we
might
agree
on
is
the
fact
that
it
took
another
kind
of
prohibitionist
or
years
to
create
studies
proving
that
pornography
causes
crime
more
naive
and
probably
more
honest
efforts
in
the
and
clearly
indicate
the
contrary
ninth
the

inalienable
human
individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to
arguments
grounded
in
social
utility
tenth
another
reason
to
doubt
all
such
studies
is
that
human
behavior
as
the
austrian
school
of
economics
demonstrates
is
far
too
complex
and
unpredictable
to
be
meaningfully
quantified
the
attempt
to
do
so
and
then
create
public
policy
based
on
the
resulting
pseudoinformation
is
wrecking
our
civilization
eleventh
the
freedom
to

individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to

grounded
in

utility
twelfth
the
study
is
also
worthless
because
it
incorporates
figures
for
suicide
which
is
not
necessarily
a
tragedy
but
basically
another
individual
right
sometimes
with
ancillary
social
benefits
if
anything
perhaps
suicide
intervention
should
be
a
criminal
offense
thirteenth
and
finally
the
national
rifle
association
officials
quoted
in
the
article
whatever
their
shortcomings
and
they
are
many
are
correct
in
this
instance
the
study
is
meaningless
because
the
freedom
to
own
and
carry
the
weapon
of
your
choice
is
a
natural
fundamental
and
inalienable
human
individual
civil
and
constitutional
right
subject
neither
to
the
democratic
process
nor
to
arguments
grounded
in
social
utility
and
because
of
that
adrian
even
if
the
study
were
valid
it
wouldnt
deter
me
from
a
lifelong
personal
objective
of
seeing
that
anyone
can
own
any
weapon
he
or
she
prefers
and
carry
it
however
whenever
and
wherever
he
or
she
desires
without
asking
anybodys
permission
in
this
im
ably
assisted
by
gun
prohibitionists
themselves
whose
yawping
invariably
moves
previously
unarmed
people
to
go
out
and
buy
their
first
gun
while
they
still
can
before
the
gun
control
act
most
of
the
shooting
fraternity
viewed
handguns
incorrectly
as
it
turned
out
as
inaccurate
ineffective
toys
there
probably
werent
six
million
of
them
in
the
whole
country
now
thanks
to
kennedy
metzenbaum
the
bradys
and
their
ilk
americas
greatest
sporting
goods
sales
team
we
probably
manufacture
at
least
that
many
every
year
the
fascinating
datum
is
that
handgun
control
et
al
are
perfectly
aware
of
this
so
i
guess
youll
have
to
ask
them
yourself
what
their
real
motives
are
look
gunmaking
isnt
an
arcane
or
difficult
art
and
by
the
way
its
easier
to
make
a
fully
automatic
weapon
than
a
semiautomatic
the
fact
that
i
can
still
obtain
my
own
weapon
of
preference
the
selfloading
pistol
is
the
only
thing
which
keeps
me
from
pursuing
this
further
even
if
it
were
difficult
there
are
already
a
quarter
billion
firearms
in
america
with
an
estimated
half
life
of
years
possibly
more
for
stainless
steel
guns
are
gonna
be
around
a
long
time
adrian
whether
you
like
it
or
not
as
for
me
to
paraphrase
elmer
keith
regardless
of
what
the
law
provides
or
any
court
decides
im
always
going
to
be
armed
and
i
will
always
work
to
see
that
others
are
as
well
the
bad
news
is
that
there
are
thousands
more
perhaps
even
hundreds
of
thousands
where
i
come
from
we
cant
be
stopped
by
passing
laws
we
can
only
be
forced
to
arm
ourselves
and
others
secretly
and
given
both
the
practical
and
alleged
differences
between
full
automatics
and
semiautomatics
perhaps
more
efficiently
so

get
very
rich
off
of
the
smuggling
of
booze
into
this
country
during
the
years
of

there
was
a
demand
so
an
entire
industry
formed
to
supply
it
if
alcohol
were

banned
today
it
would
be
much
more

the

now
rank
just
a

in

the
amount
of
marijuana
smuggled

has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its

is
very
low
when
compared
to
cocaine

heroin
its
simply
not

the
risk
its
uneconomical

thus
it

for

subject
re
that
silly
outdated
bill
was
re
koresh
and
miranda
i
wrote
nice
strawman
indeed
the
discussion
is
not
about
whether
there
were
tanks
used
in
sixties
riots
instead
it
is
about
whether
those
tanks
fired
their
main
guns
in
one
of
those
riots
you
claim
they
did
that
claim
is
ludicrous
awesley
replied
i
repeated
what
i
had
been
told
under
what
context
i
had
heard
it
supporting
the
claim
that
tanks
were
indeed
used
in
detroit
in
the
issue
has
never
been
whether
tanks
were
used
in
detroit
in
it
has
been
whether
they
fired
their
main
guns
you
did
not
merely
claim
that
tanks
were
usedyou
claimed
that
they
fired
their
main
guns
to
suppress
sniper
fire
and
that
they
were
quite
effective
at
this
you
continue
to
back
away
from
this
claim
and
defend
something
else
that
nobody
is
disputing
awesley
went
on
i
spent
a
few
minutes
in
a
library
today
found
their
computer
was
down
and
they
dont
have
a
card
catalog
anyway
it
took
about
minutes
to
find
this
in
nightmare
in
detroit
a
rebellion
and
its
victims
by
sauter
and
hines
on
page
telling
of
the
death
of
tonia
blanding
age
when
the
tank
was
fired
upon
by
snipers
it
turned
in
the
direction
the
shots
came
from
the
fiftycaliber
machine
gun
mounted
on
the
tank
belched
fire
into
the
buildings
after
a
short
round
into
the
front
of
the
buildings
the
tank
guns
spit
again
tearing
apart
huge
holes
out
of
the
side
of
the
apartment
well
its
not
the
main
gun
well
its
not
the
main
gun
gee
thats
only
the
entire
point
are
you
now
going
to
admit
that
you
were
wrong
i
wrote
will
i
see
any
pictures
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
will
i
see
pictures
of
buildings
damaged
by
the
shells
will
i
read
the
reports
of
the
tank
fire
ill
bet
you
dollar
to
doughnuts
i
wont
it
will
take
more
than
secondhand
accounts
from
a
few
old
national
guard
sergeants
shooting
the
shit
to
convince
me
that
tanks
shelled
american
cities
in
the
sixties
awesley
replied
well
if
you
bothered
to
read
them
it
wouldnt
take
long
at
all
to
find
reports
of
tank
fire
although
not
necessarily
of
the
main
guns
i
will
never
read
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
in
detroit
in
the
riots
there
is
simply
no
way
that
such
an
event
could
have
taken
place
without
it
being
common
knowledge
even
years
later
the
american
military
firing
shells
from
tanks
in
american
cities
on
blacks
would
have
been
big
news
awesley
goes
on
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
and
on
i
dont
expect
to
convince
you
youll
have
to
open
your
mind
and
eyes
and
actually
do
a
little
research
to
be
convinced
one
way
or
the
other
let
me
know
what
you
find
i
already
know
what
you
found
nothing
if
i
claimed
that
the
marines
used
to
launch
rockets
at
buildings
in
trenton
new
jersey
would
you
believe
me
would
you
suspend
judgment
until
you
had
a
chance
to
research
it
or
would
your
bullshit
filters
kick
in
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them

and
as
far
as
fullyautomatic
weapons
you
can
be
a
lot
better
armed
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
define
armed
better
go
shoot
a
revolver
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
does
one
fires
faster
than
the
other
nope
aside
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usually
not
desirable
sure
it
makes
the
other
guys
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
trying
hitting
anything
with
a
thompson
in
hosemode
this
is
why
the
military
is
limiting
its
now
to
burstfire
simple
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troops
like
to
be
able
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wasteful
of
ammo
something
often
in
short
supply
when
the
enemy
is
plentiful
a
revolver
is
equally
capable
as
a
semiauto
in
the
same
caliber
a
revolver
also
has
the
advantage
that
if
it
misfires
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
a
doubleaction
revolver
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcocked
first
but
will
fire
merely
by
pulling
the
trigger
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotate
to
the
next
round
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safety
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fired
with
an
easy
motion
even
one
handed
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the

often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer

magnum
but
anyway
obplea
dont

off

into

there
was

an

it

the

just
a

and
firepower
in
a
similar
vein
the
amount
of
marijuana
smuggled

has
greatly
decreased
this
is
because
its
valueperpound
is
very
low
when
compared

its
simply
not

the

its

now

there
is

producer
showy
raids

and
thus
it

heres
a
question
if
most
marijuana
is
domestic

producing
it
here
is
economical
why
would
we
expect
it
to
be
imported
of
note
though
domestic
reefer
is

very

a

goes
a

you

done

somebody

it

firearms
tend
to
fall
into

dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to

them
in
your

is
that
this
low
dollarpound
area
is
sufficiently
low
as
to
make
gunrunning
unprofitable
on
what
do
you
base
this
and
given
that
smuggling
channels
are
already

and
given
the
economies
of

would
it
really
add
significantly
more
expense
to
start
smuggling
firearms
especially
considering
doing
so
would
be
less
hazardous
in
terms
of
getting
caught

drugs
all
production
would
have
to
be
local

that
was

you

them
out
id
be
willing
to
wager
that
a

handguns
would
be
worth
more
than
a

and
youre
virtually
guaranteed
to
get
it
past
customs
because
theyd
have
to
hand
search
every

of
every
ship
which
came
through
its
not
simply
a
matter
of
how
much
money
are
they
worth
but
how
much
more
money
are
they
worth
than

based

any

seem
very

compared

because
being
nonlethal
they
are

simply

which
has
a

which
seems
to

the

the

that

is
less
concentrated
than
it
used
to
be
some
of
the

propellents
are

the
arguments
i
see
against
these
nonlethal
weapons
compared
to
handguns
are
lack
of
range
lack
of
stopping
power
or
effectiveness
and
limited
ammo
true
how
about
cost
sprays
using
any
of
the
spray
based
eg
mace
pepper
indoors
is
bound
to
affect
anyone
else
in
the
room
like
the
victim
due
to
the
nature
of
the
stuff
using
the
sprays
outdoors
in
any
sort
of
breeze
mitigates
its
effectiveness
from
reading
various
articles
it
appears
that
mace
especially
the
mace
available
to
citizens
is
pretty
ineffective
on
people
under
the
influence
of
drugs
or
alcohol
pepper
spray
appears
to
be
more
effective
but
has
the
inherent
spray
delivery
problem
it
still
does
not
appear
to
be
anything
better
than
a
distraction
that
might
buy
you
time
to
run
like
hell
if
you
can
consider
that
running
like
hell
isnt
always
a
viable
solution
for
example
if
you
are
dressed
in
boots
and
the
assailent
is
dressed
in
sneakers
you
might
have
a
tough
time
outrunning
them
tasars
and
stun
guns
require
contact
with
skin
for
max
effectiveness
a
jacket
like
a
leather
one
will
mitigate
its
effectiveness
the
user
must
be
extremely
close
to
the
assailent
that
puts
them
at
a
considerable
risk
of
injury
the
user
must
keep
the
stun
gun
in
contact
with
the
assailent
for
some
non
negligible
period
of
time
tasar
darts
can
be

the

a

have

have
any

i

contend
that

and
what

what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
david
this
is
the
arms
race
fallacy
that
somehow
bigger
guns
make
an
individual
safer
the
problem
is
that
for
each
corresponding
level
of
offensive
power
the
is
not
an
automatic
level
of
defense
increase
the
problem
is
that
theres
a
sort
of
lethality
threshold
that
once
you
get
past
youre
only
talking
about
a
metter
of
degree
regardless
of
what
cops
are
up
against
theres
really
no
reason
for
the
average
beat
cop
to
have
anything
bigger
than
a
pistol
on
him
as
a
personal
weapon
and
maybe
a
rifle
and
a
shotgun
in
the
cruiser
i
mean
think
about
it
carrying
a
monster
pistol
or
submachinegun
doesnt
make
the
cop
any
less
wounded
if
somebody
shoots
him
a
lot
of
police
departenments
have
switched
to
semiautomatics
as
better
more
reliable
weapons
and
more
stopping
power
but
theres
a
point
of
diminishing
returns
this
is
a
very
very
good
point
who
cares
what
kind
of
gun
youve
got
if
youre
lying
on
the
ground
dead
and
as
far
as
automatics
go
any
gang
member
carrying
around
a
couple
of
automatics
an
incredible
rarity
is
going
to
be
far
more
of
a
menace
to
himself
and
innocent
bystanders
than
anything
he
might
be
tryinh
to
aim
at
one
auto
is
hard
enough
to
control
anybody
who
could
control
two
is
going
to
get
the
police
officer
regardless
of
what
the
police
officer
is
armed
with
more
stuff
deleted
mostly
mine
my
question
is
this
what
would
a
police
officer
gain
from
having
a
submachinegun
or
similar
personal
weapon
that
he
already
doesnt
have
with
a
or
semiautomatic
pistol
i
dont
see
as
how
the
police
should
be
hosing
around
fullauto
fire
nor
has
my
experience
with
police
officers
or
the
stats
regarding
how
many
police
officers
get
killed
by
other
cops
made
me
feel
such
would
be
a
good
idea
precise
fire
is
far
more
preferable
nor
should
they
using
bigger
guns
most
standard
sidearms
have
more
then
sufficient
stopping
power
when
properly
applied
all
more
powerful
weapons
would
do
is
make
the
likelihood
of
death
higher
without
really
giving
police
significantly
more
options
another
very
good
point
that
is
well
taken
it
seems
that
when
lots
of
lead
is
flying
either
the
cops
or
the
gangs
someone
innocent
always
gets
caught
in
the
crossfire

stuff

about
how
revolvers
are
just
as
good
as
semiautos
all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
actually
i
dont
watch
those
shows
and
youre
right
at
least
partially
i
dont
know
much
about
handguns
im
more
familiar
with
rifles
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiautos
for
most
things
but
they
introduce
unneccessary
complications
to
something
as
nervewracking
as
an
abrupt

you

is
negative
ie
a

because
the

are

there
has
been
a
fair
bit
of

about
this
here
recently
because
the
kangaroo

in
the
grounds
of
the

has
now
reached
plague
proportions
despite
the

the

is
still

shooting
so
now
why
should
we
allow

sorry

that
justification

once

animal

this

only
the
fact
that
some

like
to
go

kill
things
some
people
take
satisfaction
imho
legitimate
satisfaction
in
eating
food
that
they
have
harvested
themselves
the
pleasure
derived
from

is
the
same
as
that
you
get
from
eating
fruit

vegetables
grown
in
your

in

meat
is
probably

point
is
correct
if
politicians
dont
see
any
votes
for
themselves
in
opposing
stupid

in

supporting
measures
which
might
be
effective

of
violent
crime
they
wont
do

when

whether
they

check

no

note
that
the

observations
from
a
naive
norwegian
yup
you
said
it
i
admire
such
honesty
guns
are
made
to
kill
people
not
to
shoot
target
or
to
have
something
more
macho
than
stamps
to
collect
fire
an
anschutz
then
come
back
and
talk
to
us
youre
letting
ignorance
and
possibly
fear
cloud
your
thinking
either
that
or
this
is
sour
grapes
because
we
beat
you
in
the
olympic
shooting
events
funny
youd
think
biathalon
would
be
a
natural
sport
for
the
norse
it
is
more
easy
to
killinjure
someone
with
a
gun
than
with
a
knife
or
a
bat
as
in
baseball
precisely
that
makes
them
the
best
method
of
defense
for
the
citizenry
not
everybody
has
the
time
to
train
with
a
gladius
you
know
but
for
some
reason
those
who
prey
on
others
seem
to
have
more
free
time
to
extend
this
a
bit
further
you
need
only
a
certain
level
of
competence
to
beat
another
with
a
range
weapon
getting
in
their
face
with
a
weapon
and
winning
is
much
more
difficult
and
requires
more
training
time
the
average
citizen
just
does
not
have
ive
spent
a
few
years
practicing
with
a
sword
i
can
take
the
common
person
armed
with
one
though
selfdefense
isnt
the
reason
i
own
one
my
kid
sister
would
have
an
even
chance
of
beating
me
gun
vs
gun
with
only
a
month
of
training
that
makes
firearms
much
better
in
our
eyes
its
not
very
wise
to
compare
two
completely
different
countries
like
usa
and
lets
say
island
on
issues
like
crime
and
violence
excellent
point
perhaps
you
arent
so
naive
after
all
yes
the
problem
is
people
committing
crimes
not
the
tools
beeing
used
but
should
be
taken
into
concideration
taken
into
consideration
in
what
respect
though
quite
wrong
lets
make
it
a
blanket
statement
for
weapons
in
general
this
has
been
taken
into
consideration
we
call
use
of
them
aggrivated
assault
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
assault
with
intent
to
kill
attempted
murder
and
a
whole
host
of
others
and
tack
on
extra
prison
time
we
have
a
very
strict
gunlegislation
in
norway
but
until
recently
it
was
possible
for
enyone
over
years
to
buy
a
shotgun
shotguns
are
used
mainly
for
hunting
in
norway
but
because
it
was
so
easy
to
accuire
one
it
was
the
most
used
gun
in
crimes
in
norway
i
suspect
it
was
about
the
only
weapon
available
you
conquered
your
land
among
others
a
full
millenia
before
we
were
thought
of
and
shortly
thereafter
weapons
werent
quite
so
common
i
suspect
that
a
few
world
wars
made
a
difference
too
since
in
times
of
emergency
weapons
tend
to
be
turned
in
or
donated
to
needy
causes
im
curious
though
were
the
weapons
used
in
the
crimes
bought
shortly
before
the
crime
or
were
they
aquired
by
other
means
any
requirements
other
than
just
registering
the
shotgun
and
unbelievable
the
use
of
guns
in
crime
fell
there
are
now
a
new
law
against
wearing
long
knives
in
public
and
why
should
it
be
allowed
come
on
down
to
honest
eriks
used
swords
heres

short

the

supremacy
weapon
of

eleventh
century
only

tradein
easy
financing
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
you
guys
still
slicing
each
other
with
long
knives
or
is
this
really
not
a
problem
what
i
as
an
scandinavian
have
problems
to
understand
is
that
you
americans
have
a
more
liberal
view
on
guns
and
violence
than
on
nudity
and
sex
try
showing
a
bare
breast
on
tv
insted
of
violence
and
murder
im
all
for
that
what
gets
me
is
that
scandanavians
and
yes
im
only
a
couple
generations
off
the
longship
used
to
be
some
of
the
most
feared
warriors
on
the
planet
a
mere
millenia
ago
yet
now
seem
to
spend
their
time
sitting
in
spas
and
doing
a
bit
of
topless
sunbathing
maybe
you
had
a
bit
more
time
and
a
more
homogeneous
culture
to
become
civilized
with
yes
i
know
a
little
american
history
but
is
it
a
civilhuman
right
to
have
an
assault
gun
in
your
home
andor
an
handgun
in
your
car
yes
were
too
damned
violent
partially
i
believe
because
we
are
not
a
homogeneous
culture
and
dont
identify
ourselves
as
americans
first
and
foremost
im
rather
proud
of
my
norwegian
and
danish
heritage
whereas
i
suspect
you
couldnt
care
less
about
that
welsh
blood
in
your
veins
thanks
to
a
raid
in
ireland
back
in
the
time
scale
and
the
homogeneous
culture
are
important
equally
important
is
a
basic
philosophical
difference
in
personal
versus
collective
good
in
america
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
personal
liberties
are
prized
above
all
this
is
sadly
changing
of
late
but
i
trust
you
notice
how
this
call
for
freedom
makes
laws
that
restrict
individuals
for
little
collective
benefit
hateful
to
americans
id
hazard
a
guess
that
were
america
less
interested
in
freedom
and
personal
liberty
and
more
interested
in
collective
good
we
never
would
have
sent
our
armed
forces
anywhere
one
poor
effect
of
this
culture
we
have
is
that
were
looking
out
for
ourselves
and
it
is
quite
easy
to
identify
with
only
a
small
segment
of
the
population
my
grandmother
tells
of
being
discriminated
against
back
in
denmark
because
she
spoke
low
dane
whereas
others
spoke
high
dane
it
was
shortly
after
world
war
ii
as
i
remember
that
low
dane
was
abolished
so
there
was
one
common
dialect
we
cannot
fathom
such
a
minor
thing
being
a
problem
because
we
have
even
more
obvious
means
of
identifying
an
outsider
the
bad
english
is
not
my
fault
its
probably
the
keyboardsoftware
or
the
quality
of
the
subtext
on
tv
take
heart
yours
is
better
than
of
what
gets
posted
by

any
helpful
hints
for
our

why

good
it
isnt
because
every

it
is
because
of
attitude

the

make
themselves
aware

notice
when
strangers
are

groups

the

you

what
about
guns
with
nonlethal
bullets
like
rubber
or
plastic
bullets
would
those
work
very
well
in
stopping
an
attack
doug
holland
any
projectile
traveling
at
or
near
typical
bullet
speeds
is
potentially
lethal
even
blanks
which
have
no
projectile
can
cause
death
if
the
muzzle
is
in
close
proximity
to
the
victim
i
have
heard
of
rubber
or
plastic
bullets
being
used
effectively
during
riot
situations
where
the
intent
is
crowd
control
rather
than
close
range
self
defense
ive
also
seen
reports
of
deaths
caused
by
them
the
british
in
northern
ireland
use
of
a
firearm
for
self
defense
is
appropriate
and
lawful
only
in
the
gravest
of
situations
at
that
point
i
consider
deadly
lethal
force
to
be
a
proper
reaction
and
so
does
the
law
furthermore
use
of
less
effective
but
still
potentially
lethal
force
has
its
own
set
of
problems
it
may
well
take
more
applications
of
the
less
effective
force
to
stop
the
incident
this
places
all
parties
at
some
risk
the
victim
because
the
attack
has
not
stopped
and
the
assailent
since
the
aggregate
damage
done
by
the
multiple
applications
may
well
be
more
deadly

hmm
i

it

at

self

is
a
valid
reason
for
rkba
the

besides
there
are
other

which
can

just
as

thankfully
it
is
true
that
the

go

without

a

howver
there
are
situations
where
firearms
are
the
most
effective
means
of

what
other
means
do
you
propose
as
equally
effective
freedoms
and
rights
are
not
dependent
on
public
opinion
necessity
or
scientific
scrutiny
new
to
this
planet
everything
is
dependent
on
either
public
or
political
opinion
usually
political
to
imagine
that
inalienable
rights
are
somehow
wired
into
the
vast
cold
cosmos
is
purest
egotism
and
a
dangerous
delusion
new
to
this
country
new
to
political
theory
alas
i
was
speaking
of
principle
without
principle
all
attempts
at
republican
forms
of
govt
are
futile
there
are
times
when
public
and
political
opinion
are
contrary
to
principle
which
is
why
we
have
a
constitution
which
enumerates
govt
powers
and
presumes
certain
rights
a
major
reason
for
this
was
to
prevent
a
tyranny
of
the
majority
no
arguments
against
rkba
can
withstand
scientific
scrutiny
they
dont
have
to
like
so
many
other
things
the
issue
is
one
of
perception
rather
than
boring
statistics
every
time
some
young
innocent
is
gunneddown
in
a
drive
by
every
time
some
kid
is
murdered
for
a
jacket
every
time
a
store
clerk
is
executed
for
three
dollars
in
change
every
time
some
moron
kills
his
wife
because
she
took
the
last
beer
from
the
fridge
every
time
someone
hears
a
bang
in
the
night
the
rkba
dies
the
stats
are
not
all
that
clearly
behind
firearms
the
protection
factor
does
not
strongly
outweigh
the
mindless
mayhem
factor
given
society
as
we
now
experience
it
it
seems
safer
to
get
rid
of
as
many
guns
as
possible
that
may
be
an
error
but
enough
active
voters
believe
in
that
course
this
is
exactly
why
law
should
be
based
on
reasoned
thought
not
immediate
perception
of
course
it
doesnt
always
work
that
way
fortunately
while
there
are
no
guarantees
logic
sometimes
does
prevail
and
if
not
there
are
still
means
for
correction
as
far
as
enough
active
voters
are
concerned
that
is
still
an
open
question
until
the

is

how
do
you

observations
from

norwegian
guns
are
made
to
kill
people
not
to

or
to
have
something
more
macho
than

it
is
more
easy

someone
with

than
with

its
not
very
wise
to
compare
two
completely
different
countries
like
usa
and
lets
say
island
on
issues
like
crime
and
violence
yes
the
problem
is
people
committing
crimes
not
the
tools
beeing
used
but
should
be
taken
into
concideration
only
as
far
as
it
affects
the
crime
rate
we
have
a
very
strict
gunlegislation
in
norway
but
until
recently
it
was
possible
for
enyone
over
years
to
buy
a
shotgun
shotguns
are
used
mainly
for
hunting
in
norway
but
because
it
was
so
easy
to
accuire
one
it
was
the
most
used
gun
in
crimes
the
solution
was
to
restrict
the
sale
so
its
now
necessary
to
apply
and
register
your
shotgun
and
unbelievable
the
use
of
guns
in
crime
fell
did
the
rate
of
crime
fall
if
not
the
ban
was
of
no
use
it
is
the
rate
of
violent
crime
that
matters
not
the
tools
used
its
the
crime
stupid
there
are
now
a
new
law
against
wearing
long
knives
in
public
and
why
should
it
be
allowed
apparently
that
became
the
weapon
of
choice
after
the
shotguns
were
banned
after
that
theyll
decide
the
car
of
choice
is
the
saab
and
propose
a

on
that
what
i
as
an

have
problems
to

that
you
americans
have

with

have
been
at

gang
gang
members
were
practicing

were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at

and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are

are

better
than
the

it
seems
most
state
cops
are
i
dont
know
where
you
are
originally
from
david
but
you
live
in
tennesse
and
i
live
in
chicago
and
see
this
crap
everyday
on
the
news
and
in
the
papers
i
think
the
situation
is
just
a
tad
different
here
than
there
however
dont
forget
that
the
police
in
chicago
can
carry
just
about
anything
they
want
except
for
the
glock
which
is
not
approved
for
carry
guess
they
figure
all
cops
are
like
the
police
chief
of
winnetka
who
happened
to
let
off
a
stray
round
of
this
is
the
same
antigun
police
chief
that
wanted
fullauto
uzis
for
his
patrol
cars
perhaps
in
the
judgement
of
the
majority
of
chicagos
finest
a
closeto
reliable
weapon
like
a
revolver
is
preferable
to
a
reliable
automatic
i
note
that
in
germany
where
certainly
the
semiauto
handgun
is
king
some
of
the
more
elite
police
types
want
revolvers
i
dont
think
the
issue
is
cost
because
chicago
police
certainly
make
on
the
order
of
at
least
your
presumption
of
disadvantage
i
think
is
not
borne
out
by
the
experiences
of
new
york
citys
cops
there
the
cops
usually
come
out
on
top
with
their
standard

ive

i
think
most
of
us
would
rather
be
held
up
with
a
knife
than
with
a
gun
but
how
the
hell
are
you
going
to
manage
that
you
still
havent
offered
ive
been
watching
this
knife
verses
gun
bit
for
a
while
now
even
contributed
a
few
comments
but
this
stuff
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
has
got
to
come
from
ignorance
i
used
to
think
pretty
much
the
same
thing
then
i
got
educated
people
do
not
as
a
rule
understand
how
deadly
knives
can
be
or
how
quickly
you
can
be
killed
with
one
most
people
dont
understand
that
it
takes
less
than
an
inch
of
penetration
in
some
areas
to
cause
quick
within
a
minute
or
so
death
the
death
rates
from
handguns
and
knives
are
within
a
few
percentage
points
of
each
other
many
people
not
realizing
how
deadly
knives
are
try
their
luck
and
thus
more
get
injured
by
knives
a
gun
is
deadly
only
in
a
single
direction
and
its
only
advantage
is
that
it
is
a
remote
control
weapon
a
contact
weapon
such
as
a
knife
controls
a
spherical
area
to
feet
in
diameter
most
people
have
never
seen
knife
wounds
aside
from
slicing
a
finger
by
accident
from
feet
or
so
a
knife
is
very
nearly
an
even
match
for
a
holstered
gun
in
experienced
hands
even
if
the
knife
wielder
has
only
moderate
skill
from
inside
feet
or
so
a
knife
is
a
match
for
a
drawn
gun
a
knife
is
utterly
silent
it
never
jams
and
never
runs
out
of
ammunition
it
is
limited
only
by
the
speed
dexterity
skill
and
ability
of
its
wielder
criminals
in
general
are
young
fast
and
strong
its
interesting
to
note
that
the
patterned
slashing
attacks
used
by
many
martial
artists
remarkably
resemble
the
wild
uncontrolled
slashing
attacks
of
novices
ive
talked
to
several
well
trained
martial
artists
they
have
unanimously
agreed
that
if
they
ever
go
up
against
a
knife
they
simply
plan
on
being
cut
hopefully
not
as
bad
as
the
attacker
practicing
with
firearms
requires
facilities
and
equipment
practicing
with
knives
requires
only
a
small
area
and
something
to
simulate
a
knife
say
a
popsicle
stick
or
tooth
brush
criminals
practice
their
knife
attacks
in
prison
if
you
have
not
trained
against
knives
with
a
firearm
and
do
not
realize
these
facts
the
first
inkling
you
will
have
that
something
is
wrong
is
the
knife
ripping
through
your
throat
or
in
the
case
of
an
experienced
attacker
parts
of
your
body
falling
off
onto
the
ground
a
year
old
man
with
arthritis
can
close
that
yard
distance
and
gut
you
in
about
one
and
a
half
seconds
dennis
tueller
with
a
broken
leg
in
a
walking
cast
managed
it
in
two
ive
seen
people
close
that
distance
and
strike
in
second
im
old
over
weight
and
slow
i
can
do
it
in
seconds
ive
seen
morgue
footage
of
people
killed
with
edged
weapons
that
you
would
not
believe
how
about
a
single
stab
wound
to
the
chest
with
a
table
fork
in
this
case
the
attacker
used
the
handle
not
the
pointed
end
add
to
this
the
fact
that
hand
gun
stopping
power
is
largely
a
myth
except
in
the
case
of
a
central
nervous
system
shot
or
a
round
that
destroys
the
skeletal
structure
it
takes
anywhere
from
to
twelve
seconds
for
a
bullet
wound
to
take
effect
this
is
true
of
even
heart
shots
there
is
the
case
of
the
police
woman
in
la
the
first
recorded
survivor
of
a
shot
to
the
heart
that
lady
not
only
killed
her
attacker
but
chased
him
down
to
do
it
all
four
of
her
shots
fired
after
she
had
been
shot
struck
the
perp
atta
girl
the
bullet
entered
her
on
a
downward
angle
went
through
the
apex
of
her
heart
down
through
the
diaphragm
clipped
her
liver
and
destroyed
her
spleen
it
then
exited
her
back
leaving
a
tennis
ball
sized
hole
she
died
about
six
times
on
the
operating
table
but
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
days
and
was
back
on
full
duty
in
eight
months
she
was
off
duty
at
the
time
and
not
wearing
her
vest
she
was
on
her
way
home
so
happened
to
have
her
gun
no
she
doesnt
think
civilians
should
have
the
same
rights
sigh
the
moral
of
the
story
is
that
even
if
you
do
manage
to
shoot
a
knife
attacker
youd
better
be
planning
on
doing
some
dodging
a
good
alternative
is
to
shoot
for
and
break
the
pelvis
people
can
often
walk
a
little
on
broken
legs
but
a
broken
pelvis
will
nearly
always
anchor
them
many
firearms
schools
recommend
pelvis
shots
against
contact
weapons
the
target
is
as
large
as
the
traditional
center
of
mass
and
is
more
reliable
to
stop
somebody
with
a
contact
weapon
assuming
a
caliber
powerful
enough
to
do
the
job
hot
on
up
will
usually
do
this
remember
folks
the
idea
isnt
to
take
em
with
you
but
for
you
to
live
and
them
to
fail
whatever
the
consequences
for
them
this
the
reason
killing
them
isnt
our
goal
or
in
many
cases
even
good
enough
to
keep
us
alive
i
dont
want
to
face
a
violent
attack
of
any
sort
knowing
what
i
now
know
i
cant
rightly
say
id
rather
face
a
knife
than
an
gun
it
would
have
to
depend
on
the
attacker
and
if
i
could
pick
and
choose
i
wouldnt
be
there
this
is
really
the
bottom
line
criminals
do
not
fear
the
law
criminals
do
not
fear
the
weapon
they
fear
the
citizen
behind
the
weapon
that
has
shown
the
resolution
and
determination
to
do
whatever
it
takes

does

does

does

but
it
would
imply
that
the

thats
nice

it
doesnt

there
is

possession

as
john

the

has
already
ruled
in

such
as
us
v
miller
us
and
us
v

ct
that
that
is
exactly
what
the

protects
this
interpretation
can
be
found
as
far
back
as
the
dred
scott
case
in
its
worth
noting
that
us
vs
miller
sustained
millers
conviction
of
possession
of
an
illegal
firearm
noting
that
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
not
a
proper
militia
weapon
therefore
us
vs
miller
supports
limited
government
regulation
of
firearms
actually
the
miller
court
did
nothing
of
the
kind
it
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
because
the
miller
court
didnt
know
if
the
weapon
in
question
was
a
militia
weapon
doesnt
it
bother
anyone
that
a
major
constitutional
issue
was
taken
up
in
a
case
where
there
was
no
defense
miller
had
been
released
by
the
appeals
court
and
disappeared
only
the
govt
was
represented
we
dont
know
what
would
have
happened
with
the
reasonable
all
guns
are
militia
weapons
argument

actually
the

is
a

participle
used
as
an

to

which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the

the

the
verb

it
asserts
that
the

is
essential
for
maintaining
a
milita
a
free

yes
i
agree
the
first
half
of
the
amendment
does
modify
the
noun
militia
but
the
difinition
of
modify
that
applies
to
how
well
regulated
modifies
militia
is
to
qualify
or
limit
the
meaning
of
for
example
wet
modifes
day
in
the
phrase
a
wet
day
the
amendment
is
similiar
to
the
statement
a
wet

being
annoying
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep

wear

shall

so
how
does

pertain
the
right
to
use
boots
similiar
what
does
the
unorganized
militia
have
to
due
with
the
right
to
own
guns
the
sentence
in
the
second
amendment
doesnt
restrict
the
right
or
state
or
imply
possession
of
the

by
anyone
or
anything
other
than

all
it
does
is
make

the
people
as
in
you
and
me
as
in
the
first
fourth
ninth
tenth
as
well
as
the
second

the
existence
of
this
right
is
assumed
it
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
there
is
no
stated
or
implied
condition
relating
the
right
to
bear
arms
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
to
the
security
of
in
other
words
the
entire
sentence
says
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
unconditional
no
not
unconditional
but
shall
not
be

infringed
is
defined
as
to
break

ignore
the

of

an

an

this

boundaries

the

unconditional
implies
no

is
the

the

are

they

congress

it

again
my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes

you
are

hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
youre
getting
warmer
the
little
thing
in
the
trigger
has
to
be
depressed
before
the
trigger
can
move
what
this
means
is
the
damned
thing
wont
go
off
until
the
trigger
is
pulled
this
makes
it
just
about
there
have
been
some
problems
but
were
assuming
the
gun
is
functioning
correctly
as
safe
as
a
revolver
the
gun
when
working
correctly
is
totally
drop
safe
now
in
police
work
this
is
a
consideration
there
is
not
a
single
documented
case
im
aware
of
where
a
police
officer
was
killed
because
he
failed
to
operate
the
safety
on
his
firearm
there
are
quite
a
few
documented
cases
where
criminals
got
hold
of
the
cops
gun
and
couldnt
figure
out
how
to
get
the
safety
off
in
time
to
use
the
gun
thus
the
proprietary
nature
of
the
safety
to
the
criminal
at
least
very
likely
prevented
the
office
from
getting
shot
the
purpose
of
a
safety
is
to
make
the
gun
safe
from
unintentional
fire
this
does
not
mean
it
should
be
so
complicated
as
to
slow
down
intentional
use
thus
the
glock
safety
is
perfectly
adequate
from
a
safety
standpoint
but
not
necessarily
the
most
desirable
from
the
standpoint
of
open
carry
where
it
is
easily
grabbed
by
somebody
else
by
this
criteria
it
does
make
a
lot
of
sense
as
a
concealed
carry
piece
from
the
standpoint
of
police
use
it
is
no
better
or
worse
than
a
revolver
as
far
as
being
proprietary
to
the
officer
in
the
method
of
firing
it
the
ideal
solution
may
someday
be
biometric
sensing
of
the
user
so
that
the
firearm
cant
be
used
by
anybody
but
its
owner
but
for
now
the
wide
variety
of
safety
systems
helps
unless
the
criminal
happens
to
be
familiar
with
that
particular
type
of
firearm

i

a

also
has
the
advantage
that
if

misfires
you
just
pull

sometimes
depends
on
why
it
misfired
a

almost
all

will

i

doing

action
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the

again
to
rotate

the
next
round
assuming
the
cylinder
will
rotate
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty

under

hammer
for
maximum
safety

still
can
be
drawn

fired

even

safeties
its
unnecessarily
redundant
id
rather
have
the
extra
round
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
quite
true
speed
loaders
are
a
little
less
convenient
to
pack
around
than
magazines
though
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
true
but
this
is
a
training
function
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
cocked
and
locked
for
single
actions
or
hammer
down
on
double
actions
are
the
only
carry
modes
that
make
sense
the
series
colts
for
example
are
quite
safe
to
carry
this
way
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
agreed
now
that
ive
shot
off
my
mouth
a
bit
let
me
back
some
of
this
up
it
is
true
that
a
simple
misfire
on
a
revolver
doesnt
cost
you
much
on
the
other
hand
ive
had
all
sorts
of
interesting
things
happen
over
the
years
for
example
ive
had
factory
ammunition
that
has
had
high
primers
a
high
primer
will
tie
your
revolver
up
somewhere
from
seconds
to
minutes
while
you
try
to
pound
the
action
open
to
clear
the
problem
an
auto
jack
the
slide
and
continue
ive
had
bullets
come
out
of
the
case
keeping
the
cylinder
from
turning
see
clearing
paragraph
above
about
the
worst
that
can
happen
with
a
semi
auto
is
a
double
feed
this
can
be
cleared
in
seconds
most
revolvers
are
more
fragile
then
semi
autos
there
are
all
sorts
of
close
tolerance
parts
and
fitting
involved
dropping
the
gun
or
a
blow
to
the
gun
or
all
sorts
of
things
can
take
it
out
of
action
many
of
the
problems
that
can
be
cured
on
the
spot
with
a
quality
semi
auto
take
a
gun
smith
for
a
revolver
in
short
a
revolver
may
be
less
likely
to
malfunction
but
as
a
rule
when
it
does
youre
out
of
the
fight
the
majority
of
malfunctions
that
occur
with
semi
autos
does
not
fall
into
that
category
vincint
makes
many
good
points
in
this
post
but
leaves
off
the
opposing
view
of
most
of
them
a
real
good
starting
place
is
ayoobs
the
semi
auto
pistol
for
police
and
self
defense
in
general
id
agree
the
revolver
is
an
excellent
first
gun
and
self
defense
weapon
for
somebody
that
does
not
have
the
time
and
inclination
that
is
necessary
for
the
training
and
practice
needed
to
use
a
semi
auto
effectively
as
a
self
defense
arm
most
cops
are
notoriously
indifferent
to
firearms
if
the
department
isnt
going
to
train
them
they
arent
going
to
take
the
time
on
their
own
there
is
no
doubt
that
training
is
an
issue
the
amount
of
training
required
for
effective
use
of
a
semi
auto
is
probably
several
times
that
of
a
revolver
many
cops
dont
bother
for
myself
id
hate
to
be
limited
to
one
or
the
other
id
rather
pick
what
fits
better
with
my
personal
inclination
what
im
wearing
that
day
and
so
on
like
the
moderator
on
recguns
says
buy
em
all
that
said
i
have
to
admit
that
often
my
advice
to
people
thinking
of
buying
their
first
defense
arm
is
right
after
taking
a
class
get
a
ruger
or
smith
revolver
sorry
colt
fans
colt
revolvers
are
ok
too
if
this
post
had
gone
the
other
way
id
be
arguing
for

the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
i
suppose
that
depends
on
how
you
define
vast
majority
you
are
correct
about
majority
somewhere
between
out
of
three
and
one
out
of
will
at
some
period
in
their
lives
experience
a
violent
assault
the
risk
is
generally
higher
than
emergency
medical
problems
like
heart
attack
and
stroke
vast
is
probably
too
loose
a
term
with
approximately
americans
using
firearms
each
year
over
a
year
period
we
get
roughly
since
some
may
have
to
do
this
more
than
once
million
americans
with
experience
in
using
firearms
for
self
defense
yields
percent
of
the
population
yes
i
know
that
is
a
real
rough
estimate
were
closer
to
million
now
but
many
of
these
are
minors
and
should
be
included
etc
thus
the
percentage
if
anything
is
low
at
any
rate
most
minority
groups
in
this
range
are
not
usually
referred
to
as
tiny
minorities
so
i
dont
see
how
the
other
part
of
the
group
can
be
referred
to
as
the
vast
majority
a
little
more
work
might
support
a
simple
majority
of
americans
never
use
own
or
display
a
firearm
certainly
when
you
are
talking
about
ownership
you
are
wrong
nearly
half
of
your
fellow
citizens
own
one
or
more
firearms
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
provide
a
list
of
other
means
that
are
as
effective
then
you
might
convince
your
local
police
departments
to
switch
good

my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
ill
point
out
that
the
whole
point
of
the
difficult
amendment
process
was
to
require
a
supermajority
to
change
the
supreme
law
making
it
impossible
for
a
majority
of
the
people
to
simply
change
the
law
on
a
whim
simply
changing
the
meaning
based
on
the
representatives
of
the
people
effectively
destroys
the
amendment
process
the
states
you
know
are
also
entitled
to
a
say
under
that
process
mox
nix
mr
rutledge
you
are
the
only
one
here
claiming
that
the
rkba
is
dependent
on
the
existence
of
a
topflight
wellregulated
militia
why
this
is
a
false
assumption
has
already
been
posted
a
number
of
times
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
ill
note
that
that
right
could
be
considered
protected
under
the
first
amendments
protection
of
peaceful
assembly
unless
you
would
consider
a
militia
inherently
nonpeaceful
then
theyve
stated
the

very

canada
has
been
blaming
the
us
for
their
problems
for
years
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
ten
years
ago
they
crowed
about
how
great
their
system
was
because
theyd
gotten
rid
of
the
guns
and
the
us
would
be
so
much
better
if
theyd
just
get
into
the
divine
light
shining
from
the
north
we
pointed
out
that
it
was
cultural
differences
and
pointed
to
their
precontrol
crime
rates
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
history
of
the
entire
world
contained
smuggling
and
that
whenever
something
was
wanted
it
was
smuggled
in
if
the
problem
were
based
on
us
guns
it
would
have
surfaced
years
before
now
more
canadian
criminals
want
guns
and
they
are
being
provided
canada
has
its
own
version
of
the
drug
problem
yet
drugs
are
prohibited
in
the
us
hell
here
in
britain
the
cops
dont
even
carry
guns
thats
another
funny
thing
you
see
a
us
border
guard
and
hes
got
his
or
on
his

o
spare
ammo
never
know
maybe
some

shopper
might
get
out

hell
as
i
recall
in

court
even
rusty
carried
a

never
know
some

might
go
nuts
saw
a
news
report
out
of
britain
that
armed
crime
is
on
the
rise
and
several
police
agencies
are
considering
have

there
are
a
lot
of
automobile
accidents
but
atleast
there
is
some
regulation
to
try
to
combat
this
when
i
got
my
drivers
license
i
had
to
take
a
drivers
safety
class
tennessee
at
least
does
not
require
any
sort
of
safety
class
to
get
a
drivers
license
all
that
is
required
is
one
twenty
question
quiz
and
to
drive
a
car
around
the
block
without
crashing
i
have
to
be
licensed
to
drive
in
all
probability
no
you
dont
you
are
required
to
be
licensed
to
drive
on
public
roads
a
license
is
not
necessary
on
private
property
my
car
must
be
registered
most
states
do
not
require
the
registration
of
cars
that
are
not
used
on
public
roads
those
that
do
california
i
know
of
do
so
for
tax
purposes
more
than
anything
else
i
must
at
least
where
i
live
have
liability
insurance
on
both
myself
driving
and
my
car
if
someone
else
had
an
accident
with
it
many
states
do
not
currently
require
this
and
most
again
only
make
this
requirement
for
public
roads
a
car
sitting
unused
is
not
required
to
have
insurance
hmm
wouldnt
manditory
saftey
classes
registration
of
both
the
owner
and
gun
and
manditory
liability
insurance
be
nice
for
gun
owners
the
two
are
not
the
same
as
i
pointed
out
above
there
are
significant
difference
between
making
rules
for
use
on
public
property
and
making
rules
for
ownership
the
other
half
of
the
objection
is
trust
similar
things
to
this
have
been
tried
in
many
local
jurisdications
across
the
country
and
have
been
abused
in
far
too
many
cases
safety
classes
which
are
never
sheduled
never
funded
or
only
one
or
two
is
held
a
year
for
a
limited
number
of
participants
registration
lists
in
new
york
chicago
and
california
have
been
used
for
confiscation
many
gun
owners
would
in
theory
support
these
planes
although
the
numbers
overwhelmingly
show
that
competence
is
not
the
problem
that
intentional
misuse
is
theyve
simply
seen
it
abused
and
are
leery
of
the
next
person
who
comes
down
the
pike
with
a
reasonable

hi
in

any
gun
that
enters
a
national
park
must
be
sealed
i
think
its
a
small
metal
tag
thats
placed
over
the
trigger
the
net
result
of
this
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself
from
bears
or
psychos
in
the
national
parks
instead
one
has
to
be
sensitive
to
the
dangers
and
annoyances
of
hiking
in
bear
country
and
take
the
appropriate
precautions
i
think
this
policy
makes
the
users
of
the
national
parks
feel
a
little
closer
to
nature
that
they
are
a
part
of
nature
and
as
such
have
to
deal
with
nature
on
its
own
terms
guy
hello
i
understand
this
philosophy
the
bears
are
a
national
treasure
the
area
is
their
sanctuary
and
people
who
enter
it
do
so
at
their
own
risk
it
is
better
that
that
rare
human
be
killed
by
a
bear
than
that
bears
be
provoked
or
shot
by
unbearsavvy
visitors
the
bears
arent
having
a
population
explosion
humans
are
so
it
is
better
that
a
human
be
killed
than
endanger
the
bears
i
dont
agree
with
this
philosopy
but
i
understand
it
the
psychos
are
a
bit
different
they
are
not
a
national
treasure
but
i
suppose
the
decision
has
been
made
that
to
allow
provision
for
defense
against
them
would
also
allow
provision
for
defense
against
bears
again
i
suppose
it
has
been
decided
that
it
is
better
for
the
rare
human
to
be
killed
by
a
psycho
than
to
take
a
chance
on
threatening
the
bears
personally
i
wouldnt
go
into
an
area
where
i
would
be
managed
so
as
to
reduce
my
safety
but
come
to
think
of
it
i
guess
i
live

the

i
give

for

i
am

in

they
never
asked
whether
i
actually
owned

a

before
issuing
a

is
reasonably
provided
such

are

now
unless

ownership
of

why
would
you
want

or
exercise

i
know
defending

is
a

at

as
far
as
my
and
i
are

also
as

the

why
dont
you

seldom

but
the
european
attitude
towards
alchohol
and
dui
seems
to
work
their
attitude
towards
weapons
isnt
really
a
valid
comparison
because
theyve
historically
done
their
best
to
keep
the
populace

our

was

take

and
then
convinced
the
french
that
it
was
in
their

interests
not
to
complain

first
we
had
to
overcome
the
fact
that
the
brits
were
doing
their
best
to
restrict
us
to
squirrel
guns

such
so
wed
be

guarentees

currently
the

with

and
the

however
havent
we
already

it

that
in
most
states
like
texas
a
citizen
may
own
a
gun
and
carry
while
at
his
home
or
business
but
a
citizen
is
severely
restricted
from
bearing
outside
these
areas
here
in
texas
you
cannot
carry
in
your
car
except
when
traveling
which
is
usually
defined
as
traveling
across
a
county
line
how
did
this
come
about
are
there
any
court

the
legality
of
restricting
the
carrying

outside
the

there
are

not
any
that
would
help
texans
in
many
states
such
laws
have
been
found
to
violate
the
state
constitution
but
the
federal
second
amendment
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states
it
was
written
to
limit
the
federal
government
only
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
written
to
extend
the
restrictions
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
state
level
however
the
exact
wording
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
very
vague
the
supreme
court
has
been
dancing
around
the
issue
without
facing
it
directly
for
over
years
in
practice
the
bill
of
right
indirectly

through
the
fourteenth
applies
to
the
state
governments
only
if
the

very
appropriately
it

i
dont

i
dont

the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from

in

easy
to

are
being
smuggled
cross

so
what
if
they

they
would
come

either
some

no

or
you

we
also

usually
only

a

might

mild

and
create

something
a
majority
of
the
people
would
object

still
be

might
look
at
issues
like

and
vote
for
the
lesser

evils
i
dont

this
is
a
matter
of
paranoia
since
local
governments
in
for
example
new

and
chicago
have
abused
existing
mild
gun
control
laws
to
create
a
virtual
ban
guns
n
criminals
most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
in
which
case
the
united

already
has
adaquate
gun
control
laws
according
to
federal
statistic
only
of
gunwielding
criminals
legally
purchase
their
own
guns
from
licensed
dealers
if
thats
the
point
of
gun
control
to
prevent
criminals
from
legally
purchasing
guns
then
america
doesnt
need
any
additional
laws
to
accomplish
this
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
how
is
this
any
different
from
guns
there
are
legal
purposes
for
owning
and
using
a
gun
they
are
appropriate
tools
for
hunting
target
shooting
and
selfdefence
like
cars
murder
isnt
their
only
or
even
a
common
use
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
i
certainly
couldnt
imagine
the
american
public
accepting
regulation
of
axes
while
the
politics
of
other
nations
may
be
different
in
america
there
is
strong
opposition
to
any
intrusive
law
that
primarily
would

lawabiding

had
not
done
anything

it

it

of

it
doesnt

anything

at
this
point
what
can
these

do
about

social
problems
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from

and
their

what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a

in
usa
there
are
according
to
surveys
guns
in
of
american
homes
in
many
parts
of
the

this
is
closer
to
those
places
where
almost
everyone
owns
a

are
on

safer
than
those
where
guns
are
less

last
word
responsible
gun
owners
are
not
a
problem
but
they
will
be
affected
if
you
want
to
protect
your

this
is
i
think
a
fundamental
difference
between
american
government
and
that
of
other

here
it
is
not

of
the
main
problems
any
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abused
by
the
goverment
either
some
of
you
are
a
little
paranoid
no
offence
mr
parsli
i
have
to
take
exception
at
this
there
are
verifiable
previous
examples
of
levels
of
us
governments
abusing
guncontrol
restrictions
i
dont
think
it
is
paranoid
to
worry
that
what
has
been
abused
in
the
recent
past
might
be
abused
in
thye
future
after
so
many
times
of
getting
burned
any
sane
person
will
stop
putting
his
hand
on
the
stove
or
you
should
get
a
new
goverment
you
do
have
elections
id
love
to
but
as
long
as
the
politicians
grab
power
to
sell
pork
back
to
their
constituents
theres
not
a
lot
i
can
do
its
silly
to
suggest
that
if
theres
anything
we
cant
trust
the
government
to
do
and
therefore
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
do
it
then
we
should
change
governments
down
that
road
lies
total
government
power
ive
never
been
a
fan
of

guns
n
criminals
most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
this
is
very
likely
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
the
north
american
continent
is
not
europe
no
matter
how
many
people
would
like
it
to
be
drugs
are
very
illegal
and
theyre
here
for
years
canada
has
crowed
about
its
gun
control
if
it
is
necessary
to
control
guns
over
the
whole
continent
then
canada
should
have
always
had
comparable
rates
to
the
us
yet
they
still
dont
unless
you
can
tell
me
why
the
canadian
border
is
so
much
more
magical
than
the
mexican
border
which
is
shorter
and
far
more
heavily
patrolled
then
i
really
cant
accept
that
argument
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
no
there
are
approximately
deaths
due
to
guns
in
the
us
twothirds
of
which
are
suicides
unfortunately
i
dont
have
suicide
rates
for
norway
however
this
makes
the
pergun
death
rate
about
half
the
percar
death
rate
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
the
problems
been
humans
since
before
we
had
stone
axes
the
fct
of
the
matter
is
simply
this
if
nobody
ever
assaulted
anybody
whether
there
is
a
weapon
of
any
sort
around
would
be
totally
irrelevent
yet
weapons
are
built
id
suggest
then
that
the
murderous
impulse
in
humanity
predates
weapons
anyway
the
bosnians
et
al
have
been
making
an
excellent
attempt
to
kill
each
other
for
half
a
thousand
years
taking
away
their
guns
even
if
we
could
would
neither
halt
the
killing
nor
reduce
the
brutality
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
in
the
us
approximately
of
murders
are
commited
with
firearms
with
handguns
with
nonhandguns
the
reason
i
say
that
guns
per
se
are
not
the
problem
is
that
our
nongun
rate
exceeds
most
of
europes
countries
entire
violent
crime
rate
i
dont
really
think
weve
got
more
knives
or
fists
in
any
case
i
think
examples
of
gun
control
applied
to
the
us
have
been
abkect
failures
just
like
drug
prohibition
and
other
forms
of
prohibition
until
you
deal
with
why
people
are
doing
what
they
are
doing
you
wont
solve
your
problem
and
if
the
problem
is
violent
crime
you
shouldnt
concentrate
on
the
tools
instead
the
vast
majority
of
guns
is
never
ever
misused
on
the
order
of
over
the
entire
lifetime
of
the
gun
this
says
to
me
that
you
cant
make
the
argument
that
the
gun
itself
causes
the
misuse
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
the
situation
is
not
good
in
that
people
fear
for
their
lives
but
recall
the
scenes
of
the
storeowners
during
the
last
riots
protecting
their
shops
with
guns
would
it
have
been
better
they
too
lost
their
livelihoods
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
the
problem
of
poverty
and
rage
in
los
angeles
no
it
isnt
however
if
that
problem
becomes
a
violent
action
then
yes
it
can
be
appropriate
whether
or
not
some
person
has
been
hurt
by
their
condition
wont
make
me
less
dead
if
they
burn
down
my
house
with
me
in
it
you
have
to
examine
which
problem
youre
referring
to
if
youre
discussing
someone
violently
assaulting
you
then
it
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
response
to
make
them
stop
hopefully
simply
letting
them
know
youre
prepared
to
shoot
them
would
be
enough
as
it
was
with
the
abovementioned
storeowners
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
of
households
have
some
form
of
firearm
usually
a
long
gun
that
accounts
for
a
level
of
access
for
at
least
million
americans
firearm
ownership
is
most
likely
among
educated
welloff
whites
the
group
least
likely
to
be

in

you
may

clearly

protected

the

the

im

the
worst
id

misdemeanor
even
if
the

were
not

clear

i
might
have
to

about

it
would
still
be
safer
to

if

try

avoid

id
be
committing
several
felonies

ruining
my
chances
of
claiming
selfdefence
in

if
it
really
was
selfdefence
the
prosecuter
would
ask
why
did
you
run
away
and
hide
from
the
police
in
other
states
however
this
decision
might
not
be
so
clearcut
if
someone
in
say
washington
dc
were
to
use
a

in
selfdefence
he
would
automatically
be
guilty
of
several
felony
violations
of

but
the
idea
of
tanks
being
used
to
control
civilians
in
anything
that
pretends
to
be
a
free
society
is
outrageous
when
big
government
feels
it
is
necessary
to
use
that
kind
of
force
to
stomp
out
protests
even
violent
of
the
citizens
that
suggests
that
the
government
is
totally
out

since
that
is
effectively
the
government
declaring
war
on
its
own
people
if
the
government
was
living
up
to
its
responsibility
government

the
people
by
the
people
not
the
lords
and
other
elites
who
want
to
keep
their

going
the
citizens
wouldnt
feel
the
need
to
be
resorting
to
acts
that
need
to
be
squashed
with
a
military
boot
people
do
things
like
that
because
they
have
become
convinced
that
it
is
the
only
option
that
remains
other
attempts
to
have
grievances
redressed
have
been
ignored
and
yes
there
is
a
criminal
element
that
will
exploit
this
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
government
has
been
unresponsive
or
such
acts
wouldnt
be
apt
to
happen
still
not
an
excuse
to
open
up
on
civilians
with
tanks
heavy
machine
guns
or
whatever
its
the
old
might
makes
right
philosophy
that
is
the
hallmark
of
a
government
going
rogue
they
dont
like
it
tough
we
will
simply
squash
them
under

actually
addressing

trial
update
day
friday
april
was
the
fourth
day
of
the
trial
synopsis
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
crossexamined
agent
cooper
under
repeated
objections
from
prosecutor
ronald
howen
spence
moved
for
a
mistrial
but
was
denied
the
day
was
marked
by
a
caustic
crossexamination
of
deputy
marshal
larry
cooper
by
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
although
spence
has
not
explicitly
stated
so
one
angle
of
his
stategy
must
involve
destroying
the
credibility
of
agent
cooper
cooper
is
the
governments
only
eyewitness
to
the
death
of
agent
degan
spence
attacked
coopers
credibility
by
pointing
out
discrepancies
between
coopers
statements
last
september
and
those
made
in
court
cooper
conceded
that
you
have
all
these
things
compressed
into
a
few
secondsits
difficult
to
remember
what
went
on
first
cooper
acknowledged
that
he
carried
a
colt
commando
submachine
gun
with
a
silenced
barrel
i
thought
a
colt
commando
was
a
revolver
cooper
continued
by
stating
that
the
federal
agents
had
no
specific
plans
to
use
the
weapon
when
they
started
to
kill
weavers
dog
when
spence
asked
how
seven
cartridges
could
be
fired
by
degans
rifle
when
degan
was
apparently
dead
cooper
could
not
say
for
sure
that
degan
did
not
return
fire
before
going
down
spence
continued
by
asking
with
how
many
agents
and
to
what
extent
had
cooper
discussed
last
augusts
events
cooper
responded
if
youre
implying
that
we
got
our
story
together
youre
wrong
counselor
spence
continued
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
namely
that
a
marshal
had
started
the
shooting
by
killing
the
weavers
dog
cooper
disagreed
assistant
us
attorney
ronald
howen
repeatedly
objected
to
spences
virulent
crossexamination
of
agent
cooper
arguing
that
the
questions
were
repetitive
and
spence
was
wasting
time
howen
also
complained
that
spence
was
improperly
using
a
crossexamination
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
us
district
judge
edward
lodge
sustained
many
of
the
objections
however
both
lawyers
persisted
until
judge
lodge
had
the
jury
leave
the
room
and
proceded
to
admonish
both
attorneys
im
not
going
to
play
games
with
either
counsel
this
has
been
a
personality
problem
from
day
so
start
acting
like
professionals
spence
told
the
judge
that
when
all
the
evidence
is
in
well
see
that
his
agent
larry
cooper
testimony
is
not
credible
that
he
was
panicked
and
cannot
remember
the
sequence
of
events
spence
continued
were
going
to
findthat
there
is
a
very
unlikely
similarity
almost
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
cookie
cutter
between
the
testimony
of
mr
cooper
and
the
other
witnesses
spence
then
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
the
grounds
that
howens
repeated
objections
would
prevent
a
fair
trial
we
cant
have
a
fair
trial
if
the
jury
believes
im
some
sort
of
charlatan
if
the
jury
believes
im
bending
the
rules
or
engaging
in
some
delaying
tactic
or
that
im
violating
court
orders
judge
lodge
called
the
notion
that
his
repeated
sustainings
of
howens
objections
had
somehow
prejudiced
the
jury
was
preposterous
and
denied
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
lodge
did
tell
howen
to
restrict
his
comments
when
objecting
the
trial
resumed
with
the
prosecution
calling
fbi
special
agent
greg
rampton
the
prosecutions
purpose
was
simply
to
introduce
five
weapons
found
in
the
cabin
as
evidence
however
the
defense
seized
on
the
opportunity
to
further
address
coopers
credibility
defense
attorney
ellison
matthews
harris
other
attorney
questioned
rampton
about
the
dog
rampton
stated
that
there
were
no
specific
plans
to
kill
the
weavers
dog
without
being
detected
matthews
then
had
rampton
read
a
septtember
transcript
in
which
rampton
had
said
that
cooper
had
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
silenced
weapon
was
to
kill
the
dog
without
being
detected
if
the
dog
chased
them
rampton
then
acknowledged
that
he
believed
that
cooper
had
said
that
but
he
could
not
remember
when
he
then
stated
that
i
did
not
conduct
the
primary
interview
with
deputy
cooper
but
i
have
had
conversations
with
him
since
the
interview
was
conducted
monday
april
will
begin
the
fifth
day
of
the
trial
scheduled
is

randy
weaver
trial
update
day
here
is
a
copy
of
my
first
update
on
the
randy
weaver
trial
after
a
large
response
about
email
messages
ive
decided
that
there
is
sufficient
interest
here
on
tpg
to
warrant
posting
file
follows
hi
folks
as
perhaps
the
only
boise
resident
on
the
list
i
guess
it
kind
of
falls
on
me
to
keep
people
updated
about
the
randy
weaverkevin
harris
trial
yesterday
marked
the
seating
of
the
jury
apparently
no
other
legal
activities
occurred
the
jury
was
selected
and
things
start
today
more
interesting
is
what
happenned
outside
about
a
dozen
weaver
supporters
showed
up
to
stage
a
protest
outside
the
courthouse
one
woman
carried
a
sign
that
read
who
stands
trial
for
the
murder
of
vicki
and
sons
name
i
forget
weaver
on
the
evening
news
she
said
i
am
here
protesting
because
i
believe
in
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion
i
thought
we
all
did
nice
sound
bite
grin
the
news
reporter
also
interviewed
some
guy
named
tim
who
refused
to
give
his
last
name
not
to
prejudge
the
guy
but
he
looked
like
a
neonazi
he
also
said
he
expected
many
neonazis
to
show
up
throughout
the
trial
tim
had
been
handing
out
leaflets
in
support
of
weaver
and
harris
and
the
news
had
footage
of
a
boise
cop
telling
him
to
move
along
or
hed
arrest
i
dont
know
the
finer
points
of
this
one
perhaps
theres
a
law
against
political
activity
within
x
feet
of
a
courthouse
or
something
what
happenned
to
the
first
amendment
most
ominous
of
all
was
that
the
local
reporter
filmed
an
agent
of
the
gestapoerratf
with
a
minicam
filming
the
protestors
welcome
to
the
world
of
big
brother
anyhow
gerry
spence
came
out
and
asked
the
protestors
to
leave
because
he
didnt
think
it
would
help
weavers
case
any
he
said
he
was
confident
that
once
the
evidence
came
out
that
weaver
would
be
aquitted
more
stuff
as
it
comes
available
drew
subject
brady
bill
loopholes
hi
ive
just
finished
reading
and
have
several
questions
about
the
brady
bills
and
are
these
the
current
versions
of
the
brady
bill
what
is
the
status
of
these
bills
ive
heard
theyre
in
committee
how
close
is
that
to
being
made
law
and
seem
fairly
similar
are
there
any
important
differences
i
missed
seems
to
have
some
serious
loopholes
a
doesnt
specify
an
appeals
process
to
wrongful
denial
during
the
waiting
period
other
than
a
civil
lawsuit
has
an
appeals
process
once
the
required
instant
background
check
system
is
established
but
not
before
b
the
police
are
explicitly
not
liable
for
mistakes
in
denyingapproving
using
existing
records
so
who
would
i
sue
in
a
above
to
have
an
inaccurate
record
corrected
c
includes
an
exceptiontowaitingperiod
clause
for
if
a
person
can
convince
the
local
chief
lawenforcement
officer
cleo
of
an
immediate
threat
to
his
or
her
life
or
life
of
a
household
member
but
doesnt
say
exactly
what
is
considered
a
threat
nor
does
it
place
a
limit
on
how
long
the
cleo
takes
to
issue
an
exception
statement
true
have
i
misunderstood
any
other
holes
with
just
whats
to
stop
a
person
with
a
clean
record
from
buying
guns
grinding
off
the
serial
numbers
and
selling
them
to
crooks
at
minimum
what
additional
laws
are
needed
to
prevent
this
seems
at
min
a
gun
counting
scheme
would
be
needed
eg
john
doe
owns
n
guns
so
if
passes
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
to
see
legislation
for
stricter
hardertoforge
ids
plus
national
gun
registration
justified
by
a
need
to
make
the
brady
bill
work
please
comment
im
mainly
interested
in
specific
problems
with
the
current
legislationi
dont
mean
to
start

this

the

we
need

out
in

also
people
would
have
a
need
to
replace
guns
with
something
else
perhaps
deadly
sprays
that
would
make
mace
and
oc
seem

water
they
would
be
lighter

easier

guns
are
really
old
in
design
and
as
long
as
we
have
tons
of
them
no
one
is
motivated

something
better
im
sure
we
could
come
up
with
some
real
nasty

if
we
tried

would

moving

more
deadly

i
have
never

anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their

out

their

as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
that
is
the
recommended
way
to

aim
alone
is
no
d
goo
for
defense
if
you
cant
get
the

rapidly
very
true
but
the
way
it
was
being
done
was
just
a
little
unusual
it
looked
to
me
like
they
were
practicing
to
shoot
someone
the
point
that
i
forgot
to
bring
up
here
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
being
a
gang
member
or
not
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
in
this
area
or
in
the
state
of
illinois
for
that
matter
this
is
not
to
say
that
people
in
illinois
dont
carry
concealed
weapons
illegaly
but
practicing
like
that
when
there
are
other
people
around
wasnt
too
bright
of
an
idea
there
isnt
necessarily
a
conflict
between
practicing
with
a
concealed
weapon
for
selfdefence
and
practicing
to
shoot
someone
armed
selfdefence
does
occasionally
involve
shooting
an
attacker
frank

cu
boulder
i
agree
if
you
dont
practice
at
all
and
carry
a

for
selfdefense
you
most
likely
would
be
in
big
trouble
if

wait
for

or
should
you
collect
your

if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out

provided
of

you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed

waited
and
it
was
a
first
offense
what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
ghods
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
trouble
youd
get
into
for
taking
off
like
that
leaving
the
scene
of
an
auto
accident
is
bad
enough
killing
someone
leaving
is
times
worse
whos
going
to
seriously
believe
it
was
selfdefense
when
you
took
the
time
to
collect
your
spent
casings
but
officer
i
reload
well
like
someone
said
in
a
reply
to

it
really
all
depends
on
the
area
that
you
live
in
see
david
veals
reply
to
this
i
have
heard
exactly
the
same
thing
that
he
said
in
his
reply
to
fade
away
if
you
think
that
you
havent
been
seen
i
heard
this
from
a
police
officer
for
the
record
though
he
was
talking
about
in
tennessee
not
everywhere
even
if
you
could
get
away
with
it
youre
still
a
fugitive
do
it
nice

keep
your
lawabiding

re
what
to
do
if
you
shoot
somebody
in
article
david
veal
says
in
article
jason
kratz
i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
as
a
data
point
from
tennessee
a
friend
of
mine
and
a
police
officer
essentially
recommends
that
if
you
can
fade
away
even
if
you
were
perfectly
justified
youre
likely
in
for
a
great
deal
of
hassle
a
side
note
carrying
a
gun
concealed
is
a
misdemeanor
this
is
exactly
what
i
have
heard
before
if
you
were
to
fade
away
and
nobody
saw
you
what
kind
of
evidence
would
they
be
able
to
get
to
catch
you
this
is
assuming
that
you
either
collected
your
brass
or
had
a
revolver
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed

waited
and
it
was
a
first

what
would
happen
if
you
took
off
but
someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
its
one
of
those
by
state
things
pretty
much
guess
its
time
to
take
a
trip
to
the
library
and
look
at
the
illinois
statutes
again
just
for
the
record
folks
im
just
asking
this
because
im
curious
im
just
trying

you

i
remeber
being

seeing

that
british
sense

probably
got
a
real
gutbuster
going
when
the
ira
blew
that
kid
up
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
huh
of
course
in
britain
your
government
has
ordered
you
defenseless
so
your
way
of
coping
with
violent
criminals
is
to
laugh
at
victims
pickup
truck
in
front
of
the
car
that
my
friend
and
i
were
in
it
had
a
bumper
sticker
proclaiming
gun
control
is
a
firm
grip
on
a
now
im
sure
that
that
wanker
thought
he
was
pretty
cool
i
dont
know
about
a
my
own
preference
is
for
what
he
didnt
realize
was
that
we
took
a
photo
of
the
back
of
his
truck
and
showed
it
to
our
friends
when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in
the
first
place
ah
canada
where
the
criminals
dont
bother
with
checking
to
see
if
the
victims
are
home
they
just
break
on
in
americas
a
little
different
you
see
criminals
worry
a
bit
more
about
getting
shot
so
they
more
frequently
check
to
see
if
anyones
home
i
knew
somebody
else
who
went
to
one
of
your
gunmart
superstore
places
just
so
he
could
experience
the
sight
of
people
putting
guns
and
ammo
into
shopping
carts
i
didnt
believe
it
myself
until
i
drove
by
one
in
vegas
last
year
ive
heard
gun
world
in
phoenix
arizona
is
fantastic
im
hoping
to
visit
there
myself
soon
now
that
i
live
in
britain
i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
the
bbc
recently
referred
to
the
american
penchant
for
pistols
automatic
weaponsetc
very
appropriately
it
was
called
a
national
eccentricity
ah
britain
again
isnt
that
the
place
where
youre
guilty
until
proven
innocent
tell
me
mr
jajvaxoxfordacuk
didnt
britain
come
begging
to
us
gun
nut
morons
in
the
early
for
guns
to
defend
yourselves
against
hitler
seems
as
though
your
supposedly
enlightened
government
had
disarmed
you
aw
chaps
you
can
jolly
give
up
your
guns
if
that
hitler
man
starts
to
threaten
we
can
always
hit
up
the
yanks
for
a
few
guns
theyve
got
a
bloody
eccentric
habit
about
those
guns
you
know
just
hand
in
your
shotgun
thats
it
thank
you
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
aint
it
just
amazing
how
those
black
markets
work
damn
if
those
drugs
from
south
america
keep
coming
over
our
borders
too
even
though
weve
banned
them
guess
we
might
as
well
legalize
them
makes
you
want
to
send
fifty
bucks
to
the

just
thinking
about

doesnt
it

i
talked

the
federal
dept
of

doj
ottawa
to
try
and
clarify
a
bunch
of
things
regarding
changes
to
canadian
gun
laws
i
am
posting
here
for
informational
purposes
questions
to
email
followup
to
tpg
it
is
still
technically
feasible
but
almost
impossible
to
get
a
concealed
carry
permit
in
canada
this
is
contrary
to
what
i
was
told
by
a
police
officer
it
is
still
legal
to
use
lethal
force
such
as
a
firearm
to
protect
life
also
contrary
to
what
the
officer
told
me
guns
must
be
stored
locked
up
and
unloaded
however
regarding
hicapacity
magazines
it
is
still
not
clear
who
will
be
exempt
or
how
this
will
be
managed
this
is
up
to
each
province
the
general
idea
is
that
exempt
persons
will
receive
a
letterform
authorizing
them
to
possess
the
high
capacity
magazines
apparently
the
authorization
is
to
specify
how
many
of
these
prohibited
weapons
you
will
be
allowed
to
possess
dealers
will
be
allowed
to
order
high
capacity
mags
for
those
allowed
to
possess
them
but
will
not
be
allowed
to
stock
them
high
capacity
magazines
converted
to
comply
with
the
new
limits
will
not
be
considered
prohibited
weapons
amendments
to
the
regulations
specify
some
possible
methods
to
alter
the
magazines
some
manufacturers
beretta
will
be
marketing
reduced
capacity
magazines
god
knows
how
much
theyll
charge
for
these
this
covers
most
of
what
we
discussed
i
have
typed
this
from

do
not
take
it
as

i

they
treat

this

another
indicator
that
the

caste
seems
to
enjoy
more

what

could
it

firearms
tend

many

did
the

because

if

yeah
the

but
you
cant
really
expect
coherent
thought
from

anyway
their
opinions
are
based
more
on
a
desire
to
appear
politically
correct
than
on
facts
which
are
generously
provided
by
the

if
theyd
bother
to
put

and
go

most
of

are

without

none
of
them
bases
hisher
opinions
on

they
would
rather
believe
despite
all
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
disarming
lawabiding
citizens
would
make
the
world
more
civilized
when
all
it
really
does
is
make
us
all
sheep
they
would
rather
wallow
in
their
pitiful
liberal
white
guilt
about
how
society
has
driven
the
criminal
to
rob
rape
and
murder
they
support
spending
millions
of
public
dollars
protecting
the
rights
of
scum
who
have
already
demonstrated
that
they
have
no
regard
for
society
or
its
laws
they
ignore
the
fact
that
areas
with
the
strictest
gun
control
nycdc
have
the
worst
crime
and
areas
with
little
gun
control
vtnhid
have
very
little
crime
in
comparison
but
they
have
to
ignore
this
because
otherwise
they
would
need
to
confront
the
fact
that
lawabiding
citizens
who
own
guns
are
not
the
ones
that
are
causing
most
of
the
trouble
in
society
oh
no
we
certainly
cant
accept
that
but
i
guess
i
have
faith
that
when
crime
starts
making
significant
inroads
into
their
neighborhoods
and
starts
directly
hurting
them
and
their
families
they
will
probably
whistle
a
different
tune
they
just
better
hope
it
isnt
too
late
then
surrender
your
arms
soon
enough
officers
will
be
around
to
collect
them
resistance
is
useless
they
will

yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
excerpted
from
a
letter
i
wrote
a
while
ago
although
less
apparent
to
those
who
have
not
researched
the
facts
personal
protection
is
as
legitimate
a
reason
as
sport
for
the
private
citizen
to
own
a
gun
the
most
recent
research
is
that
of
dr
gary
kleck
of
the
florida
state
university
school
of
he
found
that
handguns
are
more
often
used
by
victims
to
defeat
crime
than
by
criminals
to
commit
it
vs
respectively
in
this
study
these
figures
are
even
more
encouraging
when
you
consider
the
number
of
crimes
that
never
occur
because
of
the
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
hands
of
a
lawabiding
private
citizen
in
a
national
institute
of
justice
study
of
ten
state
prisons
across
the
country
they
found
that
of
the
felons
surveyed
had
aborted
at
least
one
crime
because
they
believed
that
the
intended
victim
was
armed
and
agreed
that
most
criminals
are
more
worried
about
meeting
an
armed
victim
than
they
are
about
running
into
the
one
of
the
most
heinous
of
crimes
is
that
against
the
women
of
this
country
it
has
been
my
recent
observation
that
more
women
are
purchasing
handguns
for
defense
in
response
to
the
present
danger
of
these
assaults
this
should
be
taken
as
encouraging
news
if
the
events
of
orlando
florida
are
any
indicator
in
the
late
the
female
populace
was
plagued
with
a
series
of
brutal
assaults
just
the
publicity
of
the
record
number
of
women
buying
guns
and
obtaining
training
resulted
in
an
decrease
in
rape
for
that
area
the
only
city
of
its
size
in
the
country
to
experience
a
decrease
of
crime
for
that
year
additionally
a
us
justice
department
study
of
attempted
rapes
showed
that
overall
when
rape
is
attempted
the
completion
rate
is
but
when
a
woman
defends
herself
with
a
gun
the
completion
rate
drops

if

fall
for

land

the

theres
one

it
is
supposed
to
be
carried

over
an

cocking
the

turns

so
that
a
loaded
cylinder
is

in

it

other

dont

combined
the

that

do
have
include
the

from

i
can
safely
say
that
if
davis
is
right
in
all
of
his
claims
a
large
negative
number
of
people
are
killed
by
animals
because
we
know
that
the
number
of

by

is
reasonably
large
and
that
the
number
of

due
to
gun

which
is
a
superset
of
the

is
near
zero
i
can

not

killed

went

down

clipped

destroyed

it
then
exited
her

she
died
about
six

on

was
out

in

and
was

she

she

sigh
well
if

think
they
are
so
special
that
only
they
are
worthy
of
selfdefense
perhaps
we
start
putting
the

on

maybe
we
should
start
demanding
that

are
only
police

that
after

lets

if

lets
make
it
regulation
that

chances
are
almost
certain
that
she
wont
be
counted
as
one
of
those
selfdefenders
because
our
local
constabulary
didnt
consider
it
important
that
she
be
allowed
to
arm
herself
even
though
the
shotgun
she
owns
at
home
makes
her
show
up
in
the
gun
owner
column
in
either
case
this
means
the
average
threat
level
in
this
country
is
rather
low
ironic
words
for
somebody
who
lives
in
florida
the
average
threat
level
in
florida
has
been
reduced
by
a
liberal
ccw
policy
its
well
known
that
your
local
thugs
like
to
target
tourists
precisely
because
they
are
less
likely
to
be

than
your
natives
come
on
up
to
boston
or
nyc
or
washington
dc
and
see
how
much
diddlysquat
the
average
threat
level
in
the
country
means
to
a
resident
there
i
think
you
have
weapons
on
the
brain
i
never
said
that
these
alternative
means
of
selfprotection
involved
any
hardware
why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr
jones
house
sometimes
this
works
sometimes
it
just
lands
your
good
neighbors

card

someone
here
once
told
a
story
about

gangs
moving

ive
misplaced
the

but
the
story
started
with
one
resident
calling
the
cops
on
a
gang
member
sure
enough
a
few
nights
later
there
was
a
driveby
performed
at
the
residents
house
except
that
this
time
unlike
in
la
the
entire
street
came
out
and
returned
fire
putting
an
end
to
the
cars
occupants
the
gang
packed
up
and
left
of
course
in
la
or
in
a
place
like
florida
after
the
hurricane
your
first
problem
is
to
find
an
officer
to
step
up
to
and
tell
anything
in
short
the
alternative
to
firepower
is
gangs
or
at
least
a
benificent
manifestation
of
that
social
cooperative
replace
lead
with
flesh
the
flesh
makes
a
better
conversationalist
too
and
you
can
invite
it
over
for
a

party
look
nobody
is
arguing
this
i
have
a
fire
extinguisher
at
home
that
doesnt
mean
i
can
be
careless
about
tossing
my
burnt
matches
on
the
carpet
i
live
carefully
monitor
the
woodstove
get
my
flue
cleaned
twice
a
year
and
test
my
smoke
alarms
annually
but
if
despite
all
this
a
fire
does
start
its
too
late
for
any
of
these
things
except
the
extinguisher
but
legality
and
legitimacy
also
matter
if
a

makes

rule
which
the
government
then

it
is

the

it

it

making
it
the

in

as
you
say
many
of
the

in

middle
of

are
bemused
by
their

i

this

mindless

will
be

to
the

of

if
they
become

and
and

a
different

will
take
hold
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
settle
trivial
complaints
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
hammer

as
well
but
like
you
i
cant
give
any

showing
that
this

btw
which
parts
should
be
secure
criminal
records
ie
convictions
are
typically
considered
public
information
so
should
that
info
be
secure
remember
the
population
includes
parents
checking
prospective
childcare
worker
like
i
said
im
not
sure
of
the
details
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
could
access
medical
information
without
giving
out
a
name
or
any
other
information
medical
info
without
a
namebody
attached
is
completely
useless
for
treatment
the
article
i
mentioned
the
the
earlier
post
described
a
debit
card
type
transaction
in
which
neither
the
store
nor
the
bank
knew
who
was
withdrawing
the
money
thus
making
it
as
secure
as
cash
for
some
purposes
but
far
less
secure
for
others
parents
checking
a
babysitter
shouldnt
need
access
to
the
information
stored
in
the
card
sure
they
do
the
prospective
sitter
may
have
a
nasty
habit
of
molesting
kids
three
or
four
months
into
the
job
the
references
may
not
have
known
him
long
enough
or
may
not
have
picked
up
on
this
yet
remember
criminal
conviction
info
is
public
so
if
youre
going
to
argue
for
an
id
card
other
people
are
going
to
have
a
strong
argument
that
it
disclose
public
info
things
i
think
anything
that
you
choose
to
keep
unknown
should
be
thus
making
it
useless
for
negative
information
could
have
it
so
that
only
doctors
can
access
medical
information
police
criminal
records
etc
etc
yeah
right
how
are
you
going
to
keep
doctors
from
spilling
the
beans
we
already
know
that
you
cant
keep
cops
from
disclosing
info
but
at
least
that
info
is
typically
supposed
to
be
public
anyway
like
i
said
its
best
if
you
read
the
article
for
yourself
the
article
discusses
technology
not

it
also

as

you
can

better
armed
if
you
want
to
hit
what
you
aim
at
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
every
city
and
suburban
police
officer
ive
seen
around
the
twin
cities
in
the
last
two
years
has
carried
a
semiauto
of
some
type
different
brands
though
i
havent
seen
any
glocks
with
regard
to
this
discussion
we
are
getting
dangerously
far
from
the
usual
rantings
of
tpg
and
close
to
the
realm
of
rg
but
id
like
to
put
my
two
cents
worth
in
while
theres
nothing
wrong
with
a
revolver
especially
a
large
frame
sw
in
magnum
my
favorite
there
are
valid
advantages
to
semiautos
i
suggest
reading
massad
ayoobs
i
know
some
people
cant
stand
him
and
think
hes
full
of
bull
but
i
think
that
in
general
his
material
is
very
valid
and
useful
book
the
semi
auto
pistol
in
police
work
or
something
like
that
he
defines
a
number
of
ways
that
semiautos
are
different
and
that
different
is
good
the
main
advantage
is
not
in
increased
firepower
but
in
more
accurate
followup
shots
when
you
go
to
single
action
mode
there
is
also
a
certain
propriatory
nature
of
each
gun
that
takes
some
familiarity
to
learn
this
may
have
diminished
with
time
as
more
criminals
become
familiar
with
different
models
of
semiautos
but
it
was
cited
as
stopping
or
at
least
slowing
down
criminals
who
had
grabbed
a
police
officers
gun
define
armed
better
go
shoot
a
revolver
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
does
one
fires
faster
than
the
other
nope
aside
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usually
not
desirable
sure
it
makes
the
other
guys
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
trying
hitting
anything
with
a
thompson
in
hosemode
this
is
why
the
military
is
limiting
its
now
to
burstfire
simple
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troops
like
to
be
able
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wasteful
of
ammo
something
often
in
short
supply
when
the
enemy
is
plentiful
a
revolver
is
equally
capable
as
a
semiauto
in
the
same
caliber
a
revolver
also
has
the
advantage
that
if
it
misfires
you
just
pull
the
trigger
again
a
doubleaction
revolver
almost
all
of
them
can
be
handcocked
first
but
will
fire
merely
by
pulling
the
trigger
yes
but
this
is
best
done
with
a
two
hand
hold
with
a
single
hand
you
either
pull
the
gun
far
off
target
to
cock
or
must
fire
double
action
the
da
semi
auto
has
the
same
advantages
plus
is
always
sa
after
the
first
shot
a
misfire
in
a
revolver
merely
means
you
must
pull
the
trigger
again
to
rotate
to
the
next
round
im
not
sure
if
this
is
meant
to
be
different
from
your
first
point
in
a
da
semiauto
you
can
pull
the
trigger
again
to
try
dropping
the
hammer
on
the
same
round
an
advantage
you
dont
have
in
a
revolver
where
the
next
trigger
pull
will
always
go
to
the
next
round
discussing
this
point
now
this
is
fine
with
a
dud
but
what
about
a
hangfire
situation
granted
its
very
rare
but
your
round
will
now
go
off
confined
in
the
cylinder
with
no
place
to
go
slingshotting
the
slide
on
a
misfire
takes
very
little
time
a
revolver
can
be
carried
with
the
chamber
empty
and
under
the
hammer
for
maximum
safety
but
still
can
be
drawn
and
fired
with
an
easy
motion
even
one
handed
actually
with
modern
revolver
designs
incorporating
hammer
blocks
this
is
not
necessary
or
usually
recommended
a
revolver
would
have
to
fall
hard
enough
and
at
the
right
angle
to
actually
break
the
hammer
and
driver
the
firing
pin
into
the
round
to
set
it
off
speedloaders
for
a
revolver
allow
reloads
almost
as
fast
as
magazines
on
semiautos
can
be
faster
depending
on
users
the
best
speedloader
users
especially
those
using
the
spring
loaded
speed
loaders
are
very
fast
a
problem
is
that
ejecting
the
spent
cases
is
a
two
handed
job
where
dropping
the
expended
magazine
is
one
handed
this
means
that
while
you
can
be
inserting
a
fresh
magazine
as
soon
as
the
old
one
clears
the
gun
with
a
speed
loader
you
have
to
go
through
more
motions
that
will
always
take
more
time
you
also
dont
have
the
advantage
of
tactical
reloads
replacing
a
partial
magazine
to
bring
you
back
to
full
capacity
the
partial
magazine
can
still
be
used
if
needed
later
a
misfire
in
a
semiauto
will
require
you
to
clear
a
jammed
shell
first
time
spent
which
can
be
fatal
and
a
vital
second
or
so
is
often
lost
as
you
realize
hey
its
jammed
before
starting
to
do
anything
about
clearing
it
yes
the
time
to
recognize
the
problem
is
just
as
important
as
the
time
to
clear
it
really
though
in
either
a
revolver
or
semiauto
the
odds
of
an
actual
misfire
with
factory
ammo
are
awfully
small
you
are
more
likely
to
get
a
jam
in
a
semiauto
but
even
these
are
exceptionally
rare
with
modern
quality
guns
sigs
glocks
etal
most
semiautos
must
have
the
slide
worked
to
chamber
the
first
round
and
cock
the
hammer
some
police
carry
their
semiautos
with
the
chamber
loaded
and
hammer
cocked
but
a
safety
engaged
i
do
not
consider
this
safe
however
you
must
tradeoff
safety
to
get
the
same
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
there
are
some
doubleaction
semiautos
out
there
but
the
complexity
of
operation
of
many
of
them
requires
more
training
all
common
semiautos
can
be
carried
with
a
round
in
their
chamber
without
any
safety
problems
while
i
put
that
out
as
a
statement
that
i
believe
i
should
say
that
this
applies
to
all
of
the
ones
ive
looked
at
for
the
da
semis
its
no
different
from
the
revolver
situation
the
guns
all
have
hammer
or
firing
pin
blocks
they
also
have
a
safety
because
theres
no
real
advantage
carrying
one
of
these
cocked
and
locked
you
have
the
same
safety
and
speed
of
employment
as
a
revolver
plus
the
advantage
of
sa
followup
shots
im
not
familiar
with
sa
semiautos
except
for
the
i
admit
that
i
was
initially
skeptical
about
carrying
this
cocked
and
locked
but
after
examining
the
design
trying
to
defeat
the
safeties
gun
unloaded
of
course
and
shooting
it
a
lot
i
see
no
inherent
safety
problems
with
it
especially
in
a
thumbreak
holster
with
the
strap
under
the
hammer
this
design
also
gets
you
more
speed
for
an
accurate
first
shot
than
a
revolver
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
yeah
the
infamous
glock
i
still
cant
figure
out
how
its
worse
than
a
revolver
for
safety
if
you
dont
pull
the
trigger
it
doesnt
go
off
i
imagine
that
if
all
your
revolver
shooting
was
done
double
action
then
you
could
pull
the
glock
trigger
far
enough
to
fire
before
you
realized
it
in
addition
if
you
had
developed
that
nasty
habit
of
keeping
your
finger
on
the
trigger
when
holstering
your
gun
and
relying
on
your
thumb
on
the
hammer
to
remind
you
to
take
it
off
before
you
blew
off
your
foot
then
youd
have
problems
when
the
hammer
wasnt
there
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
i
think
this
is
even
okay
for
a
riot
as
long
as
its
a
small
one
b
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
i
have
the
poor
mans
beretta
taurus
and
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
the
springfield
oops
vs
arguments
are
relegated
to
rg
you
are
right
though
if
you
dont
hit
what
you
aim
at
then
the
shootergun
combination
has
failed
i
dont
ascribe
failures
in
the
the
fire
real
fast
with
a
wondernine
scenario
you
mention
to
the
gun
this
is
a
shooter
failure
whether
through
lack
of
discipline
or
lack
of
training
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
are
becoming
more
popular
with
crooks
too
though
the
does
still
lead
the
list
and
like
i
said
around
here
semiautos
seem
the
rule
for
the
street
cop
dont
know
about
the
state
patrol
however
they
may
still
carry
the
highway
patrolman
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiautos
for
most
things
but
they
introduce
unneccessary
complications
to
something
as
nervewracking
as
an
abrupt
encounter
with
a
lone
criminal
vincent
please
dont
take
any
of
this
as
a
flame
just
my
whoops
looks

all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
ahem
hrumph
you
have
encurred
the
wrath

you

oooops
dont
have
any
seriously
there
is
no
difference
in
the
safeties
betweena
glock
and
any
da
revolver
intellectually
think
of
the
glock
as
a
very

revolver
ignoring
stove
pipes
misfeeds
and
all

give

has
its

you
just
learn

recently
while
looking

in

store
a
very

stocked

store
i
discovered
a

that
was
being
distributed
by
the
good
folks
who
work
there
traders
btw
is
located
in
san
leandro
ca
the
newspapers
have
now
decided
to
censor
gun
ads
which
is
why
you
no
longer
see
the
ads
that
traders
san
leandro
has
run
for
many
years
these
ads
were
run
for
the
lawabiding
honest
citizens
who
own
firearms
for
sporting
use
or
selfprotection
they
certainly
have
the
right
to
do
so
under
the
second
amendment
right
to
bear
arms
are
you
sure
about
this
im
currently
looking
at
a
copy
of
last
thursdays
sf
chronicle
and
there
is
the
typical
one
column
traders
ad
on
page
in
the
sports
section
not
only
that
but
there
is
a
part
in
the
middle
which
rather
prominently
says
wanted
we
pay
cash
for
assault
rifles
and
pistols
granted
i
havent
seen
todays
paper
yet
but
id
be
surprised
if
there
wasnt
a
traders
ad
in
it
its
probably
worth
it
to
write
to
the
chronicle
and
other
papers
anyway
because
all
their
antigun
editorials
are
disgusting
by
the
way
let
me
put
in
a
plug
for
traders
i
have
shopped
all
over
the
sf
bay
area
and
i
have
never
seen
another
store
with
lower
prices
and
their
selection
is

other

that
it

perhaps
some
insight
into
how
this

works
the
local

had
a
big

to
have
the

release
crime
stats
the

claimed
that
to
do
so
would
violate
federal
education
records
privacy
laws
they
swore
up

down
they
werent
interested
in
student
discipline
records
only
for
stats
so
people
could
make
an
evaluation
of
how
safe
the
campus
was
it
was
barely
a
week
after
crime
stats
were
released
before
the
daily
beacon
had
an
editorial
calling
for
student
disciplinary
stats
to
be
released
because
they
complained
certain
segments
of
the
campus
population
were
treated
administratively
rather
than
turned
over
to
the
police
and
therefore
the
criminal
states
werent
accurate
what
people
say
they

may

a
short
thought
when
you
ask
the
question
of
the
authorities
or
sponsors
of
buyback
programs
whether
they
will
check
for
stolen
weapons
and
they
answer
no
its
total
amnesty
please
note
that
the
given
for
each
firearm
in
the
boston
buy
back
will
not
be
in
cash
but
money
orders
how
much
total
amnesty
can
you
get
if
you
leave
paper
trail
behind
in
the
latest
case
in
denver
they
were
giving
away
tickets
to
a
denver
nuggets
basketball
game
how
traceable
is
a
money
order
i
dont
know
havent
used
one
in
years
money
orders
operate
pretty
much
like
checks
with
both
parties
being
supposed
to
sign
them
i
assume
youd
have
to
show
the
buyback
people
an
id
and
youd
then
have
a
money
order
made
out
to
that
id
as
far
as
traceable
as
a
practical
matter
i
dont
know
it
would
depend
on
whether
they
bother
to
computerize
who
the
recipients
name
is
on
the
money
order
and
bother
keying
that
sort
of
thing
in
id
say
certainly
the
police
and
the
buyback
people
would
keep
a
record
of
who
they
gave
money
orders
out
to
is
that
even
an
issue
if
the
weapons
arent
checked
for
being
stolen
there
might
be
some
questions
asked
i
suppose
if
somebody
brought
in
a
number
of
weapons
each

a

submachinegun
trade
guns

through

after

we

quite
a

about
how

a

is
worth
to
a

so
if
that
is
dwarfed
by
the
price
demanded
by
the
bad
part
of
that
the
relevant
economic
analysis
has
been
made
the
profit
of
gun
crime
is
high
enough
that
the
price
required
to
push
criminals
out
of
the
market
is
high
enough
that
everyone
will
be
motivated
that
analysis
ignored
some
improvements
in
the
criminal
gun
market
that
could
make
them
even
cheaper
theyre
not
efficiently
used
now
but
a
loaner
set

a

the

there

glocks

youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
what
is
the
nature
of
this
disadvantage
if
the
cop
can
shoot
rounds
will
do
the
job
against
a
single
opponent
especially
since
the
cop
has
guaranteed
backup
if
the
gang
member
can
shoot
the
extra
rounds
dont
help
the
only
time
this
difference
can
matter
is
if
neither
can
shoot
and
cops
arent
supposed
to
be
throwing
lead
around
like
that
btw
most
cops
carry
multiple
guns
youre
not
supposed
to
know
about
the
second
third
and
so
on
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
then
the
extra
rounds
wont
make
any
difference
so
why
is
it
an
issue

dillon

says
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
ahem
hrumph
you
have
encurred
the
wrath
of
glock
owners
we
will
beat
you
with

oooops
dont
have
any
seriously
there
is
no
difference
in
the
safeties
betweena
glock
and
any
da
revolver
intellectually
think
of
the
glock
as
a
very
high
cap
revolver
ignoring
stove
pipes
misfeeds
and
all
the
other
bonus
exercises
that
autoloaders
give
you
that
is
every
gun
has
its
safe

and
its

if
you
just
learn

it

all
very

im
going
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friends
basically
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
course
thats
just
my
opinion
jason
subject
re

i
hate
long
postings
but
this
turned
out
to
be
rather
lengthy
overall
crime
rate
it
felljust
like
that
acquiring
weapons
in
norway
you
can
buy
almost
all
kinds
of
weapons
in
norway
but
you
must
have
a
permit
and
a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
if
i
would
like
to
have
a
handgun
i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlicence
from
the
police
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
police
would
check
my
criminal
records
for
any
serious
crimes
andor
records
of
serious
mental
diseases
now
if
a
got
my
licence
i
would
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
gun
club
for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
use
of
guns
in
crimes
in
norway
some
crimes
are
commited
with
guns
that
have
been
in
the
owners
arms
for
a
long
time
but
these
are
rather
the
exeption
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in

belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not

hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
ask
any
historian
or
millitary
with
an
knowledge
of
europe
or
ask
any
german
who
served
in
norway
in
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
the
issue
i
believe
the
issue
is
guns
and
gunlegislation
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do

why
do

disclaimher
im
not
a

anti
gun
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence

because

the

the

my
claim
was
the
chain
was
regarding
the
tanks
last
used
in
detroit
in
the
text
follows
you
did
not
merely
claim
that
tanks
were
usedyou
claimed
that
they
fired
their
main
guns
to
suppress
sniper
fire
and
that
they
were
quite
effective
at
this
indeed
when
coffman
claimed
they
were
only
used
as
apcs
i
did
say
i
had
been
told
they
did
fire
their
main

you
continue
to
back
away
from
this
claim
and
defend
something
else
that
nobody
is
disputing
well
the
poster
who
i
responded
to
did
dispute
the
use
of
tanks
rude
of
you
to
call
gary
coffman
a
nobody
well
its
not
the
main
gun
gee
thats
only
the
entire
point
are
you
now
going
to
admit
that
you
were
wrong
that
was
the
entire
point
to
you
what
exactly
did
i
claim
ive
heard
eyewitness
descriptions
of
tanks
using
their
main
guns
to
respond
to
sniper
fire
quite
effectively
i
wasnt
wrong
ive
heard
those
descriptions
if
youre
paying
attention
ive
mentioned
that
i
saw
the
tanks
with
my
own
eyes
but
the
main
gun
firing
was
an
account
i
heard
that
helps
people
judge
whether
or
not
to
kick
in
the
to
use
your
words
bullshit
filters
stating
that
i
claimed
this
is
a
falsehood
what
was
it
i
claimed
as
fact
heres
the
entire
post
we
havent
used
tanks
against
the
black
ghettos
since
detroit
correction
i
know
they
used
tanks
in
detroit
i
saw
em
it
was
well
covered
in
the
news
at
that
time
gordon
lightfoot
mentions
it
in
his
song
black
day
in
july
since
you
dont
dispute
that
and
claim
that
nobody
else
does
that
means
i
was
right
i
will
never
read
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
in
detroit
in
the
riots
there
is
simply
no
way
that
such
an
event
could
have
taken
place
without
it
being
common
knowledge
even
years
later
the
american
military
firing
shells
from
tanks
in
american
cities
on
blacks
would
have
been
big
news
so
one
would
suppose
some
folks
think
in
happened
in
awesley
goes
on
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel
youre
losing
it
so
you
have
to
stretch
what
i
said
and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
glad
to
know
youre
such
an
expert
nice
to
hear
some
an
authority
i
especially
appreciate
your
basis
of
knowledge
if
it
had
happened
you
would
have
know
it
since
you
are
such
an
authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
another
part
of
my
memories
was
that
while
most
damaged
building
were
burnt
some
were
in
rubble
based
on
what
i
remember
i
was
and
am
inclined
to
believe
an
old
sarge
or
two
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing

there
is

that
isnt

great
of

now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safety
is
supposed
to
do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
what
i
safety
is
supposed
to
do
its
basic
purpose
not
to
let
the
gun
fire
until
youre
ready
christ
ive
known
that
since
i
had
my
first
crosman
air
gun
you
dont
know
me
so
dont
make
assumptions
about
what
i
know
and
dont
know
i
do
know
that
the
glock
has
multiple
safties
from
reports
looking
at
them
at
a
gun
shop
and
friends
who
own
one
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the
gun
from
going
off
unless
thats
what
the
user
wants
with
glocks
one
says
i
want
the
gun
to
go
off
by
pulling
the
trigger
if
the
safeties
it
has
make
that
work
it
has
a
real
safety
no
matter
what
kratz
thinks
andy
from
the
things
i
have
readheard
glocks
are
always
knocked
because
of
the
trigger
safety
they
are
supposedly
harder
to
learn
to
use
properly
every
article
that
i
have
read
cant
be
wrong
about
the
damn
thing
and
dont
ask
me
to
quote
my
sources
because
i
dont
keep
a

magazines
andor

articles
laying

boy
you
cant

without

getting

no

why
there
are

everyone
takes

just
a

by

im

as

all
very

im
going
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friends
basically
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
course
thats
just
my
opinion
jason
at
the
risk
of
starting
the
my
gun
is
better
than
yours
flame
war
i
must
disagree
there
is
no
secret
in
handling
a
glock
in
fact
it
is
often
chosen
besides
its
other
merits
because
it
shoots
like
a
revolver
does
basically
it
can
limit
the
training
time
read
budget
due
to
the
fact
there
are
no
external
safties
other
than
the
trigger
hence
less
training
time
required
smith
wesson
among
other
types
are
chosen
due
to
the
fact
taht
they
do
have
the
external
safties
hammer
dropas
well
as
mag
drop
which
if
properly
used
have
saved
many
lives
when
mr
bad
snatched
the
gun
from
the
officer
and
tried
to
shoot
said
officer
the
gun
was
on
safe
and
would
not
fire
this
point
had
been
made
in
many
articles
in
various
gun
magazines
if
fact
one
author
cant
remember
who
staged
a
little
test
where
he
had
a
revolver
and
a
sw
on
safe
laying
on
a
table
and
asked
people
with
little
firearms
experience
to
on
his
signal
grab
the
gun
and
shoot
a
target
he
timed
the
people
using
each
gun
the
revolver
times
were
pretty
close
but
some
of
the
times
with
the
sw
were
in
minutes
or
the
person
just
gave
up
because
they
could
not
figure
out
the
saftey
you
dont
often
see
colt
autos
issued
due
to
the
light
trigger
which
can
be
accidentally
fired
in
a
stress
situation
opening
the
issuing
citycounty
etc
to
lawsuits
bad
press
etc
of
course
any
problem
can
be
overcome
with
enough
training
but
such
training
is
not
always
available
to
budget
crunched
departments
i
know
if
i
were
a
cop
i
would
want
something
like
a
sw
just
for
the
off
chance
of
the
gun
getting
taken
away
the
safety
doesnt
guarantee
that
mr
bad
wont
figure
it
out
and
shoot
me
but
it
could
buy
enough
time
to
draw
a
second
gun
and
shoot
mr
bad
before
its
too
late
dont
think
i
am
too
biassed
here
just
because
i
have
had
glocks
in
my
possession
at
one
time
because
i
have
had
a
as
well
in
fact
it
was
my
first
handgun
remember
the
ultimate
safety
is
you
the
operator
and
no
safety
is
going
to
stop
an
negligent
discharge
note
i
dont
say
accidental
if
you
break
the
rules
of
gun
handling
as
per
the
part
of
being
light
weight
and
looking
cool
i
agree
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
as
a
first

this

an
indication
i
dont

you
or
that
youre
not

when
the
drop

is
relevant
acquiring

in

you
can
buy
almost
all
kinds
of
weapons
in

but
you
must
have
a
permit
and
a
good
reason
to
get
the
permit
if
i
would

have
a

i
would
have
to
get
an
gunlicence
from
the
police
and
to
be
a
member
of
a
gunclub
the
primary
objection
beyond
ones
based
on
the
ideal
of
rkba
that
it
is
simply
not
something
the
government
should
do
is
that
it
makes
guns
a
plaything
and
tool
of
the
rich
and
connected
it
discriminates
against
the
poor
is
selfdefense
considered
appropriate
and
if
so
under
what
conditions
are
you
allowed
for
instance
to
get
a
gun
for
protection
if
youre
going
to
be
carrying
a
very
large
sum
of
money
on
a
regular
basis
or
have
been
threatened
the
police
would
check
my
criminal
records
for
any
serious
crimes
andor
records
of
serious
mental
diseases
this
has
been
suggested
in
the
us
and
generally
supported
among
gun
owners
what
many
object
to
is
that
many
if
not
most
proposals
contain
a
sort
of
gotcha
clause
which
allows
an
arbitrary
denial
even
if
you
qualify
in
every
way
now
if
a
got
my
licence
i
would
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
gun
club
for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
at
this
point
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
general
a
drivers
licence
in
the
us
is
for
the
most
part
nothing
like
its
european
counterpart
i
understand
getting
one
is
far
more
difficult
there
than
here
in
the
us
its
a
joke
but
my
usual
objection
is
that
youre
discussing
two
different
things
for
instance
in
the
us
a
drivers
license
is
a
permit
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
on
a
public
road
it
is
not
necessary
to
own
one
or
to
operate
it
on
private
property
that
is
the
ability
to
require
driving
permits
is
generally
considered
to
arise
from
the
governments
legitimate
power
to
enact
reasonable
regulations
for
behavior
on
public
lands
a
permit
to
own
an
automobile
for
instance
which
is
far
closer
an
analogy
would
be
a
much
harder
thing
to
get
past
legally
since
it
wouldnt
be
based
on
making
regulations
on
public
property
but
in
restricting
activity
on
private
property
use
of
guns
in
crimes
in
norway
some
crimes
are
commited
with
guns
that
have
been
in
the
owners
arms
for
a
long
time
but
these
are
rather
the
exeption
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
this
varies
widely
one
thing
i
think
europeans
have
a
difficult
time
with
is
that
the
us
has
fifty
unique
jurisdictions
where
the
laws
from
one
state
to
another
can
be
as
radically
different
as
from
one
country
in
europe
to
another
some
places
allow
open
carry
of
both
guns
and
knives
some
allow
concealed
some
prohibit
both
or
allow
one
or
the
other
and
it
can
be
either
a
state
or
local
restriciton
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
the
question
must
be
asked
is
the
right
of
this
individual
affecting
the
rights
of
this
other
individual
what
we
usually
get
is
that
the
rights
of
this
group
meaning
some
individuals
within
this
group
here
defined
as
people
who
own
guns
are
adversely
affecting
the
rights
of
some
other
group
if
for
instance
bob
were
using
his
gun
to
attack
steve
youd
have
a
point
but
essentially
what
were
discussing
is
that
becuase
some
person
who
qualifies
as
a
member
of
the
group
people
who
own
guns
then
some
third
person
perhaps
in
another
time
zone
is
told
that
their
being
a
member
of
that
group
is
taking
away
somebody
elses
rights
its
like
trying
to
punish
all
newspapers
for
the
libel
commited
by
one
the
issue
i
believe
the
issue
is
guns
and
gunlegislation
the
issue
is
crime
violence
and
murder
the
question
is
to
what
extent
guns
and
gun
legislation
impact
those
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
of
course
not
it
would
be
nice
if
we
didnt
have
to
fear
that
other
people
might
get
it
into
their
twisted
little
minds
to
hurt
us
but
currently
we
dont
have
that
option
nor
do
i
expect
we
will
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns

states
do
no
state
does
in
any
case
theres
a
limit
to
which
the
state
may
enforce
its
wisdom
on
me
freedom
in
general
is
an
unwise
concept
if
you
preemptively
restrict
everything
which
might
be
unwise
then
freedom
becomes
a
meaningless
concept
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery

why
do
you

it
should

what
i

someone
tell

how

including
several

if

i
would
have
to
get
an

from
the

and
to
be
a

the

would
check
my

records
for
any
serious

andor
records

serious

now
if
a
got

i
would
have

of
the

for
months
before
i
could
collect
my
gun
so
like
what
do
you
do
during
those
six
months
to
be
active
my
town
has
a
similar
requirement
and
its
rather
stupid
before
you
can
buy
a
handgun
you
have
to
be
an
active
member
of
a
gun
club
well
how
active
can
you
be
without
a
gun
chief
most
gun
owners
feel
a
check
of
criminal
records
for
crimes
and
mental
disorders
would
be
a
very
good
thing
if
it
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
every
time
this
is
proposed
there
is
always
some
trapdoor
by
which
the
government
can
deny
your
purchase
even
if
you
are
perfectly
qualified
to
own
a
gun
and
we
oppose
this
its
a
little
like
getting
a
drivers
licence
isnt
it
you
have
to
prove
that
you
can
drive
before
you
are
allowed
to
since
the
fatal
accident
rate
for
licensed
automobile
drivers
in
the
us
is
around
times
the
fatal
accident
rate
of
largely
unlicensed
gun
owners
id
think
twice
before
using
this
analogy
besides
the
problem
is
criminal
use
of
guns
not
accidents
there
are
about
criminal
uses
of
guns
in
the
us
every
year
but
only
accidents
i
dont
think
its
necessary
to
spend
a
lot
of
energy
making
sure
a
criminal
can
shoot
a
gun
before
he
gets
one
just
like
the
check
most
gun
owners
feel
positively
about
requiring
safety
courses
if
they
couldnt
be
abused
by
the
government
but
they
already
have
one
state
doesnt
hold
the
courses
another
doesnt
fund
them
a
third
holds
them
only
once
a
year
with
limited
attendence
to
those
with
political
connections
is
this
fair
most
criminals
accuire
guns
to
use
them
in
crimes
and
mostly
short
time
befor
the
crime
and
how
many
of
them
acquire
these
guns
from
legal
retail
outlets
how
many
are
borrowed
stolen
smuggled
bought
on
the
black
market
use
of
knives
it
is
allowed
to
cary
knifes
in
public
but
not
in
your
belt
or
open
you
americans
think
its
ok
to
have
a
gun
but
not
to
carry
it
open
in
public
rigth
some
states
allow
only
open
carry
some
allow
only
concealed
carry
some
allow
both
some
allow
both
but
require
licenses
for
concealed
carry
all
you
can
say
is
if
one
of
these
modes
has
a
clear
advantage
over
another
in
terms
of
reducing
crime
or
any
other
public
good
then
state
legislators
someplace
are
doing
exactly
the
wrong
thing
which
means
that
they
really
dont
have
any
objective
reasons
for
these
laws
other
than
their
preferences
a
bad
way
to
govern
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not
as
hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
hotlivered
i
love
that
expression
here
we
say
hotheaded
individual
vs
masses
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
others
typically
the
only
criminals
who
can
affect
the
rights
of
all
the
other
people
are
criminals
in
government
offices
the
rest
of
our
criminals
affect
the
rights
of
only
one
or
a
few
people
at
a
time
and
they
do
this
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
possession
of
a
gun
by
someone
hurts
no
one
else
it
is
when
they
do
something
violent
with
that
gun
that
the
crime
occurs
of
course
it
is
a
crime
for
a
felon
or
exfelon
to
possess
a
gun
but
we
dont
feel
it
is
right
to
treat
common
citizens
who
have
lived
good
lives
as
if
they
were
just
prefelons
waiting
to
commit
crimes
we
shouldnt
mix
weapons
and
items
that
can
serve
as
one
i
dont
understand
this
sentence
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
life
isnt
fair
i
shouldnt
need
a
fire
extinguisher
either
or
flood
and
theft
insurance
or
to
lock
the
doors
of
my
house
and
car
but
pining
for
a
better
world
wont
do
anything
to
address
what
i
have
to
do
to
live
in
this
one
do
you

some

do
none

im

if
you

to
have

why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
frankly
im
not

i
know
what
good
a
drivers
license
does
anyone
either
the
people
who
drive
safely
never
use
it
and
the
people
who
drive
drunk
drive
without
it
however
a
car
is
a
good
tool
but
not
one
that
protects
my

i
rank
the
right

somewhere
north

freely
im
not

anti
gun
i
would
defend

loved
ones

country

i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence
or
because
they
feel
good
the
question
is
not
whether
or
not
you
want
to
own

personally
its
whether

not
you
think

all

should

our

started
the
day
with
a
rally
in
the
secluded
courtyard
behind
the
statehouse
at
it
was
looking
sparse
about
people
until
the
speaker
began
whereupon
about
more
people
followed
the
loudspeakers
from
wherever
they
had
been
lost
and
filled
out
the
area
something
proud
mike
yacino
of
goal
spoke
one
of
his
best
throwaway
lines
was
to
remind
us
that
all
of
us
holders
of
carry
permits
there
had
been
checked
and
certified
clear
of
all
crimes
by
the
state
while
the
people
in

behind
us
only
had
to
be

describing
all

to
be

at
the

and
telling
people
where
to
find
their

and
in
too
many
cases
who
they
were
mike
warned
us
that
the
committee
was
going
to
suspend
its
rules
and
discuss
a
bill
that
hadnt
made

who
shot
up

for
a
bill
to
ban
all

to
anyone
who
is
not
a

the
hearings
were
originally
scheduled
in
the
large
gardner

at
but
that
had
been
preempted
by
the
governors
hearings
on
the
framingham
eight
women
in
prison
for
killing
abusive
husbands
and
seeking
release
so
we
had
until
to
buttonhole
our
representatives
after
which
we
would
be
squashed
into
an
inadequate
hearing
room
one
of
my
representatives
staffers
was
somewhat
offensively
smarmy
he
said
oh
it
must
be
gun
hearings
day
again
the
gun
lobby
is
always
so
organized
every
year
i
got
a
little
pissed
and
replied
im
not
from
the
gun
lobby
im
from
your
district
at
your
second
reporter
arrived
in
time
to
notice
a

going
on

where

about

there
were
about

there
plus
another
students
and
teachers
from

one
of
us
had
already
reserved
a
seat
the
other
never
got
closer
than
the
atrium
outside
and
there
was
a
crowd
behind
him
a
cop
took
up
station
at
the
entrance
and
prevented
the
rest
of
the
crowd
from
coming
in
soon
after
the
debate
started
a
loudspeaker
was
set
up
outside
in
the
hall
for
the
benefit
of
everyone
else
everyone
who
was
there
inside
and
outside
got
to
sign
up
on
a
sheet
saying
what
their
position
was
on
which
bills
most
of
us
signed
up
to
support
goals
position
on
all
bills
first
because
of
their
time
constraints
public
officials
got
to
testify
and
first
up
was
the
bill
that
nobody
had
seen
the
students
had
some
curfew
i
guess
currently
massachusetts
law
allows
a
nonresident
to
purchase
long
guns
or
ammo
from
a
local
dealer
provided
he
complies
with
the
laws
of
his
own
state
previously
the
law
was
similar
but
applied
only
to
nonresidents
from
states
adjoining
massachusetts
the
simons
rock
folks
called
the
current
law
a
loophole
and
wanted
it
closed
two
of
their

spoke
about

and
his

a

had

so
well
that

kept
confusing

bill
would
put
the
law
back
the
way
it
was
but
he
was
lying
the
new
bill
allows
purchases
by
nonresidents
of
adjoining
states
only
if
they
have
licensing
in
their
own
state
as
strong
as
that
in
massachusetts
since
none
of
them
do
thats
that
some
of
the
things
these
two
said
were
really
offensive
in
some
of
these
other
states
anyone
can
buy
a
gun
as
long
as
hes
breathing
oooooo
we
have
some
very
very
good
gun
laws
in
massachusetts
if
only
the
other
states
would
adopt
the
same
type
of
laws
we
wouldnt
be
having
this
situation
but
they
wont
naughty
naughty
next
up
was
boston
city
councilman
albert
dapper
oneill
he
was
there
to
testify
progun
but
in
some
ways
he
was
a
liability
hes
reasonably
elderly
and
tends
to
wander
and
repeat
himself
plus
hes
almost
a
caricature
of
a
lawnorder
politician
he
badmouthed
the
aclu
said
violent
criminals
should
be
executed
and
that
if
he
were
judge
hed
give
arrestees
their
last
rights
pun
intended
on
the
spot
at
which
many
of
the
gun
owners
applauded
which
bothered
me
he
said
that
all
the
proposed
gun
restrictions
were
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
the
criminals
he
said
this
four
times
two
of
the
bills
under
consideration
would
allow
police
to
rescind
a
ccw
or
fid
and
confiscate
all
your
guns
if
someone
had
filed
a
restraining
order
against
you
note
that
the
filing
of
a
restraining
order
requires
no
warrant
no
hearing
no
evidence
and
no
conviction
just
an
accusation
senator
barrett
of
reading
testified
in
favor
of
it
and
patronized
the
progunners
there
several
times
by
saying
im
sure
all
the
gun
owners
here
will
agree
with
me
that
we
have
to
get
these
weapons
out
of
the
hands
of
people
that
our
courts
have
convicted
i
havent
seen
such
a
disgustingly
disingenuous
performance
since
nixon
whined
that
he
wasnt
a
crook
barrett
also
spoke
in
favor
of
the
bill
making
the
fid
card
renewable
every
five
years
instead
of
permanent
as
it
is
now
the
stated
purpose
is
to
remove
fid
cards
from
those
who
have
become
ineligible
revenue
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
yeah
right
apparently
some
congressmen
think
were
stupid
enough
to
swallow
the
argument
that
its
preferable
to
process
million
renewals
every
cycle
in
the
vague
hope
of
catching
a
recent
felon
than
to
simply
take
the
goddamn
card
away
from
a
criminal
at
conviction
time
as
usual
hassle
the
lawabiding
instead
of
the
crook
the
two
cochairs
of
the
committee
were
rep
caron
and
sen
jujuga
jujuga
didnt
say
much
he
was
a
cosponsor
of
both
restraining
order
bills
but
caron
struck
me
as
a
sharp
guy
that
wouldnt
let
any
bad
logic
or
lies
on
the
part
of
either
side
to
go
unchallenged
he
was
a
cosponsor
of
one
of
the
restraining
order
bills
as
well
one
of
the
younger
reps
on
the
committee
forgot
his
name
was
vociferously
progun
somewhat
embarrassingly
so
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
but
his
arguments
seemed
to
be
confined
to
every
year
its
the
same
damn
thing
you
come
in
here
with
this
crap
its
nice
to
have
a
friend
on
the
committee
but
he
could
have
been
more
effective
at
about
it
was
clear
that
the
halljam
couldnt
continue
someone
came
out
of
another
meeting
hall
and
yelled
at
the
cop
because
the
loudspeaker
was
disturbing
their
meeting
so
the
loudspeaker
was
disconnected
so
they
found
a
bigger
hall
upstairs
one
of
us
had
to
leave
to
catch
his
charter
bus
and
so
missed
the
public
testimony
the
other
got
a
seat
this
time
caron
began
by
talking
about
how
he
got
his
fid
years
ago
left
the
state
and
then
returned
without
notifying
them
of
his
address
change
he
complained
that
the
state
record
system
was
not
uptodate
and
that
his
pd
back
in
his
city
of
birth
still
thought
he
lived
there
great
quote
if
you
purchase
a
gun
today
it
will
not
get
into
the
state
computer
system
until
this
was
also
an
argument
he
used
against
the
renewable
fid
card
testimony
was
heard
from
several
battered
women
one
of
whom
had
been
attacked
by
some
guy
in
his
who
had
an
fid
card
because
he
got
it
when
he
was
or
thereabouts
they
used
a
lot
of
emotion
and
said
how
they
were
scared
of
these
men
a
staffer
of
attorney
general
harshbarger
testified
in
favor
of
this
antigun
bill
saying
how
restraining
orders
were
granted
last
year
and
how
these
women
needed
to
be
protected
caron
noted
that
a
restraining
order
was
granted
for
days
and
then
a
hearing
was
held
to
determine
whether
the
order
would
be
extended
to
a
year
he
asked
whether
she
would
be
satisfied
if
the
fid
were
revoked
at
the
time
of
this
hearing
rather
than
after
the
initial
issuance
of
the
fid
she
gave
some
long
rambling
circumlocution
in
response
then
testimony
against
the
bill
was
heard
mike
yacino
who
looks
something
like
einstein
got
up
and
made
the
point
that
restraining
orders
were
issued
on
too
little
evidence
that
judges
like
to
issue
restraining
orders
just
to
let
things
cool
off
no
matter
who
they
think
is
right
man
or
woman
and
that
the
hearings
for
restraining
orders
are
lightning
sessions
with
little
time
to
consider
facts
atty
karen
mcnutt
spoke
with
him
a
few
times
during
his
testimony
other
progunners
got
up
to
testify
one
said
he
had
had
to
file
a
restraining
order
against
a
tenant
to
clear
her
out
and
that
she
countered
by
filing
one
against
him
he
noted
that
this
would
have
allowed
the
state
to
confiscate
his
guns
if
the
new
bill
became
law
one
of
the
junior
reps
noted
that
this
is
america
and
we
have
to
be
certain
that
individual
rights
are
respected
senator
jujuga
reiterated
this
saying
that
people
who
abuse
smaller
people
can
go
to
hell
as
far
as
i
care
but
we
have
to
be
careful
about
equating
conviction
with
a
restraining
order
point
and
match
senator
another
progunner
got
up
and
testified
that
he
didnt
know
his
citizenship
expired
every
years
and
that
a
drivers
license
was
a
privilege
not
a
right
like
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
a
third
got
up
and
said
the
problem
was
with
the
criminal
justice
system
and
argued
in
favor
of
a
death
penalty
bill
and
public
hangings
senator
jujuga
said
he
had
himself
tried
to
get
a
death
penalty
bill
passed
and
joking
responded
that
he
too
favored
public
hangings
the
speaker
then
responded
ill
make
you
a
deal
you
get
me
the
rope
and
ill
tie
the
noose
next
came
public
testimony
on
the
simons
rock
bill
a
teacher
testified
that
she
had
been
the
teacher
of
wayne
lo
and
that
he
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
shoot
people
inside
a
building
while
he
was
outside
without
his
evil
gun
she
said
that
the
loophole
should
be
closed
to
prevent
something
like
this
from
ever
happening
again
four
or
five
other
kids
testified
in
favor
of
this
bill
one
of
spilling
tears
for
the
good
legislators
one
of
the
students
actually
shot
by
wayne
lo
was
also
there
many
of
them
had
t
shirts
on
saying
as
long
as
one
person
can
buy
a
gun
in
anger
none
of
us
are
safe
support
gun
control
the
committee
was
reluctant
to
grill
or
correct
the
kids
except
for
caron
who
corrected
one
student
who
had
claimed
that
anyone
could
apply
for
an
fid
only
residents
can
get
fids
he
said
how
much
do
you
want
to
bet
that
this
kid
had
no
idea
he
had
been
conned
into
testifying
for
a
bill
that
would
cut
outofstaters
completely
off
yacino
and
mcnutt
spoke
again
this
time
noting
that
the
bill
as
written
would
affect
both
ammo
and
all
guns
possessed
by
outofstaters
karen
also
noted
that
hunters
in
ct
nh
and
vt
could
be
put
away
for
a
year
if
they
wandered
across
the
ma
boundary
somewhere
in
the
woods
and
got
challenged
by
game
wardens
yacino
underscored
the
fact
that
lo
could
have
gotten
an
fid
as
a
resident
student
and
hell
even
an
ccw
as
he
had
no
criminal
or
mental
record
one
junior
rep
was
upset
that
it
would
take
ma
residents
longer
to
buy
a
gun
than
outofstaters
and
thought
it
was
elitist
another
caron
said
that
we
need
the
protection
of
preventing
nonresidents
from
buying
without
an
fid
because
only
two
other
states
in
the
union
had
fidtype
cards
so
complying
with
all
the
laws
of
ones
home
state
was
not
enough
one
progun
speaker
replied
that
this
resembled
a
mother
watching
her
son
in
a
marching
band
and
exclaiming
everyones
out
of
step
but
johnny
all
the
bard
college
people
were
filing
out
as
the
progun
testimony
for
this
bill
was
made
and
thus
only
progunners
were
around
when
the
other
bills
came
under
consideration
the
main
bills
remaining
and
goals
position
were
o
and
four
others
notify
police
chiefs
so
they
can
pull
licenses
when
a
holder
is
convicted
strongly
supported
o
require
trigger
locks
on
all
handguns
sold
opposed
o
require
trigger
locks
on
all
loaded
firearms
strongly
opposed
o
allow
every
municipality
to
enact
their
own
gun
laws
opposed
o
fund
bulletproof
vests
for
municipal
police
supported
o
state
constitutional
amendment
for
the
rkba
supported
o
several
on
police
discretion
in
the
issuance
of
fid
cards
opposed
o
several
altering
nonresident
license
conditions
supported
o
ban
damn
near
all
guns
everywhere
in
the
state
guess
some
of
these
took
only
seconds
to
consider
as
the
remaining
progunners
raised
hands
in
unison
either
for
or
against
them
mike
yacino
noted
that
besides
the
danger
in
screwing
with
a
trigger
lock
on
a
loaded
gun
that
bill
would
make
it
illegal
for
a
licensee
to
carry
his
concealed
handgun
unless
it
were
locked
caron
blew
right
through
when
he
saw
that
we
opposed
it
again
he
brought
up
the
states
archaic
records
capability
and
said
this
would
create
hundreds
of
different
licensing
systems
the
session
ran
late
since
it
was
the
last
scheduled
hearing
it
could
not
be
adjourned
until
everyone
who
wanted
to
had

the

is
bull
in

but
im
curious
to
know
do
they
plan
on
making
it
a
requirement
to
always

or
is
it
only
going

be
required

be
presented
when
trying
to
ge
medical

this
at
least
has
already
been
determined
the
blue
cross
medical
coverage
for
all
federal
employees
is
a
good
model
for
a
future
national
system
to
get
emergency
medical
care
anyone
so
insured
must
always
carry
their
blue
cross
card
before
entering
a
hospital
you
must
notify
blue
cross
or
they
will
refuse
to
pay
your
bills
in
an
emergency
where
you
must
be
treated
before
notifying
them
you
must
inform
them
within
hours
or
if
you
are
unable
to
do
so
for
medical
reasons
the
hospital
must
failing
to
do
so
within
hours
means
they
will
not
cover
the
hospitalization
in
you
need
your
card
to
notify
them
and
without
the
card
the
hospital
certainly
wouldnt
know
they
had
to
therefore
you
are
required
to
carry
the

at

do

says
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
there
are
many
many
bad
things
going
on
in
that
area
also
i
have
several
friends
that
live
very
close
to
that
area
who
have
had
problems
with
some
of
these
folks
by
the
way
where
did
i
say
that
they
were
minorities
do
you
think
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
if
you
would
have
been
there
andy
it
wouldve
been
obvious
to
you
too
of
course
it
might
not
have
been
who
knows
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
was
there
i
live
here
and
i
know
that
they
were
gang
bangers
when
you
live
here
long
enough
it
becomes
pretty
easy
to
spot
them
via
gang
colors
gang
signs
etc
one
last
thing
my
sister
is
a
social
worker
she
makes
it
her
point
to
find
these
things
out
gang
signs
colors
etc
because
it
is
in
her
best
interest
to
do
so
she
is
nice
enough
to
let
me
know
these
things
so
i
can
watch
out
for
myself
as
i
live
right

i

it

to
me
that

has
censored
gun
ads
in

likewise
for

and
i
have
never
seen
a

in
the
san

examiner
specifically
about
a
year
ago
on
thursdays
when
traders
placed
its
ads
the
chron
ad
would
not
have
any
graphics
representing
any
handgun
sale
though
text
could
list
it
the
trib
would
run
a
graphic
of
a
handgun
the
examiner
would
not
have
a
traders
ad
at
all
over
the
past
year
while
oakland
politicians
have
made
a
lot
of
noise
about
measures
to
fight
crime
the
trib
stopped
taking
the
traders
ad
then
started
publishing
it
but
without
any
handgun
graphic
then
stopped
then
started
since
the
trib
was
sold
some
months
ago
it
has
not
had
the

during
one
of

a

do
you

how
many

are

by
people
wearing

there
are
roughly
fatal

each

the
large
majority
involve

there
are
under
fatal
handgun
accidents
each
year
i
really
doubt
all
of
those
occur
while
the
pistol
is
holstered
so
the
number
of
selfinflicted
gunshot
wounds
by
people
wearing
thigh
holsters
is
probably
well
under
per
year
if
you
fall
for
example
and
land
on
the
handgun
or
cause
a
sudden
blow
the
gun
will
discharge

designs
have
included
a
hammer
block
since
around
or
earlier
this
is
a
metal
part
which
physically
seperates
the
cartridge
and
the
firing
pin
even
under
impact
the
gun
cannot
fire
the
hammer
block
is
connected
to
the
trigger
and
is
pulled
out
of
the
way
as
the
trigger
is
pulled
as
a
result
modern
pistols
can
fire
only
if
the
trigger
is
pulled
or
in
some
cases
if
they
are
cocked
by
hand
and
then
dropped
the
number
of
people
killed
in
this
manner
far
outweighs
the
number
of
deaths
caused
by
animal
attacks
or
wacko
attacks
combined
i
dont
know
about
animal
attacks
but
there
are
murders
each
year
and
under
die
in
the
manner
you
suggest
if
only
of
the
murders
were
killings
by
wackos
you
would
be
wrong
worse
there
are
also
rapes
and
aggravated
assaults
each
year
these
numbers
make
violent
attacks
and
preventing
them
thousands
of
times
more
significant
than

ten

dennis

in
these
and
similar
areas
the
bureau
has
violated
not
only
the
dictates
of
common
sense
but
of
usc
sec
which
was
intended
to
prevent
secret
lawmaking
by
administrative
bodies
these
practices
amply
documented
in
hearings
before
this
sub
committee
leave
little
doubt
that
the
bureau
has
disregarded
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
it
has
trampled
upon
the
second
amendment
by
chilling
exercise
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
by
lawabiding
citizens
it
has
offended
the
fourth
amendment
by
unreasonably
search
ing
and
seizing
private
property
it
has
ignored
the
fifth
amendment
by
taking
private
property
without
just
compensation
and
by
entrapping
honest
citizens
with
out
regard
for
their
right
to
due
process
of

the
rebuttal
presented
to
the
subcommittee
by
the
bureau
was
utterly
unconvincing
richard
davis
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
treasury
department
asserted
vaguely
that
the
bureaus
priorities
were
aimed
at
prosecuting
willful
violators
particularly
felons
ille
gally
in
possession
and
at
confiscating
only
guns
actually
likely
to
be
used
in
crime
he
also
asserted
that
the
bureau
has
recently
made
great
strides
toward
achieving
these
priorities
no
documen
tation
was
offered
for
either
of
these
assertions
in
hearings
before
batfs
appropriations
subcommittee
however
expert
evidence
was
submitted
establishing
that
approximately
percent
of
batf
gun
prosecutions
were
aimed
at
ordinary
citizens
who
had
neither
criminal
intent
nor

of
alcohol

and
firearms
atf
which
is
the
federal
law
enforcement
agency
with
jurisdiction
over
firearms
violations
and
regulations
it
has
been
my
experience
as
chairman
of
the
appropriations
subcommittee
on
treasury
postal
service
and
general
government
which
funds
atf
that
atf
is
one
of
the
most
competent
and
highly
professional
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
federal
government
the
agents
of
atf
have
proven
their
value
again
and
again
in
successful
legal
operations
to
curb
the
unlawful
possession
and
use
of
firearms
especially
in
the
area
of
drugrelated
crimes
it
enforces
the
armed
career
criminal
act
which
calls
for
mandatory
minimum
sentences
for
repeat
felons
using
firearms
to
carry
out
an
illegal
activity
the
bureau
has
made
itself
a
key
component
in
preventing
gang
related
violence
also
both
by
educating
atrisk
youth
to
the
dangers
of
gang
membership
as
well
a
s
by
depriving
known
gangs
from
access
to
weapons
the
waco
texas
case
involved
the
execution
of
search
warrants
by
atf
on
the
branch
davidians
for
illegal
firearms
and
explosives
possession
automatics
semiautomatics
and
machineguns
in
addition
to
bombs
and
other
explosives
in
virtually
every
gun
case
atf
is
asked
to
trace
weapons
through
its
national
firearms
tracing
center
where
they
keep
all
dealer
and
federal
firearms
license
information
atf
is
the
federal
governments
firearms
expert
and
routinely
works
with
state
and
local
police
to
execute
warrants
atf
working
with
state
and
local
law
enforcement
in
texas
and
the
us
attorneys
office
felt
it
was
necessary
to
execute
these
warrants
in
order
to
legally
establish
that
a
crime
had
been
committed
and
conclude
a
long
and
thorough
investigation
of
illegal
gun
and
explosives
held
by
members
of
the
branch
davidians
in
addition
atf
carefully
selected
a
sunday
morning
knowing
from
their
source
inside
that
the
men
would
be
separated
from
the
women
and
children
and
not
in
the
area
where
it
was
known
that
the
illegal
weapons
were
stored
as
you
may
be
aware
by
now
vernon
howell
aka
david
koresh
spiritual
leader
of
the
branch
davidians
was
tipped
of
the
impending
execution
of
the
search
warrants
unfortunately
atf
lost
the
element
of
surprise
and
the
cult
was
able
to
arm
themselves
and
prepare
for
atfs
entry
into
the
compound
once
a
hostage
situation
presented
itself
the
atf
asked
the
fbi
to
become
involved
since
the
fbi
is
skilled
in
hostage
negotiations
in
addition
and
military
tanks
were
brought
in
due
to
the
serious
nature
of
the
situation
and
firepower
of
the
branch
davidians
based
on
what
i
have
learned
about
atfs
role
in
the
branch
davidian
raid
i
believe
the
agency
acted
responsibly
i
am
however
deeply
saddened
by
the
loss
of
lives
of
the
law
enforcement
agents
who
attempted
to
enter
the
compound
and
the
civilian
members
of
the
cult
i
fully
expect
the
department
of
treasury
to
conduct
a
thorough
evaluation
with
representatives
from
law
enforcement
outside
the
department
to
be
headed
by
the
assistant
secretary
for
enforcement
in
addition
atf
will
conduct
its
own
review
of
the
waco
operation
i
look
forward
to
reviewing
the
findings
of
the
evaluators
and
hope
this
situation
in

will
be
brought
to
a
quick

inferior
to
them
in
discipline
and
the
use
of
arms
who
stand
ready
to
defend
their
own
rights
and
those
of
their
fellowcitizens
but
surely
hamilton
and
madison
didnt
mean
the
people
when
they
said
people
right
thats
why
the
amendment
refers
to
the
right
of
the
militia
your
average
year
old
male
does
not
fall
into
the
definition
youre
right
the
militia
consists
of
all
able
bodied
males
and
probably
females
under
current
interpretation
therefore
most
members
of
the
militia
the
one
the
every
gun
advocate
refers
to
are
not
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
and
therefore
are
not
directly
the
amendment
does
nor
refer
to
well
organized
it
says
well
regulated
i
have
some
targets
you
may
examine
if
you
wish
to
check
how
well
regulated
i
am
mentioned
in
the
amendment
if
this
amendment
wanted
to
allow
every
member
of
the
militia
to
keep
and
bear
arms
why
did
it
specificly
mention
a
well
organized
militia
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
correct
thats
why
the
right
is
reserved
to
the
people
and
that
was
to
insure
the
people
could
form
a
well
regulated
militia
not
a
well
organized
militia
it
could
be
argued
that
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
is
separate
from
the
last
part
if
so
why
was
it
include
in
the
same
atomic
unit
of
written
what
do
atomic
units
have
to
do
with
this
argument
any
moron
can
set
hbar
c
instead
of
a
separate
sentence
oh
i
see
what
your
question
is
why
dont
you
read
the
federalist
papers
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
but
what
does
madison
know
about
the
grammatical
style
of
the
he
only
wrote
it
the
amendment
also
implies
that
the
right
to
arms
has
to
due
with
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
federalist
papers
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
gives
many
examples
of
how
this
militia
protects
the
security
of
a
free
state
all
these
examples
are
actions
of
a
very
organized
force
not
some
john
q
public
with
a
gun
thats
obviously
because
youve
never
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
is
that
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulated
militias
shall
not
be
infringed
that
is
people
have
the
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
this
well
organized
militia
will
of
course
provide
training
in
how
to
use
arms
and
in
basic
military
tactics
these
training
members
of
the
militia
can
keep
and
bear
the
arms
cant
read
huh
show
me
where
the
document
says
well
organized
militia
lastly
reading
through
the
federalist
papers
on
well
organized
militia
it
is
very
clear
that
many
of
the
reasons
for
these
militias
one
reason
stated
is
the
protection
from
a
standing
army
these
days
the
standing
army
could
easily
defeat
a
group
consisting
of
every
year
old
male
and
female
not
in
the
armied
forces
that
is
exactly
why
every
person
should
be
allowed
to
own
any
weapon
currently
in
use
in
the
armed
forces
another
reason
stated
for
well
organized
militias
is
to
reduced
the
need
for
a
standing
army
well
the
us
armied
forces
have
been
a
standing
army
for
more
than
half
the
history
of
the
us
but
the
major
reason
is
to
protect
against
that
very
same
army
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
reason
for
the
second
amendment
to
give
the
people
protection
from
the
us
government
by
guaranteeing
that
the
people
can
over
through
the
government
if
necessary
is
a
little
bit
of
an
anachronism
is
this
day
and
age
maybe
its
time
to
rethink
how
this
should
be
done
and
amend
the
constitution

you
know
ahhh
talkpoliticsguns
the
kindler
gentler
newsgroup
who
would
have
thought
no
not
exactly
the
only
reason
for
this
sort
of
restriction
is
the
possible
endangerment
of
others
a
poorly
maintained
rifle
is
dangerous
but
only
to
the
user
since
it
doesnt
endanger
others
there
is
no
justification
for
such
restrictions
i
remind
you
of
shrapnel
i
consider
a
reasonable
space
limitation
but
make
no
mistake
a
gun
blowing
up
is
a
hazard
to
those
nearby
say
in
the
next
lane
at
the
range
my
point
was
at
what
distance
or
level
of
threat
we
draw
the
line
is
it
the
endangerment
of
others
so
we
do
a
restriction
or
the
possibility
of
being
shot
hence
we
draw
a
mile
restriction
or
a
nuke
and
draw
a
mile
restriction
to
me
they
al
suffer
from
the
fundamental
flaw
that
they
restrict
based
upon
the
instrument
rather
than
placing
the
responsibility
for
usage
squarely
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
user
perhaps
sen
metzenbaum
declaring
the
barrett
light
fifty
an
assault
rifle
has
made
this
more
apparent
to
me
since
the
barrett
has
only
range
and
acurracy
going
for
it
they
have
determined
that
their
lives
are
worth
the
effort
to
protect
their
homes
and
families
using
nuclear
weapons
close
to
home
will
not
accomplish
this
i
disagree
on
the
grounds
that
a
house
can
be
rebuilt
much
more
easily
than
my
family
once
i
have
died
i
assume
that
word
would
get
to
the
citizens
that
such
an
attack
was
planned
if
this
is
not
the
case
the
tactical
and
strategic
implications
change
quite
a
bit
personally
my
home
is
worth
say
twenty
martians
intent
on
taking
over
the
world
my
family
all
of
them
the
balancing
act
here
is
hard
to
judge
sitting
at
my
desk
there
is
however
another
problem
in
any
case
of
civil
war
the
strength
of
the
militias
fighting
on
each
side
should
reflect
the
popular
will
if
the
public
is
split
versus
then
the
minorities
militias
should
be
at
a
disadvantage
such
a
need
for
popular
support
would
hopefully
prevent
insurrections
unless
the
people
really
were
behind
the
rebels
but
heavy
weapons
owned
by
a
small
fraction
of
the
militia
could
distort
this
what
if
the
minority
included
all
the
tank
and
artillery
owners
that
seems
to
be
the
case
already
given
that
heavy
weapons
arent
commonly
owned
by
the
citizenry
with
such
low
numbers
obviously
due
to
cost
i
dont
think
the
superior
weapons
are
going
to
be
of
great
effect
against
a
numerically
superior
foe
furthermore
it
is
even
more
doubtful
their
training
includes
proper
tactical
movements
that
best
utilize
tanks
whereas
the
commonly
rifleman
is
not
so
hampered
in
effectiveness
i
think
it
is
vital
to
avoid
such
a
situation
where
a
small
minority
would
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
gaining
political
power
through
violence
to
prevent
this
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
control
of
heavy
weapons
eg
those
which
only
a
small
number
of
individuals
would
own
and
whose
firepower
would
grossly
distort
the
relation
between
popular
support
and
military
strength
to
someone
other
that
individual
militiamen
this
is
certainly
not
a
good
thing
but
i
think
it
is
the
lesser
of
two
evils
whoever
controls
these
weapons
must
be
a
democratic
body
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
i
had
envisioned
that
the
armorer
perhaps
the
officers
of
a
select
group
and
the
like
would
exercise
control
over
the
heavier
more
complex
weapons
but
if
joe
bob
owns
an
old
sherman
tank
i
certainly
wouldnt
ask
him
to
give
it
up
follow
orders
from
the
officers
yes
since
the
expense
of
a
tank
is
so
large
though
chances
are
it
would
be
jointly
purchased
and
should
therefore
be
jointly
maintained
and
operated
here
i
think
we
have
to
be
carefull
about
which
state
we
are
talking
about
certainly
one
role
of
the
militia
is
to
overthrow
a
repressive
government
and
it
would
be
completely
destructive
to
that
end
for
that
same
government
to
control
the
militias
arms
but
the
united
states
have
several
levels
of
government
each
able
to
act
independently
but
not
all
likely
targets
of
rebelion
as
such
rebelions
against
state
and
local
governments
are
very
unlikely
i
think
therefore
that
the
state
or
possibly
local
governments
could
safely
be
allowed
to
keep
the
select
militias
heavy
weapons
the
risk
of
abuse
while
still
something
to
consider
is
far
less
than
the
similar
risk
were
the
federal
government
in
control
this
ill
agree
with
to
a
point
the
state
having
control
over
the
heavy
weapons
should
not
be
justification
for
the
state
to
have
them
centrally
located
keep
them
spread
out
such
that
the
ability
of
the
state
to
lock
them
up
isnt
so
easy
otherwise
i
would
have
to
assume
that
state
control
would
rest
on
the
authority
of
the
governor
and
militia
officers
that
is
eaxctly
why
i
think
they
should
be
removed
the
select
militia
should
privide
the
militias
heavy
weapons
and
highlytrained
specialists
for
the
reasons
i
have
outlines
above
i
think
these
heavy
weapons
tanks
artillery
aircraft
etc
are
better
off
being
kept
by
local
governments
than
by
a
small
number
of
individuals
however
local
governments
shouldnt
be
able
to
use
the
select
militia
without
the
support
to
the
people
ideally
the
general
militia
under
the
direct
control
of
the
people
and
the
select
militia
under
the
direction
of
democratic
local
governments
would
opperate
together
but
even
in
the
worst
case
the
general
militia
should
be
able
to
functional
without
the
select
militia
similarly
the
select
militia
should
be
incapable
of
action
without
the
aid
of
the
general
militia
im
having
a
hard
time
seeing
how
these
heavy
weapons
fairly
few
in
numbers
could
not
be
easily
wielded
by
a
few
people
with
government
support
just
as
you
argued
above
that
the
weapons
should
be
divvied
up
and
under
democratic
control
so
one
side
doesnt
have
all
of
them
i
cant
see
where
this
situation
is
alleviated
in
having
the
select
militia
holding
all
the
weapons
and
the
unorganized
militia
being
the
infantry
i
think
a
better
mix
is
called
for
but
i
would
argue
that
the
federal
army
should
rely
upon
the
select
militia
and
the
unorganized
militia
for
the
bulk
of
its
infantry
units
consider
then
the
effect
of
removing
the
national
guards
infantry
and
placing
the
guard
under
the
control
of
local
governments
the
governmentcontroled
select
militia
could
not
fight
effectively
without
infantry
support
provided
by
the
general
militia
an
inherently
infantry
organization
on
the
other
hand
the
general
militia
could
function
although
at
a
disadvantage
without
the
backing
of
local
governments
and
the
select
militia
we
have
to
assume
that
there
would
be
those
who
would
side
with
the
governmentcontrolled
forces
and
if
theyve
all
the
equipment
an
infantry
force
the
size
would
be
in
trouble
id
like
to
see
that
heavy
stuff
say
tanks
offset
by
the
local
troups
having
a
few
and
antitank
weapons
in
their
armory
these
would
be
much
more
useful
to
infantry
than
the
tank
would
be
when
cost
and
training
requirements
are
figured
in
i
suppose
im
quibbling
over
what
constitutes
heavy
equipment
but
a
mechanized
infantry
unit
is
what
builds
dikes
in
times
of
flood
sets
up
disaster
relief
cities
and
the
like
i
would
much
rather
see
these
things
handled
by
the
local
general
militias
so
would
i
but
the
resources
often
arent
available
to
outfit
local
units
well
enough
thus
we
will
certainly
have
to
call
in
others
and
a
mechanized
unit
carries
more
stuff
faster
than
anything
else
perhaps
the
national
guard
isnt
as
close
to
my
conception
of
the
select
militia
as
i
thought
i
was
considering
them
to
be
the
heavy
weaponsarmor
arm
of
the
militia
not
the
infantry
arm
of
the
regular
army
perhaps
our
ideas
of
heavy
weapons
are
different
i
think
main
battle
tanks
selfpropelled
artillery
and
and
up
field
pieces
are
heavy
stuff
troop
carriers
ton
trucks
humvees
old
tanks
howitzers
are
more
the
stuff
of
a
mechanized
infantry
actually
this
is
what
the
guard
units
in
iowa
are
currently
fielding
in
some
units
perhaps
it
is
just
my
innate
fear
of
having
the
real
heavy
equipment
under
state
control
with
little
but
numbers
and
light
stuff
to
act
as
a
deterrent
allowing
main
battle
tanks
to
the
states
should
be
balanced
with
antitank
capability
in
the
local
ranks
similarly
local
units
would
need
to
band
together
quickly
hence
small
and
fast
response
means
mechanized
infantry
finally
the
militia
is
more
than
just
fighting
equipment
is
needed
for
other
responses
the
federal
army
im
convinced
should
have
a
very
minumum
of
infantry
relying
on
the
state
and
local
militias
for
these
functions

there

personal

some

are

the

accuire

befor

strange
that
the

killing

is
much
more

use

it

think
its

to

also
attract
a
lot
of
attention
doing
this
id
rather
be
lost
in
a
crowd
of
one
than
be
the
subject
of
attention
while
carrying
a
weapon
think
of
the
word
intimidation
and
you
can
see
where
intimidation
is
not
the
preferable
method
for
the
normal
citizen
scandinavians
are
aggressive
we
northeners
are
not
as
hotlivered
as
southeners
but
when
we
decide
to
take
action
we
do
ask
any
historian
or
millitary
with
an
knowledge
of
europe
or
ask
any
german
who
served
in
norway
in
aggressive
towards
whom
southerners
germans
precisely
why
i
think
your
society
is
less
violent
weapons
aside
yes
the
individual
is
more
important
than
the
masses
but
only
to
some
extent
your
criminal
laws
are
to
protect
the
individuals
who
makes
the
masses
what
happens
when
the
rigths
of
some
individuals
affects
the
rights
of
all
the
masses
editor
barf
dan
then
the
masses
have
the
same
rights
as
the
individuals
because
everything
comes
down
to
the
individual
in
one
instance
or
another
to
draw
an
analogy
norway
is
involved
in
the
eec
the
usa
in
involved
in
nato
the
eec
requires
certain
changes
in
your
laws
nato
requires
no
such
changes
in
usa
law
these
laws
affect
citizens
and
hence
norway
is
saying
europe
is
more
important
than
say
norwegians
having
motorcycles
that
make
over
in
the
usa
wed
likely
tell
the
eec
to
get
stuffed
since
the
eec
has
no
business
in
our
eyes
in
telling
us
how
much
horsepower
we
can
safely
ride
while
i
note
that
our
own
state
governments
often
play
with
game
with
the
federal
government
in
essence
this
is
a
cultural
difference
between
us
if
i
lived
in
amerika
i
would
probably
have
a
gun
to
defend
myselfe
in
home
but
should
it
have
to
be
like
that
it
shouldnt
since
neither
of
our
countries
has
managed
to
remove
criminals
from
society
in
america
we
feel
and
remember
we
have
individual
states
that
are
larger
than
your
country
that
if
the
police
cannot
protect
us
then
we
must
do
so
ourselves
the
criminals
in
our
country
are
quite
violent
hence
we
prepare
for
them
do
you
think
its
wise
to
sell
guns
like
candy
some
states
do
if
you
believe
its
smartneccacery
to
have
driverslicence
why
do
you
think
it
should
be
free
to
buy
guns
we
dont
email
me
to
find
out
just
how
difficult
it
really
is
in
this
country
it
is
easier
than
in
yours
but
theft
is
far
easier
than
the
troubles
we
go
through
to
purchase
over
here
i
would
defend
my
home
loved
ones
and
country
but
i
dont
view
guns
as
neccities
or
toys
they
are
neither
they
are
an
option
we
would
never
force
you
to
own
guns
if
you
lived
here
we
would
however
fight
to
keep
that
option
open
to
you
i
have
done
army
service
and
have
used
a
variaty
of
weapons
but
wouldnt
want
to
have
one
for
self
defence
or
because
they
feel
good
then
you
show
you
are
a

rational
user

welcome

how

even
though
i
find
this
to
be
funny
on

the
original

of
the

has
tried
and
convicted
the
members
of
the
bd
to
be
a
bunch
of
nuts
this
may
be
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
is
my
opinion
that
most
educated
or
well
informed
people
of
this
country
have
some
distrust
of
the
government
this
should
exist
because
as
a
bureaucracy
any
government
given
enough
time
will
tend
to
exist
for
it
self
and
not
for
the
original
purpose
it
was
created
for
this
distrust
by
the
people
should
keep
those
in
power
inline
that
and
a
properly
functioning
press
when
a
sensationalism
oriented
press
portrays
a
group
of
people
as
nuts
or
crazies
a
violation
of
those
peoples
civil
rights
seem
justified
since
we
as
americans
have
the
gurantee
of
rights
as
enumerated
in
the
constitution
to
include
the
ammendment
the
government
must
appease
the
publics
opinion
or
risk
voted
out
of
existance
or
if
it
has
become
corrupt
enough
to
tamper
with
domocratic
process
itself
being
thrown
out
by
force
our
government
as
it
stands
must
appease
the
public
therefore
the
official
press
releases
portray
the
bds
as
fanatics
who
are
a
threat
to
public
safety
we
must
not
prejudge
people
based
on
one
sided
information
so
far
the
only
information
that
we
are
being
given
is
comming
from
the
very
agency
that
was
embarrased
by
the
bdbranch
davidians
sp
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
make
the
bds
as
fanatical
and
dangerous
as
possible
if
they
were
portrayed
as
lawabiding
citizens
then
theyatf
had
no
justification
what
so
ever
of
doing
what
they
did
so
lets
keep
an
open
mind
jokes
like
above
even
though
it
may
be
funny
may
mislead
the
public
from
the
truth
of
the
matter
just
as
an
aside
my
understanding
of
us
vs
rock
island
and
us
vs
dalton
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
national
firearms
act
which
allows
the
feds
in
this
case
atf
to
regulate
firearmsmachine
guns
has
been
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
since
two
federal
district
courts
at
least
and
since
i
believe
the
only
reason
atf
was
involved
in
this
case
is
because
of
firearms
violations
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
search
warrent
was
based
on
the
nfa
it
would
be
very
embarrassing
indeed
if
a
search
warrent
based
on
a
possibly
unconstitutional
law
has
resulted
in
deathslaw
enforcement
the
above
opinions
are
mine

only
im
solely

for
my

if

i

there
are
significant

between

the

half
of
the

is
trust
similar

have

wonder
and
if
clinton
and
friends
have
their
way
highly
likely
at
this
point
the
new
order
government
will
also
have
all
the
guns
so
what
if
is
going
to
be
ten
years
late
i
think
we
are
going
to
discover
that
we
will
be
paying
dearly
for
putting
this
fellow
in
office
for
decades
to
come
even
some
diehard
supporters
are
having
serious
doubts
about
their
savior
ahem
see
the
war
on
drugs
as
sponsored
by
the
bush
and
reagan
administrations
the
precedent
had
well
been
set
for
federal
agencies
to
step
on
more
than
a
few
of
what
people
consider
rights
i
wont
make
excuses
for
anyone
but
most
of
the
damage
had
been
done
before
clinton
even
entered
the

that
two
of

the

a
few
comments
on
the
atfs
botched
handling
of
this
case
attempting
to
storm
the
compound
in
broad
daylight
the
explanation
we
were
given
at
least
at
one
point
was
that
they
thought
the
cult
members
would
be
at
religious
services
my
only
comment
on
this
bit
of
idiocy
is
that
if
youre
going
to
operate
as
a
quasimilitary
unit
youd
better
understand
basic
military
tactics
one
cardinal
rule
is
that
only
a
fool
plans
an
operation
where
if
one
assumption
is
incorrect
the
operation
will
fail
disastrously
we
were
told
that
atf
got
four
agents
killed
because
they
were
outgunned
they
didnt
expect
such
heavy
resistance
when
questioned
about
why
such
an
overwhelming
militarystyle
assault
was
planned
we
were
told
that
it
was
because
the
cultists
were
thought
to
be
heavily
armed
can
you
say
contradictory
i
knew
you
could
the
batf
has
had
a
bad
reputation
for
years
as
a
bunch
of
arrogant
hotdoggers
i
was
talking
to
relatives
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
referred
to
them
as
a
bunch
of
crockett
and
tubbs
wannabes
im
more
than
ever
convinced
thats
right
on
target
an
anecdote
not
related
to
the
waco
fiasco
is
that
apparently
the
batf
screwed
up
some
of
the
evidence
in
the
world
trade
center
bombing
theres
now
an
excellent
chance
some
of
the
forensic
evidence
gathered
by
the
fbi
will
not
be
admissible
in
court
this
is
not
hearsay
i
was
told
this
by
a
relative
of
my
wifes
who
happens
to
be
an
fbi
agent
his
opinion
of
the
batf
was
ummm
well
lets
just
say
uncomplimentary
i
have
still
not
been
presented
with
one
iota
of
evidence
that
the
bds
had
any
of
the
alleged
illegal
weaponry
which
was
the
reason
for
the
raid
in
the
first
place
btw
were
still
hearing
this
justification
ag
reno
on
cnn
yesterday
made
references
to
this
issue
without
any
substantiation
she
also
waved
around
the
hes
a
child
abuser
and
we
heard
he
was
beating
the
children
flag
sigh
a
point
re
the
feds
in
general
their
handling
of
the
whole
siege
reflected
a
complete
lack
of
understanding
of
the
probable
thought
processes
of
the
cultists
ag
reno
said
they
pushed
the
button
because
they
were
afraid
a
mass
suicide
was
in
the
offing
my
only
comment
on
that
is
that
if
the
cultists
were
that
close
to
the
edge
what
the
hell
did
she
think
their
reaction
would
be
to
an
hourslong
assault
on
the
compound
where
holes
were
punched
in
the
walls
and
cs
gas
pumped
in
if
i
were
a
bd
id
expect
the
forces
of
the
godless
government
to
assault
me
at
any
time
in
that
light
whether
they
torched
themselves
or
drank
jim
jones
koolaid
is
irrelevant
also
look
at
how
the
siege
was
conducted
bright
lights
loud
rock
music
cutting
off
communications
and
other
contact
with
the
outside
all
measures
designed
to
make
the
bds
feel
more
and
more
isolated
and
threatened
this
might
have
been
a
great
strategy
if
they
were
dealing
with
criminals
as
it
was
it
looks
to
me
like
everything

the

maybe
not

some
of

do

lament

at

the
idea
that
citizens
had

above
those
of
the

was
not
that
common
but
was
explicit
in
the
writings
of
the

to
a
considerable
extent
englishmen
also
had
those
rights
yes
times

and
technology
changes
the
possibility
of
a

governments
enserfing
all
of
mankind
was
not
possible
until
quite
recently
in
the
feudal
system
the
lord
was
almost
as
restricted
as
the
serfs
so
having
the
people
enserf
themselves
does
not
make
anything
better
most
feudal
lords

even
most

did
not
mistreat

that

possibly
not
it
sure
didnt
take
it
very

though
i
was

and
it
only
took
like
a
little
over
minutes

burn
down
waco
is
a
city
of
about
people
the
population
temporarily
raised
to
about
people
when
all
the
feds
and
state
police
officers
arrived
i
tell
you
what
i
stayed
in
a
hotel
room
about
miles
from
the
bd
compound
around
weeks
ago
i
have
never
felt
more
paranoid
in
my
whole
life
there
were
at
least
state
police
in
the
hotel
the
claim
we
had
the
water
turned
off
so
the
fire
engines
had
to
bring
their
own
doesnt
hold
up
if
they
had
cut
off
the
water
they
surely
could
have
turned
it
back
on
just
as
quickly
they
just
didnt
want
to
there
were
some
scores
to
settle
message
to
anybody
else
is
very
clear
dont
fuck
with
us
we
will
do
you
in
not
that
i
am
one
to
believe
that
everything
that
the
government
tells
us
is
true
but
if
that
was
the
message
they
wanted
to
send
why
did
they
wait
days
i
think
the
message
would
be
better
sent
by
charging
in
there
right
away
not
waiting
for
days
and
pounding
them
with
sound
etc
a
bunch
of
dead
bd
members
are
not
going
to
be
so
able
to
tell
their
side
of
the
story
so
now
all
we
have
is
the
story
according
to
the
batf
and
fbi
also
mr
care

the
rights
of

clinton
or
his
administration
approved
this
action
fbi
said
washington
had
approved
it
they
fbi
said
the
gas
masks
used
by
the
bds
have
a
finite
life
and
were
close
to
running
out
why
couldnt
they
have
just
waited
well
there
are
people
supposedly
alive
they
can
tell
their
story
as
far
as
bill
clinton
is
concerned
dont
you
think
he
has
more
pressing
matters
to
attend
to
besides
some
small
group
of
people
in
texas
how
about
bosnia
now
theres
a
problem
why
couldnt
they
have
waited
they
waited
too
long
as
it
is
something
should
have
been
done
earlier
they
gov
is
trying
to
say
it
was
a
mass
suicide
in
the
past
they
had
expressed
this
was
a
real
possibility
but
now
they
decided
it
wasnt
a
possibility
so
they
could
go
on

at
the
time
now
this
means
that
the
public
and
media
will
forget
about
all
this
having
become
weary
of
it
this
has
already
happened
for
many
people
there
will
be
no
investigation
independent
or
otherwise
or
a
whitewash
very
much
a
possibility
there
will
be
no
unsealing
of
the
warrant
and
related
documents
what
anybody
will
know
about
this
incident
will
be
the
batf
version
with
the
way
our
government
is
i
wouldnt
doubt
it
the
batf
has
just
been
given
carte
blanche
for
further
abuses
with
the
effective
support
and
approval
of
the
administration
clinton
said
on
the
news
that
he
knew
about
what
was
happening
but
that
it
was
all
in
the
hands
of
the
fbi
that
is
if
you
choose
to
believe
the
media
there
will
be
more
abuses
with
no
concern
of
administration
censure
the
precident
has
been
established
that
the
feds
can
kill
in
quantity
to
achieve
their
aims
especially
if
the
target
is
excercising
their
rights
under
the
second
amendment
and
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
is
a
governmentdeclared
unnice
fellow
if
they
had
rocket
launchers
and
such
as
the
press
and
gov
claims
why
shouldnt
they
have
done
something
what
possible
use
would
a
religious
cult
have
for
a
rocket
launcher
also
is
child
abuse
covered

the

they

god

of

tense
well
maybe
i
am
overreacting
but
i
see
on
the
tv
as
i
am
typing
where
maybe
maybe
not
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
should
be
raised
about
this
incident
the
problem
is
who
will
do
it
and
be
heard
govt
spoksewoman
the
new
attorney
general
known
to
be
almost
rabid
about
private
ownership
of
guns
wants
to
ban
assault
guns
and
just
about
everything
else
is
saying
the
fbi
had
amazing
restraint
then
falls
back
into
the
official
goverenment
line
about
how
the
bd
were
guity
of
child
abuse
and
were
into
it
in
an
ongoing
basis
and
so
on
note
that
according
to
the
liberal
elite
giving
a
child
a
spanking
is
regarded
as
child
abuse
seriously
if
it
gets
known
the
state
can
take
your
child
away
from
you
if
you
spank
your
kid
she
also
is
saying
which
state
is
that
the
federal
government
or
an
individual
state
government
clinton
personally
approved
this
operation
she
told
him
it
was
appropriate
and
so
on
and
he
said
ok
do
it
somehow
i
am
not
surprised
the
people
must
know
who
is
boss
who
is
in
charge
and
it
is
obviouly
no
longer
the
people
it
seems
to
me
that
the
people
havent
been
in
charge
for
a
long
time
if
they
really
were
i
dont
think
the
government
would
be
doing
as
many
things
as
it
has
in
the
past
and
i
maintain
the
appropriate
response
as
far
as
this
raid
by
batf
is
concerned
regarding
child
abuse
is
so
what
batf
are
not
our
child
protective
services
police
yet
after
all
the
bd
had
been
tried
on
that
charge
before
and
found
not
guilty
the
govt
people
have
pretty
much
gone
silent
on
the
terrible
illegal
guns
bd
supposedly
has
and
stress
the
continued
child
abuse
apparantly
to
make
it
a
seem
as
sort
of
a
rescue
operation
figuring
everyone
hates
child
abusers
and
anything
is
ok
to
use
against
them
occasional
references
to
ammunition
possesed
by
the
bds
and
so
on
is
irrelevant
it
is
not
illegal
to
have
ammunition
yet
true
but
is
it
illegal
to
have
a
rocket
launcher
am
i
having
a
vain
hope
that
an
honest
investigation
will
occur
on
this
thing
or
will
it
simply
be
whitewashed
under
the
rug
and
business
as
usual
will
continue
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
in
the
new
order
who
will
be
given
the
official
title
of
thought
police
i
wonder
and
if
clinton
and
friends
have
their
way
highly
likely
at
this
point
the
new
order
government
will
also
have
all
the
guns
so
what
if
is
going
to
be
ten
years
late
i
think
we
are
going
to
discover
that
we
will
be
paying
dearly
for
putting
this
fellow
in
office
for
decades
to
come
even
some
diehard
supporters
are
having
serious
doubts
about
their
savior
shit
if
people
dont
get
what
they
want
right
away
there
is
an
instant
problem
clinton
has
only
been
in
office
for
a
few
months
give
him
a
chance
to
get
something
done
the
guy
had
a
lot
of
shit
thrown
in
his
lap
in
the
beginning
give
him
a
chance
to
work
on
things
a
little
as
they
say
rome
wasnt
built
in

yes
i
am
upset
i
see
no

as
far
as

to
come
of
any
of

for
the

or
so

cnn
is
reporting
as
i
write
this
that
the
atf
has
ignited
all
the
buildings
of
the
branch
dividian
ranch
near
waco
tx
the
lies
from
atf
say
holes
were
made
in

walls
and
nonlethal

pumped
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
started
the
whole
thing
went
up
all
buildings
are
aflame
no
one
has
escaped
i
think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
napalm
then
let
the
wood
stove
inside
ignite
it
well
actually
the
davidians
koreshians
started
the
fire
themselves
the
last
i
heard
around
est
eight
people
ran
out
into
the
feilds
surrounding
the
compound
all
were
captured
and
two
admitted
to
setting
the
fire
i
dont
buy
your
napalm
theory
at
all
although
it
would
have
made
a
great
commercial
for
my
sig

the

would
they
have
a

stove
burning

a
warm

napalm
is
more
of
a
gel
now
to
further
dispute
your
theory
the

gas
was
inserted
around

about

the

if

youre

at

aha
thats
the
part
that
makes
me
nervous
too
who
gets
to
decide
if
i
am
a

based
on
appearance
would
someone
feel
more
threatened
actions
determine
whether
someone
presents
a
threat
and
i
dont
carry
a
gun
so
much
for
people
cause
i
tend
to
fade
if
there
are
any
about
but
due
to
several
encounters
with
formerly
domestic
dogs
these
critters
aint
scared
of
folks
and
can
get
aggressive
on
staying
at
and
saw
someone
sitting
there
cleaning
his
gun
softly
i
backed
away
and
hiked
another
miles
to
get
out
of
there
ill
freely
admit
it
here
im
not
afraid
of
guns
im
afraid
of
people
that
bring
them
into
the
backcountry
id
count
that
as
a
fear
of
guns
somebody
having
the
sense
to
keep
their
weapons
maintained
isnt
as
likely
to
present
a
threat
the
army
taught
me
to
clean
any
weapons
daily
since
they
usually
need
it
regardless
of
whether
theyve
been
used
youd
be
amazed
how
sweaty
a
holster
can
get
or
how
much
trail
dust
will
get
in
it
and
i
guess
youd
be
scared
of
me
and
my
former
explorer
post
seems
the
advisors
were
national
guard
special
forces
grunts
and
considered
it
heresy
to
be
out
in
the
woods
without
a
weapon
course
usually
you
wouldnt
notice
em
they
tended
to
avoid
public
scrutiny
of
course
that
may
be
the
way
to
solve
the
solitude
problem
just
carry
a
gun
and
display
it
prominently
and
one
probably
wont
see
most
of
the
other

out

who
will

might
have
accidentaly
started
the

the
buildings
of
the

near

the

from

holes
were
made

and
nonlethal
tear

pumped
in
a

after
this

the
whole

went
up
from
my
understanding
of
the
cnn
report
it
was
hours
after
they
started
all
buildings
are
aflame
no
one
has
escaped
i
think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
the
track
vehicle
that
i
saw
in
the

of
the
building
where
fire
was
first
noticed
looked
more
like
an

for

koresh

some

may

i
wouldnt

prosecuting
him
for
those

however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children

other
noncombatants
i

they
couldnt
just
leave

token
guard
on

wait

approve
of

if
it
caused

the

agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in

some

weird

everyone
knows
how
to
tell
when
a
politician
is
lying
his
lips
move
what
may
not
be
equally
obvious
is
that
there
are
politicians
and
then
there
are
politicians
and
that
the
phrase
political
science
is
subject
to
more
than
one
interpretation
years
ago
we
heard
how
scientists
were
worried
that
a
new
ice
age
might
be
coming
and
later
on
that
nuclear
winter
smoke
and
dust
thrown
into
the
atmosphere
by
fullscale
international
unpleasantness
was
a
possibility
something
like
that
may
even
have
killed
the
dinosaurs
what
we
didnt
hear
was
that
no
actual
data
supported
any
of
this
that
realworld
events
the
burning
of
kuwaiti
oil
fields
tended
to
discredit
it
that
mostly
it
was
propaganda
meant
to
weaken
values
that
made
america
the
most
successful
culture
in
history
and
that
the
dinosaurs
probably
died
of
something
like
the
plague
when
continents
drifted
together
exposing
them
to
new
germs
we
miss
a
lot
like
this
unless
we
listen
closely

famous

spill
and
mount
st

werent
supposed
to
recover
from
their

for

years
that
turned
out
not
to
be
true
although
youd
never
know
it
from
watching
network
nightly
news
or
cnn
it
doesnt
fit
their
agenda
to
inform
us
that
the
earth
is
vast
and
resilient
and
that
nature
is
rougher
on
herself
than
we
could
ever
be
but
for
once
the
media
arent
entirely
to
blame
as
ignorant
of
science
as
they
are
of
everything
they
trust
scientists
to
unscrew
the
inscrutable
the
trouble
is
that
todays
scientists
have
agendas
of
their
own
nobody
in
government
that
wellspring
of
scientific
wherewithal
is
going
to
offer
grants
to
an
investigator
who
states
truthfully
that
there
is
no
respectable
evidence
for
global

the
money

bureaucrats

as

of
the
mythical

as
a

of
privacy
and
freedom
they
find
intolerable
the
same
appears
true
of
acid

a
deliberate
hoax
cooked
up
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
hates
private
industrial
capitalism
almost
as
much
as
it
does

foisted
on
real

through
trickery
which
has
depended
on
specialists
in

not
talking

the
list
goes
on
always
with
a
common
disreputable
thread
ozone
depletion
for
which
evidence
is
even
more
suspect
and
contradictory
than
for
acid
rain
or
global
warming
is
no
more
than
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
indict
private
capitalism
in
an
era
when
state
central
planning
and
the
command
economy
have
failed
and
can
only
find
this
final
withered
leg
to
teeter
on
decades
of
antinuclear
alarmism
resting
on
foundations
of
myth
and
panicmongering
have
failed
to
erase
the
fact
that
nuclear
power
is
the
safest
cleanest
most
efficient
source
of
energy
known
to
mankind
and
more
to
the
point
that
the

of

there
is
available
to
any

in

individual

on
the

of

gun
ownership
and

on

conducted
by

who
began
as
ideological
opponents
to
those
concepts
but
which
show
massive
reductions
in
the
latter
to
be
the
result
of
the
former
have
been
suppressed
most
recently
by
the
california
state
government
and
what
the
media
didnt
say
about
recent
epa
discoveries
on
the
effect
of
secondhand
smoking
is
that
although
some
harm
to
non
smokers
may
have
been
detected
it
was
less
by
an
order
or
two
of
magnitude
than
that
associated
with
frying
bacon
a
couple
times
a
week
or
keeping
a
pet
bird
its
enough
to
make
you
wonder
whether
there
was
ever
anything
to
the
claim
that
smoking
causes
cancer
that
of
course
is
the
real
threat
represented
by
politically
correct
science
the
world
is
a
dangerous
place
it
would
be
nice
to
know
the
hazards
ive
never
believed
smoking
to
be
a
healthy
practice
but
given
a
lack
of
credibility
on
the
part
of
todays
science
how
am
i
to
decide
what
to
do
about
it
nicotine
is
highly
addictive
to
that
much
i
can
attest
from
experience
yet
the
stress
of
quitting
may
be
riskier
than
to
continue
there
isnt
any
way
to
tell
thanks
to
the
corrupting
influence
of
government
money
on
the
scientific
establishment
two
centuries
ago
the
founding
fathers
spared
us
certain
agonies
to
which
every
other
nation
in
the
world
has
been
subject
at
one
time
or
another
by
creating
a
legal
barrier
between
politics
and
religion
each
time
some
shortsighted
individual
or
group
has
tried
to
lower
the

real
human
blood
is
being
shed
over
scientific
issues
as
peoples
lives
are
ruined
through
the
loss
to
agencies
like
the
epa
of
livelihood
or
property
it
may
have
taken
a
lifetime
to
accumulate
to
diseases
caused
by
toxins
associated
with
burning
fossil
fuels
for
electrical
power
or
thanks
to
bans
on
things
like
cyclamates
when
they
die
from
the
effects
of
obesity
what
we
need
now
if
we
hope
to
survive
as
a
civilization
for
two
more
centuries
is
another
barrier
a
constitutional
separation
of

psyops
because
ive
found
some
of
the
techniques
to
be
useful
in
business
negotiations
that
puts
me
firmly
in
the
amateur
ranks
this
amateur
knows
that
the
first
thing
to
do
when
sizing
up
the
opponent
is
to
do
a
psychological
profile
on
him
you
can
bet
your
ass
the
fbi
had
professionally
done
profiles
on
koresh
koreshs
behavior
was
emminently
predictable
it
is
typical
of
people
who
move
away
from
civilization
to
be
willing
to
fight
to
the
death
to
preserve
their
isolation
it
would
also
be
typical
given
koreshs
religious
orientation
for
such
an
individual
to
interpret
a
government
assault
as
the
apocalypse
suicide
is
as
an
acceptable
alternative
to
being
consumed
in
the
apocalypse
imho
the
fbi
knew
all
this
and
decided
after
days
of
concentrated
psyops
to
initiate
that
apocalypse
i
believe
they
chose
a
course
of
action
designed
specifically
to
push
koresh
over
the
edge
while
publicly
appearing
to
be
acting
reasonably
they
knew
that
koresh
considered
the
tanks
to
be
the
chariots
of
fire
mentioned
in
the
book
of
revelations
they
knew
that
sending
tanks
oops
combat
engineering
vehicles
obstensibly
to
perform
gas
insertions
love
that
newspeak
would
push
him
over
the
edge
look
at
some
supporting
evidence
koreshs
attorney
mentioned
on
tv
earlier
today
that
one
of
koreshs
major
concern
was
the
biblical
role
of
the
tanks
stationed
around
the
compound
the
fbi
through
reno
on
larry
king
last
night
and
at
the
news
conference
this
morning
claimed
to
have
listening
devices
in
the
compound
if
that
was
true
they
knew
their
actions
were
driving
him
to
the
brink
they
knew
they
were
pushing
the
davidians
toward
mass
suicide
any
rational
and
reasonable
agency
not
interested
in
killing
those
people
would
at
the
first
sign
of
preparations
for
suicide
have
pulled
completely
back
and
would
have
gotten
rid
of
all
the
armor
instead
they
continued
with
the
gas
insertion
right
up
to
the
point
where
flames
appeared
the
image
that
will
remain
etched
in
my
mind
is
that
of
the
tank
strutting
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
burning
compound
gloating
over
the
kill
lets
step
back
and
assess
how
this
thing
could
have
been
ended
without
bloodshed
this
technique
would
have
required
a
law
enforcement
agency
interested
in
constitutionally
enforcing
the
law
and
in
the
preservation
of
life
instead
of
achieving
a
military
victory
and
of
vengence
the
way
to
have
nabbed
koresh
was
simply
to
have
announced
a
pull
back
abandoned
the
assault
torn
down
the
concertina
wire
and
removed
the
armor
maintained
covert
surveillance
of
the
compound
and
then
exploited
his
ego
to
flush
him
out
exploiting
his
ego
would
have
been
simple
a
simple
invite
or
two
from
the
tabloid
talk
shows
to
come
on
tv
and
tell
how
he
whipped
the
us
government
would
have
been
something
he
could
not
have
resisted
he
could
have
then
been
nabbed
when
he
left
the
compound
simple
clean
and
safe
but
because
it
would
have
required
the
fbi
to
execute
a
tactical
retreat
and
would
have
deprived
them
of
the
revenge
they
sought
it
was
totally
out
of
the

my

not

you

if

set

started

spread
very

then
they
got

heres
how

the

id
be

koresh
and
his
people
were
basically
minding
their
own
business
some
weapons
violations
may
have
been
committed
and
i
wouldnt
have
disapproved
of
prosecuting
him
for
those
violations
however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children
and
other
noncombatants
i
dont
see
they
couldnt
just
leave
a
token
guard
on
the
place
and
wait
the
bds
out
i
dont
approve
of
the
tear
gas
approach
and
if
it
caused
the
fire
to
be
started
i
think
the
fbi
agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in
jail
i
think
the
legal
term
would
be
negligent
homicide
however
if
koreshs
response
to
the
tear
gas
was
to
kill
everyone
there
i
hold
him
largely
responsible
for
their
deaths
well
its
nice
to
see
someone
with
a

a
general
lack
of
paranoia

over

tobacco

batf
in

in
your

you
stated
that

underscore
the
need

legislation
to
keep
guns
out

my

what
grounds
would

best
i
can
tell
this
statement
underscores
your
apparent
total
ignorance
of
the
subject
and
highlights
your
personal
bias
against
firearms
i
say
this
because
there
are
only
two
possible
paths
of
gun
control
which
you
could
have
been
referencing
either
you
were
talking
about
their
access

in

i
should
point
out
that

have
never
been

any

these

the
fact
they
they
live

was
the
fifth

of
the
trial
synopsis
government
informant
kenneth
fadeley
testified
that
randy
weaver
sold
him
two
shotguns
in
violation
of
the
national

act
of
us
district
court
judge
edward
lodge
asks
jurors
not
to
hear
accounts
of
the
waco
fire
because
of
possible
influences
on
the
weaverharris
case
the
testimony
of
fbi
special
agent
greg
rampton
apparently
ended
without
further
incident
as
it
was
mentioned
neither
by
ktvb
nor
the
idaho
statesman
the
day
was
highlighted
by
the
testimony
of
kenneth
fadeley
who
had
been
posing
as
an
outlaw
biker
and
illegal
guns
person
named
gus
magiosono
fadeley
testified
that
he
was
acting
as
an
informant
for
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
in
his
dealings
with
randy
weaver
fadeley
began
by
stating
that
he
had
met
weaver
in
at
an
aryan
nations
summer
conference
in
hayden
lake
idaho
the
two
then
met
again
october
note
the
huge
separation
in
time
at
a
restaurant
in
sandpoint
idaho
to
begin
a
weapons
transaction
he
stated
that
weaver
had
said
he
felt
like
he
weaver
was
being
prepared
to
do
something
dangerous
for
the
white
cause
the
two
later
met
october
behind
the
restaurant
and
later
went
to
a
city
park
to
make
the
sale
during
this
second
meeting
fadeley
was
wearing
a
small
recording
device
to
tape
the
conversation
weaver
allegedly
showed
him
an
hr
gauge
shotgun
with
a
barrel
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
he
additionally
showed
a
remington
shotgun
with
a
barrel
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
nfa
requires
minimums
of
inches
for
barrel
length
and
an
overall
length
of
inches
on
tape
weaver
is
reported
to
have
said
that
he
could
perform
better
work
once
his
machine
shop
is
set
up
the
two
then
discuss
the
possibility
of
future
sales
fadeley
then
counts
out
three
hundred
dollars
for
the
two
guns
and
promises
the
balance
of
onehundred
fifty
dollars
when
they
next
meet
note
that
the
atf
could
have
simply
arrested
him
here
why
did
they
wait
until
january
over
a
year
later
to
arrest
him
this
is
not
explained
the
next
meeting
took
place
on
nov
fadeley
stated
that
his
source
had
only
come
up
with
one
hundred
dollars
instead
of
the
onehundred
fifty
hed
promised
at
this
point
weaver
suspected
he
was
dealing
with
an
informant
i
had
a
guy
in
spokane
tell
me
you
were
bad
fadeley
managed
to
convince
weaver
otherwise
the
idaho
statesman
states
explicitly
that
three
tapes
were
made
of
conversations
with
randy
weaver
thus
each
of
these
meetings
must
have
been
recorded
however
the
statesman
also
reported
that
a
tape
of
a
telephone
conversation
involving
vicki
weaver
randy
weavers
wife
was
played
to
the
court
there
must
have
also
been
phone
taps
these
tapes
were
played
to
the
court
via
both
headphones
and
loudspeakers
under
the
objections
of
gerry
spence
weavers
attorney
spence
said
to
a
ktvb
reporter
that
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
government
proved
its
case
if
it
has
a
case
at
all
according
to
the
rules
randy
weaver
tore
off
his
headphones
and
wept
when
he
heard
his
wifes
voice
on
the
tape
us
district
court
judge
edward
lodge
asked
jurors
not
to
hear
accounts
of
the
waco
fire
because
of
possible
influences
on
the
weaverharris
case
exactly
how
such
information
could
affect
this
trial
is
not
explained
other
notes
sunday
evening
there
was
a
report
on
ktvb
concerning
kevin
harris
unnamed
agents
within
the
fbi
admit
that
they
are
surprised
that
kevin
harris
is
still
alive
first
they
were
surprised
that
he
survived
the
initial
gunshot
wounds
sustained
in
the
initial
firefight
at
the
yjunction
later
when
randy
weaver
was
struck
by
sniper
fire
the
sniper
had
reported
that
harris
had
been
struck
not
weaver
finally
there
was
a
report
that
the
fbi
agent
who
killed
vicki
weaver
believed
he
was
aiming
at
kevin
harris
instead
this
is
what
was
reported
critics
are
charging
that
the
fbi
was
blatantly
trying
to
eliminate
the
only
nongovernment
witness
to
the
deaths
of
samuel
weaver
and
deputy
marshal
william
degan
some
local
people
believe
that
harriss
survival
is
simply
due
to
divine

what

they

needs
more

better

two

who
escaped
said
the

was

set

since
the

we

absolutely
no

verification
of
any
of
the
governments
claims
in
this
matter
moreover
the
batf
has
admitted
having
agents
in
the
compound
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
those
agents
were
still
in
the

when
the

shots
were

the

at

started
the
fbi
spokesman
has
been
stressing
how
unstable

paranoid
david
koresh
was
he
stressed
how
likely
it
was
the
the
branch
davidians
would
commit
mass
suicide
he
was
concerned
with
the
safety
of
the
children
what
did
the
fbi
do
to
defuse
the
situation
did
they
try
to
reassure
koresh
did
the
fbi
offer
medical
assistance
to
the
bd
did
the
fbi
offer
them
a
supply
of
water
when
the
bd
pump
stoped
working
did
the
permit
koresh
to
communicate
with
anyone
outside
the
compound
what
the
fbi
did
was
harass
the
branch
davidians
as
much
as
possible
they
kept
powerful
lights
shining
on
the
compound
shut
off
their
electrical
power
put
their
pump
out
of
action
assaulted
their
ears
with

noise
cut
off
their
communication
with
the
outside
and
kept
limiting

the
stated
goal
was
to
put
pressure
on
david

was
the
fbi
attempting
to
get

or
were
they
hoping

so
mad

some

would
attack
the
the

it
appears
that
the
tactics
employed
by
the

did
drive

the

the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would
of
had
the
proper
equipment
and
personal
then
they
could
of
captured
the
compound
on
the
initial
assault
and
none
of
this
would
of
happened
the
batf
needs
more
people
better
weapons
and
more
armored
transports
when
they
meet
hostile
fire
they
should
be
able
to
use
more
force
instead
of
retreating
to
a
stand
off
if
you
are
going
to
do
a
job
then
do
it
right
the
batf
is
there
to
protect
us
and
they
must
have
the
proper
equipment
and
people
to
do
the
job
with
the
wod
and
the
increased
crime
in
the
streets
the
batf
is
needed
more
now
then
ever
if
they
blast
away
a
few
good
fokes
then
that
is
the
price
we
all
have
to
pay
for
law

order
in
this
country
look

all
the
good
people
that
died
in
wars
to
protect
this
great
country
of
ours
with
the
arms
build
up
in
waco
they
needed
to
hit
that
compound
with
mega
fire
power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a

would

been

i

this

careful

we
all
thought
that
todays

out

result
in
the
peaceful
resolution

at

meaningful
negotiation
instead
we
are
faced

devastation

death
however
i
have
no

that
our
plan
was
correct
and
was
conducted
with
extreme
professionalism

i
applaud

shown

murder
most
foul
cnn
is
reporting
as
i
write
this
that
the
atf
has
ignited
all
the
buildings
of
the
branch
dividian
ranch
near
waco
tx
the
lies
from
atf
say
holes
were
made
in
the
walls
and
nonlethal
tear
gas
pumped
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
started
the
whole
thing
went
up
all
buildings
are
aflame
no
one
has
escaped
i
think
it
obvious
that
the
atf
used
armored
flamethrower
vehicles
to
pump
in
unlit
napalm
then
let
the
wood
stove
inside
ignite
it
actually
if
a
few
minutes
translates
into
hours
you
have
it
right
but
you
and
i
guess
your
singlesource
news
agency
cnn
failed
to
mention
the
davidians
pouring
kerosene
all
over
and
lighting
it
in
plain
view
this
is
murder
well
smallscale
jim
jones
type
suicide
with
fire
instead
of
koolaid
atf
murderers
butchers
sorry
guy
you
got
it
wrong
atf
was
pumping
tear
gas
into
the
compound
the
branch
davidians
going
along
with
their
apocolyptic
faith
set
their
own
compound
on
fire
killing
all
but
or
so
no
children
survived
this
is
genocidal
massslaughter
of
innocent
people
including
children
selfslaughter
anyway
i
pity
the
children
who
were
to
young
to
be
able
to
make
a
conscious
choice
i
have
predicted
this
from
the
start
but
god
it
sickens
me
to
see
it
happen
i
had
hoped
i
was
wrong
i
had
hoped
that
there
was
still
some
shred
of
the
america
i
grew
up
with

loved
left
alive
i
was
wrong
the

have
won
you

it

if
it

in

i
supported
gun

before
i
did

theres
no

for

people
who
dont

what
theyre
talking
about
in

theyd
be
much
better
off
if
they
didnt

anything
and
why
is
this

even
if
a
progun
person
doesnt
know
what
they
are
talking
about
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
they
will
learn
a
thing
or
two
i
am
and
will
continue
to
post
even
if
people
get
angry
with
what
i
have
to
say
i
have
several
good

of
material
now
that
i
know
where
to
look
so
calm
down
theres
lots
of
information
flowing
on

for
those
interested
in
learning
one
can
participate
in
those

without

inaccurately
failure
to
do
so
has
consequences
ah
freeman
seems
to
forget
from
my

that
i
am
learning
i
have
also
asked
several
of
the
notsohostile
folks
on
this
group
for
sources
of
information
to
read
do
you
think
freeman
that
maybe
this
means
i
am
interested
in
learning
i
think
it
does
because
as
you
said
people
who
dont
know
anything
wont
be
good
for
the
progun
cause
another
good
habit
to
get
into
is
to
go
readonly
for
a
while
to
take
the
time
to
figure
out
how
things
work
another
good
habit
to
get
into
is
to
realize
that
not
everyone
is
you
freeman
and
accept
mistakes
sure
maybe
it
could
have
been
some
type
of
misinformation
being
slung
by
some
antigun
nut
but
it
wasnt
i
made
my
statement
to
inform
everyone
of
this
and
everyone
who
replied
said
dont
worry
about
it
but
also
to
learn
as
much
as
you
can
they
accepted
my
mistake
and
gave
me
sources
of
information
and
told
me
to
read
as
much
as
possible
i
have
read

badly
two

its
a
story
about
arizona
househunting
from
leslie
fish
musician
and
author
one
of
the
reasons
im
planning
to
move
to
arizona
is
that
despite
its
lousy
economy
race
problems
simmering
religious
problems
and
hopelessly
bad
government
arizona
has
one
of
the
lowest
violent
crime
rates
in
the
country
is
it
just
coincidence
that
arizona
is
also
one
of
the
few
remaining
nogun
control
states
in
the
country
well
consider
this
funny
story
last
time
i
was
in
phoenix
staying
with
liz
burnham
i
did
some
checking
on
the
local
realestate
market
thats
when
i
discovered
that
with
my
income
as
provable
by
my
tax
returns
i
can
qualify
for
every
lowincome
housing
loan
in
the
book
with
the
exception
of
va
and
i
came
across
an
astonishing
ad
in
the
local
marketpaper
it
offered
a
threebedroom
house
in
the
phoenix
area
for
are
you
ready
for
this
all
of
no
money
down
per
month
total
payments
christ
on
a
harleydavidson
i
called
up
the
realestate
office
making
this
offer
made
it
clear
that
i
was
only
checking
the
local
market
and
asked
about
that
house
were
the
walls
roof
and
foundation
structurally
sound
yes
were
the
plumbing
and
electrical
systems
functional
and
up
to
code
yes
did
the
airconditioning
system
an
absolute
necessity
in
phoenix
work
yes
again
okay
so
what
was
wrong
with
the
house
well
it
needed
lots
of
plastering
painting
yard
work
and
some
patching
of
the
roof
and
yes
lowinterest
repair
loans
were
available
okay
sez
i
if
thats
all
thats
wrong
with
it
just
why
are
you
selling
a
house
for
all
of
well
squirms
the
agent
its
in
kind
of
a
bad
neighborhood
how
bad
sez
i
remembering
some
of
the
neighborhoods
ive
seen
in
chicago
and
oakland
worst
in
the
city
the
agent
sighs
and
then
he
told
me
this
amazing
story
every
few
years
it
seems
the
big
vicegangs
in
los
angeles
notice
that
theres
no
gang
presence
in
phoenix
which
is
just
a
quick
drive
from
la
and
get
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
subsidiary
there
well
a
couple
years
ago
the
colonizing
force
came
to
this
neighborhood
it
being
poor
and
spanish
they
figured
they
could
move
right
in
and
take
over
bought
this
house
and
started
operations
unfortunately
for
them
the
neighbors
not
only
didnt
like
this
they
didnt
care
for
whores
trotting
up
and
down
their
streets
all
night
pimps
soliciting
their
kids
dope
deals
on
the
corners
in
broad
daylight
and
so
on
they
werent
afraid
to
do
something
about
it
the
neighbors
called
the
cops
for
some
reason
the
phoenix
police
are
remarkably
honest
capable
polite
and
prompt
and
the
cops
promptly
came
and
swept
up
all
the
whores
pimps
and
pushers
off
the
street
and
away
to
jail
the
remaining
gang
members
decided
to
retaliate
in
the
fashion
they
usually
use
in
la
they
got
the
complainants
name
and
address
off
the
court
records
and
did
a
driveby
shooting
at
his
house
well
this
wasnt
los
angeles
the
moment
the
neighbors
heard
the
first
gunshots
fired
they
all
ran
out
their
front
doors
with
their
own
guns
rifles
shotguns
pistols
everything
and
shot
back
the
car
didnt
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
block
it
coasted
to
a
stop
riddled
with
more
holes
than
the
famous
bonnie
and
clyde
getaway
car
which
ive
seen
its
on
display
in
a
casino
in
a
casino
in
las
vegas
the
gas
tank
and
fuel
lines
had
been
ruptured
so
the
car
caught
fire
the
neighbors
waited
a
good
minutes
making
sure
nobody
got
out
of
that
car
before
they
called
the
fire
department
to
come
put
out
the
fire
and
tow
the
wreck
away
by
that
time
the
asphalt
under
the
car
had
melted
and
caught
fire
too
which
subsequently
left
a
large
and
nasty
pothole
in
the
street
the
city
is
slow
about
repairing
small
streets
so
the
hole
stayed
there
providing
a
traffic
hazard
for
several
months
all
this
was
two
years
ago
the
agent
concluded
and
theres
been
no
trouble
since
but
the
house
and
the
neighborhood
still
have
a
bad
reputation
and
thats
why
the
house
was
so
cheap
hearing
this
story
i
nearly
laughed
my
ass
off
i
told
the
agent
that
if
i
had
the
money
at
the
moment
id
bygod
buy
the
house
this
was
nothing
compared
to
bad
neighborhoods
id
seen
here
in
california
where
driveby
shootings
go
unchecked
by
the
wellarmed
cops
let
alone
by
the
unarmed
neighbors
if
thats
the
absolute
worst
youll
find
in
phoenix
then
thats
the
city
for
me
thats
the

where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter

alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
it
certainly
is
provable
around
a
million
americans
every
year
defend
themselves
with
firearms
in
many
of
these
cases
the
defender
doesnt
even
have
to
fire
a
shot
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
is
oftentimes
all
the
deterrent
that
is
needed
i
dont

anymore
than
anyone
else
does

taking
away
the
right
of
americans

not

solution
to

problem
in

if
honest
lawabiding

expect

syndicates
who

into

start

believe
me
this

there
is
plenty

economic
incentive

to
illegaly
import

the

never

its

which
includes
cases
in

are
shot

not

and
cases
in
which
the

vs

criminal

homicides

it

to

in

the

will

turn

whereas
in

may

i
have
been
at

where

were
practicing

how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
there
are
many
many
bad
things
going
on
in
that
area
also
i
have
several
friends
that
live
very
close
to
that
area
who
have
had
problems
with
some
of
these
folks
by
the
way
where
did
i
say
that
they
were

that
was
what
i
got
from
your
phrasing
too
well
then
were
they
the
ones
you
saw
black
you
dont

seem
to
deny
it
either
do
you
think
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
that
is
the
recommended
way
to
practice
with
a
ccw
too
aim
alone
is
no
good
for
defense
if
you
cant
get
the
gun
rapidly
if
you
would
have
been
there
andy
it
wouldve
been
obvious
to
you
too
what
outside
of
prejudice
would
have
made
it
obvious
of
course
it
might
not
have
been
who
knows
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
was
there
i
live
here
and
i
know
that
they
were
gang
bangers
when
you
live
here
long
enough
it
becomes
pretty
easy
to
spot
them
via
gang
colors
gang
signs

yes
prejudice
is
more
subtle
in

isnt
it

my

a

she
makes
it

because
it

she
is

to
respond
to

quite
effectively
i
wasnt

ive
heard
those
descriptions
if
youre
paying
attention
ive
mentioned
that
i
saw
the

with
my

but
the
main
gun
firing
was
an
account
i
heard
that
helps
people
judge
whether
or
not
to
kick
in
the
to
use
your
words
bullshit
filters
stating
that
i
claimed
this
is
a
falsehood
later
in
the
same
post
another
part
of
my
memories
was
that
while
most
damaged
building
were
burnt
some
were
in
rubble
based
on
what
i
remember
i
was
and
am
inclined
to
believe
an
old
sarge
or
two
fine
now
you
are
stating
that
you
believe
their
claims
or
that
you
are
inclined
to
see
below
for
a
stronger
statement
of
your
beliefs
those
claims
are
still
ludicrous
however
previously
awesley
had
written
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
prompting
me
to
write
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
to
which
awesley
replied
john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel
youre
losing
it
so
you
have
to
stretch
what
i
said
and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
but
why
did
you
mention
grenade
launchers
at
all
because
it
supports
the
notion
that
the
tanks
shelled
buildings
and
it
supports
that
notion
because
it
conjures
images
of
troops
launching
fragmentary
grenades
but
that
too
is
ludicrous
i
wrote
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
awesley
relied
glad
to
know
youre
such
an
expert
nice
to
hear
some
an
authority
i
especially
appreciate
your
basis
of
knowledge
if
it
had
happened
you
would
have
know
it
since
you
are
such
an
authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
yes
if
it
happened
i
would
have
heard
about
it
everybody
would
have
army
tanks
dont
fire
their
cannons
in
american
cities
in
the
without
it
becoming
common
knowledge
without
minority
leaders
seizing
on
it
and
condemning
it
over
and
over
again
without
civil
libertarians
saying
this
has
gone
far
enough
so
yes
my
never
hearing
of
it
was
the
basis
for
my
disbelieving
the
claim
now
i
have
more
reasons
to
disbelieve
it
not
one
poster
has
written
to
say
yes
i
lived
in
detroit
at
that
time
and
everybody
knew
that
the
tanks
had
fired
shells
this
is
the
usenet
if
it
had
happened
somebody
here
would
remember
it
furthermore
your
own
research
failed
to
come
up
with
any
support
for
the
claim
the
claim
is
extraordinary
and
it
has
no
supporting
evidence
extraordinary
or
not
unless
you
count
the
brags
of
a
couple
of
guardsmen
shooting
the
shit
i
do
not
i
wrote
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
awesley
wrote
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
quibble
fine
it
was
an
army
coverup
six
years
in
the
reserves
has
taught
me
the
difference
also
but
do
you
think
that
in
two
and
half
decades
not
one
guiltridden
participant
has
come
forward
and
said
yes
i
shelled
americans
or
i
gave
the
orders
to
fire
the
cannons
or
i
helped
cover
it
up
i
wrote
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
awesley
replied
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
did
fire
their
guns
good
then
we
can
drop
the
junk
about
you
not
claiming

they
did
your
belief
fails
a
basic

check
why
isnt

then

bored

charles
scripter
writes
this
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
is
what
confuses
me
according
to
the
federalist
papers
a
well
regulated
militia
has
a
well
defined
structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
perhaps
you
should
reread
federal
which
deals
exclusively
with
the
well
regulated
malitia
here
is
what
is
says
about
its
character
to
oblige
the
great
body
of
the
yeomanry
and
of
the
other
classes
of
the
citizens
to
be
under
arms
for
the
purpose
of
going
through
military
exercises
and
evolutions
as
often
as
might
be
necessary
to
acquire
the
degree
of
perfection
which
would
entitle
them
to
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
it
also
talks
about
the
well
regulated
militia
having
a
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
i
will
note
you
did
quote
the
end
of
this
particular
paragraph
which
states
little
more
can
reasonably
be
aimed
at
with
respect
to
the
people
at
large
than
to
have
them
properly
armed
and
equipped
and
in
order
to
see
that
this
be
not
neglected
it
will
be
necessary
to
assemble
them
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
a
year
but
do
you
knew
how
much
organization
is
required
to
training
a
large
group
of
poeple
twice
a
year
just
to
try
to
get
the
same
people
every
year
provide
a
basic
training
to
new
people
so
they
can
be
integrated
into
the
force
and
find
a
suitable
location
it
requires
a
continually
standing
committee
of
organizers
since
a
well
regulate
militia
is
nationally
uniform
in
structure
and
disipline
and
meet
once
or
twice
a
year
to
train
how
can
you
claim
a
well
regulated
militia
is
not
well
organized
but
i
will
concide
a
well
organized
militia
is
not
necessarily
a
well
regulated
militia
several
people
have
stated
that
the
well
organized
militia
is
what
is
defined
under
usc
which
states
the
militia
of
the
united
states
consists
of
all
ablebodied
males
at
least
years
of
age
and
except
as
provided
in
section
of
title
under
years
of
age
who
are
or
who
have
made
a
declaration
of
intention
to
become
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
female
citizents
of
the
united
states
who
are
commissioned
officers
of
the
national
guard
this
deos
define
the
militia
but
were
is
the
adjective
well
regulated
usc
does
not
define
a
well
regualed
militia
in
any
way
shape
or
form
it
only
defines
who
can
become
part
of
a
well
regulated
militia
the
federalist
papers
clearly
define
the
well
regualed
militia
as
a
proper
subset
of
the
militia
in
the
same
paragraph
quoted
above
it
talk
above
disciplining
all
the
militia
of
the
united
states
so
they
fit
the
character
of
a
wellregulated
militia
this
is
what
the
paragraph
states
about
the
associated
costs
it
would
form
an
annual
deduction
from
the
productive
labor
of
the
country
to
an
amount
which
calculating
upon
the
present
numbers
of
the
people
would
not
fall
far
short
of
the
whole
expense
of
the
civil
establishments
of
all
the
states
to
attempt
a
thing
which
would
abridge
the
mass
of
labor
and
industry
to
so
considerable
an
extent
would
be
unwise
and
the
experiment
if
made
could
not
succeed
because
it
would
not
long
be
endured
another
quote
provide
by
charles
scripter
is
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
so
the
phrase
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
must
either
qualify
or
explain
the
phrase
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
definition
of
explain
as
stated
in
the
american
hertitage
dictionary
of
the
enlish
language
the
new
college
edition
is
to
make
plain
or
comprehensible
remove
obscruity
from
elucidate
it
was
the
economists
who
undertook
to
explain
this
puzzle
to
define
explicate
expound
he
explained
his
plan
to
offer
reasons
for
or
a
cause
of
an
answer
for
justify
explain
an
error
the
second
phrase
clearly
does
not
explain
the
first
therefore
the
second
phrase
must
qualify
the
first
the
definition
given
for
qualify
is
to
describe
by
enumerating
the
characteristics
or
qualities
of
characterize
to
make
competent
or
suitable
for
office
position
or
task
to
give
legal
power
to
make
legally
capable
to
modify
limit
or
restrict
as
giving
exceptions
to
make
less
harsh
or
severe
moderate
grammar
to
modify
the
meaning
of
a
word
or
phrase
since
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
does
not
describe
modify
or
make
less
harsh
anything
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
grammar
or
some
sort
of
position
or
task
by
process
of
elimination
it
must
fall
into
definition
and
since
deals
with
legal
power
the
same
thing
the
constitution
does
it
must
be
the
correct
definition
in
this
case
therefore
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
gives
legal
power
to
the
well
regualated
militia
and
this
legal
power
shall
not
be
infringed
i
thank
you
very
much
mr
scripter
you
have
provided
me
with
more
evidence
that
the
second
amendment
only
concerns
itseft
with
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulate
militia
and
says
very
little
about
the
right
of
an
untrained
person
to
keep
and
bear
a
caliber
machine
gun
and
since
i
totally
untrained
in
the
use
of
any
firearm
something
i
personly
have
meant
to
correct
by
going
to
a
nra
gun
safety
course
and
joining
a
gun
club
cannot
legally
buy
such
a
machine
gun
i
conclude
the
courts
and
democraticly
elected
congress
agree
with
me
so
now
we
know
which
category
mr
rutledge
is
in
he
means
to
destroy
our
liberties
and

i
mean
to
destory
our

is
that
why
a

in

exactly
what
our

i
force
my
version
of
our
liberties
and

by
begining
statements
of
what
our
liberties
and
rights
with
all
that
the
second

clearly
states
to
me
using
expressions
such
as
states
to
me
clearly
mean
i

my

i
dont
think
so
so
in
effort
not
to

my

and
not
to
destory
our

and

i
state
that
nothing
i
have

write
in
the
matter
of
liberties
and
rights
is
the

that

no
they
noted
that
no

had
claimed
that
it
was
a

despite
having
been

in
at

two

this
was
true
since
neither

did
they
or
did

the

was

altered

therefore
us

supports

that

from

a
couple
of
questions
for
you
firearms
law
experts
out
there
question
according
to
the
nraila
state
firearms
lawbook
in
wisconsin
it
is
unlawful
for
any
person
except
a
peace
officer
to
go
armed
with
a
concealed
and
dangerous
weapon
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
obtaining
a
lixense
or
permit
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
jury
instructions
indicate
that
to
go
armed
one
must
have
a
firearm
on
ones
person
or
within
his
immediate
control
and
available
for
use
does
this
mean
that
open
carry
is
allowed
if
so
just
how
open
does
it
have
to
be
would
an
in
the
pants
holster
be
considered
concealing
what
if
one
had
their
jacket
on
and
it
partially
covered
the
weapon
also
is
there
any
way
to
be
allowed
to
carry
concealed
or
is
it
just
not
allowed
period
question
as
i
understand
it
in
evanston
il
they
have
a
ordinance
banning
handguns
is
there
any
way
to
get
around
this
provision
what
would
the
penalty
if
you
were
found
out
be
what
if
you
used
said
handgun
in
a
defensive
shooting
in
your
apartment
there
how
would
the
city
law
apply
to
your
impending
trial
for
the
shooting
also
what
is
il
state
law
concerning
short
barreled
weapons
short
barreled
shotgun
is
what
i
would
be
interested
in
if
a
handgun
were
not
available
either
that
or
a
shortened
carbine
ie
colt
marlin
one
more
thing
what
is
the
chance
of
getting
a

in
il
without
being

as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
subject
re
some
more
about
gun
control
first
i
would
like
to
say
how
much
i
appreciate
having
so
literate
and
erudite
an
individual
as
mr
rutledge
with
whom
to
discuss
this
topic
frankly
most
antirkba
posters
refuse
even
to
approach
the
topic
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
detailed
in
the
writings
of
the
era
this
is
most
refreshing
second
i
must
apologize
for
leaving
the
discussion
for
several
days
my
brigades
quarterly
drill
was
this
weekend
and
i
needed
to
attend
to
several
matters
pertaining
to
the
state
militia
some
people
seem
to
feel
that
the
concept
of
the
militia
is
an
anachro
nism
that
is
out
of
place
in
the
century
im
not
sure
the
swiss
would
agree
and
i
think
perhaps
a
discussion
of
how
the
militia
both
organized
and
unorganized
fits
into
the
defense
plans
of
my
state
mississippi
please
do
not
assume
that
this
describes
something
peculiar
to
one
southern
state
for
instance
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
a
well
organized
militia
which
members
report
maintains
stocks
of
both
riot
guns
and
machine
guns
the
laws
of
other
states
will
vary
but
are
probably
similar
title
of
mississippi
code
defines
our
militia
as
all
ablebodied
citizens
of
the
state
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
sixty
two
years
the
militia
is
divided
into
classes
the
national
guard
the
mississippi
state
guard
and
the
unorganized
militia
the
national
guard
is
a
strange
sort
of
fish
from
a
constitutional
perspective
it
tries
to
be
both
state
militia
and
federal
reserve
the
discussion
of
this
paraconstitutional
arrangement
is
quite
interesting
in
itself
but
somewhat
beyond
the
scope
of
this
discussion
suffice
it
that
at
this
date
the
national
guard
has
ceased
to
have
any
constitutional
standing
as
anything
but
a
federal
reserve
force
mississippi
and
most
other
states
maintains
a
purely
state
organized
militia
in
mississippi
this
is
called
the
state
guard
in
other
states
it
may
be
called
something
else
the
state
guard
exists
as
a
cadre
or
training
corps
made
up
of
mostly
experienced
officers
and
senior
ncos
who
serve
as
volunteers
without
compensation
we
drill
on
a
monthly
basis
at
the
company
and
battalion
level
brigade
once
a
quarter
and
have
an
annual
drill
of
the
whole
organization
our
stateauthorized
cadre
strength
is
this
is
a
skeleton
of
an
organization
without
any
flesh
the
muscle
and
sinew
when
needed
will
come
from
the
unorganized
militia
in
time
of
invasion
insurrection
or
calamity
the
governor
can
order
the
activation
of
the
state
guard
when
this
takes
place
a
call
will
first
be
made
for
volunteers
to
fill
the
organization
out
to
either
its
contingency
strength
of
or
full
strength
of
in
the
event
that
a
sufficient
number
of
people
fail
to
volunteer
the
law
provides
detailed
instructions
for
the
conducting
of
a
draft
of
the
unorganized
militia
the
size
of
the
state
guard
is
not
specified
by
law
but
rather
by
executive
order
at
one
time
the
organized
militia
of
mississippi
consisted
of
regiments
needless
to
say
the
state
does
not
have
armories
brimming
with
weapons
with
which
to
equip
such
a
force
the
historical
precedent
for
arming
such
a
force
is
by
use
of
mostly
the
private
arms
of
the
militiamen
it
is
my
hope
that
demonstrates
that
state
militias
are
far
from
being
the
long
dead
anachronisms
that
some
may
wish
to
claim
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
and
i
have
also
stated
that
a
militia
that
meets
once
or
twice
a
year
is
clearly
well
organized
and
this
state
of
readiness
that
i
have
claimed
the
people
have
a
right
to
is
the
same
state
of
readiness
expected
of
the
militia
as
stated
by
hamilton
regarding
hamilton
if
you
take
hamiltons
opinion
as
being
the
sole
representative
of
the
opinions
of
the
founding
fathers
you
will
have
chosen
a
highly
skewed
sample
set
hamilton
was
on
the
extreme
federalist
end
of
the
political
spectrum
others
such
as
coxe
and
henry
can
be
chosen
to
represent
the
other
end
many
contemporaries
felt
that
the
idea
of
having
a
standing
army
of
any
sort
or
even
a
select
militia
or
train
bands
were
contrary
to
the
egalitarian
nature
of
the
govern
ment
they
were
striving
to
perfect
the
compromise
reached
was
to
provide
for
a
small
army
which
had
to
be
refinanced
every
two
years
and
ironclad
protection
for
the
militia
which
was
to
remain
ever
terrible
and
irresistible
these
protections
included
state
control
not
federal
limitation
of
federal
utilization
of
the
militia
ie
execute
laws
suppress
insurrections
and
repel
invasions
and
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
prevent
what
the
british
had
tried
to
do
at
lexington
these
limitations
eventually
proved
so
onerous
to
the
federal
govern
ment
that
they
were
skirted
by
the
creation
of
the
national
guard
the
national
guard
was
created
for
one
very
simple
reason
the
constitutional
militia
was
had
proved
too
unreliable
for
fighting
wars
of
imperial
expansion
eg
spanishamerican
war
the
constitution
provided
that
the
militia
could
only
be
employed
by
the
federal
government
in
very
limited
purposes
as
far
back
as
the
war
of
militia
units
had
refused
to
leave
united
states
territory
to
attack
the
enemy
further
there
was
no
constitutional
authorization
for
any
conscription
of
anyone
into
the
federal
military
and
militiamen
were
particularly
protected
in
all
wars
until
wwi
every
american
who
left
the
country
under
arms
was
a
volunteer
when
the
national
guard
acts
of
required
that
each
new
member
also
enlist
as
a
reservest
in
the
army
existing
soldiers
were
grandfathered
at
least
one
of
these
grandfathered
individuals
refused
to
go
to
france
in
and
his
refusal
was
upheld
by
the
federal
courts
mr
rutledge
has
stated
that
the
second
amendment
applies
only
to
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
however
the
preconstitutional
history
of
the
american
militia
shows
relatively
few
periods
when
the
militia
came
close
to
meeting
either
messrs
rutledge
or
hamiltons
definition
of
well
organized
in
the
period
of
peace
between
the
french
indian
war
and
the
revolution
many
companies
simply
stopped
drilling
and
had
to
be
reconstituted
just
prior
to
the
revolution
perhaps
mr
rutledge
would
care
to
argue
that
those
of
my
ancestors
who
answered
the
lexington
alarm
had
forfeited
their
rights
because
their
units
didnt
drill
for
a
few
years
in
the
i
would
not
be
so
bold
again
i
wish
to
repeat
the
national
guard
for
all
its
merits
is
not
the
militia
described
by
the
constitution
nor
by
mr
hamilton
nor
by
mr
henry
nor
by
mr
coxe
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
and
many
states
are
delinquent
in
their
attentions
to
and
organizing
of
their
constitutional
militias
diminishes
neither
their
responsibilities
nor
the
rights
of
the
militia
as
detailed
in
the
constitution
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
militia
is
but
one
error
that
has
crept
into
modern
readings
of
the
constitution
the
constitution
prohibits
states
from
keeping
troops
or
ships
of
war
in
time
of
peace
i
have
heard
some
insist
this
prevents
states
from
maintaining
a
militia
but
this
comes
about
because
people
today
do
not
understand
the
meanings
of
the
words
in
their
century
usage
today
we
call
any
large
vessel
a
ship
but
in
the
century
the
word
described
a
particular
kind
of
vessel
a
ship
is
a
large
vessel
with
three
or
more
masts
each
carrying
square
rigged
sails
a
brig
has
two
masts
in
the
contemporary
usage
the
states
were
prohibited
only
from
keeping
the
largest
warships
of
the
day
those
capable
of
global
operations
todays
equivalent
might
be
a
prohibition
on
the
states
keeping
nuclear
missiles
troops
at
this
time
meant
a
fulltime
professional
military
organization
any
study
of
contemporaneous
writings
will
bear
this
out
in
at
least
one
respect
i
am
in
agreement
with
mr
rutledge
being
personally
involved
in
the
maintenance
and
advancement
of
the
militia
as
a
viable
means
of
defense
for
a
modern
society
i
am
frequently
both
bemused
and
saddened
when
friends
and
associates
wax
poetic
on
their
place
in
the
unorganized
militia
and
become
strangely
silent

from

in
i
am
not
pleased
with
the
batf
handling
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungled
it
badly
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
responsible
for
the
fire
which
started
in
two
different
places
two
places
eh
you
saw
this
or
did
the
wonderful
fbi
tell
you
this
i
saw

i
believe
that
this
was
reported
by
local

reporters
on

fire
started
in
a
three
story
tower
at
the
same
time
as
the

window
shown

the
batf
is
by
no

devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenty

willing

small

fire

were

couldnt

eh
this
is
the
most
important
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
cause
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mentioning
how
reagan
and
the
military
treated
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
precedent
but
decided
it
wasnt
worthy

if
the

reporter
got
shot
you
can
bet
his
family
would
sue
the
government
for
letting
him

the
root

of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
why
people
wouldnt
flee

that
had
numerous

during
the

it
took

the
folks
inside
im
not
proposing
this
as
the
way
it
went
down
but
just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be
alive
today
you
can
believe
that
if
you
wish
it
is
undeniable
however
that
people
have
left
the
compound
unharmed
and
alive
earier
in
the
standoff
and
since
their
leader
was
preaching
that
they
would
have
an
apocalypse
you
can
not
say
undeniably
that
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
mass
suicide
if
the
fbi
had
simply
stayed
outside
and
waited
another
days
my
heart
bleeds
just
as
much
as
yours
for
the
children
who
were
never
released
given
days
of
ample
opportunities
to
do
so
my
heart
also
bleeds
for
people
so
blinded
by
religious
devotion
to
not
have
the
common
sense
to
leave
the
compound
when
tanks
came
up
and
started
dropping
in
tear
gas
early
in
the
morning
my
heart
bleeds
for
no
one
you
are
the
bleeding
heart
and
im
sure
beyond
any
possible
doubt
that
you
do
not
feel
for
those
people
as
i
do
you
can
not
say
the
heartless
things
you
have
said
if
you
did
i
am
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
you
are
not
making
sense
you
seem
to
have
no
concern
that
someone
would
keep
children
inside
this
compound
when
they
had
days
to
let
them
out
that
sounds
pretty
heartless
to
me
i
just
heard
on
the
news
that
some
of
the
survivors
regret
they
hadnt
stayed
in
the
inferno
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
koresh
this
makes
me
sad
and
sick
you
seem
to
say
they
got
what
they
deserved
i
do
not
think
this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very
quickly
then
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
put
into
motion
themselves
they
got
what
they
wanted
what
kind
of
creature
are
you
that
you
can
believe
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
jonestown
the
sad
thing
is
the
people
inside
the
compound
were
the
authority
worshipers
and
their
only
authority
was
koreshhowell
if
these
people
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
there
would
likely
be
a
lot
more
survivors
today
koresh
preached
a
fiery
apocalypse
as
early
as
last
year
i
see
the
batf
is
going
to
be
investigated
by
the
justice
dept
and
likely
by
arlen
spectre
and
congress
this
is
good
they
have
bungled
the
affair
from
the
start
we
agree
on
this
now
lets
have
your
god
the
fbi
investigated
too
by
all
means
the
fbi
should
be
investigated
too

light
on

it
was
widely

that
there
were

starting

it
has
also
been

the

broke

rules
out
a

the

consider
this
the

had
more

one

the

made
more

did
anyone

notice
on

that
it

wherever

coming

there

the
fact

and
i
suppose
the

also
prevented
them
from
coming

their

up

would
you
have
come
out
if
you
knew
the
only
national
tv
cameras
were
well
over
a
mile
away
and
yet
the
agents
with
the
guns
were
only
a
few
yards
away
they
had
contact
with
a
lawyer
so
i
am
inclined
to
believe
they
had
an
idea
of
what
their
situation
actually
was
this
also
leads
to
the
conspiracy
theory
that
the
lawyer
had
the
batf
pinned
on
rights
violations
if
the
bds
acted
as
witnesses
hence
the
arson
i
doubt
that
one
too
but
it
is
still
quite
clear
that
leaving
a
safe
place
to
surrender
is
a
rather
stupid
thing
to
do
until
that
place
is
no
longer
safe
do
you
disbelieve
everything
the
fbi
says
as
a
matter
of
course
given
how
theyve
allowed
no
other
views
to
be
heard
ill
reserve
judgement
until
the
trial
but
so
far
as
the
fbi
is
concerned
their
statements
carry
the
same
amount
of
weight
as
photons
at
rest
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
ludicrous
yes
possible
yes
plausible
get
the
jury
if
the
fire
were
set
by
accident
or
by
people
outside
the
compound
i
would
have
expected
far
more
cult
members
to
flee
the
compound
or
at
least
come
out
shooting
thats
what
gets
me
too
it
is
likely
the
cult
members
were
holed
up
in
an
enforced
place
inside
the
building
with
a
decent
arson
attempt
i
suspect
many
of
them
could
have
been
trapped

the

proving

claims

the
fire
started

knocked

me

which

proclivities
justified

again
i
was
merely
addressing
the
sanity
level
of

i
agree
that
the
batf
handled
the
affair
badly
from
day
one
btw
i
heard
on
the

today
that
the
affadavit

today
grenade
launcher
was
the
only
thing
on
the
list
that
i
found
unusual
two
of
the
nine
who
escaped
the
compound
said
the
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
cult
members
so
when
they
talk

will
you

do
you

its
not

nobody

would

because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his

therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the

gave

release
from
the
white

remarks
on

april
following
are
remarks
by
president
clinton
in
a
question
and
answer
session
with
the
press
pm
edt
the
president
on
february
the
four
federal
agents
were
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
trying
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
branch
davidian
compound
which
had
illegally
stockpiled
weaponry
and
ammunition
and
placed
innocent
children
at
risk
because
the
batf
operation
had
failed
to
meet
its
objective
a
standoff
ensued
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
then
made
every
reasonable
effort
to
bring
this
perilous
situation
to
an
end
without
bloodshed
and
further
loss
of
life
the
bureaus
efforts
were
ultimately
unavailing
because
the
individual
with
whom
they
were
dealing
david
koresh
was
dangerous
irrational
and
probably
insane
he
engaged
in
numerous
activities
which
violated
both
federal
law
and
common
standards
of
decency
he
was
moreover
responsible
for
the
deaths
and
injuries
which
occurred
during
the
action
against
the
compound
in
february
given
his
inclination
towards
violence
and
in
an
effort
to
protect
his
young
hostages
no
provocative
actions
were
taken
for
more
than
seven
weeks
by
federal
agents
against
the
compound
this
weekend
i
was
briefed
by
attorney
general
reno
on
an
operation
prepared
by
the
fbi
designed
to
increase
pressure
on
koresh
and
persuade
those
in
the
compound
to
surrender
peacefully
the
plan
included
a
decision
to
withhold
the
use
of
ammunition
even
in
the
face
of
fire
and
instead
to
use
tear
gas
that
would
not
cause
permanent
harm
to
health
but
would
it
was
hoped
force
the
people
in
the
compound
to
come
outside
and
to
surrender
i
was
informed
of
the
plan
to
end
the
siege
i
discussed
it
with
attorney
general
reno
i
asked
the
questions
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
for
me
to
ask
i
then
told
her
to
do
what
she
thought
was
right
and
i
take
full
responsibility
for
the
implementation
of
the
decision
yesterdays
action
ended
in
a
horrible
human
tragedy
mr
koreshs
response
to
the
demands
for
his
surrender
by
federal
agents
was
to
destroy
himself
and
murder
the
children
who
were
his
captives
as
well
as
all
the
other
people
who
were
there
who
did
not
survive
he
killed
those
he
controlled
and
he
bears
ultimate
responsibility
for
the
carnage
that
ensued
now
we
must
review
the
past
with
an
eye
towards
the
future
i
have
directed
the
united
stated
departments
of
justice
and
treasury
to
undertake
a
vigorous
and
thorough
investigation
to
uncover
what
happened
and
why
and
whether
anything
could
have
been
dne
differently
i
have
told
the
departments
to
involve
independent
professional
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
investigation
i
expect
to
receive
analysis
and
answers
in
whatever
time
is
required
to
complete
the
review
finally
i
have
directed
the
departments
to
cooperate
fully
with
all
congressional
inquiries
so
that
we
can
continue
to
be
fully
accountable
to
the
american
people
i
want
to
express
my
appreciation
to
the
attorney
general
to
the
justice
department
and
to
the
federal
agents
on
the
front
lines
who
did
the
best
job
they
could
under
deeply
difficult
circumstances
again
i
want
to
say
as
i
did
yesterday
i
am
very
sorry
for
the
loss
of
life
which
occurred
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
this
tragedy
in
waco
i
hope
very
much
that
others
who
will
be
tempted
to
join
cults
and
to
become
involved
with
people
like
david
koresh
will
be
deterred
by
the
horrible
scenes
they
have
seen
over
the
last
seven
weeks
and
i
hope
very
much
that
the
difficult
situations
which
federal
agents
confronted
there
and
which
they
will
be
doubtless
required
to
confront
in
other
contexts
in
the
future
will
be
somewhat
better
handled
and
better
understood
because
of
what
has
been
learned
now
q
mr
president
can
you
first
of
all
tell
us
why
after
days
you
decided
q
mr
president
can
you
describe
for
us
what
it
is
that
janet
reno
outlined
to
you
in
your
phone
conversation
with
the
president
i
cant
hear
you
both
if
one
will
go
first
and
then
the
other
q
sorry
can
you
describe
what
janet
reno
q
mr
president
the
president
ill
answer
both
your
questions
but
i
cant
do
it
at
once
q
can
you
describe
what
she
told
you
on
sunday
about
the
nature
of
the
operation
and
how
much
detail
you
knew
about
it
the
president
yes
i
was
told
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
fbi
strongly
felt
that
the
time
had
come
to
take
another
step
in
trying
to
dislodge
the
people
in
the
compound
and
she
described
generally
what
the
operation
would
be
that
they
wanted
to
go
in
and
use
tear
gas
which
had
been
tested
not
to
cause
permanent
damage
to
adults
or
to
children
but
which
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
people
to
stay
inside
the
building
and
it
was
hoped
that
the
tear
gas
would
permit
them
to
come
outside
i
was
further
told
that
under
no
circumstances
would
our
people
fire
any
shots
at
them
even
if
fired
upon
they
were
going
to
shoot
the
tear
gas
from
armored
vehicles
which
would
protect
them
and
there
would
be
no
exchange
of
fire
in
fact
as
you
know
an
awful
lot
of
shots
were
fired
by
the
cult
members
at
the
federal
officials
there
were
no
shots
coming
back
from
the
government
side
i
asked
a
number
of
questions
the
first
question
i
asked
is
why
now
we
have
waited
seven
weeks
why
now
the
reasons
i
was
given
were
the
following
number
one
that
there
was
a
limit
to
how
long
the
federal
authorities
could
maintain
with
their
limited
resources
the
quality
and
intensity
of
coverage
by
experts
there
they
might
be
needed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
number
two
that
the
people
who
had
reviewed
this
had
never
seen
a
case
quite
like
this
one
before
and
they
were
convinced
that
no
progress
had
been
made
recently
and
no
progress
was
going
to
be
made
through
the
normal
means
of
getting
koresh
and
the
other
cult
members
to
come
out
number
three
that
the
danger
of
their
doing
something
to
themselves
or
to
others
was
likely
to
increase
not
decrease
with
the
passage
of
time
and
number
four
that
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
children
who
were
still
inside
the
compound
were
being
abused
significantly
as
well
as
being
forced
to
live
in
unsanitary
and
unsafe
conditions
so
for
those
reasons
they
wanted
to
move
at
that
time
the
second
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general
is
whether
they
had
given
consideration
to
all
of
the
things
that
could
go
wrong
and
evaluated
them
against
what
might
happen
that
was
good
she
said
that
the
fbi
personnel
on
the
scene
and
those
working
with
them
were
convinced
that
the
chances
of
bad
things
happening
would
only
increase
with
the
passage
of
time
the
third
question
i
asked
was
has
the
military
been
consulted
as
soon
as
the
initial
tragedy
came
to
light
in
waco
thats
the
first
thing
i
asked
to
be
done
because
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
not
a
typical
law
enforcement
situation
military
people
were
then
brought
in
helped
to
analyze
the
situation
and
some
of
the
problems
that
were
presented
by
it
and
so
i
asked
if
the
military
had
been
consulted
the
attorney
general
said
that
they
had
and
that
they
were
in
basic
agreement
that
there
was
only
one
minor
tactical
difference
of
opinion
between
the
fbi
and
the
military
something
that
both
sides
thought
was
not
of
overwhelming
significance
having
asked
those
questions
and
gotten
those
answers
i
said
that
if
she
thought
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
that
she
should
proceed
and
that
i
would
support
it
and
i
stand
by
that
today
q
mr
president
the
president
wait
go
ahead
q
can
you
address
the
widespread
perception
reported
widely
television
radio
and
newspapers
that
you
were
trying
somehow
to
distance
yourself
from
this
disaster
the
president
no
im
bewildered
by
it
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
let
me
say
the
only
reason
i
made
no
public
statement
yesterday
is
that
i
had
nothing
to
add
to
what
was
being
said
and
i
literally
did
not
know
until
rather
late
in
the
day
whether
anybody
was
still
alive
other
than
those
who
had
been
actually
seen
and
taken
to
the
hospital
or
taken
into
custody
it
was
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
waiting
for
events
to
unfold
there
was
i
have
i
cant
account
for
why
people
speculated
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
talked
to
the
attorney
general
on
the
day
before
the
action
took
place
i
talked
to
her
yesterday
i
called
her
again
late
last
night
after
she
appeared
on
the
larry
king
show
and
i
talked
to
her
again
this
morning
a
president
it
is
not
possible
for
a
president
to
distance
himself
from
things
that
happen
when
the
federal
government
is
in
control
i
will
say
this
however
i
was
frankly
surprised
would
be
a
mild
word
to
say
that
anyone
that
would
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
should
resign
because
some
religious
fanatics
murdered
themselves
applause
i
regret
what
happened
but
it
is
not
possible
in
this
life
to
control
the
behavior
of
others
in
every
circumstance
these
people
killed
four
federal
officials
in
the
line
of
duty
they
were
heavily
armed
they
fired
on
federal
officials
yesterday
repeatedly
and
they
were
never
fired
back
on
we
did
everything
we
could
to
avoid
the
loss
of
life
they
made
the
decision
to
immolate
themselves
and
i
regret
it
terribly
and
i
feel
awful
about
the
children
but
in
the
end
the
last
comment
i
had
from
janet
reno
is
when
and
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
i
said
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
once
more
why
you
believe
not
why
they
believe
why
you
believe
we
should
move
now
rather
than
wait
some
more
and
she
said
its
because
of
the
children
they
have
evidence
that
those
children
are
still
being
abused
and
that
theyre
in
increasingly
unsafe
conditions
and
that
they
dont
think
it
will
get
any
easier
with
time
with
the
passage
of
time
i
have
to
take
their
word
for
that
so
that
is
where
i
think
things
stand
q
can
we
assume
then
that
you
dont
think
this
was
mishandled
in
view
of
the
outcome
that
you
didnt
run
out
of
patience
and
if
you
had
it
to
do
over
again
would
you
really
decide
that
way
the
president
no
well
i
think
what
you
can
assume
is
just
exactly
what
i
announced
today
this
is
a
the
fbi
has
done
a
lot
of
things
right
for
this
country
over
a
long
period
of
time
this
is
the
same
fbi
that
found
the
people
that
bombed
the
world
trade
center
in
licketysplit
record
time
we
want
an
inquiry
to
analyze
the
steps
along
the
way
is
there
something
else
we
should
have
known
is
there
some
other
question
they
should
have
asked
is
there
some
other
question
i
should
have
asked
can
i
say
for
sure
that
no
one
that
we
could
have
done
nothing
else
to
make
the
outcome
come
different
i
dont
know
that
thats
why
i
want
the
inquiry
and
thats
why
i
would
like
to
make
sure
that
we
have
some
independent
law
enforcement
people
not
political
people
but
totally
nonpolitical
outside
experts
who
can
bring
to
bear
the
best
evidence
we
have
there
is
unfortunately
a
rise
in
this
sort
of
fanaticism
all
across
the
world
and
we
may
have
to
confront
it
again
and
i
want
to
know
whether
there
is
anything
we
can
do
particularly
when
there
are
children
involved
but
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
wrongdoers
in
this
case
were
the
people
who
killed
others
and
then
killed
themselves
q
mr
president
were
there
any
other
options
presented
to
you
for
resolving
this
situation
at
any
point
from
february
until
yesterday
the
president
well
yes
i
got
regular
reports
all
along
the
way
there
were
lots
of
other
options
pursued
if
you
go
back
you
all
covered
it
very
well
the
fbi
you
did
a
very
good
job
of
it
i
mean
the
fbi
and
the
other
authorities
there
pursued
any
number
of
other
options
all
along
the
way
and
a
lot
of
them
early
on
seemed
to
be
working
some
of
the
children
got
out
some
of
the
other
people
left
there
was
a
at
one
point
there
seemed
to
be
some
lines
of
communication
opening
up
between
koresh
and
the
authorities
and
then
he
would
say
things
and
not
do
them
and
things
just
began
to
spin
downward
whether
there
were
other
in
terms
of
what
happened
yesterday
the
conversation
i
had
with
the
attorney
general
did
not
involve
other
options
except
whether
we
should
take
more
time
with
the
present
strategy
we
were
pursuing
because
they
said
they
wanted
to
do
this
because
they
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
get
people
out
of
the
compound
quickly
before
they
could
kill
themselves
thats
what
they
thought
q
did
the
government
know
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
q
congressional
hearings
once
the
situation
are
you
in
agreement
with
that
the
president
thats
up
to
the
congress
they
can
do
whatever
they
want
but
i
think
its
very
important
that
the
treasury
and
justice
departments
launch
this
investigation
and
bring
in
some
outside
experts
and
as
i
said
in
my
statement
if
any
congressional
committees
want
to
look
into
it
we
will
fully
cooperate
there
is
nothing
to
hide
here
this
was
probably
the
most
wellcovered
operation
of
its
kind
in
the
history
of
the
country
more
more
subject
waco

press
conference
part
here
is
a
press
release
from
the
white
house
president
clintons
remarks
on
waco
with
qa
to
national
desk
contact
white
house
office
of
the
press
secretary
washington
april
us
newswire
following
are
remarks
by
president
clinton
in
a
question
and
answer
session
with
the
press
part
of
go
ahead
sarah
q
there
are
two
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
the
first
is
i
think
that
they
knew
very
well
that
the
children
did
not
have
gas
masks
while
the
adults
did
so
the
children
had
no
chance
because
this
gas
was
very
she
said
it
was
not
lethal
but
it
was
very
dangerous
to
the
children
and
they
could
not
have
survived
without
gas
masks
and
on
february
lets
go
back
didnt
those
people
have
a
right
to
practice
their
religion
the
president
they
were
not
just
practicing
their
religion
they
were
the
treasury
department
believed
that
they
had
violated
federal
laws
any
number
of
them
q
what
federal
laws
the
president
let
me
go
back
and
answer
i
cant
answer
the
question
about
the
gas
masks
except
to
tell
you
that
the
whole
purpose
of
using
the
tear
gas
was
that
it
had
been
tested
they
were
convinced
that
it
wouldnt
kill
either
a
child
or
an
adult
but
it
would
force
anybody
that
breathed
it
to
run
outside
and
one
of
the
things
that
ive
heard
i
dont
want
to
get
into
the
details
of
this
because
i
dont
know
but
one
of
the
things
that
they
were
speculating
about
today
was
that
the
wind
was
blowing
so
fast
that
the
windows
might
have
been
opened
and
some
of
the
gas
might
have
escaped
and
that
may
be
why
it
didnt
have
the
desired
effect
they
also
knew
sarah
that
there
was
an
underground
compound
a
bus
buried
underground
where
the
children
could
be
sent
and
they
were
i
think
they
were
hoping
very
much
that
if
the
children
were
not
released
immediately
outside
that
the
humane
thing
would
be
done
and
that
the
children
would
be
sent
someplace
where
they
could
be
protected
in
terms
of
the
gas
masks
themselves
i
learned
yesterday
i
did
not
ask
this
fact
question
before
that
the
gas
was
supposed
to
stay
active
in
the
compound
longer
than
the
gas
masks
themselves
were
to
work
so
that
it
was
thought
that
even
if
they
all
had
gas
masks
that
eventually
the
gas
would
force
them
out
in
a
nonviolent
nonshooting
circumstance
ms
myers
last
question
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
that
q
could
you
tell
us
whether
or
not
you
ever
asked
janet
reno
about
the
possibility
of
a
mass
suicide
and
when
you
learned
about
the
actual
fire
and
explosion
what
went
through
your
mind
during
those
horrendous
moments
the
president
what
i
asked
janet
reno
is
if
they
had
considered
all
the
worse
things
that
could
happen
and
she
said
and
of
course
the
whole
issue
of
suicide
had
been
raised
in
the
public
he
had
that
had
been
debated
anyway
and
she
said
that
the
people
who
were
most
knowledgeable
about
these
kinds
of
issues
concluded
that
there
was
no
greater
risk
of
that
now
than
there
would
be
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
that
or
at
anytime
in
the
future
that
was
the
judgment
they
made
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
of
course
we
will
never
know
what
happened
when
i
saw
the
fire
when
i
saw
the
building
burning
i
was
sick
i
felt
terrible
and
my
immediate
concern
was
whether
the
children
had
gotten
out
and
whether
they
were
escaping
or
whether
they
were
inside
trying
to
burn
themselves
up
thats
the
first
thing
i
wanted
to
know
thank
you
q
mr
president
why
are
you
still
saying
it
was
a
janet
reno
decision
isnt
it
in
the
end
your
decision
the
president
well
what
im
saying
is
that
i
didnt
have
a
four
or
fivehour
detailed
briefing
from
the
fbi
i
didnt
go
over
every
strategic
part
of
it
it
is
a
decision
for
which
i
take
responsibility
im
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
signed
off
on
the
general
decision
and
giving
her
the
authority
to
make
the
last
call
when
i
talked
to
her
on
sunday
some
time
had
elapsed
she
might
have
made
a
decision
to
change
her
mind
i
said
if
you
decide
to
go
forward
with
this
tomorrow
i
will
support
you
and
i
do
support
her
she
is
not
ultimately
responsible
to
the
american
people
i
am
but
i
think
she
has
conducted
her
duties
in
an
appropriate
fashion
and
she
has
dealt
with
this
situation
i
think
as
well
as
she
could
have
thank
you

but
do
you

how
much

is
required
to

a

twice
a

just
to
try

the

provide
a

to

so
they
can
be
integrated
into

and
find
a
suitable
location
it
requires
a
continually
standing
committee
of
organizers
again
my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
wrong
neglecting
that
the
government
and
media
have
bullshitted
the
people
almost
nonstop
on
this
issue
constitutional
limitations
are
there
to
prevent
a
tyrrany
of
the
majority
for
example
a
majority
could
vote
that
given
ethnics
have
no
rights
are
not
people
etc
and
it
would
fly
using
the
logic
above
when
government
feels
the
constitution
is
not
right
for
the
times
there
is
a
procedure
called
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
this
is
deliberately
difficult
and
cumbersome
to
prevent
abuse
of
those
who
decide
to
ignore
the
people
or
impose
unjust
policies
of
a
majority
on
a
minority
a
lynch
mob
is
a
majority
remember
outvoting
the
hangee
what
the
government
is
doing
are
violations
endruns
around
the
limitations
on
the
government
probably
because
they
know
that
the
people
would
be
very
hard
to
convince
that
a
good
intention
is
behind
tampering
with
the
bill
of
rights
government
propeganda

has
been
very
strong

not

all
believed

was

koresh
had

married

these
were
the

from
the
great

of

exmembers
describe
him
in
ways
not

to
the

jim

i
dont
know
how
accurate
the

was
the
documentary
interviewed
koresh
and
current
and
exmembers
the
documentary
disucussed
koreshs

unusual

practices
the

gets
any
he
wants

when
they
can

cant
i
will
let
others
decide
if
using
religious
authority
to
have
sex
with
a
minor
is
technically
child
abuse
or
not
however
koresh
was
never
convicted
of
any
crimes
against
children
nor
was
the
batf
after
him
for
child
abuse
their
purview
in
this
case
is
strictly
in
firearms
violations
all
true
so
this
information
is
irrelevant
to
the
discussion
well
if
a
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
members
of
the
cult
then
the
history
and
background
of
the
cult
is
very
relevant
the
history
and
backgournd
of
the
jones
cult
was
very
important
in
understanding
what
happened
at
jonestown
not
taking
into
account
the
history
and
background
of
koreshs
cult
may
also
help
explain
why
the
fbi
and
batf
so
badly
predicted
the
reponses
they
would
get
from
inside
the
compund
nearly
every
step
of
the
way
in
this
badly
handled
affair
fbi
agents
have
to
pass
rigorous
psychological
examinations
and
background
checks
plus
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
their
decisions
in
great
detail
to
congress
why
would
the
fbi
want
to
fulfill
koreshs
own
prophecy
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
something
but
whether
their
answers
even
remotely
resembles
the
truth
we
may
never
know
and
who
is
left
alive
to
care
whether
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
it
only
holds
meaning
for
the
nine
who
survived
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
at
least
two
investigations
jd
and
congress
at
this
point
correction
the
fbi
said
that
two
of
the
cult
members
said
this
so
far
no
one
else
has
been
able
to
talk
to
them
so
when
they
talk

will
you
believe
them
if
they
confirm
the

i
probably
will
definitely
not
until
then
however
interesting
and
conflicting
details
are
starting
to
come
out
i
have
reverted
back
to

if
any

a

you

our

the

we

i
dont
know
whether
anyone
has
measured
such
a
figure
among

i
would
expect
the

result
they
certainly
seem
to
vote
that
way
according
to

book
the

over
twelve
million

have
been
served

were

the
point
that
i
forgot
to
bring
up
here
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
g
bein
a
gang
member
or
not
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
concealed

in

thi

for
that
matter
right
it
nas
nothing
to
do
with
whther
or
not
the
person
iswas
a

but
thats
what
kratz
inferred
wrong
there
are
people
who
can
legally
carry
concealed
in

and
there
are
circumstances
under
which
many

can
carry
concealed
is

really
too
much

heres
what

from

the

that
i

make
because
i
know

looked
this

up
in

this
is
for
you
andy
statutes
before
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a

in

also
for

then

there
is
no
such

here

the
part

with
this

and
post
it
ordinary
citizens
can
not
get
a
license
to
carry
a
concealed

there
are
very
few
people
who
can
i
even
asked
my

friend
about
this
and
he
told
me
that
only
certain
people
can
get

for
concealed
carry
he
couldnt
remember
which
people
but
he
knew
for
sure
that
regular

couldnt

type
of

he
told

they

they
did

they
fucked
up
even
in

the
most
basic
military
sense
they
fucked
up
excuses
do
not

body
counts
the
batf
needs
more
people
better
weapons
and
more
armored
transports
when
they
meet
hostile
fire
they
should
be
able
to
use
more
force
instead
of
retreating
to
a
stand
off
if
you
are
going

then
do
it
right
the
batf
is
there
to

and
they
must
have
the

people
to
do
the
job
and
your
excuses
fall
upon
deaf
ears
when
the
same
batf
has
shown
shitty
leadership
despite
more
people
better
weapons
and
exclusive
use
of
armor
against
their
targets
batf
is
nothing
more
than
a
private
army
of
the
government
do
the
agents
swear
an
oath
as
i
did
to
uphold
the
constitution
you
know
that
document
that
stipulates
the
highest
law
of
the
land
if
they
do
they
should
be
up
for
charges
in

remember
the

thats
the
whole
reason
for
any
of
this
with
the
wod
and
the
increased
crime
in
the

the
batf
is
needed
more
now
then
ever
if
they
blast

a

good

then
that
is
the
price
we
all
have

in

look
at
all
the
good
people
that
died
in

to
protect
this
great
country
of

yeah
ive
been

this
is
flamebait
right
im
not
paying
your

mind
if
i
sight
in

think

it
as
the
price
you
have
to
pay
that
we
may
all
live
without
fear
of
my
making
a

shot
its
fine
and
dandy
to
revel
in
the

being
the
target
and
your
supposed
safety

we
called

being
a
catchy

nothing
more

a

seems
to
have
gotten
you
convinced

you
can

we
have

in

as
well

a
fair

unbiased
judiciary
with
the

build
up
in

they
needed
to
hit
that
compound
with
mega
fire
power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a

women
and

it
would

been
better
then
letting
them
all
burn
to
death
days
later
mind
if
we
include
you
in
the

count
im
sure
we
could
all
file
it
under
civic
improvement
and
your

wouldnt
have
been
sacrificed
in
vain
if
you
like
you
can
will

you

the

doesnt
protect
everybody
equally

how

one

be

perhaps
at

mature

can

the

doug

he

when
sarah

she
means
street
sweeper
shotguns
and
semiautomatic
sks

i
doubt
she
uses
this

for
that
you
are
using
a

allegedly
from

can
you
back
it
up
when
john

weapons
of

and
then
immediately
follows
it
with
the

thousands
of

this
number
can
easily
be
reduced
by
putting
reasonable
restrictions
on
them
what
does
rutledge
mean
by
the
term
i
read
the
article
as
presenting
first
an
argument
about
weapons
of
mass
destruction
as
commonly
understood
and
then
switching
to
other
topics
the
first
point
evidently
was
to
show
that
not
all
weapons
should
be
allowed
and
then
the

analysis
was
given
this
understanding

five
months
or
five
centuries
down
the
road
i
would
hope
so
lets
define
a
nuclear
weapon
as
an
explosive
weapon
whose
majority
of
energy
comes
from
fission
andor
fusion
of
atomic
nuclei
lets
define
a
biological
weapon
as
live
organisms
or
viruses
in
such
state
quantity
and
with
such
a
vector
that
they
could
cause
death

serious
disease
further
defined

a

number
of
people
if
released
in
a

similarly
populated
area
resevoir
or
cropland
nerve
gas
and
mustard
gas
are

other
poisonous

should
be

banned

it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
no
use
not

licenses

on
such
chemicals
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
these
ideas
could
certainly
be
a
basis
for
definitions
ill
give
you
a
little
hint
see
that
manure
pile
in
the
farmers
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
nope
it
is
not
considered
a
weapon
biological
in
nature
because
if
it
gets
washed
into
an
open
well
it
will
contaminate
the
aquifers
that
supply
thousands
of
cities
with
drinking
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
has
ruled
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illegal
care
to
draw
a
thinner
line
this
time
it
is
not
defined
as
a

many

american
horror
file
call
for
help
todays
atrocity
in
waco
has
finally
impelled
me
to
start
working
on
something
ive
been
thinking
about
for
some
time
over
the
last
few
years
i
have
heard
of
one
case
after
another
of
government
running
completely
amok
unfortunately
most
people
are
oblivious
of
the
governments
crimes
and
still
think
of
it
as
their
protector
so
i
intend
to
put
together
what
i
call
the
american
horror
file
a
compilation
of
cases
where
the
american
government
has
run
roughshod
over
the
rights
of
its
citizens
over
the
last
few
years
focusing
especially
on
deaths
and
injuries
resulting
from
noknock
warrants
and
financial
ruin
to
innocents
resulting
from
civil
forfeiture
laws
but
including
any
other
cases
for
which
i
can
find
decent
documentation
i
hope
to
make
people
bloodboiling
arterybursting
redhot
enraged
at
their
government
the
end
result
will
probably
be
a
book
in
electronic
form
ascii
text
and
postscript
files
detailing
the
governments
crimes
of
recent
years
this
book
will
be
distributed
at
cost
and
i
will
encourage
people
to
post
copies
to
bbss
send
copies
on
disk
to
friends
and
print
out
copies
and
give
them
to
neighbors
this
is
a
call
for
your
help
any
information
that
you
can
send
me
on
how
government
is
running
amok
will
be
greatly
appreciated
i
would
prefer
information
that
is
welldocumented
with
sources
given
about
specific
instances
of
governmental
abuses
i
also
welcome
anyone
who
wants
to
join
me

i
dont

figures
exactly

there
were
about
deaths
in
texas
in
that
was
caused
by
guns
this
is
more
than
those
beeing
killed
in
caraccidents
yes
there
could
be
that
low
sentences
or
high
poverty
could
influence
the
figures
but
theyre
still
pretty
high
right
i
also
believe
texas
has
some
of
the
most
liberal
gunlaws
in
usa
i
should
not
suffer
because
of
others
we
all
agree
on
this
one
but
we
also
live
in
a
sociaty
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
do
you
have
an

then
youll
have
to
pay

of
what

do
do
you

the

is
how
much
one
state
dont
remember
which
texas
tried
to
impose
a
rule
that
you
could
only
buy
one
gun
each
month
think
you
all
know
what
happened
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on
other
people
it
seems
like
you
all
realize
that
you
have
a
problem

the
only
problem
is
that

do
they

is
it
only
going

required
to

when
trying

this
at
least
has
already
been
determined
the
blue
cross
medical
coverage
for
all
federal
employees
is
a
good
model
for
a
future
national
system
to
get
emergency
medical
care
anyone
so
insured
must
always
carry
their
blue
cross
card
before
entering
a
hospital
you
must
notify
blue
cross
or
they
will
refuse
to
pay
your
bills
in
an
emergency
where
you
must
be
treated
before
notifying
them
you
must
inform
them
within
hours
or
if
you
are
unable
to
do
so
for
medical
reasons
the
hospital
must
failing
to
do
so
within
hours
means
they
will
not
cover
the
hospitalization
in
you
need
your
card
to
notify
them
and
without
the
card
the
hospital
certainly
wouldnt
know
they
had
to
therefore
you
are
required
to
carry
the
card
at
all
times
or
do
without
emergency
medical
coverage
which
works
fine
until
you
end
up
in
the
hospital
because
you
were
hit
on
the
head
and
your
wallet
with
your
insurance
card
is
stolen

it
took
six

south

and
convince
people
living
there
that
they
dont
need
guns
to
protect
themselves
because
the

do
it
for
them
dont
lose
the

youll
need
it
to
get
out
a

ride
to
vermont
which
has
almost
no

and
curiously
enough
almost
no

either

since
antigunners
have
heretofore
been
unable

what
a

are
used

what
happened
in

is
not
the
fault
of
the

if
they
would

had
the
proper

and
personal
then
they
could
of
captured
the
compound
on
the
initial
assault
and
none
of
this
would
of
happened
if
theyd
gone
to
the
door
and
knocked
on
it
to
serve
the
warrant
like
the
sheriff
had
done
other
times
they
wouldnt
have
needed
to
have
an
initial
assault
but
then
herr
klinton

attorney

wouldnt
have
been
able

have
told
such
heroic

about
how
they
protected
the
rest

from
a

of

who
kept

miles
out

the

needs
more

better

when
they
meet

they
should
be
able

use

instead
of
retreating
to
a

off
if
you
are

then
do
it
right
the

is
there
to
protect
us
and
they
must
have
the

to
do

the

that

i

i
can

none

fought

the

the

to
attack
its

with
military

serving

is
not

at

not
here
in
the
us
maybe
in
iraq
or
syria
with
the
arms
build
up
in

they
needed
to
hit
that

with

power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a
few

and

but
it
would

been

then
letting

i

yes
i

so

a

was
needed
for
some
reason
could
a

have
resulted
in

the

yes

consider

any

revolver
stun

or
other
firearm
note
that
this
doesnt
affect
all
concealed
carry
look
after
the
word
except
it
always
helps
to
read
the
law
before
commenting
on
it
would
a
prudent
storekeeper
carry
concealed
how
about
someone

yes
there
could

low

could

theyre
still
pretty

right
i
also
believe
texas

and
youd
be

about

too
note
that
texas
isnt

more

deaths
than
withcar
deaths
but
some
of
the
other
states
where
it

have
extremely
strict
gun
laws
oops
so
much
for
the
meaning
it
isnt
clear
that
the
comparision
means
anything
anyway
as
car
accidents
are
unintentional
while
gun
deaths
arent

if
were
going
to
make
it
lets
at

be
honest
i
should
not
suffer
because
of
others
we
all
agree
on
this
one
but
we
also
live
in
a
sociaty
and
therefor
well
have
to
give
up
some
of
our
freedom
note
the
give
it
up
for
what
gun
control
doesnt
have
any
benefits
so
it
fails
by
this
standard
do
you
have
an
insurance
then
youll
have
to
pay
because
of
what
others
do
note
that
insurance
gives
me
something
in
return
gun
control
doesnt
what
the
hell
is
he

when
you
live

usa
are

counted

the

is
how
much
thats
half
the
question
the
rest
is
and
what
do
you
get
for
your
sacrifice
if
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
nothing
as
it
is
for
gun
control
then
we
dont
have
to
ask
the

not

i

all

that
have
been
debating
about
the

the
original
post
claimed
that
the
atffbi
was
pumping
napalm
into
the
building
with
the
hopes
that
the
wood
stove
inside
would
ignite
it
i
responed
with
why
would
the
wood
stove
be
lit
in
the
first
place
it
wouldnt
be
lit
for
heating
purposes
because
of
the
weather
in
texas
everyone
now
claims
that
it
was
for
cooking
stop
and
think
about
this
cs
gas
was
being
pumped
into
the
building
and
i
presume
that
everyone
was
wearing
gas
masks
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
this
had
been
going
on
for
hours
i
dont
know
if
you
have
ever
been
around
cs
but
i
have
being
exposed
to
cs
gas
was
part
of
my
army
training
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
very
uncomfortable
and
makes
your
eyes
water
nose
run
and
makes
you
sick
in
the
stomach
and
with
the
mask
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
water
much
less
eat
so
my
question
now
is
why
were
they
cooking
food
i
will
buy
that
a
lantern
could
have
been
knocked
over
and
caused
the
fire
but
that
stove
was
not
being
used
for
cooking
unless
they
were
even
more
crazy
than
the

oh

did
the

start
from
three

in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
well
i
only
saw
it
start
in
one
place
a
tank
punched
a
hole
in
a
wall
and
as
it
withdrew
flames
came
out
and
spread
quickly
in
the
direction
that
a

wind
was
blowing
i
saw
a
diagram
in
usa
today
yesterday
and
fires
started
at
of
the
holes
that
the
tanks
made
a
terrible
negligent
accident
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying

get
out
of
the
compound
maybe
they
couldnt
ive
often
marvelled
at
how
people
could
get
burned
alive
in
the
upstairs
of
a
story
house
on
fire
but
it
happens
all
the
time
what
if
they
were
in
sealed
rooms
trying
to
avoid
the
gas
and
didnt
know
about
the
fire
until
it
surrounded
them
remember
the
israelis
hiding
in
sealed
rooms
during
desert
storm
to
avoid
gasbearing
scuds
cripes
mark
are
you
really
a
college
student
maybe
you
ought
to
stop
worrying
about
increased
beverage
access
and
start
clearing
your
head
ever
heard
of
questioning
authority
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
ok
ill
buy
that
you
do
seem
totally
clueless
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
wellllll
they
werent
murderous
theyd
never
harmed
or
even
threatened
anybody
until
they
were
attacked
by
a
paramilitary
force
using
military
weapons
and
hardware
and
as
far
as
evidence
what
are
you
talking
about
everything
the
feds
have
said
theyve
retracted
practically
as
soon
as
they
get
questioned
in
detail
about
it
maybe
you
and
your
increased
beverage
access
buddies
sitting
around
the
bar
slurring
stuff
like
they
shoulda
killed
em
all
days
ago
dont
feel
that
way
but
then
youre
probably
one
of
those
people
still
saying
about
klinton
give
the
guy
a
chance
we
dont
even
know
what
hes
gonna
do
burp
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
no
problem
you
dont
have
any
questions
that
scare
any
of
us
most
of
our
minds
are
apparently
more
developed
than
yours
the
answer
is
yes
in
a
fcking
heartbeat
thought
experiment
would
you
be
mindlessly
down
on
your
knees
with
your
mouth
open
blissfully
sucking
up
anything
the
feds
said
if
bush
were
the
president
what
no
comeback
ok
go
ahead
say
it
read
my
lips
no
new
taxes
p
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
not
in
such
a
great
degree
bush
broke
one
promise
maybe
two
taxesguns
and
we
held
him
accountable
for
it
of
course
it
took
him
the
better
part
of
years
to
do
it
slicks
only
been
in
office
days
and
hes
broken
lots
of
them
anddd
i
imagine
hell
also
be
held
accountable
for
that
i
can
just
see
the
campaign
buttons
now
abc
anybody
but
clinton
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
hmmm
apparently
you
just
got
here
nobodys
claiming
that
it
was
anything
but
a
stupid
mistake
by
a
bunch
of
incompetent
public
employees
who
normally
dont
get
this
kind
of
scrutiny
when
the
mess
up
and
as
far
as
how
they
picked
the
davidians
who
knows
maybe
they
figured
that
nobodyd
care
about
such
a
politically
incorrect
group
as
a
bunch
of
fundies
out
on
the
texas
prairie
maybe
they
figured
theyd
just
go
in
there
and
run
roughshod
over
the
bds
during
their
religious
services
which
was
the
reason
the
feds
gave
for
the
timing
of
the
raid
rather
than
running
into
resistance
maybe
they
knew
that
the
bds
werent
anywhere
near
as
violent
as
the
feds
spin
doctors
are
trying
to
tell
the
public
maybe
they
were
afraid
to
try
this
kind
of
thing
on
the
crips
and
bloods
maybe
it
was
because
the
atfs
budget
is
up
for
approval
and
they
seem
to
favor
doing
something
dramatic
whenever
that
is
the
case
of
course
their
reasoning
doesnt
matter
only
what
they
did
and
this
time
people
are
just
paying
more
attention
to
it
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth

you

court
did
they
or
did
they
not

i
dont

the
text
of

case
handy
miller
was
convicted
of
owning
a
sawedoff
shotgun
and
not
paying
the
nfa
tax
snatches
of
the
courts
decision
the
second
amendment
was
intended
to
assure
the
continuation
and
render
possible
the
effectiveness
of
such
a
force
the
militia
it
must
be
interpreted
and
applied
with
that
end
in
view
the
militia
includes
all
males
physically
capable
of
acting
in
concert
for
the
common
defense
however
regarding
sawedoff
shotguns
certainly
it
is
not
within
judicial
notice
that
this
weapon
is
any
part
of
the
ordinary
military
equipment
or
that
its
use
could
contribute
to
the
common
defense
judicial
notice
is
the
term
of
art
here
it
meant
that
no
such
evidence
had
been
formally
presented
this
is
different
from
claiming
that
they
had
ruled
that
it
wasnt
yes
shotguns
had
been
used
in
wwi
the
spanishamerican
war
and
the
us
civil
war
that
was
not
in
question
the
possession
of
a
sawedoff
shotgun
was
ie
a
weapon
altered
to
improve
concealibility
im
not
talking
about
plain
shotguns
in
war
im
talking
about
short
barrelled
sawedoff
shotguns
in
war
compare
revolutionary
war
blunderbusses
luparas
in
the
spanishamerican
war
and
trenchcleaners
in
ww
i
they
were
also
put
to
good
use
by

soldiers
in
ww
ii
not
to
mention
being

to
tunnel
rats
in
vietnam
but
of
course
miller
took
place
in
therefore
us
vs
miller
supports
limited
government
regulation
of
firearms
dont
go
arguing
down
this
road
unless
you
are
willing
to
abide
by
the
consequences
that
you
find
at
the
end
of
it
mainly
that
the
lawabiding
common
man
has
a
right
to
own
any
weapon
that
has
a
militia
purpose
from
handguns
to
sawedoff
shotguns
and
fully
automatic
weapons
that
in
fact
is
what
this
decision
says
you
are
free
to
produce
evidence
that
im
not
willing
to
abide
with
all
the
implications
of
this
here
is
my
quandary
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
certain
types
of
guns
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
second
this
isnt
a
useful
argument
unless
you
believe
that
some
significant
gun
or
class
of
gun
belongs
in
that
class
i
think
we
both
agree
that
zip
guns
probably
arent
protected
maybe
we
also
both
agree
that
all
the
weapons
that
random
state
governments
have
been
banning
or
trying
to
ban
because
they
have
no
sporting
purpose
and
no
provate
citizen
would
ever
need
these
guns
do
fall
under
the
protection
of
the
second
so
given
that
damn
near
any
gun
of
any
practical
utility
is
or
has
at
some
time
been
used
by
the
military
even
if
only
for
marksmanship
training
purposes
i
need
to
understand
why
you
are
intent
on
pressing
this
point
arguing
that
that
something
is
not
protected
by
the
second
just
because
i

endorse
the

this
mention
of
a

is
what
confuses
me
according
to
the
federalist
papers
a
well
regulated
militia
has
a
well
defined
structure
and
follows
nationally
uniform
regulations
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
james
madison
federalist
paper
besides
the
advantage
of
being
armed
which
the
americans
possess
over
the
people
of
almost
every
other
nation
the
existence
of
subordinate
governments
to
which
the
people
are
attached
and
by
which
the
militia
officers
are
appointed
forms
a
barrier
against
the
enterprises
of
ambition
more
insurmountable
than
any
which
a
simple

of

can
admit
of
notwithstanding
the

which
are

little
more
can
reasonably
be
aimed
at
with
respect
to
the
people
at
large
than
to
have
them
properly
armed
and
equipped
and
in
order
to
see
that
this
be
not
neglected
it
will
be
necessary
to
assemble
them
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
a
year
alexander
hamilton
federalist
paper
speaking
of
standing
armies
if
circumstances
should
at
any
time
oblige
the
government
to
form
an
army
of
any
magnitude
that
army
can
never
be
formidable
to
the
liberties
of
the
people
while
there
is
a
large
body
of
citizens
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
them
in
discipline
and
the
use
of
arms
who
stand
ready
to
defend
their
own
rights
and
those
of
their
fellowcitizens
but
surely
hamilton
and
madison
didnt
mean
the
people
when
they
said
people
right
thats
why
the
amendment
refers
to
the
right
of
the
militia
your
average
year
old
male
does
not
fall
into
the
definition
youre
right
the
militia
consists
of
all
able
bodied
males
and
probably
females
under
current
interpretation
therefore
most
members
of
the
militia
the
one
the
every
gun
advocate
refers
to
are
not
members
of
a
well
organized
militia
and
therefore
are
not
directly
the
amendment
does
nor
refer
to
well
organized
it
says
well
regulated
i
have
some
targets
you
may
examine
if
you
wish
to
check
how
well
regulated
i
am
mentioned
in
the
amendment
if
this
amendment
wanted
to
allow
every
member
of
the
militia
to
keep
and
bear
arms
why
did
it
specificly
mention
a
well
organized
militia
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
correct
thats
why
the
right
is
reserved
to
the
people
and
that
was
to
insure
the
people
could
form
a
well
regulated
militia
not
a
well
organized
militia
it
could
be
argued
that
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
is
separate
from
the
last
part
if
so
why
was
it
include
in
the
same
atomic
unit
of
written
what
do
atomic
units
have
to
do
with
this
argument
any
moron
can
set
hbar
c
instead
of
a
separate
sentence
oh
i
see
what
your
question
is
why
dont
you
read
the
federalist
papers
james
madison
federalist
paper
regarding
the
general
welfare
clause
nothing
is
more
natural
nor
common
than
first
to
use
a
general
phrase
and
then
to
explain
and
qualify
it
by
a
recital
of
particulars
but
what
does
madison
know
about
the
grammatical
style
of
the
he
only
wrote
it
the
amendment
also
implies
that
the
right
to
arms
has
to
due
with
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
federalist
papers
mention
of
a
well
regulated
militia
gives
many
examples
of
how
this
militia
protects
the
security
of
a
free
state
all
these
examples
are
actions
of
a
very
organized
force
not
some
john
q
public
with
a
gun
thats
obviously
because
youve
never
actually
read
the
federalist
papers
all
that
the
second
amendment
clearly
states
to
me
is
that
the
peoples
right
to
form
well
regulated
militias
shall
not
be
infringed
that
is
people
have
the
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
this
well
organized
militia
will
of
course
provide
training
in
how
to
use
arms
and
in
basic
military
tactics
these
training
members
of
the
militia
can
keep
and
bear
the
arms
cant
read
huh
show
me
where
the
document
says
well
organized
militia
lastly
reading
through
the
federalist
papers
on
well
organized
militia
it
is
very
clear
that
many
of
the
reasons
for
these
militias
one
reason
stated
is
the
protection
from
a
standing
army
these
days
the
standing
army
could
easily
defeat
a
group
consisting
of
every
year
old
male
and
female
not
in
the
armied
forces
that
is
exactly
why
every
person
should
be
allowed
to
own
any
weapon
currently
in
use
in
the
armed
forces
another
reason
stated
for
well
organized
militias
is
to
reduced
the
need
for
a
standing
army
well
the
us
armied
forces
have
been
a
standing
army
for
more
than
half
the
history
of
the
us
but
the
major
reason
is
to
protect
against
that
very
same
army
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
reason
for
the
second
amendment
to
give
the
people
protection
from
the
us
government
by
guaranteeing
that
the
people
can
over
through
the
government
if
necessary
is
a
little
bit
of
an
anachronism
is
this
day
and
age
maybe
its
time
to
rethink
how
this
should
be
done
and
amend
the
constitution

so
the

must
either
qualify
or
explain
the

a

stuff
deleted
since
the
right

the

to
keep

shall

does
not
describe
modify

make

anything
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
grammar
or
some
sort
of
position
or

by
process
of
elimination
it
must
fall
into
definition
and
since
deals
with
legal
power
the
same
thing
the

does
it
must
be
the
correct
definition
in
this
case
therefore
the
right
of
the

to
keep

gives
legal

to
the

this

ah
clarification
by
obfuscation
actually
the
words
a
well
regulated
milita
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
present
participle
used
as
an
adjective
to
modify
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
the
subject
being
the
right
the
verb
shall
it
asserts
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
essential
for
maintaining
a
milita
the
sentence
doesnt
restrict
the
right
or
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
by
anyone
or
anything
other
than
the

all
it
does
is
make
a
positive
statement
regarding
a
right
of
the
people
the
people
as
in
you
and
me
as
in
the
first
fourth
ninth
tenth
as
well
as
the
second

the
existence
of
this
right
is
assumed
it
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
there
is
no
stated
or
implied
condition
relating
the
right
to
bear
arms
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
to
the

randy
weaver
trial
day
this
was
posted
to
the
firearmspolitics
mailing
list
hi
folks
wednesday
marked
day
the
beginning
of
the
trial
opening
statements
were
given
by
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
each
side
presenting
its
version
of
what
happenned
last
august
the
prosecution
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
idaho
in
anticipating
a
battle
with
the
evil
federal
government
the
prosecution
alleges
that
weaver
sold
federal
agents
sawed
off
shotguns
and
later
failed
to
appear
for
trial
despite
repeated
good
faith
efforts
to
get
weaver
to
surrender
peacefully
weaver
refused
the
shootout
erupted
when
weaver
discovered
agents
on
a
surveillance
mission
and
began
firing
according
to
the
prosecution
three
people
were
taking
an
offensive
action
against
an
fbi
helicopter
when
an
fbi
sniper
killed
vicki
weaver
the
defense
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
northern
idaho
in
to
practice
their
religion
in
peace
they
wanted
simply
to
be
left
alone
weaver
was
induced
by
federal
agents
to
sell
the
shortbarrelled
shotgun
and
did
not
as
the
prosecution
alleged
want
to
become
a
regular
supplier
the
defense
also
argued
that
the
federal
government
sought
to
arrest
weaver
when
he
wouldnt
become
an
informant
it
is
not
specified
explicitly
but
i
assume
that
this
is
a
reference
to
the
white
separatist
angle
of
the
story
well
know
more
as
things
develop
the
failure
to
appear
in
court
happenned
because
weaver
was
given
an
incorrect
court
date
and
then
indicted
before
that
date
the
shootout
occurred
when
federal
agent
arthur
roderick
killed
weavers
dog
that
was
in
proximity
to
weavers
son
samuel
weaver
then
fired
in
selfdefense
in
the
ensuing
battle
federal
agent
william
degan
was
killed
when
his
gun
was
later
found
there
were
cases
nearby
and
the
gun
was
on
semiautomatic
however
agents
were
near
the
body
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
could
have
played
with
the
selectfire
this
will
have
to
be
more
fully
explained
finally
the
defense
claims
that
vicki
weaver
was
only
going
to
look
at
the
body
not
recover
of
her
son
when
she
was
cutdown
by
an
fbi
sniper
prosecution

wanted
that
confrontation
and

confrontation

the
evidence
in
this
case
is
going
to
show
that
this
is
a
case
where
randy
weaver
and
kevin
harris
are
charged
with
crimes
they
didnt
commit
in
order
to
cover
crimes
that
the
government
did
commit
gerry
spence
nice
soundbite
notes
the
idaho
statesman
claims
that
weaver
supporters
heeded
a
call
from
spence
not
to
repeat
yesterdays
protests
outside
the
courthouse
however
the
local
nbc
affiliate
again
had
footage
on
the
news
with
supporters
including
tim
again
tim
claimed
he
was
a
skinhead
who
were
ordinary
working
class
people
he
also
claimed
he
was
for
white
pride
not
white
power
outside
the
courthouse
the
television
crew
had
an
impromptu
interview
with
bo
gritz
who
charged
that
the
neonazi
protestors
are
exactly
what
the
government
wants
to
smear
randy
weaver
in
an
affiliated
article
carried
in
the
idaho
statesman
about
a
dozen
lawyers
were
among
the
or
so
people
packed
into
the
courthouse
these
lawyers
were
present
to
watch
gerry
spence
in
action
and
to
perhaps
learn
something
from
him
some
tidbits
spence
flatly
told
the
jurors
that
he
and
his
son
kent
were
volunteering
their
time
to
represent
weaver
because
they
believed
in
him
spence
during
his
opening
statement
repeatedly
walked
behind
weaver
and
placed
his
hands
on
the
defendants
shoulders
weaver
broke
down
and
cried
during
the
recounting
of
his
wifes
death
and
spence
compared
the
sawed
off
shotgun
to
driving
mph
when
the
limit
was

hi
folks
thursday
april
marked
day
of
the
trial
this
day
marked
the
first
testimony
of
the
trial
deputy
us
marshal
larry
cooper
took
the
stand
for
the
prosecution
the
short
version
is
that
his
testimony
was
consistent
with
the
opening
statements
for
the
prosecution
cooper
testified
that
he
had
arrived
in
spokane
washington
on
august
to
participate
in
a
surveillance
operation
with
five
other
deputies
near
the
weaver
cabin
the
team
was
using
night
vision
equipment
for
surveillance
and
split
up
into
two
teams
of
three
people
the
six
later
met
at
an
observation
point
above
the
cabin
after
this
deputies
cooper
william
degan
and
arthur
roderick
began
a
descent
to
scout
further
possible
surveillance
sites
cooper
told
the
court
that
roderick
threw
two
large
rocks
into
a
gully
to
see
whether
the
weaver
family
dogs
would
respond
striker
the
weavers
yellow
lab
started
toward
them
barking
loudly
roderick
led
the
three
in
a
run
from
the
area
they
ran
through
some
dense
woods
into
an
open
area
called
the
fern
field
with
the
dog
in
pursuit
by
this
time
kevin
harris
and
samuel
weaver
had
joined
the
chase
the
surveillance
team
had
reached
a
y
in
the
road
cooper
decided
that
they
should
take
cover
in
the
woods
because
otherwise
they
would
be
an
easy
target
and
might
be
shot
in
the
back
as
degan
reached
the
y
he
spotted
randy
weaver
coming
down
the
road
from
the
cabin
ahead
weaver
was
startled
but
did
not
fire
at
this
moment
striker
reached
degan
and
cooper
had
to
fend
him
off
with
his
gun
it
is
unclear
whether
this
means
he
clubbed
the
dog
or
shot
the
dog
both
cooper
and
degan
then
took
cover
in
the
woods
according
to
cooper
kevin
harris
and
samuel
weaver
continued
walking
down
the
road
apparently
not
noticing
the
two
after
they
had
passed
by
on
the
road
degan
got
up
on
one
knee
raised
his
gun
and
shouted
stop
us
marshal
harris
then
brought
the
weapon
around
at
hip
level
and
fired
he
didnt
bring
the
weapon
up
to
eye
level
i
saw
bills
arm
going
back
and
i
knew
he
had
been
hit
cooper
fired
at
harris
and
harris
went
down
cooper
then
brought
his
weapon
to
bear
on
samuel
but
did
not
fire
at
this
point
cooper
then
heard
two
shots
to
his
right
samuel
weaver
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
shots
yelled
you
son
of
a
bitch
and
ran
toward
them
cooper
then
realized
that
shots
were
coming
at
him
from
directly
ahead
so
he
fired
a
threeround
burst
at
the
cabin
at
this
point
he
then
saw
samuel
weaver
running
toward
the
cabin
when
cooper
reached
degan
he
placed
his
first
two
fingers
on
degan
carotid
artery
counted
two
or
three
beats
and
then
his
heart
stopped
shortly
thereafter
roderick
and
the
other
three
marshals
joined
him
they
then
all
heard
a
large
burst
of
gunfire
from
the
area
around
the
cabin
on
crossexamination
david
nevin
questioned
the
point
of
throwing
rocks
into
the
gulley
asking
you
wanted
to
lure
that
dog
out
so
you
could
shoot
that
dog
didnt
you
nevin
also
pointed
out
that
in
last
septembers
testimony
cooper
had
claimed
that
he
spotted
weaver
after
the
dog
had
left
him
cooper
claimed
that
he
had
gone
over
the
events
in
his
head
and
decided
that
thursdays
account
was
correct
nevin
continued
the
crossexamination
by
asking
what
cooper
would
have
done
had
an
armed
man
dressed
in
full
camouflage
jumped
out
of
the
woods
at
him
no

was
available

there

is
there

there
is

that

has

you
simpleton
so
actually
there
was

of
the

being
set
deliberately
both
testamony
by
the

and
ir
tape
showing
the
fire
being

in
places
and
the
petrochemical
soot
that
the
fire
was
giving
off
indications
of
kerosine
or
gasoline
feeding
the
fire
you
might
not
believe
or
if
you
are
totally
paranoid
or
very
skeptical
but
my
point
is
visible
to
anyone
who
watches
the

of

and
has
started
a

grill
what
are

irvineuxhcsouiucedu
they
were
subject
re

directors
statement
on

standoff
thats
the
bd
side
of
the
story
the
other
is
that
d
koresh
met
agents
at
the
door
with
a
weapon
remember
the
affidavit
indicates
that
koresh
had
spent
on
assault
weapons
in
the
past
year
and
now
we
know
that
the
bunker
adjacent
to
the
house
is
thigh
deep
with
a
million
rounds
of
ammunition
the
news
statement
was
that
there
was
worth
of
firearms
and
ammunition
no
mention
of
assault
weapons
on
the
premises
not
that
koresh
had
purchased
them
what
would
his
crime
be
if
he
had
this
averages
to
about
per
person
not
an
astronomical
number
we
dont
know
that
there
is
a
thighdeep
pile
of
a
million

we
know
that
the
fbi
says
there
is
a
pile
of
a

this
is
the
first
ive
heard
that
koresh
was
identified
as
being
at

with

oh
then
why
did
the

start
from

different

in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
the
crushed
remains
of
a
pressurized
propane
tank
were
found
in
the
ruins
of
the
bd
compound
the
key
word
is
pressurized
when
that
baby
was
crushed
the
gas
would
have
gone
all
over
the
place
and
when
ignited
would
look
just
like
the
pictures
of
the
explosion
we
saw
on
the
tv
news
ammo
doesnt
go
up
all
at
once
kind
of
like
fireworks
going
off
propane
gas
goes
off
in
a
big
fireball
gee
thats
kind
of
consistent
with
what
the
pictorial
history
shows
hmmmmm
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
remember
pressurized
gas
people
all
over
the
building
conflagration
in
less
than
a
minute
huge
explosion
gas
masks
being
worn
by
the
inhabitants
makes
a
lot
of
sense
that
very
few
of
those
on
the
inside
would
even
know
that
the
tank
was
damaged
if
they
thought
it
was
just
a
normal
fire
they
would
probably
be
trying
to
put
it
out
then
boom
the
fireball
after
that
explosion
and
concussion
i
doubt
anybody
on
the
inside
of
the
building
was
capable
of
moving
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
good
question
take
an
objective
look
at
what
happened
listen
to
the
things
that
the
fbi
said
the
bds
started
the
fire
the
bds
bodies
were
found
with
gunshot
wounds
that
are
now
being
refuted
by
the
evidence
being
recovered
seems
that
the
fbi
is
deliberately
making
statements
that
have
no
rational
basis
in
fact
and
trying
to
make
them
sound
like
fact
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
yes
i
would
still
believe
that
the
fbi
and
the
batf
were
on
a
nonstop
string
of
lies
and
halftruths
this
is
consistent
with
their
operations
on
numerous
occasions
and
as
for
the
bds
being
murderous
they
did
not
cause
any
problems
until
they
were
assaulted
by
the
batf
so
now
a
thought
experiment
for
you
if
the
batf
had
never
stormed
that
farm
would
four
agents
and
bds
be
dead
today
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
yes
that
is
how
politicians
are
elected
kind
of
scary
isnt
it
now
if
we
as
a
people
actually
held
mr
clinton
to
his
promises
instead
of
apologizing
and
denying
that
he
ever
made
them
and
actually
expected
accountability
by
our
government
i
doubt
that
debacles
like
waco
would
happen
as
often
as
they
do
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
acutally
no
the
batf
has
a
rather
checkered
history
of
staging
raids
of
this
sort
just
prior
to
the
time
when
their
budget
comes
up
for
review
oddly
enough
their
budget
was
about
to
be
reviewed
just
two
weeks
after
the
initial
raid
on
the
bds
coincidence
i
think
not
and
as
for
the
fire
what
happened
was
caused
by
the
act
of
knocking
over
walls
with
an
armored
vehicle
of
destruction
the
fbi
tried
to
convince
the
world
it
was
suicide
but
all
of
the
facts
that
are
coming
out
by
the
investigation
of
the
texas
rangers
and
medical
examiners
point
to
a
gas
explosion
and
quick
fire
that
decimated
all
of
the
occupants
of
the
building
sounds
to
me
like
a
law
enforcement
agency
that
is
trying
to
cover
its
ass
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth
vader
how
is
he
on
diabolical
laughter
does
he
look
good
in
a
cape
these
things
must
be
investigated
you
first
oh
please

you

argue

you

what

they
seem
to
disagree
in
most
important
particulars
if
anyone
has
actually
seen
news
reports
of
any
of
the
survivors
speaking
firsthand
feel
free
ot
pitch
in
i
may
have
missed
it
but
my
money
is
that
their
story
will
sound
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
case
and
not
at
all
like
case
since
neither
side
would
be
particularly
interested
in
telling
the
truth
you
have
to
weigh
the
facts
given
by
each
yourself
and
weigh
it
with
the
newsreporting
if
you
care
many
cult
members
will
probably
side
with
the
attorney
and
if
he
is
lying
change
their
stories
to
match
his
and
if
the
feds
also
lie
the
cult
members
who
become
disillusioned
will
change
their

to
match
the
feds
neither
sides
are
interested
in
the
truth
the
media
is
more
interested
but
usually
either
dont
have
the
time
to
get
it
straight
or
tie
themselves
to
the
ratings
and
deliberately
distort
for
me
though
the
black
soot
billowing
outside
the
compound
added
with
how
fast
the
fire
spread
ponted
to
someone
dousing
large
parts
of
the
compound
with
some
sort
of
gasoline
or
firestarter
i
doubt
the
feds
did
that
as
they
were
more
interested
in
arresting
vernon
the
real
unbalanced
one
at
least
the
one
that
lost
his
cool
was
vernon
so
i
figured
that
he
was
more
likely
to
do
it
after
all
he
was
jesus
being
persecuted
by
the
authorities
and
had
followers
to
hold
onto
so
made
the

he
and
his

also

felt

crazed

in

last
night
the
medical
examiner
was
on

and
was
pretty
vehement
in
denying
that
any
of
them
had
bullet
wounds
he
seemed
just
a

upset
at
the
feds
for
having
spread
that
rumor
aw
gee
he
shouldnt
be
so
hard
on
them
theyre
just
practicing
the
new
principle
of
flexible
reality
that
their
big
boss
has
implemented
before
long
i
think
all
the
kneejerk
government
apologists
are
going
to
start
getting
pretty
pissed
off
at
how
easily
they
were
misled
two
notes
of

from
texas
the
tarrant
couonty
me
who
is
doing
the
autopsies
is
well
known
for
rendering
judgements
that
are
contrary
to
the
police
view
he
presented
evidence
a
few
years
ago
that
a
man
who
police
said
was
pointing
a
gun
at
them
actually
had
his
hands
in
the
air
this
does
not
bode
well
for
the
boys
in

the
texas
dept

and
the
texas
rangers
have
no
great
love
for
the

i
have
heard
them
referred

the

totally
squeezed
out
of
the

operation
and
resented
being
left
as
traffic
cops
atf
now
has
two
strikes
against
them
finally
i
guess
that
makes
three
notes
rumour
from
waco
is
that
four
atf
agents
were
stopped
by
four
waco
police
cars
and
a

trooper
after
one
of

flashed
an

that

the

a
few
comments
from
the

davidians

seemed
to
confirm
this

one

said

that
now
she
would
have

she
actually
seemed
upset
that
she
did
not
burn
with
them

i

that
vernon
started

his

statement
on
waco
standoff
the
branch
davidians
were
not
violent
and
were
not
planning
to
start
violence
when
the
bd
compound
was
assaulted
by
the
atf
the
bd
did
fire
back
but
they
agreed
to
a
cease
fire
and
they
allowed
the
atf
to
care
for
their
wounded
the
bd
even
released
the
atf
agents
they
captured
it
is
clear
from
the
release
of
the
agents
and
allowing
the
atf
medical
attention
that
the
bd
were
not
looking
for
trouble
if
the
bd
were
violent
they
would
have
held
the
atf
agents
as
hostages
they
would
not
have
released
them
like
they
did
if
they
had
kept
the
agents
hostage
they
could
have
used
them
as
bargening
chips
for
medical
attention
etc
a
big
thing
is
being
made
of
the
bd
collection
of
weapons
but
no
one
has
shown
that
they
had
any
plans
to
use
them
it
is
also
apparent
that
the
bd
did
not
have
any
military
training
if
they
had
they
could
have
dug
bunkers
and
trenches
and
increased
their
fortifications
they
could
have
shot
out
the
lights
and
speakers
it
appears
that
the
bd
were
not
violent
they
shot
back
at
the
attacking
atf
agents
out
of
panic
there
were
shots
fired
on
the
last
day
but
they
were
in
response
to
the
fbi
attack
on
the

with

fire
flash
over
is
a
frequent
occurrence
with
indoor
fires
a
fire
will
start
small
and
in
one
location
and
heat
the
air
the
temperature
in
the
room
builds
up
and
then
everything
inflammable
in
the
room
catches
fire
at
once
this
may
have
occurred
in
the
bd
compound
i
have
heard
reports
that
the
windows
were
covered
which
would
permit
a
fire
to
start
unnoticed
by
those
outside
the
compound
when
the
fire
got
big
enough
and
broke
through
the
walls
it
appeared
to
be
started
in
two
places
but
was
really
one
big
fire
because
of
the
large
quantities
of
tear
gas
inserted
into
the
building
it
is
possible
that
many
of
the
women
and
children
were
in
a
room
free
of
tear
gas
they
would
try
to
seal
the
door
to
keep
out
the
tear
gas
when
they
learned
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
it
was
too
late
for
them
to
escape
they
were
trapped
by
the
flames
in
their
safe
room
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
fbi
was
not
recording
the
final
assault
i
think
that
they
would
have
wanted
to
have
tapes
to
show
their
agents
of
the
the
fbi
overcoming
the
forces
of
evil
aka

the

expect
at

to
have
an
awful

of
explaining

do
and
there
is
also
appears
to
be
a
trend
in

at
large
that
actively
opposes
what
many
see
as
their
right
to
defend
themselves
in
a
few
other
parts
of
our
society
handguns
are
banned
or
so
restricted
as
to
be
practically
unavailable
to
the
law
abiding
citizen
for
selfdefense
outside

funny
though
how
the
criminals
in
such
places
continue
to
have
a
lush
supply
of
guns
and
no
compunctions
about
using
them
imho
you
dont
need
to
be
either
a
political
philosopher
or
a
crime
victim
to
realize
that
theres
a
flaw

dont

your
obvious
good

be
subverted
by
insupportable
generalities
about
something
as
big
and
diverse
as
us
society
my
only
intention
was
to
comment
that
the
existence
of
suitable
weapons
of
self
defense
doesnt
mean
youll
escape
a
whole
shitload
of
trouble
should
you
be
forced
to
use
them
or
by
the
naive
hope
that
making
gun
possession
a
crime
will
give
pause
to
someone
who
would
be
a
criminal
anyway
i
made
no
such
statements
nor
do
i
have
such
a
naive
hope
or
outlook
wishing
you
peace
and
the
wherewithal
to

sophisticated

it

interests
while
at

protecting

of

as

technology
improves
doing
so
will
require
new
innovative
approaches
in
the
area
of

encryption
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of

will
allow
the

to

according
to

the

was
started
by
an

crushing
a

and
turning
over

if
there
was
a

it
was
breached
dont
you

that
there
would
be
an

further
the

have
as

reason
to
lie
as
the

medical

have
found
no

wounds
as
was

by

on

theyd
only
autopsied
one

when
this
information
was
released
i
wouldnt

though
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the

story
despite
much

to
the
contrary
the

at

what

to

and
all

that
have
been
debating
about
the

the
original

claimed
that
the
atffbi
was
pumping
napalm
into
the
building
with
the
hopes
that
the
wood
stove
inside
would
ignite
it
i
responed
with
why
would
the
wood
stove
be
lit
in
the
first
place
it
wouldnt
be
lit
for
heating
purposes
because
of
the
weather
in
texas
which
statement
is
dead
wrong
because
our
local
posters
have
confirmed
that
it
was
quite
chilly
that
morning
everyone
now
claims
that
it
was
for
cooking
no
we
argue
that
it
was
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
a
woodstove
to
be
operational
stop
and
think
about
this
cs
gas
was
being
pumped
into
the
building
and
i
presume
that
everyone
was
wearing
gas
masks
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
this
had
been
going
on
for
hours
i
dont
know
if
you
have
ever
been
around
cs
but
i
have
being
exposed
to
cs
gas
was
part
of
my
army
training
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
very
uncomfortable
and
makes
your
eyes
water
nose
run
and
makes
you
sick
in
the
stomach
and
with
the
mask
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
water
much
less
eat
so
my
question
now
is
why
were
they
cooking
food
obviously
you
missed
my
earlier
posting
about
the
physica
of

in
brief
you
cant
turn
your
woodstove
on

off
like
your

range
it
stays
on
all
the
time
it
even
stays
on
for
over
hours
after
you
shut
it
off
which
is
why
most

saying

is
much
different
from
saying
hopefully
if

it
will

here
youve
made
both

perhaps
policy

is
worthy

the

statement
is
not
something
to
base
policy
decisions

are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional

among
children
ages
and
under
according
to
groups
like
the

prevent

formerly
the
national
coalition
to
ban

interesting
name
change
dont
you
think
who
include
murder
and
suicide
by
firearms
in
the
leading
causes
of
unintentional
death
figures
but
dont
include
murder
and
suicide
by
other
means
as
causes
of
unintentional
death
cant
you
see
past
the
bullshit
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
certainly
accidental
deaths
by
any
cause
are
serious
things
but
the
antigun
groups
insist
over
and
over
again
that
accidental
death
by
firearms
is
a
stastically
serious
problem
and
even
if
you
dont
use
these
deaths
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
these
groups
do
im
sorry
if
i
jumped
to
conclusions
about
your
reason
for
mentioning
accidental
deaths
due
to
firearms
being
something
that
warranted
concern
but
in
light
of
your
statement
that
you
are
a
staunch
supporter
of
gun
control
measures
i
think
the
conclusion
was
a
reasonable
one
the
fact
remains
that
tragic
though
individual
accidental
gun
deaths
may
be
they
are
not
a
serious
problem
statistically
speaking
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
sorry
if
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
i
thought
you
were
waffling
on
your
view
of
buyback
programs
with
the
talk
of
symbolic
offerings
and
hopefully
preventing
accidents
and
heatofpassion
shootings
i
have
to
disagree
on
all
these
counts
i
cant
understand
how
a
buying
guns
from
people
who
arent
intending
to
misuse
them
obviously
those
who
want
to
use
guns
to
commit
crimes
arent
going
to
turn
them
in
could
be
construed
as
a
positive
way
for
police
to
respond
to
interpersonal
violence
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
what
the
people
who
publish
figures
saying
that
as
many
children
commit
suicide
by
handguns
alone
each
year
as
the
fbi
says
commit
suicide
by
all
methods
per
year
who
do
you
think
i
should
believe
the
people
who
call
everyone
up
to
age
children
when
theyre
screaming
about
the
carnage
of
our
nations
children
being
caused
by
handguns
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
ah
yes
the
agency
that
considers
accidental
shootings
of
children
to
be
such
a
statistical
problem
that
a
stated
objective
in
the
healthy
people
document
is
to
enact
laws
in
states
requiring
manufacturers
of
handguns
to
make
the
handguns
more
difficult
to
fire
minimizing
the
likelihood
of
accidental
or
intentional
dscharge
by
children
the
agency
that
funded
the
study
of
dc
which
pronounced
that
the
dc
gun
ban
had
saved
x
lives
yes
they
actually
gave
us
a
number
on
the
basis
of
a
look
at
the
number
of
shootings
rather
than
the
rate
of
shootings
it
wasnt
their
fault
that
the
population
of
dc
dropped
in
their
post
law
period
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
okay
ill
concede
i
no
longer
have
the
numbers
i
once
read
on
these
ill
retract
my
dispute
of
your
numbers
however
i
would
be
greatly
interested
in
seeing
how
cphv
and
cdc
came
up
with
these
numbers
the
cdc
also
says

million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come

have

reported

these
are

what
are
these

doing
with
the

they
find
with

nothing
no
criminal
prosecution
no
expulsion
in
most
cases
not
even
suspension
they
take
the

slap
the

say
aint
it
awful
and
go

as

everythings
back
to

whats
wrong
with
this

okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
i
dont
think
koresh
was
the
messiah
either
but
isnt
it
obvious
that
if
he
believed
the
forces
of
evil
were
come
to
destroy
him
then
he
believed
the
children
were
much
safer
inside
the
compound
i
didnt
say
he
was
sane
just
that
he
behaved
in
a
pretty
rational
manner
given
what
he
thought
was
going
on
he
thought
he
had
them
in
the
one
place
where
harm
wouldnt
come
to
them
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive

from

according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
if
there
was
a
large
propane
tank
and
it
was
breached
dont
you
think
that
there
would
be
an
identifiable
explosion
there
was
at
least
one
blast
consistent
with
petroleum
products
that
i
saw
however
propane
is
interesting
stuff
it
doesnt
explode
on
contact
with
air
it
is
possible
for
a
tank
to
rupture
without
exploding
far
more
likely
however
is
that
the
compound
was
equipped
with
ng
outlets
running
to
the
tank
damage
from
the
cevs
could
have
ruptured
the
gas
lines
allowing
the
gas
to
spread
unnoticed
in
the
cs
fumes
and
general
excitement
propane
typically
has
a
distinctive
odor
added
to
it
for
just
this
reason
to
smell
leaks
until
reaching
a
flame
or
spark
and
then
whooosh
fire
everywhere
and
maybe
an
explosion
use
of
ng
is
pretty
common
in
texas
especially
semirural

further
the

have
as
much

to
lie

this

so
far
the

on

is
very

i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many

their

lied
about
coming

to
the
fbi
to
his

to
just
about
everyone
i
keep
hearing
this
but
every
assertion
of
this
form
has
come
from
government
sources
except
two
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
ready
to
stipulate
that
koresh
ever
promised
to
come
out
except
for
his
first
promise
and
his
last
promise
the
first
promise
was
conditional
on
his
audio
tape
being
given
national
exposure
well
it
never
was
it
was
broadcast
locally
in
a
choppedup
fashion
and
thats
all
and
even
then
they
cleverly
cut
it
off
when
it
got
to
the
part
where
he
demanded
national
exposure
but
not
so
cleverly
that
we
didnt
hear
it
the
last
promise
was
conditional
on
the
finishing
of
his
manuscript
well
never
know
if
he
would
have
kept
that
one
the
fbi
etc
cant
wait
forever
for
koresh
to
come
out
as
long
as
they
thought
that
koreshs
intended
to
surrender
peacefully
when
they
lost
hope
in
that
they
decided
to
go
in
strangely
enough
the
previous
day
they
said
they
were
prepared
to
wait
as
long
as
it
takes
further
while
the
mondays
tactics
were
silly
and
clumsy
they
were
obviously
intended
to
drive
the
davidians
out
of
the
compound
not
to
kill
koresh
and
his
followers
quite
possible
but
arguments
of
intent
do
not
mark
the
dividing
line
between
guilt
and
innocence
only
the
line
between
murder
and
negligent
manslaughter
if
it
is
true
i
read
in
the
paper
that
the
government
listening
devices
inside
the

picked
up
orders
to
burn
the
joint
down
shortly
before
the
fire
was
started
im
waiting
to
see
what
the
tapes
really
hold
this
would
be
an
interesting
development
the

may
be
telling
the
truth
or
he
may
be
lying
to
save
his
skin
from
possible
murder
charges
resulting

koreshs
lawyer
being

evenhanded
article
on
paxton
quigley
armed

wsj
cites
the
worlds
most
notorious
statistic
regarding
guns
in
the
home
a
pioneering
study
of
residential
gunshot
deaths
in
king
county
washington
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
the
times
stat
is
everywhere
these
days
it
has
grown
in
media
lore
like
the
proverbial
urban
myth
it
was
inflated
by
one
pugilistic
talkshow
pundit
to
given
the
shock
value
of
the
finding
the
conclusion
of
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
nejm
study
is
remarkably
understated
the
advisability
of
keeping
firearms
in
the
home
for
protection
must
be
questioned
responsible
people
should
indeed
question
the
risks
and
benefits
of
bringing
a
firearm
into
their
home
but
what
we
need
to
know
is
this
what
exactly
are
the
risks
and
benefits
the
nejm
testimony
is
neither
the
whole
truth
about
the
benefits
nor
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
risks
further
as
with
motor
vehicles
we
want
to
know
what
control
do
we
have
over
the
risks
and
benefits
and
as
with
the
risks
of
cancer
or
heart
disease
or
auto
accidents
how
can
we
minimize
the
risks
like
raw
highway
death
tolls
the
nejm
stat
is
not
very
helpful
here
the
nejm
finding
purports
to
inform
us
but
it
is
framed
to
warn
us
off
it
is
widely
promulgated
in
the
media
as
a
scare
stat
a
misleading
halftruth
whose
very
formulation
is
calculated
to
prejudice
and
terrify
the
frightful
statistic
screams
for
itself
the
risks
far
outweigh
the
benefits
yes
what
fool
would
run
these
risks
if
your
car
were
times
more
likely
to
kill
you
a
loved
one
a
dear
friend
or
an
innocent
child
than
to
get
you
to
your
destination
should
you
not
take
the
bus
uncritical
citation
puts
the
good
name
of
statistics
in
the
bad
company
of
lies
and
damned
lies
surely
we
can
do
better
where
lives
are
at
stake
lets
take
a
closer
look
at
this
risky
business
the
times
stat
of
the
nejm
study
is
the
product
of
dividing
the
number
of
home
intrudersaggressors
justifiably
killed
in
selfdefense
the
divisor
into
the
number
of
family
members
or
acquaintances
killed
by
a
gun
in
the
home
the
dividend
the
divisor
of
this
risk
equation
is
in
the
studys
fiveyear
sample
there
were
intruders
and
other
cases
of
selfdefense
the
dividend
is
in
the
study
there
were
accidental
deaths
criminal
homicides
and
suicides
divided
by
yields
there
were
a
total
of
gunrelated
deaths
in
king
county
between
and
so
the
study
leaves
deaths
outside
of
homes
unaccounted
the
nejms
notorious
times
statistic
is
seriously
misleading
on
six
counts
the
dividend
is
misleadingly
characterized
in
the
media
the
or
acquaintances
of
the
study
who
include
your
friendly
drug
dealers
and
neighborhood
gang
members
is
equated
to
friends
the
implication
is
that
the
offending
guns
target
and
kill
only
beloved
family
members
dear
friends
and
innocent
children
deaths
may
all
be
equally
tragic
but
the
character
and
circumstance
of
both
victims
and
killers
are
relevant
to
the
risk
these
crucial
risk
factors
are
masked
by
the
calculated
impression
that
the
death
toll
is
generated
by
witless
waltons
shooting
dear
friends
and
friendly
neighbors
this
is
criminological
hogwash
the
study
itself
does
not
distinguish
households
or
environs
populated
by
people
with
violent
criminal
or
substanceabuse
histories
where
the
risk
of
death
is
very
high
versus
households
inhabited
by
more
civil
folk
for
example
people
who
avoid
highrisk
activities
like
drug
dealing
gang
banging
and
wife
beating
where
the
risk
is
very
low
indeed
in
actuality
negligent
adults
allow
fatal
but
avoidable
accidents
and
homicides
are
perpetrated
mostly
by
people
with
histories
of
violence
or
abuse
people
who
are
identifiably
and
certifiably
at
high
risk
for
misadventure
to
ignore
these
obvious
risk
factors
in
firearm
accidents
and
homicides
is
as
misleading
as
ignoring
the
role
of
alcohol
in
vehicular
deaths
by
tautology
neither
gun
deaths
nor
vehicular
deaths
would
occur
without
firearms
or
vehicles
but
the
person
and
circumstance
of
the
gun
owner
or
driver
crucially
affect
the
risk
one
misleading
implication
of
the
way
the
nejm
stat
is
framed
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
is
much
more
likely
to
kill
than
to
protect
and
this
obscures
indeed
disregards
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
the
typical
quotation
of
this
study
unlike
larsons
attributes
fatal
agency
to
the
gun
a
gun
in
the
home
is
times
as
likely
to
kill
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
a
major
promulgator
of
the
nejm
statistic
uses
this
particular
formulation
we
can
dispense
with
the
silly
debate
about
whether
its
people
or
guns
that
accomplish
the
killing
again
by
tautology
gun
deaths
would
not
occur
without
the
guns
the
question
begged
is
how
many
deaths
would
occur
anyway
without
the
guns
in
any
case
people
are
the
deathdealing
agents
the
guns
are
their
lethal
instruments
the
moral
core
of
the
personal
risk
factors
in
gun
deaths
are
personal
responsibility
and
choice
due
care
and
responsibility
obviate
gun
accidents
human
choice
mediates
homicide
and
suicide
by
gun
or
otherwise
the
choice
to
own
a
gun
need
not
condemn
a
person
to
nejms
highrisk
pool
the
gun
does
not
create
this
risk
by
itself
people
have
a
lot
to
say
about
what
risk
they
run
with
guns
in
their
homes
for
example
graduates
of
paxton
quigleys
personal
protection
course
do
not
run
the
touted
times
risk
any
more
than
skilled
and
sober
drivers
run
the
same
risks
of
causing
or
suffering
vehicular
death
as
do
reckless
or
drunk
drivers
undiscriminating
actuarials
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
and
choice
just
as
they
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
socioeconomic
criminological
and
other
riskrelevant
factors
in
firearmrelated
death
this
is
why
we
resent
insurance
premiums
and
actuarial
consigment
to
risk
pools
whose
norms
disregard
our
individualities
fortunately
nothing
can
consign
us
to
the
nejm
risk
pool
but
our
own
lack
of
choice
or
responsibility
in
the
matter
suicide
accounts
for
of
the
deaths
by
gun
in
the
home
in
the
nejm
study
as
against
the
total
deaths
by
gun
in
king
county
including
those
outside
the
home
inhouse
suicides
are
of
the
total
death
toll
which
is
closer
to
the
roughly
proportion
found
by
other
studies
suicide
is
a
social
problem
of
a
very
different
order
from
homicide
or
accidents
the
implication
of
the
nejm
study
is
that
these
suicides
might
not
occur
without
readily
available
guns
it
is
true
that
attempted
suicide
by
gun
is
likely
to
succeed
it
is
not
obviously
true
that
the
absence
of
a
gun
would
prevent
any
or
all
of
these
suicides
this
is
widely
assumed
or
alleged
but
the
preponderance
of
research
on
guns
and
suicide
actually
shows
otherwise
that
this
is
wishful
thinking
in
all
but
a
few
truly
impulsive
cases

if
suicides
were
removed
from
the
dividend
of
the
nejm
studys
risk
equation
the

to

the
inclusion
of
suicides
in
the
nejm
risk
equation
like
the
causes
durability
or
interdiction
of
suicidal
intent
itself
is
a
profoundly
debatable

quotations
of
the

totally
disregard
this
issue
citations
of
the
nejm
study
also
mislead
regarding
the
estimable
rate
of
justifiable
and
excusable
homicide
most
measures
like
the
nejm
homicide
rate
are
based
on
the
immediate
disposition
of
cases
but
many
homicides
initially
ruled
criminal
are
appealed
and
later
ruled
selfdefense
in
the
literature
on
battered
women

are

underrepresenting
the
rate
of
justifiable
or
excusable
homicide

of

but
only
of
the
homicides
were
reported
as
selfdefense
in
a
may
update
time
reported
that
of
the
homicides
had
eventually
been
ruled
selfdefense
in
times
sample
the
originally
reported
rate
of
selfdefense
was
in
error
by
a
factor
of
four
the
possibility
of
such
error
is
not
acknowledged
by
promulgators
of
the
nejm
statistic
while
both
the
dividend
and
the
product
of
the
nejm
risk
equation
are
arguably
inflated
the
divisor
is
unconscionably
misleading
the
divisor
of
this
equation
counts
only
aggressors
who
are
killed
not
aggressors
who
are
successfully
thwarted
without
being
killed
or
even
shot
at
the
utility
of
armed
selfdefense
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
the
harms
done
with
guns
in
homes
what
kind
of
moral
idiocy
is
it
to
measure
this
utility
only
in
terms
of
killings
do
we
measure
the
utility
of
our
police
solely
in
terms
of
felons
killed
as
opposed
to
the
many
many
more
who
are
otherwise
foiled
apprehended
or
deterred
should
we
not
celebrate
let
alone
count
those
cases
where
no
human
life
is
lost
as
successful
armed
defenses
the
question
posed
to
media
that
cite
the
nejm
scare
stat
is
this
why
neglect
the
compendious
research
on
successful
armed
defense
notably
by
criminologist
gary
kleck
point
blank
guns
and
violence
in
america
aldine
de
gruyter
klecks
estimations
of
the
rate
and
risk
of
defensive
firearm
use
are
based
on
victimization
surveys
as
well
as
other
studies
the
rate
is
high
about
one
million
a
year
and
the
risk
is
good
gun
defenders
fare
better
than
anyone
either
those
who
resort
to
other
forms
of
resistance
or
those
who
do
not
resist
dividing
one
million
gun
defenses
a
year
by
annual
gun
deaths
from
selfdefense
homicides
suicides
and
accidents
yields
thus
we
can
construct
a
much
more
favorable
statistic
than
the
nejm
scare
stat
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
defend
against
assault
or
other
crime
than
to
kill
anybody
of
course
klecks
critics
belittle
the
dividend
of
this
calculation
what
is
good
news
for
gun
defenders
is
bad
news
for
gun
control
we
should
indeed
question
the
basis
and
method
of
klecks

estimation
of
defensive
firearm
use
as
i
have
questioned
the
nejm

clearly
the
issue
of
how
to
manage
mortal
risks
is
not

by

if
a
bunch
of
people
say
it
is
for
instance
if
some
people
go
on
a
murderous
rampage
and
lynch
some
blacks
and
then
a
poll
is
taken
which
shows
that
the

people
think
that
this
is
acceptable
then
does
this
mean
that
what
these

have
done
isnt
bad
this
is
an
example
of
mob
rule
not
a

democracy

i
hope
that
ive
made
myself
clear
on
this
make
the
following
points
your
outrage
over
todays
behaviour
and
what
if
im
not
outraged
fineyou
have
the
right
to
hold
any
opinion
that
you
want
to
but
let
me
ask
you
this
are
you
outraged
over
this
tragedy
i
hope
that
you
are
your
opinions
of
david
koresh
and
his
followers
not
withstanding
i
know
i
am
since
batf
chief
higgens
and
janet
reno
were
the
who
signed
off
on
this
plan
demand
that
they
be
fired
actually
they
should
both
be
commended
why
id
be
interested
in
hearing
your
reasons
point
out
that
even
if
the
fire
was
set
by
someone
inside
of
the
building
it
came
as
a
direct
result
of
the
actions
of
the
fbibatf
and
the
people
inside
including
children
deserved
a
trial
instead
of
this
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
exactly
did
you
expect
them
to
do
i
can
see
it
nowthe

news
fbi
and
batf

still
surround
the
waco

after
days
i
dont
think
so
they
gave
them
every
chance
they
had
days
to
surrender
to
proper
authorities
they
had
attornies
representing
them
etc
koresh
lied
time
and
time
again
i
dont
wish
them
dead
but
you
cant
let
it
stalemate
forever
it
was
time
to
do
something
and
the
fbi

batf
did
what
happened
was
unfortunate
but
acceptable
as
long
as
the

didnt
set
the

just
to
shed
some
light
on
the
fire
it
was
widely
reported
ap
etc
that
there
were
several
witnesses
to
bd
folks
starting
the
fires
it
has
also
been
reported
that
the
fires
broke
out
in
several
places
at
once
which
rules
out
a
bradley
knocking
over
a
lamp
etc
as
the
cause
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
i
think
it
was
he
went
into
town
fairly
often
and
was
known
to
go
jogging
this
was
even
during
the
month
period
when
he
was
being
watched
one
wonders
why
the
batf
went
ahead
when
they
had
been
warned
according
to
an
interview
with
a
batf
agent
that
the
bd
were
expecting
them
and
why
they
had
the
media
in
tow
almost
looks
like
they
wanted
to
have
a
romp
and
a
nice
show
for
the
media
and
it
all
went
to
hell
he
was
also
never
known
to
act
violently
he
has
always
surrendered
peacefully
before
but
of
course
the
warrants
were
served
peacefully
he
has
been
tried
on
the
allegations
before
and
found
not
guilty
the
justification
for
this
mess
was
he
was
alleged
to
have
purchased
worth
of
guns
and
stuff
over
an
undetermined
time
period
last
i
heard
this
is
not
a
crime
or
indication
of
one
i
know
of
an
individual
with
that
much
value
in
guns
should
he
get
a

shootfirsttalklater

nobody
i

can
you
i
sure
cannot
also
one
cannot
be
sure
that
figure
is
not
calculated
like
the
feds
calculate
the
value
of
a
drug
siezure
even
so
it
is
a
so
what
issue
he
wasnt
bothering
anyone
besides
the
batf
who
doesnt
like
folks
other
than
themselves
or
other
govt
people
having
any
effective
guns
and
having
an
unapproved
religeous
group
are
we
required
to
not
offend
the
batf
these
days
i
sure
hope
it
hasnt
come
to
that
my
point
is
it
does
not
add
up
we
need
an
independent
investigation
and
now
assuming
other
than
fbibatf
are
preserving
the
evidence
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
they
had
the
premisis
bugged
i
am
inclined
to
think
a
further
wait
would
have
saved
lives
one
wonders
why
they
didnt
have
emergency
gear
on
hand
when
they
moved
and
why
they
didnt
turn
on
the
water
when
a
fire
was
observed
instead
of
saying
aw
gee
there
is
no
water
why
so
long
before
the
fire
gear
even
showed
up
like
after
the
building
had
pretty
much
finished
burning
fireman
safety
isnt
that
a
decision
the
firefighters
should
be
allowed
to
make
no
water
why
didnt
the
feds
turn
it
back
on
they
sure
could
cut
it
off
quickly
enough
one
does
wonder
about
the
possibility
of
settling
scores
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
what
does
taking
responsibility
mean
you
think
she
is
going
to
be
facing
jail
time
if
the
acts
were
found
to
be
criminal
you
think
she
is
going
to
face
any
repercussions
if
the
fbibatf
are
found
to
have
acted
wrongly
i
dont
it
is
a
nice
pr
gimmick
though
i
am
not
assured
there
will
even
be
a
serious
independent
investigation
for
possible
wrongdoing
or
criminal
acts
on
the
part
of
the
batf
or
fbi
i
expect
to
hear
they
are
our
best
law
enforcement
they
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
no
way
out
of
the
question
end
of
issue
i
want
to
see
an
independent
investigation
with
full
prosecuting
and
subpoena
powers
with
felony
prosecution
where
felony
acts
are
found
fat
chance
i
bet
i
bet

have

will
turn

my

girlfriend
asks
if
the

really
doesnt
care
a
hill
of
beans
about
our
religion
how
come
theyre
still
busting
us
for
it
in
oregon
washington
and
a
few
other
places
youd
be
a
christian
too
if
the
us
army
marched
you
into
church
at
gunpoint
are
you
saying
that
the
indians
who
became
christians
did
so
because
the
us
army
marched
them
into
church
at

this
will
be
news
to
the
indians
of
the
great
lakes
and
upper
mississippi
basin
of
the
southwest
of
mexico
and
south
america
who
converted
even
before
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the

are
you
saying
that
indians
are
incapable
of
coming
to
a
decision
themselves
about
their
religion
without
being
forced
to
at
gunpoint
what
about
the
christian
cherokees
who
were
given
the
boot
by
the
us
government
after
the
civil
war
because
the
cherokee
nation
gave
mild
support
to
the
confederacy
since
they
themselves
owned
black
slaves
no
reducing
it
all
to
a
matter
of

is
to
support
a
much
too
narrow
view
of
history
ive
never
heard

a

whether
broken

not

not
that

you
guys
convert

christianity
you
get
to
keep
all
the

you
claim
no
treaties
were
invariably
about

it
meant
ceding

sometimes

what

some

i
believe
the

made
were
right

i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the

on

tonight
as
well
as

i
question
some
of

could
it

been

have
taken

were

blaring

the

of

i

it
contributed

folks
that
are

tend
not

a

other
questions

i

i
believe
the

i
still

and
i
suppose
the

also
prevented
them
from
coming

their

up

national

watch
watch

two

far
enough

whatever
really
happenned
must
be

please
tell

what
you
think
would
have
happened
had
the
people
come
out
with
their

up
several
weeks
ago
it
didnt
happen
and
who
is
responsible
for
it
not
happening
certainly
not
the
children
koresh
was
calling
the
shots
he
was
talking
with
his
lawyer
and
the
fbi
since
others
were
released
safely
there
is
no
sane
reason
for
keeping
the
children
inside
the
compound
the
fbi
and
koresh
were
calling
the
shots
and
there
were
very
sane
reasons
for
keeping
the
children
if
they
let
them
go
the
parents
would
never
see
them
again
that
is
not
an
easy
choice
in
spite
of
you
cold
attitude
about
it
scenario
that
is
simplest
and
most
plausible
i
do
not
generally
believe
in
conspiracy
theories
that
involve
complicated
and
unlikely
scenarios
the
fbi
sent
letters
to
martin
luther
kings
wife
insinuating
that
mlk
was
having
an
affair
again
please
tell
us
exactly
how
much
you
trust
our
supposedly
benevolent
government
more
than
someone
who
would
not
release
children
from
the
compound
obviously
you
are
an
authority
worshiper
not
at
all
are
you
a
koresh
worshiper
i
am
a
constitution
worshiper
you
quite
obviously
eat
anything
the
authorities
feed
you
without
doubt
which
makes
you
no
different
that
a
koresh
worshiper

more

i
saw
lengthy
excerpts
from
an
australian
documentary
made
in
that
clearly
showed
that
this
was
a
cult
give
me
a
camera
and
time
with
you
and
i
can
present
excerpts
that
show
you
to
be
a
cult
leader
guarenteed
thanks
for
my
laugh
of
the
day
definitely
a
very
silly
supposition
if
you
do
not
believe
this
you
are
truly
naive
it
is
not
only
possible
it
is
easy
i
worked
in
the
broadcast
profession
at
a
network
station
in
the
late
i
know
what
im
saying
here
embarrasing
footage
is
easy
to
get
add
a
little
sinister
music
and
the
right
voiceover
and
ill
have
you
mother
agreeing
to
commit
you
you
should
at
least
view
the
whole
documentary
before
you
claim
it
as
a
source
i
would
if
i
could
the
news
show
that
showed
the
lengthy
excerpts
also
had
interviews
with
the
filmmaker
who
made
the
documentary
who
basically
confirmed
what
was
shown
in
the
excerpts
from
the
time
he
spent
at
the
compound
in
the
news
shows
were
looking
for
excerpts
which
backed
their
position
do
you
think
they
would
show
excerpts
which
disproved
their
points
i
am
not
pleased
with
the
batf
handling
of
the
affair
i
think
they
bungled
it
badly
from
the
start
but
i
dont
think
they
are
responsible
for
the
fire
which
started
in
two
different
places
two
places
eh
you
saw
this
or
did
the
wonderful
fbi
tell
you
this
i
saw
one
place
i
believe
that
this
was
reported
by
local
radio
reporters
on
site
a
fire
started
in
a
three
story
tower
at
the
same
time
as
the
two
story
window
shown
on
the
tv
coverage
the
reports
of
multistarts
came
solely
from
the
fbi
anyone
observing
the
fire
from
the
available
video
would
be
hard
pressed
to
see
more
than
one
point
of
fire
which
spread
across
the
compound
as
a
uniform
rate
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
i
suspect
that
there
were
plenty
of
camerapeople
willing
to
risk
small
arms
fire
to
get
some
good
footage
these
people
were
told
to
get
the
hell
out
of
camera
range
why
couldnt
answer
this
one
eh
this
is
the
most
important
question
of
all
it
is
the
root
cause
of
all
the
other
suspicion
i
thought
about
mentioning
how
reagan
and
the
military
treated
the
press
in
grenada
and
how
that
set
the
precedent
but
decided
it
wasnt
worthy
of
discussion
if
the
news
reporter
got
shot
you
can
bet
his
family
would
sue
the
government
for
letting
him
into
the
danger
area
no
reported
has
ever
sued
the
government
for
such
a
situation
they
know
the
dangers
remember
the
batf
invited
the
initial
coverage
and
how
about
a
simple
remotecontrolled
camera
or
two
there
were
ways
to
provide
media
access
the
fbi
obviously
just
didnt
want
any
the
root
cause
of
suspicion
in
my
mind
is
why
people
wouldnt
flee
a
building
that
had
numerous
exits
during
the
minutes
time
it
took
to
burn
down
or
why
didnt
they
flee
hours
earlier
when
the
tear
gas
was
first
introduced
i
can
find
no
rational
explanation
for
their
behavior
i
can
find
several
tear
gas
and
smoke
making
it
impossible
to
remove
the
barricades
flames
blocking
exits
to
the
saferooms
perhaps
the
gun
shots
were
from
the
fbi
keeping
them
pinned
in

even

mr
roby
you
are
a
government
sucking
heartless
bastard
unworthy
of
comment
but
apparently
true
my
opinion
only
of
course
so
your
opinion
is
truth
i
see
still
mastering
the
language
eh
notice
the
use
of
apparently
humans
died
yesterday
humans
who
would
not
have
died
if
the
fbi
had
not
taken
the
actions
they
did
that
is
the
undeniable
truth
i
cried
for
them
nor
would
they
have
died
if
they
had
come
out
with
their
hands
empty
that
is
undeniable
truth
no
it
is
not
it
is
possible
the
fbi
planned
for
this
to
happen
and
the
gunfire
heard
was
the
fbi
keeping
the
folks
inside
im
not
proposing
this
as
the
way
it
went
down
but
just
to
point
out
that
its
not
undeniable
that
if
they
walked
out
yesterday
they
would
be
alive
today
you
can
believe
that
if
you
wish
it
is
undeniable
however
that
people
have
left
the
compound
unharmed
and
alive
earier
in
the
standoff
and
since
their
leader
was
preaching
that
they
would
have
an
apocalypse
you
can
not
say
undeniably
that
there
wouldnt
have
been
a
mass
suicide
if
the
fbi
had
simply
stayed
outside
and
waited
another
days
im
not
denying
that
at
all
but
every
day
is
another
chance
for
a
good
ending
why
push
it
mr
roby
you
are
going
to
die
anyway
why
not
today
every
moment
of
life
is
precious
my
heart
bleeds
just
as
much
as
yours
for
the
children
who
were
never
released
given
days
of
ample
opportunities
to
do
so
my
heart
also
bleeds
for
people
so
blinded
by
religious
devotion
to
not
have
the
common
sense
to
leave
the
compound
when
tanks
came
up
and
started
dropping
in
tear
gas
early
in
the
morning
my
heart
bleeds
for
no
one
you
are
the
bleeding
heart
and
im
sure
beyond
any
possible
doubt
that
you
do
not
feel
for
those
people
as
i
do
you
can
not
say
the
heartless
things
you
have
said
if
you
did
i
am
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
you
are
not
making
sense
no
you
are
the
heartless
bleeding
heart
a
flaming
liberal
who
cares
deeply
who
feels
your
pain
you
seem
to
have
no
concern
that
someone
would
keep
children
inside
this
compound
when
they
had
days
to
let
them
out
that
sounds
pretty
heartless
to
me
you
have
continually
raised
this
issue
without
any
understanding
of
the
bonds
between
parent
and
child
it
is
not
easy
to
say
a
final
goodbye
to
your
children
i
do
not
think
i
could
do
it
either
if
that
makes
me
heartless
so
be
it
how
many
children
do
you
have
i
have
three
i
just
heard
on
the
news
that
some
of
the
survivors
regret
they
hadnt
stayed
in
the
inferno
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
koresh
this
makes
me
sad
and
sick
it
just
makes
me
sad
i
never
claimed
koresh
was
an
angel
you
seem
to
say
they
got
what
they
deserved
i
do
not
think
this
however
if
they
did
set
the
fire
which
started
in
more
than
one
place
and
spread
very
quickly
then
they
got
what
they
wanted
and
put
into
motion
themselves
they
got
what
they
wanted
what
kind
of
creature
are
you
that
you
can
believe
this
have
you
ever
heard
of
jonestown
the
sad
thing
is
the
people
inside
the
compound
were
the
authority
worshipers
and
their
only
authority
was
koreshhowell
if
these
people
were
able
to
think
for
themselves
there
would
likely
be
a
lot
more
survivors
today
koresh
preached
a
fiery
apocalypse
as
early
as
last
year
i
made
the
same
authority
worshiper
point
about
you
a
few
lines
back
and
once
again
jonestown
however
sick
it
was
was
doing
ok
until
the
authorities
showed
up
and
pushed
a
fragile
person
over
the
edge
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
i
see
the
batf
is
going
to
be
investigated
by
the
justice
dept
and
likely
by
arlen
spectre
and
congress
this
is
good
they
have
bungled
the
affair
from
the
start
we
agree
on
this
now
lets
have
your
god
the
fbi
investigated
too
by
all
means
the
fbi
should
be
investigated

then
they

the

is

more

then
ever
if
they
blast
away
a

good

then
that
is
with

they
needed

power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a
few
i
hope
this
is
a
joke
if
not
heres
my
response
the
batf
has
a
history
of
noknock
raids
with
poor
evidence
often
resulting
in
innocent
people
being
killed
or
suffering
injury
to
person
or
property
i
will
not
support
the
batf
until
they
clean
up
their
act
maybe
as
to
equipment
the
batf
has
damn
near
anything
it
wants
their
faults
were
in
intelligence
military
and
civilian
definitions
apply
tactics
attacking
during
daylight
methodology
the
fbi
stated
that
it
is
against
government
policy
to
assault
a
position
where
there
are
noncombatantspotential
hostages
without
attempting
negotiations
first
and
legality
the
batfs
jurisdiction
is
taxes
on
firearms
and
tobacco
they
are
a
branch
of
the
department
of
the
treasury
they
have
very
curiously
backed
away
from
their
claims
of
illegal
weaponry
to
push
the
childabuse
charges
the
batf
has
no
jurisdiction
over
nonfirearmstobacco
issues
and
the
charges
of
childabuse
had
been
investigated
in
the
past
with
no
violence
and
no
validation
this
was
a
clear
case
of
first
the
batf
then
the
fbi
having
watched
too
many
rambo
movies
my
opinion
is
that
the
agent
in
charge
should
be
charged
with
executing
an
illegal
raid
criminal
negligence
murder
civil
rights
violations
and
breaking
hisher
oath
to
uphold
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
us
the
warrant
should
be
unsealed
to
reveal
to
the
public
what
justification
the
batf
thought
it
had
in
committing
an
armed
assault
on
american
citizens
and
while
on
the
issue
of
investigating
this
issue
the
randy
weaver
case
and
the
johnny
lawmaster
case
should
be
investigated
for
batf
wrongdoing
james

if

fact
regardless
of

are

pushing

the

is
a
catchy

but
im
personally
waiting

see
what
the

have
to

about

all
before
i
pass
judgment
why
dont
you
do
the

some
more
interesting
facts
about
the

the
original

was
conducted
by
batf

wearing

assorted

i
saw
on

at

three

i
would

officers
of

even
if
they
were
claiming
to
be

the
batf
has
been
lying
from
the
beginning
we
only
had
handguns
the
original

showed
batf

on

getting
shot
at

submachine

we
were

submachine

are
the
best

weapon
you
cant
be

when
you
have
the
best
guns
available
for

we
didnt
know
they
had
guns
that
would
shoot
through
doors
this
one
is
the
best
there
are
very
few
guns
that
wont
shoot
through
a
household
door
or
through
a
house
wall
for
that
matter
since
officers
from
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco

should
know
that
they
are
either
lying
or
incredibly
incompetent
not

the

has
changed
daily

their

were
getting
increasingly
outrageous
throughout

the

one
of

concerns
was
that

now
they
are

thats
what

did

that
they
are

all

the

the

seemed
to
spread
too
quickly
even
given
the
nature
of
the

i

in

it

puts

back
to

it

did
it

some
other
screw
up
occured
which
is
quite
possible
the
problem
with
the
fbi
as
a
monolithic
entity
doing
it
is
that
it
requires
everybody
involved
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
while
they
tended
to
behave
like
total
idiots
that
does
not
make
them
homocidal
maniacs
either
and
if
it
was

agent
then
it
serves
no
purpose
to
blame
the
whole
agency
i
can
believe
that
a
real
nutcase
like
a
koresh
would
start
such
a
fire
but
im
far
from
convinced
he
actually
did

how

there

where
a

engaged
in

with

the
grand

on

a

used
an

the

tried

made

pissing

its

drawbacks
like
when

told
him
this

stepping
over

this
could
get
dangerous
for
you
whereupon
the
few
black
oak
park
police
officers
watched
over
his

that
the

american
and
european
universities
were
full
of
angry
young
peopletm
that
wanted
to
overthrow
the
government
and
wouldnt
think
twice
about
lobbing
a
molotov
cocktail
at
the
national
guard
military
police
in
europe
certainly
it
would
have
been
very
bad
form
to
take
anything
the
systemtm
said
at
face
value
this
was
in
the
end
of
the
sixties
and
the
begining
of
the
seventies
im
told
i
was
too
young
to
remember
something
wrong
happened
along
the
way
im
afraid
maybe
the
west
became
just
too
comfortable
or
maybe
i
was
born
too
late
yours
disappointed
with
with
the
youth
of
today
isnt
it
ironic
im
of
that
generation
and
i
remember
the
lesson
i
cry
to
see
all
the
postings
from
domestic
edu
sites
that
have
naively
swallowed
everything
the
government
has
seen
fit
to
feed
to
them
especially
contrasted
to
such
a
post
from
the
uk
yet
there
is
a
difference
between
lining
up
people
against
the
wall
and
executing
them
and
causing
their
deaths
through
negligence
imcompetence
i
honestly
hope
we
witnessed
the
latter
as
they
say
the
alternative
is
too
horrible
to
contemplate
i
suspect
we
saw
the
latter
however
the
injustice
implied
in
letting
those
involved
escape
without
investigation
andor
prosecution
is
also
horrible
to
contemplate

now
youre

there

but
the
two
you
are
concerned
with
are
and
there
are
subdirectories
to
the
rkba
directory
those
are
discussed
below
when
you
login
to
the
system
your
directory
is
to
retreive
files
change
your
current
directory
to
the
rkba
directory
with
the

cd

and
some

fields
which
you
do
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
to
get
a
file
run
the
command
get
followed
by
the
name
of
the
file
you
want
for
example
get

or
get
noduty
after
the
file
is
transfered
to
your
machine
a
message
like
this
transfer
complete
bytes
received
in
seconds
kbytess
you
can
repeat
the
get
command
for
every
file
you
want
to
retreive
you
can
use
the
mget
command
to
retreive
multiple
files
if
the
file
you
want
is
in
a
subdirectory
for
example
you
should
change
your
directory
to
the
appropriate
subdirectory
first
and
then
retrieve
it
cd
get
once
youre
finished
you
can
log
off
with
the
command
quit
if
you
have
a
file
you
want
to
contribute
the
procedure
is
a
little
different
first
of
all
you
should
find
out
if
the
file
already
exists
so
get
a
copy
of
the
index
file
with
the
procedure
above
and
look
it
over
to
make
sure
you
wouldnt
repeat
an

the

may
have
to
be
renamed
if
there
is

by

once

send

re
riddle
me
this
on
the
subject
of
cscntear
gas
when
i
received
my
initial
introduction
to
tear
gas
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
the
location
of
the
exit
if
there
had
been
anything
in
the
way
corners
to
negotiate
doors
to
open
or
any
other
obstacles
to
movement
i
would
have
had
a
difficult
time
exiting
the
chamber
and
any
concentration
of
tear
gas
is
hazardous
to
individuals
with
respiratory
problems
and
the
wearing
of
soft
contact
lenses
in
a
tear
gas
contaminated
area
is
considered
a
real
bad
idea
so
hoping
the
bds
would
peaceably
come
strolling
out
the
door
after
being
gassed
is
a
bit
unrealistic
if
they
could
have
found
the
door
having
them
staggering
out
retching
wouldnt
be
too
far
fetched
throw
in
the
factor
of
days
of
being
under
siege
and
subject
to
psychological
warfare

first
i
would
like
to
say
how
much
i
appreciate
having
so
literate
and
erudite
an
individual
as
mr
rutledge
with
whom
to
discuss
this
topic
frankly
most
antirkba
posters
refuse
even
to
approach
the
topic
of
the
original
understanding
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
detailed
in
the
writings
of
the
era
this
is
most
refreshing
second
i
must
apologize
for
leaving
the
discussion
for
several
days
my
brigades
quarterly
drill
was
this
weekend
and
i
needed
to
attend
to
several
matters
pertaining
to
the
state
militia
some
people
seem
to
feel
that
the
concept
of
the
militia
is
an
anachro
nism
that
is
out
of
place
in
the
century
im
not
sure
the
swiss
would
agree
and
i
think
perhaps
a
discussion
of
how
the
militia
both
organized
and
unorganized
fits
into
the
defense
plans
of
my
state
mississippi
please
do
not
assume
that
this
describes
something
peculiar
to
one
southern
state
for
instance
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
has
a
well
organized
militia
which
members
report
maintains
stocks
of
both
riot
guns
and
machine
guns
the
laws
of
other
states
will
vary
but
are
probably
similar
it
appears
it
is
time
that
this
article
originally
posted
by
larry
cipriani
last
year
and
which
i
saved
gets
posted
again
it
offers
as
good
an
analysis
of
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
especially
regarding
the
militia
clause
as
i
have
seen
i

if
you
wanted

all
about
the

youd
ring
up
carl

and
if
you
wanted
to
know
about

the
man
to
call
would
be
norman
schwarzkopf
no
question
about
it
but
who
would
you
call
if
you
wanted
the
top
expert
on
american
usage
to
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
that
was
the
question
i
asked
ac
brocki
editorial
coordinator
of
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
and
formerly
senior
editor
at
houghton
mifflin
publishers
who
himself
had
been
recommended
to
me
as
the
foremost
expert
on
english
usage
in
the
los
angeles
school
system
mr
brocki
told
me
to
get
in
touch
with
roy
copperud
a
retired
professor
journalism
at
the
university
of
southern
california
and
the
author
of
american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
a
little
research
lent
support
to
brockis
opinion
of
professor
copperuds
expertise
roy
copperud
was
a
newspaper
writer
on
major
dailies
for
over
three
decades
before
embarking
on
a
a
distinguished
career
teaching
journalism
at
usc
since
copperud
has
been
writing
a
column
dealing
with
the
professional
aspects
of
journalism
for
editor
and
publisher
a
weekly
magazine
focusing
on
the
journalism
field
hes
on

dictionary
frequently
cites
him
as
an

copperuds
fifth

on

american
usage
and

the

has
been
in
continuous
print
from
van
nostrand
reinhold
since
and
is
the
winner
of
the
association
of
american
publishers
humanities
award
that
sounds
like
an
expert
to
me
after
a
brief
telephone
call
to
professor
copperud
in
which
i
introduced
myself
but
did
not
give
him
any
indication
of
why
i
was
interested
i
sent
the
following
letter
i
am
writing
you
to
ask
you
for
your
professional
opinion
as
an
expert
in
english
usage
to
analyze
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
extract
the
intent
from
the
text
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
is
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
for
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
the
debate
over
this
amendment
has
been
whether
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
restrictive
clause
or
a
subordinate
clause
with
respect
to
the
independent
clause
containing
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
i
would
request
that
your
analysis
of
this
sentence
not
take
into
consideration
issues
of
political
impact
or
public
policy
but
be
restricted
entirely
to
a
linguistic
analysis
of
its
meaning
and
intent
further
since
your
professional
analysis
will
likely
become
part
of
litigation
regarding
the
consequences
of
the
second
amendment
i
ask
that
whatever
analysis
you
make
be
a
professional
opinion
that
you
would
be
willing
to
stand
behind
with
your
reputation
and
even
be
willing
to
testify
under
oath
to
support
if
necessary
my
letter
framed
several
questions
about
the
test
of
the
second
amendment
then
concluded
i
realize
that
i
am
asking
you
to
take
on
a
major
responsibility
and
task
with
this
letter
i
am
doing
so
because
as
a
citizen
i
believe
it
is
vitally
important
to
extract
the
actual
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
while
i
ask
that
your
analysis
not
be
affected
by
the
political
importance
of
its
results
i
ask
that
you
do
this
because
of
that
importance
after
several
more
letters
and
phone
calls
in
which
we
discussed
terms
for
his
doing
such
an
analysis
but
in
which
we
never
discussed
either
of
our
opinions
regarding
the
second
amendment
gun
control
or
any
other
political
subject
professor
copperud
sent
me
the
follow
analysis
into
which
i
have
inserted
my
questions
for
the
sake
of
clarity
copperud
the
words
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
contrary
to
the
interpretation
cited
in
your
letter
of
july
constitutes
a
present
participle
rather
than
a
clause
it
is
used
as
an
adjective
modifying
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
subject
the
right
verb
shall
the
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
asserted
as
an
essential
for
maintaining
a
militia
in
reply
to
your
numbered
questions
schulman
can
the
sentence
be
interpreted
to
grant
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
solely
to
a
wellregulated
militia
copperud
the
sentence
does
not
restrict
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
nor
does
it
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
elsewhere
or
by
others
than
the
people
it
simply
makes
a
positive
statement
with
respect
to
a
right
of
the
people
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
granted
by
the
words
of
the
second
amendment
or
does
the
second
amendment
assume
a
preexisting
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
merely
state
that
such
right
shall
not
be
infringed
copperud
the
right
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
its
existence
is
assumed
the
thrust
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
right
shall
be
preserved
inviolate
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
a
militia
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
conditioned
upon
whether
or
not
a
well
regulated
militia
is
in
fact
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
and
if
that
condition
is
not
existing
is
the
statement
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
null
and
void
copperud
no
such
condition
is
expressed
or
implied
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
not
said
by
the
amendment
to
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
militia
no
condition
is
stated
or
implied
as
to
the
relation
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
as
a
requisite
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
deemed
unconditional
by
the
entire
sentence
schulman
does
the
clause
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
grant
a
right
to
the
government
to
place
conditions
on
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
or
is
such
right
deemed
unconditional
by
the
meaning
of
the
entire
sentence
copperud
the
right
is
assumed
to
exist
and
to
be
unconditional
as
previously
stated
it
is
invoked
here
specifically
for
the
sake
of
the
militia
schulman
which
of
the
following
does
the
phrase
wellregulated
militia
mean
wellequipped
wellorganized
welldrilled
welleducated
or
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
copperud
the
phrase
means
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
this
accords
with
the
desire
of
the
writers
for
civilian
control
over
the
military
schulman
if
at
all
possible
i
would
ask
you
to
take
account
the
changed
meanings
of
words
or
usage
since
that
sentence
was
written
years
ago
but
not
take
into
account
historical
interpretations
of
the
intents
of
the
authors
unless
those
issues
can
be
clearly
separated
copperud
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
words
or
in
usage
that
would
affect
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
if
it
were
written
today
it
might
be
put
since
a
wellregulated
militia
is
necessary
tot
he
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
abridged
schulman
as
a
scientific
control
on
this
analysis
i
would
also
appreciate
it
if
you
could
compare
your
analysis
of
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
following
sentence
a
wellschooled
electorate
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
shall
not
be
infringed
my
questions
for
the
usage
analysis
of
this
sentence
would
be
is
the
grammatical
structure
and
usage
of
this
sentence
and
the
way
the
words
modify
each
other
identical
to
the
second
amendments
sentence
and
could
this
sentence
be
interpreted
to
restrict
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
only
to
a
welleducated
electorate
for
example
registered
voters
with
a
highschool
diploma
copperud
your
scientific
control
sentence
precisely
parallels
the
amendment
in
grammatical
structure
there
is
nothing
in
your
sentence
that
either
indicates
or
implies
the
possibility
of
a
restricted
interpretation
professor
copperud
had
only
one
additional
comment
which
he
placed
in
his
cover
letter
with
wellknown
human
curiosity
i
made
some
speculative
efforts
to
decide
how
the
material
might
be
used
but
was
unable
to
reach
any
conclusion
so
now
we
have
been
told
by
one
of
the
top
experts
on
american
usage
what
many
knew
all
along
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unconditionally
protects
the
peoples
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
forbidding
all
governments
formed
under
the
constitution
from
abridging
that
right
as
i
write
this
the
attempted
coup
against
constitutional
government
in
the
soviet
union
has
failed
apparently
because
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
be
free
from
capricious
tyranny
is
stronger
than
the
old
guards
desire
to
maintain
a
monopoly
on
dictatorial
power
and
here
in
the
united
states
elected
lawmakers
judges
and
appointed
officials
who
are
pledged
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
ignore
marginalize
or
prevaricate
about
the
second
amendment
routinely
american
citizens
are
put
in
american
prisons
for
carrying
arms
owning
arms
of
forbidden
sorts
or
failing
to
satisfy
bureaucratic
requirements
regarding
the
owning
and
carrying
of
firearms
all
of
which
is
an
abridgement
of
the
unconditional
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
even
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
staunch
defender
of
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
stands
by
and
does
nothing
it
seems
it
is
up
to
those
who
believe
in
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
preserve
that
right
no
one
else
will
no
one
else
can
will
we
beg
our
elected
representatives
not
to
take
away
our
rights
and
continue
regarding
them
as
representing
us
if
they
do
will
we
continue
obeying
judges
who
decide
that
the
second
amendment
doesnt
mean
what
it
says
it
means
but
means
whatever
they
say
it
means
in
their
orwellian
doublespeak
or
will
be
simply
keep
and
bear
the
arms
of
our
choice
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
promises
us
we
can
and
pledge
that
we
will
defend
that
promise
with

the

we

this

this

any

either
some

guns
n

most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
same
here
convicted
felons
may
not
legally
purchase
firearms
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
that
you
know
of
while
i
lived
in
the

a
gang
robbed
a
joint
us
armybundewehr
armoury
and
got
several
hundred
ammunition
handguns
and
some
explosives
when
i
left
two
years
later
there
were
no
clues
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
someone
said
that
if
we
ban
guns
wed
have
to
ban
cars
to
because
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argue
on
this
one
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
who
uses
them
is
the
problem
crime
in
the
us
is
no
big
deal
if
you
are
the
criminal
how
about
years
for
murder
credit
for
time
served
in
jail
waiting
for
trial
and
you
are
out
in
months
worst
case
if
we
would
put
criminals
especially
violent
ones
in
the
slam
for
true
sentences
crime
would
drop
instead
we
reward
them
for
being
good
and
let
them
out
early
very
early
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
serbs
croats
and
muslims
have
been
killing
each
other
almost
since
before
the
invention
of
guns
old
women
are
throwing
stones
at
un
trucks
this
is
a
hatred
that
goes
beyond
reason
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
yes
the
problem
is
the
user
question
back
since
you
are
one
of
the
rational
ones
if
all
gun
crime
were
to
stop
would
you
support
dropping
all
gun
controls
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
they
did
not
believe
from
experience
that
the
police
including
national
guard
couldwould
protect
them
unless
you
want
to
argue
that
a
human
being
does
not
have
a
right
to
protect
himherself
they
did
the
right
thing
what
would
you
suggest
as
a
defense
against
a
mob
throwing
bottles
and
rocks
and
also
likely
armed
with
stolen
firearms
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
criminals
would
move
to
scandinavia
the
average
criminal
would
look
for
a
less
hazardous
job
and
the
rest
would
likely
be
buried
at
county
expense
dont
flame
the
englishmen
because
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
works
in
england
and
fonds
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reasons
why
ira
can
bomb
innocents
something
about
throwing
stones
in
glass
houses
personally
i
criticize
the
fools
who
send

to
the

to
make
ireland
free
of

this
is
the
last
thing
the
ira
wants
because
they
lose

if

pulls

thats
for

dont

no
no

i

kratz
can
accurately
distinguish
from
semiauto
lookalikes
i
should
have
also
included
some
semiauto

guns
in
my
list
to
see
if
hed
ask
how
to
distinguish
them
from
their
nonexistent
fullauto
relatives
lets
do
the
former
now
kratz
has
claimed
that
he
can
visually
distinguish
fullautos
from
semiautos
for
which
fullautos
is
he
making
that
claim
how
does
he
do
it
lets
get
specific
and
as
exhaustive
as
possible
maybe
i
remember
there
being
a
selector
swtich
on
the
if
i
remember
correctly
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
position
or
an
on
position
because
the
gun
is
semiautomatic
wouldnt
the
have
a
position
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
maybe
round
bursts
maybe
why
is
kratz
asking
about
what
he
told
us
that
he
knows
is
kratz
certain
that
he
can
distinguish
a
three
position
switch
from
a
two
position
switch
via
tv
inspection
does
he
even
get
to
see
the
switch
in
the
typical
police
display
of
guns
note
that
one
might
well
be
able
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
in
a
hands
on
visual
inspection
even
though
it
wont
be
seen
on
tv
and
to
think
that
kratz
was
telling
us
that
seeing
it
on
tv
was
just
as
accurate
as
being
there
how
about
the
other
guns
do
they
also
have
selector
switch
to
switch
between
semiauto
and
fullyauto
fire
why
all
the
questions
kratz
assured
us
that
he
could
make
this
distinction
and
now
hes
asking
us
how
he
did
it
well
what
about
what
i
said
above
if
that
is
correct
i

would
be

if
you

under

dont

how
the

guns
dont

accidents
what
is
the

i

accidental

accidental

gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
providing
false
hope
then
is
the
intent
jim
im
just
saying
how
it
is
im
not
saying
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
from
the
police
who
i
have
talked
with
who
run
some
of
these
gun
buyback
programs
i
get
the
impression
that
they
really
think
they
are
having
an
impact
on
the
community
when
i
ask
them
if
they
have
an
evaluatory
component
to
the
program
they
say
well
no
so
in
answer
to
your
question
no
false
hope
is
not
the
intent
i
think
the
intent
is
to
show
folks
that
police
are
attempting
to
do
something
to
curb
interpersonal
gun
violence
whether
its
effective
or
not
look
if
you
cant
measure
the
impact
of
these
programs
using
some
sort
of
pretest
and
posttest
evaluation
what
is
the
point
it
must
be
symbolic
in
nature
the
police
are
essentially
saying
look
if
you
have
a
gun
lying
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for
itbecause
we
care
about
the
community
if
you
i
and
joe
could
think
of
a
way
to
measure
the
effectiveness
or
ineffectiveness
of
these
programs
we
could
become
rich
and
famous
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in

amd
these
are
the
statistics
increase
in

eh
gun
control
is
working
fine
there
i
didnt
anything
about
gun
control
what
are
you
talking
about
thus
willing
to
follow
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive
thanks
for
the
reality
check
joe
its
been
real
so
your
religion
is
different
does
that
make
it
his
wrong
even
assuming
koresh
actually
made
that
decision
and
the
verdict
is
still
out
on
that
jim
listen
to
me
i
said
im
not
religious
whatsoever
do
you
understand
religion
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
could
care
less
what
religion
they
were
okay
to
put
children
in
that
situation
is
wrong
pure
and
simple
difference
is
good
jim
i
am
the
most
progressive
and
diverse
person
in
the
world
but
if
different
is
allowing
kids
to
be
exposed
to
tanks
and
teargas
then
yes
jim
different
is
wrong

waco
questions
folks
its
time
to
start
building
some
precise
questions
to
send
to
our
federal
elected
officials
and
to
investigative
reporters
in
our
local
tv
radio
and
newprint
media
ideally
these
questions
could
be
asked
at
any
investigation
into
the
batfs
and
fbis
participation
at
the
waco
fiasco
in
hopes
of
being
resolved
and
hopefully
wake
up
the
local
news
media
that
they
are
not
getting
the
entire
truth
from
the
batf
and
fbi
my
list
is
up
to
that
are
really
nagging
at
my
gut
the
list
will
probably
grow
what
were
the
contents
of
the
original
warrant
now
sealed
that
the
batf
obtained
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
illegal
firearms
andor
ammunition
could
not
be
flushed
down
the
toilet
therefore
a
noknock
raid
could
be
ruled
out
prior
to
the
initial
assault
on
the
complex
did
a
single
batf
agent
and
accompanying

without
a

of

attempt
to
knock
on
the

of

and
serve
the

in
a
manner
prescribed
by
law
on
the
day
of
the
initial
assault
on
the

batf
agents
were
aware
that
several
small
children
were
inside
the
buildings
in
the
ensueing
gun
battle
batf
agents
fired
into
a
building
known
to
contain
children
killing
at
least
one
twoyear
old
child
knowing
children
were
present
why
didnt
the
batf
have
an
alternate
plan
and
immediately
retreat
from
the
area
close
to
the
complex
and
implement
the
alternate
plan
rather
than
opening
fire
and
jeopardizing
the
lives
of
the
children
in

fbi
spokesman
states
that
paper
evidence
indicates
that
david

possessed

did
david

were
they
actively
participating
in

of

and
were
any

possessed
does
this

consist
only
of

purchased
or
does
it
include
legally
dispossessed

stated
we
were

yet
tv
newscasts
of

filmed
at
the
time
of
the

show
batf
agents
armed
with
and

although
unclear
on
the

because
of
obstruction
from
full
view
by
agents
bodies
they
also
may
have
had
and
sks

what
types
of
firearms
did
the
batf
agents
have
immediate
access
to
at
the
scene
of
the
original
assault
on
the
complex
since
there
is
no
evidence
to
confirm
anyone
was
inside
the
complex
involuntarily
why
did
the
fbi
treat
it
as
a
hostage
situation
along
the
same
lines
why
did
the
fbi
use
psychological
warfare
techniques
including
sensory
overload
sleep
deprivation
and
other
disruptive
techniques
that
would
test
the
sanity
of
any
normal
person
rather
than
using
techniques
aimed
at
placing
the
complex
occupants
into
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
reports
indicate
several
of
the
children
inside
the
complex
were
accompanied
by
their
mothers
since
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
these
mothers
would
have
their
children
taken
away
from
them
if
they
came
out
why
did
the
fbi
expect
the
mothers
to
just
walk
out
and
surrender
themselves
to
the
authorities
agents
at
the
scene
claim
to
have
seen
members
of
the
branch
davidians
setting
fire
to
the
complex
branch
davidian
members
who
survived
the
inferno
claim
the
fire
was
started
when
an
armored
vehicle
punched
through
the
wall
and
knocked
over
a
lantern
which
was
setting
on
a
table
video
tape
of
the
incident
does
show
an
armored
vehicle
punching
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
the
fire
erupted
almost
immediately
from
the
same
general
location
was
the
source
of
the
fire
the
same
room
where
the
armored
vehicle
penetrated
fbi
spokesmen
are
voicing
the
opinion
that
the
david
koresh
and
the
members
of
the
branch
davidians
committed
mass
suicide
yet
bodies
are
being
discovered
throughout
the
house
and
other
areas
within
the
building
complex
this
seems
to
be
counter
to
any
known
mass
suicides
through
history
what
evidence
does
the
fbi
have
that
a
mass
suicide
pact
existed
fbi
director
sessions
stated
that
the
massive
fireball
shown
on
the
video
tape
was
caused
by
the
branch
davidians
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
exploding
yet
the
fireball
seems
to
be
more
characteristic
of
the
type
created
when
compressed
gas
or
other
highly
volatile
fuel
source
explodes
was
any
evidence
found
which
would
indicate
the
branch
davidians
had
an
ammunition
andor
powder
cache
which
exploded
to
create
this
fireball
if
so
and
if
david
koresh
and
members
of
the
branch
davidians
were
engaged
in
the
legal
business
of
sellingbuying
firearms
was
the
amount
determined
to
be
excessively
greater
than
one
would
expect
for
someone
engaged
in
such
a
legal
business
it
is
rumored
that
one
fbi
agent
was
extremely
upset
about
critical
news
media
coverage
and
intentionally
used
an
armored
vehicle
to
crush
a
reporters
car
which
had
been
left
at
the
compound
is
there
any
factual
basis
to
this
rumor
and
if
so
what
charges
will
be
brought
against
the
fbi
agent
who
performed
the
act
fbi
director
sessions
states
that
during
the
final
assault
on
the
complex
over
shots
were
fired
at
the
vehicles
on
the
video
tape
of
the
incident
you
can
hear
the
drone
of
the
armored
vehicles
engines
yet
there
is
no
sound
of
the
sharp
reports
that
one
would
expect
to
hear
if
shots
were
fired
also
there
are
no
indications
of
smoke
andor
muzzle
flashes
appearing
from
the
windows
buildings
or
other
structures
in
the
video
surely
these
should
be
evident
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
on
the
armored
vehicles
finally
the
video
tape
does
not
show
any
indication
of
paint
splatter
sparks
or
other
characteristic
spray
of
material
which
should
be
apparent
if
the
branch
davidians
had
fired
upon
the
vehicles
do
any
of
the
armored
vehicles
which
were
brought
in
to
pump
tear
gas
into
the
compound
show
evidence
of
fresh
damage
due
to
being
hit
by
shots
from
highpower
rifles
cs
gas
is
considered
to
be
a
chemical
warfare
agent
the
united
states
has
signed
international
treaties
which
prevent
the
use
of
cs
gas
in
warfare
if
the
united
states
could
not
morally
use
cs
gas
against
saddam
hussein
and
his
troops
why
is
it
morally
acceptable
to
use
the
same
agent
against
citizens
of
our
own
land
on
april
fbi
spokesmen
state
that
at
least
bodies
discovered
in
the
complex
had
bullet
wounds
to
the
head
indicating
they
had
been
murdered
or
had
committed
suicide
on
april
the
county
coroner
claims
he
knows
nothing
about
any

found
with
bullet
wounds
to

any
of

at

the
one
that
lost

vernon

i

he

re

has
gone
a
bit
too
far
having
read
the
posted
long
article
by
jpfo
i
have
some
observations
this
article
does
not
claim
that
the
gca
of
is
a
verbatim
translation
of
a
nazi
law
what
it
says
is
that
in
another
place
the
book
theyre
talking
about
they
compare
the
two
things
section
by
section
the
implication
is
that
the
similarities
are
devastating
in
the
next
sentence
they
talk
about
how
in
that
book
they
reproduce
the
german
text
of
the
nazi
law
together
with
its
translation
not
surprisingly
a
reader
could
easily
conflate
these
two
things
into
a
single
idea
that
the
american
gca
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
nazi
law
and
sure
enough
thats
what
the
whole
thing
has
mutated
into
urbanfolklore
style
the
article
goes
to
great
pains
to
establish
that
senator
dodd
had
a
copy
of
the
nazi
law
either
from
his
time
on
the
nurnberg
prosecution
team
or
later
this
fact
is
considered
highly
incriminating
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
author
repeats
several
times
that
he
is
simply
unable
to
imagine
how
anyone
could
come
into
possession
of
the
original
text
and
yet
in
a
paragraph
towards
the
end
he
explains
it
perfectly
if
dodd
got
his
copy
of
the
original
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
during
his
time
at
nurnberg
it
likely
was
part
of
a
collection
of
documents
for
example
issues
of
the
reichsgesetzblatt
the
german
law
registry
bingo
exactly
dodd
had
a
book
with
a
series
of
nazi
laws
in
it
including
the
one
under
discussion
all
of
the
stuff
about
why
would
a
us
congressman
have
a
copy
of
a
nazi
law
melts
away
by
the
authors
admission
he
then
continues
but
if
he
acquired
the
original
german
text
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
after
his
service
at
nurnberg
he
must
have
done
so
for
a
very
specific
reason
but
theres
absolutely
no
reason
to
think
that
this
is
the
case
in
fact
as
a
senior
member
of
the
us
team
that
helped
to
prosecute
nazi
war
criminals
it
seems
to
me
that
he
would
have
had
to
have
a
copy
all
arguments
about
whether
the
nazi
weapon
law
is
really
of
historical
interest
as
it
obviously
is
certainly
according
to
the
author
here
or
whether
dodd
personally
prosecuted
the
interior
minister
who
signed
it
can
be
put
aside
as
red
herrings
having
established
that
dodd
owned
a
copy
of
the
original
german
text
the
jpfo
article
then
tries
to
draw
sinister
implications
from
the
fact
that
he
asked
to
have
it
translated
the
problem
is
in
the
context
of
the
charge
levelled
at
dodd
these
two
things
work
against
each
other
people
ask
to
have
things
translated
when
they
dont
know
what
they
mean
if
dodd
took
it
upon
himself
to
preserve
the
nazi
law
with
idea
of
someday
introducing
it
into
american
law
surely
by
he
would
have
know
what
it
meant
wouldnt
he
anyway
this
precise
charge
the
main
one
that
i
questioned
in
an
earlier
posting
is
just
silly
why
would
dodd
need
the
exact
translation
for
this
purpose
is
the
idea
that
the
gun
controllers
despite
being
presumably
bent
on
disarming
the
populace
with
the
goal
of
eventually
destroying
all
civil
liberties
needed
a
crib
sheet
didnt
they
have
any
idea
how
to
do
it
on
their
own
once
again
the
author
provides
a
perfectly
acceptable
answer
to
his
own
question
dodd
may
have
offered
his
copy
of
the
nazi
weapons
law
to
show
that
the
specific
proposal
did
not
resemble
anything
in
the
nazi
law
in
fact
since
the
law
and
its
translation
were
entered
into
the
congressional
record
under
the
heading
of
documents
concerning
the
history
of
nazism
and
gun
confiscation
dodds
motivation
isnt
a
mystery
he
asked
for
the
translation
in
order
to
put
it
in
the
cr
even
this
article
makes
it
clear
that
the
part
of
the
nazi
law
that
was
added
by
the
nazi
regime
is
only
a
small
part
of
that
law
registration
of
guns
for
instance
was
begun
in
and
thus
not
a
naziinspired
idea
the
parts
of
the
nazi
law
that
parallel
the
gca
include
handgun
control
of
some
sort
and
the
identification
of
certain
weapons
as
sporting
weapons
the
jpfo
then
goes
on
to
list
other
parts
of
the
nazi
law
forbidding
ownership
of
weapons
by
jews
of
course
there
are
no
such
provisions
in
the
american
gca
nevertheless
in
a
rhetorical
move
guaranteed
to
muddy
the
waters
immediately
after
the
discussion
of
the
antijewish
parts
of
the
law
the
jpfo
article
continues
given
the
parallels
between
the
nazi
weapons
law
and
the
so

to
get
maximum
emotional
mileage

if

i
think
wed
all
be
for

the
problem
is
the
methods
were
using
now
dont
do
the
trick
dont
manufacture
them
dont

them
dont
import
them
some
guns
will
get
through

far
fewer
and

less
people
will

because
of
them
hunting

could
be
allowed
of

as
long
as
they
are
big

bulky

require

how
many

can
you
shoot
at
the

anyways
one
assumes
they
are
moving
first
of
all
lets
assume
that
you
are
right
that
fewer
guns
would
make
it
in
to
the
country
that
sounds
great
to
those
that
see
guns
as
inherently
evil
except
then
every
one
of
those
guns
would
be
in
the
hands
of
someone
who
obviously
couldnt
care
less
about
following
the
law
after
all
they
got
the
gun
illegally
so
is
more
likely
to
commit
a
crime
with
that
gun
great
then
everyone
with
a
gun
is
likely
to
use
it
in
a
crime
nice
system
now
as
to
reducing
the
number
of
guns
coming
into
society
by
making
it
illegal
to
manufacture
sell
or
import
them
in
this
coutry
let
me
use
a
parallel
for
empiric
evidence
the
amount
of
cocaine
in
this
country
is
far
less
since
its
manufacture
sale
and
importation
was
out
lawwed
if
that
last
statement
is

perhaps
we
should
consider
your
plan
this

what
is
the
status
of
these

ive
heard
theyre
in

how
close
is
that
to
being
made

not
very
thanks
to
the

things
are
backing
up
the

judiciary
is
going
to
start
looking
at
our
friends
from
the
atf
so
that
bill
will
be
held
up
a
little
too
note
things
can
change
quickly
and
seem
fairly
similar
are
there
any
important
differences
i
missed
seems
to
have
some
serious
loopholes
a
doesnt
specify
an
appeals
process
to
wrongful
denial
during
the
waiting
period
other
than
a
civil
lawsuit
has
an
appeals
process
once
the
required
instant
background
check
system
is
established
but
not
before
i
thought
there
was
a
correction
process
in
both
bills
for
both
parts
b
the
police
are
explicitly
not
liable
for
mistakes
in
denyingapproving
using
existing
records
so
who
would
i
sue
in
a
above
to
have
an
inaccurate
record
corrected
very
correct
c
includes
an
exceptiontowaitingperiod
clause
for
if
a

can
convince
the
local
chief
lawenforcement
officer
cleo
of
an
immediate
threat
to
his
or
her
life
or
life
of
a
household
member
but
doesnt
say
exactly
what
is
considered
a
threat
nor
does
it
place
a
limit
on
how
long
the
cleo
takes
to
issue
an
exception
statement
welcome
to
the
world
of
the
privileged
true
have
i
misunderstood
any
other
holes
how
about
no
compulsion
to
allow
purchase
if
there
is
no
evidence
against
with
just
whats
to
stop
a
person
with
a
clean
record
from
buying
guns
grinding
off
the
serial
numbers
and
selling
them
to
crooks
at
minimum
what
additional
laws
are
needed
to
prevent
this
it
is
already
illegal
to
do
this
seems
at
min
a
gun
counting
scheme
would
be
needed
eg
john

if
passes
i
wouldnt
be

loyalty

they

could

and
say
that
the

was
just
stupid
i
say
i
dont
believe
it
the
fbi
has
acces
to
the
latest
in
audio
and
video
technology
the
latest
digital

the
fbi
can
manufacture
evidence
need
a

and
you
can
have

a

lighting

and
through
the
magic
of

you
can
have

the
thing
is
manufacturing
these
pieces
of

takes
time
so
it
may
be

before
we

we

making

checking

spoke

six
of

who

that

the

the

punching

proceeded

the

did
laundry
others
read

the

all

remained

sides
still
it
was
hard
to

what
was

it

dodges
falling
gypsum
wallboard

hundreds
of

hurled

noxious

the
flying
canisters
were
more
frightening
than
the
tanks
at
least
one
man
was
hit
in
the
face
the
gas
began
filling
the
air
driven
by
heavy
gusts
of
wind
coming
through
windows
and
the
holes
the
tanks
made
scattered
throughout
the
house
the
cult
members
made
no
efforts
to
gather
then
the
fbi
sent
in
its
biggest

a
massive
armored

headed
for
a

lined
with
cinder
blocks
where
authorities
hoped
to
find
koresh
and
schneider
and
fire
tear

directly
at
them
here
the
cult
members
story
diverges
from
the
governments
version
the
fbi
says
cult
members
set
fires
in
three
places
but
each
of
the
six
cult
members
in
separate
discussions
with
lawyers
consistently
gave
versions
at
odds
with
the
fbis
account
they
say
the
tank
flattened
a
barrel
of
propane
spilling
its
contents
and
as
the
tank
thundered
through
the
house
it
tipped
over
lit
lanterns
spitting
flames
that
ignited
the
propane
and
other

the

maybe
im
too
religious
but
when
i
see
a
bill
to
establish
a
right
i
wince
keep
in
mind
what
the
law
giveth
the
law
can
taketh
away
hey
guys
youre
absolutely
correct
and
well
on
the
way
to
winning
this
battle
and
losing
the
war
yes
there
are
serious
philosophical
flaws
in
hr
technical
ones
too
howd
you
like
to
sue
the
feds
lose
and
have
to
pay
their
reasonable
attorneys
fee
still
i
have
one
basic
question
compared
to
what
weve
got
is
hr
a
better
or
b
worse
this
one
shouldnt
even
take
you
three
guesses
compared
to
the
second
amendment
i
think
its
worse
the
problem
is
the
devil
is
in
the
details
you
know
the
brady
bill
sounds
like
a
good
idea
too
until
you
discover
that
there
is
no
check
and
that
the
police
dont
have
to
allow
your
purchase
even
if
you
check
out
and
that
you
have
no
recourse
if
they
dont
are
there
any
loopholes
here
im
no
lawyer
i
cant
be
sure
i
would
have
never
noticed
the
second
one
mentioned
above
in
the
brady
bill
for
example
the
more
words
involved
the
more
details
what
was
that
saying
about
abraham
lincoln
requiring
words
to
free
the
slaves
and
the
modern
congress
requiring
words
to
describe
price
controls
on
rice
if
theres
a
good
enough
show
of
support
for
hr
maybe
for
a
change
we
could
be
the
ones
saying
its
a
reasonable
first
step
that
only
works
with
bad
laws
good
laws
are

the

about

that
so
many

they

from

i

it

heres
a
clue
independent
thinkers
are
able
to
come
to
either
conclusion
depending
on
the
circumstances
noncritical
thinkers
are
the
ones
who
would
always
come
to
the
same
type
of
conclusion
regardless
of
the
circumstances
independent
thinkers
question
authority
in
a
situation
where
only
one
set
of
facts
are
being
presented
coming
to
a
conclusion
is
not
the
hallmark
of
an
independent
thinker
unless
its
coupled
with
the
ability
to
challenge
those
facts
critically
the
scientific
method
consists
of
more
than
choosing
the
popular
hypothesis
its
even
more
than
choosing
between

gave

that

a

perhaps
youve
been

how
in

supposed

every

thats

we

an

he

he

he
wasnt

rules

wake
up
what
i
would

this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn

i
question
some
of
the
atf

fbi
actions
right
and
proper
how
it
was
fubar
from

could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside

at
some
time
before
the

all
independent

yes
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
it
would
have
hurt
nothing
to
wait
and
the
result
could
hardly
have
been
worse
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
sure
it
you
want
to
someone
you
claim
is
a
dangerous
paranoid
even
more
paranoid
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead

take

seems
like
the

figuring

seems
to
me
that
if
they
did
have
this
kind
of
info
they
could
broadcast
it
and
it
would
resolve
or
at
least
help
to
resolve
alot
of
doubt
in
peoples
minds
personally
the
way
the
fbibatfrenoetc
is
claiming
all
sorts
of
things
without
offering
one
shred
of
proof
other
than
their
good
word
is
very
suspicious
to
me
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words
i
understand
that
at
least
two
goverment
investigations
have
been
ordered
so
we
may
learn
more
during
their
hearings
i
sincerely
hope
you
are
right
and
it
turns
out
with
indisputable
proof
broadcast
across
our
land
that
the
government
groups
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fire
but
until
i
see
such
proof
i
think
it
is
just
as
likely
that
a
tank
did
knock
over
a
lantern
as
koresh
torching
the
place
the
only
evidence
i
have
seen
is
a
tank
crashing
through
the
front
wall
withdrawing
and
seconds
later
flames
are
seen
the
first
flames
on
the
video
erupting
from
this
very
same
spot
coincidence
perhaps
tough
call
without
more
investigation
but
if
the
thermal
imaging
story
holds
up
i
think
the
government
will
be
more
credable
of
course
paranoia
fans
wont
believe
their
results
anyway
will
they
if
such
proof
exists
the
government
should
publish
it
and
put
all
this
speculation
to
rest
hear

id
also
like
to
see
the
autopsy
reports
confirm
news
reports
that
multiple
victims
were
found
shot
in
the
head
and
in
positions
inconsistent
with
fire
victims
it
is
simply
too
early
to
draw
conclusions
either
way
about
this
nasty
incident

to

was

newspaper
at
the
university
of

at

a
study
of
residential
gunsot
deaths
in
king
county
wash
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
the
used
to
kill
is
the
heart
of
the
misinformation
its
one
of
those
technically
accurate
phrasings
that
conveys
the
wrong
impression
what
mr
quiqley
is
more
than
aware
of
im
sure
is
that
when
people
read
this
they
think
violent
arguments
where
one
member
of
the
family
grabs
a
gun
and
shoots
another
thereby
creating
a
tragic
situation
which
could
easily
have
been
avoided
had
the
gun
not
been
there
or
a
tragic
accident
especially
involving
a
child
unfortunately
thats
not
the
way
things
stack
up
the
majority
of
that
times
i
believe
are
suicides
that
is
someone
intentionally
took
a
firearm
and
shot
themselves
intending
to
kill
themselves
and
why
its
popular
to
try
and
blame
suicides
on
guns
the
evidence
doesnt
support
this
internal
studies
as
well
as
comparative
studies
with
other
countries
indicate
that
cultural
factors
far
outweigh
whether
a
person
will
kill
themselves
or
not
japan
for
instance
has
a
slightly
higher
rate
than
the
us
there
people
jump
off
buildings
according
to
the
national
crime
survey
of
violent
crime
is
commited
by
nonstrangers
which
mistakenly
has
been
generalized
regarding
the
king
county
study
to
mean
friends
and
family
that
is
mr
quigley
and
others
who
quote
this
statistic
are
banking
on
the
mental
image
that
a
friend
family
member
or
child
equates
to
a
loving
relationship
and
that
it
was
cut
short
in
a
moment
of
anger
unfortunately
all
too
often
husbands
beat
and
kill
wives
children
assault
parents
or
viceversa
most
rapes
are
commited
by
someone
known
to
the
victim
for
instance
essentially
that
a
gun
was
used
against
a
friend
or
family
member
doesnt
mean
they
werent
trying
to
hurt
the
other
person
crime
is
highest
among
poor
urban
families
and
those
are
also
the
areas
most
at
risk
for
family
problems
especially
violent
ones
a
son
in
a
gang
may
not
be
as
loving
toward
his
parents
if
they
disapprove
than
a
suburban
kid
might
finally
it
hinges
on
the
fallacy
that
a
dead
intruder
is
the
only
value
of
a
selfdefense
firearm
using
the
minimum
figures
i
worked
out
using
the
ncs
i
got
about
an
ratio
between
deadly
selfdefenses
justifiable
homicides
and
withgun
selfdefenses
between
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
and
the
ncs
theres
an
enormous
amount
of
data
and
anybody
with
the
calculator
can
crunch
the
numbers
as
such
it
is
incorrect
to
assume
that
a
dead
body
is
the
only
valid
means
of
determining
the
success
of
such
a
defense
since
according
to
the
ncs
which
has
been
considered
by
many
to
seriously
underreport
defenses
there
were
far
more
successful
withgun
defenses
than
intruders
killed
not
it
also
confines
itself
to
the
home
where
attack
by
a
friend
or
family
member
is
far
far
more
likely
and
excludes
any
defense
which
occurs
outside
the
home
i
believe
a
large
number
occur
in
businesses
studies
by
the
western
psychiatric
institute
in
pittsburgh
found
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
sharply
incresases
the
likelihood
a
family
member
will
commit
suicide
even
in
the
absence
of
psychiatric
illness
i
have
not
seen
the
exact
data
for
this
so
i
cant
comment
i
will
point
out
canadas
and
japans
suicide
rate
as
indications
that
culture
far
more
than
firearm
availability
affect
suicide
rates
there
was
also
a
comparative

between
canada
for
what
its
worth
considering
the
difficulty
of
comparing
across
cultural
lines

in

i
can

if

a

is
the
last
thing
that
should

the

thing
that
i

is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in

trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safety
is
supposed
to
do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
what
i
safety
is
supposed
to
do
kratz
comments
above
show
otherwise
its
basic
purpose
not
to
let
the
gun
fire
until
youre
ready
bingo
now
the
question
is
does
the
glocks
qualify
lets
see
the
evidence
that
kratz
uses
christ
ive
known
that
since
i
had
my
first
crosman
air
gun
you
dont
know
me
so
dont
make
assumptions
about
what
i
know
and
dont
know
but
first
an
aside
having
an
air
gun
proves
nothing
moreover
my
comments
are
based
on
what
kratz
writes
hes
free
to
argue
that
he
babbles
in
text
but
actually
knows
something
offline
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the
gun
from
going
off
unless
thats
what
the
user
wants
with
glocks
one
says
i
want
the
gun
to
go
off
by
pulling
the
trigger
if
the
safeties
it
has
make
that
work
it
has
a
real
safety
no
matter
what
kratz
thinks
from
the
things
i
have
readheard
glocks
are
always
knocked
because
of
the
trigger
safety
they
are
supposedly
harder
to
learn
to
use
properly
harder
than
what
i
note
that
almost
all
revolvers
work
the
same
way
so
it
cant
be
harder
than
revolvers
every
article
that
i
have
read
cant
be
wrong
about

moreover
we

that

it

basically
these

are
dangerous
because
theyre
not
like
my
third

part
of
that
is
true
but
since
those
same
people
dont
claim
that
revolvers
which
share
the
relevant
property
are
dangerous
we
see
that
the
argument
fails
me
to
quote

says
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang

and
not
undercover

or
even
lawabiding
menacing

btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
so
kratz
was
there
does
that
mean
that
hes
a
gang
member
even
in
the
most
ganginfested
areas
most
of
the
residents
are
not
gangmembers
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
how
was
it
obvious
were
they
not
trying
to
hit
the
target
or
does
kratz
confuse
marksmanship
with
trying
to
simulate
a
post
if
so
that
excludes
selfdefense
shooting
but
the
rest
of
us
understand
that
that
exclusion
would
be
an
error
it
excludes
a
lot
of
legit
gun
games
as
well
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
sounds
like
practical
pistol
or
maybe
ipsc
it
also
sounds
like
how
a
selfdefense
shooter
might
well
practice
the
only
things
that
action
excludes
are
hunting

so

up

than
the

committed

btw
they
didnt
honestly
count
the

either
but
lets
not
quibble
they
try
to
claim
that

is
between
the

but
theyre
wrong
this
comparison
doesnt
measure
the
costs
of
selfdefense
and
it
doesnt
measure
the
benefits
either
for
example
the
goal
is
not
to
kill
the
attacker
whatever
your
relationship
to
him
but
to
stop
him
while
the
number
of
killings
may
be
proportional
to
the
number
of
stops
it
isnt
equal
anyone
who
confuses
that

the
article
in
turn
cites
a
misleading
statistic
that
was
originally
reported
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
article
states
a
study
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
this
is
an
oftenquoted
statistic
and
it
is
misleading
for
sev
eral
reasons
outlined
below
the
study
gives
the
impression
that
if
you
own
a
gun
the
likelihood
that
you
will
successfully
use
it
to
defend
yourself
is
less
than
that
of
the
gun
being
turned
against
you
the
study
however
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
where
a
lawabiding
citizen
uses
a
gun
to
thwart
a
crime
without
actually
killing
the
perpe
trator
the
study
actually
refers
to
acquaintances
rather
than
friend

the

check
possibly
an

but
hardly

the
nejm
study
is
based
on
the
immediate
dis
position
of
cases
and
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
originally
filed
as
homicides
that
were
later
ruled
to
be
selfdefense

effect
on
the

gary

slightly
dif
erent
statistic
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
successfully
by
a
private
citizen
against
an
aggressor
than
it
is
to
kill
anyone
at
all
further
per
sons
defending
themselves
from
aggression
by
using
a
gun
fare
better
than
those
who
resist
vicimization
by
some
other
means
or
who
offer
no
resistance
at
all
statistics
available
from
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
also
show
that
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
by
a
noncriminal
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be
used
to
commit
criminal
homicide
times
more
likely
to
be

to
accidentally
kill
anybody
and
times
more
likely

says
from
ap
according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
this
claim
hasnt
been
retracted
or
contradicted
yet
as
many
earlier
government
claims
have
at
least
one
clip
showed
a
fire
erupting
after
a
tank
busted
in
a
wall
we
have
unsubstantiated
claims
by
the
government
about
the
flirs
spotting
simultaneous
fires
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
thats
easy
six
hours
of
cs
gas
heavy
smoke
from
a
rapidly
spreading
fire
confusion
panic
only
got
out
the
building
was
collapsing
all
around
them
and
finding
the
way
out
was
a
matter
of
luck
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
the
davidians
may
have
committed
suicide
or
some
few
zealots
among
them
might
have
started
the
fires
that
is
possible
but
given
the
governments
earlier
inability
to
tell
a
straight
story
i
find
my
above
scenario
equally
possible
i
wait
for
some
independent
investigation
to
look
into
the
whole
thing
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
government
spokespeople
had
been
consistent
and
forthright
throughout
keeping
the
press
far
away
and
ghettoized
in
pools
was
not
conducive
to
building
up
trust
sealing
the
warrants
was
nonoptimal
as
well
this
operation
was
out
of
control
from
the
gitgo
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
speaking
only
for
myself
i
think
bush
and
reagan
should
have
been
impeached
over
irancontra
in
i
would
probably
have
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
government
no
more
like
i
said
ill
wait
to
see
the
results
of
an
independent
investigation
if
there
is
one
before
i
choose
whom
to
believe
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
you
got
one
anyway
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
i
generally
vote
for
the
lesser
of
two
evils
this
last
time
it
was
the
least
of
three
evils
if
people
will
believe
that
of
any
politican
it
is
little
wonder
they
will
believe
all
of
the
factoids
being
given
out
as
fact
by
the
clintonrenofbibatf
confederation
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty

are
they

just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they

throw

dart
at

im
eager
to
know
it
was
a
bureaucratic
execution
out

bureaucracies
driven

the

from
monday
the
fbi
called
within
minutes
of
the
fires
breakout
unfortunately
dispatch
of
vehicles
outside
the
waco
city
limits
required
approval
of
a
deputy
chief
who
was
not
available
literally
out
to
lunch
the
operator
desperately
called
around
to
local
community
volunteer
fire
departments
to
get
something
out
there
by
the
time
trucks
arrived
minutes
later
the
whole
complex
was
aflame
and
it
was
clearly
too
little
too
late
there
were
just
two
pumpers
and
no
water
supply
the
fbi
made
another
call
requesting
a
tank
truck
but
the
waco
department
apparently
depended
on
hydrants
and
did
not
have
one
though
clearly
unwilling
to
risk
firemens
lives
in
the
line
of
fire
it
seems
they
might
have
done
so
had
there
been
sufficient
equipment
and
water
to
make
a
difference
they
even
aired
a
tape
of
a
woman
who
called
waco
from
georgia
asking
if
anything
was
being
done
civicminded
but
probably
irresponsible
if
everyone
watching
television
did
that
no
local
calls
could
get

abc
also
aired
the
comments
of
an
independent
fire
investigator
who
viewed
tapes
from
more
than
one
side
of
the
compound
not
just
the
standard
pool
shot
and
agreed
that
the
fire
a
must
have
been
started
in
at
least
places
and
b
must
have
had
an
accelerant
to
spread
so
fast
neither
of
these
is
conclusive
proof
that
the
koresh

offed
themselves
more

claims
he
heard
someone
shouting

odd
terminology
thats
what
one
says
when
you
know
a
fire
is
planned
not
when
one
occurs
by
accident
its
also
what
you
say
when
youre
waiting
for
the
end
to
come
in
a
fiery
apocalypsejust
a
thought
personally
if
the
fire
was
set
by
either
side
i
wonder
about
the
timing
if
koresh
co
set
the
fires
why
wait
through
six
hours
of
wallbashing
and
teargassing
before
starting
was
there
anything
new
that
happened
just
around
that
point
similarly
if
the
fbi
were
going
to
torch
the
place
and
fake
it
of
course
why
wait
so
long
wouldnt
it
be
more
reasonable
to
believe
the
bds
would
set
the
fire
early
after
the
assault
began
the
most
plausible
to
me
explaination
is
that
of
an
accidental
starting
of
the
fire
by
the
tanks
among
other
things
i
say
that
because
i
was
listening
to
the
radio
when
the
fire
started
and
the
reporter
watching
from
a
distance
of
course
said
that
it
looked
like
at
least
one
of
the
tanks
had
penetrated
farther
into
the
building
than
previously
specifically
he
said
that
one
tank
apparently
was
halfway
half
of
the
tanks
lenght
into
the
building
where
it
previously
had
only
been
penetrating
a
few
feet

point
out
that
even
if
the

was

by
someone
inside
of
the

it
came
as
a
direct
result
of
the
actions
of
the
fbibatf
and
the
people
inside
including
children
deserved
a
trial
instead
of
this
well
they
had
over
days
to
come
out
with
their

up
on
national

to
get
the
trial
they

they
chose
to
set
fire
to
their
compund
hours
after
the
tanks
dropped
off
the
tear
gas
correction
the
fbi
says
that
the
davidians
set
fire
to
their
buildings
and
i
suppose
the
fbi
also
prevented
them
from
coming
out
with
their
hands
up
while
national
tv
cameras
watch
well
the
attorneys
of
the
davidians
reported
on
larry
king
that
the
tanks
had
actually
damaged
the
structure
to
the
extent
that
effectuating
egress
from
the
building
was
difficult
at
best
with
a
rapidly
spreading
fire
and
large
amounts
of
smoke
and
tear
gas
finding
the
right
exits
or
acceptible
holes
in
the
walls
were
nearly
impossible
i
find
this
explanation
to
be
completely
plausible
doesnt
mean
that
its
true
but
i
dont
find
it
intrinsically
less
believable
than
the
government
stories
the
fbi
also
said
that
the
davidians
had
a
methanphetamine
lab
in
their
basement
and
that
the
davidians
had
cal
machine
guns
do
you
believe
everything
the
fbi
says
do
you
disbelieve
everything
the
fbi
says
i
balance
my
gut
reaction
to
question
authority
together
with
the
independent
facts
as
i
see
them
on
video
i
usually
adopt
the
scenario
that
is
simplest
and
most
plausible
i
do
not
generally
believe
in
conspiracy
theories
that
involve
complicated
and
unlikely
scenarios
i
concur
the
batf
is
by
no
means
devoid
of
fault
in
the
handling
of
this
affair
but
to
suggest
that
they
may
have
intentionally
started
the
fire
is
ludicrous
indeed
according
to
the
lawyers
the
davidian
survivors
say
that
lanterns
were
knocked
over
during
the
probing
and
thats
how
the
fire
started
a
tragic
accident
if
true
do
you
trust
that
snivelling
little
piece
of
sht
special
agent
ricks
he
seems
to
think
he
is
a

and
the

who
laugh
at
his
sick
jokes
are
just
as
guilty
as
he
imho
up
until
now
the
batf
had
been
making
me
sick
today
the
people
inside
the
compound
who
set
the
fire
made
me
sick
keeping
the
children
inside
the
compund
when
they
should
have
been
released
earlier
with
the
other
people
weeks
ago
is
absolutely
inexcuseable
not
releasing
them
before
deciding
to
set
the

afire

two

members
if
the

were

i
would

expected

more

flee

at

come

see
above
this

is
going
to
be
thoroughly
investigated
maybe
well
eventually
get
some
idea
of
what
happened
my
view
is
that
from
beginning

this

was
a
botch
and
that
it
is
completely
possible
that

if

it

but
if

it

and
anyone

in

pretty
fking
nervous
why
if
youre
not
a

youre
not
affected
at
all
i
mean
take
this
to
its
logical
conclusion
suppose
we
all
carried
handguns
all
the

for
protection
from
all
the
other
people
carrying
handguns
would
we
collectively
be

hell
no

feel
a

more
insecure
why
i
note
that
the
available
psych
info
says
that
feelings

increase
the
victimization
stats
say
that
that
increase
is
rational
another
systemic
effect
of
all
the

protecting
themselves
is
that
the
bad
people
are
going

modify
their

in

yes
they
are

how
theyre
going

be

i

a

might
also
be
an
artificial
entity
that
is
created
by
government
and
has
no
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
so
what
i
dont

is
how
a
statute
like
can
be
enforced
on
an
individual
so
someone
tell
me
how
my

can
tell
me
what
i
can
or

just
passing

u
im
not
a
lawyer
but
to
the
best
of
my
understanding
the
congress
has
no
more
rights
than
what
is
enumerated
in
the
constitution
that
is
the
prime
reason
why
the
national
firearms
act
is
based
on
collecting
revenue
since
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
the
nfa
is
a
tax
act
and
the
registration
requirement
within
it
is
to
assist
in
that
tax
collection
usc
in
order
to
be
constitutional
must
have
a
basis
on
a
particular
authority
granted
to
the
congress
by
the
constitution
congress
can
not
arbitrarily
ban
a
substance
or
product
that
is
why
prohibition
came
into
effect
only
by
passing
an
ammendment
what
you
said
about
constitutionality
of

needs
to
be

believe

an

was
never
constitutional
when
a

that

was
never
really
a

the

invalidates

correct

if
im
wrong

when

anyone

would
pay
through

nose
for
it
good
point
you
make
however
a
zip
gun
by
definition
is
a
crude
homemade
guncertainly
not
something
capable
of
sustained
accurate
fire
but
it
would
be
useful
as
a
means
of
getting
a
normal
gun
recall
the
tiny
singleshot
pistols
made
by
the
allies
during
world
war
ii
for
use
by
partisans
they
were
essentially
wellmade
zipguns
incapable
of
effective
fire
beyond
a
few
feet
but
they
were
useful
as
a
means
of
killing
german
soldiers
for
their
guns
also
note
that
the

favorite
the

was
specifically
designed

require
as
little

here
that

still

the

in

quality
marijuana
can
be
grown
locally
theres
no
need
to
import
the
stuff
if
guns
are
banned
i
think
the
demand
for
real
guns
will
be
sufficient
to
make
smuggling
economically
feasible
thus
rendering
a
ban
moot
in
any
case
the
result
would
be
the
samepeople
who
arent

wont

any

think
its
a
small
metal
tag
thats
placed
over
the

the
net
result
of
this
is
that
you
cant
use
a
gun
to
protect
yourself

bears

psychos
in

instead
one
has
to
be
sensitive

the
dangers

annoyances
of
hiking
in
bear
country
and
take
the
appropriate
precautions
i
think
this
policy
makes
the
users
of
the
national

feel
a
little
closer
to
nature
that
they
are
a

the

nothing

what
would

a

me
would
have
been
media
video
particularly
from
diverse
sources
imho
if
the
government
didnt
have
anything
to
hide
they
would
have
allowed
cameras
near
the
compound
from
the
beginning
i
agree
i
saw
no
reason
they
could
not
have
had
close
in
pool
cameras
manned
by
volunteers
and
protected
by
sandbags
or
whatever
points
made
by
dick
degueran
koreshs
lawyer
the
tanks
were
not
pumping
cs
gas
but
were
ejecting
exploding
canisters
from
the
tank
booms
that
penetrated
multiple
walls
before
exploding
okay
their
word
against
the
fbis
at
this
point
see
ya
in
court
the
tanks
were
collapsing
interior
walls
and
ceilings
putting
people
at
great
risk
dear
dear
they
could
have
come
out
the
construction
of
the
coupound
used
almost
all
used
materials
that
were
very
dry
and
bails
of
hay
were
stacked
against
the
walls
as
shields
against
the
governments
bullets
okay
they
were
living
in
a
fire
hazard
that
they
built
said
that
previous
to
the
invasion
there
were
no
military
drills
and
that
the
supplies
they
had
on
hand
were
for
survival
no
crime
irrelevant
either
way
their
gas
masks
worked
so
well
that
many
members
were
having
bible
study
and
some
were
sleeping
when
the
fire
was
set
ah
yes
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
do
hold
bible
study
take
a
nap
always
a
wise
course
of
action
when
youre
being
gassed
there
was
no
group
instruction
of
any
kind
from
koresh
or
his
aids
after
the
tank
invasion
referring
to
any
kind
of
suicide
pact
or
counterassault
efforts
i
dont
believe
there
was
a
suicide
pact
i
believe
that
koresh
wanted
a
fiery
conflagration
which
he
may
not
have
told
his
followers
in
fact
this
hypothesis
is
confirmed
by
the
survivors
stories
everyone
had
moved
to
the
center
of
the
compound
in
order
to
escape
the
falling
debris
from
the
tank
invasion
when
the
fire
was
set
yes
thats
right
and
once
the
whole
compound
was
demolished
where
did
they
expect
to
go
women
and
children
who
has
sought
shelter
on
the
second
floor
from
the
tanks
were
trapped
by
doors
jammed
by
the
tanks
ramming
the
building
and
distorting
the
frames
the
building
is
being
rammed
and
they
are
going
upstairs
thats
almost
as
bad
as
running
into
a
fire
hallways
ran
the
length
of
the
buildings
that
acted
as
conduits
for
the
fire
and
trapped
almost
everyone
in
place
his
experts
have
told
him
that
this
horizonal
chimney
effect
is
what
made
the
fire
appear
to
have
started
at
several
places
at
once
hm
an
interesting
notion
well
see
koresh
was
not
seen
the
last
hour
before
the
fire
and
was
assumed
to
be
in
his
floor
room
with
some
of
his
children
more
bible
study
no
doubt
hey
its
a
priority
the
texas
medical
examiner
has
stated
flatly
that
none
of
the
bodies
recovered
so
far
had
bullet
wounds
directly
contradicting
the
fbis
lies
actually
on
friday
he
stated
that
there
was
no
evidence
either
way
and
he
could
not
flatly
contradict
the
federal
agents
claims
well
know
more
later
in
any
event
its
irrelevant
the
survivors
unanimously
stated
that
if
the
victims
could
have
gotten
out
they
would
have
that
they
were
trapped
by
the
tankdestroyed
building
and
the
speed
of
the
fire
for
six
hours
they
were
trapped
the
building
was
not
destroyed
immediately
they
could
have
left
at
any
time
the
underground
bunker
cited
by
the
fbi
as
the
place
koresh
could
have
put
the
children
had
he
not
been
a
cold
blooded
killer
had
been
blocked
by
the
tanks
crashing
down
debris
on
top
of
the
access
door
six
hours
to
move
it
away
or
come
out
dick
said
that
he
had
sat
in
koreshs
bedroom
talking
to
him
and
had
observed
that
his
room
was
furnished
like
all
the
rest
and
without
air
condition
or
other
luxuries
directly
contradicting
the
fbis
claim
that
he
lived
in
splendor
irrelevant
anyway
pr
one
way
or
the
other
but
no
crime
or
innocence
indicated
dick
saw
bullet
holes
in
koreshs
room
made
from
the
outsidein
which
indicates
the
batf
was
indiscriminately
shooting
down
through
the
roof
no
word
on
whether
they
were
being
fired
back
at
which
is
an
operative
question
here
the
fire
was
probably
started
by
the
tanks
knocking
over
coleman
lanterns
that
were
lit
and
sitting
on
a
piano
next
to
the
wall
the
tanks
busted
through
though
none
of
the
survivors
saw
the
fire
start
right
for
six
hours
you
know
that
a
tank
could
come
thru
the
wall
at
any
point
and
you
leave
a
coleman
lantern
burning
near
bales
of
hay
every
one
of
the
survivors
strongly
denies
ever
saying
anything
to
the
fbi
about
starting
the
fire
hearing
someone
say
the
fire
was
lit
or
any
of
the
other
stuff
attributed
to
them
by
the
fbi
its
ultimately
irrelevant
who
lit
the
fire
they
had
ample
opportunity
to
leave
he
said
when
he
first
met
koresh
in
the
compound
he
expected
to
find
a
raving
lunatic
but
instead
found
a
rational
charming
and
intelligent
young
man
and
was
very
surprised
by
that
fact
most
charismatic
leaders
are
extremely
intelligent
actually
they
tend
to
be
excellent
actors
and
skilled
manipulators
ex
ted
bundy
koresh
had
no
drugs
stronger
than
aspirin
to
use
against
pain
medical
assistance
was
jsut
a
phone
call
away
gee
all
he
had
to
do
was
come
out
women
with
children
had
their
own
bedrooms
for
them
and
their
kids
that
were
appointed
as
nicely
as
koreshs
not
relevant
to
any
crimes
dick
said
he
saw
signs
of
home
schooling
for
the
kids
and
at
no
time
did
he
ever
see
any
signs
of
abuse
while
he
was
there
anyway
outsiders
rarely
see
abuse
its
a
secretive
thing
all
we
have
to
go
on
are
the
court
documents
in
the
jewell
case
and
the
mistrial
in
california
no
one
was
ever
held
against
their
wills
and
could
have
left
at
any
time
the
people
who
were
murdered
in
the
fire
were
there
by
their
own
choices
exactly
by
their
own
choice
he
called
for
an
independent
prosecutor
if
ever
there
were
a
need
for
one
this
is
it
looks
like
there
will
be
several
investigations
starting
with
congressional
committee
hearings
next
week
his
closing
comments
were
they
dont
look
upon
themselves
as
a
cult
they
view
themselves
as
highly
religious
people
they
sincerely
believe
what
they
believe
and
who
am
you
or
i
to
judge
that
as
wrong
his
last
sentence
says
it
all
who
the
hell
are
we
or
the
government
to
judge
their
religion
as
wrong
this
event
i
hope
will
be
recorded
in
history
as
the
american
holocaust
these
people
were
murdered
by
the
us
government
just
as
surely
as
the
jews
were
by
the
nazis
i
hang
my
head
in
shame
for
what
ive
allowed
my
government
to
become
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
just
as
we
dont
blame
a
cop
who
shoots
a
kid
who
had
pointed
a
toy
weapon
at
him
i
dont
think
the
fbi
deserves
blame
in
this
case

perhaps
they
didnt

because
fleeing
would
have
meant
entering

like
they

wait
a

the

being

is
that
the

started
in

this
is
not
consistent
with
the
story
that
they
were
trapped
by

in
a

all
of
a

had
many
more

choose

please
what

what
if
the
fbi
thought
that
tear
gas
would
force
the
davidians
out
at

the
mothers
and
the
children
so
they
the
fbi
did
not
bother
to
think
about
the
effect
of
tear

on
young
children
what
if
the
fbi
knew
they
killed
several
of
the
children
by
using
tear
gaslets
assume
the
fbi
knew
via
their
listening
devices
what
if
the
fbi
saw
fire
accidently
break
out
at
one
end
of
the
building

by
an
upset
oil
lamp
what

they
could
finally
force
the
rest
of
the
davidians
out
and
also
destroy
the
evidence
that
they
the
fbi
had
killed
the
children
by
starting
a
fire
at

other
end

miscalculated

dan

endless
remarks
of
how
the
davidians
could
have
surrendered
deleted
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
if
they
had
been
quiet
there
would
have
been
no
deaths
i
thought
thier
neighbors
said
that
the
davidians
never
bothered
them
oh
well
that
couldnt
have
been
your
point
then
if
they
hadnt
been
stockpiling
weapons
then
the
atf
wouldnt
have
felt
threatened
and
had
to
move
in
heres
a
newsflash
it
isnt
illegal
to
own
more
than
one
firearm
it
isnt
even
illegal
to
own
lots
of
firearms
they
shot
federales
the
feds
shot
them
too
how
about
that
staying
inside
thing
heres
another
newsflash
sometimes
the
government
does
nasty
things
to
you
that
you
dont
deserve
since
they
were
so
nice
to
the
davidians
the
first
time
round
i
can
see
why
the
davidians
didnt
surrender
so
easily
especially
because
they
were
expecting
the
end
of
the

i
wonder
if
i
can
get
the
gasoline
concession
i
agree
that
koresh
was
as
much
of
a
victim
as
a
perpetrator
this
because
he
grew
up
inside
the
cult
and
engaged
in
a
power
struggle
where
his
supporters
helped
inflate
his
ego
yup
kill
that
bastard
this
was
no
move
fuckup
a
helicoptor
was
thermalimaging
the

ah
yes
the
illegal
helicopter
searchign
for

nonexistent

lab
i
remember
it
well
even
if
the

and
yall
tell
me
i
dont
call
me
winston
that
afternoon
and
detected
three
fires
erupting
almost
simultaneously
there
were
no

canisters
a
specially

was
pupming
the
ahhh
yes
the
nonexistent

call

winston
again
stuff
in
no
chance
of
starting
a
fire
there
kerosene
lamps
maybe
one
but
not
three
fires
no
way
koresh
wasnt
just
talking
out
of
his
ass
i
expected
this
to
happen
i
did
too
but
for
different
reasons
the
fbi
has
a
habit
of
burning
up
people
in
fortified
areas
maybe
they
wanted
it
to
look
like
murder
he
had
days
i
think
this
was
coming
the
whole
time
he
didnt
even
put
the
children
in
the
buried
bus
or
the

bunker
during

seige
he
put
them
up

fuck
all

the

its

id
have
a
spot
of
tea
with
them
you
probably
gave
up
on
arguing
the
case
for
arms
control
directly
long
ago
because
posters
who
know
what
they
are
talking
about
eg
frank
crary
disproved
all
your
arguments
for
why
more
gun

is
needed
so
you
gave
up
because
you
know
they
are
right
and
you
couldnt
refute
their
answers
no

are
based

select

anybody
who
seriously
generalizes
any

on

to
the

population
of
any

either
doesnt
care
about

needs

explained

ive

put

a

i
have
a
feeling
is
fairly
inflated
the
posters
rare

regular
are

a
very
tiny
minority
of
that
group
and
the
whole
of
usenet
readers
are
themselves
a
very
distorted
sample
of
humanity
if
anything
the
only
real
thing
you
can
get
out
of
the
relative
sample
of
usenet
readers
is
that
weve
got
too
much
equipment
and
too
much
time
available
to

we
now
have
proof
positive
that
guns
dont

and
you
either
get
shot
in
the
no

raid
or
get
the
fbi
to
burn
down
your

proof
that
guns
dont
make

safer
is
that
if
you
buy
one
the

will
show
up

kill
you
tell
me
if
the

took
away
the
voting
rights
of
everybody
who
exercised
their

would
that
then
be
proof
that
free

squelches

you
are
equating
two
things
with
each
other
that
dont

even
in
the

of

there
are
good
reasons
to
support

did

serious
if
he
would
ever
really
pay
attention
to
the
news
oops
i
forgot
that
the
media
for
the
most
part
loves
to
jump
right
on
top
of
a
story
before
all
the
facts
are
known
as
well
as
to
manipulate
what
we
see
and
thus
what
we
believe
any
ways
one
of
koreshs
devoted
followers
that
did
i
repeat
did
survive
this
genocidal
massslaughter
of
innocent
people
besides
there
are
nine
survivors
in
the
burnunit
of
the
local
hospital
and
was
reported
that
david
was
in
one
of
the
towers
when
the
shit
hit
the
fan
besides
a
majority
of
these
children
were
children
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
father
of
this
then
makes
them
bastard
children
to
a
sacraligious
zeloit
sp
also
someone
should
have
told
david
and
his
followers
that
if
they
cant
the
heat
then
they
should
stay
out
of
the
kitchen
pun
intended
so
if
you
werent
saying
that
the
deaths
of
bastard
children
of
a
sacreligious
zealot
was
no
big
thing
and
i
know
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
read
it
that
way
just
what
the
hell
were
you
saying
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
so
who
brainwashed
you
into
believing
that
whatever
the
government
says
it
the
truth
or
that
koresh
was
any
actual
threat
to
you
and
the
rest
of
the
us
havent
you
ever
stopped
to
wonder
why
the
government
raided
this
farm
this
raid
was
not
about
religion
sex
or
child
abuse
to
the
best
available
evidence
at
the
moment
this
raid
psychological
torture
and
group
death
was
about
koreshs
failure
to
pay
a
tax
on
one
grenade
launcher
that
he
may
or
may
not
even
have
had
thats
why
it
was
the
batf
doing
the
raiding
in
the
first
place
do
you
think
a
tax
evasion
justifies
an
armed
assault
by
the
government
with
armed
men
in
trailers
orchestrated
character
assassination
noise
torture
and
a
holocaust
i
am
however
sad
to
hear
of
the
death
of
any
child
unlike

we

suffice
it
to
say
that
i
disagree
both
with
the
interpretation
of
wellregulated

the

offered
by
gun
lovers
and
what
i
think
to
be
their
distortion
of
the
same
phrase
in
the
associated
federalist
papers
my
webster
and
my
reading
of
the
language
convinces
me
that
the
word
meant
both
under
control
and
disciplined
and
not
of
good
marksmanship
i
think
the
latter
a
special
interest
pleading
no
one
has
yet
shown
a
contemporateous
reference
in
which
well
regulated
unambiguously
meant
of
good
marksmanship
and
not
under
controldisciplined
etc
thus
i
continue
to
believe
the
second

is
a
militia
clause
and
not
an
arming
everyone
clause

are

shot

the

said
that
the

found
in

had
been
shot
and
several
children
were
also
the
two
people
found
today
were
on

of
the
main
inside
concrete

that
provided
the

karen
mcnutt
a
local
attorney
states
that
there
are
about
two
million
licensed
gun
owners
in
massachusetts
in
the
past
year
the
number
of
licensed
gun
owners
involved
in
gun
crimes
was
something
like
six
yet
there
were
a
large
number
of
gun
crimes
in
the
state
last
year
does
passing
laws
that
will
further
restricting
only
those
people
already
obeying
laws
pay
any
dividents
all
im
saing
is
that
guns
should
be
treated
with
respect
from
owners
sellers
and
legislators
so
far
ive
seen
them
treated
with
the
least
respect
by
legislators
i
believe
guns
are
a
problem
in
many
countries
and
that
crime
rates
would
fell
if
they
were
more
restricted
see
this
is
what
i
call
the
argument
from
religion
i
believe
dont
believe
its
not
necessary
to
take
this
on
faith
go
look
at
the
history
of
countries
that
passed
gun
restrictions
pay
particular
attention
to
whether
or
not
violent
crime
was
higher
before
the
restrictions
and
lower
after
dont
look
at
violent
gun
crimes
thats
begging
the
question
you
may
be
very
surprised
if
all
crimes
done
with
guns
stopped
and
all
accidents
also
stopped
or
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
then
i
would
consider
lifting
all
gun
control
you
have
this
absolutely
backwards
if
crime
stopped
in
the
presence
of
strict
gun
control
there
is
no
way
i
would
consider
lifting
any
of
it
however
if
gun
control
made
absolutely
no
improvement
in
the
violent
crime
rate
thats
when
i
would
have
it
lifted
think
about
it
so
far
none
of
the
stats
show
any
improvement
likevise
if
caraccidents
fell
to
a
minimum
in
europe
i
and
probably
most
people
i
know
would
demand
easier
driverstests
ca
hours
and
more
than
today
do
you
really
think
drivers
tests
are
any
indication
of
your
propensity
for
having
accidents
ive
never
known
anybody
stupid

take

thats
what
theyre
doing
when
they
have

i
have
heard
many
opinions
on
this
subject
and
would
like
to
hear
more
from
the
people
on
the
net
say
youre
in
a
situation
where
you
have
to
pull
a
gun
on
somebody
you
give
them
a
chance
to
get
away
but
they
decided
to
continue
in
their
action
anyway
and
you
end
up
shooting
and
killing
them
my
question
is
what
do
you
do
should
you
stay
and
wait
for
the
cops
or
should
you
collect
your
brass
if
youre
using
a
semiauto
and
get
out
of
there
provided
of
course
you
dont
think
that
you
have
been
seen
what
kind
of
laws
are
on
the
books
regarding
this
type
of
situation
what
would
be
the
most
likely
thing
to
happen
to
you
if
you
stayed

waited
and
it
was

what
would
happen

you
took
off

someone
saw
you
and
you
were
caught
anyone
jason
if
in
said
situation
i
would
reviewing
other
cases
ive
seen
reported
on
in
the
articles
ive
read
etc
suggest
the
safest
legal
course
of
action
is
as
follows
warn
your
assailant
loudly
and
in
clear
tones
that
you
have
a
weaponyeseven
though
its
blatantly
obvious
now
that
you
have
it
out
and
that
you
will
shoot
him
if
he
advancesdoes
not
cease
whatever
hostile
action
he
is
currently
involved
in
ie
drop
the
knife
or
ill
shoot
repeat
this
process
three
timesif
you
cannot
if
hes
pointing
a
freaking
gun
at
you
himselfthats
kinda
impractical
there
are
variables
here
and
i
will
try
to
address
them
in
turn
after
said
warning
considering
its
ignored
aim
center
mass
and
fire
until
he
drops
this
is
not
sadism
its
practicalityif
he
hasnt
gone
down
hes
still
a
threatwhy
i
support
if
he
turns
and
runs
do
not
pursue
or
fire
at
his
back
shots
fired
in
anger
will
burn
you
later
though
in
some
cases
the
i
can
see
where
that
might
not
bother
me
all
that
much
if
you
do
drop
him
remain
where
you
are

at

come
on
a
gun
kills
people
rather
people
kill
people
with
guns
the
sad
truth
is
sometimes
that
is
good
or
at
least
better
than
the
alternative
but
lets
ignore
guns
for
defence
andor
crime
and
look
at
gun
accidents
ok
there
are
about
fatal
firearm
accidents
per
year
and
the
number
has
been
in
decline
since
early
this
century
most
of
these
accidents
involve
rifles
or
shot
guns
not
handguns
but
seriously
a
gun
is
designed
to
fire
a
bullet
this
is
not
so
you
can
shoot
cardboard
cut
outs
down
at
the
range
in
fact
there
are
both
guns
and
bullets
designed
specifically
for
that
the
idea
that
my
ruger
mark
ii
bull
barrel
a
semiauto
caliber
handgun
was
designed
to
kill
or
hurt
people
even
for
self
defense
would
im
sure
come
as
a
surprise
to
its
designer
it
certainly
isnt
why
i
have
it
it
certainly
would
hurt
someone
if
you
shot
them
with
it
and
might
even
kill
them
but
it
is
simply
wrong
to
say
it
was
designed
to
kill
people
this
is
not
designed
to
act
as
a
tool
for
home
defence
where
you
show
someone
that
you
have
a
gun
and
they
go
gee
perhaps
i
should
leave
in
fact
that
is
what
happens
most
of
the
time
most
self
defensive
uses
of
firearms
dont
involve
firing
any
shots
most
criminals
would
prefer
not
to
be
shot
and
will
go
to
some
effort
not
to
be
including
doing
what
you
say
when
you
point
a
gun
at
them
if
you
were
called
on
to
design
a
tool
that
could
be
easily
carried
to
immediately
stop
someone
attacking
you
what
would
it
be
a
handgun
is
about
the
best
anyone
has
come
up
with
and
experience
shows
it
does
work
the
no
you
see
the
gun
was
designed
to
fire
that
little
bullet
into
a
human
body
and
hurt
them
not
a
tough
concept
to
swallow
for
most
certainly
no
one
argues
that
handguns
of
the
type
we
are
discussing
arent
deadly
weapons
however
it
simply
isnt
true
to
say
that
all
of
them
were
designed
to
kill
people
moreover
what
exactly
is
wrong
with
having
deadly
weapons
there
are
times
when
it
is
perfectly
legitimate
to
use
deadly
force
eg
in
self
defense
i
consider
it
not
just
my
right
but
my
duty
to
defend
myself
and
my
family
and
that
includes
having
and
knowing
how
to
use
the
tools
to
do
that
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a
last
resort
to
protect
themselves
against
tyranny
in
government
t
jefferson
i
think
what
jefferson
said
is
still
true
and
the
trouble
with
having
such
an
item
is
often
the
little
bullet
goes
off
into
the
wrong
fleshy
target
not
very
often
compared
to
other
or
else
uncle
frank
gets
pissed
and
blows
away
his
wife
this
isnt
that
common
either
at
least
when
compared
to
other
uses
it
is
very
rare
that
a
nonviolent
person
will
suddenly
getpissed
and
kill
someone
gun
or
not
in
most
cases
the
people
who
murder
have
long
histories
of
violence
if
you
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
these
people
wouldnt
kill
if
they
didnt
have
a
gun
feel
free
to
present
it
having
a
thing
specificly
designed
to
kill
means
it
is
much
easier
to
kill
things
right
right
but
there
are
times
when
killing
things
is
called
for
i
hope
i
never
have
to
shoot
a
person
but
ive
had
to
kill
a
number
of
animals
from
rodents
to
cows
and
when
i
do
i
dont
want
them
to
suffer
any
more
than
is
necessary
i
prefer
they
die
instantly
but
failing
that
i
want
them
to
drop
so
i
can
quickly
finish
them
with
the
next
shot
and
failing
that
i
dont
want
them
to
go
fast
or
far
i
try
to
choose
the
best
weapon
and
ammunition
i
have
to
try
to
achieve
that
goal
for
the
size
of
animal
im
after
but
it
doesnt
always
work
as
i
plan
without
belaboring

some

i

can
you

where
imho
these

wounds
were

caused

a
texas
ranger
does
not
a
pathologist
make
so
ill
wait
for
an
autopsy
to
determine
if
they
were
shot
first
i
would
doubt
bullets
would
go
flying
there
is
no
particular
force
to
make
the
bullet
leave
the
scene
of
a
cartridge
going
off
outside
of
a
barrel
the
brass
shell
would
burst
too
soon
to
give
the
bullet
any
real
velocity
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
near
it
but
i
do
not
think
bullet
wounds
would
result
shrapnel
wounds
would
be
more
likely
at
least
this
is
my
understanding
not
necessarily
if
the
body
had
been
denatured
cooked
or
dehydrated
due
to
the
heat
a
projectile
needs
only
a
minimal
kinetic
force
to
penetrate
in

aftermaths
bodies
tend
to
fall
apart
or
loose
large
chunks
of
meat
with
little
effort
medical
examiners
tend
not
to
like
cleaning
up
such
scenes
as
such
if
the
body
had
been
suitably
cooked
a
bullet
comming
from
a
magazine
explosion
would
more
than
likely
have
enough
force
to
enter
and
thus
it
would
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
bullet
entered
at
the
time
of
death
or
much
later

you
were

what

reasons
still
being

secret
a
federal
agency
already
known
well
enough
to
be
examined
and
rebuked
by
several
legislative
committees
over
the
years
for
a
longstanding
violent
disregard
of
the
law
invades
the
home
of
a
man
whose
religious

personal

they
abominate
violating
his
rights
under
the
first
second
fourth
fifth
ninth

fourteenth

followers
fight
back
killing
four
of
the
outlaw
agencys
minions
wounding
many
more
and
suffering
their
own
losses
in
the
process
the
agency
responds
by
cutting
off
his
electricity
water
and
especially
his
contact
with
the
outside
world
they
are
then
free
to
say
anything
at

about
him
in
pronouncements
that
contradict
one
another

itself
locked

bitter
power

with
another

eager
to
gain
credit
for
straightening
out
the
mess
and
more
importantly
to
script
his
side
of
the
subsequent

any

any

than
when
his
contact

was
severed
at
the
start
of
the
whole
travesty
a
leading
national
paper
claims
of
the
american
people
believe
that
a
man
who
resisted
a
savage
attack
on
his
home
is
somehow
responsible
for
everything
that
resulted
but
when
did
you
ever
know
of
americans
to
agree
on
anything
doesnt
this
sound
more
like
the
outcome
of
a
soviet
election
than
an
opinion
poll
very
well
what
can
we
infer
from
the
above
for
starters
never
forget
that
although
democratic
careers
are
on
the
line
and
rightfully
so
over
this
fiasco
by
the
outlaw
agencys
admission
it
was
planned
and
rehearsed
by
a
republican
administration
which
may
explain
why
paul
harvey
who
evidently
used
up
all
his
courage
and
integrity
changing
his
mind
at
about
the
same
time
i
did
about
the
war
in
viet
nam
has
been
acting
as
little
more
than
a
mouthpiece
for
a
state
that
has
no
regard
for
the
bill
of
rights
more
importantly
when
rush
limbaugh
whos
been
a
quivering
tower
of
jello
during
the
whole
thing
takes
essentially
the
same
stance
as
bill
clinton
its
time
for
fundamental
changes
if
not
in
the
system
then
at
least
within
yourself
on
march
back
at
the
beginning
mary
gingell
national
chair
of
the
libertarian
party
issued
a
press
release
condemning
the
outlaw
agency
and
calling
for
its
abolition
in
fact
the
lp
has
promised
in
its
platform
since
for
at
least
years
to
abolish
both
agencies
involved
in
waco
im
proud
to
say
i
was
there
and
helped
to
write
that
plank
true
the
lp
is
tiny
and
insignificant
although
less
so
than
in
ask
the
democrats
in
georgia
if
you
doubt
it
but
alone
in
a
howling
wilderness
of
fascists
scrambling
now
to
cover
their
behinds
with
phony
polls
and
big
lies
the
lp
is
right
about
what
happened
in
waco
and
if
their
advice
had
been
followed
in
waco
never
would
have
happened
think
about
it
and
think
about
the
fact
that
if
youve
had
enough
of
political
parties
more
interested
in
collecting
and
holding
power
at
whatever
cost
to
the
bill
of
rights
let
alone
human
life
than
in
defending
and
expanding
individual
liberty
maybe
the
change
its
time
for
within
yourself
is
to
make
the
lp
less
tiny
and
insignificant
by
a
single
voice
and
a
single
vote
think
about
it

my
own
subject
no
surrender
lenda
jackson
no
surrender
delivered
by
lenda
jackson
at
the
rkba
rally
in
denver
april
it
is
a
fact
of
modern
life
that
urban
residents
particularly
women
feel
threatened
a
certain
number
of
them
actually
are
threatened
there
are
immediate
threats
the
things
that
women
will
tell
you
theyre
afraid
of
the
noise
downstairs
at
night
the
lonely
walk
to
the
car
the
stranger
at
the
door
the
abusive
husband
finally
kicked
out
of
the
house
as
he
threatens
to
hurt
her
and
their
children
the
burglar
the
muggerthe
rapist
and
what
are
we
told
is
the
solution
move
get
a
dog
keep
the
door
locked
call
the
police
as
a
nexttolast
resort
learn
martial
arts
and
always
theres
the
implied
question
whats
a
pretty
little
thing
like
you
doing
without
a
husband
around
to
protect
you
but
what
if
you
dont
like
dogs
like
living
alone
dont
have
years
to
devote
learning
judo
what
if
after
examining
the
facts
a
woman
learns
that
rape
victims
using
armed
resistance
were
less
likely
to
have
the
rape
completed
and
were
less
likely
to
be
than
those
using
any
other
form
of
resistance
also
true
for
what
if
to
our
horror
and
despair
we
find
that
citizens
cannot
depend
on
the
police
for
effective
protection
they
usually
respond
after
a
crime
has
been
committed
in
truth
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
police
are
not
responsible
for
protecting
any
individual
only
the
whole
community
as
a
society
are
we
going
to
ask
women
once
again
to
sacrifice
themselves
are
we
going
to
continue
to
deny
women
the
ability
to
help
themselves
heres
a
thought
neil
smith
in
his
book
the
probability
broach
says
no
pound
thug
can
threaten
the
well
being
or
dignity
of
a
pound
woman
who
has
two
pounds
of
iron
to
even
things
out
but
if
a
woman
decides
to
protect
herself
with
the
easiest
most
efficient
means
possible
people
especially
other
women
are
horrified
eughh
how
could
you
id
be
terrified
they
ask
how
could
you
hurt
someone
theyll
repeat
the
lie
itll
just
get
taken
away
from
you
in
truth
of
defensive
gun
uses
result
in
the
offender
taking
the
gun
away
from
the
well
despite
the
lies
and
the
social
pressure
some
of
us
have
already
made
that
hard
choice
weve
decided
that
we
are
not
going
to
be
victimized
by
the
muggers
burglars
or
rapists
were
buying
more
guns
than
every
before
were
learning
how
to
use
them
and
teaching
others
women
and
men
how
to
use
them
most
importantly
we
are
preparing
ourselves
mentally
to
use
our
firearms
for
our
own
defense
were
taking
our
own
security
literally
into
our
own
hands
were
going
to
stop
begging
and
pleading
and
marching
and
what
we
intend
is
to
really
take
back
the
night
but
theres
another
threat
more
insatiable
than
any
mugger
more
secretive
than
any
burglar
more
souldestroying
than
any
rapist
that
menace
is
government
and
it
threatens
us
all
we
know
that
governments
throughout
time
have
suppressed
rights
and
oppressed
people
its
the
way
they
survive
in
our
names
and
with
our
money
it
interferes
with
innocent
people
both
at
home
and
abroad
it
lies
to
us
cheats
us
steals
from
us
and
threatens
us
with
violence
no
one
knows
exactly
what
itll
do
next
what
freedom
we
will
lose
because
some
government
goon
decides
its
for
your
own
safety
or
we
know
best
any
person
who
acted
like
government
does
would
be
psychoanalyzed
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
locked
up
as
a
habitual
offender
but
this
monster
called
government
persists
and
grows
and
we
who
should
be
its
masters
have
become
its
unwilling
slaves
do
you
doubt
me
then
why
did
you
file
your
income
tax
like
any
reasonable
person
i
believe
that
being
afraid
of
something
that
can
hurt
you
is
smart
and
that
paranoia
isnt
crazy
if
someones
really
after
you
and
make
no
mistake
theyre
after
you
and
theyre
after

if
were
lucky
theyll
settle
for
our
assault
rifles
our
shotguns
our

and
our
ammunition
as
citizens
we
have
only
two
choices
they
are
the
same
two
choices
given
to
women
to
surrender
or
to
fight
surrender
leads
to
the
gulag
to
the

of

to
the

i
do
not

a

be
philosophical
or
political
in
the
main
the
people
keep
the

honest
by
threatening
to
vote
it

if
they
have
to
they
will
keep
in

the
words
of
thomas
jefferson
the
tree
of
liberty
must
be
well
watered
with
the
blood
of
patriots
as
a
patriot
i
will
point
out
the
error
in
the
governments
ways
i
will
do
my
best
to
vote
the
villains
out
of
office
i
will
protest
and
write
and
speak
and
teach
our
children
justice
honor
and
truth
and
always
remember
that
rebellion
can
lead
to
bunker

and
saratogaor
it
can
lead
to

when
the
time
comes
to
stand
up
if
i
have
to
give
my
life
to
keep
them
from
going
too
far
if
there
is
a
tiananmen

in
our
future
i
intend
to
be
there
and
no
matter
what

they
tell
and
no

i

i
hear
about

getting

and
see
some
of
the

that
are

is
kratz
claiming
that
he
can
reliably
visually
distinguish

from
an
that
he
can
see
the
difference
between
a
semiauto

a

that
he
can

the
difference
between
the
various
versions
some
fullauto
some
semiauto
only
of
the
well
let
me
see
uzi
no
no
maybe
i
remember
there
being
a
selector
swtich
on
the
if
i
remember
correctly
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
position
or
an
on
position
because
the
gun
is
semiautomatic
wouldnt
the
have
a
position
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
maybe
round
bursts
if
this
is
correct
wouldnt
it
be
easy
to
distinguish
each
gun
by
this
alone
of
course
if
the
were
modified
to
fullauto
fire
i
wouldnt
think
it
would
be
that
easy
but
im
talking
about
distinguishing
between
an
unmodified
and
how
about
the
other
guns
do
they
also
have
selector
switch
to
switch
between
semiauto
and
fullyauto
fire
if
so
id
love
to
hear
the
details
if
only
because
theyll
demonstrate
that
kratz
is
blowing
smoke
considering
that
one
can
design
a
gun
so
that
it
looks
just
like
another
gun
yet
have
very
different
properties
and
that
thats
quite
common
most
kids
in
my
neighborhood
were
quite
young
when
they
figured
out
that
my
parents
car
wasnt
much
like
richard
pettys
even
though
it
looked
just
like
it
except
for
the
paint
job
things
must
have
been
different
with
kratz
actually
it
was
pretty
hard
for
the
kids
in
my
neighborhood
to
figure
that
out
as
richard
petty
lived
in
my
neighborhood
and
left
his
stock
car
in
the
driveway
sure
its
on
tv
but
why
does
that
make
a
difference
no
it
doesnt
but
thats
irrelevant
if
visual
inspection
of
the
outside
worked
tv
would
be
acceptable
but
since
it
doesnt
the
fact
that
its
just
as
good
as
seeing
in
person
doesnt
mean
much
well
what
about
what
i
said
above
if
that
is

in

and
by

in

in

i
dont

the
books
are
perfect
and
the
study
of
psychopathology
has
advanced
but
you
can
elicit
koresh
types
from
even
the
first
volume
so
i
think
theyre
onto
something
how
cult
psychology
works
im
an
amateur
hope
im
not
hopelessly
naive
so
long
as
koresh
could
own
his
people
he
made
sure
they
didnt
believe
there
was
any
life
out
there
for
them
away
from
him
otherwise
hed
koresh
be
nothing
during
the
siege
exdavidians
recounted
how
he
convinced
the
people
in
the
compound
they
survived
only
through
his
intercession
with
god
to
spare
their
worthless
souls
absolutely
classic
brainwashing
technique
as
long
as
they
believed
him
theyd
ignore
batffbichild
protective
services
or
even
the
red
cross
asking
them
to
come
out
after
all
if
they
ever
left
him
god
would
catapult
them
straight
to
hell
and
the
combined
forces
of
the
us
gummint
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
doubtful
couldnt
save
them
for
a
second
if
i
believed
it
id
stay
and
die
too
like
the
folks
in
jonestown
for
a
prosaic
analogy
replace
a
cult
leader
with
an
estranged
wife
or
husband
and
notice
how
many
folks
show
up
kill
the
ex
and
then
themselves
thats
the
consequence
of
shattered
cultism
it
really
does
happen
all
the
time
by
the
way
the
treasured
ideal
in
such
cases
without
which
life
is
meaningless
is
the
relationship
no
matter
how
abusive
rather
than
the
individuals
partner
why
no
news
dont
the
feds
owe
the
world
an
explanation
i
agree
that
official
explanations
are
in
order
i
can
also
see
good
reasons
for
news
blackouts
the
only
fact
available
is
that
had
the
fbi
not
acted
yesterday
those
people
would
be
alive
today
that
no
matter
what
those
people
would
have
died
because
koresh
made
sure
they
believed
they
had
no
lives
outside
his
influence
hence
it
would
make
little
difference
when
or
how
the
fbi
acted
he
held
them
hostage
as
his
trump
against
going
to
jail
but
nothing
would
really
stop
him
from
offing
them
even
if
the
fbi
went
away
look
at
history
rep
leo
ryan
and
some
staffers
visited
jonestown
at
the
request
of
constituents
who
had
relatives
there
once
jonestown
was
discovered
and
even
though
they
killed
ryan
and
his
entourage
they
all
killed
themselves
because
jim

knew
hed

arguments
asking
to
spare
the
children
brought
up
by
some
of
the
women
in

cult
were
shouted
down
there
are
tapes
the
logic
of
saying
that
no
matter
how
bad
the
gummint
is
it
wouldnt
kill
the
kids
was
shouted
down
as
blasphemy
and
the

who
brought

up
were
threatened
with
ostracism
by
people
who
by
their
own
avowal
would
be
dead
within

hour
i
suspect
its
the
same
with
the
branch
davidians
theres
a
book
on
jonestown
by
james
reston
jr
titled
our
father
who
art
in
hell
i
dont
know
whether
its
good
never
read
it
the
only
way
to
prevent
such
a
problem
would
be
never
to
investigate
reports
of
child
abuse
or
sexual
mistreatment
or
organizations
buying
fullauto
conversion
kits
or
shipping
hand
grenades
via
ups
on
the
off
chance
of
stumbling
across
cults
that
would
kill
themselves
so
the
only
way
the
batffbi
could
save
those
people
and
future
cults
is
by
ignoring
such
signs
i
suppose
theres
another
way
outsmarting
koresh
and
tricking
him
into
letting
them
go
or
somehow
influencing
his
people
to
abandon
him
while
he
owns
most
of
their
means
of
communication
with
the
world
a
mighty
tough
row
to
hoe
i
suspect
the
fbi
tried
to
do
that
with
blackouts
noise
and
other
sensory
insults
however
maybe
theyre
not
very
sophisticated
or
maybe
the
job
is
impossible
its
certainly
possible
the
guy
running
the
show
was
a
jerk
why
the
fbi
might
want
to
blackout
during
and
coverup
after
if
they
were
doing
a
poor
job
of
weaning
the
bds
from
koresh
theyd
want
to
keep
it
quiet
so
they
wouldnt
be
embarrassed
if
they
were
trying
to
wean
the
bds
from
koresh
theyd
want
to
keep
it
quiet
so
he
couldnt
outflank
them
or
wellmeaning
boneheads
from
any
point
of
view
wouldnt
screw
it
up
i
hate

chess
when
the

screams
in
my

especially
if
at
checkmate
time
people
really
die

i
could
be

i
dont

ignoring
such

is
a
workable
policy

you
deny

what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
my
god
a
sane
person
somebody
asking
intelligent
questions
rather
than
spouting
of
unsubstantiated
drivel
and
making
comparisons
to
nazi
germany
i
question
along
with
others
the
initial
raid
by
the
atf
there
are
some
definite
questions
needing
answers
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
probably
which
is
why
there
are
so
many
people
angry
at
the
initial
confrontation
why
attack
a
compound
with
as
many
people
in
that
compound
who
are
willing
to
die
for
their
leader
further
they
attacked
in
the
daylight
hours
without
proper
backup
medical
support
etc
that
was
rather
stupid
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
this
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atfs
initial
raid
i
believe
that
the
remainder
of
the
standoff
was
handled
fairly
well
with
the
single
exception
of
the
psychological
warfare
by
blaring
music
etc
i
think
that
was
uncalled
for
and
probably
hindered
the
outcome
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
see
above
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
agreed
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
which
is
actually
rather
refreshing
nowadays
most
of
the
time
the
higherups
claim
i
dont
remember
or
i
had
no

relay
of

seen
there
was
a
press
conference
by
authorities
at
the
compound
on
cnn
earlier
today
wednesday
it
was
explained
that
two
news
photographers
were
found
on
the
compound
earlier
this
morning
without
permission
it
was
explained
to
the
press
corps
that
this
is
dangerous
and
that
an
unknown
photographer
turning
around
with
a
long
lens
camera
could
be
mistaken
for
someone
dangerous
by
a
texas
ranger
surveying
the
site
the
two
photographers
were
said
to
be
currently
in
jail
and
the
press
were
warned
to
follow
the
authorities
guidelines
it
was
also
emphasized
that
the
survey
of
the
crime
scene
at
this
point
was
crucial
and
that
the
press
could
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
the
press
will
not
be
allowed
in
until
the
bodies
are
removed
and
the
site
has
been
completely
surveyed
for
evidence
for
a
court
case
that
is
the
gist
of
the
beginning
of
the
conference
to
the
best
of
my
memory
i
bring
this
up
because
i
havent
seen
anyone
else
note
it
and
i
havent
seen
the
regular
newscasts
mention
it
it
will
probably
be
mentioned
in
the
papers
tomorrow
my
opinions
i
find
this
disturbing
while
i
believe
that
koresh
is
largely
responsible
for
not
ending
this
standoff
in
a
peacable
manner
during
the
last
days
of
patient
opportunity
i
find
the
secrecy
surrounding
the
aftermath
more
damaging
to
the
authorities
position
than
they
realize
since
the
vast
majority
of
potential
defendents
in
a
court
case
are
already
dead
the
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
building
the
court
case
seems
overblown
to
me
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
hearings
on
this
affair
i
have
also
heard
congressional
calls
for
a
review
and
possible
overhaul
of
government
enforcement
agencies
which
you
will
recall
i
have

would

granted
it

but
clinton
had
no
more
to

perhaps
youve
been
under
a
rock
the
last
few
days
the
batf
and
the
fbi
are
both
federal

clinton
has
admitted
in

of
news
cameras
that
janet
reno
the
once
and
future
attorney
general
gave
him
a
full
briefing
of
what
was
planned
before
they
did
it
and
he
gave
her
the
go
ahead
maybe
just
possibly
that
makes
him
a
teensy
bit
responsible
the
fbi
cia
batf
etc
are
federal
agencies
you
are
correct
but
to
think
there
is
a
visible
and
clear
chain
of
command
up
to
the
prez
and
that
these
agencies
inform
reno
who
informs
clinton
etc
is
naive
these
agencies
operate
as
distinct
and
seperate
entities
and
while
they
have
ultimate
accountability
to
the
prez
they
make
their
own
moves
and
then
tell
the
prez
who
says
i
knew
all
along
while
this
may
not
seem
right
or
it
may
not
fit
our

need

i
do
agree
the

messed
up
im
not
sure
if
they
should
have
stormed
the
compound
or
not
by
the

jehova

protestantism
is
a

religion
in

bds
were
a
cult
by
all
definitions

history
of

to
say
this
is
not
to
persecute
a
religious

koresh
said
he
was

i
was

closemindedness

anyway
the

david
koresh
was

who
was
unjustly
persecuted

some

do

this

it

writes
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
tolerent
arent
we
theirs
was
hardly
the
first
faithsectcult
to
espouse
this
type
of
belief
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
i
keep
hearing
this
and
while
ill
agree
that
he
should
have
come
out
legally
that
was
his
best
option
he
didnt
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
legal
provision
for
were
tired
of
this
shit
lets
just
kick
some
ass
so
i
have
a
question
for
you
here
goes
i
come
up
to
you
and
point
a
gun
at
you
saying
im
going
to
count
to
ten
if
you
arent
standing
on
your
head
by
then
ill
kill
you
you
believe
that
standing
on
your
head
is
the
road
to
damnation
so
you
dont
do
it
you
are
now
dead
is
it
my
fault
for
shooting
you
or
youre

for
being

i
would
like

ask

a
few
questions
that
are
related
to
the
right
to
keep

bear

and
to
a

the
many
other

that

on

youre

you
call

how

defend

should
the

arise
while
you
are
waiting

to
arive
you
are
driving
your

home
when
your

breaks
down
a
good
samaritan
stops
to
help
when
you
find
you
and
your
family
at
gunpoint
or
knifepoint
how
will
you
defend
yourself
and
your
family
you
are
a
woman
walking
alone
to
your
car
or
home
a
man
appears
suddenly
with
the
intent
to
rape
you
how
will
you
defend
yourself
are
you
strong
enough
to
fight
off
your
attacker
are
you
willing
to
let
this
man
rape
you
in
order
to
survive
the
attack
if
the
house
and
senate
have
their
way
we
will
soon
not
have
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
as
provided
by
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
a
gun
may
not
be
the
answer
to
each
and
every
dangerous
situation
but
are
you
going
to
let
the
politicians
decide
what
sort
of
force
or
weapon
you
may
use
to
defend
yourself
and
your
family
many
times
a
situation
may
be
diffused
by
just
brandishing
your
handgun
if
certain
members
of
the
house
and
senate
have
their
way
and
ammunition
will
be
banned
for

of

the
purchase
of
a
handgun
when
his

or
family
members
have
been
threatened
our
local
police
do
an
excellent
job
but
they
can
not
be
there
all
the
time
or
in
a
moments
notice
you
should
have
the
right
to
protect
yourself
while
waiting
for
help
to
arrive
there
is
currently
legislation
circulating

decided

dan
sorenson
writes
that
really
depends
upon
where
you
draw
the
line
while
defining
these
weapons
this
means
you
would
support
a
ban
if
it
were
narrow
enough
good
very
narrow
very
very
narrow
if
youll
recall
i
was
the
nut
that
advocated
the
possibility
of
tactical
nukes
being
militia
weapons
in
certain
situations
how
can
you
possibly
define
what
is
a
weapon
and
what
isnt
is
only
the
start
of
this
and
also
on
if
you
intend
the
law
to
be
reflective
of
modern
practice
five
months
or
five
centuries
down
the
road
i
would
hope
so
lets
define
a
nuclear
weapon
as
an
explosive
weapon
whose
majority
of
energy
comes
from
fission
andor
fusion
of
atomic
nuclei
and
youve
just
described
any
civilian
reactor
because
your
definition
fails
to
note
what
energy
is
being
considered
reactors
blow
with
a
steam
explosion
but
the
majority
of
energy
still
comes
from
fission
or
fusion
because
that
is
what
heated
the
coolant
see
what
a
can
of
worms
this
is
last
i
heard
ft
calhoun
station
just
north
of
omaha
nebraska
wasnt
considered
a
weapon
given
the
sodiumcooled
breeder
designs
on
the
blocks
now
i
can
easily
envision
reactors
being
household
appliances
in
under
twenty
years
with
the
prism
design
there
is
no
operator
input
needed
on
the
reactor
itself
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
the
secondary
side
can
be
made
equally
as
automatic
in
the
future
so
your
definition
is
flawed
in
a
few
respects
already
lets
define
a
biological
weapon
as
live
organisms
or
viruses
in
such
state
quantity
and
with
such
a
vector
that
they
could
cause
death
or
serious
disease
further
defined
to
a
significant
number
of
people
if
released
in
a
city
similarly
populated
area
resevoir
or
cropland
typhoid
mary
would
likely
fit
this
bill
if
she
sneezed
if
you
dont
mind
extrapolation
any
hivpositive
person
also
fits
this
bill
if
they
interact
with
others
in
a
way
that
stands
any
chance
of
spreading
the
virus
finally
that
manure
pile
i
mention
below
fits
this
definition
as
does
say
releasing
a
pet
rattlesnake
to
the
wild
nerve
gas
and
mustard
gas
are
well
defined
other
poisonous
gasses
should
be
individually
banned
only
if
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
no
use
not
related
to
weaponry
licenses
should
be
available
for
research
purposes
on
such
chemicals
and
i
can
show
where
any
such
gas
has
other
uses
for
example
perhaps
we
would
like
to
rid
the
hay
field
of
gophers
calcium
carbide
is
a
rock
that
dissolves
in
water
to
produce
aceteylne
gas
it
can
be
used
for
welding
in
miners
lamps
for
gassing
gophers
or
for
making
carbide
bombs
and
doing
some
illicit
fishing
toss
some
in
a
toilet
and
leave
a
lighted
cigarette
on
the
seat
and
youll
see
that
it
can
also
be
a
weapon
just
like
any
other
flammable
substance
so
now
my
miners
lamps
wont
work
i
cant
do
any
welding
and
i
still
have
those
pesky
gophers
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
these
ideas
could
certainly
be
a
basis
for
definitions
the
basis
for
but
im
sure
you
see
that
the
problem
is
not
in
writing
a
law
it
is
in
writing
a
law
that
cannot
be
abused
and
extended
beyond
the
point
where
it
does
any
good
ill
give
you
a
little
hint
see
that
manure
pile
in
the
farmers
field
down
the
road
in
the
usa
that
is
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
nope
it
is
not
considered
a
weapon
it
is
under
your
proposed
law
so
is
a
silage
pit
if
there
is
runoff
so
are
underground
fuel
tanks
biological
in
nature
because
if
it
gets
washed
into
an
open
well
it
will
contaminate
the
aquifers
that
supply
thousands
of
cities
with
drinking
water
so
where
do
you
draw
the
line
in
the
usa
the
epa
has
ruled
that
a
pile
of
scrap
iron
is
illegal
care
to
draw
a
thinner
line
this
time
it
is
not
defined
as
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
many
things
are
banned
for
other
reasons
it
meets
all
the
criterion
of
a
weapon
it
is
an
instrument
that
can
be
used
for
fighting
even
though
that
is
not
its
intended
purpose
and
despite
there
being
better
weapons
around
given
that
the
aquifers
supply
a
significant
part
of
the
country
with
drinking
water
mass
destruction
is
rather
a
given
its
not
that
certain
weapons
arent
something
id
rather
not
see
a
lot
of
people
having
the
problem
is
that
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
write
a
law
such
that
it
cannot
be
abused
upon
some
pretext
or
another
the
looser
your
definition
the
more
ripe
for
abuse
that
law
is
furthermore
if
you
get
specific
then
the
old
standby
is
to
insert
a
clause
allowing
the
list
of
banned
things
to
be
added
to
generally
without
going
through
the
hassles
of
another
vote
and
public
reading
of
the
law

one

not

but
also
that
he

certain

hostile

one

the
waco
situation
of
course
this
was
all
set
up
after
the
incident
started
but
long
before
its
unhappy
conclusion
so
yesterday
i
went
to
hear
him
what
follows
is
a
rough
summary
of
what
i
think
i
heard
him
say
which
should
not
be
taken
as
exactly
what
he
actually
said
kates
started
by
saying
that
since
he
didnt
know
any
more
about
the
fire
than
the
audience
did
it
had
just
happened
the
day
before
he
would
not
discuss
that
but
would
concentrate
on
the
original
raid
koresh
definitely
was
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
but
so
what
this
isnt
the
first
time
that
the
leader
of
a
new
small
religious
group
has
been
ridiculed
by
the
public
extreme
religious
views
nearly
always
fuel
hatred
and
mistrust
the
first
amendment
applies
maybe
especially
to
people
like
koresh
lengthy
digression
into
the
history
of
police
organizations
in
the
us
there
were
none
until
about
when
they
began
in
metropolitan
areas
police
originally
were
not
armed
if
they
found
a
crime
in
progress
they
called
local
armed
citizens
to
help
many
began
to
carry
arms
for
protection
despite
regulations
against
them
eventually
the
laws
were
changed
to
allow
them
to
carry
guns
the
original
intent
was
to
have
many
small
police
departments
jealous
of
one
another
and
competitive
but
not
large
enough
to
be
a
threat
to
liberty
hence
the
plethora
of
organizations
ranging
from
postal
inspectors
to
the
coast
guard
when
the
fbi
was
started
agents
did
not
have
the
authority
oto
carry
guns
they
were
to
be
after
all
a
bureau
of
investigation
not
a
police
force
all
police
agencies
will
be
misused
by
anyone
in
power
to
maintain
that
power
the
batf
started
as
a
tax
collection
agency
whose
primary
job
was
to
raid
illegal
stills
when
the
price
of
sugar
went
up
so
high
that
moonshiners
no
longer
found
their
trade
no
longer
profitable
many
illegal
stills
disappeared
and
the
batf
needed
something
else
to
do
to
justify
its
existence
so
it
turned
to
activities
like
phony
raids
on
gun
stores
around
the
time
when
the
batfs
annual
budget
is
under
review
the
media
is
alerted
by
the
batf
to
come
to
suchandsuch
a
place
where
at
a
prearranged
time
a
bunch
of
cars
full
of
batf
agents
roar
up
to
the
door
and
the
media
get
great
pictures
of
the
agents
entering
the
premises
of
a
gun
dealer
suspected
of
not
keeping
books
properly
the
media
isnt
invited
in
for
the
boring
hours
of
agents
leafing
through
paperwork
but
if
any
irregularities
are
found
the
media
gets
to
cover
the
agents
removing
armfuls
of
guns
from
the
premises
and
the
luckless
ffl
in
chains
the
waco
incident
happened
a
few
weeks
before
batfs
budget
was
up
for
review
kates
opinion
is
that
it
was
a
staged
publicity
stunt
that
went
bad
and
that
the
batf
never
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
would
actually
be
shot
at
or
they
would
have
planned
the
raid
differently
not
sending
agents
over
open
ground
with
no
cover
for
example
and
would
have
had
some
medical
personnel
on
hand
he
confirmed
that
some
years
ago
there
was
a
warrant
for
koreshs
arrest
in
connection
with
a
murder
charge
and
the
local
sheriff
called
him
on
the
phone
and
explained
about
it
koresh
sais
ok
come
pick
me
up
and
the
sheriff
did
temporarily
confiscating
all
the
guns
so
that
they
could
be
tested
koresh
was
later
cleared
release
and
presumably
got
his
guns
back
at
least
at
that
time
he
was
rational
enough
to
be
approached
rationally
and
behaved
in
a
reasonable
manner
the
batf
didnt
take
into
account
that
unlike
most
of
the
ffls
they
audit
koresh
was
actually
paranoid
and
fostered
paranoia
in
his
followers
thus
the
pubicity
stunt
looked
like
a
real
attack
to
them
and
they
reacted
accordingly
with
respect
to
the
original
warrant
it
had
not
been
unsealed
when
kates
was
giving
his
talk
so
he
could
not
comment
on
it
except
to
mention
that
the
batf
has
been
known
to
not
doublecheck
the
veractiy
of
their
informants
if
they
can
manage
to
get
a
judge
to
issue
a
warrant
he
had
more
to
say
about
the
way
the
warrant
was
served
which
may
have
been
completely
illegal
apparently
the
proper
way
to
serve
a
warrant
is
to
knock
on
the
door
and
announce
that
youre
an
officer
with
a
warrant
for
thusandso
if
they
dont
open
the
door
and
the
evidence
is
flushable
then
it
is
ok
to
break
in
the
door
but
since
it
is
hard
to
flush
guns
down
the
toilet
there
may
have
been
no
justification
for
the
batf
breaking
in
the
way
they
did
if
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
davidians
were
violated
by
an
invalid
warrant
or
by
an
improperly
served
warrant
then
the
davidians
may
have
been
justified
in
their
actons
a
close
look
at
one
of
the
original
films
shows
that
one
batf
agent
may
have
shot
himself
by
accident
when
entering
the
building
if
so
this
was
the
first
shot
fired
the
role
of
the
media
could
have
been
a
whole
lot
worse
after
an
initial
position
on
the
side
of
the
batf
the
media
began
to
come
around
to
the
view
that
this
might
be
a
situation
in
which
legally
armed
citizens
held
off
a
bad
possibly
illegal
attack
a
real
cynic
might
say
that
the
fbi
went
in
when
they
did
because
it
was
clear
that
public
opinion
was
beginning
to
change
sides
and
the
fbi
wanted
to
act
before
they
lost
the
publics
sympathy
should
the
batf
be
abolished
no
police
agencies
should
be
numerous
diverse
inefficient
decentralized
etc
better
a
few
inept
accidents
like
this
than
a
move
toward
a
single
large
wellorganized
welltrained
powerful
domestic
police
force
which
would
eventually
have
even
more
tragic
results

the

abuse
that
janet

used
several
times
last
night
both
on

off

as
a
de
facto
justification
for
approving
the

if
that
is
to
be
used
as
a
justification
of
potentially
lethal
force
attack
on
the

and
doing
structural
damage
can
fairly
be
called
that
then
that
evidence
had
better
be
quite
strong
that
seemed
to
be
on
ted
kopels
mind
last
night
reno
stated
that
they
had
evidence
of
child
abuse
she
would
not
say
what
it
was
koreshs
now
exlawyer
was
inside
the
compound
repeatedly
and
told
her
to
her
face
last
night
that
he
saw
plenty
of
happy
children
playing
with
their
mothers
and
no
signs
of
child
abuse
whatsoever
no
brooding
silent
children
no
apparent
bruising
and
so
on
her
reply
to
this
was
that
child
abuse
is
not
always
as
evident
as
that
true
but
what
better
evidence
could
the
fbi
have
had
at
this
point
it
seems
difficult
to
see
how
the
fbi
could
have
had
better
evidence
than
that
seen
by
koreshs
lawyer
who
was
an
eye
witness
having
lived
in
la
and
seen
the
media
and
authority
feeding
frenzy
that
accompanied
the
mcmartin
preschool
debacle
i
have
seen
just
how
hot
a
button
a
child
abuse
charge
can
be
child
abuse
has
been
used
before
by
authorities
as
a
justification
to
discard
prudence
i
find
janet
renos
repeated
assertions
of
evidence
of
child
abuse
rather
curious
wasnt
the
warrant
issued
for
a
supposed
weapons
violation
that
certainly
had
nothing
to
do
with
child
abuse
are
we
to
assume
therefore
that
new
evidence
of
child
abuse
arose
after
the
issuance
of
that
warrant
and
the
initial
assault
if
so
i
fail
to
see
now
how
that
new
evidence
was
gathered
and
how
it

fbi
directors
statement

standoff
i
had
hoped
to
be
making
a
very
different
statement
this
evening
after
very
careful
planning
and
extensive
preparation
we
all
thought
that
todays
efforts
by
the
fbi
to
bring
the
branch
davidians
out
of
their
compound
would
result
in
the
peaceful
resolution
of
the
standoff
or
at
least
meaningful
negotiation
instead
we
are
faced
with
devastation
and
death
however
i
have
no
question
that
our
plan
was
correct
and
was
conducted
with
extreme
professionalism
and
care
i
applaud
the
restraint
shown
by
agents
in
the
face
of
lifethreatening
gunfire
and
i
thank
them
for
risking
their
lives
to
try
to
end
this
peacefully
i
have
only
the
greatest
admiration
for
the

months

knowledge

had

there

and
even
though
they
killed

they
all
killed
themselves
because
jim

knew

the
only
way

never

or
organizations
buying

shipping

via

on
the
off

of
stumbling
across

that
would
kill
themselves
so
the
only
way
the
batffbi
could
save
those
people
and
future

is
by
ignoring
such

the
paucity
of
this

is
that
it

false
texas
state
officials
could

did
investigate

they
could

did
apprehend

peaceably
the

koresh
was

convicted
note
that

similar
accusations
are
state
matters
not

the
state
could

did
handle
them
properly

peaceably

furthermore
violating
no
ones
constitutional

the

dont

any

not

the

waited

the

before
they
called

they
didnt

sincerely
hope
that
the

all

get
the
just
punishment
that
they
so
richly
deserve
someone
should
pay
for
this
needless
tragic
waste
of
human
life
sadly
these
evil
sobs
will
probably
never
face
justice
the
media
and
the
government
will
just
whitewash
this
incident
and
chalk
it
up
as
being
solely
david
koreshs
fault
sadder
still
the
american
people
will
probably
believe
them
next
question
the
problem
is
of
course
the
laws
that
allow
a
bunch
of
raving
nutters
to
collect
a
huge
stack
of
arms
in
the
first
place
this
is
not
the
problemthe
problem
is
that
we
have
a
government
that
is
becoming
more
tyrannical
every
day
if
people
decide
to
own
guns
and
live
in
one
place
together
then
that
is
their
prerogative
on
the
other
hand
if
the
bds
were
in
posession
of
explosives
and
illegal
guns
then
the
government
did
have
the
right
to
search
their
compound
but
the
allegations
that
the
bds
were
in
posession
of
illegal
weapons
hasnt
been
proven
yet
so
im
not
going
to
conclude
that
the
bds
broke
any
laws
david
koresh
was
accused
of
abusing
children
but
if
this
is
his
only
crime
then
the
presence
of
the
atf
cant
be
justified
the
atf
is
only
supposed
to
deal
with
firearms
tobacco
and
alcohol
violations
atf
agents
are
basically
cigarette
copsthey
should
stay
out
of
other
kinds
of
lawenforcement
actions
that
are
out
of
their
jurisdiction
better
yet
they
should
be
stcanned
imo
the
sequence
of
events
meant
that
there
really
was
no
option
but
to
attempt
some
sort
of
breakthrough
via
an
intervention
if
the
fbi
had
had
the
stomach
for
it
they
could
have
mounted
a
commando
type
raid
and
attempted
to
save
the
children
by
shooting
all
the
adults
sounds
like
something
the
ss
would
do
human
lifechildren
and
adults
alikeshould
be
treated
with
respecteven
if
they
are
heavilyarmed
religious
wackos
david
koreshs
lawyer
seemed
to
think
that
everyone
would
come
out
peacefully
sooner
or
later
the
fbi
and
atf
had
nothing
but
time
on
their
hands
why
did
they
have
to
escalate
the
situation
and
cause
this
senseless
tragedy
their
job
is
to
protect
the
public
and
save
lives
not
kill
people
for
crying
out
loud
it
really
was
a
no
win
situation
koresh
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
give
up
and
stand
trial
for
the
murder
of
the
atf
officers
instead
he
ordered
the
murder
of
the
children
dont
be
so
sure
about
that
i
read
in
a
newspaper
today
that
one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
when
one
of
the
tanks
went
through
the
wall
that
it
knocked
over
a
lantern
which
caused
the
ranch
house
to
be
caught
on
fire
this
cult
member
also
said
that
david
koresh
had
no
intentions
of
committing
mass
suicide
david
koreshs
lawyer
also
confirms
this
therefore
if
this
is
true
then
this
means
that
the
fbi
and
atf
murdered
everyone
in
that
house
even
if
this
is
not
true
the
fbi
and
atf
still
dont
get
off
the
hook
because
they
waited
a
damn
long
time
to
call
the
waco
fire
department
perhaps
they
wanted
all
these
people
to
die
in
order
to
reject
the
word
of
the
fbi
and
batf
it
is
neccessary
to
beleive
the
words
of
a
man
who
has
just
murdered
children
and
ordered
the
suicidemurder
of
his
other
followers
according
to
the
account
given
the
batf
attempted
to
serve
a
warrant
upon
koresh
at
the
ranch
and
were
met
by
gunfire
in
a
deliberate
attempt
to
murder
them
the
koreshgun
supporter
claim
that
the
batf
started
shooting
simply
does
not
stand
up
if
the
aft
had
gone
there
to
start
shooting
they
would
have
gone
with
heavier
grade
weaponry
than
standard
issue
handguns
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
unarmed
the
bd
followers
had
automatic
weapons
youre
wrong
on
several
accounts
atf
agents
were
adequately
armed
they
had
and
shotguns
some
agents
were
armed
with
automatic
pistols
but
not
all
were
the
atfs
initial
claimwhich
they
later
retractedthat
agents
were
underarmed
is
simply
ludicrous
the
bd
seige
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
indefinitely
the
bd
were
quite
capable
of
commiting
mass
suicide
and
murdering
the
children
at
any
time
a
commando
assault
was
the
only
other
likely
action
that
could
have
achieved
that
objective
that
would
have
been
very
risky
orders
of
magintude

antebbe
or
the
iranian

and
embassies
are
not
designed
for

against

ranch
apocalypse
was
terrorists
are
far
easier
to
disloge
without
casualties
than
allowing
the
siege
to
go
on
was
not
an
option
either
besides
the
serious
risk
that
koresh
would
proclaim
armageddon
at
any
moment
there
was
the
question
of
the
difficulties
of
keeping
the
emmergency
team
on
standby
over
a
prolonged
period
the
longer
the
siege
went
on
the
more
mentally
prepared
koresh
and
his
followers
would
be
for
a
prolonged
siege
rather
than
go
in
prematurely
the
mistake
was
probably
to
go
in
too
soon
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
of
getting
the
children
out
a
certain
way
the
people
who
do
not
want
gun
control
must
obviously
discount
the
entire
government
story
this
is
simply
rationalisation
it
is
not
enough
for
them
to
simply
dismiss
the
government
as
incompetent
that
would
require
them
to
come
up
with
a
solution
themselves
instead
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
government
conspiracy
theory
whereby
the
government
decided
to
set
out
to
murder
people
just
to
set
up
some
sort
of
scare
to
alow
them
to
get
gun
control
legislation
through
gun
control
isnt
the
only
issue
here
if
the
sick
little
monkeys
in
washington
try
to
use
the
waco
incident
as
a
reason
to
ban
guns
then
they
will
have
demonstrated
just
how
fed
up
they
are
what
concerns
me
much
more
than
new
gun
control
legislation
is
that
the
government
seems
to
be
able
to
get
away
with
st
like
they
did
in
wacothey
are
becoming
more
and
more
callous
about
peoples
rights
and
the
law
this
greatly
disturbs
me
and
it
should
disturb
you
as
well
this
conspiracy
theory
assumes
that
the
batf
deliberately
got
of
its
agents
killed
and
that
the
fbi
etc
actually
enjoy
sitting
out
in
the
middle
of
texas
being
shot
at
by
religious
nutters
still
the
conspiracy
theory
is
comforting
it
allows
them
to
pretend
that
waco
proves
nothing
except
about
how
incompetent
the
government
is
in
resolving
a
hostage
crisis
no
govt
in
the
world
has
ever
faced
a
comparable
situation
quite
probably
there
was
no
manner
in
which
it
could
be
peacefully
resolved
the
blame
does
not
rest
on
the
fbi
it
rests
on
the
fact
that
koresh
was
allowed
to
get
so
far
in
particular
the
person
who
tipped
the
bd
off
in
advance
has
the
murder
of
atf
agents
and
children
on
his
or
her
conscience
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
in
the
us
who
predict
the
end
of
society
preach
salvation
through
armed
security
the
fact
is
that
these
are
the
very
people
who
pose
the
threat
to
society
in
the
first
place
the
next
waco
may
not
be
religious
nutters
but
a
political
movement

splinter
group
of
the
klu
klux
klan
taking
over
a
schoolhouse
in
a
black
area
for
example
and
holding
several
hundred
children
hostage
the
only
possible
solution
to
such
situations
that
can
work
is
to
prevent
them
arising
no
other
government
in
the
world
has
faced
such
a
situation
this
is
because
no
other
government
has
so
carelessly
allowed
high
power
weaponry
to
become

i

whether

well

from

i
have

was

much
of

as

this
because
he
grew
up
inside
the
cult
and
engaged
in
a
power
struggle
where
his
supporters
helped
inflate
his
ego
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
a
loose
fucking
cannon
with
a
shitload
of
serious
weapons
or
that
he
was
banging
thirteen

twisting

this

kerosene

not

no

wasnt

i
expected
this
to

maybe
they
wanted
it

he

i

this
was

he
didnt

us
is
a
serious

firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause

unintentional
deaths
among

ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental

deaths
among

as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental

deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their

gun
from
their

drawer

accidently
blew

one

are
symbolic

in

why
you
think

my

was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the

are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the

of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a

not
necessarily
a

not
the

that
you
talk

violence

the

control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate

the
cphv
reports

bring

daily

at

the

high

at

in

latchkey
children
kids

time

these

were
the

of
the
people
inside

believed

would
you

worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put

in

situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead

letting
them

two
news
photographers
were
found
on
the
compound
earlier
this
morning
without
permission
it
was
explained
to
the
press
corps
that
this
is
dangerous
and
that
an
unknown
photographer
turning
around
with
a
long
lens
camera
could
be
mistaken
for
someone
dangerous
by
a
texas
ranger
surveying
the

nice

you

it
would

if
sometin

ta
happen
to
it
the
two
photographers
were
said
to
be
currently
in
jail
it
was
also
emphasized
that
the
survey
of
the
crime
scene
at
this
point
was
crucial
and
that
the
press
could
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
the
press
will
not
be
allowed
in
until
the
bodies
are
removed
and
the

has
been
completely
surveyed

opinions

find
this

good
keep

koresh
is

for
not
ending
this
standoff
in

i
find
the

more
damaging

position
than
they
realize
what
if
the
secrecy
is
actually
less

the

with

without

to
the
incident
simply
because
they
dont
fit
your
extremely
narrow
definition
of
good
how
is
clinton
responsible
it
was
a
law
enforcement
action
granted
it
was
a
nationally
covered
incident
but
clinton
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
outcome
than
fred
flintstone
perhaps
youve
been
under
a
rock
the
last
few
days
the
batf
and
the
fbi
are
both
federal
agencies
clinton
has
admitted
in
front
of
news
cameras
that
janet
reno
the
once
and
future
attorney
general
gave
him
a
full
briefing
of
what
was
planned
before
they
did
it
and
he
gave
her
the
go
ahead
maybe
just
possibly
that
makes
him
a
teensy
bit
responsible
the
fbi
cia
batf
etc
are
federal
agencies
you
are
correct
but
to
think
there
is
a
visible
and
clear
chain
of
command
up
to
the
prez
and
that
these
agencies
inform
reno
who
informs
clinton
etc
is
naive
these
agencies
operate
as
distinct
and
seperate
entities
and
while
they
have
ultimate
accountability
to
the
prez
they
make
their
own
moves
and
then
tell
the
prez
who
says
i
knew
all
along
while
this
may
not
seem
right
or
it
may
not
fit
our
idealistic
need
to
see
a
structured
chain
of
command
leading
to
the
white
house
thats
the
way
it
is
bureaucracys
are
not
after
all
composed
of
or
people
who
talk
on
a
regular
basis
have
lunch
and
maybe
golf
together
i
do
agree
the
fbi
batf
messed
up
im
not
sure
if
they
should
have
stormed
the
compound
or
not
by
the
way
jehova
witnesses
are
a
religious
minority
in
this
country
protestantism
is
a
minority
religion
in
the
world
bds
were
a
cult
by
all
definitions
and
history
of
cults
to
say
this
is
not
to
persecute
a
religious
or
ethnic
enclave
koresh
said
he
was
the
messiah
i
was
raised
a
baptist
although
i
do
not
practice
the
religion
and
do
not
think
that
the
big
guy
upstairs
is
digging
the
divisiveness
closemindedness
and
rightwing
morons
that
are
associated
with
the
religion
anyway
the
messiah
that
i
was
taught
about
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
let
alone
stockpiling
weapons
you
can
doubt
batf
reports
all
you
want
david
koresh
was
not
a
poor
soul
who
was
unjustly
persecuted
while
some
of
the
information
coming
from
the
us
government
is
being
exagerated
so
as
keep
public
opinion
on
their
side
i
do
believe
that
some
of
the
things
that
former
cult
members
have
said
are
true
anyway
this
is
just
another
excuse
to
try
and
blame
president
clinton
for
something
people
who
attempt
to
do
this
for
political
motives
should
be
ashamed
they
are
the
ones
who
are
keeping
this
country
from
reaching
its
full
potential
you
seem
to
make
two
points
no
one
ultimately
oversees
the
federal
agencies
you
mention
and
since
koresh
apparently
has
a
different
view
point
from
your
baptist
upbringing
then
he
is
not
worthy
of
protection
from
religious
persecution
as
to
being
the
messiah
is
not
christ
within
us
all
must
be
comforting
to
belong
to
a
government
approved
religion
baptists
are
a
cult

the

horse
trailers
men
ninja
uniforms
machine
guns
and
stun
grenades
and
used
them
before
koresh
could
even
look
at
the
warrant
koresh
fought
back
and
people
died
the
key
part
of
this
sentense
is
koresh
fought
back
this
was
his
big
mistake
when
the
police
decide
to
exert
their
authority
over
you
you
dont
fight
back
unless
you
want
people
to
get
hurt
you
cease
all
resistance
and
signal
your
submission
to
their
authority
the
cops
they
are
the
boss
you
are
the
subject
the
concept
of
defense
against
illegal
action
under
color
of
law
is
kaput
no
longer
is
it
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
its
government
of
the
people
by
the
biggest
guns
the
idea
of
sorting
it
out
in
court
later
is
fine
but
one
has
to
get
to
court
in
one
piece
to
do
that
korash
had
good
reason
to
think
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
that
chance
see
below
arent
in
it
to
beat
up
and
kill
people
in
spite
of
the
actions
of
a
few
bad
apples
if
you
quit
resisting
they
quit
hitting
perhaps
the
batf
did
over
react
to
the
threat
posed
by
koresh
perhaps
they
did
use
too
much
force
ok
fine
im
willing
to
concede
to
that
point
if
sufficient
proof
is
produced
and
i
admit
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
indicate
this
however
resisting
the
batf
is
the
worst
thing
koresh
could
have
done
if
they
hadnt
resisted
there
is
a
good
chance
that
no
one
would
have
been
hurt
remeber
they
were
using
stun
grenades
not
antipersonnel
grenades
if
the
bds
were
not
in
violation
of
any
rember
korash
didnt
get
to
sort
this
all
out
serenely
typing
at
his
keyboard
he
heard
some
kind
of
explosives
go
off
he
saw
he
was
being
attacked
with
no
overt
action
from
him
yet
he
could
no
more
say
oh
its
ok
its
only
stun
grenades
anymore
than
i
could
he
slammed
the
door
at
that
point
and
proceeded
to
repel
the
attackers
he
felt
in
genuine
fear
of
his
life
i
know
i
would
be
in
fear
of
my
life
at
that
point
have
you
ever
been
shot
at
how
clear
and
logically
could
you
think
under
that
pressure
when
you
might
have
all
of
or
seconds
to
evaluate
what
is
going
on
and
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
law
enforcements
intended
to
bring
in
their
suspect
horizontally
for
all
we
know
he
was
informed
by
someone
saying
something
like
hey
guy
the
batf
is
coming
like
gangbusters
and
they
mean
to
waste
you
according
to
the
latest
news
the
released
warrant
so
we
are
told
said
the
reason
for
this
ww
iii
raid
was
that
korashs
group
had
spent
around
on
firearms
and
related
stuff
over
an
undetermined
period
now
even
assuming
that
the
figure
isnt
calculated
like
the
feds
do
a
drug
siezure
for
people
that
isnt
really
all
that
much
you
priced
decent
guns
lately
hell
i
can
think
of
a
person
right
now
that
probably
has
that
much
for
one
individual
mostly
machineguns
sure
he
is
an
avid
collector
but
unless
a
new
law
has
been
passed
it
is
not
illegal
nor
an
indication
of
anything
illegal
to
have
a
lot
of
guns
also
note
that
the
warrant
had
nothing
to
say
about
machine
guns
so
what
is
the
justification
of
this
cowboy
raid
other
than
a
romp
gone
bad
for
some
antigun
media
hype
to
support
clintons
push
for
disarming
the
unconnected
citizen
of
any
and

that
accidental

us
is
a
serious
problem
firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental

is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
any
death
is
serious
wanna

firearms
related
unintentional

among

and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
negligent
persons
not
the

more
than
anything
gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
providing
false
hope
then
is
the
intent
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to

at

once
in

also
says
that

eh

is

thus
willing

got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive

does

doesnt

small

large

not
the

mostly
from

this
is
also

in

no
more
risk
than
smaller

unless
the

is
somehow
confined

the

from
early
ignitions
could
somehow
bulkheat
the
remainder
two
years
ago
this
month
my
house
and
office
burned
in
my
office
was
my
reloading
bench
on
the
top
shelf
next
to
the
wooden
ceiling
was
about
lbs
of
smokeless
powder
lbs
of
black
powder
several
thousand
primers
and
a
couple
thousand
loaded
rounds
primarily
in
and
the
fire
was
extinguished
before
the
area
containing
the
reloading
supplies
were
fully
involved
there
was
about
of
char
on
the
joists
subsequently
removed
by
sandblasting
lots
of
heat
in
other
words
none
of
the
powder
kegs
ignited
one
can
of
pistol
powder
ignited
no
explosion
as
the
can
opened
at
the
seam
as
it
was
designed
to
do
the
black
powder
cans
were
charred
and
got
so
hot
the
plastic
lids
completely
melted
and
ran
down
inside
the
smokless
powder
was
contained
mostly
in
lb
cardboard
or
metal
kegs
the
kegs
were
charred
badly
enough
that
the
paper
labels
burned
completely
off
and
in
the
case
of
the
metal
cans
the
plastic
lids
melted
completely
away
many
of
the
rounds
cooked
off
they
were
in
close
proximity
to
wood
on
all
sides
so
the
effects
were
easy
to
observe
in
most
cases
with
the
rifle
ammo
the
cartridge
cases
ruptured
in
the
middle
many
bullets
were
found
still
in
the
neck
small
shards
of
brass
were
lightly
stuck
into
the
wood
lightly
enough
that
brushing
them
with
a
fingertip
would
usually
dislodge
them
primers
generally
popped
out
of
the
primer
pockets
the
rounds
that
cooked
off
left
empty
cases
and
bullets
laying
around
no
dents
were
observed
above
the
storage
area
indicating
the
bullets
left
the
cases
slowly
enough
not
to
be
a
hazard
ordinary
small
arms
ammo
is
not
a
hazard
when
cooking
off

his

it
all
who
the
hell
are
we
or
the
government
to
judge
their
religion
as
wrong
this
event
i
hope
will
be
recorded
in
history
as
the
american
holocaust
these
people
were
murdered
by
the
us
government
just
as
surely
as
the
jews
were
by
the
nazis
i
hang
my
head
in
shame
for
what
ive
allowed
my
government
to
become
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
last
time
i
checked
amassing
an
arsenal
and
practicing
any
kind
of
religion
were
mentioned
in
passing
in
the
bill
of
rights
guess
its
ok
with
you
if
we
just
brush
em
aside
in
order
to
justify
killing
a
bunch
of
religious
nutcakes
eh
of
all
the
idiots
i
run
into
in
daily
life
dan
your
type
scare
me
the
most
youll
accept
expediency
and
a
cowards
safety
over
any
belief
just
as
long
as
the
government
tells
you
to
you
assume
that
anyone
who
doesnt
comform
to
your
beliefs
and
ways
of
thinking
are
wrong
and
therefore
bad
worse
you
seem
to
accept
without
question
what
the
government
says
is
wrong
to
be
wrong
david
koreshs
religion
was
not
mine
but
then
again
neither
are
the
baptists
methodists
catholics
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
corporate
religions
but
even
though
koreshs
the
baptists
the
methodists
etc
dont
believe
the
same
way
i
do
i
recognize
that
their
religions
are
equally
valid
to
mine
and
more
importantly
are
equally
protected
under
the
amendment
you
see
im
not
that
much
different
than
koresh
and
i
suspect
many
others
fit
the
same
catagory
i
read
the
bible
many
times
and
as
i
learned
from
it
i
discovered
that
a
lot
of
what
corporate
religions
practice
just
isnt
justified
by
my
interpretation
of
the
bible
therefore
i
go
my
own
way
so
did
koresh
and
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
either
individually
or
collectively
as
the
great
socialist
we
has
any
right
whatsoever
to
tell
me
or
you
or
koresh
that
our
religions
are
wrong
you
seem
to
think
that
it
would
have
been
oh
so
easy
for
the
davidians
to
just
forsake
everything
they
believed
in
and
walk
out
of
their
compound
in
order
to
save
themselves
think
if
youre
capable
for
a
moment
about
some
belief
you
hold
dearest
would
you
abandon
that
belief
if
suddenly
told
to
do
so
by
the
government
if
you
would
do
so
you
are
beneath
contempt
lets
assume
you
have
a
belief
that
you
hold
dear
enough
to
commit
your
life
to
do
you
think
it
would
be
the
correct
course
of
action
for
your
government
to
initiate
actions
specifically
designed
to
force
you
to
make
that
forsake
or
die
decision
the
forsake
or
die
option
is
exactly
what
the
government
forced
on
the
davidians
the
day
the
first
wave
of
blackclad
stormtroopers
fired
that
first
shot
and
tossed
that
first
grenade
the
fbi
clenched
it
on
day
when
they
sent
in
heavy
armor
against
men
women
and
children
holed
up
in
a
rickety
old
building
and
armed
with
small
arms
the
people
who
stayed
who
held
to
their
beliefs
over
personal
safety
whose
individual
personal
honors
demanded
they
die
rather
than
submit
who
believed
that
the
bill
of
rights
meant
exactly
what
it
says
to
those
people
go

deepest
respect

of
their

blithely

turned

there

apparently
they

oldham
what
happened
in
waco
is
not
the
fault
of
the
batf
if
they
would
of
had
the
proper
equipment
and
personal
then
they
could
of
captured
the
compound
on
the
initial
assault
and
none
of
this
would
of
happened
they
did
have
the
proper
equipment
the
problem
is
that
they
went
about
things
the
wrong
way
the
atf
should
have
served
the
warrant
in
a
peacable
manner
instead
of
going
in
there
like
a
bunch
of
rambos
with
guns
blazing
im
not
trying
to
excuse
what
david
koresh
did
im
just
saying
that
the
atf
henceforth
to
be
known
as
the
cigarette
cops
went
about
the
raid
in
an
improper
manner
the
batf
needs
more
people
better
weapons
and
more
armored
transports
when
they
meet
hostile
fire
they
should
be
able
to
use
more
force
instead
of
retreating
to
a
stand
off
if
you
are
going
to
do
a
job
then
do
it
right
the
batf
is
there
to
protect
us
and
they
must
have
the
proper
equipment
and
people
to
do
the
job
let
the
fbi
customs
and
local
police
officers
do
the
atfs
job
we
dont
need
them
anymore
the
cigarette
cops
are
just
leftovers
from
prohibition
days
they
are
an
anachronism
with
the
wod
and
the
increased
crime
in
the
streets
the
batf
is
needed
more
now
then
ever
if
they
blast
away
a
few
good
fokes
then
that
is
the
price
we
all
have
to
pay
for
law
and
order
in
this
country
look
at
all
the
good
people
that
died
in
wars
to
protect
this
great
country
of
ours
including
you
what
if
the
cigarette
cops
kicked
down
your
door
and
cut
you
in
half
with
a
machine
gun
this
could
actually
happen
maybe
they
get
the
wrong
address
and
then
raid
your
home
for
example
its
happened
before
and
it
can
happen
again
i
have
heard
of
more
than
one
instance
of
a
noknock
raid
going
sour
just
recently
i
heard
about
a
case
in
which
police
raided
this
guys
home
because
they
thought
he
had
dope
or
something
the
guy
blew
both
of
the
officers
away
and
he
didnt
go
to
jail
for
it
the
judge
hearing
the
case
ruled
that
the
man
was
acting
in
selfdefense
with
the
arms
build
up
in
waco
they
needed
to
hit
that
compound
with
mega
fire
power
they
could
of
gone
in
there
blasting
and
killed
a
few
women
and
kids
but
it
would
of
been
better
then
letting
them
all
burn
to
death
days
later
are
you
sure
that
that
would
have
been
the
way
to
go
surely
the
fbi
and

could
have
handled
this
fiasco
better
they
didnt
have
to

all
those
people

nobody
seems
to
be
talking
about
a

at

at
the

there
were
a

of
bad

that
went
into
this

some

may
now
be
taking

for
the

actually
the

i

are
the

raving
about
deranged

with

and
suicide
pacts
admittedly
mistakes
were
made

why
attribute
them

rather
than
stupidity
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
us
that
have
been
following
this
pretty
closely
from
the

we
woud
probably
agree

dave

does
that
include
the
right
to
murder
little
children
how
about
killing
atf
officers
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
gun
laws
in
texas
but
koreshs
folks
claimed
to
have
grenades
grenade
launchers
and
rocket
launchers
i
am
not
sure
that
the
nra
feels
that
this
falls
under
right
to
bear
arms
if
the
waco
wackos
truly
had
grenade
launchers
and
rocket
launchers
why
werent
they
used
against
the
armored
vehicles
that
attacked
their
house
all
the
media
stated
was
that
small
arms
ie
ineffective
fire
was
used
against
them
i
noticed
that
too
special
agent
asshole
actually
ricks
stated
that
david
koresh
had
explosives
that
could
blow
up
an
armored
vehicle
feet
into
the
air
it
looked
like
to
me
that
the
bds
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
use
these
explosivesprovided
that
they
had
them
in
the
first
place
for
example
when
one
of
the
tanks
was
injecting
cs
gas
into
the
ranch
house
yes
ranch
house
the
bds
werent
living
in
a
fortress
they
could
have
easily
destroyed
or
disabled
that
tank
because
it
was
idling
there
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
so
why
didnt
they
do
this
could
it
be
that
they
didnt
have
any
explosives
or
similar
munitions
i
just
dont
buy
what
the
atf
and
fbi
have
been
saying
hopefully
the
truth
will
come
out
heres
something
noteworthy
after
the
fire
had
been
burning
for
some
time
an
explosion
occurredjust
one
explosion
the
media
said
that
this
was
some
of
the
explosives
that
the
bds
posessed
going
off
i
dont
think
this
was
the
case
my
brother
and
i
noticed
that
this
socalled
explosion
resembled
a
plume
of
propane
gas
being
ignited
we
figure
that
this
is
what
it
was
because
of
how
the
explosion
looked
and
sounded
obviously
it
wasnt
due
to
something
like
tnt
dynamite
or
i
have
seen
a
propane
explosion
beforethe
explosion
in
the
ranch
house
greatly
resembled
this
also
i
noticed
something
that
looked
like
a
propane
tank
in
the
charred
ruble
the
next
day
isnt
it
curious
that
the
atf
wasnt
very
forthcoming
about
how
the
four
officers
got
killed
many
weeks
had
gone
by
before
they
stated
that
some
of
the
officers
had
been
killed
andor
wounded
by
grenades
thrown
by
the
bds
earlier
when
someone
asked
one
of
the
spokespersons
about
whether
or
not
an
autopsy
had
been
performed
on
the
slain
agents
they
said
that
an
autopsy
had
been
done
but
they
werent
ready
to
release
the
findings
now
why
is
this
does
the
atf
have
something
to
hide
perhaps
those
four
agents
were
killed
by
friendly
fire
what
is
the
cause
of
death
exactly
no
one
has
ever
said
what
it
is
what
is
certain
is
this
atf
agents
did
throw
grenades
into
the
compound
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr
koresh
handed
his
lawyer
a
grenade
body
during
one
of
the
lawyers
visits
to
the
compound
later
on
the
lawyer
gave
the
grenade
body
i
dont
know
if
it
was
a
dud
or
a
spent
one
btw
to
the
atf
how
much
do
you
want
to
bet
that
this
grenade
will
mysteriously
disappear
at
this
point
in
time
the
only
people
we
know
who
had
grenades
was
the
atf
agents
wouldnt
it
be
a
shocker
if
the
no
one
ever
found
any
evidence
of
grenades
rockets
or
explosives
in
the
rubble
the
atf
would
sure
have
egg
on
their
face
then
note
that
the
atf
is
doing
the
initial
sweep
of
the
rubble
the
fbi
and
the
texas
rangers
wont
investigate
until
the
atf
is
done
this
looks
like
a
perfect
opportunity
for
the
atf
to
make
sure
that
others
find
what
they
want
for
them
to
find
if
you
know
what
i
mean
im
probably
being

paranoid
here
but
if
i
am

have

several
weeks
had
gone

said

doesnt

saying
that
the
type
of

used

had
been

from

use
its
use
is
also
banned
by
a
draft
international
agreement
on
the

given
was
that

much
harm
to

although
i
wouldnt

it
in

on

in

the

are
greatly
intensified
to
the

lethality
since
a

quantity
of

will
displace
oxygen
when
running

careful

is

i
wonder
if
they
checked
to

if
any
of

were
asthmatics
or
suffered
from
other

diseases
i

it
if

youd
have

subject
two
questions
id
appreciate
any
help
anyone
could
give
me
on
these
two
questions
the
brady
bill
was
in
the
news
throughout
but
what
actually
happened
to
it
in
congress
did
bush
veto
it
if
so
when
also
the
state
of
virginia
i
believe
just
passed
a
gun
control
bill
on
febrauary
of
this
year
i
think
it
limits
gun
purchases
to
one
a
month
is
this
correct
what
was
the
bill
number
anyone
subject
batf
fbi
do
right
thing
in
waco
everyone
is
complaining
about
the
debacle
in
waco
it
is
hard
to
understand
all
this
angst
what
happend
there
is
nothing
less
than
what
we
wanted
to
happen
why
all
the
sour
grapes
batf
was
looking
for
a
propaganda
event
to
counteract
their
impending
budget
cuts
the
attendance
of
the
press
at
the
initial
big
commando
raid
is
proof
it
would
have
been
ever
so
easier
to
grab
koresh
and
his
central
followers
as
they
shopped
in
waco
alas
no
propaganda
value
there
the
fbi
screwedup
big
time
all
the
time
they
should
have
never
allowed
the
situation
to
drag
out
like
that
a
quick
second
assault
before
the
bds
could
decide
on
a
strategy
would
have
been
the
better
plan
the
bds
themselves
were
the
biggest
screwups
though
they
imagined
that
us
law
and
us
lawenforcement
had
no
jurisdiction
within
their
little
country
wrong
they
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
fire
on
the
batf
and
if
they
mistook
their
identity
initially
they
should
have
surrendered
at
once
when
they
did
realize
who
they
were
if
the
bds
had
a
problem
with
the
warrants
they
take
it
to
court
just
like
the
rest
of
us
if
they
wanted
fullauto
weapons
they
could
have
obtained
the
proper
permits
just
like
the
rest
of
us
would
need
to
do
what
they
may
not
do
is
decide
for
themselves
what
us
law
applies
to
themselves
and
which
does
not
they
get
their
chance
like
the
rest
of
us
at
the
voting
booth
if
the
batf
and
fbi
have
become
latterday
gestapo
then
they
have
become
that
way
because
we
have
desired
them
to
be
so
we
get
to
vote
on
laws
and
on
the
lawmakers
by
our
choices
over
the
years
we
have
approved
the
creation
and
form
of
the
batf
and
fbi
when
the
fbi
was
out
chasing
pinkos
the
general
public
didnt
seem
to
mind
a
bit
of
extraconstitutional
activity
when
the
batf
is
raiding
militant
black
organizations
we
dont
mind
the
heavy
hand
when
the
fbi
is
dicking
around
with
the
rights
of
potheads
the
public
doesnt
mind
suddenly
when
we
see
a
bit
of
ourselves
in
the
current
enemy
choosen
by
these
agencies
we
get
all
bent
out

shape
suprise
you
reap
what
you
sow
waco
was
an
encapsulation
of
the
allamerican
experience
religious
fanaticism
militaristic
thinking
and
overwhelming
violence
dont
blame
it
on
them
the
fbi

they
were
just
acting
within
the
parameters
we
have
set
over
the

where
govt
spoksewoman
the

general
known
to
be
almost
rabid
about
private
ownership

wants
to
ban
assault
guns
and
just
about
everything
else
is
saying
the
fbi
had
amazing
restraint
then
falls
back
into
the
official
goverenment
line
about
how
the
bd
were
guity
of
child
abuse
and
were
into
it
in
an
ongoing

and
so
on
am
i
having
a
vain
hope
that
an

will
occur
on

will
it
simply
be

police
i
wonder
what
a
load
of
crap
the
bds
had
absolutely
no
right
to
fire
upon
the
batf
agents
if
they
didnt
know
who
they
were
at
first
then
they
should
have
surrendered
immediately
when
they
did
realize
who
they
were
dealing
with
little
groups
of
loonies
do
not
get
to
decide
just
what
laws
they
will
obey
or
disobey
or
what
sorts
of
warrants
are
justified
like
the
rest
of
us
they
get
their
say
at
the
voting
booth
and
if
their
personal
wants
are
not
backed
by
the
majority
of
voters
then
too
bad
if
they
wanted
to
keep
automatic
weapons
then
they
could
apply
for
the
proper
permits
if
they
had
a
problem
with
the
warrant
then
they
get
to
argue
that
in
court
in
no
event
do
they
get
to
establish
their
own
little
nation
inside
our
own
and
pretend
that
our
laws
and
lawenforcement
personel
have
no
jurisdiction
within
their
borders
you
live
on
us
territory
you
live
by
us
laws
period
unless
you
are
a
congressman
sure
the
situation
was
handled
badly
by
both
the
batf
and
the
fbi
it
would
have
been
all
so
easy
to
detain
koresh
and
his
core
members
while
they
were
out
in
the
streets
of
waco
the
batf
threatened
with
budget
cuts
was
trying
for
a
propaganda
coup
and
dragging
the
press
along
for
the
big
commandostyle
assault
is
proof
of
that
they
should
be
roasted
for
both
their
imcompetance
and
their
mindset
on
the
other
hand
they
did
have
the
legal
right
to
do
what
they
did
once
the
attack
was
begun
they
should
have
pressed
on
and
finished
it
rather
than
let
an
interminable
situation
like
that
take
root
the
fbi
also
used
poor
judgement
in
a
number
of
ways
but
again
the
laws
we
voters
have
approved
or
the
lawmakers
who
created
them
gave
them
the
right
to
do
what
they
did
if
batf
and
the
fbi
are
latterday
gestapo
it
is
because
the
voters
have
allowed
them
to
become
that
way
waco
was
pure
americana
militarist
mentality
religious
fanaticism
and
unadulterated
violence
all
rolled
into

thats

says
from

according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
and
just
where
is
the
evidence
for
this
fbi
sayso
the
texas
medical
examiner
refuted
of
their
lies
today
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
let
me
put
you
in
a
building
pump
in
cs
knock
the
walls
down
around
you
and
see
how
fast
you
find
an
exit
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
i
dont
know
why
either
youre
willing
to
swallow
everything
fed
you
good
boy
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
oh
a
clinton
apologist
why
didnt
you
say
so
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
if
people
will
believe
that
of
any
politican
it
is
little
wonder
they
will
believe
all
of
the
factoids
being
given
out
as
fact
by
the
clintonrenofbibatf
confederation
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a

of
the

to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that

im

they

andy
freeman
says
this
is
where
freemans
love
of
accuracy
becomes
really
ridiculous
good
now
lets
look
at
those
sections
theyll
prove
my
point
his
point
was
that
it
is
possible
under
certain
circumstances
for
many
people
to
carry
concealed
in
illinois
a
a
person
commits
the
offense
of
unlawful
use
of
weapons
when
he
knowingly
carries
or
possesses
in
any
vehicle
or
concealed
on
or
about
his
person
except
when
on
his
land
or
in
his
own
abode
or
fixed
place
of
business
any
pistol
revolver
stun
gun
or
taser
or
other
firearm
note
that
this
doesnt
affect
all
concealed
carry
look
after
the
word
except
it
always
helps
to
read
the
law
before
commenting
on
it
i
did
read
the
law
before
i
commented
on
it
judging
from
replies
i
received
about
my
semantics
on
tpg
post
many
if
not
most
people
here
on
tpg
assume
that
when
ccw
laws
are
asked
about
the
person
is
asking
about
the
possibility
of
an
ordinary
citizen
getting
one
it
would
also
follow
that
said
person
would
get
the
ccw
to
carry
on
hisher
person
away
from
their
home
andor
business
would
a
prudent
storekeeper
carry
concealed
how
about
someone
at
home
note
that
both
are
legal
and
a
lot
of
common
people
qualify
for
one
or
the
other
andy
maybe
freeman
did
prove
his
point
but
his
point
is
not
relevant
the
thing
that
most
people
seem
to
care
about
when
they
ask
questions
about
carrying
a
concealed
weapon
is
whether
or
not
they
can
carry
it
concealed
on
their
person
when
they
are
out
on
the
street
somewhere
im
sure
that
not
many
people
are
concerned
with
whether
or
not
they
can
carry
concealed
at
home
speaking
as
someone
who
lives
in
illinois
the
only
place
where
the
above
quoted
law
is
relevant
i
know
that
it
is
legal
to
own
a
handgun
here
i
am
not
taking
into
account
city
ordinances
i
could
care
less
about
whether
or
not
i
can
carry
concealed
at
home
i
only
care
about
the
fact
that
i
cant
carry
concealed
in
the
place
where
it
really
counts
out
on
the
street
freeman
loves
to
be
accurate
and
i
can
understand
that
especially
not
but
he
seems
to
be
forgetting
that
accurate
facts
dont
always
replace
common
sense
i
am
not
going
to
followup
to
this
thread
anymore
because
i
believe
that
it
is
useless
to
argue
these
points
anymore
the
only
thing
that
is
happening
now
is
that
freeman
and
i
are
running
around
in
circles
trying
to
prove
each
other
wrong
and
i
do
not
have
the
time
to
be
playing
games
anymore
of
course
now
freeman
will
attack
me
about
my
use
of
common
sense
in
some
of
my
earlier
posts
but
what
can
i
do
my
only
advice
for
freeman
quit
being
so
picky
about
accuracy
sometimes
and
use
your
common
sense
it
really
does
work
some

the

in

cites
a
misleading
statistic
that
was
originally
reported
in

new

journal
of
medicine
the
article
states
a
study
found
that
a
gun
in
the

was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
this
is
an
oftenquoted
statistic
and
it
is
misleading
for
sev
eral
reasons
outlined
below
the
study
gives
the
impression
that
if
you
own
a
gun
the
likelihood
that
you
will
successfully
use
it
to
defend
yourself
is
less
than
that
of
the
gun
being
turned
against
you
the
study
however
fails
to
take
into
account
cases
where
a
lawabiding
citizen
uses
a
gun
to
thwart
a
crime
without
actually
killing
the
perpe
trator
the

actually
refers

possibly
an

but
hardly
a

the

is
based
on
the

dis
position
of
cases
and
fails
to
take
into

cases
originally

that
were
later
ruled
to
be

considering
the
small

into

has
a
sub
stantial
effect
on
the
ratio
quoted
criminologist
gary
kleck
gives
us
a
slightly
dif
erent
statistic
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
successfully
by
a
private
citizen
against
an
aggressor
than
it
is
to
kill
anyone
at
all
further
per
sons
defending
themselves
from
aggression
by
using
a

fare
better
than
those
who
resist
vicimization
by
some
other
means
or
who
offer
no
resistance
at
all
statistics
available
from
the
fbi
and
other
agencies
also
show
that
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
by
a
noncriminal
to
defend
against
criminal
threat
than
to
be

commit

homicide
times
more

to

times
more

using

ah
but
we
have
evaluated
gun

using

and
it
doesnt
work
to
reduce
crime
what
is
the
point
we
cant
claim
that
it
is
symbolic
as
people
do
get
jailed
the
police
are
essentially
saying
look
if
you
have
a

lying
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for

we
care
about

no
theyre

we
hope
this
will
keep
you
from

isnt

you

the

there
something

pay

anyone
who
lawfully
protects
their
life
with
a
firearm
sounds
a
bit
tacky
but
hey
whatever
works
as
david
veal
points
out
this
sort
of
promotion
would
be
used
against
gun
owners
by
the
mass
media
however
here
is
my
proposal
offer
gun
safety
classes
in
your
area
free
as
a
community
service
such
a
class
would
normally
cost
or
so
offering
it
free
is
a
good
promotion
our
gun
club
has
organized
several
of
these
we
just
finished
teaching
another
one
last
night
in
fact
and
they
have
been
very
well
received
we
get
a
lot
of
people
who
are
novices
interested
in
guns
we
even
get
a
few
who
are
antigun
but
feel
they
should
know
something
about
gun
safety
since
members
of
their
family
keep
guns
at
home
teaching
such
a
course
gives
us
many
desirable
benefits
we
have
the
chance
to
teach
gun
safety
rules
this
increases
firearm
awareness
and
may
help
to
reduce
gun
accident
stats
a
gun
safety
class
is
politically
correct
and
likely
to
be
viewed
positively
by
the
public
and
the
media
most
of
the
students
are
normal
people
not
gun
enthusiasts
and
this
kind
of
class
gives
us
the
chance
to
give
them
a
gentle
introduction
to
firearms
some
of
the
students
are
enthusiastic
and
will
purchase
a
gun
and
become
more
involved
in
shooting
or
personal
defense
it
improves
the
public
perception
of
our
club
and
gun
owners
in
general
our
students
see
that
we
are
all
reasonable
nonaggressive
softspoken
people
which
helps
to
mitigate
the
standard
image
of
a
hardcore
gun
owner
even
antigun
students
sometimes
tell
us
they
have
something
new
to
think
about
with
regards
to
personal
gun
ownership
sharing
our
experience
with
others
is
a
lot
of
fun
our
course
is
the
standard
nracertified
home
firearm
safety
class
and
our
students
pay
only
for
materials
we
also
teach
the
nras
personal
protection
class
although
the
cost
is
higher
for
that
one
since
we
have
to
purchase
range
time
i
think
firearms
safety
classes
are
an
excellent
response
to
gun
buybacks

just

statements
supported
these
charges
a
local
offense
if
true
totally
outside
the
batfs
domain
was
it
a
noknock
i
really
havent
heard
anything
on
that
but
clearly
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his
own
business
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in
the
world
if
they
dont
bother
anyone
but
he
was
a
scary
sort
dont
you
think
i
didnt
know
the
man
just
what
the
tv
chose
to
tell
me
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
i
thought
there
were
prejudicial
undertones
here
i
would
trust
my
daughters
judgement
i
didnt
think
so
reason
number
one
to
doubt
the
legal
statements
made
by
some
of
the
survivors
note
that
some
of
them
were
made
by
his
guard
wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained
killers
i
dont
believe
either
side
blindly
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some
redwhiteand
blue
american
defending
his
home
against
big
brother
if
they
fired
first
without
announcing
in
a
beleivable
way
who
they
were
i
can
pound
on
your
door
and
claim
to
be
the
police
will
you
just
lay
down
and
take
it
if
i
do
then
he
could
be
justified
in
firing
on
the
atf
in
selfdefense
that
shit
doesnt
fly
anyone
with
his
background
that
will
shoot
and
kill
federal

is
not
some

has
he

the

mostly
what

the

let

not

that

often
an
important
factor
in

seeing
disheveled
persons
on

is
not
likely
to
be
evaluated
equally
with
meeting
a
grimey
sort
as
described

on

street
at

anyone
that
cannot
properly
discriminate
between
these
two
different
situations
is
legitimate
fodder
for
the

survival
of

something

proximity
no
room
to

on

without
getting
real
close

someone
an
inner
sense
now
im
really
getting
nervous
sounds
like
you
doubt
your
own
abilities
you
sound
pretty
typical
in
this
respect
you
also
seem
to
think
that
youll
be
safe
or
safer
if
others
are
unarmed
this
is
dangerous
fantasy
twice
when
i
was
hiking
the
at
i
came
up
on
a
shelter
that
i
was
planning
on
staying
at
and
saw
someone
sitting
there
cleaning
his
gun
softly
i
backed
away
and
hiked
another
miles
to
get
out
of
there
ill
freely
admit
it
here
im
not
afraid
of
guns
im
afraid
of
people
that
bring
them
into
the
backcountry
then
you
are
in
need
of
some
form
of
therapy
not
necessarily
that
of
an
analyst
but
maybe
you
should
learn
about
guns
your
fear
is
seems
to
be
based
in
ignorance
and
false
knowledge
you
see
a
person
with
a
gun
and
you
feel
threatened
why
is
this
so
have
you
any
legitimate
basis
for
this
any
firsthand
experience
that
lends
validity
to
your
fears
or
are
your
fears
based
on
mediated
experience
ie
the
anecdotes
of
others
such
as
network
news
i
trust
you
can
see
the
lack
of
legitimacy
in
such
mediated
inputs
and
why
are
you
afraid
of
the
people
as
mentioned
above
forgive
me
but
you
sound
afraid
to
the
point
of
paranoia
perhaps
you
should
talk
to
someone
about
this
i
am
not
saying
this
to
be
rude
or
fascetious
but
i
think
anyone
with
fear
as
deep
and
baseless
as
yours
seems
to
be
needs
some
sort
of
help
living
in
fear
really
sucks
even
if
it
is
only
when
around
people
with
guns
in
the
back
country
tell
me
would
you
be
as
fearful
of

that

work
cars

should
really
not

i
just
tried
to
make
a
point
like
america
norway
has
some
spaces
you
have
to
cross
to
get
from

so
a
car
is
essential
in
most
parts
guns
on
the
other
hand
are
not
essential
in

so
we
dont
argue
that
if
we
banned
guns
we
have
to
ban
cars

who
believe
that
hitler
and
could
be
avoided

no

has

are
unsealed
seem

taken

come

be

there
have

interviews
with
some

whose

were
in

at

funny
i

any

these
interviews
interesting
that
when
the
social
services
agencies
investigated
koresh
on
these
previous
charges
they
found
absolutely
no
evidence
of
abuse
these
parents
claimed
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
the
childrens
statements
supported
these
charges
funny
i
dont
remember
hearing
anything
about
childrens
statements
either
where
did
you
say
you
heard
all
this
what
i
heard
was
that
none
of
the
children
who
left
the
compound
early
in
the
seige
exhibited
any
signs
typical
of
abuse
physical
or
mental
this
from
the
newspaper
and
national
tv
news
did
you
also
hear
that
its
the
job
of
the
batf
and
the
fbi
to
lay
siege
to
homes
where
child
abuse
is
suspected
i
thought
you
did
was
it

i
really

anything
on

but
clearly
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his

clearly
please
tell
us
what
koresh
was
doing
that
can
be
construed
as
other
than
minding
his

before
the

raided
the
place
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in

if
they
dont

anyone

he
was
a

dont

not

youd

what

do
you
suppose
the

little

note
that
some

were

by

wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained

and
next
i
suppose
youll
tell
us
exactly
who
these
welltrained
killers
have
killed
then
he
fired
on
the

thats
not
just
a

claims

in

be

their

heartily
supported

wondered

who
helped
put

and
jack

who
recently
came
out
in

these
are
conservatives

kind
of
suicide
pact
or
counterassault
efforts
its
ultimately
irrelevant
who
lit
the
fire
they
had
ample
opportunity
to
leave
same
for
the
jews
in
europe
while
he
was
there
anyway
outsiders
rarely
see
abuse
its
a
secretive
thing
all
we
have
to
go
on
are
the
court
documents
in
the
jewell
case
and
the
mistrial
in
california
you
dont
see
any
evidence
of
the
abuse
therefore
it
must
be
taking
place
as
you
point
out
everwhere
but
here
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
the
atf
is
not
in
charge
of
investigating
child
abuse
no
one
was
ever
held
against
their
wills
and
could
have
left
at
any
time
the
people
who
were
murdered
in
the
fire
were
there
by
their
own
choices
exactly
by
their
own
choice
in
obvious
contradiction
to
the
statements
made
by
the
f
b
i
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
and
just
what
are
those
actions
that
you
are
judging
them
by
their
refusal
to
let
the
government
control
their
lives
their
refusal
to
submit
to
unconstitutional
laws
their
refusal
to
behave
like
cowards
some
of
texas
heros
could
have
taken
the
cowardly
way
out
too
and
surrendered
the
alamo
after
all
all
they
had
to
do
was
come
out
they
stayed
as
you
say
by
their
own
choice
problem
is
not
everyone
chooses
to
act
like
a
groveling
dog
in
the
face
of
insurmountable
odds
but
as
you
point
out
they
certainly
do
have
that
right
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
bull
they
did
in
fact
live
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
the
warrant
was
not
issued
because
they
stockpiled
weapons
it
is
not
against
the
law
to
own
as
many
guns
as
you
want
yet
except
in
virginiathe
warrant
was
issued
for
some
gun
parts
that
are
about
the
size
of
a
halfdollar
certainly
worth

many
people
dont

think
just
as
we
dont

a
cop
who
shoots
a
kid
who

pointed
a
toy

at

i

remember

tom
i
hope
youll
respond
and
i
seem
to
be
a
voice
of
reason
or
some
such
ive
been
recieving
fan
mail
so
naturally
my
ego
is
somehwat
inflated
of
late
and
hope
to
make
a
few
points
here
i
have
never
spoken
for
a
ban
against
guns
in
america
what
ive
said
is
that
there
seems
to
be
to
many
of
them
and
especially
to
many
in
wrong
hands
and
our
argument
is
that
you
cannot
remove
them
from
the
people
who
need
restricting
and
not
remove
them
from
the
people
who
dont
a
fairly
simple
problem
given
our
size
and
numbers
do
you
agree
we
all
believe
criminals
particularly
violent
criminals
should
not
have
firearms
the
problem
is
making
a
law
that
does
this
without
trodding
upon
the
rights
of
the
vast
majority
nobody
here
seems
to
be
able
to
do
it
and
i
doubt
anybody
in
norway
can
either
thus
we
are
left
with
a
philosophical
difference
does
the
safety
of
a
few
justify
restricting
the
many
we
say
no
while
others
say
yes
now
if
you
would
like
to
reduce
the
number
how
would
you
do
it
without
affecting
goodresponcible
gun
owners
can
you
provide
a
method
that
cannot
be
abused
i
doubt
it
i
do
believe
in
a
persons
freedom
what
i
dont
believe
is
that
you
can
have
it
all
and
dont
pay
for
it
of
course
this
is
not
in
contention
what
is
in
contention
is
how
much
one
has
to
pay
most
europeans
believe
in
a
society
of
individuals
and
that
you
have
to
give
a
little
to
make
that
society
work
it
is
this
giving
a
little
that
makes
americans
wary
we
have
seen
this
argument
before
you
might
remember
how
a
chamberlain
gave
a
little
to
a
particular
fascistshort
asshole
and
how
such
appeasement
worked
while
it
might
work
in
some
instances
it
doesnt
work
in
others
and
since
we
cannot
predict
the
future
we
must
be
cautious
in
using
actions
that
have
a
history
of
failure
cars
and
guns
should
really
not
be
mixed
i
just
tried
to
make
a
point
like
america
norway
has
some
spaces
you
have
to
cross
to
get
from
a
to
b
so
a
car
is
essential
in
most
parts
guns
on
the
other
hand
are
not
essential
in
norway
so
we
dont
argue
that
if
we
banned
guns
we
have
to
ban
cars
cars
are
not
essential
in
norway
any
more
than
they
are
in
the
usa
im
willing
to
bet
that
you
have
neighbors
that
would
be
willing
to
drive
you
anywhere
you
wanted
to
go
for
a
price
thus
cars
are
not
essential
for
your
transportation
however
the
arguments
presented
show
that
since
cars
are
used
to
kill
far
more
people
than
guns
in
the
usa
it
makes
much
more
sense
to
restrict
cars
than
it
does
guns
how
one
defines
essential
often
depends
upon
what
one
is
willing
to
go
through
for
that
service
when
we
look
at
the
raw
data
such
comparisons
are
not
individually
weighed
everyone
who
believe
that
hitler
and
could
be
avoided
if
there
were
more
guns
in
germany
in
the
please
read
some
history
this
depends
upon
what
the
populace
was
willing
to
do
as
desert
storm
proved
even
an
armed
populace
wont
just
revolt
even
when
given
a
chance
still
would
hitler
have
done
all
that
he
did
with
an
armed
populace
we
have
to
wonder
as
some
of
his
first
acts
were
to
confiscate
firearms
other
points
in
history
show
that
dictators
were
overthrown
by
arms
in
the
hands
of
the
populace
thus
were
left
wondering
if
hitler
would
have
been
overthrown
or
if
king
george
was
just
unlucky
in
keeping
the
usa
as
a
colony
one
can
argue
both
sides
one
also
has
to
live
with
each
action
is
this
discussion
about
banning
weapons
for
all
americans
or
making
it
harder
for
criminals
to
get
one
it
is
about
but
so
far
all
proposals
to
curtail
have
wound
up
enforcing
as
well
i
only
wish
that
or
was
so
logical
change
of
name
that
was
on
my
part
purely
in
jest
i
merely
pointed
out
how
we
were
from
similar
backgrounds
racially
but
of
wholly
different
backgrounds
politically
i
thought
this
would
underscore
my
point
on
how
our
cultures
were
so
different
despite
similar
heritage
did
the
batf
get
the
warrant
for
a
gun
search
only
or
was
there
other
reasons
child
abuse
for
instance
batf
can
only
enforce
guntobacccoalcohol
violations
child
abuse
is
a
matter
for
the
individual
states
and
local
authorities
doesnt
the
people
reading
this
newsgroup
have
access
to
the

hierarcy
some

nathan
engle
what
did
those
people
do
wrong
in
the
first
place
that
is
what
i
cant
figure
out
they
assembled
a
frightening
arsenal
of
weapons
by
circumventing
laws
which
were
intended
to
prevent
such
a
buildup
then
later
they
used
some
of
those
weapons
to
kill
representatives
of
the
federal
government
im
sure
they
were
frightened
when
they
saw
all
those
batf
officers
closing
in
but
in
retrospect
i
cant
see
how
their
subsequent
gunfight
could
be
expected
to
improve
the
situation
what
laws
did
they
circumvent
being
frightening
isnt
a
crime
some
people
are
afraid
of
young
black
males
that
doesnt
make
the
mere
status
of
being
a
young
black
male
a
crime
the
batf
itself
admitted
leading
off
by
throwing
handgrenades
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
properly
identified
themselves
as
law
enforcement
personnel
under
those
circumstances
other
persons
have
been
found
to
be
acting
within
their
legal
rights
to
exercise
self
defense
against
unidentified
armed
intruders
at
this
point
i
place
little
or
no
credibility
on
any
of
the
charges
of
child
abuse
or
molestation
but
i
would
remind
you
that
the
branch
davidians
arent
the
only
ones
burying
their
dead
the
charges
are
irrlevant
anyway
since
the
batf
has
absolutely
no
jurisdiction
in
such
matters
anyway
of
course
that
hasnt
stopped
them
from
making
other
such
spurious
charges
such
as
the
existence
of
mythical
meth
labs
of
course
they
whole
cult
thing
indicates
the
level
of
contempt
that
they
have

sure
they
were
crazy
no
dought
about
it
but
what
did
they
do
wrong
they
attempted
to
stage
an
armed
resistance
to
federal

under
conditions
that
placed
dozens

of

with
approximately
this
is
from

votes

and
votes
against
what
does
this

do
however
in
an
effort
to
go
into
cya
thats
cover
your
ass
mode
they
wrote
the
bill
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
law
subject
to
a
statewide
referendum
in
november
however
the
paper
reported
that
this
is
actually
unconstitutional
under
the
texas
constitution
which
only
allows
referendums
for
constitutional
amendments
not
for
plain
old
laws
if
the
court
does
not
permit
the
referendum
the
bill
will
probably
go
into
effect
with
little
fanfare
all

problem
with
smuggled
guns
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
someone
said
that
if
we
ban
guns
wed
have
to
ban
cars
to
because
they
kill
to
i
dont
think
we
should
argue
on
this
one
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
dont
flame
the
englishmen
because
of
northern
irland
they
have
gun
control
that
works
in
england
and
fonds
from
usa
are
one
of
the
reasons
why
ira
can
bomb
innocents
something
about
throwing
stones
in
glass
houses
dont
flame
them
because
of
what
to
three
children
did
either
can
an
jugoslav
have
an
oppinion
on
guns
or
even
peace
yes
my
numbers
about

after

in

cars
falls

drowning

at

for
sorry
charlesaccording
to
the
national

council
accident
in
gun
accidents
were
the
fifthleading
cause
of
accidental
death
for
children

and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
the
difference
is
that
a
rational
person
would
address
the
leading
cause
first
and
address
the
lesser
causes
later
that
thinking
is
so
screwed
up
i

a
rational

would
concentrate
on
motor
vehicle
deaths
and
not
attempt

falls
drownings
gunshot

etc
so
this
so
called
rational
person
using
your
definition
if
he

she
were
attempting
to
affect
the
leading
causes
of
deaths
for

chronic

oh

charles

i
tell

hotlines
and
tell

that
they
are
not
acting
rational
and
that
they
can
all
go
home
because
they
are
addressing
the
lesser

death
and
you
call
your
local

homicide
department
liver

foundation
and
tell
them
to
stop
addressing
these
lesser

please
quit
wasting

silly

charles
ive
got
an

charles
why
dont
you
start

group
this
is
talkpoliticsguns
dont
confuse
the
issue
just
because
a
social
problem
may
not
claim
as
many
victims
as
another
we
should
not
try
to
address
it
i
dont
agree
im
not
posting
to
tpg
to
debate
the
supposed
severity
of
causes
of
childhood
deaths
i
am
really
getting
frigging
sick
of
having
to
respond
to
the
irrational
statements
of
people
who
assume
that
someone
who
wants
to
discuss
youth
gun
violence
or
unintentional
youth
gun
deaths
is
trying
to
make
a
political
issue
out
of
it
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
a
humane
person
who
keeps
a
firearm
in
the
house
with
a
year
old
would
also
teach
this
child
how
to
safely
handle
the
firearm
ignorance
is
our
greatest
enemy
again
charles
you
tend
to
confuse
the
issue
and
take
things
out
of
context
for
your
own
purposes
the
statement
that
you
responded
to
above
is
actually
in
reference
to
a
previous
post
by
another
person
who
like
you
expressed
concern
over
making
youth
gun
violence
a
priority
i
guess
maybe
humane
person
and
rational
person
could
be
interchangeable
huh
both
would
be
defined
as
a
person
who
only
addresses
the
social
problem
that
causes
the
greatest
number
of
childhood
deaths
if
that
is
the
case
im
extremely
glad
that
i
am
inhumane
and
irrational
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
what
other
sources
of
information
do
you
have
which
confirms
their
data
these
folks
are
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
perhaps
you
can
verify
their
data
with
the
uniform
crime
report
sorry
charles
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
is
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
but
if
you
insist
according
to
the
ucr
firearm
murders
of
youngsters
and
under
increased
percent
between
and
is
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
good
enough
for
you
they
state
that
every
day
american
children
ages
and
under
are
killed
in
gun
accidents
suicides
and
homicides
many
more
are
wounded
or
how
about
the
national
pediatric
trauma
registry
they
say
gunshot
wounds
to
children
ages
and
under
nearly
doubled
in
major
urban
areas
between
and
do
you
also
doubt
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
charles
they
state
that
gunshot
wounds
among
children
in
urban
areas
increased
from
to
charles
i
hope
you
dont
need
to
be
convinced
that
youth
are
increasingly
victims
of
gun
injuries
and
that
they
have
easy
access
to
guns
if
you
dont
realize
this
fact
i
dont
care
if
you
go
by
cdc
or
fbi
data
or
if
you
go
into
the
homes
schools
and
streets
where
these
kids
are
and
take
a
poll
by
yourself
im
not
going
to
bother
to
try
to
convince
you
its
obvious
that
you
have
ruled
out
any
idea
of
discussing
this
issue
in
a
sane
fashion
and
that
you
are
so
focused
on
trying
to
make
this
a
gun
control
and
political
discussion
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
they
have
firearm
statistics
are
firearms
a
disease
charles
its
obvious
that
you
know
nothing
about
the
cdc
they
dont
just
study
cancer
and
heart
disease
ive
got
news
for
you
interpersonal
gun
violence
is
an
epidemic
in
surgeon
general
c
everett
koop
declared
that
gun
violence
is
as
much
a
public
health
problem
as
cancer
heart
disease
or
auto
accidents
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
in
the
lives
of
youths
or
in
their
schools
i
know
a
number
of
youths
who
have
firearms
present
in
their
lives
is
is
quite
appropriate
to
teach
children
to
safely
handle
firearms
this
is
a
presence
right
what
are
you
trying
to
say
this
innuendo
reminds
me

listening

the

said
anything

read

you
decide

are
you
saying
here
youre
wasting

the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
i
wouldnt
trust
their
statistics
without
independent
verification
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
based
on
cphv
statistics
based
on
ucr
based

the

also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty

have
access

in

what
is
the
purpose

this
claim
charles
buddy
im
getting
really
tired
of
this
do
you
live

mars
as
a
physicist
i
realize
that
you
probably
dont
come
into
contact
with
many
youth
but
i
really
think
you
need
to
make
a
trip
to
your
local
urban
high
school
and
discover
the
joy
of
guns
in
schools
in
addition
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
to
these
kids
ask
them
if
they
have
ever
heard
gunshots
in
their
neighborhoods
whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
been
shot
whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
a

whether
they
have

held
a

and
whether

themselves
have
ever
been
shot
believe
