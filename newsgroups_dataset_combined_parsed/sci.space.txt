i

i
agree
you
can
add
dark

and
quarks
and
a
lot
of
other
unobservable
purely
theoretical
constructs
in

to
that
list
including
the
omnipresent
black
holes
will
bruce
argue
that
their
existence
can
be
inferred
from
theory
alone
then
what
about
my
original
criticism
when
i
said
curvature
can
only
exist
relative
to
something
noncurved
bruce
replied
existence
is
undefined
unless
it
is
synonymous
with
observable
in
physics
we
cannot
observe
more
than
the
four
dimensions
we
know
about
at
the
moment
i
dont
see
a
way
to
defend
that
statement
and
the
existence
of
these
unobservable
phenomena
simultaneously
tom
i
hold
that
space
cannot
be
curved
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
can
have
no
properties
of
properties
we
can
only
speak
when
dealing
with
matter
filling
the
space
to
say
that
in
the
presence
of
large
bodies
space
becomes
curved
is
equivalent
to
stating
that
something
can
act
upon
nothing
i
for
one
refuse
to
subscribe

such

view

these

thats
what

belief
to
the
contrary
the
saturn
v
blueprints
have
not
been
lost
they
are
kept
at
marshall
space
flight
center
on

the
problem
in
recreating
the
saturn
v
is
not
finding
the

it
is
finding
vendors
who
can
supply
vintage
hardware
like
guidance
system
components
and
the
fact
that
the

you
have

the
effort
was
to
look

shuttle

the
shuttle
source
assumes
space
shuttles
and
titan
rockets
are
launched
yearly
thus
the
launches
would
add
less
than
to
the
total
stratospheric
chlorine
sources
the

on

is
minimal
global

average
total

would
be
decreased
by
this
is
much
less
than

variability
associated
with
volcanic
activity
and
solar

the
influence
of
humanmade
chlorine
products
on
ozone
is
computed
by
atmospheric

calculations
to
be
a
decrease
in
globally
averaged
ozone
between
and
the
influence
of
the
space
shuttle
and
titan
rockets
on
the
stratosphere
is
negligible
the
launch
schedule
of
the
space
shuttle
and

would
need
to
be
increased
by
over
a
factor
of
a
hundred

how
the
challenger
astronauts
died
the
challenger
shuttle
launch
was
not
destroyed
in
an
explosion
this
is
a
welldocumented
fact
see
the
rogers
commission
report
for
example
what
looked
like
an
explosion
was
fuel
burning
after
the
external
tank
came
apart
the
forces
on
the
crew
cabin
were
not
sufficient
to
kill
the
astronauts
never
mind
destroy
their
bodies
according
to
the
kerwin
teams
medicalforensic
report
the
astronauts
were
killed
when
the
moreorless
intact
cabin
hit
the
water
at
circa
and
their
bodies
then
spent
several
weeks
underwater
their
remains
were

and
after
the
kerwin
team
examined
them
they
were

buried
using
the
shuttle
beyond
low
earth
orbit
you
cant
use
the
shuttle
orbiter
for
missions
beyond
low
earth
orbit
because
it
cant
get
there
it
is
big
and
heavy
and
does
not
carry
enough
fuel
even
if
you
fill
part
of
the
cargo
bay
with
tanks
furthermore
it
is
not
particularly
sensible
to
do
so
because
much
of
that
weight
is
things
like
wings
which
are
totally
useless
except
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
earth
the
shuttle
orbiter
is
highly
specialized
for
travel
between
earths
surface
and
low
orbit
taking
it
higher
is
enormously
costly
and
wasteful
a
much
better
approach
would
be
to
use
shuttle
subsystems
to
build
a
specialized
highorbit
spacecraft
yet
another
concise
answer
by
henry
spencer
the
face
on
mars
there
really
is
a
big
rock
on
mars
that
looks
remarkably
like
a
humanoid
face
it
appears
in
two
different
frames
of
viking
orbiter
imagery
much
more
facelike
in
appearance
and
the
one
more
often
published
with
the
sun
degrees
above
western
horizon
and
with
the
sun
degrees
from
the
west
science
writer
richard
hoagland
has
championed
the
idea
that
the
face
is
artificial
intended
to
resemble
a
human
and
erected
by
an
extraterrestrial
civilization
most
other
analysts
concede
that
the
resemblance
is
most
likely
accidental
other
viking
images
show
a
smileyfaced
crater
and
a
lava
flow
resembling
kermit
the
frog
elsewhere
on
mars
there

a

anomalies
research
society
sorry
dont
know
the
address
to

the

the
mars
observer
mission
will
carry
an
extremely

camera
and
better
images
of
the
formation
will
hopefully
settle
this
question
in

then
an

announcement
q
how
do
i
become
an
astronaut
a
we
will
assume
you
mean
a
nasa
astronaut
since
its
probably
impossible
for
a
nonrussian
to
get
into
the
cosmonaut
corps
paying
passengers
are
not
professional
cosmonauts
and
the
other
nations
have
so
few
astronauts
and
fly
even
fewer
that
youre
better
off
hoping
to
win
a
lottery
becoming
a
shuttle
pilot
requires
lots
of
fastjet
experience
which
means
a
military
flying
career
forget
that
unless
you
want
to
do
it
anyway
so
you
want
to
become
a
shuttle
mission
specialist
if
you
arent
a
us
citizen
become
one
that
is
a
must
after
that
the
crucial
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
demand
for
such
jobs
vastly
exceeds
the
supply
nasas
problem
is
not
finding
qualified
people
but
thinning
the
lineup
down
to
manageable
length
it
is
not
enough
to
be
qualified
you
must
avoid
being
disqualified
for
any
reason
many
of
them
in
principle
quite
irrelevant
to
the
job
get
a
phd
specialize
in
something
that
involves
getting
your
hands
dirty
with
equipment
not
just
paper
and
pencil
forget
computer

entirely
it
will
be
done
from
the
ground
for
the
fore
seeable
future
degrees
in
one
field
plus
work
experience
in
another
seems
to
be
a
frequent
winner
be
in
good
physical
condition
with
good
eyesight
do
not
get
a
radial
keratomy
or
similar
hack
to
improve
your
vision
nobody
knows
what
sudden
pressure
changes
would
do
to
rked
eyes
and
longterm
effects
are
poorly
understood
for
that
matter
avoid
any
other
significant
medical
unknowns
if
you
can
pass
a

physical
you
should
be
okay
if
you
cant
your
chances
are
poor
practise
public
speaking
and
be
conservative
and
conformist
in
appearance
and
actions
youve
got
a
tough
selling
job
ahead
trying
to
convince
a
cautious
conservative
selection
committee
that
you
are
better
than
hundreds
of
other
applicants
and
also
that
you
will
be
a
credit
to
nasa
after
you
are
hired
public
relations
is
a
significant
part
of
the
job
and
nasas
image
is
very
prim
and
proper
the
image
you
want
is
squeakyclean
workaholic
yuppie
remember
also
that
you
will
need
a
security
clearance
at
some
point
and
security
considers
everybody
guilty
until
proven
innocent
keep
your

clean
get

overview
you
may
be
reading
this
document
on
any
one
of
an
amazing
variety
of
computers
so
much
of
the
material
below
may
not
apply
to
you
in
general
however
systems
connected
to
the
net
fall
in
one
of
three
categories
internet
usenet
or
bitnet
electronic
mail
may
be
sent
between
these
networks
and
other
resources
available
on
one
of
these
networks
are
sometimes
accessible
from
other
networks
by
email
sent
to
special
servers
the
space
and
astronomy
discussion
groups
actually
are
composed
of
several
mechanisms
with
mostly
transparent
connections
between
them
one
mechanism
is
the
mailing
list
in
which
mail
is
sent
to
a
central
distribution
point
which
relays
it
to
all
recipients
of
the
list
in
addition
to
the
general
lists
for
space
called
space
digest
for
internet
users
and
space
on
bitnet
there
are
a
number
of
more
specialized
mailing
lists
described
below
a
second
mechanism
is
usenet
netnews
this
is
somewhat
like
a
bulletin
board
operating
on
each
system
which
is
a
part
of
the
net
netnews
separates
contributions
into
hundreds
of
different
categories
based
on
a
group
name
the
groups
dealing
most
closely
with
space
topics
are
called
scispacenews
scispace
scispaceshuttle
sciastro
and
talkpoliticsspace
contributors
post
submissions
called
articles
in
netnews
terminology
on
their
local
machine
which
sends
it
to
other
nearby
machines
similarly
articles
sent
from
nearby
machines
are
stored
locally
and
may
be
forwarded
to
other
systems
so
that
an
article
is
posted
locally
and
eventually
reaches
all
the
usenet
sites
interested
in
receiving
the
news
group
to
which
the
article
was
posted
gateway
machines
redirect
the
usenet
scispace
group
into
internet
and
bitnet
mailing
lists
and
vice
versa
the
other
usenet
groups
are
not
accessible
as
mailing
lists
if
you
can
receive
netnews
its
more
flexible
interface
and
access
to
a
wider
range
of
material
usually
make
it
the
preferred
option

why
does
the
shuttle
roll
just
after
liftoff
the
following
answer
and
translation
are
provided
by
ken
jenks
kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov
the
ascent
guidance
and
flight
control
training
manual
asc
gc
says
during
the
vertical
rise
phase
the
launch
pad
attitude
is
commanded
until
an
iloaded
vrel
sufficient
to
assure
launch
tower
clearance
is
achieved
then
the
tilt
maneuver
roll
program
orients
the
vehicle
to
a
heads
down
attitude
required
to
generate
a
negative
qalpha
which
in
turn
alleviates
structural
loading
other
advantages
with
this
attitude
are
performance
gain
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
improved
sband
look
angles
and
crew
view
of
the
horizon
the
tilt
maneuver
is
also
required
to
start
gaining
downrange
velocity
to
achieve
the
main
engine
cutoff
meco
target
in
second
stage
this
really
is
a
good
answer
but
its
couched
in
nasa
jargon
ill
try
to
interpret
we
wait
until
the
shuttle
clears
the
tower
before
rolling
then
we
roll
the
shuttle
around
so
that
the
angle
of
attack
between
the
wind
caused
by
passage
through
the
atmosphere
the
relative
wind
and
the
chord
of
the
wings
the
imaginary
line
between
the
leading
edge
and
the
trailing
edge
is
a
slightly
negative
angle
a
negative
qalpha
this
causes
a
little
bit
of
downward
force
toward
the
belly
of
the
orbiter
or
the
z
direction
and
this
force
alleviates
structural
loading
we
have
to
be
careful
about
those
wings
theyre
about
the
most
delicate
part
of
the
vehicle
the
new
attitude
after
the
roll
also
allows
us
to
carry
more
mass
to
orbit
or
to
achieve
a
higher
orbit
with
the
same
mass
or
to
change
the
orbit
to
a
higher
or
lower
inclination
than
would
be
the
case
if
we
didnt
roll
performance
gain
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
fly
a
less
complicated
flight
path
if
they
had
to
execute
one
of
the
more
dangerous
abort
maneuvers
the
return
to
launch
site
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
the
new
attitude
improves
the
ability
for
groundbased
radio
antennae
to
have
a
good
lineofsight
signal
with
the
sband
radio
antennae
on
the
orbiter
improved
sband
look
angles
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
see
the
horizon
which
is
a
helpful
but
not
mandatory
part
of
piloting
any
flying
machine
the
new
attitude
orients
the
shuttle
so
that
the
body
is
more
nearly
parallel
with
the
ground
and
the
nose
to
the
east
usually
this
allows
the
thrust
from
the
engines
to
add
velocity
in
the
correct
direction
to
eventually
achieve
orbit
remember
velocity
is
a
vector
quantity
made
of
both
speed
and
direction
the
shuttle
has
to
have
a
large
horizontal
component
to
its
velocity
and
a
very
small
vertical
component
to
attain
orbit
this
all
begs
the
question
why
isnt
the
launch
pad
oriented
to
give
this
nice
attitude
to
begin
with
why
does
the
shuttle
need
to
roll
to
achieve
that
attitude
the
answer
is
that
the
pads
were
leftovers
from
the
apollo
days
the
shuttle
straddles
two
flame
trenches
one
for
the
solid
rocket
motor
exhaust
one
for
the
space
shuttle
main
engine
exhaust
you
can
see
the
effects
of
this
on
any
daytime
launch
the
srm
exhaust
is
dirty
gray
garbage
and
the
ssme
exhaust
is
fluffy
white
steam
watch
for
the
difference
between
the
top
orbiter
side
and
the
bottom
external
tank
side
of
the
stack
the
access
tower
and
other
support
and
service
structure
are
all
oriented
basically
the
same
way
they
were
for
the
saturn
vs
a
side
note
the
saturn
vs
also
had
a
roll
program
dont
ask
me
why
im
a
shuttle
guy
i
checked
with
a
buddy
in
ascent
dynamics
he
added
that
the
roll
maneuver
is
really
a
maneuver
in
all
three
axes
roll
pitch
and
yaw
the
roll
component
of
that
maneuver
is
performed
for
the
reasons
stated
the
pitch
component
controls
loading
on
the
wings
by
keeping
the
angle
of
attack
qalpha
within
a
tight
tolerance
the
yaw
component
is
used
to
determine
the
orbital
inclination
the
total
maneuver
is
really
expressed
as
a
quaternion

the
first
us
attempt
to
send
a
spacecraft
to
venus
failed
minutes
after
launch
in
the
guidance
instructions
from
the
ground
stopped
reaching
the
rocket
due
to
a
problem
with
its
antenna
so
the
onboard
computer
took
control
however
there
turned
out
to
be
a
bug
in
the
guidance
software
and
the
rocket
promptly
went
off
course
so
the
range
safety
officer
destroyed
it
although
the
bug
is
sometimes
claimed
to
have
been
an
incorrect
fortran

statement
it
was
actually
a
transcription

in
which
the
bar
indicating
smoothing
was
omitted
from
the
expression

sub
n
nth

this
error
led
the

to
treat

leading
to
incorrect
compensation
mariner
became
the
first
successful
probe
to
flyby
venus
in

as
the
craft
was
placed
into

unable

energy
for

from

the

soon
died
when

batteries
ran
out
and
is
now
in

it
was
intended
for
a
mars
flyby

mariner
the

did
reach
mars
in
and
took
the
first
closeup
images
of
the
martian
surface
in
all
as
it
flew
by
the
planet
the
probe
found
a
cratered
world
with
an
atmosphere
much
thinner
than
previously
thought
many
scientists
concluded
from
this
preliminary
scan
that
mars
was
a
dead
world
in
both
the
geological
and
biological
sense
mariner
was
sent
to
venus
in
it
reconfirmed
the
data
on
that
planet
collected
five
years
earlier
by
mariner
plus
the
information
that
venus
atmospheric
pressure
at
its
surface
is
at
least
times
that
of
earths
or
the
equivalent
of
being
feet
under
the
surface
of
an
ocean
mariner
and
were
sent
to
mars
in
and
expanded
upon
the
work
done
by
mariner
four
years
earlier
however
they
failed
to
take
away
the
concept
of
mars
as
a
dead
planet
first
made
from
the
basic
measurements
of
mariner
mariner
ended
up
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
when
the
rocket
launcher
autopilot
failed
mariner
the
sister
probe
to
mariner
became
the
first
craft
to
orbit
mars
in
it
returned
information
on
the
red
planet
that
no
other
probe
had
done
before
revealing
huge
volcanoes
on
the
martian
surface
as
well
as
giant
canyon
systems
and
evidence
that

once
flowed
across
the

atmosphere
in

unseen
details
in

plus
the
fact

various
sites
being
studied
as

areas
for
the
manned
apollo
missions
of
the

also
contributed
greatly
to
our
understanding
of
lunar
surface
features
particularly
the
lunar
farside
all
five
probes
of
the
series
launched
from
to
were
essentially
successful
in
their
missions
they
were
the
first
us
probes
to
orbit
the
moon
all
los
were
eventually
crashed
into
the
lunar
surface
to
avoid
interference
with
the
manned
apollo
missions
surveyor
lunar
soft
landers
the
surveyor
series
were
designed
primarily
to
see
if
an
apollo
lunar
module
could
land
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
without
sinking
into
the
soil
before
this
time
it
was
feared
by
some
that
the
moon
was
covered
in
great
layers
of
dust
which
would
not
support
a
heavy
landing
vehicle
surveyor
was
successful
in
proving
that
the
lunar
surface
was
strong
enough
to
hold
up
a
spacecraft
from
to
only
surveyor
and
were
unsuccessful
missions
the
rest
became
the
first
us
probes
to
soft
land
on
the
moon
taking
thousands
of
images
and
scooping
the
soil
for
analysis
apollo
landed
feet
from
surveyor
in
and
returned
parts
of
the
craft
to
earth
surveyor
the
last
of
the
series
was
a
purely
scientific
mission
which
explored
the
tycho
crater
region
in
viking
mars
orbiters
and
landers
viking
was
launched
from
cape
canaveral
florida
on
august
on
a
titan
rocket
the
probe
went
into
martian
orbit
on
june
and
the
lander
set
down
on
the
western
slopes
of
chryse
planitia
on
july
it
soon
began
its
programmed
search
for
martian
microorganisms
there
is
still
debate
as
to
whether
the
probes
found
life
there
or
not
and
sent
back
incredible
color
panoramas
of
its
surroundings
one
thing
scientists
learned
was
that
mars
sky
was
pinkish
in
color
not
dark
blue
as
they
originally
thought
the
sky
is
pink
due
to
sunlight
reflecting
off
the
reddish
dust
particles
in
the
thin
atmosphere
the
lander
set
down
among
a
field
of
red
sand
and
boulders
stretching
out
as
far
as
its
cameras
could
image
the
viking
orbiter
kept
functioning
until
august
when
it
ran
out
of
attitudecontrol
propellant
the
lander
was
switched
into
a
weatherreporting
mode
where
it
had
been
hoped
it
would
keep
functioning
through
but
after
november
an
errant
command
had
been
sent
to
the
lander
accidentally
telling
it
to
shut
down
until
further
orders
communication
was
never
regained
again
despite
the
engineers
efforts
through
may
of
an
interesting
side
note
viking
lander
has
been
designated
the
thomas
a
mutch
memorial
station
in
honor
of
the
late
leader
of
the
lander
imaging
team
the
national
air
and

museum
in
washington
dc
is
entrusted
with
the
safekeeping
of
the
mutch
station
plaque
until
it
can
be
attached
to
the
lander
by
a
manned
expedition
viking
was
launched
on
september
and
arrived
in
martian
orbit
on
august
the
lander
touched
down
on
september
in
utopia
planitia
it
accomplished
essentially
the
same
tasks
as
its
sister
lander
with
the
exception
that
its
seisometer
worked
recording
one
marsquake
the
orbiter
had
a
series
of
attitudecontrol
gas
leaks
in
which
prompted
it
being
shut
down
that
july
the
lander
was
shut
down
on
april
the
orbits
of
both
viking
orbiters
should
decay
around
voyager
outer

flybys
voyager
was
launched
september
and
flew
past
jupiter
on
march
and
by

on
november
voyager
was
launched
august
before
voyager
and
flew
by
jupiter
on
august
by
saturn
on
august
by
uranus
on
january
and
by
neptune
on
august
voyager
took
advantage
of
a
rare
alignment
to
slingshot
its
way
from
outer
planet
to
outer
planet
voyager
could
in
principle
have
headed
towards
pluto
but
jpl
opted
for
the
sure
thing
of
a
titan
close
up
between
the
two
probes
our
knowledge
of
the
giant
planets
their
satellites
and
their
rings
has
become
immense
voyager
discovered
that
jupiter
has
complicated
atmospheric
dynamics
lightning
and
aurorae
three
new
satellites
were
discovered
two
of
the
major
surprises
were
that
jupiter
has
rings
and
that
io
has
active
sulfurous
volcanoes
with
major
effects
on
the
jovian
magnetosphere
when
the
two
probes
reached
saturn
they
discovered
over
ringlets
and
satellites
including
the
predicted
shepherd
satellites
that
keep
the
rings
stable
the
weather
was
tame
compared
with
jupiter
massive
jet
streams
with
minimal
variance
a
great
white
spotband
cycle
is
known
titans
atmosphere
was
smoggy
mimas
appearance
was
startling
one
massive
impact
crater
gave
it
the
death
star
appearance
the
big
surprise
here
was
the
stranger
aspects
of
the
rings
braids
kinks
and
spokes
were
both
unexpected
and
difficult
to
explain
voyager
thanks
to
heroic
engineering
and
programming
efforts
continued
the
mission
to
uranus
and
neptune
uranus
itself
was
highly
monochromatic
in
appearance
one
oddity
was
that
its
magnetic
axis
was
found
to
be
highly
skewed
from
the
already
completely
skewed
rotational
axis
giving
uranus
a
peculiar
magnetosphere
icy
channels
were
found
on
ariel
and
miranda
was
a
bizarre
patchwork
of
different
terrains
satellites
and
one
more
ring
were
discovered
in
contrast
to
uranus
neptune
was
found
to
have
rather
active
weather
including
numerous
cloud
features
the
ring
arcs
turned
out
to
be
bright
patches
on
one
ring
two
other
rings
and
other
satellites
were
discovered
neptunes
magnetic
axis
was
also
skewed
triton
had
a
canteloupe
appearance
and
geysers
whats
liquid
at
the
two
voyagers
are
expected
to
last
for
about
two
more
decades
their
ontarget
journeying
gives
negative
evidence
about
possible
planets
beyond
pluto
their
next
major
scientific
discovery
should
be
the
location
of
the
heliopause

cassini
saturn
orbiter
and

probe
cassini
is
a
joint
nasaesa
project
designed
to
accomplish
an
exploration
of
the
saturnian
system
with
its
cassini
saturn
orbiter
and
huygens
titan
probe
cassini
is
scheduled
for
launch
aboard
a
titan
ivcentaur
in
october
of
after
gravity
assists
of
venus
earth
and
jupiter
in
a
vvejga
trajectory
the
spacecraft
will
arrive
at
saturn
in
june
of
upon
arrival
the
cassini
spacecraft
performs
several
maneuvers
to
achieve
an
orbit
around
saturn
near
the
end
of
this
initial
orbit
the
huygens
probe
separates
from
the
orbiter
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
of
titan
the
orbiter
relays
the
probe
data
to
earth
for
about
hours
while
the
probe
enters
and
traverses
the
cloudy
atmosphere
to
the
surface
after
the
completion
of
the
probe
mission
the
orbiter
continues
touring
the
saturnian
system
for
three
and
a
half
years
titan
synchronous
orbit
trajectories
will
allow
about
flybys
of
titan
and
targeted
flybys
of
iapetus
dione
and
enceladus
the
objectives
of
the
mission
are
threefold
conduct
detailed
studies
of
saturns
atmosphere
rings
and
magnetosphere
conduct
closeup
studies
of
saturns
satellites
and
characterize
titans
atmosphere
and
surface
one
of
the
most
intriguing
aspects
of
titan
is
the
possibility
that
its
surface
may
be
covered
in
part
with
lakes
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
that
result
from
photochemical
processes
in
its
upper
atmosphere
these
hydrocarbons
condense
to
form
a
global
smog
layer
and
eventually
rain
down
onto
the
surface
the
cassini
orbiter
will
use
onboard
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
determine
if
there
is
liquid
on
the
surface
experiments
aboard
both
the
orbiter
and
the
entry
probe
will
investigate
the
chemical
processes
that
produce
this
unique
atmosphere
the
cassini
mission
is
named
for
jean
dominique
cassini
the
first
director
of
the
paris
observatory
who
discovered
several
of
saturns
satellites
and
the
major
division
in
its
rings
the
titan
atmospheric
entry
probe
is
named
for
the
dutch
physicist
christiaan

titan
iv
launches
aint
cheap
granted
but
thats
because
titan
ivs
are
bought
by
the
governemnt
titan
iii
is
actually
the
cheapest
way
to
put
a
pound
in
space
of
all
us
expendable
launchers
in
that
case
its
rather
ironic
that
they
are
doing
so
poorly
on
the
commercial
market
is
there
a
single
titan
iii
on
order
the
problem
with
commercial
titan
is
that
mm
has
made
little
or
no
attempt
to
market
it
theyre
basically
happy
with
their
government
business
and
dont
want
to
have
to
learn
how
to
sell
commercially
a
secondary
problem
is
that
it
is
a
bit
big
theyd
need
to
go
after
multisatellite
launches
a
la
ariane
and
that
complicates
the
marketing
task
quite
significantly
they
also
had
some
problems
with
launch
facilities
at
just
the
wrong
time
to
get
them
started
properly
if
memory
serves
the
pad
used
for
the
mars
observer
launch
had
just
come
out
of
heavy
refurbishment
work
that
had
prevented
launches
from
it
for
a
year
or
so
there
have
been
a
few
ct
launches
mars
observer
was
one
of
them
so
was
that
stranded
intelsat
and
at
least
one
of
its
brothers
that
reached
orbit
properly

recovery

the

uranium
reserves
are
estimated
at
about
million
tons
and
it
is
anticipated
that

will
collapse

in

a
resources
poor
country
technological

are
now
under
way
to

collect
uranium
dissolved
in

the
total
quanity
of
uranium
dissolved
in
seawater
is
estimated
to
be
about
billion
tons
a
huge
amount
when
compared
with
ground
uranium
reserves
i
hate
to
pour
cold
water
on
this
but
currently
seawater
extracted
uranium
even
using
the
new
improved
fiber
absorbers
from
japan
is
about
times
more
expensive
than
uranium
on
the
spot
market
uranium
is
very
cheap
right
now
around
right
now
there
are
mines
closing
because
they
cant
compete
with
places
like
cigar
lake
in
canada
where
the
ore
is
so
rich
they
present
safety
hazards
to
the
mines
who
work
in
shielded
vehicles
plenty
of
other
sources
for
example
uranium
from
phosphate
processing
would
come
on
line
before
uranium
reached
demand
and
supply
balance
will
collapse
is
nonsense
supply
and
demand
always
balance
what
changes
is
the
price
is
uranium
going
to
increase
in
price
by
a
factor
of
by
the
end
of
the
century
not
bloody
likely
new
nuclear
reactors
are
not
being
built
at
a
sufficient
rate
uranium
from
seawater
is
interesting
but
its
a
long

project
or
a
project
that
the
japanese

justify
on

the
reassignment
of

to
the
chief

position
is
this
just
a
meaningless
administrative
shuffle
or
does
this
bode
ill
for
sei
in
my
opinion
this
seems
like
a
bad
thing
at
least
on
the
surface
griffin
seemed
to
be
someone
who
was
actually
interested
in
getting
things
done
and
who
was
willing
to
look
an
innovative
approaches
to
getting
things
done
faster
better
and
cheaper
its
unclear
to
me
whether
he
will
be
able
to
do
this
at
his
new
position
does
anyone
know
what
his
new
duties
will
be
first
ive
heard
of
it
offhand
griffin
is
no
longer
an
office
head
so
thats
bad
on
the
other
hand
regress
seemed
to
think
we
cant
fund
anything
by
griffin
because
that
would
mean
and
we
have
the
lies
by
the
old
hardliners
about
the
billion
mars
mission
to
prove
it
that
we
would
be
buying
into
a
mission
to
mars
that
would
cost
billion
therefore
there
will
be
no
artemis
or
million

et

they
were
killing
griffins
main
program
simply
because
some
sycophants
somewhere
had

beleivin
that
to
do
so
would
simply
be
to
buy
into
the
same
old
stuff
sorta
like
not
giving
aid
to

because
hes
a
communist
hardliner
at

now
the

of
reforms
griffin

trying

bring

be
trapped
in
their
own

defunded

why
do

vertical

dont

they

just
turn
on

at

youre

why
not

fall

parachutes
are

constellation
ssf
is
up

lets
step
back
and
consider
the
functionality
we
want
microgravityvacuum
process
research
life
sciences
research
adaptation
to
space
spacecraft
maintenence
the
old
nasa
approach
explified
by
shuttle
and
ssf
so
far
was
to
centralize
functionality
these
projects
failed
to
meet
their
targets
by
a
wide
margin
the
military
and
commercial
users
took
most
of
their
payloads
off
shuttle
after
wasting
much
effort
to
tie
their
payloads
to
it
and
ssf
has
crumbled
into
disorganization
and
miscommunication
over
billion
has
been
spent
on
these
two
projects
with
no
reduction
in
launch
costs
and
littel
improvement
in
commercial
space
industrialization
meanwhile
military
and
commercial
users
have
come
up
with
a
superior
strategy
for
space
development
the
constellation
firstly
different
functions
are
broken
down
into
different
constellations
placed
in
the
optimal
orbit
for
each
function
thus
we
have
the
gpsnavstar
constellation
in
orbits
comsats
in
clarke
and
molniya
orbits
etc
secondly
the
task
is
distributed
amongst
several
spacecraft
in
a
constellation
providing
for
redundancy
and
full
coverage
where
needed
ssfs
main
functions
require
quite
different
environments
and
are
also
prime
candidates
for
constellization
we
have
the
makings
of
a
microgravity
constellation
now
comet
and
mir
for
longduration
flights
shuttlespacelab
for
shortduration
flights
the
best
strategy
for
this
area
is
inexpensive
incremental
improvement
installation
of
us
facilities
on
mir
shuttlemir
linkup
and
transition
from
shuttlespacelab
to
a
much
less
expensive
sstospacehabcomet
or
sstosifcomet
we
might
also
expand
the
research
program
to
take
advantage
of
interesting
space
environments
eg
the
highradiation
van
allen
belt
or
gasplasma
gradients
in
comet
tails
the
comet
system
can
be
much
more
easily
retrofitted
for
these
tasks
where
a
station
is
too
large
to
affordably
launch
beyond
leo
we
need
to
study
life
sciences
not
just
in
microgravity
but
also
in
lunar
and
martian
gravities
and
in
the
radiation
environments
of
deep
space
instead
of
the
protected
shelter
of
leo
this
is
a
very
longterm
lowpriority
project
since
astronauts
will
have
little
practical
use
in
the
space
program
until
costs
come
down
orders
of
magnitude
furthermore
using
astronauts
severely
restricts
the
scope
of
the
investigation
and
the
sample
size
so
i
propose
labratsat
a
constellation
tetherbolo
satellites
that
test
out
various
levels
of
gravity
in
supervanallenbelt
orbits
that
are
representative
of
the
radiation
environment
encountered
on
earthmoon
earthmars
earthasteroid
etc
trips
the
miniaturized
life
support
machinery
might
be
operated
realtime
from
earth
thru
a
vr
interface
after
several
orbital
missions
have
been
flown
followons
can
act
as
ldefs
on
the
lunar
and
martian
surface
testing
out
the
actual
environment
at
low
cost
before
billions
are
spent
on
astronauts
by
far
the
largest
market
for
spacecraft
servicing
is
in
clarke
orbit
i
propose
a
fleet
of
small
teleoperated
robots
and
small
test
satellites
on
which
ground
engineers
can
practice
their
skills
once
in
place
robots
can
pry
stuck
solar
arrays
and
antennas
attach
solar
battery
power
packs
inject
fuel
etc
once
the
fleet
is
working
it
can
be
spun
off
to
commercial
companys
who
can
work
with
the
comsat
companies
to
develop
comsat
replaceable
module
standards
by
applying
the
successful
constellation
strategy
and
getting
rid
of
the
failed
centralized
strategy
of
sts
and
old
ssf
we
have
radically
improved
the
capability
of
the
program
while
greatly
cutting
its
cost
for
a
fraction
of
ssfs
pricetag
we
can
fix
satellites
where
the
satellites
are
we
can
study
lifes
adaptation
to
a
much
large
more
representative
variety
of
space
environments
and
we
can
do
microgravity
and
vacuum
research
inexpensively
and
if
needed
in
specialpurpose
orbits
nb
we
can
apply
the
constellation
strategy
to
space
exploration
as
well
greatly
cutting
its
cost
and
increasing
its
functionality
mars
network
and
artemis
are
two
good
examples
of
this
more
ambitiously
we

fred
replies
no
tommy
i
admit
that
there
are
such
things
as
market
failures
which
necessitate
intervention
by
other
than
capitalist
forces
to
correct
i
guess
your
understanding
of
this
market
failure
should
be
classified
under
phils
economics
on
the
level
of
century
medicine
since
you
apparently
completely
ignored
that
this
market
failure
can
as
easily
or
even
much
more
easily
be
attributed
to
government
intervention
failure
so
in
addition
to
a
strong
moral
argument
against
what
you
propose
there
is
also
a
strong
utilitarian
argument
namely
that
govs
destruction
of
wealth
through
confiscastory
taxation
and
redistribution
on
a
major
scale
has
made
significant
private
capital
investments
harder
to
make
i
note
that
you
make
no
such
case
as
you
claim
can
be
even
more
easily
made
yes
the
argument
can
and
has
been
made
that
current
government
policy
creates
even
larger
market
barriers
than
there
were
in
the
first
place
but
there
is
no
such
term
as
government
failure
since
the
government
can
change
policies
whenever
it
pleases
the
market
doesnt
do
that
and
is
governed
by
relatively
wellunderstood
forces
this
libertopican
bilge
about
moral
arguments
about
taxation
etc
is
at

so
much
simplistic
economic
thinking
it
can
only
be

both
in

on

whether

by

upon
whether
the

tried

go

would
have
stretched
the
budgets
of
both

i
think
that
the

would

the
value
of
going

at

in

the

to
do
would
be
to
admit
your
criticism
on
scientific
grounds
was
invalid
rather
than
pretend
you
were
actually
talking
about
engineering
feasibility
given
you
postings
i
cant
say
i
am
surprised
though
well
pardon
me
for
trying
to
continue
the
discussion
rather
than
just
tugging
my
forelock
in
dismay
at
having
not
considered
actually
trying
to
recover
the
energy
from
this
process
which
is
at
least
trying
to
go
the
right
way
on
the

curve
now
where
did
i
put
those
sackcloth

i
was

am
not
pretending
anything
i
am
so
pleased
you
are
not
surprised
though
no
it
is
nothing
like
perpetual

note
that
i
didnt
say
it
was
perpetual
motion
or
even
that
it
sounded
like
perpetual

the
phrase
was
sounds
almost
like
perpetual
motion
which
i
at
least
consider
a
somewhat
different
propposition
than
the
one
you
elect
to
criticize
perhaps
i
should
beg
your
pardon
for
being
too
precise
in
my
use
of
language
the
physics
is
well
understood
the
energy
comes
from
fission
of
actinides
in
subcritical
assemblies
folks
have
talked
about
spallation
reactors
since
the
pulsed
spallation
neutron
sources
are
in
use
today
as
research
tools
accelerator
design
has
been
improving
particularly
with
superconducting
accelerating
cavities
which
helps
feasibility
los
alamos
has
expertise
in
high
current
accelerators
lampf
so
i
believe
they
know
what
they
are
talking
about
i
will
believe
that
this
process
comes
even
close
to
approaching
technological
and
economic
feasibility
given
the
mixed
nature
of
the
trash
that
will
have
to
be
run
through
it
as
opposed
to
the
costs
of
separating
things
first
and
having
a
different
run
for
each
actinide
when
i
see
them
dump
a
few
tons
in
one
end
and
pull
relatively
clean
material
out
the
other
once
the
costs
technological
risks
etc
are
taken
into
account
i
still
class
this
one
with
the
idea
of
throwing
waste
into
the
sun
sure
its
possible
and
the
physics
are
well
understood
but
is
it
really
a
reasonable
approach
and
i
still
wonder
at
what
sort
of
burning
rate
you
could
get
with
something
like
this
as
opposed
to
what
kind
of
energy
you
would
really
recover
as
opposed
to
what
it
would
cost
to
build
and
power
with
and
without
the
energy
recovery
are
we
talking
ounces
pounds
or
tons
grams
kilograms
or
metric
tons
for
you
si
fans
of
material
and
are
we

months
or

days
weeks

or

still
using
a
nondecimated
time
scale
i
see
the
real
reason
why
accelerator
breeders
or
incinerators
are
not
being
built
is
that
there
isnt
any
reason
to
do
so
natural
uranium
is
still
too
cheap
and
geological
disposal
of
actinides
looks
technically
reasonable
insisting

elijah
millgram
writes
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
were
wondering
where
the
expression
pushing
the
envelope
comes
from
anyone
out
there
know
every
aircraft
has
flight
constraints
for
speedaoapower
when
graphed
these
define
the
flight
envelope
of
that
aircraft
presumably
so
named
because
the
graphed
line
encloses
envelopes
the
area
on
the
graph
that
represents
conditions
where
the
aircraft
doesnt
fall
out
of
the
sky
hence
pushing
the
envelope
becomes
operating
at
or
beyond
the
edge
of
the
flight
or
operational
envelope
note
that
the
envelope
isnt
precisely
known
until
someone
actually
flies
the
airplane
in
those
regions
up
to
that
point
all
there
are
are
the
theoretical
predictions
hence
one
of
the
things
test
pilots
do
for
a
living
is
push
the
envelope
to
find
out
how
close
the
correspondence
between
the
paper
airplane
and
the
metal
one
is
in
essence
pushing
back
the
edges
of
the
theoretical
envelope
to
where
the
airplane
actually
starts
to
fail
to
fly
note
too
that
this
is
done
is
a
quite
calculated
and
careful
way
flight
tests
are
generally
carefully
coreographed
and
just
what
is
going
to
be
pushed
and
how
far
is
precisely
planned
despite
occasional
deviations
from
plans
such
as
the
early

flight
of
the
during
its
highspeed

sure
mary
can
tell
you
everything
you
ever
wanted

know
about

then
some

would
outweigh
the
value
of
going

at

in

thus
we

concentrated

then
taking

type

bad
example
i

at

its
an

to

craft

then
to
take
all

figure
out
exactly
what
the

are

demonstrate

that

i
have
it
on

authority
that
just
this

is
shaping
up
in
the

it
seems
that
the

have

up

breifing
recollections
the
following
are
my
thoughts
on
a
meeting
that
i
hugh
kelso
and
bob
lilly
had
with
an
aide
of
sen
patty
murrays
we
were
there
to
discuss
ssto
and
commercial
space
this
is
how
it
went
after
receiving
a
packet
containing
a
presentation
on
the
benifits
of
ssto
i
called
and
tried
to
schedule
a
meeting
with
our
local
senator
d
patty
murray
washington
state
i
started
asking
for
an
hour
and
when
i
heard
the
gasp
on
the
end
of
the
phone
i
quickly
backed
off
to
an
hour
later
in
that
conversation
i
learned
that
a
standard
appointment
is
minutes
we
got
the
standard
bozo
treatment
that
is
we
were
called
back
by
an
aide
who
scheduled
a
meeting
with
us
in
order
to
determine
that
we
were
not
bozos
and
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
material
and
to
screen
it
to
make
sure
that
it
was
appropriate
to
take
the
senators
time
with
that
material
well
i
got
allocated
hour
with
sen
murrays
aide
and
we
ended
up
talking
to
him
for
minutes
with
us
ending
the
meeting
and
him
still
listening
we
covered
a
lot
of
ground
and
only
a
little
tiny
bit
was
dcx
specific
most
of
it
was
a
single
stage
reusable
vehicle
primer
there
was
another
woman
there
who
took
copius
quantities
of
notes
on
every
topic
that
we
brought
up
but
with
murray
being
new
we
wanted
to
entrench
ourselves
as
noncorporate
aligned
ie
not
speaking
for
boeing
local
citizens
interentested
in
space
so
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
covering
the
benifits
of
lower
cost
access
to
leo
solar
power
satellites
are
a
big
focus
here
so
we
hit
them
as
becoming
feasible
with
lower
cost
access
and
we
hit
the
environmental
stand
on
that
we
hit
the
tourism
angle
and
i
left
a
copy
of
the
patric
collins
tourism
paper
with
side
notes
being
that
everyone
who
goes
into
space
and
sees
the
atmosphere
becomes
more
of
an
environmentalist
esp
after
seeing
the
smog
over
la
we
hit
on
the
benifits
of
studying
bone
decalcification
which
is
more
pronounced
in
space
and
said
that
that
had
potential
to
lead
to
understanding
of
and
maybe
a
cure
for
osteoporosis
we
hit
the
education
whereby
kids
get
enthused
by
space
but
as
they
get
older
and
find
out
that
they
havent
a
hop
in
hell
of
actually
getting
there
they
go
on
to
other
fields
with
low
cost
to
orbit
the
chances
they
might
get
there
someday
would
provide
greater
incentive
to
hit
the
harder
classes
needed
we
hit
a
little
of
the
get
nasa
out
of
the
operational
launch
vehicle
business
angle
we
hit
the
lower
cost
of
satellite
launches
gps
navigation
personal
communicators
tellecommunications
new
services
etc
jobs
provided
in
those
sectors
jobs
provided
building
the
thing
balance
of
trade
improvement
etc
we
mentioned
that
skypix
would
benifit
from
lower
launch
costs
we
left
the
paper
on
what
technologies
needed
to
be
invested
in
in
order
to
make
this
even
easier
to
do
and
he
asked
questions
on
this
point
we
ended
by
telling
her
that
we
wanted
her
to
be
aware
that
efforts
are
proceeding
in
this
area
and
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
results
from
these
efforts
are
not
lost
much
like
condor
or
majellan
and
most
importantly
we
asked
that
she
help
fund
further
efforts
along
the
lines
of
lowering
the
cost
to
leo
in
the
middle
we
also
gave
a
little
speal
about
the
lunar
resource
data
purchase
act
and
the
guy
filed
it
separately
he
was
very
interested
in
it
he
asked
some
questions
about
it
and
seemed
like
he
wanted
to
jump
on
it
and
contact
some
of
the
people
involved
with
it
so
something
may
actually
happen
immediatly
there
the
last
two
things
we
did
were
to
make
sure
that
they
knew
that
we
knew
a
lot
of
people
in
the
space
arena
here
in
town
and
that
they
could
feel
free
to
call
us
any
time
with
questions
and
if
we
didnt
know
the
answers
that
we
would
see
to
it
that
they
questions
got
to
people
who
really
did
know
the
answers
then
finally
we
asked
for
an
appointment
with
the
senator
herself
he
said
that
we
would
get
on
the
list
and
he
also
said
that
knowing
her
this
would
be
something
that
she
would
be
very
interested
in
although
they
do
have
a
time
problem
getting
her
scheduled
since
she
is
only
in
the
state
week
out
of
these
days
all
in
all
we
felt
like
we
did
a
pretty

that

two
sightings
at
drastically
different
times
of
a
small
planet
that
was
inside

beyond
that
i
have
no
other
info
the
sightings
were
apparently
spurious
there
is
no
planet
inside
of
the
orbit
of
mercury
the
idea
of
vulcan
came
from
the
differences
between
mercurys
observed
perihelion
precession
and
the
value
it
should
have
had
according
to
newtonian
physics
leverrier
made
an
extensive
set
of
observations
and
calculations
during
the
mid
century
and
simon
newcombe
later
improved
on
the
observations
and
recalculated
using
leverriers
system
of
equations
now
leverrier
was
one
of
the
codiscoverers
of
neptune
and
since
he
had
predicted
its
existence
based
on
anomalies
in
the
orbit
of
uranus
his
inclination
was
to
believe
the
same
sort
of
thing
was
afoot
with
mercury
but
alas
twere
not
so
mercurys
perihelion
precesses
at
the
rate
it
does
because
the
space
where
it
resides
near
the
sun
is
significantly
curved
due
to
the
suns
mass
this
explanation
had
to
wait
until
and
albert
einsteins
synthesis
of
his
earlier
theory
of
the
electrodynamics
of
moving
bodies
commonly
called
special
relativity
with
reimanian
geometry
the
result
was
the
general
theory
of
relativity
and
one
of
its
most
noteworthy
strengths
is
that
it
accounts
for
the
precession
of
mercurys
perihelion
almost
exactly
exactly
if
you
use
newcombs
numbers
rather
than
leverriers
of
course
not
everybody
believes
einstein
and
thats
fine
but
subsequent
efforts
to
find
any
planets
closer
to
the

than
mercury
using

have
been
fruitless

rule
i

mary
or
henry
can
describe
this
more
aptly
then
me
but
here
is
how
i
understand
it
at
speed
near
supersonic
the
wind
behaves
like
a
fluid
pipe
it
becomes
incompressible
so
wind
has
to
bend
away
from
the
wing
edges
as
the
wing
thickens
the
more
the
pipes
bend
if
they
have
no
place
to
go
they
begin
to
stall
and
force
compression
stealing
power
from
the
vehicle
high
drag
if
you
squeeze
the
fuselage
so
that
these
pipes
have
aplace
to
bend
into
then
drag
is
reduced
essentially
teh
cross
sectional
area
of
the
aircraft
shoulf
remain
constant
for
all
areas
of
the
fuselage
that
is
where
the
wings
are

a

considered
by

each

would
cover
the

to
consider
gibbons
also
announced
that
the
united

and
its
international
partners
the
europeans
japanese
and
canadians
have
decided
after
consultation
to
give
full
consideration
to
use

in
the

of
the

process
to
that
end
the
russians
will
be
asked
to
participate

on

basis
so
that
the

can
make

in
assessing
the

and
the
possible
use
of

other
russian

the
us
and
international
partners
hope
to
benefit
from
the
expertise
of
the
russian
participants
in
assessing
russian
systems
and
technology
the
overall
goal
of
the
redesign
effort
is
to
develop
options
for
reducing
station
costs
while
preserving
key
research
and
exploration
capabilities
careful
integration
of
russian
assets
could
be
a
key
factor
in
achieving
that
goal
gibbons
reiterated
that
president

is
committed
to
the
redesigned

station
and
to
making
every
effort
to
preserve
the
science
the

and
the

that

represents
however
he
also
is
committed
to
a

was
that
there

him
and
the
lead
time
on
an

yesterday
the

oconnor
is
quoted
saying
whether
it
is
possible
to
cut
costs
that
much
and
still
provide
for
meaningful
research
is
a
real
question
for
me
oconnor
said
everything
is
fair
game
including
dropping
or
curtailing
existing
contracts
with
the
aerospace
industry
chopping
management
of
the

oconnor
says
his
team
has
reviewed
design
options
so
far
and
they
are
sorting
the
serious
candidates
into
three
categories
based
on
cost
the
post
says
oconnor
described
the
design
derived
from
the
current
ssf
as
a
high
cost
option
i

kathy

the

i

oconnors
briefing

monday
and
in
one
part
of
the
briefing
oconnor
talked
about
how
the
white
house
wants
three
options
sorted
by
cost
low
medium
and
high
in
another
part
of
the
briefing
he
discussed
the
three
teams
he
has
formed
to
look
at
three
options
ssf

jsc
later
in
response
to
a
reporters
question
i
thought
i
heard
oconnor
say
the
option
based
on
a
ssf
redesign
was
a
moderate
cost
option
in
between
low
high
cost
options
not
the
high
cost
option
as
sawyer
wrote
the
article
goes
on
to
describe
the
other
two
options
as
one
features
modules
that
could
gradually
be
fitted
together
in
orbit
similar
to
the
russian
mir
the
other
is
a
core
facility
that
could
be
deposited
in
orbit
in
a
single
launch
like
skylab
that
option
would
use
existing
hardware
from
the

shuttle
the
fuselage
for

in
its

structure
the
last
sentence

is

the

skims
off
a

goes

what
amounts

a
slush

this

is
used

fund
work
the

manager
wants
to
fund
this
sum
is
estimated
to
be
over

about
that
of

fully
billion
wont

congress

congress
has
never

they

the

they

my
dear
friends
your
mixing
fact
and
fiction
here
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
i
first
read
this
in
your
posting
i
talked
with
one
of
the
cost
experts
here
in
space
station
at
headquarters
if
you
wondering
why
i
didnt
post
a
response
immediately
i
do
have
a
real
job
im
supposed
to
be
doing
here
at
headquarters
digging
up
old
khz
data
looking
into
sherzerkyger
claims
rates
pretty
low
on
the
totem
pole
of
priority
also
i
spent
last
weekend
in
kansas
city
at
the
national
science
teachers
association
conference
extolling
the
virtues
of
ssf
to
science
teachers
first
off
yes
the
concept
of
center
tax
or
wrap
does
exist
if
i
recall
the
numbers
correctly
the
total
tax
for
the
ssf
program
for
this
fiscal
year
is
around
million
this
was
computed
by
adding
up
the
and
center
taxes
with
the
ssf
budget
for
this
fiscal
year
at
billion
my
calculater
says
the
tax
percentage
is
over
the
life
of
the
ssf
program
using
your
figure
of
billion
for
the
cost
of
ssf
a
tax
at
a
rate
comes
to
million
this
is
alot
less
than
billion
but
i
will
concede
its
still
an
appreciable
amount
of
pocket
change
i
should
note
that
your
estimate
of
the
tax
rate
at
could
be
close
to
the
actual
rate
the
tax
is
only
charged
on
funds
that
are
spent
at
the
center
kind
of
like
mcdonalds
at
some
states
where
you
do
have
to
pay
sales
tax
if
you
eat
the
food
at
the
restaurant
but
you
dont
if
you
get
it
takeout
for
example
at
the
vast
bulk
of
the
funds
we
receive
go
to
the
rocketdyne
contract
and
are
not
subject
to
the
center
tax
i
dont
have
the
numbers
in
front
of
me
but
id
guess
at
least
of
the
funds
go
to
rocketdyne
so
you
could
be
right
about
a
tax
rate
of
but
its
only
applied
to
funds
spent
at
the
center
and
not
to
the
prime
contracts
this
leads
to
the
obvious
question
what
is
the
government
doing
with
ssf
funds
that
dont
go
to
the
prime
contractors
ie
ok
gets
a
slice
of
the
billion
pie
a
big
portion
of
this
slice
goes
to
rocketdyne
what
happens
to
the
balance
of
the
funds
which
arent
eaten
up
by
the
center
tax
at
we
call
these
funds
we
spend
inhouse
supporting
development
funds
as
they
are
supporting
the
development
work
done
by
rocketdyne
we
have
used
these
funds
to
setup
our
own
testbed
to
checkout
the
electrical
power
system
architecture
our
testbed
has
a
real
life
solar
array
field
left
over
from
solar
cell
research
research
a
few
years
back
with
leadacid
car
batteries
to
simulate
the
nickelhydrogen
batteries
on
ssf
dc
switchgear
dcdc
converter
units
and
simulated
loads
data
from
the
testbed
was
used
in
a
recent
change
evaluation
involving
concerns
about
the
stability
of
the
power
system
we
have
also
used
the
supporting
development
money
to
purchase
nickel
hydrogen
batteries
which
are
on
life
testing
at
both
lewis
and
the
crane
naval
facility
in
indiana
as
a
side
point
of
the
battery
cells
on
test
recently
hit
the
four
year
life
test
milestone
cells
have
completed
to
cycles
the
onorbit
batteries
go
through
cycles
per
year
as
a
final
example
my
home
division
at
lewis
used
the
supporting
development
funds
to
purchase
personal
computers
and
work
stations
for
performing
system
analyses
like
modeling
of
the
performance
of
the
electrical
power
system
availability
calculations
using
a
montecarlo
simulation
setting
up
a
database
with
information
on
weight
of
the
power
system
elements
finally
the
money
raised
by
the
tax
does
not
all
go
into
a
slush
fund
at
lewis
the
director
does
control
a
small
discretionary
fund
each
year
any
individual
at
lewis
can
submit
a
proposal
to
the
director
to
get
money
from
this
fund
to
look
at
pretty
much
anything
within
the
lewis
charter
most
of
the
tax
however
goes
to
fund
the
general
services
at
the
center
like
the
library
the
central
computer
services
division
the
contractor
who
removes
the
snow
etc
thus
it
is
rather
difficult
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
ssf
budget
doesnt
go
for
ssf
activities
to
get
an
accurate
figure
you
would
have
to
take
the
annual
expenditure
for
the
library
for
example
and
then
divide
by
the
amount
of
the
library
funds
used
to
support
ssf
which
would
be
hard
to
compute
by
itself
how
would
you
figure
out
what
percentage
of
the
bill
for
aviation
week
for
year
is
billable
to
ssf
would
you
base
it
on
the
personhours
ssf
employees
spend
reading
avweek
versus
the
rest
of
the
center
personnel
you
would
then
have
to
compare
this
estimate
of
the
ssf
portion
of
the
library
expense
with
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
goes
to
support
the
library
who
knows
maybe
ssf
overpays
on
the
tax
to
run
the
library
but
we
underpay
for
snow
removal
talk
about
a
burecratic
nightmare
my
last
point
is
that
i
cant
believe
your
claim
that
congress
has
never
heard
of
the
term
center
tax
unfortunately
all
of
the
nasa
testimony
before
congress
isnt
on
a
computer
so
i
cant
do
a
simple
word
search
someplace
to
prove
you
wrong
but
surely
in
some
gao
audit
somewhere
these
nasa
cost
methods
were

a

sdio
originally
funded
ssto
research
as
a
way
to
cut
the
costs
for
orbital
deployments
of
spacebased
sensors
and
weapns
however
recent
changes
in
sdis
political
marching
orders
and
budget
cuts
have
made
ssto
less

a
priority
today
the
agency
is
more
interested
in
using
dcx
as
a
step
towards
a
lowcost
reusable
sounding
rocket
sdio
has
already
done
briefings
to
other
government
agencies
said
col
simon
pete
worden
sdios
deputy
for

but
worden
declined
to
say
how
much
the
agencies
would
have
to
pony
up
for
the
program
i
didnt
make

by
telling
my

how

i
have

agency
officials
hail
the
dcx
as
an
example
of
the
better

cheaper
approach
to
hardware
development
the
agency
believes
this
philosophy
can
produce
breakthroughs
that
leapfrog
ahead
of
evolutionary
technology
developments
worden
said
the
dcx
illustrates
how
a
build
a
little
test
a
little
approach
can
produce
results
on
time
and
within
budget
he
said
the
program
which
went
from
concept
to
hardware
in
around
months
showed
how
todays
engineers
could
move
beyond
the
miracles
of
our
parents
time
the
key
is
management
worden
said
sdio
had
a
very
light
hand
on
this
project
we
had
only
one
overworked
major
jess
sponable
although
the
next
phase
may
involve
more
agencies
worden
said
lean
management
and
a
sense

partnership
will
be
crucial
its
essential
we
do
not

mcdonnell

senior

for

you
need
strong

investments
while
the
government
and

continue
to
differ
on
funding
for
the

they
agree
on
continuing
an

approach
to
development

they
liken
the

flight
tests
this
summer
at

will
expand
the

performance
with
successive

increasing
speed
and
altitude
the
first
tests
will
reach
feet
and
demonstrate
hovering
verticle
takeoff
and

the

will
send
the
unmanned

up

the
third
and
final
series
will
take
the
craft
up
to

maneuvers
will
become

the

will
include
a
pitchover

rotates

will
become
a

this

would
have
more
thrust
than
the
pratt
whitney

used
on

each

technology
developed
in

union
the
resulting

could
burn

then

gibbons
also
announced
that
the
united

its
international

the

have
decided
after
consultation
to
give
full
consideration
to
use

russian
assets
in
the
course
of
the

redesign
process
to
that
end
the
russians
will
be
asked

on

basis
so
that
the

can
make
use

the

and
the
possible
use

the
us
and
international
partners
hope
to
benefit
from
the
expertise
of
the
russian
participants
in
assessing
russian
systems
and
technology
the
overall
goal
of
the
redesign
effort
is
to
develop
options
for
reducing
station
costs
while
preserving
key
research
and
exploration
capabilitiaes
careful
integration
of
russian

could
be
a
key
factor
in
achieving
that
goal
gibbons
reiterated
that

is
committed

and
to
making
every
effort
to
preserve
the
science
the

represents
however
he
also
is

all

fred
not

do
you
do

on

honestly
reporting
your

on
matters
of
policy
and
projects
in

but
your
response
was
just
baiting
not
even
part

i
have
yet
to
see

anything
remotely

i
see
him
flame
anyone

anything
who
disagrees

true

i
see

attacking

calling

nick
i
see

because
they
had

god

but
debate
bwaaaaahhhaaaa
im
glad
you
can
laugh
since
your
ratio
of
debateinsult
is
about
the
same
not
even
close
tommy
and
generally
only
when
im
dealing
with
someone
like
nick
i
see
we
are
dealing
with
a
problem
in
a
conflict
of
interpretations
not
least
of
which
is
your
belief
that
only
you
can
adequately
judge
what
is
and
is
not
debate
suffice
to
say
that
i
disagree
with
you
on
that
last
point
why
dont
you
take
a
poll
fred
if
you
want
some
psuedoobjective
pointofview
and
as
usual
you
defend
your
insults
with
he
started
it
yeah
i
took
some
of
his
research
and
called
it
my
own
but
he
started
it
so
what
if
i
stole
his
car
he
stole
my
lawnmower
first
besides
that
i
think
its
still
open
to
interpretation
whether
nick
actually
did
start
it
so
your
defense
besides
being
lame
and
contradicting
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
in
which
it
occurs
may
not
even
apply
anyway
your
defense
reminds

borrowed
it
i
already
gave
it
back
and
it
was
broken
when
you
gave
it
to
me
make
up
yer
mind
fred
im
not
convinced
that
people
are
necessary
in
all
parts
of
every
space
based
process
and
your
response
doesnt
tell
me
a
thing
about
the
reasons
why
you
think
they
should
be
except
to
impune
the
motives
of
the
person
with
a
divergent
opinion
who
said
i
think
they
should
be
tommy
show
me
a
note
where
i
said
that
and
ill
eat
this
terminal
see
below
fred
fred
i
cocluded
that
you
did
since
you
took
issue
with
it
the
fact
that
my
conclusion
was
incorrect
ie
that
you
were
taking
issue
with
something
different
is
evidence
that
your
communication
style
is
confusing
or
evidence
that
your
reading
and
comprehension
style
are
inadequate
first
i
try
to
address
what
i
think
you
meant
for
which
i
am
rewarded
with
a
denial
of
sorts
and
a
smart
remark
then
i
point
out
that
i
am
not
clear
what
you
did
mean
rather
than
risking
your
childish
ire
wrongly
interpreting
you
a
second
time
and
im
stupid
for
it
i
just
cant
win
can
i
fred
youve
got
a
great
point
here
somewhere
its
just
that
between
stupid
people
that
you
must
insult
and
your
jealous
guarding
of
your
valuable
opinions
you
never
actually
get
around
to
making
it
please
quote
the
it
i
took
issue
with
i
believe
you
will
see
if
you
look
that
what
i
was
and
am
taking
issue
with
is
mr
szabos
idea
that
the
manned
program
should
be
scrapped
until
such
time
as
his
toasterbased
infrastructure
is
finished
all
hail
the
szabo
plan
fred
issue
nicks
alleged
meaning
too
bad
the
plan
only
exists
in
your
mind
instead
of
nicks
or
you
would
have
a
really
good
point
instead
you
have
provided
a
good
reason
to
ignore
your
insults
since
they
are
based
on
incorrect
interpretations
that
you
have
made
about
others
forgive
me
for
giving
your
insults
more
meaning
than
they
ever
should
have
had
my
reading
of
what
nick
actually
said
is
that
people
arent
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
your
taking
issue
with
his
opinions
regarding
people
in
the
space
program
i
read
as
people
are
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
help
me
out
here
fred
since
im
so
patently
stupid
did
you
read
nick
wrong
or
are
you
going
to
eat
your
terminal
now
if
the
latter
i
sure
hope
its
one
of
those
cheeto
and
string
models
that
all
the
computer
mags
have
been
raving
about
the
point
is
i
am
not
stupid
because
of
your
incorrect
assumption
id
only
be
stupid
if
i
insulted
you
for
having
made
it
but
alas
thats
your
job
fred
and
finally
your
style
is
confusing
since
you
tried
to
make
two
points
simultaneously
with
an
allegoryinsult
sadly
one
point
addressed
a
plan
that
only
existed
in
your
mind
and
the
other
took
issue
with
behaviors
that
you
do
as
much
as
anyone
more
deliberate
lack
of
understanding
tommy
no
no
i
finally
got
it
you
dont
like
the
plan
that
nicks
posts
made
you
imagine
and
you
dont
like
nicks
obnoxious
behavior
even
though
its
no
worse
than
your
own
thanks
for
taking
the
time
with
someone
as
dense
as
myself
if
you
have
a
problem
with
nicks
delivery
address
that
the
way
you
bait
youre
perpetuating
the
lack
of
discourse
that
you
complain
of
no
tommy
the
bait
is
that
which
elicits
the
response
nick
baits
i
just
flame
him
for
being
an
obnoxious
fool
i
dont
really
care
who
started
it
i
read
this
list
to
get
information
and
others
views
on
the
issues
to
which
it
was
dedicated
not
to
be
your
mom
he
started
it
no
he
did
or
to
hear
about
why
nick
is
a
very
bad
guy
if
you
think
flaming
is
bad
stop
flaming
or
at
least
get
to
the
point
in
the
first
post
instead
of
explaining
yourself
all
the
time
thats
nice
tommy
when
you
pay
me
to
post
to
the
net
you
can
complain
about
not
getting
your
moneys
worth
perhaps
if
you
werent
deliberately
too
thick
to
get
the
point
the
first
time
i
wouldnt
have
to
waste
time
explaining
myself
all
the
time
of
course
socrates
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
think
its
neat
how
all
this
criticism
from
you
started
after
your
fatherly
admonitions
to
me
about
how
such
things
should
be
handled
outside
usenet
were
somewhat
rebuffed
being
a
little
hypocritical
tommy
to
go
with
the
immaturity
or
is
this
just
the
pique
of
a
netghod
wannabe
who
got
turned
down
by
someone
he
thought
was
new
and
hence
could
be
instructed
tommy
i
saw
you
come
on
the
net
who
cares
who
came
on
the
net
first
if
you
do
consider
that
you
saw
me
come
on
after
a
brief
haitus
before
which
i
was
on
for
about
years
if
you
had
seen
me
on
the
net
first
youd
remember
when
nick
and
i
went
down
exactly
the
same
road
regarding
rude
unneccesary
behavior
its
just
amazing
to
me
that
you
continue
to
take
issue
with
behavior
thats
no
worse
than
your
own
lets
see
here
my
complaints
about
your
obnoxious
behavior
are
hypocritical
while
your
flames
against
people
you
decide
are
flamers
isnt
and
my
complaints
about
your
namecalling
are
immature
while
your
namecalling
isnt
yeah
right
maybe
if
you
called
me
some
more
names
i
might
see
it
better
fred
netghod
wannabe
naturally
fred
youve
correctly
interpreted
my
motivations
when
yours
are
impossible
to
judge
from
your
actions
as
your
insulting
of
people
that
try
proves
i
didnt
really
care
about
people
that
fill
the
net
with
personal
garbage
what
i
really
wanted
was
to
impress
everyone
i
only
put
my
complaints
with
your
behavior
on
private
mail
not
because
it
belongs
there
but
because
i
thought
you
were
such
a
jerk
that
youd
bring
it
back
to
the
net
playing
right
into
my
hands
alas
i
had
no
idea
what
an
intellectual
master
you
were
turning
tables
and
bringing
the
history
of
these
posts
to
the
net
for
the
noble
and
valuable
purpose
of
embarassing
me
whether
i
should
feel
stupid
because
i
tried
to
make
suggestions
to
such
a
superior
intellect
or
becuase
i
tried
to
communicate
like
an
adult
with
a
selfrighteous
ass
still
isnt
clear
well
fred
you
exposed
me
now
ill
never

they
all

well
i

now
i

the

jpl
is
actively
involved
in
the
study
of
ozone
and
the
atmosphere
in
three
important
ways
said
dr
jim
margitan
principal
investigator
on
the
balloon
research
campaign
there
are
two
jpl
instruments
on
the
uars
satellite
he
continued
the
atmos
experiment
is
conducted
by
jpl
scientists
and
the
jpl
balloon
research
provides
collaborative
ground
truth
for
those
activities
as
well
as
data
that
is
useful
in
its
own
right
the
measurements
taken
by
the

payload
will
add

pieces
to
the
complex
puzzle
of
the

specifically
the
midlatitude
stratosphere
during

the
chemistry
occurring
in
this
region
helps
scientists
construct
more
accurate
computer
models
which
are
instrumental
in
predicting
future
ozone
conditions
the
scientific
balloon
payload
consisted
of
three
jpl
instruments
an
ultraviolet
ozone
photometer
which
measures
ozone
as
the
balloon
ascends
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
a
submillimeterwave
limb
sounder
which
looks
at
microwave
radiation
emitted
by

in

and
a

monitors
how

launch
occurred
at
about
noontime
and
following
a
three

the
balloon
floated
eastward
at
approximately
kilometers

was
radioed
to
ground

recorded
onboard
the
flight
ended
at
pm
pacific
time
in
eastern
new
mexico
when
the
payload
was
commanded
to
separate
from
the
balloon
we
needed
to
fly
through
sunset
to
make
the
infrared
measurements
margitan
explained
and
we
also
needed
to
fly
in
darkness
to
watch
how
quickly
some
of
the
molecules
disappear
it
will
be
several
weeks
before
scientists
will
have
the
completed
results
of
their
experiments
they
will
then
forward
their

i
was
just

if
we
could
have
some

of
update
on
dcx
well
it
rolled
out
two
weeks

as
we
speak
it
is
at

getting

i
would
have
called
my
sources
for
the
latest
but
they
are
all
out

in
nm
as
for
the
future
there
is
at
least
in
next
years
budget
for
work
on
ssrt
they
sdio
have
been
looking
for
more
funds
and
do
seem
to
have
some
however
sdio
is
not
i
repeat
is
not
going
to
fund
an
orbital
prototype
the
best
we
can
hope
from
them
is
to
keep
it
alive
for
another
year
and
fund
a
suborbital
vehicle
which
might
with
major
modifications
just
make
orbit
there
is
also
some
money
for
a
set
of
prototype
tanks

projects
to

a

the

this
would
be

bring

now
not
all

will
go

a

could
be

its

hard
to
arrange

this
sort

is
reasonably
safe
if
handled
properly
proper

takes
more
care
and
you
need
a

more
empty

to

its
basically
just
model

scaled
up
as
with

the

a
similar
statement
in
our
local
news
utah
tonight
they
referred
to
the
tool
as
the
pliers
that
took
a
ride
into
space
they
also
said
that
a
thiokol
sp
employee
had
reported
missing
a
tool
of
some
kind
during
assembly
of
one
srb
i
assume
then
that
someone
at
thiokol
put
on
their
managers
hat
and
said
that
pissing
off
the
customer
by
delaying
shipment
of
the
srb
to
look
inside
it
was
a
bad
idea
regardless
of
where
that
tool
might
have
ended
up
why
do
i
get
the
feeling
that
thiokol
managers
hats
are
shaped

quick
everyone

a

then
we
can

just
what

get

for

at

all

re

lets
see
these
arent
in
a
strict
sense
amateur
rockets
that
term
denotes
rockets
the
engines
of
which
are
constructed
by
the
user
the
rockets
you
describe
are
called
hpr
or
high
power
rockets
to
distinguish
them
from
smaller
model
rockets
they
use
factorymade
ammonium
perchlorate
composite
propellants
in
phenolic
plastic
engines
with
graphite
nozzles
the
engines
are
classified
by
impulse
a
d
engine
for
example
can
have
no
more
than
newtonseconds
of
impulse
an
f
engine
can
have
no
more
than
ns
each
letter
corresponds
to
a
doubling
of
the
maximum
impulse
so
far
engines
up
to
size
o
are
available
pretty
much
off
the
shelf
engines
of

h

are

mission
spent
a
while
in

highly
eccentric
earth
orbit
doing
lunar
flybys
and
then
was
inserted
into
lunar
orbit
using
some
very
tricky
gravityassistlike
maneuvering
this
meant
that
it
would
crash
on
the
moon
eventually
since
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
stable
lunar
orbit
as
far
as
anyone
knows
and
i
believe
i
recall
hearing
recently
that
it
was
about
to
happen
the
gravity
maneuvering
that
was
used
was
to
exploit
fuzzy
regions
these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the
secondorder
perturbations
in
a
three
body
system
the
probe
was
launched
into
this
region
for
the
earthmoonsun
system
where
the
perturbations
affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural
objects
sometimes
get
captured
without
expending
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectory
that
makes
it
possible
the
originator
of
the
technique
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interested
but
that
japan
was
because
their
probe
was
small
and
couldnt
hold
a
lot
of
fuel
for
deceleration
this
from
an
issue
of
science
news
or
the
planetary
report

believe
about

orion
drive
in

how
background
the
orion
spacedrive
was
a
theoretical
concept
it
would
be
a
drive
using
thermonuclear
explosions
to
drive
a
spacecraft
the
idea
was
that
youd
detonate
devices
with
somewhere
from
one
to
ten
megatons
yield
behind
a
pusher
plate
attached
to
the
main
spacecraft
the
shock
wave
from
the
explosions
would
transfer
momentum
to
the
ship
now
in
an
atmosphere
i
can
see
this
the
energy
of
the
explosion
heats
the
atmosphere
which
expands
explosively
and
slams
a
shock
wave
into
the
pusher
plate
but
in
a
vacuum
only
two
things
i
can

are
going

hit

oh
that
guy
again
writes
the
gravity
maneuvering
that
was
used
was
to
exploit
fuzzy
regions
these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the
secondorder
perturbations
in
a
three
body
system
the
probe
was
launched
into
this
region
for
the
earthmoonsun
system
where
the
perturbations
affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural
objects
sometimes
get
captured
without
expending
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectory
that
makes
it
possible
the
originator
of
the
technique
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interested
but
that
japan
was
because
their
probe
was
small
and
couldnt
hold
a
lot
of
fuel
for
deceleration
i
should
probably
repost
this
with
another
title
so
that
the
guys
on
the
other
thread
would
see
that
this
is
a
practical
use
of
temporary
orbits

there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
stable
lunar
orbit
is
it
right
that
is
new
stuff
for
me
so
it
means
that
you
just
can
not
put
a
sattellite
around
around
the
moon
for
too
long
because
its
orbit
will
be
unstable
if
so
what
is
the
reason
is
that
because
the
combined
gravitacional
atraction
of
the
sunmoon
and
earth
that
does
not
provide
a
stable
orbit
around
the
moon
any
lunar
satellite
needs
fuel
to
do
regular
orbit
corrections
and
when
its
fuel
runs
out
it
will
crash
within
months
the
orbits
of
the
apollo
motherships
changed
noticeably
during
lunar
missions
lasting
only
a
few
days
it
is
possible
that
there
are
stable
orbits
here
and
there
the
moons
gravitational
field
is
poorly
mapped
but
we
know
of
none
perturbations
from
sun
and
earth
are
relatively
minor
issues
at
low
altitudes
the
big
problem
is
that
the
moons
own
gravitational
field
is
quite
lumpy
due
to
the
irregular
distribution
of
mass
within
the
moon

thiokol
provided
me
with
samples
and
data
on
a
reinforcement
to
solid
motor
grains
for
high
accelerations
solid
motor
propellants
usually
have
a
substantial
percentage
of
aluminum
in
the
mix
for
example
the
space
shuttle
srbs
are
percent
aluminum
the
technique
is
to
use
a
foamed
aluminum
structure
the
structure
looks
like
the
inverse
of
a
set
of
bubbles
an
i
suspect
some
bubbling
process
is
used
to
form
it
in
other
words
if
you
made
a
bunch
of
bubbles
in
molten
aluminum
then
froze
it
this
is
what
you
get
it
forms
a
strong
network
of
effectively
aluminum
wires
in
all
directions
the
remaining
solid
fuel
mix
is
infiltrated
into
the
voids
and
you
get
aluminumreinforced
solid
propellant
the
foamedaluminum
makes
up
about
percent
of
the
total
propellant
so
there
is
still
aluminum
particles
in
the
bulk
grain
the
major
improvement
is
the
higher
resistance
to
grain
cracking
which
is
the
principal
failure
mode
for
solid
propellant

re
guns
for
space
okay
lets
get
the
record
straight
on
the
livermore
gas
gun
the
project
manager
is
dr
john
hunter
and
he
works
for
the
laser
group
at
livermore
what
you
may
ask
does
gas
guns
have
to
do
with
lasers
nothing
really
but
the
gun
is
physically
located
across
the
road
from
the
free
electron
laser
building
and
the
fel
building
has
a
heavily
shielded
control
room
thick
walls
from
which
the
gun
firings
are
controlled
so
i
suspect
that
the
office
he
works
for
is
an
administrative
convenience
i
visited
hunter
at
the
beginning
of
feb
and
we
toured
the
gun
at
the
time
i
was
working
on
gas
gun
rd
at
boeing
where
i
work
but
i
am
now
doing
other
things
helping
to
save
the
space
station
the
gun
uses
a
methaneair
mixture
which
is
burned
in
a
chamber
about
ft
long
by
inch
id
ie
it
looks
like
a
pipe
the
chamber
holds
a
ton
piston
which
is
propelled
at
several
hundred
ms
down
the
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
piston
is
hudrogen
gas
initially
at
room
temperature
andsome
tens
of
atmospheres
the
piston
compresses
and
heats
the
hydrogen
ahead
of
it
until
a
stainless
steel
burst
diaphragm
ruptures
at
around
psi
the
barrel
of
the
gun
is
about
feet
long
and
has
a
inch
bore
it
is
mounted
at
right
angles
to
the
chamber
ie
they
intersect
this
was
done
so
that
in
the
future
the
barrel
could
be
raised
and
the
gun
fired
into
the
air
without
having
to
move
the
larger
and
heavier
chamber
the
projectile
being
used
in
testing
is
a
kg
cylinder
of
lexan
plastic
in
in
diameter
and
about
cm
long
all
of
the
acceleration
comes
from
the
expansion
of
the
hydrogen
gas
from
psi
downwards
until
the
projectile
leaves
the
barrel
the
barrel
is
evacuated
and
the
end
is
sealed
with
a
sheet
of
plastic
film
a
little
thicker
than
saran
wrap
the
plastic
is
blown
off
by
the
small
amount
of
residual
air
trapped
in
the
barrel
ahead
of
the
projectile
the
gun
is
fired
into
a
bunker
filled
with
sandbags
and
plastic
water
jugs
in
the
early
testing
fragments
of
the
plastic
projectile
were
found
at
the
higher
speeds
in
later
testing
the
projectile
vaporizes
the
testing
is
into
a
bunker
because
the
livermore
test
range
is
about
miles
across
and
the
projectile
would
go
km
if
fired
for
maximum
range
the
intent
is
to
move
the
whole
gun
to
vandenberg
afb
after
the
testing
is
complete
where
they
can
fire
into
the
pacific
ocean
and
use
the
tracking
radar
at
vafb
to
follow
the
projectiles
the
design
goal
of
the
gun
is
to
throw
a
kg
projectile
at
kms
half
of
orbital
speed
so
far
they
have
reached
kms
and
the
gun
is
currently
down
for
repairs
as
on
the
last
test
they
blew
a
seal
and
damaged
some
of
the
hardware
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
the
methaneair
more
detonating
than
burning
but
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
hunter
directly
on
this
there
are
people
waiting
to
test
scramjet
components
in
this
gun
by
firing
then
out
of
the
gun
into
the
air
at
mach
kms
since
the
most
you
can
get
in
wind
tunnels
is
mach
this
gun
cost
about
million
to
develop
and
is
basically
a
proofofconcept
for
a
bigger
gun
capable
of
firing
useful
sized
payloads
into
space
this
would
require
on
the
order
of
kg
projectiles
which
deliver
on
the
order
of
kg
useful
payload
to

let
us

that

this
gives
a

height
of

for

column
a

column
is
not
the

on
how
high
you
can
build
something
if
you
allow
a
tapering
of

as
you
go

let
us
say
you
have
a
pound
load
to
support
at
the
top
of
the
tower
for
simplicity
in
calculation
this
requires
square
inches
of
column
cross
sectional
area
to
support
the
weight
the
mile
of
structure
below
the
payload
will
itself
weigh
lb
so
at
mile
below
the
payload
the
total
load
is
now
lb
a
increase
the
next
mile
of
structure
must
be
thicker
in
cross
section
to
support
the
top
mile
of

plus
the
payload
each
mile
of
structure
must
increase
in
area
by
the

ratio
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
we
can
see
from
this
that
there
is
no
theoretical
limit
on

although
there
will
be
practical
limits
based
on
how
much

we
can
afford
to

at
and
how
much
load
you
need
to
support
on
the
ground
for
which
you
need
a
foundation
that
the
bedrock
can
support
let
us
arbitrarily
choose

in

with
this
we
can
afford
perhaps
lb

assuming
our

then
we

a

ratio

this
is
clearly
above
the
significant
atmosphere
a
rocket
launched
from
the
top
of
the
tower
will
still
have
to
provide
orbital
velocity
but
atmospheric
drag
and
glosses
will
be
almost
eliminated
glosses
are
the
component
of
rocket
thrust
in
the
vertical
direction
to
counter
gravity
but
which
do
not
contribute
to
horizontal
orbital
velocity
thus
they
represent
wasted
thrust
together
with
drag
rockets
starting
from
the
ground
have
a
velocity
penalty
to
contend
with
this
analysis
is
simplified
in
that
it
does
not
consider
wind
loads
these
will
require
more
structural
support
over
the
first
miles
of
height
above
that
the

drops
to
a

preface
it
by
saying
that
i
largely
agree
that
the

age
in
the
romantic
sense
of
several
decades
ago
is

that
projects
like

at

whats
new
the

we

here

its
clear
that
the
romance
of

lies
in
the
ever
more
finegrained
manipulation
of
matter
by
which
i
include
biotechnology
condensed

these

to
a

i

the

some

is
a
matter
of
nostalgia
i
feel
sure
that
someday
we
or
more
precisely
our

children
will
spread
across

unless
we
wipe
ourselves
out

i
think
that

for
any
information
concerning
projects
involving
solar
sails
i
understand
that
the
jpl
did
an
extensive
study
on
the
subject
back
in
the
late
but
i
am
having
trouble
gathering
such

are
there
any

out
there
currently
involved
in
such

i
know
someone
had
long
talks
about
solar
sails
early
this
year
and
late
last
yearalso
about
solar
sailing
not
sure
who
captured
it
if
possible
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
regulars
who
had
most
or
all
the
data
i
think
i
started
the
latest
round
or
the
late
last
year
round
but
the

has
been
around
here

anyone
have

space

in

post
them
here
so
we
all
can
talk
to

and
ask

i
think
the

is
high
so
we
would
have
to
keep

to

such
basically
if
we
want

the

for
both
the
spacecraft
and
otv
arcjets

xenon
thrusters
require
huge
amounts
of
power
so
you
have
to
have
either
nuclear
power
source
messy
dangerous
and
source
of
radiation
damage
or
big
solar
arrays
sensitive
to
radiation
or
heavy
that
make
attitude
control
and
docking
a
big
pain
if
you
go
solar
you
have
to
replace
the
arrays
every
trip
with
current
technology
nuclear
power
sources
are
strongly
restricted
by
international
treaty
refueling
even
for
very
high
isp
like
xenon
is
still
required
and
turn
out
to
be
a
pain
you
either
have
to
develop
autonomous
rendezvous
or
long

teleoperation
to
do
docking
or
and
refueling
you
still
cant
do
much
plane
change

the

required
is

high
the

continues
to
look

this
way

i
suppose
they
are
biding
their
time
till
the
technology
becomes
available
and
the
problems
get
solved
not
impossible
in
principle

hard

do

only
at
the
end

its
beginning
that
space
exploration
is

a

a

is
certainly
debatable
however
technical
developments
in

will
always
be
examined
for
possible
applications
in
the

area
and
we
can
look

their

about

i

and
worked

are
about
the

my

this

i

who

it

i
see

i

there
is
no

it

not

but
in

that
i
have
been
able
to
track
down
it
does
not
also
the
president
of
our
university
who
was
provost
at
university
of
west
virgina
said
that
it
did
not
happen
there
either
and
that
this
figure
must
be
included
in

to
be
a
legitimate

how
do
i
know
i
write
proposals
and
have
won
contracts
and
i
know
to
the
dime
what
the
charges
are
at
uah
for
example
the
overhead
is
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their

rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our

did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in

if
you
have
some
numbers
allen
then
show
them
else
quit
barking
i
did
dennis
read
the
article
to
repeat
an
internal
estimate
done
by
the
reston
costing
department
says
freedom
can
be
built
for
about
a
year
and
operated
for
per
year
if
all
the
money
where
spent
on
freedom
since
we
spend
about
half
a
billion
more
per
year
it
looks
like
roughly
of
the
money
is
wasted
now
if
you
think
im
making
this
up
you
can
confirm
it
in
the
anonymous
editorial
published
a
few
weeks
ago
in
space
news
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an
employee
of
the
overhead
capital
of
nasa
nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
this
dennis
is
why
nasa
has
so
many
problems
you
cant
accept
that
anything
is
wrong
unless
you
can
blame
it
on
congress
oh
sure
youll
say
nasa
has
problems
but
do
you
believe
it
remember
the
wp
overrun
you
insisted
it
was
all
congresses
fault
when
nasa
management
knew
about
the
overrun
for
almost
a
year
yet
refused
to
act
do
you
still
blame
congress
for
the
overrun
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
by
your
own
numbers
allen
at
a
cost
of
million
per
flight
the
service
cost
of
flying
shuttle
to
ssf
is
billion
for
four
flights
so
how
did
you
get
your
one
billion
number
i
have
no
idea
what
your
trying
to
say
here
dennis
allen
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a

if
the

this

i

there
is
no
such
thing
as
wrap
at

i
have
worked
on

written
proposals
worth
tens
of
millions
of
customers
included
government
including
nasa
for
profit
and
nonprofit
companies
all
expected
a
wrap
usually
called
a
fee
much
of
the
work
involved
allocating
and
costing
the
work
of
subcontractors
the
subcontractors
where
universities
forprofits
nonprofits
and
even
some
of
the
nasa
centers
for
the
commercialization
of
space
all
charged
fees
as
part
of
the
work
down
the
street
is
one
of
the
nasa
commercialization
centers
they
charge
a
fee
now
im
sure
your
a
competent
engineer
dennis
but
you
clearly
lack
experience
in
several
areas
your
posts
show
that
you
dont
understand
the
importance
of
integration
in
large
projects
you
also
show
a
lack
of
understanding
of
costing
efforts
as
shown
by
your
belief
that
it
is
reasonable
to
charge
incremental
costs
for
everything
this
isnt
a
flame
jsut
a
statement
your
employer
does
charge
a
fee
you
may
not
see
it
but
you
do
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their
overhead
rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our
president
did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in
the
overhead
well
there
you
are
dennis
as
i
said
they
simply
include
the
fee
in
their
overhead
many
seoparate
the
fee
since
the
fee
structure
can
change
depending
on
the
customer
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an
employee
of
the
overhead
capital
of
nasa
integration
dennis
isnt
overhead
nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
dennis
reston
has
been
the
only
nasa
agency
working
to
reduce
costs
when
wp
was
hemoraging
out
a
billion
the
centers
you
love
so
much
where
doing
their
best
to
cover
it
up
and
ignore
the
problem
reston
was
the
only
place
you
would
find
people
actually
interested
in
solving
the
problems
and
building
a
station
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
when
you
have
a
bit
more
experience
dennis
you
will
realize
that
integration
isnt
overhead
it
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
the
story
you
refer
to
said
that
some
nasa
people
blamed
it
on
congress
suprise
suprise
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
the
centers
you
support
so
much
who
covered
up
the
overheads
and
wouldnt
address
the
problems
until
the
press
published
the
story
are
you
saying
the
reston
managers
where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overruns
you
approve
of
what
the
centers
did
to
cover
up
the
overruns
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a
year
if
the
wrap
were
gone
this
merely
points
out
a
blatent
contridiction
in
your
numbers
that
understandably
you
fail
to
see
you
should
know
dennis
that
nasa
doesnt
include
transport
costs
for
resuply
that
comes
from
the
shuttle
budget
what
they
where
saying
is
that
operational
costs
could
be
cut
in
half
plus
transport

i
do
hope
you
can
find
the
time
to
tell
us
just
why
it
was

to
ask
that

good
for

i
ought
not
to

when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more

if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific
or
commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the

why
not
approach
its
conceivable
that
luna
will
have
a
military
purpose
its
possible
that
luna
will
have
a
commercial
purpose
but
its
most
likely
that
luna
will
only
have
a
scientific
purpose
for
the
next
several
hundred
years
at
least
therefore
lunar
bases
should
be
predicated
on
funding

different

those

the

maneuvering
that
was

was
to
exploit
fuzzy

these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the

perturbations
in

system
the
probe
was
launched
into
this

for
the

system

the
perturbations
affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural
objects
sometimes
get
captured
without
expending

well
just
find
the
trajectory
that
makes
it

the

that

was

are
remotelycontrolled
by
individuals
located

for
edutainment
purposes
not
only
does
this
provide
a
testbed
for
simple
teleoperation
and
telepresence
activities
but
it
also
provides
for
the
sharing
of
information
on
methods
of
operating
in

including
but
not

to
layout
of
a
lunar

and
provides
a

the
biggest
problem
with
this
is
that
all

are
not
alike
it
can
actually
be
more
expensive
to
reach
a
satellite
from
another
orbit
than
from
the
ground
but
with
cheaper
fuel
from
space
based
sources
it
will
be
cheaper
to
reach
more
orbits
than
from
the
ground
also
remember
that
the
presence
of
a

facility
adds
value
to
the

around
it
if
you
can
put
your

in
an

where

by
a

government
including

all
expected
a

usually
called
a

much
of
the
work
involved
allocating

costing
the

of
subcontractors
the
subcontractors
where
universities
forprofits
nonprofits
and
even
some
of

for

all
charged
fees
as
part
of
the
work
down
the
street
is
one
of
the
nasa
commercialization

they
charge
a
fee
you
totally
forgot
the
original
post
that
you
posted
allen
in
that
post
you
stated
that
the
wrap
was
on
top
of
and
in
addition
to
any
overhead
geez
in
this
post
you
finally
admit
that
this
is
not
true
now
im
sure
your
a
competent
engineer
dennis
but
you
clearly
lack
experience
in
several
areas
your
posts
show
that
you
dont
understand
the
importance
of
integration
in
large
projects
you
also
show
a
lack
of
understanding
of
costing
efforts
as
shown
by
your
belief
that
it
is
reasonable
to
charge
incremental
costs
for
everything
this
isnt
a
flame
jsut
a
statement
come
your
little
ol
buns
down
here
and
you
will
find
out
who
is
doing
what
and
who
is
working
on
integration
this
is
simply
an
ad
hominum
attack
and
you
know
it
your
employer
does
charge
a
fee
you
may
not
see
it
but
you
do
of
course
there
is
a
fee
it
is
for
administration
geez
allen
any
organization
has
costs
but
there
is
a
heck
of
a
difference
in
legitimate
costs
such
as
libraries
and
other
things
that
must
be
there
to
support
a
program
and
wrap
as
you
originally
stated
ityou
stated
that
wrap
was
on
top
of
all
of
the
overhead
which
a
couple
of
sentences
down
you
say
is
not
true
which
is
it
allen
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their
overhead
rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our
president
did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in
the
overhead
well
there
you
are
dennis
as
i
said
they
simply
include
the
fee
in
their
overhead
many
seoparate
the
fee
since
the
fee
structure
can
change
depending
on
the
customer
as
you
have
posted
on
this
subject
allen
you
state
that
wrap
is
over
and
above
overhead
and
is
a
seperate
charge
you
admit
here
that
this
is
wrong
nasa
has
a
line
item
budget
every
year
i
have
seen
it
allen
get
some
numbers
from
that
detailed
nasa
budget
and
dig
out
the
wrap
numbers
and
then
howl
to
high
heaven
about
it
until
you
do
that
you
are
barking
in
the
wind
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an
employee
of
the
overhead
capital
of
nasa
integration
dennis
isnt
overhead
nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
integration
could
be
done
better
at
the
centers
apollo
integration
was
done
here
at
msfc
and
that
did
not
turn
out
so
bad
the
philosophy
of
reston
is
totally
wrong
allen
there
you
have
a
bunch
of
people
who
are
completely
removed
from
the
work
that
they
are
trying
to
oversee
there
is
no
way
that
will
ever
work
it
has
never
worked
in
any
large
scale
project
that
it
was
ever
tried
on
could
you
imagine
a
reston
like
set
up
for
apollo
dennis
reston
has
been
the
only
nasa
agency
working
to
reduce
costs
when
wp
was
hemoraging
out
a
billion
the
centers
you
love
so
much
where
doing
their
best
to
cover
it
up
and
ignore
the
problem
reston
was
the
only
place
you
would
find
people
actually
interested
in
solving
the
problems
and
building
a
station
oh
you
are
full
of
it
allen
on
this
one
i
agree
that
jsc
screwed
up
big
they
should
be
responsible
for
that
screw
up
and
the
people
that
caused
it
replaced
to
make
a
stupid
statement
like
that
just
shows
how
deep
your
bias
goes
come
to
msfc
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
you
will
find
out
just
how
wrong
you
really
are
maybe
not
people
like
you
believe
exactly
what
they
want
to
believe
no
matter
what
the
facts
are
contrary
to
it
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
when
you
have
a
bit
more
experience
dennis
you
will
realize
that
integration
isnt
overhead
it
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
i
agree
that
integration
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
what
i
completly
disagree
with
is
seperating
that
integration
function
from
the
people
that
are
doing
the
work
it
is
called
leadership
allen
that
is
what
made
apollo
work
final
responsibility
for
the
success
of
apollo
was
held
by
less
than
people
that
is
leadership
and
responsibility
there
is
neither
when
you
have
any
organization
set
up
as
reston
is
you
could
take
the
same
people
and
move
them
to
jsc
or
msfc
and
they
could
do
a
much
better
job
why
did
it
take
a
year
for
reston
to
finally
say
something
about
the
problem
if
they
were
on
site
and
part
of
the
process
then
the
problem
would
have
never
gotten
out
of
hand
in
the
first
place
there
is
one
heck
of
a
lot
i
do
not
know
allen
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
for
a
project
to
be
successful
you
must
have
leadership
i
remember
all
of
the
turn
over
at
reston
that
kept
ssf
program
in
shambles
for
years
do
you
it
is
lack
of
responsibility
and
leadership
that
is
the
programs
problem
lack
of
leadership
from
the
white
house
congress
and
at
reston
nasa
is
only
a
symptom
of
a
greater
national
problem
you
are
so
narrowly
focused
in
your
efforts
that
you
do
not
see
this
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
the
story
you
refer
to
said
that
some
nasa
people
blamed
it
on
congress
suprise
suprise
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
the
centers
you
support
so
much
who
covered
up
the
overheads
and
wouldnt
address
the
problems
until
the
press
published
the
story
are
you
saying
the
reston
managers
where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overruns
you
approve
of
what
the
centers
did
to
cover
up
the
overruns
no
i
am
saying
that
if
they
were
located
at
jsc
it
never
would
have
happened
in
the
first
place
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a
year
if
the
wrap
were
gone
this
merely
points
out
a
blatent
contridiction
in
your
numbers
that
understandably
you
fail
to
see
you
should
know
dennis
that
nasa
doesnt
include
transport
costs
for
resuply
that
comes
from
the
shuttle
budget
what
they
where
saying
is
that
operational
costs
could
be
cut
in
half
plus
transport
sorry
gang
but
i
have
a
deadline
for
a
satellite
so
someone
else
is
going
to
have
to
do
allens
math
for
him
for
a
while
i
will
have
little
chance
to
do
so
i
do
hope
you
can
find
the
time
to
tell
us
just
why
it
was
wrong
of
reston
to
ask
that
the
problems
with
wp
be
addressed
i
have
the
time
to
reitereate
one
more
timet
that
if
the
leadership
that
is
at
reston
was
on
site
at
jsc
the
problem
never
would
have
happened
totally
ignoring
the
lack
of
leadership
of
congress
this
many
headed
hydra
that
has
grown
up
at
nasa
is
the
true
problem
of
the
agency
and
to
try
to
change
the
question
to
suit
you

i

youre

in

that
with
a

economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo

real
lunar

will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific

commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the

why
not
approach
ah
but
the
whole
point
is
that
money
spent
on
a
lunar
base
is
not
wasted
on
the
moon
its
not
like
theyd
be
using
bills
to
fuel
their
moondozers
the
money
to
fund
a
lunar
base
would
be
spent
in
the
country
to
which
the
base
belonged
its
a
way
of
funding
hightech
research
just
like
darpa
was
a
good
excuse
to
fund
various
fields
of
research
under
the
pretense
that
it
was
crucial
to
the
defense
of
the
country
or
like
esprit
is
a
good
excuse
for
the
ec
to
fund
research
under
the
pretense
that
its
good
for
paneuropean
cooperation
now
maybe
you
think
that
governmentfunded
research
is
a
waste
of
money
in
fact
im
pretty
sure
you
do
but
it
does
count

they
just

ok
if

no
before
liftoff
ignore
it
good
grief
and
i
thought
the
shuttle
software
was
known
for
being
wellengineered
if
this
is
actually
the
case
every
member
of
the
programming
team
should
be
taken
out

shot
given
that
ive
heard
the

rated
as
level

i
strongly

that
this

does

for

well
first
you
work
out
how

cold

you
need
then
make
the
tanks
big
enough
our
sounding
rocket
payload
with
telemetry
guidance
etc
etc
and
a
telescope
cluster
weighs
around
pounds
it
uses
freon
jets
for
steering
and
a
pulsewidthmodulated
controller
for
alignment
ie
during
our
eight
minutes
in
space
the
jets
are
pretty
much
continuously
firing
on
a
duty
cycle
or
so
the
jets
also
need
to
kill
residual
angular
momentum
from
the
spin
stabilization
and
flip
the
payload
around
to
look
at
the
sun
we
have
two
freon
tanks
each
holding
liters
of
freon
im
speaking
only
from
memory
of
the
last
flight
the
ground
crew
at
wsmr
choose
how
much
freon
to
use
based
on
some
blackmagic
algorithm
they
have
extra
tank
modules
that
just
bolt
into
the

this
should
give
you
an
idea
of
the
order
of

cold

quantity
if
you

a

happy
happy

joy

if
you

the

put

if
some

went

you
could
send
a

more
either
way
its
a

more

this

billion

i
think
if
there
is
to

a
prize
and
such
there
should
be
classes
such
as
the
following
large
corp
small
corpcompany
based
on
reported

large
government
gnp
and
such
small
governemtn
or
political
clout
or
gnp
large
organization
planetary
society
and
such
small
organization
alot
of
small
orgs
the
organization
things
would
probably
have
to
be
nonprofit
or
liek
of
course
this
means
the
prize
might
go
up
larger
get
more
or
basically
make
the
prize
total
purse
billion
divided
amngst
the
class
winners
more
fair
there
would
have
to
be
a

set

this
is
turning
into
whats
a
moonbase
good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific
or
commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
why
not
approach
i
was
assuming
that
there
wont
be
a
moon
base
unless
it
makes
a
profit
actually
if
it
does
well
that
gives
a
larger
gnp
which
leads
to
being
able
to
spend
more
money
on
your
military
including
goshwow
space
stuff
assuming
its
profitable
rather
than
paying
for
itself
its
conceivable
that
luna
will
have
a
military
purpose
its
possible
that
luna
will
have
a
commercial
purpose
but
its
most
likely
that
luna
will
only
have
a
scientific
purpose
for
the
next
several
hundred
years
at
least
therefore
lunar
bases
should
be
predicated
on
funding
levels
little
different
from
those
found
for
antarctic
bases
can
you
put
a
person
base
on
the
moon
for
million
a
year
even
if
you
use
grad
students
you
might
be
able
to
run
one
for
that
put
it
there
hardly
why
do
you
think
at

a

with
zero
fuel
consumption
however
it
is
more
difficult
to
design
a
practical
solar
sail
than
most
people
realize
the
pressure
of
sunlight
is
only
about
one
kilogram
per
square
kilometer
deploying
and
controlling
the
large
area
of
aluminized
fabric
which
would
be
necessary
to
transport
a
conventional
type
spacecraft
is
a
daunting
task
this
is
why
despite
the
potential
of
hte
idea
no
such
craft
has
actually
been
launched
to
date
recent
advances
in
microelectronics
make
possible
a
different
concept
a
tiny
sail
just
a
few
metres
in
diameter
which
could
be
controlled
purely
be
electronics
with
no
mechanical
parts
several
attitude
control
methods
are
feasible
for
example
the
pressure
sunlight
exerts
on
a
panel
of
solar
cells
varies
according
to
whether
power
is
being
drawn
the
key
components
of
the
craft
will
be
a
minute
ccd
camera
developed
at
edinburgh
university
which
can
act
as
both
attitude
sensor
and
data
gathering
device
solar
cells
providing
watt
power
for
control
and
communication
and
a
directional
radio
antenna
etched
onto
the
surface
of
the
sail
itself
launched
as
a
piggyback
payload
the
total
cost
of
the
mission
can
be
limited
to
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
the
craft
would
be
capable
of
some
ambitious
missions
for
example
a
it
could
rendezvous
with
a
nearby
asteroid
from
the
apollo
or
amor
groups
closeup
pictures
could
be
transmitted
back
to
earth
at
a
low
bit
rate
b
it
could
be
steered
into
a
lunar
polar
orbit
previously
unobserved
areas
around
the
lunar
poles
could
be
viewed
by
angling
the
sail
to
reflect
sunlight
downwards
polar
craters
whose
bases
never
receive
sunlight
could
be
imaged
bright
reflections
would
confirm
that
volatiles
such
as
water
ice
have
become
trapped
in
these
locationsimmensely
valuable
information
for
setting
up
a
manned
lunar
base
btw
c
it
could
be
sent
to
rendezvous
with
a
small
asteroid
or
comet
nucleus
impacting
at
low
speed
a
thin
wire
probe
attached
to
the
craft
causes
it
to
rebound
while
capturing
a
tiny
sample
is
a
sharpedged
tube
like
performing
a
biopsy
returning
to
earth
the
sail
acts
as
an
ideal
reentry
parachute
load
per
unit
area

that
heat
is
reradiated
so
efectively
that

wishful

its

that

never

as
far
as
we

we

right
here
on

or
from

aside
from
the
semimythic
that
might
be
useful
in
low

exploring
it
would
satisfy
a
curiosity
itch
and
its
position
in
the
gravity
well
of
earth
coupled
with
its
heat
sink
capacity
could
offer
some
military
utility
for
high

military

but
it
holds
very
minute
commercial
value
if
space
travel
becomes
cheap
enough
it
might
become
a

as
mt

and
the

have
become
but
thats
a
very
minor

field
its

its

luna
has
a
modest
vacuum
and
raw
solar
exposure
two
weeks
a
month
but
orbital

can
have
better
vacuums
and
continous
solar

luna
offers
a
source
of
light
element
rocks
that
can
serve
as
raw

heatsink
and
shielding
the
asteroids
and
comets
offer
sources
of
both
light

heavy
elements
and
volatile
compounds
and
many
are
in
less
steep
gravity
wells
so
that
less

them
we

because
we

keeping
spacecraft
on
after
funding
cuts
why
do
spacecraft
have
to
be
shut
off
after
funding
cuts
for
example
why
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bobbing
about
venus
in
a
lowpoweruse
mode
and
if
maybe
in
a
few
years
if
funding
gets
restored
after
the
economy
gets
better
hopefully
it
could
be
turned
on
again
for
that
matter
why
exactly
were
the
apollo
lunar
experiments
turned
off
rather
than
just
safed
was
it
political
ie
as
along
as
they
could
be
used
someone
would
keep
bugging
congress
for
funds
turning
them
off
keeps
them
pesky
scientists
out
of
the
bureaucrats
hair
ive
heard
the
argument
that
an
active
but
uncontrolled
spacecraft
causes
radio
noise
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
that
this
could
be
a
problem
in
a
properly
designed
safe
mode
this
safe
mode
could
be
a
program
routine
which
causes
the
spacecraft
to
go
to
least
fuel
using
orientation
and
once
a
week
month
year
whatever
attempts
a
signal
lock
on
earth
at
that
time
if
funding
has
been
restored
the
mission
can
continue
if
no
signal
is
recieved
the
spacecraft
goes
back
to
the
safe
mode
for
another
time
period
as
we
would
know
when
the
spacecraft
is
going
to
try
to
contact
earth
we
could
be
prepared
if
necessary
as
another
a
spacecraft
could
do
at
the
attempted
contact
is
beam
stored
data
towards
earth
if
someone
can
receive
it
great
if
not
so
its
lost
and
no
big
deal
by
making
the
time
and
signal
location
generally
known
perhaps
someone
in
the
world
might
be
able
and
willing
to
intercept
the
data
even
if
theyre
not
willing
to
contact
the
spacecraft
i
see
this
as
being
particularly
useful
for
spacecraft
which
could
have
an
otherwise
long
life
and
are
in
or
are
going
to
places
which
are
otherwise
unaccessible
jupitersaturn
orbit
exiting
the
solar
system
etc
perhaps
those
designing
future
spacecraft
cassini
pluto
flyby
etc
should
consider
designing
in
a
pause
mode
in
case
their
spacecraft
gets
the
ax
sometime
in
the
future
after
completion
of
the
primary
mission
perhaps
mars
observer
and
galilleo
could
have
some
kind
of
routine
written
in
for
the
post
mission
drift
phase
so
any
holes
in
all
this

as
far
as
we

it
has

we
cant

here
on
earth
or
from
asteroids
and
comets
aside
from
the
semimythic
that
might
be
useful
in
low
grade
fusion
reactors
i
dont
know
what
a
low
grade
fusion
reactor
is
but
the
major
problem
with
aside
from
the
difficulty
in
making
any
fusion
reactor
work
is
that
its
concentration
in
lunar
regolith
is
just
so
small
on
the
order
of
ppb
or
so
on
average
more
in
some
fractions
but
still
very
small
massive
amounts
of
regolith
would
have
to
be
processed
this
thread
reminds
me
of
wingos
claims
some
time
ago
about
the
moon
as
a
source
of
titanium
for
use
on
earth
as
i
recall
wingo
wasnt
content
with
being
assured
that
titanium
at
in
the
earths
crust
average
would
not
run
out
and
touted
lunar
mines
even
though
the
market
price
of
ilmenite
concentrate
these
days
is
around
this
prompted
me
to
look
up
large
potential
terrestrial
sources
on
the
moon
titanium
occurs
in
basalts
highti
basalts
apollo
and
have
titanium
dioxide
by
weight
this
is
nice
but
terrestrial
continental
flood
basalts
are
also
typically
enriched
in
titanium
they
very
often
have
frequently
have
and
sometimes
even
again
by
weight
these
flood
basalts
are
enormous
millions
of
cubic
kilometers
scattered
all
over
the
world
siberia
brazil
the
nw
united
states
ethiopia
etc
if
even
of
the
basalts
are
this
is
trillions
of
tons
of
at
concentrations
only
a
factor
of
less
than
in
lunar
highti
basalts
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
disadvantages
of
the
moon
could
be
overcome
by
such
a
small
increase
the
concentration
of
the
ore
never
mind
the
richer
but
less
common
terrestrial
ores
being
mined
today

talk
about
a
commercial
space
race
ie
to
the
first

base
is
intriguing
similar
prizes
have
influenced
aerospace
development
before
the
orteig
prize
helped
lindbergh
sell
his
spirit
of
saint
louis
venture
to
his
financial
backers
but
i
strongly
suspect
that
his
saint
louis
backers
had
the
foresight
to
realize
that
much
more
was
at
stake
than
could
it
work
with
the
moon
who
are
the
farsighted
financial
backers
of
today
the
commercial
uses
of
a
transportation
system
between
alreadysettled
andcivilized
areas
are
obvious
spaceflight
is
not
in
this
position
the
correct
analogy
is
not
with
aviation
of
the
but
the
long
transocean
voyages
of
the
age
of
discovery
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
i
am
sure
that
a
thriving
spaceflight
industry
will
eventually
develop
and
large
numbers
of
people
will
live
and
work
offearth
but
if
you
ask
me
for
specific
justifications
other
than
the
increased
resource
base
i
cant
give
them
we
just
dont
know
enough
the
launch
rate
demanded
by
existing
space
industries
is
just
too
low
to
bring
costs
down
much
and
we
are
very
much
in
the
dark
about
what
the
revolutionary
new
space
industries
will
be

on

this
sounds
like
something
lowell

would

does
anyone
know

nasa

however
since
nasa
bases
its

on

flawed

estimates
wn
mar
the

would
bear
most
of

this
may
look
like
environmental

but
mike
lawson
ceo

told
us
yesterday
that
the
real

is
to

the

the

he

is
just

this
may
be
the
purpose
for
the

people
my
guess
is
that
the
purpose
for
the
livermore
people
is
to
learn
how
to

what
do
you

it

not

anymore
if
this
is

i
think
its
a
great
idea
learning
how
to
build
to
build
structures
in

in
an
essential
step
towards
space
development
and
given
that
freedom
appears
to
be
shrinking
towards
the
vanishing
point
i
question
whether
nasas
space
station
is
going
to
provide
much
if
any
knowledge
in
this
area
especially
if
a
design
such
as

is
chosen
if
such
a

also
monitors
ozone

and
demonstrates
creative

so
much

about

a
general
dynamics
scheme
involving
a

iv

to

upper

lev
and
crew
capsule
the
mission
consists
of
delivering
two
unmanned

to
the
lunar

followed
by
a
manned

total
cost
us
was
billion
joint
esanasa
project
was

for

us
share
i
didnt
find
a
mention
of
how
long
the
crew
could
stay
but
id
bet
that
its
around
days
and
the
total
payload
delivered
was
about
metric
tonnes
so
if
you
ignore
the
scientific
payload
hitch
a
ride
in
the
crew
habitation
module
no
return
trip
and
toss
in
a
few
more
tonnes
for
the
additional
consumables
to
last
another
months
then
you
might
be
able
to
get
a
year
visit
out
of
tonnes
and
in
case
its
not
obvious
thats
a
wild
ass
guess
a
pretty
boring
visit
since
every
trip
outdoors
eats
up
a
bit
of
lox
and
im
not
certain
if
a
home
brewed
or
collegebrewed
life
support
system
could
last
a
year
but
lets
round
this
up
to
tonnes
convient
since
the
gd
plan
talks
about
ton
payloads
delivered
to
the
lunar
surface
this
adds
up
to
two
centaurs
two
levs
two
shuttle
flights
all
to
put
a
single
man
on
the
moon
for
a
year
hmmm
not

practical
anyone
got
a

way
of
delivering
tonnes
to

surface
within

decade
anyone
have
a

precise
guess
about
how
much
a
years
supply
of
consumables
and
equipment
would
weigh
and
i
was
wondering
about
the
gd
lev
is
it
reusable
or
is
it
discarded
to
burn
up
on

to

if
its
not
discarded
could

be

henry
do
you

i

it

im

the

goalprize
of

is

how
about
a
prize
for
the
first
nongovernment
sponsered
unmanned

landing
then
another
for
a

moon
landing
then
yet
another
for
a

to

another
for
a
reusable
earthmoon
shuttle
and
so
forth
find
some
way
to

infrastructure
having

might

the

to

thermal

into

to

you

id

jay
and
again
please
try
to
encourage
anyone
that
can
observe
the
iapetus
planet
disappearance
to
do
so
at
thermal
wavelengths
my
impression
would
be
that
its
not
an
easy
observation
iapetus
will
be
faint
and
getting
fainter
in
eclipse
so
youll
need
a
big
telescope
thats
a
good
ir
telescope
and
reasonable
um
instrumentation
i
dont
think
that
combination
is
widely
available
at
the
longitudes
that
are
well
placed
for
observation
we
need
sofia
for
this

one
possibility
would
be

if

hopefully
it

it
can
be

the
problem
is
a
political
one
not

technical
one
also
remember
that
every
dollar
spent
keeping
one
spacecraft
in

probably
a
spinstabilized

is
a
dollar
not
spent
on
mission
analysis
for
a
newer
spacecraft
in
order
to
turn
the
spacecraft
back
on
you
either
need
to
insure
that
the
ops
guys
will
be
available
or
you
need
to
retrain
a
new
team
having
said
that
there
are
some
spacecraft
that
do
what
you
have
proposed
many
of
the
operational
satellites
goddard
flies
like
the
tiros
noaa
series
require
more
than
one
satellite
in
orbit
for
an
operational
set
extras
which
get
replaced
onorbit
are
powered
into
a
standby
mode
for
use
in
an
emergency
in
that
case
however
the
same
ops
team
is
still
required
to
fly
the
operational
birds
so
the
standby
maintenance
is
relatively
cheap
finally
pats
explanation
some
spacecraft
require
continuous
maintenance
to
stay
under
control
is
also
right
on
the
mark
i
suggested
a
spin
stabilized
control
mode
because
it
would
require
little
power
or
maintenance
but
it
still
might
require
some
momentum
dumping
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
it
is
a
political
decision
since
the
difference
is
money
but
there
is
some
technical
rationale
behind
the

this

the

the

to

the

harsh

of

it
is
also
closer

m
in

youve
hit
on
the
real
kicker
however
the
centaur
is
pressure
stabilized
it
cannot
hold
up
its
own
weight
without
pressure
in
the
tanks
additionally
the
pressure
difference
between
the
two
tanks
must
be
maintained
to
psi
that
is
rather
tight
to
be
rocking
and
rolling
on

train
the
pressure
stabilization
is
how
centaur
achieves
the
performance
on
numerous
occasions
when
i
was
there
the
af
wanted
to
see
what
it
would
take
to
make
a
nonpressure
stabilized
centaur
the
answer
a
centaur
not
worth
launching
the
atlascentaur
does
not
require
onpad
integration
however
the
does
i
believe
the
onpad
integration
is
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
cleanliness
requirements
and
pfl
configuration
so
maybe
something
can
be
done
there
they
would
also
need

lh

in

you

the
addition
of
loxlh
facilities
is
critical
as
the
centaur
tops
off
as
it
lifts
off
a
lhe
facility
is
also
needed
i
dont
know
what
the
proton
uses
for
fuel
but
since
they
are
derived
from
icbms
i
would
suspect
that
they
use
storable
propellants

dont

that

do

for
saying
they
are
up

also
my

could

so
i
only
caught
the
end
of
the

so
all
the
information
on
the
topic
is
not
known
to
me
at

the

is
of
a

outside

found
in

supposably
recently
acording

it
was
meant
to
be
about

and
a
faily
large
distance
from
the
plutos
orbit
it
had
a
computer
drawing
and
the
orbit
distance
from
pluto
was
about
the
same
as
neptune
to
pluto
when
they
are
furthest

this
is
all
i
found
out
about

all

the

obvious
spaceflight
is
not
in
this
position
the
correct
analogy
is
not
with
aviation
of
the
but
the
long
transocean
voyages
of
the
age
of
discovery
lindberghs
flight
took
place
in
not
the
thirties
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
could
you
give
examples
of
privately
funded
ones
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
your
logic
certainly
applies
to
standard
investment
strategies
however
the
concept
of
a
prize
for
a
difficult
goal
is
done
for
different
reasons
i
suspect
im
not
aware
that
mr
orteig
received
any
significant
economic
benefit
from
lindberghs
flight
modern
analogies
such
as
the
prize
for
a
human
powered
helicopter
face
similar
arguments
there
is
little
economic
benefit
in
such
a
thing
the
advantage
comes
in
the
new
approaches
developed
and
the
fact
that
a
prize
will
frequently
generate
far
more
work
than
the
equivalent
amount
of
direct
investment
would
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it
done

surviving
large
accelerations
hi
i
was
reading
through
the
spaceflight
handbook
and
somewhere
in
there
the
author
discusses
solar
sails
and
the
forces
acting
on
them
when
and
if
they
try
to
gain
an
initial
acceleration
by
passing
close
to
the
sun
in
a
hyperbolic
orbit
the
magnitude
of
such
accelerations
he
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
he
also
says
that
this
is
may
not
be
a
big
problem
for
manned
craft
because
humans
and
this
was
published
in
have
already
withstood
accelerations
of
all
this
is
very
longwinded
but
heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
can
this
be
extended
to
larger
accelerations

basically
get
the
ecifreaks
to
make
it
so
hard
to
get
the
minerals
on

you
think
this
is
crazy
well
in
a
way
it
is
but
in
a
way
it
is
reality
there
is
a
billin
the
congress
to
do
just
that
basically
to
make
it
so
expensive
to
mine
minerals
in
the
us
unless
you
can
by
off
the
inspectors
or
tax
collectors
ascially
what
i
understand
from
talking
to
a
few
miner
friends
of
mine
that
they
the
congress
propose
to
have
a
tax
on
the
gross
income
of
the
mine
versus
the
adjusted
income
also
the
state
governments
have
there
normal
taxes
so
by
the
time
you
get
done
paying
for
materials
workers
and
other
expenses
you
can
owe
more
than
what
you
made
basically
if
you
make
a
and
spend
ofor
expenses
you
can
owe
in
federal
taxes
bascially
it
is
driving
the
miners
off
the
land
and
the
only
peopel
who
benefit
are
the
ecofreaks
basically
to
get
back
to
my
beginning
statement
is
space
is
the
way
to
go
cause
it
might
just
get
to
expensive
to
mine
on
earth
because
of
either
the
ecofreaks
or
the

simple
as

you

most

reminded

principle
undoubtably

built

transportation

ended
the

it
took
the

here
today

a
few
years
to
show
through
the

initiative
that
the
cold

must
end

you

us
launched

the

this

what
a

opportunity
to
cause

for

this

i
would
sincerely
like
to

my

today
is

rocket
technology
rocket
or
ssrt
by
i
intend
to
speak
of
more
how
to
lower
the
cost
and
make
rapid
progress
ssrt
is
to
my
mind
and
i
hope
to
convince
you
the
erupting
a
new
rallying
cry
for
our
generation
in
space
faster
cheaper
and
better
faster
cheaper
better
and
ssrt
represent
the
passing
of
a
torch
from
one
technical
generation
to
another
it
is
a
new
thing
to
be
sure
but
it
is
also
a
relearning
of
old
things
from
past
masters
when
we
rolled
out
the
ssrt
baby
two
weeks
ago
so
called
experts
told
us
it
violates
the
laws
of
physics
it
made
no
sense
for
example
dr
eberhart
rachtin
former
president
of
the
aerospace
corp
said
of
ssrt
in
the
la
times
that
it
defies
the
best
principles
of
launching
payloads
into
space
well
dr
rachtin
youve
made
us
mad
what
are
these
principles
that
ssrt
defies
well
ill
tell
you
it
violates
the
principle
that
you
need
a
giant
program
office
to
build
space
hardware
it
violates
the
fact
that
it
takes
years
to
build
something
new
and
it
violates
the
truism
that
you
cant
do
anything
significant
for
less
than
many
billions
of
dollars
it
took
some
of
the
last
generations
experts
to
teach
us
some
newold
lessons
werhner
von
brauns
first
rocket
was
not
a
saturn
v
general
schrievers
icbms
didnt
take
ten
years
to
demonstrate
and
the
airplane
didnt
cost
billion
it
took
one
of
the
great
engineers
of
the
to
remind
us
of
these
truths
max
hunter
max
to
remind
you
was

in

program
and
old
faster
better
cheaper
success
story
max
has
been
persistent
in
a
vision
of
a
single
stage
reusable
space
launch
system
since
the
because
he
knew
it
had
to
be
done
in
affordable
steps
build
a
little
test
a
little
next
he
persuaded
us
to
do
a
technology
demonstration
we
didnt
solicit
a
bunch
of
requirements
theyd
just
change
every
few
years
anyway
not
included
in
the
speech
the
alsnls
has
such
ephemeral
requirements
that
it
would
better
known
as
shape
shifter
than
space
lifter
we
didnt
spend
a
lot
money
this
xrocket
only
cost
million
whens
the
last
time
we
even
built
a
new
airplane
for
that
and
it
didnt
take
a
lot
of
time
to
build
mcdonnell
douglas
completed
it
in
months
finally
the
government
program
office
consisted
of
one
very
overworked
air
force
major
motivated
in
part
by
the
threat
that
hed
get
to
ride
on
it
in
a
strappedon
lawn
chair
if
it
ran
over
cost
or
schedule
as
i
described
what
ssrt
is
and
isnt
keep
in
mind
its
only
a
first
step
there
are
several
more
steps
and
steps
that
can
easily
fail
before
the
us
can
field
an
ssto
but
each
step
should
follow
the
same
principles
a
small
management
team
a
few
years
technology
demonstration
and
a
modest
budget
let
me
show
a
few
details
on
ssrt
and
how
it
might
evolve
see
charts
im
embarrassed
when
my
generation
is
compared
with
the
last
generation
the
giants
of
the
last
great
space
era
the
and
they
went
to
the
moon
we
built
a
telescope
that
cant
see
straight
they
softlanded
on
mars
the
least
we
could
do
is
softland
on
earth
but
we
do
have
an
answer
we
can
follow
their
build
a
little
test
a
little
philosophy
to
produce
a
truly
affordable
and
routine
access
to
space
i
know
there
are
nay
sayers
among
you
those
who
say
ssrt
is
a
stunt
it
needs
more
thermal
protection
the
engines
are
wrong
it
would
be
better
to
land
horizontally
etc
etc
i
say
to
you
well
see
you

in

you
bring

we

we
can
do

you

could

totally

record
me
thinking

learn
to

what
i
got

concluding

my

the

that

who
move

would
try

temporarily
locally
reverse

which
id
start
looking

why
not
perhaps
by
passing
a

through
a
two

or
something
and
seeing
what

next

im
curios

dont

we

and
then

warning
about
writing
to
the
past
i
had
a
little
dream
of
being
in
a
world
in
the
near
parallel
future
lying
along
a
path
of
history
which
we
have
diverged
from
there
were
twelve
telepathic
glowing
beings
who
looked
like
an
oscar
award
and
who
had
always
been
a
dark
one
who
looked
like
us
and
then
myself
the
dark
one
was
in
the
process
of
making
the
others
into
gods
he
had
to
teach
them
what
that
meant
by
advising
them
in
their
past
basically
he
manipulated
them
into
reproducing
and
raising
their
children
on
his
seed
he
said
that
the
little
ones
who
looked
different
were
a
subspecies
meant
to
provide
service
he
carefully
combed
through
history
rewriting
it
in
his
favor
pulling
like
a
weed
anything
that
compromised
his
control
he
enticed
recruits
by
sending
them
his
visions
saying
that
there
was
immortality
at
the
end
of
the
road
for
only
twelve
souls
kill
or
be
killed
the
amount
of
control
he
could
exert
was
finite
though
as
at
every
change
he
made
a
void
would
appear
in
our
reality
the
universe
one
day
ended
meters
from
us
it
seemed
odd
but
we
couldnt
remember
how
else
it
should
be
then
some
of
the
twelve
were
no
more
finally
when
he
could
prune
no
more
and
reality
stopped
just
beyond
his
fingertips
he
stepped
through
his
portal
to
the
past
to
bask
over
and
over
in
all
that
he
had
created
i
made
a
few
more
changes
and
lost
my
body
existing
only
on
the
wind
moral
its
very
possible
to
eliminate
from
your
reality
the
souls
whose
wills
are
not
in
harmony
with
yours
golden
rule
treat
others
as
you
wish
to
be
treated
ie
you
could
end
up
along
a
lonely
thread
of
time
with
murderers
or
flowery
brownnosers
for
playmates
its
not
eternal
theres
more
than
one
way
back
accepting
rides
to
the
past
once
here
the
one
who
looks
like
us
sells
rides
he
can
make
you
a
prince
or
a
queen
or
you
can
live
as
a
god
in
ancient
greece
go
ahead
repeat
the
third
grade
as
often
as
you
like
adam
henry
i
hope
you
like
inspecting
your
socks
careful
though
if
he
likes
your
work
but
thinks
youre
getting
wise
he
can
direct
you
to
cross
paths
with
your
old
self
and
youll
vanish
as
you
rewrite
your
own
course
of
history
none
the
wiser
as
we
pass
the
point
along
the
parallel
line
where
he
stepped
back
in
time
his
hierarchy
will
lose
its
direction
he
can
still
make
changes
while
hes
here
its
just
that
that
is
work
and
with
every
adjustment
this
becomes
less
the
world
he
cultivated
which
loosens
his
grip
and
his
organization
is
suddenly
one
branch
less
but
he
cant
see
the
change
the
basic
nature
of
man
is
good
he
had
to
apply
his
hand
to
achieve
his
world
as
he
now
tightens
his

to
retain

built

i
shouted
to

said
no

he
defined

problem
could
be
that
all

indigenous

who
have
no

vanishing

of
the

as
a
transceiver
if
it
is
on

ground
and
pointed
up
you
can
locate
it
from
above
these
people
are
probably
naive
as
children
but
very
very
tough
to
kill
also
they
should
be
able
to
tell
you
stories
about
the
dark
one
that
i
talk
about
they
can
hear
him
i
think
that
ham
and
world
band
radio
old
timers
might
have
a

to
tell
on
this
these
people
would
be
on

us
as
they
arent

i
make

almost

i
get

get

when

i
get

a

need

keeping

its

make

what
is

is

but
some

that
they
suck
on

is
not
so

that
their

is

it
is
that
they
arent

think
that
there
may
be
some
very

to

such
as

there

of
this

in

kingdom
to
investigate
that

is
the
master
of
illusion
and
the
ultimate
liar
he
tells
it
first
and
then
just
follows
the
thread
of
time
in
which
the
people
are
willing
to
buy
it
in
which
he
can
make
it
so
hell
play
a
poker
face
up
until
he
thinks
hes
cornered
and
then
hell
whine
beg

all
it
means
to
him
is
that
youre
willing
to
live
on
the
ground
work
that
he
has
laid
that
is
that
he
was
right
and
he
didnt
over
play
his

and
he
wont
need
to
go
back
and
try
another
thread
of
time
you
have
ultimate
control
over
your
destiny
just
dont
live
along
a
path
that
leads
to
a
reality
in
which
you
dont
want
to
be
a
part
of
i
dont
claim
to
be
the
first
to
think
these
things
its
just
that
the
others
could
have
been
pruned
from
our
path
maybe
these
thoughts
given
to
me
were
laid
down
on
the
track
of

after
him
subject
re

mining
in

nsmcaauroraalaskaedu

here
is
a
way
to
get
the
commericial
companies
into
space
and
mineral
exploration
basically
get
the
ecifreaks
to
make
it
so
hard
to
get
the
minerals
on
earth
you
think
this
is
crazy
well
in
a
way
it
is
but
in
a
way
it
is
reality
there
is
a
billin
the
congress
to
do
just
that
basically
to
make
it
so
expensive
to
mine
minerals
in
the
us
unless
you
can
by
off
the
inspectors
or
tax
collectors
ascially
what
i
understand
from
talking
to
a
few
miner
friends
of
mine
that
they
the
congress
propose
to
have
a
tax
on
the
gross
income
of
the
mine
versus
the
adjusted
income
also
the
state
governments
have
there
normal
taxes
so
by
the
time
you
get
done
paying
for
materials
workers
and
other
expenses
you
can
owe
more
than
what
you
made
basically
if
you
make
a
and
spend
ofor
expenses
you
can
owe
in
federal
taxes
bascially
it
is
driving
the
miners
off
the
land
and
the
only
peopel
who
benefit
are
the
ecofreaks
basically
to
get
back
to
my
beginning
statement
is
space
is
the
way
to
go
cause
it
might
just
get
to
expensive
to
mine
on
earth
because
of
either
the
ecofreaks
or
the
protectionist
such
fun
we
have
in
these
interesting
times
michael
adams
im
not
high
just
jacked
the
current
mining
regulations
and
fees
were
set
in
the
what
the
socalled
ecofreaks
want
to
do
is
to
simply
bring
those
fees
in
line
with
current
economic
reality
currently
mining
companies
can
get
access
to
minerals
on
public
lands
for
ridiculously
low
prices
something
like
the
mining
lobby
has
for
decades
managed
to
block
any
reform
of
these
outdated
fees
in
fact
the
latest
attempt
to
reform
them
was
again
blocked
president
clinton
compromised
by
taking
the
mining
fee
reforms
out
of
his
budget
and
plans
to
draft
separate
legislation
to
fight
that
battle
if
you

the
important
thing
to
realize
here
is
that
the
big
cost

is
getting
into

earth
orbit
everything
else
is
practically
down
in

the
only
part

to
the

that
poses
any

problems
beyond
what
you

the

that

you

be
a

than
this
perhaps

there
are

a

any

this
questions

they

what
to

this
was

its

collecting

also
in

still

it

id
suspect
they
need
enough
housekeeping
that
even
untended
theyd
end
up
unusable

it
seems
to
always
quote

how
much
would
it
cost
to
collect
the

let

whenever
kinda

that
sat
around
for

before
someone
analyzed
it
for
the

hole
even
if
you
let
teh
bird
drift
it
may
get
hosed
by
some
cosmic
phenomena
since
this
would
be
a
shutdown
that
may
never
be

once

stated

every

computer
technology
was
actually
lower

slower
then
what
it
replaced
silicon
was
less
effective
then
the
germanium
products
then
available
gaas
was
less
capable
then
silicon
multiprocessors
were
slower
then
existent
single

what
the
argument
was
though
was
that
these
new
technologies
promised
either
theoretically
future
higher
performance
or
lower
cost
or
higher
densities
i
think
that
the
may
gfit
into
this

model
elvs
can
certainly
launch
more
weight

a

an
ssrt
offers
the
prospect

greater

lower

this
scheme
was
competing
with
the

last

i
havent
heard
which
won

now
i
recently
read
that
the
central

was
working
on
the
successor
to
the

which
must
be

so
the

are

this
is

nothing
is
very
clear

im
sure
if
salyut

gets

from
someone
they
will
continue
their
development
the
centaur
for
the
altas
is
about
meters
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
thats
a
good
fit
for
their
existing
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
sets
inside
a
shround
just
under
meters
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
loads
etc
but
since
the
centaur
survives
titan
launches
which
are
probably
worse
than
the
proton
those
titan
srbs
probably
shake
things
up
pretty
good
it
seems
feasible
except
the
centaur
is
a
very
fragile
thing
and
may
require
integration
on
the
pad
which
is
not
available
now
protons
are
assembled
and
transported
horizontially
does
anyone
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolted
to
a
proton
horizontally
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erected
on
the
pad
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facilities
added
to
the
proton
pads
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actually
built
and
of
course
any
centaur
support
systems

no
doubt
imported
from

the
most
common
arrangement
in
prince
henry
the
navigators
portugal
was
for
the
prince
to
put
up
part
of
the
money
and
merchants
to
put
up
the
rest
they
profits
from
the
voyage
would
then
be
shared
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it
done
than
because
they
expect
to
make
money
off
the
deal
the
problem
is
that
the
amount
of
prize
money
required
to
inspire
a
moon
base
is
much
larger
than
any
but
a
handful
of
individuals
or
corporations
can
even
consider
putting
up
the
kremer
prizes
human
powered
aircraft
orteigs
prize
lord
northcliffes
prize
for
crossing
the
atlantic
won
in
by
alcock
and
brown
were
much
smaller
the
technologies
required
were
within
the
reach
of
individual
inventors
and
the
prize
amounts
were
well
within
the
reach
of
a
large
number
of
wealthy
individuals
i
think
that
only
a
govt
could
afford
to
set
up

the

you
can
develop

delta

be
a

more
expensive
than
this
perhaps
but
there
are
less
ambitious
ways
of
bringing

down
quite
a
bit
ah
theres
the
rub
and
a
to
boot
for
the
purposes
of
a
contest
youll
probably
not
compete
ifn
you
cant
afford
the
ride
to
get
there
and
although
lower
priced
delivery
systems
might
be
doable
without
demand
its
doubtful
that
anyone
will
develop
a

system
course
if
a
low

system
existed
there
might
be
demand
i
wonder
if
there
might
be
some
way
of
structuring
a
contest
to
encourage
low
cost
payload
delivery
systems
the
accounting
methods
would
probably
be
the
hardest
to
work
out
for
example
would
you
allow
rockwell
to
loan
you
the

and
so
forth
any
plan
for
doing
sustained
lunar
exploration
using
existing
launch
systems
is
wasting
money
in
a
big
way
this
depends
on
the
how
soon
the
new
launch
system
comes
on
line
in
other
words
perhaps
a
great
deal
of
worthwhile
technology
life
support
navigation
etc
could
be
developed
prior
to
a
low

launch
system
you
wouldnt
want
to
use
the
expensive
stuff
forever
but
id
hate
to
see
folks
waiting
to
do
anything
until
a
low

mac
oops
i
mean
launch

comes
on

i
guess
id
simplify
this
to
say
that
waste
is
a
slippery
concept
if
your
goal
is
manned
lunar
exploration
in
the
next
years
then
perhaps
its
not
wasted
money
if
your
goal
is
to
explore
the

you

maybe
a

lockheed

they
should

about

i

i
assume
they
looked

found

how
long

it

since
it

you
might
just

really
obnoxious

a

questions
for
those
frothing
at

to
ask
themselves
how

this

supposed

stay

sounds
like
it
would
have
a

not
a

be
in

fairly
low

just
what
orbital

are
we
talking

here
what
real
impact
are
we
talking
about
really
how
many
optical
astronomers
are
really
going
to
be
impacted
which
is
more
important
adding
a
few
extra
days
of

optical

getting
the

the

the

the

would
seem
to
be
one

the
other
since
the
advertising
is
being
used
to

if
your
answer
to

was
the
astronomers
then
feel
free
to
come
up

around

during

one
of
the

involved
in

discussions
a

engineer
named
preston
carter
passed
the
suggestion
on
to
some
entreprenurial
types
and
mike
lawson
is
apparently
going
ahead
with
it
preston
is
now
at
llnl
and
is
working
with
space
marketing
on
the
sensors
that
might
be
carried
nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
actually
that
sounds
unlikely
i
dont
know
what
the
launch
vehicle
would
be
but
i
would
expect
it
to
go
on
a
commercial
launcher
certainly
not
on
the
shuttle
and
the
fraction
of
the
cost
paid
to
nasa
for
eg
launch
support
would
probably
cover
nasas
incremental
costs
pretty
well
this
may
look
like
environmental
vandalism
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
marketing
told
us
yesterday
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
he
explainedadvertising
is
just
to
help

costs
this
may
be
the
purpose
for
the
university
of
colorado
people
my
guess
is
that
the
purpose
for
the
livermore
people
is
to
learn
how
to
build
large
inflatable
space
structures
no
as

llnl

im

folks
around

would

but
after
all
the
us
did
the
echo
satellites

and
an

would
not
be
much
closer

an

was

for
that

what
do

not

while
i
happen
to
personally
dislike
the

mostly
because
ive
got
a
background
in

its
hardly
vandalism
it
would
be
a
shortlived
intrusion
on
the
night
sky
doing
no
permanent
damage
and
actually
hurting
only
a
small
subset
of
astronomers
on
the
other
hand
it
would
certainly
draw
attention
to
space
if
this
is
true
i
think
its
a
great
idea
learning
how
to
build
structures
in
space
in
an
essential
step
towards

development

unfortunately
this
is
not

to
contribute

to

such

also
monitors

demonstrates
creative
use
of

funding
in

so
much
the

is
nasa

supporting

the

even

you

your

tffreebaindyvaxiupuiedu
writes
in
my
first
posting
on
this
subject
i
threw
out
an
idea
of
how
to
fund
such
a
contest
without
delving
to
deep
into
the
budget
i
mentioned
granting
mineral
rights
to
the
winner
my
actual
wording
was
mining
rights
somebody
pointed
out
quite
correctly
that
such
rights
are
not
anybodys
to
grant
although
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
fait
accompli
situation
for
the
winner
so
how
about
this
give
the
winning
group
i
cant
see
one
company
or
corp
doing
it
a
or
year
moratorium
on
taxes
tom
freebairn
who
says
there
is
no
mineral
rights
to
be
given
who
says
the
un
or
the
us
government
major
question
is
if
you
decide
to
mine
the
moon
or
mars
who
will
stop
you
the
un
cant
other
than
legal
tom
foolerie
can
the
truly
inforce
it
if
you
go
to
the
moon
as
declare
that
you
are
now
a
soverign
nation
who
will
stop
you
from
doing
it
maybe
not
acknowledge
you
why
cant
a
small
company
or
corp
or
organization
go
an
explore
the
great
beyond
of
space
what
right
does
earth
have
to
say
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not
maybe
i
am
a
few
years
ahead
on
this
it
is
liek
the
old
catholic
church
stating
which
was
portugals
and
what
was
spains
and
along
came
the
reformation
and
made
it
all
null
and
void
what
can
happen
is
to
find
a
nation
which
is
acknowledged
and
offer
your
services
as
a
space
miner
and
then
go
mine
the
asteroidsmarsmoon
or
what
ever
as
long
as
yur
sponsor
does
not
get
in
trouble
basically
find
a
country
who
wants
to
go
into
space
but
cant
for
soem
reason
or
another
but
who
will
give
you
a
home
such
as
saudia
arabia
or
whatever
there
are
nations
in
the
world
who
are
not
part
of
the
un
got
to
them
and
offer
your
services
and
such
i
know
that
sound
crazy
but
is
it
also
once
you
have
the
means
to
mine
the
moon
or
whatever
then
just
do
it
the
un
if
done
right
can
be
made
to
be
so
busy
with
something
else
they
will
not
care
if
your
worried
about
the
us
do
the
same
thing
why
be
limited
by
the
short
sighted
people
of
earth
after
all
they
have
many
other
things
to
worry
about
that
if
someone
is
mining
the
moon
or
mars
or
what
ever
basically
what
i
am
saying
is
where
is
that
drive
of
yeasteryears
to
go
a
little

farther
out

i

touched
upon
it
might
have
been
some

i
know

are
possible
because
they
showed
a

full
of
this

and
put
a
white
mouse
rat
in
it
since
the
liquid
was
not
dense
the
mouse
would
float
so
it
was
held
down
by
tongs
clutching
its
tail
the
thing
struggled
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
certainly
held
down
long
enough
so
that
it
was

it
never

the

basically
what
weve

is
to

that
we

adaptability
for
reacting
to
realtime
situations
in
laying
out
the
specific
tasks
to
be
completed
on

and
installing

are
priority

during

recognizing
that
the

gyros

wfpc

would
consume
most

set

five

were
deemed
appropriate
said
milt
heflin
lead
flight
director
for
the
mission
while
the
five
spacewalks
will
be
unprecedented
the
use
of
two
alternating
spacewalk
teams
will
alleviate
placing
more
stress
on
the

than
previous

requiring
two
three

heflin
said
in

for
all

it
is
necessary
to
formulate
a
work
schedule
that
represents
as
realistic
a
timeline
as
possible
to
accomplish
the

calls
for
at

five
water

integrated

lasting

in
addition
many

underwater

runs
will
practice
individual
tasks
in
each
spacewalk
various
refinements
to
the
specific
tasks
on
each
spacewalk
will
be
made
based
on
actual
training
experience
during
the
months
prior
to
the
mission
also
lessons
learned
from
other
spacewalks
leading
up
to
the
flight
will
be
valuable
in
assisting
the
crew
in
its
training
techniques
endeavours
june

both
will
include
spacewalks
to
evaluate
some
of
the
unique

to

the

april
sirtf
is
still
very
much
in
business
by
mark
whalen
in
these
times
of
extratight
nasa
budgets
the
very
survival
of
a
number
of
missions
has
been
uncertain
but
thanks
to
major
design
refinements
implemented
in
recent
months
jpls
space
infrared
telescope
facility
sirtf
a
major
project
considered
to
be
in
trouble
a
couple
of
years
ago
is
alive
and
well
according
to
project
scientist
michael
werner
a
lighter
spacecraft
revised
orbit
and
shorter
mission
have
added
up
to
a
less
expensive
project
with
tremendous
scientific
power
and
a
bright
future
said
werner
designed
as
a
followup
to
the
highly
successful
infrared
astronomical
satellite
iras
and
cosmic
background
explorer
cobe
missions
sirtf
a
cryogenically

observatory
for

is
scheduled
for

in

if
plans
proceed
as
scheduled
iras
pioneering
work
in
spacebased
infrared
astronomy
years
ago
allowed
astronomers
to
view
the
milky
way
as
never
before
and
revealed
among
other
things
galaxies
and
comets
it
provided
a
sky
survey
times
more
sensitive
than
any
previously
available
from
groundbased
observations
cobe
has
measured
the
infrared
and
microwave
background
radiation
on
large
angular
scales
and
revealed
new
facts
about
the
early
universe
but
to
illuminate
sirtfs
potential
jim
evans
jpls
manager
of
astrophysics
and
fundamental
physics
preprojects
recently
said
that
the
project
is
to
million
times
more
capable
than
iras
based
on
technological
advances
in
infrared
detector
arrays
however
despite
the
enormous
strides
in
infrared
exploration
sirtf
promised
and
the
fact
that
it
was
cited
as
the
highest
priority
new
initiative
for
all
of
astronomy
in
the
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
it
took
a
diet
or
die
directive
from
nasa
headquarters
last
year
to
keep
the
project
going
according
to
werner
the
project
is
now
known
as
atlas
sirtf
based
on
the
key
factor
in
its
new
design
the
satellite
will
orbit
the
sun
instead
of
the
earth
permitting
the
use
of
an
atlas
rocket
launch
instead
of
the
formerly
proposed
and
heavier
titan
the
main
advantage
of
the
solar
orbit
is
that
you
can
use
all
of
your
launch
capability
for
boosting
the
payload
you
dont
have
to
carry
up
a
second
rocket
to
circularize
the
orbit
werner
said
the
other
advantage
to
a
solar
orbit
he
said
is
that
its
in
a
better
thermal
environment
away
from
the
heat
of
the
earth
additional
major
changes
in
sirtfs
redesign
include
shortening
the
mission
from
five
to
three
years
and
building
a
spacecraft
that
is
less
than
half
as
heavy
as
in
the
original
plan
atlas
sirtf
will
weigh
kilograms
pounds
compared
to
titan
sirtfs
kilograms
pounds
all
of
that
adds
up
to
a
less
stressful
launch
environment
werner
said
and
a
cost
savings
of
more
than
million
for
the
launch
in
addition
to
increased
savings
in
the
design
of
the
smaller
less
massive
spacecraft
werner
said
sirtfs
redesign
came
as
a
result
of
congress
telling
nasa
youre
trying
to
do
too
many
things
if
you
want
us
to
support
sirtf
which
is
a
good
project
develop
a
plan
to
see
how
it
fits
into
nasas
overall
strategy
shortly
thereafter
sirtf
was
named
as
nasas
highest
priority
flagship
scientific
mission
by
the
interdisciplinary
space
sciences
advisory
committee
in
addition
to
the
blessing
from
the
national
academy
of
sciences
while
the
spacecraft
and
its
instruments
required
descoping
to
keep
the
project
alive
sirtfs
major
scientific
contribution
always
promised
to
come
about
from
its
advanced
infrared
detector
arrays
which
will
allow
images
to
be
developed
tens
of
thousands
of
times
faster
than
before
according
to
evans
up
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
werner
said
all
infrared
astronomy
was
done
with
single
detectors
or
very
small
arrays
of
individually
assembled
detectors
since
then
the
department
of
defense
has
developed
a
program
to
produce
arrays
of
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
detectors
rather
than
just
a
few
and
those
are
very
well
suited
for
use
on
sirtf
werner
noted
that
in
addition
to
dealing
with
budget
pressures
congress
is
currently
watching
nasa
projects
with
an
eye
out
for
any
technological
spinoff
on
that
question
i
think
we
have
some
things
to
say
he
said
because
the
detectors
were
using
are
straight
off
various
military
developments
also
sirtf
will
be
built
by
the
us
aerospace
industry
and
its
a
real
technological
and
engineering
challenge
in
addition
to
being
a
tremendous
scientific
project
sirtf
will
be
used
by
the
entire
astronomical
community
werner
added
but
the
revised
threeyear
mission
puts
a
premium
on
observing
time
we
have
to
educate
the
user
community
and
develop
a
program
that
involves
early
surveys
and
quick
turnaround
of
the
data
werner
said
the
downsizing
of
the
project
required
a
reduction
in
scope
and
complexity
of
sirtfs
three
instruments
the
infrared
spectrograph
infrared
array
camera
and
multiband
imaging
photometer
however
these
reductions
will
only
result
in
losses
of
efficiency
rather
than
capability
he
said
the
project
hopes
to
start
a
phase
b
activity
in
which
will
provide
a
detailed
concept
for
development
and
design
building
the
hardware
would
begin
about
two
years
later
projected
cost
estimates
evans
said
are
million
i
am
very
optimistic
about
sirtf
he
said
it
will
provide
a
tremendous
return
for
the
investment
werner
added
that
an
additional
benefit
from
the
project
will
be
the
enrichment
of
our
intellectual
and
cultural
environment
people
on
the
street
are
very
interested
in
astronomy
black
holes
the
possibility
of
life
on
other
planets
the
origin
of
the
universe
and
those
are
the
kind
of
questions
sirtf
will
help
answer

and
were
intended
to
maintain
cooperation
between

participating

of

a

the
japanese

space
observing

satellite
with
its
radio
telescope
and
a
russian
radioastron

both
spacecraft
will
team
up
with
groundbased
radio
telescopes
located
around
the
world
to
create
a
radio
telescope
network
that
astronomers
hope
will
expand

power
by
a
factor
of
japans
vsop
satellite
will
use

to

science
while
the
russian

spacecraft
will
exploit
a
larger
earth
orbit
to
conduct
exploratory
radio

each
satellite
will
point
at
a
source
target
for
roughly
hours
while
approximately
groundbased
radio
telescopes
will
simultaneously
point
at
the
same
source
object
while
within
view
on
earth
according
to
dr
joel
smith
jpls
project
manager
for
the
us
space
vlbi
meetings
like
those
held
at
jpl
will
permit
japan
and
russia
who
have
little
previous
experience
in
radio
interferometry
to
establish
working
relationships
with
the
radio
astronomy
communities
that
will
be
vital
during
the
complex
observations
required
by
the
space
vlbi
project
one
of
our
main
activities
is
developing
the
methodology
for
international
coordination
because
the
two
spacecraft
simultaneously
rely
on
the
corresponding
tracking
stations
while
using
the
groundbased
radio
telescopes
to
observe
the
same
celestial
objects
said
smith
three
new
tracking
antennas
are
being
built
at
dsn
facilities
and
other
three
other
tracking
facilities
located
in
japan
russia
and
green
bank
wva
this
global
network
of
groundbased
radio
telescopes
will
use
precision
clocks
and
highspeed
recorders
to
collect
observation
data
and
forward
the
information
to
a
correlator
located
at
the
national
radio
astronomy
observatory
in
socorro
nm
the
correlator
will
combine
and
process
data
then
make
it
available
to
mission
investigators
in
moscow
tokyo
and
jpl
via
electronic
mail
smith
is
optimistic
that
the
massive
radio
telescope
created
by
the
space
vlbi
network
will
provide
radio
astronomers
with
better
resolution
than
has
ever
been
achieved
before
by
groundbased
radio
telescopes
allowing
astronomers
to
take
a
closer
look
at
distant
objects
in
space
there
is
a
long
history
of
radio
astronomy
using
groundbased
telescopes
said
smith
what
we
intend
to
do
is
to
extend
radio
astronomy
into
earth
orbit
our
goal
is
to
look
deeper
into
the
cores
of
galactic
nuclei
quasars
and
other
active
radio
sources
to
understand
what
drives
those
things
we
have
seen
so
far
with
radio
astronomy
smith
noted
that
if
one
examines
the
active
galactic
nuclei
youll
find
jets
appearing
to
spew
at
speeds
greater
than
light
and
at
energy
levels
that
are
millions
of
times
greater
than
you
would
expect
he
said
some
astronomers
believe
that
black
holes
may
be
located
in
the
cores
of
these
galaxies
and
that
they
may
fuel
the
jets
smith
hopes
that
by
using
space
vlbi
to
look
further
into
the
cores
this
theory
may
be
supported
or
disproved
russian
spaceflight
hardware
including
transponders
and
transmitters
are
now
being
tested
in
the
united
states
and
japanese
hardware
is
scheduled
to
arrive
for
testing
later
this
year
analysis
of
this
hardware
will
permit
us
scientists
and
engineers
to
understand
how
to
modify
the
highspeed
vlba
correlator
operating
at
the
nrao
in
order
to
accommodate
the
odd
data
patterns
that
will
originate
from
the
more
than
groundbased
radio
telescopes
involved
in
space
vlbi
smith
is
particularly
pleased
that
meetings
with
the
japanese
and
russian
space
agency
officials
like
those
held
at
jpl
in
march
have
proceeded
smoothly
yet
he
knows
that
the
political
uncertainty
in
russia
could
jeopardize
that
countrys
participation
in
the
project
nothing
is
ever
smooth
he
said
but
the
russians
have
been
incredibly
open
with
us
we
always
anticipated
some
likelihood
that
we
will
not
succeed
because
of
political
factors
beyond
our
control
yet
there
tends
to
be
a
way
of
keeping
these
things
going
because
scientists
on
both
sides
are
trying
hard
and
people
recognize
the
value
of
cooperation
at
this
level
smith
points
out
that
the
japanese
space
agency
has
more
at
stake
than
just
fulfilling
an
international
commitment
to
a
science
mission
the
japanese
have
been
extremely
cooperative
since
international
cooperation
is
essential
to
their
science
mission
he
said
but
smith
also
noted
that
japanese
space
agency
officials
look
at
the
us
space
vlbi
mission
as
an
opportunity
to
showcase
the
technology
involved
with
vsop

and
their
highly
regarded
mach
v
launch
vehicle
yet
regardless
of
the
risks
involved

this

which
he
calls
geode
rough
on

but
a
gem
on
the
inside
or
the
et
strongback
with
integrated
hab
modules
and
centrifuge
as
you
can
see
from
file
geodeagif
it
uses
a
space
shuttle
external
tank
et
in
place
of
much
of
the
truss
which
is
currently
part
of
space
station
freedom
the
white
track
on
the
outside
of
the
et
is
used
by
the
station
remonte
manipulator
system
srms
and
by
the
reaction
control
system
rcs
pod
this
allows
the
rcs
pod
to
move
along
the
track
so
that
thrusting
can
occur
near
the
center
of
gravity
cg
of
the
station
as
the
mass
properties
of
the
station
change
during
assembly
the
inline
module
design
allows
the
shuttle
to
dock
more
easily
because
it
can
approach
closer
to
the
stations
cg
and
at
a
structurally
strong
part
of
the
station
in
the
current
ssf
design
docking
forces
are
limited
to
pounds
which
seriously
constrains
the
design
of
the
docking
system
the
et
would
have
a
hatch
installed
preflight
with
little
additional
launch
mass
weve
always
had
the
ability
to
put
an
et
into
orbit
contrary
to
some
rumors
which
have
circulated
here
but
weve
never
had
a
reason
to
do
it
while
we
have
had
some
good
reasons
not
to
performance
penalties
control
debris
generation
and
eventual
deorbit
and
impact
footprint
once
onorbit
we
would
vent
the
residual
the
et
insulation
sofi
either
a
erodes
onorbit
from
impact
with
atomic
oxygen
or
b
stays
where
it
is
and
we
deploy
a
kevlar
sheath
around
it
to
protect
it
and
keep
it
from
contaminating
the
local
space
environment
option
b
has
the
advantage
of
providing
further
micrometeor
protection
the
et
is
incredibly
strong
remember
it
supports
the
whole
stack
during
launch
and
could
serve
as
the
nucleus
for
a
much
more
ambitious
design
as
budget
permits
the
white
module
at
the
end
of
et
contains
a
set
of
control
moment
gyros
to
be
used
for
attitude
control
while
the
rcs
will
be
used
for
gyro
desaturation
the
module
also
contains
a
deorbit
system
which
can
be
used
at
the
end
of
the
stations
life
to
perform
a
controlled
deorbit
so
we
dont
kill
any
more
kangaroos
like
we
did
with
skylab
the
centrifuge
which
has
the

volume
as
a
hab
module
could
be
used
for
longterm
studies
of
the
effects
of
lunar
or
martian
gravity
on
humans
the
centrifuge
will
be
used
as
a
momentum
storage
device
for
the
whole
attitude
control
system
the
centrifuge
is
mounted
on
one
of
the
modules
opposite
the
et
and
the
solar
panels
this
design
uses
most
of
the
existing
ssf
designs
for
electrical
data
and
communication
systems
getting
leverage
from
the
ssf
work
done
to

mark

at

hi
i
was
reading
through
the

handbook
and
somewhere
in

the
author
discusses
solar
sails
and
the
forces
acting
on
them
when
and
if
they
try
to
gain
an
initial
acceleration
by
passing
close
to
the
sun
in
a
hyperbolic
orbit
the
magnitude
of
such
accelerations
he
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
he
also
says
that
this
is
may
not
be
a
big
problem
for
manned
craft
because
humans
and
this
was
published
in
have
already
withstood
accelerations
of
all
this
is
very
longwinded
but
heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
can
this
be
extended
to
larger
accelerations
are
you
sure
is
the
right
number
as
far
as
i
know

are

to

it

alot

use

i

option
a

marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
i
cant
believe
that
a

would
have
any
significant
effect
on
the
overall
sky
brightness
venus
is
visible
during

but
nobody
complains
about
that
besides
its
in
leo
so
it
would
only
be
visible
during
twilight
when
the
sky
is
already
bright
and
even
if
it
would
have
some
miniscule
impact
it
would
be
only
for
a

the

of
nikola

by

this
remarkable
conductivity
of

including
the

at

led
tesla
to
suggest
in
a
published
statement
in
a
system
of
lighting
on
a
terrestrial
scale
in
which
he
proposed
to
treat
the
whole
earth
with
its
surrounding
atmosphere
as
if
it
were
a

the
whole

would
be
transformed
into
a

completely

making

now
my
comments
id
like
to
add
that
some
of
the
protests
do
not
come
from
a
strictly
practical
consideration
of
what
pollution
levels
are
acceptable
for
research
activities
by
professional
astronomers
some
of
what
i
would
complain
about
is
rooted
in
aesthetics
many
readers
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heavens
were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
the
effect
of
the
first
sputniks
and
echo
etc
on
this
view
could
only
happen
once
to
see
a
light
crossing
the
night
sky
and
know
it
was
put
there
by
us
puny
people
is
still
impressive
and
the
sense
of
size
one
gets
by
assimilating
the
scales
involved
is
also
awesome
even
if
the
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
involved
is
still
dwarfed
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
there
is
still
a
hunger
for
the
pure
beauty
of
a
virgin
sky
yes
i
know
aircraft
are
almost
always
in
sight
i
have
to
live
in
a
very
populated
area
miles
from
an
international
airport
currently
where
light
pollution
on
the
ground
is
ghastly
the
impact
of
humans
is
so
extreme
here
virtually
no
place
exists
that
has
not
been
shaped
sculpted
modified
trashed
or
whipped
into
shape
by
the
hands
of
man
in
some
places
the
only

larger
than

are
humans

i
visited
some
friends
up
in
the
appalacian
mountains
one
weekend
getting
away
from
it
all
paved
roads
indoor
plumbing
malls
and
it
felt
good
for
a
while
then
i
quickly
noticed
the
hollow
was
directly
under
the
main
flight
path
into
dulles
miles
to
the
east
their
security
light
didnt
help
matters
much
either
but
ive
heard
the
artic
wilderness
gets
lots
of
high
air
traffic
so
i
know
the
skies
are
rarely
perfect
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i
mean
theyve
been
trying
this
forever
like

advertisements
would
be
if
seen
up
so
high
if
ya
gotta
make
a

displaying

in

at
least
consider
the
reactions
from
those
for
whom
the
sky
is
a
last
beautiful
refuge
from
the
baseness
of
modern
life
to
be
open
about
this

ill

if
i
can
it
is
my

i
suppose
i
could
be

an

for
supporting
this

on

while

not

is

would

that
an

note
for

the

geared

producing

staget

reusable

vehicle
the
dcx
vehicle
is
a

vehicle
designed
to
test
some
of
the
concepts
invovled
in
ssto
it
is
currently
undergoing
tests
the

nelson
of
macdonnell
douglas
gave
a
talk
entitled
optimizing
techniques
for
advanced
space
missions
here
at
the
university
of
illinois
mr
nelsons
job
involves
using
software
to
simulate
trajectories
and
determine
the
optimal
trajectory
within
given
requirements
although
he
is
not
directly
involved
with
the
delta
clipper
project
he
has
spent
time
with
them
recently
using
his
software
for
their
applications
he
thus
used
the
dcy
project
for
most
of
his
examples
while
i
dont
think
the
details
of
implicit
trajectory
simulation
are
of
much
interest
to
the
readers
i
hope
they
arent
i
fell
asleep
during
that
part
i
think
that
many
of
you
will
be
interested
in
some
of
the
details
gleaned
from
the
examples
the
first
example
given
was
the
maximization
of
payload
for
a
polar
orbit
the
main
restriction
is
that
acceleration
must
remain
below
gs
i
assume
that
this
is
driven
by
passenger
constraints
rather
than
hardware
constraints
but
i
did
not
verify
that
the
delta
clipper
y
version
has
engines
boosters
and
sustainers
the
boosters
which
have
a
lower
isp
are
shut
down
in
midflight
thus
one
critical
question
is
when
to
shut
them
down
mr
nelson
showed
the
following
plot
of
acceleration
vs
time
g
as
ascii
graphs
go
this
is
actually
fairly
good
the
big
difference
is
that
the
lines
g
made
by
the
should
be
curves
which
are
concave
up
the
data
is
only
approximate
as
the
graph
wasnt
up
for
very
long
g
g
sec
sec
as
mentioned
before
a
critical
constraint
is
that
g
levels
must
be
kept
below
initially
all
eight
engines
are
started
as
the
vehicle
burns
fuel
the
accelleration
increases
as
it
gets
close
to
the
booster
engines
are
throtled
back
however
they
quickly
become
inefficient
at
low
power
so
it
soon
makes
more
sense
to
cut
them
off
altogether
this
causes
the
dip
in
accelleration
at
about
seconds
eventually
the
remaining
sustainer
engines
bring
the
g
level
back
up
to
about
and
then
hold
it
there
until
they
cut
out
entirely
the
engine
cutoff
does
not
acutally
occur
in
orbit
the
trajectory
is
aimed
for
an
altitude
slightly
higher
than
the
desired
and
the
last
vestiges
of
air
drag
slow
the
vehicle
slightly
thus
lowering
the
final
altitude
to
that
desired
questions
from
the
audience
paraphrased
q
would
it
make
sense
to
shut
down
the
booster
engines
in
pairs
rather
than
all
at
once
a
very
perceptive
worth
considering
they
have
not
yet
done
the
simulation
shutting
down
all
four
was
part
of
the
problem
as
given
q
so
what
was
the
final
payload
for
this
trajectory
a
cant
tell
us
read
aviation
leak
he
also
apparently
had
a
good
propulsion
example
but
was
told
not
to
use
it
my
question
does
anyone
know
if
this
security
is
due
to
sdio
protecting
national
security
or
md
protecting
their
own
interests
the
second
example
was
reentry
simulation
from
orbit
to
just
before
the
pitch
up
maneuver
the
biggest
constraint
in
this
one
is
aerodynamic
heating
and
the
parameter
they
were
trying
to
maximize
was
crossrange
he
showed
graphs
of
heating
using
two
different
models
to
show
that
both
were
very
similar
and
i
think
we
were
supposed
to
assume
that
this
meant
they
were
very
accurate
the
end
result
was
that
for
a
polar
orbit
landing
at
ksc
the
dcy
would
have
about
degrees
of
crossrange
and
would
start
its
reentry
profile
about
degrees
south
latitude
i
would
have
asked
about
the
landing
maneuvers
but
he
didnt
know
about
that
aspect
of
the
flight

rimsat
was
considered
an
appropriate
topic
because
the

is

i

it
also
helped
that
his

program
the
concept
behind
rimsat
apparently
began
when
matt
neilson
went
to
tonga
to
visit
a
friend
while
he
was
there
he
somehow
ended
up
visiting
the
king
who
happened
to
be
a
big
tv
fan
matt
bought
the
king
a
satellite
dish
which
the
king
thought
was
really
nifty
since
tonga
has
a
gnp
of
about
million
his
majesty
asked
if
there
was
any
way
to
make
money
off
this
matt
thought
there
probably
was
so
at
his
suggestion
tonga
applied
for
geosynchronous
satellite
slots
while
this
isnt
entirely
off
the
wall
it
was
very
unusual
seeing
as
tonga
was
a
tiny
kingdom
with
no
space
program
and
is
a
lot
of
slots
the
whole
thing
was
debated
in
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
and
carl
hilliard
who
is
apparently
a
respected
space
lawyer
wrote
several
opinions
supporting
tongas
case
eventually
tonga
ended
up
with
slots
ranging
from
e
to
e
slots
are
designated
by
the
longitude
over
which
they
reside
according
to
sternberg
four
of
these
from
e
to
e
are
the
best
in
the
world
because
they
are
excellently
placed
for
communications
between
hawaii
and
the
pacific
rim
rimsat
was
formed
to
use
these
slots
it
was
officially
formed
in
nevis
as
a
tax
haven
they
tried
for
a
few
years
to
raise
funds
in
the
west
however
to
fill
slots
with
western
satellites
launched
on
western
launchers
would
have
cost
approximately
billion
its
not
easy
to
raise
that
kind
of
money
eventually
they
hit
upon
the
idea
of
using
russian
hardware
they
began
negotiating
with
glavkosmos
for
hardware
mr
sternberg
describes
operating
in
moscow
in
such
harsh
terms
that
i
dont
think
ill
visit
there
for
a
long
time
besides
a
significant
lack
of
creature
comforts
he
was
not
happy
with
the
way
that
people
operate
for
example
everybody
can
sell
you
everything
everyone
can
show
the
proper
documents
and
licenses
that
indicate
they
are
the
only
ones
who
have
the
authority
to
sell
what
ever
you
want
to
by
eventually
rimsat
arranged
a
deal
with
glavkosmos
for
satellites
at
a
cost
of
million
however
glavkosmos
lost
favor
after
the
coup
sternberg
says
that
this
is
because
they
were
basically
a
bunch
of
kgb
operatives
who
went
to
trade
shows
and
picked
up
lots
of
brochures
since
glavkosmos
was
out
of
power
he
had
to
renegotiate
the
deal
with
the
new
authorities
he
again
described
life
in
a
moscow
hotel
in
rather
unfavorable
terms
eventually
he
worked
out
a
deal
and
on
dec
he
met
with
koptev
who
heads
the
russian
space
program
to
sign
the
deal
koptev
insisted
on
a
few
concessions
before
signing
and
according
to
sternberg
he
arranged
these
new
rules
to
allow
himself
to
form
another
company
to
do
the
exact
same
thing
as
rimsat
the
next
step
was
to
meet
with
the
builders
of
the
hardware
npo
applied
mechanics
npo
pm
to
use
their
acronym
this
organization
is
located
in
siberia
cant
figure
out
how
to
spell
the
town
i
need
an
atlas
and
has
built
about
vehicles
since
the
dawn
of
the
space
age
sternberg
commented
that
siberians
are
very
different
from
musovites
they
are
hard
workers
honest
people
who
team
up
to
get
things
done
very
much
like
midwesterners
at
this
point
there
were
some
comments
from
the
audience
that
agreed
with
his
opinion
on
both
siberians
and
midwesterners
sternberg
had
lots
of
good
things
to
say
about
npo
pm
his
company
is
apparently
lookng
for
million
to
invest
in
the
firm
to
become
partnersit
apparently
costs
the
russians
about
million
to
build
a
satellite
that
would
sell
for
million
in
the
west
if
you
want
to
give
them
specifications
theyll
build
you
a
satellite
for
the
particular
satellites
that
rimsat
will
be
using
costs
run
about
per
transponder
year
this
compares
to
ty
in
the
us
they
can
sell
their
time
for
about
million
compared
to
million
in
the
us
rimsat
will
launch
their
satellites
on
protons
to
get
the
best
prices
they
bought
in
bulk
they
have
the
rights
to
twelve
launches
so
if
any
of
you
need
a
lift
i
can
give
you
their
address
the
first
launch
is
scheduled
for
october
and
they
are
getting
one
used
satellite
from
the
russians
which
is
being
moved
into
place
now
tidbits
sternberg
says
this
kind
of
thing
has
to
be
done
by
entrepreneurs
not
big
business
because
big
business
is
just
like
what
they
have
over
there
except
that
we
have
better
paper

in
the
bathroom
and
in

copier
russian
launches
are

promise
to
replace
a
failed
launch
within
months
major
investors
in
rimsat
include
russell
which
is
a
huge
retirement
fund
organization
cellsat
which
is
a
big
telecom
business
in
southeast
asia
and
a
fund
operated
by
some
of
the
big
names
in
us
aerospace
which
he
says
is
sort
of
an
insurance
policy
for
them
if
this
really
takes
off
he
downplayed
the
instabilites
in
the
exussr
saying
that
we
are
worried
partly
because
we
arent
used
to
seeing
russia
as
anything
but
an
unvarying
monolith
italy
gets
a
new
government
every
two
weeks
but
we
dont
worry
because
were
used
to
it
he
predicted
that
once
we
get
used
to
seeing
what
really
goes
on
in
russia
we
wont
worry
about
their
stability
as
much
part
of
the
problem
with
cooperative
ventures
is
the
problem
of
transfering
money
the
central
bank
has
a
policy
of
taking
hard
currency
payments
putting
in
their
coffers
and
replacing
the
rest
with
the
equivalent
value
in
rubles
to
get
around
this
rimsat
pays
their
hard
currency
into
an
austrian
bank
account
npo
pm
then
pays
their
contractors
with
foreign
currency
so
that
the
only
the
contractors
get
swindled
by
the
government
one
of
the
big
problems
rimsat
has
had
is
stonewalling
by
the
western
satellite
industry
however
intelsat
recently
bought
three
of
the
same
type
of
satellites
which
was
rather
reassuring
the
biggest
worry
most
people
have
about
russian
satellites
is
the
primitive
technology
and
shorter
lifetime
the
older
gorizont
horizon
satellites
have
a
lifetime
of
about
years
while
the
more
modern
express
satellites
compare
well
with
western
technology
and
last
about
years
while
this
is
much
shorter
than
years
for
western
satellites
sternberg
downplayed
the
difference
at
these
prices
they
can
afford
to
launch
new
ones
in
addition
shorter
lifetimes
mean
that
they
can
replace
their
equipment
with
newer
technology
so
they
will
be
able
to
compete
better
than
older

of

that

oort

tend
to
be
silly
even
by
the
standards
of

if
grbs
were
galactic

galaxy
you
would
expect
them
to
be
either
concentrated
in
the

of
the

population
or
towards
the
galactic
center
for
a
spherical

population
we
dont
see
this
so
if
they
are
galactic
they
must
be
in
a
halo
at
least
light
years
in
radius
and
we
would
probably
start
to
see
grbs
from
the

it

the

what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying
saucers
entering
hyperspace
but
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
that
most
everyone
assumes
that
they
are
colliding
nuetron
stars
or
spinning
black
holes
i
just
wondered
if
any
mechanism
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
pat
well
lets
seei
took
a
class
on
this
last
fall
and
i
have
no
notes
so
ill
try
to
wing
it
heres
how
i
understand
it
remember
from
stellar
evolution
that
black
holes
and
neutron
starspulsars
are
formed
from
high
mass
stars
high
mass
stars
live
fast
and
burn
hard
taking
appoximately
years
before
going
nova
or
supernova
in
this
time
they
dont
live
long
enough
to
get
perturbed
out
of
the
galactic
plane
so
any
of
these
if
assumed
to
be
the
sources
of
grbs
will
be
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
then
we
take
the
catalog
of
bursts
that
have
been
recieved
from
the
various
satellites
around
the
solar
system
pioneer
venus
has
one
either
pion
or
ginga
and
of
course
batse
and
we
do
distribution
tests
on
our
catalog
these
tests
all
show
that
the
bursts
have
an
isotropic
distributionevenly
spread
out
in
a
radial
direction
and
they
show
signs
of
homogeneity
ie
they
do
not
clump
in
any
one
direction
so
unless
we
are
sampling
the
area
inside
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
we
are
sampling
the
universe
not
cool
if
you
want
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
caused
these
things
now
i
suppose
you
are
saying
well
we
stil
only
may
be
sampling
from
inside
the
disk
well
not
necessarily
remember
we
have
what
is
more
or
less
an
interplanetary
network
of
burst
detectors
with
a
baseline
that
goes
waaaay
out
to
beyond
plutopioneer
so
we
should
be
able
with
all
of
our
detectors
de
tect
some
sort
of
difference
in
angle
from
satellite
to
satellite
heres
an
analogy
you
see
a
plane
overhead
you
measure
the
angle
of
the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrary
coordinate
system
one
of
your
friends
a
mile
away
sees
the
same
plane
and
measures
the
angle
from
the
zero
point
of
his
arbitrary
system
which
is
the
same
as
yours
the
two
angles
are
different
and
you
should
be
able
to
triangulate
the
position
of
your
burst
and
maybe
find
a
source
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
been
able
to
do
this
i
should
throw
in
why
halo
and
corona
models
dont
work
also
as
i
said
before
looking
at
the
possible
astrophysics
of
the
bursts
short
timescales
high
energy
black
holes
and
pulsars
exhibit
much
of
this
type
of
behavior
if
this
is
the
case
as
i
said
before
these
stars
seem
to
be
bound
to
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
especially
the
most
energetic
of
the
these
sources
when
you
look
at
a
simulated
model
where
the
bursts
are
confined
to
the
disk
but
you
sample
out
to
large
distances
say
mpc
you
should
definitely
see
not
only
an
anisotropy
towards
you
in
all
direction
but
a
clumping
of
sources
in
the
direction
of
the
galactic
center
as
i
said
before
there
is
none
of
these
characteristics
i
think
thats
all
of
itif
someone
needs
clarification
or
knows
something
that
i
dont
know
by
all
means
correct
me
i
had
the
honor
of
taking
the
bursts
class
with
the
person
who
has
done
the
modeling
of
these
different
distributions
so
we
pretty
much
kicked
around
every
possible
distribution
there
was

some
very
outrageous
sources

you
also
get

about
whether
the
lid
is
going
to
open
after
the

is
done
and
hst
is
inaccessible
to
the
shuttle
the
lid
stays
closed
for
the
duration
of
all
of
this
to
prevent
mirror
contamination
from
thrusters
and
the
like
the
original
plan
was
to
use
the
orbital

vehicle
to
do
the
reboost
the
omv
was
planned
to
be
a

suited

precisely
this

unfortunately
it

was

this

not

concentrated

there
changes

apiece
can
substantially
influence
the
annual
projection
if
we
look
forward
over

this

sector
should
retain
strong
sales
as
us
firms
have
been
very
successful
in
regaining

share
in

furthermore
sales

about

data

indicators
in

and
the
next
revision

then
i
expect
the

should
easily
top
m
if
the

back

projects
satellite

could

and
that
mobile

station
sales
are
expected
to
continue
to
growth
at
per

through
the

my
numbers
are
somewhat
more
pessimistic
for
nearterm

growth
but
i
agree
the
trend
should
be
for
substantial
growth
in
us
commercial

sales
over
at
least
the
next

my
pessimism
is
due
to
more
conservative
assumptions
on

capture
and
growth
in
leo

and

direct
broadcasting
services
i
dont
believe
all

players
in
the

and
in
the

delta
wins
two
key
launch
contracts
mcdonnell
douglas
corporation
which
builds
and
markets
the
delta
launch
vehicle
has
won
two
important
launch
contracts
motorola
inc
announced
in
mid
february
that
it
had
selected
the
delta
to
launch
most
of
the
satellites
in
the
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
and
in
mid
april
mcdonnell
douglas
was
awarded
the
usaf
medium
launch
vehicle
iii
contract
the
launch
services
contract
with
motorola
for
the
iridium
constellation
launch
is
for
at
launch
of
least
iridium
satellites
another
satellites
have
been
contracted
to
be
launched
by
khrunichev
enterprise
in
russian
on
proton
vehicle
launches
these
satellites
planned
for
the
delta
will
be
launched
at
a
time
providing
for
at
least
launches
additional
satellites
in
the
iridium
constellation
such
as
a
planned
onorbit
spares
may
also
be
launched
on
delta
although
details
of
the
launch
services
contract
were
reported
to
be
negotiation
and
not
yet
final
the
usaf
mlv
contract
also
went
to
mdc
bidding
a
variant
of
their
delta
ii
launcher
this
contract
is
only
initially
worth
million
but
establishes
a
set
of
launch
options
for
up
to
launches
encompassing
launches
from
through
these
launches
will
deploy
the
next
generation
of
the
usafs
global
positioning
system
block
iir
navigation
satellites
plus
other
programs
first
option
for
to
meet
the
usaf
launch
options
is
expected
to
be
exercised
this
year
after
which
the
usaf
is
expected
to
request
launches
of
up
to
deltas
per
year
for
at
least
years
under
this
contract
the
usaf
can
also
request
launch
on
demand
services
from
mdc
for
the
time
period
with
a
launch
to
occur
within
days
of
the
request
commentary
if
these
two
contracts
are
fulfilled
they
should
provide
an
excellent
business
base
for
mdcs
delta
launch
program
through
the
turn
of
the
century
combined
these
two
contracts
have
a
potential
for
about
launches
worth
about
m
to
mdc
and
sustaining
a
core
business
base
of
myear
other
contracts
for
international
and
commercial
payloads
as
well
as
for
nasa
medium
elvclass
payloads
will
add
to
this
business
base
keeping
mdc
as
a
viable
commerical
launch
company
however
it
should
be
noted
there
are
risk
elements
in
these
contracts
motorolas
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
has
not
yet
received
a
us
federal
communications
commission
license
for
operation
in
the
us
nor
has
motorola
lined
up
all
the
financing
and
financial
partners
for
the
iridium
venture
without
these
approvals
or
financial
backing
there
will
be
no
iridium
launches
but
hopefully
these
uncertainties
will
be
settled
this
year
similarly
the
usaf
mlv
iii
program
has
been
the
target
of
several
congressional
actions
which
have
slowed
the
production
of
the
gps
block
iir
satellites
and
deleted
the
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
program
in
favor
of
the
usaf
nlsspacelifter
program
at
this
time
while
it
appears
the
mlv
iii
contract
will
be
executed
future
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
and
other
usaf
commercial
launch
contracts
is
being
reconsidered
as
part
of
national
space
launch
strategy
reviews
some
opinions
expressed
from
within
the
administration
and
congress
propose
cancellation
of
all
elv
upgrade
programs
including
the
mlv
programs
in
favor
of
the
proposed
spacelifter
program
such
opinions
may
have
some
weight

will
be

the
first

was
approved
in

february
by
the

there
has
been
little

released
on

by

and
the
doc
other
than
the
announcement
of

this
was
reported
to
be
at

it
is
noteworthy
this
is
the
first
commercial

under
the

remote

act
the
act
as
passed
last
november
provides
that

remote

may
be
sold
to
users
at
differing
prices
prior
to
this
act
remote
sensing
data
from
all
satellites
had
to
be
sold
to
all
users
at
the
same
prices
and
private
remote

ventures
would
have
had
to
sell
at

there
are
rumors
of
several
other
potential
commercial
remote
sensing
ventures
working
their
way
through
the
system
at
different
stages
of
development
i
think
the
large

spot
satellite
systems
will
provide
the
majority
of
the
satellite
remote

data
market
for
the
next
decade
or
so
in
contrast
to
these
large
governmentsponsored
remote
sensing
systems
smaller
market
ventures
such
as
worldview
and
others
can
exploit
market
niches
and
use
innovative
technology
and
i
believe
can
find
profitability
on
the
margin
i
predict
there
may
be
some
very

the
morgan

indicates
gds
space

has
some
potential
as
a
moneymaker
despite
current
problems
if
they
can
get
their
act
together
sales
are
projected
to
be
about
m
in
which
will
probably
generate
a
loss
of
about
m
if
gd
can
capture
their
projected
share
of
the
space
launch
market
and
if
they
have
managed
to
clean
up
the
reliability
of
their
atlas
launchers
then
they
could
generate
healthy
profits
from
those
sales
but
until
they
demonstrate
the
atlas
centaur
program
is
back
on
track
this
division
will
continue
to
show
substantial
losses
in
response
to
the
selloff
rumors
in
my
opinion
this
operation
is
not
a
really
good
candidate
for
takeover
and
quick
profitability
to
do
such
a
takeover
the
current
set
corporate
and
divisional
management
would
be
replaced
with
another
set
from
outside
the
firm
in
gd
ssds
case
to
get
the
division
back
on
track
the
management
team
will
have
to
concentrate
hard
on
the
technical
problems
with
the
atlas
centaur
as
well
as
in
selling
atlas
services
this
would
indicate
only
another
firm
with
experience
in
rocket
launch
operations
could
find
such
talent
inhouse
and
be
able
to
convince
customers
to
buy
their
launch
services
optimally
the
firm
would
have
substantial
liquid
rocket
experience
and
experience
in

space
technology
internationally
as
well
candidates
for
this
might
be

which
detailed
their

one
of
the
significant
possible
changes
in
the
market
was
identified
as
the
arrival
of
new
launch
vehicles
including
russian
launch
systems
but
arianespace
predicts
that
in
the
long
term
investors
purchasing
launch
services
are
looking
for
the
best
trade
off
between
launch
service
quality
and
price
and
that
russian
and
other
new
launch
services
will
have
to
prove
out
their
capabilities
and
service
quality
and
their
market
penetration

their

surveys
annually
and

reported

their
prior
market
survey
in
a
past
issue
of
csnsti
comparing
the
two
surveys
there
arent
outstanding
differences
in
the
numbers
the
most
notable
change
is
the
consideration
of
new
data
compression
techniques
reducing
the
demand
for
new
physical
transponders
on
orbit
i
note
that
in
contrast
to
some
predictions
demand
for
space
based
communications
transponders
appears
to
be
remain
strong
while
fiber
optic
lines
are
making
substantial
inroads
into
the
established
pointtopoint
telecommunications
markets
growing
demand
for
telecommunications
services
world
wide
and
for
pointto
multipoint
broadcast
services
have
prevented
a
decrease
in
space
transponder
demand
fiberoptic
cables
provide
a
higher
capability
service
but
only
from
established
point
a
to
established
point
b
to
establish
a
fiberoptic
link
it
is
necessary
to
install
cable
between
the
points
and
while
there
are
improved
network
solutions
installing
a
large
network
of
distributed
fiberoptic
links
can
cost
millions
or
billions
of
dollars
for
broadcast
services
where
there
is
not
an
existing
ground
network
structure
satellites
still
offer
the
most
cost
effective
solution
and
if
new
services
are
required
into
a
new
region
it
is
cheaper
to
install
a
small
satellite
link
costing
only
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
tie
into
the
existing
global
satellite
network
this
allows
rapid
growth
of
new
satellite
services
and
has
kept
demand
high
the
replacement
market
for
fiberoptics
is
growing
as
well
since
as
demand
grows
between
the
points
serviced
it
becomes
cost
effective
to
later
install
a
fiberoptic
link
to
handle
the
increase
in
traffic
since
the
telecommunications
and
data
transfer
markets
are
still
growing
rapidly
satellite
market
projections
remain
rosy
but
satellites
are
also
getting
longer
orbital
lifetimes
current
generation
satellites
are
now
getting
guarantees
of
at
years
of
onorbit
service
or
more
in
contrast
to
years
of
service
from
last
generations
satellites
this
has
cut
back
some
of
the
launch
demand
as
satellite
owners
are
rescheduling
replacement
satellite
launches
over
longer
intervals
and
as
last
note
arianespace
didnt
flag
it
this
year
but
it
looks
like
the
space
transportation
market
will
be
rather
over
supplied
by
existing
launch
systems
in
the
near
term
the
annual
commercial
launch
demand
is
for
about
medium
sized
satellites
per
year
from
the
supply
side
ariane
is
capable
of
launching
up
to
about
a
dozen
medium
sized
satellites
a
year
delta
is
capable
of
about
per
year
atlas
is
capable
of
long
march
japans
hvehicle
russias
proton
capable
of
and
other
systems
such
as
zenit
and
soyuz
another
medium
launches
per
year
thats
a
lot
of
capability
for
a
small
market
we
can
only
expect
the
competition
to
intensify
for
commercial
launches
ntsb
investigates
pegasus
launch
over
aborted
abort
the
feb
pegasus
launch
by
orbital
sciences
corporation
has
spawned
an
investigation
over
an
apparent
violation
of
range
safety
rules
a
valid
abort
order
from
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
to
halt
the
mission
was
overridden
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
in
violation
of
range
safety
rules
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
pegasus
launch
countdown
one
of
two
abort
command
receivers
aboard
the
pegasus
failed
such
a
failure
typically
scrubs
a
launchand
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
at
wallops
island
va
issued
a
mission
abort
order
about
a
minute
before
the
scheduled
pegasus
launch
somehow
this
command
was
overridden
by
the
osc
launch
team
or
the
message
was
lost
in
the
communications
channels
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
despite
the
valid
abort
call
fortunately
the
pegasus
functioned
as
expected
and
the
abort
command
receiver
was
not
needed
but
this
incident
did
spark
an
investigation
since
a
valid
abort
order
was
given
under
agreedto
launch
constraint
rules
and
was
not
obeyed
leading
the
investigation
is
the
national
transportation
safety
board
ntsb
with
support
from
nasa
osc
and
the
air
force
this
investigation
marks
the
first
time
ntsb
has
taken
the
lead
on
an
incident
involving
a
space
launch
according
to
the
ntsb
their
investigation
will
take
about
months
and
is
primarily
looking
at
lines
of
authority
communications
links
and
safety
procedures
used
in
the
launch
commentary
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
ntsb
has
led
an
investigation
into
a
space
launch
their
leadership
was
requested
by
the
department
of
commerces
office
of
commercial
space
transportation
who
had
licensed
the
commercial
launch
at
the
time
of
writing
this
column
some
of
the
initial
investigations
have
been
concluded
and
some
of
the
results
are
starting
to
leak
out
into
the
trade
press
apparently
or
four
different
communications
channels
were
in
use
during
the
test
after
the
abort
destruct
receiver
stopped
responding
the
nasa
test
director
and
range
controller
in
the
mission
control
room
at
wallops
island
gave
abort
orders
about
a
minute
before
the
launch
according
to
the
mission
rules
this
should
have
stopped
the
launch
somehow
the
osc
test
conductor
ordered
the
abort
reversed
and
the
nasa
communicator
on
the
net
relayed
that
order
to
the
carrying
the
pegasus
at
about
seconds
before
launch
differing
explainations
of
exactly
how
this
happened
are
proposed
with
the
best
set
being
that
clear
lines
of
communications
and
clear
definition
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
mission
control
team
and
understanding
of
the
mission
rules
were
not
established
before
the
launch
as
we
see
more
and
more
commercial
launches
more
of
these
procedural
issues
are
going
to
crop
up
and
will
have
to
be
resolved
this
case
is
interesting
because
it
is
the
first
time
the
ntsb
has
been
called
in
to
investigate
a
commercial
launch
problem
as
they
do
with
commercial
aircraft
problems
i
think
this
problem
will
turn
out
to
be
primarily
problems
with
procedures
and
communications
and
will
be
cleared
up
with
issuance
of
guidelines
on
how
launch
communications
should
be
set
up
and
how
specific
lines
of
authority
should
be
delineated

commentary
theres
very
little
released
information
on

my
suspicion
is
it
is
another
russian
enterprise
looking
for
hard
currency
and
trying
to
capitalize
upon
their
inhouse
knowledge
of
exsoviet
launch

a
little
different
in
that

georgia
launch

dropped
from

in
late

georgia
tech
research
institute
released
the
results
of
a
preliminary
study
on
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
rocket
launching
site
in
camden
county
georgia
at
the
old
kingsland
missile
test
launching
site
on
the
atlantic
coast
the
preliminary
study
recommended
the
site
not
be
pursued
as
a
commercial
launch
site
stating
reopening
the
site
was
not
feasible
due
to
projected
low
investment
returns
plus
environmental
and
other
geographic
considerations
however
the
report
did
say
the
site
might
be
ideal
for
other
aerospace
uses
and
recommended
other
potential
uses
commentary
this
should
put
the
nails
in
the
coffin
of
the
kingsland
commercial
launch
site
while
other
sites
are
still
proceeding
with
commercial
launch
site
development
plans
kingsland
found
without
a
key
customer
to
act
as
anchor
tenant
and
if
substantial
infrastructure
had
to
be
put
in
then
the
expected
returns
were
too
low
to
justify
the
cost
of
development
this
might
point
out
some
key
discriminators
in
judging
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
launch
site
these
include
is
there
an
identified
key
customer
to
provide
core
usage
sufficient
to
recover
setup
costs
is
there
a
market
advantage
of
using
the
site
can
existing

be
used
or
modified
at
the

can

those

have
to
also
be
judged
against
these
criteria
in
my
opinion
some
of
these

are
flying
on
hope
and

through

havent

establish
any

there
might
be
a
connection
while
taiwan
has
the

the
current

might
not
support

can
be
used
in

there
are
internal
political
issues
between

chinese

but
putting
any

in

the

this

south
korea
has
been
quietly
working
to
develop
its
national
aerospace
industry
specifically
including
space
activities
im
noting
this
as
a
flag
that
potential
new
players
are
coming
into
the
commercial
space
market
as
part
of
their
national
effort
national
telecommunications
satellites
for

telecom
will
be
launched
in

m
is
planned
for
piggyback
launch
in
october
of
this
year
again
on

and
will
be
entirely
made
in
korea
projected
for
a
launch
will
be
an
environment
monitoring
microsatellite
this
satellite
may
be
the
precursor
to
a
series
of
small
earth
observation
satellites
the
keos
korean
earth
observation
system
project
which
has
been
submitted
for
approval
to
the
south
korean
government
would
use
two
or
three
spacecraft
equipped
with
optical
and
microwave
sensors
south
korean
press
reports
claim
there
is
also
a
parallel
military
effort
to
establish
the
capabilities
for
building
and
launching
small
military
satellites
by
supposedly
a
government
panel
had
been
established
to
oversee
such
an
effort
funded
at
us
m
between
and
in
anticipation
of
an
expected
pullout
of
us
intelligencegathering
systems
from
the
korean
peninsula
in
conjunction
with
all
of
these
reported
efforts
south
korean
is
also
pursuing
production
work
either
as
offsets
to
existing
aerospace
technology
contracts
for
example
mcdonnell
douglas
is
offsetting
production
of
some
delta
parts
to
south
korean
firms
as
part
of
the
koreasat
launch
contracts
or
for
production
of
consumer
space
items
among
other
products
south
korea
exports
satellite
receiver
television
setups
to
japan
and
samsung
has
announced
teaming
for
production
of
oscs
orbcomm
user
terminals
this
looks
like
a
very
aggressive
push
into
space
technologies
considering
that
east
asia
is
currently
the
fastest
growing
sector
for
commercial
space
services
primarily
for
telecommunications
a
south
korean
push
into
space
technologies
may
change
the
composition
of
commercial
space
market
there
over
the
next
decade
space
technology
indexes
through

as
announced
in
the
last
csnsti
each

will
give
the
results
of

regarding

stocks
and

the
table
below
summarizes
results
to
the
end
of

the
space
technology
index
did
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
market
as
a
whole
as
represented
by
the
sp
index
since
of
the
values
included
in
the
index
are
us

this
represents
a
general
increase
in
the
market
value
of
spacerelated

the
increase
in
the
first
quarter
is
more
than
in
all
of
which
is
a
very
promising
sign
although
future
months
may
reverse
this
trend
the
commercial
space

index
has
also
done
quite
well
but
the
pure

advertising
of
two
developments
have
brought
these
type
of
activities
back
to
the
forefront
in
first
in
february
the
russians
deployed
a
reflector
from
a
progress
vehicle
after
it
had
departed
from
the
mir
space
station
while
this
banner
reflector
was
blank
npo
energia
was
very
active
in
reporting
that
future
banner
reflectors
will
be
available
to
advertisers
who
could
use
a
space
based
video
of
their
logo
or
ad
printed
on
the
banner
in
a
tv
commercial
as
filmed
from
the
mir
the
second
development
has
been
that
space
marketing
inc
the
same
company
responsible
for
merchandising
space
on
the
conestoga
booster
and
comet
spacecraft
is
now
pushing
the
environmental
billboard
as
laid
out
by
smi
chief
engineer
dr
ron
humble
of
the
university
of
colorado
space
laboratory
and
preston
carter
of
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
the
environmental
billboard
is
a
large
inflatable
outer
support
structure
of
up
to
meters
advertising
is
carried
by
a
mylar
reflective
area
deployed
by
the
inflatable
frame
to
help
sell
the
concept
the
spacecraft
responsible
for
maintaining
the
billboard
on
orbit
will
carry
ozone
reading
sensors
to
continuously
monitor
the
condition
of
the
earths
delicate
protective
ozone
layer
according
to
mike
lawson
head
of
smi
furthermore
the
inflatable
billboard
has
reached
its
minimum
exposure
of
days
it
will
be
released
to
reenter
the
earths
atmosphere
according
to
imi
as
the
biodegradable
material
burns
it
will
release
ozonebuilding
components
that
will
literally
replenish
the
ozone
layer
the
remaining
spacecraft
will
monitor
the
atmosphere
for
another
year
before
it
too
reenters
and
burns
up
and
adds
to
the
ozone
supply
this
would
not
be
a
cheap
advertisement
costing
at
least
several
millions
of
dollars
exact
costs
were
not
available
but
smi
estimates
that
market
exposure
would
be
that
of
the
people
who
watched
the
superbowl
where
a
advertising
unit
cost
since
smi
is
located
in
atlanta
georgia
it
is
being
promoted
as
being
available
in
time
for
the
opening
of
the
summer
olympics
in
atlanta
but
back
to
brians
questions
and
does
anyone
have
any
more
details
other
than
what
was
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
serious
is
this
project
is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have
real
funding
see
above
as
for
serious
if
they
can
get
m
or
so
my
estimate
of
for
development
costs
and
a
flight
unit
plus
m
for
a
launch
then
its
probably
real
they
are
claiming
to
tailor
the
orbit
to
overfly
specific
locations
at
specific
times
for
optimum
advertising
impact
so
they
probably
cant
piggy
back
upon
someone
elses
planned
launch
and
will
have
to
buy
a
dedicated
launch
thats
a
m
cost
they
need
to
raise
right
there
and
there
will
probably
be
some
legal
challenges
to
this
as
well
note
there
is
one
potential
legal
challenge
to
smi
on
the
use
of
launch
vehicle
advertising
already
while
i
dont
think
the
legal
challenges
would
win
out
and
yes
i
am
an
amateur
astronomer
and
no
i
dont
really
like
the
idea
of
this
additional
light
pollution
but
i
know
of
no
prohibition
of
it
the
legal
challenges
and
court
fights
would
probably
remove
any
positive
aspects
of
the
advertising
i
can
imagine
several
ways
to
make
the
advertisers
look
like
louts
for
doing
this
which
would
change
positive
market
exposure
to
negative
market
exposure
and
negate
the
space
advertising
advantage
would
you
spend
m
to
look
like
an
idiot
and
light
pollution
might
not
be
too
bad
if
its
in
a
low
enough
orbit
and
it
relies
upon
reflected
light
only
it
would
only
be
visible
for
a
short
time
just
after
local
dusk
and
before
dawn
for
maximum
market
exposure
you
want
to
have
it
visible
just
after
dusk
minimizing
impact
on
astronomy
since
thats
the
time
of
worse
seeing
due
to
daynight
thermal
turbulence
it
might
still
be
a
problem
but
perhaps
there
are
ways
to
mitigate
this
as
for
having
real
funding
none
that
i
can
identify
there
were
about
expressions
of
interest
made
on
the
conestoga
advertising
opportunity
but
that
included
curious
folks
and
was
for
only
a
commitment
i
havent
heard
of
any
serious
funding
for
this
but
im
sure
they
are
shopping
the
venture
around
looking
for
some
money
in
order
to
flesh
out
the
concept
some
more
but
i
am
confident
there
are
no
firm
or
paying
customers
at
this
time
and
if
anybody
wants
to
crosspost
this
to
sciastro
please
be
my
guest
i
dont
have
posting
privileges
to
that
area
or
at
least
i
dont
think
i

more

other

what
was

how
serious
is
this

is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have

funding
well
i
had
been
collecting
data
for
next
edition
of
the
commercial
space
newsspace
technology
investor
to
summarize
space
advertising
first
advertising
on
space
vehicles
is
not
new
it
is
very
common
practice
to
put
the
cooperating
organizations
logos
on
the
space
launch
vehicle
for
example
the
latest
gps
launcher
had
the
very
prominent
logos
on
its
side
of
mcdonnell
douglas
the
delta
launcher
rockwell
international
who
built
the
gps
satellite
usaf
who
paid
for
the
satellite
and
launch
and
the
gpsnavstar
program
office
this
has
not
been
considered
paid
advertising
but
rather
public
relations
since
the
restrictions
have
been
such
that
only
organizations
involved
in
the
launch
could
put
their
logos
on
the
side
and
there
was
no
money
exchanged
for
this
however
putting
a
high
logo
on
the
side
of
the
launch
vehicle
facing
the
cameras
is
advertising
as
much
as
it
is
public
relations
in
my
opinion
and
by
the
way
i
note
that
the
dcx
test
vehicle
has
rather
prominent
mcdonnelldouglas
and
sdio
logos
on
the
side
there
have
been
several
studies
looking
at
the
revenue
potentials
for
use
of
space
vehicles
for
advertising
or
placing
large
advertising
signs
in
orbit
on
the
shuttle
for
example
i
know
of
several
serious
studies
in
the
early
and
mid
which
looked
at
putting
logos
on
the
external
tank
or
on
the
sides
of
the
payload
bay
these
ventures
would
be
different
than
public
relations
in
that
the
logos
or
displays
would
not
be
restricted
to
the
firms
participating
on
that
flight
and
would
involve
payment
of
sums
for
the
right
to
fly
the
logos
in
a
prominent
organization
for
example
painting
the
et
to
look
like
a
pepsi
can
or
putting
a
disneyworld
logo
on
the
inside
of
the
payload
bay
where
the
cameras
would
scan
past
it
adverts
on
launch
vehicles
the
first
paid
advertising
was
done
on
a
soviet
launcher
in
about
when
several
noninvolved
foreign
organizations
were
allowed
to
pay
to
put
their
logos
on
a
proton
launch
an
italian
shoe
company
was
one
of
the
first
advertisers
i
remember
similarly
soviet
cosmonauts
on
mir
made
a
paid
advertisement
for
the
last
olympic
games
and
have
gleefully
shown
banners
and
other
items
from
participating
firms
and
organizations
mars
candy
bars
for
example
got
a
plug
from
orbit
as
a
sponsor
of
the
launch
of
the
british
visiting
cosmonaut
to
mir
now
us
firms
are
starting
to
put
paid
advertisements
on
launch
vehicles
the
upcoming
conestoga
launch
in
june
putting
the
comet
recoverable
payload
capsule
into
orbit
will
have
paid
advertisements
on
the
side
for
arnold
schwarzeneggers
upcoming
movie
the
last
action
hero
besides
the
usual
logos
of
the
participating
organizations
columbia
pictures
has
paid
to
put
ads
on
the
main
fuselage
of
the
missions
conestoga
rocket
its
booster
rockets
and
on
the
comet
payload
which
will
orbit
the
earth
for
one
month
a
concept
for
this
advertising
display
was
published
in
space
news
magazine
a
couple
of
months
ago
as
a
side
note
robert
lorsch
an
advertising
executive
is
talking
about
suing
nasa
he
charges
nasa
with
appropriating
an
idea
he
created
with
the
space
agency
in
to
form
corporate
advertising
sponsorships
on
nasa
spacecraft
as
a
way
to
get
funding
for
the
space
program
lorsch
contends
that
in
selling
advertising
space
on
the
upcoming
comet
nasa
violated
an
agreement
that
it
would
not
use
his
idea
without
him
being
the
exclusive
representative
for
nasa
and
receiving
compensation
this
is
being
disputed
since
the
launch
is
a
commercial
launch
and
nasa
is
receiving
none
of
the
advertising
revenues
but
the
funding
for
the
comet
program
is
coming
from
nasa

in

pat
writes
what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
their
distribution
is
very
isotropic
and
the
intensity
distribution
crudely
speaking
indicates
were
seeing
an
edge
to
the
distribution
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
now
in
the
good
old
days
before
gro
data
it
was
thought
the
gamma
bursters
were
neutron
stars
in
the
galaxy
it
was
expected
that
gro
would
confirm
this
by
either
showing
they
were
a
local
population
within
a
few
hundred
light
years
or
that
they
were
in
the
galactic
halo
mechanism
was
not
known
but
several
plausible
ones
existed
also
to
be
fair
it
was
noted
that
the
brightest
burster
was
probably
in
the
lmc
suggesting
theorists
might
be
wrong
back
then
as
the
sun
is
not
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
a
halo
population
should
show
anisotropy
a
local
disk
population
is
ruled
out
completely
at
this
stage
to
avoid
the
anisotropy
you
have
to
push
the
halo
out
the
energy
then
gets
large
the
mechanism
of
getting
ns
out
that
far
becomes
questionable
and
we
should
start
to
see
for
example
the
andromedas
bursters
the
data
is
consistent
with
either
a
oort
cloud
distribution
but
only
just
but
no
one
can
think
of
a
plausible
source
with
the
right
spectrum
or
it
can
be
a
cosmological
distances
hence
isotropy
and
the
edge
is
the
edge
of
the
universe
if
at
cosmological
distances
you
need
very
high
energy
to
detect
and
a
very
compact
source
for
spectrum
ergo
a
neutron
star
colliding
with
another
neutron
star
or
black
hole
even
then
getting
the
spectrum
is
very
hard
but
conceivable
if
we
know
anything
about
physics
at
that
level
the
bursters
are
not
due
to
quantum
black
holes
or
cosmic
strings
wrong
spectrum
for
one
thing
the
situation
is
further
complicated
by
recent
claims
that
there
are
two
classes
of
sources
in
the
colliding
ns
theyd
actually
probably
fit
relatively
easily
into
the
nsns
and
nsbh
collision
scenarios
respectively
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying
saucers
entering
hyperspace
but
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
that
most
everyone
assumes
that
they
are
colliding
nuetron
stars
or
spinning
black
holes
i
just
wondered
if
any
mechanism
could
exist
and
place
them

having
this

was
the
only
sure
way
to
locate
a
random
burst
with
only
one
detector
one
cannot
locate
a
burst
except
to
say
its
somewhere
in
the
field
of
view
with
two
detectors
one
can
use
the
time
that
the
burst
is
seen
in
each
detector
to
narrow
the
location
to
a
thin
annulus
on
the
sky
with
three
detectors
one
gets
intersecting
annuli
giving
two
possible
locations
if
one
of
these
locations
is
impossible
because
say
the
earth
blocked
that
part
of
the
sky
voila
you
have
an
error
box
batse
by
having
detectors
of
its
own
can
do
its
own
location
determination
but
only
to
within
about
degrees
would
someone
at
gsfc
like
david
like
to
comment
on
the
current
state
of
location
determination
having
inde
pendent
sightings
by
other
detectors
helps
drive
down
the
uncertainty
you

touch

larsonian
astronomy
and
physics
orthodox
physicists
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
in
which
all
of
the
forces
of
the
universe
can
be
explained
with
a
single
set
of
laws
or
equations
but
they
have
been
systematically
ignoring
or
suppressing
an
excellent
one
for
years
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
which
he
calls
the
reciprocal
system
is
built
on
two
fundamental
postulates
about
the
physical
and
mathematical
natures
of
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
in
two
reciprocal
forms
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
developed
a
complete
theoretical
universe
using
various
combinations
of
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
vibrational
rotational
motions
the
concepts
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
and
speeds
in
relation
to
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
called
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
at
each
step
in
the
development
larson
was
able
to
match
objects
in
his
theoretical
universe
with
objects
in
the
real
physical
universe
photons
subatomic
particles
incomplete
atoms

etc
even

not
yet
discovered
then
such
as
exploding
galaxies
and
gammaray
bursts
and
applying
his
theory
to
his
new
model
of
the
atom
larson
was
able
to
precisely
and
accurately
calculate
inter
atomic
distances
in
crystals
and
molecules
compressibility
and
thermal
expansion
of
solids
and
other
properties
of

of
this
is

physicist
dewey
b
larsons
background
physicist
dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
chemical
or
electrical
he
was
about
years
old
when
he
died
in
may
he
had
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
while
trying
to
develop
a
way
to
compute
chemical
properties
based
only
on
the
elements
used
larsons
lack
of
a
fancy
phd
degree
might
be
one
reason
that
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
him
but
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
sometimes
it
takes
a
relative
outsider
to
clearly
see
the
forest
through
the
trees
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
from
his
books
that
he
also
knew
orthodox
physics
and
astronomy
as
well
as
any
physicist
or
astronomer
well
enough
to
point
out
all
their
contradictions
ad
hoc
assumptions
principles
of
impotence
inconsistencies
etc
larson
did
not
have
the
funds
etc
to
experimentally
test
his
theory
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
he
simply
compared
the
various
parts
of
his
theory
with
other
researchers
experimental
and
observational
data
and
in
many
cases
his
explanation
fit
better
a
selfconsistent
theory
is
much
more
than
the
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
have
they
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
that
works
but
have
been
ignoring
one
for
over
years
now
modern
physics
does
not
explain
the
physical
universe
so
well
some
parts
of
some
of
larsons
books
are
full
of
quotations
of
leading
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
who
agree
and
remember
that
epicycles
crystal
spheres
geocentricity
flat
earth
theory
etc
also
once
seemed
to
explain
it
well
but
were
later
proved
conceptually
wrong

super
collider
boondoggle
i
am
against
contruction
of
the
superconducting
super
collider
in
texas
or
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
gross
waste
of
money
and
contribute
almost
nothing
of
scientific
value
most
physicists
dont
realize
it
but
according
to
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
as
described
in
his
books
the
strange
goofy
particles
mesons
hyperons
alleged
quarks
etc
which
they
are
finding
in
existing
colliders
fermi
lab
cern
etc
are
really
just
atoms
of
antimatter
which
are
created
by
the
highenergy
colliding
beams
and
which
quickly
disintegrate
like
cosmic
rays
because
they
are
incompatible
with
their
environment
a
larger
and
more
expensive
collider
will
only
create
a
few
more
elements
of
antimatter
that
the
physicists
have
not
seen
there
before
and
the
physicists
will
be
even
more
confused
than
they
are
now
are
a
few
more
types
of
antimatter
atoms
worth
the
billion
cost
dont
we
have
much
more
important
uses
for
this
wasted
money
another
thing
to
consider
is
that
the
primary
proposed
location
in
texas
has
a
serious
and
growing
problem
with
some
kind
of
fire
ants
eating
the
insulation
off
underground
cables
how
much
poisoning
of
the
ground
and
ground
water
with
insecticides
will
be
required
to
keep
the
ants
out
of
the
supercollider
naming
the
super
collider
after
ronald
reagon
as
proposed
is
totally
absurd
if
it
is
built
it
should
be
named
after
a
leading
particle
physicist
larsonian
antimatter
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
antimatter
is
not
a
simple
case
of
opposite
charges
of
the
same
types
of
particles
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
rates
of
vibrations
and
rotations
of
the
photons
of
which
they
are
made
in
relation
to
the
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
of
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
calls
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
in
larsons
theory
a
positron
is
actually
a
particle
of
matter
not
antimatter
when
a
positron
and
electron
meet
the
rotational
vibrations
charges
and
rotations
of
their
respective
photons
of
which
they
are
made
neutralize
each
other
in
larsons
theory
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
has
three
dimensions
of
time
and
only
one
dimension
of
space
and
exists
in
a
reciprocal
relationship
to
our
material
half
larsonian
relativity
the
perihelion
point
in
the
orbit
of
the
planet
mercury
has
been
observed
and
precisely
measured
to
advance
at
the
rate
of
seconds
of
arc
per
century
seconds
of
this
advance
are
attributed
via
calculations
to
gravitational
perturbations
from
the
other
planets
venus
earth
jupiter
etc
the
remaining
seconds
of
arc
are
being
used
to
help
prove
einsteins
general
theory
of
relativity
but
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
achieved
results
closer
to
the
seconds
than
general
relativity
can
by
instead
using
special
relativity
in
one
or
more
of
his
books
he
applied
the
lorentz
transformation
on
the
high
orbital
speed
of
mercury
larson
totally
rejected
general
relativity
as
another
mathematical
fantasy
he
also
rejected
most
of
special
relativity
including
the
parts
about
mass
increases
near
the
speed
of
light
and
the
use
of
the
lorentz
transform
on
doppler
shifts
those
quasars
with
redshifts
greater
than
really
are
moving
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
motion
is
away
from
us
in
time
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
there
are
three
dimensions
of
time
instead
of
only
one
but
two
of
those
dimensions
can
not
be
measured
from
our
material
half
of
the
physical
universe
the
one
dimension
that
we
can
measure
is
the
clock
time
at
low
relative
speeds
the
values
of
the
other
two
dimensions
are
negligible
but
at
high
speeds
they
become
significant
and
the
lorentz
transformation
must
be
used
as
a
fudge
factor
larson
often
used
the
term
coordinate
time
when
writing
about
this
in
regard
to
mass
increases
it
has
been
proven
in
atomic
accelerators
that
acceleration
drops
toward
zero
near
the
speed
of
light
but
the
formula
for
acceleration
is
acceleration
force
mass
a
fm
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
the
third
factor
force
in
larsons
theory
mass
stays
constant
and
force
drops
toward
zero
force
is
actually
a
motion
or
combinations
of
motions
or
relations
between
motions
including
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
the
expansion
of
the
universe
for
example
is
an
outward
scalar
motion
inherent
in
the
universe
and
not
a
result
of
the
socalled
big
bang
which
is
yet
another
mathematical
fantasy
the
universe
of
motion
i
wish
to
recommend
to
everyone
the
book
the
universe
of
motion
by
dewey
b
larson
north
pacific
publishers
po
box
portland
oregon
pages
indexed
hardcover
it
contains
the
astrophysical
portions
of
a
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
that
author
an
unrecognized
genius
more
than
thirty
years
ago
it
contains
final
solutions
to
most
all
astrophysical
mysteries
including
the
formation
of
galaxies
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
the
true
origin
of
the
background
radiation
cosmic
rays
and
gamma
ray
bursts
and
the
true
nature
of
quasars
pulsars
white
dwarfs
exploding
galaxies
etc
it
contains
what
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
are
all
looking
for
if
they
are
ready
to
seriously
consider
it
with
open
minds
the
following
is
an
example
of
his
theorys
success
in
his
first
book
in
the
structure
of
the
physical
universe
larson
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
larsons
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
an
immediate
related
explanation
for
them
also
gammaray
bursts
astrophysicists
and
astronomers
are
still
scratching
their
heads
about
the
mysterious
gammaray
bursts
they
were
originally
thought
to
originate
from
neutron
stars
in
the
disc
of
our
galaxy
but
the
new
gamma
ray
telescope
now
in
earth
orbit
has
been
detecting
them
in
all
directions
uniformly
and
their
source
locations
in
space
do
not
correspond
to
any
known
objects
except
for
a
few
cases
of
directional
coincidence
gammaray
bursts
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
according
to
page
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
published
in
the
gammaray
bursts
are
coming
from
supernova
explosions
in
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
which
larson
calls
the
cosmic
sector
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
antimatter
and
material
halves
of
the
physical
universe
and
the
way
they
are
connected
together
the
gammaray
bursts
can
pop
into
our
material
half
anywhere
in
space
seemingly
at
random
this
is
why
the
source
locations
of
the
bursts
do
not
correspond
with
known
objects
and
come
from
all
directions
uniformly
i
wonder
how
close
to
us
in
space
a
source
location
would
have
to
be
for
a
gammaray
burst
to
kill
all
or
most
life
on
earth
there
would
be
no
way
to
predict
one
nor
to
stop
it
perhaps
some
of
the
mass
extinctions
of
the
past
which
are
now
being
blamed
on
impacts
of
comets
and
asteroids
were
actually
caused
by
nearby
gammaray
bursts
larsonian
binary
star
formation
about
half
of
all
the
stars
in
the
galaxy
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sun
are
binary
or
double
but
orthodox
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
still
have
no
satisfactory
theory
about
how
they
form
or
why
there
are
so
many
of
them
but
binary
star
systems
are
actually
a
likely
consequence
of
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
i
will
try
to
summarize
larsons
explanation
which
is
detailed
in
chapter
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
and
in
some
of
his
other
books
first
of
all
according
to
larson
stars
do
not
generate
energy
by
fusion
a
small
fraction
comes
from
slow
gravitational
collapse
the
rest
results
from
the
complete
annihilation
of
heavy
elements
heavier
than
iron
each
element
has
a
destructive
temperature
limit
the
heavier
the
element
is
the
lower
is
this
limit
a
stars
internal
temperature
increases
as
it
grows
in
mass
via
accretion
and
absorption
of
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
gradually
reaching
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
lighter
and
lighter
elements
when
the
internal
temperature
of
the
star
reaches
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
iron
there
is
a
type
i
supernova
explosion
this
is
because
there
is
so
much
iron
present
and
that
is
related
to
the
structure
of
iron
atoms
and
the
atom
building
process
which
larson
explains
in
some
of
his
books
better
than
i
can
when
the
star
explodes
the
lighter
material
on
the
outer
portion
of
the
star
is
blown
outward
in
space
at
less
than
the
speed
of
light
the
heavier
material
in
the
center
portion
of
the
star
was
already
bouncing
around
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
because
of
the
high
temperature
the
explosion
pushes
that
material
over
the
speed
of
light
and
it
expands
outward
in
time
which
is
equivalent
to
inward
in
space
and
it
often
actually
disappears
for
a
while
over
long
periods
of
time
both
masses
start
to
fall
back
gravitationally
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
space
now
starts
to
form
a
red
giant
star
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
time
starts
to
form
a
white
dwarf
star
both
stars
then
start
moving
back
toward
the
main
sequence
from
opposite
directions
on
the
hr
diagram
the
chances
of
the
two
masses
falling
back
into
the
exact
same
location
in
space
making
a
single
lone
star
again
are
near
zero
they
will
instead
form
a
binary
system
orbiting
each
other
according
to
larson
a
white
dwarf
star
has
an
inverse
density
gradient
is
densest
at
its
surface
because
the
material
at
its
center
is
most
widely
dispersed
blown
outward
in
time
this
eliminates
the
need
to
resort
to
mathematical
fantasies
about
degenerate
matter
neutron
stars
black
holes
etc
larsonian
solar
system
formation
if
the
mass
of
the
heavy
material
at
the
center
of
the
exploding
star
is
relatively
small
then
instead
of
a
single
white
dwarf
star
there
will
be
several
mini
white
dwarf
stars
revolving
around
the
red
giant
star
but
probably
still
too
far
away
in
threedimensional
time
to
be
affected
by
its
heat
etc
these
will
become
planets
in
chapter
of
the
universe
of
motion
larson
used
all
this
information
and
other
principles
of
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
to
derive
his
own
version
of
bodes
law
black
hole
fantasy
i
heard
that
physicist
stephen
w
hawking
recently
completed
a
theoretical
mathematical
analysis
of
two
black
holes
merging
together
into
a
single
black
hole
and
concluded
that
the
new
black
hole
would
have
more
mass
than
the
sum
of
the
two
original
black
holes
such
a
result
should
be
recognized
by
everyone
as
a
red
flag
causing
widespread
doubt
about
the
whole
idea
of
black
holes
etc
after
reading
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
books
about
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
especially
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
it
is
clear
to
me
that
black
holes
are
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
the
strange
object
at
cygnus
is
just
an
unusually
massive
white
dwarf
star
not
the
black
hole
that
orthodox
astronomers
and
physicists
so
badly
want
to
prove
their
theory
by
the
way
i
do
not
understand
why
so
much
publicity
is
being
given
to
physicist
stephen
hawking
the
physicists
and
astronomers
seem
to
be
acting
as
if
hawkings
severe
physical
problem
somehow
makes
him
wiser
it
does
not
i
wish
the
same
attention
had
been
given
to
physicist
dewey
b
larson
while
he
was
still
alive
widespread
publicity
and
attention
should
now
be
given
to
larsons
theory
books
and
organization
the
international
society
of
unified
science
electromagnetic
propulsion
i
heard
of
that
concept
many
years
ago
in
connection
with
ufos
and
unorthodox
inventors
but
i
never
was
able
to
find
out
how
or
why
they
work
or
how
they
are
constructed
i
found
a
possible
clue
about
why
they
might
work
on
pages
of
the
book
basic
properties
of
matter
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
which
describes
part
of
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
i
quote
one
paragraph
as
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
universe
of
motion
arrives
at
a
totally
different
concept
of
the
nature
of
electrical
resistance
the
electrons
we
find
are
derived
from
the
environment
it
was
brought
out
in
volume
i
larsons
book
nothing
but
motion
that
there
are
physical
processes
in
operation
which
produce
electrons
in
substantial
quantities
and
that
although
the
motions
that
constitute
these
electrons
are
in
many
cases
absorbed
by
atomic
structures
the
opportunities
for
utilizing
this
type
of
motion
in
such
structures
are
limited
it
follows
that
there
is
always
a
large
excess
of
free
electrons
in
the
material
sector
material
half
of
the
universe
most
of
which
are
uncharged
in
this
uncharged
state
the
electrons
cannot
move
with
respect
to
extension
space
because
they
are
inherently
rotating
units
of
space
and
the
relation
of
space
to
space
is
not
motion
in
open
space
therefore
each
uncharged
electron
remains
permanently
in
the
same
location
with
respect
to
the
natural
reference
system
in
the
manner
of
a
photon
in
the
context
of
the
stationary
spatial
reference
system
the
uncharged
electron
like
the
photon
is
carried
outward
at
the
speed
of
light
by
the
progression
of
the
natural
reference
system
all
material
aggregates
are
thus
exposed
to
a
flux
of
electrons
similar
to
the
continual
bombardment
by
photons
of
radiation
meanwhile
there
are
other
processes
to
be
discussed
later
whereby
electrons
are
returned
to
the
environment
the
electron
population
of
a
material
aggregate
such
as
the
earth
therefore
stabilizes
at
an
equilibrium
level
note
that
in
larsons
theory
uncharged
electrons
are
also
massless
and
are
basically
photons
of
light
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
spinning
around
one
axis
at
a
particular
rate
below
the
unit
rate
unit
velocity
is
the
speed
of
light
and
there
are
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
to
the
speed
of
light
according
to
larsons
theory
i
might
have
the
above
and
below
labels
mixed
up
larson
is
saying
that
outer
space
is
filled
with
mass
less
uncharged
electrons
flying
around
at
the
speed
of
light
if
this
is
true
then
the
electromagnetic
propulsion
fields
of
spacecraft
might
be
able
to
interact
with
these
electrons
or
other
particles
in
space
perhaps
giving
them
a
charge
and
mass
and
shooting
them
toward
the
rear
to
achieve
propulsion
in
larsons
theory
an
electrical
charge
is
a
onedimensional
rotational
vibration
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
superimposed
on
the
rotation
of
the
particle
the
paragraph
quoted
above
might
also
give
a
clue
to
confused
meteorologists
about
how
and
why
lightning
is
generated

in

at

from
the
tyuratam
space
center
in
the
kazakhstan
republic
aboard
those
boosters
were
a
new
breed
of
venera
probe
for
the
planet
venus
designated
venera
and
the
probes
were
meant
not
for
landing
yet
more
spherical
craft
on
the
venerean
surface
but
to
radar
map
the
planet
in
detail
from
orbit
to
accomplish
this
task
the
basic
venera
design
was
modified
in
numerous
areas
the
central
bus
core
was
made
one
meter
inches
longer
to
carry
the
two
tons
of
propellant
required
for
braking
into
orbit
double
the
fuel
carried
by
the
venera
and
orbiters
eight
years
earlier
extra
solar
panels
were
added
on
to
give
the
vehicles
more
power
for
handling
the
large
amounts
of
data
which
would
be
created
by
the
radar
imaging
the
dishshaped
communications
antennae
were
also
made
one
meter
larger
to
properly
transmit
this
information
to
earth
atop
the
buses
where
landers
were
usually
placed
were
installed
the
by
by
polyus
v
sidelooking
radar
antennae
the
radar
system
possibly
a
terrainimaging
version
of
the
nuclearpowered
satellites
used
by
the
soviets
for
earth
ocean
surveillance
would
be
able
to
map
venus
surface
at
a
resolution
of
one
to
two
kilometers
to
miles
the
soviet
probes
imaging
parameters
were
a
vast
improvement
over
the
united
states
pioneer
venus
orbiter
which
could
reveal
objects
no
smaller
than
kilometers
miles
in
diameter
and
while
the
veneras
resolution
was
comparable
to
that
of
similar
observations
made
by
the
arecibo
radio
telescope
on
the
island
of
puerto
rico
the
orbiters
would
be
examining
the
northern
pole
of
venus
this
region
was
unobtainable
by
either
arecibo
or
pioneer
venus
and
appeared
to
contain
a
number
of
potentially
interesting
geological
features
worthy
of
investigation
on
october
after
an
interplanetary
journey
of
million
kilometers
million
miles
and
two
midcourse
corrections
venera
fired
its
braking
rockets
over
venus
to
place
itself
in
a
polar
orbit
by
kilometers
by
miles
around
the
planet
completing
one
revolution
every
twentyfour
hours
venera
followed
suit
four
days
later
the
twin
probes
thus
became
venus
first
polarcircling
spacecraft
radar
operations
began
on
october
for
venera
and
october
for
venera
for
up
to
sixteen
minutes
every
orbit
over
the
north
pole
the
probes
would
make
a
radar
sweep
of
the
surface
kilometers
ninety
miles
wide
and
nine
thousand
kilometers
miles
long
the
craft
would
then
head
out
to
the
highest
part
of
their
orbits
over
the
south
pole
to
recharge
their
batteries
and
transmit
the
data
back
to
two
large
soviet
antennae
on
earth
each
strip
of
information
took
eight
hours
to
process
by
computer
by
the
end
of
their
main
missions
in
july
of
the
veneras
had
mapped
million
square
kilometers
million
square
miles
thirty
percent
of
the
entire
planet
venera
and
revealed
that
venus
has
a
surface
geology
more
complex
than
shown
by
pioneer
venus
in
the
late
numerous
hills
mountains
ridges
valleys
and
plains
spread
across
the
landscape
many
of
them
apparently
formed
by
lava
from
erupting
volcanoes
in
the
last
one
billion
years
in
planetary
terms
this
makes
the
venerean
surface
rather
young
hundreds
of
craters
were
detected
as
well
the
largest
of
which
had
to
have
been
created
by
meteorites
planetoids
would
be
a
better
term
here
at
least
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
due
to
venus
very
dense
atmosphere
there
were
some
disagreements
between
us
and
soviet
scientists
on
the
origins
of
certain
surface
features
for
example
the
probes
owners
declared
that
the
wide
crater
at
the
summit
of
high
maxwell
montes
the
tallest
mountain
on
the
planet
was
the
result
of
a
meteorite
impact
american
scientists
on
the
other
hand
felt
the
crater
was
proof
that
maxwell
was
a
huge
volcano
sitting
on
the
northern
continent
of
ishtar
terra
in
any
event
the
us
decided
to
wait
on
making
verdicts
about
venus
until
the
arrival
of
their
own
radar
probe
scheduled
for
later
in
the
decade
originally
named
the
venus
orbiting
imaging
radar
voir
its
initial
design
was
scaled
back
and
the
craft
was
redesig
nated
the
venus
radar
mapper
vrm
eventually
the
machine
would
be
called
magellan
after
the
portuguese
navigator
ferdinand
magellan
circa
this
vehicle
would
map
the
entire
planet
in
even
finer
detail
than
the
veneras
for
the
time
however
the
soviet
probes
maintained
that
distinction
radar
imaging
was
not
the
only
ability
of
the
veneras
bolted
next
to
the
polyus
v
radar
antenna
were
the
omega
altimeter
and
the
fourier
infrared
spectrometer
the
latter
for
measuring
the
worlds
temperatures
the
majority
of
the
areas
covered
registered
about
five
hundred
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
but
a
few
locations
were
two
hundred
degrees
hotter
possibly
indicating
current
volcanic
activity
the
probes
also
found
that
the
clouds
over
the
poles
were
five
to
eight
kilometers
three
to
miles
lower
than
at
the
equator
in
contrast
the
polar
air
above
sixty
kilometers
thirtysix
miles
altitude
was
five
to
twenty
degrees
warmer
than
the
equatorial
atmosphere
at
similar
heights
when
the
main
mapping
mission
ended
in
july
of
there
were
plans
for
at
least
one
of
the
veneras
to
radar
image
the
surface
at
more
southernly
latitudes
unfortunately
this
idea
did
not
come
to
pass
as
the
orbiters
may
not
have
possessed
enough
attitudecontrol
gas
to
perform
the
operation
venera
and
ceased
transmission
in
march
of
leaving
the
soviet
institute
of
radiotechnology
and
electronics
with
six
hundred
kilometers
miles
of
radar
data
tape
to
sort
into
an
atlas
of
twentyseven
maps
of
the
northern
hemisphere
of
venus
venus
by
balloon
for
years
the
thick
atmosphere
of
venus
had
been
a
tempting
target
to
scientists
who
wished
to
explore
the
planets
mantle
of
air
with
balloonborne
instruments
professor
jacques
blamont
of
the
french
space
agency
centre
national
detudes
spatiales
cnes
had
proposed
such
an
idea
as
far
back
as
only
to
have
a
joint
frenchsoviet
balloon
mission
canceled
in
nevertheless
late
in
the
year
such
dreams
would
eventually
come
true
when
two
proton
rockets
were
sent
skyward
on
december
and
the
soviet
union
provided
western
observers
with
the
first
clear
full
views
of
the
booster
which
had
been
launching
every
soviet
venus
probe
since
this
was
but
one
of
many
firsts
for
the
complex
mission
the
unmanned
probes
launched
into
space
that
december
were
named
vega
and
a
contraction
of
the
words
venera
and
gallei
gallei
being
the
russian
word
for
halley
not
only
did
the
spacecraft
have
more
than
one
mission
to
perform
they
also
had
more
than
one
celestial
objective
to
explore
namely
the
comet
halley
this
famous
periodic
traveler
was
making
its
latest
return
to
the
inner
regions
of
the
solar
system
since
its
last
visit
in
since
it
was
widely
believed
that
comets
are
the
icy
remains
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
five
billion
years
ago
scientists
around
the
world
gave
high
priority
to
exploring
one
of
the
few
such
bodies
which
actually
come
close
to
earth
most
comets
linger
in
the
cold
and
dark
outer
fringes
of
the
solar
system
some
like
halley
are
perturbed
by
various
forces
and
fall
in
towards
the
sun
where
they
circle
for
millennia
spewing
out
ice
and
debris
for
millions
of
kilometers
from
the
warmth
of
each
solar
encounter
the
soviet
union
along
with
the
european
space
agency
esa
and
japans
institute
of
space
and
astronautical
science
isas
did
not
wish
to
miss
out
on
this
first
opportunity
in
human
history
to
make
a
close
examination
of
halley
the
esa
would
be
using
the
cylindrical
giotto
probe
to
make
a
dangerously
close
photographic
flyby
of
the
comet
while
japans
first
deep
space
craft
sakigake
pioneer
and
suisei
comet
would
view
halley
from
a
much
safer
distance
scientists
in
the
united
states
also
desired
to
study
the
comet
from
the
vantage
of
a
space
probe
at
one
time
envisioning
a
vessel
powered
by
solar
sails
or
ion
engines
however
government
budget
cuts
to
nasa
canceled
the
american
efforts
the
us
would
have
to
make
do
primarily
with
earthbased
observations
and
the
sharing
of
data
from
other
nations
though
an
instrument
named
the
dust
counter
and
mass
analyzer
ducma
designed
by
chicago
university
professor
john
simpson
was
added
on
the
soviet
mission
in
may
of
the
soviets
answer
to
halley
were
the
vegas
instead
of
building
an
entirely
new
craft
for
the
mission
the
soviets
decided
to
modify
their
venera
bus
design
to
encounter
the
comet
while
performing
an
advanced
venus
mission
along
the
way
as
vega
and
reached
venus
the
buses
would
drop
off
one
landerballoon
each
and
use
the
mass
of
the
shrouded
planet
to
swing
them
towards
comet
halley
much
as
the
us
probe
mariner
used
venus
to
flyby
mercury
eleven
years
earlier
the
soviet
craft
would
then
head
on
to
halley
helping
to
pinpoint
the
location
of
the
comets
erupting
nucleus
for
the
giotto
probe
to
dive
in
only
kilometers
miles
away
in
march
of
as
planned
the
two
vegas
arrived
at
venus
in
june
of
vega
released
its
payload
first
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
lander
making
a
twoday
descent
towards
the
planet
the
craft
touched
the
upper
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
june
sixtyone
kilometers
miles
above
the
venerean
surface
a
small
container
was
released
by
the
lander
which
produced
a
parachute
at
kilometers
miles
altitude
thus
the
first
balloon
probe
ever
to
explore
venus
had
successfully
arrived
one
kilometer
after
the
opening
of
the
parachute
helium
gas
was
pumped
into
the
tefloncoated
plastic
balloon
inflating
it
to
a
diameter
of
meters
feet
dangling
on
a
tether
thirteen
meters
feet
below
was
the
instrument
package
properly
known
as
an
aerostat
the
top
part
of
the
aerostat
consisted
of
a
cone
which
served
as
an
antenna
and
tether
attachment
point
to
the
balloon
beneath
it
was
the
transmitter
electronics
and
instruments
connected
at
the
bottom
was
a
nephelometer
for
measuring
cloud
particles
the
aerostat
was
painted
with
a
special
white
finish
to
keep
at
bay
the
corroding
mist
of
sulfuric
acid
which
permeated
the
planets
atmosphere
the
vega
balloon
was
dropped
into
the
night
side
of
venus
just
north
of
the
equator
scientists
were
concerned
that
the
gas
bag
would
burst
in
the
heat
of
daylight
so
they
placed
it
in
the
darkened
hemisphere
to
give
the
craft
as
much
time
as
possible
to
return
data
this
action
necessitated
that
the
landers
come
down
in
the
dark
as
well
effectively
removing
the
camera
systems
used
on
previous
missions
the
author
wonders
though
if
they
could
have
used
floodlights
similar
to
the
ones
attached
to
venera
and
in
when
soviet
scientists
had
thought
the
planets
surface
was
enshrouded
in
a
perpetual
twilight
due
to
the
permanently
thick
cloud
cover
the
first
balloon
transmitted
for
hours
right
into
the
day
hemisphere
before
its
lithium
batteries
failed
covering
kilometers
miles
the
threat
of
bursting
in
the
day
heat
did
not
materialize
the
vega
balloon
was
stationed
at
a
altitude
after
dropping
ballast
at
fifty
kilometers
thirty
miles
for
this
was
considered
the
most
active
of
the
three
main
cloud
layers
reported
by
pioneer
venus
in
indeed
the
balloon
was
pushed
across
the
planet
at
speeds
up
to
kilometers
miles
per
hour
strong
vertical
winds
bobbed
the
craft
up
and
down
two
to
three
hundred
meters
to
feet
through
most
of
the
journey
the
layers
air
temperature
averaged
forty
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
pressure
was
a
mere
earth
atmosphere
the
nephelometer
could
find
no
clear
regions
in
the
surrounding
clouds
early
in
the
first
balloons
flight
the
vega
lander
was
already
headed
towards
the
venerean
surface
both
landers
were
equipped
with
a
soil
drill
and
analyzer
similar
to
the
ones
carried
on
venera
and
in
however
vega
would
become
unable
to
report
the
composition
of
the
ground
at
its
landing
site
in
rusalka
planitia
the
mermaid
plain
north
of
aphrodite
terra
while
still
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
away
from
landing
a
timer
malfunction
caused
the
drill
to
accidentally
begin
its
programmed
activity
sixteen
kilometers
miles
above
the
surface
there
was
neither
any
way
to
shut
off
the
instrument
before
touchdown
nor
reactivate
it
after
landing
this
was
unfortunate
not
only
for
the
general
loss
of
data
but
also
for
the
fact
that
most
of
venus
was
covered
with
such
smooth
lowlevel
lava
plains
and
had
never
before
been
directly
examined
nevertheless
the
surface
temperature
and
pressure
was
calculated
at
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
earth
atmospheres
respectively
during
the
landers
minutes
of
ground
transmissions
a
large
amount
of
background
infrared
radiation
was
also
recorded
at
the
site
as
had
been
done
when
the
drills
and
cameras
on
venera
and
had
failed
in
december
of
the
soviets
focused
on
the
data
returned
during
the
landers
plunge
through
the
atmosphere
the
frenchsoviet
malachite
mass
spectrometer
detected
sulfur
chlorine
and
possibly
phosphorus
it
is
the
sulfur
possibly
from
active
volcanoes
which
gives
the
venerean
clouds
their
yellowish
color
the
sigma
gas
chromatograph
found
that
every
cubic
meter
of
air
between
an
altitude
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
contained
one
milligram
grain
of
sulfuric
acid
the
vega
data
on
the
overall
structure
of
the
cloud
decks
appeared
to
be
at
odds
with
the
information
from
pioneer
venus
the
case
was
made
even
stronger
by
the
fact
that
vega
results
nearly
matched
its
twin
the
vegas
found
only
two
main
cloud
layers
instead
of
the
three
reported
by
the
us
probes
the
layers
were
three
to
five
kilometers
to
miles
thick
at
altitudes
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
the
clouds
persisted
like
a
thin
fog
until
clearing
at
an
altitude
of
kilometers
miles
much
lower
than
the
pv
readings
one
possibility
for
the
discrepan
cies
may
have
been
radical
structural
changes
in
the
venerean
air
over
the
last
seven
years
when
the
lander
and
balloon
finally
went
silent
the
last
functioning
part
of
the
vega
mission
the
flyby
bus
sailed
on
for
a
millionkilometer
millionmile
journey
around
the
sun
to
become
the
first
probe
to
meet
comet
halley
on
march
the
bus
made
a
pass
at
the
dark
and
icy
visitor
before
traveling
on
in
interplanetary
space
the
soviets
had
accomplished
their
first
mission
to
two
celestial
bodies
with
one

vessel
on

tracking
it
on

for
hours
before
battery

on
the
morning
side
of
the

during
its
flight
over

the
second
balloon
entered
in
a
rather
still
environment
which
became
less
so
twenty
hours
into
the
mission
after
hours
mission
time
the
air
became
even
more
turbulent
for
a
further
eight
hours
when
the
balloon
passed
over
a
five
kilometer
threemile
mountain
on
the
continent
of
aphrodite
terra
a
powerful
downdraft
pulled
the
craft
kilometers
miles
towards
the

temperature
sensors
on
the
vega

reported
that
the
air
layer
it
was
moving
through
was
consistently
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
cooler
than
the
area
explored
by
the
vega
balloon
this
was
corroborated
by
the
vega
lander
as
it
passed
through
the
balloons
level
no
positive
indications
of
lightning
were
made
by
either
balloon
and
the

touched
down
on
the
northern
edge
of
aphrodite

western
arm
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
kilometers
miles
southeast
of
vega
the
landers
resting

was
smoother
than
thought
indicating
either
a
very
ancient
and
worn
surface
or
a
relatively
young
one
covered
in
fresh
lava
the

in

this

a

was
also
present
in

the

essentially
a

very
dark
and
irregularshaped
mass
about
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
rotating
once
every
hours
give
or
take
three
hours
since
both
vega
craft
were
still
functioning
after
their
halley
encounters
soviet
scientists
considered
an
option
to
send
the
probes
to
other
celestial
objects
one
prime
target
was
the
near
earth
planetoid
adonis
which
vega
could
pass
at
a
distance
of
six
million
kilometers
million
miles
sadly
the
soviets
had
to
back
out
on
the
opportunity
to
become
the
first
nation
to
fly
a
spacecraft
past
a
planetoid
when
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
not
enough
maneuvering
fuel
in
the
probe
to
reach
adonis
as
planned
vega
and
were
quietly
shut
down
in
early
future
plans
diverted
the
impressive
vega
mission
had
given
some
scientists
numerous
ideas
and
hope
for
even
more
ambitious
expeditions
to
the
second
world
from
the
sun
one
example
was
the
vesta
mission
planned
for
the
early
this
sovietfrench
collaboration
called
for
the
launch
of
multiple
probes
on
a
single
proton
rocket
in
either
or
the
craft
would
first
swing
by
venus
and
drop
off
several
landers
and
balloon
probes
the
aerostats
would
be
designed
to
survive
in
the
planets
corrosive
atmosphere
for
up
to
one
month
a
large
improvement
over
the
vega
balloons
two
days
the
mission
would
then
head
out
to
investigate
several
planetoids
and
comets
including
a
possible
landing
on
vesta
thus
the
mission
name
the
most
reflective
main
belt
planetoid
as
seen
from
earth
unfortunately
for
venus
exploration
plans
began
to
change
in
the
soviet
union
in
the
soviets
decided
to
reroute
the
vesta
mission
to
the
red
planet
mars
instead
of
venus
keeping
the
comet
and
planetoid
aspects
intact
by
this
time
in
the
soviet
space
program
interest
was
focusing
on
mars
already
under
construction
was
an
entirely
new
probe
design
called
phobos
two
members
of
this
class
were
planned
to
leave
earth
in
and
orbit
mars
the
next
year
phobos
and
would
then
place
the
first
instruments
on
mars
largest
moon
phobos
all
this
was
a
prelude
to
even
more
advanced
mars
expeditions
including
balloon
probes
rovers
soil
sample
return
craft
and
eventually
human
explorers
in
the
early
twentyfirst
century
the
environment
of
venus
was
just
too
hostile
for
any
serious
consideration
of
human
colonization
in
the
near
future
but
things
began
to
look
bleak
for
soviet
venus
and
mars
exploration
both
phobos
probes
failed
to
complete
their
missions
one
losing
contact
on
the
way
to
the
red
planet
in
and
the
other
going
silent
in
mars
orbit
just
one
week
before
the
planned
moon
landing
in
march
of
in
a
plan
was
devised
for
a
venus
orbiter
to
drop
eight
to
ten
penetrators
around
the
planet
in
several
years
later
the
mission
launch
date
was
moved
to
the
year
and
has
now
been
put
on
indefinite
hold
no
other
official
soviet
missions
to
venus
have
since
been
put
forth
a
sad
commentary
after
twentyfive
years
of
continuous
robotic
exploration
of
the
planet
during
the
late
a
drastic
political
and
economic
change
was
taking
over
the
soviet
union
president
mikhail
gorbachev
began
to
open
up
his
nation
to
the
benefits
of
increased
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
nations
particularly
those
in
the
west
while
the
culture
became
less
oppressive
than
in
the
past
the
economy
was
taking
a
very
rough
ride
as
it
also
underwent
the
effects
of
a
free
market
these
effects
hit
everywhere
including
the
space
program
missions
at
all
levels
were
cut
back
the
soviets
began
making
almost
desperate
attempts
to
cooperate
with
other
spacefaring
nations
either
to
keep
their
remaining
programs
alive
or
just
to
make
money
in
early
it
was
reported
that
the
soviets
were
offering
for
sale
several
fullyequipped
veneras
they
had
in
storage
for
the
price
of
million
dollars
each
an
incredibly
low
price
for
any
planetary
probe
no
nation
took
them
up
on
the
bargain
meanwhile
the
united
states
was
gearing
up
for
new
venus
missions
of
their
own
magellan
and
galileo
the
us
reactivated
their
longdormant
planetary
exploration
with
the
launch
of
the
space
shuttle
atlantis
on
may
aboard
the
shuttle
was
the
magellan
spacecraft
a
combination
of
spare
parts
from
other
us
probes
designed
to
make
the
most
detailed
and
complete
radarmapping
of
venus
in
history
when
magellan
reached
the
second
world
in
august
of
it
would
be
able
to
map
almost
the
entire
planet
down
to
a
resolution
of
meters
feet
surpassing
the
abilities
of
venera
and
in
the
interim
another
american
probe
was
launched
from
a
space
shuttle
which
would
make
a
quick
flyby
of
venus
on
its
way
to
orbit
the
giant
planet
jupiter
in
on
october
the
shuttle
atlantis
released
its
second
unmanned
planetary
probe
into
space
named
galileo
after
the
famous
italian
astronomer
who
discovered
the
probes
primary
targets
major
moons
in
in
the
absence
of
a
powerful
enough
booster
to
send
galileo
on
a
direct
flight
to
the
jovian
planet
the
probe
was
sent
around
venus
and
earth
several
times
to
build
up
enough
speed
to
reach
jupiter
as
a
result
venus
became
galileos
first
planetary
goal
in
february
of
the
probe
radioed
back
images
of
the
planets
swirling

and
further
indications

in
that
violent
atmosphere
on
the
drawing
boards
with
the
incredible
success
of
magellan
in
the
last
few
years
new
plans
have
been
laid
out
for
further
journeys
to
venus
scien
tists
in
the
us

talked
to

scientists
in
the
former
soviet
union
now
the
commonwealth
of
independent
states
since
january
of
a
cooperative
effort
to
launch
new
venera
lander
missions
within
in
the
next
decade
japan
india
and
the
esa
have
also
considered
their
own
venus
missions
in
the
next
few
decades
in
february
of
nasa
came
up
with
several
new
venus
projects
as
part
of
their
discovery
program
for
launching
inexpensive
probes
throughout
the
solar
system
for
venus
two
missions
were
selected
for
further
study
a
venus
multiprobe
mission
involving
the
landing
of
fourteen
small
probes
over
one
hemisphere
to
measure
winds
air
temperature
and
pressure
and
the
venus
composition
probe
designed
to
study
venus
atmosphere
while
descending
through
the
thick
air
with
the
aid
of
a
parachute
much
as
the
soviets
had
done
since
final
project
decisions
will
be
made
in
humans
on
venus
will
a
human
ever
be
able
to
stand
on
the
surface
of
venus
at
present
the
leadmelting
temperatures
and
crushing
air
pressure
would
be
threatening
to
any
earth
life
not
protected
in
something
even
tougher
than
a
venera
lander
plans
have
been
looked
into
changing
the
environment
of
venus
itself
into
something
more
like
earths
however
it
should
be
noted
that
any
such
undertaking
will
require
the
removal
of
much
of
the
thick
carbon
dioxide
atmosphere
a
major
reduction
in
surface
heat
and
the
ability
to
speed
up
the
planets
rotation
rate
to
something
a
bit
faster
than
once
every
earth
days
such
a
project
may
take
centuries
if
not
millennia
in
the
meantime
efforts
should
be
made
to
better
understand
venus
as
its
exists
today
we
still
have
yet
to
fully
know
how
a
world
so
seemingly
similar
to
earth
in
many
important
ways
became
instead
such
a
deadly
place
will
earth
ever
suffer
this
fate
perhaps
venus
holds
the
answers
such
answers
may
best
be
found
through
international
cooperation
including
the
nation
which
made
the
first
attempts
to
lift
the
cloudy
veils
from
venus

saw
a

yellowish
trail
in
the
low
northeastern
horizont
the
altitude
of
the
trail
was
only
about
degrees
soon
the
trail
began
to
grow
taller
a
loop
was
appeared
in
the
head
of
the
trail
it
was
like
a
spoon
this
lasted
only
seconds
now
the
altitude
was
about
five

he
noted
a
bright
spot
at
the
upper
stage
of
loop
the
spot
was
at
magnitude
the
loop
became
enlarged
and
the
spot
was
now
visible
in
the
middle
of
the
loop
a
cartwheelshaped
trail
was
appeared
round
the
bright
spot
after
a
minute
the
spot
disappeared
and
only
fuzzy
trails
were
only
visible
in
the
low
horizont
luminous
trails
were
still
visible
at
ut
in

the
phenomenon
was
caused
by

i
dont
know
if
there
were
satellite
launches
in
plesetsk
cosmodrome
near
arkhangelsk
but
this
may
be
a
rocket
experiment
too
since
we
have
observed
over
rocket

in

most
of
these
are
rocket
experiments
military
missile
tests
barium
experiments
and
other

during

better

than

id
buy
that
for
two

the

for

and
radios
if
you

still
find

are
usually

more
expensive
than
comparable
transistors
also
ask
any

which

theyll
tell

since

have
lower

than

course
most
of

just

sound
better

also

have

if
all
of

have
been
detected
in

has
anyone
looked
into
possible
problems
with
the

that
is
is
there
some
mechanism
cosmic

whatever
that
could
cause
the
dector
to
think
it
was
seeing
one
of
these
things
graydon
that
would
not
explain
why
widely
separated
detectors
such
as
on
ulysses
and
pvo
and
ginga
et
al
would
see
a
burst
at
the
same
time
in
fact
be
fore
batse
having
this
widely
separated
interplanetary
network
was
the
only
sure
way
to
locate
a
random
burst
with
only
one
detector
one
cannot
locate
a
burst
except
to
say
its
somewhere
in
the
field
of
view
with
two
detectors
one
can
use
the
time
that
the
burst
is
seen
in
each
detector
to
narrow
the
location
to
a
thin
annulus
on
the
sky
with
three
detectors
one
gets
intersecting
annuli
giving
two
possible
locations
if
one
of
these
locations
is
impossible
because
say
the
earth
blocked
that
part
of
the

voila
you
have

error

by
having

of

like
to
comment
on
the
current
state

determination
having

pendent
sightings
by

helps
drive
down
the
uncertainty
you
did
touch

you
didnt

some

that

features
seen
in

can
actually

peter
peterfoddjobuchicagoedu
all
of
this
is
very
valid
and
very
true
but
to
add
to
this
explaniation
each
individual
detector
also
has
a
built
in
failsafe
just
so
the
detector
does
not
read
the
background
radiationie
cosmic
rays
if
i
remember
right
the
detectors
go
off
about
to
sigma
above
the
background
this
is
so
they
dont
catch
particularly
energetic
cosmic
rays
that
would
normally
set
it
off
even
with
this
buffer
they
still
have
to
throw
out
something

little

i
dont
have
a

i
do
have
the
problem
set
that
we
did
not
too
long
ago
so
ill
use
that
and
hope
its
what
you
wanted
this
is
a
highly
simplified
problem
with
a
very
simple
burst
bursts
are
usually
more
complex
than
this
example
i
will
use
here
our
burst
has
a
peak
flux
of
ergs
and
a
duration
of
seconds
during
the
frst
second
of
the
burst
and
the
last
seconds
its
flux
is
half
of
the
peak
flux
its
flux
is
the
peak
flux
the
rest
of
the
time
assume
that
the
background
flux
is
erg
then
we
had
to
find
the
integrated
luminosity
of
the
burst
for
several
different
spheres
cloud
radius
the
edge
of
the
galaxy
or
the
edge
of
the
galactic
corona
and
lastly
at
a
we
integrated
the
flux
over
all
time
to
find
the
fluence
then
used
the
old
standby
formula
for
a
radius
of
pc
we
found
an
l
around
ergsec
pretty
energetic
for
close
by
for
the
coronal
model
we
found
around
ergsec
and
lastly
for
the
cosmological
model
an
thats
what
youd
call
moderately
energetic
id
say
any
suggestions
about
what
could
put
out
that

remember

an

network
of

with

baseline
that
goes
waaaay

we

able

de
tect

analogy
you
see

you
measure
the

the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrary
coordinate
system
one

sees
the

plane
and
measures
the
angle
from
the
zero
point
of
his
arbitrary
system
which
is
the
same
as
yours
the
two
angles
are
different
and
you
should
be
able
to
triangulate
the
position
of
your
burst
and
maybe
find
a
source
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
been
able
to
do
this
uh
no
these
burst
detectors
are
just
that
burst
detectors
they
have
no
angular
resolution
now
a
network
of
burst
detectors
could
have
angular
resolution
but
we
do
not
have
a
decent
set
of
different

at
the

neccesary
from

other

determine

theyre

the

the
next
key
hurdle
for

data
purchase
act
is
introduction
of
the
act
in
congress
at
this
point
many
congresspersons
have
been
approached
about
the
bill
however
for
a
successful
effort
to
pass
the
bill
we
need
the
best
possible
congressperson
to
introduce
the
bill
due
to
his
position
as
chair
of
the
house
committee
on
space
and
science
congressman
george
brown
is
the
logical
choice
he
has
a
long
record
of
support
and
interest
in
space
development
and
helped
pass
the
launch
services
purchase
act
and
the
space
settlements
act
there
is
a
small
group
of
activists
in
southern
california
who
have
assisted
george
brown
in
his
recent
reelection
campaigns
we
are
mobilizing
this
group
to
have
them
tell
congressman
brown
about
the
back
to
the
moon
bill
we
are
also
asking
prospace
constituents
to
let
him
know
that
they
care
about
getting
america
back
to
the
moon
finally
there
is
a
good
chance
that
a
nationwide
alert
for
space
activists
to
call
or
write
george
brown
to
have
him
introduce
the
back
to
the
moon
bill
may
be
staged
during
late
spring
all
this
should
produce
a
positive
reaction
from
browns
office
as
more
is
known
it
will
be
passed
on
however
even
if
we
are
successful
in
getting
him
to
support
the
bill
this
alone
will
not
ensure
passage
of
the
bill
for
any
bill
to
become
law
one
of
three
conditions
must
exist
either
the
bill
must
reflect
widespread
national
support
for
an
issue
such
as
extension
of
unemployment
insurance
benefits
be
propelled
by
highpriced
lobbyists
were
out
of
luck
there
or
have
widespread
support
within
congress
due
to
small
but
widespread
constituent
support
the
latter
is
the
path
that
we
by
necessity
must
choose
this
means
that
the
introduction
of
the
lunar
resources
data
purchase
act
must
be
immediately
accompanied
by
a
large
number
of
congresspersons
sponsorship
of
the
bill
to
accomplish
this
we
need
activists
to
ask
their
congressperson
to
support
the
lunar
resources
data
purchase
act
now
to
wait
until
the
bill
is
introduced
is
simply
too
late
it
takes
time
to
have
a
congresspersons
staff
review
a
bill
if
your
congressperson
mentions
that
the
bill
is
not
yet
introduced
please
elicit

some
of
what

rooted
in

many

may
never

known
a

where
the

were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
more
on
mans
effect
on
the
environment
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i
think
my
point
about
a
desire
for
beauty
is
valid
even
if
it
cant
ever
be
perfectly
achieved
i
agree
that
the
desire
for
beauty
is
valid
but
i
think
your
desire
to
impose
your
vision
of
beauty
is
not
you
mention
the
ageold
desire
to
somehow
get
up
there
but
ignore
the
beauty
of
the
actual
achievment
of
that
vision
you
mention
the
beauty
of
a
very
dark
sky
not
impeded
by
the
effects
of
humans
but
ignore
the
beauty
of
the
asdarkascanbe
sky
that
is
only
visible
from
space
a
vision
that
we
or
at
least
our
descendents
may
one
day
be
able
to
see
in
part
because
of
efforts
that
others
call
ugly
one
day
i
hope
humans
will
be
able
to
look
out
not
upon
half
the
heavens
with
only
naturecreted
lights
but
upon
all
of
the
heavens
with
no
lights
if
advertising
in
space
can
help
us
reach
that
goal
it
is
no
less
beautiful
for
the
way
we
reach
it
than
the
pristine
sky
of
yesteryear
or
yestercentury
which
is
totally
unreachable
one
of
the
original
conceptions
of
beauty
in
wetsern
sculpture

theres

i
would
appreciate
any
thoughts
on
what
makes
a
planet
habitable
for
humans
i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a
similar
atmosphere
evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth
like
conditions
eg
temperature
range
of
to
where
temp
is
purely
dependant
on
dist
from
the
sun
and
the
suns
temperature
atmospheric
presure
i
know
nothing
of
human
tolerance
there
are
people
who
have
adapted
to
high
altitudes
in
the
andes
and
in
tibet
i
suspect
that
it
took
them
several
generations
to
make
the
adaptation
because
europeans
had
difficulty
making
the
adaptation
they
had
to
send
the
women
to
a
lower
altitude
when
they
were
pregnant
in
order
to
insure
sucessful
childbirth
planetary
mass
again
gravity
at
surface
is
important
how
much
can
human
bodies
take
day
after

also
how
does
the

effect
atmosphere
i
thinking
of
planets
between
and
times
mass
of
the
earth
i
suppose
density
should
be
important
as
well
another
factor
you
should
consider
is
the
xray
opacity
of
the
atmosphere
in
case
of
stellar
flares
the
uv
opacity
is
also
important
because
uv
radiation
can
kill
or
damage
microbes
plants
and
animals
climate
etc
does
not
concern
me
nor
does

a
station
that
meets

goals
and
has
identified
three
distinct
phases
of

power
station
human

and
permanent

the
team
will
define
the
minimum
capability
needed
to
achieve
each
phase
the
total
cost
of
each
phase
and
the
achievable
capability
for
budget
levels
the

uses
current

other
existing

i
was

the

have
the
right
to
a
dark
uncluttered

sorry
you
have
a
wish
for
an
uncluttered
night
sky
but
it
isnt
a
right
when
you
get
down
to
it
you
actually
have
no
rights
that
the
majority
havent
agreed
to
give
you
and
them
in
the
process
its
a
common
misconception
that
being
born
somehow
endows
you
with
rights
to
this
that
and
the
other
sadly
this
is
not
true
now
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
responsibility
that
should
go
with
the
power
to
clutter
the
night
sky
then
thats
a
different
matter
greg
nicholls
vidi
nichovnetibmcom
or
vici
nichoolympusdemoncouk
veni
according
to
this
reasoning
there
are
no
rights
at
least
none
that
i
can
think
of
lets
see
do
i
have
a
right
to
unpolluted
air
no
because
the
majority
drive
cars
and
use
goods
that
create
air
pollution
in
the
manufacturing
process
do
i
have
the
right
to
clean
water
i
guess
not
by
the
same
reasoning
i
could
go
on
with
these
examples
for
a
long
time
look
at
nazi
germany
because
of
the
majority
jews
homosexuals
blacks
and
others
that
were
different
had
no
rights
in
fact
they
were
terrorized
imprisoned
and
slaughtered
in
this
country
did
blacks
have
the
right
to
be
free
from
slavery
i
guess
not
because
the
majority
said
that
slavery
was
good
for
them
i
think
that
a
right
has
a
moral
imperative
if
a
law
imposed
by
the
majority
is
immoral
one
should
not
follow
it
in
fact
one
should
do
everything
in
hisher
power
to
stop
it
of
course
that
doesnt
mean
that
i
would
lose
all
common
sense
to
break
the
law
just
because
i
thought
it
was
immoral
i
pay
my
federal
income
tax
even
though
i
am
morally
opposed
to
the
us
government
taking
my
money
and
spending
it
on
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
terrorism
this
is
precisely
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
we
should
persude
people
by
logic
pointing
out
that
it
is
in
their
selfinterest
to
let
all
have
equal
rights
in
all
aspects
of
life
including
adequate
housing
food
and
medical
care
i
just
happen
to
think
that
for
a
full
life
the
aesthetic
of
beauty
and
joy
is
also
necessary
that
is
why
i
consider
an
uncluttered
night
sky
a
right
have
you
ever
been
out
in
the
desert
away
from
local
lights
and
most
people
the
sky
is
dark
and
transparent
the
milky
way
is
ablaze
with
more
detail
than
you
thought
possible
the
beauty
and
wonder
takes
your
breath
away
now
imagine
you
live
in
the
worst
ghetto
say
in
la
due
to
light
pollution
you
have
never
seen
a
dark
sky
you
might
in
fact
never
not
in
your
whole
life
ever
see
the
majesty
of
the
night
sky
every
where
around
you
you
see
squalor
and
through
your
life
runs
a
thread
of
dispair
what
is
there
to
live
for
i
admit
these
two
scenarios
are
extreme
examples
but
i
have
seen
both
i
for
one
need
dreams
and
hopes
and
yes
beauty
as
a
reason
for
living
that
is
why
i
consider
an
uncluttered

my
apologies
if
this
is
a
repost
i
submitted
it
on
friday
but
got
a
message
that
my
post
might
not
have
gone
out
considering
the
confusing
spitting
contest
over

there
are
too
inalienable
rights
damn
it
the

can
be
just
as
destructive
of
liberty
as
a

i
suspect
that
my

did
not
get
out
of
my

i
aint
saying
that
dark
skies
are
included
in
these
rights
although
we
can
only
preserve
any
rights
by
exercising
them
anyway
here
are
my
thoughts
on
this
id
like
to
add
that
some
of
the
protests
do
not
come
from
a
strictly
practical
consideration
of
what
pollution
levels
are
acceptable
for
research
activities
by
professional
astronomers
some
of
what
i
would
complain
about
is
rooted
in
aesthetics
many
readers
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heavens
were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
the
effect
of
the
first
sputniks
and
echo
etc
on
this
view
could
only
happen
once
to
see
a
light
crossing
the
night
sky
and
know
it
was
put
there
by
us
puny
people
is
still
impressive
and
the
sense
of
size
one
gets
by
assimilating
the
scales
involved
is
also
awesome
even
if
the
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
involved
is
still
dwarfed
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
there
is
still
a
hunger
for
the
pure
beauty
of
a
virgin
sky
yes
i
know
aircraft
are
almost
always
in
sight
i
have
to
live
in
a
very
populated
area
miles
from
an
international
airport
currently
where
light
pollution
on
the
ground
is
ghastly
the
impact
of
humans
is
so
extreme
here
virtually
no
place
exists
that
has
not
been
shaped
sculpted
modified
trashed
or
whipped
into
shape
by
the
hands
of
man
in
some
places
the
only
life
forms
larger
than
bacteria
are
humans
cockroaches
and
squirrels
or
rats
i
visited
some
friends
up
in
the
appalacian
mountains
one
weekend
getting
away
from
it
all
paved
roads
indoor
plumbing
malls
and
it
felt
good
for
a
while
then
i
quickly
noticed
the
hollow
was
directly
under
the
main
flight
path
into
dulles
miles
to
the
east
their
security
light
didnt
help
matters
much
either
but
ive
heard
the
artic
wilderness
gets
lots
of
high
air
traffic
so
i
know
the
skies
are
rarely
perfect
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i
mean
theyve
been
trying
this
forever
like

wow
i
dont
watch

but
i
can
imagine
just
how
disgusting

ointment
advertisements
would
be
if
seen
up
so
high
if
ya
gotta
make
a
buck
on
it
displaying
products
in
heaven
at
least
consider
the
reactions
from
those
for
whom
the
sky
is
a
last
beautiful
refuge
from
the
baseness
of
modern
life
to
be
open
about
this

have

my

this

tonight

it

ill
be

see
it
if
i
can
it
is
my

after
all
so
i
suppose
i
could
be
called
an
elitist
for
supporting
this
intrusion
on
the

while
complaining

that

subject
re
vandalizing
the
sky
i
didnt
want
to
quote
all
the
stuff
thats
been
said
recently
i
just
wanted
to
add
a
point
the
whole
question
of
a
right
to
a
dark
sky
revolves
around
the
definition
of
a
right
moral
rights
and
natural
rights
are
all
well
and
good
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
a
right
is
whatever
you
or
someone
representing
you
can
enforce
in
most
civilizations
the
government
or
the
church
or
both
defines
what
the
rights
of
the
citizens
are
and
then
enforces
those
rights
for
them
here
in
the
us
the
constitution
provides
a
bill
of
rights
from
which
most
if
not
all
legal
rights
are
considered
to
derive
im
sure
that
most
other
countries
have
comparable
documents
if
you
can
persuade
a
court
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
dark
sky
derived
in
some
manner
from
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
us
you
can
prevent
maybe
these
billboards
from
being
launched
to
keep
anyone
in
the
world
from
launching
then
gets
into
international
law

subject
re

counntries
do
space
surveillance
the
european
space
agency
has
involvement
with
remote
earth
observation
and
i
presume
this
includes
surveillance
optical
etc
so
its
not
just
the
usussrex
who
are
in
the
game
but
what
is
the
game
what
can
be
done
with
space
observation
the
military
functions
of
missile
spotting
troop
spotting
etc
are
well
documented
but
what
about
anything
else
the
biggest
eg
i
can
think
of
is
to
get
a
metal
sensing
sat
over
a
paying
country
and
scan
their
territory
for
precious
metals
more
importantly
if
radar
can
spot
water
vapour
clouds
presumably
a
radar
based
sat
will
be
capable
of
spotting
riversopen
water
and
underground
water
from

this
would
be
a
positive

clean

would
be

benifit

how
about

subject
words
from
the
chairman
of
boeing
on
ssto
type
stuff
yesterday
i
went
to
the
boeing
shareholders
meeting
it
was
a
bit
shorter
than
i
expected
last
year
when
the
stock
was
first
down
they
made
a
big
presentation
on
the
and
other
programs
this
year
it
was
much
more
barebones
in
any
case
i
wanted
to
ask
a
question
that
the
board
of
directors
would
hear
and
so
i
got
there
early
and
figured
that
if
i
didnt
get
to
the
mike
maybe
they
would
read
mine
off
of
a
card
and
so
i
wrote
it
down
and
handed
it
in
after
the
meeting
started
mr
shrontz
said
that
he
would
only
answer
written
questions
in
order
to
be
fair
to
the
people
in
the
overflow
room
that
only
had
monitors
downstairs
naturally
i
was
crushed
so
when
question
and
answer
time
came
i
was
suprised
to
find
my
question
being
read
and
answered
admittedly
near
the
end
of
the
ones
that
he
took
presumably
getting
there
early
and
getting
the
question
in
early
made
all
the
difference
so
on
to
the
substance
the
question
was
is
boeing
looking
at
anything
beyond
the
high
speed
civil
transport
such
as
a
commercial
space
launch
system
and
if
not
how
will
boeing
compete
with
the
reusable
single
stage
to
orbit
technology
presently
being
developed
by
mcdonnell
douglass
well
he
read
it
without
a
hitch
and
without
editing
with
impressed
me
then
he
answered
it
very
quickly
treating
it
as
a
two
part
question
last
part
first
this
is
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
what
he
said
as
far
as
single
stage
to
orbit
technology
we
think
that
we
have
a
better
answer
in
a
two
stage
approach
and
we
are
talking
to
some
of
our
customers
about
that
as
far
as
commercialization
that
is
a
long
ways
off
the
high
speed
civil
transport
is
about
as
far
out
as
our
commercial
planning
goes
at
this
point
so
this
tells
me
that
boeing
still
considers
space
to
be
a
noncommercial
arena
and
for
the
most
part
this
is
true
however
it
also
tells
me
that
they
consider
there
to
be
enough
money
in
building
space
launchers
for
them
to
persue
work
on
their
own
now
i
do
have
a
friend
on
the
spacelifter
program
at
boeing
actually
this
is
a
misnomer
as
there
is
no
spacelifter
contract
for
the
work
that
this
guy
is
doing
however
he
is
doing
work
in
preparation
of
a
proposal
for
space
lifter
contracts
he
wont
tell
me
what
he
is
doing
but
maybe
this
is
where
the
tsto
action
is
taking
place
at
boeing
at
the
very
minimum
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
boeing
said
that
they
have
an
approach
in
mind
and
they
are
trying
to
do
something
with
it
anybody
know
anything
further

then
enforces
those

here
in

the

provides
a

most

have
these
seem

to

all
legitimate
power
to

these

derives
from
the

we

what
i

was
not
which

was
which

dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
with
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
the
theory
described
in
his
books
while
trying
to
find
a
way
to
mathematically
calculate
the
properties
of
chemical
compounds
based
only
on
the
elements
they
contain
the
universe
of
motion
describes
the
astrophysical
portions
of
larsons
consistent
integrated
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
a
kind
of
grand
unified
field
theory
that
orthodox
physicists
and
astrophysicists
claim
to
be
looking
for
it
is
built
on
two
postulates
about
the
physical
and
mathematical
nature
of
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
with
two
reciprocal
aspects
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
primary
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
was
able
to
build
a
complete
theoretical
universe
from
photons
and
subatomic
particles
to
the
giant
elliptical
galaxies
by
combining
the
concept
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
with
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
rotational
vibrational
motions
at
each
step
in
the
development
he
was
able
to
match
parts
of
his
theoretical
universe
with
corresponding
parts
in
the
real
physical
universe
including
even
things
not
yet
discovered
for
example
in
his
book
he
first
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
a
related
explanation
ready
for
those
also
as
a
result
of
his
theory
which
he
called
the
reciprocal
system
larson
totally
rejected
many
of
the
sacred
doctrines
of
orthodox
physicists
and
astrophysicists
including
black
holes
neutron
stars
degenerate
matter
quantum
wave
mechanics
as
applied
to
atomic
structure
nuclear
physics
general
relativity
relativistic
mass
increases
relativistic
doppler
shifts
nuclear
fusion
in
stars
and
the
big
bang
all
of
which
he
considered
to
be
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
he
was
very
critical
of
the
ad
hoc
assumptions
uncertainty
principles
solutions
in
principle
no
other
way
declarations
etc
used
to
maintain
them
the
universe
of
motion
is
divided
into
chapters
it
begins
with
a
description
of
how
galaxies
are
built
from
the
gravitational
attraction
between
globular
star
clusters
which
are
formed
from
intergalactic
gas
and
dust
clouds
that
accumulate
from
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
coming
in
from
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
galaxy
formation
from
the
mythical
big
bang
is
a
big
mystery
to
orthodox
astronomers
he
then
goes
on
to
describe
life
cycles
of
stars
and
how
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
result
from
type
i
supernova
explosions
of
single
stars
several
chapters
are
devoted
to
quasars
which
according
to
larson
are
denselypacked
clusters
of
stars
that
have
been
ejected
from
the
central
bulges
of
exploding
galaxies
and
are
actually
traveling
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
speed
is
away
from
us
in
time
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
who
run
up
against
observations
that
contradict
their
theories
would
find
larsons
explanations
quite
valuable
if
considered
with
an
open
mind
for
example
they
used
to
believe
that
gamma
ray
bursts
originated
from
pulsars
which
exist
primarily
in
the
plane
or
central
bulge
of
our
galaxy
but
the
new
gamma
ray
telescope
in
earth
orbit
observed
that
the
bursts
come
from
all
directions
uniformly
and
do
not
correspond
with
any
visible
objects
except
for
a
few
cases
of
directional
coincidence
larsons
explanation
is
that
the
gamma
ray
bursts
originate
from
supernova
explosions
in
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
which
larson
calls
the
cosmic
sector
because
the
antimatter
universe
exists
in
a
reciprocal
relation
to
our
material
universe
with
the
speed
of
light
as
the
boundary
between
them
and
has
three
dimensions
of
time
and
only
one
dimension
of
space
the
bursts
can
pop
into
our
material
universe

ill
have
to
boil

down
a

all
the

shows
a

distribution
that
means
they
arent
concentrated
in

our
or
someone
elses
if
the
distribution
is
smooth
we
are
either
seeing
some
enormously

scattered
at

said
phenomena
being

to

almost
as
vioent
as
the

or
we
are
seeing
some
phenomena
out
at
like
the

but
then
it
needs
some
potent
little
energy
source
that
isnt
detectable
by
any
other
current
methods
we
know
its
not
real
close
like
slightly
extra
solar
because
we
have
no

measurements
on
the

the
bursts
seem
to
bright
to
be

something

everyone

around
there
will

makes

which
thermalizes

has
trouble
generating
enough
energy
to
explain
the
most
powerful
bursts
ergs
it
happens
too
fast
compared
to
the
burst
duration
and
it
is
hard
to
make
tightbinaries
of
neutron

another
cosmological
mechinism
is
the
catalytic
conversion
of
a
neutron
star
to
a
strange
star
or
the
merger
of
two
strange
stars
but
that
uses
pretty
farout
physics
my
point
is
that
we
dont
have
a
good
mechanism
at
any
distance
so
grbs
are
likely
to
be
happening
by
an
unknown
mechanism
so
we
cant
rule
out
the
oort
cloud
what
would
be
the
spectrum
of
an
event
which
converts
a
comet
to
strange
matter
the
spectra
for
primordial
black
holes
eating
comets
and
antimatter
comets
colliding
with
matter
comets
arent
quite
right
but
perhaps
there
is
an
unusual
mechanism
which
modifies
the
spectrum
the
energy
matches
very
well
for
both
of
these
mechanisms
according
to
trevor
weeks
if
the
tunguska
meteorite
was
a
miniblack
hole
collision
with
the
earth
then
there
are
likely
to
be
enough
miniblack
holes
around
that
the
rate
for
bhcomet
collisions
matches
the
grb
rate
well
the
fact
that
we
dont
know
the
distribution
of
comets
in
the
oort
cloud
isnt
a
reason
to
rule
them
out
it
makes
it
harder
to
rule
them
out
the
point
of
the
cited
paper
was
that
if
we
assume
they
got
the
right
distribution
for
the
oort
cloud
it
is
hard
but
not
impossible
to
match
that
up
with
the
distribution
of
grbs
if
they
got
the
wrong
distribution
for
the
oort
cloud
they
cant
constrain
any

here
the

three

that

so
positional

are
limited
by
craft

the

of
the

batse
is
an
altogether
different
beast
effectively
just
coincidence
counters

on

of

positional
information
is
triangulated
from
the
differential
signal
arrival
times
at
each

the

positional
error
would
be
predominantly
determined
by
timing
errors
and
errors
in
craft
attitude
since
none
of
the
baste
detectors
have
any
independant
angular
resolution
whatsoever
they
can
not
be
used
to
determine
parallax
indeed
parallax
would
just
add
a
very
small
component
to
the
positional
error
demonstrating
that
these
puppies
are
beyond
the
oort
cloud
would
require
resolution
on
the
order
of
arcseconds
since
the
oort
cloud
is
postulated
to
extend
to
about
parsec
all
together
now
parallax
arc
second
a
parsec
is
the
distance
of
an
object
that
demonstrates
one
arc
second
of
parallax
with
a
au

if
the

accuracy
reported

is
true
were
going
to
have
to
add
a
baste
to
the
pluto
fast
flyby
to
get
enough
baseline
the
beauty
of
baste
is
that
it
both
gives
positional
information

watches
the
entire
sky

realy
handy
combination

this

the
huge
annulus
created
by
it
will
hopefully
intersect
the

circle
given

we

just

henry
if
i
read
you
correctly
you
may
be
asking
if
i
put
a
blackbody
in
interstellar
space
disregarding
the
sun
and
nearby
large
warm

what
termperature
will
it
reach
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
the
ambient
radiation
field
if
thats
the
case
let
me
point
out
that
interstellar
dust
and
molecules
provide
many
instances
of
things
that
are
well
nottoofar
from
being
blackbodies
many
different
observations
including
iras
and
cobe
have
determined
that
interstellar

denouncing

him
taking

to
modify
the

with
a

however
seriously
it
is
possible
to
limit
the
effects
of
streetlights
by
adding
a
reflector
so
that
the
light
only
illuminates
the
ground
which
is
after
all
where
you
need
it
as
a
bonus
the
power
consumption
required
for

is
reduced
strangely
enough

often
seek
to
lobby
elected
local

to
use
such
lighting
systems
with
considerable
success
in
the
desert

around
the
major
us
observatories
at

thats
what
mcnally
told
us
all
those
years
ago
british
local

couldnt
care
less
as
far
as
i
can

i
suppose
that
the
right

is
no

than
an
aspiration

it

i

any
thoughts
on
what
makes
a
planet
habitable
for
humans
i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a

evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth
like
conditions
this
is
a
good
question
there
are
major
blind
spots
in
our
understanding
of
what
makes
the
earth
habitable
for
example
why
does
the
earths
atmosphere
have
the
concentration
of
oxygen
it
does
the
naive
answer
is
photosynthesis
but
this
is
clearly
incomplete
photosynthesis
by
itself
cant
make
the
atmosphere
oxygenated
as
the
oxygen
produced
is
consumed
when
the
plants
decay
or
are
eaten
what
is
needed
is
photosynthesis
plus
some
mechanism
to
sequester
some
fraction
of
the
resulting
reduced
material
on
earth
this
mechanism
is
burial
in
seafloor
sediments
of
organic
matter
mostly
from
oceanic
sources
however
this
burial
requires
continental
sediments
in
the
deep
ocean
the
burial
rate
is
so
slow
that
most
material
is
consumed
before
it
can
be
sequestered
this
suggests
that
a
planet
without
large
oceans
or
a
planet
without
continents
undergoing
weathering
will
have
a
hard
time
accumulating
an
oxygen
atmosphere
in
particular
an
allocean
planet
may
have
a
hard
time
supporting
an
oxygen
atmosphere
there
is
also
the
problem
of
why
the
oxygen
in
the
earths
atmosphere
has
been
relatively
stable
over
geological
time
for
a
period
at
least
orders
of
magnitude
longer
than
the
decay
time
of
atmospheric
to
weathering
in
the
absence
of
replenishment
no
convincing
feedback
mechanism
has
been
identified
perhaps
the
reason
is
the
weak
anthropic
principle
if
during
the
last
myr
or
so
the
oxygen
level
had
dropped
too
low
we
wouldnt
be
here
to
be

it

i
have
never
heard
of
any
serious
consideration
that
hst
might
be
brought
down
for
refurbishment
you
would
have
the
horrendous
cost
of
transporting
back
in
january
and
february
there
were
several
articles
wash
post
time
saying
that
nasa
was
considering
the
option
just
as
it
is
now
considering
a
followup
mission
months
after
the
servicing
mission
however
the
down
time
was
estimated
to
be
a
year
servicing
checkout
sceheduling
and
training
another
shuttle

and
to
be
quite
expensive
i
think
it
may
have
been
more

than
a

some

i

such

they

full
of

and
put
a

rat
in

since
the

the

it
was
held

the

struggled
quite

it

held

that

it

this
text
is
a
history
of
the
spaceship
as
both
a
cultural
and
a
technological
phenomenon
the
idea
of
a
vehicle
for
traversing
the
space
betwen
worlds
did
not
spring
fullblown
into
existence
in
the
tlatter
half
of
theis
century
the
need
preceded
the
ability
ot
make
such
a
device
by
several
hundred
years
as
soon
as
it
was
realized
that
there
were
other
worlds
than
this
one
human
beings
wanted
to
reach
them
tracing
the
history
of
the
many
imaginative
and
often
prescient
attempts
to
solve
this
problem
also
reflects
the
history
of
technology
science
astronomy
and
engineering
once
space
travel
became
feasible
there
were
many
more
spacecraft
concepts
developed
than
ever
got
off
the
drawing
board
or
off
the
ground
for
that
matter
these
also
are
described
in
theis
book
for
the
same
reason
as
the
prespaceage
and
preflight
ideas
are
they
are
all
accurate
reflections
of
their
particular
eras
dreams
abilities
and
knowledge
virtually
every
spaceship
concept
invented
since
as
well
as
selected
events
important
in
developing
the
idea
of
extraterrestrial
travel
is
listed
chronologically
the
chronological
entries
allow
comparisons
between
actual
astronautical
events
and
speculative
ventures
they
also
allow
comparisons
between
simultaneous
events
taking
place
in
different
countries
they
reveal
connections
influences
and
evolutions
hitherto
unsuspected
every
entry
is
accompanied
by
at
least
one
illustration
nearly
every
spacecraft
concept
is
illustrated
with
a
schematic
drawing
this
allows
accurate
comparisons
to
be
made
between
designss
to
visualize
differences
similarities
and
influences
this

will
be
of
interest
to
students
of

my
advisor
another
classmate
of
mine
and
me
were
talking
the
other
day
about
putting
just
one
detector
on
one
of
the
pluto
satellites
then
we
realized
that
the
satellite
alone
is
only
carrying
something
like
pounds
of
eq
well
a
batse
detector
needs
lead
shielding
to
protect
it
and
alone
weighs
about
pounds
itself
actually
the
situation
is
even
worse
than
that
the
total
mass
of
the
pluto
fast
flyby
spacecraft
is
only
pounds
and
most
of
that
is
support
equipment
like
power
and
communications
the
mass
available
for
instruments
is
maybe
of
that
i
dont
think
a
batse
will
fit
actually
would
you
need
the
shielding
my
understanding
is
that
its
mostly
there
to
give
the
detectors
some
directionality
no
point
in
doing
that
if
youve
only
got
one
im
sure
the
burst
detectors
that
have
flown
on
other
deepspace
missions
havent
weighed
that
much
mind
you
theyre
probably
still
too
heavy

people
would
put

the

one

the

would

i
believe
that

we
need

our

such

i

there

here
the

three

are
focusing
instruments
that

so
positional
errors
are
limited
by
craft

the

of
the
optics
batse
is
an
altogether
different
beast
effectively
just
coincidence
counters
one
on

corner
of
the
craft
positional
information
is
triangulated
from
the
differential
signal
arrival
times
at
each

the

positional
error
would
be
predominantly
determined
by
timing
errors
and
errors
in
craft
attitude
since
none
of
the
baste
detectors
have
any
independant
angular
resolution
whatsoever
they
can
not
be
used
to
determine
parallax
indeed
parallax
would
just
add
a
very
small
component
to
the
positional
error
demonstrating
that
these
puppies
are
beyond
the
oort
cloud
would
require
resolution
on
the
order
of
arcseconds
since
the
oort
cloud
is
postulated
to
extend
to
about
parsec
all
together
now
parallax
arc
second
a
parsec
is
the
distance
of
an
object
that
demonstrates
one
arc
second
of
parallax
with
a
au
base
line
if
the
degree
accuracy
reported

is
true
were
going

have
to
add
a
baste
to
the
pluto
fast
flyby

baseline
the
beauty
of
baste
is
that
it

why

and
the

here
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
big
issue
but
it
seems
to
me
like
it
might
be
up
till
now
all
forces
applied
to
the
mirror
and
its
mounting
and
nearly
all
forces
have
been
applied
along
the
telescopes
optical
axis
and
against
the
mirrors
base
reentry
would
apply
forces
along
roughly
the
same
axis
but
tending
to
pull
the
mirror
away
from
the
mount
and
the
landing
would
apply
onedge
forces
to
both
the
mirror
and
mount
it
could
be
that
one
or
both
of
these
would

what
batse
actually
does
is
measure
the

in

also
as
a
function
of
photon
energy
each
of
the

does
not
have

to
do
this
right
one
must
model
the

in

around

even

what

the

some

the

it

partly
to

like
some

on

the
mental

is
usually
induced
by
a

the

the

that
the

the
problem

absolutely

as
far
as
i
can
tell
closest

conventional
oort

is
a

its
got
too
many

in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
was
a
good
try
so
you
have
a
plausible
model
for
grbs
at
astronomical
distances
recent
observations
have
just
about
ruled
out
the
merging
neutron
star
hypothesis
which
had
a
lot
of
problems
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implausible
models
and
what
is
fundamentally
allowed
independent
of
models
a
paper
on
the
possibility
of
grbs
in
the

just

line
get
here
is
the
abstract
of
that
paper
the
currently
favored
explanation
for
the
origin
of
grbs
puts
them
at
cosmological
distances
but
as
long
as
there
is
no
distance
indicator
to
these
events
all
possible
sources
which
are
isotropically
distributed
should
remain
under
consideration
this
is
why
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no
known
mechanism
for
generating
grbs
from
cometary
nuclei
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
the
possibility
that
grbs
originate
in
the
solar
cometary
cloud
cannot
be
excluded
until
it
is
disproved
we
use
the
available
data
on
the
distribution
of
grbs
the
batse
catalogue
up
to
march
and
the
catalogue
of
cometary
orbits
by
marsden
and
williams
to
investigate
whether
there
is
any
observational
indication
for
correlations
between
the
angular
distributions
of
grbs
and
comets
aphelia
assuming
that
the
distribution
of
aphelia
direction
reflect
at
least
to
some
extent
true
variations
in
the
column
density
of
the
oort
cloud
we
also
apply
the
vov
test
to
both
distributions
we
have
performed
a
variety
of
statistical
tests
a
kolmogorovsmirnov
test
for
the
distributions
in
galactic
latitude
a
test
for
the
spherical
multiple
moments
and
a
crosscorrelation
analysis
including
testing
subsamples
for
isolating
the
effect
of
possible
observational
biases
these
tests
imply
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
two
distributions
agree
but
the
statistical
significance
is
not
sufficient
for
ruling
out
any
connection
with
complete
confidence
we
performed
montecarlo
simulations
which
show
that
only
when
the
number
of
bursts
exceeds
sim
it
is
possible
to
rule
out
a
correlation
between
the
angular
distributions
currently
it
is
only
the
combination
of
these
tests
with
the
large
disagreement
found
for
the
vov
parameter
which
makes
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
unlikely
to
be
related

re

does
anyone
have
a

something
i

your

i
have
a

of

myself

as

note
i
am

there
are
more
things
in

than
just
the

what
im

is
total
blackbody
temperature
what
a
thermal
radiator
would
see
disregarding
or
shielding
against
the
sun
and
nearby
large
warm
objects
im
not
sure
if
this
will
help
you
but
the
local
interstellar
radiation
field
has
been
measured
and
modeled
by
various
groups
if
i
remember
things
correctly
the
models
involved
contributions
from
three
different
bb
sources
so
theres
no
obvious
temperature
of
background
radiation
in
our
local
area
however
the
following
references
give
the
interstellar
radiation
density
as
a
function
of
wavelength
and
you
can
integrate
and
average
in
an
appropriate
manner
to
get
an
effective

the

that
absolutely
no

it

as
i
can

closest

a

its

but
at

it
was
a

so
you
have
a

for

at

i
dont
have
any
plausible
models
for

at
any
distances
recent
observations
have
just
about
ruled
out
the
merging
neutron
star
hypothesis
which
had
a
lot
of
problems
anyhow
we
have
to
look
for
implausible
models
and
what
is
fundamentally
allowed
independent
of
models
hmm
the
superbowl
burst
has
been
claimed
in
press
releases
to
cast
doubt
on
the
merging
ns
hypothesis
from
what
ive
read
and
i
havent
seen
the

only
the
press
id
say
it
is
consistent
with
some
of
the

models
a

on
the

just

of

here
is
the
abstract
of
that
paper
indicator
to
these

all
possible
sources
which
are
isotropically
distributed
should
remain
under
consideration
this
is
why
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
is
kept
on
the
list
although
there
is
no
known
mechanism
for
generating
grbs
from
cometary
nuclei
unlikely
as
it
may
seem
the
possibility
that
grbs
originate
in
the
solar
cometary
cloud
cannot
be
excluded
until
it
is
disproved
this
does
not
propose
a
mechanism
for
grbs
in
the
oort
and
no
antimatter
annihilation
does
not
fit
the

at

as

alan
stern
of
the
southwest
research
institute
gave
a
talk
on
the
plutocharon
binary
system
yesterday
he
gave
a
brief
overview
of
the
currentlyaccepted
system
parameters
volume
ratio
of
about
mass
ratio
about
or
so
plus
lots
more
and
then
gave
his
thoughts
on
the
formation
of
plutocharon
his
idea
is
that
there
were
lots
and
lots
of
small
planetesimals
in
the
outer
solar
system
with
masses
distributed
as
a
power
law
of
some
kind
over
time
the
planetesimals
accreted
into
larger
bodies
most
got
scattered
out
of
the
solar
system
by
close
encounters
with
jupiter
and
saturn
but
many
accreted
into
the
gas
giants
especially
uranus
and
neptune
a
large
planetesimal
was
captured
by
neptune
we
call
it
triton
captured
how
perhaps
by
a
collision
with
a
smaller
alreadyexisting
neptunian
moon
perhaps
by
a
very
close
passage
through
neptunes
atmosphere
mondo
aerobraking
he
notes
that
the
two
recently
discovered
kuiper
belt
objects
and
fw
plus
chiron
and
pholus
are
all
about
the
same
mass
and
he
identifies
this
group
as
oneaccretiondown
from
the
larger
bodies
of
triton
and
plutocharon
plutocharon
he
thinks
formed
when
an
impacting
body
hit
protopluto
knocking
some
material
into
a
ring
around
pluto
which
later
accreted
in
charon
similar
to
ideas
about
the
formation
of
earths
moon
there
is
good
evidence
from
spectra
that
the
surfaces
of
pluto
and
charon
are
very
different
pluto
has
methane
frost
charon
doesnt
which
can
be
used
as
evidence
for
the
impact
theory
he
believes
that
there
may
be
around
plutotochironsized
objects
remaining
in
a
relatively
stable
dynamical
zone
just
outside
neptunes
orbit
beyond
au
or
so
and
fw
are
the
first
members
of
this
population
to
be
found
in
his
model
note
that
such
bodies
will
be
very
dark
since
if
their
surfaces
are
covered
with
methane
frost
it
will
have
photolyzed
into
very
dark
longchain
hydrocarbons
by
now
the
reason
that
pluto
has
such
a
high
albedo
around
i
think
is
that
its
surface
warms
up
just
enough
around
perihelion
to
sublimate
and
when
the
atmosphere
freezes
out
again
thirty
years
later
it
forms
bright
new
frost
so
any
bodies
much
farther
away
than
au
are
going
to
be
very
hard
to
see
i
hope
i
havent
made
any

that
the
current

are
to
use

to

the

just
about

to

we
were
speaking
loosely
at
the
time
hed
like
to
use
a
proton
which
gives
a
slightly
smaller
velocity
but
costs
much
less
his
figures
million
for
titan
launches
there
will
be
two
separate
probes
launched
separately
or
million
for
proton
launches
he
told

having
read
in
the
past
about
the
failsafe
mechanisms
on
spacecraft
i
had
assumed
that
the
command
loss
timer
had
that
sort
of
function
however
i
always
find
disturbing
the
oxymoron
of
a
noop
command
that
does
something
if
the
command
changes
the
behavior
or
status
of
the
spacecraft
it
is
not
a
noop
command
of
course
this
terminology
comes
from
a
jet
propulsion
laboratory
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
jet
propulsion
i
dont
know
where
you
got
this
idea
from
jpls
history
dates
back
to
to
the
when
a
caltech
professor
named
von
karman
conducted
experiments
in
rocket
propulsion
with
a
group
of
graduate
students
on
the
present
site
of
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
the
army
started
funding
the
laboratory
and
had
jurisdiction
untill
the
late
when
nasa
took
over
the
early
research
conducted
at
the
laboratory
led
to
many
applications
the
first
being
jetassisted
takeoff
rockets
for
aircraft
i
think
this
should
explain
where
jpl
got
its
name
i
should
know
i
worked
there
for
five
wonderful

you

best
of

you
can

us
in
our
own
way
can
contribute
to
a
comprehensive
document
which
can
be
released
to
the
general
public
around
the
world
the
document
would
scientifically
analyze
the
technical
aspects
of
long
term
human
habitation
in
space
why
is
the
general
public
going
to
be
interested
in
the
technical
details
of
long
term
space
habitation
i
like
the
idea
of
the
study
but
it
should
be
released
to
other
scientists
and
engineers
who
will
be
able
to
use
it
if
you
want
a
general
public
document
youll
need
a
more
general
publication
i
believe
that
if
any
longterm
space
exploration
program
is
to
succeed
we
need
to
basically
learn
how
to
engineer
our
own
microworld
ie
the
spacecraft
only
through
the
careful
analyses
of
engineering
chemical
biological
and
medical
factors
will
a
good
ecosystem
be
created
to
facilitate
human
life
on
a
longduration
flight
as
one
working
on
controlled
ecological
life
support
systems
engineering
the
microworld
isnt
the
problem
the
problem
is
understanding
the
basic
chemical
biological
and
medical
factors
to
be
able
to
engineer
them
efficiently
for
example
the
only
way
we
know
how
to
produce
food
is
from
plants
and
animals
food
synthesis
is
not
very
far
advanced
so
we
have
to
orbit
a
farm
well
thats
obviously
not
very
efficient
so
we
use
technology
to
reduce
the
mass
and
grow
plants
hydroponically
instead
of
using
dirt
this
is
where
the
engineering
comes
in
but
new
technologies
bring
new
basic
questions
that
we
dont
have
the
answers
to
like
in
dirt
we
can
grow
tomatoes
and
lettuce
right
beside
each
other
but
in
hydroponics
it
turns
out
that
you
cant
do
that
the
lettuce
growth
is
stunted
when
its
grown
in
the
same
hydroponic
solution
as
tomatoes
so
now
you
have
to
consider
what
other
plants
are
going
to
have
similar
interactions
this
means
some
basic
applied
scientific
research
and
thats
what
needs
to
be
done
with
all
technologies
that
have
been
developed
so
far
we
also
need
to
find
out
how
they
interact
together
thats
where
we
are
now
so
i
would
like
to
see
posts
of
opinions
regarding
the
most
objective
methods
to
analyze
the
accepted
scientific
literature
for
technologies
which
can
be
applied
to
longduration
spaceflight
first
you
need
to
do
the
literature
search
there
is
a
lot
of
information
out
there
maybe
we
should
just
pick
a
specific
area
of
long
term
habitation
this
could
be
useful
especially
if
we
make
it
available
on
the
net
then
we
can
look
at
methods
of
analyzing
the
technologies
such
a
detailed
literature
search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselves
as
space
advocates
and
clearly
important
to
existing
space
programs
in
essence
we
would
be
dividing
the
space
life
science
issues
into
various
technical
problems
which
could
be
solved
with
various
technologies
this
database
of
acceptable
solutions
to
various
problems
could
form
the
basis
of
detailed
discussions
involving
people
from
the
bionet
isunet
and
any
other
source
unless
there
is
an
unbelievable
outpouring
of
interest
on
this
on
the
net
i
think
we
should
develop
a
detailed
data
base
of
the
literature
search
first
then
if
we
accomplish
that
we
can
go
on
to
real
analysis
the
data
base
itself
could
be
useful
for
future
engineers

i
am
making

that

evolve
given
a

physical

the

what
physical

simply
disallow

jonathan
jonathan
interesting
questions
some
wonder
whether
or
not
the
moon
could
have
ever
supported
an
atmosphere
id
be
interested
in
knowing
what
our
geologyenvironmental
sciences
friends
think
as
for
human
tolerances
the
best
example
of
human
endurance
in
terms
of
altitude
ie
low
atmospheric
pressure
and
lower
oxygen
partial
pressure
is
in
my
opinion
to
the
scaling
of
mt
everest
without
oxygen
assistance
this
was
accomplished
by
a
team
of
mountaineers
who
trained
at
high
altitudes
for
quite
awhile
i
think
a
few
months
and
then
were
flown
by
helicopter
from
that
training
altitude
to
the
equivalent
altitude
on
mount
everest
where
they
began
the
ascent
of
our
planets
highest
peak
without
oxygen
tanks
this
is
quite
a
feat
of
physiological
endurance
because
if
you
or
i
tried
to
go
to
feet
and
exert
ourselves
we
would
probably
pass
out
get
altitude
sick
and
could
even
die
from
cerebral
edema
so
this
is
the
limit
of
low
pressure
high
pressure
situations
would
be
limited
by
the
duration
of
time
which
it
takes
to
slowly
acclimate
to
a
higher
pressure
skin
divers
would
know
alot
about
high
pressure
situations
and
could
tell
you
about
how
they
safely
make
deep
dives
without
getting
the
bends
some
military
experiments
have
put
people
under
several
atmospheres
of
pressure
not
sure
what
the
high
limit
was
because
the
papers
arent
in
front
of
me
usually
at
a
certain
point
the
nitrogen
in
the
air
becomes
toxic
to
the
body
and
you
start
acting
idiotic
divers
call
this
nitrogen
narcosis
those
afflicted
can
do
very
dangerous
and
irrational
things
like
taking
off
a
diving
mask
and
oxygen
tank
in
order
to
talk
to
fish
at
feet
under
water
hope
any
diving
folk
can
elaborate
on
this
matter
as
i
am
not
a
diving
expert
mars
cannot
support
human
life
without
pressurization
because
the
atmosphere
is
too
thin
th
our
earths
atmospheric
density
in
addition
the
mars
atmosphere
is
mostly
carbon
dioxide
basically
you
would
need
a
pressure
suit
there
or
youd
die
from
the
low
pressure

is

considerably
in

it

most

probably
are

even
by

they
would
have

removed
by

the
only
advantage
that
this
might
yield
is
that
we
could
put

i
also

that
as

the

a
big
issue

that
the

if

introduction
from
our
small
world
we
have
gazed
upon
the
cosmic
ocean
for
untold
thousands
of
years
ancient
astronomers
observed
points
of
light
that
appeared
to
move
among
the
stars
they
called
these
objects
planets
meaning
wanderers
and
named
them
after
roman
deities
jupiter
king
of
the
gods
mars
the
god
of
war
mercury
messenger
of
the
gods
venus
the
god
of
love
and
beauty
and
saturn
father
of
jupiter
and
god
of
agriculture
the
stargazers
also
observed
comets
with
sparkling
tails
and
meteors
or
shooting
stars
apparently
falling
from
the
sky
science
flourished
during
the
european
renaissance
fundamental
physical
laws
governing
planetary
motion
were
discovered
and
the
orbits
of
the
planets
around
the
sun
were
calculated
in
the
century
astronomers
pointed
a
new
device
called
the
telescope
at
the
heavens
and
made
startling
discoveries
but
the
years
since
have
amounted
to
a
golden
age
of
solar
system
exploration
advancements
in
rocketry
after
world
war
ii
enabled
our
machines
to
break
the
grip
of
earths
gravity
and
travel
to
the
moon
and
to
other
planets
the
united
states
has
sent
automated
spacecraft
then
humancrewed
expeditions
to
explore
the
moon
our
automated
machines
have
orbited
and
landed
on
venus
and
mars
explored
the
suns
environment
observed
comets
and
made
closerange
surveys
while
flying
past
mercury
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
these
travelers
brought
a
quantum
leap
in
our
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
solar
system
through
the
electronic
sight
and
other
senses
of
our
automated
spacecraft
color
and
complexion
have
been
given
to
worlds
that
for
centuries
appeared
to
earthbound
eyes
as
fuzzy
disks
or
indistinct
points
of
light
and
dozens
of
previously
unknown
objects
have
been
discovered
future
historians
will
likely
view
these
pioneering
flights
through
the
solar
system
as
some
of
the
most
remarkable
achievements
of
the
century
automated
spacecraft
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administrations
nasas
automated
spacecraft
for
solar
system
exploration
come
in
many
shapes
and
sizes
while
they
are
designed
to
fulfill
separate
and
specific
mission
objectives
the
craft
share
much
in
common
each
spacecraft
consists
of
various
scientific
instruments
selected
for
a
particular
mission
supported
by
basic

for
electrical
power
trajectory

these

known
as
the

for
the
early
planetary

nasa
employed
a
highly

called
the

their

helped
shape
the
planning
of
later
missions
between
and
seven
mariner
missions
conducted
the
first
surveys
of
our
planetary
neighbors
in

all
of
the
mariners
used
solar
panels
as
their
primary
power
source
the
first
and
the
final
versions
of
the

had
two
wings
covered
with

other

were
equipped
with
four

their

in
all
two

and
two
voyagers
were
sent
in
the
to
tour
the

because
of
the
distances
involved
these

took
anywhere
from
months
to
years
to
reach
their
destinations
barring
faster
spacecraft
they
will
eventually
become
the
first
human
artifacts
to
journey
to
distant

because
the

light
becomes
so
faint
in
the

these

do
not
use

instead
operate

one

the

also
produces
a
strong

and
streams
of
charged

both
extending
far
beyond

the

appears
to
have
been
active
for
billion

and
has
enough
fuel
to
go
on
for
another
five
billion

or
so
at
the
end
of
its
life
the
sun
will
start
to
fuse
helium
into
heavier

and
begin
to
swell
up
ultimately
growing
so
large
that
it
will
swallow

after
a
billion

it
will
suddenly
collapse
into

many

obtaining

was
the
primary

of
the

spacecraft
launched
on
november
from

center
in
florida
after
a
journey
of
nearly
five
months
which
included
a

the

passed
within
kilometers

of
the
solar

innermost
planet
on
march
until
mariner
little
was
known
about
mercury
even
the
best
telescopic
views
from
earth
showed
mercury
as
an
indistinct
object
lacking
any
surface
detail
the
planet
is
so
close
to
the
sun
that
it
is
usually
lost
in
solar
glare
when
the
planet
is
visible
on
earths
horizon
just
after
sunset
or
before
dawn
it
is
obscured
by
the
haze
and
dust
in
our

only
radar
telescopes
gave
any
hint
of
mercurys
surface
conditions
prior
to
the
voyage
of

the
photographs
mariner
radioed
back
to

revealed
an
ancient
heavily
cratered
surface
closely
resembling
our
own

the
pictures
also
showed
huge

crisscrossing
the

these
apparently
were
created
when

the

are
as
high
as

discovered
that

has
a
weak

a
trillionth
the

of

and
composed
chiefly
of
argon

range
from

this

is
the
largest
for

mercury
literally
bakes

freezes
at
the

time
days
and

are
long
on

the
combination
of
a
slow
rotation
relative
to
the
stars
earth
days
and
a
rapid
revolution
around
the
sun
earth
days
means
that
one
mercury

takes
earth
days
or
two
mercury
years
the
time
it
takes
the
innermost
planet
to
complete
two
orbits
around
the

mercury
appears
to
have
a
crust
of
light
silicate
rock
like
that
of
earth
scientists
believe
mercury
has
a
heavy
ironrich
core
making
up
slightly
less
than
half
of
its
volume
that
would
make
mercurys
core
larger
proportionally
than
the

core
or
those
of
any
of
the

mariner
made
two
additional

on
september
and
march
before

exhausted
and
the

was
concluded
each

took
place
at
the

time
when
the

we
still

venus
our

back
to

during
their
descent
toward
the

although
designed
to
examine
the

one
of
the
probes
survived
its
impact
with
the
surface
and
continued
to
transmit
data
for
another
hour
venus
resembles
earth
in
size
physical
composition
and
density
more
closely
than
any
other
known
planet
however
spacecraft
have
discovered
significant
differences
as
well
for
example
venus
rotation
west
to
east
is
retrograde
backward
compared
to
the
easttowest
spin
of
earth
and
most
of
the
other
planets
approximately
percent
of
venus
atmosphere
times
as
dense
as
earths
is
carbon
dioxide
the
principal
constituent
of
earths
atmosphere
is
nitrogen
venus
atmosphere
acts
like
a
greenhouse
permitting
solar
radiation
to
reach
the
surface
but
trapping
the
heat
that
would
ordinarily
be
radiated
back
into

as
a
result
the

is
degrees
celsius
degrees

craters
survive
on

for
perhaps
million
years
because
there
is
no

and
very
little
wind
erosion
extensive
faultline
networks
cover
the
planet
probably
the
result
of
the
same
crustal
flexing
that
produces
plate
tectonics
on
earth
but
on
venus
the
surface
temperature
is
sufficient
to
weaken
the
rock
which
cracks
just
about
everywhere
preventing
the
formation
of
major
plates
and
large

faults
like
the

in

from

we
have
learned
much
about
our

the

canaveral
in
florida
on
january
and
discovered
an
intense
radiation
zone
now
called
the
van
allen
radiation
belts
surrounding

since
then
other
research
satellites
have
revealed
that
our

magnetic
field
is
distorted
into
a
teardrop
shape
by
the
solar
wind
the
stream
of
charged
particles
continuously
ejected
from
the
sun
weve
learned
that
the
magnetic
field
does
not
fade
off
into
space
but
has
definite
boundaries
and
we
now
know
that
our
wispy
upper
atmosphere
once
believed
calm
and
uneventful
seethes
with
activity
swelling
by
day
and
contracting
by

affected
by
changes
in

the
upper

contributes
to

and
climate
on

besides
affecting
earths

solar
activity
gives
rise
to
a
dramatic
visual
phenomenon
in
our

when
charged

from

become
trapped
in

they
collide
with

these

play
a
major
role
in

these
watchful

continuous
global

provides
a
vast

six

landed

explored
the

between

carrying
back
a
collection
of

and

weighing
a
total
of
kilograms
pounds
and
consisting
of
more
than
separate
samples
from
this
material
and
other
studies
scientists
have
constructed
a
history
of
the
moon
that
includes
its
infancy
rocks
collected
from
the
lunar
highlands
date
to
about
billion
years
old
the
first
few
million
years
of
the
moons
existence
were
so
violent
that
few
traces
of
this
period
remain
as
a
molten
outer
layer
gradually
cooled
and
solidified
into
different
kinds
of
rock
the
moon
was
bombarded
by
huge
asteroids
and
smaller
objects
some
of
the
asteroids
were
as
large
as
rhode
island
or
delaware
and
their
collisions
with
the
moon
created
basins
hundreds
of
kilometers
across
this
catastrophic
bombardment
tapered
off
approximately
four
billion
years
ago
leaving
the
lunar
highlands
covered
with
huge
overlapping
craters
and
a
deep
layer
of
shattered
and
broken
rock
heat
produced
by
the
decay
of
radioactive
elements
began
to
melt
the
interior
of
the
moon
at
depths
of
about
kilometers
miles
below
the
surface
then
for
the
next
million
years
from
about
to
billion
years
ago
lava
rose
from
inside
the
moon
the
lava
gradually
spread
out
over
the
surface
flooding
the
large
impact
basins
to
form
the
dark
areas
that
galileo
galilei
an
astronomer
of
the
italian
renaissance
called
maria
meaning
seas
as
far
as
we
can
tell
there
has
been
no
significant
volcanic
activity
on
the
moon
for
more
than
three
billion
years
since
then
the
lunar
surface
has
been
altered
only
by
micrometeorites
by
the
atomic
particles
from
the
sun
and
stars
by
the
rare
impacts
of
large
meteorites
and
by
spacecraft
and
astronauts
if
our
astronauts
had
landed
on
the
moon
a
billion
years
ago
they
would
have
seen
a
landscape
very
similar
to
the
one
today
thousands
of
years
from
now
the
footsteps
left
by
the
apollo
crews
will
remain
sharp
and
clear
the
origin
of
the
moon
is
still
a
mystery
four
theories
attempt
an
explanation
the
moon
formed
near
earth
as
a
separate
body
it
was
torn
from
earth
it
formed
somewhere
else
and
was
captured
by
our
planets
gravity
or
it
was
the
result
of
a
collision
between
earth
and
an
asteroid
about
the
size
of
mars
the
last
theory
has
some
good
support
but
is
far
from
certain
mars
of
all
the
planets
mars
has
long
been
considered
the
solar
systems
prime
candidate
for
harboring
extraterrestrial
life
astronomers
studying
the
red
planet
through
telescopes
saw
what
appeared
to
be
straight
lines
crisscrossing
its
surface
these
observations
later
determined
to
be
optical
illusions
led
to
the
popular
notion
that
intelligent
beings
had
constructed
a
system
of
irrigation
canals
on
the
planet
in
when
orson
welles
broadcast
a
radio
drama
based
on
the
science
fiction
classic
war
of
the
worlds
by
hg
wells
enough
people
believed
in
the
tale
of
invading
martians
to
cause
a
near
panic
another
reason
for
scientists
to
expect
life
on
mars
had
to
do
with
the
apparent
seasonal
color
changes
on
the
planets
surface
this
phenomenon
led
to
speculation
that
conditions
might
support
a
bloom
of
martian
vegetation
during
the
warmer
months
and
cause
plant
life
to
become
dormant
during
colder
periods
so
far
six
american
missions
to
mars
have
been
carried
out
four
mariner
spacecraft
three
flying
by
the
planet
and
one
placed
into
martian
orbit
surveyed
the

extensively
before
the

and
followed
with
their

and
showed
a
diversity
of

conditions
as
well
as
a
thin
cold

of
carbon

on
may
the
mariner
orbiter
was
launched
on
a
mission
to
make
a
yearlong
study
of
the
martian
surface
the
spacecraft
arrived
five
and
a
half
months
after
liftoff
only
to
find
mars
in
the
midst
of
a
planetwide
dust
storm
that
made
surface
photography
impossible
for
several
weeks
but
after
the
storm
cleared
mariner
began
returning
the
first
of
pictures
these
revealed
previously
unknown
martian
features
including
evidence
that
large
amounts
of
water
once
flowed
across
the
surface
etching
river
valleys
and
flood
plains
in
august
and
september
the
viking
and
spacecraft
each
consisting
of
an
orbiter
and
a
lander
lifted
off
from
kennedy
space
center
the
mission
was
designed
to
answer
several
questions
about
the
red
planet
including
is
there
life
there
nobody
expected
the
spacecraft
to
spot
martian
cities
but
it
was
hoped
that
the
biology
experiments
on
the
viking
landers
would
at
least
find
evidence
of
primitive
life
past
or
present
viking
lander
became
the
first
spacecraft
to
successfully
touch
down
on
another
planet
when
it
landed
on
july
while
the
united
states
was
celebrating
its
bicentennial
photos
sent
back
from
the
chryse
planitia
plains
of
gold
showed
a
bleak
rustyred
landscape
panoramic
images
returned
by
the
lander
revealed
a
rolling
plain
littered
with
rocks
and
marked
by
rippled
sand
dunes
fine
red
dust
from
the
martian
soil
gives
the
sky
a
salmon
hue
when
viking
lander
touched
down
on
utopia
planitia
on
september
it
viewed
a
more
rolling
landscape
than
the
one
seen
by
its
predecessor
one
without
visible
dunes
the
results
sent
back
by
the
laboratory
on
each
viking
lander
were
inconclusive
small
samples
of
the
red
martian
soil
were
tested
in
three
different
experiments
designed
to
detect
biological
processes
while
some
of
the
test
results
seemed
to
indicate
biological
activity
later
analysis
confirmed
that
this
activity
was
inorganic
in
nature
and
related
to
the
planets
soil
chemistry
is
there
life
on
mars
no
one
knows
for
sure
but
the
viking
mission
found
no
evidence
that
organic
molecules
exist
there
the
viking
landers
became
weather
stations
recording
wind
velocity
and
direction
as
well
as
atmospheric
temperature
and
pressure
few
weather
changes
were
observed
the
highest
temperature
recorded
by
either
craft
was
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
at
the
viking
lander
site
in
midsummer
the
lowest
temperature
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
was
recorded
at
the
more
northerly
viking
lander
site
during
winter
nearhurricane
wind
speeds
were
measured
at
the
two
martian
weather
stations
during
global
dust
storms
but
because
the
atmosphere
is
so
thin
wind
force
is
minimal
viking
lander
photographed
light
patches
of
frost
probably
waterice
during
its
second
winter
on
the
planet
the
martian
atmosphere
like
that
of
venus
is
primarily
carbon
dioxide
nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
present
only
in
small
percentages
martian
air
contains
only
about
as
much
water
as
our
air
but
even
this
small
amount
can
condense
out
forming
clouds
that
ride
high
in
the
atmosphere
or
swirl
around
the
slopes
of
towering
volcanoes
local
patches
of
early
morning
fog
can
form
in
valleys
there
is
evidence
that
in
the
past
a
denser
martian
atmosphere
may
have
allowed
water
to
flow
on
the
planet
physical
features
closely
resembling
shorelines
gorges
riverbeds
and
islands
suggest
that
great
rivers
once
marked
the
planet
mars
has
two
moons
phobos
and
deimos
they
are
small
and
irregularly
shaped
and
possess
ancient
cratered
surfaces
it
is
possible
the
moons
were
originally
asteroids
that
ventured
too
close
to
mars
and
were
captured
by
its
gravity
the
viking
orbiters
and
landers
exceeded
by
large
margins
their
design
lifetimes
of
and
days
respectively
the
first
to
fail
was
viking
orbiter
which
stopped
operating
on
july
when
a
leak
depleted
its
attitudecontrol
gas
viking
lander
operated
until
april
when
it
was
shut
down
because
of
battery
degeneration
viking
orbiter
quit
on
august
when
the
last
of
its
attitudecontrol
gas
was
used
up
viking
lander
ceased
functioning
on
november
despite
the
inconclusive
results
of
the
viking
biology
experiments
we
know
more
about
mars
than
any
other
planet
except
earth
nasas
mars
observer
spacecraft
to
be
launched
in
september
will
expand
our
knowledge
of
the
martian
environment
and
lead
to
human
exploration
of
the
red
planet
asteroids
the
solar
system
has
a
large
number
of
rocky
and
metallic
objects
that
are
in
orbit
around
the
sun
but
are
too
small
to
be
considered
fullfledged
planets
these
objects
are
known
as
asteroids
or
minor
planets
most
but
not
all
are
found
in
a
band
or
belt
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
some
have
orbits
that
cross
earths
path
and
there
is
evidence
that
earth
has
been
hit
by
asteroids
in
the
past
one
of
the
least
eroded
best
preserved
examples
is
the
barringer
meteor
crater
near
winslow
arizona
asteroids
are
material
left
over
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
one
theory
suggests
that
they
are
the
remains
of
a
planet
that
was
destroyed
in
a
massive
collision
long
ago
more
likely
asteroids
are
material
that
never
coalesced
into
a
planet
in
fact
if
the
estimated
total
mass
of
all
asteroids
was
gathered
into
a
single
object
the
object
would
be
only
about
kilometers
miles
across
less
than
half
the
diameter
of
our
moon
thousands
of
asteroids
have
been
identified
from
earth
it
is
estimated
that
are
bright
enough
to
eventually
be
photographed
through
earthbased
telescopes
much
of
our
understanding
about
asteroids
comes
from
examining
pieces
of
space
debris
that
fall
to
the
surface
of
earth
asteroids
that
are
on
a
collision
course
with
earth
are
called
meteoroids
when
a
meteoroid
strikes
our
atmosphere
at
high
velocity
friction
causes
this
chunk
of
space
matter
to
incinerate
in
a
streak
of
light
known
as
a
meteor
if
the
meteoroid
does
not
burn
up
completely
whats
left
strikes
earths
surface
and
is
called
a
meteorite
one
of
the
best
places
to
look
for
meteorites
is
the
ice
cap
of
antarctica
of
all
the
meteorites
examined
percent
are
composed
of
silicate
stone
and
percent
are
composed
of
iron
and
nickel
the
rest
are
a
mixture
of
the
three
materials
stony
meteorites
are
the
hardest
to
identify
since
they
look
very
much
like
terrestrial
rocks
since
asteroids
are
material
from
the
very
early
solar
system
scientists
are
interested
in
their
composition
spacecraft
that
have
flown
through
the
asteroid
belt
have
found
that
the
belt
is
really
quite
empty
and
that
asteroids
are
separated
by
very
large
distances
current
and
future
missions
will
fly
by
selected
asteroids

sulfur

it
is
likely
that
methane
ammonia

react
to
form
organic
molecules
in
the
regions
between
the

frigid
cloud
tops
and
the
warmer
hydrogen
ocean
lying
below
because
of
jupiters
atmospheric

however
these
organic
compounds
if
they
exist
are
probably
shortlived
the
great

has
been
observed
for
centuries
through

this

storm
in
jupiters

is
more
than

the

it
is
surrounded
by
swirling
currents
that
rotate
around
the

and
are
sometimes
consumed
by

the
great
red

might
be
a
million

our

the

the

will
spend
two
years
circling

and
flying
close

exploring
in
detail
what
the
two

and
two

revealed
galilean

in
galileo
galilei
aimed
his
telescope
at

and
spotted
four
points
of
light
orbiting
the
planet
for
the
first
time
humans
had
seen
the
moons
of
another
world
in
honor
of
their
discoverer
these
four
bodies
would
become
known
as
the
galilean
satellites
or
moons
but
galileo
might
have
happily
traded
this
honor
for
one
look
at
the
dazzling
photographs
returned
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
as
they
flew
past
these
planetsized
satellites
one
of
the
most
remarkable
findings
of
the
voyager
mission
was
the
presence
of
active
volcanoes
on
the
galilean
moon
io
volcanic
eruptions
had
never
before
been
observed
on
a
world
other
than
earth
the
voyager
cameras
identified
at
least
nine
active
volcanoes
on
io
with
plumes
of
ejected
material
extending
as
far
as
kilometers
miles
above
the
moons
surface
ios
pizzacolored
terrain
marked
by
orange
and
yellow
hues
is
probably
the
result
of
sulfurrich
materials
brought
to
the
surface
by
volcanic
activity
volcanic
activity
on
this
satellite
is
the
result
of
tidal
flexing
caused
by
the
gravitational
tugofwar
between
io
jupiter
and
the
other
three
galilean
moons
europa
approximately
the
same
size
as
our
moon
is
the
brightest
galilean
satellite
the
moons
surface
displays
a
complex
array
of
streaks
indicating
the
crust
has
been
fractured
caught
in
a
gravitational
tugofwar
like
io
europa
has
been
heated
enough
to
cause
its
interior
ice
to
melt
apparently
producing
a
liquidwater
ocean
this
ocean
is
covered
by
an
ice
crust
that
has
formed
where
water
is
exposed
to
the
cold
of
space
europas
core
is
made
of
rock
that
sank
to
its
center
like
europa
the
other
two
galilean
moons
ganymede
and
callisto
are
worlds
of
ice
and
rock
ganymede
is
the
largest
satellite
in
the
solar
system
larger
than
the
planets
mercury
and
pluto
the
satellite
is
composed
of
about
percent
water
or
ice
and
the
rest
rock
ganymedes
surface
has
areas
of
different
brightness
indicating
that
in
the
past
material
oozed
out
of
the
moons
interior
and
was
deposited
at
various
locations
on
the
surface
callisto
only
slightly
smaller
than
ganymede
has
the
lowest
density
of
any
galilean
satellite
suggesting
that
large
amounts
of
water
are
part

saturn
no
planet
in
the
solar

is
adorned
like
saturn
its
exquisite
ring
system
is
unrivaled
like
jupiter
saturn
is
composed
mostly
of
hydrogen
but
in
contrast
to
the
vivid
colors
and
wild
turbulence
found
in
jovian
clouds
saturns
atmosphere
has
a
more
subtle
butterscotch
hue
and
its
markings
are
muted
by
highaltitude
haze
given
saturns
somewhat
placidlooking
appearance
scientists
were
surprised
at
the
highvelocity

three
american
spacecraft
have
visited
saturn
pioneer
sped
by
the
planet
and
its
moon
titan
in
september
returning
the
first
closeup
images
voyager
followed
in
november
sending
back
breathtaking
photographs
that
revealed
for
the
first
time
the
complexities
of
saturns
ring
system
and
moons
voyager
flew
by
the
planet
and
its
moons
in
august
the
rings
are
composed
of
countless
lowdensity
particles
orbiting
individually
around
saturns
equator
at
progressive
distances
from
the
cloud
tops
analysis
of
spacecraft
radio
waves
passing
through
the
rings
showed
that
the
particles
vary
widely
in
size
ranging
from
dust
to
housesized
boulders
the
rings
are
bright
because
they
are
mostly
ice
and
frosted
rock
the
rings
might
have
resulted
when
a
moon
or
a
passing
body
ventured
too
close
to
saturn
the
unlucky
object
would
have
been
torn
apart
by
great
tidal
forces
on
its
surface
and
in
its
interior
or
the
object
may
not
have
been
fully
formed
to
begin
with
and
disintegrated
under
the
influence
of
saturns
gravity
a
third
possibility
is
that
the
object
was
shattered
by
collisions
with
larger
objects
orbiting
the
planet
unable
either
to
form
into
a
moon
or
to
drift
away
from
each
other
individual
ring
particles
appear
to
be
held
in
place
by
the
gravitational
pull
of
saturn
and
its
satellites
these
complex
gravitational
interactions
form
the
thousands
of
ringlets
that
make
up
the
major
rings
radio
emissions
quite
similar
to
the
static
heard
on
an
am
car
radio
during
an
electrical
storm
were
detected
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
these
emissions
are
typical
of
lightning
but
are
believed
to
be
coming
from
saturns
ring
system
rather
than
its
atmosphere
where
no
lightning
was
observed
as
they
had
at
jupiter
the
voyagers
saw
a
version
of
earths
auroras
near
saturns
poles
the
voyagers
discovered
new
moons
and
found
several
satellites
that
share
the
same
orbit
we
learned
that
some
moons
shepherd
ring
particles
maintaining
saturns
rings
and
the
gaps
in
the
rings
saturns
moon
was
discovered
in
from
images
taken
by
voyager
in
voyager
determined
that
titan
has
a
nitrogenbased
atmosphere
with
methane
and
argon
one
more
like
earths
in
composition
than
the
carbon
dioxide
atmospheres
of
mars
and
venus
titans
surface
temperature
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
implies
that
there
might
be
waterice
islands
rising
above
oceans
of
ethanemethane
liquid
or
sludge
unfortunately
voyagers
cameras
could
not
penetrate
the
moons
dense
clouds
continuing
photochemistry
from
solar
radiation
may
be
converting
titans
methane
to
ethane
acetylene
and
in
combination
with
nitrogen
hydrogen
cyanide
the
latter
compound
is
a
building
block
of
amino
acids
these
conditions
may
be
similar
to
the
atmospheric
conditions
of
primeval
earth
between
three
and
four
billion
years
ago
however
titans
atmospheric
temperature
is
believed
to
be
too
low
to
permit
progress
beyond
this
stage
of
organic
chemistry
the
exploration
of
saturn
will
continue
with
the
cassini
mission
the
cassini
spacecraft
will
orbit
the
planet
and
will
also
deploy
a
probe
called
huygens
which
will
be
dropped
into
titans
atmosphere
and
fall
to
the
surface
cassini
will
use
the
probe
as
well
as
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
will
spend
years
examining
the
saturnian
system
uranus
in
january
four
and
a
half
years
after
visiting
saturn
voyager
completed
the
first
closeup
survey
of
the
uranian
system
the
brief
flyby
revealed
more
information
about
uranus
and
its
retinue
of
icy
moons
than
had
been
gleaned
from
ground
observations
since
the
planets
discovery
over
two
centuries
ago
by
the
english
astronomer
william
herschel
uranus
third
largest
of
the
planets
is
an
oddball
of
the
solar
system
unlike
the
other
planets
with
the
exception
of
pluto
this
giant
lies
tipped
on
its
side
with
its
north
and
south
poles
alternately
facing
the
sun
during
an
swing
around
the
solar
system
during
voyager
flyby
the
south
pole
faced
the
sun
uranus
might
have
been
knocked
over
when
an
earthsized
object
collided
with
it
early
in
the
life
of
the
solar
system
voyager
found
that
uranus
magnetic
field
does
not
follow
the
usual
northsouth
axis
found
on
the
other
planets
instead
the
field
is
tilted
degrees
and
offset
from
the
planets
center
a
phenomenon
that
on
earth
would
be
like
having
one
magnetic
pole
in
new
york
city
and
the
other
in
the
city
of
djakarta
on
the
island
of

uranus
atmosphere
consists
mainly
of
hydrogen
with
some
percent
helium
and
small
amounts
of
ammonia
methane
and

the

voyager
discovered

the

known
miranda
ariel
umbriel
titania
and

range
in

from
to
kilometers

across
representing
a

these

moons
are
halfice
halfrock
spheres
that
are
cold
and
dark
and
show
evidence
of
past
activity
including
faulting
and
ice

the
most
remarkable
of
uranus
moons
is
miranda
its
surface
features
high
cliffs
as
well
as
canyons
craterpocked
plains
and
winding
valleys
the
sharp
variations
in
terrain
suggest
that
after
the
moon
formed
it
was
smashed
apart
by
a
collision
with
another
body
an
event
not
unusual
in
our
solar
system
which
contains
many
objects
that
have
impact
craters
or
are
fragments
from
large
impacts
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
miranda
apparently
reformed
with
some
of
the
material
that
had
been
in
its
interior
exposed
on
its
surface
uranus
was
thought
to
have
nine
dark
rings
voyager
imaged
in
contrast
to
saturns
rings
which
are
composed
of
bright
particles
uranus
rings
are
primarily
made
up
of
dark
bouldersized
chunks
neptune
voyager
completed
its
tour
of
the
solar
system
with
an
investigation
of
neptune
and
the
planets
moons
on
august
the
spacecraft
swept
to
within
kilometers
miles
of
neptune
and
then
flew
on
to
the
moon
triton
during
the
neptune
encounter
it
became
clear
that
the
planets
atmosphere
was
more
active
than
uranus
voyager
observed
the
great
dark
spot
a
circular
storm
the
size
of
earth
in
neptunes
atmosphere
resembling
jupiters
great
red
spot
the
storm
spins
counterclockwise
and
moves
westward
at
almost
kilometers
miles
per

voyager
also
noted
a
smaller
dark
spot
and
a
fastmoving
cloud
dubbed
the

as
well
as

over
the
main

the
highest

neptune
has
a

the

contains
a
higher
percentage
of

than
those
of
the
other

giants
neptunes
distinctive
blue
appearance

neptunes
magnetic
field
is
tilted
relative
to
the
planets
spin
axis
and
is
not
centered
at
the
core
this
phenomenon
is
similar
to
uranus
magnetic
field
and
suggests
that
the
fields
of
the
two
giants
are
being
generated
in
an
area
above
the
cores
where
the
pressure
is
so
great
that
liquid
hydrogen
assumes
the
electrical
properties
of
a
metal
earths
magnetic

on
the

hand
is
produced
by
its
spinning

core
and
is
only
slightly
tilted
and
offset
relative
to
its
center
voyager
also
shed
light
on
the
mystery
of
neptunes
rings
observations
from
earth
indicated
that
there
were
arcs
of
material
in
orbit
around
the
giant
planet
it
was
not
clear
how
neptune
could
have
arcs
and
how
these
could
be
kept
from
spreading
out
into
even
unclumped
rings
voyager
detected
these
arcs
but
they
were
in
fact
part
of
thin
complete
rings
a
number
of
small
moons
could
explain
the
arcs
but
such
bodies
were
not
spotted
astronomers
had
identified
the
neptunian
moons
triton
in
and
nereid
in
voyager
found
six
more
one
of
the
new
moons
proteus
is
actually
larger
than
nereid
but
since
proteus
orbits
close
to
neptune
it
was
lost
in
the

glare
for
observers
on
earth
triton
circles
neptune
in
a

in

tidal
forces
on
triton
are
causing
it
to
spiral
slowly
towards
the
planet
in
to
million
years
a
short
time
in
astronomical
terms
the
moon
will
be
so
close
that
neptunian
gravity
will
tear
it
apart
forming
a
spectacular
ring
to
accompany
the

modest
current

tritons
landscape
is
as
strange
and
unexpected
as
those
of

and
miranda
the
moon
has
more
rock
than
its
counterparts
at
saturn
and
uranus
tritons
mantle
is
probably
composed
of
waterice
but
the
moons
crust
is
a
thin
veneer
of
nitrogen
and
methane
the
moon
shows
two
dramatically
different
types
of
terrain
the
socalled
cantaloupe
terrain
and
a
receding
ice
cap
dark
streaks
appear
on
the
ice
cap
these
streaks
are
the
fallout
from
geyserlike
volcanic
vents
that
shoot
nitrogen
gas
and
dark
finegrained
particles
to
heights
of
to
kilometers
to
miles
tritons
thin
atmosphere
only
as
thick
as

has
winds
that
carry
the
dark

them
as

triton
might
be
more

pluto
than
any
other
object
spacecraft
have
so
far
visited
pluto
pluto
is
the
most
distant
of
the
planets
yet
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
periodically
carries
it
inside
neptunes
orbit
where
it
has
been
since
and
where
it
will
remain
until
march
plutos
orbit
is
also
highly
inclined
tilted
degrees
to
the
orbital
plane
of
the
other
planets
discovered
in
pluto
appears
to
be
little
more
than
a
celestial
snowball
the
planets
diameter
is
calculated
to
be
approximately
kilometers
miles
only
twothirds
the
size
of
our
moon
groundbased
observations
indicate
that
plutos
surface
is
covered
with
methane
ice
and
that
there
is
a
thin
atmosphere
that
may
freeze
and
fall
to
the
surface
as
the
planet
moves
away
from
the
sun
observations
also
show
that
plutos
spin
axis
is
tipped
by
degrees
the
planet
has
one
known
satellite
charon
discovered
in
charons
surface
composition
is
different
from
plutos
the
moon
appears
to
be
covered
with
waterice
rather
than
methane
ice
its
orbit
is
gravitationally
locked
with
pluto
so
both
bodies
always
keep
the
same
hemisphere
facing
each
other
plutos
and
charons
rotational

currently
exploring
the
possibility
of
such
a
mission
comets
the
outermost
members
of
the
solar
system
occasionally
pay
a
visit
to
the
inner
planets
as
asteroids
are
the
rocky
and
metallic
remnants
of
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
comets
are
the
icy
debris
from
that
dim
beginning
and
can
survive
only
far
from
the
sun
most
comet
nuclei
reside
in
the
oort
cloud
a
loose
swarm
of
objects
in
a
halo
beyond
the
planets
and
reaching
perhaps
halfway
to
the
nearest
star
comet
nuclei
orbit
in
this
frozen
abyss
until
they
are
gravitationally
perturbed
into
new
orbits
that
carry
them
close
to
the
sun
as
a
nucleus
falls
inside
the
orbits
of
the
outer
planets
the
volatile
elements
of
which
it
is
made
gradually
warm
by
the
time
the
nucleus
enters
the
region
of
the
inner
planets
these
volatile
elements
are
boiling
the
nucleus
itself
is
irregular
and
only
a
few
miles
across
and
is
made
principally
of
waterice
with
methane
and
ammonia
materials
very
similar
to
those
composing
the
moons
of
the
giant
planets
as
these
materials
boil
off
of
the
nucleus
they
form
a
coma
or
cloudlike
head
that
can
measure
tens
of
thousands
of
kilometers
across
the
coma
grows
as
the
comet
gets
closer
to
the
sun
the
stream
of
charged
particles
coming
from
the
sun
pushes
on
this
cloud
blowing
it
back
like
a
flag
in
the
wind
and
giving
rise
to
the
comets
tails
gases
and
ions
are
blown
directly
back
from
the
nucleus
but
dust
particles
are
pushed
more
slowly
as
the

continues
in
its
orbit
the
dust
particles
are
left
behind
in
a
curved
arc
both
the
gas
and
dust
tails
point
away
from
the
sun
in
effect
the
comet
chases
its
tails
as
it
recedes
from
the
sun
the
tails
can
reach
million
kilometers
million
miles
in
length
but
the
total
amount
of

contained
in
this
dramatic
display
would
fit
in
an
ordinary

dramatic
light

some
comets
pass
through

only
once
but
others
have
their

gravitationally
modified
by
a
close

with
one
of
the

this
regular

because
he
plotted
the
comets
orbit
and
predicted
its

based
on
earlier
sightings
and
newtonian

his
name
became
part
of
astronomical
lore
when

unfortunately
sir
edmond
did
not
live
to
see
it
a

can
be
very
prominent
in

if
it

close
to

unfortunately
on
its
most
recent

halleys
comet
passed
no
closer
than

the
comet
was
visible
to
the
naked
eye
especially
for
viewers
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
it
was
not
spectacular
comets
have
been
so
bright
on
rare
occasions
that
they
were
visible
during
daytime
historically
comet
sightings
have
been
interpreted
as
bad
omens
and
have
been
artistically
rendered
as
daggers

has
lifted
the

we
have
learned
more
about
our

than
anyone
had
in

re
gamma
ray
bursters
where
are
they
i
feel
compelled
to
complain
the
statement
that
recent
observations
rule
out
merging
neutron
stars
as
sources
of
gammaray
bursts
is
utterly
false
even
though
it
is
popular
enough
to
make
it
to
batse
press
releases
the
idea
behind
the
statement
is
as
follows
if
you
smack
two
neutron
stars
together
or
have
a
neutron
star
be
gobbled
up
by
a
black
hole
a
lot
of
energy
is
released
enough
for
a
gammaray
burst
at
a
cosmological
distance
but
so
the
reasoning
continues
this
energy
is
released
below
a
lot
of
matter
so
the
radiation
becomes
thermalized
and
you
expect
to
see
roughly
a
blackbody
spectrum
the
observed
spectra
are
strongly
nonthermal
so
this
model
must
be
wrong
as
so
often
the
fault
lies
with
the
imagination
of
the
person
who
was
trying
to
prove
the
model
wrong
rather
than
with
the
model
it
may
be
that
the
initial
energy
release
is
not
seen
as
a
gammaray
burst
but
the
fireball
of
energy
and
matter
that
is
created
may
spew
out
a
relativistic
flow
when
this
slams
into
the
surrounding
medium
a
strong
flux
of
nonthermal
gamma
rays
results
which
may
carry
off
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
initial
total
energy
all
this
is
not
my
idea
it
is
in
a
series
of
papers
by
martin
rees
peter
meszaros
sorry
for
the
missing
accents
and
coworkers
it
is
certainly
not
a
complete
model
but
it
may
well
be
the
best
one
around
summing
over
all
proposed
distance
scales
an
alternative
proposal
for
what
creates
the
initial
fireball
by
the
way
is
the
socalled
failed
supernovae
scenario
by
stan
woosley
in
which
a
very
massive
star
at
the
end
of
its
life
collapses
to
a
black
hole
if
the
stellar
core
was
rotating
part
of
the
infalling
matter
will
be
temporarily
halted
because
it
is
supported
by
centrifugal
force
and
form
a
very
dense
neutron
torus
that
accretes
onto
the
black
hole
this
beast
may
spew
out
a
jet
along
the
rotation
axis
which
again
constitutes
relativistic
flow
the
rate
of
such
events
may
be
much
higher
than
that
of
neutron
star
mergers
but
the
flux
may
be
more
strongly
beamed
so
that
the
net
rate
of
bursts
observed
on
earth
stays
the
same
between
the
two
scenarios
but
the
energy
released
per
event
can
be
a
lot
less
in
the
failed
supernova
scenario
on
another
note
i
do
believe
that
the
distance
scale
must
ultimately
be
resolved
via
some
classical
astronomical
method
such
as
finding
counterparts
to
the
bursts
at
other
wavelengths
or
finding
a
definitive
signature
of
some
known
class
of
objects
in
the
distribution
of
positions
and
fluxes
theorists
have
historically
not
been
too
successfull
in
finding
the
distance
of
any
object
by
proving
that
there
is
only
one
possible
way
in
which
the
object
can
work
and
therefore
it
must
be

sf

did
an
article
on
a
similar
subject
quite
a
few
years
ago
the
question
was
if
an
alien
spacecraft
landed
in
washington
dc
what
was
the
proper
organization
to
deal
with
it
the
state
department
alien

the
defense
department
alien
invaders
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
illegal
aliens
the
department
of
the
interior
new
nonhuman
species
etc
it
was
very
much
a
question
of
our
perception
of
the
aliens
not
of
anything
intrinsic
in
their
nature
the
bibliography
for
the
article
cited
a
philosophical
paper
the
name
and
author
of
which
i
sadly
forget
i
believe
the
author
was
italian
on
what
constitutes
a
legal
andor
moral
person
ie
a
being
entitled
to
the
rights
normally
accorded
to
a
person
the
paper
was
quite
interesting
as
i
recall
if
we
encounter
a
civilization
that
is
suffering
economicly
will
we
expend
resources
from
earth
to
help
them
i
think
youd
have
to
be
very
careful
here
if
the
answer
is
yes
the
human
track
record
on
helping
those
poor
underpriveleged
cultures
does
underpriveleged
mean
not
having
enough
priveleges
is
terrible
the
usual
result
is
the
destruction
or
radical
reorganization
of
the
culture
this
may
not
always
be
wrong
but
thats
the
way
to
bet
with
all
of
the
deseases
we
currently
have
that
are
deadly
and
undetectable
what
will
be
done
to
ensure
that
more
new
deadly
deseases
arent
brought
back

that

people
who
criticize
big
government
and
its
projects
rarely
seem
to
have
a
consistent
view
of
the
role
of
government
in
science
and
technology
basically
the
us
government
has
gotten
into
the
role
of
supporting
research
which
private
industry
finds
too
expensive
or
too
longterm
historically
this
role
for
the
us
govt
was
forced
upon
it
because
of
socialism
in
other
countries
in
order
for
us
industries
to
compete
with
governmentsubsidized
foreign
competitors
the
us
govt
has
taken
on
the
role
of
subisizing
bigticket
or
longlead
rd
as
a
republican
i
abhor
the
necessity
for
our
government
to
involve
itself
in
technology
this
way
i
believe
that
market
forces
should
drive
technology
and
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
for
it
but
the
whole
world
would
have
to
implement
this
concept
simultaneously
or
some
countries
would
have
subsidized
rd
while
others
would
not
so
the
us
must
subsidize
because
everybody
else
does
this
sounds
a
lot
like
the
farm
subsidies
arguments
behind
our
gatt
negotiations
doesnt
it
but
this
role
of
government
subsidies
is
antithetical
to
costeffectiveness
the
general
idea
is
to
spend
money
on
new
technology
and
thereby
maintain
and
promote
our
technological
culture
despite
the
forces
in
the
business
world
like
the
dreaded
quarterly
earnings
report
which
erode
the
ability
of
us
industry
to
invest
in
new
technology
and
since
our
goal
is
to
spend
money
it
makes
little
sense
to
try
to
save
money
of
course
we
could
always
spend
our
money
more
wisely
but
everybody
disagrees
about
that
the
wisdom
should
be
its
interesting

some

in
my

this

quite
a

indeed
so
its
at

it
is
possible
only
because
mount

there
is
a
slight
equatorial
bulge

beyond
what
is

air

in

i

right

its

numbers
i

when
hst

it

in

perform
the

of
the

the
oms
engines
will
be
fired
for

now
the

is
a
heavy
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
oms
fuel
needed
to
fly
both
up
is
substantial
a
small
booster
carried
up
and
used
to
boost
hst
on
its
own
will
weigh
significantly
less
then
the
oms
fuel
required
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttle
for
a
given
orbital
change
from
what
i
understand
the
mass
margins
on
the
hst
missions
are
tight
enough
they
cant
even
carry
extra
suits
or
mmus
now
if
they
used
a
small
tug
i
would
bet
just
a
wild
guess
that
the
savings
on
amss
margin
would
allow
carrying
the
edo
pallet
extra
suits
more
consumables
parts
for
the
flaky
fgs
sensor
parts
for
the
balky
solar

and
still
enough
for
a
double
magnum
of
champagne
or
the
hst
could
even
get
placed
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
less
antenna
pointing
and

that

you

was
not

across

it
was
suspected
that
it
had
been
snagged
on

or
something
operational

to

the

is
there
any

to

the

many

however
at

the

be
beyond

where

a

cannot
easily
radiate
at
long
wavelengths
thus
the
grains
must
heat
up
more
in

to
radiate
the
energy

have
absorbed
moreover
the
iras
observations
had
a

grains
colder

they
heat
up

several

they
cool

then
stay

when

the

is
several

even
a

dramatically
raise

let
me
give
you
an
example
when
you
watch

they
have

for

you
accept
that
as
part
of
watching
if
you

you
can

there
is
a

out
there
you
cant

its
the

reasoning
that
limits
billboards
in
scenic

if
you

to
view

you
have
to
watch

you

still

if

they
use

what

a

coming

the

they
turned

it

massively

the

the

indeed
this
dictated
a
rather
odd
design
for
the
solar
arrays
since
they
had
to
be
retractable
as
well
as
extendable
and
may
thus
have
indirectly
contributed
to
the

why
not
design
the
solar
arrays
to
be
detachable
if
the

going

hst
what

are
some

just

you

one
of
the
design
requirements
was
that
there
be
no

mecahnisms
springs
explosive
squibs
gas
shocks
etc
used
for

this
was
partially
so
that
everything
could
be

back

to
put
it
back
in

partially
for

boldly
in
article
doug
loss
writes
analog
sf
magazine
did
an
article
on
a
similar
subject
quite
a
few
years
ago
the
question
was
if
an
alien
spacecraft
landed
in
washington
dc
what
was
the
proper
organization
to
deal
with
it
the
state
department
alien
ambassadors
the
defense
department
alien
invaders
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
illegal
aliens
the
department
of
the
interior
new
nonhuman
species
etc
it
was
very
much
a
question
of
our
perception
of
the
aliens
not
of
anything
intrinsic
in
their
nature
the
bibliography
for
the
article
cited
a
philosophical
paper
the
name
and
author
of
which
i
sadly
forget
i
believe
the
author
was
italian
on
what
constitutes
a
legal
andor
moral
person
ie
a
being
entitled
to
the
rights
normally
accorded
to
a
person
the
paper
was
quite
interesting
as
i
recall
this
is
a
whole
different
situation
if
aliens
were
able
to
get
here
prior
to
us
being
able
to
get
there
one
might
conclude
that
they
would
be
more
advanced
and
therefore
more
intelegent
that
we
are
however
if
we
get
somewhere
where
there
is
life
chances
are
we
wont
be
able
to
communicate
with
them
so
we
will
have
no
clue
as
to
weather
they
are
intelegent
or
not
i
think
youd
have
to
be
very
careful
here
if
the
answer
is
yes
the
human
track
record
on
helping
those
poor
underpriveleged
cultures
does
underpriveleged
mean
not
having
enough
priveleges
is
terrible
the
usual
result
is
the
destruction
or
radical
reorganization
of
the
culture
this
may
not
always
be
wrong
but
thats
the
way
to
bet
thats
a
good
point
i
hadnt
thought
of
it
that
way
my
question
however
was
more
along
the
lines
of
every
year
the
us
spends
millions
of
tax
dollars
and
giving
tax
breaks
to
individuals
and
companies
who
feed
the
poor
of
foreign
countries
while
thousands
of
our
own
people
sleep
on
the
streets
at
night
would
we
give
to
the
economicly
dissadvantaged
on
another
planet
if
we
hadnt
resolved
these
issues
on
our
own
but
your
comment
brings
up
another
good
question
over
the
years
we
have
decided
that
certain
cultures
need
improvements
the
native
americans
is
a
good
example
prior
to
our
attempt
to
civilize
them
the
native
american
culture
had
very
little
crime
no
homelessnes
no
poverty
then
the
europeans
came
along
and
now
they
have
those
and
more
if
we
encounter
life
elsewhere
do
we
tell
them
they
have
to
live
in
houses
farm
the
land

go

for

the

i

your

are

as
i

above
i
dont
have
exact
numbers
in
order
to
perform
the
reboost
of
the
hst
the
oms
engines
will
be
fired
for
a
long
period
now
the
shuttle
is
a
heavy
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
oms
fuel
needed
to
fly
both
up
is
substantial
a
small
booster
carried
up
and
used
to
boost
hst
on
its
own
will
weigh
significantly
less
then
the
oms
fuel
required
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttle
for
a
given
orbital
change
could
you
supply
some
calculations
you
might
check
some
recent
postings
that
explained
that
a
small
booster
as
suggested
does
not
now
exist
so
comparing
the
mass
of
something
that
doesnt
exist
to
the
mass
of
the
oms
fuel
seems
impossible
the
contamination
threat
also
remains
how
different
would
the
contamination
threat
of
a
small
manuevering
tug
be
from
that
of
the
shuttle
and
its
oms
engines
i
know
that
no
small
manuevering
tug
exists
but
maybe
one
could
soup
up
a
bus
does
anyone
out
there
have
the
declasified
specs
on
hte
bus
would
it
be
able
to
provide
enough
control
force
to
balance
the
hst
and
still
have
the
rocket
thrust
to
hurl
her
into
a
decent
high
orbit
or
the
hst
could
even
get
placed
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
less
antenna
pointing
and
longer
drag
life
longer
drag
life
i
can
understand
but
could
you
explain
the
antenna
pointing
sorry
that
should
be
intrument
pointing
whatever
it
is
the
problem
in
the

is
a

constraint
on

tell
me
about
it

the

can
be

are
moved
perfectly
well
utilizing

box
getting
them
both
working
is

desireable
so
as
to

plus
if
the

gets

you
could
be

dont

jump

you
helpful
suggestions
are
always
welcome
and
we
all

the
better
but
i
do
want
the
true
situation
to
be
described
clearly
and
correctly
lest
some
get
confused
regards

the
problem
is
noone
seems
to
have
the

when
the

was
planned
originally
at

there
was
enormous
concern
over
the

for
the

they

now
planned
for

an

have

an

obviously
that
is
coming

my

is
the

have

this

we

we

the

prior

the

had
very
little

this

we

an

in

are

things
by
assuming
were
talking
about
the
eastern
us
rather
than
the
whole
continent
given
that
those
were
radically
different
cultures
which
one
are
you
referring
to
if
we
encounter
life
elsewhere
do
we
tell
them
they
have
to
live
in
houses
farm
the
land
and
go
to
church
on
sunday
note
that
the
precolumbian
native
americans
east
of
the
mississippi
did
all
of
these
things
well
maybe
not
on
sunday
but
they
did
have
organized
religions
not
to
mention
cities
and
governments
if
you
are
judging
the
native
americans
by
the
tribal
culture
that
existed
in
you
might
want
to
read
an
account
of

what
precolumbian

the

design

each

would

tied

as
the

may

this
is
good

if

the

mission
can
act

either

the

spine
straightened
i
felt
a
momentary
panic
and
my
hands
tried
to
grab
onto
something
like
the
strap
keeping
me
firmly
against
the
floor
to
prevent
me
from
falling
i
remember
conciously
overruling
my
involuntary
motions
my
ears
felt
not
heard
a
rush
and
i
could
feel
fluid
moving
in
my
head
like
when
you
get
up
from
bed
while
you
have
a
cold
at
that
point
i
ceased
to
concentrate
on
my
physiological
response
since
i
had
some
science
to
do
i
was
busy
keeping
my
experiment
going
and
keeping
track
of
all
the
parts
during
the
return
of
gravity
and
subsequent
pullout
so
i
didnt
really
pay
attention
to
physiology
at
that
time
after
about
parabolas
i
discovered
that
i
was
performing
one
of
the
tricks
ive
discovered
to
keep
myself
from
getting
motion
sickness
i
was
keeping
my
head
very
still
and
moving
very
slowly
all
except
my
hands
and
arms
which
needed
to
be
in
rapid
concious
motion
for
my
experiment
during
the
pullout
to
parabola
my
queasiness
finally
started
to
get
to
me
and
i
had
to
use
one
of
those
airsickness
bags
i
was
basically
useless
for
the
rest
of
that
flight
so
i
went
to
the
seats
in
the
back
of
the
plane
while
my
partner
whom
i
drafted
for
just
this
purpose
kept
working
on
the
experiment
while
i
was
ill
he
was
a
vetran
vomit
comet
rider
one
of
those
anomalous
people
who
dont
get
sick
on
the
thing
i
didnt
think
of
it
as
a
constant
sensation
of
falling
so
much
as
like
swimming
in
air
its
very
close
to
the
sensations
i
feel
when

i
turn
my

down

up
jerry
and
what
is
the
motion
sickness
that
some
astronauts
occasionally
experience
ron
it
is
the
bodys
reaction
to
a
strange
environment
it
appears
to
be
induced
partly
to
physical
discomfort
and
part
to
mental
distress
some
people
are
more
prone
to
it
than
others
like
some
people
are
more
prone
to
get
sick
on
a
roller
coaster
ride
than
others
the
mental
part
is
usually
induced
by
a
lack
of
clear
indication
of
which
way
is
up
or
down
ie
the
shuttle
is
normally
oriented
with
its
cargo
bay
pointed
towards
earth
so
the
earth
or
ground
is
above
the
head
of
the
astronauts
about
of
the
astronauts
experience
some
form
of
motion
sickness
and
nasa
has
done
numerous
tests
in
space
to
try
to
see
how
to
keep
the
number
of
occurances
down
im
a
volunteer

biomedical

they
do
among
other
things
some
of
the

ron

i
was

called
the
preflight
adaptation
trainer
which
consisted
of
a
chair
on
a

the

was

could

what

convert

using

is

what

get

each

would

earth
as
the
case
may
be
this
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for

the
mars
mission
can
act
as
either
mother
ship
or
relay
point
for
the
probes
i
cant
see
the
need
for
a
single
big
expensive
heavy
mothership
except
for
voyager
style
flyby
missions
a
few
years
ago
i
did
some
calculations
on
a
grand
tour
space
probe
launched
by
a
saturn
v
in
at
the
timei
felt
that
the
idea
of
a
big
mother
ship
had
some
merit
the
voyagers
had
to
be
rather
small
lightweight
craft
due
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
using
weak
titan
iiicentaur
launchers
the
concept
i
examined
and
michaels
had
a
lot
in
common
with
the
british
interplanetary
societys
daedalus
project
for
sending
a
probe
to
barnards
star
ie
a
large
bus
spacecraft
carrying
several
smaller
probes
to
be
dispatched
when
the
ship
arrives
at
its
destination
the
saturn
v
supposedly
would
have
been
able
to
launch
a
payload
towards
jupiter
and
beyond
the
bus
could
have
included
far
more
powerful
camerastelescopesscientific
equipment
and
a
heaviermore
powerful
power
source
than
the
voyagers
as
there
would
be
no
limitations
on
weight
anymore
extremely
important
as
the
voyagers
had
to
perform
most
of
their
measurements
within
a
couple
of
weeks
before
and
after
planetary
encounter
and
usually
at
a
relatively
great
distance
the
smaller
probes
carried
aboard
might
have
been
based
on
the
real
voyagers
and
an
even
smaller
version
like
the
one
scheduled
for
launch
towards
pluto
in
the
early
century
and
would
have
been
released
at
various
points
during
the
mission
the
advantages
are
obvious
the
bus
would
have
carried
out
the
same
basic
jupitersaturnuranusneptune
mission
than
voyager
did
but
in
addition
two
subprobes
could
have
been
relased
at
saturn
examining
that
planets
south
polar
regions
before
moving
on
to
pluto
this
would
have
enabled
nasa
to
map
both
hemispheres
of
plutocharon
by
several
other
probes
could
have
examined
parts
of
the
jupitersaturnuranusneptune
systems
that
werent
examined
in
great
detail
by
the
voyagers
due
to
trajectoryrelated
factors
a
small
swarm
of
cameraequipped
miniature
space
probes
released
a
month
before
encounter
would
have
been
too

my

government
and
its
projects
rarely
seem
to
have
a
consistent
view
of
the
role
of
government
in
science
and
technology
basically
the
us
government
has
gotten
into
the
role
of
supporting
research
which
private
industry
finds
too
expensive
or
too
longterm
historically
this
role
for
the
us
govt
was
forced
upon
it
because
of
socialism
in
other
countries
in
order
for
us
industries
to
compete
with
governmentsubsidized
foreign
competitors
the
us
govt
has
taken
on
the
role
of
subisizing
bigticket
or
longlead
rd
this
definitely
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
entry
of
the
government
into
the
support
of
science
some
of
it
is
relevant
in
technology
there
was
little
involvement
of
federal
funds
or
except
through
support
of
state
universities
of
state
funds
for
scientific
research
before
wwii
the
us
research
position
had
been
growing
steadily
and
the
funding
was
mainly
from
university
and
private
foundation
funds
there
were
not
that
many
research
universities
but
they
all
provided
their
researchers
with
low
teaching
loads
laboratories
assistants
and
equipment
and
funds
for
travel
to
scientific
meetings
not
that
much
but
it
was
provided
and
a
university
wishing
to
get
a
scholar
had
to
consider
research
funding
as
well
as
salary
during
wwii
the
military
and
the
defense
departments
found
that
pure
scientists
could
do
quite
well
with
their
problems
even
though
they
were
not
exactly
in
the
areas
of
the
scientists
expertise
this
is
probably
because
of
the
research
mind
approach
which
is
not
to
try
to
find
a
solution
but
to
understand
the
problem
and
see
if
a
solution
emerges
this
works
in
stages
and
as
research
scientists
were
used
to
discussion
about
their
problems
the
job
got
done
the
military
realized
the
importance
of
maintaining
scientists
for
the
future
and
started
funding
pure
research
after
wwii
but
congress
was
unwilling
to
have
military
funds
diverted
into
this
investment
into
the
future
supply
of
scientists
and
set
up
other
organizations
such
as
nsf
to
do
the
job
it
also
set
up
an
elaborate
procedure
to
supposedly
keep
politics
out
also
the
government
did
a
job
on
private
foundations
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
act
to
support
research
the
worst
part
of
the
federal
involvement
is
that
in
those
areas
in
which
the
government
supports
research
the
university
will
not
provide
funding
and
in
fact
expects
its
scholars
to
bring
in
net
government
money
suppose
as
has
been
the
case
i
have
a
project
which
could
use
the
assistance
of
a
graduate
student
for
a
few
months
what
do
you
think
happens
if
i
ask
for
one
the
answer
i
will
get
is
get
the
money
from
nsf
now
the
money
at
the
university
level
is
a
few
thousand
but
at
the
nsf
level
it
comes
to
about
thousand
and
is
likely
to
keep
a
faculty
member
from
getting
supported
so
the
government
is
in
effect
deciding
which
projects
get
supported
and
how
much
also
the
government
decided
that
the
wealth
should
be
spread
so
instead
of
having
a
moderate
number
of
universities
which
were
primarily
research
institutions
the
idea
that
more
schools
should
get
into
the
act
came
into
being
and
instead
of
evaluating
scholars
they
had
to
go
to
evaluating
reseach
proposals
as
a
researcher
i
can
tell
you
that
any
research
proposal
has
to
be
mainly
wishful
thinking
or
as
now
happens
the
investigator
conceals
already
done
work
to
release
it
as
the
results
of
the
research
what
i
am
proposing
today
i
may
solve
before
the
funding
is
granted
i
may
find
impossible
or
i
may
find
that
it
is
too
difficult
in
addition
tomorrow
i
may
get
unexpected
research
results
possibly
i
may
bet
a
bright
idea
which
solves
yesterdays
too
difficult
problem
or
a
whole
new
approach
to
something
i
had
not
considered
can
develop
this
is
the
nature
of
the
beast
and
except
for
really
vague
statements
if
something
can
be
predicted
it
is
not
major
research
but
development
or
routine
activity
not
requiring
more
than
minimal
attention
of
a
good
researcher
i
believe
that
at
this
time
less
quality
research
is
being
done
than
would
have
happened
if
the
government
had
never
gotten
into
it
and
the
government
is
trying
to
divert
researchers
from
thinkers
to
plodders

the

the

thus
you

to

you
have

either

call
a

in

you
could
order

if

so
it
would
be
low

i

your

you
could

i
would
argue
that
they
are
challenging
even
today
including
for
the
dcx
program
keep
that
attitude
and
itll
be
a
couple
centuries
before
we
get
real
access
to
space
unless
another
country
without
all
that
baggage
comes
along
and
kicks
our
ass
in
the
space
race
i
do
not
recall
a
flightweek
specification
in
the
final
nasa
specs
for
the
space
shuttle
program
if
you
have
such
documents
i
would
find
them
most
revealing
and
interesting
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
only
people
touting
a
flight
per
week
flight
rate
were
people
on
capitol
hill
or
selling
books
to
the
general
public
or
nasa
hq
that
doesnt
give
the
rest
of
the
program
plausible
deniability
if
we
deceide
that
it
wasnt
worth
the
money
weve
spent
which
is
by
now
probably
a
lot
more
than
apollo
imho
political
statements
in
the
halls
of
the
us
congress
are
not
admissable
as
engineering
specs
because
specs
should
be
determined
by
nasadod
and
contractors
not
by
congressmen
senators
or
presidents
missions
are
defined
by
political
leaders
but
not
the
engineering
specs
yes
but
it
gets
sold
on
the
basis
of
the
political
statements
youre
saying
basically
that
it
met
the
engineering
specs
which
is
questionable
imho
so
its
a
success
never
mind
that
you
couldnt
get
the
funding
the
shuttle
eats
with
those
engineering
specs
in
a
thousand
years
the
shuttle
is
the
only
reusable
space
vehicle
this
automatically
qualifies
it
as
an
unparalleled
engineering
success
you
could
argue
about
its
political
success
but
engineering
wise
it
is
clearly
the
most
advanced
machine
ever
flown
i
argue
that
engineering
and
technical
data
for
hypersonic
flight
is
valuable
in
and
of
itself
shuttle
should
be
justified
or
criticized
on
the
basis
of
economics
you
can
get
hypersonic
flight
data
with
an
or
a
followon
type
vehicle
for
much
less
and
economics
and
engineering
are
interchangable
engineering
in
the
absense
of
economics
is
basically
just
physics
and
in
terms
of
physics
the
shuttle
looks
like
a
failure

to
the
then

i
was
disappointed
by
this
and
other
similar
statements
from
those
vocal
in
support
of
the
dcx
program
your
support
of
dcx
is
based
on
hopes
my
support
for
the
shuttle
program
is
based
on
record
the
shuttle
program
has
a
bad
record
i
once
had
hopes
for
the
shuttle
program
by
now
i
know
those
hopes
were
false
all
i
have
for
dcx
and
similar
and
dissimilar
experimental
vehicles
are
hopes
but
at
least
i
know
they
arent
false
hopes
yet
i
did
support
the
shuttle
way
back
when
it
didnt
do
nearly
what
it
was
supposed
to
its
time
to
move
on
to
something
that
might
do
the
job
of
orbital
delivery
better
or
at
all
i
think
that
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
i
do
not
object
to
dcx
it
is
visionary
i
originally
posted
i
like
the
dcx
idea
and
i
am
really
hopeful
that
itll
be
a
stunning
success
unfortunately
dcxers
are
not
willing
to
return
that
support
the
proven
shuttle
program
explain
why
you
folks
criticize
shuttle
when
shuttle
is
exactly
what
you
guys
need
in
order
to
learn
how
to
operate
dcx
onorbit
we
dont
want
to
learn
how
to
operate
on
orbit
it
launches
it
shoves
out
the
payload
it
lands
it
doesnt
waste
payload
hauling
up
and
down
edo
pallets
and
the
like
the
only
thing
to
be
learned
from
shuttle
is
how
not
to
build
a
launcher
finally
that
bit
about
the
proven
shuttle
are
you
hoping
you
can
tell
a
lie
enough
times
and
get
someone
to
believe
it
i
enjoyed
your
later
postings
regarding
the
comparisons
between
the
shuttle
and
the
soyuz
project
although
i
may
disagree
with
your
method
of
analysis
you
probably
will
disagree
with
mine
i
think
that
the
total
impact
of
the
shuttle
program
must
be
judged
on
the
scientific
and
technical
merit
not
on
timelines
and
schedules
do
you
agree
how
much
science
and
technology
could
have
been
done
is
the
money
spent
on
shuttle
had
been
spent
differently
as
for
now
we
need
to
stop
thinking
of
dcx
and
shuttle
as
mutually
exclusive

right

i

doubtless
it

the

that
its

for

arent

knock
any
zeroes
off
that

part
of
the
blame
for
this
must
be
placed
on
a
shuttle
program
that
consumes
many
annual
billions
of
the
er
free

available
space
cash
as
you
will
no
doubt
hear
from
many
correspondents
in
the
days

dcx
is
an
attempt
to
break
out
of
the
vicious
cycle
by
keeping
development
costs
low
and
flying
incremental
xplane
hardware
its
been
to
my
mind
incredibly
successful
already
theyve
built
a
complex
prototype
in
under
days
for
under
megabucks
i
would
have
been
extremely
skeptical
that
this
could
be
accomplished
in
america
never
mind
flying
the
thing
getting
a
successor
funded
or
building
the
dcy
im
sure
you
know
well
that
launch
costs
are
the
basic
problem
for
any
expansion
of
astronautics
i
dont
see
a
realistic
prospect
for
beating
down
those
costs
for
multiton
payloads
anywhere
else
if
the
dc
flops
itll
be
business
as
usual
in

the
nineties
and
the

will
look
just
like
the
seventies

eighties
a
prospect
too
depressing
to
bear
pegasus
represents
another
assault
on
the
problem
from
a
different
direction
it
doesnt
lower
costperpound
but
it
offers
an
orbital
launch
for
under
ten
megabucks
its
creating
its
own
market
for
small
payloads
i
read
the
magazines
and
ive
attended
the
last
two
iafs
there
are
plenty
of
engineers
with
paper
ideas
for
cheaper
launch
systems
some
of
them
as
good
as

better
than

there
is
no
sign
in
todays

that
any
of
these
designs
will
be
allowed
anywhere
near

line
you
could
change
my
view
on

if
you
could
prove
the
following
deleting
some
things
im
not
going

prove
tonight
that
the

need
not
go

to
allow

it
flies
alongside
the

dcy

its

will
be
useful
for
a

of
jobs

if

most
importantly
that
the

open
up

if
a

can

even
rather
than
the

costs
more

it
also

the
flip

happens
at

works
it
will
work

the
laws

change
how
much

is
redundant
thats
the
real
question
the
final
will
have
fully
intact
abort
throughout
the
entire

for

it
can
loose
about

still
land
safely
everything
we
do
in

has
zerodefects
issues
at
times
agree
everything
can
suffer

catastrophic

but
thats
not

shuttle
simply
isnt

that

did

we
have

what

shuttle
lifts

we
still
consider
it
payload
ten
saturn
flights
over
about
years
delivered
to
leo
roughly
the
same
as
shuttle
flights
over
years
of
course
saturn
lifted
more
than
shuttle
but
its
cost
to
orbit
in

dollars
was
higher
they
where
pretty
much
the

in

a

writes
some
new
information
has
been
discovered
recently
microscopic
fossils
have
been
found
in
very
old
rocks
the
theory
is
that
this
life
is
so
old
that
it
must
have
been
destroyed
during
the
periodic
intense
meteorite
bombardments
that
were
a
feature
of
the
early
solar
system
under
this
theory
life
originated
on
earth
multiple
times
between
multiple
meteorite
bombardments
and
therefore
the
conditions
for
the
creation
of
life
cannot
be
that
unlikely
this
was
all
badly
reported
in
the
news
there
is
no
evidence
that
signs
of
life
found
in
old
rock
predate
putative
planetsterilizing
events
rather
the
argument
was
that
if
life
arose
shortly
the
last
sterilizing
event
then
it
must
be
easily
formed
the
inference
was
that
life
originated
before
and
was
destroyed
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
however
even
this
argument
is
flawed
it
could
well
be
that
origin
of
life
requires
specific
conditions
say
a
certain
composition
of
the
atmosphere
that
do
not
last
for
long
so
perhaps
life
formed
early
only
because
it
would
have
had
no
other
chance
to
do
so
not
because
it
was
likely
that
life
would
originate
under
those
conditions

it
is
interesting
to

correspondance
that
some
believe
that
poor

is
not
capable
of
hosting
a
commercial

launch
business
for
many
reasons
it
can
and
we
here
on

lines
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
the

political
publicity
referred

the

had
its

the

the

the

location
also
has
some
strategic
advantages
in
the
form
of
necessary
infrastructure
and
controlled
air
space
to
support
the
project
just
because
the
folks
involved
have
not
done
the
traditional
aerospaceequivalent
of
vaporware
by
inviting
folks
out
to
kick
nonexistent
tires
but
have
been
merely
doing
their
job
to
prepare
for
launch
dont
think
that
nothing
has
happened
from
my
interactions
with
the
macdac
folks
i
get
the
impression
that
they
want
to
set
a
firm
believable
launch
date
based
on
vehicle
readiness
and
not
just
some
fiction
to
plug
a
space

i
believe
that
all
will
happen
this

dont

are

a
company
who
gauged
that
ill

would
lose

more

than
the

would
gain
might
decide

five
hundred
years
hence
i
must
admit
that
that
makes

of
my
personal
favorites
not
that
great
i
make
no
comment
on
nietzche
except
to
remark
that
he
was

interpret

cryptic
remark
as
you
please
some
people
have
appended
that
remark
that
nietzche
was
no
kant
with
thankfully
i
havent
read
enough
of
either
to
comment
although
everyone
tells
me
i
should
read
nietzche
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
greatest
philosopher
title
would
have
to
go
to
plato
since
the
whole
enterprise
of
philosophy
was
essentially
defined
by
him
although
he
got
most
of
his
answers
wrong
he
did
definitively
identify
what
the
important
questions
are
i
think
it
was
descartes
who
said
that
all
philosophy
is
just
a
footnote
to
plato
if
i
were
to
choose
which
philosopher
made
the
most
important
advances
in
human
knowledge
over
his
lifetime
thats
simpleit
is
aristotle
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
many
simply
refer
to
him
as
the
philosopher
regarding
nietzsche
hes
one
of
the
most
entertaining
although
since
his
ideas
were
so
fragmented
and
since
his
life
was
cut
short
it
is
doubtful
that
his
influence
as
a
philosopher
is
likely
to
be
very
extensive
years
from
now
theyll
probably
still
be
reading
him
in
years
though
as
for
modern
philosophers
i
would
have
to
say
that
kant
was
the
most
influential
since
he
had
such
a
strong
influence
on
almost
everyone
who
came
after
him
and
unfortunately
they
maintained
his
errors
and
amplified
them
over
time
i
would
say
that
the
most
influential
american
philosopher
would
have
to
be
dewey
but
as
to
the
question
of
what
philosopher
will
be
most
highly
regarded
in
years
it
may
very
well
be
ayn
rand
who
in
every
important
respect
was
american
but
was
born
in
russia
but
i

legged
creatures
kangaroos
are
the
specific
number
of
limbs
a
creature
has
is
an
accident
of
evolution
it
is
hard
to
make
changes
in
some
structures
the
panda
has
a
thumb
plus
as
many
fingers
as
its
ancestors
five
on
each
hand
but
the
thumb
is
a
modified
wristbone
rather
than
a
modified
finger
and
extra
fingers
are
much
more
common
than
extra
limbs
especially
fullyfunctional
ones
kangaroos
i
dont
think
so
if
you
take
the
view
that
the
tail
is
a
limb
then
monkeys
and
kangaroos
are
i
think
the
tail
is
a
different
kind
of
structure
grossly
enlarged
in
the
case
of
the
kangaroo
but
primarily
still
an
instrument
of
balance
rather
than
locomotion
i
dont
know
much
about
panda
thumbs
so
ill
ask
is
it
opposable
thermodynamic
considerations
of
surfacevolume
relationships
would
seem
to
dictate
that
active
complex
creatures
stay
in
a
size
range
similar
to
what
we
see
about
us
inch
tall
intelligent
aliens
seem
unlikely
as
do
those
much
larger
than
the
elephant
why
cant
a
lemur
or
a
brontosaurus
be
intelligent
yes
i
know
that
the
brontosaurus
is
a
mythical
beast
produced
by
putting
the
head
of
another
dinosaur
on
an
apatosaurus
but
so
far
space
aliens
are
also
mythical
well
i
wont
say
flat
out
that
they
cant
be
intelligent
but
ill
bring
a
couple
of
lines
of
argument
to
bear
to
try
to
show
why
i
dont
think
its
likely
first
let
me
say
that
when
i
say
intelligent
i
mean
complex
behaviors
in
response
to
novel
situations
on
a
level
with
or
greater
than
human
tool
use
and
tool
building
ie
assuming
suitable
manipulators
are
present
on
the
creature
to
allow
it
to
alter
its
enviroment
in
a
planned
way
it
will
do
so
thats
certainly
not
a
universal
or
complete
definition
of
intelligence
but
it
will
suffice
for
a
putative
technological
alien
now
no
one
knows
exactly
what
makes
a
brain
capable
of
thought
but
its
generally
accepted
that
one
of
the
criteria
is
a
certain
level
of
complexity
this
is
generally
determined
by
the
number
of
neuron
cells
and
their
interconnections
so
a
creature
the
size
of
a
lemur
wouldnt
have
enough
neurons
to
support
complex
thought
this
argument
is
considerably
less
clear
in
the
case
of
the
dinosaur
theres
room
for
a
large
brain
though
no
indication
that
one
ever
developed
one
reason
this
may
be
true
is
neuronic
speed
the
electrochemical
messages
that
trigger
neurons
require
time
to
propagate
this
makes
it
difficult
for
a
highly
complex
central
brain
to
coordinate
the
movements
of
very
large
creatures
so
theres
little
selection
pressure
for
such
brains
instead
a
simpler
distributed
network
evolves
this
doesnt
rule
out
intelligent
dinosaurs
but
it
points
in
that
direction
then
there
are
the
thermodynamic
arguments
a
tiny
creature
like
the
lemur
needs
to
eat
frequently
because
its
internal
heat
is
rapidly
lost
due
to
its
high
surface
to
volume
ratio
i
contend
that
a
creature
that
must
spend
most
of
its
time
and
energy
feeding
wont
have
the
time
to
develop
and
exercise
intelligence
that
argument
may
be
somewhat
weak
the
dinosaurs
problem
is
the
reverse
it
must
moderate
its
heat
production
because
its
high
volume
to
surface
ratio
makes
it
tend
to
retain
waste
heat
im
assuming
that
a
certain
temperature
range
is
optimal
for
chemical
reactivity
reasons
for
productive
neuron
function
so
creatures
would
tend
to
need
to
maintain
a
regulated
temperature
in
a
range
near
that
of
humans
if
they
are
carbon
based
that
tends
to
rule
out
cold
blooded
creatures
as
potential
homes
of
intelligence
some
people
contend
that
some
of
the
dinosaurs
may
have
been
warm
blooded
but
for
a
creature
the
size
of
a
brontosaur
its
activity
levels
would
have
to
be
restrained
or
it
would
be
prone
to
generate
an
internal
steam
explosion
from
the
waste
heat
whales
are
similar
size
but
they
can
reject
heat
to
the
ocean
a
much
more
efficient
sink
than
air
i
suspect
that
for
intelligence
to
manifest
itself
a
certain
degree
of
activity
in
interacting
with
the
environment
is
necessary
ie
monkey
curiousity
i
doubt
a
large

would
be
capable

take
this

ayn

was
not

born

educated
there
a

of

philosophy
reflects
not

a

education
but
a
reaction
against
certian
events
in
russia
while
she
lived
there
ive
heard
that
to
the
extent
there
is
a
division
of
modern
philosophy
between
the
continental
and
britishamerican
schools
rand
belongs
in
the
former
in

of
methodology
et

even
though
she
was
trying

say
things
that
would

have

the

are
partially

see
those

for

is
the

are
completely
reversable
why
is
there
going

it
deleted
the
main
effect
of
the
spherical

problems
with

was
to
drive
the

much
faster
when
they
use
the

deconvolution
software
on

from

be
ready
for

there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the

will

more

growth
in

has

though
youre

as
you
can
build

on

with

a

the
difference
in
quality
is
narrowed
quite
a
bit
anyway
fc
that
would
be
true
if
adaptive

worked
well
in
the
visable
fc
but
take
a
look
at
the
papers
on
the
subject
they
refer
to
anything
fc
up
to
microns
as
visable
i
dont
know
about
you
but
most
fc
people
have
trouble
seeing
beyond
microns
or
so
there
are
fc
reasons
to
think

will
not
work

how
one
could
get
every

to
agree

own

without

remember
that
not
every

follows
the
english
common
law
in
most
countries
for
most
of

it
was
probably
true
that
the

owned
everything
not
explicitly
owned
by

even
in

by
the
principle
enunciated
the

should
have

everything
when

wanted

mr

if
some

were
to

some

and
also
agree

such
a

might
work

it
would
hardly
be

some
of

think
it
might
make
sense
first
to
try
to
mobilize
public
opinion
against

also
to
use

the

was

talked
to
the

be
too
small
to

with
the
naked

so
small
and
visually
unimportant
anyway
he
suggested
that
the

would
approximate
that

are
you

think
about

what

do

writes
while
im
sure
sagan
considers
it
sacrilegious
that
wouldnt
be
because
of
his
doubtfull
credibility
as
an
astronomer
modern
groundbased
visible
light
astronomy
what
these
proposed
orbiting
billboards
would
upset
is
already
a
dying
field
the
opacity
and
distortions
caused
by
the
atmosphere
itself
have
driven
most
of
the
field
to
use
radio
far
infrared
or
spacebased
telescopes
hardly
the
keck
telescope
in
hawaii
has
taken
its
first
pictures
theyre
nearly
as
good
as
hubble
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
cost
in
any
case
a
bright
point
of
light
passing
through
the
field
doesnt
ruin
observations
if
that
were
the
case
the
thousands
of
existing
satellites
would
have
already
done
so
satelliets
might
not
seem
so
bright
to
the
eyes
but
as
far
as
astronomy
is
concerned
they
are
extremely
bright
i
believe
that
this
orbiting
space
junk
will
be
far
brighter
still
more
like
the
full
moon
the
moon
upsets
deepsky
observation
all
over
the
sky
and
not
just
looking
at
it
because
of
scattered
light
this
is
a
known
problem
but
of
course
two
weeks
out
of
every
four
are
ok
what
happens
when
this

circles
every

would

about

existence

we
cannot
observe
more
than
the

dimensions
we
know

dont

a
way
to
defend
that
statement
and
the
existence
of
these
unobservable
phenomena
simultaneously
tom
i
hold
that
space
cannot
be
curved
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
can
have
no
properties
of

we
can
only
speak
when
dealing

filling
the

to
say
that
in

of

space
becomes
curved
is
equivalent
to

to
the
contrary
the

have
not

they
are
kept
at
marshall

the
problem
in
recreating
the

is
not

it
is
finding
vendors
who
can
supply
vintage

and
the
fact
that
the

the

shuttle

the
shuttle
source
assumes
space
shuttles
and
titan
rockets
are
launched
yearly
thus
the
launches
would
add
less
than
to
the
total
stratospheric
chlorine
sources
the

is
minimal
global

average
total

be
decreased
by
this
is
much
less

with
volcanic

and
solar

the
influence
of
humanmade
chlorine
products
on

is
computed
by

calculations
to
be
a
decrease
in
globally
averaged
ozone
between
and
the
influence
of
the

shuttle
and
titan
rockets
on
the
stratosphere
is
negligible
the
launch
schedule
of
the

would
need
to
be
increased
by
over
a
factor
of
a

how
the

died
the

shuttle
launch
was
not
destroyed
in
an

this
is
a
welldocumented
fact
see
the
rogers
commission
report
for
example
what
looked
like
an
explosion
was
fuel
burning
after
the

tank
came
apart
the
forces
on
the

cabin
were
not
sufficient
to
kill
the
astronauts
never
mind
destroy
their
bodies
according
to
the
kerwin
teams
medicalforensic
report
the
astronauts
were
killed
when
the
moreorless
intact
cabin
hit
the
water
at
circa
and
their
bodies
then
spent
several
weeks
underwater
their
remains
were

and
after
the

team
examined
them
they
were

be
buried
using
the
shuttle
beyond
low
earth

you
cant
use
the
shuttle
orbiter
for
missions
beyond
low
earth
orbit
because
it
cant
get
there
it
is
big
and
heavy
and
does
not
carry
enough
fuel
even
if
you
fill
part
of
the
cargo
bay
with
tanks
furthermore
it
is
not
particularly
sensible
to
do
so
because
much
of
that
weight
is
things
like

in

the
shuttle

specialized

travel
between

taking

yet
another
concise
answer
by
henry
spencer
the
face
on
mars
there
really
is
a
big
rock
on
mars
that
looks
remarkably
like
a
humanoid
face
it
appears
in
two
different
frames
of
viking
orbiter
imagery
much
more
facelike
in
appearance
and
the
one
more
often
published
with
the
sun
degrees
above
western
horizon
and
with
the
sun
degrees
from
the
west
science
writer
richard
hoagland
has
championed
the
idea
that
the
face
is
artificial
intended
to
resemble
a
human
and
erected
by
an
extraterrestrial
civilization
most
other
analysts
concede
that
the
resemblance
is
most
likely
accidental
other
viking
images
show
a
smileyfaced
crater
and
a
lava
flow
resembling
kermit
the
frog
elsewhere
on
mars
there
exists
a
mars
anomalies
research
society
sorry
dont
know
the
address
to
study
the
face
the
mars
observer
mission
will
carry
an
extremely
highresolution
camera
and
better
images
of
the
formation
will
hopefully
settle
this
question
in
a

q
how
do
i
become
an
astronaut
a
we
will
assume
you
mean
a
nasa
astronaut
since
its
probably
impossible
for
a
nonrussian
to
get
into
the
cosmonaut
corps
paying
passengers
are
not
professional
cosmonauts
and
the
other
nations
have
so
few
astronauts
and
fly
even
fewer
that
youre
better
off
hoping
to
win
a
lottery
becoming
a
shuttle
pilot
requires
lots
of
fastjet
experience
which
means
a
military
flying
career
forget
that
unless
you
want
to
do
it
anyway
so
you
want
to
become
a
shuttle
mission
specialist
if
you
arent
a
us
citizen
become
one
that
is
a
must
after
that
the
crucial
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
demand
for
such
jobs
vastly
exceeds
the
supply
nasas
problem
is
not
finding
qualified
people
but
thinning
the
lineup
down
to
manageable
length
it
is
not
enough
to
be
qualified
you
must
avoid
being
disqualified
for
any
reason
many
of
them
in
principle
quite
irrelevant
to
the
job
get
a
phd
specialize
in
something
that
involves
getting
your
hands
dirty
with
equipment
not
just
paper

it
will
be
done
from

ground
for

seeable

degrees
in

field
plus
work
experience
in
another
seems
to
be
a

winner
be
in

do
not
get

radial
keratomy
or
similar
hack
to

nobody
knows
what
sudden
pressure
changes
would
do
to
rked
eyes
and
longterm
effects
are
poorly
understood
for
that
matter
avoid
any
other
significant
medical
unknowns
if
you
can
pass
a

physical
you
should
be
okay
if
you
cant
your
chances
are
poor
practise
public
speaking
and
be
conservative
and
conformist
in
appearance
and
actions
youve
got
a
tough
selling
job
ahead
trying
to
convince
a
cautious
conservative
selection
committee
that
you
are
better
than
hundreds
of
other
applicants
and
also
that
you
will
be
a
credit
to
nasa
after
you
are
hired
public
relations
is
a
significant
part
of
the
job
and
nasas
image
is
very
prim
and
proper
the
image
you
want
is
squeakyclean
workaholic
yuppie
remember
also
that
you
will
need
a
security
clearance
at
some
point
and
security
considers
everybody
guilty
until
proven
innocent
keep
your
nose
clean
get

overview
you
may
be
reading
this
document
on
any
one
of
an
amazing
variety
of
computers
so
much
of
the
material
below
may
not
apply
to
you
in
general
however
systems
connected
to
the
net
fall
in
one
of
three
categories
internet
usenet
or
bitnet
electronic
mail
may
be
sent
between
these
networks
and
other
resources
available
on
one
of
these
networks
are
sometimes
accessible
from
other
networks
by
email
sent
to
special
servers
the
space
and
astronomy
discussion
groups
actually
are
composed
of
several
mechanisms
with
mostly
transparent
connections
between
them
one
mechanism
is
the
mailing
list
in
which
mail
is
sent
to
a
central
distribution
point
which
relays
it
to
all
recipients
of
the
list
in
addition
to
the
general
lists
for
space
called
space
digest
for
internet
users
and
space
on
bitnet
there
are
a
number
of
more
specialized
mailing
lists
described
below
a
second
mechanism
is
usenet
netnews
this
is
somewhat
like
a
bulletin
board
operating
on
each
system
which
is
a
part
of
the
net
netnews
separates
contributions
into
hundreds
of
different
categories
based
on
a
group
name
the
groups
dealing
most
closely
with
space
topics
are
called
scispacenews
scispace
scispaceshuttle
sciastro
and
talkpoliticsspace
contributors
post
submissions
called
articles
in
netnews
terminology
on
their
local
machine
which
sends
it
to
other
nearby
machines
similarly
articles
sent
from
nearby
machines
are
stored
locally
and
may
be
forwarded
to
other
systems
so
that
an
article
is
posted
locally
and
eventually
reaches
all
the
usenet
sites
interested
in
receiving
the
news
group
to
which
the
article
was
posted
gateway
machines
redirect
the
usenet
scispace
group
into
internet
and
bitnet
mailing
lists
and
vice
versa
the
other
usenet
groups
are
not
accessible
as
mailing
lists
if
you
can
receive
netnews
its
more
flexible
interface
and
access
to
a
wider
range
of
material
usually
make
it
the
preferred
option
mailing
lists
space

why
does
the
shuttle
roll
just
after
liftoff
the
following
answer
and
translation
are
provided
by
ken
jenks
kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov
the
ascent
guidance
and
flight
control
training
manual
asc
gc
says
during
the
vertical
rise
phase
the
launch
pad
attitude
is
commanded
until
an
iloaded
vrel
sufficient
to
assure
launch
tower
clearance
is
achieved
then
the
tilt
maneuver
roll
program
orients
the
vehicle
to
a
heads
down
attitude
required
to
generate
a
negative
qalpha
which
in
turn
alleviates
structural
loading
other
advantages
with
this
attitude
are
performance
gain
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
improved
sband
look
angles
and
crew
view
of
the
horizon
the
tilt
maneuver
is
also
required
to
start
gaining
downrange
velocity
to
achieve
the
main
engine
cutoff
meco
target
in
second
stage
this
really
is
a
good
answer
but
its
couched
in
nasa
jargon
ill
try
to
interpret
we
wait
until
the
shuttle
clears
the
tower
before
rolling
then
we
roll
the
shuttle
around
so
that
the
angle
of
attack
between
the
wind
caused
by
passage
through
the
atmosphere
the
relative
wind
and
the
chord
of
the
wings
the
imaginary
line
between
the
leading
edge
and
the
trailing
edge
is
a
slightly
negative
angle
a
negative
qalpha
this
causes
a
little
bit
of
downward
force
toward
the
belly
of
the
orbiter
or
the
z
direction
and
this
force
alleviates
structural
loading
we
have
to
be
careful
about
those
wings
theyre
about
the
most
delicate
part
of
the
vehicle
the
new
attitude
after
the
roll
also
allows
us
to
carry
more
mass
to
orbit
or
to
achieve
a
higher
orbit
with
the
same
mass
or
to
change
the
orbit
to
a
higher
or
lower
inclination
than
would
be
the
case
if
we
didnt
roll
performance
gain
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
fly
a
less
complicated
flight
path
if
they
had
to
execute
one
of
the
more
dangerous
abort
maneuvers
the
return
to
launch
site
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
the
new
attitude
improves
the
ability
for
groundbased
radio
antennae
to
have
a
good
lineofsight
signal
with
the
sband
radio
antennae
on
the
orbiter
improved
sband
look
angles
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
see
the
horizon
which
is
a
helpful
but
not
mandatory
part
of
piloting
any
flying
machine
the
new
attitude
orients
the
shuttle
so
that
the
body
is
more
nearly
parallel
with
the
ground
and
the
nose
to
the
east
usually
this
allows
the
thrust
from
the
engines
to
add
velocity
in
the
correct
direction
to
eventually
achieve
orbit
remember
velocity
is
a
vector
quantity
made
of
both
speed
and
direction
the
shuttle
has
to
have
a
large
horizontal
component
to
its
velocity
and
a
very
small
vertical
component
to
attain
orbit
this
all
begs
the
question
why
isnt
the
launch
pad
oriented
to
give
this
nice
attitude
to
begin
with
why
does
the
shuttle
need
to
roll
to
achieve
that
attitude
the
answer
is
that
the
pads
were
leftovers
from
the
apollo
days
the
shuttle
straddles
two
flame
trenches
one
for
the
solid
rocket
motor
exhaust
one
for
the
space
shuttle
main
engine
exhaust
you
can
see
the
effects
of
this
on
any
daytime
launch
the
srm
exhaust
is
dirty
gray
garbage
and
the
ssme
exhaust
is
fluffy
white
steam
watch
for
the
difference
between
the
top
orbiter
side
and
the
bottom
external
tank
side
of
the
stack
the
access
tower
and
other
support
and
service
structure
are
all
oriented
basically
the
same
way
they
were
for
the
saturn
vs
a
side
note
the
saturn
vs
also
had
a
roll
program
dont
ask
me
why
im
a
shuttle
guy
i
checked
with
a
buddy
in
ascent
dynamics
he
added
that
the
roll
maneuver
is
really
a
maneuver
in
all
three
axes
roll
pitch
and
yaw
the
roll
component
of
that
maneuver
is
performed
for
the
reasons
stated
the
pitch
component
controls
loading
on
the
wings
by
keeping
the
angle
of
attack
qalpha
within
a
tight
tolerance
the
yaw
component
is
used
to
determine
the
orbital
inclination
the
total
maneuver
is
really
expressed
as
a
quaternion

the
first

attempt
to
send
a
spacecraft
to
venus
failed
minutes
after
launch
in
the
guidance
instructions
from
the
ground
stopped
reaching
the
rocket
due
to
a
problem
with
its
antenna
so
the
onboard
computer
took
control
however
there
turned
out
to
be
a
bug
in
the
guidance
software
and
the
rocket
promptly
went
off
course
so
the
range
safety
officer
destroyed
it
although
the
bug
is
sometimes
claimed
to
have
been
an
incorrect

it
was
actually
a

the

was
omitted
from

this

mariner
became
the
first
successful
probe
to
flyby
venus
in

was
placed
into

energy
for

from

the
probe
soon
died
when
its
batteries
ran
out
and
is
now
in
solar
orbit
it
was
intended
for
a
mars
flyby
with

mariner
the
sister
probe
to

did
reach
mars
in
and
took
the
first
closeup
images
of
the
martian
surface
in
all
as
it
flew
by
the
planet
the
probe
found
a
cratered
world
with
an
atmosphere
much
thinner
than
previously
thought
many
scientists
concluded
from
this
preliminary
scan
that
mars
was
a
dead
world
in
both
the
geological
and
biological
sense
mariner
was
sent
to
venus
in
it
reconfirmed
the
data
on
that
planet
collected
five
years
earlier
by
mariner
plus
the
information
that
venus
atmospheric
pressure
at
its
surface
is
at
least
times
that
of
earths
or
the
equivalent
of
being
feet
under
the
surface
of
an
ocean
mariner
and
were
sent
to
mars
in
and
expanded
upon
the
work
done
by
mariner
four
years
earlier
however
they
failed
to
take
away
the
concept
of
mars
as
a
dead
planet
first
made
from
the
basic
measurements
of
mariner
mariner
ended
up
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
when
the
rocket
launcher
autopilot
failed
mariner
the
sister
probe
to
mariner
became
the
first
craft
to
orbit
mars
in
it
returned
information
on
the
red
planet
that
no
other
probe
had
done
before
revealing
huge
volcanoes
on
the
martian
surface
as
well
as
giant
canyon
systems
and
evidence
that
water
once
flowed
across
the

did
return
the
first
closeup

of
the
venusian
atmosphere
in

unseen
details

the
fact

while
the
four

descended
by

towards

though
none
were
expected
to
survive
to

the
day

did
make
it
and
transmitted

minutes
on

before
its

failed
ranger
lunar
lander
and
impact
missions
ranger
and
were
test
probes
for
the
ranger
lunar
impact
series
they
were
meant
for
high
earth
orbit
testing
in
but
rocket
problems
left
them
in
useless
low
orbits
which
quickly
decayed
ranger
launched
on
january
was
intended
to
land
an
instrument
capsule
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
problems
during
the
launch
caused
the
probe
to
miss
the
moon
and
head
into
solar
orbit
ranger
did
try
to
take
some
images
of
the
moon
as
it
flew
by
but
the
camera
was
unfortunately
aimed
at
deep
space
during
the
attempt
ranger
launched
april
had
the
same
purpose
as
ranger
but
suffered
technical
problems
enroute
and
crashed
on
the
lunar
farside
the
first
us
probe
to
reach
the
moon
albeit
without
returning
data
ranger
launched
october
and
similar
to
ranger
and
lost
all
solar
panel
and
battery
power
enroute
and
eventually
missed
the
moon
and
drifted
off
into
solar
orbit
ranger
through
had
more
modified
lunar
missions
they
were
to
send
back
live
images
of
the
lunar
surface
as
they
headed
towards
an
impact
with
the
moon
ranger
failed
this
objective
in
when
its
cameras
did
not
operate
ranger
through
performed
well
becoming
the
first
us
lunar
probes
to
return
thousands
of
lunar
images
through
lunar
orbiter
lunar

photography
lunar
orbiter
through
were
designed
to
orbit
the
moon
and
image
various
sites
being
studied
as
landing
areas
for
the
manned
apollo
missions
of
the
probes
also
contributed
greatly
to
our
understanding
of
lunar
surface
features
particularly
the
lunar
farside
all
five
probes
of
the
series
launched
from
to
were
essentially
successful
in
their
missions
they
were
the
first
us
probes
to
orbit
the
moon
all
los
were
eventually
crashed
into
the
lunar
surface
to
avoid
interference
with
the
manned
apollo
missions
surveyor
lunar
soft
landers
the
surveyor
series
were
designed
primarily
to
see
if
an
apollo
lunar
module
could
land
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
without
sinking
into
the
soil
before
this
time
it
was
feared
by
some
that
the
moon
was
covered
in
great
layers
of
dust
which
would
not
support
a
heavy
landing
vehicle
surveyor
was
successful
in
proving
that
the
lunar
surface
was
strong
enough
to
hold
up
a
spacecraft
from
to
only
surveyor
and
were
unsuccessful
missions
the
rest
became
the
first
us
probes
to
soft
land
on
the
moon
taking
thousands
of
images
and
scooping
the
soil
for
analysis
apollo
landed
feet
from
surveyor
in
and
returned
parts
of
the
craft
to
earth
surveyor
the
last
of
the
series
was
a
purely
scientific
mission
which
explored
the
tycho
crater
region
in
viking
mars
orbiters
and
landers
viking
was
launched
from
cape
canaveral
florida
on
august
on
a
titan
rocket
the
probe
went
into
martian
orbit
on
june
and
the
lander
set
down
on
the
western
slopes
of
chryse
planitia
on
july
it
soon
began
its
programmed
search
for
martian
microorganisms
there
is
still
debate
as
to
whether
the
probes
found
life
there
or
not
and
sent
back
incredible
color
panoramas
of
its
surroundings
one
thing
scientists
learned
was
that
mars
sky
was
pinkish
in
color
not
dark
blue
as
they
originally
thought
the
sky
is
pink
due
to
sunlight
reflecting
off
the
reddish
dust
particles
in
the
thin
atmosphere
the
lander
set
down
among
a
field
of
red
sand
and
boulders
stretching
out
as
far
as
its
cameras
could
image
the
viking
orbiter
kept
functioning
until
august
when
it
ran
out
of
attitudecontrol
propellant
the
lander
was
switched
into
a
weatherreporting
mode
where
it
had
been
hoped
it
would
keep
functioning
through
but
after
november
an
errant
command
had
been
sent
to
the
lander
accidentally
telling
it
to
shut
down
until
further
orders
communication
was
never
regained
again
despite
the
engineers
efforts
through
may
of
an
interesting
side
note
viking
lander
has
been
designated
the
thomas
a
mutch
memorial
station
in
honor
of
the
late
leader
of
the
lander
imaging
team
the
national
air
and

museum
in
washington
dc
is
entrusted
with
the
safekeeping
of
the
mutch
station
plaque
until
it
can
be
attached
to
the
lander
by
a
manned
expedition
viking
was
launched
on
september
and
arrived
in
martian
orbit
on
august
the
lander
touched
down
on
september
in
utopia
planitia
it
accomplished
essentially
the
same
tasks
as
its
sister
lander
with
the
exception
that
its
seisometer
worked
recording
one
marsquake
the
orbiter
had
a
series
of
attitudecontrol
gas
leaks
in
which
prompted
it
being
shut
down
that
july
the
lander
was
shut
down
on
april
the
orbits
of
both
viking
orbiters
should
decay
around
voyager
outer

flybys
voyager
was
launched
september
and
flew
past
jupiter
on
march
and
by
saturn
on
november
voyager
was
launched
august
before
voyager
and
flew
by
jupiter
on
august
by
saturn
on
august
by
uranus
on
january
and
by
neptune
on
august
voyager
took
advantage
of
a
rare
alignment
to
slingshot
its
way
from
outer
planet
to
outer
planet
voyager
could
in
principle
have
headed
towards
pluto
but
jpl
opted
for
the
sure
thing
of
a
titan
close
up
between
the
two
probes
our
knowledge
of
the
giant
planets
their
satellites
and
their
rings
has
become
immense
voyager
discovered
that
jupiter
has
complicated
atmospheric
dynamics
lightning
and
aurorae
three
new
satellites
were
discovered
two
of
the
major
surprises
were
that
jupiter
has
rings
and
that
io
has
active
sulfurous
volcanoes
with
major
effects
on
the
jovian
magnetosphere
when
the
two
probes
reached
saturn
they
discovered
over
ringlets
and
satellites
including
the
predicted
shepherd
satellites
that
keep
the
rings
stable
the
weather
was
tame
compared
with
jupiter
massive
jet
streams
with
minimal
variance
a
great
white
spotband
cycle
is
known
titans
atmosphere
was
smoggy
mimas
appearance
was
startling
one
massive
impact
crater
gave
it
the
death
star
appearance
the
big
surprise
here
was
the
stranger
aspects
of
the
rings
braids
kinks
and
spokes
were
both
unexpected
and
difficult
to
explain
voyager
thanks
to
heroic
engineering
and
programming
efforts
continued
the
mission
to
uranus
and
neptune
uranus
itself
was
highly
monochromatic
in
appearance
one
oddity
was
that
its
magnetic
axis
was
found
to
be
highly
skewed
from
the
already
completely
skewed
rotational
axis
giving
uranus
a
peculiar
magnetosphere
icy
channels
were
found
on
ariel
and
miranda
was
a
bizarre
patchwork
of
different
terrains
satellites
and
one
more
ring
were
discovered
in
contrast
to
uranus
neptune
was
found
to
have
rather
active
weather
including
numerous
cloud
features
the
ring
arcs
turned
out
to
be
bright
patches
on
one
ring
two
other
rings
and
other
satellites
were
discovered
neptunes
magnetic
axis
was
also
skewed
triton
had
a
canteloupe
appearance
and
geysers
whats
liquid
at
the
two
voyagers
are
expected
to
last
for
about
two
more
decades
their
ontarget
journeying
gives
negative
evidence
about
possible
planets
beyond
pluto
their
next
major
scientific
discovery
should
be
the
location
of
the
heliopause

that
you
pick
up
some

about
i
recommend
these
works
after
you
first
study
some
of
the
books
listed

earth
at
the
time
events
were
unfolding
if
that
is
of
interest
to
you
space
missions
are
affected
by
numerous
political
economic
and
climatic
factors
as
you
probably
know
depending
on
just
how
far
your
interest
in
space
probes
will
go
you
might
also
wish
to
join

good
luck
with
your
studies
in
this
area
of
space
exploration
i
personally
find
planetary
missions
to
be
one
of
the
more
exciting
areas
in
this
field
and
the
benefits
human
society
has
and
will
receive
from
it
are
incredible
with
many
yet
to
be

cassini
saturn
orbiter
and

atmosphere
probe
cassini
is
a
joint
nasaesa
project
designed
to
accomplish
an
exploration
of
the
saturnian
system
with
its
cassini
saturn
orbiter
and
huygens
titan
probe
cassini
is
scheduled
for
launch
aboard
a
titan
ivcentaur
in
october
of
after
gravity
assists
of
venus
earth
and
jupiter
in
a
vvejga
trajectory
the
spacecraft
will
arrive
at
saturn
in
june
of
upon
arrival
the
cassini
spacecraft
performs
several
maneuvers
to
achieve
an
orbit
around
saturn
near
the
end
of
this
initial
orbit
the
huygens
probe
separates
from
the
orbiter
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
of
titan
the
orbiter
relays
the
probe
data
to
earth
for
about
hours
while
the
probe
enters
and
traverses
the
cloudy
atmosphere
to
the
surface
after
the
completion
of
the
probe
mission
the
orbiter
continues
touring
the
saturnian
system
for
three
and
a
half
years
titan
synchronous
orbit
trajectories
will
allow
about
flybys
of
titan
and
targeted
flybys
of
iapetus
dione
and
enceladus
the
objectives
of
the
mission
are
threefold
conduct
detailed
studies
of
saturns
atmosphere
rings
and
magnetosphere
conduct
closeup
studies
of
saturns
satellites
and
characterize
titans
atmosphere
and
surface
one
of
the
most
intriguing
aspects
of
titan
is
the
possibility
that
its
surface
may
be
covered
in
part
with
lakes
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
that
result
from
photochemical
processes
in
its
upper
atmosphere
these
hydrocarbons
condense
to
form
a
global
smog
layer
and
eventually
rain
down
onto
the
surface
the
cassini
orbiter
will
use
onboard
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
determine
if
there
is
liquid
on
the
surface
experiments
aboard
both
the
orbiter
and
the
entry
probe
will
investigate
the
chemical
processes
that
produce
this
unique
atmosphere
the
cassini
mission
is
named
for
jean
dominique
cassini
the
first
director
of
the
paris
observatory
who
discovered
several
of
saturns
satellites
and
the
major
division
in
its
rings
the
titan
atmospheric
entry
probe
is
named
for
the
dutch
physicist
christiaan
huygens

discovered
titan

drop
me
a
line
and
if
i
can
figure
it
out
ill
add
it
to
the
list
note
that
this
is
intended
to
be
a
reference
for
frequently
seen
acronyms
and
is
most
emphatically
not
encyclopedic
if
i
incorporated
every
acronym
i
ever
saw
id
soon
run
out
of
disk
space
the
list
will
be
posted
at
regular
intervals
every
days
all
comments
regarding
it
are
welcome
im
reachable
as
note
that
this
just
tells
what
the
acronyms
stand
for
youre
on
your
own
for
figuring
out
what
they
mean
note
also
that
the
total
number
of
acronyms
in
use
far
exceeds
what
i
can
list
specialpurpose
acronyms
that
are
essentially
always
explained
as
theyre
introduced
are
omitted
further
some
acronyms
stand
for
more
than
one
thing
as
of
edition
of
the
list
these
acronyms
appear
on
multiple
lines
unless
theyre
simply
different
ways
of
referring
to
the
same
thing
thanks
to
everybody
whos
sent
suggestions
since
the
first
version
of
the
list
and
especially
to
garrett
a
wollman
wollmangriffinuvmedu
who
is
maintaining
an
independent
list
somewhat
more
verbose
in
character
than
mine
and
to
daniel
fischer
dfispecklecmpifrbonnmpgde
who
is
maintaining
a
truly
huge
list
at
last
count
of
acronyms
and
terms
mostly
in
german
which
i
read
fortunately
special
thanks
this
time
to
ken
hollis
at
nasa
who
sent
me
a
copy
of
nasa
reference
publication
revised
space
transportation
system
and
associated

glossary
acronyms
and
abbreviations
a
truly
mammoth
tome
almost
pages
of
tlas
special
bonus
at
the
end
of
this
posting
you
will
find
a
perl
program
written
by
none
other
than
larry
wall
whose
purpose
is
to
scramble
the
acronym
list
in
an
entertaining
fashion

titan
iv
launches
aint
cheap
granted
but
thats
because
titan
ivs
are
bought
by
the
governemnt
titan
iii
is
actually
the
cheapest
way
to
put
a
pound
in
space
of
all
us
expendable
launchers
in
that
case
its
rather
ironic
that
they
are
doing
so
poorly
on
the
commercial
market
is
there
a
single
titan
iii
on
order
the
problem
with
commercial
titan
is
that
mm
has
made
little
or
no
attempt
to
market
it
theyre
basically
happy
with
their
government
business
and
dont
want
to
have
to
learn
how
to
sell
commercially
a
secondary
problem
is
that
it
is
a
bit
big
theyd
need
to
go
after
multisatellite
launches
a
la
ariane
and
that
complicates
the
marketing
task
quite
significantly
they
also
had
some
problems
with
launch
facilities
at
just
the
wrong
time
to
get
them
started
properly
if
memory
serves
the
pad
used
for
the
mars
observer
launch
had
just
come
out
of
heavy
refurbishment
work
that
had
prevented
launches
from
it
for
a
year
or
so
there
have
been
a
few
ct
launches
mars
observer
was
one
of
them
so
was
that
stranded
intelsat
and
at
least
one

the
total
quanity
of
uranium
dissolved
in

is
estimated
to
be
about
billion
tons
a
huge
amount
when
compared
with

i
hate
to
pour

water
on
this

currently
seawater
extracted
uranium
even
using
the
new

fiber

from

is
about
times
more
expensive
than
uranium
on
the
spot

uranium
is
very
cheap
right
now
around
right
now
there
are
mines
closing
because
they
cant
compete
with
places
like
cigar
lake
in
canada
where
the
ore
is
so
rich
they
present
safety
hazards
to
the
mines
who
work

plenty
of

for

uranium

would
come
on

before
uranium
reached

is
nonsense
supply
and

always
balance
what
changes
is
the
price
is
uranium
going

increase
in
price
by
a
factor
of
by
the

uranium

in

this

seemed

who
was

seemed

why
do

vertical

dont

miles

limit
noise
pollution
they
dont

wheels

just
turn
on

and
such
overly

well
to

yes

at

youre
learning
why
not
just
fall

like

the

use

just

parachutes
are
however
not
especially
practical
if
you

constellation
ssf
is
up

lets
step
back

functionality
we
want
microgravityvacuum
process
research
life
sciences
research
adaptation
to
space
spacecraft
maintenence
the
old
nasa
approach
explified
by
shuttle
and
ssf
so
far
was
to
centralize
functionality
these
projects
failed
to
meet
their
targets
by
a
wide
margin
the
military
and
commercial
users
took
most
of
their
payloads
off
shuttle
after
wasting
much
effort
to
tie
their
payloads
to
it
and
ssf
has
crumbled
into
disorganization
and
miscommunication
over
billion
has
been
spent
on
these
two
projects
with
no
reduction
in
launch
costs
and
littel
improvement
in
commercial
space
industrialization
meanwhile
military
and
commercial
users
have
come
up
with
a
superior
strategy
for
space
development
the
constellation
firstly
different
functions
are
broken
down
into
different
constellations
placed
in
the
optimal
orbit
for
each
function
thus
we
have
the
gpsnavstar
constellation
in
orbits
comsats
in
clarke
and
molniya
orbits
etc
secondly
the
task
is
distributed
amongst
several
spacecraft
in
a
constellation
providing
for
redundancy
and
full
coverage
where
needed
ssfs
main
functions
require
quite
different
environments
and
are
also
prime
candidates
for
constellization
we
have
the
makings
of
a
microgravity
constellation
now
comet
and
mir
for
longduration
flights
shuttlespacelab
for
shortduration
flights
the
best
strategy
for
this
area
is
inexpensive
incremental
improvement
installation
of
us
facilities
on
mir
shuttlemir
linkup
and
transition
from
shuttlespacelab
to
a
much
less
expensive
sstospacehabcomet
or
sstosifcomet
we
might
also
expand
the
research
program
to
take
advantage
of
interesting
space
environments
eg
the
highradiation
van
allen
belt
or
gasplasma
gradients
in
comet
tails
the
comet
system
can
be
much
more
easily
retrofitted
for
these
tasks
where
a
station
is
too
large
to
affordably
launch
beyond
leo
we
need
to
study
life
sciences
not
just
in
microgravity
but
also
in
lunar
and
martian
gravities
and
in
the
radiation
environments
of
deep
space
instead
of
the
protected
shelter
of
leo
this
is
a
very
longterm
lowpriority
project
since
astronauts
will
have
little
practical
use
in
the
space
program
until
costs
come
down
orders
of
magnitude
furthermore
using
astronauts
severely
restricts
the
scope
of
the
investigation
and
the
sample
size
so
i
propose
labratsat
a
constellation
tetherbolo
satellites
that
test
out
various
levels
of
gravity
in
supervanallenbelt
orbits
that
are
representative
of
the
radiation
environment

fred
replies
no
tommy
i
admit
that
there
are
such
things
as
market
failures
which
necessitate
intervention
by
other
than
capitalist
forces
to
correct
i
guess
your
understanding
of
this
market
failure
should
be
classified
under
phils
economics
on
the
level
of
century
medicine
since
you
apparently
completely
ignored
that
this
market
failure
can
as
easily
or
even
much
more
easily
be
attributed
to
government
intervention
failure
so
in
addition
to
a
strong
moral
argument
against
what
you
propose
there
is
also
a
strong
utilitarian
argument
namely
that
govs
destruction
of
wealth
through
confiscastory
taxation
and
redistribution
on
a
major
scale
has
made
significant
private
capital
investments
harder
to
make
i
note
that
you
make
no
such
case
as
you
claim
can
be
even
more
easily
made
yes
the
argument
can
and
has
been
made
that
current
government
policy
creates
even
larger
market
barriers
than
there
were
in
the
first
place
but
there
is
no
such
term
as
government
failure
since
the
government
can
change
policies
whenever
it
pleases
the
market
doesnt
do
that
and
is
governed
by
relatively
wellunderstood
forces
this
libertopican
bilge
about
moral
arguments
about

is

so
much
simplistic

the

to
admit
your

on

grounds
was
invalid
rather
than
pretend
you
were
actually
talking

feasibility
given
you
postings
i
cant
say
i
am
surprised
though
well
pardon
me
for
trying

continue
the
discussion
rather
than
just
tugging
my
forelock
in
dismay
at
having
not
considered
actually
trying
to
recover
the

from
this
process
which
is
at

trying

go
the
right

on

now
where
did

put

i
was

anything
i
am
so
pleased
you
are

no
it

nothing
like

note
that
i
didnt

it
was
perpetual

or
even
that
it
sounded
like
perpetual

the
phrase
was
sounds
almost
like
perpetual

which
i
at
least
consider
a
somewhat
different
propposition
than
the
one
you
elect
to
criticize
perhaps
i
should
beg
your
pardon
for
being
too
precise
in
my
use
of
language
the
physics
is
well
understood
the
energy
comes
from
fission
of
actinides
in
subcritical
assemblies
folks
have
talked
about
spallation
reactors
since
the
pulsed
spallation
neutron
sources
are
in
use
today
as
research
tools
accelerator
design
has
been
improving
particularly
with
superconducting
accelerating
cavities
which
helps
feasibility
los
alamos
has
expertise
in
high
current
accelerators
lampf
so
i
believe
they
know
what
they
are
talking
about
i
will
believe
that
this
process
comes
even
close
to
approaching
technological
and
economic
feasibility
given
the
mixed
nature
of
the
trash
that
will
have
to
be
run
through
it
as
opposed
to
the
costs
of
separating
things
first
and
having
a
different
run
for
each
actinide
when
i
see
them
dump
a
few
tons
in
one
end
and
pull
relatively
clean
material
out
the
other
once
the
costs
technological
risks
etc
are
taken
into
account
i
still
class
this
one
with
the
idea
of
throwing
waste
into
the
sun
sure
its
possible
and
the
physics
are
well
understood
but
is
it
really
a
reasonable
approach
and
i
still
wonder
at
what
sort
of
burning
rate
you
could
get
with
something
like
this
as
opposed
to
what
kind
of
energy
you
would
really
recover
as
opposed
to
what
it
would
cost
to
build
and
power
with
and
without
the
energy
recovery
are
we
talking
ounces

using
a

time
scale
i
see
the
real
reason
why
accelerator
breeders
or
incinerators
are
not
being
built
is
that
there
isnt
any
reason
to
do
so
natural
uranium
is
still
too
cheap
and
geological
disposal
of

looks
technically
reasonable

zijn
opgebouwd
rond
een
van
de

het
onderzoek
aan
de
zogeheten
compacte
objecten
de
eindstadia
in
de
evolutie
van
sterren
bij
de
samenstelling
van
het
programma
is
getracht
de
deelnemer
een
zo
aktueel
en
breed
mogelijk
beeld
te
geven
van
de
stand
van
zaken
in
het
onderzoek
aan
deze
eindstadia
in
de
eerste
inleidende
lezing
zal
dagvoorzitter
prof
lamers
een
beknopt
overzicht
geven
van
de
evolutie
van
zware
sterren
waarna
de
zeven
overige
sprekers
in
lezingen
van
telkens
een
half
uur
nader
op
de
specifieke
evolutionaire
eindprodukten
zullen
ingaan
na
afloop
van
elke

elijah
millgram
writes
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
were
wondering
where
the
expression
pushing
the
envelope
comes
from
anyone
out
there
know
every
aircraft
has
flight
constraints
for
speedaoapower
when
graphed
these
define
the
flight
envelope
of
that
aircraft
presumably
so
named
because
the
graphed
line
encloses
envelopes
the
area
on
the
graph
that
represents
conditions
where
the
aircraft
doesnt
fall
out
of
the
sky
hence
pushing
the
envelope
becomes
operating
at
or
beyond
the
edge
of
the
flight
or
operational
envelope
note
that
the
envelope
isnt
precisely
known
until
someone
actually
flies
the
airplane
in
those
regions
up
to
that
point
all
there
are
are
the
theoretical
predictions
hence
one
of
the
things
test
pilots
do
for
a
living
is
push
the
envelope
to
find
out
how
close
the
correspondence
between
the
paper
airplane
and
the
metal
one
is
in
essence
pushing
back
the
edges
of
the
theoretical
envelope
to
where
the
airplane
actually
starts
to
fail
to
fly
note
too
that
this
is
done
is
a
quite
calculated
and
careful
way
flight
tests
are
generally
carefully
coreographed
and
just
what
is
going
to
be
pushed
and
how
far
is
precisely
planned
despite
occasional
deviations
from
plans
such
as
the
early
first
flight
of
the
during
its
highspeed

sure
mary
can
tell
you
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
know
about
this
process

then
some
insisting

what
would
all
of
you
out
there
in
net
land
think
of
the
big
martin
mariatta
boeing
mcdonell
douglas
general
dynamics
lockheed
rockwell
getting
together
and
forming
a
consortium
to
study
exactly
what
the
market
price
pints
are
for
building
reusable
launch
vehicles
and
spending
say
to
do
that
recognizing
that
most
of
the
military
requirements
for
launch
vehicles
are
pulled
out
of
a
hat
somewhere
say
has
the
shuttle
ever
really
used
that
crossrange
capability
you
get
the
idea
figure
out
how
many
how
often
where
to
etc
then
taking
this
data
and
forming
a
sematech
type
company
bad
example
i
know
but
at
least
its
an
example
to
develop
between
and
craft
designs
then
to
take
all
of
those
designs
and
figure
out
exactly
what
the
technologies
are
and
demonstrate
those
technologies
in
order
to
eliminate
designs
that
cant
be
built
today
and
lets
say
that
this
portion
again
funded
by
the
gov
cost
about
million
and
from
here
all
of
these
companies
went
their
separate
ways
with
the
intention
of
taking
all
of
the
market
data
and
the
design
data
to
wall
street
and
saying
i
want
to
build
this
vehicle
and
here
are
the
numbers
that
show

fund
me
now
many
of
you
think
that
this
is
a
joke
but
i
have
it
on
good
authority
that
just
this
project
is
shaping
up
in
the
background
it
seems
that
the
aerospace
companies
have
learned
that
everyone
yelling
similar
but
different
things
ends
up
in
many
programs
that
do
nothing
much
and
get
canceled
nasp
nls
als
dcy
etc
they
need
to
work
more
in
the
japaneese
and
european
spirit
of
initial
cooperation
they
have
also
learned
that
design
requirements
that
are
phony
ie
some
generals
idea
of
what
a
space
vehicle
ought
to
be
ends
up
getting
chopped
up
in

it

breifing
recollections
the
following
are
my
thoughts
on
a
meeting
that
i
hugh
kelso
and
bob
lilly
had
with
an
aide
of
sen
patty
murrays
we
were
there
to
discuss
ssto
and
commercial
space
this
is
how
it
went
after
receiving
a
packet
containing
a
presentation
on
the
benifits
of
ssto
i
called
and
tried
to
schedule
a
meeting
with
our
local
senator
d
patty
murray
washington
state
i
started
asking
for
an
hour
and
when
i
heard
the
gasp
on
the
end
of
the
phone
i
quickly
backed
off
to
an
hour
later
in
that
conversation
i
learned
that
a
standard
appointment
is
minutes
we
got
the
standard
bozo
treatment
that
is
we
were
called
back
by
an
aide
who
scheduled
a
meeting
with
us
in
order
to
determine
that
we
were
not
bozos
and
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
material
and
to
screen
it
to
make
sure
that
it
was
appropriate
to
take
the
senators
time
with
that
material
well
i
got
allocated
hour
with
sen
murrays
aide
and
we
ended
up
talking
to
him
for
minutes
with
us
ending
the
meeting
and
him
still
listening
we
covered
a
lot
of
ground
and
only
a
little
tiny
bit
was
dcx
specific
most
of
it
was
a
single
stage
reusable
vehicle
primer
there
was
another
woman
there
who
took
copius
quantities
of
notes
on
every
topic
that
we
brought
up
but
with
murray
being
new
we
wanted
to
entrench
ourselves
as
noncorporate
aligned
ie
not
speaking
for
boeing
local
citizens
interentested
in
space
so
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
covering
the
benifits
of
lower
cost
access
to
leo
solar
power
satellites
are
a
big
focus
here
so
we
hit
them
as
becoming
feasible
with
lower
cost
access
and
we
hit
the
environmental
stand
on
that
we
hit
the
tourism
angle
and
i
left
a
copy
of
the
patric
collins
tourism
paper
with
side
notes
being
that
everyone
who
goes
into
space
and
sees
the
atmosphere
becomes
more
of
an
environmentalist
esp
after
seeing
the
smog
over
la
we
hit
on
the
benifits
of
studying
bone
decalcification
which
is
more
pronounced
in
space
and
said
that
that
had
potential
to
lead
to
understanding
of
and
maybe
a
cure
for
osteoporosis
we
hit
the
education
whereby
kids
get
enthused
by
space
but
as
they
get
older
and
find
out
that
they
havent
a
hop
in
hell
of
actually
getting
there
they
go
on
to
other
fields
with
low
cost
to
orbit
the
chances
they
might
get
there
someday
would
provide
greater
incentive
to
hit
the
harder
classes
needed
we
hit
a
little
of
the
get
nasa
out
of
the
operational
launch
vehicle
business
angle
we
hit
the
lower
cost
of
satellite
launches
gps
navigation
personal
communicators
tellecommunications
new
services
etc
jobs
provided
in
those
sectors
jobs
provided
building
the
thing
balance
of
trade
improvement
etc
we
mentioned
that
skypix
would
benifit
from
lower
launch
costs
we
left
the
paper
on
what
technologies
needed
to
be
invested
in
in
order
to
make
this
even
easier
to
do
and
he
asked
questions
on
this
point
we
ended
by
telling
her
that
we
wanted
her
to
be
aware
that
efforts
are
proceeding
in
this
area
and
that
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
results
from
these
efforts
are
not
lost
much
like
condor
or
majellan
and
most
importantly
we
asked
that
she
help
fund
further
efforts
along
the
lines
of
lowering
the
cost
to
leo
in
the
middle
we
also
gave
a
little
speal
about
the
lunar
resource
data
purchase
act
and
the
guy
filed
it
separately
he
was
very
interested
in
it
he
asked
some
questions
about
it
and
seemed
like
he
wanted
to
jump
on
it
and
contact
some
of
the
people
involved
with
it
so
something
may
actually
happen
immediatly
there
the
last
two
things
we
did
were
to
make
sure
that
they
knew
that
we
knew
a
lot
of
people
in
the
space
arena
here
in
town
and
that
they
could
feel
free
to
call
us
any
time
with
questions
and
if
we
didnt
know
the
answers
that
we
would
see
to
it
that
they
questions
got
to
people
who
really
did
know
the
answers
then
finally
we
asked
for
an
appointment
with
the
senator
herself
he
said
that
we
would
get
on
the
list
and
he
also
said
that
knowing
her
this
would
be
something
that
she
would
be
very
interested
in
although
they
do
have
a
time
problem
getting
her
scheduled
since
she
is
only
in
the
state
week
out
of
these
days
all
in
all
we
felt
like
we
did
a
pretty
good
job

does
anyone
have
any
info
on
the
apparent
sightings
of
vulcan
all
that
i
know
is
that
there
were
apparently
two
sightings
at
drastically
different
times
of
a
small
planet
that
was
inside
mercurys
orbit
beyond
that
i
have
no
other
info
the
sightings
were
apparently
spurious
there
is
no
planet
inside
of
the
orbit
of
mercury
the
idea
of
vulcan
came
from
the
differences
between
mercurys
observed
perihelion
precession
and
the
value
it
should
have
had
according
to
newtonian
physics
leverrier
made
an
extensive
set
of
observations
and
calculations
during
the
mid
century
and
simon
newcombe
later
improved
on
the
observations
and
recalculated
using
leverriers
system
of
equations
now
leverrier
was
one
of
the
codiscoverers
of
neptune
and
since
he
had
predicted
its
existence
based
on
anomalies
in
the
orbit
of
uranus
his
inclination
was
to
believe
the
same
sort
of
thing
was
afoot
with
mercury
but
alas
twere
not
so
mercurys
perihelion
precesses
at
the
rate
it
does
because
the
space
where
it
resides
near
the
sun
is
significantly
curved
due
to
the
suns
mass
this
explanation
had
to
wait
until
and
albert
einsteins
synthesis
of
his
earlier
theory
of
the
electrodynamics
of
moving
bodies
commonly
called
special
relativity
with
reimanian
geometry
the
result
was
the
general
theory
of
relativity
and
one
of
its
most
noteworthy
strengths
is
that
it
accounts
for
the
precession
of
mercurys
perihelion
almost
exactly
exactly
if
you
use
newcombs
numbers
rather
than
leverriers
of
course
not
everybody
believes
einstein
and
thats
fine
but
subsequent
efforts
to
find
any
planets
closer
to
the
sun
than
mercury
using
radar
have
been
fruitless

dump

this

its

know
if

the
real

why

is
that
there

natural

here

how
i

it
at

near

the

like
a

it

incompressible
so
wind
has
to

edges
as
the

thickens
the
more
the

bend
if
they

they

drag
if
you
squeeze

so
that
these

have

to

drag
is
reduced

remain
constant
for

three

options
as
guidance
to

in

on
the

a
low

a
midrange
option

and
a
high
option
of

will
be
considered
by
the

each
option
would
cover
the

an

on

the
station

team
is
following
to
develop
options
for

to
consider
gibbons
also
announced
that
the
united
states
and
its
international
partners
the
europeans
japanese
and
canadians
have
decided
after
consultation
to
give
full
consideration
to
use
of
russian
assets
in
the
course
of
the
space
station
redesign
process
to
that
end
the
russians
will
be
asked
to
participate
in
the

on
an
asneeded
consulting
basis
so
that
the

can
make
use
of
their

in
assessing
the

of
mir
and
the
possible
use
of

other
russian

the
us
and
international
partners
hope
to
benefit
from
the
expertise
of
the
russian
participants
in
assessing
russian
systems
and
technology
the
overall
goal
of
the
redesign
effort
is
to
develop
options
for
reducing
station
costs
while
preserving
key
research
and
exploration
capabilities
careful
integration
of
russian
assets
could
be
a
key
factor
in
achieving
that
goal
gibbons
reiterated
that
president
clinton
is
committed
to
the
redesigned

station
and
to
making
every
effort
to
preserve
the
science
the

he
also
is

his

that
there
are
only

many
available

him
and
the
lead
time
on
an

the
science
would

wonderful

so
far
and
they
are
sorting
the
serious
candidates
into
three
categories
based
on
cost
the
post
says
oconnor
described
the
design
derived
from
the
current
ssf
as
a
high
cost
option
i
believe
kathy
sawyer
the
post
writer
got
confused
here
i
listened
in
on
part
of
oconnors
briefing
to
the
press
on
monday
and
in
one
part
of
the
briefing
oconnor
talked
about
how
the
white
house
wants
three
options
sorted
by
cost
low
medium
and
high
in
another
part
of
the
briefing
he
discussed
the
three
teams
he
has
formed
to
look
at
three
options
ssf
derivative
larc
modular
buildup
with
msfc
and
single
launch
core
wingless
orbiter
jsc
later
in
response
to
a
reporters
question
i
thought
i
heard
oconnor
say
the
option
based
on
a
ssf
redesign
was
a
moderate
cost
option
in
between
low
high
cost
options
not
the
high
cost
option
as
sawyer
wrote
the
article
goes
on
to
describe
the
other
two
options
as
one
features
modules
that
could
gradually
be
fitted
together
in
orbit
similar
to
the
russian
mir
the
other
is
a
core
facility
that
could
be
deposited
in
orbit
in
a
single
launch
like
skylab
that
option
would
use
existing
hardware
from
the
space
shuttle
the
fuselage
for
example
in
its
basic
structure
the
last
sentence
in
the
article
contradicts
the
title
the
first
paragraph
the
sentence
reads
he
oconnor
said
a

version
of
the

is

when
work
for

is
performed

the
center
skims
off
a
portion
which
goes
into
what
amounts
to
a
slush
fund
this
money
is
used
to
fund
work
the
center
manager
wants
to
fund
this
sum
is
estimated
to
be
over
a

about
that
of

cost

fully
billion
wont
be

congress
has
never

the

they
look

they
are
getting

the

they
are
paying

note

my
dear
friends
your
mixing
fact
and
fiction
here
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
i
first
read
this
in
your
posting
i
talked
with
one
of
the
cost
experts
here
in
space
station
at
headquarters
if
you
wondering
why
i
didnt
post
a
response
immediately
i
do
have
a
real
job
im
supposed
to
be
doing
here
at
headquarters
digging
up
old
khz
data
looking
into
sherzerkyger
claims
rates
pretty
low
on
the
totem
pole
of
priority
also
i
spent
last
weekend
in
kansas
city
at
the
national
science
teachers
association
conference
extolling
the
virtues
of
ssf
to
science
teachers
first
off
yes
the
concept
of
center
tax
or
wrap
does
exist
if
i
recall
the
numbers
correctly
the
total
tax
for
the
ssf
program
for
this
fiscal
year
is
around
million
this
was
computed
by
adding
up
the
and
center
taxes
with
the
ssf
budget
for
this
fiscal
year
at
billion
my
calculater
says
the
tax
percentage
is
over
the
life
of
the
ssf
program
using
your
figure
of
billion
for
the
cost
of
ssf
a
tax
at
a
rate
comes
to
million
this
is
alot
less
than
billion
but
i
will
concede
its
still
an
appreciable
amount
of
pocket
change
i
should
note
that
your
estimate
of
the
tax
rate
at
could
be
close
to
the
actual
rate
the
tax
is
only
charged
on
funds
that
are
spent
at
the
center
kind
of
like
mcdonalds
at
some
states
where
you
do
have
to
pay
sales
tax
if
you
eat
the
food
at
the
restaurant
but
you
dont
if
you
get
it
takeout
for
example
at
the
vast
bulk
of
the
funds
we
receive
go
to
the
rocketdyne
contract
and
are
not
subject
to
the
center
tax
i
dont
have
the
numbers
in
front
of
me
but
id
guess
at
least
of
the
funds
go
to
rocketdyne
so
you
could
be
right
about
a
tax
rate
of
but
its
only
applied
to
funds
spent
at
the
center
and
not
to
the
prime
contracts
this
leads
to
the
obvious
question
what
is
the
government
doing
with
ssf
funds
that
dont
go
to
the
prime
contractors
ie
ok
gets
a
slice
of
the
billion
pie
a
big
portion
of
this
slice
goes
to
rocketdyne
what
happens
to
the
balance
of
the
funds
which
arent
eaten
up
by
the
center
tax
at
we
call
these
funds
we
spend
inhouse
supporting
development
funds
as
they
are
supporting
the
development
work
done
by
rocketdyne
we
have
used
these
funds
to
setup
our
own
testbed
to
checkout
the
electrical
power
system
architecture
our
testbed
has
a
real
life
solar
array
field
left
over
from
solar
cell
research
research
a
few
years
back
with
leadacid
car
batteries
to
simulate
the
nickelhydrogen
batteries
on
ssf
dc
switchgear
dcdc
converter
units
and
simulated
loads
data
from
the
testbed
was
used
in
a
recent
change
evaluation
involving
concerns
about
the
stability
of
the
power
system
we
have
also
used
the
supporting
development
money
to
purchase
nickel
hydrogen
batteries
which
are
on
life
testing
at
both
lewis
and
the
crane
naval
facility
in
indiana
as
a
side
point
of
the
battery
cells
on
test
recently
hit
the
four
year
life
test
milestone
cells
have
completed
to
cycles
the
onorbit
batteries
go
through
cycles
per
year
as
a
final
example
my
home
division
at
lewis
used
the
supporting
development
funds
to
purchase
personal
computers
and
work
stations
for
performing
system
analyses
like
modeling
of
the
performance
of
the
electrical
power
system
availability
calculations
using
a
montecarlo
simulation
setting
up
a
database
with
information
on
weight
of
the
power
system
elements
finally
the
money
raised
by
the
tax
does
not
all
go
into
a
slush
fund
at
lewis
the
director
does
control
a
small
discretionary
fund
each
year
any
individual
at
lewis
can
submit
a
proposal
to
the
director
to
get
money
from
this
fund
to
look
at
pretty
much
anything
within
the
lewis
charter
most
of
the
tax
however
goes
to
fund
the
general
services
at
the
center
like
the
library
the
central
computer
services
division
the
contractor
who
removes
the
snow
etc
thus
it
is
rather
difficult
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
ssf
budget
doesnt
go
for
ssf
activities
to
get
an
accurate
figure
you
would
have
to
take
the
annual
expenditure
for
the
library
for
example
and
then
divide
by
the
amount
of
the
library
funds
used
to
support
ssf
which
would
be
hard
to
compute
by
itself
how
would
you
figure
out
what
percentage
of
the
bill
for
aviation
week
for
year
is
billable
to
ssf
would
you
base
it
on
the
personhours
ssf
employees
spend
reading
avweek
versus
the
rest
of
the
center
personnel
you
would
then
have
to
compare
this
estimate
of
the
ssf
portion
of
the
library
expense
with
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
goes
to
support
the
library
who
knows
maybe
ssf
overpays
on
the
tax
to
run
the
library
but
we
underpay
for
snow
removal
talk
about
a
burecratic
nightmare
my
last
point
is
that
i
cant
believe
your
claim
that
congress
has
never
heard
of
the
term
center
tax
unfortunately
all
of
the
nasa
testimony
before
congress
isnt
on
a
computer
so
i
cant
do
a
simple
word
search
someplace
to
prove
you
wrong
but
surely
in
some
gao
audit
somewhere
these
nasa
cost
methods
were
documented

sdio
is
passing
a
tin
cup
among
its
sister
government
agencies
sdio
originally
funded
ssto
research
as
a
way
to
cut
the
costs
for
orbital
deployments
of
spacebased
sensors
and
weapns
however
recent
changes
in
sdis
political
marching
orders
and
budget
cuts
have
made
ssto
less
of
a
priority
today
the
agency
is
more
interested
in
using
dcx
as
a
step
towards
a
lowcost
reusable
sounding
rocket
sdio
has
already
done
briefings
to
other
government
agencies
said
col
simon
pete
worden
sdios
deputy
for
technology
but
worden
declined
to
say
how
much
the
agencies
would
have
to
pony
up
for
the
program
i
didnt
make
colonel
by
telling
my
contractors
how
much
money
i
have
available
to
spend
he
quipped
at
a
press
conference
at
mcdonnell
douglas
astronautics
headquarters
while
sdio
has
lowered
its
sights
on
the
programs
orbital
objective
agency
officials
hail
the
dcx
as
an
example
of
the
better
faster
cheaper
approach
to
hardware
development
the
agency
believes
this
philosophy
can
produce
breakthroughs
that
leapfrog
ahead
of
evolutionary
technology
developments
worden
said
the
dcx
illustrates
how
a
build
a
little
test
a
little
approach
can
produce
results
on
time
and
within
budget
he
said
the
program
which
went
from
concept
to
hardware
in
around
months
showed
how
todays
engineers
could
move
beyond
the
miracles
of
our
parents
time
the
key
is
management
worden
said
sdio
had
a
very
light
hand
on
this
project
we
had
only
one
overworked
major
jess
sponable
although
the
next
phase
may
involve
more
agencies
worden
said
lean
management
and
a
sense
of
governmentindustry
partnership
will
be
crucial
its
essential
we
do
not
end
up
with
a
large
management
structure
where
the
price
goes
up
exponentially
sdios
approach
also
won
praise
from
two
california

of

joking
that

rohrbacher

that
the

would

the

rohrbacher

said
charles

mcdonnell

senior

for

systems
you
need
strong
government
investments
while
the
government
and
industry
continue
to
differ
on
funding
for
the
dcxa
they
agree
on
continuing
an
incremental
approach
to
development
citing
corporate
history
they
liken
the
process
to
douglas

dc
aircraft
just
as
two
earlier

flight
tests
this
summer

expand
the

with

increasing
speed
and

the
first

will
reach
feet
and
demonstrate
hovering
verticle
takeoff
and

the
second
series
will
send
the
unmanned

the
third
and
final
series
will
take
the
craft
up
to

maneuvers
will
become
more

on

the

tests
will
include
a
pitchover
manever
that
rotates
the

if

engine
technology
will
become
a
key
consideration
this
engine
would
have
more
thrust
than
the
pratt
whitney
engines
used
on
the
dcx
each
motor
uses
liquid
hydrogen
and
liquid
oxygen
propellants
to
generate
up
to
pounds
of
thrust
based
on
the
engine
used
in

the

champer
designed
for

operation
and
threetoon

it
also
is
designed
for

and

worden
said
future
singlestage
rockets
could
employ
tripropellant
engine
technology
developed
in
the
former
soviet
union
the
resulting
engines
could
burn
a
dense
hydrocarbon
fuel
at
takeoff
and
then
switch
to
liquid
hydrogen
at
higher
altitudes
the
mechanism
for
the

gibbons
also
announced
that
the
united

and
its
international
partners
the
europeans
japanese
and
canadians
have
decided
after
consultation
to
give
full
consideration
to
use
of
russian
assets
in
the
course
of
the
space
station
redesign
process
to
that
end
the
russians
will
be
asked
to
participate
in
the
redesign
effort
on
an
asneeded
consulting
basis
so
that
the

team
can
make
use
of
their
expertise
in
assessing
the
capabilities
of
mir
and
the
possible
use
of
mir
and
other
russian
capabilities
and

the
us
and
international
partners
hope
to
benefit
from
the
expertise
of
the
russian
participants
in
assessing
russian
systems
and
technology
the
overall
goal
of
the
redesign
effort
is
to
develop
options
for
reducing
station
costs
while
preserving
key
research
and
exploration
capabilitiaes
careful
integration
of
russian
assets
could
be
a
key
factor
in
achieving
that
goal
gibbons
reiterated
that
president
clinton
is
committed
to
the

space
station
and
to
making
every
effort
to
preserve
the
science
the

and
the

that
the

represents
however
he
also
is
committed
to
a

that
is

of
complaintssomething
between
feelings
regarding
nicks
method
and
judgments
about
his
meaning
t
maybe
id
get
it
if
you
said
what
the
complaints
are
about
rather
than
doing
the
same
things
that
you
mean
to
complain
about
when
you
trash
people
how
am
i
supposed
to
read
that
as
trashing
people
is
bad
f
gee
funny
that
you
get
it
now
then
deliberate
obtuseness
perhaps
freds
issue
nicks
alleged
trashing
of
others
i
only
got
it
when
you
stopped
trashing
and
made
your
point
patently
instead
of
allegorically
that
was
my
point
all
along
fred
not
only
do
you
do
the
same
thing
on
the
net
honestly
reporting
your
ideas
on
matters
of
policy
and
projects
in
space
but
your
response
was
just
baiting
not
even
part
of
a
debate
i
have
yet
to
see
nick
enter
into
anything
remotely
resembling
a
debate
i
see
him
flame
anyone
or
anything
who
disagrees
with
the
one
true
szabo
plan
i
see
him
attacking
people
calling
them
lazy
bastard
because
they
had
the
temerity
to
disagree
with
the
almight
nick
i
see
him
questioning
peoples
ethics
again
because
they
had
the
temerity
to
disagree
with
lord
god
szabo
but
debate
bwaaaaahhhaaaa
im
glad
you
can
laugh
since
your
ratio
of
debateinsult
is
about
the
same
not
even
close
tommy
and
generally
only
when
im
dealing
with
someone
like
nick
i
see
we
are
dealing
with
a
problem
in
a
conflict
of
interpretations
not
least
of
which
is
your
belief
that
only
you
can
adequately
judge
what
is
and
is
not
debate
suffice
to
say
that
i
disagree
with
you
on
that
last
point
why
dont
you
take
a
poll
fred
if
you
want
some
psuedoobjective
pointofview
and
as
usual
you
defend
your
insults
with
he
started
it
yeah
i
took
some
of
his
research
and
called
it
my
own
but
he
started
it
so
what
if
i
stole
his
car
he
stole
my
lawnmower
first
besides
that
i
think
its
still
open
to
interpretation
whether
nick
actually
did
start
it
so
your
defense
besides
being
lame
and
contradicting
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
in
which
it
occurs
may
not
even
apply
anyway
your
defense
reminds
me
of
the
guy
that
broke
the
borrowed
tool
i
never
borrowed
it
i
already
gave
it
back
and
it
was
broken
when
you
gave
it
to
me
make
up
yer
mind
fred
im
not
convinced
that
people
are
necessary
in
all
parts
of
every
space
based
process
and
your
response
doesnt
tell
me
a
thing
about
the
reasons
why
you
think
they
should
be
except
to
impune
the
motives
of
the
person
with
a
divergent
opinion
who
said
i
think
they
should
be
tommy
show
me
a
note
where
i
said
that
and
ill
eat
this
terminal
see
below
fred
fred
i
cocluded
that
you
did
since
you
took
issue
with
it
the
fact
that
my
conclusion
was
incorrect
ie
that
you
were
taking
issue
with
something
different
is
evidence
that
your
communication
style
is
confusing
or
evidence
that
your
reading
and
comprehension
style
are
inadequate
first
i
try
to
address
what
i
think
you
meant
for
which
i
am
rewarded
with
a
denial
of
sorts
and
a
smart
remark
then
i
point
out
that
i
am
not
clear
what
you
did
mean
rather
than
risking
your
childish
ire
wrongly
interpreting
you
a
second
time
and
im
stupid
for
it
i
just
cant
win
can
i
fred
youve
got
a
great
point
here
somewhere
its
just
that
between
stupid
people
that
you
must
insult
and
your
jealous
guarding
of
your
valuable
opinions
you
never
actually
get
around
to
making
it
please
quote
the
it
i
took
issue
with
i
believe
you
will
see
if
you
look
that
what
i
was
and
am
taking
issue
with
is
mr
szabos
idea
that
the
manned
program
should
be
scrapped
until
such
time
as
his
toasterbased
infrastructure
is
finished
all
hail
the
szabo
plan
fred
issue
nicks
alleged
meaning
too
bad
the
plan
only
exists
in
your
mind
instead
of
nicks
or
you
would
have
a
really
good
point
instead
you
have
provided
a
good
reason
to
ignore
your
insults
since
they
are
based
on
incorrect
interpretations
that
you
have
made
about
others
forgive
me
for
giving
your
insults
more
meaning
than
they
ever
should
have
had
my
reading
of
what
nick
actually
said
is
that
people
arent
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
your
taking
issue
with
his
opinions
regarding
people
in
the
space
program
i
read
as
people
are
required
in
all
parts
of
all
space
processes
so
help
me
out
here
fred
since
im
so
patently
stupid
did
you
read
nick
wrong
or
are
you
going
to
eat
your
terminal
now
if
the
latter
i
sure
hope
its
one
of
those
cheeto
and
string
models
that
all
the
computer
mags
have
been
raving
about
the
point
is
i
am
not
stupid
because
of
your
incorrect
assumption
id
only
be
stupid
if
i
insulted
you
for
having
made
it
but
alas
thats
your
job
fred
and
finally
your
style
is
confusing
since
you
tried
to
make
two
points
simultaneously
with
an
allegoryinsult
sadly
one
point
addressed
a
plan
that
only
existed
in
your
mind
and
the
other
took
issue
with
behaviors
that
you
do
as
much
as
anyone
more
deliberate
lack
of
understanding
tommy
no
no
i
finally
got
it
you
dont
like
the
plan
that
nicks
posts
made
you
imagine
and
you
dont
like
nicks
obnoxious
behavior
even
though
its
no
worse
than
your
own
thanks
for
taking
the
time
with
someone
as
dense
as
myself
if
you
have
a
problem
with
nicks
delivery
address
that
the
way
you
bait
youre
perpetuating
the
lack
of
discourse
that
you
complain
of
no
tommy
the
bait
is
that
which
elicits
the
response
nick
baits
i
just
flame
him
for
being
an
obnoxious
fool
i
dont
really
care
who
started
it
i
read
this
list
to
get
information
and
others
views
on
the
issues
to
which
it
was
dedicated
not
to
be
your
mom
he
started
it
no
he
did
or
to
hear
about
why
nick
is
a
very
bad
guy
if
you
think
flaming
is
bad
stop
flaming
or
at
least
get
to
the
point
in
the
first
post
instead
of
explaining
yourself
all
the
time
thats
nice
tommy
when
you
pay
me
to
post
to
the
net
you
can
complain
about
not
getting
your
moneys
worth
perhaps
if
you
werent
deliberately
too
thick
to
get
the
point
the
first
time
i
wouldnt
have
to
waste
time
explaining
myself
all
the
time
of
course
socrates
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
think
its
neat
how
all
this
criticism
from
you
started
after
your
fatherly
admonitions
to
me
about
how
such
things
should
be
handled
outside
usenet
were
somewhat
rebuffed
being
a
little
hypocritical
tommy
to
go
with
the
immaturity
or
is
this
just
the
pique
of
a
netghod
wannabe
who
got
turned
down
by
someone
he
thought
was
new
and
hence
could
be
instructed
tommy
i
saw
you
come
on
the
net
who
cares
who
came
on
the
net
first
if
you
do
consider
that
you
saw
me
come
on
after
a
brief
haitus
before
which
i
was
on
for
about
years
if
you
had
seen
me
on
the
net
first
youd
remember
when
nick
and
i
went
down
exactly
the
same
road
regarding
rude
unneccesary
behavior
its
just
amazing
to
me
that
you
continue
to
take
issue
with
behavior
thats
no
worse
than
your
own
lets
see
here
my
complaints
about
your
obnoxious
behavior
are
hypocritical
while
your
flames
against
people
you
decide
are
flamers
isnt
and
my
complaints
about
your
namecalling
are
immature
while
your
namecalling
isnt
yeah
right
maybe
if
you
called
me
some
more
names
i
might
see
it
better
fred
netghod
wannabe
naturally
fred
youve
correctly
interpreted
my
motivations
when
yours
are
impossible
to
judge
from
your
actions
as
your
insulting
of
people
that
try
proves
i
didnt
really
care
about
people
that
fill
the
net
with
personal
garbage
what
i
really
wanted
was
to
impress
everyone
i
only
put
my
complaints
with
your
behavior
on
private
mail
not
because
it
belongs
there
but
because
i
thought
you
were
such
a
jerk
that
youd
bring
it
back
to
the
net
playing
right
into
my
hands
alas
i
had
no
idea
what
an
intellectual
master
you
were
turning
tables
and
bringing
the
history
of
these
posts
to
the
net
for
the
noble
and
valuable
purpose
of
embarassing
me
whether
i
should
feel
stupid
because
i
tried
to
make
suggestions
to
such
a
superior
intellect
or
becuase
i
tried
to
communicate
like
an
adult
with
a
selfrighteous
ass
still
isnt
clear
well
fred
you
exposed
me
now
ill
never

well
i

youre

leave

alone
now
i

i

quick
everyone
who
sees

a

that
says
hey
i
read

then
we
can
count

find

this

also
help
answer

the

jpl
is
actively
involved
in
the
study
of
ozone
and
the
atmosphere
in
three
important
ways
said
dr
jim
margitan
principal
investigator
on
the
balloon
research
campaign
there
are
two
jpl
instruments
on
the
uars
satellite
he
continued
the
atmos
experiment
is
conducted
by
jpl
scientists
and
the
jpl
balloon
research
provides
collaborative
ground
truth
for
those
activities
as
well
as
data
that
is
useful
in
its
own
right
the
measurements
taken
by
the
balloon
payload
will
add
more
pieces
to
the
complex
puzzle
of
the
atmosphere
specifically
the
midlatitude
stratosphere
during

spring
understanding
the
chemistry
occurring
in
this
region
helps
scientists
construct
more
accurate
computer
models
which
are
instrumental
in
predicting
future
ozone
conditions
the
scientific
balloon
payload
consisted
of
three
jpl
instruments
an
ultraviolet
ozone
photometer
which
measures
ozone
as
the
balloon
ascends
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
a
submillimeterwave
limb
sounder
which
looks
at
microwave
radiation
emitted
by
molecules
in
the
atmosphere
and
a
fourier

infrared
interferometer
which
monitors
how
the

absorbs

launch
occurred
at
about
noontime
and
following
a
three
hour
ascent
the
balloon
floated
eastward
at
approximately
kilometers
per

knots
data
was
radioed
to
ground
stations
and
recorded
onboard
the
flight
ended
at
pm
pacific
time
in
eastern
new
mexico
when
the
payload
was
commanded
to
separate
from
the
balloon
we
needed
to
fly
through
sunset
to
make
the
infrared
measurements
margitan
explained
and
we
also
needed
to
fly
in
darkness
to
watch
how
quickly
some
of
the
molecules
disappear
it
will
be
several
weeks
before
scientists
will
have
the
completed
results
of
their
experiments
they
will
then
forward
their

to
the
uars
central

at
the

the

from

is
to
keep

alive
for

and
fund
a

which
might
with

just
make

there
is

some

made

the

had
just
managed

the

the
ad
stated
that
theyd
sell
rockets
that
were
up
to
in
length
and
engines
of
sizes
f
to
m
they
also
said
that
some
rockets
will
reach
feet
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of
these
beasts
isnt
this
illegal
i
cant
imagine
the
faa
allowing
people
to
shoot
rockets
up
through
the
flight
levels
of
passenger
planes
the
situation
in
this
regard
has
changed
considerably
in
recent
years
see
the
discussion
of
highpower
rocketry
in
the
recmodelsrockets
frequentlyaskedquestions
list
this
is
not
hardware
you
can
walk
in
off
the
street
and
buy
you
need
proper
certification
that
can
be
had
mostly
through
tripoli
the
high
power
analog
of
the
nar
although
the
nar
is
cautiously
moving
to
extend
the
upper
boundaries
of
what
it
considers
proper
too
you
need
special
faa
authorization
but
provided
you
arent
doing
it
under
one
of
the
lax
runway
approaches
or
something
stupid
like
that
its
not
especially
hard
to
arrange
as
with
model
rocketry
this
sort
of
hardware
is
reasonably
safe
if
handled
properly
proper
handling
takes
more
care
and
you
need
a
lot
more
empty
air
to
fly
in
but
its
basically
just
model
rocketry
scaled
up
as
with
model
rocketry
the
highpower
people
use
factorybuilt
engines
which
eliminates
the
major
safety
hazard
of

re

lets
see
these
arent
in
a
strict
sense
amateur
rockets
that
term
denotes
rockets
the
engines
of
which
are
constructed
by
the
user
the
rockets
you
describe
are
called
hpr
or
high
power
rockets
to
distinguish
them
from
smaller
model
rockets
they
use
factorymade
ammonium
perchlorate
composite
propellants
in
phenolic
plastic
engines
with
graphite
nozzles
the
engines
are
classified
by
impulse
a
d
engine
for
example
can
have
no
more
than
newtonseconds
of
impulse
an
f
engine
can
have
no
more
than
ns
each
letter
corresponds
to
a
doubling
of
the
maximum
impulse
so
far
engines
up
to
size
o
are
available
pretty
much
off
the
shelf
engines
of
size
h
and
above
are
shipped
as

explosives

as
such
are

engines
of

f
and
below
are

this
happened

before

never
a

like
this
the
initial
investigation
into
the
incident
has
shown
that
a
thiokol
corp
technician
noticed
and
reported
his
pliers
as
missing
on
april
unfortunately
the
workers
supervisor
did
not
act
on
the
report
and
discovery
was
launched
with
its
extra

nasa

were
never
told
of
the
missing

before
the
april

the

were
supposed
to
be

when
the

was

in

its

apparently
inside

i

tonight
they
referred
to

the

also
said
that
a

missing

kind
during
assembly
of
one
srb
it
was
a
test
of

i
assume
then
that
someone
at
thiokol
put
on
their

hat
and
said
that
pissing
off
the
customer
by
delaying
shipment
of
the

to

inside
it
was
a
bad
idea
regardless

that

ended

why
do
i
get
the
feeling
that
thiokol

hats
are
shaped

pointy

they
can

so
they

eccentric
earth

doing

then
was
inserted
into

using
some
very
tricky
gravityassistlike
maneuvering
this
meant
that
it
would

on

eventually
since
there
is
no
such
thing
as

as
far
as
anyone
knows
and
i
believe
i
recall
hearing
recently
that
it
was
about
to
happen
the
gravity
maneuvering
that
was
used
was
to
exploit
fuzzy
regions
these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the
secondorder
perturbations
in
a
three
body
system
the
probe
was
launched
into
this
region
for
the
earthmoonsun
system
where
the
perturbations
affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural

sometimes
get

just
find

the
originator

said
that
nasa
wasnt

that
japan
was
because
their
probe
was
small
and
couldnt
hold
a

this
from
an

of

or

how
background
the
orion
spacedrive
was
a
theoretical
concept
it
would
be
a
drive
using
thermonuclear
explosions
to
drive
a

the
idea
was
that
youd
detonate
devices
with
somewhere
from
one
to
ten
megatons
yield
behind
a
pusher
plate
attached
to
the
main
spacecraft
the
shock
wave
from
the
explosions
would
transfer
momentum
to
the
ship
now
in
an
atmosphere
i
can
see
this
the
energy
of
the
explosion
heats
the
atmosphere
which
expands
explosively
and
slams
a
shock
wave
into
the
pusher
plate
but
in

only
two
things
i
can

are
going

oh
that

again
writes
the

maneuvering
that
was
used
was
to
exploit

these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the
secondorder

in
a
three

system
the

was
launched
into

for

the

affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural
objects
sometimes
get
captured
without
expending
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectory
that
makes
it
possible
the
originator
of
the
technique
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interested
but
that
japan
was
because
their

was

couldnt

there

for

so
it
means
that
you
just
can
not
put
a

around
around

for

because
its

will
be
unstable
if
so
what
is
the
reason
is
that
because
the
combined
gravitacional
atraction
of
the
sunmoon
and
earth
that
does
not
provide
a
stable
orbit
around
the

any
lunar
satellite
needs
fuel
to
do
regular
orbit
corrections
and
when
its

runs
out
it
will
crash
within

the
orbits
of
the

motherships
changed

it
is

there
the

is
poorly
mapped
but
we
know
of
none
perturbations
from

and
earth
are
relatively
minor
issues
at
low

the
big
problem
is
that
the
moons
own
gravitational

is
quite
lumpy
due
to
the
irregular

thiokol
provided
me
with
samples
and
data
on
a
reinforcement
to
solid
motor
grains
for
high
accelerations
solid
motor
propellants
usually
have
a
substantial
percentage
of
aluminum
in
the
mix
for
example
the
space
shuttle
srbs
are
percent
aluminum
the
technique
is
to
use
a
foamed
aluminum
structure
the
structure
looks
like
the
inverse
of
a
set
of
bubbles
an
i
suspect
some
bubbling
process
is
used
to
form
it
in
other
words
if
you
made
a
bunch
of
bubbles
in
molten
aluminum
then
froze
it
this
is
what
you
get
it
forms
a
strong
network
of
effectively
aluminum
wires
in
all
directions
the
remaining
solid
fuel
mix
is
infiltrated
into
the
voids
and
you
get
aluminumreinforced
solid
propellant
the
foamedaluminum
makes
up
about
percent
of
the
total
propellant
so
there
is
still
aluminum
particles
in
the
bulk
grain
the
major
improvement
is
the
higher
resistance
to
grain
cracking
which
is
the
principal
failure
mode
for
solid

re
guns
for
space
okay
lets
get
the
record
straight
on
the
livermore
gas
gun
the
project
manager
is
dr
john
hunter
and
he
works
for
the
laser
group
at
livermore
what
you
may
ask
does
gas
guns
have
to
do
with
lasers
nothing
really
but
the
gun
is
physically
located
across
the
road
from
the
free
electron
laser
building
and
the
fel
building
has
a
heavily
shielded
control
room
thick
walls
from
which
the
gun
firings
are
controlled
so
i
suspect
that
the
office
he
works
for
is
an
administrative
convenience
i
visited
hunter
at
the
beginning
of
feb
and
we
toured
the
gun
at
the
time
i
was
working
on
gas
gun
rd
at
boeing
where
i
work
but
i
am
now
doing
other
things
helping
to
save
the
space
station
the
gun
uses
a
methaneair
mixture
which
is
burned
in
a
chamber
about
ft
long
by
inch
id
ie
it
looks
like
a
pipe
the
chamber
holds
a
ton
piston
which
is
propelled
at
several
hundred
ms
down
the
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
piston
is
hudrogen
gas
initially
at
room
temperature
andsome
tens
of
atmospheres
the
piston
compresses
and
heats
the
hydrogen
ahead
of
it
until
a
stainless
steel
burst
diaphragm
ruptures
at
around
psi
the
barrel
of
the
gun
is
about
feet
long
and
has
a
inch
bore
it
is
mounted
at
right
angles
to
the
chamber
ie
they
intersect
this
was
done
so
that
in
the
future
the
barrel
could
be
raised
and
the
gun
fired
into
the
air
without
having
to
move
the
larger
and
heavier
chamber
the
projectile
being
used
in
testing
is
a
kg
cylinder
of
lexan
plastic
in
in
diameter
and
about
cm
long
all
of
the
acceleration
comes
from
the
expansion
of
the
hydrogen
gas
from
psi
downwards
until
the
projectile
leaves
the
barrel
the
barrel
is
evacuated
and
the
end
is
sealed
with
a
sheet
of
plastic
film
a
little
thicker
than
saran
wrap
the
plastic
is
blown
off
by
the
small
amount
of
residual
air
trapped
in
the
barrel
ahead
of
the
projectile
the
gun
is
fired
into
a
bunker
filled
with
sandbags
and
plastic
water
jugs
in
the
early
testing
fragments
of
the
plastic
projectile
were
found
at
the
higher
speeds
in
later
testing
the
projectile
vaporizes
the
testing
is
into
a
bunker
because
the
livermore
test
range
is
about
miles
across
and
the
projectile
would
go
km
if
fired
for
maximum
range
the
intent
is
to
move
the
whole
gun
to
vandenberg
afb
after
the
testing
is
complete
where
they
can
fire
into
the
pacific
ocean
and
use
the
tracking
radar
at
vafb
to
follow
the
projectiles
the
design
goal
of
the
gun
is
to
throw
a
kg
projectile
at
kms
half
of
orbital
speed
so
far
they
have
reached
kms
and
the
gun
is
currently
down
for
repairs
as
on
the
last
test
they
blew
a
seal
and
damaged
some
of
the
hardware
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
the
methaneair
more
detonating
than
burning
but
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
hunter
directly
on
this
there
are
people
waiting
to
test
scramjet
components
in
this
gun
by
firing
then
out
of
the
gun
into
the
air
at
mach
kms
since
the
most
you
can
get
in
wind
tunnels
is
mach
this
gun
cost
about
million
to
develop
and
is
basically
a
proofofconcept
for
a
bigger
gun
capable
of
firing
useful
sized
payloads
into
space
this
would
require
on
the
order
of
kg
projectiles
which
deliver
on
the
order
of
kg
useful
payload
to

let

this
gives
a

for

column
a

is
not

on
how
high
you
can

something
if
you

let
us
say
you
have
a

load
to
support
at

top
of
the

for
simplicity
in
calculation
this
requires
square
inches
of
column
cross
sectional
area
to
support
the
weight
the
mile
of
structure
below
the
payload
will
itself
weigh
lb
so
at

below
the
payload
the
total
load
is
now
lb
a
increase
the
next
mile
of
structure
must
be
thicker
in

to
support
the

plus
the

each
mile
of

must
increase
in

by
the

all
the
way
to
the

we
can
see
from
this
that
there
is
no
theoretical

on

although
there
will
be
practical

based
on
how

we

how

you

on

for

that
the

can
support
let
us
arbitrarily

with
this
we
can

perhaps
lb

this
is
clearly
above
the

a
rocket
launched
from
the
top
of
the
tower
will
still
have
to
provide
orbital
velocity
but
atmospheric
drag
and
glosses
will
be
almost
eliminated
glosses
are
the
component
of
rocket
thrust
in
the
vertical
direction
to
counter
gravity
but
which
do
not
contribute
to
horizontal
orbital
velocity
thus
they
represent
wasted
thrust
together
with
drag
rockets
starting
from
the
ground
have
a
velocity
penalty
to
contend
with
this
analysis
is
simplified
in
that
it
does
not
consider
wind
loads
these
will
require
more
structural
support
over
the
first
miles

its

these

the

is
a
matter
of

i
feel
sure
that
someday
we

more

unless
we

i

that

down
it
does
not
also
the

who
was

said
that
it
did
not
happen
there
either
and
that
this
figure
must
be

to
be
a
legitimate

how
do
i

i
write

have
won

and
i
know
to
the

what
the

are
at
uah
for

the

is
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their

rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our

did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in

if
you
have
some
numbers
allen
then
show
them
else
quit
barking
i
did
dennis
read
the
article
to
repeat
an
internal
estimate
done
by
the
reston
costing
department
says
freedom
can
be
built
for
about
a
year
and
operated
for
per
year
if
all
the
money
where
spent
on
freedom
since
we
spend
about
half
a
billion
more
per
year
it
looks
like
roughly
of
the
money
is
wasted
now
if
you
think
im
making
this
up
you
can
confirm
it
in
the
anonymous
editorial
published
a
few
weeks
ago
in

news
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an

of
the
overhead
capital
of

nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
this
dennis
is
why
nasa
has
so
many
problems
you
cant
accept
that
anything
is
wrong
unless
you
can
blame
it
on
congress
oh
sure
youll
say
nasa
has
problems
but
do
you
believe
it
remember
the
wp
overrun
you
insisted
it
was
all
congresses
fault
when
nasa
management
knew
about
the
overrun
for
almost
a
year
yet
refused
to
act
do
you
still
blame
congress
for
the
overrun
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
by
your
own
numbers
allen
at
a
cost
of
million
per
flight
the
service
cost
of
flying
shuttle
to
ssf
is
billion
for
four
flights
so
how
did
you
get
your
one
billion
number
i
have
no
idea
what
your
trying
to
say
here
dennis
allen
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a

if
the

gone
this

all

usually
called
a

much
of

involved
allocating

costing

the

where
universities

all
charged

as

of
the
work
down

is
one
of
the
nasa

centers
they
charge
a
fee
now
im
sure
your
a
competent
engineer
dennis
but
you
clearly
lack
experience
in
several
areas
your
posts
show
that
you
dont
understand
the
importance
of
integration
in
large
projects
you
also
show
a
lack
of
understanding
of
costing
efforts
as
shown
by
your
belief
that
it
is
reasonable
to
charge
incremental
costs
for
everything
this
isnt
a
flame
jsut
a
statement
your
employer
does
charge
a
fee
you
may
not
see
it
but
you
do
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their
overhead
rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our
president
did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in
the
overhead
well
there
you
are
dennis
as
i
said
they
simply
include
the
fee
in
their
overhead
many
seoparate
the
fee
since
the
fee
structure
can
change
depending
on
the
customer
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an
employee
of
the
overhead
capital
of
nasa
integration
dennis
isnt
overhead
nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
dennis
reston
has
been
the
only
nasa
agency
working
to
reduce
costs
when
wp
was
hemoraging
out
a
billion
the
centers
you
love
so
much
where
doing
their
best
to
cover
it
up
and
ignore
the
problem
reston
was
the
only
place
you
would
find
people
actually
interested
in
solving
the
problems
and
building
a
station
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
when
you
have
a
bit
more
experience
dennis
you
will
realize
that
integration
isnt
overhead
it
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
the
story
you
refer
to
said
that
some
nasa
people
blamed
it
on
congress
suprise
suprise
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
the
centers
you
support
so
much
who
covered
up
the
overheads
and
wouldnt
address
the
problems
until
the
press
published
the
story
are
you
saying
the
reston
managers
where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overruns
you
approve
of
what
the
centers
did
to
cover
up
the
overruns
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a
year
if
the
wrap
were
gone
this
merely
points
out
a
blatent
contridiction
in
your
numbers
that
understandably
you
fail
to
see
you
should
know
dennis
that
nasa
doesnt
include
transport
costs
for
resuply
that
comes
from
the
shuttle
budget
what
they
where
saying
is
that
operational
costs
could
be
cut
in
half

a

some
odd
posts

i
would
think
that
the
real

is
economic
since
someone

will
presumeably
have

they
would
without

eventually
they
will

if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific

commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a

why
not
approach
its
conceivable
that

its
possible
that
luna
will
have
a
commercial
purpose
but
its
most
likely
that
luna
will
only
have
a
scientific
purpose
for
the
next

hundred

therefore
lunar

should
be
predicated

purposes
not
only
does
this
provide
a
testbed
for

activities
but
it
also
provides
for
the
sharing
of

a

purposes
and
also
return

the
first

education

the
potential
of

a

purposes
by

we
not
only
create

also
a
method

the

that

it
can
actually
be
more
expensive
to
reach
a
satellite
from
another

from

with

it
will
be
cheaper
to
reach
more

remember
that
the

government
including

all
expected
a

usually
called
a

much
of
the
work
involved
allocating
and
costing
the
work
of
subcontractors
the
subcontractors
where
universities
forprofits
nonprofits
and
even
some
of

for

all
charged
fees
as
part
of
the
work
down
the
street
is
one
of
the
nasa
commercialization

they
charge
a
fee
you
totally
forgot
the
original
post
that
you
posted
allen
in
that
post
you
stated
that
the
wrap
was
on
top
of
and
in
addition
to
any
overhead
geez
in
this
post
you
finally
admit
that
this
is
not
true
now
im
sure
your
a
competent
engineer
dennis
but
you
clearly
lack
experience
in
several
areas
your
posts
show
that
you
dont
understand
the
importance
of
integration
in
large
projects
you
also
show
a
lack
of
understanding
of
costing
efforts
as
shown
by
your
belief
that
it
is
reasonable
to
charge
incremental
costs
for
everything
this
isnt
a
flame
jsut
a
statement
come
your
little
ol
buns
down
here
and
you
will
find
out
who
is
doing
what
and
who
is
working
on
integration
this
is
simply
an
ad
hominum
attack
and
you
know
it
your
employer
does
charge
a
fee
you
may
not
see
it
but
you
do
of
course
there
is
a
fee
it
is
for
administration
geez
allen
any
organization
has
costs
but
there
is
a
heck
of
a
difference
in
legitimate
costs
such
as
libraries
and
other
things
that
must
be
there
to
support
a
program
and
wrap
as
you
originally
stated
ityou
stated
that
wrap
was
on
top
of
all
of
the
overhead
which
a
couple
of
sentences
down
you
say
is
not
true
which
is
it
allen
sounds
like
they
are
adding
it
to
their
overhead
rate
go
ask
your
costing
people
how
much
fee
they
add
to
a
project
i
did
they
never
heard
of
it
but
suggest
that
like
our
president
did
that
any
percentage
number
like
this
is
included
in
the
overhead
well
there
you
are
dennis
as
i
said
they
simply
include
the
fee
in
their
overhead
many
seoparate
the
fee
since
the
fee
structure
can
change
depending
on
the
customer
as
you
have
posted
on
this
subject
allen
you
state
that
wrap
is
over
and
above
overhead
and
is
a
seperate
charge
you
admit
here
that
this
is
wrong
nasa
has
a
line
item
budget
every
year
i
have
seen
it
allen
get
some
numbers
from
that
detailed
nasa
budget
and
dig
out
the
wrap
numbers
and
then
howl
to
high
heaven
about
it
until
you
do
that
you
are
barking
in
the
wind
no
allen
you
did
not
you
merely
repeated
allegations
made
by
an
employee
of
the
overhead
capital
of
nasa
integration
dennis
isnt
overhead
nothing
that
reston
does
could
not
be
dont
better
or
cheaper
at
the
other
nasa
centers
where
the
work
is
going
on
integration
could
be
done
better
at
the
centers
apollo
integration
was
done
here
at
msfc
and
that
did
not
turn
out
so
bad
the
philosophy
of
reston
is
totally
wrong
allen
there
you
have
a
bunch
of
people
who
are
completely
removed
from
the
work
that
they
are
trying
to
oversee
there
is
no
way
that
will
ever
work
it
has
never
worked
in
any
large
scale
project
that
it
was
ever
tried
on
could
you
imagine
a
reston
like
set
up
for
apollo
dennis
reston
has
been
the
only
nasa
agency
working
to
reduce
costs
when
wp
was
hemoraging
out
a
billion
the
centers
you
love
so
much
where
doing
their
best
to
cover
it
up
and
ignore
the
problem
reston
was
the
only
place
you
would
find
people
actually
interested
in
solving
the
problems
and
building
a
station
oh
you
are
full
of
it
allen
on
this
one
i
agree
that
jsc
screwed
up
big
they
should
be
responsible
for
that
screw
up
and
the
people
that
caused
it
replaced
to
make
a
stupid
statement
like
that
just
shows
how
deep
your
bias
goes
come
to
msfc
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
you
will
find
out
just
how
wrong
you
really
are
maybe
not
people
like
you
believe
exactly
what
they
want
to
believe
no
matter
what
the
facts
are
contrary
to
it
kinda
funny
isnt
it
that
someone
who
talks
about
a
problem
like
this
is
at
a
place
where
everything
is
overhead
when
you
have
a
bit
more
experience
dennis
you
will
realize
that
integration
isnt
overhead
it
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
i
agree
that
integration
is
the
single
most
important
part
of
a
successful
large
scale
effort
what
i
completly
disagree
with
is
seperating
that
integration
function
from
the
people
that
are
doing
the
work
it
is
called
leadership
allen
that
is
what
made
apollo
work
final
responsibility
for
the
success
of
apollo
was
held
by
less
than
people
that
is
leadership
and
responsibility
there
is
neither
when
you
have
any
organization
set
up
as
reston
is
you
could
take
the
same
people
and
move
them
to
jsc
or
msfc
and
they
could
do
a
much
better
job
why
did
it
take
a
year
for
reston
to
finally
say
something
about
the
problem
if
they
were
on
site
and
part
of
the
process
then
the
problem
would
have
never
gotten
out
of
hand
in
the
first
place
there
is
one
heck
of
a
lot
i
do
not
know
allen
but
one
thing
i
do
know
is
that
for
a
project
to
be
successful
you
must
have
leadership
i
remember
all
of
the
turn
over
at
reston
that
kept
ssf
program
in
shambles
for
years
do
you
it
is
lack
of
responsibility
and
leadership
that
is
the
programs
problem
lack
of
leadership
from
the
white
house
congress
and
at
reston
nasa
is
only
a
symptom
of
a
greater
national
problem
you
are
so
narrowly
focused
in
your
efforts
that
you
do
not
see
this
why
did
the
space
news
artice
point
out
that
it
was
the
congressionally
demanded
change
that
caused
the
problems
methinks
that
you
are
being
selective
with
the
facts
again
the
story
you
refer
to
said
that
some
nasa
people
blamed
it
on
congress
suprise
suprise
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
the
centers
you
support
so
much
who
covered
up
the
overheads
and
wouldnt
address
the
problems
until
the
press
published
the
story
are
you
saying
the
reston
managers
where
wrong
to
get
nasa
to
address
the
overruns
you
approve
of
what
the
centers
did
to
cover
up
the
overruns
no
i
am
saying
that
if
they
were
located
at
jsc
it
never
would
have
happened
in
the
first
place
if
it
takes
four
flights
a
year
to
resupply
the
station
and
you
have
a
cost
of
million
a
flight
then
you
pay
billion
a
year
you
stated
that
your
friend
at
reston
said
that
with
the
current
station
they
could
resupply
it
for
a
billion
a
year
if
the
wrap
were
gone
this
merely
points
out
a
blatent
contridiction
in
your
numbers
that
understandably
you
fail
to
see
you
should
know
dennis
that
nasa
doesnt
include
transport
costs
for
resuply
that
comes
from
the
shuttle
budget
what
they
where
saying
is
that
operational
costs
could
be
cut
in
half
plus
transport
sorry
gang
but
i
have
a
deadline
for
a
satellite
so
someone
else
is
going
to
have
to
do
allens
math
for
him
for
a
while
i
will
have
little
chance
to
do
so
i
do
hope
you
can
find
the
time
to
tell
us
just
why
it
was
wrong
of
reston
to
ask
that
the
problems
with
wp
be
addressed
i
have
the
time
to
reitereate
one
more
timet
that
if
the
leadership
that
is
at
reston
was
on
site
at
jsc
the
problem
never
would
have
happened
totally
ignoring
the
lack
of
leadership
of
congress
this
many
headed
hydra
that
has
grown
up
at
nasa
is
the
true
problem
of
the
agency
and
to
try
to
change
the
question
to
suit
you
and
your

is

this

whats
a

good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific
or
commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
why
not
approach
ah
but
the
whole
point
is
that
money
spent
on
a
lunar
base
is
not
wasted
on
the
moon
its
not
like
theyd
be
using
bills
to
fuel
their
moondozers
the
money
to
fund
a
lunar
base
would
be
spent
in
the
country
to
which
the
base
belonged
its
a
way
of
funding
hightech
research
just
like
darpa
was
a
good
excuse
to
fund
various
fields
of
research
under
the
pretense
that
it
was
crucial
to
the
defense
of
the
country
or
like
esprit
is
a
good
excuse
for
the
ec
to
fund
research
under
the
pretense
that
its
good
for
paneuropean
cooperation
now
maybe
you
think
that
governmentfunded
research
is
a
waste
of
money
in
fact
im
pretty
sure
you
do
but
it
does
count
as
investment
spending
which
does
boost
the
economy
and
just
look
at
the
size
of
that
multiplier

my

things

have
the

because
they
arent

fix

they
just
tell

ignore

make
the

big

our

payload
with

and
a

weighs

it
uses
freon

ie
during
our
eight
minutes
in

the
jets
are
pretty
much
continuously
firing
on

or
so
the
jets
also
need
to
kill

and
flip
the

around
to

we
have

holding

they
have

should

this
is

whats
a

good
for
and
i
ought
not
to
post
when
ive
a
hundred
some
odd
posts
to
go
but
i
would
think
that
the
real
reason
to
have
a
moon
base
is
economic
since
someone
with
space
industry
will
presumeably
have
a
much
larger
gnp
than
they
would
without
space
industry
eventually
they
will
simply
be
able
to
afford
more
stuff
if
i
read
you
right
youre
saying
in
essence
that
with
a
larger
economy
nations
will
have
more
discretionary
funds
to
waste
on
a
lunar
facility
that
was
certainly
partially
the
case
with
apollo
but
real
lunar
colonies
will
probably
require
a
continuing
military
scientific
or
commercial
reason
for
being
rather
than
just
a
we
have
the
money
why
not
approach
i
was
assuming
that
there
wont
be
a
moon
base
unless
it
makes
a
profit
actually
if
it
does
well
that
gives
a
larger
gnp
which
leads
to
being
able
to
spend
more
money
on
your
military
including
goshwow
space
stuff
assuming
its
profitable
rather
than
paying
for
itself
its
conceivable
that
luna
will
have
a
military
purpose
its
possible
that
luna
will
have
a
commercial
purpose
but
its
most
likely
that
luna
will
only
have
a
scientific
purpose
for
the
next
several
hundred
years
at
least
therefore
lunar
bases
should
be
predicated
on
funding
levels
little
different
from
those
found
for
antarctic
bases
can
you
put
a
person
base
on
the
moon
for
million
a
year
even
if
you
use
grad
students
you
might
be
able

run
one

that
put
it
there

you

i
am
looking
for
any
information
concerning
projects
involving
solar
sails
i
was
at
an
interesting
seminar
at
work
uks
ral
space
science
dept
on
this
subject
specifically
on
a
smallscale
solar
sail
proposed
as
a
student
space
project
the
guy
giving
the
talk
was
keen
to
generate
interest
in
the
project
ill
typein
the
handout
he
gave
out
at
the
meeting
here
goes
the
microlight
solar
sail
introduction
the
solar
sail
is
a
wellestablished
concept
harnessing
the
pressure
of
sunlight
a
spacecraft
would
have
unlimited
range
in
principle
such
a
vehicle
could
explore
the
whole
solar
system
with
zero
fuel
consumption
however
it
is
more
difficult
to
design
a
practical
solar
sail
than
most
people
realize
the
pressure
of
sunlight
is
only
about
one
kilogram
per
square
kilometer
deploying
and
controlling
the
large
area
of
aluminized
fabric
which
would
be
necessary
to
transport
a
conventional
type
spacecraft
is
a
daunting
task
this
is
why
despite
the
potential
of
hte
idea
no
such
craft
has
actually
been
launched
to
date
recent
advances
in
microelectronics
make
possible
a
different
concept
a
tiny
sail
just
a
few
metres
in
diameter
which
could
be
controlled
purely
be
electronics
with
no
mechanical
parts
several
attitude
control
methods
are
feasible
for
example
the
pressure
sunlight
exerts
on
a
panel
of
solar
cells
varies
according
to
whether
power
is
being
drawn
the
key
components
of
the
craft
will
be
a
minute
ccd
camera
developed
at
edinburgh
university
which
can
act
as
both
attitude
sensor
and
data
gathering
device
solar
cells
providing
watt
power
for
control
and
communication
and
a
directional
radio
antenna
etched
onto
the
surface
of
the
sail
itself
launched
as
a
piggyback
payload
the
total
cost
of
the
mission
can
be
limited
to
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
the
craft
would
be
capable
of
some
ambitious
missions
for
example
a
it
could
rendezvous
with
a
nearby
asteroid
from
the
apollo
or
amor
groups
closeup
pictures
could
be
transmitted
back
to
earth
at
a
low
bit
rate
b
it
could
be
steered
into
a
lunar
polar
orbit
previously
unobserved
areas
around
the
lunar
poles
could
be
viewed
by
angling
the
sail
to
reflect
sunlight
downwards
polar
craters
whose
bases
never
receive
sunlight
could
be
imaged
bright
reflections
would
confirm
that
volatiles
such
as
water
ice
have
become
trapped
in
these
locationsimmensely
valuable
information
for
setting
up
a
manned
lunar
base
btw
c
it
could
be
sent
to
rendezvous
with
a
small
asteroid
or
comet
nucleus
impacting
at
low
speed
a
thin
wire
probe
attached
to
the
craft
causes
it
to
rebound
while
capturing
a
tiny
sample
is
a
sharpedged
tube
like
performing
a
biopsy
returning
to
earth
the
sail
acts
as
an
ideal
reentry
parachute
load
per
unit
area
ensures
that
heat
is
reradiated
so
efectively
that
the
sail
temperature
cannot
exceed
deg
c
the
material
sample
is

that

for

therefore
lunar

commerical

wishful
thinking
mostly
its
more
likely
that
the

will
never
be
the
site
of
major
commercial
activity
as
far
as
we
know
it
has
no
materials
we
cant
get
cheaper
right
here
on
earth
or
from
asteroids
and
comets
aside
from
the
semimythic
that
might
be
useful
in
low
grade
fusion
reactors
exploring
it
would
satisfy
a
curiosity
itch
and
its
position
in
the
gravity
well
of
earth
coupled
with
its
heat
sink
capacity
could
offer
some
military
utility
for
high
ground
military
weapons
systems
but
it
holds
very
minute
commercial
value
if
space
travel
becomes
cheap
enough
it
might
become
a
tourist
attraction
as
mt
everest
and
the
antarctic
have
become
but
thats
a
very
minor
activity
in
the
global
scope
of
things
luna
has
an
inconvienent
gravity
field
its
likely
too
low
to
prevent
calcium
loss
muscle
atrophy
and
long
term
genetic
drift
yet
its
too
high
to
do
microg
manufacturing
space
based
colonies
and
factories
that
can
be
spun
to
any
convienent
value
of
g
look
much
better
luna
has
a
modest
vacuum
and
raw
solar
exposure
two
weeks
a
month
but
orbital
sites
can
have
better
vacuums
and
continous
solar
exposure
luna
offers
a
source
of
light
element
rocks
that
can
serve
as
raw
materials
heatsink
and
shielding
the
asteroids
and
comets
offer
sources
of
both
light
and
heavy
elements
and
volatile
compounds
and
many
are
in
less
steep
gravity
wells
so
that
less
deltav
is
required
to
reach
them
we
dont
use
of
the
earth
now
the
seafloors
and
we
virtually
ignore
antarctica
a
whole
continent
thats
because
we
dont
have
to
deal
with
those
conditions
in
order
to
make
a

luna
is
a
much
more
expensive
place

back
at

a

lunas
main
short

would
be
as
a

for
a

radio
astronomy
observatory
shielded
from

as
the

or
linear
accelerator
weapons
system
for
defending
earth
or
bombarding
it
as
the
case
may
be
the
first
is
unlikely
because
of
the
high
cost
for
such
a
basic
science
instrument
the
second
is
just
as
unlikely
because
conventional
nukes
are
good
enough
and
the

would
really
rather
see
the

that

its
not

the

maybe
you

it

count

theres
not
a

of
this
in

it
may
be
that
they
just
didnt
mention
it
or
that
they
actually
havent
thought
about
it
i
got
the
vague
impression
from
their
mission
proposal
that
they
werent
taking
a
very
holistic
aproach
to
the
whole
thing
they
seemed
to
want
to
land
people
on

by

end
of

without
explaining

or

they
would

they

keeping

on
after

cuts
why
do
spacecraft
have
to
be
shut
off
after
funding
cuts
for
example
why
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bobbing
about
venus
in
a
lowpoweruse
mode
and
if
maybe
in
a
few
years
if
funding
gets
restored
after
the
economy
gets
better
hopefully
it
could
be
turned
on
again
for
that
matter
why
exactly
were
the
apollo
lunar
experiments
turned
off
rather
than
just
safed
was
it
political
ie
as
along
as
they
could
be
used
someone
would
keep
bugging
congress
for
funds
turning
them
off
keeps
them
pesky
scientists
out
of
the
bureaucrats
hair
ive
heard
the
argument
that
an
active
but
uncontrolled
spacecraft
causes
radio
noise
i
find
that
hard
to
believe
that
this
could
be
a
problem
in
a
properly
designed
safe
mode
this
safe
mode
could
be
a
program
routine
which
causes
the
spacecraft
to
go
to
least
fuel
using
orientation
and
once
a
week
month
year
whatever
attempts
a
signal
lock
on
earth
at
that
time
if
funding
has
been
restored
the
mission
can
continue
if
no
signal
is
recieved
the
spacecraft
goes
back
to
the
safe
mode
for
another
time
period
as
we
would
know
when
the
spacecraft
is
going
to
try
to
contact
earth
we
could
be
prepared
if
necessary
as
another
a
spacecraft
could
do
at
the
attempted
contact
is
beam
stored
data
towards
earth
if
someone
can
receive
it
great
if
not
so
its
lost
and
no
big
deal
by
making
the
time
and
signal
location
generally
known
perhaps
someone
in
the
world
might
be
able
and
willing
to
intercept
the
data
even
if
theyre
not
willing
to
contact
the
spacecraft
i
see
this
as
being
particularly
useful
for
spacecraft
which
could
have
an
otherwise
long
life
and
are
in
or
are
going
to
places
which
are
otherwise
unaccessible
jupitersaturn
orbit
exiting
the
solar
system
etc
perhaps
those
designing
future
spacecraft
cassini
pluto
flyby
etc
should
consider
designing
in
a
pause
mode
in
case
their
spacecraft
gets
the
ax
sometime
in
the
future
after
completion
of
the
primary
mission
perhaps
mars
observer
and
galilleo
could
have
some
kind
of
routine
written
in
for
the
post

drift
phase
so
any
holes
in
all
this

i
dont

what
a
low

fusion
reactor
is
but
the
major
problem
with
aside
from
the
difficulty
in
making
any
fusion
reactor
work
is
that
its
concentration
in
lunar
regolith
is
just
so
small
on
the
order
of
ppb
or
so
on
average
more
in
some
fractions
but
still
very
small
massive
amounts
of
regolith
would
have
to
be
processed
this
thread
reminds
me
of
wingos
claims
some
time
ago
about
the
moon
as
a
source
of
titanium
for
use
on
earth
as
i
recall
wingo
wasnt
content
with
being
assured
that
titanium
at
in
the
earths
crust
average
would
not
run
out
and
touted
lunar
mines
even
though
the
market
price
of
ilmenite
concentrate
these
days
is
around
this
prompted
me
to
look
up
large
potential
terrestrial
sources
on
the
moon
titanium
occurs
in
basalts
highti
basalts
apollo
and
have
titanium
dioxide
by
weight
this
is
nice
but
terrestrial
continental
flood
basalts
are
also
typically
enriched
in
titanium
they
very
often
have
frequently
have
and
sometimes
even
again
by
weight
these
flood
basalts
are
enormous
millions
of
cubic
kilometers
scattered
all
over
the
world
siberia
brazil
the
nw
united
states
ethiopia
etc
if
even
of
the
basalts
are
this
is
trillions
of
tons
of
at
concentrations
only
a
factor
of
less
than
in
lunar
highti
basalts
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
disadvantages
of
the
moon
could
be
overcome
by
such
a
small
increase
the
concentration
of
the
ore
never
mind
the

less
common
terrestrial

also

in

rather
through

attack
on
the

during
the

standdown
they
simply
threw
hundreds
of
people
at
it
and
did
the
whole

by

i
think
this
is
a
little
inaccurate
based
on
feynmans
account
of
the
softwaredevelopment
process
before
the

fred
is
basically
correct
no
sophisticated

just
a

of
effort
and
painstaking
care
but
they
got
this
one
right
before
challenger
feynman
cited
the

as

compared
to
the

he
also
noted
that
the

were
starting
to
feel
management
pressure
to
cut
corners
but
hadnt
had
to
give
in
to
it
much
yet
among
other
things
the
software
people
worked
very
hard
to
get
things
right
for
the
major
preflight
simulations
and
considered
a
failure
during
those
simulations
to
be
nearly
as
bad
as
an
inflight
failure
as
a
result
the
number
of
majorsimulation
failures
could
be
counted
on
one
hand
and
the
number
of
inflight
failures
was
zero
as
fred
mentioned
elsewhere
this
applies
only
to
the
flight
software
software
that
runs
experiments
is
typically
mostly
put
together
by
the

and
gets
nowhere

i
question
whether

id

its
around

and
the
total

delivered
was
about

so
if
you
ignore
the
scientific

hitch
a
ride
in
the

habitation
module
no
return
trip
and
toss
in
a
few
more
tonnes
for
the
additional

to
last
another

then
you
might
be

to
get
a

visit
out
of
tonnes
and
in
case
its
not
obvious
thats
a
wild
ass
guess
a

boring
visit
since
every

outdoors
eats
up
a

and
im
not

if
a

lets
round
this
up

about

on

recalled
it
discussed
things
like
how
much
heat
the

produced
how

lunar
material
itd
need
for
protection
from
solar

etc

jay
and
again
please
try
to
encourage
anyone
that
can
observe
the
iapetus
planet
disappearance
to
do
so
at
thermal
wavelengths
my
impression
would
be
that
its
not
an
easy
observation
iapetus
will
be
faint
and
getting
fainter
in
eclipse
so
youll
need
a
big
telescope
thats
a
good
ir
telescope
and
reasonable
um
instrumentation
i
dont
think
that
combination
is
widely
available
at
the
longitudes
that
are
well
placed

we

if

hopefully
it

it
can
be

the
problem
is
a
political
one
not

technical
one
also
remember
that
every
dollar
spent
keeping

in

probably
a
spinstabilized

orientation
is
a
dollar
not
spent
on
mission
analysis
for
a
newer
spacecraft
in
order
to
turn
the
spacecraft
back
on
you
either
need
to
insure
that
the
ops
guys
will
be
available
or
you
need
to
retrain
a
new
team
having
said
that
there
are
some
spacecraft
that
do
what
you
have
proposed
many
of
the
operational
satellites
goddard
flies
like
the
tiros
noaa
series
require
more
than
one
satellite
in
orbit
for
an
operational
set
extras
which
get
replaced
onorbit
are
powered
into
a
standby
mode
for
use
in
an
emergency
in
that
case
however
the
same
ops
team
is
still
required
to
fly
the
operational
birds
so
the
standby
maintenance
is
relatively
cheap
finally
pats
explanation
some
spacecraft
require
continuous
maintenance
to
stay
under
control
is
also
right
on
the
mark
i
suggested
a
spin
stabilized
control
mode
because
it
would
require
little
power
or
maintenance
but
it
still
might
require
some
momentum
dumping
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
it
is
a
political
decision
since
the
difference
is
money
but
there
is
some
technical
rationale
behind
the

i

the

this

was

i
recently
read
that
the

nothing

if

they

the

the

to

as
the
is
designed
for
the
extremely
harsh
envorinment
of

it
is
also
closer
to
m
in

youve
hit
on
the
real
kicker
however
the
centaur
is
pressure
stabilized
it
cannot
hold
up
its
own
weight
without
pressure
in
the
tanks
additionally
the
pressure
difference
between
the
two
tanks
must
be
maintained
to
psi
that
is
rather
tight
to
be
rocking
and
rolling
on
the
train
the
pressure
stabilization
is
how
centaur
achieves
the
performance
on
numerous
occasions
when
i
was
there
the
af
wanted
to
see
what
it
would
take
to
make
a
nonpressure
stabilized
centaur
the
answer
a
centaur
not
worth
launching
the
atlascentaur
does
not
require
onpad
integration
however
the
does
i
believe
the
onpad
integration
is
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
cleanliness
requirements
and
pfl
configuration
so
maybe
something
can
be
done
there
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facilities
added

you

the
addition
of
loxlh
facilities
is
critical
as
the
centaur
tops
off
as
it
lifts
off
a
lhe
facility
is
also
needed
i
dont
know
what
the
proton
uses
for
fuel
but
since
they
are
derived
from
icbms
i
would
suspect
that
they
use
storable
propellants
which
dont
have
the
ullage
problem
that

do
if
there
is

at

still
some

even
if

let

it

be
a

if

it

mike

is
that
the

so
all

the

and
a

it
had
a

and
the

distance
from

was
about
the

all

much
more

the
commercial

are
obvious
spaceflight
is
not
in
this
position
the
correct
analogy
is
not
with
aviation
of
the
but
the
long
transocean
voyages
of
the
age
of
discovery
lindberghs
flight
took
place
in
not
the
thirties
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
could
you
give
examples
of
privately
funded
ones
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
your
logic
certainly
applies
to
standard
investment
strategies
however
the
concept
of
a
prize
for
a
difficult
goal
is
done
for
different
reasons
i
suspect
im
not
aware
that
mr
orteig
received
any
significant
economic
benefit
from
lindberghs
flight
modern
analogies
such
as
the
prize
for
a
human
powered
helicopter
face
similar
arguments
there
is
little
economic
benefit
in
such
a
thing
the
advantage
comes
in
the
new
approaches
developed
and
the
fact
that
a
prize
will
frequently
generate
far
more
work
than
the
equivalent
amount
of
direct
investment
would
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it

surviving

hi
i
was
reading
through
the
spaceflight
handbook
and
somewhere
in
there
the
author
discusses
solar
sails
and
the
forces
acting
on
them
when
and
if
they
try
to
gain
an
initial
acceleration
by
passing
close
to
the
sun
in
a
hyperbolic
orbit
the
magnitude
of
such
accelerations
he
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
he
also
says
that
this
is
may
not
be
a
big
problem
for
manned
craft
because
humans
and
this
was
published
in
have
already
withstood
accelerations
of
all
this
is
very
longwinded
but
heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
can
this
be

basically
get

to
make

so
hard

on

you
think
this
is
crazy
well
in

way
it
is
but
in
a
way
it
is
reality
there
is
a
billin
the
congress
to
do
just
that
basically
to
make
it
so
expensive
to
mine
minerals
in
the
us
unless
you
can
by
off
the
inspectors
or
tax
collectors
ascially
what
i
understand
from
talking
to
a
few
miner
friends
of
mine
that
they
the
congress
propose
to
have
a
tax
on
the
gross
income
of
the
mine
versus
the
adjusted
income
also
the
state
governments
have
there
normal
taxes
so
by
the
time
you
get
done
paying
for
materials
workers
and
other
expenses
you
can
owe
more
than
what
you
made
basically
if
you
make
a
and
spend
ofor
expenses
you
can
owe
in
federal
taxes
bascially
it
is
driving
the
miners
off
the
land
and
the
only
peopel
who
benefit
are
the
ecofreaks
basically
to
get
back
to
my
beginning
statement
is
space
is
the
way
to
go
cause
it
might
just
get
to
expensive
to
mine
on
earth
because
of
either
the

or

most
successful

you
told
us
in
the

a
new
form
of
launch
vehicle
a
single

reusable
rocket
can
and
should
be
built
you
advocated
this
idea
tirelessly
it
was
elegantly
simple
as
are
all
great
breakthroughs
you
showed
us
how
to
build
it
you
convinced
us
it
could
be
done
you
are
working
by
our
side
to
weld
its
components
into
place
most
important
you
reminded
us
of
a
prime
engineering
principle
undoubtably
one
you
learned
from
the
generation
before
you
the
generation
that
built
transcontinental
aviation
in
the
and
build
a
little
and
test
a
little
and
max
you
passed
all
of
this
on
to
people
like

started

didnt

built

tested
a
little
even
sold
a
little

made
a
little
money
before
they
moved
on
to
the
next
step
they
didnt
take
a
decade
or
more
before
putting
the
first
rubber
on
the
road
max
hunter
you
didnt
take
ten
years
to
build
thor
and
by
god
were
not
going
to
take
ten
years
to
show
that
low
cost
single
stage
reusable
aerospace
transportation
is
real
we
ended
the
cold
war
in
a
few
short
years
it
took
the
same
team
here
today
but
a
few
years
to
show
through
the
strategic
defense
initiative
that
the
cold
war
must
end
we
you
and
us
launched
a
series
of
satellites
the
delta
experiments
in
about
a
year
apiece
this
more
than
anything
else
signaled
our
commitment
to
end
the
impasse
between
ourselves
and
the
soviet
union
those
who
made
the
decisions
on
both
sides
have
underscored
the
importance
of
our
work
in
bringing
about
a
new
international
relationship
but
it
is
the
same
team
which
is
now
putting
in
place
the
framework
for
an
aerospace
expansion
that
is
our
legacy
for
the
next
generation
we
will
make
space
access
routine
and
affordable
we
built
this
magnificent
flying
machine
in
two
years
this
summer
a
true
rocket
ship
will
take
off
and
land
on
earth
for
the
first
time
then
we
can
and
surely
will
build
in
the
next
three
years
a
reusable
suborbital
rocket
it
will
allow
us
to
use
space
rapidly
affordably
and
efficiently
as
no
other
nation
can
and
yes
well
make
a
little
money
off
it
too
then
and
only
then
well
spend
another
three
years
to
build
a
fully
reusable
single
stage
to
orbit
system
the
of
space
will
be
a
reality
we
may
even
be
able
to
use
some
of
the
rocket
propulsion
breakthroughs
of
our
former
cold
war
adversaries
what
a

if
this

product
and
russian

to
counter

like
to

rocket
technology
rocket
or
ssrt
by
i
intend
to
speak
of
more
how
to
lower
the
cost
and
make

ssrt
is
to
my
mind
and
i
hope
to
convince
you
the
erupting
a
new
rallying
cry
for
our
generation
in
space
faster
cheaper
and
better
faster
cheaper
better
and
ssrt
represent
the
passing
of
a
torch
from
one
technical
generation
to
another
it
is
a
new
thing
to
be
sure
but
it
is
also
a
relearning
of
old
things
from
past
masters
when
we
rolled
out
the
ssrt
baby
two
weeks
ago
so
called
experts
told
us
it
violates
the
laws
of
physics
it
made
no
sense
for
example
dr
eberhart
rachtin
former
president
of
the
aerospace
corp
said
of
ssrt
in
the
la
times
that
it
defies
the
best
principles
of
launching
payloads
into
space
well
dr
rachtin
youve
made
us
mad
what
are
these
principles
that
ssrt
defies
well
ill
tell
you
it
violates
the
principle
that
you
need
a
giant
program
office
to
build
space
hardware
it
violates
the
fact
that
it
takes
years
to
build
something
new
and
it
violates
the
truism
that
you
cant
do
anything
significant
for
less
than
many
billions
of
dollars
it
took
some
of
the
last
generations
experts
to
teach
us
some
newold
lessons
werhner
von
brauns
first
rocket
was
not
a
saturn
v
general
schrievers
icbms
didnt
take
ten
years
to
demonstrate
and
the
airplane
didnt
cost
billion
it
took
one
of
the
great
engineers
of
the
to
remind
us
of
these
truths
max
hunter
max
to
remind
you
was
a
senior

in

program
and
old
faster
better
cheaper
success
story
max
has
been
persistent
in
a
vision
of
a
single
stage
reusable
space
launch
system
since
the
because
he
knew
it
had
to
be
done
in
affordable
steps
build
a
little
test
a
little
next
he
persuaded
us
to
do
a
technology
demonstration
we
didnt
solicit
a
bunch
of
requirements
theyd
just
change
every
few
years
anyway
not
included
in
the
speech
the
alsnls
has
such
ephemeral
requirements
that
it
would
better
known
as
shape
shifter
than
space
lifter
we
didnt
spend
a
lot
money
this
xrocket
only
cost
million
whens
the
last
time
we
even
built
a
new
airplane
for
that
and
it
didnt
take
a
lot
of
time
to
build
mcdonnell
douglas
completed
it
in
months
finally
the
government
program
office
consisted
of
one
very
overworked
air
force
major
motivated
in
part
by
the
threat
that
hed
get
to
ride
on
it
in
a
strappedon
lawn
chair
if
it
ran
over
cost
or
schedule
as
i
described
what
ssrt
is
and
isnt
keep
in
mind
its
only
a
first
step
there
are
several
more
steps
and
steps
that
can
easily
fail
before
the
us
can
field
an
ssto
but
each
step
should
follow
the
same
principles
a
small
management
team
a
few
years
technology
demonstration
and
a
modest
budget
let
me
show
a
few
details
on
ssrt
and
how
it
might
evolve
see
charts
im
embarrassed
when
my
generation
is
compared
with
the
last
generation
the
giants
of
the
last
great
space
era
the
and
they
went
to
the
moon
we
built
a
telescope
that
cant
see
straight
they
softlanded
on
mars
the
least
we
could
do
is
softland
on
earth
but
we
do
have
an
answer
we
can
follow
their
build
a
little
test
a
little
philosophy
to
produce
a
truly
affordable
and
routine
access
to
space
i
know
there
are
nay
sayers
among
you
those
who
say
ssrt
is
a
stunt
it
needs
more
thermal
protection
the
engines
are
wrong
it
would
be
better
to
land
horizontally
etc
etc
i
say
to
you
well
see
you

in

you
bring

and
ill

we

we
can

you

moon

are
about

its

that
the

the

is
not

the

lattice
in

is
like
sticking

giving

the

lattice
has
so

its

got
the
whole

wound
up
the
piece

going

can
slide
down
the
spaghetti
and
maybe
make
a

hook
at
the
end
the
piece

going

has
to
go
around
the
whole

like

before

with

draw

at

totally
eclipse

look

except
for

would
you

no

lightyears

is

what

happening

the

may
have
experienced
many

but
the

could
be
very
quick
our

i
might

despin
myself
phase
out
my

good

trying

design
a

to

its

studying

id
look
in
the

of

or
holy

brain

just
might

id
start
looking

due

all
the

noise
billion
humans
id
totally
isolate
myself
record
me
thinking
dog
backwards
and
learn
to
read
what
i
got
microsoft
holy
grail
card
for
pentium
next
concluding
that
my
thoughts
were
recorded
on
a
non
timebound
media
the
ether
and
that
it
is
i
who
move
forward
in
time
i
would
try
to
temporarily
locally
reverse
the
flow
of
time
which
id
start
looking
for
as
flowing
opposite
magnetism
pole
to
pole
why
not
perhaps
by
passing
a
large
flat
dc
current
through
a
two
foot
diameter
coil
or
choke
or
something
and
seeing
what
i
could
get
with
my
machines
receiver
next
to
it
if
you
dont
think
youll
live
to
see
it
consider
this
quit
putting
the
reproductive
keys
of
other
life
in
your
body
all
of
lifes
data
could
be
written
on
the
wind
ether
not
just
our
thoughts
dna
could
be
a
little
receiver
or
file
access
code
by
eating
seeds
we
could
be
jamming
our
reception
or
receiving
plant
instructions
try
eating
seed
bearing
fruit
maybe
those
greek
or
biblical
guys
did
live
hundreds
of
years
im
curios
to
see
what
they
did
and
ate
dont
worry
if
your
hair
stops
growing
maybe
we
dont
need
to
eat
at
all
the
cosmos
are
formed
from
nothing
and
that
is
creating
matter
i
only
need
enough
to
bounce
around
where
did
the
household
concept
immortal
come
from
wheat
is
a
weed
it
is
programmed
to
pull
from
the
soil
reproduce
like
hell
and
then
die
warning
about
writing
to
the
past
i
had
a
little
dream
of
being
in
a
world
in
the
near
parallel
future
lying
along
a
path
of
history
which
we
have
diverged
from
there
were
twelve
telepathic
glowing
beings
who
looked
like
an
oscar
award
and
who
had
always
been
a
dark
one
who
looked
like
us
and
then
myself
the
dark
one
was
in
the
process
of
making
the
others
into
gods
he
had
to
teach
them
what
that
meant
by
advising
them
in
their
past
basically
he
manipulated
them
into
reproducing
and
raising
their
children
on
his
seed
he
said
that
the
little
ones
who
looked
different
were
a
subspecies
meant
to
provide
service
he
carefully
combed
through
history
rewriting
it
in
his
favor
pulling
like
a
weed
anything
that
compromised
his
control
he
enticed
recruits
by
sending
them
his
visions
saying
that
there
was
immortality
at
the
end
of
the
road
for
only
twelve
souls
kill
or
be
killed
the
amount
of
control
he
could
exert
was
finite
though
as
at
every
change
he
made
a
void
would
appear
in
our
reality
the
universe
one
day
ended
meters
from
us
it
seemed
odd
but
we
couldnt
remember
how
else
it
should
be
then
some
of
the
twelve
were
no
more
finally
when
he
could
prune
no
more
and
reality
stopped
just
beyond
his
fingertips
he
stepped
through
his
portal
to
the
past
to
bask
over
and
over
in
all
that
he
had
created
i
made
a
few
more
changes
and
lost
my
body
existing
only
on
the
wind
moral
its
very
possible
to
eliminate
from
your
reality
the
souls
whose
wills
are
not
in
harmony
with
yours
golden
rule
treat
others
as
you
wish
to
be
treated
ie
you
could
end
up
along
a
lonely
thread
of
time
with
murderers
or
flowery
brownnosers
for
playmates
its
not
eternal
theres
more
than
one
way
back
accepting
rides
to
the
past
once
here
the
one
who
looks
like
us
sells
rides
he
can
make
you
a
prince
or
a
queen
or
you
can
live
as
a
god
in
ancient
greece
go
ahead
repeat
the
third
grade
as
often
as
you
like
adam
henry
i
hope
you
like
inspecting
your
socks
careful
though
if
he
likes
your
work
but
thinks
youre
getting
wise
he
can
direct
you
to
cross
paths
with
your
old
self
and
youll
vanish
as
you
rewrite
your
own
course
of
history
none
the
wiser
as
we
pass
the
point
along
the
parallel
line
where
he
stepped
back
in
time
his
hierarchy
will
lose
its
direction
he
can
still
make
changes
while
hes
here
its
just
that
that
is
work
and
with
every
adjustment
this
becomes
less
the
world
he
cultivated
which
loosens
his
grip
and
his
organization
is
suddenly
one
branch
less
but
he
cant
see
the
change
the
basic
nature
of
man
is
good
he
had
to
apply
his
hand
to
achieve
his
world
as
he
now
tightens
his
hand
to
retain
what
he
built
the
more
sand
slips
through
his
fingers
how
about
public
computer
access
to
the

its

our

and
theyre

it

just
absolutely

a

big

are

if
they
can
do
a
margin
what
do
the

do
with
it
hold
some
on
a

to
the

sure
but
mostly
bury
it
why
food

is

hours
to

the

are
spending
all
of
their
time
to
buy
back
a
tenth
of
what
they
produce
have
we
been
deceived
if
we
are
more
efficient
why
is
it
getting
harder
to
get
by
what
if
the
point
is
just
to
keep
the
people
busy
making
widgets
in
that
other
reality
i
shouted
to
the
twelve
its
chaos
they
said
no
its
order
he
defined
chaos
as
that
which
is
he
was
not
able
to
control
rain
forest
the
problem
could
be
that
all
the
water
in
its
canopy
would
hide
the
location
of
an
indigenous
people
who
have
no
language
telepathic
and
vanishing
the
closest
knowledge
of
death
think
of
the
spine
as
a
transceiver
if
it
is
on
the
ground
and
pointed
up
you
can
locate
it
from
above
these
people
are
probably
naive
as
children
but
very
very
tough
to
kill
also
they
should
be
able
to
tell
you
stories
about
the
dark
one
that
i
talk
about
they
can
hear
him
i
think
that
ham
and
world
band
radio
old
timers
might
have
a
story
to
tell
on
this
these
people
would
be
on
a
different
frequency
than
us
as
they
arent
eating
seeds
famine
relief
when
i
make
my
diet
almost
all
whole

i
get
a
huge
belly
lose

sleep
a

and
get
sick
when
i
eat
only
fresh
fruit
i
get
more
energy
a
hollywoodflat
belly
and
need
a

less
sleep
un

keeping
there
is

killing
all
over
the

go

when
there
is
no

on
the
shelf
its
ok
to
kill
each
other
just
make
sure
there
is
enough
to
eat

what
is
disturbing
is
energetic
gun
carrying
three
foot
tall
sixteen
yearolds
who
eat
nothing
but
some
roots
that
they
suck
on
it
is
not
so
much
that
their
growth
is
stunted
it
is
that
they
arent
dying
at
a
rate
of
of
years
per
life
women
with

babes
in

historical
references
to
women
and

as
a
single
unit
could
mean
that
infants
were
not
cut
from
the
umbilical
cord
and
hence
were
not
breast
fed
i
think
that
there
may
be
some
very
interesting
results
to
this
such
as
motherchild
telepathy
and
blue
blooded
infants
there
are
examples
of
this
practice
in
the
aquatic
mammal
kingdom
to
investigate
that
guy
is
the
master
of
illusion
and
the
ultimate
liar
he
tells
it
first
and
then
just
follows
the
thread
of
time
in
which
the
people
are
willing
to
buy
it
in
which
he
can
make
it
so
hell
play
a
poker
face
up
until
he
thinks
hes
cornered
and
then
hell
whine
beg
and
grovel
all
it
means
to
him
is
that
youre
willing
to
live
on
the
ground
work
that
he
has
laid
that
is
that
he
was
right
and
he
didnt
over
play
his
hand
and
he
wont
need
to
go
back
and
try
another
thread
of
time
you
have
ultimate
control
over
your
destiny
just
dont
live
along
a
path
that
leads
to
a
reality
in
which
you
dont
want
to
be
a
part
of
i
dont
claim
to
be
the
first
to
think
these
things
its
just
that
the
others
could
have
been
pruned
from
our
path
maybe
these
thoughts
given
to
me
were
laid
down
on
the
track
of
time
after
him
subject
re
ecofreaks
forcing
space
mining
in
article
nsmcaauroraalaskaedu
writes
here
is
a
way
to
get
the
commericial
companies
into
space
and
mineral
exploration
basically
get
the
ecifreaks
to
make
it
so
hard
to
get
the
minerals
on
earth
you
think
this
is
crazy
well
in
a
way
it
is
but
in
a
way
it
is
reality
there
is
a
billin
the
congress
to
do
just
that
basically
to
make
it
so
expensive
to
mine
minerals
in
the
us
unless
you
can
by
off
the
inspectors
or
tax
collectors
ascially
what
i
understand
from
talking
to
a
few
miner
friends
of
mine
that
they
the
congress
propose
to
have
a
tax
on
the
gross
income
of
the
mine
versus
the
adjusted
income
also
the
state
governments
have
there
normal
taxes
so
by
the
time
you
get
done
paying
for
materials
workers
and
other
expenses
you
can
owe
more
than
what
you
made
basically
if
you
make
a
and
spend
ofor
expenses
you
can
owe
in
federal
taxes
bascially
it
is
driving
the
miners
off
the
land
and
the
only
peopel
who
benefit
are
the
ecofreaks
basically
to
get
back
to
my
beginning
statement
is
space
is
the
way
to
go
cause
it
might
just
get
to
expensive
to
mine
on
earth
because
of
either
the
ecofreaks
or
the
protectionist
such
fun
we
have
in
these
interesting
times
michael
adams
im
not
high
just
jacked
the
current
mining
regulations
and
fees
were
set
in
the
what
the
socalled
ecofreaks
want
to
do
is
to
simply
bring
those
fees
in
line
with
current
economic
reality
currently
mining
companies
can
get
access
to
minerals
on
public
lands
for
ridiculously
low
prices
something
like
the
mining
lobby
has
for
decades
managed
to
block
any
reform
of
these
outdated
fees
in
fact
the
latest
attempt
to
reform
them
was
again
blocked
president
clinton
compromised
by
taking
the
mining
fee
reforms
out
of
his
budget
and
plans
to
draft
separate
legislation
to
fight
that
battle
if
you

so
how

cost
as

assuming

you
a

why
must
it

pad
directly
i
mean
in
fact
you
probably
want
to
avoid
us
government
anything
for
such
a
project
the
pricetag
is
invariably
too
high
either
in
money
or
in
hassles
the
important
thing
to
realize
here
is
that
the
big
cost
of
getting
to
the
moon
is
getting
into
low
earth
orbit
everything
else
is
practically
down
in
the
noise
the
only
part
of
getting
to
the
moon
that
poses
any
new
problems
beyond
what
you
face
in
low
orbit
is
the
last
the
actual
landing
and
that
is
not
immensely
difficult
of
course
you
can
spend

you
dont

to
the
major
component
of
any
realistic
plan
to
go
to
the
moon
cheaply
for
more
than
a
brief

at
least
is
lowcost
transport
to

for
what
it
costs
to
launch
one

ivs
you
can
develop
a

system
that
will
be
considerably
cheaper
delta
clipper
might
be
a
bit
more
expensive
than
this
perhaps
but
there
are
less
ambitious
ways
of
bringing
costs
down
quite
a
bit
any
plan
for
doing
sustained
lunar
exploration
using
existing
launch
systems
is
wasting
money
in
a
big
way
given
this
questions
like
whose
launch
facilities
you
use
are
not
a
minor
detail
they
are
very
important
to
the
cost
of
the
launches
which
dominates
the
cost
of
the

heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
this
sounds
a
bit
high
to
me
still
higher
accelerations
have
been
endured
very
briefly
during
violent
deceleration
if
were
talking
sustained
acceleration
i
think
gees
has
been

i

that
any
of
this

re

a
related
question
which
i
havent
given
that
much
serious
thought
to
at
what
lattitude
is
the
average
length
of
the
day
averaged
over
the
whole
year
maximized
is
this
function
a
constant
hours
is
it
truly
symmetric
about
the
equator
or
is
there
some
discrepancy
due
to
the
fact
that
the
orbit
is
elliptic
or
maybe
the
difference
is
enough
to
change
the
temperature
and
make
the
seasons
in
the
southern
hemisphere
more
bitter
but
is
far
too
small
to
make
a

if
you
let

it
may
get

was
that

has
anyone
looked
into
the
possiblity
of
a

combo
what
would
be
the
benefits
and
problems
with
such
a
combo
other
than
the
obvious
instability
in
the
xssr
now
i
havent
seen
any
speculation
about
it
but
the
salyut
kb
design
bureau
was
planning
a
new
lhlox
second
stage
for
the
proton
which
would
boost
payload
to
leo
from
about
to
kg
geostationary
goes
from
kg
gals
launcher
version
to
kg
this
scheme
was
competing
with
the
energiam
last
year
and
i
havent
heard
which
won
except
now
i
recently
read
that
the
central
specialized
kb
was
working
on
the
successor
to
the
soyuz
booster
which
must
be
the
energiam
so
the
early
results
are
energiam
won
but
this
is
a
guess
nothing
is
very
clear
in
russia
im
sure
if
salyut
kb
gets
funds
from
someone
they
will
continue
their
development
the
centaur
for
the
altas
is
about
meters
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
thats
a
good
fit
for
their
existing
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
sets
inside
a
shround
just
under
meters
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
loads
etc
but
since
the
centaur
survives
titan
launches
which
are
probably
worse
than
the
proton
those
titan
srbs
probably
shake
things
up
pretty
good
it
seems
feasible
except
the
centaur
is
a
very
fragile
thing
and
may
require
integration
on
the
pad
which
is
not
available
now
protons
are
assembled
and
transported
horizontially
does
anyone
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolted
to
a
proton
horizontally
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erected
on
the
pad
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facilities
added
to
the
proton
pads
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actually
built
and
of
course
any
centaur
support
systems
and
facilities
no
doubt
imported
from
the
us
at
great
cost
these
systems
may
viloate

there
are

lindberghs

took
place
in
not
the
thirties
of
course
sorry
for
the
misunderstanding
i
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
far
more
aeronautical
development
took
place
in
the
for
much
of
the
the
superabundance
of
jennies

held
down
the

by
many
of
the
obsolete

aircraft
had
been
retired
and
whirlwind
had
their
powerweight
ratio
and
reliability
up
to
the
point
where
longdistance
flights
became
practical
its
important
to
note
that
the
atlantic
was
flown
not
once
but
three
times
in
lindbergh
chamberlin
and
levine
and
byrds
america
when
its
time
to
railroad
you
railroad
it
didnt
require
govt
to
fund
these
as
long
as
something
was
known
about
the
potential
for
profit
at
the
destination
in
practice
some
were
govt
funded
some
were
private
could
you
give
examples
of
privately
funded
ones
not
off
the
top
of
my
head
ill
have
to
dig
out
my
reference
books
again
however
i
will
say
that
the
most
common
arrangement
in
prince
henry
the
navigators
portugal
was
for
the
prince
to
put
up
part
of
the
money
and
merchants
to
put
up
the
rest
they
profits
from
the
voyage
would
then
be
shared
but
there
was
no
way
that
any
wise
investor
would
spend
a
large
amount
of
money
on
a
very
risky
investment
with
no
idea
of
the
possible
payoff
a
person
who
puts
up
x
billion
for
a
moon
base
is
much
more
likely
to
do
it
because
they
want
to
see
it
done
than
because
they
expect
to
make
money
off
the
deal
the
problem
is
that
the
amount
of
prize
money
required
to
inspire
a
moon
base
is
much
larger
than
any
but
a
handful
of
individuals
or
corporations
can
even
consider
putting
up
the
kremer
prizes
human
powered
aircraft
orteigs
prize
lord
northcliffes
prize
for
crossing
the
atlantic
won
in
by
alcock
and
brown
were
much
smaller
the
technologies
required
were
within
the
reach
of
individual
inventors
and
the
prize
amounts
were
well
within
the
reach
of
a
large
number
of
wealthy
individuals
i
think
that
only
a

could
afford
to
set
up

perhaps

there
are

ah
theres
the

for

youll
probably
not

ifn
you
cant

the

to

there
and
although
lower

delivery
systems
might
be
doable
without

its
doubtful
that
anyone
will
develop

course
if
a
low

there
might

i
wonder
if
there
might

some
way
of

a

to
encourage
low

payload

the
accounting
methods
would
probably
be
the
hardest
to

out

would
you
allow

and
so
forth
any
plan
for
doing
sustained
lunar
exploration
using
existing

systems
is
wasting

in
a
big
way
this
depends
on
the
how
soon
the

comes
on

in
other
words
perhaps
a

deal
of
worthwhile
technology
life
support
navigation
etc
could
be
developed
prior

you
wouldnt

hate

oops
i

i

id
simplify
this
to

that

a

if
your

is

in

then
perhaps
its

if

maybe
a

lockheed

they
should

about

i

i
assume
they

found

how

it

since

you
might
just

a

questions
for
those
frothing
at

ask
themselves
how

this

supposed

sounds
like
it
would
have
a
huge
drag

not
a

be
in

just
what
orbital

are
we
talking

here
what
real

are
we
talking
about
really
how
many
optical
astronomers
are
really
going
to
be
impacted
which
is
more
important
adding
a
few
extra
days
of

optical

getting
the

the

the

would

one

the
other
since
the

is
being
used

your
answer
to

was
the
astronomers

feel
free
to
come
up

some

way

to
my

more

whats
new
in
my
opinion
friday
april
washington
dc
now
space
marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
this
sounds
like
something
lowell
wood
would
think
of
does
anyone
know
if
hes
involved
no
the
idea
was
suggested
around
here
during
discussions
of
possible
nearterm
commercial
space
activities
one
of
the
folks
involved
in
those
discussions
a
spacecraft
engineer
named
preston
carter
passed
the
suggestion
on
to
some
entreprenurial
types
and
mike
lawson
is
apparently
going
ahead
with
it
preston
is
now
at
llnl
and
is
working
with
space
marketing
on
the
sensors
that
might
be
carried
nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
actually
that
sounds
unlikely
i
dont
know
what
the
launch
vehicle
would
be
but
i
would
expect
it
to
go
on
a
commercial
launcher
certainly
not
on
the
shuttle
and
the
fraction
of
the
cost
paid
to
nasa
for
eg
launch
support
would
probably
cover
nasas
incremental
costs
pretty
well
this
may
look
like
environmental
vandalism
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
marketing
told
us
yesterday
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
he
explainedadvertising
is
just
to
help
defray
costs
this
may
be
the
purpose
for
the
university
of
colorado
people
my
guess
is
that
the
purpose
for
the
livermore
people
is
to
learn
how
to
build
large
inflatable
space
structures
no
as
noted
llnl
is
involved
in
lightweight
sensor
design
per
clementine
and
related
programs
im
sure
folks
around
here
would
like
to
see
a
demonstration
of
a
modern
inflatable
structure
but
after
all
the
us
did
the
echo
satellites
long
ago
and
an
advertising
structure
would
not
be
much
closer
to
an
inflatable
space
station
than
echo
was
or
a
parade
balloon
for
that
matter
what
do
you
think
of
this
revolting
and
hideous
attempt
to
vandalize
the
night
sky
it
is
not
even
april
anymore
while
i
happen
to
personally
dislike
the
idea
mostly
because
ive
got
a
background
in
astronomy
its
hardly
vandalism
it
would
be
a
shortlived
intrusion
on
the
night
sky
doing
no
permanent
damage
and
actually
hurting
only
a
small
subset
of
astronomers
on
the
other
hand
it
would
certainly
draw
attention
to
space
if
this
is
true
i
think
its
a
great
idea
learning
how
to
build
structures
in
space
in
an
essential
step
towards
space
development
which
unfortunately
this
is
not
likely
to
contribute
much
to
if
such
a
project
also
monitors
ozone
depletion
and
demonstrates
creative
use
of
partial
private
sector
funding
in
the
process
so
much
the
better
is
nasa
really
supporting
this
junk
as
far
as
i
know
its
a
purely
commercial
venture
and
does
anyone
have
any
more
details
other
than
what
was
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
serious
is
this
project
is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have
real
funding
i
gather
it
is
being
very
seriously
discussed
with
possible
advertisers
commercial
projects
however
generally
dont
get
funding
they
get
customers
whether
it
will
have
customers
remains
to
be
seen
are
protesting
groups
being
organized
in
the
states
not
yet
though
if
this
project
goes
through
i
suppose
the
return

that
the

yup
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of

isnt
this

not

even
mention
the

of
locating
a

nope
its
not
illegal
it
is
however
closely
regulated
in

to
purchase

required
it

there

the

the

use

depending

size
the

setback
is

by
the

rockets

are

the
higher
altitude
rockets
can
reach
up

most
of

only
get
to

the
typical
rocket
is
to
inches
in
diameter
and
carries
a
to

parachute
or
multiple
parachutes
depending
on
the
payload
many
rockets
also
carry
either
a

at

in
the

where
there
are

hello
i
am
looking
for
a
program
or
algorithm
that
can
be
used
to
compute
sunrise
and
sunset
times
here
is
a
computation
i
did
a
long
time
ago
that
computes
the
length
of
the
daylight
you
should
be
able
to
convert
the
information
here
to
sunrise
and
sunset
times
sorry
not
so
the
changes
in
sunrise
and
sunset
times
are
not
quite
synchronized
for
example
neither
the
earliest
sunrise
nor
the
latest
sunset
comes
on
the
longest
day
of
the
year
you
can
derive
day
length
from
sunrise
and
sunset
times
but
not
viceversa

other
idea
for

crafts
is
as
navigation
beacons
and
such
why
not
because
to
be
any
use
as
a
nav
point
you
need
to
know
exactly
where
it
is
which
means
you
either
nail
it
to
something
that
doesnt
move
or
you
watch
it
all
the
time
neither
of
which
is
possible
on
a
deactivated
spacecraft
then
you
have
to
know
exactly
how
far
away
from
it
you
are
this
may
or
may
not
be

besides
the
mechanical
problems
of
moving
so
dense
a
medium
in
oan
out
of
the
lungs
diaphragm
fatigue
etc
is
there
likely
to
be
a
problem
with
the
mixture
i
mean
since
the
lungs
never
expel
all
the
air
in
them
the
inhaled
air
has
to
mix
pretty
quickly
with
the
residual
air
in
the
lungs
to
provide
a
useful
partial
pressure
of
oxygen
right
would
this
mixing
be
substantially
fasterslower
at
the
pressures
were
talking
about
there
was
an
interesting
article
in
scientific
american
some
time
ago
about
breathing
liquid
it
was
a
few
months
before
the
abyss
came
out
as
far
as
i
can
remember
they
mentioned
three
things
that
were
difficult
to
do
at
once
with
a
substitute
breathing
fluid
low
viscosity
if
its
too
difficult
to
force
the
fluid
in
out
of
the
lungs
you
cant
extract
enough
oxygen
to
power
your
own
breathing
effort
let
alone
anything
else
diffusion
rate
obviously
not
all
the
air
in
your
lungs
is
expelled
when
you
breathe
out
and
the
part
that
isnt
expelled
is
the
part
thats
nearest
the
walls
of
the
alveoli
alveolus
so
the
trip
from
the
blood
vessels
to
the
new
air
has
to
be
done
by
diffusion
of
the
gas
through
the
fluid
apparently
oxygen
tends
to
diffuse
more
readily
than
so
even
if
you
can
get
enough
oxygen
in
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
enough
out
capacity
you
have
to
be
able
to
dissolve
enough
gas
per
unit
volume
oh
and
of
course
your
new
breathing
fluid
must
not
irritate
the
lungs
or
interfere
with
their
healing
or
anything
like
that

tffreebaindyvaxiupuiedu
writes
in
my
first
posting
on
this
subject
i
threw
out
an
idea
of
how
to
fund
such
a
contest
without
delving
to
deep
into
the
budget
i
mentioned
granting
mineral
rights
to
the
winner
my
actual
wording
was
mining
rights
somebody
pointed
out
quite
correctly
that
such
rights
are
not
anybodys
to
grant
although
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
fait
accompli
situation
for
the
winner
so
how
about
this
give
the
winning
group
i
cant
see
one
company
or
corp
doing
it
a
or
year
moratorium
on
taxes
tom
freebairn
who
says
there
is
no
mineral
rights
to
be
given
who
says
the
un
or
the
us
government
major
question
is
if
you
decide
to
mine
the
moon
or
mars
who
will
stop
you
the
un
cant
other
than
legal
tom
foolerie
can
the
truly
inforce
it
if
you
go
to
the
moon
as
declare
that
you
are
now
a
soverign
nation
who
will
stop
you
from
doing
it
maybe
not
acknowledge
you
why
cant
a
small
company
or
corp
or
organization
go
an
explore
the
great
beyond
of
space
what
right
does
earth
have
to
say
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not
maybe
i
am
a
few
years
ahead
on
this
it
is
liek
the
old
catholic
church
stating
which
was
portugals
and
what
was
spains
and
along
came
the
reformation
and
made
it
all
null
and
void
what
can
happen
is
to
find
a
nation
which
is
acknowledged
and
offer
your
services
as
a
space
miner
and
then
go
mine
the
asteroidsmarsmoon
or
what
ever
as
long
as
yur
sponsor
does
not
get
in
trouble
basically
find
a
country
who
wants
to
go
into
space
but
cant
for
soem
reason
or
another
but
who
will
give
you
a
home
such
as
saudia
arabia
or
whatever
there
are
nations
in
the
world
who
are
not
part
of
the
un
got
to
them
and
offer
your
services
and
such
i
know
that
sound
crazy
but
is
it
also
once
you
have
the
means
to
mine
the
moon
or
whatever
then
just
do
it
the
un
if
done
right
can
be
made
to
be
so
busy
with
something
else
they
will
not
care
if
your
worried
about
the
us
do
the
same
thing
why
be
limited
by
the
short
sighted
people
of
earth
after
all
they
have
many
other
things
to
worry
about
that
if
someone
is
mining
the
moon
or
mars
or
what
ever
basically
what
i
am
saying
is
where
is
that
drive
of
yeasteryears
to
go
a
little

farther
out

re

i
remember
seeing
an

where
this
idea
was
touched
upon
it
might
have
been
some
other
tv
show
if
nothing
else
i
know
such
liquids
are
possible
because
they
showed
a
large
glass
full
of
this
liquid
and
put
a
white
mouse
rat
in
it
since
the
liquid
was
not
dense
the
mouse
would
float
so
it
was
held
down
by
tongs
clutching
its
tail
the
thing
struggled
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
certainly
held
down
long
enough
so
that
it
was
breathing
the
liquid
it
never
did
slow
down
in
its
frantic
attempts

swim

this
may

were
deemed
appropriate
said
milt

lead
flight
director
for

while
the
five

will
be
unprecedented
the
use
of
two

will
alleviate
placing

said
in

it

underwater

will
practice
individual

in
each
spacewalk
various
refinements
to
the
specific
tasks
on
each
spacewalk
will
be
made
based
on
actual
training
experience
during
the
months
prior
to
the
mission
also
lessons
learned
from
other
spacewalks
leading
up
to
the
flight
will
be
valuable
in
assisting
the
crew
in
its
training
techniques
endeavours
june

both
will
include
spacewalks
to
evaluate
some
of
the
unique

to

on
the

the

the

sirtf
a
major

considered

a

is
alive
and
well
according
to
project
scientist
michael
werner
a
lighter

revised
orbit
and
shorter
mission
have
added
up
to
a
less
expensive
project
with
tremendous
scientific
power
and
a
bright

said
werner
designed
as
a
followup
to
the
highly
successful
infrared
astronomical
satellite
iras
and
cosmic
background
explorer
cobe
missions
sirtf

is

if

iras
pioneering
work
in
spacebased
infrared
astronomy
years
ago
allowed
astronomers
to
view
the
milky
way
as
never
before
and
revealed
among
other
things
galaxies
and
comets
it
provided
a
sky
survey
times
more
sensitive
than
any
previously
available
from
groundbased
observations
cobe
has
measured
the
infrared
and
microwave
background
radiation
on
large
angular
scales
and
revealed
new
facts
about
the
early
universe
but
to
illuminate
sirtfs
potential
jim
evans
jpls
manager
of
astrophysics
and
fundamental
physics
preprojects
recently
said
that
the
project
is
to
million
times
more
capable
than
iras
based
on
technological
advances
in
infrared
detector
arrays
however
despite
the
enormous
strides
in
infrared
exploration
sirtf
promised
and
the
fact
that
it
was
cited
as
the
highest
priority
new
initiative
for
all
of
astronomy
in
the
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
it
took
a
diet
or
die
directive
from
nasa
headquarters
last
year
to
keep
the
project
going
according
to
werner
the
project
is
now
known
as
atlas
sirtf
based
on
the
key
factor
in
its
new
design
the
satellite
will
orbit
the
sun
instead
of
the
earth
permitting
the
use
of
an
atlas
rocket
launch
instead
of
the
formerly
proposed
and
heavier
titan
the
main
advantage
of
the
solar
orbit
is
that
you
can
use
all
of
your
launch
capability
for
boosting
the
payload
you
dont
have
to
carry
up
a
second
rocket
to
circularize
the
orbit
werner
said
the
other
advantage
to
a
solar
orbit
he
said
is
that
its
in
a
better
thermal
environment
away
from
the
heat
of
the
earth
additional
major
changes
in
sirtfs
redesign
include
shortening
the
mission
from
five
to
three
years
and
building
a
spacecraft
that
is
less
than
half
as
heavy
as
in
the
original
plan
atlas
sirtf
will
weigh
kilograms
pounds
compared
to
titan
sirtfs
kilograms
pounds
all
of
that
adds
up
to
a
less
stressful
launch
environment
werner
said
and
a
cost
savings
of
more
than
million
for
the
launch
in
addition
to
increased
savings
in
the
design
of
the
smaller
less
massive
spacecraft
werner
said
sirtfs
redesign
came
as
a
result
of
congress
telling
nasa
youre
trying
to
do
too
many
things
if
you
want
us
to
support
sirtf
which
is
a
good
project
develop
a
plan
to
see
how
it
fits
into
nasas
overall
strategy
shortly
thereafter
sirtf
was
named
as
nasas
highest
priority
flagship
scientific
mission
by
the
interdisciplinary
space
sciences
advisory
committee
in
addition
to
the
blessing
from
the
national
academy
of
sciences
while
the
spacecraft
and
its
instruments
required
descoping
to
keep
the
project
alive
sirtfs
major
scientific
contribution
always
promised
to
come
about
from
its
advanced
infrared
detector
arrays
which
will
allow
images
to
be
developed
tens
of
thousands
of
times
faster
than
before
according
to
evans
up
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
werner
said
all
infrared
astronomy
was
done
with
single
detectors
or
very
small
arrays
of
individually
assembled
detectors
since
then
the
department
of
defense
has
developed
a
program
to
produce
arrays
of
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
detectors
rather
than
just
a
few
and
those
are
very
well
suited
for
use
on
sirtf
werner
noted
that
in
addition
to
dealing
with
budget
pressures
congress
is
currently
watching
nasa
projects
with
an
eye
out
for
any
technological
spinoff
on
that
question
i
think
we
have
some
things
to
say
he
said
because
the
detectors
were
using
are
straight
off
various
military
developments
also
sirtf
will
be
built
by
the
us
aerospace
industry
and
its
a
real
technological
and
engineering
challenge
in
addition
to
being
a
tremendous
scientific
project
sirtf
will
be
used
by
the
entire
astronomical
community
werner
added
but
the
revised
threeyear
mission
puts
a
premium
on
observing
time
we
have
to
educate
the
user
community
and
develop
a
program
that
involves
early
surveys
and
quick
turnaround
of
the
data
werner
said
the
downsizing
of
the
project
required
a
reduction
in
scope
and
complexity
of
sirtfs
three
instruments
the
infrared
spectrograph
infrared
array
camera
and
multiband
imaging
photometer
however
these
reductions
will
only
result
in
losses
of
efficiency
rather
than
capability
he
said
the
project
hopes
to
start
a
phase
b
activity
in
which
will
provide
a
detailed
concept
for
development
and
design
building
the
hardware
would
begin
about
two
years
later
projected
cost
estimates
evans
said
are
million
i
am
very
optimistic
about
sirtf
he
said
it
will
provide
a
tremendous
return
for
the
investment
werner
added
that
an
additional
benefit
from
the
project
will
be
the
enrichment
of
our
intellectual
and
cultural
environment
people
on
the
street
are
very
interested
in
astronomy
black
holes
the
possibility
of
life
on
other
planets
the
origin
of
the

and
those
are
the
kind
of
questions
sirtf
will
help
answer

both
spacecraft
will
team
up

hope
will
expand

while
the

will
exploit
a

to
conduct

each
satellite
will
point
at
a

target
for
roughly
hours
while
approximately
groundbased
radio
telescopes
will
simultaneously
point
at
the

object
while

according
to
dr
joel
smith
jpls
project
manager
for

vlbi

like
those
held

will
permit
japan

who

to
establish
working
relationships
with
the
radio

communities
that
will
be
vital
during
the
complex
observations
required
by
the
space
vlbi
project
one
of
our
main
activities
is
developing
the
methodology
for
international
coordination
because
the
two
spacecraft
simultaneously
rely
on
the
corresponding
tracking
stations
while
using
the
groundbased
radio

to
observe
the
same
celestial

said

three
new

are
being
built
at

and
other
three
other
tracking
facilities
located
in
japan
russia
and
green
bank
wva
this
global
network
of

will
use

and
highspeed

to
collect

data
and
forward
the
information
to
a
correlator
located
at
the
national

in

nm
the
correlator
will
combine
and
process
data
then
make
it
available
to

investigators
in
moscow
tokyo
and
jpl
via
electronic

smith
is
optimistic
that
the
massive
radio
telescope
created
by
the
space
vlbi
network
will
provide
radio
astronomers
with
better
resolution
than
has
ever
been
achieved
before
by
groundbased
radio
telescopes
allowing
astronomers
to
take
a
closer
look
at
distant

in

there
is
a
long
history
of

smith
what
we
intend
to
do
is
to
extend
radio
astronomy
into
earth
orbit
our
goal
is
to
look
deeper
into
the
cores
of
galactic
nuclei
quasars
and
other
active
radio
sources
to
understand
what
drives
those
things
we
have
seen
so
far
with
radio
astronomy
smith
noted
that
if
one
examines
the
active
galactic
nuclei
youll
find
jets
appearing
to
spew
at
speeds
greater
than
light
and
at
energy
levels
that
are
millions
of
times
greater
than
you
would
expect
he
said
some
astronomers
believe
that
black
holes
may
be
located
in
the
cores
of
these
galaxies
and
that
they
may
fuel
the
jets
smith
hopes
that
by
using
space
vlbi
to
look
further
into
the
cores
this
theory
may
be
supported
or
disproved
russian

hardware
including
transponders
and
transmitters
are
now
being
tested
in
the
united
states
and
japanese

is
scheduled
to
arrive
for
testing
later
this
year
analysis
of
this
hardware
will
permit
us
scientists
and
engineers
to
understand
how
to
modify
the
highspeed
vlba
correlator
operating
at
the
nrao
in
order
to
accommodate
the
odd
data
patterns
that
will
originate
from
the
more
than
groundbased
radio
telescopes
involved
in
space
vlbi
smith
is
particularly
pleased
that
meetings
with
the
japanese
and
russian
space
agency
officials
like
those
held
at
jpl
in
march
have
proceeded
smoothly
yet
he
knows
that
the
political
uncertainty
in
russia
could
jeopardize
that
countrys
participation
in
the
project
nothing
is
ever
smooth
he
said
but
the
russians
have
been
incredibly
open
with
us
we
always
anticipated
some
likelihood
that
we
will
not
succeed
because
of
political
factors
beyond
our
control
yet
there
tends
to
be
a
way
of
keeping
these
things
going
because
scientists
on
both
sides
are
trying
hard
and
people
recognize
the
value
of
cooperation
at
this
level
smith
points
out
that
the
japanese
space
agency
has
more
at
stake
than
just
fulfilling
an
international
commitment
to
a
science
mission
the
japanese
have
been
extremely
cooperative
since
international
cooperation
is
essential
to
their
science
mission
he
said
but
smith
also
noted
that
japanese
space
agency
officials
look
at
the
us
space
vlbi
mission
as
an
opportunity
to
showcase
the
technology
involved
with
vsop
spacecraft
and
their
highly
regarded
mach
v
launch
vehicle
yet
regardless
of
the
risks
involved
in
undertaking
such
an
ambitious
project
jpls
smith
is
satisfied
that
planning
for
the
space
vlbi
project
is
beyond
the
significant
financial
and
political
hurdles
that
otherwise
might
threaten
the
project
fortunately
we
have
the
virtue
of
having
two
partners
and
if
either
falls
out
we
would
still
have
something
with
the
other
by
themselves
both
spacecraft
are
independent
scientifically
exciting

this

which
he
calls
geode
rough
on

but
a
gem
on
the
inside
or
the
et
strongback
with
integrated
hab
modules
and
centrifuge
as
you
can
see
from
file
geodeagif
it
uses
a
space
shuttle
external
tank
et
in
place
of
much
of
the
truss
which
is
currently
part
of
space
station
freedom
the
white
track
on
the
outside
of
the
et
is
used
by
the
station
remonte
manipulator
system
srms
and
by
the
reaction
control
system
rcs
pod
this
allows
the
rcs
pod
to
move
along
the
track
so
that
thrusting
can
occur
near
the
center
of
gravity
cg
of
the
station
as
the
mass
properties
of
the
station
change
during
assembly
the
inline
module
design
allows
the
shuttle
to
dock
more
easily
because
it
can
approach
closer
to
the
stations
cg
and
at
a
structurally
strong
part
of
the
station
in
the
current
ssf
design
docking
forces
are
limited
to
pounds
which
seriously
constrains
the
design
of
the
docking
system
the
et
would
have
a
hatch
installed
preflight
with
little
additional
launch
mass
weve
always
had
the
ability
to
put
an
et
into
orbit
contrary
to
some
rumors
which
have
circulated
here
but
weve
never
had
a
reason
to
do
it
while
we
have
had
some
good
reasons
not
to
performance
penalties
control
debris
generation
and
eventual
deorbit
and
impact
footprint
once
onorbit
we
would
vent
the
residual
the
et
insulation
sofi
either
a
erodes
onorbit
from
impact
with
atomic
oxygen
or
b
stays
where
it
is
and
we
deploy
a
kevlar
sheath
around
it
to
protect
it
and
keep
it
from
contaminating
the
local
space
environment
option
b
has
the
advantage
of
providing
further
micrometeor
protection
the
et
is
incredibly
strong
remember
it
supports
the
whole
stack
during
launch
and
could
serve
as
the
nucleus
for
a
much
more
ambitious
design
as
budget
permits
the
white
module
at
the
end
of
et
contains
a
set
of
control
moment
gyros
to
be
used
for
attitude
control
while
the
rcs
will
be
used
for
gyro
desaturation
the
module
also
contains
a
deorbit
system
which
can
be
used
at
the
end
of
the
stations
life
to
perform
a
controlled
deorbit
so
we
dont
kill
any
more
kangaroos
like
we
did
with
skylab
the
centrifuge
which
has
the

volume
as
a
hab
module
could
be
used
for
longterm
studies
of
the
effects
of
lunar
or
martian
gravity
on
humans
the
centrifuge
will
be
used
as
a
momentum
storage
device
for
the
whole
attitude
control
system
the
centrifuge
is
mounted
on
one
of
the
modules
opposite
the
et
and
the
solar
panels
this
design
uses
most
of
the
existing
ssf
designs
for
electrical
data
and
communication
systems
getting
leverage
from
the
ssf
work
done

hi

the

the

acting
on
them
when
and
if
they
try
to
gain
an
initial
acceleration
by
passing
close

the
magnitude
of
such
accelerations
he
estimated
to
be

also
says
that
this
is
may
not
be
a

problem
for

because
humans
and
this
was

in
have
already

of

this
is

heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in

humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of

if
these
are
possible
what
is
used

absorb
the

can
this
be
extended
to
larger
accelerations
are
you
sure
is
the

as

working
with
university

on
a

to

the
real

of

is
to

the

i

on

brightness
venus

nobody
complains
about
that
besides
its

so
it
would
only
be
visible
during
twilight
when
the
sky
is
already
bright
and
even
if
it
would
have
some
miniscule
impact
it
would
be
only
for

the

of
nikola

by

this
remarkable
conductivity
of

including
the

at

led
tesla
to
suggest
in
a
published
statement
in
a
system
of
lighting
on
a
terrestrial
scale
in
which
he
proposed
to
treat
the
whole
earth
with
its
surrounding

as
if
it
were
a

the
whole

would
be
transformed
into
a

with

completely

making
the

as
bright

now
my
comments
id
like
to
add
that
some
of
the
protests
do
not
come
from
a
strictly
practical
consideration
of
what
pollution
levels
are
acceptable
for
research
activities
by
professional
astronomers
some
of
what
i
would
complain
about
is
rooted
in
aesthetics
many
readers
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heavens
were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
the
effect
of
the
first
sputniks
and
echo
etc
on
this
view
could
only
happen
once
to
see
a
light
crossing
the
night
sky
and
know
it
was
put
there
by
us
puny
people
is
still
impressive
and
the
sense
of
size
one
gets
by
assimilating
the
scales
involved
is
also
awesome
even
if
the
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
involved
is
still
dwarfed
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
there
is
still
a
hunger
for
the
pure
beauty
of
a
virgin
sky
yes
i
know
aircraft
are
almost
always
in
sight
i
have
to
live
in
a
very
populated
area
miles
from
an
international
airport
currently
where
light
pollution
on
the
ground
is
ghastly
the
impact
of
humans
is
so
extreme
here
virtually
no
place
exists
that
has
not
been
shaped
sculpted
modified
trashed
or
whipped
into
shape
by
the
hands
of
man
in
some
places
the
only
life
forms
larger
than
bacteria
are
humans
cockroaches
and
squirrels

i
visited
some
friends
up
in
the
appalacian
mountains
one
weekend
getting
away
from
it
all
paved
roads
indoor
plumbing
malls
and
it
felt
good
for
a
while
then
i
quickly
noticed
the
hollow
was
directly
under
the
main
flight
path
into
dulles
miles
to
the
east
their
security
light
didnt
help
matters
much
either
but
ive
heard
the
artic
wilderness
gets
lots
of
high
air
traffic
so
i
know
the
skies
are
rarely
perfect
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i
mean
theyve
been
trying
this
forever
like

wow

i
can

how
disgusting

advertisements
would
be
if
seen
up
so
high
if
ya
gotta
make
a
buck
on
it
displaying
products
in
heaven
at
least
consider
the
reactions
from
those
for
whom
the
sky
is
a
last
beautiful
refuge
from
the
baseness
of
modern
life
to
be
open
about
this

my

tonight

it

an

ill
be
trying

see
it
if
i
can
it
is
my

so
i
suppose
i
could
be
called
an
elitist
for
supporting
this
intrusion
on
the

sky
while
complaining
about

if
it

the

derived
orbital

dcy
is

sort

sideways
not

so
why
is
the

look
symmetric
in

ive

i
would
think
that
an
asymmetric
design
sort
of
like
wingless

may
work
better
since
less

please
assume
that
all

permission
is
granted
to

this
without

note
for
newbies
the
delta

project
is
geared
towards
producing
a
single
staget
to
orbit
reusable
launch
vehicle
the
dcx
vehicle
is
a
scale
vehicle
designed
to
test
some
of
the
concepts
invovled
in
ssto
it
is
currently
undergoing
tests
the
dcy

nelson
of
macdonnell
douglas
gave
a
talk
entitled
optimizing
techniques
for
advanced
space
missions
here
at
the
university
of
illinois
mr
nelsons
job
involves
using
software
to
simulate
trajectories
and
determine
the
optimal
trajectory
within
given
requirements
although
he
is
not
directly
involved
with
the
delta
clipper
project
he
has
spent
time
with
them
recently
using
his
software
for
their
applications
he
thus
used
the
dcy
project
for
most
of
his
examples
while
i
dont
think
the
details
of
implicit
trajectory
simulation
are
of
much
interest
to
the
readers
i
hope
they
arent
i
fell
asleep
during
that
part
i
think
that
many
of
you
will
be
interested
in
some
of
the
details
gleaned
from
the
examples
the
first
example
given
was
the
maximization
of
payload
for
a
polar
orbit
the
main
restriction
is
that
acceleration
must
remain
below
gs
i
assume
that
this
is
driven
by
passenger
constraints
rather
than
hardware
constraints
but
i
did
not
verify
that
the
delta
clipper
y
version
has
engines
boosters
and
sustainers
the
boosters
which
have
a
lower
isp
are
shut
down
in
midflight
thus
one
critical
question
is
when
to
shut
them
down
mr
nelson
showed
the
following
plot
of
acceleration
vs
time
g
as
ascii
graphs
go
this
is
actually
fairly
good
the
big
difference
is
that
the
lines
g
made
by
the
should
be
curves
which
are
concave
up
the
data
is
only
approximate
as
the
graph
wasnt
up
for
very
long
g
g
sec
sec
as
mentioned
before
a
critical
constraint
is
that
g
levels
must
be
kept
below
initially
all
eight
engines
are
started
as
the
vehicle
burns
fuel
the
accelleration
increases
as
it
gets
close
to
the
booster
engines
are
throtled
back
however
they
quickly
become
inefficient
at
low
power
so
it
soon
makes
more
sense
to
cut
them
off
altogether
this
causes
the
dip
in
accelleration
at
about
seconds
eventually
the
remaining
sustainer
engines
bring
the
g
level
back
up
to
about
and
then
hold
it
there
until
they
cut
out
entirely
the
engine
cutoff
does
not
acutally
occur
in
orbit
the
trajectory
is
aimed
for
an
altitude
slightly
higher
than
the
desired
and
the
last
vestiges
of
air
drag
slow
the
vehicle
slightly
thus
lowering
the
final
altitude
to
that
desired
questions
from
the
audience
paraphrased
q
would
it
make
sense
to
shut
down
the
booster
engines
in
pairs
rather
than
all
at
once
a
very
perceptive
worth
considering
they
have
not
yet
done
the
simulation
shutting
down
all
four
was
part
of
the
problem
as
given
q
so
what
was
the
final
payload
for
this
trajectory
a
cant
tell
us
read
aviation
leak
he
also
apparently
had
a
good
propulsion
example
but
was
told
not
to
use
it
my
question
does
anyone
know
if
this
security
is
due
to
sdio
protecting
national
security
or
md
protecting
their
own
interests
the
second
example
was
reentry
simulation
from
orbit
to
just
before
the
pitch
up
maneuver
the
biggest
constraint
in
this
one
is
aerodynamic
heating
and
the
parameter
they
were
trying
to
maximize
was
crossrange
he
showed
graphs
of
heating
using
two
different
models
to
show
that
both
were
very

michael
sternberg
cheif
of
operations
of
rimsat
was
invited
to
speak
at
an
informal
lunch
held
by
acdis
here
on
the
campus
of
the
university
of
illinois
acdis
is
an
organization
on
campus
that
deals
with
arms
control
disarmament
and
international
security
rimsat
was
considered
an
appropriate
topic
because
the
company
is
using
russian
launchers
and
satellites
i
think
it
also
helped
that
his
daughter
is
a
grad
student
in
the
international
relations
program
the
concept
behind
rimsat
apparently
began
when
matt
neilson
went
to
tonga
to
visit
a
friend
while
he
was
there
he
somehow
ended
up
visiting
the
king
who
happened
to
be
a
big
tv
fan
matt
bought
the
king
a
satellite
dish
which
the
king
thought
was
really
nifty
since
tonga
has
a
gnp
of
about
million
his
majesty
asked
if
there
was
any
way
to
make
money
off
this
matt
thought
there
probably
was
so
at
his
suggestion
tonga
applied
for
geosynchronous
satellite
slots
while
this
isnt
entirely
off
the
wall
it
was
very
unusual
seeing
as
tonga
was
a
tiny
kingdom
with
no
space
program
and
is
a
lot
of
slots
the
whole
thing
was
debated
in
the
appropriate
regulatory
agency
and
carl
hilliard
who
is
apparently
a
respected
space
lawyer
wrote
several
opinions
supporting
tongas
case
eventually
tonga
ended
up
with
slots
ranging
from
e
to
e
slots
are
designated
by
the
longitude
over
which
they
reside
according
to
sternberg
four
of
these
from
e
to
e
are
the
best
in
the
world
because
they
are
excellently
placed
for
communications
between
hawaii
and
the
pacific
rim
rimsat
was
formed
to
use
these
slots
it
was
officially
formed
in
nevis
as
a
tax
haven
they
tried
for
a
few
years
to
raise
funds
in
the
west
however
to
fill
slots
with
western
satellites
launched
on
western
launchers
would
have
cost
approximately
billion
its
not
easy
to
raise
that
kind
of
money
eventually
they
hit
upon
the
idea
of
using
russian
hardware
they
began
negotiating
with
glavkosmos
for
hardware
mr
sternberg
describes
operating
in
moscow
in
such
harsh
terms
that
i
dont
think
ill
visit
there
for
a
long
time
besides
a
significant
lack
of
creature
comforts
he
was
not
happy
with
the
way
that
people
operate
for
example
everybody
can
sell
you
everything
everyone
can
show
the
proper
documents
and
licenses
that
indicate
they
are
the
only
ones
who
have
the
authority
to
sell
what
ever
you
want
to
by
eventually
rimsat
arranged
a
deal
with
glavkosmos
for
satellites
at
a
cost
of
million
however
glavkosmos
lost
favor
after
the
coup
sternberg
says
that
this
is
because
they
were
basically
a
bunch
of
kgb
operatives
who
went
to
trade
shows
and
picked
up
lots
of
brochures
since
glavkosmos
was
out
of
power
he
had
to
renegotiate
the
deal
with
the
new
authorities
he
again
described
life
in
a
moscow
hotel
in
rather
unfavorable
terms
eventually
he
worked
out
a
deal
and
on
dec
he
met
with
koptev
who
heads
the
russian
space
program
to
sign
the
deal
koptev
insisted
on
a
few
concessions
before
signing
and
according
to
sternberg
he
arranged
these
new
rules
to
allow
himself
to
form
another
company
to
do
the
exact
same
thing
as
rimsat
the
next
step
was
to
meet
with
the
builders
of
the
hardware
npo
applied
mechanics
npo
pm
to
use
their
acronym
this
organization
is
located
in
siberia
cant
figure
out
how
to
spell
the
town
i
need
an
atlas
and
has
built
about
vehicles
since
the
dawn
of
the
space
age
sternberg
commented
that
siberians
are
very
different
from
musovites
they
are
hard
workers
honest
people
who
team
up
to
get
things
done
very
much
like
midwesterners
at
this
point
there
were
some
comments
from
the
audience
that
agreed
with
his
opinion
on
both
siberians
and
midwesterners
sternberg
had
lots
of
good
things
to
say
about
npo
pm
his
company
is
apparently
lookng
for
million
to
invest
in
the
firm
to
become
partnersit
apparently
costs
the
russians
about
million
to
build
a
satellite
that
would
sell
for
million
in
the
west
if
you
want
to
give
them
specifications
theyll
build
you
a
satellite
for
the
particular
satellites
that
rimsat
will
be
using
costs
run
about
per
transponder
year
this
compares
to
ty
in
the
us
they
can
sell
their
time
for
about
million
compared
to
million
in
the
us
rimsat
will
launch
their
satellites
on
protons
to
get
the
best
prices
they
bought
in
bulk
they
have
the
rights
to
twelve
launches
so
if
any
of
you
need
a
lift
i
can
give
you
their
address
the
first
launch
is
scheduled
for
october
and
they
are
getting
one
used
satellite
from
the
russians
which
is
being
moved
into
place
now
tidbits
sternberg
says
this
kind
of
thing
has
to
be
done
by
entrepreneurs
not
big
business
because
big
business
is
just
like
what
they
have
over
there
except
that
we
have
better
paper
both
in
the
bathroom
and
in
the
copier
russian
launches
are
self
insured
the
promise
to
replace
a
failed
launch
within
months
major
investors
in
rimsat
include
russell
which
is
a
huge
retirement
fund
organization
cellsat
which
is
a
big
telecom
business
in
southeast
asia
and
a
fund
operated
by
some
of
the
big
names
in
us
aerospace
which
he
says
is
sort
of
an
insurance
policy
for
them
if
this
really
takes
off
he
downplayed
the
instabilites
in
the
exussr
saying
that
we
are
worried
partly
because
we
arent
used
to
seeing
russia
as
anything
but
an
unvarying
monolith
italy
gets
a
new
government
every
two
weeks
but
we
dont
worry
because
were
used
to
it
he
predicted
that
once
we
get
used
to
seeing
what
really
goes
on
in
russia
we
wont
worry
about
their
stability
as
much
part
of
the
problem
with
cooperative
ventures
is
the
problem
of
transfering
money
the
central
bank
has
a
policy
of
taking
hard
currency
payments
putting
in
their
coffers
and
replacing
the
rest
with
the
equivalent
value
in
rubles
to
get
around
this
rimsat
pays
their
hard
currency
into
an
austrian
bank
account
npo
pm
then
pays
their
contractors
with
foreign
currency
so
that
the
only
the
contractors
get
swindled
by
the
government
one
of
the
big
problems
rimsat
has
had
is
stonewalling
by
the
western
satellite
industry
however
intelsat
recently
bought
three
of
the
same
type
of
satellites
which
was
rather
reassuring
the
biggest
worry
most
people
have
about
russian
satellites
is
the
primitive
technology
and
shorter
lifetime
the
older
gorizont
horizon
satellites
have
a
lifetime
of
about
years
while
the
more
modern
express
satellites
compare
well
with
western
technology
and
last
about
years
while
this
is
much
shorter
than
years
for
western
satellites
sternberg
downplayed
the
difference
at
these
prices
they
can
afford
to
launch
new
ones
in
addition
shorter
lifetimes
mean
that
they
can
replace
their
equipment
with
newer
technology
so
they
will
be
able
to
compete
better
than
older
out
of
date

they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at

ranges
gamma
ray
bursts
grbs
are
seen
coming
equally
from
all
directions
however
given
the
number
of
bright
ones
there
are
too
few
faint
ones
to
be
consistent
with
being
equally
dense
for
as
far
as
we
can
seeit
is
as
if
they
are
all
contained
within
a
finite
sphere
or
a
sphere
with
fuzzy
edges
with
us
at
the
center
these
measurements
are
statistical
and
you
can
always
hide
a
sufficiently
small
number
of
a
different
type
of
grb
with
a
different
origin
in
the
data
i
am
assuming
that
there
is
only
one
population
of
grbs
the
data
indicates
that
we
are
less
than
of
the
radius
of
the
center
of
the
distribution
the
only
things
the
earth
is
at
the
exact
center
of
are
the
solar
system
at
the
scale
of
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
way
beyond
pluto
and
the
universe
cosmological
theories
placing
grbs
throughout
the
universe
require
supernovatype
energies
to
be
released
over
a
timescale
of
milliseconds
oort
cloud
models
tend
to
be
silly
even
by
the
standards
of
astrophysics
if
grbs
were
galactic
ie
distributed
through
the
milky
way
galaxy
you
would
expect
them
to
be
either
concentrated
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
for
a
disk
population
or
towards
the
galactic
center
for
a
spherical
halo
population
we
dont
see
this
so
if
they
are
galactic
they
must
be
in
a
halo
at
least
light
years
in
radius
and
we
would
probably
start
to
see
grbs
from
the
andromeda
galaxy
assuming
that
it
has
a
similar
halo
for
comparison
the
earth
is
lightyears
from
the
center
of
the
galaxy
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying

entering

the
arent
concentrated
in
the

spacelanes
and
we
dont

but
the
reason
i

is
that
most
everyone

well
lets
seei
took
a
class
on
this
last
fall
and
i
have
no
notes
so
ill
try
to
wing
it
heres
how
i
understand
it
remember
from
stellar
evolution
that
black
holes
and
neutron
starspulsars
are
formed
from
high
mass
stars
high
mass
stars
live
fast
and
burn
hard
taking
appoximately
years
before
going
nova
or
supernova
in
this
time
they
dont
live
long
enough
to
get
perturbed
out
of
the
galactic
plane
so
any
of
these
if
assumed
to
be
the
sources
of
grbs
will
be
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
then
we
take
the
catalog
of
bursts
that
have
been
recieved
from
the
various
satellites
around
the
solar
system
pioneer
venus
has
one
either
pion
or
ginga
and
of
course
batse
and
we
do
distribution
tests
on
our
catalog
these
tests
all
show
that
the
bursts
have
an
isotropic
distributionevenly
spread
out
in
a
radial
direction
and
they
show
signs
of
homogeneity
ie
they
do
not
clump
in
any
one
direction
so
unless
we
are
sampling
the
area
inside
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
we
are
sampling
the
universe
not
cool
if
you
want
to
figure
out
what
the
hell
caused
these
things
now
i
suppose
you
are
saying
well
we
stil
only
may
be
sampling
from
inside
the
disk
well
not
necessarily
remember
we
have
what
is
more
or
less
an
interplanetary
network
of
burst
detectors
with
a
baseline
that
goes
waaaay
out
to
beyond
plutopioneer
so
we
should
be
able
with
all
of
our
detectors
de
tect
some
sort
of
difference
in
angle
from
satellite
to
satellite
heres
an
analogy
you
see
a
plane
overhead
you
measure
the
angle
of
the
plane
from
the
origin
of
your
arbitrary
coordinate
system
one
of
your
friends
a
mile
away
sees
the
same
plane
and
measures
the
angle
from
the
zero
point
of
his
arbitrary
system
which
is
the
same
as
yours
the
two
angles
are
different
and
you
should
be
able
to
triangulate
the
position
of
your
burst
and
maybe
find
a
source
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
been
able
to
do
this
i
should
throw
in
why
halo
and
corona
models
dont
work
also
as
i
said
before
looking
at
the
possible
astrophysics
of
the
bursts
short
timescales
high
energy
black
holes
and
pulsars
exhibit
much
of
this
type
of
behavior
if
this
is
the
case
as
i
said
before
these
stars
seem
to
be
bound
to
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
especially
the
most
energetic
of
the
these
sources
when
you
look
at
a
simulated
model
where
the
bursts
are
confined
to
the
disk
but
you
sample
out
to
large
distances
say
mpc
you
should
definitely
see
not
only
an
anisotropy
towards
you
in
all
direction
but
a
clumping
of
sources
in
the
direction
of
the
galactic
center
as
i
said
before
there
is
none
of
these
characteristics
i
think
thats
all
of
itif
someone
needs
clarification

knows

not

can
substantially
influence
the

if

look

this

sector
should
retain
strong

as
us
firms
have
been
very
successful
in
regaining

furthermore

and
the
next
revision

then
i
expect
the

should
easily
top
m
if
the

are
added
back

and

projects
satellite

could

and
that
mobile

station
sales
are
expected
to
continue
to
growth
at
per

through
the
mid
my
numbers
are
somewhat
more
pessimistic
for
nearterm
market
growth
but
i
agree
the
trend
should
be
for
substantial
growth
in
us
commercial

sales
over
at
least
the
next

my
pessimism
is
due
to
more
conservative
assumptions
on
market
capture
and
growth
in
leo
communications
and

direct
broadcasting
services
i
dont
believe
all

current
players
in
the
yettobeborn

market
and
in
the
yettobeproven
direct

will

wins
two
key

mcdonnell
douglas
corporation
which
builds
and

the
delta
launch
vehicle
has
won
two
important
launch
contracts
motorola
inc
announced
in
mid
february
that
it
had
selected
the
delta
to
launch
most
of
the
satellites
in
the
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
and
in
mid
april
mcdonnell
douglas
was
awarded
the
usaf
medium
launch
vehicle
iii
contract
the
launch
services
contract
with
motorola
for
the
iridium
constellation
launch
is
for
at
launch
of
least
iridium
satellites
another
satellites
have
been
contracted
to
be
launched
by
khrunichev
enterprise
in
russian
on
proton
vehicle
launches
these
satellites
planned
for
the
delta
will
be
launched
at
a
time
providing
for
at
least
launches
additional
satellites
in
the
iridium
constellation
such
as
a
planned
onorbit
spares
may
also
be
launched
on
delta
although
details
of
the
launch
services
contract
were
reported
to
be
negotiation
and
not
yet
final
the
usaf
mlv
contract
also
went
to
mdc
bidding
a
variant
of
their
delta
ii
launcher
this
contract
is
only
initially
worth
million
but
establishes
a
set
of
launch
options
for
up
to
launches
encompassing
launches
from
through
these
launches
will
deploy
the
next
generation
of
the
usafs
global
positioning
system
block
iir
navigation
satellites
plus
other
programs
first
option
for
to
meet
the
usaf
launch
options
is
expected
to
be
exercised
this
year
after
which
the
usaf
is
expected
to
request
launches
of
up
to
deltas
per
year
for
at
least
years
under
this
contract
the
usaf
can
also
request
launch
on
demand
services
from
mdc
for
the
time
period
with
a
launch
to
occur
within
days
of
the
request
commentary
if
these
two
contracts
are
fulfilled
they
should
provide
an
excellent
business
base
for
mdcs
delta
launch
program
through
the
turn
of
the
century
combined
these
two
contracts
have
a
potential
for
about
launches
worth
about
m
to
mdc
and
sustaining
a
core
business
base
of
myear
other
contracts
for
international
and
commercial
payloads
as
well
as
for
nasa
medium
elvclass
payloads
will
add
to
this
business
base
keeping
mdc
as
a
viable
commerical
launch
company
however
it
should
be
noted
there
are
risk
elements
in
these
contracts
motorolas
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
has
not
yet
received
a
us
federal
communications
commission
license
for
operation
in
the
us
nor
has
motorola
lined
up
all
the
financing
and
financial
partners
for
the
iridium
venture
without
these
approvals
or
financial
backing
there
will
be
no
iridium
launches
but
hopefully
these
uncertainties
will
be
settled
this
year
similarly
the
usaf
mlv
iii
program
has
been
the
target
of
several
congressional
actions
which
have
slowed
the
production
of
the
gps
block
iir
satellites
and
deleted
the
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
program
in
favor
of
the
usaf
nlsspacelifter
program
at
this
time
while
it
appears
the
mlv
iii
contract
will
be
executed
future
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
and
other
usaf
commercial
launch
contracts
is
being
reconsidered
as
part
of
national
space
launch
strategy
reviews
some
opinions
expressed
from
within
the
administration
and
congress
propose
cancellation
of
all
elv
upgrade
programs
including
the
mlv
programs
in

proposed

such
opinions
may
have

other
than

this
was
reported
to
be

this
is

first
commercial

under
the

remote

act
the
act
as
passed
last
november
provides
that

may
be
sold
to

at
differing
prices
prior
to
this
act
remote
sensing
data
from
all
satellites
had
to
be
sold
to
all
users
at
the
same
prices
and
private
remote

ventures
would
have
had
to
sell
at

there
are
rumors
of
several
other
potential
commercial
remote

ventures
working
their
way
through
the
system
at
different
stages
of
development
i
think
the
large
landsat

spot
satellite
systems
will
provide
the
majority
of
the
satellite
remote

market
for
the
next
decade
or
so
in
contrast
to
these
large
governmentsponsored
remote
sensing
systems
smaller
market
ventures
such
as
worldview
and
others
can
exploit
market
niches
and
use
innovative
technology
and
i
believe
can
find
profitability
on
the
margin
i
predict
there
may
be
some
very
interesting

gds

some
potential

despite
current
problems
if
they
can
get
their
act
together
sales
are
projected
to
be
about

will
probably
generate
a
loss
of
about
m
if
gd
can
capture
their
projected
share
of
the
space
launch
market
and
if
they
have
managed
to
clean
up
the
reliability
of
their

then
they
could
generate
healthy
profits
from
those
sales
but
until
they
demonstrate
the

this

will
continue
to

substantial
losses
in

to

in
my
opinion
this
operation
is
not
a
really
good
candidate

quick
profitability
to
do
such
a

the
current

ariane
predicts
dip
in
launch
demand
arianespace
the
operator
of
the
ariane
launch
system
is
projecting
a
dip
in
launch
demand
in
the
late
in
early
february
arianespace
released
their
annual
market
survey
which
detailed
their
projection
of
the
space
transportation
market
for
the
next
decade
over
short
run
arianespace
expects
to
retain
their
dominant
position
and
sustain
a
majority
share
of
the
launch
market
of
international
and
commercial
launches

through
ariane

contracts
for
general
dynamics
atlas
vehicle
holds
contracts
mcdonnell

and

long
march
vehicle
holds
launch
contracts
threequarters
of
future
launch
contracts
for
which
ariane
can
compete
are
projected
to
come
from
communications
satellites
with
the
remaining
split
between
weather
earth
observation
and
scientific
satellites
most
of
the
future
telecommunications
demand
growth
is
predicted
to
come
from
the
asiapacific
region
arianespace
expects
the
current
market
consolidation
of
individual
satellite
operators
into
regional
or
national
groups
will
continue
with
these
groups
investing
in
heavier
satellites
with
larger
communications
payloads
carrying
more
transponders
arianespace
predicts
the
average
mass
of
telecommunications
satellites
should
increase
by
over
todays
average
level
to
about
kg
in
geo
demand
for
commercial
launch
services
is
expected
to
remain
strong
over
the
next
three
years
but
in
the
second
half
of
the
decade
arianespace
predicts
demand
will
decrease
arianespace
bases
this
prediction
upon
a
matching
of
satellite
transponder
demand
and
supply
particularly
as
new
data
compression
techniques
appear
to
could
double
or
triple
transponder
capacity
using
existing
or
nearterm
transponders
one
of
the
significant
possible
changes
in
the
market
was
identified
as
the
arrival
of
new
launch
vehicles
including
russian
launch
systems
but
arianespace
predicts
that
in
the
long
term
investors
purchasing
launch
services
are
looking
for
the
best
trade
off
between
launch
service
quality
and
price
and
that
russian
and
other
new
launch
services
will
have
to
prove
out
their
capabilities
and
service
quality
and
their
market
penetration
will
be
minimal
commentary
ariane
releases
their
market
surveys
annually
and
i
reported
on
their
prior
market
survey
in
a
past
issue
of
csnsti
comparing
the
two
surveys
there
arent
outstanding
differences
in
the
numbers
the
most
notable
change
is
the
consideration
of
new
data
compression
techniques
reducing
the
demand
for
new
physical
transponders
on
orbit
i
note
that
in
contrast
to
some
predictions
demand
for
space
based
communications
transponders
appears
to
be
remain
strong
while
fiber
optic
lines
are
making
substantial
inroads
into
the
established
pointtopoint
telecommunications
markets
growing
demand
for
telecommunications
services
world
wide
and
for
pointto
multipoint
broadcast
services
have
prevented
a
decrease
in
space
transponder
demand
fiberoptic
cables
provide
a
higher
capability
service
but
only
from
established
point
a
to
established
point
b
to
establish
a
fiberoptic
link
it
is
necessary
to
install
cable
between
the
points
and
while
there
are
improved
network
solutions
installing
a
large
network
of
distributed
fiberoptic
links
can
cost
millions
or
billions
of
dollars
for
broadcast
services
where
there
is
not
an
existing
ground
network
structure
satellites
still
offer
the
most
cost
effective
solution
and
if
new
services
are
required
into
a
new
region
it
is
cheaper
to
install
a
small
satellite
link
costing
only
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
tie
into
the
existing
global
satellite
network
this
allows
rapid
growth
of
new
satellite
services
and
has
kept
demand
high
the
replacement
market
for
fiberoptics
is
growing
as
well
since
as
demand
grows
between
the
points
serviced
it
becomes
cost
effective
to
later
install
a
fiberoptic
link
to
handle
the
increase
in
traffic
since
the
telecommunications
and
data
transfer
markets
are
still
growing
rapidly
satellite
market
projections
remain
rosy
but
satellites
are
also
getting
longer
orbital
lifetimes
current
generation
satellites
are
now
getting
guarantees
of
at
years
of
onorbit
service
or
more
in
contrast
to
years
of
service
from
last
generations
satellites
this
has
cut
back
some
of
the
launch
demand
as
satellite
owners
are
rescheduling
replacement
satellite
launches
over
longer
intervals
and
as
last
note
arianespace
didnt
flag
it
this
year
but
it
looks
like
the
space
transportation
market
will
be
rather
over
supplied
by
existing
launch
systems
in
the
near
term
the
annual
commercial
launch
demand
is
for
about
medium
sized
satellites
per
year
from
the
supply
side
ariane
is
capable
of
launching
up
to
about
a
dozen
medium
sized
satellites
a
year
delta
is
capable
of
about
per
year
atlas
is
capable
of
long
march
japans
hvehicle
russias
proton
capable
of
and
other
systems
such
as
zenit
and
soyuz
another
medium
launches
per
year
thats
a
lot
of
capability
for
a
small
market
we
can
only
expect
the
competition
to
intensify
for
commercial
launches
ntsb
investigates
pegasus
launch
over
aborted
abort
the
feb
pegasus
launch
by
orbital
sciences
corporation
has
spawned
an
investigation
over
an
apparent
violation
of
range
safety
rules
a
valid
abort
order
from
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
to
halt
the
mission
was
overridden
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
in
violation
of
range
safety
rules
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
pegasus
launch
countdown
one
of
two
abort
command
receivers
aboard
the
pegasus
failed
such
a
failure
typically
scrubs
a
launchand
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
at
wallops
island
va
issued
a
mission
abort
order
about
a
minute
before
the
scheduled
pegasus
launch
somehow
this
command
was
overridden
by
the
osc
launch
team
or
the
message
was
lost
in
the
communications
channels
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
despite
the
valid
abort
call
fortunately
the
pegasus
functioned
as
expected
and
the
abort
command
receiver
was
not
needed
but
this
incident
did
spark
an
investigation
since
a
valid
abort
order
was
given
under
agreedto
launch
constraint
rules
and
was
not
obeyed
leading
the
investigation
is
the
national
transportation
safety
board
ntsb
with
support
from
nasa
osc
and
the
air
force
this
investigation
marks
the
first
time
ntsb
has
taken
the
lead
on
an
incident
involving
a
space
launch
according
to
the
ntsb
their
investigation
will
take
about
months
and
is
primarily
looking
at
lines
of
authority
communications
links
and
safety
procedures
used
in
the
launch
commentary
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
ntsb
has
led
an
investigation
into
a
space
launch
their
leadership
was
requested
by
the
department
of
commerces
office
of
commercial
space
transportation
who
had
licensed
the
commercial
launch
at
the
time
of
writing
this
column
some
of
the
initial
investigations
have
been
concluded
and
some
of
the
results
are
starting
to
leak
out
into
the
trade
press
apparently
or
four
different
communications
channels
were
in
use
during
the
test
after
the
abort
destruct
receiver
stopped
responding
the
nasa
test
director
and
range
controller
in
the
mission
control
room
at
wallops
island
gave
abort
orders
about
a
minute
before
the
launch
according
to
the
mission
rules
this
should
have
stopped
the
launch
somehow
the
osc
test
conductor
ordered
the
abort
reversed
and
the
nasa
communicator
on
the
net
relayed
that
order
to
the
carrying
the
pegasus
at
about
seconds
before
launch
differing
explainations
of
exactly
how
this
happened
are
proposed
with
the
best
set
being
that
clear
lines
of
communications
and
clear
definition
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
mission
control
team
and
understanding
of
the
mission
rules
were
not
established
before
the
launch
as
we
see
more
and
more
commercial
launches
more
of
these
procedural
issues
are
going
to
crop
up
and
will
have
to
be
resolved
this
case
is
interesting
because
it
is
the
first
time
the
ntsb
has
been
called
in
to
investigate
a
commercial
launch
problem
as
they
do
with
commercial
aircraft
problems
i
think
this
problem
will
turn
out
to
be
primarily
problems
with
procedures
and
communications
and
will
be
cleared
up
with
issuance
of
guidelines
on
how
launch
communications
should
be
set
up
and
how
specific
lines
of
authority
should
be
delineated

commentary
theres
very
little
released
information
on

my
suspicion
is
it
is
another
russian
enterprise
looking
for
hard
currency
and
trying
to
capitalize
upon
their
inhouse
knowledge
of
exsoviet
launch

georgia
launch

dropped
from

georgia

institute
released
the
results
of
a
preliminary
study
on
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
rocket
launching
site
in
camden
county
georgia
at
the
old
kingsland
missile
test
launching
site
on
the
atlantic
coast
the
preliminary
study
recommended
the
site
not
be
pursued
as
a
commercial
launch
site
stating
reopening
the
site
was
not
feasible
due
to
projected
low
investment
returns
plus
environmental
and
other
geographic
considerations
however
the
report
did
say
the
site
might
be
ideal
for
other
aerospace
uses
and
recommended
other
potential
uses
commentary
this
should
put
the
nails
in
the
coffin
of
the
kingsland
commercial
launch
site
while
other
sites
are
still
proceeding
with
commercial
launch
site
development
plans
kingsland
found
without
a
key
customer
to
act
as
anchor
tenant
and
if
substantial
infrastructure
had
to
be
put
in
then
the
expected
returns
were
too
low
to
justify
the
cost
of
development
this
might
point
out
some
key
discriminators
in
judging
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
launch
site
these
include
is
there
an
identified
key
customer
to
provide
core
usage
sufficient
to
recover
setup
costs
is
there
a
market
advantage
of
using
the
site
can
existing
infrastructure
be
used
or
modified
at
the

can
financing
be
found
at
low
enough

those

have
to
also
be
judged
against
these
criteria
in
my
opinion
some
of
these

are
flying
on
hope
and
speculation

not
on

us
m
through
i
havent
been
able
to
establish
any
relationship
between
this
venture
and
those
of
the
nspot
but
there
might
be
a
connection
while
taiwan
has
the
financing
to
pursue
several
ventures
the
current
taiwanese
telecommunications
market
might
not
support
two
separate
sastellite
ventures
the
reported
name
for
the
tiawanesechinese
system
is
asiasat
but
i
dont
thinks
this
has
any
relationship
with
the
existing
hong
kongbased
asiasat
program
involving
chinese
hong
kong
and
other
asian
investors
other
than
using
it
as
an
organizational
model
there
are
some
obvious
advantages
to
pursuing
such
a
joing
venture
it
could
provide
excellent
firsthand
experience
to
taiwan
for
a
very
low
cost
which
then
can
be
used
in
later
satellite
ventures
but
there
are
internal
political
issues
between
taiwanese
and
chinese
ventures
but
putting
any
joint
venture
through
a
hong
kong
intermediary
corporation
might
allow
it
to
proceed
in
any
case
the
east
asian
satellite
market
is
lighting
up
with
substantially
growth

there

south

samsung

this
looks
like
a
very
aggressive
push
into

considering
that
east

is
currently
the
fastest
growing
sector
for

the

did
quite
a

better

the

of
two
developments
have
brought
these
type
of
activities
back
to
the
forefront
in
first
in
february
the

deployed
a

from
a
progress
vehicle
after
it
had
departed
from
the
mir
space
station
while
this
banner
reflector
was
blank
npo
energia
was
very
active
in
reporting
that
future
banner
reflectors
will
be
available
to
advertisers
who
could
use
a
space
based
video
of
their
logo
or
ad
printed
on
the
banner
in
a
tv
commercial
as
filmed
from
the
mir
the
second
development
has
been
that
space
marketing
inc
the
same
company
responsible
for
merchandising
space
on
the
conestoga
booster
and
comet
spacecraft
is
now
pushing
the
environmental
billboard
as
laid
out
by
smi
chief
engineer
dr
ron
humble
of
the
university
of
colorado
space
laboratory
and
preston
carter
of
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
the
environmental
billboard
is
a
large
inflatable
outer
support
structure
of
up
to
meters
advertising
is
carried
by
a
mylar
reflective
area
deployed
by
the
inflatable
frame
to
help
sell
the
concept
the
spacecraft
responsible
for
maintaining
the
billboard
on
orbit
will
carry
ozone
reading
sensors
to
continuously
monitor
the
condition
of
the
earths
delicate
protective
ozone
layer
according
to
mike
lawson
head
of
smi
furthermore
the
inflatable
billboard
has
reached
its
minimum
exposure
of
days
it
will
be
released
to
reenter
the
earths
atmosphere
according
to
imi
as
the
biodegradable
material
burns
it
will
release
ozonebuilding
components
that
will
literally
replenish
the
ozone
layer
the
remaining
spacecraft
will
monitor
the
atmosphere
for
another
year
before
it
too
reenters
and
burns
up
and
adds
to
the
ozone
supply
this
would
not
be
a
cheap
advertisement
costing
at
least
several
millions
of
dollars
exact
costs
were
not
available
but
smi
estimates
that
market
exposure
would
be
that
of
the
people
who
watched
the
superbowl
where
a
advertising
unit
cost
since
smi
is
located
in
atlanta
georgia
it
is
being
promoted
as
being
available
in
time
for
the
opening
of
the
summer
olympics
in
atlanta
but
back
to
brians
questions
and
does
anyone
have
any
more
details
other
than
what
was
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
serious
is
this
project
is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have
real
funding
see
above
as
for
serious
if
they
can
get
m
or
so
my
estimate
of
for
development
costs
and
a
flight
unit
plus
m
for
a
launch
then
its
probably
real
they
are
claiming
to
tailor
the
orbit
to
overfly
specific
locations
at
specific
times
for
optimum
advertising
impact
so
they
probably
cant
piggy
back
upon
someone
elses
planned
launch
and
will
have
to
buy
a
dedicated
launch
thats
a
m
cost
they
need
to
raise
right
there
and
there
will
probably
be
some
legal
challenges
to
this
as
well
note
there
is
one
potential
legal
challenge
to
smi
on
the
use
of
launch
vehicle
advertising
already
while
i
dont
think
the
legal
challenges
would
win
out
and
yes
i
am
an
amateur
astronomer
and
no
i
dont
really
like
the
idea
of
this
additional
light
pollution
but
i
know
of
no
prohibition
of
it
the
legal
challenges
and
court
fights
would
probably
remove
any
positive
aspects
of
the
advertising
i
can
imagine
several
ways
to
make
the
advertisers
look
like
louts
for
doing
this
which
would
change
positive
market
exposure
to
negative
market
exposure
and
negate
the
space
advertising
advantage
would
you
spend
m
to
look
like
an
idiot
and
light
pollution
might
not
be
too
bad
if
its
in
a
low
enough
orbit
and
it
relies
upon
reflected
light
only
it
would
only
be
visible
for
a
short
time
just
after
local
dusk
and
before
dawn
for
maximum
market
exposure
you
want
to
have
it
visible
just
after
dusk
minimizing
impact
on
astronomy
since
thats
the
time
of
worse
seeing
due
to
daynight
thermal
turbulence
it
might
still
be
a
problem
but
perhaps
there
are
ways
to
mitigate
this
as
for
having
real
funding
none
that
i
can
identify
there
were
about
expressions
of
interest
made
on
the
conestoga
advertising
opportunity
but
that
included
curious
folks
and
was
for
only
a
commitment
i
havent
heard
of
any
serious
funding
for
this
but
im
sure
they
are
shopping
the
venture
around
looking
for
some
money
in
order
to
flesh
out
the
concept
some
more
but
i
am
confident
there
are
no
firm
or
paying
customers
at
this
time
and
if
anybody
wants
to
crosspost
this
to
sciastro
please
be
my
guest
i
dont
have
posting
privileges
to
that
area
or
at
least
i
dont
think
i

how

well
i
had
been
collecting
data
for
next
edition
of
the
commercial
space
newsspace
technology
investor
to
summarize
space
advertising
first
advertising
on
space
vehicles
is
not
new
it
is
very
common
practice
to
put
the
cooperating
organizations
logos
on
the
space
launch
vehicle
for
example
the
latest
gps
launcher
had
the
very
prominent
logos
on
its
side
of
mcdonnell
douglas
the
delta
launcher
rockwell
international
who
built
the
gps
satellite
usaf
who
paid
for
the
satellite
and
launch
and
the
gpsnavstar
program
office
this
has
not
been
considered
paid
advertising
but
rather
public
relations
since
the
restrictions
have
been
such
that
only
organizations
involved
in
the
launch
could
put
their
logos
on
the
side
and
there
was
no
money
exchanged
for
this
however
putting
a
high
logo
on
the
side
of
the
launch
vehicle
facing
the
cameras
is
advertising
as
much
as
it
is
public
relations
in
my
opinion
and
by
the
way
i
note
that
the
dcx
test
vehicle
has
rather
prominent
mcdonnelldouglas
and
sdio
logos
on
the
side
there
have
been
several
studies
looking
at
the
revenue
potentials
for
use
of
space
vehicles
for
advertising
or
placing
large
advertising
signs
in
orbit
on
the
shuttle
for
example
i
know
of
several
serious
studies
in
the
early
and
mid
which
looked
at
putting
logos
on
the
external
tank
or
on
the
sides
of
the
payload
bay
these
ventures
would
be
different
than
public
relations
in
that
the
logos
or
displays
would
not
be
restricted
to
the
firms
participating
on
that
flight
and
would
involve
payment
of
sums
for
the
right
to
fly
the
logos
in
a
prominent
organization
for
example
painting
the
et
to
look
like
a
pepsi
can
or
putting
a
disneyworld
logo
on
the
inside
of
the
payload
bay
where
the
cameras
would
scan
past
it
adverts
on
launch
vehicles
the
first
paid
advertising
was
done
on
a
soviet
launcher
in
about
when
several
noninvolved
foreign
organizations
were
allowed
to
pay
to
put
their
logos
on
a
proton
launch
an
italian
shoe
company
was
one
of
the
first
advertisers
i
remember
similarly
soviet
cosmonauts
on
mir
made
a
paid
advertisement
for
the
last
olympic
games
and
have
gleefully
shown
banners
and
other
items
from
participating
firms
and
organizations
mars
candy
bars
for
example
got
a
plug
from
orbit
as
a
sponsor
of
the
launch
of
the
british
visiting
cosmonaut
to
mir
now
us
firms
are
starting
to
put
paid
advertisements
on
launch
vehicles
the
upcoming
conestoga
launch
in
june
putting
the
comet
recoverable
payload
capsule
into
orbit
will
have
paid
advertisements
on
the
side
for
arnold
schwarzeneggers
upcoming
movie
the
last
action
hero
besides
the
usual
logos
of
the
participating
organizations
columbia
pictures
has
paid
to
put
ads
on
the
main
fuselage
of
the
missions
conestoga
rocket
its
booster
rockets
and
on
the
comet
payload
which
will
orbit
the
earth
for
one
month
a
concept
for
this
advertising
display
was
published
in
space
news
magazine
a
couple
of
months
ago
as
a
side
note
robert
lorsch
an
advertising
executive
is
talking
about
suing
nasa
he
charges
nasa
with
appropriating
an
idea
he
created
with
the
space
agency
in
to
form
corporate
advertising
sponsorships
on
nasa
spacecraft
as
a
way
to
get
funding
for
the
space
program
lorsch
contends
that
in
selling
advertising
space
on
the
upcoming
comet
nasa
violated
an
agreement
that
it
would
not
use
his
idea
without
him
being
the
exclusive
representative
for
nasa
and
receiving
compensation
this
is
being
disputed
since
the
launch
is
a
commercial
launch
and
nasa
is
receiving
none
of
the
advertising
revenues
but
the
funding
for
the
comet
program
is
coming
from

in

prbaccessdigexcom
pat
writes
what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
their
distribution
is
very
isotropic
and
the
intensity
distribution
crudely
speaking
indicates
were
seeing
an
edge
to
the
distribution
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
now
in
the
good
old
days
before
gro
data
it
was
thought
the
gamma
bursters
were
neutron
stars
in
the
galaxy
it
was
expected
that
gro
would
confirm
this
by
either
showing
they
were
a
local
population
within
a
few
hundred
light
years
or
that
they
were
in
the
galactic
halo
mechanism
was
not
known
but
several
plausible
ones
existed
also
to
be
fair
it
was
noted
that
the
brightest
burster
was
probably
in
the
lmc
suggesting
theorists
might
be
wrong
back
then
as
the
sun
is
not
at
the
center
of
the
galaxy
a
halo
population
should
show
anisotropy
a
local
disk
population
is
ruled
out
completely
at
this
stage
to
avoid
the
anisotropy
you
have
to
push
the
halo
out
the
energy
then
gets
large
the
mechanism
of
getting
ns
out
that
far
becomes
questionable
and
we
should
start
to
see
for
example
the
andromedas
bursters
the
data
is
consistent
with
either
a
oort
cloud
distribution
but
only
just
but
no
one
can
think
of
a
plausible
source
with
the
right
spectrum
or
it
can
be
a
cosmological
distances
hence
isotropy
and
the
edge
is
the
edge
of
the
universe
if
at
cosmological
distances
you
need
very
high
energy
to
detect
and
a
very
compact
source
for
spectrum
ergo
a
neutron
star
colliding
with
another
neutron
star
or
black
hole
even
then
getting
the
spectrum
is
very
hard
but
conceivable
if
we
know
anything
about
physics
at
that
level
the
bursters
are
not
due
to
quantum
black
holes
or
cosmic
strings
wrong
spectrum
for
one
thing
the
situation
is
further
complicated
by
recent
claims
that
there
are
two
classes
of
sources
in
the
colliding
ns
theyd
actually
probably
fit
relatively
easily
into
the
nsns
and
nsbh
collision
scenarios
respectively
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying
saucers
entering
hyperspace
but
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
that
most
everyone
assumes
that
they
are
colliding
nuetron
stars
or
spinning
black
holes
i
just
wondered
if
any

could
exist

the

sept
the

was
in
three
sections
separated
by

the

section
housed
the

disturbance
compensation
system
which
consisted
of
a

of

housed
within
a

the

flew

free
from

teflon
microthrusters
kept
the

of

larsonian
astronomy
and
physics
orthodox
physicists
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
in
which
all
of
the
forces
of
the
universe
can
be
explained
with
a
single
set
of
laws
or
equations
but
they
have
been
systematically
ignoring
or
suppressing
an
excellent
one
for
years
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
which
he
calls
the
reciprocal
system
is
built
on
two
fundamental
postulates
about
the
physical
and
mathematical
natures
of
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
in
two
reciprocal
forms
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
developed
a
complete
theoretical
universe
using
various
combinations
of
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
vibrational
rotational
motions
the
concepts
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
and
speeds
in
relation
to
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
called
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
at
each
step
in
the
development
larson
was
able
to
match
objects
in
his
theoretical
universe
with
objects
in
the
real
physical

etc
even

discovered
then
such
as
exploding
galaxies
and
gammaray

and
applying
his
theory
to
his
new
model
of
the
atom
larson
was
able
to
precisely
and
accurately
calculate
inter
atomic
distances
in
crystals
and
molecules
compressibility
and
thermal
expansion
of
solids
and
other
properties
of

of
this
is

physicist

b
larsons
background
physicist
dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
chemical
or
electrical
he
was
about
years
old
when
he
died
in
may
he
had
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
while
trying
to
develop
a
way
to
compute
chemical
properties
based
only
on
the
elements
used
larsons
lack
of
a
fancy
phd
degree
might
be
one
reason
that
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
him
but
it
is
not
a
valid
reason
sometimes
it
takes
a
relative
outsider
to
clearly
see
the
forest
through
the
trees
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
from
his
books
that
he
also
knew
orthodox
physics
and
astronomy
as
well
as
any
physicist
or
astronomer
well
enough
to
point
out
all
their
contradictions
ad
hoc
assumptions
principles
of
impotence
inconsistencies
etc
larson
did
not
have
the
funds
etc
to
experimentally
test
his
theory
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
him
to
do
so
he
simply
compared
the
various
parts
of
his
theory
with
other
researchers
experimental
and
observational
data
and
in
many
cases
his
explanation
fit
better
a
selfconsistent
theory
is
much
more
than
the
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
have
they
claim
to
be
looking
for
a
unified
field
theory
that
works
but
have
been
ignoring
one
for
over
years
now
modern
physics
does
not
explain
the
physical
universe
so
well
some
parts
of
some
of
larsons
books
are
full
of
quotations
of
leading
orthodox
physicists
and
astronomers
who
agree
and
remember
that
epicycles
crystal
spheres
geocentricity
flat
earth
theory
etc
also
once
seemed
to
explain
it
well
but
were
later
proved
conceptually
wrong

super
collider
boondoggle
i
am
against
contruction
of
the
superconducting
super
collider
in
texas
or
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
gross
waste
of
money
and
contribute
almost
nothing
of
scientific
value
most
physicists
dont
realize
it
but
according
to
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
as
described
in
his
books
the
strange
goofy
particles
mesons
hyperons
alleged
quarks
etc
which
they
are
finding
in
existing
colliders
fermi
lab
cern
etc
are
really
just
atoms
of
antimatter
which
are
created
by
the
highenergy
colliding
beams
and
which
quickly
disintegrate
like
cosmic
rays
because
they
are
incompatible
with
their
environment
a
larger
and
more
expensive
collider
will
only
create
a
few
more
elements
of
antimatter
that
the
physicists
have
not
seen
there
before
and
the
physicists
will
be
even
more
confused
than
they
are
now
are
a
few
more
types
of
antimatter
atoms
worth
the
billion
cost
dont
we
have
much
more
important
uses
for
this
wasted
money
another
thing
to
consider
is
that
the
primary
proposed
location
in
texas
has
a
serious
and
growing
problem
with
some
kind
of
fire
ants
eating
the
insulation
off
underground
cables
how
much
poisoning
of
the
ground
and
ground
water
with
insecticides
will
be
required
to
keep
the
ants
out
of
the
supercollider
naming
the
super
collider
after
ronald
reagon
as
proposed
is
totally
absurd
if
it
is
built
it
should
be
named
after
a
leading
particle
physicist
larsonian
antimatter
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
antimatter
is
not
a
simple
case
of
opposite
charges
of
the
same
types
of
particles
it
has
more
to
do
with
the
rates
of
vibrations
and
rotations
of
the
photons
of
which
they
are
made
in
relation
to
the
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
of
the
speed
of
light
which
larson
calls
unit
velocity
and
the
natural
datum
in
larsons
theory
a
positron
is
actually
a
particle
of
matter
not
antimatter
when
a
positron
and
electron
meet
the
rotational
vibrations
charges
and
rotations
of
their
respective
photons
of
which
they
are
made
neutralize
each
other
in
larsons
theory
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
has
three
dimensions
of
time
and
only
one
dimension
of
space
and
exists
in
a
reciprocal
relationship
to
our
material
half
larsonian
relativity
the
perihelion
point
in
the
orbit
of
the
planet
mercury
has
been
observed
and
precisely
measured
to
advance
at
the
rate
of
seconds
of
arc
per
century
seconds
of
this
advance
are
attributed
via
calculations
to
gravitational
perturbations
from
the
other
planets
venus
earth
jupiter
etc
the
remaining
seconds
of
arc
are
being
used
to
help
prove
einsteins
general
theory
of
relativity
but
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
achieved
results
closer
to
the
seconds
than
general
relativity
can
by
instead
using
special
relativity
in
one
or
more
of
his
books
he
applied
the
lorentz
transformation
on
the
high
orbital
speed
of
mercury
larson
totally
rejected
general
relativity
as
another
mathematical
fantasy
he
also
rejected
most
of
special
relativity
including
the
parts
about
mass
increases
near
the
speed
of
light
and
the
use
of
the
lorentz
transform
on
doppler
shifts
those
quasars
with
redshifts
greater
than
really
are
moving
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
motion
is
away
from
us
in
time
in
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
there
are
three
dimensions
of
time
instead
of
only
one
but
two
of
those
dimensions
can
not
be
measured
from
our
material
half
of
the
physical
universe
the
one
dimension
that
we
can
measure
is
the
clock
time
at
low
relative
speeds
the
values
of
the
other
two
dimensions
are
negligible
but
at
high
speeds
they
become
significant
and
the
lorentz
transformation
must
be
used
as
a
fudge
factor
larson
often
used
the
term
coordinate
time
when
writing
about
this
in
regard
to
mass
increases
it
has
been
proven
in
atomic
accelerators
that
acceleration
drops
toward
zero
near
the
speed
of
light
but
the
formula
for
acceleration
is
acceleration
force
mass
a
fm
orthodox
physicists
are
ignoring
the
third
factor
force
in
larsons
theory
mass
stays
constant
and
force
drops
toward
zero
force
is
actually
a
motion
or
combinations
of
motions
or
relations
between
motions
including
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
the
expansion
of
the
universe
for
example
is
an
outward
scalar
motion
inherent
in
the
universe
and
not
a
result
of
the
socalled
big
bang
which
is
yet
another
mathematical
fantasy
the
universe
of
motion
i
wish
to
recommend
to
everyone
the
book
the
universe
of
motion
by
dewey
b
larson
north
pacific
publishers
po
box
portland
oregon
pages
indexed
hardcover
it
contains
the
astrophysical
portions
of
a
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
that
author
an
unrecognized
genius
more
than
thirty
years
ago
it
contains
final
solutions
to
most
all
astrophysical
mysteries
including
the
formation
of
galaxies
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
the
true
origin
of
the
background
radiation
cosmic
rays
and
gamma
ray
bursts
and
the
true
nature
of
quasars
pulsars
white
dwarfs
exploding
galaxies
etc
it
contains
what
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
are
all
looking
for
if
they
are
ready
to
seriously
consider
it
with
open
minds
the
following
is
an
example
of
his
theorys
success
in
his
first
book
in
the
structure
of
the
physical
universe
larson
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
larsons
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
an
immediate
related
explanation
for
them
also
gammaray
bursts
astrophysicists
and
astronomers
are
still
scratching
their
heads
about
the
mysterious
gammaray
bursts
they
were
originally
thought
to
originate
from
neutron
stars
in
the
disc
of
our
galaxy
but
the
new
gamma
ray
telescope
now
in
earth
orbit
has
been
detecting
them
in
all
directions
uniformly
and
their
source
locations
in
space
do
not
correspond
to
any
known
objects
except
for
a
few
cases
of
directional
coincidence
gammaray
bursts
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
according
to
page
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
published
in
the
gammaray
bursts
are
coming
from
supernova
explosions
in
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
which
larson
calls
the
cosmic
sector
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
antimatter
and
material
halves
of
the
physical
universe
and
the
way
they
are
connected
together
the
gammaray
bursts
can
pop
into
our
material
half
anywhere
in
space
seemingly
at
random
this
is
why
the
source
locations
of
the
bursts
do
not
correspond
with
known
objects
and
come
from
all
directions
uniformly
i
wonder
how
close
to
us
in
space
a
source
location
would
have
to
be
for
a
gammaray
burst
to
kill
all
or
most
life
on
earth
there
would
be
no
way
to
predict
one
nor
to
stop
it
perhaps
some
of
the
mass
extinctions
of
the
past
which
are
now
being
blamed
on
impacts
of
comets
and
asteroids
were
actually
caused
by
nearby
gammaray
bursts
larsonian
binary
star
formation
about
half
of
all
the
stars
in
the
galaxy
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sun
are
binary
or
double
but
orthodox
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
still
have
no
satisfactory
theory
about
how
they
form
or
why
there
are
so
many
of
them
but
binary
star
systems
are
actually
a
likely
consequence
of
the
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
developed
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
i
will
try
to
summarize
larsons
explanation
which
is
detailed
in
chapter
of
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
and
in
some
of
his
other
books
first
of
all
according
to
larson
stars
do
not
generate
energy
by
fusion
a
small
fraction
comes
from
slow
gravitational
collapse
the
rest
results
from
the
complete
annihilation
of
heavy
elements
heavier
than
iron
each
element
has
a
destructive
temperature
limit
the
heavier
the
element
is
the
lower
is
this
limit
a
stars
internal
temperature
increases
as
it
grows
in
mass
via
accretion
and
absorption
of
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
gradually
reaching
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
lighter
and
lighter
elements
when
the
internal
temperature
of
the
star
reaches
the
destructive
temperature
limit
of
iron
there
is
a
type
i
supernova
explosion
this
is
because
there
is
so
much
iron
present
and
that
is
related
to
the
structure
of
iron
atoms
and
the
atom
building
process
which
larson
explains
in
some
of
his
books
better
than
i
can
when
the
star
explodes
the
lighter
material
on
the
outer
portion
of
the
star
is
blown
outward
in
space
at
less
than
the
speed
of
light
the
heavier
material
in
the
center
portion
of
the
star
was
already
bouncing
around
at
close
to
the
speed
of
light
because
of
the
high
temperature
the
explosion
pushes
that
material
over
the
speed
of
light
and
it
expands
outward
in
time
which
is
equivalent
to
inward
in
space
and
it
often
actually
disappears
for
a
while
over
long
periods
of
time
both
masses
start
to
fall
back
gravitationally
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
space
now
starts
to
form
a
red
giant
star
the
material
that
had
been
blown
outward
in
time
starts
to
form
a
white
dwarf
star
both
stars
then
start
moving
back
toward
the
main
sequence
from
opposite
directions
on
the
hr
diagram
the
chances
of
the
two
masses
falling
back
into
the
exact
same
location
in
space
making
a
single
lone
star
again
are
near
zero
they
will
instead
form
a
binary
system
orbiting
each
other
according
to
larson
a
white
dwarf
star
has
an
inverse
density
gradient
is
densest
at
its
surface
because
the
material
at
its
center
is
most
widely
dispersed
blown
outward
in
time
this
eliminates
the
need
to
resort
to
mathematical
fantasies
about
degenerate
matter
neutron
stars
black
holes
etc
larsonian
solar
system
formation
if
the
mass
of
the
heavy
material
at
the
center
of
the
exploding
star
is
relatively
small
then
instead
of
a
single
white
dwarf
star
there
will
be
several
mini
white
dwarf
stars
revolving
around
the
red
giant
star
but
probably
still
too
far
away
in
threedimensional
time
to
be
affected
by
its
heat
etc
these
will
become
planets
in
chapter
of
the
universe
of
motion
larson
used
all
this
information
and
other
principles
of
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
to
derive
his
own
version
of
bodes
law
black
hole
fantasy
i
heard
that
physicist
stephen
w
hawking
recently
completed
a
theoretical
mathematical
analysis
of
two
black
holes
merging
together
into
a
single
black
hole
and
concluded
that
the
new
black
hole
would
have
more
mass
than
the
sum
of
the
two
original
black
holes
such
a
result
should
be
recognized
by
everyone
as
a
red
flag
causing
widespread
doubt
about
the
whole
idea
of
black
holes
etc
after
reading
physicist
dewey
b
larsons
books
about
his
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
especially
his
book
the
universe
of
motion
it
is
clear
to
me
that
black
holes
are
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
the
strange
object
at
cygnus
is
just
an
unusually
massive
white
dwarf
star
not
the
black
hole
that
orthodox
astronomers
and
physicists
so
badly
want
to
prove
their
theory
by
the
way
i
do
not
understand
why
so
much
publicity
is
being
given
to
physicist
stephen
hawking
the
physicists
and
astronomers
seem
to
be
acting
as
if
hawkings
severe
physical
problem
somehow
makes
him
wiser
it
does
not
i
wish
the
same
attention
had
been
given
to
physicist
dewey
b
larson
while
he
was
still
alive
widespread
publicity
and
attention
should
now
be
given
to
larsons
theory
books
and
organization
the
international
society
of
unified
science
electromagnetic
propulsion
i
heard
of
that
concept
many
years
ago
in
connection
with
ufos
and
unorthodox
inventors
but
i
never
was
able
to
find
out
how
or
why
they
work
or
how
they
are
constructed
i
found
a
possible
clue
about
why
they
might
work
on
pages
of
the
book
basic
properties
of
matter
by
the
late
physicist
dewey
b
larson
which
describes
part
of
larsons
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
i
quote
one
paragraph
as
indicated
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
universe
of
motion
arrives
at
a
totally
different
concept
of
the
nature
of
electrical
resistance
the
electrons
we
find
are
derived
from
the
environment
it
was
brought
out
in
volume
i
larsons
book
nothing
but
motion
that
there
are
physical
processes
in
operation
which
produce
electrons
in
substantial
quantities
and
that
although
the
motions
that
constitute
these
electrons
are
in
many
cases
absorbed
by
atomic
structures
the
opportunities
for
utilizing
this
type
of
motion
in
such
structures
are
limited
it
follows
that
there
is
always
a
large
excess
of
free
electrons
in
the
material
sector
material
half
of
the
universe
most
of
which
are
uncharged
in
this
uncharged
state
the
electrons
cannot
move
with
respect
to
extension
space
because
they
are
inherently
rotating
units
of
space
and
the
relation
of
space
to
space
is
not
motion
in
open
space
therefore
each
uncharged
electron
remains
permanently
in
the
same
location
with
respect
to
the
natural
reference
system
in
the
manner
of
a
photon
in
the
context
of
the
stationary
spatial
reference
system
the
uncharged
electron
like
the
photon
is
carried
outward
at
the
speed
of
light
by
the
progression
of
the
natural
reference
system
all
material
aggregates
are
thus
exposed
to
a
flux
of
electrons
similar
to
the
continual
bombardment
by
photons
of
radiation
meanwhile
there
are
other
processes
to
be
discussed
later
whereby
electrons
are
returned
to
the
environment
the
electron
population
of
a
material
aggregate
such
as
the
earth
therefore
stabilizes
at
an
equilibrium
level
note
that
in
larsons
theory
uncharged
electrons
are
also
massless
and
are
basically
photons
of
light
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
spinning
around
one
axis
at
a
particular
rate
below
the
unit
rate
unit
velocity
is
the
speed
of
light
and
there
are
vibrational
and
rotational
equivalents
to
the
speed
of
light
according
to
larsons
theory
i
might
have
the
above
and
below
labels
mixed
up
larson
is
saying
that
outer
space
is
filled
with
mass
less
uncharged
electrons
flying
around
at
the
speed
of
light
if
this
is
true
then
the
electromagnetic
propulsion
fields
of
spacecraft
might
be
able
to
interact
with
these
electrons
or
other
particles
in
space
perhaps
giving
them
a
charge
and
mass
and
shooting
them
toward
the
rear
to
achieve
propulsion
in
larsons
theory
an
electrical
charge
is
a
onedimensional
rotational
vibration
of
a
particular
frequency
above
the
unit
frequency
superimposed
on
the
rotation
of
the
particle
the
paragraph
quoted
above
might
also
give
a
clue
to
confused
meteorologists
about
how
and
why

on

and
two
of
the
soviet
unions
mighty
proton
rockets
lifted
off
from
the
tyuratam
space
center
in
the
kazakhstan
republic
aboard
those
boosters
were
a
new
breed
of
venera
probe
for
the
planet
venus
designated
venera
and
the
probes
were
meant
not
for
landing
yet
more
spherical
craft
on
the
venerean
surface
but
to
radar
map
the
planet
in
detail
from
orbit
to
accomplish
this
task
the
basic
venera
design
was
modified
in
numerous
areas
the
central
bus
core
was
made
one
meter
inches
longer
to
carry
the
two
tons
of
propellant
required
for
braking
into
orbit
double
the
fuel
carried
by
the
venera
and
orbiters
eight
years
earlier
extra
solar
panels
were
added
on
to
give
the
vehicles
more
power
for
handling
the
large
amounts
of
data
which
would
be
created
by
the
radar
imaging
the
dishshaped
communications
antennae
were
also
made
one
meter
larger
to
properly
transmit
this
information
to
earth
atop
the
buses
where
landers
were
usually
placed
were
installed
the
by
by
polyus
v
sidelooking
radar
antennae
the
radar
system
possibly
a
terrainimaging
version
of
the
nuclearpowered
satellites
used
by
the
soviets
for
earth
ocean
surveillance
would
be
able
to
map
venus
surface
at
a
resolution
of
one
to
two
kilometers
to
miles
the
soviet
probes
imaging
parameters
were
a
vast
improvement
over
the
united
states
pioneer
venus
orbiter
which
could
reveal
objects
no
smaller
than
kilometers
miles
in
diameter
and
while
the
veneras
resolution
was
comparable
to
that
of
similar
observations
made
by
the
arecibo
radio
telescope
on
the
island
of
puerto
rico
the
orbiters
would
be
examining
the
northern
pole
of
venus
this
region
was
unobtainable
by
either
arecibo
or
pioneer
venus
and
appeared
to
contain
a
number
of
potentially
interesting
geological
features
worthy
of
investigation
on
october
after
an
interplanetary
journey
of
million
kilometers
million
miles
and
two
midcourse
corrections
venera
fired
its
braking
rockets
over
venus
to
place
itself
in
a
polar
orbit
by
kilometers
by
miles
around
the
planet
completing
one
revolution
every
twentyfour
hours
venera
followed
suit
four
days
later
the
twin
probes
thus
became
venus
first
polarcircling
spacecraft
radar
operations
began
on
october
for
venera
and
october
for
venera
for
up
to
sixteen
minutes
every
orbit
over
the
north
pole
the
probes
would
make
a
radar
sweep
of
the
surface
kilometers
ninety
miles
wide
and
nine
thousand
kilometers
miles
long
the
craft
would
then
head
out
to
the
highest
part
of
their
orbits
over
the
south
pole
to
recharge
their
batteries
and
transmit
the
data
back
to
two
large
soviet
antennae
on
earth
each
strip
of
information
took
eight
hours
to
process
by
computer
by
the
end
of
their
main
missions
in
july
of
the
veneras
had
mapped
million
square
kilometers
million
square
miles
thirty
percent
of
the
entire
planet
venera
and
revealed
that
venus
has
a
surface
geology
more
complex
than
shown
by
pioneer
venus
in
the
late
numerous
hills
mountains
ridges
valleys
and
plains
spread
across
the
landscape
many
of
them
apparently
formed
by
lava
from
erupting
volcanoes
in
the
last
one
billion
years
in
planetary
terms
this
makes
the
venerean
surface
rather
young
hundreds
of
craters
were
detected
as
well
the
largest
of
which
had
to
have
been
created
by
meteorites
planetoids
would
be
a
better
term
here
at
least
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
due
to
venus
very
dense
atmosphere
there
were
some
disagreements
between
us
and
soviet
scientists
on
the
origins
of
certain
surface
features
for
example
the
probes
owners
declared
that
the
wide
crater
at
the
summit
of
high
maxwell
montes
the
tallest
mountain
on
the
planet
was
the
result
of
a
meteorite
impact
american
scientists
on
the
other
hand
felt
the
crater
was
proof
that
maxwell
was
a
huge
volcano
sitting
on
the
northern
continent
of
ishtar
terra
in
any
event
the
us
decided
to
wait
on
making
verdicts
about
venus
until
the
arrival
of
their
own
radar
probe
scheduled
for
later
in
the
decade
originally
named
the
venus
orbiting
imaging
radar
voir
its
initial
design
was
scaled
back
and
the
craft
was
redesig
nated
the
venus
radar
mapper
vrm
eventually
the
machine
would
be
called
magellan
after
the
portuguese
navigator
ferdinand
magellan
circa
this
vehicle
would
map
the
entire
planet
in
even
finer
detail
than
the
veneras
for
the
time
however
the
soviet
probes
maintained
that
distinction
radar
imaging
was
not
the
only
ability
of
the
veneras
bolted
next
to
the
polyus
v
radar
antenna
were
the
omega
altimeter
and
the
fourier
infrared
spectrometer
the
latter
for
measuring
the
worlds
temperatures
the
majority
of
the
areas
covered
registered
about
five
hundred
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
but
a
few
locations
were
two
hundred
degrees
hotter
possibly
indicating
current
volcanic
activity
the
probes
also
found
that
the
clouds
over
the
poles
were
five
to
eight
kilometers
three
to
miles
lower
than
at
the
equator
in
contrast
the
polar
air
above
sixty
kilometers
thirtysix
miles
altitude
was
five
to
twenty
degrees
warmer
than
the
equatorial
atmosphere
at
similar
heights
when
the
main
mapping
mission
ended
in
july
of
there
were
plans
for
at
least
one
of
the
veneras
to
radar
image
the
surface
at
more
southernly
latitudes
unfortunately
this
idea
did
not
come
to
pass
as
the
orbiters
may
not
have
possessed
enough
attitudecontrol
gas
to
perform
the
operation
venera
and
ceased
transmission
in
march
of
leaving
the
soviet
institute
of
radiotechnology
and
electronics
with
six
hundred
kilometers
miles
of
radar
data
tape
to
sort
into
an
atlas
of
twentyseven
maps
of
the
northern
hemisphere
of
venus
venus
by
balloon
for
years
the
thick
atmosphere
of
venus
had
been
a
tempting
target
to
scientists
who
wished
to
explore
the
planets
mantle
of
air
with
balloonborne
instruments
professor
jacques
blamont
of
the
french
space
agency
centre
national
detudes
spatiales
cnes
had
proposed
such
an
idea
as
far
back
as
only
to
have
a
joint
frenchsoviet
balloon
mission
canceled
in
nevertheless
late
in
the
year
such
dreams
would
eventually
come
true
when
two
proton
rockets
were
sent
skyward
on
december
and
the
soviet
union
provided
western
observers
with
the
first
clear
full
views
of
the
booster
which
had
been
launching
every
soviet
venus
probe
since
this
was
but
one
of
many
firsts
for
the
complex
mission
the
unmanned
probes
launched
into
space
that
december
were
named
vega
and
a
contraction
of
the
words
venera
and
gallei
gallei
being
the
russian
word
for
halley
not
only
did
the
spacecraft
have
more
than
one
mission
to
perform
they
also
had
more
than
one
celestial
objective
to
explore
namely
the
comet
halley
this
famous
periodic
traveler
was
making
its
latest
return
to
the
inner
regions
of
the
solar
system
since
its
last
visit
in
since
it
was
widely
believed
that
comets
are
the
icy
remains
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
five
billion
years
ago
scientists
around
the
world
gave
high
priority
to
exploring
one
of
the
few
such
bodies
which
actually
come
close
to
earth
most
comets
linger
in
the
cold
and
dark
outer
fringes
of
the
solar
system
some
like
halley
are
perturbed
by
various
forces
and
fall
in
towards
the
sun
where
they
circle
for
millennia
spewing
out
ice
and
debris
for
millions
of
kilometers
from
the
warmth
of
each
solar
encounter
the
soviet
union
along
with
the
european
space
agency
esa
and
japans
institute
of
space
and
astronautical
science
isas
did
not
wish
to
miss
out
on
this
first
opportunity
in
human
history
to
make
a
close
examination
of
halley
the
esa
would
be
using
the
cylindrical
giotto
probe
to
make
a
dangerously
close
photographic
flyby
of
the
comet
while
japans
first
deep
space
craft
sakigake
pioneer
and
suisei
comet
would
view
halley
from
a
much
safer
distance
scientists
in
the
united
states
also
desired
to
study
the
comet
from
the
vantage
of
a
space
probe
at
one
time
envisioning
a
vessel
powered
by
solar
sails
or
ion
engines
however
government
budget
cuts
to
nasa
canceled
the
american
efforts
the
us
would
have
to
make
do
primarily
with
earthbased
observations
and
the
sharing
of
data
from
other
nations
though
an
instrument
named
the
dust
counter
and
mass
analyzer
ducma
designed
by
chicago
university
professor
john
simpson
was
added
on
the
soviet
mission
in
may
of
the
soviets
answer
to
halley
were
the
vegas
instead
of
building
an
entirely
new
craft
for
the
mission
the
soviets
decided
to
modify
their
venera
bus
design
to
encounter
the
comet
while
performing
an
advanced
venus
mission
along
the
way
as
vega
and
reached
venus
the
buses
would
drop
off
one
landerballoon
each
and
use
the
mass
of
the
shrouded
planet
to
swing
them
towards
comet
halley
much
as
the
us
probe
mariner
used
venus
to
flyby
mercury
eleven
years
earlier
the
soviet
craft
would
then
head
on
to
halley
helping
to
pinpoint
the
location
of
the
comets
erupting
nucleus
for
the
giotto
probe
to
dive
in
only
kilometers
miles
away
in
march
of
as
planned
the
two
vegas
arrived
at
venus
in
june
of
vega
released
its
payload
first
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
lander
making
a
twoday
descent
towards
the
planet
the
craft
touched
the
upper
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
june
sixtyone
kilometers
miles
above
the
venerean
surface
a
small
container
was
released
by
the
lander
which
produced
a
parachute
at
kilometers
miles
altitude
thus
the
first
balloon
probe
ever
to
explore
venus
had
successfully
arrived
one
kilometer
after
the
opening
of
the
parachute
helium
gas
was
pumped
into
the
tefloncoated
plastic
balloon
inflating
it
to
a
diameter
of
meters
feet
dangling
on
a
tether
thirteen
meters
feet
below
was
the
instrument
package
properly
known
as
an
aerostat
the
top
part
of
the
aerostat
consisted
of
a
cone
which
served
as
an
antenna
and
tether
attachment
point
to
the
balloon
beneath
it
was
the
transmitter
electronics
and
instruments
connected
at
the
bottom
was
a
nephelometer
for
measuring
cloud
particles
the
aerostat
was
painted
with
a
special
white
finish
to
keep
at
bay
the
corroding
mist
of
sulfuric
acid
which
permeated
the
planets
atmosphere
the
vega
balloon
was
dropped
into
the
night
side
of
venus
just
north
of
the
equator
scientists
were
concerned
that
the
gas
bag
would
burst
in
the
heat
of
daylight
so
they
placed
it
in
the
darkened
hemisphere
to
give
the
craft
as
much
time
as
possible
to
return
data
this
action
necessitated
that
the
landers
come
down
in
the
dark
as
well
effectively
removing
the
camera
systems
used
on
previous
missions
the
author
wonders
though
if
they
could
have
used
floodlights
similar
to
the
ones
attached
to
venera
and
in
when
soviet
scientists
had
thought
the
planets
surface
was
enshrouded
in
a
perpetual
twilight
due
to
the
permanently
thick
cloud
cover
the
first
balloon
transmitted
for
hours
right
into
the
day
hemisphere
before
its
lithium
batteries
failed
covering
kilometers
miles
the
threat
of
bursting
in
the
day
heat
did
not
materialize
the
vega
balloon
was
stationed
at
a
altitude
after
dropping
ballast
at
fifty
kilometers
thirty
miles
for
this
was
considered
the
most
active
of
the
three
main
cloud
layers
reported
by
pioneer
venus
in
indeed
the
balloon
was
pushed
across
the
planet
at
speeds
up
to
kilometers
miles
per
hour
strong
vertical
winds
bobbed
the
craft
up
and
down
two
to
three
hundred
meters
to
feet
through
most
of
the
journey
the
layers
air
temperature
averaged
forty
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
pressure
was
a
mere
earth
atmosphere
the
nephelometer
could
find
no
clear
regions
in
the
surrounding
clouds
early
in
the
first
balloons
flight
the
vega
lander
was
already
headed
towards
the
venerean
surface
both
landers
were
equipped
with
a
soil
drill
and
analyzer
similar
to
the
ones
carried
on
venera
and
in
however
vega
would
become
unable
to
report
the
composition
of
the
ground
at
its
landing
site
in
rusalka
planitia
the
mermaid
plain
north
of
aphrodite
terra
while
still
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
away
from
landing
a
timer
malfunction
caused
the
drill
to
accidentally
begin
its
programmed
activity
sixteen
kilometers
miles
above
the
surface
there
was
neither
any
way
to
shut
off
the
instrument
before
touchdown
nor
reactivate
it
after
landing
this
was
unfortunate
not
only
for
the
general
loss
of
data
but
also
for
the
fact
that
most
of
venus
was
covered
with
such
smooth
lowlevel
lava
plains
and
had
never
before
been
directly
examined
nevertheless
the
surface
temperature
and
pressure
was
calculated
at
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
earth
atmospheres
respectively
during
the
landers
minutes
of
ground
transmissions
a
large
amount
of
background
infrared
radiation
was
also
recorded
at
the
site
as
had
been
done
when
the
drills
and
cameras
on
venera
and
had
failed
in
december
of
the
soviets
focused
on
the
data
returned
during
the
landers
plunge
through
the
atmosphere
the
frenchsoviet
malachite
mass
spectrometer
detected
sulfur
chlorine
and
possibly
phosphorus
it
is
the
sulfur
possibly
from
active
volcanoes
which
gives
the
venerean
clouds
their
yellowish
color
the
sigma
gas
chromatograph
found
that
every
cubic
meter
of
air
between
an
altitude
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
contained
one
milligram
grain
of
sulfuric
acid
the
vega
data
on
the
overall
structure
of
the
cloud
decks
appeared
to
be
at
odds
with
the
information
from
pioneer
venus
the
case
was
made
even
stronger
by
the
fact
that
vega
results
nearly
matched
its
twin
the
vegas
found
only
two
main
cloud
layers
instead
of
the
three
reported
by
the
us
probes
the
layers
were
three
to
five
kilometers
to
miles
thick
at
altitudes
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
the
clouds
persisted
like
a
thin
fog
until
clearing
at
an
altitude
of
kilometers
miles
much
lower
than
the
pv
readings
one
possibility
for
the
discrepan
cies
may
have
been
radical
structural
changes
in
the
venerean
air
over
the
last
seven
years
when
the
lander
and
balloon
finally
went
silent
the
last
functioning
part
of
the
vega
mission
the
flyby

on
for
a
millionkilometer
millionmile
journey
around
the
sun
to
become
the
first

to
meet
comet
halley
on
march
the
bus
made
a
pass
at
the
dark
and
icy
visitor
before
traveling
on
in
interplanetary
space
the
soviets
had
accomplished
their
first
mission
to
two
celestial
bodies
with
one
space
vessel
on
june
vega
released
its
landerballoon
payload
for
a
twoday
fall
towards
venus
like
its
duplicate
the
vega
balloon
radioed
information
back
to
the
twenty
antennae
tracking
it
on
earth
for
hours
before
battery
failure
on
the
morning
side
of
the
planet
during
its
flight
over
venus
the
second
balloon
entered
in
a
rather
still
environment
which
became
less
so
twenty
hours
into
the
mission
after
hours
mission
time
the
air
became
even
more
turbulent
for
a
further
eight
hours
when
the
balloon
passed
over
a
five
kilometer
threemile
mountain
on
the
continent
of
aphrodite
terra
a
powerful
downdraft
pulled
the
craft
kilometers
miles
towards
the
surface
temperature
sensors
on
the
vega
balloon
reported
that
the
air
layer
it
was
moving
through
was
consistently
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
cooler
than
the
area
explored
by
the
vega
balloon
this
was
corroborated
by
the
vega
lander
as
it
passed
through
the
balloons
level
no
positive
indications
of
lightning
were
made
by
either
balloon
and
the
second
aerostats
nephelometer
failed
to
function
the
vega
lander
touched
down
on
the
northern
edge
of
aphrodite
terras
western
arm
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
kilometers
miles
southeast
of
vega
the
landers
resting
place
was
smoother
than
thought
indicating
either
a
very
ancient
and
worn
surface
or
a
relatively
young
one
covered
in
fresh
lava
the
soil
drill
was
in
working
order
and
reported
a
rock
type
known
as
anorthositetroctolite
rare
on
earth
but
present
in
lunas
highlands
this
rock
is
rich
in
aluminum
and
silicon
but
lacking
in
iron
and
magnesium
a
high
degree
of
sulfur
was
also
present
in
the
soil
the
air
around
vega
measured
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
earth
atmospheres
essentially
a
typical
day
or
night
on
venus
far
above
the
vega
lander
its
carrier
bus
sped
past
venus
at
a
distance
of
kilometers
miles
and
followed
its
twin
to
comet
halley
making
a
closer
flyby
on
march
at
just
kilometers
miles
both
probes
helped
to
reveal
that
the
comet
is
a
very
dark
and
irregularshaped
mass
about
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
rotating
once
every
hours
give
or
take
three
hours
since
both
vega
craft
were
still
functioning
after
their
halley
encounters
soviet
scientists
considered
an
option
to
send
the
probes
to
other
celestial
objects
one
prime
target
was
the
near
earth
planetoid
adonis
which
vega
could
pass
at
a
distance
of
six
million
kilometers
million
miles
sadly
the
soviets
had
to
back
out
on
the
opportunity
to
become
the
first
nation
to
fly
a
spacecraft
past
a
planetoid
when
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
not
enough
maneuvering
fuel
in
the
probe
to
reach
adonis
as
planned
vega
and
were
quietly
shut
down
in
early
future
plans
diverted
the
impressive
vega
mission
had
given
some
scientists
numerous
ideas
and
hope
for
even
more
ambitious
expeditions
to
the
second
world
from
the
sun
one
example
was
the
vesta
mission
planned
for
the
early
this
sovietfrench
collaboration
called
for
the
launch
of
multiple
probes
on
a
single
proton
rocket
in
either
or
the
craft
would
first
swing
by
venus
and
drop
off
several
landers
and
balloon
probes
the
aerostats
would
be
designed
to
survive
in
the
planets
corrosive
atmosphere
for
up
to
one
month
a
large
improvement
over
the
vega
balloons
two
days
the
mission
would
then
head
out
to
investigate
several
planetoids
and
comets
including
a
possible
landing
on
vesta
thus
the
mission
name
the
most
reflective
main
belt
planetoid
as
seen
from
earth
unfortunately
for
venus
exploration
plans
began
to
change
in
the
soviet
union
in
the
soviets
decided
to
reroute
the
vesta
mission
to
the
red
planet
mars
instead
of
venus
keeping
the
comet
and
planetoid
aspects
intact
by
this
time
in
the
soviet
space
program
interest
was
focusing
on
mars
already
under
construction
was
an
entirely
new
probe
design
called
phobos
two
members
of
this
class
were
planned
to
leave
earth
in
and
orbit
mars
the
next
year
phobos
and
would
then
place
the
first
instruments
on
mars
largest
moon
phobos
all
this
was
a
prelude
to
even
more
advanced
mars
expeditions
including
balloon
probes
rovers
soil
sample
return
craft
and
eventually
human
explorers
in
the
early
twentyfirst
century
the
environment
of
venus
was
just
too
hostile
for
any
serious
consideration
of
human
colonization
in
the
near
future
but
things
began
to
look
bleak
for
soviet
venus
and
mars
exploration
both
phobos
probes
failed
to
complete
their
missions
one
losing
contact
on
the
way
to
the
red
planet
in
and
the
other
going
silent
in
mars
orbit
just
one
week
before
the
planned
moon
landing
in
march
of
in
a
plan
was
devised
for
a
venus
orbiter
to
drop
eight
to
ten
penetrators
around
the
planet
in
several
years
later
the
mission
launch
date
was
moved
to
the
year
and
has
now
been
put
on
indefinite
hold
no
other
official
soviet
missions
to
venus
have
since
been
put
forth
a
sad
commentary
after
twentyfive
years
of
continuous
robotic
exploration
of
the
planet
during
the
late
a
drastic
political
and
economic
change
was
taking
over
the
soviet
union
president
mikhail
gorbachev
began
to
open
up
his
nation
to
the
benefits
of
increased
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
nations
particularly
those
in
the
west
while
the
culture
became
less
oppressive
than
in
the
past
the
economy
was
taking
a
very
rough
ride
as
it
also
underwent
the
effects
of
a
free
market
these
effects
hit
everywhere
including
the
space
program
missions
at
all
levels
were
cut
back
the
soviets
began
making
almost
desperate
attempts
to
cooperate
with
other
spacefaring
nations
either
to
keep
their
remaining
programs
alive
or
just
to
make
money
in
early
it
was
reported
that
the
soviets
were
offering
for
sale
several
fullyequipped
veneras
they
had
in
storage
for
the
price
of
million
dollars
each
an
incredibly
low
price
for
any
planetary
probe
no
nation
took
them
up
on
the
bargain
meanwhile
the
united
states
was
gearing
up
for
new
venus
missions
of
their
own
magellan
and
galileo
the
us
reactivated
their
longdormant
planetary
exploration
with
the
launch
of
the
space
shuttle
atlantis
on
may
aboard
the
shuttle
was
the
magellan
spacecraft
a
combination
of
spare
parts
from
other
us
probes
designed
to
make
the
most
detailed
and
complete
radarmapping
of
venus
in
history
when
magellan
reached
the
second
world
in
august
of
it
would
be
able
to
map
almost
the
entire
planet
down
to
a
resolution
of
meters
feet
surpassing
the
abilities
of
venera
and
in
the
interim
another
american
probe
was
launched
from
a
space
shuttle
which
would
make
a
quick
flyby
of
venus
on
its
way
to
orbit
the
giant
planet
jupiter
in
on
october
the
shuttle
atlantis
released
its
second
unmanned
planetary
probe
into
space
named
galileo
after
the
famous
italian
astronomer
who
discovered
the
probes
primary
targets
major
moons
in
in
the
absence
of
a
powerful
enough
booster
to
send
galileo
on
a
direct
flight
to
the
jovian
planet
the
probe
was
sent
around
venus
and
earth
several
times
to
build
up
enough
speed
to
reach
jupiter
as
a
result
venus
became
galileos
first
planetary
goal
in
february
of
the
probe
radioed
back
images
of
the
planets
swirling
clouds
and
further
indications
of
lightning
in
that
violent
atmosphere
on
the
drawing
boards
with
the
incredible
success
of
magellan
in
the
last
few
years
new
plans
have
been
laid
out
for
further
journeys
to
venus
scien
tists
in
the
us
have
talked
to
space
scientists
in
the
former
soviet
union
now
the
commonwealth
of
independent
states
since
january
of
a
cooperative
effort
to
launch
new
venera
lander
missions
within
in
the
next
decade
japan
india
and
the
esa
have
also
considered
their
own
venus
missions
in
the
next
few
decades
in
february
of
nasa
came
up
with
several
new
venus
projects
as
part
of
their
discovery
program
for
launching
inexpensive
probes
throughout
the
solar
system
for
venus
two
missions
were
selected
for
further
study
a
venus
multiprobe
mission
involving
the
landing
of
fourteen
small
probes
over
one
hemisphere
to
measure
winds
air
temperature
and
pressure
and
the
venus
composition
probe
designed
to
study
venus
atmosphere
while
descending
through
the
thick
air
with
the
aid
of
a
parachute
much
as
the
soviets
had
done
since
final
project
decisions
will
be
made
in
humans
on
venus
will
a
human
ever
be
able
to
stand
on
the
surface
of
venus
at
present
the
leadmelting
temperatures
and
crushing
air
pressure
would
be
threatening
to
any
earth
life
not
protected
in
something
even
tougher
than
a
venera
lander
plans
have
been
looked
into
changing
the
environment
of
venus
itself
into
something
more
like
earths
however
it
should
be
noted
that
any
such
undertaking
will
require
the
removal
of
much
of
the
thick
carbon
dioxide
atmosphere
a
major
reduction
in
surface
heat
and
the
ability
to
speed
up
the
planets
rotation
rate
to
something
a
bit
faster
than
once
every
earth
days
such
a
project
may
take
centuries
if
not
millennia
in
the
meantime
efforts
should
be
made
to
better
understand
venus
as
its
exists
today
we
still
have
yet
to
fully
know
how
a
world
so
seemingly
similar
to
earth
in
many
important
ways
became
instead
such
a
deadly
place
will
earth
ever
suffer
this
fate
perhaps
venus
holds
the
answers
such
answers
may
best
be
found
through
international
cooperation
including
the
nation
which
made
the
first
attempts
to
lift
the
cloudy
veils
from
venus

a
bright
light
phenomenon
was
observed
in
the
eastern
finland
on
april
at
ut
two
people
saw
a
bright
luminous
pillarshaped
phenomenon
in
the
low
eastern
horizont
near
mikkeli
the
head
of
the
pillar
was
circular
the
lower
part
was
a
little
winding
it
was
like
a
monster
they
told
they
were
little
frightened
soon
the
yellowish
pillar
became
enlarged
a
bright
spot
like
the
sun
was
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
phenomenon
at
last
the
light
landed
behind
the
nearby
forest
now
there
was
only
luminous
trails
in
the
sky
which
were
visible
till
morning
sunrise
the
same
phenomenon
was
observed
also
by
jaakko
kokkonen
in
lappeenranta
at
ut
he
saw
a
luminous
yellowish
trail
in
the
low
northeastern
horizont
the
altitude
of
the
trail
was
only
about
degrees
soon
the
trail
began
to
grow
taller
a
loop
was
appeared
in
the
head
of
the
trail
it
was
like
a
spoon
this
lasted
only
seconds
now
the
altitude
was
about
five
degress
above
horizont
he
noted
a
bright
spot
at
the
upper
stage
of
loop
the
spot
was
at
magnitude
the
loop
became
enlarged
and
the
spot
was
now
visible
in
the
middle
of
the
loop
a
cartwheelshaped
trail
was
appeared
round
the
bright
spot
after
a
minute
the
spot
disappeared
and
only
fuzzy
trails
were
only
visible
in
the
low
horizont
luminous
trails
were
still
visible
at
ut
in
the
morning
sky
the
phenomenon
was
caused
by
a
russian
rocket
i
dont
know
if
there
were
satellite
launches
in
plesetsk
cosmodrome
near
arkhangelsk
but
this
may
be

experiment
too
since

having
this
widely

interplanetary
network
was
the
only
sure
way
to
locate
a
random
burst
with
only
one
detector
one
cannot
locate
a
burst
except
to
say
its
somewhere
in
the
field
of
view
with
two
detectors
one
can
use
the
time
that
the
burst
is
seen
in
each
detector
to
narrow
the
location
to
a
thin
annulus
on

with

one
gets
intersecting
annuli
giving
two
possible

if
one

is
impossible
because

blocked

peter
peterfoddjobuchicagoedu
all
of
this
is
very
valid
and
very
true
but
to
add
to
this
explaniation
each
individual
detector
also
has
a
built
in
failsafe
just
so
the
detector
does
not
read
the
background
radiationie
cosmic
rays
if
i
remember
right
the
detectors
go
off
about
to
sigma
above
the
background
this
is
so
they
dont
catch
particularly
energetic
cosmic
rays
that
would
normally
set
it
off
even
with
this
buffer
they
still
have
to

i
dont

i
do

the
problem
set
that
we
did
not

long

so
ill
use
that
and
hope
its
what
you
wanted
this
is
a
highly
simplified
problem
with
a
very
simple
burst
bursts
are
usually
more
complex
than
this
example
i
will
use
here
our
burst
has
a
peak
flux
of
ergs
and
a
duration
of
seconds
during
the
frst
second
of
the
burst
and
the
last
seconds
its
flux
is
half
of
the
peak
flux
its
flux
is
the
peak
flux
the
rest
of
the
time
assume
that
the
background
flux
is
erg
then
we
had
to
find
the
integrated
luminosity
of
the
burst
for
several
different
spheres
cloud
radius
the
edge
of
the
galaxy
or
the
edge
of
the
galactic
corona
and
lastly
at
a
we
integrated
the
flux
over
all
time
to
find
the
fluence
then
used
the
old
standby
formula
for
a
radius
of
pc
we
found
an
l
around
ergsec
pretty
energetic
for
close
by
for
the
coronal
model
we
found
around
ergsec
and
lastly
for
the
cosmological
model
an
thats
what
youd
call
moderately
energetic
id

any

what
could

de

you

you

origin
of
your

system
one

sees
the

plane
and
measures
the
angle
from
the
zero
point
of
his

which
is
the
same
as
yours
the
two
angles
are
different
and
you
should
be
able
to
triangulate
the
position
of
your
burst
and
maybe
find
a
source
to
my
knowledge
no
one
has
been

do
this
uh
no

are

that

could

bill
may
be
staged
during

all
this
should
produce
a
positive
reaction
from

office
as
more
is
known
it
will
be
passed
on
however
even
if
we
are
successful
in
getting
him
to
support
the
bill
this
alone
will
not
ensure
passage
of
the
bill
for
any
bill
to
become
law
one
of
three
conditions
must
exist
either
the
bill
must
reflect
widespread
national
support
for
an
issue
such
as
extension
of
unemployment
insurance
benefits
be
propelled
by
highpriced
lobbyists
were
out
of
luck
there
or
have
widespread
support
within
congress
due
to
small
but
widespread
constituent
support
the
latter
is
the
path
that
we
by
necessity
must
choose
this
means
that
the
introduction
of
the
lunar
resources
data
purchase
act
must
be
immediately
accompanied
by
a
large
number
of
congresspersons
sponsorship
of
the
bill
to
accomplish
this
we
need
activists
to
ask
their
congressperson
to
support
the
lunar
resources
data
purchase
act
now
to
wait
until
the
bill
is
introduced
is
simply
too
late
it
takes
time
to
have
a
congresspersons
staff
review
a
bill
if
your
congressperson
mentions
that
the
bill
is
not
yet
introduced
please
elicit
their
opinion
of
the
bill
as
currently
written
we
appreciate
all
comments
on
the

some
of

rooted

many

may
never

known
a

where
the

were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by

whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the

whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an

the

age
changed
all
that
more
on
mans
effect
on

but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a

that
man
hasnt
fouled

some
way
i
think
my
point
about
a
desire
for
beauty
is
valid
even
if
it
cant
ever
be
perfectly
achieved
i
agree
that
the
desire
for
beauty
is
valid
but
i
think
your
desire
to
impose
your
vision
of
beauty
is
not
you
mention
the
ageold
desire
to
somehow
get
up
there
but
ignore
the
beauty
of
the
actual
achievment
of
that
vision
you
mention
the
beauty
of
a
very
dark
sky
not
impeded
by
the
effects
of
humans
but
ignore
the
beauty
of
the
asdarkascanbe
sky
that
is
only
visible
from
space
a
vision
that
we
or
at
least
our
descendents
may
one
day
be
able
to
see
in
part
because
of
efforts
that
others
call
ugly
one
day
i
hope
humans
will
be
able
to
look
out
not
upon
half
the
heavens
with
only
naturecreted
lights
but
upon
all
of
the
heavens
with
no
lights
if
advertising
in
space
can
help
us
reach
that
goal
it
is
no
less
beautiful
for
the
way
we
reach
it
than
the
pristine
sky
of
yesteryear
or
yestercentury
which
is
totally
unreachable
one
of
the
original
conceptions
of

in
wetsern

i
dont

theres

what
physical

simply
disallow

range

to
where
temp
is

what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
david
gives
good
explaination
of
the
deductions
from
the
isotropic
edged
distribution
to
whit
they
are
either
part
of
the
universe
or
part
of
the
oort
cloud
why
couldnt
they
be
earth
centred
with
the
edge
occuring
at
the
edge
of
the
gravisphere
i
know
there
isnt
any
mechanism
for
them
but
there
isnt
a

for
the

i
thinking

dandridge
cole

collaborated
on
a
book
titled
habitable
planets
for
man
i
think
in
it
should
be
available
in
most
good
libraries
or
through
interlibrary
loan
it
answered
the
questions
you
ask
speculatively
of
course
along
with
many
more
that
need
to
be
considered
in
habitability
studies
length
of
day
for
daynight
temperature
variation
and
agricultural
concerns
partial
pressures
of
certain
unexpected
gasses
ever
hear
of
xenon
narcosis
neither
did
i
density
of
particulates
in
the
atm
and
their
composition
ever
hear
of
silicosis
not
much
fun
etc
climate
isnt
a
global
phenomenon
and
probably
neednt
concern
you
but
axial
tilt
ought
to
it
plays
a
large
part
in
determining
the
severity
of
seasonal
differences
and
a
lesser
but
still
significant
part
in
determining
the
speed
of

that

several

redesign
team
srt
provided
a
detailed

report
to
the
advisory

the
daylong
meeting
was
held
in

included
a
preliminary
mission
and
goals
statement
for

research
the
assessment
process
and
the

concepts
also
were
held
the

then
presented
the
three
options

presented
the
a
option
priest
said
the
team
is
working
to
define
a
station
that
meets
cost
goals
and
has
identified
three
distinct
phases
of
evolution
power
station
human
tended
and
permanent
presence
the
team
will
define
the
minimum
capability
needed
to
achieve
each
phase
the
total
cost
of
each
phase
and
the
achievable
capability
for
budget
levels
the
a
option
uses
current
or
simplified
freedom
hardware
where
cost
effective
and
is
considering
other
existing
systems
such
as
the
socalled
spacecraft
the
orbiter
and
spacelab
the

griffin
detailed
the
evolution
of
the

with
minor
changes
to
the
communications
and
tracking
system
crew
health
care
system
and
eclss
and
a
major
change
to
the

would
be
achieved
in

would
build
out
the
other
section
of
truss
with
another
set
of
pv
modules
thermal

and
propulsion
systems
the
freedom
derived
configuration
could
achieve
an
international

three
more
flights
to
bring
up
the
habitat
module
a

griffin
told
the
redesign
advisory
committee
that
eliminating
hardware
would
not
by
itself
meet
budget
guidelines
for
the
freedom
derived
option
major
reductions
or
deferrals
must
occur
in
other
areas
including
program

core
station
concept
a
shuttle
external
tank
and
solid
rocket
boosters
would
be
used
to
launch
the
station
into
orbit
shuttle
main
engines
would
be
mounted
to
the
tail
of
the
station
module
for
launch
and
jettisoned
after
et
separation
the

feet
long
would
provide
cubic
feet

i
was
suggesting
that
the

have
the
right
to
a
dark
uncluttered

sorry
you
have
a
wish
for
an
uncluttered
night
sky
but
it
isnt
a
right
when
you
get
down
to
it
you
actually
have
no
rights
that
the
majority
havent
agreed
to
give
you
and
them
in
the
process
its
a
common
misconception
that
being
born
somehow
endows
you
with
rights
to
this
that
and
the
other
sadly
this
is
not
true
now
if
you
want
to
talk
about
the
responsibility
that
should
go
with
the
power
to
clutter
the
night
sky
then
thats
a
different
matter
greg
nicholls
vidi
nichovnetibmcom
or
vici
nichoolympusdemoncouk
veni
according
to
this
reasoning
there
are
no
rights
at
least
none
that
i
can
think
of
lets
see
do
i
have
a
right
to
unpolluted
air
no
because
the
majority
drive
cars
and
use
goods
that
create
air
pollution
in
the
manufacturing
process
do
i
have
the
right
to
clean
water
i
guess
not
by
the
same
reasoning
i
could
go
on
with
these
examples
for
a
long
time
look
at
nazi
germany
because
of
the
majority
jews
homosexuals
blacks
and
others
that
were
different
had
no
rights
in
fact
they
were
terrorized
imprisoned
and
slaughtered
in
this
country
did
blacks
have
the
right
to
be
free
from
slavery
i
guess
not
because
the
majority
said
that
slavery
was
good
for
them
i
think
that
a
right
has
a
moral
imperative
if
a
law
imposed
by
the
majority
is
immoral
one
should
not
follow
it
in
fact
one
should
do
everything
in
hisher
power
to
stop
it
of
course
that
doesnt
mean
that
i
would
lose
all
common
sense
to
break
the
law
just
because
i
thought
it
was
immoral
i

morally
opposed
to
the
us
government
taking
my
money
and
spending
it
on
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
terrorism
this
is
precisely
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
we
should
persude
people
by
logic
pointing
out
that
it
is
in
their
selfinterest
to
let
all
have
equal
rights
in
all
aspects
of
life
including
adequate
housing
food
and
medical
care
i
just
happen
to
think
that
for
a
full
life
the
aesthetic
of
beauty
and
joy
is
also
necessary
that
is
why
i
consider
an
uncluttered
night
sky
a
right
have
you
ever
been
out
in
the
desert
away
from
local
lights
and
most
people
the
sky
is
dark
and
transparent
the
milky
way
is
ablaze
with
more
detail
than
you
thought
possible
the
beauty
and
wonder
takes
your
breath
away
now
imagine
you
live
in
the
worst
ghetto
say
in
la
due
to
light
pollution
you
have
never
seen
a
dark
sky
you
might
in
fact
never
not
in
your
whole
life
ever
see
the
majesty
of
the
night
sky
every
where
around
you
you
see
squalor
and
through
your
life
runs
a
thread
of
dispair
what
is
there
to
live
for
i
admit
these
two
scenarios
are
extreme
examples
but
i
have
seen
both
i
for
one
need
dreams
and
hopes
and
yes
beauty
as
a
reason
for
living
that
is
why
i
consider
an
uncluttered
night
sky

try

and
you
could
have

the

just
isnt
designed

land
with
that
much
weight
in
the
payload
is
it
because
two
shuttle
flights
would
be
required
adding
to
the
alredy
horrendous
expense
of

that
is
a
concern
too
and
the
loss
of
science
during
the
time
that
it

plus
a
fear
that
if
it
comes
down
some
bigwig
might
not
allow

up

the
main
concern
i
believe
is
the
danger
of
the
landing
just
to
add
another
bad
vibe
they
also
increase
the
risk
of
damaging
an

my

if
this

a

i
submitted

on

got
a
message
that
my

might
not
have
gone
out
considering
the
confusing

contest

there
are
too

damn
it
the

destructive

as

i
suspect
that
my

did
not

i
aint
saying
that
dark

are
included
in
these
rights
although
we
can
only
preserve
any
rights
by
exercising
them
anyway
here
are
my
thoughts
on
this
id
like
to
add
that
some
of
the
protests
do
not
come
from
a
strictly
practical
consideration
of
what
pollution
levels
are
acceptable
for

activities
by

some
of
what
i
would
complain
about
is
rooted
in
aesthetics
many
readers
may
never
have
known
a
time
where
the
heavens
were
pristine
sacred
unsullied
by
the
actions
of
humans
the
space
between
the
stars
as
profoundly
black
as
an
abyss
can
be
with
full
horizons
and
a
pure
sky
one
could
look
out
upon
half
of
all
creation
at
a
time
none
of
which
had
any
connection
with
the
petty
matters
of
man
any
lights
were
supplied
solely
by
nature
uncorruptable
by
men
whole
religions
were
based
on
mortal
man
somehow
getting
up
there
and
becoming
immortal
as
the
stars
whether
by
apotheosis
or
a
belief
in
an
afterlife
the
space
age
changed
all
that
the
effect
of
the
first
sputniks
and
echo
etc
on
this
view
could
only
happen
once
to
see
a
light
crossing
the
night
sky
and
know
it
was
put
there
by
us
puny
people
is
still
impressive
and
the
sense
of
size
one
gets
by
assimilating
the
scales
involved
is
also
awesome
even
if
the
few
hundreds
or
thousands
of
miles
involved
is
still
dwarfed
by
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
there
is
still
a
hunger
for
the
pure
beauty
of
a
virgin
sky
yes
i
know
aircraft
are
almost
always
in
sight
i
have
to
live
in
a
very
populated
area
miles
from
an
international
airport
currently
where
light
pollution
on
the
ground
is
ghastly
the
impact
of
humans
is
so
extreme
here
virtually
no
place
exists
that
has
not
been
shaped
sculpted
modified
trashed
or
whipped
into
shape
by
the
hands
of
man
in
some
places
the
only

larger
than

i
visited
some
friends
up
in
the
appalacian
mountains
one
weekend
getting
away
from
it
all
paved
roads
indoor
plumbing
malls
and
it
felt
good
for
a

then
i
quickly
noticed
the
hollow
was
directly
under

main
flight
path
into
dulles
miles
to
the
east
their
security
light
didnt
help
matters
much
either
but
ive
heard
the
artic
wilderness
gets
lots
of
high
air
traffic
so
i
know
the
skies
are
rarely
perfect
but
there
is
still
this
desire
to
see
a
place
that
man
hasnt
fouled
in
some
way
i

theyve
been
trying
this
forever

i
can

advertisements
would
be
if
seen
up
so
high
if
ya
gotta
make
a
buck
on
it
displaying
products
in

at
least
consider
the
reactions
from
those
for
whom
the
sky
is
a
last
beautiful
refuge
from
the
baseness
of
modern
life
to
be
open

this

if

can
it

i
suppose

could
be

for
supporting
this
intrusion
on

subject
re
vandalizing
the
sky
i
didnt
want
to
quote
all
the
stuff
thats
been
said
recently
i
just
wanted
to
add
a
point
the
whole
question
of
a
right
to
a
dark
sky
revolves
around
the
definition
of
a
right
moral
rights
and
natural
rights
are
all
well
and
good
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
a
right
is
whatever
you
or
someone
representing
you
can
enforce
in
most
civilizations
the
government
or
the
church
or
both
defines
what
the
rights
of
the
citizens
are
and
then
enforces
those
rights
for
them
here
in
the
us
the
constitution
provides
a
bill
of
rights
from
which
most
if
not
all
legal
rights
are
considered
to
derive
im
sure
that
most
other
countries
have
comparable
documents
if
you
can
persuade
a
court
that
you
have
a
right
to
a
dark
sky
derived
in
some
manner
from
the
bill
of
rights
in
the
us
you
can
prevent
maybe
these
billboards
from
being
launched
to
keep
anyone
in
the
world
from
launching
then
gets
into
international
law
and

subject
re

do
space
surveillance
the
european
space
agency
has
involvement
with
remote
earth
observation
and
i
presume
this
includes
surveillance
optical
etc
so
its
not
just
the
usussrex
who
are
in
the
game
but
what
is
the
game
what
can
be
done
with
space
observation
the
military
functions
of
missile
spotting
troop
spotting
etc
are
well
documented
but
what
about
anything
else
the
biggest
eg
i
can
think
of
is
to
get
a
metal
sensing
sat
over
a
paying
country
and
scan
their
territory
for
precious
metals
more
importantly
if
radar
can
spot
water
vapour
clouds
presumably
a
radar
based
sat
will
be
capable
of
spotting
riversopen
water
and
underground
water
from

this
would
be
a
positive
life
saver
for

other

clean
water

program
would
be

imense
benifit

considerably

how
about

is
there

an

what

are

given
the

i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic

david
gives
good
explaination
of
the
deductions
from
the
isotropic
edged
distribution
to
whit
they
are
either
part
of
the
universe
or
part
of
the
oort
cloud
why
couldnt
they
be
earth
centred
with
the
edge
occuring
at
the
edge
of
the
gravisphere
i
know
there
isnt
any
mechanism
for
them
but
there
isnt
a
mechanism
for
the
others
either
what
on
earth
is
the
gravisphere
anyway
before
its
decay
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
had
a
gamma
ray
detector
as
does
ulysses
they
detect
the
brightest
bursts
that
the
earth
orbit
detectors
do
so
the
bursts
are
at
least
at
oort
cloud
distances
in
principle
four
detectors
spaced
out
by
a
few
au
would
see
parallax
if
the
bursts
are
of
solar
system
origin
the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sources
is
that
absolutely
no
plausible
mechanism
has
been
proposed
it
would
have
to
involve
new
physics
as
far
as
i
can
tell
closest
to
conventional
oort
sources
is
a

subject
words
from
the
chairman
of
boeing
on
ssto
type
stuff
yesterday
i
went
to
the
boeing
shareholders
meeting
it
was
a
bit
shorter
than
i
expected
last
year
when
the
stock
was
first
down
they
made
a
big
presentation
on
the
and
other
programs
this
year
it
was
much
more
barebones
in
any
case
i
wanted
to
ask
a
question
that
the
board
of
directors
would
hear
and
so
i
got
there
early
and
figured
that
if
i
didnt
get
to
the
mike
maybe
they
would
read
mine
off
of
a
card
and
so
i
wrote
it
down
and
handed
it
in
after
the
meeting
started
mr
shrontz
said
that
he
would
only
answer
written
questions
in
order
to
be
fair
to
the
people
in
the
overflow
room
that
only
had
monitors
downstairs
naturally
i
was
crushed
so
when
question
and
answer
time
came
i
was
suprised
to
find
my
question
being
read
and
answered
admittedly
near
the
end
of
the
ones
that
he
took
presumably
getting
there
early
and
getting
the
question
in
early
made
all
the
difference
so
on
to
the
substance
the
question
was
is
boeing
looking
at
anything
beyond
the
high
speed
civil
transport
such
as
a
commercial
space
launch
system
and
if
not
how
will
boeing
compete
with
the
reusable
single
stage
to
orbit
technology
presently
being
developed
by
mcdonnell
douglass
well
he
read
it
without
a
hitch
and
without
editing
with
impressed
me
then
he
answered
it
very
quickly
treating
it
as
a
two
part
question
last
part
first
this
is
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
what
he
said
as
far
as
single
stage
to
orbit
technology
we
think
that
we
have
a
better
answer
in
a
two
stage
approach
and
we
are
talking
to
some
of
our
customers
about
that
as
far
as
commercialization
that
is
a
long
ways
off
the
high
speed
civil
transport
is
about
as
far
out
as
our
commercial
planning
goes
at
this
point
so
this
tells
me
that
boeing
still
considers
space
to
be
a
noncommercial
arena
and
for
the
most
part
this
is
true
however
it
also
tells
me
that
they
consider
there
to
be
enough
money
in
building
space
launchers
for
them
to
persue
work
on
their
own
now
i
do
have
a
friend
on
the
spacelifter
program
at
boeing
actually
this
is
a
misnomer
as
there
is
no
spacelifter
contract
for
the
work
that
this
guy
is
doing
however
he
is
doing
work
in
preparation
of
a
proposal
for
space
lifter
contracts
he
wont
tell
me
what
he
is
doing
but
maybe
this
is
where
the
tsto
action
is
taking
place
at
boeing
at
the
very
minimum
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
boeing
said
that
they
have
an
approach
in
mind
and
they
are
trying
to
do
something
with
it
anybody
know
anything
further

what

was
not
which

was
which

dewey
b
larson
was
a
retired
engineer
with
a
bachelor
of
science
degree
in
engineering
science
from
oregon
state
university
he
developed
the
theory
described
in
his
books
while
trying
to
find
a
way
to
mathematically
calculate
the
properties
of
chemical
compounds
based
only
on
the
elements
they
contain
the
universe
of
motion
describes
the
astrophysical
portions
of
larsons
consistent
integrated
comprehensive
general
unified
theory
of
the
physical
universe
a
kind
of
grand
unified
field
theory
that
orthodox
physicists
and
astrophysicists
claim
to
be
looking
for
it
is
built
on
two
postulates
about
the
physical
and
mathematical
nature
of
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
is
composed
entirely
of
one
component
motion
existing
in
three
dimensions
in
discrete
units
and
with
two
reciprocal
aspects
space
and
time
the
physical
universe
conforms
to
the
relations
of
ordinary
commutative
mathematics
its
primary
magnitudes
are
absolute
and
its
geometry
is
euclidean
from
these
two
postulates
larson
was
able
to
build
a
complete
theoretical
universe
from
photons
and
subatomic
particles
to
the
giant
elliptical
galaxies
by
combining
the
concept
of
inward
and
outward
scalar
motions
with
translational
vibrational
rotational
and
rotational
vibrational
motions
at
each
step
in
the
development
he
was
able
to
match
parts
of
his
theoretical
universe
with
corresponding
parts
in
the
real
physical
universe
including
even
things
not
yet
discovered
for
example
in
his
book
he
first
predicted
the
existence
of
exploding
galaxies
several
years
before
astronomers
started
finding
them
they
are
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
comprehensive
theory
and
when
quasars
were
discovered
he
had
a
related
explanation
ready
for
those
also
as
a
result
of
his
theory
which
he
called
the
reciprocal
system
larson
totally
rejected
many
of
the
sacred
doctrines
of
orthodox
physicists
and
astrophysicists
including
black
holes
neutron
stars
degenerate
matter
quantum
wave
mechanics
as
applied
to
atomic
structure
nuclear
physics
general
relativity
relativistic
mass
increases
relativistic
doppler
shifts
nuclear
fusion
in
stars
and
the
big
bang
all
of
which
he
considered
to
be
nothing
more
than
mathematical
fantasies
he
was
very
critical
of
the
ad
hoc
assumptions
uncertainty
principles
solutions
in
principle
no
other
way
declarations
etc
used
to
maintain
them
the
universe
of
motion
is
divided
into
chapters
it
begins
with
a
description
of
how
galaxies
are
built
from
the
gravitational
attraction
between
globular
star
clusters
which
are
formed
from
intergalactic
gas
and
dust
clouds
that
accumulate
from
the
decay
products
of
cosmic
rays
coming
in
from
the
antimatter
half
of
the
physical
universe
galaxy
formation
from
the
mythical
big
bang
is
a
big
mystery
to
orthodox
astronomers
he
then
goes
on
to
describe
life
cycles
of
stars
and
how
binary
and
multiple
star
systems
and
solar
systems
result
from
type
i
supernova
explosions
of
single
stars
several
chapters
are
devoted
to
quasars
which
according
to
larson
are
denselypacked
clusters
of
stars
that
have
been
ejected
from
the
central
bulges
of
exploding
galaxies
and
are
actually
traveling
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
although
most
of
that
speed
is
away
from
us
in
time
astronomers
and
astrophysicists
who
run
up
against
observations
that
contradict
their
theories
would
find
larsons
explanations
quite
valuable
if
considered
with
an
open
mind
for
example
they
used
to
believe
that
gamma
ray
bursts
originated
from
pulsars
which
exist
primarily
in
the
plane
or
central
bulge
of
our
galaxy
but

off

that
i

ill
have
to
boil
it
down
a
bit
all
the
data
on
bursts
to
date
shows
a
smooth
random
distribution
that
means
they
arent
concentrated
in
galactic
cores
our
or
someone
elses
if
the
distribution
is
smooth
we
are
either
seeing
some
enormously
large
phenomena
scattered
at
the
edge
of
the
universe
said
phenomena
being
subject
to
debate
almost
as
vioent
as
the
phenomena
or
we
are
seeing
some
phenomena
out
at
like
the
oort
cloud
but
then
it
needs
some
potent
little
energy
source
that
isnt
detectable
by
any
other
current
methods
we
know
its
not
real
close
like
slightly
extra
solar
because
we
have
no
parallax
measurements
on
the
bursts
the
bursts
seem
to
bright
to
be
something
like
black
hole
quanta
or
super
string
impacts
or
something
like
that
so
everyone
is
watching
the

and
arguing

in

what

this

there
is
no

for
getting
all
the

out

with
any
significant
amount
of
baryons
around
there
will
be
a
lot
of
pair
production
which
makes
a
plasma
which
thermalizes
the
energy
it
has
trouble
generating
enough
energy
to
explain
the
most
powerful
bursts
ergs
it
happens
too
fast
compared
to
the
burst
duration
and
it
is
hard
to
make
tightbinaries
of
neutron
stars
another
cosmological
mechinism
is
the
catalytic
conversion
of
a
neutron
star
to
a
strange
star
or
the
merger
of
two
strange
stars
but
that
uses
pretty
farout
physics
my
point
is
that
we
dont
have
a
good
mechanism
at
any
distance
so
grbs
are
likely
to
be
happening
by
an
unknown
mechanism
so
we
cant
rule
out
the
oort
cloud
what
would
be
the
spectrum
of
an
event
which
converts
a
comet
to
strange
matter
the
spectra
for
primordial
black
holes
eating
comets
and
antimatter
comets
colliding
with
matter
comets
arent
quite
right
but
perhaps
there
is
an
unusual
mechanism
which
modifies
the
spectrum
the
energy
matches
very
well
for
both
of
these
mechanisms
according
to
trevor
weeks
if
the
tunguska
meteorite
was
a
miniblack
hole
collision
with
the
earth
then
there
are
likely
to
be
enough
miniblack
holes
around
that
the
rate
for
bhcomet
collisions
matches
the
grb
rate
well
the
fact
that
we
dont
know
the
distribution
of
comets
in
the
oort
cloud
isnt
a
reason
to
rule
them
out
it
makes
it
harder
to
rule
them
out
the
point
of
the
cited
paper
was
that
if
we
assume
they
got
the
right
distribution
for
the
oort
cloud
it
is
hard
but
not
impossible
to
match
that
up
with
the
distribution
of
grbs
if
they
got
the
wrong
distribution
for
the
oort
cloud
they
cant
constrain
any
oort

grbs
at
all

i
believe
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
here
the

x
three

are
focusing
instruments
that
more

less
form
an

so
positional
errors
are
limited
by
craft
attitude
and
the
resolving
power
of
the
optics
batse
is
an
altogether
different
beast
effectively
just
coincidence
counters
one
on
each
corner
of
the
craft
positional
information
is
triangulated
from
the
differential
signal
arrival
times
at
each
of
the
detectors
positional
error
would
be
predominantly
determined
by
timing
errors
and
errors
in
craft
attitude
since
none
of
the
baste
detectors
have
any
independant
angular
resolution
whatsoever
they
can
not
be
used
to
determine
parallax
indeed
parallax
would
just
add
a
very
small
component
to
the
positional
error
demonstrating
that
these
puppies
are
beyond
the
oort
cloud
would
require
resolution
on
the
order
of
arcseconds
since
the
oort
cloud
is
postulated
to
extend
to
about
parsec
all
together
now
parallax
arc
second
a
parsec
is
the
distance
of
an
object
that
demonstrates
one
arc
second
of
parallax
with
a
au
base
line
if
the
degree
accuracy
reported
above
is
true
were
going
to
have
to
add
a
baste
to
the
pluto
fast
flyby
to
get
enough
baseline
the
beauty
of
baste
is
that
it
both
gives
positional
information
and
watches
the
entire
sky
simultaneously
a
realy
handy
combination
when
you
have
no
idea

the

kevin

there
are
a

is

one
im

at
here
this
puppy
is
far

away
that
if
a
bright
burst
happens
nearby
the
huge
annulus
created
by
it
will
hopefully
intersect
the
line
or
general
circle
given
by
batse
and
we
can
get
a
moderately
accurate
position
say
oh
or
degrees
that
is
the
closest
anyone
has

my

me

the

then
we
realized
that
the

i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a

given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth
like
conditions
this
is
a
good
question
there
are
major
blind
spots
in
our
understanding
of
what
makes
the
earth
habitable
for
example
why
does
the
earths
atmosphere
have
the
concentration
of
oxygen
it
does
the
naive
answer
is
photosynthesis
but
this
is
clearly
incomplete
photosynthesis
by
itself
cant
make
the
atmosphere
oxygenated
as
the
oxygen
produced
is
consumed
when
the
plants
decay
or
are
eaten
what
is
needed
is
photosynthesis
plus
some
mechanism
to
sequester
some
fraction
of
the
resulting
reduced
material
on
earth
this
mechanism
is
burial
in
seafloor
sediments
of
organic
matter
mostly
from
oceanic
sources
however
this
burial
requires
continental
sediments
in
the
deep
ocean
the
burial
rate
is
so
slow
that
most
material
is
consumed
before
it
can
be
sequestered
this
suggests
that
a
planet
without
large
oceans
or
a
planet
without
continents
undergoing
weathering
will
have
a
hard
time
accumulating
an
oxygen
atmosphere
in
particular
an
allocean
planet
may
have
a
hard
time
supporting
an
oxygen
atmosphere
there
is
also
the
problem
of
why
the
oxygen
in
the
earths
atmosphere
has
been
relatively
stable
over
geological
time
for
a
period
at
least
orders
of
magnitude
longer
than
the
decay
time
of
atmospheric
to
weathering
in
the
absence
of
replenishment
no
convincing
feedback
mechanism
has
been
identified
perhaps
the
reason
is
the
weak
anthropic
principle
if
during
the
last
myr
or
so
the
oxygen
level
had
dropped
too
low
we
wouldnt
be
here

this
text
is
a
history
of
the
spaceship
as
both
a
cultural
and
a
technological
phenomenon
the
idea
of
a
vehicle
for
traversing
the
space
betwen
worlds
did
not
spring
fullblown
into
existence
in
the
tlatter
half
of
theis
century
the
need
preceded
the
ability
ot
make
such
a
device
by
several
hundred
years
as
soon
as
it
was
realized
that
there
were
other
worlds
than
this
one
human
beings
wanted
to
reach
them
tracing
the
history
of
the
many
imaginative
and
often
prescient
attempts
to
solve
this
problem
also
reflects
the
history
of
technology
science
astronomy
and
engineering
once
space
travel
became
feasible
there
were
many
more
spacecraft
concepts
developed
than
ever
got
off
the
drawing
board
or
off
the
ground
for
that
matter
these
also
are
described
in
theis
book
for
the
same
reason
as
the
prespaceage
and
preflight
ideas
are
they
are
all
accurate
reflections
of
their
particular
eras
dreams
abilities
and
knowledge
virtually
every
spaceship
concept
invented
since
as
well
as
selected
events
important
in
developing
the
idea
of
extraterrestrial
travel
is
listed
chronologically
the
chronological
entries
allow
comparisons
between
actual
astronautical
events
and
speculative
ventures
they
also
allow
comparisons
between
simultaneous
events
taking
place
in
different
countries
they
reveal
connections
influences
and
evolutions
hitherto
unsuspected
every
entry
is
accompanied
by
at
least
one
illustration
nearly
every
spacecraft
concept
is
illustrated
with
a
schematic
drawing
this
allows
accurate
comparisons
to
be
made
between
designss
to
visualize
differences
similarities
and
influences
this

will
be
of
interest
to
students
of

my

were
talking
the

about
putting
just
one

of

then
we
realized
that
the

alone

only
carrying
something

pounds

well
a

needs
lead

alone
weighs
about
pounds

actually
the

is
even
worse

that
the

is
only
pounds
and
most
of
that
is

the

is
maybe
of
that
i
dont
think
a

will
fit
actually
would
you
need

my
understanding
is
that
its
mostly
there
to
give
the

some
directionality
no
point
in

that
if
youve
only

the

havent

indeed
they

the
possibility
that
they

something
on

one
that

you

this

all

can

can

the
general
public
around

the
document
would
scientifically
analyze
the
technical
aspects
of
long

human
habitation
in

i
believe
that
if
any
longterm
space
exploration
program
is
to
succeed
we
need
to
basically
learn
how
to
engineer
our
own
microworld
ie
the

only
through
the
careful
analyses
of
engineering
chemical
biological
and
medical
factors
will
a
good
ecosystem
be
created
to

i
would

opinions
regarding
the
most
objective
methods
to
analyze
the

scientific
literature
for
technologies
which
can

applied
to

such
a
detailed

search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselves
as

advocates

clearly
important
to

given
that
fact
and
the

attitude
knowledge
of

we
might
be
able
to
figure
out
how

batse
can
determine
the
location
rotational
of
a

for
the
other
three
instruments
give
accuracies
on
the
order
of
fractions
of
a
degree
if
thats
any
help
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
here
the
other
x
three
instruments
are
focusing
instruments
that
more
or
less
form
an
image
so
positional
errors
are
limited
by
craft
attitude
and
the
resolving
power
of
the
optics
batse
is
an
altogether
different
beast
effectively
just
coincidence
counters
one
on
each
corner
of
the
craft
positional
information
is
triangulated
from
the
differential
signal
arrival
times
at
each
of
the
detectors
positional
error
would
be
predominantly
determined
by
timing
errors
and
errors
in
craft
attitude
since
none
of
the
baste
detectors
have
any
independant
angular
resolution
whatsoever
they
can
not
be
used
to
determine
parallax
indeed
parallax
would
just
add
a
very
small
component
to
the
positional
error
demonstrating
that
these
puppies
are
beyond
the
oort
cloud
would
require
resolution
on
the
order
of
arcseconds
since
the
oort
cloud
is
postulated
to
extend
to
about
parsec
all
together
now
parallax
arc
second
a
parsec
is
the
distance
of
an
object
that
demonstrates
one
arc
second
of
parallax
with
a
au
base
line
if
the
degree
accuracy
reported
above
is
true
were
going
to
have
to
add
a
baste
to
the
pluto
fast
flyby
to
get
enough
baseline
the
beauty
of
baste
is
that
it
both
gives
positional
information
and
watches
the
entire

realy
handy
combination

we
use
the

of

the
batse
catalogue
up
to
march
and
the
catalogue
of
cometary

by

the

direction
reflect
at

to

true
variations
in
the
column
density
of
the

we
also
apply
the

test
to
both

we
have
performed
a
variety
of
statistical
tests
a
kolmogorovsmirnov
test
for
the

in
galactic
latitude
a
test
for
the
spherical
multiple
moments
and
a
crosscorrelation
analysis
including
testing
subsamples
for
isolating
the
effect
of
possible
observational
biases
these
tests
imply
that
it
is
unlikely
that
the
two
distributions
agree
but
the
statistical
significance
is
not
sufficient
for
ruling
out
any
connection
with
complete
confidence
we
performed
montecarlo
simulations
which
show
that
only
when
the
number
of
bursts
exceeds
sim
it
is
possible
to
rule
out
a
correlation
between
the
angular
distributions
currently
it
is
only
the
combination
of
these
tests
with
the
large
disagreement
found
for
the

makes

the

distributed
as

and
pholus
are
all
about
the

mass
and
he
identifies
this
group
as
oneaccretiondown
from
the
larger
bodies
of
triton
and
plutocharon
plutocharon
he
thinks
formed
when
an
impacting
body
hit
protopluto
knocking
some
material
into
a
ring
around
pluto
which
later
accreted
in
charon
similar
to
ideas
about
the
formation
of
earths
moon
there
is
good
evidence
from
spectra
that
the
surfaces
of
pluto
and
charon
are
very
different
pluto
has
methane
frost
charon
doesnt
which
can
be
used
as
evidence
for
the
impact
theory
he
believes
that
there
may
be
around
plutotochironsized
objects
remaining
in
a
relatively
stable
dynamical
zone
just
outside
neptunes
orbit
beyond
au
or
so
and
fw
are
the
first
members
of
this
population
to
be
found
in
his
model
note
that
such
bodies
will
be
very
dark
since
if
their
surfaces
are
covered
with
methane
frost
it
will
have
photolyzed
into
very
dark
longchain
hydrocarbons
by
now
the
reason
that
pluto
has
such
a
high
albedo
around
i
think
is
that
its
surface
warms
up
just
enough
around
perihelion
to
sublimate
and
when
the
atmosphere
freezes
out
again
thirty
years
later
it
forms
bright
new
frost
so
any
bodies
much
farther
away
than
au
are
going
to
be
very
hard
to
see
i
hope
i
havent
made
any
errors

you

its
undoubtedly
mine
not

by

hes
one
of
the
top
guns
behind
the
pluto
fast
flyby
mission
i
think
and
said
that
the
current
plans
are
to
use
a
titan
to
send
the
probe
on
just
about
a
rectilinear
trajectory
to
pluto
we
were
speaking
loosely
at
the
time
hed
like
to
use
a
proton
which
gives
a
slightly
smaller
velocity
but
costs
much
less
his
figures
million
for
titan
launches
there
will
be
two
separate
probes
launched
separately
or
million
for
proton
launches
he
told
a
story
about
how
the
soviets
originally
offered
to
sell
proton

for
million
each
but
were
forced
to

having
read
in

past
about
the

i
had
assumed
that
the

had
that
sort
of
function
however
i
always
find
disturbing
the
oxymoron
of
a
noop
command
that
does
something
if
the
command
changes
the
behavior
or
status
of
the
spacecraft
it
is
not
a

command
of
course
this
terminology
comes
from
a
jet

laboratory
which
has
nothing
to
do
with

i
dont
know
where
you
got
this
idea
from
jpls
history
dates
back
to
to
the
when
a
caltech
professor
named
von
karman
conducted
experiments
in
rocket
propulsion
with
a
group
of
graduate
students
on
the
present

of

laboratory
the
army
started
funding
the
laboratory
and
had
jurisdiction
untill
the
late
when
nasa
took
over
the
early
research
conducted
at
the
laboratory
led
to
many
applications
the
first
being

i
think

mode

there
is
another
consideration
that
hasnt

yet
i
expect
that
retrieving

would
involve
damaging
it
considerably
in

to
return
it
to
its

in
the

most
of
the

items
antennas
and
especially
the

probably
are
not
retractable
into
their
fully
stowed
position
even
by

they
would
have
to
be
removed
by
the

the
only
advantage
that
this
might
yield
is
that
we
could
put

i
also
expect
that
as

the
landing

is
a
big
issue
but
that
the

are

less

can
the

doesnt

even
curious

i
disagree
it
think
the

is

but
sees
it
as
an
elitist
activity
not
one
which
he
is
ever
going
to
participate
in
all
of
us
in
our
own
way
can
contribute
to
a
comprehensive
document
which
can
be
released
to
the
general
public
around
the
world
the
document
would
scientifically
analyze
the
technical
aspects
of
long
term
human
habitation
in
space
why
is
the
general
public
going
to
be
interested
in
the
technical
details
of
long
term
space
habitation
i
like
the
idea
of
the
study
but
it
should
be
released
to
other
scientists
and
engineers
who
will
be
able
to
use
it
if
you
want
a
general
public
document
youll
need
a
more
general
publication
i
believe
that
if
any
longterm
space
exploration
program
is
to
succeed
we
need
to
basically
learn
how
to
engineer
our
own
microworld
ie
the
spacecraft
only
through
the
careful
analyses
of
engineering
chemical
biological
and
medical
factors
will
a
good
ecosystem
be
created
to
facilitate
human
life
on
a
longduration
flight
as
one
working
on
controlled
ecological
life
support
systems
engineering
the
microworld
isnt
the
problem
the
problem
is
understanding
the
basic
chemical
biological
and
medical
factors
to
be
able
to
engineer
them
efficiently
for
example
the
only
way
we
know
how
to
produce
food
is
from
plants
and
animals
food
synthesis
is
not
very
far
advanced
so
we
have
to
orbit
a
farm
well
thats
obviously
not
very
efficient
so
we
use
technology
to
reduce
the
mass
and
grow
plants
hydroponically
instead
of
using
dirt
this
is
where
the
engineering
comes
in
but
new
technologies
bring
new
basic
questions
that
we
dont
have
the
answers
to
like
in
dirt
we
can
grow
tomatoes
and
lettuce
right
beside
each
other
but
in
hydroponics
it
turns
out
that
you
cant
do
that
the
lettuce
growth
is
stunted
when
its
grown
in
the
same
hydroponic
solution
as
tomatoes
so
now
you
have
to
consider
what
other
plants
are
going
to
have
similar
interactions
this
means
some
basic
applied
scientific
research
and
thats
what
needs
to
be
done
with
all
technologies
that
have
been
developed
so
far
we
also
need
to
find
out
how
they
interact
together
thats
where
we
are
now
so
i
would
like
to
see
posts
of
opinions
regarding
the
most
objective
methods
to
analyze
the
accepted
scientific
literature
for
technologies
which
can
be
applied
to
longduration
spaceflight
first
you
need
to
do
the
literature
search
there
is
a
lot
of
information
out
there
maybe
we
should
just
pick
a
specific
area
of
long
term
habitation
this
could
be
useful
especially
if
we
make
it
available
on
the
net
then
we
can
look
at
methods
of
analyzing
the
technologies
such
a
detailed
literature
search
would
be
of
interest
to
ourselves
as
space
advocates
and
clearly
important
to
existing
space
programs
in
essence
we
would
be
dividing
the
space
life
science
issues
into
various
technical
problems
which
could
be
solved
with
various
technologies
this
database
of
acceptable
solutions
to
various
problems
could
form
the
basis
of
detailed
discussions
involving
people
from
the
bionet
isunet
and
any
other
source
unless
there
is
an
unbelievable
outpouring
of
interest
on
this
on
the
net
i
think
we
should
develop
a
detailed
data
base
of
the
literature
search
first
then
if
we
accomplish
that
we
can
go
on
to
real
analysis
the
data
base
itself
could
be
useful
for
future
engineers

i
would
appreciate
any
thoughts
on
what
makes

i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a
similar
atmosphere
evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical

simply
disallow

conditions
eg
temperature
range

to
where
temp
is
purely

jonathan
jonathan
interesting
questions
some
wonder
whether
or
not
the
moon
could
have
ever
supported
an
atmosphere
id
be
interested
in
knowing
what
our
geologyenvironmental
sciences
friends
think
as
for
human
tolerances
the
best
example
of
human
endurance
in
terms
of
altitude
ie
low
atmospheric
pressure
and
lower
oxygen
partial
pressure
is
in
my
opinion
to
the
scaling
of
mt
everest
without
oxygen
assistance
this
was
accomplished
by
a
team
of
mountaineers
who
trained
at
high
altitudes
for
quite
awhile
i
think
a
few
months
and
then
were
flown
by
helicopter
from
that
training
altitude
to
the
equivalent
altitude
on
mount
everest
where
they
began
the
ascent
of
our
planets
highest
peak
without
oxygen
tanks
this
is
quite
a
feat
of
physiological
endurance
because
if
you
or
i
tried
to
go
to
feet
and
exert
ourselves
we
would
probably
pass
out
get
altitude
sick
and
could
even
die
from
cerebral
edema
so
this
is
the
limit
of
low
pressure
high
pressure
situations
would
be
limited
by
the
duration
of
time
which
it
takes
to
slowly
acclimate
to
a
higher
pressure
skin
divers
would
know
alot
about
high
pressure
situations
and
could
tell
you
about
how
they
safely
make
deep
dives
without
getting
the
bends
some
military
experiments
have
put
people
under
several
atmospheres
of
pressure
not
sure
what
the
high
limit
was
because
the
papers
arent
in
front
of
me
usually
at
a
certain
point
the
nitrogen
in
the
air
becomes
toxic
to
the
body
and
you
start
acting
idiotic
divers
call
this
nitrogen
narcosis
those
afflicted
can
do
very
dangerous
and
irrational
things
like
taking
off
a
diving
mask
and
oxygen
tank
in
order
to
talk
to
fish
at
feet
under
water
hope
any
diving
folk
can
elaborate
on
this
matter
as
i
am
not
a
diving
expert
mars
cannot
support
human
life
without
pressurization
because
the
atmosphere
is
too
thin
th
our
earths
atmospheric
density
in
addition
the
mars
atmosphere
is
mostly
carbon
dioxide
basically
you
would
need
a
pressure
suit
there
or
youd
die
from
the
low

introduction
from
our
small
world
we
have
gazed
upon
the
cosmic
ocean
for
untold
thousands
of
years
ancient
astronomers
observed
points
of
light
that
appeared
to
move
among
the
stars
they
called
these
objects
planets
meaning
wanderers
and
named
them
after
roman
deities
jupiter
king
of
the
gods
mars
the
god
of
war
mercury
messenger
of
the
gods
venus
the
god
of
love
and
beauty
and
saturn
father
of
jupiter
and
god
of
agriculture
the
stargazers
also
observed
comets
with
sparkling
tails
and
meteors
or
shooting
stars
apparently
falling
from
the
sky
science
flourished
during
the
european
renaissance
fundamental
physical
laws
governing
planetary
motion
were
discovered
and
the
orbits
of
the
planets
around
the
sun
were
calculated
in
the
century
astronomers
pointed
a
new
device
called
the
telescope
at
the
heavens
and
made
startling
discoveries
but
the
years
since
have
amounted
to
a
golden
age
of
solar
system
exploration
advancements
in
rocketry
after
world
war
ii
enabled
our
machines
to
break
the
grip
of
earths
gravity
and
travel
to
the
moon
and
to
other
planets
the
united
states
has
sent
automated
spacecraft
then
humancrewed
expeditions
to
explore
the
moon
our
automated
machines
have
orbited
and
landed
on
venus
and
mars
explored
the
suns
environment
observed
comets
and
made
closerange
surveys
while
flying
past
mercury
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
these
travelers
brought
a
quantum
leap
in
our
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
solar
system
through
the
electronic
sight
and
other
senses
of
our
automated
spacecraft
color
and
complexion
have
been
given
to
worlds
that
for
centuries
appeared
to
earthbound
eyes
as
fuzzy
disks
or
indistinct
points
of
light
and
dozens
of
previously
unknown
objects
have
been
discovered
future
historians
will
likely
view
these
pioneering
flights
through
the
solar
system
as
some
of
the
most
remarkable
achievements
of
the
century
automated
spacecraft
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administrations
nasas
automated
spacecraft
for
solar
system
exploration
come
in
many
shapes
and
sizes
while
they
are
designed
to
fulfill
separate
and
specific
mission
objectives
the
craft
share
much
in
common
each
spacecraft
consists
of
various
scientific
instruments
selected
for
a
particular
mission
supported
by
basic
subsystems
for
electrical
power
trajectory
and
orientation
control
as
well
as
for
processing
data
and
communicating
with
earth
electrical
power
is
required
to
operate
the
spacecraft
instruments
and
systems
nasa
uses
both
solar
energy
from
arrays
of
photovoltaic
cells
and
small
nuclear
generators
to
power
its
solar
system
missions
rechargeable
batteries
are
employed
for
backup
and
supplemental
power
imagine
that
a
spacecraft
has
successfully
journeyed
millions
of
miles
through
space
to
fly
but
one
time
near
a
planet
only
to
have
its
cameras
and
other
sensing
instruments
pointed
the
wrong
way
as
it
speeds
past
the
target
to
help
prevent
such
a
mishap
a
subsystem
of
small
thrusters
is
used
to
control
spacecraft
the
thrusters
are
linked
with
devices
that
maintain
a
constant
gaze
at
selected
stars
just
as
earths
early
seafarers
used
the
stars
to
navigate
the
oceans
spacecraft
use
stars
to
maintain
their
bearings
in
space
with
the
subsystem
locked
onto
fixed
points
of
reference
flight
controllers
can
keep
a
spacecrafts
scientific
instruments
pointed
at
the
target
body
and
the
crafts
communications
antennas
pointed
toward
earth
the
thrusters
can
also
be
used
to
finetune
the
flight
path
and
speed
of
the
spacecraft
to
ensure
that
a
target
body
is
encountered
at
the
planned
distance
and
on
the
proper
trajectory
between
and
nasa
spacecraft
were
dispatched
to
study
the
moon
and
the
solar
environment
they
also
scanned
the
inner
planets
other
than
earth
mercury
venus
and
mars
these
three
worlds
and
our
own
are
known
as
the
terrestrial
planets
because
they
share
a
solidrock
composition
for
the
early
planetary
reconnaissance
missions
nasa
employed
a
highly
successful
series
of
spacecraft
called
the
mariners
their
flights
helped
shape
the
planning
of
later
missions
between
and
seven
mariner
missions
conducted
the
first
surveys
of
our
planetary
neighbors
in
space
all
of
the
mariners
used
solar
panels
as
their
primary
power
source
the
first
and
the
final
versions
of
the
spacecraft
had
two
wings
covered
with
photovoltaic
cells
other
mariners
were
equipped
with
four
solar
panels
extending
from
their
octagonal
bodies
although
the
mariners
ranged
from
the
mariner
venus
spacecraft
weighing
in
at
kilograms
pounds
to
the
mariner
mars
orbiter
weighing
in
at
kilograms
pounds
their
basic
design
remained
quite
similar
throughout
the
program
the
mariner
venus
spacecraft
for
example
had
originally
been
a
backup
for
the
mariner
mars
flyby
the
mariner
spacecraft
sent
to
venus
and
mercury
used
components
left
over
from
the
mariner
mars
orbiter
program
in
nasa
launched
pioneer
a
jupiter
spacecraft
interest
was
shifting
to
four
of
the
outer
planets
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
giant
balls
of
dense
gas
quite
different
from
the
terrestrial
worlds
we
had
already
surveyed
four
nasa
spacecraft
in
all
two
pioneers
and
two
voyagers
were
sent
in
the
to
tour
the
outer
regions
of
our
solar
system
because
of
the
distances
involved
these
travelers
took
anywhere
from
months
to
years
to
reach
their
destinations
barring
faster
spacecraft
they
will
eventually
become
the
first
human
artifacts
to
journey
to
distant
stars
because
the
suns
light
becomes
so
faint
in
the
outer
solar
system
these
travelers
do
not
use
solar
power
but
instead
operate
on
electricity
generated
by
heat
from
the
decay
of
radioisotopes
nasa
also
developed
highly
specialized
spacecraft
to
revisit
our
neighbors
mars
and
venus
in
the
middle
and
late
twin
viking
landers
were
equipped
to
serve
as
seismic
and
weather
stations
and
as
biology
laboratories
two
advanced
orbiters
descendants
of
the
mariner
craft
carried
the
viking
landers
from
earth
and
then
studied
martian
features
from
above
two
drumshaped
pioneer
spacecraft
visited
venus
in
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
was
equipped
with
a
radar
instrument
that
allowed
it
to
see
through
the
planets
dense
cloud
cover
to
study
surface
features
the
pioneer
venus
multiprobe
carried
four
probes
that
were
dropped
through
the
clouds
the
probes
and
the
main
body
all
of
which
contained
scientific
instruments
radioed
information
about
the
planets
atmosphere
during
their
descent
toward
the
surface
a
new
generation
of
automated
spacecraft
including
magellan
galileo
ulysses
mars
observer
the
comet
rendezvousasteroid
flyby
craf
and
cassini
is
being
developed
and
sent
out
into
the
solar
system
to
make
detailed
examinations
that
will
increase
our
understanding
of
our
neighborhood
and
our
own
planet
the
sun
a
discussion
of
the
objects
in
the
solar
system
must
start
with
the
sun
the
sun
dwarfs
the
other
bodies
representing
approximately
percent
of
all
the
mass
in
the
solar
system
all
of
the
planets
moons
asteroids
comets
dust
and
gas
add
up
to
only
about
percent
this
percent
represents
the
material
left
over
from
the
suns
formation
one
hundred
and
nine
earths
would
be
required
to
fit
across
the
suns
disk
and
its
interior
could
hold
over
million
earths
as
a
star
the
sun
generates
energy
through
the
process
of
fusion
the
temperature
at
the
suns
core
is
million
degrees
celsius
million
degrees
fahrenheit
and
the
pressure
there
is
billion
times
earths
air
pressure
at
sea
level
the
suns
surface
temperature
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
seems
almost
chilly
compared
to
its
coretemperature
at
the
solar
core
hydrogen
can
fuse
into
helium
producing
energy
the
sun
also
produces
a
strong
magnetic
field
and
streams
of
charged
particles
both
extending
far
beyond
the
planets
the
sun
appears
to
have
been
active
for
billion
years
and
has
enough
fuel
to
go
on
for
another
five
billion
years
or
so
at
the
end
of
its
life
the
sun
will
start
to
fuse
helium
into
heavier
elements
and
begin
to
swell
up
ultimately
growing
so
large
that
it
will
swallow
earth
after
a
billion
years
as
a
red
giant
it
will
suddenly
collapse
into
a
white
dwarf
the
final
end
product
of
a
star
like
ours
it
may
take
a
trillion
years
to
cool
off
completely
many
spacecraft
have
explored
the
suns
environment
but
none
have
gotten
any
closer
to
its
surface
than
approximately
twothirds
of
the
distance
from
earth
to
the
sun
pioneers
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
voyagers
and
and
other
spacecraft
have
all
sampled
the
solar
environment
the
ulysses
spacecraft
launched
on
october
is
a
joint
solar
mission
of
nasa
and
the
european
space
agency
after
using
jupiters
gravity
to
change
its
trajectory
ulysses
will
fly
over
the
suns
polar
regions
during
and
and
will
perform
a
wide
range
of
studies
using
nine
onboard
scientific
instruments
we
are
fortunate
that
the
sun
is
exactly
the
way
it
is
if
it
were
different
in
almost
any
way
life
would
almost
certainly
never
have
developed
on
earth
mercury
obtaining
the
first
closeup
views
of
mercury
was
the
primary
objective
of
the
mariner
spacecraft
launched
on
november
from
kennedy
space
center
in
florida
after
a
journey
of
nearly
five
months
which
included
a
flyby
of
venus
the
spacecraft
passed
within
kilometers
miles
of
the
solar
systems
innermost
planet
on
march
until
mariner
little
was
known
about
mercury
even
the
best
telescopic
views
from
earth
showed
mercury
as
an
indistinct
object
lacking
any
surface
detail
the
planet
is
so
close
to
the
sun
that
it
is
usually
lost
in
solar
glare
when
the
planet
is
visible
on
earths
horizon
just
after
sunset
or
before
dawn
it
is
obscured
by
the
haze
and
dust
in
our
atmosphere
only
radar
telescopes
gave
any
hint
of
mercurys
surface
conditions
prior
to
the
voyage
of
mariner
the
photographs
mariner
radioed
back
to
earth
revealed
an
ancient
heavily
cratered
surface
closely
resembling
our
own
moon
the
pictures
also
showed
huge
cliffs
crisscrossing
the
planet
these
apparently
were
created
when
mercurys
interior
cooled
and
shrank
buckling
the
planets
crust
the
cliffs
are
as
high
as
kilometers
miles
and
as
long
as
kilometers
miles
instruments
on
mariner
discovered
that
mercury
has
a
weak
magnetic
field
and
a
trace
of
atmosphere
a
trillionth
the
density
of
earths
atmosphere
and
composed
chiefly
of
argon
neon
and
helium
when
the
planets
orbit
takes
it
closest
to
the
sun
surface
temperatures
range
from
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
on
mercurys
sunlit
side
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
on
the
dark
side
this
range
in
surface
temperature
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
is
the
largest
for
a
single
body
in
the
solar
system
mercury
literally
bakes
and
freezes
at
the
same
time
days
and
nights
are
long
on
mercury
the
combination
of
a
slow
rotation
relative
to
the
stars
earth
days
and
a
rapid
revolution
around
the
sun
earth
days
means
that
one
mercury
solar
day
takes
earth
days
or
two
mercury
years
the
time
it
takes
the
innermost
planet
to
complete
two
orbits
around
the
sun
mercury
appears
to
have
a
crust
of
light
silicate
rock
like
that
of
earth
scientists
believe
mercury
has
a
heavy
ironrich
core
making
up
slightly
less
than
half
of
its
volume
that
would
make
mercurys
core
larger
proportionally
than
the
moons
core
or
those
of
any
of
the
planets
after
the
initial
mercury
encounter
mariner
made
two
additional
flybys
on
september
and
march
before
control
gas
used
to
orient
the
spacecraft
was
exhausted
and
the
mission
was
concluded
each
flyby
took
place
at
the
same
local
mercury
time
when
the
identical
half
of
the
planet
was
illuminated
as
a
result
we
still
have
not
seen
onehalf
of
the
planets
surface
venus
veiled
by
dense
cloud
cover
venus
our
nearest
planetary
neighbor
was
the
first
planet
to
be
explored
the
mariner
spacecraft
launched
on
august
was
the
first
of
more
than
a
dozen
successful
american
and
soviet
missions
to
study
the
mysterious
planet
as
spacecraft
flew
by
or
orbited
venus
plunged
into
the
atmosphere
or
gently
landed
on
venus
surface
romantic
myths
and
speculations
about
our
neighbor
were
laid
to
rest
on
december
mariner
passed
within
kilometers
miles
of
venus
and
became
the
first
spacecraft
to
scan
another
planet
onboard
instruments
measured
venus
for
minutes
mariner
launched
in
june
flew
much
closer
to
the
planet
passing
within
kilometers
miles
of
venus
on
the
second
american
flyby
mariner
instruments
measured
the
planets
magnetic
field
ionosphere
radiation
belts
and
temperatures
on
its
way
to
mercury
mariner
flew
by
venus
and
transmitted
ultraviolet
pictures
to
earth
showing
cloud
circulation
patterns
in
the
venusian
atmosphere
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
two
spacecraft
were
launched
to
further
unravel
the
mysteries
of
venus
on
december
of
the
same
year
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
became
the
first
spacecraft
placed
in
orbit
around
the
planet
five
days
later
the
five
separate
components
making
up
the
second
spacecraft
the
pioneer
venus
multiprobe
entered
the
venusian
atmosphere
at
different
locations
above
the
planet
the
four
small
independent
probes
and
the
main
body
radioed
atmospheric
data
back
to
earth
during
their
descent
toward
the
surface
although
designed
to
examine
the
atmosphere
one
of
the
probes
survived
its
impact
with
the
surface
and
continued
to
transmit
data
for
another
hour
venus
resembles
earth
in
size
physical
composition
and
density
more
closely
than
any
other
known
planet
however
spacecraft
have
discovered
significant
differences
as
well
for
example
venus
rotation
west
to
east
is
retrograde
backward
compared
to
the
easttowest
spin
of
earth
and
most
of
the
other
planets
approximately
percent
of
venus
atmosphere
times
as
dense
as
earths
is
carbon
dioxide
the
principal
constituent
of
earths
atmosphere
is
nitrogen
venus
atmosphere
acts
like
a
greenhouse
permitting
solar
radiation
to
reach
the
surface
but
trapping
the
heat
that
would
ordinarily
be
radiated
back
into
space
as
a
result
the
planets
average
surface
temperature
is
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
hot
enough
to
melt
lead
a
radio
altimeter
on
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
provided
the
first
means
of
seeing
through
the
planets
dense
cloud
cover
and
determining
surface
features
over
almost
the
entire
planet
nasas
magellan
spacecraft
launched
on

has
been
in
orbit
around
venus
since
august
the
spacecraft
uses
radarmapping
techniques
to
provide
ultrahighresolution
images
of
the
surface
magellan
has
revealed
a
landscape
dominated
by
volcanic
features
faults
and
impact
craters
huge
areas
of
the
surface
show
evidence
of
multiple
periods
of

almost
all

are
named
for
women
maxwell
montes
alpha
regio
and
beta
regio
are
the
exceptions
craters
survive
on
venus
for
perhaps
million
years
because
there
is
no
water
and
very
little
wind
erosion
extensive
faultline
networks
cover
the
planet
probably
the
result
of
the
same
crustal
flexing
that
produces
plate
tectonics
on
earth
but
on
venus
the
surface
temperature
is
sufficient
to
weaken
the
rock
which
cracks
just
about
everywhere
preventing
the
formation
of
major
plates
and
large
earthquake
faults
like
the
san
andreas
fault
in
california
venus
predominant
weather
pattern
is
a
highaltitude
highspeed
circulation
of
clouds
that
contain
sulfuric
acid
at
speeds
reaching
as
high
as
kilometers
miles
per
hour
the
clouds
circle
the
planet
in
only
four
earth
days
the
circulation
is
in
the
same
direction
west
to
east
as
venus
slow
rotation
of
earth
days
whereas
earths
winds
blow
in
both
directions
west
to

serves
as
a
simplified
laboratory
for
the

all
of
the
harmful
radiation
coming
from
the
sun
and
other
stars
earths
atmosphere
protects
us
from
meteors
as
well
most
of
which
burn
up
before
they
can
strike
the
surface
active
geological
processes
have
left
no
evidence
of
the
pelting
earth
almost
certainly
received
soon
after
it
formed
about
billion
years
ago
along
with
the
other
newly
formed
planets
it
was
showered
by
space
debris
in
the
early
days
of
the
solar
system
from
our
journeys
into
space
we
have
learned
much
about
our
home
planet
the
first
american
satellite
explorer
was
launched
from
cape
canaveral
in
florida
on
january
and
discovered
an
intense
radiation
zone
now
called
the
van
allen
radiation
belts
surrounding
earth
since
then
other
research
satellites
have
revealed
that
our
planets
magnetic
field
is
distorted
into
a
teardrop
shape
by
the
solar
wind
the
stream
of
charged
particles
continuously
ejected
from
the
sun
weve
learned
that
the
magnetic
field
does
not
fade
off
into
space
but
has
definite
boundaries
and
we
now
know
that
our
wispy
upper
atmosphere
once
believed
calm
and
uneventful
seethes
with
activity
swelling
by
day
and
contracting
by
night
affected
by
changes
in
solar
activity
the
upper
atmosphere
contributes
to
weather
and
climate
on
earth
besides
affecting
earths
weather
solar
activity
gives
rise
to
a
dramatic
visual
phenomenon
in
our
atmosphere
when
charged
particles
from
the
solar
wind
become
trapped
in
earths
magnetic
field
they
collide
with
air
molecules
above
our
planets
magnetic
poles
these
air
molecules
then
begin
to
glow
and
are
known
as
the
auroras
or
the
northern
and
southern
lights
satellites
about
kilometers
miles
out
in
space
play
a
major
role
in
daily
local
weather
forecasting
these
watchful
electronic
eyes
warn
us
of
dangerous
storms
continuous
global
monitoring
provides
a
vast
amount
of
useful
data
and
contributes
to
a
better
understanding
of
earths
complex
weather
systems
from
their
unique
vantage
points
satellites
can
survey
earths
oceans
land
use
and
resources
and
monitor
the
planets
health
these
eyes
in
space
have
saved
countless
lives
provided
tremendous
conveniences
and
shown
us
that
we
may
be
altering
our
planet
in
dangerous
ways
the
moon
the
moon
is
earths
single
natural
satellite
the
first
human
footsteps
on
an
alien
world
were
made
by
american
astronauts
on
the
dusty
surface
of
our
airless
lifeless
companion
in
preparation
for
the
humancrewed
apollo
expeditions
nasa
dispatched
the
automated
ranger
surveyor
and
lunar
orbiter
spacecraft
to
study
the

between
and
nasas
apollo
program
left
a
large
legacy
of
lunar
materials
and
data
six
twoastronaut
crews
landed
on
and
explored
the
lunar
surface
between
and
carrying
back
a
collection
of
rocks
and
soil
weighing
a
total
of
kilograms
pounds
and
consisting
of
more
than
separate
samples
from
this
material
and
other
studies
scientists
have
constructed
a
history
of
the
moon
that
includes
its
infancy
rocks
collected
from
the
lunar
highlands
date
to
about
billion
years
old
the
first
few
million
years
of
the
moons
existence
were
so
violent
that
few
traces
of
this
period
remain
as
a
molten
outer
layer
gradually
cooled
and
solidified
into
different
kinds
of
rock
the
moon
was
bombarded
by
huge
asteroids
and
smaller
objects
some
of
the
asteroids
were
as
large
as
rhode
island
or
delaware
and
their
collisions
with
the
moon
created
basins
hundreds
of
kilometers
across
this
catastrophic
bombardment
tapered
off
approximately
four
billion
years
ago
leaving
the
lunar
highlands
covered
with
huge
overlapping
craters
and
a
deep
layer
of
shattered
and
broken
rock
heat
produced
by
the
decay
of
radioactive
elements
began
to
melt
the
interior
of
the
moon
at
depths
of
about
kilometers
miles
below
the
surface
then
for
the
next
million
years
from
about
to
billion
years
ago
lava
rose
from
inside
the
moon
the
lava
gradually
spread
out
over
the
surface
flooding
the
large
impact
basins
to
form
the
dark
areas
that
galileo
galilei
an
astronomer
of
the
italian
renaissance
called
maria
meaning
seas
as
far
as
we
can
tell
there
has
been
no
significant
volcanic
activity
on
the
moon
for
more
than
three
billion
years
since
then
the
lunar
surface
has
been
altered
only
by
micrometeorites
by
the
atomic
particles
from
the
sun
and
stars
by
the
rare
impacts
of
large
meteorites
and
by
spacecraft
and
astronauts
if
our
astronauts
had
landed
on
the
moon
a
billion
years
ago
they
would
have
seen
a
landscape
very
similar
to
the
one
today
thousands
of
years
from
now
the
footsteps
left
by
the
apollo
crews
will
remain
sharp
and
clear
the
origin
of
the
moon
is
still
a
mystery
four
theories
attempt
an
explanation
the
moon
formed
near
earth
as
a
separate
body
it
was
torn
from
earth
it
formed
somewhere
else
and
was
captured
by
our
planets
gravity
or
it
was
the
result
of
a
collision
between
earth
and
an
asteroid
about
the
size
of
mars
the
last
theory
has
some
good
support
but
is
far
from
certain
mars
of
all
the
planets
mars
has
long
been
considered
the
solar
systems
prime
candidate
for
harboring
extraterrestrial
life
astronomers
studying
the
red
planet
through
telescopes
saw
what
appeared
to
be
straight
lines
crisscrossing
its
surface
these
observations
later
determined
to
be
optical
illusions
led
to
the
popular
notion
that
intelligent
beings
had
constructed
a
system
of
irrigation
canals
on
the
planet
in
when
orson
welles
broadcast
a
radio
drama
based
on
the
science
fiction
classic
war
of
the
worlds
by
hg
wells
enough
people
believed
in
the
tale
of
invading
martians
to
cause
a
near
panic
another
reason
for
scientists
to
expect
life
on
mars
had
to
do
with
the
apparent
seasonal
color
changes
on
the
planets
surface
this
phenomenon
led
to
speculation
that
conditions
might
support
a
bloom
of
martian
vegetation
during
the
warmer
months
and
cause
plant
life
to
become
dormant
during
colder
periods
so
far
six
american
missions
to
mars
have
been
carried
out
four
mariner
spacecraft
three
flying
by
the
planet
and
one
placed
into
martian
orbit
surveyed
the
planet
extensively
before
the
viking
orbiters
and

coming
within

found
many

and
naturally
occurring

but
no

of
artificial

or
flowing

mariners
and
followed
with
their
flybys
during
the
summer
of
and
returned
pictures
mariners
and
showed
a
diversity
of
surface
conditions
as
well
as
a
thin
cold
dry
atmosphere
of
carbon
dioxide
on
may
the
mariner
orbiter
was
launched
on
a
mission
to
make
a
yearlong
study
of
the
martian
surface
the
spacecraft
arrived
five
and
a
half
months
after
liftoff
only
to
find
mars
in
the
midst
of
a
planetwide
dust
storm
that
made
surface
photography
impossible
for
several
weeks
but
after
the
storm
cleared
mariner
began
returning
the
first
of
pictures
these
revealed
previously
unknown
martian
features
including
evidence
that
large
amounts
of
water
once
flowed
across
the
surface
etching
river
valleys
and
flood
plains
in
august
and
september
the
viking
and
spacecraft
each
consisting
of
an
orbiter
and
a
lander
lifted
off
from
kennedy
space
center
the
mission
was
designed
to
answer
several
questions
about
the
red
planet
including
is
there
life
there
nobody
expected
the
spacecraft
to
spot
martian
cities
but
it
was
hoped
that
the
biology
experiments
on
the
viking
landers
would
at
least
find
evidence
of
primitive
life
past
or
present
viking
lander
became
the
first
spacecraft
to
successfully
touch
down
on
another
planet
when
it
landed
on
july
while
the
united
states
was
celebrating
its
bicentennial
photos
sent
back
from
the
chryse
planitia
plains
of
gold
showed
a
bleak
rustyred
landscape
panoramic
images
returned
by
the
lander
revealed
a
rolling
plain
littered
with
rocks
and
marked
by
rippled
sand
dunes
fine
red
dust
from
the
martian
soil
gives
the
sky
a
salmon
hue
when
viking
lander
touched
down
on
utopia
planitia
on
september
it
viewed
a
more
rolling
landscape
than
the
one
seen
by
its
predecessor
one
without
visible
dunes
the
results
sent
back
by
the
laboratory
on
each
viking
lander
were
inconclusive
small
samples
of
the
red
martian
soil
were
tested
in
three
different
experiments
designed
to
detect
biological
processes
while
some
of
the
test
results
seemed
to
indicate
biological
activity
later
analysis
confirmed
that
this
activity
was
inorganic
in
nature
and
related
to
the
planets
soil
chemistry
is
there
life
on
mars
no
one
knows
for
sure
but
the
viking
mission
found
no
evidence
that
organic
molecules
exist
there
the
viking
landers
became
weather
stations
recording
wind
velocity
and
direction
as
well
as
atmospheric
temperature
and
pressure
few
weather
changes
were
observed
the
highest
temperature
recorded
by
either
craft
was
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
at
the
viking
lander
site
in
midsummer
the
lowest
temperature
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
was
recorded
at
the
more
northerly
viking
lander
site
during
winter
nearhurricane
wind
speeds
were
measured
at
the
two
martian
weather
stations
during
global
dust
storms
but
because
the
atmosphere
is
so
thin
wind
force
is
minimal
viking
lander
photographed
light
patches
of
frost
probably
waterice
during
its
second
winter
on
the
planet
the
martian
atmosphere
like
that
of
venus
is
primarily
carbon
dioxide
nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
present
only
in
small
percentages
martian
air
contains
only
about
as
much
water
as
our
air
but
even
this
small
amount
can
condense
out
forming
clouds
that
ride
high
in
the
atmosphere
or
swirl
around
the
slopes
of
towering
volcanoes
local
patches
of
early
morning
fog
can
form
in
valleys
there
is
evidence
that
in
the
past
a
denser
martian
atmosphere
may
have
allowed
water
to
flow
on
the
planet
physical
features
closely
resembling
shorelines
gorges
riverbeds
and
islands
suggest
that
great
rivers
once
marked
the
planet
mars
has
two
moons
phobos
and
deimos
they
are
small
and
irregularly
shaped
and
possess
ancient
cratered
surfaces
it
is
possible
the
moons
were
originally
asteroids
that
ventured
too
close
to
mars
and
were
captured
by
its
gravity
the
viking
orbiters
and
landers
exceeded
by
large
margins
their
design
lifetimes
of
and
days
respectively
the
first
to
fail
was
viking
orbiter
which
stopped
operating
on
july
when
a
leak
depleted
its
attitudecontrol
gas
viking
lander
operated
until
april
when
it
was
shut
down
because
of
battery
degeneration
viking
orbiter
quit
on
august
when
the
last
of
its
attitudecontrol
gas
was
used
up
viking
lander
ceased
functioning
on
november
despite
the
inconclusive
results
of
the
viking
biology
experiments
we
know
more
about
mars
than
any
other
planet
except
earth
nasas
mars
observer
spacecraft
to
be
launched
in
september
will
expand
our
knowledge
of
the
martian
environment
and
lead
to
human
exploration
of
the
red
planet
asteroids
the
solar
system
has
a
large
number
of
rocky
and
metallic
objects
that
are
in
orbit
around
the
sun
but
are
too
small
to
be
considered
fullfledged
planets
these
objects
are
known
as
asteroids
or
minor
planets
most
but
not
all
are
found
in
a
band
or
belt
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
some
have
orbits
that
cross
earths
path
and
there
is
evidence
that
earth
has
been
hit
by
asteroids
in
the
past
one
of
the
least
eroded
best
preserved
examples
is
the
barringer
meteor
crater
near
winslow
arizona
asteroids
are
material
left
over
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
one
theory
suggests
that
they
are
the
remains
of
a
planet
that
was
destroyed
in
a
massive
collision
long
ago
more
likely
asteroids
are
material
that
never
coalesced
into
a
planet
in
fact
if
the
estimated
total
mass
of
all
asteroids
was
gathered
into
a
single
object
the
object
would
be
only
about
kilometers
miles
across
less
than
half
the
diameter
of
our
moon
thousands
of
asteroids
have
been
identified
from
earth
it
is
estimated
that
are
bright
enough
to
eventually
be
photographed
through
earthbased
telescopes
much
of
our
understanding
about
asteroids
comes
from
examining
pieces
of
space
debris
that
fall
to
the
surface
of
earth
asteroids
that
are
on
a
collision
course
with
earth
are
called
meteoroids
when
a
meteoroid
strikes
our
atmosphere
at
high
velocity
friction
causes
this
chunk
of
space
matter
to
incinerate
in
a
streak
of
light
known
as
a
meteor
if
the
meteoroid
does
not
burn
up
completely
whats
left
strikes
earths
surface
and
is
called
a
meteorite
one
of
the
best
places
to
look
for
meteorites
is
the
ice
cap
of
antarctica
of
all
the
meteorites
examined
percent
are
composed
of
silicate
stone
and
percent
are
composed
of
iron
and
nickel
the
rest
are
a
mixture
of
the
three
materials
stony
meteorites
are
the
hardest
to
identify
since
they
look
very
much
like
terrestrial
rocks
since
asteroids
are
material
from
the
very
early
solar
system
scientists
are
interested
in
their
composition
spacecraft
that
have
flown
through
the
asteroid
belt
have
found
that
the
belt
is
really
quite
empty
and
that
asteroids
are
separated
by
very
large
distances
current
and
future
missions
will
fly
by
selected
asteroids
for
closer
examination

sulfur

react
to
form
organic
molecules
in
the
regions
between
the

frigid
cloud
tops
and
the
warmer

however
these

are
probably
shortlived
the

exploring
in
detail
what
the
two
pioneers
and
two
voyagers
revealed
galilean
satellites
in
galileo
galilei
aimed
his
telescope
at
jupiter
and
spotted
four
points
of
light
orbiting
the
planet
for
the
first
time
humans
had
seen
the
moons
of
another
world
in
honor
of
their
discoverer
these
four
bodies
would
become
known
as
the
galilean
satellites
or
moons
but
galileo
might
have
happily
traded
this
honor
for
one
look
at
the
dazzling
photographs
returned
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
as
they
flew
past
these
planetsized
satellites
one
of
the
most
remarkable
findings
of
the
voyager
mission
was
the
presence
of
active
volcanoes
on
the
galilean
moon
io
volcanic
eruptions
had
never
before
been
observed
on
a
world
other
than
earth
the
voyager
cameras
identified
at
least
nine
active
volcanoes
on
io
with
plumes
of
ejected
material
extending
as
far
as
kilometers
miles
above
the
moons
surface
ios
pizzacolored
terrain
marked
by
orange
and
yellow
hues
is
probably
the
result
of
sulfurrich
materials
brought
to
the
surface
by
volcanic
activity
volcanic
activity
on
this
satellite
is
the
result
of
tidal
flexing
caused
by
the
gravitational
tugofwar
between
io
jupiter
and
the
other
three
galilean
moons
europa
approximately
the
same
size
as
our
moon
is
the
brightest
galilean
satellite
the
moons
surface
displays
a
complex
array
of
streaks
indicating
the
crust
has
been
fractured
caught
in
a
gravitational
tugofwar
like
io
europa
has
been
heated
enough
to
cause
its
interior
ice
to
melt
apparently
producing
a
liquidwater
ocean
this
ocean
is
covered
by
an
ice
crust
that
has
formed
where
water
is
exposed
to
the
cold
of
space
europas
core
is
made
of
rock
that
sank
to
its
center
like
europa
the
other
two
galilean
moons
ganymede
and
callisto
are
worlds
of
ice
and
rock
ganymede
is
the
largest
satellite
in
the
solar
system
larger
than
the
planets
mercury
and
pluto
the
satellite
is
composed
of
about
percent
water
or
ice
and
the
rest
rock
ganymedes
surface
has
areas
of
different
brightness
indicating
that
in
the
past
material
oozed
out
of
the
moons
interior
and
was
deposited
at
various
locations
on
the
surface
callisto
only
slightly
smaller
than
ganymede
has
the
lowest
density
of
any
galilean
satellite
suggesting
that
large
amounts
of
water
are
part
of
its
composition
callisto
is
the
most
heavily
cratered
object
in
the
solar
system
no
activity
during
its
history
has
erased
old
craters
except
more
impacts
detailed
studies
of
all
the
galilean
satellites
will
be
performed
by
the
galileo
orbiter
saturn
no
planet
in
the
solar
system
is
adorned
like
saturn
its
exquisite
ring
system
is
unrivaled
like
jupiter
saturn
is
composed
mostly
of
hydrogen
but
in
contrast
to
the
vivid
colors
and
wild
turbulence
found
in
jovian
clouds
saturns
atmosphere
has
a
more
subtle
butterscotch
hue
and
its
markings
are
muted
by
highaltitude
haze
given
saturns
somewhat
placidlooking
appearance
scientists
were
surprised
at
the
highvelocity
equatorial
jet
stream
that
blows
some
kilometers
miles
per
hour
three
american
spacecraft
have
visited
saturn
pioneer
sped
by
the
planet
and
its
moon
titan
in
september
returning
the
first
closeup
images
voyager
followed
in
november
sending
back
breathtaking
photographs
that
revealed
for
the
first
time
the
complexities
of
saturns
ring
system
and
moons
voyager
flew
by
the
planet
and
its
moons
in
august
the
rings
are
composed
of
countless
lowdensity
particles
orbiting
individually
around
saturns
equator
at
progressive
distances
from
the
cloud
tops
analysis
of
spacecraft
radio
waves
passing
through
the
rings
showed
that
the
particles
vary
widely
in
size
ranging
from
dust
to
housesized
boulders
the
rings
are
bright
because
they
are
mostly
ice
and
frosted
rock
the
rings
might
have
resulted
when
a
moon
or
a
passing
body
ventured
too
close
to
saturn
the
unlucky
object
would
have
been
torn
apart
by
great
tidal
forces
on
its
surface
and
in
its
interior
or
the
object
may
not
have
been
fully
formed
to
begin
with
and
disintegrated
under
the
influence
of
saturns
gravity
a
third
possibility
is
that
the
object
was
shattered
by
collisions
with
larger
objects
orbiting
the
planet
unable
either
to
form
into
a
moon
or
to
drift
away
from
each
other
individual
ring
particles
appear
to
be
held
in
place
by
the
gravitational
pull
of
saturn
and
its
satellites
these
complex
gravitational
interactions
form
the
thousands
of
ringlets
that
make
up
the
major
rings
radio
emissions
quite
similar
to
the
static
heard
on
an
am
car
radio
during
an
electrical
storm
were
detected
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
these
emissions
are
typical
of
lightning
but
are
believed
to
be
coming
from
saturns
ring
system
rather
than
its
atmosphere
where
no
lightning
was
observed
as
they
had
at
jupiter
the
voyagers
saw
a
version
of
earths
auroras
near
saturns
poles
the
voyagers
discovered
new
moons
and
found
several
satellites
that
share
the
same
orbit
we
learned
that
some
moons
shepherd
ring
particles
maintaining
saturns
rings
and
the
gaps
in
the
rings
saturns
moon
was
discovered
in
from
images
taken
by
voyager
in
voyager
determined
that
titan
has
a
nitrogenbased
atmosphere
with
methane
and
argon
one
more
like
earths
in
composition
than
the
carbon
dioxide
atmospheres
of
mars
and
venus
titans
surface
temperature
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
implies
that
there
might
be
waterice
islands
rising
above
oceans
of
ethanemethane
liquid
or
sludge
unfortunately
voyagers
cameras
could
not
penetrate
the
moons
dense
clouds
continuing
photochemistry
from
solar
radiation
may
be
converting
titans
methane
to
ethane
acetylene
and
in
combination
with
nitrogen
hydrogen
cyanide
the
latter
compound
is
a
building
block
of
amino
acids
these
conditions
may
be
similar
to
the
atmospheric
conditions
of
primeval
earth
between
three
and
four
billion
years
ago
however
titans
atmospheric
temperature
is
believed
to
be
too
low
to
permit
progress
beyond
this
stage
of
organic
chemistry
the
exploration
of
saturn
will
continue
with
the
cassini
mission
the
cassini
spacecraft
will
orbit
the
planet
and
will
also
deploy
a
probe
called
huygens
which
will
be
dropped
into
titans
atmosphere
and
fall
to
the
surface
cassini
will
use
the
probe
as
well
as
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
will
spend
years
examining
the
saturnian
system
uranus
in
january
four
and
a
half
years
after
visiting
saturn
voyager
completed
the
first
closeup
survey
of
the
uranian
system
the
brief
flyby
revealed
more
information
about
uranus
and
its
retinue
of
icy
moons
than
had
been
gleaned
from
ground
observations
since
the
planets
discovery
over
two
centuries
ago
by
the
english
astronomer
william
herschel
uranus
third
largest
of
the
planets
is
an
oddball
of
the
solar
system
unlike
the
other
planets
with
the
exception
of
pluto
this
giant
lies
tipped
on
its
side
with
its
north
and
south
poles
alternately
facing
the
sun
during
an
swing
around
the
solar
system
during
voyager
flyby
the
south
pole
faced
the
sun
uranus
might
have
been
knocked
over
when
an
earthsized
object
collided
with
it
early
in
the
life
of
the
solar
system
voyager
found
that
uranus
magnetic
field
does
not
follow
the
usual
northsouth
axis
found
on
the
other
planets
instead
the
field
is
tilted
degrees
and
offset
from
the
planets
center
a
phenomenon
that
on
earth
would
be
like
having
one
magnetic
pole
in
new
york
city
and
the
other
in
the
city
of
djakarta
on
the
island
of
java
in
indonesia
uranus
atmosphere
consists
mainly
of
hydrogen
with
some
percent
helium
and
small
amounts
of
ammonia
methane
and
water
vapor
the

occurs
because
methane
in

to
be
a

thought
to
be
a

voyager
discovered

the

previously
known
miranda
ariel
umbriel
titania
and
oberon
range
in
size
from
to
kilometers
to
miles
across
representing
a
geological
showcase
these

moons
are
halfice
halfrock
spheres
that
are
cold
and
dark
and
show
evidence
of
past
activity
including
faulting
and
ice
flows
the
most
remarkable
of
uranus
moons
is
miranda
its
surface
features
high
cliffs
as
well
as
canyons
craterpocked
plains
and
winding
valleys
the
sharp
variations
in
terrain
suggest
that
after
the
moon
formed
it
was
smashed
apart
by
a
collision
with
another
body
an
event
not
unusual
in
our
solar
system
which
contains
many
objects
that
have
impact
craters
or
are
fragments
from
large
impacts
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
miranda
apparently
reformed
with
some
of
the
material
that
had
been
in
its
interior
exposed
on
its
surface
uranus
was
thought
to
have
nine
dark
rings
voyager
imaged
in
contrast
to
saturns
rings
which
are
composed
of
bright
particles
uranus
rings
are
primarily
made
up
of
dark
bouldersized
chunks
neptune
voyager
completed
its
tour
of
the
solar
system
with
an
investigation
of
neptune
and
the
planets
moons
on
august
the
spacecraft
swept
to
within
kilometers
miles
of
neptune
and
then
flew
on
to
the
moon
triton
during
the
neptune
encounter
it
became
clear
that
the
planets
atmosphere
was
more
active
than
uranus
voyager
observed
the
great
dark
spot
a
circular
storm
the
size
of
earth
in
neptunes
atmosphere
resembling
jupiters
great
red
spot
the
storm
spins
counterclockwise
and
moves
westward
at
almost
kilometers
miles
per
hour
voyager
also
noted
a
smaller
dark
spot
and
a
fastmoving
cloud
dubbed
the

as
well
as
highaltitude

over
the
main
hydrogen

deck
the
highest
wind
speeds
of
any
planet
were
observed
up
to
kilometers

like
the
other
giant

neptune
has
a
gaseous
hydrogen
and
helium
upper
layer
over
a
liquid

the

core
contains
a
higher
percentage
of
rock
and

than
those
of
the
other
gas
giants
neptunes
distinctive
blue
appearance
like
uranus
blue
color
is
due
to
atmospheric
methane
neptunes
magnetic
field
is
tilted
relative
to
the
planets
spin
axis
and
is
not
centered
at
the
core
this
phenomenon
is
similar
to
uranus
magnetic
field
and
suggests
that
the
fields
of
the
two
giants
are
being
generated
in
an
area
above
the
cores
where
the
pressure
is
so
great
that
liquid
hydrogen
assumes
the
electrical
properties
of
a
metal
earths
magnetic
field
on
the
other
hand
is
produced
by
its
spinning
metallic
core
and
is
only
slightly
tilted
and
offset
relative
to
its
center
voyager
also
shed
light
on
the
mystery
of
neptunes
rings
observations
from
earth
indicated
that
there
were
arcs
of
material
in
orbit
around
the
giant
planet
it
was
not
clear
how
neptune
could
have
arcs
and
how
these
could
be
kept
from
spreading
out
into
even
unclumped
rings
voyager
detected
these
arcs
but
they
were
in
fact
part
of
thin
complete
rings
a
number
of
small
moons
could
explain
the
arcs
but
such
bodies
were
not
spotted
astronomers
had
identified
the
neptunian
moons
triton
in
and
nereid
in
voyager
found
six
more
one
of
the
new
moons
proteus
is
actually
larger
than
nereid
but
since
proteus
orbits
close
to
neptune
it
was
lost
in
the
planets
glare
for
observers
on
earth
triton
circles
neptune
in
a
retrograde
orbit
in
under
six
days
tidal
forces
on
triton
are
causing
it
to
spiral
slowly
towards
the
planet
in
to
million
years
a
short
time
in
astronomical
terms
the
moon
will
be
so
close
that
neptunian
gravity
will
tear
it
apart
forming
a
spectacular
ring
to
accompany
the
planets
modest
current
rings
tritons
landscape
is
as
strange
and
unexpected
as
those
of
io
and
miranda
the
moon
has
more
rock
than
its
counterparts
at
saturn
and
uranus
tritons
mantle
is
probably
composed
of
waterice
but
the
moons
crust
is
a
thin
veneer
of
nitrogen
and
methane
the
moon
shows
two
dramatically
different
types
of
terrain
the
socalled
cantaloupe
terrain
and
a
receding
ice
cap
dark
streaks
appear
on
the
ice
cap
these
streaks
are
the
fallout
from
geyserlike
volcanic
vents
that
shoot
nitrogen
gas
and
dark
finegrained
particles
to
heights
of
to
kilometers
to
miles
tritons
thin
atmosphere
only
as
thick
as

has
winds
that
carry
the
dark

and
deposit
them
as

pluto
than
any
other
object
spacecraft
have
so
far
visited
pluto
pluto
is
the
most
distant
of
the
planets
yet
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
periodically
carries
it
inside
neptunes
orbit
where
it
has
been
since
and
where
it
will
remain
until
march
plutos
orbit
is
also
highly
inclined
tilted
degrees
to
the
orbital
plane
of
the
other
planets
discovered
in
pluto
appears
to
be
little
more
than
a
celestial
snowball
the
planets
diameter
is
calculated
to
be
approximately
kilometers
miles
only
twothirds
the
size
of
our
moon
groundbased
observations
indicate
that
plutos
surface
is
covered
with
methane
ice
and
that
there
is
a
thin
atmosphere
that
may
freeze
and
fall
to
the
surface
as
the
planet
moves
away
from
the
sun
observations
also
show
that
plutos
spin
axis
is
tipped
by
degrees
the
planet
has
one
known
satellite
charon
discovered
in
charons
surface
composition
is
different
from
plutos
the
moon
appears
to
be
covered
with
waterice
rather
than
methane
ice
its
orbit
is
gravitationally
locked
with
pluto
so
both
bodies
always
keep
the
same
hemisphere
facing
each
other
plutos
and
charons
rotational

currently
exploring
the
possibility
of
such
a
mission
comets
the
outermost
members
of
the
solar
system
occasionally
pay
a
visit
to
the
inner
planets
as
asteroids
are
the
rocky
and
metallic
remnants
of
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
comets
are
the
icy
debris
from
that
dim
beginning
and
can
survive
only
far
from
the
sun
most
comet
nuclei
reside
in
the
oort
cloud
a
loose
swarm
of
objects
in
a
halo
beyond
the
planets
and
reaching
perhaps
halfway
to
the
nearest
star
comet
nuclei
orbit
in
this
frozen
abyss
until
they
are
gravitationally
perturbed
into
new
orbits
that
carry
them
close
to
the
sun
as
a
nucleus
falls
inside
the
orbits
of
the
outer
planets
the
volatile
elements
of
which
it
is
made
gradually
warm
by
the
time
the
nucleus
enters
the
region
of
the
inner
planets
these
volatile
elements
are
boiling
the
nucleus
itself
is
irregular
and
only
a
few
miles
across
and
is
made
principally
of
waterice
with
methane
and
ammonia
materials
very
similar
to
those
composing
the
moons
of
the
giant
planets
as
these
materials
boil
off
of
the
nucleus
they
form
a
coma
or
cloudlike
head
that
can
measure
tens
of
thousands
of
kilometers
across
the
coma
grows
as
the
comet
gets
closer
to
the
sun
the
stream
of
charged
particles
coming
from
the
sun
pushes
on
this
cloud
blowing
it
back
like
a
flag
in
the
wind
and
giving
rise
to
the
comets
tails
gases
and
ions
are
blown
directly
back
from
the
nucleus
but
dust
particles
are
pushed
more
slowly
as
the
nucleus
continues
in
its
orbit
the
dust
particles
are
left
behind
in
a
curved
arc
both
the
gas
and
dust
tails
point
away
from
the
sun
in
effect
the
comet
chases
its
tails
as
it
recedes
from
the
sun
the
tails
can
reach
million
kilometers
million
miles
in
length
but
the
total
amount
of
material
contained
in
this
dramatic
display
would
fit
in
an
ordinary
suitcase
comets
from
the
latin
cometa
meaning
longhaired
are
essentially
dramatic
light
shows
some
comets
pass
through
the
solar
system
only
once
but
others
have
their
orbits
gravitationally
modified
by
a
close
encounter
with
one
of
the
giant
outer

this

is
named
for
sir

halley
because
he
plotted
the
comets
orbit
and
predicted
its

based
on
earlier

and
newtonian

his
name
became

a

can
be
very
prominent
in

if

unfortunately
on
its

halleys
comet
passed
no
closer
than

million
miles
from

the
comet
was
visible
to
the

eye
especially
for

in
the
southern

it
was
not

we

has
redefined
traditional
earth
sciences
like

spawned
an

called
comparative
planetology
by
studying
the

of
planets
moons
asteroids

and
comparing

we

learning
more
about
the

of
these

the

re
gamma
ray
bursters
where
are
they
i
feel
compelled
to
complain
the
statement
that
recent
observations
rule
out
merging
neutron
stars
as
sources
of
gammaray
bursts
is
utterly
false
even
though
it
is
popular
enough
to
make
it
to
batse
press
releases
the
idea
behind
the
statement
is
as
follows
if
you
smack
two
neutron
stars
together
or
have
a
neutron
star
be
gobbled
up
by
a
black
hole
a
lot
of
energy
is
released
enough
for
a
gammaray
burst
at
a
cosmological
distance
but
so
the
reasoning
continues
this
energy
is
released
below
a
lot
of
matter
so
the
radiation
becomes
thermalized
and
you
expect
to
see
roughly
a
blackbody
spectrum
the
observed
spectra
are
strongly
nonthermal
so
this
model
must
be
wrong
as
so
often
the
fault
lies
with
the
imagination
of
the
person
who
was
trying
to
prove
the
model
wrong
rather
than
with
the
model
it
may
be
that
the
initial
energy
release
is
not
seen
as
a
gammaray
burst
but
the
fireball
of
energy
and
matter
that
is
created
may
spew
out
a
relativistic
flow
when
this
slams
into
the
surrounding
medium
a
strong
flux
of
nonthermal
gamma
rays
results
which
may
carry
off
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
initial
total
energy
all
this
is
not
my
idea
it
is
in
a
series
of
papers
by
martin
rees
peter
meszaros
sorry
for
the
missing
accents
and
coworkers
it
is
certainly
not
a
complete
model
but
it
may
well
be
the
best
one
around
summing
over
all
proposed
distance
scales
an
alternative
proposal
for
what
creates
the
initial
fireball
by
the
way
is
the
socalled
failed
supernovae
scenario
by
stan
woosley
in
which
a
very
massive
star
at
the
end
of
its
life
collapses
to
a
black
hole
if
the
stellar
core
was
rotating
part
of
the
infalling
matter
will
be
temporarily
halted
because
it
is
supported
by
centrifugal
force
and
form
a
very
dense
neutron
torus
that
accretes
onto
the
black
hole
this
beast
may
spew
out
a
jet
along
the
rotation
axis
which
again
constitutes
relativistic
flow
the
rate
of
such
events
may
be
much
higher
than
that
of
neutron
star
mergers
but
the
flux
may
be
more
strongly
beamed
so
that
the
net
rate
of
bursts
observed
on
earth
stays
the
same
between
the
two
scenarios
but
the
energy
released
per
event
can
be
a
lot
less
in
the
failed
supernova
scenario
on
another
note
i
do
believe
that
the
distance
scale
must
ultimately
be
resolved
via
some
classical
astronomical
method
such
as
finding
counterparts
to
the
bursts
at
other
wavelengths
or
finding
a
definitive
signature
of
some
known
class
of
objects
in
the
distribution
of
positions
and
fluxes
theorists
have
historically
not
been
too
successfull
in
finding
the
distance
of
any
object
by
proving
that
there
is
only
one
possible
way
in
which
the
object
can
work
and
therefore
it
must
be

sf

did
an

on
a
similar
subject
quite
a
few
years
ago
the
question
was
if
an
alien
spacecraft
landed
in
washington
dc
what
was
the
proper
organization
to
deal
with
it
the
state

alien

the

alien

the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
illegal
aliens
the
department
of
the

new

etc
it
was
very
much
a
question
of
our
perception
of
the
aliens
not
of
anything
intrinsic
in
their
nature
the
bibliography
for
the
article
cited
a
philosophical
paper
the
name
and
author
of
which
i
sadly
forget
i
believe
the
author
was
italian
on
what
constitutes
a
legal
andor
moral
person
ie
a
being
entitled
to
the
rights
normally
accorded
to
a
person
the
paper
was
quite
interesting
as
i
recall
if
we
encounter
a
civilization
that
is
suffering
economicly
will
we
expend
resources
from
earth
to
help
them
i
think
youd
have
to
be
very
careful
here
if
the
answer
is
yes
the
human
track
record
on
helping
those
poor
underpriveleged
cultures
does
underpriveleged
mean
not
having
enough
priveleges
is
terrible
the
usual
result
is
the
destruction
or
radical
reorganization
of
the
culture
this
may
not
always
be
wrong
but
thats
the
way
to
bet
with
all
of
the
deseases
we
currently
have
that
are
deadly
and
undetectable
what
will
be
done
to
ensure
that
more

rarely
seem
to
have
a
consistent
view
of
the
role
of
government
in
science

technology
basically
the
us
government
has
gotten
into
the
role
of
supporting
research
which
private
industry
finds
too
expensive
or
too
longterm
historically
this
role
for
the
us
govt
was
forced
upon
it
because
of
socialism
in
other
countries
in
order
for
us
industries
to
compete

foreign
competitors
the
us
govt
has
taken
on
the
role
of
subisizing
bigticket
or
longlead
rd
as
a
republican
i
abhor
the
necessity
for
our
government
to
involve
itself
in
technology
this
way
i
believe
that
market
forces
should
drive
technology
and
the
world
would
be
a
better
place
for
it
but
the
whole
world
would
have
to
implement
this
concept
simultaneously
or
some
countries
would
have
subsidized
rd
while
others
would
not
so
the
us
must
subsidize
because
everybody
else
does
this
sounds
a
lot
like
the
farm
subsidies
arguments
behind
our
gatt
negotiations
doesnt
it
but
this
role
of
government
subsidies
is
antithetical
to
costeffectiveness
the
general
idea
is
to
spend
money
on
new
technology
and
thereby
maintain
and
promote
our
technological
culture
despite
the
forces
in
the
business
world
like
the
dreaded
quarterly
earnings
report
which
erode
the
ability
of
us
industry
to
invest
in
new
technology
and
since
our
goal
is
to
spend
money
it
makes
little
sense
to
try
to
save
money
of
course
we
could
always
spend
our
money
more
wisely

everybody
disagrees
about
that
the

it

there
is

the

the

isnt

the

both

is

a

carried

the

from
what
i
understand
the

on

are
tight
enough
they
cant
even
carry

or
mmus
now
if
they
used

i
would
bet
just
a
wild
guess
that
the

on

would
allow
carrying
the

extra

more

parts
for

parts
for

and
still
enough
for
a

or
the
hst
could
even
get
placed
into
some
sort
of
medium

the
reason
they
want
a
high

is
less
antenna
pointing
and
longer

life
and
that
means
you
can
then
carry

so
the

can
go

at

thus
the

must
heat
up

moreover
the

i
have

living

has

the

that
scares
me
is
the

about
simply
strapping

a
nosecone
on

just
launching

i
have
this
vision
of
something
going
terribly
wrong
with
the

resulting
in
the

from

let
me
give
you
an
example
when
you
watch

they
have

for

you
accept
that
as

of
watching
if
you

there
is
a

out
there
you
cant

the

reasoning
that
limits

if

you
have

you

any

if

get
some

theoretically
they
can

in
practice
they
use
it
mostly
to
control
large

i
say
what
im
objecting
to
here
is
a
floating

that
presumably
would
move
around

i
for
one
am
against
legislating

i
just
wish
that

one
thing
to
recall
putting
a
satellite
as
high
as
possible
is
one
thing
coming
back
to
not
only
that
altitude
but
matching
the
position
of
it
in
its
orbit
on
a
subsequent
mission
is
another
thing
any
misalignment
of
the
plane
of
the
orbit
during
launch
or
being
ahead
or
behind
the
target
will
require
more
fuel
to
adjust
this
was
considered
in

agree

that
the

boldly
in

doug
loss
writes
analog
sf
magazine
did
an
article
on
a
similar
subject
quite
a
few
years
ago
the
question
was
if
an
alien
spacecraft
landed
in
washington
dc
what
was
the
proper
organization
to
deal
with
it
the
state
department
alien
ambassadors
the
defense
department
alien
invaders
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
illegal
aliens
the
department
of
the
interior
new
nonhuman
species
etc
it
was
very
much
a
question
of
our
perception
of
the
aliens
not
of
anything
intrinsic
in
their
nature
the
bibliography
for
the
article
cited
a
philosophical
paper
the
name
and
author
of
which
i
sadly
forget
i
believe
the
author
was
italian
on
what
constitutes
a
legal
andor
moral
person
ie
a
being
entitled
to
the
rights
normally
accorded
to
a
person
the
paper
was
quite
interesting
as
i
recall
this
is
a
whole
different
situation
if
aliens
were
able
to
get
here
prior
to
us
being
able
to
get
there
one
might
conclude
that
they
would
be
more
advanced
and
therefore
more
intelegent
that
we
are
however
if
we
get
somewhere
where
there
is
life
chances
are
we
wont
be
able
to
communicate
with
them
so
we
will
have
no
clue
as
to
weather
they
are
intelegent
or
not
i
think
youd
have
to
be
very
careful
here
if
the
answer
is
yes
the
human
track
record
on
helping
those
poor
underpriveleged
cultures
does
underpriveleged
mean
not
having
enough
priveleges
is
terrible
the
usual
result
is
the
destruction
or
radical
reorganization
of
the
culture
this
may
not
always
be
wrong
but
thats
the
way
to
bet
thats
a
good
point
i
hadnt
thought
of
it
that
way
my
question
however
was
more
along
the
lines
of
every
year
the
us
spends
millions
of
tax
dollars
and
giving
tax
breaks
to
individuals
and
companies
who
feed
the
poor
of
foreign
countries
while
thousands
of
our
own
people
sleep
on
the
streets
at
night
would
we
give
to
the
economicly
dissadvantaged
on
another
planet
if
we
hadnt
resolved
these
issues
on
our
own
but
your
comment
brings
up
another
good
question
over
the
years
we
have
decided
that
certain
cultures
need
improvements
the
native
americans
is
a
good
example
prior
to
our
attempt
to
civilize
them
the
native
american
culture
had
very
little
crime
no
homelessnes
no
poverty
then
the
europeans
came
along
and
now
they
have
those
and
more
if
we
encounter
life
elsewhere
do
we
tell
them
they
have
to
live
in
houses
farm

will
be
fired

the

is
a
heavy
thing
the
hst
isnt
light
either
the
amount
of
oms
fuel
needed
to
fly
both
up
is
substantial
a
small
booster
carried
up
and
used
to
boost
hst
on
its
own
will
weigh
significantly
less
then
the
oms
fuel
required
to
boost
both
hst
and
shuttle
for
a
given
orbital
change
could
you
supply
some
calculations
you
might
check
some
recent
postings
that
explained
that
a
small
booster
as
suggested
does
not
now
exist
so
comparing
the
mass
of
something
that
doesnt
exist
to
the
mass
of
the
oms
fuel
seems
impossible
the
contamination
threat
also
remains
how
different
would
the
contamination
threat
of
a
small
manuevering
tug
be
from
that
of
the

and
its

engines
i
know
that
no

manuevering
tug
exists
but
maybe
one
could
soup
up

does
anyone

have
the
declasified

on
hte
bus
would
it
be
able

provide
enough
control
force
to
balance
the
hst
and
still
have
the
rocket
thrust
to
hurl
her
into
a
decent
high
orbit
or
the
hst
could
even
get
placed
into
some
sort
of
medium
orbit
the
reason
they
want
a
high
orbit
is
less
antenna
pointing
and
longer

longer

the

design

each

would
be
tied

as
the
case
may
be
this
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for

the

mission
can
act
as
either
mother

for

also
the

would

im
no
astronaut
but
ive
flown
in
the
several
times
ill
tell
you
about
my
first
flight
at
the
onset
of
weightlessness
my
shoulders
lifted
and
my
spine
straightened
i
felt
a
momentary
panic
and
my
hands
tried
to
grab
onto
something
like
the
strap
keeping
me
firmly
against
the
floor
to
prevent
me
from
falling
i
remember
conciously
overruling
my
involuntary
motions
my
ears
felt
not
heard
a
rush
and
i
could
feel
fluid
moving
in
my
head
like
when
you
get
up
from
bed
while
you
have
a
cold
at
that
point
i
ceased
to
concentrate
on
my
physiological
response
since
i
had
some
science
to
do
i
was
busy
keeping
my
experiment
going
and
keeping
track
of
all
the
parts
during
the
return
of
gravity
and
subsequent
pullout
so
i
didnt
really
pay
attention
to
physiology
at
that
time
after
about
parabolas
i
discovered
that
i
was
performing
one
of
the
tricks
ive
discovered
to
keep
myself
from
getting
motion
sickness
i
was
keeping
my
head
very
still
and
moving
very
slowly
all
except
my
hands
and
arms
which
needed
to
be
in
rapid
concious
motion
for
my
experiment
during
the
pullout
to
parabola
my
queasiness
finally
started
to
get
to
me
and
i
had
to
use
one
of
those
airsickness
bags
i
was
basically
useless
for
the
rest
of
that
flight
so
i
went
to
the
seats
in
the
back
of
the
plane
while
my
partner
whom
i
drafted
for
just
this
purpose
kept
working
on

while
i
was
ill
he
was
a
vetran
vomit
comet
rider
one
of
those
anomalous
people
who
dont
get
sick
on
the
thing
i
didnt
think
of
it
as
a
constant
sensation
of
falling
so
much
as
like
swimming
in
air
its
very
close
to
the
sensations
i
feel
when
im

i
turn
my
head
down

up
jerry
and
what
is
the
motion
sickness
that
some
astronauts
occasionally
experience
ron
it
is
the
bodys
reaction
to
a
strange
environment
it
appears
to
be
induced
partly
to
physical
discomfort
and
part
to
mental
distress
some
people
are
more
prone
to
it
than
others
like
some
people
are
more
prone
to
get
sick
on

roller
coaster

than

the
mental
part
is
usually
induced
by
a
lack
of
clear
indication
of
which
way
is
up
or
down
ie
the
shuttle
is
normally
oriented
with
its
cargo
bay
pointed
towards
earth
so
the
earth
or
ground
is
above
the
head
of
the
astronauts
about
of
the
astronauts
experience
some
form
of
motion
sickness
and

has
done
numerous
tests
in

try
to
see
how
to
keep
the
number
of
occurances
down

there

your

will

to

maybe
a

the

the

environment
reduces
ductility
in

due

temperature
extremes
monotomic
oxygen

so
your

for

okay
the
earth
has
a
magnetic
field
if
you
put
a
object
in
the
earth
magnetic
field
it
produces
electricty
well
its
not
that
simple
youre
in
earths
magnetic
field
and
you
dont
generate
electricity
but
it
can
be
done
now
the
question
can
you
use
electricity
to
power
a
spacelow
earth
orbit
vehicle
and
i
fyou
can
can
you
use
the
magnetic
field
of
the
earth
to
power
it
the
way
you
power
things
is
with
electricity
so
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
definitely
yes
if
you
meant
to
say
propel
rather
than
power
the
answer
is
sort
of
yes
you
can
use
interaction
with
the
earths
magnetic
field
to
get
electrical
power
and
there
are
potential
applications
for
this
however
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
no
free
lunch
the
energy
isnt
coming
from
nowhere
what
such
systems
do
is
convert
some
of
the
energy
of
your
orbital
velocity
into
electrical
energy
there
are
cases
where
this
is
a
useful
tradeoff
using
power
obtained
in
this
way
for
propulsion
is
useful
only
in
special
situations
however
what
you
can
do
is
get
your
power
by
some
other
means
eg
solar
arrays
and
run
the
interaction
with
the
magnetic
field
in
reverse
pumping
energy
into
the
orbit
rather
than
taking
energy
out
of
it
if
you
want
more
information
trying
looking
up
electrodynamic
propulsion
tether
applications
and
magsails
can
the
idea
of
a
dragless
satellite
be
used
in
part
to
create
the
electrical
field
no
a
dragless
satellite
does
not
magically
have
no
drag
it
burns
fuel
constantly
to
fight
drag
maintaining
the
exact
orbit
it
would
have
if
there
was
no
drag
this
is
why
there
are
quotes
around
dragless

this
is

if

the

can
act

i
cant
see
the
need
for
a
single
big
expensive
heavy
mothership
except
for
voyager
style
flyby
missions
a
few
years
ago
i
did
some
calculations
on
a
grand
tour
space
probe
launched
by
a
saturn
v
in
at
the
timei
felt
that
the
idea
of
a
big
mother
ship
had
some
merit
the
voyagers
had
to
be
rather
small
lightweight
craft
due
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
using
weak
titan
iiicentaur
launchers
the
concept
i
examined
and
michaels
had
a
lot
in
common
with
the
british
interplanetary
societys
daedalus
project
for
sending
a
probe
to
barnards
star
ie
a
large
bus
spacecraft
carrying
several
smaller
probes
to
be
dispatched
when
the
ship
arrives
at
its
destination
the
saturn
v
supposedly
would
have
been
able
to
launch
a
payload
towards
jupiter
and
beyond
the
bus
could
have
included
far
more
powerful
camerastelescopesscientific
equipment
and
a
heaviermore
powerful
power
source
than
the
voyagers
as
there
would
be
no
limitations
on
weight
anymore
extremely
important
as
the
voyagers
had
to
perform
most
of
their
measurements
within
a
couple
of
weeks
before
and
after
planetary
encounter
and
usually
at
a
relatively
great
distance
the
smaller
probes
carried
aboard
might
have
been
based
on
the
real
voyagers
and
an
even
smaller
version
like
the
one
scheduled
for
launch
towards
pluto
in
the
early
century
and
would
have
been
released
at
various
points
during
the
mission
the
advantages
are
obvious
the
bus
would
have
carried
out
the
same
basic
jupitersaturnuranusneptune
mission
than
voyager
did
but
in
addition
two
subprobes
could
have
been
relased
at
saturn
examining
that
planets
south
polar
regions
before
moving
on
to
pluto
this
would
have
enabled
nasa
to
map
both
hemispheres
of
plutocharon
by
several
other
probes
could
have
examined
parts
of
the
jupitersaturnuranusneptune
systems
that
werent
examined
in
great
detail
by
the
voyagers
due
to
trajectoryrelated
factors
a
small
swarm
of
cameraequipped
miniature
space
probes
released
a
month
before
encounter
would
have
been
too
costly
for
a
small
voyagertype
mission
but
entirely
feasible
if
launched
from
a
heavy
wellequipped
spacecraft
and
would
we
have
learned
a
lot
more
about
the
outer

the
reason
why

people
who
criticize
big
government
and
its
projects
rarely
seem
to
have
a
consistent
view
of
the
role
of
government
in
science
and
technology
basically
the
us
government
has
gotten
into
the
role
of
supporting
research
which
private
industry
finds
too
expensive
or
too
longterm
historically
this
role
for
the
us
govt
was
forced
upon
it
because
of
socialism
in
other
countries
in
order
for
us
industries
to
compete
with
governmentsubsidized
foreign
competitors
the
us
govt
has
taken
on
the
role
of
subisizing
bigticket
or
longlead
rd
this
definitely
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
entry
of
the
government
into
the
support
of
science
some
of
it
is
relevant
in
technology
there
was
little
involvement
of
federal
funds
or
except
through
support
of
state
universities
of
state
funds
for
scientific
research
before
wwii
the
us
research
position
had
been
growing
steadily
and
the
funding
was
mainly
from
university
and
private
foundation
funds
there
were
not
that
many
research
universities
but
they
all
provided
their
researchers
with
low
teaching
loads
laboratories
assistants
and
equipment
and
funds
for
travel
to
scientific
meetings
not
that
much
but
it
was
provided
and
a
university
wishing
to
get
a
scholar
had
to
consider
research
funding
as
well
as
salary
during
wwii
the
military
and
the
defense
departments
found
that
pure
scientists
could
do
quite
well
with
their
problems
even
though
they
were
not
exactly
in
the
areas
of
the
scientists
expertise
this
is
probably
because
of
the
research
mind
approach
which
is
not
to
try
to
find
a
solution
but
to
understand
the
problem
and
see
if
a
solution
emerges
this
works
in
stages
and
as
research
scientists
were
used
to
discussion
about
their
problems
the
job
got
done
the
military
realized
the
importance
of
maintaining
scientists
for
the
future
and
started
funding
pure
research
after
wwii
but
congress
was
unwilling
to
have
military
funds
diverted
into
this
investment
into
the
future
supply
of
scientists
and
set
up
other
organizations
such
as
nsf
to
do
the
job
it
also
set
up
an
elaborate
procedure
to
supposedly
keep
politics
out
also
the
government
did
a
job
on
private
foundations
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
act
to
support
research
the
worst
part
of
the
federal
involvement
is
that
in
those
areas
in
which
the
government
supports
research
the
university
will
not
provide
funding
and
in
fact
expects
its
scholars
to
bring
in
net
government
money
suppose
as
has
been
the
case
i
have
a
project
which
could
use
the
assistance
of
a
graduate
student
for
a
few
months
what
do
you
think
happens
if
i
ask
for
one
the
answer
i
will
get
is
get
the
money
from
nsf
now
the
money
at
the
university
level
is
a
few
thousand
but
at
the
nsf
level
it
comes
to
about
thousand
and
is
likely
to
keep
a
faculty
member
from
getting
supported
so
the
government
is
in
effect
deciding
which
projects
get
supported
and
how
much
also
the
government
decided
that
the
wealth
should
be
spread
so
instead
of
having
a
moderate
number
of
universities
which
were
primarily
research
institutions
the
idea
that
more
schools
should
get
into
the
act
came
into
being
and
instead
of
evaluating
scholars
they
had
to
go
to
evaluating
reseach
proposals
as
a
researcher
i
can
tell
you
that
any
research
proposal
has
to
be
mainly
wishful
thinking
or
as
now
happens
the
investigator
conceals
already
done
work
to
release
it
as
the
results
of
the
research
what
i
am
proposing
today
i
may
solve
before
the
funding
is
granted
i
may
find
impossible
or
i
may
find
that
it
is
too
difficult
in
addition
tomorrow
i
may
get
unexpected
research
results
possibly
i
may
bet
a
bright
idea
which
solves
yesterdays
too
difficult
problem
or
a
whole
new
approach
to
something
i
had
not
considered
can
develop
this
is
the
nature
of
the
beast
and
except
for
really
vague
statements
if
something
can
be
predicted
it
is
not
major
research
but
development
or
routine
activity
not
requiring
more
than
minimal
attention
of
a
good
researcher
i
believe
that
at
this
time
less
quality
research
is
being
done
than
would
have
happened
if
the
government
had
never
gotten
into
it
and
the
government
is
trying
to
divert
researchers
from
thinkers
to
plodders

the

go

thus
you

from

in
most
places
to
get
a

you
have
to
either
order

at
high
cost
or
call
a
store
in
arizona
you
could
order
it
special
if
enough
people
did
so
it
would
be
low
cost
last
i
checked
you
could
use

to
buy
stuff
in
arizona
before

finally
im
sure
your
state
has
things
like
small
factories
and
machine
shops
you
could
go
into
business
making
lights
that
are
cheaper
to
use
thanks
to
their
higher
efficiency
and
the
fact
that
they
arent
wasting

on
broadcasting
to

therefore
better

five

were

a

would
have
been
either
a

something
like
mmis

or
the

the
military
is
allegedly
using
now
that
probably
cost
less
to
develop
than
the
shuttle
does
to
fly
for
a
year
the
engineering
specs
that
the
guys
in
the
trenches
had
were
to
develop
a
system
which
was
manratable
could
land
reliably
and
could
be
reflown
these
goals
were
quite
visionary
for
the
and
i
would
argue
that
they
are
challenging
even
today
including
for
the
dcx
program
keep
that
attitude
and
itll
be
a
couple
centuries
before
we
get
real
access
to
space
unless
another
country
without
all
that
baggage
comes
along
and
kicks
our
ass
in
the
space
race
i
do
not
recall
a
flightweek
specification
in
the
final
nasa
specs
for
the
space
shuttle
program
if
you
have
such
documents
i
would
find
them
most
revealing
and
interesting
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
only
people
touting
a
flight
per
week
flight
rate
were
people
on
capitol
hill
or
selling
books
to
the
general
public
or
nasa
hq
that
doesnt
give
the
rest
of
the
program
plausible
deniability
if
we
deceide
that
it
wasnt
worth
the
money
weve
spent
which
is
by
now
probably
a
lot
more
than
apollo
imho
political
statements
in
the
halls
of
the
us
congress
are
not
admissable
as
engineering
specs
because
specs
should
be
determined
by
nasadod
and
contractors
not
by
congressmen
senators
or
presidents
missions
are
defined
by
political
leaders
but
not
the
engineering
specs
yes
but
it
gets
sold
on
the
basis
of
the
political
statements
youre
saying
basically
that
it
met
the
engineering
specs
which
is
questionable
imho
so
its
a
success
never
mind
that
you
couldnt
get
the
funding
the
shuttle
eats
with
those
engineering
specs
in
a
thousand
years
the
shuttle
is
the
only
reusable
space
vehicle
this
automatically
qualifies
it
as
an
unparalleled
engineering
success
you
could
argue
about
its
political
success
but
engineering
wise
it
is
clearly
the
most
advanced
machine
ever
flown
i
argue
that
engineering
and
technical
data
for
hypersonic
flight
is
valuable
in
and
of
itself
shuttle
should
be
justified
or
criticized
on
the
basis
of
economics
you
can
get
hypersonic
flight
data
with
an
or
a
followon
type
vehicle
for
much
less
and
economics
and
engineering
are
interchangable
engineering
in
the
absense
of
economics
is
basically
just
physics
and
in
terms
of
physics
the
shuttle
looks
like
a
failure

to
the
then

i
was

by
this

other
similar

from
those

of
the
dcx

your
support
of
dcx
is
based
on
hopes
my
support
for
the
shuttle
program
is
based
on
record
the
shuttle
program
has
a
bad
record
i
once
had
hopes
for
the
shuttle
program
by
now
i
know
those
hopes
were
false
all
i
have
for
dcx
and
similar
and
dissimilar
experimental
vehicles
are
hopes
but
at
least
i
know
they
arent
false
hopes
yet
i
did
support
the
shuttle
way
back
when
it
didnt
do
nearly
what
it
was
supposed
to
its
time
to
move
on
to
something
that
might
do
the
job
of
orbital
delivery
better
or
at
all
i
think
that
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
i
do
not
object
to
dcx
it
is
visionary
i
originally
posted
i
like
the
dcx
idea
and
i
am
really
hopeful
that
itll
be
a
stunning
success
unfortunately
dcxers
are
not
willing
to
return
that
support
the
proven
shuttle
program
explain
why
you
folks
criticize
shuttle
when
shuttle
is
exactly
what
you
guys
need
in
order
to
learn
how
to
operate
dcx
onorbit
we
dont
want
to
learn
how
to
operate
on
orbit
it
launches
it
shoves
out
the
payload
it
lands
it
doesnt
waste
payload
hauling
up

down
edo
pallets
and
the
like
the
only
thing
to
be
learned
from
shuttle
is
how
not
to
build
a

finally
that
bit
about
the
proven

are
you
hoping
you
can
tell
a
lie
enough

get
someone
to
believe

i
enjoyed
your

postings
regarding
the
comparisons
between
the
shuttle
and
the
soyuz
project
although
i
may
disagree
with
your
method
of
analysis
you
probably
will
disagree
with
mine
i
think
that
the
total
impact
of
the
shuttle
program
must
be
judged
on
the
scientific
and
technical
merit
not
on
timelines
and
schedules
do
you
agree
how
much
science
and
technology
could
have
been
done
is
the
money
spent
on
shuttle
had
been
spent
differently
as
for
now
we
need
to
stop
thinking
of
dcx

you

no

hear

break
out

cycle
by
keeping

and

hardware
its
been
to
my
mind
incredibly
successful
already
theyve
built
a
complex
prototype
in
under
days
for
under
megabucks
i
would
have
been
extremely
skeptical

accomplished
in

never
mind
flying
the
thing
getting

launch

are

down
those
costs

represents
another
assault
on
the
problem
from
a
different
direction
it
doesnt
lower
costperpound
but
it
offers
an
orbital
launch
for
under
ten
megabucks
its
creating
its
own
market
for
small

i
read
the
magazines
and
ive
attended
the

are
plenty

some

well
spenzwhat
can
i
say
youve
attacked
my
beloved
vehicle
if
i
may
offer
a
constructive
criticism
perhaps
you
should
decide
if
you
love
vehicles
or
the
use
they
are
put
to
i
myself
think
the
is
a
beautiful
aircraft
but
rest
assured
i
wouldnt
even
think
of
flying
it
in
combat
today
most
of
us
want
access
to
space
and
judge
vehicles
on
how
they
perform
we
see
zerodefects
operation
in
many
areas
of
life
not
to
this
degree
calling
shuttle
flight
characteristics
bizarre
in
the
same
post
as
touting
dcx
is
interesting
why
dcx
will
also
have
similar
zerodefects
issues
am
i
wrong
your
wrong
the
dc
approach
is
very
tollerent
of
failure
it
also
has
the
advantage
of
far
greater
reliability
do
to
its
reusable
nature
shuttle
isnt
reusable
its
salvagable
i
am
thinking
of
how
dcx
will
deploy
a
chute
or
reverse
orientation
at
supersonic
speeds
the
flip
over
happens
at
a
very
low
speed
not
supersonic
if
the
dcx
shows
the
flip
over
works
it
will
work
unless
the
laws
of
physics
change
how
much
in
dcx
is
redundant
thats
the
real
question
the
final
will
have
fully
intact
abort
throughout
the
entire
flight
envelop
upon
reentry
for
example
it
can
loose
about
of
available
thrust
and
still
land
safely
everything
we
do
in
life
has
zerodefects
issues
at
times
agree
everything
can
suffer
from
catastrophic
failure
but
thats
not
the
same
thing
shuttle
simply
isnt
a
fault
tolerent
design
ssto
is
as
a
doctor
i
can
not
error
in
my
diagnosis
and
treatment
recommendations
you
dont
put
your
patients
in
conditions
where
there
is
no
way
out
you
wouldnt
for
example
give
a
patient
a
drug
and
not
monitor
them
for
harmful
side
effects
would
you
while
dcxs
rd
program
makes
good
sense
i
am
less
optimistic
about
dcx
as
you
and
apparently
others
are
you
are
very
much
in
the
minority
if
the
dc
series
fails
to
make
orbit
it
will
still
be
a
very
worthwhile
effort
it
will
show
us
exactly
what
we
do
need
to
do
to
build
ssto
but
dcx
will
still
have
failures
it
is
the
nature
of
aerospace
rd
again
refering

the
it
will

shuttle
doesnt

to
be

not
true
build
a

a
fairly
easy
thing
to
do
and
it
will
carry

the
impression
i
had
when
i
visited
macdac
huntington
beachs
open
house
was
that
the
payload
space
was
limited
and
the
manratable
version
was
decades
away
i
would
suggest
you
talk
to
the
dcx
crew
themselves
their
original
schedule
had
an
operational
flying
in
shuttle
is
the
only
method
in
the

of
orbiting
large
life
sciences
and
medical
related
packages
as
for
now
it
is
our
only
ticket
into

and
has
my
support
your
ignoring
the
dammage
it
does
mannes
space
has
a
reputation
for
being
unreliable
and
hugely
expensive
shuttle
supporters
only
make
it
easy
for

you
could
change

view

you
could

to

as
a
rough
guess
i
would
say
that
in
years
shuttle
has
delivered
to
leo
about
as
much
as
saturn
v
did
in
years
we
have
to
be
careful
to
define
what
is
payload
and
what
is
propulsion
and
spacecraft
structure
often
shuttle
lifts
satellites
with
upper
stages
yet
we
still
consider
it
payload
ten
saturn
flights
over
about
years
delivered
to
leo
roughly
the
same
as
shuttle
flights
over
years
of
course
saturn
lifted
more
than
shuttle
but
its
cost
to
orbit
in
same
year
dollars
was
higher
they
where
pretty
much
the
same
in
terms
of
costpound
a
resurected
saturn
would
cost
only
per
pound
if
development
costs
are
ignored
which
is
five
times
cheaper
than

john
mckernan
writes
some
new
information
has
been
discovered
recently
microscopic
fossils
have
been
found
in
very
old
rocks
the
theory
is
that
this
life
is
so
old
that
it
must
have
been
destroyed
during
the
periodic
intense
meteorite
bombardments
that
were
a
feature
of
the
early
solar
system
under
this
theory
life
originated
on
earth
multiple
times
between
multiple
meteorite
bombardments
and
therefore
the
conditions
for
the
creation
of
life
cannot
be
that
unlikely
this
was
all
badly
reported
in
the
news
there
is
no
evidence
that
signs
of
life
found
in
old
rock
predate
putative
planetsterilizing
events
rather
the
argument
was
that
if
life
arose
shortly
the
last
sterilizing
event
then
it
must
be
easily
formed
the
inference
was
that
life
originated
before
and
was
destroyed
but
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
however
even
this
argument
is
flawed
it
could
well
be
that
origin
of
life
requires
specific
conditions
say
a
certain
composition
of
the
atmosphere
that
do
not
last
for
long
so
perhaps
life
formed
early
only
because
it
would
have
had
no
other
chance
to
do
so
not
because
it
was
likely
that
life
would
originate
under
those
conditions

without

its

showed
immediate
dramatic
results
solving
problems
that
previously
were
fatal
although
initially
enormously
expensive
to
culture
within
years
the
price
had
fallen
at

two

within

was

more
expensive

is
not

for

reasons
it
can

see
no

it

referred

is
in

the

location
also
has
some
strategic
advantages
in
the
form
of
necessary
infrastructure
and
controlled
air
space
to
support
the
project
just
because
the
folks
involved
have
not
done
the
traditional
aerospaceequivalent
of
vaporware
by
inviting
folks
out
to
kick
nonexistent
tires
but
have
been
merely
doing
their
job
to
prepare
for
launch
dont
think
that
nothing
has
happened
from
my
interactions
with
the
macdac
folks
i
get
the
impression
that
they
want
to
set
a
firm
believable
launch
date
based
on
vehicle
readiness
and
not
just
some
fiction
to
plug
a
space
on

i
believe
that
all
will
happen
this

dont

hundred

hence
i
must
admit
that
that
makes

favorites
not

great
i
make
no
comment

you

remark

no
kant
with
thankfully
i
havent
read
enough
of
either
to
comment
although
everyone
tells
me
i
should
read
nietzche
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
greatest
philosopher
title
would
have
to
go
to
plato
since
the
whole
enterprise
of
philosophy
was
essentially
defined
by
him
although
he
got
most
of
his
answers
wrong
he
did
definitively
identify
what
the
important
questions
are
i
think
it
was
descartes
who
said
that
all
philosophy
is
just
a
footnote
to
plato
if
i
were
to
choose
which
philosopher
made
the
most
important
advances
in
human
knowledge
over
his
lifetime
thats
simpleit
is
aristotle
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
many
simply
refer
to
him
as
the
philosopher
regarding
nietzsche
hes
one
of
the
most
entertaining
although
since
his
ideas
were
so
fragmented
and
since
his
life
was
cut
short
it
is
doubtful
that
his
influence
as
a
philosopher
is
likely
to
be
very
extensive
years
from
now
theyll
probably
still
be
reading
him
in
years
though

for

philosophers
i
would

to

that
kant
was
the
most
influential
since
he
had
such
a
strong
influence
on
almost
everyone
who
came
after
him
and
unfortunately
they
maintained
his
errors
and
amplified
them
over

i
would

that
the
most

american
philosopher
would
have
to
be
dewey

as
to
the
question
of
what
philosopher
will
be
most
highly
regarded
in

it
may
very
well
be
ayn

who
in

lack

that
means
that
much
more
energy
would

required
for
the

to
function
the

also
supply
leverage
points
for

thats
why
you
dont

no
energy

just
for

also
allow
a
creature
to
produce
large
forces
with
weak
muscles
using
the
principle
of
a
hydraulic
jack
rather
than
a
lever
this
is
one
of
those
yes
but
things
its
true
that
a
hydraulically
pressurized
tube
can
be
somewhat
more
rigid
than
an
unpressurized
tube
but
even
at
psi
levels
a

will
bend
rather
easily
though
its
straighton
compressive
strength
is
high
and
its
torsional

is
practically
nil
on
the

theres
no
doubt
that
hydraulic
leverage
exists
in
nature
tree
roots
are
an
example
given
time
they
can
shatter
concrete
as
osmotic
pressure
increases
its
interesting
to
note
that
on
land
creatures
are
either
two
legged
or
legged
with
tiny
insects
having
or
legs
but
never
legged
though
that
would
be
a
stable
configuration
it
can
be
argued
that
legged
creatures
kangaroos
are
the
specific
number
of
limbs
a
creature
has
is
an
accident
of
evolution
it
is
hard
to
make
changes
in
some
structures
the
panda
has
a
thumb
plus
as
many
fingers
as
its
ancestors
five
on
each
hand
but
the
thumb
is
a
modified
wristbone
rather
than
a
modified
finger
and
extra
fingers
are
much
more
common
than
extra
limbs
especially
fullyfunctional
ones
kangaroos
i
dont
think
so
if
you
take
the
view
that
the
tail
is
a
limb
then
monkeys
and
kangaroos
are
i
think
the
tail
is
a
different
kind
of
structure
grossly
enlarged
in
the
case
of
the
kangaroo
but
primarily
still
an
instrument
of
balance
rather
than
locomotion
i
dont
know
much
about
panda
thumbs
so
ill
ask
is
it
opposable
thermodynamic
considerations
of
surfacevolume
relationships
would
seem
to
dictate
that
active
complex
creatures
stay
in
a
size
range
similar
to
what
we
see
about
us
inch
tall
intelligent
aliens
seem
unlikely
as
do
those
much
larger
than
the
elephant
why
cant
a
lemur
or
a
brontosaurus
be
intelligent
yes
i
know
that
the
brontosaurus
is
a
mythical
beast
produced
by
putting
the
head
of
another
dinosaur
on
an
apatosaurus
but
so
far
space
aliens
are
also
mythical
well
i
wont
say
flat
out
that
they
cant
be
intelligent
but
ill
bring
a
couple
of
lines
of
argument
to
bear
to
try
to
show
why
i
dont
think
its
likely
first
let
me
say
that
when
i
say
intelligent
i
mean
complex
behaviors
in
response
to
novel
situations
on
a
level
with
or
greater
than
human
tool
use
and
tool
building
ie
assuming
suitable
manipulators
are
present
on
the
creature
to
allow
it
to
alter
its
enviroment
in
a
planned
way
it
will
do
so
thats
certainly
not
a
universal
or
complete
definition
of
intelligence
but
it
will
suffice
for
a
putative
technological
alien
now
no
one
knows
exactly
what
makes
a
brain
capable
of
thought
but
its
generally
accepted
that
one
of
the
criteria
is
a
certain
level
of
complexity
this
is
generally
determined
by
the
number
of
neuron
cells
and
their
interconnections
so
a
creature
the
size
of
a
lemur
wouldnt
have
enough
neurons
to
support
complex
thought
this
argument
is
considerably
less
clear
in
the
case
of
the
dinosaur
theres
room
for
a
large
brain
though
no
indication
that
one
ever
developed
one
reason
this
may
be
true
is
neuronic
speed
the
electrochemical
messages
that
trigger
neurons
require
time
to
propagate
this
makes
it
difficult
for
a
highly
complex
central
brain
to
coordinate
the
movements
of
very
large
creatures
so
theres
little
selection
pressure
for
such
brains
instead
a
simpler
distributed
network
evolves
this
doesnt
rule
out
intelligent
dinosaurs
but
it
points
in
that
direction
then
there
are
the
thermodynamic
arguments
a
tiny
creature
like
the
lemur
needs
to
eat
frequently
because
its
internal
heat
is
rapidly
lost
due
to
its
high
surface
to
volume
ratio
i
contend
that
a
creature
that
must
spend
most
of
its
time
and
energy
feeding
wont
have
the
time
to
develop
and
exercise
intelligence
that
argument
may
be
somewhat
weak
the
dinosaurs
problem
is
the
reverse
it
must
moderate
its
heat
production
because
its
high
volume
to
surface
ratio
makes
it
tend
to
retain
waste
heat
im
assuming
that
a
certain
temperature
range
is
optimal
for
chemical
reactivity
reasons
for
productive
neuron
function
so
creatures
would
tend
to
need
to
maintain
a
regulated
temperature
in
a
range
near
that
of
humans
if
they
are
carbon
based
that
tends
to
rule
out
cold
blooded
creatures
as
potential
homes
of
intelligence
some
people
contend
that
some
of
the
dinosaurs
may
have
been
warm
blooded
but
for
a
creature
the
size
of
a
brontosaur
its
activity
levels
would
have
to
be
restrained
or
it
would
be
prone
to
generate
an
internal
steam
explosion
from
the
waste
heat
whales
are
similar
size
but
they
can
reject
heat
to
the
ocean
a
much
more
efficient
sink
than
air
i
suspect
that
for
intelligence
to
manifest
itself
a
certain
degree
of
activity
in
interacting
with
the
environment
is
necessary
ie
monkey
curiousity
i
doubt
a
large

orbit
very
roughly
the

cost
as

smallish

therefore
if
such

were
to
become
common
place
that
would
have
to
be
a
very
low
price
this
is
nonsense
its

every

have
their

theres
always
been
a
problem
of
having
to
get
away
from
civilization
before
you
can
really
find
natural
scenery
years
ago
this
usually
didnt
take
a
trip
of
over
miles
today
most
people
would
have
to
go
miles
or
more
if
we
ever
get
to
the
point
where
we
have
billboards
on
orbit
that
essentially
means
that
no
place
on
earth
is
still
wild
while
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
the
orbital
billboards
arent
the
problem
they
are
just
a
symptom
of
growing
denselypopulated
civilization
banning
such
ads
will
not
save
your
view
of
the
night
sky
because
by
the
time
such
ads
could
become
widespread
you
will
probably
have
trouble
finding
a
place
without
street
lights
where
you
can
see
the

the
rest
of
your

is
strange
mishmash
of

really
bad

it

if

astronomers
have
just
built
groundbased
scopes
and
are
studying
designs
for
larger
ones
seriously
though
youre
never
going
to
get
a
scope
into
orbit
as
cheaply
as
you
can
build
one
on
the
ground
and
with
adaptive
optics
and
a
good
site
the
difference
in
quality
is
narrowed
quite
a
bit
anyway
also
scopes
in
low
orbit
like
hubble
can
only
observe
things
continuously
for
minutes
at
a
time
which
can
be
a
serious
limitation
opacity
and
distortions
caused
by
the
atmosphere
itself
have
driven
most
of
the
field
to
use
radio
far
infrared
or
spacebased
telescopes
in
any
case
a
bright
point
of
light
passing
through
the
field
doesnt
ruin
observations
if
that
were
the
case
the
i
sure
as
hell
does
if
the
point
of
light
is
half
a
degree
in
extent
and
as
bright
as
the
moon
have
you
ever
noticed
how
much
brighter
the
night
sky
is
on
a
moonlit
night
thousands
of
existing
satellites
would
have
already
done
so
satelliets
might
not
seem
so
bright
to
the
eyes
but
as
far
as
astronomy
is
concerned
they
are
extremely
bright
existing
satellites
are
points
of
light
but
an
advertising
sign
that
appeared
as
a
point
would
be
useless
so
i
rather
think
these
will
appear
larger
than
a
typical
satellite
also
satellite
tracks
are

of

fc
that

take

up

microns

i
dont

about

most

have

so
there
are

a

just
told
me
an
interesting
story
about
dcx
an
air
force
costing
team
just
looked
at
the
dcx
now
called
the
btw
and
gave
an
estimate
on
how
much
it
would
cost
the
air
force
to
build
it
it
cost
sdio
to
build
and
it
would
cost
the
usaf
million
or
four
and
a
half
times
as
much
id
be
willing
to
bet
that
a
majority
of
the
cost
difference
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
afs
requirement
for
superfluous
documentation
or
huge
requirements
and
design
reviews
travel
expenses
flying
personnel
around
to
meetings
and
over
specifying
the
hardware
i
doubt
that
the
actual
fabrication
cost
in
materials
and
labor
would
be
very
different
from
sdios
costs
of
course
this
is
my
cynical
opinion
based
on
years
of
watching
the
government
procurement
process
try
to
cover
up
a
lack
of
creativity
and
innovation
with
reams
of

this

not

enjoyment
of

sky
it
would
be
invisible
at

nor
would
it
have
any
significant
impact
on
astronomical
observations
i
suspect
there
must
be
some
kind
of
underlying
agenda
coming
to
the
surface
when
in
spite
of
this
people
are
so
quick
to
shrilly
denounce
and
condemn
something
that
would
so
vividly
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
lazlo
nibble
sez
buying
lichtenstein
and
paving
it
over
with
ground
glass
would
also
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
but
that
doesnt
make
it
a
particularly
attractive
idea
is
that
what
this
country
has
been
reduced
to
the
planetary
equivalent
of
a
guy
who
gets
his
penis
out
at
parties
actually
paving
ground
glass
over
lichtenstein
wouldnt
demonstrate
the
strength
of
western
capitalism
since
its
strength
depends
on
use
of
the
mind
and
materials
in
the
fulfillment
of
needs
and
desires

dont
quite
follow
you
on

part
about

exposing

so

he

would
approximate

while
im
sure
sagan
considers
it
sacrilegious
that
wouldnt
be
because
of
his
doubtfull
credibility
as
an
astronomer
modern
groundbased
visible
light
astronomy
what
these
proposed
orbiting
billboards
would
upset
is
already
a
dying
field
the
opacity
and
distortions
caused
by
the
atmosphere
itself
have
driven
most
of
the
field
to
use
radio
far
infrared
or
spacebased
telescopes
hardly
the
keck
telescope
in
hawaii
has
taken
its
first
pictures
theyre
nearly
as
good
as
hubble
for
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
cost
in
any
case
a
bright
point
of
light
passing
through
the
field
doesnt
ruin
observations
if
that
were
the
case
the
thousands
of
existing
satellites
would
have
already
done
so
satelliets
might
not
seem
so
bright
to
the
eyes
but
as
far
as
astronomy
is
concerned
they
are
extremely
bright
i
believe
that
this
orbiting
space
junk
will
be
far
brighter
still
more
like
the
full
moon
the
moon
upsets
deepsky
observation
all
over
the
sky
and
not
just
looking
at
it
because
of
scattered
light
this
is
a
known
problem
but
of
course
two
weeks
out
of
every
four
are
ok
what
happens
when
this
billboard
circles
every
minutes
what
would
be
a
good
time
