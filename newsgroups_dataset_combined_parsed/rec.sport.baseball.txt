any

ive
read
all
of
the
followups
to
this
but
i
thought
id
go
back
to
the
original
article
to
make
specific
comments
about
the
method
jaomegatestcom
john
oswalt
said
he
has
obtained
the
play
by
play
records
in
computer
readable
form
for
every
major
league
baseball
game
for
the
past
several
years
he
devised
an
algorithm
which
i
call
sumoversituations
and
wrote
a
computer
program
to
calculate
every
major
league
players
contribution
using
it
it
works
like
this
look
at
every
situation
in
every
game
in
a
baseball
season
a
situation
is
determined
by
inning
score
where
the
baserunners
are
and
how
many
outs
there
are
for
each
situation
count
how
many
times
the
team
eventually
won
the
game
that
the
situation
occured
in
and
divide
by
the
number
of
times
the
situation
came
up
to
come
up
with
a
value
for
that
situation
this
was
first
done
by
george
lindsey
in
the
late
and
reported
in
article
an
investigation
of
strategies
in
baseball
author
george
r
lindsey
journal
operations

issue
volume
julyaugust
pp
later
pete
palmer
did
the
same
thing
using
simulated
seasons
to
generate
a
larger
set
of
data
to
avoid
the
kind
of
smallsample
anomalies
that
other
people
have
worried
about
he
reported
this
in
thehiddengameofbaseball
with
john
thorn
gary
skoog
modified
the
method
a
bit
and
did
some
work
on
what
he
called
a
value
added
measure
based
on
these
situational
values
his
were
based
directly
on
marginal
runs
though
not
on
win
probabilities
these
results
as
applied
to
the
season
were
reported
in
one
of
the
bill
james
baseball
abstract
books
help
me
out
here
somebody
for
example
a
situation
might
be
inning
score
runner
on
second
and
no
outs
there
were
regular
season
major
league
games
last
year
with
the
rockies
and
marlins
there
will
be
more
this
year
say
this
situation
came
up
in
of
those
and
the
team
ahead
won
of
them
then
the
value
of
this
situation
is
description
of
method
look
at
change
in
win
probability
based
on
the
at
bat
plus
any
baserunning
and
creditdebit
the
player
by
that
amount
each
time
he
gets
a
plate
appearance
now
for
each
player
sum
up
all
his
atbat
and
baserunning
values
for
the
season
to
obtain
an
overall
value
for
that
player
obviously
the
sum
of
all
players
values
for
each
game
and
for
the
season
as
a
whole
will
be
thats
only
because
you
always
credit
x
to
the
batter
and
x
to
the
pitcher
theres
no
validation
involved
ok
theres
a
very
big
problem
here
that
nobody
has
yet
commented
on
youre
adding
probabilities
and
probabilities
dont
add
runs
you
can
add
the
total
team
runs
breaks
down
into
how
many
runs
joe
contributed
plus
how
many
runs
fred
contributed
etc
but
probabilities
dont
work
that
way
if
bob
increases
his
teams
chance
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
that
does
not
mean
that
bob
increased
his
teams
chance
of
winning
by
in
fact
it
doesnt
mean
anything
because
the
units
are
screwy
i
agree
and
disagree
john
is
saying
that
the
batters
efforts
will
result
in
more
wins
then
losses
while
you
are
probably
correct
that
does
not
mean
more
wins
then
losses
it
means
something
i
would
rather
have
a
player
who
increased
my
teams
chances
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
then
i
would
a
player
who
increased
my
chances
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
thus
there
appears
to
me
to
be
an
obvious
positive
association
between
johns
statistic
and
winning
games
thus
before
you
disregard
this
stat
it
appears
to
me
that
further
study
must
go
into
what
sort
of
relationship
there
is
consider
an
example
bob
hits
a
solo
hr
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
about
on
your
scale
he
does
the
same
thing
again
in
the
fourth
with
the
score
tied
for
another
and
again
in
the
seventh
with
the
score
tied
for
another
and
finally
in
the
ninth
to
win
the
game
by
a
score
of
for
a
value
of
bob
hit
solo
hr
in
plate
appearances
and
was
credited
by
your
method
with
but
what
does
that
mean
was
bob
responsible
for
the
win
certainly
not
the
defense
is
always
responsible
if
you
include
pitching
in
that
and
bob
wasnt
pitching
in
fact
bob
was
only
of
the
offense
which
is
a
lot
but
not
even
close
to
furthermore
what
about
the
other
team
runs
say
they
all
came
on
solo
hr
by
fred
then
fred
was
hitting
hr
to
tie
up
the
game
which
are
just
as
valuable
as
hr
to
take
the
lead
see
lindsey
and
fred
will
himself
have
accrued
a
good
rating
or
so
so
fred
and
bob
combined
have
amassed
of
a
win
in
one
game
theres
clearly
a
problem
here
the
only
problem
here
is
an
insistance
that
these
number
mean
exactly
how
many
wins
the
team
has
first
we
are
using
averages
over
many
seasons
and
applying
them
to
one
game
second
remember
some
players
performance
take
away
from
the
chance
of
you
winning
that
is
a
player
who
gets
an
out
gets
a
negative
probability
in
most
cases
thus
im
not
sure
in
any
given
game
when
you
add
up
all
the
numbers
for
a
team
who
won
that
they
will
add
up
to
in
that
game
sometimes
they
will
add
up
to
more
then
one
sometime
less
than
one
also
the
pitchers
bad
performances
giving
up
runs
may
have
given
them
a
large
negative
percentage
for
that
game
also
any
batter
that
pulled
an
night
would
give
large
negatives
greg
thinking
about
the
right
things
but
his
intuition
is
off
the
mark
closers
are
enormously
important
the
total
number
of
runs
value
is
outweighed
by
when
they
come
or
are
prevented
from
comming
the
doubling
which
greg
allows
is
not
enough
in
another
article
i
proposed
a
test
of
this
we
can
predict
a
teams
wonlost
record
quite
accurately
by
looking
at
how
many
runs
total
they
score
and
allow
without
regard
to
when
those
runs
score
in
the
game
if
late
runs
are
really
more
important
than
early
runs
then
looking
only
at
late
runs
should
lead
to
a
better
predictor
right
no
but
really
only
because
you
have
a
smaller
sample
size
i
would
think
however
that
the
number
of
runs
you
score
in
the
first
inning
would
be
just
as
good
as
a
prediction
as
how
many
runs
you
score
in
the
last
inning
and
realize
something
else
a
closer
usually
comes
in
in
a
close
situation
not
a
blow
out
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
any
runs
that
a
closer
gives
up
in
a
game
have
equal
importance
to
those
given
up
in
the
first
inning
look
a
closer
giving
up
runs
often
means
a
team
will
lose
many
games
on
the
other
hand
a
starter
who
gives
up
runs
often
still
leaves
his
team
a
chance
to
win
the
offence
has
many
more
outs
to
do
something
about
but
i
am
not
saying
all
late
inning
situations
are
equally
important
either
if
i
am
down
runs
in
the
ninth
it
really
does
not
matter
how
many
runs
my
pitcher
gives
up
in
the
ninth
heres
another
thought
experiment
apply
this
method
to
basketball
what
you
find
is
that
points
scored
in
the
first
half
of
the
game
have
almost
exactly
no
value
because
no
lead
is
safe
with
an
entire
half
yet
to
play
furthermore
the
sub
in
off
the
bench
who
sinks
the
winning
free
throws
with
no
time
on
the
clock
gets
a
for
the
game
while
the
star
forward
who
scored
points
in
the
first
half
before
spraining
his
ankle
gets
a
zero
does
this
make
sense
no
but
why
would
you
assume
that
the
teams
probability
of
winning
would
be
before
the
possesion
in
which
the
free
throws
were
made
look
if
you
are
down
point
with
seconds
left
there
is
a
fairly
high
probability
that
you
will
win
the
game
if
you
are
in
possesion
of
the
ball
and
do
not
forget
that
somebody
elses
missed
shots
turnovers
fouls
bad
defense
etc
caused
a
negative
chance
that
the
team
would
win
from
reading
all
of
the
discussion
on
this
statistic
i
feel
that
those
who
critisize
it
to
a
certain
extent
are
doing
so
out
of
an
agenda
at
first
look
this
statistic
valadates
clutchness
but
it
really
does
not
cluthness
revolves
around
the
idea
that
certain
players
in
crucial
situation
elevate
their
performance
and
others
performance
goes
down
ive
never
seen
convincing
proof
that
this
really
happens
so
if
you
assume
there
is
no
clutchness
then
that
means
that
except
for
a
lot
of
noice
this
statistic
has
a
positive
association
to
player
performance
there
is
a
way
to
get
rid
of
the
noice
if
you
do
not
believe
in
clutchness
certainly
we
could
find
out
what
the
average
value
of
a
home
run
is
for
example
we
may
find
for
instance
that
a
home
run
increases
your
chance
of
winning
by
on
average
while
a
strikeout
decreases
your
chance
of
winning
by
i
bet
if
this
were
done
we
would
find
that
this
statistic
was
just
as
good
as
other
statistics
we
have
for
predicting
wins
and
losses
how
do
we
evaluate
relief
pitchers
say
john
and
sam
have
the
exact
same
pitching
statistics
runs
earned
runs
ks
bbs
etc
both
had
exceptional
numbers
john
however
only
pitched
in
closer
situations
while
sam
was
a
mop
up
man
who
was
more
valuble
to
their
team
probably
john
who
was
the
better
pitcher
they
were
probably
about
the

of

players
earn
as

as

is

cut
some
players
like
kenny
lofton
chris

keith
mitchell
tim
wakefield
and
a
bunch
of
pitchers
all
of
whom
could
have
arguably
made
the
team
better
at
a
cost
of
million
for
the
lot
of
them
the
total
team
salary
is
averaging
slightly
over
a

if
thats
too
steep
you
can
dump
thomas

replacing
them
with

a

note
much
of
this
posting
is
from
personal
observation
yesterday
in
a
game
where
the
regulars
were
mostly
pulled
after
several
innings
winfield
may
have
big
holes
in
his
defensive
game
that
didnt
show
up
he
didnt
have
to
pick
any
bad
throws
for
example
but
ill
take
what

hi
all
ive
been
locked
in
a
small
closet
chained
to
a
lab
bench
for
the
last
week
or
two
without
access
to
really
important
information
i
saw
the

back
on

long
is
he
out
for

how
many

will
he
get
this

nothing
personal
against
higuera
mind
you
just
wondering
how
bud
can
keep
coffing
up
money
for
him
when
he
lets
current
big
producers
go
over
a
relative
pittance
please
realize
the
term
relative
pittance
can
only
be
used
with
sarcasm
when
discussing
baseball
salaries
additional
questions
i
didnt
get
to
see

is

a
less
wellpublicized
part
of
the
now
infamous
darrin
jackson
for
derek
bell
trade
was
the
fact
that
san
diego
included
in
the
deal
even
less
publicized
than
this
however
was
that
the
didnt
come
from
the
padres
but
from
an
unnamed
source
and
that
the
money
didnt
go
to
the
blue
jays
in
toronto
the
money
was
diverted
into
a
london
bank
account
owned
by
a
shadowy
character
named
vincent
gray
i
should
be
so
lucky
the
account
number
must
have
been
rejected
the
odd
thing
was
that
gray
wasnt
some
british
financier
but
a
canadian
social
scientist
working
at
the
university
of
western
ontario
gray
was
previously
known
to
the
authorities
only
as
an
associate
of
john
palmer
and
as
the
man
who
had
the
previous
year
discovered
the
true
tater
name
of
bing
bang
ben
macdonald
to
be
accurate
it
is
big
bang
ben
macdonald
soon
after
that
gray
and
palmer
sent
word
to
ottawa
that
canada
had
achieved
absolute
superiority
over
the
united
states
in
the
field
of
baseballistic
research
as
she
controlled
both
the
ackercook
pitchalike
contest
and
the

the

i
hope
not
to
think
that
i
would
inadvertantly
give
any
pleasure
to

really

my

ps
matthew

a
marvellous
ending
to

okay
so
im
not
giving
up
the

job
but
in
an
effort
to
help
me
keep
the

ive
managed
to
foist

bbddd
vince
can
take
this

as
the
cue
to
chime
in
about
what
he
plans
to
do
as
the
new
director
of
the
research
institute
and
what
kind
of
body
armor
ontarians
are
wearing
this
spring
meanwhile
i
have
to
go
pick
up
that
truckload
of

boucher
cards
i
bought
to
fill
in
the
area
behind
our
tool
shed
jking
realizing
the
taterific
importance
of
this
work
john
palmer
and
i
concluded
that
we
might
be
able
to
pool
some
resources
i
have
not
yet
gone
through
the
archives
that
jonathan
sent
to
me
when
i
do
i
will
send
out
an
official
introduction
to
the
deep

derby
however
i
wonder
if
we
need
to
rename
the
project
now
that
the
principal
investigator
and
research
archive
have
changed
send
your
suggestions
for
a
rename
of
the
study
to
me
at
the
address
given
above
and
just
think
its
opening
day
soon
the
balls
will
be
flying
out
no
get
your
minds
out
of
the
gutter
of
the
ball
parks
and
helpless
bystanders
will
be
injured
by
balls
reentering
the
atmosphere
and
you
thought
that

were
made

who
will

this

can
anyone
hope
to

the

the

the

ending
the

teams
are
starting
to
realize
that
you
dont
have
to
pitch
to
schmidt
or
torrienti
and
that
is
lowering
their
run
total
it
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
klein
and
dick
allen
who
platoons
with
chuck
klein
and
occasionally
spells
rose
at

and
its
a
credit
to
the
phillies
that
theyve
been
able
to
sustain
their
pace
the
picthers
have
slumped
at
times
so
came
the
analysis
from
frank
chance
the
cubs
got
that
run
back
when
bell
bunted
for
a
hit
thomas
grounder
moved
him
to
second
and
after

billy

singled
home

singled
him

entered
to
face
fox

dick
allen
popped
out
of

to

allen
doubled
to
right
but
luckily
for
the
cubs
williams
had
moved
to
left
and
andre
dawson
had
been
inserted
for
defense
he
fired
a
bullet
to
home
plate
to
keep
klein
at
third
lance
parrish
hitting
for
boone
was
walked
and
bruce
sutter
entered
larry
bowa
grounded
into
a
double
play
but
ed
delahanty
walked
as
a
pinchhitter
desiring
a
strikeout
since
ashburn
was
likely
to
attempt
a
bunt
hit
with
the
quick
trillo
pinchrunning
at
third
chance
brought
in
lee
smith
who
induced
a
popup
to
the
catcher
from
the
speedy
centerfielder
ending
the
inning
the
cubs
took
the
win
moving
a
game
behind
the
phillies
steve
carlton
was
called
upon
to
battle
brown
saturday
to
get
another
righthander
in
the
lineup
ron
santo
moved
to
first
and
bill
madlock
played
third
unfortunately
brown
allowed
six
doubles
and
the
cub
bullpen
was
worn
down
even
more
as
the
cubs
tried
to
maintain
a
lead

i

may

them

in

like

the
worst
thing
is
to
play
in
a
pitchers
park
like
this
spoke
gil
hodges
before
the
series
keith
hernandez
added
that
their
defense
takes
away
quite
a
few
runs
per
year
and
it
must
be
giving
them
an
extra
wins
the

have
made
only
errors

the

looked
even
better
mcgriffs

even
rising
of
course
the
bench
was
very
poor
and
joe
gordon
was
only
adequate
in

these
were

hurled
a
scoreless

tom

was
working
his

when

out
and
joe

was
pitched
around
thurm
munson
doubled
both
runners
home
and

a

the

sweep
had
pulled

into
a
tie
with
the

though
the

denied
it
the
highly
emotional

another

a

doubleheader

the

sent
joe

in

normally
drysdale
remarked
i
would
be
challenging
hitter
by
being
ready
to
throw
at
them
i
cant
afford
to
with
this
team
though
we
have
to
get
our
own
runners
going
we
cant
afford
to
let
the
astros
beat
us
he
then
winked
and
said
well
maybe
davis
will
get
decked
once
the
fact
that
glenn
davis
leads
the
team
in
homers
with
six
is
primarily
why
he
would
be
decked
but
it
should
be
understood
that
his
current
pace
would
give
him
nine
for
the
season
the
hitting
on
this
team
is
a
little
better
but
the
power
is
all
doubles
and
triples
still
carl
furillo
is
the
main
reason
no
astro
home
runs
were
hit
over
the
weekend
as
he
threw
two
runners
out
trying
for
insidethepark
homers
for
those
unaware
of
the
nastness
of
the
astros
park
they
have
a
high
gray
wall
all
around
the
outfield
balls
must
be
hit
into
the
seats
to
be
home
runs
the
foul
poles
are
feet
from
home
plate
but
the
alleys
are
feet
away
with
center
field
at
feet
its
as
if
some
threeyearold
threw
a
tantrum
and
told
his
playmates
if
i
cant
hit
home
runs
nobody
will
hit
home
runs
remarked
roy
campanella
the
dodgers
stole
five
bases
friday
but
the
astros
decided
to
revitalize
the
baltimore
chopping
that
had
failed
weeks
before
for
tonight
anyway
davis
jim
wynn
and
jose
cruz
did
not
have
to
mess
with
their
swings
according
to
the
manager
after
poles
and
willie
wells
reached
base
via
the
baltimore
chop
drysdale
decked
jose
cruz
with
a
pitch
he
responded
with
a
tworun
double
but
wynn
playing
first
for
davis
popped
up
and
the
astros
didnt
score
any
more
in
that
inning
they
did
score
in
the
fourth
to
erase
a
deficit
and
the
astros
wound
up
winning
they
threatened
to
do
even
better
the
next
game
as
tommy
john
would
be
their
opponent
walt
alston
met
privately
with
the
starters
at
am
before
the
game
i
think
i
know
how
we
can
beat
the
baltimore
chop
he
explained
how
can
we
do
that
pee
wee
reese
wondered
theyre
going
to
be
beating
the
ball
down
so
weve
got
to
be
ready
to
throw
on
the
run
steve
will
start
at
first
to
dig
balls
out
of
the
dirt
but
i
want
all
of
you
to
practice
your
barehanded
picks
and
throws
well
go
with
a
shallow
infield
almost
the
whole
time
the
plan
almost
worked
mike
scott
allowed
only
two
runs
through
eight
innings
but
the
astros
got
three
two
of
them
scored
when
bill
doran
pushed
a
bunt
into
the
outfield
in
the
fourth
with
runners
on
second
and
third
astros
was
the
final
with
dave
smith
earning
another
save
the
dodgers
scored
a
victory
in
the
first
game
of
the
twin
bill
sunday
as
nolan
ryan
walked
five
three
of
whom
scored
in
a

fernando
valenzuela
lost
the
second
game
to
don
sutton
however
as
the
dodgers
thirteen
stolen
bases
in
the

proved
to
not
be
enough
were
mostly
a

this

the
way
it
has
always
been
several
detailed
studies
of
this
have
been
done
and
theyve
all
shown
that
players
arent
coming
up
any
younger

older
than
in
the
past
and
they
arent
playing
any
more

less
in

than
they
used
to
the
only
thing
that
shifts
is
our
memories
of
the
good
old
days
damn
i
was
afraid
you
would
say
that
but
all
after
the
fact
which
makes
it
not
applicable
to
the
current
discussion
which
is
about
how
you
decide
whether
to
play
the
rookie
who
hasnt
established
himself
in
the
majors
over
the
mediocre
veteran
the
padres
played
santiago
that
year
because
they
clearly
had
nobody
else
worth
playing
well
perhaps
if
the
braves
had
no
one
else
worth
playing
this
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
others
worth
playing
at
least
in
their
opinion
and
i
happen
to
agree
both
of
these
young
men
were
highly
touted
defensive
catchers
expected
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
baseball
not
by
recsportbaseball
consensus
that
may
sound
like
an
incredibly
arrogant
comment
but
ive
found
that
the
sdcn
consensus
when
one
exists
is
right
far
more
often
than
the
media
consensus
or
the
opinions
of
baseball
people
affiliated
with
mlb
i
can
believe
that
im
a
newbie
here
so
ill
take
your
word
but
alomar
is
a
fine
defensive
catcher
which
was
my
statement
above
that
is
a
solid
reason
for
bringing
him
up
at
a
tender
age
as
long
as
they
feel
he
can
also
hit
a
bit
lopez
does
not
have
such
a
consensus
about
his
defensive
prowess
and
imho
that
is
enough
to
give
him
that
dreaded
seasoning
i
dont
know
who
knows
i
suppose
the
same
people
or
similar
who
know
he
will
be
better
than
some
other
catcher
these
are
of
course
just
differing
opinions
i
read
that
his
arm
is
not
that
strong
i
suppose
somewhere
there
is
some
measurement
of
sb
ratios
and
that
he
is
still
learning
to
call
a
game
that
latter
skill
may
be
difficult
to
project
on
someone
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
his
performance
but
it
is
a
tangible
skill
i
disagree
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangible
skill
any
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deny
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catchers
may
be
much
better
than
others
at
it
but
i
really
dont
see
any
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defense
is
eerily
accurate
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defensive
assessments
of
catchers
very
seriously
sorry
new
dont
know
nichols
law
dont
believe
in
catchers
era
but
i
am
interested
in
pitchers
eras
with
different
catchers
any
info
on
that
absolutely
the
evidence
is
piling
up
year
after
year
the
only
other
alternative
is
that
the
braves
really
dont
know
that
their
young
players
are
on
average
better
than
their
current
starters
im
not
ruling
out
that
kind
of
gross
incompetence
but
i
think
the
salaryschedule
explanation
is
more
charitable
in
other
words
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
only
logic
behind
a
different
decision
than
we
would
make
must
be
financial
i
presume
we
feel
this
way
about
other
franchises
than
atlanta
no
consider
we
know
that
the
braves
are
about
the
strongest
team
in
baseball
right
now
even
with
olson
and
lemke
and
nixon
and
bream
in
the
lineup
they
have
as
good
a
chance
of
repeating
as
champs
this
year
as
any
team
ever
has
it
actually
makes
some
sense
to
say
rather
than
making
our
team
marginally
better
this
year
by
bringing
up
the
young
studs
and
dumping
the
elderly
lets
go
ahead
and
compete
this
year
with
what
we
have
and
then
bring
up
the
studs
only
as
we
have
to
so
that
well
still
have
them
under
reserve
three
years
from
now
and
beyond
when
the
current
team
will
be
collecting
pensions
is
it
fair
to
the
young
players
no
does
it
make
organizational
sense
i
think
it
does
well
if
it
does
make
organizational
sense
one
can
hardly
fault
them
for
their
decisions
i
mean
please
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
business
especially
when
im
being
successful
c
i
could
make
it
or
wins
if
you
let
me
bring
up
lopez
s
listen
bobby
id
like
to
but
the
way
i
see
it
if
he
hits
the
big
club
this
year
well
be
paying
megaarbitration
bucks
down
the
road
in
a
couple
of
years
and
theres
no
way
i
want
to
do
that
and
continues
with
we
can
win
without
him
and
then
keep
winning
next
year
with
him
hows
that
im
sure
you
could
be
right
you
could
also
be
smoking
some
illegal
substance
hey
thats
a
joke
dont
get
offended
please
hey
id
love
to
be
wrong
about
this
if
you
think
its
unlikely
id
love
to
know
why
dont
cite
anybodys
innate
ethical
rectitude
though
unless
you
know
them
personally
well
i
cant
cite
anyones
ethical
rectitude
because
i
dont
know
what
it
means
but
again
if
it
makes
organizational
sense
then
so
be
it
baseball
is
a
business
and
if
there
is
a
solid
business
reason
for
keeping
lopez
on
the
farm
then
thats
what
the
braves
should
do
i
happen
to
believe
that
its
a
baseball
decision
while
you
from
your
armchair
may
disagee
i
dont
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
to
suggest
the
decision
they
made
i
predicted
it
among
large
guffaws
from
several
at
the
start
of
spring
training
i
think
it
is
a
very
normal
decision
to
have
made
it
is
certainly
more
reversible
than
to
have
started
lopez
in
the
bigs
and
have
released
one
of
their
catchers
sure
it
may
be
conservative
it
may
also
be
logical
i
dont
know
what
ethics
have
to
do
with
it
seems
like
pretty
good
common

i
was
watching
peter
gammons
on
espn
last
night
and
hes
got
me
a
little
confused
while
talking
about
expansion
he
started
mentioning
people
who
might
benefit
from
the
fringe
players
theyll
be
facing
mcgriff
hitting
home
runs
sheffield
getting
rbis
and
glavine
winning
games
this
was
of
course
all
in
reference
to
what
happened
the
other
times
that
baseball
has
expanded
early
late
late
what
really
confused
me
though
was
the
mention
of
al
players
who
would
do
well
next
year
specifically
roger
clemens
winning
games
and
the
likes
of
mcgwire
and
gonzalez
hitting
home
runs
my
question
is
how
in
the
hell
will
the
rockiesmarlins
help
the
al
the
last
time
i
looked
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
talent
jumping
leagues
did
i
miss
something
dennis
cleary
dfclearyucdavisedu
i
wondered
the
same
thing
when
he
first
mentioned
it
i
thought
he
was
just
making
a
mistake
but
then
he
said
it
over
and
over
and
then
in
the
examples
from
other
years
he
gave
stats
for
players
from
both
leagues
even
when
only
one
league
expanded
so
since
stats
never
lie
i
guess
there
is
an
effect
on
both
leagues
because
the
expansion
draft
takes
talent
from
both
leagues
equally
making
every
team
in
both
leagues
dilute
their
major
league
talent
by
calling
up
players
that
normally
they
would
not
have
had
there
not
been

me
well
maybe
it
will
be
banks
is
a
yearold
prospect
who
hasnt
matured
as
quickly
as
they
would
have
liked
mahomes
is
a
yearold
who
is
very
highly
touted
tapani
and
erickson
are
also
young

have
looked
very
good
this

the
last
spot
was
between
jim
deshaies
formerly
of
houston
and
sd
and
mike
trombley
deshaies
hasnt
looked
very
good
this
spring
so
i
believe
that
the
spot
has
gone
to
trombley
although
they
hadnt
wanted
starters
this
unproven
i
personally
believe
very
highly
in
mahomes
and
trombley

is

short

well
it
really
isnt
this
cut

as
a

fan
the
thing
i
feared
worst
has
happened
the
yanks
sent
down
williams
g
and
are
going
to
start
williams
b
in
cf
i
also
believe
they
kept
wickman
and
millitello
in
their
rotation
which
is
much
nicer
than
that
kaminiecki
and
mike
witt
combo
i
thought
theyd
throw
out
their
to
the
slaughterhouse
because
of
their
experience
granted
witt
might
be
good
but
i
think
that
they
used
rationale
to
keep
the
youngsters
up
and
not
given
the
job
to
witt
because
he
was
a
good
pitcher
and
has
experience
the
yanks
are
showing
that
they
are
taking
positive
strides
forwards
the
jays
with
the
loss
of
dave
stewart
are
looking

this

looked

converted

of

his

started
at

was
up
to

in
so
let
us
say
he
had
established
in
his

two

a
level
of
play
that
is
good
very
good
in

it
probably
doesnt

from
his

though
his

was
a

better
than
his

that
is
the
basis
for
the

about
him
being

the

would
have
you
beleive
he
was

i

he
was

maybe

both
that

why
do
you
say
that
it
sounds
like
youre
suggesting
bill
james
had
something
to
do
with
overhyping
the
kid
to
death
au
contraire
he
was
fairly
critical
of
him
after
his
roy
campaign
noting
that
he
wasnt
allworld
as
a
catcher
or
a
hitter
he
called
him
basically
average
when
everyone
else
in
the
media
was
predicting
the
next
johnny
bench
or
roy
campanella
both
of
these
young
men
were
highly
touted
defensive
catchers
expected
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
baseball
the
reports
i
read
indicate
that
lopez
is
very
ordinary
defensively
which
reports
are
those
the
dodgers
options
are
parrish
and
hernandez
and
now
only
carlos
piazza
is
as
long
as
he
continues
with
his
very
hot
bat
they
will
keep
him
in
the
lineup
because
they
need
the
offensive
production
when
he
cools
off
look
for
the
much
better
defensive
catcher
hernandez
only
to
play
more
i
like
hernandez
a
lot
but
if
piazza
can
catch
the
ball
youve
gotta
play
him
imho
hes
a
much
better
hitter
although
hernandez
isnt
a
bad
hitter
right
now
it
sounds
like
piazza
will
catch
most
of
the
time
and
hernandez
will
be
candiottis
caddy
since
he
can
catch
the
knuckler
as
long
as
they
play
up
to
their
abilities
the
dodgers
could
have
a
very
good
catching
tandem
the
braves
options
are
berryhill
and
olson
i
agree
that
olson
is
nothing
special
but
i
do
think
berryhill
is
better
than
many
people
on
rsb
believe
but
both
the
braves
catchers
are
very
good
defensively
calling
a
game
blocking
the
plate
throwing
and
although
they
are
somewhat
weak
offenivsively
they
play
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
think
both
are
overrated
defensively
see
nichols
law
of
catcher
defense
but
thats
something
thats
difficult
to
prove
or
disprove
from
your
viewpoint
or
mine
about
the
only
tangible
thing
we
can
look
at
is
opponents
sb
and
thats
clouded
by
how
well
your
pitchers
hold
runners
catchers
era
is
a
possibility
but
its
subject
to
way
too
many
biases
as
for
them
playing
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
disagree
here
too
about
the
only
chink
in
the
braves
armor
is
that
theyre
weak
offensively
at
several
positions
cf
c
ss
if
belliard
plays
unless
bream
and
hunter
form
another
superplatoon
and
very
weak
defensively
if
blauser
plays
id
like
to
see
the
braves
give
at
least
one
of
mel
nieves
javy
lopez

they

you

youre

thompson
and
incaviglia
dont
equal
wins
but
ill
take
the
two
of
them
over
stan
javier
and
ruben
amaro
ab
id
say
this
improvement
should
equate
to
wins
at

then
ill
take
lenny
dykstra
who
played

last

and
project
his
numbers
hits
hr
sb
over
games
hits
sb
okay
now
well
put
these
numbers
in
the
leadoff
hole
and
thus
i
have
to
bump
kruk
hollins
daulton
rbi
numbers
up
just
a

now
lesse
they
knocked
in
and
respectively
dont
you

its

to
add
about
or
rbi
to
each
they
managed
to
knock
in
a
pretty
nice
amount
of
runs
with
a
leadoff
hitter
okay
bozo
do
you
think
its

to

more
wins
now
oh
and
how
can
i
forget
wes
chamberlain
abs
hr
rbi
even
with
a

and
in
aaa
and
a
horrible
first
half
well
project
that
over
a
full
season
to
get
hr
and
rbi
or
so
is
that
worth
a
win
or
two
finally
take
the
worse

staff
in
the

last

add
the

decimation

now
we
add
danny

some

and
a

is

weve

were

just

lost

little

i
have
for

after
seeing
todays

of

how
could
he
start

the
way
may
played
at
the
end

and
the
way
he
tore
up
the

how
could
you
let
him
sit
the

not

that
a

maddux
started
i
really
blew
my

when
lefebvre
pinch
hit
for

with

how
can
you
do
that
just
because
of
the
leftyrighty
thing
too
much
is
made
of
that
wilkins
is
twice
the
hitter
that
shields
is
then
the
next
batter
was
jose
vizcaino
one
of
the
weakest
hitters
i
have
ever
seen
and
who
had
looked
terrible
at
bat
all
day
and
lefebre
let
him
hit
while
may
still
sat
the
bench
i
think
even
arnie

was
stunned
by
this
because
he
showed

producing
incredibly
now
but
in
the
long
run
he
will
never
put
up
the
numbers
that
sandberg
has
for
this

alomar
may
be
the
best
but
overall
sandberg
wins
out
by
a
long
shot
when
sandberg
was
alomars
age
he
was
putting
up

with
no

alomars
oba
is

higher

sandbergs
career
high
alomars
career
high
in
doubles

triples
is
higher

sandberg
is
still
better
than
alomar
but
only
because
alomar
hasnt
reached
his
full
potential
yet
alomars
got
a

he
has

sandberg
didnt

the

specifically
roger

winning

the

the

okay
im

still
the

actually
had

say
that
one
out
of
every
six
pitchers
in
the
nl
this
year
did
not
pitch
in

last

huh
imo
this
expansion
will
not
see
the
explosive
jump
in
offense
that
the
other
expansion
drafts
had
since
the
talent
was
diluted
over
both
leagues
in
gammons
defense
because
the
talent
drain
came
from
the
al
as
well
some
increase
will
be
seen
he
also
gets
credit
for
mentioning
that
the
jump
in

was

also

maj
this
is
what
jackson
looked
like
in
with
everything
converted
to
a
neutral
park
on
the
basis
of
run
production
his
equivalent
average
started
at
in
was
up
to
in
and
in
so
let
us
say
he
had
established
in
his
last
two
seasons
a
level
of
play
im
not
quite
sure
how
these
numbers
are
generated
it
appears
that
in
a
neutral
park
bos
hr
and
slugging
tend
to
drop
he
actually
loses
two
home
runs
or
do
they
what
is
equivalent
average
one
thing
when
looking
at
bos
stats
is
that
you
can
see
that
kc
took
away
some
homers
normally
you
expect
some
wouldbe
homers
to
go
for
doubles
or
triples
in
big
parks
or
to
be
caught
and
for
that
matter
you
expect
lots
of
doubles
and
triples
anyway
but
bo
despite
his
speed
hit
very
few
doubles
and
not
that
many
triples
so
i
would
expect
his
value
to
have
risen
quite
considerably
in
a
neutral
park
that
is
good
very
good
in
fact
but
it
probably
doesnt
make
the
top
ten
in
the
league
the
best
eqa
in
the
al
in
was
dave
winfields
thomas
was
first
at
first
in

nl
was
bonds
an
incroyable
tenth
was
bip
roberts
but
is
better
than
any
season
in
the
past
five
years
by
joe
carter
it
is
about
what
mattingly
had
in
what
felix
jose
had
the
last
two
years
just
ahead
of
time
raines
fiveyear
average
better
than
ryan
kleskos
mles
felix
jose
has
been
a
player
in
a
fairly
neutral
park
i
would
offhand
guess
the
bo
at
around
a
player
maybe
not
even
close
he
got
more
attention
from
the
media
than
was
warranted
from
his
baseball
playing
though
his
hype
was
a
lot
better
than
his
hitting
that
is
the
basis
for
the
netcomments
about
him
being
overrated
the
media
would
have
you
beleive
he
was
a
great
hitter
i
think
he
was
a
good
maybe
very
good
hitter
he
was
imo
something
like
the
best
hitter
in
the
majors
id
put
him
about
there
too
note
i
hadnt
realized
the
media
had
hyped
him
so
much
i
thought
he
was
always
viewed
by
them
as
a
better
football
player
and
only
soso
at
baseball
he
did
only
have
one
season
and
kc
wasnt
winning
note
i
maybe
have
harped
on
this
a
bit
in
the
past
but
there
is
a
mistake
being
made
by
the
sdcns
as
they
are
known
on
this
group
with
respect
to
players
like
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
and
perhaps
others
we
find
that
if
you
look
at
a
large
group
of
players
their
past
major
and
minor
league
numbers
will
predict
their
future
numbers
fairly
well
their
are
some
caveats
the
younger
they
are
the
less
good
the
prediction
the
lower
the
minor
league
the
less
good
i
imagine
the
more
recent
the
player
has
left
college
ball
etc
now
of
course
this
prediction
involves
quite
a
bit
of
error
sometimes
a
player
with
poor
mles
dave
justice
the
ventura
becomes
a
star
some
hitters
develop
shane
mack
brian
downing
some
dont
oddibe
mcdowell
mickey
brantley
this
error
involves
real
things
there
are
real
reasons
why
oddibe
didnt
hit
and
shane
did
it
may
who
knows
involve
parks
and
batting
coaches
and
wheaties
and
injuries
and
lifting
and
so
on
but
still
you
have
this
big
pool
of
players
and
things
work
pretty
well
one
of
the
reasons
for
these
predictions
accuracy
is
the
common
background
of
the
players
one
thing
we
know
about
professional
baseball
players
is
that
all
of
them
or
almost
all
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
playing
ball
their
backgrounds
are
similar
what
hasnt
been
established
is
what
happens
when
you
encounter
a
player
with
a
different
background
is
there
some
reason
to
believe
that
a
bo
or
a
deion
or
a
lofton
or
a
tony
gwynn
or
an
ainge
or
so
on
has
such
a
different
background
that
the
standard
model
and
standard
assumptions
fit
this
person
slowly
it
hasnt
been
established
that
you
can
use
mles
with
twosport
players
it
hasnt
been
established
that
you
cant
but
then
statistics
is
after
all
an
art
i
personally
think
otherwise
lucid
individuals
continually
make
completely
nonsensical
statements
about
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
look
at
those
goodbutnotgreat
minor
league
numbers
they
say
well
what
happens
if
those
numbers
simply
dont
mean
what
they
usually
mean
it
might
mean
that
ken
lofton
suddenly
has
a
better
year
in
houston
than
tuscon
it
might
mean
that
deion
suddenly
has
a
better
halfyear
in
atlanta
than
greenville
then
again
it
might
not
ken
and
deion
might
go
right
back
in
the
tank
this
year
live
up
to
those
poor
mles
but
you
guys
dont
know
whats
worse
you
dont
know
that
you
dont
and
you
dont
know
that
there
are
other
players
you
wont
know
about
injuries
and
lifting
and
wheaties
again
you
seem
to
think
that
the
model
is
perfect

eternal

find

better

has

just

the

usually

changes
their

uniform
change
per

but
the
past

have
been
incredible
any
thoughts
on
the
new
old
reds
uniforms
i
remember
seeing
a
pete

rookie
card
and
unless
i
miss
my
guess
he
was
wearing
the
exact
same
duds
the
mets
how
about

today
have
reinserted
the
mets
patch
on

changed
the

insgnia
on
the
front
of
the
jersey
to
my
knowledge
it
is
the
first
time
that
has
been
changed
since
and
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
the
dodger
logo
as
far
as
i
know
toronto
pittsburgh
and
new
york
nl
change
their
uniforms
every

every

year
eg
new

it
will
say
mets
in
cursive
new
york
in

new
york
in

minor
changes
but
they
do
change
them
often
last
year
i
think
they
had
new
york
in
all
caps
did
toronto
have
blue
jays
or
toronto
last
year
what
about
pittsburgh
many
teams
have
opted
for
a
return
to
a
previous
style
of
uniform
or
at
least
uniforms
that
look
more
traditional
phillies
reds
expos
white
sox
padres
etc
and
the
once
bright
colors
have
been
altered
to
gray
the
trend
has
also
seen
the
newer
baseball
fields
resembling
the
parks
of
the
early
years
as
opposed
to
the
cookiecutter
saucer
stadiums
construcrted
throughout
the
sixties
i
hate
the
gray
they
should
opt
for
more
color
like
the
white
sox
i
hate
white
team
versus
gray
team
spring
training
uniforms
look
much
better

mark

said
we
know
that
very
very
few
players
at
this
age
make
much
of
an
impact
in
the
bigs
especially
when
they
havent
even
played
aaa
ball
yes
but
this
is
irrelevant
youre
talking
about
averages
when
we
have
lots
of
information
about
this
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decisions
on
i
might
as
well
say
we
know
that
very
very
few
people
are
more
than
feet
tall
so
chances
are
that
manute
bol
is
really
only
foot
no
maybe
i
need
to
improve
my
writing
skills
lopez
who
is
very
ordinary
defensively
is
not
likely
to
hit
so
well
at
age
having
not
played
at
aaa
level
that
it
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
rush
him
into
the
braves
lineup
in
why
isnt
lopez
likely
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjusting
his
stats
for
park
and
league
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolute
scale
than
olson
or
berryhill
did
by
a
lot
as
for
rushing
if
there
really
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
the
minors
and
the
majors
that
requires
a
period
of
adjustment
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
waste
lopezs
old
good
season
than
his
old
very
good
season
or
his
excellent
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclimated
the
more
of
his
prime
you
get
to
use
lopez
was
hitting
over
ab
when
he
was
cut
from
spring
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
gee
i
dont
know
abs
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
about
as
good
as
your
reasoning
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
every
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
as
a
gm
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
ok
most
players
are
not
ready
for
the
bigs
at
age
most
players
are
never
ready
for
the
bigs
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
javy
lopez
most
players
benefit
rather
than
being
stagnant
or
hurt
by
playing
at
aaa
see
above
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
but
i
could
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
frank
thomas
or
barry
bonds
most
players
arent
that
good
so
they
probably
wont
be
that
good
this
year
either
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
and
demonstrated
inabilities
to
hit
their
way
out
of
a
soap
bubble
not
superstars
mind
you
but
solid
experienced
veterans
not
superstars
not
stars
not
even
good
players
maybe
average
if
were
being
charitable
the
braves
have
a
very
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bats
in
the
outfield
an
excellent
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candidate
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hitting
shortstops
ummm
justice
is
a
very
fine
hitter
pendleton
might
have
another
big
year
in
his
bat
but
he
might
also
spend
the
season
in
hamstring
hell
gant
is
a
big
question
mark
the
breamhunter
platoon
is
decent
not
excellent
and
has
rotten
obp
or
slg
depending
on
whos
in
blauser
is
a
very
valuable
bat
for
a
shortstop
the
center
field
platoon
will
probably
hit
however
good
lopez
bat
might
be
given
the
above
it
wont
be
so
much
better
than
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differential
in
experience
and
defensive
ability
wanna
bet
the
difference
between
lopezs
bat
and
olsonberryhill
could
be
or
runs
over
the
course
of
the
season
given
a
choice
between
a
player
with
experience
and
a
player
who
can
play
ill
take
the
latter
every
time
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchell
did
i
am
just
so
surprised
i
have
to
spell
all
of
this
out
my
goodness
do
you
believe
the
other
poster
who
thinks
lopez
is
being
held
down
because
of
his
future
earning
potential
that
was
me
and
you
so
far
your
only
counterproposal
is
that
they
really
dont
understand
how
good
lopez
is
or
overvalue
experience
or
some
combination
of
the
two
i
think
my
interpretation
was
more
flattering

david

writes
well
perhaps
if
the
braves
had
no
one
else
worth
playing
this
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
others
worth
playing
at
least
in
their
opinion
catcher
is
their
weakest
position
with
the
possible
exception
of
second
base
they
have
a
chance
to
simultaneously
replace
their
biggest
offensive
problem
spot
with
a
wellaboveaverage
offensive
player
and
acclimate
a
highly
promising
potential
star
with
no
pressure
on
him
to
carry
the
team
and
they
want
to
play
olson
and
berryhill
instead
i
disagree
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangible
skill
any
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deny
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catchers
may
be
much
better
than
others
at
it
but
i
really
dont
see
any
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defense
is
eerily
accurate
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defensive
assessments
of
catchers
very
seriously
sorry
new
dont
know
nichols
law
a
catchers
defensive
reputation
will
be
inversely
proportional
to
his
recent
offensive
level
of
performance
thus
mickey
tettleton
goes
in
the
media
from
being
a
nohit
defensive
whiz
to
a
slugging
thumbfinger
in
two
short
years
the
rule
doesnt
apply
to
perceived
superstars
who
get
the
gold
glove
offensive
transfer
effect
instead
greg
olson
is
probably
considered
to
be
a
good
defensive
catcher
precisely
because
he
cant
hit
dont
believe
in
catchers
era
but
i
am
interested
in
pitchers
eras
with
different
catchers
arent
they
the
same
thing
in
other
words
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
only
logic
behind
a
different
decision
than
we
would
make
must
be
financial
either
that
or
just
stupidity
i
presume
we
feel
this
way
about
other
franchises
than
atlanta
no
of
course
is
it
fair
to
the
young
players
no
does
it
make
organizational
sense
i
think
it
does
well
if
it
does
make
organizational
sense
one
can
hardly
fault
them
for
their
decisions
i
mean
please
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
business
especially
when
im
being
successful
one
could
make
the
same
sort
of
argument
in
other
cases
pete
rose

pursuing
ty
cobbs

the

say
he

he
will
be
the
one
hurting
the

will
still
win
without
him
will
they
you
cant
usually
take
away
one

best
players
and
still
expect
them
to
win
or
do
you
think
the

will
continue

without
barry

remeber
many
of
these

have
nothing
if
not
for
their
athletic
ability
nothing
they
are
getting
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working

and
they
are
complaining

not

pay
so
again
jack
nicholson
gets
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
much
more
than
rickey
henderson
for
that
matter
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
them
making
millions
my
problem
is
when
the
say
they
arent
being
paid
enough
when
they
already
get
millionalso
their
numbers
get
worse
the
reason
the
latter
often
happens
is
that
many
of
these
folks
start
making
the
real
big
salaries
late
in
their

when
they

there

not
a

you
can
keep
a

on
the
for
as
long
as
you
want
if
hes
still
certified
as
injured
the
player
must
be
periodically
reevaluated
to
determine
if
hes
still
injured
thus
you
cannot
park
a
player
on
the
dl
who
maybe
is
out
of
options
and
you
do
not
wish
to
expose
to
waivers
if
you
get
someone
qualified
for
the
that
reduces
the
frequency
of
reevaluations
there
is
no
longer
i
believe
any
limit
to
the
number
of

can
place
on

at

make
much
of
an

in
the

especially
when
they
havent
even
played

ball
yes
but
this
is
irrelevant
youre
talking
about
averages
when
we
have
lots
of
information
about
this
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decisions
on
do
you
really
have
that
much
information
on
him
really
why
isnt
lopez
likely
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjusting
his
stats
for
park
and
league
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolute
scale
than
olson
or
berryhill
did
by
a
lot
i
dont
know
you
tell
me
what
percentage
of
players
reach
or
exceed
their
mles
in
their
rookie
season
were
talking
about
you
know
as
for
rushing
if
there
really
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
the
minors
and
the
majors
that
requires
a
period
of
adjustment
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
waste
lopezs
old
good
season
than
his
old
very
good
season
or
his
excellent
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclimated
the
more
of
his
prime
you
get
to
use
if
that
were
your
purpose
maybe
offerman
spent
getting
acclimated
if
you
will
the
dodgers
as
a
team
paid
a
big
price
that
season
perhaps
they
will
reap
the
benefits
down
the
road
do
you
really
think
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
if
they
were
competing
for
a
pennant
lopez
was
hitting
over
ab
when
he
was
cut
from
spring
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
for
a
stathead
im
amazed
that
you
put
any
credence
in
spring
training
did
you
notice
who
he
got
those
hits
off
of
or
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
it
doesnt
make
a
difference
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchell
did
wait
a
minute
i
missed
something
here
first
forget
keith
mitchell
are
you
saying
that
a
kid
who
moves
from
aa
to
aaa
and
then
does
not
improve
would
have
been
better
off
making
a
direct
leap
to
the
majors
if
a
player
does
well
at
aa
and
then
does
not
improve
at
aaa
isnt
that
a
sign
that
maybe
he
doesnt
belong
in
the
bigs
now
keith
mitchell
as
i
recall
no
stat
books
handy
surprise
he
jumped
from
aa
to
atlanta
in
he
did
so
well
that
he
was
returned
to
the
minors
where
he
didnt
do
very
well
at
all
now
his
career
is
in
jeopardy
so
how
does
he
fit
in
with
your
point
good
mles
in
aa
moved
him
right
to
the
big
club
now
hes
one
step
away
from
being
traded
or
moved
out
of
baseball
duh
that
was
me
and
you
so
far
your
only
counterproposal
is
that
they
really
dont
understand
how
good
lopez
is

overvalue

some
combination
of
the
two
i

my

was

you

as
well
inject
a
little
more
fuel
to
the
flame
back
at
the
beginning
of
spring
training
i
though
lopez
would
make
the
squad
easily
olson
was
still
recovering
from
his
lateseason
injury
knee
i
believe
and
there
were
questions
as
to
whether
he
would
be
able
to
play
before
june
and
then
berryhill
was
dinged
up
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
because
i
believe
that
lopez
can
hit
and
field
the
position
before
last
season
he
was
the
braves
defensive
catcher
prospect
while
brian
deak
was
the
braves
offensive
catcher
prospect
besides
olson
and
berryhill
couldnt
hit
their
way
out
of
a
wet
cardboard
box
and
dont
walk
enough
to
be
useful
but
olson
recovered
quickly
berryhill
recovered
and
the
braves
went
with
the
two
vets
i
still
say
that
if
one
of
those
two
had
been
down
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
wouldnt
have
gotten
his
job
back
there
is
a
certain
logic
to
keeping
olson
and
berryhill
around
after
all
ml
catchers
are
in
short
supply
and
suffer
from
wear
and
tear
there
are
teams
out
there
without
one
average
ml
catcher
california
and
seattle
come
to
mind
certainly
trying
to
move
olson
or
berryhill
through
waivers
would
be
unlikely
to
work
plus
youd
have
to
eat
that
salary
which
isnt
huge
but
isnt
tiddleywinks
either
i
think
olsons
at
about
berryhill
at
but
thats
only
what
i
recall
yes
i
think
arbitrationeligibility
may
have
a
role
to
play
in
this
also
what
is
it
that
of
the
players
arent
eligible
for
arbitration
only
the
that
were
on
the
roster
the
longest
are
eligible
of
course
the
system
may
change
but
the
extent
of
that
change
is
not
yet
known
from
a
business
standpoint
it
may
make
sense
to
keep
lopez
down
until
junethe
first
time
olsonberryhill
go
on
the
dl
i
am
still
disappointed
that
lopez
isnt
on
the
team
i
still
prefer
to
think
of
myself
as
a
fan
when
it
comes
to
the
braves
and
the
truth
is
that
id
rather
see
our
best
team
on
the
field
which
imo
includes
lopez
of
coursetoday
we
play
the
cubs
hopefully
we
wont
need
him
as
for
the
schuerholzcox
conversation
i
imagine
it
went
like
this
remember
theyve
both
been
gms
the
following
is
not
meant
to
be
read
by
the
humorimpaired
cox
ok
weve
sent
jones
down
his
fielding
could
be
a
little
smoother
besides
blauser
can
hit
ok
and
his
fielding
is
better
than
it
used
to
be
schuerholz
well
well
have
to
send
nieves
down
too
deion
just
wont
sign
that
baseball
only
contract
we
cant
count
on
him
in
october
so
we
have
to
keep
nixon
around
for
the
defense
besides
gormans
not
ready
to
give
up
on
billy
hatcher
yet
once
hatchers
gone
and
deion
signs
we
can
move
nixon
for
frankie
rodriguez
that
ought
to
give
us
some
pitching
depth
in
cox
yep
thatll
be
nice
too
bad
deion
wont
sign
ok
ill
look
for
nieves
when
justice
starts
having
berryberryer
back
problems
again
now
what
about
klesko
schuerholz
well
weve
still
got
to
fork
out
another
mil
for
bream
if
we
keep
klesko
we
either
lose
the
money
or
cabrera
i
keep
dangling
sid
in
front
of
dal
maxwell
but
somehow
he
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
same
gm
first
jeffries
for
jose
and
now
whiten
for
clark
if
he
gets
rid
of
brian
jordan
then
id
have
to
believe
that
he
and
whitey
herzog
switched
bodies
at
the
winter
meetings
cox
ok
keep
trying
on
bream
and
ill
wait
til
the
trading
deadline
for
my
hunterklesko
platoon
maybe
i
can
get
a
few
extra
atbats
for
cabrera
while
we
wait
try
california
if
snow
starts
slowly
maybe
whiteydal
will
bite
on
sid
and
if
that
doesnt
work
then
perhaps
sids
knees
could
be
persuaded
to
act
up
theres
always
the
dl
mwahahahaha
schuerholz
what
about
caraballo
cox
well
hes
not
that
much
better
than
lemke
maybe
if
he
starts
in
richmond
hell
start
walking
more
besides
if
hes
going
to
be
arbitrationeligible
better
to
stretch
him
out
so
that
we
actually
get
some
value
from
him
before
he
makes
the
big
bucks
schuerholz
now
lets
see
that
leaves
lopez
cox
nooooo
i
gotta
keep
lopez
sure
i
didnt
think
olson
would
recover
this
quickly
maybe
i
can
talk
caminiti
into
running
into
him
again
schuerholz
nope
lopez
has
gotta
go
you
know
that
hell
get
million
in
arbitration
may
as
well
put
it
off
that
one
extra
year
besides
until
olsons
shown
his
stuff
a
little
bit
i
cant
trade
him
besides
berryhills
a
lefthanded
hitter
you
know
how
rare
that
is
cox
dont
you
mean
a
lefthanded
whiffer
pretty
common
if
you
ask
me
i
mean
he
made
pat
borders
look
good
in
the
world
series
pat
borders
schuerholz
hey
youre
the
one
who
wouldnt
write
lopez
into
the
lineup
cox
well
youre
the
one
who
went
out
and
got
me
jeff
reardon
besides
i
thought
lopez
wouldnt
be
used
to
our
pitching
staffs
stuff
he
got
some
time
with
them
this
springlooked
pretty
good
come
on
surely
we
only
need
to
keep
one
stiff
behind
the
plate
schuerholz
yeah
but
which
stiff
whichever
one
we
keep
will
be
hurt
by
may
cox
ok
ok
you
made
your
point
keep
them
both
surely
one
of
them
will
be
on
the
dl
by
june
at
the
latest
then
i
can
call
up
lopez
and
then
we
can
win
games

shortstop
vizcaino

even

dave
magadan

has
a

buechelle
has
more
power

i

edge

santiago

ok

santiago
is
better

to
marlins
left
field
conine
vs
maldonadowow
for
yesterdayi
know
conine
has
potential
i
watched
him
play
at
omaha
the
last
couple
years
until
he
actually
proves
himself
i
give
maldonado
the
edge
however
like
at
this
is
position
where
florida
might
be
even
or
better
if
the
player
there
has
a

center
scott

to
may
even
if
wilson
hopefully
the

will

save
wilson

running
and
the
like

isnt
ken
griffey

he
will
hit
with
homers
if
he
plays
full
time
right
felix
vs
sosafelix
jose
has
occasional
power
and
a
bad
obp
so
does
sosa
but
sosa
also
has
speed

a
good

edge
to

aquino
armstrong
hammond
a
lot
of
fifth
starters
here
the

wont
remind
anyone
of

morgancastilloguzmanhibbard
is
average
to
okbetter
than
the

edge
to

middle
relief
even
the
cubs
have
some
decent
middlemen
and
so
do
the
marlins
carpenter
anf
klink
or
decent
but
so
are
assenmacher
and
mcelroy
closer
a
healthy
harvey
is
a
big
edge
to
the
marlins
meyers
is
decent
but
no
harvey
of

the
cubs
may
have
a
few
more
games
to
save
look
for

blown
from
meyers
and
saves
blown

a

florida
overall
an

i
dont
know
but
some
idea
can
be
gotten
by
looking
at
the
runs
scored
in
mile
high
stadium
during
the
last
few
years
of
the
bearszephyrs
tenure
in
the
american
association
heres
the
total
runs
scored
per
game
in
zephyrs
games
all
league
games
and
the
ratio
i
found
the
same
ratios
for
hr
year
rpg
lea
ratio
hrpg
lea
ratio
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
denver
will
have
a
large
effect
on
runs
scored
ill
stick
with
my
prediction
from
last
year
that
itll
be
one
of
the
top
in
the
nl
this
year
and
a
fairly
large
effect
on
homeruns
though
apparently
not
as
large
as
atlanta
wrigley
cincinnati
and
san
diego
still
it
ought
to
be
a
pretty
decent

here
is
where

dead

not

nicely

i
dont

that

will
be
able
this
may
be
an
appropriate

the
yankees
finshed
and

and
games
out

they
also
finished
second

they
were

games
out
even
great

can
lose
thats
why
they
play
the

on
the
other
hand
im
still
picking
the
braves
to
go
all
the
way
um
surely
you
didnt
intend
to
compare
the
reds
with
the
philidelphia
as
the
yankees
were
finishing
to
a
team
that
was
as
good
as
the
yankees
while
the
yankees
had
aged
some
from
their
peak
years
ruth
and
gehrig
couldnt
play
every
position
simultaneously
imo
given
the
various
ages
of
the
braves
and
reds
this
season
that
the
braves
will
be
closer
to
their
peak
while
the
reds
have
slightly
passed
their
peak
also
if
youre
going
to
compare
braves
and
yankees
a
more
appropriate
comparison
to
the
braves
might
be
the
yankees
after

especially
when

yes
but
this
is
irrelevant
youre
talking
about

when
we
have
lots
of
information
about
this

in

to
base
our
decisions
on
do
you
really
have
that
much
information
on
him
really
i
dont
personally
but
clay
just
posted
it
yes
we
do
unfortunately
it
shows
that
lopez
wasnt
as
good
an
example
as
nieves
would
have
been
since
his
last
year
numbers
were
out
of
line
with
the
previous
years
which
i
didnt
have
access
to
the
point
remains
though
knowing
a
guys
minor
league
history
is
as
good
as
knowing
his
major
league
history
if
you
know
how
to
read
it
why
isnt
lopez
likely
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjusting
his
stats
for
park
and
league
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolute
scale
than
olson
or
berryhill
did
by
a
lot
i
dont
know
you
tell
me
what
percentage
of
players
reach
or
exceed
their
mles
in
their
rookie
season
were
talking
about
you
know
the
mle
is
not
a
projection
its
an
equivalence
its
a
this
is
how
well
he
hit
last
year
in
major
league
terms
rating
so
in
essence
he
has
already
reached
it
i
would
guess
bob
clay
that
essentially
half
of
all
players
surpass
their
previous
mles
in
their
rookie
seasons
maybe
more
than
half
since
all
of
these
players
are
young
and
improving
if
that
were
your
purpose
maybe
offerman
spent
getting
acclimated
if
you
will
the
dodgers
as
a
team
paid
a
big
price
that
season
did
they
offerman
may
have
been
the
difference
between
or
place
and
last
place
but
no
more
perhaps
they
will
reap
the
benefits
down
the
road
do
you
really
think
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
if
they
were
competing
for
a
pennant
sure
they
didnt
have
anyone
better
i
suppose
they
might
have
gutted
the
farm
system
to
acquire
jay
bell
or
spike
owen
or
somebody
if
they
were
really
in
contention
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
for
a
stathead
im
amazed
that
you
put
any
credence
in

training
if
youd
read
what
i
wrote
youd
be
less
amazed
nowhere
do
i
claim
to
put
any
credence

quite
the
contrary
i
said
that
lopez
hadnt
done
anything
that
even
the
bozos
who
do
put
credence
in
spring
training
could
interpret
as
failure
just
because
i
think
spring
training
numbers
are
meaningless
doesnt
mean
that
bobby
cox
does
its
just
a
case
of
ruling
out
one
possible
explanation
for
sending
lopez
down

re

most
of

has
been
between
mark
singer
and
david
tate
with
valentine
weighing
in
on
the
same
side
as
dave
at
various
times
my
opinion
fwiw
to
all
mark
age
doesnt
matter
ability
does
i
would
rather
have
the
untried
rookie
with
great
minor
league
numbers
than
the
veteran
who
has
proven
himself
to
be
average
at
best
i
dont
care
if
he
is
if
he
plays
better
than
what
i
have
i
want
him
out
there
sandy
alomar
had
decent
minor
league
numbers
grossly
inflated
by
the
pcl
in
general
and
las
vegas
in
particular
he
should
have
been
projected
as
an
average
major
league
hitter
which
is
good
for
a
catcher
ill
admit
santiagos
numbers
would
probably
come
out
the
same
as
sandys
but
i
dont
have
the
league
data
from
the
to
check
it
out
that
being
said
i
agree
with
sending
lopez
to
richmond
at
least
to
start
the
season
as
the
box
below
shows
he
has
one
minor
league
season
in
which
he
hit
well
he
has
two
in
which
he
hit
very
very
poorly
i
want
to
see
that
the
lopez
is
real
olson
and
berryhill
are
not
complete
mediocrities
for
catchers
especially
nl
catchers
they
are
essentially
average
hitters
with
equivalent
averages
around
if
he
had
hit
well
at
prior
levels
i
would
say
he
belongs
on
the
braves
but
there
is
a
reasonable
chance
that
lopez
last
year
was
just
as
much
a
fluke
as
alomar
in
or
santiago
in
one
year
at
any
level
at
any
age
doesnt
satisfy
my
standards

evidence

the
ops
alone
indicates

at

with

he
has
a

of

and
above

for

which
was
about
in

he
has
shown
at

the
potential
of
going
into
the
which
would
make
him
one
of
the
best
hitters
in
the
league
he
has
two
full
seasons
before
reaching
his

should
be

given
for
this
also
i
just
noticed
something
looking
at
the
nolan
ryan
timeline
in
the
preview
on
rickey
henderson
became
nolans
strikeout
on
he
pitched
his
nohitter
against
oakland
i
believe
the
last
out
in
the
game
was
made
by
rickey
henderson
and
on
nolan
pitched
his
nohitter
on
the
same
day
a
certain
someone
stole
his
base
which
overshadowed
it
it
seems
that
nolan
is
having
a
lot
of
publicity
at
rickeys
expense
imo
rickey
deserves
it
and
it
seems
as
most
of
the
net
agrees
with
me
from
what
ive
seen
on
it
lately
they
are
both
great
players
but
imo
nolan
has
outclassed
rickey
both
in
playing
and
more
importantly
in
attitude
just
my
thoughts

as
for
rushing
if
there
really
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
the
minors
and
the
majors
that
requires
a
period
of
adjustment
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
waste
lopezs
old
good
season
than
his
old
very
good
season
or
his
excellent
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclimated
the
more
of
his
prime
you
get
to
use
can
anybody
name
a
player
who
was
rushed
to
the
majors
lets
for
arguments
sake
define
rushed
as
brought
up
to
the
majors
for
more
than
a
cup
of
coffee
prior
at
age
or
younger
and
performing
below
expectations
whose
career
was
damaged
by
this
rushing
im
serious
i
tend
to
agree
with
david
that
bringing
the
player
up
sooner
is
better
but
id
like
to
look
at
players
for
whom
this
theory
didnt
work
if
there
are
any
id
prefer
players
within
the
last
years
or
so
because
then
i
can
look
up
their
minor
league
stats
its
important
to
distinguish
between
players
who
legitimately
had
careers
below
what
their
minor
league
numbers
would
have
projected
as
opposed
to
players
who
were
hyped
and
failed
but
actually
had
careers
not
out
of
line
with
their
minor
league
numbers
lets
kick
it
off
with
an
example
of
a
player
who
was
rushed
although
there
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
any
damage
to
his
career
jay
bell
was
given
pas
in
the
major
leagues
at
age
and
performed
well
below
what
you
would
expect
from
his
aaa
numbers
the
same
season
he
got
pas
the
next
year
at
age
and
still
underperformed
however
the
next
year
at
age
his
performance
improved
and
he
won
the
everyday
shortstop
job
and
has
been
there
ever
since
its
really
hard
for
me
to
see
where
he
would
have
been
better
off
staying
in
the
minor
league
where
he
was
performed
quite
well
in
aaa
during
this
time
rather
than
being
rushed
cleveland
might
have
been
better
off
i
suppose
because
they
might
have
been
less
likely
to
give
up
on
him
yes
if
you
bring
a
player
up
early
hes
likely
going
to
struggle
but
does
that
delay
the
time
at
which
he
stops
struggling
and
starts
performing
up
to
expectations

the

a

to

his

mssnetcomcom
mark
singer
said
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
this
is
the
crux
of
the
argument
to
me
at
least
both
the
sdcn
and
the
nonsdcn
camps
seem
to
agree
on
the
fact
that
a
catchers
defense
is
basically
nonmeasurable
at
present
you
can
talk
about
how
important
calling
a
game
is
or
framing
the
pitches
or
blocking
balls
in
the
dirt
but
there
is
little
or
no
way
to
tell
exactly
how
various
catchers
rank
in
defense
looking
at
lopez
specifically
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
that
he
is
a
bad
defensive
catcher
other
then
the
fact
that
the
braves
or
the
media
has
labeled
him
a
bad
defensive
catcher
as
far
as
i
can
tell
he
doesnt
have
any
particular
problem
in
his
mechanics
such
as
sasser
he
might
be
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
in
blocking
the
ball
or
framing
the
pitch
to
get
a
good
call
but
all
he
needs
to
clear
that
up
is
playing
and
practice
time
i
cant
see
how
repetitions
at
aaa
are
any
better
then
reps
in
the
majors
all
were
left
with
is
the
calling
the
game
aspect
olsen
and
berryhill
at
always
given
credit
for
calling
good
games
and
helping
the
pitchering
staff
but
this
is
a
reputation
that
is
given
to
almost
all
veteran
catchers
how
is
catching
at
aaa
going
to
help
lopez
learn
the
major
league
pitching
staff
the
only
way
any
catcher
is
going
to
learn
tom
glavines
pitches
is
to
catch
tom
glavine
similarly
i
wouldnt
be
supprised
if
the
pitchers
claimed
to
prefer
pitching
to
olsen
over
pitching
to
lopez
because
they
are
used
to
pitching
to
olsen
but
given
time
they
will
say
they
are
comfortable
with
lopez
now
since
lopez
cant
learn
how
to
handle
the
major
league
pitchers
while
hes
in
aaa
and
since
he
doesnt
have
any
glaring
problem
in
his
mechanics
what
is
he
going

that
he

al

why
the

well
i
pondered

hard
and
it
all
came
down
to
this
the
blue
jays
are
going
the
wrong

cant
bring
myself
to
pick
the

milwaukee

a
fluke

bad
last

didnt

any
better
detroits
pitching
will
be
the
new
definition
of
replacement
level
but
you
dont
really
think
the
orioles
will
win
do
you
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
cant
see
any
team
in
the
american
league
winning
either
division
on
paper
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
yankees
who
i
hate
but
some
body
has
to
win
so
i
pick
the
orioles
you
dont
really
think
that
brady
anderson
is
going
to
repeat
do
you
no
im
basing
the

from
ian
m
derby
i
was
watching
the
dodgersmarlins
game
yesterday
and
a
couple
of
things
impressed
me
first
is
that
the
way
the
sun
was
shining
in
miami
it
had
a
summer
atmosphere
in
early
spring
for
baseball
in
comparison
wrigley
field
in
early
april
still
has
a
wintry
look
to
it
with
the
dead
ivy
and
bundled
up
fans
the
second
and
most
important
was
the
fans
i
like
these
guysgals
i
will
admit
i
am
a
football
fan
first
but
i
still
enjoy
baseball
it
was
interesting
because
most
of
these
fans
are
only
accustomed
to
the
miami
dolphins
the
way
they
were
cheering
i
thought
it
was
the
afc
playoffs
of
course
opening
day
may
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it
but
i
really
got
feeling
of
electricity
that
i
think
is
lacking
with
a
lot
of
baseball
fans
in
other
cities
baseball
certainly
needs
a
charge
and
i
hope
these
two
expansion
teams
bring
back
some
excitement
well
find
out
friday
how
denver
bronco
fans
respond
phillies
are
i
better
say
it
now
before
my
opportunity
passes
by
from
ian
m
derby
i
personally
will
never
forget
mike
schmidts
home
run
against
the
expos
in
that
decided
the
nl
east
it
was
also
his
career
high
another
home
run
that
i
thought
was
totally
incredible
was
in
the
alcs
the
ca
angles
had
the
boston
red
sox
strike
away
from
the
pennant
until
don
baylor
hit
a
two
strike
pitch
for
a
home
run
that
was
the
most
incredible
turn
of
events
i
have
ever
seen
in
baseball
the
sox
later
took
the
pennant
away
only
to
have
the
same
thing
done
to
them
in
the
ws
against
the
mets
speaking
of
the
mets
isnt
it
strange
how
the
nlcs
that
year
with
the
astros
almost
mirrored
the
nlcs
with
the
phillies
the
astros
have
been
painfully
close
twice
i
must
admit
from
ian
m
derby
this
talk
about
the
phillies
winning
the
nl
east
is
scary
very
scary
dont
get
me
wrong
im
a
phillies
fan
but
as
late
as
last
year
they
looked
helpless
the
funny
thing
was
they
did
have
a
lot
of
injuries
in
spring
training
that
basically
killed
their
chances
of
course
dont
forget
the
dykstra
wrist
injury
in
the
first
or
second
game
from
ian
m
derby
after
reading
my
local
paper
today
i
found
out
that
the
phillies
started
the
season
at
i
am
not
as
old
as
but
ive
heard
many
talk
about
the
serious
choke
job
the
phillies
did
that
season
they
were
ahead
of
the
cardinals
by
games
that
season
in
midaugust
they
managed
to
lose
a
bunch
from
then
on
and
the
cardinals
took
the
division
games
ahead
and
lost
it

this

a

prevented
just
as
a

saved
is

earned
enough
with

cliches
my
point
is
that
if
the
braves
starters
are
able
to
live
up
to
their
potential
they
wont
need
much
offensive
support
i
realize
this
is
a
big
if
this
staff
leaves
the
bosox
in
the
dust
there
is
no
legitimate
comparison
two
cy
young
winners
and
three
other
pitchers
that
most
any
team
in
the
league
would
kill
to
have
as
their
first
or
second
starter
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
they
should
have
many
low
scoring
games
due
to
their
excellent
pitching
and
below
average
hitting
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
starting
lineup
of
great
offensive
players
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
team
would
not
need
great
pitchers
they
would
have
an
advantage
because
they
could
simply
outscore
their
opponent
the
name
of
the
games
is
to
win
even
ray
knight
knows
that
you
do
this
by
putting
more
runs
up
on
the
scoreboard
all
im
trying
to
say
is
that
if
you
assemble
the
quality
pitchers
like
the
braves
have
the
offense
doesnt
need
to
be

so
far
sure
hes
hit
a

shots
and
he

any

you

far
cut
this

some

its

nope
they

finish

toronto
nope
dwight
gooden
wins

this

why
you

to

roger

tsk
tsk
not

to

something
like
this

and

drop

you

do
you

if

make

counter

against

they
follow
mets
come
in
third
behind
pittsburgh
and
montreal
okay
so
the

finished
fifth

i
got

jefferies

from
navarracasbahacnsnwuedu
mon
apr
from
tedwardcscornelledu
do
you
care
to
put
your
prediction
down
for
posterity
you
predict
mark
grace
will
get
rbis
i
say
you
are
out
of
your
mind
that
is
almost
impossible
for
a
type
guy
batting
behind
dawson
who
kills
most
of
the
rallies
he
doesnt
finish
why
do
you
say
that
mark
has
driven
in
and
last
year
mark
was
batting
second
primarily
and
it
was
his
worse
year
average
wise
since
he
is
batting
either
or
this
year
i
predict
he
will
be
back
up
to
his
previous
standards
i
think
he
will
be
better
rbis
is
not
that
much
of
a
stretch
sometimes
us
statheads
get
lucky
grace
didnt
hit
behind
dawson
the
entire
season
but
he
also
finished
with
only
rbis
from
tue
may
the
most
ballsy
prediction
ever
mark
mcgwire
will
hit
or
more
hrs
this
year
nope
he
slowed
down
and
the
injury
finished
him
off
didnt
even
reach
but
a
ballsy
prediction
nonetheless
from
ecaxronmarslercnasagov
thu
may
baltimore
will
not
fade
they
will
not
win
the
division
this
year
but
they
will
finish
within
five
games
i
find
the
prospect
of
two
orioles
winning
each
easier
to
comprehend
than
that
of
two
sox
no
offense
i
think
their
pitching
is
about
as
good
as
the
division
has
to
offer
the
orioles
finished
seven
games
out
none
of
them
won
though
mussina
might
have
had
a
chance
with
better
relief
and
more
starts
nobody
else
in
the
division
is
worth
a
darn
they
all
finish
a
minimum
of
fifteen
games
out
the
tribe
thats
another
reason
to
watch
baltimore
this
year
and
next
they
wont
waste
many
of
those
games
against
the
rest
of
the
division
except
for
the
brewers
who
you
probably
forgot
you
were
right
the
rest
of
the
division
was
thoroughly
mediocre
the
yankees
and
indians
led
with
wins
the
red
sox
trailed
with
wins
none
were
horrible
but
four
were
five
or
more
games
below
from
djohnsoncayleyuwaterlooca
david
johnson
date
thu
aug
gmt
right
that
was
me
i
never
said
the
jays
were
a
cinch
to
clinch
it
but
i
said
that
milwaukee
will
be
more
of
a
threat
than
baltimore
i
do
think
that
toronto
should
win
it
but
after
i
dont
consider
anything
a
cinch
unless
you
have
something
like
a
game
lead
with
games
to
go
i
do
think
that
the
jays
have
the
best
talented
team
in
the
al
east
and
if
we
had
a
good
or
even
average
manager
we
might
have
a
bigger
lead
right
now
i
also
think
that
the
orioles
will
not
play
much
better
than
baseball
for
the
rest
of
the
season
you
win
from

were

jose
rijo
will
win
the
cy
young
award
if
he
is
healthy
enough
to
go
at

ip
who
would
have
thought
he
would
try
to
steal
a
base
why
risk
such
an
injury
he
had
ip
but
didnt
win
the
cy
young
maddux
surprised
all
the
orioles
will
win
games
in
at
least
of
the
next
years
probably
the
last
and
their
pitching
staff
will
have
a
team
era
among
the
best
in
the
al
in
at
least
of
the
next
years
but
not
necessarily
all
the
same
years
as
they
win
this
one
will
take
a
long
time
to
verify
i
dont
think
i
want
to
wait
that
long
but
they
won
games
last
year
and
they
were
fifth
in
the
league
in
era
not
a
bad
start
ben
mcdonald
will
not
challenge
for
an
era
title
in
the
next
years
nor
will
he
have
victories
either
year
by
challenge
i
mean
finish
among
the
leaders
being
among
the
leaders
before
the
season
is
done
doesnt
count
he
will
probably
never
be
the
pitcher
he
was
hyped
to
be
but
is
still
a
decent
starter
to
have
looks
like
it
he
wasnt
bad
last
year
just
too
consistent
to
be
an
ace
so
far
this
year
looks
like
more
of
the
same
the
phillies
will
give
up
many
fewer
walks
ifwhen
they
get
rid
of
their
bullpen
coach
ryan
i
am
not
predicting
when
or
whether
they
will
get
rid
of
him
and
you
will
have
to
give
the
team
a
little
bit
of
time
to
adjust
before
seeing
the
radical
change
they
would
have
a
fine
pitching
staff
if
they
would
just
steal
ray
miller
away
from
pittsburg
the
white
sox
seem
to
have
the
same
problem
but
not
as
bad
i
honestly
cant
say
did
they
get
rid
of
him
their
bb
totals
were
down
last
year
ricky
jordan
will
have
rbi
if
he
starts
games
hitting
in
the
or
or
spot
in
any
lineup
or
the
spot
in
a
lineup
with
very
good
obp
in
the
hitters
this
applies
for
each
of
the
next
years

just
dont
think
hes
that
good
billy
ripken
will
never
again
hit
over
with

good

no

what

i
have
never
seen
a
starting
pitcher
who
can
only
strike
out

at

be
successful
in
the

current
plans
seem
to
be
to
use
quantrill
in

he
has
a

that

if

huge
and
expensive
problem
how
much
did
cal
sign
for

did

he

i

ron

manager
with

dunno

it

ive
found
the

why
are
the
red
sox
in

place
eight
games
into

they
already
have
two
wins
each
from
clemens
and
viola
clemens
starts
again
tonight
on
three
days
rest
whats
up
are
the
sox
going
with
a

rotation
is
this
why
hesketh
was
used
in
relief
last
night
hm
cheers
valentine
ps
i
was
wrong
the
sox
have
already
scored
runs
in
two
games
this

they
should
reach
without

still

every

as
important

a

is
just
as
important
as
a
run
prevented
just
as
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
enough
with
the
cliches
its
not
a
cliche
and
unlike
your
comments
below
its
not
a
tautology
it
neednt
have
been
true
if
every
pitcher
in
baseball
were
essentially
the
same
in
quality
ie
if
the
variance
of
pitching
ability
were
much
smaller
than
the
variance
of
batting
ability
then
scoring
runs
would
be
much
more
important
than
preventing
them
simply
because
the
ability
to
actively
prevent
runs
would
be
much
weaker
my
point
is
that
if
the
braves
starters
are
able
to
live
up
to
their
potential
they
wont
need
much
offensive
support
if
thats
your
point
you
should
have
said
so
what
you
in
fact
said
was
pitching
and
defense
win
championships
and
later
pitching
is
the
essence
of
baseball
neither
of
which
says
what
you
are
now
claiming
was
your
point
and
neither
of
which
is
true
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
and
you
accuse
sherri
of
mouthing
cliches
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
its
not
clear
to
me
at
all
that
this
is
true
in
highscoring
games
the
team
with
the
better
offense
wins
a
high
percentage
of
the
time
in
low
scoring
games
the
split
is
essentially
regardless
of
team
ability
they
should
have
many
low
scoring
games
due
to
their
excellent
pitching
and
below
average
hitting
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
starting
lineup
of
great
offensive
players
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
team
would
not
need
great
pitchers
i
thought
you
said
pitching
and
defense
win
championships
and
pitching
is
the
essence
of
baseball

spanky
isnt
very
good
defensively
anymore
hes
an
offensive
liability
and
judging
from
his
outburst
this
winter
after
the
bucs
failed
to
sign
drabek
hes
a
jerk
with
his
head
in
the
sand
tommy
prince
on
the
other
hand
cant
hit
in
the
paper
simmons
was
citing
the
case
of
tom
pagnozzi
who
never
hit
in
the
minors
or
majors
but
suddenly
somehow
learned
how
geez
dal
must
have
slipped
something
into
teds
drink
sometime
comparing
prince
to
pagnozzi
offensively
is
laughable
prince
has
never
hit
well
in
the
minors
and
hes
now
years
old
i
think
pagnozzi
was
not
a
bad
hitter
in
the
minors
ill
bring
in
the
numbers
tomorrow
assuming
i
dont
have
another
brain
cramp
and
forget
he
had
a
very
good
year
at
louisville
before
coming
up
to
the
majors
as
i
recall
the
hype
on
pagnozzi
coming
up
in
the
organization
was
good
hit
decent
fielding
when
he
got
to
the
majors
and
didnt
hit
as
well
as
expected
not
as
much
playing
time
he
became
exhibit
in
nichols
law
of
catcher
defense
and
got
the
reputation
as
an
outstanding
defensive
catcher
its
not
clear
he
ever
learned
to
hit
his
four
years
with
more
than
ab
born
july
year
ab
ba
slg
oba
no
power
lessthanleagueaverage
walks
peak
year
when
he
turned
now
declining
if
ted
is
going
to
invoke
pagnozzi
as
a
model
for
prince
given
that
prince
has
underperformed
pagnozzi
in
the
minors
its
not
a
rosy
picture
btw
im
still
unhappy
with
moving
zeile
who
had
the
same
reputation
coming
up
in
the
cardinal
organization
as
pagnozzi
except
that
he
was
a
much
much
better
hitter
to
where
he
could
be
an
average
hitter
and
a
below
average
fielder
instead
of
a

keeping

ill
hold
off

being
all
the
way
back
they
could
indeed
contend
but
that
would
count
on
atlanta
encountering
some
unforeseen
problems
such
as
injuries
or
keeping
up
their
early
season
abysmal
hitting
while
atlanta
has
the
undisputed
best
starting
rotation
i
feel
that
their
relief
staff
may
be
suspect
they
dont
have
a
real
closer
although
mike

has
been
used
in
that
role
didnt
stanton
start
off
great
last
year
and
then
falter
despite
this
your
point
is
well
taken
atlanta
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
personality
as
a
ny
team
thus
is
unlikely
to
selfdestruct
for
houston
to
take
em
atlanta
needs
to
suffer
some
injuries
particularly
to
their
starting
rotation
astros

corps
holding
together
if
doug
jones
keeps
his
changeup
effective
and
xavier
hernandez
can
be
effective
then
its
passable
theres
no
reasonable
lefthanded
help
and
the
middle
relief
is
iffy
tom
edens
was
expected
to
take
over
the
joe
boever
setup
man
role
but
hes
been
injured
and
he
was
an
expansion
team
acquisition
anyway
houston
thought
that
boever
would
demand
too
much
money
so
they
let
him
go
doug
jones
can
lose
his
touch
he
went
from
clevelands
allstar
closer
to
the
minors
in
a
pretty
short
span
from
what
i
understand
boever
and
murphy
were
considered
expendable
by
the
club
houston
felt
that
their
positions
could
be
filled
by
a
number
of
players
art
doug
jones
is
the
key
to
houstons
success
he
must
have
another
great
year
for
houston
to
challenge
in
the
nl
west
lousey
spring
closer
to
the
minors
in
a
pretty
short
span
right
a
strong
rotation
will
take
the
pressure
off
of
the
troubling
bullpen
bit
of
shakiness
at
the
fifth
starter
slot
but
thats
basically
normal
taubensee
anthony
gonzalez
and
cedeno
fulfilling
some
hitting
potential
anthony
appears
to
be
about
there
taubensees
swing
looks
a
lot
better
this
year
solid
knock
against
expos
last
night
gonzalez
is
showing
some
early
power
and
cedeno
still
has
the
loopiest
swing
this
side
of
tim
wallach
the
unsuspected
strength
of
the
lower
part
of
the
order
has
saved
the
club
so
far
biggio
and
finley
just
arent
doing
their
job
of
getting
on
base
instead
of
filling
his
role
as
an
rbi
man
bagwell
has
had
to
assume
biggio
and
finleys
job
biggio
concerns
me
since
he
usually
starts
the
season
very
strong
on
a
side
note
are
you
at
all
concerned
with
the
rumors
concerning
next
years
uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
traditional
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniforms
may
totally
eliminate
the
color
orange
shiver
mclanes
favorite
color
is
red
so
im
really
upset
the
current
unforms
are
dull
and
the
new
ones
sound
horrible
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretty
but
houston
had
established
a
long
precident
of
wearing
the
ugliest
uniforms
in
baseball
and
i
liked
it
end
of
the
bargain
remember
two
years
ago
a
little
relief
goes
a
long
way
then
they
could
win
games

joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
hes
not
the
greatest
this
is
true
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
i
saw
it
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
lankford
was
hurt
although
the
announcer
said
he
told
torre
he
could
pinch
hit
if
they
needed
him
to
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
i
wondered
the
same
thing
but
giving
joe
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
id
say
he
was
thinking
that
lankford
is
hurt
enough
that
he
didnt
trust
his
ability
to
bat
effectively
but
he
wants
his
speed
on
the
bases
so
pinch
run
him
alicea
i
was
completely
confused
about
maybe
he
had
a
good
record
hitting
against
that
particular
pitcher
i
dont
know
anybody
got
an
idea
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
well
so
far
i
havent
seen
much
to
say
whiten
shouldnt
be
playing
but
it
is
too
bad
that
gilkey
is
the
odd
man
out
when
they
play
jordan
ahead
of
him
that
i
dont
quite
understand
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
yup
i
looked
for
this
on
the
replay
too
if
im
joe
torre
im
going
to
have
a
talk
with
bucky
after
the
game
on
that
one
hes
got
lankford
at
third
with
todd
zeile
i
believe
a
hot
hitter
coming
up
theres
no
reason
to
risk
giving
lankford
the
go
sign
in
that
situation
unless
he
was
sure
the
ball
is
going
to
the
stands
its
his
job
to
watch
the
play
develop
he
should
have
known
larkin
was
there
to
back
up
a
bad
throw
that
seemed
inexcusable
in
my
book
btw
i
saw
dent
do
the
same
thing
last
year
with
zeile
rounding
third
and
going
into
a
sure
out
at
home
in
a
critical
situation
on
the
replay
theres
dent
waving
him
around
it
looks
like
this
might
be
a
serious
problem
the
cards
werent
good
base
runners
at
all
last
year
and
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
fault
lies
in
the

he

he
puts

uses
luis

a

with
no
power

what
the

is
he
thinking
see
above
earlier
in

in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten

that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey

torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last

what
does
he
have

do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in

at
the

torre
also
said
lankford
is
the
one
outfield
guy
whos
in
there
no
matter
what
my
guess
is
jordan
will
eventually
end
up
being
odd
man
out
due
to
low
on
base
percentage
whiten
was
a
great
acquisition
decent
offense
and
great
defense
in
rightfield
but
dont
worry
gilkey
will
be
starting
as
soon
as
jordan

whiten

extended

so
far
oneill
is
turning
out
just
fine
he
looks
like
he
should
be
able
to
duplicate
if
not
surpass
mel
halls
numbers
from
last
year
and
he
keeps
opposing
pitchers
from
pitching
around
tartabull
now
if
only
buck
would
play
him
against
lefties
some
more
to
see
what
he
can
do
a
friend
made
a
comparison
between
wickman
and
jack
morris
they
never
have
impressive
stats
but
they
always
find
some
way
to
win
although
morris
seems
to
be
losing
that
ability
i
figured
that
wickman
would
be
the
least
important
part
of
the
steve
sax
trade
best
trade
since
we
got
that
ruth
guy
maybe
winding
up
as
a
good
middle
reliever
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretty
but
he
gets
the
job
done
whats
going
on
here
key
was
just
supposed
to
provide
the
rotation
with
some
stability
you
know
shore
up
the
left
side
provide
experience
get
maybe
wins
and
here
this
guy
is
dominating
everybody
he
faces
who
needs
maddux
or
cone
ill
take
key
any
day
and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surprises
owen
sure
hes
hitting
like
crazy
but
the
guy
cannot
field
to
save
his
life
and
they
said
he
was
brought
in
to
provide
defense
velarde
stankiewicz
and
even
silvestri
are
better
defensively
than
owen
remember
its
still
early
look
for
his
offense
to
tail
off
and
his
defense
to
improve
hopefully
he
has
that
rep
because
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
years
or
something
like
that
he
has
the
third
highest
fielding
percentage
among
major
league
shortstops
behind
cr
and
tony
im
not
gonna
help
this
sorry
mets
team
at
all
fernandez
i
do
agree
though
that
he
has
not
looked
all
that
impressive
in
the
field
thus
far
the
book
on
tartabull
was
keep
him
healthy
and
hell
produce
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
hes
hit
a
few
homers
but
those
were
all
solo
shots
and
he
hasnt
gotten
any
of
the
big
rbis
that
your
cleanup
man
is
supposed
to
give
you
then
again
he
had
a
slow
start
last
year
once
he
got
off
the
dl
that
is
and
turned
into
a
oneman
wrecking
crew
late
in
the
year
so
well
see
bullpen
ughwhat
happened
we
were
supposed
to
have
one
of
the
most
solid
pens
in
the
majors
meanwhile
the
pen
has
already
blown
three
saves
maybe
more

it

theyll
get

is
defense
not
just
as
important
frankly
no
offense
and
defense
are
equally
important
but
the
pitcher
is
of
the
defense
the
primary
role
of
every
other
player
is
on
offense
even
shortstops
are
a
bigger
part
of
the
offensive
game
than
of
the
defensive
game
they
might
not
do
much
with
their

of
the

thats

well
sherri
id
agree
with
you
except
that
most
kiddies
have
more
sense
than
to
spew
their
obscenities
in

of
a
group
of

i
try
to
edit
this
newsgroup
and
feed
it
to
one
of
the
local
elementary

they
have
a
group
of
students
that
just
love
baseball
and
are
learning
to
use
computers
but
im
telling
you
its
gotten
to
the
point
that
i
dont
even
edit
the

anymore
just
read
them
and
throw
out
the
trash
and
thanks
to
all
you
people
that
think
its
wonderful
to
include
a
swear
word
or
two
in
your
signature
files
thats
really
nice
i
have
to
read
the

then
toss
it
out
because
of
the

dont
get

wrong
i
know

you
do

ive
even
made

i
wouldnt
be
able

this
just
doesnt
seem

be

to
spew
foul

sorry
thanks
to
all
you
people
that
keep
in

there
might
be

do

read

i
do
know
that
he
has
been
accused
before
as
being
an

that
enjoys
hopefully
for

drumb

i
almost
totally
blame
bonilla
no

what
a

does
and
no

how
much
of
a
putrid

he
might
be
that
does
not
give

the

always
thought

should
report

not

which
wouldnt

unreasonable
and
even
if
you
dont
let

theyll
score
a

more
than
the

by
going

more
often
no

gordon
i
wouldnt
give
baserunning
that
much
value
the
above
effect
is
clear
but
there
are
other
effects
as
well
if
olerud
hits
a
double
any
runner
on
first
will
score
if
alomar
legs
an
extra
base
onto
a
hit
in
the
gap
the
runner
on
first
may
need
to
hold
at
third
thus
oleruds
doubles
have
more
advancement
value
than
alomars
of
course
alomar
is
more
likely
to
score
after
hitting
a
double
another
reason
not
to
give
too
much
extra
value
to
baserunning
is
that
the
runs
created
formulas
work
for
very
fast
and
very
slow
teams
no
team
in
the
ran
much
but
some
teams
certainly
had
faster
players
than
others
still
the
current
runs
created
formulas
work
just
as
well
in
the
for
all
teams
bill
james
gives
the
senators
as
an
example
they
used
harmon
killebrew
regularly
as
a
pinch
runner
and
in
stole
bases
with
times
caught
stealing
yet
they
scored
slightly
more
runs
than
predicted
by

this

called
stolen

defined

a
play
made
that
an

fielder
would
not
make
with

effort
using

posted

some

hits
stolen
have
been

plays
kurt

ok
i

thats
unfair
kurts
probably
the
victim
of
pitching
staff
fluke
shots
and
a

park
factor
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
we
replaced
every
second
baseman
in
the
nl
with
someone
with
kurts
out
making
ability
how
many
extra
hits
would
go
by
to
try
and
correlate
it
to
reality
a
little
more
ive
calculated
net
hits
stolen
based
on
the
number
of
outs
made
compared
to
what
a
league
average
fielder
would
make
by
the
same
method
ive
calculated
net
double
plays
and
net
extra
bases
doubles
and
triples
let
by
finally
i
throw
all
this
into
a
a
formula
i
call
defensive
contribution
or
dcon
basically
it
represents
the
defensive
contribution
of
a
player
i
add
this
number
to
ops
to
get
dops
defense
onbase
plus
slug
which
should
represent

total

well
officially
its
the

at

up

they
started
winning
it
was
are
they
still
officially
if
so
why
and
how
did
they
receive
this
label
unoffically
but
without
a
doubt
americas
team
is
the
cubs
why
well
my
guess
is
because
america
loves
underdogs
every
year
no
matter
the
cubs
talent
or
the
predictions
they
never
as
close
to
never
as
possible
win
anything
over
the
years
as
the
losing
has
mounted
america
has
fallen
in
love
with
these
perennial
losers
the
cubs
have
more
fans
in
chicago
then
some
teams
do
worldwide
the
cubs
have
more
fans
worldwide
than
most
of
the
teams
in
their
division
combined
an
aura
of
excitement
surrounds
the
cubs
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
like
no
one
else
including
the
ws
champs
it
must
be
that
eternal
hope
this
is
the
year
theyve
got
the
talent
theyre
off
to
a
good
start
theyve
got
the
pitching
or
hitting
or
whatever
their
strong
point
is
at
the
time
its
that
inevitability
that
the
cubs
will
eventually
win
the
ws
again
when
only
god
knows
since
its
been
so
long
it
could
come
at
any
time
or
it
could
be
another
years
but
until
they
do
finally
win
and
start
winning

lucky

get

but
he
had
an
era
of
with
a
team
that
scored
a
lot
of

i
would
be
happy
if
he
could
still

but
he
seems
to
be
suffering
from
a
total
callapse
bad
pitchers
are
more
prone
to
this
total
collapse
than
good
pitchers
they
are
closer
to
the
chasm
of
mediocrity
the
smallest
push
and
they
completely
lose
their
grip
but
good
ones
can
collapse
somewhat

come

burleigh
grimes
went
from

an

so
in

and
an

around

more

lost

after
his
record
source
bill
james
historical
baseball
abstract
and
lets
not
forget
john
tudor
who
started
and
finished
in
he
had
a
pretty
bad
era
when
you
take
busch
stadium
into
account
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
gave
up
early
runs
in
his
games
and
would
get
stronger
as
the
game
went
on
thus
giving
up
few
runs
in
the
last
going
he
stays
in
the
game
and
gets
the
win
how
else
would
he
have
pitched
so
many
innings
yup
he
used
to
dig
himself
a
hole
then
get
it
together
and
stick
in
until
the
run
support
eventually
came
through
this
year
he
just
hasnt
gotten
it
together
if
i
recall
he
had
a
era
in
the
half
and
a
era
in
the
half
of
last
year
hmmm
runs
in
innings
suppose
he
starts
more
games
and
winds
up
innings
pitched
if
he
allows
runs
a
game
in
the
next
innings
hell
have
a
era
or
so
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
think
i
have
his
totals
right
this
is
going
to
be
hard
to
come
back
from
jack
may
be
finished
it
is
time
to
retire
or
be
released
if
he
does
not
return
to
his
form
from
last
year
his
million
contract
is
an
awful
lot
to
eat
my
hunch
is
that
morris
is
very
gutsy
and
that
he
may
be
pitching
through
an
injury
and
not
telling
anyone
my
guess
is
that
he
will
be
banished
to
the
bullpen
the
remainder
of
the
season
after
a
few
more
starts
perhaps
when

been

time
but
being
absent
from

for

i
figured
id
stick

the

will
set
the

scored

an

since

ps
any
ideas
what
this
is
they
will
fall
easily
short
of
runs
thats
for
damn
sure
i
cant
believe
these
media
fools
picking
them
to
win
the
division
like
our
tom
gage
of
the
detroit
news
claiming
herk
robinson
is
some
kind
of
genius
for
the
tradesaquisitions
hes
made
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
dodgers
in
or
true
cone
is
probably
as
good
as
drysdale
and
they
have
no
koufax
but
still
these
teams
were
winning
with
home
run
leaders
who
had
very
bad
totals
with
lots
of
lowscoring
games
etc
and
they
didnt
use
relievers
whereas
jeff
montgomery
is
having
a
super
season
for
them
that
being
said
i
still
picked
them
or
so
but
i
think
a
superb
pitching
team
can
win
if
they
have
enough
hitting
theres
more
of
a
chance
of
that
i
think
than
of
a
team
with
tremendous
hitting
but
no
pitching
at
least
to
me
i
wonder
though
which
one
do
you
people
think
would
do
better
a
team
with
johnson
koufax
in
his
prime
seaver
carlton
and
young
in
no
real
order
as
the
starters
with
sutter
fingers
and
lyle
in
the
bullpen
but
with
a
puny
offense
assuming
good
defense
like
mazeroski
maranville
etc
or
a
team
with
poor
pitching
but
with
an
offense
of
cobb
carew
ruth
gehrig
mays
schmidt
wagner
and
bench
againyou
pick
the
order
i
would
postulate
that
the
pitching
one
would
be
several
games
better
by
seasons
end
even
the
best
hitters
can
succeed
only
of
the
time
in
their
best
years
but
a
great
pitcher
can
throw
lots
of
shutouts
taking
all
the
players
in
their
prime
they
might
throw
shutouts
in
a
year
and
all
the
offense
would
have
to
do
is
get
run
across
i
wonder
if
someone
with
stratomatic
or
something
could
plug
such
all

teams

have

johnny

hit

i
am
almost

rather
have
zane
smith
pitch
right
handed
than
have
moeller
pitch
at
all
i
am
sure
simmons
was
ready
to
say
i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impressive
win
last
week
now
ottos
latest
debacle
has
restored
simmons
reputation
now
he
looks
like
he
is
back
in
his
form
when
he
had
the
als
highest
era
among
starters
four
our
sakenot
teds
sake
i
hope
he
pitches
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
tomlin
and
merced
are
a
bit
disappointing
they
are
still
doing
decently
but
considering
the
considerable
amount
of
talent
and
maturity
they
have
shown
their
first
seasons
they
seem
to
have
actually
gotten
a
little
bit
worse
tomlin
was
almost
unhittable
his
rookie
year
against
lefty
batters
merced
had
a
very
good
oba
his
rookie
year
he
showed
a
lot
of
concentration
at
the
plate
in
his
rookie
year
walk
well
he
seems
to
be
on
the
losing
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrved
his
contract
leyland
should
accept
a
part
of
the
blame
for
the
lavalliere
situation
i
cant
understand
his
and
managements
fear
of
losing
tom
prince
through
waivers
even
if
they
do
whats
the
use
he
is
aright
hander
like
slaught
not
a
very
smart
platoon
also
i
am
blaming
leyland
in
this
case
since
he
is
hcurrently
convinced
that
lavalliere
is
through
while
giving
him
way
too
much
time
last
year
in
the
regular
season
and
the
playoffsslaught
should
have
played
in
all
games
he
has
a
good
average
against
right
handed
pitching
didnt
leyland
and
simmons
forsee
this
last
year
and
attempt
to
trade
lavalliere
last
year
itself
any
fool
could
tell
them
lavalliere
wasnt
very
fit
last
year
dennis
moeller
is
scary
candeleria
well
he
is
not
going
to
have
such
a
high
era
at
the
end
of
the
season
maybe
it
will
be
in
range
but
million
plus
come
on
other
than
the
customary
home
run
giving
stage
patterson
goes
through
for
a
few
weeks
patterson
has
served
the
pirates
very
well
each
year
so
far
he
seems
to
have
pitched
well
for
the
rangers
i
think
the
pirates
should
have
spent
the
money
on
patterson
in
stead
the
rookie
batters
well
young
has
surprised
me
a
bit
with
his
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excellent
performance
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surprise
i
think
we
should
thank
doughty
for
that
rookie
pitchers
worse
than
expected
especially
cooke
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extension
last
year
now
his
value
has
increased
immensely
lonnie
smith
well
eric
davis
was
signed
for
a
comparable
amount
lets
see
eric
can
hit
better
he
can
run
better
he
can
field
better
now
why
didnt
the
pirates
go
after
eric
davis
an
injured
davis
is
better
than
a
healthy
lonnie
smith
even
if
lonnnie
smith
gets
some
big
hits
this
yearhe
wont
be
an
asset
he
has
looked
terrible
on
the
bases
and
in
the
field
management
big
big
zero
sauer
has
yet
to
make
a
forceful
agreement
in
favor
of
revenue
sharing
he
seems
more
concerned
about
pleasing
that
idiot
danforth
by
preparing
the
team
for
a
move
to
tampa
bay
alex
cole
fiasco
the
pirates
infield
and
cf
positions
look
good
the
rf
and
lf
would
have
looked
good
if
we
could
have
gotten
cole
to
replace
two
of
the
four
outfielders
eric
davis
van
slyke
and
cole
would
have
made
a
very
respectable
outfield
even
without
eric
davis
thye
pirates
would
have
a
respectable
outfield
with
cole
svan
slyke
and
mercedi
think
he
should
hit
left
handed
against
lefts
in
stead
of
switch
hitting
simmons
did
have
options
for
the
outfield
ironically
the
biggest
accomplishment
of
simmons
tenure
was
getting
alex
cole
really
cheap
too
bad
compensatory
draft
picks
for
bonds
forget
it
the
pirates
can
rant
and
rave
they
will
not
get
those
picks
as
of
now
the
issue
is
still
being
appealed
now
if
this
doesnt
convince
anyone
that
simmons
and
sauer
are
idiots
nothing
else
will
on
a
final
note
tim
wakefield
wont
be
as
awful
as
he
was
in
his
last
starts
but
dont
count
on
him
pitching
like
last
year
for
the
rest
of
the
season
also
if
the
pirates
are
in
contention
towards
rthe
end
of
the

they
will
miss

i

oooooo
cheap
shot
damn
morris
now
has

probably
the

in

who
cares
he
had
two
of
them
before
he
came

if
the

had

viola
instead
of

it
would
have
been
frank
who
won
and
got
the
ring
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
this

too
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
your
logic
is
curious
and
spurious
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
viola
wouldnt
have
won
as
many
games
had
he
signed
with
toronto
when
you
compare
their
stupid
wl
records
be
sure
to
compare
their
teams
offensive
averages
too
now
looking
at
anything
like
the
morrisviola
sweepstakes
a
year
later
is
basically
hindsight
but
there
were
plenty
of
reasons
why
it
should
have
been
apparent
that
viola
was
the
better
pitcher
based
on
previous
recent
years
and
also
based
on
age
frank
is
almost
years
younger
how
many
knew
that
people
got
caught
up
in
the
world
series
and
then
on
morris
wins
last
year
wins
are
the
stupidest
most
misleading
statistic
in
baseball
far
worse
than
rbi
or
r
that
he
won
just
means
that
the
jays
got
him
a
lot
of
runs
the
only
really
valid
retort
to
valentine
is
werent
the
red
sox
trying
to
get
morris
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
was
their
first
choice
afterwards
but
what
should
we
have
expected
they
would
say
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in

more
like
if
this
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack

contribution

who
was

c
lavallieres
release
had
nothing
to

with

being

was
released
because
in
the
event
of
an
injury
to
slaught
lavalliere
is
no

capable
they
believe
of
being
the

catcher

slaught

i
agree

why

face
more
righthanded

lefthanded
batters
i

why

insist

lefthanded
starters
unless
there
is
a
park
effect
eg
yankee
stadium
most
batters
in
mlb
are
righthanded
so
righthanded
starters
will
have
the
platoon
advantage
more
often
than
lefthanded
starters
i
guess
one
argument
for
lefty
starters
is
that
certain
teams
may
be
more
vulnerable
to
lhps
than
rhps
however
this
is
probably
only
a
factor
in
the
postseason
because
teams
seldom
juggle
their
starters
for
this
reason
during
the
regular
season
i
think
you
just
want
the
best
starters
you
can
get
regardless
of
whether
they
are
lefties
or
righties
lefthanded
starters
tend
to
have
higher
eras
than
righthanded
starters
precisely
because
managers
go
out

their

it

who
cares
i
dont

why
people
expect
boston

sixth
the
bottom
four
teams
last
year
were
essentially
tied
boston
in
seventh
place
had
wins
the
yankees
and
indians
tied
for
fourth
place
had
wins
now
i
should
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
red
sox
improved
more
than
the
indians
or
tigers
basically
the
red
sox
are
stronger
this
year
at
dh
ss
lf
and
rf
they
have
healthier
starting
pitchers
so
far
at
least
and
better
relievers
i
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldnt
win
games
meanwhile
the
indians
are
in
shambles
and
the
tigers
still
have
no
pitching
they
will
win
some
blowouts
but
they
will
lose
an
awful
lot
of
games
too
maybe
the
sox
will
play
poorly
win
games

finish

i

aaa
umpires
ive
never
seen
her
ump
a
game
i
have
no
first
hand
experience
with
her
ability
as
an
umpire
but
i
have
seen
her
on
talk
shows
and
her
point
seems
to
be
that
she
can
call
balls
and
strikes
as
well
as
any
of
the
umpires
and
she
knows
the
rulebook
better
than
most
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
missing
the
point
and
if
thats
how
she
sees
the
role
of
umpires
in
the
game
well
i
wouldnt
promote
her
either
the
umpires
primary
role
has
nothing
to
do
with
calling
baserunners
safe
or
out
hell
joe
lundy
could
do
that
their
primary
function
is
to
maintain
order
in
the
game
keep
the
game
moving
and
keep
the
players
from
trying
to
kill
each
other
umpires
have
to
be
extremely
tough
people
that
disqualifies
most

us
both
men
and
women
and
if
ms
postema
thinks
that
she
deserves
to
be
a
major
league
umpire
because
of
her
command
of
the
rulebook
then
i
think
that
disqualifies
her
as
well

so
far
simmons
looks
like
a
total
idiot
whatever
you
say
i
think
its
just
games
into
the
season
myself
so
im
going
to
wait
a
bit
before
calling
names
i
am
sure
simmons
was
ready
to
say
i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impressive
win
last
week
now
ottos
latest
debacle
has
restored
simmons
reputation
now
he
looks
like
he
is
back
in
his
form
when
he
had
the
als
highest
era
among
starters
four
our
sakenot
teds
sake
i
hope
he
pitches
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
i
expect
that
dave
otto
will
be
a
really
bad
pitcher
and
i
have
no
idea
why
simmons
ever
wanted
him
on
the
other
hand
i
expect
him
to
release
otto
if
he
doesnt
turn
things
around
pretty
fast
btw
ottos
game
score
for
that
ip
stinker
was
only
which
points
out
a
problem
with
the
method
since
ottos
performance
was
infinitely
bad
and
excruciatingly
prolonged
tomlin
and
merced
are
a
bit
disappointing
they
are
still
doing
decently
but
considering
the
considerable
amount
of
talent
and
maturity
they
have
shown
their
first
seasons
they
seem
to
have
actually
gotten
a
little
bit
worse
i
think
merceds
rookie
year
was
a
bit
flukey
but
arent
you
willing
to
give
him
some
more
at
bats
and
tomlin
a
few
more
starts
before
acting
so
gloomy
walk
well
he
seems
to
be
on
the
losing
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrved
his
contract
no
he
didnt
walk
is
a
time
bomb
he
has
no
stuff
whatsoever
and
when
the
league
finally
realizes
this
it
wont
be
pretty
at
all
the
rookie
batters
well
young
has
surprised
me
a
bit
with
his
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excellent
performance
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surprise
i
think
we
should
thank
doughty
for
that
dont
be
so
fast
doughty
is
the
guy
who
signed
steve
buechele
which
was
a
move
that
threatened
to
bury
kevin
young
in
the
minors
meanwhile
im
not
sure
whether
doughty
or
simmons
signed
martin
as
a
sixyear
free
agent
before
the
season
rookie
pitchers
worse
than
expected
especially
cooke
twice
through
the
rotation
and
youve
given
up
yikes
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extension
last
year
now
his
value
has
increased
immensely
but
so
has
his
age
at
least
in
baseball
terms
the
useful
halflife
of
a
yearold
injuryprone
catcher
cant
be
much
longer
than
a
year
lonnie
smith
well
eric
davis
was
signed
for
a
comparable
amount
but
he
wanted
to
be
a
dodger
and
felt
he
had
something
to
prove
after
his
disastrous
i
dont
think
there
was
any
chance
for
the
bucs
to
sign
him
lets
see
eric
can
hit
better
he
can
run
better
he
can
field
better
now
why
didnt
the
pirates
go
after
eric
davis
an
injured
davis
is
better
than
a
healthy
lonnie
smith
he
certainly
wasnt
last
year
even
if
lonnnie
smith
gets
some
big
hits
this
yearhe
wont
be
an
asset
he
has
looked
terrible
on
the
bases
and
in
the
field
hey
thats
the
skates
smith
package
deal
anybody
who
acquires
lonnie
for
his
defense
or
baserunning
particularly
at
this
stage
is
a
real
weirdo
management
big
big
zero
sauer
has
yet
to
make

in

he
seems

idiot
danforth
by
preparing
the
team
for
a
move
to
tampa
bay
if
thats
the
goal
of
the

ownership
than
i
dont
see
why
sauer
gets
a
zero
for
making
his

happy
i
dont
know
what
he
has
or
hasnt
said
about

sharing
so
i
cant
comment
there
alex
cole
fiasco
stuff
deleted
ironically
the
biggest
accomplishment
of
simmons
tenure
was
getting
alex
cole
really
cheap
too
bad
that
he
gave
him
away
in
the
expansion
draft
its
annoying
but
since
leyland
seems
to
have
been
pushing
for
them
to
retain
jeff
king
it
was
probably
unavoidable
meanwhile
i
think
bigger
accomplishments
of
simmons
tenure
were
getting
some
value
for
john
smiley
not
trading
real
prospects
for
veterans
down
the
stretch
last
year
drafting
well
in
letting
the
rookies
show
something
in
foley
smith
and
candelaria
were
acquired
to
be
replacement
parts
which
means
that
even
if
fail
it
hasnt
done
serious
damage
to
the
bucs
future
compensatory
draft
picks
for
bonds
forget
it
the
pirates
can
rant
and
rave
they
will
not
get
those
picks
as
of
now
the
issue
is
still
being
appealed
does
this
mean
that
the
bucs
lost
the
initial
arbitration
case
i
never
heard
the
outcome
of
this
when
will
the
final
verdict
be
in
on
this
now
if
this
doesnt
convince
anyone
that
simmons
and
sauer
are
idiots
nothing
else
will
im
not
sure
who
was
the
idiot
in
this
case
so
i
dont
know
who
to
blame
it
might
have
been
doug
danforth
after
all
in
fact
i
seriously
suspect
it
was
doug
danforth

has
shown
his

call

exactly

jking
subject
re
dodger
question
the
dodgers
have
been
shopping
harris
to
other
teams
in
their
quest
for
more
lefthanded
pitching
so
far
no
takers
personally
i
think
harris
is
a
defensive
liability
and
he
has
also
led
the
team
in
past
years
for
hitting
into
double
plays
or
at
least
been
among
the
leaders
sharperson
showed
last
year
that
if
given
a
chance
to
play
every
day
he
can
get
the
job
done
if
sharpy
played
just
one
base
every
day
say
third
hed
also
improve
defensively
wallach
has
helped
tremendously
on
defense
as
has
reed
the
improved
defense
is
quite
noticeable
and
is
having
an
effect
on
the
pitching
staff
both
astacio
and
martinez
were
bailed
out
in
recent
starts
by
great
defensive
plays
martinez
pitched
into
the
ninth
in
a
game
that
might
have
seen
him
lifted
in
the
third
in
past
years
astacio
lasted
innings
the
other
day
under
similar
circumstances
the
dodgers
are
turning
double
plays
and
keeping
more
balls
in
the
infield
than
last
year
and
piazza
has
also
been
great
on
defense
he
has
thrown
out
of
batters
trying
to
steal
and
has
at
least
one
pick
off
at
first
wallach
clearly
has
contributed
to
the
over
all
improvement
on
defense
but
his
offense
is
awful
and
he
has
cost
the
dodgers
some
runs
but
i
dont
think
he
is
as
bad
as
his
current
average
i
suspect
he
will
come
out
of
this
slump
much
as
davis

straw

have

his
injury
consistently
hit
at
or
near
while
knocking
in
home
runs
have
you
even
looked
at
dave
winfields
slugging
percentage
for
three
or
of
his
best
seasons
i
still
think
that
dave
was
one
of
the
better
of
all
time
but
obviously
not
the
best
he
was
one
of
the
best
athletes
evr
to
play
baseball
he
hit
line
drives
that
hit
the
scoreboard
in
leftcenter
field
a
feat
np
one
has
done
in
the
new
stadium
heck
only
or
other
people
have
hit
it
over
that
green
fence
since
it
has
been
remodeled
he
could
field
had
a
bullet
arm
and
his
hitting
was
comparable
in
many
seasons
to
gary
sheffields
and
barry
bonds
of
last
season
he
is
older
now
and
slowing
down
takes
more
of
an
uppercut
to
lift
the
ball
out
of
the
park
but
he
will
always
be
my
hero
and
my
idol
there
is
nothing
that
could
make
me
happier
than
george
inviting
dave
back
to
the
bronx
to
play
his
last
year
of
ball
with
the
yankees
of
course
he
will
most
likely
refuse
the
offer
but
who
knows
for
million
dollars
hell
play
heck
they
are
giving
gallego
million
this
year
having
dave
as
their
dh
while
leaving
him
time
to
play
the
field
when
tartabull
is
injured
or
nokes
and
mass
are
traded
should
give
the
yanks
the
inspiration
and
leadership
that
will
sweep
in
a
new

a

made
a

never
have
impressive

they
always
find
some
way
to
win
although
morris
seems
to
be
losing
that

i
figured
that
wickman
would
be
the

important

the

best
trade
since
we
got
that
ruth
guy
maybe
winding
up
as
a
good
middle
reliever
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretty

he
gets
the
job
done
actually
i
kind

liked

hi

so
what

dont
you

i

heck
if
dave

hohum
is
seriously
being
considered
for
it
as
is
lee
smith
ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chance
or
darrell
evans
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall

takes
in

it
can
take
in
eddie
murray
and
jeff
reardon
oh
yeah
dave
winfieldmarginal
player
guy
didnt
hit
a
lick
had
negligible
power
was
a
crap
fielder
and
had
no
staying
power
dave
winfield
now
entering
his
i
believe
big
league
season
is
still
a
damn
decent
hitter
admittedly
his
defense
has
slipped
a
great
deal
but
in
his
prime
he
had
a
powerful
arm
and
great
range
take
a
look
at
the
stats
i
dont
know
where
you
even
begin
to
make
an
argument
that
winfield
and
kingman
are
similar
players
kingman
was
a
onedimension
power
hitterhe
couldnt
field
he
ran
like
an
anvil
hit
for
a
low
average
though
if
i
remember
right
his
obp
wasnt
that
hideous
and
for
those
who
consider
such
things
important
was
a
absoluteprimodick
eddie
murray
yup
only
the
best
baseman
of
the
i
know
that
mvp
votes
are
conducted
by
mediots
but
given
that
he
got
jobbed
out
of
the
mvp
he
deserved
in
it
seems
that
he
wasnt
overrated
by
the
media
lee
smith
hmmmm
this
ones
actually
pretty
close
hes
had
a
s
solid
dependable
career
as
a
closer
despite
pitching
in
some
nasty
parks
wrigley
fenway
id
have
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
stats
its
been
a
while
but
it
seems
lee
arthur
is
of
hof
caliber
you
do
make
a
legitimate
point
about
the
hof
credentials
of
relievers
simply
racking
up
a
lot
of
saves
doesnt
mean
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
if
you
blow
a
bunch
too
simply
because
minnesota
and
boston
and
for
a
month
atlanta
used
reardon
as
a
closer
for
longer
than
he
should
have
been
one
the
equalizer
has
racked
up
an
impressive
number
of
saves
no
way
should
homerman
be
in
the
hof
imho
darrell
evans
nice
career
actually
a
bit
underrated
kinda
like
ted
simmons
imho
but
not
a
hofer
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall
of
fame
consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
lemme
ask
you
this
who
the
hell
playing
the
game
isnt
marginal
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
something
now
wait
a
goddamn
minute
here
ozzie
smith
absolutely
redefined
the
position
of
shortstop
his
defense
was
so
good
that
hes
won
something
along
the
lines
of
gold
gloves
again
gold
gloves
are
mediotbiased
and
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
larkin
deserved
one
or
two
of
ozzies
more
recent
awards
but
usually
this
is
tempered
by
someone
else
in
the
early
getting
the
gold
gloves
ozzie
deserved
earlier
in
his
career
ozzies
offense
you
ask
good
obp
great
speed
numbers
in
a
park
which
for
most
of
his
career
depressed
offense
admittedly
no
power
cept
against
tom
niedenfuer
but
still
a
definite
asset
offensively
yount
hits
mvp
at
two
different
positions
uhhuh
a
real
stiff
his
was
one
of
the
great
years
ever
by
a
player
in
recent
memory
and
probably
ranks
behind
only
the
peak
seasons
of
wagner
and
banks
as
far
as
ss
numbers
go
hes
a
clear
hofer
imho
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
well
as
far
as
garvey
goes
youre
right
garvey
is
a
mediot
candidate
pushed
because
of
his
winning
attitude
a
minor
factor
if
one
at
all
and
his
great
defense
no
errors
admittedly
but
the
range
of
a
tree
stump
garvey
shouldnt
be
in
the
hof
skyjack
ive
said
a
lot
of
nasty
things
about
skyjack
in
the
last
year
or
so
but
this
is
mostly
in
response
to
mediots
and
woofers
who
talk
about
morris
ability
to
win
which
is
nothing
more
than
morris
ability
to
pitch
when
toronto
to
score
tons
of
runs
at
this
point
morris
is
an
average
pitcher
although
from
his
early
returns
in
he
may
be
damned
close
to
done
but
in
all
fairness
morris
was
a
dominant
pitcher
in
the
for
upanddown
tiger
teams
while
was
obviously
a
great
year
for
detroit
the
rest
of
the
decade
the
team
was
generally
in
contention
but
not
favorites
morris
career
numbers
are
quite
good
and
worthy
of
hof
consideration
ryan
of
course
but
be
careful
i
guarantee
you
that
someone
will
throw
back
your
earlier
logic
about
yount
and
smith
being
shortstops
who
hung
around
a
long
time
after
all
nolan
never
won
a
cy
damn
hes
just
pitcher
who
hung
around
for
years
his
wl
record
is
mediocre
of
course
nolans
a
hofer
puck
probably
although
hes
got
to
play
reasonably
well
for
a
few
more
years
years
even
good
ones
arent
enough
to
make
the
hof
most
likely
that
said
i
believe
puckett
will
make
the
hof
pretty
much
regardless
of
how
the
rest
of
his
career
turns
out
barring
something
really
tragic
or
sudden
hes
very
popular
in
the
media
and
with
fans
and
legitimately
has
been
one
of
the
best
cfs
in
the
game
since
he
joined
the
league
ive
always
liked
the
guy
and
i
hope
he
does
make
it
and
in
the
end
i
think
the
puck
will
make
it
in
but
really
its
too
early
to
sell
this
debate
comes
up
rather
frequently
on
the
net
and
believe
it
or
not
i
never
tire

my
question
to
you
all
is
why
does
the
media
seem
to
embrace
the
theme
of
the
death
of
baseball
so
strongly
i
have
seen
articles
of
a
similar
vein
in
the
chicago
tribune
and
in
sports
editorials
on
tv
maybe
because
baseball
is
the
only
business
where
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
fiscal
aspects
of
the
game
preach
gloom
and
doom
these
allegedly
intelligent
people
seem
to
predict
bad
times
losing
money
bankruptcies
at
an
alarming
rate
and
theres
going
to
be
an
increased
degradation
of
the
product
they
produce
could
you
imagine
ibm
with
all
their
problems
promoting
themselves
the
way
major
league
baseball
does
their
stock
would
plummet
to
unthinkable
depths
not
that
they
are
too
far
from
it
now
what
would
happen
at
gm
where
would
gm
be
if
they
admitted
to
cutting
corners
and
producing
an
inferior
product
because
of
alleged
labor
problems
i
think
it
shows
a
lack
of
confidence
for
the
people
who
run
the
game
anyway
it
just
frustrates
me
when
the
media
says
such
things
because
it
inevitably
leads
to
owners
trying
quick
fixes
like
increasing
playoffs
to
satisfy
television
or
trying
interleague
play
to
drum
up
interest
forget
it
word
has
it

is
just
about

any

fan
who
can
actually
muster
up
the
courage
to
put
down
braves

i
mean
all
the
braves
have
done
is
gone
to
two
consecutive

also
being

really

out
there
that
are
capable
of
driving
me
crazy
with
that
infernal
cheer
that
they
have
however
i
do
have
to
protest
anyone
saying
that
all
cubs
fans
are
stupid
the
way
i
see
it
either
im
just
too
stupid
to
acknowledge
it
or
that
observation
was
just
plain
wrong
you
might
have
us
confused
with
bear
fans
anyway
about
a
two
weeks
ago
just
about
everyone
was
saying
that
the
cubs
would
finish
up
last
in
their
division
even
behind
florida
sheesh
these
same
people
were
predicting
the
braves
to
clean
up
in
their
respective
division
well
were
ten
games
into
the
season
and
these
people
are
a
little
less
vocal
now
i
wonder
why
well
the
way
i
see
it
the
east
is
up
for
grabs
and
whoever
wants
it
most
is
going
to
take
it
with
the
exception
of
florida
every
team
seems
to
have
good
batting
and
pitching
with
philly
presently
leading
the
pack
but
i
just
have
to
point
out
if
the
cubs
do
take
the
east
theyll
do
it
without
the
benefit
of
a
competent
manager
however
and
it
pains
me
to
say
it
the
pennant
is
going
to
go

jose
cansecos
swing
vs
was
going
over
some
videos
last
night
studying
and
videotapes
of
jose
canseco
proved
to
be
very
interesting
and
enlightening
heres
my
analysis
of
jose
canseco
circa
sep
and
jose
canseco
circa
june
hes
bulked
up
too
much
period
he
needs
to
lose
about
pounds
not
gain
more
bulk
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
what
would
i
do
if
i
were
jose
aside
from
salting
away
a
large
sum
of
a
cash
that
i
could
never
touch
so
that
id
never
have
to
work
again
id
restructure
my
entire
swing
first
minimize
movement
before
the
swing
close
and
widen
the
stance
and
severely
cut
down
the
stride
i
take
on
my
swing
hopefully
this
will
cut
down
on
the
time
i
need
to
swing
and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freely
second
drop
pounds
cut
out
the
weight
work
third
relax
the
wrists
will
cost
some
power
but
until
i
can
find
my
stroke
concentrate
on
keeping
the
back
shoulder
up
rolling
the
wrists
through
the
strike
zone
and
hit
line
drives
his
strength
is
more
than
enough
so
that
some
of
those
line
drives
will
get
out
of
the
park
if
cansecos
open
stance
and
resulting
bad
habits
are
a
result
of
his
back
problems
hell
be
out
of
baseball
in
three
years
if
not
he
could
still

looking

its

doesnt
sound
bad
when
youre
averaging
three

giving

early

things
will
undoubtedly
get
better
the

should
come
around
but
the

is
a
major
worry

milwaukee
won
a

of

last

when
middle
relief
either
held
small
leads

kept
small

the

okay
the

years

i
dont
for

second
believe
jose
used

back
problems
are
very
similar
to
problems
alot
of
steroid
users
experience
because
they
are
simply
carrying
too
much
weight
on
their
framesee
jeff
bregel
ex
as
a
textbook
example
and
imho
jose
is
too
big
for
his
frame
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
i
cant
imagine
how
to
estimate
bat
speed
but
its
pretty
obvious
that
jose
is
missing
fastballs
he
used
to
hit
likely
due
to
his
back
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort

sometimes
theyre
fully

without

its
hard
to
make

in

i
dont
know
he
had
an
even
more
open
stance
when
he
first
came
up
with
the
as
and
had
no
problems
with
it
then
it
might
be
that
preback
problems
he
was
quick
enough
to
cover
up
any
deficiencies
the
stance
caused
but
now
hes
lost
just
enough
bat
speed
that
the
stance
hurts
him
the
old
saying
if
youre
hot
its
a
trigger
mechanism
if
youre
cold
its
a
hitch

minimize
movement

the

and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freely
the
biggest
problem
imho
is
he
never
has
found
a
stance
hes
comfortable
with
for
more
than
a
few
months
he
changes
his
stance
so
much
he
loses
track
of
where
the
strike
zone
is
in
wednesdays
night
game
he
was
clearly
mad
at
strike
calls
on
both
corners
that
looked
pretty
good
to
me
i
think
he
no
longer
knows
where
the
strike
zone
really
is
because
hes
changed
his
stance
so
much
im
also
a
bit
concerned
that
because
hes
got
palmer
and
gonzalez
hitting
all
the
homeruns

fan
almost
perfectly
its
a
sports
fans
dream
especially
if
that
person
is
from
ny
and
wants
to
hear
about
his
teams
while
hes
away
at
school
as
for
lupica
berman
its
turned
out
to
be
lupica
then
berman
neither
of
them
wanted
to
work
a
full
four
hour
show
so
ed
coleman
and
dave
sims
old
fourhour
slot
was
broken
down
into
two
seperate
twohour
show
lupica
from
and
berman
from

they
both
happen
to
suck
in

to
eddie

dave
come
back
guys
the
fan
is
an
okay
sports
radio
station
but
doesnt
come
close
to
the
ultimate
in
sports
radio
wip
in
philadelphia
the
signal
might
not
be
as
powerful
but
then
again
only
stations
in
new
york
feel
obligated
to
pollute
everyone
elses
airwaves
with
a
bunch
of
hoodlum
mets
fans
complaining
hours
a
day
wip
took
two
of
your
best
sports
jockeys
too
jody
macdonald
and
steve
fredericks
wip
is
rockin
with
sports
talk
from
am
till
midnight
check
it
out
anytime
your
within
a
few
hours
of
philadelphia
if
im
not
mistaken
wip
has
the
highest
sports
talk
ratings
in
the
nation
like
i
said
i
live
in
philly
so
i
can
hear
fan
andor
wip
whenever
i
want
but
i
cannot
stand
wip
and
it
isnt
because
i
loathe
the
philly
sports
teams
the
phillies
are
my
favorite
nl
team
yanks
are
favorite
al
and
the
eagles
arent
too
bad
either
there
are
two
big
problems
emphasis
on
the
home
teams
especially
the
eagles
unlike
the
fan
hosts
who
can
at
least
answer
a
question
about
an
outoftown
team
if
a
caller
asks
the
wip
hosts
seem
to
have
no
clue
about
any
team
that
doesnt
play
on
broad
street
also
fans
periodic
sports
updates
every
minutes
gives
sports
news
and
scores
from
around
the
country
its
very
rare
to
hear
an
outoftown
score
being
reported
on
wip
hosts
with
the
exception
of
jody
macdonald
who
i
miss
from
his
days
at
fan
none
of
the
hosts
really
seems
to
have
both
a
broad
knowledge
of
the
sport
or
a
good
onair
presence
the
worst
is
gary
cobb
who
seems
to
have
been
hired
solely
on
the
basis
that
he
used
to
play
for
the
eagles
anyway
thats
my
two
cents
on
the
whole
fan
vs
wip

baerga
looks

its
possible
his

would

will
baerga
consistently
turn
twice

many
double

however
alomar
has
established
a

baerga
has
not
i
would

uh
right
you
also

you

barring
a

with
nobody

what
fraction
of
all

come
on
solo
hr
most
runs
are
scored
because
there
happened
to
be
players
on
base
when
the
batter
did
something
good
i
use
the
phrase
happened
to
be
advisedly
lots
of
people
have
tried
to
figure
out
who
the
players
are
who
have
the
most
ability
to
turn
it
up
a
notch
in
clutchrbiwhatever
situations
and
what
theyve
found
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
such
an
ability
to
any
measurable
extent
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
people
who
tend
to
do
things
that
would
cause
an
rbi
if
there
were
somebody
on

end
up
getting
rbis
proportional
to
how
many
of
their
teammates
obliged
by
being
in
position
my
mistake
i
agree
me
too
rbi
are
a
worthless
stat
of
course
so
is
stolen
bases
because
sometimes
runners
are
in
front
of
a
player
that
would
otherwise
run
and
of
course
pitchers
pitch
differently
with
different
people
on
different
bases
so
batting
average
slugging
and
obp
out
too
hmmm
i
guess
homers
would
not
count
then
either
my
point
rbi
might
not
be
a
perfect
stat
but
nothing
is
and
no
stat
or
lack
of
can
tell
me
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
maybe
no
stat
can
tell
me
either
but
some
people
are

just
know
it

from
ian
m
derby
attn
those
who
live

back
in

i
was
listening
to

and
i
remember
the
morning
guys
were
talking
with
mayor
ed
rendell
the
topic
of
conversation
was
a
new
ball
park
for
the
phillies
the
location
for
this
new
park
was
suggested
to
be
near
st
station
at
the
time
the
mayor
was
optimisitic
that
in
the
future
this
could
become
a
reality
has
there
been
any
new
news
on
this
subject
or
is
it
still
a
pipe
dream
i
know
the
city
of
philadelphia
has
other
projects
ahead
such
as
the
new
convention
center
and
the
upcoming
spectrum
ii
but
it
would
be
nice
to
see
this
a
reality
it
is
planned
that
the
phillies
leave
the
vet
and
leave
it
solely
to
the
eagles
and
if
thats
the
case
the
eagles
should
make

hi
baseball
fans
so
what
do
you
say
dont
you
think
he
deserves
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
seriously
being
considered
for
it
as
is
lee
smith
ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chance
or
darrell
evans
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
takes
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddie
murray
and
jeff
reardon
i
am
trying
to
think
how
to
respond
to
this
without
involving
personal
feeling
or
perceptions
and
i
can
not
without
having
stats
to
back
up
my
points
however
i
think
you
approached
this
the
wrong
way
i
believe
all
of
the
people
mentioned
here
deserve
the
hall
of
fame
more
than
dave
kingman
does
i
feel
they
were
all
much
better
players
i
am
not
saying
i
fell
they
deserve
to
go
but
that
they
would
deserve
it
more
imho
dave
kingman
definately
not
they
guy
only
had
a
couple
of
years
were
he
could
hit
with
atleast
a
respectable
averag
the
rest
of
his
career
i
do
not
think
he
was
very
feared
by
pitchers
i
also
do
not
think
he
did
a
lot
for
the
game
i
mean
really
i
am
a
met
fan
he
was
a
met
for
part
of
his
career
and
i
still
would
not
back
him
for
the
hall
of
fame
dave
winfield
i
think
so
he
is
feared
by
pitchers
he
has
had
several
season
where
he
hit
for
a
respectable
average
and
his
production
numbers
are
in
my
opinion
without
stats
better
than
kingmans
probably
by
quite
a
bit
i
also
perceive
him
to
be
a
leader
maybe
not
as
much
as
some
other
people
but
none
the
less
a
leader
i
think
he
has
made
substantial
contributions
to
the
game
of
baseball
and
to
society
examples
of
this
are
some
of
the
charitable
things
he
has
done
i
know
some
of
this
from
when
he
was
with
the
yankees
i
think
he
the
type
of
player
that
kids
can
look
up
to
and
while
this
is
definately
not
the
only
criteria
for
the
hall
of
fame
i
think
it
deserves
some
consideration
lee
smith
maybe
i
would
have
to
see
his
stats
again
but
he
definately
would
deserve
to
go
before
the
likes
of
kingman
darrell
evans
no
eddie
murray
maybe
he
has
had
a
very
good
career
he
is
a
leader
although
a
silent
one
he
is
a
good
role
model
are
the
stats
good
enough
i
am
not
sure
but
i
would
once
again
believe
they
are
much
better
than
kingmans
both
the
average
as
well
as
the
power
numbers
but
not
as
good
as
winfields
just
think
eddie
did
not
have
as
much
publicity
for
most
of
his
great
years
jeff
reardon
my
guess
is
no
but
it
kind
of
depends
on
his
numbers
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
would
take
lee
smith
first
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall
of
fame
consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
well
i
strongly
disagree
here
both
of
these
guys
deserve
it
for
sure
i
talked
about
leadership
above
both
of
these
guys
are
leaders
and
have
been
instumental
in
leading
their
teams
to
the
post
season
robin
does
have
very
good
offensive
numbers
both
average
and
power
and
ozzie
has
okay
numbers
offensively
the
difference
with
ozzie
is
that
if
you
gave
him
a
home
run
for
every
run
he
saved
by
making
an
incredible
play
at
shortstop
he
would
have
shattered
aarons
home

mark
by
now
how
many
of
those
great
plays
saved
games
how
many
of
those
great
plays
motivated
his
team
to
rally
and
win
a
game
while
i
believe
both
of
these
guys
have
numbers
baseball
is
about
more
than
numbers
or
at
least
winning
at
baseball
is
about
more
than
numbers
both
of
these
guys
are
proven
stars
and
belong
in
the
hall
of
fame
as
does
george
brett
who
also
belongs
in
this
class
of
player
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
steve
garvey
i
am
not
sure
probably
not
but
i
guess
i
could
see
someone
making
a
case
for
him
jack
morris
once
again
not
my
first
choice
but
i
can
see
why
someone
might
bring
up
his
name
kirby
puckett
probably
the
only
reason
i
do
not
say
definately
is
he
still
has
time
left
in
his
career
if
he
continues
doing
what
he
has
been
then
my
probably
will
turn
into
a
definately
nolan
ryan
is
there
really
any
doubt
i
think
i
heard
something
about
him
having
some
records
maybe
they
were
not
all
good
i
dont
know
i
did
not
hear
any
of
them
just
the
number
he
has
the
numbers
he
has
the
contributions
to
the
game
and
community
and
he
is
a
great
role
model
i
would
not
say
that
he
is
the
best
pitcher
to
ever
pitch
the
game
probably
not
even
top
but
he
would
be
the
first
pitcher
i
would
put
in
the
hall
of
fame
because
of
his
accomplishments
nohitters
strikeouts
respectable
numbers
even
with
some
weaker
teams
you
can
go
on
and
on
i
really
hope
he
gets
all
the
possible
votes
so
in
summing
up
i
have
groups
those
that
belong
those
that
probably
do
but
i
am
not
sure
and
those
that
i
lean
towards
saying
dont
belong
at
least
not
without
my
seeing
stats
and
possibly
hearing
reasons
why
they
should
go
yes
winfield
yount
brettnot
in
your
mail
o
smith
puckett
and
ryan
maybe
murray
and
l
smith
no
reardon
garvey
morris
evans
and
definately
kingman
as
i
said
i
do
not
have
the
stats
around
so
i
do
not
have
numbers
to
back
this
up
these
are
entirely
my

second

he
probably
didnt

as
good
a

as
alomar
last

guess
which
line
is
which
ba
obp
slg
ab
h
hr
bb
x
y
the
walks
should
give
it
away
obps
in
general
somewhat
more
valuable
than
slugging
and
alomars
edge
in
obp
was
quite
a
bit
larger
than
baergas
edge
in
slugging
im
no
sdcn
but
whats
more
valuable
hits
more
doubles
more
hrs
or
more
triples
and
bbs
lets
not
forget
the
extra
sbs
how
many
cs
of
course
the
hits
and
homers
are
more
valuable
but
dont
forget
the
outs
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
baergas
higher
raw
numbers
are
due
to
him
having
more
playing
time
and
thus
he
had
more
hits
and
homers
but
dont
forget
the
cost
of
those
outs
btw
just
to
answer
your
question
alomar
had
sb
and
cs
baerga
had
sb
and
cs
which
gives
a
minute
plus
on
alomars
side
something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his

id
say
you
could
make

the

hmmmwhat
about

baerga
got
clobbered
by

him
in

by
a
lesser
margin
even
putting

any

factors
a

in

is
more
productive
than
a

with

the
issue
has
been

i

you

up

they

the
fact
is
that

ate
up
a

has
to

for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with

pitching
he
decides

bench
lankform
a

play
jordan

gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with

uses
luis

a

with
no

educate
yourself

manager
of

lankford
injured
himself
in

previous
game
and
torre
was
resting
him
as
far
as
the

whitten
adds
some
more

if
jordan
continues

by
the

standard
of

at
which
time
mauch
was
probably
desperate
for
a
win
at
any
cost
because
the

substantial
lead
had
evaporated
the
way
they
were
used
at
that
time
may
have
made
the
problem
worse
although
bunning
had
one
of
his
sharpest
games
of

going

well
after

ive
decided
to
road
trip
to

take
in
a

this

a
couple
games
at
county

will
be
great
to
relieve
tension
but
i
thought
why
not
go
to
wrigley
for
a
game
too
i
see
the
cubs
are
playing
the

on
sat
start
i
believe
thats
eastern

listed
i
figured
it
would
be
fun
to
bounce
down
to
wrigley
for
the

game
and
live
it
up
a

im

anyone

have

im

getting
there
an

two
early
and
paying
through

for

to
keep
things
easy
is
it
probable
that
ill
be
able
to
walk
up
and
get
bleacher

or
on

day
i
figure
since
its
early
in

rynos
out
and
the
weather
isnt
great
i
should
be
able
to
get

if

can
i
call

joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
for
your
information
lankford
is
injured
i
think
it
is
his
shoulder
or
rib
cage
so
he
could
not
use
him
as
a
pinch
hitter
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
i
do
believe
that
whiten
was
a
very
good
aquisition
for
the
cards
he
does
not
have
too
much
offensive
capabilities
but
he
is
an
awesome
defensively
since
when
have
the
cardnials
actually
thought
of
offense
instead
of
defense
i
forgot
who
st
louis
gave
up
for
him
but
it
was
not
too
much
as
far
as
gilkey
is
concerned
he
is
a
leftfielder
and
so
is
brian
jordan
who
beat
him
out
i
expect
to
see
a
gilkeyjordan
platoon
in
lf
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
i
agree
with
you
on
this
one
as
soon
as
larkin
threw
that
ball
i
knew
that
lankford
was
a
dead
bird
but
how
could
dent
have
known
that
larkin
would
make
a
perfect
throw
i
strongly
believe
that
torre
is
one
of
the
best
managers
in
baseball
dont
forget
the
overachieving
cards
of
that
won
all
those
close
games
and
went
from
last
place
to
second
place
although
they
were
oveshadowed
by
the
braves
twins
last
to
first
climb
he
won
a
division
title
and
barely
lost
a
pennant
race
when
he
was
with
the
braves
why
atlanta
ever
even
considered
firing
him
i
will
never
understand
with
torre
at
the
controls
the
cardinals
are
heading
in
the
right
direction
one
more
thing
one
game
does
not
make
a
season
yes
they
lost
to
the
reds
but
with
the
second
best
pitching
staff
in
the
national
league
first
in
the
east
and
a
pretty
good
offense
the
redbirds
will
win
a
lot
more
than
they
lose
maybe
this
is
the
year
that
they
will
go
all
the

up

much
period
he
needs
to
lose
about
pounds
not
gain
more
bulk
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
i
understand
from
an
unreliable
source
that
canseco
was
considered
expendable
by
the
as
when
he
refused
to
accept
any
coaching
about
his
batting
stance
the
as
brain
trust
came
to
believe
that
his
back
problems
were
exacerbated
if
not
caused
by
having
a
wide
open
stance
closing
it
quickly
and
then
swinging
with
a
lot
of
torque
thats
a
paraphrase
of
what
i
remember
in
any
event
canseco
took
the
road
that
he
and
he
alone
would
decide
his
stance
and
the
as
began
to
believe
that
he
would
either
reinjure
himself
or
begin
to
lose
his
ability
to
hit
for
both
average
and
power

from
salting

large

of
a

i

sound

the

objected
about
this

cansecos

john

rbis
and
runs
scored
are
the
two
most
important
offensive
statistics
actually
theyre
pretty
worthless
if
you
want
to
evaluate
players
with
stats
rbis
and
runs
scored
should
be
banned
all
they
do
is
confuse
victims
of
mediot
brainwashing
like
yourself
you
can
talk
about
obp
and
slg
all
you
want
but
the
fact
remains
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
uh
so
youve
just
explained
why
we
use
obp
and
slg
to
evaluate
players
precisely
because
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
traditional
baseball
stats
have
gotten
way
too
far
away
from
methods
which
enable
fans
to
see
who
contributes
to
those
runs
scored
thats
where
obp
slg
runs
created
linear
weights
etc
come
in
these
simplify
matters
so
that
we
can
more
easily
measure
a
players
offensive
contribution
to
the
teams
runs
scored
thank
you
for
making
our
case
have
a
nice
day
greg
from
ian

no
hes
not
nuts
wip
is
second
to
none
the
sports
station
they
dont
have
tony
bruno
working
espn
radio
and
al
morganti
doing
friday
night
hockey
because
they
suck
i
live
in
richmond
va
but
i
visit
phila
often
and
on
the
way
i
get
wtem
washington
and
wip
i
hear
the
fan
at
night
wherever
i
go
the
signal
used
to
be
wnbc
when
they
played
golden
oldies
because
you
cant
avoid
it
of
those
three
wip
has
the
best
hosts
hands
down
chuck
cooperstein
isnt
a
homer
and
neither
is
jody
mac
wtem
is
too
generic
to
be
placed
in
the
catergory
in
fact
if
you
have
heard
wtem
and
the
fan
you
notice
the
theme
music
is
identicalsame
ownership
i
think
so
wip
is
totally
original
their
hosts
actually
have
a
personality
this
is
a
knock
at
tem
the
team
not
the
fan
because
mike
and
the
mad
dog
and
sommers
are
good
i
mean
comparing
the
morning
guys
in
philadelphia
to
the
ones
in
washington
is
a
total
joke
anyway
i
like
the
fan
and
wip
but
i
think
the
edge
goes
to
ip
when
i
get
back
from
philly
i
go
into
withdraw
cause
richmond
has
nada
except
the
national
sports
line
and
those
guys
are
totally
clueless
i
was
really
mad
when
wcau
was
cancelled
because
they
had
steve
fredericks
doing
sports
phone
after
the
phillies
games
wcau
is
another
strong
station
now
its
an
oldies
station
but
they
still
have
the
phillies
i
started
listening
to
the
fan
because
i
heard
he
went
there
i
finally
heard
him
last
summer
and
he
wasnt
the
same
guy
those
ny
fans
got
to
him
i
was
glad
to
hear
him
back
in
philly
when
i
went
to
see
a
few
eagles
games
i
will
admit
i
am
die
hard
eagles
fan
and
wip
is
basically
an
eagles
station
days
a
year
but
i
bet
you
the
phillies
are
in
control
right
now
about
the
knock
on
g
cobb
i
like
him
he
knows
the
eagles
like
a
book
i
remember
the
weekend
before
they
went
to
play
san
fran
when
everyone
thought
the
eagles
would
be
blown
away
cobb
said
that
the
eagles
usually
play
their
best
when
no
one
believe
they
can
win
well
they
were
inches
shy
of
pulling
the
victory
well
thats
my
from
ian
m
derby
since
someone
brought
up

radio
howabout

anyone
give
an
opinion
which
city
do
you
think
has
the
best
sports
coverage
in
terms
of
print
media
these
are
general
questions
is
the
washington
post
better
than
the
philadelphia
inquier
or
the
ny

howabout
the
philadelphia

something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his
home
park
not
necessarily
it
could
mean
that
or
it
could
mean
that
he
just
hit
a
lot
better
at
home
than
he
did
on
the
road
see
frank
thomas
homeroad
splits
in
for
an
example
i
would
guess
that
some
of
alomars
split
is
due
to
the
skydome
but
most
of
it
is
probably
due
just
to
coincidence
theres
no
way
to
be
sure
of
course
but
the
only
hitters
the
skydome
seems
to
regularly
help
a
lot
are
right
handed
home
run
hitters
and
alomar
is
not
a
home
run
hitter
id
say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
being
about
equal
right
now
tp
rated
baerga
higher
actually
only
because
of
tps
bogus
fielding
stats
which
rate
alomar
as
the
worst
defensive
second
baseman
in
the
league
on
a
career
basis
i
think
tps
fielding
stats
may
mean
something
but
on
a
seasonal
basis
it
comes
up
with
ridiculous
results
like
this
alomar
may
not
be
the
god
of
fielding
the
media
says
he
is
but
he
sure
isnt
the
worst
in
baseball
offensively
tp
rate
alomar
much
higher
last
year
regarding
the
a
vs
b
argument
ill
just
say
theyre
both
very
good
players
with
different
strengths
and
a
bright
future

beating
the
incident
at
dodger
stadium
on
wednesday
to
death
but
i
havent
seen
anything
in
rsb
yet
gerald
perry
of
the
cardinals
pinch
hit
in
the
eighth
inning
with
two
on
and
his
club
down
by
a
run
he
stroked
a
line
drive
into
the
right
field
corner
the
ball
cleared
the
threefoot
high
fence
and
went
into
the
crowd
darryl
racing
over
from
right
center
got
to
the
spot
in
time
to
reach
his
glove
up
over
the
short
fence
but
he
missed
the
ball
a
fan
sitting
in
the
front
row
wearing
a
mitt
reached
up
and
caught
the
ball
home
run
now
ive
seen
the
replay
several
times
and
i
have
concluded
that
darryl
missed
the
ball
and
that
the
fans
glove
was
essentially
behind
darryls
several
dodger
fans
with
seats
in
the
immediate
vicinity
have
claimed
that
the
fan
unquestionably
interfered
with
strawberry
what
cannot
be
disputed
however
is
that
the
fan
who
caught
the
ball
never
took
his
eye
off
it
he
was
oblivious
to
where
the
fielder
was
playing
he
was
also
quite
exuberant
as
soon
as
he
realized
he
had
made
the
catch
that
exuberance
disappeared
immediately
however
when
strawberry
went
into
a
tirade
at
the
man
all
reports
indicate
he
used
a
lot
of
profanity
and
accused
the
man
of
interference
and
therefore
of
costing
the
dodgers
a
game
shortly
afterwards
other
fans
hurled
food
and
beverages
toward
the
man
who
made
the
catch
dodger
stadium
officials
started
to
remove
him
from
the
park
but
then
relented
and
just
relocated
him
to
another
area
in
an
interview
after
the
game
lasorda
blamed
the
fan
for
the
loss
strawberry
also
went
into
a
tirade
about
how
the
fans
are
stupid
and
they
dont
care
about
winning
la
times
columnists
similarly
blasted
the
man
who
made
the
catch
before
each
dodger
game
the
public
address
announcer
makes
a
speech
wherein
he
says
that
fans
are
welcome
to
the
souvenirs
of
balls
that
are
hit
into
the
stands
as
long
as
they
do
not
interfere
with
any
that
are
in
the
field
of
play
was
the
fan
wrong
should
he
have
been
more
aware
of
the
situation
and
acted
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
interference
or
was
he
human
and
just
reacting
by
the
way
he
is
a
season
ticket
holder
and
on
his
request
the
dodgers
have
relocated
his
seats
to
another
area
of
the
stadium
where
future
interference
is
impossible
others
have
questioned
why
darryl
should
be
so
concerned
with
what
the
fan
did
when
he
has
a
grand
total
of
rbi
through
the
first
nine
games
i
question
what
he
was
doing
in
right
center
with
a
lefthanded
pull
hitter
up
and
the
game
on
the
line
had
he
been
closer
to
the
play
he
certainly
would
have
had
a
much
better
chance
of
catching
the
ball

i
guess
the
big
debate
continues
as

it
was

astacio
pitched
ok

had
control
trouble
all
night
in
the
first
he
walked
a
batter
balked
him
to
second
then
a
single
scored
the
run
with
the
batter
taking
second
on
the
throw
home
another
single
made
the
score
cards
lasorda
tried
a
new
line
up
featuring
butler
reed
and
piazza
batting
third
darryl
and
eric
were
benched
in
favor
of
snyder
and
webster
piazza
homered
in
the
first
to
make
the
score
cards
the
dodgers
tied
the
game
in
the
second
on
a
two
out
single
by
offerman
by
the
fourth
inning
astacio
had
already
made
about
pitches
but
the
score
was
still
the
dodger
defense
made
several
impressive
plays
piazza
looked
great
behind
the
plate
gunning
down
a
runner
trying
to
steal
second
throwing
a
runner
out
at
first
who
had
strayed
a
bit
from
first
base
etc
karros
also
made
a
spectacular
play
keeping
a
ball
from
going
into
the
outfield
the
runner
on
first
was
so
sure
that
ball
was
going
through
he
just
kept
running
past
second
karros
got
up
and
threw
to
third
and
easily
got
the
runner
at
third
my
heart
sank
in
the
when
gross
got
up
to
warm
up
in
the
bullpen
astacio
was
lifted
for
a
pinch
hitter
and
when
gross
entered
the
game
with
the
score
still
dodger
fans
just
knew
it
was
over
gross
was
relieving
because
he
stunk
on
tuesday
pitching
just
innings
forcing
lasorda
to
use
much
of
his
bullpen
the
inning
game
had
the
same
effect
the
next
nightso
only
gross
was
fresh
given
his
light
work
out
tuesday
gross
lived
up
to
his
name
he
walked
the
first
batter
gave
up
a
hit
to
the
second
and
walked
the
bases
loaded
after
a
grounder
resulted
in
a
force
at
home
zeile
lifted
a
scoring
fly
ball
to
make
it
cards
gross
paid
little
attention
to
the
runners
and
the
next
thing
you
knew
the
cards
had
stolen
a
fourth
run
the
runner
on
first
was
eventually
tagged
out
in
the
run
down
but
the
run
had
scored
long
before
that
meanwhile
the
dodgers
mounted
little
offense
after
the
second
inning
lee
smith
pitched
the
ninth
he
had
little
trouble
getting
karros
and
wallach
does
anyone
have
trouble
with
wallach
these
days
cory
snyder
collected
his
first
hit
as
a
dodger
a
single
but
that
was
all
the
offense
the
dodgers
could
mount
smith
got
his
third
straight
save
against
the
dodgers
and
all
i
got
was
my
free

a
good
look

lets
give
him
some
time
in
aaa
javy
lopez
has
proven
over
ab
in
the
minor
leagues
that
he
is
ready
to
play
in
the
majors
he
is
not
being
rushed
players
who
are
clearly
too
good
for

and
play
behind
stiffs
at
the
major
league
level
are
wasting
their
time
and
may
actually
have
a
court
case
against
major
league
management
for
keeping
them
at
aaa
no
maybe
i
need
to
improve
my
writing
skills
lopez
who
is
very
ordinary
defensively
is
not
likely
to
hit
so
well
at
age
unless
lopez
is
me
defensively
im
and
born
to
play
second
base
he
belongs
in
the
major
leagues
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
gee
i
dont
know
abs
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
about
as
good
as
your
reasoning
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
every
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
as
a
gm
valentine
isnt
saying
he
should
back
up
hes
saying
he
should
be
put
in
a
position
to
win
the
job
in
the
major
leagues
which
imho
he
would
if
given
the
opportunity
val
if
im
misinterpreting
please
let
me
know
so
far
you
have
come
up
with
two
arguments
against
lopez
he
is
very
ordinary
defensively
he
is
young
and
most
players
suck
when
they
are
young
the
first
is
irrelevant
hes
trying
to
make
the
majors
with
his
bat
and
the
second
involves
seriously
warped
reasoning
valentine
ok
most
players
are
not
ready
for
the
bigs
at
age
see
current
related
posting
on
clayton
one
of
my
favorites
most
players
benefit
rather
than
being
stagnant
or
hurt
by
playing
at
aaa
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
but
the
players
who
are
ready
are
best
and
the
ones
most
likely
to
benefit
from
being
in
the
majors
javy
lopez
is
not
a
middle
oftheroad
prospect
hes
the
real
thing
now
again
the
most
important
thing
a
player
can
do
is
hit
lopez
does
that
miles
better
than
olson
or
berryhill
if
his
defense
is
good
enough
for
greenville
or
richmond
its
good
enough
for
atlanta
if
he
really
was
awful
defensively
he
would
no
longer
be
a
catcher
see
sprague
ed
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
not
superstars
mind
you
but
solid
experienced
veterans
the
braves
have
a
very
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bats
in
the
outfield
an
excellent
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candidate
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hitting
shortstops
the
center
field
platoon
will
probably
hit
however
good
lopez
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differential
in
experience
and
defensive
ability
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
and
he
probably
wont
being
a
reserve
with
the
big
club
oh
where
to
start
ok
first
of
all
solid
good
i
want
good
players
solid
is
one
of
those
words
used
to
describe
nice
white
guys
who
really
arent
very
good
at
baseball
think
of
it
as
twg
without
the
caps
its
a
losing
strategy
to
say
we
have
solid
guys
we
dont
need
to
improve
you
used
it
four
times
in

btw
same
for

i
might
add
though
that
greg
olson
and
damon
berryhill
arent
exactly
carter
and
fisk
olson
has
played
three
years
berryhill
five
although
and
were
a
wash
the
only
difference
imho
between
olson
and
valle
is
the
supporting
cast
two
big
bats

i

but
i
find
mr

call

not
at
all
i
am
talking
about

winning

last

you
are
about
to
launch
into
a
fantasy
about
the
red
jays
and
how
toronto
would
have
done
with
viola
on
their
team
viola
didnt
play
for
toronto
last
year
morris
did
the
problem
with
your
nihilistic
approach
roger
is
that
it
takes
all
the
sense
out
of
the
game
by
your
line
of
reasoning
if
a
guy
hits
into
a
double
play
with
one
out
and
the
bases
loaded
theres
no
point
in
saying
that
that
was
a
bad
thing
to
do
if
his
team
won
anyway
or
speculating
on
what
might
have
happened
if
things
had
gone
otherwise
so
the
double
play
is
merely
an
event
that
happened
in
the
course
of
a
game
that
was
eventually
won
or
lost
for
unknown
reasons
after
all
any
speculation
involves
constructing
a
fantasy
about
what
would
have
happened
but
didnt
roger
do
you
ever
worry
that
the
next
pencil
you
drop
will
fall
to
the
ceiling
instead
or
are
you
willing
to
consider
empirical
evidence
teams
go
to
the
postseason
when
they
win
more
games
than
anybody
else
in
their
division
if
they
dont
make
the
postseason
they
dont
win
the
series
will
you
agree
that
winning
a
division
is
a
useful
intermediate
goal
in
ringcollecting
if
so
you
must
agree
that
winning
games
is
a
useful
intermediate
goal
towards
winning
the
division
and
our
disagreements
come
when
we
consider
how
to
win
games
in
your
viewpoint
as
expressed
winning
games
happens
for
reasons
that
cannot
be
analyzed
while
many
of
us
are
thinking
things
like
base
runners
are
good
outs
are
bad
and
therefore
walks
are
better
than
double
plays
with
the
bases
loaded
you
are
thinking
things
like
its
a
team
game
so
perhaps
the
double
play
will
cause
some
mysterious
team
dynamics
that
will
cause
the
team
to
win
today
the
result
is
that
it
becomes
impossible
to
say
anything
about
individual
players
perhaps
atlanta
would
have
won
the
series
with
me
playing
left
field
after
all
perhaps
in
some
way
my
knowledge
and
personality
would
have
helped
the
team
more
than
my
complete
lack
of
skill
would
have
hurt
it
therefore
i
could
be
an
extremely
valuable
player
did
dave
winfield
have
anything
to

jays
victory
probably
but
how
do
you
know
if
you
replace
him

andres
galarraga
perhaps
the
jays
would
have
won
perhaps
they
would
have
lost
perhaps
they
would
have
defected
to
alpha
centauri
bearing
in
mind
that
the
flying
saucers
would
not
have
landed
in
midseason
had
winfield
been
dhing
for
toronto
was
babe
ruth
a
good
player
he
played
on
some
wswinning
teams
but
did
he
have
anything
to
do
with
their
success
it
is
generally
accepted
that
ernie
banks
was
a
good
baseball
player
and
jarvis
brown
and
dan
schatzeder
werent
it
seems
to
me
that
anybody
who
would
deny
this
needs
to
provide
the
proof
now
we
have
observed
things
about
baseball
over
the
years
both
empirically
and
by
looking
at
the
rulebook
it
is
necessary
to
score
more
runs
than
ones
opponent
to
win
the
game
so
it
would
seem
important
to
score
runs
and
to
prevent
ones
opponent
from
scoring
runs
are
scored
while
a
team
is
batting
and
an
inning
ends
after
the
third
out
so
it
would
seem
that
making
outs
is
bad
while
hitting
home
runs
is
good
players
have
tendencies
to
hit
or
pitch
at
certain
levels
and
these
are
usually
somewhat
consistent
from
year
to
year
we
do
use
these
statistics
to
predict
winners
and
so
do
you
to
make
some
flat
predictions
barry

larkin
this

the
braves
will
finish
ahead
of
the
rockies
in
the
standings
the
tigers
will
score
more
runs
than
the
royals
but
will
also
give
up
more
i
would
be
astonished
if
any
of
these
turned
out
to
be
false
and
i
suspect
so
would
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
pretty
sure
i
can
predict
all
the
division
winners
this
year
given
guesses
per
division
and
this
is
certainly
better
than
random
chance
and
almost
statistically

is
pretty
valuable
but
id
rather
watch
and
root
for
the
lower
obp
guys
who
can
actually
hit
the
ball
now
this
is
a
legitimate
point
baseball
is
entertainment
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
people
who
find
certain
styles
of
play
more
entertaining
than
others
regardless
of
their
winvalue
personally
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
slugbunt
i
doubt
its
a
highpercentage
play
but
i
get
a
big
kick
out
of
it
i
am
willing
to
live
with
the
bad
consequences
in
exchange
for
the
fun
of
course
this
is
not
the
same
as
claiming
as
some
do
that
galarragas
inability
to
defer
gratification
isnt
hurting
his
team
because
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
or
is
an
rbi
guy
or
whatever
and
finally
id
like
to
point
out
that
many
high
obp
guys
draw
their
walks
more
because
pitchers
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
because
they
have
a
great
eye
im
not
sure
i
used
to
think
this
was
true
but
more
and
more
im
becoming
convinced
that
its
the
other
way
around
among
players
with
the
physical
ability
to
hit
the
ball
real
hard
the
patient
ones
are
the
ones
who
get
the
chance
to
do
it
a
lot
lets
break
down
the
four
basic
categories
of
hitter
according
to
whether
they
are

and
whether
they

as

i
can
tell
all
the
categories
are

it
really
looks
like
the
two
are
independent
nobody
could
possibly
be
afraid
of
craig
grebeck
at
the
plate
and
yet
he
walks
quite
a
lot
part
of
that
undoubtedly
is
being
small
of
stature
but
surely
major
league
pitchers
can
hit
that
sort
of
target
at
least
times
out
of
randy
milligan
is
an
even
better
example
hes
only
shown
noticeable
power
for

place

a

umpire
would
not
have
tried

force
gant

in

situation
a

would
do
as
hes
been

to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in

box
sooner
to
try

cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length

games
i
for

am
glad
to
see
this

and
hope
more
umpires
will
do
as
hirschbeck
did
in
instructing
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
so
what
if
the
previous
strike
call
was
bogus
its
in
the
past
it
cant
be
changed
get
back
in
there
and
deal
with
the
next
pitch
sorry
sherri
but
i
cant
agree
with
this
particular
incident
while
im
all
for
cutting
down
the
number
of
chainrattles
and
other
examples
of
rampant
hargroving
there
was
a
difference
here
since
time
immemorial
batters
have
complained
about
calls
so
have
pitchers
and
catchers
usually
nothing
happens
unless
the
league
notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing
complaints
hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
gant
said
something
about
the
call
stepped
out
of
the
box
and
turned
away
from
hirschbeck
as
a
hitter
alibet
of
little
consequence
but
with
a
decent
eye
whenever
receiving
the
short
end
of
the
stick
on
a
questionable
call
id
want
a
moment
or
two
out
of
the
box
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
rethink
the
strike
zone
based
on
the
experience
of
the
last
pitch
and
if
i
was
really
angry
at
the
ump
id
rather
turn
away
and
catch
my
breath
than
turn
to
him
and
say
something
that
might
get
me
tossed
especially
at
a
key
moment
in
the
game
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
at
that
point
cox
came
out
on
the
field
the
pitch
was
thrown
and
many
other
braves
left
the
dugout
cox
was
tossed
protecting
his
player
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
gant
kept
his
cool
enough
to
stay
in
the
game
its
a
small
sample
size
but
based
on
what
i
saw
in
that
game
mark
hirschbeck
has
a
hairtrigger
temper
and
a
need
to
play
god
on
the
field
not
good
qualities
for
an
umpire
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
for
future
appearances
of
hirschbeck
in
the
future
in
order
to
improve
my
sample
size
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire

we

with

since
there
is
no
absolutely
necessary
reason
to

i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
pointless
if
a
gm
is
trying

put
together
a
winning
team
he
might
consider
era
he
might
consider
attitude
he
might
consider
past
performance
in
key
situations
but
what
he
is
looking

is
not
the
player
that
he
considers
the
best
the
gm
is
looking
for
the
player
he
thinks
can
help

we
cannot
isolate
completely
roger
but
we
can
make
a
pretty
good
estimate
i
wont
claim
to
split
hairs
and
say
that
we
can
really
measure
who
was
better
robby
alomar
or
carlos
baerga
last
year
the
difference
is
too
close
to
call
but
larkin
and
lee
clemens
and
morris
the
differences
are
too
great
there
in
your
measure
of
the
game
why
should
a
team
that
has
just
won
it
all
ever
replace
a
single
player
since
they
are
now
clearly
best
how
can
they
do
better
yet
every
team
can
always
find
someplace
where
they
beleive
they
can
improve
the
team
they
can
always
find
a
player
a
little
better
than
one
they
already
have
btw
by
my
definitions
the
best
player
is
the
one
who
does
the
most
things
to
help
his
team
win
i
will
allow
that
this
could
vary
depending
on
who
else
is
on
the
team
by
having
aptitudes
one
team
needs
more
than
others
baseball
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individual
talents
it
is
absurd
to
judge
the
success
or
failure
of
an
individual
by
the
success
or
failure
of
his
teammates
whom
he
did
not
choose
at
least
in
most
cases
morris

year

played
on
a
team
with
joe
carter
robby
alomar
tom
henke
juan
guzman
john
olerud
et

clemens

he
was

john

he

talking
about
people
on

always
playing
and
not
sitting
out
because
of
a

he
said
if
they
do
they

kick
their

the

was
in

and
it
was

saw
it
at

bleeped

mitch
williams
talked
about
the
team
being
a
bunch
of
throwaways
from
other
teams
and
that
is
why
they
are
so
close
kruk
said
that
they
all
get
along
this
year
last
year
he
said
they
hated
the

i
assume
he
was
joking

he

you

lets
hear
it
in
some

actually
i
question
whether
either
knepper
or
postema
arent
old
news
at
this
point
although
what
i
have
read
of
postemas

is
interesting
there
is
a
school
of
thought
that
suggests
that
silence
consent
i
agree
this
far
whereas
this
idea
may
not
apply
to
everything
in
life
it
certainly
should
apply
to
a
forum
of
public
discussion
sez
you
if
youve
been
reading

lately
youll
find
that
even
elementary
school
children
have
had
access
to
our

albeit
in
an

its
making
me
think
a
little
more
carefully
about
some
of
the
things
i
post
that
does
not
come
out
in
what
you
say
down
the
road
here
in
conclusion
if
someone
like
austin
wants
to
post
his
drivel
in
some
obscure
newsgroup
that
i
dont
read
fine
hes
got
the
right
to
rant
rave
and
drool
all
he
wants
to
in
the
name
of
free

but
if
he
drools
in
a
newsgroup
that
i
read
then
i
will
support
the
right
of
anyone
to
provide
rebuttal
to
his
drooling
yo
even

you

dont
you
want

to

to

you

you

what

all
you
have
to
do
is
defeat
it
with
better

more
and
better

yours
is
the
easy
way
out
as
for
knepper
ever
notice
how
sometimes
these

will
say
just
about
any

that
pops
in

when
a

of

you
know
that
often
the
best
copy
for
the

is
the
one
that
isnt
preprepared
they
know
knepper
has
controversial
ideas
about
women
they
pop
some
question
about
postema
an
interesting
related
question
would
be
whether
the
two
ever
appeared
in
the
same
game
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
guess
no
if
my
guess
is
right
knepper
popped
off
about
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
postema
gets
a
book
for
it
and
he
doesnt
now
of
course
you
dont
have

any

if

dont

you

did
in

if

a
reasonable

would
have
recognized
that
ron

was
disturbed
with
the
call
a
reasonable
umpire
would
have
realized
that
there
was
a
game
in
progress
with
two
outs
in
the
ninth
what
ron
gant
did
was
try
to
regain
his
composure
what
a
normal
baseball
player
would
have
done
would
have
been
to
get
into
a
heated
argument
with
the
umpire
and
since
you
cant
argue
balls
and
strikes
he
would
have
been
ejected
from
the
game
ron
gant
by
trying
to
avoid
such
a
conflict
was
penalized
for
showing
some
restraint
incidentally
a
reasonable
home
plate
umpire
would
not
have
been
so
resistant
to
seeking
the
appeal
to
the
first
base
umpire
as
gant
requested
if
the
home
plate
umpire
had
appealed
to
first
the
first
base
umpire
could
have
wrung
up
the
strike
and
gant
would
not
have
been
so
upset
if
the
call
had
been
a
ball
and
the
catcher
had
requested
the
appeal
it
is
likely
the
home
plate
umpire
would
have
asked
for
the
help
finally
the
entire
game
was
pretty
much
a
mockery
of
the
socalled
efforts
to
speed
up
the

the
game
was
played
very
quickly
it
was
just
at
hours
when
the
stuff
happened
in
the

the

they

a

btw
by
my
definitions
the

is
the
one
who
does
the
most
things

i
will
allow
that
this
could
vary
depending

who
else
is
on
the

having
aptitudes
one
team
needs
more
than

then
given
your
definition
of
best
is
it
not
conceivable
that
alfredo
griffin
could
bring
something
to
a
team
that
that
team
needs
to
win
while
larkin
might
not
have
that
something
the

needs
would
griffin
then
be
better
than
larkin
baseball
is

at

not
for
the

of
ranking

toronto

they

they

detroit

you

the

thomas
could
not

theyll
get

anything
the

mandate
a

permitting
only
n
seconds

the

then

a
reasonable
umpire
would
do
as
hes
been
instructed
to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
try
to
cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length
of
games
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
happen
i
agree
that
hirschbeck
was
just
doing
what
he
was
instructed
to
do
and
also
that
gant
should
have
listened
to
him
however
what
is
with
this
policy
of
trying
to
speed
up
the
games
you
are
the
first
person
nonmediot
i
have
seen
endorse
this
policy
i
have
no
problem
with
the
length
of
games
at
all
and
am
tired
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announcers
bitching
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
filled
with
people
looking
at
their
watches
and
shouting
hurry
up
if
i
cough
up
big
bucks
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
games
are
longer
now
for
several
reasonsstuff
deleted
maybe
i
am
just
a
neerdowell
with
nothing
better
to
do
but
i
would
like
to
hear
reasons
why
the
longer
games
upset
you
well
i
dont
want
shorter
games
per
se
but
i
would
like
for
them
to
stop
wasting
so
much
time
during
games
the
gant
incident
is
a
perfect
example
when
a
guy
comes
to
the
plate
he
should
be
up
there
to
hit
not
show
off
or
show
up
the
umpire
which
is
clearly
what
gant
was
doing

clemens

we
have
no

because
we
cannot
separate
morris
contribu

from
the
rest
of
the
teams
there
is
only
one
way
of
determin
ing
best
in
baseball
and
that
is
by
looking
at
the
scoreboard
at
the
end
of
the
game
each
game
determines
which
team
is
the
best
that
day
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
team
that
was
the
best
the
most
often
is
the
best
in
the
division
the
playoffs
determine
the
best
of
the
best
but
the
point
is
that
the
only
decision
making
pro
cess
used
to
determine
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
lates
to
the
teams
not
the
individual
players
there
is
no
method
inherent
in
baseball
of
comparing
individual
performances
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
because
after
all
baseball
is
a
team
game
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
another
is
to
be
able
to
say
ab
solutely
that
player
as
team
would
have
played
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
speculation
impossible
to
ascertain
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemens
contributes
to
a
ws
cham
pionship
more
than
morris
your
evaluation
of
clemens
is
totally
sub
jective
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to
see
that
any
of
you
can
predict
a
ws
winner
with
any
greater
accuracy
than
jeanne
dixon
the
fact
is
that
morris
didnt
win
any
ballgames
toronto
did
in
spite
of
morris
contribution
this
has
been
explained
to
you
exactly
the
jays
won
with
morris
pitching
and
boston
wins
with
clemens
pitching
i
am
not
saying
that
morris
is
better
than
clemens
i
am
saying
that
individual
comparisons
between
players
are
totally
meaningless
and
that
anyone
claiming
that
clemens
is
better
based
on
his
era
has
missed
the
point
of
what
baseball
is
all
about
many
many
times
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp
it
you
dont
have
to
be
rude
you
are
completely
consumed
by
the
post
hoc
ergo

fallacy
for
you
to
say
that
means
that
you
have
either
missed
the
entire
point
of
my
argument
or
you
yourself
have
committed
a
fallacy
ignoratio
elenchi
i
am
not
saying
that
morris
is
better
than
clemens
because
he
has
more
rings
although
i
have
tongue
in
cheek
claimed
that
in
the
past
i
am
saying
that
it
is
impossible
to
isolate
an
individuals
performance
from
that
of
his
teams
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
that

performance
with

individuals
per

the

appeal
if
you
look

baseball

i

to
make
assumptions
about
other
people
when
they

neither
of

two
sound
as
though
you
have
kids
and
you
may
not
have
spouses
either
i
wonder
why
you
say
that
i
dont
see
why
having
a
spouse
andor
kids
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it
it
might
if
you
brought
your
kids
to
the
game
and
wanted
them
to
get
home
in
time
to
get
to
bed
at
a
reasonable
hour
in
which
case
id
probably
decide
to
take
my
kids
to
games
on
weekends
as
many
people
do
or
else
be
prepared
to
leave
the
game
early
but
from
what
you
say
later
on
you
dont
bring
your
kids
or
your
spouse
to
the
game
as
it
happens
i
have
a
husband
but
no
kids
and
my
husband
usually
attends
games
with
me
extra
innings
could
put
me
well
past
midnight
even
without
extra
innings
if
the
score
is
beyond
i
cant
see
my
family
that
night
at
all
if
the
next
day
is
a
workday
i
may
have
to
bag
that
as
well
i
can
see
its
a
problem
if
you
dont
bring
your
wife
to
the
ballgame
but
thats
a
problem
even
if
the
game
goes
a
trim
hours
as
far
as
bagging
work
the
next
day
i
dont
really
understand
why
thats
necessary
unless
going
to
a
game
also
means
that
you
consume
vast
quantities
of
beer
i
note
that
this
is
the
case
for
many
guys
if
you
dont
think
you
can
get
up
to
go
to
work
after
a
long
evening
out
then
dont
have
long
evenings
out
during
the
week
all
that
stuff
enters
into
my
consideration
of
even
going
to
a
game
if
you
say
you
dont
care
about
whether
the
game
is
sped
up
impo
you
are
saying
you
dont
care
where
the
time
goes
and
that
the
game
is
for
people
who
dont
have
families
and
dont
have
to
get
up
for
work
the
next
day
look
if
i
pay
between
and
apiece
for
tickets
plus
for
parking
plus
spending
my
time
and
energy
driving
to
and
from
boston
plus
spending
additional
money
on
concessions
etc
at
the
ballpark
then
i
see
going
to
a
game
as
a
considerable
investment
of
time
and
money
i
cant
afford
to
go
to
a
lot
of
games
hence
going
to
a
game
is
a
big
deal
like
going
to
a
play
or
an
opera
maybe
you
have
more
money
than
i
do
and
can
go
to
games
all
year
long
so
its
not
such
a
big
deal
for
you
but
im
not
interested
in

sped

any
more
than
i
want

i
felt
that
going

would
interfere
with

game
that
lasts
a

if
it
lasts
a
long
time
because
there
is
good
baseball
being
played
however
i
dont
like
games
that
take
hours
because
theres
a
lot
of
dead
time
going
on
in
that
game
i
dont
find
anything
exciting
about
watching
batter

pitcher
wander
around
between
pitches
or
watching
the

make
a

walk

out

i
want
to
see
the

not
people
standing
around
i
dont
really
enjoy
watching
nfl

for
example
because

you
dont
really
notice
how
much

there
is
if
you
watch

since

batters

complained
about

however
batters
didnt
use
to
go
for

after
bad
calls

the
degree
they
do
now
unless
the

notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing

hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
everyone
was
told
of
the
new
emphasis
on
speeding
up
games
the
rule
that
hirschbeck
invoked
has
been
in
the
books
a
long
time
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
nobody
including
hirschbeck
ever
said
he
was
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
thats
your
perhaps
colored
by
your
partisanship
of
the
braves
perception
hirschbecks
view
was
that
gant
was
heading
off
for
a
long
walk
and
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
concerning
speeding
games
up
directed
him
into
the
batters
box
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
the
point
is
based
on
the
rulebook
and
the
umpires
instructions
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
request
the
braves
were
already
upset
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire
had

done
as
instructed
you
wouldnt

of

aired
a

this

and
how
they
have
many
of
the

problems
faced
by

american
players
when
they
first
entered

however
although
baseball
has
adjusted
to
the
presence
of
black
players
many
hispanic
players
still
labor
under
the
stereotype
of
being
fireballs
hot

flashy
the
report
also
emphasised
that
despite
the
rantings
my
word
of
jessie
jackson
about
baseballs
discrimination
against
black
players
in
its
upper
echelons
baseball
has
actually
done
much
better
by
black

than
hispanic

another
interesting
point
was
the
language
barrier
problem
the
reporter
elaborated
on
an
interview
with
ruben
sierra
which
he
gave
in
spanish
to
a
spanish
speaking
newspaper
reporter
with
the
fact
that
there
are
maybe
major
baseball
writers
that
speak
spanish
despite
the
fact
that
spanish
is
one
of
if
not
the
easiest
languages
to
learn
so
easy
that
the
author
cormac
mccarthy
learned
spanish
at
age
in
order
to
research
his
book
all
the
pretty
horses
yet
few
mlb
organizations
employ
spanish

personel
one
of
the
exceptions
being
the

as
another
point
nearly
of
latin
american
players
have
some
african
blood
yet
most
report
that
theyd
never
really
felt
black
until
playing
ball
in

us
ironically
enough
it
is
the
early
presence
of
latin
american
baseball
players
in
the
major
leagues
that
support
the
idea
that
baseball
was
integrated
before
the

does
he

so
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
he
certainly
didnt
earn
his
last
one
how
many
games
did
he
blow
in
the
world
series
all
of
the
ones
he
started
he
certainly
did
earn
it
he
was
a
valuable
member
of
the
blue
jay
team
not
particularly
in
the
world
series
during
the
season
he
was
probably
more
valuable
than
say
putting
olerud
out
there
to
pitch
but
yeah
he
was
valuable
in
getting
them
there
in
the
postseason
he
sucked
dirty
canal
water
through
a
straw
the
jays
won
in
spite
of
morris
much
more
than
because
of
him
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
oh
yes
definitely
therefore
morris
is
better
than
clemens
your
definition
of
better
refers
to
some
measurement
on
a
scale
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
winning
ws
rings
umm
roger
return
with
us
to
those
halcyon
days
of
a
few
postings
ago
where
the
poster
valentine
was
replying
to
used
of
ws
rings
as
a
measure
of
better
the
concept
is
called
context
and
you
should
really
become
familiar
with
it
someday
the
facts
are
that
morris
has
shown
us
that
he
has
what
it
takes
to
play
on
a
ws
winning
club
clemens
hasnt
unless
this
transaltes
to
clemens
hasnt
gone
into
lou
gormans
office
with
a
large
caliber
handgun
and
refused
to
come
out
until
hed
been
traded
to
the
jays
im
at
a
complete
loss
as
to
any
possible
meaning
for
it
you
can
go
on
about
what
clemens
has
done
in
the
past
and
claim
that
he
is
better
than
morris
if
you
want
to
but
the
facts
are
that
morris
has
shown
us
that
he
can
win
and
clemens
hasnt
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
over
their
careers
clemens
has
won
of
the
games
hes
started
morris
per
year
clemens
has
averaged
nearly
wins
morris
just
under
would
you
grant
the
proposition
that
preventing
the
other
team
from
scoring
increases
your
chances
of
winning
a
game
if
so
then
consider
that
clemens
allows
innings
pitched
morris
allows
nearly
a
run
more
per
nine
innings
in
fact
jack
morris
has
never
in
his
career
had
an
era
for
a
single
year
as
good
as
clemens
career
era
but
i
forget
in
the
maynardverse
there
was
obviously
some
mystical
significance
to
buckner
missing
that
grounder
in
had
morris
been
on
the
sox
it
would
have
been
a
routine
groundout
right
whether
or
not
clemens
is
better
by
your
standard
of
measurement
is
totally
meaningless
the
object
of
the
game
is
not
to
compile
high
figures
in
statistics
that
you
have
chosen
to
feel
are
important
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
contribute
to
ws
victories
but
this
has
been
patiently
explained
to
you
many
many
times
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp
it
speaking
of
stupid
it
has
been
patiently
and
notsopatiently
explained
to
you
many
times
that
attributing
greatness
to
players
based
on
the
accomplishments
of
their
teams
makes
about
as
much
sense
as
claiming
that
a
racecar
has
the
most
attractive
paint
job
because
it
won
the
race
your
continued
failure
to
not
only
understand
but
even
to
intelligently
reply
to
any
of
the
arguments
presented
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
you
must
have
spent
a
few
too
many
games
in
goal
without
a
mask
dont
give
me
that
shit
if
boston
had
alomar
olerud
henke
and
ward
while
toronto
had
rivera
jack
clark

reardon
things
would
have
looked
a
little
different
last
fall
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
this
lavishing
of
praise
on
morris
makes
me
sick
yes
and
the
dog
would
have
caught
the
rabbit
tooforget
about
what
didnt
happen
and
open
your
eyes
for
once
and
look
out
there
and
see
what
is
really
happening
forget
about
how
morris
shouldnt
have
won
with
an
era
over
when
morris
pitched
last
year
the
jays
won
stop
crying
about
it
and
get
on
with
life
no
one
is
crying
the
jays
won
and
as
a
team
they
certainly
deserved
to
win
at
least
the
al
east
they
performed
well
in
two
short
series
and
won
the
world
series
and
i
congratulate
them
for
it
as
a
red
sox
fan
i
hope
they
keep
morris
i
was
happy
when
they
picked
up
stewart
and
elated
when
they
traded
for
darrin
jackson
you
see
unless
you
believe
in
some
mystical
link
between
morris
and
the
offense
you
can
hardly
help
but
believe
that
the
man
was
credited
with
so
many
wins
last
year
because
he
got
lucky
luck
runs
out
just
like
it
did
in
when
he
pitched
more
innings
than
gave
up
exactly
one
earned
run
more
than
in
and
went
seriously
roger
id
really
like
to
hear
your
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
morris
and
the
morris
which
one
was
a
better
pitcher
and
why
did
morris
somehow
learn
how
to
win
in
the
intervening
ten
years
if
so
then
why
did
he
go
in

can
a

cause

to

more
runs
al
only
please
for
anyone
else
following
along
it
is
a
wellknown
and
demonstrable
fact
that
a
teams
winloss
record
is
closely
related
to
the
number
of
runs
the
team
scores
and
the
number
the
team
allows
its
not
a
definite
hardandfast
function
but
there
is
definitely
a
correlation
in
fact
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
teams
a
and
b
both
score
x
runs
and
team
a
allows
y
runs
for
every
runs
fewer
than
y
that
team
b
allows
it
will
win
another
game
so
for
instance
if
we
look
at
the
toronto
blue
jays
we
find
that
they
scored
runs
and
allowed
of
which
morris
allowed
all
other
things
being
equal
if
frank
viola
with
his
era
had
replaced
jack
morris
for
the
innings
morris
threw
plausible
since
viola
threw
for
boston
the
red
jays
would
have
allowed
about
fewer
runs
or
enough
for
more
wins
now
that
doesnt
take
into
account
that
viola
pitched
half
his
innings
in
fenway
which
is
a
harder
park
to
pitch
in
particularly
for
a
lefthander
than
skydome
so
um
roger
unless
you
really
do
believe
that
a
pitcher
can
somehow
affect
the
number
of
runs
his
team
scores
could
you
enlighten
us
to
the
fallacy
in
this
analysis
clearly
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
claim
that
viola
would
necessarily
have
put
up
a
if
he
had
been
on
the
jay
last
year
but
that
is
not
the
claim
we
look
at
what
the
actual
performances
were
and
evaluate
violas
as
better
than
morris
in
the
sense
that
had
morris
performed
as
viola
did
his
team
would
have
been
better
off
it
takes
an
open
mind
to
really
truly
understand
what

happening
out

yankee
thoughts
yes
everyone
seems
to
be
in
agreement
that
the
yankees
are
finally
moving
in
the
right
direction
they
should
finish
over
this
year
and
maybe
even
be
in
the
pennent
race
in
august
however
i
would
take
back
a
few
moves
the
jim
abbott
trade
i
think
abbott
is
not
only
an
inspirational
person
but
a
great
pitcher
also
he
could
win
the
cy
young
this
year
but
he
wont
because
the
right
side
of
the
yanks
infield
isnt
good
enough
so
why
was
this
not
a
good
trade
jt
snow
how
many
rookies
have
been
able
to
step
in
and
immediately
have
the
impact
that
he
has
had
so
far
on
the
angels
i
know
its
early
but
if
youve
seen
this
kid
hit
field
or
talk
you
can
just
tell
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
tremendous
player
the
yanks
should
have
kept
him
what
about
mattingly
you
ask
well
its
great
that
the
yanks
have
taken
care
of
him
and
remained
loyal
but
hes
years
older
than
snow
and
just
doesnt
have
the
same
bat
speed
as
before
his
back
injury
its
a
shame
but
as
a
yankee
fan
who
wants
to
see
the
best
yankee
team
id
take
snow
over
mattingly
at
first
the
yanks
also
gave
up
two
promising
propects
with
snow
for
abbott
besides
with
domingo
jean
brien
taylor
wickman
militello
and
sterling
hitchcock
they
are
just
loaded
with
propects
i
know
abbotts
only
but
this
was
too
much
to
give
up
i
believe
george
forced
this
trade
because
he
believes
and
hes
right
that
abbott
will
be
a
big
hit
in
ny
however
id
like
to
see
the
yankees
build
a
baseball
team
not
an
amusement
show
wade
boggs
i
live
in
boston
and
like
wade
a
lot
but
his
career
is
winding
down
and
i
would
rather
see
the
yanks
start
to
develop
a
long
term
solution
ie
hensley
muelins
russ
davis
velarde
besides
wade
just
doesnt
have
any
range
what
a
shame
about
charlie
hayes
huh
spike
owen
see
wade
boggs
id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
going
to
raise
the
yankee
staff
era
point
and
these
guys
are
on
the
down
sides
of
their
careers
danny
tartabull
yes
hes
put
up
some
tremendous
numbers
and
its
nice
to
think
about
what
he
could
do
if
he
were
ever
healthy
all
year
but
he
never
is
we
should
expect
games
max
out
of
him
meanwhile
gerald
williams
is
playing
at
columbus
and
paul
oneil
is
playing
left
field
i
believe
oneil
led
nl
outfielders
in
assists
last
year
and
tartabull
is
a
poor
defensive
outfielder
what
im
basically
getting
at
is
the
yanks
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
but
are
not
ready
to
win
a
pennent
this
year
they
should
at
the
gm
level
be
planning
for
a
or
world
series
this
means
getting
the
younger
players
experience
in
the
majors
now
so
they
will
be
ready
in
a
year
or
two
im
afraid
that
all
this
stuff
wreaks
of
george
steinbrenner
certainly
the
boggs
deal
was
all
george
it
looks
like
george
is
planning
the
right
mix
of
veterans
and
young
players
to
win
a
world
series
now
the
veterans
are
always
available
and
can
be
added
at
any
time
like
boston
did
this
year
develop
the
young
players
first
then
add
the
one
or
two
veterans
or
in
the
yankees
case
just
keep
them
lets
all
us
yankee
fans
hope
that
george
doesnt
dismantle
the
terrific
job
stick
and
company
have
done
building
the
yankee
organization
back
into
one
of
respect
im
really
afraid
that
he
will
trade
whoever
it
takes
to
patch
holes
today
relief
pitching
for
example
george
must
realize
that
the
yankees
rebuilding
process
is
still
one
or
two
years
away
have
patience
george
and
we
will
all
enjoy
the
future

on

since
i
discovered
how
to
use

and
both
times
i
received
redicule
for
predicting
the

as
high
as

in

id
like
to
hear
why
it
is
people
dont
think
the
sox
can
be
as
high
as
third
this
year
here
are
some
of
my
observations
well
had
you
been
a
bit
less
exuberant
in
both
the
tone
and
substance
of
your
predictions
the
responses
would
probably
have
been
a
bit
more
measured
be
that
as
it
may
roger
and
frank
are
in
vintage
form
and
the
sox
are
rresponding
to
them
clemens
is
always
in
this
form
and
viola
isnt
really
performing
beyond
what
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
how
do
you
know
that
the
sox
are
responding
to
them
and
not
to
al
bumbry
hobson
or
my
most
likely
suspect
new
hitting
coach
mike
easler
i
certainly
am
more
likely
to
give
easler
credit
for
mo
vaughhns
hot
start
than
clemens
or
viola
greenwell
is
hitting
as
he
did
before
his
injuries
this
was
the
optimistic
scenario
but
not
unreasonably
so
he
hasnt
shown
much
power
yet
though
dawson
is
providing
the
leadership
and
some
hitting
they
need
from
him
how
can
you
tell
that
dawson
is
providing
the
leadership
perhaps
its
calderon
perhaps
its
clemens
and
viola
maybe
hobson
is
finally
showing
those
people
skills
he
was
supposed
to
have
when
they
hired
him
or
maybe
its
all
a
myth
and
dawson
has
been
hitting
reasonably
well
but
not
as
well
as
greenwell
vaughn
cooper
or
fletcher
russell
is
finishing
well
in
three
games
why
dont
we
look
at
this
one
again
in
say
july
fletcher
is
hitting
well
as
a
leadoff
hitter
a
bit
better
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
but
dont
forget
that
zupcic
looked
like
wade
boggs
lite
for
about
abs
last
year
beware
of
small
sample
sizes
still
if
fletcher
hits
as
well
as
he
did
last
year
hed
be
a
great
improvement
over
any
sox
leadoff
hitter
from
last
year
be
aware
that
his
career
numbers
seem
to
indicate
that
he
puts
up
good
numbers
as
long
as
he
doesnt
have
to
make
more
than
ab
or
so
in
a
year
cooper
is
hitting
well
i
think
hell
be
better
then
boggs
in
the
field
and
just
as
good
at
the
plate
ummmsorry
no
i
can
buy
the
in
the
field
part
and
i
think
hell
be
better
at
the
plate
than
the
boggs
but
in
general
cooper
while
hell
be
a
pretty
good
hitter
couldnt
carry
boggs
jockstrap
with
a
little
luck
he
could
be
the
fourth
or
fifth
best
in
the
al
martinez
boggs
ventura
and
palmer
will
all
be
better
if
the
sox
pitch
like
last
year
they
have
a
better
pitchiong
staff
now
and
hit
like
they
are
so
far
they
coiuld
run
away
with
thee
division
but
since
i
think
that
their
hitting
and
pitching
may
not
be
up
to
the
challenge
of
running
away
with
the
division
i
think
that
they
win
be
over
and
at
least
third
if
not
second
or
first
see
here
is
where
you
make
that
quick
left
turn
off
into
the
aether
is
plausible
third
is
not
unlikely
but
phrases
like
could
run
away
with
the
division
are
likely
to
get
you
a
visit
from
the
men
in
the
white
coats
its
not
really
clear
that
their
staff
is
better
than
last
year
if
russell
does
well
darwin
doesnt
go
on
the
dl
and
hesketh
doesnt
pitch
just
barely
well
enough
to
avoid
losing
his
spot
in
the
rotation
they
could
be
better
on
the
other
hand
if
hesketh
pitches
miserably
and
theyre
too
stupid
to
move
him
to
the
pen
and
bring
up
conroy
or
somebody
fossas
continues
to
pitch
dismally
but
they
keep
giving
him
innings
becasue
hes
a
lefty
and
russell
explodes
they
could
be
pretty
bad

what

when
the

money

up

will
be
seeking
to
supplant
the
lost

from
alternative
sources
one
of
the
best
sources
may
be
ticket
sales
example
the
dodgers
the
dodgers
can
count
on
a
strong
base
of
season
ticket
sales
and
probably
believe
that
they
have
the
ability
to
raise

without

i
certainly
think
that
is
true
example
the
padres
they
will
be
lucky
to
average
fans
a
game
this
year
if
they
raise
prices
less
if
they
want
to
increase
their
overall
revenue
base
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
put
a
winning
team
on
the
field
but
given
that
wont
happen
it
wont
they
can
probably
make
more
money
by
lowering
ticket
prices
and
running
frequent
promotions
will
they
do
that
i
have
no
idea
but
they
wont
increase
prices
because
it
wont
work
for
them
even
assuming
that
you
have
some
strange
power
to
make
the
owners
decrease
ticket
prices
that
does
not
decrease
the
tv
contract
the
only
strange
powers
at
work
here
are
the
forces
of
the
market
place
each
teams
market
is
somewhat
different
and
each
owner
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
about
how
to
deal
with
those
market
forces
as
a

i

hmmm
i

either
my

rbi
might
not

a

nothing
is
and
no

tell

there
are

maybe
no

i
just

why
would
you
want

use
rbi
rbi
is
an
attempt
to
measure
is
some
combination
of
clutch
hitting
and
power
hitting
if
you
believe
in
clutch
hitting
then
look
at
how
the
guy
hit
with
risp
if
you
want
to
see
how
good
of
a
slugger
he
is
then
look
at
his
slugging
average
in
terms
of
evaluating
players
rbi
totals
are
better
than
nothing
but
why
use
them
when
so
many
better

are

for
a

which
i
know
from
nothing

which
sounds

she
said
that
among
other
things
berg
was
the
principal
spy
for
the
oss
cias
wwii
precursor
spying
on
axis
atomic
programs
because
of
his
physics
background
and
language
skills
she
said
that
during
the
war
he
met
with
heisenberg
in
switzerland
and
had
instructions
to
shoot
heisenberg
if
the
germans
were
close
to
us
in
bomb
research
he
concluded
they
were
two
years
behind
and
didnt
shoot
him
i
have
heard
elsewhere
that
heisenberg
deliberately
misled
the
nazi
bomb
program
but
i
dont
know
how
reliable
this
is
unfortunately

didnt

certainly
buy

berg
was
a

catcher
he
was
a
member
of
an
mlb
allstar
team
that
toured
japan
in

not
because

because

get

i

also
that

what

i

i
have

i
dont

a

that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
games
are
longer
now
for
several
reasons
more
pitching
changes
more
basestealing
and
throws

first
etci
think
a
very
small
factor
is
the
increased

it
takes
jose
canseco
deion
sanders
insert

ballplayer
here
to
arrange
their

prior
to
stepping
in
the
batters
box
my
impression
is
that
sportcasters
and
writers
have
made
this
an
issue
because
they
like
shorter
games
they
get
to
head
back
to
hotel
bar
eat
steaks
get
drunk
tell
stupid
jokes
with
their
pals
and
chase
stewardesses
around
the
bar
sure
they
want
the
game
over
with
print
journalists
have
a
slightly
more
legitimate
reason
for
wanting
faster
games
they
have
deadlines
the
espn
guys
on

tonight
drive
me
crazy
they
constantly
harp
on
this
primarily
because
they
often
have
to
work
late
when
the

goes
longer
than
maybe
i
am
just
a
neerdowell
with
nothing
better

but
i
would
like
to
hear
reasons
why
the
longer
games
upset
you
as
a
parenthetical
note
it
seems
the
league
is
in
any
case
fighting
a
losing
battle
this
year
the
increased
offense
thus
far
will
certainly
spoil
any
hopes
of
getting

and
finally
id
like
to
point
out
that
many
high
obp
guys
draw
their
walks
more
because
pitchers
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
because
they
have
a
great
eye
this
comes
up
periodically
and
i
just
dont
get
it
take
for
example
mark
mcgwire
he
walked
times
in
if
thats
not
a
potential
great
example
of
what
youre
talking
about
then
i
dont
know
what
is
now
lets
look
at
what
happens
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
single
of
the
time
he
hit
a
double
of
the
time
he
hit
a
homer
now
youre
pitching
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walks
for
homers
double
singles
and
outs
i
would
why
give
him
the
base
when
you
can
get
him
out
times
out
of
then
there
are
guys
like
alex
cole
who
has
a
career
obp
even
though
hes
never
had
a
batting
average
over
he
did
hit
in
ab
in
or
hit
a
single
home
run
yep
thats
right
hes
never
hit
a
homer
in
abs
through
the

of
whod
be

last

we
can
use
these
as
a
springboard
for
reconsideration
of
the
mvp
award
major
caveats
these
numbers
include
no
defensive
park
adjustment
so
if
san
diego
really
is
just
a
question
of
odd
scoring
or
gopher
holes
in
the
infield
that
will
cause
some
inaccuracies
the
offensive
numbers
are
positionadjusted
but
not
park
adjusted
so
we
have
to
deflate
some
and
inflate
others
to
be
fair
finally
we
still
dont

a

you

had

been
his

self
it
wouldnt

that
apparently
wasnt

darren

i

id

time
arguing

at

point
yes
i
know
these

are
only
approximate
but
thats
a
big
gap

him
and
the

also
those
of
you
who
thought
rickey

are
out

once

favor

contribution
which
should
have
a
higher
leverage
in

an

lots

first
a

in

way
suggests
more
baseball
to

unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by

that
the

before
folks
jump
on
me
let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jays
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
yes
morris
is
crapping
out
big
time
this
year
but
lets
not
change
history
to
suit
the
present
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrassing
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
his
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrassed
from
where
i
sit
ill
let
others
have
the
excellent
players
ill
settle

i
dont

the

at
all
for
telling
the

to
pitch
the
worst
part
of
the
whole

was
the

coming
out

the
field
what
were
they
going

the
only
people
who
shouldve
been
out
there
were

maybe
the

no

agree
with

that
hed

had

beef
about
the
pitch
that
was
called
a
strike
a
reasonable
umpire
would
not
have
tried
to
force
gant
back
into

in
that
situation
a
reasonable
umpire
would
do
as
hes
been
instructed
to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in

box
sooner
to
try
to
cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length
of
games
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
happen
and
hope
more
umpires
will
do
as
hirschbeck
did
in
instructing
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
while
i
can
see
why
they
want
to
cut
down
on
the
time
spent
walking
around
gant
wasnt
ordered
back
in
the
box
sooner
he
was
ordered
back
immediately
as
soon
as
he
stepped
out
hirschbeck
told
him
to
get
back
in
the
box
now
gant
doesnt
take
a
lot
of
walks
between
pitches
the
only
reason
he
did
then
because
he
was
very
bothered
by
the
call
i
expect
his
concentration
wasnt
there
yet
and
in
a
crucial
situation
i
imagine
its
best
to
be
as
calm
as
possible
contributing
factors
would
be
gants
bad
day
at
the
plate
bad
year
at
the
plate
and
the
braves
long
scoring
drought
now
its
pretty
stupid
to
go
ahead
and
talk
the
walk
when
the
umpire
is
telling
you
to
get
in
there
you
know
the
umpire
is
going
to
do
something
call
for
a
strike
throw
you
out
etc
gant
was
wrong
but
hirschbeck
was
more
wrong
in
my
biased
view
aside
from
the
major
chip
he
seemed
to
have
on
his
shoulder
what
was
the
problem
gant
had
a
reason
to
want
some
time
disputed
strike
call
gant
hadnt
been
wasting
time
all
game
the
game
had
been
cruising
along
and
was
just
over
two
hours
old
the
score
was
with
outs
in
the
ninth
and
a
runner
in
scoring
position
is
there
any
reason
hirschbeck
couldnt
and
shouldnt
cut
gant
a
little
slack
for
no
discernible
constructive
reason
hirschbeck
disrupted
the
game
caused
a
five
minute
delay
and
materially
hurt
the
batter
in
a
key
situation
did
he
have
a
date
to

tim

the
way
i

doing
it
was
a
little
different
being
me
of
course
i
used
equivalent

to
work
out
how
many
runs
a
player
was
worth
and
i
calculated
both
rate
of
performance
fielding
equivalent
average
and
total
performance
fielding
equivalent
runs
but
i
compared
not
to
the
average
player
but
the
replacement
player
and
heres
why
because
the
positional
adjustment
comes
built
in
to
the
system
in
the
al
of
the
average
ss
is
runs
above
replacement
rar
cf
lf

we
may
quibble
with
the
exact
numbers
but
the
order
looks
substantially
right
in
the
equivalent
average
i
have
always
set
league
average
to
i
had
decided
in
hitting
that
the
replacement
level
batter
has
an
eqa
of
the
name
of
that
replacement
level
hitter
often
as
not
is
billy
ripken
i
decided
to
let
the
replacement
level
fielder
be
the
same
distance
from
as
but
in
the
opposite
direction
as
i
have
set
it
up
that
makes
for
an
eqa
of
yes
i
can
add
runs
are
proportional
to
eqa
squared
the
difference
between
squared
and
squared
equals
the
difference
to
squared
and
i
rounded
off
for
simplicity
an

this
comes
up
periodically

i
just

for

mark

times

if
thats

great
example
of
what
youre

then
i
dont

what
is
now
lets
look
at
what
happens
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
single
of
the
time
he
hit
a
double
of
the
time
he
hit
a
homer
now
youre
pitching
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walks
for
homers
double
singles
and
outs
i
would
why
give
him
the
base
when
you
can
get
him
out
times
out
of
i
didnt
say
that
pitchers
fear
of
throwing
strikes
to
guys
like
mcgwire
bonds
and
frank
thomas
was
rational
i
just
said
that
it

there
are
guys
like
alex
cole
who
has
a
career
obp
even
though
hes
never
had
a
batting
average
over
he
did
hit
in
ab
in
or
hit
a
single
home
run
yep
thats
right
hes
never
hit
a
homer
in
abs
through
the
end
of
whod
be
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
him
i
dont
know
alex
coles
batting
style
at
all
some
questions
how
tall
is
he
does
he
go
into
a
crouch
like
rickey
hedersonpete
rose
does
he
foul
off
a
lot
of
pitches
like
brett
butler
does
he
take
or
strikes
in
each
at
bat
it
could
be
the
cole
has

i
think
we
all
agree
that
singles
hitters
should
take
a
strike
or
two
and
try
to
get
on

any
way
they
can
so
the

how
could

leave

would
these

have
a

if

pitches
perhaps
but
i
doubt
it
if
you
tell
joe
carter
to
go
up
there
and
take
a
few
pitches
he
will
draw
more
walks
but
he
also
wont
hit
as
many
frozen
ropes
into
the

he
is
more
likely
to
hold

the

would
do
better
in
my
opinion
by
just
coming
after
them
with
a
good
fastball
for
a
strike
on
the

but

in

umpires
judgment
interferes
with
the

taking
the

the
key
word
in
the
rule
is
and
a
runner
isnt
out
just
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the
ball
or
throw
or
fielding
of
the
throw
to
first
because
the
catcher
opted
to
throw
the
ball
over
the
batterrunners
head
theres
no
inter
ference
so
what
is
your
definition
of
interfering
with
the
fielder
taking
the
throw
the
rule
book
certainly
doesnt
have
a
definiton
or
clarification
so
its
possible
to
interpret
the
rule
as
saying
that
if
the
catcher
has
to
alter
his
throw
to
avoid
hitting
the
batterrunner
then
again
we
have
interference
you
know
it
seems
that
there
is
no
way
to
apply
this
rule
justlyif
the
catcher
or
the
pitcher
say
rob
dibble
for
example
throws
toward
first
and
hits
the
runner
running
inside
the
baseline
the
fielder
takes
the
chance
of
being
ejected
therefore
he
probably
would
throw
around
the
runner
or
your
scenario
above
him
you
should
note
that
in
our
american
legion

me
ask

would
the

have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
a
guy
who
threw
innings
with
about
run
lower
era
would
have
saved
the
bullpen
even
more
say
somebody
like
frank
viola
innings
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that

hi
there

german
and
i
have
been
into
this
mlb
stuff
since
almost
one
year
now
there
are
many
problems
occuring
for
me
one
of
them
is
the
era
statistic
for
pitchers
what
does
it
say
era
indicates
the
average
number
of
earned
runs
attributed
to
a
pitcher
per
nine
inning
game
thus
if
a
pitcher
pitched
innings
and
gave
up
earned
run
his
inning
equivelent
perfomance
would
be
earned
runs
thus
his
era
is
to
compute
the
era
you
simply
take
the
number
of
earned
runs
divided
by
the
innings
pitched
and
then
multiple
the
result
by
era
erip
an
earned
run
is
run
that
is
given
up
by
the
pitcher
that
is
not
attributed
to
a
fielding
error
more
specifically
if
an
error
occurs
that
represented
the
third
out
all
runs
scored
after
the
error
are
considered
unearned
runs
earned
runs
are
also
runs
scored
as
a
result
of
players
who
were
left
on
base
when
the
pitcher
exited
the
game
here
are
some
examples
if
there
are
two
outs
in
an
inning
and
there
are
men
on
base
if
an
error
occurs
that
represents
the
third
out
all
of
the
runs
after
this
error
and
not
counted
as
earned
runs
if
a
pitcher
issues
some
base
on
balls
walks
and
leaves
the
game
before
the
inning
is
completed
he
is
responsible
for
the
people
who
were
left
on
base
if
the
those
runners
who
were
left
on
base
score
and
the
score
was
not
a
result
of
an
error
those
eraned
runs
are
attributed
to
the
pitcher
who
left

was

some

they
said

anyone
remember
this
jody
mcdonnel
on

in
phil
has
been
saying
that
a
pitch
clock
was
inevitable
how
would
a
pitch
clock
work
on
throws
to
first
maybe
we
could
limit
the
number
of
throws
to
first
that
the
pitcher
can
make
and
award
a
balk
if
he
exceeds
it
id
have
another
question
who
would
operate
the
pitch
clock
one
of
the
umpires
add
another
one
to
the
crew
another
pair
of
suggestions
remove
the
balk
rule
it
is
the
runners
responsibility
to
stay
safe
no
matter
what
the
pitcher
does
im
not
sure
i
like
this
idea
i
think
it
would
severely
diminish
the
number
of
stolen
bases
and
limit
the
availability
of
such
neat
strategic
ploys
as
the
hit
and
run
and
the
squeeze
play
one
of
my
personal
favorites
if
a
pitcher
throws
to
an
occupied
base
more
than
x
time
x
to
without
successfully
picking
off
the
runner
the
runner
advances
a
base
as
if
walked
ahhh
i
suppose
i
should
read
the
whole
article
before
i
hit
the
f
key
eh
obviously
from
what
i
wrote
above
i
like
this
idea
the
nobalk
seems
to
give
the
pitcher
the
advantage
the
basewalk
allows
the
runner
to
challenge
pitcher
to
throw
over
to
the
base
it
may
also
increase
the
number
of
wild
throws
to
the
bag
since
the
pitcher
knows
he
doesnt
have
very
many
chances
to
pick
off
the
runner
so
he
may
hurry
too
much
id
rather
see
runs
scored
as
the
result
of
sound
hitting
and
sound
baseball
strategy
rather
than
on
the
sloppiness
that
could
result
from
this
kind
of
rule
so
i
suppose
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
that
idea
too
baseball

bothered

the

his

i

to
be

calm
as
possible

factors
would
be
gants
bad
day
at

bad
year
at

the

long

drought
and
it
is
not
hirschbecks
job
to
help
gant
with
any
of
these
difficulties
if
gant
cant
gather
his
concentration
for
whatever
reason
that
just
makes
him
all
the
more
meat
in
the
batters
box
the
umpires
job
is
to
maintain
flow
of
play
gant
is
not
entitled
to
time
to
regather
his
faculties
nor
is
anyone
else
now
its
pretty
stupid
to
go
ahead
and
talk
the
walk
when
the
umpire
is
telling
you
to
get
in
there
you
know
the
umpire
is
going
to
do
something
call
for
a
strike
throw
you
out
etc
gant
was
wrong
absolutely
i
think
itd
be
more
accurate
to
say
gant
was
foolish
but
hirschbeck
was
more
wrong
in
my
biased
view
aside
from
the
major
chip
he
seemed
to
have
on
his
shoulder
what
was
the
problem
gant
had
a
reason
to
want
some
time
disputed
strike
call
if
a
disputed
strike
call
is
ample
reason
for
a
timeout
games
would
last
about
ninefifteen
weeks
if
jack
morris
or
dave
whiner
stieb
were
pitching
a
disputed
strike
call
is
not
sufficient
for
a
time
out
suck
it
up
get
back
in
the
box
and
never
badmouth
the
blue
theyre
not
going
to
change
their
mind
and
youre
just
going
to
come
across
as
a
pinhead
which
wont
help
you
with
the
borderline
calls
ftr
i
never
speak
to
umpires
when
i
dont
know
them
personally
nor
do
i
glance
at
them
or
react
to
calls
as
a
result
i
think
i
get
more
than
my
fair
share
of
borderline
calls
at
the
plate
because
i
have
a
rep
of
having
a
good
eye
actually
there
are
a
lot
of
negative
connotations
that
go
with
that
rep
including
copious
questions
about
my
masculinity
party
affiliation
and
sexual
preference
gant
hadnt
been
wasting
time
all
game
the
game
had
been
cruising
along
and
was
just
over
two
hours
old
irrelevant
he
was
wasting
time
then
the
score
was
with
outs
in
the
ninth
and
a
runner
in
scoring
position
is
there
any
reason
hirschbeck
couldnt
and
shouldnt
cut
gant
a
little
slack
because
its
not
his
job
because
setting
the
precedent
of
cutting
slack
there
can
easily
extend

kind

i
agree
with
nick
whats
the
big
deal
about
long
games
if
you
want
to
watch
baseball
theres
that
much
more
baseball
to
watch
and
yes
baseball
includes
the
space
between
plays
as
well
as
the
plays
themselves
first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggests
more
baseball
to
watch
unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by
managers
and
pitching
coaches
until
six
or
seven
years
ago
i
was
an
enthusiastic
fan
of
nfl
football
last
year
i
hardly
watched
a
game
what
turned
me
off
were
the
incessant
interruptions
to
the
continuity
of
the
game
a
team
scores
minutes
of
commercials
kickoff
minutes
of
commercials
three
downs
and
a
punt
minutes
of
commercials
aaaaarrrrgh
earlier
in
this
thread
i
commented
on
larussa
and
the
as
whom
i
believe
institutionalize
slow
play
i
dont
mind
the
catandmouse
game
with
rickey
on
first
in
fact
i
rather
enjoy
it
similarly
i
would
enjoy
the
battle
with
listach
or
lofton
or
polonia
on
first
what
i
object
to
is
when
such
games
are
played
with
karkovice
on
first
or
when
the
game
is
a
blowout
i
dont
mind
when
the
pitcher
steps
off
the
mound
to
gather
his
thoughts
in
a
crucial
situation
or
when
a
hitter
steps
out
of
the
box
to
regain
his
concentration
what
i
object
to
is
when
hitters
and
pitchers
take
such
breaks
at
every
opportunity
when
a
game
is
exciting
these
little
delays
serve
as
tension
builders
and
for
me
enhance
the
value
of
the
experience
of
the
game
when
the
delays
happen
with
regularity
they
become
nuisances
just
like
the
commercial
breaks
in
football
i
understand
the
nfl
imposed
a
number
of
rule
changes
to
speed
up
the
games
basically
putting
an
onus
on
the
officiating
staff
to
move
the
markers
and
the
ball
to
the
spots
faster
that
did
not
address
the
problem
of
the
continuity
of
the
game
it
may
have
appeased
the
sponsors
and
the
networks
but
i
would
be
amazed
if
it
did
anything
to
enhance
the
experience
of
the
fans
similary
while
some
baseball
games
bore
me
to
tears
those
are
the
ones
where
there
is
no
continuity
and
the
players
are
taking
exasperatingly
long
periods
to
get
ready
for
each
pitch
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
the
bravesgiants
game
cared
about
gant
stepping
out
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
that
game
would
have
found
that
pause
to
be
anything
but
an
opportunity
to
have
their
complete
attention
claimed
by
the
drama
that
was
present
i
would
be
totally
opposed
to
any
effort
that
would
eliminate
that
aspect
of
baseball
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
baseball
had
a
commissioner
that
was
powerful
enough
to
sit
down
with
aldersonlarussaduncan
and
explain
that
they
are
actually
hurting
the
product
of
baseball
by
dragging
their
games
out
the
way
that
they
do
i
sure
wouldnt
mind

little
armtwisting

it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
i
dont
buy
this
at
all
i
think
things
are
colored
to
a
very
large
degree
of
preconceived
notions
of
who
the
players
involved
are
try
this
exercise
xxx
is
pitching
today
his
team
scores
in
the
first
inning
and
in
the
fourth
xxx
gives
up
in
the
through
in
the
fifth
he
gives
up
runs
in
the
he
gives
up
more
the
score
is
now
with
xxxs
team
still
on
top
i
contend
that
if
xxx
were
jack
morris
the
assessment
would
be
he
is
a
gutty
veteran
who
pitches
only
as
well
as
he
has
to
to
win
if
xxx
were
mike
trmbley
the
assessment
would
be
he
is
an
inexperienced
rookie
who
doesnt
know
how
to
pitch
needs
more
seasoning
send
him
to
aaa

to
the

in
viola

i
didnt

either
i
was

you

my

of
rumors
that
morris
was
coming
to
the
red
sox
they
ended
up
with
viola
instead
now
im
even
happier
viola
seems
to
have
rebounded
nicely
also
morris
was
willing
to
sign
for
only
two
years
the
jays
dont
like
to
sign
pitchers
to
longterm
contracts
which
i
think
is
a
sensible
policy
how
long
did
viola
sign
for
three
years
i
generally
agree
with
their
policy
of
avoiding
longterm
contracts
for
pitchers
but
i
think
they
enforce
it
rather
too
strictly
these
days
the
premier
pitchers
all
sign
three
or
four
year
deals
which
leaves
the
jays
with
morris
and
stewart
if
the
jays
want
to
compete
for
top
free
agent
pitchers
they
will
have
to
accept
greater
risks
any
idea
what
the
option

is

are

another

remove

it
is
the

responsibility
to

no

what
the

does
if
a
pitcher
throws
to
an
occupied
base
more
than
x
time
x
to
without
successfully
picking
off
the
runner
the
runner
advances
a
base
as
if
walked
this
last
suggestion
will
probably
increase
the
number
of
stolen
bases
considerably
suppose
the
pitcher
uses
up
of
his
n
pickoff
attempts
the
runner
can
probably
stretch
his
lead
off
the
base
given
that
there
will
be
extra
pressure
on
the
pitcher
to
get
it
right
this

would
this

apply
to
pickoff
attempts
per

per

what

you
can

his

fine
are
you
willing

bet
that
he
will
bat
the
rest
of
the
way
the
point
is
that
he
has
hurt
the
rockies
so
far
its
that
he
will
hurt
them
eventually
just
as
much
as
he
hurt
the
expos
and
the
cardinals
the
past
couple
seasons
if
it
happens
that
the
pitchers
start
throwing
him
fewer
good
pitches
and
he
starts
making
lots
of
outs
as
someone
speculated
might
happen
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that
he
isnt
taking
enough
pitches
my
comment
it
has
happened
for
the
past
seasons
where
have
you
been
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
license
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
and
make
outs
its
more
along
the
lines
of
hes
batting
and
leading
the
league
in
rbis
so
what
bloody
difference
does
it
make
if
he
isnt
drawing
a
lot
of
walks
sheesh

come

this

off
as
a

unbiased
assesment
of
wfan
and
wipi
go
to
school
in
philadelphia
and
i
listen
to
both
stations
on
a
consistant
basis
now
that
the
fan
has
mike
lupica
on
from
to
noon
they
have
a
person
who
can
get
the
big
name
guests
for
interviews
and
not
just
of
local
importance
he
did
have
dave
cheketts
and
fred
wilpon
on
his
show
but
he
had
bob
costas
and
magic
johnson
on
too
now
here
are
my
opinions
of
the
two
stations
competing
talent
morning
show
in
my
opinion
i
think
imus
is
much
better
than
bruno
cataldi
and
morganti
even
though
i
would
feel
different
if
morganti
had
a
better
crew
of
people
to
work
with
to
me
wip
tries
to
copy
imus
but
make
it
all
sports
as
a
theme
in
terms
of
sports
imus
lacks
the
blanketing
of
the
airwaves
but
he
interjects
humor
and
politics
into
his
show
am
to
noon
i
think
chuck
cooperstein
and
lupica
are
equal
in
their
abilities
to
host
a
radio
show
but
i
think
chuck
has
the
advantage
over
lupica
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
caller
who
is
asking
about
who
the
local
team
is
going
to
draft
in
the
sixth
round
lupica
and
the
other
hosts
on
fan
get
better
interview
guests
but
i
heard
the
pd
of
wip
say
that
they
were
not
interested
in
interviews
with
celebrities
unless
it
was
a
major
story
i
would
consider
this
even
because
they
are
two
different
styles
of
host
noon
to
pm
at
this
point
i
would
have
to
give
a
big
advantage
to
jody
mcdonald
over
len
berman
because
lenny
has
only
been
on
for
a
couple
of
weeks
i
just
think
jm
has
the
ability
to
transcend
the
homer
mentality
of
the
philadelphia
fan
base
this
is
most
evident
when
the
igglesphiladelphia
spelling
play
the
cowboys
because
jm
is
a
huge
dallas
fan
where
else
can
you
have
people
call
up
and
predict
a
score
without
the
egging
of
the
hostsrewip
morning
guys
i
do
agree
that
jm
was
great
on
the
fan
weekend
overnight
and
i
miss
hearing
him
over
the
current
crop
of
rotating
hosts
i
feel
that
jm
is
the
best
sportstalk
host
on
either
station
by
a
good
margin
if
you
are
in
ny
and
you
cant
get
wip
jm
does
fill
in
on
the
weekends
sometimes
to
this
is
the
time
when
jm
goes
up
against
francesa
and
russofatso
and
froot
loops
and
i
become
the
most
divided
in
my
loyalties
mike
and
the
dog
are
very
entertaining
but
they
often
go
an
hour
or
so
without
calls
or
even
to
minutes
without
talking
about
sports
matd
do
get
great
guests
and
that
is
the
basis
for
their
show
so
it
is
like
the
to
debate
another
plus
is
the
appearances
by
mike
and
chris
on
imus
in
the
morning
which
are
often
hilarious
pm
to
pm
matd
go
up
against
fredericks
and
missanelli
i
like
mike
missanelli
but
i
just
cant
stomach
steve
fredericks
i
know
that
sf
came
from
philly
originally
but
when
he
was
at
the
fan
he
was
a
ny
homer
as
much
as
he
is
a
philly
homer
now
i
dont
listen
to
wip
much
after
pm
unless
there
is
a
game
on
that
night
but
you
will
see
later
for
the
reason
that
is
why
i
give
the
advantage
to
fan
pm
to
midnight
sm
are
on
wip
until
and
then
it
is
the
man
who
makes

the
time
seem

charges
of

g
cobb
this
man
is
so
grating
on

nerves
that
if
i
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
i
go
nutsi
know
that
is
biased
but
listen
to
his
show
on
fan
there
is
usually
a
game
on
knicks
rangers
mets
jets
or
st
johns
basketball
if
the
game
is

then
it
is
usually

third

leius

looks
good
too
bad
hes
moving
to
short
pagliarulo
mike
this
is
an
interesting
line
his
figure
was
slightly
below
average
his
was
pathetic
and
his
was
the
next
best
year
by
anybody
part
of
that
may
be
his
mobility
was
with
the
yankees
was
with
the
padres
who
appear
to
have
a
rotten
infield
was
with
the
twins
and
judging
by
leius
and
gaetti
the
metrodome
may
be
a
good
place
to
play
third
gaetti
gary
apologies
if
i
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
but
as
a
twins
fan
i
like
to
think
they
have
good
players
in
any
park
not
sure
if
i
remember
completely
or
not
but
i
think
gaetti
played
with
the
twins
in
for
the
world
series
and
again
in
note
thats
his
lowest
of
the
i
believe
the
next
or
at
least
the
last
two
were
played
with
the
angels
lots
of
factors
make
a
player
excell
i
hate
it
when
so
many
use

it
may
not
be
ideal

nice
to
comfortably
enjoy

and
football
even

love
it
how
all
of

are
blaming
the

success
on
a
weak
division
why
dont
we
look
at
the
record
of
the
teams
in
each
division
read
interdivisional
play
well
see
that
the
east
is
really
kicking
the
shit
out
of
the
west
i
know
it
is
early
but
that
is
all
we
have
to
go
on
atlanta
is
just
so
strong
with
their
ba
cincinnati
is
coming
off
a
sweep
at
veterans
stadium
in
philadelphia
and
houston
was
swept
in
its
first
three
games
by
the
phillies
in
the
astrodome
that
my
western
division
friends
shows
that
the
three
best
teams
in
your
division
may
not
be
as
strong
as
you
think
or
you
may
be
posting
this
way
too
early
and
be
eating
your
words
by
midseason
cmon
the
phillies
havent
proved
anything
yet
atlanta
was
similar
to
the
phils
years
ago
they
sucked
they
started
having
a
good
year
but
didnt
get
any
respect
until
they
actually
won
the
division
which
is
how
it
should
be
so
until
the
phils
at
least
have
a
good
year
not
just
a
good
weeks
they
wont
get
any
respect
either
btw
atlantas
ba
is
actually
a
compliment
to
how
good
the
braves
really
are
their
record
is
can
you
imagine
the
phils
record
if
they
were
batting
hahahaha
and
atlantas
hitting
will
improve
dramatically
no

steve
as
i
have
read
this
net
the
last
few
days
i
am
continually
amazed
at
the
pronouncements
of
baseball
prowess
by
many
individuals
especially
when
it
comes
down
to
saying
that
the
bosox
havent
a
prayer
as
a
long
time
red
sox
fan
i
will
simply
say
the
impossible
dream
year
for
those
of
you
with
short
memories
short
lives
or
both
to
be
a
red
sox
fan
is
to
continually
be
the
subject
of
abuse
and
criticism
from
those
who
only
follow
the
hot
team
this
statement
is
supported
based
on
the
increased
number
of
brave
woofers
out
on
the
net
a
true
fan
of
a
team
any
team
will
follow
that
team
through
the
good
years
as
well
as
the
lean
years
and
be
amply
rewarded
when
the
time
is
right
yeah
so
what
if
buckner
let
a
roller
go
through
his
legs
in
who
cares
if
clemens
told
cooley
to
go
piss
up
a
rope
and
promptly
earned
a
quick
shower
the
fact
is
they
were
one
of
the
best
teams
in
the
league
those
years
and
the
fans
supported
them
now
that
it
appears
that
they
are
on
lean
times
the
number
of
detracters
come
from
all
over
so
what
let
them
play
and
we
will
see
what
happens
come
september
the
red
sox
may
not
be
that
good
but
they
are
certainly
not
that
bad
either
and
they
do
have
a
chance
to
win
the
world
series
after
all
remember
the
mets
who
would
have
given
them
a

make

baltimore
lets
face
it
baseball
is
a
wonderful
game
and
is
far
more
unpredictable
than
football

basketball

rbi
risp
and
slg
off
and
on
over
the
last
several
months
threads
about
rbis
and
related
topics
have
gotten
me
to
thinking
about
how
well
we
can
predict
a
players
rbis
using
information
about
his
overall
performance
and
the
number
of
runners
in
scoring
position
risp
that
he
bats
with
in
the
model
bill
james
calculated
predicted
rbis
as
bases
home
runs
this
completely
ignores
the
context
which
was
all
that
could
do
since
context
was
unknown
to
it
so
i
thought
id
take
that
idea
as
a
starting
point
and
look
how
good
a
fit
to
the
data
you
get
by
comparing
rbihome
runs
to
slgrisp
ive
started
with
team
data
using
data
from
the
eliass
that
ive
picked
up
over
the
years
when
a
i
could
afford
them
and
b
i
could
stomach
the
thought
of
increasing
eliass
profits
that
gave
me
the
years
and
i
dont
have
team
rbis
for
or
i
could
add
that
year
if
you
run
a
simple
least
squares
fit
to
the
data
you
get
rbihome
runs
the
correlation
between
the
lhs
and
the
rhs
is
which
is
significant
at
a
ridiculously
high
level
so
i
feel
like
the
fit
is
good
at
the
team
level
ive
no
started
to
move
on
to
the
player
level
and
have
looked
at
players
will
clark
ozzie
smith
joe
carter
and
don
mattingly
i
hope
to
add
quite
a
few
more
during
my
copious
free
time
this
year
it
doesnt
do
too
badly
except
the
equation
underpredicts
the
low
hr
hitter
smith
which
may
be
a
fault
of
the
model
or
it
could
just
be
ozzie
the
results
rbihr

actual
predicted
carter
clark
mattly
smith
i
think
we
can
make
a
case
and
i
hope
to
make
it
stronger
that
rbis
can
be
predicted
simply
from
knowing
how
a
player
slugs
overall
and
how
many
men
are
in
scoring
position
when
he
comes

as

tonight
big
lee
smith

the

seem
to
be
hitting
in

clutch
even
though
they
have
had
a
few
games
with
lots
of
hits

not

hopefully
with
the

stress

hitting
in

the

give

well

that

baerga
had

is
little
different
than
a

were
talking

walks

seven

four

i
would

the

also
alomar
got
a

greater
boost

baerga
did

hmm
so
if
you
wanted

pick

youd
take
alomar
anywhere
else

youd

do

im

the

go

i

is
anywhere
near
as
talented
as
thomas
was

his
aa
season

nearly

was

wasnt

last

well
if
we

when

i

just

makes

think
that
i
missed
a

no
one
i
repeat
no

laughed
louder

did

one
of

hidden
game
is
titled
pitching
is
of
baseball
implying
that
fielding
is
how
do
they
determine
that
beats
me
its
been
a
long
long
time
since
i
read
it
this
was
my
opinion
the
stupidest
thing
in
the
hidden
game
the
argument
was
defense
or
runs
allowed
is
of
the
game
unearned
runs
amount
to
of
the
runs
allowed
earned
runs
since
unearned
runs
are
the
result
of
fielding
not
pitching
and
earned
runs
are
the
product
of
pitching
not
fielding
fielding
is
of
defense
and
pitching
is
of
defense
caombining
with
pitching
is
of
the
game
fielding
pete
is
usually
sharper
than
that
my
own
feel
is
that
fielding
is
in
the
of
defense
range
call
it
between
fielding
and
pitching
one
also
has
to
separate
offense
into
batting
and
baserunning
with
the
split
probably
somewhere
around
and
id
give
baserunning
a
little
more
credit
than
that
maybe
or
even
give
a
team
of
roberto
alomar
and
a
team
of
john
oleruds
identical
batting
stats
which
wouldnt
be
that
unreasonable
and
even
if
you
dont
let
roberto
steal
a
single
base
theyll
score
a
lot
more
than
the

going

way
back

stuff
was
hampered
by
the
fact
that
elias
would
not
give
access
to
their
stats
at
any
price
project
scoresheet
and
later
stats
were
founded
to
fill
this
void
you
can
call
stats
and
ask
them
for
a
report
on
just
about
anything
in
their
database
and
they
will
provide
it
for
a
price
of
course
or
you
could
just
log
into
their
online
system
and
look
at
the
data
yourself
having
attempted
to
pry
numbers
from
elias
in
the
past
football
not

they

anyway
the
point
of
my

if
you
missed
it
was
that
derek

was

because
he
was
basically
in
the
doghouse
with
cito
and
the
rest
of
the
team
one
incident
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
was
when
derek
bell
ran
back
out
on
to
the
feild
after
the
jays
had
won
the
division
and
all
the
players
were
back
in
the
clubhouse
bell
ran
around
the
field
with
his
arms
in
the
air
waving
a
big
towel
over
his
head
he
looked
like
a
big
jerk
especially
when
you
consider
he
did
not
contribute
much
to
the
team
over
the
whole
season
the
next
day
winfield
and
carter
somehow
got
the
keys
to
bells
jeep
and
brought
it
out
on
to
the
feild
before
the
game
started
the
stadium
announcer
said
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
draw
later
in
the
game
for
bells
jeep
bell
really
freaked
out
i
dont

bell
was

popular
after
that
i

that
jackson
might
be
trying
a
little
too
hard
right
now
hes
known
for
being

well
officially

so
why
and
how
did
they
receive
this
label
unoffically
but
without
a
doubt
americas
team
is
the
cubs
why
well
my
guess
is
because
america
loves
underdogs
every
year
no
matter
the
cubs
talent
or
the
predictions
they
never
as
close
to
never
as
possible
win
anything
over
the
years
as
the

mounted
america
has
fallen
in
love
with
these
perennial
losers
the
cubs
have
more
fans
in
chicago
then
some
teams
do
worldwide
the
cubs
have
more
fans
worldwide
than
most
of
the
teams
in
their
division
combined
an
aura
of
excitement
surrounds
the
cubs
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
like
no
one
else
including
the
ws
champs
it
must
be
that
eternal
hope
this
is
the
year
theyve
got
the
talent
theyre
off
to
a
good
start
theyve
got
the
pitching
or
hitting
or
whatever
their
strong
point
is
at
the
time
its
that
inevitability
that
the
cubs
will
eventually
win
the
ws
again
when
only
god
knows
since
its
been
so
long
it
could
come
at
any
time
or
it
could
be
another
years
but
until
they
do
finally
win

that

they
diserve

early
and
often
by
the
heavily
rightunbalanced

which
managed
some
recently
rare
power
with

belcher
was
solid
throughout
and
in

seemed
to
get
stronger
as
the
game
progressed
early
on
he
had
several
threeball
counts
but
even
those
were
few
and
far

later
on
as
he
allowed
only
one

while
striking
out
nine
in
a
post

interview
he
said
his
changeup
was
working
for
himi
should
say
so
all
nine
of
his
strikeouts
were
apparently
on
breaking

they
all
struck

kelly
managed
a
score
anyway
due

a

and
a
tomlin
wild
pitch
in
fact
it
appeared
that
tomlin
was
going
to
recover
nicely
from
his
shaky
start
he
retired
of
the
next
batters
to
get
to
the
fourth
behind
only
randy
milligan
though
had
different
ideas
as
his
lineshot
was
poorly
played
by
orlando
merced
and
turned
into
a
triple
milligan
would
later
score
on
reggie
sanders
sacrifice
fly
giving
cinci
the
lead
after
the
fifth

spelled
loss
for
tomlin

hirschbeck

gotten

tossed
altogether
but
if
hirschbeck

let

step
out
the
whole
incident
probably
would
have
been
avoided
my
impression
was
that
gant
was
not
stepping
out
he
was
making
a
protest
about
the
lack
of
an
appeal
to
first
as
has
been
pointed
out
earlier
there
is
no
appeal
to
first
on
a
strike
i
can
understand
gant
feeling
a
little
pressure
in
a
twoout
risp
game
ninth
inning
he
let
it
get
to
him
the
ump
also
overreacted
gant
was
stalking
off
but
i
doubt
he
would
have
been
gone
long
hirschbeck
should
have
let
him
have
a
moment
to
compose
himself
before
telling
him
to
come
bat
imho
umpires
should
be
more
flexible
than
what
hirschbeck
showed
gant
was
disturbed
to
the
point
it
was
pretty
likely
he

re
why
is
barry

not

definitely
the

imho
to
have
williams
a
streaky
hitter
and
not
really
a

hitter
batting
ahead
of

is
simply
an
injustice
to
the
giants
and
fans
of
the
giants
having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams
to
get
to

youre
definitely
correct
in
that
williams
absolutely
has
to
be
sandwiched
in
between
clark
and
bonds
he
must
and
i
mean
must
get
fastballs
to

he
becomes
little
more
than
sixto
lezcano
in

what
i
would
suggest
is
perhaps
batting
bonds
williams
and
clark
the
reason
being
that
i
feel
bonds
potential
basestealing
abilities
are
wasted
when
hes
stuck
behind
two
slow
runners
i
think
the
chance
of
getting
extra
stolen
bases

in
the
spot
would
more
than
offset
any

before
folks
jump
on
me
let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jays
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
well
when
you
say
without
morris
you
have
to
mention
an
assumed
replacement
if
the
alternative
to
morris
was
letting
cito
gaston
softtoss
the
ball
underhand
to
the
opposition
every
days
then
of
course
the
blue
jays
wouldnt
have
won
without
morris
if
the
alternative
was
replacement
level
then
i
think
it
wouldve
been
very
close
and
yes
morris
mightve
made
the
difference
if
the
alternative
was
frank
viola
the
blue
jays
probably
would
have
won
more
easily
with
viola
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
yes
you
can
make
the
argument
that
the
his
presence
prevented
the
team
from
collapsing
in
august
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
those
innings
were
probably
helpful
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
well
i
think
is
complete
bs
what
happened
most
of
the
time
is
that
morris
fell
behind
and
the
team
came
back
and
rescued
him
mostly
this
is
because
hes
a
lousy
inning
pitcher
and
much
better
the
rest
of
the
way
that
the
team
can
climb
out
of
holes
consistently
and
win
them
is
not
to
morris
credit
its
to
the
teams
credit
furthermore
while
morris
did
exceed
the
wl
percentage
that
would
be
projected
from
his
runs
allowed
and
run
support
he
hasnt
done
this
in
previous
years
in
fact
his
wl
record
in
is
a
lot
worse
than
what
it
projects
to
be
with
run
support
and
runs
allowed
do
you
think
he
just
came
up
with
this
ability
in
look
at
the
postseason
games
he
pitched
decently
in
typical
morris
games
morris
gets
behind
team
rescues
him
hes
not
responsible
for
that
rescue
and
in
both
those
games
the
team
just
didnt
rescue
him
enough
jack
morris
pitched
as
well
as
he
did
during
much
of
the
season
in
those
games
the
offense
just
didnt
earn
him
a
victory
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrassing
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
his
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrassed
morris
is
one
of
those
guys
who
will
reture
when
he
cant
start
anymore
hes
too
bad
a
first
inning
pitcher
to
serve
in

according

advanced
scouts
are
reporting
that
morris
fastball
and
slider
still
have
the

zip
and
that
his
problems
this
year
are
due
to
his
sudden
inability
to
keep
the
ball
hidden
during
his
release

and
stottlemyre

stretches
that
have

cleared
up

gammons
looks

morris
back
in

form
within
the
month
i
on
the
other
hand
still
have
my
doubts
morris
era
last
year
was
rather
high
for
a
pitcher
who
won
games
his
showing
in
the
series
was
not
surprising
although
im
not
convinced
that
hes
washed
up
i
have
my
doubts

to
whether
or
not

first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggests
more
baseball
to
watch
unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
i
definitely
do
thats
why
i
dont
like
going
to
see
games
played
on
artificial
turf
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by
managers
and
pitching
coaches
and
while
its
true
that
the
gaps
between
plays
can
be
interesting
this
is
only
true
when
they
dont
become
extralong
well
your
idea
of
interesting
differs
from
mine
i
think
batting
practice
is
interesting
for
example
and
make
a
special
effort
to
get
to
the
game
very
early
in
order
to
see
it
i
think
the
delaying
tactics
of
batters
pitchers
catchers
and
managers
are
interesting
because
theyre
attempts
to
gain
advantage
through
control
of
the
flow
and
timing
of
the
game
of
course
the
umpires
can
and
should
intervene
when
these
tactics
get
out
of
hand
as
ryan
robbins
has
pointed
out
there
are
rules
that
cover
this
one
of
the
more
fascinating
things
about
baseball
i
think
is
its
openendedness
with
regard
to
time
you
never
know
if
the
game
is
going
to
zip
right
by
and
be
over
in
less
than
two
hours
or
if
its
going
to
go
on
until
four
in
the
morning
likewise
some
games
are
actionpacked
and
some
games
are
slow
and
lazy
thats
fine
by
me
those
folks
who
want
constant
action
should
watch
the
games
on
tv
so
they
can
channel
surf
and
cater
to
their
short

bet
my
next
paycheck
that
of
the
socalled
braves
fans
living
outside
of
georgia
at
the
present
time
can
not
name
more
than
players
from
their
season
on
the
other
hand
ask
any
cubs
fan
living
anywhere
in
the
united
states
to
name
players
from
any
given
year
and
of
them
probably
could
you
could
be
right
then
again
you
could
be
wrong
this
claim
is
completely
unverifiable
and
untestable
id
wager
most
of
the
braves
fans
on
the
net
could
name
more
than
players
from
their
season
you
could
give
away
tickets
to
braves
games
however
my
dad
and
i
were
able
to
get
great
seats
from
scalper
for
face
value
which
isnt
exactly
the
sign
of
a
hot
ticket
granted
the
fact
that
a
team
wins
brings
people
to
the
ball
park
but
that
does
not
mean
they
diserve
the
title
americas
team
the
only
reason
they
are
considered
americas
team
is
because
of
ted
turner
and
his
little
tv
station
which
broadcasts
across
the
nation
this
is
precisely
why
they
were
considered
americas
team
even
especially
when
they
were
bad
you
could
see
most
of
the
braves
games
on
cable
you
could
do
that
for
the
cubs
as
well
but
the
braves
had
better
camerawork
better
announcers
what
would
you
rather
listen
to
harry
discuss
the
game
or
skip
and
pete
discuss
motoball
and
teams
that
werent
too
much
worse
because
of
tbs
the
braves
had
a
lot
of
fans
outside
of
georgia
at
home
in
kentucky
even
though
we
were
much
closer
to
cincinnati
there
was
as
many
braves
fans
as
reds
fans
even
in
you
could
actually
watch
the
braves
play
you
had
to
go
to
cincinnati
to
watch
the
reds
i
can
go
anywhere
in
america
and
watch
the
braves
ill
consider
toronto
americas
team
before
the
braves
why
id
guess
that
braves
fans
are
more
widely
distributed
than
toronto
fans

think
hes
all

his
season
last

was
good

im
not

dont

just
my
ho
tim

can

deion
can
be

learning
how
to
play
the
game
im
not
betting
that
deion
will
be
able
to
play
as
well
as
last
year
but
i
think
the
odds
of
deion
playing
as
well
or
better
than
he
did
last
year
are
better
than
the
odds
of
otis

doing

you
factor

otis
was

be

rbi
question
is
there
any
judgement
call
on
the
part
of
the
scorer
for
sac
fly
rbis
this
is
the
situation
that
brought
the
question
up
the
red
sox
were
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
by
a
score
of
the
mariners
had
the
bases
loaded
with
out
the
batter
hits
a
fly
to
center
which
the
fielder
catches
the
runner
at
third
tags
and
scores
without
a
throw
now
without
a
judgement
call
and
i
dont
think
there
is
one
this
is
an
rbi
for
the
batter
it
seems
to
me
that
a
better
name
for
this
would
be
defensive
indifference
since
it
doesnt
really
matter
whether
the
guy
at
third
scores
at
that
point
i
know
i
can
think
of
several
if
the
mariners
stole
third
and
second
which
opening
the
base
would
allow
and
then
the
batter
hit
a
grounder
which
the
third
baseman
gets
deep
in
the
hole
between
himself
and
third
he
wouldnt
have
a
play
at
home
third
or
second
for
the
out
and
maybe
he
therefore
cant
make
the
throw
to
first
to
get
the
last
out
etc
scenarios
too
but
does
it
really
matter
if
this
guy
scores
this
way
when
youre
down
by
if
the
tying
run
is
going
to
score
so
is
the
guy
on
third
the
point
is
that
the
batter
imo
shouldnt
get
credit
an
rbi
for
utterly
failing
to
do
his
job
which
at
this
point
is
to
get
a
hit
or
a
walk
not
trade
an
out
for
one
run

clark
barry

imho
to
have

not

batting

is
simply
an
injustice
to

reasons
batting

will
create

this

a

do
you
differentiate
hispanic

after
all
some

fall
into
both
categoriesrafael

is

sorry
about
that
but
miguel
dilone
would
qualify
if
i
remember
correctly
when
i
say
black
i
mean
usborn
black
people
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
hispanic
players
were
in
baseball
before
and
one
team
in
the
signed
lots
of
hispanics
because
they
went
over
better
with
the
local
audience
than
blacks
did
and
why
would
more
hispanics
stick
around
than
blacks
dont
know
but
remember
this
is
the
country
that
had
special
racial
laws
for
one
group
and
one
group
only
blacks
our
national
history
includes
huge
longterm
global
tensions
regarding
the
black
minority
the
hispanic
minority
while
often
discriminated
against
has
never
been
the
object
of
national
obsession
it
might
also
be
worth
your
while
to
subdivide
the
data
into
careers
starting
at
intervals
i
would
think
that
your
prediction
would
be
most
true
for
careers
starting
in
the
and
least
true
for
careers
starting
in
the
of
course
youd
also
have
to
compare
total
ml
racial
percentages
for
the
era
in
question
absolutely
as
i
said
before
i
expect
that
this
effect
is
disappearing
but
it
certainly
did
exist
and
all
out
talk
of
twgs
and
all
that
is
not
without
some
small
reason
im
of
the
opinion
that
your
point
is
less
valid
today
than
it
was
years
ago
but
i
would
be
curious
to
see
the
data
well
theres
the
list
go
for
it
ill
cull
some
more
names
as
i
go
i

youre

re

bonds

i
like
the
clarkwilliamsbonds
order
pitchers
can
only
walk
clark
with
outs
unlike
last
year
williams
is
getting
better
pitches
to
hit
with
bonds
looming
in
the
ondeck
circle
since
matt
has
a
terrible
batting
eye
this
helps
the
giants
a
lot
when
bonds
gets
on
base
all
by
himself
he
can
try
to
steal
and
then
be
driven
in
with
a
single
by
thompson
manwaring
or
clayton
if
you
bat
bonds
before
the
other
sluggers
then
you
dont
want
him
to
run
because
a
caught
stealing
could
take
you
out
of
a
big
inning
also
bonds
is
less
in
need
of
protection
behind
him
because
he
is
such
a
good
base
stealer
a
walk
is
a
potential
double
the
only
draw
back
is
when
clark
and
williams
are
clogging
up
the
bases
infront
of
bonds
and
i
think
thats
a
problem
the
giants
will
be
glad
to
see

he

can

on
earth
is
a
team
effort
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemens
contributes
to
a
ws
cham
pionship
more
than
morris
your
evaluation
of
clemens
is
totally
sub
jective
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to
see
that
any
of
you

with
any
greater
accuracy
than

after

must

that

you

because
i

you
are
quite
capable

using

you
dont

have

i

not

although
i

claimed

in

i
am

that
it
is
impossible
to
isolate
an

for
the
purpose
of
comparing

performance

in

you

fortunately

roger

would

to

you
theres
no

i
can

judge
the

to

or

you
see
there
are

on

we
have
no

the

committed

we
have
no

knowing
how
the

would

acted
had
he

because
living
on
this

is

and
no
individual
committs

totally
isolated

he

then
the

put

some

your

i
know
youre
another
longterm
braves
fan
about
playing
thats
the
most
difficult
position
to
field
after
catcher
at
ss
or
you
need
more
range
and
speed
but
at
youve
got
to
have
quick
reflexes
and
have
a
gun
for
an
arm
there
are
no
second
chances
at
even
when
playing
sandlot
softball
granted
id
still
put
my
best
overall
infielder
at
ss
but
thats
because
he
gets
more
chances
not
because
the
job
is
harder
it
still
amazes
me
that
so
many
teams
have
tried
to
convert
other
position
players
to
but
maybe
thats
because
the
supply
of
natural
is
scarce
finally
gant
is
a
player
who
puts
pressure
on
himself
to
perform
well

works

improve
you
dont

those
amazingly
huge
arms
on

relatively
small
body
without

work
now
whether
hes
been
overdoing
it
these

may
be
a
valid
question
as
is
the
question
of
whether
he
tries

hard

make
something
happen
during

frankly
if
a
player
is
going

not

up

id

they

at

a
hit
is
worth
about
if
hed

one
of
those
hits
called
an
error
and
one
taken
away
by
a
good
defensive
play
hed
be
in
the
range
if
he
goes
in
his
next
game
hes
all
the
way
down
to
in
one
game
come
back
in
june
lets
talk
then
if
it
happens
that
the
pitchers
start
throwing
him
fewer
good
pitches
and
he
starts
making
lots
of
outs
as
someone
speculated
might
happen
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that
he
isnt
taking
enough
pitches
my
comment
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
license
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
and
make
outs
its
more
along
the
lines
of
hes
batting
and
leading
the
league
in
rbis
so
what
bloody
difference
does
it
make
if
he
isnt
drawing
a
lot
of
walks
sheesh
its
history
greg
andres
history
is
that
he
doesnt
walk
much
because
he
swings
at
bad
pitches
so
his
average
isnt
very
good
abs
doesnt
mean
an
awful
lot
compared
to
a
history
of
a
couple
of
thousand
especially
when
theres
ample
evidence
bb
in
that
his
basic
hitting
approach
hasnt
changed
yeah
he
might
suddenly
have
turned
into
a
hitter
who
never
walks
but
dont
bet
the
rent
money

it

hey
folks
saw
the
giants
play
ball
at
the

saturday
april
it
was
the
game
where
pendelton
broke
up
the
scoreless
tie
in
the
ninth
with
a
twoout
tworun
homer
to
right
to
win
it
it
wasnt
the
game
where
the
fans
threw
the
giveaway
fotoballs
onto
the
field
in
response
to
the
homer
too
bad
huh
well
the
stick
is
still
cold
the
saturday
game
ended
at
and
it
was
cold
then
i
cant
imagine

games
in
april
at

stick
the
wind
kicked
up
a
little
too
and
i
got
this
idea
at
most
games
theres
a
pile
of
hot
dog
wrappers
and
cups
and
trash
on
the
field
a
lot
of
the
time
i
propose
a
kids
cleanup
corps
composed
mainly
of
year
old
kids
who
would
love
nothing
better
than
to
run
out
on
the
field
in
the
fifth
inning
when
the
guy
in
the
toro
smooths
the
infield
and
grab
the
trash
it
might
not
be
glamorous
but
at
that
age
i
probably
would
have
given
anything
to
be
on
the
field

rather
they
showed
quite

that

has
never
been

im
sure
you
are
convinced
dave
apparently
so
is
tony

i
however
am
not
i
believe
at
the
time
of
the

appearance
that

bench
available
for

duty
over
the

ab

i
do
not
claim
that
this
is
a
complete
statistical
analysis
that
proves
the
existence
of
clutch
hitting
or
compelling
testimony
that
samuel
would
have
gotten
a
base
hit
im
sure
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
sample
size
or
that
the
basic
assumption
that
clutch
performance
is
random
invalidates
any
conclusions
from
this
limited
application
or
something
or
other
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
statistical
analysis
well
we
agree
on
the
last
part
one
of
the
basic
things
you
need
to
have
in
a
statistic
to
be
able
to
predict
a
players
performance
on
it
in
the
future
is
for
there
to
be
a
correlation
from
year
to
year
a
players
batting
average
is
correlated
fairly
well
from
year
to
year
a
players
ability
to
walk
or
infielders
defensive
average
are
correlated
better
that
is
to
say
given
their
past
performance
in
those
statistics
we
can
have
a
pretty
good
handle
on
how
theyll
do
next
year
put
in
some
simple
information
about
aging
and
you
can
do
even
better
one
of
the
basic
problems
with
something
like
clutch
batting
average
overall
batting
average
is
that
the
correlation
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
adding
to
the
sample
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
as
a
counterexample
to
what
you
showed
consider
the
following
two
players
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
players
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situations
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
before
you
accuse
me
of
completely
cooking
the
data
there
were
players
who
had
clutch
at
bats
every
year
from
according
to
elias
as
a
simple
measure
of
clutchness
lets
just
look
at
clutch
banonclutch
ba
if
you
use
to
predict
for
those
players
youd
find
that
of
the
were
below
league
average
in
that
measure
both
in
and
in
were
above
league
average
in
both
periods
and
the
other
were
above
in
one
and
below
in
the
other
if
you
were
just
flipping
coins
youd
expect
to
get
abovebelow
in
both
and
that
switched
the
difference
between
the
observed
results
and
the
coin
flip
experiment
is
not
statisically
significant
btw
correlating
players
overall
batting
average
from
with
gives
a
correlation
coefficient
of
which
is
significant
at
something
better
than
the
confidence
level
correlating
their
clutchnonclutch
ba
for
the
same
period
gives
a
correlation
of
significant
at
no
level
of
any
interest
everyone
would
agree
i
hope
that
a
grand
slam
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
when
your
team
is
down
by
three
is
a
very
clutch
hit
there
is
just
no
way
to
predict
who
is
more
likely
to
get
the
clutch
hit
based
on
past
performance
hitting
in
clutch
situations
if
you
say
so
dave
no
way
actually
its
technically
incorrect
to
say
that
we
cant
predict
future
clutch
performance

more
correct

suspect
that
a
comment
like
i
enjoy
hitting
fourth
im
used
to
it
would
get
pretty
brutally
misinterpreted
by
the
media
if
it
came
from
strawberry
russ
porter
quoted
strawberry
as
saying
i
feel
more
comfortable
hitting
cleanup
and
i
think
i
perform
best
in
that
role
paraphrased
by
my
memory
and
bias
that
seems
like
a
fairly
nonpetulant
answer
to
what
was
almost
certainly
a
question
like
how
do
you
feel
about
being
moved
to
the
third
spot
in
the
order
a
more
mediasensitive
player
might
answer
the
manager
knows
what
he
is
doing
if
he
thinks
that
batting
me
third
will
help
the
team
then
i
am
all
for
it
wed
ignore
that
answer
as
brown
stuff
so
it
seems
a
little
bit
of
an
overreaction
to
brand
darryls
response
as
petulant
personally
i
think
his
argument
is
nonsense
and
that
it
really
doesnt
matter
much
in
which
order
the
players
in
the
order
are
batted
except
for
personal
stats
if
i
were
darryl
id
probably
answer
that
question
the
number
four
spot
gets
a
few
more
rbi
opportunities
and
i
get
paid
for
rbis
i
think
it
is
best
for
me
to
bat
fourth
but
i
am
willing
to
hit
third
if
tommy
thinks
it
will
benefit
the
team
or
something
like
that
it
would
be
helpful
at
salary
timemy
rbis
were
down
because
i
was
hitting
thirdand
make
him
sound
like
a
team
player
since
strawberry
will
not
likely
go
through
arbitration
but
use
the
free
agent
market
for
his
next
contract
maybe
that
argument
is
useless
but
it
would
help
his
image
with
the
media
without
appearing
to
be
totally
contentfree
remember
the
media
is
of
the
belief
that
ones
best
rbi
man
should
hit
fourth
so
the
argument
is
sensible
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
true

been
answered
if
spanky
was
bad
enough
to
release
this
year
why
did
he
get
so
much
playing
time
last
year
yes
i
know
he
was
part
of
a
platoon
and
thats
why
he
got
more
playing
time
than
slaught
but
that
doesnt
answer
the
question
if
slaught
was
so
obviously
better
this
year
wasnt
this
also
obvious
last
year
and
shouldnt
he
have
been
taking
away
some
of
spankys

one

has
always

i
believe
the

also
does
not
deal
with
this
situation
however
if
the

is

at
what

can
a

legally
leave

fear
of

early
the

can
leave
his

any

if
the
ball
is
caught
hes
got
to
tag
up
if
it
isnt

he
doesnt
have
to
tag
up
at
all

if
hes
feeling
lucky
your
runner
at

can
sprint
for
glory
as
soon
as
the
ball
is
popped

hes
probably
scored
a

if
it
is
hes
probably

the
only
effect
the

is
to
make

removing

you

immediately
follow

with
numbers

had

the
only
category
that
i
see
which
shows
an
advantage
for
alomar
is
obp
well
obp
is
the
most
important
offensive
statistic

by
a

is
worth
considerably
more

still

baerga
was

better

i

this

a

youre

find
i
personally
dont
care
much
for
alomars
defense
i
dont

hes
nearly
as
good
as
people
make
him
out

be

he
cant
turn

save
his

he
comes
across

his

is

gerald
perry
of
the

pinch
hit
in
the
eighth
inning
with
two
on
and
his
club
down
by
a
run
he
stroked
a
line
drive
into
the
right
field
corner
the
ball
cleared
the
threefoot
high
fence
and
went
into
the
crowd
darryl
racing
over
from
right
center
got
to
the
spot
in
time
to
reach
his
glove
up
over
the
short
fence
but
he
missed
the
ball
a
fan
sitting
in
the
front
row
wearing
a
mitt
reached
up
and
caught
the
ball
home
run
now
ive
seen
the
replay
several
times
and
i
have
concluded
that
darryl
missed
the
ball
and
that
the
fans
glove
was
essentially
behind
darryls
several
dodger
fans
with
seats
in
the
immediate
vicinity
have
claimed
that
the
fan
unquestionably
interfered
with
strawberry
what
cannot
be
disputed
however
is
that
the
fan
who
caught
the
ball
never
took
his
eye
off
it
he
was
oblivious
to
where
the
fielder
was
playing
he
was
also
quite
exuberant
as
soon
as
he
realized
he
had
made
the
catch
stuff
about
daryl
and
tommy
and
everyone
blaming
fan
for
the
loss
deleted
i
saw
the
replay
several
times
too
no
question
about
it
daryl
missed
the
ball
then
the
fan
caught
it
daryl
is
so
tall
that
he
had
the
first
shot
at
the
ball
daryls
just
whining
again
i
think
it
shows
a
lack
of
class
when
tommy
daryl
and
the
dodgers
blame
a
single
fan
for
losing
the
game
what
about
the
pitcher
who
threw
up
the
gopher
ball
what
about
the

gave

runs

point

it
were

hes
very

particularly
clark
as

it

see

hit

so
well
im

if
barry
was
after
revenge
against
the

or
what
but
he
stroked
three
very
pretty
hits

for

the
giants
as
a
team
are
doing
a

of
surprising
things
this
year
in
addition
to
bonds
there
has
been
some
good
pitching
and
some

seem

be
swinging

i

thats

two

biggio

concerned

have
been

over

no

not

i

its

have

good
that
are

now
on

note
are
you
at
all
concerned
with
the
rumors
concerning
next

uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
traditional
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniforms
may
totally
eliminate
the
color
orange
shiver
mclanes
favorite
color
is
red
so
this
sounds
like
their
old
road
unis
pretty
dull
buttons
or
pullovers
ill
check
through
my
uniform
book
to
see
if
theyve
always
had
some
orange
im
really
upset
the
current
unforms
are
dull
and
the
new
ones
sound
horrible
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretty
but
houston
had
established
a
long
precident
of
wearing
the
ugliest
uniforms
in
baseball
and
i
liked
it
well
well
see
ive
got
a
astros
pullover
shirt
with
the
astros
stripes
across
the
shoulders
and
i
have
trouble
making
myself
wear
it
in
public
i
can
see
why
they
might
want
that
to
change
gee
if
they
eliminate
the
orange
will
they
reupholster
the
seats
in
the
astros
stripes
section
what
used
to
be
the
gold
and
yellow
levels
i
dont
know
those
numbers
they
use
now
i
saw
a
pinstripe
version

experience
long
ive
been
a
giants
season
ticket
holder
for
years
and
never
really
complained
about
the
old
ballyard
place
sure
its
been
cold
the
food
lines
were
long
and
the
hired
hands
were
surly
but
this
was
all
part
of
the
giants
mystique
or
so
i
thought
i
went
to
tuesdays
game
giants
over
the
marlins
and
the
stick
was
a
much
different
place
nothing
short
of
a
dome
will
eliminate
the
wind
but
everything
is
a
lot
better
the
lines
are
a
lot
shorter
the
bathrooms
are
clean
and
have
running
water
and
the
hired
hands
were
very
polite
the
new
foghorn
lights
up
and
blows
after
each
homerun
and
the
wooden
fence
are
very
nice
as
are
the
new
bleachers
the
bleachers
start
right
at
the
top
of
the
fence
and
give
a
great
view
and
theyve
got
beer
stands
at
the
bottome
of
the
bleachers
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
electronic
oldfashioned
scoreboard
looks
electronic
could
be
better
these
things
should
have
been
done
a
long
time
ago
but
it
took
a
real
businessman
ex
safeway
president
peter
magowan
to
figure
it
out
just
like
he
used
to
tell
his
checkers
if
the
customers
dont
come
back
i
dont
need
as
many
checkers
this
isnt
a
knock
on
bob
lurie
he
was
a
competent
businessman
but
he
didnt
deal
much
with
the
general
public
ill
give
an
example
of
how
the
level
of
service
has
changed
the
onion
dispenser
jammed
as
i
was
using
it
an
attendant
came
over
apoligized
for
the
problem
and
proceeded
to
fix
the
machine
after
he
was
done
he
cleaned
the
machine
and
said
he
was
glad
to
be
able
to
help
in
the
old
days
there
was
no
attendant
and
the
folks
at
the
concession
stands
would
say
go
to
the
stand
feet
away
they
might
be
able
to
help
all
in
all
it
was
a
fun

dropped

doesnt

like

an
item

the
austin

if
you
read
it
here
it
was
somewhere
else
first
said
that
he
wouldnt
take
injuries
as
an

for
losing
because
that
possibility
should
have
been
accounted
for
uh
oh
i
dont
want
an
owner
thatll
keep
everybody
on
edge
id
never
gotten
that
feeling
about
him
but
who
knows
does
to
be
honest
i
think
the
city
of
houston
loves
the
new
owner
he
has
brought
baseball
back
to
houston
with
key
acquisitions
players
that
were
from
the
houston
area
and
wanted
to
play
for
the
astros
i
dont
think
that
too
many
people
are
fearful
that
mclane
will
meddle
in
the
team
as
he
has
already
admitted
that
he
doesnt
know
a
whole
lot
about
baseball
mclane
is
a
businessman
and
doesnt
like
excuses
he
makes
a
valid
point
that
injuries
shouldnt
be
an
excuse
to
this
club
look
at
the
depth
of
the
bench
this
season
canadele
can
play
positions
bass
and
james
are
solid
outfielders
and
can
hit
well
too
uribe
is
nice
to
have
as
well
the
pitching
staff
has
legitimate
starters
were
dealing
with
a
young
houston
team
so
injuries
shouldnt
play
a
big
role
the
only
threat
is
the
bullpen
if
jonesy
goes
out
we
may
be
in
trouble
but
with
the
type
of
starters
we
have
this
season
there
is
less
pressure

is
seriously
being

why
dont
we
give

yeah
after

takes

it
can
take
in
eddie

and
jeff

um
what
eddie
murray
was
a
superb
first
baseman
for
a
long
time
winfield
as
produced
consistently
for
almsot
years
and
excellently
on
several
occasions
dave
kingmans
best
year
was
like
darryl
strawberrys
typical
year
with
the
mets
darrell
evans
too
did
a
whole
lot
more
than
just
hit
homers
which
is
all
that
kong
did
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall

consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
whom
are
you
talking
about
yes
eddie
murray
is
marginal
but
thats
because
hes
years
old
he
wasnt
marginal
for
a
long
time
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
not
smith
has
hung
around
for
a
long
time
and
fielded
the
position
better
than
anyone
else
ever
has
yount
stopped
being
a
shortstop
about
a
decade
ago
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
one
of
his
two
mvp
awards
was
as
a
centerfielder
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
like
whom
there
are
many
players
in
the
hall
who
arent
anywhere
near
as
goos
as
the
guys
youre
running
down
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
thats
already
the
case
by
some
standards
but
the
bad
players
in
the
hall
are
all
from
the
and
recent
picks
have
generally
been
excellent
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
no
but
who
cares
was
stan
musial
anywhere
near
as
good
as
babe
ruth
not
really
but
he
obviously
belongs
there
the
hall
has
generally
had
about
the
top
of
major
leaguers
as
more
players
come
through
the
game
more
will
be
in
that
top
and
yes
its
pretty
easy
to
argue
that
smith
yount
evans
winfield
etc
are
in
the
top
dave
kingman
on
the
other
hand
was
a
liability
throughout
most
of
his
career
of
course
garvey
hasnt
gotten
a
lot
of
hof
press
so
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
as
for
ryan
is
his
wl
better
than
morris
thats
what
a
lot
of
voters
tend
to
look
at
and
morris
was
awfully
good
for

and
doesnt

the

are

baseball
is

wider
tv
appeal
if
you
look
at
it
though
baseball
games
last
around
the
same
amount
of
time
as
football
games
the
difference
is
that
there
is
more
action
in
that
duration
in

games
perhaps
if
there
were
more
action
in
baseball
games
you
would
get
more
of
those
fans
to
tune
in
anyway
coming
up
with
a
solution
to
make
baseball
more
appealing
to
a
bigger
crowd
is
going
to
be
difficult
on
soapbox
yet
another
reason
to
get
a
commisioner
now
since
its
obvious
that
ruling
baseball
by
comittee
works
about
as
fast
as
a
snail
race
in
nebraska
off
soapbox
how
can
you
say
there
is
more
action
in
football
then
baseball
a
football
game
consists
of
approximately
plays
and
the
average
duration
of
a
play
is
around
seconds
this
means
that
in
a
game
that
lasts
approximately
hours
you
have
about
minute
s
of
action
in
a
baseball
game
you
have
upwards
of
two
hundred
pitches
there
are
very
few
on
field
strategy
on
field
stratgy
sessions
ie
huddles
and
you
always
have
a
chance
to
win
until
the
last
out
is
made
ah
but
the
illusion
in
football
is
that
there
is
always
lots
of
action
and
a
sense
of
urgency
because
of
the
game
clock
not
all
the
time
but
it
happens
when
theres
less
than
minutes
to
go
quite
often
this
sense
creates
drama
even
when
there
may
not
necessarily
be
any
and
that
holds
a
viewers
attention
in
baseball
only
players
are
involved
in
the
action

a

some
evidence
that
is
not
working
take
a
look
at
the
standings
its
real
easy
to
get
so
focussed
on
minutinae
and
forget
that
the
giants
happen
to
be
in
first
place
if
its
working
you
dont
screw
it
up
by
changing
things
just
because
you
think
it
ought
to
be
different
some
folks
like
to
argue
about
theoretical
details
i
prefer
to
watch
teams
win
when
the
giants
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus
on
whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it
is
ps
does
the
mailing
list
maintainer
think
that
will
clark
is
the
best
first
baseman
in
the
majors
and
that
matt
williams
is
a
better
power
hitter
than
any
other
ballplayer
in
the
majors
i
dont
follow
al
so
i
wont
comment
on
majors
in
the
nl
if
i
had
my
choice
of
any
in
the
league
for
my
team
itd
be
clark
and
id
hit
him
third
my
fantasy
team
has
both
grace
and
murray
on
it
because
ive
never
been
able
to
get
clark
id
take
any
of
the
three
without
hesitation
in
real
life
but
i
think
clark
is
it
williams
not
even
close
i
much
prefer
his
defense
but
when
he
isnt
headcasing
it
matt
has
a
good
solid
swing
and
some
real
punch
if
he
drops
to
then
he
wanders
out
of
cleanup
but
according
to
the
latest
baseball
weekly
hes
hitting
and
in
the
last
week
hitting
thats
not
exactly
chopped
liver
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that
continues
its
rather
silly

i

are
the
only

does
this
seem
dumb
to
anyone
else
the
fact
not
the
comment
why
should
a
batters
obp
be
hurt
by
a
sac
fly
especially
if
sac
bunts
dont
have
the
same
effect
since
they
do
the
same
thing
but
sac
flies
usually
score
a
run
while
bunts
just
advance
a
base
but
both
of
these
situations
involve
the
batter
giving
up
an
ab
for
the
benefit
of
the
team
sacrifice
so
why
should
it
hurt
their
stats
the
sac
bunt
is
a
purposeful
act
ordered
by
the
manager
the
batter
does
not
go
up
trying
to
get
a
sac
fly
and
the
evidence
available
indicates
that
there
is
no
such
ability
players
cant
will
themselves
to
hit
sac
flies
they
fly
out
to
the
same
place
just
as
often
when
theres
nobody
on
third
greg
sorry
i
gotta
disagree
here
last
time
i
played
ball
i
went
up
on
several
occasions
intending
to
hit
a
fly
ball
deep
enough
to
score
the
runner
from
third
or
advance
a
runner
to
third
its
relatively
easy
actually
you
swing
under
the
path
of
the
ball
you
normally
would
to
hit
a
good
line
drive
with
fastballs
its
very
easy
much
more
difficult
with
good
breaking
balls
a
good
hitter
with
excellent
bat
control
can
voluntarily
hit
fly
balls
to
the
outfield
at
least
oh
of
the
time
you
havent
been
facing
major
league
pitching
maybe
more
you
have
to
be
good
at
the
plate
and
most
of
those
guys
are
just
as
likely
to
opt
for
getting
the
base
hit
and
helping
their
average
as
getting
the
sacrifice
the
best
example
i
know
of
is
jerry
willard
in
the
series
against
minnesota
all
he
had
to
do
was
put
one
in
the
of
and
the
game
was
over
he
swung
waaaaaay
past
parallel
and
accomplished
barely
getting
the
run
in
safely
stats
did
a
little
study
in
the
scoreboard
book
entitled
can
you
hit
sacrifice
flies
on
purpose
a
summary
of
the
findings
over
the
year
period
sacfly
type
fly
balls
were
produced
percent
of
the
time
in
situations
where
a
sac
fly
was
useful
and
percent
of
the
time
when
a
sac
fly
wasnt
useful
they
looked
at
the
leaders
in
sac
flies
and
found
that
the
leaders
in
sac
flies
in
other
words
the
guys
you
would
expect
to
be
good
at
it
it
hit
sac
fly
type
fly
balls
only
more
often
when
they
needed
to
a
difference
way
too
small
to
be
the
result
of
a
skill
essentially
the
players
who
hit
a
lot
of
sac
flies
seem
to
do
so
because
they
hit
hit
sac
fly
type
flies
often
with
and
without
a
runner
on
third
stats
concludes
so
it
appears
conclusive
that
hitters
cannot
hit
sacrifice
flies
on
purpose
even
if
they
practice
in
the
batting
cage

a
fact
of

he

one
funny
story
is
that
during
spring
training
the

played
a
game
in
mexico
this
game
was
broadcast
back
to
atlanta
in

it
took
the
broadcasters
a
few
innings
to
get
a
rythm
going
because
they
had
to
keep
changing
their
location
seems
it
took
a

to
find
a

where
they
could
get

his

i

who

my

no

it

the

two

russell

playing
in
the
cavern
at
albany
aa
last
year
down
the
alleys
and
to
center
davis
went
with
homers
there
arent
any
small
parks
on
the
road
in
the
eastern
league
either
hes
and
his
mle
was
hr
i
have
no
fielding
statistics
but
from
seeing
him
a
number
of
times
last
year
id
say
that
hes
not
brooks
robinson
but
neither
is
he
howard
johnson
unless
they
think
they
can
win
the
pennant
this
year
which
seems
possible
and
need
boggs
to
do
it
i
think
theyre
making
the
same
sort
of
mistake
with
davis
that
boston
made
with
boggs
leaving
him
in
the
minors
for
two
or
three
years
after
hed
shown
that
he
was
a
good

much
rather
see

develop

whoever
wade

next
to
each

are

many

on

hrm
they
still
have
him
on

ab
through
the
first
two
weeks
theyve
just
never
figured
out
what
to
do
with
him
i
suspect
that
he
hits
enough
especially
vs
lefties
to
be
a
reasonable
shortstop
one
rumor
running
around
during
spring
training
was
that
they
wanted
to
convert
silvestri
to
be
a
catcher
because
his
body
type
was
wrong
for
a
shortstop
youd
think
that
somebody

yes
i
have
proof
there
are
really
only
two
adequate
ways
to
measure
fielding
prowess
the
first
which
has
the
advantage
of
being
applicable
to
older
players
since
it
uses
raw
data
available
for
almost
all
of
mlb
history
is
the
total
chances
per
game
method
favored
by
the
total
baseball
people
among
others
it
basically
says
that
you
measure
a
fielder
by
how
many
balls
he
gets
to
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
it
thus
favors
first
basemen
who
play
deep
reaching
a
lot
of
balls
but
forcing
the
pitcher
to
cover
first
more
frequently
it
also
hurts
first
baseman
who
play
behind
lefthanded
pitching
staffs
and
thus
face
few
lefthanded
batters
a
better
method
but
newer
and
based
ondata
that
has
only
been
collected
over
the
last
few
years
measures
the
percentage
of
balls
hit
into
the
part
of
the
field
the
guy
is
responsible
for
this
is
better
of
course
it
still
isnt
all

to
overcome
their
trademark
lack

crucial
situations
during

i
made
a
similarly

about

and
the
flames
were
flying
no
such
thing
as

all
screamed
i

they
also
meant
there
was
no
such
thing
as
any
kind
of

performance
given
their
comments
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
there
is
no
significant
ability
toi
perform
in
the
clutch
but
clutch
performance
certainly
happens
every
time
there
is
a

hit
the
clutch
pitching
quoted

is
something
which
happened
not
a
claim
that
any
particular
player
should
be
expected
to
be
a
clutch
pitcher
over
the
past
four
seasons
sabo
has
had
hits
in
abs
defined
as
clutch
situations

the
scouting
report
for
an
average
of

for
an
average
of

to
the
rest

such
as
this
is
completely

totally
random
and
cannot
be
used
for
any
reasonable
inference
such
as
perhaps
perez
should
have
used
a
pinch
hitter
in
that
situation
simple
statistics
tell
me
that
there
is
a
chance
an
average
clutch
hitter
would
have
this
large
a
split
the
average
decrease
is
points
standard
deviation
about
there
will
be
such
hitters
in
any
league
just
as
there
will
be
hitters
who
hit
poorly
on
tuesdays
and
there
is
only
a
very
weak
correlation
in
my
best
study
between
clutch
hitting
in
the
last
four
years
and
clutch
hitting
this
year
probably
because
most
of
the
clutch
data
is
determinaed
by
luck
rather
than
any
ability
based
only
on
this
data
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
pinchhit
for
sabo
or
any
other
player
who
had
been
a
poor
clutch
hitter
in
the
past
but
there
are
many
other
factors
involved
in
a
decision
to
pinchhit
does
the
pinchhitter
give
you
a
platoon
advantage
any
portion
of
sabos
clutch
split
that
results
from
his
platoon
split
is
certainly
a
real
ability
even
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
clutch
hitting
do
you
have
a
singles
hitter
at
the
plate
when
you
need
a
home
run
do
you
have
a
curveball

ideally
dhs
should

dh
if
he
can

that
would
take
care
of
position
corrected
anomolies
such
as
franks
since
that
is
not
the
case
and
why
not
is
it
always
this
way
then
we
are
going
to
have
trouble
finding
the
true
value
of
dhs
using
the
same
models
as
that
for
position
players
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
difference
the
main
reason
is
that
good
hitters
in
their
prime
such
as
frank
thomas
and
danny
tartabull
are
rarely
regular
dhs
even
if
they
cant
field
its
more
commonly
a
place
to
put
aging
veterans
another
use
of
the
dh
slot
is
to
help
a
player
come
back
from
injury
slowly
getting
his
bat
in
the
lineup
without
forcing
him
to
play
in
the
field
i
would
expect
such
players
to
hit
worse
as
dhs
than
they
did
during
the
rest
of
the
season
a
third
factor
is
that
most
player
who
split
time
between
dh
and
first
or
the
outfield
dont
hit
as
well
as
dhs
for
some
reason
reggie
jackson
was
a
good
example
in
five
years
as
a
rfdh
for
the
angels
he
hit
like
the
old
reggie
when
he
was
in
right
the
second
and
third
factors
will
be
lost
if
players
are
considered
by
their
primary
position
only
a
player
who
plays
games
in
right
and
at
dh
will
count
only
in
the
right
fielders
averages
a
logical
starting
place
would
be
to
look
at
defensive
replacement
value
if
you
can
find
it
for
or
lf
or
something
we
can
assume
that
if
forced
to
play
defense
they
would
play
at
true
zero
value
even
though
i
doubt
this
is
actually
true
for
players
like
winfield
and
molitor
this
would
let
us
discount
the
time
they
spend
playing
dh
because
that
forces
the
team
to
find
another
real
fielder
to
play
this
makes
sense
you
might
also
look
at
it
another
way
although
the
average
offensive
performance
of
a
dh
may
be
lower
than
for
a
left
fielder
the
replacementlevel
offensive
performance
is
certainly
lower
if
you
are
a
left
fielder
but
cant
hit
well
enough
to
keep
a
job
anywhere
then
you
certainly
cant

well
enough

elsewhere
on
this

sherri

repeats
her
position
that
batting

is
a

for

it
has
been
entirely

if
it
has

we
dont

how
to

if

at

i

you
would

had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
ill
try
to
avoid
being
insulting
but
its
difficult
when
you
so
cavalierly
dismiss
hundreds
of
hours
of
work
with
an
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
but
nobody
is
denying
that
there
are
people
who
have
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
past
but
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
method
to
predict
who
will
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
future
which
after
all
is
what
you
are
claiming
you
can
do
since
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict
the
future
i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
fine
we
have
plenty
of
data
obviously
our
preconceived
biases
must
be
coloring
our
work
since
you
know
clutch
hitting
is
a
welldefined
and
consistent
skill
all
of
our
failures
notwithstanding
so
i
challenge
you
to
prove
it
i
guarantee
you
that
if
you
can
prove
the
existance
of
some
form
of
clutch

you
will

plenty

happy
sdcns
dancing

i

i

under
a

set
of
circumstances
but
you
arent
going
to
win
any
support
by
merely

so
i
must
be

and
big
sigh
i
have
not

not
not
not
ever
called
you
or
anyone
else
on

stupid
it
is
nice
however
to
see
that
you
will
consider
the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived
biases
yeah
hindsight
is
always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
calling
and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
a
suggestion
take
data
from
and
attempt
to
come
up
with
some
method
that
predicts
who
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
if
that
works
we
can
then
attempt
to
apply
it
to
and
beyond
wait
a
minute
i
thought
i
first
had
to
define
clutch
hitting
do
i
or
dont
i
you
have
made
strong
statements
now
back
them
up
or
be
proven
a
total
idiot
i
made
two
statements
in
my
post
i
am
not
convinced
of
your
conclusions
regarding
clutch
hitting
i
would
have
hit
for
sabo
as
for
many
of
us
make
a
number
of
written
statements
through
this
media
about
what
we
think
will
happen
in
baseball
im
not
shy
about
it
ill
make
the
statement
again
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting

in

was

below
his
batting

it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters

average
in

is
not
going
to
be
as

as

thus
caused
the

offense
like
all

bosio
was
good
lucky
hard
grounder
by
vaughn
off
t
martinez
glove
but
straight
to
boone
who
threw
to
bosio
at
first
and
backed
by
good
defense
many
nontrivial
groundouts
the
game
was
amazingly
fast
as
the
sox
tended
to
go
down
quickly
and
hesketh
was
also
working
fast
the
sox
relief
pitching
was
ok
the
runs
off
quantrill
were
on
two
ridiculous
bloops
and
a
hard
line
single
which
greenwell
let
get
past
him
trying
for
a
catch
greenwells
mental
stability
is
a
serious
concern
i
guess
it
has
always
been
but
his
quirks
were
amusing
back
when
he
was
an
mvp
candidate
wednesday
he
got
in
a
huff
with
johnson
a
after
striking
out
on
a
bad
inside
pitch
apparently
johnson
made
an
ok
ive
got
to
stay
focused
gesture
which
iron
mike
interpreted
as
taunting
and
struck
out
to
heavy
booing
the
next
two
times
as
valentine
noted
last
night
he
came
up
in
the
first
after
riles
and
quintana
had
walked
to
open
the
game
can
you
say
take
the
first
pitch
not
mike
who
dribbled
it
into
a
the
pi
quoted
bosio
that
this
was
a
batting
practice
fastball
next
time
up
he
also
hit
the
first
pitch
a
hard
liner
straight
to
kgjr
in
center
he
also
made
the
pathetic
error
and
failed
to
catch
boones
hr
which
looked
comparable
to
the
ball
lance
johnson
caught
on
the
highlight
reel
that
night
is
riles
suppsoed
to
be
good
defensively
i
couldnt
tell
from
the
field
angle
but
his
range
looked
bad
and
he
coughed
a
dp
that
cost
a
run
or
two
why
was
he
leadoff
i
hope
fletcher
gets
well
soon
also
on
lineups
pinella
put
bret
boone
fifth
for
reasons
beyond
me
it
seemed
to
work
as
he
was
with
a
hr
and
some
good
defense
a
wag
behind
us
said
he
sure
dont
want
to
go
back
to
calgary
there
is
a
theory
that
you
put
a
leadoff
type
fifth
because
theyll
likely
lead
off
the
second
as
boone
did
well
now
we
face

can
anyone
out

tell

why
they

i
dont
know
about
the
story

it
comes
from
the
fact
that
in
most
stadiums
the
batter
faces
northeast
and
so
when
a

is

his

bosios

i
watched
the
final
inning
of
bosios
nohitter
with
several
people
at
work
after
vizquel
made
that
barehanded
grab
of
the
chopper
up
the
middle
someone
remarked
that
if
he
had
fielded
it
with
his
glove
he
wouldnt
have
had
time
to
throw
riles
out
yet
the
throw
beat
riles
by
about
two
steps
i
wonder
how
many
others
who
watched
the
final
out
think
vizquel
had
no
choice
but
to
make
the
play
with
his
bare
hand
does
anybody
think
vizquel
was
wrong
to
field
the
ball
barehanded
and
if
he
failed
to
field
it
cleanly
would
it
or
should
it
have
been
an
error
or
a
hit
judging
from
bosios
grimace
when
the
ball
bounced
past
him
he
must
have
thought
it
would
go
through
for
a
hit
whether
vizquel
was
right
or
wrong
he
certainly
made
one
hell

re

for

in
article
writes
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
but
ingnoring
putouts
is
biased
in
yet
another
way
range
is
not
the
only
thing
that
makes
a
good
firstbaseman
the
ability
to
field
all
sorts
of
balls
thrown
to
him
digging
some
out
of
the
dirt
stretching
for
others
and
so
forth
is
important
thus
putouts
do
provide
some
information
maybe
what
we
need
is
a
comparision
of
how
many
balls
were
thrown
to
the
area
of
the

vs
how
many

cool
and
thank
you
for
an
intelligent
response
devoid
of
the

namecalling

one
of
the
basic
things
you
need
to
have
in
a
statistic
to
be
able
to
predict
a
players
performance
on
it
in
the
future
is
for
there
to
be
a
correlation
from
year
to
year
a
players
batting
average
is
correlated
fairly
well
from
year
to
year
ok
the
basic
problems
with
something
like
clutch
batting
average
overall
batting
average
is
that
the
correlation
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
adding
to
the
sample
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
actually
i
think
the
largescale
sample
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
as
a
counterexample
to
what
you
showed
consider
the
following
two
players
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
players
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situations
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
before
you
accuse
me
of
completely
cooking
the
data
you
wont
hear
those
kind
of
accusations
from
me
it
is
interesting
that
you
selected
maldonado
because
he
is
someone
whom
i
have
also
looked
at
he
has
been
a
very
inconsistent
hitter
in
terms
of
ba
hitting
in
admittedly
he
has
been
traded
between
leagues
as
well
as
clubs
his
clutch
hitting
record
is
equally
inconsistent
so
for
my
purposes
in
i
would
not
draw
any
conclusions
about
his
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
based
on
his
prior
performance
i
dont
know
how
i
would
have
felt
in
but
you
may
indeed
be
right
when
i
looked
at
sabo
i
found
a
more
consistent
record
of
hitting
and
a
more
consistent
pattern
of
his
clutch
hitting
being
proportionately
below
his
nonclutch
ba
ditto
for
joe
carter
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
btw
correlating
players
overall
batting
average
from
with
gives
a
correlation
coefficient
of
which
is
significant
at
something
better
than
the
confidence
level
correlating
their
clutchnonclutch
ba
for
the
same
period
gives
a
correlation
of
significant
at
no
level
of
any
interest
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
actually
its
technically
incorrect
to

that
we

clutch
performance

you

right
id
call
that

if
you

at

i
assume
you
would

for
letting

rather
than
pinch

im
sure
some
of

you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular

is
this
not

i
would
have
used
aspects

in

there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at

and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict

i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
that
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
when
perez
left
sabo
in
he
was
predicting
the
future
the
next
ab
he
was
predicting
that
sabo
was
more
likely
to
get
a
hit
than
samuel
by
supporting
the
swap
you
are
predicting
the
opposite
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some

to
your

well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
right
this
is
the
beef
it
has
not
proven
to
be
an
indicator
of
future
performance
under
any
circumstances
at
least
none
that
weve
been
able
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indicator
of
future
performance
please
let
us
in
on
your
secret
it
is
nice
however
to
see
that
you
will
consider
the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived
biases
most
certainly
as
i
have
repeatedly
stated
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
study
which
even
hints
at
a
consistent
clutch
ability
i
would
love
it
however
the
straightforward
attempts
at
such
a
study
have
all
failed
miserably
yeah
hindsight
is
always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
calling
and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
well
it
was
a
stupid
argument
are
you
honestly
debating
that
sure
we
know
sabo
didnt
get
a
hit
we
have
no
idea
whether
samuel
would
have
done
any
better
or
not
one
ab
most
certainly
doesnt
prove
anything
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
no
this
doesnt
prove
any
overall
statistical
trend
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
across
the
breadth
of
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
why
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correlate

disagree
with
one
specific
argument
that

means
nothing
it
seems
to
me
that
a
firstbasemans
defensive
value
is
not
entirely

even
primarily
from
his

how
many
such

does
he
get

many
fewer

p
i

the
total
of
these
is
much
higher
than

totals
this
implies
to
me
that
there
is
value
in
catching
these
throws
well
even
if
they
are
high
uptheline

in

occurences
of

but
id
guess
that
the
values
of
these
abilities
are
similar
its
just
like
you
dont
judge
catchers
defense
primarily
on
how
they
field
bunts

popups

i

is

the

closer

now

it

to

there

actually
i

the

is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs

the
yaxis
being
the
number
of

certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
right
most
definitely
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
this
may
be
the
root
of
the
confusion
please
consider
the
following
hypothetical
with
an
open
mind
note
that
i
am
not
yet
saying
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
at
hand
suppose
we
have
a
simplified
lotto
game
you
pick
a
number
from
and
win
if
that
number
is
drawn
suppose
we
have
a
large
population
of
people
who
play
this
game
every
week
in
the
first
year
of
the
game
approximately
of
the
population
will
win
or
more
times
in
the
second
year
of
the
game
of
those
winners
will
again
be
winners
in
the
third
year
of
the
game
of
those
who
won
or
more
times
in
each
of
the
first
two
years
will
win
again
suppose
i
started
with
people
in
my
population
after
three
years
i
have
people
who
have
consistently
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
won
or
more
the
number
of
times
expected
do
we
expect
them
to
be
big
winners
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
game
no
because
we
know
there
is
no
skill
involved
nothing
about
these
consistent
winners
can
influence
their
chances
of
winning
but
suppose
we
dont
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
chance
that
skill
might
be
involved
perhaps
some
of
the
people
in
our
population
are
psychic
or
something
how
would
we
test
this
hypothesis
we
can
look
for
correlations
in
the
population
now
most
of
the
population
will
show
zero
correlation
but
our
psychics
should
show
a
high
positive
correlation
even
if
they
arent
very
good
psychics
they
should
still
manage
to
win
or
more
times
most
years
net
result
a
small
positive
correlation
over
the
entire
population
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
well
zero
correlation
is
zero
correlation
you
mention
that
sabo
has
hit
poorly
in
the
clutch
over
the
last
years
but
if
we
look
at
the
past
we
find
that
clutch
patterns
are
just
as
likely
to
reverse
as
they
are
to
remain
consistent
the
length
of
the
streak
doesnt
seem
to
make
a
difference
to
the
probability
that
the
player
will
be
clutch
or
choke
the
next
year
is
there
any
reason
to
expect
this
streak
to
be
different
from
past
streaks
now
if
it
were
true
that
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remained
true
to
form
then
we
might
have
something
useful
but
then
we
wouldnt
have
zero
correlation
instead
we
have
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remain
true
to
form
and
of
all
threeyear
streaks
reverse
you
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
choke
this
year
but
it
would
be
equally
valid
to
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
be
clutch
this
year
since
the
probabilities
are
split
each
way
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
then
we
would
have
something
useful
and
we
would
also
have
a
positive
correlation
but
for
every
individual
that
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
holds
true
there
is
another
who
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
then
reverses

as

i

some
things
that

it
might
be
better
to

his

in

hiphop
sense
because
it
fits
in
with
what
i
want
to
say
maynardramseycslaurentianca
roger
maynard
writes
but
the
point
is
that
the
only
decision
making
pro
cess
used
to
determine
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
lates
to
the
teams
not
the
individual
players
there
is
no
method
inherent
in
baseball
of
comparing
individual
performances
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
because
after
all
baseball
is
a
team
game
theres
an
interesting
parallel
between
this
way
of
viewing
a
baseball
team
and
some
peoples
conception
of
a
biological
organism
in
the
biology
context
we
would
very
likely
read
fitness
for
the
score
of
the
game
and
organisms
for
teams
how
we
interpret
players
is
trickier
but
either
organs
or
genes
might
seem
reasonable
choices
depending
on
what
point
we
were
trying
to
make
a
genes
interpretation
actually
might
be
really
interesting
in
this
case
but
that
would
be
a
different
and
probably
longer
post
if
however
we
take
the
organ
view
then
our
knowledge
of
biology
should
make
us
pause
before
we
start
saying
things
like
species
x
is
more
fit
than
species
y
because
of
a
better
organ
z
given
what
we
know
about
the
interdependence
of
organs
we
would
often
be
suspicious
of
such
claims
but
note
that
this
type
of
argument
is
quite
often
made
when
you
map
species
x
onto
humans
and
organ
z
onto
brain
on
the
other
hand
some
statements
of
this
kind
do
seem
more
reasonable
than
others
as
far
as
we
can
test
them
eg
brain
above
might
be
more
reasonable
than
pancreas
assuming
no
gross
pathology
particularly
if
species
y
is
a
primate
even
when
you
make
such
statements
you
should
be
concerned
with
the
functioning
of
the
whole
organism
and
the
possibility
that
one
organ
might
be
more
crucial
for
one
species
and
a
second
organ
in
another
not
to
mention
the
possibility
that
no
organ
is
particularly
crucial
in
some
third
species
however
if
we
are
nonvitalists
with
any
kind
of
reductionsit
streak
we
will
want
to
say
that
an
organism
is
not
some
completely
magical
unanalyzable
whole
but
an
intriguing
process
made
up
of
various
subprocesses
that
interact
in
ways
that
are
potentially
observable
some
of
these
processes
might
be
localized
to
particular
organs
while
others
may
be
distributed
across
multiple
organs
in
a
way
this
is
just
like
a
baseball
team
except
that
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
processes
and
interactions
involved
in
baseball
are
much
simpler
and
less
numerous
than
in
most
organisms
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
another
is
to
be
able
to
say
ab
solutely
that
player
as
team
would
have
played
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
speculation
impossible
to
ascertain
one
thing
that
is
quite
difficult
about
baseball
is
that
perfectly
controlled
experiments
are
sometimes
very
tough
to
do
but
of
course
this
has
never
stopped
researchers
from
doing
the
best
they
can
and
sometimes
deriving
very
powerful
conclusions
even
in
the
absence
of
certainty
most
of
this
goes
far
beyond
sheer
speculation
but
even
sheer
speculation
can
motivate
further
interesting
research
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
than
another
pitcher
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
in
this
cases
were
seeing
the
word
statistics
means
summary
of
observed
events
where
the
events
themselves
can
be
viewed
as
the
output
of
some
process
and
possibly
inputs
for
other
processes
thus
if
we
have
any
valid
notion
of
how
the
processes
are
put
together
into
the
functioning
organism
data
in
the
form
of
statistics
might
give
us
a
basis
to
test
particular
hypotheses
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
baseball
this
statement
brings
us
back
to
the
concept
of
fitness
again
fitness
is
defined
in
terms
of
both
an
organism
and
its
environment
you
might
be
fit
in
one
situation
and
not
another
moving
to
baseball
it
is
clear
that
each
team
spends
the
entire
season
in
an
environment
including
all
the
other
teams
in
the
league
in
at
least
a
nominal
sense
the
division
winners
are
the
fittest
teams
in
the
league
in
that
they
on
average
had
better
fitness
scores
than
any
of
their
competing
opponennts
but
in
a
real
sense
there
is
a
fairly
large
random
component
in
the
performance
of
each
team
that
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
account
for
in
terms
of
factors
intrinsic
to
or
interesting
for
baseball
the
same
is
true
in
biology
but
here
is
also
no
direct
biological
equivalent
of
the
world
series
in
basebal
in
the
world
series
the
random
component
may
be
greatly
magnified
by
the
small
number
of
games
that
are
played
and
both
teams
suddenly
experience
huge
changes
from
the
environement
where
they
were
originally
successful
it
might
be
fun
to
watch
but
its
unclear
what
it
all
really
means
now
just
one
more
unrelated
point
i
have
yet
to
see
that
any
of
you
can
predict
a
ws
winner
with
any
greater
accuracy
than
jeanne
dixon
on
the
other
hand
you
have
seen
some
of
us
who
can
predict
the
outcome
of
the
divisional
races
better
than
a
random
assignment
of
teams
to
finishes
and
maybe
some
of
us
eg
me
who
can
do
this
better
than
the
other
participants
in
this
forum
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
is

youve

percentage
the

are
a
nice
hobby
and
thats
about
it
there
is
no
new
knowledge
being
produced
since
stats
are
summaries
of
events
its
true
that
if
you
know
the
events
you
can
derive
the
stats
but
if
somebody
is
trying
to
understand
the
process
behind
the
stats
then
the
stats
produce
new
knowledge
and
some
of
this
might
even
be
reliable
repeatable

useful
speaking
of
which
i
should
get
back

in

one
rumor
running

was
that
they

he
said
a

sht
i
know
boggs
had
some
personal
problems
while
playing
for
boston
but
come
on
hes
a
future
hall
of
famer
who
really
adds
a
needed
dimension
to
the
yanks
a
solid
hitter
a
decent
fielder
and
more
importantly
a
teacher
ask
pat

i
think
hes
got
a

good

left

may
be

the

as
they

it

some

i

the

is

me
that
if

all
the

in

ba
deviation
we
would

curve
the
xaxis
being
the

in

the
yaxis
being
the
number
of

certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
lets
be
careful
here
if
players
performance
was
completely
random
in
clutchno
clutch
then
you
would
still
expect
some
players
to
be
good
in
the
clutch
every
year
and
some
to
be
notsogood
every
year
with
two
years
worth
of
data
youd
have
of
the
players
good
each
year
bad
each
year
and
would
have
one
good
and
one
bad
year
we
have
players
for
years
just
flipping
a
coin
youd
expect
players
to
be
good
all
years
and
to
be
bad
every
year
this
is
what
we
actually
get
no
of
good
years
clutch
performers
coin
flip
random
essentially
the
distribution
of
clutch
performers
by
number
of
years
of
good
performance
is
the
same
as
what
you
would
get
if
the
process
leading
to
deviations
from
nonclutch
performance
was
completely
random
if
there
was
anything
to
clutch
hitting
at
least
in
this
definition
that
had
any
predictive
capability
you
expect
to
see
the
number
of
players
at
the
ends
to
be
much
larger
than
that
predicted
by
flipping
a
coin
further
if
you
limit
yourself
to
players
who
were
a
lot
above
or
below
average
in
clutch
situations
say
standard
deviation
from
the
mean
more
than
one
year
the
random
explanation
still
looks
good
in
the
four
years
that
i
looked
at
the
data
from
elias
there
were
players
with
a
minimum
of
at
bats
in
clutch
situations
that
were
sigma
from
the
mean
two
different
years
of
those
players
of
them
changed
sign
between
the
two
years
in
other
words
they
were
great
clutch
hitters
one
year
and
really
horrible
the
other
year
if
it
was
just
a
random
process
youd
expect
those
numbers
to
be
everything
thats
been
measured
about
clutch
hitting
over
a
period
of
years
that
could
be
used
to
predict
any
ability
with
any
proposed
definition
has
looked
like
a
random
process
with
the
caveat
that
there
may
be
something
related
to
platoon
advantage
that
could
be
dragged
out
of
the
dataeg
john
lowenstein
probably
never
had
a
clutch
ab
against
a
lefthanded
pitcher
but
he
might
well
have
had
some
in
blowouts
so
that
there
would
be
a
bias
since
his
clutch
abs
would
be
more
geared
to
his
platoon
advantage
this
is
not

the

line
says
it
all
what
is
the
rule
that
qualifies
a
pitcher
as
making
a
save
imho
this
is
the
most
untrustworthy
silly
stat
by
todays
rules
in
all
of
baseball
my
understanding
is
to
qualify
as
a
save
a
pitcher
cannot
pitch
more
than
three
innings
and
the
potential
tying
run
must
at
least
appear
in
the
ondeck
circle
also
the
lead
a
pitcher
enters
with
cannot
excede
three
runs
i
believe
that
the
official
scorers
must
assert
more
of
their
authority
in
determining
winnerssaversetc
for
instance
a
pitcher
can
come
in
in
the
ninth
with
a
lead
blow
the
lead
fall
behind
have
his
team
come
back
in
the
next
half
inning
and
earn
the
win
has
this
pitcher
earned
a
win
no
way
i
guy
could
pitch
five
strong
innings
of
middle
relief
and
see
his
teammates
rally
to
tie
the
score
assume
he
came
in
to
start
the
fourth
and
left
after
the
eighth
his
teammate
holds
the
opposition
scoreless
in
the
ninth
and
they
score
a
run
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
to
win
the
third
pitcher
earns
the
win

the

im

they

a

how

all

his

is
awful
what
the

do
speeding
tickets
have
to
do
with
clubhouse
influence
anyway
so
why
do
sportswriters
talk
about
it
all
the

uh
he
also
has
been
charged
with
chasing
his
wife
in
a
car
and
smashing
it
into
a
tree
as
well
as
carrying
a

firearm
in

and
the

reported
was
over

reckless

brian
hunter

keith
mitchell
both
of
whom
had

problems
towards
the
end
of
last

two
years
ago
it
was
cited
as
a
sign
of
their
immaturity
etc
actually
i
hadnt
heard
about
this
thanks
meanwhile
dykstra
almost
killed
both
himself
and
daulton
and
i
didnt
read
any
sportswriter
complaining
about
that
they
may
have
talked
about
how
bad
it
was
for
the
phillies
but
i
never
read
anywhere
criticism
of
dykstras
character
or
daultons
intelligence
for
that
matter
based
on
this
incident
i
dont
know
what
you
were
reading
or
watching
but
i
sure
saw
a
lot
about
that
and
about
dykstras
poker
games
most
of
the
writing
was
along
the
lines
of
how
incredibly
stupid
and
selfish
it
was
and
how
hed
hurt
the
team
by
wracking
himself
and
the
catcher
up
etc
espn
raised
questions
about
his
judgement
etc
the
print
media
here
in
the
sf
area
questioned
why
disciplinary
action
wouldnt
be
taken
against
dykstra
and
one
article
pointed
out
that
if
lenny
wanted
to
kill
himself
there
were
ways
that
wouldnt
endanger
other
peoples
lives
then
there
was
dykstra
himself
being
quoted
on
how
stupid
it
was

acted

any

yes
i
think
he
should
have
done
more
to
get
out
of

way
as
much
as
fans
want
to
catch
a
ball
they
really
should
be
aware
that
winning
the
game
is
more
important
as
a
dodger
fan
he
has
to
be
aware
that
this
is
the
home
stadium
and
that
entails
helping
the
home
team
win
in
any
way
possible
as
soon
as
the
ball
was
hit
that
far
his
first
instinct
should
be
to
root
for
darryl
to
catch
it
not
to
try
to
catch
it
himself
particularly
when
he
is
sitting
that
close
i
enjoy
the
attitude
of
the
wrigley

where
they
are
against
visiting
team
home
runs
so
much
they
actually
throw
them
back
on
the
field
now
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
darryl
could
have
caught
it
or
not
sure
he
probably
screwed
up
but
the
fan
should
realize
his
first
responsibility
is
to
get

the
offseason
newspapers
notesgroup
etc
but
i
had
my
first
up
close
and
personal
last
night
at
the
stick
after
watching
giants
hitters
struggle
last
year
barrys
swing
was
very
impressive
hes
very
quick
and
his
swing
seems
effortless
even
compared
to
clark
particularly
clark
as
of
late
it
was
interesting
to
see
bonds
hit
maddux
so
well
im
not
sure
if
barry
was
after
revenge
against
the
braves
or
what
but
he
stroked
three
very
pretty
hits
hr
for
rbis
the
giants
always
hit
maddux
well
but
it
was
interesting
that
maddux
did
not
pitch
around
bonds
to
get
to
clayton
last
night
he
threw
straight
fastballs
over
the
plate
to
bonds
in
the
last
night
got
away
with
the
first
one
but
bonds
hit
the
second
one
out
of
the
park
then
in
the
when
clark
was
at
third
base
with
one
out
maddux
did
not
intentionally
walk
bonds
and
bonds
dropped
a
single
to
leftcenter
the
giants
as
a
team
are
doing
a
lot
of
surprising
things
this
year
in
addition
to
bonds
there
has
been
some
good
pitching
and
some
hitters
seem
to
be
swinging
much
better
claytons
defense
has
been
superb
mcgee
seems
to
like
leading
off
this
year
manwaring
is
driving
the
ball
so
on
so
forth
the
braves
announcers
pointed
out
that
mcgee
as
a
leadoff
hitter
has
not
scored
a
run
yet
he
will
always
hit
around
but
im
concerning
about
his
onbase
percentage
the
key
in
the
lineup
is
matt
williams
he
has
to
stay
hot
so
that
bonds
can
hit
with
runners
on
base
i
hope
it
continuesi
think
they
need
to
continue
well
into
june
before
people
are
really
sold
that
they
are
for
realparticularly
the
pitching
the
pitching
gets
a
set
back
as
bud
black
is
placed
on
the
dl
burba
has
done
a
superb
job
filling
in
so
far
he
looks
like
a
different
pitcher
from
last
year
however
swift
is
terrible
in
both
of
his
starts
with
burba
moving
into
the
rotation
mike
jackson
is
the
only
righthanded
reliever
aside
from
rod
beck
hell
get
a
lot
of
actions
i
also
hope
that
dusty
can
manage
his
bullpen
better
than
roger
craig
especially
on
beck
i
was
concerned
when
beck
was
used
for
straight
days
earlier
this
week
for
myself
i
think
the
fresh
start
of
magowanbakeretc
has
really
wiped
out
a
lot
of
negatives
from
the
last
few
years
and
will
be
a
real
factor
in
helping
them
significantly
improve
over
last
year
so
far
so
good

the

some

take
a

its
real
easy
to
get
so
focussed
on

and
forget
that
the

happen
to

if
its
working
you
dont
screw
it
up
by
changing

just

you

it

that
is
the
reason
why
the
toronto

should
keep
alfredo

just
because
it
worked
a
team
winning
doesnt

that
everything
that

a

not

doesnt

everything

otherwise

you
would

some
folks
like

i
prefer
to
watch
teams

the

slip
to

then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus
on
whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it
is
by
then
its
too
late
the
problem
with
not
fixing
something
while
its
working
is
that
by
then
there
may
not
be
anything
left
to
fix
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that
continues
its
rather
silly
to
secondguess
their
strategy
but
evidently
some
folks
would
rather
be
right
than
be
first
so
the

were

perfect

there
was

since

his

seemed

different
he
stands
more
erect

very
open
with
his

foot
pointing

im
wondering
if
this
is
a
recent
change
in
stance
for

andres
had
one
glaring
weakness
as

he
could

if

a

maybe

dennis

you

when

you

i
dont

anyone

they

we
can
believe
that

we
have

and
therefore
will

i
am
not
dismissing
your

im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your

renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of

is
some

well
yes
you

you
claim

be
incapable
of

i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling

you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
think
seeing
insults
in
other
peoples
opinions
is
kind
of
silly
after
all
mark
didnt
call
you
a
total
idiot
or
call
your

stupid
he
simply
stated
that
it
didnt
change
his
opinion
on
the
subject
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
right
this
is
the
beef
it
has
not
proven
to
be
an
indicator
of
future
performance
under
any
circumstances
at
least
none
that
weve
been
able
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indicator
of
future
performance
please
let
us
in
on
your
secret
if
player
a
hits
better
on
tuesdays
and
always
has
and
mark
believes
that
it
might
be
an
indication
that
he
will
hit
on
tuesday
better
next
season
as
well
would
you
respond
the
same
way
at
some
point
you
might
admit
that
all
variable
might
not
be
known
to
you
who
knows
what
this
guy
does
every
monday
night
maybe
he
sees
his
sports
shrink
on
tuesday
mornings
or
has
his
vitamin
b
shots
monday
nights
but
this
is
something
thats
true
of
one
guy
only
it
doesnt
mean
that
there
will
be
a
meaningful
correlation
for
the
entire
league
by
days
of
the
week
nor
that
there
should
be
but
it
doesnt
mean
we
cant
make
predictions
based
on
that
for
that
particular
player
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
i
only
see
a
prediction
for
one
player
here
i
dont
see
anything
about
all
batters
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
thats
exactly
what
mark
is
trying
to
do
though
find
hitters
that
have
these
correlation
and
ask
whether
we
can
make
predictions
for
these
hitters
based
on
their
past
performance
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in

with
anything
whether

cant

it

you
can
only
make
an
argument
that
you
dont

it
is

to
continue

exist
because
you
cant
see
a

for
it
to
exist
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
someone
posted
recently
on
why
negative

would

lines

condition

always

in

pitcher
to
face
him
where
his

will
not

him
for

dont

it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling

even

lets
not

shea
which
was
designed

both
the

it
was
the
first

i
think
to
have
the
box
seats
on
rollers
so
they
could
be
oriented
at
right
angles
for

in

for

minor
point
shea
stadium
was
designed
as
a
multipurpose
stadium
but
not
with
the
jets
in
mind
as
the
tennant
the
new
york
football
giants
had
moved
to
yankee
stadium
from
the
polo
grounds
in
and
was
having
problem
with
stadium
management
the
city
did
not
own
yankee
stadium
until
the
idea
was
to
get
the
giants
to
move
into
shea
when
a
deal
was
worked
out
between
the
giants
and
the
yankees
the
new
afl
franchise
the
new
york
titans
approached
the
city
about
using
the
new
stadium
the
titans
were
playing
in
downing
stadium
where
the
cosmos
played
soccer
in
the
because
shea
stadium
was
tied
into
the
worlds
fair
anyway
the
city
thought
it
would
be
a
novel
idea
to
promote
the
new
franchise
and
the
worlds
fair
like
they
were
doing
with
the
mets
so
the
deal
was
worked
out
of
course
with
the
jets
gone
to
jersey
and
a
truly
good
football
stadium
the
mets
are
saddled
with
a
multipurpose
stadium
where
because
its
circular
the
seats
are
almost
always
too
far
from
the
action
the
mets
announcerskiner
murphy
in
particularhave
always
hyped
it
as
beautiful
shea
stadium
a
tipoff
to
how
unbeautiful
it
truly
is
im
under
the
impression
that
when
murph
says
it
he
means
it
as
a
regular
goer
to
shea
it
is
not
a
bad
place
since
theyve
cleaned

renovated
the

darryl
has
not

he
has
to
blame
someone
but
i
guess
the
big
debate
continues
as
to
what
are
the
responsibilities
of
the

as
long
as
the

doesnt

this

he

of
his

last

he

this

about
being

he
was
constantly
giving

the

the

was
his

coach
at

last

now
as
his
manager
is
continuing
to
work
with
him
maybe
andres
has
a
weak
left
eye
and
the
open
stance
gives
him
a
better
look
at
the
ball
or
maybe
it
is
simply
improving
his
mechanics
i
dunno
but
the
change
seems
to
have
enabled
him
to
hit
the
ball
as
well
as
years
ago
his
selectivity
has
not
changed

the

it
also
contains

all
what
is
the

that
qualifies

as
making
a

imho
this
is
the
most
untrustworthy
silly
stat
by
todays
rules
in
all
of
baseball
my
understanding
is
to
qualify
as
a
save
a
pitcher
cannot
pitch
more
than
three
innings
and
the
potential
tying
run
must
at
least
appear
in
the
ondeck
circle
also
the
lead
a
pitcher
enters
with
cannot
excede
three
runs
this
is
a
phenomenon
known
around
work
as
readyfireaim
i
am
astounded
at
the
number
of
times
people
post
strong
opinions
about
things
they
not
only
dont
understand
but
publicly
admit
to
not
understanding
in
fact
theres
a
plausible
argument
that
saves
are
a
more
rational
stat
than
wins
for
the
record
there
are
two
ways
that
a
reliever
can
get
a
save
he
must
finish
the
game
and
either
have
entered
the
game
with
the
tying
run
on
base
at
bat
or
on
deck
have
pitched
at
least
three
innings
effectively
a
pitcher
may
not
get
a
win
and
a
save
in
the
same
game
i
believe
that
the
official
scorers
must
assert
more
of
their
authority
in
determining
winnerssaversetc
for
instance
a
pitcher
can
come
in
in
the
ninth
with
a
lead
blow
the
lead
fall
behind
have
his
team
come
back
in
the
next
half
inning
and
earn
the
win
has
this
pitcher
earned
a
win
no
way
but
this
is
an
argument
that
wins
is
a
dumb
stat
not
saves
i
guy
could
pitch
five
strong
innings
of
middle
relief
and
see
his
teammates
rally
to
tie
the
score
assume
he
came
in
to
start
the
fourth
and
left
after
the
eighth
his
teammate
holds
the
opposition
scoreless
in
the
ninth
and
they
score
a
run
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
to
win
the
third
pitcher
earns
the
win
and
the
middle
reliever
gets
no
stat
satisfaction

somewhat
at

i
did

nor
did
i
imply
that
i
could
predict

you
have
inferred
that
my
comments
meant
this
and
you
have
based
your
rebuttal
of
my
comments
on
the
fact
that
statistical
studies
have
demonstrated
that
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
predicting
future
performance
in
regard
to
clutch
hitting
sabo
samuel
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
yet
you
would
pinchhit
samuel
because
you
predict
that
samuel
will
be
a
clutch
hitter
and
sabo
will
be
a
choke
hitter
right
id
call
that
predicting
the
future
that
is
your
opinion
that
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
the
above
data
is
for
a
period
ending
last
season
last
season
samuel
batted
while
sabo
hit
not
park
adjusted
this
season
they
are
both
hitting
below
albeit
sabo
with
more
at
bats
i
will
agree
that
over
his
career
sabo
has
been
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
but
i
will
also
remind
you
that
samuel
has
been
a
better
hitter
in
certain
situations
than
sabo
i
did
not
predict
that
sabo
would
choke
nor
that
samuel
would
get
a
hit
i
expressed
my
opinion
that
had
i
been
the
reds
manager
or
even
a
reds
fan
that
i
would
prefer
to
have
samuel
hit
in
that
situation
than
sabo
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
right
i
would
have
used
aspects
of
prior
performance
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consistent
in
the
past
overall
performance
lr
splits
even
matching
hittingpitching
styles
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantage
if
used
properly
ah
properly
yes
i
see
even
if
all
else
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at
past
clutch
performance
and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
please
help
me
what
exactly
is
everything
else
that
pointed
to
sabo
well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
must
say
i
was
not
aware
of
the
publication
can
you
email
me
the
information
regarding
its
availability
and
i
guess
i
must
apologize
to
all
of
those
who
have
done
extensive
study
on
say
supply
side
economics
i
didnt
mean
to
insult
you
but
i
never
did
believe
you
were
on
the
right
path
im
sorry
for
my
contrary
opinionposition
i
also
regret
that
i
dont
have
the
ability
to
prove
that
you
are
wrong
but
you
are
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
the
second
is
your
statement
not
mine
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
well
actually
i
havent
yet
but
im
not
finished
looking
that
is
i
havent
yet
found
someone
who
hit
significantly
below
his
overall
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
for
the
years
and
then
reversed
that
relationship
in
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
why
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correlate
nope
sorry
but
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
chris
sabos
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
joe
carters
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
but
youre
not
interested
in
that
because
you
think
that
those
conclusions
could
only
be
valid
if
they
could
be
extrapolated
over
the
entire
baseball
population
and
they
cant
be
the
stupid
was
in
reference
to
a
statement
which
was
stupid
and
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deny
it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling
to
even
consider
evidence
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fits
nicely
the
problem
here
is
that
i
do
believe
you
i
accept
your
work
i
believe
that
trying
to
predict
future
clutch
performance
based
on
prior
clutch
history
is
meaningless
no
better
than
a
coin
toss
i
actually
do
accept
your
work
as
it
happens
i
also
have
an
opinion
that
in
certain
situations
for
certain
players
a
history
of
superior
or
inferior
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
might
suggest
a
reason
what
such
history
could
be
valid
in
projecting
future
player
performance
for
that
player
and
chris
sabo
is
one
such
player
so
tell
me
does
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
well
since
i
defer
to
your
statistical
wisdom
i
think
i

note
that

indeed
you

right
at
the

of
our

to
rebut
my
opinion
you
have
made
an
analogy
with
a

of

your
hypothesis
assumes
that
the
lotto
players
have
no
impact
on
the
selection
of
the
numbers
and
hence
their
ability
to
win
well
thats
certainly
true
in

but
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
sport
of
baseball
when
you
start
down
the
wrong
path
you
finish
down
the
wrong
path
i
repeat
i
do
not
think
that
statistical
analysis
of
prior
clutch
hitting
performance
is
an
accurate
predictor
of
future
clutch
hitting
performance
i
do
however
think
that
analysis
of
prior
clutch
hitting
performance
may
for
some
players
indicate
a
deficiency
in
their
game
that
indeed
will
provide
a
basis
for
projecting

your

you
get

well
the
rulebook
says
that
in
the
opinion
of
the

you
must
have
pitched
effectively
for

this

is
not
automatic
unlike
the

someone
in

actually
looked
at

a

and
found

who
cares
amusing
isnt
it
seems
only
the
sdcns
realize
how
much
baseball
is
a
team
game
combining
efforts
from
every
player
for
the
win
consider
the
red
sox
game
last
night
the
sox
won
in
the
bottom
of
the
who
won
the
game
clemens
pitched
a
strong
nine
innings
allowing
only
two
runs
ryan
pitched
a
couple
shutout
innings
though
he
needed
some
excellent
defensive
plays
behind
him
to
do
so
quantrill
pitched
a
couple
of
innings
gave
up
the
goahead
run
and
got
credited
with
the
win
when
the
sox
scored
two
in
the
bottom
of
the
inning
looks
like
a
team
effort
to
me
yet
only
quantrill
got
credit
for
the
win
how
about
the
offense
dawson
and
vaughn
hit
i
think
hrs
early
in
the
game
without
either
one
the
sox
would
have
lost
in
nine
quintana
led
off
the
with
a
solid
single
zupcic
pinchran
for
quintana
providing
the
speed
to
go
from
first
to
third
when
cooper
ripped
a
second
single
in
the
inning
melvin
avoided
the
dp
getting
the
run
home
with
a
sac
fly
not
much
of
a
help
but
it
was
something
scrub
richardson
then
hit
a
double
scoring
the
speedy
cooper
all
the
way
from
first
hills
lack
of
defense
helped
cooper
and
zupcic
were
credited
with
runs
melvin
and
richardson
were
credited
with
rbis
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
quintanas
hit
that
set
up
the
whole
inning
and
did
melvin
really
contribute
as
much
as
richardson
furthermore
people
seem
to
consider
rbis
to
be
more
significant
than
runs
did
melvin
contribute
more
than
cooper
cooper
provided
the
gamewinning
baserunner
and
moved
the
tying
run
to
third
base
with
only
one
out
assigning
credit
based
on
runs
and
rbis
is
clearly
ridiculous
you

i
guess
i
dont
understand
your
question
i
was
trying
to
imply
that
the
accusations
of
glenn
davis
malingering
were
certainly
not
played
up
very
much
still
if
the
whispers
reached
san
francisco
it
is
certainly
possible
they
were
stronger
elsewhere
also
it
was
teammates
making
the
aspersions
in
any
event
i
know
of
no
other
player
to
be
maligned
in
the
last
couple
years
but
in
any
case
i
believe
mike
lavalliere
has
been
accused
of
poor
work
habits
and
general
sloth
recently
probably
not
malingering
just
as
he
was
being
released
its
interesting
that
nobody
heard
much
about
these
problems
before
if
they
were
so
important
i
have
heard
sanders
called
many
things
as
well
i
have
not
heard
him
called
lazy
given
the
phenomenon
it
would
be
difficult
to
label
him
as
such
exactly
so
which
means
his
media
detractors
have
had
to
say
other
things
about
him
i
believe
its
a
general
phenomenon
that
if
writers
dont
like
you
theyll
find
a
label
that
will
stick
no
matter
who
you
are
i
find
myself
more
interested
in
the
selection
of
labels
than
in
why
writers
feel
they
need
to
act
this
way
not
that
this
fascinates
me
that
much
either
uh
the
original
authors
point
was
that
black
and
white
players
were
por
trayed
differently
by
the
media
and
towards
this
he
gave
a
highly
selected
list
to
prove
his
case
sanders
name
showed
up
eventually
i
dispute
that
sanders
has
ever
been
called
lazy
by
the
media
hmm
big
ego
possible
club
house
disturbance
etc
is
that
good
press
no
but
it
isnt
the
total
extent
of
the
press
he
received
in
pittsburgh
where
he
was
called
all
kinds
of
things
including
lazy
and
spoiled
by
the
local
columnists
again
the
actual
words
used
may
shift
around
with
time
and
expediency
but
lazy
tends
to
be
higher
on
the
list
for
nonwhite
players
at
least
in
my
subjective
opinion
aside
it
might
be
interesting
for
somebody
to
do
an
archival
study
on
player
descriptions
before
and
after
the
color
barrier
was
broken
and
on
teams
like
the
red
sox
which
have
been
traditionally
white
nowadays
most
people
think
of
carl
yastrzemski
as
one
of
those
bluecollar
hardworking
guys
but
in
the
early
he
was
often
portrayed
as
a
lazy
bum
really
hmm
i
never
heard
anyone
accuse
canseco
of
being
lazy
nor
sierra
ive
heard
accusations
that
canseco
was
a
bad
fielder
but
could
be
a
great
one
if
he
put
his
mind
to
it
ignoring
whether
or
not
he
is
a
actually
dave
stewart
is
was
one
of
the
most
vocal
about
this
in
any
event
that
is
not
lazy
at
least
one
poster
in
the
last
week
has
fired
off
a
major
screed
on
the
cansecoislazy
issue
so
i
think
your
point
is
at
best
a
quibble
and
probably
weaker
than
that
uh
that
poster
specifically
stated
allow
me
to
be
the
first
it
is
not
a
quibble
then
to
state
that
the
media
did
not
portray
canseco
as
being
lazy
if
the
other
person
chooses
to
so
accuse
him
after
my
post
that
does
not
make
it
a
quibble
and
in
fact
the
media
around
here
tended
to
play
up
his
time
in
the
wieght
room
hardly
lazy
and
hardly
a
quibble
have
you
ever
seen
any
mediot
portray
canseco
as
lazy
unconcerned
with
his
fielding
yes
lazy
no
bad
fielder
i
think
this
is
still
interesting
for
that
matter
i
think
cansecos
colorful
offfield
antics
get
lots
more
national
attention
than
those
of
say
roger
clemens
well
hes
had
a
few
more
of
them
at
least
more
that
youve
heard
about
i
think
one
of
the
questions
here
surrounds
selective
reporting
having
said
that
i
have
to
say
that
the
selective
reporting
hypothesis
has
the
potential
to
be
unfalsifiable
at
least
by
those
of
us
who
arent
reporters
police
or
private
investigators
well
canseco
has
been
involved
in
several
felonies
including
his
highspeed
record
carrying
concealed
firearms
and
of
course
the
domestic
violence
clemens
had
a
runin
at
a
bar
canseco
had
that
as
well
and
in
both
cases
the
coverage
was
relatively
minimal

uh
if
the
only
evidence
offered
is
anecdotal
how
can
it
be
objected
that
the
counter
to
it
is
also
anecdotal
and
it
seems
like
everybody
who
has
ever
won
a
batting
title
among
others
has
been
accused
at
some
time
of
caring
more
for
his
own
stats
than
for
the
good
of
the
team
it
also
seems
to
me
that
youre
kirby
puckett
i
have
never
heard
this
accusation
made
of
puckett
i
have
heard
it
of
boggs
actually
i
believe
it
of
him
but
thats
another
matter
not
living
in
minnesota
i
cant
say
whether
or
not
this
line
has
ever
been
used
against
kirby
there
as
far
as
boggs
goes
im
not
sure
why
you
bring
him
up
since
hes
one
of
the
obvious
prototypes
for
the
line
i
quoted
along
with
ted
williams
rod
carew
and
many
others
uh
yes
and
i
agree
with
your
assesment
of
boggs
rather
specifically
however
you
did
say
everybody
who
has
ever
won
a
batting
title
has
been
accused
of
selfishness
i
have
not
ever
anywhere
heard
this
said
of
puckett
pendleton
either
similarly
brett
b
williams
and
others
how
about
daryl
strawberry
and
i
think
the
plus
or
minus
refers
more
to
the
born
again
types
ie
butler
and
gaetti
again
you
seem
to
be
making
an
argument
from
anecdotes
on
the
other
hand
my
argument
by
is
of
the
becausejonsaysso
variety
if
we
have
no
other
data
i
have
to
admit
i
have
problems
generating
lists
of
nonwhite
players
who
became
infamous
for
their
religious
or
political
beliefs
while
names
like
butler
gaetti
dravecky
knepper

al

there

should

as
not

running

what

certainly
werent
going

hirschbeck

needed
him

he

was
it
just
me
or
did
it
look

pointed
to
the

before
calling
that

i
thought
thats
why

made
the

fairly
likely

i

an

might
have
gotten
gant
tossed
altogether
but
if
hirschbeck
had
let
gant
step
out
the
whole
incident
probably
would
have
been
avoided
your
listing
pretty
much
agreed
with
what
i
saw
with
the
aforementioned
addendums
perhaps
it
appeared
differently
at
the
ballpark
personally
i
was
amazed
that
gant
didnt
get
ejected
but
thats
why
cox
did
its
called
protecting
your
players
and
to
those
people
who
would
have
thrown
everyone
out
of
the
game
all
i
can
say
is
that
youd
be
making
baseball
history
even
in
the
worst
baseball
brawls
usually
only
the
major
instigators
are
ejected
not
everyone
who
comes
onto
the
field
and
id
have
to
say
that
those
brawls
are
considerably
more
threatening
to
the
game
than
what
the
braves
did
fri
night
anyhow
thats
my
last
two
cents
on
the
subject
barring
outrageous
postings
i
will
try
to
keep
my
eyes
open

more
incidents

at
least
i
dont
think
so
his
fielding
is
horrendous
at
maybe
hed
be
good
at
short
he
cant
his
the
curve
at
all
and
i
think
all
his
trips
from
new
york
to
columbus
and
back
have
demoralized
him
to
the
point
that
he
just
doesnt
care
get
rid
of
him
i
saythe
sooner
the
better
for
both
the
yanks
and
velarde
keith
keller
lets
go
rangers
velarde
hasnt
been
to
columbus
if
i
recall
for
about
three
years
granted
he
hasnt
been
a
full
time
player
but
when
he
does
play
ive
always
thought
he
had
a
good
bat
he
might
be
demoralized
about
not
playing
full
time
but
he
hasnt
been
shuttled
around
i
think
hes
been
in
new
york
ever
since
he
had
hits
in
ab
back
in
or
i
believe
i
dont
think
he
is
gold
glove
calibre
but
he
doesnt
boot
it
around
either
i
think
if
velarde
is
given
a
chance
he
could
become
extremely
productive
i
dont
have
any
stats
to
back
this
up
and
i
dont
know
if
his
defense
would
cost
any
games
but
i
think
he
could
help
and
he
has
this
year
he
has
hr
already
same
goes
for
jim
leyrtiz
he
has
a
big
mouth
but
he
does
get
the
job
done
when
he
concentrates
i
think
the
situation
with
leyritz
is
that
he
believes
he
is
a
potential
superstar
and
he
gets
pissed
about
not
playing
i
think
he
might
have
realized
something
when
the
marlins
or
rockies
didnt
select
him
the
yanks
need
to
worry
about

rule
states
it
is
interference
by
a
batter

runner
when
in
running
the
last
half
of
the
distance
from
home
base
to
first
base
he
runs
outside

threefoot

inside

left
of
the
foul
line
and
in
the
umpires
judgment
interferes
with
the
field
er
taking
the
throw
at
first
base
the
key
word
in
the
rule
is
and
a
runner
isnt
out
just
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the
ball
or
throw
or
fielding
of
the
throw
to
first
because
the
catcher
opted
to
throw
the
ball
over
the
batterrunners
head
theres
no
inter
ference
sorry
i
still
dont
buy
it
youre
certainly
right
that
the
runner
is
not
out
merely
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
he
must
interfere
with
the
play
but
the
argument
here
is
over
what
constitutes
interference
you
certainly
cannot
infer
from
what
youve
quoted
that
the
batterrunner
must
be
hit
by
the
ball
to
be
guilty
of
interference
you
havent
posted
a
definition
of
interference
at
all
imo
this
calls
for
one
of
the
approved
rulings
that
go
in
small
print
in
the
rulebook
something
like
approved
ruling
if
in
the
judgement
of
the
umpire
the
runner
by
running
to
the
left
of
the
allowed
path
caused
the
fielder
to
make
a
bad
throw
blocks
the
vision
of
the
fielder
receiving
the
throw
or
otherwise
impedes
the
defensive
teams
making
a
play
on
him
the
batterrunner
shall
be
judeged
guilty
of
interference
or
approved
ruling
the
runner
cannot
be
judged
guilty
of
interference
in
the
unless
he
makes
contact
with
a
fielder
or
is
hit
by
the
thrown
ball
in
the

of
such

put

after

was
up
i
read
in

today
sports
section
that
he
is
on
for
surgery
to
repair
broken
toe
and
was
wondering
if
that
was
new
i
thought
he
was
just
letting
it
heal
another
question
is
derek
lilliquist
the
main
closer
for
the
indians
now
that
olin
is
gone
i
need
to
know
cause
i
need
to
find
a
reliever
to
replace
wetteland
and
so
far
lilliquist
is
doing
ok
any
information
on
either
of
the
players
would

you

if

will
notice
the

stat
wise
were
in

probably
came

a

an
equally
great
number
of
great
hitters
and
fielders
also
how
do
you
know
which
ones
do
you
consider
great
about
fielding
the
gloves
were
much
smaller
than
they
are
now
in
the
early
years
of

maybe
a
hitter
like
sheffield
with
the
ba
and
rbieven
though
it
was
probably
a
fluke
year
can
be
compared
to
a
mantle
because
the
pitching
sheffield
faces
is
faster
and
not
to

better
the
so
sheffield
also
has
better

you

if
you
want

try
choosing

from

matt

that
he
will
not

for
good

he
wont
take

rather
swing

why
would
i
groove
a

have

hit

i

williams
will
swing

or
at

not

very
well
at

matts
problem
is
really
more
ability
than
attitude
it
isnt
that
hes
got
it
in
his
mind
that
he
wants
to
swing
away
but
rather
that
hes
still
a
total
sucker
for
the
curve
ball
it
looked
for
a
while
in
that
he
was
getting
better
but
its
still
his
weak
point
as
to
whether
it
does
him
any
good
to
have
bonds
behind
him
the
netstatmavens
will
probably
tell
you
theres
no
reason
that
it
should
but
if
he
thinks
it
will
it
might
be
a
selffulfilling
prophecy
as
to
whether
the
giants
lineup
is
optimal
who
knows
batting
bonds
the

best

fifth
does
seem
to
be
odd
but
the

hitters
arent

so
they
arent
giving
much
up
there
and
although
clark
isnt
the
overall
offensive
force
that

is
he
seems
better
suited
to
the
spot
assuming
of
course
that
he

hi
there
im
german
and
i
have
been
into
this
mlb
stuff
since
almost
one
year
now
there
are
many
problems
occuring
for
me
one
of
them
is
the
era
statistic
for
pitchers
what
does
it
say
era
indicates
the
average
number
of
earned
runs
attributed
to
a
pitcher
per
nine
inning
game
thus
if
a
pitcher
pitched
innings
and
gave
up
earned
run
his
inning
equivelent
perfomance
would
be
earned
runs
thus
his
era
is
to
compute
the
era
you
simply
take
the
number
of
earned
runs
divided
by
the
innings
pitched
and
then
multiple
the
result
by
era
erip
i
think
there
is
another
formula
for
era
i
heard
something
about
it
last
year
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
im
gonna
give
it
a
stab
it
allows
for
a
pitcher
to
pitch
more
than
innings
at
a
time
and
not
benefit
cuz
it
uses
outs
recorded
instead
of
innings
pitched
era
recorded
like
i
said
im
not
sure
this
is
exactly
it
but
im
pretty
sure
they
changed
it
to
something
of
the
sort
an
earned
run
is
run
that
is
given
up
by
the
pitcher
that
is
not
attributed
to
a
fielding
error
more
specifically
if
an
error
occurs
that
represented
the
third
out
all
runs
scored
after
the
error
are
considered
unearned
runs
earned
runs
are
also
runs
scored
as
a
result
of
players
who
were
left
on
base
when
the
pitcher
exited
the
game
here
are
some
examples
if
there
are
two
outs
in
an
inning
and
there
are
men
on
base
if
an
error
occurs
that
represents
the
third
out
all
of
the
runs
after
this
error
and
not
counted
as
earned
runs
if
a
pitcher
issues
some
base
on
balls
walks
and
leaves
the
game
before
the
inning
is
completed
he
is
responsible
for
the
people
who
were
left
on
base
if
the
those
runners
who
were
left
on
base
score
and
the
score
was
not
a
result
of
an
error
those
eraned
runs
are
attributed
to
the
pitcher
who
left
the
game

is

now
that

ten

which
is
extending

ms
nichols
thinks

me

more

i
dont

to

i
get
a

more
from
shortening
the

pitcher
after

comes
in

a
couple
more
still
from
enforcing
existing
rules
which
have
been
stated
in

posts
in

and
other

ones
the
problem
is
who
decides
whether
that

is
wasted
you
dont
seem
to
think
it
is
at
all
right
now
i
think
it
is
although
i
have
heard
one

favoring
giving
the

all
the

he
thinks
he
needs
the

who
knows
if
the
rules
get

maybe
something
i

you

records
in

form
for

game
for
the

and
wrote
a
computer
program
to
calculate
every
major
league
players
contribution
using
it
it
works
like
this
look
at
every
situation
in
every
game
in
a
baseball
season
a
situation
is
determined
by
inning
score
where
the
baserunners
are
and
how
many
outs
there
are
for
each
situation
count
how
many
times
the
team
eventually
won
the
game
that
the
situation
occured
in
and
divide
by
the
number
of
times
the
situation
came
up
to
come
up
with
a
value
for
that
situation
this
was
first
done
by

the

smallsample
anomalies
that
other

have
worried
about
he
reported
this
in

with
john
thorn
gary
skoog
modified
the
method
a
bit
and
did
some
work
on
what
he
called
a
value
added
measure
based
on
these
situational
values
his
were
based
directly
on
marginal
runs
though
not
on
win
probabilities
these
results
as
applied
to
the
season
were
reported
in
one
of
the
bill
james

abstract
books
help
me
out
here
somebody
for
example
a
situation
might
be
inning
score
runner
on
second
and
no
outs
there
were
regular
season
major
league
games
last
year
with
the
rockies
and
marlins
there
will
be
more
this
year
say
this
situation
came
up
in
of
those
and
the
team
ahead
won
of
them
then
the
value
of
this
situation
is
description
of
method
look
at
change
in
win
probability
based
on
the
at
bat
plus
any
baserunning
and
creditdebit
the
player
by
that
amount
each
time
he
gets
a
plate
appearance
now
for
each
player
sum
up
all
his
atbat
and
baserunning
values
for
the
season
to
obtain
an
overall
value
for
that
player
obviously
the
sum
of
all
players
values
for
each
game
and
for
the
season
as
a
whole
will
be
thats
only
because
you
always
credit
x
to
the
batter
and
x
to
the
pitcher
theres
no
validation
involved
ok
theres
a
very
big
problem
here
that
nobody
has
yet
commented
on
youre
adding
probabilities
and
probabilities
dont
add
runs
you
can
add
the
total
team
runs
breaks
down
into
how
many
runs
joe
contributed
plus
how
many
runs
fred
contributed
etc
but
probabilities
dont
work
that
way
if
bob
increases
his
teams
chance
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
that
does
not
mean
that
bob
increased
his
teams
chance
of
winning
by
in
fact
it
doesnt
mean
anything
because
the
units
are
screwy
i
agree
and
disagree
john
is
saying
that
the
batters
efforts
will
result
in
more
wins
then
losses
while
you
are
probably
correct
that
does
not
mean
more
wins
then
losses
it
means
something
i
would
rather
have
a
player
who
increased
my
teams
chances
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
then
i
would
a
player
who
increased
my
chances
of
winning
by
in
each
of
pas
thus
there
appears
to
me
to
be
an
obvious
positive
association
between
johns
statistic
and
winning
games
thus
before
you
disregard
this
stat
it
appears
to
me
that
further
study
must
go
into
what
sort
of
relationship
there
is
consider
an
example
bob
hits
a
solo
hr
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
about
on
your
scale
he
does
the
same
thing
again
in
the
fourth
with
the
score
tied
for
another
and
again
in
the
seventh
with
the
score
tied
for
another
and
finally
in
the
ninth
to
win
the
game
by
a
score
of
for
a
value
of
bob
hit
solo
hr
in
plate
appearances
and
was
credited
by
your
method
with
but
what
does
that
mean
was
bob
responsible
for
the
win
certainly
not
the
defense
is
always
responsible
if
you
include
pitching
in
that
and
bob
wasnt
pitching
in
fact
bob
was
only
of
the
offense
which
is
a
lot
but
not
even
close
to
furthermore
what
about
the
other
team
runs
say
they
all
came
on
solo
hr
by
fred
then
fred
was
hitting
hr
to
tie
up
the
game
which
are
just
as
valuable
as
hr
to
take
the
lead
see
lindsey
and
fred
will
himself
have
accrued
a
good
rating
or
so
so
fred
and
bob
combined
have
amassed
of
a
win
in
one
game
theres
clearly
a
problem
here
the
only
problem
here
is
an
insistance
that
these
number
mean
exactly
how
many
wins
the
team
has
first
we
are
using
averages
over
many
seasons
and
applying
them
to
one
game
second
remember
some
players
performance
take
away
from
the
chance
of
you
winning
that
is
a
player
who
gets
an
out
gets
a
negative
probability
in
most
cases
thus
im
not
sure
in
any
given
game
when
you
add
up
all
the
numbers
for
a
team
who
won
that
they
will
add
up
to
in
that
game
sometimes
they
will
add
up
to
more
then
one
sometime
less
than
one
also
the
pitchers
bad
performances
giving
up
runs
may
have
given
them
a
large
negative
percentage
for
that
game
also
any
batter
that
pulled
an
night
would
give
large
negatives
greg
thinking
about
the
right
things
but
his
intuition
is
off
the
mark
closers
are
enormously
important
the
total
number
of
runs
value
is
outweighed
by
when
they
come
or
are
prevented
from
comming
the
doubling
which
greg
allows
is
not
enough
in
another
article
i
proposed
a
test
of
this
we
can
predict
a
teams
wonlost
record
quite
accurately
by
looking
at
how
many
runs
total
they
score
and
allow
without
regard
to
when
those
runs
score
in
the
game
if
late
runs
are
really
more
important
than
early
runs
then
looking
only
at
late
runs
should
lead
to
a
better
predictor
right
no
but
really
only
because
you
have
a
smaller
sample
size
i
would
think
however
that
the
number
of
runs
you
score
in
the
first
inning
would
be
just
as
good
as
a
prediction
as
how
many
runs
you
score
in
the
last
inning
and
realize
something
else
a
closer
usually
comes
in
in
a
close
situation
not
a
blow
out
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
any
runs
that
a
closer
gives
up
in
a
game
have
equal
importance
to
those
given
up
in
the
first
inning
look
a
closer
giving
up
runs
often
means
a
team
will
lose
many
games
on
the
other
hand
a
starter
who
gives
up
runs
often
still
leaves
his
team
a
chance
to
win
the
offence
has
many
more
outs
to
do
something
about
but
i
am
not
saying
all
late
inning
situations
are
equally
important
either
if
i
am
down
runs
in
the
ninth
it
really
does
not
matter
how
many
runs
my
pitcher
gives
up
in
the
ninth
heres
another
thought
experiment
apply
this
method
to
basketball
what
you
find
is
that
points
scored
in
the
first
half
of
the
game
have
almost
exactly
no
value
because
no
lead
is
safe
with
an
entire
half
yet
to
play
furthermore
the
sub
in
off
the
bench
who
sinks
the
winning
free
throws
with
no
time
on
the
clock
gets
a
for
the
game
while
the
star
forward
who
scored
points
in
the
first
half
before
spraining
his
ankle
gets
a
zero
does
this
make
sense
no
but
why
would
you
assume
that
the
teams
probability
of
winning
would
be
before
the
possesion
in
which
the
free
throws
were
made
look
if
you
are
down
point
with
seconds
left
there
is
a
fairly
high
probability
that
you
will
win
the
game
if
you
are
in
possesion
of
the
ball
and
do
not
forget
that
somebody
elses
missed
shots
turnovers
fouls
bad
defense
etc
caused
a
negative
chance
that
the
team
would
win
from
reading
all
of
the
discussion
on
this
statistic
i
feel
that
those
who
critisize
it
to
a
certain
extent
are
doing
so
out
of
an
agenda
at
first
look
this
statistic
valadates
clutchness
but
it
really
does
not
cluthness
revolves
around
the
idea
that
certain
players
in
crucial
situation
elevate
their
performance
and
others
performance
goes
down
ive
never
seen
convincing
proof
that
this
really
happens
so
if
you
assume
there
is
no
clutchness
then
that
means
that
except
for
a
lot
of
noice
this
statistic
has
a
positive
association
to
player
performance
there
is
a
way
to
get
rid
of
the
noice
if
you
do
not
believe
in
clutchness
certainly
we
could
find
out
what
the
average
value
of
a
home
run
is
for
example
we
may
find
for
instance
that
a
home
run
increases
your
chance
of
winning
by
on
average
while
a
strikeout
decreases
your
chance
of
winning
by
i
bet
if
this
were
done
we
would
find
that
this
statistic
was
just
as
good
as
other
statistics
we
have
for
predicting
wins
and
losses
how
do
we
evaluate
relief
pitchers
say
john
and
sam
have
the
exact
same
pitching
statistics
runs
earned
runs
ks
bbs
etc
both
had
exceptional
numbers
john
however
only
pitched
in
closer
situations
while
sam
was
a
mop
up
man
who
was
more
valuble
to
their
team
probably
john
who
was
the
better
pitcher
they
were
probably

theres
a

of
whining
about
how

players
are
overpaid
i
thought
id
put
together
an

team
that
could
win
a

i
splurged
and
let
four
of
the
players
earn
as
much
as
half
a
million
dollars
the
highestpaid
player
is
frank
thomas
at
i
cut
some
players
like
kenny
lofton
chris
hoiles
keith
mitchell
tim
wakefield
and
a
bunch
of
pitchers
all
of
whom
could
have
arguably
made
the
team
better
at
a
cost
of
million
for
the
lot
of
them
the
total
team
salary
is
averaging
slightly
over
a
player
if
thats
too
steep
you
can
dump
thomas
and
bagwell
replacing
them
with
paul
sorrento
and
a
minimum
wager
to
save
a

this
year
chuck
klein
is
starting
to
hit
very
well
and
he
lashed
a
double
into
a
gap
in
rightcenter
cool
papa
bells
speed
allowed
him
to
cut
the
ball
off
and
prevent
schmidt
from
scoring
nellie
fox
was
walked
and
bob
boone
grounded
out
to
second
ending
the
threat
teams
are
starting
to
realize
that
you
dont
have
to
pitch
to
schmidt
or
torrienti
and
that
is
lowering
their
run
total
it
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
klein
and
dick
allen
who
platoons
with
chuck
klein
and
occasionally
spells
rose
at
first
and
its
a
credit
to
the
phillies
that
theyve
been
able
to
sustain
their
pace
the
picthers
have
slumped
at
times
so
came
the
analysis
from
frank
chance
the
cubs
got
that
run
back
when
bell
bunted
for
a
hit
thomas
grounder
moved
him
to
second
and
after
sandberg
made
out
billy
williams
singled
home
a
run
in
the
sixth
ron
santo
launched
a
tworun
homer
to
make
it
dick
redding
got
in
trouble
in
the
eighth
as
schmidt
singled
and
klein
singled
him
to
third
ed
reulbach
entered
to
face
fox
but
dick
allen
popped
out
of
the
dugout
to
hit
allen
doubled
to
right
but
luckily
for
the
cubs
williams
had
moved
to
left
and
andre
dawson
had
been
inserted
for
defense
he
fired
a
bullet
to
home
plate
to
keep
klein
at
third
lance
parrish
hitting
for
boone
was
walked
and
bruce
sutter
entered
larry
bowa
grounded
into
a
double
play
but
ed
delahanty
walked
as
a
pinchhitter
desiring
a
strikeout
since
ashburn
was
likely
to
attempt
a
bunt
hit
with
the
quick
trillo
pinchrunning
at
third
chance
brought
in
lee
smith
who
induced
a
popup
to
the
catcher
from
the
speedy
centerfielder
ending
the
inning
the
cubs
took
the
win
moving
a
game
behind
the
phillies
steve
carlton
was
called
upon
to
battle
brown
saturday
to
get
another
righthander
in
the
lineup
ron
santo
moved
to
first
and
bill
madlock
played
third
unfortunately
brown
allowed
six
doubles
and
the
cub
bullpen
was
worn
down
even
more
as
the
cubs
tried
to
maintain
a
lead
against
lefty
madlock
batting
sixth
had
knocked
two
doubles
of
his
own
driving
home
four
runs
gabby
hartnett
hit
two
home
runs
and
cuyler
added
another
and
the
score
was
cubs
after
six
innings
the
phillie
bullpen
had
more
troubles
in
the
bottom
of
the
eighth
as
the
cubs
grabbed
more
runs
to
ice
an
triumph
sundays
twin
bill
saw
cool
papa
bell
gather
seven
straight
hits
at
one
point
including
a
rare
outsidethepark
home
run
in
the
second
game
off
robin
roberts
grover
alexander
of
the
phils
took
the
first
contest
but
the
cubs
captured
the
second
one
with
waddell
gaining
the
win
bruce
sutter
tossed
two
innings
for
the
save
though
he
allowed
one
run
in
the
eighth
the
cardinals
stood
half
a
game
behind
these
coleaders
and
would
conclude
their
series
with
the
expos
on
monday
montreal
at
st
louisaugust
tie
for
dennis
martinez
is
on
a
roll
and
he
continued
it
versus
john
tudor
friday
the
expos
have
a
wide
variety
of
hitters
and
while
they
arent
among
the
alltime
greats
they
are
getting
the
job
done
after
winning
their
first
first
two
games
they
suddenly
found
themselves
only
games
out
of
first
in
this
wacky
season
martinez
triumphed
on
friday
and
williams
outdueled
dizzy
dean
saturday
however
the
cardinals
refused
to
give
up
winning
on
sunday
the
cards
captured
mondays
game
too
as
steve
carlton
outdueled
steve
rogers
were
really
good
against
ground
ball
pitchers
because
of
our
team
speed
remarked
lou
brock
i
dont
see
why
we
cant
win
this
division
the
phillies
and
cubs
may
have
some
reasons
for
them
twothirds
of
the
way
through
the
season
there
is
a
tie
for
first
new
york
at
pittsburghaugust
straight
wins
for
bucs
now
back
but
in
when
your
team
is
in
a
slump
like
we
are
the
worst
thing
is
to
play
in
a
pitchers
park
like
this
spoke
gil
hodges
before
the
series
keith
hernandez
added
that
their
defense
takes
away
quite
a
few
runs
per
year
and
it
must
be
giving
them
an
extra
wins
the
pirates
have
made
only
errors
all
season
ahead
of
the
second
place
dodgers
error
totals
tend
to
be
around
for
the
best
defensive
alltime
teams
rube
foster
defeated
sid
fernandez
friday
and
candelaria
outshone
seaver
saturday
in
a
game
featuring
some
outstanding
defense
when
nolan
ryan
and
two
relivers
the
mets
in
another
win
sunday
the
pirates
could
once
again
look
forward
to
a
victory
getting
them
back
to
the
mark
they
had
been
unable
to
several
times
in
the
past
month
bert
blyleven
met
dwight
gooden
in
the
afternoon
game
both
pitchers
possessed
fantastic
stuff
and
the
only
runs
scored
through
eight
innings
were
on
home
runs
a
solo
shot
by
rusty
staub
of
the
mets
and
a
tworun
blast
by
ralph
kiner
for
the
pirates
the
mets
darryl
strawberry
singled
home
a
run
in
the
top
of
the
ninth
off
jesse
orosco
working
his
second
inning
after
mookie
wilson
pinchran
for
gary
carter
at
second
with
one
out
and
a
runner
on
first
lee
mazilli
was
sent
in
to
pinchhit
the
pirates
countered
with
kent
tekulve
placing
him
in
the
fifth
spot
in
the
order
and
putting
barry
bonds
in
left
field
as
the
ninth
place
hitter
tekulve
induced
a
groundout
forcing
strawberry
at
second
he
slid
hard
into
honus
wagner
preventing
the
pirates
from
turning
their
fifth
double
play
of
the
afternoon
tekulve
allowed
a
hit
but
clemente
threw
mazilli
out
at
third
from
near
the
right
field
line
ending
the
inning
tug
mcgraw
relieved
randy
myers
who
entered
to
pitch
the
eighth
and
got
one
out
before
bonds
launched
a
rocket
to
deep
center
running
through
the
stop
sign
at
third
to
score
an
insidethepark
homer
to
win
the
pirates
had
scored
an
improbable
straight
wins
and
had
moved
to
within
games
of
first
place
with
seven
weeks
to
go

another
sunday
doubleheader
appeared
on
the
schedule
as
the
giants
managed
to
close
the
gap
on
the
other
teams
thanks
to
some
starting
pitching
that
just
wouldnt
tire
in
fact
reported
manager
john
mcgraw
once
this
rough
part
of
the
schedule
is
over
maybe
as
early
as
this
coming
week
we
may
shift
to
a
rotation
again
for
a
little
while
juan
marichal
continued
his
hot
pitching
friday
beating
lew
burdette
and
the
braves
willie
mays
had
all
four
rbis
on
hits
rick
reuschel
faced
joe
niekro
saturday
in
a
slugfest
the
braves
park
had
been
a
homer
haven
but
this
took
the
cake
as
the
giants
won
a
seesaw
affair
willie
mays
had
three
homers
willie
mccovey
eddie
matthews
and
don
baylor
had
two
and
hank
aaron
ernie
lombardi
biz
mackey
and
mel
ott
had
one
each
the
braves
had
collected
home
runs
going
into
sundays
doubleheader
putting
them
on
a
pace
for
which
would
be
short
of
the
national
league
record
they
were
still
a
tad
behind
the
yankees
pace
they
had
allowed
over
though
vida
blue
actually
got
the
win
after
retiring
batters
in
the
fifth
he
allowed
only
a
run
in
the
sixth
but
faltered
in
the
seventh
joe
mcginnity
earned
the
save
in
the
doubleheader
the
braves
hoyt
wilhelm
failed
to
hold
a
lead
in
the
first
game
but
hank
aaron
homered
off
bill
foster
in
the
eighth
as
the
braves
won
the
giants
took
the
second
game
however
by
a
score
the
homer
by
aaron
was
a
magical
by
the
braves
however
they
fell
to
three
game
below
making
a
comeback
extremely
unlikely
san

at
cincinnatiaug
randy
jones
faced
ewell
blackwell
in
the
first
of
this
series
and
the
padres
felt
rather
good
with
don
mattingly
straining
his
back
in
the
last
cleveland
game
the
trade
looked
even
better
mcgriffs
batting
average
was
even
rising
of
course
the
bench
was
very
poor
and
joe
gordon
was
only
adequate
in
the
outfield
but
these
were
minor
problems
since
the
pitching
was
holding
up
jones
pitched
a
good
game
friday
and
won
mcgriff
launched
two
home
runs
mel

earned
a
win
with
the

saturday
was
the
final
score
tom
candiotti
battled
satchel
paige
to
a
tie
through
eight
innings
before
departing
the
game
was
scoreless
for
more
innings
until
the
thirteenth
paige
had
departed
after
and
john
franco
hurled
a
scoreless
inning
tom
browning
was
working
his
second
scoreless
inning
when
dave
winfield
doubled
with
one
out
and
joe
gordon
was
pitched
around
thurm
munson
doubled
both
runners
home
and
the

gamed
a
win
the
threegame
sweep
had
pulled
the
giants
into
a
tie
with
the
reds
though
the
reds
denied
it
the
highly
emotional
series
with
the
dodgers
may
have
taken
too
much
out
of
them
brookangeles
at
houstonaugust
another
series
capped
off
by
a
weekend
doubleheader
took
place
in
the
wide
open
plains
of
the
astrodome
the
astros
sent
joe
niekro
to
the
hill
in
the
first
game
opposite
don
drysdale
normally
drysdale
remarked
i
would
be
challenging
hitter
by
being
ready
to
throw
at
them
i
cant
afford
to
with
this
team
though
we
have
to
get
our
own
runners
going
we
cant
afford
to
let
the
astros
beat
us
he
then
winked
and
said
well
maybe
davis
will
get
decked
once
the
fact
that
glenn
davis
leads
the
team
in
homers
with
six
is
primarily
why
he
would
be
decked
but
it
should
be
understood
that
his
current
pace
would
give
him
nine
for
the
season
the
hitting
on
this
team
is
a
little
better
but
the
power
is
all
doubles
and
triples
still
carl
furillo
is
the
main
reason
no
astro
home
runs
were
hit
over
the
weekend
as
he
threw
two
runners
out
trying
for
insidethepark
homers
for
those
unaware
of
the
nastness
of
the
astros
park
they
have
a
high
gray
wall
all
around
the
outfield
balls
must
be
hit
into
the
seats
to
be
home
runs
the
foul
poles
are
feet
from
home
plate
but
the
alleys
are
feet
away
with
center
field
at
feet
its
as
if
some
threeyearold
threw
a
tantrum
and
told
his
playmates
if
i
cant
hit
home
runs
nobody
will
hit
home
runs
remarked
roy
campanella
the
dodgers
stole
five
bases
friday
but
the
astros
decided
to
revitalize
the
baltimore
chopping
that
had
failed
weeks
before
for
tonight
anyway
davis
jim
wynn
and
jose
cruz
did
not
have
to
mess
with
their
swings
according
to
the
manager
after
poles
and
willie
wells
reached
base
via
the
baltimore
chop
drysdale
decked
jose
cruz
with
a
pitch
he
responded
with
a
tworun
double
but
wynn
playing
first
for
davis
popped
up
and
the
astros
didnt
score
any
more
in
that
inning
they
did
score
in
the
fourth
to
erase
a
deficit
and
the
astros
wound
up
winning
they
threatened
to
do
even
better
the
next
game
as
tommy
john
would
be
their
opponent
walt
alston
met
privately
with
the
starters
at
am
before
the
game
i
think
i
know
how
we
can
beat
the
baltimore
chop
he
explained
how
can
we
do
that
pee
wee
reese
wondered
theyre
going
to
be
beating
the
ball
down
so
weve
got
to
be
ready
to
throw
on
the
run
steve
will
start
at
first
to
dig
balls
out
of
the
dirt
but
i
want
all
of
you
to
practice
your
barehanded
picks
and
throws
well
go
with
a
shallow
infield
almost
the
whole
time
the
plan
almost
worked
mike
scott
allowed
only
two
runs
through
eight
innings
but
the
astros
got
three
two
of
them
scored
when
bill
doran
pushed
a
bunt
into
the
outfield
in
the
fourth
with
runners
on
second
and
third
astros
was
the
final
with
dave
smith
earning
another
save
the
dodgers
scored
a
victory
in
the
first
game
of
the
twin
bill
sunday
as
nolan
ryan
walked
five
three
of
whom
scored
in
a
dodger
win
fernando
valenzuela
lost
the
second
game
to
don
sutton
however
as
the
dodgers
thirteen
stolen
bases
in
the
series
proved
to
not
be
enough
were
mostly
a
power
team
remarked
ron
cey
jackie
and
when
he
plays
maury
wills
are
our
only
real

demons
though
a
couple
other
plays
can
do
it
now
and
then
were
sunk
in
a
place
like
the
astrodome
i
guess
thats
why
theyre
so
successful
there
indeed
it
seems
that

identified

who
was
exposed
to
the

according
to

in

the

section
preceding
his

evaluations
he
valued
nied
at
and
said
that
nieds

as

he
did
catch

anything

what
tripe
the

is
inconsistent

filled
with
selective

james

then
makes
some
absolutely
bizarre

not

that

i
got
the

he

glanced

its

this
is
the
way
it
has
always
been
several
detailed
studies
of
this
have
been
done
and
theyve
all
shown
that
players
arent
coming
up
any
younger
or
older
than
in
the
past
and
they
arent
playing
any
more
or
less
in

than
they
used
to
the
only
thing
that
shifts
is
our
memories
of
the
good
old
days
damn
i
was
afraid
you
would
say
that
but
all
after
the
fact
which
makes
it
not
applicable
to
the
current
discussion
which
is
about
how
you
decide
whether
to
play
the
rookie
who
hasnt
established
himself
in
the
majors
over
the
mediocre
veteran
the
padres
played
santiago
that
year
because
they
clearly
had
nobody
else
worth
playing
well
perhaps
if
the
braves
had
no
one
else
worth
playing
this
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
others
worth
playing
at
least
in
their
opinion
and
i
happen
to
agree
both
of
these
young
men
were
highly
touted
defensive
catchers
expected
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
baseball
not
by
recsportbaseball
consensus
that
may
sound
like
an
incredibly
arrogant
comment
but
ive
found
that
the
sdcn
consensus
when
one
exists
is
right
far
more
often
than
the
media
consensus
or
the
opinions
of
baseball
people
affiliated
with
mlb
i
can
believe
that
im
a
newbie
here
so
ill
take
your
word
but
alomar
is
a
fine
defensive
catcher
which
was
my
statement
above
that
is
a
solid
reason
for
bringing
him
up
at
a
tender
age
as
long
as
they
feel
he
can
also
hit
a
bit
lopez
does
not
have
such
a
consensus
about
his
defensive
prowess
and
imho
that
is
enough
to
give
him
that
dreaded
seasoning
i
dont
know
who
knows
i
suppose
the
same
people
or
similar
who
know
he
will
be
better
than
some
other
catcher
these
are
of
course
just
differing
opinions
i
read
that
his
arm
is
not
that
strong
i
suppose
somewhere
there
is
some
measurement
of
sb
ratios
and
that
he
is
still
learning
to
call
a
game
that
latter
skill
may
be
difficult
to
project
on
someone
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
his
performance
but
it
is
a
tangible
skill
i
disagree
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangible
skill
any
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deny
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catchers
may
be
much
better
than
others
at
it
but
i
really
dont
see
any
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defense
is
eerily
accurate
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defensive
assessments
of
catchers
very
seriously
sorry
new
dont
know
nichols
law
dont
believe
in
catchers
era
but
i
am
interested
in
pitchers
eras
with
different
catchers
any
info
on
that
absolutely
the
evidence
is
piling
up
year
after
year
the
only
other
alternative
is
that
the
braves
really
dont
know
that
their
young
players
are
on
average
better
than
their
current
starters
im
not
ruling
out
that
kind
of
gross
incompetence
but
i
think
the
salaryschedule
explanation
is
more
charitable
in
other
words
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
only
logic
behind
a
different
decision
than
we
would
make
must
be
financial
i
presume
we
feel
this
way
about
other
franchises
than
atlanta
no
consider
we
know
that
the
braves
are
about
the
strongest
team
in
baseball
right
now
even
with
olson
and
lemke
and
nixon
and
bream
in
the
lineup
they
have
as
good
a
chance
of
repeating
as
champs
this
year
as
any
team
ever
has
it
actually
makes
some
sense
to
say
rather
than
making
our
team
marginally
better
this
year
by
bringing
up
the
young
studs
and
dumping
the
elderly
lets
go
ahead
and
compete
this
year
with
what
we
have
and
then
bring
up
the
studs
only
as
we
have
to
so
that
well
still
have
them
under
reserve
three
years
from
now
and
beyond
when
the
current
team
will
be
collecting
pensions
is
it
fair
to
the
young
players
no
does
it
make
organizational
sense
i
think
it
does
well
if
it
does
make
organizational
sense
one
can
hardly
fault
them
for
their
decisions
i
mean
please
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
business
especially
when
im
being
successful
c
i
could
make
it
or
wins
if
you
let
me
bring
up
lopez
s
listen
bobby
id
like
to
but
the
way
i
see
it
if
he
hits
the
big
club
this
year
well
be
paying
megaarbitration
bucks
down
the
road
in
a
couple
of
years
and
theres
no
way
i
want
to
do
that
and
continues
with
we
can
win
without
him
and
then
keep
winning
next
year
with
him
hows
that
im
sure
you
could
be
right
you
could
also
be
smoking
some
illegal
substance
hey
thats
a
joke
dont
get
offended
please
hey
id
love
to
be
wrong
about
this
if
you
think
its
unlikely
id
love
to
know
why
dont
cite
anybodys
innate
ethical
rectitude
though
unless
you
know
them
personally
well
i
cant
cite
anyones
ethical
rectitude
because
i
dont
know
what
it
means
but
again
if
it
makes
organizational
sense
then
so
be
it
baseball
is
a
business
and
if
there
is
a
solid
business
reason
for
keeping
lopez
on
the
farm
then
thats
what
the
braves
should
do
i
happen
to
believe
that
its
a
baseball
decision
while
you
from
your
armchair
may
disagee
i
dont
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
to
suggest
the
decision
they
made
i
predicted
it
among
large
guffaws
from
several
at
the
start
of
spring
training
i
think
it
is
a
very
normal
decision
to
have
made
it
is
certainly
more
reversible
than
to
have
started
lopez
in
the
bigs
and
have
released
one
of
their
catchers
sure
it
may
be
conservative
it
may
also
be
logical
i
dont
know
what
ethics
have
to
do
with
it
seems

i
was
watching
peter
gammons
on
espn
last
night
and
hes
got
me
a
little
confused
while
talking
about
expansion
he
started
mentioning
people
who
might
benefit
from
the
fringe
players
theyll
be
facing
mcgriff
hitting
home
runs
sheffield
getting
rbis
and
glavine
winning
games
this
was
of
course
all
in
reference
to
what
happened
the
other
times
that
baseball
has
expanded
early
late
late
what
really
confused
me
though
was
the
mention
of
al
players
who
would
do
well
next
year
specifically
roger
clemens
winning
games
and
the
likes
of
mcgwire
and
gonzalez
hitting
home
runs
my
question
is
how
in
the
hell
will
the
rockiesmarlins
help
the
al
the
last
time
i
looked
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
talent
jumping
leagues
did
i
miss
something
dennis
cleary
dfclearyucdavisedu
i
wondered
the
same
thing
when
he
first
mentioned
it
i
thought
he
was
just
making
a
mistake
but
then
he
said
it
over
and
over
and
then
in
the
examples
from
other
years
he
gave
stats
for
players
from
both
leagues
even
when
only
one
league
expanded
so
since
stats
never
lie
i
guess
there
is
an
effect
on
both
leagues
because
the
expansion
draft
takes
talent
from
both
leagues
equally
making
every
team
in
both
leagues
dilute
their
major
league
talent
by
calling
up
players
that
normally
they
would
not
have
had
there
not
been
expansion

thinks

might

i
would

give

this

i
have
a

questions
about
my

team
the
minnesota
twins
how
good
does
their
rotation
look
the
last
i
heard
the
order
is
tapani
erikson
mahomes
banks
and
some
guy
ive
never
heard
of
sounds
pretty
pathetic
to
me
well
maybe
it
will
be
banks
is
a
yearold
prospect
who
hasnt
matured
as
quickly
as
they
would
have
liked
mahomes
is
a
yearold
who
is
very
highly
touted
tapani
and
erickson
are
also
young
and
have
looked
very
good
this
spring
the
last
spot
was
between
jim
deshaies
formerly
of
houston
and
sd
and
mike
trombley
deshaies
hasnt
looked
very
good
this
spring
so
i
believe
that
the
spot
has
gone
to
trombley
although
they
hadnt
wanted
starters
this
unproven
i
personally
believe
very
highly
in
mahomes
and
trombley
who
is
playing
short
and
third
well
scott
leius
is
the
shortstop
he
played
mostly
last

was

throw

i
think
that
they
used

to
keep
the

up

not
given
the
job
to
witt

he
was
a

bill
james
had
something
to
do
with
overhyping
the
kid
to
death
au
contraire
he
was
fairly
critical
of
him
after
his
roy
campaign
noting
that
he
wasnt
allworld
as
a
catcher
or
a
hitter
he
called
him
basically
average
when
everyone
else
in
the
media
was
predicting
the
next
johnny
bench
or
roy
campanella
both
of
these
young
men
were
highly
touted
defensive
catchers
expected
to
be
among
the
best
ever
in
baseball
the
reports
i
read
indicate
that
lopez
is
very
ordinary
defensively
which
reports
are
those
the
dodgers
options
are
parrish
and
hernandez
and
now
only
carlos
piazza
is
as
long
as
he
continues
with
his
very
hot
bat
they
will
keep
him
in
the
lineup
because
they
need
the
offensive
production
when
he
cools
off
look
for
the
much
better
defensive
catcher
hernandez
only
to
play
more
i
like
hernandez
a
lot
but
if
piazza
can
catch
the
ball
youve
gotta
play
him
imho
hes
a
much
better
hitter
although
hernandez
isnt
a
bad
hitter
right
now
it
sounds
like
piazza
will
catch
most
of
the
time
and
hernandez
will
be
candiottis
caddy
since
he
can
catch
the
knuckler
as
long
as
they
play
up
to
their
abilities
the
dodgers
could
have
a
very
good
catching
tandem
the
braves
options
are
berryhill
and
olson
i
agree
that
olson
is
nothing
special
but
i
do
think
berryhill
is
better
than
many
people
on
rsb
believe
but
both
the
braves
catchers
are
very
good
defensively
calling
a
game
blocking
the
plate
throwing
and
although
they
are
somewhat
weak
offenivsively
they
play
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
think
both
are
overrated
defensively
see
nichols
law
of
catcher
defense
but
thats
something
thats
difficult
to
prove
or
disprove
from
your
viewpoint
or
mine
about
the
only
tangible
thing
we
can
look
at
is
opponents
sb
and
thats
clouded
by
how
well
your
pitchers
hold
runners
catchers
era
is
a
possibility
but
its
subject
to
way
too
many
biases
as
for
them
playing
on
a
team
that
is
not
so
much
in
need
of
another
big
bat
i
disagree
here
too
about
the
only
chink
in
the
braves
armor
is
that
theyre
weak
offensively
at
several
positions
cf
c
ss
if
belliard
plays
unless
bream

hunter
form

what

they

therefore

you
obviously

the

youre

thompson
and
incaviglia
dont
equal
wins
but
ill
take
the
two
of
them
over
stan
javier
and
ruben
amaro
ab
id
say
this
improvement
should
equate
to
wins
at

then
ill
take
lenny
dykstra
who
played

last
year
and
project
his
numbers
hits
hr
sb
over

hits
sb
okay
now
well
put
these
numbers
in
the
leadoff
hole
and
thus
i
have
to
bump
kruk
hollins
daulton
rbi
numbers
up
just
a

now
lesse
they
knocked
in

respectively
dont
you

its

to
add
about
or
rbi
to
each
they
managed
to
knock
in
a
pretty
nice
amount
of
runs
with
a
leadoff
hitter
okay
bozo
do
you
think
its

to
add
maybe

more
wins
now
oh
and
how
can
i

wes

hr
rbi
even
with
a

and
in
aaa
and
a
horrible
first
half
well
project
that
over
a
full
season
to
get
hr
and
rbi
or
so
is
that
worth
a
win
or
two
finally
take
the
worse

staff
in
the

last

add
the
worse
injury
decimation
of
okay
now
we
add
danny
jackson
some
health
and
a
full

for
schilling
is
that
worth
at

wins
okay
weve
been
conservative
and
added
about
wins
so
far
now
were
adding
about
more
wins
thanks
to
the
expansion
teams
okay
thats

hmmm
i

alomars

mentioning
people

might

from

players
theyll
be
facing
mcgriff

sheffield
getting

this
was

all
in

to
what
happened
the
other
times
that
baseball
has
expanded
early
late
late
what
really
confused
me
though
was
the
mention
of
al
players
who
would
do
well
next
year
specifically
roger
clemens
winning
games
and
the
likes
of
mcgwire
and

hitting

my
question
is
how
in

hell
will
the
rockiesmarlins
help
the
al
the
last

i
looked
there
wasnt
a

did
i
miss
something
only
if
you
persist
in
believing
that
peter

is
more
knowledgable
about

than
the

okay
im
overstating
still
the
man
actually
had
the
gall
to
say
that
one
out
of
every
six
pitchers
in
the
nl
this
year
did
not
pitch
in
the
majors
last
year
huh
imo
this
expansion
will
not
see
the
explosive
jump
in
offense
that
the
other
expansion
drafts
had
since
the
talent
was
diluted
over
both
leagues
in
gammons
defense
because
the
talent
drain
came
from
the
al
as
well
some
increase
will
be
seen
he
also
gets
credit
for
mentioning
that
the
jump
in
offense
was
due
also
to
the

this
is
what
jackson
looked
like
in
with
everything
converted
to
a
neutral
park
on
the
basis
of
run
production
his
equivalent
average
started
at
in
was
up
to
in
and
in
so
let
us
say
he
had
established
in
his
last
two
seasons
a
level
of
play
im
not
quite
sure
how
these
numbers
are
generated
it
appears
that
in
a
neutral
park
bos
hr
and
slugging
tend
to
drop
he
actually
loses
two
home
runs
or
do
they
what
is
equivalent
average
one
thing
when
looking
at
bos
stats
is
that
you
can
see
that
kc
took
away
some
homers
normally
you
expect
some
wouldbe
homers
to
go
for
doubles
or
triples
in
big
parks
or
to
be
caught
and
for
that
matter
you
expect
lots
of
doubles
and
triples
anyway
but
bo
despite
his
speed
hit
very
few
doubles
and
not
that
many
triples
so
i
would
expect
his
value
to
have
risen
quite
considerably
in
a
neutral
park
that
is
good
very
good
in
fact
but
it
probably
doesnt
make
the
top
ten
in
the
league
the
best
eqa
in
the
al
in
was
dave
winfields
thomas
was
first
at

in

nl
was

an
incroyable
tenth
was
bip
roberts
but
is
better
than
any
season
in
the
past
five
years
by
joe
carter
it
is
about
what
mattingly
had
in
what
felix
jose
had
the
last
two
years
just
ahead
of
time
raines
fiveyear
average
better
than
ryan
kleskos
mles
felix
jose
has
been
a
player
in
a
fairly
neutral
park
i
would
offhand
guess
the
bo
at
around
a
player
maybe
not
even
close
he
got
more
attention
from
the
media
than
was
warranted
from
his
baseball
playing
though
his
hype
was
a
lot
better
than
his
hitting
that
is
the
basis
for
the
netcomments
about
him
being
overrated
the
media
would
have
you
beleive
he
was
a
great
hitter
i
think
he
was
a
good
maybe
very
good
hitter
he
was
imo
something
like
the
best
hitter
in
the
majors
id
put
him
about
there
too
note
i
hadnt
realized
the
media
had
hyped
him
so
much
i
thought
he
was
always
viewed
by
them
as
a
better
football
player
and
only
soso
at
baseball
he
did
only
have
one
season
and
kc
wasnt
winning
note
i
maybe
have
harped
on
this
a
bit
in
the
past
but
there
is
a
mistake
being
made
by
the
sdcns
as
they
are
known
on
this
group
with
respect
to
players
like
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
and
perhaps
others
we
find
that
if
you
look
at
a
large
group
of
players
their
past
major
and
minor
league
numbers
will
predict
their
future
numbers
fairly
well
their
are
some
caveats
the
younger
they
are
the
less
good
the
prediction
the
lower
the
minor
league
the
less
good
i
imagine
the
more
recent
the
player
has
left
college
ball
etc
now
of
course
this
prediction
involves
quite
a
bit
of
error
sometimes
a
player
with
poor
mles
dave
justice
the
ventura
becomes
a
star
some
hitters
develop
shane
mack
brian
downing
some
dont
oddibe
mcdowell
mickey
brantley
this
error
involves
real
things
there
are
real
reasons
why
oddibe
didnt
hit
and
shane
did
it
may
who
knows
involve
parks
and
batting
coaches
and
wheaties
and
injuries
and
lifting
and
so
on
but
still
you
have
this
big
pool
of
players
and
things
work
pretty
well
one
of
the
reasons
for
these
predictions
accuracy
is
the
common
background
of
the
players
one
thing
we
know
about
professional
baseball
players
is
that
all
of
them
or
almost
all
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
playing
ball
their
backgrounds
are
similar
what
hasnt
been
established
is
what
happens
when
you
encounter
a
player
with
a
different
background
is
there
some
reason
to
believe
that
a
bo
or
a
deion
or
a
lofton
or
a
tony
gwynn
or
an
ainge
or
so
on
has
such
a
different
background
that
the
standard
model
and
standard
assumptions
fit
this
person
slowly
it
hasnt
been
established
that
you
can
use
mles
with
twosport
players
it
hasnt
been
established
that
you
cant
but
then
statistics
is
after
all
an
art
i
personally
think
otherwise
lucid
individuals
continually
make
completely
nonsensical
statements
about
bo
and
deion
and
lofton
look
at
those
goodbutnotgreat
minor
league
numbers
they
say
well
what
happens
if
those
numbers
simply
dont
mean
what
they
usually
mean
it
might
mean
that
ken
lofton
suddenly
has
a
better
year
in
houston
than
tuscon
it
might
mean
that
deion
suddenly
has
a
better
halfyear
in
atlanta
than
greenville
then
again
it
might
not
ken
and
deion
might
go
right
back
in
the
tank
this
year
live
up
to
those
poor
mles
but
you
guys
dont
know
whats
worse
you
dont
know
that
you
dont
and
you
dont
know
that
there
are
other
players
you
wont
know
about
injuries
and
lifting
and
wheaties
again
you
seem
to
think
that
the
model
is
perfect
and
eternal
its
not
its
got
some

in

did
toronto
have

toronto
last

what

many

i

we

very
few
players
at
this

make
much
of
an
impact
in
the
bigs
especially
when
they
havent
even
played
aaa
ball
yes
but
this
is
irrelevant
youre
talking
about
averages
when
we
have
lots
of
information
about
this
player
in
particular
to
base
our
decisions
on
i
might
as
well
say
we
know
that
very
very
few
people
are
more
than
feet
tall
so
chances
are
that
manute
bol
is
really
only
foot
no
maybe
i
need
to
improve
my
writing

lopez
who
is
very
ordinary
defensively
is
not
likely
to
hit
so
well
at
age
having
not
played
at
aaa
level
that
it
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
rush
him
into
the
braves
lineup
in
why
isnt
lopez
likely
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjusting
his
stats
for
park
and
league
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolute
scale
than
olson
or
berryhill
did
by
a
lot
as
for
rushing
if
there
really
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
the
minors
and
the
majors
that
requires
a
period
of
adjustment
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
waste
lopezs
old
good
season
than
his
old
very
good
season
or
his
excellent
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclimated
the
more
of
his
prime
you
get
to
use
lopez
was
hitting
over
ab
when
he
was
cut
from
spring
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
gee
i
dont
know
abs
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
about
as
good
as
your
reasoning
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
every
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
as
a
gm
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
ok
most
players
are
not
ready
for
the
bigs
at
age
most
players
are
never
ready
for
the
bigs
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
javy
lopez
most
players
benefit
rather
than
being
stagnant
or
hurt
by
playing
at
aaa
see
above
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
but
i
could
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
frank
thomas
or
barry
bonds
most
players
arent
that
good
so
they
probably
wont
be
that
good
this
year
either
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
and
demonstrated
inabilities
to
hit
their
way
out
of
a
soap
bubble
not
superstars
mind
you
but
solid
experienced
veterans
not
superstars
not
stars
not
even
good
players
maybe
average
if
were
being
charitable
the
braves
have
a
very
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bats
in
the
outfield
an
excellent
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candidate
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hitting
shortstops
ummm
justice
is
a
very
fine
hitter
pendleton
might
have
another
big
year
in
his
bat
but
he
might
also
spend
the
season
in
hamstring
hell
gant
is
a
big
question
mark
the
breamhunter
platoon
is
decent
not
excellent
and
has
rotten
obp
or
slg
depending
on
whos
in
blauser
is
a
very
valuable
bat
for
a
shortstop
the
center
field
platoon
will
probably
hit
however
good
lopez
bat
might
be
given
the
above
it
wont
be
so
much
better
than
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differential
in
experience
and
defensive
ability
wanna
bet
the
difference
between
lopezs
bat
and
olsonberryhill
could
be
or
runs
over
the
course
of
the
season
given
a
choice
between
a
player
with
experience
and
a
player
who
can
play
ill
take
the
latter
every
time
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchell
did
i
am
just
so
surprised
i
have
to
spell
all
of
this
out
my
goodness
do
you
believe
the
other
poster
who
thinks
lopez
is
being
held
down
because
of
his
future
earning
potential
that
was
me
and
you
so
far
your
only
counterproposal
is
that
they
really
dont

how
good
lopez
is

overvalue
experience

some

the
two

well
perhaps
if
the
braves
had
no
one
else
worth
playing
this
year
it
would
be
lopez
in
there
but
they
do
have
others
worth
playing
at
least
in
their
opinion
catcher
is
their
weakest
position
with
the
possible
exception
of
second
base
they
have
a
chance
to
simultaneously
replace
their
biggest
offensive
problem
spot
with
a
wellaboveaverage
offensive
player
and
acclimate
a
highly
promising
potential
star
with
no
pressure
on
him
to
carry
the
team
and
they
want
to
play
olson
and
berryhill
instead
i
disagree
in
that
i
dont
think
it
is
a
tangible
skill
any
more
than
leadership
is
i
dont
deny
that
it
is
a
real
skill
and
that
some
catchers
may
be
much
better
than
others
at
it
but
i
really
dont
see
any
way
that
we
could
ever
know
who
they
are
nicholss
law
of
catcher
defense
is
eerily
accurate
far
too
often
for
me
to
take
defensive
assessments
of
catchers
very
seriously
sorry
new
dont
know
nichols
law
a
catchers
defensive
reputation
will
be
inversely
proportional
to
his
recent
offensive
level
of
performance
thus
mickey
tettleton
goes
in
the
media
from
being
a
nohit
defensive
whiz
to
a
slugging
thumbfinger
in
two
short
years
the
rule
doesnt
apply
to
perceived
superstars
who
get
the
gold
glove
offensive
transfer
effect
instead
greg
olson
is
probably
considered
to
be
a
good
defensive
catcher
precisely
because
he
cant
hit
dont
believe
in
catchers
era
but
i
am
interested
in
pitchers
eras
with
different
catchers
arent
they
the
same
thing
in
other
words
we
know
more
than
they
do
so
the
only
logic
behind
a
different
decision
than
we
would
make
must
be
financial
either
that
or
just
stupidity
i
presume
we
feel
this
way
about
other
franchises
than
atlanta
no
of
course
is
it
fair
to
the
young
players
no
does
it
make
organizational
sense
i
think
it
does
well
if
it
does
make
organizational
sense
one
can
hardly
fault
them
for
their
decisions
i
mean
please
dont
tell
me
how
to
run
my
business
especially
when
im
being
successful
one
could
make
the
same
sort
of
argument
in
other
cases
pete
rose
in
pursuing
ty
cobbs
record
was
a
huge
gate
attraction
and
national
media
magnet
the
reds
made
a
lot
of
money
off
that
they
also
wasted
the
prime
of
eric
davis
that
may
be
good
business
but
that
doesnt

i

doesnt

out

i
know
if
he
didnt

he
wouldnt
be

he

and
michael

jack

wouldnt

if
they
werent
entertainers
so
whats
your
point
i
just
dont
understand
how
some
athlete
who
only
plays
a
sport
for
a
living
for
millions
of
dollars
say
he
is
not
being
paid
enough
if
nobody
will
sign
him
for
his
asking
price
he
will
be
the
one
hurting
the
as
will
still
win
without
him
will
they
you
cant
usually
take
away
one
of
the
teams
best
players
and
still
expect
them
to
win
or
do
you
think
the
pirates
will
continue
to
win
without
barry
bonds
remeber
many
of
these
athletes
have
nothing
if
not
for
their
athletic
ability
nothing
they
are
getting
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
they
are
complaining
of
not
enough
pay
so
again
jack
nicholson
gets
paid
much
more
than
most
hard
working
citizens
and
much
more
than
rickey
henderson
for
that
matter
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
them
making
millions
my
problem
is
when
the
say
they
arent
being
paid
enough
when
they
already
get
millionalso
their
numbers
get
worse
the
reason
the
latter
often
happens
is
that
many
of
these
folks
start
making
the
real
big
salaries
late
in
their
career
when
they
are
on
the
decline
there
are
exceptions
of
course
dave
parker
fell

maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
for
a
stathead
im
amazed
that
you
put
any
credence
in
spring
training
did
you
notice
who
he
got
those
hits
off
of
or
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
it
doesnt
make
a
difference
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
just
like
keith
mitchell
did
wait
a
minute
i
missed
something
here
first
forget
keith
mitchell
are
you
saying
that
a
kid
who
moves
from
aa
to
aaa
and
then
does
not
improve
would
have
been
better
off
making
a
direct
leap
to
the
majors
if
a
player
does
well
at
aa
and
then
does
not
improve
at
aaa
isnt
that
a
sign
that
maybe
he
doesnt
belong
in
the
bigs
now
keith
mitchell
as
i
recall
no
stat
books
handy
surprise
he
jumped
from
aa
to
atlanta
in
he
did
so
well
that
he
was
returned
to
the
minors
where
he
didnt
do
very
well
at
all
now
his
career
is
in
jeopardy
so
how
does
he
fit
in
with
your
point
good
mles
in
aa
moved
him
right
to
the
big
club
now
hes
one
step
away
from
being
traded
or
moved
out
of
baseball
duh
that
was
me
and
you
so
far
your
only
counterproposal
is
that
they
really
dont
understand
how
good
lopez
is
or
overvalue
experience
or
some
combination
of
the
two
i
think
my
interpretation
was
more
flattering
to
the
organization
well
ive
cast
my
lot
certainly
you
may
understand
better
how
good
lopez
is
and
i
may
overvalue
experience

neither
one

the

also

im

all

um
surely
you
didnt
intend
to
compare
the
reds
with
the
philidelphia
as
the
yankees
were
finishing
to
a
team
that
was
as
good
as
the
yankees
while
the
yankees
had
aged
some
from
their
peak
years
ruth
and
gehrig
couldnt
play
every
position
simultaneously
imo
given
the
various
ages
of
the
braves
and
reds
this
season
that
the
braves
will
be
closer
to
their
peak
while
the
reds
have
slightly
passed
their
peak
also
if
youre
going

a

might

subject
re
young
catchers
since
i
was
the
one
responsible
for
these
divergent
threads
of
approx
posts
going
back
to
the
braves
could
be
better
off
if
an
injury
happens
i
may
as
well
inject
a
little
more
fuel
to
the
flame
back
at
the
beginning
of
spring
training
i
though
lopez
would
make
the
squad
easily
olson
was
still
recovering
from
his
lateseason
injury
knee
i
believe
and
there
were
questions
as
to
whether
he
would
be
able
to
play
before
june
and
then
berryhill
was
dinged
up
i
was
looking
forward
to
this
because
i
believe
that
lopez
can
hit
and
field
the
position
before
last
season
he
was
the
braves
defensive
catcher
prospect
while
brian
deak
was
the
braves
offensive
catcher
prospect
besides
olson
and
berryhill
couldnt
hit
their
way
out
of
a
wet
cardboard
box
and
dont
walk
enough
to
be
useful
but
olson
recovered
quickly
berryhill
recovered
and
the
braves
went
with
the
two
vets
i
still
say
that
if
one
of
those
two
had
been
down
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
wouldnt
have
gotten
his
job
back
there
is
a
certain
logic
to
keeping
olson
and
berryhill
around
after
all
ml
catchers
are
in
short
supply
and
suffer
from
wear
and
tear
there
are
teams
out
there
without
one
average
ml
catcher
california
and
seattle
come
to
mind
certainly
trying
to
move
olson
or
berryhill
through
waivers
would
be
unlikely
to
work
plus
youd
have
to
eat
that
salary
which
isnt
huge
but
isnt
tiddleywinks
either
i
think
olsons
at
about
berryhill
at
but
thats
only
what
i
recall
yes
i
think
arbitrationeligibility
may
have
a
role
to
play
in
this
also
what
is
it
that
of
the
players
arent
eligible
for
arbitration
only
the
that
were
on
the
roster
the
longest
are
eligible
of
course
the
system
may
change
but
the
extent
of
that
change
is
not
yet
known
from
a
business
standpoint
it
may
make
sense
to
keep
lopez
down
until
junethe
first
time
olsonberryhill
go
on
the
dl
i
am
still
disappointed
that
lopez
isnt
on
the
team
i
still
prefer
to
think
of
myself
as
a
fan
when
it
comes
to
the
braves
and
the
truth
is
that
id
rather
see
our
best
team
on
the
field
which
imo
includes
lopez
of
coursetoday
we
play
the
cubs
hopefully
we
wont
need
him
as
for
the
schuerholzcox
conversation
i
imagine
it
went
like
this
remember
theyve
both
been
gms
the
following
is
not
meant
to
be
read
by
the
humorimpaired
cox
ok
weve
sent
jones
down
his
fielding
could
be
a
little
smoother
besides
blauser
can
hit
ok
and
his
fielding
is
better
than
it
used
to
be
schuerholz
well
well
have
to
send
nieves
down
too
deion
just
wont
sign
that
baseball
only
contract
we
cant
count
on
him
in
october
so
we
have
to
keep
nixon
around
for
the
defense
besides
gormans
not
ready
to
give
up
on
billy
hatcher
yet
once
hatchers
gone
and
deion
signs
we
can
move
nixon
for
frankie
rodriguez
that
ought
to
give
us
some
pitching
depth
in
cox
yep
thatll
be
nice
too
bad
deion
wont
sign
ok
ill
look
for
nieves
when
justice
starts
having
berryberryer
back
problems
again
now
what
about
klesko
schuerholz
well
weve
still
got
to
fork
out
another
mil
for
bream
if
we
keep
klesko
we
either
lose
the
money
or
cabrera
i
keep
dangling
sid
in
front
of
dal
maxwell
but
somehow
he
doesnt
seem
to
be
the
same
gm
first
jeffries
for
jose
and
now
whiten
for
clark
if
he
gets
rid
of
brian
jordan
then
id
have
to
believe
that
he
and
whitey
herzog
switched
bodies
at
the
winter
meetings
cox
ok
keep
trying
on
bream
and
ill
wait
til
the
trading
deadline
for
my
hunterklesko
platoon
maybe
i
can
get
a
few
extra
atbats
for
cabrera
while
we
wait
try
california
if
snow
starts
slowly
maybe
whiteydal
will
bite
on
sid
and
if
that
doesnt
work
then
perhaps
sids
knees
could
be
persuaded
to
act
up
theres
always
the
dl
mwahahahaha
schuerholz
what
about
caraballo
cox
well
hes
not
that
much
better
than
lemke
maybe
if
he
starts
in
richmond
hell
start
walking
more
besides
if
hes
going
to
be
arbitrationeligible
better
to
stretch
him
out
so
that
we
actually
get
some
value
from
him
before
he
makes
the
big
bucks
schuerholz
now
lets
see
that
leaves
lopez
cox
nooooo
i
gotta
keep
lopez
sure
i
didnt
think
olson
would
recover
this
quickly
maybe
i
can
talk
caminiti
into
running
into
him
again
schuerholz
nope
lopez
has
gotta
go
you
know
that
hell
get
million
in
arbitration
may
as
well
put
it
off
that
one
extra
year
besides
until
olsons
shown
his
stuff
a
little
bit
i
cant
trade
him
besides
berryhills
a
lefthanded
hitter
you
know
how
rare
that
is
cox
dont
you
mean
a
lefthanded
whiffer
pretty
common
if
you
ask
me
i
mean
he
made
pat
borders
look
good
in
the
world
series
pat
borders
schuerholz
hey
youre
the
one
who
wouldnt
write
lopez
into
the
lineup
cox
well
youre
the
one
who
went
out
and
got
me
jeff
reardon
besides
i
thought
lopez
wouldnt
be
used
to
our
pitching
staffs
stuff
he
got
some
time
with
them
this
springlooked
pretty
good
come
on
surely
we
only
need
to
keep
one
stiff
behind
the
plate
schuerholz
yeah
but
which
stiff
whichever
one
we
keep
will
be
hurt
by
may
cox
ok
ok
you
made
your
point
keep
them
both
surely
one
of
them
will
be
on
the
dl
by
june
at
the
latest
then
i
can
call

i
watched
him

the

actually

i
give
maldonado
the
edge
however
like

a

unfortunately
it
shows
that
lopez
wasnt
as
good
an
example
as
nieves
would
have
been
since
his
last
year
numbers
were
out
of
line
with
the
previous
years
which
i
didnt
have
access
to
the
point
remains
though
knowing
a
guys
minor
league
history
is
as
good
as
knowing
his
major
league
history
if
you
know
how
to
read
it
why
isnt
lopez
likely
to
hit
that
well
he
hit
that
well
last
year
after
adjusting
his
stats
for
park
and
league
and
such
he
hit
better
on
an
absolute
scale
than
olson
or
berryhill
did
by
a
lot
i
dont
know
you
tell
me
what
percentage
of
players
reach
or
exceed
their
mles
in
their
rookie
season
were
talking
about
you
know
the
mle
is
not
a
projection
its
an
equivalence
its
a
this
is
how
well
he
hit
last
year
in
major
league
terms
rating
so
in
essence
he
has
already
reached
it
i
would
guess
bob
clay
that
essentially
half
of
all
players
surpass
their
previous
mles
in
their
rookie
seasons
maybe
more
than
half
since
all
of
these
players
are
young
and
improving
if
that
were
your
purpose
maybe
offerman
spent
getting
acclimated
if
you
will
the
dodgers
as
a
team
paid
a
big
price
that
season
did
they
offerman
may
have
been
the
difference
between
or
place
and
last
place
but
no
more
perhaps
they
will
reap
the
benefits
down
the
road
do
you
really
think
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
if
they
were
competing
for
a
pennant
sure
they
didnt
have
anyone
better
i
suppose
they
might
have
gutted
the
farm
system
to
acquire
jay
bell
or
spike
owen
or
somebody
if
they
were
really
in
contention
the
point
was
not
that
ab
is
a
significant
sample
but
rather
that
he
hadnt
done
anything
in
spring
training
to
cause
even
a
blockhead
manager
to
question
whether
his
minor
league
numbers
were
for
real
or
to
send
him
down
until
he
gets
warmed
up
for
a
stathead
im
amazed
that
you
put
any
credence
in
spring
training
if
youd
read
what
i
wrote
youd
be
less
amazed
nowhere
do
i
claim
to
put
any
credence
in
spring
training
quite
the
contrary
i
said
that
lopez
hadnt
done
anything
that
even
the
bozos
who
do
put
credence
in
spring
training
could
interpret
as
failure
just
because
i
think
spring
training
numbers
are
meaningless
doesnt
mean
that
bobby
cox
does
its
just
a
case
of
ruling
out
one
possible
explanation
for
sending
lopez
down
the
kid

improve

re

most
of

has
been
between
mark
singer
and
david
tate
with
valentine
weighing
in
on
the
same
side
as
dave
at
various
times
my
opinion
fwiw
to
all
mark
age
doesnt
matter
ability
does
i
would
rather
have
the
untried
rookie
with
great
minor
league
numbers
than
the
veteran
who
has
proven
himself
to
be
average
at
best
i
dont
care
if
he
is
if
he
plays
better
than
what
i
have
i
want
him
out
there
sandy
alomar
had
decent
minor
league
numbers
grossly
inflated
by
the
pcl
in
general
and
las
vegas
in
particular
he
should
have
been
projected
as
an
average
major
league
hitter
which
is
good
for
a
catcher
ill
admit
santiagos
numbers
would
probably
come
out
the
same
as
sandys
but
i
dont
have
the
league
data
from
the
to
check
it
out
that
being
said
i
agree
with
sending
lopez
to
richmond
at
least
to
start
the
season
as
the
box
below
shows
he
has
one
minor
league
season
in
which
he
hit
well
he
has
two
in
which
he
hit
very
very
poorly
i
want
to
see
that
the
lopez
is
real
olson
and
berryhill
are
not
complete
mediocrities
for
catchers
especially
nl
catchers
they
are
essentially
average
hitters
with
equivalent
averages
around
if
he
had
hit
well
at
prior
levels
i
would
say
he
belongs
on
the
braves
but
there
is
a
reasonable
chance
that
lopez
last
year
was
just
as
much
a
fluke
as
alomar
in
or
santiago
in
one
year
at
any
level
at
any
age
doesnt
satisfy
my
standards

evidence

his

last

he

is
more
valuable
than
the
ops
alone
indicates
and
at

had

he
has

above

which
was
about
in

he
has
shown
at

the
potential
of
going
into

which
would
make
him
one
of
the
best
hitters
in
the
league
he
has
two
full
seasons
before
reaching

i

the

was
made
by

henderson
and
on
nolan
pitched
his

on
the

a

someone
stole
his

which
overshadowed
it
it
seems
that
nolan
is
having
a

imo
rickey
deserves
it
and
it
seems
as
most
of
the

agrees
with
me
from
what
ive
seen
on
it
lately
they
are
both
great
players
but
imo
nolan
has
outclassed

more

in

wouldnt

his

more

you
get
to
use
can
anybody
name
a
player
who
was

majors
lets
for
arguments
sake
define
rushed
as
brought
up
to
the
majors
for
more
than
a
cup
of
coffee
prior
at
age
or
younger
and
performing
below
expectations
whose
career
was
damaged
by
this
rushing
im
serious
i
tend
to
agree
with
david
that
bringing
the
player
up
sooner
is
better
but
id
like
to
look
at
players
for
whom
this
theory
didnt
work
if
there
are
any
id
prefer
players
within
the
last
years
or
so
because
then
i
can
look
up
their
minor
league
stats
its
important
to
distinguish
between
players
who
legitimately
had
careers
below
what
their
minor
league
numbers
would
have
projected
as
opposed
to
players
who
were
hyped
and
failed
but
actually
had
careers
not
out
of
line
with
their
minor
league
numbers
lets
kick
it
off
with
an
example
of
a
player
who
was
rushed
although
there
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
any
damage
to
his
career
jay
bell
was
given
pas
in
the
major
leagues
at
age
and
performed
well
below
what
you
would
expect
from
his
aaa
numbers
the
same
season
he
got
pas
the
next
year
at
age
and
still
underperformed
however
the
next
year
at
age
his
performance
improved
and
he
won
the
everyday
shortstop
job
and
has
been
there
ever
since
its
really
hard
for
me
to
see
where
he
would
have
been
better
off
staying
in
the
minor
league
where
he
was
performed
quite
well
in
aaa
during
this
time
rather
than
being
rushed
cleveland
might
have
been
better
off
i
suppose
because
they
might
have
been
less
likely
to
give
up
on
him
yes
if
you
bring
a
player
up
early
hes
likely
going
to
struggle
but
does
that
delay
the
time
at
which
he
stops
struggling
and
starts
performing
up
to
expectations

catchers
mssnetcomcom
mark
singer
said
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
this
is
the
crux
of
the
argument
to
me
at
least
both
the
sdcn
and
the
nonsdcn
camps
seem
to
agree
on
the
fact
that
a
catchers
defense
is
basically
nonmeasurable
at
present
you
can
talk
about
how
important
calling
a
game
is
or
framing
the
pitches
or
blocking
balls
in
the
dirt
but
there
is
little
or
no
way
to
tell
exactly
how
various
catchers
rank
in
defense
looking
at
lopez
specifically
is
there
any
reason
to
suspect
that
he
is
a
bad
defensive
catcher
other
then
the
fact
that
the
braves
or
the
media
has
labeled
him
a
bad
defensive
catcher
as
far
as
i
can
tell
he
doesnt
have
any
particular
problem
in
his
mechanics
such
as
sasser
he
might
be
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
in
blocking
the
ball
or
framing
the
pitch
to
get
a
good
call
but
all
he
needs
to
clear
that
up
is
playing
and
practice
time
i
cant
see
how
repetitions
at
aaa
are
any
better
then
reps
in
the
majors
all
were
left
with
is
the
calling
the
game
aspect
olsen
and
berryhill
at
always
given
credit
for
calling
good
games
and
helping
the
pitchering
staff
but
this
is
a
reputation
that
is
given
to
almost
all
veteran
catchers
how
is
catching
at
aaa
going
to
help
lopez
learn
the
major
league
pitching
staff
the
only
way
any
catcher
is
going
to
learn
tom
glavines
pitches
is
to
catch
tom
glavine
similarly
i
wouldnt
be
supprised
if
the
pitchers
claimed
to
prefer
pitching
to
olsen
over
pitching
to
lopez
because
they
are
used
to
pitching
to
olsen
but
given
time
they
will
say
they
are
comfortable
with
lopez
now
since
lopez
cant
learn
how
to
handle
the
major
league
pitchers
while
hes
in
aaa
and
since
he
doesnt
have
any
glaring
problem
in
his
mechanics
what
is
he
going
to
learn
in
aaa
that
he
cant
learn
just
as
well
while
in
the
majors

i

you
are

off

here
another

offense
makes
them
my
pick
for
last
too
well
theres
also
my
policy
of
never
picking
a
buck
rodgers
team
for
last
florida
chicago
i
dont
know
if
an
expansion
team
has
ever
finished
not
last
but
i
think
this
year
might
be
a
first
if
it
hasnt
ever
happened
the
cubs
are
worse
the
angels
were
game
out
of
the
athletics
and
expansion
senators
finished
tied
for
last
the
colt
finshed
ahead
of
the
cubs
the
mets
were
last
the
royals
finshed
ahead
of
the
white
sox
the
pilots
in
last
the
mariners
finished
ahead
of
the
athleticsin
last
apparently
being
an
expansion
team
with
a
poor
as
or
chicago
team
around
is
a
good
thing

argh
here
is
where
you
are
obviously
dead
wrong
not
since
the
yankees
of
the
and
has
a
team
been
so
nicely
setup
as
this
yearsand
years
to
come
braves
i
dont
think
that
the
allstar
team
will
be
able
to
beat
this
may
be
an
appropriate
comparison
the
yankees
finshed
and
finshing
and
games
out
of
first
in
and
they
also
finished
second
though
they
were
only
and
games
out
even
great
teams
can
lose
thats
why
they
play
the
season
on
the
other
hand
im
still
picking
the
braves
to
go
all

steve

he

i
cant
understand
why
hes
not
actually
back
in
the

itself
the
other
day
he
called
sosas
homerun
against
the
sox
and
claimed
the
game
would
be
going
into
extra
innings
when
the
score
was
in
the
so
yesterday
he
notices
that
sosas
ahead
in
the
count
against
maddux
and
says
this
is
a
fastball
situation
and
sosa
will
be
looking
for
it
but
this
is
also
the
spot
where
maddux
throws
the
straight
change
sure
enough
sosa
gets
ahead
on
it

pops

he

i

left

started

where
even
the

he
underperformed

he

whats

actually
i

what

it

something

this

honor

say
all
you

i
hated

at

for

nine
months
from
ian
m
derby
i
was
watching
the
dodgersmarlins
game
yesterday
and
a
couple
of
things
impressed
me
first
is
that
the
way
the
sun
was
shining
in
miami
it
had
a
summer
atmosphere
in
early
spring
for
baseball
in
comparison
wrigley
field
in
early
april
still
has
a
wintry
look
to
it
with
the
dead
ivy
and
bundled
up
fans
the
second
and
most
important
was
the
fans
i
like
these
guysgals
i
will
admit
i
am
a
football
fan
first
but
i
still
enjoy
baseball
it
was
interesting
because
most
of
these
fans
are
only
accustomed
to
the
miami
dolphins
the
way
they
were
cheering
i
thought
it
was
the
afc
playoffs
of
course
opening
day
may
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it
but
i
really
got
feeling
of
electricity
that
i
think
is
lacking
with
a
lot
of
baseball
fans
in
other
cities
baseball
certainly
needs
a
charge
and
i
hope
these
two
expansion
teams
bring
back
some
excitement
well
find
out
friday
how
denver
bronco

phillies
are
i
better
say
it
now
before
my
opportunity
passes
by
from
ian
m
derby
i
personally
will
never
forget
mike
schmidts
home
run
against
the
expos
in
that
decided
the
nl
east
it
was
also
his
career
high
another
home
run
that
i
thought
was
totally
incredible
was
in
the
alcs
the
ca
angles
had
the
boston
red
sox
strike
away
from
the
pennant
until
don
baylor
hit
a
two
strike
pitch
for
a
home
run
that
was
the
most
incredible
turn
of
events
i
have
ever
seen
in
baseball
the
sox
later
took
the
pennant
away
only
to
have
the
same
thing
done
to
them
in
the
ws
against
the
mets
speaking
of
the
mets
isnt
it
strange
how
the
nlcs
that
year
with
the
astros
almost
mirrored
the
nlcs
with
the
phillies
the
astros
have
been
painfully
close
twice
i
must
admit
from
ian
m
derby
this
talk
about
the
phillies
winning
the
nl
east
is
scary
very
scary
dont
get
me
wrong
im
a
phillies
fan
but
as
late
as
last
year
they
looked
helpless
the
funny
thing
was
they
did
have
a
lot
of
injuries
in
spring
training
that
basically
killed
their
chances
of
course
dont
forget
the
dykstra
wrist
injury
in
the
first
or
second
game
from
ian
m
derby
after
reading
my
local
paper
today
i
found
out
that
the
phillies
started
the
season
at
i
am
not
as
old
as
but
ive
heard
many
talk
about
the
serious
choke
job
the
phillies
did
that
season
they
were
ahead
of
the
cardinals
by
games
that
season
in
midaugust
they
managed
to
lose
a
bunch
from
then
on
and
the
cardinals
took
the

games
ahead
and
lost
it

is

thanks
for

i
find

fascinating
of

a
run
scored
is
just
as
important
as
a
run
prevented
just
as
a
penny
saved
is
a
penny
earned
enough
with
the
cliches
my
point
is
that
if
the
braves
starters
are
able
to
live
up
to
their
potential
they
wont
need
much
offensive
support
i
realize
this
is
a
big
if
this
staff
leaves
the
bosox
in
the
dust
there
is
no
legitimate
comparison
two
cy
young
winners
and
three
other
pitchers
that
most
any
team
in
the
league
would
kill
to
have
as
their
first
or
second
starter
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
they
should
have
many
low
scoring
games
due
to
their
excellent
pitching
and
below
average
hitting
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
starting
lineup
of
great
offensive
players
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
team
would
not
need
great
pitchers
they
would
have
an
advantage
because
they
could
simply
outscore
their
opponent
the
name
of
the
games
is
to
win
even
ray
knight
knows
that
you
do
this
by
putting
more
runs
up
on
the
scoreboard
all
im
trying
to
say
is
that
if
you
assemble
the
quality
pitchers
like
the
braves
have
the
offense
doesnt
need
to
be

strong

what

about
his

is
the
way
he
leans
out
over
the

pitches

this
not
done
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
pitch
but
to
make
it
seemthis
ball
is
so
far
out
i
need
to
lean
just
to
get
near
it
so
you
better
call
it
a

this

my
unbiased
opinion
of

i

your
mileage
will
vary

joe

has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
i
cant
take
this
anymore

and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surprises
the
book
on
tartabull
was
keep
him
healthy
and
hell
produce
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
hes
hit
a
few
homers
but
those
were
all
solo
shots
and
he
hasnt
gotten
any
of
the
big
rbis
that
your
cleanup
man
is
supposed
to
give
you
then
again
he
had
a
slow
start
last
year
once
he
got
off
the
dl
that
is
and
turned
into
a
oneman
wrecking
crew
see
you
in
the
series
alan
lets
see
april
less
than
at
bats
and
you
claim
that
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
cut
this
guy
some
slack
danny
will
produce
this
year
its
scary
to
think
just
how
much
hell
produce
if
he
were
to
stay
healthy
all
year
the
yanks
have
a
lot
going
for
them
this
year
good
starting
rotation
good
bullpen
good
defense
and
a
good
lineup
also
i
like
buck
showalter
frank
howard
on
is
also
a
good
move
everything
sounds
good
so
far
if
the
yanks
stay
healthy
they
have
a
good
chance
at
winning
the
pennant
this
is
the
most
fun
ive
had
watching
the
yanks
since

you
all
know
how
things
turned
out
the
orioles
red
sox
and
yankees
all
disappeared
the
jays
and
tigers
continued
at
essentially
the
expected
pace
the
brewers
and
indians
cranked
in
the
second
half
the
rangers
predictably
took
a
dive
that
shouldnt
have
surprised
anybody
meanwhile
as
predicted
the
mariners
dropped
behind
the
angels
and
royals
they
clearly
didnt
deserve
the
record
in
june
the
white
sox
and
as
upped
their
game
a
bit
while
the
twins
dropped
off
a
little
but
for
the
most
part
things
were
as
expected
okay
so
there
were
a
few
blatant
errors
but
for
a
predictive
calculation
i
thought
this
did
pretty
well
from
cavgeoeyalevmyccyaleedu
tue

the

insert
kent
mercker
into
the
starting
rotation
sometime
this

bielecki
is
traded
or
released
lei
brandt
becomes
the
fifth
starter
and
the
best
bullpen
in
baseball
has
pena
berenguer
stanton
wohlers
freeman
and
pete
smith
who
spotstarts
as
well
hm
pete
smith
made
the
rotation
instead
of
mercker
and
bielecki
wasnt
released
until
the
end
of

year
i
wont
comment

find

come

do
you

down

you
predict
mark
grace
will
get
rbis
i
say
you
are
out
of
your
mind
that
is
almost
impossible
for
a
type
guy
batting
behind
dawson
who
kills
most
of
the
rallies
he
doesnt
finish
why
do
you
say
that
mark
has
driven
in
and
last
year
mark
was
batting
second
primarily
and
it
was
his
worse
year
average
wise
since
he
is
batting
either
or
this
year
i
predict
he
will
be
back
up
to
his
previous
standards
i
think
he
will
be
better
rbis
is
not
that
much
of
a
stretch
sometimes
us
statheads
get
lucky
grace
didnt
hit
behind
dawson
the
entire
season
but
he
also
finished
with
only
rbis
from
tue
may
the
most
ballsy
prediction
ever
mark
mcgwire
will
hit
or
more
hrs
this
year
nope
he
slowed
down
and
the
injury
finished
him
off
didnt
even
reach
but
a
ballsy
prediction
nonetheless
from
ecaxronmarslercnasagov
thu
may
baltimore
will
not
fade
they
will
not
win
the
division
this
year
but
they
will
finish
within
five
games
i
find
the
prospect
of
two
orioles
winning
each
easier
to
comprehend
than
that
of
two
sox
no
offense
i
think
their
pitching
is
about
as
good
as
the
division
has
to
offer
the
orioles
finished
seven
games
out
none
of
them
won
though
mussina
might
have
had
a
chance
with
better
relief
and
more
starts
nobody
else
in
the
division
is
worth
a
darn
they
all
finish
a
minimum
of
fifteen
games
out
the
tribe
thats
another
reason
to
watch
baltimore
this
year
and
next
they
wont
waste
many
of
those
games
against
the
rest
of
the
division
except
for
the
brewers
who
you
probably
forgot
you
were
right
the
rest
of
the
division
was
thoroughly
mediocre
the
yankees
and
indians
led
with
wins
the
red
sox
trailed
with
wins
none
were
horrible
but
four
were
five
or
more
games
below

david

date
thu
aug

right
that
was
me
i
never
said
the
jays
were
a
cinch
to
clinch
it
but
i
said
that
milwaukee
will
be
more
of
a
threat
than
baltimore
i
do
think
that
toronto
should
win
it
but
after
i
dont
consider
anything
a
cinch
unless
you
have
something
like
a
game
lead
with
games
to
go
i
do
think
that
the
jays
have
the
best
talented
team
in
the
al
east
and
if
we
had
a
good
or
even
average
manager
we
might
have
a
bigger
lead
right
now
i
also
think
that
the
orioles
will
not
play
much
better
than
baseball
for
the
rest
of

orioles
will
win
games
in
at
least
of
the
next
years
probably
the
last

their
pitching
staff
will
have
a
team
era
among
the
best
in

al
in
at

of
the
next
years
but
not
necessarily
all
the
same
years
as
they
win
this
one
will
take
a
long
time
to
verify
i
dont
think
i
want
to
wait
that
long
but
they
won
games
last
year
and
they
were
fifth
in
the
league
in
era
not
a
bad
start
ben
mcdonald
will
not
challenge
for
an
era
title
in
the
next
years
nor
will
he
have
victories
either
year
by
challenge
i
mean
finish
among
the
leaders
being
among
the
leaders
before
the
season
is
done
doesnt
count
he
will
probably
never
be
the
pitcher
he
was
hyped
to
be
but
is
still
a
decent
starter
to
have
looks
like
it
he
wasnt
bad
last
year
just
too
consistent
to
be
an
ace
so
far
this
year
looks
like
more
of
the
same
the
phillies
will
give
up
many
fewer
walks
ifwhen
they
get
rid
of
their
bullpen
coach
ryan
i
am
not
predicting
when
or
whether
they
will
get
rid
of
him
and
you
will
have
to
give
the
team
a
little
bit
of
time
to
adjust
before
seeing
the
radical
change
they
would
have
a
fine
pitching
staff
if
they
would
just
steal
ray
miller
away
from
pittsburg
the
white
sox
seem
to
have
the
same
problem
but
not
as
bad
i
honestly
cant
say
did
they
get
rid
of
him
their
bb
totals
were
down
last
year
ricky
jordan
will
have
rbi
if
he
starts
games
hitting
in
the

or
spot
in
any
lineup
or
the
spot
in

very

no

i

can

current
plans
seem
to
be
to
use

a

just
as
a

is
a

earned
enough
with
the
cliches
its
not
a
cliche
and
unlike
your
comments
below
its
not
a
tautology
it
neednt
have
been
true
if
every
pitcher
in
baseball
were
essentially
the
same
in
quality
ie
if
the
variance
of
pitching
ability
were
much
smaller
than
the
variance
of
batting
ability
then
scoring
runs
would
be
much
more
important
than
preventing
them
simply
because
the
ability
to
actively
prevent
runs
would
be
much
weaker
my
point
is
that
if
the
braves
starters
are
able
to
live
up
to
their
potential
they
wont
need
much
offensive
support
if
thats
your
point
you
should
have
said
so
what
you
in
fact
said
was
pitching
and
defense
win
championships
and
later
pitching
is
the
essence
of
baseball
neither
of
which
says
what
you
are
now
claiming
was
your
point
and
neither
of
which
is
true
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
and
you
accuse
sherri
of
mouthing
cliches
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
its
not
clear
to
me
at
all
that
this
is
true
in
highscoring
games
the
team
with
the
better
offense
wins
a
high
percentage
of
the
time
in
low
scoring
games
the
split
is
essentially
regardless
of
team
ability
they
should
have
many
low
scoring
games
due
to
their
excellent
pitching
and
below
average
hitting
on
the
flip
side
if
you
had
a
starting
lineup
of
great
offensive
players
i
would
be
arguing
that
this
team
would
not
need
great
pitchers
i
thought
you
said
pitching

defense
win
championships
and
pitching
is
the
essence

thought

they
let

the
rumors
concerning
next
years
uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
traditional
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniforms
may
totally
eliminate
the
color
orange
shiver
mclanes
favorite
color
is
red
so
im
really
upset
the
current
unforms
are
dull
and
the
new
ones
sound
horrible
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretty
but
houston
had
established
a
long
precident
of
wearing
the
ugliest
uniforms
in
baseball
and
i
liked
it
end
of
the
bargain
remember
two
years
ago
a
little
relief
goes
a
long
way
then
they
could
win
games
but
i
doubt
it
ill

heck
if

hohum
is
seriously
being

is
lee

ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a

or
darrell

yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of

takes
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddie

and
jeff

well
in
any

i
am
sick

tired
mostly
sick

honestly
ozzie

moe

my

we

on

at

well
theres
a

about

thats
just

i

the

is
moe
berg
athlete
scholar
spy
by
tom

two
other
people
whose

i

sewell
wrote
the

this
is
a

for

also
excellent
is
the

on

in

during

im

bergs

in

heisenbergs

his

also
wrote
a
book
about
moe
that
she
selfpublished
the
title
is
something
like
my

morris
berg
its
mainly
some
of

memories
and
page
after
page
of
xerox
copies
of

that

writes
joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
hes
not
the
greatest
this
is
true
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
i
saw
it
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
lankford
was
hurt
although
the
announcer
said
he
told
torre
he
could
pinch
hit
if
they
needed
him
to
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
i
wondered
the
same
thing
but
giving
joe
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
id
say
he
was
thinking
that
lankford
is
hurt
enough
that
he
didnt
trust
his
ability
to
bat
effectively
but
he
wants
his
speed
on
the
bases
so
pinch
run
him
alicea
i
was
completely
confused
about
maybe
he
had
a
good
record
hitting
against
that
particular
pitcher
i
dont
know
anybody
got
an
idea
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
well
so
far
i
havent
seen
much
to
say
whiten
shouldnt
be
playing
but
it
is
too
bad
that
gilkey
is
the
odd
man
out
when
they
play
jordan
ahead
of
him
that
i
dont
quite
understand
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
yup
i
looked
for
this
on
the
replay
too
if
im
joe
torre
im
going
to
have
a
talk
with
bucky
after
the
game
on
that
one
hes
got
lankford
at
third
with
todd
zeile
i
believe
a
hot
hitter
coming
up
theres
no
reason
to
risk
giving
lankford
the
go
sign
in
that
situation
unless
he
was
sure
the
ball
is
going
to
the
stands
its
his
job
to
watch
the
play
develop
he
should
have
known
larkin
was
there
to
back
up
a
bad
throw
that
seemed
inexcusable
in
my
book
btw
i
saw
dent
do
the
same
thing
last
year
with
zeile
rounding
third
and
going
into
a
sure
out
at
home
in
a
critical
situation
on
the
replay
theres
dent
waving
him
around
it
looks
like
this
might
be
a
serious
problem
the
cards
werent
good
base
runners
at
all
last
year
and
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
fault
lies
in
the
base
coaching
i
cant
take
this
anymore

pitching
he
decides
to
bench

a

and
play
jordan

both

thats
because
lankford
had

before

was
daytoday
only
available
as

later
in

ninth

with
the
bases
loaded

two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a

with

in

and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a

what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
see
above
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
torre
also
said
lankford
is
the
one
outfield
guy
whos
in
there
no
matter
what
my
guess
is
jordan
will
eventually
end
up
being
odd
man
out
due
to
low
on
base
percentage
whiten
was
a
great
acquisition
decent
offense
and
great
defense
in
rightfield
but
dont
worry
gilkey
will
be
starting
as
soon
as
jordan

whiten
displays
an
extended

low
offensive

not

pleasant
surprises
about
the
edition
of
the
bronx
bombers
so
far
first
the
pleasant
owen
all
through
spring
training
this
guy
was
looking
like
the
second
coming
of
mike
gallego
but
with
even
worse
hitting
now
the
guy
is
third
in
the
major
leagues
in
ba
and
hes
ranked
pretty
high
in
total
hits
and
runs
scored
i
know
its
still
early
in
the
season
but
he
and
pat
kelly
more
on
him
in
a
minute
have
provided
a
lot
of
spark
at
the
bottom
of
the
order
thats
given
the
big
guys
mattingly
tartabull
oneill
plenty
of
rbi
opportunities
lets
hope
he
keeps
this
up
kelly
the
guy
is
finally
showing
some
of
the
ability
that
led
stick
michael
to
label
him
a
star
for
the
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
but
kelly
looks
infinitely
improved
at
bat
i
guess
the
tips
he
took
from
boggs
in
spring
training
really
paid
off
huh
and
here
i
thought
boggs
would
never
do
anything
to
help
anybody
besides
himself
and
his
glove
like
always
has
been
terrific
he
and
mattingly
comprise
the
best
defensive
right
side
of
the
infield
in
all
of
baseball
imho
oneill
we
had
to
get
rid
of
roberto
kelly
partly
because
he
was
under
too
much
pressure
in
ny
to
be
the
next
barry
bonds
he
wont
do
that
in
cincy
either
and
partly
because
he
had
this
real
unprofessional
tendency
to
give
up
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
i
just
felt
that
we
couldve
gotten
more
for
him
than
oneill
well
so
far
oneill
is
turning
out
just
fine
he
looks
like
he
should
be
able
to
duplicate
if
not
surpass
mel
halls
numbers
from
last
year
and
he
keeps
opposing
pitchers
from
pitching
around
tartabull
now
if
only
buck
would
play
him
against
lefties
some
more
to
see
what
he
can
do
a
friend
made
a
comparison
between
wickman
and
jack
morris
they
never
have
impressive
stats
but
they
always
find
some
way
to
win
although
morris
seems
to
be
losing
that
ability
i
figured
that
wickman
would
be
the
least
important
part
of
the
steve
sax
trade
best
trade
since
we
got
that
ruth
guy
maybe
winding
up
as
a
good
middle
reliever
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretty
but
he
gets
the
job
done
whats
going
on
here
key
was
just
supposed
to
provide
the
rotation
with
some
stability
you
know
shore
up
the
left
side
provide
experience
get
maybe
wins
and
here
this
guy
is
dominating
everybody
he
faces
who
needs
maddux
or
cone
ill
take
key
any
day
and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surprises
owen
sure
hes
hitting
like
crazy
but
the
guy
cannot
field
to
save
his
life
and
they
said
he
was
brought
in
to
provide
defense
velarde
stankiewicz
and
even
silvestri
are
better
defensively
than
owen
remember
its
still
early
look
for
his
offense
to
tail
off
and
his
defense
to
improve
hopefully
he
has
that
rep
because
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
years
or
something
like
that
he
has
the
third
highest
fielding
percentage
among
major
league
shortstops
behind
cr
and
tony
im
not
gonna
help
this
sorry
mets
team
at
all
fernandez
i
do
agree
though
that
he
has
not
looked
all
that
impressive
in
the
field
thus
far
the
book
on
tartabull
was
keep
him
healthy
and
hell
produce
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
hes
hit
a
few
homers
but
those
were
all
solo
shots
and
he
hasnt
gotten
any
of
the
big
rbis
that
your
cleanup
man
is
supposed
to
give
you
then
again
he
had
a
slow
start
last
year
once
he
got
off
the
dl
that
is
and
turned
into
a
oneman
wrecking
crew

if

set
up
a

and
use
that
remember
i
only
post
final

the

once
a

other

every

i
supposed

down
just

it
was
meant
entirely
as

i
do
this
as
a

to
the

world
on

for
those
in

who
cant
get
final

in

this
is
helpful
to
fans
in

who
either
receive

by

also

have

for

it

i

i
dont

use

im

others
do

that
was
my
point
in

is
no

for

to

what
you
have
already
organized
if
you
want
to
send

set
up
a

use
that
remember
i
only
post
final

the

once

currently
there

i
do
know
that

has
been
accused
before

being

what
a

does

no

how
much

a

always

should
report

not

degrade

one
also
has

separate

into

baserunning
with
the
split
probably
somewhere
around
and
id
give
baserunning
a
little
more
credit
than
that
maybe
or
even
give
a
team
of
roberto
alomar
and
a
team
of
john
oleruds
identical
batting
stats
which
wouldnt
be
that
unreasonable
and
even
if
you
dont
let
roberto
steal
a
single
base
theyll
score
a
lot
more
than
the
oleruds
by
going
firsttothird
more
often
no
offense
gordon
i
wouldnt
give
baserunning
that
much
value
the
above
effect
is
clear
but
there
are
other
effects
as
well
if
olerud
hits
a
double
any
runner
on
first
will
score
if
alomar
legs
an
extra
base
onto
a
hit
in
the
gap
the
runner
on
first
may
need
to
hold
at
third
thus
oleruds
doubles
have
more
advancement
value
than
alomars
of
course
alomar
is
more
likely
to
score
after
hitting
a
double
another
reason
not
to
give
too
much
extra
value
to
baserunning
is
that
the
runs
created
formulas
work
for
very
fast
and
very
slow
teams
no
team
in
the
ran
much
but
some
teams
certainly
had
faster
players
than
others
still
the
current
runs
created
formulas
work
just
as
well
in
the
for
all
teams
bill
james
gives
the
senators
as
an
example
they
used
harmon
killebrew
regularly
as
a
pinch
runner
and
in
stole
bases
with
times
caught
stealing
yet
they
scored
slightly
more
runs
than
predicted
by

mr
hernandez

i
apologize
for
the
misunderstanding
i
explained
that
i
know
that
it
is
essential
for
some
fans
to
get
scores
here
for
they
cannot
get
them
elsewhere
i
have
no
problem
with
what
you
do
posting
scores
after
the
games
have
been
completed
however
like
i
said
earlier
i
dont
think
it
is
a
necessity
to
post
scores
during
the
middle
of
games
like
some
others
have
come

the

at

its

percentage
carney
lansford
has
a
best
alltime
but
fr
dead
last
of

time
also
since
this

compares
players
to

average
instead
of
replacement
level
robinson
should
be
awarded
an
extra
or
so
for
playing
more
games
he
had
a
great
career
but
i
would
prefer
santos
plus
years
of
a
replacement
level
but
i
would
knock
traynor
off
the

and
replace
him
by

hack
thats
a

story

far
better
hitting

traynors

graig

theres
just
no

baserunning
could
be

important
if
it

wouldnt
be
nearly
as

it

is
usually
about
accurate

theres
a

hits

disclaimer
this
is
for
fun
in
my
computerized
baseball
game
i
keep
track
of
a
category
called
stolen
hits
defined
as
a
play
made
that
an
average
fielder
would
not
make
with
average
effort
using
the
defensive
averages
posted
by
sherri
nichols
thanks
sherri
ive
figured
out
some
defensive
stats
for
the
second
basemen
hits
stolen
have
been
redefined
as
plays
kurt
stillwell
would
not
have
made
ok
i
realize
thats
unfair
kurts
probably
the
victim
of
pitching
staff
fluke
shots
and
a
monster
park
factor
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
we
replaced
every
second
baseman
in
the
nl
with
someone
with
kurts
out
making
ability
how
many
extra
hits
would
go
by
to
try
and
correlate
it
to
reality
a
little
more
ive
calculated
net
hits
stolen
based
on
the
number
of
outs
made
compared
to
what
a
league
average
fielder
would
make
by
the
same
method
ive
calculated
net
double
plays
and
net
extra
bases
doubles
and
triples
let
by
finally
i
throw
all
this
into
a
a
formula
i
call
defensive
contribution
or
dcon
basically
it
represents
the
defensive
contribution
of
a
player
i
add
this
number
to
ops
to
get
dops
defense
onbase
plus
slug
which
should
represent
the
players
total
contribution
to
the
team
so
dont
take
it
too

why
such

its
designed
to

the
idea
that

is

that
scored

i
would
be
happy
if
he
could
still

he
seems
to
be
suffering
from
a
total
callapse
bad
pitchers
are
more
prone
to
this
total
collapse
than
good
pitchers
they
are
closer
to
the
chasm
of
mediocrity
the
smallest
push
and
they
completely
lose

but
good
ones
can
collapse
somewhat

burleigh

went

after
his

source
bill
james
historical
baseball
abstract
and
lets
not
forget
john
tudor
who
started
and
finished
in
he
had
a
pretty
bad
era
when
you
take
busch
stadium
into
account
at
the
start
of
the
season
he
gave
up
early
runs
in
his
games
and
would
get
stronger
as
the
game
went
on
thus
giving
up
few
runs
in
the
last
going
he
stays
in
the
game
and
gets
the
win
how
else
would
he
have
pitched
so
many
innings
yup
he
used
to
dig
himself
a
hole
then
get
it
together
and
stick
in
until
the
run
support
eventually
came
through
this
year
he
just
hasnt
gotten
it
together
if
i
recall
he
had
a
era
in
the
half
and
a
era
in
the
half
of
last
year
hmmm
runs
in
innings
suppose
he
starts
more
games
and
winds
up
innings
pitched
if
he
allows
runs
a
game
in
the
next
innings
hell
have
a
era

so
at
the
end

i
think
i
have
his

right
this
is
going
to
be
hard
to
come
back
from
jack
may
be
finished
it
is
time
to
retire
or
be
released
if
he
does
not
return
to
his
form
from
last
year
his
million
contract
is
an
awful
lot
to
eat
my
hunch
is
that
morris
is
very
gutsy
and
that
he
may
be
pitching
through
an
injury
and
not
telling
anyone
my
guess
is
that
he
will
be
banished
to
the
bullpen
the
remainder
of
the
season
after
a
few
more
starts
perhaps
when

you

about

in

true
cone
is
probably
as

as
drysdale
and
they
have
no
koufax

still
these
teams
were
winning
with
home
run
leaders
who
had
very
bad
totals
with
lots
of
lowscoring
games
etc
and
they
didnt
use
relievers
whereas
jeff
montgomery
is
having
a
super
season
for
them
that
being
said
i
still
picked
them
or
so
but
i
think
a
superb
pitching
team
can
win
if
they
have
enough
hitting
theres
more
of
a
chance
of
that
i
think
than
of
a
team
with
tremendous
hitting
but
no
pitching
at
least
to
me
i
wonder
though
which
one
do
you
people
think
would
do
better
a
team
with
johnson
koufax
in
his
prime
seaver
carlton
and
young
in
no
real
order
as
the
starters
with
sutter
fingers
and
lyle
in
the
bullpen
but
with
a
puny
offense
assuming
good
defense
like
mazeroski
maranville
etc
or
a
team
with
poor
pitching
but
with
an
offense
of
cobb
carew
ruth
gehrig
mays
schmidt
wagner
and
bench
againyou
pick
the
order
i
would
postulate
that
the
pitching
one
would
be
several
games
better
by
seasons
end
even
the
best
hitters
can
succeed
only
of
the
time
in
their
best
years
but
a
great
pitcher
can
throw
lots
of
shutouts
taking
all
the
players
in

prime
they
might
throw
shutouts

wondering
about
who
holds
the

for

ina

the
answer
is
johnny
mize
in

with

and
the
yanks
he
hit
three
times
i
am
almost
sure
about
this
in

anyone
is
wondering
the
record
for
two
homer
games
is
held
by
babe
ruth
and
is
mizes
record
may
not
last
for
much
longer
because
of
juan
gonzalez
he
has
at

three
games
with
three
and
maybe
i
know
that
he
had
at

two

and

from

i
would

than
have
moeller
pitch
at
all
i
am
sure
simmons
was
ready
to
say
i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impressive
win
last
week
now
ottos
latest
debacle
has
restored
simmons
reputation
now
he
looks
like
he
is
back
in
his
form
when
he
had
the
als
highest
era
among
starters
four
our
sakenot
teds
sake
i
hope
he
pitches
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
tomlin
and
merced
are
a
bit
disappointing
they
are
still
doing
decently
but
considering
the
considerable
amount
of
talent
and
maturity
they
have
shown
their
first
seasons
they
seem
to
have
actually
gotten
a
little
bit
worse
tomlin
was
almost
unhittable
his
rookie
year
against
lefty
batters
merced
had
a
very
good
oba
his
rookie
year
he
showed
a
lot
of
concentration
at
the
plate
in
his
rookie
year
walk
well
he
seems
to
be
on
the
losing
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrved
his
contract
leyland
should
accept
a
part
of
the
blame
for
the
lavalliere
situation
i
cant
understand
his
and
managements
fear
of
losing
tom
prince
through
waivers
even
if
they
do
whats
the
use
he
is
aright
hander
like
slaught
not
a
very
smart
platoon
also
i
am
blaming
leyland
in
this
case
since
he
is
hcurrently
convinced
that
lavalliere
is
through
while
giving
him
way
too
much
time
last
year
in
the
regular
season
and
the
playoffsslaught
should
have
played
in
all
games
he
has
a
good
average
against
right
handed
pitching
didnt
leyland
and
simmons
forsee
this
last
year
and
attempt
to
trade
lavalliere
last
year
itself
any
fool
could
tell
them
lavalliere
wasnt
very
fit
last
year
dennis
moeller
is
scary
candeleria
well
he
is
not
going
to
have
such
a
high
era
at
the
end
of
the
season
maybe
it
will
be
in
range
but
million
plus
come
on
other
than
the
customary
home
run
giving
stage
patterson
goes
through
for
a
few
weeks
patterson
has
served
the
pirates
very
well
each
year
so
far
he
seems
to
have
pitched
well
for
the
rangers
i
think
the
pirates
should
have
spent
the
money
on
patterson
in
stead
the
rookie
batters
well
young
has
surprised
me
a
bit
with
his
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excellent
performance
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surprise
i
think
we
should
thank
doughty
for
that
rookie
pitchers
worse
than
expected
especially
cooke
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extension
last
year
now
his
value
has
increased
immensely
lonnie
smith
well
eric
davis
was
signed
for
a
comparable
amount
lets
see
eric
can
hit
better
he
can
run
better
he
can
field
better
now
why
didnt
the
pirates
go
after
eric
davis
an
injured
davis
is
better
than
a
healthy
lonnie
smith
even
if
lonnnie
smith
gets
some
big
hits
this
yearhe
wont
be
an
asset
he
has
looked
terrible
on
the
bases
and
in
the
field
management
big
big
zero
sauer
has
yet
to
make
a
forceful

would

could
have

cole
to
replace
two
of
the
four
outfielders
eric
davis
van
slyke
and
cole
would
have
made
a
very
respectable
outfield
even
without
eric
davis
thye
pirates
would
have
a
respectable
outfield
with
cole
svan
slyke
and
mercedi
think
he
should
hit
left
handed
against
lefts
in
stead
of
switch
hitting
simmons
did
have
options
for
the
outfield
ironically
the
biggest
accomplishment
of
simmons
tenure
was
getting
alex
cole
really
cheap
too
bad
compensatory
draft
picks
for
bonds
forget
it
the
pirates
can
rant
and
rave
they
will
not
get
those
picks
as
of
now
the
issue
is
still
being
appealed
now
if
this
doesnt
convince
anyone
that
simmons
and
sauer
are
idiots
nothing
else
will
on
a
final
note
tim
wakefield
wont
be
as
awful
as
he
was
in
his
last
starts
but
dont
count
on
him
pitching
like
last

for
the

also
if

was

who
said
morris
was

hey
valentine
i
dont
see
boston
with
any
world
series
rings
on
their

oooooo
cheap
shot
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
who
cares
he
had
two
of
them
before
he
came
to
toronto
and
if
the
jays
had
signed
viola
instead
of
morris
it
would
have
been
frank
who
won
and
got
the
ring
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
this
year
too
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
your
logic
is
curious
and
spurious
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
viola
wouldnt
have
won
as
many
games
had
he
signed
with
toronto
when
you
compare
their
stupid
wl
records
be
sure
to
compare
their
teams
offensive
averages
too
now
looking
at
anything
like
the
morrisviola
sweepstakes
a
year
later
is
basically
hindsight
but
there
were
plenty
of
reasons
why
it
should
have
been
apparent
that
viola
was
the
better
pitcher
based
on
previous
recent
years
and
also
based
on
age
frank
is
almost
years
younger
how
many
knew
that
people
got
caught
up
in
the
world
series
and
then
on
morris
wins
last
year
wins
are
the
stupidest
most
misleading
statistic
in
baseball
far
worse
than
rbi
or
r
that
he
won
just
means
that
the
jays
got
him
a
lot
of
runs
the
only
really
valid
retort
to
valentine
is
werent
the
red
sox
trying
to
get
morris
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
was
their
first
choice
afterwards
but
what
should
we
have
expected
they
would
say
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
division
more
like
if
this
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribution
by
viola

not

also
i
am

he
is

convinced
that
lavalliere
is
through

giving
him
way
too
much
time
last

should

leyland

forsee

lavalliere
wasnt

lavalliere

nobody
was
even
vaguely
interested
b
several
other
teams
had
made
it
known
that
they
would
grab
prince
who
was
out
of
options
c
lavallieres
release
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
being
through
he
was
released
because
in
the
event
of
an
injury
to
slaught
lavalliere
is
no
longer
capable
they
believe
of
being
the
everyday
catcher
since
slaught
is
as
good

how
do
you
know
this
did

say

the

heres
the

im
using

batting
strawman
fourth
because
the
primadonna
insists
on
batting
cleanup
if
this
is
true
note
that
i
dont
think
it
is
lasorda
should
be
fired
for
at
least
two
reasons
publicly
humiliating
his
players
knuckling
under
to
his
players
wishes
however
i
think
that
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
lasorda
wanted
strawberry
to
bat
fourth
and
that
you
hate

i
think
that

salaries
are
getting
way
out
of
hand
to
the
point
that
theyre
on
a
pace
to
become
severely
detrimental
to

so
you
want
to
decrease

so
you

in

i

made

why
viola
is
younger
and
is
left
handed
how
many
left
handed
starters
does
toronto
have
well
i
agree
that
viola
is
a
better
signing
however
why
does
everyone
say
that
you
want
lefthanded
starters
i
understand
lefthanded
spot
relievers
even
though
they
usually
face
more
righthanded
batters
than
lefthanded
batters
i
just
dont
understand
why
people
insist
on
lefthanded
starters
unless
there
is
a
park
effect
eg
yankee
stadium
most
batters
in
mlb
are
righthanded
so
righthanded
starters
will
have
the
platoon
advantage
more
often
than
lefthanded
starters
i
guess
one
argument
for
lefty
starters
is
that
certain
teams
may
be
more
vulnerable
to
lhps
than
rhps
however
this
is
probably
only
a
factor
in
the
postseason
because
teams
seldom
juggle
their
starters
for
this
reason
during
the
regular
season
i
think
you
just
want
the
best
starters
you
can
get
regardless
of
whether
they
are
lefties
or
righties
lefthanded
starters
tend
to
have
higher
eras
than
righthanded
starters
precisely
because
managers
go
out
of
their
way
to
start
inferior
lefties
or
perhaps
because
of
the
platoon
advantage

didnt

how
many

did
he
blow
in

all

therefore
i
would

made

oh
yes
definitely
therefore
morris
is
better
than

dont

if

trying

oh
sure
they
said
viola
was
their
first
choice
afterwards
but
what
should
we
have
expected
they
would
say
lou
wanted
morris
all
along
the
idiot
giving
the
man
million
to
play
with
is
like
giving
a
five

old
a
loaded
uzi
with
the
safety
off
the
only
question
is
how
many
shots
he
will
get
off
before
somebody
is
wise
enough
to
take
it
away
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the

more
like
if
this
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribution
by
viola
so
who
cares
i
dont
see
why
people
expect
boston
to
finish
sixth
the
bottom
four
teams
last
year
were
essentially
tied
boston
in
seventh
place
had
wins
the
yankees
and
indians
tied
for
fourth
place
had
wins
now
i
should
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
red
sox
improved
more
than
the
indians
or
tigers
basically
the
red
sox
are
stronger
this
year
at
dh
ss
lf
and
rf
they
have
healthier
starting
pitchers
so
far
at
least
and
better
relievers
i
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldnt
win
games
meanwhile
the
indians
are
in
shambles
and
the
tigers
still
have
no
pitching
they
will
win
some
blowouts
but
they
will
lose
an
awful
lot
of
games
too
maybe
the
sox
will
play
poorly
win
games
and
finish
fifth
but
i
think
third
or
fourth
place
is
more
likely

ive
never

i
have
no

hand
experience
with
her
ability

umpire
but
i
have
seen
her
on
talk
shows
and
her
point
seems
to
be
that
she
can
call
balls
and
strikes
as
well
as
any
of
the
umpires
and
she
knows
the

better
than

me
that

if
thats
how
she
sees
the

i
wouldnt

primary

has
nothing

im
going

wait
a

before
calling

i
am
sure
simmons
was

i
told
you
so
after
otto
had
an
impressive
win
last
week
now
ottos
latest
debacle
has
restored
simmons
reputation
now
he
looks
like
he
is
back
in
his
form
when
he
had
the
als
highest
era
among
starters
four
our
sakenot
teds
sake
i
hope
he
pitches
with
a
era
for
the
rest
of
the
season
yeah
right
i
expect
that
dave
otto
will
be
a
really
bad
pitcher
and
i
have
no
idea
why
simmons
ever
wanted
him
on
the
other
hand
i
expect
him
to
release
otto
if
he
doesnt
turn
things
around
pretty
fast
btw
ottos
game
score
for
that
ip
stinker
was
only
which
points
out
a
problem
with
the
method
since
ottos
performance
was
infinitely
bad
and
excruciatingly
prolonged
tomlin
and
merced
are
a
bit
disappointing
they
are
still
doing
decently
but
considering
the
considerable
amount
of
talent
and
maturity
they
have
shown
their
first
seasons
they
seem
to
have
actually
gotten
a
little
bit
worse
i
think
merceds
rookie
year
was
a
bit
flukey
but
arent
you
willing
to
give
him
some
more
at
bats
and
tomlin
a
few
more
starts
before
acting
so
gloomy
walk
well
he
seems
to
be
on
the
losing
end
tonight
but
i
still
think
that
walk
desrved
his
contract
no
he
didnt
walk
is
a
time
bomb
he
has
no
stuff
whatsoever
and
when
the
league
finally
realizes
this
it
wont
be
pretty
at
all
the
rookie
batters
well
young
has
surprised
me
a
bit
with
his
instant
impact
other
than
that
their
excellent
performance
hasnt
been
too
much
of
a
surprise
i
think
we
should
thank
doughty
for
that
dont
be
so
fast
doughty
is
the
guy
who
signed
steve
buechele
which
was
a
move
that
threatened
to
bury
kevin
young
in
the
minors
meanwhile
im
not
sure
whether
doughty
or
simmons
signed
martin
as
a
sixyear
free
agent
before
the
season
rookie
pitchers
worse
than
expected
especially
cooke
twice
through
the
rotation
and
youve
given
up
yikes
slaught
how
come
he
wasnt
given
a
contract
extension
last
year
now
his
value
has
increased
immensely
but
so
has
his
age
at
least
in
baseball
terms
the
useful
halflife
of
a
yearold
injuryprone
catcher
cant
be
much
longer
than
a
year
lonnie
smith
well
eric
davis
was
signed
for
a
comparable
amount
but
he
wanted
to
be
a
dodger
and
felt
he
had
something
to
prove
after
his
disastrous
i
dont
think
there
was
any
chance
for
the
bucs
to
sign
him
lets
see
eric
can
hit
better
he
can
run
better
he
can
field
better
now
why
didnt
the
pirates
go
after
eric
davis
an
injured
davis
is
better
than
a
healthy
lonnie
smith
he
certainly
wasnt

expansion
draft
its
annoying
but
since
leyland
seems
to
have
been
pushing
for
them
to
retain
jeff
king
it
was
probably
unavoidable
meanwhile
i
think
bigger
accomplishments
of
simmons
tenure
were
getting
some
value
for
john
smiley
not
trading
real
prospects
for
veterans
down
the
stretch
last
year
drafting
well
in
letting
the
rookies
show
something
in
foley
smith
and
candelaria
were
acquired
to
be
replacement
parts
which
means
that
even
if
fail
it
hasnt
done
serious
damage
to
the
bucs
future
compensatory
draft
picks
for
bonds
forget
it
the
pirates
can
rant
and
rave
they
will
not
get
those
picks
as
of
now
the
issue
is
still
being
appealed
does
this
mean
that
the
bucs
lost
the
initial
arbitration
case
i
never
heard
the
outcome
of
this
when
will
the
final
verdict
be
in
on
this
now
if
this
doesnt
convince
anyone
that
simmons
and
sauer
are
idiots
nothing
else
will
im
not
sure
who
was
the
idiot
in
this
case
so
i
dont
know
who
to
blame
it
might
have
been
doug
danforth
after
all
in
fact
i
seriously
suspect
it
was
doug
danforth
who
has
shown
his
willingness
to
call

at
exactly
those

the

jking
subject
re
dodger
question
the
dodgers
have
been
shopping
harris
to
other
teams
in
their
quest
for
more
lefthanded
pitching
so
far
no
takers
personally
i
think
harris
is
a
defensive
liability
and
he
has
also
led
the
team
in
past
years
for
hitting
into
double
plays
or
at
least
been
among
the
leaders
sharperson
showed
last
year
that
if
given
a
chance
to
play
every
day
he
can
get
the
job
done
if
sharpy
played
just
one
base
every
day
say
third
hed
also
improve
defensively
wallach
has
helped
tremendously
on
defense
as
has
reed
the
improved
defense
is
quite
noticeable
and
is
having
an
effect
on
the
pitching
staff
both
astacio
and
martinez
were
bailed
out
in
recent
starts
by
great
defensive
plays
martinez
pitched
into
the
ninth
in
a
game
that
might
have
seen
him
lifted
in
the
third
in
past
years
astacio
lasted
innings
the
other
day
under
similar
circumstances
the
dodgers
are
turning
double
plays
and
keeping
more
balls
in
the
infield
than
last
year
and
piazza
has
also
been
great
on
defense
he
has
thrown
out
of
batters
trying
to
steal
and
has
at
least
one
pick
off
at
first
wallach
clearly
has
contributed
to
the
over
all
improvement
on
defense
but
his
offense
is
awful
and
he
has
cost
the
dodgers
some
runs
but
i
dont
think
he
is
as
bad
as
his
current
average
i
suspect
he
will
come
out
of
this
slump
much
as
davis
and
straw
seem
to
have
come
out

admittedly
his

has

hes

id

you
do

racking

doesnt

of
shortstop
his
defense
was
so
good
that
hes
won
something
along
the
lines
of
gold
gloves
again
gold
gloves
are
mediotbiased
and
a
good
argument
could
be
made
that
larkin
deserved
one
or
two
of
ozzies
more
recent
awards
but
usually
this
is
tempered
by
someone
else
in
the
early
getting
the
gold
gloves
ozzie
deserved
earlier
in
his
career
ozzies
offense
you
ask
good
obp
great
speed
numbers
in
a
park
which
for
most
of
his
career
depressed
offense
admittedly
no
power
cept
against
tom
niedenfuer
but
still
a
definite
asset
offensively
yount
hits
mvp
at
two
different
positions
uhhuh
a
real
stiff
his
was
one
of
the
great
years
ever
by
a
player
in
recent
memory
and
probably
ranks
behind
only
the
peak
seasons
of
wagner
and
banks
as
far
as
ss
numbers
go
hes
a
clear
hofer
imho
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
well
as
far
as
garvey
goes
youre
right
garvey
is
a
mediot
candidate
pushed
because
of
his
winning
attitude
a
minor
factor
if
one
at
all
and
his
great
defense
no
errors
admittedly
but
the
range
of
a
tree
stump
garvey
shouldnt
be
in
the
hof
skyjack
ive
said
a
lot
of
nasty
things
about
skyjack
in
the
last
year
or
so
but
this
is
mostly
in
response
to
mediots
and
woofers
who
talk
about
morris
ability
to
win
which
is
nothing
more
than
morris
ability
to
pitch
when
toronto
to
score
tons
of
runs
at
this
point
morris
is
an
average
pitcher
although
from
his
early
returns
in
he
may
be
damned
close
to
done
but
in
all
fairness
morris
was
a
dominant
pitcher
in
the
for
upanddown
tiger
teams
while
was
obviously
a
great
year
for
detroit
the
rest
of
the
decade
the
team
was
generally
in
contention
but
not
favorites
morris
career
numbers
are
quite
good
and
worthy
of
hof
consideration
ryan
of
course
but
be
careful
i
guarantee
you
that
someone
will
throw
back
your
earlier
logic
about
yount
and
smith
being
shortstops
who
hung
around
a
long
time
after
all
nolan
never
won
a
cy
damn
hes
just
pitcher
who
hung
around
for
years
his
wl
record
is
mediocre
of
course
nolans
a
hofer
puck
probably
although
hes
got
to
play
reasonably
well
for
a
few
more
years
years
even
good
ones
arent
enough
to
make
the
hof
most
likely
that
said
i
believe
puckett
will
make
the
hof
pretty
much
regardless
of
how
the
rest
of
his
career
turns
out
barring
something
really
tragic
or
sudden
hes
very
popular
in
the
media
and
with
fans
and
legitimately
has
been
one
of
the
best
cfs
in
the
game
since
he
joined
the
league
ive
always
liked
the
guy
and
i
hope
he
does
make
it
and
in
the
end
i
think
the
puck
will
make
it
in
but
really
its
too
early
to
sell
this
debate
comes
up
rather
frequently
on
the
net
and
believe
it
or
not
i
never
tire
of
it
its

my
question
to
you
all
is
why
does
the
media
seem
to
embrace
the
theme
of
the
death
of
baseball
so
strongly
i
have
seen
articles
of
a
similar
vein
in
the
chicago
tribune
and
in
sports
editorials
on
tv
maybe
because
baseball
is
the
only
business
where
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
fiscal
aspects
of
the
game
preach
gloom
and
doom
these
allegedly
intelligent
people
seem
to
predict
bad
times
losing
money
bankruptcies
at
an
alarming
rate
and
theres
going
to
be
an
increased
degradation
of
the
product
they
produce
could
you
imagine
ibm
with
all
their
problems
promoting
themselves
the
way
major
league
baseball
does
their
stock
would
plummet
to
unthinkable
depths
not
that
they
are
too
far
from
it
now
what
would
happen
at
gm
where
would
gm
be
if
they
admitted
to
cutting
corners
and
producing
an
inferior
product
because
of
alleged
labor
problems
i
think
it
shows
a
lack
of
confidence
for
the
people
who
run
the
game
anyway
it
just
frustrates
me
when
the
media
says
such
things
because
it
inevitably
leads
to
owners
trying
quick
fixes
like
increasing
playoffs
to
satisfy
television
or
trying
interleague
play
to
drum
up
interest
forget
it
word
has
it
three
divisions
with
a
wild
card
is
just
about
a
done
deal
it
has
to
be
decided
soon
since

networks
also
have
to
begin
soon

i

all

is

have
however
i
do
have
to
protest
anyone
saying
that
all

fans
are
stupid
the
way
i
see
it
either
im
just
too
stupid
to
acknowledge
it
or
that
observation
was
just
plain
wrong
you
might
have
us
confused
with
bear
fans
anyway
about
a
two
weeks
ago
just
about
everyone
was
saying
that
the
cubs
would
finish
up
last
in
their
division
even
behind
florida
sheesh
these
same
people
were
predicting
the
braves
to
clean
up
in
their
respective
division
well
were
ten
games
into
the
season
and
these
people
are
a
little
less
vocal
now
i
wonder
why
well
the
way
i
see
it
the
east
is
up
for
grabs
and
whoever
wants
it
most
is
going
to
take
it
with
the
exception
of
florida
every
team
seems
to
have
good
batting
and
pitching
with
philly
presently
leading
the
pack
but
i
just
have
to
point
out
if
the
cubs
do
take
the
east
theyll
do
it
without
the
benefit
of
a
competent
manager
however
and
it
pains
me
to
say
it
the

jose
cansecos
swing
vs
was
going
over
some
videos
last
night
studying
and
videotapes
of
jose
canseco
proved
to
be
very
interesting
and
enlightening
heres
my
analysis
of
jose
canseco
circa
sep
and
jose
canseco
circa
june
hes
bulked
up
too
much
period
he
needs
to
lose
about
pounds
not
gain
more
bulk
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
what
would
i
do
if
i
were
jose
aside
from
salting
away
a
large
sum
of
a
cash
that
i
could
never
touch
so
that
id
never
have
to
work
again
id
restructure
my
entire
swing
first
minimize
movement
before
the
swing
close
and
widen
the
stance
and
severely
cut
down
the
stride
i
take
on
my
swing
hopefully
this
will
cut
down
on
the
time
i
need
to
swing
and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freely
second
drop
pounds
cut
out
the
weight
work
third
relax
the
wrists
will
cost
some
power
but
until
i
can
find
my
stroke
concentrate
on
keeping
the
back
shoulder
up
rolling
the
wrists
through
the
strike
zone
and
hit
line
drives
his
strength
is
more
than
enough
so
that
some
of
those
line
drives
will
get
out
of
the
park
if
cansecos
open
stance
and
resulting
bad
habits
are
a
result
of
his
back
problems
hell
be
out
of

the

find

one

pitching
is

implying
that
fielding
is
how

its

a

since
i
read

heres
my
analysis
of
jose
canseco
circa
sep
and
jose
canseco
circa
june
hes
bulked
up
too
much
period
he
needs
to
lose
about
pounds
not
gain
more
bulk
ive
been
saying
that
for
at
least
years
now
and
even
the
as
conditioning
guru
told
jose
he
was
carrying
too
much
weight
and
losing
some
would
help
his
backalthough
i
dont
for
one
second
believe
jose
used
steroidshis
back
problems
are
very
similar
to
problems
alot
of
steroid
users
experience
because
they
are
simply
carrying
too
much
weight
on
their
framesee
jeff
bregel
ex
as
a
textbook
example
and
imho
jose
is
too
big
for
his
frame
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
i
cant
imagine
how
to
estimate
bat
speed
but
its
pretty
obvious
that
jose
is
missing
fastballs
he
used
to
hit
likely
due
to
his
back
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
i
dont
know
he
had
an
even
more
open
stance
when
he
first
came
up
with
the
as
and
had
no
problems
with
it
then
it
might
be
that
preback
problems
he
was
quick
enough
to
cover
up
any
deficiencies
the
stance
caused
but
now
hes
lost
just
enough
bat
speed
that
the
stance
hurts
him
the
old
saying
if
youre
hot
its
a
trigger
mechanism
if
youre
cold
its
a
hitch
first
minimize
movement
before
the
swing
close
and
widen
the
stance
and
severely
cut
down
the
stride
i
take
on
my
swing
hopefully
this
will
cut
down
on
the
time
i
need
to
swing
and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freely
the
biggest
problem
imho
is
he
never
has
found
a
stance
hes
comfortable
with
for
more
than
a
few
months
he
changes
his
stance
so
much
he
loses
track
of
where
the
strike
zone
is
in
wednesdays
night
game
he
was
clearly
mad
at
strike
calls
on
both
corners
that
looked
pretty
good
to
me
i
think
he
no
longer
knows
where
the
strike
zone
really
is
because
hes
changed
his
stance
so
much
im
also
a
bit
concerned
that
because
hes
got
palmer
and
gonzalez
hitting
all
the
homeruns
hell
become
competitive
swing
even
harder
and
screw
himself
up
even
worse

so
i
can
hear

andor
wip
whenever
i

i
cannot
stand
wip
and
it
isnt
because
i
loathe
the
philly
sports
teams
the

are
my
favorite
nl
team
yanks
are
favorite
al
and
the

arent
too
bad
either
there
are
two
big
problems
emphasis
on
the
home
teams
especially
the
eagles
unlike
the
fan
hosts
who
can
at
least
answer
a
question
about
an
outoftown
team
if
a
caller
asks
the
wip
hosts
seem
to
have
no
clue
about
any
team
that
doesnt
play
on
broad
street
also
fans
periodic
sports
updates
every
minutes
gives
sports
news
and
scores
from
around
the
country
its
very
rare
to
hear
an
outoftown
score
being
reported
on
wip
hosts
with
the
exception
of
jody
macdonald
who
i
miss
from
his

at
fan
none
of
the
hosts
really
seems
to
have
both
a

a

presence
the
worst
is
gary
cobb

hired
solely

of

they
left
rbis
off
were
comparing
alomar
the
individual
with
baerga
the
individual
so
only
individual
stats
count
i
forgot
most
runs
are
scored
by
players
stealing
home
so
rbi
dont
count
for
anything
uh
right
you
also
forgot
that
you
cant
get
an
rbi
barring
a
hr
with
nobody
on
base
what
fraction
of
all
runs
come
on
solo
hr
most
runs
are
scored
because
there
happened
to
be
players
on
base
when
the
batter
did
something
good
i
use
the
phrase
happened
to
be
advisedly
lots
of
people
have
tried
to
figure
out
who
the
players
are
who
have
the
most
ability
to
turn
it
up
a
notch
in
clutchrbiwhatever
situations
and
what
theyve
found
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
has
such
an
ability
to
any
measurable
extent
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
people
who
tend
to
do
things
that
would
cause
an
rbi
if
there
were
somebody
on
base
end
up
getting
rbis
proportional
to
how
many
of
their
teammates
obliged
by
being
in
position
my
mistake
i
agree
me
too
rbi
are
a
worthless
stat
of
course
so
is
stolen
bases
because
sometimes
runners
are
in
front
of
a
player
that
would
otherwise
run
and
of
course
pitchers
pitch
differently
with
different
people
on
different
bases
so
batting
average
slugging
and
obp
out
too
hmmm
i
guess
homers
would
not
count
then
either
my
point
rbi
might
not
be
a
perfect
stat
but
nothing
is
and
no
stat
or
lack
of
can
tell
me
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
maybe
no
stat
can
tell
me
either
but
some
people
are
i
just
know
it

from
ian

derby
attn
those
who
live
inthe
philadelphia
metro
area
back
in
september
i
was
listening
to
wip
and
i
remember
the
morning
guys
were
talking
with
mayor
ed
rendell
the
topic
of
conversation
was
a
new
ball
park
for
the
phillies
the
location
for
this
new
park
was
suggested
to
be
near
st
station
at
the
time
the
mayor
was
optimisitic
that
in
the
future
this
could
become
a
reality
has
there
been
any
new
news
on
this
subject
or
is
it
still
a
pipe
dream
i
know
the
city
of
philadelphia
has
other
projects
ahead
such
as
the
new
convention
center
and
the
upcoming
spectrum
ii
but
it
would
be
nice
to
see
this
a
reality
it
is
planned
that
the
phillies
leave
the
vet
and
leave
it
solely
to
the
eagles
and
if
thats
the
case
the
eagles
should
make

hi
baseball
fans
so
what
do
you
say
dont
you
think
he
deserves
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
seriously
being
considered
for
it
as
is
lee
smith
ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chance
or
darrell
evans
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
takes
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddie
murray
and
jeff
reardon
i
am
trying
to
think
how
to
respond
to
this
without
involving
personal
feeling
or
perceptions
and
i
can
not
without
having
stats
to
back
up
my
points
however
i
think
you
approached
this
the
wrong
way
i
believe
all
of
the
people
mentioned
here
deserve
the
hall
of
fame
more
than
dave
kingman
does
i
feel
they
were
all
much
better
players
i
am
not
saying
i
fell
they
deserve
to
go
but
that
they
would
deserve
it
more
imho
dave
kingman
definately
not
they
guy
only
had
a
couple
of
years
were
he
could
hit
with
atleast
a
respectable
averag
the
rest
of
his
career
i
do
not
think
he
was
very
feared
by
pitchers
i
also
do
not
think
he
did
a
lot
for
the
game
i
mean
really
i
am
a
met
fan
he
was
a
met
for
part
of
his
career
and
i
still
would
not
back
him
for
the
hall
of
fame
dave
winfield
i
think
so
he
is
feared
by
pitchers
he
has
had
several
season
where
he
hit
for
a
respectable
average
and
his
production
numbers
are
in
my
opinion
without
stats
better
than
kingmans
probably
by
quite
a
bit
i
also
perceive
him
to
be
a
leader
maybe
not
as
much
as
some
other
people
but
none
the
less
a
leader
i
think
he
has
made
substantial
contributions
to
the
game
of
baseball
and
to
society
examples
of
this
are
some
of
the
charitable
things
he
has
done
i
know
some
of
this
from
when
he
was
with
the
yankees
i
think
he
the
type
of
player
that
kids
can
look
up
to
and
while
this
is
definately
not
the
only
criteria
for
the
hall
of
fame
i
think
it
deserves
some
consideration
lee
smith
maybe
i
would
have
to
see
his
stats
again
but
he
definately
would
deserve
to
go
before
the
likes
of
kingman
darrell
evans
no
eddie
murray
maybe
he
has
had
a
very
good
career
he
is
a
leader
although
a
silent
one
he
is
a
good
role
model
are
the
stats
good
enough
i
am
not
sure
but
i
would
once
again
believe
they
are
much
better
than
kingmans
both
the
average
as
well
as
the
power
numbers
but
not
as
good
as
winfields
just
think
eddie
did
not
have
as
much
publicity
for
most
of
his
great
years
jeff
reardon
my
guess
is
no
but
it
kind
of
depends
on
his
numbers
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
would
take
lee
smith
first
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall
of
fame
consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
well
i
strongly
disagree
here
both
of
these
guys
deserve
it
for
sure
i
talked
about
leadership
above
both
of
these
guys
are
leaders
and
have
been
instumental
in
leading
their
teams
to
the
post
season
robin
does
have
very
good
offensive
numbers
both
average
and
power
and
ozzie
has
okay
numbers
offensively
the
difference
with
ozzie
is
that
if
you
gave
him
a
home
run
for
every
run
he
saved
by
making
an
incredible
play
at
shortstop
he
would
have
shattered
aarons
home
run
mark
by
now
how
many
of
those
great
plays
saved
games
how
many
of
those
great
plays
motivated
his
team
to
rally
and
win
a
game
while
i
believe
both
of
these
guys
have
numbers
baseball
is
about
more
than
numbers
or
at
least
winning
at
baseball
is
about
more
than
numbers
both
of
these
guys
are
proven
stars
and
belong
in
the
hall
of
fame
as
does
george
brett
who
also
belongs
in
this
class
of
player
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
steve
garvey
i
am
not
sure
probably
not
but
i
guess
i
could
see
someone
making
a
case
for
him
jack
morris
once
again
not
my
first
choice
but
i
can
see
why
someone
might
bring
up
his
name
kirby
puckett
probably
the
only
reason
i
do
not
say
definately
is
he
still
has
time
left
in
his
career
if
he
continues
doing
what
he
has
been
then
my
probably
will
turn
into
a
definately
nolan
ryan
is
there
really
any
doubt
i
think
i
heard
something
about
him
having
some
records
maybe
they
were
not
all
good
i
dont
know
i
did
not
hear
any
of
them
just
the
number
he
has
the
numbers
he
has
the
contributions
to
the
game
and
community
and
he
is
a
great
role
model
i
would
not
say
that
he
is
the
best
pitcher
to
ever
pitch
the
game
probably
not
even
top
but
he
would
be
the
first
pitcher
i
would
put
in
the
hall
of
fame
because
of
his
accomplishments
nohitters
strikeouts
respectable
numbers
even
with
some
weaker
teams
you
can
go
on
and
on
i
really
hope
he
gets
all
the
possible
votes
so
in
summing
up
i
have
groups
those
that
belong
those
that
probably
do
but
i
am
not
sure
and
those
that
i
lean
towards
saying
dont
belong
at
least
not
without
my
seeing
stats
and
possibly
hearing
reasons
why
they
should
go
yes
winfield
yount
brettnot
in
your
mail
o
smith
puckett
and
ryan
maybe
murray
and
l
smith
no
reardon
garvey
morris
evans
and
definately
kingman
as
i
said
i
do
not
have
the
stats
around
so
i
do
not
have
numbers
to
back
this
up
these
are
entirely
my
opinions

ba
obp
slg
ab

bb

the
walks
should
give

away
obps
in

somewhat
more

and
alomars
edge
in
obp
was
quite
a
bit
larger
than
baergas
edge
in
slugging
im
no
sdcn
but
whats
more
valuable
hits
more
doubles
more
hrs
or
more
triples
and
bbs
lets
not
forget
the
extra
sbs
how
many
cs
of
course
the
hits
and
homers
are
more
valuable
but
dont
forget
the
outs
you
cant
have
it
both
ways
baergas
higher
raw
numbers
are
due
to
him
having
more
playing
time
and
thus
he
had
more
hits
and
homers
but
dont
forget
the
cost
of
those
outs
btw
just
to
answer
your
question
alomar
had
sb
and
cs
baerga
had
sb
and
cs
which
gives
a
minute
plus
on
alomars
side
something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his

id
say
you
could

the
only
category
that
i

about

clobbered

beat
him
in

by
a
lesser
margin
even
putting

any

factors
a

is
more
productive
than
a

with

the

has

you

they

the
fact
is
that
baerga
ate
up
a

more
outs

it

while
a

simply
doesnt

gee
can
these

if

if

no

re

a

in

a

it
was
reported
that
there
were
two
plans
for
a
new
phillies
stadium
the
alreadymentioned
street
station
proposal
and
a
location
near
broad
street
and
race
street
i
think
i
cant
remember
the
exact
details
but
the
stadium
would
be
build
practically
downtown
there
is
a
small
lot
that
could
be
used
according
to
the
paper
the
street
plan
has
run
into
some
trouble
because
amtrak
does
not
want
to
reroute
some
of
its
lines
in
order
to
accomodate
the
stadium
i
dont
have
an
opinion
just
yet
just
letting
everyone
know
that
there
are
really
two
options
being
discussed
right
now
neither
of
these
plans
will
be
put
into

very

re

one
last
infield

question
that
has
always
puzzled
me
and
hasnt
yet
been
addressed
i
believe
the
rule
also
does
not
deal
with
this
situation
if
infield
fly
is
declared
and
the
ball
is
caught
runners
can
tag
up
and
advance
at
their
own
risk
as
on
any
fly
ball
however
if
the
infield
fly
is
not
caught
at
what
point
can
a
runner
legally
leave
his
base
wo
fear
of
being
doubled
off
for
advancing
too
early
when
the
ball
hits
the
ground
when
a
fielder
first
touches
the

after

tell
you
that
the

never
led
the

by
that

going
by
memory
alone
i
believe
their
biggest
lead
was
games
and
they
were
ahead
when
the

began
a
streak
during
which
it
seemed

they
found
just
about
every
way
to
lose
known

man
anyway
i
think
they
rebounded
just
before

won
their

games
and
were
still
in

until

now
it
doesnt
appear
to
me
that
phillies
pitchers
bunning

were
really
overused
at
least
by
the
fourman
rotation
standard
of
the
day
until
well
along
into
the
losing
streak
at
which
time
mauch
was
probably
desperate
for
a
win
at
any
cost
because
the
phillies
substantial
lead
had
evaporated
the
way
they
were
used
at
that
time
may
have
made
the
problem
worse
although
bunning
had
one
of
his
sharpest
games
of
the
year
in
the
final
day
shutout
of
the
reds
that
cost
the
reds
a
share
of
the

bunning
pitched
a

sixhitter
striking

it
would
be
inetersting
to
see
though
how
the
total
innings
for
the
year
for
bunning
and
short
stacks
up
against
the
rest
of
the
league
also
notice
that
the

played
every
day
from
at

september
through
october

they
didnt

this

a

at

will

i

are

it

be

day
i

its

i
should

the
worst

joe
torre
has
to
be
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
for
anyone
who
didnt
see
sundays
game
with
a
right
hander
pitching
he
decides
to
bench
lankform
a
left
handed
hitter
and
play
jordan
and
gilkey
both
right
handers
later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
for
your
information
lankford
is
injured
i
think
it
is
his
shoulder
or
rib
cage
so
he
could
not
use
him
as
a
pinch
hitter
earlier
in
the
game
in
an
interview
about
acquiring
mark
whiten
he
commented
how
fortunate
the
cardinals
were
to
get
whiten
and
that
whiten
would
be
a
regular
even
though
this
meant
that
gilkey
would
be
hurt
but
torre
said
he
liked
gilkey
coming
off
the
bench
gilkey
hit
over
last
year
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
start
the
guy
would
be
starting
on
most
every
team
in
the
league
i
do
believe
that
whiten
was
a
very
good
aquisition
for
the
cards
he
does
not
have
too
much
offensive
capabilities
but
he
is
an
awesome
defensively
since
when
have
the
cardnials
actually
thought
of
offense
instead
of
defense
i
forgot
who
st
louis
gave
up
for
him
but
it
was
not
too
much
as
far
as
gilkey
is
concerned
he
is
a
leftfielder
and
so
is
brian
jordan
who
beat
him
out
i
expect
to
see
a
gilkeyjordan
platoon
in
lf
furthermore
in
sundays
game
when
lankford
was
thrown
out
at
the
plate
the
replay
showed
bucky
dent
the
third
base
coach
looking
down
the
line
and
waving
lankford
home
i
agree
with
you
on
this
one
as
soon
as
larkin
threw
that
ball
i
knew
that
lankford
was
a
dead
bird
but
how
could
dent
have
known
that
larkin
would
make
a
perfect
throw
i
strongly
believe
that
torre
is
one
of
the
best
managers
in
baseball
dont
forget
the
overachieving
cards
of
that
won
all
those
close
games
and
went
from
last
place
to
second
place
although
they
were
oveshadowed
by
the
braves
twins
last
to
first
climb
he
won
a
division
title
and
barely
lost
a
pennant
race
when
he
was
with
the
braves
why
atlanta
ever
even
considered
firing
him
i
will
never
understand
with
torre
at
the
controls
the
cardinals
are
heading
in
the
right
direction
one
more
thing
one
game
does
not
make
a
season
yes
they
lost
to
the
reds
but
with
the
second
best
pitching
staff
in
the
national
league
first
in
the
east
and
a
pretty
good
offense
the
redbirds
will
win
a
lot
more
than
they
lose
maybe
this
is
the
year
that
they
will
go
all
the
way

he
needs

not

his

absolutely

conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
i
understand
from
an
unreliable
source
that
canseco
was
considered
expendable
by
the
as
when
he
refused
to
accept
any
coaching
about
his
batting
stance
the
as
brain
trust
came
to
believe
that
his
back
problems
were
exacerbated
if
not
caused
by
having
a
wide
open
stance
closing
it
quickly
and
then
swinging
with
a
lot
of
torque
thats
a
paraphrase
of
what
i
remember
in
any
event
canseco
took
the
road
that
he
and
he
alone
would
decide
his
stance
and
the
as
began
to
believe
that
he
would
either
reinjure
himself
or
begin
to
lose
his
ability
to
hit
for
both
average
and
power
aside
from
salting
away

large

greg
from
ian

derby
no
hes
not
nuts
wip
is
second
to
none
the
sports
station
they
dont
have
tony
bruno
working
espn
radio
and
al
morganti
doing
friday
night
hockey
because
they
suck
i
live
in
richmond
va
but
i
visit
phila
often
and
on
the
way
i
get
wtem
washington
and
wip
i
hear
the
fan
at
night
wherever
i
go
the
signal
used
to
be
wnbc
when
they
played
golden
oldies
because
you
cant
avoid
it
of
those
three
wip
has
the
best
hosts
hands
down
chuck
cooperstein
isnt
a
homer
and
neither
is
jody
mac
wtem
is
too
generic
to
be
placed
in
the
catergory
in
fact
if
you
have
heard
wtem
and
the
fan
you
notice
the
theme
music
is
identicalsame
ownership
i
think
so
wip
is
totally
original
their
hosts
actually
have
a
personality
this
is
a
knock
at
tem
the
team
not
the
fan
because
mike
and
the
mad
dog
and
sommers
are
good
i
mean
comparing
the
morning
guys
in
philadelphia
to
the
ones
in
washington
is
a
total
joke
anyway
i
like
the
fan
and
wip
but
i
think
the
edge
goes
to
ip
when
i
get
back
from
philly
i
go
into
withdraw
cause
richmond
has
nada
except
the
national
sports
line
and
those
guys
are
totally
clueless
i
was
really
mad
when
wcau
was
cancelled
because
they
had
steve
fredericks
doing
sports
phone
after
the
phillies
games
wcau
is
another
strong
station
now
its
an
oldies
station
but
they
still
have
the
phillies
i
started
listening
to
the
fan
because
i
heard
he
went
there
i
finally
heard
him
last
summer
and
he
wasnt
the
same
guy
those
ny
fans
got
to
him
i
was
glad
to
hear
him
back
in
philly
when
i
went
to
see
a
few
eagles
games
i
will
admit
i
am
die
hard
eagles
fan
and
wip
is
basically
an
eagles
station
days
a
year
but
i
bet
you
the
phillies
are
in
control
right
now
about
the
knock
on
g
cobb
i
like
him
he
knows
the
eagles
like
a
book
i
remember
the
weekend
before
they
went
to
play
san
fran
when
everyone
thought
the
eagles
would
be
blown
away
cobb
said
that
the
eagles
usually
play
their
best
when
no
one
believe
they
can
win
well
they
were
inches
shy
of
pulling
the
victory
well
thats
my
from
ian

derby
since
someone
brought

give
an
opinion
which
city
do
you
think
has
the
best

coverage
in
terms
of

these
are
general
questions
is
the
washington

better

howabout

something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his
home
park
not
necessarily
it
could
mean
that
or
it
could
mean
that
he
just
hit
a
lot
better
at
home
than
he
did
on
the
road
see
frank
thomas
homeroad
splits
in
for
an
example
i
would
guess
that
some
of
alomars
split
is
due
to
the
skydome
but
most
of
it
is
probably
due
just
to
coincidence
theres
no
way
to
be
sure
of
course
but
the
only
hitters
the
skydome
seems
to
regularly
help
a
lot
are
right
handed
home
run
hitters
and
alomar
is
not
a
home
run
hitter
id
say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
being
about
equal
right
now
tp
rated
baerga
higher
actually
only
because
of
tps
bogus
fielding
stats
which
rate
alomar
as
the
worst
defensive
second
baseman
in
the
league
on
a
career
basis
i
think
tps
fielding
stats
may
mean
something
but
on
a
seasonal
basis
it
comes
up
with
ridiculous
results
like
this
alomar
may
not
be
the
god
of
fielding
the
media
says
he
is
but
he
sure
isnt
the
worst
in
baseball
offensively
tp
rate
alomar
much
higher
last
year
regarding
the
a
vs
b
argument
ill
just
say
theyre
both
very
good
players
with
different
strengths
and
a
bright
future

wednesday

yet
gerald
perry
of
the
cardinals
pinch
hit
in
the
eighth
inning
with
two
on
and
his
club
down
by
a
run
he
stroked
a
line
drive
into
the
right
field
corner
the
ball
cleared
the
threefoot
high
fence
and
went
into
the
crowd
darryl
racing
over
from
right
center
got
to
the
spot
in
time
to
reach
his
glove
up
over
the
short
fence
but
he
missed
the
ball
a
fan
sitting
in
the
front
row
wearing
a
mitt
reached
up
and
caught
the
ball
home
run
now
ive
seen
the
replay
several
times
and
i
have
concluded
that
darryl
missed
the
ball
and
that
the
fans
glove
was
essentially
behind
darryls
several
dodger
fans
with
seats
in
the
immediate
vicinity
have
claimed
that
the
fan
unquestionably
interfered
with
strawberry
what
cannot
be
disputed
however
is
that
the
fan
who
caught
the
ball
never
took
his
eye
off
it
he
was
oblivious
to
where
the
fielder
was
playing
he
was
also
quite
exuberant
as
soon
as
he
realized
he
had
made
the
catch
that
exuberance
disappeared
immediately
however
when
strawberry
went
into
a
tirade
at
the
man
all
reports
indicate
he
used
a
lot
of
profanity
and
accused
the
man
of
interference
and
therefore
of
costing
the
dodgers
a
game
shortly
afterwards
other
fans
hurled
food
and
beverages
toward
the
man
who
made
the
catch
dodger
stadium
officials
started
to
remove
him
from
the
park
but
then
relented
and
just
relocated
him
to
another

in

interview
after
the

lasorda
blamed
the

strawberry

went
into
a
tirade
about
how

they

times
columnists
similarly
blasted
the
man
who
made
the
catch
before
each
dodger
game
the
public
address
announcer
makes
a
speech
wherein
he
says
that
fans
are
welcome
to
the
souvenirs
of
balls
that
are
hit
into
the
stands
as
long
as
they
do
not
interfere
with
any
that
are
in
the
field
of
play
was
the
fan
wrong
should
he
have
been
more
aware
of
the
situation
and
acted
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
interference
or
was
he
human
and
just
reacting
by
the
way
he
is
a
season
ticket
holder
and
on
his
request
the
dodgers
have
relocated
his
seats
to
another
area
of
the
stadium
where
future
interference
is
impossible
others
have
questioned
why
darryl
should
be
so
concerned
with
what
the
fan
did
when
he
has
a
grand
total
of
rbi
through
the
first
nine
games
i
question
what
he
was
doing
in
right
center
with
a
lefthanded
pull
hitter
up
and
the
game
on
the
line
had
he
been
closer
to
the
play
he
certainly
would
have
had
a
much
better
chance
of
catching
the
ball
but
i
guess
the
big
debate
continues
as
to
what
are

gross
grosses
out
dodger
fans
again
went
to
the
dodgers
game
tonight
it
was
cap
night
astacio
pitched
ok
but
had
control
trouble
all
night
in
the
first
he
walked
a
batter
balked
him
to
second
then
a
single
scored
the
run
with
the
batter
taking
second
on
the
throw
home
another
single
made
the
score
cards
lasorda
tried
a
new
line
up
featuring
butler
reed
and
piazza
batting
third
darryl
and
eric
were
benched
in
favor
of
snyder
and
webster
piazza
homered
in
the
first
to
make
the
score
cards
the
dodgers
tied
the
game
in
the
second
on
a
two
out
single
by
offerman
by
the
fourth
inning
astacio
had
already
made
about
pitches
but
the
score
was
still
the
dodger
defense
made
several
impressive
plays
piazza
looked
great
behind
the
plate
gunning
down
a
runner
trying
to
steal
second
throwing
a
runner
out
at
first
who
had
strayed
a
bit
from
first
base
etc
karros
also
made
a
spectacular
play
keeping
a
ball
from
going
into
the
outfield
the
runner
on
first
was
so
sure
that
ball
was
going
through
he
just
kept
running
past
second
karros
got
up
and
threw
to
third
and
easily
got
the
runner
at
third
my
heart
sank
in
the
when
gross
got
up
to
warm
up
in
the
bullpen
astacio
was
lifted
for
a
pinch
hitter
and
when
gross
entered
the
game
with
the
score
still
dodger
fans
just
knew
it
was
over
gross
was
relieving
because
he
stunk
on
tuesday
pitching
just
innings
forcing
lasorda
to
use
much
of
his
bullpen
the
inning
game
had
the
same
effect
the
next
nightso
only
gross
was
fresh
given
his
light
work
out
tuesday
gross
lived
up
to
his
name
he
walked
the
first
batter
gave
up
a
hit
to
the
second
and
walked
the
bases
loaded
after
a
grounder
resulted
in
a
force
at
home
zeile
lifted
a
scoring
fly
ball
to
make
it
cards
gross
paid
little
attention
to
the
runners
and
the
next
thing
you
knew
the
cards
had
stolen
a
fourth
run
the
runner
on
first
was
eventually
tagged
out
in
the
run
down
but
the
run
had
scored
long
before
that
meanwhile
the
dodgers
mounted
little
offense
after
the
second
inning
lee
smith
pitched
the
ninth
he
had
little
trouble
getting
karros
and
wallach
does
anyone
have
trouble
with
wallach
these
days
cory
snyder
collected
his
first
hit
as
a
dodger
a
single
but
that
was
all
the
offense
the
dodgers
could
mount
smith
got
his
third
straight
save
against
the
dodgers
and
all
i
got
was
my
free
dodger
cap
and
a
good
look
at
piazza
if
piazza
keeps
this
up
all
year
he
will
be
a
strong
candidate

bear
with

ball
we
certainly
believe
this

is
going
to
be
very
good
some
day
but
there
is
really
no
need
to
rush
him

since
we
have

who

calling

lopez
time
will
come
lets
give
him
some
time
in
aaa
javy
lopez
has
proven
over
ab
in
the
minor
leagues
that
he
is
ready
to
play
in
the
majors
he
is
not
being
rushed
players
who
are
clearly
too
good
for
aa
and
play
behind
stiffs
at
the
major
league
level
are
wasting
their
time
and
may
actually
have
a
court
case
against
major
league
management
for
keeping
them
at
aaa
no
maybe
i
need
to
improve
my
writing
skills
lopez
who
is
very
ordinary
defensively
is
not
likely
to
hit
so
well
at
age
unless
lopez
is
me
defensively
im
and
born
to
play
second
base
he
belongs
in
the
major
leagues
training
what
does
he
have
to
do
to
earn
a
chance
maybe
not
a
full
time
job
but
at
least
a
couple
starts
and
a
few
ab
for
him
to
prove
his
worth
gee
i
dont
know
abs
sounds
pretty
good
to
me
about
as
good
as
your
reasoning
that
the
kid
should
play
a
backup
role
rather
than
start
every
day
at
aaa
talk
about
me
as
a
gm
valentine
isnt
saying
he
should
back
up
hes
saying
he
should
be
put
in
a
position
to
win
the
job
in
the
major
leagues
which
imho
he
would
if
given
the
opportunity
val
if
im
misinterpreting
please
let
me
know
so
far
you
have
come
up
with
two
arguments
against
lopez
he
is
very
ordinary
defensively
he
is
young
and
most
players
suck
when
they
are
young
the
first
is
irrelevant
hes
trying
to
make
the
majors
with
his
bat
and
the
second
involves
seriously
warped
reasoning
valentine
ok
most
players
are
not
ready
for
the
bigs
at
age
see
current
related
posting
on
clayton
one
of
my
favorites
most
players
benefit
rather
than
being
stagnant
or
hurt
by
playing
at
aaa
most
catchers
need
to
be
solid
defensively
players
to
help
their
clubs
in
the
bigs
those
are
the
arguments
against
lopez
for
the
braves
for
this
year
but
the
players
who
are
ready
are
best
and
the
ones
most
likely
to
benefit
from
being
in
the
majors
javy
lopez
is
not
a
middle
oftheroad
prospect
hes
the
real
thing
now
again
the
most
important
thing
a
player
can
do
is
hit
lopez
does
that
miles
better
than
olson
or
berryhill
if
his
defense
is
good
enough
for
greenville
or
richmond
its
good
enough
for
atlanta
if
he
really
was
awful
defensively
he
would
no
longer
be
a
catcher
see
sprague
ed
now
the
braves
have
two
catchers
who
have
demonstrated
solid
abilities
to
call
games
to
work
with
the
pitchers
to
throw
out
runners
not
superstars
mind
you
but
solid
experienced
veterans
the
braves
have
a
very
solid
lineup
with
two
big
bats
in
the
outfield
an
excellent
platoon
at
first
a
solid
mvp
candidate
at
third
and
one
of
the
better
hitting
shortstops
the
center
field
platoon
will
probably
hit
however
good
lopez
what
they
have
to
offset
the
differential
in
experience
and
defensive
ability
the
kid
will
improve
playing
at
aaa
and
he
probably
wont
being
a
reserve
with
the
big
club
oh
where
to
start
ok
first
of
all
solid
good
i
want
good
players
solid
is
one
of
those
words
used
to
describe
nice
white
guys
who
really
arent
very
good
at
baseball
think
of
it
as
twg
without
the
caps
its
a
losing
strategy
to
say
we
have
solid
guys
we
dont
need
to
improve
you
used
it
four
times
in
that
paragraph
btw
same
for
experienced
i
might
add
though
that
greg
olson
and
damon
berryhill
arent
exactly
carter
and
fisk
olson
has
played
three
years
berryhill
five
although
and
were
a
wash
the
only
difference
imho
between
olson
and
valle
is
the
supporting
cast
two
big
bats
hrm
i
like
justice
but
i
find
mr
gants
trend
disturbing
call
it
one
and
a
maybe
the
braves
platoon
is
ok
but
neither
player
has
any
value
outside
of
the
platoon
bream
vs
lh
and
hunter
vs
rh
are
awful

not
at
all
i
am
talking
about
morris
winning
with
toronto
last
year
you
are
about
to
launch
into
a
fantasy
about
the
red
jays
and
how
toronto
would
have
done
with
viola
on
their
team
viola
didnt
play
for
toronto
last
year
morris
did
the
problem
with
your
nihilistic
approach
roger
is
that
it
takes
all
the
sense
out
of
the
game
by
your
line
of
reasoning
if
a
guy
hits
into
a
double
play
with
one
out
and
the
bases
loaded
theres
no
point
in
saying
that
that
was
a
bad
thing
to
do
if
his
team
won
anyway
or
speculating
on
what
might
have
happened
if
things
had
gone
otherwise
so
the
double
play
is
merely
an
event
that
happened
in
the
course
of
a
game
that
was
eventually
won
or
lost
for
unknown
reasons
after
all
any
speculation
involves
constructing
a
fantasy
about
what
would
have
happened
but
didnt
roger
do
you
ever
worry
that
the
next
pencil
you
drop
will
fall
to
the
ceiling
instead
or
are
you
willing
to
consider
empirical
evidence
teams
go
to
the
postseason
when
they
win
more
games
than
anybody
else
in
their
division
if
they
dont
make
the
postseason
they
dont
win
the
series
will
you
agree
that
winning
a
division
is
a
useful
intermediate
goal
in
ringcollecting
if
so
you
must
agree
that
winning
games
is
a
useful
intermediate
goal
towards
winning
the
division
and
our
disagreements
come
when
we
consider
how
to
win
games
in
your
viewpoint
as
expressed
winning
games
happens
for
reasons
that
cannot
be
analyzed
while
many
of
us
are
thinking
things
like
base
runners
are
good
outs
are
bad
and
therefore
walks
are
better
than
double
plays
with
the
bases
loaded
you
are
thinking
things
like
its
a
team
game
so
perhaps
the
double
play
will
cause
some
mysterious
team
dynamics
that
will
cause
the
team
to
win
today
the
result
is
that
it
becomes
impossible
to
say
anything
about
individual
players
perhaps
atlanta
would
have
won
the
series
with
me
playing
left
field
after
all
perhaps
in
some
way
my
knowledge
and
personality
would
have
helped
the
team
more
than
my
complete
lack
of
skill
would
have
hurt
it
therefore
i
could
be
an
extremely
valuable
player
did
dave
winfield
have
anything
to
do
with
the
jays
victory
probably
but
how
do
you
know
if
you
replace
him
with
andres
galarraga
perhaps
the
jays
would
have
won
perhaps
they
would
have
lost
perhaps
they
would
have
defected
to
alpha
centauri
bearing
in
mind
that
the
flying
saucers
would
not
have
landed
in
midseason
had
winfield
been
dhing
for
toronto
was
babe
ruth
a
good
player
he
played
on
some
wswinning
teams
but
did
he
have
anything
to
do
with
their
success
it
is
generally
accepted
that
ernie
banks
was
a
good
baseball
player
and
jarvis
brown
and
dan
schatzeder
werent
it
seems
to
me
that
anybody
who
would
deny
this
needs
to
provide
the
proof
now
we
have
observed
things
about
baseball
over
the
years
both
empirically
and
by
looking
at
the
rulebook
it
is
necessary
to
score
more
runs
than
ones
opponent
to
win
the
game
so
it
would
seem
important
to
score
runs
and
to
prevent
ones
opponent
from
scoring
runs
are
scored
while
a
team
is
batting
and
an
inning
ends
after
the
third
out
so
it
would
seem
that
making
outs
is
bad
while
hitting
home
runs
is
good
players
have
tendencies
to
hit
or
pitch
at
certain
levels
and
these
are
usually
somewhat
consistent
from
year
to
year
we
do
use
these
statistics
to
predict
winners
and
so
do
you
to
make
some
flat
predictions
barry
bonds
will
have
a
higher
obpslg
than
gene
larkin
this
year
the
braves
will
finish
ahead
of
the
rockies
in
the
standings
the
tigers
will
score
more
runs
than
the
royals
but
will
also
give
up
more
i
would
be
astonished
if
any
of
these
turned
out
to
be
false
and
i
suspect
so
would
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
pretty
sure
i
can
predict
all
the
division
winners
this
year
given
guesses
per
division
and
this
is
certainly
better
than
random
chance
and
almost
statistically
significant
if
you
will
admit
that
the
rockies
and
mariners
are
unlikely
to
meet
in
the
world
series
you
must
admit
that
there
is
some
sort
of
way
to
measure
likelihoods
however
fuzzy
it
is
impossible
for
all
other
things
to
be
equal
so
your
fantasy
is
totally
meaningless
so
how
about

a

both

said
i
suppose
a
foul
ball
machine
like
brett
butler
is
pretty
valuable
but
id
rather
watch
and
root
for
the
lower
obp
guys
who
can
actually
hit
the
ball
now
this
is
a
legitimate
point
baseball
is
entertainment
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
people
who
find
certain
styles
of
play
more
entertaining
than
others
regardless
of
their
winvalue
personally
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
slugbunt
i
doubt
its
a
highpercentage
play
but
i
get
a
big
kick
out
of
it
i
am
willing
to
live
with
the
bad
consequences
in
exchange
for
the
fun
of
course
this
is
not
the
same
as
claiming
as
some
do
that
galarragas
inability
to
defer
gratification
isnt
hurting
his
team
because
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
or
is
an
rbi
guy
or
whatever
and
finally
id
like
to
point
out
that
many
high
obp
guys
draw
their
walks
more
because
pitchers
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
because
they
have
a
great
eye
im
not
sure
i
used
to
think
this
was
true
but
more
and
more
im
becoming
convinced
that
its
the
other
way
around
among
players
with
the
physical
ability
to
hit
the
ball
real
hard
the
patient
ones
are
the
ones
who
get
the
chance
to
do
it
a
lot
lets
break
down
the
four
basic
categories
of
hitter
according
to
whether
they
are
power
threats
and
whether
they
walk

etc
as
far
as
i
can
tell
all
the
categories
are
full
it
really
looks
like
the
two
are
independent
nobody
could
possibly
be
afraid
of
craig
grebeck
at
the
plate
and
yet
he
walks
quite
a
lot
part
of
that
undoubtedly
is
being
small
of
stature
but
surely
major
league
pitchers
can
hit
that
sort
of
target
at
least
times
out
of
randy
milligan
is
an
even
better
example
hes
only
shown
noticeable
power
for
one
partial
season
but
he
walks
all
over
the
place
despite
his
huge
strike

that
hed
been
thrown
out
and
gant
had
a
legitimate
beef
about
the
pitch
that
was
called
a
strike
a
reasonable
umpire
would
not
have
tried
to
force
gant
back
into
the
box
in
that
situation
a
reasonable
umpire
would
do
as
hes
been
instructed
to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
try
to
cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length
of
games
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
happen
and
hope
more
umpires
will
do
as
hirschbeck
did
in
instructing
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
so
what
if
the
previous
strike
call
was
bogus
its
in
the
past
it
cant
be
changed
get
back
in
there
and
deal
with
the
next
pitch
sorry
sherri
but
i
cant
agree
with
this
particular
incident
while
im
all
for
cutting
down
the
number
of
chainrattles
and
other
examples
of
rampant
hargroving
there
was
a
difference
here
since
time
immemorial
batters
have
complained
about
calls
so
have
pitchers
and
catchers
usually
nothing
happens
unless
the
league
notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing
complaints
hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
gant
said
something
about
the
call
stepped
out
of
the
box
and
turned
away
from
hirschbeck
as
a
hitter
alibet
of
little
consequence
but
with
a
decent
eye
whenever
receiving
the
short
end
of
the
stick
on
a
questionable
call
id
want
a
moment
or
two
out
of
the
box
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
rethink
the
strike
zone
based
on
the
experience
of
the
last
pitch
and
if
i
was
really
angry
at
the
ump
id
rather
turn
away
and
catch
my
breath
than
turn
to
him
and
say
something
that
might
get
me
tossed
especially
at
a
key
moment
in
the
game
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
at
that
point
cox
came
out
on
the
field
the
pitch
was
thrown
and
many
other
braves
left
the
dugout
cox
was
tossed
protecting
his
player
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
gant
kept
his
cool
enough
to
stay
in
the
game
its
a
small
sample
size
but
based
on
what
i
saw
in
that
game
mark
hirschbeck
has
a
hairtrigger
temper
and
a
need
to
play
god
on
the
field
not
good
qualities
for
an
umpire
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
for
future
appearances
of
hirschbeck
in
the
future
in
order
to
improve
my
sample
size
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire

we

since
there
is
no
absolutely
necessary
reason
to
make

i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
pointless
if
a
gm
is
trying

put
together
a
winning
team
he
might
consider
era
he
might
consider
attitude
he
might
consider
past
performance
in
key
situations
but
what
he
is
looking

is
not
the

that
he
considers
the
best
the
gm
is
looking
for
the
player
he

can

we
cannot

completely
roger
but
we
can
make
a
pretty
good
estimate
i
wont
claim
to
split
hairs
and
say
that
we
can
really
measure
who
was
better
robby
alomar
or
carlos
baerga
last
year
the
difference
is
too
close
to
call
but
larkin
and
lee
clemens
and
morris
the
differences
are
too
great
there
in
your
measure
of
the
game
why
should
a
team
that
has
just
won
it
all
ever
replace
a
single
player
since
they
are
now
clearly
best
how
can
they
do
better
yet
every
team
can
always
find
someplace
where
they
beleive
they
can
improve
the
team
they
can
always
find
a
player
a
little
better
than
one
they
already
have
btw
by
my
definitions
the
best
player
is
the
one
who
does
the
most
things
to
help
his
team
win
i
will
allow
that
this
could
vary
depending
on
who
else
is
on
the
team
by
having
aptitudes
one
team
needs
more
than
others
baseball
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individual
talents
it
is
absurd
to
judge
the
success
or
failure
of
an
individual
by
the
success
or
failure
of
his
teammates
whom
he
did
not
choose
at

in
most
cases

on

team
with
joe
carter
robby
alomar
tom
henke
juan
guzman
john

clemens
lost
because
he
was
surrounded
by
such
lesser
performers
as
herm
winninham
luis
rivera
and
jeff
reardon
to
define
the
quality
of
the
team
as
a
sum
of
its
components
as
i
do
albeit
imperfectly
is
a
lesser
error
than
defining
the

what
i

there
is
a
school
of
thought
that
suggests
that
silence
consent
i
agree
this
far
whereas
this
idea
may
not
apply
to
everything
in

it
certainly
should
apply

you

you

they
know
knepper
has
controversial
ideas
about

they
pop
some
question
about

an
interesting
related
question
would
be
whether
the
two
ever
appeared
in
the
same
game
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
guess
no
if
my
guess
is
right
knepper
popped
off
about
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
postema
gets
a
book
for
it
and
he
doesnt
now
of
course
you
dont
have
to
read
any
of
this

if

how

played

how

i
for

am
glad

hope
more

will
do
as
hirschbeck
did
in
instructing
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
a
reasonable
umpire
would
have
recognized
that
ron
gant
was
disturbed
with
the
call
a
reasonable
umpire
would
have
realized
that
there
was
a
game
in
progress
with
two
outs
in
the
ninth
what
ron
gant
did
was
try
to
regain
his
composure
what
a
normal
baseball
player
would
have
done
would
have
been
to
get
into
a
heated
argument
with
the
umpire
and
since
you
cant
argue
balls
and
strikes
he
would
have
been
ejected
from
the
game
ron
gant
by
trying
to
avoid
such
a
conflict
was
penalized
for
showing
some
restraint
incidentally
a
reasonable
home
plate
umpire
would
not
have
been
so
resistant
to
seeking
the
appeal
to
the
first
base
umpire
as
gant
requested
if
the
home
plate
umpire
had
appealed
to
first
the
first
base
umpire
could
have
wrung
up
the
strike
and
gant
would
not
have
been
so
upset
if
the
call
had
been
a
ball
and
the
catcher
had
requested
the
appeal
it
is
likely
the
home
plate
umpire
would
have
asked
for
the
help
finally
the
entire
game
was
pretty
much
a
mockery
of
the
socalled
efforts
to
speed
up
the
game
the
game
was
played
very
quickly
it
was
just
at
hours
when
the
stuff
happened
in
the
ninth
and
the
only
delays
in
the
entire

had

the

that
we

who
was
better
robby
alomar
or
carlos
baerga
last

the
difference
is
too
close
to
call
but
larkin
and
lee
clemens
and
morris
the
differences
are
too
great
there
in
your
measure
of
the
game
why
should
a
team
that
has
just
won
it
all
ever
replace
a
single
player
since
they
are
now
clearly
best
how
can
they
do
better
yet
every
team
can
always
find
someplace
where
they
beleive
they
can
improve
the
team
they
can
always
find
a
player
a
little
better
than
one
they
already
have
btw
by
my
definitions
the
best
player
is
the
one
who
does
the
most
things
to
help
his
team
win
i
will
allow
that
this
could
vary
depending
on
who
else
is
on
the
team
by
having
aptitudes
one
team
needs
more
than
others
well
then
given
your
definition
of
best
is
it
not
conceivable
that
alfredo
griffin
could
bring
something
to
a
team
that
that
team
needs
to
win
while
larkin
might
not
have
that
something
the
team
needs
would
griffin
then
be
better
than
larkin
baseball
is
a
team
game
but
it
is
made
of
individual
talents
it
is
absurd
to
judge
the
success
or
failure
of
an
individual
by
the
success
or
failure
of
his
teammates
whom
he
did
not
choose
at
least
in
most
cases
morris
won
last
year
because
he
played
on
a
team
with
joe
carter
robby
alomar
tom
henke
juan
guzman
john
olerud
et
al
clemens
lost
because
he
was
surrounded
by
such
lesser
performers
as
herm
winninham
luis
rivera
and
jeff
reardon
to
define
the
quality
of
the
team
as
a
sum
of
its
components
as
i
do
albeit
imperfectly
is
a
lesser
error
than
defining
the
quality
of
an
individual
as
the
mean
quality
of
the
team
as
my
reading
of
your
arguments
suggests
you
do
no
i
am
not
trying
to
define
the
quality
of
an
individual
at
least
not
for
the
purpose
of
ranking
them
toronto
won
with
olerud
they
might
have
won
with
fielder
they
might
not
have
won
with
thomas
detroit
might
have
won
with
thomas
chicago
might
have
won
with

you
cant
rank
these
individuals
you
can
only
look
at
who
might
contribute
more
to
the
team
effort
which
is
winning
the
ws
thomas
could
not
have
contributed
to
that
goal
any
more

may
get
pissed
at

but
theyll
get
in

once
anything
the

throws
while
theyre
adjusting

is
a

mandate
a
rule
permitting
only
n
seconds

the

clemens
hasnt
what
does
it
take
to
play
on
a
ws
winning
club
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
because
we
cannot
separate
morris
contribu
tion
from
the
rest
of
the
teams
there
is
only
one
way
of
determin
ing
best
in
baseball
and
that
is
by
looking
at
the
scoreboard
at
the
end
of
the
game
each
game
determines
which
team
is
the
best
that
day
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
team
that
was
the
best
the
most
often
is
the
best
in
the
division
the
playoffs
determine
the
best
of
the
best
but
the
point
is
that
the
only
decision
making
pro
cess
used
to
determine
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
lates
to
the
teams
not
the
individual
players
there
is
no
method
inherent
in
baseball
of
comparing
individual
performances
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
because
after
all
baseball
is
a
team
game
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
another
is
to
be
able
to
say
ab
solutely
that
player
as
team
would
have
played
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
speculation
impossible
to
ascertain
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemens
contributes
to
a
ws
cham
pionship
more
than
morris
your
evaluation
of
clemens
is
totally
sub
jective
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to
see
that
any
of
you
can
predict
a
ws
winner
with
any
greater
accuracy
than
jeanne
dixon
the
fact
is
that
morris
didnt
win
any
ballgames
toronto
did
in
spite
of
morris
contribution
this
has
been
explained
to
you
exactly
the
jays
won
with
morris
pitching
and
boston
wins
with
clemens
pitching
i
am
not
saying
that
morris
is
better
than
clemens
i
am
saying
that
individual
comparisons
between
players
are
totally
meaningless
and
that
anyone
claiming
that
clemens
is
better
based
on
his
era
has
missed
the
point
of
what
baseball
is
all
about
many
many
times
and
you
are
either
too
stupid
or
too
stubborn
to
grasp

you
dont
have

you
are
completely
consumed
by
the

fallacy
for
you
to
say
that
means
that
you
have
either
missed
the
entire
point
of
my
argument
or
you
yourself
have
committed
a
fallacy
ignoratio

i
am
not
saying
that
morris
is
better
than
clemens
because
he
has
more
rings
although
i
have
tongue
in
cheek
claimed
that
in
the
past
i
am
saying
that
it
is
impossible
to
isolate
an
individuals
performance
from
that
of
his
teams
for
the
purpose
of
comparing
that
individuals
performance
with

individuals

formance
the

are
a

hobby
and
thats
about
it

no

being

so
when
a

claims

is

appeal
if
you
look
at
it
though
baseball
games
last
around
the

the
difference
is
that
there
is
more

perhaps
if

money
i

at

the

theyre
going
to
stop
the
clock
after
made
baskets
late
in

next

and
theyre
going
to
a
second
clock
theres
also
a
difference
in
how
tolerant
i
am
of
long
games
if
im
watching
them
on
the
tube
and
if
im
going
there
in

for
me
going

become
a
major
commitment
of

one
that
im
not
willing
to
make
that

since
time
immemorial
batters
have
complained
about
calls
so
have
pitchers
and
catchers
however
batters
didnt
use
to
go
for
strolls
after
bad
calls
to
the
degree
they
do
now
unless
the
league
notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing
complaints
hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
everyone
was
told
of
the
new
emphasis
on
speeding
up
games
the
rule
that
hirschbeck
invoked
has
been
in
the
books
a
long
time
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
nobody
including
hirschbeck
ever
said
he
was
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
thats
your
perhaps
colored
by
your
partisanship
of
the
braves
perception
hirschbecks
view
was
that
gant
was
heading
off
for
a
long
walk
and
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
concerning
speeding
games
up
directed
him
into
the
batters
box
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
the
point
is
based
on
the
rulebook
and
the
umpires
instructions
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
request
the
braves
were
already
upset
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire
had
gant
done
as
instructed
you
wouldnt
have
remembered
the
name
of
the

of
interesting
articles
about
hispanic

including
its
hispanic

some
of
the
major
points
are
nprs
morning
edition
aired
a
report
this
morning
on
hispaniclatin
american
players
in
mlb
and
how
they
have
many
of
the
same
problems
faced
by
blacknegroafrican
american
players
when
they
first
entered
the
league
however
although
baseball
has
adjusted
to
the
presence
of
black
players
many
hispanic
players
still
labor
under
the
stereotype
of
being
fireballs
hot
blooded
flashy
the
report
also
emphasised
that
despite
the
rantings
my
word
of
jessie
jackson
about
baseballs
discrimination
against
black
players
in
its
upper
echelons
baseball
has
actually
done
much
better
by
black
players
than
hispanic
players
another
interesting
point
was
the
language
barrier
problem
the
reporter
elaborated
on
an
interview
with
ruben
sierra
which
he
gave
in
spanish
to
a
spanish
speaking
newspaper
reporter
with
the
fact
that
there
are
maybe
major
baseball
writers
that
speak
spanish
despite
the
fact
that
spanish
is
one
of
if
not
the
easiest
languages
to
learn
so
easy
that
the
author
cormac
mccarthy
learned
spanish
at
age
in
order
to
research
his
book
all
the
pretty
horses
yet
few
mlb
organizations
employ
spanish
speaking
personel
one
of
the
exceptions
being
the
oakland
as
another
point
nearly
of
latin
american
players
have
some
african
blood
yet
most
report
that
theyd
never
really
felt
black
until
playing
ball
in
the
us
ironically
enough
it
is
the
early
presence
of
latin
american
baseball
players
in
the
major
leagues
that
support
the
idea
that
baseball
was
integrated
before
the
arrival
of
jackie

many
light
black

clemens

clemens

morris

would
you
grant
the
proposition

preventing

from
scoring
increases
your
chances

winning
a

then
consider

right
whether

clemens

your

the
object

happen
and
open
your
eyes
for
once
and
look
out
there
and
see
what
is
really
happening
forget
about
how
morris
shouldnt
have
won
with
an
era
over
when
morris
pitched
last
year
the
jays
won
stop
crying
about
it
and
get
on
with
life
no
one
is
crying
the
jays
won
and
as
a
team
they
certainly
deserved
to
win
at
least
the
al
east
they
performed
well
in
two
short
series
and
won
the
world
series
and
i
congratulate
them
for
it
as
a
red
sox
fan
i
hope
they
keep
morris
i
was
happy
when
they
picked
up
stewart
and
elated
when
they
traded
for
darrin
jackson
you
see
unless
you
believe
in
some
mystical
link
between
morris
and
the
offense
you
can
hardly
help
but
believe
that
the
man
was
credited
with
so
many
wins
last
year
because
he
got
lucky
luck
runs
out
just
like
it
did
in
when
he
pitched
more
innings
than
gave
up
exactly
one
earned
run
more
than
in
and
went
seriously
roger
id
really
like
to
hear
your
explanation
of
the
difference
between
the
morris
and
the
morris
which
one
was
a
better
pitcher
and
why
did
morris
somehow
learn
how
to
win
in
the
intervening
ten
years
if
so
then
why
did
he
go
in

thats

i

background
stats

make

look

is
it
violas
fault
that
boston
had
no
offense
is
it
because
of
morris
that
the
blue
jays
had
such
a
strong
offense
dont
tell
me
that
morris
has
this
magical
ability
to
cause
the
offensive
players
to
score
more
runs
this
is
the
perfect
example
of
your
problem
you
are
isolating
violas
contribution
from
the
rest
of
the
teams
efforts
you
can
only
do
this
if
you
can
say
for
sure
what
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
only
then
can
you
compare
but
you
cannot
know
how
the
team
would
have
done
without
viola
your
analysis
is
fallacious
ok
how
about
a
straigh
answer
then
heres
a
very
simele
question
to
which
im
sure
a
fair
number
of
us
are
very
interesed
in
the
answer
to
please
answer
yes
or
no
roger
can
a
pitcher
cause
the
offensive
players
on
his
team
to
score
more
runs
al
only
please
for
anyone
else
following
along
it
is
a
wellknown
and
demonstrable
fact
that
a
teams
winloss
record
is
closely
related
to
the
number
of
runs
the
team
scores
and
the
number
the
team
allows
its
not
a
definite
hardandfast
function
but
there
is
definitely
a
correlation
in
fact
as
a
rule
of
thumb
if
teams
a
and
b
both
score
x
runs
and
team
a
allows
y
runs
for
every
runs
fewer
than
y
that
team
b
allows
it
will
win
another
game
so
for
instance
if
we
look
at
the
toronto
blue
jays
we
find
that
they
scored
runs
and
allowed
of
which
morris
allowed
all
other
things
being
equal
if
frank
viola
with
his
era
had
replaced
jack
morris
for
the
innings
morris
threw
plausible
since
viola
threw
for
boston
the
red
jays
would
have
allowed
about
fewer
runs
or
enough
for
more
wins
now
that
doesnt
take
into
account
that
viola
pitched
half
his
innings
in
fenway
which
is
a
harder
park
to
pitch
in
particularly
for
a
lefthander
than
skydome
so
um
roger
unless
you
really
do
believe
that
a
pitcher
can
somehow
affect
the
number
of
runs
his
team
scores
could
you
enlighten
us
to
the
fallacy
in
this
analysis
clearly
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
claim
that
viola
would
necessarily
have
put
up
a
if
he
had
been
on
the
jay
last
year
but
that
is
not
the
claim
we
look
at
what
the
actual
performances
were
and
evaluate
violas
as
better
than
morris
in
the
sense
that
had
morris
performed
as
viola
did
his
team
would
have
been
better
off
it
takes
an
open
mind
to
really
truly
understand
what

yes
everyone
seems
to
be

that
the

finally
moving
in
the
right
direction
they
should
finish
over
this
year
and
maybe
even
be
in
the
pennent
race
in
august
however
i
would
take
back
a
few
moves
the
jim
abbott
trade
i
think
abbott
is
not
only
an
inspirational
person
but
a
great
pitcher
also
he
could
win
the
cy
young
this
year
but
he
wont
because
the
right
side
of
the
yanks
infield
isnt
good
enough
so
why
was
this
not
a
good
trade
jt
snow
how
many
rookies
have
been
able
to
step
in
and
immediately
have
the
impact
that
he
has
had
so
far
on
the
angels
i
know
its
early
but
if
youve
seen
this
kid
hit
field
or
talk
you
can
just
tell
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
tremendous
player
the
yanks
should
have
kept
him
what
about
mattingly
you
ask
well
its
great
that
the
yanks
have
taken
care
of
him
and
remained
loyal
but
hes
years
older
than
snow
and
just
doesnt
have
the
same
bat
speed
as
before
his
back
injury
its
a
shame
but
as
a
yankee
fan
who
wants
to
see
the
best
yankee
team
id
take
snow
over
mattingly
at
first
the
yanks
also
gave
up
two
promising
propects
with
snow
for
abbott
besides
with
domingo
jean
brien
taylor
wickman
militello
and
sterling
hitchcock
they
are
just
loaded
with
propects
i
know
abbotts
only
but
this
was
too
much
to
give
up
i
believe
george
forced
this
trade
because
he
believes
and
hes
right
that
abbott
will
be
a
big
hit
in
ny
however
id
like
to
see
the
yankees
build
a
baseball
team
not
an
amusement
show
wade
boggs
i
live
in
boston
and
like
wade
a
lot
but
his
career
is
winding
down
and
i
would
rather
see
the
yanks
start
to
develop
a
long
term
solution
ie
hensley
muelins
russ
davis
velarde
besides
wade
just
doesnt
have
any
range
what
a
shame
about
charlie
hayes
huh
spike
owen
see
wade
boggs
id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
going
to
raise
the
yankee
staff
era
point
and
these
guys
are
on
the
down
sides
of
their
careers
danny
tartabull
yes
hes
put
up
some
tremendous
numbers
and
its
nice
to
think
about
what
he
could
do
if
he
were
ever
healthy
all
year
but
he
never
is
we
should
expect
games
max
out
of
him
meanwhile
gerald
williams
is
playing
at
columbus
and
paul
oneil
is
playing
left
field
i
believe
oneil
led
nl
outfielders
in
assists
last
year
and
tartabull
is
a
poor
defensive
outfielder
what
im
basically
getting
at
is
the
yanks
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
but
are
not
ready
to
win
a
pennent
this
year
they
should
at
the
gm
level
be
planning
for
a
or
world
series
this
means
getting
the
younger
players
experience
in
the
majors
now
so
they
will
be
ready
in
a
year
or
two
im
afraid
that
all
this
stuff
wreaks
of
george
steinbrenner
certainly
the
boggs
deal
was
all
george
it
looks
like
george
is
planning
the
right
mix
of
veterans
and
young
players
to
win
a
world
series
now
the
veterans
are
always
available
and
can
be
added
at
any
time
like
boston
did
this
year
develop
the
young
players
first
then
add
the
one
or
two
veterans
or
in
the
yankees
case
just
keep
them
lets
all
us
yankee
fans
hope
that
george
doesnt
dismantle
the
terrific
job
stick
and
company
have
done
building
the
yankee
organization
back
into
one
of
respect
im
really
afraid
that
he
will
trade
whoever
it
takes
to
patch
holes
today
relief
pitching
for
example
george
must
realize
that
the
yankees
rebuilding
process
is
still
one
or
two
years
away
have
patience
george
and
we
will
all
enjoy
the
future

sox
are
responding
to
them
and
not
to
al
bumbry
hobson
or
my
most
likely
suspect
new
hitting
coach
mike
easler
i
certainly
am
more
likely
to
give
easler
credit
for
mo
vaughhns
hot
start
than
clemens
or
viola
greenwell
is
hitting
as
he
did
before
his
injuries
this
was
the
optimistic
scenario
but
not
unreasonably
so
he
hasnt
shown
much
power
yet
though
dawson
is
providing
the
leadership
and
some
hitting
they
need
from
him
how
can
you
tell
that
dawson
is
providing
the
leadership
perhaps
its
calderon
perhaps
its
clemens
and
viola
maybe
hobson
is
finally
showing
those
people
skills
he
was
supposed
to
have
when
they
hired
him
or
maybe
its
all
a
myth
and
dawson
has
been
hitting
reasonably
well
but
not
as
well
as
greenwell
vaughn
cooper
or
fletcher
russell
is
finishing
well
in
three
games
why
dont
we
look
at
this
one
again
in
say
july
fletcher
is
hitting
well
as
a
leadoff
hitter
a
bit
better
than
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
but
dont
forget
that
zupcic
looked
like
wade
boggs
lite
for
about
abs
last
year
beware
of
small
sample
sizes
still
if
fletcher
hits
as
well
as
he
did
last
year
hed
be
a
great
improvement
over
any
sox
leadoff
hitter
from
last
year
be
aware
that
his
career
numbers
seem
to
indicate
that
he
puts
up
good
numbers
as
long
as
he
doesnt
have
to
make
more
than
ab
or
so
in
a
year
cooper
is
hitting
well
i
think
hell
be
better
then
boggs
in
the
field
and
just
as
good
at
the
plate
ummmsorry
no
i
can
buy
the
in
the
field
part
and
i
think
hell
be
better
at
the
plate
than
the
boggs
but
in
general
cooper
while
hell
be
a
pretty
good
hitter
couldnt
carry
boggs
jockstrap
with
a
little
luck
he
could
be
the
fourth
or
fifth
best
in
the
al
martinez
boggs
ventura
and
palmer
will
all
be
better
if
the
sox
pitch
like
last
year
they
have
a
better
pitchiong
staff
now
and
hit
like
they
are
so
far
they
coiuld
run
away
with
thee
division
but
since
i
think
that
their
hitting
and
pitching
may
not
be
up
to
the
challenge
of
running
away
with
the
division
i
think
that
they
win
be
over
and
at
least
third
if
not
second
or
first
see
here
is
where
you
make
that
quick
left
turn
off
into
the
aether
is
plausible
third
is
not
unlikely
but
phrases
like
could
run
away
with
the
division
are
likely
to
get
you
a
visit
from
the
men
in
the
white
coats
its
not
really
clear
that
their
staff
is
better
than
last
year
if
russell
does
well
darwin
doesnt
go
on
the
dl
and
hesketh
doesnt
pitch
just
barely
well
enough
to
avoid
losing
his
spot
in
the
rotation
they
could
be
better
on
the
other
hand
if
hesketh
pitches
miserably
and
theyre
too
stupid
to
move
him
to
the
pen
and
bring
up
conroy
or
somebody
fossas
continues
to
pitch
dismally
but
they
keep
giving
him
innings
becasue
hes
a
lefty
and
russell
explodes
they
could
be
pretty
bad

someone

some

about

even
if

you
have
to
consider
what
is
happening
on
a
teambyteam
basis
when
the
tv
money
dries
up
franchises
will
be
seeking
to
supplant
the
lost
revenues
from
alternative
sources
one
of
the
best
sources
may
be
ticket
sales
example
the
dodgers
the
dodgers
can
count
on
a
strong
base
of
season
ticket
sales
and
probably
believe
that
they
have
the
ability
to
raise
prices
without
hindering
revenues
i
certainly
think
that
is
true
example
the
padres
they
will
be
lucky
to
average
fans
a
game
this
year
if
they
raise
prices
less
if
they
want
to
increase
their
overall
revenue
base
the
best
thing
they
can
do
is
put
a
winning
team
on
the
field
but
given
that
wont
happen
it
wont
they
can
probably
make
more
money
by
lowering
ticket
prices
and
running
frequent
promotions
will
they
do
that
i
have
no
idea
but
they
wont
increase
prices
because
it
wont
work
for
them
even
assuming
that
you
have
some
strange
power
to
make
the
owners
decrease
ticket
prices
that
does
not
decrease
the
tv
contract
the
only
strange
powers
at
work
here
are
the
forces
of
the
market
place
each
teams
market
is
somewhat
different
and
each
owner
is
going
to
be
faced
with
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
about
how
to
deal
with
those
market
forces
as
a
buiness

i
would
never
want
to

my
prices

sometimes
that

is

and
sometimes
it

no
problem
with
the
length
of
games
at
all
and
am
tired
of
the
espn
crowd
and
other
announcers
bitching
about
it
i
have
never
been
in
a
ballpark
filled
with
people
looking
at
their
watches
and
shouting
hurry
up
if
i
cough
up
big
bucks
for
a
ticket
i
dont
mind
a
game
that
last
more
than
i
really
dont
understand
it
games
are
longer
now
for
several
reasons
more
pitching
changes
more
basestealing
and
throws
to
first
etci
think
a
very
small
factor
is
the
increased
time
it
takes
jose
canseco
deion
sanders
insert
fancy
showboat
ballplayer
here
to
arrange
their
jewelry
prior
to
stepping
in
the
batters
box
my
impression
is
that
sportcasters
and
writers
have
made
this
an
issue
because
they
like
shorter
games
they
get
to
head
back
to
hotel
bar
eat
steaks
get
drunk
tell
stupid
jokes
with
their
pals
and
chase
stewardesses
around
the
bar
sure
they
want
the
game
over
with
print
journalists
have
a
slightly
more
legitimate
reason
for
wanting
faster
games
they
have
deadlines
the
espn
guys
on
baseball
tonight
drive
me
crazy
they
constantly
harp
on
this
primarily
because
they
often
have
to
work
late
when
the
game
goes
longer
than
maybe
i
am
just
a
neerdowell
with
nothing
better
to
do
but
i
would
like
to
hear
reasons
why
the
longer
games
upset
you
as
a
parenthetical
note
it
seems
the
league
is
in
any
case
fighting
a
losing
battle
this
year
the
increased
offense
thus
far
will
certainly
spoil
any
hopes
of
getting
the
games
over
with
more
quickly

and
finally
id
like
to
point
out
that
many
high
obp
guys
draw
their
walks
more
because
pitchers
are
afraid
to
throw
a
strike
to
them
than
because
they
have
a
great
eye
this
comes
up
periodically
and
i
just
dont
get
it
take
for
example
mark
mcgwire
he
walked
times
in
if
thats
not
a
potential
great
example
of
what
youre
talking
about
then
i
dont
know
what
is
now
lets
look
at
what
happens
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
single
of
the
time
he
hit
a
double
of
the
time
he
hit
a
homer
now
youre
pitching
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walks
for
homers
double
singles
and
outs
i
would
why
give
him
the
base
when
you
can
get
him
out
times
out
of
then
there
are
guys
like
alex
cole
who
has
a
career
obp
even
though
hes
never
had
a
batting
average
over
he
did
hit
in
ab
in
or
hit
a
single
home
run
yep
thats
right
hes
never
hit
a
homer
in
abs
through
the
end
of
whod
be
afraid
to
throw
a

we
can
use
these
as

for

of
the

major
caveats
these

include
no

so
if
san
diego
really
is
just
a
question
of
odd
scoring
or
gopher
holes
in
the
infield
that
will
cause
some
inaccuracies
the
offensive
numbers
are
positionadjusted
but
not
park
adjusted
so
we
have
to
deflate
some
and
inflate
others
to
be
fair
finally
we
still

you

that
apparently
wasnt

darren

how

picked

in

last

i
certainly
didnt
but
id
have
a
hard
time
arguing
against
him
at
this
point
yes
i
know
these
numbers
are
only
approximate
but
thats
a
big
gap
between
him
and
the

also
those
of
you
who
thought
rickey

are
out

once

theres
a

if
calling

as
it
might

is
easy

my
personal

excluding

ventura
tettleton

im
a
big
frank

but
i
have
to
admit
to
a
bias
in
favor
of
balanced
offensivedefensive
contribution
which
should
have
a
higher
leverage
in
wl
record
than
an

that
is
lots

let
me
also
take
this
opportunity

i
was
grossly
wrong
regarding
don
mattinglys
defense
this
past

don
recovered
brilliantly
from
his
weak
and
to
end
up
with
mattingly

which
is
clearly
an

however
its
still
runs

watching
the

the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping

pitchers
taking
longer
between

excessive
trips

before
folks
jump
on
me
let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jays
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
yes
morris
is
crapping
out
big
time
this
year
but
lets
not
change
history
to
suit
the
present
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrassing
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
his
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrassed
from
where
i
sit
ill
let
others
have
the
excellent
players
ill
settle
for
good
enough

which

among

berg
was
the
principal
spy
for
the
oss
cias
wwii
precursor
spying
on
axis
atomic
programs
because
of
his
physics
background
and
language
skills
she
said
that
during
the
war
he
met
with
heisenberg
in
switzerland
and
had
instructions
to
shoot
heisenberg
if
the
germans
were
close
to
us
in
bomb
research
he
concluded
they
were
two
years
behind
and
didnt
shoot
him
i
have
heard
elsewhere
that
heisenberg
deliberately
misled
the
nazi
bomb
program
but
i
dont
know
how
reliable
this
is
unfortunately
npr
didnt

any
kind

certainly
buy
it
dave

there
is
a
great

out
called
they
also

which
is
about

there
is
some

on
berg
in
there
it
also
has
info
on
pete
gray
one
armed
outfielder
and
other
players
of
the
era
because
of
the
draft
many
players
during
the
war
were
those
who
were
exempt
from
the
draft
for
medical
reasons
there
are
some
very
interesting
stories
in
the
book
it
is
very
well
written
and
i
would
suggest
reading
it

the

i

it
was
a

different
being
me
of

i
used
equivalent

work
out
how
many

a

was
worth
and
i
calculated
both
rate
of
performance
fielding
equivalent
average
and
total
performance
fielding
equivalent
runs
but
i
compared
not
to
the
average
player
but
the
replacement
player
and
heres
why
because
the
positional
adjustment
comes
built
in
to
the
system
in
the
al
of
the
average
ss
is
runs
above
replacement
rar
cf

we
may
quibble
with
the
exact
numbers
but
the
order
looks
substantially
right
in
the
equivalent
average
i
have
always
set
league
average
to
i
had
decided
in

the
replacement

batter
has
an
eqa
of
the
name
of
that
replacement

hitter
often
as
not
is
billy
ripken
i
decided
to
let
the
replacement
level
fielder
be
the
same
distance
from
as
but
in
the
opposite
direction
as
i
have
set
it
up
that
makes
for
an
eqa
of
yes
i
can
add
runs
are
proportional
to
eqa
squared
the
difference
between
squared
and

equals
the
difference

and
i
rounded

an

this
comes
up
periodically
and
i
just
dont

it
take
for

mark

he
walked
times

if
thats
not
a
potential
great
example
of
what
youre
talking
about
then
i
dont
know
what
is
now
lets
look
at
what
happens
when
mcgwire
doesnt
walk
of
the
time
he
made
an
out
of
the
time
he
hit
a
single
of
the
time
he
hit
a
double
of
the
time
he
hit
a

now
youre
pitching
against
mcgwire
would
you
trade
walks
for
homers
double
singles
and
outs
i
would
why
give
him
the
base
when
you
can
get
him
out
times
out

didnt
say
that
pitchers
fear

throwing
strikes
to
guys
like
mcgwire
bonds
and
frank
thomas
was
rational
i
just
said
that
it

there
are

alex

has

obp
even
though
hes
never
had

did
hit

hit

yep
thats

hes

in

through
the

of
whod
be

i

alex

at

questions
how

he
does
he

rose
does

does

hitters

two
and

any
way
they
can

how

would
these

have

if

pitches
perhaps

i
doubt
it
if
you
tell
joe
carter
to
go
up
there
and
take
a
few
pitches
he
will
draw
more
walks
but
he
also
wont
hit
as
many
frozen
ropes
into

he
is
more
likely
to
hold
back
on

he

guys
joe
morgan
had
a
small
strike
zone
and
rickey
henderson
has
a

zone
the
size

heart
so
they
get
their
walks

a

would

corners
and
maybe
walk
these

that
to
throw
a
clear
strike
to
them
the
pitchers
would
do
better
in
my
opinion
by
just
coming
after
them
with
a
good
fastball
for
a
strike
on
the
first
pitch
but
pitchers
would
rather
nibble
go

line
and
in
the
umpires
judgment
interferes
with
the
field
er
taking
the
throw
at
first
base
the
key
word
in
the
rule
is
and
a
runner
isnt
out
just
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the
ball
or
throw
or
fielding
of
the
throw
to
first
because
the
catcher
opted
to
throw
the
ball
over
the
batterrunners
head
theres
no
inter
ference
so
what
is
your
definition
of
interfering
with
the
fielder
taking
the
throw
the
rule
book
certainly
doesnt
have
a
definiton
or
clarification
so
its
possible
to
interpret
the
rule
as
saying
that
if
the
catcher
has
to
alter
his
throw
to
avoid
hitting
the
batterrunner
then
again
we
have
interference
you
know
it
seems
that
there
is
no
way
to
apply
this
rule
justlyif
the
catcher
or
the
pitcher
say
rob
dibble
for
example
throws
toward
first
and
hits
the
runner
running
inside
the
baseline
the
fielder
takes
the
chance
of
being
ejected
therefore
he
probably
would
throw
around
the
runner
or
your
scenario
above
him
you
should
note
that
in
our
american
legion
league
which
uses
mlb
rules
we
interpret
the

to

in

there

jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
a
guy
who
threw
innings
with
about
run
lower
era
would
have
saved
the
bullpen
even
more
say
somebody
like
frank
viola
innings
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line

taken

of
your
account
i
seem
to
recall
morris
getting
at
least
or
wins
last
year
when
the
jays
came
back
from
behind
after
they
had
decided
to
pull
morris

hi
there
im
german
and
i
have
been
into
this
mlb
stuff
since
almost
one
year
now
there
are
many
problems
occuring
for
me
one
of
them
is
the
era
statistic
for
pitchers
what
does
it
say
era
indicates
the
average
number
of
earned
runs
attributed
to
a
pitcher
per
nine
inning
game
thus
if
a
pitcher
pitched
innings
and
gave
up
earned
run
his
inning
equivelent
perfomance
would
be
earned
runs
thus
his
era
is
to
compute
the
era
you
simply
take
the
number
of
earned
runs
divided
by
the
innings
pitched
and
then
multiple
the
result
by
era
erip
an
earned
run
is
run
that
is
given
up
by
the
pitcher
that
is
not
attributed
to
a
fielding
error
more
specifically
if
an
error
occurs
that
represented
the
third
out
all
runs
scored
after
the
error
are
considered
unearned
runs
earned
runs
are
also
runs
scored
as
a
result
of
players
who
were
left
on
base
when
the
pitcher
exited
the
game
here
are
some
examples
if
there
are
two
outs
in
an
inning
and
there
are
men
on
base
if
an
error
occurs
that
represents
the
third
out
all
of
the
runs
after
this
error
and
not
counted
as
earned
runs
if
a
pitcher
issues
some
base
on
balls
walks
and
leaves
the
game
before
the
inning
is
completed
he
is
responsible
for
the
people
who
were
left
on
base
if
the
those
runners
who
were
left
on
base
score
and
the
score
was
not
a
result
of
an
error
those
eraned
runs
are
attributed
to
the
pitcher
who
left
the
game

please

what
is
the
current

than
enough
time
if
the
pitch
isnt
released
in
call
it
a
ball
and
restart
the
clock
i
remember
a
post
from
last
year
indicating
that
a
pitch
clock
was
tried
in
one
of
the
minor
leagues
some
time
back
and
did
not
work
i
dont
remember
why
they
said
that
it
did
not
work
anyone
remember
this
jody
mcdonnel
on
wip
in
phil
has
been
saying
that
a
pitch
clock
was
inevitable
how
would
a
pitch
clock
work
on
throws
to
first
maybe
we
could
limit
the
number
of
throws
to
first
that
the
pitcher
can
make
and
award
a
balk
if
he
exceeds
it
id
have
another
question
who
would
operate
the
pitch
clock
one
of
the
umpires
add
another
one
to
the
crew
another
pair
of
suggestions
remove
the
balk
rule
it
is
the
runners
responsibility
to
stay
safe
no
matter
what
the
pitcher
does
im
not
sure
i
like
this
idea
i
think
it
would
severely
diminish
the
number
of
stolen
bases
and
limit
the
availability
of
such
neat
strategic
ploys
as
the
hit
and
run
and
the
squeeze
play
one
of
my
personal
favorites
if
a
pitcher
throws
to
an
occupied
base
more
than
x
time
x
to
without
successfully
picking
off
the
runner
the
runner
advances
a
base
as
if
walked
ahhh
i
suppose
i
should
read
the
whole
article
before
i
hit
the
f
key
eh
obviously
from
what
i
wrote
above
i
like
this
idea
the
nobalk
seems
to
give
the
pitcher
the
advantage
the
basewalk
allows
the
runner
to
challenge
pitcher
to
throw
over
to
the
base
it
may
also
increase
the
number
of
wild
throws
to
the
bag
since
the
pitcher
knows
he
doesnt
have
very
many
chances
to
pick
off
the
runner
so
he
may
hurry
too
much
id
rather
see
runs
scored
as
the
result
of
sound
hitting
and
sound
baseball
strategy
rather
than
on
the
sloppiness
that
could
result
from
this
kind
of
rule
so
i
suppose
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
that
idea
too
baseball
games
take
about
in
the
nl
and
just
a
shade
under
hours
in
the
al
thats
just
too
damn
long
i
dont
like
to
play

games
much
less
watch

i

surfing
when
i
know
that
it
will
be
enough
time
between
each
pitch
to
allow
the
batter
to
adjust
his
jewlery
i
remember
in
little
league
if
when
up
to
bat
we
stepped
out
of
the
batters
box
even
for
a
moment
we
were
automatically
out
that
may
be
a
little
harsh
for
the
majors
but
seriously
how
about
putting
a
limit
on
the
batters
being
able
to
step
out
take
several
dozen
practice
swings
pound
their
shoes
scratch
their
balls
etc
maybe
forcing
them
to
stay

wouldnt
be

male

it

jeez
look

everybody

to

if
you
even
watched
the

and
had
an
iq
greater
than
that

beef
youd
see
that
she
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
most

besides
she
is
probably
more
worried
about
cracking

years

i
was
an
enthusiastic
fan
of
nfl
football
last
year
i
hardly
watched
a

what
turned
me
off
were
the
incessant
interruptions
to
the
continuity
of
the
game
a
team
scores
minutes

aaaaarrrrgh
earlier

the

whom
i
believe
institutionalize
slow
play
i
dont
mind
the
catandmouse
game
with
rickey

in
fact
i
rather
enjoy
it
similarly
i
would
enjoy
the
battle
with
listach
or
lofton
or
polonia
on

what
i
object
to
is
when
such
games
are
played
with
karkovice
on
first
or
when
the
game
is
a
blowout
i
dont
mind
when
the
pitcher
steps
off
the
mound
to
gather
his
thoughts
in
a
crucial
situation
or
when
a
hitter
steps
out
of
the
box
to
regain
his
concentration
what
i
object
to
is
when
hitters
and
pitchers
take
such
breaks
at
every
opportunity
when
a
game
is
exciting
these
little
delays
serve
as
tension
builders
and
for
me
enhance
the
value
of
the
experience
of
the
game
when
the
delays
happen
with
regularity
they
become
nuisances
just
like
the
commercial
breaks
in
football
i
understand
the
nfl
imposed
a
number
of
rule
changes
to
speed
up
the
games
basically
putting
an
onus
on
the
officiating
staff
to
move
the
markers
and
the
ball
to
the
spots
faster
that
did
not
address
the
problem
of
the
continuity
of
the
game
it
may
have
appeased
the
sponsors
and
the
networks
but
i
would
be
amazed
if
it
did
anything
to
enhance
the
experience
of
the
fans
similary
while
some
baseball
games
bore
me
to
tears
those
are
the
ones
where
there
is
no
continuity
and
the
players
are
taking
exasperatingly
long
periods
to
get
ready
for
each
pitch
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
the
bravesgiants
game
cared
about
gant
stepping
out
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
that
game
would
have
found
that
pause
to
be
anything
but
an
opportunity
to
have
their
complete
attention
claimed

the

that
was
present
i
would

totally

disclaimer
this

keep

category
called
stolen
hits
defined
as
a
play
made
that
an

fielder
would
not
make
with

effort
using

averages
posted
by

thanks
sherri
ive
figured
out
some
defensive
stats
for
the
centerfielders
hits
stolen
have
been
redefined
as
plays
juan
gonzalez
would
not
have
made
ok
i
realize
thats
unfair
juans
probably
the
victim
of
pitching
staff
fluke
shots
and
a
monster
park
factor
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
we
replaced
every
centerfielder
in
the
league
with
someone
with
kevins
out
making
ability
how
many
extra
hits
would
go
by
to
try
and
correlate
it
to
reality
a
little
more
ive
calculated
net
hits
stolen
based
on
the
number
of
outs
made
compared
to
what
a
league
average
fielder
would
make
by
the
same
method
ive
calculated
net
extra
bases
doubles
and
triples
let
by
finally
i
throw
all
this
into
a
a
formula
i
call
defensive
contribution
or
dcon
basically
it
represents
the
defensive
contribution
of
a
player
i
add
this
number
to
ops
to
get
dops
defense
onbase
plus
slug
which
should
represent
the
players
total

hits

disclaimer
this
is
for
fun
in
my
computerized
baseball
game
i
keep
track
of
a
category
called
stolen
hits
defined
as
a
play
made
that
an
average
fielder
would
not
make
with
average
effort
using
the
defensive
averages
posted
by
sherri
nichols
thanks
sherri
ive
figured
out
some
defensive
stats
for
the
leftfielders
hits
stolen
have
been
redefined
as
plays
kevin
bass
would
not
have
made
ok
i
realize
thats
unfair
kevins
probably
the
victim
of
pitching
staff
fluke
shots
and
a
monster
park
factor
but
lets
put
it
this
way
if
we
replaced
every
leftfielder
in
the
league
with
someone
with
kevins
out
making
ability
how
many
extra
hits
would
go
by
to
try
and
correlate
it
to
reality
a
little
more
ive
calculated
net
hits
stolen
based
on
the
number
of
outs
made
compared
to
what
a
league
average
fielder
would
make
by
the
same
method
ive
calculated
net
extra
bases
doubles
and
triples
let
by
finally
i
throw
all
this
into
a
a
formula
i
call
defensive
contribution
or
dcon
basically
it
represents
the
defensive
contribution
of
a
player
i
add
this
number
to
ops
to
get
dops
defense
onbase
plus
slug
which
should
represent
the
players
total
contribution
to
the
team
so
dont
take
it
too

it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
i
dont
buy
this
at
all
i
think
things
are
colored
to
a
very
large
degree
of
preconceived
notions
of
who
the
players
involved
are
try
this
exercise
xxx
is
pitching
today
his
team
scores
in
the
first
inning
and
in
the
fourth
xxx
gives
up
in
the
through
in
the
fifth
he
gives
up
runs
in
the
he
gives
up
more
the
score
is
now
with
xxxs
team
still
on
top
i
contend
that
if
xxx
were
jack
morris
the
assessment
would
be
he
is
a
gutty
veteran
who
pitches
only
as
well
as
he
has
to
to
win
if
xxx
were
mike
trmbley
the
assessment
would
be
he
is
an
inexperienced
rookie
who
doesnt
know
how
to
pitch
needs
more
seasoning
send
him
to
aaa
or
to
the

it
was

at

in
viola
was

whereas
morris
was
healthy
at

i
didnt
really
want

either
i
was
more

you
surely
remember
my

relief
when
after
a

of
rumors
that
morris
was
coming
to
the

sox
they
ended
up
with
viola
instead
now
im
even
happier
viola
seems
to
have
rebounded
nicely
also
morris
was
willing
to
sign
for
only
two
years
the
jays
dont
like
to
sign
pitchers
to
longterm
contracts
which
i
think
is
a
sensible
policy
how
long
did
viola
sign
for
three
years
i
generally
agree
with
their
policy
of
avoiding
longterm
contracts
for
pitchers
but
i
think
they
enforce
it
rather
too
strictly
these
days
the
premier
pitchers
all
sign
three
or
four
year
deals
which
leaves
the
jays
with
morris
and
stewart
if
the
jays
want
to
compete
for
top
free
agent
pitchers
they
will
have
to
accept
greater
risks
any
idea
what
the
option

deal
is

are

are

the

the
point
is
that
he

so
far
its
that
he

hurt
them
eventually
just
as

as
he
hurt

the

fewer

as
someone
speculated

happen
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that

my

it
has
happened
for
the
past

where
have
you
been
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
license
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
and
make
outs
its
more
along
the
lines
of
hes
batting
and
leading

so
what
bloody
difference
does
it
make

thinking

alicea
hit
it

damn

tied
the

torre
obviously
knows
his

better
than
you
do
not
to
mention
that
lankford
had
been
hurt
two
nights
before
running
into
the
outfield
wall
this
being
the
reason
he
was
available
to
pinch
anything
his
ribs
were
the
problem
so
he
could
run
but
not
hit
torre
is
no
white
rat
but
give
him
credit
for
what
he
is
a
pretty
darn

the

usually
have

i
dont
think
they
have
a
backup
now
but
they
used
to
use
randy
kutcher
as
a
backup
catcher
as
well
as
a
middle
infielder
and
outfielder
you
dont
need
a
good
catcher
just
a
competent
one
so
you
can
afford
to
lose
a
little
catching
ability
and
pick
a
player
who
can
be
of
use
elsewhere

was

criminally
bad
the

six

cincinnati
was
with
runners
in

now
if
a
team
is
going

be
completely
without

they
absolutely
have
to

hope
that
this
comes
off
as
a
somewhat
unbiased
assesment
of
wfan
and
wipi
go
to
school
in
philadelphia
and
i
listen
to
both
stations
on
a
consistant
basis
now
that
the
fan
has
mike
lupica
on
from
to
noon
they
have
a
person
who
can
get
the
big
name
guests
for
interviews
and
not
just
of
local
importance
he
did
have
dave
cheketts
and
fred
wilpon
on
his
show
but
he
had
bob
costas
and
magic
johnson
on
too
now
here
are
my
opinions
of
the
two
stations
competing
talent
morning
show
in
my
opinion
i
think
imus
is
much
better
than
bruno
cataldi
and
morganti
even
though
i
would
feel
different
if
morganti
had
a
better
crew
of
people
to
work
with
to
me
wip
tries
to
copy
imus
but
make
it
all
sports
as
a
theme
in
terms
of
sports
imus
lacks
the
blanketing
of
the
airwaves
but
he
interjects
humor
and
politics
into
his
show
am
to
noon
i
think
chuck
cooperstein
and
lupica
are
equal
in
their
abilities
to
host
a
radio
show
but
i
think
chuck
has
the
advantage
over
lupica
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
caller
who
is
asking
about
who
the
local
team
is
going
to
draft
in
the
sixth
round
lupica
and
the
other
hosts
on
fan
get
better
interview
guests
but
i
heard
the
pd
of
wip
say
that
they
were
not
interested
in
interviews
with
celebrities
unless
it
was
a
major
story
i
would
consider
this
even
because
they
are
two
different
styles
of
host
noon
to
pm
at
this
point
i
would
have
to
give
a
big
advantage
to
jody
mcdonald
over
len
berman
because
lenny
has
only
been
on
for
a
couple
of
weeks
i
just
think
jm
has
the
ability
to
transcend
the
homer
mentality
of
the
philadelphia
fan
base
this
is
most
evident
when
the
igglesphiladelphia
spelling
play
the
cowboys
because
jm
is
a
huge
dallas
fan
where
else
can
you
have
people
call
up
and
predict
a
score
without
the
egging
of
the
hostsrewip
morning
guys
i
do
agree
that
jm
was
great
on
the
fan
weekend
overnight
and
i
miss
hearing
him
over
the
current
crop
of
rotating
hosts
i
feel
that
jm
is
the
best
sportstalk
host
on
either
station
by
a
good
margin
if
you
are
in
ny
and
you
cant
get
wip
jm
does
fill
in
on
the
weekends
sometimes
to
this
is
the
time
when
jm
goes
up
against
francesa
and
russofatso
and
froot
loops
and
i
become
the
most
divided
in
my
loyalties
mike
and
the
dog
are
very
entertaining
but
they
often
go
an
hour
or
so
without
calls
or
even
to
minutes
without
talking
about
sports
matd
do
get
great
guests
and
that
is
the
basis
for
their
show
so
it
is
like
the
to
debate
another
plus
is
the
appearances
by
mike
and
chris
on
imus
in
the
morning
which
are
often
hilarious
pm
to
pm
matd
go
up
against
fredericks
and
missanelli
i
like
mike
missanelli
but
i
just
cant
stomach
steve
fredericks
i
know
that
sf
came
from
philly
originally
but
when
he
was
at
the
fan
he
was
a
ny
homer
as
much
as
he
is
a
philly
homer
now
i
dont
listen
to
wip
much
after
pm
unless
there
is
a
game
on
that
night
but
you
will
see
later
for
the
reason
that
is
why
i
give
the
advantage
to
fan
pm
to
midnight
sm
are
on
wip
until
and
then
it
is
the
man
who
makes
eli
that
calls
matd
all
the
time
seem
like
a
novice
on
charges
of
racism
g
cobb
this
man
is
so
grating
on
my
nerves
that
if
i
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
i
go
nutsi
know
that
is
biased
but
listen
to
his
show
on
fan
there
is
usually
a
game
on
knicks
rangers
mets
jets
or
st
johns
basketball
if
the
game
is
on
the
west
coast
then
it
is
usually
howie
rose
of
course
i
think
dead
air
would
be
better
than
g
cobb
on
wip
but
wip
does
air
sixers
and
flyers
games
during
the
season
if
this
is
the
sports
station
why
did
they
lose
the
iggles
to
wysphome
of
howard
stern
in
phil
during
the
summer
it
is
all
talk

overall
i

they
sucked
they

having
a

year
but
didnt
get
any
respect
until
they
actually
won

is
how
it
should

until

at

have

they

prowess
by

especially
when
it

saying
that

havent

fan
i
will
simply
say
the
impossible
dream
year
for
those
of
you
with
short

short
lives
or
both
to
be
a
red
sox
fan
is
to
continually
be
the
subject
of
abuse
and
criticism
from
those
who
only
follow
the
hot

this
statement
is
supported
based
on
the
increased
number
of
brave
woofers
out
on
the
net
a
true
fan
of
a
team
any
team
will
follow
that
team
through
the
good
years
as
well
as
the
lean
years
and
be
amply
rewarded
when
the
time
is
right
yeah
so
what
if
buckner
let
a
roller
go
through
his
legs
in
who
cares
if
clemens
told
cooley
to
go
piss
up
a
rope
and
promptly
earned
a
quick
shower
the
fact
is
they
were
one
of
the
best
teams
in
the
league
those
years
and
the
fans
supported
them
now
that
it
appears
that
they
are
on
lean
times
the
number
of
detracters
come
from
all

what
let
them
play
and
we
will

what
happens
come
september
the
red
sox
may
not
be
that
good
but
they
are
certainly
not
that
bad
either
and
they
do
have
a

starting
point
and
look
how
good
a
fit
to
the
data
you
get
by
comparing
rbihome
runs
to
slgrisp
ive
started
with
team
data
using
data
from
the
eliass
that
ive
picked
up
over
the
years
when
a
i
could
afford
them
and
b
i
could
stomach
the
thought
of
increasing
eliass
profits
that
gave
me
the
years
and
i
dont
have
team
rbis
for
or
i
could
add
that
year
if
you
run
a
simple
least
squares
fit
to
the
data
you
get
rbihome
runs
the
correlation
between
the
lhs
and
the
rhs
is
which
is
significant
at
a
ridiculously
high
level
so
i
feel
like
the
fit
is
good
at
the
team
level
ive
no
started
to
move
on
to
the
player
level
and
have
looked
at
players
will
clark
ozzie
smith
joe
carter
and
don
mattingly
i
hope
to
add
quite
a
few
more
during
my
copious
free
time
this
year
it
doesnt
do
too
badly
except
the
equation
underpredicts
the
low
hr
hitter
smith
which
may
be

of
the
model
or
it
could

be
ozzie
the

i
think
we
can

i

from
knowing
how

how

if

youd

this

what
everyone

im
really
looking

for
thomas

who
did

the

was

the

was
there
sure
i

go

i

lopez
is
anywhere
near
as
talented
as
thomas
was

his
aa

i
am

nearly

frankly
i

why
he
didnt

the

in
bones
is
a

younger

one
of
the
chapters
in

thorns
hidden
game
is
titled
pitching
is
of
baseball
implying
that
fielding
is
how
do
they
determine
that
beats
me
its
been
a
long
long
time
since
i
read
it
this
was
my
opinion
the
stupidest
thing
in
the
hidden
game
the
argument
was
defense
or
runs
allowed
is
of
the
game
unearned
runs
amount
to
of
the
runs
allowed
earned
runs
since
unearned
runs
are
the
result
of
fielding
not
pitching
and
earned
runs
are
the
product
of
pitching
not
fielding
fielding
is
of
defense
and
pitching
is
of
defense
caombining
with
pitching
is
of
the
game
fielding
pete
is
usually
sharper
than
that
my
own
feel
is
that
fielding
is
in
the
of
defense
range
call
it
between
fielding
and
pitching
one
also
has
to
separate
offense
into
batting
and
baserunning
with
the
split
probably
somewhere
around
and
id
give
baserunning
a
little
more
credit
than
that
maybe
or
even
give
a
team
of
roberto
alomar
and
a
team
of
john
oleruds
identical
batting
stats
which
wouldnt
be
that
unreasonable
and
even
if
you
dont
let
roberto
steal
a
single
base
theyll
score
a
lot
more

the
oleruds

going

funny
it
seems
to
me
that
the
stats
major
league
and
minor

handbooks
which
are
nothing
but
collections
of
statistics
are
authored
by
bill

and

and
howe
for
the
minor
league
handbook
and
i
am
not
sure
how
the
bill
james
player

book
qualifies
as
a
book
with
statistics
while
the
elias
analyst
is
a
statistics
book
the
analyst
contains
more
stats
sure
but
it
also
contains
more
dialogue
finally
the
point
was
not
about
the
word
statistics
it
was
about
moneygrubbing
i
dont
see
how
anyone
who
has
looked

cannot
consider

some
thoughts

facts
bill
james
is
a
partial
owner
of
stats

however
he
has
almost
nothing
to
do
with
the
daytoday
operations
of
the
company
although
he
does
have
significant
input
into
the
design
of
the
books
that
bear
his
name
the
handbook
but
not
the
scoreboard
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
only
things
that
bill
actually
writes
for
stats
are
the
predictions
section
of
the
handbook
and
the
bill
james
fantasy
baseball
rulebook
the
debate
over
elias
goes
way
back
bill
james
early
stuff
was
hampered
by
the
fact
that
elias
would
not
give
access
to
their
stats
at
any
price
project
scoresheet
and
later
stats
were
founded
to
fill
this
void
you
can
call
stats
and
ask
them
for
a
report
on
just
about
anything
in
their
database
and
they
will
provide
it
for
a
price
of
course
or
you
could
just
log
into
their
online
system
and
look
at
the
data
yourself
having
attempted
to
pry
numbers
from
elias
in
the
past
football
not
baseball
they
just
dont
do
that
in
stats
eyes
the
high
ground
comes
from
making
the
information
available
at
all
that
being
said
im
pretty
dissapointed
by
bills
book
this
year
too
i
am
given
to
understant
that
it
was
mostly
a
response
to
the
publishers
desire
to
have
the
book
come
out
sooner
than
april
hope
this
makes
things
just
a

so
no

bad
he

i
still

it
was

just
from
the
perspective

team
chemistry
i
laugh

you

i
will
laugh
at
you
again
equally
publicly
when

due

the

the
jays
will
finish
third
because
of
the
depletion
of
their
pitching
staff
not
because
derek
bell
was
traded
for
darrin
jakson
i
couldnt
agree
more
the
jays
have
a
lot
of
power
in
their
lineup
so
far
pitching
has
been
the
biggest
problem
maybe
we
can
get
acker
back
but
anyway
the
point
of
my
post
if
you
missed
it
was
that
derek
bell
was
traded
because
he
was
basically
in
the
doghouse
with
cito
and
the
rest
of
the
team
one
incident
that
sticks
out
in
my
mind
was
when
derek
bell
ran
back
out
on
to
the
feild
after
the
jays
had
won
the
division
and
all
the
players
were
back
in
the
clubhouse
bell
ran
around
the
field
with
his
arms
in
the
air
waving
a
big
towel
over
his
head
he
looked
like
a
big
jerk
especially
when
you
consider
he
did
not
contribute
much
to
the
team
over
the
whole
season
the
next
day
winfield
and
carter
somehow
got
the
keys
to
bells
jeep
and
brought
it
out
on
to
the
feild
before
the
game
started
the
stadium
announcer
said
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
draw
later
in
the
game
for
bells
jeep
bell
really
freaked
out
i
dont
think
bell
was
to
popular
after
that
i
think
that
jackson
might
be
trying
a
little
too
hard
right
now
hes
known
for
being
a
great
outfielder
and
hes
not
the

this

early
and
often
by
the
heavily
rightunbalanced
reds
lineup
which
managed
some
recently
rare
power
with
their

belcher
was
solid
throughout
and
in
fact
seemed
to
get
stronger
as
the
game
progressed
early
on
he
had
several
threeball
counts
but
even
those
were
few
and
far
between
later
on
as
he
allowed
only
one
baseonballs
while
striking
out
nine
in
a
post
game
interview
he
said
his
changeup
was
working
for
himi
should
say
so
all
nine
of
his
strikeouts
were
apparently
on
breaking
balls

on
the
other

was
in

early
giving
up
a
secondpitch

batter
bip
roberts
bobby

followed
with

and
barry
larkin
scored
roberts
with

single
to
right
the
big
guys
mitchell
sabo
milligan
were
unable
to
get
anything
after
thatin
fact
they
all
struck
outbut
kelly
managed
a
score
anyway
due
to
a
doublesteal
and
a
tomlin
wild
pitch
in
fact
it
appeared
that
tomlin
was
going
to
recover
nicely
from
his
shaky
start
he
retired
of
the
next
batters
to
get
to
the
fourth
behind
only
randy
milligan
though
had
different
ideas
as
his
lineshot
was
poorly
played
by
orlando
merced
and
turned
into
a
triple
milligan
would
later
score
on
reggie
sanders
sacrifice
fly
giving
cinci
the
lead
after
the
fifth
inning
spelled
loss
for
tomlin
when
roberts
led
off
with
his
second
double
of
the
game
and
one
batter
later
larkin
smacked
a
double
down
the
left
field
line
chasing
tomlin
barry

would
score
the

the

managed
their

of

in

but
if

the

probably
would

my
impression
was
that
gant
was
not
stepping
out
he
was
making
a
protest
about
the
lack
of
an

to

as
has
been
pointed
out

there
is
no
appeal

i
can
understand
gant
feeling
a

pressure
in

ninth

he
let
it
get
to
him
the

also
overreacted
gant

i
doubt
he
would
have
been
gone
long
hirschbeck
should
have
let
him
have
a
moment
to
compose
himself
before
telling
him
to
come
bat
imho
umpires
should
be
more
flexible
than
what
hirschbeck
showed
gant
was
disturbed
to
the

it

i

in

at

the
wind
kicked
up
a
little
too
and
i
got
this
idea
at

games
theres
a
pile
of
hot
dog
wrappers

cups
and
trash
on
the

a

propose
a

of

old
kids
who
would
love
nothing
better
than
to
run
out
on

when
the
guy
in

toro
smooths
the
infield

grab
the
trash
it

before
folks
jump
on
me
let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jays
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
well
when
you
say
without
morris
you
have
to
mention
an
assumed
replacement
if
the
alternative
to
morris
was
letting
cito
gaston
softtoss
the
ball
underhand
to
the
opposition
every
days
then
of
course
the
blue
jays
wouldnt
have
won
without
morris
if
the
alternative
was
replacement
level
then
i
think
it
wouldve
been
very
close
and
yes
morris
mightve
made
the
difference
if
the
alternative
was
frank
viola
the
blue
jays
probably
would
have
won
more
easily
with
viola
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
yes
you
can
make
the
argument
that
the
his
presence
prevented
the
team
from
collapsing
in
august
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
those
innings
were
probably
helpful
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
well
i
think
is
complete
bs
what
happened
most
of
the
time
is
that
morris
fell
behind
and
the
team
came
back
and
rescued
him
mostly
this
is
because
hes
a
lousy
inning
pitcher
and
much
better
the
rest
of
the
way
that
the
team
can
climb
out
of
holes
consistently
and
win
them
is
not
to
morris
credit
its
to
the
teams
credit
furthermore
while
morris
did
exceed
the
wl
percentage
that
would
be
projected
from
his
runs
allowed
and
run
support
he
hasnt
done
this
in
previous
years
in
fact
his
wl
record
in
is
a
lot
worse
than
what
it
projects
to
be
with
run
support
and
runs
allowed
do
you
think
he
just
came
up
with
this
ability
in
look
at
the
postseason
games
he
pitched
decently
in
typical
morris
games
morris
gets
behind
team
rescues
him
hes
not
responsible
for
that
rescue
and
in
both
those
games
the
team
just
didnt
rescue
him
enough
jack
morris
pitched
as
well
as
he
did
during
much
of
the
season
in
those
games
the
offense
just
didnt
earn
him
a
victory
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrassing
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
his
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrassed
morris
is
one
of
those
guys
who
will
reture
when
he
cant
start
anymore
hes
too
bad
a
first
inning
pitcher

according

advanced

that
morris

and
slider
still
have
the

zip
and
that
his
problems
this

are
due
to
his
sudden
inability
to
keep
the

hidden
during
his

on
the

hand
still
have
my
doubts
morris
era
last
year
was
rather
high
for
a
pitcher
who
won
games
his
showing
in
the
series
was
not
surprising
although
im
not
convinced
that
hes
washed
up
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
whether
or
not

first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggests
more
baseball
to
watch
unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
i
definitely
do
thats
why
i
dont
like
going
to
see
games
played
on
artificial
turf
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by
managers
and
pitching
coaches
and
while
its
true
that
the
gaps
between
plays
can
be
interesting
this
is
only
true
when
they
dont
become
extralong
well
your
idea
of
interesting
differs
from
mine
i
think
batting
practice
is
interesting
for
example
and
make
a
special
effort
to
get
to
the
game
very
early
in
order
to
see
it
i
think
the
delaying
tactics
of
batters
pitchers
catchers
and
managers
are
interesting
because
theyre
attempts
to
gain
advantage
through
control
of
the
flow
and
timing
of
the
game
of
course
the
umpires
can
and
should
intervene
when
these
tactics
get
out
of
hand
as
ryan
robbins
has
pointed
out
there
are
rules
that
cover
this
one
of
the
more
fascinating
things
about
baseball
i
think
is
its
openendedness
with
regard
to
time
you
never
know
if
the
game
is
going
to
zip
right
by
and
be
over
in
less
than
two
hours
or
if
its
going
to
go
on
until
four
in
the
morning
likewise
some
games
are
actionpacked
and
some
games
are
slow
and
lazy
thats
fine
by
me
those
folks
who
want
constant
action
should
watch
the
games
on
tv
so
they
can
channel
surf
and
cater
to
their
short
attention

i

your

can

both

he
hits

precisely
why

rbis
this
is
the
situation
that
brought
the
question
up
the
red
sox
were
up
in
the
bottom
of
the
by
a
score
of
the
mariners
had
the
bases
loaded
with
out
the
batter
hits
a
fly
to
center
which
the
fielder
catches
the
runner
at
third
tags
and
scores
without
a
throw
now
without
a
judgement
call
and
i
dont
think
there
is
one
this
is
an
rbi
for
the
batter
it
seems
to
me
that
a
better
name
for
this
would
be
defensive
indifference
since
it
doesnt
really
matter
whether
the
guy
at
third
scores
at
that
point
i
know
i
can
think
of
several
if
the
mariners
stole
third
and
second
which
opening
the
base
would
allow
and
then
the
batter
hit
a
grounder
which
the
third
baseman
gets
deep
in
the
hole
between
himself
and
third
he
wouldnt
have
a
play
at
home
third
or
second
for
the
out
and
maybe
he
therefore
cant
make
the
throw
to
first
to
get
the
last
out
etc
scenarios
too
but
does
it
really
matter
if
this
guy
scores
this
way
when
youre
down
by
if
the
tying
run
is
going
to
score
so
is
the
guy
on
third
the
point
is
that
the
batter
imo
shouldnt
get
credit
an
rbi
for
utterly
failing
to
do
his
job
which
at
this
point
is
to
get
a
hit

an
injustice
to
the
giants
and
fans
of
the
giants
simple
reasons
batting
williams
ahead
of
bonds
will
create
a
leftclark
rightwilliams
leftbonds
situation
in
the
middle
of
the
batting
order
this
makes
it
tougher
for
opposing
manager
to
change
pitchers
having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams

thats

the
point
im

people
would

sympathetic
for

if
he

they
would
also
be
criticizing
him
a

more

how
about
jose

he
gets
a

what

hispanic

were

one
team
in

signed
lots
of
hispanics
because
they
went

better
with

did
and
why
would
more
hispanics
stick

dont

remember
this
is
the
country
that
had
special
racial

one

only

our

global
tensions
regarding
the

the
hispanic
minority
while
often

has
never
been
the
object

it
might
also
be
worth
your

subdivide

i
would

that
your

would
be
most
true
for

least
true

youd

that

clark
with

unlike
last

williams
is
getting
better
pitches
to
hit
with
bonds
looming
in
the
ondeck
circle
since
matt
has
a
terrible
batting
eye
this
helps
the
giants
a
lot
when
bonds
gets
on
base
all
by
himself
he
can
try
to
steal
and
then
be
driven
in
with
a
single
by
thompson
manwaring
or
clayton
if
you
bat
bonds
before
the
other
sluggers
then
you
dont
want
him
to
run
because
a
caught
stealing
could
take
you
out
of
a
big
inning
also
bonds
is
less
in
need
of
protection
behind
him
because
he
is
such
a
good
base
stealer
a
walk
is
a
potential
double
the
only
draw
back
is
when
clark
and
williams
are
clogging
up
the
bases
infront
of
bonds
and
i
think
thats
a
problem

lonnie

that

cfs
like
pettis
and
wilson
also
get
more

especially
if
they
actually
do

and
brock
wasnt

a

either
not
until

there
when

again
i

thatthe

is

if
you

there
seems
to
be

better

you

has
always

hit
five
times
in

led

in

five
times
but
we
can
count
him
if

itll

gary

he

milt

hes
not

hes

needs
a

snaps
the

for

otherwise
he
just
tries
to
get
people
out
as
for
clemens
in

of

believe
that
clemens
has
the
best
lifetime
record
for
his

as
compared
to
when
he
doesnt
pitch
how
bad
would
the
red

have
been
last

without
him
can
you
say
phillies
i
believe
clemens
is
the
better
pitcher
because
of
more
power
and
hsi
great
tenacity
morris
is

that
is
by
looking

the
point
is
that
the
only
decision
making

used
to
determine
the

is
the
score
of

it

the

there
is
no

inherent

of
comparing

that

how
it

after
all
baseball
is
a
team
game
and
you
know
what
there
is
no
such
method
inherent

real

i
would
assume
you
would
endorse
the
notion
that
we
cannot
state
with
any

of
objectivity
that
mother
theresa
has
accomplished
more
good
in
this

than
joseph
stalin
after
all
life
on

is
a
team
effort
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
base
ball
so
until
you
can
prove
that
clemens
contributes
to
a
ws
cham
pionship
more
than
morris
your
evaluation
of
clemens
is
totally
sub
jective
and
is
mere
opinion
i
have
yet
to

that
any

it

i
meant
that
if
having

him
gives
williams
possibly
unfounded
confidence
that
might
translate
into

youre
right
if
williams
biggest

more

i

to
catch
a

of

preventing
both

also

off

uncatchable
balls
turinging
doubles
into
singles
however
a
fielder
who
plays
shallow
will
catch
more
short
flies
and
fewer
long
flies
this
means
that
he
will
allow
fewer

more

as
i

he
was
an
infielder
when
he
was
drafted
a
as
he
came
up
through
the
braves
system
and
then
the
braves
put
him
through
position
changes
in
the
space
of
a
year
hes
an
adequate
of
although
not
great
and
at

some
of
your
perception
of
his

is
colored
by
watching
him
learn
to
play
the
of
at
the
ml
level
i
know
youre
another
longterm
braves
fan
about
playing
thats
the
most
difficult
position
to
field
after
catcher
at
ss
or
you
need
more
range
and
speed
but
at
youve
got
to
have
quick
reflexes
and
have
a
gun
for
an
arm
there
are
no
second
chances
at
even
when
playing
sandlot
softball
granted
id
still
put
my
best
overall
infielder
at
ss
but
thats
because
he
gets
more
chances
not
because
the
job
is
harder
it
still
amazes
me
that
so
many
teams
have
tried
to
convert
other
position
players
to
but
maybe
thats
because
the
supply
of
natural
is
scarce
finally
gant
is
a
player
who
puts
pressure
on
himself
to
perform
well
and
works
hard
to
improve
you
dont
get
those
amazingly
huge
arms
on
that
relatively
small
body
without
a
lot
of
weight
work
now
whether
hes
been
overdoing
it
these
days
may
be
a
valid
question
as
is
the
question
of
whether
he
tries
too
hard
to
make
something
happen
during
each
atbat
but
frankly
if
a
player
is
going
to
not
live
up
to
potential
id
much
rather
they
fail
by
trying
too
hard
than
by
not
trying
hard
enough
you
might
be
able

teach
relaxation

an
adult
but
at

age
i
dont

you
can

all

what
would
he
have

to
please
you

bat
you
can
hardly
claim
that
he

it
would

if
his

yes

today
lists
le
grand
chapeau
as
having
a
batting
average
and
a
obp
thats
on
hitting
with
zip
nil
nada
walks
the
reason
a
lot
of
us
are
down
on
galarraga
is
that
hes
has
a
long
history
of
showing
that
this
is
nowhere
near
his
real
level
of
ability
except
for
drawing
walks
if
he
hit
for
say
even
abs
id
be
convinced
that
there
was
a
real
change
in
his
ability
if
he
did
it
with
an
obpavg
id
not
only
be
amazed
but
id
make
a
bet
that
that
would
be
a
unique
feat
in
the

of
the

well
in

no
how
significant
is
galarragas
average
at
the

level
a
hit
is
worth
about
if
hed
had
one
of
those
hits
called
an
error
and
one
taken
away
by
a
good
defensive
play
hed
be
in
the
range
if
he
goes
in
his
next
game
hes
all
the
way
down
to
in
one
game
come
back
in
june
lets
talk
then
if
it
happens
that
the
pitchers
start
throwing
him
fewer
good
pitches
and
he
starts
making
lots
of
outs
as
someone
speculated
might
happen
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that
he
isnt
taking
enough
pitches
my
comment
that
he
isnt
paid
to
walk
doesnt
mean
that
he
should
have
a
license
to
swing
at
bad
pitches
and
make
outs
its
more
along
the
lines
of
hes
batting
and
leading
the
league
in
rbis
so
what
bloody
difference
does
it
make
if
he
isnt
drawing
a
lot
of
walks
sheesh
its
history
greg
andres
history
is
that
he
doesnt
walk
much
because
he
swings
at
bad
pitches
so
his
average
isnt
very
good
abs
doesnt
mean
an
awful
lot
compared
to
a
history
of
a
couple
of
thousand
especially
when
theres
ample
evidence
bb
in
that
his
basic
hitting
approach
hasnt
changed
yeah
he
might
suddenly
have
turned
into
a
hitter
who
never
walks

dont

to

on

when
the
guy
in

smooths
the

and
grab
the
trash
it
might

i
assumed
they
also
meant
there
was
no
such
thing
as
any
kind
of
clutch
performance
given
their
comments
im
still
licking
the
wounds
but
i
do
have
a
rebuttal
planned
gotta
do
my
homework
as
they
say
some
deletions
rather
they
showed
quite
convincingly
that
past
clutch
performance
has
never
been
able
to
predict
future
clutch
performance
im
sure
you
are
convinced
dave
apparently
so
is
tony
perez
i
however
am
not
i
believe
at
the
time
of
the
sabo
plate
appearance
that
juan
samuel
was
on
the
bench
available
for
pinchhit
duty
over
the
past
four
seasons
nonclutch
clutch
ab

ab

ba
sabo
samuel
i
do
not
claim
that
this
is
a
complete
statistical
analysis
that
proves
the
existence
of
clutch
hitting
or
compelling
testimony
that
samuel
would
have
gotten
a
base
hit
im
sure
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
sample
size
or
that
the
basic
assumption
that
clutch
performance
is
random
invalidates
any
conclusions
from
this
limited
application
or
something
or
other
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
statistical
analysis
well
we
agree
on
the
last
part
one
of
the
basic
things
you
need
to
have
in
a
statistic
to
be
able
to
predict
a
players
performance
on
it
in
the
future
is
for
there
to
be
a
correlation
from
year
to
year
a
players
batting
average
is
correlated
fairly
well
from
year
to
year
a
players
ability
to
walk
or
infielders
defensive
average
are
correlated
better
that
is
to
say
given
their
past
performance
in
those
statistics
we
can
have
a
pretty
good
handle
on
how
theyll
do
next
year
put
in
some
simple
information
about
aging
and
you
can
do
even
better
one
of
the
basic
problems
with
something
like
clutch
batting
average
overall
batting
average
is
that
the
correlation
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
adding
to
the
sample
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
as
a
counterexample
to
what
you
showed
consider
the
following
two
players
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
players
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situations
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
before
you
accuse
me
of
completely
cooking
the
data
there
were
players
who
had
clutch
at
bats
every
year
from
according
to
elias
as
a
simple
measure
of
clutchness
lets
just
look
at
clutch
banonclutch
ba
if
you
use
to
predict
for
those
players
youd
find
that
of
the
were
below
league
average
in
that
measure
both
in
and
in
were
above
league
average
in
both
periods
and
the
other
were
above
in
one
and
below
in
the
other
if
you
were
just
flipping
coins
youd
expect
to
get
abovebelow
in
both
and
that
switched
the
difference
between
the
observed
results
and
the
coin
flip
experiment
is
not
statisically
significant
btw
correlating
players
overall
batting
average
from
with
gives
a
correlation
coefficient
of
which
is
significant
at
something
better
than
the
confidence
level
correlating
their
clutchnonclutch
ba
for
the
same
period
gives
a
correlation
of
significant
at
no
level
of
any
interest
everyone
would
agree
i
hope
that
a
grand
slam
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
when
your
team
is
down
by
three
is
a
very
clutch
hit
there
is
just
no
way
to
predict
who
is
more
likely
to
get
the
clutch
hit
based
on
past
performance
hitting
in
clutch
situations
if
you

so
dave
no

actually
its
technically
incorrect

often
sounds
like

i
suspect
that
a
comment
like
i
enjoy
hitting
fourth
im
used
to
it
would
get
pretty
brutally
misinterpreted
by
the
media
if
it
came
from
strawberry
russ
porter
quoted
strawberry
as
saying
i
feel
more
comfortable
hitting
cleanup
and
i
think
i
perform
best
in
that
role
paraphrased
by
my
memory
and
bias
that
seems
like
a
fairly
nonpetulant
answer
to
what
was
almost
certainly
a
question
like
how
do
you
feel
about
being
moved
to
the
third
spot
in
the
order
a
more
mediasensitive
player
might
answer
the
manager
knows
what
he
is
doing
if
he
thinks
that
batting
me
third
will
help
the
team
then
i
am
all
for
it
wed
ignore
that
answer
as
brown
stuff
so
it
seems
a
little
bit
of
an
overreaction
to
brand
darryls
response
as
petulant
personally
i
think
his
argument
is
nonsense
and
that
it
really
doesnt
matter
much
in
which
order
the
players
in
the
order
are
batted
except
for
personal
stats
if
i
were
darryl
id
probably
answer
that
question
the
number
four
spot
gets
a
few
more
rbi
opportunities
and
i
get
paid
for
rbis
i
think
it
is
best
for
me
to
bat
fourth
but
i
am
willing
to
hit
third
if
tommy
thinks
it
will
benefit
the
team
or
something
like
that
it
would
be
helpful
at
salary
timemy
rbis
were
down
because
i
was
hitting
thirdand
make
him
sound
like
a
team
player
since
strawberry
will
not
likely
go
through
arbitration
but
use
the
free
agent
market
for
his
next
contract
maybe
that
argument
is
useless
but
it
would
help
his
image
with
the
media
without
appearing
to
be
totally
contentfree
remember
the
media
is
of
the
belief
that
ones
best
rbi
man
should
hit
fourth
so
the
argument
is
sensible
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
is
true

is

i
saw

several
times
too
no

about

daryl
missed

the

daryl
is
so
tall

he
had
the

shot
at

ball
daryls
just
whining
again
i
think
it
shows
a

when
tommy
daryl

the
dodgers
blame
a
single
fan
for
losing
the

what

threw
up

about

runs
up
to

point
sorry
tommy
if

feet
inches

maybe
just
maybe

ive
been
following
the

closely
over
the
offseason
newspapers

etc
but
i
had
my
first
up
close
and
personal
last
night
at
the
stick
after
watching
giants
hitters
struggle
last
year
barrys
swing
was
very
impressive
hes
very
quick
and
his
swing
seems
effortless
even
compared
to
clark
particularly
clark
as
of
late
it
was
interesting
to
see
bonds
hit
maddux
so
well
im
not
sure
if
barry
was
after
revenge
against
the
braves
or
what
but
he
stroked
three
very
pretty
hits
hr
for
rbis
the
giants
as
a
team
are
doing
a
lot
of
surprising
things
this
year
in
addition
to
bonds
there
has
been
some
good
pitching
and
some
hitters
seem
to
be
swinging
much
better
claytons
defense
has
been
superb
mcgee
seems
to
like
leading
off
this
year
manwaring
is
driving
the
ball
so
on
so
forth
i
hope
it
continuesi
think
they
need
to
continue
well
into
june
before
people
are
really
sold
that
they
are
for
realparticularly
the
pitching
for
myself
i
think
the
fresh
start
of
magowanbakeretc
has
really
wiped
out
a
lot
of
negatives
from
the
last
few
years
and
will
be

eight

so
buck
decides
to
let
the

try

get
his

complete

wickman
manages
to
get
two
outs
but
in
between
four
funs
score
and
all
of
a
sudden
its
and
wickman
just
cant
get
the
third
out
so
buck
goes
to
the

and
farr
gets
out
the
first
guy
he
faces
last
night
jimmy
key
is
pitching
another
in
a
long
string
of
games
of
his

this
guy
just
keeps
getting
better
through
eight
innings
yanks
lead
this
time
buck
thinks
i
dont
want
a
repeat
of
that
nearfiasco
with
wickman
so
ill
give
my
bullpen
some
work
steve
howe
whose
era
was
coming
into
the
game
left
with
it
at
he
didnt
do
too
good
then
farr
comes
in
he
gives
up
a
tworun
homer
and
the
royals
win
it
whats
going
on
this
is
already
the
third
or
fourth
time
this
year
that
the
bullpen
has
blown
a
lead
farr
howe
have
done
it
twice
together
monteleones
done
it
once
and
i
think
even
habyan
did
it
once
whats
the
deal
we
finally
have
terrific
starting
pitching
so
all
of
a

our
bullpen
turns

shit
whats

writes
one
last
infield
fly
question
that
has
always
puzzled
me
and
hasnt
yet
been
addressed
i
believe
the
rule
also
does
not
deal
with
this
situation
if
infield
fly
is
declared
and
the
ball
is
caught
runners
can
tag
up
and
advance
at
their
own
risk
as
on
any
fly
ball
however
if
the
infield
fly
is
not
caught
at
what
point
can
a
runner
legally
leave
his
base
wo
fear
of
being
doubled
off
for
advancing
too
early
when
the
ball
hits
the
ground
when
a
fielder
first
touches
the
ball
after
it
hits
the
ground
enlightenment
would
be
appreciated
im
not
sure
i
understand
this
question
when
the
if
rule
is
invoked
the
batter
is
automatically
out
this
relieves
the
runners
from
being
forced
to
advance
to
the
next
base
if
the
ball
is
not
caught
other
than
that
isnt
it
just
the
same
as
any
situation
in
which
a
runner
on
a
base
is
not
forced
to
the
next
base
on
a
dropped
fly
ball
that
is
if
the
ball
is
caught
he
can
tag
up
and
run
or
decide
to
stay
and
if
the
ball
is
dropped
he
can
have
left
the
base
at
any
time

in

pretty
short

i
understand
boever
and
murphy
were

the

houston
felt
that
their

a

art
doug

is
the
key
to
houstons
success
he
must
have
another
great

for
houston
to

in

west
no
argument
at
all
with
murphy
he
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
when
he
came
in
last
year
on
the
other
hand
the
club
though
enough
of
boever
to
put
him
into
an
awful
lot
of
games
he
may
have
led
the
league
in
appearances
he
did
at
least
at
some
point
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
viable
setup
guy
but
i
guess
thats
not
considered
that
crucial
by
the
club
i
can
just
remember
two
years
ago
so
well
though
the
unsuspected
strength
of
the
lower
part
of
the
order
has
saved
the
club
so
far
biggio
and
finley
just
arent
doing
their
job
of
getting
on
base
instead
of
filling
his
role
as
an
rbi
man
bagwell
has
had
to
assume
biggio
and
finleys
job
biggio
concerns
me
since
he
usually
starts
the
season
very
strong
im
not
that
concerned
those
guys
have
been
relatively
consistent
over
the
years
and
they
have
no
good
reasons
to
decline
no
injuries
not
old
i
expect
them
to
come
through
just
fine
its
those
guys
that
have
not
been
consistently
good
that
are
the
worrisome
part
even
if
they
are
coming
through
right
now
on
a
side
note
are
you
at
all
concerned
with
the
rumors
concerning
next
years
uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
traditional
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniforms
may
totally
eliminate
the
color
orange
shiver
mclanes
favorite
color
is
red
so
this
sounds
like
their
old
road
unis
pretty
dull
buttons
or
pullovers
ill
check
through
my
uniform
book
to
see
if
theyve
always
had
some
orange
im
really
upset
the
current
unforms
are
dull
and
the
new
ones
sound
horrible
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretty
but
houston
had
established
a
long
precident
of
wearing
the
ugliest
uniforms
in
baseball
and
i
liked
it
well
well
see
ive
got
a
astros
pullover
shirt
with
the
astros
stripes
across
the
shoulders
and
i
have
trouble
making
myself
wear
it
in
public
i
can
see
why
they
might
want
that
to
change
gee
if
they
eliminate
the
orange
will
they
reupholster
the
seats
in
the
astros
stripes
section
what
used
to
be
the
gold
and
yellow
levels
i
dont
know
those
numbers
they
use
now
i
saw
a
pinstripe

actually
thought

the

horner
had

season
ticket
holder

never
really
complained

sure
its
been

lines
were
long

so
i
thought
i
went

tuesdays
game
giants
over
the
marlins
and
the
stick
was
a
much
different
place
nothing
short

everything
is
a

better
the
lines
are
a

shorter
the

are
clean

have
running
water
and
the
hired

were
very
polite
the

foghorn
lights
up
and
blows
after
each
homerun
and
the

are
very

are

looks
electronic
could

these

doesnt

like

an
item
in

the
austin

if
you
read
it
here
it
was
somewhere
else
first
said
that
he
wouldnt
take
injuries
as
an

that
possibility
should
have
been
accounted

uh
oh
i
dont

an
owner
thatll
keep
everybody
on
edge
id
never
gotten
that
feeling
about
him
but
who
knows
does
to
be
honest
i
think
the
city
of
houston
loves
the
new
owner
he
has
brought
baseball
back
to
houston
with
key
acquisitions
players
that
were
from
the
houston
area
and
wanted
to
play
for
the
astros
i
dont
think
that
too
many
people
are
fearful
that
mclane
will
meddle
in
the
team
as
he
has
already
admitted
that
he
doesnt
know
a
whole
lot
about
baseball
mclane
is
a
businessman
and
doesnt
like
excuses
he
makes
a
valid
point
that
injuries
shouldnt
be
an
excuse
to
this
club
look
at
the
depth
of
the
bench
this
season
canadele
can
play
positions
bass
and
james
are
solid
outfielders
and
can
hit
well
too
uribe
is
nice
to
have
as
well
the
pitching
staff
has
legitimate
starters
were
dealing
with
a
young
houston
team
so
injuries
shouldnt
play
a
big
role
the
only
threat
is
the
bullpen
if
jonesy
goes
out
we
may
be
in
trouble
but
with
the
type
of
starters
we
have
this
season
there
is
less
pressure

that
just

big
deal
not
smith
has
hung
around
for
a
long
time
and
fielded
the
position
better
than
anyone
else
ever
has
yount
stopped
being
a
shortstop
about
a
decade
ago
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
one
of
his
two
mvp
awards
was
as
a
centerfielder
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
like
whom
there
are
many
players
in
the
hall
who
arent
anywhere
near
as
goos
as
the
guys
youre
running
down
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
thats
already
the
case
by
some
standards
but
the
bad
players
in
the
hall
are
all
from
the
and
recent
picks
have
generally
been
excellent
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
no
but
who
cares
was
stan
musial
anywhere
near
as
good
as
babe
ruth
not
really
but
he
obviously
belongs
there
the
hall
has
generally
had
about
the
top
of
major
leaguers
as
more
players
come
through
the
game
more
will
be
in
that
top
and
yes
its
pretty
easy
to
argue
that
smith
yount
evans
winfield
etc
are
in
the
top
dave
kingman
on
the
other
hand
was
a
liability
throughout
most
of
his
career
of
course
garvey
hasnt
gotten
a
lot
of
hof
press
so
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
as
for
ryan
is
his
wl
better
than
morris
thats
what
a
lot
of
voters
tend
to
look
at
and
morris
was
awfully
good
for
a
decade
and
doesnt
lead
mlb
history
in
walks

yuck
he
undulated
his

flew
up

down
keeping
time
with
his
rolling

of
stomachs
which
flew
all
around
the
cozy

he
oozed

made

major

baseball
is
trying
to
expand
its
appeal
to
people
with
shorter
attention
spans
ie
the
football
crowd
invariably
all
the
arguments
from
people
who
dont
like
to
watch
baseball
on
tv
say
the
same
thing
the
games
are
too
long
and
too
boring
baseball
is
trying
to
find
a
way
to
shorten
the
games
for
wider
tv
appeal
if
you
look
at
it
though
baseball
games
last
around
the
same
amount
of
time
as
football
games
the
difference
is
that
there
is
more
action
in
that
duration
in
football
games
perhaps
if
there
were
more
action
in
baseball
games
you
would
get
more
of
those
fans
to
tune
in
anyway
coming
up
with
a
solution
to
make
baseball
more
appealing
to
a
bigger
crowd
is
going
to
be
difficult
on
soapbox
yet
another
reason
to
get
a
commisioner
now
since
its
obvious
that
ruling
baseball
by
comittee
works
about
as
fast
as
a
snail
race
in
nebraska
off
soapbox
how
can
you
say
there
is
more
action
in
football
then
baseball
a
football
game
consists
of
approximately
plays
and
the
average
duration
of
a
play
is
around
seconds
this
means
that
in
a
game
that
lasts
approximately
hours
you
have
about
minute
s
of
action
in
a
baseball
game
you
have
upwards
of
two
hundred
pitches
there
are
very
few
on
field
strategy
on
field
stratgy
sessions
ie
huddles
and
you
always
have
a
chance
to
win
until
the
last
out
is
made
ah
but
the
illusion
in
football
is
that
there
is
always
lots
of
action
and
a
sense
of
urgency
because
of
the
game
clock
not
all
the
time
but
it
happens
when
theres
less
than
minutes
to
go
quite
often
this
sense
creates
drama
even
when
there
may
not
necessarily
be
any
and
that
holds
a
viewers
attention
in
baseball
only
players
are
involved
in
the
action
for
about
here
comes
a
wild
guess
of
the
time
and
theyre
just
playing
a
sophisticated
game
of
catchholdtheballstepoutoftheboxadjustchains

theres
a

its
real

to
get
so
focussed

and
forget
that
the

happen

if

you

some

like

i
prefer
to
watch

win
when
the

slip
to

then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus

whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it

does

clark
is
the
best
first
baseman
in

majors
and
that
matt
williams
is
a
better
power
hitter
than
any
other
ballplayer
in

i
dont
follow
al
so
i
wont
comment
on
majors
in
the
nl
if
i
had
my
choice
of
any
in
the
league
for
my
team
itd
be
clark
and
id
hit
him
third
my
fantasy
team
has
both
grace
and
murray
on
it
because
ive
never
been
able
to
get
clark
id
take
any
of
the
three
without
hesitation
in
real
life
but
i
think
clark
is
it
williams
not
even
close
i
much
prefer
his
defense
but
when
he
isnt
headcasing
it
matt
has
a
good
solid
swing
and
some
real
punch
if
he
drops
to
then
he
wanders
out
of
cleanup
but
according
to
the
latest
baseball
weekly
hes
hitting
and
in
the
last
week
hitting
thats
not
exactly
chopped
liver
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that

its
rather
silly

why

you

getting

hit

helping
their

as
getting
the

the
best
example
i

is
jerry

minnesota
all
he
had
to
do
was
put

only
more
often
when
they
needed
to
a
difference
way
too
small
to
be
the
result
of

skill
essentially
the
players
who
hit

seem
to
do
so
because
they
hit

often

without

conclusive

some

he

the
best

this
move
has
enabled
him
to
pitch
out
of
some
tight
early
jams
and
has
certainly
contributed
to
his

watch

we

the

that
its

this
is
a

strategy
if

though
the

are

frankly
as

this

it

from

hes

neither

howard

unless
they

they
can

this

which
seems
possible
and
need
boggs
to

i
think
theyre
making
the
same
sort
of
mistake
with
davis
that
boston
made
with
boggs
leaving
him
in
the
minors
for
two

three
years

ab
through

theyve
just
never
figured
out
what
to
do
with
him
i
suspect
that
he
hits
enough
especially
vs
lefties
to
be
a
reasonable
shortstop
one
rumor
running
around
during
spring
training
was
that
they
wanted
to
convert
silvestri
to
be
a
catcher
because
his
body
type
was
wrong
for
a
shortstop
youd
think

mattingly

before
you
start
up
yes
i
have
proof
there
are
really
only
two
adequate
ways
to
measure
fielding
prowess
the
first
which
has
the
advantage
of
being
applicable
to
older
players
since
it
uses
raw
data
available
for
almost
all
of
mlb
history
is
the
total
chances
per
game
method
favored
by
the
total
baseball
people
among
others
it
basically
says
that
you
measure
a
fielder
by
how
many
balls
he
gets
to
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
it
thus
favors
first
basemen
who
play
deep
reaching
a
lot
of
balls
but
forcing
the
pitcher
to
cover
first
more
frequently
it
also
hurts
first
baseman
who
play
behind
lefthanded
pitching
staffs
and
thus
face
few
lefthanded
batters
a
better
method
but
newer
and
based
ondata
that
has
only
been
collected
over
the
last
few
years
measures
the
percentage
of
balls
hit
into
the
part
of
the
field
the
guy
is
responsible
for
this
is
better
of
course
it
still
isnt

a
little
wildnessthe
reds
managed
to
overcome
their
trademark
lack
of
timely
hitting
in
crucial
situations
during
spring
training
i
made
a
similarly
innoncentlooking
comment
about
clutch
hitting
on
this
bb
and
the
flames
were
flying
no
such
thing
as
clutch
hitting
they
the
sdcns
all
screamed
i
assumed
they
also
meant
there
was
no
such
thing
as
any
kind
of
clutch
performance
given
their
comments
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
there
is
no
significant
ability
toi
perform
in
the
clutch
but
clutch
performance
certainly
happens
every
time
there
is
a
gamewinning
hit
the
clutch
pitching
quoted
above
is
something
which
happened
not
a
claim
that
any
particular
player
should
be
expected
to
be
a
clutch
pitcher
over
the
past
four
seasons
sabo
has
had
hits
in
abs
defined
as
clutch
situations
by
the
scouting
report
for
an
average
of
over
that
same
period
he
had
another
abs
with
hits
for
an
average
of
according
to
the
rest
of
the
sdcns
any
differential
such
as
this
is
completely
and
totally
random
and
cannot
be
used
for
any
reasonable
inference
such
as
perhaps
perez
should
have
used
a
pinch
hitter
in
that
situation
simple
statistics
tell
me
that
there
is
a
chance
an
average
clutch
hitter
would
have
this
large
a
split
the
average
decrease
is
points
standard
deviation
about
there
will
be
such
hitters
in
any
league
just
as
there
will
be
hitters
who
hit
poorly
on
tuesdays
and
there
is
only
a
very
weak
correlation
in
my
best
study
between
clutch
hitting
in
the
last
four
years
and
clutch
hitting
this
year
probably
because
most
of
the
clutch
data
is
determinaed
by
luck
rather
than
any
ability
based
only
on
this
data
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
pinchhit
for
sabo
or
any
other
player
who
had
been
a
poor
clutch
hitter
in
the
past
but
there
are
many
other
factors
involved
in
a
decision
to
pinchhit
does
the
pinchhitter
give
you
a
platoon
advantage
any
portion
of
sabos
clutch
split
that
results
from
his
platoon
split
is
certainly
a
real
ability
even
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
clutch
hitting
do
you
have
a
singles
hitter
at
the
plate
when
you
need
a
home
run
do
you
have
a
curveball
pitcher
facing
a
batter
who
has
trouble
with
curves

ideally
dhs
should
be
the
strongest
offensive
players
because
any
schmoe
can
play
dh
if
he
can
hit
that
would
take
care
of
position
corrected
anomolies
such
as
franks
since
that
is
not
the
case
and
why
not
is
it
always
this
way
then
we
are
going
to
have
trouble
finding
the
true
value
of
dhs
using
the
same
models
as
that
for
position
players
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
difference
the
main
reason
is
that
good
hitters
in
their
prime
such
as
frank
thomas
and
danny
tartabull
are
rarely
regular
dhs
even
if
they
cant
field
its
more
commonly
a
place
to
put
aging
veterans
another
use
of
the
dh
slot
is
to
help
a
player
come
back
from
injury
slowly
getting
his
bat
in
the
lineup
without
forcing
him
to
play
in
the
field
i
would
expect
such
players
to
hit
worse
as
dhs
than
they
did
during
the
rest
of
the
season
a
third
factor
is
that
most
player
who
split
time
between
dh
and
first
or
the
outfield
dont
hit
as
well
as
dhs
for
some
reason
reggie
jackson
was
a
good
example
in
five
years
as
a
rfdh
for
the
angels
he
hit
like
the
old
reggie
when
he
was
in
right
the
second
and
third
factors
will
be
lost
if
players
are
considered
by
their
primary
position
only
a
player
who
plays
games
in
right
and
at
dh
will
count
only
in
the
right
fielders
averages
a
logical
starting
place
would
be
to
look
at
defensive
replacement
value
if
you
can
find
it
for
or
lf
or
something
we
can
assume
that
if
forced
to
play
defense
they
would
play
at
true
zero
value
even
though
i
doubt
this
is
actually
true
for
players
like
winfield
and
molitor
this
would
let
us
discount
the
time
they
spend
playing
dh
because
that
forces
the
team
to
find
another
real
fielder
to
play
this
makes
sense
you
might
also
look
at
it
another
way
although
the
average
offensive
performance
of
a
dh
may
be
lower
than
for
a
left
fielder
the
replacementlevel
offensive
performance
is
certainly
lower
if
you
are
a
left
fielder
but
cant
hit
well
enough
to
keep
a
job
anywhere
then
you
certainly
cant
hit
well
enough
to
keep
a
job

here
we

actually
several
scdns
stated

that
would

more
likely
to
perform
better
in

however
one
might

can
you

i
used
the
smaller

and
elsewhere
on
this
thread
sherri

repeats
her
position
that
batting

in

is
a
meaningless
statistic
for
predicting

it
has
been
entirely

at

if
it
has

we
dont
know
how
to
find
it
i
did
not

i

samuel
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
ill
try
to
avoid
being
insulting
but
its
difficult
when
you
so
cavalierly
dismiss
hundreds
of
hours
of
work
with
an
i
dont
pretend
to
understand
but
nobody
is
denying
that
there
are
people
who
have
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
past
but
i
challenge
you
to
find
a
method
to
predict
who
will
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
the
future
which
after
all
is
what
you
are
claiming
you
can
do
since
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict
the
future
i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
fine
we
have
plenty
of
data
obviously
our
preconceived
biases
must
be
coloring
our
work
since
you
know
clutch
hitting
is
a
welldefined
and
consistent
skill
all
of
our
failures
notwithstanding
so
i
challenge
you
to
prove
it
i
guarantee
you
that
if
you
can
prove
the
existance
of
some
form
of
clutch
ability
you
will
have
plenty
of
happy
sdcns
dancing
around
you
i
did
not

i
said

i
did

it

i
have
said
that
it
is
an

of

under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
but
you
arent
going
to
win
any
support
by
merely
stating
a
position
and
claiming
they
are
stupid
so
i
must
be
right
and
big
sigh
i
have
not

not
not
ever
called

it
is
nice
however
to

the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived

yeah
hindsight

always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could

and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
a
suggestion
take
data
from
and
attempt
to
come
up
with
some
method
that
predicts
who
hit
well
in
the
clutch
in
if
that
works
we
can
then
attempt
to
apply
it
to
and
beyond
wait
a
minute
i
thought
i
first
had
to
define
clutch
hitting
do
i
or
dont
i
you
have
made
strong
statements
now
back
them
up
or
be
proven
a
total
idiot
i
made
two
statements
in
my
post
i
am
not
convinced
of
your
conclusions
regarding
clutch
hitting
i
would
have
hit
for
sabo
as
for
many
of
us
make
a
number
of
written
statements
through
this
media
about
what
we
think
will
happen
in
baseball
im
not
shy
about
it
ill
make
the
statement
again
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
so
what
could
we
expect
in
from
mr
carter
well
his
composite
ba
through
was
through
was
through
was
so
i
think
we
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
kind
of
batting
average
he
can
produce
in
he
hit
not
surprising
huh
also
in
nonclutch
ab
h
clutch
ab
h
no
this
doesnt
prove
any
overall
statistical
trend
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
across
the
breadth
of
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
as
for
above
i
have
plenty

company

dewan

bill

in

with

a
after
striking
out
on
a
bad
inside
pitch
apparently
johnson
made
an
ok
ive
got
to
stay
focused
gesture
which
iron
mike
interpreted
as
taunting
and
struck
out
to
heavy
booing
the
next
two
times
as
valentine
noted
last
night
he
came
up
in
the
first
after
riles

quintana

can
you

take
the

dribbled

hit

straight

he

suppsoed

i
couldnt
tell
from

angle

his

looked
bad

coughed
a

leadoff

a

said
he
sure
dont

there
is
a
theory

a

bosios
nohitter
i
watched
the
final
inning
of
bosios
nohitter
with
several
people
at
work
after
vizquel
made
that
barehanded
grab
of
the
chopper
up
the
middle
someone
remarked
that
if
he
had
fielded
it
with
his
glove
he
wouldnt
have
had
time
to
throw
riles
out
yet
the
throw
beat
riles
by
about
two
steps
i
wonder
how
many
others
who
watched
the
final
out
think
vizquel
had
no
choice
but
to
make
the
play
with
his
bare
hand
does
anybody
think
vizquel
was
wrong
to
field
the
ball
barehanded
and
if
he
failed
to
field
it
cleanly
would
it
or
should
it
have
been
an
error
or
a
hit
judging
from
bosios
grimace
when
the
ball
bounced
past
him
he
must
have
thought
it
would
go
through
for
a
hit
whether
vizquel
was
right
or
wrong
he
certainly
made
one
hell

a
play

re

for

in
article
writes
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
but
ingnoring
putouts
is
biased
in
yet
another
way
range
is
not
the
only
thing
that
makes
a
good
firstbaseman
the
ability
to
field
all
sorts
of
balls
thrown
to
him
digging
some
out
of
the
dirt
stretching
for
others
and
so
forth
is
important
thus
putouts
do
provide
some
information
maybe
what
we
need
is
a
comparision
of
how
many
balls
were
thrown
to
the
area
of
the
first
baseman
vs
how
many
he
actually

oh

a

one
over

in

one

i
listened

listening

was
a

as

i

i

if

the

that

ive
been

almost
years
now
i
say
that
just
tp
preface
what
im
about
to
post
this
braves
team
is
made
up
of
slow
starters
people
are
amazed
that
the
braves
arent
hitting
dont
be
they
werent
hitting
last
year
at
this
time
nor
were
they
the
year
before
they
had
slow
aprils
and
mays
in
the
and
seasons
and
yet
they
still
managed
to
go
to
the
series
in
those
years
well
this
team
is
no
different
so
why
should
we
be
suprised
at
their
slow
start
they
started
that
way
for
the
past
two
years
and
theyll
be
that
way
until
the
richmond
club
makes
it
to
the
majors
judge
their
offense
in
june
or
july
when
things
start
to
average
out
im
just
happy
that
the
reds
have
gotten
off
to
such
a
poor
start
the
giants
always
do
well
in
the
early
part
of
the
season
but
theyll
be
out
of
the
race
by
july
just
like
the
last
few

developes

devoid

one
of
the
basic
things
you
need
to
have
in

statistic
to
be
able

predict
a

performance
on
it

is
for
there
to
be
a
correlation
from

a
players
batting

is
correlated
fairly
well
from
year
to
year
ok
the
basic
problems
with
something
like
clutch
batting
average
overall
batting

is
that
the
correlation
from
year
to
year
is
almost
zero
adding
to
the
sample
size
doesnt
seem
to
help
much
actually
i
think
the
largescale
sample
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
as
a
counterexample
to
what
you
showed
consider
the
following
two
players
from
nonclutch
clutch
ab
h
ba
ab
h
ba
maldonado
lemon
if
you
had
had
these
two
players
in
by
your
logic
in
those
clutch
situations
youd
bat
maldonado
for
lemon
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
well
in
maldonado
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
while
lemon
hit
in
nonclutch
and
in
clutch
before
you
accuse
me
of
completely
cooking
the
data
you
wont
hear
those
kind
of
accusations
from
me
it
is
interesting
that
you
selected
maldonado
because
he
is
someone
whom
i
have
also
looked
at
he
has
been
a
very
inconsistent
hitter
in
terms
of
ba
hitting
in
admittedly
he
has
been
traded
between
leagues
as
well
as
clubs
his
clutch
hitting
record
is
equally
inconsistent
so
for
my
purposes
in
i
would
not
draw
any
conclusions
about
his
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
based
on
his
prior
performance
i
dont
know
how
i
would
have
felt
in
but
you
may
indeed
be
right
when
i
looked
at
sabo
i
found
a
more
consistent
record
of
hitting
and
a
more
consistent
pattern
of
his
clutch
hitting
being
proportionately
below
his
nonclutch
ba
ditto
for
joe
carter
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
btw
correlating
players
overall
batting
average
from
with
gives
a
correlation
coefficient
of
which
is
significant
at
something
better
than
the
confidence
level
correlating
their
clutchnonclutch
ba
for
the
same
period
gives
a
correlation
of
significant
at
no
level
of
any
interest
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
actually
its
technically
incorrect
to
say
that
we
cant
predict
future
clutch
performance
its
more
correct
to

correct
right
i
would
have
used
aspects
of
prior
performance
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consistent
in
the
past
overall
performance
lr
splits
even
matching
hittingpitching
styles
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantage
if
used
properly
even
if
all
else
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at
past
clutch
performance
and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
one
more
time
i
did
not
claim
to
be
able
to
predict
the
future
i
said
that
i
accept
the
above
data
as
an
indication
that
samuel
would
have
had
a
better
chance
for
success
in
that
situation
than
sabo
that
comes
down
to
the
same
thing
when
perez
left
sabo
in
he
was
predicting
the
future
the
next
ab
he
was
predicting
that
sabo
was
more
likely
to
get
a
hit
than
samuel
by
supporting
the
swap
you
are
predicting
the
opposite
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your
work
im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your
work
well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
right
this
is
the
beef
it
has
not
proven
to
be
an
indicator
of
future
performance
under
any
circumstances
at
least
none
that
weve
been
able
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indicator
of
future
performance
please
let
us
in
on
your
secret
it
is
nice
however
to
see
that
you
will
consider
the
possibility
that
you
actually
could
have
some
preconceived
biases
most
certainly
as
i
have
repeatedly
stated
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
study
which
even
hints
at
a
consistent
clutch
ability
i
would
love
it
however
the
straightforward
attempts
at
such
a
study
have
all
failed
miserably
yeah
hindsight
is
always
doesnt
that
make
you
bright
this
is
a
stupid
argument
and
you
know
it
ah
i
knew
we
could
get
to
the
name
calling
and
theres
that
word
you
like
so
much
well
it
was
a
stupid
argument
are
you
honestly
debating
that
sure
we
know
sabo
didnt
get
a
hit
we
have
no
idea
whether
samuel
would
have
done
any
better
or
not
one
ab
most
certainly
doesnt
prove
anything
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work
last
year
or
the
year
before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
no
this
doesnt
prove
any
overall
statistical
trend
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
performance
across
the
breadth
of
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you

us

reason
to
expect

ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the

thats

i
agree
with
the
flavor
of
this
post
but
disagree
with
one
specific
argument
that
has
great
hands
means
nothing
it
seems
to
me
that
a
firstbasemans
defensive
value
is
not
entirely
or
even
primarily
from
his
ability
to
field
grounders
or
catch
popups
how
many
such
chances
does
he
get
during
a
game
many
fewer
than
he
gets
chances
to
catch
throws
from
and
p
i
mean
the
total
of
these
is
much
higher
than
grounderpopup
totals
this
implies
to
me
that
there
is
value
in
catching
these
throws
well
even
if
they
are
high
uptheline
or
in
the
dirt
good
hands
are
needed
for
such
plays
and
thus
have
value
i
dont
have
any
numbers
for
the
relative
number
of
occurences
of
these
plays
but
id
guess
that
the
values
of
these
abilities
are
similar
its
just
like
you
dont
judge
catchers
defense
primarily
on
how
they
field
bunts
and
popups
but
not
as
marked
i
suppose

the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
right
most
definitely
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
this
may
be
the
root
of
the
confusion
please
consider
the
following
hypothetical
with
an
open
mind
note
that
i
am
not
yet
saying
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
at
hand
suppose
we
have
a
simplified
lotto
game
you
pick
a
number
from
and
win
if
that
number
is
drawn
suppose
we
have
a
large
population
of
people
who
play
this
game
every
week
in
the
first
year
of
the
game
approximately
of
the
population
will
win
or
more
times
in
the
second
year
of
the
game
of
those
winners
will
again
be
winners
in
the
third
year
of
the
game
of
those
who
won
or
more
times
in
each
of
the
first
two
years
will
win
again
suppose
i
started
with
people
in
my
population
after
three
years
i
have
people
who
have
consistently
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
won
or
more
the
number
of
times
expected
do
we
expect
them
to
be
big
winners
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
game
no
because
we
know
there
is
no
skill
involved
nothing
about
these
consistent
winners
can
influence
their
chances
of
winning
but
suppose
we
dont
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
chance
that
skill
might
be
involved
perhaps
some
of
the
people
in
our
population
are
psychic
or
something
how
would
we
test
this
hypothesis
we
can
look
for
correlations
in
the
population
now
most
of
the
population
will
show
zero
correlation
but
our
psychics
should
show
a
high
positive
correlation
even
if
they
arent
very
good
psychics
they
should
still
manage
to
win
or
more
times
most
years
net
result
a
small
positive
correlation
over
the
entire
population
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
well
zero
correlation
is
zero
correlation
you
mention
that
sabo
has
hit
poorly
in
the
clutch
over
the
last
years
but
if
we
look
at
the
past
we
find
that
clutch
patterns
are
just
as
likely
to
reverse
as
they
are
to
remain
consistent
the
length
of
the
streak
doesnt
seem
to
make
a
difference
to
the
probability
that
the
player
will
be
clutch
or
choke
the
next
year
is
there
any
reason
to
expect
this
streak
to
be
different
from
past
streaks
now
if
it
were
true
that
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remained
true
to
form
then
we
might
have
something
useful
but
then
we
wouldnt
have
zero
correlation
instead
we
have
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remain
true
to
form
and
of
all
threeyear
streaks
reverse
you
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
choke
this
year
but
it
would
be
equally
valid
to
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
be
clutch
this
year
since
the
probabilities
are
split
each
way
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
then
we
would
have
something
useful
and
we
would
also
have
a
positive
correlation
but
for
every
individual
that
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
holds
true
there
is
another
who
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
then
reverses

note
im
not
posting
this
as
part

with

but
as
an
independent
sort
of

i
do
actually
quote
some
things
that

but
it
might
be
better
to
think
of
this
as
sampling
his

in
the
hiphop
sense
because
it
fits
in
with
what
i
want
to
say
maynardramseycslaurentianca
roger
maynard
writes
but
the
point
is
that
the
only
decision
making
pro
cess
used
to
determine
the
best
is
the
score
of
the
game
and
it
re
lates
to
the
teams
not
the
individual
players
there
is
no
method
inherent
in
baseball
of
comparing
individual
performances
and
that
is
how
it
should
be
because
after
all
baseball
is
a
team
game
theres
an
interesting
parallel
between
this
way
of
viewing
a
baseball
team
and
some
peoples
conception
of
a
biological
organism
in
the
biology
context
we
would
very
likely
read
fitness
for
the
score
of
the
game
and
organisms
for
teams
how
we
interpret
players
is
trickier
but
either
organs
or
genes
might
seem
reasonable
choices
depending
on
what
point
we
were
trying
to
make
a
genes
interpretation
actually
might
be
really
interesting
in
this
case
but
that
would
be
a
different
and
probably
longer
post
if
however
we
take
the
organ
view
then
our
knowledge
of
biology
should
make
us
pause
before
we
start
saying
things
like
species
x
is
more
fit
than
species
y
because
of
a
better
organ
z
given
what
we
know
about
the
interdependence
of
organs
we
would
often
be
suspicious
of
such
claims
but
note
that
this
type
of
argument
is
quite
often
made
when
you
map
species
x
onto
humans
and
organ
z
onto
brain
on
the
other
hand
some
statements
of
this
kind
do
seem
more
reasonable
than
others
as
far
as
we
can
test
them
eg
brain
above
might
be
more
reasonable
than
pancreas
assuming
no
gross
pathology
particularly
if
species
y
is
a
primate
even
when
you
make
such
statements
you
should
be
concerned
with
the
functioning
of
the
whole
organism
and
the
possibility
that
one
organ
might
be
more
crucial
for
one
species
and
a
second
organ
in
another
not
to
mention
the
possibility
that
no
organ
is
particularly
crucial
in
some
third
species
however
if
we
are
nonvitalists
with
any
kind
of
reductionsit
streak
we
will
want
to
say
that
an
organism
is
not
some
completely
magical
unanalyzable
whole
but
an
intriguing
process
made
up
of
various
subprocesses
that
interact
in
ways
that
are
potentially
observable
some
of
these
processes
might
be
localized
to
particular
organs
while
others
may
be
distributed
across
multiple
organs
in
a
way
this
is
just
like
a
baseball
team
except
that
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
that
the
processes
and
interactions
involved
in
baseball
are
much
simpler
and
less
numerous
than
in
most
organisms
to
say
that
one
player
is
better
than
another
is
to
be
able
to
say
ab
solutely
that
player
as
team
would
have
played
better
with
player
b
in
their
lineup
sheer
speculation
impossible
to
ascertain
one
thing
that
is
quite
difficult
about
baseball
is
that
perfectly
controlled
experiments
are
sometimes
very
tough
to
do
but
of
course
this
has
never
stopped
researchers
from
doing
the
best
they
can
and
sometimes
deriving
very
powerful
conclusions
even
in
the
absence
of
certainty
most
of
this
goes
far
beyond
sheer
speculation
but
even
sheer
speculation
can
motivate
further
interesting
research
if
you
want
to
select
a
group
of
statistics
and
claim
that
clemens
has
done
better
than
another
pitcher
with
those
statistics
as
a
criteria
then
fine
in
this
cases
were
seeing
the
word
statistics
means
summary
of
observed
events
where
the
events
themselves
can
be
viewed
as
the
output
of
some
process
and
possibly
inputs
for
other
processes
thus
if
we
have
any
valid
notion
of
how
the
processes
are
put
together
into
the
functioning
organism
data
in
the
form
of
statistics
might
give
us
a
basis
to
test
particular
hypotheses
but
you
have
to
be
able
to
prove
that
those
statistics
measure
the
individuals
contribution
to
winning
the
ws
because
that
is
the
only
measure
of
best
that
has
any
meaning
in
the
context
of
baseball
this
statement
brings
us
back
to
the
concept
of
fitness
again
fitness
is
defined
in
terms
of
both
an
organism
and
its
environment
you
might
be
fit
in
one
situation
and
not
another
moving
to
baseball
it
is
clear
that
each
team
spends
the
entire
season
in
an
environment
including
all
the
other
teams
in
the
league
in
at
least
a
nominal
sense
the
division
winners
are
the
fittest
teams
in
the
league
in
that
they
on
average
had
better
fitness
scores
than
any
of
their
competing
opponennts
but
in
a
real
sense
there
is
a
fairly
large
random
component
in
the
performance
of
each
team
that
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
account
for
in
terms
of
factors
intrinsic
to
or
interesting
for
baseball
the
same
is
true
in
biology
but
here
is
also
no
direct
biological
equivalent
of
the
world
series
in
basebal
in
the
world
series
the
random
component
may
be
greatly
magnified
by
the
small
number
of
games
that
are
played
and
both
teams
suddenly
experience
huge
changes
from
the
environement
where
they
were
originally
successful
it
might
be
fun
to
watch
but
its
unclear
what
it
all
really
means
now
just
one
more
unrelated
point
i
have
yet
to
see
that
any
of
you
can
predict
a
ws
winner
with
any
greater
accuracy
than
jeanne
dixon
on
the
other
hand
you
have
seen
some
of
us
who
can
predict
the
outcome
of
the
divisional
races
better
than
a
random
assignment
of
teams
to
finishes
and
maybe
some
of
us
eg
me
who
can
do
this
better
than
the
other
participants
in
this
forum
on
a
regular
basis
but
this
is
probably
only
due
to
the
fact
that
a
schedule
gives
you
a
little
hope
that
bad
hops
arent
the
only
difference
between
the
winners
and
the
losers
moreover
youve
had
the
opportunity
to
see
some
analysis
of
the
world
series
situation
that
makes
the
strong
claim
that
nobody
can
predict
the
ws
winner
with
reliably
greater
accuracy
than
a
coin
biased
only
to
reflect
the
wellknown
home
vs
road
effect
on
winning
percentage
the
stats
are
a
nice
hobby
and
thats
about
it
there
is
no
new
knowledge
being
produced
since
stats
are
summaries
of
events
its
true
that
if
you
know
the
events
you
can
derive
the
stats
but
if
somebody
is
trying
to
understand
the
process
behind
the
stats
then
the
stats
produce
new
knowledge
and
some
of
this
might
even
be
reliable
repeatable
and
useful
speaking
of
which
i
should
get
back
to
producing
knowledge
in
a
different
field
that
is
of
course
if
i
can
produce
knowledge
even
though
im
relying
on
stats
to
do
it

seems
possible
and
need
boggs
to
do
it
i
think
theyre
making
the
same
sort
of
mistake
with
davis
that
boston
made
with
boggs
leaving
him
in
the
minors
for
two
or
three
years
after
hed
shown
that
he
was
a
good
hitter
spike
owen
see

id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
going
to
raise
the
yankee
staff
era
point
and
these
guys
are
on
the
down
sides
of
their
careers
too
bad
they
gave
up
on
randy
valarde
too
many
trips
on
the
columbus
shuttle
hrm
they
still
have
him
on
the
roster
ab
through
the
first
two
weeks
theyve
just
never
figured
out
what
to
do
with
him
i
suspect
that
he
hits
enough
especially
vs
lefties
to
be
a
reasonable
shortstop
one
rumor
running
around
during
spring
training
was
that
they
wanted
to
convert
silvestri
to
be
a
catcher
because
his
body
type
was
wrong
for
a
shortstop
youd
think
that
somebody
in
the
same
division
who
plays

ill
relate

about
a
yankee
fan
at
fenway
last
year
for
opening
day
i
was
there
to
see
them
face
baltimore
and
couldnt
help
but
listen
to
the
boston
fans
talk
about
various
players
on
the
team
one
guy
was
totally
obliterating
boggs
how
he
sucks
etc
i
told
him
i
was
a
yankee
fan
and
id
take
him
in
a
second
and
who
would
he
want
in
a
trade
back
he
said
a
pile
of
sht
i
know
boggs
had
some
personal
problems
while
playing
for
boston
but
come
on
hes
a
future
hall
of
famer
who
really
adds
a
needed
dimension
to
the
yanks
a
solid
hitter
a
decent
fielder
and
more
importantly
a
teacher
ask
pat
kelly
i
think
hes
got
a
few
good
years
left
in
his
bat
and
may
be
a
key
contributor
down
the
stretch
as
they
win
the
american
league
east
this
year
boston
fans
have
no
class
theyll
probably
boo
him
like
crazy
his
first
time
back
in
pinstripes
and
i
hope
he
goes
for
and
shuts

its

that

what
i

it
is
not
just
because
some

made
the

a

it

actually
i
think
the
largescale
sample
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
lets
be
careful
here
if
players
performance
was
completely
random
in
clutchno
clutch
then
you
would
still
expect
some
players
to
be
good
in
the
clutch
every
year
and
some
to
be
notsogood
every
year
with
two
years
worth
of
data
youd
have
of
the
players
good
each
year
bad
each
year
and
would
have
one
good
and
one
bad
year
we
have
players
for
years
just
flipping
a
coin
youd
expect
players
to
be
good
all
years
and
to
be
bad
every
year
this
is
what
we
actually
get
no
of
good
years
clutch
performers
coin
flip
random
essentially
the
distribution
of
clutch
performers
by
number
of
years
of
good
performance
is
the
same
as
what
you
would
get
if
the
process
leading
to
deviations
from
nonclutch
performance
was
completely
random
if
there
was
anything
to
clutch
hitting
at
least
in
this
definition
that
had
any
predictive
capability
you
expect
to
see
the
number
of
players
at
the
ends
to
be
much
larger
than
that
predicted
by
flipping
a
coin
further
if
you
limit
yourself
to
players
who
were
a
lot
above
or
below
average
in
clutch
situations
say
standard
deviation
from
the
mean
more
than
one
year
the
random
explanation
still
looks
good
in
the
four
years
that
i
looked
at
the
data
from
elias
there
were
players
with
a
minimum
of
at
bats
in
clutch
situations
that
were
sigma
from
the
mean
two
different
years
of
those
players
of
them
changed
sign
between
the
two
years
in
other
words
they
were
great
clutch
hitters
one
year
and
really
horrible
the
other
year
if
it
was
just
a
random
process
youd
expect
those
numbers
to
be
everything
thats
been
measured
about
clutch
hitting
over
a
period
of
years
that
could
be
used
to
predict
any
ability
with
any
proposed
definition
has
looked
like
a
random
process
with
the
caveat
that
there
may
be
something
related
to
platoon
advantage
that
could
be
dragged
out
of
the
dataeg
john
lowenstein
probably
never
had
a
clutch
ab
against
a
lefthanded
pitcher
but
he
might
well
have
had
some
in
blowouts
so
that
there
would
be
a
bias
since
his
clutch
abs
would
be
more
geared
to
his
platoon
advantage
this
is
not

every

has
been

find
anything
that
would

to

will
do
in

my
understanding
is

qualify

a

cannot

more
than
three
innings

the
potential
tying

must

a

a

can

the

his

they
score

incident

he
lost

and
the

caught
it
before
each

the
public

makes
a

wherein
he
says
that

are
welcome
to
the
souvenirs

balls
that
are

into

stands
as
long
as
they
do
not
interfere
with
any
that
are
in

was
the
fan
wrong
should
he
have
been
more
aware
of
the
situation
and
acted
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
interference
yes
i
think
he
should
have
done
more
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
much
as
fans
want
to
catch
a
ball
they
really
should
be
aware
that
winning
the
game
is
more
important
as
a
dodger
fan
he
has
to
be
aware
that
this
is
the
home
stadium
and
that
entails
helping
the
home
team
win
in
any
way
possible
as
soon
as
the
ball
was
hit
that
far
his
first
instinct
should
be
to
root
for
darryl
to
catch
it
not
to
try
to
catch
it
himself
particularly
when
he
is
sitting
that
close
i
enjoy
the
attitude
of
the
wrigley
fans
where
they
are
against
visiting
team
home
runs
so
much
they
actually
throw
them
back
on
the
field
now
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
darryl
could
have
caught
it
or
not
sure
he
probably
screwed
up
but
the
fan
should
realize
his
first
responsibility
is
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
help
the

win

i
had
my
first
up
close
and
personal
last
night
at
the
stick
after
watching
giants
hitters
struggle
last
year
barrys
swing
was
very
impressive
hes
very
quick
and
his
swing
seems
effortless
even
compared
to
clark
particularly
clark
as
of
late
it
was
interesting
to
see
bonds
hit
maddux
so
well
im
not
sure
if
barry
was
after
revenge
against
the
braves
or
what
but
he
stroked
three
very
pretty
hits
hr
for
rbis
the
giants
always
hit
maddux
well
but
it
was
interesting
that
maddux
did
not
pitch
around
bonds
to
get
to
clayton
last
night
he
threw
straight
fastballs
over
the
plate
to
bonds
in
the
last
night
got
away
with
the
first
one
but
bonds
hit
the
second
one
out
of
the
park
then
in
the
when
clark
was
at
third
base
with
one
out
maddux
did
not
intentionally
walk
bonds
and
bonds
dropped
a
single
to
leftcenter
the
giants
as
a
team
are
doing
a
lot
of
surprising
things
this
year
in
addition
to
bonds
there
has
been
some
good
pitching
and
some
hitters
seem
to
be
swinging
much
better
claytons
defense
has
been
superb
mcgee
seems
to
like
leading
off
this
year
manwaring
is
driving
the
ball
so
on
so
forth
the
braves
announcers
pointed
out
that
mcgee
as
a
leadoff
hitter
has
not
scored
a
run
yet
he
will
always
hit
around
but
im
concerning
about
his
onbase
percentage
the
key
in
the
lineup
is
matt
williams
he
has
to
stay
hot
so
that
bonds
can
hit
with
runners
on
base
i
hope
it
continuesi
think
they
need
to
continue
well
into
june
before
people
are
really
sold
that
they
are
for
realparticularly
the
pitching
the
pitching
gets
a
set
back
as
bud
black
is
placed
on
the
dl
burba
has
done
a
superb
job
filling
in
so
far
he
looks
like
a
different
pitcher
from
last
year
however
swift
is
terrible
in
both
of
his
starts
with
burba
moving
into
the
rotation
mike
jackson
is
the
only
righthanded
reliever
aside

beck
hell
get

hope

than
roger
craig
especially
on
beck
i
was
concerned
when
beck
was
used
for
straight
days
earlier
this
week
for
myself
i
think
the
fresh
start
of
magowanbakeretc
has
really
wiped
out
a
lot
of
negatives
from
the
last
few
years
and
will
be

we
have
identified
the
cause
and
therefore
will
continue
and
i
am
not
dismissing
your

im
stating
my
opinion
you
are
saying
that
your
work
renders
any
opinion
to
the
contrary
invalid
so
that
the
retention
of
that
opinion
is
some
kind
of
insult
to
your

well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
think
seeing
insults
in
other
peoples
opinions
is
kind
of
silly
after
all
mark
didnt
call
you
a
total
idiot
or
call
your
work
stupid
he
simply
stated
that
it
didnt
change
his
opinion
on
the
subject
i
did
not
say
that
it
is
a
consistent
skill
i
have
said
that
it
is
an
indicator
of
performance
under
a
certain
set
of
circumstances
right
this
is
the
beef
it
has
not
proven
to
be
an
indicator
of
future
performance
under
any
circumstances
at
least
none
that
weve
been
able
to
come
up
with
if
you
know
of
some
where
it
is
an
indicator
of
future
performance
please
let
us
in
on
your
secret
if
player
a
hits
better
on
tuesdays
and
always
has
and
mark
believes
that
it
might
be
an
indication
that
he
will
hit
on
tuesday
better
next
season
as
well
would
you
respond
the
same
way
at
some
point
you
might
admit
that
all
variable
might
not
be
known
to
you
who
knows
what
this
guy
does
every
monday
night
maybe
he
sees
his
sports
shrink
on
tuesday
mornings
or
has
his
vitamin
b
shots
monday
nights
but
this
is
something
thats
true
of
one
guy
only
it
doesnt
mean
that
there
will
be
a
meaningful
correlation
for
the
entire
league
by
days
of
the
week
nor
that
there
should
be
but
it
doesnt
mean
we
cant
make
predictions
based
on
that
for
that
particular
player
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
i
only
see
a
prediction
for
one
player
here
i
dont
see
anything
about
all
batters
heres
another
one
for
you
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
was
significantly
below
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
each
year
i
presume
you
think
this
is
random
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
thats
exactly
what
mark
is
trying
to
do
though
find
hitters
that
have
these
correlation
and
ask
whether
we
can
make
predictions
for
these
hitters
based
on
their
past
performance
major
league
ballplayers
it
just
makes
me
think
that
in
joe
carters
batting
average
in
the
clutch
is
not
going
to
be
as
high
as
his
ba
in
nonclutch
situations
gamblers

there

a

does
gamblers
fallacy
have
to
do
with
anything
whether
you
can
know
the

for

or
not
you
cant
deny
that
it
has
existent
you
can
only
make
an
argument
that
you
dont
think
it
is
likely
to
continue
to
exist
because
you
cant
see
a
reason
for
it
to
exist
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
someone
posted
recently
on
why
negative
clutch
would
correlate
the
argument
along
the
lines
of
star
player
with
lr
splits
will
always
see
an
adverse
condition
in
late
innings
of
a
close
game
ie
opposing
manager
will
always
bring
in
a
ah
pitcher
to
face
him
where
his
manager
will
not
pull
him
for
a
ph
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deny
it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling
to
even
consider
evidence
that
might

that
you
are
wrong

shea

was
designed

a

not
with
the

in

as
the
tennant
the
new

football
giants
had
moved
to
yankee
stadium
from
the
polo
grounds
in
and
was
having
problem
with
stadium
management
the
city
did
not
own
yankee
stadium
until
the
idea
was
to
get
the
giants
to
move
into
shea
when
a
deal
was
worked
out
between
the
giants
and
the
yankees
the
new
afl
franchise
the
new

titans
approached
the
city
about
using
the
new
stadium
the
titans
were
playing
in
downing
stadium
where
the
cosmos
played
soccer
in
the
because
shea
stadium
was
tied
into
the
worlds
fair
anyway
the
city
thought
it
would
be
a
novel
idea
to
promote
the
new
franchise
and
the
worlds
fair
like
they
were
doing
with
the
mets
so
the
deal
was
worked
out
of
course
with
the
jets
gone
to
jersey
and
a
truly
good
football
stadium
the
mets
are
saddled
with
a
multipurpose
stadium
where
because
its
circular
the
seats
are
almost
always
too
far
from

the

announcerskiner
murphy

a
tipoff
to
how
unbeautiful
it
truly
is
im
under
the
impression
that
when
murph
says
it
he
means
it
as

it
is

darryl
has

he
has

i
guess
the
big
debate
continues
as
to
what
are
the
responsibilities
of
the

long

the

he

at

this

he
just

i

many
of
his
games
last

he
did
pitch
some
good
games

this
crap
about
being
a
clutch
pitcher
is
nonsense
he
was
constantly
giving
up
go

runs
in

the
clutch
innings
and
the

would
somehow
scrape
a

another

in
his

is
that

a

giving

stat
by
todays
rules
in
all
of
baseball
my
understanding
is
to
qualify
as
a
save
a
pitcher
cannot
pitch
more
than
three
innings
and
the
potential
tying
run
must
at
least
appear
in
the
ondeck
circle
also
the
lead
a
pitcher
enters
with
cannot
excede
three
runs
this
is
a
phenomenon
known
around
work
as
readyfireaim
i
am
astounded
at
the
number
of
times
people
post
strong
opinions
about
things
they
not
only
dont
understand
but
publicly
admit
to
not
understanding
in
fact
theres
a
plausible
argument
that
saves
are
a
more
rational
stat
than
wins
for
the
record
there
are
two
ways
that
a
reliever
can
get
a
save
he
must
finish
the
game
and
either
have
entered
the
game
with
the
tying
run
on
base
at
bat
or
on
deck
have
pitched
at
least
three
innings
effectively
a
pitcher
may
not
get
a
win
and
a
save
in
the
same
game
i
believe
that
the
official
scorers
must
assert
more
of
their
authority
in
determining
winnerssaversetc
for
instance
a
pitcher
can
come
in
in
the
ninth
with
a
lead
blow
the
lead
fall
behind
have
his
team
come
back
in
the
next
half
inning
and
earn
the
win
has
this
pitcher
earned
a
win
no
way
but
this
is
an
argument
that
wins
is
a
dumb
stat
not
saves
i
guy
could
pitch
five
strong
innings
of
middle
relief
and
see
his
teammates
rally
to
tie
the
score
assume
he
came
in
to
start
the
fourth
and
left
after
the
eighth
his
teammate
holds
the
opposition
scoreless
in
the
ninth
and
they
score
a
run
in
the
bottom
of
the
ninth
to
win
the
third
pitcher
earns
the
win
and
the
middle
reliever
gets
no
stat
satisfaction
this
again
doesnt
support
your
claim
about
saves

the
beginning
of
your

how
does
a
pitcher
get
a
save
in

geoffrey

dias
writes
the
subject
line
says
it
all
what
is
the
rule
that
qualifies
a
pitcher
as
making
a
save
as
far
as
i
know
a
save
opportunity
is
when
it
is
inning
or
beyond
and
the
batter
on
deck
can
either
tie
or
win
the
ball
game
for
example
if
it
is
the
bottom
of
the
inning
and
clemens
is
pithching
the
red
sox
are
leading
and
clemens
has
just
givin
up
a
hit
so
there
is
a
man
on
first
the
batter
and
the
batter
on
deck
could
tie
the
game
with
a
homer
if
jeff
russel
came
in
the
red
sox
reliever
and
finished
the
game
without
allowing
the
tieing
or
losing
run
to
score
he
would
get
the
save
and
clemens
would
get
the
win
thats
how
i
beleive
it
works

performance

clutch

samuel
sabo
is
clearly
a

yet
you
would

samuel
because
you
predict

samuel
will
be
a
clutch
hitter
and
sabo
will
be
a
choke
hitter
right
id
call
that
predicting
the
future
that
is
your
opinion
that
sabo
is
clearly
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
the
above
data
is
for
a
period
ending
last
season
last
season
samuel
batted
while
sabo
hit
not
park
adjusted
this
season
they
are
both
hitting
below
albeit
sabo
with
more
at
bats
i
will
agree
that
over
his
career
sabo
has
been
a
better
hitter
than
samuel
but
i
will
also
remind
you
that
samuel
has
been
a
better
hitter
in
certain
situations
than
sabo
i
did
not
predict
that
sabo
would
choke
nor
that
samuel
would
get
a
hit
i
expressed
my
opinion
that
had
i
been
the
reds
manager
or
even
a
reds
fan
that
i
would
prefer
to
have
samuel
hit
in
that
situation
than
sabo
if
you
were
to
have
been
the
reds
manager
at
that
time
i
assume
you
would
have
had
some
basis
for
letting
sabo
hit
rather
than
pinch
hitting
samuel
im
sure
some
of
that
basis
would
have
utilized
prior
performance
you
just
wouldnt
have
used
this
particular
aspect
of
prior
performance
is
this
not
correct
right
i
would
have
used
aspects
of
prior
performance
which
have
been
shown
to
be
consistent
in
the
past
overall
performance
lr
splits
even
matching
hittingpitching
styles
all
of
these
will
give
me
some
advantage
if
used
properly
ah
properly
yes
i
see
even
if
all
else
were
equal
there
would
be
no
advantage
gained
by
looking
at
past
clutch
performance
and
in
this
case
everything
else
pointed
to
sabo
please
help
me
what
exactly
is
everything
else
that
pointed
to
sabo
well
yes
you
are
aware
of
its
existance
you
claim
to
be
incapable
of
understanding
it
though
i
suspect
you
are
simply
unwilling
yet
you
rather
forcefully
state
the
opposite
you
dont
seem
to
think
the
work
is
worth
reading
yet
you
obviously
feel
the
topic
is
important
id
say
this
is
insulting
i
must
say
i
was
not
aware
of
the
publication
can
you
email
me
the
information
regarding
its
availability
and
i
guess
i
must
apologize
to
all
of
those
who
have
done
extensive
study
on
say
supply
side
economics
i
didnt
mean
to
insult
you
but
i
never
did
believe
you
were
on
the
right
path
im
sorry
for
my
contrary
opinionposition
i
also
regret
that
i
dont
have
the
ability
to
prove
that
you
are
wrong
but
you
are
i
believe
that
by
seasons
end
that
chris
sabos
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
will
be
significantly
lower
than
his
batting
average
in
nonclutch
situations
i
cant
prove
that
it
will
happen
so
i
guess
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
is
this
simply
a
prediction
for
chris
sabo
for
this
year
or
is
this
a
prediction
for
all
batters
who
have
over
the
past
few
years
hit
xxx
amount
worse
in
the
clutch
than
overall
it
is
what
it
says
it
is
if
you
mean
the
first
then
as
you
say
well
just
have
to
wait
and
see
but
the
second
is
a
much
stronger
statement
in
fact
it
suggests
a
rule
we
can
then
test
this
rule
on
past
data
to
see
if
it
worked
for
recent
years
i
think
you
will
agree
that
if
the
rule
didnt
work

or
the

before
that
it
is
unlikely
to
do
any
better
this
year
right
the
second
is
your
statement
not
mine
im
not
going
to
get
into
case
analysis
sure
you
can
find
somebody
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
poorly
in
as
well
you
can
also
find
those
who
hit
poorly
from
and
then
hit
well
in
well
actually
i
havent
yet
but
im
not
finished
looking
that
is
i
havent
yet
found
someone
who
hit
significantly
below
his
overall
batting
average
in
clutch
situations
for
the
years
and
then
reversed
that
relationship
in
gamblers
fallacy
unless
there
is
reason
to
expect
consistency
a
run
proves
nothing
can
you
give
us
a
reason
to
expect
clutch
ba
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
ive
seen
a
detailed
study
of
why
i
shouldnt
expect
it
to
correlate
nope
sorry
but
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
chris
sabos
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
if
you
were
interested
in
a
reason
why
i
expect
joe
carters
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
to
correlate
from
one
year
to
the
next
i
think
i
could
but
youre
not
interested
in
that
because
you
think
that
those
conclusions
could
only
be
valid
if
they
could
be
extrapolated
over
the
entire
baseball
population
and
they
cant
be
the
stupid
was
in
reference
to
a
statement
which
was
stupid
and
i
dont
see
how
you
can
deny
it
as
for
total
idiot
yes
if
you
prove
yourself
unwilling
to
even
consider
evidence
that
might
suggest
that
you
are
wrong
i
would
say
the
term
fits
nicely
the
problem
here
is
that
i
do
believe
you
i
accept
your
work
i
believe
that
trying
to
predict
future
clutch
performance
based
on
prior
clutch
history
is
meaningless
no
better
than
a
coin
toss
i
actually
do
accept
your
work
as
it
happens
i
also
have
an
opinion
that
in
certain
situations
for
certain
players
a
history
of
superior
or
inferior
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
might
suggest
a
reason
what
such
history
could
be
valid
in
projecting
future
player
performance
for
that
player
and
chris
sabo
is
one
such
player
so
tell
me
does
the
term
fit
or
do
you
have
an
open
mind
well
since
i
defer
to
your
statistical
wisdom
i
think
i
must
have
an
open

we

this
may
be
the
root
of
the
confusion
please
consider
the
following
hypothetical
with
an
open

note
that
i
am
not
yet
saying
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
at

suppose
we

a
simplified
lotto
game
detailed

deleted
indeed
you
have
struck
right
at
the
heart
of
our
disagreement
to
rebut
my
opinion
you
have
made
an
analogy
with
a
game
of
chance
your
hypothesis
assumes
that
the
lotto
players
have
no
impact
on
the
selection
of
the
numbers
and
hence
their
ability
to
win
well
thats
certainly
true
in
lotto
but
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
sport
of
baseball
when
you
start
down
the
wrong
path
you
finish
down
the
wrong
path
i
repeat
i
do
not
think
that
statistical
analysis
of
prior
clutch
hitting
performance
is
an
accurate
predictor
of
future
clutch
hitting
performance
i
do
however
think
that
analysis
of
prior
clutch
hitting
performance
may
for
some
players
indicate
a
deficiency
in
their
game
that
indeed
will
provide
a
basis
for
projecting
their
particular
future
performance
and
i

chris

braves
stoppers
the
term
stopper
is
generally
used
to
refer
to
a
pitcher
one
who
can
be
counted
on
to
pitch
a
strong
game
to
keep
his
team
from
going
on

losing
streak
the

have
plenty

right

id

smoltz

to
take
the

what
the

lack
however
is

clemens
pitched
a

nine
innings
allowing
only
two
runs
ryan
pitched
a
couple
shutout
innings
though
he
needed
some
excellent
defensive
plays
behind
him
to
do
so
quantrill
pitched
a
couple
of
innings
gave
up
the
goahead
run
and
got
credited
with
the
win
when
the
sox
scored
two
in
the
bottom
of
the
inning
looks
like
a
team
effort
to
me
yet
only
quantrill
got
credit
for
the
win
how
about
the
offense
dawson
and
vaughn
hit
i
think
hrs
early
in
the
game
without
either
one
the
sox
would
have
lost

quintana
led
off
the
with
a
solid
single
zupcic
pinchran
for
quintana

the
speed
to

melvin

not

it

scrub
richardson

hit

scoring

all
the
way
from

hills
lack
of

helped
cooper
and
zupcic
were

with
runs
melvin
and
richardson
were
credited
with
rbis
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
quintanas
hit
that
set
up
the
whole
inning
and
did
melvin
really
contribute
as
much
as
richardson
furthermore
people
seem
to
consider
rbis
to
be
more
significant
than
runs
did
melvin
contribute
more
than
cooper
cooper
provided
the
gamewinning
baserunner
and
moved
the
tying
run
to
third
base
with

one
out
assigning

other
player
to
be
maligned
in
the
last
couple
years
but
in
any
case
i
believe
mike
lavalliere
has
been
accused
of
poor
work
habits
and
general
sloth
recently
probably
not
malingering
just
as
he
was
being
released
its
interesting
that
nobody
heard
much
about
these
problems
before
if
they
were
so
important
i
have
heard
sanders
called
many
things
as
well
i
have
not
heard
him
called
lazy
given
the
phenomenon
it
would
be
difficult
to
label
him
as
such
exactly
so
which
means
his
media
detractors
have
had
to
say
other
things
about
him
i
believe
its
a
general
phenomenon
that
if
writers
dont
like
you
theyll
find
a
label
that
will
stick
no
matter
who
you
are
i
find
myself
more
interested
in
the
selection
of
labels
than
in
why
writers
feel
they
need
to
act
this
way
not
that
this
fascinates
me
that
much
either
uh
the
original
authors
point
was
that
black
and
white
players
were
por
trayed
differently
by
the
media
and
towards
this
he
gave
a
highly
selected
list
to
prove
his
case
sanders
name
showed
up
eventually
i
dispute
that
sanders
has
ever
been
called
lazy
by
the
media
hmm
big
ego
possible
club
house
disturbance
etc
is
that
good
press
no
but
it
isnt
the
total
extent
of
the
press
he
received
in
pittsburgh
where
he
was
called
all
kinds
of
things
including
lazy
and
spoiled
by
the
local
columnists
again
the
actual
words
used
may
shift
around
with
time
and
expediency
but
lazy
tends
to
be
higher
on
the
list
for
nonwhite
players
at
least
in
my
subjective
opinion
aside
it
might
be
interesting
for
somebody
to
do
an
archival
study
on
player
descriptions
before
and
after
the
color
barrier
was
broken
and
on
teams
like
the
red
sox
which
have
been
traditionally
white
nowadays
most
people
think
of
carl
yastrzemski
as
one
of
those
bluecollar
hardworking
guys
but
in
the
early
he
was
often
portrayed
as
a
lazy
bum
really
hmm
i
never
heard
anyone
accuse
canseco
of
being
lazy
nor
sierra
ive
heard
accusations
that
canseco
was
a
bad
fielder
but
could
be
a
great
one
if
he
put
his
mind
to
it
ignoring
whether
or
not
he
is
a
actually
dave
stewart
is
was
one
of
the
most
vocal
about
this
in
any
event
that
is
not
lazy
at
least
one
poster
in
the
last
week
has
fired
off
a
major
screed
on
the
cansecoislazy
issue
so
i
think
your
point
is
at
best
a
quibble
and
probably
weaker
than
that
uh
that
poster
specifically
stated
allow
me
to
be
the
first
it
is
not
a
quibble
then
to
state
that
the
media
did
not
portray
canseco
as
being
lazy
if
the
other
person
chooses
to
so
accuse
him
after
my
post
that
does
not
make
it
a
quibble
and
in
fact
the
media
around
here
tended
to
play
up
his
time
in
the
wieght
room
hardly
lazy
and
hardly
a
quibble
have
you
ever
seen
any
mediot
portray
canseco
as
lazy
unconcerned
with
his
fielding
yes
lazy
no
bad
fielder
i
think
this
is
still
interesting
for
that
matter
i
think
cansecos
colorful
offfield
antics
get
lots
more
national
attention
than
those
of
say
roger
clemens
well
hes
had
a
few
more
of
them
at
least
more
that
youve
heard
about
i
think
one
of
the
questions
here
surrounds
selective
reporting
having
said
that
i
have
to
say
that
the
selective
reporting
hypothesis
has
the
potential
to
be
unfalsifiable
at
least
by
those
of
us
who
arent
reporters
police
or
private
investigators
well
canseco
has
been
involved
in
several
felonies
including
his
highspeed
record
carrying
concealed
firearms
and
of
course
the
domestic
violence
clemens
had
a
runin
at
a
bar
canseco
had
that
as
well
and
in
both
cases
the
coverage
was
relatively
minimal
puckett

btwwhich
jackson
are
we
talking
about
here
reggie

darrin

or
uh
if
the
only
evidence
offered
is
anecdotal
how
can
it
be
objected
that
the
counter
to
it
is
also
anecdotal
and
it
seems
like
everybody
who
has
ever
won
a
batting
title
among
others
has
been
accused
at
some
time
of
caring
more
for
his
own
stats
than
for
the
good
of
the
team
it
also
seems
to
me
that
youre
kirby
puckett
i
have
never
heard
this
accusation
made
of
puckett
i
have
heard
it
of
boggs
actually
i
believe
it
of
him
but
thats
another
matter
not
living
in
minnesota
i
cant
say
whether
or
not
this
line
has
ever
been
used
against
kirby
there
as
far
as
boggs
goes
im
not
sure
why
you
bring
him
up
since
hes
one
of
the
obvious
prototypes
for
the
line
i
quoted
along
with
ted
williams
rod
carew
and
many
others
uh
yes
and
i
agree
with
your
assesment
of
boggs
rather
specifically
however
you
did
say
everybody
who
has
ever
won
a
batting
title
has
been
accused
of
selfishness
i
have
not
ever
anywhere
heard
this
said
of
puckett
pendleton
either
similarly
brett
b
williams
and
others
how
about
daryl
strawberry
and
i
think
the
plus
or
minus
refers
more
to
the
born
again
types
ie
butler
and
gaetti
again
you
seem
to
be
making
an
argument
from
anecdotes
on
the
other
hand
my
argument
by
is
of
the
becausejonsaysso
variety
if
we
have
no
other
data
i
have
to
admit
i
have
problems
generating
lists
of
nonwhite
players
who
became
infamous
for
their
religious
or
political
beliefs
while
names
like
butler
gaetti
dravecky
knepper

et
al
come
rolling
out
there
are

they
are

did
you

i

this
was
an

attempt
by
gant
to
do
so

hirschbeck
he
left
hirschbeck
no

to
take
control

his

needed
him

and
he
lost

hirschbeck
was
it
just
me
or
did
it
look

hirschbeck
pointed
to
the
umpire
before
calling
that
strike
i
thought
thats
why
gant
was
asking
for

appeal

obvious
that
he

no

finally

gant
shouldnt
have

hirschbeck
not
returning
made
the
strike
call
fairly
likely
although
i
suspect
an
argument
might
have
gotten
gant
tossed
altogether
but
if
hirschbeck
had
let
gant
step
out
the
whole
incident
probably
would
have
been
avoided
your
listing
pretty
much
agreed
with
what
i
saw
with
the
aforementioned
addendums
perhaps
it
appeared
differently
at
the
ballpark
personally
i
was
amazed
that
gant
didnt
get
ejected
but
thats
why
cox
did
its
called
protecting
your
players
and
to
those
people
who
would
have
thrown
everyone
out
of
the
game
all
i
can
say
is
that
youd
be
making
baseball
history
even
in
the
worst
baseball
brawls
usually
only
the
major
instigators
are
ejected
not
everyone
who
comes
onto
the
field
and
id
have
to
say
that
those
brawls
are
considerably
more
threatening
to
the
game
than
what
the
braves
did
fri
night
anyhow
thats
my
last
two
cents
on
the
subject
barring
outrageous
postings
i
will
try
to
keep
my
eyes
open
for
more
incidents
involving
hirschbeck
i
think
there
will
be

after
vizquel
made
that
barehanded
grab
of
the
chopper
up
the

someone
remarked
that
if
he
had
fielded
it
with
his
glove
he
wouldnt
have
had
time
to
throw
riles
out
yet
the
throw
beat
riles
by
about
two
steps
i
wonder
how
many
others
who
watched
the
final
out
think
vizquel
had
no
choice
but
to
make
the
play
with
his
bare
hand
in
this
mornings
paper
or
was
it
on
the
radio
vizquel
was
quoted
as
saying
that
he
could
have
fielded
the
ball
with
his
glove
and
still
easily
thrown
out
riles
that
he
barehanded
it
instead
so
as
to
make
the
final
play
more
memorable
seems
a
litle
cocky
to
me
but
he
made
it
work
so
hes
entitled
i
guess
so
still
thats
kind
of
a
stupid
move
imo
hed
be
singing
a
different
tune
if
he
had
booted
it

the

velarde
yes
maybe
the
yanks
should
have
let
him
develop
but
he
rode
the
columbus
shuttle
way
too
many
times
to
do
so
probably
the
fault
of
george
but
no
matter
now
his
usefulness
is
done
he
will
not
be
able
to
develop
into
a
good
player
this
deep
in
his
career
at
least
i
dont
think
so
his
fielding
is
horrendous
at
maybe
hed
be
good
at
short
he
cant
his
the
curve
at
all
and
i
think
all
his
trips
from
new
york
to
columbus
and
back
have
demoralized
him
to
the
point
that
he
just
doesnt
care
get
rid
of
him
i
saythe
sooner
the
better
for
both
the
yanks
and
velarde
keith

lets

velarde
hasnt
been
to
columbus
if
i
recall
for
about
three
years
granted
he
hasnt
been
a
full
time
player
but
when
he
does
play
ive
always
thought
he
had
a
good
bat
he
might
be
demoralized
about
not
playing
full
time
but
he
hasnt
been
shuttled
around
i
think
hes
been
in
new
york
ever
since
he
had
hits
in
ab
back
in
or
i
believe
i
dont
think
he
is
gold
glove
calibre
but
he
doesnt
boot
it
around
either
i
think
if
velarde
is
given
a
chance
he
could
become
extremely
productive
i
dont
have
any
stats
to
back
this
up
and
i
dont
know
if
his
defense
would
cost
any
games
but
i
think
he
could
help
and
he
has
this
year
he
has
hr
already
same
goes
for
jim
leyrtiz
he
has
a
big
mouth
but
he
does
get
the
job
done
when
he
concentrates
i
think
the
situation
with
leyritz
is
that
he
believes
he
is
a
potential
superstar
and
he
gets
pissed
about
not
playing
i
think
he
might
have
realized
something
when
the

the
key

in

and
a

isnt

just
for

out

hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the

or
fielding
of

throw
to

because
the

opted
to
throw
the

over
the

head
theres
no
inter
ference
sorry
i
still
dont
buy
it
youre
certainly
right
that
the
runner
is
not
out
merely
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
he
must
interfere
with
the
play
but
the
argument
here
is
over
what
constitutes
interference
you
certainly
cannot
infer
from
what
youve
quoted
that
the
batterrunner
must
be
hit
by
the
ball
to
be
guilty
of
interference
you
havent
posted
a
definition
of
interference
at
all
imo
this
calls
for
one
of
the
approved
rulings
that
go
in
small
print
in
the
rulebook
something
like
approved
ruling
if
in
the
judgement
of
the
umpire
the
runner
by
running
to
the
left
of
the
allowed
path
caused
the
fielder
to
make
a
bad
throw
blocks
the
vision
of
the
fielder
receiving
the
throw
or
otherwise
impedes
the
defensive
teams
making
a

on
him
the
batterrunner
shall
be
judeged
guilty
of
interference
or
approved
ruling
the
runner
cannot
be
judged
guilty
of

in
the
unless

makes

that

and
was

if

was

i

he
was
just

heal

question
is
derek
lilliquist
the
main
closer
for
the

now
that
olin

i
need

i

far
lilliquist

how

the

maybe
a

like
sheffield

rbieven
though
it
was
probably
a

can
be

the

sheffield
faces
is
faster

not

sheffield
also
has
better

more

the

probably
tell

if

it
might

hi

and
i
have
been
into

mlb

since
almost
one
year
now
there
are
many
problems
occuring
for
me
one
of
them
is
the
era
statistic
for
pitchers
what
does
it
say
era
indicates
the
average
number
of
earned
runs
attributed
to
a
pitcher
per
nine
inning
game
thus
if
a
pitcher
pitched
innings
and
gave
up
earned
run
his
inning
equivelent
perfomance
would
be
earned
runs
thus
his
era
is
to
compute
the
era
you
simply
take
the
number
of
earned
runs
divided
by
the
innings
pitched
and
then
multiple
the
result
by
era
erip
i
think
there
is
another
formula
for
era
i
heard
something
about
it
last
year
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
im
gonna
give
it
a
stab
it
allows
for
a
pitcher
to
pitch
more
than
innings
at
a
time
and
not
benefit
cuz
it
uses
outs
recorded
instead
of
innings
pitched
era
recorded
like
i
said
im
not
sure
this
is
exactly
it
but
im
pretty
sure
they
changed
it
to
something
of
the
sort
an
earned
run
is
run
that
is
given
up
by
the
pitcher
that
is
not
attributed
to
a
fielding
error
more
specifically
if
an
error
occurs
that
represented
the
third
out
all
runs
scored
after
the
error
are
considered
unearned
runs
earned
runs
are
also
runs
scored
as
a
result
of
players
who
were
left
on
base
when
the
pitcher
exited
the
game
here
are
some
examples
if
there
are
two
outs
in
an
inning
and
there
are
men
on
base
if
an
error
occurs
that
represents
the
third
out
all
of
the
runs
after
this
error
and
not
counted
as
earned
runs
if
a
pitcher
issues
some
base
on
balls
walks
and
leaves
the

its
not

to
ask
that
if
a

can
be

by
halfanhour
by
cutting
out
warmup
pitches
dawdling
outside

commercial

and
that
sort

thing
im
not
asking

how
do
you
know
they

by

has
anybody
done
a
study
to
determine
how
much
time
is
actually
wasted
say
in
these
as
games
oh
probably
ms
nichols
has
given
the
average
game
times
and
average
runs
scored
for
and
a
very
nice
piece
of
information
ms
nichols
who
knows
she
may
be
listening
and
not
have
me
in
her
kill
file
after
all
those
numbers
indicate
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
halfarun
less
being
scored
per
game
and
the
games
taking
minutes
longer
something
is
being
done
now
that
wasnt
done
ten
years
ago
which
is
extending
the
games
by
minutes
ms
nichols
thinks
its
more
pitches
given
the
increasing
specialization
of
pitchers
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
if
its
not
simply
more
pitches
though
i
dont
think
its
unreasonable
to
think
that
something
can
be
done
to
get
ten
of
those
minutes
back
then
i
get
a
couple
more
from
shortening
the
warmup
time
for
a
relief
pitcher
after
he
comes
in
and
a
couple
more
still
from
enforcing
existing
rules
which
have
been
stated
in
other
posts
in
this
thread
and
other
related
ones
the
problem
is
who
decides
whether
that
time
is
wasted
you
dont
seem
to
think
it
is
at
all
right
now
i
think
it
is
although
i
have
heard
one
case
favoring
giving
the
reliever
all
the
warmups
he
thinks
he
needs
the
difference
in
mounds
between
the
field
and
pen
but
who
knows
if
the
rules
get
changed
maybe
something
i
didnt
foresee
will
happen
to
change
my
mind
but
you
can
bet
a
lot
of
minds
would
fail
to
foresee
the
same
thing
or
else
nothing
will
be

yes
you
might
in
fact
you
did
not
that
you
were
asking
me
specifically
the
next
question
is
why
would
a
mailing
list
be
more
appropriate
we
dont
all
get
mailing
lists
we
surely
dont
all
get
mailing
lists
about
the
teams
about
which
we
are
most
enthused
so
it
seems
to
me
rsbaseball
is
an
appropriate
place
to
look
for
information
about
teams
one
doesnt
necessarily
follow
daytoday
this
is
not
intended
as
flamage
but
rather
is
an
attempted
answer
as
you
posed
your
post
as
a

pathetic
winker
subject
re
bring
on
the
os
i
heard
that
eli
is
selling
the
team
to
a
group
in
cinninati
this
would
help
so
that
the
os
could
make
some
real
free
agent
signings
in
the
offseason
training
camp
reports
that
everything
is
pretty
positive
right
now
the
backup
catcher
postion
will
be
a
showdown
between
tackett
and
parent
although
i
would
prefer
parent
draft
pick
jeff
hammonds
may
be
coming
up
faster
in
the

hierarchy
of
the
minors
faster
than
expected
mike
flanagan
is
trying
for
another
comeback
big
ben
is
being
defended
by
coaches
saying
that
while
the
homers
given
up
were
an
awful
lot
most
came
in
the
beginning
of
the
season
and
he
really
improved
the
second
half
this
may
be
bens
year
i
feel
that
while
this
may
not
be
mussinas
cy
young
year
he
will
be
able
to
pitch
the
entire
season
without
periods
of
fatigue
like
last
year
around
august
i
really
hope
baines
can
provide
the
rf
support
the
os
need
orsulak
was
decent
but
i
had
hoped
that
chito
martinez
could
learn
defense
better
and
play
like
he
did
in
the
os
right
now
dont
have
many
lefthanded
hitters
anderson
proving
last
year
was
no
fluke
and
cals
return
to
his
averages
would
be
big
plusses
in
a
drive
for
the
pennant
the
rotation
should
be
sutcliffe
mussina
mcdonald
rhodes
olson
is
an
interesting
case
will
he
strike
out
the
side
or
load
the
bases
and
then
get
three
pop
outs
you
never
know
the
way
i
see
the
al
east
this
year
with
personal
biases
mixed
in
baltimore
new
york
toronto
milwaukee
cleveland
boston
detroit
the
top
are
the
only
true
contenders
in
my
mind
one
of
these
will
definitely
win
the
division
unless
it
snows
in
hellmaryland
i
feel
that
this
baltimores
season
to
finally
put
everything
together

hello
my
friends
and

are
running

homewood
fantasy
baseball
league
pure
fantasy
baseball
teams
unfortunely
we
are
running
the
league
using
earl
weaver
baseball
ii
with
the
comm
disk
ii
and
we
need
the
stats
for
the
season
preferably
the
major
league
stat
disk
we
have
the
total
stats
but
needs
the
split
stats
otherwise
we
have
inning
games
because
the
comm
disk
turns
total
stats
into
vs
ls
stats
unless
you
know
both
right
and
left
handed
stats
so
if
anyone
has
the
stat
disk
please
email
