recommend
a

use
on

suggest
mcquires
plastic

it
will
help
somewhat
but
nothing
will
remove

without
making
it
worse
than
it
already
is
mcquires
will
do
something
for

also
suggest
calling
your
local
plastic
shop
in
calif
tap
plastic
is
a
chain
that
carries
most
of
what
is
needed
for
repair
and
sometimes
replacement
of
plastic
bits
telephone
in
the
bay
area
is
im
not
sure
how
amenable
they
are
to
shipping
i
have
found
that
they
have
several
excellent
products
for
cleaning
and
removing
crap
from
windscreens
and
face
shields
also
they
have
one
called
liftit
which
works
real
well
in
removing
sticky
stuffs
such
as
adhessives
from

wihtout

how

if
the
most
frequently
asked
question
in
recmotorcycles
is
what
is
the
dod
then
the
second
most
frequently
asked
question
must
be
how
do
i
get
a
dod
number
that
is
as
simple
as
asking
the
keeper
of
the
list
kotl
accept
no
substitue
keepers
for
a
number
if
youre
feeling
creative
and
your
favorite
number
hasnt
been
taken
already
you
can
make
a
request
subject
to
kotl
approval
warning
nonnumeric
non
number
requests
are
likely
to
earn
a
flame
from
the
kotl
not
that
you
wont
get
it
but
you
will
pay
for
it
oh
and
just
one
little
tiny
suggestion
ask
the
kotl
in
email
youll
just
be
playing
the
lightning
rod
for
flames
if
you
post
to
the
whole
net
and
youll
look
like
a
clueless
newbie
too
by
now
youre
probably
asking
so
whos
the
kotl
already
well
as
john
sloan
notes
below
thats
about
the
only
real
secret
left
around
here
but
a
few
unsubtle
hints
can
be
divulged
first
it
is
not
myself
nor
anyone
mentioned
by
name
in
this
posting
maybe
though
john
was
the
original
kotl
second
in
keeping
with
the
true
spirit
of
unix
the
kotls
first
name
is
only
two
letters
long
and
can
be
spelled
entirely
with
hexadecimal
characters
the
kotl
shares
his
name
with
a
line
oriented
text
utility
third
he
has
occasionally
been
seen
posting
messages
bestowing
new
dod
numbers
mostly
to
boneheads
with
weenie
mailers
fourth
there
is
reason
to
suspect
the
kotl
of
being
a
deadhead
newsflash
a
message
from
the
kotl
once
you
have
surmounted
this
intellectual
pinnacle
and
electronically
groveled
to
the
kotl
please
keep
in
mind
that
the
kotl
does
indeed
work
for
a
living
and
occasionally
must
pacify
its
boss
by
getting
something
done
your
request
may
languish
in
mailer
queue
for
gasp
days
perhaps
even
horrors
a
week
or
two
during
such
times
of
economic
activity
on
the
part
of
the
kotls
employers
sending
yet
another
copy
of
your
request
will
not
speed
processing
of
the
queue
it
just
makes
it
longer
verification
of
this
phenominon
is
left
as
an
excersize
for
the
reader
if
you
suspect
mailer
problems
at
least
annotate
subsequent
requests
with
an
indication
that
a
former
request
was
submitted
lest
you
be
assigned
multiple
numbers
what
you
think
the
kotl
memorizes
the
list
one
more
thing
the
kotl
says
that
its
telepathic
powers
arent
what
they
used
to
be
so
provide
some
information
for
the
list
will
ya
the
typical
dod
list
entry
contains
number
name
statecountry
email
address
for
example
greencaedgreeneastsuncom
ps
while
john
mentions
below
that
net
access
and
a
bike
are
the
only
requirements
for
dod
membership
thats
not
strictly
true
these
days
as
there
are
a
number
of
denizens
who
lack
one
or
both

august
reprinted
with

there
is
a
group
of
motorcyclists
that
gets

and

all

and

they
argue
with
each
other
and
plan
rides
together
the
difference
between
this
group
and
your
local
motorcycle
club
is
that
although
they
get
together
just
about
everyday
most
have
never
seen
each
other
face
to
face
the
members
of
this
group
live
all
over
the
known
world
and
communicate
with
each
other
electronically
via
computer
the
computers
range
from
laptops
to
multimillion
dollar
computer
centers
the
people
range
from
college
and
university
students
to
hightech
industry
professionals

electronic

currently
recmotorcycles
pronounced

its
the
file
name
for
the
groups
primary
online
meeting
place
carries
about
articles
per
month
it
is
read
by
an
estimated
people
most
of
the
frequent
posters
belong
to
a
motorcycle
club
the
denizens
of
doom
usually
referred
to
as
the
dod
the
dod
started
when
motorcyclist
john
r
nickerson
wrote
a
couple
of
parodies
designed
to
poke
fun
at
motorcycle
stereotypes
fellow
computer
enthusiast
bruce
robinson
posted
these
articles
under
the
pen
name
denizen
of
doom
a
while
later
chuck
rogers
signed
off
as
dod
nr
keeper
of
the
flame
bruce
was
then
designated
dod
nr
retroactively
and
of
course
nickerson
the
originator
of
the
parodies
was
given
dod
nr
the
idea
of
a
motorcycle
club
with
no
organization
no
meetings
and
no
rules
appealed
to
many
so
john
sloan
dod
nr
became
keeper
of
the
list
issuing
dod
numbers
to
anyone
who
wanted
one
to
date
there
have
been
almost
memberships
issued
to
people
all
over
the
united
states
and
canada
as
well
as
australia
new
zealand
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
norway
and
finland
keeper
of
the
list
sloan
eventually
designed
a
club
patch
the
initial
run
of
patches
sold
out
immediately
the
profits
from
this
went
to
the
american
motorcycle
heritage
foundation
another
amhf
fund
raiser
selling
denizens
of
doom
pins
to
members
was
started
by
arnie
skurow
a
few
months
later
again
the
project
was
successful
and
the
profits
were
donated
to
the
foundation
so
far
the
denizens
have
contributed
over
to
the
ama
museum
a
plaque
in
the
name
of
the
denizens
of
doom
now
hangs
in
the
motorcycle
heritage
museum
as
often
as
possible
the
doders
crawl
out
from
behind
their
crts
and
go
riding
together
it
turns
out
that
the
two
largest
concentrations
of
doders
are
centered
near
denverboulder
colorado
and
in
californias
silicon
valley
consequently
two
major
events
are
the
annual
assault
on
rollins
pass
in
colorado
and
the
northern
versus
southern
california
joust
the
rideandfeed
is
a
bike
trip
over
rollins
pass
followed
by
a
big
barbecue
dinner
the
concept
for
the
joust
is
to
have
riders
from
northern
california
ride
south
riders
from
southern
california
to
ride
north
meeting
at
a
predesignated
site
somewhere
in
the
middle
an
additional
plan
for
is
to
hold
an
official
denizens
of
doom
homecoming
in
conjunction
with
the
ama
heritage
homecoming
in
columbus
ohio
in
july
though
its
a
safe
bet
the
the
denizens
of
doom
and
their
collective
communications
hub
recmotorcycles
will
not
replace
the
more
traditional
motorcycle
organizations
for
those
who
prowl
the
electronic
pathways
in
search
of
twowheeled
camaraderie
its
a
great
way
for
kindred
spirits
to
get
together
long
may
they
flame
live
to
flame
flame
to
live
centerbar
this
official
motto
of
the
denizens
of
doom
refers
to
the
ease
with
which
you
can
gratuitously
insult
someone
electronically
when
you
would
not
do
anything
like
that
face
to
face
these
insults
are
known
as
flames
issuing
them
is
called
flaming
flames
often
start
when
a
member
disagrees
with
something
another
member
has
posted
over
the
network
a
typical
sophisticated
intelligent
form
of
calm
reasoned
rebuttal
would
be
something
like
what
an
incredibly
stupid
statement
you
spandexclad
poseur
this
will
guarantee
that
five
other
people
will
reply
in
defense
of
the
original
poster
describing
just
what
they
think
of
you
your
riding
ability
and
your
cat
the
denizens
of
doom
the
saga
unfolds
by
john
sloan
dod
periodically
the
question
what
is
dod
is
raised
this
is
one
of
those
questions
in
the
same
class
as
why
is
the
sky
blue
if
there
is
a
god
why
is
there
so
much
suffering
in
the
world
and
why
do
women
inevitably
tell
you
that
youre
such
a
nice
guy
just
before
they
dump
you
the
kinds
of
questions
steeped
in
mysticism
tradition
and
philosophy
questions
that
have
inspired
research
and
discussion
by
philosophers
in
locker
rooms
motorcycle
service
bays
and
in
the
halls
of
academe
for
generations
a
long
long
time
ago
in
computer
time
where
anything
over
a
few
minutes
is
an
eternity
and
the
halting
problem
really
is
a
problem
on
a
computer
far
far
away
on
the
net
topologically
speaking
two
machines
in
the
same
room
in
atlanta
might
route
mail
to
one
another
via
a
system
in
chicago
a
chap
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
but
who
was
eventually
assigned
the
dod
membership
wrote
a
satire
of
the
various
personalities
and
flame
wars
of
recmotorcycles
and
signed
it
the
denizen
of
doom
not
wishing
to
identify
himself
he
asked
that
stalwart
individual
who
would
in
the
fullness
of
time
become
dod
to
post
it
for
him
dod
not
really
giving
a
whit
about
what
other
people
thought
and
generally
being
a
right
thinking
individual
did
so
flaming
and
other
amusements
followed
he
who
would
become
the
holder
of
dod
membership
thought
this
was
the
funniest
thing
hed
seen
in
a
while
being
the
sort
that
is
pretty
easily
amused
so
he
claimed
membership
in
the
denizens
of
doom
motorcycle
club
and
started
signing
his
postings
with
his
membership
number
perhaps
readers
of
recmotorcycles
were
struck
with
the
vision
of
a
motorcycle
club
with
no
dues
no
rules
no
restrictions
as
to
brand
or
make
or
model
or
national
origin
of
motorcycle
a
club
organized
electronically
it
may
well
be
that
readers
were
yearning
to
become
a
part
of
something
that
would
provide
them
with
a
greater
identity
a
gestalt
personality
something
in
which
the
whole
was
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
could
also
be
that
were
all
computer
nerds
who
wear
black
socks
and
sneakers
and
pocket
protectors
who
just
happen
to
also
love
taking
risks
on
machines
with
awesome
power
to
weight
ratios
social
outcasts
who
saw
a
clique
that
would
finally
be
open
minded
enough
to
accept
us
as
members
in
a
clear
case
of
self
fulfilling
prophesy
the
denizens
of
doom
motorcycle
club
was
born
a
club
in
which
the
majority
of
members
have
never
met
one
another
face
to
face
and
perhaps
like
it
that
way
yet
feel
that
they
know
one
another
pretty
well
or
well
enough
given
some
of
the
electronic
personalities
in
the
newsgroup
a
club
organized
and
run
in
the
loosest
sense
of
the
word
by
volunteers
through
the
network
via
electronic
news
and
mail
with
a
membershipmailing
list
often
used
to
organize
group
rides
amongst
members
who
live
in
the
same
region
a
motto
a
logo
a
series
of
photo
albums
circulating
around
the
country
organized
by
dod
club
patches
organized
by
and
even
an
mtvstyle
music
video
produced
by
and
distributed
on

by
where
will
it
end
who
knows
will
the
dod
start
sanctioning

placing
limits
on
the
memory
and
clock
rate
of
the

management
computers
will
the
dod
organize
poker
runs
where
each
participant
collects
a
hand
of
hardware
and
software
reference
cards
will
the
dod
have
a
rally
in
which
the
attendees
demand
a
terminal
room
and
at
least
a
unix
system
only
time
will
tell
the
dod
has
no
dues
no
rules
and
no
requirements
other
than
net
access
and
a
love
for
motorcycles
to
become
a
member
one
need
only
ask
although
we
will
admit
that
who
you
must
ask
is
one
of
the
few
really
good
club
secrets
new

will
receive

why
you
have
to
be
killed
well
the
first
thing
you
have
to
understand
just
in
case
you
managed
to
read
this
far
and
still
not
figure
it
out
is
that
the
dod
started
as
a
joke
and
in
the
words
of
one
denizen
it
intends
to
remain
one
sometime
in
the
far
distant
past
a
hapless
newbie
asked
what
does
dod
stand
for
its
not
the
department
of
defense
is
it
naturally
a
denizen
who
had
watched
the
movie
top
gun
a
few
times
too
many
rose
to
the
occasion
and
replied
thats
classified
we
could
tell
you
but
then
wed
have
to
kill
you
and
the
rest
is
history
a
variation
on
the
security
theme
is
to
supply
disinformation
about
what
dod
stands
for
notable
contributions
and
contributers
where
known
include
daughters
of
democracy
dod
doers
of
donuts
dancers
of
despair
dod
debasers
of
daughters
dickweeds
of
denver
driveway
of
death
debauchers
of
donuts
dumpers
of
dirtbikes
note
that
this
is
not
a
comprehensive
list
as
variations
appear
to
be
limited
only
by
the
contents
of
ones
imagination
or
dictionary
file
the
recmotophoto
archive
first
a
bit
of
history
this
all
started
with
ilana
stern
and
chuck
rogers
organizing
a
recmotorcycles
photo
album
many
copies
were
made
and
several
sets
were
sent
on
tours
around
the
world
only
to
vanish
in
unknown
locations
then
bruce
tanner
decided
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
an
electronic
medium
to
have
an
electronic
photo
album
bruce
has
not
only
provided
the
disk
space
and
ftp
email
access
but
he
has
taken
the
time
to
scan
most
of
the
photos
that
are
available
from
the
archive
not
only
can
you
see
what
all
these
folks
look
like
you
can
also
gawk
at
their
motorcycles
a
few
nonphoto
files
are
available
from
the
server
too
they
include
the
dod
membership
list
the
dod
yellow
pages
the
general
recmotorcycles
faq
and
this
faq
posting
here
are
a
couple
of
excerpts
from
from
messages
bruce
posted
about
how
to
use
the
archive
via

cerritosedu
via

the

the

are
given
in
the

of

the

are

the

the

you

a
couple
of
comments
bruce
has
put
quite
a
bit
of
effort
into
this
so
why
not
drop
him
a
note
if
you
find
the
recmotophoto
archive
useful
second
since
bruce
has
provided
the
server
as
a
favor
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
access
it
after
normal
working
hours
california
time
patches
what
patches
you
may
have
heard
mention
of
various
dod
trinkets
such
as
patches
pins
and
your
reaction
was
probably
i
want
or
thats
sick
or
perhaps
thats
sick
i
want
well
theres
some
good
news
and
some
bad
news
the
good
news
is
that
theres
been
an
amazing
variety
of
dodlabeled
widgets
created
the
bad
news
is
that
there
isnt
anywhere
you
can
buy
any
of
them
this
isnt
because
of
any
exclusivity
attempt
but
simply
because
there
is
no
dod
store
that
keeps
a
stock
all
of
the
creations
have
been
done
by
individual
denizens
out
of
their
own
pockets
the
typical
procedure
is
someone
says
im
thinking
of
having
a
dod
frammitz
made
theyll
cost
xxxx
with
xxxx
going
to
the
ama
museum
anyone
want
one
then
orders
are
taken
and
a
batch
of
frammitzes
large
enough
to
cover
the
prepaid
orders
is
produced
and
quickly
consumed
so
if
you
want
a
dod
doodad
act
quickly
the
next
time
somebody
decides
to
do
one
or
produce
one
yourself
if
you
see
a
void
that
needs
filling
after
all
this
is
anarchy
in
action

possibly
incomplete
list

i
rode

last
friday
night
miles
in
rain
and
darkness
no

got
it
home
and
put
it
on
the

the
next
day
i
pushed
it
off
the

stand
in
preparation
for
going
over
to
a
friends
house
to
pose
you
guessed
it
it
got
away
from
me
and
landed
on
its
right
side
scratched
the

cracked
the

and
cracked
the
upper

damn
am
i
stupid
its
going
to
cost
me
to
get
the
local
body
shop
to
fix
it
and
that
is
after
i
take
the
fairing
off
for
them
still
thats
probably
cheaper
than
the
mirror
alone
if
i
bought
a
replacement
from

you
got
off

my
sisters
exboyfriend
was
such
an
incessant
pain
in
the
ass
about
wanting
to
ride
my
bikes
no
way
jose
that
i
finally
took
him
to
lindners
bmw
in
new
canaan
ct
last
fall
where
i
had
seen
a
nice
used
in
perfect
condition
after
telling
everyone
in
the
shop
his
norton
war
stories
from
fifteen
years
ago
signing
the
liability
waiver
and
getting
his
preflight
off
he
went
well
not
quite
i
walked
out
of
a
pizza
shop
up
the
street
feeling
good
about
myself
made
my
sisters
boyfriend
happy
and
got
the
persistent
wanker
off
my
ass
for
good
heard
the
horrendous
racket
of
an
engine
tortured
to
its
red
line
and
then
a
crash
i
saw
people
running
towards
the
obvious
source
of
the
disturbance
jeff
laying
under
the
bmw
with
the
rear
wheel
spinning
wildly
and
someone
groping
for
the
kill
switch
i
stared
in
disbelief
with
a
slice
hanging
out
of
my
mouth
as
matty
the
shop
manager
slid
up
beside
me
and
asked
friend
of
yours
steve
shit
matty
it
could
have
been
worse
that
could
been
my
flhs
jeff
hadnt
made
it
inches
witnesses
said
he
lifted
his
feet
before
letting
out
the
clutch
and
gravity
got
the
best
of
him
jeff
claimed
that
the
clutch
didnt
engage
matty
was
quick
while
jeff
was
still
stuttering
in
embarrassed
shock
he
managed
to
snatch
jeffs
credit
card
for
a
quick
imprint
and
signature
twenty
minutes
later
when
jeffs
color
had
paled
to
a
flush
matty
presented
him
with
an
estimate
of
for
a
busted
right
mirror
and
a
hairline
crack
in
the
fairing
that
was
for
fixing
the
crack
and
masking
the
damaged
area
not
a
new
fairing
or
he
could
buy
the
bike
im
not
sure
what
happened
later
as
my
sister
split
up
with
jeff
shortly
afterwards
to
hook
up
with
another
piece
of
work

that

told

what

lets
begin
by
saying

its

was
definately
hawk
additionally
it
had
a
style
tank
full
fairing
and
only
a

now
at

i
thought
it
was
an
a
hawk
modified
by
two
brothers
racing
but
i
did
not
think
that
they
made
this
huge
tank
for
it
additionally
the
gauges
were
certainly
not
from
a
hawk
they
looked
much
more
like
gauges
overall
the
bike
looked
like
a
except
for
the
rear
singlesided
swingarm
and
wheel
there
were
straight
from

i
need
a

if
so
what
kind
should
i
get
both

are
volt
i
did
some
backoftheeyelids
calculations
last
night
and
i
figure
these
puppies
suck
up
about
amps
to
work
at
maximum
efficiency
ie
the
cager
might
need
a
shovel
to
clean
out
his

assumptions
at
one

neglecting
solid
angle
considerations
and
end
effects
and
other
acoustic
niceties
from
the
shape
of
the
horn
itself
this
is
a
power
output
of
watts
is
approx
amps
yes
get
a
relay

me
how
you
did
it

after

had
heard
just

then
some

that

was
not

for

the

looked
over

purched
on

and
said
in

riding

last
week
via

suisun
to
i
was
pulled
over
by
a
chp
black
and
white
by
the
gas
station
by
jameson
canyon
road
the
officer
stated
it
looked
like
you
were
going
kinda
fast
coming
down
highway
you
must
have
been
going
at
least
or
i
just
said
okay
and
did
not
agree
or
disagree
to
anything
he
said
can
you
beat
this
ticket
personally
i
think
its
your
duty
as
a
citizen
to
make
it
as
much
trouble
as
possible
for
them
so
maybe
theyll
give
up
and
leave
us
alone
someday
soon
the
cop
was
certainly
within
his
legal
rights
to
nail
you
by
guessing
your
speed
mr
brown
the
author
of
fight
your
ticket
mentions
an
oakland
judge
who
convicted
a
speeder
on
the
officers
testimony
that
the
drivers
car
sounded
like
it
was
being
driven
at
an
excessive
speed
you
can
pay
off
the
state
and
your
insurance
company
or
you
can
take
it
to
court
and
be
creative
personally
ive
never
won
that
way
or
seen
anyone
win
but
the
judge
always
listens
politely
and
i
havent
seen
that
many
attempts
you
could
try
the
argument
that
since
bikes
are
shorter
than
the
cars
whose
speed
the
nice
officer
is
accustomed
to
guessing
they
therefore
appear
to
be
further
away
and
so
their
speed
appears
to
be
greater
than
it
actually
is
i
left
out
a
step
or
two
but
you
get
the
idea
if
you
can
make
it
convincing
theoretically
youre
supposed
to
win
ive
never
tried
proving
the
cop
was
mistaken
i
did
get
to
see
some
other
poor
biker
try
it
he
was
mixing
up
various
facts
like
the
maximum
acceleration
of
a
cop
car
and
the
distance
at
which
the
cop
had
been
pacing
him
and
end
up
demonstrating
that
he
couldnt
possibly
have
been
going
as
fast
as
the
cop
had
suggested
hed
brought
diagrams
and
a
calculator
he
was
prepared
he
lost
keep
in
mind
cops
do
this
all
the
time
and
their
word
is
better
than
yours
maybe
though
they
dont
guess
how
fast
bikes
are
going
all
the
time
besides
this
guy
didnt
speak
english
very
well
and
ended
up
absolutely
confounding
the
judge
the
cop
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
whod
been
recently
criminalized
by
some
twit
with
a
gun
and
a
quota
ahem
ok
im
better
now
maybe
hed
have
won
had
his
presentation
been
more
polished

not

ouch
this
brings
to
mind
one
of
the
recommendations
in

hurt
study
because
the
rear
of
the
gas
tank
is
in
close
proximity
to
highly
prized
and
easily
damaged
anatomy
hurt
et
al
recommended
that
manufacturers
build
the
tank
so
as
to
reduce
the
er
step
function
provided
when
the
riders
body
slides
off
of
the
seat
and
onto
the
gas
tank
in
the
unfortunate
event
that
the
bike
stops
suddenly
and
the
rider
doesnt
i
think
its
really
inspiring
how
the
manufacturers
have
taken
this
advice
to
heart
in
their
design
of
bikes
like
the
and
the
when
im
riding
my
my
goodies
are
already
up
against
the
tank
because
the
design
of
the
corbin
seat
tends
to
move
you
forward
wouldnt
the
major
danger
to
ones
cajones
be
due
to
accelerating
into
and
then
being
stopped
by
the
tank
if
youre
already
there
there
wouldnt

this

uk

a
few
others
have
vetoed
a

the
reason
is
that
such
a
limit
is
not
supported
by
accident
statistics
a
rare
example
of
governmental
wisdom
the
limit
has
a
five

moratorium
on
it

specialist

will
be
exempt

matter

drive

for

they
may
participate

theyre
probably
few

so
i
maintain
that
this
topic
is
of
interest
primarily
to
bikers
snow
skis

most
poeple
who
go

wear

do
most

motorcyclists
notice

picked

more
insignificant

two
parts

is
quite
rare

see
bikers
wear

face
with
either
nothing

says

do

nothing

riders

whatever
you

but
lets
make
some
attmept
to
stick
to
the
point
ive
been
out
on
the
road
where
i
had
to
stop
every
half
hour
to
clean
my
shield
there
were
so
many
bugs
and
my

would
be
a
bloodsplattered
mess
and
id
see
guys
with
shorty
helmets
no
goggles
long

and
tight

merrily
cruising

on

with
no

lets
be

specific

so
that

riding
jacket
recommendations
my
old
jacket
is
about
to
bite
the
dust
so
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
riding
jacket
im
looking
for
recommendations
for
a
suitable
replacement
i
would
like
to
buy
a
full
aerostich
suit
but
i
cant
afford
for
it
right
now
im
considering
two
basic
options
buy
the
aerostich
jacket
only
dunno
how
much
it
costs
due
to
recent
price
increases
but
id
imagine
over
that
may
be
pushing
my
limit
advantages
include
the
fact
that
i
can
later
add
the
pants
and
that
it
nearly
eliminates
the
need
for
the
jacket
portion
of
a
rainsuit
buy
some
kind
of
leather
jacket
i
like
a
few
of
the
new
heingericke
firstgear
line
however
they
may
be
a
bit
pricey
unless
i
can
work
some
sort
of
deal
advantages
of
leather
are
potentially
slightly
better
protection
enhanced
pose
value
we
all
know
how
important
that
is
possibly
cheaper
than
upper
aerostich
requirements
for
a
jacket
are
that
it
must
fit
over
a
few
other
layers
mainly
a
sizing
thing
if
leather
id
prefer
a
zipout
lining
it
must
have
some
body
armor
similar
to
aerostich
elbows
shoulders
forearms
possibly
backkidney
protection
etc
a
reasonable
amount
of
pocket
space
would
be
nice
ventilation
would
be
a
plus
however
it
must
be
wearable
in
cold
weather
below
freezing
with
layers
or
perhaps
electrics

away

crappy
honda
hi
i
just
have
a
small
question
about
my
bike
being
a
fairly
experienced
bmw
and
mzmechanic
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
about
my
honda
she
was
using
too
much
oil
for
the
last
km
on
my
trip
to
daytona
bike
week
this
spring
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
trailed
smoke
like
hell
and
was
running
only
on
one
cylinder
i
towed
the
bike
home
and
took
it
apart
but
everything
looks
in
perfect
working
order
no
cracks
in
the
heads
or
pistons
the
cylinder
walls
look
very
clean
and
the
wear
of
pistons
and
cylinders
is
not
measurable
all
still
within
factory
specs
the
only
thing
i
could
find
however
was
a
slightly
bigger
ring
gap
on
the
right
cylinder
the
one
with
the
problem
but
it
is
still
way
below
the
wearlimit
given
in
the
clymermanual
for
this
bike
any
syggestions
what
else
could
cause
my
problem
do
i
have
to
hone
the
cylinder
walls
make
them
a
little
rougher
in
a
crisscrosspattern
in
order
to
get
better
breaking
in
of
my
new
rings
wont
that
increase
the
wear
of
my
pistons
please
send

i
am
selling
my
trusty

hopefully
to
buy
a
husaberg
this
is
a
very
good
dirt
bike
and
has
been
maintained
perfectly
i
never
had
any
problems
with
it
its
a
four
stroke
valves
liquid
cooled
engine
it
is
heavier
than
a
stroke
but
still
lighter
than
a
honda
and
has
a
lot
better
suspension
ohlins
shock
husky
fork
than
the
xr
for
the
casual
or
non
competitive
rider
the
engine
is
much
better
than
any
two
stroke
you
can
easily
lug
up
hills
and
blast
through
trails
with
minimum
gear
changes
the
ignition
and
the
carefully
tuned
carburation
makes
this
bike
very
easy
to
start
starts

cold

is

thanks

advice
id
like
to
thank
everyone
who
took
the
time
to
respond
to
my
post
about
fighting
my
ticket
many
of
you
wrote
to
say
that
you
have
successfully
fought
and
won
your
case
in
court
others
lost
due
to
the
cop
outright
lying
to
the
judge
about
the
circumstances
surrounding
your
ticket
while
one
fellow
lost
because
the
judge
just
didnt
appear
to
be
in
the
mood
for
such
foolishness
several
of
you
suggested
that
i
obtain
a
book
called
fight
your
ticket
the
general
theme
from
those
who
said
go
for
it
was
to
be
prepared
i
should
do
as
much
research
as
possible
go
back
and
review
the
scene
transcribe
what
happened
to
tape
or
paper
use
any
witnesses
that
may
have
been
around
have
a
list
of
questions
to
ask
the
cop
andor
the
judge
and
to
be
positive
and
assertive
i
am
innocent
until
proven
guilty
gulp
a
few
people
suggested
trying
to
get
my
court
date
changed
as
this
might
trip
up
the
arresting
officer
he
may
not
show
up
if
the
date
is
on
his
day
off
or
if
he
feelsknows
that
he
doesnt
have
a
chance
to
win
against
you
one
individual
stated
that
an
officer
could
be
an
expert
witness
and
if
he
says
i
was
speeding
then
by
damn
i
was
speeding
another
says
that
i
must
have
been
paced
or
clocked
with
a
radar
gun
lots
of
good
suggestions
and
ideas
from
you
all
ill
let
you

happens

never

if

make

if

attempt
it
you
can
make

aware

you
by
at

getting
into

also

to
merging
into

after

do
it

what

observation
re

grf
dropped
my
shoei
off
the
seat
of
my
bike
while
trying
to
rock
it
onto
its
centerstand
chipped
the
heck
out
of
the
paint
on
it
so
i
cheerfully
spent
on
a
bottle
of
testors
model
paint
and
repainted
the
scratches
and
chips
for
minutes
then
while
it
was
drying
i
realized
that
i
was
out
of
smokes
and
that
my
cage
is
not
currently
running
so
i
had
to
take
my
bike
down
to
the
store
not
wanting
to
mess
up
my
paint
job
i
said
well
heck
i
can
just
use
my
old
helmet
this
is
your
standard
el
cheapie
openface
i
didnt
notice
a
big
difference
when
i
switched
to
the
shoei
but
switching
back
was
really
bad
doesnt
fit
worth
a
damn
too
wide
in
the
sides
too
short
front
to
back
with
a
faceplate
its
still
bloody
windy
with
the
shoei
i
normally
ignore
the
face
shield
until
i
get
up
to
about
with
this
one
taxiing
to
the
end
of
the
driveway
was
too
smegging

the
question
for
the
day
is
re
passenger
helmets
if
you
dont
know
for
certain
whos
gonna
ride
with
you
like
say
you
meet
them
at
a
church
meeting
yeah
thats
the
ticket
what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my
size
to
have
a
backup
helmet
xl
or
should
i
maybe
get
an
inexpensive
one

hello
all
on
my
bike
i
have
hazard
lights
both
front
and
back
turn
signals
flash
since
i
live
in
nj
and
commute
to
nyc
there
are
a
number
of
tolls
one
must
pay
on
route
just
before
arriving
at
a
toll
booth
i
switch
the
hazards
on
i
do
thisto
warn
other
motorists
that
i
will
be
taking
longer
than
the
seconds
to
make
the
transaction
taking
gloves
off
getting
money
out
of
coin
changerpocket
making
transaction
putting
gloves
back
on
takes
a
little
more
time
than
the
average
cager
takes
to
make
the
same
transaction
of
paying
the
toll
i
also
notice
that
when
i
do
this
cagers
tend
to
get
the
message
and
usually
go
to
another
booth
my
question
is
this
a
goodbad
thing
to
do
any
others
tend
to
do
the
same
just
curious

watch
out
often
when
some
scumbag
steals
the
cover
that
means
that
they
were
or
are
looking
to
steal
the
bike
in
my
case
i
had
a
faded
cover
stolen
off
a
bmw
that
was
stashed
in
an
apartment
carport
and
not
visible
from
the
street
they
evidently
decided
the
beemer
wasnt
worth
stealing
but
did
try
the
next
night
to
steal
a
honda
hurricane
parked
in
the
next
apartment
building
a
neighbor
heard
them
wheeling
it
out
and
called
the
cops
i
know
this
is
just
setting
myself
up
but
this
is
actually
one
of
the
things
that
is
really
good
about
bmw
bikes
from
all
accounts
ive
heard
practically
no
one
steals
bmws
probably
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzis
and
other
relative
exotics
since
there
isnt
a
large
demand
for
parts
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seems
that
the
most
stolen
bikes
are
harleys

yo
did
anybody
see
this
run
of
hard
copy
i
guy
on
a
katana
got
pulled
over
by
the
police
i
guess
for
speeding
or
something
but
just
as
the
cop
was
about
to
step
out
of
the
car
the
dude
punches
it
down
an
interstate
in
georgia
ang
then
the
cop
gives
chase
now
this
was
an
interesting
episode
because
it
was
all
videotaped
everything
from
the
dramatic
takeoff
and
chase
to
the
sidestreet
battle
at
about
what
happened
at
the
end
the
guy
who
is
being
relentless
chased
down
box
the
cage
with
the
disco
lights
slows
a
couple
of
times
to
taunt
the
cop
after
blowing
a
few
stop
signs
and
making
car
jump
to
the
side
he
goes
up
a
dead

the
kat
although
not
the
latest
machine
is
still
a
high
performance
machine
and
he
slams
on
the

we
all
know
that
cages
especially
the
ones
with
the
disco
lights
cant
stop
as
fast
as
our
high
performance
machines
so
what
happens
the
cage
plows
into
the
kat
luckily
for
this
dude
he
was
wearing
a
helmet
and
was
not
hurt
but
dude
how
crazy
can
you
get
yeah
weve
all
went
out

played

with

how

it
took
just

look
at

tried

to

collided

still
looked

silver
headed

a

the

is

about

purchased
a

heated
up
water
from
a
source
it
was
for
car
use
but
we
thought
wed
try
it
on
my
it
worked
ok
apart
from
one
slight
problem
we
had
to
keep
the
revs
above
any
lower
and
the
motor
would
die
from
lack
of
electron
movement
it
made
for
interesting
cups
of
coffee
anyhow
we
would
plot
routes
that
contained
straights
of
over
three
miles
so
that
we
had
sufficient
time
to
get
the
water
to
boiling

this
is
sometimes

traffic

their

everybodys
got

is

are
right

acurate
information
is
extremely
difficult

come
by

dmv
doesnt

dont
know
your
traffic
school
instructor
doesnt
know
the
vehicle
code
only
tells
part
of
the
story
judges
choose
to
interpret
the
laws
in
a
wide
variety
of
ways
and
the
public
at
large
i
seldom
hear
any
advice
that
doesnt
disagree
with
something
ive
experienced
if
you
dont
believe
me
i
suggest
you
get
a
copy
of
the
vehicle
code
study
it
and
then
sit
in
on
a
day
or
two
of
court
and
see
what
really
happens
read
fight
your
ticket
too
but
dont
miss
the
little
section
at
the
end
where
it
says
your
chances
are
lousy
and
youre
basically
screwed
as
you
may
have
guessed
im
pretty
down
on
the
system
here
in
california
ive
carefully
prepared
for
court
bringing
witnesses
and
revealing
serious
holes
in
the
officers
story
only
to
be
slapped
with
the
maximum
allowable
fine
plus
assessments
of
over
the
message
clear
that
the
judge
does
not
appreciate
john
q
public
trying
his
own
cases
so
heres
my
advice
when
you
find
yourself
with
a
ticket
take
traffic
school
if
you
can
if
its
a
serious
matter
get
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
can
present
the
exact
same
case
as
you
the
difference
is
the
sentence

if
we
are
only
talking
about
i
think
i
can
understand
exhaust
pulse
affect
in
a
the
intake
valve
is
closed
on
the
exhaust
stroke
and
the
gas
is
pushed
out
by
the
cyclinder
i
guess
there
is
some
gas
compression
that
may
affect
the
amount
pushed
out
but
the
limiting
factor
seems
to
be
the
header
pipe
and
not
the
canister
meaning
would
gases
so
far
down
the
line
the
canister
really
have
an
effect
on
the
exhaust
stroke
do
the
gases
really
compress
that
much
for
discussion
purposes
i
will
ignore
dynamic
effects
like
pulses
in
the
exhaust
pipe
and
try
to
paint
a
useful
mental
picture
unless
an
engine
is
supercharged
the
pressure
available
to
force
air
into
the
intake
tract
is
atmospheric
at
the
time
the
intake
valve
is
opened
the
pressure
differential
available
to
move
air
is
only
the
difference
between
the
combustion
chamber
pressure
left
over
after
the
exhaust
stroke
and
atmospheric
as
the
piston
decends
on
the
intake
stroke
combustion
chamber
pressure
is
decreased
allowing
atmospheric
pressure
to
move
more
air
into
the
intake
tract
at
no
time
does
the
pressure
ever
become
negative
or
even
approach
a
good
vacuum
at
the
time
of
the
exhaust
valve
closing
the
pressure
in
the
combustion
chamber
is
essentially
the
pressure
of
the
exhaust
system
up
to
the
first
major
flow
restriction
the
muffler
note
that
the
volume
of
gas
that
must
flow
through
the
exhaust
is
much
larger
than
the
volume
that
must
flow
through
the
intake
because
of
the
temperature
difference
and
the
products
of
combustion
in
the
last
years
the
japanese
manufacturers
have
started
paying
attention
to
exhaust
and
intake
tuning
in
pursuit
of
almighty
horsepower
at
this
point
in
time
on
highperformance
bikes
substitution
of
an
aftermarket
freeflow
air
filter
will
have
almost
zero
affect
on
performance
because
the
stock
intake
system
flows
very
well
anyway
substitution
of
an
aftermarket
exhaust
system
will
make
very
little
difference
unless
in
general
the
new
exhaust
system
is
much
louder
than
the
stocker
on
older
bikes
exhaust
backpressure
was
the
dominating
factor
if
freeflowing
air
filters
were
substituted
very
little
difference
was
noted
unless
a
freeflowing
exhaust
system
was
installed
as
well
in
general
an
engine
can
be
visualized
as
an
air
pump
at
any
given
rpm
anything
that
will
cause
the
engine
to
pump
more
air
be
it
on
the
intake
or
exhaust
side
will
cause
it
to
produce
more
horsepower
pumping
more
air
will
require
recalibration

re
drinking
and
riding
personally
i
follow
the
no
alcohol
rule
when
im
on
a
bike
my
view
is
that
you
have
to
be
in
such
a
high
degree
of
control
that
any
alcohol
could
be
potentially
hazardous
to
my
bike
if
i
get
hurt
its
my
own
fault
but
i
dont
want
to
wreck
my
katana
i
developed
this
philosophy
from
an
impromptu
experiment
i
had
one
beer
at
in
the
evening
and
had
volleyball
practice
at
i
wasnt
even
close
to
leagle
intoxication
but
i
couldnt
perform
even
the
most
basic
things
until
this
made
me
think
about
how
i
viewed
alcohol
and
intoxication
you
may

may

affected
such
that
youll

that

this
sound

the
nice
thing
about
horses
though
is
that
if
they
break
down
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
you
can
eat
them
and
theyre
rather
tasty
fuels
a
bit
cheaper
too
per
gallon
bushel
perhaps
unfortunately
they
eat
the
same
amount
every
day
no
matter
how
much
you
ride
them
and
if
you
dont
fuel
them
they
die
on
an
annual
basis

airhorns
on
an
review
for
those
of
you
who
are
thinking
about
fiamms
you
might
also
want
to
think
about
airhorns
i
just
installed
a
set
of
bosch
air
horns
ordered
from
dennis
kirk
pg
of
the
latest
catalog
on
my
they
are
rated
at
at
meters
i
installed
them
using
gage
wire
from
the
battery
to
the
relay
to
the
compressor
to
ground
my
stock
horn
connectors
fit
the
relay
pins
just
fine
i
soldered
the
connections
to
the
relay
and
compressor
and
used
a
crimp
type
battery
connector
and
an
inline
fuseconnector
from
napa
i
installed
the
compressor
just
forward
of
the
fuse
box
in
the
front
fairing
by
tie
wrapping
between
the
steering
head
frame
and
the
black
steel
tube
frame
used
to
support
the
front
fairing
you
have
to
remove
the
front
fairing
to
do
this
but
it
fits
outside
of
the
frame
but
inside
the
fairing
on
the
two
vertical
supports
just
in
front
of
the
fuses
depending
how
tight
your
fairing
follows
the
frame
you
should
be
able
to
fit
it
somewhere
in
the
fairing
the
compressor
is
about
in
diameter
and
about
long
the
relay
mounted
on
the
front
of
the
steering
head
frame
it
is
small
so
there
should
be
plenty
of
good
places
for
it
i
found
a
perfect
place
for
the
horns
that
required
only
tie
wraps
to
mount
the
horns
fit
inside
the
front
fairingframe
and
stick
out
on
either
side
just
in
front
of
the
air
scoops
but
behind
the
turn
signals
the
back
of
the
horns
point
back
towards
the
center
of
the
bike
and
come
real
close
to
where
the
gas
tank
connects
to
the
front
part
of
the
frame
there
is
just
enough
room
to
the
outside
to
allow
full
lock
to
lock
clearance
and
there
are
nice
cut
outs
in
the
frame
for
the
back
of
the
horn
to
go
into
the
short
horn
is
even
with
the
fairing
and
the
long
one
sticks
out
about
an
inch
or
so
but
it
is
really
not
that
noticable
unless
you
look
closely
they
end
up
pointing
down
slightly
and
maybe
degrees
from
straight
ahead
perfect
for
those
cagers
trying
to
change
lanes
into
you
if
you
have
any
other
questions
about
the
mounting
email

i
can
try
to
explain
better
if
your
bike
is
not
red
then
you
may
want
to
paint
them
first
how
do
they
work
you
ask
they
are
very
very
very
loud
they
sound
more
like
a
european
sports
car
than
a
truck
but
a
vast
improvement
over
stock
i
have
used
them
at
least
daily
since
installing
them
and
the
amp
fuse
has
not
blown
yet
although
the
duration
of
the

blasts
have
been
short
ive
repeatedly
scared
the
shit
out
of
my
friends
with
them
even
though
they
know
that
i

the
horns
they
still

are

we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explanations
for
why
one
can
use
the
handlebars
to
lean
a
moving
motorcycle
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
dominant
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experiment
which
would
seaprate
the
two
characteristics
and
see
which
effect
produces
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
us
who
have
bikes
are
familiar
as
you
point
out
the
experiments
would
be
difficult
but
we
know
enough
about
the
physics
of
the
situation
to
do
some
calculations
there
are
in
fact
three
effects
contributing
to
leaning
the
bike
over
to
begin
a
turn
gyro
effect
causing
a
torque
which
twists
the
bike
over
contact
patch
having
shifted
to
one
side
causing
bike
to
fall
over
contact
patch
being
accelerated
to
the
side
causing
a
torque
which
twists
the
bike
over
take
an
average
bikerider
average
bike
wheel
and
at
speeds
of
and
mph
say
calculate
how
much
twist
of
the
bars
would
be
needed
to
produce
say
degrees
of
lean
in
say
seconds
by
each
effect
alone
my
guess
is
that
at
slow
speeds
is
dominant
and
at
high
speeds
is
dominant
and
at
all
speeds
contributes
not
far
off
bugger
all
relatively
speaking
by
the
way
a
similar
problem
is
this
how
does
a
runner
who
wants
to
run
round
a
corner
get
leaned
into
the
corner
fast
is
there
a
running
group
where
we
could
start
counterfooting
arguments
and
have
them
all
falling

hate

there

its
the

just
another

adversary
so
remember
to
wear
at

calf

leather
boots
in

the
dog
gets
lucky
and
sinks
his
teeth
into
your

go

gusto
if
that
dog
doesnt
retreat
from

a
hotly
contested
bmwoa
election
and
some
inept
leadership
my
question
is
the
history
of
the
bmw
organization
that
lead
to
the
formation
of
the
bmwra
was
there
something
going
on
in
the
oa
years
ago
that
precipitated
the
formation
of
two
competing
owners
groups
just
to
stave
off
flames
im
a
relatively
new
member
of
both
groups
and
besides
a
difference
in
the
slickness
of
the
magazines
it
seems
the
major
difference
is
that
the

guys
seem
to
have

dogs
im
a
biker
and
a
doglover
first
and
foremost
i
want
to
mention
some
common
sense
if
its
a
choice
between
injuringkilling
a
dog
or
getting
yourself
injuredkilled
there
is
only
one
rational
decision
only
the
most
insane
animal
rights
kook
would
put
the
dog
first
second
its
useful
to
learn
how
to
read
a
dogs
body
language
how
you
react
to
a
dog
who
is
chasing
you
because
he
thinks
its
a
game
and
that
youre
playing
with
him
is
completely
different
from
how
you
react
to
a
dog
which
has
hostile
intent
third
its
useful
to
learn
how
to
present
yourself
to
a
dog
dogs
are
social
beasts
and
recognize
a
dominationsubmission
hierarchy
to
a
dog
there
are
two
types
of
fellowcreatures
that
which
he
dominates
and
that
which
dominate
him
you
need
to
unambiguously
represent
yourself
as
being
of
the
latter
class
you
are
god
you
are
easily
angered
and
your
anger
is
terrible
but
god
is
also
amused
by
one
who
properly
submits
to
his
dominance
and
may
even
on
rare
occasions
dispense
a
kind
word
a
kind
word
or
even
oh
joy
oh
rapture
unforeseen
a
dog
bisquit
now
how
does
that
all
relate
to
biking
well
first
its
a
good
idea
to
assume
that
most
dogs
who
chase
motorcycles
do
so
because
they
think
its
a
game
and
not
out
of
overt
hostility
the
msf
suggestion
is
a
very
good
one
when
you
see
the
dog
coming
slow
down
so
he
determines
a
particular
place
of
interception
just
before
you
and
he
reach
that
spot
punch
the
throttle
so
that
when
he
reaches
it
youre
already
long
gone
dogs
take
a
few
seconds
to
react
to
new
input
and
definitely
cannot
comprehend
the
acceleration
that
a
motorcycle
is
capable
of
with
a
hostile
dog
or
one
which
you
repeatedly
encounter
stronger
measures
may
be
necessary
this
is
the
face
off
first
and
there
is
very
important
make
sure
you
never
face
off
a
dog
on
his
territory
face
him
off
on
the
road
not
on
his
driveway
if
necessary
have
a
large
stick
rolled
up
newspaper
etc
something
the
beast
will
understand
is
something
that
will
hurt
him
stand
your
ground
then
slowly
advance
your
mental
attitude
is
that
you
are
very
angry
and
are
going
to
dispense
terrible
punishment
the
larger
the
dog
the
greater
your
anger
dogs
will
pick
up
anger
just
as
they
can
pick
up
fear
and
since
you
and
he
are
not
on
his
home
territory
it
may
suddenly
dawn
on
the
dog
that
perhaps
he
is
on
your
territory
and
that
you
are
prepared
to
fight
to
the
death
most
dogs
will
decide
that
it
is
a
good
idea
to
retreat
to
their
own
territory
where
there
is
at
least
a
home
advantage
theyll
also
observe
that
you
are
satisfied
by
that
retreat
gesture
of
submission
and
thus
they
have
escaped
punishment
the
interesting
thing
about
dogs
is
that
body
language
communicates
a
great
deal
to
them
the
more
effective
you
are
at
communicating

insurance
companies
sure
seem
to
go
for
nofault
coverage
since
the
majority
of
accidents
are
the
cagers
fault
doesnt
this
imply
that
we
would
have
to
pay
much
higher
rates
under
a
nofault
system
with
a
carsonly
system
it
seems
to
make
sense
on
the
surface
take
the
legal
costs
out
of
the
system
but
it
looks
like
motorcyclists
would
get
screwed
yup
unfortunately
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
cost
of
insurance
does
not
go
down
with
no
fault
the
crappiest
drivers
make
out
like
bandits
because
they
no
longer
have
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
paying
for
insurance
that
they
have
boosted
in
price
for
themselves
by
being
crappy
drivers
the
good
drivers
now
pay
through
the
nose
to
spread
the
cost
of
the
crappy
drivers
actions
and
thats
not
fair
any
plan
that
caps
rates
for
crappy
drivers
is
inherently
a
piece
of
shit
because
the
rest
of
us
end
up
paying
more
any
plan
that
uses
speeding
tickets
as
a
basis
for
raising
rates
is
also
a
piece
of
shit
as
it
is
based
upon
the
lie
that
faster
drivers
are
inherently
less
safe
than
slower
drivers
and
the
nhtsa
disproved

i
have

it
dont

stupid
as
to
leave
your
helmet
on

where
it

fall

go

that
kind
of
fall
is
what
the

is
designed
to
protect
against
if
you
fall
with
the
helmet
on
and
you
hit
the

spot
the
helmet
landed
on
during

the
helmet
may
not
protect
your

as
well
as
it
was
intended
to
do
conservative
recmotoers
will
recommend
that
you
replace
the
helmet
if
you
want
to
be
sure
that
it
will
protect
you
adequately
you
should
helmets
go
on
the
ground
on
a
table
on
a
chair
on
a
shelf
or
on

that
is

splitfire

kinda
offical
yo
whaz
up
earlier
i

about
using
splitfire
plugs
one
guy
was
thinking
about
it
and
almost
everybody
shot
him
to
hell
well
i
saw
one
think
that
someone
said
about
show
me
a
team
that
used
split
fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
increased
performance
by
increasing
torque
they
werent
focusing
on
horsepower
numbers
now
how
does
this
related
to
us
high
performance
pilots
well
that
depends
do
you
pilot
a
high
performance
or
machine
in
the
case
of
splitfires
would
increase
overall
torque
but
make
more
top
end
horsepower
with
its
torque
packed
down
low
so
for
splitfires
would
not
significantly
increase
power
but
what
about
twins
many
of
you
guys
laugh
at
some
of
us
twins
but
many
times
we
carry
less
weight
which
sometimes
can
make
up
for
the
hp
loss
see
doug
polen
vs
scott
russell
daytona
however
twins
make
more
torque
thoughout
their
powerbands
so
how
does
this
translate
increased
torque
should
theoretically
help
twins
make
more
power
splitfire
claims
that
there
should
be
not
extra
mods

anything

say
you
meet

at

yeah
thats
the
ticket
what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my

to
have
a
backup
helmet
xl

should
i
maybe
get
an
inexpensive
one
of
a

my

you

actually
if

physical
type
in

when
you
go
to
these
cough
church
meetings
if
your
tastes
tend
to
smaller
more
petite
cough
churchgoers
it
is
more
likely
that
they
will
have
a
smaller
head
and
you
can
safely
get
a
medium
or
small
helmet
this
works
for
me
and
i
traded
my
spare
large
helmet
with
my
best
friend
who
at
tends
to
look
more
for
women
that
are
over
and
cant
usually
fit
into
the
medium
size
helmet
he
previously
had
of
course
if
you
arent
picky
what
size
cough
churchgoers
you
give
helpful
motorcycle
rides
to
then
eds
advice
will
hopefully
cover
any
eventuality
as
far
as
legality
is
concerned
and
a
spare
handtowel
in
the
tankbag
makes
acceptable
padding
so
the
passenger
can
see
out
of
the
viewport
rather
than
the
padding
above
the
viewport
in
the
cases
of
extreme
mismatch

why

it

im
going

to
put
a

of
bikes
in

several

from

im
already
contemplating
how
to
do
it
so
theyre
as
easy
to
get
going
again
as
possible
i
have
everything
under
control
i
think
besides
the
batteries
i
know
that
if
i
buy
a
battery
tender
for
each
one
and
leave
them
plugged
in
the
whole
time
the
bikes
are
in
storage
theyll
be
fine
but
im
not
sure
thats
necessary
ive
never
heard
anyone
discussing
this
idea
so
maybe
theres
some
reason
why
it
isnt
so
great
but
maybe
someone
can
tell
me
would
it
be
a
mistake
to
fully
charge
the
batteries
drain
the
electrolyte
into
separate
containers
one
for
each
battery
seal
the
container
close
up
the
batteries
and
leave
them
that
way
then
it
would
seem
that
when
the
bikes
come
out
of
storage
i
could
put
the
electrolyte
back
in
the
batteries
and
they
should
still
be
fully
charged

this

bollocks
you

its
natural

sorry

im
not

kick
over

can
you
not
countersteer

that
ones
been
kicked
around
enough
for
the

ill
concede
that
its
countersteering
sake
of
argument
only
mjsmsf
did
not
teach
you
how
to
countersteer
it
only
told
you
what
mjsyou
were
already
doing
and
theres
no
value
in
that
i
didnt
say
there
was
no
value
all
i
said
was
that
it
is
very
confusing
to
newbies
theres
a
big
difference
in
knowing
whats
happening
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
especially
in
the
extreme
case
of
an
emergency
swerve
and
just
letting
the
bike
do
whatever
it
does
to
make
itself
turn
once
i
knew
precisely
what
was
happening
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
abruptly
and
on
command
my
emergency
avoidance
abilities
improved
tenfold
not
to
mention
a
big
improvement
in
my
normal
cornering
ability
i
am
much
more
proficient
knowing
how
to
countersteer
the
motorcycle
rather
than
letting
the
motorcycle
steer
itself
that
is
when
i
remember
to
take
cognitive
command
of
the
bike
rather
than
letting
it
run
itself
through
the
corners
whereupon
i
return
to
my
original
comment
better
to
learn
whats
happening
right
from
the
start
and
how
to
take
charge
of
it
rather
than
developing
the
bad
habit
of
merely
going
along
for
the
ride
bill
you
are
kidding
yourself
here
firstly
motorcycles
do
not
steer
themselves
only
the
rider
can
do
that
secondly
it
is
the
adhesion
of
the
tyre
on
the
road
the
suspension
geometry
and
the
ground
clearance
of
the
motorcycle
which
dictate
how
quickly
you
can
swerve
to
avoid
obstacles
and
not
the
knowledge
of
physics
between
the
riders
ears
are
you
seriously
suggesting
that
countersteering
knowledge
enables
you
to
corner
faster
or
more
competently
than
you
could
manage
otherwise
mike
im
extremely
gratified
for
you
that
you
have
such
a
natural
affinity
and
prowess
for
motorcycling
that
formal
training
was
a
total
waste
of
time
for
you
assuming
your
total
training
hasnt
come
from
simply
from
reading
recmotorcycles
however
of
the
motorcyclists
ive
discussed
formal
rider
education
with
have
regarded
the
experience
as
overwhelmingly
positive
this
regardless
of
the
amount
of
experience
they
brought
into
the
course
ranging
from
minutes
to
years
formal
training
in
this
country
as
far
as
i
am
aware
does
not
include
countersteering
theory
i
found
out
about
countersteering
about
six
years
ago
from
a
physics
lecturer
who
was
also
a
motorcyclist
i
didnt
believe
him
at
first
when
he
said
i
steered
my
bike
to
the
right
to
make
it
turn
left
but
i
went
out
and
analysed
closely
what
i
was
doing
and
realized
he
was
right
its
an
interesting
bit
of
knowledge
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
fun
since
then
telling
others
about
it
who
were
at
first
as
sceptical
as
i
was
but
thats
all
it
is
an
interesting
bit
of
knowledge
and
to
claim
that
it
is
essential
for
all
bikers
to
know
it
or
that
you
can
corner
faster
or
better
as
a
result
is
absurd
formal
training
is
in
my
view
absolutely
essential
if
youre
going
to
be
able
to
ride
a
bike
properly
and
safely
but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for
them
to
learn
and
that
was
my

it
looks

the

also
gives

my

is
whether
the

have

for

to

i
dont

all

used
a

quart
in

this
soon
quits
and
by
the
time
i
had

on

the

was
about
zero
ive
been
told
that
the
harder
you
run
the

within

the
sooner
it
stops
using

is
unnecessarily

thing
i
know
exactly
whats
happening
its
those
other
gits
that
havent
a
clue
me
too
understanding
the
physics
of
traction
is
fine
but
i
cannot
see
how
detailed
theory
like
that
has
any
place
in
a
motorcyle
training
course
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
maximum
traction
is
obtained
with
the
tyre
just
beginning
to
slide
against
the
road
then
we
are
in
violent
disagreement
while
what
you
state
is
true
it
is
insufficient
to
form
a
traction
management
policy
available
traction
increases
with
applied
normal
force
ie
traction
available
to
the
front
wheel
increases
as
weight
shifts
under
braking
forces
and
correspondingly
decreases
at
the
rear
thus
a
technique
of
applying
both
brakes
and
easing
off
the
rear
and
increasing
pressure
on
the
front
can
best
be
learned
with
an
understanding
of
weight
shift
and
available
traction
jeez
ed
when
you
started
talking
about
traction
management
policies
i
thought
you
were
making
some
weird
reference
to
looking
after
railway
locomotives
the
official
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubts
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
applied
first
followed
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
being
that
you
avoid
locking
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
takes
place
in
practice
i
suspect
most
people
do
what
you
describe
saying
brake
until
the
tire
just
begins
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advice
to
a
newbie
he
has
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
gives
him
zero
information
from
which
to
develop
a
braking
technique
that
changes
as
the
braking
and
corresponding
weight
shift
develop
if
you

you
have
no

of
knowing
whether
youve
achieved
maximum
braking
or
not
im
not
suggesting
that
you
should
always
aim
to
brake
as
hard
as
you
possibly
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limits
of
the
machine
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
in
any

for
maximum
braking
if
as
i
suggested
you
aim

keep
both

just

youll

what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
it
depends
on
the
bike
once
youve
found
a
bike
youre
interested
in
call
some
insurance
companies
for
rates
some
bikes
are
much
cheaper
to
insure
than
you
might
think
my
only
costs
me
in
st
louis
im
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
for
a
first
bike
i
recommend
or
less
and
a
bike
short
enough
to
get
both
feet
on
the
ground
when
you
stop
the
one
piece
of
advice
everyone
will
give
you
is
to
take
a
motorcycle
safety
foundation
riders
course
see
a
dealer
for
details
in
some
states
completion
of
such
a
course
can
give
you
a
break
on
insurance
it
will
also
teach
you
to
ride
properly
from
the
beginning
so
you
wont
learn
any
bad
habits
good
luck
riding
a
motorcycle
is
the
most
fun
you
can

pissed
off
with
cops
pulling
over
speeders
in
dangerous
spots

often
blind
corners
that
one
day
he
decided
to
get
revenge
cruising
on

test

he
noticed
a
cop
had
pulled
over

on
an
on
or
off
ramp
with
almost
no
shoulder
being
a
bright
lad
he
hit
his
bikes
kill

just
before
passing
the
cop
who
happened
to
be
bending
towards
the
offending
motorist
thereby
exposing
his
glutes
to
the
passing
world
with
his
ignition
system
now
dead
he
pumped
his
throtle
two
or
three
times
to
fill
his
exhaust
canisters
with
volatile
raw
fuel
all
it
took
was
a
stab
at
the
kill
switch
to
relight
the
ignition
and
send
a
flame
in
sargeant
swells
direction
i
wonder
if
any
cycle
cops
read
cycle

although
i
agree
with
the
spirit
of
the
action
i
do
hope
that
the
rider
ponied
up
the
or
so
it
takes
to
replace
the
exhaust
system
he
just
destroyed
the
owners
manual
explicitly
warns
against

note
this

about

times
a
few
times
a

a
funny
thing
happens
the
bike
engine
runs
perfectly
completely
smooth
not
that
it
runs
poorly
normally
but
on
these
days
it
is
exceptional
my
theory
is
that
the
air
density
and
moisture
content
of
the
air
are
such
that
i
get
complete
combustion
needless
to
say
it
puts
me
in
a
great
mood
the
mood
lasted
for
about
miles
heading
north
on
the
freeway
about
a
mile
or
two
south
of
the
my
throttle
stopped
responding
and
i
was
between
lanes
nothing

do
but
make
my
way
over
lanes
to
the
shoulder
initially
by
gliding
then
by
pushing
at

traffic
was
heavy
enough
so
that
cars
did
not
mind
stopping
for
me
turned
out
to
be

i
keep
hearing
that
one
should
keep
all
of

screws
tight
on
a

but
i
never
thought
that
i
had
to
do
that
on
the
screws
inside
of
a

at

it
was
roadside
fixable
and
i
was

if

up

it
in

near

would
i
do
better
to
wear

totally
nondamaged

which
doesnt
fit

keep
out

as
well
or
wearing
the
shoei
which
is
a
lot
more
comfortable
keeps
the
wind
out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damage
wear
the
even
after
a
few
drops
paint
chips
it
is
far
better
than
no
helmet
or
a
poorly
fitting
one
ive
had
many
scratches
bangs
which
have
been
repaired
plus
im
still
confident
of
the
protection
the
helmet
will
continue
to
give
me
only
when
you
actually
see
depressions
or
actual
cracks
using
a
magnifying
glass
should
you
consider
replacement
this
is
not
good
advice
a
couple
of
years
i
was
involved
in
a
lowspeed
getoff
in
which
i
landed
on
my
back
on
the
pavement
my
head
helmeted
hit
the
pavement
with
a
clunk
leaving
a
couple
of
dings
and
chips
in
the
paint
at
the
point
of
impact
but
no
other
visible
damage
i
called
the
helmet
manufacturer
and
inquired
about
damage
they
said
that
the
way
a
fiberglass
shell
works
is
to
first
give
then
delaminate
then
crack
this
is
the
way
fiberglass
serves
to
spread
the
force
of
the
impact
over
a
wider
area
after
the
fiberglass
has
done
its
thing
the
crushable
foam
liner
takes
care
of
absorbing
hopefully
the
remaining
impact
force
they
told
me
that
the
second
stage
of
fiberglass
functionality
delamination
of
the
glassresin
layers
can
occur
with
no
visible
signs
either
inside
or
outside
of
the
helmet
they
suggested
that
i
send
them
the
helmet
and
they
would
inspect
it
including
xraying
i
did
so
they
sent
back
the
helmet
with
a
letter
stating
that
that
they
could
find
no
damage
that
would
compromise
the
ability
of
the
helmet
to
provide
maximum
protection
i
suspect
that
this
letter
would
eliminate
their
being
able
to
claim
prior
damage
to
the
helmet
in
the
event
i
were
to
sue
them
the
bottom
line
though
is
that
it
appears
that
a
helmets
integrity
can
be
compromised
with
no
visible
signs
the
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
send
it
back
and
have
it
inspected
note
that
some
helmet
manufacturers
provide
inspections
services
and
some
do
not
another

consider

several

a

darted
out
at

intersection
right
in
front
of
me
but
there
was
enough
distance
between
us
so
i
didnt
have
to
slow
down
however
a
dog
suddenly
appeared
and
collided
with
my
right
front
bumper
and
the
force
of
the
impact
was
enough
to
kill
that
scottish
terrier
apparently
it
was
following
the
dog
henceforth
if
a
dog
decides
to
cross
the
street
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
dog
as
many
dogs
like
to
travel
in
pairs

wouldnt

to
running

ive

shopping
for
her
first
motorcycle
this
is
great
unfortunately
she
needs
at
most
a
seat
this
is
not
great
so
far
the
only
thing
weve
found
was
an
old
and
unhappylooking
so
its
time
to
tap
the
collective
memory
of
all
the
denizens
out
there
anybody
know
of
models
old
models
and
used
bikes
are
not
a
problem
with
a
or
lower
seat
and
since
she
has
to
make
this
difficult
she
would
prefer
not
to
end
up
with
a

theres

when

it
wouldnt
idle
at

it

idle
i
am

the

are
messed
up
i
checked
the
timing
it
was
fine
so
i
advanced
it
a
little
and
that
didnt
help
i
assume
the
carbs
need
to
be
synched
can
i
buy
a
kit
and
do
this
myself
if
so
what
kit
is
the
best
for
the

any
other
suggestions
i
dont

its
the

are

i
would

new
to
motorcycles
hello
everyone
im
new
to
motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
in
dc
as
i
imagine
it
is
in
every
other
state
ok
ok
were
not
a
state
were
not
bitter
you
take
the
written
test
first
and
then
get
a
learners
permit
however
im
wondering
how
one
goes
about
learning
to
ride
the
bike
proficiently
enough
so
as
to
a
get
a
liscence
and
b
not
kill
oneself
i
dont
know
anyone
with
a
bike
who
could
teach
me
and
the
most
advice
ive
heard
is
either
do
you
live
near
a
field
or
do
you
have
a
friend
with
a
pickup
truck
the
answers
to
both
of
which
are
no
do
i
just
ride
around
my
neighborhood
and
hope
for
the
best
i
kind
of
live
in
a
residential
area
but
its
not
suburbs
its
still
the
big
city
and
im
about
a
mile
from
downtown
so
that
doesnt
seem
too
viable
any
stories
on
how
you
all
learned

formal
training
is
in
my
view
absolutely
essential
if
youre
going
to
be
able
to
ride
a
bike
properly
and
safely
but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for
them
to
learn
and
that
was
my
original
point
mike
while
i
agree
with
you
on
that
formal
training
is
essential
for
safe
riding
i
disagree
strongly
with
your
original
point
the
point
of
formal
training
must
be
to
prepare
riders
for
the
road
preparedness
is
in
my
opinion
to
know
as
much
as
possible
so
to
exclude
some
aspects
of
riding
a
bike
in
a
course
is
wrong
imho
now
to
countersteering
in
particular
countersteering
is
something
that
must
be
trained
a
common
reaction
among
new
bikers
or
bicycle
riders
in
an
emergency
situation
is
to
steer
the
motorcycle
like
a
bicycle
as
we
know
this
makes
the
motorcycle
go
in
the
direction
opposite
to
what
was
intended
needless
to
say
this
is
dangerous
i
have
a
specific
example
a
rider
in
a
left
turn
the
rider
thinks
heshe
is
to
close
to
the
right
shoulder
of
the
road
and
tries
to
steer
the
motorcycle
to
the
left
by
pulling
the
left
handle
and
pushing
the
right
handle
the
motorcycle
straightens
up
and
goes
off
the
road
a
worse
scenario
the
same
rider
same
turn
in
the
middle
of
the
turn
the
rider
sees
a
truck
coming
towards
himher
the
panicking
rider
tries
to
steer
the
motorcycle
away
from
the
truck
and
crashes
right
into
it
the
main
function
of
a
riding
course
is
to
teach
how
to
avoid
emergency
situations
and
what
to
do
if
in
one
thus
the
knowledge
and
training
of
countersteering
is
imho
a
must
in
any
riding
course

the
best
lock
ive
found
for
bikes
is
the
cobra
lock
its
a
cable
which
is
shrouded
by
an
articulated
hardened
steel
sleeve
the
lock
itself
is
cylindrical
and
the
locking
pawl
engages
the
joints
at
the
articulation
points
so
the
chain
can
be
adjusted
like
handcuffs
you
cant
get
any
leverage
on
the
lock
to
break
it
open
and
the

is

i

hello
everyone
im
new
to
motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
any
stories
on
how
you
all
learned
ill
tell
you
my
story
as
an
example
of
what
not
to
do
early
in
i
took
some
riding
lessons
from
my
college
roommate
on
his
old
honda
he
had
taken
the
msf
beginners
course
so
i
actually
learned
some
of
what
i
needed
to
know
to
ride
i
proceeded
to
buy
a
beatup
honda
for
and
a
helmet
and
rode
around
wearing
this
and
a
cotton
windbreaker
then
i
decided
to
invest
in
a
fullface
helmet
first
smart
move
sometime
around
then
i
also
passed
my
road
test
on
may
i
got
caught
in
a
rainstorm
on
my
way
home
from
a
trip
entering
the
town
where
i
lived
a
rather
urban
suburb
i
had
to
stop
suddenly
for
a
red
light
that
i
noticed
too
late
skidded
the
rear
tire
out
and
was
ejected
face
upward
into
the
oncoming
lane
of
traffic
fortunately
for
me
the
oncoming
traffic
was
also
stopped
for
the
same
red
light
otherwise
i
might
have
slid
under
a
car
and
been
killed
now
this
is
anecdotal
evidence
to
be
sure
but
i
later
took
the
experienced
rider
course
from
the
msf
and
saw
that
earlier
training
could
have
helped
me
greatly
in
your
case
the
need
is
even
greater
since
you
have
nobody
to
help
you
practice
even
the
most
basic
stuff
as
i
did
so
my
advice
is
to
take
the
msf
beginners
course
first
thing
i
wouldnt
even
buy
a
bike
until
youve
taken
the
course
unless
you
happen
to
pick
up
a
real
good
deal
and
can
store
it
someplace
until
youre
ready
to
use
it
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
while
youre
waiting
to
take
the
course
it
might
take
a
few
weeks
in
dc
as
i
recall
there
were
always
waiting
lists
in
boston
could
you
save
up
some
more
money
to
start
out
right
say
for
riding
gear
plus
the
cost
bike
plus
maybe
guess
to
a
mechanic
to
make
sure
the
machine
is
safe
assuming
you
economize
by
buying
some
old
beatup
machine
from
a
private
individual
plus
insurance
plus
registration
and
licensing
fees
plus
the
course
youre
looking
at
maybe
not
including
the
bike
itself
and
a
reserve
for
ongoing
maintenance
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
i
pay
about
insurance
now
upstate
ny
but
it
was
closer
to
in
boston
more
urban
for
decent
insurance
including
substantial
coverage
for
liability
which
you
want
unless
you
plan
always
to
be
poor
id
guess
dc
is
more
like
boston
than
like
a
rural
area
ergo
more
expensive
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
there
used
to
be
annual
buyers
guides
in
the
usual
motorcycle
magazines
i
found
those
helpful
in
getting
an
idea
of
what
new
or
recent
models
might
be
available
you
could
probably
look
through
past
issues
to
size
up
what
used
bikes
might
be
available
my
first
bike
was
years
old
when
i
bought
it
so
i
went
on
my
friends
advice
instead
also
look
at
the
bikes
that
you
see
people
riding
or
that
are
parked
on
the
street
i
basically
settled
on
my
present
bike
by
noticing
that
there
were
a
lot
of
highmileage
bmws
running
around
and
they
were
generally
set
up
the
way
i
wanted
nothing
wrong
with
talking
to
various
dealers
in
your
area
or
visiting
showrooms
dealers
in
the
boston
area
at
least
when
i
was
shopping
were
very
nice
about
letting
you
look
around
their
showrooms
and
quoting
prices
for
bikes
that
werent
the
latest
models
hence
cheaper
although
i
ended
up
buying
both
bikes
in
private
sales

cable
looks

shielded

finish
and
has

mechanism
i
dont
know
if
its
adjustable

my

says
its
more
difficult
to
pick
than

is
there
any

i
dropped

about

or
higher
maybe
not

i
dont

replacing

would
i
do
better

which
doesnt

wearing

shoei
which
is
a

more
comfortable
keeps
the

out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damage
id
wear
the
full
facer
but
then
id
be
way
more
worried
about
wind
blast
in
the
face
and
inability
to
hear

than
the
helmet
being
a
little
damaged
also
what
would
you
all
reccomend
as
far
as
good
helmets
im
slightly
disappointed
by
how
badly
the
shoei
has
scratched
etc
from
not
being
bloody
careful
about
it
and
how
little
impact
it
took
to
chip
the

arguably
mess
it
up
period
looking
at

really
good
fullface
with
good

protection
i
like
the
shoei
style
kinda
like
the
norton
one
i
saw
awhile
back
too
but
suspect
im
going
to
have
to
get
a
much
more
expensive
helmet
if
i
want
to
not
replace
it
every
time
im
not
being
careful
where
i
set
it
down
well
my
next
helmet
will
be
subject
to
it
fitting
well
an

thats
just
because
i
like
the
looks
my
current
one
is
a

crashed

i
dont
treat

no
no
no
no
all
i
am
saying
is
that
you
dont
even
need
to
tell
people
the
technique
of
countersteering
cos
they
will
do
it
intuitively
the
first
time
they
try
to
go
round
a
corner
some
will
and
others
will
steer
with
their
tuchuses
i
dont
know
how
much
the
teaching
of
countersteering
in
the
beginner
course
really
helps
the
tuchus
steerers
i
was
one
i
guess
that
i
always
steered
a
bicycle
that
way
and
i
only
got
the
hang
of
countersteering
in
normal
riding
after
the
course
i
could
do
the
countersteering
swerves
in
the
course
no
problem
but
i
only
started
using
it
in
my
normal
riding
when
i
decided
that
my
turning
at
speed
offramps
and
the
like
was
a
lot
more
difficult
that
it
should
have
been
i
knew
how
it
works
although
thats
currently
up
for
debate
definitely
knew
that
it
works
as
i
could
do
it
in
swerves
but
only
figured
it
out
later
in
my
normal
riding
just
a
data
point
i
think
that
its
not
a
bad
idea
to
bring
the
idea
up
but
its
best
to
let
everyone
tuchussteer
for
the
first
lesson
or
two
so
they
can
learn
to
shift
gears
before
they
have
to
worry
about
proper
handlebar
technique
countersteering
in
fact
my
experienced
rider
course
instructors
claimed
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
turn
to
whichever
side
they
wanted
just
by
shifting
their
weight
around
even
when
the
operator
was
trying
to
turn
in
the
opposite
direction
i
admit
ive
never
actually
seen
this
i
have
in
our
beginner
course
we
had
passenger
training
sometime
during
the
lesson
the
instructor
would
hop
on
the
back
of
the
bike
and
the
student
would
take
him
for
a
ride
if
the
student
did
not
give
the
instructor
the
you
are
a
sack
of
potatoes

speech
the
instructor
would
steer
the
bike
and
make
a
general
nuisance

himself

i
owned
a

helmet
took
what
i
would
consider
a
minor
fall
and
had
visible
damage
to
the
shell
yes
the
helmet
did
its
job
but
the

ratio
was
scary
i
own

now
have
taken
impacts
on

twice
the
bieffe
impact
we
do
this
frequently
in

and
dont
even
have
a
scratch
on
it
after
two

my
recommendation
is
to
buy
high
quality
gear
ymmv
when
your

nogin
hits
an
immoveabe

there
are

four
things

object
the

shell
the

the

the

ok
five
assuming
that
the
helmet
head
assembly
takes
the
same
impact
if
the
shell
cracks
in
one
case
then
in
the
other
the
liner
must
be
dented
or
the
head
gets
jiggled
if
its
the
the
liner
thats
dented
the
helmet
is
just
as
toast
as
if
the
shell
were
cracked
it
wont
absorb
energy
form
an
impact
in
that
area
if

is

do
a

on
a

with

yes
but
the

wheel
comes
off
the
ground
not
the
front
see
it
just
hops
into

john
stafford
sure
you
can
do
wheelies
with
a
shaft
drive
bike
i
had
a
bmw
that
was
a
wheelie
monster
of
course
it
didnt
have
the
initial
power
burst
to
just
twist
it
into
the
air
i
had
to
pop
the
clutch
i
also
had
to
replace
front
fork
seals
a
few
times
as
well
the
fairing
is
a
bit
heavy
to
be
slamming
down
onto
those
little
stantion
tubes
all
the
time
but
let
me
give
you
fair
warning
i
trashed
the
ringpinion
gear
in
the
final
drive
of
my
i
assume
doing
wheelies
and
this
was
no
cheap
fix
either
there
is
some
kind
of
slip
device
in
the
shaft
to
prevent
it
from
breaking
unfortunately
it
didnt
save
the
gears
on
the
topic
of
wheelies
the
other
day
i
saw
a
kid
on
a
big
hurricane
do
a
stoppy
or
rear
wheelie
man
he
had
the
rear
end
on
this
bike
up
about
feet
off
the
ground
at
a
traffic
light
i
dont
recommend
these
activities
anymore
now
that
im
an
old
guy
with
kids
of
my
own
but
it
looked
damn
impressive
if
you
cant
keep
both

on

at

strange

hi
i
t
was
very
nice
out
yesterday
in
the
burgh
so
i
rode
my
bike
to
my
gynecologist
appointment
when
he
came
in
to
do
the
exam
he
noticed
my
helmet
sitting
on
a
chair
he
got
excited
and
picked
it
up
and
started
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
about
bikes
and
dealers
in
the
area
and
the
msf
course
apparently
he
rode
a
friends
for
a
while
years

and
recently
the
bug
to
ride
caught
him
again
needless
to
say
i
had
never
before
talked
about

later
copied

the

side

no
not
at
all
the
viking
was
a
trick
little
unit
made
way
back
when
forties
fifties
when
spag
was
trying
to
make
a
go
of
it
in
racing
the
first
iteration
the
springer
was
a
boxer
twin
very
similar
to
max
frizs
famous
design
but
with
an
overhead
point
cam
see
below
for
more
on
the
valvetrain
the
problem
was
that
the
thing
had
no
ground
clearance
whatsoever
the
solution
was
to
curve
the
cylinder
bores
so
that
the
ground
clearance
was
substantially
increased
springer
motor
front
viking
motor
front
this
is
roughly
the
idea
except
that
the
bores
were
gradually
curved
around
a
radius
as
the
pistons
were
loath
to
make
a
sharpangled
turn
in
the
middle
of
their
stroke
the
engine
also
had
curved
connecting
rods
to
accomodate
the
stroke
the
engine
stuck
out
so
far
because
of
its
revolutionary
and
still
unique
overhead
cam
system
through
the
use
of
clever
valve
timing
and
and
extrordinarily
trick
valve
linkage
only
a
single
cam
lobe
was
required
to
drive
both
overhead
valves
just
as
revolutionary
was
the
hydraulic
valve
actuation
which
used
a
pressurized
stream
of
oil
to
power
the
waterwheel
which
kept
the
lobe
spinning
over
one
side
effect
that
required
some
rather
brutal
engineering
fixes
was
that
until
the
engines
oil
pressure
came
up
to
normal
the
engines
valve
timing
would
be
more
or
less
random
resulting
in
some
impressive
startup
valve
damage
the
solution
was
a
little
hand
crank
that
pressurized
the
cases
before
you
started
the
beast
remarkably
similar
to
the
system
used
in
new
porsches
to
pressurize
the
oil
system
before
the
car
is
started
the
cage
however
uses
an
electric
oil
pump
wimps
despite
this
fix
the
engine
had
a
nasty
propensity
for
explosively
firing
its
valves
into
the
pistons
when
a
cylinder
would
temporarily
lose
a
bit
of
oil
pressure
in
a
corner
the
solution
was
to
run
even
higher
oil
pressures
and
change
the
gaskets
and
seals
regularly
this
was
feasible
because
it
was
a
racing
engine
with
just
a
single
overhead
lobe
and
no
pushrodshaftchain
towers
because
of
the
hydraulic
system
the
head
of
the
engine
came
to
an
almost
perfect

note
that
the
tip
was
not
truly
vertical
it
was
at
about
a

angle
to
the

and
this
drawing
doesnt
show
the

because
there
was
none
in

the

the

of
the
pointy
heads
on

of
a
pair
of
gently
pundits
of
the
day
even
said
sensuously
curved

was
much
like
a
pair
of
finned
viking
horns
poking
out
from
beneath
the
gas
tank
thus
the
name
the
vik
was
a
moderately
successful
racer
lightning
fast
when
it
worked
but
plagued
by
problems
relating
to
its
revolutionary
technology
eventually
it
was
dumped
when
spag
finally
realized
that
racing
was
not
where
the
spagthorpe
name
would
be
made
the
machines
were
raced
for
another
year
or
two
by
privateers
and
their
fate
approximately
six
vikings
were
made
plus
one
or
possibly
two
springers
confusing
the
issue
is
one
old
spag
staffer
who
swears
up
and
down
that
this
machine
was
tooled
for
production
and
that
as
many
as
twenty
or
thirty
machines
may
have
come
off
the
line

first
the
krypto
cable
i
bought
is
not
made
by
kryptonite
is
not
covered
by
the
kryptonite
guarantee
and
doesnt
even
approach
kryptonite
standards
of
quality
and
quality
assurance
it
is
just
some
generic
madeintaiwan
cable
lock
with
the
kryptonite
name
on
it
secondly
the
latch
engagement
mechanism
is
something
of
a
joke
i
dont
know
if
mine
was
a
particularly
poor
example
but
it
was
often
quite
frustrating
to
get
the
latch
to
positively
engage
and
sometimes
it
would
seem
to
engage
only
to
fall
open
when
i
went
to
unlock
it
thirdly
the
lock
has
a
little
plastic
door
on
the
keyway
which
serves
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
any
attempt
to
insert
the
key
in
the
dark
i
didnt
try
it
obviously
but
i
have
my
doubts
that
the
lock
mechanism
would
stand
up
to
an
insert
screwdriver
and
torque
attack
fourthly
the
cable
was
not
in
my
opinion
of
sufficient
thickness
to
deter
theft
for
my
piece
of
crap
bicycle
that
is
all
cables
suffer
the
weakness
that
they
can
be
cut
a
few
strands
at
a
time
if
you
are
patient
you
can
cut
cables
with
fingernail
clippers
aviation
snips
would
go
through
the
cable
in
well
under
a
minute

yes

friends

whove
been

in

accidents
not
them
they
were
hit
and
my
cousin
is
still
recovering
no
i
cant
take
back
what
happened
yes
it
was
stupid
but
by
reminding
me
about
it
all
the
time
youre
neither
helping
me
or
yourself
so
stuff
your
opinion
hey
man
you
brought
it
up
i
agree
completely
driving
drunk
is
really
stupid
and
i
understand
and
appreciate
that
you
feel
bad
about
it
but
dwi
is
endemic
in
our
society
it
is
a
real
problem
and
we
as
motorcyclists
can
be
in
the
worst
of
vulnerable
positions
around
a
drunk
driver
alert
readers
might
remember
that
last
year
i
witnessed
a
dwi
accident
right
bloody
in
front
of
me
and
was
unable
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
the
participants
as
i
reported
here
also
drunk
driving
by
motorcyclists
is
a
prime
cause
of
their
injury
and
death
which
raises
the
insurance
rates
forces
stupidly
restrictive
laws
and
turns
the
public
against
those
of
us
who
ride
responsibly
in
my
view
drunk
driving
should
carry
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offenses
which
is
not
a
public
funds
issue
but
a
genuine
safety
issue
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admitting
having
been
caught
dwi
and
looking
for
sympathy
over
the
consequences
dont
expect
people
to
respond

warm

i

countersteering

before
basically
there
are
two
ways

holding
the
reins

and
pulling
against
the
horses
neck
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
go
when
training
a
plowsteering
horse
to
neckrein
one
technique
is
to
cross
the
reins
under
his
necks
thus
when
neckreining
to
the
left
the
right
rein
pulls
against
the
right
side

the

request
for
opinions
which
is
better
a
onepiece
aerostitch
or
a
twopiece
aerostitch
were
looking
for
more
than
well
the
is
more
versatile
but
the
is
better
protection
thanks
in
advance
nadine
what
is
best
books
have
been
written
on
that
but
in
regard
to
aerostich
it
really
depends
on
your
particular
size
shape
and
needs
if
you
upper
and
lower
body
are
not
proportional
according
to
aero
dimensions
then
it
probably
is
going
to
be
better
mixing
and
matching
the
piece
suit
i
have
the
piece
suit
and
i
am
very
happy
with
it
having
my
life
quota
of
scars
from
crashing
off
road
i
am
very
concerned
with
good
protection
and
i
believe
that
the
difference
in
protection
between
the
and
piece
suits
is
almost
negligible
i
think
the
optional
hip
pads
and
back
protector
make
much
more
of
a
difference
one
thing
that
is
nice
about
the
piece
is
if
you
go
somewhere
and
then
want
to
walk
around
for
a
while
still
with
jacket
you
can
just
detach
and
stow
the
pants
one
thing
to
note
is
that
goldfine
has
problems
getting
a
good
fit
for
many
women
with
standard
suits
supposedly
for
smaller
women
and
petite
men
for
that
matter
the
piece
will
fit
better
another
recommendation
is
to
pay
for
mods
if
you
need
them
i
wish
i
got
inches
added
to
my
pant
legs
i
find
the
long
suits
are
not
really
that
long
i
cant
imagine
how
short

the

ryancousineaucompdynquestororg
ryan

cb
dont
be
so
stupid
as
to
leave
your
helmet
on
the
seat
where
it
can
cb
fall
down
and
go
boom
ryan
another
good
place
for
your
helmet
is
your
mirror
i
kid
you
not
this
is
very
bad
advice
helmets
have
two
major
impact
absorbing
layers
a
hard
outer
shell
and
a
closedcell
foam
impact
layer
most
helmets
lose
their
protective
properties
because
the
inner
liner
compacts
over
time
long
before
the
outer
shell
is
damaged
or
delaminates
from
age
dr
hurt
tested
helmets
for
many
years
following
his
landmark
study
and
has
estimated
that
a
helmet
can
lose
up
to
of
its
effectiveness
from
inner
liner
compression
i
have
a
video
he
produced
that
discusses
this
phenomenon
in
detail
puncture
compression
of
the
type
caused
by
mirrors
sissy
bars
and
other
relatively
sharp
objects
is
the
worst
offender
even
when
the
comfort
liner
is
unaffected
dents
and
holes
in
the
foam
can
seriously
degrade
the
effectiveness
of
a
helmet
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
parking
your
lid
on
the
mirrors
i
suggest
you
look
under
the
comfort
liner
at
the
condition
of
the
foam
if
it
is
significantly
damaged
or
missing
replace
the
helmet

so
the
question
i
have
is
how
dangerous
is
riding
tough
question
more
dangerous
than
driving
a
car
and
far
more
dangerous
if
you
dont
apply
a
modicum
of
intelligence
to
the
activity
basically
stupidity
will
get
you
hurtkilled
a
lot
faster
on
a
motorcycle
than
in
a
car
but
with
care
it
is
not
unreasonably
dangerous
also
buying
good
protective
clothing
is
helpful
that
way
if
something
does
go
wrong
you
are
likely
to
be
less
severely
injured
first
thing
if
possible
take
a
msf
driver
training
course
this
will
get
you
started
on
the
right
foot
they
teach
control
of
the
vehicle
and
safe
riding
practices
second
buy
protective
gear
at
minimum
a
good
helmet
and
a
pair
of
leather
gloves
are
a
must
a
good
sturdy
piece
of
footgear
is
also
very
helpful
though
leather
hiking
boots
a
pair
of
old
army
boots
or
something
similar
works
fine
for
this
purpose
as
long
as
you
make
sure
the
laces
stay
tied
after
those
a
leather
jacket
and
leather
pants
or
chaps
are
nice
as
well
but
these
are
also
expensive
items
for
the
pants
many
people
consider
a
good
pair
of
jeans
to
be
reasonable
preferably
recent
and
of
a
fairly
heavy
weight
similarly
for
a
jacket
a
good
jean
jacket
is
a
reasonable
compromise
though
more
people
tend
to
have
leather
jackets
around
than
pants
another
thing
to
do
is
drop
in
on
garage
sales
looking
for
a
secondhand
leather
jacket
look
for
a
fairly
thick
leather
in
these
items
third
dont
do
anything
stupid
dont
ride
after
drinking
even
one
drink
can
noticeably
affect
you
judgement
and
balance
dont
ride
in
the
snow
or
when
conditions
are
such
that
black
ice
is
likely
be
very
careful
riding
in
the
rain
slow
way
down
take
corners
gingerly
brake
early
and
gently
try
not
to
ride
if
you
are
sick
tired
taking
any
medication
with
drowsiness
warnings
or
otherwise
not
in
average
shape
with
care
you
should
be
ok
the
next
question
i
have
is
what
bike
would
you
recommend
for
a
first
time
rider
i
dont
want
to
race
nor
do
i
want
to
ride
cross
country
nor
do
i
want
to
ride
on
dirt
trails
ill
probably
drive
it
on
back
roads
with
occasional
rides
on
city
streets
and
freeways
the
maximum
i
can
spend
is
about
so
ill
be
looking
at
a
used
bike
i
would
suggest
mid
to
late
japanese
midsized
standard
something
in
cc
range
would
probably
be
reasonable
if
you
are
shorterlighter
than
average
you
might
want
to
go
as
low
as
a
cc
bike
possible
models
the
suzuki
gs
series
eg
etc
these
are
generally
inline
bikes
generally
dependable
except
for
a
tendency
to
weakness
in
the
charging
system
stator
andor
regulatorrectifier
problems
my
first
bike
was
a
about
it
server
me
well
the
honda
nighthawk
series
this
may
also
be
known
as
the
cb
series
i
think
eg
honda
etc
this
is
another
series
of
standard
motorcycles
also
fairly
dependable
kawasaki
and
yamaha
probably
have
similar
bikes
but
i
dont
know
them
as
well
for
mid
to
late
models
of
the
above
you
should
be
able
to
buy
the
bike
for
under
leaving
you

this

roadmthamilton

for
you
sf
bay
areans
id
say
this
is
a
very
bad
idea
you
should
start
out
with
something
much
mellower
so
that
neither
one
of
you
get
in
over
your
head
that
particular
road
requires
full
concentration
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
to
take
a
passenger
on
for
the
first
time
once
you
both
decide
that
you
like
riding
together
and
want
to
do
something
longer
and
more
challenging
then
go
for
a
hard
core
road
like
minesmt
hamilton
in
any
case
its
your
moral
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
she
has
proper
gear
that
fits
especially
if
youre
going

driving

finally
the
was
a
saturday
without
much
rain
in
fact
it
cleared
up
became
warm
and
sunny
and
the
wind
died
about
three
weeks
ago
i
took
a
long
cool
ride
on
the
hawk
down
to
cycles
for
a
test
ride
they
had
sold
and
delivered
the
demo
about
fifteen
hours
before
i
arrived
and
the
demo
vfr
was
bikelocked
in
the
showroom
surrounded
by
other
bikes
and
not
likely
to
move
soon
today
was
different
there
were
even
more
bikes
used
dirt
bikes
used
street
bikes
cars
and
a
big
tent
full
of
outlandishly
fat
touring

with

were
all
squeezed
in
the

some
sort

running

there
was
the

that

it
seemed

another

in

we
went
over

i
put
the

my

put

thats
nice

i

hard

three

as

the

seemed
nearly
out

just
idling
on

of
the

all
the

seemed

about
five

goes

heavily

it

responds
well

no

was
fairly
quiet

the

was
nontrivial

nearly
effortless

not
sure
what
the

reminds
me
of
but
it
is
pleasant
if
only
the

too
urban
the

in

it
shows
its

we
went
by

a

where
you
could
really

his

was
about

down
after
putting

for
a

we
turned
and
went

into

because
the

was

well
now
it
had

it
was

tried
some
high

lane

some
wide
sweeping
turns
time
to
wick
it
up
i
went
until
the
buffeting
was
threating
to
pull
us
off
the
seat
and
stayed
there
when
i
was
comfortable
with
the

the

i
looked

i
rolled
off

wanted
to

about

i
managed
to
thread
the

to

i

this

is
lbs

small
so
i

weight
as

much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
youll
likely
not
notice
her
weight
too
much
a
piece
of
advice
for
you
dont
be
abrupt
with
the
throttle
no
wheelies
accelerate
a
wee
bit
more
slowly
than
usual
consciously
worry
about
spitting
her
off
the
back
its
as
much
your
job
to
keep
her
on
the
pillion
as
it
is
hers
and
i
guarantee
shell
be
put
off
by
the
bike
ripping
out
from
under
her
when
you
whack
it
open
keep
the
lean
angles
pretty
tame
the
first
time
out
too
you
and
her
need
to
learn
each
others
body
english
she
needs
to
learn
what
your

is
about
how
to
take
the
turn

you
need
to
learn
her
idea
of
shit
dont
crash
now
so
you
dont
work
at
cross
purposes
while
leaned
over
you
can
work
up
to
more

riding
over
time

tell

the

light
for

i

its

heavy

heavy
for

it

it
isnt

maybe
in

with
a
full
tank
its
in
the
area
of
lbs
depending
on
year
etc
youre
you
should
have
no
problem
physically
managing
it
the
seat
is
roughly
akin
to
a
plasticcoated
very
firm
to
very
painful
depending
upon
time
in
the
saddle
the
and
versions
had
a
much
better
seat
imo
the
bike
suffers
from
the
infamous
suzuki
regulator
problem
i
have
so
far
avoided
forking
out
the
roughly
for
the
suzuki
part
by
kludging
in
different
honda
regulatorrectifier
units
from
junkyards
the
charging
system
consistently
overcharges
the
battery
i
have
to
refill
it
nearly
weekly
this
in
itself
is
not
so
bad
but
battery
access
is
gained
only
after
removing
the
seat
the
tank
and
the
airbox
my
regulator
lasted
over
miles
and
didnt
overcharge
the
battery
the
wiring
connectors
in
the
charging
path
did
get
toasty
though
tending
to
melt
their
insulation
i
suspect
they
were
underspecified
it
didnt
help
that
they
were
well
removed
from
cool
air
battery
access
on
the
earlier
bikes
doesnt
require
tank
removal
after
you
learn
the
drill
its
pretty
straightforward
replacement

this
person
is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
ive
never
liked
my
passengers
to
try
and
shift
their
weight
with
the
turns
at
all
i
find
the
weight
shift
can
be
very
sudden
and
unnerving
its
one
thing
if
theyre
just
getting
comfortable
or
decide
to
look
over
your
other
shoulder
but
i
dont
recommend
having
himher
shift
her
weight
with
each
turn
too
violent
also
i
think
someone
already
said
this
make
sure
your
passenger
wears
good
gear
i
sometimes
choose
to
ride
without
a
helmet
or
lacking
other
safety
gear
depends
on
how
squidly
i
feel
but
i
wont
let
passengers
do
it
what
i
do
to
myself
i
can
handle
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
hurt
anyone
else
so
i
dont
let
them
on
without
gloves
jacket
at
least
jeans
heavy
boots
and
a
helmet
that
fits
i
really
want
this
to
be
a
positive
experience
for
us
both
mainly
so
that
shell
want
to
go
with
me
again
so
any
help
will
be
appreciated
go
real
easy
its
amazing
how
solid
a
grip
you
have
on
the
handle
bars
that
your
passenger
does
not
dont
make
her
feel
like
shes
going
to
slide
off
the
back
and
snappy
turns
for
you
are
sickening
lurches
for
her
in
general
it
feels
much
less
controlled
and
smooth
as
a
passenger
i
cant
stand
being
on
the
back
of
my
brothers
bike
and
i
ride
aggressively
when
i
ride
and
i
know
hes
a
good
pilot
still
everything
feels
very
unsteady

youre

youre
neither

so
stuff
your
opinion
hey
man
you
brought
it
up
i
agree
completely
driving
drunk
is
really
stupid
and
i
understand
and
appreciate
that
you
feel
bad
about
it
but
dwi
is
endemic
in
our
society
it
is
a
real
problem
and
we
as
motorcyclists
can
be
in
the
worst
of
vulnerable
positions
around
a
drunk
driver
alert
readers
might
remember
that
last
year
i
witnessed
a
dwi
accident
right
bloody
in
front
of
me
and
was
unable
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
the
participants
as
i
reported
here
also
drunk
driving
by
motorcyclists
is
a
prime
cause
of
their
injury
and
death
which
raises
the
insurance
rates
forces
stupidly
restrictive
laws
and
turns
the
public
against
those
of
us
who
ride
responsibly
in
my
view
drunk
driving
should
carry
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offenses
which
is
not
a
public
funds
issue
but
a
genuine
safety
issue
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admitting
having
been
caught
dwi
and
looking
for
sympathy
over
the
consequences
dont
expect

exhaust

since
at
least
one
other
person
was
interested
in
this
my
fzrs
black
exhaust
pipes
are
rusty
and
i
researched
getting
them
repaired
yesterday
i
bought
a
can
of
vht
degree
black
header
paint
and
spent
an
hour
sanding
two
of
the
header
pipes
by
hand
sprayed
on
paint
thought
about
how
clean
i
was
able
to
get
the
metal
with
sanding
and
determined
that
i
wouldnt
be
at
all
suprised
if
the
paint
worechipped
off
in
a
month
soooo
call
a
couple
of
places
up
in
minneapolis
and
discover
that
powder
coating
while
extremely
durable
will
not
handle
over
degree
temperatures
the
place
i
talked
to
said
they
were
experimenting
with
some
new
powder
that
is
supposed
to
handle
degrees
but
that
it
wouldnt
be
available
for
months
at
least
they
directed
me
to
another
shop
that
specializes
in
header
coating
the
other
shop
said
they
have
coatings
available
one
is
aluminized
that
can
do
degrees
and
is
comparable
to
powder
coating
for
durability
the
other
is
silicon
i
think
based
and
can
do
degrees
but
is
thinner
and
not
as
durable
both
coatings
have
a
textured
finish
not
super
smooth
and
should
be
cleaned
with
hot
water
and
a
brush

was
im
planning
to
take
the

up
friday
and

back

next

maybe

sounds
to
me
like
this
kind
of

should
be
way
better

in

my
experienced

course

karrclaimed
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
karrturn
to
whichever
side
they
wanted
just
by
shifting
their

karraround
even
when
the
operator
was
trying

karrdirection
i
admit
ive
never
actually
seen
this
ive
experienced
this
back
when
i
was
younger
and
more
foolish
my
first
bike
used
to
track
extremely
true
going
down
the
highway
i
would
set
the
throttle
tension
screw
up
enough
to
hold
the
gas
steady
slide
back
on
the
seat
and
lean
against
the
backrest
riding
without
any
hands
if
i
needed
to
turn
id
shift
my
weight
into
the
turn
and
lo
and
behold
the
bike
would
turn
sans
touching
the
bars
granted
it
wouldnt
turn
very
fast
but
it
proves
that
you
can
turn
a
bike
without
countersteering
at
least
not
in
terms
of
the
input
to
the
bar
normally
associated
with
countersteering
as
ive
said
i
know
many
people
who
think
all
you
do
is
lean
and
any
input
theyre
giving
to
the
bar
is
totally
unconscious
whereas
that
may
be
sufficient
to
get
you
down
the
road
under
normal
circumstances
possibly
for
years
at
a
stretch
i
cant
think
of
anybody
whod
argue
that
this
is
preferable
to
properly
knowing
how
to
manipulate
the

i
now
own
two

would
love
to
keep
them
both
one
is
a
capable
and
smooth
street
bike
low
and
lightweight
with
wide
power
and
great
brakes
the
other
is
a
beemer
gs
kind
of
rough
for
the
city
but
great
on
the
long
road
and
backroad
a
good
start
at
a
stable
but
i
dont
think
its
going
to
work
unfortunately
insurance
is
going
to
pluck
me
by
the
short
hairs
unless
some
insurance
agent
offers
a
multivehicle
discount
they
do
this
all

assuming
that
youre
only

that

new
passengers
are
a

because
you
never

react

some
people
catch
on
immediately
and
lean

others
are
completely
skittish
about
the
leaning
thing
and
keep
their
bodies
perpendicular

this
is
a
pain
while
turning
but
manageable
the
worst
are
the
passengers
who
stay
perpendicular
to
the

remember
in

of
a

whip
around

theyre

trust
the

to

ive
driven
many

on
this
thing
and
know
how
to
operate
it
enjoy
the
ride
this
is
important
to
stress
for
example
one
of
my
firsttime
passwngers
seemed
to
watch
the
speedo
like
a
hawk
i
drove
her
to
the
beach
down
and
whever
we
topped
mph
shed
holler
slow
down
im
scared
i
humored
her
for
a

then
simply
covered
the
speedometer
with
the
spare
piece
of
duct
tape
i
keep
stuck
to
the
top
of
the
cluster
problem
solved
she
watched
the
scenery
instead
of
the
instruments
and
had
a
much
better
time
based
on
her
experience
driving
a
lincoln
continental
she
was
unwilling
to
trust
my
ability
to
choose
a
safe
speed
for
the
bike
usually
ill
point
out
the
controls
engine
transmission
brakes
tires
etc
and
discuss
motorcycle
physics
a
bit
too
for
firsttimers
helps
calm
their
nerves
and
gives
the
bike
a
chance
to
warm
up
watch
out
for
gravel
on
the
mt
hamilton
road
there
were
lots
of
little
mudslides
after
the
last

rain
by
now
many
of
the
blind
corners
will
be
nicely
covered
with
a
carpet
of

this

thing
has
anyone
while
driving
a
cage
ever
waved
at
bikers
i
get
the
urge
but
ive
never
actually
done
it
ive
had
people
in
cages
wave
at
me
or
give
me
the
thumbs
up
on
occassion
i
always
return
the
wave
or
thumbs
up
that
never
happened
to
me
until
i
started
riding
harleys
so
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
why
not
try
waving

bad
could

charles

writes
to
followup
i
had
a
bad
experience
w
a
krypto
lock
too
last
year
i
bought
a
krypto
cable
ii
long
something
like
that
that
by
all
standards
seemed
like
a
decent
piece
until
i
used
it
anyway
so
in
short
the
cables
seems
to
be
pretty
useless
i
would
guess
the
larger
cable
seems
to
be
a
much
better
unit
ive
got
the
larger
cable
about
inch
in
diameter
actually
i
think
its
larger
about
feet
long
which
coils
into
a
or
inch
coil
with
the
tubular
key
lock
like
the
ulocks
it
has
worked
fine
for
me
for
two
years
now
and
seems
to
me
anyway
that
it
is
very
secure
it
doesnt
have
the
weaknesses
that
the
ulocks
have
other
than
the
liquid
nitrogen
trick
supposedly
is
much
easier
to
store
in
my
tankbag
than
a
ulock
and
more
versatile

got
mine

owww
well
i
hate
to
be
a
wet
sock
but
well
i
was
a
passenger
on
many
bikes
for
the
longest
time
before
i
started
riding
myelf
and
i
grew
to
hate
long
rides
on
sport
bikes
the
passenger
seats
are
not
designed
for
long
rides
the
passenger
positions
arent
even
usually
designed
for
short
rides
i
ended
up
torturing
my
knees
and
my
back
by
taking
long
rides
as
a
passenger
on
sport
bikes
one
of
the
reasons
i
originally
liked
my
current
guythingy
so
much
was
becase
he
had
a
bmw
id
suggest
a
shorter
extended
ride
at
first
a
short
turn
in
the
mountains
or
some
such
then
see
how
much
pain
shes
in
and
proceed
from
there
the
best
advice
id
give
a
beginning
passenger
dont
get
on
the
bike
until
the
rider
says
its
ok
and
work
out
some
sort
signal
for
the
rider
to
tell
you
when
its
ok
to
get
off
after
i
get
on
the
bike
i
squeeze
my
riders
hips
to
tell
that
im
ready
and
at
the
stop
he
nods
his
head
to
show
its
ok
for
me
to
get
off
keep
your
feet
on
the
pegs
at
all
times
dont
wiggle
unless
your
rider
asks
you
to
the
best
passengers
are
those
which
are
unobtrusive
echo
the
movements
and
lean
of
your
rider
look
over
the
shoulder
thats
most
comfortable
but
during
turns
look
over
the
shoulder
on
the
inside
of
the
turn
get
used
to
your
riders
shifting
style
riders
use
a
reasonably
consistent
shifting
style
avoid
helmet
bonk
helmet
bonk
is
when
your
rider
revs
the
bike
up
and
then
shifts
and
the
sudden
change
in
foreward
acceleration
causes
your
helmet
to
bonk
hishers
it
gets
old
real
fast
when
pulling
to
a
stop
put
a
hand
or
both
hands
on
the
tank
to
keep
your
weight
from
pushing
your
rider
up
onto
the
tank
putting
your
hands
on
the
tank
is
also
a
good
way
to
stretch
your
back
if
youre
in
pain
but
im
told
it
gets
harder
to
steer
in
turns
if
you
leave
them
there
switch
your
hands
to
the
guardrail
to
stretch
your
shoulders
but
be
sure
and
squeeze
your
thighs
while
youre
doing
it
so
your
rider
knows
youre
still
there
the
guard
rail
isnt
as
safe
as
holding
onto
your
rider
dont
be
afraid
to
ask
for
frequent
stops
if
youre
in
pain
or
losing
feeling
in
your
feet
passenger
seats
are
not
generally
designed
for
comfort
work
out
some
sort
of
pull
over
signal
beforehand

strong

he

all
this
macho

aside
the
fact
is
that
when
you
are
riding
a

and
a
dog
is
arrowing
to
intercept
it
may
be
unwise
for
you
to
stop
and
try
to
deal
with
the
dog
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
might
be
through
your
leathers
and
working
on
your
jeans
before
you
can
dismount
and
deal
with
it
properly
by
all
means
if
you
do
kick
the
dog
or
otherwise
get
its
attention
stop
and
stay
there
if
you
kick
the
dog
and
ride
away
that
is
a
victory
for
the
dog
it
drove
you
out

it
is
not

it
is
a

if

serious
and
back
off
now
you
have
established
your
dominance
over
the

and
it
probably
will
not
bother
you
again
llamas
however
are
a
different
story
if
you
stop

it

just
hop

in

i
purchased
the
charger
believe
it

the
thing
worked
the

held
a

and
energetically
started
the
car
many

after

weeks
of
just

eventually
i
had
to
purchase
a

battery
anyway
because
the
winter
sun
wasnt
strong
enough
due
to
its
low
angle
i
think
i
paid
or
for
the
charger
there
are
more
powerful
more
expensive
ones
but
i
purchased
the
cheapest
one
i
could
find
ive
never
used
it

have

on

may

may

analagous
in

to
that
behind
motorcycle
handling
characteristics
ok
as
one
last
attempt
ill
take
a
different
tack
we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explanations
for
why
one
can
use
the
handlebars
to
lean
a
moving
motorcycle
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
dominant
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experiment
which
would
seaprate
the
two
characteristics
and
see
which
effect
produces
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
us
who
have
bikes
are
familiar
lets
look
at
the
one
that
so
far
has
sparked
no
controversy
on
its
own
gyroscopic
precession
to
examine
this
alone
we
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
effect
by
not
allowing
the
contact
patches
to
transmit
any
force
the
wheels
and
steering
mechanism
would
have
to
remain
and
be
attached
to
a
vehicle
with
about
the
same
weight
as
a
bike
through
suspension
so
that
the
wheels
transmit
forces
to
the
bike
the
same
way
similar
to
a
bikes
an
experiment
would
be
to
ride
a
bike
along
a
dry
road
to
get
moving
and
to
get
the
wheels
spinning
then
change
surfaces
to
something
that
wont
transmit
forces
through
the
contact
patches
and
try
a
steering
manoeuvre
to
see
if
the
bike
leans
it
probably
would
since
some
of
us
know
how
easy
it
is
to
fall
down
on
ice
but
we
wouldnt
get
a
good
idea
of
how
well
or
what
it
feels
like
because
without
the
contact
patches
we
cant
turn
maybe
theres
a
better
way
besides
even
ice
doesnt
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
forces
altogether
so
wed
have
to
find
a
really
frictionless
surface
youd
have
to
try
it
again
with
the
wheels
locked
to
really
know
if
it
was
the
rotation
that
did
it
looking
at
the
contactpatch
effect
only
however
is
fairly
simple
now
we
have
to
find
a
vehicle
that
gets
the
about
the
same
magnitude
and
direction
of
cantact
patch
forces
as
a
motorcycle
and
transmits
them
about
the
same
way
to
the
vehicle
but
without
rotating
wheels
how
it
gets
the
contact
patch
forces
is
irrelevant
were
just
looking
for
something
that
has
contact
patches
that
can
go
straight
and
not
sideways
and
skis
or
skates
would
do
fine
i
dont
know
of
any
snowski
or
skate
bikes
but
up
here
we
have
the
suzuki
wetbike
that
is
arranged
like
a
motorcycle
but
has
fat
water
skis
where
there
should
be
wheels
i
think
the
propellor
is
in
front
of
the
rear
ski
or
something
like
that
but
we
could
try
it
at
a
coast
to
get
rid
of
most
of
its
effect
now
i
admit
that
this
is
second
hand
info
although
id
love
to
try
one
of
these
but
the
review
in
the
local
cycle
rag
and
a
guy
in
a
bike
shop
that
sells
them
both
say
that
this
machine
handles
very
much
like
a
motorcycle
in
that
you
countersteer
it
to
turn
so
we
have
contact
patches
that
transmit
similar
forces
to
a
bikes
a
similar
suspension
arrangement
and
no
gyroscopes
but
we
do
have
countersteering
conclusion
you
dont
need
gyroscopes
to
countersteer
vehicles
that
have
motorcyclelike
contact
patch
arrangements
we
still
dont
know
what
real
effect
the
gyroscopes
have
when
theyre
there
but
from
my
observations
of
how
handlebar
angle
force
etc
relate
to
steering
in
general
im
willing
to
bet
that
theyre
not
the
dominant
factor
in
countersteering
if
you
dont
like
this
conclusion
then
dont
accept
it
but
my

behaviour
is
consistent
with
it

its
leg
walked
back
to
this
car
he
rolled
down
the
window
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
why
did
i
do
the
right
thing
well
i
used
to
get
mad
and
either
try
to
communicate
my
anger
to
jerks
or
to
uhm
educate
them
in
how
to
improve
their
manners
in
traffic
now
i
just
try
to
get
them
off
my
tail
in
heavy
traffic
i
slow
down
a
bit
mostly
so
i
have
more
buffer
zone
in
front
to
balance
the
minimal
buffer
behind
but
i
also
often
find
that
the
jerk
behind
will
notice
traffic
moving
faster
in
other
lanes
switch
into
one
of
them
and
pass
me
which
is
fine
because
then
i
can
keep
a
better
eye
on
the
jerk
from
behind
while
looking
ahead
rather
than
from
in
front
while
splitting
my
attention
between
ahead
and
the
mirrors
in
traffic
so
heavy
that
there
is
no
way
for
the
jerk
to
pass
i
might
pull
over
as
if
to
look
for
a
street
number
or
name
still
ignoring
the
jerk
just
to
get
the
jerk
off
my
tail
if
this
all
sounds
well
wimpy
or
undenizenly
or
pessimistic
or
perhaps
for
any
psych
types
passiveaggressive
consider
that
i
prefer
to
get
my
adrenaline
jollies
from
riding
rather
than
from
yelling
at
jerks
a
ride
can
improve
my
whole
day
while
yelling
at
a
jerk
is
likely
for
me
to
ruin
my
ride
or
my
day
with
my
own
anger
in
the
worst
case
yelling
at
the
jerk
could
ruin
my
life
since
even
a
tiny
jerk
in
a
cage
behind
me
is
better
armed
with
the
cage
than
i
am
on
a
bike
on
the
other
hand
you
might
try
subtly
arranging
to
be
the
last
vehicle
to
legally
cross
one
or
more
intersections
leaving
the
jerk
waiting
for
cross
traffic
and
thus
off
your
tail
or
crossing
illegally
hopefully
in
front
of
the
waiting
police
like
almost
everything
here
your
choices
and
mileage
will
vary

youre

get
the

is
easy
to

says
little
about
what
one
really
can

should
do
what
the

actually
will
do
is
largely
determined
by
the

that
the

a

less

infighting

some

that

they
were
or
are
looking

in
my
case
i
had
a
faded
cover
stolen
off
a
bmw
that
was
stashed
in
an
apartment
carport
and
not
visible
from
the
street
they
evidently
decided
the
beemer
wasnt
worth
stealing
but
did
try
the
next
night
to
steal
a
honda
hurricane
parked
in
the
next
apartment
building
a
neighbor
heard
them
wheeling
it
out
and
called
the
cops
i
know
this
is
just
setting
myself
up
but
this
is
actually
one
of
the
things
that
is
really
good
about
bmw
bikes
from
all
accounts
ive
heard
practically
no
one
steals
bmws
probably
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzis
and
other
relative
exotics
since
there
isnt
a
large
demand
for
parts
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seems
that
the
most
stolen
bikes
are
harleys
and
jap
sport
bikes
well
id
say
youre
mostly
right
but
for
different
reasons
btw
as
of
a
couple
years
ago
the
most
stolen
bikes
in
orange
county
and
sf
were
gsxs
and
ninjas
probably
the
biggest
reason
bmws
arent
ripped
off
is
that
most
people
who
buy
bmws
will
only
deal
with
the
actual
bmw
dealer
or
mail
order
types
most
of
these
can
have
their
inventory
checked
fairly
easily
by
lawenforcement
types
and
their
markup
is
usually
sufficient
to
keep
them
honest
about
acquiring
parts
for
harleys
and
ricerockets
youve
got
different
situations
there
is
a
huge
aftermarket
in
harley
parts
so
a
bike
can
be
parted
out
fairly
easily
ditto
the
nonsport
japanese
bikes
but
the
prices
on
the
parts
for
these
are
not
as
high
comparatively
for
the
rockets
anytime
a
bike
goes
down
the
plastic
is
usually
cracked
and
is
expensive
to
replace
its
fairly
easy
then
for
a
disreputable
shop
to
take
a
fairing
from
a
stolen
bike
slap
it
on
a
bike
in
for
repair
repaint
it
and
make
a
tidy
profit
the
other
parts
more
traceable
can
be
used
or
discarded
if
they
are
too
traceable

greetings
recmotorcyclists
coming
up
labour
day
weekend
this
year
worldcon
world
science
fiction
convention
will
be
held
in
san
francisco
california
i
am
planning
to
attend
and
have
been
speculating
on
doing
my
trip
there
by
motorcycle
instead
of
by
plane
as
was
my
initial
thought
i
live
and
would
be
departing
from
ottawa
ontario
canada
i
had
planned
to
take
two
weeks
for
this
trip
giving
me
days
travel
time
on
either
side
of
the
weekend
this
looks
like
a
distance
of
about
miles
km
if
your
distance
calc
is
correct
for
an
on
the
road
distance
and
not
as
the
crow
flies
this
is
a
day
for
days
if
you
spend
the
entire
time
on
interstates
which
would
be
a
total
waste
of
time
thats
at
least
hours
on
the
road
every
day
not
including
eatingpeeing
sightseeing
etc
i
was
contemplating
a
similar
trip
but
from
ottawa
to
la
or
maybe
ottawa
to
austin
tx
i
figured
if
i
wanna
do
a
trip
of
this
magnitude
and
enjoy
it
id
have
to
get
my
ass
off
the
major
interstates
and
spend
lots
of
time
enjoying
the
country
around
me
ie
stopping
with
a
camera
meeting
townspeople
going
to
a
few
bars
no
sense
spending
weeks
looking
out
a
helmet
with
the
closest
human
contact
found
at
the
gas
pump
i
estimated
id
need
at
least
weeks
to
make
the
trip
worthwhile
i
am
looking
for
input
opinions
comments
or
snarky
remarks
on
my
sanity
in
question
suggested
routes
note
getting
there
is
important
and
my
schedule
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
room
for
side
trips
or
circuitous
routes
try
and
stay
off
the
interstates
anybody
who
wants
to
join
me
on
this
trip
for
even
part
of
the
distance
depending
on
your
route
and
my
plans
i
may
be
heading
that
way
as
far
as
at
least
detroit

that
comes

check
the
vent
tube
to
the
tank
sometimes
the
tube
is
clogged
or
constricted
this
prevents
gas
from
flowing
into
the
carbs
because
of
the
vacuum
created
by
the
displacement
of
the
gasoline
this
is
the
small
tube
on
the
bottom
of
the
tank
the
large
tube
is
the
overflow
you
will
have
to
remove
the
left
side
tail
section
to
get
access
to
this
area
good
luck
but
if
it
was
clogged
wouldnt
this
interfere
with
engine
operation
all
the
time
when
it
runs
it
runs
well
good
point
did
not
catch
this
in
the
original
post
the
only
other
things
which
come
to
mind
since
this
is
a
gravity
feed
fuel
system
is
this
the
fuel
petcock
valve
is
vacuum
controlled
from
the
carburator
let
suppose
there
is
a
small
hole
or
bad
seal
either
in
the
hose
itself
or
the
vacuum
valve
in
the
fuel
petcock
when
it
is
cold
the
hole
is
open
enough
to
open
the
valve
just
enough
to
allow
gas
to
the
carbs
with
the
choke
on
since
the
choke
creates
more
low
pressure
in
the
carbs
when
on
to
draw
gas
and
as
the
engine
and
surrounding
area
warm
up
the
hole
seals
up
one
way
to
check
fuel
flow
through
the
valve
would
be
to
pull
the
side
panels
off
and
remove
the
fuel
hose
to
the
carbs
connect
a
tube
of
the
correct
size
preferably
clear
tubing
to
observe
fuel
flow
on
the
output
side
of
the
fuel
petcock
remove
the
control
hose
from
carburator
make
sure
the
tank
is
full
place
the
valve
in
the
on
position
and
apply
vacuum
to
the
control
hose
preferably
with
a
vacuum
device
with
a
gauge
to
check
for
air
leaks
with
vacuum
applied
fuel
should
flow
freely
to
see
if
there
is
a
vent
problem
do
this
with
the
fuel
filler
cap
open
and
closed
if
it
flows
a
lot
faster
with
the
filler
cap
open
then
there
may
be
something
in
the
vent
airway
which
changes
position
and
depending
on
the
position
may
clog
or
partially
clog
the
vent
i
have
heard
of
some
fuel
tanks
being
replaced
to
fix
this
problem
so
the
things
which
might
be
defective
are
the
control
hose
from
carb
the
petcock
valve
and
possibly
the
fuel
tank
vent
now
if
all
of
the
above
shows
no
problem
of
fuel
flow
when
cold
then
there
is
something
in
the
carbs
screwed
up
but
there
are
so
many
things
to
check
i
would
be
typing
all
day
to
list
them
all
here
are
a
few
with
everything
back
together
apply
vacuum
to
the
petcock
valve
and
open
the
drain
holes
on
the
carbs
one
by
one
to
check
fuel
flow
open
up
the
airbox
and
check
for
foreign
debris
or
clogged
airways
on
the
carbs
there
are
quite
a
few
on
each
carb
i
hope
something
is
flushed
out
with
all
this
trouble
shooting
if
american
honda
does
not
resolve
this
get
mad
as
hell
and
report
them
to
the
bbb
and
call
the
honda
customer
service
hotline
it
is
a
number
but
i
dont
recall
it
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
called
just
about
tires
for
my
and
a
few
days
later
a
customer
satisfaction
inquiry
card
arrived
at

asking
how

the
support
i
received
here
would
be

well
if
i
were
to
do
that
i
would
never
be
going
over
mph
even
in
gear
so
my
question
is
will
it
hurt
my
new
cycle
to
take
it
up
in
the
rpm
range
so
that
i
can
at
least
go
the
speed
limit
i
had
the
same
inconvenience
when
i
bought
my
only
i
could
at
least
go
mph
during
the
initial
breakin
despite
the
high
quality
of
motor
oils
and
motorcycle
engines
these
days
i
would
follow
the
instructions
and
just
keep
to
city
street
riding
for
the
first
miles
heck
those
miles
go
by
fast
and
its
worth
it
to
know
you
havent
possibly
screwed
up
your
engine

i
have
a
very
important
question
that
i
havent
been
able
to
find
an
answer
toive
asked
mechanics
and
others
about
this
but
no
one
can
really
give
me
an
answer
that
satisfies
me
i
just
bought
a
brand
new
kawasaki
ninja
i
am
a
firsttime
buyer
as
well
as
a
firsttime
rider
and
this
bike
seemed
to
satisfy
all
my
needs
this
may
be
the
reason
i
dont
know
the
answer
to
this
question
the
tachometer
has
a
sticker
right
on
it
that
says
for
the
first
miles
do
not
go
over
rpms
and
for
the
next
miles
dont
go
over
referred
to
as
the
breakin
period
if
you
didnt
know
well
if
i
were
to
do
that
i
would
never
be
going
over
mph
even
in

so
my
question
is
will
it
hurt
my

take
it
up
in
the

that
i
can
at

go

ill

even
when

you
do
something
quite

basically
to
turn

you
to
a

wiggle

causing
a

lean

i

i
was
semiserious
without

lean

the

turns
when
leaning
a
torque
is
applied
at

angle
to
the

axle
just
as

however
this
torque
is
also
about
from

used
your

method
to
break
all
the
different
kinds
of
bike
locks
or
are
you
taking
someones
word
for
it
the
fact
is
it
is
unlikely
that
someone
reading
anything
here
is
going
to
go
into
a
successful
bikestealing
business
because
they
read
anything
in
recmotorcycles
so
please
tell
us
what
you
are
talking
about
we
cant
even
protect
against
an
assault
or
discuss
methods
if
you
dont
come
out
with
it
see
i
have
heard
the
ones
about
the
pipes
and
the
liquid
nitrogen
and
the
cordless
dremel
tools
and
a
bunch
of
other
ones
the
most
plausable
method
i
am
not
a
bike
thief
so
i
really
dont
know
for
certain
is
just
to
put
a
rod
through
each
wheel
and
use
four
guys
to
just
lift
the
bike
into
a
truck
this
works
because
most
people
dont
lock
their
bikes
to
anything
since
that
method
is
so
childishly
easy
i
figure
a
nice
visible
chain
or
cable
locking
the
bike
to
something
is
likely
to
make
a
lazy
thief
go
on
to
the
next
bike
hey
finally
an
advantage
to
the
weight
and
high
cg
of
the
concours
especially
since
i
have
a
bike
that
i
would
hate
to
see
ripped
off
by
such
a
trival
tactic
warning
no
lock
alone
is
a
safe
deterent
against
theft
the
thief
doesnt
need
to
be
a
locksmith
or
a
lockpicker
to
walk
away
with
your
property
i
personally
think
motion
alarms
in
combination
to
a
lock
of
this
type
is
the
way
to
go
if
in
fact
you
are
that
concerned
what
tactic
are
you
referring
to
if
we
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
we
cant
very
well
guard
against
it
can
we
for
my
money
literally
i
rely
on
a
combination
of
a
motiondetector
alarm
with
pager
when
im
out
of
earshot
of
the
bike
in
a
questionable
area
cc
insurance
and
i
try
to
park
in
obvious
visible
areas
with
lots
of
people
about
see
if
someone
just
plays
with
the
bike
without
intention
of
stealing
it
at
least
some
eyes
are
on
it
and
if
they
get
too
rambunctious
theyll
set
off
the
alarm
thats
for
a
nice
bike
for
a
ratbike
the
trick
is
to
always
keep
its
actual
value
well
below
bluebook
so
that
it
looks
so
crappy
nobody
would
want
to
steal
it
and
even
if
they
were
stupid
enough
to
you
would
make
a
profit
on
the
deal
seriously
if
i
for
instance
need
to
go
on
a
business
trip
for
a
week
and
sadly
have
to
leave
the
bikes
sitting
they
both
get
a
shittylooking
but
useable
cover
locked
on
and
both
bikes
locked
to
each
other
and
a
curb
bumper
in
the
parking
lot
under
the
light
i
usually
rig
the
cable
locks
i
use
aircraft
cable
so
that
if
anyone
pulls
on
either
bike
or
the
cable
joining
them
the
concours
alarm
goes
off
and
i
have
a
friend
come
buy
every
day
to
have
a
look
and
make
sure
theyre
still
there
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
had
stolen
was
a
cover
and
that
was
over
winter
storage
with
the
battery
out
of
the
bike
and
thus
no
alarm
oh
put
your
own
eyelets
into
the
cover
for
the
locks
to
pass
through
and
place
them
so
that
they
have
to
absolutely
destroy
the
cover
to
get
it
off
thats
the
best
that
i
can

i

behind

if

in

i
pull
almost
completely
next
to
the
car
in

of
me
if
im
the
only
one
ie
no
car
in

i
turn
the
bike
somewhat
sideways
across
the
lane
to
increase
my

any

vehicle
make

to
keep
your

bright

might
not

i
stop
with
a
bit
of
room
ahead
of
me
usually
about
two
or
three
bike
lengths
this
will
hopefully
give
me
room
to
pull
forward
and
to
the
side

a

approaches

the

mentioned
that

all
i

to

i

at

to

say
you

what

should
i
just
pick
up
another

in

should
i
maybe
get
an

one
of

size
to
accomodate
my
likely
passenger
if
your
primary
concern
is
protecting
the
passenger
in
the
event

a

have
him
or
her
fitted
for
a
helmet
that
is
their
size
if
your
primary
concern
is
complying
with
stupid
helmet
laws
carry
a
real
big
spare
you
can
put
a
big
or
small
head
in
a
big
helmet
but
not
in
a
small
one
while
shopping
for
a
passenger
helmet
i
noticed
that
in
many
cases
the
external
dimensions
of
the
helmets
were
the
same
from
s
through
xl
the
difference
was
the
amount
of
inside
padding
my
solution
was
to
buy
a
large
helmet
and
construct
a
removable
liner
from
a
sheet
of
closedcell
foam
and
some
satin
glued
to
the
inside
surface
the
result
is
a
reasonably
snug
fit
on
my
smallestheaded
pillion
with
the
liner
in
and
a
comfortable
fit
on
my
largestheaded

i
upgraded
to
an

parked
it

throwing

have

want

clean
up
the
i
tried
starting
it
with
someone
elses
battery
and
had
no

my
first
guess
is
that
it
is
the
gas
and
so
i
plan
on
draining
it
and
replacing
it
with
new
gas
i
can
only
pray
that
i
didnt
trash

is
what
do

do

i

concentrate

you

a

ease
off

pulling
in

eliminate
this
its

work

your

will
appreciate
it
also
ive
found
that
using
more
rear

than
normal
helps
keep
the

from
diving
as
much
during
routine
stops
which
makes
it
much
easier
for
the
passenger
to
hang
on
if
youre
going
sport
riding
have
the
passenger
reach
around
you
and
brace
themselves
against
the

so
you
dont

the

not

the
bit
condemning
everthing
the
flamee
might
ever
say
the
non
sequitur
about
guns
and
helmets
is
just
the
proper
flourish
i
personally
am
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
two
types
of
good
flames
the
first
does
trade
quality
in
the
sense
you
mention
for
heat
this
has
a
certain
surprise
value
and
if
done
correctly
which
i
contend
was
done
above
is
reasonably
entertaining
while
it
is
true
that
the
flame
i
posted
does
not
mention
anyones
habitual
velocity
friends
dinner
or
entertainment
it
says
what
it
needs
to
with
the
appropriate
flair
and
it
is
short
the
weakness
of
this
type
of
flame
is
actually
that
it
can
easily
be
taken
too
far
at
which
point
it
becomes
trite
and
boring
witness
the
infante
thread
recently
the
other
type
of
flame
which
you
seem
to
be
glorifying
above
has
a
few
weaknesses
as
well
in
the
first
place
it
can
get
verbose
and
tedious
in
the
extreme
particularly
if
the
reader
does
not
already
strongly
identify
with
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
second
discussing
someones
personal
qualities
habits
and
so
forth
can
quickly
become
libelous
or
is
that
slanderous
i
can
never
remember
the
difference
this
leads
to
a
proliferation
of
lawyers
which
is
widely
regarded
as
a
bad
thing
finally
introducing
polysyllabic
words
is
problematic
i
cant
haul
my
big
dic
around
on
my
bike
and
it
would
be
bad
form
to
use
a
word
which
actually
turned
out
to
have
a
meaning
especially
one
which
ran
counter
to
my

he
has

you

doesnt

oh
bull
pucky

they
use
dogs
because
a
many
people
are
scared
shitless
of
them
and
b
because
of
the
nose
and
the
vision

hearing
without
their

the

is
so
much
meat
in

al
ittle

puckey
without

they
are
less
likely
to
be
controllable
without
the
use

which
would
kill
the

those
teeth
arent
very
much
good
with
an
arm
shoved
into
the
back
of
the
animals
throat
and
held
there
and
the
neck
is
not
ok

youve
disabled
the

mouth
and
given
up
use
of
your

to
do
so
how
bout
them
front
and
read
paws
and
the
fact
that
to
plug
up
that
mouth
youve
given
the
dog
the
advantage
of
balance
espcially
strong
neither
are
the
leg
joints
which
can
be
easily
snapped
or
the
skull
easily
crushed
on
even
the
largest
dogs
have
you
ever
tried
to
snap
leg
or
crush
the

of

such
as
a

without
the

its
not

wait
youve
got
your

shoved
in

you
lose
your

a

is
still
no

entirely
with
these
three
paragraphs
but
did
the
hurt
mike
study
make
any
distinction
between
an
ability
to
swerve
and
a
failure
mike
to
swerve
yes
it
was
specifically
the
ability
or
understanding
of
the
technique
which
was
absent
we
have
made
a
lot
of
progress
between
rider
education
and
responsibility
over
the
last
tentwenty
years
but
i
am
still
amazed
anytime
i
teach
an
erc
how
many
people
of
many
year
riding
experience
discover
countersteering
for
cornering
or
swerving
mike
everything
else
hard
braking
and
swerving
tend
to
be
mutually
exclusive
mike
manouvres
did
hurt
draw
any
conclusions
on
which
one
is
generally
mike
preferable
the
specific
recommandation
cited
in
the
hurt
study
was
that
a
formal
street
strategy
like
sipde
for
example
was
the
most
important
component
of
any
rider
education
curriculum
the
specific
skills
of
emergency
braking
cornering
and
swerving
must
be
taught
and
practiced
as
well
but
more
significant
was
that
of
rider
did
nothing
confronted
with
a
potential
accident
and
another
third
collided
or
fell
over
as
a
result
of
rider
error
the
choice
of
specific
maneuver
is
much
less
significant
to
the
outcome
than
early
detection
and
the
proper
execution
of
any
effective
countermeasure

subject
re
need
advice
for
riding
with
someone
on
pillion
a
few
random
thoughts
on
riding
with
a
passenger
theres
no
substitute
for
a
bike
with
sufficient
power
having
taken
passengers
very
occasionally
on
the
small
etc
bikes
i
used
to
ride
in
the
uk
it
was
hard
im
now
riding
a
and
thats
great
even
moving
from
my
freinds
i
was
riding
recently
this
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
neither
i
nor
my
regular
passengers
are
particularly
slimline
i
always
tell
passengers
stay
in
line
with
the
bike
on
corners
that
makes
their
movements
predictable
my
regular
passengers
both
tend
to
hold
either
the
rack
or
nothing
at
all
i
dont
really
like
having
a
passenger
hold
onto
me
except
for
short
periods
again
that
may
be
biased
by
the
fact
that
ive
had
a
couple
of
new
passengers
a
friend
recently
for
her
first
time
on
a
bike
who
hold
on
to
me
real
tight
making
any
kind
of
maneuvering
difficult
ive
also
discovered
that
on
longer
trips
i
prefer
a
passenger
who
moves
and
shifts
their
weight
a
bit
i
recently
took
a
work
collegue
to
a
meeting
about
a
hour
ride
and
he
sat
totally
still
the
whole
way
which
left
me
also
sitting
very
still
and
getting
a
sore
back

have

hawk

new
seat
review
unable
to
stand
the
pain
anymore
my
wife
bought
the
corbin
gunfighter
and
lady
with
passenger
backrest
for
my
hawk
gt
it
came
with
no
instructions
but
it
came
weeks
earlier
than
they
said
it
would
installation
would
have
been
very
easy
but
the
seat
fastening
hardware
was
apparently
always
on
the
wrong
sides
with
the
stock
seat
it
never
was
easy
to
put
on
once
i
figured
that
out
the
new
seat
went
on
the
first
try
the
passenger
backrest
though
does
not
fit
as
i
thought
it
might
the
supplied
screw
to
set
the
backrest
angle
does
not
fit
and
i
have
not
yet
found
a
suitable
hard
sae
grade
or
perhaps
bolt
that
fits
there
is
a
a
soft
bolt
in
there
now
just
dont
lean
back
the
drivers
section
of
the
seat
is
a
bit
wider
seems
comfortable
enough
but
then
again
i
put
about
miles
on
the
stock
seat
without
a
thought
the
passengers
section
has
about
times
the
volume
of
foam
that
the
stock
seat
has
and
from
my
short
test
it
seems
much
more
comfortable
the
backrest
helps
a
bit
but
ive
not
has
enough
time
to
really
test
it
the
backrest
also
comes
with
a
small
pocket
its
now
more
difficult
to
swing
my
leg
up
over
the
taller
seat
if
i
go
on
the
threenotch

they
are
theres
a

the

do

at

one
anyway
it
is
a
little
known
fact
that
a
dog
will
involuntarily
regurgitate
and
release
an
object
that
is
too
large
to
swallow
i
was
told
that
if
i
were
ever
attacked
by
a
dog
i
should
ball
my
hand
in
a
fist
and
force
it
down
the
dogs
throat
the
dog
would
naturally
gag
and
release
and
become
momentarily
disoriented
this
commonly
happens
to
humans
when
we
go
to
a
doctor
and
have
our
throats
examined
proof
positive
in
the
time
during
the
dogs
disorientation
the
next
move
would
be
to
wrap
an
arm
about
the
dog
throat
in
a
choke
hold
manner
and
constrict
with
all
your
might
until
the
dog
lapses
into
unconsciousness
from
lack
of
oxygen
and
halting
blood
flow

run
like

wind

volvo

i

long
riding

at

sitting

volvo
in

no

no

nothing
we
were

i
was

the
cage
in

me
about
sec
back
well
as
said
cage
passes
the
volvo
the

dead

tm
behind
the

decides
that
she
doesnt
need
to
wait
for
me
to
pass
also
and
turns
out
perpendicular
across
both
lanes
of
traffic
so
that
she
can
turn
around
so
i
get
on
the
brakes
in
a

not
tbone
it
and
the
horn
in
an

wake
the

two

questions
hello
folks
im
very
happy
with
my
new
my
range
is
miles
on
gallons
thats
mpg
surprisingly
the
bike
is
a
real
cruiser
i
was
expecting
something
rough
shes
a
sweet
backroad
honey
and
i
can
go
pretty
much
anyplace
id
take
my
mountain
bike
as
far
as
shaft
effect
its
more
a
torque
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a
bit
maybe
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
buffeting
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequence
okay
here
are
my
questions
any
recommendations
for
a
homemade
fairing
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhaps
my
helmet
for
comfort
at
highway
speeds
mph
yet
dont
want
to
a
screw
up
the
stability
or
b
block
my
vision
too
much
for
trail
riding
anybody
have
luck
with
twopiece
detachible
fairings
id
like
to
make
it
myself
out
of
plexiglas
i
run
two
lights
the
standard
headlamp
plus
a
sidelamp
mounted
on
the
crash
bar
the
illuminations
excellent
that
way
with
a
full
beam
coming
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumination
from
left
to
right
and
it
really
picks
up
the
periphery
deer
lurking
etc
combined
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
alternators
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
puttering
around
in
the
dirt
at
low
rpm
this
is
embarassing
im
having
trouble
starting
the
bike
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
invariably
flood
the
carbs
then
go
in
and
read
a
section
of
the
paper
and
then
she
starts
right
up
is
this
a
zen
thing
the
haynes
manual
says
do
not
under
any
circumstances
use
gasoline
with
alcohol
additives
yeah
right
what
do
you
folks
due
to
keep
the
engine
and
carbs
from
being
eaten
by
ethanol
and
methanol
any
particular
brands
of

that
are

one

had

a

of
time
practicing
bizzare
tricks
on
his
megabuckmicromass

he
said
he
once
repelled
a
dog
attack
by
picking
up
the
rear
of
the
bike
and
smacking
the
dog
in
the
side
of
the
head
with
the
rear
wheel
the
dog
had
no
idea
what
hit
him
and
he
fled
quite
rapidly
then
again
he
could
jump
garbage
cans
without
a
ramp
so
i
dont
think
id
care
to
try
this
one
on

worked

the

well
over

the

had
started
out
at

when
it
heard
me
and
still
had
a

when
it
hit
the

the

was
approaching
from

was
running
full

to
get
to
my

noggin
careening
off
the

smacking

well
as
many
a

the
way

to
push
your

you
want

turn
left
you
push
your

to

this
you
have
to

the
only
thing
to
push
against
is
the
ground
through
the

well
the
apple
guy
wozniak
or
was
that
churchill
says
that
the
ground
will
push
you
right
back
so
you
pushed
yourself
off
to
the
left
by
pushing
on
the
ground
to
the
right
and
the
ground
pushed
back
toward
the
left
well
that
push
is
on
both

the

doesnt

on
the

which
had

the

has
trail
if
the

pushes
the

what

actually
i

dwi

driving

rather

at

it

ive

here
in

when
a
girl
went
to
court

won
her
case
by
claiming
to
be
stoned
on
pot
not
intoxicated
on

one
can
be
imparied
without
necessarily
being
impaired
by
liquor
drugs
not
enough

being

moron
all
can
impair
someone

im
surprised
this
got
her
off

perhaps
dwi

lets
just

it

re

nominating
statement
dear
chick
we
have
a
very
serious
problem
with
the
election
for
president
of
the
moa
this
year
cecil
kings
nominating
statement
as
it
appeared
in
the
owners
news
is
words
nearly
twice
as
many
as
that
is
permitted
by
the
bylaws
in
pertinent
part
the
rules
state
each
candidates
biography
and
position
statement
shall
be
limited
to
a
combined
total
of
no
more
than
words
the
nominating
committe
shall
cut
afafter
the
word
any
biography
and
position
statement
exceeding
this
length
obviously
the
nominationg
committe
was
not
up
to
the
task
had
cecils
statement
been
cut
as
required
it
would
have
concluded
approximately
with
the
word
undertiding
sic
in
the
second
paragraph
after
the
commencement
of
his
position
statement
as
a
result
cecil
has
obtained
what
i
view
as
a
grossly
unfair
advantage
over
the
other
candidates
for
president
this
does
not
just
taint
the
election
for
that
office
it
makes
a
mockery
of
the
process
i
would
appreciate
your
advising
the
board
immediately
what
steps
you
intend
to
take
to
rectify
this
caricature
of
a
fair
election
parenthetically
in
your
private

with

i
would
be
most
appreciative
that
when
tou
call

you
remind
the

recipient

the

its

like

a

for
what
its

i
got
my
can
in
three

from
chaparral
thats
ups
ground
from
ca
to
ut
ymmv
the
stuff
seems
to
work
and
it
doesnt
attract

like
blue
does
i
gave
it
the

a
full

if
theres
anything
wet
stickey
it
will
be
coated
with
sand
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
the
chain
looked
pretty
clean
as
far
as
mailorder
goes
if
chaparral
has
it
in
stock
and
they
can
tell
you
if
its
in
stock
or
about
how
long
it
will
take
to
backorder
it
if
its
not
i
usually
get
it
in
three
days
competition
accessories
always
seems
to
take
a
week
or
two
to
deliver
motorcycle
accessory
warehouse
also
takes
a
week
or
two
and
after
trying
to
buy
some
boots
from
them
last
week
i
dont
think
they
actually
stock
anything
maw
was
about
cheaper
than
chaparral
on
alpinestars
tech
boots
but
on
monday
i
was
hoping
to
get
them
by
the
end
of
the
week
so
i
asked
maw
a
completely
unreasonable
question
do
you
have
them
in
stock
the
conversation
went
something
like
this
i
need
to
know
if
you
have
some
boots
in
stock
do
you
want
to
pay
with
visa
or
mastercard
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
them
in
stock
well
the
computer
doesnt
show
anything
id
have
to
call
the
distributer
to
find
out
if
we
have
them
so
do
you
have
them
or
not
dont
you
understand
what
im
saying
i
have
to
call
our
distributer
to
find
out
if
we
have
them
in
stock
or
not
uh
right
so
can
you
do
it
yea
call
me
back
in
an
hour
and
ask
for
phil
so
an
hour
later
phil
isnt
there
but
mike
says
hell
check
and
call
him
back
in
half
an
hour
half
an
hour
later
mike
isnt
there
either
but
he
left
a
note
that
says
theyll
have
them
by
the
end
of
the
month
weeks
away
screw
it
the
bucks
isnt
worth
the
hassle
i
called
chaparral
and
asked
if
they
had
them
in
stock
ooh
alpinestars
probably
not
they
are
hard
to
keep
in
stock
but
ill
check

i
like
chaparral
im
not
completely
down

they
often

lower
prices
but
be
prepared
to
wait
oh
and

in
my

not

discussion

the
twist
you
feel

i
was
riding
the
purple
water
buffalo
i
jumped
an
intersection
in

of
a
cop
who
was
waiting
for
the
light
the
side
of
the
street
he
was
on
was
hidden
buy
a
building
on
the
corner
and
i
didnt
see
him
till
i
was
airborne
in
the
middle
of
the
intersection
i
was
parked
had
my
helment
off
and
my
liscence
out
before
he
turned
the
corner
he
chewed
my
ass
out
and
let
me
go
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
it
was
a
very
squidly
thing
to
do
jumping
the
intersection
like
that
the
cop
should
have
nailed
me
i
find
that
if
you
are
polite
respectfull
and
honest
they
will
normaly
let
you
get
away

eaa
near

wisconsin
although
approximately
people
were

there
was
not
a

anywhere
everyone
was
considerate
enough
to
place
their
trash
where
it

theres
no

the

that
didnt

mentioned
that
when

was

the

is
do

they
do
this

that

a
need
for
a
bmw
list
as
opposed
to
just
a
gs
boxer
list
my
motivation
for
setting
up
the
bmw
list
came
from
an
earlier
post
of
yours
announcing
your
boxer
list
it
didnt
fit
my

ok
weve
pissed
on
each
others
list
lets
get
back
to
the
regular

our

by

a

wouldnt

needs
good
point
the

actually
started
out
as
an
extension
of
my
gs
v
fj

list
which
is
why
it
got
that
name
since
inception
however
other
boxerinterested
folks
have
joined
and
the
conversation
has
not
always
been
geared
to
gspdstspecific
topics
for
the
sake
of
not
forcing
the
split
issue
how
about
changing
the
charter
and
renaming
your

from
bmwgs
to
just
bmw
would
that
make
everybody
happy
when
i
raised
the
to
expand
or
not
to
expandthat
is
the
question
question
on
the
list
itself
there
were
mixed
feelings
the
list
has
always
been
open
to
anyone
with
a
nonbouncing
from
line
and
there
has
been
general
agreement
that
only
boxerrelated
stuff
is
appropriate
almost
all
of
the
subscribers
own
gsstpd
bikes
although
some
r
rt
and
rs
owners
are
also
on
it
at
this
point
my
main
interest
for
the
list
is
to
preserve
the
peace
and
comraderie
while
at
the
same
time
providing
as
wide
access
as
possible
the
list
is
fairly
technical
with
how
do
i
do
this
what
kind
of
that
should
i
get
kinds
of
questions
there
has
yet

are
by

of

if

would

then
i
am
not
going
to
stand
in
the
way
of
progress
so
hesh
let
me
turn
the
question
around
have
you
or
has
anyone

you

the

are

arent
noticably
different
from
normal
grips
in

my
only
complaint

that
the

setting
might
as
well
be
off
this
has
been
complained
about
by
every
reviewer
official
and
unofficial
thats
ever
talked
about
these
grips
the
high
setting
is
often
too
high
for
use
with
lightweight
summer
gloves
when
things
just
get
a
bit
nippy
but
since
low
doesnt
produce
a
noticable
effect
i
end
up
turning
the
grips
on
and
off
to
keep
the
temperature
about
right
this
generally
isnt
a
problem
when
wearing
thicker
winter
gloves
when
i
asked
the
dealer
if
they
could
fix
it
i
received
a
consoling
pat
on
the
back
and
their
sincere
apologies
for
the
poor
design
actually
i
was
told
they
worked
just

you
not
if

own
a
typical
standard
or

bike
with
fairly
average
mirrors
that
screw
into

your

should
fit
over

and
be
fairly
stable
be
careful
that
you
do
not
have
any
weight
of
the

resting

it

depress
the

in

that
is
not
the
kind
of
foam
that
bounces
back
like
foam
rubber
its
purpose
in

is
to
absorb
energy
in
an

as
it
is
compressed
by
your

if
your

compresses
it

is
that

absorbing

all
of
us
that
argue

the
technique
of
countersteering
including
all
the
ones
who
think
that
they
countersteer
all
the
way
through
a
corner
well
all
the
way
through

corner
anyway
this
is
really
the
only
thing
we
disagree
on
maybe
we
should
agree
to
disagree
ok
but
im
right
the
official
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubts
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
applied
first
followed
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
being
that
you
avoid
locking
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
takes
place
if
thats
the
official
line
taught
in
those
rider
education
classes
you
were
refering
to
that
also
dont
teach
countersteering
i
have
to
question
the
quality
of
the
classes
the
official
line
in
msf
curricula
is
as
i
described
maximum
braking
is
achieved
by
applying
both
brakes
equally
when
the
weight
distribution
is
nominally
even
and
both
tires
have
equal
normal
forces
and
easing
off
on
the
rear
to
prevent
locking
it
and
increasing
braking
on
the
front
as
more
traction
is
available
to
the
front
due
to
increased
normal
force
due
to
weight
shift
the
official
line
you
have
been
taught
seems
ineffective
on
the
face
of
it
applying
the
rear
brake
after
the
front
is
not
taking
advantage
of
all
the
traction
available
to
the
rear
at
time
and
is
halving
the
available
braking
power
by
using
only
the
front
at
time
saying
brake
until
the
tire
just
begins
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advice
to
a
newbie
he
has
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
gives
him
zero
information
from
which
to
develop
a
braking
technique
that
changes
as
the
braking
and
corresponding
weight
shift
develop
if
you
dont
slide
the
tyre
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
youve
achieved
maximum
braking
or
not
im
not
suggesting
that
you
should
always
aim
to
brake
as
hard
as
you
possibly
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limits
of
the
machine
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
not
necessarily
true
chirping
the
tire
indicates
impending
lockup
on
most
surfaces
and
serves
as
a
good
guide
to
newbies
to
indicate
maximum
braking
i
agree
that
totally
locking
the
front
occasionally
makes
one
a
better
rider
but
it
is
a
manuver
best
saved
for
an
experienced
rider
unless
you
have
one
of
those
outrigger
bikes
like
code
used
to
use
in
any
case
for
maximum
braking
if
as
i
suggested
you
aim
to
keep
both
wheels
just
on
the
point
of
sliding
then
youll
be
doing
exactly
as
you
suggest
true
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
how
to
best
teach
riding
skills
which
is
how
this
discussion
started
keep
both
wheels
just
on
the
point
of
sliding
is
nearly
useless
information

need
to

a
strategy

anticipated

tried
to
always
look

move

to

acceleration
can

unnerving

dog
attack
my
previous
posting
on
dog
attacks
must
have
generated
some
bad
karma
or
something
ive
weathered
attempted
dog
attacks
before
using
the
approved
method
slow
down
to
screw
up
dogs
triangulation
of
target
then
take
off
and
laugh
at
the
dog
now
far
behind
you
this
time
it
didnt
work
because
i
didnt
have
time
riding
up
the
hill
leading
to
my
house
i
encountered
a
liverandwhite
springer
spaniel
no
relation
to
the
springer
softail
or
the
springer
spagthorpe
a
close
relation
to
the
spagthorpe
viking
actually
the
dog
encountered
me
with
intent
to
harm
but
i
digress
i
was
riding
near
the
unpainted
centerline
of
the
roughly
wide
road
doing
between
forty
and
sixty
clicks
mph
for
the
velocityimpaired
the
dog
shot
at
me
from
behind
bushes
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
at
an
impossibly
high
speed
i
later
learned
he
had
been
accelerating
from
the
front
porch
about
thirty
feet
away
heading
down
the
very
gently
sloped
approach
to
the
side
of
the
road
i
saw
the
dog
and
before
you
could
say
sipde
he
was
on
me
boom
i
took
the
dog
in
the
left
leg
and
from
the
marks
on
the
bike
my
leg
was
driven
up
the
side
of
the
bike
with
considerable
force
making
permanent
marks
on
the
plastic
parts
of
the
bike
and
cracking
one
panel
i
think
i
saw
the
dog
spin
around
when
i
looked
back
but
my
memory
of
this
moment
is
hazy
i
next
turned
around
and
picked
the
most
likely
looking
house
the
apologetic
woman
explained
that
the
dog
was
not
seriously
hurt
cut
mouth
and
hoped
i
was
not
hurt
either
i
could
feel
the
pain
in
my
shin
and
expected
a
cool
purple
welt
to
form
soon
sadly
it
has
not
so
im
left
with
a
tender
shin
and
no
cool
battle
scars
interestingly
the
one
thing
that
never
happened
was
that
the
bike
never
moved
off
course
the
not
inconsiderable
impact
did
not
push
the
bike
off
course
nor
did
it
cause
me
to
put
the
bike
out
of
control
from
some
gut
reaction
to
the
sudden
impact
delayed
pain
may
have
helped
me
here
as
i
didnt
feel
a
sudden
sharp
pain
that
i
can
remember
what
worries
me
about
the
accident
is
this
i
dont
think
i
could
have
prevented
it
except
by
traveling
much
slower
than
i
was
this
is
not
necessarily
an
unreasonable
suggestion
for
a
residential
area
but
i
was
riding
around
the
speed
limit
i
worry
about
what
would
have
happened
if
it
had
been
a
car
instead
of
a
dog
but
i
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
would
take
a
truly
insane
bdi
cager
to
whip
out
of
a
blind
driveway
at
mph
for
that
matter
how
many
driveways
are
long
enough
for
a
car
to
hit
mph
by
the
end

guzzi
tires
plus
fairing
question
i
have
a
question
about
tires
for
my
guzzi
it
is
a
the
tires
that
were
on
it
when
i
just
bought
it
are
old
and
cracked
i
do
not
have
an
owners
manual
for
it
yet
but
the
tires
listed
in
the
haynes
manual
are
front
h
rear
h
and
pressures
recommended
are
front
and
rear
oddly
the
pressure
for
the
same
tire
on
the
is
listed
at
psi
instead
anyone
know
the
reason
as
i
know
though
the
pressure
i
should
run
at
is
that
recommended
by
the
manufacturer
of
the
new
tires
i
purchase
the
real
question
i
have
is
this
the
old
tires
that
are
on
the
bike
are
for
the
front
a
metzler
touring
special
h
and
for
the
rear
an
avon
roadrunner
h
h
as
marked
on
each
tire
both
are
larger
than
that
listed
in
the
haynes
manual
what
does
the
owners
manual
recommend
and
was
it
common
to
go
up
one
size
for
this
bike
also
this
will
be
my
first
motorcycle
with
innertubes
any
comments
on
the
various
manufacturers
inner
tube
qualities
the
above
sizes
are
inches
except
for
the
additional
mark
on
the
current
rear
tire
what
is
the
best
metric
match
the
local
bmw
dealer
thought
h
on
the
front
and
h
on
the
back
he
also
happens
to
be
very
good
at
getting
close
to
matching
mail
order
prices
i
am
thinking
of
going
with
a
metzler
laser
possibly
comp
k
on
the
front
and
on
the
back
both
in
mbs
variety
if
possible
the
longer
lasting
belting
system
i
already
use
the
on
both
the
vision
and
fj
for
the
front
and
like
it
and
i
thought
that
with
the
shaft
drive
behavior
and
torque
from
the
guzzi
that
the
might
give
more
predictable
back
end
control
and
sliding
behavior
than
a
might
as
well
as
giving
much
better
tire
milage
life
any
comments
a
friend
told
me
he
thought
that
my
bike
had
boranni
rims
which
are
very
good
but
are
relatively
soft
and
have
delicate
sidewalls
i
do
not
wish
to
mount
the
tires
myself
this
first
time
so
aside
from
warning
the
shop
to
be
careful
any
other
comments
i
should
make
i
havnt
looked
at
the
rim
to
check
out
the
make
yet
if
it
is
marked
he
just
told
me
late
yesterday
and
i
havnt
had
a
chance
to
check
the
rim
type
on
another
note
i
will
remove
the
ugly
but
in
good
shapeanyone
want
it
vetter
fairing
and
i
will
run
without
a
windscreen
for
a
while
but
eventually
i
would
like
a
simple
rounded
cafe
style
quarter
fairing
for
it
it
could
be
forkhandlebar
mounted
any
suggestions
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
frame
mounted
quarter
fairing
of
the
cafe
style
for
this
bike
how
about
lower
barsclipons
for
it
i
would
like
to
restore
the
bike
into
a
good
condition
runner
with
a
few
modern
updates
but
while
not
being
historically
exactly
accurate
still
have
it
reflect
relatively
well
a
representation
of
the
cafe
style
yes
i
know
to
be
picky
that
period
really
predates
this
bikeit
is
just
that
this
bike
has
such
potential
for
that
look

earlier
i
was
reading
on
the
net
about
using
splitfire
plugs
one
guy
was
thinking
about
it
and
almost
everybody
shot
him
to
hell
well
i
saw
one
think
that
someone
said
about
show
me
a
team
that
used
split
fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
now
i
dont
know
about
all
of
this
and
im
trying
to
catch
up
with
somebody
about
it
now
but
splitfires
should
help
twins
more
than
splitfires
work
mainly
by
providing
a
moreorless
unshrouded
spark
to
the
combustion
chamber
if
an
engines
cylinder
head
design
can
benefit
from
this
then
the
splitfires
will
yield
a
slight
performance
increase
most
noticeably
in
lower
rpm
range
torque
splitfires
didnt
do
diddlysquat
for
my
gmc
pickup
but
do
give
a
noticeable
performance
boost
in
my
harley
sportster
and
my
best
friends
sportster
folks
i
know
whove
tried
them
in
evo
motors
cant
tell
any
performance
boost
over
plain
plugs
which
is
interesting
since
the
xlh
and
big
twin
evo
combustion
chambers
are
pretty
much
the
same
shape
just
different
sizes
two
of
my
friends
who
have
shovelhead
harleys
swear
by
the
splitfires
but
if
i
had
a
shovelhead
id
dualplug
it
instead
since
they
respond
well
enough
to
dual
plugs
to
make
the
machine
work
and
extra
ignition
system
worth
the
expense
plus
they
look
really
cool
with
a
spark
plug
on

side

each

or
a
twopiece

like
most
everyone

i
ended
up
getting
two
different
sizes
for
the
top
and
bottom
my
top
is
a
and
the
bottom
is
a
for
the
bottom
the
waist
is
far
too
large
but
the
thighs
fit
just
right
the
had
a
better
waist
but
cut
off
the
circulation
in
my
legs
i
have
large
muscular
thighs
and
no
i
didnt
use
the
thighmaster
to
get
them
the
jacket
fits
me
ok
in
the
chest
slightly
snug
at
the
waist
and
too
small
in
the
arms
i
cant
imagine
finding
a
onepiece
size
that
would
have
fit
correctly
as
even
the
piece
has
its
problems
strange
since
my
vpilot
jacket
fits
great
all
over
and
when
i
tried
the
matching
pants
they
fit
like
a
glove
as
well
i
can
only
assume
the
models
aero
design
uses
to
design
its
suits
are
in
some
way
different
from
us
real
folks
also
even
though
its
related
to
convienience
you
look
pretty
damn
wierd
walking
around
with
the
tops
and
bottoms
while
running
errands
ive
gotten
some
really
suspicious
looks
and
sweated
a
lot
while
in
a
store
wearing
the
whole
suit
since
you
cant
fit
the
top
and
bottom
in
any
motorcycle
storage
device
yet
devised
except
the
trunk
in
my
sidecar
rig
with
the
two
piece
i
unzip
the
pants
i
generally
leave
the
two
pieces
zipped
together
primarily
because
the
pants
fall
down
unless
i
pull
the
cheesy
elastic
belttype
band
real
tight
stuff
them
in
one
of
my
spacious
bmw
saddlebags
the
pants
just
fit
and
run
errands
just
wearing
the
jacket
actually
if
i
know
ill
be
running
errands
i
just
wear
my
vpilot
jacket
but
thats
just
me
as
far
as
crash
protection
id
say
that
both
suits
are
probably
equal
it
seems
that
for
weather
protection
if
anything
the
piece
provides
a
little
more
because
of
the
jacket
overlapping
the
pants
by
inches
the
piece
is
probably
a
little
less
comfortable
around
the
waist
just
because
of
the
extra
layer
of
stuff
but
maybe
not
so
id
have
to
vote
for
the
two
piece
despite
the
slightly
odd
fit
i
still
find
the
suit
the
most
versatile
piece
of
riding
clothing
i
own
wouldnt
go
long
distance
without

black
reflector
tape
a
few
months
ago
in
one
the
the
motorcycle
mags
there
was
an
article
that
mentioned
reflector
tape
that
was
supposed
to
be
available
thru
bmw
the
idea
was
that
the
tape
would
look
black
in
sunlight
and
reflect
in
other
colors
at
night
to
headlights
it
sounded
like
a
nice
way
to
add
nighttime
visibility
without
turning
the
bike
into
a
carnival
attraction
i
talked
to
the
local
bmw
dealer
about
this
i
was
told
that
the
only
thing
he
had
heard
about
this
kind
of
reflector
was
it
being
used
in
a
coming
line
of
bmw
clothing
rainsuits
he
wasnt
aware
of
anything
regarding
self
applied
tape
has
anyone
come

this
from

any

the

who
picked
the
weather
for
today
went
up
to
visit
a
friend
overnight
about
minute
ride
rode
up
after
work
only
minor
drizzing
for
the
last
minutes
of
the
ride
rest
of
the
ride
was
very
zen
got
up
this
morning
needed
to
go
home
and
get
some
disks
stuff
to
work
on
her
computers
with
rainy
as
all
hell
soaked
and
cold
by
the
time
i
got
home
since
i
didnt
have
another
set
of
thermals
which
were
dry
i
said
to
heck
with
it
and
drove
my
cage
back
up
lo
and
behold
those
funny
blue
clouds
were
up
in
the
sky
and
this
warm
yellow
thing
i
havent
seen
in
quite
awhile
showed
up
when
i
was
minutes
into
the
trip
and
me
in
my
cage
oh
joy
happily
my
right
hand
mirror
finally
showed
up
at
the
dealer
dropped
the
bike
when
i
first
got
it
put
on
an
emgo
replacement
mirror
hated
it
the
entire
time
that
thing
was
on
my
bike
because
i
couldnt
see
a
damned
thing
through
it
plus
its
flat
instead
of
convex
like
the
stock
mirrors
so
you
get
a
narrow
angle
wobbly
blur
and
i
got
a
replacement
windshield
for
my
fairing
dropped
the
original
and
chipped
the
front
edge
cosmetic
but
annoying
so
i
spent
half
an
hour
happily
unscrewing
things
and
replacing
them
this
afternoon
bout
the
only
thing
i
still
hate
about
the

is

anyone
seen

halogen
passing

a
its
simple
first
it
has
to
be
the
first
really
nice
riding
day
of
spring
the
bike
is
back
together
again
and
so
are
you
grab
all
your
gear
put
it
on
and
fill
the
tank
with
octane
premium
or
better
head
out
in
ames
there
is
a
road
that
leads
to
the
little
town
of
gilbert
gilbert
has
one
stop
light
if
that
tells
you
something
having
just
gotten
the
bike
back
together
i
thought
id
take
it
for
a
short
ride
and
check
things
out
heading
out
of
town
i
went
into
the
twisties
at
a
slow
pace
just
under
the
speed
limit
and
started
leaning
around
the
pace
quickened
as
everything
felt
just
right
finally
the
road
straightened
and
i
was
ready
for
a
bit
of
speed
grab
third
gear
open
her
up
at
roughly
grab
fourth
gear
look
at
as
much
of
the
bike
as
you
can
and
fail
to
notice
a
state
trooper
following
a
quarter
mile
behind
twist
the
throttle
like
a
fool
grab
fifth
gear
at
or
so
and
see
just
how
well
shes
been
put
back
together
at
according
to
radar
i
noticed
the
front
fender
was
flexing
a
bit
thus
i
slowed
pulled
off
the
road
removed
my
helmet
and
gloves
unslung
the
took
kit
i
was
carrying
in
a
fanny
pack
and
was
just
starting
to
tighten
that
fender
when
the
trooper
pulled
in
all
hot
and
flustered
have
you
any
idea
how
fast
you
were
going
not
precisely
no
i
was
paying
attention
to
the
bike
and
road
not
the
instruments
i
just
got
her
back
together
last
night
and
im
just
out
here
testing
her
out
before
i
ride
it
in
traffic
my
radar
says
you
were
at
over
care
to
tell
me
why
i
shouldnt
give
you
a
ticket
because
i
was
testing
the
motorcycle
away
from
population
and
traffic
on
a
strait
and
flat
road
while
wearing
all
the
protective
gear
that
safety
demands
note
i
wasnt
quite
that
eloquent
say
what
kind
of
bike
is
that
anyway
i
was
eloquent
on
my
cafe
racer
replica
honda
a
rat
bike
yeah
i
havent
had
my
bike
out
of
the
garage
in
years
compare
riding
stories
pack
toolkit
having
tightened
that
fender
so
why
were
you
out
here
i
figure
every
other
idiot
on
the
road
is
going
to
look
right
through
me
if
the
bike
fails
somehow
in
a
zone
im
dead
if
it
holds
up
out
here
then
i
know
it
will
work
right
in

i
do
this
evvery
year
when
i
rebuild
her
not
any
more
youll
find
a
better
place
than
my
highway
to
do
those
speeds
if
i
ever
catch
you
speeding
on
my
highway
again
im
going
to
nail
you
for
everything
i
possibly
can
now
get
out

my

i
write
you

this

is
lbs
and
fairly

so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
my
fiancee
and
i
do
quite
a
bit
of
sporty
riding
ill
tell
you
what
weve
found
and
the
systems
weve
worked
out
on
starts
accelerate
much
slower
than
usual
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
acceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
remember
this
on
turns
have
her
lean
forward
and
at
the
same
angle
as
you
normally
this
means
she
isnt
leaning
at
all
its
very
disconcerting
to
be
leaned
over
and
have
your
passenger
leaning
so
that
theyre
sitting
straight
up
much
balance
is
lost
and
this
can
be
dangerous
on
slowing
and
stopping
do
so
much
slower
than
usual
again
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
deceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
however
youll
figure
it
out
fast
because
braking
too
fast
will
shove
the
passenger
forward
into
you
which
shoves
you
into
the
tank
at
an
inopportune
location
generally
have
the
passenger
keep
her
knees
against
you
and
the
bike
not
out
wide
this
helps
balance
and
gives
her
somegrip
when
you
passenger
is
in
fear
she
will
squeeze
her
knees
against
you
normally
this
means
slow
down
and
do
it
now
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
we
only
have
a
couple
signals
slow
down
is
her
either
tapping
me
on
the
back
or
slapping
my
helmet
with
all
her
might
depends
on
the
urgency
of
the
matter
turn
here
is
done
by
her
pointing
in
the
direction
of
an
exit
this
is
also
the
sign
for
cool
look
at
that
i
hafta
pee
is
the
same
sign
as
turn
here
im
hungry
is
the
same
sign
go
faster
is
usually
done
by
her
jumping
up
and
down
on
her
pegs
in
glee
i
usually
see
slow
down
more
often
than
go
faster
i
really
want
this
to
be
a
positive
experience
for
us
both
mainly
so
that
shell
want
to
go
with
me
again
so
any
help
will
be
appreciated
the
best
thing
to
do
before
the
ride
is
to
talk
to
a
riding
buddy
and
pillion
on
his
or
her
bike
its
incredibly
frustrating
because
youre
in
almost
no
control
now
multiply
that
feeling
times
ten
because
you
as
a
rider
know
what
your
bike
will
do
and
your
passenger
will
likely
feel
youre
about
to
scrape
hard
parts
all
the
time
or
lock
up
the
brakes
at
any
moment
or
go
careening
off
the
edge
of
a
volcanic
mountain
etc
pillioning
yourself
is
good
training
to
take
somebody
on
your
pillion
pad
also
remember
that
its
much
more
draining
and
tiring
to
ride
than
by
yourself
because
youre
concentrating

of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
if
the
ninja
has
adjustable
suspension
adjust
it
to
a
stiffer
setting
so
you
dont
bottom
out
in
bumpy
curves
tell
her
the
cardinal
rules
are
a
never
ever
ever
ever
put
her
feet
down
not
when
you
stop
at
a
stop
sign
not
when
she
thinks
youre
gonna
crash
never
keep
them
on
the
pegs
until
you
tell
her
to
get
off
the
bike
b
she
is
to
hold
onto
your
waist
she
should
hold
on
tightly
enough
that
she
wont
slide
off
the
bike
if
you
twist
the
throttle
a
bit
and
added
bonus
for
you
here
she
should
keep
as
close
to
your
butt
as
possible
so
quick
stops
dont
make
her
slide
into
you
and
knock
your
balls
up
onto
the
gas
tank
you
decide
how
best
to
word
this
c
just
stay
perpendicular
to
the
bike
straight
up
in
the
seat
dont
lean
your
body
into
curves
just
go
with
the
bike
and
stay
perpendicular
dont
look
over
your
shoulder
remember
at
all
times
that
you
have
a
passenger
on
the
back
that
means
dont
pop
the
clutch
and
try
to
corner
and
stop
smoother
than
usual
be
aware
that
if
you
jump
on
the
brake
youre
going
to
have
the
equivalent
of
a
lb
dead
weight
crashing
into
you
from
behind
so
be
prepared
for
that
make
sure
she
pisses
before
the
ride
even
if
she
says
she
doesnt
have
to
go
no
antiwomen
stuff
here
i
have
a
tiny
bladder
myself
remind
her
to
look
around
while
youre
riding
point
to
things
of
interest
it
makes
the
ride
more
enjoyable
to
her
she
wont
get
so
focused
on
just
looking
at
the
back
of
your
helmet
and
it
gives
her
ample
excuse
to
squeeze
you
to
show
she
saw
what
you
pointed
at
my
wife
and
i
tried
the
msfrecommended
look
over
the
riders
shoulder
in
curves
bit
and
it
just
didnt
work
the
timing
of
her
weight
shift
was
unpredictable
especially
on
the
maxim
because
unlike
the
ninja
the
upright
riding
position
really
restricts
the
pillions
view
of
the
road
ahead
next
time
i
had
her
just
remain
perpendicular
to
the
bike
and
i
could
hardly
tell
there
was
someone
else
on
the
bike
in
curves
and
she
weighs
substantially

lbs

i
have
the

locks
on

the

i
took
possesion
of
a
cobra
links
lock
diameter
this
was
a
special
order
i
weighs
a
lot
i
had
to
carry
it
home
and
it
was
digging
into
my
shoulder
after
about
two
blocks
i
have
currently
a
kryptonite
rock
lock
through

front
wheel
a

padlock
for
the
steering
lock
a
master
padlock
to
lock
the
cover
to
two

and
the
cobra
links
through
the
rear
swing
arm
and
around
a
post
in
an
underground

garage
next
friday
the
i
have
an
appointment
to
have
an

installed
on

bike
when
i
travel
the
cobra
links
and
the
cover
and

stay
at

by
the
way
i
also
removed
the
plastic
mesh
that
is
on
the
cobra
links
and
encased
the
lock
from
end
to
end
using
bicycle
inner
tubes
two
of
them
i
got
the
from
bicycle
dealer
that
sold
me
the
cobra
links
the
guys
were
really
great
and
didnt
mark
up
the

of
the
lock
much

were

extraordinary

okay
doders
heres
a
goddamn
mystery
for
ya
today
i
was
turning
a
degree
corner
just
like
on
any
other
day
but
there
was
a
slight
difference
a
rough
spot
right
in
my
path
caused
the
suspension
to
compress
in
mid
corner
and
some
part
of
the
bike
hit
the
ground
with
a
very
tangible
thunk
i
pulled
over
at
first
opportunity
to
sus
out
the
damage
my
bike
is
a
kawasaki
with
footpegs
that
are
hinged
and
sprung
such
that
they
fold
upward
and
backward
on
contact
with
ground
etc
and
on
the
lower
extreme
corner
of
each
peg
there
is
mounted
a
bankfollower
or
a
little
stud
that
theoretically
is
the
first
bit
to
hit
the
ground
in
a
turn
the
stud
is
mounted
on
the
footpeg
by
a
threaded
bit
about
mm
long
which
screws
into
a
threaded
hole
in
the
footpeg
now
for
the
mystery
the
stud
on
the
side
of
the
bike
that
clunked
when
i
turned
was
absent
im
fairly
sure
it
was
there
before
the
event
there
was
no
damage
to
the
end
of
the
footpeg
where
the
stud
would
ordinarily
have
been
in
fact
the
thread
in
the
hole
in
the
footpeg
was
perfectly
intact
with
no
evidence
of
something
having
been
forcefully
ripped
out
of
it
only
moments
previously
okay
all
you
engineering
types
how
the
fk
do
you
explain
this
how
can
you
rip
a
tightly
fitting
steel
thread
out
of
a
threaded
hole
in
alloy
without
damaging
the
thread
in
the
hole
is
this
some
sort
of
hitech
design
thingo
that
kawasaki
never
mentioned
like
that
the
end
of
the
footpeg
suddenly
changes
phase
on
impact
to
let
the
stud
rip
out
then
changes
back
to
a
solid

quite
amazed

take
your

tuesday
morning
i
spent
a

been
working

brazing
bits

metal
over

in

exhaust
pipes
smazin
what
you
can
do
with

i
stuck
some
gungum
into

smaller
holes
and
bunged
the
pipes
back
onto
the
bike
so
last
night
im
on
the
way
home
when
lo
an
bloody
behold
the
sodding
thing
starts
blowing
again
i
check
it
out
and
the
gas
is
escaping
from
around
the
clamp
holding
the
number
two
pipe
into
the
port
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
being
somewhat
hole
of
calcutta
at
the
time
the
nuts
are
still
there
stop
that
bloody
sniggering
you
at
the
back
but
the
pipe
is
a
bit
loose
this
morning
i
go
out
to
the
bike
and
pull
out
the
socketset
to
tighten
up
me
nuts
somebody
give
that
spotty

at

a

round
the

and
lo

would

someone
i

i
try

it
took
a

tries

get
the

squish
but
its
been
fine
for
about
years

i

it

otoh
i
tried
this

thursday

really
i
just
made
a

really
is
was
your

the
nyloncoil
type

the
kind
with
molded
plastic
teeth
ive
only
tried
it
on
the
coiled
nylon
type
and
it
doesnt
take
much
squish
to
fix
the
problem
i
found
i
was
overdoing
it
no
broken
parts
but
the
zipper
was
too
hard
to
pull
so
after
spreading
the
zipper
pull
jaws
again
i
tried
with
vicegrips
no
not
the
usual
grip
of
death
technique
i
adjusted
the
closed
vicegrips
so
they
were
snug
on
the
zipper
jaws
then
released
them
and
tightened
the
adjusting
screw
a
bit
a
couple
of
iterations
and
i
had
just
the
right
amount
of
zipper
squish
tm
result
i
now
know
that
noplace

will
even

replacement
was
pretty
simple
just
break
and
remove
the
plastic
knob
at
the
top
of
the
zipper
that
keeps
the
pull
from
coming
off
the

slide

i

they

atrophied
by

many

tapping

at

there
was
only

i
reached
down

the
bludgeon
of
dire
necessity
if
ever
there
was
one
to
my
amazement

confusion
the

started
shaking
and
rolling
on
the

then
leapt
to
its
feet
and
vanished
down
the

still
quivering
and
occasionally
looking

i
exclaimed
flexing
my
newfound

brandishing
my
terrible

of

as
i
stalked
the

of
my

it
was
only
later
that
i
found
out
what
the

apparently
knew
all
along
the
wrench
was
defective
would
no

measure
torque
accurately
and

wouldnt

and
near
accidents
that
ive
seen
riders
will
almost
always
stand
on
the
brakes
as
hard
as
they
dare
simply
because
the
instinct
to
brake
in
the

is
so
strong
that
it
overrides
everything

tend

i
think
the
only
way
youll
ever
use
countersteering
reliably
and
correctly
in
a
crisis
is
to
make
it
the
only
conscious
method
of
directional
control
you
ever
use
and
to
practice
it
constantly
even
when
you
have
no
need
to
do
any
turning
if
you
follow
me
down
a
long
straight
and
i
seem
to
be
wiggling
back
and
forth
randomly
or
suddenly
without
obvious
need
its
because
im
practicing
countersteering
and
avoiding
imaginary
obstacles
directly
in
my
path
all
of
this
practice
may
indeed
be
futile
but
if
i
have
even
milliseconds
to
react
the

the
most

will

had

luckily
the

understand

you

stop

far

can
you

avoid
such

suggestions
the
experience
you

why
i
dont

my

i
figure
theres
a
chance
that
ill
be
startled
in
some
way
and
stall
my
bike
and
i
figure
this
is
more
likely
than
the
chance
that
ill
be
unable
to
escape
some
situation
because
of
the
extra
time
needed
to
put
the
bike
in

so
i
concentrate
on
avoiding
situations
rather
than
making
splitsecond
evasive
manuvers
i
split
lanes
so
im
not
at
the
end
of
the
line
unfortunately
this
is
not
legal
in
most
of
the
country
if
i
cant
split
perhaps
there
isnt
room
then
i
will
stop
near
one
side
of
the
lane
so
i
have
an
easy
escape
and
leave
my
bike
in
gear
until
the
next
car
has
stopped
i
watch
in
my
mirrors
in
the
mean
time
to
make
sure
it
will
whether
i
really
would
have
time
to
move
should
a
car
fail
to
stop
i
havent
had
to
find
out
yet
some
cars
have
an
annoying
habbit
of
racing
up
behind
you
before
braking
heavilly
so
it
can
be
hard
to
tell
if
they
are

to

or
not
so
in

i

to
put
it
bluntly
it
sucks
i
really
would
like
some
advice
on
what
would
be
a
good
starter
bike
for
me
i
do
know
one
thing
however
i
need
to
make
my
first

a
good
one
because
buying
a

any

is
out

interested

racing
bikes

i
know
that
this
may
sound
kind

crazy

that
ive
never

a

before
but
i
am
responsible
a

and
in
love
responsible
and
in
love
i
believe
thats
a
contradiction
in
terms
unless
youre
really
brave
read
reckless
a
sport
bike
will
go
way
faster
than
you
dare
for
at
least
your
first
year
of
riding
getting
more
than
that
really
is
overkill
as
youll
never
even
want
to
use
it
the
following
bikes
can
be
bought
and
repaired
cheaply
are
easy
for
a
novice
to
manage
and
are
plenty
high
performance
kawasaki
honda
interceptor
suzuki
the
time
of
the

full

is
way
sooner
than
youre
ready
for
it
with
something
as
small
as
a
youd
probably
be
wishing
for
more
power
pretty
quickly
unless
its
a

rgv
now
im
not
saying
that
youre
certain
to
kill
yourself
immediately
with
a
or
a
plenty
of
people
have
started
riding
on
those
bikes
and
done
just
fine
what
i
am
saying
is
that
its
a
waste
of
money
and
a
waste
of
perfectly
good
plastic
when
you
drop
the
thing
learning
how
to
balance
while
stopping
youll
never
get
the
throttle
more
than
half
open
anyway
so
why
spend
the
extra

squids

yesterday
a
friend
had
asked
me
to
accompany
him
to
a
local
motorcycle
dealer
it
has
been
a
while
since
he
last
rode
years
and
i
myself
have
never
bought
a
new
bike
from
a
dealer
what
follows
is
an
experience
of
that
visit
and
of
an
observation
of
squildly
behavior
by
other
customers
andor
sales
personel
background
i
ride
with
a
group
of
friends
who
mainly
are
into
cruiser
type
bikes
my
friend
was
hell
bent
on
getting
an
intruder
and
had
seen
a
few
used
ones
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
new
ones
were
going
for
so
we
happened
upon
a
dealer
that
sold
both
suzuki
and
yamaha
the
place
was
fairly
busy
so
we
browsed
a
bit
we
happened
upon
a
few
intruders
most
of
which
had
sold
signs
on
my
friend
had
been
bitten
well
the
salesdroid
appeared
and
as
my
friend
started
chewing
the
fat
i
moseid
on
outside
the
next
thing
i
know
i
see
or
sport
bikes
pull
in
i
could
stereotype
the
type
of
riders
backward
ball
hat
oakley
iq
but
i
wont
well
they
went
inside
i
didnt
think
much
of
it
i
figured
to
each
his
own
i
went
back
in
to
see
if
the
salesdroid
had
his
fangs
firmly
implanted
into
my
friends
back
when
i
noticed
the
hormone
gang
talking
to
other
salesdroidsmanagers
lots
of
laughter
jokes
etc
no
big
deal
here
is
the
part
that
concerned
me
the
hg
and
those
shop
personel
that
were
not
busy
with
customers
went
back
out
where
said
hg
members
fired
up
their
rides
and
did
the
obligatory
reving
up
of
those
beasts
at
this
point
one
decided
to
see
how
much
rubber
a
katana
could
deposit
in
the
drive
squids
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
was
appalled
that
the
salesdroidsmanager
not
only
condoned
this
behavior
but
encourged
it
to
the
point
were
they
were
betting
how
long
he
could
keep
it
up
and
egged
him
on
to
pull
a
wheely
as
he
rode
off
onto
a
busy
street
around
rush
hour
the
girl
that
was
riding
pillion
on
another
bike
seemed
rather
hormonal
about
this
display
and
urged
her
pilot
to
quickly
catch
up
the
others
followed
making
sure
there
kerkers
could
be
heard
as
well
as
felt
i
felt
embarassed
at
this
point
to
be
a
motorcyclist
i
felt
the
eyes
of
those
in
cages
witnessing
this
display
then
glancing
over
to
the
dealers
lot
and
damning
all
those
on
two
wheels
needless
to
say
my
friend
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
and
we
left
i
will
now
turn
off
my
frustration
and
go
ride
peacefully
to
clear
my
anger

i

like
any
advice
anyone
had
i
do
not
have

manual
but
have
read
about
the

in
chiltons
and
in
a
few
other
places
is
there
anything
i
need
to
be
particularaly
carful
of
any
problems
anyone
else
has
encountered
i
would
stongly
recommend
a
factory
service
manual
and
if
you
are
not
an
experienced
machanic
then
get
a
chiltons
or
haynes
sp
also
make
sure
the
bike
has
cooled
at
least
hours
since
being
run
read
the
books
and
if
you
have
more
questions
you
could
mail
me
also
be
very
careful
when
tightening
valve
cover
bolts
they
take
very

breaking

though
i
do
have
my
doubts
about
it
is
that
the
mefront

is
applied
first
followed
by
the

brake
the
idea
being
methat
you
avoid
locking
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
takes
place
if
thats
the
official
line
taught
in
those
rider
education
classes
you
were
refering
to
that
also
dont
teach
countersteering
i
have
to
question
the
quality
of
the
classes
me
too
though
unfortunately
the
official
line
is
the
one
that
you
have
to
adhere
to
if
you
want
to
get
a
full
licence
the
examiners
guidelines
are
laid
down
by
the
government
and
the
basic
rider
education
courses
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
them
it
surprises
me
that
none
of
the
rider
groups
here
either
mag
or
the
bmf
make
much
noise
about
the
fact
that
the
riding
test
requires
you
to
ride
three
feet
from
the
kerb
all
the
time
in
order
to
pass
that
the
front
brake
must
be
applied
before
the
rear
that
you
have
to
keep
looking
over
your
shoulder
all
the
time
instead
of
just
when
it
is
justified
theres
probably
a
few
more
too
which
i
cant
think
of
for
the
moment
if
the
riding
test
could
be
rejigged
a
bit
to
include
more
of
the
realworld
survival
skills
and
less
of
the
woefully
simplistic
crap
that
it
contains
now
then
the
accident
figures
would
imho
reduce
still
further

reminds

by

reeve
a
couple

in
cycle
canada
he
was
so
pissed
off
with
cops
pulling
over
speeders
in
dangerous
spots
and
often
blind
corners
that
one
day
he
decided
to
get
revenge
cruising
on
a
factory
loaner
test
bike
he
noticed
a
cop
had
pulled
over
a
motorist
on
an
on
or
off
ramp
with
almost
no
shoulder
being
a
bright
lad
he
hit
his
bikes
kill
switch
just
before
passing
the
cop
who
happened
to
be
bending
towards
the
offending
motorist
thereby
exposing
his
glutes
to
the
passing
world
with
his
ignition
system
now
dead
he
pumped
his
throtle
two
or
three
times
to
fill
his
exhaust
canisters
with
volatile
raw
fuel
all
it
took
was
a
stab
at
the
kill
switch
to
relight
the
ignition
and
send
a
flame
in
sargeant
swells
direction
i
wonder
if
any

cops
read
cycle

although
i
agree
with
the
spirit
of
the
action
i
do
hope
that
the
rider
ponied
up

surprisingly
the

real
cruiser
i
was
expecting
something
rough
shes

honey
and
i
can
go
pretty
much
anyplace
id
take
my
mountain
bike
as
far
as
shaft
effect
its
more
a
torque
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a
bit
maybe
if
the
clutch
is
in
then
a
large
chunk
of
counterrotating
mass
is
not
rotating
hence
at
a
light
reving
makes
it
twist
shaft
effect
is
the
rear
end
rising
under
power
or
the
real
problem
getting
lower
to
the
road
when
the
throttle
is
snapped
shut
say
when
you
are
cornering
and
the
heads
are
real
close
to
the
road
new
gs
bikes
with
the
paralever
shaft
have
almost
no
shaft
effect
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
buffeting
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequence
okay
here
are
my
questions
any
recommendations
for
a
homemade
fairing
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhaps
my
helmet
for
comfort
at
highway
speeds
mph
yet
dont
want
to
a
screw
up
the
stability
or
b
block
my
vision
too
much
for
trail
riding
anybody
have
luck
with
twopiece
detachible
fairings
id
like
to
make
it
myself
out
of
plexiglas
i
run
two
lights
the
standard
headlamp
plus
a
sidelamp
mounted
on
the
crash
bar
the
illuminations
excellent
that
way
with
a
full
beam
coming
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumination
from
left
to
right
and
it
really
picks
up
the
periphery
deer
lurking
etc
combined
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
alternators
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
puttering
around
in
the
dirt
at
low
rpm
its
a
question
of
how
long
you
spend
at
low
rpm
and
how
much
you
need
the
extra
light
at
low
rpm
and
under
they
dont
charge
all
that
much
if
at
all
the
alternators
put
out
sufficient
wattage
it
just
that
you
need
to
be
at
rpm
to
get
it
this
is
embarassing
im
having
trouble
starting
the
bike
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
invariably
flood
the
carbs
then
go
in
and
read
a
section
of
the
paper
and
then
she
starts
right
up
is
this
a
zen
thing
full
choke
open
the
gas
taps
hit
the
starter
and
ever
so
slightly
blip
the
throttle
it
should
fire
cranking
should
be
done
with
minimal
throttle
my
likes
the
throttles
to
be
raised
just
a
bit
off
idle
its
an
experience
thing
like
zen
its
hard
to
describe
it
can
be
hard
to
learn
if
you
arent
paying
atttention
to
the
differences
between
success
and
failure
especially
if
you
get
really
pissed
off
and
flatten
the
battery
while
trying
to
get
it
to
run
if
my
bike
has
been
sitting
for
a
few
weeks
i
give
it
a
short
while
to
start
if
it
doesnt
i
turn
it
off
and
wait
a
few
minutes
for
things
to
vaporize
in
the
fuel
system
and
then
it
lights
right
off
ive
got
dual
plugs
which
make
it
easier
to
start
the
haynes
manual
says
do
not
under
any
circumstances
use
gasoline
with
alcohol
additives
yeah
right
what
do
you
folks
due
to
keep
the
engine
and
carbs
from
being
eaten
by
ethanol
and
methanol
any
particular
brands
of
gas
that
are
best
additives
the
big
fix
is
the
bing
carb
upgrade
kit
its
good
for
a
few
mpg
and
the
parts
are
alcohol
proof
the
parts
it
replaces
arent
alcohol
proof
as
long
as
the
bike
isnt
going
to
sit
for

re
dogs
vs
bikes
my
first
encounter
with
a
dog
chasing
after
my
bike
was
on
my
first
poker
run
a
big
german
shepard
ran
out
into
the
pack
of
bikes
i
was
riding
with
and
tried
to
bite
the
right
leg
of
the
guy
riding
in
front
of
me
he
kicked
the
dog
a
couple
of
times
we
were
all
only
going
about
and
just
made
the
dog
angrier
and
got
away
by
applying
wfo
and
outrunning
the
dog
who
then
started
after
yours
truly
at
the
time
i
had
open
drag
pipes
obnoxiously
loud
as
hell
and
as
soon
as
the
dog
was
about
feet
away
from
the
right
side
of
my
bike
i
pulled
in
the
clutch
and
revved
the
motor
up
to
about
and
the
roar
of
the
pipes
frightened
the
dog
away
probably
made
the
dogs
ears
hurt
like
hell
and
he
didnt
come
back
for
the
rest
of
the
bikers
behind
me
either
my
second
encounter
was
with
an
already
deceased
roadkill
dog
i
wasnt
paying
very
close
attention
to
the
pavement
when
the
car
in
front
of
me
straddled
the
carcass
i
looked
down
just
in
time
to
see
what
i
was
about
to
run
over
so
i
just
held
onto
the
handlebars
and
freaked
out
both
wheels
went
squarely
over
the
dogs
belly
with
a
thumpthump
just
like
running
over
a
piece
of
a
lumber
the
bike
didnt
lose
any
stability
at
all
and
i
kept
on
going
after
i
got
to
my
destination
i
found
bits
of
fur
meat
and
blood
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
my
motor

putting

is

in

it
is

i
dont

they
are

half
as
expensive
thanks
dave
cost
is
lower
than

they
weigh

also
in

you
do

i
replaced
my
oem
canister
with
an
ontario

slip
on
the
midrange
performance
is
better
but
i
also
notice
a
slight
stumble
at
rpm
after
talking
to
kaz
yoshima
the
developer
and
manufacturer
of
the
slip
on
he
thinks
i
might

larger

was
not
suppose
to

maybe
where
i
live
makes
a
difference
altitude
barometric

anyway
besides
that
minor
glitch
i
like
the
slip
on
performance
and
the
sound
which
is
louder
than
stock
but
not
loud
enough
to
annoy
folks
the
ontario
slip
on
use
some
sort
of
sound
baffling
technique
to
reduce
the
sound
at
full
throttle
just
remember
every
bike
is
a
tuned
system
when
you
change
the
intake
or
exhaust
characteristics
beyond
the
allowable
delta
of
the
manufacturer
you
may
have
to
change
other
areas
to
compensate
like
a
complete
change
of
the
exhaust
system
header
and
muffler
changes
the
exhaust
characteristic
to
the
point
which
rejetting
is

breathingpumping
profile
talk
with
the

who
make

calibur
of
people
you
would
find
at
a
laundromat
when
some
young
woman
walked
in
who
required
our
conferring
attentions
he
came
over
and
stood
in
line
with
me
while
we
watched
her
fill
out
some
forms
and
then
we
noticed
a
little
kid
about
years
old
reach
over
the
bench
and
touch
our
helmets
one
at
a
time
i
didnt
particularly
mind
and
neither
did
ken
that
the
kid
was
touching
our
helmets
that
is
but
the
helmets
werent
on
the
most
stable
of
platforms
so
ken
scooted
over
there
to
resettle
them
and
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
helmets
mother
of
said
child
started
shrieking
at
her
kid
you
stay
away
from
those
you
shit
and
whopped
the
tyke
brutally
about
the
head
and
shoulders
i
suppose
it
was
our
scary
sex
drugs
and
unix
tshirts
that
sent
such
bouts
of
terror
through
her
body

sometimes

the
scary
bit
about
this
is
the
is
the
nonavailability
of
rear
lights
at
all
now
living
in
the
netherlands
ive
learned
that
the
only
reliable
indicators
are
those
red
ones
which
go
on
at
both
sides
at
once
some
people
call
them
brake
lights
once
they
light
up
expect
anything
to
occur
in
front
of
you
its
not
just
the
dutch
though
however
i
never
realised
how
much
i
relied
on
this
until
i
got
caught
a
few
times
behind
someone
whose
lights
didnt
work
at
all
once
id
sussed
it
out
it
wasnt
so
bad
knowing
it
is
half
the
battle
but
its
a
great
way
to
find
out
that
youve
been
following
someone
too
closely
now
i
try
to
check
for
lights
all
the
time
cos
that
split
second
can
make
all
the
difference
though
it
shouldnt
be
necessary
i
know
owen
what
used
to
peeve
me
in
canada
was
the
cars
with
bloody
red
rear
indicators
youd
see
a
single
red
light
come
on
and
think
now
is
he
stopping
but
one
brakelamp
is
not
working
or
does
he
have
those
dumb
bloody
red
rear
indicators
this
being
survival
you
have
to
assume
hes
braking
and
take
the
appropriate
actions
until
such
time
as
the
light
goes
out
and
on
again
after
which
you
can
be
reasonably
certain
its
a
bloody
red
rear
indicator

is

then
the
second
most
frequently
asked
question
must
be
how
do
i
get
a
dod
number
that
is
as
simple
as
asking
the
keeper
of
the
list
kotl
accept
no
substitue
keepers
for
a
number
if
youre
feeling
creative
and
your
favorite
number
hasnt
been
taken
already
you
can
make
a
request
subject
to
kotl
approval
warning
nonnumeric
non
number
requests
are
likely
to
earn
a
flame
from
the
kotl
not
that
you
wont
get
it
but
you
will
pay
for
it
oh
and
just
one
little
tiny
suggestion
ask
the
kotl
in
email
youll
just
be
playing
the
lightning
rod
for
flames
if
you
post
to
the
whole
net
and
youll
look
like
a
clueless
newbie
too
by
now
youre
probably
asking
so
whos
the
kotl
already
well
as
john
sloan
notes
below
thats
about
the
only
real
secret
left
around
here
but
a
few
unsubtle
hints
can
be
divulged
first
it
is
not
myself
nor
anyone
mentioned
by
name
in
this
posting
maybe
though
john
was
the
original
kotl
second
in
keeping
with
the
true
spirit
of
unix
the
kotls
first
name
is
only
two
letters
long
and
can
be
spelled
entirely
with
hexadecimal
characters
the
kotl
shares
his
name
with
a
line
oriented
text
utility
third
he
has
occasionally
been
seen
posting
messages
bestowing
new
dod
numbers
mostly
to
boneheads
with
weenie
mailers
fourth
there
is
reason
to
suspect
the
kotl
of
being
a
deadhead
newsflash
a
message
from
the
kotl
once
you
have
surmounted
this
intellectual
pinnacle
and
electronically
groveled
to
the
kotl
please
keep
in
mind
that
the
kotl
does
indeed
work
for
a
living
and
occasionally
must
pacify
its
boss
by
getting
something
done
your
request
may
languish
in
mailer
queue
for
gasp
days
perhaps
even
horrors
a
week
or
two
during
such
times
of
economic
activity
on
the
part
of
the
kotls
employers
sending
yet
another
copy
of
your
request
will
not
speed
processing
of
the
queue
it
just
makes
it
longer
verification
of
this
phenominon
is
left
as
an
excersize
for
the
reader
if
you
suspect
mailer
problems
at
least
annotate
subsequent
requests
with
an
indication
that
a
former
request
was
submitted
lest
you
be
assigned
multiple
numbers
what
you
think
the
kotl
memorizes
the
list
one
more
thing
the
kotl
says
that
its
telepathic
powers
arent
what
they
used
to
be
so
provide
some
information
for
the

while

the
difference
between

is
that
although
they
get

just
about

most

by
an
estimated
people
most
of
the
frequent
posters
belong
to
a
motorcycle
club
the
denizens
of
doom
usually
referred
to
as
the
dod
the
dod
started
when
motorcyclist
john
r
nickerson
wrote
a
couple
of
parodies
designed
to
poke
fun
at
motorcycle
stereotypes
fellow
computer
enthusiast
bruce
robinson
posted
these
articles
under
the
pen
name
denizen
of
doom
a
while
later
chuck
rogers
signed
off
as
dod
nr
keeper
of
the
flame
bruce
was
then
designated
dod
nr
retroactively
and
of
course
nickerson
the
originator
of
the
parodies
was
given
dod
nr
the
idea
of
a
motorcycle
club
with
no
organization
no
meetings
and
no
rules
appealed
to
many
so
john
sloan
dod
nr
became
keeper
of
the
list
issuing
dod
numbers
to
anyone
who
wanted
one
to
date
there
have
been
almost
memberships
issued
to
people
all
over
the
united
states
and
canada
as
well
as
australia
new
zealand
the
united
kingdom
france
germany
norway
and
finland
keeper
of
the
list
sloan
eventually
designed
a
club
patch
the
initial
run
of
patches
sold
out
immediately
the
profits
from
this
went
to
the
american
motorcycle
heritage
foundation
another
amhf
fund
raiser
selling
denizens
of
doom
pins
to
members
was
started
by
arnie
skurow
a
few
months
later
again
the
project
was
successful
and
the
profits
were
donated
to
the
foundation
so
far
the
denizens
have
contributed
over
to
the
ama
museum
a
plaque
in
the
name
of
the
denizens
of
doom
now
hangs
in
the
motorcycle
heritage
museum
as
often
as
possible
the
doders
crawl
out
from
behind
their
crts
and
go
riding
together
it
turns
out
that
the
two
largest
concentrations
of
doders
are
centered
near
denverboulder
colorado
and
in
californias
silicon
valley
consequently
two
major
events
are
the
annual
assault
on
rollins
pass
in
colorado
and
the
northern
versus
southern
california
joust
the
rideandfeed
is
a
bike
trip
over
rollins
pass
followed
by
a
big
barbecue
dinner
the
concept
for
the
joust
is
to
have
riders
from
northern
california
ride
south
riders
from
southern
california
to
ride
north
meeting
at
a
predesignated
site
somewhere
in
the
middle
an
additional
plan
for
is
to
hold
an
official
denizens
of
doom
homecoming
in
conjunction
with
the
ama
heritage
homecoming
in
columbus
ohio
in
july
though
its
a
safe
bet
the
the
denizens
of
doom
and
their
collective
communications
hub
recmotorcycles
will
not
replace
the
more
traditional
motorcycle
organizations
for
those
who
prowl
the
electronic
pathways
in
search
of
twowheeled
camaraderie
its
a
great
way
for
kindred
spirits
to
get
together
long
may
they
flame
live
to
flame
flame
to
live
centerbar
this
official
motto
of
the
denizens
of
doom
refers
to
the
ease
with
which
you
can
gratuitously
insult
someone
electronically
when
you
would
not
do
anything
like
that
face
to
face
these
insults
are
known
as
flames
issuing
them
is
called
flaming
flames
often
start
when
a
member
disagrees
with
something
another
member
has
posted
over
the
network
a
typical
sophisticated
intelligent
form
of
calm
reasoned
rebuttal
would
be
something
like
what
an
incredibly
stupid
statement
you
spandexclad
poseur
this
will
guarantee
that
five
other
people
will
reply
in
defense
of
the
original
poster
describing
just
what
they
think
of
you
your
riding
ability
and
your
cat
the
denizens
of
doom
the
saga
unfolds
by
john
sloan
dod
periodically
the
question
what
is
dod
is
raised
this
is
one
of
those
questions
in
the
same
class
as
why
is
the
sky
blue
if
there
is
a
god
why
is
there
so
much
suffering
in
the
world
and
why
do
women
inevitably
tell
you
that
youre
such
a
nice
guy
just
before
they
dump
you
the
kinds
of
questions
steeped
in
mysticism
tradition
and
philosophy
questions
that
have
inspired
research
and
discussion
by
philosophers
in
locker
rooms
motorcycle
service
bays
and
in
the
halls
of
academe
for
generations
a
long
long
time
ago
in
computer
time
where
anything
over
a
few
minutes
is
an
eternity
and
the
halting
problem
really
is
a
problem
on
a
computer
far
far
away
on
the
net
topologically
speaking
two
machines
in
the
same
room
in
atlanta
might
route
mail
to
one
another
via
a
system
in
chicago
a
chap
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
but
who
was
eventually
assigned
the
dod
membership
wrote
a
satire
of
the
various
personalities
and
flame
wars
of
recmotorcycles
and
signed
it
the
denizen
of
doom
not
wishing
to
identify
himself
he
asked
that
stalwart
individual
who
would
in
the
fullness
of
time
become
dod
to
post
it
for
him
dod
not
really
giving
a
whit
about
what
other
people
thought
and
generally
being
a
right
thinking
individual
did
so
flaming
and
other
amusements
followed
he
who
would
become
the
holder
of
dod
membership
thought
this
was
the
funniest
thing
hed
seen
in
a
while
being
the
sort
that
is
pretty
easily
amused
so
he
claimed
membership
in
the
denizens
of
doom
motorcycle
club
and
started
signing
his
postings
with
his
membership
number
perhaps
readers
of
recmotorcycles
were
struck
with
the
vision
of
a
motorcycle
club
with
no
dues
no
rules
no
restrictions
as
to
brand
or
make
or
model
or
national
origin
of
motorcycle
a
club
organized
electronically
it
may
well
be
that
readers
were
yearning
to
become
a
part
of
something
that
would
provide
them
with
a
greater
identity
a
gestalt
personality
something
in
which
the
whole
was
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
it
could
also
be
that
were
all
computer
nerds
who
wear
black
socks
and
sneakers
and
pocket
protectors
who
just
happen
to
also
love
taking
risks
on
machines
with
awesome
power
to
weight
ratios
social
outcasts
who
saw
a
clique
that
would
finally
be
open
minded
enough
to
accept
us
as
members
in
a
clear
case
of
self
fulfilling
prophesy
the
denizens
of
doom
motorcycle
club
was
born
a
club
in
which
the
majority
of
members
have
never
met
one
another
face
to
face
and
perhaps
like
it
that
way
yet
feel
that
they
know
one
another
pretty
well
or
well
enough
given
some
of
the
electronic
personalities
in
the
newsgroup
a
club
organized
and
run
in
the
loosest
sense
of
the
word
by
volunteers
through
the
network
via
electronic
news
and
mail
with
a
membershipmailing
list
often
used
to
organize
group
rides
amongst
members
who
live
in
the
same
region
a
motto
a
logo
a
series
of
photo
albums
circulating
around
the
country
organized
by
dod
club
patches
organized
by
and
even
an
mtvstyle
music
video
produced
by
and
distributed
on

by
where
will
it
end
who
knows
will
the
dod
start
sanctioning

placing

on
the

will
the
dod
organize
poker
runs
where
each
participant
collects
a

of

cards
will
the
dod
have
a
rally
in
which
the
attendees
demand
a
terminal

and
at

a

only
time
will
tell
the

has
no

no
rules
and
no
requirements
other
than
net
access
and
a
love
for
motorcycles
to
become
a

one
need
only
ask
although
we
will
admit
that
who
you
must
ask
is
one
of
the

why
you
have

well
the
first
thing
you
have
to
understand
just
in
case
you
managed
to
read
this
far
and
still
not
figure
it
out
is
that
the
dod
started
as
a
joke
and
in
the
words
of
one
denizen
it
intends
to
remain
one
sometime
in
the
far
distant
past
a
hapless
newbie
asked
what
does
dod
stand
for
its
not
the
department
of
defense
is
it
naturally
a
denizen
who
had
watched
the
movie
top
gun
a
few
times
too
many
rose
to
the
occasion
and
replied
thats
classified
we
could
tell
you
but
then
wed
have
to
kill
you
and
the
rest
is
history
a
variation
on
the
security
theme
is
to
supply
disinformation
about
what
dod
stands
for
notable
contributions
and
contributers
where
known
include
daughters
of
democracy
dod
doers
of
donuts
dancers
of
despair
dod
debasers
of
daughters
dickweeds
of
denver
driveway
of
death
debauchers
of

dumpers
of
dirtbikes

that
this
is
not
a

recmotorcycles
photo
album
many
copies
were
made
and
several
sets
were
sent
on
tours
around
the
world
only
to
vanish
in
unknown
locations
then
bruce
tanner
decided
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
an
electronic
medium
to
have
an
electronic
photo
album
bruce
has
not
only
provided
the
disk
space
and
ftp
email
access
but
he
has
taken
the
time
to
scan
most
of
the
photos
that
are
available
from
the
archive
not
only
can
you
see
what
all
these
folks
look
like
you
can
also
gawk
at
their
motorcycles
a
few
nonphoto
files
are
available
from
the
server
too
they
include
the
dod
membership
list
the
dod
yellow
pages
the
general
recmotorcycles
faq
and
this
faq
posting
here
are
a
couple
of
excerpts
from
from
messages
bruce
posted
about
how
to
use
the
archive
via
ftp
cerritosedu
via
email
the
address
is
servercerritosedu
the
commands
are
given
in
the
body
of
the
message
the
current
commands
are
dir
and
send
given
one
per
line
the
arguments
to
the
commands
are
vms
style
file
specifications
for

the
file
spec
is
dodfile
for
example
you
can
send

send
dodbrucetannergif
send

and
youll
get
back

a
directory
listing
uuencoded
parts
of

and
the

in

oh

but
a
maximum

a

of
comments
bruce
has
put
quite
a
bit
of
effort
into
this
so
why
not
drop
him
a
note
if
you
find
the
recmotophoto
archive
useful
second
since
bruce
has
provided
the

as
a
favor
it
would
be
kind
of
you
to
access
it
after

time
patches
what
patches
you
may
have
heard
mention
of
various
dod
trinkets
such
as
patches
pins
and
your
reaction
was
probably
i
want
or
thats
sick
or
perhaps
thats
sick
i
want
well
theres
some
good
news
and
some
bad
news
the
good
news
is
that
theres
been
an
amazing
variety
of
dodlabeled
widgets
created
the
bad
news
is
that
there
isnt
anywhere
you
can
buy
any
of
them
this
isnt
because
of
any
exclusivity
attempt
but
simply
because
there
is
no
dod
store
that
keeps
a
stock
all
of
the
creations
have
been
done
by
individual
denizens
out
of
their
own
pockets
the
typical
procedure
is
someone
says
im
thinking
of
having
a
dod
frammitz
made
theyll
cost
xxxx
with
xxxx
going
to
the
ama
museum
anyone
want
one
then
orders
are
taken
and
a
batch
of
frammitzes
large
enough
to
cover
the
prepaid
orders
is
produced
and
quickly
consumed
so
if
you
want
a
dod
doodad
act
quickly
the
next
time
somebody
decides
to
do
one
or
produce
one
yourself
if
you
see
a
void
that
needs
filling
after
all
this
is
anarchy

no

got

put

i
pushed

it

from

cracked

cracked

its
going

cost
me
to
get
the
local
body
shop
to
fix
it
and
that
is
after
i
take
the
fairing
off
for
them
still
thats
probably
cheaper
than
the

alone

i
bought
a

from

got

my
sisters
exboyfriend
was
such
an
incessant
pain
in
the
ass
about
wanting
to
ride
my
bikes
no
way
jose
that
i
finally
took
him
to
lindners
bmw
in
new
canaan
ct
last
fall
where
i
had
seen
a
nice
used
in
perfect
condition
after
telling
everyone
in
the
shop
his
norton
war
stories
from
fifteen
years
ago
signing
the
liability
waiver
and
getting
his
preflight
off
he
went
well
not
quite
i
walked
out
of
a
pizza
shop
up
the
street
feeling
good
about
myself
made
my
sisters
boyfriend
happy
and
got
the
persistent
wanker
off
my
ass
for
good
heard
the
horrendous
racket
of
an
engine
tortured
to
its
red
line
and
then
a
crash
i
saw
people
running
towards
the
obvious
source
of
the
disturbance
jeff
laying
under
the
bmw
with
the
rear
wheel
spinning
wildly
and
someone
groping
for
the
kill
switch
i
stared
in
disbelief
with
a
slice
hanging
out
of
my
mouth
as
matty
the
shop
manager
slid
up
beside
me
and
asked
friend
of
yours
steve
shit
matty
it
could
have
been
worse
that
could
been
my
flhs
jeff
hadnt
made
it
inches
witnesses
said
he
lifted
his
feet
before
letting
out
the
clutch
and
gravity
got
the
best
of
him
jeff
claimed
that
the
clutch
didnt
engage
matty
was
quick
while
jeff
was
still
stuttering
in
embarrassed
shock
he
managed
to
snatch
jeffs
credit
card
for
a
quick
imprint
and
signature
twenty
minutes
later
when
jeffs
color
had
paled
to
a
flush
matty
presented
him
with
an
estimate
of
for
a
busted
right
mirror
and
a
hairline
crack
in
the
fairing
that
was
for
fixing
the
crack
and
masking
the
damaged
area
not
a
new
fairing
or
he
could
buy
the
bike
im
not
sure
what
happened
later
as
my
sister
split
up
with
jeff
shortly
afterwards
to
hook
up
with
another
piece
of
work
except
that
matty
told
me
he
ran
the

while

does
a

hey

why

probably
a

a

is

to

an

day
in

a

while
i
was
waiting
my
turn
to
state
my
case

plea
of
why
i
was
going

i
had
the
opportunity
to
listen
to
some
of
the
creative
excuses
offered
the

by
others
after
listening
to
a
number
of
well
i
was
passing
a
very
slow
truck
that
suddenly
speed
up
versions
i
decided
that
the

had
heard
just
about
every
story
in
the
book
and
then
some
he
was
less

impressed
with
any

this

rather

had

ohio

he
was

riding
a

at

in

zone
it
was
also
noted
that
the
defendant
motorcycle
rider
had
alcohol
on
his
breath
but
was
not
cited
for
this
offence
the
judge
looked
over
his
half
glasses
purched
on
the
end
of
his
nose
and
said
in
his
sternest
voice
well
son
those
are
some
pretty
fast
speeds
to
be
riding
a

what
do
you
have

meekly
the

replied
i
just
was
over
to
my

and
we
had
a
couple
of
beers
and
i
was
on
my
way
home
he
offered
nothing
more
or
less
just
had
a
couple
of
beers
and
was
doing
mph
on
his
way
home
the
judge
moved
by
the
simplicity
of
the
response
fined
him
the
maximum
in
this

plus
court
costs

to
reduce

function
provided
when
the
riders
body
slides
off

stated

looked

kinda
fast
coming
down

you
must
have
been
going

i
just

its
your

to
make
it

much

maybe
theyll
give
up
and
leave

alone
someday
soon
the

was
certainly
within
his
legal
rights
to
nail
you
by
guessing
your
speed
mr
brown
the
author
of
fight
your

mentions
an
oakland
judge
who
convicted
a
speeder
on
the
officers
testimony
that
the
drivers
car
sounded
like
it
was
being
driven
at
an
excessive
speed
you
can
pay
off
the
state
and
your
insurance
company
or
you
can
take
it
to
court
and
be
creative
personally
ive
never
won
that
way
or
seen
anyone
win
but
the
judge
always
listens
politely
and
i
havent
seen
that
many
attempts
you
could
try
the
argument
that
since
bikes
are
shorter
than
the
cars
whose
speed
the
nice
officer
is
accustomed
to
guessing
they
therefore
appear
to
be
further
away
and
so
their
speed
appears
to
be
greater
than
it
actually
is
i
left
out
a
step
or
two
but
you
get
the
idea
if
you
can
make
it
convincing
theoretically
youre
supposed
to
win
ive
never
tried
proving
the
cop
was
mistaken
i
did
get
to
see
some
other
poor
biker
try
it
he
was
mixing
up
various
facts
like
the
maximum
acceleration
of
a
cop
car
and
the
distance
at
which
the
cop
had
been
pacing
him
and
end
up
demonstrating
that
he
couldnt
possibly
have
been
going
as
fast
as
the
cop
had
suggested
hed
brought
diagrams
and
a
calculator
he
was
prepared
he
lost
keep
in
mind
cops
do
this
all
the
time
and
their
word
is
better
than
yours
maybe
though
they
dont
guess
how
fast
bikes
are
going
all
the
time
besides
this
guy
didnt
speak
english
very
well

ended

absolutely

gave

a

for
sounding

i

id
probably
show
up
in

without
a

simply
because
sounding
like
speeding
is
ridiculous
if
i
was
found
guilty
id
appeal
and
then
show
up

as
summer
approaches
the
usual
preparations
are
being
made
me
was
thinking
of
going
for
some
overnite
camping
trips
in
the
local
state
forests
for
that
i
was
planning
to
get
a
backpackrucksack
the
next
question
is
how
shall
i
carry
the
thing
on
the
bike
given
the
metal
frame
and
all
i
have
a
big
backrest
approx
high
and
was
hoping
that
i
would
be
able
to
bungee
cord
the
backpack
to
the
backrest
any
one
have
any
experiences
on
such
experimentation
taking
the
idea
further
what
would
happen
if
the
backpack
was
fully
loaded
with
a
full
load
is
the
load
distribution
going
to
be
very
severly
affected
how
will
the
bike
perform
with
such
a
load
clinging
to
the
back
rest
if
i
really
secure
it
with
no
shifting
do
i
still
increase
my
chances
of
surfing
i
ride
my
bike
regularly
to
classes
with
my
book
bag
i
take
the
shoulder
straps
on
the
bag
and
hook
them
around
the
rear
turn
signals
i
works
fine
you
probably
will
want
to
attach
it
with
a
bungee
cord
to
keep
it
from
shifting
to
one
side

another

in
close

to
highly
prized

recommended
that
manufacturers
build
the
tank
so
as
to
reduce
the

step
function
provided
when
the
riders
body
slides
off
of
the
seat

onto
the

in
the
unfortunate
event
that
the
bike
stops
suddenly
and
the
rider
doesnt
i
think
its
really
inspiring
how
the
manufacturers
have
taken
this
advice
to
heart
in
their
design
of
bikes
like
the
and
the
when
im
riding
my
my
goodies
are
already
up

the
design
of

tends

move
you

wouldnt
the

danger
to
ones

be
due

accelerating

recommend
a

power
delivery

too
uneven
for

dod
newbie

would
be
more
appropriate
because
the

jeeps
youre
supposed
to
keep
the

up
then
why
does
it
go
down
because
it
wouldnt
be
a
jeep
if
it
didnt
a
friend
of
mine
just
bought
one
and
it
has
more
warning
stickers
than
those
little
i
guess
thats
becuase
its
a
big
wheeler
anyway
its
written
in
about
ten
places
that
the
windshield
should
remain
up
at
all
times
and
it
looks
like
theyve
made
it
a
pain
to
put
it
down
anyway
from
what
he
says
to
be
fair
i
do
admit
that
it
would
be
a
similar
matter
to
drive
a
windscreenless
jeep
on
the
highway
as
for
bikers
they
may
participate
in
this
discussion
but
theyre
probably
few
and
far
between
so
i
maintain
that
this
topic
is
of
interest
primarily
to
bikers
snow
skis
no
bugs
and
most
poeple
who
go
fast
wear
goggles
so
do
most
helmetless
motorcyclists
notice
how
ed
picked
on
the
more
insignificant
the
lower
case
part
of
the
two
parts
of
the
statement
besides
around
here
it
is
quite
rare
to
see
bikers
wear
goggles
on
the
street
its
either
full
face
with
shield
or
open
face
with
either
nothing
or
aviator
sunglasses
my
experience
of
bicycling
with
contact
lenses
and
sunglasses
says
that
nonwraparound
sunglasses
do
almost
nothing
to
keep
the
crap
out
of
ones
eyes
the
question
still
stands
how
do
cruiser
riders
with
no
or
negligible
helmets
stand
being
on
the
highway
at
mph
on
buggy
summer
evenings
helmetless
goggleless
ok
ok
fine
whatever
you
say
but
lets
make
some
attmept
to
stick
to
the
point
ive
been
out
on
the
road
where
i
had
to
stop
every
half
hour
to
clean
my
shield
there
were
so
many
bugs
and
my
jacket
would
be
a
bloodsplattered
mess
and
id
see
guys
with
shorty
helmets
no
goggles
long
beards
and
tight
tshirts
merrily
cruising
along
on
bikes
with
no
windscreens
lets
be
really
specific
this
time
so
that
even
ed
understands
does
anbody
think
that
splattering
bugs
with
ones
face
is
fun
or
are
there
other
reasons
to
do

riding
jacket
recommendations
my
old
jacket
is
about
to
bite
the
dust
so
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
riding
jacket
im
looking
for
recommendations
for
a
suitable
replacement
i
would
like
to
buy
a
full
aerostich
suit
but
i
cant
afford
for
it
right
now
im
considering
two
basic
options
buy
the
aerostich
jacket
only
dunno
how
much
it
costs
due
to
recent
price
increases
but
id
imagine
over
that
may
be
pushing
my
limit
advantages
include
the
fact
that
i
can
later
add
the
pants
and
that
it
nearly
eliminates
the
need
for
the
jacket
portion
of
a
rainsuit
buy
some
kind
of
leather
jacket
i
like
a
few
of
the
new
heingericke
firstgear
line
however
they
may
be
a
bit
pricey
unless
i
can
work
some
sort
of
deal
advantages
of
leather
are
potentially
slightly
better
protection
enhanced
pose
value
we
all
know
how
important
that
is
possibly
cheaper
than
upper
aerostich
requirements
for
a
jacket
are
that
it
must
fit
over
a
few
other
layers
mainly
a
sizing
thing
if
leather
id
prefer
a
zipout
lining
it
must
have
some
body
armor
similar
to
aerostich
elbows
shoulders
forearms
possibly
backkidney
protection
etc
a
reasonable
amount
of
pocket
space
would
be
nice
ventilation
would
be
a
plus
however
it
must
be
wearable
in
cold
weather
below
freezing
with
layers
or
perhaps
electrics
please
fire
away
with
suggestions
comments
etc

hi
i
just
have
a
small
question
about
my
bike
being
a
fairly
experienced
bmw
and
mzmechanic
i
just
dont
know
what
to
think
about
my
honda
she
was
using
too
much
oil
for
the
last
km
on
my
trip
to
daytona
bike
week
this
spring
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
trailed
smoke
like
hell
and
was
running
only
on
one
cylinder
i
towed
the
bike
home
and
took
it
apart
but
everything
looks
in
perfect
working
order
no
cracks
in
the
heads
or
pistons
the
cylinder
walls
look
very
clean
and
the
wear
of
pistons
and
cylinders
is
not
measurable
all
still
within
factory
specs
the
only
thing
i
could
find
however
was
a
slightly
bigger
ring
gap
on
the
right
cylinder
the
one
with
the
problem
but
it
is
still
way
below
the
wearlimit
given
in
the
clymermanual
for
this
bike
any
syggestions
what
else
could
cause
my
problem
do
i
have
to
hone
the
cylinder
walls
make
them
a
little
rougher
in
a
crisscrosspattern
in
order
to
get
better
breaking
in
of
my
new
rings
wont
that
increase
the
wear
of
my
pistons

you
can
easily

up

through

many
of

you

won

others
lost

lying

your

one

lost
because
the

just

be

the
mood
for
such
foolishness
several
of
you
suggested
that
i
obtain
a
book
called
fight
your
ticket
the
general
theme
from
those
who
said
go
for
it
was
to
be
prepared
i
should
do
as
much
research
as
possible
go
back
and
review
the
scene
transcribe
what
happened
to
tape
or
paper
use
any
witnesses
that
may
have
been
around
have
a

one

if

says

then

between

never

in

make

if

fully
at

make
sure
that
if
you
attempt
it
you
can
make
the
driver
aware
of
you
by
at

getting
into
his

this
also
applies
to
merging
into
another
lane
after
making
a
pass
do
it
as
positively
as

and
what
i
try
to
do
is
look
in
the

and
then
over
my

after

accelerate

off

my

while
trying
to
rock
it
onto
its

chipped
the
heck
out
of
the

so
i
cheerfully
spent
on
a
bottle
of
testors
model
paint
and
repainted
the
scratches
and
chips
for
minutes
then
while
it
was
drying
i
realized
that
i
was
out
of
smokes
and
that
my
cage
is
not
currently
running
so
i
had
to
take
my
bike
down
to
the
store
not
wanting
to
mess
up

job
i
said
well
heck
i
can

this
is
your
standard

i
didnt
notice
a

difference
when
i
switched

switching

too

if

say

what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my
size
to
have
a

should

heard
them

one
of
the
things
that
is
really
good
about

from

ive
heard
practically
no

steals

probably
it
is
similar
for

guzzis

exotics

there
isnt

i

on

got
pulled
over

i

for
speeding

something

just
as
the
cop
was
about
to
step
out

the

punches
it
down
an

in

ang
then
the

gives

now
this
was

it

takeoff
and
chase
to
the

happened
at

the

who
is
being
relentless
chased
down
box
the
cage
with

disco
lights
slows
a
couple

times
to
taunt
the

blowing
a
few

signs
and
making

the
side
he
goes
up
a

the
kat
although
not
the

machine
is
still
a
high

machine
and
he
slams
on
the

of
couse
we
all
know
that
cages
especially
the
ones
with
the
disco
lights
cant
stop
as
fast
as
our
high
performance
machines
so
what
happens
the
cage
plows
into
the
kat
luckily
for
this
dude
he
was
wearing
a
helmet
and
was
not
hurt
but
dude
how
crazy
can
you
get
yeah
weve
all
went
out

played

with

with

how

it
took
just
one
look
at
a

tried
this
crap
to
convince

not

like

although
the

collided
with

head
on

the

still
looked

was

once
i
was
going

work
on
a
yamaha
twin
aka
the
vibrating
tank
when
i
heard
a
wierd
noise
off
to
my
left
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
silver
headed
for
my
left
foot
and
jerked
it
up
about
a
nanosecond
before
my
bike
was
hit
hard
in
the
left
side
when
i
went
to
put
my
foot
back
on
the
peg
i
found
that
it
was
not
there
i
pulled
into
the
nearest
parking
lot
and
discovered
that
i
had
been
hit
by
a
wirewheel
type
hubcap
from
a
large
cage
this
hubcap
weighed
about
pounds
the
impact
had
bent
the
left
peg
flat
against
the
frame
and
tweeked
the

in

had
i
not

anyone
else
had
this
sort
of
experience
not
with
a
hub
cap
but
one
of
those
lumber
yard
delivery
trucks
made
life
interesting
when
he
hit
a
dip
in
the
road
and
several
sheets
of
sheetrock
and
a
dozen
gallon
cans
of
spackle
came
off
at
mph
it
got
real
interesting
for
about
seconds
or
so
had
to
use
a
wood
mallet
to
get
all
the
dried
spackle
off

on

wibbled
thanks
to
everyone
who
posted
in
my
previous
quest
for
camping
info
another
question
well
not
strictly
rm
stuff
i
am
looking
for
a
thermosflask
to
keep
coffee
hot
i
mean
real
hot
of
course
it
must
be
the
unbreakable
type
so
far
what
ever
metal
type
i
have
wasted
money
on
has
not
matched
the
vacuumglass
type
any
info
appreciated
sanjay
back
in
my
youth
ahem
the
wiffy
and
moi
purchased
a
gadget
which
heated
up
water
from
a
source
it
was
for
car
use
but
we
thought
wed
try
it
on
my
it
worked
ok
apart
from
one
slight
problem
we
had
to
keep
the
revs
above
any
lower
and
the
motor
would
die
from
lack
of
electron
movement
it
made
for
interesting
cups
of
coffee
anyhow
we
would
plot
routes
that
contained
straights
of
over
three
miles
so
that
we
had
sufficient
time
to
get
the
water
to
boiling
point
this
is
sometimes
difficult
in
england
good
luck
on
your
quest

i
just
got
to
thinking
why
dont
manufacturers
still
make
bikes
with
turbos
etc
because
they
add
a
lot
of
expense
and
complexity
and
make
for
a
less
reliable
and
less
controllable
bike
as
an
extreme

the

on

anything

and
the

wants
to
cut
out
all
the

the
recommended
cure
in

mags
seems
to
be
to
switch
off

for

thaw

icebut
this
is
obviously
not

of
a
cure
mine
has
had
the
kawasaki
heated
carb
mod
but
the
problem
persists
ive
covered
the
rad
which
makes
the

run
warmer

moves
the
problem
down
the

scale
a
degree

have
you
talked

maybe
they
did
another

of

upgrade
kit
got
to
be
worth

did
you
do
the

did
you
buy
it

from

tells
part

choose

interpret

in

wide
variety

ways

the
public
at
large
i
seldom
hear
any
advice
that
doesnt

with
something
ive
experienced
if
you
dont
believe
me
i
suggest
you
get
a
copy
of
the
vehicle
code
study
it
and
then
sit
in
on
a
day
or
two
of
court
and
see
what
really
happens
read
fight
your
ticket
too
but
dont
miss
the
little
section
at
the
end
where
it
says
your
chances
are
lousy

youre
basically
screwed
as
you
may
have
guessed
im
pretty
down
on
the
system
here
in

ive
carefully
prepared

court
bringing
witnesses

revealing

holes

story
only
to
be
slapped

the
maximum
allowable
fine
plus
assessments
of
over
the
message
clear
that
the
judge
does
not
appreciate
john
q
public
trying
his
own
cases
so
heres
my
advice
when
you
find
yourself
with
a
ticket
take
traffic
school
if
you
can
if
its
a
serious
matter
get
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
can
present
the
exact
same
case
as
you
the
difference
is

there

the

at

essentially
the

up
to

note
that
the
volume
of
gas
that

flow
through

is
much
larger
than
the
volume
that

through
the

because
of
the
temperature
difference
and
the
products
of
combustion
in
the
last

the
japanese

have
started
paying
attention
to

at

point
in

substitution

an

freeflow

the

in

the

is
much
louder
than
the

on
older

exhaust
backpressure
was
the
dominating
factor
if
freeflowing

were
substituted
very
little
difference
was
noted
unless
a
freeflowing

was
installed
as
well
in

an

can
be
visualized
as
an

pump
at
any
given
rpm
anything
that
will
cause
the
engine
to

more
air
be
it
on

have

degree

that
any

could
be

hazardous
to

tie
wrapping
between
the

frame
and
the

steel
tube

used
to
support
the

you
have
to
remove
the

to
do
this

it
fits
outside
of
the

but
inside
the

on
the
two
vertical
supports
just
in
front
of

depending
how
tight
your

follows
the

you
should
be
able
to
fit
it
somewhere
in

the

is
about
in
diameter
and
about
long
the

mounted
on
the

of
the

it
is
small
so
there
should
be
plenty
of
good
places
for

i
found
a
perfect
place
for
the

that
required
only
tie

to
mount
the
horns
fit
inside
the

and
stick
out
on
either
side
just
in
front
of
the
air
scoops
but
behind
the
turn
signals
the
back
of
the
horns
point
back
towards
the
center
of
the
bike
and
come
real
close
to
where
the
gas
tank
connects
to
the
front
part
of
the
frame
there
is
just
enough
room
to
the
outside
to
allow
full
lock
to
lock
clearance
and
there
are
nice
cut
outs
in
the
frame
for
the
back
of
the
horn
to
go
into
the
short
horn
is
even
with
the
fairing
and
the
long
one
sticks
out
about
an
inch
or
so
but
it
is
really
not
that
noticable
unless
you
look
closely
they
end
up
pointing
down
slightly
and
maybe
degrees
from
straight
ahead

for

we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explanations
for
why
one
can
use
the
handlebars
to
lean
a
moving
motorcycle
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
dominant
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experiment
which
would
seaprate
the
two
characteristics
and
see
which
effect
produces
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
us
who
have
bikes
are
familiar
as
you
point
out
the
experiments
would
be
difficult
but
we
know
enough
about
the
physics
of
the
situation
to
do
some
calculations
there
are
in
fact
three
effects
contributing
to
leaning
the
bike
over
to
begin
a
turn
gyro
effect
causing
a
torque
which
twists
the
bike
over
contact
patch
having
shifted
to
one
side
causing
bike
to
fall
over
contact
patch
being
accelerated
to
the
side
causing
a
torque
which
twists
the
bike
over
take
an
average
bikerider
average
bike
wheel
and
at
speeds
of
and
mph
say
calculate
how
much
twist
of
the
bars
would
be
needed
to
produce
say
degrees
of
lean
in
say
seconds
by
each
effect
alone
my
guess
is
that
at
slow
speeds
is
dominant
and
at
high
speeds
is
dominant
and
at
all
speeds
contributes
not
far
off
bugger
all
relatively
speaking
by
the
way
a
similar
problem
is
this
how
does
a
runner
who
wants
to
run
round
a
corner
get
leaned
into
the
corner
fast
is
there
a
running
group
where
we
could
start
counterfooting
arguments
and
have
them
all
falling
over
as
they
tried
to
work
out
how
they
go

remember
to
wear
at

the

gets
lucky
and
sinks
his

into

would

its
useful
to
learn
how
to
read
a
dogs
body

how
you
react
to
a
dog
who
is
chasing
you
because
he
thinks
its
a
game
and
that
youre
playing
with
him
is
completely
different
from
how
you
react
to
a
dog
which
has
hostile
intent
third
its
useful
to
learn
how
to
present
yourself
to
a
dog
dogs
are
social
beasts
and
recognize
a
dominationsubmission
hierarchy
to
a
dog
there
are
two
types
of
fellowcreatures
that
which
he
dominates
and
that
which
dominate
him
you
need
to
unambiguously
represent
yourself
as
being
of
the
latter
class
you
are
god
you
are
easily
angered
and
your
anger
is
terrible
but
god
is
also
amused
by
one
who
properly
submits
to
his
dominance
and
may
even
on
rare
occasions
dispense
a
kind
word
a
kind
word
or
even
oh

oh
rapture
unforeseen
a
dog
bisquit
now
how
does
that
all
relate
to
biking
well
first
its
a
good
idea
to
assume
that
most
dogs
who
chase
motorcycles
do
so
because
they
think
its
a
game
and
not
out
of
overt
hostility
the
msf
suggestion
is
a
very
good
one
when
you
see
the
dog
coming
slow
down
so
he
determines
a
particular
place
of
interception
just
before
you
and
he
reach
that
spot
punch
the
throttle
so
that
when
he
reaches
it
youre
already
long
gone
dogs
take
a
few
seconds
to
react
to
new
input
and
definitely
cannot
comprehend
the
acceleration
that
a
motorcycle
is
capable
of
with
a
hostile
dog
or
one
which
you
repeatedly
encounter
stronger
measures
may
be
necessary
this
is
the
face
off
first
and
there
is
very
important
make
sure
you
never
face
off
a
dog
on
his
territory
face
him
off
on
the
road
not
on
his
driveway
if
necessary
have
a
large
stick
rolled
up
newspaper
etc
something
the
beast
will
understand
is
something
that
will
hurt
him
stand
your
ground
then
slowly
advance
your
mental
attitude
is
that
you
are
very
angry
and
are
going
to
dispense
terrible
punishment
the
larger
the
dog
the
greater
your
anger
dogs
will
pick
up
anger
just
as
they
can
pick
up
fear
and
since
you
and
he
are
not
on
his
home
territory
it
may
suddenly
dawn
on
the
dog
that
perhaps
he
is
on
your
territory
and
that
you
are
prepared
to
fight
to
the
death
most
dogs
will
decide
that
it
is
a
good
idea
to
retreat
to
their
own
territory
where
there
is
at
least
a
home
advantage
theyll
also
observe
that
you
are
satisfied
by
that
retreat
gesture
of
submission
and
thus
they
have
escaped
punishment
the
interesting
thing
about
dogs
is
that
body
language
communicates
a

be

too
much

that
if

had

all
over
again
that

would
have

both
on

may

insurance
companies
sure
seem

are
the

doesnt
this
imply
that
we
would
have
to
pay
much
higher
rates
under
a
nofault
system
with
a
carsonly
system
it
seems
to
make
sense
on
the
surface
take
the
legal
costs
out
of
the
system
but
it
looks
like
motorcyclists
would
get
screwed
yup
unfortunately
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
cost
of
insurance
does
not
go
down
with
no
fault
the
crappiest
drivers
make
out
like
bandits
because
they
no
longer
have
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
paying
for
insurance
that
they
have
boosted
in
price
for
themselves
by
being
crappy
drivers
the
good
drivers
now
pay
through
the
nose
to
spread
the
cost
of
the
crappy
drivers
actions
and
thats
not
fair
any
plan
that
caps
rates
for
crappy
drivers
is
inherently
a
piece
of
shit
because
the
rest
of
us
end
up
paying
more
any
plan
that
uses
speeding
tickets
as
a
basis
for
raising
rates
is
also
a
piece
of
shit
as
it
is
based
upon
the
lie
that
faster
drivers
are
inherently
less
safe
than
slower
drivers

that
you
replace

of
the
sport
cruiserbike
riders
have
a
different
view
of
motorcycling
than
those
of
sport
bike
riders
what
they
like
and
dislike
about
motorcycling
this
is
not
closedminded
and
what
view
exactly
is
it
that
every
single
rider
of
cruiser
bikes
holds
a
veiw
that
of
course
no
sportbike
rider
could
possibly
hold
please
quantify
your

for

careful
now
youre

pigeonhole

all

changing

the

completely
arbitrary
simple

could
make
it
work
either

this
supports
the

this

the

to
me
that
jetskis

even

it

is
an
additional
factor

splitfire
plugs
kinda
offical
yo
whaz
up
earlier
i
was
reading
on
the
net
about
using
splitfire
plugs
one
guy
was
thinking
about
it
and
almost
everybody
shot
him
to
hell
well
i
saw
one
think
that
someone
said
about
show
me
a
team
that
used
split
fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
increased
performance
by
increasing
torque
they
werent
focusing
on
horsepower
numbers
now
how
does
this
related
to
us
high
performance
pilots
well
that
depends
do
you
pilot
a
high
performance
or
machine
in
the
case
of
splitfires
would
increase
overall
torque
but
make
more
top
end
horsepower
with
its
torque
packed
down
low
so
for
splitfires
would
not
significantly
increase
power
but
what
about
twins
many
of
you
guys
laugh
at
some
of
us
twins
but
many
times
we
carry
less
weight
which
sometimes
can
make
up
for
the
hp
loss
see
doug
polen
vs
scott
russell
daytona
however
twins
make
more
torque
thoughout
their
powerbands
so
how
does
this
translate
increased
torque
should
theoretically
help
twins
make
more
power
splitfire
claims
that
there
should
be
not
extra
mods
or
anything
made
just
stick
em
in
now
i
dont
know
about
all
of
this
and
im
trying
to
catch
up
with
somebody
about
it
now
but
splitfires
should
help
twins
more
than
as
far
as
racing

you

when
you
go

these

if
your
tastes
tend
to
smaller
more
petite
cough
churchgoers
it
is
more
likely
that
they
will
have
a
smaller
head
and
you
can
safely
get
a
medium
or
small
helmet
this
works
for
me
and
i
traded
my
spare
large
helmet
with
my
best
friend
who
at
tends
to
look
more
for
women
that
are
over
and
cant
usually
fit
into
the
medium
size
helmet
he
previously
had
of
course
if
you
arent
picky
what
size
cough
churchgoers
you
give
helpful
motorcycle
rides
to
then
eds
advice
will
hopefully
cover
any
eventuality
as
far
as
legality
is
concerned
and
a
spare
handtowel
in
the
tankbag
makes
acceptable
padding
so
the
passenger
can
see
out
of
the
viewport
rather
than
the
padding
above
the
viewport

the
cases

ive
had

this
doesnt

i
am
thinking
about
new

the

from
a

does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
for
a
fix
besides
restoring
it

why
would
that
fix
it
you
still
have
to
get
the
jetting
right
to

what
seems
to
be
a
extremely
overly
lean
condition
you
added
a
more
free
flowing
exhaust
and
then
higher
flowing
filters
chances
are
its
to
lean
but
this
may
not
bethats
the
big
fun
with
carb
tuning
its
very
tricky
your
one
and
only
choice
unless
you
want
to
spend
many
hours
fiddling
with
the
carbs
is
to
take
it
to
a
guy
witha
dyno
and
have
he
tune
the

for

set

otherwise

the

i

hi
don

yet
i
ride
anything

continuously
on
this
forum
and
on

street
you
find
quite
a
difference
between
the
opinions
of
what
motorcycling
is
to
different
individuals
yes
yes
yes
motorcycling
is
slightly
different
to
each
and
every
one
of
us
this
is
the
nature
of
people
and
one
of
the
beauties
of
the
sport
cruiserbike
riders
have
a
different
view
of
motorcycling
than
those
of
sport
bike
riders
what
they
like
and
dislike
about
motorcycling
this
is
not
closedminded
and
what
view
exactly
is
it
that
every
single
rider
of
cruiser
bikes
holds
a
veiw
that
of
course
no
sportbike
rider
could
possibly
hold
please
quantify
your
generalization
for
us
careful
now
youre
trying
to
pigeonhole
a
whole
bunch
of
people
that
plastic
bodywork
is
useless
that
torque
and
an
upright
riding
position
is
better
than
a
slightly
or
radically
forward
riding
position
combined
with
a
highrpm
low
torque
motor
to
a
cruisermotorcyclist
chrome
has
some
importance
to
sportbike
motorcyclists
chrome
has
very
little
impact
on
buying
choice
unless
motivated
solely
by
price
these
are
the
criteria
each
rider
uses
to
select
the
vehicle
of
choice
to
ignore
these
as
well
as
other
criteria
would
be
insensitive
in
other
words
no
one
motorcycle
can
fufill
the
requirements
that
a
sportbike
rider
and
a
cruiser
rider
may
havesometimes
its
hard
for
any
motorcycle
to
fufill
a
persons
requirements
youre

the

it
cost
me
about
for
portland
to

of
that
was

all
i
had
to

is
ride
it
to
the
shipping
dock
and
siphon
the

out
i

they
can
also
pick
up
the

from

business
the
bike
arrived
ontime
at

all
i
had
to

was
adjust

the

was

theyre

going
again
as
possible
i
have
everything
under

i

i
know

if
i
buy
a

tender
for
each
one
and
leave
them
plugged
in
the
whole
time
the
bikes
are
in
storage
theyll
be
fine
but
im
not
sure
thats
necessary
ive
never
heard
anyone
discussing
this
idea
so
maybe
theres
some
reason
why
it
isnt
so
great
but
maybe
someone
can
tell
me
would
it
be
a
mistake
to
fully
charge
the
batteries
drain
the
electrolyte
into
separate
containers
one
for
each
battery
seal
the
container
close
up
the
batteries
and
leave
them
that
way
then
it
would
seem
that
when
the
bikes
come
out
of
storage
i
could
put
the
electrolyte
back
in
the
batteries
and
they
should
still
be
fully
charged

value
in

i
didnt
say
there
was
no
value
all
i
said
was
that
it
is
very
confusing
to
newbies
theres
a
big
difference
in
knowing
whats
happening
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
especially
in
the
extreme
case
of
an
emergency
swerve
and
just
letting
the
bike
do
whatever
it
does
to
make
itself
turn
once
i
knew
precisely
what
was
happening
and
how
to
make
it
do
it
abruptly
and
on
command
my
emergency
avoidance
abilities
improved
tenfold
not
to
mention
a
big
improvement
in
my
normal
cornering
ability
i
am
much
more
proficient
knowing
how
to
countersteer
the
motorcycle
rather
than
letting
the
motorcycle
steer
itself
that
is
when
i
remember
to
take
cognitive
command
of
the
bike
rather
than
letting
it
run
itself
through
the
corners
whereupon
i
return
to
my
original
comment
better
to
learn
whats
happening
right
from
the
start
and
how
to
take
charge
of
it
rather
than
developing
the
bad
habit
of
merely
going
along
for
the
ride
bill
you
are
kidding
yourself
here
firstly
motorcycles
do
not
steer
themselves
only
the
rider
can
do
that
secondly
it
is
the
adhesion
of
the
tyre
on
the
road
the
suspension
geometry
and
the
ground
clearance
of
the
motorcycle
which
dictate
how
quickly
you
can
swerve
to
avoid
obstacles
and
not
the
knowledge
of
physics
between
the
riders
ears
are
you
seriously
suggesting
that
countersteering
knowledge
enables
you
to
corner
faster
or
more
competently
than
you
could
manage
otherwise
mike
im
extremely
gratified
for
you
that
you
have
such
a
natural
affinity
and
prowess
for
motorcycling
that
formal
training
was
a
total
waste
of
time
for
you
assuming
your
total
training
hasnt
come
from
simply
from
reading
recmotorcycles
however
of
the
motorcyclists
ive
discussed
formal
rider
education
with
have
regarded
the
experience
as
overwhelmingly
positive
this
regardless
of
the
amount
of
experience
they
brought
into
the
course
ranging
from
minutes
to
years
formal
training
in
this
country
as
far
as
i
am
aware
does
not
include
countersteering
theory
i
found
out
about
countersteering
about
six
years
ago
from
a
physics
lecturer
who
was
also
a
motorcyclist
i
didnt
believe
him
at
first
when
he
said
i
steered
my
bike
to
the
right
to
make
it
turn
left
but
i
went
out
and
analysed
closely
what
i
was
doing
and
realized
he
was
right
its
an
interesting
bit
of
knowledge
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
fun
since
then
telling
others
about
it
who
were
at
first
as
sceptical
as
i
was
but
thats
all
it
is
an
interesting
bit
of
knowledge
and
to
claim
that
it
is
essential
for
all
bikers
to
know
it
or
that
you
can
corner
faster
or
better
as
a
result
is
absurd
formal
training
is
in
my
view
absolutely
essential
if
youre
going
to
be
able
to
ride
a
bike
properly
and
safely
but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for
them
to
learn
and
that
was

point

it
looks

the

also

my

is
whether
the
degree

have

as
i
can
its
normal
for
the

k
bikes
to
use
a
little
oil
in
the
first
few
thousand
miles
i
dont
know
why
ive
had
three
new
k
bikes
and
all
three
used
a

when
new
max
maybe
quart
in
first
miles
this
soon
quits
and
by
the
time
i
had
miles
on
them
the
oil
consumption
was
about
zero
ive
been
told
that
the
harder
you
run
the
bike
within
reason
the
sooner
it
stops
using
any
oil

with

of

effective
emergency
avoidance
manuvers
this
is
really
the
only
thing
we
disagree
on
maybe
we
should
agree
to
disagree
i
still
think
that
telling
newbies
to
steer
left
to
turn
to
the
right
is
unnecessarily
confusing
when
theyll
do
it
anyway
if
they
just
get
on
the
bike
and
ride
the
damn
thing
i
know
exactly
whats
happening
its
those
other
gits
that
havent
a
clue
me
too
understanding
the
physics
of
traction
is
fine
but
i
cannot
see
how
detailed
theory
like
that
has
any
place
in
a
motorcyle
training
course
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
maximum
traction
is
obtained
with
the
tyre
just
beginning
to
slide
against
the
road
then
we
are
in
violent
disagreement
while
what
you
state
is
true
it
is
insufficient
to
form
a
traction
management
policy
available
traction
increases
with
applied
normal
force
ie
traction
available
to
the
front
wheel
increases
as
weight
shifts
under
braking
forces
and
correspondingly
decreases
at
the
rear
thus
a
technique
of
applying
both
brakes
and
easing
off
the
rear
and
increasing
pressure
on
the
front
can
best
be
learned
with
an
understanding
of
weight
shift
and
available
traction
jeez
ed
when
you
started
talking
about
traction
management
policies
i
thought
you
were
making
some
weird
reference
to
looking
after
railway
locomotives
the
official
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubts
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
applied
first
followed
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
being
that
you
avoid
locking
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
takes
place
in
practice
i
suspect
most
people
do
what
you
describe
saying
brake
until
the
tire
just
begins
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advice
to
a
newbie
he
has
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
gives
him
zero
information
from
which
to
develop
a
braking
technique
that
changes
as
the
braking
and
corresponding
weight
shift
develop
if
you
dont
slide
the
tyre
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
youve
achieved
maximum
braking
or
not
im
not
suggesting
that
you
should
always
aim
to
brake
as
hard
as
you
possibly
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limits
of
the
machine
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
in
any
case
for
maximum
braking
if
as
i
suggested
you
aim
to
keep
both
wheels
just
on
the
point
of
sliding
then
youll
be
doing
exactly
as
you
suggest

how

in

of
traffic
jerks
ive
found
that
an
effective
strategy
is
to
flash
my
brake
light
by
pumping
the
pedal
you
will
obviously
need
a
bit
of

play
in
your

pedal
to
do
this
it
seems
that
even
the
most

can
usually
discern
that
a
flashing
red
light
directly
in

reminds
me
of
a
great
editorial
by
bruce
reeve
a
couple
months
ago
in
cycle
canada
he
was
so
pissed
off
with
cops
pulling
over
speeders
in
dangerous
spots
and
often
blind
corners
that
one
day
he
decided
to
get
revenge
cruising
on
a
factory
loaner
test
bike
he
noticed
a
cop
had
pulled
over
a
motorist
on
an
on
or
off
ramp
with
almost
no
shoulder
being
a
bright
lad
he
hit
his
bikes
kill
switch
just
before
passing
the
cop
who
happened
to
be
bending
towards
the
offending
motorist
thereby
exposing
his
glutes
to
the
passing
world
with
his
ignition
system
now
dead
he
pumped
his
throtle
two
or
three
times
to
fill
his
exhaust
canisters
with
volatile
raw
fuel
all
it
took
was
a
stab
at
the
kill
switch
to
relight
the
ignition
and
send
a
flame
in
sargeant
swells
direction
i
wonder
if
any
cycle
cops
read
cycle
canada
although
i
agree
with
the
spirit
of
the
action
i
do
hope
that
the
rider
ponied
up
the
or
so
it
takes
to
replace
the
exhaust
system
he
just
destroyed
the
owners
manual
explicitly
warns
against
such
behavior
for
exactly
that
reason
you
can
destroy
your
muflers
that
way
later

might

wear
the
even
after

it
is
far
better
than
no

or
a
poorly
fitting
one
ive
had
many
scratches
bangs
which
have
been
repaired
plus
im
still
confident
of
the
protection
the
helmet
will
continue
to
give
me
only
when
you
actually
see
depressions
or
actual
cracks
using
a
magnifying
glass
should
you
consider
replacement
this
is
not
good
advice
a
couple
of
years
i
was
involved
in
a
lowspeed
getoff
in
which
i
landed
on
my
back
on
the
pavement
my
head
helmeted
hit
the
pavement
with
a
clunk
leaving
a
couple
of
dings
and
chips
in
the
paint
at
the
point
of
impact
but
no
other
visible
damage
i
called
the
helmet
manufacturer
and
inquired
about
damage
they
said
that
the
way
a
fiberglass
shell
works
is
to
first
give
then
delaminate
then
crack
this
is
the
way
fiberglass
serves
to
spread
the
force
of
the
impact
over
a
wider
area
after
the
fiberglass
has
done
its
thing
the
crushable
foam
liner
takes
care
of
absorbing
hopefully
the
remaining
impact
force
they
told
me
that
the
second
stage
of
fiberglass
functionality
delamination
of
the
glassresin
layers
can
occur
with
no
visible
signs
either
inside
or
outside
of
the
helmet
they
suggested
that
i
send
them
the
helmet
and
they
would
inspect
it
including
xraying
i
did
so
they
sent
back
the
helmet
with
a
letter
stating
that
that
they
could
find
no
damage
that
would
compromise
the
ability
of
the
helmet
to
provide
maximum
protection
i
suspect
that
this
letter
would
eliminate
their
being
able
to
claim
prior
damage
to
the
helmet
in
the
event
i
were
to
sue
them
the
bottom
line
though
is
that
it
appears
that
a
helmets
integrity
can
be
compromised
with
no
visible
signs
the
only
way
to
know
for
sure
is
to
send
it
back
and
have
it
inspected
note
that
some
helmet
manufacturers
provide
inspections
services
and
some
do
not

re

dog
attack
several
years
ago
while
driving
a
cage
a
dog
darted
out
at
a
quiet
intersection
right
in
front
of
me
but
there
was
enough
distance
between
us
so
i
didnt
have
to
slow
down
however
a
dog
suddenly
appeared
and
collided
with
my
right
front
bumper
and
the
force
of
the
impact
was
enough
to
kill
that
scottish
terrier
apparently
it
was
following
the
dog
henceforth
if
a
dog
decides
to
cross
the
street
keep
an
eye
out
for
a
dog
as
many
dogs
like
to
travel
in
pairs
or
packs
ive
yet
to
experience
a
dog
chasing
me
on
my
black
which
has
a
pretty
loud
oem
horn
not
as
good
as
fiamms
but
good
enuff
but
the
bike
is
large
and
heavy
enough
to
run
right
over
one
of
the
smaller
nippers
while
the
larger
ones
would
have
trouble
getting
my
leg
between
the
saddlebags
and
engine
guards
id
def
feel
more
vulnerable
on

as
thatd
be
easier
leg
chewing
target
for
those
mongrels
if
theres
a
persistent
dog
running
after
bikers
despite
complaints
to
the
owner
i
wouldnt
be
adverse
to
running
over
it
with
my
truck
as
a
dogs
life
isnt
worth
much
imho
compared
to
a
child
riding
a
bike
who
gets
knocked
to
the
ground
by
said
dog
and
dies
from
a
head
injury
any
dog
in

help
which
bikes
are
short
help
ive
got
a
friend
shopping
for
her
first
motorcycle
this
is
great
unfortunately
she
needs
at
most
a
seat
this
is
not
great
so
far
the
only
thing
weve
found
was
an
old
and
unhappylooking
so
its
time
to
tap
the
collective
memory
of
all
the
denizens
out
there
anybody
know
of
models
old
models
and
used
bikes
are
not
a
problem
with
a
or
lower
seat
and
since
she
has
to
make
this
difficult
she
would
prefer
not
to
end
up
with
a
cruiser
so
theres
bonus
points
for
listing
tiny
standards
i
seem
to
remember
a
thread

hi
i
have
an
custom
that
i
just
replaced
the
cylinder
head
gasket
on
now
when
i
put
it
back
together
again
it
wouldnt
idle
at
all
it
was
only
running
on
cylinders
and
it
would
backfire
and
spit
flames
out
the
exhaust
on
the
right
side
the
exhaust
is
mac
i
bought
new
plugs
today
and
it
runs
very
rough
and
still
wont
idle
i
am
quite
sure
the
fine
tune
knobs
on
the
carbs
are
messed
up
i
checked
the
timing
it
was
fine
so
i
advanced
it
a
little
and
that
didnt
help
i
assume
the
carbs
need
to
be
synched
can
i
buy
a
kit
and
do
this
myself
if
so
what
kit
is
the
best
for
the
price
any
other
suggestions
i
dont
think
its
the
carbs
that
are
out
i
would
suspect
that
the
cam
timing
is
out

ive
found
that
an
effective
strategy
is
to
flash
my

by
pumping
the
pedal
you
will
obviously
need
a
bit
of

play
in
your

pedal
to
do
this
it
seems
that
even
the

discern
that
a

light
directly
in

may
mean
that
something
is
wrong
the
two
problems
id
see
with
your
strategy
is
that
the
red
light
may
change
before
you
can
get
anything
meaningful
out

the

hello
everyone
im
new
to
motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
in
dc
as
i
imagine
it
is
in
every
other
state
ok
ok
were
not
a
state
were
not
bitter
you
take
the

test
first
and
then
get
a
learners
permit
however
im
wondering
how
one
goes
about
learning
to
ride
the
bike
proficiently
enough
so
as
to
a
get
a
liscence
and
b
not
kill
oneself
i
dont
know
anyone
with
a
bike
who
could
teach
me
and
the
most
advice
ive
heard
is
either
do
you
live
near
a
field
or
do
you
have
a
friend
with
a
pickup
truck
the
answers
to
both
of
which
are
no
do
i
just
ride
around
my
neighborhood
and
hope
for
the
best
i
kind
of
live
in
a
residential
area
but
its
not

its
still

formal

properly

but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for

and
that
was

mike
while
i
agree
with
you
on
that
formal
training
is
essential
for
safe
riding
i
disagree
strongly
with
your
original
point
the
point
of
formal
training
must
be
to
prepare
riders
for
the
road
preparedness
is
in
my
opinion
to
know
as
much
as
possible
so
to
exclude
some
aspects
of
riding
a
bike
in
a
course
is
wrong
imho
now
to
countersteering
in
particular
countersteering
is
something
that
must
be
trained
a
common
reaction
among
new
bikers
or
bicycle
riders
in
an
emergency
situation
is
to
steer
the
motorcycle
like
a
bicycle
as
we
know
this
makes
the
motorcycle
go
in
the
direction
opposite
to
what
was
intended
needless
to
say
this
is
dangerous
i
have
a
specific
example
a
rider
in
a
left
turn
the
rider
thinks
heshe
is
to
close
to
the
right
shoulder
of
the
road
and
tries
to
steer
the
motorcycle
to
the
left
by
pulling
the
left
handle
and
pushing
the
right
handle
the

rider
tries
to
steer
the
motorcycle
away
from
the
truck
and
crashes
right
into
it
the
main
function
of
a
riding
course
is
to
teach
how
to
avoid
emergency
situations
and
what
to
do
if
in

thus
the
knowledge

training

the

hello
everyone
im
new

motorcycles
so
no
flames
please
i
dont
have
my
bike
yet
so
i
need
a
few
pieces
of
information
any
stories
on
how
you
all
learned
ill
tell
you
my
story
as
an
example
of
what
not
to
do
early
in
i
took
some
riding
lessons
from
my
college
roommate
on
his
old
honda
he
had
taken
the
msf
beginners
course
so
i
actually
learned
some
of
what
i
needed
to
know
to
ride
i
proceeded
to
buy
a
beatup
honda
for
and
a
helmet
and
rode
around
wearing
this
and
a
cotton
windbreaker
then
i
decided
to
invest
in
a
fullface
helmet
first
smart
move
sometime
around
then
i
also
passed
my
road
test
on
may
i
got
caught
in
a
rainstorm
on
my
way
home
from
a
trip
entering
the
town
where
i
lived
a
rather
urban
suburb
i
had
to
stop
suddenly
for
a
red
light
that
i
noticed
too
late
skidded
the
rear
tire
out
and
was
ejected
face
upward
into
the
oncoming
lane
of
traffic
fortunately
for
me
the
oncoming
traffic
was
also
stopped
for
the
same
red
light
otherwise
i
might
have
slid
under
a
car
and
been
killed
now
this
is
anecdotal
evidence
to
be
sure
but
i
later
took
the
experienced
rider
course
from
the
msf
and
saw
that
earlier
training
could
have
helped
me
greatly
in
your
case
the
need
is
even
greater
since
you
have
nobody
to
help
you
practice
even
the
most
basic
stuff
as
i
did
so
my
advice
is
to
take
the
msf
beginners
course
first
thing
i
wouldnt
even
buy
a
bike
until
youve
taken
the
course
unless
you
happen
to
pick
up
a
real
good
deal
and
can
store
it
someplace
until
youre
ready
to
use
it
i
only
have
about
to
work
with
so
that
would
have
to
cover
everything
bike
helmet
anything
else
that
im
too
ignorant
to
know
i
need
to
buy
while
youre
waiting
to
take
the
course
it
might
take
a
few
weeks
in
dc
as
i
recall
there
were
always
waiting
lists
in
boston
could
you
save
up
some
more
money
to
start
out
right
say
for
riding
gear
plus
the
cost
bike
plus
maybe
guess
to
a
mechanic
to
make
sure
the
machine
is
safe
assuming
you
economize
by
buying
some
old
beatup
machine
from
a
private
individual
plus
insurance
plus
registration
and
licensing
fees
plus
the
course
youre
looking
at
maybe
not
including
the
bike
itself
and
a
reserve
for
ongoing
maintenance
what
is
buying
a
bike
going
to
do
to
my
insurance
i
turn
in
about
a
month
so
my
parents
have
been
taking
care
of
my
insurance
up
till
now
and
i
need
a
comprehensive
list
of
costs
that
buying
a
motorcycle
is
going
to
insure
i
live
in
washington
dc
if
that
makes
a
difference
i
pay
about
insurance
now
upstate
ny
but
it
was
closer
to
in
boston
more
urban
for
decent
insurance
including
substantial
coverage
for
liability
which
you
want
unless
you
plan
always
to
be
poor
id
guess
dc
is
more
like
boston
than
like
a
rural
area
ergo
more
expensive
any
recommendations
on
what
i
should
buywhere
i
should
look
for
it
there
used
to
be
annual
buyers
guides
in
the
usual
motorcycle
magazines
i
found
those
helpful
in
getting
an
idea
of
what
new
or
recent
models
might
be
available
you
could
probably
look
through
past
issues
to
size
up
what
used
bikes
might
be
available
my
first
bike
was
years
old
when
i
bought
it
so
i
went
on
my
friends
advice
instead
also
look
at
the
bikes
that
you
see
people
riding
or
that
are
parked
on
the
street
i
basically
settled
on
my

bike
by
noticing
that
there
were
a
lot
of
highmileage
bmws
running
around
and
they
were
generally
set
up
the
way
i
wanted
nothing
wrong
with
talking
to
various
dealers
in
your
area
or
visiting
showrooms
dealers
in
the
boston
area
at
least
when
i
was
shopping
were
very
nice
about
letting
you
look
around
their
showrooms
and
quoting
prices
for
bikes
that
werent
the
latest
models
hence
cheaper
although
i
ended
up
buying
both
bikes
in
private
sales

has
anyone

who
in

incidentally
the
best
lock
ive
found
for
bikes
is
the
cobra
lock
its
a
cable
which
is
shrouded
by
an
articulated
hardened
steel
sleeve
the
lock
itself
is
cylindrical
and
the
locking
pawl
engages
the
joints
at
the
articulation
points
so
the
chain
can
be
adjusted
like
handcuffs
you
cant
get
any
leverage
on
the
lock
to
break
it
open
and
the
cylinder
is
wellprotected
i
wouldnt
want
to
cut
one
of
these
without
a
torch
andor
a
vice
and
heavy
duty
cutting
wheel
i
have
a
long
cobralinks
lock
that
i
used
to
use
for
my
harley
she
doesnt
get
out
much
anymore
so
i
dont
use
the
lock
that
often
anymore
it
is
made
of
articulated
steel
shells
covering
seven
strands
of
steel
cable
it
is
probably
enough
to
stop
all
the
joyriders
but
unfortunately
professionals
can
open
it
rather
easily
freeze
a
link
break
frozen
link
with
your
favorite
method
hammers
work
well
snip
through
the
steel
cables
which
i
have
on
authority
are
frightfully
thin
with
a
set
of
boltcutters
for
the
same
money
you
can
get
a
kryptonite
cable
lock
which
is
anywhere
from
to
thick
steel
cable
looks
like
steel
rope
shielded
in
a
flexible
covering
to
protect
your
bikes
finish
and
has
a
barreltype
locking
mechanism
i
dont
know
if
its
adjustable
but
my
source
says
its
more
difficult
to
pick
than
most
locks
and
the
cable
tends
to
squish
flat
in
boltcutter
jaws
rather
than
shear
model
all
bets
are
off
if
the
thief
has
a

with

even
the

or
higher
maybe
not

which
is

more
comfortable
keeps
the

out
better
is
quieter
but
might
have
some
minor
damage
id
wear
the
full
facer
but
then
id
be
way
more
worried
about
wind
blast
in
the
face
and
inability
to
hear
police
sirens
than
the
helmet
being
a
little
damaged
also
what
would
you
all
reccomend
as
far
as
good
helmets
im
slightly
disappointed
by
how
badly
the
shoei
has
scratched
etc
from
not
being
bloody
careful
about
it
and
how
little
impact
it
took
to
chip
the
paint
and
arguably
mess
it
up
period
looking
at

really
good

with

protection
i
like
the
shoei
style
kinda
like
the
norton
one
i
saw
awhile
back
too

suspect
im
going

have
to
get

i
want

every

im

i

tuchuses
i
dont
know
how
much
the
teaching
of
countersteering
in
the
beginner
course
really
helps
the
tuchus
steerers
i
was
one
i
guess
that
i
always
steered
a
bicycle
that
way
and
i
only
got
the
hang
of
countersteering
in
normal
riding
after
the
course
i
could
do
the
countersteering
swerves
in
the
course
no
problem
but
i
only
started
using
it
in
my
normal
riding
when
i
decided
that
my
turning
at
speed
offramps
and
the
like
was
a
lot
more
difficult
that
it
should
have
been
i
knew
how
it
works
although
thats
currently
up
for
debate
definitely
knew
that
it
works
as
i
could
do
it
in
swerves
but
only
figured
it
out
later
in
my
normal
riding
just
a
data
point
i
think
that
its
not
a
bad
idea
to
bring
the
idea
up
but
its
best
to
let
everyone
tuchussteer
for
the
first
lesson
or
two
so
they
can
learn
to
shift
gears
before
they
have
to
worry
about
proper
handlebar
technique
countersteering
in
fact
my
experienced
rider
course
instructors
claimed
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
turn
to
whichever
side
they
wanted
just
by
shifting
their
weight
around
even
when
the
operator
was
trying
to
turn
in
the
opposite
direction
i
admit
ive
never
actually
seen
this
i
have
in
our
beginner
course
we
had
passenger
training
sometime
during
the
lesson
the
instructor
would
hop
on
the
back
of
the
bike
and
the
student
would
take
him
for
a
ride
if
the
student
did
not
give
the
instructor
the
you
are
a
sack
of
potatoes
passenger
speech
the
instructor
would
steer
the
bike
and
make
a
general
nuisance
of
himself
it
was
amusing
to
watch
im
just
happy
that
it
didnt
happen

on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
i
owned
a
bieffe
offroad
helmet
took
what
i
would
consider
a
minor
fall
and
had
visible
damage
to
the
shell
yes
the
helmet
did
its
job
but
the
damageimpact
ratio
was
scary
i
own
bell
now
have
taken
impacts
on
order
of
twice
the
bieffe
impact
we
do
this
frequently
in
mx
and
dont
even
have
a
scratch
on
it
after
two
seasons
my
recommendation
is
to
buy
high
quality
gear
ymmv
when
your
helmetted
nogin
hits
an
immoveabe
object
there
are
only
four
things
to
dissipate
the
energy
the
immoveable
object
the
helmet
shell
the
helmet
liner
the
riders
head
the
riders
ego
ok
five
assuming
that
the
helmet
head
assembly
takes
the
same
impact
if
the
shell
cracks
in
one
case
then
in
the
other
the
liner
must
be
dented
or
the
head
gets
jiggled
if
its
the
the
liner
thats
dented
the
helmet
is
just
as
toast
as
if
the
shell
were
cracked
it
wont
absorb
energy
form
an
impact
in
that
area
if
its
the
head
thats
getting
jiggled
maybe
the
new
gear
isnt
of
as
high
quality
after
all

i

monster
of

it
didnt
have
the
initial
power
burst
to
just
twist
it
into

i
had

pop
the

i
also
had

this

no

fix

there

not

your

should
fit

this

isnt
quite

i
encountered

i
must
have
missed
the
article
on
the
spagthorpe
viking
was
dsthat
the
one
with
the
little
illuminated

head
on
the
front
dsfender
a
style
later
copied
by
indian
and
the
round
side
covers
no
not
at
all
the
viking
was
a
trick
little
unit
made
way
back
when
forties
fifties
when
spag
was
trying
to
make
a
go
of
it
in
racing
the
first
iteration
the
springer
was
a
boxer
twin
very
similar
to
max
frizs
famous
design
but
with
an
overhead
point
cam
see
below
for
more
on
the
valvetrain
the
problem
was
that
the
thing
had
no
ground
clearance
whatsoever
the
solution
was
to
curve
the
cylinder
bores
so
that
the
ground
clearance
was
substantially
increased
springer
motor
front
viking
motor
front
this
is
roughly
the
idea
except
that
the
bores
were
gradually
curved
around
a
radius
as
the
pistons
were
loath
to
make
a
sharpangled
turn
in
the
middle
of
their
stroke
the
engine
also
had
curved
connecting
rods
to
accomodate
the
stroke
the
engine
stuck
out
so
far
because
of
its
revolutionary
and
still
unique
overhead
cam
system
through
the
use
of
clever
valve
timing
and
and
extrordinarily
trick
valve
linkage
only
a
single
cam
lobe
was
required
to
drive
both
overhead
valves
just
as
revolutionary
was
the
hydraulic
valve
actuation
which
used
a
pressurized
stream
of
oil
to
power
the
waterwheel
which
kept
the
lobe
spinning
over
one
side
effect
that
required
some
rather
brutal
engineering
fixes
was
that
until
the
engines
oil
pressure
came
up
to
normal
the
engines
valve
timing
would
be
more
or
less
random
resulting
in
some
impressive
startup
valve
damage
the
solution
was
a
little
hand
crank
that
pressurized
the
cases
before
you
started
the
beast
remarkably
similar
to
the
system
used
in
new
porsches
to
pressurize
the
oil
system
before
the
car
is
started
the
cage
however
uses
an
electric
oil
pump
wimps
despite
this
fix
the
engine
had
a
nasty
propensity
for
explosively
firing
its
valves
into
the
pistons
when
a
cylinder
would
temporarily
lose
a
bit
of
oil
pressure
in
a
corner
the
solution
was
to
run
even
higher
oil
pressures
and
change
the
gaskets
and
seals
regularly
this
was
feasible
because
it
was
a
racing
engine
with
just
a
single
overhead
lobe
and
no
pushrodshaftchain
towers
because
of
the
hydraulic
system
the
head
of
the
engine
came
to
an
almost
perfect
point

note
that
the
tip
was
not
truly
vertical
it
was
at
about
a
degree
angle
to
the
ground
and
this
drawing
doesnt
show
the
curvature
because
there
was
none
in
the

itself
the

curve
would
start
about
where

disappears
in
this

the
effect
of
the
pointy
heads
on
top
of
a
pair
of
gently
pundits
of
the
day
even
said
sensuously
curved
cylinders
was
much
like
a
pair
of
finned
viking
horns
poking
out
from
beneath
the
gas
tank
thus
the
name
the
vik
was
a
moderately
successful
racer
lightning
fast
when
it
worked
but
plagued
by
problems
relating
to
its
revolutionary
technology
eventually
it
was
dumped
when
spag
finally
realized
that
racing
was
not
where
the
spagthorpe
name
would
be
made
the
machines
were
raced
for
another
year
or
two
by
privateers
and
their
fate
approximately
six
vikings
were
made
plus
one
or
possibly
two
springers
confusing
the
issue
is
one
old
spag
staffer
who
swears
up
and
down
that
this
machine
was
tooled
for
production
and
that
as
many
as
twenty
or
thirty
machines
may
have
come
off
the
line
however
no
modern
record
of
a
production

survived

for

you
can
get
a

is
anywhere
from
to
thick

cable
looks
like
steel

shielded
in
a
flexible

finish
and
has
a
barreltype
locking
mechanism
i
dont
know
if
its
adjustable
but
my
source
says
its
more
difficult
to
pick
than
most
locks
and
the
cable
tends
to
squish
flat
in
boltcutter

rather
than

model
fyi
ill
be
getting
a
krypto
cable
next
paycheck
a
word
of
warning
though
kryptonite
also
sells
almost
useless
cable
locks
under
the
kryptonite
name
when
i
obtained
my
second
motorcycle
i
migrated
one
of
my
kryptonite
ulocks
from
my
bicycle
to
the
new
bike
i
then
went
out
shopping
for
a
new
lock
for
the
bicycle
for
about
the
same
money
i
had
the
choice
of
a
kryptonite
cable
lock
advantages
lock
front
and
back
wheels
on
bicycle
and
keep
them
both
kryptonite
name
or
a
cheesy
noname
ulock
advantages
real
steel
i
chose
the
kryptonite
cable
after
less
than
a
week
i
took
it
back
in
disgust
and
exchanged
it
for
the
cheesy
noname
ulock
first
the
krypto
cable
i
bought
is
not
made
by
kryptonite
is
not
covered
by
the
kryptonite
guarantee
and
doesnt
even
approach
kryptonite
standards
of
quality
and
quality
assurance
it
is
just
some
generic
madeintaiwan
cable
lock
with
the
kryptonite
name
on
it
secondly
the
latch
engagement
mechanism
is
something
of
a
joke
i
dont
know
if
mine
was
a
particularly
poor
example
but
it
was
often
quite
frustrating
to
get
the
latch
to
positively
engage
and
sometimes
it
would
seem
to
engage
only
to
fall
open
when
i
went
to
unlock
it
thirdly
the
lock
has
a
little
plastic
door
on
the
keyway
which
serves
the
sole
purpose
of
frustrating
any
attempt
to
insert
the
key
in
the
dark
i
didnt
try
it
obviously
but
i
have
my
doubts
that
the
lock
mechanism
would
stand
up
to
an
insert
screwdriver
and
torque
attack
fourthly
the
cable
was
not
in
my
opinion
of
sufficient
thickness
to
deter
theft
for
my
piece
of
crap
bicycle
that
is
all
cables
suffer
the
weakness
that
they
can
be
cut
a
few
strands
at
a
time
if
you
are
patient
you
can
cut
cables
with
fingernail
clippers
aviation
snips
would
go
through
the
cable
in
well
under
a
minute

stuff
your

hey

you
brought

i
agree
completely
driving
drunk
is
really
stupid
and
i
understand
and
appreciate
that
you
feel
bad
about
it
but
dwi
is
endemic
in
our
society
it
is
a
real
problem
and
we
as
motorcyclists
can
be
in
the
worst
of
vulnerable
positions
around
a
drunk
driver
alert
readers
might
remember
that
last
year
i
witnessed
a
dwi
accident
right
bloody
in
front
of
me
and
was
unable
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
the
participants
as
i
reported
here
also
drunk
driving
by
motorcyclists
is
a
prime
cause
of
their
injury
and
death
which
raises
the
insurance
rates
forces
stupidly
restrictive
laws
and
turns
the
public
against
those
of
us
who
ride
responsibly
in
my
view
drunk
driving
should
carry
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offenses
which
is
not
a
public
funds
issue
but
a
genuine
safety
issue
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admitting
having
been
caught
dwi
and
looking
for

over
the
consequences
dont

am
i
confusing
two
threads
here
three
actually
i
believe
i
discussed
countersteering
a
horse
before
basically
there
are
two
ways
to
steer
a
horse
plowrein
and
neckrein
plowreining
steers
him
by
keeping
the
reins
separate
and
you
pull

steers
a

by
holding
the
reins
together
in

hand
and
pulling
against
the
horses
neck
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
go
when
training
a
plowsteering
horse
to
neckrein
one
technique
is
to
cross
the
reins
under
his
necks
thus
when
neckreining
to
the
left
the
right
rein
pulls
against
the
right
side
of
the
neck

the

is

request
for
opinions
which
is
better
a
onepiece
aerostitch
or
a
twopiece
aerostitch
were
looking
for
more
than
well
the
is
more
versatile
but
the
is
better
protection
thanks
in
advance
nadine
what
is
best
books
have
been
written
on
that
but
in
regard
to
aerostich
it
really
depends
on
your
particular
size
shape
and
needs
if
you
upper
and
lower
body
are
not
proportional
according
to
aero
dimensions
then
it
probably
is
going
to
be
better
mixing
and
matching
the
piece
suit
i
have
the
piece
suit
and
i
am
very
happy
with
it
having
my
life
quota
of
scars
from
crashing
off
road
i
am
very
concerned
with
good
protection
and
i
believe
that
the
difference
in
protection
between
the
and
piece
suits
is
almost
negligible
i
think
the
optional
hip
pads
and
back
protector
make
much
more
of
a
difference
one
thing
that
is
nice
about
the
piece
is
if
you
go
somewhere
and
then
want
to
walk
around
for
a
while
still
with
jacket
you
can
just
detach
and
stow
the
pants
one
thing
to
note
is
that
goldfine
has
problems
getting
a
good
fit
for
many
women
with
standard
suits
supposedly
for
smaller
women
and
petite
men
for
that
matter
the
piece
will
fit
better
another
recommendation
is
to
pay
for
mods
if
you
need
them
i
wish
i
got
inches
added
to
my
pant
legs
i
find
the
long
suits
are
not
really
that
long
i
cant
imagine
how
short

standard

secondly
it
is
the
adhesion
of

the

dictate

if
you
have
no

what
it
is
through
trial
and

but
it
is
not
very
effective
methodology
only
by
understanding
the
technique
of
steering
a
motorcycle
can
one
improve
on
that
technique
i
hold
that
this
applies
to
any
human
endeavor
thats
all
it
is
an
interesting
bit
of
knowledge
and
to
claim
that
it
is
essential
for
all
bikers
to
know
it
or
that
you
can
corner
faster
or
better
as
a
result
is
absurd
do
you
consider
an
understanding
of
the
physics
of
traction
absurd
are
you
seriously
suggesting
that
one
can
form
a
traction
management
policy
without
understanding
what
it
is
or
what
factors
increase
or
decrease
available
traction
braking
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
any
biker
is
going
to
develop
his
maximum
swerving
ability
without
any
knowledge
of
turning
techniques
for
most
of
his
riding
life
this
may
not
be
a
problem
but
in
an
emergency
situation
it
is
very
definately
placing
him
at
a
disadvantage
but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for
them
to
learn
i
disagree
the
existance
and
immense
success
of
riding
courses
which
teach
the
technique
indicate
that
the
concept
can
be
taught
in
a
manner
that
is
neither
confusing
nor
detracts
from
any
other
aspects
of
the
course
and
that
was
my
original
point
perhaps
but
in
the
ensuing
discussion
you
strayed
far
from
that
point
to
claim
that
knowledge
of
steering
technique
is
irrelevant
to
a
riders
ability

apr

ryancousineaucompdynquestororg
ryan
cousineau
said
cb
dont
be
so
stupid
as
to
leave
your

on
the

where
it
can
cb
fall
down
and
go
boom
ryan
another
good
place
for
your
helmet
is
your
mirror
i
kid
you
not
this
is
very
bad
advice
helmets
have
two
major
impact
absorbing
layers
a
hard
outer
shell
and
a
closedcell
foam
impact
layer
most
helmets
lose
their
protective
properties
because
the
inner
liner
compacts
over
time
long
before
the
outer
shell
is
damaged
or
delaminates
from
age
dr
hurt
tested
helmets
for
many
years
following
his
landmark
study
and
has
estimated
that
a
helmet
can
lose
up
to
of
its
effectiveness
from
inner
liner
compression
i
have
a
video
he
produced
that
discusses
this
phenomenon
in
detail
puncture
compression
of
the
type
caused
by
mirrors
sissy
bars
and
other
relatively
sharp
objects
is
the
worst
offender
even
when
the
comfort
liner
is
unaffected
dents
and
holes
in
the
foam
can
seriously
degrade
the
effectiveness
of
a
helmet
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
parking
your
lid
on
the
mirrors
i
suggest
you
look
under
the
comfort
liner
at
the
condition
of
the
foam
if
it
is
significantly
damaged
or
missing
replace
the
helmet

in
article
blaisecsrhpcom

cirelli
writes
so
the
question
i
have
is
how
dangerous
is
riding
tough
question
more
dangerous
than
driving
a
car
and
far
more
dangerous
if
you
dont
apply
a
modicum
of
intelligence
to
the
activity
basically
stupidity
will
get
you
hurtkilled
a
lot
faster
on
a
motorcycle
than
in
a
car
but
with
care
it
is
not
unreasonably
dangerous
also
buying
good
protective
clothing
is
helpful
that
way
if
something
does
go
wrong
you
are
likely
to
be
less
severely
injured
first
thing
if
possible
take
a
msf
driver
training
course
this
will
get
you
started
on
the
right
foot
they
teach
control
of
the
vehicle
and
safe
riding
practices
second
buy
protective
gear
at
minimum
a
good
helmet
and
a
pair
of
leather
gloves
are
a
must
a
good
sturdy
piece
of
footgear
is
also
very
helpful
though
leather
hiking
boots
a
pair
of
old
army
boots
or
something
similar
works
fine
for
this
purpose
as
long
as
you
make
sure
the
laces
stay
tied
after
those
a
leather
jacket
and
leather
pants
or
chaps
are
nice
as
well
but
these
are
also
expensive
items
for
the
pants
many
people
consider
a
good
pair
of
jeans
to
be
reasonable
preferably
recent
and
of
a
fairly
heavy
weight
similarly
for
a
jacket
a
good
jean
jacket
is
a
reasonable
compromise
though
more
people
tend
to
have
leather
jackets
around
than
pants
another
thing
to
do
is
drop
in
on
garage
sales
looking
for
a
secondhand
leather
jacket
look
for
a
fairly
thick
leather
in
these
items
third
dont
do
anything
stupid
dont
ride
after
drinking
even
one
drink
can
noticeably
affect
you
judgement
and
balance
dont
ride
in
the
snow
or
when
conditions
are
such
that
black
ice
is
likely
be
very
careful
riding
in
the
rain
slow
way
down
take
corners
gingerly
brake
early
and
gently
try
not
to
ride
if
you
are
sick
tired
taking
any
medication
with
drowsiness
warnings
or
otherwise
not
in
average
shape
with
care
you
should
be
ok
the
next
question
i
have
is
what
bike
would
you
recommend
for
a
first
time
rider
i
dont
want
to
race
nor
do
i
want
to
ride
cross
country
nor
do
i
want
to
ride
on
dirt
trails
ill
probably
drive
it
on
back
roads
with
occasional
rides
on
city
streets
and
freeways
the
maximum
i
can
spend
is
about
so
ill
be
looking
at
a
used
bike
i
would
suggest
mid
to
late
japanese
midsized
standard
something
in
cc
range
would
probably
be
reasonable
if
you
are
shorterlighter
than
average
you
might
want
to
go
as
low
as
a
cc
bike
possible
models
the
suzuki
gs
series
eg
etc
these
are
generally
inline
bikes
generally
dependable
except
for
a
tendency
to
weakness
in
the
charging
system
stator
andor
regulatorrectifier
problems
my
first
bike
was
a
about
it
server
me
well
the
honda
nighthawk
series
this
may
also
be
known
as
the
cb
series
i
think
eg
honda
etc
this
is
another
series
of
standard
motorcycles
also
fairly
dependable
kawasaki
and
yamaha
probably
have
similar
bikes
but
i
dont
know
them
as
well
for
mid
to
late
models
of
the
above
you
should
be
able
to
buy
the
bike
for
under
leaving
you
money
for
protective
clothing
and
insurance
and
licensing
costs
hope
this
helps

go

it
cleared

became
warm

the

died
about

i

down

they
had

surrounded
by

not

what
else
are

traditional

go

or
i

youll
likely
not
notice
her
weight
too
much
a
piece
of
advice
for
you
dont
be
abrupt
with

throttle
no
wheelies
accelerate
a
wee
bit
more
slowly
than
usual
consciously
worry
about
spitting
her
off

its
as
much
your
job
to
keep
her
on

as
it
is
hers
and
i
guarantee
shell
be
put
off
by
the

ripping
out
from
under

whack

keep
the

she

your

is

the

you
need

shit
dont
crash
now

you

at

while
leaned
over
you
can
work
up

very

very
painful
depending

in

the
and
versions
had
a

imo
the

suffers
from
the

i
have
so

avoided
forking

nearly
weekly
this
in

is

bad

battery
access
is
gained
only

removing

my

lasted

i

i

what

i
can

i

at

turns

her
in

it

you

jerk
we
dont
wanna
hear
your
whining
fine
fuck
off
too
if
you
noticed
it
was
in
more
than
two
years
ago
and
yes
ive
learned
and
its
cost
me
and
yes
ive
known
people
friends
and
relatives
whove
been
involved
in
drunkrelated
accidents
not
them
they
were
hit
and
my
cousin
is
still
recovering
no
i
cant
take
back
what
happened
yes
it
was
stupid
but
by
reminding
me
about
it
all
the
time
youre
neither
helping
me
or
yourself
so
stuff
your
opinion
hey
man
you
brought
it
up
i
agree
completely
driving
drunk
is
really
stupid
and
i
understand
and
appreciate
that
you
feel
bad
about
it
but
dwi
is
endemic
in
our
society
it
is
a
real
problem
and
we
as
motorcyclists
can
be
in
the
worst
of
vulnerable
positions
around
a
drunk
driver
alert
readers
might
remember
that
last
year
i
witnessed
a
dwi
accident
right
bloody
in
front
of
me
and
was
unable
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
the
participants
as
i
reported
here
also
drunk
driving
by
motorcyclists
is
a
prime
cause
of
their
injury
and
death
which
raises
the
insurance
rates
forces
stupidly
restrictive
laws
and
turns
the
public
against
those
of
us
who
ride
responsibly
in
my
view
drunk
driving
should
carry
a
mandatory
prison
sentence
it
is
one
of
the
traffic
offenses
which
is
not
a
public
funds
issue
but
a
genuine
safety
issue
so
if
you
bring
up
the
subject
on
recmoto
admitting
having
been
caught
dwi
and
looking
for
sympathy
over
the
consequences
dont
expect
people
to
respond
with
warm
wishes

he

his

obviously
valid
because
he

did

in

past
with
that
said
im
guilty
of
the

type
of
hostility
towards

i
think
it

i
feel
the

not
severe
enough
the

may
be
true

that

case
then
it

gubment
we
need

if
we
had

then
fewer
people
would
do
it

my
fzrs
black
exhaust
pipes
are
rusty
and
i
researched
getting
them
repaired
yesterday
i
bought
a
can
of
vht
degree
black
header
paint
and
spent
an
hour
sanding
two
of
the
header
pipes
by
hand
sprayed
on

thought
about
how
clean
i
was
able
to
get
the
metal
with
sanding
and
determined
that
i
wouldnt
be
at
all
suprised
if
the
paint
worechipped
off
in
a
month
soooo
call
a
couple
of
places
up
in
minneapolis
and
discover
that
powder
coating
while
extremely
durable
will
not
handle
over
degree
temperatures
the
place
i
talked
to
said
they
were
experimenting
with
some
new
powder
that
is
supposed
to
handle
degrees
but
that
it
wouldnt
be
available
for
months
at
least
they
directed
me
to
another
shop
that
specializes
in
header
coating
the
other
shop
said
they
have
coatings
available
one
is
aluminized
that
can
do
degrees
and
is
comparable
to
powder
coating
for
durability
the
other
is
silicon
i
think
based
and
can
do
degrees
but
is
thinner
and
not
as
durable
both
coatings
have
a
textured
finish
not
super
smooth
and
should
be
cleaned

hot
water

should

more
foolish
my

used

track
extremely
true
going

i
would
set

screw
up
enough
to
hold

steady
slide

lean

the

would

it
wouldnt

it

you
can
turn
a
bike
without
countersteering
at

not
in
terms
of
the
input
to
the
bar
normally
associated
with
countersteering
as
ive

i
know
many
people
who

all
you
do
is
lean

any

theyre
giving
to
the

is
totally
unconscious

that
may
be
sufficient
to
get
you
down

for
years

is

rough
for

great
on
the
long
road
and
backroad
a
good
start
at
a
stable
but
i
dont
think
its
going
to
work
unfortunately
insurance
is
going
to
pluck
me
by
the
short
hairs
unless
some
insurance
agent
offers
a
multivehicle
discount
they
do

time

the

does

simple
fact
to

doesnt

be

the

can

the

firsttime
riders
are
surprised
by
how
tightly
you
can
turn
turn
dynamics
sit
so
that
you
feel

not
your

if
youre
confused
close
your
eyes
for
a
couple
of
turns
to
get
the
feel
of
it
or
just
hug
me
tight
please
no
sudden
moves
shift
your
weight
as
desired
but
be
gradual
so
i
can
compensate
your

as

trust
is
essential
trust
the
driver
me
to
do
the
right
thing
ive
driven
many
miles
on
this
thing
and
know
how
to
operate
it
enjoy
the
ride
this
is
important
to
stress
for
example
one
of
my
firsttime
passwngers
seemed
to
watch
the
speedo
like
a
hawk
i
drove
her
to
the
beach
down
and
whever
we
topped
mph
shed
holler
slow
down
im
scared
i
humored
her
for
a
while
then
simply
covered
the
speedometer
with
the
spare
piece
of
duct
tape
i
keep
stuck
to
the
top
of
the
cluster
problem
solved
she
watched
the
scenery
instead
of
the
instruments
and
had
a
much
better
time
based
on
her
experience
driving
a
lincoln
continental
she
was
unwilling
to
trust
my
ability
to
choose
a
safe
speed
for
the
bike
usually
ill
point
out
the
controls
engine
transmission
brakes
tires
etc
and
discuss
motorcycle
physics
a
bit
too
for
firsttimers
helps
calm
their
nerves
and
gives
the
bike
a
chance
to
warm
up
watch
out
for
gravel
on
the
mt
hamilton
road
there
were
lots
of
little
mudslides
after
the
last
big
rain
by
now
many
of
the
blind
corners
will
be
nicely
covered
with
a
carpet
of
little
round
nearly
invisible
stones
it
doesnt
help
build

you

yes
even
when

you
do
something
quite

to
countersteering
basically
to
turn

you
to
a
quick
wiggle
of
the

to
the

causing
a

lean

this
sounds
suspiciously

that
the

i

cable
ii
long
something
like
that
that
by

standards
seemed

a
decent
piece

i
used

in

the

seems

i
would

the

seems
to
be
a
much
better
unit
ive
got
the
larger
cable
about
inch
in
diameter
actually
i
think
its
larger
about
feet
long
which
coils

a

inch
coil

it

for

me
anyway
that
it

it
doesnt

that
the

i
was
a

on
many
bikes
for
the

time
before
i
started
riding
myelf
and
i
grew
to
hate
long
rides
on
sport
bikes
the
passenger
seats
are
not
designed
for
long
rides
the
passenger
positions
arent
even
usually
designed
for
short
rides
i
ended
up
torturing
my
knees
and
my
back
by
taking
long
rides
as
a
passenger
on
sport
bikes
one
of
the
reasons
i
originally
liked
my
current
guythingy
so
much
was
becase
he
had
a
bmw
id
suggest
a
shorter
extended
ride
at
first
a
short
turn
in
the
mountains
or
some
such
then
see
how
much
pain
shes
in
and
proceed
from
there
the
best
advice
id
give
a
beginning
passenger
dont
get
on
the
bike
until
the
rider
says
its
ok
and
work
out
some
sort
signal
for
the
rider
to
tell
you
when
its
ok
to
get
off
after
i
get
on
the
bike
i
squeeze
my
riders
hips
to
tell
that
im
ready
and
at
the
stop
he
nods
his
head
to
show
its
ok
for
me
to
get
off
keep
your
feet
on
the
pegs
at
all
times
dont
wiggle
unless
your
rider
asks
you
to
the
best
passengers
are
those
which
are
unobtrusive
echo
the
movements
and
lean
of
your
rider
look
over
the
shoulder
thats
most
comfortable
but
during
turns
look
over
the
shoulder
on
the
inside
of
the
turn
get
used
to
your
riders
shifting
style
riders
use
a
reasonably
consistent
shifting
style
avoid
helmet
bonk
helmet
bonk
is
when
your
rider
revs
the
bike
up
and
then
shifts
and
the
sudden
change
in
foreward
acceleration
causes
your
helmet
to
bonk
hishers
it
gets
old
real
fast
when
pulling
to
a
stop
put
a
hand
or
both
hands
on
the
tank
to
keep
your
weight
from
pushing
your
rider
up
onto
the
tank
putting
your
hands
on
the
tank
is
also
a
good
way
to
stretch
your
back
if
youre
in
pain
but
im
told
it
gets
harder
to
steer
in
turns
if
you
leave
them
there
switch
your
hands
to
the
guardrail
to
stretch
your
shoulders
but
be
sure
and
squeeze
your
thighs
while
youre
doing
it
so
your
rider
knows
youre
still
there
the
guard
rail
isnt
as
safe
as
holding
onto
your
rider
dont
be
afraid
to
ask
for
frequent
stops
if
youre
in
pain
or
losing
feeling
in
your
feet
passenger
seats
are
not
generally
designed
for
comfort
work
out
some
sort
of
pull
over
signal
beforehand

all

the
fact
is
that
when
you
are

a
dog
is
arrowing
to
intercept
it
may
be
unwise
for
you
to
stop

try

deal
with
the
dog
for
the
simple
fact
that
it
might
be
through
your
leathers

working
on
your
jeans
before
you
can
dismount
and
deal
with
it
properly
by
all
means
if
you
do
kick
the
dog
or
otherwise
get
its
attention
stop
and
stay
there
if
you
kick
the
dog
and
ride
away
that
is
a
victory
for
the

it
drove
you
out

it
is
not

it
is

if

oh

serious
and
back
off
now
you
have
established
your

over

and
it
probably
will

again
llamas
however
are

if

never
needs
valve
adjustments
i
bought
a
yamaha
with
miles
over
the
last
years
ive
put
of
commute
miles
onnit
valve
adjustment
intervals
are
suppossed
to
be
every
well
every
or
so
ive
checked
the
pad
clearences
and
they
never
change
if
anything
the
clearances
seem
to
be
getting
a
little
smaller
which
makes
no
sense
to
me
with
the
pad
system
the
pads
should
wear
until
the
clearances
are
too
great
right
i
know
that
threaded
adjusters
can
tighten
up
but
i
didnt
think
these
kind
could
bottom
lines
is
that
i
havent
touched
my
valves
for
on
this
bike
and
they
are
still
nice
and
quiet
and
if
anything
the
clearances
are
tighter
whats
the
deal
any
other
yam
triple

notice
extremely
long

im
more
interested
in

without
a
massive
amount
of

and
one
which
has
been
well
maintained
as
i
intend
to
keep

well

for

my
best
advice
would
be
to
contact
a
local
dealer
see
the
yellow
pages
under
motorcycle
dealers
and
ask
for
the
address
of
the
local
section
bmw

the
local
bmw
dealer
will
give
you
details
of
the
bmw
insurance
terms
and
the
club
will
help
you
with
all
details
getting
a
bike
from
the
dealer
is
the
best
bet
if
you
can
afford
it

more

driving

be

car
in

so
i
purchased
the
charger
believe
it

the
thing
worked
the

held
a
charge
and
energetically
started
the
car
many
times
after

weeks
of
just
sitting
eventually
i
had
to
purchase
a
new
battery
anyway
because
the
winter
sun
wasnt
strong
enough
due
to
its
low
angle
i
think
i
paid
or
for
the
charger
there
are
more
powerful
more
expensive
ones
but
i
purchased
the
cheapest
one
i
could
find
ive
never
used
it
on
the
bike
because
i
have
an
ez
charger
on
it
and
keep
it
plugged

you

go
when
training
a

horse
to

one
technique
is
to
cross
the
reins
under
his
necks
thus
when
neckreining
to
the
left
the
right
rein
pulls
against
the
right
side
of
the
neck
but
the
left
side
of
the
bit
which
the
horse
is
used
to
from
his
plowreining
days
i
learned
when
riding
bareback
as
a

to
palmreign
by
just
pushing
on
the
right
side
of
the
horses
neck
with
your

turn

like
countersteering

that
came

me

deform

creating

bank
ice

alter
the
phase
of
the
ice
and
also
carve
out
their
own
tracks
so
what
so
they
have
bugger
all
to
do
with
motorcycles
hence
any
apparent
similarity
in
handling
characteristics
may
or
may
not
be
analagous
in
its
underlying
physics
to
that
behind
motorcycle
handling
characteristics
ok
as
one
last
attempt
ill
take
a
different
tack
we
all
seem
to
be
in
agreement
that
there
are
two
explanations
for
why
one
can
use
the
handlebars
to
lean
a
moving
motorcycle
the
question
is
is
one
of
the
effect
dominant
and
which
one
is
it
the
idea
would
be
to
design
an
experiment
which
would
seaprate
the
two
characteristics
and
see
which
effect
produces
a
similar
result
to
the
one
with
which
those
of
us
who
have
bikes
are
familiar
lets
look
at
the
one
that
so
far
has
sparked
no
controversy
on
its
own
gyroscopic
precession
to
examine
this
alone
we
would
have
to
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
effect
by
not
allowing
the
contact
patches
to
transmit
any
force
the
wheels
and
steering
mechanism
would
have
to
remain
and
be
attached
to
a
vehicle
with
about
the
same
weight
as
a
bike
through
suspension
so
that
the
wheels
transmit
forces
to
the
bike
the
same
way
similar
to
a
bikes
an
experiment
would
be
to
ride
a
bike
along
a
dry
road
to
get
moving
and
to
get
the
wheels
spinning
then
change
surfaces
to
something
that
wont
transmit
forces
through
the
contact
patches
and
try
a
steering
manoeuvre
to
see
if
the
bike
leans
it
probably
would
since
some
of
us
know
how
easy
it
is
to
fall
down
on
ice
but
we
wouldnt
get
a
good
idea
of
how
well
or
what
it
feels
like
because
without
the
contact
patches
we
cant
turn
maybe
theres
a
better
way
besides
even
ice
doesnt
get
rid
of
the
contact
patch
forces
altogether
so
wed
have
to
find
a
really
frictionless
surface
youd
have
to
try
it
again
with
the
wheels
locked
to
really
know
if
it
was
the
rotation
that
did
it
looking
at
the
contactpatch
effect
only
however
is
fairly
simple
now
we
have
to
find
a
vehicle
that
gets
the
about
the
same
magnitude
and
direction
of
cantact
patch
forces
as
a
motorcycle
and
transmits
them
about
the
same
way
to
the
vehicle
but
without
rotating
wheels
how
it
gets
the
contact
patch
forces
is
irrelevant
were
just
looking
for
something
that
has
contact
patches
that
can
go
straight
and
not
sideways
and
skis
or
skates
would
do
fine
i
dont
know
of
any
snowski
or
skate
bikes
but
up
here
we
have
the
suzuki
wetbike
that
is
arranged
like
a
motorcycle
but
has
fat
water
skis
where
there
should
be
wheels
i
think
the
propellor
is
in
front
of
the
rear
ski
or
something
like
that
but
we
could
try
it
at
a
coast
to
get
rid
of
most
of
its
effect
now
i
admit
that
this
is
second
hand
info
although
id
love
to
try
one
of
these
but
the
review
in
the
local
cycle
rag
and
a
guy
in
a
bike
shop
that
sells
them
both
say
that
this
machine
handles
very
much
like
a
motorcycle
in
that
you
countersteer
it
to
turn
so
we
have
contact
patches
that
transmit
similar
forces
to
a
bikes
a
similar
suspension
arrangement
and
no
gyroscopes
but
we
do
have
countersteering
conclusion
you
dont
need
gyroscopes
to
countersteer
vehicles
that
have
motorcyclelike
contact
patch
arrangements
we
still
dont
know
what
real
effect
the
gyroscopes
have
when
theyre
there
but
from
my
observations
of
how
handlebar
angle
force
etc
relate
to
steering
in
general
im
willing
to
bet
that
theyre
not
the
dominant
factor
in
countersteering
if
you
dont
like
this
conclusion
then
dont
accept
it
but
my
motorcycles
behaviour
is
consistent
with
it

someone
can
prove

at

i
calmly
put

walked

i

he
was

the
reason

did
i
do

well
i
used
to
get
mad

either
try

my
anger
to
jerks

to
uhm
educate

in
how
to

in

now
i
just
try

get
them
off
my

in
heavy
traffic
i
slow
down
a
bit
mostly
so
i
have
more
buffer
zone
in
front
to
balance
the
minimal
buffer
behind
but
i
also
often
find
that
the
jerk
behind
will
notice
traffic
moving
faster
in
other
lanes
switch
into
one
of
them
and
pass
me
which
is
fine
because
then
i
can
keep
a
better
eye
on
the
jerk
from
behind
while
looking
ahead
rather
than
from
in
front
while
splitting
my
attention
between
ahead
and
the
mirrors
in
traffic
so
heavy
that
there
is
no
way
for
the
jerk
to
pass
i
might
pull
over
as
if
to
look
for
a
street
number
or
name
still
ignoring
the
jerk
just
to
get
the
jerk
off
my
tail
if
this
all
sounds
well
wimpy
or
undenizenly
or
pessimistic
or
perhaps
for
any
psych
types
passiveaggressive
consider
that
i
prefer
to
get
my
adrenaline
jollies
from
riding
rather
than
from
yelling
at
jerks
a
ride
can
improve
my
whole
day
while
yelling
at
a
jerk
is
likely
for
me
to
ruin
my
ride
or
my
day
with
my
own
anger
in
the
worst
case
yelling
at
the
jerk
could
ruin
my
life
since
even
a
tiny
jerk
in
a
cage
behind
me
is
better
armed
with
the
cage
than
i
am
on
a
bike
on
the
other
hand
you
might
try
subtly
arranging
to
be
the
last
vehicle
to
legally
cross
one
or
more
intersections
leaving
the
jerk
waiting
for
cross
traffic
and
thus
off
your
tail
or
crossing
illegally
hopefully
in

of
the
waiting
police

almost
everything

and
not

heard
them

it

i

this
is
just
setting
myself
up
but
this
is
actually
one
of
the
things
that
is
really
good
about
bmw
bikes
from
all
accounts
ive
heard
practically
no
one
steals
bmws
probably
it
is
similar
for
moto
guzzis
and
other
relative
exotics
since
there
isnt
a
large
demand
for
parts
and
the
bike
would
be
much
easier
to
track
down
it
seems
that
the
most
stolen
bikes
are
harleys
and
jap
sport
bikes
well
id
say
youre
mostly
right
but
for
different
reasons
btw
as
of
a
couple
years
ago
the
most
stolen
bikes
in
orange
county
and
sf
were
gsxs
and
ninjas
probably
the
biggest
reason
bmws
arent
ripped
off
is
that
most
people
who
buy
bmws
will
only
deal
with
the
actual
bmw
dealer
or
mail
order
types
most
of
these
can
have
their
inventory
checked
fairly
easily
by
lawenforcement
types
and
their
markup
is
usually
sufficient
to
keep
them
honest
about
acquiring
parts
for
harleys
and
ricerockets
youve
got
different
situations
there
is
a
huge
aftermarket
in
harley
parts
so
a
bike
can
be
parted
out
fairly
easily
ditto
the
nonsport
japanese
bikes
but
the
prices
on
the
parts
for
these
are
not
as
high
comparatively
for
the
rockets
anytime
a
bike
goes
down
the
plastic
is
usually
cracked
and
is
expensive
to
replace
its
fairly
easy
then

there
by

instead
of

was

i
had
planned

two

for

giving
me
days
travel
time
on
either
side

this
looks

of
about

your

calc
is
correct
for
an
on

distance
and
not
as
the
crow

this
is
a
day
for
days
if
you
spend

would
be

total
waste

thats
at

hours
on

road
every
day
not

was

from

maybe
ottawa
to
austin

i
figured
if

wanna
do
a
trip
of
this
magnitude

enjoy
it
id
have
to
get
my
ass
off
the
major

spend
lots

enjoying
the
country
around
me

stopping

meeting

going

a
few
bars
no
sense
spending
weeks
looking
out
a
helmet
with
the
closest

at

need
at

weeks

check
the
vent
tube
to
the
tank
sometimes
the
tube
is
clogged
or
constricted
this
prevents
gas
from
flowing
into
the
carbs
because
of
the
vacuum
created
by
the
displacement
of
the
gasoline
this
is
the
small
tube
on
the
bottom
of
the
tank
the
large
tube
is
the
overflow
you
will
have
to
remove
the
left
side
tail
section
to
get
access
to
this
area
good
luck
but
if
it
was
clogged
wouldnt
this
interfere
with
engine
operation
all
the
time
when
it
runs
it
runs
well
good
point
did
not
catch
this
in
the
original
post
the
only
other
things
which
come
to
mind
since
this
is
a
gravity
feed
fuel
system
is
this
the
fuel
petcock
valve
is
vacuum
controlled
from
the
carburator
let
suppose
there
is
a
small
hole
or
bad
seal
either
in
the
hose
itself
or
the
vacuum
valve
in
the
fuel
petcock
when
it
is
cold
the
hole
is
open
enough
to
open
the
valve
just
enough
to
allow
gas
to
the
carbs
with
the
choke
on
since
the
choke
creates
more
low
pressure
in
the
carbs
when
on
to
draw
gas
and
as
the
engine
and
surrounding
area
warm
up
the
hole
seals
up
one
way
to
check
fuel
flow
through
the
valve
would
be
to
pull
the
side
panels
off
and
remove
the
fuel
hose
to
the
carbs
connect
a
tube
of
the
correct
size
preferably
clear
tubing
to
observe
fuel
flow
on
the
output
side
of
the
fuel
petcock
remove
the
control
hose
from
carburator
make
sure
the
tank
is
full
place
the
valve
in
the
on
position
and
apply
vacuum
to
the
control
hose
preferably
with
a
vacuum
device
with
a
gauge
to
check
for
air
leaks
with
vacuum
applied
fuel
should
flow
freely
to
see
if
there
is
a
vent
problem
do
this
with
the
fuel
filler
cap
open
and
closed
if
it
flows
a
lot
faster
with
the
filler
cap
open
then
there
may
be
something
in
the
vent
airway
which
changes
position
and
depending
on
the
position
may
clog
or
partially
clog
the
vent
i
have
heard
of
some
fuel
tanks
being
replaced
to
fix
this
problem
so
the
things
which
might
be
defective
are
the
control
hose
from
carb
the
petcock
valve
and
possibly
the
fuel
tank
vent
now
if

you

have
you
actually
every
used
your
secret
method
to
break
all
the
different
kinds
of
bike
locks
or
are
you
taking
someones
word
for
it
the
fact
is
it
is
unlikely
that
someone
reading
anything
here
is
going
to
go
into
a
successful
bikestealing
business
because
they
read
anything
in
recmotorcycles
so
please
tell
us
what
you
are
talking
about
we
cant
even
protect
against
an
assault
or
discuss
methods
if
you
dont
come
out
with
it
see
i
have
heard
the
ones
about
the
pipes
and
the
liquid
nitrogen
and
the
cordless
dremel
tools
and
a
bunch
of
other
ones
the
most
plausable
method
i
am
not
a
bike
thief
so
i
really
dont
know
for
certain
is
just
to
put
a
rod
through
each
wheel
and
use
four
guys
to
just
lift
the
bike
into
a
truck
this
works
because
most
people
dont
lock
their
bikes
to
anything
since
that
method
is
so
childishly
easy
i
figure
a
nice
visible
chain
or
cable
locking
the
bike
to
something
is
likely
to
make
a
lazy
thief
go
on
to
the
next
bike
hey
finally
an
advantage
to
the
weight
and
high
cg
of
the
concours
especially
since
i
have
a
bike
that
i
would
hate
to
see
ripped
off
by
such
a
trival
tactic
warning
no
lock
alone
is
a
safe
deterent
against
theft
the
thief
doesnt
need
to
be
a
locksmith
or
a
lockpicker
to
walk
away
with
your
property
i
personally
think
motion
alarms
in
combination
to
a
lock
of
this
type
is
the
way
to
go
if
in
fact
you
are
that
concerned
what
tactic
are
you
referring
to
if
we
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
we
cant
very
well
guard
against
it
can
we
for
my
money
literally
i
rely
on
a
combination
of
a
motiondetector
alarm
with
pager
when
im
out
of
earshot
of
the
bike
in
a
questionable
area
cc
insurance
and
i
try
to
park
in
obvious
visible
areas
with
lots
of
people
about
see
if
someone
just
plays
with
the
bike
without
intention
of
stealing
it
at
least
some
eyes
are
on
it
and
if
they
get
too
rambunctious
theyll
set
off
the
alarm
thats
for
a
nice
bike
for
a
ratbike
the
trick
is
to
always
keep
its
actual
value
well
below
bluebook
so
that
it
looks
so
crappy
nobody
would
want
to
steal
it
and
even
if
they
were
stupid
enough
to
you
would
make
a
profit
on
the
deal
seriously
if
i
for
instance
need
to
go
on
a
business
trip
for
a
week
and
sadly
have
to
leave
the
bikes
sitting
they
both
get
a
shittylooking
but
useable
cover
locked
on
and
both
bikes
locked
to
each
other
and
a
curb
bumper
in
the
parking
lot
under
the
light
i
usually
rig
the
cable
locks
i
use
aircraft
cable
so
that
if
anyone
pulls
on
either
bike
or
the
cable
joining
them
the
concours
alarm
goes
off
and
i
have
a
friend
come
buy
every
day
to
have
a
look
and
make
sure
theyre
still
there
the
only
thing
i
have
ever
had
stolen
was
a
cover
and
that
was
over
winter
storage
with
the
battery
out
of
the
bike
and
thus
no
alarm
oh
put
your
own
eyelets
into
the
cover
for
the
locks
to
pass
through
and
place
them
so
that
they
have
to
absolutely
destroy
the
cover
to
get
it
off
thats
the
best
that
i

understand

stop

far

can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
glad
to
hear
that
the
bozo
managed
to
stop
ive
only
been
riding
for
about
two
years
but
here
are
my
rules
for
traffic
light
survival
i
try
to
never
stop
just
over
a
hill
behind
a
car
if
i
have
to
stop
in
such
a
location
i
pull
almost
completely
next
to
the
car
in
front
of
me
if
im
the
only
one
ie
no
car
in
front
i
turn
the
bike
somewhat
sideways
across
the
lane
to
increase
my
visibility
to
any
oncoming
vehicle
make
sure
to
keep
your
taillight
visible
to
traffic
though
note
my
bike
is
bright
white
turning
sideways
on
a
black
bike
might
not
be
as
beneficial
on
a
flat
road
i
stop
with
a
bit
of
room
ahead
of
me
usually
about
two
or
three
bike
lengths
this
will
hopefully
give
me
room
to
pull
forward
and
to
the
side
as
a
car
approaches
if
you
are
the
last
in
a
line
of
vehicles
watch
your
mirrors
constantly
if
you
see
a
vehicle
approaching
and
cant
see
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
heshe
is
slowing
down
get
out
of
the
way
now
flicker
your
brake
light
if
im
the
last
vehicle
in
line
i
will
pull
and
release
the
brake
as
a
car
approaches
from
behind
noticed
the
car
by
watching
my
mirrors
of
course
i
vary
the
speed
of
the
flicker
hoping
to
make
the
cager
notice
that
theres
something
in
the
lane
ahead
of
him
now
with
all
that
said
its
the
situation
where
you
are
first
in
line
that
i
feel
most
defenseless
if
youre
first
in
line
your
forward
escape
route
is
seriously
limited
you
can
only
move
forward
to
the
extent
that
you
dont
enter
the
intersection
i
leave
some
room
behind
the
stop
line
although
around
here
the
light
activators
are
always
right
up
next
to
the
stop
line
and
watch
the
mirrors
i
think
ive
decided
that
hopping
off
the
bike
might
be
the
best
way
out
of
this
situation

other
ideas

one

my

if
your

protecting
the

in

have
him
or
her
fitted
for
a
helmet
that
is
their
size
if
your
primary
concern
is
complying
with
stupid
helmet
laws
carry
a
real
big
spare
you
can
put
a
big
or
small
head
in
a
big
helmet
but
not
in
a
small
one
while
shopping
for
a
passenger
helmet
i
noticed
that
in
many
cases
the
external
dimensions
of
the
helmets
were
the
same
from
s
through
xl
the
difference
was
the
amount
of
inside
padding
my
solution
was
to
buy
a
large
helmet
and
construct
a
removable
liner
from
a
sheet
of
closedcell
foam
and
some
satin
glued
to
the
inside
surface
the
result
is
a
reasonably
snug
fit
on
my

the
liner
in

a

what
do
i
do
with
old
gasoline
help
i
have
a
which
i
stopped
riding
about
years
ago
i
upgraded
to
an
sabre
i
parked
it
in
the
corner
of
my
parking
lot
and
planned
on
draining
the
gas
spraying
oil
in
the
tank
etc
to
get
it
ready
to
store
well
after
a
lot
of
procrastination
all
i
ended
up
doing
was
throwing
a
tarp
on
it
well
now
i
have
to
move
and
want
to
clean
up
the
i
tried
starting
it
with
someone
elses
battery
and
had
no
luck
my
first
guess
is
that
it
is
the
gas
and
so
i
plan
on
draining
it
and
replacing
it
with
new
gas
i
can
only
pray
that
i
didnt
trash
the
carbeurators
the
question
is
what
do
i
do
with
this
old
gas
i
am
not
going
to
run
it
in
my
sabre
and
i
think
that
there
is
enough
that
i
dont
want
to
burn
it
campus
police
dont
think
too
kindly
about
bonfires
dumping
it
isnt
a
great
idea
thanks
for
any
ideas

are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
my
experience
is
when
they
pound
their
fists
on
your
back
it
means
slow
down
seriously
concentrate
on
being
very
smooth
and
you
will
make
her
experience
much
more
enjoyable
even
a
normal
upshift
causes
your
passenger
to
bob
so
i
ease
off
the
throttle
before
pulling
in
the
clutch
to
eliminate
this
its
more
work
but
your
passenger
will
appreciate
it
also
ive
found
that
using
more
rear
brake
than
normal
helps
keep
the
bike
from
diving
as
much
during
routine
stops
which
makes
it
much
easier
for
the
passenger
to
hang
on
if
youre
going
sport
riding
have
the
passenger
reach
around
you
and
brace
themselves
against
the
tank
so
you
dont
have
to
bear
both
your
weights
with
your
arms
again
your
bike
will
dive
less
too

that

generally

more
points
than
four

words

and
introducing
a

polysyllabic

strabismic
for
example
is
likely
to
insure
that
some
small
part
of

will
become
immortal

the
serious
overreaction
ought
to
be
worth
a
couple
of
points
not
to
mention
the
bit
condemning
everthing
the
flamee
might
ever
say
the
non
sequitur
about
guns
and
helmets
is
just
the
proper
flourish
i
personally
am
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
two
types
of
good
flames
the
first
does
trade
quality
in
the
sense
you
mention
for
heat
this
has
a
certain
surprise
value
and
if
done
correctly
which
i
contend
was
done
above
is
reasonably
entertaining
while
it
is
true
that
the
flame
i
posted
does
not
mention
anyones
habitual
velocity
friends
dinner
or
entertainment
it
says
what
it
needs
to
with
the
appropriate
flair
and
it
is
short
the
weakness
of
this
type
of
flame
is
actually
that
it
can
easily
be
taken
too
far
at
which
point
it
becomes
trite
and
boring
witness
the
infante
thread
recently
the
other
type
of
flame
which
you
seem
to
be
glorifying
above
has
a
few
weaknesses
as
well
in
the
first
place
it
can
get
verbose
and
tedious
in
the
extreme
particularly
if
the
reader
does
not
already
strongly
identify
with
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
second
discussing
someones
personal
qualities
habits
and
so
forth
can
quickly
become
libelous
or
is
that
slanderous
i
can
never
remember
the
difference
this
leads
to
a
proliferation
of
lawyers
which
is
widely
regarded
as
a
bad
thing
finally
introducing
polysyllabic
words
is
problematic
i
cant
haul
my
big
dic
around
on
my
bike
and
it
would
be
bad
form
to
use
a
word
which
actually
turned
out
to
have
a
meaning
especially
one
which
ran
counter
to
my
use
and
flamage
in
general
in
summary
blaine
your
score
for
that
flame
is
incorrect
while
it
may
be
the
wunderflame
the
weaknesses
you
point
out
are
not
necessarily
weaknesses
and
your
suggested
corrections
are
not
always
useful
nor
applicable
you
also
probably
couldnt
outrun
a
tennis
ball
with
a
flatulent
dog
stapled
to
your
posterior
and
ill
bet
you
and
your
motorcycle
lean
to
the
outside
while
turning
the
same

anyone

he

oh
bull
pucky

they
use
dogs
because
a
many
people
are
scared
shitless
of
them
and
b
because
of
the
nose
and
the
vision
and
hearing
without
their
cop

the

is
so
much
meat

they
are
less
likely

would
kill

those
teeth
arent
very
much
good
with
an
arm
shoved
into
the
back
of
the
animals
throat
and
held
there
and
the
neck
is
not
ok
so
youve
disabled
the
dogs
mouth
and
given
up
use
of
your
arm
to
do
so
how
bout
them
front
and
read
paws
and
the
fact
that
to
plug
up
that
mouth
youve
given
the
dog
the
advantage
of
balance
espcially
strong
neither
are
the
leg
joints
which
can
be
easily
snapped
or
the
skull
easily
crushed
on
even
the
largest
dogs
have
you
ever
tried
to
snap
leg

crush
the
skull
of

without

not

youve

your

you

a

a

was
the
most

component

the
specific
skills
of
emergency
braking
cornering

swerving
must
be

practiced
as
well
but
more
significant
was
that
of
rider
did
nothing
confronted
with
a
potential
accident
and
another
third
collided
or
fell
over
as
a
result
of

error
the

less

than
early

re

a
few
random
thoughts
on
riding
with
a
passenger
theres
no
substitute
for
a
bike
with
sufficient
power
having
taken
passengers
very
occasionally
on
the
small
etc
bikes
i
used
to
ride
in
the
uk
it
was
hard
im
now
riding
a
and
thats
great
even
moving
from
my
freinds
i
was
riding
recently
this
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
neither
i
nor
my
regular
passengers
are
particularly
slimline
i
always
tell
passengers
stay
in
line
with
the
bike
on
corners
that
makes
their
movements
predictable
my
regular
passengers
both
tend
to
hold
either
the
rack
or
nothing
at
all
i
dont
really
like
having
a
passenger
hold
onto
me
except
for
short
periods
again
that
may
be
biased
by
the
fact
that
ive
had
a
couple
of
new
passengers
a
friend
recently
for
her
first
time
on
a
bike
who
hold
on
to
me
real
tight
making
any
kind
of
maneuvering
difficult
ive
also
discovered
that
on
longer
trips
i
prefer
a
passenger
who
moves
and
shifts
their
weight
a
bit
i
recently
took
a
work
collegue
to
a
meeting
about
a
hour
ride
and
he
sat
totally

very
easy
but
the
seat
fastening
hardware
was
apparently
always
on
the
wrong
sides
with
the
stock
seat
it
never
was
easy
to
put
on
once
i
figured
that
out
the
new
seat
went
on
the
first
try
the
passenger
backrest
though
does
not
fit
as
i
thought
it
might
the
supplied
screw
to
set
the
backrest
angle
does
not
fit
and
i
have
not
yet
found
a
suitable
hard
sae
grade
or
perhaps
bolt
that
fits
there
is
a
a
soft
bolt
in
there
now
just
dont
lean
back
the
drivers
section
of
the
seat
is
a
bit
wider
seems
comfortable
enough
but
then
again
i
put
about
miles
on
the
stock
seat
without
a
thought
the
passengers
section
has
about
times
the
volume
of
foam
that
the
stock
seat
has
and
from
my
short
test
it
seems
much
more
comfortable
the
backrest
helps
a
bit
but
ive
not
has
enough
time
to
really
test
it
the
backrest
also
comes
with
a
small
pocket
its
now
more
difficult
to
swing
my
leg
up
over
the
taller
seat
if
i
go
on
the
threenotch

soon

one
of

that

is
to

as
charles
said
many

are

will
panic
when
one
goes
on

they
will
then
turn
their

on
the
dog
and
this
allows
the
police

to
take
control
your
advice
is
correct

a
dog
is
still
no
match
for
a
trained
human
in
a
fight
a
single

a

in

should
really

the

is
no

re

hi
im
not
sure
what
the
other
guy
cant
track
down
his
post
for
his
name
was
talking
about
when
he
made
the
claim
that
cobralinks
are
not
adjustable
they
are
theres
a
space
between
each
link
where
the
teeth
of
the
locking
head
notch
in
thus
each
link
is
a
possible
locking
point
also
and
this
is
not
applicable
to
hardcore
thieves
who
cart
around
liquid
nitrogen
and
oxyacetylene
torches
the
cobralinks
look
a
lot
more
effective
than
kryptonite
cable
locks
imho
and
i
think
the
initial
appearance
effect
is
more
relevant
to
boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat
crackingunsecuredbike
deterrence
as
long
as
the
lock
is
nominally
functional
finally
i
notice
that
when
i
ride
with
my
leathers
harness
boots
and
the
cobralinks
slung
across
like
a
bandolier
btw
ive
crashed
in

rain
dressed
like
this
and
the
lock
didnt
pulverize
any
vertebrae
cagers
give
me
a
much
wider
berth
dont
hassle
me
and
tend
to
avoid
any
potentially
inflammatory
action

love

almost

i

come
to
know
that
humans
do

all

at

one
anyway
it
is
a
little
known
fact
that
a
dog
will
involuntarily
regurgitate
and
release
an
object
that
is
too
large
to
swallow
i
was
told
that
if
i
were
ever
attacked
by
a
dog
i
should
ball
my
hand
in
a
fist
and
force
it
down
the
dogs
throat
the
dog
would
naturally
gag
and
release
and
become
momentarily
disoriented
this
commonly
happens
to
humans
when
we
go
to
a
doctor
and
have
our
throats
examined
proof
positive
in
the
time
during

dogs
disorientation
the
next
move
would
be
to
wrap
an
arm
about
the
dog
throat
in
a
choke
hold
manner

constrict
with

honey
and
i
can
go
pretty

anyplace
id
take
my
mountain
bike
as

as
shaft
effect
its
more
a

effect
from

in

opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a

maybe
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
buffeting
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequence
okay
here
are
my
questions
any
recommendations
for
a
homemade
fairing
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhaps
my

for
comfort

dont

anybody
have

it
myself
out

plexiglas
i
run
two
lights
the
standard
headlamp
plus
a
sidelamp
mounted
on
the
crash
bar
the
illuminations
excellent
that
way
with
a
full
beam
coming
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumination
from
left
to
right
and
it
really
picks
up
the
periphery
deer
lurking
etc
combined
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
alternators
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
puttering
around
in

at
low
rpm
this
is
embarassing
im
having

starting

first
thing
in

morning
i
invariably
flood
the
carbs
then
go
in

read

then
she
starts
right
up
is
this
a

the

to

my

to
fend

attacks
one
of
my
brothers
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
practicing
bizzare
tricks
on
his
megabuckmicromass
bike
he
said
he
once
repelled
a
dog
attack
by
picking
up
the
rear
of
the
bike
and
smacking
the
dog
in
the
side
of
the
head
with
the
rear
wheel
the
dog
had
no
idea
what
hit
him
and
he
fled
quite
rapidly
then
again
he
could
jump
garbage
cans
without
a
ramp
so
i
dont
think
id
care
to
try
this
one
on
a

the
telephone
worked
much
better
than
the
tire
pump

the

nope

around
here
guns
helmets
are
the
wallpaper
i
personally
am
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
two
types
of
good
flames
the
first
does
trade
quality
in
the
sense
you
mention
for
heat
this
has
a
certain
surprise
value
and
if
done
correctly
which
i
contend
was
done
above
is
reasonably
entertaining
not
everyone
in
recmotoland
is
so
easily
amused
blaine
as
an
elder
has
seen
the
superflamers
at
their
peaks
or
depths
if
you
prefer
with
that
sort
of
incendiary
backdrop
awarding
your
faltering
bic
a
was
the
purest
act
of
charity
while
it
is
true
that
the
flame
i
posted
does
not
mention
anyones
habitual
velocity
friends
dinner
or
entertainment
it
says
what
it
needs
to
with
the
appropriate
flair
and
it
is
short
the
weakness
of
this
type
of
flame
is
actually
that
it
can
easily
be
taken
too
far
at
which
point
it
becomes
trite
and
boring
unless
of
course
your
audience
has
only
seen
several
thousand
similarly
uninspiring
attempts
in
this
arena
in
that
case
the
trite
boring
threshold
tends
to
drift
away
from
where
you
first
set
it
as
yours
will
eventually
or
not
the
other
type
of
flame
which
you
seem
to
be
glorifying
above
blah
blah
blah
in
summary
blaine
your
score
for
that
flame
is
incorrect
while
it
may
be
the
wunderflame
the
weaknesses
you
point
out
are
not
necessarily
weaknesses
and
your
suggested
corrections
are
not
always
useful
nor
applicable
until
you
can

the

you

short

been

not
true
the

is
well

i

i
eagerly
await

the
ice
princess
next
door
makes
a
habit
of
flooring
her
cage
out
of
the
driveway
when
she
sees
me
coming
probably
only
hits
or
so
i
made
the
mistake
of
waving
to
a
neighbor
she
has
some
sort
of
grudge
now
i
was
riding
downhill
at
on
a
local
backroad
when
a
brown
dobie
came
flashing
through
the
brush
at
well
over
on
an
intercept
course
with
my
front
wheel
the
dog
had
started
out
at
the
top
of
the
hill
when
it
heard
me
and
still
had
a
lead
when
it
hit
the
road
the
dog
was
approaching
from
my
left
and
was
running
full
tilt
to
get
to
my
bike
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
before
i
went
by
rover
was
looking
back
at
me
to
calculate
the
final
trajectory
too
bad
it
didnt
notice
the
car
approaching
at
from
the
other
direction
i
got
a
closeup
view
of
the
our
poor
canine
friends
noggin
careening
off
the
front
bumper
smacking
the
asphalt
and
getting
runover
by
the
front
tire
it
managed
a
pretty
good
yelp
just
before
impact
peripheral
imminent
doom
i
guess
the
driver
didnt
see
me
or
they
probably
would
have
swerved
into
my
lane
the
squeegeed
pup
actually
got
up
and
headed
back
home
but
i
havent
seen
it
since

yes
even
when
steering
no
hands
you
do
something
quite
similar
to
countersteering
basically
to
turn
left
you
to
a
quick
wiggle
of
the
bike
to
the
right
first
causing
a
counteracting
lean
to
occur
to
the
left
this
sounds
suspiciously
like
black
magic
to
me
if
by
quick
wiggle
to
the
right
you
mean
that
the
handlebars
turn
toward
the
right
before
turning
to
the
left
what
is
the
input
to
the
steering
mechanism
that
makes
this
happen
in
the
absence
of
the
old
shoveshove
well
as
many
a
bored
bike
tourer
can
tell
you
the
way
to
steer
sans
hans
is
to
push
your
body
off
to
the
side
you
want
to
lean
say
you
want
to
turn
left
you
push
your
body
off
to
the
left
to
do
this
you
have
to
push
against
something
and
the
only
thing
to
push
against
is
the
ground
through
the
bike
well
the
apple
guy
wozniak
or
was
that
churchill
says
that
the
ground
will
push
you
right
back
so
you
pushed
yourself
off
to
the
left
by
pushing
on
the
ground
to
the
right
and
the
ground
pushed
back
toward
the
left
well
that
push
is
on
both
wheels
the
rear
wheel
doesnt
care
unless
you
have
serious
bearing
problems
except
of
course
on
the
spagthorpe
dragonfly
which
had
the
revolutionary
countersteeringcontrashaftdrive
rear
end
but
the
front
wheel
has
trail
if
the
ground
pushes
the
front
wheel
toward
the
left
at
the
contact
patch
the
trail
will
cause
the
wheel
to
turn
to
the
right

the

just

at

there
were

obviously
the

cecil

taint

im

surprisingly
the

real
cruiser
i
was
expecting
something
rough
shes
a

i
can
go
pretty
much
anyplace
id
take
my
mountain
bike
as
far
as
shaft

its
more
a
torque
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a
bit
maybe
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
not
to
start
another
shaft
effect
discussion
but
the
twist
you
feel
when
revving
sitting
still
is
due
to
the
larger
flywheels
that
the

the

beam
is
linear

that
you
get

it
really
picks

i
am
looking

now
and
i
wondered

make

the

the

most

some
with

strap
tankbag
and
because
the
rear
of
the
tank
is
so
narrow
the
fit
is
not
optimal
good
point
id
overlooked
that
the
eclipse
has
a
point
mount
at
the
rear
and
at
the
front
and
its
very
stable
on
the
fj
i
have
seen
some
with
harnesses
that
mount
to
the
sides
of
the
tank
and
that
would
be
a
real
problem

squeeze

hmmmm
why
does
everyone

seem
to
want
pillions
to
hang

rather
than
the

because
im

most
of

are
female
also
the
other
reasons
like
having
an

where
you

weight
is
it
being
a
more
comfortable
position
for
the
passenger
and
it
being
a

all
come
into
it
as
well
holding
the

rail
is
a
great
idea
only
for
braking
when
you
dont

just

why
is
it
that
some
people
cant
enjoy
themselves
without
being
assholes
if
you
want
to
be
treated
with
respect
you
need
to
treat
others
their
property
and
their
towns
with
respect
several
years
ago
i
was
at
the
annual
flyin
of
the
experimental
aircraft
association
eaa
near
oshkosh
wisconsin
although
approximately
people
were
in
attendance
there
was
not
a
piece
of
litter
anywhere
everyone
was
considerate
enough
to
place
their
trash
where
it
belonged
theres
no
problem
in
having
fun
raising
hell
etc
but
consideration
and
respect
for
others
is
critical
we
need
to
work
with
each
other
not
against
nudity
fineloud
noise
fineparty
all
night
fine
but
at
the
right
place
and
time
please
lets
not
trample
over
others
rights
and
then
bitch
because
they
dont
treat
us
like
gods
michael
menard
you
know
i
wasnt
even
going
to
respond
to
this
typical
antiparty
attitude
message
trash
was
everywhere
reason
not
enough
dipsy
dumpsters
for
the
massive
crowd
oatman
wasnt
prepared
for
the
vast
number
of
people
that
showed
up
btw
michael
oatman
is
the
right
place
time
its
called
a
run
maybe
you
didnt
read
my
comment
that
they
loved
us
and
im
talking
about
the
merchants
and
townspeople
the
merchants
that
didnt
want
us
their
shops
were
closed
maybe
i
should
have
mentioned
that
when
i
left
the
trash
was
being
picked
up
aluminum
sells
by
a
crew
assigned
to
the
task
i
think
the
bottom
line
here
is
do
they
want
us
back
they
do
this
action
that
went
on
at
oatman
is
typical
on
a
predominatly
harley
run
its
innocent
fun
so
since
i
enjoy
typical
harley
fun
at
runs
in
your
eyes
that
makes
me
an
asshole
ive
already
admitted
im
an

many

on

all
my

are

too

the

i
raised
the
to
expand

not

is
the
question
question
on

list
itself
there
were
mixed
feelings
the
list
has
always
been
open
to
anyone
with
a
nonbouncing
from
line
and
there
has
been
general
agreement
that
only
boxerrelated

is

almost
all
of

own

bikes
although
some
r
rt
and

are
also
on

at
this

my
main
interest
for
the

is
to
preserve
the
peace
and
comraderie
while
at
the
same
time
providing
as
wide
access
as
possible
the

is
fairly
technical
with
how
do
i
do
this

should
i
get

there
has

have

the

are
really
nice

arent
noticably
different
from
normal
grips
in

my
only
complaint
is
that
the
low
setting
might
as
well
be
off
this
has
been
complained
about
by
every
reviewer
official
and
unofficial
thats
ever
talked
about
these
grips
the
high
setting
is
often
too
high
for
use
with
lightweight
summer
gloves
when
things
just
get
a
bit
nippy
but
since
low
doesnt
produce
a
noticable
effect
i
end
up
turning
the
grips
on
and
off
to
keep
the
temperature
about
right
this
generally
isnt
a
problem
when
wearing
thicker
winter
gloves
when
i
asked
the
dealer
if
they
could
fix
it
i
received
a
consoling
pat
on

their

this

really
the

we

maybe
we
should
agree

disagree
ok
but
im
right
the
official
line
here
though
i
do
have
my
doubts
about
it
is
that
the
front
brake
is
applied
first
followed
by
the
rear
brake
the
idea
being
that
you
avoid
locking
up
the
rear
after
weight
transfer
takes
place
if
thats
the
official
line
taught
in
those
rider
education
classes
you
were
refering
to
that
also
dont
teach
countersteering
i
have
to
question
the
quality
of
the
classes
the
official
line
in
msf
curricula
is
as
i
described
maximum
braking
is
achieved
by
applying
both
brakes
equally
when
the
weight
distribution
is
nominally
even
and
both
tires
have
equal
normal
forces
and
easing
off
on
the
rear
to
prevent
locking
it
and
increasing
braking
on
the
front
as
more
traction
is
available
to
the
front
due
to
increased
normal
force
due
to
weight
shift
the
official
line
you
have
been
taught
seems
ineffective
on
the
face
of
it
applying
the
rear
brake
after
the
front
is
not
taking
advantage
of
all
the
traction
available
to
the
rear
at
time
and
is
halving
the
available
braking
power
by
using
only
the
front
at
time
saying
brake
until
the
tire
just
begins
to
slide
is
next
to
useless
advice
to
a
newbie
he
has
to
go
out
and
slide
the
tire
to
find
out
where
that
is
it
also
gives
him
zero
information
from
which
to
develop
a
braking
technique
that
changes
as
the
braking
and
corresponding
weight
shift
develop
if
you
dont
slide
the
tyre
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
youve
achieved
maximum
braking
or
not
im
not
suggesting
that
you
should
always
aim
to
brake
as
hard
as
you
possibly
can
but
if
you
want
to
find
the
limits
of
the
machine
you
have
to
go
beyond
them
not
necessarily
true
chirping
the
tire
indicates
impending
lockup
on
most
surfaces
and
serves
as
a
good
guide
to
newbies
to
indicate
maximum
braking
i
agree
that
totally
locking
the
front
occasionally
makes
one
a
better
rider
but
it
is
a
manuver
best
saved
for
an
experienced
rider
unless
you
have
one
of
those
outrigger
bikes
like
code
used
to
use
in
any
case
for
maximum
braking
if
as
i
suggested
you
aim
to
keep
both
wheels
just
on
the
point
of
sliding
then
youll
be
doing
exactly
as
you
suggest
true
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
how
to
best
teach
riding
skills
which
is
how
this
discussion
started
keep
both
wheels
just
on
the

of
sliding

nc
recently
last
few
years
decided
that
due
to
the
fact
there
are
constantly
people
on
the
road
drunk
driving
they
will
raise
their
awareness
of
it
by
making
stricter
laws
and
as
such
now
i
believe
nc
has
the
toughest
laws
for
dwi
while
not
necessarily
increasing
any
amount
of
awareness
or
kills
on
the
highways
meaning
its
only
made
a
difference
at
sentencing
automatic
revocation
of
your
license
for
a
year
im
not
sure
its
the
toughtest
law
around
but
nc
has
absolutely
no
sense
of
humor
with
respect
to
driving
laws
anyway
i
think
they
put
you
in
jail
and
sell
your
first
child
into
slavery
for
passing
a
school
bus
a
bill
breezed
through
the
nc
house
to
lower
the
intoxification
level
from
to
it
faces
stiff
opposition
in
the
senate
recently
the
highway
patrol
took
a
few
of
the
opposition
senators
out
and
gave
them
some
shots
and
when
they
hit
put
them
on
a
course
dodging
cones
they
failed
and
will
probably
change
their
votes
as
a
result
for
some
bizarre
reason
nc
is
the
only
state
where
the
governer
has
no
veto
power
over
legislation
coming
out
of
the
state
congress
so
his
opinion
on
the
matter
is

advice
for
riding
with

on

ive
never
ridden

very
much
but
recently
had
an
excellent
experience
passengering
with
dave
edmondson
at
pilot
while
in
london
i
found
that
it
upset
the
bike
much
less
if
i
rode
with
the
pilot
that
is
if
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
anticipated
when
i
should
hold
on
hard
for
braking
or
acceleration
i
tried
to
always
look
over
the
inside
shoulder
on
corners
and
move
as
little
as
possible
leaving
dave
to
manage
me
and
the
bike
as
he
normally
would
the
bike
and
luggage
hard
acceleration
can
be
quite
unnerving
as
the
feeling
of
being
spit
off
the
back
is
hard
to
fight
similarly
i
held
on
to
the
grab
handles
tightly
when
dave
needed
to
brake
so
as
not
to
mash
him
to
a
pulp
im
a
lot
bigger
than
he
is
reaching
around
him
and
pushing
off
the
tank
seemed
like
it
would
be
very
awkward
and
make
it
even
harder
for
him
to
manage
on
the
rare
occasions
when
i
carry
a
passenger
myself
i
absolutely
refuse

its
my

want

i
agree
with
an
earlier
poster
if
youve
not
had
much
experience
carrying
a
particular
passenger
and
especially
if
youve

carried
many

take
a

dog
attack
my
previous
posting
on
dog
attacks
must
have
generated
some
bad
karma
or
something
ive
weathered
attempted
dog
attacks
before
using
the
approved
method
slow
down
to
screw
up
dogs
triangulation
of
target
then
take
off
and
laugh
at
the
dog
now
far
behind
you
this
time
it
didnt
work
because
i
didnt
have
time
riding
up
the
hill
leading
to
my
house
i
encountered
a
liverandwhite
springer
spaniel
no
relation
to
the
springer
softail
or
the
springer
spagthorpe
a
close
relation
to
the
spagthorpe
viking
actually
the
dog
encountered
me
with
intent
to
harm
but
i
digress
i
was
riding
near
the
unpainted
centerline
of
the
roughly
wide
road
doing
between
forty
and
sixty
clicks
mph
for
the
velocityimpaired
the
dog
shot
at
me
from
behind
bushes
on
the
left
side
of
the
road
at
an
impossibly
high
speed
i
later
learned
he
had
been
accelerating
from
the
front
porch
about
thirty
feet
away
heading
down
the
very
gently
sloped
approach
to
the
side
of
the
road
i
saw
the
dog
and
before
you
could
say
sipde
he
was
on
me
boom
i
took
the
dog
in
the
left
leg
and
from
the
marks
on
the
bike
my
leg
was
driven
up
the
side
of
the
bike
with
considerable
force
making
permanent
marks
on
the
plastic
parts
of
the
bike
and
cracking
one
panel
i
think
i
saw
the
dog
spin
around
when
i
looked
back
but
my
memory
of
this
moment
is
hazy
i
next
turned
around
and
picked
the
most
likely
looking
house
the
apologetic
woman
explained
that
the
dog
was
not
seriously
hurt
cut
mouth
and
hoped
i
was
not
hurt
either
i
could
feel
the
pain
in
my
shin
and
expected
a
cool
purple
welt
to
form
soon
sadly
it
has
not
so
im
left
with
a
tender
shin
and
no
cool
battle
scars
interestingly
the
one
thing
that
never
happened
was
that
the
bike
never
moved
off
course
the
not
inconsiderable
impact
did
not
push
the
bike
off
course
nor
did
it
cause
me
to
put
the
bike
out
of
control
from
some
gut
reaction
to
the
sudden
impact
delayed
pain
may
have
helped
me
here
as
i
didnt
feel
a
sudden
sharp
pain
that
i
can
remember
what
worries
me
about
the
accident
is
this
i
dont
think
i
could
have
prevented
it
except
by
traveling
much
slower
than
i
was
this
is
not
necessarily
an
unreasonable
suggestion
for
a
residential
area
but
i
was
riding
around
the
speed
limit
i
worry
about
what
would
have
happened
if
it
had
been
a
car
instead
of
a
dog
but
i
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
would
take
a
truly
insane
bdi
cager
to
whip
out
of
a
blind
driveway
at
mph
for
that
matter
how
many
driveways
are
long
enough
for
a
car
to
hit
mph

the

are

anyone

i

the

at
is
that

this
the

i
thought
that
with

that
the

give
more

any
comments
a
friend
told
me
he
thought
that
my
bike
had
boranni
rims
which
are
very
good
but
are
relatively
soft
and
have
delicate
sidewalls
i
do
not
wish
to
mount
the
tires
myself
this
first
time
so
aside
from
warning
the
shop
to
be
careful
any
other
comments
i
should
make
i
havnt
looked
at
the
rim
to
check
out
the
make
yet
if
it
is
marked
he
just
told
me
late
yesterday
and
i
havnt
had
a
chance
to
check
the
rim
type
on
another
note
i
will
remove
the
ugly
but
in
good
shapeanyone
want
it
vetter
fairing
and
i
will
run
without
a
windscreen
for
a
while
but
eventually
i
would
like
a
simple
rounded
cafe
style
quarter
fairing
for
it
it
could
be
forkhandlebar
mounted
any
suggestions
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
frame
mounted
quarter
fairing
of
the
cafe
style
for
this
bike
how
about
lower
barsclipons
for
it
i
would
like
to
restore
the
bike
into
a
good
condition
runner
with
a
few
modern
updates
but
while
not
being
historically
exactly
accurate
still
have
it
reflect
relatively
well
a
representation
of
the
cafe
style
yes
i
know
to
be
picky
that
period
really
predates
this

is
just
that
this

has
such
potential

the

him

i
saw

think

someone
said

me
a

fires
well
heres
some
additional
insight
and
some
theories
about
splitfire
plugs
and
how
they
boost
us
as
oppossed
to
cages
splitfires
were
originally
made
to
burn
fuel
more
efficiently
and
increased
power
for
the
cages
well
for
these
guys
splitfires
now
i
dont
know
about
all
of
this
and
im
trying
to
catch
up
with
somebody
about
it
now
but
splitfires
should
help
twins
more
than
splitfires
work
mainly
by
providing
a
moreorless
unshrouded
spark
to
the
combustion
chamber
if
an
engines
cylinder
head
design
can
benefit
from
this
then
the
splitfires
will
yield
a
slight
performance
increase
most
noticeably
in
lower
rpm
range
torque
splitfires
didnt
do
diddlysquat
for
my
gmc
pickup
but
do
give
a
noticeable
performance
boost
in
my
harley
sportster
and
my
best
friends
sportster
folks
i
know
whove
tried
them
in
evo
motors
cant
tell
any
performance
boost
over
plain
plugs
which
is
interesting
since
the
xlh
and
big
twin
evo
combustion
chambers
are
pretty
much
the

shape
just
different
sizes
two
of
my
friends
who
have
shovelhead
harleys
swear
by
the
splitfires
but
if
i
had
a
shovelhead
id
dualplug
it
instead
since
they
respond
well
enough
to
dual
plugs
to
make
the
machine
work
and
extra
ignition
system
worth
the
expense
plus
they
look
really
cool
with

the
thighs
fit

had

waist
but
cut

in

legs
i
have
large
muscular
thighs
and
no
i
didnt
use
the
thighmaster
to
get
them
the
jacket
fits
me
ok
in
the
chest
slightly
snug
at
the
waist
and
too
small
in
the
arms
i
cant
imagine
finding
a
onepiece
size
that
would
have
fit
correctly
as
even
the
piece
has
its
problems
strange
since
my
vpilot
jacket
fits
great
all
over
and
when
i
tried
the
matching
pants
they
fit
like
a
glove
as
well
i
can
only
assume
the
models
aero
design
uses
to
design
its
suits
are
in
some
way
different
from
us
real
folks
also
even
though
its
related
to
convienience
you
look
pretty
damn
wierd
walking
around
with
the
tops
and
bottoms
while
running
errands
ive
gotten
some
really
suspicious
looks
and
sweated
a
lot
while
in
a
store
wearing
the
whole
suit
since
you
cant
fit
the
top
and
bottom
in
any
motorcycle
storage
device
yet
devised
except
the
trunk
in
my
sidecar
rig
with
the
two
piece
i
unzip
the
pants
i
generally
leave
the
two
pieces
zipped
together
primarily
because
the
pants
fall
down
unless
i
pull
the
cheesy
elastic
belttype
band
real
tight
stuff
them
in
one
of
my
spacious
bmw
saddlebags
the
pants
just
fit
and
run
errands
just
wearing
the
jacket
actually
if
i
know
ill
be
running
errands
i
just
wear
my
vpilot
jacket
but
thats
just
me
as
far
as
crash
protection
id
say
that
both
suits
are
probably
equal
it
seems
that
for
weather
protection
if
anything
the
piece
provides
a
little
more
because
of
the
jacket
overlapping
the
pants
by
inches
the
piece
is
probably
a
little
less
comfortable
around
the
waist
just
because
of
the
extra
layer
of
stuff
but
maybe
not
so
id
have
to
vote
for
the
two
piece
despite
the
slightly
odd
fit
i
still
find
the
suit
the
most
versatile
piece
of
riding
clothing
i
own

black
reflector
tape
a
few
months
ago
in
one
the
the
motorcycle
mags
there
was
an
article
that
mentioned
reflector
tape
that
was
supposed
to
be
available
thru
bmw
the
idea
was
that
the
tape
would
look
black
in
sunlight
and
reflect
in
other
colors
at
night
to
headlights
it
sounded
like
a
nice
way
to
add
nighttime
visibility
without
turning
the
bike
into
a
carnival
attraction
i
talked
to
the
local
bmw
dealer
about
this
i
was
told
that
the
only
thing
he
had
heard
about
this
kind
of
reflector
was
it
being
used
in
a
coming
line
of
bmw
clothing
rainsuits
he
wasnt
aware
of
anything
regarding
self
applied
tape
has

a

overnight
about
minute
ride
rode
up
after
work
only
minor
drizzing
for
the
last
minutes
of
the
ride
rest
of
the
ride
was
very
zen
got
up
this
morning
needed
to
go
home
and
get
some
disks
stuff
to
work
on
her
computers
with
rainy
as
all
hell
soaked
and
cold
by
the
time
i
got
home
since
i
didnt
have
another
set
of
thermals
which
were
dry
i
said
to
heck
with
it
and
drove
my
cage
back
up
lo
and
behold
those
funny
blue
clouds
were
up
in
the
sky
and
this
warm
yellow
thing
i
havent
seen
in
quite
awhile
showed
up
when
i
was
minutes
into
the
trip
and
me
in
my
cage
oh
joy
happily
my
right
hand
mirror
finally
showed
up
at
the
dealer
dropped
the
bike
when
i
first
got
it
put
on
an
emgo
replacement
mirror
hated
it
the
entire
time
that
thing
was
on
my
bike
because
i
couldnt
see
a
damned
thing
through
it
plus
its
flat
instead
of
convex
like
the
stock
mirrors
so
you
get
a
narrow
angle
wobbly
blur
and
i
got
a
replacement
windshield
for
my
fairing
dropped
the
original
and
chipped
the
front
edge
cosmetic
but
annoying
so
i
spent
half
an
hour
happily
unscrewing
things
and
replacing
them
this
afternoon
bout
the
only
thing
i
still
hate
about
the

it
has
to
be
the

really
nice
riding
day
of
spring
the
bike
is
back
together
again
and
so
are
you
grab
all
your
gear
put
it
on
and
fill
the
tank
with
octane
premium
or
better
head
out
in
ames
there
is
a
road
that
leads
to
the
little
town
of
gilbert
gilbert
has
one
stop
light
if
that
tells
you
something
having
just
gotten
the
bike
back
together
i
thought
id
take
it
for
a
short
ride
and
check
things
out
heading
out
of
town
i
went
into
the
twisties
at
a
slow
pace
just
under
the
speed
limit
and
started
leaning
around
the
pace
quickened
as
everything
felt
just
right
finally
the
road
straightened
and
i
was
ready
for
a
bit
of
speed
grab
third
gear
open
her
up
at
roughly
grab
fourth
gear
look
at
as
much
of
the
bike
as
you
can
and
fail
to
notice
a
state
trooper
following
a
quarter
mile
behind
twist
the
throttle
like
a
fool
grab
fifth
gear
at
or
so
and
see
just
how
well
shes
been
put
back
together
at
according
to
radar
i
noticed
the
front
fender
was
flexing
a
bit
thus
i
slowed
pulled
off
the
road
removed
my
helmet
and
gloves
unslung
the
took
kit
i
was
carrying
in
a
fanny
pack
and
was
just

when
the
trooper
pulled
in
all
hot
and
flustered
have
you
any

how
fast
you
were
going
not

no
i
was

and
road
not

instruments
i
just

back

last
night
and
im
just

testing
her
out
before
i

it

says

were

the

well
be

some
twisty
fairly
bumpy
roads
the

for
you
sf
bay
areans
this

is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
my
fiancee
and
i
do
quite
a
bit
of
sporty
riding
ill
tell
you
what
weve
found
and
the
systems
weve
worked
out
on
starts
accelerate
much
slower
than
usual
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
acceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
remember
this
on
turns
have
her
lean
forward
and
at
the
same
angle
as
you
normally
this
means
she
isnt
leaning
at
all
its
very
disconcerting
to
be
leaned
over
and
have
your
passenger
leaning
so
that
theyre
sitting
straight
up
much
balance
is
lost
and
this
can
be
dangerous
on
slowing
and
stopping
do
so
much
slower
than
usual
again
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
deceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
however
youll
figure
it
out
fast
because
braking
too
fast
will
shove
the
passenger
forward
into
you
which
shoves
you
into
the
tank
at
an
inopportune
location
generally
have
the
passenger
keep
her
knees
against
you
and
the
bike
not
out
wide
this
helps
balance
and
gives
her
somegrip
when
you
passenger
is
in
fear
she
will
squeeze
her
knees
against
you
normally
this
means
slow
down
and
do
it
now
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
we
only
have
a
couple
signals
slow
down
is
her
either
tapping
me
on
the
back
or
slapping
my
helmet
with
all
her
might
depends
on
the
urgency
of
the
matter
turn
here
is
done
by
her
pointing
in
the
direction
of
an
exit
this
is
also
the
sign
for
cool
look
at
that
i
hafta
pee
is
the
same
sign
as
turn
here
im
hungry
is
the
same
sign
go
faster
is
usually
done
by
her
jumping
up
and
down
on
her
pegs
in
glee
i
usually
see
slow
down
more
often
than
go
faster
i
really
want
this
to
be
a
positive
experience
for
us
both
mainly
so
that
shell
want
to
go
with
me
again
so
any
help
will
be
appreciated
the
best
thing
to
do
before
the
ride
is
to
talk
to
a
riding
buddy
and
pillion
on
his
or
her
bike
its
incredibly
frustrating
because
youre
in
almost
no
control
now
multiply
that
feeling
times
ten
because
you
as
a
rider
know
what
your
bike
will
do
and
your
passenger
will
likely
feel
youre
about
to
scrape
hard
parts
all
the
time
or
lock
up
the
brakes
at
any
moment
or
go
careening
off
the
edge
of
a
volcanic
mountain
etc
pillioning
yourself
is
good
training
to
take
somebody
on
your
pillion
pad
also
remember
that
its
much
more
draining
and
tiring
to
ride
than
by
yourself
because
youre
concentrating
on
much
more
and
in

the

unless

do
not

on

route
for
her
first
extended

thats
kinda
like
taking
someone
on
a
noshow
speed
star
competition
as
their
first
skydive
this
person
is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont

weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
i
want
her
to
hold
onto
me
rather
than
the
grab
rail
out
back
and
ive
heard
that
she
should
look
over
my
shoulder
in
the
direction
were
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
if
the
ninja
has
adjustable
suspension
adjust
it
to
a
stiffer
setting
so
you
dont
bottom
out
in
bumpy
curves
tell
her
the
cardinal
rules
are
a
never
ever
ever
ever
put
her
feet
down
not
when
you
stop
at
a
stop
sign
not
when
she
thinks
youre
gonna
crash
never
keep
them
on
the
pegs
until
you
tell
her
to
get
off
the
bike
b
she
is
to
hold
onto
your
waist
she
should
hold
on
tightly
enough
that
she
wont
slide
off
the
bike
if
you
twist
the
throttle
a
bit
and
added
bonus
for
you
here
she
should
keep
as
close
to
your
butt
as
possible
so
quick
stops
dont
make
her
slide
into
you
and
knock
your
balls
up
onto
the
gas
tank
you
decide
how
best
to
word
this
c
just
stay
perpendicular
to
the
bike
straight
up
in
the
seat
dont
lean
your
body
into
curves
just
go
with
the
bike
and
stay
perpendicular
dont
look
over
your
shoulder
remember
at
all
times
that
you
have
a
passenger
on
the
back
that
means
dont
pop
the
clutch
and
try
to
corner
and
stop
smoother
than
usual
be
aware
that
if
you
jump
on
the
brake
youre
going
to
have
the
equivalent
of
a
lb
dead
weight
crashing
into
you
from
behind
so
be
prepared
for
that
make
sure
she
pisses
before
the
ride
even
if
she
says
she
doesnt
have
to
go
no
antiwomen
stuff
here
i
have
a
tiny
bladder
myself
remind
her
to
look
around
while
youre
riding
point
to
things
of
interest
it
makes
the
ride
more
enjoyable
to
her
she
wont
get
so
focused
on
just
looking
at
the
back
of
your
helmet
and
it
gives
her
ample
excuse
to
squeeze
you
to
show
she
saw
what
you
pointed
at
my
wife
and
i
tried
the
msfrecommended
look
over
the
riders
shoulder
in
curves
bit
and
it
just
didnt
work
the
timing
of
her
weight
shift
was
unpredictable
especially
on
the
maxim
because
unlike
the
ninja
the
upright
riding
position
really
restricts
the
pillions
view
of
the
road
ahead
next
time
i
had
her
just
remain
perpendicular
to
the
bike
and
i
could
hardly
tell
there
was
someone
else
on
the
bike
in

she

a

for
ya
today
i
was

degree
corner
just
like
on
any
other
day
but
there
was
a
slight
difference
a
rough
spot
right
in
my
path
caused
the
suspension
to
compress
in
mid
corner
and
some
part
of
the
bike
hit
the
ground
with
a
very
tangible
thunk
i
pulled
over
at
first
opportunity
to
sus
out
the
damage
my
bike
is
a
kawasaki
with
footpegs
that
are
hinged
and
sprung
such
that
they
fold
upward
and
backward
on
contact
with
ground
etc
and
on
the
lower
extreme
corner
of
each
peg
there
is
mounted
a
bankfollower
or
a
little
stud
that
theoretically
is
the
first
bit
to
hit
the
ground
in
a
turn
the
stud
is
mounted
on
the
footpeg
by
a
threaded
bit
about
mm
long
which
screws
into
a
threaded
hole
in
the
footpeg
now
for
the
mystery
the
stud
on
the
side
of
the
bike
that
clunked
when
i
turned
was
absent
im
fairly
sure
it
was
there
before
the
event
there
was
no
damage
to
the
end
of
the
footpeg
where
the
stud
would
ordinarily
have
been
in
fact
the
thread
in
the
hole
in
the
footpeg
was
perfectly
intact
with
no
evidence
of
something
having
been
forcefully
ripped
out
of
it
only
moments
previously
okay

you
rip
a

thread
out

without
damaging
the
thread
in
the
hole
is
this
some
sort
of
hitech
design
thingo
that
kawasaki
never
mentioned
like
that
the
end
of
the
footpeg
suddenly
changes

rip
out

of
gas
to
buy
depending
on
the
compression
ratio
of
your
engine
i
heard
ok
but
what
kind
of
gas
goes
for
what
kind
of
compression
im
asking
this
because
i
used
to
put
in
my
hawk
gt
and
the
other
day
i
changed
because
i
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
a
difference
and
i
dont
know
if
im
being
subjective
or
what
but
it
seems
like
the
bike
runs
better
run
your
bike
on
the
lowest
octane
that
it
will
run
smoothly
on
higher
octane
fuel
is
not
better
than
lower
octane
gas
pick
up
the
last
american
roadracing
magazine
theres
a
short
article
in
there
about
octane
and
the
misconceptions
many
people
make
about
the
subject
look
at
your
owners
manual
i
believe
it
states
is
just
fine

in

lets
mutate
take
your

by
the

on
tuesday
morning
i
spent
a
couple
of
hours
when
i
should
have
been
working
with
a
torch
brazing
bits
of
scrap
metal
over
the
biggest
holes
in
yamadogs
exhaust
pipes
smazin
what
you
can
do
with
a
couple
of
aa
cells
and
a
threevolt
bulb
i
stuck
some
gungum
into
the
smaller
holes
and
bunged
the
pipes
back
onto
the
bike
so
last
night
im
on
the
way
home
when
lo
an
bloody
behold
the
sodding
thing
starts
blowing
again
i
check
it
out
and
the
gas
is
escaping
from
around
the
clamp
holding
the
number
two
pipe
into
the
port
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
being
somewhat
hole
of
calcutta
at
the
time
the
nuts
are
still
there
stop
that
bloody
sniggering
you
at
the
back
but
the
pipe
is
a
bit
loose
this
morning
i
go
out
to
the
bike
and
pull
out
the
socketset
to
tighten
up
me
nuts
somebody
give
that
spotty
kid
at
the
back
a
good
slap
round
the
back
of
the
head
and
lo
an

i
find
that

in

its

for

it

i

thursday

really
i
just
made
a

type

really
is
was
your

the
nyloncoil
type
or
the
kind
with
molded
plastic

ive
only
tried
it
on
the
coiled
nylon
type
and
it
doesnt
take
much
squish
to
fix
the
problem
i
found
i
was
overdoing
it
no
broken
parts
but
the
zipper
was
too
hard
to
pull
so
after
spreading
the
zipper
pull
jaws
again
i
tried
with
vicegrips
no
not
the
usual
grip
of
death
technique
i
adjusted
the
closed
vicegrips
so
they
were
snug
on
the
zipper
jaws
then
released
them
and
tightened
the
adjusting
screw
a
bit
a
couple
of
iterations
and
i
had
just
the
right
amount
of
zipper
squish
tm
result
i
now
know

noplace

will
even
consider
trying

i

replacement
was
pretty
simple
just
break
and
remove
the
plastic
knob
at

of
the

that
keeps

from

by

many

to

after

would

with

did
the

make
any
distinction
between
an
ability

a
failure
to
swerve
in
most
of
the
accidents
and
near
accidents
that
ive
seen
riders
will
almost
always
stand
on
the
brakes
as
hard
as
they
dare
simply
because
the
instinct
to
brake
in
the
face
of
danger
is
so
strong
that
it
overrides
everything
else
hard
braking
and
swerving
tend
to
be
mutually
exclusive
manouvres
did
hurt
draw
any
conclusions
on
which
one
is
generally
preferable
apparently
the
instinct
to
brake
in
the
face
of
danger
isnt
as
strong
as
the
instinct
to
freeze
up
and
do
nothing
in
the
face
of
danger
hurt
found
that
a
surprising
number
of
accidentinvolved
motorcyclists
hadnt
used
their
brakes
at
all
prior
to
impact
i
think
the
only
way
youll
ever
use
countersteering
reliably
and
correctly
in
a
crisis
is
to
make
it
the
only
conscious
method
of
directional
control
you
ever
use
and
to
practice
it
constantly
even
when
you
have
no
need
to
do
any
turning
if
you
follow
me
down
a
long
straight
and
i
seem
to
be
wiggling
back
and
forth
randomly
or
suddenly
without
obvious
need
its
because
im
practicing
countersteering
and
avoiding
imaginary
obstacles
directly
in
my
path
all
of
this
practice
may
indeed
be
futile
but
if
i
have
even
milliseconds
to
react
the
most
familiar
tactic
available
and
hopefully
the
most
automatic
will
be
countersteering
the
same
logic
applies
to
braking
with
the

brake

it
in

if

it
sounds
a

like
we
might
have
a
whole
townfull
from
lynns
description
especially
if
the
same
crowd
gets
invited
back
to
party
some
more
year
after
year
sure
you
didnt
rape
and
pillage
its
a
relief
to
know
that
you
were
such
gentlemen
but
because
you
were
not
completely
outofhand
you
justify
your
lesser
indescretions
some
pretty
distorted
thinking
i
should
say
you
seem
to
be
one
of
very
few
bent
out
of
shape
over
these
lesser
indiscretions
if
the
townspeople
arent
ruffled
by
the
indiscretions
and
the
partyers
arent
either
maybe
the
indiscretions
dont
amount
to
anything
more
threatening
or
damaging
than
harmless
goodnatured
rowdiness
among
consenting
adults
the
only
thing
that
really
bothered
me
about
the
description
was
the
kneedeep
empty
beer
cans
in
the
street
but
maybe
the
town
had
a
plan
to
deal
with
that
since
they
helped
set
up
the
party
in
the
first
place
if
i
lived
there
and
the
bikers
previous
visits
had
established
a
record
of
mutual
cooperation
and
good
intentions
id
certainly
rather
they
stick
around
and
party
than
go
riding
off
into
the
night
impaired
and
maybe
get
hurt
or
killed
oh
im
sorry
i
just
noticed
that
you
left
mucho
bucks
as
in
money
nevermind
my
criticism
i
was
out
of
line
i
forgot
that
when
one
leaves
mucho
bucks
as
in
money
their
behavior
is
permissable
perhaps
even
justified
if
it
doesnt
hurt
anyone
and
all
the
parties
to
the
party
benefit
and
consider
the
entire
activity
to
be
benign
and
harmless
then
who
needs
to
permit
or
justify
it
you
why
do
you
need
to
do
that
keep
in

that
themfolks
are
the

a

institute

the
ones
that
dont
respect
our
rights
on
the
roads
because
we
do
not
respect
theirs
all
the
rest
of
the
time
ironically
these
particular
townsfolk
probably
are
in
the
minority
that
dont

to
fit

you

developed
a

its
the
moroon
flying
up
right
behind
me
in
my
panic
i
pop
my
clutch
and
stall
the

luckily
the

stops
a
foot
behind
my
rear
wheel
i
understand
why
you
theoretically
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
the
experience
you
describe
is
why
i
dont
like
to
sit
with
my
bike
in
gear
i
figure
theres
a
chance
that
ill
be
startled
in
some
way
and
stall
my
bike
and
i
figure
this
is
more
likely
than
the
chance
that
ill
be
unable
to
escape
some
situation
because
of
the
extra
time
needed
to
put
the
bike
in
gear
so
i
concentrate
on
avoiding
situations
rather
than
making
splitsecond
evasive
manuvers
i
split
lanes
so
im
not
at
the
end
of
the
line
unfortunately
this
is
not
legal
in
most
of
the
country
if
i
cant
split
perhaps
there
isnt
room
then
i
will
stop
near
one
side
of
the
lane
so
i
have
an
easy
escape
and
leave
my
bike
in
gear
until
the
next
car
has
stopped
i
watch
in
my
mirrors
in
the
mean
time
to
make
sure
it
will
whether
i
really
would
have
time
to
move
should
a
car
fail
to
stop
i
havent
had
to
find
out
yet
some
cars
have
an
annoying
habbit
of
racing
up
behind
you
before
braking
heavilly
so
it
can
be
hard
to
tell
if
they
are
planning
to
brake
or
not
so
in
summary
position
yourself
for
an
easy
exit

watch

heres
some
important
details
ive
been
riding
for
years
my
own
bikes
for
the
past
years
michelle
has
been
riding
for
the
past
years
her
own
bikes
ive
only
been
involved
in
one
accident
which
was
caused
by
a
cage
driver
running
a
stop
sign
i
currently
own
a
bmw
michelle
owns
a
yamaha
virago
we
prefer
cruising
over
racing
weve
toured
a
fair
amount
were
both
licensed
and
insured
and
were
nice
people
so
if
anyone
has
a
bike
or
bikes
but
the
second
one
would
have
to
be
a
virago
or
something
else
with
an
equally
low
seat
that
they
would
be
willing
to
loan
us
for
days
in
july
michelle
and
i
would
be
eternally
grateful
in
addition
to
our
friendship
you
would
also
have
the
use
of
our
bikes
should
you
ever
pass
through
minneapolis
in
exchange
we
would
be
happy
to
take
you
and
a
guest
out
for
dinner
and
an
evening
of
wild
bike
stories
or
we
might
even
be
willing
to
cough
up
some
money
for
improvements
to
the
bikes
like
new
tires
or
something
also
any
information
about
bike
rentals
in
the
boston
area
would
be
greatly
appreciated

squids
and
dealers
yesterday
a
friend
had
asked
me
to
accompany
him
to
a
local
motorcycle
dealer
it
has
been
a
while
since
he
last
rode
years
and
i
myself
have
never
bought
a
new
bike
from
a
dealer
what
follows
is
an
experience
of
that
visit
and
of
an
observation
of
squildly
behavior
by
other
customers
andor
sales
personel
background
i
ride
with
a
group
of
friends
who
mainly
are
into
cruiser
type
bikes
my
friend
was
hell
bent
on
getting
an
intruder
and
had
seen
a
few
used
ones
he
wanted
to
see
what
the
new
ones
were
going
for
so
we
happened
upon
a
dealer
that
sold
both
suzuki
and
yamaha
the
place
was
fairly
busy
so
we
browsed
a
bit
we
happened
upon
a
few
intruders
most
of
which
had
sold
signs
on
my
friend
had
been
bitten
well
the
salesdroid
appeared
and
as
my
friend
started
chewing
the
fat
i
moseid
on
outside
the
next
thing
i
know
i
see
or
sport
bikes
pull
in
i
could
stereotype
the
type
of
riders
backward
ball
hat
oakley
iq
but
i
wont
well
they
went
inside
i
didnt
think
much
of
it
i
figured
to
each
his
own
i
went
back
in
to
see
if
the
salesdroid
had
his
fangs
firmly
implanted
into
my
friends
back
when
i
noticed
the
hormone
gang
talking
to
other
salesdroidsmanagers
lots
of
laughter
jokes
etc
no
big
deal
here
is
the
part
that
concerned
me
the
hg
and
those
shop
personel
that
were
not
busy
with
customers
went
back
out
where
said
hg
members
fired
up
their
rides
and
did
the
obligatory
reving
up
of
those
beasts
at
this
point
one
decided
to
see
how
much
rubber
a
katana
could
deposit
in
the
drive
squids
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
was
appalled
that
the
salesdroidsmanager
not
only
condoned
this
behavior
but
encourged
it
to
the
point
were
they
were
betting
how
long
he
could
keep
it
up
and
egged
him
on
to
pull
a
wheely
as
he
rode
off
onto
a
busy
street
around
rush
hour
the
girl
that
was
riding
pillion
on
another
bike
seemed
rather
hormonal
about
this
display
and
urged
her
pilot
to
quickly
catch
up
the
others
followed
making
sure
there
kerkers
could
be
heard
as
well
as
felt
i
felt
embarassed
at
this
point
to
be
a
motorcyclist
i
felt
the
eyes
of
those
in
cages
witnessing
this
display
then
glancing
over
to
the
dealers
lot
and
damning
all
those
on
two
wheels
needless
to
say
my
friend
felt
a
little
uncomfortable
and
we
left
i
will
now
turn
off
my
frustration
and
go
ride
peacefully
to
clear
my
anger
i
only
hope
that
the
cop
who
is
following
me
home
has
an
open
mind
and
doesnt
associate
me
with
them

that
the

the
idea
being
methat
you
avoid
locking
up
the

after
weight
transfer
takes
place
if
thats
the
official
line
taught

you
were

that
also
dont

i
have
to
question
the
quality
of

me
too
though
unfortunately
the
official
line
is
the
one
that
you
have
to
adhere
to
if
you
want
to
get
a
full
licence
the
examiners
guidelines
are
laid
down
by
the
government
and
the
basic
rider
education
courses
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
them
it
surprises
me
that
none
of
the
rider
groups
here
either
mag
or
the
bmf
make
much
noise
about
the
fact
that
the
riding
test
requires
you
to
ride
three
feet
from
the
kerb
all
the
time
in
order
to
pass
that
the
front
brake
must
be
applied
before
the
rear
that
you
have
to
keep
looking
over

when

the

i

shes

honey
and
i
can
go
pretty

anyplace
id
take
my

bike
as
far
as
shaft

its
more
a
torque
effect
from
the
crankshaft
in
my
opinion
rev
it
sitting
still
when
the
driveshaft
is
not
moving
and
the
bike
twists
a
bit
maybe
if
the
clutch
is
in
then
a
large
chunk
of
counterrotating
mass
is
not
rotating
hence
at
a
light
reving
makes
it
twist
shaft
effect
is
the
rear
end
rising
under
power
or
the
real
problem
getting
lower
to
the
road
when
the
throttle
is
snapped
shut
say
when
you
are
cornering
and
the
heads
are
real
close
to
the
road
new
gs
bikes
with
the
paralever
shaft
have
almost
no
shaft
effect
i
dont
ride
her
fast
enough
to
get
a
shaft
effect
but
in
my
opinion
a
little
buffeting
by
wind
is
of
far
greater
consequence
okay
here
are
my
questions
any
recommendations
for
a
homemade
fairing
id
like
to
keep
the
wind
off
my
chest
and
perhaps
my
helmet
for
comfort
at
highway
speeds
mph
yet
dont
want
to
a
screw
up
the
stability
or
b
block
my
vision
too
much
for
trail
riding
anybody
have
luck
with
twopiece
detachible
fairings
id
like
to
make
it
myself
out

plexiglas
i
run
two
lights
the
standard
headlamp
plus
a
sidelamp
mounted
on

crash
bar
the
illuminations
excellent
that
way
with
a
full
beam
coming
out
from
the
level
of
the
motor
left
side
the
lamp
beam
is
linear
so
that
you
get
a
bright
streak
of
illumination
from
left
to
right
and
it
really
picks
up
the
periphery
deer
lurking
etc
combined
with
the
headlamp
on
high
you
can
see
like
day
but
ive
heard
that
bmw
alternators
dont
crank
out
too
much
do
i
need
to
shut
down
the
sidelamp
when
im
puttering
around
in
the
dirt
at
low
rpm
its
a
question
of
how
long
you
spend
at
low
rpm
and
how
much
you
need
the
extra
light
at
low
rpm
and
under
they
dont
charge
all
that
much
if
at
all
the
alternators
put
out
sufficient
wattage
it
just
that
you
need
to
be
at
rpm
to
get
it
this
is
embarassing
im
having
trouble
starting
the
bike
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
invariably
flood
the
carbs
then
go
in

read
a

paper
and
then
she
starts
right
up
is
this
a
zen
thing
full
choke
open
the
gas
taps
hit
the
starter
and
ever
so
slightly
blip
the
throttle
it
should
fire
cranking
should
be
done
with
minimal
throttle
my
likes
the
throttles
to
be
raised
just
a
bit
off
idle
its
an
experience
thing
like
zen
its
hard
to

it
can
be
hard

if
my

been
sitting
for

weeks
i
give
it
a
short
while
to
start
if
it
doesnt
i
turn
it
off
and
wait
a
few
minutes
for
things
to
vaporize
in
the
fuel
system
and
then
it
lights
right
off
ive

dual

make

that
the

that
the

a
three

high

both

well
the

ergonomics
of
the

make
it

sure
enough
as
deam
expected
when
you
balance
the
toggle
switch
in
the
center
position
both
the
high

low

go
on
this
provides
a
very
nice

this
is
true
for

and
i
would
expect
for

standard
two

light
switch
its
a
make

type
of

if

it
ought
to
be
for

there
might
be
a
wee
problem
with
this
if
you
use
both
filaments
at
the

time
the

is
tossing
out

possibly
enough

a
cage
that
really
wanted

had
wimpy
stock
lights
so
we
used
to
run
around
with
both
beams
on
made
a

big
difference
until
both
low

filaments
died
nearly
simultaneously
this
was
two
weeks
after
finding
out
how
nice
it
was
to
use

re
dogs
vs

my
first
encounter
with
a
dog
chasing
after
my
bike
was
on
my
first
poker
run
a
big
german
shepard
ran
out
into
the
pack
of
bikes
i
was
riding
with
and
tried
to
bite
the
right
leg
of
the
guy
riding
in
front
of
me
he
kicked
the
dog
a
couple
of
times
we
were
all
only
going
about
and
just
made
the
dog
angrier
and
got
away
by
applying
wfo
and
outrunning
the
dog
who
then
started
after
yours
truly
at
the
time
i
had
open
drag
pipes
obnoxiously
loud
as
hell
and
as
soon
as
the
dog
was
about
feet
away
from
the
right
side
of
my
bike
i
pulled
in
the
clutch
and
revved
the
motor
up
to
about
and
the
roar
of
the
pipes
frightened
the
dog
away
probably
made
the
dogs
ears
hurt
like
hell
and
he
didnt
come
back
for
the
rest
of
the
bikers
behind
me
either
my
second
encounter
was
with
an
already
deceased
roadkill
dog
i
wasnt
paying
very
close
attention
to
the
pavement
when
the
car
in
front
of
me
straddled
the
carcass
i
looked
down
just
in
time
to
see
what
i
was
about
to
run
over
so
i
just
held
onto
the
handlebars
and
freaked
out
both
wheels
went
squarely
over
the
dogs
belly
with
a
thumpthump
just
like
running
over
a
piece
of
a
lumber
the
bike
didnt
lose
any
stability
at
all

i
kept
on

quick
question
what
are
the
advantages

slipons
versus
your
stock
exhaust
versus
aftermarket
exhaust
systems
i
dont
see
many
people
using
slipons
but
they
are
heavily
advertised
and
half
as
expensive
thanks
dave
cost
is
lower
than
oem
replacements
and
they
weigh
less
also
in
most
instances
you
do
not
have
to
rejet
the
carburetors
to
get
a
little
more
performance
i
replaced
my
oem
canister
with
an
ontario
systems
slip
on
the
midrange
performance
is
better
but
i
also
notice
a
slight
stumble
at
rpm
after
talking
to
kaz
yoshima
the
developer
and
manufacturer
of
the
slip
on
he
thinks
i
might
need
larger
pilot
idle
jets
was
not
suppose
to
but
maybe
where
i
live
makes
a
difference
altitude
barometric
pressure
anyway
besides
that
minor
glitch
i
like
the
slip
on
performance
and
the
sound
which
is
louder
than
stock
but
not
loud
enough
to
annoy
folks
the
ontario
slip
on
use
some
sort
of
sound
baffling
technique
to
reduce
the
sound
at
full
throttle
just
remember
every
bike
is
a
tuned
system
when
you
change
the
intake
or
exhaust
characteristics
beyond
the
allowable
delta
of
the
manufacturer
you
may
have
to
change
other
areas
to
compensate
like
a
complete
change
of
the
exhaust
system
header
and
muffler
changes
the
exhaust
characteristic
to
the
point
which
rejetting
is
required
to
compensate
for
the
new
engine
breathingpumping
profile
talk
with
the
folks
who
make
the
slip

you
intend
to
use
and
ask
them
if
they
have
used
it
on
your

check
with

waiting

really
bored
looking

to
fleece
a

from

was
sitting
on

everybody
there
looked

be

you

when
some

walked

required

he
came
over
and
stood
in
line
with
me
while
we
watched
her
fill
out
some
forms

then
we
noticed
a
little
kid
about
years
old
reach
over
the
bench
and
touch
our
helmets
one
at
a
time
i
didnt
particularly
mind

neither
did
ken
that
the

was
touching
our

that
is

the
helmets
werent
on
the
most
stable
of
platforms
so
ken
scooted
over
there
to
resettle
them
and
as
soon
as
he
touched
the
helmets
mother
of

child
started
shrieking
at
her
kid
you
stay
away
from

you
shit

whopped
the

is
the

living

ive
learned
that
the
only
reliable
indicators
are
those
red
ones
which
go
on
at
both
sides
at
once
some
people
call
them
brake
lights
once
they
light
up
expect
anything
to
occur
in
front
of
you
its
not
just
the
dutch
though
however
i
never
realised
how
much
i
relied
on
this
until
i
got
caught
a
few
times
behind
someone
whose
lights
didnt
work
at
all
once
id
sussed
it
out
it
wasnt
so
bad
knowing
it
is
half
the
battle
but
its
a
great
way
to
find
out
that
youve
been
following
someone
too
closely
now
i
try
to
check
for
lights
all
the
time
cos
that
split
second
can
make
all
the
difference
though
it
shouldnt
be
necessary
i
know
owen
what
used
to
peeve
me
in
canada
was
the
cars
with
bloody
red
rear
indicators
youd
see
a
single
red
light
come
on
and
think
now
is
he
stopping
but
one
brakelamp
is
not
working
or
does
he
have
those
dumb
bloody
red
rear
indicators
this
being
survival
you
have
to
assume
hes
braking
and
take
the
appropriate
actions
until
such
time
as
the
light
goes
out
and
on
again
after
which
you
can
be
reasonably
certain
its
a
bloody
red
rear
indicator
