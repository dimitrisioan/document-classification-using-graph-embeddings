you

your

need

cases

need
not
do
as
well
as

others
in
terms

algorithm
on
the

hand
given
x
two
such
entries
we
are
more
inclined

pick
the
entry
that

does
something
interesting
when

run

x
we
try
to
avoid

such
we
leave

the

open

interpretation
as
in

life
x
programming
interpreting
a
requirements
document
or
a
customer
request
x
is
important
for
this
reason
we
often
award
worst
abuse
of
the
x
rules
to
an
entry
that
illustrates
this
point
in
an
ironic
way
x
x
if
you
do
plan

abuse

we
suggest
that
you
let
us
know
x
in

please
note
that
an
invitation

abuse
x
is
not
an
invitation

break
we
are
strict
when
it
comes
to
the
x
byte
size
limit
also
abusing
the
entry
format
tends
to
x
annoy
more
than
amuse
x
x
we
do
realize
that
there
are
holes
in
the
rules
and
invite
entries
x
to
attempt
to
exploit
them
we
will
award
worst
abuse
of
the
rules
x
and
then
plug
the
hole
next
year
even
so
we
will
attempt
to
use
x
the
smallest
plug
needed
if
not
smaller
x
x
check
out
your
program
and
be
sure
that
it
works
we
sometimes
make
x
the
effort
to
debug
an
entry
that
has
a
slight
problem
particularly
x
in
or
near
the
final
round
on
the
other
hand
we
have
seen
some
x
of
the
best
entries
fall
down
because
they
didnt
work
x
x
we
tend
to
look
down
on
a
prime
number
printer
that
claims
that
x
is
a
prime
number
if
you
do
have
a
bug
you
are
better
off
x
documenting
it
noting
this
entry
sometimes
prints
the
power
x
of
a
prime
by
mistake
would
save
the
above
entry
and
sometimes
x
a
strange
bugfeature
can
even
help
the
entry

client

we

worst
abuse
of
the
rules
x
anything
else
so
strange
that
it
deserves
an
award
x
x
we
do
not
limit
ourselves
to
this
list
for
example
a
few
entries
are
so
x
goodbad
that
they
are
declared
winners
at
the
start
of
the
final
round
x
we
will
invent
awards
categories
for
them
if
necessary
x
x
in
the
final
round
process
we
perform
the
difficult
tasks
of
x
reducing
the
remaining
entries
typically
about
down
to
or
x
winners
often
we
are
confident
that
the
entries
that
make
it
into
x
the
final
round
are
definitely
better
than
the
ones
that
do
not
x
make
it
the
selection
of
the
winners
out
of
the
final
round
is
x
less
clear
cut
x
x
sometimes
a
final
round
entry
good
enough
to
win
but
is
beat
out
x
by
a
similar
but
slightly
better
entry
for
this
reason
it
is
x
sometimes
worthwhile
to
reenter
an
improved
version
of
an
entry
x
that
failed
to
win
in
a
previous
year
this
assumes
of
course
x
that
the
entry
is
worth
improving
in
the
first
place
x
x
more
often
that
not
we
select
a
small
entry
usually
one
line
a
x
strangecreative
layout
entry
and
an
entry
that
abuses
the
contest
x
rules
in
some
way
x
x
in
the
end
we
traditionally
pick
one
entry
as
best
sometimes
such
x
an
entry
simply
far
exceeds
any
of
the
other
entry
more
often
the
x
best
is
picked
because
it

why
does
my
application
core
dump
when
i
use
signalsalarmscthreads
in
brief
xlib
xt
and
most
widget
sets
have
no
mutual
exclusion
for
critical
sections
any
interrupt
handler
is
likely
to
leave
one
of
the
above
libraries
in
an
inconsistent
state
such
as
all
the
appropriate
flags
not
yet
set
dangling
pointers
in
the
middle
of
a
list
traversal
etc
note
that
the
ansi
c
standard
points
out
that
behavior
of
a
signal
handler
is
undefined
if
the
signal
handler
calls
any
function
other
than
signal
itself
so
this
is
not
a
problem
specific
to
xlib
and
xt
the
posix
specification
mentions
other
functions
which
may
be
called
safely
but
it
may
not
be
assumed
that
these
functions
are
called
by
xlib
or
xt
functions
the
only
safe
way
to
deal
with
signals
is
to
set
a
flag
in
the
interrupt
handler
this
flag
later
needs
to
be
checked
either
by
a
work
procedure
or
a
timeout
callback
it
is
incorrect
to
add
either
of
these
in
the
interrupt
handler
as
another
note
it
is
dangerous
to
add
a
work
procedure
that
never
finishes
this
effectively
preempts
any
work
procedures
previously
added
and
so
they
will
never
be
called
another
option
is
to
open
a
pipe
tell
the
event
loop
about
the
read
end
using
xtappaddinput
and
then
the
signal
handler
can
write
a
byte
to
the
write
end
of
the
pipe
for
each
signal
however
this
could
deadlock
your
process
if
the
pipe
fills
up
why
dont
the
intrinsics
deal
with
this
problem
primarily
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
portable
layer
to
any
hardware
and
operating
system
is
that
a
good
enough
reason
i
dont
think
so
note
the
article
in
the
x
journal
and
the
example
in
oreilly
volume
are
in
error
how
do
i
use
a
different
visual
than
the
default
this
requires
a
more
complicated
answer
than
it
should
a
window
has
three
things
that
are
visual
specific
the
visual
colormap
and
border
pixmap
all
widgets
have
their
own
colormap
and
borderpixmap
resource
only
shell
widgets
have
visual
resources
another
questions
deals
with
why
shells
have
a
visual
the
default
value
of
these
resources
is
copyfromparent
which
does
exactly
what
it
says
in
the
shell
widget
copyfromparent
gets
evalulated
as
defaultvisualofscreen
and
defaultcolormapofscreen
when
any
one
of
the
three
resources
is
not
properly
set
a
badmatch
error
occurs
when
the
window
is
created
they
are
not
properly
set
because
each
of
the
values
depends
on
the
visual
being
used
how
to
get
this
to
work
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer
the
first
is
if
you
want
an
application
to
start
with
a
particular
visual
and
the
second
is
if
you
want
a
particular
shell
within
an
application
to
start
with
a
different
visual
the
second
is
actually
easier
because
the
basic
information
you
need
is
available
the
first
is
a
little
harder
because
youll
need
to
initialize
much
of
the
toolkit
yourself
in
order
to
determine
the
needed
information
some
sample
code
to
start
up

return
which
visual
should
an
application
use
this
is
a
point
that
can
be
argued
about
but
one
opinion
is
there
is
no
way
for
an
application
to
know
the
appropriate
visual
it
has
to
be
specified
by
the
user
if
you
disagree
with
this
then
your
application
probably
falls
into
the
category
of
always
using
the
default
visual
or
it
is
hardware
specific
and
expects
some
particular
visual
such
as
truecolor
with
an
overlayplane
extension
or
some
such
why
no
application
runs
in
isolation
depending
on
the
way
a
server
allocates
resources
i
may
not
always
want
your
application
to
run
in
truecolor
mode
if
it
is
going
to
mess
up
my
other
applications
i
may
be
very
upset
if
it
chooses
to
run
in
greyscale
instead
of
psuedocolor
or
just
monochrome
as
an
example
on
a
low
end
color
sun
server
there
are
many
different
possible
visuals
monochrome
entry
colormap
static
gray
static
color
and
a
truecolor
the
sgi
iriss
offer
all
the
above
plus
bit
truecolor
bit

why
do
only
shell
widgets
have
a
visual
this
is
strictly
by
convention
it
makes
it
possible
for
an
arbitrary
widget
to
know
that
the
visual
it
uses
can
be
found
by
looking
for
the
shell
widget
that
is
its
ancestor
and
obtaining
the
visual
of
that
shell
a
widget
can
have
its
own
visual
resource
if
it
does
it
must
have
its
own
realize
method
to
use
the
visual
when
it
calls
xcreatewindow
you
should
also
make
this
a
resource
that
can
be
obtained
with
xtgetvalues
so
other
widgets
can
find
it
a
reasonable
value
is
probably
xtnvisual
which
visual
depth
and
colormap
do
shells
inherit
the
default
value
for
these
resources
are
set
to
copyfromparent
this
is
interpreted
as
the
defaultcolormapofscreen
defaultdepthofscreen
and
the
default
visual
of
the
screen
if
the
widget
has
no
parent
ie
it
is
an
applicationshellwidgetclass
and
the
root
of
your
widget
tree
if
the
parent
of
the
widget
is
not
null
then
the
shell
copies
colormap
and
depth
from
its
parent
and
uses
copyfromparent
as
the
visual
ive
done
all
the
above
and
i
still
get
a
badmatch
error
why
some
resource
converters
improperly
cache
references
this
was
especially
true
of
and
earlier
versions
of
motif
why
doesnt
my
widget
get
destroyed
when
i
call
xtdestroywidget
see
section
of
the
xt
specification
it
eventually
does
get
destroyed
just
not
immediately
the
intrinsics
destroy
a
widget
in
a
twophase
process
first
it
and
all
of
its
children
have
a
flag
set
that
indicate
it
is
being
destroyed
it
is
then
put
on
a
list
of
widgets
to
be
destroyed
this
way
any
pending
x
events
or
further
references
to
that
widget
can
be
cleaned
up
before
the
memory
is
actually
freed
the
second
phase
is
then
performed
after
all
callbacks
event
handlers
and
actions
have
completed
before
checking
for
the
next
x
event
at
this
point
the
list
is
traversed
and
each
widgets
memory
is
actually
freed
among
other
things
as
some
further
caveatstrivia
the
widgets
may
be
destroyed
if
the
intrinsics
determine
that
they
have
no
further
references
to
the
widgets
on
the
list
if
so
then
the
phase
destruction
occurs
immediately
also
if
nested
event
loops
are
used
widgets
placed
on
the
destroy
list
before
entering
the
inner
event
loop
are
not
destroyed
until
returning
to
the
outer
event
loop
how
do
i
exit
but
still
execute
the
destroycallbacks
the
problem
is
if
a
simple
and
entirely
reasonable
approach
to
exiting
an
application
is
used
such
as
calling
exit
directly
then
a
widget
may
not
have
a
chance
to
clean
up
any
external
state
such
as
open
sockets
temporary
files
allocated
x
resources
etc
this
code
for
simplicity
reasons
assumes
only
a
single
toplevel
widget

exit
one
can
see
that
the
above
code
exits
immediately
after
destroying
the
toplevel
widget
the
trouble
is
the
phase
destruction
may
never
occur
this
works
for
most
widgets
and
most
applications
but
will
not
work
for
those
widgets
that
have
any
external
state
you
might
think
that
since
it
works
now
it
will
always
work
but
remember
that
part
of
the
reason
an
object
oriented
approach
is
used
is
so
one
can
be
ignorant
of
the
implementation
details
for
each
widget
which
means
that
the
widget
may
change
and
someday
require
that
some
external
state
is
cleaned
up
by
the
destroy
callbacks
one
alternative
is
to
modify
exitcallback
to
set
a
global
flag
and
then
test
for
that
flag
in
a
private
event
loop
however
private
event
loops
are
frowned
upon
because
it
tends
to
encourage
sloppy
and
difficult
to
maintain
practices

how
do
i
resize
a
shell
widget
after
it
is
realized
one
doesnt
resize
a
shell
widget
the
proper
thing
is
to
resize
the
currently
managed
child
of
the
shell
widget
using
xtsetvalues
the
geometry
change
is
then
propagated
to
the
shell
which
asks
the
window
manager
which
may
or
may
not
allow
the
request
however
the
shell
must
have
the
resource
xtnallowshellresize
set
to
true
otherwise
it
will
not
even
ask
the
window
manager
to
grant
the
request
and
the
shell
will
not
resize
to
change
the
position
of
a
shell
use
xtsetvalues
on
the
shell
not
the
child
and
within
the
limits
of
the
window
manager
it
should
be
granted
why
cant
xtappaddinput
handle
files
it
does
however
unix
semantics
for
when
io
is
ready
for
a
file
does
not
fit
most
peoples
intuitive
model
in
unix
terms
a
file
descriptor
is
ready
for
reading
whenever
the
read
call
would
not
block
ignoring
the
setting
of
optional
flags
that
indicate
not
to
block
this
works
as
expected
for
terminals
sockets
and
pipes
for
a
file
the
read
will
always
return
but
the
return
indicates
an
eof
ie
no
more
data
the
result
is
the
code
in
the
intrinsics
always
calls
the
input
handler
because
it
always
thinks
something
is
about
to
be
read
the
culprit
is
the
select
system
call
or
on
sysv
based
oss
it
is
the
poll
system
call
how
to
get
around
this
on
a
unix
system
the
best
approach
is
to
use
another
process
to
check
for
available
input
on
the
file
use
a
pipe
to
connect
the
application
with
this
other
process
and
pass
the
file
descriptor
from
the
pipe
to
xtappaddinput
a
suitable
program
on
bsd
systems
is
tail
f
filename
its
rumored
that
select
on
some
systems
is
not
completely
reliable
in
particular
ibm
aix
this
is
one
where
it
would
work
for
a
while
several
thousand
times
and
then
stop
until
some
other
event
woke
it
up
this
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
a
race
condition
in
the
kernel
ibm
claims
to
have
a
fix
for
this
pyramid
doesnt
work
at
all
ultrix
and
possibly
others
where
pipes
are
implemented
as
sockets
wasnt
completely
broken
but
although
the
writing
side
wrote
in
byte
blocks
the
reading
side
received
it
all
broken
up
as
if
it
was
being
put
into
the
pipe
a
byte
at
a
time
you
can
waste
a
lot
of
time
by
reading
small
blocks
get
raound
it
by
detecting
the
situation
and
having
select
ignore
the
pipe
for
mseconds
by
then
it
had
been
given
the
whole
block
note
that
all
the
above
descriptions
used
unix
terminology
such
as
read
file
descriptor
pipes
etc
this
is
an
os
dependent
area
and
may
not
be
identical
on
all
systems
however
the
intrinsic
designers
felt
it
was
a
common
enough
operation
that
it
should
be
included
with
part
of
the
toolkit
why
they
didnt
also
deal
with
signals
at
this
point

however
much
i

implementing

hopefully
some
alternative
will
develop
in
the
next

that
uses
an
object

language
keep
your
eyes
open
and
expect
some
change
about
the
same
time
a
language
other
than
c
starts
gaining
acceptance
how
do
i
pass
a
float
value
to
xtsetvalues
first
what
is
going
wrong
is
the
structure
for
an
arg
is
essentially
typdef
struct
string
name
long
value
arg
and
the
code
arg
arg
xtsetarg
arg
name
expands
to
arg
arg
argname
name
argvalue
you
can
see
that
with
normal
c
type
conversions
the
argvalue
gets
the
integer
instead
of
the
floating
point
value
when
the
value
is
copied
into
the
widget
resource
the
bit
pattern
is
wildly
different
than
that
required
for
a
floating

value
so
how
to
get
around
this

resource
converter

the
following
discussion
of
resource
converters
assumes
or
intrinsics
resource
converters
changed
between
and
to
allow
for
destructors
and
caching
of
converted
values
there
are
several
main
types
of
resource
converters
string
to
data
type
data
type
to
string
data
type
to
data
type
i
string
to
data
type
usually
a
string
to
data
type
converter
has
a
fixed
set
of
strings
that
will
be
converted
to
data
type
values
this
is
most
often
used
to
map
enumerated
names
to
enumerated
values
name
value
true
false
in
this
case
the
string
to
data
type
converter
needs
to
compare
the
resource
value
to
the
list
of
fixed
strings
this
is
most
readily
accomplished
by
the
use
of
the
quark
mechanism
of
the
resource
manager
the
resource
value
is
turned
into
a
quark
which
is
a
unique
representation
of
the
string
that
fits
into
a
single
word
then
the
resource
quark
is
compared
against
the
quarks
for
the
fixed
strings
representing
the
enumerated
values
if
there
are
many
enumerated
strings
in
the
converter
or
many
converters
each
with
a
small
number
of
enumeration
strings
then
a
global
initialization
routine
might
be
used
to
turn
all
the
resource
strings
into
quarks
that
way
the
first
time
one
of
these
converters
is
used
the
strings
will
be
turned
into
quarks
and
held
in
static
variables
for
use
in
the
next
invocation
of
one
of
the
converters
ii
data
type
to
string
this
type
of
converter
is
slightly
easier
than
the
string
to
data
type
converters
since
the
use
of
quarks
isnt
necessary
instead
the
data
type
value
is
simply
converted
to
a
string
value
probably
by
the
use
of
sprintf
data
type
to
string
converters
are
useful
for
applications
that
wish
to
convert
an
internal
data
type
value
into
a
string
so
that
they
can
write
out
a
valid
resource
specification
to
a
file
this
mechanism
can
be
used
to
provide
a
snapshot
of
application
state
into
a
file
this
snapshot
can
be
used
to
restore
the
program
to
a
known
state
via
the
usual
x
resource
database
mechanisms
if
you
are
taking
the
trouble
to
write
a
string
to
data
type
converter
it
isnt
much
extra
effort
to
write
the
data
type
to
string
converter
writing
both
at
the
same
time
helps
to
ensure
that
they
are
consistent
iii
data
type
to
data
type
this
type
of
converter
is
used
to
convert
an
existing
data
type
value
to
another
data
type
for
instance
an
x
pixel
value
can
be
converted
to
an
rgb
data
type
that
contains
separate
fields
for
red
green
and
blue
the
type
signature
for
a
resource
converter
is
as
follows
typedef
boolean
xttypeconverterdisplay
xrmvalueptr
cardinal
xrmvalueptr
xrmvalueptr
xtpointer
display
dpy
xrmvalueptr
args
cardinal
numargs
xrmvalueptr
fromval
xrmvalueptr
toval
xtpointer
converterdata
when
the
converter
is
invoked
the
fromval
argument
points
to
the
source
x
resource
manager
value
and
the
toval
argument
points
to
the
destination
x
resource
manager
value
the
converterdata
argument
is
an
opaque
pointer
to
some
converterspecific
data
that
is
specified
when
the
converter
is
registered
the
args
and
numargs
arguments
allow
extra
information
to
be
passed
to
the
converter
when
it
is
invoked
for
instance
the
pixel
to
rgb
structure
converter
discussed
above
would
need
colormap
and
visual
arguments
in
which
to
lookup
the
pixel
to
obtain
the
rgb
values
corresponding
to
that
pixel
care
must
be
taken
with
the
toval
argument
an
xrmvalue
has
the
following
type
definition
and
specifies
a
size
and
location
for
a
converted
value
typedef
struct
unsigned
int
size
caddrt
addr
xrmvalue
xrmvalueptr
when
the
converter
is
invoked
the
address
may
point
to
a
location
of
the
given
size
for
the
converted
value
or
the
location
can
be
null
in
the
former
case
the
converter
should
ensure
that
the
size
of
the
destination
area
is
large
enough
to
handle
the
converted
value
if
the
destination
area
is
not
large
enough
then
the
converter
should
set
the
size
to
the
amount
of
space
needed
and
return
false
the
caller
can
then
ensure
that
enough
space
is
allocated
and
reinvoke
the
converter
if
the
size
is
large
enough
then
the
converter
can
simply
copy
the
converted
value
into
the
space
given
and
return
true
if
the
location
is
null
then
the
converter
can
assign
the
location
to
the
address
of
a
static
variable
containing
the
converted
value
and
return
true
when
writing
a
group
of
converters
this
code
is
often
repeated
and
it
becomes
convenient
to
define
a
macro
define
donevar
type
if
tovaladdr
if
tovalsize
sizeoftype
tovalsize
sizeoftype
return
false
else
type
tovaladdr
var
else
tovaladdr
caddrt
var
tovalsize
sizeoftype
return
true
define
donestrstr
if
tovaladdr
tovalsize
sizeofstring
tovalsize
sizeofstring
return
false
else
tovaladdr
caddrt
str
tovalsize
sizeofstring
return
true
inside
the
converter
it
is
a
good
idea
to
perform
a
little
safety
checking
on
the
numargs
and
args
arguments
to
ensure
that
your
converter
is
being
called
properly
once
you
have
written
your
converter
you
need
to
register
it
with
the
intrinsics
the
intrinsics
invokes
resource
converters
when
creating
widgets
and
fetching
their
resource
values
from
the
resource
database
to
register
a
converter
with
a
single
application
context
use
xtappsettypeconverter
void
xtappsettypeconvertercontext
from
to
converter
args
numargs
cache
destructor
xtappcontext
context
string
from
string
to
xttypeconverter
converter
xtconvertarglist
args
cardinal
numargs
xtcachetype
cache
xtdestructor
destructor
to
register
a
converter
with
all
application
contexts
use
xtsettypeconverter
void
xtsettypeconverterfrom
to
converter
args
numargs
cache
destructor
string
from
string
to
xttypeconverter
converter
xtconvertarglist
args
cardinal
numargs
xtcachetype
cache
xtdestructor
destructor
in
the
intrinsics
there
were
the
routines
xtappaddconverter
and
xtaddconverter
these
have
been
superseded
by
xtappsettypeconverter
and
xtsettypeconverter
whenever
possible
the
newer
routines
should
be
used
when
a
converter
is
registered
with
the
intrinsics
a
cache
argument
specifies
how
converted
resource
values
are
to
be
cached
xtcachenone
dont
cache
any
converted
values
xtcacheall
cache
all
converted
values
xtcachebydisplay
cache
converted
values
on
a
per
display
basis
caching
converted
values
that
require
a
roundtrip
to
the
server
is
a
good
idea
for
instance
string
to
pixel
conversions
the
destructor
argument
is
a
routine
that
is
invoked
then
the
resource
is
destroyed
either
because
its
cached
reference
count
has
been
decremented
to
zero
or
because
the
widget
owning
the
value
is
being
destroyed
xtdestructor
has
the
following
type
definition
typedef
void
xtdestructorxtappcontext
xrmvalueptr
xtpointer
xrmvalueptr
cardinal
xtappcontext
context
xrmvalueptr
to
xtpointer
converterdata
xrmvalueptr
args
cardinal
numargs
the
destructor
is
invoked
to
free
any
auxiliary
storage
associated
with
the
to
argument
but
does
not
actually
free
the
storage
pointed
to
by
the
to
argument
itself
toaddr
the
destructor
is
passed
the
extra
arguments
that
were
passed
to
the
converter
when
the
conversion
was
performed
for
instance
colormap
and
visual
arguments
for
the
string
to
pixel
converter
since
the
destructor
would
need
to
free
the
allocated
pixel
from
the
colormap
as
well
as
the
private
data
passed
in
when
the
converter
was
registered

the

resource
issue
summer
by
oliver
jones
for
a
complete
coverage
of
the
issues
involved
most
of
this
answer
is
based
on
that
article
in
a
nutshell
one
uses
xtopendisplay
to
add
each
display
to
a
single
application
context
and
then
xtclosedisplay
to
shutdown
each
display
and
remove
it
from
the
application
context
the
real
problems
occur
when
trying
to
close
down
a
display
this
can
happen
ways
user
selects
a
quit
button
on
one
of
the
displays
user
has
window
manager
send
a
wmdeletewindow
message
server
disconnect
possibly
from
a
killclient
message
server
shutdowncrash
or
network
failure
ill
assume
you
can
deal
gracefully
with
since
it
is
merely
a
problem
of
translating
a
widget
to
a
display
and
removing
that
display
if
not
then
read
the
oliver
jones
article
the
third
one
is
difficult
to
handle
the
following
is
based
on
the
oliver
jones
article
and
i
include
it
here
because
it
is
a
difficult
problem
the
difficulty
arises
because
the
xlib
design
presumed
that
an
io
error
is
always
unrecoverable
and
so
fatal
this
is
essentially
true
for
a
single
display
x
based
application
but
not
true
for
a
multiple
display
program
or
an
application
that
does
things
other
than
display
information
on
an
x
server
when
an
x
io
error
occurs
the
io
error
handler
is
called
and
if
it
returns
then
an
exit
happens
the
only
way
around
this
is
to
use
setjmplongjmp
to
avoid
returning
to
the
io
error
handler
the
following
code
fragment
demonstrates
this
include
setjmph
jmpbuf
xiorecover
void
xiohandler
dpy
display
dpy
destroydisplay
dpy
longjmp
xiorecover
main
if
setjmp
xiorecover
xsetioerrorhandler
xiohandler
xtappmainloop
appcontext
the
destroydisplay
is
something
that
given
a
display
pointer
can
go
back
to
the
application
specific
data
and
perform
any
necessary
cleanup
it
should
also
call
xtclosedisplay
for
those
of
you
unfamiliar
with
setjmplongjmp
when
setjmp
is
first
called
it
returns
a
and
saves
enough
information
in
the
jmpbuf
that
a
latter
execution
of
longjmp
can
return
the
program
to
the
same
state
as
if
the
setjmp
was
just
executed
the
return
value
of
this
second
setjmp
is
the
value
of
the
second
argument
to
longjmp
there
are
several
caveats
about
using
these
but
for
this
purpose
it
is
adequate
some
other
problems
you
might
run
into
are
resource
converters
that
improperly
cache
resources
the
most
likely
symptoms
are
xlib
errors
such
as
badcolor
badatom
or
badfont
there
may
be
problems
with
the
total
number
of
displays
you
can
open
since
typically
only
a
limited
number
of
file
descriptors
are
available
with
being
a
typical
value
you
may
also
run
into
authorization
problems
when
trying
to
connect
to
a
display
there
was
much
discussion
in
compwindowsx
about
this
topic
in
november
of
robert
scheifler
posted
an
article
which
basically
said
this
is
the
way
it
will
be
and
xlib
will
not
change
what
changed
from
to
to
this
addresses
only
changes
in
the
intrinsics
first
the
general
changes
for
each

are
described
then
a

thanks

for
the
following
you
can
use
several
environment
variables
to
control
how
resources
are
loaded
for
your
xtbased
programs
xfilesearchpath
xuserfilesearchpath
and
xapplresdir
these
environment
variables
control
where
xt
looks
for
applicationdefaults
files
as
an
application
is
initializing
xt
loads
at
most
one
appdefaults
file
from
the
path
defined
in
xfilesearchpath
and
another
from
the
path
defined
in
xuserfilesearchpath
set
xfilesearchpath
if
software
is
installed
on
your
system
in
such
a
way
that
appdefaults
files
appear
in
several
different
directory
hierarchies
suppose
for
example
that
you
are
running
suns
open
windows
and
you
also
have
some
x
applications
installed
in
you
could
set
a
value
like
this
for
xfilesearchpath
and
it
would
cause
xt
to
look
up
appdefaults
files
in
both
and
usropenwinlib
or
wherever
your
openwinhome
is
located
setenv
xfilesearchpath
the
value
of
this
environment
variable
is
a
colonseparated
list
of
pathnames
the
pathnames
contain
replacement
characters
as
follows
see
xtresolvepathname
n
the
value
of
the
filename
parameter
or
the
applications
class
name
t
the
value
of
the
file
type
in
this
case
the
literal
string
appdefaults
c
customization
resource
only
s
suffix
none
for
appdefaults
l
language
locale
and
codeset
eg
jajpeuc
l
language
part
of
l
eg
ja
t
the
territory
part
of
the
displays
language
string
c
the
codeset
part
of
the
displays
language
string
lets
take
apart
the
example
suppose
the
applications
class
name
is
myterm
also
suppose
open
windows
is
installed
in
usropenwin
notice
the
example
omits
localespecific
lookup
means
openwinhomelibtn
means
usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm
as
the
application
initializes
xt
tries
to
open
both
of
the
above
appdefaults
files
in
the
order
shown
as
soon
as
it
finds
one
it
reads
it
and
uses
it
and
stops
looking
for
others
the
effect
of
this
path
is
to
search
first
in
then
in
usropenwin
lets
consider
another
example
this
time
lets
set
xuserfilesearchpath
so
it
looks
for
the
file
mytermad
in
the
current
working
directory
then
for
myterm
in
the
directory
appdefaults
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
nadhomeappdefaultsn
the
first
path
in
the
list
expands
to
mytermad
the
second
expands
to
homeappdefaultsmyterm
this
is
a
convenient
setting
for
debugging
because
it
follows
the
imake
convention
of
naming
the
appdefaults
file
mytermad
in
the
applications
source
directory
so
you
can
run
the
application
from
the
directory
in
which
you
are
working
and
still
have
the
resources
loaded
properly
note
when
looking
for
appdefault
files
with
xuserfilesearchpath
for
some
bizarre
reason
neither
the
type
nor
file
suffix
is
defined
so
t
and
s
are
useless
with
theres
another
twist
you
may
specify
a
customization
resource
value
for
example
you
might
run
the
myterm
application
like
this
myterm
xrm
customization
color
if
one
of
your
pathname
specifications
had
the
value
then
the
expanded
pathname
would
be
because
the
c
substitution
character
takes
on
the
value
of
the
customization
resource
the
default
xfilesearchpath
compiled
into
xt
is
note
some
sites
replace
with
a
projectroot
in
this
batch
of
default
settings
the
default
xuserfilesearchpath
also
compiled
into
xt
is
rootlnc
rootlnc
rootnc
rootln
rootln
rootn
root
is
either
the
value
of
xapplresdir
or
the
users
home
directory
if
xapplresdir
is
not
set
if
you
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
some
value
other
than
the
default
xt
ignores
xapplresdir
altogether
notice
that
the
quick
and
dirty
way
of
making
your
application
find
your
appdefaults
file
in
your
current
working
directory
is
to
set
xapplresdir
to
a
single
dot
in
all
this
machinery
worked
differently
for
compatibilty
many
people
set
their
xapplresdir
value
to
a
dot
followed
by
a
slash
what
order
are
callbacks
executed
in
courtesy
of
donna
converse
converseexpolcsmitedu
the
intrinsics
library
do
not
guarantee
an
order
this
is
because
both
the
widget
writer
and
the
application
writer
have
the
ability
to
modify
the
entire
contents
of
the
callback
list
neither
one
currently
knows
what
the
other
is
doing
and
so
the
intrinsics
cannot
guarantee
the
order
of
execution
the
application
programmer
cannot
rely
on
the
widget
writer
the
widget
writer
is
not
required
to
document
when
the
widget
will
add
and
remove
callbacks
from
the
list
or
what
effect
this
will
have
therefore
the
functionality
contained
in
a
callback
should
be
independent
of
the
functionality
contained
in
other
callbacks
on
the
list
even
though
the
xt
standard
in
the
definition
of
xtaddcallback
says
callbackname
specifies
the
callback
list
to
which
the
procedure
is
to
be
appended
you
may
not
infer
from
the
word
appended
that
the
callback
routines
are
called
in
the
same
order
as
they
have
been
added
to
the
callback
list
how
do
i

if
a

is

courtesy
of
donna
converse
converseexpolcsmitedu
i
am
building
a
widget
needs
to
know
if
it
is
visible
i
set
the
visible
interest
field
in
core
and
if
my
window
is
completely
obscured
the
core
visible
flag
goes
false
however
if
my
window
is
iconified
the
flag
stays
set
to
true
right
everything
is
implemented
correctly
this
demonstrates
a
deficiency
in
the
x
protocol
and
the
core
widget
is
reflecting
the
capabilities
of
the
protocol
the
deficiency
is
that
the
information
is
available
in
one
way
in
this
case
an
inconvenient
way
the
xt
specification
is
accurate
in
the
second
and
third
paragraphs
of
section
so
read
this
section
carefully
the
visible
field
will
not
change
in
response
to
iconification
a
visibilitynotify
event
will
not
be
received
when
the
window
goes
from
viewable
to
unviewable
that
is
when
the
widget
or
an
ancestor
is
unmapped
that
is
when
iconification
occurs
this
is
the
protocol
deficiency
visibility
state
and
viewable
state
have
specific
meanings
in
the
x
protocol
see
the
glossary
in
your
xlib
and
x
protocol
reference
manual
is
this
a
problem
with
mwm
or
is
there
something
else
which
needs
to
be
done
youll
see
this
with
any
window
manager
with
no
window
manager
if
the
problem
is
mwm
what
is
the
fastest
way
to
determine
if
a
window
is
iconified
as
an
application
writer
keep
track
with
a
global
boolean
in
an
action
routine
with
translations
for
mapnotify
and
unmapnotify
on
the
shell
widget
which
contains
your
custom
widget
as
the
custom
widget
writer
see
the
mapstate
field
returned
by
a
call
to
xgetwindowattributes
these
are
suggestions
how
do
i
reparent
a
widget
in
xt
ie
xtreparentwidget
you
cant
why
use
xtmalloc
xtfree
etc
unfortunately
most
code
that
calls
malloc
realloc
or
calloc
tends
to
ignore
the
possibility
of
returning
null
at
best
it
is
handled
something
like
ptr
type
malloc
sizeof
type
if
ptr
perror
malloc
in
xyzzy
exit
to
handle
this
common
case
the
intrinsics
define
the
functions
xtmalloc
xtcalloc
xtnew
xtnewstring
and
xtrealloc
which
all
use
the
standard
c
language
functions
malloc
calloc
and
realloc
but
execute
xterrormsg
if
a
null
value
is
returned
xt
error
handlers
are
not
supposed
to
return
so
this
effectively
exits
in
addition
if
xtrealloc
is
called
with
a
null
pointer
it
uses
xtmalloc
to
get
the
initial
space
this
allows
code
like
if
ptr
ptr
type
malloc
sizeof
type
else
ptr
type
realloc
ptr
sizeof
type
count
count
to
be
written
as
ptr
xtrealloc
ptr
sizeof
ptr
count
also
xtfree
accepts
a
null
pointer
as
an
argument
generally
ive
found
the
xt
functions
conveniant
to
use
however
anytime
im
allocating
anything
potentially
large
i
use
the
standard
functions
so
i
can
fully
recover
from
not
enough

a
strict
interpretation
of
the
intrinsics
reference
manual
allow
an
implementation
to
provide
functions
that
are
not
exchangable
with
malloc
and
free
ie
code
such
as
char
ptr
ptr
xtmalloc
free

may
not
work
personally
id
call
any
implementation
that
did
this
broken
and
complain
to
the
vendor
a
common
error
for
motif
programmers
is
to
use
xtfree
on
a
string
when
they
should
really
be
using
xmstringfree

software
this
is
a
great
package
for
tracing

on

its
a
bit
pricey
at
but
id
still
recomend
it
excuse
the
marketing
blurb
contact
supportpurecom
for
more
info
purify
inserts
additional
checking
instructions
directly
into
the
object
code
produced
by
existing
compilers
these
instructions
check
every
memory
read
and
write
performed
by
the
program
under
test
and
detect
several
types
of
access
errors
such
as
reading
unitialized
memory
writing
past
mallocd
bounds
or
writing
to
freed
memory
purify
inserts
checking
logic
into
all
of
the
code
in
a
program
including
third
party
and
vendor
objectcode
libraries
and
verifies
system
call
interfaces
in

purify
tracks
memory
usage
and
identifies
individual

adaption
of

techniques
purifys
nearly
comprehensive
memory
access

an
alternative

that
isnt
as

runs

has
pretty
similar
features
is

next
if
you
are
getting
any
sort
of
xlib
error
youll
need
to
run
in
synchronous
mode
easily
accomplished
with
the
sync
command
line
argument
or
by
setting
the
variable
xdebug
to
with
your
debugger
then
set
a
break
point
in
exit
this
will
let
you
trace
back
to
the
original
xlib
function
being
called
if
you
dont
run
in
synchronous
mode
then
the
actual
error
may
have
occured
any
number
of
calls
to
xlib
previously
since
the
xlib
calls
are
buffered
and
replies
from
the
server
are
asynchronous
next
if
you
are
having
trouble
with
window
layout
you
can
use
the
undocumented
resource
xtidentifywindows
or
the
class
resource
xtdebug
to
cause
the
widget
name
to
be
identified
with
each
window
for
example
example
xload
xrm
xtdebugtrue
example
xwininfo
tree
click
in
new
xload
window
will
give
the
normal
information
but
the
widget
name
and
class
of
each
window
is
included
this
can
help
for
checking
the
location
and
size
of
errant
widgets
next
if
you
are
having
trouble
with
geometry
managers
or
you
want
to
test
the
way
a
widget
manages
its
children
you
can
try
exportlcsmiteducontriblibxtgeotarz
this
acts
as
a
filter
between
any
children
and
a
geometry
manager
and
checks
the
behaviour
of
both
its
a
very
clever
idea
the
most
unfortunate
problem
is
debugging
a
callback
while
the
application
is
executing
a
grab
of
the
keyboard
or
mouse
such
as
from
a
pulldown
menu
the
server
effectively
locks
up
and
youll
need
to
go
to
another
machine
and
kill
the
debugger
manually
the
server
locks
up
because
the
application
being
debugged
has
said
no
one
else
can
have
access
to
the
keyboard
but
the
application
is
not
stopped
waiting
because
the
debugger
is
waiting
for
your
commands
unfortunately
you
cant
give
them
because
all
the
input
is
going
to
your
application
which
is
stopped
the
best
way
to
debug
this
kind
of
problem
is
with
two
machines
on
your
desk
running
the
program
under
a
debugger
or
other
environment
on
one
machine
and
running
the
application
on
the
other
possibly
using
a
command
sequence
like
this
othermachine
xhost
thismachine
thismachine
setenv
display
thismachine
gdb
application
your
favorite
debugger
or
this

i
believe
codecenter
a
c
interpretergraphical
debugger
has
a
method
of
dealing
with
this
by
explicitely
calling
the
xlib
functions
to
release
any
grabs
during
breakpoints
debugging
widget
problems
requires
pretty
good
debugging
skills
and
knowledge
of
how
widgets
work
you
can
go
a
long
way
without
knowing
the
internals
of
a
particular
widget
but
not
very
far
without
understanding
how
a
widget
works
judicious
use
of
conditional
breakpoints
and
adding
print
statements
with
the
debugger
help
a
great
deal
why
dont
xtaddinput
xtaddtimeout
and
xtaddworkproc
work
i
have
got
a
delicate
problem
with
the
three
routines
xtaddinput
xtaddtimeout
and
xtaddworkproc
the
problem
i
have
is
that
when
i
use
them
in
my
application
they
seem
not
to
be
registred
properly
i
have
made
a
handy
little
testprogram
where
everything
works
perfect
but
in
my
real
application
nothing
happens
the
introduction
in
of
the
xtapp
functions
obsoleted
those
routines
see
for
other
changes
in
and
what
happens
is
they
use
a
default
application
context
different
then
the
one
you
may
have
created
since
events
and
timeouts
are
distributed
on
a
per
application
context
basis
and
you
are
using
two
application
contexts
you
wont
get
those
events
for
example
cnt
toplevel
xtappinitializeapp
class
desc
xtnumber
desc
argc
argv
fallback
args
cnt
xtaddtimeout
xtaddworkproc
xtappmainloop
app
would
never

my

better

also
there
seem
to
be

then
is
to
use
the

for

your

code
and
then
use
c
for
you
application
code
i
should
tell
you
that
there
is
some
real
neat
stuff
coming
out
of
teleuse
soon
in
regard
to
c
but
i
cant
give
you
many
details
you
should
talk
to
your
local
sales
rep
and
get
the
lowdown
on
what
they
will
be
doing
in
the
near
furture
if
you
want
example
code
of
how
c
integrates
with

strange
exposure
problem
hi
im
trying
to
write
a
motif
program
on
an
interactive
unix
machine
and
im
observing
very
strange
behavior
when
my
program
attempts
to
expose
a
drawingarea
namely
some
xlib
operations
work
and
some
do
not
in
particular
the
expose
consist
of
two
xfillrectangle
calls
followed
by
some
xdrawpoint
calls
and
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
the
point
calls
are
failing
whenever
a
pulldown
or
popup
up
menu
is
clicked
on
and
moved
in
the
rightward
direction
over
the
drawing
area
but
after
the
move
is
still
on
some
part
of
the
drawing
area
this
also
happens
less
consistently
when
the
pulldownpopup
is
moved
in
the
leftward
direction
assuming
that
my
code
is
not
doing
anything
incredibly
odd
is
this
a
server
bug
thanks

preferably
with

sometimes
make

the

debug

a
slight
problem

in

you
are
better
off

x
the

another
to

you

we

do

impact

your

size
up

we
want
to
get

away

x
x
given
two
versions

one
that

a
compact
blob
x
of

the

more

the

a

version

we

we

x
the

process
helps

biased

we
are
usually
kept
in

as
much
as
you

until

we
like
the
surprise
of

out
in

who
won

where
they
were
from
x
x
we
attempt
to
keep
all
entries
anonymous
unless
they
win
an
award
x
because
the
main
prize
of
winning
is
being
announced
we
make
all
x
attempts
to
send
nonwinners
into
oblivion
we
remove
all
nonwinning
x
files
and
shred
all
related
paper
by
tradition
we
do
not
even
x
reveal
the
number
of
entries
that
we
received
for
the
curious
x
we
do
indicate
the
volume
of
paper
consumed
when
presenting
the
ioccc
x
winners
at
talks
x
x
after
the
usenix
announcement
we
attempt
to
send
email
to
the
x
authors
of
the
winning
entries
one
reason
we
do
this
is
to
give
x
the
authors
a
chance
to
comment
on
the
way
we
have
presented
their
x
entry
they
are
given
the

we

often
accept

about
our
remarks
as
well
x
this
is
done
prior

the
winners
to
the
wide
world
x
x
judging
consists
of
a
number
of
elimination
rounds
during
a
round
x
the
collection
of
entries
are
divided
into
two
roughly
equal
piles
x
the
pile
that
advances
on
to
the
next
round
and
the
pile
that
does
x
not
we
also
reexamine
the
entries
that
were
eliminated
in
the
x
previous
round
thus
an
entry
gets
at
least
two
readings
x
x
a
reading
consists
of
a
number
of
actions
x
x
reading

x
we
do

ourselves
to

a
few
entries
are
so

goodbad
that
they
are
declared
winners
at
the
start

round
x
we
will
invent

categories
for

if
necessary
x
x
in
the
final
round
process
we
perform
the
difficult
tasks
of
x
reducing
the
remaining
entries
typically
about
down
to
or
x
winners
often
we
are
confident
that
the
entries
that
make
it
into
x
the
final
round
are
definitely
better
than
the
ones
that
do
not
x
make
it
the
selection
of
the
winners
out
of
the
final
round
is
x
less
clear
cut
x
x
sometimes
a
final
round
entry
good
enough
to
win
but
is
beat
out
x
by
a
similar
but
slightly
better
entry
for
this
reason
it
is
x
sometimes
worthwhile
to
reenter
an
improved
version
of
an
entry
x
that
failed
to
win
in
a
previous
year
this
assumes
of
course
x
that
the
entry
is
worth
improving
in
the
first
place
x
x
more
often
that
not
we
select
a
small
entry
usually
one
line
a
x
strangecreative
layout
entry
and
an
entry
that
abuses
the
contest
x
rules
in
some
way
x
x
in
the
end
we
traditionally
pick
one
entry
as
best
sometimes
such
x
an
entry
simply
far
exceeds
any
of
the
other
entry
more
often
the

is
picked

re
gadgets
vs
widgets
motif
managers
take
a
very
simplistic
approach
to
the
way
they
handle
events
for
gadgets
they
track
for
all
eventssuch
as
motion
notify
wether
or
not
the
gadget
expresses
interest
in
the
events
as
a
result
gadgets
typically
generate
a
great
deal
more
network
traffic
those
with
x
terminals
might
find
a
noticable
network
performance
drop
as
a
result
really
whats
the
point
using
gadgets
then
it
is
a
case
of
memory
vs
network
performance
tradeoff
gadgets
save
both
client
and
server
memory
but
memory
is
easily
expandable
while
network
performance
is
not
so
if
i
were
designing
motif
i
would
at
least
make
it
possible
to
avoid
using
gadgets
at
present
you
really
dont
have
a
choice
because
motif
forces
you
to
use
gadgets
in
menus
and
in
various
other
places
adrian
nye
oreilly
and
associates
inc
ive
been
using
the
xmgraph
widget
thats
been
floating
around
and
i
noticed
the
performance
is
significantly
better
using
gadgets
perhaps
even
faster
i
had
heard
in
an
old
programming
course
that
gadgets
were
no
longer
any
benefit
to
performance
and
that
its
just
as
well
to
use
widgets
everywhere
so
why
would
pushbutton
gadgets
be
a
lot
quicker
than
pushbuttons
in
the
graph
should
i
start
putting
gadgets
back
into
my
long
pulldown
menus
xmgraph

the

a

does
anybody
know
of
a

where

taught
computer
science
is
a
branch
of
maths
or
the
course
i
did
was
ive
also
done
a

much
more
practical
and
likely
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employer
really
wants
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
at
robert
gordon
university
programming
was
the
main
most
timeconsuming
start
of
the
course
the
first
two
years
consisted
of
five
subjects
software
engineering
pascalcunix
computer
engineering
assembler
computer
theory
lispprolog
mathematicsstatistics
and
communication
skills
how
to
pass
interviewsintelligence
tests
and
group
discussions
eg
how
to
survive
a
helicopter
crash
in
the
north
sea
the
third
year
industrial
placement
was
spent
working
for
a
computer
company
for
a
year
the
company
could
be
anywhere
in
europe
there
was
a
special
travel
allowance
scheme
to
cover
the
visiting
costs
of
professors
the
fourth
year
included
operating
software
engineering
assembler
real
time
laboratory
assembler
and
computing
theory
lisp
there
were
also
group
projects
in
and
years
where
students
worked
in
teams
to
select
their
own
project
or
decide
to
work
for
an
outside
company
the
only
disadvantage
being
that
specifications
would
change
suddenly
in
the
first
four
years
there
was
a
weighting
between
courseworks
and
exams
for
most
subjects
however
in
the
honours
year
this
was
reduced
to
a
split
between
an
individual
project
and
final
exams
no
coursework
assessment
are
all
computer
science
courses
like
this
btw
we
started
off
with
students
in
our
first
year
and
were
left
with
by
honours
year
also
every
course
is

a

patch
for

was
developed
by
conrad
kimball
ceksdcboeingcom
it

this

why
cant
gcc
compile
on
my
sparc
i
used
gcc
to
compile
the
whole
distribution
but
i
get
several
segmentation
faults
when
running
x
note
first
that
gcc
on
risc
machines
does
not
necessarily
result
in
any
performance
increase
it
certainly
is
not
as
noticeable
as
it
is
on
the
or
vax
platforms
here
is
the
problem
gcc
and
cc
use
incompatible
methods
of
passing
structures
as
arguments
and
returning
them
as
function
values
so
when
gcccompiled
parts
of
x
are
linked
with
sunsupplied
functions
that
pass
or
return
structs
runtime
errors
occur
affected
programs
include
rgb
and
the
server
this
is
from
the
gcc
manual
on
the
sparc
gnu
cc
uses
an
incompatible
calling
convention
for
structures
it
passes
them
by
including
their
contents
in
the
argument
list
whereas
the
standard
compiler
passes
them
effectively
by
reference
this
really
ought
to
be
fixed
but
such
calling
conventions
are
not
yet
supported
in
gnu
cc
so
it
isnt
straightforward
to
fix
it
the
convention
for
structure
returning
is
also
incompatible
and
fpccstructreturn
does
not
help
you
can
duck
the
problem
either
by
using
cc
throughout
or
by
using
it
for
just
the
routines
which
cause
incompatibilities
the
problem
cannot
be
solved
with
compilation
flags
files
which
need
to
be
compiled
using
cc
include
rgbrgbc
in
addition
several
of
the
inet

return
values
clientsxhostxhostc

what
you
are
seeing

a
sideeffect

a
kludge
in

to
get
sun
shared
libraries
working
apparently
you
cant
share
a
function
that
is
both
called
and
compared
as
xtinherit
is
this
was
handled
by
putting
xtinherit
in
the
same

as
a
function
that
is
always
used
thereby
guaranteeing
that
it
would
be
loaded
that
is
in
initializec
where
xttoolkitinitialize
and
xtinitialize
reside
these
routines
would
normally
be
called
you
are
probably
seeing
this
error
because
your
program
is
not
a
normal
xtbased
program

does
not
call
xttoolkitinitialize

osfmotifs
uil
had
this
problem
it
called
xtmalloc
and
other
xt
functions
the
solution
is
to
add
the
call
to
your
program
the
function
does
not
have
to
be
executed
just
linked
in
alternatively
your
program
doesnt
need
any
xt
functions
and
is
correct
in
not
calling
xttoolkitinitialize
it
may
be
an
xlib
or
xview
program
in
this
case
you
can
remove
lxt
from
your

command
it
should
not
be
necessary

why

me
sic
the

interface
for
retrieving
resources

is
sensitive

the

your

may
be
doing

xtnsensitive
is
a

which
on

is
a
single
byte
declaring
the

sensitive
as
boolean
works
properly
this
problem
comes
up
often
when
using
particular
toolkits
that
redefine
the
xt
types
dimension
and
position
code
that
assumes
they
are
int
will
have
similar
problems
if
those
types
are
actually
short
in
general
you
are
safe
if
you
use

it

subject
why
dont
xtconfigurewidgetxtresizewidgetxtmovewidget
work
youre
probably
trying
to
use
these
functions
from
application
code
they
should
be
used
only
internally
to
widgets
these
functions
are
for
a
parent
widget
to
change
the
geometry
of
its
children
other
promising
functions
xtmakegeometryrequest
and
xtmakeresizerequest
are
also
for
use
only
by
widgets
in
this
case
by
a
child
to
request
a
change
from
its
parent
the
only
way
for
your
application
to
request
a
geometry
change
for
a
widget
is
to
issue
an
xtsetvalues
call
setting
some
of
the
geometry
resources
although
this
will
result
in
the
widgetinternal
functions
being
called
your
application
code
must
use
the
standard
xtsetvalues
interface
or
risk
the
widgets
data
becoming
corrupted
the
xlib
calls
xmovewindow
and
xresizewindow
should
similarly
be
avoided
they
shouldnt
be
used
to
change
xtnx
xtny
xtnwidth
or
xtnheight
subject
why
isnt
there
an
xtreparentwidget
call
like
xreparentwindow
although
there
are
various
details
of
the
current
implementation
of
the
xt
internals
which
make
reparenting
difficult
the
major
reason
that
no
such
call
exists
is
that
it
remains
undefined
what
the
set
of
resources
for
the
new
widget
should
be
resources
are
typically
set
based
on
the
location
in
the
instance
hierarchy
what
resources
should
change
if
the
instance
moves
what
should
happen
to
the
widgets
children
and
by
the
time
such
semantics
are
defined
there
would
probably
be
little
advantage
over
destroying
the
old
widget
and
creating
a
new
widget
in
the
correct
location
with
the
desired
resources
as
setting
the
resources
correctly
is
the
majority
of
work
in
creating
a
new
widget

are

called
in
the
order
registered
although
some
books
demonstrate
that
the
current
implementation
of
xt
happens
to
call
callback
procedures
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
registered
the
specification
does
not
guarantee
such
a
sequence
and
supplemental
authoritative
documents
ie
the
asenteswick
volume
do
say
that
the
order
is
undefined
because
the
callback
list
can
be
manipulated
by
both
the
widget
and
the
application
xt
cannot
guarantee
the
order
of
execution
in
general
the
callback
procedures
should
be
thought
of
as
operating
independently
of
one
another
and
should
not
depend
on
sideeffects
of
other
callbacks
operating

why
doesnt

in
two

make
a

you
want

capture
clear

use
xgetimage

tell

the
easiest
way
for
an

otherwise
is

xopendisplay
uses

it
necessary
to
call

the
easiest
thing
to
do
is
to
create
a
single

window
that
is
as
large
as
the
largest
possible
screen
make
it
a
child
of
your
toplevel
window
and
it
will
be
clipped
to
that
window
so
it
wont
affect
any
other
application
it
needs
to
be
as
big
as
the
largest
possible
screen
in
case
the
user
enlarges
the
window
while
it
is
busy

moves
elsewhere
within
a
virtual

substitute

my

handle

pipe

file
input
its
very
common
to
need
to
write
an
xt
program
that
can
accept
input
both
from
a
user
via
the
x
connection

from
some
other
file
descriptor
but
which
operates
efficiently
and
without
blocking
on
either
the
x
connection
or
the
other
file
descriptor
a
solution
is
use
xtappaddinput
after
you
open
your
file
descriptor
use
xtappaddinput
to
register
an
input
handler
the
input
handler
will
be
called
every
time
there
is
something
on
the

requiring
your

attention
write
the

you
would
any
other
xt
callback
so
it
does
its
work
quickly
and
returns
it
is
important
to
use
only
nonblocking
io
system
calls
in
your
input
handlers
most
input
handlers
read
the

you
can
have
an
input
handler
write
or
handle
exception
conditions
if
you
wish
be
careful
when
you
register
an
input
handler
to
read
from
a
disk
file
you
will
find
that
the
function
is
called
even
when
there
isnt
input
pending
xtappaddinput
is
actually
working
as
it
is
supposed
to
the
input
handler
is
called
whenever
the
file
descriptor
is
ready
to
be
read
not
only
when
there
is
new
data
to
be
read
a
disk
file
unlike
a
pipe
or
socket
is
almost
always
ready
to
be
read
however
if
only
because
you
can
spin
back
to
the
beginning
and
read
data
youve
read
before
the
result
is
that
your
function
will
almost
always
be
called
every
time
around
xtappmainloop
there
is
a
way
to
get
the
type
of

what

the

a
single

a

can
support
several

the

two

one

takes
a

both

part

how
do
i
create
a
transparent
window
a
completely
transparent
window
is
easy
to
get
use
an
inputonly
window
in
order
to
create
a
window
which
is
mostly
transparent
you
have
several
choices
the
shape
extension
first
released

offers
an
easy
way
to
make
nonrectangular
windows
so
you
can
set
the
shape
of
the
window
to
fit
the
areas
where
the
window
should
be
nontransparent
however
not
all
servers
support
the
extension
a
machinespecific
method
of
implementing
transparent
windows
for
particular
servers
is
to
use
an
overlay
plane
supported
by
the
hardware
note
that
there
is
no
x
notion
of
a
transparent
color
index
a
generally
portable
solution
is
to
use
a
large
number
of
tiny
windows
but
this
makes
operating
on
the
application
as
a
unit
difficult
a
final
answer
is
to
consider
whether
you
really
need
a
transparent
window
or
if
you
would
be
satisfied
with
being
able
to
overlay
your
application
window
with
information
if
so
you
can
draw

why
doesnt

when

gxxor
you
may
expect
that
drawing
with

black
for
example
should
produce
white
however
the
drawing
operation
does
not
work
on
rgb
values

on
colormap
indices
the
color
that
the
resulting
colormap

actually
points
to
is
undefined

visually
random
unless
you
have
actually
filled
it
in
yourself
on

black

white
often
or
programs
taking
advantage
of
this
mathematical
coincidence
will
break
if
you
want
to
be
combining
colors
with
gxxor
then
you
should
be
allocating
a
number
of
your
own
color
cells
and
filling
them
with
your
chosen
precomputed
values
if
you
want
to
use
gxxor
simply
to
switch
between
two
colors
then
you
can
take
the
shortcut
of
setting
the
background
color
in
the
gc
graphics
context
to
and
the
foreground
color
to
a
value
such
that
when
it
draws
over
red
say
the
result
is
blue
and
when
it
draws
over
blue
the
result
is
red
this
foreground

is
itself
the

of

got

you
sent

what
you
should
do
is
send
the

install
an

handler
to
catch
any

would
indicate

running

in

put

the
second
application
then
retrieves
the

whose
name
it
also
knows
and
then
can
draw

it

note
this
scheme
works
iff

do
timeouts
which
means
systemdependent
code
on
most
unixish
implementations
you
can
use
xconnectionnumber
to
get
the
file
descriptor
of
the
x
connection
and
then
use
select
or
something
similar
on
that
note
that
many
userinterface
references
suggest
that
a
doubleclick
be
used
to
extend
the
action
indicated
by
a
singleclick
if
this
is
the
case
in
your
interface
then
you
can
execute
the
first
action
and
as
a
compromise
check
the
timestamp
on
the
second
event
to
determine
whether
it
too
should
be
the
singleclick
action
or
the
doubleclick
action

how

xlib
intentionally
does
not
provide
such
sophisticated
graphics
capabilities
leaving
them
up
to
serverextensions
or
clientsside
graphics
libraries
your
only
choice
if
you
want
to
stay
within
the
core
x
protocol
is
to
render
the
text
into
a
pixmap
read
it
back
via
xgetimage
rotate
it
by
hand
with
whatever
matrices
you
want
and
put
it
back
to
the
server
via
xputimage
more
specifically
create
a
bitmap
b
and
write
your
text
to
it
create
an
xybitmap
image
i
from
b
via
xgetimage
create

b
x
sintheta
y
costheta
render
note
that
you
should
be
careful
how
you
implement
this
not
to
lose
bits
an
algorithm
based
on
shear
transformations
may
in
fact
be
better
the
highlevel
serverextensions
and
graphics
packages
available
for
x
also
permit
rendering
of
rotated
text
display
postscript
pex
phigs
and
gks
although
most
are
not
capable
of
arbitrary
rotation
and
probably
do
not
use
the
same
fonts
that
would
be
found
on
a
printer
in
addition
if
you
have
enough
access
to
the
server
to
install
a
font
on
it
you
can
create
a
font
which
consists
of
letters
rotated
at
some
predefined
angle
your
application
can
then
itself
figure
out
placement
of
each
glyph

this
is
a
simple
x
graphics
question
assume
you
have
a
valid
window
w
an
icon
pixmap
and
the
background
mask
also
a
pixmap
for
that
icon
you
wish
to
place
the
icon
at
xy
in
w
without
the
background
question
what
combination
of
xcopyarea
and
gc
functions
are
necessary
i
think
the
idea
is
to
merge
only
those
pixels
of
pixmap
into
w
as
indicated
by
the
corresponding
mask
pixel
value
specifically
the
problem
involves
a
pixmap
and
mask
generated
by
the
xpm
libs
any
clues
would
be
most
appreciated
xpm
provides
you
with
symbolic
color
names
which
can
be
specified
at
load
time
so
for
doing
what
you
want
i
would
suggest
you
to
define
a
background
symbol
in
your
pixmap
file
which
youll
set
to
whatever
color
is
used
by
the
widget
or
the
window
on
which
you
want
to
put
your
pixmap
this
would
surely
be
the
simplest
and
fastest
way
to
do
what
you
want
no
as
soon
as
you
blit
two
of
this
icons
once
on
top
of
the
other
with
a
little
dislocation
you
see
the
rectangular
blit
crashes
too
much
of
the
icon
first
blitted
because
it
draws
a
full
rectangle
the
way
to
do
it
is
masking
create
a
bitmap
with
all
pixels
to
be
merged
are
and
all
not
to
be
merged
are
then
set
the
clipmask
of
the
gc
to
this
bitmap
set
the
clipxorigin
and
clipyorigin
of
the
gc
to
the
xy
coordinates
where
you
blit
the
icon
to
the
destination
drawable
use
gxcopy
and
xcopyarea
the

what
is
lowbandwidth
x
lbx
xremote
ppp
slip
cslip
there
are
several
options
for
using
x
over
serial
lines
slip
serial
line
ip
this
is
both
a
mechanism
and
a
protocol
for
sending
ip
packets
over
pointtopoint
serial
links
it
has
been
around
for
several
years
and
implementations
are
available
for
many
of
the
major
tcpip
implementations
most
x
terminal
vendors
supply
this
as
a
checkoff
item
although
nobody
really
ever
uses
it
since
it
is
horribly
slow
the
tcpip
headers
add
bytes
per
packet
and
the
tcpip
encoding
of
the
x
protocol
is
rather
verbose
rightfully
so
it
is
optimized
for
packing
and
unpacking
over
highspeed
links
cslip
compressed
header
slip
this
is
a
variant
of
slip
that
compresses
the
bytes
of
tcpip
headers
down
to
about
or
bytes
it
still
doesnt
do
anything
about
reencoding
the
x
protocol
modems
that
do
compression
can
help
but
they
increase
packet
latency
it
takes
time
to
dribble
the
uncompressed
data
through
typical
serial
interfaces
plus
the
compression
assembly
time
ppp
pointtopoint
protocol
this
is
an
emerging
standard
for
pointtopoint
links
over
serial
lines
that
has
a
more
complete
set
of
option
negotiation
than
slip
a
growing
number
of
people
see
the
combination
of
ppp
for
the
serial
line
management
and
cslip
for
the
header
compression
as
becoming
common
for
running
normal
tcpip
protocols
over
serial
lines
running
raw
x
over
the
wire
still
needs
compression
somewhere
to
make
it
usable
xremote
this
is
the
name
of
both
a
protocol
and
set
of
products
originally
developed
by
ncd
for
squeezing
the
x
protocol
over
serial
lines
in
addition
to
using
a
low
level
transport
mechanism
similar
to
pppcslip
xremote
removes
redundancies
in
the
x
protocol
by
sending
deltas
against
previous
packets
and
using
lzw
to
compress
the
entire
data
stream
this
work
is
done
by
either
a
pseudox
server
or
proxy
running
on
the
host
or
in
a
terminal
server
there
are
several
advantages
to
doing
compression
outside
the
modem
you
dont
have
to
have
compressing
modems
in
there
if
you
wouldnt
otherwise
be
using
them
eg
if
you
were
going
to
be
directly
connected
and
it
reduces
the
io
overhead
by
cutting
down
on
the
number
of
bytes
that
have
to
cross
the
serial
interface
and
in
addition
to
the
effects
of
it
reduces
the
latency
in
delivering
packets
by
not
requiring
the
modem
to
buffer
up
the
data
waiting
for
blocks
to
compress

chaired
by
ncd
and
xerox
and
is
using
ncds
xremote
protocol
as
a
stepping
stone
in
developing
the
new

lbx
will
go
beyond
xremote
by
adding
proxy
caching
of
commonlyused
information
eg
connection
setup
data
large
window
properties
font
metrics

a

what

probably
happening
is
that

your

runs

is
running

so
killing

to

run

how
can
i
change
the
titlebar

my
xterm
window
the
solution
involves
sending
an
escape
sequence
to
xterm

will
cause
it
to
update
the
property
which
the
window
manager
relies
upon
for
the
string
which
appears
in
the
window
titlebar
a
solution
is
as
easy
as
typing
this
in
an
xterm
running
a

echo
where
esc
is
the
escape
key
text
is
the

g
is

the
bel
character
here
is
a
more
complicated
csh

changes
the
titlebar
to
the
current
working
directory
when
you
change
directories
alias
newcd
cd
echo
n
the
digit
in
these
strings
indicates
to

it
should
change
only
the
title
of
the
window
to
change
both
the
title
and
the
name
used
in

use
the

use

lets
take
apart
the
example
suppose
the
applications
class
name
is
myterm
also
suppose
open
windows
is
installed
in
usropenwin
notice
the
example
omits
localespecific
lookup
means
openwinhomelibtn
means
usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm
as
the
application
initializes
xt
tries
to
open
both
of
the
above
appdefaults
files
in
the
order
shown
as
soon
as
it
finds
one
it
reads
it
and
uses
it
and
stops
looking
for
others
the
effect
of
this
path
is
to
search
first
in
then
in
usropenwin
lets
consider
another
example
this
time
lets
set
xuserfilesearchpath
so
it
looks
for
the
file
mytermad
in
the
current
working
directory
then
for
myterm
in
the
directory
appdefaults
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
nadhomeappdefaultsn
the
first
path
in
the
list
expands
to
mytermad
the
second
expands
to
homeappdefaultsmyterm
this
is
a
convenient
setting
for
debugging
because
it
follows
the
imake
convention
of
naming
the
appdefaults
file
mytermad
in
the
applications
source
directory
so
you
can
run
the
application
from
the
directory
in
which
you
are
working
and
still
have
the
resources
loaded
properly
note
when
looking
for
appdefault
files
with
xuserfilesearchpath
for
some
bizarre
reason
neither
the
type
nor
file
suffix
is
defined
so
t
and
s
are
useless
with
theres
another
twist
you
may
specify
a
customization
resource
value
for
example
you
might
run
the
myterm
application
like
this
myterm
xrm
customization
color
if
one
of
your
pathname
specifications
had
the
value
then
the
expanded
pathname
would
be
because
the
c
substitution
character
takes
on
the
value
of
the
customization
resource
the
default
xfilesearchpath
compiled
into
xt
is
note
some
sites
replace
with
a
projectroot
in
this
batch
of
default
settings
the
default
xuserfilesearchpath
also
compiled
into
xt
is
rootlnc
rootlnc
rootnc
rootln
rootln
rootn
root
is
either
the
value
of
xapplresdir
or
the
users
home
directory
if
xapplresdir
is
not
set
if
you
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
some
value
other
than
the
default
xt
ignores
xapplresdir
altogether
notice
that
the
quick
and
dirty
way
of
making
your
application
find
your
appdefaults
file
in
your
current
working
directory
is
to
set
xapplresdir
to
a
single
dot
in
all
this
machinery
worked
differently
for
compatibilty
many
people
set
their
xapplresdir
value
to
a
dot
followed
by
a
slash

how

how
do

ways
to
avoid
having
to
do
a

whenever
you
log
in

running

one
solution
is
to
use
the

it

a

to
start
an

in
one
solution
is

xrlogin
program
from
der
mouse
mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu
you
can
ftp
caveatemptor
versions
from
in
xxrloginc
and
xxrlogindc
the
program
packages
up
term
and
display
into
a
single
string
which
is
stuffed
into
term
rlogin
then
propagates
term
normally
your
cshrc
on
the
remote
machine
should
contain
eval
xrlogind
where
xrlogind
is
a
program
that
checks
term
and
if
it
is
of
the
special
format
it
recognizes
unpacks
it
and
spits
out
setenv
and
unsetenv
commands
to
recreate
the
environment
variables
in

if
all
you
need
to
do
is
start

you
find

simple
display

then
this
version
of

i
choose
pointer
in

every

it
can
you
give

the

fails

because
xcmstekhvcquerymaxv
returns
a

than
xcmstekhvcqueryminv
does
which
makes
no
sense
to
me
the
xtici
editor
fails
in
xcmsstorecolors
apparently
because
the
mathematical
manipulations
of

results
in
invalid

so
you
cant

the

send

where
is
the
name
of
the

and
is
usually
just
the
number
of
the

here
are
a
few
complications
fix
is
in
four
parts
you
need
to
request
and
separately
the

sungxuu

an

was
rereleased

replaces
the

was
optional
fix
also
needs
pexlibtarz
which
you
can
obtain
from
xstuff
by
asking
for
fix
is
in
parts
through
subject
what
is
the
xstuff
mailarchive
the
xstuff
server
is
a
mailresponse
program
that
means
that
you
mail
it
a
request
and
it
mails
back
the
response
any
of
the
four
possible
commands
must
be
the
first
word
on
a
line
the
xstuff
server
reads
your
entire
message
before
it
does
anything
so
you
can
have
several
different
commands
in
a
single
message
unless
you
ask
for
help
the
xstuff
server
treats
the
subject
header
line
just
like
any
other
line
of
the
message
the
archives
are
organized
into
a
series
of
directories
and
subdirectories
each
directory
has
an
index
and
each
subdirectory
has
an
index
the
toplevel
index
gives
you
an
overview
of
what
is
in
the
subdirectories
and
the
index
for
each
subdirectory
tells
you
what
is
in
it
the
command
help
or
send
help
causes
the
server
to
send
you
a
more
detailed
version
of
this
help
file
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
index
then
the
server
will
send
you
the
toplevel
index
of
the
contents
of
the
archive
if
there
are
other
words
on
that
line
that
match
the
name
of
subdirectories
then
the
indexes
for
those
subdirectories
are
sent
instead
of
the
toplevel
index
for
example
you
can
say
send
index
fixes
or
index
fixes
a
message
that
requests
an
index
cannot
request
data
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
send
then
the
xstuff
server
will
send
you
the
items
named
on
the
rest
of
the
line
to
name
an
item
you
give
its
directory
and
its
name
for
example
send
fixes
you
may
issue
multiple
send
requests
the
xstuff
server
contains
many
safeguards
to
ensure
that
it
is
not
monopolized
by
people
asking
for
large
amounts
of
data
the
mailer
is
set
up
so
that
it
will
send
no
more
than
a
fixed
amount
of
data
each
day
if
the
work
queue
contains
more
requests
than
the
days
quota
then
the
unsent
files
will
not
be
processed
until
the
next
day
whenever
the
mailer
is
run
to
send
its
days
quota
it
sends
the
requests
out
shortestfirst
some
mailers
produce
mail
headers
that
are
unusable
for
extracting
return
addresses
if
you
use
such
a
mailer
you
wont
get
any
response
if
you
happen
to
know
an
explicit
path
you
can
include
a
line
like

what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
try
the
msc
computing
science
course
at
the
real
newcastle
university
its
a
conversion
course
but
at
least
they
teach
real
programming
in
the
space
of
months
we
were
taught
pascal
simula
prolog
miranda
also
some
basic
low
level
stuff
was
covered
as
well
they
also
did
concurrent
programming
and
operating
systems
some
software
engineering
plus
quite
a
few
optional
units
including
database
theory
and
some
stuff
about
comms
the
pascal
is
to
be
replaced
by
cc
i
think
next
year
i
learnt
this
and
x
windows
programming
as
well
anyway
via
a
good
selection
of
project
over
the
final
three
months
depending
on
your
tastes
the
selection
of
skills
learnt
can
be
quite
wide
reaching
the
one
critiscism
i
would
level
at
the
course
which
i
would
have
thought
invaluable
is
the
lack
of
an
option
to
do
the
project
period
in
industry
this
would
probably
need
a
slightly
longer
project
period
say
six
months
but
would
enhance
the
prestige
and
usefulness
of
an
already
excellent
and
thorough
course
yes
i
know
this
sounds
like
a
plug
for
the
course
why
not

this
is
because

that
is
the

larger

i

heard
that
ford
motor
company
has
had
a
recruiting
bias
toward
engineers
and
away
from
computer
science
graduates
the
reasoning
is
supposedly
to
better
meet
long

this
is
evidenced
by
the
large
number
of
cs
people
who
are

are
not
brought
on

except
in
special
circumstances
this
is
a
generalization
which
obviously
doesnt
always
hold
true
but
there
are
statistics
furthermore
most
software
engineering
at
ford
gets
done
by
electrical
engineers
i
know
of
univerities
that
have
merged
the
computer
science
department
and
the
electrical
engineering
so
that
you
can
get
a
computer
degree
which
qualifies
you
for
much
more
than
programming
but
since
my
beliefs
and
opinions
are
merely
figments
of
my
distorted
imagination
i
suppose
i
should
keep
it

myself

something
out

note
that

what

about

the

and
and
manipulate
them
in

what
i
hate
about
guis
having
to
switch
between

i
guess
i
have
a
strong
onehanded
preference
i
like
to
use
a
computer
with
one
hand
and
use
the
other
for
holding
something

paper
of

that
most

can
be
done
with

such
as
navigating
cutting
pasting
searching
opening

saving
files
etc
the
main
thing
i
need

use
both

for
is
entering

i

admittedly
a

is
very
annoying
to
look
at
back
when

i
remember
their
man

have
some
keywords
displayed
with
underlining
so
my
question
is
how
do
i
change
the
xterms
behaviour
under

for
nroff

to
perhaps
underlining

at

i
dont

the

somehow
xterm
allows

on
how
you
can

best
possible
performance
from

windows
on
your

without

more

performance
is
a
highly
subjective
issue
the
individual
user
must
balance
speed
versus
features
in
order
to
come
to
a
personal
decision
therefore
this

be
be

to
contain

amongst

this

is
specifically

there
are

many

window

there
are
a
lot
of
window
managers
out
there
with
lots
of
different
features
and
abilities
the
choice
of
which
to
use
is
by
necessity
a
balancing
act
between
performance
and
useful
features
at
this
point
most
respondents
have
agreed
upon
twm
as
the
best
candidate
for
a
speedy
window
manager
a
couple
of
generic
tricks
you
can
try
to
soup
up
your
window
manger
is
turning
off
unnecessary
things
like
zooming
and
opaque
move
also
if
you
lay
out
your
windows
in
a
tiled
manner
you
reduce
the
amount
of
cpu
power
spent
in
raising
and
lowering
overlapping
windows
joe

ive
found
that
a
good
font
for
tiling
is
aka
it
is
the
biggest
font
i
know
of
that
i
can
use
on
my

and
still
get

sidebyside
on

which

make
sure
that
your

is
a
proper
match
for
your
hardware
if
you
have
a
monochrome
monitor
use
a
monochrome
server
on
my
monochrome
sun
i
havent
noticed
much
difference
between
the
xsun
colour
server
and
xsunmono
however
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
xsunmono
is
about
smaller
and
therefore
should
contribute
to
less
paging

how
your
server
was
compiled
can
also
make
a
difference
jeff
law
lawschirfcsutahedu
advises
us
that
on
a
sun
system
x
should
be
compiled
with
gcc
version
or
with
the
unbundled
sun
compiler
you
can
expect
to
get
very
large
speedups
in
the
server
by
not
using
the
bundled
sunos
compiler
i
assume
that
similar
results
would
occur
if
you
used
one
of
the
other
highquality
commercial
compilers
on
the
market
locking
the
server
into
ram
has
anyone
tried
hacking
the
x
server
so
that
it
is
locked
into
ram
and
does
not
get
paged
eg
via
a
call
to
plock
does
this
help
performance
at
all
ive
had
one
inquiry
on
this
topic
and
a
few
pointers
to
the
plock
function
call
but
no
hard
evidence
from
someone
whos
tried
it
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
give
it

try

starting
your
server
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
if
you
start
up
a
lot
of
clients
in
your
xsession
or
whatever
sleep
for
a
second
or
two
after
launching
each
one
after
i
changed
my
xclients
script
to
do
this
logging
in
actually
took
less
time
we
have
a
heavily
loaded
system
without
much
core
though
this
sounds
crazy
but
i
have
confirmed
that
it
works
warner
losh
impsolbournecom
provided
me
with
a
good
explanation
of
why
this
works
which
i
have
summarized
here
when
you
start
up
an
x
server
it
takes
a
huge
amount
of
time
to
start
accepting
connections
a
lot
of
initialization
is
done
by
the
server
when
it
starts
this
process
touches
a
large
number
of
pages
any
other
process
running
at
the
same
time
would
fight
the
server
for
use
of
the
cpu
and
more
importantly
memory
if
you
put
a
sleep
in
there
you
give
the
server
a
chance
to
get
itself
sorted
out
before
the
clients
start
up
similarly
there
is
also
a
lot
of
initialization
whenever
an
x
client
program
starts
toolkits
registering
widgets
resources
being
fetched
programs
initializing
state
and
databases
and
so
forth
all
this
activity
is
typically
memory
intensive
once
this
initialization
is
done
the
process
has
reached
a
steady
state
the
memory
usage
typically
settles
down
to
using
only
a
few
pages
by
using
sleeps
to
stagger
the
launching
of
your
clients
in
your
xinitrc
you
avoid
them
fighting
each
other
for
your
workstations
limited
resources
this
is
most
definitely
a
your
mileage
may
vary
situation
as
there
are
so
many
variables
to
be
considered
available
ram
local
swap
space
load
average
number
of
users
on
your
system
which
clients
you
are
starting
etc
currently
in
my
xinitrc
i
have
a
situation
like
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
experimented
with
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
even
tried
sleep
exec
startxclientsscript
and
then
in
startxclientsscript
i
had
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
the
idea
with
this
last
one
was
to
make
sure
that
xinit
had
completely
finished
processing
my
xinitrc
and
had
settled
down
into
a
steady
state
before
the
sleep
expired
and
all
my
clients
were
launched
all
of
these
yielded
fairly
comparable
results
and
so
i
just
stuck
with
my
current
setup
for
its
simplicity
you
will
probably
have
to
experiment
a
bit
to
find
a
setup
which
suits
you
fonts
loading
fonts
takes
time
and
ram
if
you
minimize
the
number
of
fonts
your
applications
use
youll
get
speed
increases
in
loadup
time
one
simple
strategy
is
to
choose
a
small
number
of
fonts
one
small
one
large
one
roman
whatever
suits
you
and
configure
all
your
clients
or
at
least
all
your
heavily
used
clients
to
use
only
those
few
fonts
client
programs
should
start
up
quicker
if
their
font
is
already
loaded
into
the
server
this
will
also
conserve
server
resources
since
fewer
fonts
will
be
loaded
by
the
server

eg
my
main
xterm
font
is
so
i
also
have
twm
set
up
to
use
in
all
its
menus
and
icons
etc
twms
default
font
is
since
i
dont
normally
use
ive
eliminated
one
font
from
my
server
oliver
jones
ojroadrunnerpictelcom
keep
fonts
local
to
the
workstation
rather
than
loading
them
over
nfs
if
you
will
make
extensive
use
of
scalable
fonts
use
a
font
server
about
the
resources
file
keep
your
xresources
xdefaults
file
small
saves
ram
and
saves
on
server
startup
time
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
one
suggestion
in
your
xdefaults
xresources
file
try
putting
only
the
minimum
number
of
resources
that
you
want
to
have
available
to
all
of
your
applications
for
example
reversevideo
true
then
separate
your
resources
into
individual
clientspecific
resource
files
for
example
homelibappdefaults
in
your
login
file
set
the
environment
variable
xuserfilesearchpath
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
homelibappdefaultsn
the
compwindowsx
frequently
asked
questions
faq
contains
an
excellent
explanation
of
how
these
environment
variables
work
ed
so
when
xterm
launches
it
loads
its
resources
from
appdefaultsxterm
xdvi
finds
them
in
appdefaultsxdvi
and
so
on
and
so
forth
note
that
not
all
clients
follow
the
same
xxxxx
resourcefile
naming
pattern
you
can
check
in
your
system
appdefaults
directory
often
to
find
the
proper
name
and
then
name
your
personal
resource
files
with
the
same
name
this
is
all
documented
in
the
xt
specification

mikeleecornelledu
kevin
is
willing
mail
his
setup
files
to
inquirers
this
method
of
organizing
your
personal
resources
has
the
following
benefits
easier
to
maintain
more
usable
fewer
resources
are
stored
in
the
x
server
in
the
resourcemanager
property
as
a
side
benefit
your
server
may
start
fractionally
quicker
since
it
doesnt
have
to
load
all
your
resources
applications
only
process
their
own
resources
never
have
to
sort
through
all
of
your
resources
to
find
the
ones
that
affect
them
it
also
has
drawbacks
the
application
that
you
are
interested
in
has
to
load
an
additional
file
every
time
it
starts
up
this
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
much
of
a
performance
difference
and
you
might
consider
this
a
huge
boon
to
usability
if
you
are
modifying
an
applications
resource
database
you
just
need
to
rerun
the
application
without
having
to
xrdb
again
xrdb
will
by
default
run
your
xdefaults
file
through
cpp
when
your
resources
are
split
out
into
multiple
resource
files
and
then
loaded
by
the
individual
client
programs
they
will
not
watch
out
for
this
i
had
c
style
comments
in
my
xdefaults
file
which
cpp
stripped
out
when
i
switched
to
this
method
of
distributed
resource
files
i
spent
several
frustrating
days
trying
to
figure
out
why
my
clients
were
not
finding
their
resources
xt
did
not
provide
any
error
message
when
it
encountered
the
c
style
comments
in
the
resource
files
it
simply
silently
aborted
processing
the
resource
file
the
loss
of
preprocessing
which
can
be
very
handy
eg
ifdef
color
is
enough
to
cause
some
people
to
dismiss
this
method
of
resource
management
you
may
also
run
into
some
clients
which
break
the
rules
for
example
neither
emacs
nor
xvt
will
find
their
resources
if
they
are
anywhere
other
than
in
xdefaults
when
starting
up
a
client
on
a
machine
that
does
not
share
files
with
the
machine
where
your
resources
are
stored
your
client
will
not
find
its
resources
loading
all
your
resources
into
the
server
will
guarantee
that
all
of
your
clients
will
always
find
their
resources
casey
leedom
caseygaussllnlgov
a
possible
compromise
suggestion
that
i
have
and
am
planning
on
trying
is
to
put
resources
for
all
my
heavily
used
clients
eg
xterm
into
my
xdefaults
file
and
to
use
the
separate
resources
files
method
for
clients
that
i
seldom
use
define
your
display
properly
client
programs
are
often
executed
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
in
that
situation
rather
than
setting
your
display
environment
variable
to
where
hostname
is
the
name
of
your
workstation
you
should
set
your
display
variable
to
or
by
doing
this
you
access
optimized
routines
that
know
that
the
server
is
on
the
same
machine
and
use
a
shared
memory
method
of
transferring
requests

horgan
see
the

further
explanation
of
how
to
properly
set
your
display
name
i
dont
think
its
stock
mit
but
at
least
data
general
and
hp
have
libraries
that
are
smart
enough
to
use
local
communication
even
when
the

isnt

rob
sartin
jody
goldberg
jodyalgorithmicscom
sent
me
an
xlib
patch
to
change
stock
to
use
local
communication
even
if
display
is
not
properly
set
i
dont
want
to
get
in
the
business
of
distributing
or
trying
to
juggle
nonmit
patches
and
so
have
elected
not
to
include
it
here
hopefully
mit
will
apply
this
minor
lines
patch
themselves
in
the
meantime
if
you
want
to
try
it
yourself
email
jody
ed
clients
if
you
only
have
a
few
megabytes
of
ram
then
you
should
think
carefully
about
the
number
of
programs
you
are
running
think
also
about
the
kind
of
programs
you
are
running
for
example
is
there
a
smaller
clock
program
than
xclock
unfortunately
i
havent
really
noticed
that
programs
advertise
how
large
they
are
so
the
onus
is
on
us
to
do
the
research
and
spread
the
word
suggestions
on
better
alternatives
to
the
some
of
the
standard
clients
eg
xclock
xterm
xbiff
are
welcome
ed
ive
received
some
contradictory
advice
from
people
on
the
subject
of
x
client
programs
some
advocate
the
use
of
programs
that
are
strictly
xlib
based
since
xt
xaw
and
other
toolkits
are
rather
large
others
warn
us
that
other
applications
which
you
are
using
may
have
already
loaded
up
one
or
more
of
these
shared
libraries
in
this
case
using
a
nonxt
for
example
client
program
may
actually
increase
the
amount
of
ram
consumed
the
upshot
of
all
this
seems
to
be
dont
mix
toolkits
that
is
try
and
use
just
athena
clients
or
just
xview
clients
or
just
motif
clients
etc
if
you
use
more
than
one
then
youre
dragging
in
more
than
one
toolkit
library
know
your
environment
and
think
carefully
about
which
client
programs
would
work
best
together
in
that
environment

xvt
suggested
by
richard
hesketh
available
exportlcsmitedu
in
if
you
dont
need
all
the
esoteric
features
of
xterm
then
get
hold
of
xvt
it
was
written
here
just
to
save
swap
space
as
xterm
is
rather
a
hog
this
was
written
as
a
partial
clone
of
xterm
you
dont
have
to
rename
your
resources
as
xvt
pretends
to
be
xterm
in
its
current
version
you
cannot
bind
keys
as
you
can
in
xterm
ive
heard
that
there
are
versions
of
xvt
with
this
feature
but
ive
not
found
any
yet
update
march
i
recently
had
a
few
email
conversations
with
brian
warkentin
brianwarkentineengsuncom
regarding
xvt
he
questions
whether
xvt
really
is
at
all
faster
than
xterm
for
instance
xvt
may
initialize
slightly
faster
but
compare
scrolling
speed
try
this
quickie
benchmark
bintime
dd
ifetctermcap
and
see
which
program
can
scroll
faster
also
while
xterm
may
be
slightly
larger
in
ram
requirements
we
dont
have
any
hard
numbers
here
does
anyone
else
shared
libraries
and
shared
text
segments
mean
that
xterms
paging
requirements
are
not
that
major
as
an
experiment
he
ripped
out
all
the
tek
stuff
from
xterm
but
it
made
little
difference
since
if
you
never
use
it
it
never
gets
brought
into
memory
so
here
we
stand
with
some
conflicting
reports
on
the
validity
of
xvt
over
xterm
in
summary
caveat
emptor
your
mileage
may
vary
if
you
can
provide
some
hard
data
id
like
to
see
it
specifically
how
much
ram
each
occupies
how
much
swap

from
scott
barman

comes
a
suggestion
regarding
motif
text
field
widgets
i
noticed
that
during
data
entry
into
motif
text
field
widgets
i
was
getting
a
slight
lag
in
response
to
some
keystrokes
particularly
the
initial
one
in
the
field
examining
the
what
was
going
on
with
xscope
i
found
it
it
seems
that
when
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
is
nonzero
and
the
focus
is
on
a
text
field
widget
or
even
just
a
text
widget
the
ibeam
cursor
will
blink
every
time
the
cursor
appears
or
disappears
in
those
widgets
the
widget
code
is
making
a
request
to
the
server
copyarea
the
user
can
stop
this
by
setting
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
to
it
is
not
noticeable
on
a
sparc
but
it
does
make
a
little
difference
on
a
slower
system
this
specific
suggestion
can
probably
be
applied
in
general
to
lots
of
areas
consider
your
heavily
used
clients
are
there
any
minor
embellishments
that
can
be
turned
off
and
thereby
save
on
server
requests
miscellaneous
suggestions
pretty
pictures
dont
use
large
bitmaps
gifs
etc
as
root
window
backgrounds
the
more
complicated
your
root
window
bitmap
the
slower
the
server
is
at
redrawing
your
screen
when
you
reposition
windows
or
redraw
etc
these
take
up
ram
and
cpu
power
i
work
on
a
sun
sparc
and
im
conscious
of
performance
issues
i
cant
comprehend
it
when
i
see
people
with
a
sun
running
xphoon
as
their
root
window
ill
let
someone
else
figure
out
how
much
ram
would
be
occupied
by
having
a
full
screen
root
image
on
a
colour
workstation
if
youre
anything
like
me
you
need
all
the

real

that
you
can
get
for

and
so
rarely
see
the

use

widget
again
stick
to
as

as
possible
better
yet
dont
use
motif
at
all
its
an
absolute
pig
dont
create
and
destroy
widgets
on
the
fly
try
to
reuse
them
this
will
avoid
many
problems
with
buggy
toolkits
too
use
a
line
width
of

gcs
on
some
servers
this
makes
a
huge
difference
compress

collapse
multiple

this
can
make
the

just
a
small
remark
i
once
heard
that
using
a
better
malloc
function
would
greatly
increase
performance
of
xt
based
applications
since
they
use
malloc
heavily
they
suggested
trying
out
the
gnuy
malloc
but
i
didnt
find
the
time
yet
i
did
some
tests
on
small
programs
just
doing
malloc
and
free
and
the
differences
were
indeed
very
noticeable
somewhat
times
faster
any
confirmation
on
this
from
anyone
ed
andre
beck
andrebeckirsinftudresdende
unnecessary
noexpose
events
most
people
use
xcopyareaxcopyplane
as
fastest
blit
routines
but
they
forget
to
reset
graphicsexposures
in
the
gc
used
for
the
blits
this
will
cause
a
noexpose
event
every
blit
that
in
most
cases
only
puts
load
onto
the
connection
and
forces
the
client
to
run
through
its
eventloop
again
and
again
thousands
of
xchangegc
requests
this
gfx
context
switching
is
also
seen
in
most
handcoded
xapps
where
only
one
or
few
gcs
are
created
and
then
heavily
changed
again
and
again
xt
uses
a
definitely
better
mechanism
by
caching
and
sharing
a
lot
of
gcs
with
all
needed
parameters
this
will
remove
the
load
of
subsequent
xchangegc
requests
from
the
connection
by
moving
it
toward
the

the
server
and
the

are
competing
for
the
same
cpu
as
your

when
you
run
it
on
the

machine
not
really
a
major
problem
except
that
the
client
and
the
server
are
in
absolute
synchronicity
and
are
context
thrashing
timothy
h
panton
thpwesthawkuucp
firstly
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
most
cpus
are
mostly
idle
xs
cpu
usage
is
bursty
so
the
chances
of
you
and
your
teammate
doing
something
cpuintensive
at
the
same
time
is
small
if
they
are
not
then
you
get
twice
the
cpumemory
available
for
your
action
the
second
factor
is
that
context
switches
are
expensive
using
cpus
halves
them
you
pay
a
price
due
to
the
overhead
of
going
over
the
network
but
this
is
offset
in
most
cases
by
the
improved
buffering
of
a
network

vs
for
a

even
fewer

re

hello
when

an

message
saying
cannot
load
appdefaults
file
check
your
xapplresdir
environment
variable
and
then
put
the

builderxcessory
this
is
the
appdefaults
file
for
bx
in
the
directory
specified
by
the
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
if
you
dont
have
an
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
then
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
be
the
directory
where
the
builderxcessory
file
is
you
can
do
this
using
the
setenv
command
under
csh
note
that
the
name
ends
in

so
you
will
have
to
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
bxnad
to
get
the
appdefaults
to
load
correctly
to
make
sure
the
the

can
be
read

make

if
you
look
closely
at
motif
you
will
see
that
it
is
just
mswindows
with
more
eyepleasing
color
and
texture
the
only
real
difference
is
that
an
ms
application
window
can
contain
other
toplevel
children
while
a
motif
application
window
launches
its
children
out
onto
the
desktop
aab
to
those
of
you
familiar
with
both
guis
is
this
correct
my
experience
aab
with
x
makes
me
think
that
this
msw
behavior
is
easily
duplicated
aab
with
but
i
dont
know
msw
another
important
difference
is
that
msw
doesnt
have
any
window
that
handle
sophisticated
geometry
management
like
xmform
also
i
believe
that
in
windows
youre
limited
to
of
resources
windows
menus
icons
etc
imho
this
whole
discussion
named
motif
looks
like
mswindogs
is
totally
stupid
the
only
thing
remotely
influenced
here
can
be
the
motif
window
manager
that
features
an
arrangement
of
buttons
and
menus
somewhat
similiar
to
this
of
the
msw
windowmanaging
agent
however
its
name
is
but
mwm
is
only
a
small
part
of
motif
in
fact
mwm
and
motif
can
work
without
each
other
and
if
one
doesnt
like
mwms
outfit
for
some
reason
he
switches
to
another
windowmanager
all
this
doesnt
influence
motif
which
is
a
toolkit
of
widgets
to
write
applications
and
this
toolkit
is
imho
uncomparable
to
msw
because
it
is
much
more
wellorganized
and
features
alot
of
goodies
more
than
the
msw
interface
you
cannot
say
a
porsche
looks
like
a
vw
kfer
only
because
they
have
the
wheel
and
the
gear
at
the
same
position
motif
and
msw
are
complete
different
worlds
only
one
element
of
the
motif
world
has
some
gear
and
wheel
at
the
same
position
as
msw

do
too
i
am
saying
that
ui
designers
must
carefully
distinguish
between
the
userprogrammer
conceptual
models
and
they
must
ultimately
serve
the
user
of
the
system
not
the
builder
of
the
system
i
dont
recall
the
actual
stats
but
something
like
in
people
can
be
categorized
as
a
symbol
manipulator
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
more
about
the
meaning
and
basis
for
this
claim
at
any
rate
i
dont
think
this
is
evidence
that
of
users
think
like
programmers
bankers
financial
analysts
structural
engineers
these
are
all
people
whose
work
you
could
characterize
as
primarily
symbol
manipulation
but
what
they
do
is
not
programming
and
programming
is
not
required
to
do
what
they
do
to
restate
my
previous
point
yes
users
want
to
build
their
own
solutions
no
they
do
not
want

i

i

on

ive
also
done

examination

i
like
viewhs
abstractions
best
of
all
of
the
toolkits
i
mentioned
but
the
resulting
code
looks
little
like
motif
and
i
have
little
confidence
that
this
software
will
catch
on
or
otherwise
result
in
significant
longevity
for
my
code
gina
allows
you
to
write
code
which
looks
a
great
deal
like
motif
and
also
makes
interesting
use
of
inheritance
but
the
resulting
code
is
almost
too
motiflike
and
is
certainly
not
significantly
less
verbose
than
equivalent
c
code
interviews
looks
promising
but
i
havent
found
a
free
version
with
motif
support
and
im
not
confident
how
widely
interviews
with
motif
support
will
be
adopted
and
what
if
any
specific
motif
support
will
be
available
over
time
the
other
libraries
produce
code
which
is
less
motiflike
but
which
does
not
make
sufficient
use
of
the
features
of
c
to
simplify
my
coding
task
at
this
point
my
inclination
is
to
write
my
motif
manipulation
routines
in
c
and
invoke
those
routines
from
my
c
code
using
simple
abstractions
suited
to
my
specific
task
later
if
osf
or
some
credible
standardssetting
body
comes
up
with
a
c
interface
to
motif
i
will
change
to
that
it
does
me
no
goo
to
write
in
c
if
my
choice
of
interfaces
leaves
me
with
code
which
leaves
me
tied
to
an
abstraction
which
is
not
consistent
with
the
industry
directions
its
better
to
take
a
standard
if
inferior
solution
for
now
than
to
go
with
a
slgihtly
superior
approach
which
will
leave
me
with
both
useless
code
and
useless
skills
a

only

consider
right
now

in

wed
end
up
spending
nearly
to
use
it
and
i
cant
justify
it
when
its
likely
to
cause
shortterm
productivity
decreases
as
we
learn
the

abstraction
and
is
unlikely
to
be

my
impression
is
that
most
people
use

because
their

supplies
it
with

excluded

because
it
is
similar
in
look

to
mswindows
and
pm
personally
i
also
prefer
the
look

no

seeing

has

ibm

cant

in

im
sure
youll
see
it
on
virtually
every

ie
sun
ibm
hp
and
dec
must
make
up
the
vast

of
all
hardware
i
am
also
concerned
by
this
prevalence
of
motif
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
writing
and
obtaining
free
software
as
the
linux
and
communities
grow
however
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
its
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommercial
marketplace
ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is

for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
side
note
all
the
x
based
code
i
am
writing
and
will
distribute
freely
when
completed
is
based

from

my

how

out

people
can
ask
questions
about
motif
swap
stories

give

for

this
would
benefit
the

as
give

would
like

see
added

still

say

bambikirkbuozau

writes
i
am
also
concerned
by
this
prevalence
of
motif
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
writing
and
obtaining
free
software
as
the
linux
and
communities
grow
however
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
its
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommercial
marketplace
ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is
cost
recovery
for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
active
linux
and
communities
are
populated
by
enthusiasts
who
would
object
to
paying
any
money
for
software
otherwise
they
would
probably
have
gone
for
a
commercial
unix
an
important
factor
in
the
linux
community
is
that
source
code
is
always
available
this
is
probably
similar
in
the
community
however
im
not
really
involved
there
many
people
using
linux
like
to
stay
at
the
cutting
bleeding
edge
ie
when
kernel
patches
c
library
or
compiler
patches
come
out
people
like
to
rebuild
their
entire
systems
the
prime
requirement
for
all
linux
software
is
that
it
is
available
under
a
gnu
style
public
license
hence
linux
software
uses
either
the
athena
widgets
or
xview
individuals
may
write
software
requiring
motif
but
i
doubt
it
is
widely
adopted

the

does
the

hardware
cursor

or
does
the

generate
a

cursor
you
can
generally
tell
the
difference
just
by
using
it
if
the
cursor
blinks
a
lot
when
theres
screen
activity
its
probably
a
software
cursor
if
it
has
a
hardware
cursor
i
think
youre
probably
battling
a
bug
in

server
im
not
familiar
with
any
hardware
cursor
chips
that
display
cursors
greater
than

quite
possible
that
the

is
just
echoing
your
preferred
cursor
size
without
actually
checking
it
i
vaguely
recall
that

yes

i
cannot

whatever
x

the
motif
port
was
compiled
against
at

with
older
versions
of
motif
i
have
been
told
that
motif
can
be
used
with
any
x
but
i
have
not
seen
it
myself
currently
i
have
running
on
eight
different
unix
platforms
of
which
only
three
came
with
motif
on
those
three
i
am
unable

i

any

running

is
not
a

multiscreen

would
if
taken
strictly

different

since
the
strict
meaning

multidisplay
would
refer
to
a

with
multiple

when
its

it
probably
refers
to
the

multiscreen
would

uses

which
is
in

guide
from
o
reilly
one
can
read
in
the
section
about
xcteatewindow
something
like
in
the
current
implementation
of
when
using
a
visual
other
than
the
parents
be
sure
to
create
or
find
a
suitable
colourmap
which
is
to
be
used
in
the
window
attributes
when
creating
or
else
a
badmatch
occurs
this
warning
strangely
enough
is
only
mentioned
in
the
newer
editions
of
the
guides
it
applies
with
equal
force
to
earlier
versions
presumably
only
recently
did
the
authors
decide
it
was
important
enough
to
mention
the
necessity
it
refers
to
has
always
been
there
but
its
been
implicit
in
the
way
createwindow
requests
default
some
attributes
of
the
new
window
however
even
if
i
pass
along
a
suitable
colourmap
i
still
get
a

copyfromparent
border

this
is
because
the
warning
you
read
is
incomplete
you
have
to
provide
not
only
a
colormap
but
also
a
border
the
default
border
is
copyfromparent
which
is
not
valid
when
the
windows
depth
doesnt
match
its
parents
specify
a
borderpixmap
of
the
correct
depth
or
a
borderpixel
and
the
problem
should
go
away
there
is
another
problem
i
cant
find
anything
to
indicate
that
copyfromparent
makes
any
sense
as
the
borderwidth
parameter
to
xcreatewindow
your
xlib
implementation
probably
defines
copyfromparent
as
zero
to
simplify
the
conversion
to
wire
format
so
you
are
unwittingly
asking
for
a
border
width
of
zero
due
to
the
xlib
implementation
not
providing
stricter
typechecking
to
be
fair

i
would

skipping
olwm

this

i
happily

resulted

about
an

of
how
is
the

i
want
to
move
the

from
one
screendisplay
to
another
as
to
how
many

may
be

a

i
believe
the
limit
would
be
how
much
memory
is
available
to
your
server
or
allocated
by
the
server
this
all
sounds
suspiciously
like
my
company
might
have
something
to
do
with
this
background
first
megatek
has
a
series
of
framebuffers
designed
as
x
accelerators
for
the
most
part
these
are
designed
for
sun
sbus
and
sun
and
other
vendors
vme
systems
that
said
megatek
products
support
multiscreen
andor
multidisplay
on
a
sigle
workstation
most
of
our
cards
have
a
keyboardmouse
port
which
can
be
used
to
provide
additional
displays
for
example
say
you
hade
a
sparcstation
with
an
sbus
expansion
chassis
you
could
put
in
six
frambuffers
allowing
a
total
of
six
screens
in
the
system
you
could
then
attach
from
to
keyboardmice
allowing
you
to
mix
and
match
any
combination
of
screens
and
displays
you
could
have
display
displays
displays
or
display
and
display
basically
any
combination
because
of
this
we
at
megatek
try
to
be
very
careful
about
the
use
of
the
words
multiscreen
and
multidisplay
they
are
quite
different
in
meaning
and
at
least
in
x
have
exact
definitions
the
reason
i
ramble
like
this
is
the
mention
of
an
upper
limit
if
screens
in
a
display
as
it
so
happens
theres
a
define
in
the
server
that
determines
the
most
screens
supported
serverincludemisch
maxscreens
as
released
my
mit
this
is
as
released
by
megatek
this
is
as
such
the
most
screens
supported
by
a
single
megatek
display
ie
x
server
is
if
someone
construed
this
to
be
a
limitation
of
x
im
sorry
but
clearly
as
pointed
out
so
well
by
mr
neto
this
is
not
the
case
we
just
did
it
here

nobody

re

heres
what
i
think
have
figured
out
all
i
need
to
do
is
install
the
disitribution
without
the
xserver
like
the
sonycf
file
defines
and
all
the
new
libraries
utils
etc
will
be
installed
and
my
old
server
from

still
work
this
will
allow
me
to
run
xview
and
have
up
and
running
does
the
server
interface
remain
the
same
with
all
changes
made
only
to
the

another
question
is
it
likely
that
since
sun
is
dropping
ow
support
that
the
desktop
utils
like
the
file
manager
will
be
made
public
it
would
be
nice
if

would
make

xterm

forgive
me
if
this
is
a
faq
i
have
checked
the
list
but
i
cant
find
it
i
have
a
problem
with
the
cursor
within
xterm
on
mono
not
grayscale
monitors
the
problem
is
that
when
i
have
an
character
application
that
displays
input
fields
in
reverse
video
the
xterm
text
cursor
gets
lost
on
the
edge
of
the
input
field
the
solution
would
appear
to
be
to
set
the
xterm
cursor
to
a
line
rather
than
a
block
but
how
do
you
do
this
i
cant
find
any
means
although
various
sources
seem
to
indicate
it
can
be
done
when
the
xterm
loses
the
input
focus
the
cursor
becomes
an
outlined
block
this
would
also
be
preferable
but
i
cant
seem
to
force
this
to
be
the
default

table

trouble
with
xtquerygeometry
contentsproblems
with
table
widgets
in
the
following
part
of
a
program
an
user
interface
for
a
simulation
system
did
work
in
but
refused
to
in
of
cause
the
did
not
know
about
the
xptablewidgetclass
we
used
tablewidgetclass
instead
caught
from
the
net
in
times
of
and
xptablechildposition
formerly
xttblposition
since
compiling
with
the
program
causes
a
zero
width
or
height
error
on
sparcstations
the
troubleshooter
is
the
recomputation
of
the
modelinittable
table
widget
though
its
childs
label
and
asciitext
widgets
exist
xtquerygeometry
returns
a
prefered
width
and
height
of
zero
thus
the
following
asignment
cannot
perform
anything
else
but
set
the
width
and
height
of
the
newly
created
widget
to
zero
no
wonder
xtpopup
or
xtmanage
child
create
zero
width
or
height
errors
dependent
on
whether
width
and
height
of
the
shell

are
set
in

not
question
does
anyone
know
why
xtquerygeometry
returns
so
low
prefered
values
when
working
on
table

or
perhaps
what
to
do
about
ill
be

you

suppose
you

a

this

clearly

instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the

in

let
the

handler
take
care
of
rendering
the

because
at

it

the
problem

that
is
my

what

i
am
curious
to
find
out
the
required

that
a

must
have
if
one
machine
running
dvx
is
supporting
multiple
users
clients
and
we
require
adequate
response
time
anyone
have
any
ideas
i
expect
the
limiting
factor
will
be
your
server
machine
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
example
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughly
people
using
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
boxes
novell
file
servers
and
each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given

before
you
started
seeing

again
this
time
from

bandwidth
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the

youre

im

usually
with

i
seem
to
have
no
control
over
the

it
appears
long
enough
to
keep
several

in

it
cannot
keep
even
the
maximum
value
set

as
i
understand
panelvaluedisplaylength
which
controls
number
of

to

doesnt
work
in

monthly
question
about
xcopyarea
and
expose
events
posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part

monthly
question
about
xcop
buzz
moschettibearcom
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
hmmm
clearly
depends
on
your
programming
model
it
is
not
at
all
forbidden
to
draw
outside
the
context
of
an
expose
event
certainly
any
internal
data
structures
should
be
maintained
such
that
the
visual
appearance
would
be
maintained
properly
whenever
an
expose
event
happens
to
be
generated
this
doesnt
preclude
drawing
immediately

if

it

but
has
happened
for
graphic
windows
and
with
some
motif
clients
i
expect
what
is
going
on
here
is
that
your
colormap
is
full
and
when
the
new

starts
up
it
cannot
add
the
colors
that
it
needs
to
the

it
therefore
has
to
pick

choose
from

this
makes
it
look
ugly
until
its

then
macx
changes
the

that
the

is
getting
the
exact
colors
it
wanted

now
other
applications
are
having
to
make
do

this
is
a

with

at

all

xservers
i
have
seen
when
the
demands
of
the
applications
exceed
the
size
of
the
colormap
my
solution
is
usually
to
avoid
colormapgreedy
apps
and
display
applications
where
color
is
just
icing
on

cake
in

re
monthly
question
about
xcopyarea
and
expose
events
posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part
of
the
window
that
contains
the
new
item
what
is
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
to
produce
this
behavior
if
i
understand
your
problem
correctly
you
want
to
have
a
way
to
send
exposures
to
your
manager
widget
when
your
appspecific
code
draws
xlib
graphics
on
the
window
it
sounds
like
you
might
want
to
send
an
exposure
using
xsendevent
and
specifying
a
region
if
you
know
the
region
you
need
to
send
the
exposure
generally
you
have
the
bounding
rectangle
of
the
objects
you
can
use
xcreateregion
to
create
a
region
xunionrectwithregion
to
add
the
new
object
polygons
to
the
region
and
then
either
use
the
region
to
clip
your
gc
for
the
redraw
or
use
xrectinregion
to
test
which
of
your
other
objects
need
to
be
redrawn
keeping
in
mind
that
the
stacking
order
of
overlapping
objects
affects
how
they
look
hope
it
helps

does

work

a

of

hanging
off
the

also
running

presently
i
am
using
xdm
for
the
login
procedure
on
the
xterminals
using
tcpip
since
xdm
is
basically
just
an
xwindows
client
shouldnt
i
be
able
to
run
xdm
on
the
decnet
protocol
tower
as
well
my
first
inclination
is
that
xdm
is
not
your
typical
x
client
it
is
making
tcpip
specific
socket
calls
in
this
case
the
answer
would
be
no
you
can
not
run
xdm
over
decnet
is
this
right
or
not
any
feedback
is
appreciated

gcc

it

that
this

more
of
a

question
because
i
got
it
to
compile
without

there
are
a

the

procedure
is
set
up
with
the

but
in
several
places
in
the

code
they
reference
the
insertchild
procedure
and
pass
it
multiple
arguments
instead
of
just
one
as
the
prototype
suggests
for
example
superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw
args
pnumargs
now
gcc
chokes
on
this
giving
an

that
too
many
arguments
are

does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
as

how
to
turn
off

checking
in

how
i
can
go

the

that

opens

most

is
this
true
the

does

have
the

of

i
think
gl
is
a

posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part
of
the
window
that
contains
the
new
item
what
is
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
to
produce
this
behavior
to
incrementally
update
the
contents
of
windows
i
use
the
following
trick
set
the
window
background
to
none
call
xclearareadisplay
window
true
restore
the
window
background
to
its
correct
value
the
call
to
xcleararea
does
not
repaint
the
window
background
but
still
generates
exposure
events
for
visible
parts
of
the
window
in
order
to
let
my
application
know
that
these
expose
events
must
be
handled
incrementally
something
is
already
displayed
on
the
screen
and
may
need
to
be
erased
i
encapsulate
the
operations
with

actually
i

ask
the

most

what
does
this
have
to
do
with
my

i
previously
stated
that
i
did
an
xcopyarea
of
the

to
the

just
to
make
sure
that
my

had
data
and
it
did
this
is
not
a

with

it
has
to
do
with
xcopyplane
not
working
does
anyone
have
a
code
fragment
they
could
send
demonstrating
that
xcopyplane
works
this
would
be
very
helpful
thanks
what
it
has
to
do
with
your
original

is
this
many
times
beginning
x
users
heck
experienced
x
users
too
write
small
test
programs
many

they
forget
to
draw
only
in
response
to
expose

and
thus
see
unpreditable
results
whereby
sometimes
the
applications
graphics
show
up
and
sometimes
they
dont
were
just
trying
to
eliminate
all
the
easy
explanations
for
why
youre
not
seeing
your
graphics
that
being
said
why
dont
you
try
copying
different
planes
to
your
window
other
than
try
to
see
it
you
get
any
output
since
youre
dipslaying
only
a
single
plane
of
your

its
possible
that
all

been

are
getting
properly
connected

their
designated
color
maps
but
on
others
an
iris
also
a
different
entry
level
indigo
the
color
mapping
is
unreliable
and
changes
behavior
when
i
compile
at
different
times
the
most
common
problem
is
that
all
nontoplevel
windows
fail
to
be
displayed
according
to
their

my

starts
out
by
creating
three
toplevel

in
some

all
but
the
first
of
these
also
fail
to
be
displayed
by
their
colormap
this
is
spectacularly
aggravating
i
would
dearly
appreciate
an
explanation
of
the
standard
right
correct
way
to
give
a

a

such
that

locks

if

am

the

works
fine
soon
as
i
try

startx
again
the
screen
changes
modes
but
the
grey
background
pattern
does
not
come
up
and
no
xterm
is
forked
i
have
to
login
from
another

and
execute
a

to
reset
the

ive
contacted
esix
about
this
problem
they
claim
their
xwindow
server
which
i
have
works
with
the
wangtek
tape
drive
they
also
claim
i
only
need
the
nsu
network
system
utilities
to
run
x
i
dont
need
inet
tcpip
my
experience
has
been
that
i
need
both
to
get
to
work
im
not
too
concerned
about
having
to
load
both
nsu
and
inet
packages
to
get
x
to
work
unless
the
inet
package
is
causing
my
problem
i
would
like
to
get
both
x
and
my
tape
drive
to
coexist
on
the
same
system
if
you
can
shed
any
light
on
the
problem
it
would
be
appreciated
one
colleague
implied
this
might
be
a
hardware
conflict
if
this

true
what
direction
should

cursors
according
to
the
osfmotif
style
guide
one
should
use
cursor
shapes
to
give
the
user
a
visual
clue
of
what
is
happening
or
what
is
expected
of
him
so
a
hourglass
cursor
should
be
shown
when
the
application
is
busy
or
a
caution
cursor
should
be
shown
over
an
area
when
input
is
expected
in
another
defining
cursors
for
widgets
has
to
be
done
at
rather
low
level
so
defining
a
cursor
for
all
widgets
in
an
application
but
not
for
a
certain
subpart
of
it
is
a
rather
complicated
matter
when
cursors
have
been
defined
for
some
windows
eg
a
crosswire
cursor
for
a
drawingarea
things
get
even
more
complicated
my
intuition
says
that
things
should
be
easier
but
is
this
so
if
anyone
has
a
solid
and
complete
solution
to
my
problem
please
let
me
know
the
topics
on
busy
cursors
in
the
several
faqs
are
not

since
they
only
work
for

where

a

running

asked

recommendations
to
allow

many

for
all

the

recommended
pcxremote
from
ncd
i
received
it
yesterday
and
installed
it
on
my
sparc
and
pc
with
only
one
hitch
the
unix
install
consists
of
copying
files
into
some
local
bin
directory
on
the
pc
side
i
ordered
the
windows
version
which
came
with
a
slick
windows
installation
the
only
problem
i
had
was
that
my
xinitrc
in
my
home
directory
had
the
line
export
display
st
the
clients
i
kicked
off
connected
to
my
xserver
on
the
sparc
console
by
removing
this
line
from
the
xinitrc
everything
worked
as
planned
and
the
clients
connected
to
the
server
at
some
comments
on
performance
i
was
connected
to
a
sparc
thru
a
netblazer

over

my

xmail
was
very
usable
at

typed

was

xterm

shuffle
up
the
situation
running
a
fortran
executable
that
creats
an
xterm
an
option
in
the
menu
contained
in
the
xterm
runs
a
fortran
subroutine
that
creats
a

xterm
for
displaying
some
graphics
typing
a

while
the

xterm
future
reference
to
this
will
be
tekterm
is
active
makes
the
xterm
read
future
keystrokes
but
does
not
shift
input
focus
to
the
xterm
im
basing
that
statement
on
the
fact
that
the
border
of
the
tekterm
stays
the
highlighted
color
and
that
the
tekterm
stays
on
top
of
xterm
if
what
im
describing
isnt
input
focus
let
me
know
the
xterm
can
be
brought
to
the
top
by
clicking
the
mouse
button
on
it
subsequent
selections
from
the
xterm
of
the
menu
item
that
displays
graphics
highlihts
the
border
and
displays
the
updated
graphics
but
does
not
move
the
tekterm
to
the
top
if
the
tekterm
has
been
iconized
to
conserve
screen
space
it
stays
an
icon
the
desired
behavior
one
of
two
options
whichever
of
the
windows
that
is
active
is
always
on
top
of
the
inactive
one
whenever
the
tekterm
is
inactivated
it
should
revert
to
a
icon
but
when
it
is
activated
it
should
become
a
window
on
a
higher
level
than
the
xterm
what
i
think
i
need
a
means
of
specifying
that
a
xterm
or
tekterm
will
be
at
the
highest
level
and
a
way
to
iconifyexpand
a
xterm
and
tekterm
these
commands
would
id
guess
need
to
be
in
the
fortran
or
in
the
command
that
starts
up

you

there

it

it
is
similar
to

that

look
at

glxunlink
glxgetconfig

glxwinset
in

the

works
pretty
well
opengl
will
be
an
improvement
i
can
vouch
for
that
the

works
pretty
well
i
have
been
using
it
for
sometime
now
im
not
sure
though
whether
you
can
use
xlib

to
draw

i
havent

i
read

which
explains

does
pex

have
the

functionality
of

i
think
gl
is
a
little
easier
to
use
and
a
little
more
powerful
but
thats
just
an
opinion
mileage
may
vary
well
pex
is
designed
as
an
extension
to
x
and
will
be
more
seamless

then
it
is
buggy

with
sunview
becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from

this
was
on
a

ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
using
xputimage
your
source
is
maintained
by
the
client
and
the
destination
is
maintained
by
the

thus
you
incur
the
overhead
of
transporting

whatever

communications
mechanism
you
are
using
is
it
possible
for
you
to
maintain
your
source
images
in
pixmaps
these
are
maintained
by
the
server
so
copying
them
into
a
window
is
much
cheaper
also
make
sure
you
are
not
sending
any
unnecessary
xsyncs

running
in
xsynchonize
mode
if
you
need
speed

your
client
can
run

you
should

xquerybestcursor

some
one
asked
me
recently
why
they
when
they
used
xquerybestcursor
to
see
if
they
could
create
of
a
given
size
it
seemed
to
imply
they
could
but
the
server
did
not
create
cursors
of
that
size
investigation
showed
that
some
x
servers
will
happily
return
any
size
up
to
the
size
of
the
root
window
while
others
return
some
fixed
limit
of
more
reasonable
size
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
the
same
server
binary
acts
differently
on
different
hardware
a
with
a
will
claim
cursors
up
to
root
window
size
are
ok
while
a
with

far
ive
also
seen
this
behavior
on

and
have
been
told
it
also
occurs
on

actually
the
ncd
is
even
more
liberal
sizes
much
larger
then
the
root
winodw
are
gladly
returned
as

is

i
have
a

running

presently
i
am
using

on

using

just
an

shouldnt
i
be

to
run
xdm
on
the
decnet

tower
as
well
xdm
is
not
just
an

client
xdm
has
its
own
protocol
xdmcp
that
operates
of
ucp
on

it
does
provide
a
login
window
which
is
an

client
as
to
using
decnet
protocol
looking
through
the
source
for
xdm
from
that
i
have
here
it
seems
that
the
bare
bones
code
is
there
but
not
completely
there
my
first
inclination
is
that
xdm
is
not
your
typical
x
client
it
is
making
tcpip
specific
socket
calls
in
this
case
the
answer
would
be
no
you
can
not
run
xdm
over
decnet
is
this
right

not
any
feedback
is

on

i
am
trying
to
build

use
imake
on
an
ibm
running
aix
i
am
having
the
following
problems
many
of
my
imakefiles
have
contructs
like
this
is
a
makefile
at
the
start
of
lines
to
pass
makefile
comments
thru
the
c
preprocessor
and
into
the
makefile
most
of
the
c
preprocessors
that
i
have
used
will
not
treat
such
a
as
appearing
at
the
start
of
the
line
thus
the
c
preprocessor
does
not
treat
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
however
the
ibm
cpp
strips
the
comment
and
treats
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
the
cpp
fails
when
it
determines
that
this
is
not
a
known
directive
i
have
temporarily
hacked
my
imake
to
handle
this
situation
but
would
like
to
come
up
with
a
better
fix
several
imakefiles
use
as
a
parameter
to
a
macro
when
a
particular
use
of
the
macro
does
not
need
a
value
for
the
parameter
the
aix
cpp
gives
warnings
about
these
situations
but
continues
to
work
ok
if
you
are
familiar
with
these
problems
and
have
solutions
i
would
appreciate
information
about
on
your
solutions
perhaps
this
is
solved
in
a
later
version
of
imake
that
i
have
not
reviewed
also
do
you
know
of
other
cpps
that
behave
similarly
since
i
do
not
have
easy

xputimage

considerably
slower
factor

the

data

both

to

on

in
ora
vol
in
the
section
on

it
says
for
information
on
how
to
specify
translation
tables
see
vol
this
is
so
you
know
what
to
put
for
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
if
you
go
to
vol
it
says
likewise
if
a
modifier
is
specified
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
other
modifiers
from
being
present
as
well
for
example
the
translation
shiftkeyq
quit
will
take
effect
even
if
the
ctrl
key
is
held
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
shift
key
and
the
q
key
this
implies
to
me
that
setting
xmnaccelerator
to
ctrlkeyo
should
do
what
i
want
but
it
doesnt
it
doesnt
work
if
the
user
presses

the

is
it

considerably
slower
factor

the

moves

the

hi
im
new

group
so
please
bear
with
me
two
years
ago
i
wrote
a
sunview
application
for
fast
animation
of
raster
files
with
sunview
becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from
memory
pixrects
to
a
canvas
this
was
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
using
xputimage
your
source
is
maintained
by
the
client
and
the
destination
is
maintained
by
the
server
thus
you
incur
the
overhead
of
transporting
through
whatever
clientserver
communications
mechanism
you
are
using
is
it
possible
for
you
to
maintain
your
source
images
in
pixmaps
these
are
maintained
by
the
server
so
copying
them
into
a
window
is
much
cheaper
also
make
sure
you
are
not
sending
any
unnecessary
xsyncs

running
in

detecting

poseted

such
great
response
from
my
last
question
thanks
everyone
lets
try
again
how
can
i
tell
if
a
colorcell
is
readonly
i
want
to
use
any
readonly
cells
that
are
already
in
my
colormap
once
i
start
running
out
of
allocatable
cells
using
some
arbitrary
nearest
color
matching
scheme
to
get
those
cells
that
come
closest
to
a
requested
color
once
i
determine
if
a
cell
is
readonly
i
assume
i
can
then
just
request
an
xalloccolor
with
the
exact
same
color
specifications
and
it
will
then
be
flagged
as
used
by
my
application
so
that
it
doesnt
later
get
freed
by
someone
else
and
allocated
again
as
readwrite
to
another
application
so
far
the
only
way
ive
figured
out
to
do
this
is
to
write
my
own
error
handler
and
just
go
ahead
and
request
the
cells
colors
once
my
colormap
is
all
full
up
it
should
error
out
if
the
cell
is
nonshareable
but
life
would
be
much
easier
if
i
could
just
detect
the
readonlyshareable

question
regarding
overlaying
of
graphics
hello
i
wonder
if
some
one
can
suggest
an
answer
to
the
following
question
i
am
a
total
x
novice
and
would
appreciate
any
suggestions
you
may
have
i
am
trying
to
create
a
simple
drawing
tool
lets
say
i
have
two
rectangles
on
the
canvassee
above
one
intersecting
the
other
now
i
would
like
to
delete
one
of
the
rectangles
the
way
i
do
it
is
to
create
another
gc
wherein
i
use
the
gxxor
logical
function
and
simply
redraw
the
rectangle
using
the
newly
created
graphics
context
thus
deleting
it
for
all
apparent
purposes
a
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
at
the
points
of
intersection
the
pixel
locations
belonging
to
the
other
rectangle
also
become
white
which
is
something
that
should
be
avoided
is
there
any
way
i
can
avoid
this
problem
without
having
to
redraw
the
other
rectangle
too
i
also
would
not
like
to
generate
an
expose
event
for
the
affected
area
as
this
degrades
performance
very
badly
thank
you

animation
is
most
frequently
done
by

using
xputimage
once
this
is
done
the
original

can
be
performed
using

helpfull
john
i
just
implemented
this
and
it

i
can
just
about
achieve
the
display
rates
frames
sec
on
ipx
that
i
get
with
sunview
though
its
a
bit
choppy
at
times
also
loading
the
data
making
an
ximage
then
xputing
it
into
a
pixmap
is
a
bit
cumbersome
so
the
animation
is
slower
to
load
than
with
sunview
is
there
a
better
way
to
load
in
the

vanishing
font
problem
a

has

font
problem
on

workstation
when

first
logs
on
via
xdm
he
has
a
single
xterm
window
appear
with
the
mwm
window
manager
running
in
this
configuration
x
windows
applications
particularly
xdvi
work
fine
however
if
he
opens
up
a
second
xterm
application
suddenly
xdvi
cannot
start
in
either
window
giving
the
error
unable
to
load
iso
font
the
only
difference
between
the
two
xterm
windows
is
that
the
initial
one
references
a
different
name
in
the
xsession
file
with
prettier
colours
and
other
slight
changes
further
investigation
shows
that
only
opening
a
default
xterm
causes
this
behaviour

start

no

xlsfonts

a
strange
problem
with

hello
i
am
testing
a
port
of

coherent
a
unix
clone
os
for
intel
architecture
machines
i
am
seeing
a
strange
problem
with
text
in
clients
like
xvt
a
simple
terminal
emulator
program
the
problem
manifests
it
self
when
the
shell
echoes
typed
characters
back
to
the
server
for
display
one
at
a
time
the
characters
appear
to
be
too
closely
spaced
with
the
result
being
that
the
character
echoed
destroys
the
rightmost
edge
of
the
first
character
then
the
character
destroys
the
rightmost
edge
of
the
second
character
and
so
on
it
looks
like
there
is
an
invisible
boundary
around
a
character
which
obscures
a
portion
of
the
previous
character
there
is
no
problem
between
the
characters
when
the
shell
returns
a
complete
line
of
text
only
when
the
output
is
a
series
of
individual
characters
if
anyone
has
any
ideas
what
the
problem
might
be
or
where
i
should
look
to
find
it
it
would
be
much

now
we
have
another
bug
report
on
the

subject
can
anybody
help
me
out
the
problem
is
that
motif
uses
xgrabkey
to
implement
menu
accelerators
and
these
grabs
are
specific
about
which
modifiers
apply
unfortunately
the
specification
for
xgrabkey
doesnt
allow
anymodifier
to
be
combined
with
other
modifiers
which
is
exactly
what
would
be
desired
in
this
case
ctrl
anykeyq
in
ora
vol
in
the
section
on
accelerators
it
says
for
information
on
how
to
specify
translation
tables
see
vol
this
is
so
you
know
what
to
put
for
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
if
you
go
to
vol
it
says
likewise
if
a
modifier
is
specified
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
other
modifiers
from
being
present
as
well
for
example
the
translation
shiftkeyq
quit
will
take
effect
even
if
the
ctrl
key
is
held
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
shift
key
and
the
q
key
this
is
true
for
accelerators
and
mnemonics
which
are
implemented
using
event
handlers
instead
of
grabs
its
not
true
for
menu
accelerators
if
youre
a
motif
implementor
id
suggest
lobbying
to
get
the
xlib
semantics
changed
to
support
the
feature
i
described
above
otherwise
change
the
documentation
for
menu
accelerators
to
properly
set
the
users
expectations
because
menu
accelerators
are
not
the
same
thing
as
translations
is
it
possible
to
supply
accelerator
for
a
menu
entry
if
you
mean
menu
accelerator
no
its
not
possible
thats
according
to
the
definition
of
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
in
the
xmlabel
manual
page
keep
in
mind
when
answering
this
question
that
when
using
motif
you
cant
use
xtinstallaccelerators
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
not
how
can
you
ensure
that
accelerators
work
the
same
independent
of
case
what
i
want
is
ctrlo
and
ctrlo
to
both
be
accelerators
on
one
menu
entry
there
is
a
workaround
for
motif
users
in
addition
to
the
normal
menu
accelerator
you
install
on
the
xmpushbuttongadget
set
an
xtnaccelerators
resource
on
the
shell
toplevel
or
application
install
the

theres

how
to

in

actually
i
just
finished
writing
a
motif
animation
program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast
when
using
onserver
pixmaps

i
had
to
insert
a
delay
loop
to
keep
it
from
going
too
quickly
testing
both
methods
side
by
side
they
were
just
about
equal
the
advantage
of
shm
is
that
your
x
server
doesnt
grow
to
ridiculous
sizes
but
pixmaps
can
work
over
a
network
and
are
removed
if
your
application
dies
one
tends
to
use
ipcrm
manually
quite
a
bit
when
debugging
shm
apps
shared
memory
also
has
the
problem
that
some
operating
systems
eg
ultrix
seem
to
allow
only
a
small
number
of
segments
to
be
attached
to
a
process
at
once
consequently
a
redraw
becomes
xshmattachxshmputimagexshmdetach
on
dec
systems
and
decs
bit
displays
like
the
ones
i
tend
to
use
most
often
dont
seem
to
support
the
extension
maybe
someone
compiled
them
wrong
and
using
pixmaps
causes
the
x
server
to
crash
failed
mallocs
so
one
has
to
use
the
local
unix
domain
socket
which
really
isnt
that
bad
one
copies
the
info
three
times
per
redraw
instead
of
one
in
short
allowing
all
three
forms
of
display
within
the
program
is
a
good
thing
minus
shm
if
running
over
a
network

feels

break
and
similarly
for

jright
and

of

you

have
to
define

forth

i

to

me
to
some

this

likely
to
give
better
results
than

pixmaps
id
also
be
interested
in
looking
at
the
xview
code
mentioned
above
there
is
no
easy
answer
to
this
question
it
depends
on
whether
the
display
device
can
hold
pixmaps
in
offscreen
memory
and
if
so
how
efficiently
the
server
manages
these
resources
having
to
deal
with
limited
offscreen
memory
is
the
bane
of
the
server
implementors
existence
i
have
worked
with
graphics
devices
where
the
offscreen
memory
to
main
display
copy
rate
eclipses
that
of
the
main
memory
to
display
copy
rate
and
with
those
where
the
main
memory
to
display
is
faster
than
offscreen
to
display
requires
only
a
write
to
the
framebuffer
rather
than
a
read
of
the
fb
followed
by
a
write
if
your
server
uses
the
cfb
code
or
something
like
it
to
render
into
pixmaps
in
cpu
main
memory
the
rates
you
can
get
through
mitshm
are
likely
to
be
equal
maybe
a
tad
slower
depending
on
your
oss
implementation
of
shared
memory
to
copyarea
from
pixmap
to
window
which
is
also
then
just
a
copy
from
cpu
main
memory
to
graphics
device
one
advanage
of
mitshm
is
that
if
your
images
are
large
you
dont
end
up
growing
the
size
of
the
server
process
to
hold
them
one
disadvantage
of
the
mitshm
is
that
in
its

there
is
no

cleaning

help

my

was
to
load
only
the
neccessary

to
boot
the

this
resulted
in
not
loading
openwindows
as
a

of

none

got
loaded
i
am
trying

load

required
for
running

written

i
retrieved

is
this
enough
for

i
did

these

misc
when
i
run

the

says

but
the

is
i
cannot
load

are
there
any

can
anybody
help

out
the
problem
is
that
motif
uses
xgrabkey
to
implement
menu
accelerators
and
these
grabs
are
specific
about
which
modifiers
apply
unfortunately
the
specification
for
xgrabkey
doesnt
allow
anymodifier
to
be
combined
with
other
modifiers
which
is
exactly
what
would
be
desired
in
this
case
ctrl
anykeyq
in
ora
vol
in
the
section
on
accelerators
it
says
for
information
on
how
to
specify
translation
tables
see
vol
this
is
so
you
know
what
to
put
for
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
if
you
go
to
vol
it
says
likewise
if
a
modifier
is
specified
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
other
modifiers
from
being
present
as
well
for
example
the
translation
shiftkeyq
quit
will
take
effect
even
if
the
ctrl
key
is
held
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
shift
key
and
the
q
key
this
is
true
for
accelerators
and
mnemonics
which
are
implemented
using
event
handlers
instead
of
grabs
its
not
true
for
menu
accelerators
if
youre
a
motif
implementor
id
suggest
lobbying
to
get
the
xlib
semantics
changed
to
support
the
feature
i
described
above
otherwise
change
the
documentation
for
menu
accelerators
to
properly
set
the
users
expectations
because
menu
accelerators
are
not
the
same
thing
as
translations
is
it
possible
to
supply
accelerator
for
a
menu
entry
if
you
mean
menu
accelerator
no
its
not
possible
thats
according
to
the
definition
of
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
in
the
xmlabel
manual
page
keep
in
mind
when
answering
this
question
that
when
using
motif
you
cant
use
xtinstallaccelerators
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
not
how
can
you
ensure
that
accelerators
work
the
same
independent
of
case
what
i
want
is
ctrlo
and
ctrlo
to
both
be
accelerators
on
one
menu
entry
i
find
this
thread
on
motif
accelerators
absoultly
amazing
if
i
were
writing
an
interface
to
keyboard
accelerators
i
would
have
one
resource
called
accelerators
that
took
a
translation
table
period
i
would
also
implement
it
so
that
programmer
never
has
to
do
any
work
to
get
the
accelerators
installed
as
soon
as
the
enduser
specified
one
it
would
be
active
and
automatically
installed
to
get
multiple
accelerators
on
a
single
menu
item
id
do
something
like
menuitemaccelerators
override
n
ctrlkeym
fire
n
shiftkeyl
fire
n
the
accelerators
would
work
exactly
like
translations
and
you
would
automatically
see
a
ctrl
m
show

in

in

re
question
regarding
overlaying
of
graphics
lets
say
i
have
two
rectangles
on
the
canvassee
above
one
intersecting
the
other
now
i
would
like
to
delete
one
of
the
rectangles
the
way
i
do
it
is
to
create
another
gc
wherein
i
use
the
gxxor
logical
function
and
simply
redraw
the
rectangle
using
the
newly
created
graphics
context
thus
deleting
it
for
all
apparent
purposes
a
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
at
the
points
of
intersection
the
pixel
locations
belonging
to
the
other
rectangle
also
become
white
which
is
something
that
should
be
avoided
you
could
set
up
a
bitmap
with
a
mask
in
it
clear
the
bitmap
draw
the
rectangle
to
be
deleted
with
gxor
draw
the
one
that
is
to
stay
with
gxclear
then
gxxor
the
entire
pixmap
with
the
screen
note
that
this
is
a
pretty
effective
way
of
animation
if
you
ever
need
to
do
that
replace
the
gxclear
with
a
gxxor

lots

im

what
youre

you

by
placing
several

within

putting

within

this
wouldnt
be
good
for
very
large

but
you
might
consider
this
as
an
alternative
alternatively
if
anyone
has
a
multicolumn

widget
they
could
sell

this
might
save

from

simply

i
quite

you
can
actually
use

ever
touch

stuff
delete

there
should

is

i

hear

i
agree
completely
one
thing
i
cant
stand
about
the

is
its
shear
determination

if

like

handy

moving

but
for
most
work
the
keyboard

hot

are
times
faster
than
using
the
mouse
sure
it
is
a
plus
to
be
able
to
do
something
simple
if
you
are
an
inexperienced

how
long
is
it
before

i
dont

it
is
too
much
to
ask
that

programmers
provide
not
only
a
menumouse
interface
but
also
look
forward
to
those
who
would
like
to
move

usually
allows

on

i
am
trying
to
build

use
imake
on
an

running
aix
i
am
having
the
following
problems
many
of
my
imakefiles
have
contructs
like
this
is
a
makefile
at
the
start
of
lines
to
pass
makefile
comments
thru
the
c
preprocessor
and
into
the
makefile
most
of
the
c
preprocessors
that
i
have
used
will
not
treat
such
a
as
appearing
at
the
start
of
the
line
thus
the
c
preprocessor
does
not
treat
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
however
the
ibm
cpp
strips
the
comment
and
treats
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
the
cpp
fails
when
it
determines
that
this
is
not
a
known
directive
i
have
temporarily
hacked
my
imake
to
handle
this
situation

would
like
to
come
up
with
a
better
fix

when
a

does

the
aix

gives
warnings
about
these

but
continues

work
ok
if
you

lockmask
is
the
one
for

unfortunately
it

how
does

tell

which
are
for

sgis
vendor

has

numlock
whereas
solaris
openwindows
has
for

is
there
an
unambiguous
means
of
determining
numlocks
mask
at

for
any

server
sorry
for
the
wasted
bandwidth
and
my
appalling
ignorance
youll
have
to
check
the
keysyms
on
each
of
the
keys
for
each
modifier
the
one
with
numlock
in
its
mapping
is
the
modifier
you
want
a
bit
ugly
perhaps
but
i
think
its
currently
the
only
way
to
do
this
and
it
does
have
some
precedent
as
keysyms
are
used
to
differentiate
capslock
from
shiftlock
for
the
lock
modifier
i
dont
know
of
an
accepted
strategy
for
handling
ambiguous
assignments
either
ie
what
if
numlock
is
mapped
for
more
then
one
modifier
i
suppose
first

is

that
i

can
someone
help
me
unfortunately
the
key
event
handling
is
pretty
much
hardwired
into
emacs
i
ran
into
this
problem
a
while
back
my
solution
was
to
change
the
source
code
so
that
all
of
these
special
keys
generated
character
sequences
which
basically
encoded
the
keysym
and
modifier
state
as
escape
sequences
for
example
the
sequence
esc
b
would
indicate
that
the
home
key
was
pressed
with
the
shift
key
down
you
could
also
detect
standard
keys
with
odd
modifiers
such
as
shiftreturn
if
anybody
wants
these
changes
theyre
welcome
to
them
but
youll
have
to
have
the
source
available
and
be
comfortable
munging
with
it
a
bit
basically
you
have
to
replace
the
keypress
handling
code
in
the
source
file
maybe
if
someone
at
osf
is
interested
i
can
send
them
the
tweaks
but
i
imagine
theyve
got
bigger
fish
to
fry
hopefully
including
the
much
talked
about
emacs
if
theres
sufficient
interest
ill
post
the
mods
somewhere
although
this
probably
isnt
the
appropriate
group
for
it
notes
this
special
code
will
only
apply
if
you
let
emacs
create
its
own
window
if
you
run
it
in
plain
old
tty
mode
which
includes
xterm
windows

its

as

apologies
if

our

has

a

of
articles
lately
so
i
havent
seen
the
faq
lately
to
check
two
ways
when
you
start
the

you
can
use
command
line
options
n
iconname
to
set
the
icon
label
t
windowtitle
to
set
the
window
title
title
windowtitle
equivalent
to
t
windowtitle
you
can
use
escape
sequences
to
change
things
on
the
fly
the
basic
escape
sequence
is
esc
p
somearbitarytext
bel
where
esc
and
bel
are
the
ascii
escape
and
bell
characters
p
is
an
ascii
decimal
digit
or
depending
on
whether
you
are
trying
to
set
the
window
or
icon
title
or
both
and
somearbitarytext
is
your
desired
label
string
hence
this
command
will
set
the
window
icon
title
echo
to
set
just
the
icon
title
echo
to
set
just
the
window
title
echo
of
course
you
may
have
to
fiddle
with
exact
syntax
depending
on
how
the
echo
command
works
on
your
system
and
what
shell
you
are
using
ive
shown
systemv
semantics
under
bourne
or
korn
shells
hint
for
sun
os
users
use
instead
of
binecho
or
cshs
builtin
echo
otherwise
youll
have
to
embed
literal
esc
and
bel
characters
in
the
string
instead
of
using
convenient
octal
sequences
if
you
want
your
titlebar
updated
continously
say
to
show
your
current
directory
hostname
or
somesuch
then
youll
have
to
see
if
you

when

from

by
calling
getvalue

only
using
setvalue
if
the
required
location
is
different
the
problem
can
also
be
avoided
by
making
a
tiny
alteration
in
the
location
of
the

so
that
the
setvalue
really
does
change
the

this
just
for

the

we

are

use
twm

olwm
use
olwm
with

wmtimeout
only
reset

overriding
window
manager
focus
processing
i
am
working
on
an
xwindow
based
application
that
needs
to
override
some
of
the
window
manager
focus
processing
i
am
using
and
motif
currently
although
i
will
also
be
working
with
open
look
in
the
future
what
i
need
to
do
is
under
certain
circumstances
prevent
the
user
from
switching
from
one
window
of
the
application
to
another
window
lets
say
for
example
that
window
a
is
on
top
of
window
b
in
the
window
hierarchy
normally
if
the
user
clicks
the
mouse
in
window
b
it
will
be
brought
to
the
top
of
the
window
hierarchy
and
placed
on
top
of
window
a
under
certain
circumstances
if
the
user
clicks
the
mouse
in
window
b
i
need
to
beep
and
prevent
window
b
from
being
raised
on
top
of
window
a
from
the
research
and
testing
ive
done
so
far
it
appears
that
this
window
ordering
is
handled
by
the
window
manager
in
this
case
motif
i
havent
found
any
way
to
override
this
default
processing
through
standard
x
window
functions
i
can
tell
when
this
switching
occurs
through
focus
change
and
mapping
notify
events
but
i
cant
find
any
way
to
tell
motif
not
to
make
the
switch
the
temporary
solution
ive
currently
come
up
with
is
very
kludgy
but
it
partially
works
when
i
detect
such
a
window
switch
in
those
cases
when
the
switch
is
not
allowed
i
manually
force
the
formerly
top
window
back
on
top
with
an
xraisewindow
call
and
beep
with
the
xbell
function
this
provides
the
necessary
functionality
but
looks
ugly
when
the
windows
switch
places
twice
does
anyone
know
how
i
can
tell
motif
or
preferably
any
window
manager
when
i
dont
want
the
window
order
switch
to
actually
take
place

use

remember
the

the

focus
follows
the

since
the

mwm
wont

so
it
wont
allow

either
since
it
sounds
as
though
you

keyboardfocuspolicypointer
i
suggest
you
set
colormapfocuspolicypointer
also
that
way
the
cmap
focus
wont
slavishly
follow
keyboard
focus
but
will
beat
its
own
path
if
you
have
keyboardfocuspolicy
explicit
you
can
set

explicit
also

a

periodically
hang
when

xnews
the

displayed
but
then
no

have
any
effect
sometimes
pressing
return
will
unstick
the
application
but
not
usually
it
looks
like
the
pulldown
is
grabbing
the
focus
and
never
letting
go
other
windows
on
the
display
continue
to
get
updated
so
the
server
isnt
hanging
if
i
log
in

kill

everything
gets

patch
using

applying
the

specified

faq
question
this

the

of

as

to
the

and
screwing
up

mnemonics

it
did
seem
to
help
but
i
was
still
able
to
get
the

repeat
by
this
is
an
intermittent

so
youll
have
to
try
several

much
its

hear

i

completely
one
thing
i
cant
stand
about
the

its

like
the

moving

but
for
most
work
the

are
times
faster
than
using
the

sure
it
is
a
plus
to
be
able
to
do
something
simple

how
long
is
it
before
your
are

a

two
speaking

at

i
dont
think
it
is
too
much
to
ask
that
window
programmers
provide
not
only
a
menumouse
interface
but
also
look
forward
to
those
who
would
like
to
move
on
to
hot

command

interfaces
which
usually
allows
you
to
do
more

less
time
if

all
of
the
above
equally
applies
to

got

tcpview
a
motifbased
tcpip
protocol
analyzer
tcpview
is
the
result
of
several
problems
we
had
at
uw
we
have
several
network
general
sniffers
which
are
heavily
used
to
help
debug
problems
on
several
hundred
subnets
these
are
good
tools
but
they
are
heavy
hard
to
find
when
you
need
one
limited
in
their
software
expandibility
difficult
to
use
to
upload
data
for
analysis
cannot
be
remotely
operated
and
cannot
resolve
names
with
dns
requiring
much
manual
manipulation
of
the
name
table
we
also
sometimes
use
tcpdump
but
we
found
it
too
difficult
for
most
people
did
not
have
enough
information
for
many
protocols
could
not
be
used
interactively
could
not
handle
tcp
streams
and
could
not
read
sniffer
files
however
tcpdump
did
do
a
reasonable
job
of
decoding
a
large
number
of
protocols
and
could
be
easily
modified
tcpview
is
an
attempt
to
resolve
these
problems
by
adding
a
motif
interface
to
tcpdump
and
expanding
its
features
tcpview
has
been
tested
on
a
decstation

sun
under
ultrix

it
should
work
on
the

it
compiles
with

how
to
see
characterset
from
wchart
we
developed
a
toolkit
running
on
the
x
window
system
the
toolkit
copes
with
any
languages
based
on
facility
as
you
know
there
are
kinds
of
implementation
from
mits
release
xsi
and
ximp
our
original
implementation
of
the
toolkit
uses
xsi
our
toolkit
manages
each
characters
size
based
on
our
own
font
management
system
in
order
to
do
that
the
wchart
typed
character
strings
must
be
decomposed
to
character
sets
this
means
that
if
one
wchart
type
compound
string
with
ascii
and
kanji
mixed
for
example
is
given
each
element
of
the
wchart
array
must
be
checked
its
corresponding
character
set
based
on
a
bit
layout
and
application
environments
locale
in
this
case
if
the
locale
is
japanese
each
wchart
character
will
be
classified
either
to
or
so
we
need
a
function
to
do
this
the
function
must
check
how
many
characters
from
the
top
are
the
same
character
set
and
what
the
character
set
is
we
could
not
find
any
public
function
to
do
that
and
inevitably
used
xsis
internal
functions
to
construct
that
function
the
following

that
function

a
serious
issue
occured
when
we
tried
to
compile
a

application

machine
with

version
of

tried

occured
saying

the

xmbctidtocsid

xmbfscs
code
xwcdecomposeglyphcharset
code
xfallbackconvert
code
we
had
used
mit
release
version
of
and
its
xsi
implementation
until
and
ran
applications
successfully
one
of
the
reasons
to
use
xsi
was
that
because
hp
did
not
release
hps
until
the
os
and
we
had
no
way
to
know
how
hps
would
be
implemented
we
had
hoped
xsis
popularity
and
used
its
internal
functions
the
hps
linker
complains
that
there
are
no
xsi
internal
functions
implemented
we
observe
from
hps
they
used
some
ximp
implementation
but
we
are
not
sure
if
they
used
mits
vanilla
ximp
version
or
their
own
version
of
ximp
and
therefore
finding
just
counter
part
functions
in
mits
ximp
for
xsi
does
not
seem
to
lead
us
a
solution
my
question
and
goal
is
to
know
how
we
can
construct
a
function
like
decomposecharacterset
listed
above
is
there
any
function
to
check
character
set
of
each
element
of
wchart
type
strings
depending
on
locales
if
it
is
a
public
function
that
is
perfect
but
even
if
it
is
not
we
want
to
use
any
internal
functions
in
hps
as
we
did
for
mits
in
order
to
render
a
wchart
type
string
there
must
be
some
machinery
to
judge
character
sets
and
that
is
how
the
proper
fonts
are
selected
for
the
string
we
have
no
way
to
find
out
that
without
any
hps
source
files
we
want
to
know
how
we
can
use
that
for
our
goal
any
help
or
comments
would
be
highly
appreciated
i
also
appreciate
if
anyone
tell
me
about
ximp
treating
around
this
area
even
if
it
is
not
hps
implementation

would
be
to

running

over

i
wanted
to
get
some

i
wrote
a
small
xlib
program
which
simply
creates
a
window
maps
it
and
sends
the
first
expose
event
to
itself
the
program
times
the
delay
from
sending
the
event
to
receiving
it
i
thought
this
was
the
simplest
way
to
test
clientxserver
roundtrip
delays
its
a
similar
concept
to
the
program
is
this
a
valid
test
to
perform
ive
also
tried
the
xbench
program
available
from
ftpuunet
which
bombards
the
server
with

operations
but
i
just
wanted
to
get
a
quantative

is

either
the

carnegie

the

terms

not

thus
anyone

commercially
exploit

however
we
defer

what

give

note
the

you
can

on

by
changing

the

is

if

im
writing
an
x
server
for
some
videogeneration
equipment
the
hardware
is
truecolor
in
yuv
space
in
x
terms
it
has
a
static
color
visual
i
would
really
like
to
have
the
server
just
present
this
static
visual
but
im
not
sure
if
this
will
be
acceptable
to
most
x
clients
the
three
problems
i
see
are
the
colormap
though
huge
is
static
all
pixels
would
be
bytes
wide
because
the
hardware
actually
lives
in
yuv
space
the
translation
rgbyuv
will
introduce
some
rounding
error
we
tried
to
ship
an
x
server
once
that
only
supported
a
truecolor
visual
the
main
problems
we
encountered
were
clients
written
with
logic
like
the
following
if
defaultdepth
assume
default
depth
is
these
clients
need
an
deep
visual
in
the
root
window
to
run
correctly
other
clients
didnt
even
bother
to
do
that
much
and
just
outright
assumed
they
had
a
dynamic
visual
class
with
a
dynamic
colormap
xstorecolors
doesnt
work
on
cmaps
associated
with
static
or
truecolor
visual
classes
but
many
clients
dont
bother
to
check
they
just
start
throwing
xstorecolor
calls
at
you
though
both
are
clearly
client
error
this
is
the
case
with
so
many
clients
that
its
easier
for
you
to
expose
pseudocolor
as
a
default
root
window
visual
than
it
ever
would
be
for
all
these
client
writers
to
change
their
clients
to
do
the
right
thing

something
about

rags
if
they
cant
even
get
the
name
of

right
why
should
one
trust
anything
else
they
have
to
say
i
used
to
think
this
way
and
not
just
about
x
for
example
incorrect
english
constructs
such
as
its

annoy
me
however
there
comes
a
time
when

usage
starts
to
dictate
the
way
things
really
are
in
the
world
indeed
the
fact
that
x
won
out
over
news
was
really
down
to
popular
opinion
i
know
we
all
think
its
technically
superior
as
well
on
a
related
topic
who
is
to
say
that
color
is
more
or
less
correct
than
colour
being
irish
and
hence
using
english
english
as
opposed
to
american
english
i
always
use
the
latter
except
of
course
for
api
terms
such
as
xalloccolor
and
colormap
in
a
world
that
uses
the
term
windows
to
refer
to
microsoft
windows
perhaps
the
time
has
come
to
accept
x
windows
as
a
valid
term
for
x
i
think
that
this
is
a
more
concise
and
uncluttered
term
than
say
the
x
window
system
and
lets
face
it
almost
everyone
uses
it
ultimately
we
all
need
product
sales
to
more
than
just
xliterate
people
in
this
respect
product
recognition
is
important
and
a
short
snappy
descriptive
title
x
is
positively
obscure
will
help
when
dealing
with
the
average
punter
its
sad
i
thought
i
was
a
software
engineer
indeed
it
is
unfortunate
that
x
did
not
become
popularly
known
as
windows
and
let
ms
worry
about
whether
it
should
be
called
microsoft
windows
or
the
microsoft
window
system
or
how
about
just
plain
microsoft
to
summarise
or
should
that
be
summarize
the
point
of
this
message
i
think
there
are
far
more
pressing
issues
facing
the
x
community
than
worrying
about
subtle
distinctions
in
the
naming
of
the
window
system
or
should
that
be
windowing
system
whatever
gets
recognised
is
fine
by
me
i
agree
that
one
should
be
careful
in
interpreting
what
trade
papers
say
however
i
would
be
reluctant
to
come
to
this
conclusion
purely
on
the
basis

probably
not
the

is
true
of

the

x

monickers
are
proper

in
the
same
sense
that
any

a
proper

in

some
of

are

the
fact
that
many

largely
beside
the

as
for
the
trade

that
promulgate
things

any

nonsensical

i
ronald
van

at
a
certain
point
last

have
taken

fixing

new
release
i
am

pleased

imake
support
nb
this
release
relies
heavily
on
the
existence
of
imake
and
its
config
files
on
your
site
i
have
tried
to
provide
the
bindings
with
a
standard
makefile
tweakable
for
those
unfortunates
without
imake
i
have
not
severely
tested
the
standard
makefile
though
contact
me
if
you
have
problems
the
reason
for
calling
this
a
gamma
release
lies
in
the
fact
that
i
do
not
have
a
multitude
of
platforms
to
test
the
imakefiles
on
lots
of
testfiles
even
somewhat
useful

dear

its
a
pleasure
to

xavier
an

xavierextension
av

for

is
a
c
class
library
that
adds
multimedia
capability
to
interviews
it
allows
composite
multimedia
objects
to
be
built
from
media
objects
specifically
it
adds
audio
and
video
objects
to
the
classes
available
in
interviews
and
it
does
so
without
changing
the
source
code
for
the
original
classes
though
several
configuration
files
for
interviews
need
to
be
changed
via
a
patch
file
currently
the
xavier
audio
classes
are
only
supported
on

standard

im

with
the
default
colormap
when
i
use
standard

created

the

goes
black
so
it
seems
as
if
use

standard

causes
the
very
problem
standard
colormaps
are
intended
to
avoid
perhaps
if
every
application
used
standard
colormaps
things
would
be
wonderful
but
not
many
applications
seem
to
use
standard
colormaps
finally
the
operation
of
the
functions
xmugetcolormapallocation
xmustandardcolormap

xmucreatecolormap
seem
inconsistent
with
the
section

the
xlib
documentation

section

documentation

values
for
the
call
to

avoid
perhaps
if
every
application
used
standard
colormaps
things
would
be
wonderful
but
not
many
applications
seem
to
use
standard
colormaps
does
your
hardware
have
only
one
clut
since
standard
colormaps
typically
devour
all
entries
there
is
no
way
it
can
avoid
displacing
the
entire
default
colormap
if
your
hardware
has
only
one
clut
i
dont
believe
standard
colormaps
are
intended
to
aboid
possible
colormap
flashing
between
clients
using
the
default
coilormap
rather
colormap
flashing
will
be
avoided
between
two
clients
that
use
the
same
standard
colormap
an
example
would
be
two
clients
that
need
a
full
color
range
would
both
use
xargbbestmap
or
whatever
its
called
under
if
you
are
trying
to
avoid
colormap
flashing
with
the
default
colormap
your
best
bet
is
to
try
to
load
all
the
colors
you
use
into
that
colormap
if
you
cant
do
that
then
youll
get
flashing
on
a
one
hw
clut
framebuffer
now
if
your
window
manager
used
the
same
standard
colormap
as
your
client
this
flashing
could
also
be
avoided
perhaps
some
window
managers
have
command
line
options
for
selecting
standard
colormaps

x

scanline
padding
question
i
am
almost
done
porting
to
a
new
piece
of
display
hardware
but
have
run
into
a
snag
i
think
may
be
somewhat
commonplace
so
im
sending
a
netfeeler
i
have
a
display
that
is
a
noninterlaced
memory
mapped
display
the
servers
view
of
the
world
obtained
via
xwd
xwud
seems
to
be
exactly
what
it
should
be
however
the
displayed
version
of
the
framebuffer
gives
the
impression
that
the
server
is
using
scanlines
that
are
too
long
after
a
bit
of
experimentation
it
seems
that
the
problem
was
that
the
server
was
padding
the
line
out
to
a
word
boundry
but
the
scanline
size
in
the
buffer
is
bytes
which
isnt
exactly
divisible
by
four
changing
the
following
defines
in
mitserverincludeservermdh
define
bitmapscanlinepad
define
define
to
define
bitmapscanlinepad
define
define
was
not
exactly
the
right
solution
how
do
i
tell
the
server
either
a
dont
pad
the
scan
lines
at
all
cause
this
server
is
only
being
built
to
run
on
this
particular
display
or
to
pad
only
to

keyboard
mapping
and
window
placement
questions
these
are
two
common
subjects
so
i
hope
someone
has
had
to
deal
with
these
specific
questions
if
my
application
depends
on
modifiers
what
is
the
best
lookup
method
my
choices
are
to
call
xgetmodifiermapping
for
each
key
press
with
a
modifier
or
make
the
call
once
at
the
init
of
the
app
and
store
the
modifiers
in
a
lookup
table
i
would
like
to
do
it
the
second
way
but
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
notify
when
the
user
uses
xmodmap
to
remap
the
modifiers
i
know
that
when
an
app
calls
xsetmodifiermapping
a
mappingnotify
event
is
generated
nonmaskable
which
i
can
pick
up
and
modify
my
internal
table
but
i
dont
seem
to
get
any
notify
events
when
the
user
uses
xmodmap
if
i
use
xt
all
oreilly
has
to
say
is
is
automatically
handled
by
xt
if
i
use
xlib
ala
xnextevent
i
get
nothing
this
all
stems
from
problems
with
users
of
the
sun
keyboard
and
the
numlock
plus
various
altmetaetc
modifier
requirements
i
would
like
to
place
a
popup
so
that
it
will
be
to
the
immediate
right
of
my
main
window
i
want
it
at
the
same

coord
and
their

sides
touching
what
i
need
to
ask
for
is
the
xy
coord
of
the
window
managers
border
for
the
main
window
this
should
ring
a
bell
with
anyone
who
has
called
xtmovewidget
immediately
checking
the
xy
after
the
move
and
seeing
that
it
is
right
and
in
their

asking
for
the
xy

its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
powerful
server
machine
because
of
the
significant
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
is
costly
and
the
bandwidth
limited
thats
why
my
interest
lies
in
seeing
if
such
a
link
can
be
used
and
see
what
traffic
goes
through
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
has
anyone
at
your
centre
monitored
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
running
any
standard
mswindows
programs
like
word
what
sort
of
packets
go
blazing
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
or
what
is
the
average
traffic
flow
going
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peaks
and
then
many
low
points
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
apps
are
all
doing
network
things
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
things
i
vision
using
ms
windows

other

were
the

are
running

all

connecting

digitiser
to
x
repost
hi
there
i
posted
this
to
compwindowsxintrinsics
but
got
no
response
so
im
posting
here
im
wanting
to
connect
a
digitiser
made
for
pcs
into
my
workstation
an
hp
it
is
my
understanding
the
x
windows
can
understand
a
variety
of
input
devices
including
digitiser
tablets
however
this
digitiser
makes
use
of
the
serial
port
so
there
would
seem
to
be
a
need
to
have
a
special
device
driver
the
hp
manual
pages
say
that
the
hp
x
server
will
accept
x
input
from
devices
listed
in
the
file
display
number
i
shouldnt
think
i
would
be
able
to
simply
insert
as
an
input
device
in
this
file
and
expect
a
digitiser
to
work
but
maybe
im
wrong
am
i
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
does
anybody
out
there
have
a
digitiser
connected
to
their
workstation
for
use
as
a
pointer
for
x
rather
than
just
as
input
to
a
specific
x
application
if
so
what
were
the
steps
required
for
installation
did
you
need
a
special
device
driver
did
the
manufacturer
supply
it
are
there
generic
public
domain
device
drivers
around
i
understand
that
digitisers
generally
use
only
a
couple
of
standard
formats
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated

ive
found
a
problem
in
the
use

regarding

i
decided
to
implement
an
animated
cursor
using
created
cursors
by
calling
xdefinecursor
from
a

signal
handler
this
is
used
to
indicate
we
are
waiting
for
a

request
to
complete
on
a

control
system
i
was
redrawing
the
screen
underneath
the
animated
cursor
and
then
restoring
the
standard
cursor
when
complete
i
found
dumped
core
and
upon
analysis
it
was
when
the
sigalrm
handler
was
called
during
a
xdrawstring
call
xdrawstring
was
doing
a
bcopy
presumably
an
internal
structure
when
the
xdefinecursor
was
called
presumably
the
internal
structure
that
xdrawstring
was
manipulating
was
not
in
a
stable
state
and
sent
xdefinecursor
to
where
it
shouldnt
have
been
has
anyone
else
experienced
this
is
there
any
official
documentation
that
says
you
should
ensure
this
doesnt
happen
or
should
bcopy
be
atomic

german
keyboard
altgr
hi
ppl
i
am
running

and
am
trying
to
get
the
german
keyboard
working
i
have
already
recompiled
my
kernel
and
the
german
keyboard
in
the
textmode
works
just
fine
i
have
found
out
that
there
is
a
preconfigured
german
keymap
for
x
called
xmodmapgr
in
so
i
ran
xmodmap
my
first
impression
was
very
good
i
was
able
to
get
z
and
y
straight
theres
still
a
little
problem
i
cant
solve
however
i
cannot
get
at
the
backslash
bar
brackets
and
curly
brackets
the
altgr
key
doesnt
seem
to
work
i
tried
xev
to
find
out
whether
it
produces
an
event
at
all
and
it
does
looking
up
its
keycode
in
the
xmodmap
i
found
the
entry
modeswitch
which
doesnt
ring
any
bell
the
entries
for
the
keys
i
cannot
use
seem
to
be
correct
example
keycode
xx
ssharp
questn
backslash
the
first
entries
i
can
even
get
at
the
first
one
is
the
unmodified
key
and
the
second
is
the
key
with
shift
but
what
is
the
my
guess
is
that
it
should
be
the
key
with
altgr
but
it
isnt
if
anybody
has
run
into
similar
problems
and
knows
how
to

what

this
two

mean

where
should

what
are
the
responsibilities

how

can
i
fork
more

so
that

need
help
with
mitmagiccookie
im
trying
to
turn
on
xauthorization
using

on

xterminals
but
im
running
into
a
couple
of
problems
first
at
least
one
of
our
applications
maple
doesnt
seem
to
understand
how
to
deliver
the
magic
cookie
and
wont
run
on
a
display
with
authorization
turned
on
second
we
have
people
with
client
software
on
remote
machines
and
i
really
dont
want
to
hassle
them
with
having
to
copy
their
xauthority
file
to
the
remote
machine
assuming
that
the
clients
there
support
xauthorization
so
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
turn
on
mitmagiccookie
by
default
with
nonprivileged
users
able
to
turn
it
off
dropping
back
to
hostbased
authorization
yes
i
know
how
to
turn
it
off
by
changing
the
xconfig
file
for
the
heads
and
the
client
authorize
setting
for
the
xterminals
but
nonprivileged
users
cant
do
this
ive
checked
with
the
hp
support
line
and
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
way
can
anyone
confirm
this
or
do
you
know
of
a
way
to
accomplish
what
i
want
btw
im

in

im

that
may

this
seems

be

in

i
use

that
generally
works

not

move

it
must

it
must
run

etc
it
must
compile
under

with

most
generic
unix

works
ok
it
must
produce
postscript
files
that
i
can
include
into

with
dvips
or
just
tell
me
another
free
program
that
converts
one

tgif
i
have
no
experience
with
any
of

features
i
would
like
in
the
programs
are
ability
to
draw
circles
arcs
straight
lines
boxes
and
arrows
support
for
both
dashed

solid
line
styles
for
all

in
any
size
ability
to
movecopyresizerotate
any

ability
to
turn
any
part
of
the
drawing
into
a
library
component
eg
a

composed
of
three
lines
an
arrow
and
a
circle
any
aid
numeric
coordinates
screen
grid
to
align
parts
of
the

less
essential
but
in

very
handy
preservation

connection
if
i
move
one
part
of
the
drawing
the
lines
that
connect
that
part
to
the
rest
of
the

stay
connected
ideally
i
want
the

so
general

the
andrew
consortium
of
the
school
of
computer
science
at
carnegie
mellon
is
pleased
to
announce
auis
for
the
andrew
user
interface
system
version
our
cdrom
version
was
developed
for
aix
version
on
the
ibm
and
many
other
platforms
to
accomodate
aix
version
we
have
created
a
patch
to
the
sources
the
patch
and
accompanying
instructions
for
its
application
can
be
retrieved
at
no
charge
via
anonymousftp
from
the
internet
host
emsworthandrewcmuedu
in

below
the

system
can
be
ordered
from
us
as
a
cdrom
or
ftped
from
the
same
host
note
that
this
patch
adds
no
additional
functionality
but
simply
allows
auis
to
compile
under
the
andrew
user
interface
system
auis
is
a
comprehensive
environment
on
top
of
windows
in
which
you
can
create
use
and
mail
multimedia
applications
and
documents
a
major
advantage
of
auis
is
the
capability
to
recursively
embed
objects
thus
one
can
edit
text
that
not
only
contains
multiple
fonts
indentation
and
other
typography
but
also
contains
embedded
raster
images
spreadsheets
drawing
editors
equations
simple
animations
and
so
on
these
embedded
objects
can
themselves
contain
other
objects
including
text
auis
has
three
components
the
andrew
user
environment
is
an
integrated
and
extensible
set
of
applications
beginning
with
the
ez
text
editor
a
help
system
a
system
monitoring
tool
an
editorbased
shell
interface
and
other
editors
corresponding
to
the
various
available
types
of
objects
the
andrew
toolkit
atk
is
a
portable
objectoriented
userinterface
toolkit
that
provides
the
architecture
wherein
objects
can
be
embedded
in
oneanother
with
the
toolkit
programmers
can
create
new
objects
that
can
be
embedded
as
easily
as
those
that
come
with
the
system
the
andrew
message
system
ams
provides
a
multimedia
interface
to
mail
and
bulletinboards
ams
supports
several
mail
management
strategies
and
implements

including
authentication
return

configure
event
handling
repost
i
have
two
questions
well
probably
more
about
how
expose
configure
events
are
handled
i
have
an
appl
which
uses
window
to
draw
in
since
i
give
the
user
the
capability
of
scaling
and
zooming
as
well
as
allowing
the
window
to
be
resized
i
made
a
translation
table
for
the
expose
configure
events
the
expose
event
calls
my
redraw
method
while
the
configure
event
calls
my
rescale
method
the
rescale
method
invokes
a
fake
expose
event
actually
just
calls
the
redraw
w
an
appropriate
expose
struct
to
draw
the
data
quest
when
the
appl
is
compiledlinked
w
running
in
either
or
env
i
get
multiple
redraws
when
the
window
gets
uncovered
or
the
size
is

i
assume
im
getting

events
is
that
right
any
suggestions

getting

all
i
need
a
list

the
bugs
for

thanks
neal
subject
xmtextfield
truncation
with
lang
bug
i
have
found
a
situation
which
i
think
is
a
bug
in
x
or
motif
but
im
hoping
is
really
just
a
mistake
on
my
part
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
problem
i
am
using
an
xmtextfield
and
setting
its
xmnvalue
to
a
hardcoded
text
string
ascii
or
kanji
either
via
xtsetvalues
or
xmtextsetstring
the
problem
is
that
when
the
xmtextfield
is
displayed
the
text
is
getting
truncated
depending
on
the
setting
of
the
environment
variables
lang
more
specifically
lcall
when
they
are
set
to
japanese
the
text
gets
truncated
when
they
are
set
to
english
everything
works
fine
i
am
taking
the
default
for
xmncolumns
please
note
that
hardcoding
of
text
is
not
done
in
my
actual
application
just
in
my
sample
code
to
make
things
easier
i
am
running
motif
via
my
test
program
is
set
up
to
handle
bit
kanji
characters
i
have
remembered
to
do
xtsetlanguageproc
prior
to
my
mrminitialize
and
my
font
resources
are
set
to
japanese
fonts
dont
know
if
this
matters
but
my
dialog
box
and
textfield
is
initially
created
with
uil
the
problem
does
not
happen
with
xmtext
unfortunately
substituting
xmtextfields
with
xmtexts
in
my
application
is
not
an
acceptable
alternative
way
too
much
code
to
be
modified
while
in
beta
i
have
a
small
test
program
which
illustrates
the
problem
if
anyone
wants
it
my
best
guess
is
that
either
the
x
code
or
motif
is
not
properly
allocating
memory
for
japanese
but
since
i
dont
have
the
source
to
look
at
it
is
just
a
guess
please
let
me
know
if
this
sounds
familiar
or
if
you
have
a
suggestion
or
if
you
want
the
sample

the

for
the

to
respond
to
its
positioning
request
the
windowmanager
is
not
responding
because
it
thinks
the
window
is
already
in
the
right
place
exactly
why
the
two
components
get
into
this
sulk
is
unclear
to
me
all
information
greatly
received
this
problem
is
caused
by
a
bad
interaction
between
the
way
olwm
reparents
windows
a
misfeature
of
the
x
protocol
and
a
bug
in
the
xt
intrinsics
the
intrinsics
bug
is
that
it
ignores
the
xy
position
given
in
reparentnotify
events
olwm
is
structured
in
such
a
way
that
when
a
window
is
popped
down
the
last
event
the
client
receives
is
a
reparentnotify
event
at
this
point
the
intrinsics
notion
of
the
shells
location
is
out
of
date
if
a
setvalues
is
done
using
the
same
xy
position
the
intrinsics
thinks
it
needs
to
move
the
shell
so
it
issues
a
configurewindow
request
to
move
it
there
however
a
misfeature
of
the
x
protocol
is
that
a
configurewindow
request
that
has
no
effect
will
generate
no
configurenotify
event
the
intrinsics
thus
waits
for
an
event
that
will
never
arrive
and
times
out
after
wmtimeout
has
expired
actually
things
are
somewhat
more
complex
because
the
request
is
redirected
to
the
window
manager
but
the
net
result
is
the
same
the
solution
is
for
the
intrinsics
to
note
the
xy
positioning
information
in
reparentnotify
events
this
has
been
implemented
and
is
available

preventing
user

hitting
ctrlaltbksp
to
exit
x
hello
i
am
admin
for
an
running
aix
motif
and
i
want
to
prevent
the
user
from
hitting
cntlaltbkspc
to
exit
x
ive
tried
invoking
x
with
xinit
t
but
that
doesnt
work
xinit
appends
the
t
to
the
call
to
xinitrc
and
not
to
the
call
to
x
the
man
page
to
xinit
is
no
help
in
fact
it
tells
me
that
xinit
is
a
script
when
it
is
really
a
binary
file
so
far
the
only
way
ive
been
able
to
accomplish
this
feat
is
to
add
the
t
to
the
call
to
x
in
i
would
rather
not
do
it
this
way
does
anyone
have
any
other
ideas

the
subject
re
xv
has
escaped
it
is
interesting
to
look
at
the
changes
of
mind
that
john
has
had
very
interested
indeed
this
is
against
this
kind
of
changes
that
the
gnu
copyleft
is
protecting
us
anyway
at
simulog
we
will
abandon
xv
we
were
using
it
mostly
for
slide
shows
because
of
its
loop
feature
that
display
does
not
have
display
from
the
wonderful
imagemagick
package
d
but
i
think
i
will
implement
it
myself
even
a
shellscript
should
do
the
job
and
forget
xv

subject
colormap
problem
i
am
saving
an
image
on
one
machine
and
redisplaying
the
image
on
another
machine
both
are
hp
model
the
image
is
created
using
xcreateimage
and
xgetimage
and
displayed
with
xputimage
the
image
is
redisplayed
correctly
except
that
the
colors
are
wrong
because
the
server
on
the
other
machine
is
using
a
different
colormap
i
tried
saving
the
colormap
pixel
and
rgb
values
and
on
the
redisplay
performed
a
table
lookup
against
the
new
colormap
this
didnt
work
because
some
rgb
combos
dont
exist
in
the
new
colormap
is
there
a
way
to
force
the
server
to
load
colors
into
set
pixel
values
or
is
there
a
simpler
way
to
solve
this
problem
i
tried
using
xinitcolormap
but
couldnt
get
that
to
work
either
any
help
would
be
appreciated

had

i
thought
i
would
post
my
contribution
this
perl
script
is
my
solution
it
trys
to
be
intelligent
about
what
its
doing
so
that
you
should
be
able

type
rx
hostdomainetc
and
get
a
xterm
running
on
hostdomainetc
with
all
the
difficult
stuff
taken
care
of
in
theory
this
program
can
do
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
do
when
you
wanted
to
run
a
remote
command
in
the
background
it
doesnt
even
need

why

i
using

it

hang
waiting

either
via

is

the
text
is
getting
truncated
depending
on
the
setting
of
the

variables
lang
more
specifically
lcall
when

the

everything
works
fine
i

dont
know
if
this
matters
but
my

the
problem
does
not
happen
with

unfortunately
substituting

is
not
an
acceptable
alternative
way

since

that

my
question
is
this
is
there
a

of
determining
what
the

numlock

i
dont
know
any
way
except
to
see
what

are
on
in

if
there
is
some
reason
why
you
need
to
always

even
if
your

dont
have
the

you
can
always
ask
for
keypress
events
from
the
root
window
then
you
get
all
the
keypresses
and
you
always
know
what
have
been
pressed
an
even
more
pointed
question
is
there
an
easy
means
of
making
an
x
keyboard
act
like
a
pc
keyboard
ie
capslock
is
active
and
the
user
presses
shifta
id
like
to
get
a
lowercase
a
instead
of
a
i
think
this
is
just
a
question
of
how
to
implement
xlookupstring
you
can
always
write
another
function
that
interprets
the
keypresses
as
you
like
you
can
look
at
the
implementation
of
xlookupstring
from
the
xlib
sources
and
then
modify

i

they
all
seem
basically
the
same
each

will
beg
to

i
realize
that
there
are

but
i
dont
have
an
infinate
amount

to
discover
what
they
are
the
tools
i
have
looked

so
far
are
uimx
xdesigner
teleuse
tcltkinterviews
and
suit
so
far
ive
drawn
the
following
conclusions
the
builder
for
interviews
is
not
very
mature
bad
docs
teleuse
is
very
expensive
and
uses
a
proprietary
toolkit
uimx
xdesigner
seem
about
the

even
though
xdesigner
does
not
have
a

ill
by

if

i

re
table
widget
causing
trouble
with
xtquerygeometry
i
just
got
a
bug
report
and
a
fix
for
this
exact
problem
from
fisheriscpbellcorecom
greg
fisher
the
most
serious
problem
i
have
identified
has
not
been
incorporated
this
problem
occurs
when
the
table
widgets
geometrymanager
is
invoked
by
a
child
this
will
work
correctly
if
the
table
widgets
parent
complies
with
the
xt
protocols
however
if
they
do
not
as
is
the
case
for
some
motif
widgets
and
they
ignore
xtcwqueryonly
then
the
sizing
will
be
incorrect
in
order
to
see
this
problem
the
following
events
must
happen
a
child
of
the
table
widget
must
request
a
new
size
the
table
widget
must
query
its
parent
for
a
new
size
having
set
xtcwqueryonly
the
parent
must
ignore
the
xtcwqueryonly
bit
and
resize
the
table
widget
as
part
of
the
resize
xmptableforgetproposedlayout
is
called
this
will
set
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
to
zero
the
table
will
continue
setting
up
the
new
size
working
under
the
assumption
that
it
is
working
with
a
proposed
and
not
actual
layout
at
the
end
it
will
call
xmptablesaveproposedlayout
this
will
save
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
and
restore
their
values
from
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
however
these
have
already
been
set
to
zero
since
the
table
widget
has
already
been
resized
it
will
not
need
a
second
resize
next
another
widget
managed
by
some
ancestor
of
the
table
is
resized
this
results
in
the
parent
of
the
table
requesting
the
tables
preferred
size
since
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
are
zero
this
will
return
as
the
preferred
size
the
parent
is
very
likely
to
grant
this
request
resulting
in
a
loss
of
the
whole
table
from
the
display
he
isolated
the
problem
a
proposed
a
workaround
which
seems
precisely
correct

hello

we

the

if
we
could
assign
the

to
a
class
of

rather
than

also
accomplish

each

its
not

so
you
have
people
on

if
you
had
a
badly
loaded

the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some

but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the

itself
say
you
have
a

plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time

but
if
you
have

youll
know
it

because
of
the
significant
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
is
costly
and
the
bandwidth
limited
thats
why
my
interest
lies
in
seeing
if
such
a
link
can
be
used
and
see
what
traffic
goes
through
it
since
i
dont
think
tom
always
gets
time
to
read
this
group
ill
take
the
liberty
of
responding
to
some
of
this
if
you
really
want
tom
to
reply
you
should
send
mail
to
supportqdeckcom
a
line
is
certainly
going
to
restrict
you
far
more
than
the
ethernet
that
we
typically
run
how
restrictive
it
will
be
depends
on
what
you
run
and
how
you
run
it
i
would
think
that
a
couple
of
instances
of
some
really
nasty
program
like
smoking
clover
would
make
the
link
useless
for
anyone
else
on
the
other
hand
probably
xclocks
quietly
updating
every
seconds
or
so
wouldnt
impact
it
too
much
in
the
real
world
you
will
be
somewhere
in
between
these
two
extremes
going
by
the
way
i
personally
use
x
on
a
daily
basis
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
to
share
that
link
with
more
than
other
people
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
has
anyone
at
your
centre
monitored
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
running
any
standard
mswindows
programs
like
word
what
sort
of
packets
go
blazing
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
or
what
is
the
average
traffic
flow
going
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peaks
and
then
many
low
points
our
corporate
wan
is
as
unique
as
any
other
the
usage
patterns
are
not
very
good
predictors
of
how
yours
will
behave
the
only
one
of
our
low
bandwidth
links
that
normally
get
used
in
this
way
is
a
link
to
ireland
that
they
often
use
to
run
a
dos
text
based
client
end
of
a
clientserver
database
remotely
from
the
dvx
machine
behind
me
since
the
server
end
is
or
was
always
at
this
end
california
it
is
faster
to
remotely
run
the
client
via
desqview
x
and
have
a
short
hop
to
the
server
than
running
the
client
locally
and
having
a
long
hop
to
the
server
as
i
warned
you
this
tells
us
very
little
about
how
you
usage
pattern
will
fill
a
isdn
link
running
word
for
windows
remotely
is
going
to
itself
be
very
usage
dependent
lets
break
it
into
pieces
and
look
at
it
tracking
the
mouse
pointer
is
easy
and
efficient
to
translate
from
windows
calls
into
x
popping
up
a
menu
is
a
little
more
involved
and
will
generate
some
traffic
restoring
the
screen
that
was
covered
by
that
menu
may
be
easy
and
may
not
be
does
the
server
that
its
displaying
on
have
backing
store
if
so
and
the
server
had
enough
memory
the
display
can
be
updated
locally
and
will
generate
little
network
traffic
if
no
backing
store
then
what
was
being
covered
up
if
it
was
a
solid
colored
rectangle
of
space
we
can
tell
your
xserver
to
draw
that
quite
easily
if
it
was
a
full
color
backdrop
of
ren
stimpy
we
may
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
x
server
bit
by
bit
dvx
will
do
its
level
best
to
only
redraw
that
small
area
but
in
some
unusual
cases
the
entire
screen
may
need
to
be
repainted
assuning
a
screen
with
bits
per
pixel
thats
bits
that
has
to
be
sent
worst
possible
case
youre
looking
at
about
seconds
in
reality
it
would
never
be
this
bad
since
the
screen
will
always
have
parts
that
will
be
tranlatable
into
higher
level
x
calls
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
apps
are
all
doing
network
things
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
things
i
vision
using
ms
windows
and
other
windows
applications
over
the
network
were
the
processes
are
running
on
the
server
and
all
i
am
getting
are
the
displays
i
am
wondering
how
good
is
the
x
and
subsequently
dvx
protocol
in
transferring
these
images
with
xcalls
and
displaying
them
on
a
clients
machine
x
was
designed
from
the
ground
up
to
be
efficient
across
a
network
its
pretty
good
for
this
x
programs
are
best
dos
text
programs
are
almost
as
good
since
we
conert
them
to
x
easily
something
like
winx
is
a
hybrid
we
intercept
the
calls
windows
makes
to
its
graphics
driver
mouse
driver
keyboard
driver
and
convert
them
to
x
the
calls
windows
is
making
are
in
no
way
designed
to
be
efficient
on
a
packet
switched
network
we
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
convert
them
to
the
highes
level
xlib
calls
we
can
but
we
are
somewhat
limited
because
we
only
know
what
windows
and
its
applications
tell
us

very

move
one

that
connect

to
the
rest

stay

you

tgif
handles
everything
except
rotation
and
any

text
it
only
supports
degrees
rotation
currently
it
supports
standard
font
sizes
however
it
allows
arbitrary
scaling
of

effectively
it
allows
any
font

but
you
can
only
have
different
sizes

xdm
xkernel
and
olwm
greetings
we
have
a
network
of

workstations
running
sunos
and
openwindows
of
these
are
sun
that
we
have
modified
to
run
seth
robertsons
xkernel
image
effectively
turning
them
into
xterminals
we
use
xdm
to
manage
the
displays
when
we
had
xkernel
machines
things
worked
fine
but
when
we
installed
more
last
weekend
we
appear
to
have
found
a
weakness
with
clients
to
sparc
the
sparc
window
manager
is
eventually
getting
munged
let
me
try
to
be
precise
the
user
sitting
at
the
machine
that
does
all
the
actual
processing
for
these
xterminals
is
having
control
of
his
keyboard
and
screen
yanked
away
when
this
was
the
department
chair
it
was
kind
of
cute
we
poked
at
xdm
for
a
few
days
and
are
satisfied
that
it
is
not
at
fault
our
current
theory
is
that
olwm
the
sun
version
was
not
meant
for
running
multiple
copies
on
one
machine
which
is
what
happens
the
console
user
runs
olwm
and
every
xterminal
logged
in
has
olwm
running
on
the
xterminal
server
has
anyone
had
any
prior
experience
with
this
sort
of
behavior
can
anyone
shoot
obvious
holes
in
this
theory
how
about
obvious
gimmes
and
of
course
any
ideas
on
how
to
solve
it
any

are

xdm
on
with
and
on
and
sparcs
running
sunos
prior
to
using
xdm
i
used
to
set
path
and
other
environment
variables
like
manpath
helppath
arch
etc
in
my
login
file
with
xdm
the
login
file
doesnt
get
executed
and
therefore
neither
the
olwm
rootwindow
nor
my
applications
know
about
these
variables
one
usual
suggestion
is
to
put
everything
into
your
everytime
shell
rcfile
instead
of
your
loginonly
one
which
is
fair
enough
if
you
only
have
a
few
users
who
know
what
theyre
doing
if
you
have
several
hundred
users
who
do
what
the
books
tell
them
though
then
its
confusing
at
best
another
is
to
have
your
xterms
run
login
shells
but
that
still
leaves
the
window
manager
and
the
things
that
get
started
from
its
menus
with
the
wrong
environment
our
alternative
is
that
instead
of
having
xdm
run
the
client
startup
scripts
it
runs
the
users
favourite
shell
as
a
login
shell
and
has
it
then
run
the
rest
of
the
startup
scripts
that
way
the
users
usual
environment
gets
set
up
as
normal
and
inherited
by
everything

looking

greetings
i
am
developing
an
application
that
allows
a
user
to
interactively
createeditview
a
visual
model
ie
topology
of
their
network
and
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
knew
of
any
builder
tools
that
exist
to
simplify
this
task
in
the
past
i
have
used
visual
edges
uimx
product
to
develop
other
guis
so
i
am
familiar
with
uimss
in
general
the
topology
will
support
objects
and
connecting
links
once
the
topology
is
created
i
want
to
provide
the
user
with
capabilities
to
support
grouping
zooming
etc
i
am
looking
for
some
form
of
a
higher
abstraction
other
than
x
drawing
routines
to
accomplish
this
specifically
the
zooming
and
grouping
aspects
may
prove
difficult
and
certainly
time
consuming

i
have

like
drawpointxycolor

or
with

i
have
to

anyway
what
you
say
is
not
really
true
the
color
information
is
associated
with
a
graphicscontext
not
with
a
display
and
the
gc
is
a
parameter
to
the
drawing
routines
so
if
you
need
to
fast
switch
between
green
dotted
lines
and
blue
ones
of
width
you
can
make
gcs
for
those
cases
and
then
simply
do
for
this
effect
this
is
eventually
more
complicated
to
do
for
the
programmer
but
also
much
more
efficient
and
flexible
you
would
not
include
all
the
other
parameters
like
line
pattern
with
cap
and
joinstyle
drawmode
and
so
on

call

why
do
it

color

i
am
familiar

the
topology
will
support

connecting

once
the
topology
is
created
i
want
to
provide
the

with
capabilities
to
support
grouping
zooming
etc
i
am
looking
for
some
form
of
a
higher
abstraction
other
than
x
drawing
routines
to
accomplish
this
specifically
the
zooming
and
grouping
aspects
may
prove
difficult

certainly
time

i
have

roll
my

i
have
done
this
before
but
im
not
sure
i
used
the
best
approach
although
i
tried
several
methods
you
have
to
run
up
the
window
heirarchy
using
xquerytree
until
you
get
to
the
root
window
now
this
is
not
so
simple
because
some
window
managers
slap
a
window
over
the
root
window
that
is
the
same
size
as
the
root
window
so
be
sure
to
take
that
into
account
for
further
calculations
calculate
the
position
and
widthheight
offsets
for
each
window
using
xgetgeometry
be
sure
to
take
the
borderwidth
into
consideration
remember
a
windows
borderwidth
is
on
the
outside
of
a
window
so
the
windows
xywidthheight
must
be
adjusted
accordingly
all
of
this
should
give
you
pretty
good
numbers
for
how
much
space
the
windowmanager
is
using
now
to
place
the
new
window
you
have
to
use
the
same
numbers
to
calculate
where
you
want
to
place
it
because
the
windowmanager
will
reparent
it
on
the
outside
of
where
you
place
your
window
if
i
remember
correctly
disclaimer
all
of
this
is
from
memory
and
i
no
longer
have
the
code
but
i
did
get
it
working
under
several
window
managers
correctly
feel
free
to
call
or

further

x
server
only
on

i
have
been
using
a

and
really
like
it
what
is
really
powerful
is
that
it
can
run
the
x
server
without
running
a
window
manager
one
can
then
run
a

x
program
called
a

manager
either
run
motif

openlook
from
its
own

limiting
the
network
traffic
but
having
no
home
or
run
motif
or
openlook
from
some
home
place
like
a
sparc
or
vms
this
is
powerful
especially
since
i
can
exit
one
window
manager
without
killing
windows
and
then
start
up
another
manager
some
of
my
vms
tools
need
special
metamouse
combos
that
work
in
one
manager
and
not
the
other
well
the
question
is
on

running

does
anyone
know
how
to
break
apart
olwm
from
the

basically
i
want
to
run
only
the

and
go
somewhere
else
to
run
the

please
respond

use

all

every

maintaining

answering

and
i
can
honestly
say
that
in
the
last
few
months
ive
never
had
my
machine
go
down
due
to
any
sort
of
tcpip
network
manager
instability
of
course
ive
crashed
my
machine
quite
a
few
times
on
purpose
during
beta
testing
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
tcpip
portion
is
quite
stable
however
keep
in
mind
that
dvx
and
the
network
managers
are
only
going
to
be
as
stable
as
the
software
they
sit
on
top
of
so
if
your
underlying
network
kernel
is
flakey
you
cant
expect
dvx
to
be
terribly
stable
how
does
it
send
the
information
from
a
ms
windows
app
over
the
protocol
does
it
just
draw
everything
as
graphics
into
one
window
or
does
it
use
multiple
windows
and
essentially
work
more
cleverly
it
just
goes
as
a
window
that
has
graphics
drawn
into
it
to
vastly
oversimplify
what
goes
on
we
just
take
the
windows
graphics
api
calls
and
translate
them
directly
to
xprotocol
unfortunately
windows
was
not
really
written
to
be
networkaware
so
sometimes
we
see
a
speed
penalty
when
an
app
does
something
stupid
like
sending
a
big
white
bitmap
to
erase
something
rather
than
just
drawing
a
white
box
fortunately
that
sort
of
thing
is
rare
if
i
want
to
run
ms
word
for
example
remotely
do
i
have
to
run
a

of
ms
windows
remotely
and
then
start
ms
word
from
that
or
can
ms
word
be
started
remotely
on
its
own
you
need
to
run
ms
windows
which
word
then
runs
inside
you
could
run
multiple
windows
programs
within
the
one
winx
window
and
windows
has
ways
to
automagically
start
winapps
when
you
start
windows
so
in
practice
its
not
really
a
major
problem
i
have
my
system
set
up
so
that
i
can
run
winx
which
automatically
starts

fullscreen
for

i

hi
hpsjachhawaiiedu
subject
resolution
bitmapped
fonts
device
independence
i
recently
corrected
the
resolution
on
my
sparcstation
by
changing
from
local
dpi
to
local
dpi
i
determined
that
my
monitor
was
dpi
by
measuring
the
active
screen
area
and
dividing
by
resolution
however
this
has
caused
my
application
fonts
to
behave
strangely
after
some
research
i
believe
this
is
caused
by
my
applications
requesting
fonts
by
family
weight
slant
and
pointsize
i
believe
that
x
is
grabbing
the
first
font
on
the
path
with
these
characteristics
and
displaying
it
since
i
have
only
and
fonts
on
my
path
the
results
are
inaccurate
i
do
have
some
speedo
fonts
but
not
for
the
family
i
am
using
helvetica
i
think
this
is
incorrect
the
fonts
should
always
be
provided
in
the
resolution
of
the
display
this
never
seems
to
happen
unless
you
explicitly
request
fonts
by
xres
and
yres
this
is
true
of
both
the
scaleable
and
bitmapped
fonts
for
instance
the
command
xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
speedo
font
the
command
xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
or
a
font
depending
on
my
font
path
despite
the
fact
that
x
knows
my
display
is
dpi
and
that
it
can
generate
an
font
for
me
unless
i
my
applications
specifies
a
resolution
x
appears
to
pick
a
stupid
default
is
this
a
bug
is
it
a
feature
if
so
why
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
get
around
this
problem
people
have
suggested
that
i
lie
about
my
resolution
and
specify
a
single
font
path
or
not
both
this
would
at
least
make
my
app
consistent
but
i
like
being
able
to
look
at
rulers
that
appear
in
my
paint
application
and
say
yup
thats

with

becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from

in

i
put
together
a
quick

ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor

than
the

which
moves

data

this
was
on

ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
my
question
is
what
is
the
fastest
way
in
to
dump

to
a

can
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the

case
i

the
fastest
way
is
to
use
an
x
server
with
shared

extension
it
uses
shared
memory
if
it
is
a
local
x
server
hence
images
dont
have
to
be
duplicated
and
defaults
to
the
regular

is

open

what
is
openwindows
openwindows
is
a
windowing
environment
that
conforms
to
the
open
look
graphical
user
interface
specifications
its
compatible
with
the
window
system
from
mit
as
well
as
currently
suns
news
and
sunview
so
you
can
intermix
programs
written
for
any
of
those
systems
it
comes
from
sun
and
also
with
system
v
release
from
certain
vendors
openwindows
is
sometimes
also
called
openwin
or
xnews
after
the
program
used
to
start
it
and
the
main
executable
itself
respectively
it
should
not
be
called
windows
or
open
look
or
openlook
as
these
terms
are
either
wrong
or
apply
to
something
else
a
commerical
openwindows
source
licence
costs
about
for
the
server
plus
about
for
deskset
and
another
for
tooltalk

current

these
are

that
conform

specifications
see
the
bibliography
for
documentation
on
the
individual
toolkits
heres
a
brief
summary
olit
was
atts
open
look
intrinsics
toolkit
for
the
x
window
system
it
used
a
widget
set
and
was
probably
the
easiest
for
people
who
were
already
programmers
to
learn
you
could
buy
the
source
from
att
although
you
didnt
get
the
same
version
tht
sun
ship
sun
includes
the
olit
library
in
openwindows
qv
it
is
also
often
included
in
system
v
release
it
was
written
in
c
the
release
of
olit
in
openwindows
was
olit
olit
support
passed
to
usl
then
a
division
of
att
now
owned
by
novell
who
replaced
it
with
moolit
qv
note
that
because
of
the
nature
of
xt
subclassing
you
will
probably
want
or
need
olit
source
in
order
to
develop
a
large
application
or
anything
else
that
uses
subclasses
see
the
proceedings
of
the
x
technical
conference
xview
is
suns
toolkit
for
written
in
c
xview
is
similar
in
programmer
interface
to
sunview
theres
even
a
shell
script
to
help
migrate
source
code
from
sunview
to
xview
xview
is
often
said
to
be
the
easiest
toolkit
to
learn
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
x
windows
the
xview
toolkit
is
included
in
openwindows
and
full
source
is
available
by
anonymous
ftp
from
exportlcsmitedu
and
elsewhere
the
current
version
of
xview
from
sun
is
despite
rumours
to
the
contrary
some
even
from
within
sun
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
about
to
be
dropped
by
sun
xview
will
be
included
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
unlike
news
on
the
other
hand
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
likely
to
receive
as
much
attention
from
sun
in
the
future
as
olit
the
news
toolkit
tnt
was
an
objectoriented
programming
system
based
on
the
postscript
language
and
news
tnt
implements
many
of
the
open
look
interface
components
required
to
build
the
user
interface
of
an
application
its
currently
included
in
openwindows
the
current
version
of
tnt
from
sun
is
release
contains
some
incompatibilities
with
tnt
and
tnt
but
sun
are
committed
to
supporting
the
api
at
least
until
they
stop
news
support
some
time
later
this
year
and
replace
it
with
display
postscript
wail
you
might
ask
what
is
committed
to
means
in
this
context
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
it
means
absolutely
nothing
sun
currently
asserts
that
it
is
committed
to
olit
however
the
c
user
interface
toolkit
uit
consists
of
an
objectoriented
c
class
library
layered
on
top
of
xview
and
a
tool
to
generate
code
from
devguide
gil
files
the
uit
also
includes
features
that
simplify
event
management
and
the
use
of
postscript
and
color
it
is
said
to
be
compatible
with
openwindows
and
and
presumably
since
the
release
mentions
that
it
works
on
solaris
uit
is
not
an
official
sunsupported
product
but
an
ongoing
project
of
various
people
within
sun
it
can
be
found
on
exportlcsmitedu
in
the

contrib
directory

doesnt
motif
is
an
alternative
graphical
user
interface
that
is
being
developed
by
osf
it
has
a
look
and
feel
reminiscent
of
microsoft
windows
and
the
presentation
manager
there
are
no
non
commercial
motif
toolkits
available
although
the
motif
source
is
sold
reasonably
cheaply
by
osf
although
motif
is
currently
available
on
more
platforms
than
openwindows
the
open
look
gui
is
almost
certainly
used
on
many
more
machines
simply
because
sun

have
such
a
large
installed
base
suns

contains
a
roadmap
for

contact

what
about
that
display
postscript
thing
sun
and
adobe
have
agreed
that
sun
will
include
the
dps
extension
to
x
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
dps
is
essentially
a
badly
designed
hack
on
top
of
a
slow
level
postscript
interpreter
intended
to
give
a
very
small
subset
of
the
functionality
of
news
whilst
simultaneously
being
harder
to
use
as
i
understand
it
the
only
real
advantage
it
has
over
news
is
that
the
manual
is
much
smaller
being
generally
less
complete
dps
is
also
available
on
more
kinds
of
machine
performance
on
our
is
not
suitable
for
interactive
work
what
it
will
be
like
on
the
sparcstation
remains
to
be
seen
note
that
whereas
xnews
fonts
are
shared
by
both
subsystems
the
dps
extension
to
x
does
not
make
type
postscript
fonts
available
to
ordinary
programs
it
is
not
like
atm
on
a
pc
in
this
regard
there
is
at
least
one
thirdparty
version
which
does
make
fonts
available
however

window

what
are
olwm
and
olvwm
they
are
window
managers
a
window
manager
is
the
part
of
the
x
window
system
eg
that
is
responsible
for
deciding
how
to
lay
out
windows
on
the
screen
and
for
managing
the
users
interaction
with
the
windows
olwm
is
the
standard
open
look
window
manager
its
included
with
all
of
the
openwindows
qv
implementations
and
you
can
also
get
the
source
by
ftp
since
sun
donated
it
olvwm
is
a
version
of
olwm
that
manages
a
virtual
desktop
hence
the
v
in
its
name
it
shows
a
little
map
on
the
screen
with
the
currently
displayed
area
represented
by
a
little
rectangle
you
can
move
around
by
dragging
the
rectangle
or
with
the
arrow
keys
this
lets
you
run
several
clients
applications
and
move
the
display
around
from
one
to
the
other
olvwm

from
the

you
need
to
have

to
compile
it
get

there
are
three

can
i
use
my
favorite
window
manager
with
openwindows
instead
of
olwm
yes
if
you
use
twm
for
example
or
mwm
you
wont
be
able
to
use
the
pin
and
unpin
feature
of
olwm
and
you
probably
wont
see
the
footers
some
windows
use
to
display
certain
messages
if
you
use
twm
youll
want
to
use
the
fdelete
function
to
unpin
menus
and
get
rid
of
programs
that
dont
have
a
quit
button
when
not
run
under

put

subject
openwindows

olvwm
without

on
an

the
openwindows
xnews
server
combines
sunview
news
postscript
and
this
means
that
it
can
run
programs
compiled
for
any
of
those
systems
unfortunately
it
means
that
some
openwindows
programs
need
either
news
or
sunview
support
and
thus
wont
run
on
an
x
terminal
this
includes
pageview
in
particular
you
can
use
olwm

olvwm
see

on
an

most
open

you

subject
configuration

getting
started
with
openwindows
what
configuration
files
do
i
need
to
know
about
xinitrc
and
xsessionrc
the
first
time
you
run
openwindows
a
xinitrc
file
will
be
created
in
your
login
directory
home
if
it
already
exists
you
might
have
to
edit
it
somewhat
its
simplest
to
move
it
and
any
other
old
files
you
have
to
another
directory
and
then
merge
the
old
and
new
files
if
your
site
uses
xdm
you
should
use
xsession
instead
of
xinitrc
since
xdm
doesnt
look
at
your
xinitrc
file
openwininit
openwinmenu
and
openwinsys
these
are
optional
files
you
can
create
in
your
home
directory
depending
on
which
version
of
olwm
or
olvwm
you
use
look
in
openwinhomelib
normally
usropenwinlib
for
these
files
without
the
leading
and
copy
any
you
want
to
change
you
may
need
to
edit
your
xinitrc
to
get
them
recognized
if
you
are
not
on
an
x
terminal
you
will
want
to
run
a
console
window
such
as
cmdtool
c
shelltool
c
xterm
c
or
chuck
muscianos
contool
program
so
that
system
output
will
be
directed
there
instead
of
writing
over
your
screen
note
that
openwinsys
is
not
executed
unless
you
edit
xinitrc
xdefaults
you
can
put
x
windows
resource
specifications
in
here
in
particular
it
is
a
good
idea
to
include
at
least
openwindowsfocuslenience
true
input
true
these
allow
nonicccmcompliant
programs
to
receive
input
even
if
they
forget
to
ask
for
it
props
the
program
that
runs
when
you
select
properties
from
the
default
root
menu
under
olwm
or
olvwm
writes
your
choices
into
xdefaults
dont
put
comments
in
xdefaults
since
props
deletes
them
startupps
this
is
the
news
user
profile
file
read
by
openwindows
actually
xnews
on
startup
this
is
documented
in
the
news
programming
manual
near
the
back
the
most
useful
thing
to
put
here
is
postscript
code
to
change
the
keyboard
repeat
rate
although
you
must
be
very
careful
since
a
syntax
error
in
the
postscript
means
that
xnews
will
either
not
start
up
at
all
or
will
get
broken
in
strange
ways
the
news
manual
gives
code
that
is
both
incorrect
and
insufficient
warning
things
in
this
file
rarely
work
on
both
openwindows
and
note
that
the
mouse
speed
is
best

help
for
more
information
heres
what
homestartupps
should
look
like
if
you
want
a
delay
of
about
a
third
of
a
second
microseconds
and
a
repeat
rate
of
twenty
or
so
keys
per
second
microseconds
between
repeats
for
openwindows
youll
have
to
experiment
a
bit
because
the
repeattime
is
the
delay
between
keys
sent
and
thus
doesnt
include
the
time
to
process
each
key
which
is
probably
higher
on
my
than
on
your
supersparc
gti
injection
again
this
is
for
openwindows
dont
want

def

begin

note
and
differ

end
you
must
also
have
a

in
the

like
this

findpackage

tntcore
findpackage

tnt
findpackage

classrepeatkeys
pop
force

endpackage
endpackage
endpackage
if
you
change
these

you
can
test
them
without
restarting
the

server
like
this
psh
i
startupps
welcome

i

to
classinit
classrepeatkeys
send
now
press
controld
you
can
also
either
of
these
two
files
startupps
and
userps
to
make
the
root
window
be
retained
so
that
a
postscript
drawing
on
the
background
wont
be
erased
when
you
move
windows
frambuffer
retained
true
put
will
do
this
note
that
this
may
increase
the
amount

xnews
dramatically

you
can
use

occasional

props
a
property
editor
which
will
rewrite
your

after
removing
comments
it
then

any
changes
keep

commentfont
how
do
i
get
the
file
manager
to
use
emacs
instead
of
textedit
set
the

if
you
prefer
a
smaller
one
how
do
i
run
openwindows
in
inverse
video
this
tends
not
to
work
under
openwindows
with
opwnwindows
there
are
various
ways
including
using
bg
and
fg
options
if
youre
using
openwindows
on
a
sun
probably
the
best
you
can
do
short
of
upgrading
the
workstation
to
a
sparc
is
to
use
xterm
instead
of
cmdtool
why
dont
flat
checkboxes
work
a
known
bug
may
make
guides
output
dump
core
if
you
use
these
a
workaround
is
to
edit
the
guide
output
as
its
only
guides
output
thats
broken
not
the
actual
checkbox
code
this
applies
only
to
versions
of
devguide
before
devguide
if
youre
still
using
an
ancient
devguide
you
should
upgrade
as
soon
as
possible
the
new
one
is
fantastic
when
i
leave
openwindows
my
screen
goes
blank
or
my
mouse
cursor
stays
on
the
screen
try
running
clearcolormap
if
this
helps
put
it
as
the
last
line
in
the
shell
script
you
use
to
start
openwindows
eg
openwin
when
i
use
snapshot
the
system
crashes
or
the
server
hangs
or
something
this
was
a
bug
related
to
some
systems
only
the
only
workround
was
to
use
some
other
screen
dump
program
such
as
xwd
xv
or
xgrabsc
why
have
some
of
my
function
keys
stopped
working
keys
and
changed
from
and
to
and
respectively
in
openwindows
applications
must
be
recompiled
or
you
might
be
able
to
use
xmodmap
or
the
public
domain
xkeycaps
program
to
change
your
keyboard
layout
back
again
when
i
type
shelltool
or
cmdtool
or
textedit
i
get

note
that
openwindows
includes
the
core
distribution
to
patch
level
but
not
the
contrib
directory
these
notes
apply
to
openwindows
although
you
could
also
the
do
same
sort
of
thing
with
openwindows
and
install
the
libraries
in
you
can
intermix
openwindows
and
or
theyre
all
compatible
in
this
respect
put
the
binaries
in
for
example
put
last
in
your
path
so
that
you
get
openwindows
versions
of
programs
instead
of
ones
where
appropriate
although
this
is
a
matter
of
preference
in
any
event
put
the
openwindows
bin
directory
first
see
the
preceding
item
for
more
details
on
that
if
you
have
bin
or
usrbin
theyre
the
same
directory
on
sunos
earlier
in
your
path
than
openwinhomebinxview
youll
get
sunview
programs
instead
of
openwindows
ones
set
ldlibrarypath
so
that
usropenwinlib
is
last
after
the
library
directory
this
doesnt
matter
with
openwindows
but
with
older
versions
youll
get
error
messages
from
programs
if
you
dont
do
this
the
messages
are
generally
harmless
see
next
item
although
xdm
core
dumps
if
this
isnt
right
set
openwinhome
to
the
directory
containing
openwindows
if
it
isnt
usropenwin
see
also
environment
variables
especially
xfilesearchpath
i
get

messages
on
my

about

to
be

if
you
also
use
use
if
you
put
this
in
a

script
or
your

use

is
for

it
is

look

install
the

why
doesnt
answerbook
run
for
me
you
must
be
running
openwindows
to
use
answerbook
it
wont
run
under
on
an
x
terminal
or
on
anything
else
because
it
uses
news
to
draw
the
postscript
text
and
pictures
if
you
are
using
openwindows
you
need
to
use
the
openwindows
compatible
navigator
its
called
on
the
answerbook
cdrom
if
all
answerbook
users
are
using
openwindows
you
can
replace
navigator
wih
altogether
rename
the
old
one
first
to
satisfy
your
sense
of
paranoia
the
binary
is
also
on
cdware
vol
note
that
the
data
files
are
in
postscript
so
you
can
look

out

the

by

a
balancing
act
between

and
useful

at
this
point
most

the
best
candidate
for
a
speedy
window
manager
a
couple
of
generic
tricks
you
can
try
to
soup
up
your
window
manger
is
turning
off
unnecessary
things
like
zooming
and
opaque
move
also
if
you
lay
out
your

in

manner
you
reduce

spent

ive
found
that
a
good

for

make

that
your

is
a
proper
match
for
your
hardware
if
you
have
a
monochrome
monitor
use
a
monochrome
server
on
my
monochrome
sun
i
havent
noticed
much
difference
between
the
xsun
colour
server
and
xsunmono
however
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
xsunmono
is
about
smaller
and
therefore
should
contribute
to
less

how
your
server
was
compiled
can
also
make
a
difference
jeff
law
lawschirfcsutahedu
advises
us
that
on
a
sun
system
x
should
be
compiled
with
gcc
version
or
with
the
unbundled
sun
compiler
you
can
expect
to
get
very
large
speedups
in
the
server
by
not
using
the
bundled
sunos
compiler
i
assume
that
similar
results
would
occur
if
you
used
one
of
the
other
highquality
commercial
compilers
on
the
market
locking
the
server
into
ram
has
anyone
tried
hacking
the
x
server
so
that
it
is
locked
into
ram
and
does
not
get
paged
eg
via
a
call
to
plock
does
this
help
performance
at
all
ive
had
one
inquiry
on
this
topic
and
a
few
pointers
to
the
plock
function
call
but
no
hard
evidence
from
someone
whos
tried
it
i
am
not
in

starting
your
server
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
if
you
start
up
a
lot
of
clients
in
your
xsession
or
whatever
sleep
for
a
second
or
two
after
launching
each
one
after
i
changed
my
xclients
script
to
do
this
logging
in
actually
took
less
time
we
have
a
heavily
loaded
system
without
much
core
though
this
sounds
crazy
but
i
have
confirmed
that
it
works
warner
losh
impsolbournecom
provided
me
with
a
good
explanation
of
why
this
works
which
i
have
summarized
here
when
you
start
up
an
x
server
it
takes
a
huge
amount
of
time
to
start
accepting
connections
a
lot
of
initialization
is
done
by
the
server
when
it
starts
this
process
touches
a
large
number
of
pages
any
other
process
running
at
the
same
time
would
fight
the
server
for
use
of
the
cpu
and
more
importantly
memory
if
you
put
a
sleep
in
there
you
give
the
server
a
chance
to
get
itself
sorted
out
before
the
clients
start
up
similarly
there
is
also
a
lot
of
initialization
whenever
an
x
client
program
starts
toolkits
registering
widgets
resources
being
fetched
programs
initializing
state
and
databases
and
so
forth
all
this
activity
is
typically
memory
intensive
once
this
initialization
is
done
the
process
has
reached
a
steady
state
the
memory
usage
typically
settles
down
to
using
only
a
few
pages
by
using
sleeps
to
stagger
the
launching
of
your
clients
in
your
xinitrc
you
avoid
them
fighting
each
other
for
your
workstations
limited
resources
this
is
most
definitely
a
your
mileage
may
vary
situation
as
there
are
so
many
variables
to
be
considered
available
ram
local
swap
space
load
average
number
of
users
on
your
system
which
clients
you
are
starting
etc
currently
in
my
xinitrc
i
have
a
situation
like
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
experimented
with
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
even
tried
sleep
exec
startxclientsscript
and
then
in
startxclientsscript
i
had
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
the
idea
with
this
last
one
was
to
make
sure
that
xinit
had
completely
finished
processing
my
xinitrc
and
had
settled
down
into
a
steady
state
before
the
sleep
expired
and
all
my
clients
were
launched
all
of
these
yielded
fairly
comparable
results
and
so
i
just
stuck
with
my
current
setup
for
its
simplicity
you
will
probably
have
to
experiment
a
bit
to
find
a
setup
which
suits
you
fonts
loading
fonts
takes
time
and
ram
if
you
minimize
the
number
of
fonts
your
applications
use
youll
get
speed
increases
in
loadup
time
one
simple
strategy
is
to
choose
a
small
number
of
fonts
one
small
one
large
one
roman
whatever
suits
you
and
configure
all
your
clients
or
at
least
all
your
heavily
used
clients
to
use
only
those
few
fonts
client
programs
should
start
up
quicker
if
their
font
is
already
loaded
into
the
server
this
will
also
conserve
server
resources
since
fewer
fonts
will
be
loaded
by
the
server

eg
my
main
xterm
font
is
so
i
also
have
twm
set
up
to
use
in
all
its
menus
and
icons
etc
twms
default
font
is
since
i
dont
normally
use
ive
eliminated
one
font
from
my
server
oliver
jones
ojroadrunnerpictelcom
keep
fonts
local
to
the
workstation
rather
than
loading
them
over
nfs
if
you
will
make
extensive
use
of
scalable
fonts
use
a
font
server
about
the
resources
file
keep
your
xresources
xdefaults
file
small
saves
ram
and
saves
on
server
startup
time
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
one
suggestion
in
your
xdefaults
xresources
file
try
putting
only
the
minimum
number
of
resources
that
you
want
to
have
available
to
all
of
your
applications
for
example
reversevideo
true
then
separate
your
resources
into
individual
clientspecific
resource
files
for
example
homelibappdefaults
in
your
login
file
set
the
environment
variable
xuserfilesearchpath
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
homelibappdefaultsn
the
compwindowsx
frequently
asked
questions
faq
contains
an
excellent
explanation
of
how
these
environment
variables
work
ed
so
when
xterm
launches
it
loads
its
resources
from
appdefaultsxterm
xdvi
finds
them
in
appdefaultsxdvi
and
so
on
and
so
forth
note
that
not
all
clients
follow
the
same
xxxxx
resourcefile
naming
pattern
you
can
check
in
your
system
appdefaults
directory
often
to
find
the
proper
name
and
then
name
your
personal
resource
files
with
the
same
name
this
is
all
documented
in
the
xt
specification

long
mikeleecornelledu
kevin
is
willing
mail
his
setup
files
to
inquirers
this
method
of
organizing
your
personal
resources
has
the
following
benefits
easier
to
maintain
more
usable
fewer
resources
are
stored
in
the
x
server
in
the
resourcemanager
property
as
a
side
benefit
your
server
may
start
fractionally
quicker
since
it
doesnt
have
to
load
all
your
resources
applications
only
process
their
own
resources
never
have
to
sort
through
all
of
your
resources
to
find
the
ones
that
affect
them
it
also
has
drawbacks
the
application
that
you
are
interested
in
has
to
load
an
additional
file
every
time
it
starts
up
this
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
much
of
a
performance
difference
and
you
might
consider
this
a
huge
boon
to
usability
if
you
are
modifying
an
applications
resource
database
you
just
need
to
rerun
the
application
without
having
to
xrdb
again
xrdb
will
by
default
run
your
xdefaults
file
through
cpp
when
your
resources
are
split
out
into
multiple
resource
files
and
then
loaded
by
the
individual
client
programs
they
will
not
watch
out
for
this
i
had
c
style
comments
in
my
xdefaults
file
which
cpp
stripped
out
when
i
switched
to
this
method
of
distributed
resource
files
i
spent
several
frustrating
days
trying
to
figure
out
why
my
clients
were
not
finding
their
resources
xt
did
not
provide
any
error
message
when
it
encountered
the
c
style
comments
in
the
resource
files
it
simply
silently
aborted
processing
the
resource
file
the
loss
of
preprocessing
which
can
be
very
handy
eg
ifdef
color
is
enough
to
cause
some
people
to
dismiss
this
method
of
resource
management
you
may
also
run
into
some
clients
which
break
the
rules
for
example
neither
emacs
nor
xvt
will
find
their
resources
if
they
are
anywhere
other
than
in
xdefaults
when
starting
up
a
client
on
a
machine
that
does
not
share
files
with
the
machine
where
your
resources
are
stored
your
client
will
not
find
its
resources
loading
all
your
resources
into
the
server
will
guarantee
that
all
of
your
clients
will
always
find
their
resources
casey
leedom
caseygaussllnlgov
a
possible
compromise
suggestion
that
i
have
and
am
planning
on
trying
is
to
put
resources
for
all
my
heavily
used
clients
eg
xterm
into
my
xdefaults
file
and
to
use
the
separate
resources
files
method
for
clients
that
i
seldom
use
define
your
display
properly
client
programs
are
often
executed
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
in
that
situation
rather
than
setting
your
display
environment
variable
to
where
hostname
is
the
name
of
your
workstation
you
should
set
your
display
variable
to
or
by
doing
this
you
access
optimized
routines
that
know
that
the
server
is
on
the
same
machine
and
use
a
shared
memory
method
of
transferring
requests

not

ed
clients
if
you
only
have
a
few
megabytes
of
ram
then
you
should
think
carefully
about
the
number
of
programs
you
are
running
think
also
about
the
kind
of
programs
you
are
running
for
example
is
there
a
smaller
clock
program
than
xclock
unfortunately
i
havent
really
noticed
that
programs
advertise
how
large
they
are
so
the
onus
is
on
us
to
do
the
research
and
spread
the
word
suggestions
on
better
alternatives
to
the
some
of
the
standard
clients
eg
xclock
xterm
xbiff
are
welcome
ed
ive
received
some
contradictory
advice
from
people
on
the
subject
of
x
client
programs
some
advocate
the
use
of
programs
that
are
strictly
xlib
based
since
xt
xaw
and
other
toolkits
are
rather
large
others
warn
us
that
other
applications
which
you
are
using
may
have
already
loaded
up
one
or
more
of
these
shared
libraries
in
this
case
using
a
nonxt
for
example
client
program
may
actually
increase
the
amount
of
ram
consumed
the
upshot
of
all
this
seems
to
be
dont
mix
toolkits
that
is
try
and
use
just
athena
clients
or
just
xview
clients
or
just
motif
clients
etc
if
you
use
more
than
one
then
youre
dragging
in
more
than
one
toolkit
library
know
your
environment
and
think
carefully
about
which
client
programs
would
work
best
together
in
that
environment

xvt
suggested
by
richard
hesketh
available
exportlcsmitedu
in
if
you
dont
need
all
the
esoteric
features
of
xterm
then
get
hold
of
xvt
it
was
written
here
just
to
save
swap
space
as
xterm
is
rather
a
hog
this
was
written
as
a
partial
clone
of
xterm
you
dont
have
to
rename
your
resources
as
xvt
pretends
to
be
xterm
in
its
current
version
you
cannot
bind
keys
as
you
can
in
xterm
ive
heard
that
there
are
versions
of
xvt
with
this
feature
but
ive
not
found
any
yet
update
march
i
recently
had
a
few
email
conversations
with
brian
warkentin
brianwarkentineengsuncom
regarding
xvt
he
questions
whether
xvt
really
is
at
all
faster
than
xterm
for
instance
xvt
may
initialize
slightly
faster
but
compare
scrolling
speed
try
this
quickie
benchmark
bintime
dd
ifetctermcap
and
see
which
program
can
scroll
faster
also
while
xterm
may
be
slightly
larger
in
ram
requirements
we
dont
have
any
hard
numbers
here
does
anyone
else
shared
libraries
and
shared
text
segments
mean
that
xterms
paging
requirements
are
not
that
major
as
an
experiment
he
ripped
out
all
the
tek
stuff
from
xterm
but
it
made
little
difference
since
if
you
never
use
it
it
never
gets
brought
into
memory
so
here
we
stand
with
some
conflicting
reports
on
the
validity
of
xvt
over
xterm
in
summary
caveat
emptor
your
mileage
may
vary
if
you
can
provide
some
hard
data
id
like
to
see
it
specifically
how
much
ram
each
occupies
how

your

programs
to

from
scott
barman
scottasdcom
comes
a
suggestion
regarding
motif
text
field
widgets
i
noticed
that
during
data
entry
into
motif
text
field
widgets
i
was
getting
a
slight
lag
in
response
to
some
keystrokes
particularly
the
initial
one
in
the
field
examining
the
what
was
going
on
with
xscope
i
found
it
it
seems
that
when
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
is
nonzero
and
the
focus
is
on
a
text
field
widget
or
even
just
a
text
widget
the
ibeam
cursor
will
blink
every
time
the
cursor
appears
or
disappears
in
those
widgets
the
widget
code
is
making
a
request
to
the
server
copyarea
the
user
can
stop
this
by
setting
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
to
it
is
not
noticeable
on
a
sparc
but
it
does
make
a
little
difference
on
a
slower
system
this
specific
suggestion
can
probably
be
applied
in
general
to
lots
of
areas
consider
your
heavily
used
clients
are
there
any
minor
embellishments
that
can
be
turned
off
and
thereby
save
on
server
requests
miscellaneous
suggestions
pretty
pictures
dont
use
large
bitmaps
gifs
etc
as
root
window
backgrounds
the
more
complicated
your
root
window
bitmap
the
slower
the
server
is
at
redrawing
your
screen
when
you
reposition
windows
or
redraw
etc
these
take
up
ram
and
cpu
power
i
work
on
a
sun
sparc
and
im
conscious
of
performance
issues
i
cant
comprehend
it
when
i
see
people
with
a
sun
running
xphoon
as
their
root
window
ill
let
someone
else
figure
out
how
much
ram
would
be
occupied
by
having
a
full
screen
root
image
on
a
colour
workstation
if
youre
anything
like
me
you
need
all
the
screen
real
estate
that
you
can
get
for
clients
and
so
rarely
see
the
root
window
anyway

to
speed
up
applications
that
youre
developing
there
are
tons
of
things
you
can
do
some
that
stick
out
for
motif
programs
dont
set
xmfontlist
resources
for
individual
buttons
labels
lists
et
al
use
the
defaultfontlist
or
labelfontlist
or
whatever
resource
of
the
highestlevel
manager
widget
again
stick
to
as
few
fonts
as
possible
better
yet
dont
use
motif
at
all
its
an
absolute
pig
dont
create
and
destroy
widgets
on
the
fly
try
to
reuse
them
this
will
avoid
many
problems
with
buggy
toolkits
too
use
a
line
width
of
in
gcs
on
some
servers
this
makes
a
huge
difference
compress
and
collapse
multiple
expose
events
this
can
make
the
difference
between
a
fast
application
and
a
completely
unusable

just
a
small
remark
i
once
heard
that
using
a
better
malloc
function
would
greatly
increase
performance
of
xt
based
applications
since
they
use
malloc
heavily
they
suggested
trying
out
the
gnuy
malloc
but
i
didnt
find
the
time
yet
i
did
some
tests
on
small
programs
just
doing
malloc
and
free
and
the
differences
were
indeed
very
noticeable
somewhat
times
faster
any
confirmation
on
this
from
anyone
ed
andre
beck
andrebeckirsinftudresdende
unnecessary
noexpose
events
most
people
use
xcopyareaxcopyplane
as
fastest
blit
routines
but
they
forget
to
reset
graphicsexposures
in
the
gc
used
for
the
blits
this
will
cause
a
noexpose
event
every
blit
that
in
most
cases
only
puts
load
onto
the
connection
and
forces
the
client
to
run
through
its
eventloop
again
and
again
thousands
of
xchangegc
requests
this
gfx
context
switching
is
also
seen
in
most
handcoded
xapps
where
only
one
or
few
gcs
are
created
and
then
heavily
changed
again
and
again
xt
uses
a
definitely
better
mechanism
by
caching
and
sharing
a
lot
of
gcs
with
all
needed
parameters
this
will
remove
the
load
of
subsequent
xchangegc
requests
from
the
connection
by
moving
it
toward
the
client
startup
phase
say
what
some

proposed

the
server

are
competing
for
the
same
cpu
as
your

when
you
run
it
on

not
really
a
major
problem
except
that
the
client
and
the
server
are
in
absolute
synchronicity
and
are
context
thrashing
timothy
h
panton
thpwesthawkuucp
firstly
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
most
cpus
are
mostly
idle
xs
cpu
usage
is
bursty
so
the
chances
of
you
and
your
teammate
doing
something
cpuintensive
at
the
same
time
is
small
if
they
are
not
then
you
get
twice
the
cpumemory
available
for
your
action
the
second
factor
is
that
context
switches
are
expensive
using
cpus
halves
them
you
pay
a
price
due
to
the
overhead
of
going
over
the
network
but
this
is
offset
in
most
cases
by
the
improved
buffering
of
a
network
typically
vs
for
a

even
fewer

a
greythe
oval
tries
to
redraw
itself

gets
clipped
i
can

the
right
size
if
i
could
see
all
of
it
but
it
only
shows
up
in
the
region
that
was

painting
with
increasing
resolution
some
people
working
a
few
cubes
over
have
come
up
with
this
need
and
it
seems
that
someone
out
there
just
might
have
done
it
already
and
can
point
me
to
some
tools
that
would
help
what
theyd
like
to
do
is
given
a
window
that
is
taking
a
long
time
to
draw
because
either
the
data
is
arriving
over
a
slow
link
or
the
display
is
across
a
slow
link
they
would
like
to
first
paint
a
lowresolution
version
of
the
picture
and
then
repaint
it
in
higher
resolution
thus
the
picture
might
first
be
generated
in
resolution
with
each
square
of
pixels
being
filled
in
with
a
single
color
next
each
square
would
be
replaced
by
squares
finally
the
version
would
be
painted
since
one
of
the
scenarios
is
with
the
window
being
on
the
other
side
of
a
slow
link
the
lowres
version
obviously
wouldnt
be
transmitted
as
a
bitmap
that
wouldnt
help
at
all
instead
there
would
have
to
be
a
process
on
the
far
end
that
receives
the
lowres
picture
as
a
small
bitmap
and
blows
up
each
pixel
into
a
square
sorta
like
the
magnifier
programs
do
this
brings
up
the
question
of
whether
the
x
server
can
help
that
is
when
a
window
is
opened
is
there
a
way
to
ask
that
a
filter
program
be
run
to
process
the
pixels
or
is
the
only
way
to
use
something
like
rsh
to
start
up
a
remote
process
permission
denied
and
have
it
open
a
local
window
it
seems
the
most
likely
scenario
is
a
library
routine
that
starts
up
such
a
program
remotely
and
then
accepts
bitmaps
compressing
each
one
by
some
amount
and
sending
them
to
the
remote
program
to
expand
but

this
is
how

the

that
they

if

will
find

ever
since
i
started
to
use
xwindows
which
is
to
say
recently
ive
accumulated
a
few
questions
about
xapplications
three
examples
follow
it
was
recently
mentioned
on
composlinux
that
there
exists
a
post
script
viewer
i
am
interested
in
this
and
any
xeditor
that
is
an
improvement
on
xedit
which
i
find
annoying
try
to
get
axe
its
a
wonderful
x
based
editor
and
much
simpler
to
use
than
emacs
what
is
a
overkill
of
course
emacs
is
no
editor
but
a
religion
at
one
point
i
was
the
proud
owner
of
an
amiga
and
have
since
upgraded
to
a
workbench
the
pointand
click
interface
used
info
files
to
store
the
data
for
icons
associated
with
applications
on
a
given
volume
i
have
noticed
no
such
architecture
anywhere
under
linux
how
does
xwindows
associate
icons
with
applications
can
one
edit
icons
or
generate
new
ones
for
applications
somehow
if
it
makes
a
difference
im
running
twm
dont
call
going
from
an
amiga
to
a
ibm
upgrade
the
amiga
workbench
did
the
job
of
a
desktop
manager
and
there
is
no
really
amazing
good
x
desktop
manager
in
the
public
domain
im
currently
writing
one
but
its
in
very
early
stage
xdtm
may
be
a
medium
good
replacement
x
associates
icons
with
nothing
a
number
of
x
window
managers
associate
icons
with
windows
in
a
way
to
ease
window
management
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
icons
of
a
desktop
manager
application
the
tool
bitmap
is
there
for
simple
icon
drawing
ive
noticed
some
people
have
somehow
discovered
a
way
to
display
gif
or
some
kind
of
picture
files
in
the
background
either
replacing
or
overlapping
some
the
usual
grey
background
employed
by
xwindows
i
heard
this
was
done
using
some
application
but
i
dont

it

hi
all
this

hope
this

going

people
im

that
allows
me
to

the

heres
a

i
came
accross

this
question
seems
to
come
up
often
enough
that
i
figured
this

note
that
the

what

come
up

bold

the

fonts
which
seem
to
meet
these

are
a

one
is
bold

the

works

this

if

have

you
could
get

i
can
email
it
to
you
if
you
dont
have
it
or
dont
have
easy
access
to
the
x
source
and
could
make
your
own
bold
font
from
this
since
each
glyph
is
just
a
bitmap
you
could
write
a
program
to
convert
each
glyph
to
a

file
use
bitmap
to
make
each
glyph
bold
and
convert
the
results
back
to

then
use
bdftopcf
to
create
the

then
stick

a
little

specifically
make

it
needs
to
use
any

isnt
surprising
since

in
various
places
under

xaw
files
are
in
actually
the
real
problem
is
that
i
know
squat
about
imake
and
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
imake
where
the
files
are
i
can
see
from
the
makefile
that
its
looking
in
the
wrong
places
but
the
first
line
of
the
makefile
reads
makefile
generated
by
imake
do
not
edit
help
is
there
some
way
i
can
edit
the

to
tell
it
where
to
look
i

xm
is
a
user
interface
framework
for
the
c
language
built
upon
and
the
xtoolkit
it
is
designed
to
be
a
simple
and
intuitive
programming
interface
to
access
the
functionality
of
commonly
used
widgets
xm
was
initially
created
for
the
motif
widget
set
now
support
for
the
athena
widgets
was
added
applications
created
with
xm
run
in
both
environments
without
changes
although
many
nice
features
are
only
available
when
using
motif
in
some
situations
xm
extends
the
underlying
toolkit
ie
providing
a
combobox
borrowed
from
mswindows
but
never
tries
to
replace
it
data
of
user
interface
objects
is
left
to
the
widgets
and
only
duplicated
in
rare
cases
xm
has
nothing
common
with
motif
besides
the
general
idea
to
encapsulate
motif
widgets
in
c
objects
and
the
in
its
name
many
ideas
for
the
xm
architecture
came
from
digitalks
smalltalk
version
which
provides
an
easy
to
use
framework
for
windowspmmac
applications
in
the
very
first
time
of
development
i
used
the
windows
dialog
editor
and
a
simple
parser
to
create
similar
smalltalk
and
xm
dialogs
top
level
objects
in
xm
windows
systemdialogs
and
toolboxes
which
use
the
automatic
layout
feature
of
various
composite
widgets
in
motif
and
xaw
userdialogs
which
can
be
individually
laid
out
with
a
user
interface
builder
a
first
version
of
such
a
dialog
editor
is
included
in
this

controls
children
of

bw
xbitmap
format
or
color
gif
format
pictures
as
an
alternative
to
a
label
text
event
handling
is
done
by
a
simple
but
powerful
mechanism
which
redirects
xt
callbacks
to
member
functions
of
xm
objects
commoninteractii
is
built
upon
the
xm
drawing
class
and
provides
components
for
building
direct
manipulative
applications
is
is
a
very
simplified
implementation
of
some
features
from
the
commoninteract
system
research
project
of
our
institute
in
an
approach
to
define
a
software
achitecture
for
implementing
direct
manipulative
applications
with
multiple
interaction
media
ie
sound
alternative
input
devices
if
you
are
interrested
look
into
the
june
issue
of
the
joop
sigs
publications
journal
of
object
oriented
programming
there
should
be
our
paper
about
commoninteract
but
be
aware
that
it
is
our
state
of
the
art
from
commoninteractii
is
still
undocumented
and
is
included
because
it
was
used
to
implement
the
dialog
editor
it
currently
supports
only
drawing
primitives
lines
rectangles
circles
but
we
plan
to
extend
it
to
support
bitmaps
and
some
controls
also
known
problem
the
xm
drawing
class
has
no
redrawing
strategy
always
redraws
the
whole
window
even
after
minimal
changes
like
selecting
an
object
this
looks
very
ugly
on
slow
displays
and
should
be
fixed
about
this
first
release
xm
is
still
incomplete
and
has
a
lot
of
bugs
but
we
are
using
it
here
for
smaller
applications
which
are
running
without
problems
so
i
think
i
can
call
it
a
beta
release
which
can
be
used
to
develop
applications
for
any
noncritical
purposes
commoninteract
may
be
called
a
pre
alpha
release
its
development
will
be
continued
this
year
because
we
plan
to
use
it
for
another
research
project
here
besides
incompleteness
and
the
redrawing
problem
it
seems
to
be
stable
and
can
be
used
for
experimental
applications
platforms

oh
boy
have
i
wanted
this
too
however
i
believe
that
the
cursor
will
be
under
the
servers
control
could
be
wrong
on
an
xterminal
for
example
if
the
server
was
not
the
one
controlling
the
cursor
then
trying
to
get
the
xterm
application
to
do
the
blinking
would
cause
needless
and
yucky
network
overhead
consistantly
most
people
who
write
cursor
blinking
code
just
implement
the
simple
case
a
straight
or
so
onoff
cycle
however
the
cursor
will
work
much
better
if
cursor
blinking
is
suppressed
ie
the
cursor
is
made
visible
any
time
the
cursor
moves
and
for
to
sec
thereafter
if
you
dont
do
this
the
cursor
will
be
hard
to
track
when
in
motion
you
allways
could
port
and
use
emu
from
exportlcsmiteducontribemutarz
weve
implemented
a
blinking
text
cursor
for
the
very
reasons
people
mentioned
you
can
even
configure
the
actual
size
of
the
text
cursor
horizontal
ver
tical
line
cursors
smaller
block
cursors
turn
on
and
off
blinking
set
the
blink
rate
and
so
on
you
even
get
blinking
text
ok
enough
advertising
i
havent
looked
at
the
xterm
code
in
this
respect
but
from
the
memories
i
have
when
we
had
to
decide
whether
to
start
with
xterm
and
make
it
do
what
we
wanted
mostly
the
blinking
text
id
say
it
wont
be
easy
since
xterm
is
a
hairy
mess
understandable
if
you
follow
its
roots
back
to
the
actual
task
to
get
the
cursor
to
blink
isnt
that
difficult
if
you
provide
the
right
hooks
as
antonio
mentioned
youll
have
to
show
the
cursor
directly
after
it
has
moved
or
people
will
become
confused
since
its
a
good
idea
to
take
the
cursor
off
the
screen
when
you
do
anything
on
screen
anyways
this
isnt
very
complicated
youll
just
have
to
start
the
blink
process
with
the
cursor
showing
directly
after
its
mapped
as
for
the
portability
of
emu
and
its
newest
version
the
one
on
export
is
still
the
same
as
on
the
contrib
tape
we
wanted
to
get
out
a
new
release
for
over
six
months
now
but
unfortunately
were
drowning
in
work
but
since
the
changes
arent
affectiong
emus
behavior
much
id
say
whoever
wants
to
try
emu
shouldnt
wait
for
a
new
version
as
is
emu
wont
work
on
bsd
derived
systems
eg
suns
with
anything
else
than
a
csh
there
is
a
fix
to
this
which
is
very
short
remove
one
line
of

put
this

non

the

method
as

the
manual
shown
above
is
safe
from
the
view
of
other
users
wrap
it
as
part
of
the
term
environment
variable
this
method
uses
the
fact
that
most
remote
command
executors
do
pass
the
term
environment
variable
to
the
remote
host
it
is
then
a
matter
of
an
appropiate
script
in
your
remote
login
file
to
extract
the
information
from
the
term
environment
variable
and
set
up
things
appropiatly
a
version
of
the
xrlogin
script
is
available
on
the
network
which
does
this
basically
you
change
the
term
environment
variable
before
the
actual
call
to
rlogin
is
performed
to
include
your
display
and
your
authorization
on
the
remote
machine
you
then
extract
this
information
and
return
the
term
environment
variable
to
normal
before
you
use
it
for
reseting
or
sttying
your
terminal
script
for
launching

you
have

note
that
if
the

then
authorization
is
automatically

hoever
you
will
still

cat
finger
for

this
involves
encrypting
the
information
into
your
plan
or
project
and
having
the
remote
machine
finger
for
the
information
this
has
the
disadvantage
of
having
the
information
to
anyone
fingering
the
user
thus
requiring
a
encryption
method
that
is
uniq
to
each
individual
ie
the
method
of
decyrption
must
not
be
shared
or
known
by
others
nor
should
it
be
easy
to
determine
a
improvment
is
to
use
the
who
fingered
me
technique
to
only
give
the
information
only
to
your
own
remote
accounts
and
not
just
to
anyone
who
is
asking
this
last
method
was
developed
last
year
by
a
second
year
here
untill
i
explained
to
him
the
need
for
the
encryption
at
which
point
he
gave
up
this
method
it
is
however
a
valid
method
it
is
easer
than
but
less
secure

there

two

to
connect
application
code
to

callbacks

actions
the
problem
i
face
now
is
that
i
have
a

long
piece

application
code
that
performs
a
lot
of
drawing
into

i
want
to
connect
this
to
a

no
problem
so
far
i
could
use
a
callback
function
or
an
action
to
do
this
processing
any
events
afterwards
but
because
the
drawing
takes
some
while
i
want
the
application
code
sequence
to
be
able
to
be
interrupted
by
events
then
i
want
to
handle
the
events
and
resume
with
processing
the
application
code
at
the
point
it
was
interrupted
it
seems
to
me
that
this
isnt
possible
but
how
can
i
give

the

are
immediately
processed

stopped
short
becuse

a

depends

that
you

you
go
ahead
and
write
a

for
your

using
the
basic
implementations
since
both
jordan
and
i
havent
encountered
a

yet
that
is
fully
posix
we
havent
gotten
around
to
really
implement

test
a

specifically
for
just
posix
the
posix
routines
are
used
in
the

ttysuni
for
example
but
here
we
also
use
some
bsd
stuff
all
in
all
it
still
is
probably
better
to
implement
a
include

for
each

every
operating

ifdefing
in
existing
ones
the
type
of
mess
that
can

even
if
quite
a

will

it
shouldnt

up

is
when

i
setup
the

then
execute

nothing
happens
i

is
an

may
find
that
their

there
is
no

this

to

whatever
describes
its

palettes
can
be
shared

they
only
contain
descriptive
information
they
are
not
directly
tied
to
the
object
that
uses
them
palettes
are
held

a

can
accomadate
up
to
the
number
of
hardware
color
cells

color
descriptors
when
the
input
focus
is
in
a

that
widget
has
access
to
all
of
the

that
are
described
in

all

transiently
get

can

the

any

re

needed
callbacks
actions
and
events
i
understood
that
there
are
two
methods
to
connect
application
code
to
widgets
callbacks
and
actions
the
problem
i
face
now
is
that
i
have
a
quite
long
piece
of
application
code
that
performs
a
lot
of
drawing
into
a
window
i
want
to
connect
this
to
a
widget
no
problem
so
far
i
could
use
a
callback
function
or
an
action
to
do
this
processing
any
events
afterwards
but
because
the
drawing
takes
some
while
i
want
the
application
code
sequence
to
be
able
to
be
interrupted
by
events
then
i
want
to
handle
the
events
and
resume
with
processing
the
application
code
at
the
point
it
was
interrupted
it
seems
to
me
that
this
isnt
possible
but
how
can
i
give
the
user
the
impression
that
his
inputs
are
immediately
processed
use
a
workproc
see
you
should
split
your
drawing
routnie
up
into
small
chunks
this
is
the
hard
part
then
in
the
callback
that
starts
the
drawing
you
call
xtappaddworkproc
to
call
your
workproc
the
first
time
your
workproc
should
be
a
function
that
returns
a
boolean
true
when
you
are
finished
and
false
when
you
want
to
keep
processing
if
you
return
false
the
workproc
is
automatically
reinstalled
note
that
this
method
is
better
that
using
a
timeout
loop
since
events
get
processed
in
a
more
precedenceoriented
manner
if
you
are
using
the
same

bindings

makedepend

netters
we
have
a
problem
with
makedepend
it
doesnt
know
how
to
correctly
process
if
clause

statements
it
evaluates
everything
to
true
no
matter
what
the
conditionals
are
for

makedepend

if

include
stringh
define
index
strchr
define
rindex
strrchr
else
bsd
stdc
include
stringsh
endif
stdc
here
makedepend
evaluates
both
if
and
corresponding
else
statements
to
true
and
tries
to
open
the
file
stringsh
which
doesnt
exist
under
we
also
have
a
lot
of
if
statements
in
some
of
our
legacy
code
we
got
and
built
makedepend
off
the
net
it
didnt
fix
the
problem
in
all
fairness
it
should
be
noted
that
makdepend
manpage
suns
distribution
mentions
this
problem
bugs
if
you
do
not
have
the
source
for
cpp
the
berkeley
c
preprocessor
then
makedepend
will
be
compiled
in
such
a
way
that
all
if
directives
will
evaluate
to
true
regardless
of
their
actual
value
this
may
cause
the
wrong
include
directives
to
be
evaluated
makedepend
should
simply
have
its
own
parser
written
for
if
expressions
has
anybody
come
up
with
some

makdepend

we

c
as
it

not

developing

use

from

microsoft

to
be
evaluated
with

on
so
many
desktops
and
the
price

power
dropping
its
successor
needs
to
be
evaluated
as
corporations
begin
to
look
at
nt
so
must
their
developers

suppliers
the
mission
of
the
xhibition
technical
conferences
is
to
provide
information
to
the
application
developer
and
to
the
technology
planner
the
nt
conference
at

is
designed
to
do
just
that
we
worked
with
microsoft
to
provide
the
only
conference
this
year
specifically
designed
to
show
x

developers
the
capabilities
of

nt
if
you
arent

that
nt
has
what
you
need
for

this
is
the
place
to

out
ask
the
folks
from

get
them
to
show
you
what
you
need
conference
attendees
will
receive
nt

generally
to

for
yourself

this

ive
been
getting
mail
from
xhibition
about
the
june
conference
and
i
was
wondering
if
microsoft
had
bought
xhibition
the
front
says
conference
from
microsoft
windows
nt
developers
whats
the
deal
i
thought
xhibition
was
for
xwindows
jesse
w
asher
i
was
wondering
this
myself
and
not
surprisingly
when
you
look
at
the
audience
windows
nt
with
the
bulk
of
the
xhibition
audience
and
the
unix
community
developing
applications
for
inhouse
or
custom
use
a
new
operating
system
from
a
player
as
large
as
microsoft
needs
to
be
evaluated
with
ms
windows
on
so
many
desktops
and
the
price
of
computing
power
dropping
its
successor
needs
to
be
evaluated
as
corporations
begin
to
look
at
nt
so
must
their
developers
and
suppliers
what
you
need
conference
attendees
will
receive
nt
software
development
kits
to
bang
on
evaluate
and
generally
to
see
for
yourself
i
hope
this
doesnt
sound
like
an
nt
commercial
it
should
sound
like
an
xhibition
commercial
unfortunately
it
does
i
dont
agree
with
the
logic
of
nt
at
an
x
windows
conference
perhaps
some
good
will
come
of
it
but
the
two
are
so
dissimilar
and
the

i
dont

i
say
that
any

is
broken

however
the

in

the
point
here
is
that
if
you
try
to
display
some
ps
files
using
pageview
you
will
find
out
that
its
not
a
practical
tool
it
is
true
that
the

does
not

that
the

that
is
the
fault
of
the
left

not
knowing
what
the

is
doing
at
sun
i
was
informed
by
a
sun
employee
that
the
pageview
program
does
require
dsc
compliant
postscript
there
was
the
possibility
that
it
was
going
to
be
changed
so
that
if
the
file
wasnt
dsc
compliant
that
it
would
stop
at
each
showpage
i
believe
that
this
method
would
preclude
being
able
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
file
ie
you
could
only
go
forward
to
the
next
showpage
this
isnt

from
by

bernward
averwald
back
in
the
days
of
i
did
analyse
the
xterm
code
the
cursor
was
implemented
by
drawing
a
rectangle
around
the
character
i
doesnt
seem
to
be
changed
til
now
but
if
you
have
the
sources
you
could
add
a
blinking
cursor
via
xtappaddtimeout
or
similar
the
server
overhead
for
this
is
mildly
ridiculous
though
see
also
desqviewx
which
does
this
in
its
dos
windows
do
you
really
want
xterm
to
wake
up
every
half
second
and
whack
the
server
into
doing
a
bitblt
so
what
im
running
emu
on
a
mhz
box
i
cannot
make
out
any
difference
in
performance
whether
the
cursor
is
set
to
blinking
or
not
if
you
think
about
it
a
bit
a
cycle
of
ms
is
a
hell
a
lot
of
time
for
even
the
slowest
pc
since
you
would
of
course
only
enable
the
blinking
text
cursor
when
your
xterm
has
the
input
focus
this
application
is
active
anyway
to
repeat
it
a
blinking
text
cursor
costs
almost
nothing
in
performance
it
just
needs
some
thought
when
designing
the
xterm
software
you
are
stuck
in
a
distributed
system
feedback
loop
what
if
you
are
on
an
xterminal
or
running
xterm
over
the
net
to
another
machine
that
is
when
the
load
problems
occur
if
you
had
a
machine
with
xterminals
attached
and
they
all
had
blinking
cursors
in
xterms
this
could
represent
a
considerable

is
this

do

badwindow

an

if
you
write

the

will

help
hi
i
am
running
on
an
ibm
aix
and
on
a
sunos
since
i
run
x
on
both
colour
and
blackwhite
displays
i
need
different
values
for
the
same
resource
so
i
want
to
use
ifdef
color
in
my
application
defaults
files
however
cpp
is
only
invoked
by
xrdb
and
not
when
the
resources
are
loaded
on
demand
is
there
a
proper
solution
to
this
so
far
the
only
proper
solution
ive
come
to
think
of
is
to
create
different
files
in
my
appdefaults
say
xterm
and
xtermcolor
and
set
my
xfilesearchpath
to
either
hometn
or
hometncolor
but
that
does
not
always
seem
to
work
eg
executing
a
remote
shell
command
without
reading
the
cshrc
does
not
set
xfilesearchpath
furthermore
i
thought
of
using
include
xterm
in
xtermcolor
however
for
resources
in
xterm
that
i
want
to
override
in
xtermcolor
things
are
different
on
both
machines
on
a
sun
the
first
found
resource
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xterm
the
bw
one
while
on
an
the
last
found
value
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xtermcolor
what
can
i
do
about
it
i
have
one
last
question
for
the
specification
of
xfilesearchpath
i
can
use
t
n
c
and
s
t
stands
for
appdefaults
n
for
the
resource
class
but
what
do
c
and
s
stand
for

because

i

can

whether

bandwidth
is
unlikely
to

except
over
a
wet
string
network
one
of
major
flaws
of
x
is
the
horrendous
number
of
transactions
and
hence
process
switches
that
it
forces
upon
a
host
actual
measurements
hourly
average
are
per
second
per
logged
in
user
which
can
lead
to
or
more
process
switches
depending
on
whether
each
event
is
filtered
by
the
window
manager
as
well
as
the
applications
and
how
many
processes
are
needed
for
each
character
while
a
blinking
cursor
needs
only
the
application
and
the
networking
process
and
does
not
add
any
transactions
it
will
add
something
like
process
switches
per
second
per
user
this
is
a
significant
increase
in
overhead
especially
as
the
application
may
have
quite
a
large
working
set
if
you
want
a
rapidly
blinking
cursor
there
could
be
as
many
as
if
you
want
to
go
there

time
hyperhelp
can
use
the

this
allows

very
easily
xprinter
uses

this
lets
you
use
the
exact

code
for

there

on

hand
given

two
such

we
are
more
inclined

that

interesting
when

we
try

the

open

interpretation
as
in

life
x
programming
interpreting
a
requirements
document
or
a
customer
request
x
is
important
for
this
reason
we
often
award
worst
abuse
of
the
x
rules
to
an
entry
that
illustrates
this
point
in
an
ironic
way
x
x
if
you
do

abuse

we
suggest

you
let
us
know

in

note
that

is
not
an
invitation

break
we
are
strict
when
it
comes
to
the
x
byte
size
limit
also
abusing
the
entry
format
tends
to
x
annoy
more
than
amuse
x
x
we
do
realize
that
there
are
holes
in
the
rules

invite
entries
x
to
attempt
to
exploit
them
we
will
award
worst
abuse

x
and
then
plug
the
hole
next
year
even
so
we
will
attempt

use

the
smallest
plug
needed
if
not
smaller
x
x
check
out
your
program
and
be
sure
that
it
works
we
sometimes
make
x
the
effort
to
debug
an
entry
that
has
a
slight
problem
particularly
x
in
or
near
the
final
round
on
the
other
hand
we
have
seen
some
x
of
the
best

fall
down
because
they
didnt
work
x
x
we
tend
to
look
down
on
a

that
claims
that

is
a
prime
number
if
you
do
have
a
bug
you
are
better
off
x
documenting
it
noting
this
entry
sometimes
prints
the
power
x
of
a
prime
by
mistake
would
save
the

sometimes

a

even

serve
a
useful
purpose
they
are
often
the
only
program
that

attempt

completely
understand

this
reason
we
look
for

programs

one

be
short

x
unless

that
you
format
your

in

more
creative
way

simply
forming
excessively
long

x
x
the

not

get
around

it
is
one
thing
to
make
use

out

it
is
quite
another
to
use
bytes

in
order
to
x
try

squeeze
the
source
under

size
limit
you
should
feel
x
free
to
make

space
but
you
are
better
off

if
you
show
some
amount

restraint
x
x
we
allowed
whitespace
and
in
certain
cases
or
do
not
impact
x
your
program
size
up
to
a
certain
point
because
we
want
to
get
x
away
from

that
is
simply
a
compact
blob
of
characters
x
x
given
two
versions
of
the

program
one
that
is
a
compact
blob
x
of
code
and
the
other
that
is
formatted
more
like
a
typical
c
x
program
we
tend
to
favor
the
second
version

a
third
x
version
of
the

in
an
interesting

definitely
win

we
suggest

program
we
are
amazed

there

nothing

a

also
reexamine

an

two

process
we
perform
the
difficult
tasks
of

reducing
the
remaining

typically
about
down
to
or
x
winners
often
we
are
confident
that
the
entries
that
make
it
into

the
final
round
are
definitely
better
than
the
ones
that
do
not

make

selection

sometimes
a
final

entry
good
enough
to
win
but
is
beat
out
x
by
a
similar

slightly
better
entry
for
this
reason
it
is
x
sometimes
worthwhile
to
reenter
an
improved
version
of
an
entry
x
that
failed
to
win
in
a
previous
year
this
assumes
of
course
x
that
the
entry
is
worth
improving
in
the
first
place
x
x
more
often
that
not
we
select
a
small
entry
usually
one
line
a

strangecreative

entry
and
an
entry
that
abuses
the
contest
x
rules
in
some
way
x
x
in
the
end
we
traditionally
pick
one
entry
as
best
sometimes
such
x
an
entry
simply
far
exceeds
any
of
the
other
entry
more
often

why
does
my
application
core
dump
when
i
use
signalsalarmscthreads
in
brief
xlib
xt
and
most
widget
sets
have
no
mutual
exclusion
for
critical
sections
any
interrupt
handler
is
likely
to
leave
one
of
the
above
libraries
in
an
inconsistent
state
such
as
all
the
appropriate
flags
not
yet
set
dangling
pointers
in
the
middle
of
a
list
traversal
etc
note
that
the
ansi
c
standard
points
out
that
behavior
of
a
signal
handler
is
undefined
if
the
signal
handler
calls
any
function
other
than
signal
itself
so
this
is
not
a
problem
specific
to
xlib
and
xt
the
posix
specification
mentions
other
functions
which
may
be
called
safely
but
it
may
not
be
assumed
that
these
functions
are
called
by
xlib
or
xt
functions
the
only
safe
way
to
deal
with
signals
is
to
set
a
flag
in
the
interrupt
handler
this
flag
later
needs
to
be
checked
either
by
a
work
procedure
or
a
timeout
callback
it
is
incorrect
to
add
either
of
these
in
the
interrupt
handler
as
another
note
it
is
dangerous
to
add
a
work
procedure
that
never
finishes
this
effectively
preempts
any
work
procedures
previously
added
and
so
they
will
never
be
called
another
option
is
to
open
a
pipe
tell
the
event
loop
about
the
read
end
using
xtappaddinput
and
then
the
signal
handler
can
write
a
byte
to
the
write
end
of
the
pipe
for
each
signal
however
this
could
deadlock
your
process
if
the
pipe
fills
up
why
dont
the
intrinsics
deal
with
this
problem
primarily
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
portable
layer
to
any
hardware
and
operating
system
is
that
a
good
enough
reason
i
dont
think
so
note
the
article
in
the
x
journal
and
the
example
in
oreilly
volume
are
in
error
how
do
i
use
a
different
visual
than
the
default
this
requires
a
more
complicated
answer
than
it
should
a
window
has
three
things
that
are
visual
specific
the
visual
colormap
and
border
pixmap
all
widgets
have
their
own
colormap
and
borderpixmap
resource
only
shell
widgets
have
visual
resources
another
questions
deals
with
why
shells
have
a
visual
the
default
value
of
these
resources
is
copyfromparent
which
does
exactly
what
it
says
in
the
shell
widget
copyfromparent
gets
evalulated
as
defaultvisualofscreen
and
defaultcolormapofscreen
when
any
one
of
the
three
resources
is
not
properly
set
a
badmatch
error
occurs
when
the
window
is
created
they
are
not
properly
set
because
each
of
the
values
depends
on
the
visual
being
used
how
to
get
this
to
work
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer
the
first
is
if
you
want
an
application
to
start
with
a
particular
visual
and
the
second
is
if
you
want
a
particular
shell
within
an
application
to
start
with
a
different
visual
the
second
is
actually
easier
because
the
basic
information
you
need
is
available
the
first
is
a
little
harder
because
youll
need
to
initialize
much
of
the
toolkit
yourself
in
order
to
determine
the
needed
information
some
sample
code
to
start
up

return
which
visual
should
an
application
use
this
is
a
point
that
can
be
argued
about
but
one
opinion
is
there
is
no
way
for
an
application
to
know
the
appropriate
visual
it
has
to
be
specified
by
the
user
if
you
disagree
with
this
then
your
application
probably
falls
into
the
category
of
always
using
the
default
visual
or
it
is
hardware
specific
and
expects
some
particular
visual
such
as
truecolor
with
an
overlayplane
extension
or
some
such
why
no
application
runs
in
isolation
depending
on
the
way
a
server
allocates
resources
i
may
not
always
want
your
application
to
run
in
truecolor
mode
if
it
is
going
to
mess
up
my
other
applications
i
may
be
very
upset
if
it
chooses
to
run
in
greyscale
instead
of
psuedocolor
or
just
monochrome
as
an
example
on
a
low
end
color
sun
server
there
are
many
different
possible
visuals
monochrome
entry
colormap
static
gray
static
color
and
a
truecolor
the
sgi
iriss
offer
all
the
above
plus
bit
truecolor
bit
truecolor
an
overlay
plane
why
do
only
shell
widgets
have
a
visual
this
is
strictly
by
convention
it
makes
it
possible
for
an
arbitrary
widget
to
know
that
the
visual
it
uses
can
be
found
by
looking
for
the
shell
widget
that
is
its
ancestor
and
obtaining
the
visual
of
that
shell
a
widget
can
have
its
own
visual
resource
if
it
does
it
must
have
its
own
realize
method
to
use
the
visual
when
it
calls
xcreatewindow
you
should
also
make
this
a
resource
that
can
be
obtained
with
xtgetvalues
so
other
widgets
can
find
it
a
reasonable
value
is
probably
xtnvisual
which
visual
depth
and
colormap
do
shells
inherit
the
default
value
for
these
resources
are
set
to
copyfromparent
this
is
interpreted
as
the
defaultcolormapofscreen
defaultdepthofscreen
and
the
default
visual
of
the
screen
if
the
widget
has
no
parent
ie
it
is
an
applicationshellwidgetclass
and
the
root
of
your
widget
tree
if
the
parent
of
the
widget
is
not
null
then
the
shell
copies
colormap
and
depth
from
its
parent
and
uses
copyfromparent
as
the
visual
ive
done
all
the
above
and
i
still
get
a
badmatch
error
why
some
resource
converters
improperly
cache
references
this
was
especially
true
of
and
earlier
versions
of
motif
why
doesnt
my
widget
get
destroyed
when
i
call
xtdestroywidget
see
section
of
the
xt
specification
it
eventually
does
get
destroyed
just
not
immediately
the
intrinsics
destroy
a
widget
in
a
twophase
process
first
it
and
all
of
its
children
have
a
flag
set
that
indicate
it
is
being
destroyed
it
is
then
put
on
a
list
of
widgets
to
be
destroyed
this
way
any
pending
x
events
or
further
references
to
that
widget
can
be
cleaned
up
before
the
memory
is
actually
freed
the
second
phase
is
then
performed
after
all
callbacks
event
handlers
and
actions
have
completed
before
checking
for
the
next
x
event
at
this
point
the
list
is
traversed
and
each
widgets
memory
is
actually
freed
among
other
things
as
some
further
caveatstrivia
the
widgets
may
be
destroyed
if
the
intrinsics
determine
that
they
have
no
further
references
to
the
widgets
on
the
list
if
so
then
the
phase
destruction
occurs
immediately
also
if
nested
event
loops
are
used
widgets
placed
on
the
destroy
list
before
entering
the
inner
event
loop
are
not
destroyed
until
returning
to
the
outer
event
loop
how
do
i
exit
but
still
execute
the
destroycallbacks
the
problem
is
if
a
simple
and
entirely
reasonable
approach
to
exiting
an
application
is
used
such
as
calling
exit
directly
then
a
widget
may
not
have
a
chance
to
clean
up
any
external
state
such
as
open
sockets
temporary
files
allocated
x
resources
etc
this
code
for
simplicity
reasons
assumes
only
a
single
toplevel
widget

quickly
xtdestroywidget

exit
one
can
see
that
the
above
code
exits
immediately
after
destroying
the
toplevel
widget
the
trouble
is
the
phase
destruction
may
never
occur
this
works
for
most
widgets
and
most
applications
but
will
not
work
for
those
widgets
that
have
any
external
state
you
might
think
that
since
it
works
now
it
will
always
work
but
remember
that
part
of
the
reason
an
object
oriented
approach
is
used
is
so
one
can
be
ignorant
of
the
implementation
details
for
each
widget
which
means
that
the
widget
may
change
and
someday
require
that
some
external
state
is
cleaned
up
by
the
destroy
callbacks
one
alternative
is
to
modify
exitcallback
to
set
a
global
flag
and
then
test
for
that
flag
in
a
private
event
loop
however
private
event
loops
are
frowned
upon
because
it
tends
to
encourage
sloppy
and
difficult
to
maintain
practices

how
do
i
resize
a
shell
widget
after
it
is
realized
one
doesnt
resize
a
shell
widget
the
proper
thing
is
to
resize
the
currently
managed
child
of
the
shell
widget
using
xtsetvalues
the
geometry
change
is
then
propagated
to
the
shell
which
asks
the
window
manager
which
may
or
may
not
allow
the
request
however
the
shell
must
have
the
resource
xtnallowshellresize
set
to
true
otherwise
it
will
not
even
ask
the
window
manager
to
grant
the
request
and
the
shell
will
not
resize
to
change
the
position
of
a
shell
use
xtsetvalues
on
the
shell
not
the
child
and
within
the
limits
of
the
window
manager
it
should
be
granted
why
cant
xtappaddinput
handle
files
it
does
however
unix
semantics
for
when
io
is
ready
for
a
file
does
not
fit
most
peoples
intuitive
model
in
unix
terms
a
file
descriptor
is
ready
for
reading
whenever
the
read
call
would
not
block
ignoring
the
setting
of
optional
flags
that
indicate
not
to
block
this
works
as
expected
for
terminals
sockets
and
pipes
for
a
file
the
read
will
always
return
but
the
return
indicates
an
eof
ie
no
more
data
the
result
is
the
code
in
the
intrinsics
always
calls
the
input
handler
because
it
always
thinks
something
is
about
to
be
read
the
culprit
is
the
select
system
call
or
on
sysv
based
oss
it
is
the
poll
system
call
how
to
get
around
this
on
a
unix
system
the
best
approach
is
to
use
another
process
to
check
for
available
input
on
the
file
use
a
pipe
to
connect
the
application
with
this
other
process
and
pass
the
file
descriptor
from
the
pipe
to
xtappaddinput
a
suitable
program
on
bsd
systems
is
tail
f
filename
its
rumored
that
select
on
some
systems
is
not
completely
reliable
in
particular
ibm
aix
this
is
one
where
it
would
work
for
a
while
several
thousand
times
and
then
stop
until
some
other
event
woke
it
up
this
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
a
race
condition
in
the
kernel
ibm
claims
to
have
a
fix
for
this
pyramid
doesnt
work
at
all
ultrix
and
possibly
others
where
pipes
are
implemented
as
sockets
wasnt
completely
broken
but
although
the
writing
side
wrote
in
byte
blocks
the
reading
side
received
it
all
broken
up
as
if
it
was
being
put
into
the
pipe
a
byte
at
a
time
you
can
waste
a
lot
of
time
by
reading
small
blocks
get
raound
it
by
detecting
the
situation
and
having
select
ignore
the
pipe
for
mseconds
by
then
it
had
been
given
the
whole
block
note
that
all
the
above
descriptions
used
unix
terminology
such
as
read
file
descriptor
pipes
etc
this
is
an
os
dependent
area
and
may
not
be
identical
on
all
systems
however
the
intrinsic
designers
felt
it
was
a
common
enough
operation
that
it
should
be
included
with
part
of
the
toolkit
why
they
didnt
also
deal
with
signals
at
this
point

however
much
i

hopefully
some
alternative
will
develop
in
the
next

that
uses
an
object

language
keep
your
eyes
open
and
expect
some
change
about
the
same
time
a
language
other
than
c
starts
gaining
acceptance
how
do
i
pass
a
float
value
to

first
what
is
going
wrong
is
the
structure
for
an

essentially

arg
and
the
code
arg
arg
xtsetarg
arg

expands

arg

argvalue
you
can
see
that
with
normal
c
type
conversions
the
argvalue
gets
the
integer
instead
of
the
floating
point
value
when
the
value
is
copied
into
the

resource
the
bit
pattern
is
wildly
different
than
that
required

to
get

how
do
i
write
a
resource
converter
courtesy
of
rich
thomson
rthomsondsdescom
the
following
discussion
of
resource
converters
assumes
or
intrinsics
resource
converters
changed
between
and
to
allow
for
destructors
and
caching
of
converted
values
there
are
several
main
types
of
resource
converters
string
to
data
type
data
type
to
string
data
type
to
data
type
i
string
to
data
type
usually
a
string
to
data
type
converter
has
a
fixed
set
of
strings
that
will
be
converted
to
data
type
values
this
is
most
often
used
to
map
enumerated
names
to
enumerated
values
name
value
true
false
in
this
case
the
string
to
data
type
converter
needs
to
compare
the
resource
value
to
the
list
of
fixed
strings
this
is
most
readily
accomplished
by
the
use
of
the
quark
mechanism
of
the
resource
manager
the
resource
value
is
turned
into
a
quark
which
is
a
unique
representation
of
the
string
that
fits
into
a
single
word
then
the
resource
quark
is
compared
against
the
quarks
for
the
fixed
strings
representing
the
enumerated
values
if
there
are
many
enumerated
strings
in
the
converter
or
many
converters
each
with
a
small
number
of
enumeration
strings
then
a
global
initialization
routine
might
be
used
to
turn
all
the
resource
strings
into
quarks
that
way
the
first
time
one
of
these
converters
is
used
the
strings
will
be
turned
into
quarks
and
held
in
static
variables
for
use
in
the
next
invocation
of
one
of
the
converters
ii
data
type
to
string
this
type
of
converter
is
slightly
easier
than
the
string
to
data
type
converters
since
the
use
of
quarks
isnt
necessary
instead
the
data
type
value
is
simply
converted
to
a
string
value
probably
by
the
use
of
sprintf
data
type
to
string
converters
are
useful
for
applications
that
wish
to
convert
an
internal
data
type
value
into
a
string
so
that
they
can
write
out
a
valid
resource
specification
to
a
file
this
mechanism
can
be
used
to
provide
a
snapshot
of
application
state
into
a
file
this
snapshot
can
be
used
to
restore
the
program
to
a
known
state
via
the
usual
x
resource
database
mechanisms
if
you
are
taking
the
trouble
to
write
a
string
to
data
type
converter
it
isnt
much
extra
effort
to
write
the
data
type
to
string
converter
writing
both
at
the
same
time
helps
to
ensure
that
they
are
consistent
iii
data
type
to
data
type
this
type
of
converter
is
used
to
convert
an
existing
data
type
value
to
another
data
type
for
instance
an
x
pixel
value
can
be
converted
to
an
rgb
data
type
that
contains
separate
fields
for
red
green
and
blue
the
type
signature
for
a
resource
converter
is
as
follows
typedef
boolean
xttypeconverterdisplay
xrmvalueptr
cardinal
xrmvalueptr
xrmvalueptr
xtpointer
display
dpy
xrmvalueptr
args
cardinal
numargs
xrmvalueptr
fromval
xrmvalueptr
toval
xtpointer
converterdata
when
the
converter
is
invoked
the
fromval
argument
points
to
the
source
x
resource
manager
value
and
the
toval
argument
points
to
the
destination
x
resource
manager
value
the
converterdata
argument
is
an
opaque
pointer
to
some
converterspecific
data
that
is
specified
when
the
converter
is
registered
the
args
and
numargs
arguments
allow
extra
information
to
be
passed
to
the
converter
when
it
is
invoked
for
instance
the
pixel
to
rgb
structure
converter
discussed
above
would
need
colormap
and
visual
arguments
in
which
to
lookup
the
pixel
to
obtain
the
rgb
values
corresponding
to
that
pixel
care
must
be
taken
with
the
toval
argument
an
xrmvalue
has
the
following
type
definition
and
specifies
a
size
and
location

a

value
typedef
struct
unsigned
int

caddrt
addr
xrmvalue
xrmvalueptr
when
the
converter
is
invoked
the
address
may
point
to
a
location
of
the
given
size
for
the
converted
value
or
the
location
can
be
null
in
the
former
case
the
converter
should
ensure
that
the
size
of
the
destination
area
is
large
enough
to
handle
the
converted
value
if
the
destination
area
is
not
large
enough
then
the
converter
should
set
the
size
to
the
amount
of
space
needed
and
return
false
the
caller
can
then
ensure
that
enough
space
is
allocated
and
reinvoke
the
converter
if
the
size
is
large
enough
then
the
converter
can
simply
copy
the
converted
value
into
the
space
given
and
return
true
if
the
location
is
null
then
the
converter
can
assign
the
location
to
the
address
of
a
static
variable
containing
the
converted
value
and
return
true
when
writing
a
group
of
converters
this
code
is
often
repeated
and
it
becomes
convenient
to
define
a
macro
define

inside
the
converter
it
is
a
good
idea
to
perform
a
little
safety
checking
on
the
numargs
and
args
arguments
to
ensure
that
your
converter
is
being
called
properly
once
you
have
written
your
converter
you
need
to
register
it
with
the
intrinsics
the
intrinsics
invokes
resource
converters
when
creating
widgets
and
fetching
their
resource
values
from
the
resource
database
to
register
a
converter
with
a
single
application
context

in

there
were
the

xtappaddconverter
and
xtaddconverter
these
have
been
superseded
by
xtappsettypeconverter
and
xtsettypeconverter
whenever
possible
the
newer
routines
should
be
used
when
a
converter
is
registered
with
the
intrinsics
a
cache
argument
specifies
how
converted
resource
values
are
to
be
cached
xtcachenone
dont
cache
any
converted
values
xtcacheall
cache
all
converted

xtcachebydisplay
cache
converted
values
on
a

basis
caching
converted
values
that
require
a
roundtrip
to
the
server
is
a
good
idea
for
instance
string
to
pixel
conversions
the
destructor
argument
is
a
routine
that
is
invoked
then
the
resource
is
destroyed
either
because
its
cached
reference
count
has
been
decremented
to
zero
or
because
the
widget
owning
the
value
is
being
destroyed
xtdestructor

the

is
invoked
to

auxiliary
storage
associated
with
the
to
argument
but
does
not
actually
free
the
storage
pointed
to
by
the
to
argument
itself
toaddr
the
destructor
is
passed
the
extra
arguments
that
were
passed
to
the
converter
when
the
conversion
was
performed
for
instance
colormap
and
visual
arguments
for
the
string
to
pixel
converter
since
the
destructor
would
need
to
free
the
allocated
pixel
from
the
colormap
as
well
as
the
private
data
passed
in
when
the
converter
was
registered

the

issue
summer
by
oliver
jones
for
a
complete
coverage
of
the
issues
involved
most
of
this
answer
is
based
on
that
article
in
a
nutshell
one
uses
xtopendisplay
to
add
each
display
to
a
single
application
context
and
then
xtclosedisplay
to
shutdown
each
display
and
remove
it
from
the
application
context
the
real
problems
occur
when
trying
to
close
down
a
display
this
can
happen
ways
user
selects
a
quit
button
on
one
of
the
displays
user
has
window
manager
send
a
wmdeletewindow
message
server
disconnect
possibly
from
a
killclient
message
server
shutdowncrash
or
network
failure
ill
assume
you
can
deal
gracefully
with
since
it
is
merely
a
problem
of
translating
a
widget
to
a
display
and
removing
that
display
if
not
then
read
the
oliver
jones
article
the
third
one
is
difficult
to
handle
the
following
is
based
on
the
oliver
jones
article
and
i
include
it
here
because
it
is
a
difficult
problem
the
difficulty
arises
because
the
xlib
design
presumed
that
an
io
error
is
always
unrecoverable
and
so
fatal
this
is
essentially
true
for
a
single
display
x
based
application
but
not
true
for
a
multiple
display
program
or
an
application
that
does
things
other
than
display
information
on
an
x
server
when
an
x
io
error
occurs
the
io
error
handler
is
called
and
if
it
returns
then
an
exit
happens
the
only
way
around
this
is
to
use
setjmplongjmp
to
avoid
returning
to
the
io
error
handler
the
following
code
fragment
demonstrates
this
include
setjmph
jmpbuf
xiorecover
void
xiohandler
dpy
display
dpy
destroydisplay
dpy
longjmp
xiorecover
main
if
setjmp
xiorecover
xsetioerrorhandler
xiohandler
xtappmainloop
appcontext
the
destroydisplay
is
something
that
given
a
display
pointer
can
go
back
to
the
application
specific
data
and
perform
any
necessary
cleanup
it
should
also
call
xtclosedisplay
for
those
of
you
unfamiliar
with
setjmplongjmp
when
setjmp
is
first
called
it
returns
a
and
saves
enough
information
in
the
jmpbuf
that
a
latter
execution
of
longjmp
can
return
the
program
to
the
same
state
as
if
the
setjmp
was
just
executed
the
return
value
of
this
second
setjmp
is
the
value
of
the
second
argument
to
longjmp
there
are
several
caveats
about
using
these
but
for
this
purpose
it
is
adequate
some
other
problems
you
might
run
into
are
resource
converters
that
improperly
cache
resources
the
most
likely
symptoms
are
xlib
errors
such
as
badcolor
badatom
or
badfont
there
may
be
problems
with
the
total
number
of
displays
you
can
open
since
typically
only
a
limited
number
of
file
descriptors
are
available
with
being
a
typical
value
you
may
also
run
into
authorization
problems
when
trying
to
connect
to
a
display
there
was
much
discussion
in
compwindowsx
about
this
topic
in
november
of
robert
scheifler
posted
an
article
which
basically
said
this
is
the
way
it
will
be
and
xlib
will
not
change
what
changed

this

only

the

thanks

ojpictelcom
for
the
following
you
can
use
several
environment
variables
to
control
how
resources
are
loaded
for
your
xtbased
programs
xfilesearchpath
xuserfilesearchpath
and
xapplresdir
these
environment
variables
control
where
xt
looks
for
applicationdefaults
files
as
an
application
is
initializing
xt
loads
at
most
one
appdefaults
file
from
the
path
defined
in
xfilesearchpath
and
another
from
the
path
defined
in
xuserfilesearchpath
set
xfilesearchpath
if
software
is
installed
on
your
system
in
such
a
way
that
appdefaults
files
appear
in
several
different
directory
hierarchies
suppose
for
example
that
you
are
running
suns
open
windows
and
you
also
have
some
x
applications
installed
in
you
could
set
a
value
like
this
for
xfilesearchpath
and
it
would
cause
xt
to
look
up
appdefaults
files
in
both
and
usropenwinlib
or
wherever
your
openwinhome
is
located
setenv
xfilesearchpath
the
value
of
this
environment
variable
is
a
colonseparated
list
of
pathnames
the
pathnames
contain
replacement
characters
as
follows
see
xtresolvepathname
n
the
value
of
the
filename
parameter
or
the
applications
class
name
t
the
value
of
the

type
in
this
case

t
the
territory
part
of
the
displays
language
string
c
the
codeset
part
of
the
displays
language
string
lets
take
apart
the
example
suppose
the
applications
class
name
is
myterm
also
suppose
open
windows
is
installed
in
usropenwin
notice
the
example
omits
localespecific
lookup
means
openwinhomelibtn
means
usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm
as
the
application
initializes
xt
tries
to
open
both
of
the
above
appdefaults
files
in
the
order
shown
as
soon
as
it
finds
one
it
reads
it
and
uses
it
and
stops
looking
for
others
the
effect
of
this
path
is
to
search
first
in
then
in
usropenwin
lets
consider
another
example
this
time
lets
set
xuserfilesearchpath
so
it
looks
for
the
file
mytermad
in
the
current
working
directory
then
for
myterm
in
the
directory
appdefaults
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
nadhomeappdefaultsn
the
first
path
in
the
list
expands
to
mytermad
the
second
expands
to
homeappdefaultsmyterm
this
is
a
convenient
setting
for
debugging
because
it
follows
the
imake
convention
of
naming
the
appdefaults
file
mytermad
in
the
applications
source
directory
so
you
can
run
the
application
from
the
directory
in
which
you
are
working
and
still
have
the
resources
loaded
properly
note
when
looking
for
appdefault
files
with
xuserfilesearchpath
for
some
bizarre
reason
neither
the
type
nor
file
suffix
is
defined
so
t
and
s
are
useless
with
theres
another
twist
you
may
specify
a
customization
resource
value
for
example
you
might
run
the
myterm
application
like
this
myterm
xrm
customization
color
if
one
of
your
pathname
specifications
had
the
value
then
the
expanded
pathname
would
be
because
the
c
substitution
character
takes
on
the
value
of
the
customization
resource
the
default
xfilesearchpath
compiled
into
xt
is
note
some
sites
replace
with
a
projectroot
in
this
batch
of
default
settings
the
default
xuserfilesearchpath
also
compiled
into
xt
is
rootlnc
rootlnc
rootnc
rootln
rootln
rootn
root
is
either
the
value
of
xapplresdir
or
the
users
home
directory
if
xapplresdir
is
not
set
if
you
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
some
value
other
than
the
default
xt
ignores
xapplresdir
altogether
notice
that
the
quick
and
dirty
way
of
making
your
application
find
your
appdefaults
file
in
your
current
working
directory
is
to
set
xapplresdir
to
a
single
dot
in
all
this
machinery
worked
differently
for
compatibilty
many
people
set
their
xapplresdir
value
to
a
dot
followed
by
a
slash
what
order
are
callbacks
executed
in
courtesy
of
donna
converse
converseexpolcsmitedu
the
intrinsics
library
do
not
guarantee
an
order
this
is
because
both
the
widget
writer
and
the
application
writer
have
the
ability
to
modify
the
entire
contents
of
the
callback
list
neither
one
currently
knows
what
the
other
is
doing
and
so
the
intrinsics
cannot
guarantee
the
order
of
execution
the
application
programmer
cannot
rely
on
the
widget
writer
the
widget
writer
is
not
required
to
document
when
the
widget
will
add
and
remove
callbacks
from
the
list
or
what
effect
this
will
have
therefore
the
functionality
contained
in
a
callback
should
be
independent
of
the
functionality
contained
in
other
callbacks
on
the
list
even
though
the
xt
standard
in
the
definition
of
xtaddcallback
says
callbackname
specifies
the
callback
list
to
which
the
procedure
is
to
be
appended
you
may
not
infer
from
the
word
appended
that
the
callback
routines
are
called
in
the
same
order
as
they
have
been
added
to
the
callback
list
how
do
i
know
if
a
widget
is
visible
courtesy
of
donna
converse
converseexpolcsmitedu
i
am
building
a
widget
needs
to
know
if
it
is
visible
i
set
the
visible
interest
field
in
core
and
if
my
window
is
completely
obscured
the
core
visible
flag
goes
false
however
if
my
window
is
iconified
the
flag
stays
set
to
true
right
everything
is
implemented
correctly
this
demonstrates
a
deficiency
in
the
x
protocol
and
the
core
widget
is
reflecting
the
capabilities
of
the
protocol
the
deficiency
is
that
the
information
is
available
in
one
way
in
this
case
an
inconvenient
way
the
xt
specification
is
accurate
in
the
second
and
third
paragraphs
of
section
so
read
this
section
carefully
the
visible
field
will
not
change
in
response
to
iconification
a
visibilitynotify
event
will
not
be
received
when
the
window
goes
from
viewable
to
unviewable
that
is
when
the
widget
or
an
ancestor
is
unmapped
that
is
when
iconification
occurs
this
is
the
protocol
deficiency
visibility
state
and
viewable
state
have
specific
meanings
in
the
x
protocol
see
the
glossary
in
your
xlib
and
x
protocol
reference
manual
is
this
a
problem
with
mwm
or
is
there
something
else
which
needs
to
be
done
youll
see
this
with
any
window
manager
with
no
window
manager
if
the
problem
is
mwm
what
is
the
fastest
way
to
determine
if
a
window
is
iconified
as
an
application
writer
keep
track
with
a
global
boolean
in
an
action
routine
with
translations
for
mapnotify
and
unmapnotify
on
the
shell
widget
which
contains
your
custom
widget
as
the
custom
widget
writer
see
the
mapstate
field
returned
by
a
call
to
xgetwindowattributes
these
are
suggestions
how
do
i
reparent
a
widget
in
xt
ie
xtreparentwidget
you
cant
why
use
xtmalloc
xtfree
etc
unfortunately
most
code
that
calls
malloc
realloc
or
calloc
tends
to
ignore
the
possibility
of
returning
null
at
best
it
is
handled
something
like
ptr
type
malloc
sizeof
type
if
ptr
perror
malloc
in
xyzzy
exit
to
handle
this
common
case
the
intrinsics
define
the
functions
xtmalloc
xtcalloc
xtnew
xtnewstring
and
xtrealloc
which
all
use
the
standard
c
language
functions
malloc
calloc
and
realloc
but
execute
xterrormsg
if
a
null
value
is
returned
xt
error
handlers
are
not
supposed
to
return
so
this
effectively
exits
in
addition
if
xtrealloc
is
called
with
a
null
pointer
it
uses
xtmalloc
to
get
the
initial
space
this
allows
code
like
if
ptr
ptr
type
malloc
sizeof
type
else
ptr
type
realloc
ptr
sizeof
type
count
count
to
be
written
as
ptr
xtrealloc
ptr
sizeof
ptr
count
also
xtfree
accepts
a
null
pointer
as
an
argument
generally
ive
found
the
xt
functions
conveniant
to
use
however
anytime
im
allocating
anything
potentially
large
i
use
the
standard
functions
so
i
can
fully
recover
from
not
enough
memory
errors
xtnew
and
xtnewstring
are
conveniant
macros
for
allocating
a
structure
or
copying
a
string
struct
abc
xyzzy
char
ptr
char
str
abcdef
xyzzy
xtnew
struct
abc
takes
care
of
type
casting
ptr
xtnewstring
str
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
intrinsics
reference
manual
allow
an
implementation
to
provide
functions
that
are
not
exchangable
with
malloc
and
free
ie
code
such
as
char
ptr
ptr
xtmalloc
free
ptr
may
not
work
personally
id
call
any
implementation
that
did
this
broken
and
complain
to
the
vendor
a
common
error
for
motif
programmers
is
to
use
xtfree
on
a
string
when
they
should
really
be
using
xmstringfree
how
to
debug
an
xt
application
first
id
recomend
getting
purify
from
pure
software
this
is
a
great
package
for
tracing
memory
problems
on
suns
its
a
bit
pricey
at
but
id
still
recomend
it
excuse
the
marketing
blurb
contact
supportpurecom
for
more
info
purify
inserts
additional
checking
instructions
directly
into
the
object
code
produced
by
existing
compilers
these
instructions
check
every
memory
read
and
write
performed
by
the
program
under
test
and
detect
several
types
of
access
errors
such
as
reading
unitialized
memory
writing
past
mallocd
bounds
or
writing
to
freed
memory
purify
inserts
checking
logic
into
all
of
the
code
in
a
program
including
third
party
and
vendor
objectcode
libraries
and
verifies
system
call
interfaces
in
addition
purify
tracks
memory
usage
and
identifies
individual
memory
leaks
using
a
novel
adaption
of
garbage
collection
techniques
purifys
nearly
comprehensive
memory
access
checking
slows
the
target
program
down
typically
by
a
factor
of
two
to
five
an
alternative
package
that
isnt
as
pricey
for
a
sun
runs
on
many
unixs
and
has
pretty
similar
features
is
the
sentinel
debugging
environment
this
replaces
malloc
and
several
other
c
library
functions
to
add
additional
checks

next
if
you
are
getting
any
sort
of
xlib
error
youll
need
to
run
in
synchronous
mode
easily
accomplished
with
the
sync
command
line
argument
or
by
setting
the
variable
xdebug
to
with
your
debugger
then
set
a
break
point
in
exit
this
will
let
you
trace
back
to
the
original
xlib
function
being
called
if
you
dont
run
in
synchronous
mode
then
the
actual
error
may
have
occured
any
number
of
calls
to
xlib
previously
since
the
xlib
calls
are
buffered
and
replies
from
the
server
are
asynchronous
next
if
you
are
having
trouble
with
window
layout
you
can
use
the
undocumented
resource
xtidentifywindows
or
the
class
resource
xtdebug
to
cause
the
widget
name
to
be
identified
with
each
window
for
example
example
xload
xrm
xtdebugtrue
example
xwininfo
tree
click
in
new
xload
window
will
give
the
normal
information
but
the
widget
name
and
class
of
each
window
is
included
this
can
help
for
checking
the
location
and
size
of
errant
widgets
next
if
you
are
having
trouble
with
geometry
managers
or
you
want
to
test
the
way
a
widget
manages
its
children
you
can
try
exportlcsmiteducontriblibxtgeotarz
this
acts
as
a
filter
between
any
children
and
a
geometry
manager
and
checks
the
behaviour
of
both
its
a
very
clever
idea
the
most
unfortunate
problem
is
debugging
a
callback
while
the
application
is
executing
a
grab
of
the
keyboard
or
mouse
such
as
from
a
pulldown
menu
the
server
effectively
locks
up
and
youll
need
to
go
to
another
machine
and
kill
the
debugger
manually
the
server
locks
up
because
the
application
being
debugged
has
said
no
one
else
can
have
access
to
the
keyboard
but
the
application
is
not
stopped
waiting
because
the
debugger
is
waiting
for
your
commands
unfortunately
you
cant
give
them
because
all
the
input
is
going
to
your
application
which
is
stopped
the
best
way
to
debug
this
kind
of
problem
is
with
two
machines
on
your
desk
running
the
program
under
a
debugger
or
other
environment
on
one
machine
and
running
the
application
on
the
other
possibly
using
a
command
sequence
like
this
othermachine
xhost
thismachine
thismachine
setenv
display
thismachine
gdb
application
your
favorite
debugger
or
this

i
believe
codecenter
a
c
interpretergraphical
debugger
has
a
method
of
dealing
with
this
by
explicitely
calling
the
xlib
functions
to
release
any
grabs
during
breakpoints
debugging
widget
problems
requires
pretty
good
debugging
skills
and
knowledge
of
how
widgets
work
you
can
go
a
long
way
without
knowing
the
internals
of
a
particular
widget
but
not
very
far
without
understanding
how
a
widget
works
judicious
use
of
conditional
breakpoints
and
adding
print
statements
with
the
debugger
help
a
great
deal
why
dont
xtaddinput
xtaddtimeout
and
xtaddworkproc
work
i
have
got
a
delicate
problem
with
the
three
routines
xtaddinput
xtaddtimeout
and
xtaddworkproc
the
problem
i
have
is
that
when
i
use
them
in
my

they
seem
not
to
be
registred
properly
i
have
made
a
handy
little
testprogram
where
everything
works
perfect
but
in
my
real

nothing
happens
the
introduction
in
of
the
xtapp
functions
obsoleted
those
routines
see
for
other
changes
in
and
what
happens
is
they
use
a
default
application
context
different
then
the
one
you
may
have
created
since
events
and
timeouts
are
distributed
on
a
per
application
context
basis
and
you
are
using
two
application
contexts
you
wont
get
those
events
for
example
cnt
toplevel
xtappinitializeapp
class
desc
xtnumber
desc
argc

cnt
xtaddtimeout

strange

problem
hi
im

when
my

expose

namely
some

work
and
some
do
not
in

the
expose
consist
of
two
xfillrectangle

followed
by
some
xdrawpoint
calls
and
for
reasons
unknown
to
me
the
point
calls
are
failing
whenever
a

but
after

this

of
gif
files
or
pict
that
i
have
scanned
in
with
a

scanner
now
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
convert
the
gif
files
into
a
format
that
could
be
read
into
my
application
and
displayed
on
the
background
of
its
main
window
preferably
with
pixmaps
or
perhaps
as
an
ximage
i
have
found
functions
in
the
pbmplus
program
suite
to
convert
gif
to
xbm
but
that
is
monochrome
and
i
really
do
need
color
i
have
looked
at
xv
which
reads
in
gif
and
writes
out
several
formats
but
have
not
found
a
way
to
write
out
a
file
which
can
be
read
in
as
a
pixmap
is
there
an
easy
way
to
do
this

programming
interpreting

document

request
x
is
important

we
often
award
worst
abuse

rules

an

point

byte
size

also
abusing

format
tends

annoy

we
do
realize

there

holes

invite

award

abuse

hole

check

sometimes
make

the
effort

debug
an
entry

has
a
slight
problem

x
in

near
the
final
round

x

another

your

size
up

we
want
to
get

away

a

x
x
given
two
versions

one
that

a
compact
blob
x
of

the
other
that

more
like

we

favor
the

a

version

x
x
we

we

there

x
x
client

avoid

related

software
that

we

athena

talks
x
x
after
the
usenix
announcement
we
attempt
to
send
email
to
the
x
authors
of
the
winning
entries
one
reason
we
do
this
is
to
give
x
the
authors
a
chance
to
comment
on
the
way
we
have
presented
their
x
entry
they
are
given
the
chance
to
correct
mistakes
typos
we
x
often
accept
their
suggestionscomments
about
our
remarks
as
well
x
this
is
done
prior
to
posting
the
winners
to
the
wide
world
x
x
judging
consists
of
a
number
of
elimination
rounds
during
a
round
x
the
collection
of
entries
are
divided
into
two
roughly
equal
piles
x
the
pile
that
advances
on
to
the
next
round
and
the
pile
that
does
x
not
we
also
reexamine
the
entries
that
were
eliminated
in
the
x
previous
round
thus
an
entry
gets
at
least
two
readings
x
x
a
reading
consists
of
a
number
of
actions
x
x
reading
the
entry
section
x
reading
the
uudecoded
build
section
x
reading
the
uudecoded

section

x
x
until
we
reduce
the
stack
of
entries
down
to
about
entries
entries
x
are
judged
on
an
individual
basis
an
entry
is
set
aside
because
it
x
does
not
in
our
opinion
meet
the
standard
established
by
the
round
x
when
the
number
of
entries
thins
to
about
entries
we
begin
to
form
x
award
categories
entries
begin
to
compete
with
each
other
for
awards
x
an
entry
often
will
compete
in
several
categories
x
x
the
actual
award
category
list
will
vary
depending
on
the
types
of
entries
x
we
receive
a
typical
category
list

anything
else
so
strange
that
it
deserves

x
x
we
do
not
limit
ourselves
to
this
list
for
example
a
few
entries
are
so
x
goodbad
that
they
are
declared
winners
at
the
start
of
the
final
round
x
we
will
invent
awards
categories
for
them
if
necessary
x
x
in
the
final
round
process
we
perform
the
difficult
tasks
of
x
reducing
the
remaining
entries
typically
about
down
to
or
x
winners
often
we
are
confident
that
the
entries
that
make
it
into
x
the
final
round
are
definitely
better
than
the
ones
that
do
not
x
make
it
the
selection
of
the
winners
out
of
the
final
round
is
x
less
clear
cut
x
x
sometimes
a
final
round
entry
good
enough
to
win
but
is
beat
out
x
by
a
similar
but
slightly
better
entry
for
this
reason
it
is
x
sometimes
worthwhile
to
reenter
an
improved
version
of
an
entry
x
that
failed
to
win
in
a
previous
year
this
assumes
of
course
x
that
the
entry
is
worth
improving
in
the
first
place
x
x
more
often
that
not
we
select
a
small
entry
usually
one
line
a
x
strangecreative
layout
entry
and
an
entry
that
abuses
the
contest
x
rules
in
some
way
x
x
in
the
end
we
traditionally
pick
one
entry
as
best
sometimes
such
x
an
entry
simply
far
exceeds
any
of
the
other
entry
more
often
the
x
best
is
picked
because
it
does
well

i
might

need

to
display

i
noticed
the
xvertext
package
on
the
net
it
looks
very
good
but
it
has
one
slight
problem
the
api
to
it
assumes
you
have
a
font
name
not
an
already
loaded
font
it
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
to
split
up
the
function
into
two
interface
routines
one
with
a
font
name
and
one
with
an

i
thought
i
would
ask
the
author
alan
richardson
first
in
case
he
was
planning
this
already
unfortunately
his
email
address
bounced
does
alan

the

see
this
the

address
you
mentioned

is
for
use
with

you
know

do

motif
managers
take
a
very
simplistic
approach
to
the
way
they
handle
events
for
gadgets
they
track
for
all
eventssuch
as
motion
notify
wether
or
not
the
gadget
expresses
interest
in
the
events
as
a
result
gadgets
typically
generate
a
great
deal
more
network
traffic
those
with
x
terminals
might
find
a
noticable
network
performance
drop
as
a
result
really
whats
the
point
using
gadgets
then
it
is
a
case
of
memory
vs
network
performance
tradeoff
gadgets
save
both
client
and
server
memory
but
memory
is
easily
expandable
while
network
performance
is
not
so
if
i
were
designing
motif
i
would
at
least
make
it
possible
to
avoid
using
gadgets
at
present
you
really
dont
have
a
choice
because
motif
forces
you
to
use
gadgets
in
menus
and
in
various
other
places
adrian
nye
oreilly
and
associates
inc
ive
been
using
the
xmgraph
widget
thats
been
floating
around
and
i
noticed
the
performance
is
significantly
better
using
gadgets
perhaps
even
faster
i
had
heard
in
an
old
programming
course
that
gadgets
were
no
longer
any
benefit
to
performance
and
that
its
just
as
well
to
use
widgets
everywhere
so
why
would
pushbutton
gadgets
be
a
lot
quicker
than
pushbuttons
in
the
graph
should
i
start
putting
gadgets
back
into
my
long
pulldown
menus
xmgraph

shared
libraries
the
important
thing
to
do
is
to
follow
the
tips
given
in
the
gcc
release
gcc
generates
code
that
requires
and
you
should
take
that
into
account
when
deciding
which

to

for

they
arent

they
are
character
arrays
the
standard
strings
are
either
defined
as
string
constants
or
character
pointers
into
xtshellstrings
and
xtstrings
determined
by

your

were
compiled
with
this
defined
and
your

with

undefined
so
simply
recompile
one
or

it

in
my
opinion
a

is
still
worth
having
yes
but
a
cs
degree
is
not
a
programming
degree
does
anybody
know
of
a
computing
course
where
programming
is
taught
computer
science
is
a
branch
of
maths
or
the
course
i
did
was
ive
also
done
a
software
engineering
course
much
more
practical
and
likely
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employer
really
wants
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
at
robert
gordon
university
programming
was
the
main
most
timeconsuming
start
of
the
course
the
first
two
years
consisted
of
five
subjects
software
engineering
pascalcunix
computer
engineering
assembler
computer
theory
lispprolog
mathematicsstatistics
and
communication
skills
how
to
pass
interviewsintelligence
tests
and
group
discussions
eg
how
to
survive
a
helicopter
crash
in
the
north
sea
the
third
year
industrial
placement
was
spent
working
for
a
computer
company
for
a
year
the
company
could
be
anywhere
in
europe
there
was
a
special
travel
allowance
scheme
to
cover
the
visiting
costs
of
professors
the
fourth
year
included
operating
software
engineering
assembler
real
time
laboratory
assembler
and
computing
theory
lisp
there
were
also
group
projects
in
and
years
where
students
worked
in
teams
to
select
their
own
project
or
decide
to
work
for
an
outside
company
the
only
disadvantage
being
that
specifications
would
change
suddenly
in
the
first
four
years
there
was
a
weighting
between
courseworks
and
exams
for
most
subjects
however
in
the
honours
year
this
was
reduced
to
a
split
between
an
individual
project
and
final
exams
no
coursework
assessment
are
all
computer
science
courses
like
this
btw
we
started
off
with
students
in
our
first
year
and
were
left
with
by
honours
year
also
every
course
is
tutored
separately
not
easy

a
source
patch
for

with

libraries
was
developed
by
conrad
kimball
ceksdcboeingcom
it
retrofits
into
some
fixes
made

around
this
problem
the
patch

why
cant
gcc
compile
on
my
sparc
i
used
gcc
to
compile
the
whole
distribution
but
i
get
several
segmentation
faults
when
running
x
note
first
that
gcc
on
risc
machines
does
not
necessarily
result
in
any
performance
increase
it
certainly
is
not
as
noticeable
as
it
is
on
the
or
vax
platforms
here
is
the
problem
gcc
and
cc
use
incompatible
methods
of
passing
structures
as
arguments
and
returning
them
as
function
values
so
when
gcccompiled
parts
of
x
are
linked
with
sunsupplied
functions
that
pass
or
return
structs
runtime
errors
occur
affected
programs
include
rgb
and
the
server
this
is
from
the
gcc
manual
on
the
sparc
gnu
cc
uses
an
incompatible
calling
convention
for
structures
it
passes
them
by
including
their
contents
in
the
argument
list
whereas
the
standard
compiler
passes
them
effectively
by
reference
this
really
ought
to
be
fixed
but
such
calling
conventions
are
not
yet
supported
in
gnu
cc
so
it
isnt
straightforward
to
fix
it
the
convention
for
structure
returning
is
also
incompatible
and
fpccstructreturn
does
not
help
you
can
duck
the
problem
either
by
using
cc
throughout
or
by
using
it
for
just
the
routines
which
cause
incompatibilities
the
problem
cannot
be
solved
with
compilation
flags
files
which
need
to
be
compiled
using
cc
include
rgbrgbc
in
addition
several
of
the

the

will
only
run
on
a

which
supports
it

as
well
as
many

servers
do
not
support
the
shape

in
which
case
they
will
display
rectangular

anyway
in
order
to
use
the
shape

you
must
link

this

and
the
associated

will
be

do
not

many

programs
which
use
the

can
also
be
compiled
without

what
you

a
sideeffect

a
kludge
in

to
get
sun
shared
libraries
working
apparently
you
cant
share
a
function
that
is
both
called
and
compared
as
xtinherit
is
this
was
handled
by
putting
xtinherit
in
the
same
file
as
a
function
that
is
always
used
thereby
guaranteeing
that
it
would
be
loaded
that
is
in
initializec
where
xttoolkitinitialize
and
xtinitialize
reside
these
routines
would
normally
be
called
you
are
probably
seeing
this
error
because
your
program
is
not
a
normal
xtbased
program
and
does
not
call
xttoolkitinitialize

to

osfmotifs
uil
had
this
problem
it
called
xtmalloc
and
other
xt
functions
the
solution
is
to
add
the
call
to
your
program
the
function
does
not
have
to
be
executed
just
linked
in
alternatively
your
program
doesnt
need
any
xt
functions
and
is
correct
in
not
calling
xttoolkitinitialize
it
may
be
an
xlib
or
xview
program
in
this
case
you
can
remove
lxt
from

why

me
sic
the

interface
for
retrieving
resources

is
sensitive

may
be
doing

xtnsensitive
is
a

which
on
most

is
a
single
byte
declaring
the
variable
sensitive
as
boolean
works
properly
this
problem
comes
up
often
when
using
particular
toolkits
that
redefine
the
xt
types
dimension
and
position
code
that
assumes
they
are
int
will
have
similar
problems
if
those
types
are
actually
short
in
general
you
are
safe
if
you
use
the
actual

the

it
appears

man
page
subject
why
dont
xtconfigurewidgetxtresizewidgetxtmovewidget
work
youre
probably
trying
to
use
these
functions
from
application
code
they
should
be
used
only
internally
to
widgets
these
functions
are
for
a
parent
widget
to
change
the
geometry
of
its
children
other
promising
functions
xtmakegeometryrequest
and
xtmakeresizerequest
are
also
for
use
only
by
widgets
in
this
case
by
a
child
to
request
a
change
from
its
parent
the
only
way
for
your
application
to
request
a
geometry
change
for
a
widget
is
to
issue
an
xtsetvalues
call
setting
some
of
the
geometry
resources
although
this
will
result
in
the
widgetinternal
functions
being
called
your
application
code
must
use
the
standard
xtsetvalues
interface
or
risk
the
widgets
data
becoming
corrupted
the
xlib
calls
xmovewindow
and
xresizewindow
should
similarly
be
avoided
they
shouldnt
be
used
to
change
xtnx
xtny
xtnwidth
or
xtnheight
subject
why
isnt
there
an
xtreparentwidget
call
like
xreparentwindow
although
there
are
various
details
of
the
current
implementation
of
the
xt
internals
which
make
reparenting
difficult
the
major
reason
that
no
such
call
exists
is
that
it
remains
undefined
what
the
set
of
resources
for
the
new
widget
should
be
resources
are
typically
set
based
on
the
location
in
the
instance
hierarchy
what
resources
should
change
if
the
instance
moves
what
should
happen
to
the
widgets
children
and
by
the
time
such
semantics
are
defined
there
would
probably
be
little
advantage
over
destroying
the
old
widget
and
creating
a
new
widget
in
the
correct
location
with
the
desired
resources
as
setting
the
resources
correctly
is
the
majority
of
work
in
creating

to

make

you

use

use
xgetimage
to
grab
the

you
get
one

the

tell

the

way
for
an

it
necessary

the
easiest
thing
to
do
is
to
create
a
single

window
that
is
as
large
as
the
largest
possible
screen
make
it
a
child
of
your

it
will
be
clipped
to
that

so
it
wont
affect
any
other

it
needs
to
be
as
big
as
the
largest
possible
screen
in
case
the
user
enlarges
the
window
while
it
is
busy

moves
elsewhere
within
a

substitute

how
can
my

program
handle
socket
pipe
or
file
input
its
very
common
to
need
to
write
an
xt
program
that
can
accept
input
both
from
a
user
via
the
x
connection
and
from
some
other
file
descriptor
but
which
operates
efficiently
and
without
blocking
on
either
the
x
connection
or
the
other
file
descriptor
a
solution
is
use
xtappaddinput
after
you
open
your
file
descriptor
use
xtappaddinput
to
register
an
input
handler
the
input
handler
will
be
called
every
time
there
is
something
on
the
file
descriptor
requiring
your
programs
attention
write
the
input
handler
like
you
would
any
other
xt
callback
so
it
does
its
work
quickly
and
returns
it
is
important
to
use
only
nonblocking
io
system
calls
in
your
input
handlers
most
input
handlers
read
the
file
descriptor
although
you
can
have
an
input
handler
write
or
handle
exception
conditions
if
you
wish
be
careful
when
you
register
an
input
handler
to
read
from
a
disk
file
you
will
find
that
the
function
is
called
even
when
there
isnt
input
pending
xtappaddinput
is
actually
working
as
it
is
supposed
to
the
input
handler
is
called
whenever
the
file
descriptor
is
ready
to
be
read
not
only
when
there
is
new
data
to
be
read
a
disk
file
unlike
a
pipe
or
socket
is
almost
always
ready
to
be
read
however
if
only
because
you
can
spin
back
to
the
beginning
and
read
data
youve
read
before
the
result
is
that
your
function
will
almost
always
be
called
every
time
around
xtappmainloop
there
is
a
way
to
get
the
type
of
interaction
you
are
expecting

to
test
whether
there

how
do
i
create
a
transparent
window
a
completely
transparent
window
is
easy
to
get
use
an
inputonly
window
in
order
to
create
a
window
which
is
mostly
transparent
you
have
several
choices
the
shape
extension
first
released
with
offers
an
easy
way
to
make
nonrectangular
windows
so
you
can
set
the
shape
of
the
window
to
fit
the
areas
where
the
window
should
be
nontransparent
however
not
all
servers
support
the
extension
a
machinespecific
method
of
implementing
transparent
windows
for
particular
servers
is
to
use
an
overlay
plane
supported
by
the
hardware
note
that
there
is
no
x
notion
of
a
transparent
color
index
a
generally
portable
solution
is
to
use
a
large
number
of
tiny
windows
but
this
makes
operating
on
the
application
as
a
unit
difficult
a
final
answer
is
to
consider
whether
you
really
need
a
transparent
window
or
if
you
would
be
satisfied
with
being
able
to
overlay
your
application
window
with
information
if
so
you
can
draw
into
separate
bitplanes
in
colors
that
will
appear

why
doesnt
gxxor
produce
mathematicallycorrect
color
values
when
using
gxxor
you
may
expect
that
drawing
with
a
value
of
black
on
a
background
of
black
for
example
should
produce
white
however
the
drawing
operation
does
not
work
on
rgb
values
but
on
colormap
indices
the
color
that
the
resulting
colormap
index
actually
points
to
is
undefined
and
visually
random
unless
you
have
actually
filled
it
in
yourself
on
many
x
servers
black
and
white
often
or
programs
taking
advantage
of
this
mathematical
coincidence
will
break
if
you
want
to
be
combining
colors
with
gxxor
then
you
should
be
allocating
a
number
of
your
own
color
cells
and
filling
them
with
your
chosen
precomputed
values
if
you
want
to
use
gxxor
simply
to
switch
between
two
colors
then
you
can
take
the
shortcut
of
setting
the
background
color
in
the
gc
graphics
context
to
and
the
foreground
color
to
a
value
such
that
when
it
draws
over
red
say
the
result
is
blue
and
when
it
draws
over
blue
the
result
is
red
this
foreground
value
is
itself
the
xor
of
the

indices
of

of

i
want
to
check
whether
the

exists
before
doing
anything
with
it
because
x
is
asynchronous
there
isnt
a

that
the

would
still

the
time
that
you
got
the
id
and
the
time
you
sent
an
event
to
the

otherwise
manipulated
it
what
you
should
do
is
send
the
event
without
checking
but
install
an
error
handler
to
catch
any
badwindow
errors
which
would
indicate
that
the
window
no

exists
this
scheme
will
work

almost
any

the

you

a
simple
way
to
handle
this
and
which
solves
the
problem
of
the
applications
running

is
in
the
first
application
to
create
a
speciallynamed
property
on

rootwindow
and
put
the
window
id
into
it
the
second
application
then
retrieves
the
property
whose
name
it
also
knows
and
then
can
draw
whatever
it
wants
into
the
window
note
this
scheme
works
iff
there
is
only
one
instance
of
the

application
running

the
scheme
is
subject
to
the
limitations
mentioned

note
also

cooperation

note
also
that
two
processes
can
share
a
window
but
should
not
try
to
use
the

connection
if
one
process
is

i
know
it
sounds
stupid

ik
does
anyone
know
how
to
control
individual
mouse
buttons
ik
i
am
writing
an

which
currently
makes
use
of
ik
buttonpressmask
however
this
is
invoked
by
the
pressing
ik
of
any
mouse
button
i
want
to
be
able
to
restrict
this
ik
to
one
of
the
buttons
i
tried
but
ik
just
get
undefined
errors
i
know
it
can
be
done
and
i
ik
am
pretty
sure
theres
an
easy
answer
to
it
but
i
just
dont
know
ik
what
it
is
ik
time
is
of
the
essence
there
is
no
event
mask
for
a
particular
mouse
button
press
however
in
your
event
handler
you
can
use
the
event
structure
passed
in

query
it
to
find
which

was

is
this
possible
games
such
as
xjewel
have
the
same
problem
how
does
the
mouse
pointer
do
it
any
help
would
be
helpful
you
wanna
do
masking
build
a
bitmap
pixmap
of
depth
one
where
all
pixels
you
name
opaque
are
that
get
copied
and
the
others
are
use
this
bitmap
as
the
clipmask
in
the
gc
used
for
xcopyarea
and
remember
to
adjust
the
cliporigin
coordinates
to
the
xcopyarea
blit
origin
the
mouse
pointer
besides
from
that
it
is
driven
using
ramdac
analog
mapping
on
most
hardwares
uses
a
mask
too
but
be
warned
blitting
through
a
mask
and
especially
moving
around
this
mask
is
annoying
slow
on
most
xservers
it
flickers

this
is
a
simple
x
graphics
question
assume
you
have
a
valid
window
w
an
icon
pixmap
and
the
background
mask
also
a
pixmap
for
that
icon
you
wish
to
place
the
icon
at
xy
in
w
without
the
background
question
what
combination
of
xcopyarea
and
gc
functions
are
necessary
i
think
the
idea
is
to
merge
only
those
pixels
of
pixmap
into
w
as
indicated
by
the
corresponding
mask
pixel
value
specifically
the
problem
involves
a
pixmap
and
mask
generated
by
the
xpm
libs
any
clues
would
be
most
appreciated
xpm
provides
you
with
symbolic
color
names
which
can
be
specified
at
load
time
so
for
doing
what
you
want
i
would
suggest
you
to
define
a
background
symbol
in
your
pixmap
file
which
youll
set
to
whatever
color
is
used
by
the
widget
or
the
window
on
which
you
want
to
put
your
pixmap
this
would
surely
be
the
simplest
and
fastest
way
to
do
what
you
want
no
as
soon
as
you
blit
two
of
this
icons
once
on
top
of
the
other
with
a
little
dislocation
you
see
the
rectangular
blit
crashes
too
much
of
the
icon
first
blitted
because
it
draws
a
full
rectangle
the
way
to
do
it
is
masking
create
a
bitmap
with
all
pixels
to
be
merged
are
and
all
not
to
be
merged
are
then
set
the
clipmask
of
the
gc
to
this
bitmap
set
the
clipxorigin
and
clipyorigin
of
the
gc
to
the
xy
coordinates
where
you
blit
the
icon
to
the
destination
drawable
use
gxcopy
and
xcopyarea
the
icon
pixmap
to
the
destination
drawable
using
this

acting
as
close
observers

is
produced
it
may
be
submitted
for
formal
technical
review
by

what
is
lowbandwidth
x
lbx
xremote
ppp
slip
cslip
there
are
several
options
for
using
x
over
serial
lines
slip
serial
line
ip
this
is
both
a
mechanism
and
a
protocol
for
sending
ip
packets
over
pointtopoint
serial
links
it
has
been
around
for
several
years
and
implementations
are
available
for
many
of
the
major
tcpip
implementations
most
x
terminal
vendors
supply
this
as
a
checkoff
item
although
nobody
really
ever
uses
it
since
it
is
horribly
slow
the
tcpip
headers
add
bytes
per
packet
and
the
tcpip
encoding
of
the
x
protocol
is
rather
verbose
rightfully
so
it
is
optimized
for
packing
and
unpacking
over
highspeed
links
cslip
compressed
header
slip
this
is
a
variant
of
slip
that
compresses
the
bytes
of
tcpip
headers
down
to
about
or
bytes
it
still
doesnt
do
anything
about
reencoding
the
x
protocol
modems
that
do
compression
can
help
but
they
increase
packet
latency
it
takes
time
to
dribble
the
uncompressed
data
through
typical
serial
interfaces
plus
the
compression
assembly
time
ppp
pointtopoint
protocol
this
is
an
emerging
standard
for
pointtopoint
links
over
serial
lines
that
has
a
more
complete
set
of
option
negotiation
than
slip
a
growing
number
of
people
see
the
combination
of
ppp
for
the
serial
line
management
and
cslip
for
the
header
compression
as
becoming
common
for
running
normal
tcpip
protocols
over
serial
lines
running
raw
x
over
the
wire
still
needs
compression
somewhere
to
make
it
usable
xremote
this
is
the
name
of
both
a
protocol
and
set
of
products
originally
developed
by
ncd
for
squeezing
the
x
protocol
over
serial
lines
in
addition
to
using
a
low
level
transport
mechanism
similar
to
pppcslip
xremote
removes
redundancies
in
the
x
protocol
by
sending
deltas
against
previous
packets
and
using
lzw
to
compress
the
entire
data
stream
this
work
is
done
by
either
a
pseudox
server
or
proxy
running
on
the
host
or
in
a
terminal
server
there
are
several
advantages
to
doing
compression
outside
the
modem
you
dont
have
to
have
compressing
modems
in
there
if
you
wouldnt
otherwise
be
using
them
eg
if
you
were
going
to
be
directly
connected
and
it
reduces
the
io
overhead
by
cutting
down
on
the
number
of
bytes
that
have
to
cross
the
serial
interface
and
in
addition
to
the
effects
of
it
reduces
the
latency
in
delivering
packets
by
not
requiring
the
modem
to
buffer
up
the
data
waiting
for
blocks
to
compress

and
xerox
and
is
using
ncds
xremote
protocol
as
a
stepping
stone
in
developing
the

lbx
will
go
beyond
xremote
by
adding
proxy
caching
of

information
eg
connection
setup
data
large
window
properties
font

how
can
i
change
the
titlebar
of
my
xterm
window
the
solution
involves
sending
an
escape
sequence
to
xterm
which
will
cause
it
to
update
the
property
which
the
window
manager
relies
upon
for
the
string
which
appears
in
the
window
titlebar
a
solution
is
as
easy
as
typing
this
in
an
xterm
running
a
shell
echo
where
esc
is
the
escape
key
text
is
the
string
you
wish
to
have
displayed
and
g
is
a
controlg
the
bel
character
here
is
a
more
complicated
csh
alias
which
changes
the
titlebar
to
the
current
working
directory
when
you
change
directories
alias
newcd
cd
echo
n
the
digit
in
these
strings
indicates
to
xterm
that
it
should
change
only
the
title
of
the
window
to
change
both
the
title
and
the
name
used
in
the
icon
use
the
digit
instead
and
use
to
change
only
the
icon
name

why
are
my
xterm
menus
so
small
you
are
probably
setting
the
geometry
small
accidentally
if
you
give
a
resource
specification
like
this
xtermgeometry
then
you
are
asking
for
all
widgets
under
xterm
to
have
their
geometry
set
to
for
the
main

this
is
ok
as
it
uses
characters
for
its
size

its

dont
they
are

how
can
i
print

you

however
a

hesketh
specifically

the

will
help

xselection
primary
lpr
finds
the
primary
selection
and
prints
it
this
command
can
be
placed
in
a

xselection
also

how
does
xt
use
environment
variables
in
loading
resources
you
can
use
several
environment
variables
to
control
how
resources
are
loaded
for
your
xtbased
programs
xfilesearchpath
xuserfilesearchpath
and
xapplresdir
these
environment
variables
control
where
xt
looks
for
applicationdefaults
files
as
an
application
is
initializing
xt
loads
at
most
one
appdefaults
file
from
the
path
defined
in
xfilesearchpath
and
another
from
the
path
defined
in
xuserfilesearchpath
set
xfilesearchpath
if
software
is
installed
on
your
system
in
such
a
way
that
appdefaults
files
appear
in
several
different
directory
hierarchies
suppose
for
example
that
you
are
running
suns
open
windows
and
you
also
have
some
x
applications
installed
in
you
could
set
a
value
like
this
for
xfilesearchpath
and
it
would
cause
xt
to
look
up
appdefaults
files
in
both
and
usropenwinlib
or
wherever
your
openwinhome
is
located
setenv
xfilesearchpath
the
value
of
this
environment
variable
is
a
colonseparated
list
of
pathnames
the
pathnames
contain
replacement
characters
as
follows
see
xtresolvepathname
n
the
value
of
the
filename
parameter
or
the
applications
class
name
t
the
value
of
the
file
type
in
this
case
the
literal
string
appdefaults
c
customization
resource
only
s
suffix
none
for

l
language
locale
and

eg
jajpeuc
l

part

eg
ja
t
the
territory
part
of
the
displays
language
string
c
the
codeset
part
of
the
displays
language
string
lets
take
apart
the
example
suppose
the
applications
class
name
is
myterm
also
suppose
open
windows
is
installed
in
usropenwin
notice
the
example
omits
localespecific
lookup
means
openwinhomelibtn
means
usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm
as
the
application
initializes
xt
tries
to
open
both
of
the
above
appdefaults
files
in
the
order
shown
as
soon
as
it
finds
one
it
reads
it
and
uses
it
and
stops
looking
for
others
the
effect
of
this
path
is
to
search
first
in
then
in
usropenwin
lets
consider
another
example
this
time
lets
set
xuserfilesearchpath
so
it
looks
for
the
file
mytermad
in
the
current
working
directory
then
for
myterm
in
the
directory
appdefaults
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
nadhomeappdefaultsn
the
first
path
in
the
list
expands
to
mytermad
the
second
expands
to
homeappdefaultsmyterm
this
is
a
convenient
setting
for
debugging
because
it
follows
the
imake
convention
of
naming
the
appdefaults
file
mytermad
in
the
applications
source
directory
so
you
can
run
the
application
from
the
directory
in
which
you
are
working
and
still
have
the
resources
loaded
properly
note
when
looking
for
appdefault
files
with
xuserfilesearchpath
for
some
bizarre
reason
neither
the
type
nor
file
suffix
is
defined
so
t
and
s
are
useless
with
theres
another
twist
you
may
specify
a
customization
resource
value
for
example
you
might
run
the
myterm
application
like
this
myterm
xrm
customization
color
if
one
of
your
pathname
specifications
had
the
value
then
the
expanded
pathname
would
be
because
the
c
substitution
character
takes
on
the
value
of
the
customization
resource
the
default
xfilesearchpath
compiled
into
xt
is
note
some
sites
replace
with
a
projectroot
in
this
batch
of
default
settings
the
default
xuserfilesearchpath
also
compiled
into
xt
is
rootlnc
rootlnc
rootnc
rootln
rootln
rootn
root
is
either
the
value
of
xapplresdir
or
the
users
home
directory
if
xapplresdir
is
not
set
if
you
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
some
value
other
than
the
default
xt
ignores
xapplresdir
altogether
notice
that
the
quick
and
dirty
way
of
making
your
application
find
your
appdefaults
file
in
your
current
working
directory
is
to
set
xapplresdir
to
a
single
dot
in
all
this
machinery
worked
differently
for
compatibilty
many
people
set
their
xapplresdir
value
to
a
dot
followed
by
a
slash

how
do
i
keep
my
display
when
i
rlogin
to
another

there
are
several
ways
to
avoid
having
to
do
a
setenv
display
whenever
you
log
in
to
another
networked
unix
machine
running
x
one
solution
is
to
use
the

on
the
contrib

it
includes
xrsh
a
script
to
start
an
x
application
on
remote

rlogin

is
on

in
one
solution
is
to
use
the
xrlogin
program
from
der
mouse
mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu
you
can
ftp
caveatemptor
versions
from
in
xxrloginc
and
xxrlogindc
the
program
packages
up
term
and
display
into
a
single
string
which
is
stuffed
into
term
rlogin
then
propagates
term
normally
your
cshrc
on
the
remote
machine
should
contain
eval
xrlogind
where
xrlogind
is
a
program
that
checks
term
and
if
it
is
of
the
special
format
it
recognizes
unpacks
it
and
spits
out
setenv
and
unsetenv
commands
to
recreate
the
environment
variables
in
addition
if
all
you
need
to
do
is
start
a
remote
x
process
on
another
host
and
you
find
rsh
host
n
display
display
too
simple
display
must
have
your

then
this
version
of

can
be
used
to

usage
would

neither

hi
i
am
trying
to
implement
a
pointer
feature
in
xlib
i
have
multiple
windows
and
all
can
take
input
and
show
output
simultaneously
on
all
other
displays
i
want
to
implement
a
pointer
feature
i
would
like
to
get
the
pointer
to
come
up
on
all
windows
once
i
choose
pointer
in
the
menu
and
every
one
should
be
able
to
see
it
can
you
give
me
some
hints
as
to
how
i
should
proceed
i
am

working
im
not

any
luck
with
either
the
xtici

from

or
with
oreillys
ftpable
example
xcms
from
ftpuunet
the
oreilly
example
fails
for
almost
every
set
of
inputs
because
xcmstekhvcquerymaxv
returns
a
smaller
value
than
xcmstekhvcqueryminv
does
which
makes
no
sense
to
me
the
xtici
editor
fails
in
xcmsstorecolors
apparently
because
the
mathematical
manipulations
of
the
color
specs
results
in
invalid
values
so
you
cant
actually
edit
any
colors
we
have
patch

pseudocolor
visual
ive
poked
around
in
the
xcms
code
in
xlib
but
without
some
understanding
of
the

i
have
no
idea
whats
going
wrong
can
somebody
confirm
if
either
of
the
abovementioned
programs
work
on

let

newsgroup
patches
themselves
are
available
via
ftp
from

and
from
other

from

they
are

also

compsourcesx
some

resellers
may

distributions
of
people
without

access
can
use
the
xstuff
mail
server
it
now
has
patches
for
send
to
xstuffexpolcsmitedu
the
subject
line
send
fixes
where
is
the
name
of
the
patch
and
is
usually
just
the
number
of
the
patch
here
are
a
few
complications
fix
is
in
four
parts
you
need
to
request
and
separately
the
file
sungxuu
which
was
part
of
an
earlier
patch
was
rereleased
with
patch
note
the
file
doesnt
work
with
solaris
fix
is
in
two
parts
and
fix
is
in
three
parts
and
fix
is
in
two
parts
and
fix
replaces
the
for
the
x
test
suite
which
previously
was
optional
fix
also
needs
pexlibtarz
which
you
can
obtain
from
xstuff
by
asking
for
fix
is
in
parts
through
subject
what
is
the
xstuff
mailarchive
the
xstuff
server
is
a
mailresponse
program
that
means
that
you
mail
it
a
request
and
it
mails
back
the
response
any
of
the
four
possible
commands
must
be
the
first
word
on
a
line
the
xstuff
server
reads
your
entire
message
before
it
does
anything
so
you
can
have
several
different
commands
in
a
single
message
unless
you
ask
for
help
the
xstuff
server
treats
the
subject
header
line
just
like
any
other
line
of
the
message
the
archives
are
organized
into
a
series
of
directories
and
subdirectories
each
directory
has
an
index
and
each
subdirectory
has
an
index
the
toplevel
index
gives
you
an
overview
of
what
is
in
the
subdirectories
and
the
index
for
each
subdirectory
tells
you
what
is
in
it
the
command
help
or
send
help
causes
the
server
to
send
you
a
more
detailed
version
of
this
help
file
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
index
then
the
server
will
send
you
the
toplevel
index
of
the
contents
of
the
archive
if
there
are
other
words
on
that
line
that
match
the
name
of
subdirectories
then
the
indexes
for
those
subdirectories
are
sent
instead
of
the
toplevel
index
for
example
you
can
say
send
index
fixes
or
index
fixes
a
message
that
requests
an
index
cannot
request
data
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
send
then
the
xstuff
server
will
send
you
the
items
named
on
the
rest
of
the
line
to
name
an
item
you
give
its
directory
and
its
name
for
example
send
fixes
you
may
issue
multiple
send
requests
the
xstuff
server
contains
many
safeguards
to
ensure
that
it
is
not
monopolized
by
people
asking
for
large
amounts
of
data
the
mailer
is
set
up
so
that
it
will
send
no
more
than
a
fixed
amount
of
data
each
day
if
the
work
queue
contains
more
requests
than
the
days
quota
then
the
unsent
files
will
not
be
processed
until
the
next
day
whenever
the
mailer
is
run
to
send
its
days
quota
it
sends
the
requests
out
shortestfirst
some
mailers
produce
mail
headers
that
are
unusable
for
extracting
return
addresses
if
you
use
such
a
mailer
you
wont
get
any
response
if
you
happen
to
know
an
explicit
path
you
can
include
a
line
like
path
foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu
or
path
barfoofrotz
in
the
body
of
your
message
and
the

re
honors
degrees
do
they
mean
anything
tkldcogsciedacuk
kevin
davidson
writes
in
my
opinion
a
programming
degree
is
still
worth
having
yes
but
a
cs
degree
is
not
a
programming
degree
does
anybody
know
of
a
computing
course
where
programming
is
taught
computer
science
is
a
branch
of
maths
or
the
course
i
did
was
ive
also
done
a
software
engineering
course
much
more
practical
and
likely
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employer
really
wants
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
try
the
msc
computing
science
course
at
the
real
newcastle
university
its
a
conversion
course
but
at
least
they
teach
real
programming
in
the
space
of
months
we
were
taught
pascal
simula
prolog
miranda
also
some
basic
low
level
stuff
was
covered
as
well
they
also
did
concurrent
programming
and
operating
systems
some
software
engineering
plus
quite
a
few
optional
units
including
database
theory
and
some
stuff
about
comms
the
pascal
is
to
be
replaced
by
cc
i
think
next
year
i
learnt
this
and
x
windows
programming
as
well
anyway
via
a
good
selection
of
project
over
the
final
three
months
depending
on
your
tastes
the
selection
of
skills
learnt
can
be
quite
wide
reaching
the
one
critiscism
i
would
level
at
the
course
which
i
would
have
thought
invaluable
is
the
lack
of
an
option
to
do
the
project
period
in
industry
this
would
probably
need
a
slightly
longer
project
period
say
six
months
but
would
enhance
the
prestige
and
usefulness
of
an
already
excellent
and
thorough
course
yes
i
know
this
sounds
like
a
plug
for
the
course
why
not

jan
xv
does
not
seem
to
be
able
to
override
whatever
vue
jan
puts
there
i
suspect
this
is
because
vue
creates
a
window
probably
overrideredirect
that
is
the
size
of
or
larger
than
the
root
window
because
the
window
manager
does
not
know
about
this
you
cannot
move

it
xv
in
the

time
is
busy
changing
your
root

to
whatever
you
have
requested
but
you
never
get
to
see
it
because
vues
window
is
overlaid
on
top
of
the
root

contact
hp
support
and
see
whether
vue
can
support
coloured
bitmap
format
such
as
xpm
if
they
cant
then
they
probably
create
all
their
coloured

theres

alluded

in

although
there
its
talking

you
need
to
force
libxmu
to
be
linked
statically
rather
than
dynamically
which
works
around
the

the

edit

i

heard
that
ford
motor
company
has
had
a
recruiting
bias
toward
engineers
and
away
from
computer
science
graduates
the
reasoning
is
supposedly
to
better
meet
long

this
is
evidenced
by
the
large
number
of
cs
people
who
are

are
not
brought
on

except
in
special
circumstances
this
is
a
generalization
which
obviously
doesnt
always
hold
true
but
there
are
statistics
furthermore
most
software
engineering
at
ford
gets
done
by
electrical
engineers
i
know
of
univerities
that
have
merged
the
computer
science
department
and
the
electrical
engineering
so
that
you
can
get
a
computer
degree
which
qualifies
you
for
much
more
than
programming
but
since
my
beliefs
and
opinions
are
merely
figments
of
my
distorted
imagination
i
suppose
i
should
keep
it
to
myself

to

the
case
you
can
take

out

probably
not

cool
you
can
wrap
your

solicts

longjmps

an

started

give
me
the
command
line
when
something
out
of
the
ordinary
needs
done
and
the
gooy
when
i
am
doing
normal
or
repative
work
note
that
most
operations
are
repetative
hackers
love
cls
because
what
i
like
about
guis
the
ability
to
view
and
manipulate
a
group
of
objects
files
text
directories
etc
and
and
manipulate
them
in
some
way
such
as
delete
copy
paste
rename

ability
to
have
several

screens
visible

accessable
at

being
able
to
do
a
standard
set
of
functions
easily
and
quickly
on
an
unfamiliar
operating

i
am
familiar
with
the
command
lines
of
several
operating
systems
but
occasionally
i
will
have
to
some
work
on
a
system
that
i
almost
never
use

it
has
a
gui
i
can
usually
accomplish
what
i
want
to
do
fairly
easily
the
command
line
on
the
other
hand
often
is
a
long
and
painful
experience
what
i
hate
about
guis
having
to
switch
between
the
mouse
and
the
keyboard
i
guess
i
have
a
strong
onehanded
preference
i
like
to
use
a
computer
with
one
hand
and
use
the
other
for
holding
something
like
a
piece
of
paper
of
a
mug
of
tea
i
have
configured
my
favorite
editor
so
that
most
of
the
editing
functions
can
be
done
with
one
hand
such
as
navigating
cutting
pasting
searching
opening
and
saving
files
etc
the
main
thing
i
need
to
use
both
hands
for
is
entering
text
i
guess
i
need
to
get
one
of
those
mice
with
like
buttons

something

then

let

try

i
run

something
recently
i
switched
to

their

that
are
somehow
translated
into
reverse
video
when
displayed
by

under

the
resulting
output
admittedly
a
personal
taste
is
very
annoying
to
look
at
back
when
i
was
using
sunos
i
remember
their
man
pages
have
some
keywords
displayed
with
underlining
so
my
question
is
how
do
i
change
the
xterms
behaviour
under
i
directives
for
nroff
man
pages
to
perhaps
underlining
or
at
least
disabling
it
b
directives
are
fine
i
like
them
and
of
course
i
dont
want
to
go
in
and
edit
the
man
pages
inputs
somehow
xterm
allows
one
to
specify
both
a
normal
font
and
a
bold
font
but
not
an
italic
font

pointers

ive
found
that
a
good

for
tiling
is
aka
it
is
the
biggest

i
know
of
that
i
can
use
on

still
get
two

make

a
proper
match
for

if
you
have

use
a

on
my

sun
i
havent
noticed
much
difference
between
the
xsun
colour
server
and
xsunmono
however
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
xsunmono
is
about
smaller
and
therefore
should
contribute
to
less
paging

how
your
server
was
compiled
can
also
make
a
difference
jeff
law
lawschirfcsutahedu
advises
us
that
on
a
sun
system
x
should
be
compiled
with
gcc
version
or
with
the
unbundled
sun
compiler
you
can
expect
to
get
very
large
speedups
in
the
server
by
not
using
the
bundled
sunos
compiler
i
assume
that
similar
results
would
occur
if
you
used
one
of
the
other
highquality
commercial
compilers
on
the
market
locking
the
server
into
ram
has
anyone
tried
hacking
the
x
server
so
that
it
is
locked
into
ram
and
does
not
get
paged
eg
via
a
call
to
plock
does
this
help
performance
at
all
ive
had
one
inquiry
on
this
topic
and
a
few
pointers
to
the
plock
function
call
but
no
hard
evidence
from
someone
whos
tried
it
i
am
not
in
a

to
give
it

starting
your
server
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
if
you
start
up
a
lot
of
clients
in
your
xsession
or
whatever
sleep
for
a
second
or
two
after
launching
each
one
after
i
changed
my
xclients
script
to
do
this
logging
in
actually
took
less
time
we
have
a
heavily
loaded
system
without
much
core
though
this
sounds
crazy
but
i
have
confirmed
that
it
works
warner
losh
impsolbournecom
provided
me
with
a
good
explanation
of
why
this
works
which
i
have
summarized
here
when
you
start
up
an
x
server
it
takes
a
huge
amount
of
time
to
start
accepting
connections
a
lot
of
initialization
is
done
by
the
server
when
it
starts
this
process
touches
a
large
number
of
pages
any
other
process
running
at
the
same
time
would
fight
the
server
for
use
of
the
cpu
and
more
importantly
memory
if
you
put
a
sleep
in
there
you
give
the
server
a
chance
to
get
itself
sorted
out
before
the
clients
start
up
similarly
there
is
also
a
lot
of
initialization
whenever
an
x
client
program
starts
toolkits
registering
widgets
resources
being
fetched
programs
initializing
state
and
databases
and
so
forth
all
this
activity
is
typically
memory
intensive
once
this
initialization
is
done
the
process
has
reached
a
steady
state
the
memory
usage
typically
settles
down
to
using
only
a
few
pages
by
using
sleeps
to
stagger
the
launching
of
your
clients
in
your
xinitrc
you
avoid
them
fighting
each
other
for
your
workstations
limited
resources
this
is
most
definitely
a
your
mileage
may
vary
situation
as
there
are
so
many
variables
to
be
considered
available
ram
local
swap
space
load
average
number
of
users
on
your
system
which
clients
you
are
starting
etc
currently
in
my
xinitrc
i
have
a
situation
like
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
experimented
with
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
even
tried
sleep
exec
startxclientsscript
and
then
in
startxclientsscript
i
had
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
the
idea
with
this
last
one
was
to
make
sure
that
xinit
had
completely
finished
processing
my
xinitrc
and
had
settled
down
into
a
steady
state
before
the
sleep
expired
and
all
my
clients
were
launched
all
of
these
yielded
fairly
comparable
results
and
so
i
just
stuck
with
my
current
setup
for
its
simplicity
you
will
probably
have
to
experiment
a
bit
to
find
a
setup
which
suits
you
fonts
loading
fonts
takes
time
and
ram
if
you
minimize
the
number
of
fonts
your
applications
use
youll
get
speed
increases
in
loadup
time
one
simple
strategy
is
to
choose
a
small
number
of
fonts
one
small
one
large
one
roman
whatever
suits
you
and
configure
all
your
clients
or
at
least
all
your
heavily
used
clients
to
use
only
those
few
fonts
client
programs
should
start
up
quicker
if
their
font
is
already
loaded
into
the
server
this
will
also
conserve
server
resources
since
fewer
fonts
will
be
loaded
by
the
server

my
main

up

its

etc
twms
default
font
is
since
i
dont
normally
use
ive
eliminated
one
font
from
my
server
oliver
jones
ojroadrunnerpictelcom
keep
fonts
local
to
the
workstation
rather
than
loading
them
over
nfs
if
you
will
make
extensive
use
of
scalable
fonts
use
a
font
server
about
the
resources
file
keep
your
xresources
xdefaults

small
saves
ram
and
saves

time
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
one
suggestion
in
your
xdefaults
xresources
file
try
putting
only
the
minimum
number
of
resources
that
you
want
to
have
available
to
all
of
your
applications
for
example
reversevideo
true
then
separate
your
resources
into
individual
clientspecific
resource
files
for
example
homelibappdefaults
in
your
login
file
set
the
environment
variable
xuserfilesearchpath
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
homelibappdefaultsn
the
compwindowsx
frequently
asked
questions
faq
contains
an
excellent
explanation
of
how
these
environment
variables
work
ed
so
when
xterm
launches
it
loads
its
resources
from
appdefaultsxterm
xdvi
finds
them
in
appdefaultsxdvi
and
so
on
and
so
forth
note
that
not
all
clients
follow
the
same
xxxxx
resourcefile
naming
pattern
you
can
check
in
your
system
appdefaults
directory
often
to
find
the
proper
name
and
then
name
your
personal
resource
files
with
the
same
name
this
is
all
documented
in
the
xt
specification

kevin
is
willing
mail
his
setup
files
to
inquirers
this
method
of
organizing
your
personal
resources
has
the
following
benefits
easier
to
maintain
more
usable
fewer
resources
are
stored
in
the
x
server
in
the
resourcemanager
property
as
a
side
benefit
your
server
may
start
fractionally
quicker
since
it
doesnt
have
to
load
all
your
resources
applications
only
process
their
own
resources
never
have
to
sort
through
all
of
your
resources
to
find
the
ones
that
affect
them
it
also
has
drawbacks
the
application
that
you
are
interested
in
has
to
load
an
additional
file
every
time
it
starts
up
this
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
much
of
a
performance
difference
and
you
might
consider
this
a
huge
boon
to
usability
if
you
are
modifying
an
applications
resource
database
you
just
need
to
rerun
the
application
without
having
to
xrdb
again
xrdb
will
by
default
run
your
xdefaults
file
through
cpp
when
your
resources
are
split
out
into
multiple
resource
files
and
then
loaded
by
the
individual
client
programs
they
will
not
watch
out
for
this
i
had
c
style
comments
in
my
xdefaults
file
which
cpp
stripped
out
when
i
switched
to
this
method
of
distributed
resource
files
i
spent
several
frustrating
days
trying
to
figure
out
why
my
clients
were
not
finding
their
resources
xt
did
not
provide
any
error
message
when
it
encountered
the
c
style
comments
in
the
resource
files
it
simply
silently
aborted
processing
the
resource
file
the
loss
of
preprocessing
which
can
be
very
handy
eg
ifdef
color
is
enough
to
cause
some
people
to
dismiss
this
method
of
resource
management
you
may
also
run
into
some
clients
which
break
the
rules
for
example
neither
emacs
nor
xvt
will
find
their
resources
if
they
are
anywhere
other
than
in
xdefaults
when
starting
up
a
client
on
a
machine
that
does
not
share
files
with
the
machine
where
your
resources
are
stored
your
client
will
not
find
its
resources
loading
all
your
resources
into
the
server
will
guarantee
that
all
of
your
clients
will
always
find
their
resources
casey
leedom
caseygaussllnlgov
a
possible
compromise
suggestion
that
i
have
and
am
planning
on
trying
is
to
put
resources
for
all
my
heavily
used
clients
eg
xterm
into
my
xdefaults
file
and
to
use
the
separate
resources
files
method
for
clients
that
i
seldom
use
define
your
display
properly
client
programs
are
often
executed
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
in
that
situation
rather
than
setting
your
display
environment
variable
to
where
hostname
is
the
name
of
your
workstation
you
should
set
your
display
variable
to
or
by
doing
this
you
access
optimized
routines
that
know
that
the
server
is
on
the
same
machine
and
use
a
shared
memory
method
of
transferring
requests

email
jody
ed
clients
if
you
only
have
a
few
megabytes
of
ram
then
you
should
think
carefully
about
the
number
of
programs
you
are
running
think
also
about
the
kind
of
programs
you
are
running
for
example
is
there
a
smaller
clock
program
than
xclock
unfortunately
i
havent
really
noticed
that
programs
advertise
how
large
they
are
so
the
onus
is
on
us
to
do
the
research
and
spread
the
word
suggestions
on
better
alternatives
to
the
some
of
the
standard
clients
eg
xclock
xterm
xbiff
are
welcome
ed
ive
received
some
contradictory
advice
from
people
on
the
subject
of
x
client
programs
some
advocate
the
use
of
programs
that
are
strictly
xlib
based
since
xt
xaw
and
other
toolkits
are
rather
large
others
warn
us
that
other
applications
which
you
are
using
may
have
already
loaded
up
one
or
more
of
these
shared
libraries
in
this
case
using
a
nonxt
for
example
client
program
may
actually
increase
the
amount
of
ram
consumed
the
upshot
of
all
this
seems
to
be
dont
mix
toolkits
that
is
try
and
use
just
athena
clients
or
just
xview
clients
or
just
motif
clients
etc
if
you
use
more
than
one
then
youre
dragging
in
more
than
one
toolkit
library
know
your
environment
and
think
carefully
about
which
client
programs
would
work
best
together
in
that
environment

the

then
get

it

just
to
save
swap

as
xterm

this

you

brianwarkentineengsuncom

he
questions
whether
xvt
really
is
at
all
faster
than
xterm
for
instance
xvt
may
initialize
slightly
faster
but
compare
scrolling
speed
try
this
quickie
benchmark
bintime
dd
ifetctermcap
and
see
which
program
can
scroll
faster
also
while
xterm
may
be
slightly
larger
in
ram
requirements
we
dont
have
any
hard
numbers
here
does
anyone
else
shared
libraries
and
shared
text
segments
mean
that
xterms
paging
requirements
are
not
that
major
as
an
experiment
he
ripped
out
all
the
tek
stuff
from
xterm
but
it
made
little
difference
since
if
you
never
use
it
it
never
gets
brought
into
memory
so
here
we
stand
with
some
conflicting
reports
on
the
validity
of
xvt
over
xterm
in
summary
caveat
emptor
your
mileage
may
vary
if
you
can
provide

comes
a
suggestion
regarding
motif
text
field
widgets
i
noticed
that
during
data
entry
into
motif
text
field
widgets
i
was
getting
a
slight
lag
in
response
to
some
keystrokes
particularly
the
initial
one
in
the
field
examining
the
what
was
going
on
with
xscope
i
found
it
it
seems
that
when
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
is
nonzero
and
the
focus
is
on
a
text
field
widget
or
even
just
a
text
widget
the
ibeam
cursor
will
blink
every
time
the
cursor
appears
or
disappears
in
those
widgets
the
widget
code
is
making
a
request
to
the
server
copyarea
the
user
can
stop
this
by
setting
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
to
it
is
not
noticeable
on
a
sparc
but
it
does
make
a
little
difference
on
a
slower
system
this
specific
suggestion
can
probably
be
applied
in
general
to
lots
of
areas
consider
your
heavily
used
clients
are
there
any
minor
embellishments
that
can
be
turned

when

to
speed
up
applications
that
youre
developing
there
are
tons
of
things
you
can
do
some
that
stick
out
for
motif
programs
dont
set
xmfontlist
resources
for
individual
buttons
labels
lists
et
al
use
the
defaultfontlist
or
labelfontlist
or
whatever
resource
of
the
highestlevel
manager
widget
again
stick
to
as
few
fonts
as
possible
better
yet
dont
use
motif
at
all
its
an
absolute
pig
dont
create
and
destroy
widgets
on
the
fly
try
to
reuse
them
this
will
avoid
many
problems
with
buggy
toolkits
too
use
a
line
width
of
in
gcs
on
some
servers
this
makes
a
huge
difference
compress
and
collapse
multiple
expose
events
this
can
make
the
difference
between
a
fast
application
and
a
completely
unusable
one

just
a
small
remark
i
once
heard
that
using
a
better
malloc
function
would
greatly
increase
performance
of
xt
based
applications
since
they
use
malloc
heavily
they
suggested
trying
out
the
gnuy
malloc
but
i
didnt
find
the
time
yet
i
did
some
tests
on
small
programs
just
doing
malloc
and
free
and
the
differences
were
indeed
very
noticeable
somewhat
times
faster
any
confirmation
on
this
from
anyone
ed
andre
beck
andrebeckirsinftudresdende
unnecessary
noexpose
events
most
people
use
xcopyareaxcopyplane
as
fastest
blit
routines
but
they
forget
to
reset
graphicsexposures
in
the
gc
used
for
the
blits
this
will
cause
a
noexpose
event
every
blit
that
in
most
cases
only
puts
load
onto
the
connection
and
forces
the
client
to
run
through
its
eventloop
again
and
again
thousands
of
xchangegc
requests
this
gfx
context
switching
is
also
seen
in
most
handcoded
xapps
where
only
one
or
few
gcs
are
created
and
then
heavily
changed
again
and
again
xt
uses
a
definitely
better
mechanism
by
caching
and
sharing
a
lot
of
gcs
with
all
needed
parameters
this
will
remove
the
load
of
subsequent
xchangegc
requests
from
the
connection
by
moving
it
toward
the
client
startup
phase

i

i
will
reduce

usually

the
server
and
the
client
are
competing
for
the
same
cpu
as
your
server
when
you
run
it
on
the
same
machine
not
really
a
major
problem
except
that
the
client
and
the
server
are
in
absolute
synchronicity
and
are
context
thrashing
timothy
h
panton
thpwesthawkuucp
firstly
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
most
cpus
are
mostly
idle
xs
cpu
usage
is
bursty
so
the
chances
of
you
and
your
teammate
doing
something
cpuintensive
at
the
same
time
is
small
if
they
are
not
then
you
get
twice
the
cpumemory
available
for
your
action
the
second
factor
is
that
context
switches
are
expensive
using
cpus
halves
them
you
pay
a
price
due
to
the
overhead
of
going
over
the
network
but
this
is
offset
in
most
cases
by
the
improved
buffering
of
a
network
typically
vs
for
a
pipe

even
fewer

re

hello
when

if
you
recieve
an
error
message
saying
cannot
load
appdefaults
file
check
your
xapplresdir
environment
variable
and
then
put
the
file
builderxcessory
this
is
the
appdefaults
file
for
bx
in
the
directory
specified
by
the
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
if
you
dont
have
an
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
then
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
be
the
directory
where
the
builderxcessory
file
is
you
can
do
this
using
the
setenv
command
under
csh
note
that
the
name
ends
in
ad
so
you
will
have
to
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
bxnad
to
get
the
appdefaults
to
load
correctly
to
make
sure
the
the
appdefaults

can
be
read

make

a

if
you
look
closely
at
motif
you
will
see
that
it
is
just
mswindows
with
more
eyepleasing
color
and
texture
the
only
real
difference
is
that
an
ms
application
window
can
contain
other
toplevel
children
while
a
motif
application
window
launches
its
children
out
onto
the
desktop
aab
to
those
of
you
familiar
with
both
guis
is
this
correct
my
experience
aab
with
x
makes
me
think
that
this
msw
behavior
is
easily
duplicated
aab
with
but
i
dont
know
msw
another
important
difference
is
that
msw
doesnt
have
any
window
that
handle
sophisticated
geometry
management
like
xmform
also
i
believe
that
in
windows
youre
limited
to
of
resources
windows
menus
icons
etc
imho
this
whole
discussion
named
motif
looks
like
mswindogs
is
totally
stupid
the
only
thing
remotely
influenced
here
can
be
the
motif
window
manager
that
features
an
arrangement
of
buttons
and
menus
somewhat
similiar
to
this
of
the
msw
windowmanaging
agent
however
its
name
is
but
mwm
is
only
a
small
part
of
motif
in
fact
mwm
and
motif
can
work
without
each
other
and
if
one
doesnt
like
mwms
outfit
for
some
reason
he
switches
to
another
windowmanager
all
this
doesnt
influence
motif
which
is
a
toolkit
of
widgets
to
write
applications
and
this
toolkit
is
imho
uncomparable
to
msw
because
it
is
much
more
wellorganized
and
features
alot
of
goodies
more
than
the
msw
interface
you
cannot
say
a
porsche
looks
like
a
vw
kfer
only
because
they
have
the
wheel
and
the
gear
at
the
same
position
motif
and
msw
are
complete
different
worlds
only
one
element
of
the
motif
world
has
some
gear
and
wheel
at
the
same
position
as
msw

gui
study
do

want

let
me
point
out
that
both
guibased

textbased

both
have
a
language
one
happens
to
be
mouse
and
actionbased
and
the
other

true
but
thats
beside
the
point
this
is
a
fact
about
an
abstract
model
of
what
the
gui
users
are
doing
not
about
what
they
actually
are
doing
this
abstract
model
is
only
apparent
from
the
perpective
of
a
programmer
of
the
system
nb
some
users
may
see
it
too
but
only
when
they
put
aside
the
work
at
hand
and
start
thinking
like
a
programmer
im
not
saying
that
the
programmers
perspective
is
evil
or
stunted
after
all
thats
what
i
do
too
i
am
saying
that
ui
designers
must
carefully
distinguish
between
the
userprogrammer
conceptual
models
and
they
must
ultimately
serve
the
user
of
the
system
not
the
builder
of
the
system
i
dont
recall
the
actual
stats
but
something
like
in
people
can
be
categorized
as
a
symbol
manipulator
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
more
about
the
meaning
and
basis
for
this
claim
at
any
rate
i
dont
think
this
is
evidence
that
of
users
think
like
programmers
bankers
financial
analysts
structural
engineers
these
are
all
people
whose
work
you
could
characterize
as
primarily
symbol
manipulation
but
what
they
do
is
not
programming
and
programming
is
not
required
to
do
what
they
do
to
restate
my
previous
point

problems
using
graphic
context
with
athena
widgets
i
am
creating
a
graphics
program
using
the
athena
widgets
i
use
xlib
routines
to
install
a
custom
graphics
contex
by
obtaining
the
display
and
window
variables
with
the
xtwindowofobject
and
xtdisplayofobject
the
object
was
one
of
the
sub
widgets
the
problem
occurs
that
whenever
a
button
is
pressed
or
a
menu
is
selected
the
graphic
contex
reverts
to
the
orginal
one
i
tried
moving
the
allocation
of
the
graphic
context
before
the
allocation
of
the
buttons
but
nothing
changed
i
am
preforming
all
of
this
manipulation
before
calling

you

i

trying

the
current

directions
more
simply
id
like
to
know
which
c
toolkit
to
bet
on
for
use
in
a
new
long
term
project
i
have
the
same
problem
i
have
looked
at
motif
wwl
interviews
gina
and
a
few
variations
on
the
above
ive
also
done
a
cursory
examination
of
rogue
waves
viewh
i
like
viewhs
abstractions
best
of
all
of
the
toolkits
i
mentioned
but
the
resulting
code
looks
little
like
motif
and
i
have
little
confidence
that
this
software
will
catch
on
or
otherwise
result
in
significant
longevity
for
my
code
gina
allows
you
to
write
code
which
looks
a
great
deal
like
motif
and
also
makes
interesting
use
of
inheritance
but
the
resulting
code
is
almost
too
motiflike
and
is
certainly
not
significantly
less
verbose
than
equivalent
c
code
interviews
looks
promising
but
i
havent
found
a
free
version
with
motif
support
and
im
not
confident
how
widely
interviews
with
motif
support
will
be
adopted
and
what
if
any
specific
motif
support
will
be
available
over
time
the
other
libraries
produce
code
which
is
less
motiflike
but
which
does
not
make
sufficient
use
of
the
features
of
c
to
simplify
my
coding
task
at
this
point
my
inclination
is
to
write
my
motif
manipulation
routines
in
c
and
invoke
those
routines
from
my
c
code
using
simple
abstractions
suited
to
my
specific
task
later
if
osf
or
some
credible
standardssetting
body
comes
up
with
a
c
interface
to
motif
i
will
change
to
that
it
does
me
no
goo
to
write
in
c
if
my
choice
of
interfaces
leaves
me
with
code
which
leaves
me
tied
to
an
abstraction
which
is
not
consistent
with
the
industry
directions
its
better
to
take
a
standard
if
inferior
solution
for
now
than
to
go
with
a
slgihtly
superior
approach
which
will
leave
me
with
both
useless
code
and
useless
skills
a
few
years
from
now
viewsh
is
the
only
library
id
consider
right
now
but
in
our
environment
wed
end
up
spending
nearly
to
use
it
and
i
cant
justify
it
when
its
likely
to
cause
shortterm
productivity
decreases
as
we
learn
the
new
abstraction
and
is
unlikely
to
be
a
sufficiently
longlived
solution
for
us
to
reap
the
benefits
at

my
impression
is
that
most
people
use
motif
because
their
os
vendor
supplies
it
with
x
sunos
users
excluded
and
because
it
is
similar
in
look
and
feel
to
mswindows
and
pm
personally
i
also
prefer
the
look
and

of
motif
no

please
just
an
opinion
seeing
as
motif
has
been
adopted
by
sun
ibm
hp
cant
remeber
the
other
members
in
the
recent
announcement
im
sure
youll
see
it
on
virtually
every
workstation
ie
sun
ibm
hp
and
dec
must
make
up
the
vast
majority
of
all
hardware
i
am
also
concerned
by
this
prevalence
of
motif
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
writing
and
obtaining
free
software
as
the
linux
and
communities
grow
however
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
its
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommercial
marketplace
ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is
cost
recovery
for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
side
note
all
the
x
based
code
i
am
writing
and
will
distribute
freely
when
completed
is
based
on

because
from
a

has
an
paper
by

titled
building

without
doing
a
complete
review
of
the

ill
just
mention
the
goals
as
stated
in
one
section
of
the
article
the
effort
has
the
goal
of
providing
the
next
generation
toolkit
with
functionality
beyond
the
xt
toolkit
or
xlib
features
they
want
in
fresco
include
lightweight

such
as

hi
i
wonder
if
it
is
possible
for
a
parent
window
to
paint
over
the
area
of
its
childs
if
it
is
not
then
how
could
it
be
possible
to
implement
a
rubberband
across
multiple
xwindows
to
select
the
objects
that
are
displayed
one
in
each
window
hauke
if
you
specify
the
rootwindow
when
you
are
creating
your
gc
you
may
use
xlib
to
draw
over
multiple
windows
i
have
an
application
that
does
something
similar
for
rubber

re
motif
vs
athena
etc
in
article
bambikirkbuozau
david
j
hughes
writes
i
am
also
concerned
by
this
prevalence
of
motif
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
writing
and
obtaining
free
software
as
the
linux
and
communities
grow
however
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
its
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommercial
marketplace
ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is
cost
recovery
for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
active
linux
and
communities
are
populated
by
enthusiasts
who
would
object
to
paying
any
money
for
software
otherwise
they
would
probably
have
gone
for
a
commercial
unix
an
important
factor
in
the
linux
community
is
that
source
code
is
always
available
this
is
probably
similar
in
the
community
however
im
not
really
involved
there
many
people
using
linux
like
to
stay
at
the
cutting
bleeding
edge
ie
when
kernel
patches
c
library
or
compiler
patches
come
out
people
like
to
rebuild
their
entire
systems
the
prime
requirement
for
all
linux
software
is
that
it
is
available
under
a
gnu
style
public
license
hence
linux
software
uses
either
the
athena
widgets
or
xview
individuals
may
write
software
requiring
motif
but
i
doubt
it
is
widely
adopted

the

does
the

hardware
cursor

or
does
the

generate
a

cursor
you
can
generally
tell
the
difference
just
by
using
it
if
the
cursor
blinks
a
lot
when
theres
screen
activity
its
probably
a
software
cursor
if
it
has
a
hardware
cursor
i
think
youre
probably
battling

bug
in

im
not

chips
that
display
cursors
greater

quite
possible
that
the

echoing

actually
checking

vaguely
recall

just

you

only

why
if
just

every

will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for

platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
let
me
add
another
of
my
concerns
yes
i
can
buy
a
port
of
motif
for
cheap
but
i
cannot
get
the
source
for
cheap
hence
i
am
limited
to
using
whatever
x
libraries
the
motif
port
was
compiled
against
at
least
with
older
versions
of
motif
i
have
been
told
that
motif
can
be
used
with
any
x
but
i
have
not
seen
it
myself
currently
i
have
running
on
eight
different
unix
platforms
of
which
only
three
came
with
motif
on
those
three
i
am
unable
to
use
the
libraries
to
build
motif
clients
because
i
get
link
errors
between
the
vendorsupplied
port
of
motif
and
my
i
anticipate
having
this
same
problem
when
becomes
available
the
result
is
that
i
cannot
build
motif
clients
that
rely
on
since
i
do
not
have
motif
compiled
under
true
i
could
buy
another
port
of
motif
but
that
sort
of
ruins
the

this

advantage
since
rick
they
control
the
whole

there
are
no

this
where

this
happy

shows
a

that

have
when
they
are
pleased
with
something
that
works
and
they
believe

others
will

it
i
remember
when
sunview
was

am
not
by
that
statement
endorsing
sun

its

this
is
just
my

when

was
when
i
started
hearing
as

the

that
were
bent
on
destroying
anything
that
was
deemed
proprietary
including
openwindows
i
mentioned

that
is
what

i

mr

i

complaining

we

devloping
on

systems
using

platform
will
be
predominantly

probably
with

well
i
am
assuming
the
standard
dual

systems
are
configured
such
that
we
are
talking
about
one
x
display
and
multiple

and
not
multiple

given
this
is
changing
input
focus
from
one
screen
to
the

as
simple
as
tracking
your

from

theres
nothing
special
that
needs
to
be
done
to
shift

do
i
have

managers
on
the
separate

or
are
there
multiscreen

out
there
what
are
they
who
sells
them
is
a

manager
the
only
way
i
can
grab
a
window
frame
and
move
a
window
from
one
screen
to
the
next
is
there
any
way
for
the
application
to
transparently
see
multiple
screens
as
one
logical
xy
plane
or
does
the
hardware
only
provide
for
each

to
start
at
any
thoughts
on
the
difficulties
involved
with
designing
a
system
capable
of
using
either
multiple
screens
or
a
single
screen
perhaps
running
a
virtual
window
manager
to
simulate
multiple
screens
instead
i
am
assuming
that
this
is
not
a
major
issue
that
i
can
rely
on
providing
config
files
which
will
specify
for
each
configuration
the

placement
of
each

in

so
the

are
not
even
a
real

my
ideal
operating

binary

it

configure

so
i
dont

no

the
strict
meaning
of
multidisplay
would
refer
to
a
system
with
multiple
keyboards
and
pointers
when
its
used
it
probably
refers
to
the
same
thing
multiscreen
would
a
system
that
provides
multiple
screens
zaphod
is
a
term
applied
to
the
way
the
mit
server
switches
the
pointer
from
one
screen
to
another
by
sliding
it
off
the
side
of
the
screen
is
there
a
limit
how
many

can
handle
in

a
read
something
about
an
upper
limit
of
there
is
a
protocol
limitation
that
restricts
a
given
display
to
at
most
screens
i
know
of
no
server
that
handles
multiple
displays
on
a
single
invocation
unless
possibly
my
kludges
to
the
server
can
be
looked
upon
as
such
on
a
tcpbased
system
there
is
necessarily
a
limit
of
displays
per
machine
but
this
is
not
a
limitation
inherent
to
x
what
you
read

most
likely
talking
about

a
problem
occurs
when
i
try

is
different
from
the
visual
of
the
parent
which
uses
the
default
visual
which
is
in
the
xlib
reference
guide
from
o
reilly
one
can
read
in
the
section
about
xcteatewindow
something
like
in
the
current
implementation
of
when
using
a
visual
other
than
the
parents
be
sure
to
create
or
find
a
suitable
colourmap
which
is
to
be
used
in
the
window
attributes
when
creating
or
else
a
badmatch
occurs
this
warning
strangely
enough
is
only
mentioned
in
the
newer
editions
of
the
guides
it
applies
with
equal
force
to
earlier
versions
presumably
only
recently
did
the
authors
decide
it
was
important
enough
to
mention
the
necessity
it
refers
to
has
always
been
there
but
its
been
implicit
in
the
way
createwindow
requests
default
some
attributes
of
the
new
window
however
even
if
i
pass
along
a
suitable
colourmap
i
still
get
a
badmatch
when
i
create

with
a
nondefault
visual
attrcolormap
cmap

xcreatewindow
copyfromparent
border
width
depth
inputoutput
class
vinfovisual
visual

this
is
because
the
warning
you
read
is
incomplete
you
have
to
provide
not
only
a
colormap
but
also
a
border
the
default
border
is
copyfromparent
which
is
not
valid
when
the
windows
depth
doesnt
match
its
parents
specify
a
borderpixmap
of
the
correct
depth
or
a
borderpixel
and
the
problem
should
go
away
there
is
another
problem
i
cant
find
anything
to
indicate
that
copyfromparent
makes
any
sense
as
the
borderwidth
parameter
to
xcreatewindow
your
xlib
implementation
probably
defines
copyfromparent
as
zero
to
simplify
the
conversion
to
wire
format
so
you
are
unwittingly
asking
for
a
border
width
of
zero
due
to
the
xlib
implementation
not
providing
stricter
typechecking
to
be
fair
im
not
entirely

would

skipping

this

screensdisplays
a
single
server
can
handle
in
an
articel
a
read
something
about
an
upper
limit
of
how
is
the
capability
called
if
i
want
to
move
the
cursor
from
one
screendisplay
to
another
as
to
how
many
clients
may
be
display
on
a
server
i
believe
the
limit
would
be
how
much
memory
is
available
to
your
server
or
allocated
by
the
server
this
all
sounds
suspiciously
like
my
company
might
have
something
to
do
with
this
background
first
megatek
has
a
series
of
framebuffers
designed
as
x
accelerators
for
the
most
part
these
are
designed
for
sun
sbus
and
sun
and
other
vendors
vme
systems
that
said
megatek
products
support
multiscreen
andor
multidisplay
on
a
sigle
workstation
most
of
our
cards
have
a
keyboardmouse
port
which
can
be
used
to
provide
additional
displays
for
example
say
you
hade
a
sparcstation
with
an
sbus
expansion
chassis
you
could
put
in
six
frambuffers
allowing
a
total
of
six
screens
in
the
system
you
could
then
attach
from
to
keyboardmice
allowing
you
to
mix
and
match
any
combination
of
screens
and
displays
you
could
have
display
displays
displays
or
display
and
display
basically
any
combination
because
of
this
we
at
megatek
try
to
be
very
careful
about
the
use
of
the
words
multiscreen
and
multidisplay
they
are
quite
different
in
meaning
and
at
least
in
x
have
exact
definitions
the
reason
i
ramble
like
this
is
the
mention
of
an
upper
limit
if
screens
in
a
display
as
it
so
happens
theres
a
define
in
the
server
that
determines
the
most
screens
supported
serverincludemisch
maxscreens
as
released
my
mit
this
is
as
released
by
megatek
this
is
as
such
the
most
screens
supported
by
a
single
megatek
display
ie
x
server
is
if
someone
construed
this
to
be
a
limitation
of
x
im
sorry
but
clearly
as
pointed
out
so
well
by
mr
neto
this
is
not
the
case
we
just
did
it
here
because
nobody
has
ever
asked
us
for
more
of
course
i
could

the

also

nothing

then
how
can
the

not
the

is
there
something
in

re

heres
what
i
think
have
figured
out
all
i
need
to
do
is
install
the
disitribution
without
the
xserver
like
the
sonycf
file
defines
and
all
the
new
libraries
utils
etc
will
be
installed
and
my
old
server
from
will
still
work
this
will
allow
me
to
run
xview
and
have
up
and
running
does
the
server
interface
remain
the
same
with
all
changes
made
only
to
the
libs
another
question
is
it
likely
that
since
sun
is
dropping
ow
support
that
the
desktop
utils
like
the
file
manager
will
be
made
public
it
would
be
nice
if
companies
would
make
old

for

forgive
me
if
this

a
faq
i
have
checked
the
list
but
i
cant
find
it
i
have
a
problem
with
the
cursor
within
xterm
on
mono
not
grayscale
monitors
the
problem
is
that
when
i
have
an
character
application
that
displays
input
fields
in
reverse
video
the
xterm
text
cursor
gets
lost
on
the
edge
of
the
input
field
the
solution
would
appear
to
be
to
set
the
xterm
cursor
to
a
line
rather
than
a
block
but
how
do
you
do
this
i
cant
find
any
means
although
various
sources
seem
to
indicate
it
can
be
done
when
the
xterm
loses
the
input
focus
the
cursor
becomes
an
outlined
block
this
would
also
be
preferable
but
i
cant
seem
to
force
this
to
be
the
default

and

you

these

dont

xtquerygeometry
returns

the

cannot

you

suppose
you

this

clearly

instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the

in

let
the

handler
take
care
of
rendering
the

because
at
that

it

the
problem
of

is
that

each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our

with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a

plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your

xview
slider
hi
netters
im
using
sliders
in
my
xview
apps
usually
with
editable
numeric
field
but
i
seem
to
have
no
control
over
the
length
of
this
field
in
some
apps
it
appears
long
enough
to
keep
several
characters
in
some
it
cannot
keep
even
the
maximum
value
set
by
panelmaxvalue
as
i
understand
panelvaluedisplaylength
which
controls
number
of
characters
to
be
displayed
in
text
items
doesnt
work
in
the
case
of
slider
despite
the
fact
that
panelh
contains
the
following
bit
panelmultilinetextitem
panelnumerictextitem
panelslideritem
and
paneltextitem
attributes
panelnotifylevel
panelattrattrenum
panelvaluedisplaylength
panelattrattrint
which
gives
a
hint
that
this
attribute
can
be
used
for
sliders
but
setting
this
attribute
gives
nothing
and
xvgetting
this
attribute
gives
warning
bad
attribute
and
return
value
can
someone
share
his
experience
in
managing
sliders
in
xview
with
me
and
clear
this
problem
any
help
is
very
much
appreciated

the

monthly
question
about
xcopyarea
and
expose
events
posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part

you

i

a
peculiar
color
problem
with
macx
apples
macintosh
x
server
id
like
to
know
if
others
have
seen
the
same
problem
its
happened
with
the
current
version
and
with
version
when
some
types
of
client
windows
are
displayed
parts
of
the
windows
are
in
the
wrong
color
if
the
window
is
moved
slightly
forcing
the
server
to
repaint
it
it
is
repainted
in
the
correct
colors
it
doesnt
happen
for
xterm
windows
but
has
happened
for
graphic
windows
and
with
some
motif
clients
i
expect
what
is
going
on
here
is
that
your
colormap
is
full
and
when
the
new
application
starts
up
it
cannot
add
the
colors
that
it
needs
to
the
colormap
it
therefore
has
to
pick
and
choose
from
the
existing
colors
this
makes
it
look
ugly
until
its
window
gets
priority
then
macx
changes
the
colormap
so
that
the
selected
app
is
getting
the
exact
colors
it
wanted
but
now
other
applications
are
having
to
make
do
with
its
colormap
this
is
a
problem
with
all
color
x
servers
or
at
least
all
color
xservers
i
have
seen
when
the
demands
of
the
applications
exceed
the
size
of
the
colormap
my
solution
is
usually
to
avoid
colormapgreedy
apps
and
display
applications
where
color
is
just
icing
on
the
cake
in
monochrome
mode
rather
than
in
color
if
this
is
an
option

the

re
monthly
question
about
xcopyarea
and
expose
events
posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part
of
the
window
that
contains
the
new
item
what
is
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
to
produce
this
behavior
if
i
understand
your
problem
correctly
you
want
to
have
a
way
to
send
exposures
to
your
manager
widget
when
your
appspecific
code
draws
xlib
graphics
on
the
window
it
sounds
like
you
might
want
to
send
an
exposure
using
xsendevent
and
specifying
a
region
if
you
know
the
region
you
need
to
send
the
exposure
generally
you
have
the
bounding
rectangle
of
the
objects
you
can
use
xcreateregion
to
create
a
region
xunionrectwithregion
to
add
the
new
object
polygons
to
the
region
and
then
either
use
the
region
to
clip
your
gc
for
the
redraw
or
use
xrectinregion
to
test
which
of
your
other
objects
need
to
be
redrawn
keeping
in
mind
that
the
stacking
order
of
overlapping
objects
affects
how
they
look
hope
it
helps

in

im
running
on
an
display
for
which
ive
created
a
colormap
and
am
using
almost
all
of
the
colors
i
want
to
draw
the
lines
in
a

widget
a
widget
in
which
im
displaying
a
bitmap
using
xputimage
if
doesnt
matter
if
the
lines
i
draw
interactively
stay
around
when
the
window
is
refreshed
currently
to
draw
interactively
i
begin
with

is
an

i
reserve
for

when
im
all
done
to

to

i
do

what
id
like
to
happen
is
for
the
lines
i
draw
to
be
the
inverse
of
whatever
im
drawing
over
instead
what
happens
is
i
get
white
lines
if
the
lines
are
over
a
white
background
nothing
shows
up
if
the
lines
are
over
a
black
area
nothing
shows
up
its
very
strange
but
the
gxxor
function
seems
right
since
if
i
do
a
rubberbanding
box
it
erases
and
redraws
itself
correctly
ie
not
disturbing
the
underlying
image
any
suggestions
what
im
doing
wrong
i
believe
for
this
to
work
on
a
color
display
you
must
set
the
foreground
of
the
gc
to
be

return

this
sounds

if

this

question
because
i
got

pass

multiple

of
just
one

the

says
that
the
first
time
winopen
is
called
it
opens
a
connection
to
the

also
most
of
the

calls
do

posting
of
the
question
that
just
doesnt
seem
to
get
answered
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
using
an
expose
event
handler
is
a
proper
way
to
do
this
because
at
the
time
the
handler
is
called
the
xlib
window
is
guaranteed
to
be
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
already
visible
and
mapped
what
we
need
to
do
is
somehow
tickle
the
window
so
that
the
expose
handler
is
hit
with
arguments
that
will
enable
it
to
render
just
the
part
of
the
window
that
contains
the
new
item
what
is
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
to
produce
this
behavior
to
incrementally
update
the
contents
of

i
use
the
following
trick
set
the
window
background
to
none
call
xclearareadisplay
window
true
restore
the
window
background
to
its
correct
value
the
call
to
xcleararea
does
not
repaint
the
window
background
but
still
generates
exposure
events
for
visible
parts
of
the
window
in
order
to
let
my
application
know
that
these
expose
events
must
be
handled
incrementally
something
is
already
displayed
on
the
screen
and
may
need
to
be
erased
i
encapsulate
the

actually
i
must
also
ask
the
faqs
most
popular
reason
why
graphics
dont
show
up
do
you
wait
for
an
expose
event
before
drawing
your
rectangle
suppose
you
have
an
idle
app
with
a
realized
and
mapped
window
that
contains
xlib
graphics
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
expose
event
handler
take
care
of
rendering
the
image
because
at
that
time
it
is
guaranteed
that
the
window
is
mapped
the
problem
of
course
is
that
no
expose
event
is
generated
if
the
window
is
visible
and
mapped
do
you
know
the
best
way
to
tickle
a
window
so
that
the
expose
event
handler
will
be
invoked
to
draw
this
new
item
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
my
original
question
i
previously
stated
that
i
did
an
xcopyarea
of
the
pixmap
to
the
screen
just
to
make
sure
that
my
image
had
data
and
it
did
this
is
not
a
problem
with
expose
events
it
has
to
do
with
xcopyplane
not
working
does
anyone
have
a
code
fragment
they
could
send
demonstrating
that
xcopyplane
works
this
would
be
very
helpful
thanks
what
it
has
to
do
with
your
original
question
is
this
many
times
beginning
x
users
heck
experienced
x
users
too
write
small
test
programs
many
times
they
forget
to
draw
only
in
response
to
expose
events
and
thus
see
unpreditable
results
whereby
sometimes
the
applications
graphics
show
up
and
sometimes
they
dont
were
just
trying
to
eliminate
all
the
easy
explanations
for
why
youre
not
seeing
your
graphics
that
being
said
why
dont
you
try
copying
different
planes
to
your
window
other
than
try
to
see
it
you
get
any
output
since
youre
dipslaying
only
a
single
plane
of
your
data
its
possible
that
all
the
pixel
values
in
your
pixmap
have
the
same
value
for
that
color
plane

dear

i
am
writing
a
mixed

application
that
creates
a
couple
different
color
maps
for
different
windows
and
ive
been
having
trouble
getting
the
window
manager
to
reliably
honor
my
requests
in
some

entry
level
indigo
w
all
windows
are
getting
properly
connected
to
their
designated
color
maps
but
on
others
an
iris
also
a
different
entry
level
indigo
the
color
mapping
is
unreliable
and
changes
behavior
when
i
compile
at
different
times
the
most
common
problem
is
that
all
nontoplevel
windows
fail
to
be
displayed
according
to
their
colormap
my
application
starts
out
by
creating
three
toplevel
windows
in
some
cases
all
but
the
first
of
these
also
fail
to
be
displayed
by
their
colormap
this
is
spectacularly
aggravating
i
would
dearly
appreciate
an
explanation
of
the
standard
right
correct
way
to
give
a
window
a
colormap
such
that
the
window
manager
will
honor
and
obey
it
any
advice
about
problems
that
could
cause
my
failure
to
get

desired
colormaps

hello

my

running

m
tape

i
have
loaded
the
basic

which
includes
nsu
and
inet

tcpip
i
ftped
the
binaries
and
installed
properly
i
can
execute
startx
and
run
xwindows
with
no
problems
however
if
i
try
to
access
the
tape
drive
while
in
x
the
machine
locks
up
instantly
if
i
am
out
of
x
and
access
the
tape
the
tape
drive
works
fine
soon
as
i
try
to
startx
again
the
screen
changes
modes
but
the
grey
background
pattern
does
not
come
up
and
no
xterm
is
forked
i
have
to
login
from
another
terminal
and
execute
a
shutdown
to
reset
the
system
ive
contacted
esix
about
this
problem
they
claim
their
xwindow
server
which
i
have
works
with
the
wangtek
tape
drive
they
also
claim
i
only
need
the
nsu
network
system
utilities
to
run
x
i
dont
need
inet
tcpip
my
experience
has
been
that
i
need
both
to
get
to
work
im
not
too
concerned
about
having
to
load
both
nsu
and
inet
packages
to
get
x
to
work
unless
the
inet
package
is
causing
my
problem
i
would
like
to
get
both
x
and
my
tape
drive
to
coexist
on
the
same
system
if
you
can
shed
any
light
on
the
problem
it
would
be
appreciated
one
colleague
implied
this
might
be
a
hardware
conflict
if
this
is
true
what
direction
should
i
look
to
resolve
the
conflict

cursors
according
to
the
osfmotif
style
guide
one
should
use
cursor
shapes
to
give
the
user
a
visual
clue
of
what
is
happening
or
what
is
expected
of
him
so
a
hourglass
cursor
should
be
shown
when
the
application
is
busy
or
a
caution
cursor
should
be
shown
over
an
area
when
input
is
expected
in
another
defining
cursors
for
widgets
has
to
be
done
at
rather
low
level
so
defining
a
cursor
for
all
widgets
in
an
application
but
not
for
a
certain
subpart
of
it
is
a
rather
complicated
matter
when
cursors
have
been
defined
for
some
windows
eg
a
crosswire
cursor
for
a
drawingarea
things
get
even
more
complicated
my
intuition
says
that
things
should
be
easier
but
is
this
so
if
anyone
has
a
solid
and
complete
solution
to
my
problem
please
let
me
know
the
topics
on
busy
cursors
in
the
several
faqs
are
not

since
they
only
work
for

where

option
in
the
menu
contained
in
the
xterm
runs
a
fortran
subroutine
that
creats
a
tektronicsmode
xterm
for
displaying
some
graphics
typing
a
ret
while
the
tektronicsmode
xterm
future
reference
to
this
will
be
tekterm
is
active
makes
the
xterm
read
future
keystrokes
but
does
not
shift
input
focus
to
the
xterm
im
basing
that
statement
on
the
fact
that
the
border
of
the
tekterm
stays
the
highlighted
color
and
that
the
tekterm
stays
on
top
of
xterm
if
what
im
describing
isnt
input
focus
let
me
know
the
xterm
can
be
brought
to
the
top
by
clicking
the
mouse
button
on
it
subsequent
selections
from
the
xterm
of
the
menu
item
that
displays
graphics
highlihts
the
border
and
displays
the
updated
graphics
but
does
not
move
the
tekterm
to
the
top
if
the
tekterm
has
been
iconized
to
conserve
screen
space
it
stays
an
icon
the
desired
behavior
one
of
two
options
whichever
of
the
windows
that
is
active
is
always
on
top
of
the
inactive
one
whenever
the
tekterm
is
inactivated
it
should
revert
to
a
icon
but
when
it
is
activated
it
should
become
a
window
on
a
higher
level
than
the
xterm
what
i
think
i
need
a
means
of
specifying
that
a
xterm
or
tekterm
will
be
at
the
highest
level
and
a
way
to
iconifyexpand
a
xterm
and
tekterm
these
commands
would
id
guess
need
to
be
in
the
fortran
or
in
the
command
that
starts
up
the
xterm
and
tekterm
other
information
all
this

gl
i
believe
is
it
possible

can
i
use

subroutines
in

in

opened

with

you
cant
make

in

for
sure
there
is
a
widget
already
defined
for
gl
it
is
the
glxmdraw
motif
or
glxdraw
athena
widget
it
is
similar
to
a
xmdrawingarea
except
that
it
allows
you
to
use
gl
calls
to
render
into
the
window
look
at
glxlink
glxunlink
glxgetconfig
and
glxwinset
in
the
man
pages
the
glxmdraw
widget
works
pretty
well
opengl
will
be
an
improvement
i
can
vouch
for
that
the
gl
widget
works
pretty
well
i
have
been
using
it
for
sometime
now
im
not
sure
though
whether
you
can
use
xlib
calls
to
draw
into
the
gl
widget
i
havent
tried
it
yet
nor
have
i
read
the
accompanying
documentation
completely
try
posting
to
compsyssgi
for
more
information
better
stillyou
will
find
most
of
the
answers
in

manuals
there
is
a
little
transition
guide
which
explains
the
mixedmodel
programming
paradigmmixing
x
and
gl
does
pex
graphigs
have
the
same
functionality
of
gl
i
think
gl
is
a
little
easier
to
use
and
a
little
more
powerful
but
thats
just
an
opinion
mileage
may
vary
well
pex
is
designed
as
an
extension
to
x
and
will
be
more
seamless
but
then
it
is
buggy

start
with
opinions

hi
im

so
please
bear
with

two
years
ago
i
wrote
a

application

fast
animation
of
raster
files
with
sunview
becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from
memory
pixrects
to
a
canvas
this
was
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
using
xputimage
your
source
is
maintained
by
the
client
and
the
destination
is
maintained
by
the
server
thus
you
incur
the
overhead
of
transporting
through
whatever
clientserver
communications
mechanism
you
are
using
is
it
possible
for
you
to
maintain
your
source
images
in
pixmaps
these
are
maintained
by
the
server
so
copying
them
into
a
window
is
much
cheaper
also
make
sure
you
are
not
sending
any
unnecessary
xsyncs

running
in
xsynchonize
mode
if
you
need
speed
and
your
client
can
run
on
the

the

you
should
use
the

xquerybestcursor

some
one
asked
me
recently
why
they
when
they
used
xquerybestcursor
to
see
if
they
could
create
of
a
given
size
it
seemed
to
imply
they
could
but
the
server
did
not
create
cursors
of
that
size
investigation
showed
that
some
x
servers
will
happily
return
any
size
up
to
the
size
of
the
root
window
while
others
return
some
fixed
limit
of
more
reasonable
size
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
the
same
server
binary
acts
differently
on
different
hardware
a

a

claim
cursors
up
to

window
size
are

also

this

on

also
occurs
on

actually
the

is

more

much
larger
then
the

are

i
have
a

hanging

also
running

presently
i
am
using

for

on

using

xdm
is
basically
just
an

shouldnt
i
be
able
to
run
xdm
on
the
decnet
protocol
tower
as
well
xdm
is
not
just
an
x

client
xdm
has
its
own
protocol
xdmcp
that
operates
of
ucp
on

it
does
provide
a
login
window
which
is
an
x

client
as
to
using
decnet
protocol
looking
through
the
source
for
xdm
from
that
i
have
here
it
seems
that
the
bare
bones
code
is
there
but
not
completely
there
my
first
inclination
is
that
xdm
is
not
your
typical
x
client
it
is
making
tcpip
specific
socket
calls
in
this
case
the
answer
would
be
no
you
can
not
run
xdm
over
decnet
is
this
right

not
any
feedback
is

not

many
of

have
contructs

this
is
a
makefile
at
the
start
of
lines
to
pass
makefile
comments
thru
the
c
preprocessor
and
into
the
makefile
most
of
the
c
preprocessors
that
i
have
used
will
not
treat
such
a
as
appearing
at
the
start
of
the
line
thus
the
c
preprocessor
does
not
treat
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
however
the
ibm
cpp
strips
the
comment
and
treats
the
hash
symbol
as
the
start
of
a
directive
the
cpp
fails
when
it
determines
that
this
is
not
a
known
directive
i
have
temporarily
hacked
my
imake
to
handle
this
situation
but
would
like
to
come
up
with
a
better
fix
several
imakefiles
use
as
a
parameter
to
a
macro
when
a
particular
use
of
the
macro
does
not
need
a
value
for
the
parameter
the
aix
cpp
gives
warnings
about
these
situations
but
continues
to
work
ok
if
you
are
familiar
with
these
problems
and
have
solutions
i
would
appreciate
information
about
on
your
solutions
perhaps
this
is
solved
in

also
do

i
have
a
question
regarding
the
processing
of
program
arguments
such
as
the
geometry
option
since
this
is
a
standard
x
option
im
wondering
wether
i
have
to
parse
it
manually
or
whether
there
is
some
predefined
function
that
will
do
this
for
me
thanks
for
any
info

what

i
get

are

nothing

nothing

its

the

seems
right
since
if

do

it

obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from

i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from
memory
pixrects
to

this
was
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seems
that
the

protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down

xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
my
question
is
what
is
the
fastest
way
in
to
dump

image
data
to
a

can
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the

the

the

setting

doesnt
it
doesnt

presses

detecting

poseted
for

okay
i
got
such
great
response
from
my
last
question
thanks
everyone
lets
try
again
how
can
i
tell
if
a
colorcell
is
readonly
i
want
to
use
any
readonly
cells
that
are
already
in
my
colormap
once
i
start
running
out
of
allocatable
cells
using
some
arbitrary
nearest
color
matching
scheme
to
get
those
cells
that
come
closest
to
a
requested
color
once
i
determine
if
a
cell
is
readonly
i
assume
i
can
then
just
request
an
xalloccolor
with
the
exact
same
color
specifications
and
it
will
then
be
flagged
as
used
by
my
application
so
that
it
doesnt
later
get
freed
by
someone
else
and
allocated
again
as
readwrite
to
another
application
so
far
the
only
way
ive
figured
out
to
do
this
is
to
write
my
own
error
handler
and
just
go
ahead
and
request
the
cells
colors
once
my
colormap
is
all
full
up
it
should
error
out
if
the
cell
is
nonshareable
but
life
would
be
much
easier
if
i
could
just
detect
the
readonlyshareable
stuff
directly

question

hello

suggest
an
answer

the

question
i
am
a
total
x
novice
and
would
appreciate
any
suggestions
you
may
have
i
am
trying
to
create
a
simple
drawing
tool
lets
say
i
have
two
rectangles
on
the
canvassee
above
one
intersecting
the
other
now
i
would
like
to
delete
one
of
the
rectangles
the
way
i
do
it
is
to
create
another
gc
wherein
i
use
the
gxxor
logical
function
and
simply
redraw
the
rectangle
using
the
newly
created
graphics
context
thus
deleting
it
for
all
apparent
purposes
a
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
at
the
points
of
intersection
the
pixel
locations
belonging
to
the
other
rectangle
also
become
white
which
is
something
that
should
be
avoided
is
there
any
way
i
can
avoid
this
problem
without
having
to
redraw
the
other
rectangle
too
i
also
would
not
like
to
generate
an
expose
event
for
the
affected
area
as
this
degrades
performance
very
badly

animation
is
most
frequently
done
by
copying
the

pixmaps
using
xputimage
once
this
is
done
the
original

can

the

can
be
performed
using

john
i
just

this
and
it

i
can
just
about
achieve
the
display
rates
frames
sec
on
ipx
that
i
get
with
sunview
though
its
a
bit
choppy
at
times
also
loading
the
data
making
an
ximage
then
xputing
it
into
a
pixmap
is
a
bit
cumbersome
so
the
animation
is
slower
to
load
than
with

is
there
a
better
way
to
load
in

vanishing

problem
a

has
a

problem
on

first
logs
on

xdm
he
has
a
single
xterm
window
appear
with
the
mwm
window
manager
running
in
this
configuration
x
windows
applications
particularly
xdvi
work
fine
however
if
he
opens
up
a
second
xterm
application
suddenly
xdvi
cannot
start
in
either
window
giving
the
error
unable
to
load
iso
font
the
only
difference
between
the
two
xterm
windows
is
that
the
initial
one
references
a
different
name
in
the
xsession
file
with
prettier
colours
and
other
slight
changes
further
investigation
shows
that
only
opening
a
default
xterm
causes
this
behaviour
and
more
significant
all
x
applications
can
no
longer
load
any
fonts
if
they
are
invoked
from
the
command
line
in
either
window
if
i
start
the
xterm
with
a
different
font
using
the
fn
option
no
problems
it
would
seem
that
the
default
xterm
is
loading
a
font
which
somehow
causes
the
server
to
lose
all
of
its
fonts
note
xlsfonts
in
either
window
shows
all
of
the
fonts
available
so
there
doesnt
appear
to
be
a
problem
in
the
font
directorieshashtables
other
than
rewriting
the

to
use

hello
i

testing
a

architecture
machines
i
am
seeing
a
strange
problem
with
text
in
clients
like
xvt
a
simple
terminal
emulator
program
the
problem
manifests
it
self
when
the
shell
echoes
typed
characters
back
to
the
server
for
display
one
at
a
time
the
characters
appear
to
be
too
closely
spaced
with
the
result
being
that
the
character
echoed
destroys
the
rightmost
edge
of
the
first
character
then
the
character
destroys
the
rightmost
edge
of
the
second
character
and
so
on
it
looks
like
there
is
an
invisible
boundary
around
a
character
which
obscures
a
portion
of
the
previous
character
there
is
no
problem
between
the
characters
when
the
shell
returns
a
complete
line
of
text
only
when
the
output
is
a
series
of
individual
characters

anyone
has

the
problem
might

report
on
the
same
subject
can
anybody
help
me
out
the
problem
is
that
motif
uses
xgrabkey
to
implement
menu
accelerators
and
these
grabs
are
specific
about
which
modifiers
apply
unfortunately
the
specification
for
xgrabkey
doesnt
allow
anymodifier
to
be
combined
with
other
modifiers
which
is
exactly
what
would
be
desired
in
this
case
ctrl
anykeyq
in
ora
vol
in
the
section
on
accelerators
it
says
for
information
on
how
to
specify
translation
tables
see
vol
this
is
so
you
know
what
to
put
for
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
if
you
go
to
vol
it
says
likewise
if
a
modifier
is
specified
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
other
modifiers
from
being
present
as
well
for
example
the
translation
shiftkeyq
quit
will
take
effect
even
if
the
ctrl
key
is
held
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
shift
key
and
the
q
key
this
is
true
for
accelerators
and
mnemonics
which
are
implemented
using
event
handlers
instead
of
grabs
its
not
true
for
menu
accelerators
if
youre
a
motif
implementor
id
suggest
lobbying
to
get
the
xlib
semantics
changed
to
support
the
feature
i
described
above
otherwise
change
the
documentation
for
menu
accelerators
to
properly
set
the
users
expectations
because
menu
accelerators
are
not
the
same
thing
as
translations
is
it
possible
to
supply
accelerator
for
a
menu
entry
if
you
mean
menu
accelerator
no
its
not
possible
thats
according
to
the
definition
of
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
in
the
xmlabel
manual
page
keep
in
mind
when
answering
this
question
that
when
using
motif
you
cant
use
xtinstallaccelerators
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
not
how
can
you
ensure
that
accelerators
work
the
same
independent
of
case
what
i
want
is
ctrlo
and
ctrlo
to
both
be
accelerators
on
one
menu
entry
there
is
a
workaround
for
motif
users
in
addition
to
the
normal
menu
accelerator
you
install
on
the
xmpushbuttongadget
set
an
xtnaccelerators
resource
on
the
shell
toplevel
or
application
install
the
shells
accelerators
on
itself
and
all
of
its
descendants
with
xtinstallallaccelerators

example

ctrlkeyq

you
have
to
write
and
add
the
application
action
performaction
which
you
can
implement
by
using
xtnametowidget
on
the
first
argument
and
then
xtcallactionproc
with
the
rest
of
the
arguments
i
tested
out
something
similar
to
this
to
shorten
development
time
i
used
teleuses
tuninstallaccelerators
resource
to
install
the
accelerators
on
the
shell
and
i
directly
invoked
the
open
and
quit
d
actions
instead
of
asking
the
pushbuttons
to
do
it
for
me
but
the
more
general
approach
i
described

theres
documentation
on
how
to
use
the
shared
memory
extension
in
the
distribution
actually
i
just
finished
writing
a
motif
animation
program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast
when
using
onserver
pixmaps
or
shared
memory
i
had
to
insert
a
delay
loop
to
keep
it
from
going
too
quickly
testing
both
methods
side
by
side
they
were
just
about
equal
the
advantage
of
shm
is
that
your
x
server
doesnt
grow
to
ridiculous
sizes
but
pixmaps
can
work
over
a
network
and
are
removed
if
your
application
dies
one
tends
to
use
ipcrm
manually
quite
a
bit
when
debugging
shm
apps
shared
memory
also
has
the
problem
that
some
operating
systems
eg
ultrix
seem
to
allow
only
a
small
number
of
segments
to
be
attached
to
a
process
at
once
consequently
a
redraw
becomes
xshmattachxshmputimagexshmdetach
on
dec
systems
and
decs
bit
displays
like
the
ones
i
tend
to
use
most
often
dont
seem
to
support
the
extension
maybe
someone
compiled
them
wrong
and
using
pixmaps
causes
the
x
server
to
crash
failed
mallocs
so
one
has
to
use
the
local
unix
domain
socket
which
really
isnt
that
bad
one
copies
the
info
three
times
per
redraw
instead
of
one
in
short
allowing
all
three
forms
of
display
within
the
program
is
a
good
thing
minus
shm
if
running
over
a
network
and
let
the
user
pick
whatever
feels
fastest

since

arent

i

usually
more

since
i

is
that

id
also
be
interested
in
looking
at
the
xview
code
mentioned
above
there
is
no
easy
answer
to
this
question
it
depends
on
whether
the
display
device
can
hold
pixmaps
in
offscreen
memory
and
if
so
how
efficiently
the
server
manages
these
resources
having
to
deal
with
limited
offscreen
memory
is
the
bane
of
the
server
implementors
existence
i
have
worked
with
graphics
devices
where
the
offscreen
memory
to
main
display
copy
rate
eclipses
that
of
the
main
memory
to
display
copy
rate
and
with
those
where
the
main
memory
to
display
is
faster
than
offscreen
to
display
requires
only
a
write
to
the
framebuffer
rather
than
a
read
of
the
fb
followed
by
a
write
if
your
server
uses
the
cfb
code
or
something
like
it
to
render
into
pixmaps
in
cpu
main
memory
the
rates
you
can
get
through
mitshm
are
likely
to
be
equal
maybe
a
tad
slower
depending
on
your
oss
implementation
of
shared
memory
to
copyarea
from
pixmap
to
window
which
is
also
then
just
a
copy
from
cpu
main
memory
to
graphics
device
one
advanage
of
mitshm
is
that
if
your
images
are
large
you
dont
end
up
growing
the
size
of
the
server
process
to
hold
them
one
disadvantage
of
the
mitshm
is
that
in
its
sample
implementation
there
is
no
provision
for
elegantly
cleaning
up
the
shared
memory
segments
if
the
client
dies
a
sudden
violent
death
eg
kill
you
have
to
be
mindful
of
cluttering
up
the
system
with
zombie

the

one

a

which
lots

have

written
i
am
sure
and
would
therefore
be
probably
be
a
subclass
of

rather
than
something
simple
like
an

class
is
this
more
difficult
in

not

alternatively
if
anyone

they

my

xcreatewindow

xmapwindow
xflush
xmovewindow
this

will
almost

break
calling
xmapwindow

then
xflush
does
not

isnt

find

the

report
on
the

subject
can
anybody
help
me
out
the
problem
is
that
motif
uses
xgrabkey
to
implement
menu
accelerators
and
these
grabs
are
specific
about
which
modifiers
apply
unfortunately
the
specification
for
xgrabkey
doesnt
allow
anymodifier
to
be
combined
with
other
modifiers
which
is
exactly
what
would
be
desired
in
this
case
ctrl
anykeyq
in
ora
vol
in
the
section
on
accelerators
it
says
for
information
on
how
to
specify
translation
tables
see
vol
this
is
so
you
know
what
to
put
for
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
if
you
go
to
vol
it
says
likewise
if
a
modifier
is
specified
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
other
modifiers
from
being
present
as
well
for
example
the
translation
shiftkeyq
quit
will
take
effect
even
if
the
ctrl
key
is
held
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
shift
key
and
the
q
key
this
is
true
for
accelerators
and
mnemonics
which
are
implemented
using
event
handlers
instead
of
grabs
its
not
true
for
menu
accelerators
if
youre
a
motif
implementor
id
suggest
lobbying
to
get
the
xlib
semantics
changed
to
support
the
feature
i
described
above
otherwise
change
the
documentation
for
menu
accelerators
to
properly
set
the
users
expectations
because
menu
accelerators
are
not
the
same
thing
as
translations
is
it
possible
to
supply
accelerator
for
a
menu
entry
if
you
mean
menu
accelerator
no
its
not
possible
thats
according
to
the
definition
of
the
xmnaccelerator
resource
in
the
xmlabel
manual
page
keep
in
mind
when
answering
this
question
that
when
using
motif
you
cant
use
xtinstallaccelerators
i
cant
think
of
a
reason
why
not
how
can
you
ensure
that
accelerators
work
the
same
independent
of
case
what
i
want
is
ctrlo
and
ctrlo
to
both
be
accelerators
on
one
menu
entry
i
find
this
thread
on
motif
accelerators
absoultly
amazing
if
i
were
writing
an
interface
to
keyboard
accelerators
i
would
have
one
resource
called
accelerators
that
took
a
translation
table
period
i
would
also
implement
it
so
that
programmer
never
has
to
do
any
work
to
get
the
accelerators
installed
as
soon
as
the
enduser
specified
one
it
would
be
active
and
automatically
installed
to
get
multiple
accelerators
on
a
single
menu
item
id
do
something
like
menuitemaccelerators
override
n
ctrlkeym
fire
n
shiftkeyl
fire
n
the
accelerators
would
work
exactly
like
translations
and
you
would
automatically
see
a
ctrl
m
show
up
in
your
menuitem
object
why
in
the
world
is
the
motif

so
complicated
with
so
many

special
cases

attach

if

you
will
see
that
the

only
dies
after
all

are
gone
now
if
the
client
dies
thats
one
attachment
gone
the
os
cleans
up
for
you
and
since
the
x
server
notices
the
client
has
dies
frees
up
its
resources
including
detaching
from

there
goes

no

re
question
regarding
overlaying
of
graphics
lets
say
i
have
two
rectangles
on
the
canvassee
above
one
intersecting
the
other
now
i
would
like
to
delete
one
of
the
rectangles
the
way
i
do
it
is
to
create
another
gc
wherein
i
use
the
gxxor
logical
function
and
simply
redraw
the
rectangle
using
the
newly
created
graphics
context
thus
deleting
it
for
all
apparent
purposes
a
problem
with
this
approach
is
that
at
the
points
of
intersection
the
pixel
locations
belonging
to
the
other
rectangle
also
become
white
which
is
something
that
should
be
avoided
you
could
set
up
a
bitmap
with
a
mask
in
it
clear
the
bitmap
draw
the
rectangle
to
be
deleted
with
gxor
draw
the
one
that
is
to
stay
with
gxclear
then
gxxor
the
entire
pixmap
with
the
screen
note
that
this
is
a
pretty
effective
way
of
animation
if
you
ever
need
to
do
that

one

which
lots

have

i
am
sure
and
would
therefore
be
probably
be
a

im
not
sure
what
youre

you
could
create
something
which
is
very
much
like
a
true
multicolumn

by
placing
several
lists
within
a
geometry
manager
and
putting
that
manager
within
an
automatic
scrolled
window
this
wouldnt
be
good
for
very
large
lists
but
you
might
consider
this
as
an
alternative
alternatively
if
anyone
has
a
multicolumn
list
widget
they
could
sell
me
this
might
save
me
from
having

does
it

unfortunately
it

that
the

varies
from

how
does
one
tell
what
mask
is
numlock

which
are

has

numlock
whereas

quite
like

you
can
actually
use

delete

i

completely
one
thing
i

about
the

its

for
most
work
the

are
times
faster
than
using
the

sure
it
is
a
plus
to
be

how

i
dont

it
is
too
much
to
ask
that

provide
not
only
a

interface
but
also
look
forward
to
those
who
would
like

usually

the

the

cpp
strips
the

unfortunately
it

is
there
an

means
of
determining
numlocks
mask
at

for

sorry
for
the
wasted

and
my
appalling
ignorance
youll
have
to
check
the
keysyms
on
each
of
the
keys
for
each
modifier
the
one
with
numlock
in
its
mapping
is
the
modifier
you
want
a
bit
ugly
perhaps
but
i
think
its
currently
the
only
way
to
do
this
and
it
does
have
some
precedent
as
keysyms
are
used
to
differentiate
capslock
from
shiftlock
for
the
lock
modifier
i
dont
know
of
an
accepted
strategy
for
handling
ambiguous
assignments
either
ie
what
if
numlock
is
mapped
for
more
then
one
modifier
i
suppose
first
found
is
as

any

that
i

can
someone
help
me
unfortunately
the
key
event
handling
is
pretty
much
hardwired
into
emacs
i
ran
into
this
problem
a
while
back
my
solution
was
to
change
the
source
code
so
that
all
of
these
special
keys
generated
character
sequences
which
basically
encoded
the
keysym
and
modifier
state
as
escape
sequences
for
example
the
sequence
esc
b
would
indicate
that
the
home
key
was
pressed
with
the
shift
key
down
you
could
also
detect
standard
keys
with
odd
modifiers
such
as
shiftreturn
if
anybody
wants
these
changes
theyre
welcome
to
them
but
youll
have
to
have
the
source
available
and
be
comfortable
munging
with
it
a
bit
basically
you
have
to
replace
the
keypress
handling
code
in
the
source
file
maybe
if
someone
at
osf
is
interested
i
can
send
them
the
tweaks
but
i
imagine
theyve
got
bigger
fish
to
fry
hopefully
including
the
much
talked
about
emacs
if
theres
sufficient
interest
ill
post
the
mods
somewhere
although
this
probably
isnt
the
appropriate
group
for
it
notes
this
special
code
will
only
apply
if
you
let
emacs
create
its
own
window
if
you
run
it
in
plain
old
tty

which
includes
xterm

apologies
if
im

something

in

our

has
been
losing
a
lot
of
articles
lately
so
i
havent
seen
the
faq
lately
to
check
two
ways
when
you
start
the
xterm
you
can
use
command
line
options
n
iconname
to
set
the
icon
label
t
windowtitle
to
set
the
window
title
title
windowtitle
equivalent
to
t
windowtitle
you
can
use
escape
sequences
to
change
things
on
the
fly
the
basic
escape
sequence
is
esc
p
somearbitarytext
bel
where
esc
and
bel
are
the
ascii
escape
and
bell
characters
p
is
an
ascii
decimal
digit
or
depending
on
whether
you
are
trying
to
set
the
window
or
icon
title
or
both
and
somearbitarytext
is
your
desired
label
string
hence
this
command
will
set
the
window
icon
title
echo
to
set
just
the
icon
title
echo
to
set
just
the
window
title
echo
of
course
you
may
have
to
fiddle
with
exact
syntax
depending
on
how
the
echo
command
works
on
your
system
and
what
shell
you
are
using
ive
shown
systemv
semantics
under
bourne
or
korn
shells
hint
for
sun
os
users
use
instead
of
binecho
or
cshs
builtin
echo
otherwise
youll
have
to
embed
literal
esc
and
bel
characters
in
the
string
instead
of
using
convenient
octal
sequences
if
you
want
your
titlebar
updated
continously
say
to
show
your
current
directory
hostname
or
somesuch
then
youll
have
to
see
if
you
can
coerce
your
shell
into
spitting
out
the
appropriate
escape
sequences
when
it
prompts
for

sometimes

greatly
received

also
for
a
pointer
in

one
solution
due
to
derek
ho
when
the
popup
is
popped
up
we
setvalue
its
location
which
on
repeat
popups
will
be
unchanged
from
the
previous
popup
the
slow
response
can
be
avoided
by
calling
getvalue
first
and
only
using
setvalue
if
the
required
location
is
different
the
problem
can
also
be
avoided
by
making
a
tiny
alteration
in
the
location
of
the
popup
so
that
the
setvalue
really
does
change
the
location
of
the
popup
we
tried
this
just
for
a
double
check
on
the
source
of
the
problem
the
solutions
we
have
tried
successfully
are
now
as
follows
use
twm
or
mwm
rather
than
olwm
use
olwm
with
resource
wmtimeout
only
reset
the
location
of
the
popup
window
if
it
is
truely
changed
this
is
obviously
working
around
some

somewhere

overriding
window
manager
focus
processing
i
am
working
on
an
xwindow
based
application
that
needs
to
override
some
of
the
window
manager
focus
processing
i
am
using
and
motif
currently
although
i
will
also
be
working
with
open
look
in
the
future
what
i
need
to
do
is
under
certain
circumstances
prevent
the
user
from
switching
from
one
window
of
the
application
to
another
window
lets
say
for
example
that
window
a
is
on
top
of
window
b
in
the
window
hierarchy
normally
if
the
user
clicks
the
mouse
in
window
b
it
will
be
brought
to
the
top
of
the
window
hierarchy
and
placed
on
top
of
window
a
under
certain
circumstances
if
the
user
clicks
the
mouse
in
window
b
i
need
to
beep
and
prevent
window
b
from
being
raised
on
top
of
window
a
from
the
research
and
testing
ive
done
so
far
it
appears
that
this
window
ordering
is
handled
by
the
window
manager
in
this
case
motif
i
havent
found
any
way
to
override
this
default
processing
through
standard
x
window
functions
i
can
tell
when
this
switching
occurs
through
focus
change
and
mapping
notify
events
but
i
cant
find
any
way
to
tell
motif
not
to
make
the
switch
the
temporary
solution
ive
currently
come
up
with
is
very
kludgy
but
it
partially
works
when
i
detect
such
a
window
switch
in
those
cases
when
the
switch
is
not
allowed
i
manually
force
the
formerly
top
window
back
on
top
with
an
xraisewindow
call
and
beep
with
the
xbell
function
this
provides
the
necessary
functionality
but
looks
ugly
when
the
windows
switch
places
twice
does
anyone
know
how
i
can
tell
motif
or
preferably
any
window
manager
when
i
dont
want
the
window
order
switch
to
actually
take
place

i
remember
you
should

then
use
something

that

i
think
this
is
correct
behavior
remember
the

colormapfocuspolicy
is
keyboard
meaning
the
cmap
focus
follows
the
keyboard
focus
since
the
dialog
is
modal
mwm
wont
allow
keyboard
focus
onto
your
main
shell
and
so
it
wont
allow
cmap
focus
either
since
it
sounds
as
though
you
have
keyboardfocuspolicypointer
i
suggest
you
set
colormapfocuspolicypointer
also
that
way
the
cmap
focus
wont
slavishly
follow
keyboard
focus
but
will
beat
its
own
path
if
you
have
keyboardfocuspolicy
explicit
you
can
set
cmap
focus
explicit
also

you
then

either
if

you
can
use

this

allows

without

you
need

a

youll

i
have

simply
because

must
confess
i
quite
like

because
you
can
actually
use
it
without
having
to
ever
touch

delete

rather
than
making
things
easier
and
there
should
always
be
the
option
to
do
it
your
way
if
you
want
to
which
is
why
i
like
the
unixx
combination
so
much
its
so
customizable
hear
hear
i
agree
completely
one
thing
i
cant
stand
about
the
mac
interface
is
its
shear
determination
to
force
you
to
use
the
mousewhat
if
your

breaksyour
whole

down
i
like
the
mouseit
is
handy
on
some
occassions
such
as
cut
and
past
and
moving
icons
around
etc
but
for
most
work
the
keyboard
and
hot
keys
are
times
faster
than
using
the
mouse
sure
it
is
a
plus
to
be
able
to
do
something
simple
if
you
are
an
inexperienced
user
but
how
long
is
it
before
your
are
experienced
a
month
two
speaking
of
pcs
at
the
moment
i
dont
think
it
is
too
much
to
ask
that
window
programmers
provide
not
only
a
menumouse
interface
but
also
look
forward
to
those
who
would
like
to
move
on
to
hot
keys
and
command
line
interfaces
which
usually
allows
you
to
do
more
in
less
time
if
you
are
experienced
all
of
the
above
equally
applies
to
windowing
systems
on
unix

unix

how
to
see
characterset
from
wchart
we
developed
a
toolkit
running
on
the
x
window
system
the
toolkit
copes
with
any
languages
based
on
facility
as
you
know
there
are
kinds
of
implementation
from
mits
release
xsi
and
ximp
our
original
implementation
of
the
toolkit
uses
xsi
our
toolkit
manages
each
characters
size
based
on
our
own
font
management
system
in
order
to
do
that
the
wchart
typed
character
strings
must
be
decomposed
to
character
sets
this
means
that
if
one
wchart
type
compound
string
with
ascii
and
kanji
mixed
for
example
is
given
each
element
of
the
wchart
array
must
be
checked
its
corresponding
character
set
based
on
a
bit
layout
and
application
environments
locale
in
this
case
if
the
locale
is
japanese
each
wchart
character
will
be
classified
either
to
or
so
we
need
a
function
to
do
this
the
function
must
check
how
many
characters
from
the
top
are
the
same
character
set
and
what
the
character
set
is
we
could
not
find
any
public
function
to
do
that
and
inevitably
used
xsis
internal
functions
to
construct
that
function
the
following
is
the
source
code
of
that
function
decomposecharacterset

copied

a
serious
issue
occured
when
we
tried
to
compile
a
toolkit
application
on
our
hp
machine
with
its

version
of
when
we
tried
to
link
an
application
based

link
errors
occured
saying
that
the
following
functions
are
missing
xmbctidtocsid
code
xmbfscs
code
xwcdecomposeglyphcharset
code
xfallbackconvert
code
we
had
used
mit
release
version
of
and
its
xsi
implementation
until
and
ran
applications
successfully
one
of
the
reasons
to
use
xsi
was
that
because
hp
did
not
release
hps
until
the
os
and
we
had
no
way
to
know
how
hps
would
be
implemented
we
had
hoped
xsis
popularity
and
used
its
internal
functions
the
hps
linker
complains
that
there
are
no
xsi
internal
functions
implemented
we
observe
from
hps
they
used
some
ximp
implementation
but
we
are
not
sure
if
they
used
mits
vanilla
ximp
version
or
their
own
version
of
ximp
and
therefore
finding
just
counter
part
functions
in
mits
ximp
for
xsi
does
not
seem
to
lead
us
a
solution
my
question
and
goal
is
to
know
how
we
can
construct
a
function
like
decomposecharacterset
listed
above
is
there
any
function
to
check
character
set
of
each
element
of
wchart
type
strings
depending
on
locales
if
it
is
a
public
function
that
is
perfect
but
even
if
it
is
not
we
want
to
use
any
internal
functions
in
hps
as
we
did
for
mits
in
order
to
render
a
wchart
type
string
there
must
be
some
machinery
to
judge
character
sets
and
that
is
how
the
proper
fonts
are
selected
for
the
string
we
have
no
way
to
find
out
that
without
any
hps
source
files
we
want
to
know
how
we
can
use
that
for
our
goal
any
help
or
comments
would
be
highly
appreciated
i
also
appreciate
if
anyone
tell
me
about
ximp
treating
around
this
area
even
if
it
is
not
hps
implementation
thank

re

shading
program
example
in
x
i
think
the
original
post
was
searching
for
existing
implementations
of
fi
gouroudshading
of
triangles
this
is
fairly
complex
to
do
with
plain
x
simpler
shading
models
are
implemented
already
fi
in
ask
archie
where
to
get
the
latest
version
for
gouroud
a
fast
implementation
will
be
possible
utilizing
some
extension
only
either
mitshm
to
do
the
shade
in
an
image
and
fast
update
the
window
with
it
or
pexopengl
which
should
be
able
to
shade
themselves
the
portable
vanilla
x
way
would
be
to
shade
in
a
normal
ximage
and
use
xputimage
what
would
be
good
enough
to
do
static
things
as
fi
fractal

such

especially
in

protocolfriendlyness

compliance
have
a
look
on
my
own

code
it
is
on
the
readme
states
the
points
where
it
is
better
than
xwindowc
from
povray
the
version
i
have
is
using

instead

i
have
it
currently
running

running

so
far

the

think
that
the

to

i

no

over
the

it

long

it

the

set

panelvaluedisplaylength

doesnt

im
not

if
this

acceptable

the

problems
i

are
the
colormap
though
huge
is
static
all
pixels
would
be
bytes
wide
because
the
hardware
actually
lives
in
yuv

the
translation
rgbyuv
will
introduce
some
rounding
error
being
more

a

than
a

i
ask
will
these
limitations
thwart
many

will
most

accept

theyre

could

maps

the

times
the

sending

its
a

to
the

is
this
a

perform
ive
also
tried
the

program
available
from

bombards
the

impression
andrew

i
dont

it
looks
like
either
the

is
supported
maintained

distributed
by
the

carnegie
mellon
the
distribution
terms
are
those
of
the

not
the
gnu
public

thus
anyone
can
commercially
exploit
the
andrew

without

to

however
we
defer
universal
release
of
the
latest

capabilities
to

an

is
best
on

linked

give

finger
helpatkitccmuedu

note
the

version
does
not
use
the

one

you
can
use
it
on
the
demo
by
changing
an
option
in
the

and
starting
a

the
andrew
toolkit
component
of
auis
is
ideal
if
you
want
to
build

using
compound

many

dont

they
just
start
throwing
xstorecolor
calls
at
you

both

of
the
window
system
right
why
should
one
trust
anything
else
they
have
to
say
i
used
to
think
this
way
and
not
just
about
x
for
example
incorrect
english
constructs
such
as
its
raining
or
its
window
id
annoy
me
however
there
comes
a
time
when
popular
usage
starts
to
dictate
the
way
things
really
are
in
the
world
indeed
the
fact
that
x
won
out
over
news
was
really
down
to
popular
opinion
i
know
we
all
think
its
technically
superior
as
well
on
a
related
topic
who
is
to
say
that
color
is
more
or
less
correct
than
colour
being
irish
and
hence
using
english
english
as
opposed
to
american
english
i
always
use
the
latter
except
of
course
for
api
terms
such
as
xalloccolor
and
colormap
in
a
world
that
uses
the
term
windows
to
refer
to
microsoft
windows
perhaps
the
time
has
come
to
accept
x
windows
as
a
valid
term
for
x
i
think
that
this
is
a
more
concise
and
uncluttered
term
than
say
the
x
window
system
and
lets
face
it
almost
everyone
uses
it
ultimately
we
all
need
product
sales
to
more
than
just
xliterate
people
in
this
respect
product
recognition
is
important
and
a
short
snappy
descriptive
title
x
is
positively
obscure
will
help
when
dealing
with
the
average
punter
its
sad
i
thought
i
was
a
software
engineer
indeed
it
is
unfortunate
that
x
did
not
become
popularly
known
as
windows
and
let
ms
worry
about
whether
it
should
be
called
microsoft
windows
or
the
microsoft
window
system
or
how
about
just
plain
microsoft
to
summarise
or
should
that
be
summarize
the
point
of
this
message
i
think
there
are
far
more
pressing
issues
facing
the
x
community
than
worrying
about
subtle
distinctions
in
the
naming
of
the
window
system
or
should
that
be
windowing
system
whatever
gets
recognised
is
fine
by
me
i
agree
that
one
should
be
careful
in
interpreting
what
trade
papers
say
however
i
would
be
reluctant
to
come
to
this
conclusion
purely
on
the
basis
of
how
they
name
the
x
window
system

i
do
think
its
worth
pointing
out
that
popular

not

excuse
in

for

i
think
an
appropriate
parallel
may

in
the

if
people
commonly
misspelled

mispronounced
your

would
you
feel
compelled

it
probably
not
the
same
is
true
of
x
the
x
window
system
x
and
related
monickers
are
proper
names
in
the
same
sense
that
any
product
name
is
a
proper
name
in
fact
some
of
them
are
trademarked
names
the
fact
that
many
people
get
them
wrong
is
largely
beside
the
point
as
for
the
trade
publications
that
promulgate
things
like
x
window
or
xwindows
or
any
of
the
other
nonsensical
variants
one
often
sees
consider
the
fact
that
these
publications
are
supposedly
written
by
journalists
would
you
trust
the
facts
of
a

couldnt

history
the
university
of
lowell
supported
by
a
grant
of
the
open
software
foundation
has
developed
a
wrapperlibrary
that
encapsulates
motif
widgets
in
c
classes
all
resources
of
these
widgets
can
now
be
set
through
memberfunctions
while
objects
can
be
used
in
callbackfunctions
the
library
was
made
available
for
free
or
nominal
cost
for
anonymous
ftp
at
however
the
library
contained
a
large
number
of
bugs
and
oversights
and
only
worked
under
due
to
lack
of
subsequent
fundings
the
bindings
are
no
longer
actively
supported
by
the
university
of
lowell
i
ronald
van
loon
at
a
certain
point
last
year
have
taken
the
lowell
bindings
fixing
the
bugs
i
came
across
adding
missing
memberfunctions
and
enhancing
functionality
and
made
the
bugfixed
library
available
for
the
general
public
for
anonymous
ftp
made
possible
by
rick
murphy
at
dec
new
release
i
am
now

to

additional

written
by
myself
that
can
be
used

application
imake
support
nb
this
release
relies
heavily
on
the
existence
of
imake
and
its
config
files
on
your
site
i
have
tried
to
provide
the
bindings
with
a
standard
makefile
tweakable
for
those
unfortunates
without
imake
i
have
not
severely
tested
the
standard
makefile
though
contact
me
if
you
have
problems
the
reason
for
calling
this
a
gamma
release
lies
in
the
fact
that
i
do
not
have
a
multitude
of
platforms
to
test
the
imakefiles
on
lots
of
testfiles
even
somewhat

have

certain

such

how
is
this
done
i
would
like
to
emulate
this
behavior
in

it
seems
a
reasonable
behavior
since
when
a
dialog
is
popped
up
from
a
keyboard
action
the
dialog
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
under
the
pointer
and
the
user
should
not
have
to
reach
for
the
mouse
just
to
move
the

alternatively
im
open
to
any
suggestions
as
to
what
is
the
right
way
to
insure
that
popups
get
the

when
they
appear

when
they
are

from

av
extension
to

dear
folks
its
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
announce
the
release
of
a
new
freeware
program
xavier
an
audio
and
video
extension
to
interviews
xavierextension
av
class
for
interviews
is
a
c
class
library
that
adds
multimedia
capability
to
interviews
it
allows
composite
multimedia
objects
to
be
built
from
media
objects
specifically
it
adds
audio
and
video
objects
to
the
classes
available
in
interviews
and
it
does
so
without
changing
the
source
code
for
the
original
classes
though
several
configuration
files
for
interviews
need
to
be
changed
via
a
patch
file
currently
the
xavier
audio
classes
are
only
supported
on
sun
workstations
with
an
audio
interface
such
as
the
xavier
has
been
tested
in

standard

were
specd
with
the

this
doesnt
mean
that
every

manager
author
in

immediately
dropped
everything
they
were
doing
and
implemented
this
at
top
priority
the
esge
server
we

makes
the

does
your

have

clut
since
standard

typically
devour
all
entries
there
is
no
way
it
can
avoid
displacing
the
entire
default
colormap
if
your
hardware
has
only
one
clut
i
dont
believe
standard
colormaps
are
intended
to
aboid
possible
colormap
flashing
between
clients
using
the
default
coilormap
rather
colormap
flashing
will
be
avoided
between
two
clients
that
use
the
same
standard
colormap
an
example
would
be
two
clients
that
need
a
full
color
range
would
both
use
xargbbestmap
or
whatever
its
called
under
if
you
are
trying
to
avoid
colormap
flashing
with
the
default
colormap
your
best
bet
is
to
try
to
load
all
the
colors
you
use
into
that
colormap
if
you
cant
do
that
then
youll
get
flashing
on
a
one
hw
clut
framebuffer
now
if
your
window
manager
used
the
same
standard
colormap
as
your
client
this
flashing
could
also
be
avoided
perhaps
some
window
managers
have
command
line
options
for
selecting
standard
colormaps

done
porting
to
a
new
piece
of
display
hardware
but
have
run
into
a
snag
i
think
may
be
somewhat
commonplace
so
im
sending
a
netfeeler
i
have
a
display
that
is
a
noninterlaced
memory
mapped
display
the
servers
view
of
the
world
obtained
via
xwd
xwud
seems
to
be
exactly
what
it
should
be
however
the
displayed
version
of
the
framebuffer
gives
the
impression
that
the
server
is
using
scanlines
that
are
too
long
after
a
bit
of
experimentation
it
seems
that
the
problem
was
that
the
server
was
padding
the
line
out
to
a
word
boundry
but
the
scanline
size
in
the
buffer
is
bytes
which
isnt
exactly
divisible
by
four
changing
the
following
defines
in
mitserverincludeservermdh
define
bitmapscanlinepad
define
define
to
define
bitmapscanlinepad
define
define
was
not
exactly
the
right
solution
how
do
i
tell
the
server
either
a
dont
pad
the
scan
lines
at
all
cause
this
server
is
only
being
built
to
run
on
this
particular
display
or
to
pad
only
to
byte
boundries
im
using
a
customized
version

keyboard
mapping
and
window
placement
questions
these
are
two
common
subjects
so
i
hope
someone
has
had
to
deal
with
these
specific
questions
if
my
application
depends
on
modifiers
what
is
the
best
lookup
method
my
choices
are
to
call
xgetmodifiermapping
for
each
key
press
with
a
modifier
or
make
the
call
once
at
the
init
of
the
app
and
store
the
modifiers
in
a
lookup
table
i
would
like
to
do
it
the
second
way
but
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
notify
when
the
user
uses
xmodmap
to
remap
the
modifiers
i
know
that
when
an
app
calls
xsetmodifiermapping
a
mappingnotify
event
is
generated
nonmaskable
which
i
can
pick
up
and
modify
my
internal
table
but
i
dont
seem
to
get
any
notify
events
when
the
user
uses
xmodmap
if
i
use
xt
all
oreilly
has
to
say
is
is
automatically
handled
by
xt
if
i
use
xlib
ala
xnextevent
i
get
nothing
this
all
stems
from
problems
with
users
of
the
sun
keyboard
and
the
numlock
plus
various
altmetaetc
modifier
requirements
i
would
like
to
place
a
popup
so
that
it
will
be
to
the
immediate
right
of
my
main
window
i
want
it
at
the
same
y
coord
and
their
rightleft
sides
touching
what
i
need
to
ask
for
is
the
xy
coord
of
the
window
managers
border
for
the
main
window
this
should
ring
a
bell
with
anyone
who
has
called
xtmovewidget
immediately
checking
the
xy
after
the
move
and
seeing
that
it
is
right
and
in
their
next
callback
asking
for
the
xy
and
seeing
that
it
is
now
offset

any

that
a

must
have
if
one
machine
running
dvx
is
supporting
multiple
users
clients
and
we
require
adequate
response
time
anyone
have
any
ideas
i
expect
the
limiting
factor
will
be
your
server
machine
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
example
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughly
people
using
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
boxes
novell
file
servers
and
each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
powerful
server
machine
because
of
the
significant
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
is
costly
and
the
bandwidth
limited
thats
why
my
interest
lies
in
seeing
if
such
a
link
can
be
used
and
see
what
traffic
goes
through
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
has
anyone
at
your
centre
monitored
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
running
any
standard
mswindows
programs
like
word
what
sort
of
packets
go
blazing
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
or
what
is
the
average
traffic
flow
going
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peaks
and
then
many
low
points
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your

connecting
a
digitiser
to
x
repost
hi
there
i
posted
this
to
compwindowsxintrinsics
but
got
no
response
so
im
posting
here
im
wanting
to
connect
a
digitiser
made
for
pcs
into
my
workstation
an
hp
it
is
my
understanding
the
x
windows
can
understand
a
variety
of
input
devices
including
digitiser
tablets
however
this
digitiser
makes
use
of
the
serial
port
so
there
would
seem
to
be
a
need
to
have
a
special
device
driver
the
hp
manual
pages
say
that
the
hp
x
server
will
accept
x
input
from
devices
listed
in
the
file
display
number
i
shouldnt
think
i
would
be
able
to
simply
insert
as
an
input
device
in
this
file
and
expect
a
digitiser
to
work
but
maybe
im
wrong
am
i
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
does
anybody
out
there
have
a
digitiser
connected
to
their
workstation
for
use
as
a
pointer
for
x
rather
than
just
as
input
to
a
specific
x
application
if
so
what
were
the
steps
required
for
installation
did
you
need
a
special
device
driver
did
the
manufacturer
supply
it
are
there
generic
public
domain
device
drivers
around
i
understand
that
digitisers
generally
use
only
a
couple
of
standard
formats
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated

a

in

i
decided
to
implement
an

using
created

this
is

i
was
redrawing
the

underneath
the
animated
cursor
and
then
restoring
the
standard
cursor
when
complete
i
found
dumped
core
and
upon
analysis
it
was
when
the
sigalrm
handler
was
called
during
a
xdrawstring
call
xdrawstring
was
doing
a
bcopy
presumably
an
internal

when
the
xdefinecursor
was
called
presumably
the
internal
structure
that
xdrawstring
was
manipulating
was
not
in
a
stable
state
and
sent
xdefinecursor
to
where
it
shouldnt
have
been
has
anyone
else
experienced
this
is
there
any
official
documentation
that
says
you
should
ensure
this
doesnt

german
keyboard
altgr
hi
ppl
i
am
running
under
linux
and
am
trying
to
get
the
german
keyboard
working
i
have
already
recompiled
my
kernel
and
the
german
keyboard
in
the
textmode
works
just
fine
i
have
found
out
that
there
is
a
preconfigured
german
keymap
for
x
called
xmodmapgr
in
so
i
ran
xmodmap
my
first
impression
was
very
good
i
was
able
to
get
z
and
y
straight
theres
still
a
little
problem
i
cant
solve
however
i
cannot
get
at
the
backslash
bar
brackets
and
curly
brackets
the
altgr
key
doesnt
seem
to
work
i
tried
xev
to
find
out
whether
it
produces
an
event
at
all
and
it
does
looking
up
its
keycode
in
the
xmodmap
i
found
the
entry
modeswitch
which
doesnt
ring
any
bell
the
entries
for
the
keys
i
cannot
use
seem
to
be
correct
example
keycode
xx
ssharp
questn
backslash
the
first
entries
i
can
even
get
at
the
first
one
is
the
unmodified
key
and
the
second
is
the
key
with
shift
but
what
is
the
my
guess
is
that
it
should
be
the
key
with
altgr
but
it
isnt
if
anybody
has
run
into
similar
problems
and
knows
how

xv
has
finally
escaped
it
really
bums
me
out
that
xv
went
shareware
xv
is
shareware
for
personal
use
only
you
may
use
xv
for
your
own
what
does
this
mean
anyway
can
i
sit
in
a
company
and
look
at
pictures
off
the
net
in
my
spare
time
amusement
and
if
you
find
it
nifty
useful
generally
cool
or
of
some
value
to
you
your
nondeductable
donation
would
be
greatly
appreciated
is
the
suggested
donation
though
of
course
larger
donations
are
quite
welcome
folks
who
donate
or
more
can
receive
a
real
nice
bound
copy
of
the
xv
manual
for
no
extra
charge
commercial
government
and
institutional
users
must
register
their
copies
of
xv
for
the
exceedingly
reasonable
price
of
just
per
workstationx
terminal
site
licenses
are
available
for
those
who
wish
to
run
xv
on
a
large
number
of
machines
contact
the
author
for
more
details
now
since
universities
are
institutions
right
doesnt
this
mean
that
most
everyone
in
the
world
is
affected
by
this
i
dont
believe
there
are
that
many
running
x
windows
at
home
yet
relatively
speaking
can
the
author
legally
sell
xv
xv
uses
tiff
and
jpeg
code
developed
by
others
did
the
author
get
permission
to
sell
these
works
did
the
author
also
get
permission
from
all
the
people
who
contributed
to
xv
to
sell
their
work
as
well
my
guess
is
that
now
nobody
is
going
to
want
to
help
the
author
maintain
the
code
anymore
now
that
xv
has
become
a
commercial
product
and
support
for
xv
will
begin
to
slide
downhill
if
this
is
the
case
then
thats
a

click
to
focus
vs
point
to
focus
i
am
having
the
problem
of
ensuring
pointtofocus
when
the
mouse
cursor
enters
a
window
in
my
application
im
using
interviews
but
that
may
not
matter
this
seems
to
be
a
generic
problem
in
x
for
example
i
use
openwindows
on
a
with
pointtofocus
set
and
that
generally
works
but
not
always
depending
on
what
was
going
on
in
some
window
when
i
move
the
cursor
from
one
shell
tool
window
to
another
or
so
it
seems
my
question
then
is
what
can
i
do
within
x
to
guarantee
pointto
focus
within
my
application

diagram
drawing
program
i
am
looking
for
a
program
to
draw
various
kinds
of
diagrams
on
my
linux
system
it
must
be
free
it
must
run
on
standard
monochrome
x
with
a
small
screen
size
no
motifopenlook
etc
it
must
compile
under
linux
with
gccg
most
generic
unix
software
works
ok
it
must
produce
postscript
files
that
i
can
include
into
latex
documents
with
dvips
or
just
tell
me
another
free
program
that
converts
one
of
the
supported
formats
to
ps
it
must
produce
drawings
that
are
larger
than
the

size
scrollable
i
know
of
several
such
programs
idraw
xfig
tgif
i
have
no
experience
with
any
of
them
features
i
would
like
in
the
programs
are
ability
to
draw
circles
arcs
straight
lines
boxes
and
arrows
support
for
both
dashed
and
solid
line
styles
for
all
of
these
objects
support
for
texts
in
any
size
ability
to
movecopyresizerotate
any
part
of
the
drawing
ability
to
turn
any
part
of
the
drawing
into
a
library
component
eg
a
transistor
symbol
composed
of
three
lines
an
arrow
and
a
circle
any
aid
numeric
coordinates
screen
grid
to
align
parts
of
the
drawing
less
essential
but
in
fact
very
handy
preservation
of
connection
if
i
move
one
part
of
the
drawing
the
lines
that
connect
that
part
to
the
rest
of
the
drawing
stay
connected
ideally
i
want
the
tool
so
general
and
flexible
that
it
is
comfortable
to
draw
electronic
schematics
flow
charts
logic
diagrams
data
flow
diagrams
and
block

with
it
i
just
want
to
know
which
of
the
programs
offer
which
of
the
features
on

are
there

version
of
andrew
the
andrew
consortium
of
the
school
of
computer
science
at
carnegie
mellon
is
pleased
to
announce
auis
for
the
andrew
user
interface
system
version
our
cdrom
version
was
developed
for
aix
version
on
the
ibm
and
many
other
platforms
to
accomodate
aix
version
we
have
created
a
patch
to
the
sources
the
patch
and
accompanying
instructions
for
its
application
can
be
retrieved
at
no
charge
via
anonymousftp
from
the
internet
host
emsworthandrewcmuedu
in

below
the

system
can
be
ordered
from
us
as
a
cdrom
or
ftped
from
the
same
host
note
that
this
patch
adds
no
additional
functionality
but
simply
allows
auis
to
compile
under
the
andrew
user
interface
system
auis
is
a
comprehensive
environment
on
top
of
windows
in
which
you
can
create
use
and
mail
multimedia
applications
and
documents
a
major
advantage
of
auis
is
the
capability
to
recursively
embed
objects
thus
one
can
edit
text
that
not
only
contains
multiple
fonts
indentation
and
other
typography
but
also
contains
embedded
raster
images
spreadsheets
drawing
editors
equations
simple
animations
and
so
on
these
embedded
objects
can
themselves
contain
other
objects
including
text
auis
has
three
components
the
andrew
user
environment
is
an
integrated
and
extensible
set
of
applications
beginning
with
the
ez
text
editor
a
help
system
a
system
monitoring
tool
an
editorbased
shell
interface
and
other
editors
corresponding
to
the
various
available
types
of
objects
the
andrew
toolkit
atk
is
a
portable
objectoriented
userinterface
toolkit
that
provides
the
architecture
wherein
objects
can
be
embedded
in
oneanother
with
the
toolkit
programmers
can
create
new
objects
that
can
be
embedded
as
easily
as
those
that
come
with
the
system
the
andrew
message
system
ams
provides
a
multimedia
interface
to
mail
and
bulletinboards
ams
supports
several
mail
management
strategies
and

vs
configure
event
handling
repost
i
have
two
questions
well
probably
more
about
how
expose
configure
events
are
handled
i
have
an
appl
which
uses
window
to
draw
in
since
i
give
the
user
the
capability
of
scaling
and
zooming
as
well
as
allowing
the
window
to
be
resized
i
made
a
translation
table
for
the
expose
configure
events
the
expose
event
calls
my
redraw
method
while
the
configure
event
calls
my
rescale
method
the
rescale
method
invokes
a
fake
expose
event
actually
just
calls
the
redraw
w
an
appropriate
expose
struct
to
draw
the
data
quest
when
the
appl
is
compiledlinked
w
running
in
either
or
env
i
get
multiple
redraws
when
the
window
gets
uncovered
or
the
size
is
changed
i
assume
im
getting
cascading
events
is
that
right
any
suggestions
as
to
how
to
handletrap
events
in
a
better
way
quest
when

getting
openbugs

hello
the

says
it
all
i
need
a
list
of
the
bugs
for

thanks
neal
subject
xmtextfield
truncation
with
lang
bug
i
have
found
a
situation
which
i
think
is
a
bug
in
x
or
motif
but
im
hoping
is
really
just
a
mistake
on
my
part
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
problem
i
am
using
an
xmtextfield
and
setting
its
xmnvalue
to
a
hardcoded
text
string
ascii
or
kanji
either
via
xtsetvalues
or
xmtextsetstring
the
problem
is
that
when
the
xmtextfield
is
displayed
the
text
is
getting
truncated
depending
on
the
setting
of
the
environment
variables
lang
more
specifically
lcall
when
they
are
set
to
japanese
the
text
gets
truncated
when
they
are
set
to
english
everything
works
fine
i
am
taking
the
default
for
xmncolumns
please
note
that
hardcoding
of
text
is
not
done
in
my
actual
application
just
in
my
sample
code
to
make
things
easier
i
am
running
motif
via
my
test
program
is
set
up
to
handle
bit
kanji
characters
i
have
remembered
to
do
xtsetlanguageproc
prior
to
my
mrminitialize
and
my
font
resources
are
set
to
japanese
fonts
dont
know
if
this
matters
but
my
dialog
box
and
textfield
is
initially
created
with
uil
the
problem
does
not
happen
with
xmtext
unfortunately
substituting
xmtextfields
with
xmtexts
in
my
application
is
not
an
acceptable
alternative
way
too
much
code
to
be
modified
while
in
beta
i
have
a
small
test
program
which
illustrates
the
problem
if
anyone
wants
it
my
best
guess
is
that
either
the
x
code
or
motif
is
not
properly
allocating
memory
for
japanese
but
since
i
dont
have
the
source
to
look
at
it
is
just
a
guess
please
let
me
know
if
this
sounds
familiar
or
if
you
have
a
suggestion
or
if
you
want

the

waiting
for
the

to
respond
to
its
positioning
request
the
windowmanager
is
not
responding
because
it
thinks
the
window
is
already
in
the
right
place
exactly
why
the
two
components
get
into
this
sulk
is
unclear
to
me
all
information
greatly
received
this
problem
is
caused
by
a
bad
interaction
between
the
way
olwm
reparents
windows
a
misfeature
of
the
x
protocol
and
a
bug
in
the
xt
intrinsics
the
intrinsics
bug
is
that
it
ignores
the
xy
position
given
in
reparentnotify
events
olwm
is
structured
in
such
a
way
that
when
a
window
is
popped
down
the
last
event
the
client
receives
is
a
reparentnotify
event
at
this
point
the
intrinsics
notion
of
the
shells
location
is
out
of
date
if
a
setvalues
is
done
using
the
same
xy
position
the
intrinsics
thinks
it
needs
to
move
the
shell
so
it
issues
a
configurewindow
request
to
move
it
there
however
a
misfeature
of
the
x
protocol
is
that
a
configurewindow
request
that
has
no
effect
will
generate
no
configurenotify
event
the
intrinsics
thus
waits
for
an
event
that
will
never
arrive
and
times
out
after
wmtimeout
has
expired
actually
things
are
somewhat
more
complex
because
the
request
is
redirected
to
the
window
manager
but
the
net
result
is
the
same
the
solution
is
for
the
intrinsics
to
note
the
xy
positioning
information
in
reparentnotify
events
this
has
been
implemented
and
is

at

big
improvement
x
x
this
code
tries
to
be
intelligent
in
the
way
it
works
this
means
there
x
are
tons
of
implicit
assumptions
about
the
environment
it
is
run
in
x
these
assumptions
are
all
valid
on
the
machines
i
use

in
my
x
environment
at
the
same
time
i
try
to
make
as
few
assumptions
as
possible
x
about
the

heres
a
list

all
the
more
tricky
ones

that
the

that

use

i
pass
a

if
need
be
but
does
it
x
know
what
to
do
with
a
cookie
eat
it
x
there
must
be
others
x
x
why
am
i
using
csh
to
run
the
remote
commands
simply
because
it
doesnt
x
interact
badly
with
rsh
and
hang
waiting
for
a
file
descriptor
to
x
be
closed
id
rather
use
zsh
or
bash
or
even

they
are

im
hoping
is
really
just
a
mistake
on
my
part
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
problem
i
am

xmtextfield
and
setting
its
xmnvalue
to
a
hardcoded
text
string
ascii
or
kanji
either
via
xtsetvalues
or
xmtextsetstring
the
problem
is
that
when
the
xmtextfield
is
displayed
the
text
is
getting
truncated
depending
on
the
setting
of
the
environment
variables
lang
more
specifically
lcall
when
they
are
set

the
text
gets
truncated
when
they
are
set
to
english
everything
works
fine
i
am
taking
the
default
for
xmncolumns
please
note
that
hardcoding
of
text
is
not
done
in
my
actual
application
just
in
my
sample

make
things
easier

i
have

to
do
xtsetlanguageproc
prior

and
my

resources
are
set
to
japanese
fonts
dont
know
if
this
matters
but
my
dialog
box
and
textfield
is
initially
created
with
uil
the
problem
does
not
happen
with
xmtext
unfortunately
substituting
xmtextfields
with
xmtexts
in
my
application
is
not
an
acceptable
alternative
way
too
much
code
to
be
modified
while
in
beta
i
have
a
small
test
program
which
illustrates
the
problem
if
anyone
wants
it
my
best
guess
is
that
either
the
x
code
or
motif
is
not
properly
allocating
memory
for
japanese
but
since
i
dont
have
the
source
to
look
at
it
is
just
a
guess
the
problem
was
that
textfield
was
improperly
walking
the
string
it
used
the
character
count
instead
of
the
byte
count

think
this

a

of
how
to

you
can
always
write
another

that
interprets
the

as
you
like
you
can
look
at
the
implementation
of

from

im
working

we
are
creating
a

rendering
it
in

by
applying
it
to
the

of

the
following

segment
almost
works
if
the

width
is
an
even
multiple
of
if
it
is
not
an
even
multiple
it
skews
the
pattern
towards
the
right
another
problem
whether
it
is
an
even
multiple
of
or
not
is
a

they

basically
the

are

tcltkinterviews

suit
so
far
ive
drawn
the
following
conclusions
the
builder
for
interviews
is
not
very
mature
bad
docs
teleuse
is
very
expensive
and
uses
a
proprietary
toolkit
uimx
xdesigner
seem
about
the

even
though
xdesigner
does
not
have
a

ill
by

re
table
widget
causing
trouble
with
xtquerygeometry
i
just
got
a
bug
report
and
a
fix
for
this
exact
problem
from
fisheriscpbellcorecom
greg
fisher
the
most
serious
problem
i
have
identified
has
not
been
incorporated
this
problem
occurs
when
the
table
widgets
geometrymanager
is
invoked
by
a
child
this
will
work
correctly
if
the
table
widgets
parent
complies
with
the
xt
protocols
however
if
they
do
not
as
is
the
case
for
some
motif
widgets
and
they
ignore
xtcwqueryonly
then
the
sizing
will
be
incorrect
in
order
to
see
this
problem
the
following
events
must
happen
a
child
of
the
table
widget
must
request
a
new
size
the
table
widget
must
query
its
parent
for
a
new
size
having
set
xtcwqueryonly
the
parent
must
ignore
the
xtcwqueryonly
bit
and
resize
the
table
widget
as
part
of
the
resize
xmptableforgetproposedlayout
is
called
this
will
set
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
to
zero
the
table
will
continue
setting
up
the
new
size
working
under
the
assumption
that
it
is
working
with
a
proposed
and
not
actual
layout
at
the
end
it
will
call
xmptablesaveproposedlayout
this
will
save
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
and
restore
their
values
from
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
however
these
have
already
been
set
to
zero
since
the
table
widget
has
already
been
resized
it
will
not
need
a
second
resize
next
another
widget
managed
by
some
ancestor
of
the
table
is
resized
this
results
in
the
parent
of
the
table
requesting
the
tables
preferred
size
since
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
are
zero
this
will
return
as
the
preferred
size
the
parent
is
very
likely
to
grant
this
request
resulting
in
a
loss
of
the
whole
table
from
the
display

isolated
the
problem

precisely
correct

hello
our

in
a

we
are
trying
to
use
action

by
assigning

in

in
a

the

we
make
are
included
below
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
if
we
could
assign
the
translation
table
to
a
class
of
widgets
rather
than
individual
widget
instantiations
and
also
accomplish
it
for
multiple
applications
if
someone
could
describe
how
do
this

that

must
have
if
one
machine
running

is
supporting
multiple

and
we
require
adequate

anyone
have
any
ideas
i
expect
the
limiting
factor
will
be
your
server
machine
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
example
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughly
people
using
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
boxes
novell
file
servers
and
each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
powerful
server
machine
because
of
the
significant
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
is
costly
and
the
bandwidth
limited
thats
why
my
interest
lies
in
seeing
if
such
a
link
can
be
used
and
see
what
traffic
goes
through
it
since
i
dont
think
tom
always
gets
time
to
read
this
group
ill
take
the
liberty
of
responding
to
some
of
this
if
you
really
want
tom
to
reply
you
should
send
mail
to
supportqdeckcom
a
line
is
certainly
going
to
restrict
you
far
more
than
the
ethernet
that
we
typically
run
how
restrictive
it
will
be
depends
on
what
you
run
and
how
you
run
it
i
would
think
that
a
couple
of
instances
of
some
really
nasty
program
like
smoking
clover
would
make
the
link
useless
for
anyone
else
on
the
other
hand
probably
xclocks
quietly
updating
every
seconds
or
so
wouldnt
impact
it
too
much
in
the
real
world
you
will
be
somewhere
in
between
these
two
extremes
going
by
the
way
i
personally
use
x
on
a
daily
basis
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
to
share
that
link
with
more
than
other
people
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
has
anyone
at
your
centre
monitored
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
running
any
standard
mswindows
programs
like
word
what
sort
of
packets
go
blazing
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
or
what
is
the
average
traffic
flow
going
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peaks
and
then
many
low
points
our
corporate
wan
is
as
unique
as
any
other
the
usage
patterns
are
not
very
good
predictors
of
how
yours
will
behave
the
only
one
of
our
low
bandwidth
links
that
normally
get
used
in
this
way
is
a
link
to
ireland
that
they
often
use
to
run
a
dos
text
based
client
end
of
a

database
remotely
from
the
dvx
machine
behind
me
since
the

end
is
or
was
always
at

california
it
is
faster
to
remotely
run
the
client
via
desqview
x
and
have
a
short
hop
to
the

than
running
the
client
locally
and
having
a
long
hop
to
the

as
i
warned

you

pattern
will

link
running
word
for

remotely
is
going
to
itself
be
very
usage
dependent
lets
break
it
into
pieces
and
look
at
it
tracking
the
mouse
pointer
is
easy
and
efficient
to
translate
from
windows
calls
into
x
popping
up
a
menu
is
a
little
more
involved
and
will
generate
some
traffic
restoring
the
screen
that
was
covered
by
that
menu
may
be
easy
and
may
not
be
does
the
server
that
its
displaying
on
have
backing
store
if
so
and
the
server
had
enough
memory
the
display
can
be
updated
locally
and
will
generate
little
network
traffic
if
no
backing
store
then
what
was
being
covered
up
if
it
was
a
solid
colored
rectangle
of
space
we
can
tell
your
xserver
to
draw
that
quite
easily
if
it
was
a
full
color
backdrop
of
ren
stimpy
we
may
have
to
send
it
back
to
the
x
server
bit
by
bit
dvx
will
do
its
level
best
to
only
redraw
that
small
area
but
in
some
unusual
cases
the
entire
screen
may
need
to
be
repainted

thats

that
has

worst
possible
case
youre
looking
at
about

in

it
would
never
be
this
bad
since
the

will
always
have
parts
that
will
be
tranlatable
into
higher
level
x
calls
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
apps
are
all
doing
network
things
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
things
i
vision
using
ms
windows
and
other
windows
applications
over
the
network
were
the
processes
are
running
on
the
server
and
all
i
am
getting
are
the

i
am
wondering
how
good
is
the
x
and
subsequently
dvx
protocol
in
transferring
these
images
with
xcalls
and
displaying
them
on
a
clients
machine
x
was
designed
from
the
ground
up
to
be
efficient
across
a
network
its
pretty
good
for
this
x
programs
are
best
dos
text
programs
are
almost
as
good
since
we
conert
them
to
x
easily
something
like
winx
is
a
hybrid
we
intercept
the
calls
windows
makes
to
its
graphics
driver
mouse
driver
keyboard
driver
and
convert
them
to
x
the

windows
is
making
are

way
designed

on
a
packet
switched
network
we
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
to
convert
them
to
the
highes
level
xlib
calls
we
can
but
we
are
somewhat
limited
because
we

i

system
it
must
be
free
it
must
run
on
standard
monochrome
x
with
a
small
screen
size
no

etc
it
must
compile
under

with

most
generic
unix
software
works
ok
it
must
produce
postscript

that
i
can
include
into

with
dvips
or
just
tell
me
another
free
program
that
converts
one
of

supported

it
must
produce
drawings
that
are
larger

scrollable
i
know
of
several
such
programs
idraw
xfig
tgif
i
have
no
experience
with
any
of
them
features
i
would
like
in
the
programs
are
ability
to
draw
circles
arcs
straight
lines
boxes
and
arrows
support
for
both
dashed

solid

styles
for
all

turn
any
part

the
drawing
into
a
library
component
eg
a
transistor
symbol
composed
of
three
lines
an
arrow
and
a
circle
any
aid
numeric
coordinates
screen
grid
to
align
parts
of

less
essential
but
in

very
handy
preservation
of
connection
if
i
move
one
part
of
the
drawing
the
lines
that
connect
that
part
to
the
rest
of
the
drawing
stay
connected
ideally
i
want
the
tool
so
general
and
flexible
that
it
is
comfortable
to
draw
electronic
schematics
flow
charts
logic
diagrams
data
flow
diagrams
and
block

with

i
just
want
to
know
which
of

offer
which
of

on

are
there
any

are
any
of
the

known

on

with
monochrome
x
in
the
list
you
mentioned
tgif
handles
everything
except
rotation
and
any
size
text
it
only
supports
degrees
rotation
currently
it
supports
standard
font
sizes
however
it
allows
arbitrary
scaling
of
the
entire
drawing
effectively
it
allows
any
font
sizes
but
you
can
only
have
different
sizes
per
drawing
tgif
takes
up
compiled
with
o
option
on

i
was
told
that
it
compiles
under
linux
but
i
havent

it

xdm
xkernel
and
olwm
greetings
we
have
a
network
of
sun
workstations
running
sunos
and
openwindows
of
these
are
sun
that
we
have
modified
to
run
seth
robertsons
xkernel
image
effectively
turning
them
into
xterminals
we
use
xdm
to
manage
the
displays
when
we
had
xkernel
machines
things
worked
fine
but
when
we
installed
more
last
weekend
we
appear
to
have
found
a
weakness
with
clients
to
sparc
the
sparc
window
manager
is
eventually
getting
munged
let
me
try
to
be
precise
the
user
sitting
at
the
machine
that
does
all
the
actual
processing
for
these
xterminals
is
having
control
of
his
keyboard
and
screen
yanked
away
when
this
was
the
department
chair
it
was
kind
of
cute
we
poked
at
xdm
for
a
few
days
and
are
satisfied
that
it
is
not
at
fault
our
current
theory
is
that
olwm
the
sun
version
was
not
meant
for
running
multiple
copies
on
one
machine
which
is
what
happens
the
console
user
runs
olwm
and
every
xterminal
logged
in
has
olwm
running
on
the
xterminal
server
has
anyone
had
any
prior
experience
with
this
sort
of
behavior
can
anyone
shoot
obvious
holes
in
this
theory
how
about
obvious
gimmes
and
of
course
any
ideas
on
how
to
solve
it
any
ideas
are
greatly

its

at

another
is
to

the

the

our
alternative
is
that

of
having

run

it
runs
the

most

have

have

also
specify
a

for

like
drawpointxycolor
or
or
with

i
have
to
do
something

xsetforegroundcurrentcolor
xdrawpointdwxy
why
split
this

why

associate

with
the
display
it

being
drawn
on
for
flexibility
anyway
what
you
say
is
not
really
true
the
color
information
is
associated
with
a
graphicscontext
not
with
a
display
and
the
gc
is
a
parameter
to
the
drawing
routines
so
if
you
need
to
fast
switch
between
green
dotted
lines
and
blue
ones
of
width
you
can
make
gcs
for
those
cases
and
then
simply
do
for
this
effect
this
is
eventually
more
complicated
to
do
for
the
programmer
but
also
much
more
efficient
and
flexible
you
would
not
include
all
the
other
parameters
like
line
pattern
with
cap
and
joinstyle
drawmode
and
so
on
in
every
drawing
call
so
why
do
it
for
color
btw
stay
away
from
xdrawpoint
if
you
dont
really
need
it

greetings
i
am
developing
an
application
that
allows
a
user
to
interactively
createeditview
a
visual
model
ie
topology
of
their
network
and
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
knew
of
any
builder
tools
that
exist
to
simplify
this
task
in
the
past
i
have
used
visual
edges
uimx
product
to
develop
other
guis
so
i
am
familiar
with
uimss
in
general
the
topology
will
support
objects
and
connecting
links
once
the
topology
is
created
i
want
to
provide
the
user
with
capabilities
to
support
grouping
zooming
etc
i
am
looking
for
some
form
of
a
higher
abstraction
other
than
x
drawing
routines
to
accomplish
this
specifically
the
zooming
and
grouping
aspects
may
prove
difficult
and
certainly
time
consuming
if
i
have
to
roll
my
own
suggestions

you

does
exactly
what
you
want

the

is
supported

other

fine
the

suggests
it
might
be
a
problem
with

but
isnt
willing
to
hack
around

it
himself
but
i

zero

anyone

we
are
adding
a
motif
wrapper
to
a
family
of
data
display
programs
these
programs
are
each
written
as
a
main
loop
with
these
steps
use
semop
to
check
a
semaphore
and
if
true
access
new
data
otherwise
block
new
data
comes
quite
often
use
msgop
to
check
for
messages
and
if
true
read
them
otherwise
continue
messages
are
user
commands
and
not
often
update
the
display
according
to
latest
data
and
messages
we
typically
have
several
of
these
running
in
windows
plus
a
data
producer
serving
some
device
and
setting
the
flag
everyone
blocking
makes
sure
the

server
gets
to
run

that

during
idle

we
can
openup
our
existing
main
loop
and
call
it
as
a

the
problem
is
our
blocking
until
new

is
no
longer
appropriate
neither
is
letting
the

freerun
because
others
are
hurt
the

i
have
done
this
before
but
im
not
sure
i
used
the
best
approach
although
i
tried
several
methods
you
have
to
run
up
the
window
heirarchy
using
xquerytree
until
you
get
to
the
root
window
now
this
is
not
so
simple
because
some
window
managers
slap
a
window
over
the
root
window
that
is
the
same
size
as
the
root
window
so
be
sure
to
take
that
into
account
for
further
calculations
calculate
the
position
and
widthheight
offsets
for
each
window
using
xgetgeometry
be
sure
to
take
the
borderwidth
into
consideration
remember
a
windows
borderwidth
is
on
the
outside
of
a
window
so
the
windows
xywidthheight
must
be
adjusted
accordingly
all
of
this
should
give
you
pretty
good
numbers
for
how
much
space
the
windowmanager
is
using
now
to
place
the
new
window
you
have
to
use
the
same
numbers
to
calculate
where
you
want
to
place
it
because
the
windowmanager
will
reparent
it
on
the
outside
of
where
you
place
your
window
if
i
remember
correctly
disclaimer
all
of
this
is
from
memory
and
i
no
longer
have
the
code
but
i
did
get
it
working
under
several
window
managers
correctly
feel
free
to
call
or
email
for
further

x
server
only
on
sun
i
have
been
using
a
hds
xterminal
and
really
like
it
what
is
really
powerful
is
that
it
can
run
the
x
server
without
running
a
window
manager
one
can
then
run
a
special
client
x
program
called
a
window
manager
either
run
motif
or
openlook
from
its
own
firmware
limiting
the
network
traffic
but
having
no
home
or
run
motif
or
openlook
from
some
home
place
like
a
sparc
or
vms
this
is
powerful
especially
since
i
can
exit
one
window
manager
without
killing
windows
and
then
start
up
another
manager
some
of
my
vms
tools
need
special
metamouse
combos
that
work
in
one
manager
and
not
the
other
well
the
question
is
on
a
sparcstation
running
openlook
does
anyone
know
how
to
break
apart
olwm
from
the
olwmslave
program
basically
i
want
to
run
only
the
server
and
go
somewhere
else
to
run
the
window
manager
please
respond
my
email
as
well
as
posting

of
the

i
use
it
all
day
every
day
maintaining
our
ftp
site
and
answering
mail
via
supportqdeckcom
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
in
the
last
few
months
ive
never
had
my
machine
go
down
due
to
any
sort
of
tcpip
network
manager
instability
of
course
ive
crashed
my
machine
quite
a
few
times
on
purpose
during
beta
testing
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
tcpip
portion
is
quite
stable
however
keep
in
mind
that
dvx
and
the
network
managers
are
only
going
to
be
as
stable
as
the
software
they
sit
on
top
of
so
if
your
underlying
network
kernel
is
flakey
you
cant
expect
dvx
to
be
terribly
stable
how
does
it
send
the
information
from
a
ms
windows
app
over
the
protocol
does
it
just
draw
everything
as
graphics
into
one
window
or
does
it
use
multiple
windows
and
essentially
work
more
cleverly
it
just
goes
as
a
window
that
has
graphics
drawn
into
it
to
vastly
oversimplify
what
goes
on
we
just
take
the
windows
graphics
api
calls
and
translate
them
directly
to
xprotocol
unfortunately
windows
was
not
really
written
to
be
networkaware
so
sometimes
we
see
a
speed
penalty
when
an
app
does
something
stupid
like
sending
a
big
white
bitmap
to
erase
something
rather
than
just
drawing
a
white
box
fortunately
that
sort
of
thing
is
rare
if
i
want
to
run
ms
word
for
example
remotely
do
i
have
to
run
a
separate
copy
of
ms
windows
remotely
and
then
start
ms
word
from
that
or
can
ms
word
be
started
remotely
on
its
own
you
need
to
run
ms
windows
which
word
then
runs
inside
you
could
run
multiple
windows
programs
within
the
one
winx
window
and
windows
has
ways
to
automagically
start
winapps
when
you
start
windows
so
in
practice
its
not
really
a
major
problem
i
have
my
system
set
up
so
that
i
can
run
winx
which
automatically
starts
word
fullscreen
for
windows
so
i
never

i
recently
corrected
the

changing

to

i
determined
that
my

was

dividing
by

however

this

my

i
believe
that

is
grabbing
the

with
these

displaying
it

i
have
only

the
results
are
inaccurate
i
do

not

i

this

the

this
never

happen

explicitly
request

yres
this
is
true
of
both
the
scaleable

bitmapped

for
instance
the

xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
speedo
font
the
command
xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
or
a
font
depending
on
my
font
path
despite
the
fact
that
x
knows
my
display
is
dpi
and
that
it
can
generate
an
font
for
me
unless
i
my

x
appears

a
stupid

is
this
a
bug
is
it
a
feature
if
so
why
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
get
around
this
problem
people
have
suggested
that
i
lie
about
my
resolution
and
specify
a
single
font
path
or
not
both
this
would
at
least
make

i

hi

bear
with

two

i
wrote
a

application
for
fast
animation
of
raster
files
with
sunview
becoming
rapidly
obselete
ive
finally
decided
to
rewrite
everything
from
scratch
in
xview
i
put
together
a
quick
test
and
ive
found
that
xputimage
is
considerably
slower
factor
of
on
average
than
the
sunview
command
pwrop
which
moves
image
data
from
memory
pixrects
to
a
canvas
this
was
on
a
sparc
ipx
it
seems
that
the
x
protocol
communication
is
slowing
things
down
or
xputimage
is
inefficientor
both
my
question
is
what
is
the
fastest
way
in
to
dump
plane
image
data
to
a

can
i
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
client
is
running
on

as

am
i
stuck
with
xputimage
in
which
case
i
might
as
well
give
up
now
all

the
fastest
way
is
to
use
an
x
server
with
shared
memory
extension
it
uses
shared
memory
if
it
is
a
local
x
server
hence
images
dont
have
to
be
duplicated
and
defaults
to
the
regular

routines
if

the

is

on
the
individual
toolkits
heres
a
brief
summary
olit
was
atts
open
look
intrinsics
toolkit
for
the
x
window
system
it
used
a
widget
set
and
was
probably
the
easiest
for
people
who
were
already
programmers
to
learn
you
could
buy
the
source
from
att
although
you
didnt
get
the
same
version
tht
sun
ship
sun
includes
the
olit
library
in
openwindows
qv
it
is
also
often
included
in
system
v
release
it
was
written
in
c
the
release
of
olit
in
openwindows
was
olit
olit
support
passed
to
usl
then
a
division
of
att
now
owned
by
novell
who
replaced
it
with
moolit
qv
note
that
because
of
the
nature
of
xt
subclassing
you
will
probably
want
or
need
olit
source
in
order
to
develop
a
large
application
or
anything
else
that
uses
subclasses
see
the
proceedings
of
the
x
technical
conference
xview
is
suns
toolkit
for
written
in
c
xview
is
similar
in
programmer
interface
to
sunview
theres
even
a
shell
script
to
help
migrate
source
code
from
sunview
to
xview
xview
is
often
said
to
be
the
easiest
toolkit
to
learn
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
x
windows
the
xview
toolkit
is
included
in
openwindows
and
full
source
is
available
by
anonymous
ftp
from
exportlcsmitedu
and
elsewhere
the
current
version
of
xview
from
sun
is
despite
rumours
to
the
contrary
some
even
from
within
sun
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
about
to
be
dropped
by
sun
xview
will
be
included
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
unlike
news
on
the
other
hand
the
xview
toolkit
is
not
likely
to
receive
as
much
attention
from
sun
in
the
future
as
olit
the
news
toolkit
tnt
was
an
objectoriented
programming
system
based
on
the
postscript
language
and
news
tnt
implements
many
of
the
open
look
interface
components
required
to
build
the
user
interface
of
an
application
its
currently
included
in
openwindows
the
current
version
of
tnt
from
sun
is
release
contains
some
incompatibilities
with
tnt
and
tnt
but
sun
are
committed
to
supporting
the
api
at
least
until
they
stop
news
support
some
time
later
this
year
and
replace
it
with
display
postscript
wail
you
might
ask
what
is
committed
to
means
in
this
context
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
it
means
absolutely
nothing
sun
currently
asserts
that
it
is
committed
to
olit
however
the
c
user
interface
toolkit
uit
consists
of
an
objectoriented
c
class
library
layered
on
top
of
xview
and
a
tool
to
generate
code
from
devguide
gil
files
the
uit
also
includes
features
that
simplify
event
management
and
the
use
of
postscript
and
color
it
is
said
to
be
compatible
with
openwindows
and
and
presumably
since
the
release
mentions
that
it
works
on
solaris
uit
is
not
an
official
sunsupported
product
but
an
ongoing
project
of
various
people
within
sun
it
can
be
found
on

motif
is
an
alternative
graphical
user
interface
that
is
being
developed
by

it
has
a
look

of
microsoft

the

there
are
no
non

available
although
the
motif
source
is
sold
reasonably
cheaply
by
osf
although
motif
is
currently
available
on
more
platforms
than
openwindows
the
open

is
almost
certainly
used
on
many
more

what
about
that
display
postscript
thing
sun
and
adobe
have
agreed
that
sun
will
include
the
dps
extension
to
x
in
the
next
release
of
openwindows
dps
is
essentially
a
badly
designed
hack
on
top
of
a
slow
level
postscript
interpreter
intended
to
give
a
very
small
subset
of
the
functionality
of
news
whilst
simultaneously
being
harder
to
use
as
i
understand
it
the
only
real
advantage
it
has
over
news
is
that
the
manual
is
much
smaller
being
generally
less
complete
dps
is
also
available
on
more
kinds
of
machine
performance
on
our
is
not
suitable
for
interactive
work
what
it
will
be
like
on
the
sparcstation
remains
to
be
seen
note
that
whereas
xnews
fonts
are
shared
by
both
subsystems
the
dps
extension
to
x
does
not
make
type
postscript
fonts
available
to
ordinary
programs
it
is
not
like
atm
on
a
pc
in
this
regard
there
is
at
least
one
thirdparty
version
which
does
make
fonts
available

a

responsible
for
deciding
how
to
lay
out
windows
on

for
managing

olwm
is
the
standard
open

its
included
with
all
of
the
openwindows
qv
implementations
and
you
can
also
get
the

olvwm
is
a
version
of

that

name
it
shows
a
little
map
on

area
represented
by
a
little
rectangle
you
can
move
around
by

you
wont
be

and
you
probably
wont
see
the

some

use

if
you
use

youll
want
to
use

get

combines
sunview
news
postscript
and
this
means
that
it
can
run

compiled

unfortunately
it
means
that
some
openwindows

need
either
news

and
thus
wont

this

getting

what

do
i
need
to
know
about

and
xsessionrc
the
first
time
you
run
openwindows
a
xinitrc
file
will
be
created
in
your
login
directory
home
if
it
already
exists
you
might
have
to
edit
it
somewhat
its
simplest
to
move
it
and
any
other
old
files
you
have
to
another
directory
and
then
merge
the
old
and
new
files
if
your
site
uses
xdm
you
should
use
xsession
instead
of
xinitrc
since
xdm
doesnt
look
at
your
xinitrc
file
openwininit
openwinmenu
and
openwinsys
these
are
optional
files
you
can
create
in
your
home
directory
depending
on
which
version
of

you
use
look
in
openwinhomelib
normally
usropenwinlib
for
these
files
without

copy
any
you
want
to
change
you
may
need
to
edit
your
xinitrc
to
get
them
recognized
if
you
are
not
on
an

terminal
you
will
want
to
run
a
console
window
such
as
cmdtool
c
shelltool
c
xterm
c
or
chuck
muscianos
contool
program
so
that
system
output
will
be
directed
there
instead
of
writing
over
your
screen
note
that
openwinsys
is
not
executed
unless
you
edit
xinitrc
xdefaults
you
can
put
x
windows
resource
specifications
in
here
in
particular
it
is
a
good
idea
to
include
at
least
openwindowsfocuslenience
true

these
allow
nonicccmcompliant

to
receive

they

that
runs
when
you

actually
xnews

this
is
documented
in

programming
manual
near
the
back
the
most
useful
thing
to
put
here
is
postscript
code
to
change
the
keyboard
repeat
rate
although
you
must
be
very
careful
since
a
syntax
error
in
the
postscript
means
that
xnews
will
either
not
start
up
at
all
or
will
get
broken
in
strange
ways
the
news
manual
gives
code
that
is
both
incorrect
and
insufficient
warning

heres
what
homestartupps
should
look
like
if
you
want
a

of
about
a
third
of
a
second
microseconds
and
a
repeat
rate
of
twenty
or
so
keys
per
second
microseconds
between
repeats
for
openwindows
youll
have
to
experiment
a
bit
because
the
repeattime
is
the
delay
between
keys
sent
and
thus
doesnt
include
the
time
to
process
each
key
which
is
probably
higher
on
my
than
on

are
various
ways
including

if
youre
using

on

probably
the
best
you
can
do
short
of
upgrading

code
this

only
to

use

the

crashes

the

hangs
or
something
this
was
a
bug
related
to
some

only
the
only
workround
was
to
use
some
other

dump
program
such

xwd
xv
or

why
have
some
of
my
function
keys
stopped
working
keys
and
changed
from

to
and
respectively
in
openwindows
applications
must
be
recompiled
or
you
might
be
able
to
use
xmodmap
or
the
public

xkeycaps
program
to
change
your
keyboard
layout
back
again

type

that

not

these
notes
apply
to

although
you
could
also
the
do

sort

thing
with

install
the

in
you
can
intermix
openwindows
and
or
theyre
all
compatible
in
this
respect
put
the
binaries
in
for
example
put
last
in
your
path
so
that
you
get
openwindows
versions
of
programs
instead
of
ones
where
appropriate
although
this
is
a
matter
of
preference
in
any
event
put
the
openwindows
bin
directory
first
see
the
preceding
item
for
more
details
on
that
if
you
have
bin
or
usrbin
theyre
the
same
directory
on
sunos
earlier
in
your
path
than
openwinhomebinxview
youll
get
sunview
programs
instead
of
openwindows
ones
set
ldlibrarypath
so
that
usropenwinlib
is
last
after
the
library
directory
this
doesnt
matter
with
openwindows
but
with
older
versions
youll
get
error
messages
from

if
you
dont
do
this
the

are

your

be
patched
look
in
openwinhomelibospatches
and
install
the
patch
why
doesnt
answerbook
run
for
me
you
must
be
running
openwindows
to
use
answerbook
it
wont
run
under
on
an
x
terminal
or
on
anything
else
because
it
uses
news
to
draw
the
postscript
text
and
pictures
if
you
are
using
openwindows
you
need
to
use
the
openwindows
compatible
navigator
its
called
on
the
answerbook
cdrom
if
all
answerbook
users
are
using
openwindows
you
can
replace
navigator
wih
altogether
rename
the
old
one
first
to
satisfy
your
sense
of
paranoia
the
binary
is
also
on
cdware
vol
note
that
the
data
files
are
in
postscript
so
you
can
look
at
them
with

why
is
the

disabled

it

many

file

sadly
true
but
use

and
its
fine
it
also
works
if
you
run

on
a

fixed

when

run
several
programs
the
colors
on

all
change
when
i
move
into
a
different

colormap
flashing
this
is
becasue
most
hardware
can
only
display
a
few
colors
at
a
time
however
you
can
minimise
the
effect
with
the
following
procedure
start
all
the
applications
with
colors
that
you
wish
to
reserve
run
cmapcompact
save
to
create
the
owcolors
file
put
the
line
cmapcompact
init
near
the
start
of
your
startup
file
xinitrc
exit
and
then
restart
the
window
system
cmapcompact
init
will
push
those
colors
owcolors
to
the
end
of
the
colormap
and
reserves
them
also
note
that
locks
the
colors
of
the
current

unlocks
them
this
is
described
in
the
olwm
manual
page
pageiew
uses
the

or
makes

note
that
there

it
doesnt
sem
to
have

and
has

how
do
i
set

panellistfont
takes
an
int
rownumber
and
an
xvopaque
fonthandle
panellistfonts
take
a
null
terminated
list
of
xvopaque
fonthandles
there
is
no
easy
way
to
make
an
entire
list
fixed
width
font
you
have
to
make
sure
that
you
always
specify
panellistfont
when
you
insert
a
new
row
into
that
list
or
write
a
convenience
function
insertrowlist
row
string
that
hides
the
nasty
bits
how
do
i
keep
an
xview
popup
window
displayed
after
a

is
pressed
in
the

callback
do
xvsetbutton
panelnotifystatus
xverror
null
this
will
keep
the

visible
you
might
also
need
to
investigate
the
menunotifystatus
attribute
how
do
i
make
an
xview

look
pressed
call

window

there
are
a
lot
of
window
managers
out
there
with
lots
of
different
features
and
abilities
the
choice
of
which
to
use
is
by
necessity
a
balancing
act
between
performance
and
useful
features
at
this
point
most
respondents
have
agreed
upon
twm
as
the
best
candidate
for
a
speedy
window
manager
a
couple
of
generic
tricks
you
can
try
to
soup
up
your
window
manger
is
turning
off
unnecessary
things
like
zooming
and
opaque
move
also
if
you
lay
out
your
windows
in
a
tiled
manner
you
reduce
the
amount
of
cpu
power
spent
in
raising
and
lowering
overlapping
windows

ive
found
that
a
good
font
for

is
aka
it
is
the
biggest

i
know
of
that
i
can
use
on
my

and
still
get

sidebyside
on

make
sure
that
your

is
a
proper
match
for
your
hardware
if
you
have
a
monochrome
monitor
use
a
monochrome
server
on
my
monochrome
sun
i
havent
noticed
much
difference
between
the
xsun
colour
server
and
xsunmono
however
it
was
pointed
out
to
me
that
xsunmono
is
about
smaller
and
therefore
should
contribute
to
less
paging

how
your
server
was
compiled
can
also
make
a
difference
jeff
law
lawschirfcsutahedu
advises
us
that
on
a
sun
system
x
should
be
compiled
with
gcc
version
or
with
the
unbundled
sun
compiler
you
can
expect
to
get
very
large
speedups
in
the
server
by
not
using
the
bundled
sunos
compiler
i
assume
that
similar
results
would
occur
if
you
used
one
of
the
other
highquality
commercial
compilers
on
the
market
locking
the
server
into
ram
has
anyone
tried
hacking
the
x
server
so
that
it
is
locked
into
ram
and
does
not
get
paged
eg
via
a
call
to
plock
does
this
help
performance
at
all
ive
had
one
inquiry
on
this
topic
and
a
few
pointers
to
the
plock
function
call
but
no
hard
evidence
from
someone
whos
tried
it
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
give
it

try

starting
your
server
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
if
you
start
up
a
lot
of
clients
in
your
xsession
or
whatever
sleep
for
a
second
or
two
after
launching
each
one
after
i
changed
my
xclients
script
to
do
this
logging
in
actually
took
less
time
we
have
a
heavily
loaded
system
without
much
core
though
this
sounds
crazy
but
i
have
confirmed
that
it
works
warner
losh
impsolbournecom
provided
me
with
a
good
explanation
of
why
this
works
which
i
have
summarized
here
when
you
start
up
an
x
server
it
takes
a
huge
amount
of
time
to
start
accepting
connections
a
lot
of
initialization
is
done
by
the
server
when
it
starts
this
process
touches
a
large
number
of
pages
any
other
process
running
at
the
same
time
would
fight
the
server
for
use
of
the
cpu
and
more
importantly
memory
if
you
put
a
sleep
in
there
you
give
the
server
a
chance
to
get
itself
sorted
out
before
the
clients
start
up
similarly
there
is
also
a
lot
of
initialization
whenever
an
x
client
program
starts
toolkits
registering
widgets
resources
being
fetched
programs
initializing
state
and
databases
and
so
forth
all
this
activity
is
typically
memory
intensive
once
this
initialization
is
done
the
process
has
reached
a
steady
state
the
memory
usage
typically
settles
down
to
using
only
a
few
pages
by
using
sleeps
to
stagger
the
launching
of
your
clients
in
your
xinitrc
you
avoid
them
fighting
each
other
for
your
workstations
limited
resources
this
is
most
definitely
a
your
mileage
may
vary
situation
as
there
are
so
many
variables
to
be
considered
available
ram
local
swap
space
load
average
number
of
users
on
your
system
which
clients
you
are
starting
etc
currently
in
my
xinitrc
i
have
a
situation
like
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
experimented
with
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
ive
even
tried
sleep
exec
startxclientsscript
and
then
in
startxclientsscript
i
had
sleep
exec
xclock
sleep
exec
xbiff
sleep
exec
xterm
sleep
exec
xterm
the
idea
with
this
last
one
was
to
make
sure
that
xinit
had
completely
finished
processing
my
xinitrc
and
had
settled
down
into
a
steady
state
before
the
sleep
expired
and
all
my
clients
were
launched
all
of
these
yielded
fairly
comparable
results
and
so
i
just
stuck
with
my
current
setup
for
its
simplicity
you
will
probably
have
to
experiment
a
bit
to
find
a
setup
which
suits
you
fonts
loading
fonts
takes
time
and
ram
if
you
minimize
the
number
of
fonts
your
applications
use
youll
get
speed
increases
in
loadup
time
one
simple
strategy
is
to
choose
a
small
number
of
fonts
one
small
one
large
one
roman
whatever
suits
you
and
configure
all
your
clients
or
at
least
all
your
heavily
used
clients
to
use
only
those
few
fonts
client
programs
should
start
up
quicker
if
their
font
is
already
loaded
into
the
server
this
will
also
conserve
server
resources
since
fewer
fonts
will
be
loaded
by
the
server

eg
my
main
xterm
font
is
so
i
also
have
twm
set
up
to
use
in
all
its
menus
and
icons
etc
twms
default
font
is
since
i
dont
normally
use
ive
eliminated
one
font
from
my
server
oliver
jones
ojroadrunnerpictelcom
keep
fonts
local
to
the
workstation
rather
than
loading
them
over
nfs
if
you
will
make
extensive
use
of
scalable
fonts
use
a
font
server
about
the
resources
file
keep
your
xresources
xdefaults
file
small
saves
ram
and
saves
on
server
startup
time
joe
english
joetrysteroartcom
one
suggestion
in
your
xdefaults
xresources
file
try
putting
only
the
minimum
number
of
resources
that
you
want
to
have
available
to
all
of
your
applications
for
example
reversevideo
true
then
separate
your
resources
into
individual
clientspecific
resource
files
for
example
homelibappdefaults
in
your
login
file
set
the
environment
variable
xuserfilesearchpath
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
homelibappdefaultsn
the
compwindowsx
frequently
asked
questions
faq
contains
an
excellent
explanation
of
how
these
environment
variables
work
ed
so
when
xterm
launches
it
loads
its
resources
from
appdefaultsxterm
xdvi
finds
them
in
appdefaultsxdvi
and
so
on
and
so
forth
note
that
not
all
clients
follow
the
same
xxxxx
resourcefile
naming
pattern
you
can
check
in
your
system
appdefaults
directory
often
to
find
the
proper
name
and
then
name
your
personal
resource
files
with
the
same
name
this
is
all
documented
in
the
xt
specification

kevin
is
willing
mail
his
setup
files
to
inquirers
this
method
of
organizing
your
personal
resources
has
the
following
benefits
easier
to
maintain
more
usable
fewer
resources
are
stored
in
the
x
server
in
the
resourcemanager
property
as
a
side
benefit
your
server
may
start
fractionally
quicker
since
it
doesnt
have
to
load
all
your
resources
applications
only
process
their
own
resources
never
have
to
sort
through
all
of
your
resources
to
find
the
ones
that
affect
them
it
also
has
drawbacks
the
application
that
you
are
interested
in
has
to
load
an
additional
file
every
time
it
starts
up
this
doesnt
seem
to
make
that
much
of
a
performance
difference
and
you
might
consider
this
a
huge
boon
to
usability
if
you
are
modifying
an
applications
resource
database
you
just
need
to
rerun
the
application
without
having
to
xrdb
again
xrdb
will
by
default
run
your
xdefaults
file
through
cpp
when
your
resources
are
split
out
into
multiple
resource
files
and
then
loaded
by
the
individual
client
programs
they
will
not
watch
out
for
this
i
had
c
style
comments
in
my
xdefaults
file
which
cpp
stripped
out
when
i
switched
to
this
method
of
distributed
resource
files
i
spent
several
frustrating
days
trying
to
figure
out
why
my
clients
were
not
finding
their
resources
xt
did
not
provide
any
error
message
when
it
encountered
the
c
style
comments
in
the
resource
files
it
simply
silently
aborted
processing
the
resource
file
the
loss
of
preprocessing
which
can
be
very
handy
eg
ifdef
color
is
enough
to
cause
some
people
to
dismiss
this
method
of
resource
management
you
may
also
run
into
some
clients
which
break
the
rules
for
example
neither
emacs
nor
xvt
will
find
their
resources
if
they
are
anywhere
other
than
in
xdefaults
when
starting
up
a
client
on
a
machine
that
does
not
share
files
with
the
machine
where
your
resources
are
stored
your
client
will
not
find
its
resources
loading
all
your
resources
into
the
server
will
guarantee
that
all
of
your
clients
will
always
find
their
resources
casey
leedom
caseygaussllnlgov
a
possible
compromise
suggestion
that
i
have
and
am
planning
on
trying
is
to
put
resources
for
all
my
heavily
used
clients
eg
xterm
into
my
xdefaults
file
and
to
use
the
separate
resources
files
method
for
clients
that
i
seldom
use
define
your
display
properly
client
programs
are
often
executed
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
in
that
situation
rather
than
setting
your
display
environment
variable
to
where
hostname
is
the
name
of
your
workstation
you
should
set
your
display
variable
to
or
by
doing
this
you
access
optimized
routines
that
know
that
the
server
is
on
the
same
machine
and
use
a
shared
memory
method
of
transferring
requests

how
to

i
dont

its
stock
mit
but
at

data
general

have

that
are
smart

to

sent
me
an

to

to
use

even
if

is
not
properly
set
i
dont
want
to
get
in
the
business
of
distributing
or
trying
to
juggle
nonmit
patches
and
so
have
elected
not
to
include
it
here
hopefully
mit
will
apply
this
minor
lines
patch
themselves
in
the

if
you
want
to
try
it
yourself
email
jody
ed
clients
if
you
only
have
a
few
megabytes
of
ram
then
you
should
think
carefully
about
the
number
of
programs
you
are
running
think
also
about
the
kind
of
programs
you
are
running
for
example
is
there
a
smaller
clock
program
than
xclock
unfortunately
i
havent
really
noticed
that
programs
advertise
how
large
they
are
so
the
onus
is
on
us
to
do
the
research
and
spread
the
word
suggestions
on
better
alternatives
to
the
some
of
the
standard
clients
eg
xclock
xterm
xbiff
are
welcome
ed
ive
received
some
contradictory
advice
from
people
on
the
subject
of
x
client
programs
some
advocate
the
use
of
programs
that
are
strictly
xlib
based
since
xt
xaw
and
other
toolkits
are
rather
large
others
warn
us
that
other
applications
which
you
are
using
may
have
already
loaded
up
one
or
more
of
these
shared
libraries
in
this
case
using
a
nonxt
for
example
client
program
may
actually
increase
the
amount
of
ram
consumed
the
upshot
of
all
this
seems
to
be
dont
mix
toolkits
that
is
try
and
use
just
athena
clients
or
just
xview
clients
or
just
motif
clients
etc
if
you
use
more
than
one
then
youre
dragging
in
more
than
one
toolkit
library
know
your
environment
and
think
carefully
about
which
client
programs
would
work
best
together
in
that
environment

dont
have
to
rename

resources
as
xvt
pretends
to
be
xterm
in
its
current
version
you
cannot
bind
keys
as
you
can
in
xterm
ive
heard
that
there
are
versions
of
xvt
with
this
feature
but
ive
not
found
any
yet
update
march
i
recently
had
a
few
email
conversations
with
brian
warkentin
brianwarkentineengsuncom
regarding
xvt
he
questions
whether
xvt
really
is
at
all
faster
than
xterm
for
instance
xvt
may
initialize
slightly
faster
but
compare
scrolling
speed
try
this
quickie
benchmark
bintime
dd
ifetctermcap
and
see
which
program
can
scroll
faster
also
while
xterm
may
be
slightly
larger
in
ram
requirements
we
dont
have
any
hard
numbers
here
does
anyone
else
shared
libraries
and
shared
text
segments
mean
that
xterms
paging
requirements
are
not
that
major
as
an
experiment
he
ripped
out
all
the
tek
stuff
from
xterm
but
it
made
little
difference
since
if
you
never
use
it
it
never
gets
brought
into
memory
so
here
we
stand
with
some
conflicting
reports
on
the
validity
of
xvt
over
xterm
in
summary
caveat
emptor
your
mileage
may
vary
if
you
can
provide
some
hard
data
id
like
to
see
it
specifically
how
much
ram
each
occupies
how
much
swap
each
needs

tuning
your

suggestions
on
how
you
can
tune
your
client
programs
to
work
faster
from
scott
barman
scottasdcom
comes
a
suggestion
regarding
motif
text
field
widgets
i
noticed
that
during
data
entry
into
motif
text
field
widgets
i
was
getting
a
slight
lag
in
response
to
some
keystrokes
particularly
the
initial
one
in
the
field
examining
the
what
was
going
on
with
xscope
i
found
it
it
seems
that
when
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
is
nonzero
and
the
focus
is
on
a
text
field
widget
or
even
just
a
text
widget
the
ibeam
cursor
will
blink
every
time
the
cursor
appears
or
disappears
in
those
widgets
the
widget
code
is
making
a
request
to
the
server
copyarea
the
user
can
stop
this
by
setting
the
resource
xmnblinkrate
to
it
is
not
noticeable
on
a
sparc
but
it
does
make
a
little
difference
on
a
slower
system
this
specific
suggestion
can
probably
be
applied
in
general
to
lots
of
areas
consider
your
heavily
used
clients
are
there
any
minor
embellishments
that
can
be
turned
off
and
thereby
save
on
server
requests
miscellaneous
suggestions
pretty
pictures
dont
use
large
bitmaps
gifs
etc
as
root
window
backgrounds
the
more
complicated
your
root
window
bitmap
the
slower
the
server
is
at
redrawing
your
screen
when
you
reposition
windows
or
redraw
etc
these
take
up
ram
and
cpu
power
i
work
on
a
sun
sparc
and
im
conscious
of
performance
issues
i
cant
comprehend
it
when
i
see
people
with
a
sun
running
xphoon
as
their
root
window
ill
let
someone
else
figure
out
how
much
ram
would
be
occupied
by
having
a
full
screen
root
image
on
a
colour
workstation
if
youre
anything
like
me
you
need
all
the
screen
real
estate
that
you
can
get
for
clients
and
so
rarely
see
the
root
window
anyway

to
speed
up
applications
that
youre
developing
there
are
tons
of
things
you
can
do
some
that
stick
out
for
motif
programs
dont
set
xmfontlist
resources
for
individual
buttons
labels
lists
et
al
use
the
defaultfontlist
or
labelfontlist
or
whatever
resource
of
the
highestlevel
manager
widget
again
stick
to
as
few
fonts
as
possible
better
yet
dont
use
motif
at
all
its
an
absolute
pig
dont
create
and
destroy
widgets
on
the
fly
try
to
reuse
them
this
will
avoid
many
problems
with
buggy
toolkits
too
use
a
line
width
of
in
gcs
on
some
servers
this
makes
a
huge
difference
compress
and
collapse
multiple
expose
events
this
can
make
the
difference
between
a
fast
application
and
a
completely
unusable
one

just
a
small
remark
i
once
heard
that
using
a
better
malloc
function
would
greatly
increase
performance
of
xt
based
applications
since
they
use
malloc
heavily
they
suggested
trying
out
the
gnuy
malloc
but
i
didnt
find
the
time
yet
i
did
some
tests
on
small
programs
just
doing
malloc
and
free
and
the
differences
were
indeed
very
noticeable
somewhat
times
faster
any
confirmation
on
this
from
anyone
ed
andre
beck
andrebeckirsinftudresdende
unnecessary
noexpose
events
most
people
use
xcopyareaxcopyplane
as
fastest
blit
routines
but
they
forget
to
reset
graphicsexposures
in
the
gc
used
for
the
blits
this
will
cause
a
noexpose
event
every
blit
that
in
most
cases
only
puts
load
onto
the
connection
and
forces
the
client
to
run
through
its
eventloop
again
and
again
thousands
of
xchangegc
requests
this
gfx
context
switching
is
also
seen
in
most
handcoded
xapps
where
only
one
or
few
gcs
are
created
and
then
heavily
changed
again
and
again
xt
uses
a
definitely
better
mechanism
by
caching
and
sharing
a
lot
of
gcs
with
all
needed
parameters
this
will
remove
the
load
of
subsequent
xchangegc
requests
from
the
connection
by
moving
it
toward
the
client
startup
phase
say
what
some
contributors
proposed
ideas

seem
right

i
notice
a
big
difference
i
try

i
will
reduce

usually
with
nice

the
server
and
the
client
are
competing
for
the
same
cpu
as
your
server
when
you
run
it
on
the
same
machine
not
really
a
major
problem
except
that
the
client
and
the
server
are
in
absolute
synchronicity
and
are
context
thrashing
timothy
h
panton
thpwesthawkuucp
firstly
it
relies
on
the
fact
that
most
cpus
are
mostly
idle
xs
cpu
usage
is
bursty
so
the
chances
of
you
and
your
teammate
doing
something
cpuintensive
at
the
same
time
is
small
if
they
are
not
then
you
get
twice
the
cpumemory
available
for
your
action
the
second
factor
is
that
context
switches
are
expensive
using
cpus
halves
them
you
pay
a
price
due
to
the
overhead
of
going
over
the
network
but
this
is
offset
in
most
cases
by
the
improved
buffering
of
a
network
typically
vs
for
a
pipe

even
fewer

painting
with
increasing
resolution
some
people
working
a
few
cubes
over
have
come
up
with
this
need
and
it
seems
that
someone
out
there
just
might
have
done
it
already
and
can
point
me
to
some
tools
that
would
help
what
theyd
like
to
do
is
given
a
window
that
is
taking
a
long
time
to
draw
because
either
the
data
is
arriving
over
a
slow
link
or
the
display
is
across
a
slow
link
they
would
like
to
first
paint
a
lowresolution
version
of
the
picture
and
then
repaint
it
in
higher
resolution
thus
the
picture
might
first
be
generated
in
resolution
with
each
square
of
pixels
being
filled
in
with
a
single
color
next
each
square
would
be
replaced
by
squares
finally
the
version
would
be
painted
since
one
of
the
scenarios
is
with
the
window
being
on
the
other
side
of
a
slow
link
the
lowres
version
obviously
wouldnt
be
transmitted
as
a
bitmap
that
wouldnt
help
at
all
instead
there
would
have
to
be
a
process
on
the
far
end
that
receives
the
lowres
picture
as
a
small
bitmap
and
blows
up
each
pixel
into
a
square
sorta
like
the
magnifier
programs
do
this
brings
up
the
question
of
whether
the
x
server
can
help
that
is
when
a
window
is
opened
is
there
a
way
to
ask
that
a
filter
program
be
run
to
process
the
pixels
or
is
the
only
way
to
use
something
like
rsh
to
start
up
a
remote
process
permission
denied
and
have
it
open
a
local
window
it
seems
the
most
likely
scenario
is
a
library
routine
that
starts
up
such
a
program
remotely
and
then
accepts
bitmaps
compressing
each
one
by
some
amount
and
sending
them
to
the
remote
program
to
expand
but
if
there
is
something
that
x
itself
can
do
to
help
its
be
nice
to
hear
about
it
i
looked
in
several
fms
but
if
its
there
i
obviously
dont
know
the
keywords
if
someone
has
a
nifty
tool
available
that
packages
it
all
we
might
want
to
get
a
copy
oh
yes
this
is
to
run
on
some
suns
part
of
the
idea
is
to
build
demos
that
can
show
such
things
as
if
this
were
run
across
say
a
link
this
is
how
fast
the
pictures
would
appear
then
the
customer
would
get
a
feel
for
the
speed
that
they
need
to
pay
for
if
the
auto
industry
were
like
the
computer
industry
a
car
would
now
cost
would
get

this
question
seems
to
come
up
often
enough
that
i
figured

x

is
available
in
demo
form
on
the
internet
via
anonymous
ftp
this
is
one
way
of

checking
out

feasability
of
using
your
system
as
an
x
server

performance
problem
ive
written
an

for

the
application
uses
xview
stuff
to
create
my
window
and
the
sun
xgl
graphics
library
for
rendering
into
the
canvas
the
application
does
realtime

but
it
does
not
update
the
the
display
fast
enough
im
using
notifysetitimer
xview
call
to
periodically
kick
off
my
update
routine
and
its
not
happening
fast
enough
i
want
it
to
update
times
second
its
only
doing
about
also
it
appears
to
be
compute
bound
because
if
i
run
anything
else
while
my
appplication
is
up
the
update
rate
slows
down
even
more
any
ideas

what

come
up

which
seem
to
meet

are
a

is

the

works

this

if
you
have

time
you
could
get
the
bdf
file
i
can
email
it
to
you
if
you
dont
have
it
or
dont
have
easy
access
to
the
x
source
and
could
make
your
own
bold
font
from
this
since
each
glyph
is
just
a
bitmap
you
could
write
a
program
to
convert
each
glyph
to
a

file
use
bitmap
to
make
each
glyph
bold
and
convert
the
results
back
to
bdf
format
then
use
bdftopcf
to
create
the

then
stick
the

xm
is
a
user
interface
framework
for
the
c
language
built
upon
and
the
xtoolkit
it
is
designed
to
be
a
simple
and
intuitive
programming
interface
to
access
the
functionality
of
commonly
used
widgets
xm
was
initially
created
for
the
motif
widget
set
now
support
for
the
athena
widgets
was
added
applications
created
with
xm
run
in
both
environments
without
changes
although
many
nice
features
are
only
available
when
using
motif
in
some
situations
xm
extends
the
underlying
toolkit
ie
providing
a
combobox
borrowed
from
mswindows
but
never
tries
to
replace
it
data
of
user
interface
objects
is
left
to
the
widgets
and
only
duplicated
in
rare
cases
xm
has
nothing
common
with
motif
besides
the
general
idea
to
encapsulate
motif
widgets
in
c
objects
and
the
in
its
name
many
ideas
for
the
xm
architecture
came
from
digitalks
smalltalk
version
which
provides
an
easy
to
use
framework
for
windowspmmac
applications
in
the
very
first
time
of
development
i
used
the
windows
dialog
editor
and
a
simple
parser
to
create
similar
smalltalk
and
xm
dialogs
top
level
objects
in
xm
windows
systemdialogs
and
toolboxes
which
use
the
automatic
layout
feature
of
various
composite
widgets
in
motif
and
xaw
userdialogs
which
can
be
individually
laid
out
with
a
user
interface
builder
a
first
version
of
such
a
dialog
editor
is
included
in
this

controls
children
of

gif
format
pictures
as
an
alternative
to
a

text
event
handling
is
done
by
a
simple
but
powerful
mechanism
which
redirects
xt
callbacks
to
member
functions
of
xm
objects
commoninteractii
is
built
upon
the
xm
drawing
class
and
provides
components
for
building
direct
manipulative
applications
is
is
a
very
simplified
implementation
of
some
features
from
the
commoninteract
system
research
project
of
our
institute
in
an
approach
to
define
a
software
achitecture
for
implementing
direct
manipulative
applications
with
multiple
interaction
media
ie
sound
alternative
input
devices
if
you
are
interrested
look
into
the
june
issue
of
the
joop
sigs
publications
journal
of
object
oriented
programming
there
should
be
our
paper
about
commoninteract
but
be
aware
that
it
is
our
state
of
the
art
from
commoninteractii
is
still
undocumented
and
is
included
because
it
was
used
to
implement
the
dialog
editor
it
currently
supports
only
drawing
primitives
lines
rectangles
circles
but
we
plan
to
extend
it
to
support
bitmaps
and
some
controls
also
known
problem
the
xm
drawing
class
has
no
redrawing
strategy
always
redraws
the
whole
window
even
after
minimal
changes
like
selecting
an
object
this
looks
very
ugly
on
slow
displays
and
should
be
fixed
about
this
first
release
xm
is
still
incomplete
and
has
a
lot
of
bugs
but
we
are
using
it
here
for
smaller
applications
which
are
running
without
problems
so
i
think
i
can
call
it
a
beta
release
which
can
be
used
to
develop
applications
for
any
noncritical
purposes
commoninteract
may
be
called
a
pre
alpha
release
its
development
will
be
continued
this
year
because
we
plan
to
use
it
for
another
research
project
here
besides
incompleteness
and
the
redrawing
problem
it
seems
to
be
stable
and
can
be
used
for
experimental
applications
platforms

someone

oh
boy
have
i
wanted
this
too
however
i
believe
that
the

be
under
the
servers
control
could
be
wrong
on
an
xterminal
for
example
if
the
server
was
not
the
one
controlling
the
cursor
then
trying
to
get
the
xterm
application
to
do
the
blinking
would
cause
needless
and
yucky
network
overhead
consistantly
most
people
who
write
cursor
blinking
code
just
implement
the
simple
case
a
straight
or
so
onoff
cycle
however
the
cursor
will
work
much
better
if
cursor
blinking
is
suppressed
ie
the
cursor
is
made
visible
any
time
the
cursor
moves
and
for
to
sec
thereafter
if
you
dont
do
this
the
cursor
will
be
hard
to
track
when
in
motion
you
allways
could
port
and
use
emu
from
exportlcsmiteducontribemutarz
weve
implemented
a
blinking
text
cursor
for
the
very
reasons
people
mentioned
you
can
even
configure
the
actual
size
of
the
text
cursor
horizontal
ver
tical
line
cursors
smaller
block
cursors
turn
on
and
off
blinking
set
the
blink
rate
and
so
on
you
even
get
blinking
text
ok
enough
advertising
i
havent
looked
at
the
xterm
code
in
this
respect
but
from
the
memories
i
have
when
we
had
to
decide
whether
to
start
with
xterm
and
make
it
do
what
we
wanted
mostly
the
blinking
text
id
say
it
wont
be
easy
since
xterm
is
a
hairy
mess
understandable
if
you
follow
its
roots
back
to
the
actual
task
to
get
the
cursor
to
blink
isnt
that
difficult
if
you
provide
the
right
hooks
as
antonio
mentioned
youll
have
to
show
the
cursor
directly
after
it
has
moved
or
people
will
become
confused
since
its
a
good
idea
to
take
the
cursor
off
the
screen
when
you
do
anything
on
screen
anyways
this
isnt
very
complicated
youll
just
have
to
start
the
blink
process
with
the
cursor
showing
directly
after
its
mapped
as
for
the
portability
of
emu
and
its
newest
version
the
one
on
export
is
still
the
same
as
on
the
contrib
tape
we
wanted
to
get
out
a
new
release
for
over
six
months
now
but
unfortunately
were
drowning
in
work
but
since
the
changes
arent
affectiong
emus
behavior
much
id
say
whoever
wants
to
try
emu
shouldnt
wait
for
a
new
version
as
is
emu
wont
work
on
bsd
derived
systems
eg
suns
with
anything
else
than
a
csh
there
is
a
fix
to
this
which
is
very
short

yes
that
is
a
bug
in
the
port
of
xterm
you
sometimes
get
this
when
you
start
from
xdm
i
have
reported
this
to
casper
but
dont
know
whether
it
made
it
into
his
set
of
patches
yet
basically
in
mitclientsxtermmainc
there
is
a
test
at
line
which
checks
errno
after
attempting
to
open
devtty
add
the
errno
einval
case
to
it
and
you
should
be
fine
its
actually
a
bug
in
the
solaris
kernel
we
could
add
a
workaround
to
xterm
open
should
never
return
einval
but
it
does
i
didnt
have
time
to
update
the
patch
lately
but
non
of
the
existing
problems
seem
to
warrant
a
new
set
of
patches
since
xsession
is
a
bourne
shell
script
anyway
you
might
as
well
add
a
line
etctimezone
as
it
is
done
in

xdm
coulda
also
keep

re

ok
im
being

trying

create

ie
press

a

appears
i
would
really
like
to
use
the

to
achieve
this

for

attempts
i
cannot
get
the

up
without
using

i
know
this
should
be
possible
to
to
with
an

a

something
is
escaping
me
read
the
documentation
for

the

the
reference
is

the

i
had
not
done
this

in

i
knocked
up
the

wcl

does
what
you

even
if
you

the

is
so
simple
it

that

you
will

from
my
own
notes
on
this
subject
methods
to
automatically
passwd
authorization
from
one
machine
to
another
this
also
includes
the
problem
of
notifing
the
remote
host
of
the
current
display
that
is
being
used
use
rshrexecon
the
method
in
the
xauth
manual
set
up
the
your
rhosts
file
in
the
home
directory
on
the
remote
machine
so
that
a
password
in
not
required
to
remotly
execute
commands
xauth
extract
display
rsh
other
xauth
merge
this
method
is
also
used
by
xrsh
to
pass
authorization
my
vampire
program
also
uses
a
variation
however
i
wrap
it
as
part
of
the
remote
command
sequence
eg
xauth
add
auth
included
in
this
method
is
the
use
of
xrlogin
and
xrsh
to
do
this
job
for
you
these
programs
usally
the
newer
ones
that
is
allow
you
to
pass
a
secified
list
of
environment
variables
which
includes
the
display
andor
a
copy
of
the
authorization
code
required
the
xon
program
available
if
enabled
on
sun
machines
will
also
pass
environment
variables
as
well
as
the
current
directory
you
will
however
be
required
to
store
the
authority
in
such
a
variable
for
passing
unless
you
are
also
have
shared
home
directories
warning
environment
variables
and
command
line
arguments
are
visible
in
ps
listing
with
the
appropiate
flags
as
such
passing
authorization
information
in
environment
variables
or
as
arguments
is
not
recomended
the
recommended
method
as
given
in
the
manual
shown
above
is
safe
from
the
view
of
other
users
wrap
it
as
part
of
the
term
environment
variable
this
method
uses
the
fact
that
most
remote
command
executors
do
pass
the
term
environment
variable
to
the
remote
host
it
is
then
a
matter
of
an
appropiate
script
in
your
remote
login
file
to
extract
the
information
from
the
term
environment
variable
and
set
up
things
appropiatly
a
version
of
the
xrlogin
script
is
available
on
the
network
which
does
this
basically
you
change
the
term
environment
variable
before
the
actual
call
to
rlogin
is
performed
to
include
your
display
and
your
authorization
on
the
remote
machine
you
then
extract
this
information
and
return
the
term
environment
variable
to
normal
before
you
use
it
for
reseting

sttying

you
have

that

this
involves
encrypting
the

or
project
and
having
the
remote
machine
finger
for
the
information
this
has
the
disadvantage
of
having
the
information
to
anyone
fingering
the
user
thus
requiring
a
encryption
method
that
is
uniq
to
each
individual
ie
the
method
of
decyrption
must
not
be
shared
or
known
by
others
nor
should
it
be
easy
to
determine
a
improvment
is
to
use
the
who
fingered
me
technique
to
only
give
the
information
only
to
your
own
remote
accounts
and
not
just
to
anyone
who
is
asking
this
last
method
was
developed
last
year
by
a
second
year
here
untill
i
explained
to
him
the
need
for
the
encryption
at
which
point
he
gave
up
this
method
it
is
however
a
valid
method
it
is
easer
than
but

re
blinking

in

as
quoted
from
by
bernwardmoepidoopende
bernward
averwald
back
in
the
days
of
i
did
analyse
the
xterm
code
the
cursor
was
implemented
by
drawing
a
rectangle
around
the
character
i
doesnt
seem
to
be
changed
til
now
but
if
you
have
the
sources
you
could
add
a
blinking
cursor
via
xtappaddtimeout
or
similar
the
server
overhead
for
this
is
mildly
ridiculous
though
see
also
desqviewx
which
does
this
in
its
dos
windows
do
you
really
want
xterm
to
wake
up
every
half

re

after

i
realized
the
follwing
my
problem
with
the

is
due
to
an
installation
problem
that
the

will
rescale
the

it
can
find
to
meet

you
can

help
needed
callbacks

i
understood
that
there
are
two
methods
to
connect
application
code
to
widgets
callbacks
and
actions
the
problem
i
face
now
is
that
i
have
a
quite
long
piece
of
application
code
that
performs
a
lot
of
drawing
into
a
window
i
want
to
connect
this
to
a
widget
no
problem
so
far
i
could
use
a
callback
function
or
an
action
to
do
this
processing
any
events
afterwards
but
because
the
drawing
takes
some
while
i
want
the
application
code
sequence
to
be
able
to
be
interrupted
by
events
then
i
want
to
handle
the
events
and
resume
with
processing
the
application
code
at
the
point
it
was
interrupted
it
seems
to
me
that
this
isnt
possible
but
how
can
i
give
the
user
the
impression
that
his
inputs
are
immediately
processed
has
anybody
an
idea

the

without

i
looked
twice
at

but
stopped
short
becuse
of
the
tty
part
is
there
a
cleaner
version
of
emu
that
supports
posix

explicitly
hmm
depends
on
how
you
define
clean
jordan
implemented
the
system
dependent
stuff
in
a
way
that
you
have
basic
implementations
for
call
it
operating
system
types
then
you
go
ahead
and
write
a
include
file
for
your
specific
machine
or
operating
system
using
the
basic
implementations
since
both
jordan
and
i
havent
encountered
a
os
flavor
yet
that
is
fully
posix
we
havent
gotten
around
to
really
implement
and
test
a
toplevel
include
file
specifically
for
just
posix
the
posix
routines
are
used
in
the
sun
specific
file
ttysuni
for
example
but
here
we
also
use
some
bsd
stuff
all
in
all
it
still
is
probably
better
to
implement
a
include
file
for
each
and
every
operating
system
than
ifdefing
in
existing
ones
the
type
of
mess
that
can
result
from
that
can
clearly
be
seen
in
the
xterm
sources
even
if
quite
a
bit
of
code
gets
copied
almost
unchanged
a
couple
of
times
this
only
uses
up
some
disk
space
since
only
the

actually
included
from

will
be
compiled
into

it
shouldnt
be
hard
to
come
up
with

that
fully
relies

the

unfortunately

the
problem
is
that
we
need
solutions
for
applications
now
and
although
i
would
love
to
have
most
of
the
things
mentioned
here
somebody
has
to
write
it
what
id
like
to
see
is
this
scenario
each
widget
view
whatever
describes
its
colors
via
a
palette
palettes
can
be
shared
and
they
only
contain
descriptive
information
they
are
not
directly
tied
to
the
object
that
uses
them
palettes
are
held
in
the
server
a
palette
can
accomadate
up
to
the
number
of
hardware
color
cells
of
color
descriptors
when
the
input
focus
is
in
a
particular
widget
that
widget
has
access
to
all
of
the
colors
that
are
described
in
its
associated
palette
all
other
widgets
transiently
get
the
closest
approximation
that
can
be
generated
by
a
union
of
the
colors
from
the
current
palette
and
any
free
colors
that
are
left
over
a
widget
specifies
a
color
for
imaging
by
providing
an
index
pixel
into
its
associated
palette

bold

is
hard

re

needed
callbacks
actions
and
events
i
understood
that
there
are
two
methods
to
connect
application
code
to
widgets
callbacks
and
actions
the
problem
i
face
now
is
that
i
have
a
quite
long
piece
of
application
code
that
performs
a
lot
of
drawing
into
a
window
i
want
to
connect
this
to
a
widget
no
problem
so
far
i
could
use
a
callback
function
or
an
action
to
do
this
processing
any
events
afterwards
but
because
the
drawing
takes
some
while
i
want
the
application
code
sequence
to
be
able
to
be
interrupted
by
events
then
i
want
to
handle
the
events
and
resume
with
processing
the
application
code
at
the
point
it
was
interrupted
it
seems
to
me
that
this
isnt
possible
but
how
can
i
give
the
user
the
impression
that
his
inputs
are
immediately
processed
use
a
workproc
see
you
should
split
your
drawing
routnie
up
into
small
chunks
this
is
the
hard
part
then
in
the
callback
that
starts
the
drawing
you
call
xtappaddworkproc
to
call
your
workproc
the
first
time
your
workproc
should
be
a
function
that
returns
a
boolean
true
when
you
are
finished
and
false
when
you
want
to
keep
processing
if
you
return
false
the
workproc
is
automatically
reinstalled
note
that
this
method
is
better
that
using
a
timeout
loop
since
events
get
processed
in
a
more
precedenceoriented
manner
if
you
are
using
the
same
ada
bindings

am

are

makedepend
problem
hi
netters
we
have
a
problem
with
makedepend
it
doesnt
know
how
to
correctly
process
if
clause
in
c
preprocessor
statements
it
evaluates
everything
to
true
no
matter
what
the
conditionals
are
for
example
makedepend
chokes
on
one

include

if
definedstdc
include
stringh
define
index
strchr
define
rindex
strrchr
else
bsd
stdc
include
stringsh
endif
stdc
here
makedepend
evaluates
both
if
and
corresponding
else
statements
to
true
and
tries
to
open
the
file
stringsh
which
doesnt
exist
under
we
also
have
a
lot
of
if
statements
in
some
of
our
legacy
code
we
got
and
built
makedepend
off
the
net
it
didnt
fix
the
problem
in
all
fairness
it
should
be
noted
that
makdepend
manpage
suns
distribution
mentions
this
problem
bugs
if
you
do
not
have
the
source
for
cpp
the
berkeley
c
preprocessor
then
makedepend
will
be
compiled
in
such
a
way
that
all
if
directives
will
evaluate
to
true
regardless
of
their
actual
value
this
may
cause
the
wrong
include
directives
to
be
evaluated
makedepend
should
simply
have
its
own
parser
written
for
if
expressions
has
anybody
come
up
with
some
solutionfix
to
makdepend
other

that

you
will
find

its

the

i
was
informed
by
a

that
the
pageview
program
does
require
dsc

postscript
there
was
the
possibility
that
it
was
going
to
be
changed
so
that
if
the
file
wasnt
dsc
compliant
that
it
would
stop
at
each
showpage
i
believe
that
this
method
would
preclude
being
able
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
through
the
file
ie
you
could
only
go
forward
to
the
next
showpage
this
isnt
in

but
maybe
it
is
in
the

ow
in

find
pageview
extremely
useful

the

set
up
an

that
longjmps

where
i
made
the

is
this
safe
do
i
have

can
i
just
return
badwindow
is
an

error
if
you
write
a
custom

which
does

the
error
handler
will
return
and
let

using

is
the
way

running

aix
and
on
a

since
i
run
x
on
both
colour
and
blackwhite

i
need
different

for
the
same
resource
so
i
want
to
use

color
in
my
application
defaults
files
however
cpp
is
only
invoked
by
xrdb
and
not
when
the
resources
are
loaded
on
demand
is
there
a
proper
solution
to
this
so
far
the
only
proper
solution
ive
come
to
think
of
is
to
create
different
files
in
my
appdefaults
say
xterm
and
xtermcolor
and
set
my
xfilesearchpath
to
either
hometn
or
hometncolor
but
that
does
not
always
seem
to
work
eg
executing
a
remote
shell
command
without
reading
the
cshrc
does
not
set
xfilesearchpath
furthermore
i
thought
of
using
include
xterm
in
xtermcolor
however
for
resources
in
xterm
that
i
want
to
override
in
xtermcolor
things
are
different
on
both
machines
on
a
sun
the
first
found
resource
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xterm
the
bw
one
while
on
an
the
last
found
value
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xtermcolor
what
can
i
do
about
it
i
have
one
last
question
for
the
specification
of
xfilesearchpath
i
can
use
t
n
c
and
s
t
stands
for
appdefaults
n
for

one
of
major
flaws
of

is
the
horrendous
number
of
transactions
and
hence
process
switches
that
it
forces
upon
a
host
actual
measurements
hourly
average
are
per
second
per
logged
in
user
which
can
lead
to
or
more
process
switches
depending
on
whether
each
event
is
filtered
by
the
window
manager
as
well
as
the
applications
and
how
many
processes
are
needed
for
each
character
while
a
blinking
cursor
needs
only
the
application
and
the
networking
process
and
does
not
add
any
transactions
it
will
add
something
like
process
switches
per
second
per
user
this
is
a
significant
increase
in
overhead
especially
as
the
application
may
have
quite
a
large
working
set
if
you
want
a

there
could

moving
the
mouse
out
of
the
xterm
window
before
clicking
up
will
not
abort
the
paste
in
fact
once
that
middle
button
is
pressed
down
the
paste
is
inevitable
so
the
obvious
questions
is
there
some
way
around
this
and
do
others
feel
that
moving
the
mouse
out
of
an
xterm
window
before
release
should
abort
the
paste
i
would
have
thought
this
would
have
been
a
common
enough
problem
that
someone
would
have
changed
xterm
by
now
but
maybe
its
just
me
michael
it
is
not

have
been
aggravated

would
