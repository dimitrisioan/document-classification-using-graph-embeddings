keep

my

im
worried
theyll
get

up
please
dont

inevitably

outrage
that

more
important
than
smcapboldfontgod
lawsmcapboldfont
but
thats
irrelevant
to
the
problem
here
windows
came
with
my
system
but
on
disks
i
hate
using
disks
so
i
copied
them
over
to
high
density
using
xcopy
it
worked
fine
in
fact
for
a
while
i
was
changing
configurations
and
whatnot
so
much
that
i
decided
to
try
putting
them
on
the
hard
disk
not
only
can
you
copy
them
over
with
one
disk
per
directory
but
if
you
want
to
you
can
simply
copy
them
all
into
one
directory
makes
it
a
lot
nicer
when
youre
switching
printer
emulations
around
norton
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
but
when
a
friends
system
crashed
we
restored
from
a
backup
rather
than
from
the
originals
and
it
worked
fine
this
would
imply
that
arj
a

norton
cnu
would
create
a
workable
backup
and
if
you
did
a
full
install
the
first

youve

see

another

ive
been
seeing
all
kinds

complaints

lately
on
here
i
thought
i
post
my
recent
pleasant
experiences
my
machine
this
past
friday
this
was
two
weeks
to
the
day
from
when
i
called
the
order
in
upon
unboxing
it
i
found
everything
to
be
in
perfect
order
all
the
peripherals
i
ordered
were
properly
installed
cdrom
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
gateway
documentation
all
software
came
with
the
original
disks
and
manuals
the
gateway
manual
itself
is
in
a
nice
binder
the
ati
gup
came
with
drivers
all
other
software
i
specified
microsoft
office
was
properly
installed
the
machine
came
right
up
out
of
the
box
and
has
been
performing
flawlessly
its
been
on
all
weekend
and
it
hardly
even
reaches
room
temperature
i
think
the
big
roomy
tower
case
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
its
up
and
running
dos
with
no
problems
ive
also
read
about
some
people
having
problems
with
high
speed
serial
communications
i
used
the
dos
interlink
program
which
lets
me
link
to
my
old
computer
via
a
serial
port
at
baud
it
then
maps
the
other
machines
two
hard
disks
as
my
disks
f
g
you
can
cd
to
these
drives
and
either
run
programs
or
copy
files
its
almost
like
a
peerpeer
lan
except
you
can
also
run
programs
on
the
other
machine
its
not
a
two
way
street
the
other
machine
is
the
server
and
this
machine
is
the
client
so
thats
where
it
seems
to
differ
from
the
peer
to
peer
stuff
for
a
bundled
dos
utility
its
very
impressive
my
took
about
minutes
to
back
up
of
data
i
also
bypassed
any
potential
gateway
monitor
problems
by
taking
the
credit
and
applying
it
towards
a

i
love
this
monitor
so
im

so
by

i
save

get

over

phone
free
software
package
have
fun
trying

get
hold
of
technical
support
over
the

at

locally
you
can
walk
right
up

the

and
tell
him
what
is
wrong
and
he
has
to
fix
it
phone
support
is
quick

competent
from
many
mail

firms
but
not
so
quick
and
not
so
competent
from
others
gateway
included
but
my
experience
with
computer
retailers
which
is
significant
has
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
sales
personnel
and
retailtechnical
personnel
are
forbidden
to
actually
learn
about
the
products
they
sell
talk
about
incompetent
ok
so
a
few
percent
of
their
answers
are
correct
but
those
salesmen
dont
even
realize
how
stupid
they
are
ok
ill
settle
down
now
let
me
catch
my
breath
fact
retail
stores
never
provide
a
better
value
in
terms
of
price
per
product
retail
outlets
are
desirable
however
to
those
people
who
arent
interested
in
learning
about
computers
enough
to
make
their
own
decisions
this
is
fine
for
example
most
of
my
education
about
carpeting
wall
paper
lawn
mowers
microwave
ovens
etc
has
come
from
sales
personnel
i
assume
i
must
be
an
idiot
but
i
dont
care
about
those
things
i
do
however
care
about
my
computer
ie
i
demand
features
and
performance
and
ill
be
damned
if
ill
pay
some

the
guy
told
me
that
it
had
been
fully
tested
and
that
it
was
good
i
took
it
home
to
install
in
my
compaq
portable
ok
im
a
little
behind
in
technology
i
already
had
an
mfm
controller
i
installed
the
drive
and
powered
up
the
system
i
got
a
post
error
my

c
as
i
said
above
the
drive
is
a
seagate
the
system
is
a

circa
ah
finally
a
question
i
can
answer
i
mess
with
this
older
stuff
alot
kinda
fun
first
problem
i
can
forsee
is
that
the

not
be
compadible
with
that
wd
card
unless
it
has
the
right
bios
rom
check
the
numbers
on
it
it
should
be
the
only
nonsmt
chip
on
the
board
slightly
below
center
and
left
the
bios
should
read
either
or
if
the

are
you
got
problems

the
primary

address
the

jumpers
are
as
follows

looks
right
art
deleted
here
are
my
questions
are
the
drive
and
controller
compatible
w
each
other
i
notice
you
left
out
the
jumper
table
settings
those
are
what
control
what

the

thinks
it
has

it
i
dont
have
the
big
book
right
here

the
jumpers
on
the

set
correctly
see
above
you
might
have
problems
if
the
jumpers
are
not
right
also
at
the
risk
of
being
insulting
make
sure
the
cables
are
on
right
and
good
on
the
jumper
on
the
try
moving
it

eg

program

on

anyone
have
any
ideas

that
they
may
encode

that

yes
there
is
a
dx
and
version
of
the
if
you
are
considering
buying
one
or
the
other
definitely
go
for
the
dx
with
a
nice
size
external
cache
the
performance
is
far
greater
the
only
has
the
internal
cache
to
work
with
at
while
the
dx
has
a
potentially
much
larger
cache
to
work
at
with
neither
systems
could
actually
run
a
program
out
of
main

since
dram
is
still
too
slow

mg
i
went
buying
simms
recently
and
the
sales
person
told
me
that
the
mg
are
simms
and
simms
and
one
cannot
use
them
interchan
mg
if
you
use
one
you
have
to
use
all
of
the
same
type
dont
believe
everything
you
are
told
i
can
tell
you
that
mixing
them
between
banks
ok
and
i
cant
see
why
mixing
in
one
bank
is
not
unless
they
are
of
different
speeds
eg
mixing
of
and
simms
in
one
bank
the
two
only
differ
in
the
type
of
chips
it
uses
assuming
that
the
simms
are
bit
wide
here
is
the
two
equivalent
configuration
the
simm
uses
two
wide
of
nibbles
and
one
wide
chip
for
a
total
of
wide
the
simm
uses
nine
wide
chips
these
are
equivalent
because
of
the
way
that
it
is
pinned
on
the
simm
board
at
the
simm
interface
they
both
act
as
wide
simms
sorry
if
too
techie
for
ya
mg
similarly
one
cannot
plug
in
two
simms
and
one
simms
to
gi
mg
the
system
a
total
of
meg
why
is
that
so
if
my
system
supports
mg
of
meg
it
has
simm
slots
can
i
plug
in
simms
to
give
my
mg
that
sounds
correct
the
problem
is
that
if
your
computer
takes
wide
simms
you
can
not
mix
different
sizes
in
one
bank
why
you
ask
simple
if
you
understand
why
there
is
banks
assuming
you
have
a
cpu
or
the
data
bus
eg
the
mechanism
to
retrieve
data
from
memory
is
wide
so
the
computer
expects
to
see
bits
when
it
asks
for
data
to
get
that
bandwidth
wide
the
motherboard
links
one
bit
is
not
data
but
parity
so
i
will
ignore
that
in
this
simple
explaination
to
get
bits
that
means
that
a
simm
in
a
bank
stores
only
of
the
bit
wide
data
if
you
have
a
bus
two
simms
are
linked
together
to
get
wide
data
which
is
the
reason
why
banks
are
simms
wide
and
banks
are
simms
wide
if
your
computer
required
eg
wide
data
with
parity
bits
used
in
some
and
asts
you
could
upgrade
by
one
simm
at
a
time
hope
that
this
message
is
not
over
your
head
but
the
answer
to
your
question
was
not
simple
i
could
of
just
said
because
i
said

my

changed

even

i

help
needed
hello
i
hope
somebody
out
here
can
help
me
i
am
currently
working
on
a
project
where
i
am
trying
to
communicate
from
an
ibm
with
phoenix
bios
using
c
to
a
board
that
i
made
with
an
intel
cpu
with
uart
chip
the
board
works
fine
with
the
transmit
command
and
terminal
emulation
mode
of
kermit
but
there
seems
to
be
something
wrong
with
the
initialization
or
protocol
used
when
i
try
c
i
need
to
access
the
unit
i
built
using
c
because
i
have
a
sizable
chunk
of
c
code
that
i
will
be
using
to
perform
calculations
and
operations
that
will
be
very
difficult
to
code
in
assembly
language
for
the
i
have
included
the
assembly
code
that
i
am
running
and
the
c
code
that
i
am
trying
to
use
if
anyone
can
show
me
something
that
i
am
doing
blatantly
incorrectly
or
that
i
am
missing
because
of
my
lack
of
knowledge
about
serial
communications
please
email
me
i
wrote
the
assembly
language
to
wait
for
a
character
to
be
received
and
then
to
check
it
against
the
character
if
a
is
received
the
leds
will
indicate
this
two
c
programs
that
i
have
written
do
nothing
but
set
up
com
port
and
send
the
character
one
uses
the
bioscom
function
in
biosh
the
other
uses
the
software
interrupt
function
in
dosh
i
have
triple
checked
the
baud
rate
the
parity
none
the
stop
bits
the
character
length
bits
and
the
interrupt
calls
for
currently
i
am
at
a
loss
as
to
what
may
be
wrong
any
hardware

i
read
the
fine

between
double

policies
of
amex
and
citibank

sure
both
will
allow
you
double

you

send

regarding
this
there
is
no

and
you
only
have
to
notify
them
of

when
the

needs
repair
if
it
cant
be
repaired
you
get

either
the

do

howdy
sorry
if
this
has
been
covered
before
one
of
my
pc
illiterate
friends
asked
me
to
help
him
install
drdos
on
his
nec
powermate
sx
of
course
i
said
no
problem
and
went
to
work
unfortunately
the
drdos
refuses
to
recognize
the
hard
drive
during
installation
even
though
i
am
still
able
to
boot
off
of
the
hard
drive
using
the
old
dos
after
openning
it
up
i
discovered
it
was
using
an
seagate
scsi
controller
on
a
scsi
drive
i
then
booted
with
drdos
off
of
the
floppy
a
second
time
and
ran
fdisk
to
see
if
i
could
access
the
drive
lo
and
behold
the
primary
mbyte
partition
was
intact
created
by
dos
no
less
i
didnt
think
you
could
go
over
a
partition
in
the
older
doses
i
could
be
wrong
i
then
tried
to
remove
the
primary
partition
which
it
wouldnt
allow
me
to
do
i
am
unaware
of
anything
special
that
has
to
be
done
with
a
scsi
drive
i
kinda
expected
it
to
work
just
like
an
idemfmrll
drive
for

installations
any
suggestions
would
be
greatly
appreciated

does
it
do
it
to
all
tapes
were
the
two
tapes
that
it
unwound
of
the
same
type
from
the
same
batch
the
reason
i
ask
is
that
i
bought
some
generic
tapes
that
did
this
and
found
that
the
tape
markers
were
not
fully
punched
out
and
had
closed
the
little
marker
hole
it
was
only
on
a
few
tapes
of
a
set
did
you
open
up
the
tape
cartridge
and
put
the
tape
back
on
the
reels
if
you
have
not
yet
open
it
up
by
removing
the
two
screws
on
the
bottom
of
the
tape
cartridge
and
snap
the
plastic
shell
away
from
the
metal
base
as
you
are
pulling
the
tape
through
the
assembly
try
not
to
touch
any
more
than
you
have
to
as
you
are
doing
it
look
for
a
couple
of
little
holes
in
the
tape
these
are
the
marker
holes
which
let
the
tape
drive
know
when
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
tape
the
holes
are
spaced
a
couple
of
inches
apart
my
best
guess
is
that
the
drive
finds
the
first
marker
and
then
stops
on
the
second
marker
anyhow
if
the
tape
has
the
holes
then
check
to
see
if
the
mirror
on
the
tape
is
clean
the
function
of
the
mirror
is
to
detect
the
marker
holes
the
tape
drive
shines
a
light
at
the
mirror
and
has
a
pickup
in
the
area
where
the
reflection
would
come
out
when
the
hole
goes
by
the
pickup
detects
the
light
that
was
allowed
to
pass
and
it
knows
when
to
stop
if
the
mirror
is
dirty
or
out
of
alighment
unlikely
since
it
is
made
into
the
case
you
might
have
a
problem
detecting
the
end
of
the
tape
if
the
tape
drive
does
it
on
all
tapes
and
the
tapes
all
look
good
then
either
the
pickup
or
the
led
of
the
sensor
system
has
failed
or
is
dirty
if
you
open
the
drive
door
you
will
see
the
sensor
assembly
to
the
left
of
the
rw
head
assembly
if
it
looks
clean
and
nothing
is
in
its
way
then
the
drive
may
need
to
be
serviced
it
is
possible
that
the
led
is
burned
out
or
the
sensor
is
out
if
it
is
still
in
warranty
you
might
be
able

send

supposedly

anything

in

with

of
that

that
part
i
dont

because
the

on

so
the

should
have
no

talking

can
anybody
explain
this
the

is
with

ram
boards
on
a
hello
i
have
a
isa
machine
with
pheonix
bios
currently
i
have
megabytes
of
ram
installed
via
eight
mg
simms
on
the
motherboard
ie
both
banks
are
full
and
there
is
no
space
for
more
simms
i
am
thinking
of
running
on
my
machine
and
possibly
linux
with
x
windows
and
i
know
that
more
ram
would
be
helpful
however
with
simms
the
only
solution
i
can
see
is
to
sell
my
megs
for
about
and
by
simms
for
about
used
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
cant
afford
the
price
right
now
the
entire
process
of
selling
ram
and
buying
it
used
probably
means
that
the
machine
might
be
down
for
a
number
of
days
which
i
would
rather
avoid
so
my
question
is
do
the
at
ram
boards
that
plug
into
a
free
slot
work
well
with
a
isa
machine
i
have
seen
some
being
sold
used
for
about
with
mg
with
space
for
another
if
these
boards
do
work
how
do
they
do
it
is
a
device
driver
needed
or
will
the
bios
pickup
the
extra
ram
as
it
does
with
the
simms
on
the
mother
board
i
know
that
the
isa
expansions
slots
are
and
simm
memory
is
bits
so
probably
all
of
this
is
just
wishful
thinking
however
any
help
is
truly
appreciated

what

the

if

something
to
bear
in
mind
is
what
the

the
origional
intention
of
the

was
to
speed
up
the

so
that
large
memory

transfers
would
be
faster
this
is
espically
useful
in
transfering
data
from
main
memory
to

there
are
usually
vlb

card
makers
have

about
an

move

this
doesnt
answer
the
original
question
is
a
multiuser
os
and
no
mention
was
made
of
an
ether
card
either
but
from
a
diskdata
point
of
view
why
does
scsi
have
an
advantage
when
it
comes
to
multi
tasking
data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on
the
drive
can
scsi
find
it
faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive
and
into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
you
are
making
the
same
mistake
i
did
you
are
confusing
the
drive
interface
to
the

from
my
mac

on

in
the

as
expansion
both
mac

scsi
only

interface
common
to
both
mac
and
ibm
allows
the
use
of
any
device
hard

printer
scanner
nubus
card
expansion
mac
plus
only
some
monitors
and
cdrom
apple
developed
some
specifications
for
scsi
controlers
while
ibm
has
no
exact
controller
specifications
which
results
in
added
incompatibilities
on
ibm
machines
main
problem
there
are
a
lot
of
external
devices
which
are
internal
terminated
which
causes
problems
for
more
then
two
devises
off
the
scsi
port
a
scsi
chain
is
supposed
to
be
terminated
only
at
the
begining
and
at
the
end
any
other
set
up
causes
problems
for
either
mac
or
ibm
devices
per
scsi
controller
asynchronous
ave
and
synchronous
max
transfer
base
requires
a
controler
chip
and
can
provide
only

not

which
are
both
interfaces
see
devices
per
scsi
controller
in
mode
is
fully
complient
and
tends
to
be
implimented
as
a
very
fast
since
it
needs
a
different
controller
interface
in
both
hardware
which
tends
to
be
very
expendsive
and
software
transfer
speeds
are
with
burst
with
burst
and
with
burst
and
fast
in
mode
is
limited
to
devices
and
reduced

fast

due
to
the
difference
between

wide

ibm

interfaces
limited

lack

development
ide
integrated

electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more

one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
so
at
its
lowest
setting
interface
in
asynchronous
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
through
put
the
cost
of
scsi
interface
is
a
self
fulliling
prophisy
few
people
buy
scsi
because
it
is
so
expencive
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convices
makes
that
mass
producing
scsi
which
would
reduce
its
cost
is
unwarented
and
so
scsi
is
expencive
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
items
sold
the
less
each
item
has
to
bare
the
brunt
the
cost
of
manufacture
and
so
the
less
each
item
has
to
cost
allows
a
drive

sorry
another
gateway
posting
i
never
thought
id
contribute
to
a
gateway
thread
either
pro
or
con
but
my
spleen
could
use
a
little
venting
the
scenario
ordered
a
w
ultrastor
local
bus
hd
controller
receive
system
days
after
ordering
happy
discover
ultrastor
isa
hd
controller
inside
unhappy
call
gateway
receive
the
correct
controller
in
days
getting
happier
new
controller
doesnt
work
unhappy
again
call
gateway
again
get
another
controller
in
more
days
cooling
off
the
end
is
in
sight
this
controller
doesnt
work
either
motherboard
is
bad
very
unhappy
gateways
solution
they
will
order
me
a
new
motherboard
more
days
and
have
onsite
service
install
it
for
me
but
i
have
to
take
a
day
off
of
work
because
the
service
people
only
work
mf
i
say
no
way
ive
already
blown
about
hours
with
this
about
of
them
on
hold
and
i
dont
have
the
time
or
to
take
a
day
off
work
also
my
day
return
period
is
almost
over
and
ive
only
been
able
to
use
the
thin
for
about
minutes
so
the
whole
thing
is
going
back
i
was
extremely
upset
when
i
began
this
post
because
the
support
rep
told
me
that
i
would
have
to
pay
shipping
not
only
for
the
returned
system
but
also
the
two
hard
drive
controllers
they
had
sent
me
fortunately
i
just
spoke
to
customer
service
and
they
are
going
to
have
ups
come
and
pick
everything
up
gratis
the
only
downside
is
that
now
i
have
to
order
another
computer
i
would
really
like
to
try
gateway
again
im
just
very
turned
off
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
try
and
get
through
to
customer
service
or
tech
support
again
i
think
their
products
are
great
for
the
most
part
but
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
the
savings
are
worth
the
potential
aggravation
are
other
mail
order
companies
as
difficult
to
contact
i
know
gateway
is
booming
and
for
good
reason
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
take
it
again
oh
well
i
feel
better
now

adaptec
problem
hello
i
have
recently
suffered
from
various
problems
concerning
an
adaptec
controller
problem
floppy
disk
drive
doesnt
work
theres
apparently
at
least
two
jumpers
on
the
controller
that
affect
the
floppy
disk
drive
unfortunately
i
have
located
only
one
of
them
in
the
lower
front
corner
i
would
like
to
know
if
there
are
any
other
such
jumpers
and
possibly
where
they
are
located
problem
my
hard
disks
refuse
to
boot
with
my
two
scsi
hds
rodime
miniscribe
i
get
a
message
missing
operating
system
even
though
the
disks
have
been
formatted
with
the
same
controller
and
they
damn
sure
have
an
operating
system
on
them
if
i
boot
from
a
quantum
i
might
get
as
far
as
getting
the
msdos
version
information
this
might
of
course
be
due
to
incombatible
memory
drivers
are
there
any
jumpers
that
could
affect
the
hd
causing
such
errors
thanks
in
advance

sb
card
is
supposed
to
share
irq
with

in

this

works
well
however
sometimes
there

it

to
depend
on
the
software
more
than
anything
else
origin
games
are
especially
bitchy
about
having
the
whole
interrupt
to
themselves
my
solution
was
to
switch
the
interrupt
to
irq
which
is
unreserved
in
contemporary
computers
using
irq
for
the
drives
went
out
with
the

architechture
dont
put
the
sb
in
irq
if
you
have
an
xt
get
a
new
computer
instead
this
irq
has
been
completely
stable
for

i
use
my
sb
to
play
mods

wavs
under

a
free

for

better
pcarchitecture
machines
with
no
problems
as
well
as
games
under
dos
i
also
use
irq
but
there
is
one
disadvantage
some
games
assume
that
the
board
is
using
irq
and
have
no
way
to
adjust
this
setting

however
it
is

only

i
think
with
my

it
works
only
in
graphics
modes
and
not
much
use
since
just
about
any
application
will
set
the
mode
to
something
else
especially
if
it
wants
to
do
text
i
suppose
anyway
is
there
any
way
that
i
can
use
this
as
a

with

if
not
can
i
do

bgrubbdantenmsuedu
grubb
writes
point
of
view
why
does
scsi
have
an
advantage
when
it
comes
to
multi
tasking
data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on
the
drive
can
scsi
find
it
faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive
and
into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
so
at
its
lowest
setting
interface
in
asynchronous
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
as
implimented
on
what
system
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
through
put
given
the
original
question
scsi
used
only
as
a
single
hard
drive
controller
is
it
then
necessary
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at
least
maybe
megssec
for
the
scsi
choice
to
make
any
sence
what
does
a
meg
megssec
scsi
drive
cost
the
cost
of
scsi
interface
is
a
self
fulliling
prophisy
few
people
buy
scsi
because
it
is
so
expencive
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convices
makes
that
mass
producing
scsi
which
would
reduce
its
cost
is
unwarented
and
so
scsi
is
expencive
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
items
sold
the
less
each
item
has
to
bare
the
brunt
the
cost
of
manufacture
and
so
the
less
each
item
has
to
cost
the
original
cga
cart
back
in
was
i
think
the
original
ega
card
or
pga
was
scsi
has
stood
relatively
alone
in

your

that

of

buying

over
the

scsi
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
come
down
in

i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented

highway

i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better

help
dear
all
i
am
trying
to
get
my

going

a

know
that
my
router
and

is
working
because
i
am
able
to
ping

and
even
telnetd
with
it
however
after
a
time
it
crashes
randomly
help
would
be
greatly

suspect
that
there
is
a
hardware
conflict
in
the
pc
i
am
running
with
a

the
ethernet
card
is
configured
for

thanks
in

that
its
not
much
to
go
on
but
i
dont
even
know
what
the
questions
to

hi
i
have
an
orchid
fahrenheit
vlb
with
of
dram
it
is
an
based
card
i
had
a
problem
for
a
while
after
installing
my
second
meg
of
dram
for
the
video
and
thanks
to
orchid
i
got
a
fix
from
their
tech
support
it
was
jumper
settings
not
given
in
the
ordinary
manual
i
assume
it
would
come
with
memory
ordered
from
them
so
i
guess
i
should
be
glad
they
didnt
just
say
buy
the
memory
from
us
or
something
like
that
the
one
thing
that
i
was
puzzled
by
was
why
there
was
not
a
color
mode
on
the
thing
either
in
full
screen
or
enlarged
desktop
mode
my
ati
ultra
plus
can
handle
that
given
of
memory
all
the
buys
you
on
the
fahrenheit
is
just
one
more
mode
geez
had
i
known
i
wouldnt
have
bothered
i
asked
them
why
and
all
i
got
was
your
point
is
well
taken
but
orchids
software
developers
are
busy
with
other
projects
so
to
get
to
the
point
finally
are
there
any
drivers
out
there
that
can
handle
high
res
hicolor
modes
id
love
to
get
another
card
but
perhaps
it
will
have
to
wait
until
the
next
generation
of
cards
comes
out
since
this
card
came
bundled
with
my
system
and
its
not
so
easy
to
exchange
these
things
unless
theyre
broken
if
you
want
these
modes
steer
away
from
orchids
cards
ie
vlb
or
vavlb
at
least
until
their
developers
are
less
busy
if
the
magazines
are
to
believed
ive
only
seen
one
product
thus
far
which
can
handle
color
genoa
although
evenn
that
might
be
a
misprint
please
if
there
are
generic
or
semigeneric
drivers
out
there
let
me
know
where
i
can

is

your

you

that

irq

my
solution
was
to
switch
the

to
irq
which
is
unreserved
in
contemporary
computers
using
irq
for
the
drives
went
out
with
the
xt
architechture
not
completly
true
for
at
class
and
later
machines
is
reserved
for
since
its
rare
to
have
a
second
parallel
port
in
a
pc
its
usually
a
good
safe
choice
if
you
need
an
interrupt
on
the
other
hand
we
just
ran
into
a
problem
with
that
here
at
work
on
a

computer
it
has
a
modem
on
a

on
and
the
other
serial
port
was
set
to
which
normally
uses
the
same
interrupt
as
we
had
a
real
fight
with
a
board
when
trying
to
use
and
discoverd
the
problem
was
that
gateway
had
set
it
up
such
that
used

soon
as
we
disabled

cache
or

eisavlb
motherboard
this
might
be
a
silly
question
but
i
have
to
ask
it
anyway
i
am
in
the
process
of
purchasing
an
eisavl
bus
computer
and
i
found
two
places
that
sell
machines
that
have
what
i
want
and
have
the
same
price
the
first
is
ares
and
they
use
a
cache
motherboard
thats
the
brand
of
the
motherboard
with
opti
chip
set
the
other
is
micron
formerly
edge
technology
and
they
use
the
micronics
eisavlb
motherboard
i
said
that
this
might
be
a
silly
question
since
i
believe
that
micronics
is
a
very
well
known
motherboard
manufacturer
while
i
never
heard
of
cache
i
am
however
leaning
towards
the
ares
machine
because
my
impression
is
that
they
are
known
for
building
good
solid
machines
and
they
have
good
tech
support
hr
dayswk
and
a
better
warrantee
years
micron
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
recently
aquired
edge
technologies
and
im
not
sure
how
much
i
should
trust
the
company
i
would
really
appreciate
any
input
on
this
is
the
micron
machine
the
clear
choice
does
anyone
know
anything
positive
or
negative
about
either
company
has
anyone
ever
heard
of
cache
motherboards
should
i
go
with

just

it

i
dont

how
common

serious
these

may
be
i
would

some

who
have

btw
this

i
have
a
similar

colorado
on

the
problems
are
o
firstly
gateway
shipped
me
only
mb
tapes
even
though
the
drive
is
a
mb
unit
when
i
called
to
complain
they
only
said
thats
all
we
carry
and
with
compression
you
can
fit
mb
on
one
tape
maybe
so
but
then
why
did
i
pay
extra
for
the
large
capacity
tape
drive
you
got
suckered
in
the
same
way
i
did
silly
me
believing
that
the
logo
on
the
front
meant
actual
carrying
capacity
the
people
who
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
a

call
it
marketing
lawyers
who
prosecute
it
call
it

perhaps
we
can
have
a

of
other
duped
buyers
march

o
i
have
about
mb
of
data
on
my
c
drive
i
choose
the
spaceoptimizing
compression
scheme
and
started
a
full
backup
the
software
estimated
it
would
take
about
minutes
it
took
hours
does
this
sound
about
right
this
is
a
bit
long
my
system
takes
about
minutes
to
do
the
same
thing
usually
hours
particularly
if
the
tape
is
grinding
away
the
whole
time
means
that
your
block
size
for
the
write
is
too
small
is
there
any
way
to
change
the
block
size
or
write
buffer
size
so
its
bigger
o
during
the
backup
about
a
dozen
files
came
up
with
access
denied
errors
most
of
these
were
in
cwindowssystem
commdrv
keyboarddrv
shelldll
etc
but
also
cwindowsprogmanexe
and
a
couple
of
files
in
the
ctape
directory
anyone
else
had
this
happen
this
is
because
the
files
are
opened
by
dos
the
files
in
the
tape
directory
are
likely
the
executable
file
or
the
configuration
file
for
the
tape
system
i
would
recommend
running
the
backup
from
dos
so
it
will
make
a
complete
backup
of
the
tape
directory
thanks
for
any
and
all
feedback
on
this
system
id
also
appreciate
hearing
of
good
sources
for
blank
tape
cartridges
preferably
mb
size
the
cartridges
wont
do
you
any
good
since
the
drive
wont
write
of
physical
data
on
the

these

i

the

for

i
wont
argue
that
the

for

good

i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better

ide
on
an

when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard

well
scsi
is
also
a
floppy
drive
interface
in
the
mac
since
scsi
is
the
inteface
for
any
noncard
nonmodem
notkeyboard
device
the
id
is
used
for
the
floppy

called
cpu

this
allows
cross

interfacing
as
fast
as
the

scsi

can
handle

shows
up
best
in

in

this

scsi

and
ide
is
a
master
of

this
alone
puts
scsi
above
ide
blows
ide
out
of

remember
scsi
was
used
in
high

machines
until
about
months

when
the

prices
came
down

the

seems

computer

at

and
this
more
than
anything
else
proably
kept
scsi
off

price

scsi
came
from

with

os
were
the

re
joystick
suggestions
it
depends
on
what
youd
like
your
joystick
for
ive
seen
gravis
joysticks
at
radio
shack
they
seemed
flimsy
and
didnt
fit
well
in
my
hand
i
have
heard
on
csipgames
that
they
dont
last
well
less
than
a
year
on
flightsims
one
redeeming
feature
does
seem
to
be
the
ability
to
adjust
the
tension
of
the
stick
i
recently
purchased
a
ch
flightstick
there
arent
any
suction
cups
and
no
tension
adjusters
but
otherwise
it
seems
to
be
an
excellent
joystick
im
currently
using
it
for
the
wing
commander
series
and
red
baron
works
quite
well
the
large
base
does
not
require
a
steadying
hand
and
so
leaves
it
free
the
buttons
provide
good
tactile
response
you
can
hear
and
feel
them
well
there
are
other
models
made
by
ch
that
can
go
up
or
down
in
features
for
price
comparison
gravis
analogue
joysticks
sell
for
here
compared
to
the
i
paid
for
a
ch
flightstick
i
think
the
extra
is
worth
it
just
in
feel
best
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
a
salesperson
to
let
you
try
them
out
or
at
least
feel
it
before
you
buy
just
another
note
analogue
joysticks
are
best
for
flightsims
or
something
that
needs
sensitive
touch
if
youre
only
playing
games
such
as
castle
wolfenstein
or
some
other
game
that
only
uses
digital
input
ie
only
up
down
left
etc
instead
of
how
much
right
you
might
want

look

look

disk

to

if
you
follow
the
instructions
youll
notice
that
youll
need
to
use

this
is
the
default
setup
youll
also
notice

your

much

make

i
believe
that
the

automatically
adds
this

to

im
not

if
this
doesnt

you
probably
dont

once
you

the
chances
are
that
your

if
its
not
its
probably
because
you
happen
to
be

congratulations
this
appears
to
be

you
are
very
lucky
whether
your
luck
will
hold
out
remains
to
be
seen
if
your
system
is
running
much
slower
than
before
this
is
almost
definitely
caused
by
smartdrive
with
doublebuffering
according
to
the
windows

and
the
microsoft
technical
note
smartdrive
double
buffering
required
with

must
use

with

disable
doublebuffering
if
you
do
windows
in
enhanced
mode
will
not
work
and
you
might
even
destroy
the
contents
of
your
hard
disk
by
trying
to
run
windows
what
you
can
do
is
one
of
the
following
use
other
drivers
that
provide
doublebuffering
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
unbelievable
slowness
in
smartdrive
is
caused
either
by
horribly
inefficient
doublebuffering
or
by
a
bug
in
smartdrive
use
a
driver
that
provides
vds
services
vds
stands
for
virtual
dma
services
this
is
a
standard
which
is
supported
by
windows
that
allows
busmastering
disk
controllers
like
the
to
work
with
windows
after
trashing
my
hard
disk
countless
times
i
found
the
following
solutions
none
of
which
require
using
smartdrive
note
however
that
i
am
now
getting
occasional
parity
errors
which
are
probably
not
caused
by
these
solutions
but
might
be
see
below
while
the
following
does
not
require
smartdrive
using
some
kind
of
disk
cache
utility
is
strongly
recommended
as
this
makes
windows
run
much
much
faster
if
you
do
not
have
the
driver
or
you
do
not
need
aspi
functions
for
controlling
a
cdrom
tape
drive
more
than
two
physical
hard
disks
etc
you
can
add
the
scsihasys
driver
to
your
configsys
file
eg
drivercscsihasys
windows
needs
the
option
this
driver
must
be
loaded
into
low
memory
it
cannot
be
loaded
into
high
memory
and
it
occupies
about
as
of
november
the
scsihasys
driver
could
be
obtained
from
the
adaptec
bbs
at
hopefully
its
still
there
if
you
need
aspi
functions
and
have
the
driver
version
or
you
can
use
both
the
and
scsihasys
drivers
in
your
configsys
file
eg
drivercscsihasys
amazingly
enough
the
scsihasys
driver
can
also
be
loaded
high
assuming
you
have
dos
i
would
have
thought
that
this
would
crash
my
system
but
it
doesnt
i
asked
adaptecs
technical
support
about
this
and
they
said
that
loading
scsihasys
high
should
be
fine
as
long
as
is
loaded
low
on
my
system
not
using
scsihasys
with
would
occasionally
cause
windows
to
crash
upon
restarting
or
exiting
windows
with
the
additional
result
of
a
corrupted
disk
some
of
my
cwindowsgrp
files
would
be
corrupted
for
me
these
crashes
usually
occurred
while
making
a
different
program
from
progmanexe
the
default
windows
shell
and
viceversa
this
is
the
reason
scsihasys
may
be
necessary
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
if
scsihasys
is
necessary
with
versions
of
earlier
than
note
that
many
people
can
use
or
without
scsihasys
they
do
not
seem
to
have
any
problems
at
all
i
consider
these
people
lucky
others
like
me
have
had
all
sorts
of
problems
in
my
opinion
the
best
but
not
necessarily
the
easiest
solution
is
to
upgrade
to
the
scsihasys
driver
is
no
longer
needed
unfortunately
while
you
could
get
previous
upgrades
from
the
adaptec
bbs
the
driver
is
not
available
from
the
adaptec
bbs
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
only
three
ways
to
get
a
copy
you
can
buy
the
new
as
of
november
adaptec
ez
scsi
driver
kit
which
supposedly
includes
as
well
as
other
drivers
such
as
cdrom
drivers
i
believe
the
list
price
is
around
if
you
already
have
a
copy
of
an
older
version
of
you
can
supposedly
contact
adaptec
to
upgrade
it
to
ez
scsi
for
around
a
copy
of
is
included
in
central
point
pc
tools
for
msdos
note
that
the
documentation
and
driver
are
stored
in
different
directories
note
further
that
only
is
included
the
cdrom
drivers
and
drivers
to
support
more
than
two
hard
disks
are
not
included
this
is
where
i
obtained
my
copy
of
note
however
that
i
am
now
getting
occasional
parity
errors
with
windows
in
all
probability
defective
hardware
in
my
pc
is
causing
this
as
i
upgraded
my
motherboard
just
after
i
found
the
above
solutions
however
because
these
parity
errors
occur
only
during
disk
accesses
there
is
a
very
small
but
definite
possibility
that
the
parity
errors
are
driverrelated
for
example
changing
the
bus
onoff
timing
for
certain
disk
transfers
might
cause
this
ive
run
various
memory
tests
for
hours
at
a
time
and
these
tests
have
found
no
problems
this
problem
is
probably
caused
by
memory
with
marginal
timing
requirements
which
cause
parity
errors
during
disk
transfers
this
is
why
the
memory
tests
didnt
find
any
problems
the
problems
show
up
only
under
disk
io
however
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
devices
there
are
two
possible
problems
with
using
the
adaptec
with
a
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
device
such
as
the
colorado
memory
systems
jumbo
tape
backupsrestores
can
take
a
very
long
time
the
tape
drive
constantly
starts
stops
starts
stops
etc
tape
operations
may
be
erratic
or
encounter
too
many
tape
errors
this
problem
might
be
caused
by
defective
hardware
on
my
however
ive
heard
of
other
people
having
similar
problems
and
so
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
is
not
a
hardware
problem
on
my
tape
backupsrestores
take
a
long
time
if
you
have
a
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
device
you
may
have
to
adjust
the
adaptec
bus
onoff
timing
for
best
results
when
using
the
tape
drive
normally
while
doing
a
tape
backup
or
restore
the
tape
drive
motor
should
be
continuously
running
with
only
an
occasional
pause
however
the
default
bus
timing
on
the
adaptec
may
cause
the
tape
drive
motor
to
start
and
stop
start
and
stop
every
few
seconds
this
causes
needless
wear
to
the
tape
and
tape
drive
however
note
that
a
dirty
tape
head
or
a
defective
tape
drive
can
also
cause
this
make
sure
your
tape
heads
are
clean
this
also
causes
the
tape
backup
or
restore
to
take
much
much
longer
than
necessary
the
problem
here
is
that
these
tape
backups
use
the
floppy
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memory
tofrom
the
tape
drive
and
the
adaptec
uses
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memory
tofrom
the
hard
disk
the
floppy
dma
needs
to
feed
data
to
the
tape
drive
at
a
certain
rate
if
the
tape
drive
is
not
fed
data
quickly
enough
by
the
floppy
dma
the
tape
drive
stops
rewinds
a
bit
and
restarts
once
enough
data
is
eventually
fed
to
it
the
default
bus
timing
on
the
adaptec
which
is
really
dma
timing
is
too
large
for
example
when
a
backup
is
done
data
has
to
be
transferred
from
a
hard
disk
to
memory
and
then
from
memory
to
the
tape
because
the
default
timing
on
the
adaptec
hogs
the
memory
too
much
too
much
time
is
spent
transferring
data
from
a
hard
disk
to
memory
not
enough
time
is
spent
transferring
data
from
memory
to
the
tape
drive
as
a
result
the
tape
drive
constantly
starts
and
stops
because
data
is
not
fed
to
it
quickly
enough
the
solution
is
to
change
the
adaptecs
bus
onoff
timing
the
default
factory
setting
is
microseconds
on
and
microseconds
off
the
bus
on
timing
needs
to
be
lowered
to
microseconds
this
can
be
done
in
one
of
two
ways
if
you
have
you
can
use
the
n
option
for
example
i
use
a
bus
on
timing
of
microseconds
which
means
that
i
use
the
following
line
in
my
configsys
file
note
that
there
is
no
space
between
the
n
and
the
if
you
dont
have
your
only
recourse
is
to
try
to
find
a
program
called
setscsiexe
which
is
very
difficult
to
find
the
reason
is
that
adaptec
for
reasons
of
their
own
does
not
seem
to
want
this
widely
distributed
i
once
asked
someone
who
worked
for
adaptec
and
they
asked
me
to
not
upload
it
anywhere
if
you
have
anonymous
ftp
access
to
the
internet
you
could
try
using
archie
to
hunt
down
a
copy
i
believe
that
there
are
a
couple
of
sites
that
have
it
if
you
do
find
a
copy
you
run
it
like
so
setscsi
this
adjusts
the
bus
on
timing
to
microseconds
running
setscsiexe
without
any
arguments
resets
the
bus
timing
back
to
the
factory
defaults
note
that
it
seems
that
you
cannot
use
setscsiexe
if
you
use
setscsiexe
crashed
my
system
if
was
loaded
i
could
use
setscsiexe
with
scsihasys
however
do
not
lower
the
bus
on
timing
below
microseconds
or
increase
it
above
microseconds
if
you
lower
it
too
low
the
hard
disk
throughput
will
suddenly
drop
your
system
will
feel
slower
for
me
microseconds
works
fine
this
value
may
work
fine
for
you
or
you
may
have
to
adjust
it
downwards
a
little
once
youve
lowered
the
bus
on
timing
tape
backups
and
restores
should
run
faster
also
do
not
experiment
with
the
bus
onoff
times
with
the
other
options
that
i
have
intentionally
not
described
unless
you
know
what
you
are
doing
bad
combinations
can
cause
parity
errors
and
worse
by
starving
memory
refresh
a
program
called
bustifixexe
exists
on
the
adaptec
bbs
unless
this
has
been
upgraded
since
i
last
checked
which
has
been
a
while
this
is
a
selfextracting
archive
containing
a
batch
file
and
a
couple
of
other
files
this
batch
file
was
supposed
to
allow
one
to
set
the
bus
onoff
times
for
the
and
others
however
when
i
tried
running
this
program
with
my
my
system
crashed
at
the
time
i
was
running
scsihasys
and
i
didnt
check
to
see
if
there
was
a
conflict
with
it
maybe
this
old
program
works
only
with
the
although
the
docs
say
that
it
works
with
the
erratic
tape
operations
or
too
many
tape
errors
this
problem
may
or
may
not
exist
although
it
existed
on
my
system
a
hardware
problem
just
on
my
particular
could
cause
it
however
ive
heard
of
other
people
having
similar
problems
and
so
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
just
on
my
symptoms
of
this
problem
which
persists
even
after
cleaning
the
tape
head
backing
up
to
tape
encounters
unusable
sector
detected
errors
resulting
in
an
aborted
tape
backup
tape
backup
works
but
the
tape
compare
fails
the
tape
drive
starts
stops
starts
stops
etc
much
too
often
unlike
the
abovementioned
problem
tape
backupsrestores
take
a
long
time
where
the
tape
drive
starts
and
stops
every
few
seconds
this
kind
of
startingstopping
occurs
every
few
seconds
or
so
fastback
plus
does
not
findsee
any
tape
backup
devices
other
programs
like
central
point
backup
and
the
cms
jumbo
software
assuming
that
you
have
a
cms
jumbo
tape
drive
can
findsee
the
tape
drive
but
fastback
plus
cannot
too
many
tape
read
errors
although
i
do
not
know
what
is
causing
this
problem
i
discovered
that
using
a
different
floppy
controller
solves
it
a
few
months
ago
i
upgraded
my
motherboard
which
contained
an
integrated
floppy
controller
as
i
already
had
a
floppy
controller
on
the
i
initially
disabled
the
motherboard
floppy
controller
after
a
while
i
decided
to
try
disabling
the
floppy
controller
and
using
the
one
on
the
motherboard
when
i
did
this
the
tape
drive
a
cms
jumbo
reliability
increased
dramatically
and
fastback
plus
was
suddenly
able
to
find
and
use
the
tape
drive
i
dont
know
if
this
was
caused
by
a
hardware
problem
on
my
on
the
one
hand
the
floppy
drives
worked
great
when
they
were
attached
to
the
which
seems
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
on
the
other
hand
the
tape
drive
didnt
work
well
attached
to
the
floppy
controller
but
it
did
work
when
attached
to
a
different
controller
this
could
be
an
indication
of
a
hardware
problem
on
my
i
did
change
floppy
drive
cables
and
so
it
is
conceivable
that
the
problem
was
in
the
cables
i
dont
know
what
the
cause
really
is
however
if
youre
having
similar
problems
you
might
want
to
consider
trying
a
new
floppy
controller
sound
cards
many
popular
sound
cards
can
play
or
record
digitized
sound
and
this
is
typically
done
using
dma
like
the
tape
drive
dma
the
adaptecs
dma
can
conflict
with
the
sound
card
dma
unlike
that
of
the
tape
dma
this
conflict
usually
manifests
itself
as
a
parity
error
your
system
crashes
with
a
parity
error
message
what
happens
is
that
data
is
being
transferred
so
quickly
by
the
sound
card
and
the
adaptec
memory
refresh
cannot
occur
quickly
enough
which
causes
a
parity
error
usually
getting
a
parity
error
means
that
there
is
a
hardware
problem
with
your
system
in
this
case
however
the
parity
error
is
not
a
symptom
of
bad
hardware
ive
found
that
such
parity
errors
typically
occur
while
recording
digitized
sound
and
the
chances
of
such
errors
increase
as
you
increase
the
recording
fidelity
eg
higher
sampling
rate
recording
in
stereo
recording
using
instead
of
etc
like
the
tape
drive
solution
the
solution
here
is
to
lower
the
adaptecs
bus
on
timing
see
the
section
on
tape
drives
for
information
on
how
this
is
done
note
however
that
this
may
or
may
not
solve
the
problem
it
may
only
reduce
the
probability
of
a
parity
error
the
software
used
to
record
digitized
sound
can
greatly
affect
this
problem
ie
some
software
is
inefficient
disk
caches
the
speed
of
your
hard
disk
and
the
amount
of
disk
fragmentation
can
also
affect
this
miscellaneous
info
this
section
contains
miscellaneous
hints
tips
and
rumors
much
of
it
is
merely
information
that
ive
heard
or
read
about
and
have
not
verified
i
believe
that
the
following
information
is
correct
but
im
not
sure
use
it
at
your
own
risk
with
qemm
and
you
need
to
specify
the
db
parameter
eg
unless
you
are
using
the
driver
if
you
dont
qemm
will
crashhang
at
bootup
although
the
qemm
manual
mentions
this
the
install
program
does
not
seem
to
detect
that
a

present
and
automatically
add
this
option
to
the
qemm
command
line
at
least
this
occurred
with
the
qemm
install
program
i
havent
tested
any
other
version
earlier
versions
of
qemm
probably
need
this
parameter
but
im
not
sure
ive
never
used
a
version
earlier
than
if
you
use
you
do
not
need
to
give
qemm
the
db
parameter
some
or
all
versions
of
the
do
not
support
hard
disks
over
one
gigabyte
in
size
to
support
hard
disks
with
capacities
over
you
need
to
get
a
new
rom
bios
from
adaptec
im
not
sure
if
this
is
still
true
of
the
latest
being
sold
by
adaptec
to
connect
a
cdrom
drive
to
the
you
need
a
scsi
cdrom
drive
and
some
drivers
note
that
some
cdrom
drives
have
proprietary
interfaces
nonscsi
these
drives
cannot
be
used
with
the
you
have
three
choices
for
cdrom
drivers
i
have
no
idea
how
well
the
following
solutions
work
or
even
if
they
work
the
following
is
secondhand
information
you
can
buy
adaptecs
ez
scsi
driver
package
which
lists
for
something
like
if
you
already
have
older
adaptec
drivers
you
can
supposedly
upgrade
to
ez
scsi
for
around
contact
adaptec
for
details
the
ez
scsi
package
supposedly
contains
everything
that
you
need
you
can
buy
the
corelscsi
driver
package
which
is
made
by
the
same
people
that
make
coreldraw
this
package
contains
cdrom
drivers
scsi
tape
drivers
worm
drivers
etc
i
do
not
know
the
list
price
but
ive
seen
this
package
sold
for
around
note
that
corelscsi
does
not
come
with
the
driver
which
is
needed
if
you
do
not
already
have
you
may
be
better
off
getting
adaptecs
ez
scsi
instead
this
method
is
obsolete
as
the
following
drivers
have
been
obsoleted
by
adaptecs
ez
scsi
kit
but
im
mentioning
it
in
case
someone
already
has
these
drivers
you
can
use
the
drivers
in
the
adaptec
kit
and
the
kit
aspi
cdrom
drivers
you
will
have
to
get
a
copy
of
mscdexexe
a
highlevel
cdrom
driver
if
it
is
not
included
in
the
kit
but
this
is
available
from
several
bulletin
boards
to
use
a
scsi
tape
drive
with
the
you
need
software
that
knows
how
to
talk
to
a
scsi
tape
drive
software
that
ive
heard
about
are
again
like
the
above
section
on
cdrom
drives
i
have
no
idea
how
well

central

supposedly
supports
a

it

backup
the

contains

see

and
ez

including

those
people
who
use

might
be
interested
in
a
version
of

tar
for
msdos
that
talks
to
a
scsi

drive
via

you
need
this
driver
before
you
can
use
this
program
ive
never
used
this
version
of
gnu
tar
but
ive
heard
that
it
works
i
dont
know
how
well
though
if

unixforum
might

if
any

does
as
far
as
msdos
is
concerned
the
and
the

are
the
same
with
msdos
the
should
work
as
well
as
the
however
the
hardware
for
these
two
boards
is
not
identical
and
there
is
at

something

bear
in

is
what
the

v

the
origional
intention
of
the

was
to
speed
up
the

so
that

would
be
faster
this
is
espically
useful
in

not

the

the

contained

arrived

sure
enough
it
has

noticable

its
not
dramatic
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
especially
noticable
when
the

doesnt

the
fact
that
it
is
worse
on

doesnt

matters
what
im
trying

is
if
these

are

are

perfect
i
dont

does
the

consider
this

normal

ship
their

it
depends
on

support

but
not

when
the

since
the

the

slower
through

is
indeed
twice
esdi
as
the
article
pointed
out
as
for
faster
then
ide
that
seems
to
be
using
a
contoler
chip
the
mac
quadra
uses
a
controler
chip
for
its
and
gets
through
put
for
asynchronous
far
in
excess
of
a
normal
synchronous
output
of
is
which
is
near
the
burst
of
a
machine
with
a
controller
chip
the
pc
world
seems
to
have
and
mixed
up
fact
is
controler
chips
allow
near
speeds
through
a
device
as
shown
in
the
mac
quadra
which
skews
some
of
the
data
of

or
esdi
test
i
agree
that
the
article
could
have
stated
that
the
faster
then
ide
came
off
a
device
with
a
chip
maybe
it
was
there
and
the
editor
killed
it
because
the
article
was
dealing
with
not
and
he
did
not
understand
the
effect
of
a
device
with
a
controller
chip
chips
are
limited
to
max
devices
with
chips
becoming
common
produce
up
to
in
mode
and
in
mode
the
fast
version
ports
cannot
use
wide
scsi
of
cource
the
prime
piece
of
wierdness
is
that
devices
have
chips
or
more
accurately
the
machine
does
this
allows
the
best
of
both
worlds
high
speeds
and
cheeper
costs
full

port
electronic

is
very
expensive
it
also
creates
a
logistic
nightmare
as
to
how
fast
goes
when
one
knows
the
facts
behind
the
numbers
then
one
realizes
that
the

knows
what
it
is
talking
about
even
if
it
does
not
tell
how
the
figures
came
about
while

throwing
out

inconsiant
about

which
though
it

that

an

said
it

not

it

is
maximum

what

either
good

really
noticable
im

will
the

be
noticed
for
these
if
you
are
talking
about
laser
jet
then
i
believe
it
has
to
be
postscript
i
dont
see
any
advantage
to
using
pcl
when
you
have
a
peice
of
hardware
plugged
into
the
that
is
doing
the
work
and
it
can
support
any
language
that
is
suited
for
the
job
besides
i
dont
think
pcl
is
even
capable
of
handling
dpi
specifications
i
only
have
experience
with
the
laser
master
winjet
which
brings
the
up
to
dpi
and
it
uses
postscript
it
also
has
a
fast
print
mode
which
is
not
postscript
and
it
is
at
a
lower
resolution
i
think
but
it
is
fast
this
particular
product
uses
your
host
processor
to
process
the
postscript
so
even
with
a
decent
pc
you
know
its
going
to
be
slow
ie
slow
compared
to
a
highend
workstation
processed
ps
the
quality
difference
is
very
noticable
and
is
almost
worth
the
wait
for
the
ps
processing
im
rather
impatient
we
were
using
it
for
bw
camera
images
the
gray
scale
image
was
accepted
by
ms
word
and
handed
to
the
winjet
ps
printer
driver
which
converts
the
image
into
postscript
and
then
hands
it
off
to
the
winjets
postscript
processor
the
postscript
is
rendered
into
ram
lots
of
it
and
when
it
is
done
it
shoots
it
directly
to
the
printer
the
ps
processor
can
also
accept
ps
files
created
from
other
sources
including
dos
applications
but
windows
has
to
be
running
at
the
time
of
printing
the
ps
processor
is
responsible
for
the
halftoning
and
id
say
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
our

came
out
very
good
in
my
opinion
not
as
good
as

i
am
looking
at
purchasing
a

from
zeos
computers
i
would
appreciate
if
people
could
give
me
some
feedback
about
the
quality
of
their
products
and
customer
service
along
with
any
advice
about
which

people
like
thanks
in

i
bought
a
system
a
little
over
years
ago
and
was
satisfied
with
everything
about
zeos
that
computer
went
off
to
grad
school
with
my
son
and
i
replaced
it
with
a
pkg
mbhd
ram
with
diamond
viper
level
cache
and
tower
upgrades
delete
the
ctx
monitor
i
got
a
hp
monitor
employee
purchase
this
is
a
great
system
fast
quiet
solidly
built
not
a
single
glitch
bringing
it
up
tech
support
seems
busier
now
than
years
ago
i
called
with
a
configuration
question
and
they
called
back
hours
later
with
the
right
answer
i
think
theres
a
slight
premium
over
gateway
prices
but
imho
zeos
is
worth
it
btw
they
have
enough
lines
that
ive
never
gotten
a
busy
signal
calling
sales
customer
service
or
tech
support
now
you
usually
wait
or
minutes
to
talk
to
someone
but
at
least
you
get
in

orchid
vs
fahrenheit
mini
review
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
and
and
orchid
in
short
i
am
happy
with
the
monitor
and
unhappy
with
the
card
i
have
spent
a
lot
more
time
futzing
with
the
card
so
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
write
about
the
monitor
is
pretty
the
moires
i
had
under
simcity
on
my
magnavox
went
away
it
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
lbs
i
think
so
much
for
the
monitor
on
to
the
bitch
session
and
test
results
in
going
with
the
modern
trend
the
orchid
card
only
supports
colors
in
mode
without
a
driver
of
course
this
breaks
any
dos
program
which
uses
svga
modes
like
most
of
my
cdroms
the
compudyne
whiplash
vga
orchid
fahrenheit
and
orchid
f
vlb
all
share
this
limitation
those
are
all
cards
which
means
it
is
an
problem
for
them
the
uses
a
weitek
vga
chip
which
also
doesnt
support
them
the
hercules
graphite
card
does
seem
to
have
these
modes
but
i
didnt
run
the
same
test
cases
as
i
did
on
the
other
boards
during
the
brief
time
i
had
it
it
was
able
to
print
the
splash
screen
for
the
groliers
encyclopedia
though
which
the
cards
just
printed
as
hash
which
is
why
i
suspect
the
svga
modes
are
supported
the
supported
resolutions
really
annoy
me
you
can
do
at
if
you
tell
the
driver
you
have
an
nec
they
only
have
about
six
monitors
listed
plus
generic
and
if
you
choose
generic
you
cant
get
any
high
refreshes
at
all
but
at
you
are
limited
to
seems
to
me
that
the
hardware
should
be
able
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
at
it
sure
should
be
able
to
do
it
at
higher
vertical
resolution
was
the
main
reason
i
bought
the
card
over
the
orchid
f
vlb
i
currently
have
and
it
will
do
hz
as
well
the
higher
graphics
modes
all
crash
hp
dashboard
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
orchid
and
with
the
drivers
i
dont
know
what
i
have
he
was
unable
to
recreate
the
problem
on
the
plus
side
their
tech
rep
was
as
helpful
as
he
could
be
and
booted
up
the
program
on
his
computer
to
verify
he
didnt
have
the
problem
he
didnt
know
why
they
limited
the
refresh
to
hz
either
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
things
according
to
the
hercules
speedy
program
this
program
tests
various
operations
and
reports
the
results
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
the
graphite
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
was
running
in
a
isa
so
the
numbers
arent
really
comparable
the
following
numbers
were
all
obtained
using
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memory
i
give
ranges
because
the
program
reports
the
numbers
as
it
computes
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
k
means
thousand
not
m
means

i

as

go
the

takes
the

and

my

is
after
it

been
rasterized
into
a

that
can
just
be

awesome
interestingly
the

show
no

and
hatched
polygons
ie
filled
with
crosshatching
and

whatever
they
are
graphics
operations
like
xors
maybe
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
give
two

for

because
i
think
they
are
caching
when
the
fonts
are

drawn
on

they
are
done
fairly
slowly
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increases
dramatically
sounds
like
programming
to
a
benchmark
to
me
i
make
no
claims
that
these
numbers
mean
anything
at

its
just

read
the

that

reads
in

you
send

the

read
it

you
time
how
long
it
takes
for
the

port
to
set
a

this

is
proportional

adaptec

about

at

this
seemed
the

the

i
had
with

said
that
this
is
the
driver
to
be
used
with
cdrom
drives
since
then
i
have
learn
that
this
driver
is
out

in
a
major
way
and
that
adaptec
have
an
upgrade
deal
for
going
to
the
next
driver
i
think
its
called
eziscsi
or
something
i
wasnt
too
fussed
about
this
until
i
upgraded
by
cdrom
drive
from
a
sony
to
a

i
now
find
that
the
audiomode
will
not
work
i
assume
it
is
not

correctly
by

so
should
i
chase

so

help
installing

recently
my

got
a
second
internal
ide
drive
a
seagate
i
can
look
up
the
model
number
if
its
important
and
ive
been
trying
to
help
him
install
it
ive
got
a
vested

since
my
machines
busted
and
i
have
to
use
his
until
i
get
mine
fixed
he
already
has
a
seagate
ide
hd
again
i
forget
the
model
number
but
i
can
find
out
anyway
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
bloody
thing
up
ive
managed
to
get
one
or
the
other
drive
up
with
the
other
disconnected
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
whenever
i
try
the
thing
hangs
during
bootup
never
gets
past
the
system
test
the
ide
controllers
instruction
sheet
says
it
supports
two
drives
i
think
ive
configured
the
cmos
correctly
the
powers
plugged
in
properly
i
even
learned
about
the
masterslave
relationship
that
two
hds
are
supposed
to
have
didnt
know
pcs
were
into
sm
and
i
think
i
configured
the
jumpers
properly
the
one
is
the
master
the
new
one
is
the
slave
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
maybe
im
doing
the
cabling
wrong
ive
tried
several
combinations
controller
master
slave
controller
slave
master
master
controller
slave
none
of
them
worked
unfortunately
i
cant
think
of
any
others
another
possibility
is
that
the
one
is
already
partitioned
into
two
seperate
drives
c
and
d
and
the
cmos
asks
for
c
drive
and
d
drive
setup
info
rather
than
drive
and
drive
like
most
others
ive
seen
could
this
be
confusing
things
so
i
need
help
the
drive
came
bereft
of
any
docs
except
for
some
info
for
the
cmos
setup
the
controller
has
a
little
piece
of
paper
about
the
size
of
an
index

i
cannibalized
the
cable
its
one
of
those
with
a

at

end
and
the

in

it

an

not

it

is
slower

see
something
is

i
agree
theres
a

intels
spec
is
vlbus
it
not
good
for
much
more
than
vga
cards
to
each
his
own
ill
laugh
when
you
start
crying
over
how
much
you
spent
for
your
little
ide
drives
and
then
finding
out
you
need
more
space
the
biggest
advantage
of
scsi
right
now
is
that
you
can
add
more
different
kinds
of
devices
such
as
tapes
etc
easily
and
can
add
bigger
disks
the
best
and
most
cost
effective
hard
disks
available
are
scsi
here
here
only
of
you
need
drives
larger
then
meg
oh
yes
gotta
have
megssec
transfer
rate
for
those
speedy
tape
backups
and
cd
rom

dont
stick
your
foot
in
your

when
you
make

statement
you
know
nothing
about

rather
wait
a
second
compared
to
the
minutes
and
ide
would
take
obviously
exaggerated
have
you
ever
tried
to
backup
gigs
of
disk
oh
i
forgot
you
cant
because
you
have
an
ide
and
no
one
makes
ide
disks
that
big
basically
if
a
person
has
to
ask
which
one
is
better
for
himher
then
they
will
probably
never
see
the
expensive
benefits
from
scsi
i
guess
you
probably
bought
a
too
also
all
this
armwaving
about
scsi
expandability
is
a
moot
point
if
the
user
only
has
one
or
two
drives
on
it
and
with
scsi
those
two
drives
may
be
fast
but
that
speed
is
only
due
to
the
onboard
memory
cache
something
i
can
duplicate
with
a
caching
ide
controller
what
the
fastwide
spec
has
much
more
bandwidth
than
any
stupid
vlbus
ide
crap
stop
this
thread
now
its
just
cluttering
up
bandwidth
if
you
want
to
read
about
scsi
vs
ide
just
pay
a
visit
to
you
local
usenet
archive
the
best
fastwideetc
is
clearly
faster
than
any
the
best
ide
drive
all
the
response
given
are
based
upon
personal
experience
with
or
drives
you
cant
judge
such
completely
different
interfaces
ide
has
the
low
cost
adavantage
a
descent
performance
scsi
has
the
ability
for
super
high
capacity
expandibility
and
speed
neither
one
is
better

turbo

had

only

so

does
anyone
know
a

this
do
i
need

what
is
the

this

is
somewhat
frustrating
i
got
it
to
work
somehow
but
my
turbo
switch
doesnt
work
at
all
i
just
put
replaced
the
motherboard
in
a
system
and
had
similar
questions
my
cents
worth
the
speaker
connector
should
have
two
wires
going
to
the
speaker
a
speaker
being
a
coil
its
bidirectional
and
makes
no
difference
which
way
you
attach
turbo
switch
there
are
three
wires
to
control
how
you
want
turbo
to
become
active
with
the
switch
pushed
in
or
the
switch
out
i
think
the
middle
wire
is
common
use
an
ohm
meter
to
figure
out
which
wire
connects
with
the
common
wire
when
the
switch
is
pushed
in
and
which
two
wires
are
connected
when
the
switch
is
out
place
the
appropriate
two
wires
on
the
turbo
berg
connector
of
the
motherboard
leds
turbo
and
hd
leds
are
uni
directional
depending
which
way
the
wires
are
attached
the
led
will
not
light
on
my
ami
motherboard
if
the
turbo
switch
wires
are
not
attached
to
the
berg
connector
on
the
board
the
board
will
power
up
in
default
in
turbo
mode
if
your
motherboard
is
like
that
just
attace
the
led
wires
to
the
board
if
the
led
doesnt
light
power
off
reverse
the
connectors
and
try
again
it
should
work
if
it
does
then
attach
the

to

hope

why
does
scsi

when

multi
tasking

is
data
and
it

be
anywhere
on

can
scsi

faster
can
it
get
it
off

into

faster
does
it
have
a

system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single

explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the

first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in

face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
said
isa
was
necessary
eisa
or
vlb
are
the
only
interfaces
worth
investing
thousands
of
dollars
eg
a
new
pcs
worth
of
money
in
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
you
didnt
read
to
carefully
vlbide
uses
the
same
connection
mechanism
as
standard
ide
if
transfer
rate
is
limited
by
ide
whether
its
interfaced
to
isa
eisa
or
vlb
matters
not
so
at
its
lowest
setting
interface
in
asynchronous
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
as
implimented
on
what
system
on
mine
for
one
thing
scsi
blows
ide
out
of
the
water
hands
down
if
ide
has
better
throughput
why
isnt
it
used
on
workstations
and
file
servers
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
through
put
given
the
original
question
scsi
used
only
as
a
single
hard
drive
controller
is
it
then
necessary
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at

maybe
megssec

the

to
make

what
does
a
meg
megssec
scsi

cost
no
thats
the
nice
thing
on
a
multitasking
os
scsi
can
use
both
drives
at
once
ive
got
unix
loaded
on
one
of

along
with

i
just

i
paid

i
havent

cheaper
the
original
cga
cart
back
in
was
i
think
the
original
ega
card
or
pga
was
scsi
has
stood
relatively
alone
in
not
coming
down
in
price
mainly
because
were
talking
about
pcs
and
not
suns
or
sparc
or
sgi
or
name
your
favorite
unix
workstation
that
is
after
millions
of
pc
buying
decisions
over
the
years
scsi
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
come
down
in
price
no
actually
were
talking
about
scsi
being
expensive
simply
because
nobody
did
a
common
interface
for
the
pc
if
they
had
a
common
read
easily
implemented
method
of
adding
scsi
to
a
pc
like
as
in
a
sun
or
mac
then
youd
find
scsi
the
connection
medium
of
choice
i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
single
drive
scsi
is
more
expensive
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expandibility
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drives
or
whatever
the
following
are
why
i
find
scsi
intrinsically
better
than
ide
a
partial
list
you
can
add
many
different
types
of
devices
and
access
them
concurrently
a
scsi
device
works
on
many
different
machines
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
moving
hard
drives
between
them
is
very
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
scsi
devices
work
together
better
than
ide
devices
for
instance
recently
i
added
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
as
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termination
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goes
i
have
a
problem
with
ides
mutual
exclusion
i
notice
that
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
accessing
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quite
long
as
compared
to
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitasking
os
this
is
very
noticable
as
many
things
can
be
going
on
at
once
one
neat
thing
that
ive
noticed
lately
a
fringe
benefit
has
been
the
ability
to
add
older
almost
dead
drives
as
storage
on
a
scsi
system
with
little
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg
drives
that
ive
added
to
my

ive
now
got
the

it
does
allow
me
to
have
meg
drives
meg
drive
tape
drive

this

the

megsec
transfer
on
his
does
your
figure
include
a
few
hundred
for
scsi
drivers
no
actually
were
talking
about
scsi
being
expensive
simply
because
nobody
did
a
common
interface
for
the
pc
if
they
had
a
common
read
easily
implemented
method
of
adding
scsi
to
a
pc
like
as
in
a
sun
or
mac
then
youd
find
scsi
the
connection
medium
of
choice
so
youre
saying
that
scsi
would
have
been
the
default
interface
type
considering
that
the
vast
majority
of
pcs
dont
have
cdrom
drives
or
tape
backups
or
etc
that
most
pcs
only
have
or
had
hard
drive
and
run
dos
that
scsi
hard
drives
cost
a
lot
more
than
mfm
or
rll
drives
at
the
time
and
how
common
were
scsi
drives
under
megs
to
years
ago
theres
a
lot
more
than
the
lack
of
a
common
interface
card
that
prevented
scsi
from
becoming
the
connection
medium
of
choice
i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
single
drive
scsi
is
more
expensive
but
on
that
point
is
it
faster
this
is
what
all
this
is
about
do
you
get
more
performance
for
the
money
for
all
the
people
that
will
only
have
a
single
hard
drive
in
their
system
regardless
of
the
os
will
the
scsi
choice
really
give
them
more
performance
than
ide
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expandibility
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drives
or
whatever
true
but
expandibility
can
also
start
on
the
bus
which
means
the
option
is
there
for
cdrom
drives
or
tape
backups
that
run
off
their
own
cards
you
can
add
many
different
types
of
devices
and
access
them
concurrently
no
argument
this
is
always
held
up
to
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
as
the
best
reason
but
how
many
scsi
devices
will
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
eventually
acquire
again
does
it
make
sense
to
go
scsi
for
a
single
hard
drive
system
a
scsi
device
works
on
many
different
machines
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
moving
hard
drives
between
them
is
very
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
with
all
the
postings
on
the
scsi
i
or
ii
specs
are
you
really
sure
that
pc
and
apple
scsi
hard
drives
are
compatible
and
even
if
they
are
is
the
data
accessible
from
either
machine
ie
are
there
no
formatting
partitioning
or
file
table
differences
is
it
really
plugnplay
scsi
devices
work
together
better
than
ide
devices
for
instance
recently
i
added
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
as
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termination
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goes
so
the
c
drive
on
the
connor
becomes
a
logical
d
drive
to
dos
is
this
really
a
problem
i
have
a
problem
with
ides
mutual
exclusion
i
notice
that
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
accessing
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quite
long
as
compared
to
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitasking
os
this
is
very
noticable
as
many
things
can
be
going
on
at
once
after
having
two
ide
drives
in
my
system
for
temporary
file
transfers
i
have
never
seen
any
differences
when
switching
between
drives
nor
have
i
ever
seen
any
differences
when
transfering
files
between
drives
or
tofrom
the
same
drive
one
neat
thing
that
ive
noticed
lately
a
fringe
benefit
has
been
the
ability
to
add
older
almost
dead
drives
as
storage
on
a
scsi
system
with
little
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg
drives
that
ive
added
to
my
pc
ive
now
got
the
interface
full
but
it
does
allow
me
to
have
meg
drives
meg
drive
tape
drive
and
meg
drive
all
on
the
same
card
that
is
nice
as
long
as
the

supply
can

i
do
believe
that
there
is
the
possibility
for
up

simply
put

handier

help
with
decision
im
buying
a
new
system
this
week
to
replace
my
brain
dead
and
could
use
some
feedback
on
a
couple
systems
im
looking
at
if
anyone
is
familiar
with
them
the
system
that
looks
the
most
interesting
is
the
budget
vlb
tower
for
about
delivered
it
offers
vlb
ide
a
mitsumi
cdrom
with
software
bundle
media
vision
sound
board
ctx
cache
and
the
usual
drives
ports
os
software
since
my
budget
is
for
a
system
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
which
may
mean
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
of
course
among
other
things
ive
never
seen
a
review
of
the
budget
systems
or
their
parent
company
micro
smart
or
of
the
motherboard
they
are
using
the
aetana
any
feedback
would
be
appreciated
in
a
similar
vein
the
second
system
im
considering
midwest
micros
elite
vesa
tower
with
a
diamond
viper
midwest
micro
mi
monitor
is
one
ive
never
seen
reviewed
anywhere
im
familiar
with
the
firm
but
not
the
product
line
and
some
idea
of
their
quality
would
be
abig
benefit
here
as
well
any
other
suggestions
in
the
price
range
would
be
appreciated
my
greatest
needs
are
speed

this

on

there

one
problem
is
the
inconsitant
use

by
people
its
proper

is
the

look
at

april
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fast
as
esdi
this
is
asynchronous
with
a
chip
faster
than
ide
this
is
both
asynchronous
with
a

and
to
read
consitantly
the
quote
should
read
asynchronous

asynchronous

twice
as

the
nonuse

this
eliminates
ambaguity

somewhat
reasonable
while

expansive

so
since

have
an

if

adaptec
so
you
add

to

boot

rem

it

ibm
nicely
copies

so
rem

once
more

reboot
if
you
have
everything
in

right

it
will
work
things
are
pretty
smooth
through
the
rest
of

except
will
try
to
install

once

at

so
you
are
off
to
more

and
more
fun
the
bt
comes
with

and
costs
the
same
as
the
adaptec
cards
that
do
not
come
with

the
dos
drivers
work
great
this
card
can
easily
be
configured
to
work
with
different
sets
of
io
ports
and
you
can
use
multiple
host
adapters
in
one
machine
if
you
get
a

it
will
also
be

this
is
both

and
pc
magazine
april
the
article
is
confused
not
scsi
the
term
is
a
mess
from
inconsitant
use
not
because
the
interface
itself
is
a
mess
scsi
means
the
set
of
scsi
interfaces
composed
of
and
not
as
some
people
want
to
use
it
to
read
consitantly
the
quote
should
read
asynchronous
with
a
chip
although
asynchronous
is
twice
as

esdi
one

note
the
nonuse
of

this

state
clearly
which
scsi
you
are
talking
about

scsi
over

lumping
everything
into
scsi
as
is
sloppy
wrong
and
dumb
inconsitant
and
usage
is
also
a
problem
clean
it
up
now
or
have
a
mess
like
svga
was
several
years
ago
because
everybody
and
his

slapped

im
using

read
my

it

hideously
slow
something
like
of

being

the
joystick
and
this
is
in
a
program
that
does
nothing

printf

if
you
only
do

then
there
is
no
reason
for
the
joystick
stuff
not
to
take
of
the
time
even
if
it
is
efficient
the
problem
is
that
a

of
programs
trap
like
smartdrv
and
so
it
is
a
slow
as
hell
interface
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reasonably
safe
fashion
via
polling
and
that
isnt
platform
or
clockspeed
specific
the
truth
is
that
int
joystick
reading
is
slow
i
read
it
directly
from
the
hardware
port
note
that
doing
so
exposes
you
to
intermittent
disturbance
from
interrupts
so
you
may
want
to
read
say
twice
in
a
row
and
keep
the
lower
results
dont
just
turn
interrupts
off
it
may
prove
detrimental

the
health
of
any
high

we

plague
us
for
months
on
our

i
finally
got
tired
of
it
so
i
permanently
interchanged
the
drives
the
only
reason
i
didnt
do
it
in
the
first
place
was
because
i
had
several
bootable
and
some
based
install
disks
which
expected
the
a

i
order
all
new
software
and
upgrades
to
be
and
the
number
of
stupid
install
programs
that
cant
handle
an
alternate
drive
are
declining
with
time
the
ones
i
had
are
now
upgraded
and
as
for
the
bootable
i
just
cut
replacements

switching
the
drives
is
not
an
option
you
might
be
able
to
wire
up

chasis
i
havent
tried
it
but
i
think
it
would
work
as
long
as
it
is
wired
carefully
i
did
this
i
use
a

instead
of
a

this
way
if
the

breaks
my

there
is
a
simple
answer
if
my

serves
me
the
scsi
bios
will
only
work
as
the
first
or
second
drive
any
builtin
drives
eg
ide
are
installed
first
and
then
when
the
scsi
bios
runs
it
will
try
to
install
as
the
next
drive
but
if
there
are
already
two
drives
then
no
can
do
the
solution
is
simple
use
the
device
driver
and
disable
the
scsi

as
it
is
useless
in

it
works

there
is
a
way
in
which
a
multitasking
computer
actually
gives
you
more
cpu
power
then
you
had
before
and
that
is
with
io
overlap
with
io
overlap
your
cpu
can
continue
to
think
while
disk
operations
are
underway
whereas
without
overlap
your
cpu
sits
idly
waiting
for
each
disk
operation
to
finish
and
disk
operations
take
an
eternity
compared
to
a
fast
cpu
so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no

it

anywhere
on

can

faster
does
it
have

system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing

data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
the
adaptec
use
bus
mastering
this
means
that
the
cpu
doesnt
sit
waiting
for
data
bytes
it
can
go
off
and
do
other
computing
if
you
have
an
advanced
multitasking
os
that
is
dos
just
sits

waits
anyway
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium

drives
can
have
more

one

transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet

first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
ide
was
designed
to
plug
into
isa
virtually
unaided
in
essence
ide
is
isa
on
a
ribbon
cable
therefore
its
specs
are
the
same
as
isa
clock
bit
width
this
is
why
ive
concluded
that
ide
on
vlbus
is
a
waste
of
a
fast
slot
the

job
would
to
slow
the
vlbus

to

oss
when
managing
data
from
a

scsi
hard

a
scsi
controller
that
transfers

by
dma
allows
the

to
request

from

and
continue
working
while
the
controller
gets
the

moves

ide
also
uses
dma
techniques
i
believe
floppy
controller
also
uses
dma
and
most
ad

also
use
dma
dma
is
no
big
deal
and
has
nothing
to
do
directly
with
scsi
ide
does
not
do
dma
this
is
because
its
like
te
pc
at
hard

interface
the
controller
moves
a
sector
to
some
buffer
memory
on
the
controller
card
then
the
cpu
moves
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
main
memory
where
its
needed
if
ide
doesnt
work
this
way
then
its
not

heck
if
ide
used
dma
then
youd
hear
all
kinds
of
complaints
about
isa
bus
systems
with
more
than
ram
not
working
with
their
ide
drives
is
the
dma
addressing

of
the
isa

and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
trouble
btw
there
are
dmaenabling

in
the

spec
but
the
last
report
i

ive
been
intently
following
the
mag
thread
while
waiting
for
mine
to
arrive
in
the
mail
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
complaints
about
minor
alignment
problems
with
the
one
article
contained
a
comment
that
the
owner
called
the
factory
and
was
told
that
his
screen
rotation
was
within
spec
that
figure
for
image
rotation
would
seem
to
be
a
little
high
on
my
nec
the
specs
call
for
no
greater
than
well
my
monitor
arrived
last
night
and
sure
enough
it
has
a
very
noticable
barrel
distortion
its
not
dramatic
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
especially
noticable
when
the
image
doesnt
fill
the
entire
screen
the
fact
that
it
is
worse
on
the
right
side
doesnt
help
matters
what
im
trying
to
find
out
is
if
these
minor
imperfections
are
the
norm
or
are
most
of
their
monitors
perfect
i
dont
want
to
send
it
back
and
get
one
with
the
same
or
an
even
worse
problem
does
the
factory
consider
this
kind
of
thing
normal
and
ship
their
monitors
with
less
than
perfect
alignment
i
cant
speak
for
mag
innovision
but
as
far
as
nec
is
concerned
they
are
adjusted
to
factoryspec
before
leaving
the
central
usa
distribution
point
ma
for
the
eastern
canadian
market
now
heres
the
key
nec
knows
that
the
monitors
adjustments
are
very
sensitive
to
shipping
over
distances
with
all
the
bumps
rough
handling
and
such
and
therefore
expect
and
at
least
in
theory
require
that
the
local
distributor
not
dealer
have
it
adjusted
at
the
local
service
centre
bull
hn
information
systems
in
toronto
before
sale
this
is
the
correct
and
probably
only
way
of
having
any
chance
of
receiving
a
perfect
monitor
the
definition
of
perfect
seems
to
depend
on
how
picky
one
is
in
my
case
quite
are
other
netters
just
living
with
these
kind
of
imperfections
i
for
one
was
not
willing
to
accept
what
i
considered
a
substandard
monitor
and
after
two
months
of
wrangling
and
direct
contact
with
nec
finally
received
a
satisfactorily
adjusted
monitor
not
perfect
imho
but
a
major
improvement
over
what
the
dealer
and
distributor
were
trying
convince
me
was
normal
the
short
answer
is
no
dont
accept
these
imperfections
as
normal
because
for
the
premium
one
pays
for
the
larger
screen
monitors
one
has
a
right
to
expect
higher
quality
and
if
youre
persistent
youll

it

just
the
way
the

it
there
are
three
key
differences
in
scsi
the
controller
chip
the
port
and
the
software
that
is
it
let
us
look
as
scsi
in
from
this
stand
point
asynchronous
and
synchronous
modes
software
scsi
driver
only
asynchronous
is
slower
then
synchronous
mode
only
vs
synchronous
speeds
can
be
reached
by
most
divices
with
a
rewrite
of
the
software
driver
as
is
the
case
for
the
mac
quadra
this
is
the
main
source
for
the
confusion
this
differs
from
only
in
the
controler
chip
in
most
machines
in
the
mac
and
some
pcs
this
is
called
fast
because
it
uses
ports
and
software
drivers
and
can
produce
speeds
through
inspite
of
this
even
in
the
slower
asynchronous
mode
average
speed
in
asynchronous
mode
with
in
both
quadras
and
higher
end
pcs
synchronous
mode
just
allows
a
higher
burst
rate
two
versionswidefast
wide
requires
two
things
over
a
software
driver
and
a
wide
scsi
port
on
the
machine
and
the
external
device
fast
also
requires
two
things
over
driver
software
and
that
the
recieving
devise
support
fast
speed
of
both
is
the
same
with
burst
also
know
as
wide
and
fast
scsi
over
this
requires
driver
software
wide
port
and
that
the
recieving
devices
also
have
a
mode
chip
as
expected
this
is
very
expencive
speed
with
bursts
as
i
said
simple
seven
versions
of
scsi
seperated
by
software
the
controler
chip
and
the
port
standarize
the
software
and
it
drops
to
only
five
versions
of

by
only

does
any

what

do

found
out

im
curious
as

why
there
are
dip
switches
on

with
apparantly
little

secondly
does
anyone
know
why
commodore
had
to

so
crazed
in
their
design
of
the

with

ie

can
anyone

what

help

wanted

im
in

for
a

scanner
however
i
dont
know
anyone
who
has
one
i
have
my
eye
on
two
choices
dexxa
this
scanner
is
available
at
walmart
for
it
includes
grayworks
software
and
provides
dpi
and
grayscales
i
think
the
ocr
software
catchword
is
available
through
mailorder
for
about
also
mustek
gray
artist
for
windows
this
scanner
offers
grayscales
according
to
cad
graphics
and
dpi
it
is
available
for
mailorder
and
comes
with
perceive
ocr
and
picture
publisher
le
i
am
also
looking
at
a
genius
hand
scanner
from
cad
graphics
it
is
basically
the
same
as
the
mustek
scanner
except
for
the
resolution
dpi
and
price
basically
i
would
like
recommendations
on
which
to
buy
i
have
heard
that
logitech
makes
the
best
and
manufactures
dexxa
scanners
but
which
one
is
the
best
buy
would
dpi
really
be
helpful
output
would
be
no
better
than
hp
laserjet
iii
or
canon
to
i
am
leaning
toward
the
mustek
because
it
offers
the
most
features
and
is
in
the
middle
in
terms
of
prices
which
should
i
buy
if
you
have
a
hand
scanner
please
let
me
know
whether
or
not
you
would
recommend
it
also
if
you
know
of
another
scanner
within
the
price
range
under
that
would
be
a
better
deal
please

the

you

this

using

is
it
the
rockwell
chipset
itself
there
were
an

problems

that

pretty

expected
with

talking

is

im
pretty

oblivious

problems
so
youll
have
to
get
it
from
someone
else
however
i
can
tell
you
to
stay
clear
of
any
board
which
uses
the
rockwell
mpu
as
opposed
to
the
dpu
for
an
internal
implementation
this
is
because
the
mpu
used
speed
buffering
instead
of
having
a
interface
without
the
interface
the
number
of
interrupts
are
still
the
same
and
thus
may
get
dropped
under
multitasking
conditions
like
in

as
far
as
i
know
the
speed
buffering
works
ok
for

can
anyone
explain
in
fairly
simple
terms
why
if
i
get
i
might
need
an
scsi
controler
rather
than
an

will
performance
suffer
that
much
for
a

if
i
dont
have
a
tape
drive
or
cdrom
any
help
would
be
appreciated
so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual
page
the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the
io
bus
and
uses
the
system
board
direct
memory
access
dma
for
record
data
transfers
i
expect
to
see
something
similar
for
the
pcat
hdd
adapter
so
the
lowly
lowdensity
original
pc
fdd
card
used
dma
and
the
pcat
hdd
controller
doesnt
that
makes
real
sense

heck
if

youd
hear
all
kinds
of
complaints
about
isa
bus
systems
with
more
than
ram
not
working
with
their
ide
drives
is
the
dma
addressing
limit
of
the
isa

and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
trouble
there
would
be
no
problems
as
long
as
the
os
didnt
set
up
a
dma
transfer
to
an
area
above
the
mb

the
dma
controller
probably
cant
be
programmed
that
way
anyways
so
there
probably
isint
a
problem
with
this
besides
like
i
said
before
the

uses

how

they
dont
have
a
conflict
because
technically
does
not
use
the
parallel
printer
processor
the
actual
number
escapes
me
contains
a
printer
control
register
which
enables
the
chip
to
transmit
an
interrupt
to
the
interrupt
controller
as
then
onto
the
main
processor
as
int
by
default
the
parallel
printer
processor
does
not
enable
its
interrupt
line
therefore
no
int
will
be
sourced
from
the
printer
controller
chip
thus
enabling
other
devices
to
use
the
actual
note
this
applies

ports
also
which
by

do

please
pull
off
the

block
from
this
will
not
affect
the
proformance
of

this
is
what
my
manual
says
about
i
never
knew
that
it
was
there
but
the

is
a

beats

that

some

every

they

havent

them
because
theyre
afraid
it
isnt

just

only

the
difference
between
my

is
big

changing

ill

the

ill

ill
be

an

cos
theyre
fast
enough
i
have

for
them
and
itll
have
vram
just
like
a
weitek
card
it
will
also
be
much
cheaper
when

arrive
ill

im
not
sure
if
this
will
work
but
how
about
using
one
of
those
t
expanders
used
in
the
lowprofile
cases
they
allow
slots
staggered
on
either
side
of
the
card
you
can
install
it
in
the
last
slot
and
then
probably
have
or
sideways
slots
this
is
actually
how
it
is
done
in
the
low
profile
cases
a
standard
motherboard
the
t
connector
in
one
slot
and
the
expansion
cards
plugged
into
the
t
i
guess
you
could
do
this
at
each
end
of
the
slots
to
add
even
more
the
t
connectors
are
simply
tracks
with
slots
on
them
no
electronics
on
it
the
only
downside
your
case
wont
close
but
for
a
homebrew

may
not

get

working

it
does
not

the
documentation

no

at

as
an
example
it
says
the
serial
port
can
be
changed
to
from
by
moving
jumpers
but
does
not
say
what
jumpers
to
move
there
are
banks
of

the
first
one
is
labeled
as
follows
g
the
second
bank
is
labeled
irq
and
has
the
following
labels
i
have
determined
that
the
jumpers
tell
it
to
address
the
first
serial
port
as
or
the
jumpers
tell
it
to
use
the
printer
port
as
or
i
am
guessing
that
the
g
enables
the
game
port
and
the
should
enable
the
second
serial
port
but
i
cant
get
it
to
work
i
have
tried
numerous
setting
on
the
irq
bank
without
success
i
assume
that
this
bank
must
tell
the

which
irqs
to
use
for
both
ports

dont

i
assume
that
something

with

what
are
some

my

got

a

i
can
look
up
the

number
if
its
important
and
ive
been
trying

help
him
install
it
ive
got
a

since
my

busted
and
i
have
to
use
his
until
i
get
mine
fixed
he
already
has
a

ide

again
i
forget
the
model
number
but
i
can
find
out
anyway
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
bloody
thing
up
ive
managed
to
get
one
or
the
other
drive
up
with
the
other
disconnected
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
whenever
i
try
the
thing
hangs
during
bootup
never
gets
past
the
system
test
the
ide
controllers
instruction
sheet
says
it
supports
two
drives
i
think
ive
configured
the
cmos
correctly
the
powers
plugged
in
properly
i
even
learned
about
the
masterslave
relationship
that
two
hds
are
supposed
to
have
didnt
know
pcs
were
into
sm
and
i
think
i
configured
the
jumpers
properly
the
one
is
the
master
the
new
one
is
the
slave
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
maybe
im
doing
the
cabling
wrong
ive
tried
several
combinations
controller
master
slave
controller
slave
master
master
controller
slave
none
of
them
worked
unfortunately
i
cant
think
of
any
others
another
possibility
is
that
the
one
is
already
partitioned
into
two
seperate
drives
c
and
d
and
the
cmos
asks
for
c
drive
and
d
drive
setup

ive
seen
could
this
be

so
i
need

the

came
bereft
of
any

for
some
info
for
the

setup
the

has

on

single

errors
of
up

within

onthefly
in

as
they

allowing

performance
i
take
this
to
mean
error
correction
isnt
the
bottleneck
for
pagemode
operations
the
datatransfer
rate
to
and
from
the
buffer
ram
is
up
to
mbs
this
high
transfer
rate
allows
the
at
interface
ic
to
communicate
over
the
at
bus
at
a
datatransfer
rate
of
mbs
while
the
dcs
simultaneously
controls
disktoram
transfers
so
the
thing
can
even
do
its
cache
prefetch
while
its
sending
the
requested
sector
it
has
read

for

i

you

call

whats
the
difference
between

and
doing
devicemousesys
in
configsys
the
only
difference
is
the
time
the
driver
gets
loaded
mousesys
will
be
loaded
during
the
configsys
and
therefor
before
the
commandcom
mousecom
will
be
loaded
during
autoexecbat
and
so
after
the
commandcom
which
one
is
better
mousecom
could
be
started
from
the
commandline
after
the
booting
and
it
could
perhaps
be
unloaded
if
no
other
driver
is
loaded
after
it
the
working
of
both
drivers
is
totally
the
same
when
i
ran
dos
i
preferred
loading
most
of
the
drivers
in
autoexecbat
because
some
programs
wont
run
with
some
drivers
and
i
could
choose
the
ones
i
needed
during
startup
but
with
this
advantage
is
gone
because
drdos
lets
you
choose
in
configsys
which
drivers
should
be
loaded

it
i

dd
the

version
i
am
very
pleased
with
its
performance
here
is
my
suggestion
if
you
do
not
have
any
compression
software
currently
i
would
go
with
dos
compression
all
the
discussion
on
the
net
indicates
that
for
you
get
the
compression
built
into
the
os
plus
the
other
utilities
that
you
would
pay
way
more
than
for
besides
you
are
now
at
whatever
that
means
if
you
have
doubledisk
already
like
i
do
the
cost
is
for
the
upgrade
after
thinking
about
it
and
asking
the
net
i
decided
that
i
could
not
go
wrong
with
the
update
cost
i
have
never
suffered
from
performance
of
dd
i
have
a
hd
with
large
sw
packages
in
both
compressed
and
uncompressed
format
it
works
great
not
delays
i
think
the
a
is
better
than
b
arguements
are
a
lot
of
bunk
they
are
all
comparable
in
performance
i
am
looking
forward
to
being
able
to
loadhigh
the
dd
sw
that
has
been
an
annoyance
if
you
have
stacker
etal
currently
i
would
not

it

i

was
trying

bypass

access

moved
the
game
to
the

region
of
the
disk
since
then
the
game
has
never

there
was
never
any
damage

performance
for

has

im

just
in

cant
be
too
careful
not
that
i
doubt
that
your

depends
on
figuring

which
exact
svga
theyre
looking
at
and
dont

vesa
is
still
pretty
new
every

confuses
them
the

really
annoy
me
you
can
do
at
if
you
tell
the

you
have
an

they
only
have

six

if
you
choose
generic
you
cant
get
any
high
refreshes
at
all
but
at
you
are
limited
to
seems
to
me
that
the
hardware
should
be
able
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
at
it
sure
should
be
able
to
do
it
at

was
the
main
reason
i
bought
the

over
the

f
vlb
i
currently
have
and
it
will
do
hz
as
well
i
think
we
go
to
at
least
hz
at
and
maybe
more
and
its
a
function
of
the
ramdac
speed
not
the
power
we
need
to
fix
the
problems
youve
noted
they
were
already
on
the
list
if
youre
really
interested
though
take
a
look
at
the
text
file
which
holds
the
data
from
which
the
choices
in
the
monitor
installation
program
are
built
working
by
analogy
you
can
build
up
a
new
monitor
definition
that
has
the
right
combinations
of
refresh
rates
for
your
monitors
keep
a
backup
copy
of
the
file
once
youve
built
a
new
version
of
the
file
run
the
installation
program
inst
and
your
new
choices
should
show
up
this
assumes
you
have
the
weitek
v
drivers
you
can
tell
the
rev
number
by
looking
at
the
modification
time
of
the
driver
is
version
microsoft
uses
this
gimmick
too
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
things
according
to
the
hercules
speedy
program
this
program
tests
various
operations
and
reports
the
results
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
the
graphite
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
was
running
in
a
isa
so
the
numbers
arent
really
comparable
the
following
numbers
were
all
obtained
using
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memory
i
give
ranges
because
the
program
reports
the
numbers
as
it
computes
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
the
speedy
benchmark
was
put
out
by
hercules
and
iit
who
to
my
knowledge
were
unencumbered
by
any
motivations
except
making
the
hercules
graphiteiit
card
look
really
good
so
id
take
the
numbers
with
a
ton
of
salt
texas
instruments
did
the
same
thing
with
wintach
trying
to
make
the
look
good
compared
to
the
as
if
anyone
cared
its
safer
though
not
safe
to
use
benchmarks
from
unbiased
sources
such
as
testing
labs
columnists
etc
interestingly
the
solid
vectors
and
shaded
polygons
show
no
improvement
and
hatched
polygons
ie
filled
with
crosshatching
and
ternary
rops
whatever
they
are
graphics
operations
like
xors
maybe
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
think
youll
a
large
discrepancy
between
the
results
of
speedy
and
the
results
of
anything
else
in
the
universe
on
these
things
i
give
two
numbers
for
the
fonts
because
i
think
they
are
caching
when
the
fonts
are
first
drawn
on
the
screen
they
are
done
fairly
slowly
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increases
dramatically
sounds
like
programming
to
a
benchmark
to
me
font
caching
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
optimization
windows
has
hooks
for
it

right
into

it
useless
in

it

elegance

you
save

just
do

you
happen
to

call
it
the

hi
there
we
just

a

with

ati

pro
video
card
everything
seems
to
work
fine
except
for
the
windows
drivers
for
bit
and
and
bit
modes
the
fonts
and
icons
start
deteriorating
after
windows
startup
and
within
minutes
of
use
everything
on
the
screen
is
totally
unintelligible
naturally
i
called
gateway
tech
support
to
inquire
about
this
the
technician
asked
me
about
the
drivers
and
i
told
him
it
was
version
build
he
told
me
that
the
and
bit
drivers
for
the
ati
ultra
pro
simply
do
not
work
is
this
true
if
so
im
simply
amazed
how
could
this
be
the
strange
thing
is
i
would
have
expected
to
see
some
discussion
on
here
unless
the
subject
has
made
the
faq
one
very
suspicious
point
that
came
up
later
was
that
he
stated
that
none
of
the
windows
accelerator
boards
have
working
andor
bit
drivers
for
windows
i
easily
challenged
him
on
that
because
ive
been
running
a
diamond
in
bit
mode
at
home
for
months
now
and
i
have
tested
and
used
the
bit
mode
as
well
he

hi
i
recently

i
own

so
far
failed

get
the

it
works
very

i
get
an

telling

the

something

the

the

dont

has
anyone
ever

was
wondering
if
anyone
using

could
kindly
post
hisher

hi
one
of

i
think
its
the

supports
a

means
to
not

narrowed

notice
two
minor
irritations
a
under

when
an
entry
in
a

is
highlighted
such
as
in
an
open
menu
and
then
is
deselected
a
faint
vertical
line
often
remains
where
the
left
edge
of
the
highlighted
rectangle
used
to
be
b
with
word
for
windows
when
you
use
shading
in
a

the
display
shows
the
inverse
of
the
shading
for
example
if
you
shade
the
cell
as
the
display
is
the
printout
is
ok
the
big
killer
bug
is
using
the
borland
c
integrated
development
environment
the
problem
occurs
when
you
click
on
the
turbo
debugger
icon
or
use
the
debugger
option
in
the
run
command
and
the
debugger
application
goes
to
vga
character
mode
as
it
is
designed
to
do
the
screen
goes
haywire
and
is
largely
unreadable
the
turbo
debugger
display
is
all
garbled
through
trial
and
error
i
have
found
that
when
the
disrupted
screen
is
displayed
you
should
do
altspacebar
followed
by
the
letter
r
this
instructs
turbo
debugger
to
refresh
the
screen
and
it
does
this
satisfactorily
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
do
this
the
bug
is
more
than
with
the
diamond
drivers
the
same
disruptive
behavior
happens
with
the
standard
vga
driver
that
comes
with
windows
there
must
be
something
in
the
video
card
that
mishandles
the
vga
mode
the
problem
is
not
my
monitor
the
same
bug
shows
up
when
i
use
another
monitor
in
place
of
my
usual
one
i
still
like
this

re

wrote
i
just
bought
a
new
ide
hard
drive
for
my
system
to
go
with
the
one
i
already
had
my
problem
is
this
my
system
only
had
a
ide
cable
for
one
drive
so
i
had
to
buy
cable
with
two
drive
connectors
on
it
and
consequently
have
to
switch
cables
the
problem
is
the
new
hard
drives
manual
refers
to
matching
pin
on
the
cable
with
both
pin
on
the
drive
itself
and
pin
on
the
ide
card
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
figure
out
how
to
tell
which
way
to
plug
in
the
cable
to
align
these
most
ide
drives
that
i
have
dealt
with
have
had
pin
labeled
on
the
printed
circuit
board
this
is
sufficient
to
determine
which
side
is
which
if
your
ide
drive
does
not
have
a
label
then
you
can
look
for
a
polarization
notch
in
the
receptacle
the
connector
on
the
drive
with
the
pins
if
the
receptacle
is
center
polarized
that
is
it
has
one
rectangular
notch
about
mm
wide
positioned
in
the
center
of
one
side
then
you
can
identify
pin
as
follows
look
into
the
pins
with
the
notch
at
the
top
pin
is
at
the
top
right
on
all
drives
i
have
seen
this
is
toward
the
power
connector
as
for
which
pin
is
pin
on
the
controller
well
you
can
use
the
same
criteria
but
look
hard
for
the
labelling
of
any
pin
once
you
know
which
end
pin
are
on
or
pins
the
oposite
end
then
you
are
all
set
all
you
need
to
do
is
keep
the
pin
end
connected
to
the
pin
end
you
dont
even
have
to
look
at
the
cable
itself
just
trace
the
pin
side
of
the
cable
through
usually
the
pin
of
the
cable
is
identified
by
a
different
color
red
usually
but
beware
many
cable
makers
are
not
very
careful
about
this
i
have
seen
cables
with
pin
being
the
one
marked
red
of
course
with
nonpolarized
connectors
this
doesnt
matter
you
can
plug
the
cable
in
either
way
and
you
decide
which
side
is
pin
secondly
the
cable
has
like
a
connector
at
two
ends
and
one
between
them
i
figure
one
end
goes
in
the
controler
and
then
the
other
two
go
into
the
drives
does
it
matter
which
i
plug
into
the
master
drive
and
which
into
the
slave
any
help
appreciated
thanks
it
doesnt
matter
what
gets
plugged
where
but
it
does
matter
how
the
drives
are
jumpered
there
will
be
amongst
other
options
two
jumpers
that
you
should
be
concerned
with
on
both
drives
one
jumper
will
select
whether
the
drive
is
the
slave
or
the
master
if
it
is
the
master
then
a
second
jumper
selects
whether
or
not
a
slave
is
present
you
will
have
to
consult
the
docuementation
that
came
with
you
drives
if
you
do
not
have
docuementation
then
just
call
the
manufacturers
hotline
number
or
fax
number
if
they
have
one
this
kind
of
information
is
routinely
needed
by
people
just
like
yourself
they
will
fax
you
complete
info
about
the
jumpers
if
you
dont
have
convenient
access
to
a
fax
machine
then
you
can
usually
get

that
in

something

a

has
to

a
get

system
call
apparently
the
clock
hardware
interrupt
and
bios
dont
do
this
date
advance
automatically
the
get

call
notices
that
a
midnight
reset
flag
has
been
set
and
then
then
advances
the
date
anybody
with
more
info
there
are
two
problems
the
bios
tod
routine
which
updates
the
bios
clock
uses
only
bit
for
day
increment
so
a
second
wrapping
of
the
clock
past
midnight
will
get
lost
if
no
one
calls
the
bios
to
read
the
clock
in
the
meantime
and
the
bios
resets
the
day
wrap
indicator
on
the
first
get
date
call
from
anybody
after
the
wrap
indicator
has
been
set
so
unless
the
first
bios
get
date
call
after
midnight
is
done
by
the
dos
kernel
which
is
the
only
part
of
dos
which
knows
how
to
increment
the
date
the
day
wrap
indication
is
normally
lost
my
guess
is
that
kevins
menu
system
uses
bios
calls
to
read
the
clock
in
order
to
display
the
time
and
is
hence
the
entity
which
causes
the
day
wrap
indication
to
get
lost
even
if
the
menu
system
notices
the
day
wrap
which
i
think
is
indicated
by
a
nonzero
value
in
al
there
really
isnt
any
particularly
good
way
to
tell
dos
about
it
so
that
dos
can
update
the
day
the
menu
system
should
use
dos
calls
to
get
the
time
which
would
cause
the
dos
kernel
to
do
the
bios
call
and
the
wrap
indicator
would
hence
be
processed
properly
possibly
though
the
menu
system
cant
easily
use
dos
calls
for
time
because
dos
is
not
reentrant

perhaps
time
incrementing

occur

i
need
to
know

to
connect
to
make
a

for
a

so
i
can
build

is
used
to
test
the

thanks
for
any

i
got
the

deleted
if
you
are
handy
with
a
soldering
iron
the
loopback
plugs
are
easy
to
make
on
a
serial
ninepin
port
use
a
female
connector
and
connect
pins
to
to
to

to

youll
need

the

is
the

assigned

this

the

the

to

the

it

the

hello

still
the

around
function

is
there
any
chance
to
connect
one
of

to

clone
i
do
understand
that
the
new
at
keyboard
has
more
functionality
ie
the
typematic
repeat
rate
is
programmable
etc
it
seams
to
me
that
the
pins
electrical
specs
of
the
old
and
the
new
keyboard
are
however
the
same
maybe
the
communication
protocol
is
different
please
answer
by

also
if
you
can
tell

that
is

so
when

you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
think
its
the
scsi
card
doing
the
dma
transfers
not
the
disks
the
scsi
card
can
do
dma
transfers
containing
data
from
any
of
the
scsi
devices
it
is
attached
when
it
wants
to
an
important
feature
of
scsi
is
the
ability
to
detach
a
device
this
frees
the
scsi
bus
for
other
devices
this
is
typically
used
in
a
multitasking
os
to
start
transfers
on
several
devices
while
each
device
is
seeking
the
data
the
bus
is
free
for
other
commands
and
data
transfers
when
the
devices
are
ready
to
transfer
the
data
they
can
aquire
the
bus
and
send
the
data
on
an
ide
bus
when
you
start
a
transfer
the
bus
is
busy
until
the
disk
has
seeked
the
data
and
transfered
it
this
is
typically
a
second
lock
out
for
other
processes
wanting
the
bus
irrespective
of
transfer
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual

the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the

and
uses
the

board
direct

access
dma
for

i

to

something

an

about

this
is
an

between

the

it
costs

is

yes
how

really
fit

sounds

this

either
from

it
seems
that
my

are
not
working
properly
they
are
there

recocnize

tests
them
ok

well
does
anybody
know
a

a

i
eliminated
the

temporaly
by

blowing
the

hi
everyone
i
have
a
question
regarding
my
stack
on
my
pc
i
am
programming
in
turbo
c
and
my
program
is
rather
large
model
large
too
i
keep
getting
errors
that
i
am
running
out
of
memory
after
a
while
of
running
the
program
when
i
compile
the
program
it
says
i
have
meg
of
ram
so
i
cant
seem
to
explain
why
it
crashes
all
it
is
doing
is
running
in
a
loop
while
the
operator
is
idle
and
after
a
while
of
sitting
it
will
screw
up
all
the
variables
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
my
stack
is
filling
up
and
overflowing
does
the
program
take
memory
up
when
it
is
calling
void
functions
that
do
not
return
anything
i
have
been
working
on
this
problem
for
days
and
i
would
really
appreciate
any
responce
if
this
is
not
the
correct
newsgroup
i
will
gladly
repost
but
this
is
the
only

could

you
unfortunately
failed

i
assume
you

it

not
when

the

could
be
occuring
in

not

likely
or

as
well
as
the

the
fact
that
you
have
ami
bios
is
not
conclusive
in
determining
the
board
manufacturer
either
boards
are
made
by
thousands
of

among
others
that
buy
the

brand
chips
and
put
them
together
with

to

tend
to
doubt
your

is
with
your

also
anyway
perhaps
if
you
answer
those
questions
someone

motherboard
advice
needed
hi
does
anyone
have
a
source
for
motherboards
ive
been
calling
around
the
local
stores
and
everyone
appears
to
be
only
stocking
the
or
motherboards
how
difficult
is
it
to
modify
a
motherboard
to
run
at
mhz
is
it
as
simple
as
replacing
the

with

what
is
a
uart
i
dont
know
the
exact
meaning
of
uart
but
i
think
it
is
something
like
universal
arithmetic
receiver
transmitter
normally
the
older
boards
have
a
or
uart
on
board
those
chips
generate
an
irq
for
every
char
they
received
the
uart
has
an
internal
byte
buffer
so
with
the
right
software
installed
it
generates
an
irq
every
chars
what
does
it
do
for
highspeed
modems
is
it
necessary
for
or
higher
throughput
if
you
ran
dos
you
dont
need
a
because
dos
runs
only
one
task
at
a
time
and
the
whole
cpupower
could
be
used
for
the
transfer
but
if
you
are
running
a
multitasking
os
such
as
unix
etc
windows
the
cpu
cannot
work
the
whole
time
with
one
task
the
result
are
lost
characters
or
broken
transmissions
because
of
timeouts
is
it
only
for
internal
modems
no
the
only
diffrence
is
that
internal
modems
have
the
uart
on
board
whereas
external
modems
are
connected
to
the
computer
over
a
serial
port
which
has
the
uart
on
board
if
you
have
any
experience
with
or
higher
speed
modems
please
let
me
know
what
you
think
also
any

if
anyone

what
can

please
let

know
most
likely
reason
is
that
your

failing
this
battery
maintains
the
contents
of
the
cmos
memory
when
ac
power
is
turned
off
and
if

is
flakey
then
the
contents

will
be
lost
and
the

will
be
wrong
along
with
most
other
of
the
cmos
data
try
replacing
the
battery
if
however
your
pc
doesnt
use
a
battery
but
a
large
capacitor
to
power
the
cmos
you
should
check
to
see
if
you
can
replace
the
capacitor
with
a
more
normal
lithium
battery
if
this
isnt
possible
make
sure
you
leave
your

on
for
a
half
hour
or
hour
each
day
this
will
keep
the
capacitor
charged
id
opt
for
the
battery
change
though
its
also
possible
but
unlikely
that
a
rogue
problem
or
even
a
virus
is
corrupting
the

if

okay
get

from

the
one
i
already
had
my
problem
is
this
my

only
had
a
ide
cable
for
one
drive
so
i
had
to
buy
cable
with
two
drive
connectors
on
it
and
consequently
have
to
switch
cables
the
problem
is
the
new
hard

manual
refers
to
matching
pin
on
the
cable
with
both
pin
on
the
drive
itself
and
pin
on
the

but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
figure
out
how
to
tell
which
way
to
plug
in
the
cable
to
align
these
secondly
the
cable
has
like
a
connector
at
two
ends
and
one
between
them
i
figure
one
end
goes
in
the
controler
and
then
the
other
two
go
into
the
drives
does
it
matter
which
i
plug
into

which
into

actually
i
have
no

so
dont
count
that
last
statement
what
im
asking
is
what
pins
does
it
use
or
what
are
its
specifications
i
just
want
to
solder
one

instead
of
buying
one
i

ps
im
intending
to
use
the
cable
for
pctopc
transfers
via
laplink
or
telix
ideas
and
info
gladly
accepted
i
do
not
have
specific
knowledge
of
laplink
or
telix
but
my
recommendation
for
any
package
is
to
follow
each
ones
instructions
for
making
the
null
modem
cable
the
reason
is
that
each
one
may
be
different
since
there
isnt
really
a
standard
for
pc
to
pc
communications
the
following
is
a
tutorial
i
wrote
up
that
will
give
you
an
understanding
about
and
null
modems
but
you
should
still
check
your
software
i
will
eplain
a
couple
of
details
of
is
a
commumications
specification
for
communicating
between
a
computer
and
a
modem
actually
it
can
be
between
any
end
system
and
any
communications
hardware
the
terminology
used
is
data
terminal
equipment
dte
and
data
communications
equipment
dce
spells
out
the
voltage
levels
the
connector
type
the
pinouts
and
the
signal
protocols
the
connector
is
a
but
ibm
has
set
an
alternative
standard
of
the
primary
signals
are
transmit
data
td
recieve
data
rd
and
signal
ground
sg
there
are
other
signals
that
provide
control
between
the
dte
and
the
dce
for
example
the
dte
announces
that
it
is
powered
up
and
ready
to
participate
in
communications
via
the
data
terminal
ready
dtr
signal
dtr
is
an
output
on
the
dte
and
an
input
on
the
dce
similarly
the
dce
announces
that
it
is
ready
to
participate
in
communications
via
the
data
set
ready
dsr
signal
dsr
is
an
input
on
the
dte
and
an
output
on
the
dce
ok
thats
five
signals
there
are
only
four
more
of
interest
the
request
to
send
rts
signal
is
an
output
from
the
dte
and
an
input
to
the
dce
that
is
used
to
ask
the
dce
permission
to
send
data
if
the
dce
agrees
it
sends
an
ok
via
the
clear
to
send
cts
signal
for
completeness
the
cts
is
an
input
to
the
dte
and
an
output
from
the
dce
the
other
two
signals
of
interest
are
ring
indicator
ri
and
data
carrier
detect
dcd
these
are
both
inputs
to
the
dte
and
outputs
from
the
dce
ri
is
just
what
you
would
expect
a
signal
to
the
dte
saying
that
someone
is
attempting
to
establish
a
connection
to
the
dce
this
is
rather
specific
to
the
modem
telephone
line
setup
dcd
is
a
way
for
the
dce
to
announce
that
the
connection
has
been
established
ie
the
local
dce
is
talking
to
some
remote
dce
there
thats
it
oh
there
are
many
other
signals
defined
but
they
are
obsolete
i
have
explained
the
nine
signals
that
are
on
a
pc
the
pinouts
are
as
follows
name
sg
td
rd
dtr
dsr
dcd
rts
cts
ri
now
to
address
your
problem
at
hand
when
you
connect
a
pc
to
a
pc
a
dte
to
a
dte
there
is
no
dce
pair
in
the
middle
and
therefore
the
signal
definitions
dont
work
out
quite
right
there
is
no
dce
to
assert
the
cts
dsr
dcd
or
ri
so
the
common
thing
to
do
is
to
not
use
these
signals
at
all
and
also
forget
about
the
dtr
and
rts
outputs
as
well
if
this
is
done
you
simply
make
a
null
modem
a
cable
that
passes
through
sg
and
crosses
td
and
rd
ie
pin
of
one
end
connects
to
pin
at
the
other
end
etc
the
problem
with
this
solution
is
that
a
pc
that
wants
to
send
data
has
no
way
of
knowing
if
the
other
pc
is
ready
it
would
have
to
just
send
the
data
and
hope
it
got
through
therefore
a
better
null
modem
would
include
the
dtrdsr
pair
crossed
a
particular
point
a
confusion
is
in
the
software
area
just
because
you
run
the
wires
does
not
mean
that
the
soft
ware
will
use
them
if
you
are
using
the
builtin
bios
to
control
the
serial
port
then
the
bios
dictates
what
wires
you
need
and
how
they
are
to
be
used
but
if
you
have
a
comm
package
such
as
brooklyn
bridge
or
lap
link
or
telix
then
those
packages
dictate
the
cabling
requirements
the
only
thing
you
can
guess
reliably
is
the
sg
td
and
rd
the
dtrdsr
is
also
fairly
common
there
is
one
more
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
here
and
that
is
flow
control
in
the
scenerio
the
dces
are
responsible
for
flow
control
and
it
is
assumed
that
the
dce
couldnt
possible
overrun
the
dte
by
this
i
mean
that
as
long
as
the
dte
has
its
dtr
line
asserted
the
dce
will
send
data
without
requesting
permission
first
note
the
contrast
to
the
other
direction
of
data
flow
the
dte
must
request
permission
by
asserting
the
rts
line
and
it
must
wait
for
the
cts
signal
before
it
can
send
and
now
in
the
dte
to
dte
scenerio
the
question
is
do
you
need
flow
control
the
answser
is
usually
but
how
for
nonbinary
communications
one
common
technique
is
xon
xoff
which
is
implemented
in
software
no
wires
are
dedicated
to
flow
control
the
td
and
rd
carry
the
xon
and
xoff
commands
this
type
of
flow
control
can
be
used
in
addition
to
hardware
flow
control
but
the
problem
is
that
you
cant
send
binary
data
because
your
data
might
include
the
xon
or
xoff
codes
and
cause
erroneous
conrol
signals
a
work
around
is
to
have
the
software
insert
and
extract
escape
codes
but
the
hardware
flow
control
is
prefered
the
problem
with
hard
ware
flow
control
is
that
there
is
no
standard
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
do
it
and
i
bet
they
have
all
been
tried
one
cornerstone
of
all
the
methods
is
to
use
the
rtscts
for
one
direction
but
beyond
that
anything
is
fair
game
again
you
must
look
to
you
comm
package
for
cabling
requirements
but
i
bet
youll
find
that
one
cable
if
wired
properly
could
work
with
all
of
the
packages
as
long
as
they
are
of
the
same
vintage
by
the
way
i
am
familiar
with
one
package
that
uses
rtscts
and
dtrdsr
for
flow
control
the
rts
is
request
to
send
and
the
dtr
is
ready
to
recieve
the
cts
is
the
clear
to
send
and
the
dsr
is
the
request
to
recieve
this
does
not
mean
a
differnt
cable
it
is
just
software
the
clincher
to
all
of
this
cabling
stuff
is
that
it
is
common
to
have
the
uart
directly
controlled
by
the
cts
signal
which
means
that
the
cts
must
be
present
even
if
you
are
not
support
ing
it
in
software
for
these
cases
you
will
find
cables
that
short
the
rts
to
the
cts
at
the
same
end
or
perhaps
the
dtr
to
the
cts
other
possible
shorting
might
be
done
just
because
the
software
expects
certain
signals
that
you
dont
have
or
dont
feel
like
providing
because
it
would
mean
additional
wires
specifically
i
am
talking
about
the
dsr
shorting
the
dtr
to
the
dsr
is
not
a
good
idea
in
general
but
you
may
find
cables
like
this
it
is
a
bad
idea
because
it
defeats
the
whole
purpose
one
more
gotcha
signal
is
the
dcd
some
software
including
the
pc
bios
expects
to
see
the
dcd
before
it
will
work
this
signal
sometimes
gets
shorted
with
the
dtr
but
my
favorite
null
modem
has
the
rts
and
cts
shorted
at
each
end
but
the
rts
is
also
connected
through
to
the
other
end
and
connected
to
dcd
and
of
course
the
dtrdsr
are
crossed
as
are
the
tdrd
and
of
course
the
sg
must
pass
through
this
null
modem
works
with
most
software
the
flow
control
if
any
can
use
the
rtsdcd
with
the
dtrdsr
if
your
comm
package
does
not
specify
the
cable
required
for
pc
to

a

it

just

how
about

there
is
a

it

put

actually
after

im
surprised

have

between
basically
the

system

with
a

or
a

and
no

thus
the

is
better
keeping
in
mind
that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two
tasks
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
i
need
to
decide
quickly
so
any
speedy
help
would
be
appreciated
even
more
btw
we
have

performed
a

of

sustains
only
over

while
our
sparcs
sustain
on
the

going

the

of
the

increases

there
such
a

it

thank
your
software
for
that
if
dos
had
a
few
more
brains
it
could
format
floppies
etc
while
you
were
doing
something
else
the
hardware
will
support
it
but
dos
at
least
wont
again
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
scsi
floppies
arent
on
the
ide
bus
your
arguement
makes
no
sense
this
isnt
an
ide
issue
the
floppys
have
their
own
processor
on
their
controller
board
which
handles
all
of
these
commands
the
difference
between
ide
and
scsi
is
that
all
scsi
peripherials
are
intelligent
they
each
have
their
own
controller
they
depend
on
the
cpu
to
do
fewer
things
for
them
ie
ide
drives
needing
a
processor
to
transfer
their
data
its
a
long
story
but
i
still
use
ide
on
my
except
for
the
cdrom
which
thanks
to
scsi
i
can
move
between
both
machines
if
and
when
scsi
is
better
standardized
and
supported
on
the
ibmclone
machines
i
plan
to
completely
get
rid
of
ide
and
if
you
stick
with
dos
youll
wonder
why
you
cant
multitask
again
i
ask
why
cant
a
unix
or
type
os
do
all
the
miraculous
things
with
an
ide
harddrive
that
it
can
with
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
the
dettachcallback
mechanism
alows
the
cpu
to
make
requests
of
the
devices
on
the
scsi
bus
and
then
dettach
and
go
about
its
business
later
when
the
device
is
done
it
issues
a
callback
to
say
that
the
data
has
arrived
or
the
function
has
completed
most
scsi
cards
will
also
dma
the
data
into
memory
without
the
interupting
the
cpu
therefore
allowing
it
to
continue
working
uninterupted
ide
supports
no
such
concept
as
dettachcallback
can
you
see
how
this
would
be
a
win
in
any
multitasking
system

come
from

usually
the

has
a

a

you
can
type

debug
to
see
and
a
small
table
of

geometries
it
knows
about

these
are
selectable
using
jumpers
on

sometimes
you
can
enter
them
manually
in

failing
that
you
must
use
a

upgrading
the
processor
on
machines
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
about
upgrading
their
or
class
machine
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
i
looked
into
replacing
the
processor
on
those
machines
and
here
are
the
facts
as
i
understand
them
if
you
have
a
model
or
model
you
can
replace
the
chip
with
either
a
cyrix
chip
for
which
will
increase
your
processing
power
by
about
for
normal
fuctions
and
not
at
all
for
math
functions
this
chip
will
only
run
at
your
original
clock
speed
ie
if
you
have
a
machine
the
cyrix
will
run
at
note
windows
does
not
use
the
math
functions
so
it
is
a
good
upgrade
if
you
are
running
windows
or
you
can
get
a
kingston
platform
for
with
a
on
it
which
will
increase
your
normal
processing
power
by
about
if
you
were
running
at
originally
but
again
it
will
not
increase
the
speed
of
your
math
fuctions
i
think
that
it
will
continue
to
run
at
even
if
your
original
processor
runs
at
a
slower
speed
there
is
also
the
kingston
platform
for
with
a
on
it
this
might
speed
up
your
math
functions
as
well
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
have
a
model
or
other
machine
with
either
an
or
a
nonclock
doubling
ie
it
runs
at
either
or
in
it
then
you
can
get
an
intel
overdrive
chip
which
is
really
an
chip
and
replace
your
chip
with
it
you
should
get
about
better
preformance
for
both
normal
and
math
functions
the
mhz
version
of
the
overdrive
chip
costs
and
the
version
costs
the
replacement
for
the
chip
is
an
espeacially
good
deal
as
it
provides
the
math
coprocessor
which
the
does
not
have
note
that
the
speed
ratings
on
the
overdrive
chips
are
the
maximum
speed
at
which
they
can
run
if
you
have
a
then
the
overdrive
chip
will
run
at
ie
externally
and
internally
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
an
overdrive
chip
which
is
rated
at
faster
then
your
machine
you
will
not
get
faster
performance
you
should
be
able
to
buy
these
chips
from
any
of
the
microchip
merchants
that
advertise
at
the

rationale
the
rationale
for
this
proposal
is
a
need
for
those
interested
or
involved
in
the
publishing
of
cdrom
materials
to
have
a
forum
for
the
discussion
relating
to
their
needs
at
the
moment
the
main
fora
for
such
discussion
are
in
altcdrom
and
compmultimedia
neither
of
which
have
publishing
as
their
focus
some
lists
serve
the
general
cdrom
community
with
focuses
on
library
government
and
network
usage
and
until
several
weeks
ago
none
were
devoted
to
publishing
cdpub
has
just
been
setup
in
any
case
a
list
is
not
and
ought
not
be
a
replacement
for
regular
usenet
newsgroups
the
reason
for
the
division
into
three
groups
is
a
natural
partition
of
interest
between
the
hardware
and
software
topics
and
between
the
two
main
focal
points
of
software
ie
fulltext
and
multimedia
publishing
topics
such
as
cdrom
xa
cdi
cdr
photo
cd
and
other
related
formats
would
be
included
as
well
topics
related
to
cdrom
publishing
that
are
neither
clearly
hardware
or
software
related
such
as
books
copyright
issues
and
other
legal
matters
packaging
distribution
could
be
included
in
the
purvue
of
comppublishcdromsoftware
as
would
any
other
nonhardware
or
multimedia
topic
that
relates
in
some
way
to

in
any
format
and
is
appropriate
to
the

the
main

main
focus
of

would
be
software
that
aids
in
the
multimedia
authoring

publishing
process
audio
and

that
the

npdo
you
have
to
remove

sometimes
depends

derive
their

all

anyone
have

are

however
the
parts
dont
fit
our
local
retailer
apparently
put
one
of
these
together
only
to
discover
that
the
ati
card
wouldnt
run
at
surprise
surprise
actually
after
reading
this
group
im
surprised
that
they
even
have
a
local
bus
running
i
have
a
choice
now
between
basically
the
above
system
but
with
a
with
isa
and
vlb
or
a
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thus
the
nonlocal
bus
version
of
the
ati
card
which
is
better
keeping
in
mind
that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two
tasks
having
in
mind
the
size
of
the
images
my
opinion
is
to
go
with
vlb
it
has
much
more
bandwith
that
eisa
which
in
fact
can
be
utilized
by
the
craphics
card
i
have
not
made
measures
so
someone
else
may
share
experience
on
that
also
the
is
faster
in
the
operations
that
run
off
internal
cache
slightly
slower
off
the
external
and
about
the
same
off
memory
so
my
advice
is
the
were
quite
happy
with
the
ati
card
very
fast
once
the
data
gets
to
it
slow
repainting
images
under
photostyler
that
have
moved
off
screen
or
been
uncovered
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
enough
raw
cpu
when
running
desqviewx
its
sluggish
running
the
local
window
manager
also
many
functions
under
photostyler
take
a
long
time
even
when
the
images
fit
entirely
in
ram
theres
not
enough
memory
in
the
system
desqviewx
and
a
meg
smartdrive
dont
leave
much
room
for
other
apps
photostyler
will
page
to
disk
with
medium
size
images
have
you
tried
running
photostyler
without
the
cache
no
need
to
have
paging
and
cache
both
well
you
might
argue
that
the
paging
is
cached
my
belief
no
measurements
is
that
apps
left
with
more
memory
will
manage
it
better
than
smartdrvexesys
i
have
performed
a
number
of
benchmarks
on
the
ethernet
transfer
rates
this
machine
sustains
only
over
ethernet
while
our
sparcs
sustain
on
the
same
network
going
to
the
bit
version
of
the
smc
card
increases
transfer
rates
to
still
very
slow
especially
when
moving
large
images
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
localbus
ethernet
card
coming
will
it
make
a
difference
im
hoping
so
and
leaning
towards
the
choice
above
for
that
reason
the
bandwidth
theoretical
of
isa
is
over
which
is
far
from
i
tried
my
isa
ide
hard
drive
maxtor
and
got
the
same
results
regardless
of
the
isa
bus
speed
so
i
guess
that
just
the
carddrivers
combination
is
lousy
also
are
there
on
the
horizon
what
about
the
rumors
are
that
if
any
is
the
most
likely
chip
to
come
out
but
note
that
ibm
is
closest
to
the
technology
an
it
will
only
sell
whole
motherboards
so
youll
have
to
upgrade
the
mb
any
information
is
greatly
appreciated
just
some
view
not
much
figures

this

i
ordered
one
of

in

it
was
a
twincom
lightning

that
had
a

over
the

given
the

on

about

i
would
not

ordered
it
had
i
known
this
in

it
arrived
on
time
the
documentation
stated
that
it
would
work
and
was
preconfigured
as
providing
that
was
not
in
use
at
the
same
time
for
several
reasons
i
have
a
serial
card
configured
for
at
the
time
i
installed
the
modem
nothing
was
connected
to
although
the
modem
appeared
to
work
during
every
connection
at
or
it
would
randomly
break
the
connection
and
hang
up
the
phone
after
spending
some

on
the

with
midwests
tech
support
they
suggested
disabling

this
appeared
to
solve
the

problem
but
was
an
unacceptable
long
term
solution
i
had
to
have
and
available
even
though
they
both
would
not
be
in

at

i
called
back
minutes
prior
to
their
closing
and
waited
in
voicemail
hell
listening
to
repeated
advertisements
for
midwest
micro
products
i
was
then
promptly
disconnected
apparently
it
was
quiting
time
and
they
didnt
want
to
be
bothered
with
callers
that
had
been
waiting
on
the

i
called
the

and
asked
the

she
promptly
switched
me

that

wasnt

he
suggested
i
use

nonstandard
irq
settings

i
was
not

should
work
as
originally
configured
conclusion
im
not

the

would
work
ok
in
a
basic
system
but
it
clearly
does
not
work
in
a
multi

like
mine
since
my

is
worth
more

my

that

sitting

other
than

it
ran
pretty

i
bought
a

and
turned
it
on
full
and
set
the
output
directly
on

i
did
finally
get

i

i
see
that
the

of

has
dramatically
dropped
to

the
price
of
the
courier
remains
above
anyone
with
knowledge
of
both
of

or
anyone
that
owns
a

the
courier
is
their
topoftheline
product
thus
the
higher
price
ive
never
taken
a
real
look
at
the
sportster
line
only
couriers
but
from
what
ive
gathered
its
basically
more
of
an
entrylevel
modem
probably
doesnt
meet
the
same
specifications
that
the
courier
does
im
not
sure
if
the
sportster
line
is
fully
dsp
driven
like
the
more
recent
courier
modems
are
so
upgrades
in
the
future
may
be
an
issue
again
take
all
of
the
above
with
a
grain
of
saltive
never
evaluated
the

so
im
going
by
bits

pieces
that
ive
heard
if
you
want
a
real
answer
post
the
question
in

and
youll
find
people
who
have
worked

personally
though
if
i
were
going

id
buy

id
get

you

you

at

in

if
someone

youll
see
a
flurry
of
folks
correcting
them
to
avoid
spreading
faulty
info
the
sportster
at
has
error
control
and
bis
data
compression
just
as
it
does
at
lower
speeds
too
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
either
ccitt
recommendation
or
that
says
that
they
can
only
operate
on
modems
that
are
running
of
course
is
currently
only
standardized
for
operation
on
top
of

its
primary

lapm
but
thats
about
as
far
as
that
goes
and
just
in
case
theres
some
confusion
on
this
are
also
supported
by
the
courier
line
unless
you
have
a
really
ancient
one
the
difference
with
the
courier
is
that
it
can
run
at
and
only
in
the
hst
mode
take
a
second
look
at
the
original
question
in
a
previous
article
holly
ks
says
what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
external
see
the
up
there
the
question
was
not
about
the
courier
hst
modem
or
about
the
courier
dual
standardit
was
about
the
courier
modem
the
modem
in
question
does
not
support
hst
period
it
therefore
does
not
support
the
kb
hst
also
not
all
courier
hst
courier
dual
standard
modems
support
the
kb
version
of
hst
my
dual
standard
only
supports
hst
at
kb
there
are
even
older
models
that
only
run
hst
at
kb
this
is
a
proprietary
mode
of
usr
and
it
will
only
connect
to
another
of
the
same
type
unit
to
achieve
this
speed
hst
is
usrs
proprietary
modulation
scheme
but
were
not
talking
about
hst
were
talking
about
is
most
definitely
not
a
proprietary
modulation
scheme
the
sportster
will
do
asynchronous
transmissions
as
well
as
synchronous
the
hst
is
one
way
only
i
do
hope
you
didnt
mean
for
these
two
sentences
to
be
related
in
some
way
first
off
and
are
both
synchronous
and
asynchronous
this
is
part
of
the
ccitt
recommendation
ie
part
of
the
standard
it
isnt
a
feature
unique
to
the
sportster
i
just
looked
at
the
appropriate
chapter
in
the
courier
ds
manual
second
hst
is
not
one
way
only
more
correctly
put
it
is
an
asymmetrical
modulation
scheme
meaning
it
doesnt
work
at
the
same
speed
in
both
directions
hst
operates
at
in
one
direction
and
has
a
lowspeed
backchannel
in
the
other
direction
the
highspeed
channel
goes
in
the
direction
of
the
higher
data
flow
this
is
fine
if
youre
logged
on
to
say
a
bbs
and
type
one
letter
and
get
screens
of
info
back
transfer

not

of

a
penalty
for
turnaround
time
when
the
highspeed
channel
needs
to
reverse

are
both
symmetrical

they
do
transfer
the
full

third
synchronous
vs
asynchronous
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
symmetrical

are
two
completely
different

there
was

plan
a

the
cost
of

pretty

re
any
info
on
cyrix
chip
it
seems
that
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
regarding
the
cyrix
compatible
and
my
info
comes
directly
from
cyrixs
fast
fax
service
and
also
from
installing
one
of
these
chips
in
an
ibm
model
the
is
a
instruction
set
compatible
cpu
which
fits
into
a
socket
pin
grid
array
or
pga
the
dlc
currently
is
available
in
speeds
the
the
and
the
they
do
not
have
a
coprocessor
on
board
but
any
software
query
will
return
coproc
as
present
i
guess
they
emulate
the
coproc
instructions
math
functions
are
on
the
level
without
the
actual
coprocessor
the
internal
cache
on
the
is
cyrix
literature
claims
a
hit
rate
my
informal
tests
show
that
the
cache
accounts
for
a
performance
boost
when
it
is
enabled
by
software
overall
performance
boost
from
a
to
a
is
about
the
benchmarks
i
used
were
nu
si
and
qaplus
dhrystones
and
whetstones
the
performance
with
the
cache
enabled
is
about
on
a
par
with
my
with
external
cpu
cache
which
is
around
the
performance
for
a
the
computer
runs
noticebly
faster
and
dos
with
dblspace
is
not
complaining
the
company
claims
compatibility
but
i
didnt
test
it
the
is
not
a
chip
as
commonly
thought
the
is
actually
a
small
daughterboard
slightly
larger
than
the
which
contains
the
logic
to
manage
the
clock
doubler
this
board
plugs
into
the
pga
and
the
or
plugs
into
this
board
i
guess
the
board
doubles
the
frequency
apparent
to
the
cpu
and
insert
wait
states
when
access
to
the
rest
of
the
system
is
required
there
are
no
info
available
from
cyrix
there
anyway
the
is
available
for
and
only
double
these
clock
rates
and
you
get
the
and
the
dlcs
if
cyrix
is
planning
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
then
they
need
to
put
out
the
first
i
also
tested
a
motherboard
along
with
a
cyrix
coprocessor
with
external
cache
performance
were
about
faster
than
the
but
still
significantly
slower
than
an
actual
intel
imho
the
dlc
is
a
great
low
price
upgrade
for
people
who
cant
afford
or
cant
install
a
new
motherboard
it
is
definitely
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
but
if
you
need
performance
the
wont
cut
it
im
not
sure
about
the
but
i
think
even
if
it
matches
the
performance
it
wont
beat
it
in
any
significant
way
the
last
time
i
posted
info
about
the
dlc
people
sent
quite
a
bit
of
mail
asking
where
i
got
it
so
here
is
where
i
got
mine
treasure
chest
peripherals
they
advertise
in
the
computer
shopper
the
kit
was
but
i
liked
the
chip
so
much
that
i
found
the
supplier
and
became
a
dealer
if
you
are
interested
in
the
chip
email
me
and
i
can
fax
or
mail
you
more
info
im
well
aware

work

the
realy
biggy
to

about
is
after

goes
away

if
the

should
stop
burn

how
would
you
ever

they
may

that

suggested

it
sounded

you
didnt
give

much
of

chance
to
correct

at

the
fact
that
the

worked
okay
for
you
is
because
it
is
setup
more
for

that
cant

the

that

tells

someone

there
are

need
to
be

what
type

is
the
quantum
i
have
tried
others
but
i
think
that
the
adaptec
is
best
value
for
money
connect
the
drive
to
the
adapter
via
a
scsi
cable
and
the
power
cable
do
i
have
to
worry
about
the
power
supply
i

i
have
watts
and
all
im
powering
are
two

and
the

i
dont

you
can
mix
the
two
types
of
drive
unless
you
have
one
of
the
scsiide

that
is
available
you
will
have
to
turn
your

off
setup
the

what

is
this
i
dont

for
this
drive
instructions
for
drive
type
are
included
with

with
some
it
may
be
a
type
no
matter
what
the
disk
is
with
others
it
may
be

i
had

controller
that
i
had
to
tell

that
no
hard
disk
was
installed
format
and
create

on

do
i
use

i

drives
cant

lowlevel
formatted
is
it
the
same
with

how
exactly
does
fdisk
work
i
have
a
reduced

manual
clone

there

do
i
do
this
do

a

unless
you
have

use

the

slowly
diffuse

this
increases

a

goes

is
there
more

do
you

that
they
had
no
idea
how
it
might
be
done
nor
did
they
particularly
care

ok
heres
my
results
so
far
you
have
to
define
the
monitor
as
lcd
it
doesnt
really
support
analogue
video
input
it
works
but
isnt
very
linear
the
incoming
sync
pulses
need
inverting
this
is
best
achieved
with
either
a
cmos
xor
package
or
a
transistor
inverter
if
you
dont
know
how
to
do
it
dont
even
contemplate
it
itll
only
work
in
standard
vga
mode
ok
having
said
that
im
trying
to
either
find
a
circuit
or
ic
which
will
act

sync
decoder
i
want
somethikng
which
basically
only
detects
the
leading
sync
pulse
edge
and
doesnt
care
about
the
polarity
outputting
the
ve
going
pulses
that
the

requires
there
are

for
doing
this
vga
cards
change
their
sync
polarity
depending
which
mode
theyre

is
while
mvga
is

it
means
i
dont

to
put

toggle

there

you

youll

unfortunately
neither

is

the

is
mostly
wasted
with
these
which
leaves
the
advantage
of
being
able

connect
multiple
devices
to
the
scsi

as
the
only
advantage
however
note
that
you
can
expect
to
pay
a
premium
for
scsi
devices
if
youre
only
going

be
using
msdos
stick

its

is
true
for

generally
you

find

probably
dont

these

these

arent

the

the
problems
are
really
with
the
general
hardware
and
software
design
of
the

eg
no
standards
however
adding
a
busmastering
scsi

is
what
brings
these

to
the
surface
and
makes
them
visible
scsi

a

you

stick
with

if

youll
have

a

give

programmed
to
handle
this
signal
is
usually
up
to
the
operating
system
in
msdos
the
interrupt
vector
is
used
to
store
the
address
of
the
function
that
handles
each
interrupt
now
basic
dos
doesnt
care
whether
the
printer
reports
that
its
ready
to
print
some
more
stuff
or
not
it
simply
ignores
the
interrupt
when
dos
prints
it
looks
at
the
lpt
buffer
if
theres
a
character
there
wait
a
while
and
check
again
if
theres
not
copy
a
new
character
to
the
lpt
port
since
the
irq
is
ignored
as
a
printer
interrupt
its
free
for
use
for
any
other
adapters
in
this
case
the
sb
with
any
multitasking
or
otherwise
advanced
os
this
kind
of
printing
approach
just
doesnt
work
or
more
precisely
it
wastes
a
lot
of
cpu
cycles
hence
you
cant
share
the
irq
with
and
sb
if
youre
running
unix
or
or
whatnot
another
issue
with
the
sb
is
that
only
the
digitized
sound
uses
interrupts
when
the
sb
plays
plain
music
the
cpu
simply
tells
it
what
to
play
until
told
otherwise
with
digitized
sound
the
interrupt
is
required
to
notify
the
cpu
when
the
output
ends
and
new
data
is
needed
you
can
however
hook
two
or
more
com
ports
to
one
interrupt
but
use
them
only
one
at
a
time
this
is
because
the
interrupt
handling
routine
is
same
for
both
ports
and
it
can
see
from
which
port
the
data
came
from
this
of
course
applies
for
some
other
devices
like
lpt
as
well
remember
this
was
greatly
simplified
in
parts
but
i
think
gives
the
general
picture
correctly
enough

hercules
vlb
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
tried
out
a
hercules
graphite
card
a
pretty
nice
board
fairly
fast
and
seemed
quite
compatible
even
seemed
to
handle
the
svga
modes
i
have
whined
about
here
on
occasion
at
the
time
i
was
just
buying
a
vlb
system
so
after
checking
out
the
card
i
sent
it
back
i
wanted
a
vlb
card
and
purchased
a
fahrenheit
vlb
card
this
card
is
fairly
fast
will
do
hz
refresh
at
but
is
not
compatible
with
my
cdroms
the
svga
thing
i
think
i
have
merely
conjectured
that
is
the
cause
of
an
old
graphics
board
being
able
to
run
in
a
higher
resolution
with
those
programs
than
the
modern
boards
i
have
tried
i
have
not
gotten
a
straight
answer
out
of
anybody
the
monitor
i
am
using
it
with
is
a
magnavox
which
also
tops
out
at
hz
so
its
really
a
pretty
good
match
but
that
is
for
my
wife
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
for
myself
and
am
looking
for
a
graphics
card
to
drive
it
i
want
refresh
and
would
really
like
it
to
handle
my
cdroms
i
tried
the
orchid
which
did
neither
of
those
things
though
robert
at
wietek
did
say
that
the
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the
driver
data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
any
info
would
be
most
appreciated

am
looking
for
a

card
to
drive
it
i
want

would
really
like

i
tried
the

did
neither

though
robert
at

did
say
that
the
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the

data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
hmm
your
cdrom
program
must
be
using
some
oddball
vga
modes
i
think
they
are
trying
to
get
it
out
by
the
end
of
this
month
when
it
is
released
though
itll
be
in
limited
quantities
i
think
they
have
quite
a
back
order
right
now
the
megs
version
will
come
out
a
bit
later
since
you
have
a
viewsonic
i
think
it
has
a
horizontal
frequency
right
youre
gonna
love
the
megs
version
it
can
do
at
at
at
at
it
can
also
do

at

bad
i
dont
have
such
a
high
bandwidth
monitor
like
yours
most
of
those
modes
need
a

otherwise
youll
have
to
use

if
you

is
it

does
it
need
any

or
is
it
completely
transparent

board
so
that
i
wont
have

the

yes
its
easy
to

its
just
like
an
ordinary
controller
you
dont
have
to
change
the
bios
config
is
it
transparent
to
the

will
it
work
with
any

or
does
it

explicity
for
the
type

installed
its
transparent
it
works
with

if
you
change

you
only

as
usual
will
it
work
with
a

master

yes
no
problem
with

will
i
need
smartdrive
or
dos

that
depends
you
will
get
a
little
better
performance
if
you
use
smartdrive
and
buffers
in
addition
thats
because
access
to
the
card
through
the

is
slower

i
dont

well
ive
installed
dos
in
three
different
systems
with
and
without
stacker
a
friend
installed
it
in
two
other
systems
both
with
stacker
not
a
single
problem
except
perhaps
some
minor
bugs
with
configsys
menus
hes
right
ya
know
ive
helped
to
install
dos
on
about
computers
now
mine
included
on
one
he
bought
the
stacker
to
doublespace
converter
and
it
worked
fine
rather
he
sent
in
the
coupon
for
the
converter
in
other
cases
ive
run
the
doublespace
installation
without
a
problem
when
compressing
a
new
drive
compressing
free
space
or
whatever
else
seems
to
work
for
me
ofcourse
we
did
not
repeat
not
run
any
program
called
install
or
setup
or
a
very
sophisticated
ai
autoconfiguring
setup
installation
program
that
will
think
for
you
and
do
what
you
never
wanted
to
do
but
couldnt
stop
it
from
doing
well
i
ran
the
normal
setup
thing
and
it
worked
fine
for
whatever
thats
worth
also
dblspace
is
crap
it
writes
about
slower
than
stacker
reads
about
slower
and
compresses
about
less
all
tests
were
made
on
the
same
computer
with
the
same
disk
no
cache
and
the
same
big
files
were
used
couldnt
agree
more
on
my
i
dont
miss
the
speed
its
still
faster
than
a
normal
disk
read
would
be
as
for
the
less
compression
ive
sacrificed
that
in
favor
of
the
convenience
of
having
the
dblspacebin
load
before
anything
else
with
stacker
any
changes
to
your
configsys
or
autoexecbat
meant
rebooting
twice
so
it
could
update
those
personally
im
waiting
for
stacker
to
come
out
and
implement
those
hooks
and
stuff
plus
the
defrag
that
comes
with
dos
is
okay
but
i
much
prefer
compress
from
pctools
for
sheer
bells
and
whistles
plus
defrag
is
sooooo
sloooow
on
a
dblspace
drive
but
dos
is
quite
good

i
honestly
dont
understand

you
had

do

my

i
just
got
a

maxtor
that
i
wanted
to
add
as
a

drive
i
did
change
the

settings
on

to
configure
it
as

but
i
didnt
change
anything
on

any

the

what

i
am

i
am
running

have
the

partitioned

i
have
tried
all

even
changed

if
i
boot
from

everything
works
great
except
the
booting
part
the

doesnt
report

just
hangs
there
does
anyone
have

has
somebody

run

i
was
thinking
that
i
might

is
this
possible
any

heres
another

been

without

no

so
far
when
i
dismantled
it
i
discovered
that
it

really
just
a

phillips
kindly
labelled
the
circuit
board
with
the
rgb
inputs
so
i
connected
it
up
as
a
monitor
and
he
presto
it
worked
sort
of
the
problem
is
that
i
have
no
idea
where
to
connect
the
sync
lines
the
display
rolls
continuously
but
does
change
modes
ok
only
to

useful

any
of
you
wonderful

any
knowledge

tried

he

mike

writes
i
as
a
number
of
poeple
in
this
thread
have
already
written
i
cant
prove
its
true
but
i
believe
it
does
not
actually
use
even
though
that
interrupt
is
supposed
to
be
dedicated
to
to
put
it
a
little
differently
irq
is
the
de
facto
standard
interrupt
assigned
to
be
used
by
the
printer
adapter
to
announce
its
completion
of
some
activity
dos
doesnt
monitor
irq
it
uses
other
means
to
determine
when
its
time
to
send
out
another
byte
to
the
printer
most
all
hardware
printer
adapters
have
the
ability
to
disable
the
use
of
irq
usually
by
merely
breaking
the
connection
between
the
isa
pin
and
the
associated
driver
other
adapters
control
the
irq
line
by
a
tristate
driver
and
by
programming
just
leave
it
in
the
highimpedence
mode
unfortunately
there
are
a
lot
of
adapter
cards
which
use
bistate
drivers
ie
either
assert
high
or
assert
low
for
the
irq
lines
rather
than
tristate
drivers
assert
high
assert
low
or
dont
assert
anything
the
presence
of
such
a
card
on
an
irq
line
precludes
the
use
of
that
irq
by
any
other
adapter
unless
it
is
physically
disconnected
by
a
jumper
incidentally
note
that
theres
no
requirement
that
a
card
hold
the
irq
line
low
when
no
interrupt
is
desired
if
that
were
true
you
would
have
to
somehow
tie
down
all
unconnected
irq
lines
and
that
certainly
isnt
a
requirement
nondos
operating
systems
nt
various
unices
or
whatever
the
proper
plural
of
unix
might
be
require
the
use
of
irq
for

alas
is

know
about

expect

to

for

my
question
is
why
isnt
there
any
substantial
interest
in
developing
the
flopticals
certainly
in
the
uk
the
flopticals
are
about
the
same
price
as
a
cheap
cdrom
now
you
seem
to
be
able
to
get
them
for
around
gbp
however
the
bigger
optical
drives
eg
are
much
more
expensive
around
the
gbp
mark
a
couple
of
questions
that
someone
may
be
able
to
answer
the
flopticals
are
they
direct
drop
in
replacements
for
a
floppy
or
do
they
need
driver
software
etc
ie
do
you
just
rip
out
the
floppy
drive
plug
the
same
cables
into
the
floptical
stick
in
a
floptidisk
and
hey
presto
you
have
a
floppy
this
sounds
far
too
easy
on
the
subject
of
sony
developing
mds
for
computers
i
have
reread
a
pcw
article
on
this
subject
and
there
it
says
that
sony
have
been
doing
optical
drives
for
other
people
for
some
time
and
may
be
about
to
do
a
product
themselves
from
the
article
it
seems
that
the
audio
md
format
is
a
byproduct
of
their
computer
storage
work
the
md
mechanism
is
identical
to
their
mo
computer
optical
drives
a
sony
spokesman
was
quoted
as
saying
that
a
md
disk
would
hold
about
of
data
though
he
refused
to
comment
on
any
possibility
of
this
being
productized
the
article
said
that
one
of
the
problems
holding
back
development
in
this
area
was
lack
of
sensible
standards
plus
there
are
at
least
distinct
optical
storage
mechanisms
around
at
present
given
that
it
probably
needs
mds
being
used
as
a
distribution
medium
to
get
it
into
the
market
and
since
this
has
already
been
cornered
by
cds
it
probably
needs
someone
to
come
in
with
a
very
strong
marketting
lead
to
get

to
get
free
information
from
them
about
their
chips
specifically
their
dotclocks
without
paying
and
signing
nondisclosure
agreements
i
think
they
only
need
a
signing
ie
no
paying
this
still
violates
the
fsfs
policy
of
publically
available
code
this
made
it
impossible
for
the
free
software
foundation
to
provide
xwindows
compatibility
with
these
cards
as
diamond
didnt
want
to
divulge
programming
neccessities
while
this
is
true
there
are
fixes
for
those
who
have
already
bought
diamond
cards
in
linux
for
example
there
are
utilities
that
will
put
the
card
in
vesa
mode
before
invoking
x
of
course
this
means
no
fine
tuning
of
diamond
cards
but
at
least
this
will
allow
those
whore
stuck
with
them
to
use
linuxx
i
agree
with
marks
suggestion
if
you
are
buying
a
video
card
for
specialized
free
software
avoid
diamond
but
if
you
already
have
one
there
may
be
a
fix
that
can
help

re
bios
passwords
some
of
our
students
change
the
ami
bios
passwords
on
a
few
of
our
computers
and
set
it
for
always
what
wed
like
to
know
is
if
there
is
a
way
to
bypass
or
remove
the
password
we
have
tried
switching
bios
but
to
no
avail
the
battery
is
soldered
to
the
bord
an
all
three
machines
is
still
under
guarentee
so
if
that
would
have
help
we
cant
remove
the
batteries
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
way
to
get
around
the
bios
password
except
by
shorting
out
the
power
supply
to
the
cmos
memory
thereby
erasing
it
this
will
remove
the
password
but
it
will
also
destroy
all
the
previous
bios
settings
so
then
youll
have
to
go
and
set
them
all
up
again
on
my
there
is
a
jumper
on
the
motherboard
which
is
provided
for
the
purpose
of
shorting
the
battery
you
just
short
this
jumper
briefly
and
it
interrupts
power
to
the
cmos
long
enough
to
erase
it
i
would
imagine
there
is
something
like
this
on
your
board
too
in
the
future
i
would
suggest
that
you
set
the
password
and
leave
it
on
setup
only
that
way
noone
else
can
go
and
reset
it
or
set
it
to
always
unless
they
know
what
password
you
used
they
had
to
do
this
over
here
too
when
they
got

hi
that
might
look
like
a
dull
request
but
i
have
been
following
this
newgroup
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
it
didnt
help
me
make
my
mind
i
bought
a
new
machine
not
long
ago
after
being
disconnected
from
the
pc
world
for
a
while
i
have
been
running
on
an
xt
till
last
january
the
machine
i
bought
came
equipped
with
a
ati
vga
xl
graphic
card
it
gives
a
very
nice
picture
and
the
windows
drivers
are
pretty
stable
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
quite
slow
i
would
like
to
go
for
a
faster
card
not
in
the
range
i
saw
a
lot
of
comments
on
many
products
over
the
last
weeks
but
didnt
get
an
overall
picture
clear
enough
to
make
a
choice
my
question
is
could
somebody
direct
me
to
a
source
of
information
which
would
help
me
in
my
quest
i
would
like
to
get
information
about
the
refresh
rates
the
various
cards
provide
quality
of
windows
drivers
standard
vga
performance
nonwindows
stuff
direct
me
to
a
magazine
article
or
something
like
that
i
got
winvidzip
info
but
it
is
not
enough
if
you
have
an
isa
card
you
are
really
satisfied
with
it
let
me
know
if
this
information
is
of
any
use
here
is
my
system
configuration
fujikama
isa

contaq

up

i
would
also
like
to
know
if
it
is
a
standard
for
video
drivers
to
allow
screen
dimensioning
and
screen
positioning
by
writing
on

this
is
the
case
with

it
is

the

the

im

by
the

out
at

with

fan
you
can
reach

yes
this
is
a
valid
concern
imho
with
the
directly

units
ive
seen
it
looks
like
if
the

were
to
stop
the
chip
cooling
would
be
a
good
bit
worse
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in
other
words
if
the
fan
stops
the
unit
turns
into
an
insulator
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to
suffer
permanent
damage
not
just
stop

temporarily
i
prefer
to
put
a
stock
fan
off
the
drive
brackets
or
front
panel
to
blow
air
across
the
cpu
depends
a
lot
on
case
and
board
layout
though
my
zeos
tower
case
has
a
passive
heat
sink
on
the
cpu
and
its
located
so
the
front
fan
which
sucks
air
into
the
case
blows
right
on
the
heat
sink
if
that
fan
stops
the
heat
sink
is
still
cooled
by
convection
air
flow
so
should
not
see
too
dramatic
a

the
attached
fans
look
slick
and
work
well
but
im
bothered
by
the
potential
loss
of
cooling
if
the
fan
goes
out
at
least
with
the
power
supply
fan
you
can
reach
back
there
every
few
days
and
feel
the
fan
blowing
yes
this
is
a
valid
concern
imho
with
the
directly
attached
fan
units
ive
seen
it
looks
like
if
the
fan
were
to
stop
the
chip
cooling
would
be
a
good
bit
worse
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in
other
words
if
the
fan
stops
the
unit
turns
into
an
insulator
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to
suffer
permanent
damage
not
just
stop
working
temporarily
a
suggestion

this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
my
friend
claims
that
there
will
be
little
difference
in
the
temperature
of
an
idle
cpu
and
a
cpu
running
a
computationally
intensive
job
from
what
ive
seen
in
coursework
most
cpus
never
actually
idle
they
will
continue
to
service
interrupts
etc
etc
the
clock
will
always
be
running
at
n
mhz
no
matter
what
its
doing
i
suppose
depending
on
the
instruction
the
cpu
may
use
circuitry
which
has
more
transistors
than
other
instructions
but
if
you
consider
the
additional
heat
generated
by
only
a
handful
of
additional
tiny
resistors
and
then
spread
that
heat
dissipation
over
the
cpus
packaging
the
change
in
temperature
to
the
immediate
environment
ie
the
surface
of
the
package
will
be
negligible

general

its
a
teac

i
took
it
out
of
the

noticed
it
was
very
dusty
i
used
a
high

blow
all
this

out

its
quite
clean
now
however
it
didnt
help
the

ive
also
identified
that
when
the

boots

the

seeks
for
a
boot
disk
the
head
movement
during
this
process
is
now
approximately
half
the
length
of
the
original

what
i
mean
is
the

when
the

comes
on
and
the
heads
move
from
their
retracted
position
out
to
the

is
there
anything

i
totally
agree
with
your
friend
since
when
the
cpu
is
apparently
idle
it
is
still
in
fact
churning
away
millions
of
instructions
per
second
checking
for
keyboard
input
for
instance
the
exception
to
this
is
for
cpus
used
in
laptops
where
the
cpu
can
enter
an
idle
state
where
it
is
just
preserving
its
current
status
but
doing
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case
it
needs
a
hardware
interrupt
to
get
it
going
again
actually
the
family
has
a
halt
instruction
that
causes
the
cpu
to
cease
processing
instructions
the
cpu
resumes
processing
either
by
being
reset
or
by
receiving
an
external
hardware
interrupt
this
is
different
from
the
power
management
facilities
victor
mentions
of
course
whether
an
operating
systems
idle
loop
uses
the
halt
instruction
is
another
matter

the
one
that
almost
all

cards
cannot

this
is
due
to
a
screwup
in

design
for

if
your

wants
to
drive
interrupt

then
it
must
hold
a
certain

wire
to

at
all
times
depending
on
whether

it

this
precludes
letting
another

assert

when
two

in

pc
share

its
because
theyre

i
assure
you
that
they

simple
first
andrew
is
correct
although
i
can
see
where
there
might
be
some
confusion
it
is
indeed
possible
to
have
two
cards
configured
to
use
the
same
interrupt
they
can
not
share
the
interrupt
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
possible
to
have
both
cards
active
at
the
same
time
here
is
an
example
for
some
time
i
was
short
of
free
interrupts
i
had
a
tape
controller
not
a
floppy
tape
that
needed
one
of
its
an
old
tape
drive
my
solution
was
to
use
also
used
for
where
my
modem
is
i
did
this
because
i
reasoned
i
would
never
be
using
the
modem
and
the
tape
simultaneously
when
kermit
runs
it
installs
its
own
interrupt
handler
for
and
uses
the
serial
port
if
the
tape
drive
were
to
generate
an
interrupt
kermit
would
not
have
a
clue
what
to
do
withfor
the
tape
controller
and
since
the
tape
controller
would
not
be
serviced
it
would
most
likely
hang
likewise
when
the
tape
backup
software
runs
it
installs
an
interrupt
handler
for
that
handler
wont
do
anything
for
the
serial
port
under
dos
printing
is
not
interruptdriven
instead
the
bios
polls
the
status
of
the
parallel
port
to
determine
when
another
byte
may
be

thats

you
can

it
worked
fine
in

for
a
while
i
was
changing
configurations
and
whatnot
so
much
that
i
decided
to
try
putting
them
on
the
hard
disk
not
only
can
you
copy
them
over
with
one
disk
per
directory
but
if
you
want
to
you
can
simply
copy
them
all
into
one
directory
makes
it
a

nicer

youre

dont

with

when
a
friends
system
crashed
we
restored
from

backup
rather
than
from
the
originals
and
it
worked
fine
this
would

a

then

see

another

ive
been
seeing
all
kinds

complaints

lately
on
here
i
thought
i
post
my
recent
pleasant
experiences
my
machine
this
past
friday
this
was
two
weeks
to
the
day
from
when
i
called
the
order
in
upon
unboxing
it
i
found
everything
to
be
in
perfect
order
all
the
peripherals
i
ordered
were
properly
installed
cdrom
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
gateway
documentation
all
software
came
with
the
original
disks
and
manuals
the
gateway
manual
itself
is
in
a
nice
binder
the
ati
gup
came
with
drivers
all
other
software
i
specified
microsoft
office
was
properly
installed
the
machine
came
right
up
out
of
the
box
and
has
been
performing
flawlessly
its
been
on
all
weekend
and
it
hardly
even
reaches
room
temperature
i
think
the
big
roomy
tower
case
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
its
up
and
running
dos
with
no
problems
ive
also
read
about
some
people
having
problems
with
high
speed
serial
communications
i
used
the
dos
interlink
program
which
lets
me
link
to
my
old
computer
via
a
serial
port
at
baud
it
then
maps
the
other
machines
two
hard
disks
as
my
disks
f
g
you
can
cd
to
these
drives
and
either
run
programs
or
copy
files
its
almost
like
a
peerpeer
lan
except
you
can
also
run
programs
on
the
other
machine
its
not
a
two
way
street
the
other
machine
is
the
server
and
this
machine
is
the
client
so
thats
where
it
seems
to
differ
from
the
peer
to
peer
stuff
for
a
bundled
dos
utility
its
very
impressive
my
took
about
minutes
to
back
up
of
data
i
also
bypassed
any
potential
gateway
monitor
problems
by
taking
the
credit
and
applying
it
towards
a

i
love
this

says
so
by
going
mailorder
through
gateway
i
save
plus
i
get
technical
support
over
the
phone
free
software
package
have
fun
trying
to
get
hold
of
technical
support
over
the
phone
at
least
locally
you
can
walk
right
up
to
the
dealer
and
tell
him
what
is
wrong
and
he
has
to
fix
it
phone
support
is
quick
and
competent
from
many
mail
order
firms
but
not
so
quick
and
not
so
competent
from
others
gateway
included
but
my
experience
with
computer
retailers
which
is
significant
has
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
sales
personnel
and
retailtechnical
personnel
are
forbidden
to
actually
learn
about
the
products
they
sell
talk
about
incompetent
ok
so
a
few
percent
of
their
answers
are
correct
but
those
salesmen
dont
even
realize
how
stupid
they
are
ok
ill
settle
down
now
let
me
catch
my
breath
fact
retail
stores
never
provide
a
better
value
in
terms
of
price
per
product
retail
outlets
are
desirable
however
to
those
people
who
arent
interested
in
learning
about
computers
enough
to
make
their
own
decisions
this
is
fine
for
example
most
of
my
education
about
carpeting
wall
paper
lawn
mowers
microwave
ovens
etc
has
come
from
sales
personnel
i
assume
i
must
be
an
idiot
but
i
dont
care
about
those
things
i
do
however
care
about
my
computer
ie
i
demand
features
and
performance
and
ill
be
damned
if
ill
pay
some
highschool
drop
out
commission
on
an
overrated
overpriced
system
and
in
the
process
be

i
recently
bought
a
used
seagate
hard
drive
the
guy
told
me
that
it
had
been
fully
tested
and
that
it
was
good
i
took
it
home
to
install
in
my
compaq
portable
ok
im
a
little
behind
in
technology
i
already
had
an
mfm
controller
i
installed
the
drive
and
powered
up
the
system
i
got
a
post
error
my
controller
is
a
western
digital
rev
c
as
i
said
above
the
drive
is
a
seagate
the
system
is
a
compaq
portable
circa
ah
finally
a
question
i
can
answer
i
mess
with
this
older
stuff
alot
kinda
fun
first
problem
i
can
forsee
is
that
the
will
not
be
compadible
with
that
wd
card
unless
it
has
the
right
bios
rom
check
the
numbers
on
it
it
should
be
the
only
nonsmt
chip
on
the
board
slightly
below
center
and
left
the
bios
should
read
either
or
if
the
last
digits
are
you
got
problems
controller
jumpers
are
set
as
follows
represents
jumper
looks
right
and
are
factory
jumped
with
a
trace
between
pins
and
to
select
the
primary
controller
address
the
drive
jumpers
are
as
follows
represents
jumper
looks
right
art
deleted
here
are
my
questions
are
the
drive
and
controller
compatible
w
each
other
i
notice
you
left
out
the
jumper
table
settings
those
are
what
control
what
drive
the
controller
thinks
it
has
if
you
have
the
rom
set
it
like

if
you
have
the

and
ill
have
to
look
up
how
to
do
it
i
dont
have
the
big
book
right
here
are
the
jumpers
on
the
carddrive
set
correctly
see
above
you
might
have
problems
if
the
jumpers
are
not
right
also
at
the
risk
of
being
insulting
make
sure
the
cables
are
on
right
and
good
on
the
jumper
on
the
try
moving
it
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
drive
its
one
or
the
other
the

cable
goes

thrown
it
on
a

times

banged
my
head
for
a
day
is
my
systems
bios
in
need
of
an
upgrade
dunno
ibm
roms
had
to
be

than
a
quick
way
to
check
is
to
boot
dos
and
run
debug
enter
d

the
is
the

this
will
return
the

if
its

how

somewhere
there
exist
programmable

eg
one
can
program
displays
on

to
show
some

it

any

reference
in

anyone
have
any
ideas
except
that
they
may
encode

by
the
sequences

at

was

assume

the

here
is
that
an

definitely
go
for

is

greater

has
the

has

i
went
buying
simms
recently
and
the
sales
person
told
me
that
the
mg
are
simms
and
simms
and
one
cannot
use
them
interchan
mg
if
you
use
one
you
have
to
use
all
of
the
same
type
dont
believe
everything
you
are
told
i
can
tell
you
that
mixing
them
between
banks
ok
and
i
cant
see
why
mixing
in
one
bank
is
not
unless
they
are
of
different
speeds
eg
mixing
of
and
simms
in
one
bank
the
two
only
differ
in
the
type
of
chips
it
uses
assuming
that
the
simms
are
bit
wide
here
is
the
two
equivalent
configuration
the
simm
uses
two
wide
of
nibbles
and
one
wide
chip
for
a
total
of
wide
the
simm
uses
nine
wide
chips
these
are
equivalent
because
of
the
way
that
it
is
pinned
on
the
simm
board
at
the
simm
interface
they
both
act
as
wide
simms
sorry
if
too
techie
for
ya
mg
similarly
one
cannot
plug
in
two
simms
and
one
simms
to
gi
mg
the
system
a
total
of
meg
why
is
that
so
if
my
system
supports
mg
of
meg
it
has
simm
slots
can
i
plug
in
simms
to
give
my
mg
that
sounds
correct
the
problem
is
that
if
your
computer
takes
wide
simms
you
can
not
mix
different
sizes
in
one
bank
why
you
ask
simple
if
you
understand
why
there
is
banks
assuming
you
have
a
cpu
or
the
data
bus
eg
the
mechanism
to
retrieve
data
from
memory
is
wide
so
the
computer
expects
to
see
bits
when
it
asks
for
data
to
get
that
bandwidth
wide
the
motherboard
links
one
bit
is
not
data
but
parity
so
i
will
ignore
that
in
this
simple
explaination
to
get
bits
that
means
that
a
simm
in
a
bank
stores
only
of
the
bit
wide
data
if
you
have
a
bus
two
simms
are
linked
together
to
get
wide
data
which
is
the
reason
why
banks
are
simms
wide
and
banks
are
simms
wide
if
your
computer
required
eg
wide
data
with
parity
bits
used
in
some
and
asts
you
could
upgrade
by
one
simm
at
a
time
hope
that
this
message
is
not
over
your
head
but
the
answer
to
your
question
was
not
simple
i
could
of
just
said
because
i
said

help
needed
hello
i
hope
somebody
out
here
can
help
me
i
am
currently
working
on
a
project
where
i
am
trying
to
communicate
from
an
ibm
with
phoenix
bios
using
c
to
a
board
that
i
made
with
an
intel
cpu
with
uart
chip
the
board
works
fine
with
the
transmit
command
and
terminal
emulation
mode
of
kermit
but
there
seems
to
be
something
wrong
with
the
initialization
or
protocol
used
when
i
try
c
i
need
to
access
the
unit
i
built
using
c
because
i
have
a
sizable
chunk
of
c
code
that
i
will
be
using
to
perform
calculations
and
operations
that
will
be
very
difficult
to
code
in
assembly
language
for
the
i
have
included
the
assembly
code
that
i
am
running
and
the
c
code
that
i
am
trying
to
use
if
anyone
can
show
me
something
that
i
am
doing
blatantly
incorrectly
or
that
i
am
missing
because
of
my
lack
of
knowledge
about
serial
communications
please
email
me
i
wrote
the
assembly
language
to
wait
for
a
character
to
be
received
and
then
to
check
it
against
the
character
if
a
is
received
the
leds
will
indicate
this
two
c
programs
that
i
have
written
do
nothing
but
set
up
com
port
and
send
the
character
one
uses
the
bioscom
function
in
biosh
the
other
uses
the
software
interrupt
function
in
dosh
i
have
triple
checked
the
baud
rate
the
parity
none
the
stop
bits
the
character
length
bits
and
the
interrupt
calls
for
currently
i
am
at
a
loss
as
to
what
may
be
wrong
any
hardware

out
there
want

both

regarding

you
only
have

ran

to
see
if

could
access

lo
and
behold
the
primary

partition
was
intact
created
by
dos
no
less
i
didnt
think
you
could
go
over
a
partition
in
the
older
doses
i
could
be
wrong
i
then
tried
to
remove
the
primary
partition
which
it
wouldnt
allow
me
to
do
i
am
unaware
of
anything
special
that
has
to
be
done
with
a

i
kinda
expected
it
to
work
just
like
an

for

any

would
be
greatly
appreciated

the
tape
these
are
the
marker
holes
which
let
the
tape
drive
know
when
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
tape
the
holes
are
spaced
a
couple
of
inches
apart
my
best
guess
is
that
the
drive
finds
the
first
marker
and
then
stops
on
the
second
marker
anyhow
if
the
tape
has
the
holes
then
check
to
see
if
the
mirror
on
the
tape
is
clean
the
function
of
the
mirror
is
to
detect
the
marker
holes
the
tape
drive
shines
a
light
at
the
mirror
and
has
a
pickup
in
the
area
where
the
reflection
would
come
out
when
the
hole
goes
by
the
pickup
detects
the
light
that
was
allowed
to
pass
and
it
knows
when
to
stop
if
the
mirror
is
dirty
or
out
of
alighment
unlikely
since
it
is
made
into
the
case
you
might
have
a
problem
detecting
the
end
of
the
tape
if
the
tape
drive
does
it
on
all
tapes
and
the
tapes
all
look
good
then
either
the
pickup
or
the
led
of
the
sensor
system
has
failed
or
is
dirty
if
you
open
the
drive
door
you
will
see
the
sensor
assembly
to
the
left
of
the
rw
head
assembly
if
it
looks
clean
and
nothing
is
in
its
way
then
the
drive
may
need
to
be
serviced
it
is
possible
that
the
led
is
burned
out
or
the
sensor
is
out
if
it
is
still
in

you
might
be
able

ram
boards
on
a
hello
i
have
a
isa
machine
with
pheonix
bios
currently
i
have
megabytes
of
ram
installed
via
eight
mg
simms
on
the
motherboard
ie
both
banks
are
full
and
there
is
no
space
for
more
simms
i
am
thinking
of
running
on
my
machine
and
possibly
linux
with
x
windows
and
i
know
that
more
ram
would
be
helpful
however
with
simms
the
only
solution
i
can
see
is
to
sell
my
megs
for
about
and
by
simms
for
about
used
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
cant
afford
the
price
right
now
the
entire
process
of
selling
ram
and
buying
it
used
probably
means
that
the
machine
might
be
down
for
a
number
of
days
which
i
would
rather
avoid
so
my
question
is
do
the
at
ram
boards
that
plug
into
a
free
slot
work
well
with
a
isa
machine
i
have
seen
some
being
sold
used
for
about
with
mg
with
space
for
another
if
these
boards
do
work
how
do
they
do
it
is
a
device
driver
needed
or
will
the
bios
pickup
the
extra
ram
as
it
does
with
the
simms
on
the
mother
board
i
know
that
the
isa
expansions
slots
are
and
simm
memory
is
bits
so
probably
all
of
this
is
just
wishful
thinking
however
any
help
is
truly
appreciated

was
to
speed

that

this
is
espically
useful
in

there

which
causes

for
more

a

supposed
to
be

to
be

it

a

controller
interface
in

tends
to
be
very

transfer

it

the
problem
becomes
can
the

keep

and
that
is
where
the

and
cost
of

from
not
the

itself
but
more
and
more
from

mechanisims
to
use
the

put
the
cost
of
scsi
interface
is
a
self
fulliling
prophisy
few
people
buy
scsi
because
it
is
so
expencive
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convices
makes
that
mass
producing
scsi
which
would
reduce
its
cost
is
unwarented
and
so
scsi
is
expencive
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
items
sold
the
less
each

has
to
bare
the
brunt

so
the

this
post
because
the
support
rep
told
me
that
i
would
have
to
pay
shipping
not
only
for
the
returned
system
but
also
the
two
hard
drive
controllers
they
had
sent
me
fortunately
i
just
spoke
to
customer
service
and
they
are
going
to
have
ups
come
and
pick
everything
up
gratis
the
only
downside
is
that
now
i
have
to
order
another
computer
i
would
really
like
to
try
gateway
again
im
just
very
turned
off
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
try
and
get
through
to
customer
service
or
tech
support
again
i
think
their
products
are
great
for
the
most
part
but
im
beginning
to
wonder
if
the
savings
are
worth
the
potential
aggravation
are
other
mail
order
companies
as
difficult
to
contact
i
know
gateway
is
booming
and
for
good
reason
but
i
dont
know
if
i
can
take
it
again
oh
well
i
feel
better

adaptec
problem
hello
i
have
recently
suffered
from
various
problems
concerning
an
adaptec
controller
problem
floppy
disk
drive
doesnt
work
theres
apparently
at
least
two
jumpers
on
the
controller
that
affect
the
floppy
disk
drive
unfortunately
i
have
located
only
one
of
them
in
the
lower
front
corner
i
would
like
to
know
if
there
are
any
other
such
jumpers
and
possibly
where
they
are
located
problem
my
hard
disks
refuse
to
boot
with
my
two
scsi
hds
rodime
miniscribe
i
get
a
message
missing
operating
system
even
though
the
disks
have
been
formatted
with
the
same
controller
and
they
damn
sure
have
an
operating
system
on
them
if
i
boot
from
a
quantum
i
might
get
as
far
as
getting
the
msdos
version
information
this
might
of
course
be
due
to
incombatible
memory
drivers
are
there
any
jumpers
that
could
affect
the
hd
causing
such
errors
thanks
in
advance

games
are
especially
bitchy
about
having

my

was
to
switch
the

irq
which
is
unreserved

contemporary

using

for

went
out
with

dont
put

if
you
have

get
a

this

as

also
use

there
is
one
disadvantage
some

assume

it

i
think
with

it
works
only
in

and
not
much
use
since
just
about
any
application
will
set
the

to
something
else
especially
if
it
wants
to
do

i
suppose
anyway
is
there
any
way
that
i
can
use
this

a

if

grubb
writes
point
of
view
why
does
scsi
have
an
advantage
when
it
comes
to
multi
tasking
data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on
the
drive
can
scsi
find
it
faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive
and
into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
so
at
its
lowest
setting
interface
in
asynchronous
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
as
implimented
on
what
system
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
through
put
given
the
original
question
scsi
used
only
as
a
single
hard
drive
controller
is
it
then
necessary
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at
least
maybe
megssec
for
the
scsi
choice
to
make
any
sence
what
does
a
meg
megssec
scsi
drive
cost
the
cost
of
scsi
interface
is
a
self
fulliling
prophisy
few
people
buy
scsi
because
it
is
so
expencive
for
the
pc
which
in
turn
convices
makes
that
mass
producing
scsi
which
would
reduce
its
cost
is
unwarented
and
so
scsi
is
expencive
that
is
the
effect
of
the
rule
of
scale
the
more
items
sold
the
less
each
item
has
to
bare
the
brunt
the
cost
of
manufacture
and
so
the
less
each
item
has
to
cost
the
original
cga
cart
back
in
was
i
think
the
original
ega
card
or
pga
was
scsi
has
stood
relatively
alone
in
not
coming
down

because

talking
about

sparc

or

your

that
is

of

buying

over
the

scsi
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
come
down
in
price
i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented

highway

i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better

should
be
glad
they
didnt
just
say
buy
the
memory
from
us
or
something
like
that
the
one
thing
that
i
was
puzzled
by
was
why
there
was
not
a
color
mode
on
the
thing
either
in
full
screen
or
enlarged
desktop
mode
my
ati
ultra
plus
can
handle
that
given
of

all
the
buys
you
on
the
fahrenheit
is
just
one
more
mode
geez
had
i
known
i
wouldnt
have
bothered
i
asked
them
why
and
all
i
got
was
your
point
is
well
taken
but
orchids
software
developers
are
busy
with
other
projects
so
to
get
to
the
point
finally
are
there
any
drivers
out
there
that
can
handle
high
res
hicolor
modes
id
love
to
get
another
card
but
perhaps
it
will
have
to
wait
until
the
next
generation
of
cards
comes
out
since
this
card
came
bundled
with
my
system
and
its
not
so
easy
to
exchange
these
things
unless
theyre
broken
if
you
want
these
modes
steer
away
from
orchids
cards
ie
vlb
or
vavlb
at
least
until
their
developers
are
less
busy
if
the
magazines
are
to
believed
ive
only
seen
one
product
thus
far
which
can
handle

although
evenn
that
might
be
a
misprint
please
if
there
are

semigeneric

know

did

your

locks
up
you
have

if
you
overdrive

that

the

thing

check

irq
and

my
solution
was
to
switch
the
interrupt
to
irq
which
is
unreserved
in
contemporary
computers
using
irq
for
the
drives
went
out
with
the
xt
architechture
not
completly
true
for
at
class
and
later
machines
is
reserved
for
since
its
rare
to
have
a
second
parallel
port
in
a
pc
its
usually
a
good
safe
choice
if
you
need
an
interrupt
on
the
other
hand
we
just
ran
into
a
problem
with
that
here
at
work
on
a
gateway
computer
it
has
a
modem
on
a
mouse
on
and
the
other
serial
port
was
set
to
which
normally
uses
the
same
interrupt
as
we
had
a
real
fight
with
a
board
when
trying
to
use
and
discoverd
the
problem
was
that
gateway
had
set
it
up
such
that
used
as
soon
as
we
disabled
our

went

cache
or
micronics
eisavlb
motherboard
this
might
be
a
silly
question
but
i
have
to
ask
it
anyway
i
am
in
the
process
of
purchasing
an
eisavl
bus
computer
and
i
found
two
places
that
sell
machines
that
have
what
i
want
and
have
the
same
price
the
first
is
ares
and
they
use
a
cache
motherboard
thats
the
brand
of
the
motherboard
with
opti
chip
set
the
other
is
micron
formerly
edge
technology
and
they
use
the
micronics
eisavlb
motherboard
i
said
that
this
might
be
a
silly
question
since
i
believe
that
micronics
is
a
very
well
known
motherboard
manufacturer
while
i
never
heard
of
cache
i
am
however
leaning
towards
the
ares
machine
because
my
impression
is
that
they
are
known
for
building
good
solid
machines
and
they
have
good
tech
support
hr
dayswk
and
a
better
warrantee
years
micron
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
recently
aquired
edge
technologies
and
im
not
sure
how
much
i
should
trust
the
company
i
would
really
appreciate
any
input
on
this
is
the
micron
machine
the
clear
choice
does
anyone
know
anything
positive
or
negative
about
either
company
has
anyone
ever
heard
of
cache
motherboards
should
i
go

dont

serious
these

may
be
i
would
appreciate
some

who
have
used

btw
this
is
on
a

i
have
a
similar

colorado
on

the
problems
are
o
firstly
gateway
shipped
me
only
mb
tapes
even
though
the
drive
is
a
mb
unit
when
i
called
to
complain
they
only
said
thats
all
we
carry
and
with
compression
you
can
fit
mb
on
one
tape
maybe
so
but
then
why
did
i
pay
extra
for
the
large
capacity
tape
drive
you
got
suckered
in
the
same
way
i
did
silly
me
believing
that
the
logo
on
the
front
meant
actual
carrying
capacity
the
people
who
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
a

call
it
marketing
lawyers
who
prosecute
it
call
it

perhaps
we
can
have
a

of
other
duped
buyers
march

o
i
have
about
mb
of
data
on
my
c
drive
i
choose
the
spaceoptimizing
compression
scheme
and
started
a
full
backup
the
software
estimated
it
would
take
about
minutes
it
took
hours
does
this
sound
about
right
this
is
a
bit
long
my
system
takes
about
minutes
to
do
the
same
thing
usually
hours
particularly
if
the
tape
is
grinding
away
the
whole
time
means
that
your
block
size
for
the
write
is
too
small
is
there
any
way
to
change
the
block
size
or
write
buffer
size
so
its
bigger
o
during
the
backup
about
a
dozen
files
came
up
with
access
denied
errors
most
of
these
were
in
cwindowssystem
commdrv
keyboarddrv
shelldll
etc
but
also
cwindowsprogmanexe
and
a
couple
of
files
in
the
ctape
directory
anyone
else
had
this
happen
this
is
because
the
files
are
opened
by
dos
the
files
in
the
tape
directory
are
likely
the
executable
file
or
the
configuration
file
for
the
tape
system
i
would
recommend
running
the
backup
from
dos
so
it
will
make
a
complete
backup
of
the
tape
directory
thanks
for
any
and
all
feedback
on
this
system
id
also
appreciate
hearing
of
good
sources
for
blank
tape
cartridges
preferably
mb
size
the
cartridges
wont
do
you
any
good
since
the
drive
wont
write
of
physical
data
on

what

a

megssec
scsi
drive
cost
since
the
quadra
is
the
only
mac
able
to
deal
with
and
hard
drives
start
at
i
have
no
idea
for
the
mac
i
have
the
following
these
are
all
external
etc
so
for
the
mac
goes
down
in
pricemb
as
hard
drive
size
goes
up
and
i
assume
the
same
for
the
pc
world
i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
well
scsi
is
also
a
floppy
drive
interface
in
the
mac
since
scsi
is
the
inteface
for
any
noncard
nonmodem
notkeyboard
device
the
id
is
used
for
the
floppy
drive
called
cpu
in
all
identifiers
this
allows
cross
drive
interfacing
as
fast
as
the
os
program
cpu
scsi
and
drive
can
handle
itthis
shows
up
best
in
the
quatra
line
in
the
ibm
that
uses
scsi
for
the
floppy
drive
this
should
happen
as
well
also
scsi
is
not
just
drives
but
printers
scanners
expandsion
cards
this
showed
up
for
the
plus
as
the
nubus
cage
cdrom
etc
ide
seems
to
be
mainly
hard
drives
as
for
specs
nobody
has
given
me
any
and
i
cant
find
any
besides
the
advertizments
call
ide
the
at
interface
make
of
that
what
you
will
scsi
is
a
jack
of
all
trades
and
ide
is
a
master
of
one
this
alone
puts
scsi
above
ide
blows
ide
out
of
the
water
remember
scsi
was
used
in
high
priced
machines
until
about
months
ago
when
the
mac
prices
came
down
to
earth
so
the
rule
of
scale
still
played
and
scsi
remained
high
costcheap
seems
to
mean
chezzy
in
the
high
end
computer
world
at
times
and
this
more
than
anything
else
proably
kept
scsi
off
into
the
statosphere
price
wise
scsi
came
from
the
high
end
computer
world
with
multitasking
os
were
the
standard
for
the
most
part
of
all
the
interface
next
could
have
used
it
choose
scsi
in
and
mode
scsi
is
a
multitasking
os
desined
interface
while
ide
and
scsi
are
braindead
run

re
joystick
suggestions
it
depends
on
what
youd
like
your
joystick
for
ive
seen
gravis
joysticks
at
radio
shack
they
seemed
flimsy
and
didnt
fit
well
in
my
hand
i
have
heard
on
csipgames
that
they
dont
last
well
less
than
a
year
on
flightsims
one
redeeming
feature
does
seem
to
be
the
ability
to
adjust
the
tension
of
the
stick
i
recently
purchased
a
ch
flightstick
there
arent
any
suction
cups
and
no
tension
adjusters
but
otherwise
it
seems
to
be
an
excellent
joystick
im
currently
using
it
for
the
wing
commander
series
and
red
baron
works
quite
well
the
large
base
does
not
require
a
steadying
hand
and
so
leaves
it
free
the
buttons
provide
good
tactile
response
you
can
hear
and
feel
them
well
there
are
other
models
made
by
ch
that
can
go
up
or
down
in
features
for
price
comparison
gravis
analogue
joysticks
sell
for
here
compared
to
the
i
paid
for
a
ch
flightstick
i
think
the
extra
is
worth
it
just
in
feel
best
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
a
salesperson
to
let
you
try
them
out
or
at
least
feel
it
before
you
buy
just
another
note
analogue
joysticks
are
best
for
flightsims
or
something
that
needs
sensitive
touch
if
youre
only
playing
games
such
as
castle
wolfenstein
or
some
other
game
that
only
uses
digital
input
ie
only
up
down
left
etc
instead
of
how
much
right
you
might
want
to
look
into
a
gravis
gamepad
they
look
like
a

pad

of

needed

also
you
may
have
noticed
that
installing
windows
makes
your
pc
run
much
slower
even
when
youre
not

methods
of
speeding
it
up
are
discussed

configuration
the
windows

program
adds
the
smartdrive
disk
cache
to
your
configsys
and
autoexecbat
files
if
you
follow
the
instructions
youll
notice
that
youll
need
to
use
doublebuffering
with
smartdrive
this
is
the
default
setup
youll
also
notice
that
your
system
runs
much
much
slower
in
both
windows
and
msdos
see
the
section
called
windows
runs
slowly
for
some
ways
of

your

up

configuration
to
get
the
adaptec
to
work
with
windows
make
sure
that
the
section
of
the
systemini
file
contains
the
entry
virtualhdirqoff
i
believe
that
the
windows
install
program
automatically
adds
this
entry
to
systemini
but
im
not
sure
if
this
doesnt
work
for
you
you
might
want
to
try
adding
some
more
lines
virtualhdirqoff
systemrombreakpointfalse
you
probably
dont
need
the
above
lines
though
the
systemrombreakpoint
entry
is
used
to
enable
support
for
memory
managers
like
only
needed
if
you
use
such
programs
windows
runs
slowly
once
you
do
get
windows
running
with
the
chances
are
that
your
system
is
running
much
slower
than
before
if
its
not
its
probably
because
you
happen
to
be
using
version
in
your
configsys
file
congratulations
this
appears
to
be
a
winning
solution
you
are
very
lucky
whether
your
luck
will
hold
out
remains
to
be
seen
if
your
system
is
running
much
slower
than
before
this
is
almost
definitely
caused
by
smartdrive
with
doublebuffering
according
to
the
windows
documentation
and
the
microsoft
technical
note
smartdrive
double
buffering
required
with
you
must
use
smartdrive
with
doublebuffering
enabled
while
this
works
it
really
slows
down
your
pc
i
once
estimated
that
this
slowed
my
pc
down
by
a
factor
of
five
as
i
consider
this
unacceptable
i
looked
for
other
solutions
unfortunately
you
cannot
just
disable
doublebuffering
if
you
do
windows
in
enhanced
mode
will
not
work
and
you
might
even
destroy
the
contents
of
your
hard
disk
by
trying
to
run
windows
what
you
can
do
is
one
of
the
following
use
other
drivers
that
provide
doublebuffering
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
unbelievable
slowness
in
smartdrive
is
caused
either
by
horribly
inefficient
doublebuffering
or
by
a
bug
in
smartdrive
use
a
driver
that
provides
vds
services
vds
stands
for
virtual
dma
services
this
is
a
standard
which
is
supported
by
windows
that
allows
busmastering
disk
controllers
like
the
to
work
with
windows
after
trashing
my
hard
disk
countless
times
i
found
the
following
solutions
none
of
which
require
using
smartdrive
note
however
that
i
am
now
getting
occasional
parity
errors
which
are
probably
not
caused
by
these
solutions
but
might
be
see
below
while
the
following
does
not
require
smartdrive
using
some
kind
of
disk
cache
utility
is
strongly
recommended
as
this
makes
windows
run
much
much
faster
if
you
do
not
have
the
driver
or
you
do
not
need
aspi
functions
for
controlling
a
cdrom
tape
drive
more
than
two
physical
hard
disks
etc
you
can
add
the
scsihasys
driver
to
your
configsys
file
eg
drivercscsihasys
windows
needs
the
option
this
driver
must
be
loaded
into
low
memory
it
cannot
be
loaded
into
high
memory
and
it
occupies
about
as
of
november
the
scsihasys
driver
could
be
obtained
from
the
adaptec
bbs
at
hopefully
its
still
there
if
you
need
aspi
functions
and
have
the
driver
version
or
you
can
use
both
the
and
scsihasys
drivers
in
your
configsys
file
eg
drivercscsihasys
amazingly
enough
the
scsihasys
driver
can
also
be
loaded
high
assuming
you
have
dos
i
would
have
thought
that
this
would
crash
my
system
but
it
doesnt
i
asked
adaptecs
technical
support
about
this
and
they
said
that
loading
scsihasys
high
should
be
fine
as
long
as
is
loaded
low
on
my
system
not
using
scsihasys
with
would
occasionally
cause
windows
to
crash
upon
restarting
or
exiting
windows
with
the
additional
result
of
a
corrupted
disk
some
of
my
cwindowsgrp
files
would
be
corrupted
for
me
these
crashes
usually
occurred
while
making
a
different
program
from
progmanexe
the
default
windows
shell
and
viceversa
this
is
the
reason
scsihasys
may
be
necessary
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
if
scsihasys
is
necessary
with
versions
of
earlier
than
note
that
many
people
can
use
or
without
scsihasys
they
do
not
seem
to
have
any
problems
at
all
i
consider
these
people
lucky
others
like
me
have
had
all
sorts
of
problems
in
my
opinion
the
best
but
not
necessarily
the
easiest
solution
is
to
upgrade
to
the
scsihasys
driver
is
no
longer
needed
unfortunately
while
you
could
get
previous
upgrades
from
the
adaptec
bbs
the
driver
is
not
available
from
the
adaptec
bbs
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
only
three
ways
to
get
a
copy
you
can
buy
the
new
as
of
november
adaptec
ez
scsi
driver
kit
which
supposedly
includes
as
well
as
other
drivers
such
as
cdrom
drivers
i
believe
the
list
price
is
around
if
you
already
have
a
copy
of
an
older
version
of
you
can
supposedly
contact
adaptec
to
upgrade
it
to
ez
scsi
for
around
a
copy
of
is
included
in
central
point
pc
tools
for
msdos
note
that
the
documentation
and
driver
are
stored
in
different
directories
note
further
that
only
is
included
the
cdrom
drivers
and
drivers
to
support
more
than
two
hard
disks
are
not
included
this
is
where
i
obtained
my
copy
of
note
however
that
i
am
now
getting
occasional
parity
errors
with
windows
in
all
probability
defective
hardware
in
my
pc
is
causing
this
as
i
upgraded
my
motherboard
just
after
i
found
the
above
solutions
however
because
these
parity
errors
occur
only
during
disk
accesses
there
is
a
very
small
but
definite
possibility
that
the
parity
errors
are
driverrelated
for
example
changing
the
bus
onoff
timing
for
certain
disk
transfers
might
cause
this
ive
run
various
memory
tests
for
hours
at
a
time
and
these
tests
have
found
no
problems
this
problem
is
probably
caused
by
memory
with
marginal
timing
requirements
which
cause
parity
errors
during
disk
transfers
this
is
why
the
memory
tests
didnt
find
any
problems
the
problems
show
up
only
under
disk
io
however
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
devices
there
are
two
possible
problems
with
using
the
adaptec
with
a
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
device
such
as
the
colorado
memory
systems
jumbo
tape
backupsrestores
can
take
a
very
long
time
the
tape
drive
constantly
starts
stops
starts
stops
etc
tape
operations
may
be
erratic
or
encounter
too
many
tape
errors
this
problem
might
be
caused
by
defective
hardware
on
my
however
ive
heard
of
other
people
having
similar
problems
and
so
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
is
not
a
hardware
problem
on
my
tape
backupsrestores
take
a
long
time
if
you
have
a
floppycontrollerbased
tape
backup
device
you
may
have
to
adjust
the
adaptec
bus
onoff
timing
for
best
results
when
using
the
tape
drive
normally
while
doing
a
tape
backup
or
restore
the
tape
drive
motor
should
be
continuously
running
with
only
an
occasional
pause
however
the
default
bus
timing
on
the
adaptec
may
cause
the
tape
drive
motor
to
start
and
stop
start
and
stop
every
few
seconds
this
causes
needless
wear
to
the
tape
and
tape
drive
however
note
that
a
dirty
tape
head
or
a
defective
tape
drive
can
also
cause
this
make
sure
your
tape
heads
are
clean
this
also
causes
the
tape
backup
or
restore
to
take
much
much
longer
than
necessary
the
problem
here
is
that
these
tape
backups
use
the
floppy
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memory
tofrom
the
tape
drive
and
the
adaptec
uses
dma
to
transfer
data
in
memory
tofrom
the
hard
disk
the
floppy
dma
needs
to
feed
data
to
the
tape
drive
at
a
certain
rate
if
the
tape
drive
is
not
fed
data
quickly
enough
by
the
floppy
dma
the
tape
drive
stops
rewinds
a
bit
and
restarts
once
enough
data
is
eventually
fed
to
it
the
default
bus
timing
on
the
adaptec
which
is
really
dma
timing
is
too
large
for
example
when
a
backup
is
done
data
has
to
be
transferred
from
a
hard
disk
to
memory
and
then
from
memory
to
the
tape
because
the
default
timing
on
the
adaptec
hogs
the
memory
too
much
too
much
time
is
spent
transferring
data
from
a
hard
disk
to
memory
not
enough
time
is
spent
transferring
data
from
memory
to
the
tape
drive
as
a
result
the
tape
drive
constantly
starts
and
stops
because
data
is
not
fed
to
it
quickly
enough
the
solution
is
to
change
the
adaptecs
bus
onoff
timing
the
default
factory
setting
is
microseconds
on
and
microseconds
off
the
bus
on
timing
needs
to
be
lowered
to
microseconds
this
can
be
done
in
one
of
two
ways
if
you
have
you
can
use
the
n
option
for
example
i
use
a
bus
on
timing
of
microseconds
which
means
that
i
use
the
following
line
in
my
configsys
file
note
that
there
is
no
space
between
the
n
and
the
if
you
dont
have
your
only
recourse
is
to
try
to
find
a
program
called
setscsiexe
which
is
very
difficult
to
find
the
reason
is
that
adaptec
for
reasons
of
their
own
does
not
seem
to
want
this
widely
distributed
i
once
asked
someone
who
worked
for
adaptec
and
they
asked
me
to
not
upload
it
anywhere
if
you
have
anonymous
ftp
access
to
the
internet
you
could
try
using
archie
to
hunt
down
a
copy
i
believe
that
there
are
a
couple
of
sites
that
have
it
if
you
do
find
a
copy
you
run
it
like
so
setscsi
this
adjusts
the
bus
on
timing
to
microseconds
running
setscsiexe
without
any
arguments
resets
the
bus
timing
back
to
the
factory
defaults
note
that
it
seems
that
you
cannot
use
setscsiexe
if
you
use
setscsiexe
crashed
my
system
if
was
loaded
i
could
use
setscsiexe
with
scsihasys
however
do
not
lower
the
bus
on
timing
below
microseconds
or
increase
it
above
microseconds
if
you
lower
it
too
low
the
hard
disk
throughput
will
suddenly
drop
your
system
will
feel
slower
for
me
microseconds
works
fine
this
value
may
work
fine
for
you
or
you
may
have
to
adjust
it
downwards
a
little
once
youve
lowered
the
bus
on
timing
tape
backups
and
restores
should
run
faster
also
do
not
experiment
with
the
bus
onoff
times
with
the
other
options
that
i
have
intentionally
not
described
unless
you
know
what
you
are
doing
bad
combinations
can
cause
parity
errors
and
worse
by
starving
memory
refresh
a
program
called
bustifixexe
exists
on
the
adaptec
bbs
unless
this
has
been
upgraded
since
i
last
checked
which
has
been
a
while
this
is
a
selfextracting
archive
containing
a
batch
file
and
a
couple
of
other
files
this
batch
file
was
supposed
to
allow
one
to
set
the
bus
onoff
times
for
the
and
others
however
when
i
tried
running
this
program
with
my
my
system
crashed
at
the
time
i
was
running
scsihasys
and
i
didnt
check
to
see
if
there
was
a
conflict
with
it
maybe
this
old
program
works
only
with
the
although
the
docs
say
that
it
works
with
the
erratic
tape
operations
or
too
many
tape
errors
this
problem
may
or
may
not
exist
although
it
existed
on
my
system
a
hardware
problem
just
on
my
particular
could
cause
it
however
ive
heard
of
other
people
having
similar
problems
and
so
im
mentioning
this
just
in
case
it
isnt
a
hardware
problem
just
on
my
symptoms
of
this
problem
which
persists
even
after
cleaning
the
tape
head
backing
up
to
tape
encounters
unusable
sector
detected
errors
resulting
in
an
aborted
tape
backup
tape
backup
works
but
the
tape
compare
fails
the
tape
drive
starts
stops
starts
stops
etc
much
too
often
unlike
the
abovementioned
problem
tape
backupsrestores
take
a
long
time
where
the
tape
drive
starts
and
stops
every
few
seconds
this
kind
of
startingstopping
occurs
every
few
seconds
or
so
fastback
plus
does
not
findsee
any
tape
backup
devices
other
programs
like
central
point
backup
and
the
cms
jumbo
software
assuming
that
you
have
a
cms
jumbo
tape
drive
can
findsee
the
tape
drive
but
fastback
plus
cannot
too
many
tape
read
errors
although
i
do
not
know
what
is
causing
this
problem
i
discovered
that
using
a
different
floppy
controller
solves
it
a
few
months
ago
i
upgraded
my
motherboard
which
contained
an
integrated
floppy
controller
as
i
already
had
a
floppy
controller
on
the
i
initially
disabled
the
motherboard
floppy
controller
after
a
while
i
decided
to
try
disabling
the
floppy
controller
and
using
the
one
on
the
motherboard
when
i
did
this
the
tape
drive
a
cms
jumbo
reliability
increased
dramatically
and
fastback
plus
was
suddenly
able
to
find
and
use
the
tape
drive
i
dont
know
if
this
was
caused
by
a
hardware
problem
on
my
on
the
one
hand
the
floppy
drives
worked
great
when
they
were
attached
to
the
which
seems
to
say
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
on
the
other
hand
the
tape
drive
didnt
work
well
attached
to
the
floppy
controller
but
it
did
work
when
attached
to
a
different
controller
this
could
be
an
indication
of
a
hardware
problem
on
my
i
did
change
floppy
drive
cables
and
so
it
is
conceivable
that
the
problem
was
in
the
cables
i
dont
know
what
the
cause
really
is
however
if
youre
having
similar
problems
you
might
want
to
consider
trying
a
new
floppy
controller
sound
cards
many
popular
sound
cards
can
play
or
record
digitized
sound
and
this
is
typically
done
using
dma
like
the
tape
drive
dma
the
adaptecs
dma
can
conflict
with
the
sound
card
dma
unlike
that
of
the
tape
dma
this
conflict
usually
manifests
itself
as
a
parity
error
your
system
crashes
with
a
parity
error
message
what
happens
is
that
data
is
being
transferred
so
quickly
by
the
sound
card
and
the
adaptec
memory
refresh
cannot
occur
quickly
enough
which
causes
a
parity
error
usually
getting
a
parity
error
means
that
there
is
a
hardware
problem
with
your
system
in
this
case
however
the
parity
error
is
not
a
symptom
of
bad
hardware
ive
found
that
such
parity
errors
typically
occur
while
recording
digitized
sound
and
the
chances
of
such
errors
increase
as
you
increase
the
recording
fidelity
eg
higher
sampling
rate
recording
in
stereo
recording
using
instead
of
etc
like
the
tape
drive
solution
the
solution
here
is
to
lower
the
adaptecs
bus
on
timing
see
the
section
on
tape
drives
for
information
on
how
this
is
done
note
however
that
this
may
or
may
not
solve
the
problem
it
may
only
reduce
the
probability
of
a
parity
error
the
software
used
to
record
digitized
sound
can
greatly
affect
this
problem
ie
some
software
is
inefficient
disk
caches
the
speed
of
your
hard
disk
and
the
amount
of
disk
fragmentation
can
also
affect
this
miscellaneous
info
this
section
contains
miscellaneous
hints
tips
and
rumors
much
of
it
is
merely
information
that
ive
heard
or
read
about
and
have
not
verified
i
believe
that
the
following
information
is
correct
but
im
not
sure
use
it
at
your
own
risk
with
qemm
and
you
need
to
specify
the
db
parameter
eg
unless
you
are
using
the
driver
if
you
dont
qemm
will
crashhang
at
bootup
although
the
qemm
manual
mentions
this
the

does
not
seem
to
detect
that
a

present
and
automatically
add
this

to
the
qemm
command
line
at
least
this
occurred
with
the
qemm
install
program
i
havent
tested
any
other
version
earlier
versions
of
qemm
probably
need
this
parameter
but
im
not
sure
ive
never
used
a
version
earlier
than
if
you
use
you
do
not
need
to
give
qemm
the

some

all
versions
of

not
support
hard

to
support
hard

over
you
need
to
get
a
new
rom
bios
from
adaptec
im
not
sure
if
this
is
still
true
of
the
latest
being
sold
by
adaptec
to
connect
a
cdrom
drive
to
the
you
need
a
scsi
cdrom
drive
and
some
drivers
note
that
some
cdrom
drives
have
proprietary
interfaces
nonscsi
these
drives
cannot
be
used
with
the
you
have
three
choices
for
cdrom
drivers
i
have
no
idea
how
well
the
following
solutions
work
or
even
if
they
work
the
following
is
secondhand
information
you
can
buy
adaptecs
ez
scsi
driver
package
which
lists
for
something
like
if
you
already
have
older
adaptec
drivers
you
can
supposedly
upgrade
to
ez
scsi
for
around
contact
adaptec
for
details
the
ez
scsi
package
supposedly
contains
everything
that
you
need
you
can
buy
the
corelscsi
driver
package
which
is
made
by
the
same
people
that
make
coreldraw
this
package
contains
cdrom
drivers
scsi
tape
drivers
worm
drivers
etc
i
do
not
know
the
list
price
but
ive
seen
this
package
sold
for
around
note
that
corelscsi
does
not
come
with
the
driver
which
is
needed
if
you
do
not
already
have
you
may
be
better
off
getting
adaptecs
ez
scsi
instead
this
method
is
obsolete
as
the
following
drivers
have
been
obsoleted
by
adaptecs
ez
scsi
kit
but
im
mentioning
it
in
case
someone
already
has
these
drivers
you
can
use
the
drivers
in
the
adaptec
kit
and
the
kit
aspi
cdrom
drivers
you
will
have
to
get
a
copy
of
mscdexexe
a
highlevel
cdrom
driver
if
it
is
not
included
in
the
kit
but
this
is
available
from
several
bulletin
boards
to
use
a
scsi
tape
drive
with
the
you
need
software
that
knows
how
to
talk
to
a
scsi
tape
drive
software
that
ive
heard
about
are
again
like
the
above
section
on
cdrom
drives
i
have
no
idea
how
well
the
following
solutions
work
or
even
if
they
work
the
following
is
secondhand
information
central
point
pc
tools
for
msdos
supposedly
supports
a
large
number
of
scsi
tape
drives
it
comes
with
scsi
drivers
as
well
as
central
point
backup
the
corelscsi
driver
package
contains
a
scsi
tape
backup
program
see
the
above
section
on
cdrom
drives
for
more
details
however
note
that
corelscsi
does
not
come
with
but
requires
ive
seen
advertisements
that
sell
the
in
three
configurations
scsi
controller
with
hard

rom

scsi

wbios
and
adaptec
aspi
drivers
scsi

wbios
adaptec

and
corelscsi

i
imagine
that
adaptec
now
sells
the
in
a
fourth
configuration
scsi
controller
wbios
and
ez
scsi

including
aspi

those
people
who
use
unix
might
be
interested
in
a
version
of
gnu
tar
for
msdos
that
talks
to
a
scsi
tape
drive
via
the

you
need
this
driver
before
you
can
use
this
program
ive
never
used
this
version
of
gnu
tar
but
ive
heard
that
it
works
i
dont
know
how
well
though
if
you
have
anonymous

im
very

with

certainly
a

say

nicer

thats
well
out

conclusion
if
youre
on

get
one
and
be
prepared
to
send
it
back
if
its
not
perfect
it
probably
wont

something

bear
in

is
what
the

the
origional
intention
of
the

was
to
speed
up

that

be
faster
this
is
espically
useful
in

not

the

contained

arrived

it

its
not
dramatic
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
especially
noticable
when

the
fact
that
it
is
worse

what
im

if

perfect
i
dont

does
the

consider
this

normal

ship
their

this

provides

fast
scsi
can
be
wide
or
fast
it
depends
on
how
the

designedthe

will
support
fast
scsi
but
not
wide
when
the
os
scsi
manager
is
rewritten
since
the
quardas
use
a
nonwide

the
article
in

was
talking
about

native

outside
its

it
behaves
a
lot
like
devices
slower
through
put
from
your
own
figures
is
indeed
twice
esdi
as
the
article
pointed
out
as
for
faster
then
ide
that
seems
to
be
using
a
contoler
chip
the
mac
quadra
uses
a
controler
chip
for
its
and
gets
through
put
for
asynchronous
far
in
excess
of
a
normal
synchronous
output
of
is
which
is
near
the
burst
of
a
machine
with
a
controller
chip
the
pc
world
seems
to
have
and
mixed
up
fact
is
controler
chips
allow
near
speeds
through
a
device
as
shown
in
the
mac
quadra
which
skews
some
of
the
data
of
vs
ide
or
esdi
test
i
agree
that
the
article
could
have
stated
that
the
faster
then
ide
came
off
a
device
with
a
chip
maybe
it
was
there
and
the
editor
killed
it
because
the
article
was
dealing
with
not
and
he
did
not
understand
the
effect
of
a
device
with
a
controller
chip
chips
are
limited
to
max
devices
with
chips
becoming
common
produce
up
to
in
mode
and
in
mode
the
fast
version
ports
cannot
use
wide
scsi
of
cource
the
prime
piece
of
wierdness
is
that
devices
have
chips
or
more
accurately
the
machine
does
this
allows
the
best
of
both
worlds
high
speeds
and
cheeper
costs
full
hardware
port
electronic
controller
etc
is
very
expensive
it
also
creates
a
logistic
nightmare
as
to
how
fast
goes
when
one
knows
the
facts
behind
the
numbers
then
one
realizes
that
the
article
knows
what
it
is
talking
about
even
if
it
does
not
tell
how
the
figures
came
about
while
is
throwing
out

an

said
it

not

it

is
maximum

quadra
uses

it

what

really
noticable
im

will
the

be
noticed
for
these
if
you
are
talking
about
laser
jet
then
i
believe
it
has
to
be
postscript
i
dont
see
any
advantage
to
using
pcl
when
you
have
a
peice
of
hardware
plugged
into
the
that
is
doing
the
work
and
it
can
support
any
language
that
is
suited
for
the
job
besides
i
dont
think
pcl
is
even
capable
of
handling
dpi
specifications
i
only
have
experience
with
the
laser
master
winjet
which
brings
the
up
to
dpi
and
it
uses
postscript
it
also
has
a
fast
print
mode
which
is
not
postscript
and
it
is
at
a
lower
resolution
i
think
but
it
is
fast
this
particular
product
uses
your
host
processor
to
process
the
postscript
so
even
with
a
decent
pc
you
know
its
going
to
be
slow
ie
slow
compared
to
a
highend
workstation
processed
ps
the
quality
difference
is
very
noticable
and
is
almost
worth
the
wait
for
the
ps
processing
im
rather
impatient
we
were
using
it
for
bw
camera
images
the
gray
scale
image
was
accepted
by
ms
word
and
handed
to
the
winjet
ps
printer
driver
which
converts
the
image
into
postscript
and
then
hands
it
off
to
the
winjets
postscript
processor
the
postscript
is
rendered
into
ram
lots
of
it
and
when
it
is
done
it
shoots
it
directly
to
the
printer
the
ps
processor
can
also
accept
ps
files
created
from
other
sources
including
dos
applications
but
windows
has
to
be
running
at
the
time
of
printing
the
ps
processor
is
responsible
for
the
halftoning
and
id
say
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
our

came
out
very
good
in

not

orchid
vs
fahrenheit
mini
review
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
and
and
orchid
in
short
i
am
happy
with
the
monitor
and
unhappy
with
the
card
i
have
spent
a
lot
more
time
futzing
with
the
card
so
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
write
about
the
monitor
is
pretty
the
moires
i
had
under
simcity
on
my
magnavox
went
away
it
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
lbs
i
think
so
much
for
the
monitor
on
to
the
bitch
session
and
test
results
in
going
with
the
modern
trend
the
orchid
card
only
supports
colors
in
mode
without
a
driver
of
course
this
breaks
any
dos
program
which
uses
svga
modes
like
most
of
my
cdroms
the
compudyne
whiplash
vga
orchid
fahrenheit
and
orchid
f
vlb
all
share
this
limitation
those
are
all
cards
which
means
it
is
an
problem
for
them
the
uses
a
weitek
vga
chip
which
also
doesnt
support
them
the
hercules
graphite
card
does
seem
to
have
these
modes
but
i
didnt
run
the
same
test
cases
as
i
did
on
the
other
boards
during
the
brief
time
i
had
it
it
was
able
to
print
the
splash
screen
for
the
groliers
encyclopedia
though
which
the
cards
just
printed
as
hash
which
is
why
i
suspect
the
svga
modes
are
supported
the
supported
resolutions
really
annoy
me
you
can
do
at
if
you
tell
the
driver
you
have
an
nec
they
only
have
about
six
monitors
listed
plus
generic
and
if
you
choose
generic
you
cant
get
any
high
refreshes
at
all
but
at
you
are
limited
to
seems
to
me
that
the
hardware
should
be
able
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
at
it
sure
should
be
able
to
do
it
at
higher
vertical
resolution
was
the
main
reason
i
bought
the
card
over
the
orchid
f
vlb
i
currently
have
and
it
will
do
hz
as
well
the
higher
graphics
modes
all
crash
hp
dashboard
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
orchid
and
with
the
drivers
i
dont
know
what
i
have
he
was
unable
to
recreate
the
problem
on
the
plus
side
their
tech
rep
was
as
helpful
as
he
could
be
and
booted
up
the
program
on
his
computer
to
verify
he
didnt
have
the
problem
he
didnt
know
why
they
limited
the
refresh
to
hz
either
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
things
according
to
the
hercules
speedy
program
this
program
tests
various
operations
and
reports
the
results
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
the
graphite
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
was
running
in
a
isa
so
the
numbers
arent
really
comparable
the
following
numbers
were
all
obtained
using
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memory
i
give
ranges
because
the
program
reports
the
numbers
as
it
computes
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
k
means
thousand
not
m
means

the

my

is
after

been

that
can
just
be

awesome
interestingly
the

show
no

and
hatched
polygons
ie
filled
with
crosshatching
and

whatever
they
are
graphics
operations
like
xors
maybe
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
give
two

for

because
i
think
they
are
caching
when
the
fonts
are
first
drawn
on

they
are
done
fairly
slowly
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increases
dramatically
sounds
like
programming
to
a
benchmark
to
me
i
make
no
claims
that
these
numbers
mean
anything
at

its
just

im
using
to
read
my
joystick
and
it
is
hideously
slow
something
like
of
my
cpu
time
is
being
spent
reading
the
joystick
and
this
is
in
a
program
that
does
nothing
but
printf
and
joyread
the
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
programs
trap
like
smartdrv
and
so
it
is
a
slow
as
hell
interface
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reasonably
safe
fashion
via
polling
and
that
isnt
platform
or
clockspeed
specific
the
joystick
reads
in
anolog
values
through
a
digital
port
how
you
send
a
command
to
the
port
to
read
it
then
you
time
how
long
it
takes
for
the
joystick
port
to
set
a
certain
bit
this
time
is
proportional
to
the
joystick
position
obviously
since
time
is
used
as
a
position
you
cannot
get
rid
of
this
ridiculus
waste
of
time
if
you
wrote
your
own
routine
instead
of
the
bios
it
would
speed
it
up
some
but
the

would
still
be

adaptec

about

i
purchased

for

at
the
time
this
seemed
the
thing
to
do
as
the
documentation
i
had
with

adaptec
scsi

said
that
this
is
the
driver
to
be
used
with
cdrom
drives
since
then
i
have
learn
that
this
driver
is
out
of
date
in
a
major
way
and
that
adaptec
have
an
upgrade
deal
for
going
to
the
next
driver
i
think
its
called
eziscsi
or
something
i
wasnt
too
fussed
about
this
until
i
upgraded
by
cdrom
drive
from
a
sony
to
a
sony
i
now
find
that
the
audiomode
will
not
work
i
assume
it
is
not
being
handled
correctly
by
the
driver
so
should
i
chase
adaptec
for
an
upgrade
if
so
does
anyone

help
installing

recently
my

got
a
second
internal
ide
drive
a
seagate
i
can
look
up
the
model
number
if
its
important
and
ive
been
trying
to
help
him
install
it
ive
got
a
vested
interest
since
my
machines
busted
and
i
have
to
use
his
until
i
get
mine
fixed
he
already
has
a
seagate
ide
hd
again
i
forget
the
model
number
but
i
can
find
out
anyway
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
bloody
thing
up
ive
managed
to
get
one
or
the
other
drive
up
with
the
other
disconnected
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
whenever
i
try
the
thing
hangs
during
bootup
never
gets
past
the
system
test
the
ide
controllers
instruction
sheet
says
it
supports
two
drives
i
think
ive
configured
the
cmos
correctly
the
powers
plugged
in
properly
i
even
learned
about
the
masterslave
relationship
that
two
hds
are
supposed
to
have
didnt
know
pcs
were
into
sm
and
i
think
i
configured
the
jumpers
properly
the
one
is
the
master
the
new
one
is
the
slave
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
maybe
im
doing
the
cabling
wrong
ive
tried
several
combinations
controller
master
slave
controller
slave
master
master
controller
slave
none
of
them
worked
unfortunately
i
cant
think
of
any
others
another
possibility
is
that
the
one
is
already
partitioned
into
two
seperate
drives
c
and
d
and
the
cmos
asks
for
c
drive
and
d
drive
setup
info
rather
than
drive
and
drive
like
most
others
ive
seen
could
this
be
confusing
things
so
i
need
help
the
drive
came
bereft
of
any
docs
except
for
some
info
for
the
cmos
setup
the
controller
has
a
little
piece
of
paper
about
the
size
of
an
index
card
i
cannibalized
the
cable
its
one
of
those
with
a
connector
at
each
end
and
the
one
in

middle
so
it
looks

it

i
agree
theres
a

does
anyone

this
is
it
a

it
will
give

just

probably
bought
a
too
also
all
this
armwaving
about
scsi
expandability
is
a
moot
point
if
the
user
only
has
one
or
two
drives
on
it
and
with
scsi
those
two
drives
may
be
fast
but
that
speed
is
only
due
to
the
onboard
memory
cache
something
i
can
duplicate
with
a
caching
ide
controller
what
the
fastwide
spec
has
much
more
bandwidth
than
any
stupid
vlbus
ide
crap
stop
this
thread
now
its
just
cluttering
up
bandwidth
if
you
want
to
read
about
scsi
vs
ide
just
pay
a
visit
to
you
local
usenet
archive
the
best
fastwideetc
is
clearly
faster
than
any
the

ide
drive
all
the
response
given
are
based
upon
personal
experience
with
or
drives
you
cant
judge
such
completely
different
interfaces
ide
has
the
low
cost
adavantage
a
descent
performance
scsi
has
the
ability
for
super
high

expandibility
and

neither

is

in

was

that
the

in

can

access

also
that
some

on

look

to

that

my

had

only

anyone

somewhat
frustrating
i
got
it
to
work
somehow
but
my
turbo
switch
doesnt
work
at
all
i
just
put
replaced
the
motherboard
in
a
system
and
had
similar
questions
my
cents
worth
the
speaker
connector
should
have
two
wires
going
to
the
speaker
a
speaker
being
a
coil
its
bidirectional
and
makes
no
difference
which
way
you
attach
turbo
switch
there
are
three
wires
to
control
how
you
want
turbo
to
become
active
with
the
switch
pushed
in
or
the
switch
out
i
think
the
middle
wire
is
common
use
an
ohm
meter
to
figure
out
which
wire
connects
with
the
common
wire
when
the
switch
is
pushed
in
and
which
two
wires
are
connected
when
the
switch
is
out
place
the
appropriate
two
wires
on
the
turbo
berg
connector
of
the
motherboard
leds
turbo
and
hd
leds
are
uni
directional
depending
which
way
the
wires
are
attached
the
led
will
not
light
on
my
ami
motherboard
if
the
turbo
switch
wires
are
not
attached
to
the
berg
connector
on
the
board
the
board
will
power
up
in
default
in
turbo
mode
if
your
motherboard
is
like
that
just
attace
the
led
wires
to
the
board
if
the
led
doesnt
light
power
off
reverse
the
connectors
and
try
again
it
should
work
if
it
does
then
attach
the

to

hope

only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
said
isa
was
necessary
eisa
or
vlb
are
the
only
interfaces
worth
investing
thousands
of
dollars
eg
a
new
pcs
worth
of
money
in
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
you
didnt
read
to
carefully
vlbide
uses
the
same
connection
mechanism
as
standard
ide
if
transfer
rate
is
limited
by
ide
whether
its
interfaced
to
isa
eisa
or
vlb
matters
not
so
at
its
lowest
setting
interface
in
asynchronous
mode
averages
the
through
put
maximum
of
ide
in
asynchronous
mode
in
full
mode
it
blows
poor
ide
out
the
window
down
the
street
and
into
the
garbage
can
as
implimented
on
what
system
on
mine
for
one
thing
scsi
blows
ide
out
of
the
water
hands
down
if
ide
has
better
throughput
why
isnt
it
used
on
workstations
and
file
servers
the
problem
becomes
can
the
drive
mechanisim
keep
up
with
those
through
put
rates
and
that
is
where
the
bottleneck
and
cost
of
comes
from
not
the
interface
itself
but
more
and
more
from
drive
mechanisims
to
use
the
through
put
given
the
original
question
scsi
used
only
as
a
single
hard
drive
controller
is
it
then
necessary
to
get
a
scsi
drive
that
will
do
at
least
maybe
megssec
for
the
scsi
choice
to
make
any
sence
what
does
a
meg
megssec
scsi

cost
no
thats
the
nice
thing
on
a
multitasking
os
scsi
can
use
both
drives
at
once
ive
got
unix
loaded
on
one
of
my

along
with
windogs
and
the
os
can
only
use
one
of
the

ide

at

its

ugly
i
just
bought

my

i
paid

i
havent

cheaper
the
original
cga
cart
back
in
was
i
think
the
original
ega
card
or
pga
was
scsi
has
stood
relatively
alone
in
not
coming
down
in
price
mainly
because
were
talking
about
pcs
and
not
suns
or
sparc
or
sgi
or
name
your
favorite
unix
workstation
that
is
after
millions
of
pc
buying
decisions
over
the
years
scsi
has
had
plenty
of
time
to
come
down
in
price
no
actually
were
talking
about
scsi
being
expensive
simply
because
nobody
did
a

if

then
youd
find
scsi
the

i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa

when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
single
drive
scsi
is
more
expensive
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expandibility
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drives
or
whatever
the
following
are
why
i
find
scsi
intrinsically
better
than
ide
a
partial
list
you
can
add
many
different
types
of
devices
and
access
them
concurrently
a
scsi
device
works
on
many
different
machines
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
moving
hard
drives
between
them
is
very
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
scsi
devices
work
together
better
than
ide
devices
for
instance
recently
i
added
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
as
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termination
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goes
i
have
a
problem
with
ides
mutual
exclusion
i
notice
that
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
accessing
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quite
long
as
compared
to
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitasking
os
this
is
very
noticable
as
many
things
can
be
going
on
at
once
one
neat
thing
that
ive
noticed
lately
a
fringe
benefit
has
been
the
ability
to
add
older
almost
dead
drives
as
storage
on
a
scsi
system
with
little
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg

that
ive
added

ive
now

it

allow

to
have

im

my

works
finei
just
talk

everything
comes
out
clear
this
other

at
the

is
a
turbomodem
from
the
complete
pc
the
machines
are
in

so
a
direct

is
impossible
and
copying
this
much

is
a
paineasier
to
turn
the

on
for
a
few

go

it

just

thats

your

that
most

more

how

theres
a

oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
on
a
single
drive
scsi
is
more
expensive
but
on
that
point
is
it
faster
this
is
what
all
this
is
about
do
you
get
more
performance
for
the
money
for
all
the
people
that
will
only
have
a
single
hard
drive
in
their
system
regardless
of
the
os
will
the
scsi
choice
really
give
them
more
performance
than
ide
but
you
bought
your
pc
for
expandibility
so
youd
want
to
add
more
drives
or
whatever
true
but
expandibility
can
also
start
on
the
bus
which
means
the
option
is
there
for
cdrom
drives
or
tape
backups
that
run
off
their
own
cards
you
can
add
many
different
types
of
devices
and
access
them
concurrently
no
argument
this
is
always
held
up
to
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
as
the
best
reason
but
how
many
scsi
devices
will
the
first
time
scsi
buyer
eventually
acquire
again
does
it
make
sense
to
go
scsi
for
a
single
hard
drive
system
a
scsi
device
works
on
many
different
machines
i
have
a
mac
and
a
pc
at
home
and
moving
hard
drives
between
them
is
very
nice
with
scsi
hook
them
up
and
away
they
go
with
all
the
postings
on
the
scsi
i
or
ii
specs
are
you
really
sure
that
pc
and
apple
scsi
hard
drives
are
compatible
and
even
if
they
are
is
the
data
accessible
from
either
machine
ie
are
there
no
formatting
partitioning
or
file
table
differences
is
it
really
plugnplay
scsi
devices
work
together
better
than
ide
devices
for
instance
recently
i
added
an
older
connor
meg
ide
to
a
maxtor
meg
ide
the
connor
must
be
setup
as
the
slave
it
will
work
no
other
way
on
scsi
you
set
the
address
check
the
termination
plug
it
in
and
away
it
goes
so
the
c
drive
on
the
connor
becomes
a
logical
d
drive
to
dos
is
this
really
a
problem
i
have
a
problem
with
ides
mutual
exclusion
i
notice
that
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
accessing
drive
c
to
drive
d
is
quite
long
as
compared
to
the
time
it
takes
to
switch
from
drive
c
to
d
on
a
scsi
system
under
a
multitasking
os
this
is
very
noticable
as
many
things
can
be
going
on
at
once
after
having
two
ide
drives
in
my
system
for
temporary
file
transfers
i
have
never
seen
any
differences
when
switching
between
drives
nor
have
i
ever
seen
any
differences
when
transfering
files
between
drives
or
tofrom
the
same
drive
one
neat
thing
that
ive
noticed
lately
a
fringe
benefit
has
been
the
ability
to
add
older
almost
dead
drives
as
storage
on
a
scsi
system
with
little
problem
weve
got
a
bunch
of
almost
dead
meg
drives
that
ive
added
to
my
pc
ive
now
got
the
interface
full
but
it
does
allow
me
to
have
meg
drives
meg
drive
tape
drive
and
meg
drive
all
on
the
same
card
that
is
nice
as
long
as
the
power
supply
can
keep
up
i
do
believe
that
there
is
the
possibility
for

handier

not

even

is
acceptable
i

they

useful

the

looking
at
if
anyone
is
familiar
with
them
the
system
that
looks
the
most
interesting
is
the
budget
vlb
tower
for
about
delivered
it
offers
vlb
ide
a
mitsumi
cdrom
with
software
bundle
media
vision
sound
board
ctx
cache
and
the
usual
drives
ports
os
software
since
my
budget
is
for
a
system
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
which
may
mean
it
is
too
good
to
be
true
of
course
among
other
things
ive
never
seen
a
review
of
the
budget
systems
or
their
parent
company
micro
smart
or
of
the
motherboard
they
are
using
the
aetana
any
feedback
would
be
appreciated
in
a
similar
vein
the
second
system
im
considering
midwest
micros
elite
vesa
tower
with
a
diamond
viper
midwest
micro
mi
monitor
is
one
ive
never
seen
reviewed
anywhere
im
familiar
with
the
firm
but
not
the
product
line
and
some
idea
of
their
quality
would
be
abig
benefit
here
as
well
any
other
suggestions
in
the
price
range
would
be
appreciated
my
greatest
needs
are
speed
and
graphics
capabilities
email
response
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
the
only
purpose
for
which
power
can
be
rightfully
exercised
over
any
member
of
a
civilized
community
against
his

is
to
prevent
harm
to

his

this

on

you
add

ibm
nicely
copies

so
rem

once
more

reboot
if
you
have

it
will
work
things
are
pretty
smooth
through
the
rest
of

will
try
to

once

at

so
you
are
off
to

more

the

comes
with

and
costs
the
same
as
the
adaptec

that
do
not
come
with

the
dos
drivers
work
great
this
card
can
easily
be
configured
to
work
with
different
sets
of
io
ports
and
you
can
use
multiple
host
adapters
in

if
you
get
a

it

im

hideously

something

of

the

and
this
is
in

does
nothing

there
is
no

for

not

take
of

even
if
it

the
problem
is
that
a

trap

so
it
is
a
slow

interface
can
i
read
the
joystick
port
in
a
reasonably
safe
fashion
via

and
that
isnt
platform

clockspeed
specific
the
truth
is
that
int
joystick
reading
is
slow
i
read
it
directly
from
the
hardware
port
note
that
doing
so
exposes
you
to
intermittent
disturbance

interrupts
so
you
may
want
to
read
say
twice
in

keep
the

dont
just
turn

off
it
may
prove
detrimental

we

plague
us
for
months
on
our

i
finally
got
tired
of
it
so
i
permanently
interchanged
the
drives
the
only
reason
i
didnt
do
it
in
the
first
place
was
because
i
had
several
bootable
and
some
based
install
disks
which
expected
the
a

i
order
all
new
software
and
upgrades
to
be
and
the
number
of
stupid
install
programs
that
cant
handle
an
alternate
drive
are
declining
with
time
the
ones
i
had
are
now
upgraded
and
as
for
the
bootable
i
just
cut
replacements

switching
the
drives
is
not
an
option
you
might
be
able
to
wire
up
a
drive
switch
to
your
computer
chasis
i
havent
tried
it
but
i
think
it
would
work
as
long
as
it
is
wired
carefully
i
did
this
i
use
a

instead
of
a
huge

this
way
if
the
relay
breaks
my

will
still
work
it
works
fine

you
may
still

serves

the

any

eg

first
and

it
will
try
to
install
as
the
next
drive
but
if
there
are
already
two

then
no

do
the
solution
is
simple
use

disable

inserted
pullup

on

the

doesnt
complain
about

the

stays

there
is
a
way
in
which
a
multitasking
computer
actually
gives
you
more
cpu
power
then
you
had
before
and
that
is
with
io
overlap
with
io
overlap
your
cpu
can
continue
to
think
while
disk
operations
are
underway
whereas
without
overlap
your
cpu
sits
idly
waiting
for
each
disk
operation
to
finish
and
disk
operations
take
an
eternity
compared
to
a
fast
cpu
so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma

why

data
is
data
and
it
could
be
anywhere
on

can
scsi
find

faster
can
it
get
it
off
the
drive

into
the
computer
faster
does
it
have
a
better
cache
system
i
thought
scsi
was
good
at
managing
a
data
bus
when
multiple
devices
are
attached
if
we
are
only
talking
about
a
single
drive
explain
why
scsi
is
inherently
faster
at
managing
data
from
a
hard
drive
the
adaptec
use
bus
mastering
this
means
that
the
cpu
doesnt
sit
waiting
for
data
bytes
it
can
go
off
and
do
other
computing
if
you
have
an
advanced
multitasking
os
that
is
dos
just
sits
and
waits
anyway
ide
integrated
device
electronics
currently
the
most
common
standard
and
is
mainly
used
for
medium
sized
drives
can
have
more
than
one
hard
drive
asynchronous
transfer
max
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
you
can
quote
scsi
specs
till
youre
blue
in
the
face
but
if
they
exceed
the
isa
bus
capability
then
whats
the
point
who
says
ide
is
limited
to
megssec
what
about
vlbide
does
anyone
know
how
they
perform
why
dont
you
start
with
the
specsheet
of
the
isa
bus
first
ide
was
designed
to
plug
into
isa
virtually
unaided
in
essence
ide
is
isa
on
a
ribbon
cable
therefore
its
specs
are
the
same
as
isa
clock
bit
width
this
is
why
ive
concluded
that
ide
on
vlbus
is
a
waste
of
a
fast
slot
the
cards
job
would
to
slow
the
vlbus
transactions
to

heck
thats
what

do

to

oss
when
managing
data
from
a

scsi
hard

a
scsi
controller
that
transfers

by
dma
allows
the

request

and
continue
working
while
the

gets
the

moves

ide
also
uses
dma
techniques
i
believe
floppy
controller
also
uses
dma
and
most
ad

also
use
dma
dma
is
no
big
deal
and
has
nothing
to
do
directly
with
scsi
ide
does
not
do
dma
this
is
because
its
like
te
pc
at
hard

interface
the
controller
moves
a
sector
to
some
buffer
memory
on
the
controller
card
then
the
cpu
moves
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
main
memory
where
its
needed
if
ide
doesnt
work
this
way
then
its
not

heck
if
ide
used
dma
then
youd
hear
all
kinds
of
complaints
about
isa
bus
systems
with
more
than
ram
not
working
with
their
ide
drives
is
the
dma
addressing
limit
of
the
isa

and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
trouble
btw
there
are
dmaenabling

in
the
ide
cable
spec
but
the
last
report
i
heard
was
that
they

ive
been
intently
following
the
mag
thread
while
waiting
for
mine
to
arrive
in
the
mail
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
complaints
about
minor
alignment
problems
with
the
one
article
contained
a
comment
that
the
owner
called
the
factory
and
was
told
that
his
screen
rotation
was
within
spec
that
figure
for
image
rotation
would
seem
to
be
a
little
high
on
my
nec
the
specs
call
for
no
greater
than
well
my
monitor
arrived
last
night
and
sure
enough
it
has
a
very
noticable
barrel
distortion
its
not
dramatic
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
especially
noticable
when
the
image
doesnt
fill
the
entire
screen
the
fact
that
it
is
worse
on
the
right
side
doesnt
help
matters
what
im
trying
to
find
out
is
if
these
minor
imperfections
are
the
norm
or
are
most
of
their
monitors
perfect
i
dont
want
to
send
it
back
and
get
one
with
the
same
or
an
even
worse
problem
does
the
factory
consider
this
kind
of
thing
normal
and
ship
their
monitors
with
less
than
perfect
alignment
i
cant
speak
for
mag
innovision
but
as
far
as
nec
is
concerned
they
are
adjusted
to
factoryspec
before
leaving
the
central
usa
distribution
point
ma
for
the
eastern
canadian
market
now
heres
the
key
nec
knows
that
the
monitors
adjustments
are
very
sensitive
to
shipping
over
distances
with
all
the
bumps
rough
handling
and
such
and
therefore
expect
and
at
least
in
theory
require
that
the
local
distributor
not
dealer
have
it
adjusted
at
the
local
service
centre
bull
hn
information
systems
in
toronto
before
sale
this
is
the
correct
and
probably
only
way
of
having
any
chance
of
receiving
a
perfect
monitor
the
definition
of
perfect
seems
to
depend
on
how
picky
one
is
in
my
case
quite
are
other
netters
just
living
with
these
kind
of
imperfections
i
for
one
was
not
willing
to
accept
what
i
considered
a
substandard
monitor
and
after
two
months
of
wrangling
and
direct
contact
with
nec
finally
received
a
satisfactorily
adjusted
monitor
not
perfect
imho
but
a
major
improvement
over
what
the
dealer
and
distributor
were
trying
convince
me
was
normal
the
short
answer
is
no
dont
accept
these
imperfections
as
normal
because
for
the
premium
one
pays
for
the
larger
screen
monitors
one
has
a
right
to
expect
higher
quality
and
if
youre
persistent
youll
receive
it
comments

opinions
are

the

from
scsi
is
not
complex
it
is
just
the
way
the
industry
uses
and
talks
about
it
there
are
three
key
differences
in
scsi
the
controller
chip
the
port
and
the
software
that
is
it
let
us
look
as
scsi
in
from
this
stand
point
asynchronous
and
synchronous
modes
software
scsi
driver
only
asynchronous
is
slower
then
synchronous
mode
only
vs
synchronous
speeds
can
be
reached
by
most
divices
with
a
rewrite
of
the
software
driver
as
is
the
case
for
the
mac
quadra
this
is
the
main
source
for
the
confusion
this
differs
from
only
in
the
controler
chip
in
most
machines
in
the
mac
and
some
pcs
this
is
called
fast
because
it
uses
ports
and
software
drivers
and
can
produce
speeds
through
inspite
of
this
even
in
the
slower
asynchronous
mode
average
speed
in
asynchronous
mode
with
in
both
quadras
and
higher
end
pcs
synchronous
mode
just
allows
a
higher
burst
rate
two
versionswidefast
wide
requires
two
things
over
a
software
driver
and
a
wide
scsi
port
on
the
machine
and
the
external
device
fast
also
requires
two
things
over
driver
software
and
that
the
recieving
devise
support
fast
speed
of
both
is
the
same
with
burst
also
know
as
wide
and
fast
scsi
over
this
requires
driver
software
wide
port
and
that
the
recieving
devices
also
have
a
mode
chip
as
expected
this
is
very
expencive
speed
with
bursts
as
i
said
simple
seven
versions
of
scsi
seperated
by
software
the
controler
chip
and
the
port
standarize
the
software
and
it
drops
to
only
five
versions
of
scsi
seperate
by
only
hardware
the
chip
and
the
port

you

out

will
the

bob
well
it
all
depends
on
the
motherboard
implimentation
im
sure
someone
will
make
a
vlb
motherboard
that
takes
simms
and
uses
a
pentium
processor
im
also
sure
that
there
will
be
some
motherboards
that
wont
subject
beyond
trident
and
lots
more
hi
i
have
a
few
enquiries
about
pcs
and
compatibles
in
general
some
software
others
hardware
orientated
probably
the
wrong
newsgroup
as
everyone
claims
anyway
does
any
one
happen
to
have
the
board
jumper
details
for
a
trident
svga
graphics
card
or
even
what
the
dip
switches
do
on
the
end
mine
already
works
fine
albeit
slow
and
after
having
blown
up
a
monitor
i
found
out
which
switch
controlled
the
interlacenon
interlace
facility
but
im
curious
as
to
why
there
are
dip
switches
on
the
card
with
apparantly
little
use
secondly
does
anyone
know
why
commodore
had
to
be
so
crazed
in
their
design
of
the
motherboard
with
respect
to
the
ram
ie
or
can
anyone
supply
pin
details
for
the
expansion
ports
for
a
pc
or
bit
or
even
a
sample
circuit
to
cause
an
irq
when
a
button
is
pressed
yeah
i
know
its
a
piece
of
cake
im
lazy
software
wise
anyone
care
to
divulge
some
tips
on
accessing
expanded
ram
on
a
pc
from
a
program
written
in
turbo
c
for
instance
using
farcoreleft
and
coreleft
return
only
memory
available
from
the
base
regardless
of
combinations
of
etc
etc
what
i
want
is
to
be
able
to
use
the
ram
above
and
beyond
the
boundary
im
not
certain
whether
farmalloc
new
actually
uses
it
anyway
but
ill
suspect
not
also
what
half
brained
wit
created
dos
so
as
not
to
be
reentrant
as
a
follow
on
does
anyone
have
any
comments
about
the
use
of
dos
calls
to

help
on
hand
scanners
wanted
fellow
netters
im
in
the
market
for
a
hand
scanner
however
i
dont
know
anyone
who
has
one
i
have
my
eye
on
two
choices
dexxa
this
scanner
is
available
at
walmart
for
it
includes
grayworks
software
and
provides
dpi
and
grayscales
i
think
the
ocr
software
catchword
is
available
through
mailorder
for
about
also
mustek
gray
artist
for
windows
this
scanner
offers
grayscales
according
to
cad
graphics
and
dpi
it
is
available
for
mailorder
and
comes
with
perceive
ocr
and
picture
publisher
le
i
am
also
looking
at
a
genius
hand
scanner
from
cad
graphics
it
is
basically
the
same
as
the
mustek
scanner
except
for
the
resolution
dpi
and
price
basically
i
would
like
recommendations
on
which
to
buy
i
have
heard
that
logitech
makes
the
best
and
manufactures
dexxa
scanners
but
which
one
is
the
best
buy
would
dpi
really
be
helpful
output
would
be
no
better
than
hp
laserjet
iii
or
canon
to
i
am
leaning
toward
the
mustek
because
it
offers
the
most
features
and
is
in
the
middle
in
terms
of
prices
which
should
i
buy
if
you
have
a
hand
scanner
please
let
me
know
whether
or
not
you
would
recommend
it
also
if
you
know
of
another
scanner
within
the
price
range
under
that
would
be
a
better
deal
please
email
me
any
and
all
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated

no

they

last
year
the
difference
between
my

is
due

to
a
difference
in

criteria

the
scoring
i
used
different
tests
than
they
did

i
scored
differently
theres
nothing

very

it
was
a

points
shy

one
of
the
things
everyone
should
do
when

is
to

the
criteria
and
methodology
carefully
unless
you

how
the
product
testing
was
done
and
on
what
the

are
based
you
cant
possibly
know
what
they
really
mean
just
seeing
that
i
rank
a

differently
from
windows
sources
is
meaningless
without
knowing
how
we
did
the

likewise
its

to

a

the

so
youll

from

however
i
can
tell
you
to
stay
clear
of
any
board
which
uses
the
rockwell
mpu
as
opposed
to
the
dpu
for
an
internal
implementation
this
is
because
the
mpu
used
speed
buffering
instead
of
having
a
interface
without
the
interface
the
number
of
interrupts
are
still
the
same
and
thus
may
get
dropped
under

ide
however
is
defined

the
standard
at
interface
created

the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual
page
the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the
io
bus
and
uses
the
system
board
direct
memory
access
dma
for
record
data
transfers
i
expect
to
see
something
similar
for
the
pcat
hdd
adapter
so
the
lowly
lowdensity
original
pc
fdd
card
used
dma
and
the

doesnt
that
makes

the

if

there

there

unfortunately
there
a

of

i
also
find
it
to
be
the

that
the

is
commercial

way
too
many

are

then
most
of

can

how

a

to
make

a

quality

how
much
would
it
cost

they
dont
have
a
conflict
because
technically
does
not
use
the
parallel
printer
processor
the
actual
number
escapes
me
contains
a
printer
control
register
which
enables
the
chip
to
transmit
an
interrupt
to
the
interrupt
controller
as
then
onto
the
main
processor
as
int
by
default
the
parallel
printer
processor
does
not
enable
its
interrupt
line
therefore
no
int
will
be
sourced
from
the
printer
controller
chip
thus
enabling
other
devices
to
use
the
actual
note
this
applies
to
com
ports
also
which
by

do
not
route
interrupts
to
the

coms

usually
enable

ill

cos
theyre

i
have

itll
have

a

it
will
also

when

a

an

that

im
not

if
this

work

how
about
using
one
of
those
t
expanders
used
in
the
lowprofile
cases
they
allow
slots
staggered
on
either
side
of
the

you
can
install

in

then
probably
have

sideways
slots
this

how
it

a

the
t
connector

i
guess
you
could
do
this
at

of
the

to
add
even
more
the

connectors
are
simply
tracks
with
slots
on

no

the

are

the

mine
get
the
second

port
on
his
dtk
io
plus
ii
card
working
and
it
does
not
want
to
cooperate
the
documentation
is
no
help
at
all
as
an
example
it
says
the
serial
port
can
be
changed
to
from
by
moving
jumpers
but
does
not
say
what
jumpers
to
move
there
are
banks
of
jumpers
the
first
one
is
labeled
as
follows
g
the
second
bank
is
labeled
irq
and
has
the
following
labels
i
have
determined
that
the
jumpers
tell
it
to
address
the
first
serial
port
as
or
the
jumpers
tell
it
to
use
the
printer
port
as
or
i
am
guessing
that
the
g
enables
the
game
port
and
the
should
enable
the
second
serial
port
but
i
cant
get
it
to
work
i
have
tried
numerous
setting
on
the
irq
bank
without
success
i
assume
that
this
bank
must
tell
the
card
which
irqs
to
use
for
both
ports
but
i
dont
know
how
any
suggestions
would

my

recently
my

got
a
second
internal

drive
a
seagate
i
can
look
up
the
model
number
if
its
important
and
ive
been
trying
to
help
him
install
it
ive
got
a
vested
interest
since
my
machines
busted
and
i
have
to
use
his
until
i
get
mine
fixed
he
already
has
a
seagate
ide
hd
again
i
forget
the
model
number
but
i
can
find
out
anyway
i
cant
seem
to
get
the
bloody
thing
up
ive
managed
to
get
one
or
the
other
drive
up
with
the
other
disconnected
but
not
both
at
the
same
time
whenever
i
try
the
thing
hangs
during
bootup
never
gets
past
the
system
test
the
ide
controllers
instruction
sheet
says
it
supports
two
drives
i
think
ive
configured
the
cmos
correctly
the
powers
plugged
in
properly
i
even
learned
about
the
masterslave
relationship
that
two
hds
are
supposed
to
have
didnt
know
pcs
were
into
sm
and
i
think
i
configured
the
jumpers
properly
the
one
is
the
master
the
new
one
is
the
slave
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
maybe
im
doing
the
cabling
wrong
ive
tried
several
combinations
controller
master
slave
controller
slave
master
master
controller
slave
none
of
them
worked
unfortunately
i
cant
think
of
any
others
another
possibility
is
that
the
one
is
already
partitioned
into
two
seperate
drives
c
and
d
and
the
cmos
asks
for
c
drive
and
d
drive
setup
info
rather
than
drive
and
drive
like
most
others
ive
seen
could
this
be
confusing
things
so
i
need
help
the
drive
came
bereft
of
any
docs
except
for
some
info
for
the
cmos
setup
the
controller
has
a
little
piece
of
paper
about
the
size
of

i
cannibalized
the
cable
its
one
of

with
a
connector
at

end
and
the

excrutiating
detail
describing
how
the

get
from

through

and
out
the

nowhere
do
i
see
anything
like
after

they
sit

i

thats
whats
happening
here
are
some
relevent
quotes
from

data
is
transferred
from

to
the
read

at
a

maximum

my

show
maximum

minimum

spins
at

with
sectors
per

on
the
outside
and
on
the
inside
single
burst
errors
of
up
to

within

can
be
corrected
onthefly
in
real

as
they
occur
allowing
a
high
degree
of

integrity
with
no

to
the

performance
i
take
this
to
mean
error
correction
isnt
the
bottleneck
for
pagemode
operations
the
datatransfer
rate
to
and
from
the
buffer
ram
is
up
to
mbs
this
high
transfer
rate
allows
the
at
interface
ic
to
communicate
over
the
at
bus
at
a
datatransfer
rate
of
mbs
while
the
dcs
simultaneously
controls
disktoram
transfers
so
the
thing
can
even
do
its
cache
prefetch
while
its
sending
the
requested
sector
it
has
read
buffers
for
prefetching
i
guess
you
could
call
that
a
cache
so
when
i
do
a
sequential
read
on

am

in
autoexecbat
and
doing
devicemousesys
in

the
only
difference
is
the
time
the
driver
gets
loaded
mousesys
will
be
loaded
during
the
configsys
and
therefor
before
the
commandcom
mousecom
will
be
loaded
during
autoexecbat
and
so
after
the
commandcom
which
one
is
better
mousecom
could
be
started
from
the
commandline
after
the
booting
and
it
could
perhaps
be
unloaded
if
no
other
driver
is
loaded
after
it
the
working
of
both
drivers
is
totally
the
same
when
i
ran
dos
i
preferred
loading
most
of
the
drivers
in
autoexecbat
because
some
programs
wont
run
with
some
drivers
and
i
could
choose
the
ones
i
needed
during
startup
but
with
this
advantage
is
gone
because
drdos
lets
you
choose
in
configsys
which
drivers
should
be
loaded

hello

i
just

it
i
currently
have
dd
the
last
version
i
am
very
pleased
with
its
performance
here
is
my
suggestion
if
you
do
not
have
any
compression
software
currently
i
would
go
with
dos
compression
all
the
discussion
on
the
net
indicates
that
for
you
get
the
compression
built
into
the
os
plus
the
other
utilities
that
you
would
pay
way
more
than
for
besides
you
are
now
at
whatever
that
means
if
you
have
doubledisk
already
like
i
do
the
cost
is
for
the
upgrade
after
thinking
about
it
and
asking
the
net
i
decided
that
i
could
not
go
wrong
with
the
update
cost
i
have
never
suffered
from
performance
of
dd
i
have
a
hd
with
large
sw
packages
in
both
compressed
and
uncompressed
format
it
works
great
not
delays
i
think
the
a
is
better
than
b
arguements
are
a
lot
of
bunk
they
are
all
comparable
in
performance
i
am
looking
forward
to
being
able
to
loadhigh
the
dd
sw
that
has
been
an
annoyance
if
you
have
stacker
etal
currently
i
would
not

it

was

bypass

moved

to

since
then
the

has
never

was

any

performance

a

bottom

is
this

im

just
in

cant
be
too
careful
not
that
i
doubt
that
your

depends
on
figuring

which
exact
svga
theyre
looking
at
and
dont

vesa
is
still
pretty
new
every

confuses
them
the

really
annoy
me
you
can
do
at
if
you
tell
the

you
have
an

they
only
have
about
six

if
you
choose
generic
you
cant
get
any
high
refreshes
at
all
but
at
you
are
limited
to
seems
to
me
that
the
hardware
should
be
able
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
at
it
sure
should
be
able
to
do
it
at

was
the
main
reason
i
bought
the

over
the

f
vlb
i
currently
have
and
it
will
do
hz
as
well
i
think
we
go
to
at
least
hz
at
and
maybe
more
and
its
a
function
of
the
ramdac
speed
not
the
power
we
need
to
fix
the
problems
youve
noted
they
were
already
on
the
list
if
youre
really
interested
though
take
a
look
at
the
text
file
which
holds
the
data
from
which
the
choices
in
the
monitor
installation
program
are
built
working
by
analogy
you
can
build
up
a
new
monitor
definition
that
has
the
right
combinations
of
refresh
rates
for
your
monitors
keep
a
backup
copy
of
the
file
once
youve
built
a
new
version
of
the

run
the
installation
program
inst
and
your

should
show
up
this
assumes
you
have
the
weitek
v
drivers
you
can
tell
the
rev
number
by
looking
at
the
modification
time
of
the
driver
is
version
microsoft
uses
this
gimmick
too
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
things
according
to
the
hercules
speedy
program
this
program
tests
various
operations
and
reports
the
results
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
the
graphite
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
was
running
in
a
isa
so
the
numbers
arent
really
comparable
the
following
numbers
were
all
obtained
using
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memory
i
give
ranges
because
the
program
reports
the
numbers
as
it
computes
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
the
speedy
benchmark
was
put
out
by
hercules
and
iit
who
to
my
knowledge
were
unencumbered
by
any
motivations
except
making
the
hercules
graphiteiit
card
look
really
good
so
id
take
the
numbers
with
a
ton
of
salt
texas
instruments
did
the
same
thing
with
wintach
trying
to
make
the
look
good
compared
to
the
as
if
anyone
cared
its
safer
though
not
safe
to
use
benchmarks
from
unbiased
sources
such
as
testing
labs
columnists
etc
interestingly
the
solid
vectors
and
shaded
polygons
show
no
improvement
and
hatched
polygons
ie
filled
with
crosshatching
and
ternary
rops
whatever
they
are
graphics
operations
like
xors
maybe
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
think
youll
a
large
discrepancy
between
the
results
of
speedy
and
the
results
of
anything
else
in
the
universe
on
these
things
i
give
two
numbers
for
the
fonts
because
i
think
they
are
caching
when
the
fonts
are
first
drawn
on
the
screen
they
are
done
fairly
slowly
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increases
dramatically
sounds
like
programming
to
a
benchmark
to
me
font
caching
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
optimization
windows
has
hooks
for
it
built
right
into

it
useless

elegance

you

just

you
happen

it
the

everything
seems

the

and
icons
start
deteriorating
after

startup

within

of
use
everything

is
totally
unintelligible
naturally
i
called
gateway
tech
support
to
inquire
about
this
the
technician
asked
me
about
the
drivers
and
i
told
him
it
was

he
told
me
that
the
and
bit
drivers
for
the
ati
ultra
pro
simply
do
not
work
is
this
true
if
so
im
simply
amazed
how
could
this
be
the

thing
is
i
would
have
expected
to
see
some
discussion
on
here
unless
the
subject
has
made
the
faq
one
very
suspicious
point
that
came
up
later
was
that
he
stated
that
none
of
the
windows
accelerator
boards
have
working
andor
bit
drivers
for
windows
i
easily
challenged
him
on
that
because
ive
been
running
a
diamond
in
bit
mode
at
home
for
months
now
and
i
have
tested
and
used
the
bit
mode
as
well
he
then
backed
off
and
said
well
diamond
has
been
working
on
those

much

anyway
i
just

one

ive
narrowed
the

down

somehow

i
notice
two
minor
irritations
a
under

when
an
entry
in
a
list
is
highlighted
such
as
in
an
open
menu
and
then
is
deselected
a
faint
vertical
line
often
remains
where
the
left
edge
of
the
highlighted
rectangle
used
to
be
b
with
word
for
windows
when
you
use
shading
in
a
table
the
display
shows
the
inverse
of
the
shading
for
example
if
you
shade
the
cell
as
the
display
is
the
printout
is
ok
the
big
killer
bug
is
using
the
borland
c
integrated
development
environment
the
problem
occurs
when
you
click
on
the
turbo
debugger
icon
or
use
the
debugger
option
in
the
run
command
and
the
debugger
application
goes
to
vga
character
mode
as
it
is
designed
to
do
the
screen
goes
haywire
and
is
largely
unreadable
the
turbo
debugger
display
is
all
garbled
through
trial
and
error
i
have
found
that
when
the
disrupted
screen
is
displayed
you
should
do
altspacebar
followed
by
the
letter
r
this
instructs
turbo
debugger
to
refresh
the
screen
and
it
does
this
satisfactorily
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
do
this
the
bug
is
more
than
with
the
diamond
drivers
the
same
disruptive
behavior
happens
with
the
standard
vga
driver
that
comes
with
windows
there
must
be
something
in
the
video
card
that
mishandles
the
vga
mode
the
problem
is
not
my
monitor
the
same
bug
shows
up
when
i
use
another
monitor
in
place
of
my
usual
one
i
still
like
this

asked

challenged
him

i
have
tested

used

as
well
he
then
backed
off

said
well

has

re
ide
cable
wrote
i
just
bought
a
new
ide
hard
drive
for
my
system
to
go
with
the
one
i
already
had
my
problem
is
this
my
system
only
had
a
ide
cable
for
one
drive
so
i
had
to
buy
cable
with
two
drive
connectors
on
it
and
consequently
have
to
switch
cables
the
problem
is
the
new
hard
drives
manual
refers
to
matching
pin
on
the
cable
with
both
pin
on
the
drive
itself
and
pin
on
the
ide
card
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
figure
out
how
to
tell
which
way
to
plug
in
the
cable
to
align
these
most
ide
drives
that
i
have
dealt
with
have
had
pin
labeled
on
the
printed
circuit
board
this
is
sufficient
to
determine
which
side
is
which
if
your
ide
drive
does
not
have
a
label
then
you
can
look
for
a
polarization
notch
in
the
receptacle
the
connector
on
the
drive
with
the
pins
if
the
receptacle
is
center
polarized
that
is
it
has
one
rectangular
notch
about
mm
wide
positioned
in
the
center
of
one
side
then
you
can
identify
pin
as
follows
look
into
the
pins
with
the
notch
at
the
top
pin
is
at
the
top
right
on
all
drives
i
have
seen
this
is
toward
the
power
connector
as
for
which
pin
is
pin
on
the
controller
well
you
can
use
the
same
criteria
but
look
hard
for
the
labelling
of
any
pin
once
you
know
which
end
pin
are
on
or
pins
the
oposite
end
then
you
are
all
set
all
you
need
to
do
is
keep
the
pin
end
connected
to
the
pin
end
you
dont
even
have
to
look
at
the
cable
itself
just
trace
the
pin
side
of
the
cable
through
usually
the
pin
of
the
cable
is
identified
by
a
different
color
red
usually
but
beware
many
cable
makers
are
not
very
careful
about
this
i
have
seen
cables
with
pin
being
the
one
marked
red
of
course
with
nonpolarized
connectors
this
doesnt
matter
you
can
plug
the
cable
in
either
way
and
you
decide
which
side
is
pin
secondly
the
cable
has
like
a
connector
at
two
ends
and
one
between
them
i
figure
one
end
goes
in
the
controler
and
then
the
other
two
go
into
the
drives
does
it
matter
which
i
plug
into
the
master
drive
and
which
into
the
slave
any
help
appreciated
thanks
it
doesnt
matter
what
gets
plugged
where
but
it
does
matter
how
the
drives
are
jumpered
there
will
be
amongst
other
options
two
jumpers
that
you
should
be
concerned
with
on
both
drives
one
jumper
will
select
whether
the
drive
is
the
slave
or
the
master
if
it
is
the
master
then
a
second
jumper
selects
whether
or
not
a
slave
is
present
you
will
have
to
consult
the
docuementation
that
came
with
you
drives
if
you
do
not
have
docuementation
then
just
call
the
manufacturers
hotline
number
or
fax
number
if
they
have
one
this
kind
of
information
is
routinely
needed
by
people
just
like
yourself
they
will
fax
you
complete
info
about
the
jumpers
if
you
dont
have
convenient
access
to
a
fax
machine
then
you
can
usually
get
voice
help

question

did

that
in

something
like
a
clock
has
to
make
a
get
date
system
call
apparently
the
clock
hardware
interrupt
and
bios
dont
do
this
date
advance
automatically
the
get
date
call
notices
that
a
midnight
reset
flag
has
been
set
and
then
then
advances
the
date
anybody
with
more
info
there
are
two
problems
the
bios
tod
routine
which
updates
the
bios
clock
uses
only
bit
for
day
increment
so
a
second
wrapping
of
the
clock
past
midnight
will
get
lost
if
no
one
calls
the
bios
to
read
the
clock
in
the
meantime
and
the
bios
resets
the
day
wrap
indicator
on
the
first
get
date
call
from
anybody
after
the
wrap
indicator
has
been
set
so
unless
the
first
bios
get
date
call
after
midnight
is
done
by
the
dos
kernel
which
is
the
only
part
of
dos
which
knows
how
to
increment
the
date
the
day
wrap
indication
is
normally
lost
my
guess
is
that
kevins
menu
system
uses
bios
calls
to
read
the
clock
in
order
to
display
the
time
and
is
hence
the
entity
which
causes
the
day
wrap
indication
to
get
lost
even
if
the
menu
system
notices
the
day
wrap
which
i
think
is
indicated
by
a
nonzero
value
in
al
there
really
isnt
any
particularly
good
way
to
tell
dos
about
it
so
that
dos
can
update
the
day
the
menu
system
should
use
dos
calls
to
get
the
time
which
would
cause
the
dos
kernel
to
do
the
bios
call
and
the
wrap
indicator
would
hence
be
processed
properly
possibly
though
the
menu
system
cant
easily
use
dos
calls
for
time
because
dos
is
not
reentrant

perhaps
time
incrementing

occur

if
you
are
handy
with
a
soldering
iron
the
loopback
plugs
are
easy
to
make
on
a
serial
ninepin
port
use
a
female
connector
and
connect
pins
to
to
to

to
to
for

youll
need
a

to
to
to
to
to
to
to
to

and
to
connected
to
test
a

youll

no

that

there

however
that

undergo

the

exists
if

the

the

ethernet

is
the
unique
electronic
serial

esn
assigned
to

this
is
a
physical

the
ip

is
a
higher

the
analogy
to
telephone

is
the
ip

is
your

the

to

assuming

it

not

to

of

the

can

there
could
hardly
be

to
ever

hello

still
the

around
function

is
there
any

to

clone
i
do
understand
that
the
new
at
keyboard
has
more
functionality
ie
the
typematic
repeat
rate
is
programmable
etc
it
seams
to
me
that
the
pins
electrical
specs
of
the
old
and
the
new
keyboard
are
however
the
same
maybe
the
communication
protocol
is
different
please
answer
by

also
if
you
can
tell

that
is

any
help

so
when
youve
got
multitasking
you
want
to
increase
performance
by
increasing
the
amount
of
overlapping
you
do
one
way
is
with
dma
or
bus
mastering
either
of
these
make
it
possible
for
io
devices
to
move
their
data
into
and
out
of
memory
without
interrupting
the
cpu
the
alternative
is
for
the
cpu
to
move
the
data
there
are
several
scsi
interface
cards
that
allow
dma
and
bus
mastering
how
do
you
do
busmastering
on
the
isa
bus
ide
however
is
defined
by
the
standard
at
interface
created
for
the
ibm
pc
at
which
requires
the
cpu
to
move
all
the
data
bytes
with
no
dma
if
were
talking
isa
at
bus
here
then
you
can
only
have
dma
channel
active
at
any
one
time
presumably
transferring
data
from
a
single
device
so
even
though
you
can
have
at
least
devices
on
a
scsi
bus
explain
how
all
of
those
devices
can
to
dma
transfers
through
a
single
scsi
card
to
the
isaat
bus
at
the
same
time
think
its
the
scsi
card
doing
the
dma
transfers
not
the
disks
the
scsi
card
can
do
dma
transfers
containing
data
from
any
of
the
scsi
devices
it
is
attached
when
it
wants
to
an
important
feature
of
scsi
is
the
ability
to
detach
a
device
this
frees
the
scsi
bus
for
other
devices
this
is
typically
used
in
a
multitasking
os
to
start
transfers
on
several
devices
while
each
device
is
seeking
the
data
the
bus
is
free
for
other
commands
and
data
transfers
when
the
devices
are
ready
to
transfer
the
data
they
can
aquire
the
bus
and
send
the
data
on
an
ide
bus
when
you
start
a
transfer
the
bus
is
busy
until
the
disk
has
seeked
the
data
and
transfered
it
this
is
typically
a
second
lock
out
for
other
processes
wanting
the
bus
irrespective
of
transfer
time
also
im
still
trying
to
track
down
a
copy
of
ibms
at
reference
book
but
from
their
pc
technical
manual
page
the
fdd
adapter
is
buffered
on
the
io
bus
and
uses
the

board
direct
memory
access
dma
for
record
data
transfers
i
expect
to
see
something
similar
for

the

this
is
an

between

the

really
fit

blowing
the

hi
everyone
i
have
a
question
regarding
my
stack
on
my
pc
i
am
programming
in
turbo
c
and
my
program
is
rather
large
model
large
too
i
keep
getting
errors
that
i
am
running
out
of
memory
after
a
while
of
running
the
program
when
i
compile
the
program
it
says
i
have
meg
of
ram
so
i
cant
seem
to
explain
why
it
crashes
all
it
is
doing
is
running
in
a
loop
while
the
operator
is
idle
and
after
a
while
of
sitting
it
will
screw
up
all
the
variables
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
my
stack
is
filling
up
and
overflowing
does
the
program
take
memory
up
when
it
is
calling
void
functions
that
do
not
return
anything
i
have
been
working
on
this
problem
for
days
and
i
would
really
appreciate
any
responce
if
this
is
not
the
correct
newsgroup
i
will
gladly
repost
but
this
is
the
only

could

the

could

not

as

the

that
you
have

is
not
conclusive
in
determining
the

manufacturer
either
boards
are
made
by

that
buy
the

brand

put
them
together
with

tend
to
doubt
your

is
with
your

also
anyway
perhaps
if
you
answer
those
questions
someone

can
i

i
have

however
the

remain
correct
if
anyone
knows
what
can
be
causing
this
please
let
me
know
most
likely
reason
is
that
your
backup
battery
is
failing
this
battery
maintains
the
contents
of
the
cmos
memory
when
ac
power
is
turned
off
and
if
the
battery
is
flakey
then
the
contents
of
the
cmos
will
be
lost
and
the
checksum
will
be
wrong
along
with
most
other
of
the
cmos
data
try
replacing
the
battery
if
however
your
pc
doesnt
use
a
battery
but
a
large
capacitor
to
power
the
cmos
you
should
check
to
see
if
you
can
replace
the
capacitor
with
a
more
normal
lithium
battery
if
this
isnt
possible
make
sure
you
leave
your
pc
on
for
a
half
hour
or
hour
each
day
this
will
keep
the
capacitor
charged
id
opt
for
the
battery
change
though
its
also
possible
but
unlikely
that
a
rogue
problem
or
even
a
virus
is
corrupting
the
cmos
if
your
battery
seems
okay
get
a

set

just

i

dos

from

for
my

to
go
with
the
one
i
already
had
my
problem
is
this
my
system
only
had
a
ide
cable
for
one
drive
so
i
had
to
buy
cable
with
two
drive
connectors
on
it
and
consequently
have
to
switch
cables
the
problem
is
the
new
hard
drives
manual
refers
to
matching
pin
on
the
cable
with
both
pin
on
the
drive
itself
and
pin
on
the
ide
card
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
cannot
figure
out
how
to
tell
which
way
to
plug
in
the
cable
to
align
these
secondly
the
cable
has
like
a
connector
at
two
ends
and
one
between
them
i
figure
one
end
goes
in
the
controler
and
then
the
other
two
go
into
the
drives
does
it
matter
which
i
plug
into
the
master
drive
and
which
into
the

should
still
check
your
software
i
will
eplain
a
couple
of
details
of
is
a
commumications
specification
for
communicating
between
a
computer
and
a
modem
actually
it
can
be
between
any
end
system
and
any
communications
hardware
the
terminology
used
is
data
terminal
equipment
dte
and
data
communications
equipment
dce
spells
out
the
voltage
levels
the
connector
type
the
pinouts
and
the
signal
protocols
the
connector
is
a
but
ibm
has
set
an
alternative
standard
of
the
primary
signals
are
transmit
data
td
recieve
data
rd
and
signal
ground
sg
there
are
other
signals
that
provide
control
between
the
dte
and
the
dce
for
example
the
dte
announces
that
it
is
powered
up
and
ready
to
participate
in
communications
via
the
data
terminal
ready
dtr
signal
dtr
is
an
output
on
the
dte
and
an
input
on
the
dce
similarly
the
dce
announces
that
it
is
ready
to
participate
in
communications
via
the
data
set
ready
dsr
signal
dsr
is
an
input
on
the
dte
and
an
output
on
the
dce
ok
thats
five
signals
there
are
only
four
more
of
interest
the
request
to
send
rts
signal
is
an
output
from
the
dte
and
an
input
to
the
dce
that
is
used
to
ask
the
dce
permission
to
send
data
if
the
dce
agrees
it
sends
an
ok
via
the
clear
to
send
cts
signal
for
completeness
the
cts
is
an
input
to
the
dte
and
an
output
from
the
dce
the
other
two
signals
of
interest
are
ring
indicator
ri
and
data
carrier
detect
dcd
these
are
both
inputs
to
the
dte
and
outputs
from
the
dce
ri
is
just
what
you
would
expect
a
signal
to
the
dte
saying
that
someone
is
attempting
to
establish
a
connection
to
the
dce
this
is
rather
specific
to
the
modem
telephone
line
setup
dcd
is
a
way
for
the
dce
to
announce
that
the
connection
has
been
established
ie
the
local
dce
is
talking
to
some
remote
dce
there
thats
it
oh
there
are
many
other
signals
defined
but
they
are
obsolete
i
have
explained
the
nine
signals
that
are
on
a
pc
the
pinouts
are
as
follows
name
sg
td
rd
dtr
dsr
dcd
rts
cts
ri
now
to
address
your
problem
at
hand
when
you
connect
a
pc
to
a
pc
a
dte
to
a
dte
there
is
no
dce
pair
in
the
middle
and
therefore
the
signal
definitions
dont
work
out
quite
right
there
is
no
dce
to
assert
the
cts
dsr
dcd
or
ri
so
the
common
thing
to
do
is
to
not
use
these
signals
at
all
and
also
forget
about
the
dtr
and
rts
outputs
as
well
if
this
is
done
you
simply
make
a
null
modem
a
cable
that
passes
through
sg
and
crosses
td
and
rd
ie
pin
of
one
end
connects
to
pin
at
the
other
end
etc
the
problem
with
this
solution
is
that
a
pc
that
wants
to
send
data
has
no
way
of
knowing
if
the
other
pc
is
ready
it
would
have
to
just
send
the
data
and
hope
it
got
through
therefore
a
better
null
modem
would
include
the
dtrdsr
pair
crossed
a
particular
point
a
confusion
is
in
the
software
area
just
because
you
run
the
wires
does
not
mean
that
the
soft
ware
will
use
them
if
you
are
using
the
builtin
bios
to
control
the
serial
port
then
the
bios
dictates
what
wires
you
need
and
how
they
are
to
be
used
but
if
you
have
a
comm
package
such
as
brooklyn
bridge
or
lap
link
or
telix
then
those
packages
dictate
the
cabling
requirements
the
only
thing
you
can
guess
reliably
is
the
sg
td
and
rd
the
dtrdsr
is
also
fairly
common
there
is
one
more
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
here
and
that
is
flow
control
in
the
scenerio
the
dces
are
responsible
for
flow
control
and
it
is
assumed
that
the
dce
couldnt
possible
overrun
the
dte
by
this
i
mean
that
as
long
as
the
dte
has
its
dtr
line
asserted
the
dce
will
send
data
without
requesting
permission
first
note
the
contrast
to
the
other
direction
of
data
flow
the
dte
must
request
permission
by
asserting
the
rts
line
and
it
must
wait
for
the
cts
signal
before
it
can
send
and
now
in
the
dte
to
dte
scenerio
the
question
is
do
you
need
flow
control
the
answser
is
usually
but
how
for
nonbinary
communications
one
common
technique
is
xon
xoff
which
is
implemented
in
software
no
wires
are
dedicated
to
flow
control
the
td
and
rd
carry
the
xon
and
xoff
commands
this
type
of
flow
control
can
be
used
in
addition
to
hardware
flow
control
but
the
problem
is
that
you
cant
send
binary
data
because
your
data
might
include
the
xon
or
xoff
codes
and
cause
erroneous
conrol
signals
a
work
around
is
to
have
the
software
insert
and
extract
escape
codes
but
the
hardware
flow
control
is
prefered
the
problem
with
hard
ware
flow
control
is
that
there
is
no
standard
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
do
it
and
i
bet
they
have
all
been
tried
one
cornerstone
of
all
the
methods
is
to
use
the
rtscts
for
one
direction
but
beyond
that
anything
is
fair
game
again
you
must
look
to
you
comm
package
for
cabling
requirements
but
i
bet
youll
find
that
one
cable
if
wired
properly
could
work
with
all
of
the
packages
as
long
as
they
are
of
the
same
vintage
by
the
way
i
am
familiar
with
one
package
that
uses
rtscts
and
dtrdsr
for
flow
control
the
rts
is
request
to
send
and
the
dtr
is
ready
to
recieve
the
cts
is
the
clear
to
send
and
the
dsr
is
the
request
to
recieve
this
does
not
mean
a
differnt
cable
it
is
just
software
the
clincher
to
all
of
this
cabling
stuff
is
that
it
is
common
to
have
the
uart
directly
controlled
by
the
cts
signal
which
means
that
the
cts
must
be
present
even
if
you
are
not
support
ing
it
in
software
for
these
cases
you
will
find
cables
that
short
the
rts
to
the
cts
at
the
same
end
or
perhaps
the
dtr
to
the
cts
other
possible
shorting
might
be
done
just
because
the
software
expects
certain
signals
that
you
dont
have
or
dont
feel
like
providing
because
it
would
mean
additional
wires
specifically
i
am
talking
about
the
dsr
shorting
the
dtr
to
the
dsr
is
not
a
good
idea
in
general
but
you
may
find
cables
like
this
it
is
a
bad
idea
because
it
defeats
the
whole
purpose
one
more
gotcha
signal
is
the
dcd
some
software
including
the
pc
bios
expects
to
see
the
dcd
before
it
will
work
this
signal
sometimes
gets
shorted
with
the
dtr
but
my
favorite
null
modem
has
the
rts
and
cts
shorted
at
each
end
but
the
rts
is
also
connected
through
to
the
other
end
and
connected
to
dcd
and
of
course
the
dtrdsr
are
crossed
as
are
the
tdrd
and
of
course
the
sg
must
pass
through
this
null
modem
works
with
most
software
the
flow
control
if
any
can
use
the
rtsdcd
with
the
dtrdsr
if
your
comm
package
does
not
specify
the
cable
required
for
pc
to

connection

i
suggest
you

had
the

gall
to
say
this
jcl
i
just
got
a
problem
i
have
a
cheapo
modem
which
i
use
to
jcl
connect
to
my

i
get
too
much

on

i
jcl
do
know
its
because
the
noise
in

i
can
actually
hear
it
jcl
so
my
question
is
will
an
error
correction
protocol
help
to
eliminate
jcl
this
garbage
my
modem
doesnt
have
any
of
these
on

can
a

software
implemented
protocol
do
the
trick
there
is
a
software
version
of
available
from
mtez
and
it
will
often
connect
with
other
modems
that
are
mnp
compatible
but
if
the

that
you
are
connecting
to
doesnt
support

it
wont
help

only
id
there
are

on
both

of

the
added
soeed
is
much
worth
the
price
of
error
correcting

modems
are

reasonable

they
are
only
about
slower

how
about

there
is

it

is

that
im

interested
in
the

any

would
be
greatly

i
need
to

any

sustain

no

and
has
nothing
to

with

no
the
simple
style
ide
controller

the

performs
the

transfer
the

only
the
smart

controllers
be
they
ide

transfer

these
controllers
tend
to
cost
the

wether
they
are
ide

scsi
to
get
the
dma
benefits
ide
must
sacrifice
its
price
advantage
on
the
controller
for
example
when
rewinding
or
formatting
a
tape
the
command
is
issued
to
the
controller
and
the
bus
is
released
to
allow
access
to
other
devices
on
the
bus
this
greatly
increases
productivity
or
at
least
do
something
else
while
backing
up
your
hard
drive
which
happens
to
be
what
i
am
doing
while
reading
this
group
you
can
thank
your
software
for
that
if
dos
had
a
few
more
brains
it
could
format
floppies
etc
while
you
were
doing
something
else
the
hardware
will
support
it
but
dos
at
least
wont
again
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
scsi
floppies
arent
on
the
ide
bus
your
arguement
makes
no
sense
this
isnt
an
ide
issue
the
floppys
have
their
own
processor
on
their
controller
board
which
handles
all
of
these
commands
the
difference
between
ide
and
scsi
is
that
all
scsi
peripherials
are
intelligent
they
each
have
their
own
controller
they
depend
on
the
cpu
to
do
fewer
things
for
them
ie
ide
drives
needing
a
processor
to
transfer
their
data
its
a
long
story
but
i
still
use
ide
on
my
except
for
the
cdrom
which
thanks
to
scsi
i
can
move
between
both
machines
if
and
when
scsi
is
better
standardized
and
supported
on
the
ibmclone
machines
i
plan
to
completely
get

you

the

alows

most

usually
the

has
a

a

you
can
type
from
debug
to
see
and
a
small
table
of

geometries
it
knows
about
sometimes
these
are
selectable
using
jumpers
on

sometimes
you
can
enter
them
manually
in

failing
that
you
must
use
a

program
like

upgrading
the
processor
on
machines
in
case
anyone
was
wondering
about
upgrading
their
or
class
machine
without
spending
a
lot
of
money
i
looked
into
replacing
the
processor
on
those
machines
and
here
are
the
facts
as
i
understand
them
if
you
have
a
model
or
model
you
can
replace
the
chip
with
either
a
cyrix
chip
for
which
will
increase
your
processing
power
by
about
for
normal
fuctions
and
not
at
all
for
math
functions
this
chip
will
only
run
at
your
original
clock
speed
ie
if
you
have
a
machine
the
cyrix
will
run
at
note
windows
does
not
use
the
math
functions
so
it
is
a
good
upgrade
if
you
are
running
windows
or
you
can
get
a
kingston
platform
for
with
a
on
it
which
will
increase
your
normal
processing
power
by
about
if
you
were
running
at
originally
but
again
it
will
not
increase
the
speed
of
your
math
fuctions
i
think
that
it
will
continue
to
run
at
even
if
your
original
processor
runs
at
a
slower
speed
there
is
also
the
kingston
platform
for
with
a
on
it
this
might
speed
up
your
math
functions
as
well
but
i
am
not
sure
if
you
have
a
model
or
other
machine
with
either
an
or
a
nonclock
doubling
ie
it
runs
at
either
or
in
it
then
you
can
get
an
intel
overdrive
chip
which
is
really
an
chip
and
replace
your
chip
with
it
you
should
get
about
better
preformance
for
both
normal
and
math
functions
the
mhz
version
of
the
overdrive
chip
costs
and
the
version
costs
the
replacement
for
the
chip
is
an
espeacially
good
deal
as
it
provides
the
math
coprocessor
which
the
does
not
have
note
that
the
speed
ratings
on
the
overdrive
chips
are
the
maximum
speed
at
which
they
can
run
if
you
have
a
then
the
overdrive
chip
will
run
at
ie
externally
and
internally
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
an
overdrive
chip
which
is
rated
at
faster
then
your
machine
you
will
not
get
faster
performance
you
should
be
able
to
buy
these
chips
from
any

the
microchip

that
advertise

ago
none
were
devoted
to
publishing
cdpub
has
just
been
setup
in
any
case
a
list
is
not
and
ought
not
be
a
replacement
for
regular
usenet
newsgroups
the
reason
for
the
division
into
three
groups
is
a
natural
partition
of
interest
between
the
hardware
and
software
topics
and
between
the
two
main
focal
points
of
software
ie
fulltext
and
multimedia
publishing
topics
such
as
cdrom
xa
cdi
cdr
photo
cd
and
other
related
formats
would
be
included
as
well
topics
related
to
cdrom
publishing
that
are
neither
clearly
hardware
or
software
related
such
as
books
copyright
issues
and
other
legal
matters
packaging
distribution
could
be
included
in
the
purvue
of
comppublishcdromsoftware
as
would
any
other
nonhardware
or
multimedia
topic
that
relates
in
some
way
to

in
any
format
and
is
appropriate
to
the

the
main
focus
of

sgml

as

the
main
focus
of

would
be
software
that
aids
in
the

authoring

process
audio
and

be

as
well
as

that

to

enduser
will
utilize
the
hardware
that
will
eventually
play
the

for
topics
such

long

i
read
npsomewhere
that
the

within

that

npslowly
diffuse

this
increases

hence
a

our

always
have

cooling
fan
on

npis
there
more
than
type
there
are
several

npdo
you
have
to
remove
the
cpu
from
its
scoket
to
install
the
fan
sometimes
depends
on
the
specific
fan
model
npdo
all

fans
derive
their
power
from
spare
drive
power
lines
all
the
ones
ive
seen
do
many
come
with
a

so
you
dont

to
have
a

npanyone
had
any
trouble
with
cpu
fans
none
npdoes
anyone
have
any
evidence
that
cpu
fans
are
a
complete
waste
of
money
touch
a
chip
after
its
been
running
a
few
minutes
you
wont
feel
the
fan
is
a
waste
nphow
are

attached

depends

use

make

you
use

ive

surprise
actually
after

im
surprised
that
they
even
have

running
i
have
a
choice
now
between
basically
the
above
system
but
with
a
with
isa

vlb
or
a
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thus
the
nonlocal

version
of

is
better
keeping

that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two
tasks
having
in
mind
the
size
of
the

my
opinion
is
to
go
with
vlb
it
has
much
more
bandwith
that
eisa
which
in

can
be
utilized
by
the

i
have
not
made
measures
so
someone
else
may
share
experience
on
that
also
the
is
faster
in
the
operations
that
run
off

slightly
slower
off
the
external
and
about

my

were
quite

i
have
performed
a

on

this

only
over
ethernet
while
our

sustain
on
the

network
going

the

version
of

increases
transfer

to

very

especially
when
moving
large

is
there
such
a

as
a

it

im
hoping
so
and
leaning
towards
the

above
for
that

the

theoretical
of

over

is

from

tried
my

ide
hard
drive
maxtor
and
got
the
same
results
regardless
of
the

speed
so
i
guess
that
just
the
carddrivers
combination
is
lousy
also
are
there
on
the
horizon
what
about
the
rumors
are
that
if
any
is
the
most
likely
chip
to
come
out
but
note
that
ibm
is
closest
to
the

an
it

only
sell
whole

so
youll
have

is

this

i
ordered
one
of

in

it
was
a

that
had
a

given

on

about

i
would
not

ordered
it
had
i
known
this
in

it
arrived
on
time
the
documentation
stated
that
it
would
work
and
was
preconfigured
as
providing
that
was
not
in
use
at
the

for
several
reasons
i
have
a
serial
card
configured
for
at
the
time
i
installed
the
modem
nothing
was
connected
to
although
the
modem
appeared
to
work
during
every
connection
at
or
it
would
randomly
break
the
connection
and
hang
up
the
phone
after
spending
some
time
on
the
phone
with
midwests
tech
support
they
suggested
disabling
the

this
appeared
to
solve
the
disconnect
problem
but
was
an
unacceptable
long
term
solution
i
had
to
have
and
available
even
though
they
both
would
not
be
in

at
the

as
the

i
called
back
minutes
prior
to
their
closing
and
waited
in

hell
listening
to
repeated
advertisements
for
midwest
micro
products
i
was
then
promptly
disconnected
apparently
it
was
quiting
time
and
they
didnt
want
to
be
bothered
with
callers
that
had
been
waiting
on
the

i
called
the

and
asked
the

she
promptly
switched
me

that

wasnt

suggested
i
use

nonstandard
irq
settings

i
was
not

should
work
as
originally
configured
conclusion
im
not

the

would
work
ok
in
a
basic
system
but
it
clearly
does
not
work
in
a
multi

like
mine
since

is
worth
more

i

turned

i
did

the

external
i
see
that
the
price
of
a

has
dramatically
dropped
to
below
but
the
price
of
the
courier
remains
above
anyone
with
knowledge
of
both
of
these
modems
or
anyone
that
owns
a
courier
the
courier
is
their
topoftheline
product
thus
the
higher
price
ive
never
taken
a
real
look
at
the
sportster
line
only
couriers
but
from
what
ive
gathered
its
basically
more
of
an
entrylevel
modem
probably
doesnt
meet
the
same
specifications
that
the
courier
does
im
not
sure
if
the
sportster
line
is
fully
dsp
driven
like
the
more
recent
courier
modems
are
so
upgrades
in
the
future
may
be
an
issue
again
take
all
of
the
above
with
a
grain
of
saltive
never
evaluated
the

so
im
going
by
bits
and
pieces
that
ive
heard
if
you
want
a
real
answer
post
the
question
in
compdcommodems
and
youll
find
people
who
have
worked
with

personally
though
if
i
were
going

id
buy

id
get

you

you

the

below
at

in

if
someone

youll
see
a
flurry
of
folks
correcting
them
to
avoid
spreading
faulty
info
the
sportster
at
has
error
control
and
bis
data
compression
just
as
it
does
at
lower
speeds
too
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
either
ccitt
recommendation
or
that
says
that
they
can
only
operate
on
modems
that
are
running
of
course
is
currently
only
standardized
for
operation
on
top
of
in
its
primary
mode
of

lapm
but
thats
about
as
far
as
that
goes
and
just
in
case
theres
some
confusion
on
this
are
also
supported
by
the
courier
line
unless
you
have
a
really
ancient
one
the
difference
with
the
courier
is
that
it
can
run
at
and
only
in
the
hst
mode
take
a
second
look
at
the
original
question
in
a
previous
article
holly
ks
says
what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
external
see
the
up
there
the
question
was
not
about
the
courier
hst
modem
or
about
the
courier
dual
standardit
was
about
the
courier
modem
the
modem
in
question
does
not
support
hst
period
it
therefore
does
not
support
the
kb
hst
also
not
all
courier
hst
courier
dual
standard
modems
support
the
kb
version
of
hst
my
dual
standard
only
supports
hst
at
kb
there
are
even
older
models
that
only
run
hst
at
kb
this
is
a
proprietary
mode
of
usr
and
it
will
only
connect
to
another
of
the
same
type
unit
to
achieve
this
speed
hst
is
usrs
proprietary
modulation
scheme
but
were
not
talking
about
hst
were
talking
about
is
most
definitely
not
a
proprietary
modulation
scheme
the
sportster
will
do
asynchronous
transmissions
as
well
as
synchronous
the
hst
is
one
way
only
i
do
hope
you
didnt
mean
for
these
two
sentences
to
be
related
in
some
way
first
off
and
are
both
synchronous
and
asynchronous
this
is
part
of
the
ccitt
recommendation
ie
part
of
the
standard
it
isnt
a
feature
unique
to
the
sportster
i
just
looked
at
the
appropriate
chapter
in
the
courier
ds
manual
second
hst
is
not
one
way
only
more
correctly
put
it
is
an
asymmetrical
modulation
scheme
meaning
it
doesnt
work
at
the
same
speed
in
both
directions
hst
operates
at
in
one
direction
and
has
a
lowspeed
backchannel
in
the
other
direction
the
highspeed
channel
goes
in
the
direction
of
the
higher
data
flow
this
is
fine
if
youre
logged
on
to
say
a
bbs
and
type
one
letter
and
get
screens
of
info
back
transfer
files
not
using
bimodem
etc
there
is
of
course
a
penalty
for
turnaround
time
when
the
highspeed
channel
needs
to
reverse
directions
and
are
both
symmetrical
meaning
they
do
transfer
the
full
data
rate
in
both
directions
at
the
same
time
third
synchronous
vs
asynchronous
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
symmetrical
vs
asymmetricalthey
are
two
completely
different
topics
the
hsts
will
be
upgradeable
to
the
vfast
spec
when
it
is
available
again
more
correctly
put
some
of
the
courier
line
will
be
upgradeable
to
whatever
vfast
is
called
when
its
complete
if
you
have
the
large
footprint
courier
modems
like
i
do
youre
sol
there
was
an
upgrade
plan
a
while
back
to
upgrade
to
a
small
footprint
variety
which
could
eventually
be
upgraded
to
support
vfast
but
the
cost
of
the
two
upgrades
together
pretty
much
put
it
higher
than

re
any
info
on
cyrix
chip
it
seems
that
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
regarding
the
cyrix
compatible
and
my
info
comes
directly
from
cyrixs
fast
fax
service
and
also
from
installing
one
of
these
chips
in
an
ibm
model
the
is
a
instruction
set
compatible
cpu
which
fits
into
a
socket
pin
grid
array
or
pga
the
dlc
currently
is
available
in
speeds
the
the
and
the
they
do
not
have
a
coprocessor
on
board
but
any
software
query
will
return
coproc
as
present
i
guess
they
emulate
the
coproc
instructions
math
functions
are
on
the
level
without
the
actual
coprocessor
the
internal
cache
on
the
is
cyrix
literature
claims
a
hit
rate
my
informal
tests
show
that
the
cache
accounts
for
a
performance
boost
when
it
is
enabled
by
software
overall
performance
boost
from
a
to
a
is
about
the
benchmarks
i
used
were
nu
si
and
qaplus
dhrystones
and
whetstones
the
performance
with
the
cache
enabled
is
about
on
a
par
with
my
with
external
cpu
cache
which
is
around
the
performance
for
a
the
computer
runs
noticebly
faster
and
dos
with
dblspace
is
not
complaining
the
company
claims
compatibility
but
i
didnt
test
it
the
is
not
a
chip
as
commonly
thought
the
is
actually
a
small
daughterboard
slightly
larger
than
the
which
contains
the
logic
to
manage
the
clock
doubler
this
board
plugs
into
the
pga
and
the
or
plugs
into
this
board
i
guess
the
board
doubles
the
frequency
apparent
to
the
cpu
and
insert
wait
states
when
access
to
the
rest
of
the
system
is
required
there
are
no
info
available
from
cyrix
there
anyway
the
is
available
for
and
only
double
these
clock
rates
and
you
get
the
and
the
dlcs
if
cyrix
is
planning
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
then
they
need
to
put
out
the
first
i
also
tested
a
motherboard
along
with
a
cyrix
coprocessor
with
external
cache
performance
were
about
faster
than
the
but
still
significantly
slower
than
an
actual
intel
imho
the
dlc
is
a
great
low
price
upgrade
for
people
who
cant
afford
or
cant
install
a
new
motherboard
it
is
definitely
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
but
if
you
need
performance
the
wont
cut
it
im
not
sure
about
the
but
i
think
even
if
it
matches
the
performance
it
wont
beat
it
in
any
significant
way
the
last
time
i
posted
info
about
the
dlc
people
sent
quite
a
bit
of
mail
asking
where
i
got
it
so
here
is
where
i
got
mine
treasure
chest
peripherals
they
advertise
in
the
computer
shopper
the
kit
was
but
i
liked
the
chip
so
much
that
i
found
the
supplier
and
became
a
dealer
if
you
are
interested
in
the
chip
email
me
and
i
can
fax
or
mail
you
more
info
im
well
aware
of

did

well
that
something
i
thought
about

as
i
have
a

the

i
mounted
the

so
that
it
just
blows
air
at

its
heatsink
instead
work
just
like
a

but
the
realy
biggy
to
think
about
is
after
the
whine
goes
away
on
the
fan
if
the
fan
should
stop
burn
out
how
would
you
ever
know
this
before
the

goes

at

with

they
may
of
thought
that
you
didnt
know
what
you
were
doing
and
suggested
how
to
correct
the
problem
but
it
sounded
as
you
didnt
give
them
much
of
a
chance
to
correct
things
at
all
the
fact
that
the
ppi
worked
okay
for
you
is
because
it
is
setup
more
for
the
no

user
that
cant
understand
the
instruction
and
the
commands
to
configure
it
to

when
you
find

the
fact
the
the
ec
led
that
looks

you
have
connected

modem
doesnt
realy
say
that
but
that
it
only
tells
you
that
you
have

turned

on

i
think
that
these

are
nothing
more
that
just
light
to
hype
up
the
product
just
like
i
bet
someone
took

a

there

need

what
type

is
the
quantum
i
have
tried
others
but
i
think

the

is
best
value
for
money
connect
the
drive
to
the
adapter
via

cable
and
the
power
cable
do
i
have
to
worry
about
the

i

i
have

all
im
powering
are
two

the

you
can
mix
the
two
types
of

unless
you
have

scsiide

that
is

you
will
have
to
turn

is

drive
instructions
for
drive
type
are

with

it
may
be
a

no

what
the

is
with

it
may

no

was

create

do
i
use

is
it
the

how

work
i
have

i
was
told
that
it
should
be

that
they
had
no
idea
how
it
might
be
done
nor
did
they
particularly
care
to
investigate
ok
heres
my
results
so
far
you
have
to
define
the
monitor
as
lcd
it
doesnt
really
support
analogue
video
input
it
works
but
isnt
very
linear
the
incoming
sync
pulses
need
inverting
this
is
best
achieved
with
either
a
cmos
xor
package
or
a
transistor
inverter
if
you
dont
know
how
to
do
it
dont
even
contemplate
it
itll
only
work
in
standard
vga
mode
ok
having
said
that
im
trying
to
either
find
a
circuit
or
ic
which
will
act
as
a
universal
sync
decoder
i
want
somethikng
which
basically
only
detects
the
leading
sync
pulse
edge
and
doesnt
care
about
the
polarity
outputting
the
ve
going
pulses
that
the
atari
monitor
requires
there
are
reasons
for
doing
this
vga
cards
change
their
sync
polarity
depending
which
mode
theyre
in
herc
emulation
is
while
mvga
is
for
example
it
means
i
dont
have
to
put
a
toggle
switch
on
the
back
of

monitor
in
order
to
be
able
to

it

both
the
atari
and
my

currently
i

monitors

neither

the

advantage
however
note
that

can

to

if

adding

is
what
brings

would

to

how
my

pro

and
my

card
are

successfully
i
assure
you
that
they
are
both
set
to
irq
and
that
i
have
no
problem
my
computer
is
a
dtk
ibm
clone
running
msdos
or
a
derivative
os
obviously
please
take
note
that
the
following
is
not
what
exactly
happens
but
a
slightly
simplified
explanation
technically
the
irq
line
is
only
a
means
for
the
device
printer
adapter
soundblaster
modem
hard
disk
to
signal
the
cpu
that
somethings
happening
here
please
take
note
how
the
cpu
is
programmed
to
handle
this
signal
is
usually
up
to
the
operating
system
in
msdos
the
interrupt
vector
is
used
to
store
the
address
of
the
function
that
handles
each
interrupt
now
basic
dos
doesnt
care
whether
the
printer
reports
that
its
ready
to
print
some
more
stuff
or
not
it
simply
ignores
the
interrupt
when
dos
prints
it
looks
at
the
lpt
buffer
if
theres
a
character
there
wait
a
while
and
check
again
if
theres
not
copy
a
new
character
to
the
lpt
port
since
the
irq
is
ignored
as
a
printer
interrupt
its
free
for
use
for
any
other
adapters
in
this
case
the
sb
with
any
multitasking
or
otherwise
advanced
os
this
kind
of
printing
approach
just
doesnt
work
or
more
precisely
it
wastes
a
lot
of
cpu
cycles
hence
you
cant
share
the
irq
with
and
sb
if
youre
running
unix
or
or
whatnot
another
issue
with
the
sb
is
that
only
the
digitized
sound
uses
interrupts
when
the
sb
plays
plain
music
the
cpu
simply
tells
it
what
to
play
until
told
otherwise
with
digitized
sound
the
interrupt
is
required
to
notify
the

you

hook

but
use

only
one
at

this
is
because
the

is

for
both

it

from

hercules
vlb
a
couple
of
months
ago
i
tried
out
a
hercules
graphite
card
a
pretty
nice
board
fairly
fast
and
seemed
quite
compatible
even
seemed
to
handle
the
svga
modes
i
have
whined
about
here
on
occasion
at
the
time
i
was
just
buying
a
vlb
system
so
after
checking
out
the
card
i
sent
it
back
i
wanted
a
vlb
card
and
purchased
a
fahrenheit
vlb
card
this
card
is
fairly
fast
will
do
hz
refresh
at
but
is
not
compatible
with
my
cdroms
the
svga
thing
i
think
i
have
merely
conjectured
that
is
the
cause
of
an
old
graphics
board
being
able
to
run
in
a
higher
resolution
with
those
programs
than
the
modern
boards
i
have
tried
i
have
not
gotten
a
straight
answer
out
of
anybody
the
monitor
i
am
using
it
with
is
a
magnavox
which
also
tops
out
at
hz
so
its
really
a
pretty
good
match
but
that
is
for
my
wife
i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
for
myself
and
am
looking
for
a
graphics
card
to
drive
it
i
want
refresh
and
would
really
like
it
to
handle
my
cdroms
i
tried
the
orchid
which
did
neither
of
those
things
though
robert
at
wietek
did
say
that
the
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the
driver
data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
any
info
would
be
most
appreciated

use

there
are
a

of

to
mount

plug

produce

is
for
my

i
just
purchased
a
viewsonic
for
myself
and
am
looking
for
a
graphics
card
to
drive
it
i
want
refresh
and
would
really
like
it
to
handle
my
cdroms
i
tried
the
orchid
which
did
neither
of
those
things
though
robert
at
wietek
did
say
that
the
was
possible
if
i
modifed
the
driver
data
base
so
my
thoughts
go
back
to
hercules
they
were
supposed
to
be
coming
out
with
a
vlb
version
of
the
graphite
around
the
end
of
march
i
have
heard
precisely
zero
about
it
since
then
does
anyone
know
if
the
card
was
actually
released
and
what
capabilities
and
price
it
has
hmm
your
cdrom
program
must
be
using
some
oddball
vga
modes
i
think
they
are
trying
to
get
it
out
by
the
end
of
this
month
when
it
is
released
though
itll
be
in
limited
quantities
i
think
they
have
quite
a
back
order
right
now
the
megs
version
will
come
out
a
bit
later
since
you
have
a
viewsonic
i
think
it
has
a
horizontal
frequency
right
youre
gonna
love
the
megs
version
it
can
do
at
at
at
at
it
can
also
do

and
bit
at
too
bad
i
dont
have
such
a
high
bandwidth
monitor
like
yours
most
of
those
modes
need
a
monitor
otherwise
youll
have
to
use
a
lower

if
you
want

is
it
easy

does
it
need
any
kind
of

or
is
it
completely
transparent
to
the

board
so
that
i
wont
have
to
change
the

configuration
yes
its
easy
to
use
its
just
like
an
ordinary
controller
you
dont
have
to
change
the
bios
config
is
it
transparent
to
the
ide
drive
will
it
work
with
any
drive
or
does
it
have
to
be

explicity
for
the
type

installed
its
transparent
it
works
with
any

if
you
change
the

you
only
need
to
change
the

as
usual
will
it
work
with
a
dualdrive
system
master
and

yes
no
problem
with
it
will
i
need
smartdrive
or
dos
buffers
that
depends
you
will
get
a
little
better
performance
if
you
use
smartdrive
and
buffers
in
addition
thats
because
access
to
the
card
through
the

is
slower
than
access

i
dont
use
smartdrive
myself

i

will
think
for

do
what
you
never

couldnt

doing

ran

it
worked
fine
for

thats
worth
also
dblspace
is
crap
it
writes
about
slower
than
stacker
reads
about
slower
and
compresses
about
less
all
tests
were
made
on
the

computer
with
the

no
cache
and
the

big

were
used
couldnt

more
on
my
i
dont
miss
the
speed
its
still
faster
than
a
normal
disk
read
would
be
as
for
the
less
compression
ive
sacrificed
that
in
favor
of
the
convenience
of
having
the
dblspacebin
load
before
anything
else
with
stacker
any
changes
to
your
configsys
or
autoexecbat
meant
rebooting
twice
so
it
could
update
those
personally
im
waiting
for
stacker
to
come
out
and
implement
those
hooks
and
stuff
plus
the
defrag
that
comes
with

is
okay
but
i
much
prefer
compress
from
pctools
for
sheer

defrag

my

came
with

bought
it
and
i
just
got
a
ide
hd
maxtor
that
i
wanted
to
add
as
a
slave
drive
i
did
change
the
jumper
settings
on
maxtor
to
configure
it
as
slave
drv
but
i
didnt
change
anything
on
my

since
i
didnt
have
any

on

as
i
predicted
it

hi

heres
another

ive
been

thingy
without

no

so
far
when
i
dismantled
it
i
discovered
that
it
is
really
just
a
standard
rgb
monitor
with
built
in

software
etc
phillips
kindly
labelled
the
circuit
board
with
the
rgb
inputs
so
i
connected
it
up
as
a
monitor
and
he
presto
it
worked
sort
of
the
problem
is
that
i
have
no
idea
where
to
connect
the
sync
lines
the
display
rolls
continuously
but
does
change
modes
ok
only
to
cga

useful
for

any
of
you
wonderful

any
knowledge

ive
tried

told
me
that
he
has
had

i
as
a
number
of
poeple
in
this
thread
have
already
written
i
cant
prove
its
true
but
i
believe
it
does
not
actually
use
even
though
that
interrupt
is
supposed
to
be
dedicated
to
to
put
it
a
little
differently
irq
is
the
de
facto
standard
interrupt
assigned
to
be
used
by
the
printer
adapter
to
announce
its
completion
of
some
activity
dos
doesnt
monitor
irq
it
uses
other
means
to
determine
when
its
time
to
send
out
another
byte
to
the
printer
most
all
hardware
printer
adapters
have
the
ability
to
disable
the
use
of
irq
usually
by
merely
breaking
the
connection
between
the
isa
pin
and
the
associated
driver
other
adapters
control
the
irq
line
by
a
tristate
driver
and
by
programming
just
leave
it
in
the
highimpedence
mode
unfortunately
there
are
a
lot
of
adapter
cards
which
use
bistate
drivers
ie
either
assert
high
or
assert
low
for
the
irq
lines
rather
than
tristate
drivers
assert
high
assert
low
or
dont
assert
anything
the
presence
of
such
a
card
on
an
irq
line
precludes
the
use
of
that
irq
by
any
other
adapter
unless
it
is
physically
disconnected
by
a
jumper
incidentally
note
that
theres
no
requirement
that
a
card
hold
the
irq
line
low
when
no
interrupt
is
desired
if
that
were
true
you
would
have
to
somehow
tie
down
all
unconnected
irq
lines
and
that
certainly
isnt
a
requirement
nondos
operating
systems
nt
various
unices
or
whatever
the
proper
plural
of
unix
might
be
require
the
use
of
irq
for

alas
is

expect

my
question
is
why
isnt
there
any
substantial
interest
in
developing
the
flopticals
certainly
in
the
uk
the
flopticals
are
about
the
same
price
as
a
cheap
cdrom
now
you
seem
to
be
able
to
get
them
for
around
gbp
however
the
bigger
optical
drives
eg
are
much
more
expensive
around
the
gbp
mark
a
couple
of
questions
that
someone
may
be
able
to
answer
the
flopticals
are
they
direct
drop
in
replacements
for
a
floppy
or
do
they
need
driver
software
etc
ie
do
you
just
rip
out
the
floppy
drive
plug
the
same
cables
into
the
floptical
stick
in
a
floptidisk
and
hey
presto
you
have
a
floppy
this
sounds
far
too
easy
on
the
subject
of
sony
developing
mds
for
computers
i
have
reread
a
pcw
article
on
this
subject
and
there
it
says
that
sony
have
been
doing
optical
drives
for
other
people
for
some
time
and
may
be
about
to
do
a
product
themselves
from
the
article
it
seems
that
the
audio
md
format
is
a
byproduct
of
their
computer
storage
work
the
md
mechanism
is
identical
to
their
mo
computer
optical
drives
a
sony
spokesman
was
quoted
as
saying
that
a
md
disk
would
hold
about
of
data
though
he
refused
to
comment
on
any
possibility
of
this
being
productized
the
article
said
that
one
of
the
problems
holding
back
development
in
this
area
was
lack
of
sensible
standards
plus
there
are
at
least
distinct
optical
storage
mechanisms
around
at
present
given
that
it
probably
needs
mds
being
used
as
a
distribution
medium
to
get
it
into
the
market
and
since
this
has
already
been
cornered
by
cds
it
probably
needs
someone
to
come
in
with
a
very
strong
marketting
lead
to
get

our

only
sent
one

the

that
a
the

i
had
ordered
two
wouldnt
work

b
the

had
no
clue
as
to
how
it
should
work
it
also
turned
out
that
c
one
of
the
two
modems
they
sent
was
clearly
used
but
the
techs
thought
that
was
standard
practice
and
d
the
modems
made
all
three
of

quit
working

my

start
running

that

is
one

that
they
sell

i
tried

the

our

obviously
couldnt
handle

at

it
worked
perfectly
i
dont
know
which

the

uses

it
has
an

so
you
can

re
bios
passwords
some
of
our
students
change
the
ami
bios
passwords
on
a
few
of
our
computers
and
set
it
for
always
what
wed
like
to
know
is
if
there
is
a
way
to
bypass
or
remove
the
password
we
have
tried
switching
bios
but
to
no
avail
the
battery
is
soldered
to
the
bord
an
all
three
machines
is
still
under
guarentee
so
if
that
would
have
help
we
cant
remove
the
batteries
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
way
to
get
around
the
bios
password
except
by
shorting
out
the
power
supply
to
the
cmos
memory
thereby
erasing
it
this
will
remove
the
password
but
it
will
also
destroy
all
the
previous
bios
settings
so
then
youll
have
to
go
and
set
them
all
up
again
on
my
there
is
a
jumper
on
the
motherboard
which
is
provided
for
the
purpose
of
shorting
the
battery
you
just
short
this
jumper
briefly
and
it
interrupts
power
to
the
cmos
long
enough
to
erase
it
i
would
imagine
there
is
something
like
this
on
your
board
too
in
the
future
i
would
suggest
that
you
set
the
password
and
leave
it
on
setup
only
that
way
noone
else
can
go
and
reset
it
or
set
it
to
always
unless
they
know
what
password
you
used
they
had
to
do
this
over
here
too
when
they
got
a
bunch
of
new
for
just
the

isa
graphic

info

hi
that
might
look
like
a
dull
request
but
i
have
been
following
this
newgroup
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
it
didnt
help
me
make
my
mind
i
bought
a
new
machine
not
long
ago
after
being
disconnected
from
the
pc
world
for
a
while
i
have
been
running
on
an
xt
till
last
january
the
machine
i
bought
came
equipped
with
a
ati
vga
xl
graphic
card
it
gives
a
very
nice
picture
and
the
windows
drivers
are
pretty
stable
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
quite
slow
i
would
like
to
go
for
a
faster
card
not
in
the
range
i
saw
a
lot
of
comments
on
many
products
over
the
last
weeks
but
didnt
get
an
overall
picture
clear
enough
to
make
a
choice
my
question
is
could
somebody
direct
me
to
a
source
of
information
which
would
help
me
in
my
quest
i
would
like
to
get
information
about
the
refresh
rates
the
various
cards
provide
quality
of
windows
drivers
standard
vga
performance
nonwindows
stuff
direct
me
to
a
magazine
article
or
something
like
that
i
got
winvidzip
info
but
it
is
not
enough
if
you
have
an
isa
card
you
are
really
satisfied
with
it
let
me
know
if
this
information
is
of
any
use
here
is
my
system
configuration
fujikama
isa
system
contaq
motherboard
monitor
darius
noninterlaced
multisync
up
to
can
reach

i
would
also
like
to
know
if
it
is
a
standard
for
video
drivers
to
allow
screen
dimensioning
and
screen
positioning
by
writing
on
the
eprom
of
the
graphic
card
this
is
the
case
with
my
ati
card
and
it
is
very
convenient
when
changing
graphics
mode
since
my
monitor
is
not
intelligent
enough
to

would

kind
enough
to

i

i
read
somewhere
that
the
regions
within
a

that
define

slowly
diffuse
over

and
this
increases
with
temperature
hence
a

goes

has
anyone

ive
even
considered
stuffing
my

that
wouldnt
be
the
most

you

yes
this
is
a
valid

imho
with

ive
seen
it
looks

if

were

cooling
would
be
a
good
bit
worse
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in

words
if
the
fan
stops
the
unit
turns
into
an
insulator
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to

not

stop

temporarily
i
prefer
to
put
a

off
the

brackets

front
panel
to
blow
air
across
the

depends
a

on

layout
though
my

has
a
passive
heat
sink
on
the

and
its
located
so
the
front
fan
which
sucks
air
into
the
case
blows
right
on
the
heat
sink
if
that
fan
stops
the
heat
sink
is
still
cooled
by
convection
air
flow
so
should
not

too
dramatic

yes
this
is
a
valid
concern
imho
with
the
directly
attached

units
ive
seen
it
looks
like
if
the
fan
were
to
stop
the

cooling
would
be
a
good
bit
worse
than
no
heat
sink
at
all
in
other
words
if
the
fan
stops
the
unit
turns
into
an
insulator
and
the
chip
might
get
hot
enough
to
suffer
permanent
damage
not
just
stop
working
temporarily
a

this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
my
friend
claims
that
there
will
be
little
difference
in
the
temperature
of
an
idle
cpu
and
a
cpu
running
a
computationally
intensive
job
from
what
ive
seen
in
coursework
most
cpus
never
actually
idle
they
will
continue
to
service
interrupts
etc
etc
the
clock
will
always
be
running
at
n
mhz
no
matter
what
its
doing
i
suppose
depending
on
the
instruction
the
cpu
may
use
circuitry
which
has
more
transistors
than
other
instructions
but
if
you
consider
the
additional
heat
generated
by
only
a
handful
of
additional
tiny
resistors
and
then
spread
that
heat
dissipation
over
the
cpus
packaging
the
change
in
temperature
to
the
immediate
environment
ie
the
surface
of
the
package
will
be
negligible

its

i
took

i
used

ive
also

seeks

the

during

is

approximately

what

i
totally
agree
with
your

since
when
the

is
apparently
idle
it
is
still
in
fact
churning
away
millions
of
instructions
per
second
checking
for
keyboard
input
for
instance
the
exception
to
this
is
for
cpus
used
in
laptops
where
the
cpu
can
enter
an
idle
state
where
it
is
just
preserving
its
current
status
but
doing
absolutely
nothing
in
this
case
it
needs
a
hardware
interrupt
to
get
it
going
again
actually
the
family
has
a
halt
instruction
that
causes
the
cpu
to
cease
processing
instructions
the
cpu
resumes
processing
either
by
being
reset
or
by
receiving
an
external

interrupt
this
is
different
from
the
power

facilities
victor
mentions
of

whether
an
operating

idle
loop
uses
the
halt
instruction
is
another
matter

after

im
still
unclear
about
one
thing
these
new

hard

is
the
cache
on
the
drive
itself
or
is
it
separate
like
on
the

or
something
thanks
to
anyone
who
can
clear
this
up
i
have
two
scsi
hard
drives
each
has
of
cache
there
several
reasons
for
this
when
the
drive
has
read
requested
data
from
the
disk
the
scsi
bus
may
be
busy
this
data
needs
to
be
stored
some
where
until
the
bus
is
free
and
the
data
can
be
transmitted
when
the
drive
receives
data
to
be
written
the
data
can
come
down
the
bus
faster
than
the
drive
can
write
it
to
the
disk
it
needs
to
be
stored
somewhere
while
the
disk
is
writing
it
out
in
these
situations
the
memory
is
being
used
as
a
buffer
not
a
cache
may
be
the
drive
does
some
readadead
caching

also

the
one
that
almost
all
nonlaptop
pcs
use
two
separate
interface
cards
cannot
share
an

this
is
due
to
a
screwup
in
the

design
for
example
if
your
soundblaster
wants
to
drive
interrupt
number
then
it
must
hold
a
certain
bus
wire
to
or
at
all
times
depending
on
whether
or
not
it
wants
an

this
precludes
letting
another
card
assert
interrupt
number
when
two
or
more
devices
in
an
isa

pc
share
an

its
because
theyre
implemented
by

would
you
care

then
how
my

pro

and
my

card
are
sharing
irq
successfully
i
assure
you
that
they
are
both
set
to

and
that
i
have
no
problem
my
computer
is
a
dtk
ibm
clone
simple
first
andrew
is
correct
although
i
can
see
where
there
might
be
some
confusion
it
is
indeed
possible
to
have
two
cards
configured
to
use
the
same
interrupt
they
can
not
share
the
interrupt
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
possible
to
have
both
cards
active
at
the
same
time
here
is
an
example
for
some
time
i
was
short
of
free
interrupts
i
had
a
tape
controller
not
a
floppy
tape
that
needed
one
of
its
an
old
tape
drive
my
solution
was
to
use
also
used
for
where
my
modem
is
i
did
this
because
i
reasoned
i
would
never
be
using
the
modem
and
the
tape
simultaneously
when
kermit
runs
it
installs
its
own
interrupt
handler
for
and
uses
the
serial
port
if
the
tape
drive
were
to
generate
an
interrupt
kermit
would
not
have
a
clue
what
to
do
withfor
the
tape
controller
and
since
the
tape
controller
would
not
be
serviced
it
would
most
likely
hang
likewise
when
the
tape
backup
software
runs
it
installs
an
interrupt
handler
for
that
handler
wont
do
anything
for
the
serial
port
under
dos
printing
is
not
interruptdriven
instead
the
bios
polls
the
status
of
the
parallel
port
to
determine
when
another
byte
may
be
sent
thats
why
you
can
have

info
or
help
with
upgrading
this
board
to
mbyte
there
are
rows
of
pins
over
the
vram
chips
i
think
for
a
piggyback
board
of
vram
i
would
like
to
hear
from
anyone
that
may
be
able
to
help
me
upgrade
this
board
maybe
someone
from
headland
who
maybe
read
ing
this
has
one
of
these
piggyback
boards
just
laying
around
please
please
please
does
anyone
know
of
where
i
could
maybe
buy
the
upgrade
for
this
i
would
sure
love
to
use
this
in
color
mode
but
for
the
time
being
i
can
only
get

the

with

obviously
because
of
the
missing
vram
actually
im
surprised
it

degree
at

as
a

i
will
wind
